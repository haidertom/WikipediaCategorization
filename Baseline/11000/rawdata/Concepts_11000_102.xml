'''Access to public information''' and '''[[freedom of information]] (FOI)''' refer to the right of access to information held by public bodies also known as "right to know". Access to public information is considered of fundamental importance for the effective functioning of democratic systems, as it enhances governments' and public officials' accountability, boosting people participation and allowing their informed participation into public life. The fundamental premise of the right of access to public information is that the information held by governmental institutions is in principle public and may be concealed only on the basis of legitimate reasons which should be detailed in the law.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.unesco.org/new/en/communication-and-information/freedom-of-expression/freedom-of-information Freedom of Information, UNESCO. {{Retrieved|access-date=2016-10-16}}]&lt;/ref&gt; 
 
In the course of [[Enlargement of the European Union|EU accession negotiations]] [[Croatia]] harmonised its media legislation to European standards. This process touched also legislation on access to public information which has been amended to reflect European and international standards.&lt;ref name=KAS&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.kas.de/wf/en/71.13596/ |title=Media Freedom in Croatia (2006-2016) |last= |first= |date=2016 |website= Kas.de |publisher=KAS Media Program South East Europe |access-date=6 February 2017 |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
Croatia thus adopted its law on the Right of Access to Public Information in 2013, after a decade of advocacy, campaigns, and public discussions led by civil society organisations.&lt;ref name=FH&gt;{{cite web |url=https://freedomhouse.org/report/freedom-press/2015/croatia |title=Croatia. Freedom of the Press 2015 |last= |first= |date=2015 |website=Freedomhouse.org |publisher=Freedom House |access-date=6 February 2017 |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=ECPMF&gt;{{cite web |url=https://ecpmf.eu/news/ecpmf/interviews-balkan/barbara-matejcic-freelance-journalist-croatia |title=”I can’t say it raised the level of general transparency” |last= |first= |date=12 January 2017 |website= Ecpmf.eu |publisher=European Centre for Press and Media Freedom |access-date=6 February 2017 |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, despite the improvements of the legal framework regulating access to public information, problems remain in the implementation, especially for journalists willing to request and obtain information from the government.&lt;ref name="KAS" /&gt;
 
==Legal framework==
 
In Croatia, access to public information has become a constitutional right with the 2010 amendments of the Constitution.&lt;ref name=GONG&gt;{{cite journal |author=Nives Miošić and Duje Prkut  |date=July 2012 |title=Access to information in Croatia: Exercise of a Constitutional Right in an Institutional Culture of Secrecy|url= https://dgap.org/sites/default/files/article_downloads/GONG%20(Zagreb)_Access%20to%20information%20in%20Croatia.pdf  |publisher=GONG Policy Research Center |issue= |access-date=6 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is regulated by the '''Law on the Right to Access Information''' adopted by the [[Croatian Parliament]] in 2013. The Law also regulates the [[re-use of information]] held by public authorities. The Law complies with the Directive 2003/98/EC of the [[European Parliament]] and of the [[European Council|Council]] on the re-use of public sector information and with Regulation 1049/2001 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 30 May 2001 regarding public access to European Parliament, Council and Commission documents.&lt;ref name=Law&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.revizija.hr/en/access-to-information/law-on-the-right-to-access-information |title=Law on the Right of Access to Information |last= |first= |date= |website=Revizija.hr |publisher=Republic of Croatia. State Audit Office |access-date=6 February 2017 |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
According to the Law, the right of access to information encompasses the right of the beneficiaries, i.e. any local or foreign natural person or legal entity, to seek and acquire information, as well as the obligation of public authorities to guarantee access to requested information, regardless of the request.&lt;ref name=Law/&gt;
 
The Croatian law on Access to public information is  in informed by four principles:
 	
* the principle of '''publicity''' and '''free access''', meaning that information are available to any national or foreign natural persons or legal entity as established by the Law;
* the principle of '''timeliness, entirety and accuracy''' of information, meaning that information disclosed under the Law must be timely provided, complete and accurate;
* the principle of '''equality''', meaning that the right of access to information is granted to every beneficiary in an equal manner;	
* the principle of '''disposal of information''', meaning that beneficiaries that obtained the information in accordance with the Law, are entitled to disclose this information in public.&lt;ref name=Law/&gt;

Public bodies are obliged to publish on the Internet the following relevant information: laws and other regulations in their field of activity, including draft proposals of laws; general acts and decisions affecting the interests of beneficiaries; annual plans, programmes, strategies and financial reports referring to the work of public authority bodies; information on budget, financing sources and subsidies; information on their internal organisation; notes and conclusions from official sessions; information on public procurement and tenders; information on the way of exercising rights of access to and re-use of information, including contact details of the Information Commissioner and the fee required to access and re-use of information.&lt;ref name=Law/&gt;
 
For the purpose of ensuring the right of access to information, the Law establishes that public bodies are obliged to appoint an [[Information commissioner|Information Commissioner]], a special official in charge of resolving the issues emerging from the exercise of the right of access to information. Specifically, the Information Commissioner shall conduct the tasks connected to disclosure of public information in accordance with the Law, including providing the necessary assistance to applicants, improving the manner of processing, classification and safe-keeping of the information, and maintaining the Information Commissioner Register.&lt;ref name=Law/&gt;

===Restrictions to the right of access to information===
 
Public authority bodies may restrict access to information if:
 		 
* the information has been classified, in accordance with the law regulating classified information;
 
* if the information represents a trade or professional secret;
 
* in the information is a tax-related secret;
 
* is the information is protected by the law regulating the protection of personal information;
 
* the information may seriously undermine an ongoing decision-making process;
 
* the information is restricted in accordance with international treaties.
 
Moreover, restrictions may be operated when there can be reasonable doubts that disclosing the requested information might  prevent the efficiency, independence or impartiality of ongoing proceedings or the execution of court orders and sentence.&lt;ref name=Law/&gt;
 
===Proportionality Test and Public Interest Test===
 
The public authority body in charge of acting upon the request of access to information is obliged to conduct the Proportionality Interest Test in order to reach the decision about disclosure. [[Proportionality Test and Public Interest Test]] refer to the assessment of proportionality between reasons for granting access to information and reasons for imposing restrictions and granting access to information only when the public interest prevails. If, on the basis of the Test, the public interest prevails over the damage caused to other protected interests, the information shall be disclosed.&lt;ref name=Law/&gt;
 
===Procedures===
 
Public authorities are bound to grant access to information by timely publishing the information on their work in an accessible manner, i.e. on the webpage, or in the Official Gazette and the Central catalogue of officials documents of the Republic of Croatia, etc. Information can be provided directly, or in writing, or by giving insight into documents and making copies of the documents containing the requested information, or by delivering copies of the requested information.&lt;ref name=Law/&gt;
 
Applicants can submit the request either orally or in written form. The submitter of the request is not obliged to mention any reason for requesting access to information.&lt;ref name=Law/&gt;
 
Access to public information does not require paying any administrative and court fees. The beneficiaries might only be called to pay for the actual costs of providing the information requested.&lt;ref name=Law/&gt;
 
Authorities are obliged to issue their decisions within 15 days from the day of submitting a request. This deadline can be prolonged  by other 15 days in case of complex requests (e.g. when the information must be sought outside the offices of the public authority concerned, when a single request contains a request for different information, or when the situation requires to conduct the Proportionality Test and Public Interest Test, etc.) &lt;ref name=Law/&gt;
 
If the public authority does not hold the information, it is obliged to transfer the request to the body that might have it and notify the submitter thereof.&lt;ref name=Law/&gt;
 	
===Right to appeal===
 
Against the Decision taken by the public authority, the applicant may file a Complaint to the Commissioner within 15 days since the Decision has been delivered. 
 
No complaint may be filed against the decision issued by the Commission, but an administrative dispute may be initiated before the High Administrative Court of the Republic of Croatia.&lt;ref name=Law/&gt;
 	
===Re-use of information===
 
The Croatian law on access to public information regulates also the right to re-use information for commercial or non-commercial purposes.&lt;ref name=Law/&gt;
 

==Access to public information in practice==
 
The Croatian law on access to public information is quite advanced and in line with international standards and best practices. However, in the country a culture of secrecy persists. &lt;ref name=MySociety&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.mysociety.org/2016/09/29/journalists-celebrate-freedom-of-information-croatia/  |title=Journalists celebrate Freedom of Information: Croatia |last= |first= |date=29 September 2016 |website=Mysociety.org |publisher=mySociety |access-date=6 February 2017 |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the law, by itself, has not changed this and so far it has not raised the level of general transparency in Croatian society and institutions.&lt;ref name=ECPMF/&gt;&lt;ref name=MySociety/&gt;
 	
One of the main problem affecting the realization of the right of access to public information is the lack of adequate resources allocated to the office of the Commissioner. According to the 2015 Report on the implementation of the law presented to the Parliament, an increase in the resources for the functioning of the Commissioner’s Office if compared with previous years, they are still too limited to allow for the full application of the law. Over the course of 2015, the number of cases dealt with by the Commissioner’s Office has increased. However, the report showed that, due to a lack of staff and resources, not all the complaints received during 2015 have been solved by the Commissioner’s Office.&lt;ref name=HALTER&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.balcanicaucaso.org/aree/Croazia/Croazia-al-di-sopra-dell-opinione-pubblica-17749 |title=Croazia: al di sopra dell'opinione pubblica |last=Gabrić |first=Toni |date=14 February 2017 |website=Balcanicaucaso.org |publisher=Osservatorio Balcani Caucaso Transeuropa|language=Italian |access-date=14 February 2017|quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
Another problem concerns the limited application of proactive disclosure, which - according to the Commissioner [[Anamarija Musa]] - together with re-use of information, a milestone of access to public information in the 21st century.&lt;ref name=HALTER/&gt; Also, according to Commissioner Musa, the implementation of the law is particularly problematic at regional and local level and when it comes to requesting information to private entities providing a public service or to enterprises where the state holds the majority of capital shares.&lt;ref name=HALTER/&gt; Moreover, Commissioner Musa deems particularly concerning the fact that access to public information requests are regularly ignored, so that the two thirds of the overall complaints received by the Commissioner are caused by this reason.&lt;ref name=HALTER/&gt;
 
===''Imamo pravo znati'' (“We have right to know”) platform===
 	
In Croatia, the web platform imamopravoznati.org, developed using the Alavetely software, has been launched to facilitate citizens' exercise of the right of access to public information. It allows to submit requests for public information to Croatian public authorities, and track their answers. Historic requests, any correspondence between the applicant and public authorities, are archived and publicly online.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://imamopravoznati.org |title= Imamo pravo znati |last= |first= |date= |website=Imamopravoznati.org |publisher= |access-date=6 February 2017 |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Andersen Healthcare Utilization Model - ''' is a [[conceptual model]] aimed at demonstrating the factors that lead to the use of health services. According to the model, usage of health services (including inpatient care, physician visits, dental care etc.) is determined by three dynamics: predisposing factors, enabling factors, and need. Predisposing factors can be characteristics such as race, age, and health beliefs.  For instance, an individual who believes health services are an effective treatment for an ailment is more likely to seek care. Examples of enabling factors could be family support, access to health insurance, one's community etc. Need represents both perceived and actual need for health care services. The original model was developed by Ronald M. Andersen, a health services professor at [[UCLA]], in 1968. The original model was expanded through numerous iterations and its most recent form models past the use of services to end at health outcomes and includes feedback loops.&lt;ref name="revisiting"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Andersen|first=Ronald|title=Revisiting the behavioral model and access to medical care: does it matter?|journal=J Health Soc Behav|year=1995|volume=36|issue=1|pages=1–10|pmid=7738325|doi=10.2307/2137284}}&lt;!--|accessdate=2012-01-31--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

== Access and Mutability==
A major motivation for the development of the model was to offer measures of access. Andersen discusses four concepts within access that can be viewed through the conceptual framework. Potential access is the presence of enabling resources, allowing the individual to seek care if needed. Realized access is the actual use of care, shown as the outcome of interest in the earlier models. The Andersen framework also makes a distinction between equitable and inequitable access.  Equitable access is driven by demographic characteristics and need whereas inequitable access is a result of social structure, health beliefs, and enabling resources.

Andersen also introduces the concept of mutability of his factors. The idea here being that if a concept has a high degree of mutability (can be easily changed) perhaps policy would be justified in using its resources to do rather than a factor with low mutability. Characteristics that fall under demographics are quite difficult to change, however, enabling resources is assigned a high degree of mutability as the individual, community, or national policy can take steps to alter the level of enabling resources for an individual. For example, if the government decides to expand the [[Medicaid]] program an individual may experience an increase in enabling resources, which in turn may beget an increase in health services usage. The [[RAND Health Insurance Experiment]] (HIE) changed a highly mutable factor, out-of-pocket costs, which greatly changed individual rates of health services usage.&lt;ref name="rand hie"&gt;{{cite book|last=Newhouse|first=J|title=Free for All? Lessons from the RAND Health Insurance Experiment|year=1993|publisher=Harvard University Press|isbn=0-674-31846-3|url=http://www.rand.org/pubs/commercial_books/CB199.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Earlier Models==
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Lifecycle andersen.png|thumb|right|alt=Earlier versions of the Andersen model.|Lifecycle of the Andersen Model.&lt;ref name="revisiting" /&gt;]] --&gt;
The initial behavior model was an attempt to study of why a family uses health services.  However, due to the heterogeneity of family members the model focused on the individual rather than the family as the unit of analysis. Andersen also states that the model functions both to predict and explain use of health services.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Andersen|first=R|author2=Newman JF|title=Societal and individual determinants of medical care utilization in the United States|journal=Milbank Mem Fund Q Health Soc|year=1973|volume=51|issue=1|pages=95–124|pmid=4198894|doi=10.2307/3349613|pmc=2690261}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A second model was developed in the 1970s in conjunction with Aday and colleagues at the [[University of Chicago]]. This iteration includes systematic concepts of health care such as current policy, resources, and organization. The second generation model also extends the outcome of interest beyond utilization to consumer satisfaction.&lt;ref name=second&gt;{{cite journal|last=Aday|first=Lu Ann|author2=Andersen R|title=A framework for the study of access to medical care|journal=Health Serv Res|year=1974|volume=9|issue=3|pmid=4436074|pmc=1071804|pages=208–20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The next generation of the model builds upon this idea by including health status (both perceived and evaluated) as outcomes alongside consumer satisfaction. Furthermore, this model include personal health practices as an antecedent to outcomes, acknowledging that it not solely use of health services that drives health and satisfaction. This model emphasizes a more public health approach of prevention, as advocated by Evans and Stoddart&lt;ref name=evans&gt;{{cite journal|last=Evans|first=RG|author2=Stoddart GL|title=Producing health, consuming health care|journal=Soc Sci Med|year=1990|volume=31|issue=12|pages=1347–63|pmid=2126895|doi=10.1016/0277-9536(90)90074-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; wherein personal health practices (i.e. smoking, diet, exercise) are included as a driving force towards health outcomes.

== Current Model ==
The 6th iteration of Andersen’s conceptual framework &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Andersen|first1=Ronald M.|last2=Davidson|first2=Pamela L.|last3=Baumeister|first3=Sebastian E.|title=Improving Access to Care in: Chaning the U.S. Health Care System|url=https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Sebastian_Baumeister/publication/306017030_Andersen2014_Improving_Access_to_Care_in_Kominski_Changing_the_US_Health_Care_System/data/57aace3e08ae42ba52ad8a24/Andersen2014-Improving-Access-to-Care-in-Kominski-Changing-the-US-Health-Care-System.pdf|website=researchgate.net |publisher=Jossey Bass|accessdate=16 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; focuses on the individual as the unit of analysis and goes beyond health care utilization, adopting health outcomes as the endpoint of interest.  This model is further differentiated from its predecessors by using a feedback loop to illustrate that health outcomes may affect aspects such as health beliefs, and need.  It added genetic susceptibility as a predisposing determinant and quality of life as an outcome &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Andersen|first1=Ronald M.|last2=Davidson|first2=Pamela L.|last3=Baumeister|first3=Sebastian E.|title=Improving Access to Care in: Chaning the U.S. Health Care System|url=https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Sebastian_Baumeister/publication/306017030_Andersen2014_Improving_Access_to_Care_in_Kominski_Changing_the_US_Health_Care_System/data/57aace3e08ae42ba52ad8a24/Andersen2014-Improving-Access-to-Care-in-Kominski-Changing-the-US-Health-Care-System.pdf|website=researchgate.net |publisher=Jossey Bass|accessdate=16 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  By using the framework’s relationships we can determine the directionality of the effect following a change in an individual’s characteristics or environment. For example, if one experiences an increase in need as a result of an infection, the Andersen model predicts this will lead to an increased use of services (all else equal). One potential change for a future iteration of this model is to add genetic information under predisposing characteristics.&lt;ref name=true&gt;{{cite journal|last=True|first=WR|author2=et. al|title=Genetic and environmental contributions to healthcare need and utilization: a twin analysis|journal=Health Ser Res|year=1997|volume=32|issue=1|pages=37–53|pmid=9108803|pmc=1070168}}&lt;/ref&gt; As genetic information becomes more readily available it seems likely this could impact health services usage, as well as health outcomes, beyond what is already accounted for in the current model.&lt;ref name=rosenau&gt;{{cite journal|last=Rosenau|first=PV|title=Reflections on the cost consequences of the new gene technology for health policy|journal=Int J Technol Assess Health Care|year=1994|volume=10|issue=4|pages=546–61|pmid=7843877|doi=10.1017/s0266462300008151}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticisms and Rebuttals==
The model has been criticized for not paying enough attention to culture and social interaction but Andersen argues this social structure is included in the ''predisposing characteristics'' component.&lt;ref name=guendelman&gt;{{cite journal|last=Guendelman|first=S|title=Health care users residing on the Mexican border. What factors determine choice of the U.S. or Mexican health system?|journal=Med Care|year=1991|volume=29|issue=5|pages=419–29|pmid=2020207|doi=10.1097/00005650-199105000-00003}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Portes|first=A|author2=Kyle D |author3=Eaton WW |title=Mental illness and help-seeking behavior among Mariel Cuban and Haitian refugees in south Florida|journal=J Health Soc Behav|date=Dec 1992|volume=33|issue=4|pages=283–298|pmid=1464715|doi=10.2307/2137309}}&lt;!--|accessdate=2012-01-30--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;  Another criticism was the overemphasis of  need and at the expense of health beliefs and social structure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Wolinsky|first=FD|author2=Johnson RJ|title=The use of health services by older adults|journal=J Gerontol|date=Nov 1991|volume=46|issue=6|pages=S345-57|pmid=1940101|doi=10.1093/geronj/46.6.s345}}&lt;/ref&gt;  However, Andersen argues need itself is a [[social construct]].  This is why need is split into perceived and evaluated. Where evaluated need represents a more measurable/objective need, perceived need is partly determined by health beliefs, such as whether or not people think their condition is serious enough to seek health services. Another limitation of the model is its emphasis on health care utilization or adopting health outcomes as a dichotomous factor, present or not present. Other help-seeking models also consider the type of help source, including informal sources.&lt;ref&gt;Wilson, C. J., Deane, F. P., Ciarrochi, J., &amp; Rickwood, D. (2005). Measuring help-seeking intentions: Properties of the General Help-Seeking Questionnaire. Canadian Journal of Counselling, 39(1), 15-28.&lt;/ref&gt; More recent work has taken help-seeking behaviors further, and more real-world, by including online and other non-face-to-face sources.&lt;ref&gt;Harris, K. M., McLean, J. P., &amp; Sheffield, J. (2009). Examining suicide-risk individuals who go online for suicide-related purposes. Archives of Suicide Research, 13(3), 264-276. doi: 10.1080/13811110903044419. {{PMID|19591000}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Andries Tatane''' (22 February 1978 – 13 April 2011) was a 33-year-old South African citizen who was shot and killed by police officers during a [[Protest in South Africa|service delivery protest]] in [[Ficksburg]]. Seven police officers accused of his murder and assault were acquitted in the Ficksburg Regional Court in March 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Court acquits police officers in Andries Tatane case|url=http://www.bdlive.co.za/national/2013/03/28/court-acquits-police-officers-in-andries-tatane-case|accessdate=11 April 2013|newspaper=Business Day|date=28 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Tatane: So many questions remain |url=http://www.citypress.co.za/news/tatane-so-many-questions-remain/ |accessdate=11 April 2013 |newspaper=City Press |date=31 March 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130410192628/http://www.citypress.co.za/news/tatane-so-many-questions-remain/ |archivedate=10 April 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==

Andries was a member of the [[African National Congress|ANC]] until 2008 when he left the ANC to join the breakaway party [[Congress of the People (South African political party)|COPE]]. In the months before he died he left COPE to join the Meqheleng Concerned Citizens (MCC), an autonomous local community organisation.&lt;ref name=MGWhoWasAT&gt;{{cite news|last=Sosibo|first=Kwanele|title=Who was Andries Tatane?|url=http://mg.co.za/article/2011-04-21-who-was-andries-tatane|accessdate=16 August 2011|newspaper=Mail &amp; Guardian|date=21 April 2011|quote="He was a very brilliant student, a pioneer by nature. He was very skilled in initiating things that would benefit others. He wanted to see all the people freed from unemployment and illiteracy."}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He was a mathematics teacher, a community activist, journalist, community newspaper publisher and possible independent candidate for the municipal elections due to take place in May 2011.  He was married to Rose Tatane.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.whoswhosa.co.za/andries-tatane Andries Tatane entry at ''Who's Who of Southern Africa'']&lt;/ref&gt;

==Events surrounding his death==

On 13 April 2011, Andries Tatane, together with 4,000 other protesters, took to the streets and marched to [[Setsoto Local Municipality|Setsoto Municipal Offices]] in Ficksburg, Free State, South Africa to protest against poor service delivery in the area. The protesters were met by [[South African Police Service|police members]] who attempted to disperse the crowd with water cannons. While some arrested protesters were being bundled into police vans, Tatane tried to argue with the police and to block a water cannon vehicle, at which point he was grabbed around one arm by a police officer. Tatane was seen to pull his arm away from the officer who then started to beat him with a baton. Tatane appeared to move aggressively towards this officer. Four or five other police officers then pulled him away and began to kick and beat him with batons. During this time he was twice shot in the chest. Tatane collapsed shortly after and died on the scene 20 minutes later.

While Tatane's death as a result of police action during a protest is by no means a unique event in South Africa, it had notably garnered greater nationwide attention than any previous such occurrence. One of the main reasons for this was the fact that the entire incident was filmed on T.V. cameras and later broadcast during the prime time evening news of the national broadcaster, the SABC.

==Aftermath==

Following Tatane's death, there has been public outrage about the manner in which he died.&lt;ref&gt;Several opinion pieces in South African newsmedia:
*{{cite news|last=Mahabane|first=Itumeleng|title=Death in Ficksburg shows how we value life|url=http://www.businessday.co.za/articles/Content.aspx?id=140341|newspaper=Business Day|date=15 April 2011}}

Tatane's death has been described as "a watershed moment in public perceptions of state violence after apartheid".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thedailymaverick.co.za/opinionista/2011-05-05-it-is-time-to-be-offended It is time to be offended], Herman Wasserman &amp; Sean Jacobs, ''The Daily Maverick'', 8 May 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

An investigation into his death was launched by the [[Independent Complaints Directorate]]'s commission. The [[South African Police Service]] has also launched their own internal investigation into the matter. The death of Tatane has placed both the issue of rising anger over a lack of service delivery as well as police brutality in the media spotlight, with comparisons being drawn&lt;ref name=Sowetan&gt;{{cite news|last=Mngxitama|first=Andile|title=Tatane's death underlines need for government to deliver|url=http://www.sowetanlive.co.za/columnists/2011/04/19/tatane-s-death-underlines-need-for-government-to-deliver|accessdate=23 April 2011|newspaper=The Sowetan|date=19 April 2011|quote=Hector Pieterson was the symbol of the 1976 uprising in the same way that Tatane is the symbol of service delivery struggles today.}}&lt;/ref&gt;  to the deaths of [[Hector Pieterson]] and [[Steve Biko]] at the hands of police during the height of [[apartheid]].

It has also emerged that this was not an isolated incident&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iol.co.za/news/politics/amnesty-red-flag-police-brutality-1.1068706 Amnesty red flag police brutality], Craig Dodds, 13 May 2011&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.amnesty.org/en/region/south-africa/report-2011 Amnesty International South Africa Report 2011]&lt;/ref&gt; and that the ICD has investigated 1,769 separate incidents of people dying in police custody or as a result of police action in 2010.&lt;ref name=M&amp;GIsolatedIncident&gt;{{cite news|last=Ilham|first=Rawoot|title=Protester's death not an isolated case|url=http://mg.co.za/article/2011-04-15-protesters-death-not-an-isolated-case/|date=15 April 2011|accessdate=23 April 2011|newspaper=Mail &amp; Guardian|author2=Underhill, Glynnis|quote=Video footage of the protester, identified as 33-year-old Andries Tatane, caused shockwaves when it was broadcast on SABC (South African Broadcasting Corporation) prime time news on Wednesday evening.}}&lt;/ref&gt;  National Police Commissioner [[Bheki Cele]]'s statement in late August 2009 that police officers should be able to "shoot to kill"&lt;ref name=IOLShootToKill&gt;{{cite news|last=Carvin|first=Goldstone|title=Police must shoot to kill, worry later - Cele|url=http://www.iol.co.za/news/south-africa/police-must-shoot-to-kill-worry-later-cele-1.453587|accessdate=23 April 2011|newspaper=IOL News|date=1 August 2009|quote=Cele's philosophy on shooting before being shot, which he has preached in KwaZulu-Natal during his time as MEC for community safety, has led to the province having more deaths in police custody under review than any other province during the past year. There were 258 deaths in custody in KZN during 2008/2009 - 83 more than the previous year.}}&lt;/ref&gt;  without worrying about the consequences will undoubtedly be brought to the forefront again.

The [[African National Congress|ANC]]'s National Spokesperson, [[Jackson Mthembu]], condemned the brutality, but also chastised the [[SABC]] for broadcasting the footage during the prime time news, citing the fact that it might have upset sensitive viewers,&lt;ref name=M&amp;GIsolatedIncident/&gt; calling on the [[Independent Communications Authority of South Africa]] (ICASA) to investigate the SABC's editorial decision.  Mthembu has been one of the most vocal supporters of planned legislation to introduce a [[Media Appeals Tribunal]] to govern the South African media;&lt;ref name=M&amp;GMediaTribunal&gt;{{cite news|last=Mandy|first=Rossouw|title=ANC backtracks on media tribunal|url=http://mg.co.za/article/2011-01-14-anc-backtracks-on-media-tribunal/|accessdate=23 April 2011|newspaper=Mail &amp; Guardian|date=14 January 2011|quote=In July last year Mthembu was adamant there should be even harsher punishment for errant journalists. "If you have to go to prison, let it be. If you have to pay millions for defamation, let it be. If journalists have to be fired because they don't contribute to the South Africa we want, let it be," he told the Mail &amp; Guardian.}}&lt;/ref&gt; legislation which is currently held in abeyance.

After visiting the Tatane family in Meqheleng, Ficksburg, on 19 April 2011, [[Archbishop of Cape Town|Anglican Archbishop of Cape Town]], Dr [[Thabo Makgoba]], directed attention to the lack of justice and delivery on promises which had preceded the incident and points out the irony of the protesters having been met with water cannons, "attacked with the very thing they don’t have the pleasure of in their daily lives."  He called on the Minister of Co-operative Governance and Traditional Affairs, [[Sicelo Shiceka]], to "visit and see the appalling conditions under which God’s people live" and the Minister of Human Settlements, [[Tokyo Sexwale]], to "provide houses".  He added that "Minister [[Nathi Mthethwa]] and President [[Jacob Zuma|Zuma]] should publicly apologise for this embarrassing act of aggression by police."&lt;ref&gt;[http://archbishop.anglicanchurchsa.org/2011/04/visit-to-ficksburg-and-tatane-family.html  Visit to Ficksburg and Tatane Family, by the Most Revd Dr Thabo Makgoba, Archbishop of Cape Town, blog dated 21 April 2011]&lt;/ref&gt;

The Archbishop has subsequently said: "Let us affirm and call for a renaming of our police services back to 'safety and security' and not a police 'force', for this force seems to maim and kill rather than offer safety and security." &lt;ref&gt;[http://archbishop.anglicanchurchsa.org/2011/04/sermon-at-service-for-renewal-of-vows.html Archbishop Thabo Makgoba’s Sermon at the Service for the Renewal of Vows, Maundy Thursday, 21 April 2011, published 22 April]&lt;/ref&gt;

There was an election boycott in the area following Tatane's death.&lt;ref name="mg.co.za"&gt;[http://mg.co.za/article/2011-05-20-disillusioned-voters-snub-ficksburg-poll Disillusioned voters snub Ficksburg poll], KWANELE SOSIBO, ''Mail &amp; Guardian'', 20 May 2011]&lt;/ref&gt; In May 2011 it was reported that the Meqheleng Concerned Citizens group was a credible structure with growing influence.&lt;ref name="mg.co.za"/&gt; However, by December 2011 it had degenerated to the point of being described as "a toothless organisation led by calculating tenderpreneurs".&lt;ref&gt;[http://mg.co.za/article/2011-12-23-ficksburg-the-dorpie-where-revolution-was-a-false-alarm Ficksburg: The dorpie where revolution was a false alarm], by Kwanele Sosibo, ''Mail &amp; Guardian'', 23 December 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

A number of police officers were charged with Tatane's murder but they were found not guilty on the grounds that Tatane's murderers could not be identified as they were wearing helmets. However, a British journalist was easily able to identify his killers from video footage.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dailymaverick.co.za/article/2013-07-22-police-brutality-and-the-mass-amnesia-that-threatens-to-obscure-it/#.UeylJY3I2VI Police brutality, and the mass amnesia that threatens to obscure it], Inigo Gilmore, ''Daily Maverick'', 22 July 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9328">'''Backcasting''' is a planning method that starts with defining a desirable future and then works backwards to identify policies and programs that will connect that specified future to the present.&lt;ref&gt;Page 12. The Soft Path for Water in a Nutshell (2005). Oliver M Brandes and David B. Brooks. A joint publication of Friends of the Earth Canada and the [[POLIS Project on Ecological Governance]]. [[University of Victoria]], Victoria BC.&lt;/ref&gt; The fundamentals of the method were outlined by John B. Robinson from the [[University of Waterloo]] in 1990.&lt;ref name="Robinson 1990"&gt;Robinson, John B. 1990. Futures under glass: a recipe for people who hate to predict ''Futures'', vol. 22, issue 8, pp. 820–842.&lt;/ref&gt; The fundamental question of backcasting asks: "if we want to attain a certain goal, what actions must be taken to get there?"&lt;ref&gt;Tinker, J. 1996. From 'Introduction' ix-xv. Life in 2030: Exploring a Sustainable Future for Canada, edited by J.B. Robinson et al. Vancouver: University of British Columbia Press.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Page 5. Environmental Change and Challenge : A Canadian Perspective by Philip Dearden, Bruce Mitchell. {{ISBN|0-19-541014-9}} / 9780195410143 / 0-19-541014-9. Oxford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

While [[forecasting]] involves predicting the future based on current trend analysis, backcasting approaches the challenge of discussing the future from the opposite direction; it is "a method in which the future desired conditions are envisioned and steps are then defined to attain those conditions, rather than taking steps that are merely a continuation of present methods extrapolated into the future".&lt;ref&gt;Holmberg &amp; Robèrt (2000), p.294.&lt;/ref&gt;

In statistics and data analysis, backcasting can be considered to be the opposite of forecasting; thus:
* ''forecasting'' involves the prediction of the future (''unknown'') values of the [[Dependent and independent variables|dependent variables]] based on ''known'' values of the [[Dependent and independent variables|independent variable]].
* ''backcasting'' involves the prediction of the ''unknown'' values of the independent variables that '''''might''''' have existed, in order to explain the ''known'' values of the dependent variable.&lt;ref name="Stan Development Team"&gt;{{cite book |last=Stan Development Team |date=2014-07-20 |title=Stan Modeling Language: User's Guide and Reference Manual |url=http://mc-stan.org/manual.html |location=pg. 39 |publisher=Stan}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Backcasting vs. Forecasting ==
[[File:Backcasting.jpg|200px|thumb|right|Temporal representation of backcasting.&lt;ref&gt;Taken from Yeates, 2004, p.147.&lt;/ref&gt;]]
Backcasting, a term first coined by John Robinson in 1982,&lt;ref&gt;See Robinson (1982, 1988, 2003).&lt;/ref&gt; involves establishing the description of a very definite and very specific future situation. It then involves an imaginary moving backwards in time, step-by-step, in as many stages as are considered necessary, from the future to the present to reveal the mechanism through which that particular specified future could be attained from the present.&lt;ref&gt;Robinson's backcasting approach is very similar to the ''anticipatory scenarios'' of Ducot and Lubben (1980), and Bunn and Salo (1993).&lt;/ref&gt;

Backcasting is not concerned with predicting the future:
::The major distinguishing characteristic of backcasting analyses is the concern, not with likely energy futures, but with how desirable futures can be attained. It is thus explicitly [[normative]], involving "working backwards" from a particular future end-point to the present to determine what policy measures would be required to reach that future.&lt;ref&gt;Derborg (1996), p.814.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Jansen (1994, p.&amp;nbsp;503):
::Within the framework of technological development, “forecasting” concerns the extrapolation of developments towards the future and the exploration of achievements that can be realized through technology in the long term. Conversely, the reasoning behind “backcasting” is: on the basis of an interconnecting picture of demands technology must meet in the future — “sustainability criteria” — to direct and determine the process that technology development must take and possibly also the pace at which this development process must take effect.
::Backcasting [is] both an important aid in determining the direction technology development must take and in specifying the targets to be set for this purpose. As such, backcasting is an ideal search toward determining the nature and scope of the technological challenge posed by sustainable development, and it can thus serve to direct the search process toward new — sustainable — technology.

==Practical applications==
Backcasting is increasingly used in urban planning and resource management of water and energy. It was used by [[Peter Gleick]] and colleagues at the [[Pacific Institute]] in a 1995 study on California water policy, as an alternative to traditional California water planning approaches.&lt;ref&gt;Gleick, P.H., P. Loh, S.V. Gomez, J. Morrison. 1995. California Water 2020: A Sustainable Vision. Pacific Institute, Oakland, California (May 1995)&lt;/ref&gt; In 2006, the [[Capital Regional District]] Water Services, which services the greater [[Victoria, British Columbia|Victoria]] area in [[British Columbia]], [[Canada]], committed to backcasting to the year 2050 as a formal element of all future strategic water planning initiatives.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.crd.bc.ca/minutes/wateradvisorycommitt_/2006_/dec12/dec12.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

Backcasting is a key component of the [[soft energy path]], a concept developed by [[Amory Lovins]] after the shock of the [[1973 energy crisis]] in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;"Energy Strategy: The Road Not Taken?" published in Foreign Affairs, in October 1976&lt;/ref&gt;

Backcasting from Sustainability Principles, or [[System conditions of sustainability]] is a key concept of the '[[Strategic sustainable development|Framework for Strategic Sustainable Development]]' pioneered by [[Karl-Henrik Robèrt]], founder of [[The Natural Step]], an international nonprofit organization dedicated to applied research for sustainability, in cooperation with a global academic [http://www.alliance-ssd.org Alliance for Strategic Sustainable Development ] which links universities which cooperate with businesses, and other NGOs. It has been refined and tested by peer-review and application within businesses (widely known examples are: Interface, Nike, Whistler).

Backcasting is used in climate reconstruction or cosmology to determine the conditions (i.e., values of unknown independent variables) that existed in the distant past based on ''known'' (more accurately estimated) values of past dependent variables.&lt;ref name="Stan Development Team"/&gt;

'''Bamboo bicycles''' are [[Bicycle pedal|pedal-and-chain-driven]], [[Human-powered transport|human-powered]], [[single-track vehicle]]s that have two wheels attached to a bamboo frame. Because of its light weight, vibration damping, and sustainability, bamboo is slowly starting to be used in bicycle frame production, though the industry is still dominated by aluminium frames.

== History ==
Bamboo bikes were first patented in England by the Bamboo Cycle Company and introduced to the general public on 26 April 1894.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|title = Bamboo Cycle Company|url = http://www.bikebamboo.com/bamboo_cycle_co.php|website = BikeBamboo.com|accessdate = 2015-10-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; A US patent was applied for in 1895, by August Oberg and Andrew Gustafson, and granted in 1896. However, with the development of tougher industrial metals, such as steel and aluminium, large-scale usage of bamboo to build bicycles never happened.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|url = https://www.wpi.edu/Pubs/E-project/Available/E-project-042715-212811/unrestricted/MG_Bamboo_Bike_Final_4.28.pdf|title = Management of the Design and Construction of the WPI Bamboo Bicycle|last = Aleles|first = Nicholas|date = 27 April 2015|journal = Worcester Polytechnic Institute Major Qualifying Project|doi = |pmid = |access-date = 19 October 2015|last2 = Collins|first2 = Hayden|publisher = Worcester Polytechnic Institute|others = John Downey, Brodie Green, Amaia Gritsko, Angela Langford, Mitchell Lewis, Samuel Longwell, Lena Pafumi}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = The Railway News ...|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=GwY1AQAAIAAJ|date = 1895-01-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Though bicycles are a staple of human transportation, in both rural and urbanised areas, bamboo bicycles are not widely used. However, with the advent of the [[Green politics|Green movement]], bamboo is being used again, primarily for high-end racing and [[Track bicycle|touring bicycles]]. Bamboo bikes are entering the market as low cost alternatives to relatively expensive and unsustainable aluminium and metal bikes.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite web|title = Bamboo Bikes Initiative in Ghana - UN and Climate Change|url = https://www.un.org/climatechange/blog/2014/08/bamboo-bikes-initiative-ghana/|website = UN and Climate Change|accessdate = 2015-10-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Technical aspects ==
Several aspects of bamboo are extremely valuable to both cyclists and bicycle manufacturers: high strength-to-weight ratio, vibration control, and sustainable growth. Because of bamboo's tendency to grow straight, it does not exhibit "knots" and "turns" in its wood, unlike other types of wood. As a result, bamboo has a higher specific tensile strength than steel, as well as a higher specific compressive strength than concrete.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite web|title = The Bamboo Solution {{!}} DiscoverMagazine.com|url = http://discovermagazine.com/1996/jun/thebamboosolutio784|work= Discover Magazine|accessdate = 2015-10-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite journal|url = http://bambus.rwth-aachen.de/eng/PDF-Files/Mechanical%20properties%20of%20bamboo.pdf|title = Mechanical properties of bamboo|last = Rottke|first = Evelin|date = 27 October 2002|journal = RWTH Aachen University Publications|doi = |pmid = |access-date = 19 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; This tendency also allows for excellent vibration control, which, in turn, provides for a smoother ride and increased stability on rough terrain.

The bamboo poles can be joined in a number of different ways. The earliest models used metal joints which were then tightened around the bamboo. Another approach is to wrap the joints with resin saturated fibers to make composite lugs around the bamboo frame members. For modernised track bicycles, carbon fibre is used for the remainder of the parts that are not made of bamboo due to its light weight - for example, the fork, because it is difficult to find a perfect piece of bamboo that fits into the fork socket of the frame.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;

== Projects ==
Bamboo could be used as an alternative to traditional steel and aluminium bikes in many rural areas because of its potential sustainability. 

A "Bamboo Bike Project", started by engineers at [[Columbia University]], created a small number of bamboo bikes from 2007 to 2011. This was done with the intention of providing low cost bikes for Africans in rural areas, and stimulating local bike building industries, without major assistance from outside sources.&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://bamboobike.org/Home.html|title = Bamboo Bike Project|date = 2011|accessdate = 4 November 2015|website = Bamboo Bike Project|publisher = The Earth Institute at Columbia University|last = Mutter|first = John}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The United Nations and the United States have invested in the Ghana Bamboo Bike Initiative, which was created by Bernice Dapaah. This business markets itself as addressing climate change, poverty, youth unemployment, rural-urban migration and by creating jobs for women.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; As of 2015 over 1000 of these bikes had been sold in Ghana, Europe and the United States.&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;{{Cite web|title = Ghana’s bicycle which is creating jobs while it saves the soil|url = https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2015/may/05/ghana-environment-bamboo-bicycles-seed-award|website = the Guardian|accessdate = 2015-11-09|first = Corinne|last = Jones}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As of 2016 few bicycles have also been made in Bangladesh.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://youth.newagebd.net/2187/made-in-bangladesh-3/|title=Made in Bangladesh - New Age Youth|date=2016-02-28|work=New Age Youth|access-date=2018-03-07|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Cost ==
The most expensive bamboo bikes cost thousands of dollars. Conversely, the bikes sold in Ghana for the Ghana Bamboo Bike Initiative have been said to cost about $120, which is significantly more expensive than conventional bicycles.&lt;ref name=":7"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Bamboo bikes have benefits|url = http://www.sfgate.com/homeandgarden/article/Bamboo-bikes-have-benefits-3278264.php|website = SFGate|accessdate = 2015-11-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; The cheapest for adults retail at $350 as of 2018, thus the bikes are retailed specifically for the export market.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title =Products – Ghana Bamboo Bikes |url=http://ghanabamboobikes.org/shop/ |accessdate=30 October 2018&lt;/ref&gt;

This variation in cost has two main reasons: the relative wealth of the consumers to whom the bikes are marketed, and the difference in production quality. In the United States, all parts incorporated into the bike are high-end, similar to the parts used in expensive carbon fibre bikes. Modern machines are used to laminate, waterproof, and join the individual bamboo pieces. The Ghanaian bikes, on the other hand, source most parts (e.g. bamboo, chains, bolts, etc.) from low-cost sources.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;

'''Betamax''' (also called '''Beta''', as in its logo) is a consumer-level analog-recording and [[Videocassette#Cassette formats|cassette]] format of [[magnetic tape]] for [[video]].  It was developed by [[Sony]] and was released in [[Japan]] on May 10, 1975.&lt;ref name="McDonald2007"&gt;{{cite book|last=McDonald|first=Paul|title=Video and DVD Industries|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=G68TAQAAIAAJ|accessdate=6 June 2012|date=2007-08-06|publisher=British Film Institute|isbn=9781844571673|page=33}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first Betamax device introduced in the United States was the LV-1901 console, which included a {{convert|19|in|cm|adj=on}} color monitor, and appeared in stores in early November 1975. The cassettes contain {{convert|0.50|in|mm|1|adj=mid|-wide}} [[videotape]] in a design similar to that of the earlier, professional {{convert|0.75|in|mm|adj=mid|-wide}}, [[U-matic]] format.  Betamax is obsolete, having lost the [[videotape format war]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.pcmag.com/encyclopedia_term/0,2542,t=Betamax&amp;i=38569,00.asp |title=Betamax |publisher=Pcmag.com |date=1994-12-01 |accessdate=2012-09-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; to [[VHS]].  Production of Betamax recorders ceased in 2002; new Betamax cassettes were available until March 2016, when Sony stopped making and selling them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Beta Video Cassette and Micro MV Cassette Tape End of Shipment Announcement|url=http://www.sony.co.jp/SonyInfo/News/Press/201511/15-1110/index.html|website=Sony Japan|publisher=Sony|accessdate=10 November 2015|date=10 November 2015|quote="In March 2016, Sony will end shipment of the Beta video cassette and micro cassette MV."}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Like the rival videotape format VHS (introduced in Japan by JVC in October 1976&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.totalrewind.org/vhs/H_3300.htm] JVC HR-3300 release.&lt;/ref&gt; and in the United States by RCA in August 1977),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cedmagic.com/history/vbt200.html |title=CED in the History of Media Technology |publisher=Cedmagic.com |date=1977-08-23 |accessdate=2012-09-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; Betamax has no [[Guard band#Recording|guard band]] and uses [[azimuth recording]] to reduce [[Crosstalk (electronics)|crosstalk]]. According to Sony's history webpages, the name had a double meaning: ''beta'' is the Japanese word used to describe the way in which signals are recorded on the tape; and the shape of the lowercase Greek letter [[Beta (letter)|beta]] (β) resembles the course of the tape through the transport. The suffix ''-max'', from the word "maximum", was added to suggest greatness.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20021017222845/http://www.sony.net/Fun/SH/1-13/h5.html "This is a revolution!"] Archive of Sony.net history&lt;/ref&gt;
In 1977, Sony issued the first long-play Betamax VCR, the SL-8200. This VCR had two recording speeds: normal, and the newer half speed. This provided two hours' recording on
the L-500 Beta videocassette. The SL-8200 was to compete against the VHS VCRs, which allowed up to 4, and later 6 and 8, hours of recording on one cassette.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rewindmuseum.com/betamax.htm |title=1975 – The Sony SL-8200 long play VCR |publisher=Rewindmuseum.com |date= |accessdate=2012-09-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Sanyo]] marketed a version as ''Betacord'', which also was casually called "Beta". In addition to Sony and Sanyo, Beta-format video recorders were manufactured and sold by [[Toshiba]], [[Pioneer Corporation|Pioneer]], [[Murphy Radio|Murphy]], [[Aiwa]], and [[NEC Corporation|NEC]].  The [[Zenith Electronics Corporation]] and [[WEGA]] Corporations contracted with [[Sony]] to produce VCRs for their product lines.  The department stores [[Sears]] (in the United States and Canada) and [[Quelle (company)|Quelle]] (in Germany) sold Beta-format VCRs under their house brands, as did the [[RadioShack]] chain of electronic stores. Betamax and VHS competed in a fierce [[Videotape format war|format war]], which saw VHS win in most markets.&lt;ref name="owen"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mediacollege.com/video/format/compare/betamax-vhs.html |title=The Betamax vs VHS Format War| author= Dave Owen| date= 2005 |publisher=Mediacollege.com |format= video|accessdate=2012-09-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Home and professional recording==
One other major consequence of the Betamax technology's introduction to the U.S. was the lawsuit ''[[Sony Corp. v. Universal City Studios]]'' (1984, the "Betamax case"), with the [[Supreme Court of the United States|U.S. Supreme Court]] determining home videotaping to be legal in the United States, wherein home videotape cassette recorders were a legal technology since they had substantial noninfringing uses. This precedent was later invoked in ''[[MGM v. Grokster]]'' (2005), where the high court agreed that the same "substantial noninfringing uses" standard applies to authors and vendors of [[peer-to-peer]] file sharing software (notably excepting those who "actively induce" copyright infringement through "purposeful, culpable expression and conduct").&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.museum.tv/eotvsection.php?entrycode=betamaxcase |title= BETAMAX CASE |publisher=Museum.tv |date= |accessdate=2012-09-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Harris, Paul.

For the professional and broadcast video industry, Sony derived [[Betacam]] from Betamax. Released in 1982, Betacam became the most widely used videotape format in [[Electronic News Gathering|ENG]] (electronic news gathering), replacing the {{convert|.75|in|mm|abbr=on}} wide [[U-matic]] tape format. Betacam and Betamax are similar in some ways: they use the same videocassette shape, use the same oxide tape formulation with the same [[coercivity]], and record linear audio tracks in the same location of the tape. But in the key area of video recording, Betacam and Betamax are completely different. (For details, see the [[Betacam]] article.)

Sony also offered a range of industrial Betamax products, a Beta I-only format for industrial and institutional users. These were aimed at the same market as [[U-Matic]] equipment, but were cheaper and smaller. The arrival of Betacam reduced the demand for both industrial Beta and U-Matic equipment.
&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3NFAbjYD8MkC&amp;pg=PA38&amp;lpg=PA38&amp;dq=Betamax+Betamax+is+a+color-under+system&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=o2DvhcNqaN&amp;sig=ExW4ZhmE6e-3u_Ueq7pTd3_Gke8&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=vywrT-2ILYvKrAex9djIDA&amp;ved=0CFgQ6AEwCA#v=onepage&amp;q=Betamax%20Betamax%20is%20a%20color-under%20system&amp;f=false |title=The filmmaker's handbook: a comprehensive guide for the digital age |author = Steven Ascher, Edward Pincus|page= 38 |publisher=Books.google.com |date= |accessdate=2012-09-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Betamax also had a significant part to play in the music recording industry, when Sony introduced its [[Pulse-code modulation|PCM]] (Pulse Code Modulation) digital recording system as an encoding box/[[PCM adaptor]] that connected to a Betamax recorder. The Sony PCM-F1 adaptor was sold with a companion Betamax VCR SL-2000 as a portable [[digital audio]] recording system. Many recording engineers used this system in the 1980s and 1990s to make their first [[digital master]] recordings.

Initially, Sony was able to tout several Betamax-only features, such as BetaScan—a high speed picture search in either direction—and BetaSkipScan, a technique that allowed the operator to see where he was on the tape by pressing the FF key (or REW, if in that mode): the transport would switch into the BetaScan mode until the key was released. This feature is discussed in more detail on [[Peep Search]]. Sony believed that the M-Load transports used by VHS machines made copying these trick modes impossible. BetaSkipScan (Peep Search) is now available on miniature M-load formats, but even Sony was unable to fully replicate this on VHS. BetaScan was originally called "Videola" until the company that made the [[Moviola]] threatened legal action.

Sony would also sell a BetaPak, a small deck designed to be used with a camera. Concerned with the need for several pieces and cables to connect them, an integrated camera/recorder was designed, which Sony dubbed a "Camcorder"; the result was Betamovie. Betamovie used the standard-size cassette, but with a modified transport. The tape was wrapped 300[[Degree (angle)|°]] around a smaller, {{convert|44.671|mm|in|4|abbr=on}}-diameter head drum, with a single dual-azimuth head to write the video tracks. For playback, the tape would be inserted into a Beta-format deck. Due to the different geometry and writing techniques employed, playback within the camcorder was not feasible. SuperBeta and industrial Betamovie camcorders would also be sold by Sony.

===HiFi audio upgrade===
In June 1983, Sony introduced high fidelity audio to videotape as Beta Hi-Fi. For [[NTSC]], Beta HiFi worked by placing a pair of FM [[Carrier wave|carriers]] between the chroma (C) and luminance (Y) carriers, a process known as frequency multiplexing. Each head had a specific pair of carriers; in total, four individual channels were employed. Head A recorded its hi-fi carriers at 1.38(L) and 1.68(R) MHz, and the B head employed 1.53 and 1.83&amp;nbsp;MHz. The result was audio with an 80&amp;nbsp;dB dynamic range, with less than 0.005% [[wow (recording)|wow]] and [[flutter (electronics and communication)|flutter]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.betainfoguide.net/BetaBetter.html |title=Why Beta is Better |publisher=Betainfoguide.net |date= |accessdate=2012-09-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Prior to the introduction of Beta Hi-Fi, Sony shifted the Y carrier up by 400&amp;nbsp;kHz to make room for the four FM carriers that would be needed for Beta Hi-Fi. All Beta machines incorporated this change, plus the ability to hunt for a lower frequency pre-AFM Y carrier. Sony incorporated an "antihunt" circuit, to stop the machine hunting for a Y carrier that wasn't there.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.palsite.com/format.html |title=Betamax the Better Format |publisher=Palsite.com |date= |accessdate=2012-09-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some Sony NTSC models were marketed as "Hi-Fi Ready" (with an SL-HFR prefix to the model's number instead of the usual SL or SL-HF). These Betamax decks looked like a regular Betamax model, except for a special 28-pin connector on the rear. If the user desired a Beta Hi-Fi model but lacked the funds at the time, he could purchase an "SL-HFRxx" and at a later date purchase the separate Hi-Fi Processor. Sony offered two outboard Beta Hi-Fi processors, the HFP-100 and HFP-200. They were identical except that the HFP-200 was capable of multi-channel TV sound, with the word "stereocast" printed after the Beta Hi-Fi logo. This was possible because unlike a VHS Hi-Fi deck, an NTSC Betamax didn't need an extra pair of heads. The HFP-x00 would generate the needed carriers which would be recorded by the attached deck, and during playback the AFM carriers would be passed to the HFP-x00. They also had a small "fine tracking" control on the rear panel for difficult tapes.

For [[PAL]], however, the bandwidth between the chroma and luminance carriers was not sufficient to allow additional FM carriers, so depth multiplexing was employed, wherein the audio track would be recorded in the same way that the video track was. The lower-frequency audio track was written first by a dedicated head, and the video track recorded on top by the video head. The head disk had an extra pair of audio-only heads with a different azimuth, positioned slightly ahead of the regular video heads, for this purpose.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.palsite.com/slospec.html |title=Sony SLO-1700 specs |publisher=Palsite.com |date= |accessdate=2012-09-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sony was confident that VHS could not achieve the same audio performance feat as Beta Hi-Fi. However, to the chagrin of Sony, JVC did develop a VHS hi-fi system on the principle of depth multiplexing approximately a year after the first Beta Hi-Fi VCR, the SL-5200, was introduced by Sony. Despite initial praise as providing "CD sound quality", both Beta Hi-Fi and VHS HiFi suffered from "carrier buzz", where high frequency information bled into the audio carriers, creating momentary "buzzing" and other audio flaws. Both systems also used [[compander|companding]] noise-reduction systems, which could create "pumping" artifacts under some conditions. Both formats also suffered from interchange problems, where tapes made on one machine did not always play back well on other machines. When this happened and if the artifacts became too distracting, users were forced to revert to the old linear soundtrack.

===New standards: SuperBetamax and Extended Definition Betamax===
In early 1985, Sony would introduce a new feature, High Band or SuperBeta, by again shifting the Y carrier—this time by 800&amp;nbsp;kHz. This improved the bandwidth available to the Y sideband and increased the horizontal resolution from 240 to 290&amp;nbsp;lines on a regular-grade Betamax cassette. Since over-the-antenna and cable signals were only 300–330 lines resolution, SuperBeta could make a nearly identical copy of live television. However, the chroma resolution still remained relatively poor, limited to just under 0.4&amp;nbsp;MHz or approximately 30&amp;nbsp;lines resolution, whereas live broadcast [[chrominance]] resolution was over 100&amp;nbsp;lines. The heads were also narrowed to 29&amp;nbsp;[[Micrometre|μm]] to reduce crosstalk, with a narrower head gap to play back the higher carrier frequency at 5.6&amp;nbsp;MHz. Later, some models would feature further improvement, in the form of Beta-Is, a high band version of the Beta-I recording mode. There were some incompatibilities between the older Beta decks and SuperBeta, but most could play back a high band tape without major problems. SuperBeta decks had a switch to disable the SuperBeta mode for compatibility purposes. (SuperBeta was only marginally supported outside of Sony, as many licensees had already discontinued their Betamax line.)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CT6UlAvKz88 |title=Sony SuperBetamax demo tape on youtube |publisher=Youtube.com |date=2010-09-03 |accessdate=2012-09-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.betamaxcollectors.com/sonysuperbetamaxmodelsl-hf600.html |title=Sony Super Betamax Model SL-HF600 |publisher=Betamaxcollectors.com |date= |accessdate=2012-09-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1988, Sony would again push the envelope with ED Beta, or "Extended Definition" Betamax, capable of up to 500 lines of resolution, that equaled DVD quality (480 typical). In order to store the ~6.5&amp;nbsp;MHz-wide luma signal, with the peak frequency at 9.3&amp;nbsp;MHz, Sony used a metal formulation tape borrowed from the Betacam SP format (branded "ED-Metal") and incorporated some improvements to the transport to reduce mechanically induced aberrations in the picture. Beta ED also featured a luminance carrier deviation of 2.5&amp;nbsp;MHz, as opposed to the 1.2&amp;nbsp;MHz used in SuperBeta, improving contrast with reduced luminance noise.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.palsite.com/tapes.html |title=tapes Extended Definition" Betamax |publisher=Palsite.com |date= |accessdate=2012-09-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sony introduced two ED decks and a camcorder in the late 1980s. The top end EDV-9500 (EDV-9300 in Canada) deck was a very capable editing deck, rivaling much more expensive U-Matic set-ups for its accuracy and features, but did not have commercial success due to lack of timecode and other pro features. Sony did market Beta ED to "semiprofessional" users, or "[[prosumers]]". One complaint about the EDC-55 ED CAM was that it needed a lot of light (at least 25&amp;nbsp;lux), due to the use of two CCDs instead of the typical single-CCD imaging device. The Beta ED lineup only recorded in BII/BIII modes, with the ability to play back BI/BIs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://joeclark.org/beta/BetterBetaList.html |title=Beta by Sony list |publisher=Joeclark.org |date=2004-12-26 |accessdate=2012-09-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite the sharp decline in sales of Betamax recorders in the late 1980s and subsequent halt in production of new recorders by Sony in 2002, Betamax, SuperBetamax and EDBeta are still being used by a small number of people. Even though Sony stopped making new cassettes in 2016, new cassettes are still available for purchase at [[online shop]]s and used recorders are often found at [[flea market]]s, thrift stores or on [[Internet]] [[auction]] sites. Early format [[BetaCam]] cassettes—which are physically based on the Betamax cassette—continue to be available for use in the professional media.

The somewhat unintuitive analog resolution loss for 16:9 DVD compared to 4:3 DVD arises from the fact that analog resolution unit is "lines per picture height". When picture height is kept the same, the same 720 pixels are spread to a wider area in 16:9, hence lower horizontal resolution per picture height.

=== Tape lengths ===
Both [[Multi-standard television|NTSC and PAL/SECAM]] Betamax cassettes are physically identical (although the signals recorded on the tape are incompatible). However, as tape speeds differ between NTSC and PAL/SECAM, the playing time for any given cassette will vary accordingly between the systems. Other unusual lengths were produced from time to time, such as L-410.

* For NTSC only, BI is standard speed, BII is 1/2 speed, BIII is 1/3 speed

==Home movies==
{{Main article|Betamovie}}
Two-piece camera/VCR systems rapidly displaced [[Super 8 mm film]] as the medium of choice for shooting home movies and amateur films. These units included a portable VCR, which the videographer would carry by a shoulder strap, and a separate camera, which was connected to the VCR by a special cable. At this point, Beta had several advantages over VHS systems. The smaller Beta cassette made for smaller and lighter VCRs.

However, consumers wanted a one-piece solution. The first one-piece consumer camcorder, the Betamovie, came from Sony. A major requirement for a one-piece camcorder was miniaturizing the recording head drum, and Sony's solution to this involved a nonstandard video signal which would become standard only when played back on full-sized VCRs. A side effect of this was that Beta camcorders were record-only: consumers saw this as a major limitation.

VHS manufacturers found a better solution to drum miniaturization (it involved four heads doing the work of two). Because it used standard video signals, VHS camcorders could review footage in the camcorder and copy to another VCR for editing. This shifted the home movie advantage dramatically away from Beta, and was a primary reason for the loss of Beta market share: owners of Beta VCRs found that a VHS camcorder would allow them to copy and edit footage to their Beta deck – something that Betamovie could not do. If rental movies were not available in Beta, they could rent them in VHS and use their camcorder to play them. Owners of VHS VCRs could also choose a variant camcorder format called [[VHS-C]]. This used a miniaturized cassette to make a camcorder smaller and lighter than any Betamovie.

Sony could not duplicate the functionality of VHS-C camcorders, and seeing the rapid loss of market share, eventually introduced the [[Video8]] format. Their hope was that Video8 could replace both Beta and VHS for all uses. For more information, see the article on [[camcorders]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120507051842/http://www.floridahomemovies.com/wp/?page_id=185|archivedate=2017-05-07|url=http://www.floridahomemovies.com/wp/?page_id=185 |title=BetaMax history |publisher=Floridahomemovies.com|accessdate=2012-09-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==End of production==
On November 10, 2015, Sony announced that it would no longer be producing Betamax video cassettes.&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-34776424 |title=Sony says goodbye to Betamax tapes|publisher=BBC News|date=2015-11-10|accessdate=2015-11-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; Production and sales ended March 2016 after nearly 41 years of continuous production. Third party manufacturers continue to make new cassettes. While these cassettes are designed for use with the Betacam format, the cassettes are interchangeable with traditional Betamax systems.

==Legacy==
{{For|reasons Betamax lost to VHS|Videotape format war}}

The VHS format's defeat of the Betamax format became a classic [[marketing]] case study. Sony's attempt to dictate an industry standard backfired when [[JVC]] made the tactical decision to forgo Sony's offer of Betamax in favor of developing its own technology. JVC felt that accepting Sony's offer would yield results similar to the [[U-Matic]] deal, with Sony dominating.&lt;ref name="howells"&gt;John Howells. "The Management of Innovation and Technology: The Shaping of Technology and Institutions of the Market Economy" [hardcopy], pg 76–81&lt;/ref&gt;

By 1980, JVC's VHS format controlled 60% of the North American market.&lt;ref name="stern"&gt;{{cite web

|accessdate=2014-01-13
|page=4}}&lt;/ref&gt; The large [[economy of scale]] allowed VHS units to be introduced to the European market at a far lower cost than the rarer Betamax units. In the United Kingdom, Betamax held a 25% market share in 1981, but by 1986, it was down to 7.5% and continued to decline further. By 1984, 40 companies made VHS format equipment in comparison with Beta's 12. Sony finally conceded defeat in 1988 when it, too, began producing VHS recorders (early models were made by [[Hitachi]]), though it still continued to produce Betamax recorders until 2002.&lt;ref name="owen"/&gt;&lt;ref name="scrapheap"&gt;{{cite news|title=Sony Finally Throws the Betamax on Scrapheap|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2002/aug/28/business/fi-beta28|work=[[Los Angeles Times]]|date=August 28, 2002|accessdate=2012-09-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Japan, Betamax had more success and eventually evolved into Extended Definition Betamax, with 500+ lines of resolution.

'''''Blood in the Face''''' is a 1991 [[documentary film]] about [[white supremacy]] groups in North America. It was directed by Anne Bohlen, [[Kevin Rafferty]] and [[James Ridgeway]]. It features many interviews with various white supremacist leaders, and archival footage of others.

==Production details==
''Blood in the Face'' was inspired by a nonfiction book by author James Ridgeway, who is also credited as one of the film's directors. This documentary was largely shot in [[Cohoctah Township, Michigan]]. It focuses on a gathering of [[neo-Nazi]]s, [[racist]]s, and [[conspiracy theorist]]s who expect [[people of color]] to ignite a [[Racial Holy War]] in the U.S.

Filmmakers Anne Bohlen and Kevin Rafferty take an intentionally leisurely, conversational tack with supremacists who have assembled for lectures and workshops on everything from getting their message out via home videos to moving all like-minded "[[Christian Identity|white Christians]]" to the Northwest, especially the [[Idaho Panhandle]].

According to the audio commentary on the [[Roger &amp; Me]] DVD, [[Academy Award]]-winning American filmmaker [[Michael Moore]] appears as an off-screen interviewer because he was originally contacted to arrange a meeting between the filmmakers and the supremacists since he had previously interviewed them for a magazine.  At the last minute, the filmmakers backed out of the interview and Moore stepped in to conduct it.  Moore is thanked in the end credits.

Michael Moore does appear on camera during one interview, and can be heard during another interview.

'''Boris Smirnoff''' (1903 - 2007) was a [[France|Franco]]-[[Russia]]n [[Cubism|cubist]], [[Avant-gardism|avant-gardist]] and [[analytical art]] [[Painting|painter]].

Boris Smirnoff was born  in [[Russian Empire|Russia]]. He had two brothers - Alexander and Vladimir. He was the youngest son. Vladimir was known as the artist-[[amateur]] and the [[Futurism|futurist]], big admirer of [[David Burliuk]] and [[Vasily Kamensky]].

His family escaped to France in 1917 after the [[October Revolution]] in [[Russia]]. Boris behind them, and stayed in [[Petrograd]]. He is learning as artist and works in [[Vsevolod Meyerhold|Meyerhold]] Theatre.

In 1926 Boris has found the new idol - [[Pavel Filonov]] with new "[[Analytical art|Analytical Art]]".

In 1927 Boris Smirnoff has appeared in France. He worked as a painter in France. Over the next decade, he drew a lot of [[oil painting]]s and [[pastel]]s.

All this oils and pastels were burned by the German invaders as "[[degenerate art]]" during the [[Second World War]].

Because of this Boris Smirnoff began to draw exclusively [[watercolour]] on paper after the war. He said: "I can always put these watercolours into a suitcase and to carry away with myself!"

Boris Smirnoff refused to sell his [[Work of art|artworks]] like his teacher Pavel Filonov.

After the [[Second World War]] Boris Smirnoff had lived in [[UK|Great Britain]] and [[Lisbon]], [[Portugal]], in [[Malaysia]] and [[Singapore]], in [[Switzerland]] and the [[Netherlands]].

Many years later, Boris returned to Russia and saw that it was a different country. This was not the Russia, from which he left. And, even though the country largely did not like him, he remained there until his death.

Until his death, he did not sell his watercolours. He said: "One hundred and four years - this is not a reason to change my habits".

Boris Smirnoff died in Russia in 2007 at the age of 104. After his death the Boris Smirnoff Foundation was organised to manage his collection. Today, one of the key locations the public can see his art is at the [[The Vineyard Hotel|Vineyard Hotel]], [[Newbury, Berkshire|Newbury]], [[Berkshire]], England.

'''Burak Arıkan''' (born in 1976, Istanbul) is a Turkish contemporary artist working with complex networks raising questions about economic, political, societal issues. His work is research-based, thus generates data and inputs into custom abstract machinery, builds network maps, results in performances, and procreates predictions to make inherent power relationships visible, thus discussable.

Arikan is the founder of Graph Commons, a platform for mapping, analyzing, and publishing data-networks. Graph Commons workshop for artists,&lt;ref&gt;http://teaching.burak-arikan.com/creative-networking/ Creative Networking Workshops&lt;/ref&gt; activists, critical researchers, and civil society organizations are being conducted internationally.&lt;ref&gt;http://civilsocietydialogue.blogspot.com NGO Network Mapping Workshops&lt;/ref&gt;

One of Arikan's works MyPocket (2008)&lt;ref&gt;http://www.turbulence.org/Works/mypocket/ MYPOCKET (2008)&lt;/ref&gt; is a live software system that predicts what the artist buys every day and discloses his spending records to the world. MyPocket was shown in Neuberger Museum of Art New York, Künstlerhaus Bethanien Berlin, and Media Space / FilmWinter Stuttgart, and most recently in the New Observatory exhibition in FACT Liverpool.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.fact.co.uk/projects/the-new-observatory/burak-arikan-ustr.aspx&lt;/ref&gt;

Arikan is an adjunct faculty in [[Interactive Telecommunications Program]], Tisch School of Arts, [[New York University]].&lt;ref&gt;http://itp.nyu.edu/itp/people/people.php?id=2416&amp;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://itp.nyu.edu/varwiki/Syllabus/Creative-Networking-F08 Creative Networking, ITP, NYU Fall 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

Arikan completed his master's degree at the [[MIT Media Lab]] in [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]] in the [[Physical Language Workshop]] led by [[John Maeda]].

Arikan is a member of [[Alternative informatics association|Alternative Informatics Association]], a civil society organization in Turkey focusing on the issues of Internet freedom and digital rights.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3937">A '''Carthaginian peace''' is the imposition of a very brutal "peace" achieved by completely crushing the enemy. The term derives from the peace imposed on [[Ancient Carthage|Carthage]] by [[Ancient Rome|Rome]]. After the [[Second Punic War]], Carthage lost all its colonies, was forced to demilitarize and pay a constant tribute to Rome and could enter war only with Rome's permission. At the end of the [[Third Punic War]], the Romans systematically burned Carthage to the ground and enslaved its population.

==Origin==
The term refers to the outcome of a series of wars between Rome and the [[Phoenicia]]n city of Carthage, known as the [[Punic Wars]]. The two empires fought three separate wars against each other, beginning in 264 BC and ending in 146 BC.

At the end of the [[Third Punic War]], the Romans laid siege to [[Carthage]]. When they took the city, they killed most of the inhabitants, sold the rest into [[slavery]], and destroyed the entire city. There is no ancient evidence for modern accounts that the Romans [[salting the earth|sowed the ground with salt]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Ridley|first1=R.T.|title=To Be Taken with a Pinch of Salt: The Destruction of Carthage|journal=Classical Philology|volume=81|issue=2|pages=140|year=1986|jstor=269786|doi=10.1086/366973 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

By extension, a Carthaginian peace can refer to any brutal peace treaty demanding total subjugation of the defeated side.

==Modern use==
Modern use of the term is often extended to any peace settlement in which the peace terms are overly harsh and designed to accentuate and perpetuate the inferiority of the loser. Thus, after [[World War I]], many (the economist [[John Maynard Keynes]] among them&lt;ref&gt;Keynes, John Maynard. ''The Economic Consequences of the Peace''. New York: Harcourt, Brace and Howe, 1920.&lt;/ref&gt;) described the [[Treaty of Versailles]] as a "Carthaginian Peace."

The [[Morgenthau Plan]] put forward after [[World War II]] has also been described as a Carthaginian peace, as it advocated the deindustrialization of Germany. It was intended to severely curb the influence of German power in the region and to prevent its remilitarization, as had occurred after World War I ([[Remilitarization of the Rhineland]]).  The Morgenthau Plan was dropped in favor of the [[Marshall Plan]] (1948–1952), which entailed the rebuilding of Western European infrastructure, particularly in West Germany. 

General [[Lucius D. Clay]], a deputy to general [[Dwight D. Eisenhower]] and, in 1945, [[Military Governor of the U.S. Occupation Zone in Germany]], would later remark that "there was no doubt that [[JCS 1067]] contemplated the Carthaginian peace which dominated our operations in Germany during the early months of occupation. This is while the US was following the Morgenthau Plan."&lt;ref&gt;A Nation at War in an Era of Strategic Change, p.129 ([https://books.google.com/books?id=3l7U7Mgmy80C&amp;pg=PA129&amp;lpg=PA129&amp;dq=there+was+no+doubt+that+JCS+1067+contemplated+the+Carthaginian+peace+which+dominated+our+operations+in+Germany+during+the+early+months+of+occupation&amp;source=web&amp;ots=0DA1V0w7WA&amp;sig=dSd7upp-P4OlW28bBQKnsKXbBxk&amp;hl=it&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;resnum=6&amp;ct=result#PPA129,M1 Google Books])&lt;/ref&gt; Clay would later replace Eisenhower as governor and as commander-in-chief in Europe. The Marshall Plan was favored as a revival of the West German economy was considered to be necessary for the recovery of the economy of Europe. West Germany was regarded as a key bulwark against the Eastern Bloc.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3239">In [[geometry]], a '''centroidal Voronoi tessellation (CVT)''' is a special type of Voronoi tessellation or [[Voronoi diagram]].  A Voronoi tessellation is called centroidal when the generating point of each Voronoi cell is also its mean (center of mass).  It can be viewed as an optimal partition corresponding to an optimal distribution of generators. A number of algorithms can be used to generate centroidal Voronoi tessellations, including [[Lloyd's algorithm]] for [[K-means clustering]].

Gersho's conjecture, proven for one and two dimensions, says that "asymptotically speaking, all cells of the optimal CVT, while forming a [[tessellation]], are [[Congruence (geometry)|congruent]] to a basic cell which depends on the dimension."&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|first1=Qiang|last1=Du|first2=Desheng|last2=Wang|title=The Optimal Centroidal Voronoi Tessellations and the Gersho's Conjecture in the Three-Dimensional Space|journal=Computers and Mathematics with Applications|issue=49|year=2005|pages=1355–1373}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In two dimensions, the basic cell for the optimal CVT is a regular [[hexagon]].

Centroidal Voronoi tessellations are useful in [[data compression]], optimal [[Numerical integration|quadrature]], optimal [[Quantization (signal processing)|quantization]], [[Data clustering|clustering]], and optimal mesh generation.&lt;ref name="Du_2"&gt;{{citation|first1=Qiang|last1=Du|first2=Vance|last2=Faber|author2-link=Vance Faber|first3=Max|last3=Gunzburger|title=Centroidal Voronoi Tessellations: Applications and Algorithms|doi=10.1137/S0036144599352836|journal=SIAM Review|volume=41|issue=4|pages=637–676|year=1999|citeseerx=10.1.1.452.2448}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Many [[patterns in nature|patterns seen in nature]] are closely approximated by a Centroidal Voronoi tessellation. Examples of this include the [[Giant's Causeway]], the cells of the [[cornea]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Pigatto | first1 = João Antonio Tadeu | display-authors = etal   | year = 2009 | title = Scanning electron microscopy of the corneal endothelium of ostrich | url = | journal = Cienc.

A weighted centroidal Voronoi diagrams is a CVT in which each centroid is weighted according to a certain function. For example, a [[grayscale]] image can be used as a density function to weight the points of a CVT, as a way to create digital [[stippling]].&lt;ref&gt;Secord, Adrian. "Weighted voronoi stippling." Proceedings of the 2nd international symposium on Non-photorealistic animation and rendering. ACM, 2002.&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''chain of events''' is a number of [[Action theory (philosophy)|actions]] and their effects that are [[Contiguity (probability theory)|contiguous]] and linked together that results in a particular outcome. In the [[physical science]]s, [[chain reaction]]s are a primary example. 

==Determinism==
{{Main|Determinism}}
''Determinism'' is the [[philosophy|philosophical]] [[proposition]] that every event, including human cognition and behaviour, decision and action, is [[causality|causally]] determined by an unbroken ''chain of events''.&lt;ref&gt;Van Inwagen, Peter, 1983, ''An Essay on Free Will'', Oxford: Clarendon Press.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt; With numerous historical debates, many varieties and philosophical positions on the subject of determinism exist from traditions throughout the world.

==In value theory==
In [[value theory]], it is the amount of cause and effects of the chain of events before generating [[intrinsic value (ethics)|intrinsic value]] that separates [[Instrumental value#High and low grades|high and low grades of instrumental value]]. The ''chain of events duration'' is the time it takes to reach the terminal event. In value theory this is generally the intrinsic value (also called terminal value). It is contrasted with [[ethic value duration]], which is the time that an object has any [[value intensity]].

==Fabric of events==
A ''fabric of events'' is an expansion of the ''chain of events'', emphasizing that chains of events are intertwined with each other, as a [[Textile|fabric]].{{CN|date=April 2014}}

==In accident analysis==

'''Democratized transactional giving''' is a form of corporate philanthropy and the latest evolution in [[cause marketing]], (defined as when for-profit companies join forces with nonprofits to promote a cause) where consumers, and not the brand in question, have maximum control over the causes they choose to support. Augmenting traditional corporate philanthropy and participatory cause marketing, democratized transactional giving empowers consumers to become better brand and cause advocates while promoting a strong behavioral influence that seeks to yield greater loyalty and brand commitment.

Successful democratized transactional giving is the outgrowth or result of a fully realized [[cause-related loyalty marketing]] campaign which not only links [[nonprofits]] and for-profits together, but does so in the context of an existing company’s [[loyalty program]]. The result is that consumers can convert any unused rewards issued by the company in the form of points, miles or other units to causes and nonprofits of their own choosing.

== Difference from traditional corporate philanthropy ==
According to KULA Causes, Inc., of Boulder, Colorado, which in 2010 designed and launched the Cause-Related Loyalty Marketing (CLM) software solution for companies looking to improve their loyalty and philanthropic efforts, corporate philanthropy/cause marketing has evolved in three phases.

Phase one was an autocratic approach where the brand selected the cause in question, the brand told the “cause story,” and the result was low customer behavioral influence. Phase two witnessed the growth of participatory cause marketing. Under this improvement, the brand still selects a number of causes (and tells the cause story) while customers choose causes from among that limited selection. The result is growing customer behavioral influence. In democratized transactional giving decisions and brand advocacy responsibility has been passed on to the consumer – a level of control that inspires a strong behavioral influence.

== Benefits for companies ==

When companies allow customers to donate unused rewards to causes of the customer’s choosing, the customer develops a greater appreciation for the company. [[Edelman]] PR found in its 2012 Goodpurpose Study that "72% of consumers would recommend a brand that supports a good cause over one that doesn’t, a 39% increase since 2008."&lt;ref&gt;Allison Goldberg, "Introducing: Goodpurpose 2012", Purpose. Edelman.com, April 25, 2102&lt;/ref&gt; By facilitating democratized transactional giving, companies can see that benefit as deepened customer loyalty.

== Benefits for consumers ==

Humans’ hard-wired capacity for [[empathy]] fuels the desire to help those in need, because people can imagine themselves in the same situation.&lt;ref&gt;Ray B. Williams, "Are We Entering the Age of Empathy?", Psychology Today, October 25, 2009&lt;/ref&gt; Consumers who act on this impulse benefit from the positive feelings associated with spending money on a good cause.&lt;ref&gt;Elizabeth W. Dunn, Daniel T. Gilbert and Timothy D. Wilson, 2011, "If money doesn't make you happy, then you probably aren't spending it right", ''Journal of Consumer Psychology'' 21, 117-118&lt;/ref&gt;

== Benefits for nonprofits ==

Nonprofits as a whole benefit when consumers rather than companies dictate where donations, including donations of unredeemed loyalty-program rewards, will go. This is because increasing numbers of consumers participating in democratized transactional giving also mean a wider diversity of nonprofits being helped according to each individual consumer’s cause affinities – the types of causes they tend to support.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1932">A '''deposit-refund system''' (DRS), also known as '''deposit-return system''', '''advance deposit fee''' or '''deposit-return scheme''', is a surcharge on a product when purchased and a rebate when it is returned. A well-known example is when [[container deposit legislation]] mandates that a refund is given when [[reusable packaging]] is returned. Deposit-refund system are a [[Market-based environmental policy instruments|market-based instrument]] to address [[Externality|externalities]]. As with [[Pigovian tax]]es a DRS aims to limit pollution of various types by creating an incentive to return a product.&lt;ref name = Walls&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rff.org/RFF/Documents/RFF-DP-11-47.pdf|title=Deposit-Refund Systems in Practice and Theory |last=Walls |first=Margaret |date=November 2011 |work=RFF DP 11-47 |publisher=Resources for the Future |accessdate=22 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

While most commonly used with beverage containers it can be used on other materials including liquid and gaseous wastes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Fullerton |first=Don |first2=Ann |last2=Wolverton |title=Two Generalizations of a Deposit-Refund System |journal=[[American Economic Review]] |year=2000 |volume=90 |issue=2 |pages=238–242 |doi=10.1257/aer.90.2.238 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Deposit-refund systems are used on products such as batteries, tyres, [[Automotive oil recycling|automotive oil]], [[consumer electronics]] and shipping [[pallet]]s.

There are three potential advantages of a DRS: it reduces illegal dumping by giving a financial incentive, it makes monitoring and enforcement easier, and evading the costs is difficult.&lt;ref name = Walls/&gt;

Deposit-refund systems can be both voluntary or mandated by legislation.

[[File:Johann Wolfgang Döbereiner.jpg|thumb|[[Johann Wolfgang Dobereiner]], who attempted to sort the elements in an order which consisted of triads.]]
In the [[history of the periodic table]], '''Dobereiner's triads''' were an early attempt to sort the elements into some logical order by their physical properties. In 1817, a letter reported [[Johann Wolfgang Dobereiner]]'s observations of the alkaline earths; namely, that strontium had properties that were intermediate to those of calcium and barium.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Wurzer|first1=Ferdinand|title=Auszug eines Briefes vom Hofrath Wurzer, Prof. der Chemie zu Marburg|journal=Annalen der Physik|date=1817|volume=56|pages=331–334|url=https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=chi.096071138;view=1up;seq=351|trans-title=Excerpt of a letter from Court Advisor Wurzer, Professor of Chemistry at Marburg|language=German}}  From pp. 332–333:  ''"In der Gegend von Jena (bei Dornburg) … Schwerspaths seyn möchte."'' (In the area of Jena (near Dornburg) it is known that [[celestine (mineral)|celestine]] has been discovered in large quantities.  This gave Mr. Dobereiner cause to inquire rigorously into the stoichiometric value of strontium oxide by a great series of experiments.  It turned out that it [i.e., the molar weight of strontium oxide] – if that of hydrogen is expressed by 1 or that of oxygen is expressed by the number 7.5 – is equal to 50.  This number is, however, precisely the arithmetic mean of that which denotes the stoichiometric value of calcium oxide (= 27.55) and of that which denotes the stoichiometric value of barium oxide (= 72.5) ; namely (27.5 + 72.5) / 2 = 50.  For a moment, Mr. Dobereiner found himself thereby caused to doubt the independent existence of strontium; however, this withstood both his analytical and synthetic experiments.  Even more noteworthy is the circumstance that the specific weight of strontium sulfide is likewise the arithmetic mean of that of pure (water-free) calcium sulfide and that [i.e., the sulfide] of barium, namely (2.9 + 4.40) / 2 = 3.65 ; which must cause [one] to believe even more that celestine might be a mixture of equal stoichiometric amounts of anhydrite [i.e., anhydrous calcium sulfate] and barite.) &lt;/ref&gt;  By 1829, Dobereiner had found other groups of three elements (hence "triads") whose physical properties were similarly related.&lt;ref name=D1829&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Dobereiner|first1=J.

[[File:SnowflakesWilsonBentley.jpg|thumb|right|upright=1.20|The formation of complex symmetrical and [[fractal]] [[patterns in nature|patterns]] in [[snowflake]]s exemplifies emergence in a physical system]]
[[File:Termite Cathedral DSC03570.jpg|thumb|right|upright=1.10|A [[termite]] "cathedral" mound produced by a [[termites|termite colony]] offers a classic example of emergence in [[nature]] ]]

In [[philosophy]], [[systems theory]], [[science]], and [[art]], '''emergence''' is the condition of an entity having properties its parts do not have, due to interactions among the parts.

Emergence plays a central role in theories of [[integrative level]]s and of [[complex system]]s.  For instance, the phenomenon of ''[[life]]'' as studied in [[biology]] is an emergent property of [[chemistry]], and [[psychology|psychological]] phenomena emerge from the [[neurobiology|neurobiological]] phenomena of living things.

In philosophy, theories that emphasize emergent properties have been called [[emergentism]]. Almost all accounts of emergentism include a form of [[epistemic]] or [[ontological]] irreducibility to the lower levels.&lt;ref name=Wong/&gt;

==In philosophy==
{{Main|Emergentism}}

In philosophy, emergence is often understood to be a claim about the [[etiology]] of a system's properties.  An emergent property of a system, in this context, is one that is not a property of any component of that system, but is still a feature of the system as a whole. [[Nicolai Hartmann]], one of the first modern philosophers to write on emergence, termed this ''categorial novum'' (new category).

===Definitions===
This idea of emergence has been around since at least the time of [[Aristotle]].&lt;ref name="Meta"&gt;Aristotle, ''[[Metaphysics (Aristotle)|Metaphysics]]'', Book Η 1045a 8–10: "... the totality is not, as it were, a mere heap, but the whole is something besides the parts ...", i.e., the whole is other than the sum of the parts.&lt;/ref&gt;&amp;nbsp; [[John Stuart Mill]]&lt;ref&gt;"The chemical combination of two substances produces, as is well known, a third substance with properties different from those of either of the two substances separately, or of both of them taken together" {{Harv|Mill|1843}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Julian Huxley]]&lt;ref&gt;Julian Huxley: "now and again there is a sudden rapid passage to a totally new and more comprehensive type of order or organization, with quite new emergent properties, and involving quite new methods of further evolution" {{Harv|Huxley|Huxley|1947}}&lt;/ref&gt; are two of many scientists and philosophers who have written on the concept.

The term "emergent" was coined by philosopher [[George Henry Lewes|G. H. Lewes]], who wrote:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Every resultant is either a sum or a difference of the co-operant forces; their sum, when their directions are the same – their difference, when their directions are contrary.  Further, every resultant is clearly traceable in its components, because these are [[homogeneous]] and [[Commensurability (philosophy of science)|commensurable]]. It is otherwise with emergents, when, instead of adding measurable motion to measurable motion, or things of one kind to other individuals of their kind, there is a co-operation of things of unlike kinds. The emergent is unlike its components insofar as these are incommensurable, and it cannot be reduced to their sum or their difference.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harv|Lewes|1875|p=412}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harv|Blitz|1992}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Economist Jeffrey Goldstein provided a current definition of emergence in the journal ''Emergence''.&lt;ref name="Goldstein1999"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Goldstein|first1=Jeffrey|title=Emergence as a Construct: History and Issues|journal=Emergence|date=March 1999|volume=1|issue=1|pages=49–72|doi=10.1207/s15327000em0101_4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Goldstein initially defined emergence as: "the arising of novel and coherent structures, patterns and properties during the process of [[self-organization]] in complex systems".

Systems scientist Peter Corning described the qualities of Goldstein's definition in more detail:

&lt;blockquote&gt;The common characteristics are: (1) radical novelty (features not previously observed in systems); (2) coherence or correlation (meaning integrated wholes that maintain themselves over some period of time); (3) A global or macro "level" (i.e. there is some property of "wholeness"); (4) it is the product of a dynamical process (it evolves); and (5) it is "ostensive" (it can be perceived).&lt;ref name="Corning"&gt;{{Citation | doi = 10.1002/cplx.10043 | last = Corning | first = Peter A. | authorlink = Peter Corning | title = The Re-Emergence of "Emergence": A Venerable Concept in Search of a Theory | year = 2002 | journal = Complexity | volume = 7 | pages = 18–30 | url = http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cplx.10043/epdf | issue = 6 | bibcode = 2002Cmplx...7f..18C | deadurl = no | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20180202055002/http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cplx.10043/epdf | archivedate = 2018-02-02 | df =  | citeseerx = 10.1.1.114.1724 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Peter Corning suggests a narrower definition, requiring that the components be unlike in kind (following Lewes), and that they involve [[division of labor]] between these components. He also says that living systems (like the game of [[chess]]), while emergent, cannot be reduced to underlying laws of emergence:

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;span id="CorningDefn" class="citation"&gt;Rules, or laws, have no causal efficacy; they do not in fact “generate” anything. They serve merely to describe regularities and consistent relationships in nature. These patterns may be very illuminating and important, but the underlying causal agencies must be separately specified (though often they are not). But that aside, the game of chess illustrates ... why any laws or rules of emergence and evolution are insufficient. Even in a chess game, you cannot use the rules to predict “history” – i.e., the course of any given game. Indeed, you cannot even reliably predict the next move in a chess game. Why? Because the “system” involves more than the rules of the game. It also includes the players and their unfolding, moment-by-moment decisions among a very large number of available options at each choice point. The game of chess is inescapably historical, even though it is also constrained and shaped by a set of rules, not to mention the laws of physics. Moreover, and this is a key point, the game of chess is also shaped by [[teleonomic]], [[cybernetic]], feedback-driven influences. It is not simply a self-ordered process; it involves an organized, “purposeful” activity.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;ref name = Corning/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Strong and weak emergence===

Usage of the notion "emergence" may generally be subdivided into two perspectives, that of "weak emergence" and "strong emergence".  In terms of physical systems, weak emergence is a type of emergence in which the emergent property is amenable to computer simulation. This is opposed to the older notion of strong emergence, in which the emergent property cannot be simulated by a computer.

Some common points between the two notions are that emergence concerns new properties produced as the system grows, which is to say ones which are not shared with its components or prior states. Also, it is assumed that the properties are [[supervenient]] rather than metaphysically primitive {{Harv|Bedau|1997}}.

Weak emergence describes new properties arising in systems as a result of the interactions at an elemental level. However, it is stipulated that the properties can be determined only by observing or simulating the system, and not by any process of analysis.

Bedau notes that weak emergence is not a universal metaphysical solvent, as the hypothesis that consciousness is weakly emergent would not resolve the traditional philosophical questions about the physicality of consciousness. However, Bedau concludes that adopting this view would provide a precise notion that emergence is involved in consciousness, and second, the notion of weak emergence is metaphysically benign.{{Harv|Bedau|1997}}

Strong emergence describes the direct causal action of a high-level system upon its components; qualities produced this way are [[irreducible (philosophy)|irreducible]] to the system's constituent parts  {{Harv|Laughlin|2005}}. The whole is other than the sum of its parts. An example from physics of such emergence is water, being seemingly unpredictable even after an exhaustive study of the properties of its constituent atoms of hydrogen and oxygen.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Luisi|first=Pier L.|title=The Emergence of Life: From Chemical Origins to Synthetic Biology|year=2006|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=Cambridge, England|isbn=0521821177|page=119|url=http://www.cambridge.org/us/academic/subjects/chemistry/organic-chemistry/emergence-life-chemical-origins-synthetic-biology|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151117023700/http://www.cambridge.org/us/academic/subjects/chemistry/organic-chemistry/emergence-life-chemical-origins-synthetic-biology|archivedate=2015-11-17|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; It follows then that no simulation of the system can exist, for such a simulation would itself constitute a reduction of the system to its constituent parts.{{Harv|Bedau|1997}}

====Rejecting the distinction====

However, "the debate about whether or not the whole can be predicted from the properties of the parts misses the point. Wholes produce unique combined effects, but many of these effects may be co-determined by the context and the interactions between the whole and its environment(s)" {{Harv|Corning|2002}}. In accordance with his Synergism Hypothesis, {{Harv|Corning 1983|2005}} Corning also stated, "It is the [[synergistic]] effects produced by wholes that are the very cause of the evolution of complexity in nature." Novelist Arthur Koestler used the metaphor of [[Janus]] (a symbol of the unity underlying complements like open/shut, peace/war) to illustrate how the two perspectives (strong vs. weak or [[holistic]] vs. [[reductionistic]]) should be treated as non-exclusive, and should work together to address the issues of emergence.{{Harv|Koestler|1969}} Further,

&lt;blockquote&gt;The ability to reduce everything to simple fundamental laws does not imply the ability to start from those laws and reconstruct the universe. The constructionist hypothesis breaks down when confronted with the twin difficulties of scale and complexity. At each level of complexity entirely new properties appear. Psychology is not applied biology, nor is biology applied chemistry. We can now see that the whole becomes not merely more, but very different from the sum of its parts.{{Harv|Anderson|1972}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;

====Viability of strong emergence====

The plausibility of strong emergence is questioned by some as contravening our usual understanding of physics. Mark A. Bedau observes:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Although strong emergence is logically possible, it is uncomfortably like magic. How does an irreducible but supervenient downward causal power arise, since by definition it cannot be due to the aggregation of the micro-level potentialities? Such causal powers would be quite unlike anything within our scientific ken. This not only indicates how they will discomfort reasonable forms of materialism. Their mysteriousness will only heighten the traditional worry that emergence entails illegitimately getting something from nothing.&lt;ref name = Bedau&gt;(Bedau 1997)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Strong emergence can be criticized for being causally [[Overdetermination|overdetermined]]. The canonical example concerns emergent mental states (M and M∗) that supervene on physical states (P and P∗) respectively. Let M and M∗ be emergent properties. Let M∗ supervene on base property P∗. What happens when M causes M∗? [[Jaegwon Kim]] says:

&lt;blockquote&gt;In our schematic example above, we concluded that M causes M∗ by causing P∗. So M causes P∗. Now, M, as an emergent, must itself have an emergence base property, say P. Now we face a critical question: if an emergent, M, emerges from basal condition P, why cannot P displace M as a cause of any putative effect of M? Why cannot P do all the work in explaining why any alleged effect of M occurred? If causation is understood as nomological (law-based) sufficiency, P, as M’s emergence base, is nomologically sufficient for it, and M, as P∗’s cause, is nomologically sufficient for P∗. It follows that P is nomologically sufficient for P∗ and hence qualifies as its cause…If M is somehow retained as a cause, we are faced with the highly implausible consequence that every case of downward causation involves overdetermination (since P remains a cause of P∗ as well). Moreover, this goes against the spirit of emergentism in any case: emergents are supposed to make distinctive and novel causal contributions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Kim | first1 = Jaegwon | year = 2016 | title = Emergence: Core ideas and issues | url = | journal = Synthese | volume = 151 | issue = | pages = 547–59 | doi = 10.1007/s11229-006-9025-0 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

If M is the cause of M∗, then M∗ is overdetermined because M∗ can also be thought of as being determined by P. One escape route that a strong emergentist could take would be to deny [[downward causation]]. However, this would remove the proposed reason that emergent mental states must supervene on physical states, which in turn would call [[physicalism]] into question, and thus be unpalatable for some philosophers and physicists.

Meanwhile, others have worked towards developing analytical evidence of strong emergence. In 2009, Gu et al. presented a class of physical systems that exhibits non-computable macroscopic properties.&lt;ref name="morereally"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Gu | first1 = Mile | display-authors = 1 | last2 = et al | year = 2009 | title = More really is different | url = http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0167278909000852 | journal = Physica D: Nonlinear Phenomena | volume = 238 | issue = 9| pages = 835–39 | doi=10.1016/j.physd.2008.12.016| arxiv = 0809.0151 | bibcode = 2009PhyD..238..835G }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="binder"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Binder | first1 = P-M | year = 2009 | title = Computation: The edge of reductionism | url = | journal = Nature | volume = 459 | issue = 7245| pages = 332–34 | doi=10.1038/459332a| bibcode = 2009Natur.459..332B}}&lt;/ref&gt; More precisely, if one could compute certain macroscopic properties of these systems from the microscopic description of these systems, then one would be able to solve computational problems known to be undecidable in computer science. They concluded that

&lt;blockquote&gt;Although macroscopic concepts are essential for understanding our world, much of fundamental physics has been devoted to the search for a `theory of everything', a set of equations that perfectly describe the behavior of all fundamental particles. The view that this is the goal of science rests in part on the rationale that such a theory would allow us to derive the behavior of all macroscopic concepts, at least in principle. The evidence we have presented suggests that this view may be overly optimistic. A `theory of everything' is one of many components necessary for complete understanding of the universe, but is not necessarily the only one. The development of macroscopic laws from first principles may involve more than just systematic logic, and could require conjectures suggested by experiments, simulations or insight.&lt;ref name="morereally" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Emergence and interaction===

Emergent structures are patterns that emerge via collective actions of many individual entities. To explain such patterns, one might conclude, per [[Aristotle]],&lt;ref name="Meta" /&gt; that emergent structures are other than the sum of their parts on the assumption that the emergent order will not arise if the various parts simply interact independently of one another. However, there are those who [[A New Kind of Science#Simple programs|disagree]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.physlink.com/Education/essay_weinberg.cfm|title=A Designer Universe?|author=Steven Weinberg|accessdate=2008-07-14|quote=A version of the original quote from address at the Conference on Cosmic Design, American Association for the Advancement of Science, Washington, D.C. in April 1999|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100519145647/http://www.physlink.com/education/essay_weinberg.cfm|archivedate=2010-05-19|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to this argument, the interaction of each part with its immediate surroundings causes a complex chain of processes that can lead to order in some form. In fact, some systems in nature are observed to exhibit emergence based upon the interactions of autonomous parts, and some others exhibit emergence that at least at present cannot be reduced in this way. In particular [[Renormalization group|renormalization]] are methods in theoretical physics which enables scientists to study systems that are not tractable as the combination of their parts.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Longo|first=Giuseppe|last2=Montévil|first2=Maël|last3=Pocheville|first3=Arnaud|date=2012-01-01|year=|title=From bottom-up approaches to levels of organization and extended critical transitions|url=https://www.academia.edu/6188830/From_Bottom-Up_Approaches_to_Levels_of_Organization|journal=Fractal Physiology|volume=3|page=232|doi=10.3389/fphys.2012.00232|pmc=3429021|pmid=22934001|via=|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180202055001/http://www.academia.edu/6188830/From_Bottom-Up_Approaches_to_Levels_of_Organization|archivedate=2018-02-02|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Objective or subjective quality===
The properties of complexity and organization of any system are considered by Crutchfield to be [[Subjectivity|subjective]] [[Quality (philosophy)|qualities]] determined by the observer.

&lt;blockquote&gt;Defining structure and detecting the emergence of complexity in nature are inherently subjective, though essential, scientific activities. Despite the difficulties, these problems can be analysed in terms of how model-building observers infer from measurements the computational capabilities embedded in non-linear processes. An observer’s notion of what is ordered, what is random, and what is complex in its environment depends directly on its computational resources: the amount of raw measurement data, of memory, and of time available for estimation and inference. The discovery of structure in an environment depends more critically and subtly, though, on how those resources are organized. The descriptive power of the observer’s chosen (or implicit) computational model class, for example, can be an overwhelming determinant in finding regularity in data.{{Harv|Crutchfield|1994}}{{Citation needed|date=March 2018}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;

On the other hand, [[Peter Corning]] argues "Must the synergies be perceived/observed in order to qualify as emergent effects, as some theorists claim?  Most emphatically not.  The synergies associated with emergence are real and measurable, even if nobody is there to observe them."{{Harv|Corning|2002}}

==In religion, art and humanities==

In religion, emergence grounds expressions of [[religious naturalism]] and [[syntheism]] in which a sense of the [[sacred]] is perceived in the workings of entirely naturalistic processes by which more [[Complexity|complex]] forms arise or evolve from simpler forms. Examples are detailed in ''The Sacred Emergence of Nature'' by [[Ursula Goodenough]] &amp; [[Terrence Deacon]] and [http://www.edge.org/3rd_culture/kauffman06/kauffman06_index.html ''Beyond Reductionism: Reinventing the Sacred''] by [[Stuart Kauffman]], both from 2006, and in ''Syntheism – Creating God in The Internet Age'' by [[Alexander Bard]] &amp; [[Jan Söderqvist]] from 2014. An early argument (1904–05) for the emergence of social formations, in part stemming from religion, can be found in [[Max Weber]]'s most famous work, ''[[The Protestant Ethic and the Spirit of Capitalism]]''.&lt;ref&gt;McKinnon, AM. (2010). 'Elective affinities of the Protestant ethic: Weber and the chemistry of capitalism'. Sociological Theory, vol 28, no. 1, pp. 108–26.{{cite web |url=http://aura.abdn.ac.uk/bitstream/2164/3035/1/McKinnon_Elective_Affinities_final_non_format.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-10-26 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140818023547/http://aura.abdn.ac.uk/bitstream/2164/3035/1/McKinnon_Elective_Affinities_final_non_format.pdf |archivedate=2014-08-18 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In art, emergence is used to explore the origins of novelty, creativity, and authorship. Some art/literary theorists (Wheeler, 2006;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Wheeler|first=Wendy|title=The Whole Creature: Complexity, Biosemiotics and the Evolution of Culture|year=2006|publisher=Lawrence &amp; Wishart|location=London|isbn=1-905007-30-2|page=192}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Alexander, 2011&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Alexander|first=Victoria N.|title=The Biologist's Mistress: Rethinking Self-Organization in Art, Literature, and Nature|year=2011|publisher=Emergent Publications|location=Litchfield Park, AZ|isbn=0-9842165-5-3|url=http://emergentpublications.com/catalog_detail.aspx?Value=82|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141208050459/http://emergentpublications.com/catalog_detail.aspx?Value=82|archivedate=2014-12-08|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;) have proposed alternatives to postmodern understandings of "authorship" using the complexity sciences and emergence theory. They contend that artistic selfhood and meaning are emergent, relatively objective phenomena. [[Michael Pearce (artist)|Michael J. Pearce]] has used emergence to describe the experience of works of art in relation to contemporary neuroscience.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Pearce|first=Michael J.|title=Art in the Age of Emergence|year=2015|publisher=Cambridge Scholars Publishing|location=Manchester, England|isbn=1443870579|url=http://www.cambridgescholars.com/art-in-the-age-of-emergence|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150522021953/http://www.cambridgescholars.com/art-in-the-age-of-emergence|archivedate=2015-05-22|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Practicing artist [[Leonel Moura]], in turn, attrbutes to his "artbots" a real, if nonetheless rudimentary, creativity based on emergent principles&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.mdpi.com/2076-0752/7/3/28|author=Leonel Moura|date=16 July 2018|title=Robot Art: An Interview with Leonel Moura|publisher=Arts|doi=10.3390/arts7030028|accessdate=18 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

In international development, concepts of emergence have been used within a theory of social change termed [[SEED-SCALE]] to show how standard principles interact to bring forward socio-economic development fitted to cultural values, community economics, and natural environment (local solutions emerging from the larger socio-econo-biosphere). These principles can be implemented utilizing a sequence of standardized tasks that [[self-assemble]] in individually specific ways utilizing recursive evaluative criteria.&lt;ref&gt;Daniel C. Taylor, Carl E. Taylor, Jesse O. Taylor, ''Empowerment on an Unstable Planet: From Seeds of Human Energy to a Scale of Global Change'' (New York: Oxford University Press, 2012)&lt;/ref&gt;

In postcolonial studies, the term "Emerging Literature" refers to a contemporary body of texts that is gaining momentum in the global literary landscape (v. esp.: J.M. Grassin, ed. ''Emerging Literatures'', Bern, Berlin, etc. : Peter Lang, 1996). By opposition, "emergent literature" is rather a concept used in the theory of literature.

==Emergent properties and processes==
An emergent behavior or emergent property can appear when a number of simple [[entity|entities]] (agents) operate in an environment, forming more complex behaviors as a collective. If emergence happens over disparate size scales, then the reason is usually a causal relation across different scales. In other words, there is often a form of top-down feedback in systems with emergent properties.&lt;ref&gt;See, e.g., {{Citation | last = Korotayev | first = A. | authorlink1 = Andrey Korotayev | last2 = Malkov | given2 = A. | last3 = Khaltourina | first3 = D. | title = Introduction to Social Macrodynamics: Compact Macromodels of the World System Growth | place = Moscow | publisher = URSS | year = 2006 | isbn = 5-484-00414-4 | url = http://cliodynamics.ru/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=124&amp;Itemid=70 | deadurl = no | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20150814105834/http://cliodynamics.ru/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=124&amp;Itemid=70 | archivedate = 2015-08-14 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; The processes causing emergent properties may occur in either the observed or observing system, and are commonly identifiable by their patterns of accumulating change, generally called 'growth'. Emergent behaviours can occur because of intricate causal relations across different scales and feedback, known as [[interconnectivity]]. The emergent property itself may be either very predictable or unpredictable and unprecedented, and represent a new level of the system's evolution. The complex behaviour or properties are not a property of any single such entity, nor can they easily be predicted or deduced from behaviour in the lower-level entities, and might in fact be irreducible to such behavior.  The shape and behaviour of a flock of birds [https://www.newscientist.com/article/dn11679-flying-in-vformation-gives-best-view-for-least-effort.html] or school of fish are good examples of emergent properties.

One reason emergent behaviour is hard to predict is that the number of [[interaction]]s between a system components increases exponentially with the number of components, thus allowing for many new and subtle types of behaviour to emerge. Emergence is often a product of particular patterns of interaction. [[Negative feedback]] introduces constraints that serve to fix structures or behaviours. In contrast, [[positive feedback]] promotes change, allowing local variations to grow into global patterns. Another way in which interactions leads to emergent properties is [[dual-phase evolution]]. This occurs where interactions are applied intermittently, leading to two phases: one in which patterns form or grow, the other in which they are refined or removed.

On the other hand, merely having a large number of interactions is not enough by itself to guarantee emergent behaviour; many of the interactions may be negligible or irrelevant, or may cancel each other out.  In some cases, a large number of interactions can in fact hinder the emergence of interesting behaviour, by creating a lot of "noise" to drown out any emerging "signal"; the emergent behaviour may need to be temporarily isolated from other interactions before it reaches enough critical mass to self-support. Thus it is not just the sheer number of connections between components which encourages emergence; it is also how these connections are organised.  A hierarchical organisation is one example that can generate emergent behaviour (a bureaucracy may behave in a way quite different from that of the individual humans in that bureaucracy); but emergent behaviour can also arise from more decentralized organisational structures, such as a marketplace.  In some cases, the system has to reach a combined threshold of diversity, organisation, and connectivity before emergent behaviour appears.

[[Unintended consequence]]s and side effects are closely related to emergent properties. [[Luc Steels]] writes: "A component has a particular functionality but this is not recognizable as a subfunction of the global functionality. Instead a component implements a behaviour whose side effect contributes to the global functionality [...] Each behaviour has a side effect and the sum of the side effects gives the desired functionality".{{Harv|Steels|1990}} In other words, the global or macroscopic functionality of a system with "emergent functionality" is the sum of all "side effects", of all emergent properties and functionalities.

Systems with emergent properties or emergent structures may appear to defy [[entropy|entropic]] principles and the second law of [[thermodynamics]], because they form and increase order despite the lack of command and central control. This is possible because open systems can extract information and order out of the environment.

Emergence helps to explain why the [[fallacy of division]] is a fallacy.

==Emergent structures in nature==
{{main|Patterns in nature}}
{{Refimprove section|date=November 2008}}
[[File:Sand dune ripples.jpg|thumb|280px|right|Ripple patterns in a [[sand dune]] created by wind or water is an example of an emergent structure in nature.]]
[[File:Causeway-code poet-4.jpg|thumb|right|280px|[[Giant's Causeway]] in Northern Ireland is an example of a complex emergent structure.]]

Emergent structures can be found in many natural phenomena, from the physical to the biological domain. For example, the shape of weather phenomena such as [[hurricane]]s are emergent structures.  The development and growth of complex, orderly [[crystal]]s, as driven by the [[random motion]] of water molecules within a conducive natural environment, is another example of an emergent process, where [[randomness]] can give rise to complex and deeply attractive, orderly structures.
[[File:Water Crystals on Mercury 20Feb2010 CU1.jpg|thumb|280px|right|Water crystals forming on glass demonstrate an emergent, [[fractal]] process occurring under appropriate conditions of temperature and humidity.]]  However, crystalline structure and hurricanes are said to have a self-organizing phase.

It is useful to distinguish three forms of emergent structures. A ''first-order'' emergent structure occurs as a result of shape interactions (for example, [[hydrogen bond]]s in water molecules lead to [[surface tension]]). A ''second-order'' emergent structure involves shape interactions played out sequentially over time (for example, changing atmospheric conditions as a snowflake falls to the ground build upon and alter its form). Finally, a ''third-order'' emergent structure is a consequence of shape, time, and heritable instructions. For example, an organism's [[genetic code]] affects the form of the organism's systems in space and time.

===Nonliving, physical systems===
In [[physics]], emergence is used to describe a property, law, or phenomenon which occurs at macroscopic scales (in space or time) but not at microscopic scales, despite the fact that a macroscopic system can be viewed as a very large ensemble of microscopic systems.

An emergent property need not be more complicated than the underlying non-emergent properties which generate it.  For instance, the laws of [[thermodynamics]] are remarkably simple, even if the laws which govern the interactions between component particles are complex.  The term emergence in physics is thus used not to signify complexity, but rather to distinguish which laws and concepts apply to macroscopic scales, and which ones apply to microscopic scales. 

However, another, perhaps more broadly applicable way to conceive of the emergent divide does involve a dose of complexity insofar as the computational feasibility of going from the microscopic to the macroscopic property tells the 'strength' of the emergence. This is better understood given the following definition of emergence that comes from physics:

"An emergent behavior of a physical system is a qualitative property that can only occur in the limit that the number of microscopic constituents tends to infinity."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Kivelson |first1=Sophia |last2=Kivelson |first2=Steve |title=Defining Emergence in Physics |url=https://www.nature.com/articles/npjquantmats201624 |website=njp: Quantum Materials |publisher=Nature Research |accessdate=29 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since there are no actually infinite systems in the real world, there is no obvious naturally occurring notion of a hard separation between the properties of the constituents of a system and those of the emergent whole. As discussed below, classical mechanics is thought to be emergent from quantum mechanics, though in principal, quantum dynamics fully describes everything happening at a classical level. However, it would take a computer larger then the size of the universe with more computing time then life time of the universe to describe the motion of a falling apple in terms of the locations of its electrons {{citation needed|date=November 2018}}; thus we can take this to be a "strong" emergent divide. 

Some examples include:
* [[Classical mechanics]]:  The laws of classical mechanics can be said to emerge as a limiting case from the rules of [[quantum mechanics]] applied to large enough masses. This is particularly strange since quantum mechanics is generally thought of as ''more'' complicated than classical mechanics.
* [[Friction]]:  Forces between elementary particles are conservative.  However, friction emerges when considering more complex structures of matter, whose surfaces can convert mechanical energy into heat energy when rubbed against each other.  Similar considerations apply to other emergent concepts in [[continuum mechanics]] such as [[viscosity]], [[Elasticity (physics)|elasticity]], [[tensile strength]], etc.
* [[Patterned ground]]: the distinct, and often symmetrical geometric shapes formed by ground material in periglacial regions.
* [[Statistical mechanics]] was initially derived using the concept of a large enough [[statistical ensemble (mathematical physics)|ensemble]] that fluctuations about the most likely distribution can be all but ignored.  However, small clusters do not exhibit sharp first order [[phase transition]]s such as melting, and at the boundary it is not possible to completely categorize the cluster as a liquid or solid, since these concepts are (without extra definitions) only applicable to macroscopic systems.  Describing a system using statistical mechanics methods is much simpler than using a low-level atomistic approach.
* [[Electrical networks]]: The bulk conductive response of binary (RC) electrical networks with random arrangements, known as the [[Universal dielectric response | Universal Dielectric Response (UDR)]], can be seen as emergent properties of such physical systems. Such arrangements can be used as simple physical prototypes for deriving mathematical formulae for the emergent responses of complex systems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url = http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0378437112009363 | doi=10.1016/j.physa.2012.10.035 | volume=392 | title=The origin of power-law emergent scaling in large binary networks | year=2013 | journal=Physica A: Statistical Mechanics and its Applications | pages=1004–1027 | last1 = Almond | first1 = D.P. | last2 = Budd | first2 = C.J. | last3 = Freitag | first3 = M.A. | last4 = Hunt | first4 = G.W. | last5 = McCullen | first5 = N.J. | last6 = Smith | first6 = N.D.| arxiv=1204.5601 | bibcode=2013PhyA..392.1004A }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Weather]]

[[Temperature]] is sometimes used as an example of an emergent macroscopic behaviour.  In classical dynamics, a ''snapshot'' of the instantaneous momenta of a large number of particles at equilibrium is sufficient to find the average kinetic energy per degree of freedom which is proportional to the temperature.  For a small number of particles the instantaneous momenta at a given time are not statistically sufficient to determine the temperature of the system.  However, using the [[ergodic hypothesis]], the temperature can still be obtained to arbitrary precision by further averaging the momenta over a long enough time.

[[Convection]] in a liquid or gas is another example of emergent macroscopic behaviour that makes sense only when considering differentials of temperature. [[Convection cells]], particularly [[Bénard cells]], are an example of a [[self-organizing]] system (more specifically, a [[dissipative system]]) whose structure is determined both by the constraints of the system and by random perturbations: the possible realizations of the shape and size of the cells depends on the temperature gradient as well as the nature of the fluid and shape of the container, but which configurations are actually realized is due to random perturbations (thus these systems exhibit a form of [[symmetry breaking]]).

In some theories of particle physics, even such basic structures as [[mass]], [[space]], and [[time]] are viewed as emergent phenomena, arising from more fundamental concepts such as the [[Higgs boson]] or [[string theory|strings]].  In some interpretations of [[quantum mechanics]], the perception of a [[deterministic]] reality, in which all objects have a definite position, momentum, and so forth, is actually an emergent phenomenon, with the true state of matter being described instead by a [[wavefunction]] which need not have a single position or momentum.
Most of the laws of [[physics]] themselves as we experience them today appear to have emerged during the course of time making emergence the most fundamental principle in the universe{{According to whom|date=September 2016}} and raising the question of what might be the most fundamental law of physics from which all others emerged. [[Chemistry]] can in turn be viewed as an emergent property of the laws of physics. [[Biology]] (including biological [[evolution]]) can be viewed as an emergent property of the laws of chemistry.  Similarly, [[psychology]] could be understood as an emergent property of neurobiological laws. Finally, free-market theories understand [[economy]] as an emergent feature of psychology.

According to Laughlin (2005), for many particle systems, nothing can be calculated exactly from the microscopic equations, and macroscopic systems are characterised by broken symmetry: the symmetry present in the microscopic equations is not present in the macroscopic system, due to phase transitions. As a result, these macroscopic systems are described in their own terminology, and have properties that do not depend on many microscopic details. This does not mean that the microscopic interactions are irrelevant, but simply that you do not see them anymore&amp;nbsp;— you only see a renormalized effect of them. Laughlin is a pragmatic theoretical physicist: if you cannot, possibly ever, calculate the broken symmetry macroscopic properties from the microscopic equations, then what is the point of talking about reducibility?

===Living, biological systems===

====Emergence and evolution====
{{see also|Abiogenesis}}
[[Life]] is a major source of complexity, and [[evolution]] is the major process behind the varying forms of life. In this view, evolution is the process describing the growth of complexity in the natural world and in speaking of the emergence of complex living beings and life-forms, this view refers therefore to processes of sudden changes in evolution.

[[Life]] is thought to have emerged in the early [[RNA world hypothesis|RNA world]] when [[RNA]] chains began to express the basic conditions necessary for natural selection to operate as conceived by [[Charles Darwin|Darwin]]: heritability, variation of type, and competition for limited resources. [[Fitness (biology)|Fitness]] of an RNA replicator (its per capita rate of increase) would likely be a function of adaptive capacities that were intrinsic (in the sense that they were determined by the nucleotide sequence) and the availability of resources.&lt;ref name="Bernstein"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Bernstein | first1 = H | last2 = Byerly | first2 = HC | last3 = Hopf | first3 = FA | last4 = Michod | first4 = RA | last5 = Vemulapalli | first5 = GK | year = 1983 | title = The Darwinian Dynamic | url = https://www.jstor.org/discover/10.2307/2828805?uid=3739568&amp;uid=2&amp;uid=4&amp;uid=3739256&amp;sid=21102790068637 | journal = Quarterly Review of Biology | volume = 58 | issue = | pages = 185–207 | doi=10.1086/413216}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Michod"&gt;Michod RE. (2000) Darwinian Dynamics: Evolutionary Transitions in Fitness and Individuality.  Princeton University Press, Princeton, New Jersey {{ISBN|0691050112}}[javascript:]&lt;/ref&gt;  The three primary adaptive capacities may have been (1) the capacity to replicate with moderate fidelity (giving rise to both heritability and variation of type); (2) the capacity to avoid decay; and (3) the capacity to acquire and process resources.&lt;ref name=Bernstein /&gt;&lt;ref name =Michod /&gt;  These capacities would have been determined initially by the folded configurations of the RNA replicators (see “[[Ribozyme]]”) that, in turn, would be encoded in their individual nucleotide sequences. Competitive success among different replicators would have depended on the relative values of these adaptive capacities.

Regarding [[causality]] in evolution [[Peter Corning]] observes:
&lt;blockquote&gt;Synergistic effects of various kinds have played a major causal role in the evolutionary process generally and in the evolution of cooperation and complexity in particular... Natural selection is often portrayed as a “mechanism”, or is personified as a causal agency... In reality, the differential “selection” of a trait, or an adaptation, is a consequence of the functional effects it produces in relation to the survival and reproductive success of a given organism in a given environment. It is these functional effects that are ultimately responsible for the trans-generational continuities and changes in nature.{{nowrap|{{Harv|Corning|2002}}}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Per his [[#CorningDefn|definition of emergence]], Corning also addresses emergence and evolution:
&lt;blockquote&gt;[In] evolutionary processes, causation is iterative; effects are also causes. And this is equally true of the synergistic effects produced by emergent systems. In other words, emergence itself... has been the underlying cause of the evolution of emergent phenomena in biological evolution; it is the synergies produced by organized systems that are the key.{{nowrap|{{Harv|Corning|2002}}}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[Swarming]] is a well-known behaviour in many animal species from [[marching locusts]] to [[Shoaling and schooling|schooling fish]] to [[Flocking (behaviour)|flocking birds]]. Emergent structures are a common strategy found in many animal groups: colonies of ants, mounds built by termites, swarms of bees, shoals/schools of fish, flocks of birds, and herds/packs of mammals.

An example to consider in detail is an [[ant colony]]. The queen does not give direct orders and does not tell the ants what to do. Instead, each ant reacts to stimuli in the form of chemical scent from larvae, other ants, intruders, food and buildup of waste, and leaves behind a chemical trail, which, in turn, provides a stimulus to other ants. Here each ant is an autonomous unit that reacts depending only on its local environment and the genetically encoded rules for its variety of ant. Despite the lack of centralized decision making, ant colonies exhibit complex behavior and have even demonstrated the ability to solve geometric problems.  For example, colonies routinely find the maximum distance from all colony entrances to dispose of dead bodies.&lt;ref&gt;Steven Johnson. 2001. [[Emergence: The Connected Lives of Ants, Brains, Cities, and Software]]&lt;/ref&gt;

It appears that environmental factors may play a role in influencing emergence. Research suggests induced emergence of the bee species [[Macrotera portalis]]. In this species, the bees emerge in a pattern consistent with rainfall. Specifically, the pattern of emergence is consistent with southwestern deserts' late summer rains and lack of activity in the spring.&lt;ref name="Danforth2"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Danforth|first1=Bryan|title=Female Foraging and Intranest Behavior of a Communal Bee, Perdita portalis (Hymenoptera: Andrenidae)|journal=Annals of the Entomological Society of America|date=1991|volume=84|issue=5|pages=537–48|doi= 10.1093/aesa/84.5.537}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Organization of life====
A broader example of emergent properties in biology is viewed in the [[biological organisation]] of life, ranging from the [[subatomic]] level to the entire [[biosphere]]. For example, individual [[atom]]s can be combined to form [[molecule]]s such as [[polypeptide]] chains, which in turn [[Protein folding|fold]] and refold to form [[protein]]s, which in turn create even more complex structures. These proteins, assuming their functional status from their spatial conformation, interact together and with other molecules to achieve higher biological functions and eventually create an [[organism]]. Another example is how cascade [[phenotype]] reactions, as detailed in [[chaos theory]], arise from individual genes mutating respective positioning.&lt;ref&gt;[[Neil Campbell (scientist)|Campbell]], Neil A., and Jane B. Reece. ''Biology''. 6th ed. San Francisco: Benjamin Cummings, 2002.&lt;/ref&gt; At the highest level, all the [[biocoenosis|biological communities]] in the world form the biosphere, where its human participants form societies, and the complex interactions of meta-social systems such as the stock market.

====Emergence of mind====
Among the considered phenomena in the evolutionary account of life, as a continuous history, marked by stages at which fundamentally new forms have appeared - the origin of sapiens intelligence.&lt;ref&gt;[https://global.britannica.com/science/emergence-science Emergence // Encyclopædia Britannica, 2017]&lt;/ref&gt; The emergence of mind and its evolution is researched and considered as a separate phenomenon in a special system knowledge [[noogenesis]]&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.researchgate.net/publication/259390703_Eryomin_A.L._Noogenesis_and_Theory_of_Intellect._Krasnodar_2005.__356_p.__._.____.___2005.__356_ Eryomin A.L.

==In humanity==

===Spontaneous order===
{{see also|Spontaneous order|Self-organization}}
Groups of human beings, left free to each regulate themselves, tend to produce [[spontaneous order]], rather than the meaningless chaos often feared. This has been observed in society at least since [[Zhuang Zhou|Chuang Tzu]] in ancient China. A classic [[traffic]] [[roundabout]] is a good example, with cars moving in and out with such effective organization that some modern cities have begun replacing stoplights at problem intersections with traffic circles [http://www.terrain.org/articles/2/siegman.htm], and getting better results. [[Open-source software]] and [[Wiki]] projects form an even more compelling illustration.

Emergent processes or behaviors can be seen in many other places, such as cities, [[cabal]] and [[market-dominant minority]] phenomena in economics, organizational phenomena in [[computer simulation]]s and [[cellular automata]].  Whenever there is a multitude of individuals interacting, an order emerges from disorder; a pattern, a decision, a structure, or a change in direction occurs.&lt;ref&gt;Miller, Peter.  2010.  The Smart Swarm: How understanding flocks, schools, and colonies can make us better at communicating, decision making, and getting things done.  New York: Avery.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Economics====
The [[stock market]] (or any market for that matter) is an example of emergence on a grand scale.  As a whole it precisely regulates the relative security prices of companies across the world, yet it has no leader; when no [[Economic planning|central planning]] is in place, there is no one entity which controls the workings of the entire market.  Agents, or investors, have knowledge of only a limited number of companies within their portfolio, and must follow the regulatory rules of the market and analyse the transactions individually or in large groupings.  Trends and patterns emerge which are studied intensively by [[technical analysis|technical analysts]].{{Citation needed|date=August 2011}}.

====World Wide Web and the Internet====
The [[World Wide Web]] is a popular example of a decentralized system exhibiting emergent properties.  There is no central organization rationing the number of links, yet the number of links pointing to each page follows a [[power law]] in which a few pages are linked to many times and most pages are seldom linked to.  A related property of the network of links in the World Wide Web is that almost any pair of pages can be connected to each other through a relatively short chain of links.  Although relatively well known now, this property was initially unexpected in an unregulated network.  It is shared with many other types of networks called [[small-world network]]s.{{Harv|Barabasi, Jeong, &amp; Albert|1999|pp=130–31}}

Internet traffic can also exhibit some seemingly emergent properties. In the congestion control mechanism, [[Transmission Control Protocol|TCP]] flows can become globally synchronized at bottlenecks, simultaneously increasing and then decreasing throughput in coordination. Congestion, widely regarded as a nuisance, is possibly an emergent property of the spreading of bottlenecks across a network in high traffic flows which can be considered as a phase transition [see review of related research in {{Harv|Smith|2008|pp=1–31}}].

Another important example of emergence in web-based systems is [[social bookmarking]] (also called collaborative tagging). In social bookmarking systems, users assign tags to resources shared with other users, which gives rise to a type of information organisation that emerges from this crowdsourcing process. Recent research which analyzes empirically the complex dynamics of such systems&lt;ref name="TWEB-ref" &gt;Valentin Robu, Harry Halpin, Hana Shepherd [http://portal.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=1594173.1594176 Emergence of consensus and shared vocabularies in collaborative tagging systems], ACM Transactions on the Web (TWEB), Vol. 3(4), article 14, ACM Press, September 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; has shown that consensus on stable distributions and a simple form of shared vocabularies does indeed emerge, even in the absence of a central controlled vocabulary. Some believe that this could be because users who contribute tags all use the same language, and they share similar semantic structures underlying the choice of words. The convergence in social tags may therefore be interpreted as the emergence of structures as people who have similar semantic interpretation collaboratively index online information, a process called semantic imitation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

====Architecture and cities====
[[File:Bangkok skytrain sunset.jpg|thumb|right|300px| Traffic patterns in cities can be seen as an example of [[spontaneous order]]{{citation needed|date=January 2013}}]]
Emergent structures appear at many different [[integrative level|levels of organization]] or as [[spontaneous order]]. Emergent [[self-organization]] appears frequently in [[city|cities]] where no planning or zoning entity predetermines the layout of the city.{{Harv|Krugman|1996|pp=9–29}} The interdisciplinary study of emergent behaviors is not generally considered a [[wikt:Homogeneous|homogeneous]] field, but divided across its application or problem [[function domain|domains]].

Architects may not design all the pathways of a complex of buildings. Instead they might let usage patterns emerge and then place pavement where pathways have become worn, such as a [[desire path]].

The on-course action and vehicle progression of the [[DARPA Grand Challenge#2007 Urban Challenge|2007 Urban Challenge]] could possibly be regarded as an example of [[cybernetic]] emergence. Patterns of road use, indeterministic obstacle clearance times, etc. will work together to form a complex emergent pattern that can not be deterministically planned in advance.

The architectural school of [[Christopher Alexander]] takes a deeper approach to emergence, attempting to rewrite the process of urban growth itself in order to affect form, establishing a new methodology of planning and design tied to traditional practices, an [http://emergenturbanism.com/2009/03/23/the-journey-to-emergence/ Emergent Urbanism]. Urban emergence has also been linked to theories of urban complexity {{Harv|Batty|2005}} and urban evolution.{{Harv|Marshall|2009}}

Building ecology is a conceptual framework for understanding architecture and the built environment as the interface between the dynamically interdependent elements of buildings, their occupants, and the larger environment. Rather than viewing buildings as inanimate or static objects, building ecologist Hal Levin views them as interfaces or intersecting domains of living and non-living systems.&lt;ref name="microbe.net"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.microbe.net/fact-sheet-building-ecology/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-08-04 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120203182235/http://www.microbe.net/fact-sheet-building-ecology/ |archivedate=2012-02-03 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The microbial ecology of the indoor environment is strongly dependent on the building materials, occupants, contents, environmental context and the indoor and outdoor climate.  The strong relationship between atmospheric chemistry and indoor air quality and the chemical reactions occurring indoors. The chemicals may be nutrients, neutral or biocides for the microbial organisms. The microbes produce chemicals that affect the building materials and occupant health and well being. Humans manipulate the ventilation, temperature and humidity to achieve comfort with the concomitant effects on the microbes that populate and evolve.&lt;ref name="microbe.net"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.microbe.net {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110723210118/http://www.microbe.net/ |date=2011-07-23 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://buildingecology.com {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110808024931/http://www.buildingecology.com/ |date=2011-08-08 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Eric Bonabeau's attempt to define emergent phenomena is through traffic: "traffic jams are actually very complicated and mysterious. On an individual level, each driver is trying to get somewhere and is following (or breaking) certain rules, some legal (the speed limit) and others societal or personal (slow down to let another driver change into your lane). But a traffic jam is a separate and distinct entity that emerges from those individual behaviors. [[Gridlock]] on a highway, for example, can travel backward for no apparent reason, even as the cars are moving forward." He has also likened emergent phenomena to the analysis of market trends and employee behavior.&lt;ref&gt;Bonabeau E. Predicting the Unpredictable. Harvard Business Review [serial online]. March 2002. 80(3):109–16. Available from: Business Source Complete, Ipswich, MA. Accessed February 1, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

Computational emergent phenomena have also been utilized in architectural design processes, for example for formal explorations and experiments in digital materiality.&lt;ref&gt;Roudavski, Stanislav and Gwyllim Jahn (2012). 'Emergent Materiality though an Embedded Multi-Agent System', in 15th Generative Art Conference, ed. by Celestino Soddu (Lucca, Italy: Domus Argenia), pp. 348–63

&lt;/ref&gt;

===Computer AI===
Some artificially intelligent (AI) computer applications utilize emergent behavior for animation. One example is [[Boids]], which mimics the [[swarming behavior]] of birds.

=== Language ===
It has been argued that the structure and regularity of [[language]] [[grammar]], or at least [[language change]], is an emergent phenomenon {{Harv|Hopper|1998}}. While each speaker merely tries to reach his or her own communicative goals, he or she uses language in a particular way. If enough speakers behave in that way, language is changed {{Harv|Keller|1994}}. In a wider sense, the norms of a language, i.e. the linguistic conventions of its speech society, can be seen as a system emerging from long-time participation in communicative problem-solving in various social circumstances {{Harv|Määttä|2000}}.

===Emergent change processes===
Within the field of group facilitation and organization development, there have been a number of new group processes that are designed to maximize emergence and self-organization, by offering a minimal set of effective initial conditions. Examples of these processes include [[SEED-SCALE]], [[Appreciative Inquiry]], Future Search, the World Cafe or [[Knowledge Cafe]], [[Open Space Technology]], and others (Holman, 2010&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Holman|first=Peggy|date=December 2010 – January 2011|title=Engaging Emergence: Turning Upheaval into Opportunity|url=http://peggyholman.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/06/211001pkSystems-Thinkerarticle.pdf|journal=Pegasus Communication: The Systems Thinker|volume=21|pages=|via=|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130418075443/http://peggyholman.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/06/211001pkSystems-Thinkerarticle.pdf|archivedate=2013-04-18|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7314">A '''false dilemma''' is a type of [[informal fallacy]] in which something is falsely claimed to be an [[Exclusive_or#Exclusive_"or"_in_English|"either/or"]] situation, when in fact there is at least one additional option.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.txstate.edu/philosophy/resources/fallacy-definitions/False-Dilemma.html |title=False Dilemma |publisher= Department of Philosophy, [[Texas State University]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A false [[dilemma]] can arise intentionally, when a fallacy is used in an attempt to force a choice or outcome. The opposite of this fallacy is [[false compromise]]. For example, what is described as the "TINA factor" in elections is often in reality a false dilemma, as there are about 3 to 25 electoral candidates for most electoral seats.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Rajiv's TINA factor |url=https://www.indiatoday.in/magazine/cover-story/story/19880229-there-is-no-alternative-to-prime-minister-rajiv-gandhi-and-the-congressi-poll-796992-1988-02-29 |accessdate=27 November 2018 |publisher=India Today |date=29 February 1988}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The false dilemma fallacy can also arise simply by accidental omission of additional options rather than by deliberate deception. For example, "Stacey spoke out against capitalism, therefore she must be a communist" (she may be neither capitalist nor communist). "Roger opposed an atheist argument against Christianity, so he must be a Christian" (When it's assumed the opposition by itself means he's a Christian). Roger might be an atheist who disagrees with the logic of some particular argument against Christianity. Additionally, it can be the result of habitual tendency, whatever the cause, to view the world with limited sets of options.

Some [[philosopher]]s and scholars believe that "unless a distinction can be made rigorous and precise it isn't really a distinction".&lt;ref&gt;[[Jacques Derrida]] (1991) ''Afterword: Toward An Ethic of Discussion'', published in the English translation of ''[[Limited Inc.]]'', pp. 123–24, 126&lt;/ref&gt; An exception is [[analytic philosopher]] [[John Searle]], who called it an incorrect assumption that produces false dichotomies.&lt;ref name="Searle83"&gt;Searle, John. (1983) ''The Word Turned Upside Down''. The New York Review of Books, Volume 30, Number 16, October 27, 1983.&lt;/ref&gt; Searle insists that "it is a condition of the adequacy of a precise theory of an indeterminate phenomenon that it should precisely characterize that phenomenon as indeterminate; and a distinction is no less a distinction for allowing for a family of related, marginal, diverging cases."&lt;ref name="Searle83"/&gt; Similarly, when two options are presented, they often are, although not always, two extreme points on some spectrum of possibilities; this may lend credence to the larger argument by giving the impression that the options are [[mutually exclusive events|mutually exclusive]] of each other, even though they need not be.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Baronett|first1=Stan|title=Logic|date=2008|publisher=Pearson Prentice Hall|location=Upper Saddle River, N.J.|isbn=9780131933125|page=101|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=5ZfjSDw4eq4C&amp;pg=PT101|accessdate=31 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, the options in false dichotomies typically are presented as being [[collectively exhaustive events|collectively exhaustive]], in which case the fallacy may be overcome, or at least weakened, by considering other possibilities, or perhaps by considering a whole spectrum of possibilities, as in [[fuzzy logic]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Arfi|first1=Badredine|title=Linguistic fuzzy logic methods in social sciences|date=2010|publisher=Springer|location=Berlin, Germany|isbn=9783642133428|edition=1.|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Rlq8QMy7uTMC&amp;pg=PA63|accessdate=31 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Similar concepts==
Common phrases expressing similar or synonymous concepts include:

* false [[dichotomy]] (which more often describes the distinguishing of two things which are not necessarily distinct)
* false [[Wikt:binary#Adjective|binary]]
* false choice or the fallacy of false choice
* "black-and-white thinking" or "thinking in black and white"
* [[Wikt:bifurcation#Noun|bifurcation]]
* "denying a [[Wikt:conjunct#Noun|conjunct]]" (similar to a false dichotomy)
* either/or fallacy
* fallacy of exhaustive hypotheses
* fallacy of the excluded middle
* fallacy of the false alternative{{citation needed|date=January 2017}}

==Examples==

===False choice===
The presentation of a ''false choice'' often reflects a deliberate attempt to eliminate several options that may occupy the middle ground on an issue. A common argument against [[noise pollution]] laws involves a false choice. It might be argued that in [[New York City]] noise should not be regulated, because if it were, the city would drastically change in a negative way. This argument assumes that, for example, a bar must be shut down to prevent disturbing levels of noise emanating from it after midnight. This ignores the fact that the bar could simply lower its noise levels, or install [[soundproofing]] structural elements to keep the noise from excessively transmitting onto others' properties.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author1=Desantis, Nick|title=Data Shows Bars With Most Noise Complaints, But Is It Just Sound and Fury?|url=http://eastvillage.thelocal.nytimes.com/2012/01/23/noise-complaints/|accessdate=31 October 2015|work=The New York Times|date=23 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Black-and-white thinking===
{{See also|Splitting (psychology)|Binary opposition}}

In psychology, a phenomenon related to the false dilemma is black-and-white thinking. There are people who routinely engage in black-and-white thinking, an example of which is someone who categorizes other people as all good or all bad.&lt;ref&gt;AJ Giannini. "Use of fiction in therapy". ''Psychiatric Times''. 18(7): 56–57, 2001.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Feminist sexology''' is an offshoot of traditional studies of [[sexology]] that focuses on the [[intersectionality]] of [[sex]] and [[gender]] in relation to the [[sexual lives]] of [[women]]. Sexology has a basis in psychoanalysis, specifically Freudian theory, which played a big role in early sexology.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Cohler|first=Bertram J.|last2=Galatzer-Levy|first2=Robert M.|date=2008-01-03|title=Freud, Anna, and the Problem of Female Sexuality|journal=Psychoanalytic Inquiry|volume=28|issue=1|pages=3–26|doi=10.1080/07351690701787085|issn=0735-1690}}&lt;/ref&gt; This reactionary field of feminist sexology seeks to be inclusive of experiences of sexuality and break down the problematic ideas that have been expressed by sexology in the past. [[Feminist]] sexology shares many principles with the overarching field of sexology; in particular, it does not try to prescribe a certain path or "normality" for women's sexuality, but only observe and note the different and varied ways in which women express their sexuality. It is a young field, but one that is growing rapidly.

==Themes==
Many of the topics that feminist sexologists study include (but are not limited to) [[reproductive rights]], [[sex work]], [[gay]] and [[transgender]] identities, [[marriage]], [[pornography]] and [[gender roles]]. Much of the work within feminist sexology has been done within the last few decades, focusing on the movements of sexual liberation in the 1960s and 1970s, the introduction of an easily handled and effective means of contraception, [[lesbian]] and transgender visibility, and the stronger waves of women taking charge of their lives. There has been much debate about whether the sexual revolution was really beneficial to women, if a pro-sex attitude can really be achieved within the context of Western society, but as new voices are lifted, layers of interpretation and knowledge can be gathered.

* Lesbianism - Lesbianism is a major theme of feminist sexology. Lesbian society and culture is one that is often over-looked by general society resulting in lesbian women being disregarded and ultimately ignored in public and professional spaces. In the workplace, for example, lesbian women are often still sexualized and forced to play the role of the ‘heterosexual female.’ Feminist theorist Adrienne Rich discusses this type of oppression in her article, “Compulsory Heterosexuality.” Adrienne Rich claims,
&lt;blockquote&gt;“Women endure sexual harassment to keep their jobs and learn to behave in a complacently and ingratiatingly heterosexual manner… the woman who too decisively resists sexual overtures in the workplace is accused of being ‘dried-up and sexless, or lesbian.”&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;Rich, A. (1980). Compulsory heterosexuality and lesbian existence. ''Signs: Journal of women in culture and society'', ''5''(4), 631-660.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
The lesbian in society is of utmost importance in that she bears the weight of judgement and oppression on her shoulders for love and the progression of the woman. On page 649 of “Compulsory Heterosexuality” Rich writes, 
&lt;blockquote&gt;“Lesbian existence comprises both the breaking of a taboo and the rejection of a compulsory way of life.”&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

* Prostitution - In Gayle Rubin’s article “Thinking Sex,” Rubin discusses the shift of prostitution from a once socially acceptable occupation to a now isolated and reprimanded occupation in modern-day society. This shift in society perception known as the “modernization of sex.” The modernization of sex in the case of prostitution is defined as; the organization of sex groups such as prostitutes, homoesexuals, sadomasochists, etc. into localized populations. On page 156 of “Thinking Sex” Rubin regards the occupation of prostitution and its place in present-day society,
	&lt;blockquote&gt;“Sex work is an occupation… Prostitutes are a criminal sexual population stigmatized on the basis of sexual activity… Prostitutes are the primary prey of vice police.”&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;Rubin, G. (1984). Thinking sex: Notes for a radical theory of the politics of sexuality. ''Social Perspectives in Lesbian and Gay Studies; A Reader'', 100-133.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Anti-prostitution laws have also surfaced in recent years, dismantling prostitution in local jurisdictions and restricting various forms of sexual commerce. On page 163, Rubin writes how these actions are justified:
	&lt;blockquote&gt;“[These actions are] rationalized by portraying them as menaces to health and safety, women and children… or civilization itself. Even when activity is acknowledged to be harmless, it may be banned because it is alleged to ‘lead’ to something ostensibly worse.”&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

* Children and Sexuality

In her article “Thinking Sex: Notes for a Radical Theory of the Politics of Sexuality,” Gayle Rubin states that society teaches children about gender and sex; they know nothing about it when they are born, because gender and sex are socially constructed ideas.  Society teaches our children about social norms through actions. This models gender through behavior and children learn to act in a certain way depending if they are male or female.&lt;br /&gt;

During the nineteenth century, the idea of masturbation was considered to be a taboo and unhealthy practice.  What was thought of as premature sexual interest in a child was strongly discouraged, because sexual excitement of any kind was thought to damage the health and discourage the maturation of a child. In the past, parents have resorted to extreme measures to prevent children from masturbating, such as tying them down to keep from touching themselves or even making permanent surgical changes to their genitals. While these extreme measures have for the most part been abandoned in today’s society, the attitude that the idea of sex is harmful to children still endures. &lt;br /&gt;

According to Anne Fausto-Stearling, Infant Genital Surgery is a cosmetic surgery performed on infants who do not fit into a defined gender category (sometimes with or without the parent’s consent).  The surgery reshapes their sexual reproductive organs into either male or female gender binaries without considering the child’s wishes or what they may have chosen later in life.  This can lead to gender confusion and unhappiness as the child grows, and may even have a biological physical impact on how the child’s reproductive organs develop.

* Sex and Respectability
Gayle Rubin argues that modern society judges sex acts through their theoretical value.  She states that “Marital, reproductive heterosexuals are alone at the top erotic pyramid.”  This means that because the people engaging in sex are married, heterosexual, and the possibility of reproduction is present, the act of sex has a higher value in accordance with societal norms.  Unmarried heterosexual sex is also valued, but not as much. Monogamous, heteronormative lesbian and gay relationships are not quite as respected, but are considered to still be of minimal value. “The most despised sexual castes currently include transsexuals, transvestites, fetishists, sadomasochists, sex workers such as prostitutes and porn models...” Solitary sex acts, or masturbation, are not even considered a part of the hierarchy.  These sex acts are ordered in such a way because of their ability to reproduce and create children. “According to this system, sexuality that is ‘good’, ‘normal’, and ‘natural’ should ideally be heterosexual, marital, monogamous, reproductive, and non-commercial.”  Anything relating to sex that breaks these societally prescribed rules is considered to be “bad” and “unnatural,” such as homosexuality, fetish objects, the use of pornography, and casual sex, amongst others.
 &lt;blockquote&gt;“All these hierarchies of sexual value – religious, psychiatric, and popular – function in much the same ways as do ideological systems of racism, ethnocentrism, and religious chauvinism. They rationalize the well-being of the sexually privileged and the adversity of the sexual rabble.”&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Influential thinkers==
* [[Anne Fausto-Sterling]] - Fausto-Sterling, with a background in biology, has written several books on the subject of how gender interacts and is shaped by biology, society and culture. In her book, Sexing the Body, she takes a close look on how the definition of our sex and gender as a species by the society relegates our sexual identities and actions. She also tackles these subjects in her other works, including her books ''Myths of Gender'' and ''Love, Power and Knowledge'' (which she co-wrote with Hilary Rose.)
* [[Gayle Rubin]] - Rubin, a [[cultural anthropology|cultural anthropologist]], focuses on many subjects, notably [[prostitution]], [[pornography]], [[sadomasochism]] and [[sexual subcultures]]. She has been a strong voice in the "pro-sex" arena of sexology, debating strongly the intersection of [[sexual identity]] and societal structure in the 1980s, during which it was dubbed the "[[Feminist Sex Wars]]." She also worked with [[Patrick Califia]] studying the gay [[Leather subculture|leather scene]].

==Three Main Points==

;Male power
Under the patriarchal culture of sexual desire, women are suppressed to express their true feeling about sexual behaviors. Women’s fear of desire keeps them quiet and justify society’s belief that men have the power and authority in the relationships. Women are not allowed to express their sexual needs and male power is against masturbation.

While being taught to be conservative about sexual desire, women are also taught in a contradictory way that their bodies should be readily available for the pleasure of men without having a sexual voice. Sexology has a basis within psychology and the way the DSM-5 has categorized female sexual dysfunctions play into issues of male power over the sexuality of women.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Taylor|first=Chloë|date=2015|title=Female Sexual Dysfunction, Feminist Sexology, and the Psychiatry of the Normal|jstor=10.15767/feministstudies.41.2.259|journal=Feminist Studies|volume=41|issue=2|pages=259–292|doi=10.15767/feministstudies.41.2.259}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Angel, K. (2010). The history of ‘female sexual dysfunction’ as a mental disorder in the 20th century. ''Current opinion in psychiatry,'' ''23''(6), 536.&lt;/ref&gt; When it comes to sexual dysfunction among women, most are categorized as the woman having lowered sexual desire that causes “personal distress” over a period of time. Often times, the personal distress that women are feeling is due to relationship problems, and an irritated partner from the lack of sexual desire. “Women are diagnosed and treated as sexually disordered because they have sex-related marital tensions, even if they are personally well adjusted to their sexual response.”&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The DSM-5 fails to recognize other reasons a woman may not want to engage in sexually activity, and does not talk about “sexual communication, emotion, whole body experience, taboo and danger, commitment, attraction, sexual knowledge, safety, respect, feelings about bodies, breast cycles, pregnancy, contraception or getting old.” Furthermore, the sexual sciences do not necessarily repress female sexuality as they base it on heteronormative masculinity without giving women a voice about their own sexuality.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Women not having a voice about their own sexuality is a highly recognized problem in various fields of feminist theory. In “The Uses of the Erotic: The Erotic as Power,” Audre Lorde offers the solution that the erotic can be used as power to gain a voice about sexuality that is not based on male desire.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; “Our acts against oppression become integral with self, motivated and empowered from within,” states Audre Lorde. For Lorde, “the erotic” is not just sexuality; it is the power for people to love and be passionate about what they do in life. She sees “the erotic” as “power” because she believes that if women have erotic “power”, they can have voice and be themselves in their lives.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;Lorde, Audre. The Uses of the Erotic. Kore Press, Jan. 2000.&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, the concept of [[compulsory heterosexuality]] makes the society believes that lesbian's sexuality is out of the norm. While there is a general recognition that the majority of sexual acts occur without the intent of reproduction, the definition of sex is still biological in nature, meaning that sex is heterosexual sex and that entails vaginal intercourse.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title=The Politics of Sexual Knowledge: Feminism and Sexology Textbooks|journal=Frontiers: A Journal of Women Studies|volume=9}}&lt;/ref&gt; Men believe that lesbians would defeat their power so they force heterosexuality as a default sexual orientation and disdain lesbians to make coming out difficult. Lesbianism is a threat to male supremacy because it destroys the myth about female inferiority, weakness, passivity.&lt;ref&gt;Bunch, Charlotte. ''Lesbians in Revolt''. 1972.&lt;/ref&gt;

Having said this, ideas about homosexuality are rooted in problematic ideas that were set forth by men in academic power. Homosexuality in general has historically been viewed by 20th century sexologists and psychoanalysts to be a disorder that people must normalize from.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Sexology in culture : labelling bodies and desires|date=1998|publisher=University of Chicago Press|others=Bland, Lucy., Doan, Laura L., 1951-|isbn=9780226056678|location=Chicago|oclc=38747894}}&lt;/ref&gt; Homosexuality from Sigmund Freud’s point of view was seen as a pathology in which people were affected by due to disturbances within psychosexual stages.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; From Freud’s theories about homosexuality, some came to the conclusion that homosexuality was something that could be treated. Additionally, Richard von Krafft-Ebing referred to lesbianism as being “incurable” although he still discussed how it could be treated.&lt;ref&gt;Maciejewski, S. P. (2016). The Relationship Between Sexology and the Lesbian Identity in Early 20th-Century Britain.&lt;/ref&gt;
;Sexual Violence
Sexual assault, rape and domestic sexual violence are serious issues in our society. Each year, for 35 of every 1,000 college women, those life-changing events will include a sexual assault.&lt;ref&gt;Fisher, Bonnie S., Francis T. Cullen, and Michael G. Turner. The Sexual Victimization of College Women. National Institute of Justice, Dec. 2000.&lt;/ref&gt; Many people blame sexual harassment and rape on women for staying outside at night, wearing short skirts, or flirting. The society puts the fault on women’s behaviors, trying to make them feel bad. When women start thinking themselves as “trouble makers”, they remain silent. Moreover, many victims are afraid of embarrassing their families and believe that rape victims rarely get justice, instead they will be scolded. Even though all women face this oppression, women of color are more vulnerable to sexual assault than white women. The Jezebel stereotype portrays women of colors as “unrapeable”.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://sapac.umich.edu/article/57 | title=Communities of Color and the Impacts of Sexual Violence &amp;#124; Sexual Assault Prevention and Awareness Center}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Jezebel stereotype began when 17th century European travelled to Africa and misinterpreted the nudity and polygamy of natives as uncontrollable sexual lust. This view of Black women was also perpetuated during slavery as a means to justify the sexual abuse, rape, and exploitation of these women by their slave owners.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://ferris.edu/HTMLS/news/jimcrow/jezebel/index.htm|title=The Jezebel Stereotype - Anti-black Imagery - Jim Crow Museum - Ferris State University|website=ferris.edu|language=en|access-date=2017-10-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; This stereotype is still widely used today in cinema, music, television and other forms of media.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; 
* Jezebel: The stereotype that deems African American women as promiscuous, seductive, hypersexual, uncaring, and willing to use sex as a way of manipulation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.skepticink.com/gps/2015/04/28/mammy-jezebel-sapphire-or-queen-stereotypes-of-the-african-american-female/|title=Mammy, Jezebel, Sapphire, or Queen? Stereotypes of the African-American Female • Great Plains Skeptic|date=2015-04-28|work=Great Plains Skeptic|access-date=2017-10-10|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; Followed by this stereotype is a belief that Black women should be responsible for being sexual assaulted. Society justifies rape as a crime that only happens to women who asked for it.
Sexual violence is also a significant problem that is faced by trans and gender-nonconforming people. Trans people are often discriminated against by medical professionals, police officers, the court system, and other authoritative figures.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/iamoneofthem-why-we-need-to-represent-trans-people_us_58e7a32be4b0acd784ca5768|title=#IAmOneOfThem: Why We Need To Represent Trans People In Sexual Assault Advocacy|last=Clements|first=K. C.|date=2017-04-07|website=Huffington Post|language=en-US|access-date=2017-10-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; Due to this, trans people are extremely vulnerable to sexual assault and often are not offered the resources to seek help, cope, and heal in a non judgmental setting. When looking at intersections of race, class, and ability, trans people are even more likely to be sexually assaulted when they face multiple levels of oppression.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;
;Control of Body
Women face the issue of not being able to make decisions regarding their reproductive rights or their bodies generally. Women are still fighting for access to birth control and the right of choice when it comes to abortion. Birth control and abortion have been highly politicized which has ended up politicizing women’s bodies.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite book|title=The politics of women's bodies : sexuality, appearance, and behavior|date=1998|publisher=Oxford University Press|others=Weitz, Rose, 1952-|isbn=9780195109948|location=New York|oclc=36470306}}&lt;/ref&gt; Poor women and women of color are likely to have even less option and access to making reproductive choices. In the Supreme Court Case, Webster v. Reproductive Health Services, banned public facilities and employees in Missouri from performing abortions unless it was a life saving procedure for the mother.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; Prior to this, Maher v. Roe determined that welfare payments could not be used for non therapeutic abortions even though they could be used expenses related to childbirth.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; These court decisions have ultimately worked in a way that do not allow poor women to choose to have an abortion.

Furthermore, women of color, especially Black, Latina, and Native American women have fallen victim to sterilization abuse. Native American women have faced being sterilized without consent or by being coerced as a result of the ideologies of imperialism, capitalism, patriarchy, and socioeconomic status.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Carpio|first=Myla Vicenti|date=2004|title=The Lost Generation: American Indian Women and Sterilization Abuse|jstor=29768273|journal=Social Justice|volume=31|issue=4 (98)|pages=40–53|doi=10.2307/29768273|doi-broken-date=2018-10-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sterilization abuse and the use birth control were seen as “a duty, not a right” for poor women of color.&lt;ref&gt;Davis, A. (2003). Racism, birth control and reproductive rights. ''Feminist Postcolonial Theory–A Reader'', 353-367.&lt;/ref&gt; Issues within reproductive rights and control of the body are not isolated to the western world but are also global issues. Many women around the world, especially in Africa and Asia, are the victims of sex trafficking, sex slavery, child labor, genital mutilation or cutting and sterilization. Those women neither have controls of their own bodies nor freedom to speak for themselves. The documentary, based on the book, [[Half the Sky: Turning Oppression into Opportunity for Women Worldwide]], focuses on this issues in six different countries. It talks about what sexual oppression women are facing in these places, how the government ignores and justifies the issues, and what organizations are working to fight for these victims.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.pbs.org/independentlens/half-the-sky/ | title=Half the Sky &amp;#124; Independent Lens}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The interrogators may interview the subject alternately or may confront the subject at the same time.

==Technique==
The "bad cop" takes an aggressive, negative stance towards the subject, making blatant accusations, derogatory comments, threats, and in general creating [[antipathy]] between the subject and himself. This sets the stage for the "good cop" to act sympathetically, appearing supportive and understanding, and in general showing [[sympathy]] for the subject. The good cop will also defend the subject from the bad cop. The subject may feel they can cooperate with the good cop either out of [[Trust (social sciences)|trust]] or out of fear of the bad cop. They may then seek protection by and trust the good cop and provide the information the interrogators are seeking.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url= https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=sBvHPS8iNI4C&amp;lpg=PA389&amp;dq=good%20cop%20bad%20cop%20tactic&amp;pg=PA389#v=onepage&amp;q=good%20cop%20bad%20cop%20tactic&amp;f=false |title= Promoting Community Change: Making it Happen in the Real World |publisher= Cengage Learning |year= 2010 |author= Mark Homan |isbn= 0840031955 |accessdate= 24 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This technique also has its disadvantages in that it can be easily identified and the "bad cop" may alienate the subject.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url= https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=-1ZX88iEZIYC&amp;lpg=PA114&amp;ots=l82ixe-HCU&amp;dq=good%20cop%20bad%20cop%20tactic&amp;pg=PA115#v=onepage |title= Mastering Business Negotiation |year= 2011 |publisher= John Wiley &amp; Sons |authors= Roy J.

{{Writing systems sidebar}}

An '''ideogram''' or '''ideograph''' (from [[Greek language|Greek]] {{lang|grc|ἰδέα}} ''idéa'' "idea" and {{lang|grc|γράφω}} ''gráphō'' "to write") is a [[graphic]] [[symbol]] that represents an [[idea]] or concept, independent of any particular language, and specific words or phrases.  Some ideograms are comprehensible only by familiarity with prior convention; others convey their meaning through pictorial resemblance to a physical object, and thus may also be referred to as [[pictogram]]s.

==Terminology==
{{further|Character (symbol)|Logogram}}
[[Image:Perros No.svg|thumb|"No dogs allowed" sign in Spain. The dog illustration is a [[pictogram]]. The red circle and bar is an ideogram representing the idea of "no" or "not allowed".]]
[[Image:EinKaremVisitationIdeogram.jpg|thumb|Ideograms in the [[Church of the Visitation]], Jerusalem]]
In [[proto-writing]], used for inventories and the like, physical objects are represented by stylized or conventionalized pictures, or [[pictogram]]s. For example, the pictorial [[Dongba symbols]] without [[Geba syllabary|Geba]] annotation cannot represent the [[Naxi language]], but are used as a mnemonic for reciting oral literature.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last = Ramsey | first = S. Robert | title = The Languages of China
|publisher = Princeton University Press | year = 1987 | isbn = 978-0-691-01468-5| page = 266}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Some systems also use ideograms, symbols denoting abstract concepts.

The term "ideogram" is often used to describe symbols of [[writing system]]s such as [[Egyptian hieroglyphs]], [[Sumerian cuneiform]] and [[Chinese character]]s.  However, these symbols are [[logogram]]s, representing words or morphemes of a particular language rather than objects or concepts. In these writing systems, a variety of strategies were employed in the design of logographic symbols.
Pictographic symbols depict the object referred to by the word, such as an icon of a bull denoting the Semitic word ''ʾālep'' "ox".
Some words denoting abstract concepts may be represented iconically, but most other words are represented using the [[rebus]] principle, borrowing a symbol for a similarly-sounding word. Later systems used selected symbols to represent the sounds of the language, for example the adaptation of the logogram for ''ʾālep'' "ox" as the [[letter (alphabet)|letter]] [[aleph]] representing the initial sound of the word, a [[glottal stop]].

Many signs in [[Egyptian hieroglyphs|hieroglyphic]] as well as in [[cuneiform writing]] could be used either logographically or phonetically. For example, the Akkadian sign [[dingir|AN]] ({{script|Xsux|[[Dingir|&amp;#x1202D;]]}}) could be an ideograph for "[[deity]]", an ideogram for the god [[An (mythology)|Anum]] in particular, a logograph for the  Akkadian stem ''[[ilah|il-]]'' "deity", a logograph for the Akkadian word  ''šamu'' "sky", or a [[syllabogram]] for either the syllable ''an'' or ''il''.

Although Chinese characters are logograms, two of the smaller classes in the [[Chinese character classification|traditional classification]] are ideographic in origin:
* Simple ideographs (指事字 ''zhǐshìzì'') are abstract symbols such as 上 ''shàng'' "up" and 下 ''xià'' "down" or numerals such as 三 ''sān'' "three".
* Semantic compounds (会意字 ''huìyìzì'') are semantic combinations of characters, such as 明 ''míng'' "bright", composed of 日 ''rì'' "sun" and 月 ''yuè'' "moon", or 休 ''xiū'' "rest", composed of 人 ''rén'' "person" and 木 ''mù'' "tree".  In the light of the modern understanding of [[Old Chinese phonology]], researchers now believe that most of the characters originally classified as semantic compounds have an at least partially phonetic nature.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | first = William | last = Boltz | title = The origin and early development of the Chinese writing system | publisher = American Oriental Society | year = 1994 | isbn = 978-0-940490-78-9 | pp = 67–72, 149 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

An example of ideograms is the [[DOT pictograms|collection of 50 signs]] developed in the 1970s by the  [[American Institute of Graphic Arts]] at the request of the [[US Department of Transportation]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aiga.org/symbol-signs Symbols and signs], AIGA.&lt;/ref&gt; The system was initially used to mark airports and gradually became more widespread.

==Mathematics==

Mathematical symbols are a type of ideogram.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Mathematics as Sign: Writing, Imagining, Counting |first=Brian |last=Rotman |year=2000 |publisher=Stanford University Press |isbn=978-0-8047-3684-8 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Proposed universal languages==
{{See also|Pasigraphy}}

Inspired by inaccurate early descriptions of Chinese and Japanese characters as ideograms, many Western thinkers have sought to design universal written languages, in which symbols denote concepts rather than words. An early proposal was ''[[An Essay towards a Real Character, and a Philosophical Language]]'' (1668) by [[John Wilkins]]. A recent example is the system of [[Blissymbols]], which was proposed by [[Charles K. Bliss]] in 1949 and currently includes over 2,000 symbols.&lt;ref&gt;Unger (2003), pp. 13–16.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Information and media literacy''' ('''IML''') enables people to interpret and make informed judgments as users of information and media, as well as to become skillful creators and producers of information and media messages in their own right.&lt;ref name="portal.unesco.org"/&gt;

Prior to the 1990s, the primary focus of [[information literacy]] was research skills.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://wik.ed.uiuc.edu/index.php/Information_Literacy |accessdate=July 16, 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090422143339/http://wik.ed.uiuc.edu/index.php/Information_Literacy |archivedate=April 22, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Media literacy]], a study that emerged around the 1970s, traditionally focuses on the analysis and the delivery of information through various forms of media.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.medialit.org/about_cml.html |title=About CML &amp;#124; Center for Media Literacy |publisher=Medialit.org |date= |accessdate=2013-07-28 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100825191946/http://www.medialit.org/about_cml.html |archivedate=2010-08-25 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Nowadays, the study of information literacy has been extended to include the study of media literacy in many countries like the UK,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.informationliteracy.org.uk/Information_literacy_definitions.aspx ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100730105014/http://www.informationliteracy.org.uk/Information_literacy_definitions.aspx |date=July 30, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Australia and New Zealand.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.anziil.org/resources/Info%20lit%202nd%20edition.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-07-16 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090530015206/http://www.anziil.org/resources/Info%20lit%202nd%20edition.pdf |archivedate=2009-05-30 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The term "information and media literacy" is used by [[UNESCO]]&lt;ref name="portal.unesco.org"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://portal.unesco.org/ci/en/ev.php-URL_ID=15886&amp;URL_DO=DO_TOPIC&amp;URL_SECTION=201.html |title=Media and Information Literacy |publisher=Portal.unesco.org |date= |accessdate=2013-07-28 }}{{dead link|date=November 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; to differentiate the combined study from the existing study of information literacy. It is also referred to as information and communication technologies ([[Information and communication technologies|ICT]]) in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.infolit.org/definitions.html ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090711210412/http://www.infolit.org/definitions.html |date=July 11, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ets.org/Media/Research/pdf/ICTREPORT.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; Educators such as [[Gregory Ulmer]] have also defined the field as [[electracy]].

IML is a combination of information literacy and media literacy. The purpose of being information and media literate is to engage in a digital society; one needs to be able to understand, inquire, create, communicate and think critically. It is important to effectively access, organize, analyze, evaluate, and create messages in a variety of forms.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.informationliteracy.org.uk/Information_literacy_definitions/Definitions.aspx ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100204091732/http://www.informationliteracy.org.uk/Information_literacy_definitions/Definitions.aspx |date=February 4, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The transformative nature of IML includes creative works and creating new knowledge; to publish and collaborate responsibly requires ethical, cultural and social understanding.

==21st-century students==
The IML learning capacities prepare students to be 21st century literate.  According to Jeff Wilhelm (2000), "technology has everything to do with literacy. And being able to use the latest electronic technologies has everything to do with being literate."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.teachnet-lab.org/fklane/wilhelm.htm Literacy by Design:  Why is all This Technology so Important?] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927034957/http://www.teachnet-lab.org/fklane/wilhelm.htm |date=2007-09-27 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He supports his argument with J. David Bolter's statement that "if our students are not reading and composing with various electronic technologies, then they are illiterate. They are not just unprepared for the future; they are illiterate right now, in our current time and context".&lt;ref&gt;Wilhelm, 2000, p.&amp;nbsp;4&lt;/ref&gt;

Wilhelm's statement is supported by the 2005 Wired World Phase II (YCWW II) survey conducted by the Media Awareness Network of Canada&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.media-awareness.ca |title=MediaSmarts |publisher=Media-awareness.ca |date= |accessdate=2013-07-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; on 5000 Grade 4 – 11 students.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.media-awareness.ca/english/research/YCWW/phaseII/key_findings.cfm |title=MediaSmarts |publisher=Media-awareness.ca |date= |accessdate=2013-07-28 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120425195852/http://www.media-awareness.ca/english/research/YCWW/phaseII/key_findings.cfm |archivedate=2012-04-25 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The key findings of the survey were:
*62% of Grade 4 students prefer the [[Internet]].
*38% of Grade 4 students prefer the library.
*91% of Grade 11 students prefer the Internet.
*9% of Grade 11 students prefer the library.&lt;ref&gt;YCWW II, 2005a, para. 28&lt;/ref&gt;

Marc Prensky (2001) uses the term "[[digital native]]" to describe people who have been brought up in a digital world.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.marcprensky.com/writing/Prensky%20-%20Digital%20Natives,%20Digital%20Immigrants%20-%20Part1.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; The Internet has been a pervasive element of young people's home lives. 94% of kids reported that they had Internet access at home, and a significant majority (61%) had a high-speed connection.

By the time kids reach Grade 11, half of them (51 percent) have their own Internet-connected computer, separate and apart from the family computer.&lt;ref&gt;YCWW II, 2005b, p.&amp;nbsp;6&lt;/ref&gt; The survey also showed that young Canadians are now among the most wired in the world. Contrary to the earlier stereotype of the isolated and awkward computer nerd, today's wired kid is a social kid.&lt;ref&gt;YCWW II, 2005b, p.&amp;nbsp;8&lt;/ref&gt;

In general, many students are better networked through the use of technology than most teachers and parents, who may not understand the abilities of technology. Students are no longer limited to desktop computera. They may use mobile technologies to graph mathematical problems, research a question for social studies, text message an expert for information, or send homework to a drop box.&lt;ref&gt;[http://homepages.wmich.edu/~b4poppen/IPhoneArticle3.doc ]{{dead link|date=July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Students are accessing information by using [[MSN]], personal Web pages, [[Weblog]]s and [[social network service|social networking sites]].

== Teaching and learning in the 21st century ==
{{unreferenced|date=June 2018|section}}
Many teachers continue the tradition of teaching of the past 50 years. Traditionally teachers have been the experts sharing their knowledge with children. Technology, and the learning tools it provides access to, forces us to change to being facilitators of learning.  We have to change the stereotype of teacher as the expert who delivers information, and students as consumers of information, in order to meet the needs of digital students. Teachers not only need to learn to speak digital, but also to embrace the language of digital natives.

Language is generally defined as a system used to communicate in which symbols convey information.  Digital natives can communicate fluently with digital devices and convey information in a way that was impossible without digital devices. People born prior to 1988 are sometimes referred to as "digital immigrants."  They experience difficulty programming simple devices like a VCR.  Digital immigrants do not start pushing buttons to make things work.

Learning a language is best done early in a child's development.

In acquiring a second language, Hyltenstam (1992) found that around the age of 6 and 7 seemed to be a cut-off point for bilinguals to achieve native-like proficiency.  After that age, second language learners could get near-native-like-ness but their language would, while consisting of very few actual errors, have enough errors that would set them apart from the first language group.

Kindergarten and grades 1 and 2 are critical to student success as digital natives because not all students have a "digital"-rich childhood.  Students learning technological skills before Grade 3 can become equivalently bilingual. "Language-minority students who cannot read and write proficiently in English cannot participate fully in American schools, workplaces, or society. They face limited job opportunities and earning power." Speaking "digital" is as important as being literate in order to participate fully in North American society and opportunities.

==Students' struggle==
Many students are considered illiterate in media and information for various reasons. They may not see the value of media and information literacy in the 21st-century classroom.  Others are not aware of the emergence of the new form of information.  Educators need to introduce IML to these students to help them become media and information literate.  Very little changes will be made if the educators are not supporting information and media literacy in their own classrooms.

Performance standards, the foundation to support them, and tools to implement them are readily available.  Success will come when there is full implementation and equitable access are established.  Shared vision and goals that focus on strategic actions with measurable results are also necessary.

When the staff and community, working together, identify and clarify their values, beliefs, assumptions, and perceptions about what they want children to know and be able to do, an important next step will be to discover which of these values and expectations will be achieved.&lt;ref&gt;Lambert, 1998, p.&amp;nbsp;6&lt;/ref&gt; Using the capacity tools to assess IML will allow students, staff and the community to reflect on how well students are meeting learning needs as related to technology.

The IML Performance standards allow data collection and analysis to evidence that student-learning needs are being met.  After assessing student IML, three questions can be asked:

* What does each student need to learn?
* How does one know whether students have met the capacities?
* How does one respond when students have difficulty in learning?

Teachers can use classroom assessment for learning to identify areas that might need increased focus and support.  Students can use classroom assessment to set learning goals for themselves.

==In the curriculum==
This integration of technology across the [[curriculum]] is a positive shift from computers being viewed as boxes to be learned to computers being used as [[technical communication tools]].  In addition, recent learning [[pedagogy]] recognizes the inclusion for students to be creators of knowledge through technology. [[International Society for Technology in Education]] (ISTE)&lt;ref&gt;http://www.iste.org/AM/Template.cfm?Section=About_ISTE&lt;/ref&gt; has been developing a standard IML curriculum for the US and other countries by implementing the [[National Educational Technology Standards]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://nets-implementation.iste.wikispaces.net/ |title=NETS Implementation - home |publisher=Nets-implementation.iste.wikispaces.net |date=2012-04-30 |accessdate=2013-07-28 }}{{dead link|date=September 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===UK===
In the UK, IML has been promoted among educators through an information literacy website&lt;ref&gt;http://www.informationliteracy.org.uk/&lt;/ref&gt; developed by several organizations that have been involved in the field.

===US===
IML is included in the Partnership for the 21st Century program sponsored by the US Department of Education.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.21stcenturyskills.org/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=254&amp;Itemid=120 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-07-16 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090314140756/http://www.21stcenturyskills.org/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=254&amp;Itemid=120 |archivedate=2009-03-14 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Special mandates have been provided to Arizona, Iowa, Kansas, Maine, New Jersey, Massachusetts, North Carolina, South Dakota, West Virginia and Wisconsin.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.21stcenturyskills.org/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=505&amp;Itemid=189 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-07-16 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090522125507/http://www.21stcenturyskills.org/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=505&amp;Itemid=189 |archivedate=2009-05-22 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Individual school districts, such as the Clarkstown Central School District,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ccsd.edu/bardonia/CCSDLibraryCurriculum/hrdcpy/Final%20Draft1.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-07-16 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060913115949/http://www.ccsd.edu/bardonia/CCSDLibraryCurriculum/hrdcpy/Final%20Draft1.pdf |archivedate=2006-09-13 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; have also developed their own information literacy curriculum. ISTE has also produced the National Educational Technology Standards for Students, Teachers and Administrators.

===Canada===
In [[British Columbia]], [[Canada]], the Ministry of Education has de-listed the Information Technology K to 7 IRP &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bced.gov.bc.ca/irp/resdocs/itk7.pdf Information Technology K to 7 IRP (1996)]&lt;/ref&gt; as a stand-alone course.  It is still expected that all the prescribed learning outcomes continue to be integrated.

This integration of technology across the curriculum is a positive shift from computers being viewed as boxes to be learned to computers being used as [[technical communication tools]]. In addition, recent learning [[pedagogy]] recognizes the inclusion for students to be creators of knowledge through technology.  Unfortunately, there has been no clear direction to implement IML.

The BC Ministry of Education published the Information and Communications Technology Integration Performance Standards, Grades 5 to 10 ICTI in 2005.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bced.gov.bc.ca/perf_stands/icti/ Information and Communications Technology Integration Performance Standards, Grades 5 to 10 ICTI (2005)]&lt;/ref&gt;  These standards provide performance standards expectations for Grade 5 to 10; however, they do not provide guidance for other grades, and the expectation for a Grade 5 and Grade 10 student are the same.

===Arab World===
{{unreferenced section|date=June 2018}}
In the Arab region, media and information literacy was largely ignored up until 2011, when the Media Studies Program at the American University of Beirut, the Open Society Foundations and the Arab-US Association for Communication Educators (AUSACE) launched a regional conference themed "New Directions: Digital and Media Literacy". The conference attracted significant attention from Arab universities and scholars, who discussed obstacles and needs to advance media literacy in the Arab region, including developing curricula in Arabic, training faculty and promoting the field. 

Following up on that recommendation, the Media Studies Program at AUB and the Open Society Foundations in collaboration with the Salzburg Academy on Media and Global Change launched in 2013 the first regional initiative to develop, vitalize, and advance media literacy education in the Arab region. The Media and Digital Literacy Academy of Beirut (MDLAB) offered an annual two-week summer training program in addition to working year-round to develop media literacy curricula and programs. The academy is conducted in Arabic and English and brings pioneering international instructors and professionals to teach advanced digital and media literacy concepts to young Arab academics and graduate students from various fields. MDLAB hopes that the participating Arab academics will carry what they learned to their countries and institutions and offers free curricular material in Arabic and English, including media literacy syllabi, lectures, exercises, lesson plans, and multi-media material, to assist and encourage the integration of digital and media literacy into Arab university and school curricula. 

In recognition of MDLAB's accomplishments in advancing media literacy education in the Arab region, the founder of MDLAB received the 2015 UNESCO-UNAOC International Media and Information Literacy Award. 

Prior to 2013, only two Arab universities offered media literacy courses: the American University of Beirut (AUB) and the American University of Sharjah (AUS). Three years after the launch of MDLAB, over two dozen Arab universities incorporated media literacy education into their curricula, both as stand-alone courses or as modules injected into their existing media courses. Among the universities who have full-fledged media literacy courses (as of 2015) are Lebanese American University (Lebanon), Birzeit University (Palestine), University of Balamand (Lebanon), Damascus University (Syria), Rafik Hariri University (Lebanon), Notre Dame University (Lebanon), Ahram Canadian University (Egypt), American University of Beirut (Lebanon), American University of Sharjah (UAE), and Al Azm University (Lebanon). The first Arab school to adopt media literacy as part of its strategic plan is the International College (IC) in Lebanon. Efforts to introduce media literacy to the region's other universities and schools continues with the help of other international organizations, such as UNESCO, UNAOC, AREACORE, DAAD, and OSF.

==Barriers==
{{unreferenced|date=June 2018|section}}
One barrier to learning to read is the lack of books, while a barrier to learning IML is the lack of technology access. Highlighting the value of IML helps to identify existing barriers within school infrastructure, staff development, and support systems.  While there is a continued need to work on the foundations to provide a sustainable and equitable access, the biggest obstacle is school climate.

Marc Prensky&lt;ref&gt;Marc Prensky 2006, para. 25&lt;/ref&gt; identifies one barrier as teachers viewing digital devices as distractions: "Let's admit the real reason that we ban cell phones is that, given the opportunity to use them, students would vote with their attention, just as adults would 'vote with their feet' by leaving the room when a presentation is not compelling."{{clarification needed|date=June 2018}}

The mindset of banning new technology, and fearing the bad things that can happen, can affect educational decisions. The decision to ban digital devices impacts students for the rest of their lives.

Any tool that is used poorly or incorrectly can be unsafe.  Safety lessons are mandatory in industrial technology and science.  Yet safety or ethical lessons are not mandatory to use technology.

Not all decisions in schools are measured by common ground beliefs.  One school district in Ontario banned digital devices from their schools.  Local schools have been looking at doing the same. These kinds of reactions are often about immediate actions and not about teaching, learning or creating solutions.  Many barriers to IML exist.

[[File:Don Rickles 1973.JPG|thumb|120px|Publicity photo of [[Don Rickles]], a well-regarded insult comedian, in 1973.]]
'''Insult comedy''' is a [[comedy]] genre in which the act consists mainly of offensive insults directed at the performer's audience or other performers.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=G2nZzPKpwjkC&amp;pg=PA167 | title=The Complete Idiot's Guide to Comedy Writing |author=James Mendrinos, Jim Mendrinos |isbn=978-1-59257-231-1 |publisher=Penguin |year=2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Typical targets for insult include individuals in the show's audience, the town hosting the performance, or the subject of a [[Roast (comedy)|roast]]. An insult comedian often maintains a competitive and interactive relationship with his or her audience. The style has been described as "festive abuse".

The style can be distinguished from an act based on satire, or political humor. Insult comedy is often used to deflect or silence [[heckler]]s even when the rest of the show is not focused around it.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4736">'''Kavka's toxin puzzle''' is a [[thought experiment]] about the possibility of forming an intention to perform an act which, following from reason, is an action one would not actually perform. It was presented by moral and political philosopher [[Gregory S. Kavka]] in "The Toxin Puzzle" (1983), and grew out of his work in [[deterrence theory]] and [[mutual assured destruction]].

==The puzzle==
Kavka's original version of the puzzle is the following:
&lt;blockquote&gt;''An eccentric billionaire places before you a vial of toxin that, if you drink it, will make you painfully ill for a day, but will not threaten your life or have any lasting effects. The billionaire will pay you one million dollars tomorrow morning if, at midnight tonight, you ''intend'' to drink the toxin tomorrow afternoon. He emphasizes that you need not drink the toxin to receive the money; in fact, the money will already be in your bank account hours before the time for drinking it arrives, if you succeed. All you have to do is. . . intend at midnight tonight to drink the stuff tomorrow afternoon. You are perfectly free to change your mind after receiving the money and not drink the toxin.''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |pages=33–36 [pp. 33–34] |last=Kavka |first=Gregory |title=The Toxin Puzzle |journal=[[Analysis (journal)|Analysis]] |volume=43 |issue=1 |year=1983 |jstor= |doi=10.1093/analys/43.1.33 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

A possible interpretation: Can you intend to drink the toxin if you also intend to change your mind at a later time?

==The paradox==
The paradoxical nature can be stated in many ways, which may be useful for understanding analysis proposed by philosophers:
* In line with [[Newcomb's paradox]], an [[omniscient]] pay-off mechanism makes a person's decision known to him before he makes the decision, but it is  also assumed that the person may change his decision afterwards, of [[free will]].
* Similarly in line with Newcomb's paradox; Kavka's claim, that one cannot intend what one will not do, makes pay-off mechanism an example of [[retrocausality|reverse causation]].
* Pay-off for decision to drink the poison is ambiguous.
* There are two decisions for one event with different pay-offs.

Since the pain caused by the poison would be more than off-set by the money received, we can sketch the pay-off table as follows.
{| class="wikitable"
|+Pay-offs (Initial analysis)
|-
! !!Intend
! Do not intend
|-
! Drink
| 90
| −10
|-
! Do not drink
| 100
| 0
|}

According to Kavka: Drinking the poison is never to your advantage regardless of whether you are paid. A rational person would know he would not drink the poison and thus could not intend to drink it.
{| class="wikitable"
|+Pay-offs (According to Kavka)
|-
! !!Intend
! Do not intend
|-
! Drink
| Impossible
| −10
|-
! Do not drink
| Impossible
| 0
|}

[[David Gauthier]] argues once a person intends drinking the poison one cannot entertain ideas of not drinking it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Gauthier |first=David |title=Assure and Threaten |journal=[[Ethics (journal)|Ethics]] |volume=104 |issue=4 |year=1994 |pages=690–721 |jstor=2382214 |doi=10.1086/293651}}&lt;/ref&gt;
::''The rational outcome of your deliberation tomorrow morning is the action that will be part of your life going as well as possible, subject to the constraint that it be compatible with your commitment---in  this case, compatible with the sincere intention that you form today to drink the toxin. And so the rational action is to drink the toxin.''
{| class="wikitable"
|+Pay-offs (According to Gauthier)
|-
! !!Intend
! Do not intend
|-
! Drink
| 90
| −10
|-
! Do not drink
| Impossible
| 0
|}

One of the central tenets of the puzzle is that for a reasonable person
* There is reasonable grounds for that person to intend to drink the toxin, since some reward may be obtained.
* Having come to the above conclusion there is no reasonable grounds for that person to drink the toxin, since no further reward may be obtained, and no reasonable person would partake in self-harm for no benefit.

Thus a reasonable person must intend to drink the toxin by the first argument, yet if that person intends to drink the toxin, he is being irrational by the second argument.

The '''[[law]] of [[Europe]]''' is diverse and changing fast today. Europe saw the birth of both the [[Roman Empire]] and the [[British Empire]], which form the basis of the two dominant forms of legal system of private law, [[civil law (legal system)|civil]] and [[common law]].

==History==
[[Image:Code Civil 1804.png|thumb|right|150px|First page of the 1804 edition of the [[Napoleonic Code]].]]
The law of Europe has a diverse history. [[Roman law]] underwent major codification in the [[Corpus Juris Civilis]] of Emperor [[Justinian I|Justinian]], as later developed through the [[Middle Ages]] by medieval legal scholars. In [[Medieval]] [[England]], judges retained greater power than their continental counterparts and began to develop a body of precedent. Originally civil law was one common legal system in much of [[Europe]], but with the rise of [[nationalism]] in the 17th century [[Nordic countries]] and around the time of the [[French Revolution]], it became fractured into separate national systems. This change was brought about by the development of separate national codes, of which the French [[Napoleonic Code]] and the [[Bürgerliches Gesetzbuch|German]] and [[Swiss Civil Code|Swiss codes]] were the most influential. Around this time civil law incorporated many ideas associated with the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]]. The [[European Union]]'s Law is based on a codified set of laws, laid down in the [[European Union Law|Treaties]]. Law in the EU is however mixed with precedent in case law of the [[European Court of Justice]]. In accordance with its history, the interpretation of European law relies less on policy considerations than U.S. law.&lt;ref&gt;[[Kristoffel Grechenig]] &amp; Martin Gelter, The Transatlantic Divergence in Legal Thought: American Law and Economics vs. German Doctrinalism, [http://ssrn.com/abstract=1161168 ''Hastings International and Comparative Law Review 2008, vol. 31, p. 295-360'']; Martin Gelter &amp; [[Kristoffel Grechenig]], [http://ssrn.com/abstract=2421224 ''History of Law and Economics''], forthcoming in Encyclopedia on Law &amp; Economics.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10371">In [[mathematics]], '''log-polar coordinates''' (or '''logarithmic polar coordinates''') is a [[coordinate system]] in two dimensions, where a point is identified by two numbers, one for the [[logarithm]] of the distance to a certain point, and one for an [[angle]]. Log-polar coordinates are closely connected to [[polar coordinates]], which are usually used to describe domains in the plane with some sort of [[rotational symmetry]]. In areas like [[Harmonic analysis|harmonic]] and [[complex analysis]], the log-polar coordinates are more canonical than polar coordinates.

''Log-polar coordinates'' in the plane consist of a pair of real numbers (ρ,θ), where ρ is the logarithm of the distance between a given point and the [[origin (mathematics)|origin]] and θ is the angle between a line of reference (the ''x''-axis) and the line through the origin and the point. The angular coordinate is the same as for polar coordinates, while the radial coordinate is transformed according to the rule

:&lt;math&gt; r = e^\rho. &lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt; r &lt;/math&gt; is the distance to the origin. The formulas for transformation from [[Cartesian coordinates]] to log-polar coordinates are given by

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{cases} \rho = \log\sqrt{ x^2 + y^2}, \\ \theta = \arctan y/x \hbox{ if }x&gt;0.  \end{cases}&lt;/math&gt;

and the formulas for transformation from log-polar to Cartesian coordinates are

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{cases}x = e^\rho\cos\theta, \\ y = e^\rho\sin\theta.\end{cases}&lt;/math&gt;

By using complex numbers (''x'',&amp;nbsp;''y'')&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''x''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;''iy'', the latter transformation can be written as
 
:&lt;math&gt; x + iy = e^{\rho+i\theta} &lt;/math&gt;

i.e. the complex exponential function. From this follows that basic equations in harmonic and complex analysis will have the same simple form as in Cartesian coordinates. This is not the case for polar coordinates.

== Some important equations in log-polar coordinates ==
=== Laplace's equation ===

[[Laplace's equation]] in two dimensions is given by

:&lt;math&gt; \frac{\partial^2 u}{\partial x^2} + \frac{\partial^2 u}{\partial y^2} = 0&lt;/math&gt;

in Cartesian coordinates. Writing the same equation in polar coordinates gives the more complicated equation

:&lt;math&gt; r\frac{\partial}{\partial r}\left(r\frac{\partial u}{\partial r}\right) + \frac{\partial^2 u}{\partial \theta^2} = 0&lt;/math&gt;

or equivalently

:&lt;math&gt; \left(r\frac{\partial}{\partial r}\right)^2 u + \frac{\partial^2 u}{\partial \theta^2} = 0&lt;/math&gt;

However, from the relation &lt;math&gt; r = e^\rho &lt;/math&gt; it follows that &lt;math&gt; r\frac{\partial}{\partial r} = \frac{\partial}{\partial \rho}&lt;/math&gt; so Laplace's equation in log-polar coordinates,
 
:&lt;math&gt; \frac{\partial^2 u}{\partial \rho^2} + \frac{\partial^2 u}{\partial \theta^2} = 0&lt;/math&gt;

has the same simple expression as in Cartesian coordinates. This is true for all coordinate systems where the transformation to Cartesian coordinates is given by a [[conformal mapping]]. Thus, when considering Laplace's equation for a part of the plane with rotational symmetry, e.g. a circular disk, log-polar coordinates is the natural choice.

=== Cauchy&amp;ndash;Riemann equations ===

A similar situation arises when considering [[analytical function]]s. An analytical function &lt;math&gt; f(x,y) = u(x,y) + iv(x,y)&lt;/math&gt; written in Cartesian coordinates satisfies the Cauchy&amp;ndash;Riemann equations:
:&lt;math&gt; \frac{\partial u}{\partial x} = \frac{\partial v}{\partial y},\ \ \ \ \ \ \frac{\partial u}{\partial y} = -\frac{\partial v}{\partial x}&lt;/math&gt;

If the function instead is expressed in polar form &lt;math&gt;f(re^{i\theta})=Re^{i\Phi}&lt;/math&gt;, the Cauchy&amp;ndash;Riemann equations take the more complicated form

:&lt;math&gt; r\frac{\partial \log R}{\partial r} = \frac{\partial \Phi}{\partial \theta},\ \ \ \ \ \ \frac{\partial \log R}{\partial \theta} = -r\frac{\partial \Phi}{\partial r},&lt;/math&gt;

Just as in the case with Laplace's equation, the simple form of Cartesian coordinates is recovered by changing polar into log-polar coordinates (let &lt;math&gt; P = \log R &lt;/math&gt;):

:&lt;math&gt; \frac{\partial P}{\partial \rho} = \frac{\partial \Phi}{\partial \theta},\ \ \ \ \ \ \frac{\partial P}{\partial \theta} = -\frac{\partial \Phi}{\partial \rho}&lt;/math&gt;

The Cauchy&amp;ndash;Riemann equations can also be written in one single equation as

:&lt;math&gt; \left(\frac{\partial}{\partial x} + i\frac{\partial}{\partial y}\right)f(x+iy) = 0 &lt;/math&gt;

By expressing &lt;math&gt;\frac{\partial}{\partial x}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\frac{\partial}{\partial y}&lt;/math&gt; in terms of &lt;math&gt;\frac{\partial}{\partial \rho}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\frac{\partial}{\partial \theta}&lt;/math&gt; this equation can be written in the equivalent form

:&lt;math&gt; \left(\frac{\partial}{\partial \rho} + i\frac{\partial}{\partial \theta}\right)f(e^{\rho + i\theta}) = 0 &lt;/math&gt;

=== Euler's equation ===

When one wants to solve the Dirichlet problem in a domain with rotational symmetry, the usual thing to do is to use the method of separation of variables for partial differential equations for Laplace's equation in polar form. This means that you write &lt;math&gt;u(r,\theta)=R(r)\Theta(\theta)&lt;/math&gt;. Laplace's equation is then separated into two ordinary differential equations

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{cases}  \Theta''(\theta) + \nu^2\Theta(\theta) = 0\\ r^2R''(r) + rR'(r)-\nu^2 R(r) = 0 \end{cases}&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\nu &lt;/math&gt; is a constant. The first of these has constant coefficients and is easily solved. The second is a special case of Euler's equation

:&lt;math&gt; r^2R''(r) + c rR'(r) + d R(r) = 0 &lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;c, d &lt;/math&gt; are constants. This equation is usually solved by the ansatz &lt;math&gt;R(r) = r^{\lambda}&lt;/math&gt;, but through use of log-polar radius, it can be changed into an equation with constant coefficients:

:&lt;math&gt; P''(\rho) + (c-1) P'(\rho) + d P(\rho) = 0 &lt;/math&gt;

When considering Laplace's equation, &lt;math&gt;c = 1&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt; d = -\nu^2 &lt;/math&gt; so the equation for &lt;math&gt; r &lt;/math&gt; takes the simple form

:&lt;math&gt; P''(\rho) - \nu^2 P(\rho) = 0 &lt;/math&gt;

When solving the Dirichlet problem in Cartesian coordinates, these are exactly the equations for 
&lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt;. Thus, once again the natural choice for a domain with rotational symmetry is not polar, but rather log-polar, coordinates.

== Discrete geometry ==

[[Image:logpolargrid.jpg|thumb|Discrete coordinate system in a circular disc given by log-polar coordinates (''n''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;25)]]

[[Image:logspiralgrid.png|thumb|Discrete coordinate system in a circular disc that can easily be expressed in log-polar coordinates (''n''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;25)]]

[[File:Mandelbrotzoom1.jpg|thumb|Part of a Mandelbrot fractal showing spiral behaviour]]

In order to solve a PDE numerically in a domain, a discrete coordinate system must be introduced in this domain. If the domain has rotational symmetry and you want a grid consisting of rectangles, polar coordinates are a poor choice, since in the center of the circle it gives rise to triangles rather than rectangles. However, this can be remedied by introducing log-polar coordinates in the following way. Divide the plane into a grid of squares with side length 2&lt;math&gt;\pi&lt;/math&gt;/''n'', where ''n'' is a positive integer. Use the complex exponential function to create a log-polar grid in the plane. The left half-plane is then mapped onto the unit disc, with the number of radii equal to&amp;nbsp;''n''. It can be even more advantageous to instead map the diagonals in these squares, which gives a discrete coordinate system in the unit disc consisting of spirals, see the figure to the right.

=== Dirichlet-to-Neumann operator ===

The latter coordinate system is for instance suitable for dealing with Dirichlet and Neumann problems. If the discrete coordinate system is interpreted as an undirected graph in the unit disc, it can be considered as a model for an electrical network. To every line segment in the graph is associated a conductance given by a function &lt;math&gt; \gamma &lt;/math&gt;. The electrical network will then serve as a discrete model for the Dirichlet problem in the unit disc, where the Laplace equation takes the form of Kirchhoff's law. On the nodes on the boundary of the circle, an electrical potential (Dirichlet data) is defined, which induces an electric current (Neumann data) through the boundary nodes. The linear operator &lt;math&gt; \Lambda_\gamma &lt;/math&gt;  from Dirichlet data to Neumann data is called a [[Dirichlet-to-Neumann operator]], and depends on the topology and conductance of the network.

In the case with the continuous disc, it follows that if the conductance is homogeneous, let's say &lt;math&gt; \gamma = 1 &lt;/math&gt; everywhere, then the [[Dirichlet-to-Neumann operator]] satisfies the following equation

:&lt;math&gt; \Lambda_\gamma^2 + \frac{\partial^2\ }{\partial\theta^2} = 0 &lt;/math&gt;

In order to get a good discrete model of the Dirichlet problem, it would be useful to find a graph in the unit disc whose (discrete) Dirichlet-to-Neumann operator has the same property. Even though polar coordinates don't give us any answer, this is approximate/assymptoticaly, what the rotationally symmetric network given by log-polar coordinates provides us with.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.academia.edu/19660770/On_square_root_of_minus_Laplacian&lt;/ref&gt;

===Image analysis===

Already at the end of the 1970s, applications for the discrete spiral coordinate system were given in image analysis. To represent an image in this coordinate system rather than in Cartesian coordinates, gives computational advantages when rotating or zooming in an image. Also, the photo receptors in the retina in the human eye are distributed in a way that has big similarities with the spiral coordinate system.&lt;ref&gt;Weiman, Chaikin, ''Logarithmic Spiral Grids for Image Processing and Display'', Computer Graphics and Image Processing 11, 197&amp;ndash;226 (1979).&lt;/ref&gt; It can also be found in the Mandelbrot fractal (see picture to the right).

Log-polar coordinates can also be used to construct fast methods for the Radon transform and its inverse. &lt;ref&gt;Andersson, Fredrik, ''Fast Inversion of the Radon Transform Using Log-polar Coordinates and Partial Back-Projections'', SIAM J. Appl. Math. 65, 818&amp;ndash;837 (2005).&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Louise Bryant''' (December 5, 1885 – January 6, 1936) was an American [[feminist]], [[political activist]], and [[journalist]] best known for her sympathetic coverage of Russia and the [[Bolsheviks]] during the [[Russian Revolution]]. Bryant, who married fellow journalist [[John Reed (journalist)|John Reed]] (her second husband) in 1916, wrote about Russian leaders such as [[Catherine Breshkovsky|Katherine Breshkovsky]], [[Maria Spiridonova]], [[Alexander Kerensky]], [[Vladimir Lenin]], and [[Leon Trotsky]]. Her news stories, distributed by [[Hearst Corporation|Hearst]] during and after her trips to [[Saint Petersburg|Petrograd]] and Moscow, appeared in newspapers across the United States and Canada in the years immediately following [[World War I]]. A collection of articles from her first trip was published in 1918 as ''Six Red Months in Russia''. Over the next year, she defended the revolution in testimony before the [[Overman Committee]], a [[U.S. Senate|Senate]] subcommittee established to investigate Bolshevik influence in the United States. Later in 1919, she undertook a nationwide speaking tour to encourage public support of the Bolsheviks and to denounce [[Allied intervention in the Russian Civil War|armed U.S. intervention in Russia]].

Born Anna Louise Mohan, as a young girl she began using the last name of her stepfather, Sheridan Bryant, in preference to that of her father. She grew up in rural [[Nevada]] and attended the [[University of Nevada, Reno|University of Nevada]] in [[Reno, Nevada|Reno]] and the [[University of Oregon]] in [[Eugene, Oregon|Eugene]], graduating with a degree in history in 1909. Pursuing a career in journalism, she became society editor of the ''Spectator'' and [[freelancer|freelanced]] for ''[[The Oregonian]]'', newspapers in [[Portland, Oregon]]. During her years in that city (1909–1915), she became active in the [[Women's suffrage in the United States|women's suffrage]] movement. Leaving her first husband in 1915 to follow Reed to [[Greenwich Village]], she formed friendships with leading feminists of the day, some of whom she met through Reed's associates at publications such as ''The Masses''; at meetings of a women's group, [[Heterodoxy (group)|Heterodoxy]]; and through work with the [[Provincetown Players]]. During a [[National Woman's Party]] suffrage rally in [[Washington, D.C.]], in 1919, she was arrested and spent three days in jail. Both she and Reed took lovers outside marriage; during her Greenwich Village years (1916–1920) for her these included the playwright [[Eugene O'Neill]] and the painter [[Andrew Dasburg]].

After Reed's death from [[typhus]] in 1920, Bryant continued to write for Hearst about Russia and also about Turkey, Hungary, Greece, Italy, and other countries in Europe and the Middle East. Some articles from this period were collected in 1923 under the title ''Mirrors of Moscow''. Later that year she married [[William Christian Bullitt Jr.|William C. Bullitt, Jr.]], with whom she had her only child, [[Anne Moen Bullitt|Anne]], the following year. Suffering in her later years from the rare and painful disorder [[adiposis dolorosa]], Bryant did little writing or publishing in her last decade, and drank heavily. Bullitt, winning sole custody of Anne, divorced Bryant in 1930. Bryant died in Paris in 1936 and was buried in [[Versailles (city)|Versailles]]. In 1998, a group from Portland restored her grave, which had become neglected.

==Early life==
Anna Louise Mohan was born in 1885 in [[San Francisco]], California.{{sfn|Dearborn|1996|p=9}} Her father, Hugh Mohan, born in [[Pennsylvania]], became a journalist and [[Stump speech (politics)|stump speaker]] involved in labor issues and [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]] politics.{{sfn|Dearborn|1996|pp=10–11}} Moving to San Francisco, he continued to write for newspapers, and in 1880 he married Louisa Flick, who grew up on the ranch of her stepfather, James Say, near [[Lake Humboldt|Humboldt Lake]] in [[Nevada]]. The Mohans had two children, Barbara (1880) and Louis (1882), before the birth of Anna Louise.{{sfn|Dearborn|1996|pp=10–11}} Later in 1885, the family moved to [[Reno, Nevada|Reno]], where Mohan continued his journalistic career but drank heavily. One day he departed and never returned to his wife and children. Louise's mother divorced him in 1889 and married Sheridan Bryant, a freight conductor on the [[Southern Pacific]] railway.{{sfn|Dearborn|1996|pp=12–17}} The couple had two children, Floyd (1894) and William (1896).{{sfn|Dearborn|1996|pp=12–17}} Although the family lived in [[Wadsworth, Nevada]], Louise accepted an invitation from James Say to live at his ranch. She remained there for three or four years, returning to Wadsworth at her mother's insistence at the age of 12.{{sfn|Dearborn|1996|pp=12–17}} Bryant adopted her stepfather's last name,{{sfn|Dearborn|1996|p=15}} but never changed it legally from Mohan.{{sfn|Gelb|1973|p=37}}

Attending high school in Wadsworth and Reno and college at [[Nevada State University]] (now known as the University of Nevada, Reno), Bryant developed interests in journalism, debate, illustration, social life, dancing, and basketball.{{sfn|Dearborn|1996|pp=12–17}} She edited the "Young Ladies Edition" of the ''Student Record'' in 1905, wrote a short story, "The Way of a Flirt", for a literary magazine, ''Chuckwalla'', and contributed sketches to it and another publication, ''Artemisia''.{{sfn|Gardner|1982|pp=22–24}} Depressed after the death of her step-grandfather in 1906, Bryant left school for a job in [[Jolon, California]], where for a few months she boarded at a cattle ranch and taught children, mostly young Mexicans.{{sfn|Dearborn|1996|pp=12–17}}  That summer she moved to [[Eugene, Oregon]], where her brother Louis worked for the [[Southern Pacific Transportation Company|Southern Pacific]].{{sfn|Dearborn|1996|p=18}}

After learning that she could transfer her college credits from Nevada, she enrolled at the [[University of Oregon]], in Eugene.{{sfn|Gardner|1982|pp=22–23}} Popular at the school, which then had a total student enrollment of less than 500,{{sfn|Gardner|1982|pp=22–23}} she helped start a small [[sorority]], Zeta Iota Phi (a chapter of [[Chi Omega]]),{{sfn|Dearborn|1996|p=19}} and served as its first president.{{sfn|Gardner|1982|pp=22–23}} During her time in Eugene, she produced poems and pen-and-ink sketches for the ''Oregon Monthly''.{{sfn|Gardner|1982|pp=22–23}} In a small city steeped in "puritan moralism",{{sfn|Gardner|1982|pp=22–23}} she was the first to wear [[Rouge (cosmetics)|rouge]] on campus; she had multiple boyfriends, and she wore clothes that [[Miriam Van Waters]], the editor of the ''Oregon Monthly'', and [[Luella Clay Carson]], the [[dean of women]], considered improper.{{sfn|Gardner|1982|pp=22–24}} Taking off the spring semester of 1908 to teach in a one-room schoolhouse on [[Stuart Island (Washington)|Stuart Island]], one of the [[San Juan Islands]] near the U.S. border with Canada, she returned to Eugene to finish her bachelor's degree in history, graduating in early 1909. Her senior thesis was on the [[Modoc War|Modoc Indian Wars]].{{sfn|Dearborn|1996|pp=18–22}}

==Portland==
In the spring of 1909, Bryant moved to Portland, first sharing a downtown apartment with one of her college friends, Clara Wold, then renting her own apartment in the same building.{{sfn|Dearborn|1996|pp=22–27}} Among her jobs, she designed a stained-glass window for the [[Povey Brothers Studio|Povey Brothers]],{{sfn|Dearborn|1996|pp=22–27}} worked as a freelance reporter for ''[[The Oregonian]]'',&lt;ref name="Oregonian freelance"&gt;{{cite news|last=Perry|first=Douglas|title=Women's History Month: Revisiting Louise Bryant's Portland|newspaper=The Oregonian|location=Portland, Oregon|url=http://www.oregonlive.com/portland/index.ssf/2011/03/national_womens_history_month.html|date=March 1, 2011|access-date=February 3, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; and became an illustrator and society editor for the ''Portland Spectator'',{{sfn|Dearborn|1996|pp=22–27}} a weekly news magazine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Elbert Bede Will Edit 'Portland Spectator'|newspaper=Corvallis Gazette–Times|url=https://www.newspapers.com/image/140874802/?terms=%22Portland%2BSpectator%22|date=January 15, 1938|page=1|via=Newspapers.com|subscription=yes|access-date=October 6, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Meanwhile, she formed friendships with people—such as Cas Baer, drama editor for ''The Oregonian''—who were interested in journalism and the arts.{{sfn|Dearborn|1996|pp=22–27}} In late 1909, she met and married Paul Trullinger, a dentist who lived on a houseboat on the [[Willamette River]], collected art, and liked drinking parties that sometimes included invitations to his office to inhale [[ether]].{{sfn|Dearborn|1996|pp=22–27}}

Bryant, who retained her maiden name and her downtown apartment after her marriage to Trullinger, bridled at doing housework and yearned for professional advancement. Drawn toward politics and the [[Women's suffrage in the United States|women's suffrage movement]] by her friend [[Sara Bard Field]], she joined the Oregon branch of the [[College Equal Suffrage League]] in 1912. She and Field gave pro-suffrage speeches in smaller Oregon cities, and Bryant rode on the suffrage float in Portland's annual [[Flag Day (United States)|Flag Day]] parade. Led by [[Abigail Scott Duniway]], women achieved suffrage in Oregon later that year.{{sfn|Dearborn|1996|pp=27–29}}

Bryant became familiar with the [[socialist]] journal ''[[The Masses]]'' through Portland resident and lawyer [[Charles Erskine Scott Wood|C. E. S. Wood]], who eventually married Field and who often contributed to the magazine.{{sfn|Gardner|1982|pp=25–29}} Enthusiastic about its contents, particularly articles by Portland native [[John Reed (journalist)|John Reed]], Bryant began raising subscriptions for it.{{sfn|Dearborn|1996|pp=36–37}} [[Emma Goldman]], a well-known [[Anarchism|anarchist]] whom Wood had defended in court,{{sfn|Gardner|1982|pp=25–29}} gave a speech in Reed's honor at the [[Industrial Workers of the World]] (IWW) hall in Portland.{{sfn|Dearborn|1996|pp=36–37}} She and other political activists, such as [[Alexander Berkman]], were among guests entertained by Bryant and her husband.&lt;ref name="Oregon Encyclopedia"&gt;{{cite web|last=Munk|first=Michael|title=Louise Bryant (1885–1936)|publisher=Portland State University|work=The Oregon Encyclopedia|url=http://www.oregonencyclopedia.org/articles/bryant_louise_1885_1936_//|accessdate=May 19, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1914, Reed, a [[Harvard University|Harvard]] graduate and established writer who by then lived in [[Greenwich Village]], came home for a visit, during which he spoke at the [[University Club (Portland, Oregon)|University Club]] of Portland against the [[Social class|class system]].{{sfn|Dearborn|1996|pp=36–37}} Exactly how or when or how often Bryant and Reed met is uncertain, but near Christmas 1915 when Reed again came home to visit his widowed mother, the young couple announced their love at a dinner party.{{sfn|Dearborn|1996|pp=37–40}} Reed returned to Greenwich Village on December 28, and Bryant, abandoning her marriage, followed him three days later.&lt;ref name="Oregon Encyclopedia"/&gt; Trullinger filed for divorce, which was granted in July 1916, on grounds of desertion.{{sfn|Gelb|1973|p=104}}{{sfn|Dearborn|1996|p=56}}

==Greenwich Village and Cape Cod==
[[File:John Reed journalist.jpg|thumb|alt=Mid-length photograph of a man of about 25 in a jacket, tie, and fedora.|[[John Reed (journalist)|John Reed]], {{Circa|1910–1915}}]] Reed had rented a room for Bryant near his apartment at 43 Washington Square.{{sfn|Dearborn|1996|p=43}} Their unmarried co-habitation caused little curiosity among Reed's friends in the Village, many of whom rejected marriage and other middle-class norms.{{sfn|Gelb|1973|pp=76–77}} Unified by an "air of intellectual freedom, moral laissez-faire and camaraderie", most were involved in literary, artistic, or political pursuits in a [[Bohemianism|Bohemian]] neighborhood that in some ways resembled the [[Rive Gauche (Paris)|Left Bank]] of Paris.{{sfn|Gelb|1973|pp=76–77}} While visiting New York, Field took Bryant to a meeting of [[Heterodoxy (group)|Heterodoxy]], a women's group that included [[feminist]] [[Charlotte Perkins Gilman]], journalist [[Mary Heaton Vorse]], [[political activist]] [[Crystal Eastman]], actress [[Ida Rauh]], writers [[Zona Gale]] and [[Mary Austin]], and many others.{{sfn|Dearborn|1996|p=44}} Among Bryant's new friends were feminists [[Inez Milholland]], [[Inez Haynes Irwin|Inez Gillmore]], and [[Doris Stevens]].{{sfn|Gardner|1982|p=16}} Other notables circulating in the Village included Emma Goldman, playwright [[Eugene O'Neill]], and one of Reed's former lovers, arts patron [[Mabel Dodge Luhan|Mabel Dodge]].{{sfn|Gelb|1973|pp=78–79}}

At Number 43, Bryant and Reed pursued their journalistic endeavors in separate work rooms.{{sfn|Gardner|1982|p=14}} Four months after leaving Oregon, Bryant broke into print in New York with an article about two Portland judges, one of whom had dismissed a case brought against Goldman for distributing [[Birth control movement in the United States|birth-control information]]. It was published as "Two Judges" in the April 1916 issue of ''The Masses'', edited by [[Max Eastman]], Crystal Eastman's brother.&lt;ref name="Two Judges"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Bryant|first=Louise|title=Two Judges|url=http://dlib.nyu.edu/themasses/books/masses060/18|journal=The Masses|publisher=The Masses Publishing Company|location=New York|via=New York University|date=April 1916|volume=8|number=6|page=18|accessdate=January 24, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Meanwhile, Reed, who had reported on the [[1913 Paterson silk strike]], [[Pancho Villa]] in 1913–14, and the ongoing war (World War I) in Europe,{{sfn|Gelb|1973|pp=44–75}} went on assignment for ''[[Collier's]]'' to interview [[William Jennings Bryan]] in Florida.{{sfn|Gelb|1973|pp=80–81}}

Later that spring Bryant and Reed heeded Vorse's call to spend the warm season in [[Provincetown, Massachusetts]], at the tip of [[Cape Cod]], and to take part in the communal theater productions of the [[Provincetown Players]]. Others from the Village went as well and joined the group, organized in 1915 by [[George Cram Cook]] and his wife, [[Susan Glaspell]], who hoped to produce plays that were both political and artistic. Among the works the group staged in 1916 were Bryant's ''The Game'', in which characters named Life and Death play dice for the lives of Youth (a poet) and Girl (a dancer). It appeared on the same bill as ''Not Smart'' by [[Wilbur Daniel Steele|Wilbur Steele]] and ''Bound East for Cardiff'' by O'Neill.{{sfn|Dearborn|1996|pp=47–52}}

During the summer, Reed left Cape Cod to cover the [[Progressive Party (United States, 1912)|Progressive Party]] convention in Chicago, and at other times he retreated from the players to work on articles for ''Collier's'' and ''[[Metropolitan Magazine (New York)|Metropolitan Magazine]]''. During these absences, Bryant and O'Neill became lovers, not surprising in a group that professed and practiced [[free love]].{{sfn|Dearborn|1996|p=52}} Reed, made aware of this new development, responded by inviting O'Neill to begin taking his meals with them.{{sfn|Dearborn|1996|pp=53–54}} In a note to Field, Bryant said that her relationship with Reed was "so beautiful and so free!... We don't ''interfere'' with each other at all...we feel like children who will never grow up."{{sfn|Dearborn|1996|pp=55–56}}

==Croton-on-Hudson==

Death holds a long stick from which dangles a carrot just out of reach of the skinny donkey. The carrot is labeled "Victory".| "Europe 1916", an anti-war cartoon by [[Boardman Robinson]], appeared in the October 1916 issue of ''The Masses'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Robinson|first=Boardman|title=Europe 1916|url=http://dlib.nyu.edu/themasses/books/masses066/19|journal=The Masses|publisher=The Masses Publishing Company|location=New York|via=New York University|date=October 1916|volume=8|number=12|pages=18–19|accessdate=February 3, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; a magazine for which Bryant had begun writing articles and poems that same year.]] After spending the month of September 1916 in a cottage they bought in [[Truro, Massachusetts|Truro]], Bryant and Reed returned to Greenwich Village, where the Provincetown Players planned to establish an alternative to [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] theater. On weekends, they sojourned to [[Croton-on-Hudson, New York|Croton-on-Hudson]], upriver from New York City, where Villagers including Eastman, Dodge, and illustrator [[Boardman Robinson]] and his wife had cottages. In October, Bryant and Reed bought their own place in Croton-on-Hudson. Meanwhile, Reed, who had suffered from kidney ailments since childhood, was told by his doctors that he would need to have a kidney removed. The surgery, considered "gravely serious", was scheduled for mid-November. Reed wanted to protect Bryant by making her his legal heir,{{sfn|Dearborn|1996|pp=58–59}} and they married on November 9 at the county clerk's office in [[Peekskill, New York|Peekskill]] before Reed left on November 12 for surgery at [[Johns Hopkins Hospital]] in Baltimore.{{sfn|Gardner|1982|pp=48–49}}

Compounding their difficulties were Bryant's ongoing relationship with O'Neill and gynecological problems she was treated for while Reed was in the hospital.{{sfn|Dearborn|1996|pp=60–62}} When he returned from Baltimore in mid-December, Reed and Bryant retreated full-time to Croton-on-Hudson to recuperate and to focus on writing. They made plans to travel to China in 1917 to cover events for American publications, but in January the plans fell through when U.S. entry into [[World War I]] against Germany became highly likely.{{sfn|Gardner|1982|p=62}} (The U.S. entered the war on April 6.){{sfn|Dearborn|1996|p=64}} To boost their finances, they sold the cottage in Truro to [[Margaret Sanger]], and Reed pawned his father's gold watch.{{sfn|Dearborn|1996|p=64}} At the same time, his strong anti-war positions, enunciated in ''The Masses'' and elsewhere, alienated most of his employers, further reducing his income.{{sfn|Dearborn|1996|p=64}} Adding to these stresses was Reed's confession to Bryant that he had had multiple love affairs, and the subsequent unhappiness between Bryant and Reed led to a temporary separation. When she expressed a desire to go to Europe, he helped her convince [[John Neville Wheeler|John N. Wheeler]], who had recently formed the [[Bell Syndicate]], to issue her a [[press pass]].{{sfn|Dearborn|1996|p=65–67}} Reed paid for her passage,{{sfn|Gelb|1973|p=123}} and Bryant set sail in June to cover the war in France.{{sfn|Dearborn|1996|p=65–67}} Regrets quickly followed. According to Bryant biographer Virginia Gardner:

&lt;blockquote&gt;No sooner had they parted on board the ship than both Reed and Bryant were assailed by misgivings. An outpouring of letters from either side of the Atlantic followed. Both were suffering, both were confused, lonely, and miserable... [The letters were] proof of the basically strong bond that held the two, the poet-reporter and social critic and the erratic, appealing woman he had rescued from the banality of middle-class existence in Portland.{{sfn|Gardner|1982|p=68}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;

On the voyage across the Atlantic, Bryant interviewed ambulance-service troops and others on board the ''Espagne'' and wrote news stories about them and about the threat of [[torpedo]] attacks. When she arrived in Paris, Bryant tried for several weeks to obtain permission from French authorities to visit the [[Western Front (World War I)|Western Front]], but could not do so because of her limited journalistic experience and her sex.{{sfn|Gelb|1973|p=136}} She ended up collecting information about the war from as many sources as she could meet in Paris, and sent her news stories to Reed, who edited them and forwarded them to Wheeler.{{sfn|Dearborn|1996|pp=67–70}}

==Petrograd==
[[File:Breshkovskaya.jpg|upright=0.8|thumb|right|alt=A grandmotherly woman of about 70 is seated, pen in hand, at a desk with a writing pad.|[[Catherine Breshkovsky|Katherine Breshkovsky]], "grandmother of the revolution", was among the women Bryant interviewed in 1917.]] In mid-August, when Bryant returned from France, Reed met her at the dock and told her to prepare to go to [[Saint Petersburg|Petrograd]] four days later to cover the [[Russian Revolution]]. Eastman of ''The Masses'' had raised funds to pay Reed's travel expenses, and the Bell Syndicate assigned Bryant to report on the war "from a woman's point of view". Leaving New York on August 17, they arrived in Petrograd, which was then the capital of Russia, about six months after the forced abdication of the last Russian [[czar]], [[Nicholas II of Russia|Nicholas II]]. Headed by [[Alexander Kerensky]], the provisional government that had succeeded the czar had already survived an attempted [[coup d'etat|putsch]] by Major General [[Lavr Kornilov]]. Bryant and Reed entered the city after the [[Kornilov Affair]] and before the [[Bolsheviks]] overthrew the Kerensky government in the [[October Revolution]].{{sfn|Dearborn|1996|pp=74–88}}

Reconciled as a couple, and working from their room at the [[Angleterre Hotel]], Bryant and Reed attended gatherings at the [[Smolny Institute]] and elsewhere in Petrograd and interviewed many leading political figures, including [[Lenin]], [[Trotsky]], and Kerensky, and both eventually compiled books—''Six Red Months in Russia'' by Bryant and Reed's ''Ten Days That Shook the World''—from their articles. Bryant circulated widely, covering [[Duma]] meetings, dining in public mess halls with soldiers and workers, and interviewing women revolutionaries. Among those were [[Catherine Breshkovsky|Katherine Breshkovsky]], known as the "grandmother of the revolution", [[Maria Spiridonova]], whom Bryant considered the most powerful woman in Russia, and [[Aleksandra Kollontai]], who became People's Commissar of Social Welfare and the only woman in the Bolshevik cabinet. In the process, Bryant, who had often been overshadowed by her more famous husband, gained confidence in her professional reporting skills.{{sfn|Gardner|1982|pp=81–96}} By the time she returned to New York, her work was being read across North America. Gardner says:

&lt;blockquote&gt;[The] springtime of 1918 in the United States was a time of heightened contradictions. Openmindedness about the new Russian experiment in cities and the hinterland coexisted with the intensified patriotism of wartime... No matter what appeared in their editorial pages, newspaper editors knew that feature stories with first-hand knowledge of the Revolution sold papers. The conservative and Republican Philadelphia [[Public Ledger Syndicate|''Public Ledger'' syndicate]] bought Bryant's thirty-two stories and sold them to Hearst's ''New York American'' and to more than one hundred newspapers over the United States and Canada.{{sfn|Gardner|1982|p=134}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==New York==
Leaving Russia before Reed, who wanted to report on the Bolshevik debate about Russian participation in the war with Germany,{{sfn|Gardner|1982|p=124}} Bryant returned to New York, arriving on February 18, 1918.{{sfn|Gardner|1982|p=126}} She found Greenwich Village much changed by the war: old friends had moved, rents had gone up, and tourists were replacing bohemians.{{sfn|Gardner|1982|pp=126–29}} Under government pressure, ''The Masses'' had shut down.{{sfn|Gardner|1982|p=110}} Working out of a room at the Brevoort Hotel,{{sfn|Gardner|1982|p=126}} Bryant wrote articles about the October Revolution and speeches or cables urging support of the workers' government in Russia.{{sfn|Gardner|1982|pp=130–32}}

Meanwhile, Reed, who was trying to get home, was unable to get State Department clearance for a visa and was detained in [[Oslo]] (then called ''Christiana''), Norway, for more than a month.{{sfn|Dearborn|1996|p=98}} His letters were censored, and Bryant did not hear from him directly until April.{{sfn|Dearborn|1996|p=98}} On orders from [[Sisson Documents|Edgar Sisson]] of the U.S. Commission on Public Information, all of Reed's papers were confiscated when he arrived in New York on April 28.{{sfn|Dearborn|1996|pp=103–04}} Unable to write about the October Revolution without his notes, Reed instead gave speeches advocating U.S. recognition of the new Russian government. That summer, the couple retreated to Croton-on-Hudson.{{sfn|Dearborn|1996|pp=103–04}}

In August, during a long weekend in the arts colony at [[Woodstock, New York|Woodstock]], Bryant began what was to be a long-term, intermittent love affair with painter [[Andrew Dasburg]], with whom she had been close for a couple of years.{{sfn|Dearborn|1996|p=108}} Returning to the Village in September, Bryant and Reed rented a small house at 1 [[Patchin Place]].{{sfn|Dearborn|1996|p=109}} Later in the month, Reed was arrested for giving a speech in which he denounced the [[Allied intervention in the Russian Civil War|use of Allied troops in Russia]]; the specific charge against him was that he had used "disloyal, scurrilous and abusive language about the Military and Naval Forces of the United States". He was released on $5,000 [[bail]].{{sfn|Dearborn|1996|p=110}} In separate cases that year, Reed stood trial with Eastman, [[Floyd Dell]], and others from the former staff of ''The Masses'' for conspiracy to obstruct [[Conscription in the United States|the draft]] of men to fight in World War I and for other alleged offenses related to published articles and cartoons; Reed's alleged crime in the latter case was that he had written a headline, "Knit a Strait-Jacket for Your Soldier Boy", for an article about mental illness among the U.S. troops.{{sfn|Dearborn|1996|pp=96, 110}} Bryant was questioned in ''The Masses'' cases but not charged. Both trials involving ''The Masses'' ended in [[hung jury|hung juries]], and the defendants were set free.{{sfn|Dearborn|1996|p=110}} In October, Bryant's first book, ''Six Red Months in Russia'', was published to "mostly favorable reviews,"{{sfn|Dearborn|1996|p=112}} and Reed resumed work on ''Ten Days That Shook the World'' after the government returned his notes.{{sfn|Gardner|1982|p=146}} It would not be published until April 1919.{{sfn|Dearborn|1996|p=139}}

[[File:Anna Louise Strong 1918.jpg|thumb|upright=0.8|alt=Close-up of a young woman with relatively short hair; she is gazing directly at the camera.|[[Anna Louise Strong]] in 1918, the year before she arranged Bryant's national speaking tour, "The Truth About Russia".]]
In February 1919, while still based in New York, Bryant went to Washington, D.C., to speak, along with [[Albert Rhys Williams]], about the situation in Russia.{{sfn|Gardner|1982|p=148}} She stayed in Washington long enough to participate in a [[National Woman's Party]] suffrage rally, during which she was arrested, [[arraigned]], and sentenced to five days in jail.{{sfn|Dearborn|1996|pp=120–23}} The specific charges against her and others, who had burned President [[Woodrow Wilson]] in [[effigy]] on the [[White House]] lawn, were "building fires on government property, standing on the coping around the White House, or attempting to make disorderly speeches."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Five Days in Jail for 25 Militants|newspaper=The New York Times|date=February 11, 1919|page=5|via=TimesMachine|url=https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1919/02/11/97072350.html|subscription=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; Among a group of women who refused [[bail]], she spent at least three days in jail, during which she took part in a [[hunger strike]].{{sfn|Dearborn|1996|pp=120–23}} Upon her release, she insisted on testifying as an unfriendly witness before the [[Overman Committee]], which had been set up to investigate Bolshevik activity in the United States. Deflecting questions about her religious beliefs, marriages, and other personal matters during her two days of testimony, she tried to convince the subcommittee, led by Senator [[Lee Slater Overman|Lee S. Overman]], that Russia had a right to self-determination.{{sfn|Dearborn|1996|pp=123–26}} Soon thereafter, she began a cross-country speaking tour, "The Truth About Russia", arranged by [[Anna Louise Strong]], during which she addressed large audiences in Detroit, Chicago, Spokane, Seattle, San Francisco, Los Angeles, and other American cities.{{sfn|Gardner|1982|pp=153–63}} According to Gardner, Bryant was the first woman to defend Lenin and Trotsky at political gatherings across the United States. Gardner writes, "Her message was simple, 'Hands off Russia!' 'Bring the boys home!'"{{sfn|Gardner|1982|p=163}}

After Bryant returned from her lecture tour in May, she and Reed spent the next few months mainly in Croton-on-Hudson writing, gardening, and in Reed's case, recuperating from [[influenza]].{{sfn|Dearborn|1996|pp=136–38}} In late August, Reed, who had joined the [[Socialist Party of America]], was chosen by one of its factions, the [[Communist Labor Party of America]] (CLP), to visit Moscow to seek recognition for the CLP as the sole representative of the [[Comintern|Communist International]] (Comintern) in the United States.{{sfn|Dearborn|1996|pp=139–40}} Unlike Reed, Bryant avoided party membership.{{sfn|Dearborn|1996|p=182}} The U.S. government quickly outlawed the CLP and its competitor, the [[American Communist Party]], headed by [[Louis Fraina]].{{sfn|Gelb|1973|p=243}} In danger of being arrested and unable to get a passport to go to Russia, Reed, disguised as a [[Fireman (steam engine)|stoker]], left the United States in late September 1919 on a Scandinavian ship headed for Europe.{{sfn|Gardner|1982|p=174}} During the [[Palmer Raids]] and [[First Red Scare|Red Scare]] days beginning in November 1919, he was charged with conspiring to overthrow the government by force.{{sfn|Gardner|1982|pp=179–80}} In March 1920, after visiting Moscow, he was arrested and incarcerated in Finland on his way home.{{sfn|Gardner|1982|pp=183–89}} Three months later, he was returned to Moscow in a prisoner exchange between the White (anti-Bolshevik) Finns of the [[Finnish Civil War]] and the Bolsheviks.{{sfn|Gardner|1982|pp=183–89}} From [[Tallinn|Reval]] (Tallinn), Estonia, he cabled Bryant, "Passport home refused. Temporarily returning headquarters. Come if possible."{{sfn|Gardner|1982|p=188}} Traveling without passport, Bryant, disguised as the wife of a Swedish businessman,{{sfn|Gardner|1982|p=193}} arrived in Petrograd in late August 1920.{{sfn|Gardner|1982|p=200}}

==Reed's death==
When Bryant reached Petrograd, Reed was in [[Baku]], attending the "first congress of peoples of the east" (Oriental Congress) with the Comintern executive committee.{{sfn|Gardner|1982|pp=200–02, 341}} He had left a letter for her with several possibilities for lodging, one of which was a room he had arranged for her at the Dielovoy Hotel in Moscow. This is where, on September 15, they finally reconnected, spending the next few days together and visiting Lenin, Trotsky, Hungarian revolutionary [[Béla Kun]], and [[Enver Pasha]], a former minister of war in the [[Ottoman Empire]].{{sfn|Gardner|1982|pp=202–05}} Bryant began filing Moscow news stories with the [[International News Service]], which had hired her before she left New York.{{sfn|Gardner|1982|p=205}}

A week after Reed's return from Baku, he began to experience dizziness and headaches, thought at first to be symptoms of influenza. Five days later, when he became delirious, doctors diagnosed [[typhus]] and sent him to the hospital. There, with Bryant by his side, he died on October 17, 1920, a few days shy of his 33rd birthday. On the day of Reed's funeral, in keeping with Russian custom, Bryant walked alone behind the hearse, at the head of the funeral procession. Fainting during the burial, she awoke in her hotel room. Among those at her bedside were Emma Goldman and Alexander Berkman, who had been arrested in the United States and deported to Russia in late 1919.{{sfn|Gardner|1982|pp=200–08}}

==Further reporting==
After Reed's death, Bryant obtained Lenin's approval for a trip to the southern Russian border and neighboring countries.{{sfn|Gardner|1982|p=211}} She went by train over the [[Kazakh Steppe]], through areas hard hit by famine, to [[Tashkent]] and [[Bukhara]] and to the borders of [[Iran]] and [[Afghanistan]], interviewing and taking notes.{{sfn|Gardner|1982|pp=213–17}}

She returned to the U.S. in mid-summer 1921, and stayed for about a year,{{sfn|Dearborn|1996|pp=175–76}} during which she first met [[William Christian Bullitt, Jr.]], then managing editor of film stories at [[Paramount Pictures|Paramount]], to try to persuade him to make ''Ten Days That Shook the World'' into a film.{{sfn|Dearborn|1996|p=201}} Bullitt, a [[Yale University]] graduate from a [[Philadelphia]] family of great wealth, had worked as a journalist specializing in foreign affairs, then as a diplomat in the [[United States Department of State]] before retiring temporarily from politics and taking the Paramount job.{{sfn|Dearborn|1996|pp=191–201}} He later returned to politics and became the first U.S. ambassador to the Soviet Union.&lt;ref name="Bullitt ambassador"/&gt; Bryant and Bullet had in common their interests in Russia, journalism, and Jack Reed, whom Bullitt greatly admired. Although Paramount did not pursue the ''Ten Days'' project, Bullitt was charmed by Bryant and began the amorous pursuit of her that two years later ended in marriage.{{sfn|Dearborn|1996|p=201}}  In August, the ''New York American'', a [[Hearst Corporation|Hearst]] newspaper, began publishing a series of 16 of Bryant's articles describing famine in Russia, Lenin's [[New Economic Policy]], the end of the [[Russian Civil War]], and related topics.{{sfn|Gardner|1982|pp=220–21}} In general, the tone of these articles was "sober and at times unsparing, in contrast to her often rapturous reporting in her 1918 stories."{{sfn|Gardner|1982|p=222}}

In October, she was the main speaker at a memorial for Reed in New York City, and she spent some of her time collecting Reed's papers for possible publication.{{sfn|Dearborn|1996|p=178}} She also arranged with [[King Features Syndicate]], another Hearst agency, to return to Russia to write portraits of Russians. The first of these appeared in print in June 1922 and led to her second book, ''Mirrors of Moscow'', in 1923.{{sfn|Dearborn|1996|pp=181–83}} Bryant's travels in Europe this time included Moscow, Berlin, London, Paris, and other cities. By late October, she was in Rome, accompanied by Bullitt.{{sfn|Dearborn|1996|pp=184–87}} Here in late 1922, she wrote about [[Benito Mussolini]], the Fascist leader who had just come to power and with whom she had obtained an interview. Gathering material from a variety of sources, including Madame [[Rachele Mussolini]], Bryant wrote a feature article, "Mussolini Relies Upon Efficiency to Restore Italy", published in the ''New York American'' in early 1923. She described the future dictator this way:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
I will always think of Mussolini as one of the oddest characters in history, and I will remember him as I last saw him in the great white and gold foyer of the Grand Hotel, under a huge crystal candelabra slouching wearily into a graceful Louis XV ivory and enameled chair.

His pale, heavy-boned face showed signs of sleeplessness. His strong body was bulging over the sides of the seat; his legs were spread wide over the pale, rose-colored velvet carpet. There was a little cup of black coffee, absurdly delicate, beside his gnarled work-warped hand.{{sfn|Dearborn|1996|p=211|ps=. As quoted from the ''New York American'', January 28, 1923, section 52, p. 1.}}
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Leaving Rome to cover the [[Turkish War of Independence]] for the International News Service, Bryant lived with Bullitt in a villa in [[Constantinople]] in early 1923.{{sfn|Gardner|1982|pp=236–37}} While Bullitt worked on a novel, ''It's Not Done'', published in 1926 and dedicated to Bryant, she covered events related to the rise of [[Mustafa Kemal Atatürk]], the first president of the [[Republic of Turkey]].{{sfn|Dearborn|1996|pp=217–19}} From her base in Turkey, she ventured to [[Palermo]] to interview the deposed king of Greece, [[Constantine I of Greece|Constantine I]], and to Athens to interview his son, [[George II of Greece|George II]].{{sfn|Dearborn|1996|p=220}} Shortly thereafter, Bryant suspended her journalistic career to focus on family matters.{{sfn|Dearborn|1996|p=220}}

==Paris==
Later in 1923, Bryant and Bullitt moved to Paris, where they married in December. Two months later,{{sfn|Dearborn|1996|pp=216–24}} Bryant gave birth to her only child, [[Anne Moen Bullitt]] (1924–2007).&lt;ref name="Oregon Encyclopedia"/&gt;{{#tag:ref|Bryant sometimes spelled her father's last name, Mohan, as Moen.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Munk|first=Michael|title=Oregon Voices: The Romance of John Reed and Louise Bryant: New Documents Clarify How They Met|publisher=Oregon Historical Society|volume=109|number=3|date=Fall 2008|p=177|jstor=20615880|via=[[JSTOR]]|subscription=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;|group=n}} In 1925 she and Bullitt added to their family an 8-year-old boy, Refik Ismaili Bey, whom they had met in Turkey.{{sfn|Dearborn|1996|p=225}} As the wife of a rich man, Bryant had duties related to the running of an upper-class household: "...the management of servants, the ordering of food and planning of menus, house decoration, flower arrangement, keeping a social calendar."{{sfn|Dearborn|1996|p=227}} She told one visitor to her home that she considered her new life "useless", and the Bryant–Bullitt marriage began to unravel.{{sfn|Dearborn|1996|pp=227–30}} In "Louise Bryant Grows Old", historian [[Christine Stansell]] examines the great changes in Bryant's life after her marriage to Bullitt:

&lt;blockquote&gt;The entrance of William Bullitt into Louise Bryant's life confounds the intertwined stories of the grief-stricken war widow, the radical heroine, and the champion of the oppressed. The marriage is a puzzle, both biographically and historically. Biographically, it proved to be a disaster, in contrast to Bryant's earlier romantic choices, which had been smart and fulfilling.&lt;ref name="Stansell"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Stansell|first=Christine|title=Louise Bryant Grows Old|journal=History Workshop Journal|jstor=4289696|subscription=yes|publisher=Oxford University Press|volume=50|date=Autumn 2000|page=166|via=[[JSTOR]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

By 1926, Bryant, who had generally abstained from alcohol earlier in life, was suffering from painful and incurable [[adiposis dolorosa]] (Dercum's disease) and was drinking heavily.{{sfn|Dearborn|1996|pp=244–47}} Bullitt, citing his wife's drinking and alleging that she was involved in a lesbian relationship with Gwen Le Gallienne, a stepdaughter of writer [[Richard Le Gallienne]],{{#tag:ref|Gardner says "daughter", but other sources explain that Gwen was Le Gallienne's [[stepdaughter]] via his marriage to Irma Hinton Perry, Gwen's mother.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite newspaper|title=Poet Has Family of Young Artists|newspaper=The Greenwood Commonwealth|agency=Associated Press|url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/12905283/the_greenwood_commonwealth/|via=Newspapers.com|date=August 29, 1927|page=2|access-date=August 6, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;|group=n}} divorced Bryant in 1930 and won sole custody of Anne.{{sfn|Gardner|1982|pp=270–74}} Bryant remained in Paris, occasionally advising writer [[Claude McKay]],{{sfn|Gardner|1982|pp=253–64}} and briefly assisting researchers from Harvard University in preserving Reed's papers.&lt;ref name="Yale papers"/&gt;

==Death and legacy==
Bryant died on January 6, 1936, of a [[brain hemorrhage]] in [[Sèvres]], in the suburbs of Paris,{{sfn|Gardner|1982|p=294}} and is buried in [[Cimetière des Gonards]] in [[Versailles (city)|Versailles]].&lt;ref name="Penny Allen"&gt;{{cite news|last=Allen|first=Penny|title=Rehabilitating a Memory From a Forgotten Grave | newspaper=The New York Times|date=October 15, 1999|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1999/10/15/opinion/15iht-edallen.2.t.html|access-date=January 23, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1998, three volunteers from the [[Oregon Cultural Heritage Commission]] went to Paris to find the grave, which they discovered was crumbling, undated, and scheduled for removal.

Bryant's personal papers were transferred to Bullitt, with whom they remained until their daughter, Anne, donated the collection to Yale University in 2004. They exist as separate collections, the Louise Bryant Papers (MS 1840) and the William C. Bullitt Papers (MS 112) in the [[Sterling Memorial Library]] at Yale. The Louise Bryant Papers consists of about 19 linear feet (5.8 m) of letters, texts, photographs, art, and other materials that she created or collected between 1916 and 1936.&lt;ref name="Yale papers"/&gt;

Bryant's early journalistic work appeared in college publications and in newspapers—''The Spectator'', where Bryant was society editor,{{sfn|Dearborn|1996|pp=22–27}} and ''The Oregonian'', for whom she freelanced—in Portland.&lt;ref name="Oregonian freelance"/&gt; Later work appeared in independent magazines, including ''The Masses'',&lt;ref name="Two Judges"/&gt;  and ''The Liberator'',{{sfn|Dearborn|1996|p=138}} Some, written for the ''[[New York Journal-American|New York American]]'' and other [[William Randolph Hearst|Hearst]] publications, were [[Print syndication|syndicated]] to newspapers across North America.{{sfn|Gardner|1982|p=134}} Collections of her articles appeared in book form in 1918 and 1923. Below is a partial list of her published work.

Mining simulation application can range from pure statistical analysis, to scale models, all the way to replica cabins of mining machinery mounted on [[pneumatic]] actuators surrounded by screens displaying [[3D computer graphics|three-dimensional]] imagery. These simulators rely on [[physics engine]]s and [[geodata]] to accurately simulate the dynamics of the environment.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4050">'''Morphological freedom''' refers to a proposed [[civil right]] of a [[person]] to either maintain or [[body modification|modify their own body]], on their own terms, through [[informed consent|informed, consensual]] recourse to, or refusal of, available therapeutic or enabling [[medical technology]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Bostrom | first1 = N. | title = In Defense of Posthuman Dignity | doi = 10.1111/j.1467-8519.2005.00437.x | journal = Bioethics | volume = 19 | issue = 3 | pages = 202–214 | year = 2005 | pmid =  16167401| pmc = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term may have been coined by [[transhumanist]] [[Max More]] in his 1993 article, ''Technological Self-Transformation: Expanding Personal Extropy'', where he defined it as "the ability to alter bodily form at will through technologies such as surgery, genetic engineering, nanotechnology, uploading". The term was later used by science debater [[Anders Sandberg]] as "an extension of one’s right to one’s body, not just [[self-ownership]] but also the right to modify oneself according to one’s desires."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Bradshaw | first1 = H.

==Politics==
According to [[technocritic]] [[Dale Carrico]], the politics of morphological freedom imply a commitment to the value, standing, and social legibility of the widest possible variety of desired [[morphology (biology)|morphologies]] and [[lifestyle (sociology)|lifestyle]]s. More specifically, morphological freedom is an expression of [[Liberalism in the United States|liberal]] [[Pluralism (political philosophy)|pluralism]], [[secularism]], [[progressivism|progressive]] [[cosmopolitanism]], and [[posthumanist]] [[multiculturalism]]s applied to the ongoing and upcoming transformation of the understanding of [[medicine|medical practice]] from one of conventional therapy to one of [[informed consent|consensual]] [[Self-Determination Theory|self-determination]], via [[human genetic engineering|genetic]], [[cyberware|prosthetic]], and [[neuropharmacology|cognitive]] modification.{{citation needed|date=February 2013}}

==Religion==
According to authors Calvin Mercer and Tracy J. Trothen there is tension between religion and transhumanists, particularly the [[Abrahamic]] traditions, with regards to morphological freedom. While religion generally recognizes the need to heal people and improve their situation from a medical perspective they are generally hesitant to promote a wholesale modification of the body as they see it ultimately belonging to their god.&lt;ref name="MercerTrothen2014"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Calvin Mercer|author2=Tracy J.

'''Namantar Andolan''' (English: '''Name Change Movement''') was a [[Dalit]] movement to change the name of Marathwada University in [[Aurangabad, Maharashtra|Aurangabad]], [[Maharashtra]], India to ''Dr. Babasaheb Ambedkar University''. It achieved a measure of success in 1994 when the compromise name of ''[[Dr. Babasaheb Ambedkar Marathwada University]]'' was accepted. The movement was notable for the violence against Dalits.

==Background==
''Namantar'' means name change&lt;ref name="Jaoul2008" /&gt; and ''andolan'' means [[social movement]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Chauhan |first=B. S. |year=2008 |title=Natural Resources (Forest, water and Minerals) |publisher=Firewall Media Publishers |page=31 |isbn=9788131803288}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Namantar Andolan was a 16-year-long Dalit campaign to rename Marathwada University in recognition of [[B. R. Ambedkar]], the [[jurist]], [[politician]] and [[Social reformers of India|social reformer]] who had proposed that [[untouchability]] should be made illegal.&lt;ref name="RAO" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Human Rights Osaka"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Benjamin|first=Joseph|title=B. R. Ambedkar: An Indefatigable Defender of Human Rights|journal=Focus|date=June 2009|volume=56|url=http://www.hurights.or.jp/archives/focus/section2/2009/06/b-r-ambedkar-an-indefatigable-defender-of-human-rights.html|accessdate=19 August 2013|publisher=Asia-Pacific Human Rights Information Center - Human Rights Osaka}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Human Rights Osaka 2"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Divakar|first=N.

Non-Dalit student groups initially supported the demand to have the university renamed but did so less for reasons of dogma than for the pragmatic desire to bring the Dalit, mostly Mahar, students into the general fold. Dalit students traditionally showed no interest in supporting such causes as lower fees and cheaper textbooks, but they constituted around 26 percent of the student population and anticipated quid pro quo. A march involving Dalit and non-Dalit students was organised with the intent of petitioning the council of the university for the change. The procession met with another, headed by [[Gangadhar Gade]], a [[Dalit Panther]] leader,{{efn|The Dalit Panthers were a group of writers and poets.&lt;ref name=GUHA  /&gt;}} who launched a tirade of abuse at the non-Dalit contingent as he asserted the right of the Dalits to take all the credit for the change in name. This alienated the non-Dalit students and, according to Dipankar Gupta, "the division was caused not so much by caste Hindu prejudices and reticence to support the renaming of the University, but rather by the splittist and sectarian position taken by Gadhe", who might also be concerned that any alliance between Dalits and non-Dalits could affect the potency of the Panthers. Among left-wing organisations, only the [[Students' Federation of India]] and Yukrant continued to support the campaign.&lt;ref name="Gupta" /&gt;

In 1977, the chief minister of Maharashtra, [[Vasantdada Patil]], promised that the renaming would occur, and in July 1978, the [[Maharashtra Legislature (disambiguation)|Maharashtra Legislature]] approved it. Uttara Shastree notes that the campaign at this time reflected the desire of neo-Buddhists for an improved image and position in society, as a significant part of which they called on the symbolic ideas of Ambedkar that had preceded his rise to prominence.&lt;ref name="Shastree1996"&gt;{{cite book |last=Shastree |first=Uttara |year=1996 |title=Religious Converts in India: Socio-political Study of Neo-Buddhists |publisher=Mittal Publications |pages=100–101 |isbn=9788170996293 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=yYInC70BSEgC&amp;pg=PA100}}&lt;/ref&gt; The University Executive Body passed a resolution to rename the university and this series of decisions was the catalyst for rioting, which began on 27 July 1978 and lasted several weeks.&lt;ref name="Holocaust by Damle"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Damle|first=Y. B.|title=Holocaust in Marathwad: 1978|journal=ICSSR Research Abstracts Quarterly|date=January–June 1994|volume=XXIII|url=http://www.unipune.ac.in/snc/cssh/HistorySociology/A%20DOCUMENTS%20ON%20HISTORY%20OF%20SOCIOLOGY%20IN%20INDIA/A%206%20Primary%20sources/C)%20Published%20and%20Unpublished%20Papers%20of%20Y.B.Damle/1)%20Published%20Papers/A%206%20C%201%2018.pdf|accessdate=11 August 2013|publisher=Indian Council of Social Science and Research}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Commentators such as [[Gail Omvedt]] believe that the violence was a caste war based on hatred whilst others, such as Gupta, believe that the causes were more varied. Both Omvedt and Gupta noted that the violence was aimed at the Mahars and did not extend to other Dalit groups, while Gupta also notes that it was concentrated in the three districts of Marathwada&amp;nbsp;— [[Aurangabad district, Maharashtra|Aurangabad]], [[Nanded district|Nanded]] and [[Parbhani district|Parbhani]]&amp;nbsp;— where Dalit registrations in schools and colleges were particularly high, and economic competition was most fierce. In particular, the centres of the unrest were urban areas, where the impact of Mahar aspirations would most deeply affect the employment, social, and economic roles which Hindu castes considered to be their preserve. Troubles were largely absent from the other two districts of [[Beed district|Beed]] and [[Osmanabad district|Osmanabad]], and the spill of problems into rural areas generally was patchy.{{efn|In some rural villages, caste Hindus assisted in defending their Mahar neighbours against trouble-makers; in other instances where trouble arose, it might be on a selective basis, with some particularly aspirational Mahars being targeted but the remainder being tolerated.&lt;ref name="Gupta" /&gt;}} These issues of geographic and [[demographic targeting]], according to Gupta, indicate that the real causes of the violence were more subtle than war between caste Hindu and Dalit. There were also instances of violent acts taking place under the pretext of the riots elsewhere but in fact to settle very local and personal scores unrelated to the broader causes.&lt;ref name="Gupta" /&gt; In contradiction to these views, Y. C. Damle maintains that the violence "specially affected the Scheduled Caste people in the villages although the agitation for renaming the Marathwada University after Dr. Ambedkar was spearheaded by Dalit Panthers and such leaders mainly in urban centres. In giving a call for agitation, hardly any effort was made to protect the villages or villagers."&lt;ref name="Holocaust by Damle" /&gt;

==Attacks==
{{Discrimination sidebar |General}}
Riots affected 1,200 villages in [[Marathwada]], impacting on 25,000 [[Marathi Buddhists]], Dalits and causing thousands of them to seek safety in jungles. The terrorised Dalits did not return to their villages despite of starvation. This violence was allegedly organised by members of the [[Maratha]] community and took many forms, including killings, molestation and rape of Dalit women, burning of houses and huts, pillaging of Dalit colonies, forcing Dalits out of villages, polluting drinking water wells, destruction of cattle and refusal to employ. This continued for 67 days. According to the ''Yukrant'' leader, attacks on Dalit were collective and pre-planned.&lt;ref name="Samiti" /&gt; In many villages, Dalit colonies were burned. The burning houses in Marathwada region affected 900 Dalit households.&lt;ref name="Mendelsohn"&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=FGbp9MjhvKAC&amp;pg=PA73 |title=The Untouchables: Subordination, Poverty and the State in Modern India |first1=Oliver |last1=Mendelsohn |first2=Marika |last2=Vicziany |publisher=Cambridge University Press |pages=73–75, 91 |year=1998 |accessdate=10 May 2013 |isbn=9780521556712}}&lt;/ref&gt; Upper caste rioters demolished essential household items that the Dalit possessed.

==Role of media, political parties and bureaucrats==

===Media===

The regional press played a biased role during the violence.&lt;ref name=Vakil4 /&gt; The Marathi Newspaper, ''Prajawani'' and ''Godatir Samachar'', opposed the Namantar "by giving wide publicity to the riots in the cities and suppressing news in the rural areas." According to ''Aurangabad daily'', ''Marathwada'' the Namantar was a cultural violation for Marathwada existence.&lt;ref name="Samiti"/&gt; The press did not publish about rural violence news.&lt;ref name=Vakil4&gt;{{cite book|last=Vakil|first=A.K.|title=Reservation policy and scheduled castes in India|year=1985|publisher=Asish Pub.

But the media intensified on allegations that the [[Scheduled Caste and Scheduled Tribe (Prevention of Atrocities) Act, 1989|PCR Act]] was being misused.&lt;ref name=RAO /&gt; [[Bhalchandra Nemade]] commented "All Marathi newspapers are communal and they thrive on the so-called '[[freedom of press]]' to serve their own aims."&lt;ref name=Vakil4 /&gt; The chief minister of Maharashtra admitted the one-sided role of the press.&lt;ref name="Samiti" /&gt;

===Political parties===

[[Shiv Sena]], the [[Hindutva]] political party, initially declared itself opposed to the Namantar.&lt;ref name=SONAWANE&gt;{{cite news|last=Sonawane|first=Rakshit|title=Seat gone, Atahwale now plans to revive former militant outfit|url=http://www.indianexpress.com/news/seat-gone-athawale-now-plans-to-revive-former-militant-outfit/375320/|accessdate=22 June 2013|newspaper=Indian Express}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Shiv Sena: A Tiger with Many Faces? |first=Suhas |last=Palshikar |journal=Economic and Political Weekly |volume=39 |issue=14/15 |date=3–16 April 2004 |pages=1497–1507 |jstor=4414867}} {{subscription required}}&lt;/ref&gt; During agitation the supporters of [[Bal Thackeray]] burnt homes of the Dalits.&lt;ref name=PUNWANI&gt;{{cite news|last=Punwani|first=Jyoti|title=Memorial to a dysfunctional state|url=http://www.thehindu.com/opinion/op-ed/memorial-to-a-dysfunctional-state/article4222627.ece|accessdate=22 June 2013|newspaper=The Hindu|date=21 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; People were physically harmed, including by attacks with swords. Interviewers explained that the attackers were from the Maratha community, who also burned Dalit properties in Nanded district. Supporters of the [[Peasants and Workers Party of India]] (PWP) and [[Indian National Congress]] were involved in these burnings. In the same area, there were allegations of two women raped and three children killed, but no legal action instigated. &lt;ref name="Vakil"&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.co.in/books?id=6DCegd2xxF8C&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |title=Reservation Policy and Scheduled Castes in India |first=A.

{{quote|"PWP and Shiv Sena aggravated the tension in Parbhani, Nanded, Beed, and Osmanbad. Congress did not show any inclination to defuse the tension and whatever efforts were made particularly by the Congress leaders from Beed and Osmanabad districts were insufficient or localised. On the other hand, Congress leaders particularly from Latur, Aurangabad, Jalna and to some extent Beed districts identified with the Dalit cause and worked for the Dalit harmony in these districts to maintain political impression."&lt;ref name="Guru"/&gt;|sign=|source=}}

But later in 2011, [[Bal Thackeray]] cleared that he never opposed the Namantar. He said in an interview that:

{{quote|"Let me make it clear once again. I never opposed the renaming of the university. I had suggested that the name Marathwada University be retained, and Ambedkar's name is added to it. RPI leader R. S. Gavai came to my residence and I suggested that Ambedkar's name is added to the existing name of the university. He liked the idea and phoned Sharad Pawar (the then chief minister) who also gave his approval.

===Bureaucrats===

Many Dalits were harassed by the police as they continued to campaign for the change. The police allegedly reacted by adopting tactics such as delay and suppression of evidence.&lt;ref name="Samiti" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Abraham"&gt;{{cite journal |title=Importance of Renaming Marathwada University |first=Amrita |last=Abraham |journal=Economic and Political Weekly |volume=14 |issue=29 |date=21 July 1979 |pages=1190–1191 |jstor=4367800}} {{subscription required}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a few villages, Hindu police patils and [[Sarpanch|sarpanchs]] of all riot-affected villages teamed up with rich Hindu caste landowners to attack Dalit's poor peasants and agricultural labourers.&lt;ref name="Samiti"/&gt; Police joined the mob in a violent way.&lt;ref name=Vakil50&gt;{{cite book|last=Vakil|first=A.K.|title=Reservation policy and scheduled castes in India|year=1985|publisher=Asish Pub.

==Effects==
After the riots, many landlords refused to employ Dalits and even at public places such as hotels, discriminated against them.&lt;ref name="Samiti"/&gt; Rioters created a silent boycott.

Sooner after the atrocities, authorities brought around 3000 individuals into the police custody, but victims reported that very few went into the court, and the remaining cases weren't much faster. Even natives pressured to dismiss all cases. The parliamentary committee advised "an automatic judicial inquiry in all cases of large-scale arson and looting involved Dalits." But, the judicial inquiry was opposed by the Maharashtra government.&lt;ref name="Abraham" /&gt;

==Long March==
[[File:Diksha Bhumi.jpg|thumb|right|200px|[[Deekshabhoomi]], where Ambedkar embraced Buddhism, from where  [[Jogendra Kawade]] launched and led the Long March on 11 November 1979&lt;ref name=KAWADE /&gt;]]

On 4 August 1978, [[Jogendra Kawade]] led a march from Deekshabhoomi to [[District collector|District magistrate]] office in Nagpur to rename the university. On the same day, there was a meeting in Aakashwani Chowk attended by a large student crowd. Following, the people were going back home zestfully. The provoked violence started when some anti-social elements pelted stones at transportation links. The police opened fire to overcome turbulence. After this incident, the Long march was declared. Dalit protestors from [[Delhi]], [[Haryana]], [[Bihar]], [[Madhya Pradesh]], [[Andhra Pradesh]], Karnataka and [[Tamil Nadu]] reached to Nagpur.&lt;ref name="नागपुर से उठी चिंगारी"&gt;{{cite news|title=नागपुर से उठी चिंगारी, औरंगाबाद में बनी ज्वाला|url=http://www.bhaskar.com/article/MH-third-largest-long-march-2500072.html|accessdate=16 August 2013|newspaper=[[Dainik Bhaskar]]|date=14 October 2011|agency=DB Corp Ltd.|language=Hindi|quote=4 अगस्त 1978 को आंदोलन का आगाज हुआ। प्रा. कवाड़े के नेतृत्व में दीक्षाभूमि से जिलाधिकारी कार्यालय तक मोर्चा निकाला गया। आकाशवाणी चौक में बड़ी सभा हुई। उसमें बड़ी संख्या में छात्र शामिल हुए। सभा के बाद लोग उत्साहपूर्ण अपने घरों की ओर लौट रहे थे, तभी उत्तर नागपुर के 10 नंबर पुलिया चौक पर अचानक हिंसा भड़क उठी। कुछ असामाजिक तत्वों ने सरकारी बसों पर पत्थर फेंके। हिंसा पर काबू पाने के लिए पुलिस ने फायरिंग शुरू कर दी।….. तब नागपुर से औरंगाबाद लांग मार्च ले जाने की घोषणा की गई। दिल्ली, हरियाणा, बिहार, मध्यप्रदेश, आंध्रप्रदेश, कर्नाटक व तमिलनाडु से दलित आंदोलनों से जुड़े लोग यहां आने लगे।….. उसी वर्ष दीक्षाभूमि पर धम्मचक्र प्रवर्तन दिन समारोह से लांग मार्च की शुरुआत हुई। बौद्ध पंडित भदंत आनंद कौशल्यायन ने आशीर्वाद दिया।…..30 किमी प्रतिदिन पैदल चलते हुए इस मार्च ने 18 दिनों में 470 किमी का सफर तय किया।..... कड़ाके की ठंड पड़ रही थी।….. मराठवाड़ा विद्यापीठ के नामांतर के लिए किया गया लांग मार्च दुनिया का तीसरा सबसे बड़ा मार्च था।….. लांग मार्च में गांव के गांव शामिल होने से संख्या बल काफी बढ़ने लगा था।..... 27 नवंबर कि बात है। आंदोलनकारी खड़कपूर्णा नदी तक पहुंच गए। दोपहर में ही आंदोलनकारियों को रोक लिया गया था। उन्हें वापस जाने के लिए कहा जा रहा था, लेकिन वे अपनी मांग पर अड़े थे। संयोग से उस दिन बारिश भी हो रही थी। हजारों की संख्या में लोग जमा हुए थे। पुल पर ही धरना पर बैठ गए। रात 12 बजे के बाद लाठीचार्ज शुरू हुआ। पुल के खाईनुमा छोरों को लांघकर आंदोलनकारी झुड़पी क्षेत्र में भागे। कइयों ने गहरी नींद में लाठी खायी।…... कवाडे समेत सैकाडो आंदोलनकारीयोको गिरफ्तार कर लिया गया।..... आंदोलन धीरे-धीरे अन्य प्रदेशों में भी नजर आने लगा। आगरा, दिल्ली, बेंगलुरु, हैदराबाद में मोर्चे निकाले गए। 16 वर्ष ताकत आंदोलन के समर्थन में सभाओं, मोर्चो का दौर चला। बार-बार गिरफ्तारियां हुईं। '''English translation:'''  The movement was born August 4, 1978. Prof. Kawade led the March from Deekshabhoomi to the District Magistrate's office. There was a large gathering at the ''Akashaawani Chowk.'' That was attended by the large number of students. After gathering people were returning to their homes with enthusiasm, concurrently, when suddenly violence broke out from Number 10 Bridge. Some anti-social elements threw stones at government buses. To counter the violence, the police started firing.....Then, the Nagpur to Aurangabad Long March was announced. People involved in the Dalit movement from Delhi, Haryana, Bihar, Madhya Pradesh, Andhra Pradesh, Karnataka and Tamil Nadu started coming here..... On Deekshabhoomi (the same year) with celebrations of '''Dhammachakra Parivartan Din''' the Long March began. Blessed by the Buddhist monk Bhadant Anand Kaushlyayn..... Covering 30 km every day on foot, this March in 18 days completed the journey of 470 km..... It was bitterly cold..... The March for the renaming of Marathwada University was the world's third largest Long March..... Numerous villages joined the Long March, and the strength of the cause began to grow significantly..... On 27 November, Protestors reached the ''Khadakpurna'' River. Protestors were detained in the afternoon. They were being asked to turn back, but they were adamant in their demands. Incidentally it was raining on that day. Thousands of people joined. On the bridge, sat on the picket. Lathicharge began after 12 am. Protestors ran into the bushes there. Many were lathi-charged while they slept..... Thousands of Protestors were arrested along with Prof Kawade..... The movement gradually spread to other states. There was the March in Agra, Delhi, Benaglore, Hydrabad. In support of the movement for 16 years there were gatherings, and the Marches continued.

The violence caused the Dalits to suspend their campaign for a while, but when a new incumbent as Chief Minister, [[Sharad Pawar]], found various reasons to postpone the renaming, the reaction was the organisation of a Long March and instigating the Namantar Andolan.&lt;ref name="Shastree1996"/&gt; The march was inspired by the [[Long March|Chinese Long March]] and intended to end symbolically with convergence in Aurangabad on 6 December 1979, on Ambedkar's death anniversary.&lt;ref name="Jaoul2008" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Shastree1996"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Omvedt1993" /&gt; According to Omvedt,&lt;ref name="Omvedt1993"&gt;{{cite book |last=Omvedt |first=Gail |authorlink=Gail Omvedt |year=1993 |title=Reinventing revolution: new social movements and the socialist tradition in India |publisher=M.E.

"This march was the world's third largest Long March."&lt;ref name="नागपुर से उठी चिंगारी" /&gt; According to ''Yukrant'' leader, around 3 ''[[Lakh|Lakhs]]'' of people were expected to join the Long March to rename the university after Ambedkar's name. A small percentage reached to Aurangabd, but minimum 3 lakhs organized the mass protest – ''[[satyagraha]]'', ''Jail Bharo Andolan'', March.  The protesters clashed with the police between 25 November to 6 December. Thousands of Long March activists walking from Nagpur, [[Udgir]] and [[Satara (city)|Satara]] were taken into custody at the boundaries of Marathwada. Thousands were arrested during ''staygraha'' struggle at their towns and cities. Protestors were ''lathi'' charged, police fired shots on them on 6 December, Ambedkar's death anniversary. On the same day, [[Vidarbha]] [[bandh]] was observed.&lt;ref name="Omvedt 1979" /&gt; On 27 November, police stopped the protestors at Khadakpurna River Bridge in the afternoon. Thousands of protestors started a [[sit-in]] at the Khadakpurna River Bridge. They were ''lathi'' charged after 12 AM in their sleep, during the course many ran away and hundreds were arrested.&lt;ref name="नागपुर से उठी चिंगारी" /&gt;

Demonstrators of Dalit Panthers were arrested at [[Bhadkal Gate]] and at the university entrance. Leaders and activists arrested, physically harmed, [[lathi charge]]d, shot with [[tear gas]] and air firing to disperse the crowd. The intention of the state was to control and disperse demonstrators and keep them from anti Dalits,&lt;ref name="Omvedt 1979" /&gt; who formed ''Namantar Virodhi Group'' (a group opposing renaming).&lt;ref name="Shastree1996" /&gt; Most of them were freed from jails on the same evening but few refused to leave Jails to continue ''satyagraha''. The main agenda of this Long March was to battle against caste oppression.&lt;ref name="Omvedt 1979"/&gt;

The movement became a part of [[Dalit literature]].&lt;ref name="google1"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Images of women in Maharashtrian literature and religion |editor-first=Anne |editor-last=Feldhaus |publisher=SUNY Press |year=1996 |isbn=9781438402499 |pages=80–83 |chapter=Stri Dalit Sahitya: The New Voice of Women Poets |first=Eleanor |last=Zelliot}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Omvedt "the upsurge, turmoil's and frustration of the long march campaign brought the movement to a new turning point. The readiness for action shown by Dalit masses provided a demonstration of their powerful urge for revolutionary change".&lt;ref name="Omvedt 1979" /&gt; During the Long March, men sung songs of [[martyr]]s, women even joined children to boost this revolution.&lt;ref name="Omvedt1993" /&gt; The andolan gradually turned out in [[Agra]], Delhi, [[Banglore]], [[Hydrabad|Hyderabad]] where people protested marching.

==Namvistar Din==
[[Govindbhai Shroff]] was against renaming the university but he requested people to accept the new name with non-violence. Concurrently, he pressed a requirement to withdraw the Scheduled Caste and Scheduled Tribe (Prevention of Atrocities) Act cases against non-Dalits, specifically the ''malafide'' ones. Tight security was deployed on the eve of the announcement with a few incidents reported in [[Parbhani]] and [[Amravati]].&lt;ref name="Damle"&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.co.in/books?id=-nVDBvv_OqAC&amp;pg=PA140 |title=Beyond Economic Development: A Case Study of Marathwada |first=Jasmine Y. |last=Damle |publisher=Mittal |year=2001 |pages=140–146 |accessdate=10 May 2013 |isbn=9788170997962}}&lt;/ref&gt; The police imposed a curfew at Tuljapur and shots fired by the police were reported in Beed.&lt;ref name="Damle" /&gt; After renaming the university, at least four Dalits were stabbed, Dalit property was set on fire and statues of Ambedkar dishonoured at Parbhani and Osmanabad.&lt;ref name=RAO /&gt; However, in Osmanabad district, at Kathi Savargaon, the renaming decision was welcomed with celebration by Maratha sarpanch in village. A similar case was reported in Lohara.&lt;ref name="Guru" /&gt;

Marathwda region has a diverse cultural and historical background, so many names were suggested.

The chosen form&amp;nbsp;— Dr. Babasaheb Ambedkar Marathwada University&amp;nbsp;— represents an expansion of the existing name (a ''Namvistar'') rather than complete change (''Namanatar''). Sharad Pawar also announced that it would be a policy to encourage higher education for everyone, irrespective of caste, class, religion, and ethnicity. Moreover, the newly named university was developed with improved facilities in some departments to conceptualize the dream of Ambedkar which was one of the important parameters for the University.&lt;ref name="Damle" /&gt; At the same time, the university adopted the Ajanta arch with elephants as its primary logo, reflecting the Buddhist cultural significance of the [[Ajanta caves]].&lt;ref name="BAMU" /&gt;

Every 14 January, the followers of Ambedkar throng the university. The political parties and organizations based on Ambedkar's thinking celebrate this day. Many people visit the university to celebrate the ''Namvistar Din'', so political parties arrange their rallies traditionally. The University building and gate is decorated with lights.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7718">'''Oblique effect''' is the name given to the relative deficiency in perceptual performance for oblique contours as compared to the performance for horizontal or vertical contours.

==Background==
The earliest known observation of this effect came about in 1861 when [[Ernst Mach]]&lt;ref&gt;Mach, E. 1861 Ueber das Sehen von Lagen und Winkeln durch die Bewegung des Auges. ''Sitzungsberichte der Mathematisch-Naturwissenschaftlichen Classe der Kaiserlichen Akademie der Wissenschaften, Wien'' 43(2), 215-224&lt;/ref&gt; completed an experiment in which he set a line to make it appear parallel to an adjoining one, and found observers' errors to be least for horizontal and vertical orientations and largest for an inclination of 45 degrees.  The effect can be demonstrated for many visual tasks and was named ''oblique effect'' in the widely cited article by Stuart [[Appelle]].&lt;ref&gt;Appelle S. 1972 Perception and discrimination as function of stimulus orientation. ''Psychological Bulletin'' 78,266-278&lt;/ref&gt;

==The Phenomenon==

[[Image:Machsquare.png|thumb|left|100px|''Appearance'' of figure changes on 45 deg rotation]]
[[Image:ObliqueEffect.png|thumb|right|150px|Discrimination of length (top) and orientation (bottom) for a line at various orientations around the clock]] The effect is exhibited predominantly in tasks involving discrimination of the angle of tilt of patterns or contours.  People are very good at detecting whether a picture is hung vertical, but are two- to fourfold worse for a 45-degree oblique contour, even when a comparison is available. However there is no oblique deficit in some other tasks, such as judgment of lengths.  Similarly, while it is harder to judge the direction of motion when it is oblique, this is not the case for speed.

The figure on the right shows the performance when an observer makes judgments about the length (top) and the orientation (bottom)of a line, in eight orientations around the clock.

Even the immediate appearance of the form of a figure, often called [[Gestalt psychology|gestalt]], changes on a 45-degree rotation—the geometrical congruity of the square and the diamond does not extend to their perception as figures (see left) as was emphasized by [[Ernst Mach]].

==Origin of the Oblique Effect==

As with [[geometrical-optical illusions]] the oblique effect can be examined at two levels. The ''physiological'' one looks at the neural apparatus. Much pertinent information has been gathered here, yet the phenomenon was discovered in, and has ultimate relevance to, the whole organism's performance.  Hence it is not contradictory to follow two separate tracks of explanation.

=== Physiological ===

Neural processing of contours was highlighted by the classical research by Hubel and Wiesel &lt;ref&gt;Hubel, D.H., &amp; Wiesel, T.N. (1959). Receptive fields of single neurones in the cat's striate cortex. J. Physiol., 148, 574-591.&lt;/ref&gt; which revealed neural units right at the entrance of visual signals into the brain that respond preferentially to lines and edges. When the distribution of preferred orientation of these units was examined, there were fewer in the oblique meridians than in the vertical and horizontal.&lt;ref&gt;Li B, Peterson MR, Freeman RD, (2003) Oblique effect: a neural basis in the visual cortex ''Journal of Neurophysiology'' 90, 204-217&lt;/ref&gt;

Orientation differences also occur in testing the visual brain with probes for cell connectivity &lt;ref&gt;Li, W., &amp; Gilbert, C.D. (2002). Global Contour Saliency and Local Colinear Interactions . J Neurophysiol, 88 (5), 2846-2856. {{doi|10.1152/jn.00289}}&lt;/ref&gt; and with imaging techniques.&lt;ref&gt;Furmanski CS, Engel SA (2000) An oblique effect in human primary visual cortex ''Nature Neuroscience'' 3,535-536&lt;/ref&gt;

However, in contrast to the strong behavioral effect, evidence for orientation selectivity bias in primary visual cortex is weak and controversial. Actually, many human fMRI studies have failed to see this biased activity in primary visual cortex.&lt;ref&gt;Freeman J, Brouwer GJ, Heeger DJ, Merriam EP (2011) Orientation decoding depends on maps, not columns. Journal of Neuroscience 31(13):4792-4804&lt;/ref&gt;  Rather, more recent studies have suggested that, oblique effect may be due to selectivity for cardinal (i.e. horizontal and vertical) orientations in higher level visual areas and more specifically in parahippocampal place area (PPA),&lt;ref&gt;Nasr S, Tootell RBH (2012) A cardinal orientation bias in scene-selective visual cortex. Journal of Neuroscience 32(43):14921-6&lt;/ref&gt; an area devoted to scene perception.&lt;ref&gt;Epstein RA, Kanwisher N (1998) A cortical representation of the local visual environment. Nature 392:598–601&lt;/ref&gt; This finding is supported by the fact that, among all visual object categories, perception of scenes (both natural and man-made environments) receives more processing benefit from the oblique effect and higher visual acuity for horizontal and vertical contours, due to their unique structure.&lt;ref&gt;Torralba A, Oliva A (2003) Statistics of natural image categories. Network 14:391-412&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Empirical ===
Nevertheless, there is an oblique effect for target configurations that do not directly address these "oriented" neural elements early in the visual path into the brain.&lt;ref&gt;Westheimer, G. (2003). Meridional anisotropy in visual processing: implications for the neural site of the oblique effect. Vision Research, 43 (22), 2281-2289.&lt;/ref&gt; Regardless of where in the brain of the human or animals an oblique effect is found, one would still like to know whether it is an inevitable consequence of the way neural signals are processed, or whether it is a minor error that nature hadn't been bothered to correct, or whether it fulfills a function in making us better in handling our visual environment. Proposing a "purpose" of the oblique effect, and developing scientific support for it is still a work in progress. A popular concept is that we live in a  [[carpenteredness|carpentered]] environment. Attempts at empirical explanations of perceptual visual phenomena have led to the examination of the orientation distribution of contours in the everyday visual world.&lt;ref&gt;Howe CQ, Purves D. (2005) Perceiving geometry : geometrical illusions explained by natural scene statistics  Springer : New York&lt;/ref&gt;

Competing explanations have to contend with questions, not yet finalized, of innateness of horizontal/vertical superiority, of body symmetry in anatomical organization, of methodology  of measurement, and particularly, of issues associated with perceptual development in infants and children, and across cultures.

==Notes==
'''Meridian:''' In vision, a plane containing the anterior-posterior axis of the eye. According to standards in the eye professions, the left side of the horizontal meridian, as seen by the subject, has '''0-deg orientation''', and orientations increase in a clockwise direction, again as seen by subject.

'''Cardinal''' directions are horizontal and vertical.

The horizontal effect is an extension of the oblique effect in which... ''When presented [with] a natural or other broad-band scene, people see oblique content the best and they actually see horizontal content the worst, with vertical usually falling in between''.&lt;ref&gt;http://louisville.edu/psychology/essock/lab/projects/perception-of-oriented-stimuli&lt;/ref&gt;

'''[[Vertical-horizontal illusion]],''' the overestimation of vertical distances in vision, is not generally encompassed by the oblique effect, which mostly lumps the vertical and horizontal together in making comparisons with the obliques.

'''Penal transportation''' or '''transportation''' was the relocation of [[convict]]ed criminals, or other persons regarded as undesirable, to a distant place, often a [[colony]] for a specified term; later, specifically established [[penal colony|penal colonies]] became their destination.  While the prisoners may have been released once the sentence was served, they generally did not have the resources to get themselves back home.

England transported its convicts and political prisoners, as well as prisoners of war from [[Scotland]] and [[Ireland]], to [[British America|its overseas colonies in the Americas]] from the 1610s until early in the [[American Revolution]] in 1776, when transportation to America was temporarily suspended by the Criminal Law Act 1776 (16 Geo. 3 c.43).&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=B09RAQAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA262&amp;#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false "An act to authorise, for a limited time, the punishment by hard labour of offenders who, for certain crimes, are or shall become liable to be transported to any of his Majesty's colonies and plantations."]&lt;/ref&gt; The practice was mandated in Scotland by an act of 1785, but was less used there than in England. Transportation on a large scale resumed with the departure of the [[First Fleet]] to [[Australia]] in 1787, and continued there [[History of Australia#Colonisation|until 1868]].

France transported convicts to [[Devil's Island]] and [[New Caledonia]] from 1852 and the 1860s until 1953 and 1897, respectively.

== Origin and implementation ==
[[Banishment]] or forced [[exile]] from a polity or society has been used as a punishment since at least [[Ancient Rome|Ancient Roman]] times. It removed the offender from society, possibly permanently, but was seen as more merciful than [[capital punishment]]. From the earliest days of English colonial schemes, new settlements beyond the seas were seen as a way to alleviate domestic social problems of criminals and the poor,&lt;ref&gt;See:[[English Poor Laws#A new colonial solution]]&lt;/ref&gt; as well as to increase the colonial labour force, production, and overall benefit of the realm.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.british-history.ac.uk/no-series/acts-ordinances-interregnum/pp403-406 August 1650: An Act for the Advancing and Regulating of the Trade of this Commonwealth], Acts and Ordinances of the Interregnum, 1642-1660. Originally published by His Majesty's Stationery Office, London, 1911. "The Parliament of England taking into their care the maintenance and advance of the Traffick Trade, and several Manufactures of this Nation; and being desirous to improve and multiply the same for the best advantage and benefit thereof, to the end that ye poore people of this Land may be set on work, and their Families preserved from Beggary and Ruine, and that the Commonwealth might be enriched thereby, and no occasion left either for Idleness or Poverty:..."&lt;/ref&gt;

Initially based on the [[royal prerogative of mercy]],&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.org/stream/cu31924026356299/cu31924026356299_djvu.txt Acts of the Privy Council of England] Colonial Series, Vol. I, 1613-1680, p.12. (1908)&lt;/ref&gt; and later under [[English Law]], transportation was an alternative sentence imposed for a [[felony]]; it was typically imposed for offences for which [[capital punishment|death]] was deemed too severe. By 1670, as new felonies were defined, the option of being sentenced to transportation was allowed.&lt;ref&gt;Egerton, Hugh Edward,[https://archive.org/stream/ashorthistorybr01egergoog#page/n60/mode/2up A short history of British colonial policy], p.40 (1897)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.british-history.ac.uk/statutes-realm/vol5/p709 Charles II, 1670 &amp; 1671: An Act to prevent the malitious burning of Houses, Stackes of Corne and Hay and killing or maiming of Catle.]&lt;/ref&gt; Forgery of a document, for example, was a capital crime until the 1820s, when the penalty was reduced to transportation. Depending on the crime, the sentence was imposed for life or for a set period of years. If imposed for a period of years, the offender was permitted to return home after serving out his time, but had to make his own way back. Many offenders thus stayed in the colony as free persons, and might obtain employment as jailers or other servants of the penal colony.

Transportation was not used by Scotland before the [[Act of Union 1707]]; following union, the [[Transportation Act 1717]] specifically excluded its use in Scotland.&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.org/stream/statutesatlarge54britgoog#page/n504/mode/2up Transportation Act 1717], Section 8, p.475&lt;/ref&gt; Under the Transportation, etc. Act 1785 (25 Geo. 3 c. 46) the [[Parliament of Great Britain]] specifically extended the usage of transportation to Scotland.&lt;ref name="archive.org"&gt;[https://archive.org/stream/statutesatlarge23unkngoog#page/n206/mode/2up "An act for the effectual transportation of felons, and other offenders, in that part of Great Britain called Scotland, and to authorize the removal of prisoners in certain places."]&lt;/ref&gt; It remained little used&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |title=Scottish Criminals and Transportation to Australia 1786–1852 |first=Ian |last=Donnachie |journal=journal Scottish Economic and Social History |year=1984}}&lt;/ref&gt; under Scots Law until the early 19th century.

In Australia, a convict who had served part of his time might apply for a [[Ticket of leave#Australian convicts|ticket of leave]], permitting some prescribed [[Freedom (political)|freedoms]]. This enabled some convicts to resume a more normal life, to marry and raise a family, and to contribute to the development of the colony.

==Historical background==

===The trend towards more flexibility of sentencing===
[[File:Convict ship Neptune00.jpg|thumb|[[Neptune (1780 ship)|The Neptune]], a 19th-century [[convict ship]] that brought prisoners to Australia]]
In England in the 17th and 18th centuries criminal justice was severe, later termed the [[Bloody Code]]. This was due to both the particularly large number of offences which were punishable by execution, (usually by hanging), and to the limited choice of sentences available to judges for convicted criminals.  With modifications to the traditional [[Benefit of clergy]], which originally exempted only clergymen from civil law, it developed into a [[legal fiction]] by which many common offenders of "clergyable" offenses were extended the privilege to avoid execution.&lt;ref&gt;Beattie, 1986, p. 470&lt;/ref&gt; Many offenders were pardoned as it was considered unreasonable to execute them for relatively minor offences, but under the [[rule of law]], it was equally unreasonable for them to escape punishment entirely. With the development of colonies, transportation was introduced as an alternative punishment, although legally it was considered a condition of a pardon, rather than a sentence in itself.&lt;ref&gt;Beattie, 1986, p. 472&lt;/ref&gt; Convicts who represented a menace to the community were sent away to distant lands. A secondary aim was to discourage crime for fear of being transported. Transportation continued to be described as a public exhibition of the king's mercy. It was a solution to a real problem in the domestic penal system.&lt;ref&gt;Beattie, 1986, p. 473&lt;/ref&gt; There was also the hope that transported convicts could be rehabilitated and reformed by starting a new life in the colonies. In 1615, in the reign of [[James VI and I|James I]], a committee of the Council had already obtained the power to choose from the prisoners those that deserved pardon and, consequently, transportation to the colonies. Convicts were chosen carefully: the Acts of the Privy Council showed that prisoners "for strength of bodie or other abilities shall be thought fit to be employed in foreign discoveries or other services beyond the Seas".&lt;ref&gt;Acts of the Privy Council (Colonial), vol. I , pp. 310, 314-15&lt;/ref&gt;

During the [[Commonwealth of England|Commonwealth]], Cromwell overcame the popular prejudice against subjecting Christians to slavery or selling them into foreign parts, and initiated group transportation of military&lt;ref&gt;Cunningham. Growth of Eng. Industry and Com. in Mod. Times; 109, Cambridge, 1892. Cited in Karl Frederick Geiser, [https://archive.org/stream/redemptionersind00geis/redemptionersind00geis_djvu.txt Redemptioners and indentured servants in the colony and commonwealth of Pennsylvania], Supplement to the [[Yale Review]], Vol. X, No. 2, August, 1901. "There was a popular prejudice against subjecting Christians into slavery or selling them into foreign parts, but Cromwell did not draw any such distinctions. Not only did his agents systematically capture Irish youths and girls for export to the West Indies, but all the garrison who were not killed in the Drogheda Massacre were shipped as slaves to the Barbadoes."&lt;/ref&gt; and civilian prisoners.&lt;ref&gt;30 July 1649 Act empowering the Lord Mayor, Justices of Gaol delivery for Newgate, to transport threescore prisoners convicted of Felony and other heinous crimes, unto the Summer Islands or other new English Plantations.&lt;/ref&gt; With the [[Restoration (England)|Restoration]], the penal transportation system and the number of people subjected to it, started to change inexorably between 1660 and 1720, with transportation replacing the simple discharge of clergyable felons after [[Human branding#Branding in Britain|branding the thumb]]. Alternatively, under the second act dealing with [[Moss-trooper]] brigands on the Scottish border, offenders had their benefit of clergy taken away, or otherwise at the judge's discretion, were to be transported to America, "there to remaine and not to returne".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.british-history.ac.uk/statutes-realm/vol5/p598 Statutes of the Realm: Volume 5, 1628-80], p.598&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.org/stream/statutesatlarge20unkngoog#page/n587/mode/2up Statutes at Large, Volume 24, Index for acts passed before 1 Geo. 3] p.581&lt;/ref&gt; There were various influential agents of change: judges' discretionary powers influenced the law significantly, but the king's and Privy Council's opinions were decisive in granting a royal pardon from execution.&lt;ref&gt;Beattie, 1986, p. 471&lt;/ref&gt;

The system changed one step at a time: in February 1663, after that first experiment, a bill was proposed to the [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom|House of Commons]] to allow the transporting of felons, and was followed by another bill presented to the Lords to allow the transportation of criminals convicted of felony within clergy or petty larceny. These bills failed, but it was clear that change was needed.&lt;ref&gt;Beattie, 1986, pp. 471–472&lt;/ref&gt; Transportation was not a sentence in itself, but could be arranged by indirect means. The reading test, crucial for the [[benefit of clergy]], was a fundamental feature of the penal system, but in order to prevent its abuse, this pardoning process was used more strictly. Prisoners were carefully selected for transportation based on information about their character and previous criminal record. It was arranged that they fail the reading test, but they were then reprieved and held in jail, without bail, to allow time for a royal pardon (subject to transportation) to be organised.&lt;ref&gt;Beattie, 1986, p. 475&lt;/ref&gt;

===Transportation as a commercial transaction===
Transportation became a business: merchants chose from among the prisoners on the basis of the demand for labour and their likely profits. They obtained a contract from the sheriffs, and after the voyage to the colonies they sold the convicts as [[indentured servant]]s. The payment they received also covered the jail fees, the fees for granting the pardon, the clerk's fees, and everything necessary to authorise the transportation.&lt;ref name="Beattie, 1986, p. 479"&gt;Beattie, 1986, p. 479&lt;/ref&gt; These arrangements for transportation continued until the end of the 17th century and beyond, but they diminished in 1670 due to certain complications. The colonial opposition was one of the main obstacles: colonies were unwilling to collaborate in accepting prisoners: the convicts represented a danger to the colony and were unwelcome. [[Maryland]] and [[Virginia]] enacted laws to prohibit transportation in 1670, and the king was persuaded to respect these.&lt;ref name="Beattie, 1986, p. 479"/&gt;

The penal system was also influenced by economics: the profits obtained from convicts' labour boosted the economy of the colonies and, consequently, of England. Nevertheless, it could be argued that transportation was economically deleterious because the aim was to enlarge population, not diminish it;&lt;ref&gt;Beattie, 1986, p. 480&lt;/ref&gt; but the character of an individual convict was likely to harm the economy. [[King William's War]] (1688–1697) (part of the [[Nine Years' War]]) and the [[War of the Spanish Succession]] (1701–14) adversely affected merchant shipping and hence transportation. In the post-war period there was more crime&lt;ref&gt;Beattie, 1986, p. 500&lt;/ref&gt; and hence potentially more executions, and something needed to be done. In the reigns of [[Anne, Queen of Great Britain|Queen Anne]] (1702–14) and [[George I of Great Britain|George I]] (1714–27), transportation was not easily arranged, but imprisonment was not considered enough to punish hardened criminals or those who had committed capital offences, so transportation was the preferred punishment.&lt;ref name="Beattie, 1986, p. 502"&gt;Beattie, 1986, p. 502&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Transportation Act 1717 ===
There were several obstacles to the use of transportation. In 1706 the reading test for claiming benefit of clergy was abolished (5 Anne c. 6). This allowed judges to sentence "clergyable" offenders to a [[workhouse]] or a [[house of correction]].&lt;ref name="Beattie, 1986, p. 502"/&gt; But the punishments that then applied were not enough of a disincentive to commit crime: another solution was needed. The [[Transportation Act 1717|Transportation Act]] was introduced into the House of Commons in 1717 under the [[Whigs (British political party)|Whig]] government. It legitimised transportation as a direct sentence, thus simplifying the penal process.&lt;ref name="Beattie, 1986, p. 503"&gt;Beattie, 1986, p. 503&lt;/ref&gt;

Non-capital convicts (clergyable [[felon]]s usually destined for branding on the thumb, and [[petty larceny]] convicts usually destined for public whipping)&lt;ref&gt;Beattie, 2001, p. 428&lt;/ref&gt; were directly sentenced to transportation to the American colonies for seven years. A sentence of fourteen years was imposed on prisoners guilty of capital offences pardoned by the king. Returning from the colonies before the stated period was a capital offence.&lt;ref name="Beattie, 1986, p. 503"/&gt; The bill was introduced by [[William Thompson (Ipswich MP)|William Thomson]], the [[Solicitor General]], who was "the architect of the transportation policy".&lt;ref&gt;Beattie, 2001, p. 429&lt;/ref&gt; Thomson, a supporter of the Whigs, was [[Recorder (judge)|Recorder]] of London and became a judge in 1729. He was a prominent sentencing officer at the Old Bailey and the man who gave important information about capital offenders to the cabinet.&lt;ref&gt;Beattie, 2001, p. 426&lt;/ref&gt;

One reason for the success of this Act was that transportation was financially costly. The system of sponsorship by merchants had to be improved. Initially the government rejected Thomson's proposal to pay merchants to transport convicts, but three months after the first transportation sentences were pronounced at the Old Bailey, his suggestion was proposed again, and the Treasury contracted [[Jonathan Forward]], a London merchant, for the transportation to the colonies.&lt;ref&gt;Beattie, 2001, p. 430&lt;/ref&gt; The business was entrusted to Forward in 1718: he was paid £3 (£5 in 1727) for each prisoner transported overseas. The Treasury also paid for the transportation of prisoners from the [[Home Counties]].&lt;ref&gt;Beattie, 1986, p. 504&lt;/ref&gt;

The "Felons' Act" (as the Transportation Act was called) was printed and distributed in 1718, and in April twenty-seven men and women were sentenced to transportation&lt;ref&gt;Beattie, 2001, p. 432&lt;/ref&gt; The Act led to significant changes: both [[petty larceny|petty]] and [[grand larceny]] were punished by transportation (seven years), and the sentence for any non-capital offence was at the judge's discretion.&lt;ref&gt;Beattie, 1986, p. 506&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1723 an Act was presented in Virginia to discourage transportation by establishing complex rules for the reception of prisoners, but the reluctance of colonies did not stop transportation.&lt;ref&gt;Beattie, 1986, p. 505&lt;/ref&gt;

In a few cases before 1734, the court changed sentences of transportation to sentences of branding on the thumb or whipping, by convicting the accused for lesser crimes than those of which they were accused.&lt;ref name="Beattie, 2001, p. 435"&gt;Beattie, 2001, p. 435&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Beattie, 2001, p. 439&lt;/ref&gt; This manipulation phase came to an end in 1734. With the exception of those years, the Transportation Act led to a decrease in whipping of convicts, thus avoiding potentially inflammatory public displays. Clergyable discharge continued to be used when the accused could not be transported for reasons of age or infirmity.&lt;ref&gt;Beattie, 2001, p. 447&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sex and age===
Penal transportation was not limited to men or even to adults. Men, women, and children were sentenced to transportation, but its implementation varied by gender and age. From 1660 to 1670, highway robbery, [[burglary]], and [[horse theft]] were the offences most often punishable with transportation for men. In those years, five of the nine women who were transported after being sentenced to death were guilty of simple larceny, an offence for which [[benefit of clergy]] was not available for women until 1692.&lt;ref&gt;Beattie, 1986, p. 474&lt;/ref&gt; Also, merchants preferred young and able-bodied men for whom there was a demand in the colonies.

All these factors meant that most women and children were simply left in jail.&lt;ref name="Beattie, 1986, p. 479"/&gt; Some magistrates supported a proposal to release women who could not be transported, but this solution was considered absurd: this caused the Lords Justices to order that no distinction be made between men and women.&lt;ref&gt;Beattie, 1986, p. 483&lt;/ref&gt; Women were sent to the [[Leeward Islands]], the only colony that accepted them, and the government had to pay to send them overseas.&lt;ref&gt;Beattie, 1986, p. 482&lt;/ref&gt; In 1696 [[Jamaica]] refused to welcome a group of prisoners because most of them were women; [[Barbados]] similarly accepted convicts but not "women, children nor other infirm persons".&lt;ref&gt;Beattie, 1986, p. 481&lt;/ref&gt;

Thanks to transportation, the number of men whipped and released diminished, but whipping and discharge were chosen more often for women. The reverse was true when women were sentenced for a capital offence, but actually served a lesser sentence due to a manipulation of the penal system: One advantage of this sentence was that they could be discharged thanks to benefit of clergy while men were whipped.&lt;ref name="Beattie, 2001, p. 444"&gt;Beattie, 2001, p. 444&lt;/ref&gt; Women with young children were also supported since transportation unavoidably separated them.&lt;ref name="Beattie, 2001, p. 444"/&gt; The facts and numbers revealed how transportation was less frequently applied to women and children because they were usually guilty of minor crimes and they were considered a minimal threat to the community.&lt;ref name="Beattie, 2001, p. 435"/&gt;

===The end of transportation===
The outbreak of the [[American Revolutionary War]] (1775–1783) halted transportation to America. Parliament, claimed that "the transportation of convicts to his Majesty's colonies and plantations in America...is found to be attended with various inconveniences, particularly by depriving this kingdom of many subjects whose labour might be useful to the community, and who, by proper care and correction, might be reclaimed from their evil course"; they then passed "An act to authorize.. the punishment by hard labour of offenders who, for certain crimes, are or shall become liable to be transported to any of his Majesty's colonies and plantations.&lt;ref name="BasAsylum"&gt;Marilyn C. Baseler, [https://books.google.com/books?id=5gJ3tOl20eYC&amp;pg=PA125&amp; "Asylum for Mankind": America, 1607-1800], p.124-127&lt;/ref&gt; For the ensuing decade, men were instead sentenced to hard labour and women were imprisoned. Finding alternative locations to send convicts was not easy, and the act was extended twice by the Criminal Law Act 1778 (18 Geo. 3 c. 62) and the Criminal Law Act 1779 (19 Geo. 3, c. 54).&lt;ref&gt;Drew D. Gray, [https://books.google.com/books?id=33Y8CwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT298&amp;#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Crime, Policing and Punishment in England, 1660-1914] p.298 (2016)&lt;/ref&gt; This resulted in a 1779 inquiry by a Parliamentary Committee on the entire subject of transportation and punishment; initially the [[Penitentiary Act]] was passed, introducing a policy of state prisons as a measure to reform the system of overcrowded [[prison ship|prison hulk]]s that had developed, but no prisons were ever built as a result of the act.&lt;ref&gt;[http://discovery.nationalarchives.gov.uk/details/rd/bd7861bf-6f01-4945-8218-68eec54966c1 Penitentiary Act, 1779]&lt;/ref&gt;  The Transportation, etc. Act 1784 (24 Geo. 3 c. 56)&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=4sAuAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA732&amp;#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false "An act for the effectual transportation of felons and other offenders; and to authorize the removal of prisoners in certain cases; and for other purposes therein mentioned."]&lt;/ref&gt; and the Transportation, etc. Act 1785 (25 Geo. 3 c. 46)&lt;ref name="archive.org"/&gt; also resulted to help alleviate overcrowding. Both acts empowered the Crown to appoint certain places within his dominions, or outside them, as the destination for transported criminals; the acts would move convicts around the country as needed for labour, or where they could be utilized and accommodated.

The overcrowding situation and the resumption of transportation would be initially resolved by [[Orders in Council]] on 6 December 1785, by the decision to establish a penal colony in [[New South Wales]], on land previously claimed for Britain in 1770,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news  | url = http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article63477180  | title = Historic Landmarks| newspaper  = [[Townsville Daily Bulletin]] | location   = Qld.  | date = 2 October 1952  | accessdate = 19 March 2017  | page = 5  | publisher  = National Library of Australia  }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url  = http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article60569425  | title = Australian Discovery and Colonisation  | newspaper = [[Empire (newspaper)|The Empire]]  | location  = Sydney  | date = 14 April 1865  | page = 8  | publisher = National Library of Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt; but as yet unsettled. The British policy toward Australia, specifically for its use as a [[penal colony]], within their overall plans to populate and colonise the continent, would differentiate it from America, where the use of convicts was only a minor adjunct to its overall policy.&lt;ref name="ShHist"&gt;Hugh Edward Egerton, [https://archive.org/stream/ashorthistorybr01egergoog#page/n282/mode/2up/ A short history of British colonial policy], p.262–269 (1897)&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1787, when transportation resumed to the chosen Australian colonies, the far greater distance added to the terrible experience of exile, and it was considered more severe than the methods of imprisonment employed for the previous decade.&lt;ref name="oldbaileyonline1"&gt;{{citation |title =Punishments at the Old Bailey |url=http://www.oldbaileyonline.org/static/Punishment.jsp#transportation |publisher=Old Bailey Proceedings Online}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Transportation Act 1790 (30 Geo. 3 c. 47) officially enacted the previous orders in council into law, stating "his Majesty hath declared and appointed...that the eastern coast of New South Wales, and the islands thereunto adjacent, should be the place or places beyond the seas to which certain felons, and other offenders, should be conveyed and transported;"...or other places. The act also gave "authority to remit or shorten the time or term" of the sentence "in cases where it shall appear that such felons, or other offenders, are proper objects of the royal mercy"&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=1ITe3ogChoIC&amp;pg=PA110&amp;#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false "An act for enabling his Majesty to authorize his governor or lieutenant governor of such places beyond the seas, to which felons and others offenders may be transported, to remit the sentences of such offenders."]&lt;/ref&gt;

At the beginning of the 19th century, transportation for life became the maximum penalty for several offences which had previously been punishable by death.&lt;ref name="oldbaileyonline1"/&gt; With complaints starting in the 1830s sentences of transportation became less common in 1840 since the system was perceived to be a failure: crime continued at high levels, people were not dissuaded from committing felonies, and the conditions of convicts in the colonies were inhumane. Although a concerted program of prison building ensued, the [[Short Titles Act 1896]] lists seven other laws relating to penal transportation in the first half of the 19th century.&lt;ref name="ShTitl"&gt;[http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/eli/1896/act/14/enacted/en/print Short Titles Act 1896]&lt;/ref&gt;

The system of criminal punishment by transportation, as it had developed over nearly 150 years, was officially ended in Britain in the 1850s, when that sentence was substituted by imprisonment with [[penal labor|penal servitude]], and intended to punish. The Penal Servitude Act 1853 (16 &amp; 17 Vict. c. 99), long titled "An Act to substitute, in certain Cases, other Punishment in lieu of Transportation,"&lt;ref name="ShTitl"/&gt; enacted that with judicial discretion, lesser felonies, those subject to transportation for less than 14 years, could be sentenced to imprisonment with labour for a specific term. To provide confinement facilities, the general change in sentencing was passed in conjunction with the Convict Prisons Act 1853 (16 &amp; 17 Vict. c. 121), long titled "An Act for providing Places of Confinement in England or Wales for Female Offenders under Sentence or Order of Transportation."&lt;ref name="ShTitl"/&gt; The Penal Servitude Act 1857 (20 &amp; 21 Vict. c.3) ended the sentence of transportation in virtually all cases, with the terms of sentence initially being of the same duration as transportation.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1857/3/pdfs/ukpga_18570003_en.pdf Penal Servitude Act 1857]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="oldbaileyonline1" /&gt; While transport was greatly reduced following passage of the 1857 act, the last convicts sentenced to transportation arrived in Western Australia in 1868. During the 80 years of its use to Australia, the number of transported convicts totaled about 162,000 men and women.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.australia.gov.au/about-australia/australian-story/convicts-and-the-british-colonies Convicts and the British colonies in Australia] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160101181100/http://www.australia.gov.au/about-australia/australian-story/convicts-and-the-british-colonies |date=1 January 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Over time the alternative terms of imprisonment would be somewhat reduced from their terms of transportation.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.penandclink.com/mjmuseum/transps.htm Transportation and Penal Servitude], [[Mountjoy Prison| Mountjoy Prison Museum]]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Transportation to North America==
From the early 1600s until the [[American Revolution]] of 1776, the British colonies in North America received transported British criminals. In the 17th century transportation was carried out at the expense of the convicts or the shipowners. The [[Transportation Act 1717]] allowed courts to sentence convicts to seven years' transportation to America. In 1720, an extension authorised payments by [[the Crown]] to merchants contracted to take the convicts to America. The Transportation Act made returning from transportation a [[capital punishment|capital offence]].&lt;ref name="oldbaileyonline1" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite court|litigants= R v Powell |vol= Sixth session |reporter= Proceedings of the Old Bailey 10th July, 1805 |opinion= t18050710-23 |pinpoint= page 401 |court= [[Old Bailey]] |date= 10 July 1805 |url= http://www.oldbaileyonline.org/browse.jsp?ref=t18050710-23 | accessdate= April 2008 |mode= cs2}}&lt;/ref&gt; The number of convicts transported to North America is not verified - [[John Dunmore Lang]] has estimated 50,000, and [[Thomas Keneally]] has proposed 120,000.

The remaining British colonies (in what is now Canada) were regarded as unsuitable for various reasons, including the possibility that transportation might increase dissatisfaction with British rule among settlers and/or the possibility of [[Annexation movements of Canada|annexation by the United States]] – as well as the ease with which prisoners could escape across the border.

After the termination of transportation to North America, British prisons became overcrowded, and dilapidated ships moored in various ports were pressed into service as [[Prison ship|floating gaols]] known as "hulks".&lt;ref&gt;Oxford English Dictionary online, "Hulk" n.2, sense 3b http://www.oed.com/view/Entry/89220?rskey=416nHV&amp;result=3&amp;isAdvanced=false#eid Accessed 2017/06/26&lt;/ref&gt; Following a disastrous experiment in transporting convicted prisoners to [[Cape Coast Castle]] (modern Ghana) and the [[Gorée]] (Senegal) in West Africa,&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; British authorities turned their attention to [[New South Wales]] (in what would become Australia). 

From the 1820s until the 1860s, convicts were sent to [[Bermuda]] to work on the construction of the [[Royal Naval Dockyard, Bermuda|Royal Naval Dockyard]] and other defence works, including an area still known as "Convict Bay", at [[St. George's, Bermuda|St. George's]] town.

== Transportation to Australia ==
{{main|Convicts in Australia}}
[[Image:Dorset Sturminster Newton Bridge notice.jpg|thumb|This notice on a bridge in [[Dorset]] warns that damage to the bridge can be punished by transportation.]]
In 1787, the "[[First Fleet]]" of [[convict ship]]s departed from England to establish the first British settlement in Australia, as a penal colony. The fleet arrived at [[Port Jackson]] (Sydney) on 26 January 1788, a date now celebrated as [[Australia Day]]. [[Norfolk Island]] was a convict penal settlement from 1788–94, and again from 1824-47. The First Fleet included boats containing food and animals from London. The ships and boats of the fleet would explore the coast of Australia by sailing all around it looking for suitable farming land and resources. In 1803, [[Tasmania|Van Diemen's Land]] (modern-day Tasmania) was also settled as a penal colony, followed by the [[Queensland|Moreton Bay Settlement]] (Queensland) in 1824. The other [[States and territories of Australia|Australian colonies]] were "free settlements", as non-convict colonies were known. However, the [[Swan River Colony]] (Western Australia) accepted transportation from England and Ireland in 1851, to resolve a long-standing [[Labor shortage|labour shortage]]. Until the massive influx of immigrants during the [[Australian gold rushes]] of the 1850s, the free settlers had been outnumbered by English and Irish convicts and their descendants. However, compared to America, Australia received many more English prisoners.

Transportation from Britain and Ireland officially ended in 1868, although it had become uncommon several years earlier.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |last=McConville |first=Sean |title=A History of English Prison Administration: Volume I 1750–1877 |location=London |publisher=Boston &amp; Henley |year=1981 |pages=381–385 |isbn=0-7100-0694-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Transportation to Siberia==
During the Second World War, the Soviet Union transported up to 1.9 million people from western republics to Siberia and the Central Asian republics of the Union, mostly persons accused of treasonous collaboration with Nazi Germany, or of Anti-Soviet rebellion.&lt;ref&gt;Alexander Statiev, "The Nature of Anti-Soviet Armed Resistance, 1942–44"&lt;/ref&gt;. Populations targeted included [[Volga Germans]], [[Chechens]], and Caucasian Turkic populations. The transportations had a twofold objective - to remove potential liabilities from the warfront, and to provide human capital for the settlement and industrialization of the largely underpopulated eastern regions. The policy continued until February 1956, when [[Nikita Khrushchev]] in his speech ''[[On the Personality Cult and its Consequences]]'' condemned the transportation as a violation of [[leninism|leninist]] principles. Whilst the policy itself was rescinded, the transported populations did not begin to return to their original metropoles until after the collapse of the Soviet Union, in 1991. &lt;ref&gt;Mawdsley, Evan (1998). The Stalin Years: The Soviet Union, 1929-1953. Manchester University Press. {{ISBN|9780719046001}}. LCCN 2003046365.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other==
[[New Caledonia]] became a French penal colony from the 1860s until the end of the transportations in 1897. About 22,000 criminals and political prisoners (most notably [[Communards]]) were sent to New Caledonia.

In British [[colonial India]], opponents of British rule were transported to the [[Cellular Jail]] in the [[Andaman islands]].

The most famous transported prisoner is probably French army officer [[Alfred Dreyfus]], wrongly convicted of [[treason]] in a trial in 1894, held in an atmosphere of [[antisemitism]].  He was sent to [[Devil's Island]], a French penal colony in [[French Guiana|Guiana]].  The case became a [[cause célèbre]] known as the [[Dreyfus Affair]], and Dreyfus was fully exonerated in 1906.

==Folk Song and Literature==
Penal transportation is a feature of many [[Broadside ballads|broadsides]], and a number of these [[Transportation Ballads|transportation ballads]] have been collected from traditional singers. Examples include "[[Van Diemen's Land (folk song)|Van Diemen's Land]]," "[[The Black Velvet Band]]," and "[[The Fields of Athenry]]."

The British author [[William Somerset Maugham]] set a number of his short stories in the French Caribbean penal colonies. [[Franz Kafka]]'s story "[[In the Penal Colony]]", set in an unidentified location, was later adapted for several other media, including an opera by [[Philip Glass]].

One of the key characters in [[Charles Dickens]]' novel ''[[Great Expectations]]'' is [[Abel Magwitch]], the escaped convict who [[Pip (Great Expectations)|Pip]] helps in the opening pages of the novel, and who later turns out to be Pip's secret benefactor—the source of his "great expectations". Magwitch, who had been apprehended shortly after the young Pip had helped him, was thereafter sentenced to transportation for life to [[New South Wales]] in [[Australia]]. While so exiled, he earned the fortune that he later would use to help Pip. Further, it was Magwitch's desire to see the "gentleman" that Pip had become that motivated him to illegally return to England, which ultimately led to his arrest and death.

[[Timberlake Wertenbaker]]'s play ''[[Our Country's Good]]'', based on [[Thomas Keneally]]'s novel ''[[The Playmaker]]'', is set in the first Australian penal colony.

''My Transportation for Life'', Indian freedom fighter [[Veer Savarkar]]'s memoir of his imprisonment, is set in the British [[Cellular Jail]] in the [[Andaman Islands]].

The novel ''[[Papillon (book)|Papillon]]'' tells the story of Henri Charrière, a French criminal convicted on 26 October 1931 as a murderer, and exiled to the French Guinea penal colony on [[Devil's Island]]. A [[Papillon (1973 film)|film adaptation of the book]] was made in 1973, starring [[Steve McQueen]] and [[Dustin Hoffman]].

Penal transportation, typically to other planets, sometimes appears in works of [[science fiction]]. A classic example is ''[[The Moon is a Harsh Mistress]]'' by [[Robert Heinlein]], in which convicts and political dissidents are transported to lunar colonies. In Heinlein's book, a sentence of lunar transportation is necessarily permanent, as the long-term physiological effects of the moon's weak surface gravity (about one-sixth that of Earth) leave "loonies" unable to return safely to Earth.

The story of Essie McGowan in [[Neil Gaiman]]'s ''[[American Gods]]'' is structured around her transportation and promoting the Cornish folklore in America.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2596">'''Perceptual psychology''' is a subfield of [[cognitive psychology]]{{cn|date=February 2018}} that is concerned specifically with the pre-conscious innate aspects of the human cognitive system: [[perception]]. 

A pioneer of this field was [[James J. Gibson]]. A major study was that of [[affordance]]s, i.e. the perceived utility of objects in, or features of, one's surroundings. According to Gibson, such features or objects were perceived as affordances and not as separate or distinct objects in themselves. This view was central to several other fields as software [[user interface]] and [[usability engineering]], [[environmentalism]] in psychology, and ultimately to [[political economy]] where the perceptual view was used to explain the omission of key inputs or consequences of economic transactions, i.e. resources and wastes.

[[Gerard Egan]] and Robert Bolton explored areas of interpersonal interactions based on the premise that people act in accordance with their perception of a given situation. While behaviour is obvious, a person's thoughts and feelings are masked. This gives rise to the idea that the most common problems between people are based on the assumption that we can guess what the other person is feeling and thinking. They also offered methods, within this scope, for effective communications. This includes: [[reflective listening]], assertion skills, [[conflict resolution]] etc. Perceptual psychology is often used in therapy to help a patient better their problem-solving skills.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Wells-Moran|first=Jolyn|title=Cognitive Psychology|url=http://psychologydegree.lifetips.com/tip/130454/cognitive-psychology/cognitive-psychology/cognitive-psychology.html|publisher=lifetips|accessdate=2011-07-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Nativism vs. empiricism ==
Nativist and empiricist approaches to perceptual psychology have been researched and debated to find out which is the basis in the development of perception. Nativists believe humans are born with all the perceptual abilities needed. This is the favored of the theories on perception. Empiricists hold that humans are not born with perceptual abilities, but instead must learn them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Perceptual Psychology: Nativism Vs. Empiricism|url=http://www.essortment.com/perceptual-psychology-nativism-vs-empiricism-16772.html|accessdate=27 July 2011|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110216120030/http://www.essortment.com/perceptual-psychology-nativism-vs-empiricism-16772.html|archivedate=16 February 2011|deadurl=y}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The effect of POPs on human and environmental health was discussed, with intention to eliminate or severely restrict their production, by the international community at the [[Stockholm Convention on Persistent Organic Pollutants]] in 2001.

Many POPs are currently or were in the past used as [[pesticide]]s, [[solvent]]s, [[pharmaceutical]]s, and industrial chemicals.&lt;ref name="ritter"/&gt; Although some POPs arise naturally, for example volcanoes and various biosynthetic pathways, most are man-made&lt;ref name="El-Shahawi, M.S. 2010"&gt;El-Shahawi, M.S., Hamza, A., Bashammakhb, A.S., Al-Saggaf, W.T. (2010). An overview on the accumulation, distribution, transformations, toxicity and analytical methods for the monitoring of persistent organic pollutants. Talanta. 80, 1587–1597. {{doi|10.1016/j.talanta.2009.09.055}}.&lt;/ref&gt; via [[total synthesis]].

==Consequences of persistence==
POPs typically are halogenated organic compounds (see lists below) and as such exhibit high [[Lipophilicity|lipid solubility]].  For this reason, they [[bioaccumulation|bioaccumulate]] in [[Adipose tissue|fatty tissues]]. [[Halogenated]] compounds also exhibit great [[Chemical stability|stability]] reflecting the nonreactivity of C-Cl bonds toward [[hydrolysis]] and [[Photodissociation|photolytic degradation]].  The stability and lipophilicity of organic compounds often correlates with their halogen content, thus polyhalogenated organic compounds are of particular concern.  They exert their negative effects on the environment through two processes, long range transport, which allows them to travel far from their source, and bioaccumulation, which reconcentrates these chemical compounds to potentially dangerous levels.&lt;ref name="Walker, C.H. 2001"&gt;Walker, C.H., "Organic Pollutants: An Ecotoxicological Perspective" (2001).&lt;/ref&gt; Compounds that make up POPs are also classed as [[Persistent, bioaccumulative and toxic substances|PBTs]] ('''P'''ersistent, '''B'''ioaccumulative and '''T'''oxic) or TOMPs ('''T'''oxic '''O'''rganic '''M'''icro '''P'''ollutants).

=== Long-range transport ===
POPs enter the [[gas]] phase under certain environmental temperatures and [[Volatility (chemistry)|volatize]] from [[soil]]s, [[vegetation]], and [[bodies of water]] into the [[atmosphere]], resisting breakdown reactions in the air, to travel long distances before being re-deposited.&lt;ref name="Kelly, B.C. 2007"&gt;Kelly, B.C., Ikonomou, M.G., Blair, J.D., Morin, A.E., Gobas, F.A.P.C. (2007). Food Web-Specific Biomagnification of Persistent Organic Pollutants.

Environmental Sciences &amp; Technology. 34(4), 699–703. {{doi|10.1021/es990207w}}.&lt;/ref&gt; POPs can be present as vapors in the atmosphere or bound to the surface of solid particles. POPs have low solubility in water but are easily captured by solid particles, and are soluble in organic fluids ([[oil]]s, [[fat]]s, and [[liquid fuel]]s). POPs are not easily degraded in the environment due to their stability and low [[Chemical decomposition|decomposition]] rates. Due to this capacity for long-range transport, POP environmental contamination is extensive, even in areas where POPs have never been used, and will remain in these environments years after restrictions implemented due to their resistance to degradation.&lt;ref name="Wania, F. 1996"&gt;Wania, F., [[Donald Mackay (scientist)|Mackay, D.]] (1996).

=== Bioaccumulation ===
[[Bioaccumulation]] of POPs is typically associated with the compounds high lipid solubility and ability to accumulate in the [[adipose tissue|fatty tissues]] of living organisms for long periods of time.&lt;ref name="Wania, F. 1996"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Vallack, H.W. 1998"&gt;Vallack, H.W., Bakker, D.J., Brandt, I., Broström-Ludén, E., Brouwer, A., Bull, K.R., Gough, C., Guardans, R., Holoubek, I., Jansson, B., Koch, R., Kuylenstierna, J., Lecloux, A., Mackay, D., McCutcheon, P., Mocarelli, P., Taalman, R.D.F. (1998). Controlling persistent organic pollutants – what next? Environmental Toxicology and Pharmacology 6, 143–175. {{doi|10.1016/S1382-6689(98)00036-2}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Persistent chemicals tend to have higher concentrations and are eliminated more slowly. Dietary accumulation or [[bioaccumulation]] is another hallmark characteristic of POPs, as POPs move up the food chain, they increase in concentration as they are processed and metabolized in certain tissues of organisms. The natural capacity for animals [[Human gastrointestinal tract|gastrointestinal tract]] concentrate ingested chemicals, along with poorly [[Metabolism|metabolized]] and [[hydrophobic]] nature of POPs makes such compounds highly susceptible to [[bioaccumulation]].&lt;ref&gt;Yu, G.W.,, Laseter, J., Mylander, C.

== Stockholm Convention on Persistent Organic Pollutants ==
[[File:Map of Stockholm Convention on Persistent Organic Pollutants.svg|thumb|275px|State parties to the Stockholm Convention on Persistent Organic Pollutants]]
{{Main|Stockholm Convention on Persistent Organic Pollutants}}

The Stockholm Convention was adopted and put into practice by the [[United Nations Environment Programme]] (UNEP) on May 22, 2001. The UNEP decided that POP regulation needed to be addressed globally for the future. The purpose statement of the agreement is "to protect human health and the environment from persistent organic pollutants." As of 2014, there are 179 countries in compliance with the Stockholm convention. The convention and its participants have recognized the potential human and environmental toxicity of POPs. They recognize that POPs have the potential for long range transport and bioaccumulation and biomagnification. The convention seeks to study and then judge whether or not a number of chemicals that have been developed with advances in technology and science can be categorized as POPs or not. The initial meeting in 2001 made a preliminary list, termed the "dirty dozen," of chemicals that are classified as POPs. As of 2014, the [[United States of America]] has signed the Stockholm Convention but has not ratified it. There are a handful of other countries that have not ratified the convention but most countries in the world have ratified the convention.&lt;ref&gt;"STOCKHOLM CONVENTION ON PERSISTENT ORGANIC POLLUTANTS". pp. 1–43.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Compounds on the Stockholm Convention list ===

In May 1995, the [[United Nations Environment Programme]] Governing Council investigated POPs.&lt;ref name="thedirtydozen"&gt;{{cite web|title=The Dirty Dozen|url=http://www.unido.org/fileadmin/import/29239_popspresentation.swf|publisher=United Nations Industrial Development Organization|accessdate=27 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Initially the Convention recognized only twelve POPs for their adverse effects on human health and the environment, placing a global ban on these particularly harmful and toxic compounds and requiring its parties to take measures to eliminate or reduce the release of POPs in the environment.
&lt;ref name="El-Shahawi, M.S. 2010"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://chm.pops.int/Portals/0/Repository/convention_text/UNEP-POPS-COP-CONVTEXT-FULL.English.PDF| title=STOCKHOLM CONVENTION ON PERSISTENT ORGANIC POLLUTANTS| pages=1–43| accessdate=27 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://chm.pops.int/&lt;/ref&gt;

#'''[[Aldrin]]''', an insecticide used in soils to kill [[termite]]s, [[grasshopper]]s, [[Western corn rootworm]], and others, is also known to kill birds, fish, and humans. Humans are primarily exposed to aldrin through dairy products and animal meats.
#'''[[Chlordane]]''', an insecticide used to control termites and on a range of agricultural crops, is known to be lethal in various species of birds, including mallard ducks, bobwhite quail, and pink shrimp; it is a chemical that remains in the soil with a reported [[half-life]] of one year. Chlordane has been postulated to affect the human immune system and is classified as a possible human [[carcinogen]]. Chlordane air pollution is believed the primary route of humane exposure.
#'''[[Dieldrin]]''', a pesticide used to control termites, textile pests, insect-borne diseases and insects living in agricultural soils. In soil and insects, aldrin can be oxidized, resulting in rapid conversion to dieldrin. Dieldrin’s half-life is approximately five years. [[Dieldrin]] is highly toxic to fish and other aquatic animals, particularly frogs, whose embryos can develop spinal deformities after exposure to low levels. Dieldrin has been linked to [[Parkinson's disease]], [[breast cancer]], and classified as immunotoxic, neurotoxic, with endocrine disrupting capacity. Dieldrin residues have been found in air, water, soil, fish, birds, and mammals. Human exposure to dieldrin primarily derives from food.
#'''[[Endrin]]''', an insecticide sprayed on the leaves of crops, and used to control rodents. Animals can metabolize endrin, so fatty tissue accumulation is not an issue, however the chemical has a long half-life in soil for up to 12 years. Endrin is highly toxic to aquatic animals and humans as a neurotoxin. Human exposure results primarily through food.
#'''[[Heptachlor]]''', a [[pesticide]] primarily used to kill soil insects and termites, along with cotton insects, grasshoppers, other crop pests, and malaria-carrying mosquitoes. Heptachlor, even at every low doses has been associated with the decline of several wild bird populations – [[Canada goose|Canada geese]] and [[American kestrel]]s. In laboratory tests have shown high-dose heptachlor as lethal, with adverse behavioral changes and reduced reproductive success at low-doses, and is classified as a possible human carcinogen. Human exposure primarily results from food.
#'''[[Hexachlorobenzene]] (HCB'''), was first introduced in 1945–59 to treat seeds because it can kill [[Fungicide|fungi]] on food crops. HCB-treated seed grain consumption is associated with photosensitive skin lesions, [[colic]], debilitation, and a [[Metabolic syndrome|metabolic disorder]] called porphyria turcica, which can be lethal. Mothers who pass HCB to their infants through the placenta and breast milk had limited reproductive success including infant death. Human exposure is primarily from food.
#'''[[Mirex]]''', an insecticide used against ants and termites or as a [[flame retardant]] in plastics, rubber, and electrical goods. Mirex is one of the most stable and persistent pesticides, with a half-life of up to 10 years.  Mirex is toxic to several plant, fish and [[crustacean]] species, with suggested carcinogenic capacity in humans. Humans are exposed primarily through animal meat, fish, and wild game.
#'''[[Toxaphene]]''', an insecticide used on cotton, cereal, grain, fruits, nuts, and vegetables, as well as for tick and mite control in livestock. Widespread toxaphene use in the US and chemical persistence, with a half-life of up to 12 years in soil, results in residual toxaphene in the environment. Toxaphene is highly toxic to fish, inducing dramatic weight loss and reduced egg viability. Human exposure primarily results from food. While human toxicity to direct toxaphene exposure is low, the compound is classified as a possible human carcinogen.
#'''[[Polychlorinated biphenyls]]''' (PCBs), used as [[Heat-transfer oil|heat exchange fluids]], in [[transformer|electrical transformers]], and [[capacitor]]s, and as additives in paint, carbonless copy paper, and plastics. Persistence varies with degree of [[halogenation]], an estimated half-life of 10 years. PCBs are toxic to fish at high doses, and associated with spawning failure at low doses. Human exposure occurs through food, and is associated with reproductive failure and immune suppression. Immediate effects of PCB exposure include pigmentation of nails and [[mucous membranes]] and swelling of the eyelids, along with fatigue, nausea, and vomiting. Effects are [[Transgenerational epigenetics|transgenerational]], as the chemical can persist in a mother’s body for up to 7 years, resulting in developmental delays and behavioral problems in her children. Food contamination has led to large scale PCB exposure.
#[[DDT|'''Dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane''']] (DDT) is probably the most infamous POP. It was widely used as insecticide during WWII to protect against malaria and typhus. After the war, DDT was used as an agricultural insecticide. In 1962, the American biologist [[Rachel Carson]] published [[Silent Spring]], describing the impact of DDT spraying on the US environment and human health. DDT’s persistence in the soil for up to 10–15 years after application has resulted in widespread and persistent DDT residues throughout the world including the arctic, even though it has been banned or severely restricted in most of the world. DDT is toxic to many organisms including birds where it is detrimental to reproduction due to eggshell thinning. DDT can be detected in foods from all over the world and food-borne DDT remains the greatest source of human exposure. Short-term acute effects of DDT on humans are limited, however long-term exposure has been associated with chronic health effects including increased risk of cancer and diabetes, reduced reproductive success, and neurological disease.
#'''[[Dioxins]]''' are unintentional by-products of high-temperature processes, such as incomplete combustion and pesticide production. Dioxins are typically emitted from the burning of hospital waste, municipal waste, and [[hazardous waste]], along with automobile emissions, peat, coal, and wood. Dioxins have been associated with several adverse effects in humans, including immune and enzyme disorders, [[chloracne]], and are classified as a possible human carcinogen. In laboratory studies of dioxin effects an increase in birth defects and stillbirths, and lethal exposure have been associated with the substances. Food, particularly from animals, is the principal source of human exposure to dioxins.
#'''[[Polychlorinated dibenzofurans]]''' are by-products of high-temperature processes, such as incomplete [[combustion]] after [[Incineration|waste incineration]] or in automobiles, pesticide production, and [[polychlorinated biphenyl]] production. Structurally similar to dioxins, the two compounds share toxic effects. Furans persist in the environment and classified as possible human carcinogens. Human exposure to furans primarily results from food, particularly animal products.

=== New POPs on the Stockholm Convention list ===
Since 2001, this list has been expanded to include some [[polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons]] (PAHs), [[brominated flame retardant]]s, and other compounds. Additions to the initial 2001 Stockholm Convention list are as following POPs:&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | title = Depositary notification | url = http://chm.pops.int/Portals/0/download.aspx?d=UNEP-POPS-COP-NOTIF-DN-CN524-2009.English.pdf | publisher = Secretary-General of the United Nations | date = 26 August 2009 | accessdate = 2009-12-17}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://treaties.un.org/doc/Publication/CN/2013/CN.934.2013-Eng.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Chlordecone]], a synthetic chlorinated organic compound,is primarily used as an agricultural pesticide, related to DDT and Mirex. Chlordecone is toxic to aquatic organisms, and classified as a possible human carcinogen. Many countries have banned chlordecone sale and use, or intend to phase out stockpiles and wastes.
*[[alpha-Hexachlorocyclohexane|α-Hexachlorocyclohexane]] (α-HCH) and [[beta-Hexachlorocyclohexane|β-Hexachlorocyclohexane]] (β-HCH) are insecticides as well as by-products in the production of [[lindane]].  Large stockpiles of HCH isomers exist in the environment. α-HCH and β-HCH are highly persistent in the water of colder regions. α-HCH and β-HCH has been linked [[Parkinson's disease|Parkinson's]] and [[Alzheimer's disease]].{{citation needed|date=April 2015}}
*[[Hexabromodiphenyl ether]] (hexaBDE) and [[heptabromodiphenyl ether]] (heptaBDE) are main components of commercial [[octabromodiphenyl ether]] (octaBDE). Commercial octaBDE is highly persistent in the environment, whose only degradation pathway is through debromination and the production of [[Bromodiphenylmethane|bromodiphenyl ethers]], which can increase toxicity.
*[[Lindane]] (γ-hexachlorocyclohexane), a pesticide used as a broad spectrum insecticide for seed, soil, leaf, tree and wood treatment, and against [[ectoparasite]]s in animals and humans (head lice and scabies). Lindane rapidly [[Bioconcentration|bioconcentrates]]. It is [[Immunotoxin|immunotoxic]], [[Neurotoxicity|neurotoxic]], [[carcinogenic]], linked to liver and kidney damage as well as adverse reproductive and developmental effects in laboratory animals and aquatic organisms. Production of lindane unintentionally produces two other POPs α-HCH and β-HCH.{{citation needed|date=April 2015}}
*[[Pentachlorobenzene]] (PeCB), is a pesticide and unintentional byproduct. PeCB has also been used in PCB products, dyestuff carriers, as a fungicide, a flame retardant, and a chemical intermediate. PeCB is moderately toxic to humane, while highly toxic to aquatic organisms.
*[[Tetrabromodiphenyl ether]] (tetraBDE) and pentabromodiphenyl ether (pentaBDE) are industrial chemicals and the main components of commercial pentabromodiphenyl ether (pentaBDE). PentaBDE has been detected in humans in all regions of the world.
*[[Perfluorooctanesulfonic acid]] (PFOS) and its salts are used in the production of fluoropolymers. PFOS and related compounds are extremely persistent, bioaccumulating and [[Biomagnification|biomagnifying]].  The negative effects of trace levels of PFOS have not been established.
*[[Endosulfan]]s are insecticides to control pests on crops such coffee, cotton, rice and sorghum and soybeans, tsetse flies, ectoparasites of cattle. They are used as a [[Wood preservation|wood preservative]]. Global use and manufacturing of endosulfan has been banned under the Stockholm convention in 2011, although many countries had previously banned or introduced phase-outs of the chemical when the ban was announced. Toxic to humans and aquatic and terrestrial organisms, linked to congenital physical disorders, mental retardation, and death. Endosulfans' negative health effects are primarily liked to its endocrine disrupting capacity acting as an [[antiandrogen]].
*[[Hexabromocyclododecane]] (HBCD) is a [[brominated flame retardant]] primarily used in [[thermal insulation]] in the building industry. HBCD is persistent, toxic and [[Ecotoxicity|ecotoxic]], with [[bioaccumulative]] and long-range transport properties.

== Additive and synergistic effects ==
Evaluation of the effects of POPs on health is very challenging in the laboratory setting. For example, for organisms exposed to a mixture of POPs, the effects are assumed to be [[interaction|additive]].&lt;ref name="Harrad, S. 2010"&gt;ed. Harrad, S., "Persistent Organic Pollutants" (2010).&lt;/ref&gt; Mixtures of POPs can in principle produce [[interaction|synergistic effects]]. With synergistic effects, the toxicity of each compound is enhanced (or depressed) by the presence of other compounds in the mixture. When put together, the effects can far exceed the approximated additive effects of the POP compound mixture.&lt;ref name="Walker, C.H. 2001"/&gt;

== Health effects ==
POP exposure may cause developmental defects, chronic illnesses, and death. Some are carcinogens per [[International Agency for Research on Cancer|IARC]], possibly including [[breast cancer]].&lt;ref name="ritter"/&gt; Many POPs are capable of [[endocrine disruption]] within the [[reproductive system]], the [[central nervous system]], or the [[immune system]]. People and animals are exposed to POPs mostly through their diet, occupationally, or while growing in the womb.&lt;ref name="ritter"/&gt;  For humans not exposed to POPs through accidental or occupational means, over 90% of exposure comes from animal product foods due to bioaccumulation in fat tissues and bioaccumulate through the food chain. In general, POP serum levels increase with age and tend to be higher in females than males.&lt;ref name="Vallack, H.W. 1998"/&gt;

Studies have investigated the correlation between low level exposure of POPs and various diseases. In order to assess disease risk due to POPs in a particular location, government agencies may produce a [[human health risk assessment]] which takes into account the pollutants' [[bioavailability]] and their [[dose-response relationship]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Szabo DT, Loccisano AE |title= POPs and Human Health Risk Assessment|journal=Dioxins and Persistent Organic Pollutants |volume=3rd |pages= 579|editor= A. Schecter|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|date= March 30, 2012| doi= 10.1002/9781118184141.ch19 |url= http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/9781118184141.ch19/summary |isbn= 9781118184141}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Endocrine disruption ===
The majority of POPs are known to disrupt normal functioning of the endocrine system. Low level exposure to POPs during critical [[developmental biology|developmental]] periods of fetus, newborn and child can have a lasting effect throughout its lifespan. A 2002 study&lt;ref name="Damstra, T. 2002"&gt;Damstra, T. (2002). Potential Effects of Certain Persistent Organic Pollutants and Endocrine Disrupting Chemicals on Health of Children. ''Clinical Toxicology''. 40(4), 457–465.&lt;/ref&gt; synthesizes data on endocrine disruption and health complications from exposure to POPs during critical developmental stages in an organism’s lifespan. The study aimed to answer the question whether or not chronic, low level exposure to POPs can have a health impact on the endocrine system and development of organisms from different species. The study found that exposure of POPs during a critical developmental time frame can produce a permanent changes in the organisms path of development. Exposure of POPs during non-critical developmental time frames may not lead to detectable diseases and health complications later in their life. In wildlife, the critical development time frames are [[in utero]], [[in ovo]], and during reproductive periods. In humans, the critical development timeframe is during [[prenatal development|fetal development]].&lt;ref&gt;Damstra, T. (2002). Potential Effects of Certain Persistent Organic Pollutants and Endocrine Disrupting Chemicals on Health of Children. ''Clinical Toxicology''. 40(4), 457–465&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Reproductive system ===
The same study in 2002&lt;ref name="Damstra, T. 2002"/&gt; with evidence of a link from POPs to [[endocrine disruptor|endocrine disruption]] also linked low dose exposure of POPs to [[reproductive health]] effects. The study stated that POP exposure can lead to negative health effects especially in the [[human male reproductive system|male reproductive system]], such as decreased [[sperm]] quality and quantity, altered sex ratio and early [[puberty]] onset. For females exposed to POPs, altered [[human female reproductive system|reproductive tissues]] and [[pregnancy]] outcomes as well as [[endometriosis]] have been reported.&lt;ref&gt;El-Shahawi, M.S., Hamza, A., Bashammakhb, A.S., Al-Saggaf, W.T. (2010). An overview on the accumulation, distribution, transformations, toxicity and analytical methods for the monitoring of persistent organic pollutants. Talanta. 80, 1587–1597&lt;/ref&gt;

====Gestational weight gain and newborn head circumference====
A Greek study from 2014 investigated the link between maternal weight gain during pregnancy, their [[polychlorinated biphenyl|PCB]]-exposure level and PCB level in their newborn infants, their [[birth weight]], [[gestational age]], and head circumference. The lower the birth weight and head circumference of the infants was, the higher POP levels during [[prenatal development]] had been, but only if mothers had either excessive or inadequate weight gain during pregnancy. No correlation between POP exposure and gestational age was found.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Vafeiadi|first=M|author2=Vrijheid M |author3=Fthenou E |author4=Chalkiadaki G |author5=Rantakokko P |author6=Kiviranta H |author7=Kyrtopoulos SA |author8=Chatzi L |author9=Kogevinas M  |title=Persistent organic pollutants exposure during pregnancy, maternal gestational weight gain, and birth outcomes in the mother-child cohort in Crete, Greece (RHEA study)|journal=Environ Int.|year=2014|volume=64|pages=116–123|doi=10.1016/j.envint.2013.12.015|pmid=24389008}}&lt;/ref&gt;
A 2013 [[case-control study]] conducted 2009 in Indian mothers and their offspring showed prenatal exposure of two types of [[organochlorine pesticides]] ([[Hexachlorocyclohexane|HCH]], [[DDT]] and [[Dichlorodiphenyldichloroethylene|DDE]]) impaired the growth of the [[fetus]], reduced the birth weight, length, head circumference and chest circumference.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Dewan|first=Jain V,|author2=Gupta P |author3=Banerjee BD. |title=Organochlorine pesticide residues in maternal blood, cord blood, placenta, and breastmilk and their relation to birth size|journal=Chemosphere|date=February 2013|volume=90|issue=5|pages=1704–1710|doi= 10.1016/j.chemosphere.2012.09.083|pmid=23141556|bibcode=2013Chmsp..90.1704D}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Damstra, T. (2002). Potential Effects of Certain Persistent Organic Pollutants and Endocrine Disrupting Chemicals on Health of Children. ''Clinical Toxicology''. 40(4), 457–465. {{PMID|12216998}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

== In urban areas and indoor environments ==
Traditionally it was thought that human exposure to POPs occurred primarily through [[food]], however [[Indoor air quality|indoor pollution]] patterns that characterize certain POPs have challenged this notion. Recent studies of indoor [[dust]] and [[Atmosphere of Earth|air]] have implicated indoor environments as a major sources for human exposure via inhalation and ingestion.&lt;ref&gt;Walker, C.H., "Organic Pollutants: An Ecotoxicological Perspective" (2001)&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, significant indoor POP pollution must be a major route of human POP exposure, considering the modern trend in spending larger proportions of life indoor. Several studies have shown that indoor (air and dust) POP levels to exceed outdoor (air and soil) POP concentrations.&lt;ref name="Harrad, S. 2010"/&gt;

== Control and removal in the environment ==
Current studies aimed at minimizing POPs in the environment are investigating their behavior in [[photocatalysis|photo catalytic oxidation reactions]].  POPs that are found in humans and in [[aquatic ecosystem|aquatic environments]] the most are the main subjects of these experiments. [[aromatic compound|Aromatic]] and [[aliphatic compound|aliphatic]] degradation products have been identified in these reactions. [[photocatalysis|Photochemical degradation]] is negligible compared to photocatalytic degradation.&lt;ref&gt;El-Shahawi, M.S., Hamza, A., Bashammakhb, A.S., Al-Saggaf, W.T. (2010). An overview on the accumulation, distribution, transformations, toxicity and analytical methods for the monitoring of persistent organic pollutants. Talanta. 80, 1587–1597. {{DOI|10.1016/j.talanta.2009.09.055}}&lt;/ref&gt; A method of removal of POPs from marine environments that has been explored is adsorption. It occurs when an absorbable solute comes into contact with a solid with a porous surface structure. This technique was investigated by Mohamed Nageeb Rashed of Aswan University, Egypt. &lt;ref&gt;Rashed, M.N. ''Organic pollutants - Monitoring, risk and treatment''. Intech. London (2013). Chapter 7 - Adsorption techniques for the removal of presistent organic pollutants from water and wastewater. &lt;/ref&gt; Current efforts are more focused on banning the use and production of POPs worldwide rather than removal of POPs.&lt;ref&gt;Vallack, H.W., Bakker, D.J., Brandt, I., Broström-Ludén, E., Brouwer, A., Bull, K.R., Gough, C., Guardans, R., Holoubek, I., Jansson, B., Koch, R., Kuylenstierna, J., Lecloux, A., Mackay, D., McCutcheon, P., Mocarelli, P., Taalman, R.D.F. (1998). Controlling persistent organic pollutants – what next? Environmental Toxicology and Pharmacology 6, 143–175. {{DOI|10.1016/S1382-6689(98)00036-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10352">'''Psychological mindedness''' refers to a person's capacity for self-examination, self-reflection, [[introspection]] and personal [[insight]]. It includes an ability to recognize meanings that underlie overt words and actions, to appreciate emotional nuance and complexity, to recognize the links between past and present, and insight into one's own and others' motives and  intentions.  Psychologically minded people have above average insight into mental life.

Conceptual definitions of psychological mindedness have included variant, but related descriptions. Some definitions relate solely to the self, "a person's ability to see relationships among [[thought]]s, [[emotion|feeling]]s, and actions with the goal of learning the meanings and causes of his [[experience]]s and [[behavior]]s".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Appelbaum SA |title=Psychological-mindedness: word, concept and essence |journal=The International journal of psycho-analysis |volume=54 |issue=1 |pages=35–46 |year=1973 |pmid=4724251}}&lt;/ref&gt; Conte (1996) extended the concept beyond self-focus, as involving "... both self-understanding and an interest in the motivation and behavior of others".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Conte HR, Ratto R, Karusa T | year = 1996 | title = The Psychological Mindedness Scale: Factor structure and relationship to outcome of psychotherapy |url=http://jppr.psychiatryonline.org/cgi/content/abstract/5/3/250 | journal = Journal of Psychotherapy Practice and Research | volume = 5 | issue = 3| pages = 250–259 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Hall's (1992) definition introduces the multidimensional nature of PM. She defined it as "reflectivity about psychological processes, relationships and meanings [that] is displayed by ... both interest in and ability for such reflectivity across affective and intellectual dimensions".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Hall JA |title=Psychological-mindedness: a conceptual model |journal=American journal of psychotherapy |volume=46 |issue=1 |pages=131–40 |year=1992 |pmid=1543250 |doi=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== PDM description ==

The ''[[Psychodynamic Diagnostic Manual]]'' (PDM) describes psychological mindedness as an individual's ability to observe and reflect on his or her own internal life. The PDM details a four-point scale from high to low psychological mindedness, or 'healthy-to-impaired functioning'.

# Can reflect on (i.e. observe and experience at the same time) a full range of own and others' feelings or experiences (including subtle variations in feelings). Can reflect both in the present and with reference to a longer-term view of self, values, and goals. Can reflect on multiple relationships between feelings and experiences, across the full range of age-expected experiences in the context of new challenges.
# Can reflect on feelings or experiences of self and others both in the present and with reference to a longer-term view of a sense of self, values, and goals for ''some'' age-expected experiences, but not others. Cannot be reflective in this way when feelings are strong.
# Can reflect on moment-to-moment experiences, but not with reference to a longer-term sense of self and experiences, values, and goals.
# Unable to reflect genuinely on feelings or experiences, even in the present. Self-awareness consists often of polarized feeling states or simple basic feelings without an appreciation of subtle variations in feelings. Self-awareness is lacking, and there may be a tendency toward fragmentation.&lt;ref&gt;PDM Task Force. (2006). Psychodynamic Diagnostic Manual. Silver Spring, MD: Alliance of Psychoanalytic Organizations. p.82&lt;/ref&gt;

== Personality correlates ==
Psychological mindedness (PM) is expected to be related to psychological strength and negatively related to weakness.  One study found a [[correlation]] between PM and two of the [[Big Five personality traits]] ([[Extraversion and introversion|extraversion]] and [[openness to experience]]) and a negative correlation with [[neuroticism]].&lt;ref name = Beitel2003&gt;{{cite journal | last = Beitel | first = M |author2=Cecero JJ  | year = 2003 | title = Predicting psychological mindedness from personality style and attachment security | journal = Journal of Clinical Psychology | doi = 10.1002/jclp.10125 | volume = 59 | issue = 1 | pages = 163–72 | pmid = 12508339 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Other studies have linked it to the tolerance of ambiguity,&lt;ref name = Beitel2004&gt;{{cite journal | last = Beitel | first = M |author2=Cecero JJ |author3=Ferrer E  | year = 2004 | title = Psychological mindedness and cognitive style | journal = Journal of Clinical Psychology | doi = 10.1002/jclp.10258 | volume = 60 | issue = 6 | pages = 567–82 | pmid = 15141393 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Mindfulness (psychology)|mindfulness]], [[empathy]]&lt;ref name = Beitel2005&gt;{{cite journal | last = Beitel | first = M |author2=Cecero JJ |author3=Ferrer E  | year = 2005 | title = Psychological mindedness and awareness of self and others | journal = Journal of Clinical Psychology | doi = 10.1002/jclp.20095 | volume = 61 | issue = 6 | pages = 739–50 | pmid = 15546143 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and positive adjustment to college.&lt;ref name = Beitel2008&gt;{{cite journal | last = Beitel | first = M |author2=Cecero JJ |author3=Prout T | year = 2008 | title = Exploring the relationships among early maladaptive schemas, psychological mindedness and self-reported college adjustment | journal = Psychology and psychotherapy | volume = 81 | issue = 1 | pages = 105–18 |url=http://www.biomedexperts.com/Abstract.bme/17588307/Exploring_the_relationships_among_early_maladaptive_schemas_psychological_mindedness_and_self-reported_college_adjustme | doi = 10.1348/147608307X216177 | pmid = 17588307 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  PM has also been associated negatively with problem-oriented psychological constructs such as the personality factor of [[neuroticism]],&lt;ref name = Beitel2003/&gt; the cognitive constructs of [[magical thinking]] and [[external locus of control]],&lt;ref name = Beitel2004/&gt; and early maladaptive [[Schema (psychology)|schemas]].&lt;ref name = Beitel2008/&gt;  Low PM has also been linked to [[alexithymia]], suggesting that certain [[clinical psychology|clinical]] patients do not respond to counseling due to a lack of PM.&lt;ref name=Taylor1997&gt;{{cite book |author1=Piper, WB |author2=McCallum, M |title=Psychological mindedness: a contemporary understanding |publisher=[[Taylor and Francis|Lawrence Erlbaum Associates]] |location=Hillsdale, N.J |year=1997 |pages=77–104 |isbn=0-8058-1722-0 |oclc= |doi= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== In groups, environments and society ==
In the UK a lot of work has been done to extend the concept of psychological mindedness beyond the individual. This work recognises that the health and success of families, schools, hospitals, businesses, communities and indeed society as a whole depends in a large part on the psychological mindedness of the system or environment created by that institution. This is more than the sum of the individual parts. For example, an individual nurse on a psychiatric ward may be psychologically minded and motivated to connect with a service user who may also have some psychological mindedness. However, the chances of two such individuals having a psychologically minded encounter can easily be sabotaged by a "psychologically blind" or "alexithymic" care system that allows the nurse no time, no headspace, no structure and no back up to function in this way. It is well known that nurses on chaotic psychiatric wards have to shut off emotionally just to survive personally in the face of the overwhelming demands placed upon them. Once this happens the experience for the service user will obviously become one of "not being listened to". This real emotional neglect coupled with transference factors is what leads to so many incidents on our psychiatric wards. Service users who feel rejected are bound to escalate their behaviour in order to be heard and in order to "hit back" at those who are in effect just repeating the failures of past caregivers.

Martin Seager&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Seager | first1= M. |title=The Concept of "Psychologcal Safety" - A psychoanalytically informed contribution towards "safe, sound and supportive" mental health services|journal=Psychoanalytic Psychotherapy|volume =20|issue=4|date=December 2006|pages= 266–280 | doi=10.1080/02668730601020291  }}&lt;/ref&gt; (2006) developed the concept of "psychological safety" to explain and address these kinds of problems in health care systems. Out of this work, Martin was invited by the then secretary of state for health, [[Patricia Hewitt]], to form in 2007 a "national advisory group" on the universal psychological principles and standards underpinning good mental health care. Martin was able to convene a group of distinguished thinkers from the full range of psychological approaches to produce a guiding document. Group members included [[Susie Orbach]], [[Andrew Samuels]], Lucy Johnstone and [[Valerie Sinason]]. The core recommendations of this group took account of all psychological theory and spiritual factors in the human condition. "Psychological mindedness" was the concept and the phrase that seemed to bind everything together. This work has led to the formation of a further national working group (2008) on the back of the [[Improving Access to Psychological Therapies]] (IAPT) initiative in the UK. This new working group is looking at "10 high impact changes" for mental health policy in the UK that will increase psychological mindedness. The group aims to stimulate a proactive public health psychological policy that will address the relational and environmental causes of mental health problems and shift the emphasis away from an exclusive focus on reactive psychological treatments. It was found that females tend to be more psychologically minded than males.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Shill|title=The Psychological Mindedness Scale: factor structure, convergent validity and gender in a non-psychiatric sample.| pmid=12396760 | doi=10.1348/147608302169607|volume=75|issue=Pt 2|date=June 2002|journal=Psychol Psychother|pages=131–50}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Punya ''' ([[Sanskrit]]: पुण्य) is a difficult word to translate; there is no equivalent English word to convey its exact intended meaning. It is generally taken to mean 'saintly', virtue, 'holy', 'sacred', 'pure', 'good', 'meritorious', 'virtuous', 'righteous', 'just', 'auspicious', 'lucky', 'favourable', 'agreeable', 'pleasing', 'lovely', 'beautiful', 'sweet', 'fragrant', 'solemn' or 'festive', according to the context it is used.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Practical Sanskrit-English Dictionary|author=V.S.Apte|publisher=Digital Dictionaries of South Asia|page=128|url= http://dsalsrv02.uchicago.edu/cgi-bin/philologic/contextualize.pl?p.3.apte.2518608 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  

==Overview==
''Punya'' (पुण्य,) is referred to as good ''[[karma]]'' or a virtue that contributes benefits in this and the next birth and can be acquired by appropriate means and also accumulated. In [[Vedanta]] terms ''punya'' is the invisible wealth, a part of ''dharma'', the third human goal; the other two goals being ''artha'' and ''kama''. ''Punya'' and ''pāpa'' are the seeds of future pleasure and pain, the former, which sows merits, exhausts itself only through pleasure and the latter, which sows demerits, exhausts itself only through pain; but ''[[Moksha|Jiwan mukti]]'' ends all karmic debts consisting of and signified by these two dynamics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Be Free from “Me”|author=Paul Bahder|publisher=Vision of Vedanta|page=|url= https://books.google.co.in/books?id=PdGwAAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT185&amp;dq=punya&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=irvNVPzTPMze8AW284DoCQ&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=punya&amp;f=false }}&lt;/ref&gt; 

During the [[Vedic]] period, ''[[brahmacharya]]'' practiced by the [[Brahmin]]s was believed to ensure the desired gain of eternal life but owing to the changes in living patterns and increase in the demands of life, people veered towards Brahmaloka which the accumulation of merits of ''punya-karma'' ('good deeds or actions') seemed to promise and opted for the ''deva-yāna'' or 'the path of the gods'. The dynamics of ''karma'' played a large role in the development of [[Buddhist|Buddhist thought]]. The Buddhists believe that ''karma'' determines one’s nature and life-pattern but to them ''karma'' is ''chetnā'', a mental drive, a psychological phenomenon rather than a law governing substantial existence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Karma and Rebirth|publisher=SUNY Press|pages=192, 194|url= https://books.google.co.in/books?id=iaRWtgXjplQC&amp;pg=PA192&amp;dq=punya+indian+thought&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=8LvNVPbUC4bd8AXtmYKYCg&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=punya%20indian%20thought&amp;f=false }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Buddhists consider Punya as the extraordinary force that confers happiness, as a spiritual merit which is one of the ten forms of balas (sources of strength) to a bodhisattva. They hold the belief that charity leads to the accumulation of punya or a happier rebirth on earth or a long sojourn in heaven. Buddha-knowledge (enlightenment) transcends even the law of karma.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Boddhisttava Doctrine in Buddhist Sanskrit Literature|author=Har Dayal|publisher=Motilal Banarsidass|pages=61, 148|url= https://books.google.co.in/books?id=uUveqp7lAVoC&amp;pg=PA189&amp;dq=punya&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=KLvNVP__GNPk8AWM0IGACg&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=punya&amp;f=false }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The principle of ''[[Sthiti|Sthiti Bandha]]'' (duration-quality bondage), according to [[Jainism]], involves attachment of ''[[Karma in Jainism|karmic matter]]'' to the soul through ''anubhava bandha'' or ''rasa bandha'' which refers to the determination of the fruits of actions of the soul that such an attachment produces at the time of attachment of ''karmic matter'' or through ''pradesha bandha'' that deals with the quantum of ''karmic matter'' drawn towards the soul as determined by the soul’s actions. The ''karmic matter'' produced due to good activities of the mind, body and speech is the pleasant ''punya'' ('virtuous') ''karmic matter'' and that produced due to evil activities is the unpleasant ''pāpa'' ('sinful') ''karmic matter''. These ''karmas'' have to exhaust themselves to produce their results.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Jainism and Indian Civilization|publisher=Discovery Publishing House|page=50|url= https://books.google.co.in/books?id=LlqOvvJJnugC&amp;pg=PA50&amp;dq=punya+indian+thought&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=8LvNVPbUC4bd8AXtmYKYCg&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=punya%20indian%20thought&amp;f=false }}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The [[Nyaya|Nyāya School]] understands ''[[dharma]]'' and ''[[adharma]]'' to refer to ''punya'' and ''pāpa'', with ''punya'' relating to one’s own or others’ well-being and ''pāpa'' relating to harm done to others, or in terms of doing one’s duties and their violation; it connects ''dharma'' to well-being and duty.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Philosophical Reflections|author=Ved Prakash Verma|publisher=Allied Publishers|page=43|url= https://books.google.co.in/books?id=3ol1hObCEwoC&amp;pg=PA43&amp;dq=punya+upanishad&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=173NVJaMGo7y8QW41YHgCQ&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=punya%20upanishad&amp;f=false }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The concept of [[Karma]], with the idea of rebirth as the background, was effectively introduced into Indian thought by [[Yajnavalkya]] in the course of his discussion with Jāratkārva Ārtabhāga who wanted to know about what happens after death ([[Brihadaranyaka Upanishad]] III.ii.13), whether present actions matter in respect of the experience of the after-death state and how human efforts and ''karma'' are inter-related.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Psychology of Yoga|author=Georg Feurstein|publisher=Shambhala Publications|url= https://books.google.co.in/books?id=Y1eDAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT65&amp;dq=punya+upanishad&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=xrzNVKuFCIqF8gWP74CwCg&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=punya%20upanishad&amp;f=false }}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Vedic|Vedic people]] were multi-religious and believed in the existence of heaven and hell and in the transmigration of souls. For them the performance of ''[[yajna]]'' was important, and no ''yajna'' was complete or fruitful without ''[[dakshina]]'' i.e. the fee to the priests, and ''[[dāna]]'' i.e. charity, both deemed meritorious acts or ''punya-karma''; they accepted the philosophy of sin (''pāpa'') and merit (''punya''). &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Ancient History of India: Vedic Period|author=K.C.Singhal|publisher=Atlantic Publishers|page=|url= https://books.google.co.in/books?id=hoXqCmo-Xs8C&amp;pg=PA151&amp;dq=punya+vedas&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=_b7NVJP2N4zo8AX2vICYCg&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=punya%20vedas&amp;f=false }}&lt;/ref&gt;


''Punya'' is a very ancient Sanskrit word which appears in the [[Rig veda]]. For instance, in a prayer to Kapinjala Ivendro Devata, Rishi Gutsamada, while describing the qualities of an ''upadeshaka'' ('teacher') states:
:उद्गातेव शकुने सं गायसि ब्रह्मपुत्रइव सवनेषु शंससि |
:वृषेव वाजी शिशुमतीरपीत्या सर्वतो नः शकुने भद्रमावद विश्वतो नः शकुने पुण्यमावद || - ([[Rig Veda]] II.43.2)
in which ''[[mantra]]'' the word, ''punya'', is used to mean - 'good' or 'auspicious' or 'happy'. Many other Vedic texts, such as [[Chandogya Upanishad]] (VIII.ii.6) – पुण्यजितो लोकः (in which phrase ''aja'' refers to the Brahmaloka), have used it as meaning 'agreeable' or 'happy'. Otherwise, in [[Sanskrit literature]], this word is used to indicate 'advantageous', 'good', 'convenient', 'beneficent' or 'purifying'; [[Manusmṛti]] also uses it meaning the same; however, the opposite of ''punya'' is ''apunya'', which means that the word, ''punya'' cannot at all places be translated as 'merit' or 'meritorious', more so because the word ''pāpa'' is most often translated as 'sin'. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Religion, Philosophy, Yoga|author=Jean Filliozat|publisher=Motilal Banarsidass|page=234-240|url=https://books.google.co.in/books?id=2av2SuI8PpoC&amp;pg=PA233&amp;dq=punya+vedas&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=_b7NVJP2N4zo8AX2vICYCg&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=punya%20vedas&amp;f=false  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Adi Shankara]] exclaims:-

:पुण्यानि पापानि निरिन्द्रयस्य निश्चेतसो निर्विकृतेः निराकृतेः |
:कुतो ममाखण्डसुखानुभूतेः ब्रूते ह्यनन्वागत मित्यपि श्रुतिः ||

:"How can there be for me puṇya and pāpa who am without organs, without mind, without change and without form? How can these pertain to me who enjoy infinite bliss? The ananvāgataśruti also declares that these will not attend on me." — [[Vivekachudamani]] (St.504)

In his commentary on this stanza, [[Chandrasekhara Bharati III|Śri Candraśekhara Bhāratī of Śringeri]] explains that ''punya'' is the outcome of doing prescribed works, and ''pāpa'', the prohibited. All works pertaining to the body, to the mind and to speech are ''karma'', the good and bad with reference to actions make for ''punya'' and ''pāpa'' respectively; all actions and their outcome relate to the mind or to the body with form possessing sense-organs. The infinite bliss that Shankara speaks of is the ''sukha'' not generated by connection with sense-objects and therefore, in its experience there is no grief, no superimposition and no imagination whatsoever.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Sri Samkara’s Vivekacudamani|author=Sri Candrasekhara Bharati of Srngeri|publisher=Bharatiya Vidya Bhavan|place=Mumbai|page=128|url= http://www.worldcat.org/title/vivekacudamani-of-sri-samkara-bhagvatpata-with-an-english-translation-of-the-commentary-in-samskrt-by-jagadguru-sri-candrasekhara-bharati-svaminah-sri-samkaracarya-of-sarada-pitha-srngeri/oclc/633667305 }}&lt;/ref&gt; During the Vedic period speaking untruth was a sin, and false accusers were the real sinners; performance of ''[[yajna]]'' washed away all such sins, which means ritual acts were associated with morality. Untruth and impurity could be washed away by water or wiped away by Darbha grass. Along with the concept of [[Ṛta|Rta]] (righteousness) there was the more prominent concept of ''anrta'', the opposite of righteousness or untruth; terms for good and evil were developed and a wicked person was called ''pāpa'', where after from the term, ''sādhu'' denoting what was right, was the concept of ''punya'' developed. Yajnavalkya explains –

'''Reflective equilibrium''' is a state of [[Balance (metaphysics)|balance]] or coherence among a set of beliefs arrived at by a process of deliberative mutual adjustment among general principles and particular [[judgment]]s.  Although he did not use the term, philosopher [[Nelson Goodman]] introduced the method of reflective equilibrium as an approach to [[theory of justification|justifying]] the ''principles'' of [[inductive logic]].  The term 'reflective equilibrium' was coined by [[John Rawls]] and popularized in his ''[[A Theory of Justice]]'' as a method for arriving at the content of the principles of justice.

[[:de:Dietmar Hübner|Dietmar Hübner]] has pointed out that there are many interpretations of reflective equilibrium that deviate from Rawls' method in ways that reduce the cogency of the idea.&lt;ref name="Hübner"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Hübner |first=Dietmar |date=January 2017 |title=Three remarks on 'reflective equilibrium': on the use and misuse of Rawls' balancing concept in contemporary ethics |journal=[[Philosophical Inquiry]] |volume=41 |issue=1 |pages=11–40 |doi=10.5840/philinquiry20174112}}&lt;/ref&gt; Among these misinterpretations, according to Hübner, are definitions of reflective equilibrium as "(a) balancing theoretical accounts against intuitive convictions; (b) balancing general principles against particular judgements; (c) balancing opposite ethical conceptions or divergent moral statements".&lt;ref name="Hübner"/&gt;

==Overview==
Rawls argues that human beings have a "sense of [[justice]]" which is both a source of moral judgment and moral motivation.  In Rawls's theory, we begin with "considered judgments" that arise from the sense of justice.  These may be judgments about general moral principles (of any level of generality) or specific moral cases. If our judgments conflict in some way, we proceed by adjusting our various beliefs until they are in "equilibrium", which is to say that they are stable, not in conflict, and provide consistent practical guidance.  Rawls argues that a set of moral beliefs in ideal reflective equilibrium describes or characterizes the underlying principles of the human sense of justice.

An example of the method of reflective equilibrium may be useful.  Suppose Zachary believes in the general principle of always obeying the commands in the [[Bible]], and mistakenly thinks that these are completely encompassed by every Old Testament command.{{clarify|date=May 2015}}&lt;!--What is "encompassed" supposed to mean here? A member of a set obviously can't "encompass" the set, it's the other way round! If you mean something like "he mistakenly believes that every Old Testament command counts", then just say so, but first prove it is a mistaken belief, or better yet, change your example.--&gt;  Suppose also that he thinks that it is not ethical to [[stoning|stone]] people to death merely for being [[Wicca]]n.  These views may come into conflict (see Exodus 22:18, but see John 8:7).  If they do, Zachary will then have several choices.  He can discard his general principle in search of a better one (for example, only obeying the [[Ten Commandments]]), modify his general principle (for example, choosing a different translation of the Bible, or letting Jesus' teaching from John 8:7 "If any of you is without sin, let him be the first to cast a stone" override the Old Testament command), or change his opinions about the point in question to conform with his theory (by deciding that witches really should be killed).  Whatever the decision, he has moved toward reflective equilibrium.

==Use in Rawls's political theory==
Reflective equilibrium serves an important justificatory function within Rawls's political theory. The nature of this function, however, is disputed. The dominant view, best exemplified by the work of [[Norman Daniels]] and [[T. M. Scanlon|Thomas Scanlon]], is that the method of reflective equilibrium is a kind of [[coherentism|coherentist]] method for the epistemic justification of moral beliefs. However, in other writings, Rawls seems to argue that his theory bypasses traditional [[Meta-ethics|metaethical]] questions, including questions of moral epistemology, and is intended instead to serve a practical function. This provides some motivation for a different view of the justificatory role of reflective equilibrium. On this view, the method of reflective equilibrium serves its justificatory function by linking together the cognitive and motivational aspects of the human sense of justice in the appropriate way.

Rawls argues that candidate principles of justice cannot be justified unless they are shown to be stable. Principles of justice are stable if, among other things, the members of society regard them as authoritative and reliably compliant with them. The method of reflective equilibrium determines a set of principles rooted in the human sense of justice, which is a capacity that both provides the material for the process of reflective equilibration and our motivation to adhere to principles we judge morally sound. The method of reflective equilibrium serves the aim of defining a realistic and stable social order by determining a practically coherent set of principles that are grounded in the right way in the source of our moral motivation, such that we will be disposed to comply with them. As Fred D'Agostino puts it, stable principles of justice will require considerable "up-take" by the members of society. The method of reflective equilibrium provides a way of settling on principles that will achieve the kind of "up-take" necessary for stability.

Reflective equilibrium is not static, though Rawls allows for provisional fixed points; it will change as the individual considers his opinions about individual issues or explores the consequences of his principles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Rawls |first=John |authorlink=John Rawls |date=1971 |title=A theory of justice |location=Cambridge, MA |publisher=[[Belknap Press]] of [[Harvard University Press]] |isbn=0674880102 |oclc=216912 |page=65}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Rawls applied this technique to his conception of a hypothetical [[original position]] from which people would agree to a [[social contract]].  He arrived at the conclusion that the optimal theory of justice is the one to which people would agree from behind a [[veil of ignorance (philosophy)|veil of ignorance]], not knowing their social positions.

==Wide reflective equilibrium==
&lt;!--[[Wide reflective equilibrium]] redirects here ([[MOS:HEAD]])--&gt;
{{Expand section|date=October 2017}}
Wide reflective equilibrium, first introduced by Rawls, has been described by Norman Daniels as "a method that attempts to produce coherence in ordered triple sets of beliefs held by a particular person, namely: (a) a set of considered moral judgments, (b) a set of moral principles, and (c) a set of relevant (scientific and philosophical) background theories".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Räikkä |first=Juha |date=2011 |chapter=Wide reflective equilibrium |editor-last=Chatterjee |editor-first=Deen K. |title=Encyclopedia of global justice |series=Springer reference |location=Dordrecht |publisher=[[Springer Verlag]] |pages=1157–1158 |isbn=9781402091599 |oclc=772633396 |doi=10.1007/978-1-4020-9160-5_33 |ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Relation to constructivism==
{{See also|Constructivism (psychological school)|Constructivist epistemology}}
[[Kai Nielsen (philosopher)|Kai Nielsen]] has asserted that "philosophers who are defenders of reflective equilibrium are also ''[[Constructivism (psychological school)|constructivists]]''", in response to what he considered to be the misconception that reflective equilibrium works with some necessarily preexisting coherent system of moral beliefs and practices:&lt;ref name="Nielsen"&gt;{{cite book |last=Nielsen |first=Kai |authorlink=Kai Nielsen (philosopher) |date=1996 |chapter=Preface |title=Naturalism without foundations |series=Prometheus lectures |location=Amherst, NY |publisher=[[Prometheus Books]] |pages=9–22 |isbn=1573920762 |oclc=34798014}}&lt;/ref&gt; {{Quote|The pattern of consistent beliefs, including very centrally moral beliefs, is not a structure to be discovered or unearthed, as if it were analogous to the deep underlying "depth grammar" of language (if indeed there is any such a thing), but something to be ''forged''—constructed—by a careful and resolute use of the method of reflective equilibrium. We start from our considered judgments (convictions), however culturally and historically skewed. This involves—indeed, inescapably involves—seeing things by our own lights. Where else could we start? We can hardly jump out of our cultural and historical skins.&lt;ref name="Nielsen"/&gt;}}

==Criticism==
[[Paul Thagard]] has criticized the method of reflective equilibrium as "only like a smokescreen for a relatively sophisticated form of logical and methodological relativism" and "at best incidental to the process of developing normative principles".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Thagard |first=Paul |authorlink=Paul Thagard |date=1988 |title=Computational philosophy of science |location=Cambridge, MA |publisher=[[MIT Press]] |page=115 |isbn=0262200686 |oclc=16525738}}&lt;/ref&gt; Among the "numerous problems" of reflective equilibrium, Thagard counted "undue reliance on intuition and the danger of arriving at stable but suboptimal sets of norms".&lt;ref name="Thagard 2009"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Thagard |first=Paul |authorlink=Paul Thagard |date=April 2009 |title=Why cognitive science needs philosophy and vice versa |journal=Topics in Cognitive Science |volume=1 |issue=2 |pages=237–254 [248] |doi=10.1111/j.1756-8765.2009.01016.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; In place of reflective equilibrium, Thagard recommended what he considered to be a more [[consequentialist]] method of justifying norms by identifying a domain of practices, identifying candidate norms for the practices, identifying the appropriate goals of the practices, evaluating the extent to which different practices accomplish these goals, and adopting as domain norms the practices that best accomplish these goals.&lt;ref name="Thagard 2009"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Thagard |first=Paul |authorlink=Paul Thagard |date=2010 |title=The brain and the meaning of life |location=Princeton, NJ |publisher=[[Princeton University Press]] |pages=202–217 |isbn=9780691142722 |oclc=416717721}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[mathematics]] and [[abstract algebra]], a '''relation algebra''' is a [[residuated Boolean algebra]] [[reduct|expanded]] with an [[involution (mathematics)|involution]] called '''converse''', a unary operation. The motivating example of a relation algebra is the algebra 2&lt;sup&gt;''X''²&lt;/sup&gt; of all [[binary relation]]s on a set ''X'', that is, subsets of the [[cartesian square]] ''X''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, with ''R''•''S'' interpreted as the usual [[Composition of relations|composition of binary relations]] ''R'' and ''S'', and with the converse of ''R'' as the [[converse relation]].

Relation algebra emerged in the 19th-century work of [[Augustus De Morgan]] and [[Charles Sanders Peirce|Charles Peirce]], which culminated in the [[algebraic logic]] of [[Ernst Schröder]]. The equational form of relation algebra treated here was developed by [[Alfred Tarski]] and his students, starting in the 1940s. Tarski and Givant (1987) applied relation algebra to a variable-free treatment of [[axiomatic set theory]], with the implication that mathematics founded on set theory could itself be conducted without variables.

==Definition==
A '''relation algebra''' (''L'', ∧, ∨, &lt;sup&gt;&amp;minus;&lt;/sup&gt;, 0, 1, •, '''I''', ˘) is an algebraic structure equipped with the [[Introduction to Boolean algebra|Boolean operations]] of conjunction ''x''∧''y'', disjunction ''x''∨''y'', and negation ''x''&lt;sup&gt;&amp;minus;&lt;/sup&gt;, the Boolean constants 0 and 1, the relational operations of [[composition of relations|composition]] ''x''•''y'' and [[converse relation|converse]] ''x''˘, and the relational constant '''I''', such that these operations and constants satisfy certain equations constituting an axiomatization of a [[algebraic logic#Calculus of relations|calculus of relations]]. Roughly, a relation algebra is to a system of binary relations on a set containing the [[empty relation|empty]] (0), [[universal relation|complete]] (1), and [[identity relation|identity]] ('''I''') relations and closed under these five operations as a [[group (mathematics)|group]] is to a system of [[permutation]]s of a set containing the identity permutation and closed under composition and inverse. However, the [[first-order logic|first order]] [[theory (logic)|theory]] of relation algebras is not [[completeness (logic)|complete]] for such systems of binary relations.

Following Jónsson and Tsinakis (1993) it is convenient to define additional operations ''x''◁''y'' = ''x''•''y''˘, and, dually,  ''x''▷''y'' = ''x''˘•''y'' .  Jónsson and Tsinakis showed that '''I'''◁''x'' = ''x''▷'''I''', and that both were equal to ''x''˘.  Hence a relation algebra can equally well be defined as an algebraic structure (''L'', ∧, ∨, &lt;sup&gt;&amp;minus;&lt;/sup&gt;, 0, 1, •, '''I''', ◁, ▷).  The advantage of this [[signature (logic)|signature]] over the usual one is that a relation algebra can then be defined in full simply as a [[residuated Boolean algebra]] for which '''I'''◁''x'' is an involution, that is, '''I'''◁('''I'''◁''x'') = ''x'' .  The latter condition can be thought of as the relational counterpart of the equation 1/(1/''x'') = ''x'' for ordinary arithmetic [[multiplicative inverse|reciprocal]], and some authors use reciprocal as a synonym for converse.

Since residuated Boolean algebras are axiomatized with finitely many identities, so are relation algebras. Hence the latter form a [[Variety (universal algebra)|variety]], the variety '''RA''' of relation algebras.  Expanding the above definition as equations yields the following finite axiomatization.

===Axioms===
The axioms '''B1-B10''' below are adapted from Givant (2006: 283), and were first set out by [[alfred Tarski|Tarski]] in 1948.&lt;ref&gt;[[Alfred Tarski]] (1948) "Abstract: Representation Problems for Relation Algebras," ''Bulletin of the AMS'' 54: 80.&lt;/ref&gt;

''L'' is a [[Boolean algebra (structure)|Boolean algebra]] under binary [[disjunction]], ∨, and unary [[Complement (order theory)|complementation]] ()&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;:
:'''B1''': ''A'' ∨ ''B'' = ''B'' ∨ ''A''
:'''B2''': ''A'' ∨ (''B'' ∨ ''C'') = (''A'' ∨ ''B'') ∨ ''C''
:'''B3''': (''A''&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt; ∨ ''B'')&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt; ∨ (''A''&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt; ∨ ''B''&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;)&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt; = ''A''
This axiomatization of Boolean algebra is due to [[Edward Vermilye Huntington|Huntington]] (1933).  Note that the meet of the implied Boolean algebra is ''not'' the • operator (even though it distributes over &lt;math&gt;\vee&lt;/math&gt; like a meet does), nor is the 1 of the Boolean algebra the '''I''' constant.

''L'' is a [[monoid]] under binary [[composition of relations|composition]] (•) and [[nullary]] identity '''I''':
:'''B4''': ''A''•(''B''•''C'') = (''A''•''B'')•''C''
:'''B5''': ''A''•'''I''' = ''A''

Unary [[converse relation|converse]] ()˘ is an [[semigroup with involution|involution with respect to composition]]:
:'''B6''': ''A''˘˘ = ''A'' 
:'''B7''': (''A''•''B'')˘ = ''B''˘•''A''˘

Axiom B6 defines conversion as an [[involution (mathematics)|involution]], whereas B7 expresses the [[antidistributive]] property of conversion relative to composition.&lt;ref name="BrinkKahl1997"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Chris Brink|author2=Wolfram Kahl|author3=Gunther Schmidt|title=Relational Methods in Computer Science|date=1997|publisher=Springer|isbn=978-3-211-82971-4|pages=4 and 8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Converse and composition [[distributive law|distribute]] over disjunction:
:'''B8''': (''A''∨''B'')˘ = ''A''˘∨''B''˘
:'''B9''': (''A''∨''B'')•''C'' = (''A''•''C'')∨(''B''•''C'')

'''B10''' is Tarski's equational form of the fact, discovered by [[Augustus De Morgan]], that ''A''•''B'' &amp;le; ''C''&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;  {{eqv}} ''A''˘•''C'' &amp;le; ''B''&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;  {{eqv}} ''C''•''B''˘ &amp;le; ''A''&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;.
:'''B10''': (''A''˘•(''A''•''B'')&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;)∨''B''&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt; = ''B''&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;

These axioms are [[ZFC]] theorems; for the purely Boolean '''B1-B3''', this fact is trivial. After each of the following axioms is shown the number of the corresponding theorem in Chapter 3 of Suppes (1960), an exposition of ZFC: '''B4''' 27, '''B5''' 45, '''B6''' 14, '''B7''' 26, '''B8''' 16, '''B9''' 23.

==Expressing properties of binary relations in RA==
The following table shows how many of the usual properties of [[binary relation]]s can be expressed as succinct '''RA''' equalities or inequalities. Below, an inequality of the form ''A''≤''B'' is shorthand for the Boolean equation ''A''∨''B'' = ''B''.

The most complete set of results of this nature is Chapter C of Carnap (1958), where the notation is rather distant from that of this entry. Chapter  3.2 of Suppes (1960) contains fewer results, presented as [[ZFC]] theorems and using a notation that more resembles that of this entry. Neither Carnap nor Suppes formulated their results using the '''RA''' of this entry, or in an equational manner.

==Expressive power==
The [[metamathematics]] of '''RA''' are discussed at length in Tarski and Givant (1987), and more briefly in Givant (2006).

'''RA''' consists entirely of equations manipulated using nothing more than uniform replacement and the substitution of equals for equals. Both rules are wholly familiar from school mathematics and from [[abstract algebra]] generally. Hence '''RA''' proofs are carried out in a manner familiar to all mathematicians, unlike the case in [[mathematical logic]] generally.

'''RA''' can express any (and up to [[logical equivalence]], exactly the) [[first-order logic]] (FOL) formulas containing no more than three variables. (A given variable can be quantified multiple times and hence quantifiers can be nested arbitrarily deeply by "reusing" variables.) Surprisingly, this fragment of FOL suffices to express [[Peano arithmetic]] and almost all [[axiomatic set theory|axiomatic set theories]] ever proposed. Hence '''RA''' is, in effect, a way of algebraizing nearly all mathematics, while dispensing with FOL and its [[Logical connective|connectives]], [[Quantifier (logic)|quantifier]]s, [[turnstile (symbol)|turnstiles]], and [[modus ponens]]. Because '''RA''' can express Peano arithmetic and set theory, [[Gödel's incompleteness theorems]] apply to it; '''RA''' is [[Gödel's incompleteness theorems|incomplete]], incompletable, and [[undecidable problem|undecidable]].{{Citation needed|date=April 2012}} (N.B. The Boolean algebra fragment of '''RA''' is complete and decidable.)

The '''representable relation algebras''', forming the class '''RRA''', are those relation algebras isomorphic to some relation algebra consisting of binary relations on some set, and closed under the intended interpretation of the '''RA''' operations. It is easily shown, e.g. using the method of [[pseudoelementary class]]es, that '''RRA''' is a [[quasivariety]], that is, axiomatizable by a [[universal Horn theory]]. In 1950, [[Roger Lyndon]] proved the existence of equations holding in '''RRA''' that did not hold in '''RA'''. Hence the variety generated by '''RRA''' is a proper subvariety of the variety '''RA'''. In 1955, [[Alfred Tarski]] showed that '''RRA''' is itself a variety. In 1964, Donald Monk showed that '''RRA''' has no finite axiomatization, unlike '''RA''', which is finitely axiomatized by definition.

===Q-relation algebras===
An '''RA''' is a Q-relation algebra ('''QRA''') if, in addition to '''B1-B10''', there exist some ''A'' and ''B'' such that (Tarski and Givant 1987: §8.4):

:'''Q0''': ''A''˘•''A'' ≤ '''I'''
:'''Q1''': ''B''˘•''B'' ≤ '''I'''
:'''Q2''': ''A''˘•''B'' = 1

Essentially these axioms imply that the universe has a (non-surjective) pairing relation whose projections are ''A'' and ''B''. It is a theorem that every '''QRA''' is a '''RRA''' (Proof by Maddux, see Tarski &amp; Givant 1987: 8.4(iii) ).

Every '''QRA''' is representable (Tarski and Givant 1987). That not every relation algebra is representable is a fundamental way '''RA''' differs from '''QRA''' and [[Boolean algebra (structure)|Boolean algebras]], which, by [[Stone's representation theorem for Boolean algebras]], are always representable as sets of subsets of some set, closed under union, intersection, and complement.

== Examples ==
1.  Any Boolean algebra can be turned into a '''RA''' by interpreting conjunction as composition (the monoid multiplication •), i.e. ''x''•''y'' is defined as ''x''∧''y''.  This interpretation requires that converse interpret identity (''ў'' = ''y''), and that both residuals ''y''\''x'' and ''x''/''y'' interpret the conditional ''y''→''x''  (i.e., ¬''y''∨''x'').

2.  The motivating example of a relation algebra depends on the definition of a binary relation ''R'' on a set ''X'' as any subset ''R'' ⊆ ''X''², where  ''X''² is the [[Cartesian square]] of ''X''. The power set 2&lt;sup&gt;''X''²&lt;/sup&gt; consisting of all binary relations on ''X'' is a Boolean algebra. While  2&lt;sup&gt;''X''²&lt;/sup&gt; can be made a relation algebra by taking ''R''•''S'' = ''R''∧''S'', as per example (1) above, the standard interpretation of • is instead ''x''(''R''•''S'')''z'' = ∃''y'':''xRy.ySz''.  That is, the [[ordered pair]] (''x'',''z'') belongs to the relation ''R''•''S'' just when there exists ''y'' ∈ ''X'' such that (''x'',''y'') ∈ ''R'' and (''y'',''z'') ∈ ''S''. This interpretation uniquely determines ''R''\''S'' as consisting of all pairs (''y'',''z'') such that for all ''x'' ∈ ''X'', if ''xRy'' then ''xSz''. Dually, ''S''/''R'' consists of all pairs (''x'',''y'') such that for all ''z'' ∈ ''X'', if ''yRz'' then ''xSz''. The translation ''ў'' = ¬(y\¬'''I''') then establishes the converse ''R''˘ of ''R'' as consisting of all pairs (''y'',''x'') such that (''x'',''y'') ∈ ''R''.

3.  An important generalization of the previous example is the power set 2&lt;sup&gt;''E''&lt;/sup&gt; where ''E'' ⊆ ''X''² is any [[equivalence relation]] on the set ''X''. This is a generalization because ''X''² is itself an equivalence relation, namely the complete relation consisting of all pairs. While 2&lt;sup&gt;''E''&lt;/sup&gt; is not a subalgebra of 2&lt;sup&gt;''X''²&lt;/sup&gt; when ''E'' ≠ ''X''² (since in that case it does not contain the relation ''X''², the top element 1 being ''E'' instead of ''X''²), it is nevertheless turned into a relation algebra using the same definitions of the operations. Its importance resides in the definition of a ''representable relation algebra'' as any relation algebra isomorphic to a subalgebra of the relation algebra 2&lt;sup&gt;''E''&lt;/sup&gt; for some equivalence relation ''E'' on some set. The previous section says more about the relevant metamathematics.

4. Let &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; be group. Then the power set &lt;math&gt;2^G&lt;/math&gt; is a relation algebra with the obvious boolean algebra operations, composition given by the [[product of group subsets]], the converse by the inverse subset (&lt;math&gt;A^{-1} = \{a^{-1}\mid a\in A\}&lt;/math&gt;), and the identity by the singleton subset &lt;math&gt;\{e\}&lt;/math&gt;. There is a relation algebra homomorphism embedding &lt;math&gt;2^G&lt;/math&gt; in &lt;math&gt;2^{G\times G}&lt;/math&gt; which sends each subset &lt;math&gt;A\subset G&lt;/math&gt; to the relation
&lt;math&gt;R_A = \{(g, h)\in G \times G\mid h\in A g\}&lt;/math&gt;. The image of this homomorphism is the set of all right-invariant relations on &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt;. 

5. If group sum or product interprets composition, [[Group_(mathematics)#Definition|group inverse]] interprets converse, group identity interprets '''I''', and if ''R'' is a [[one-to-one correspondence]], so that ''R''˘•''R'' = ''R•R''˘ = '''I''',&lt;ref&gt;[[Alfred Tarski|Tarski, A.]] (1941), p. 87.&lt;/ref&gt; then ''L'' is a [[group (mathematics)|group]] as well as a [[monoid]]. '''B4'''-'''B7''' become well-known theorems of [[group theory]], so that '''RA''' becomes a [[proper extension]] of [[group theory]] as well as of Boolean algebra.

==Historical remarks==
[[augustus De Morgan|De Morgan]] founded '''RA''' in 1860, but [[Charles Sanders Peirce|C. S. Peirce]] took it much further and became fascinated with its philosophical power. The work of DeMorgan and Peirce came to be known mainly in the extended and definitive form [[Ernst Schröder]] gave it in Vol. 3 of his ''Vorlesungen'' (1890–1905). ''[[Principia Mathematica]]'' drew strongly on Schröder's '''RA''', but acknowledged him only as the inventor of the notation. In 1912, [[Alwin Korselt]] proved that a particular formula in which the quantifiers were nested four deep had no '''RA''' equivalent.&lt;ref&gt;Korselt did not publish his finding. It was first published in [[Leopold Loewenheim]] (1915) "Über Möglichkeiten im Relativkalkül," ''[[Mathematische Annalen]]'' 76: 447–470. Translated as "On possibilities in the calculus of relatives" in [[Jean van Heijenoort]], 1967. ''A Source Book in Mathematical Logic, 1879–1931''. Harvard Univ. Press: 228–251.&lt;/ref&gt; This fact led to a loss of interest in '''RA''' until Tarski (1941) began writing about it. His students have continued to develop '''RA''' down to the present day. Tarski returned to '''RA''' in the 1970s with the help of Steven Givant; this collaboration resulted in the monograph by Tarski and Givant (1987), the definitive reference for this subject. For more on the history of '''RA''', see Maddux (1991, 2006).

'''''Sega Enterprises Ltd. v. Accolade, Inc.''''', 977 F.2d 1510 (9th Cir. 1992), is a [[Legal case|case]] in which the [[United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit]] applied American [[intellectual property]] law to the [[reverse engineering]] of [[computer software]].  Stemming from the publishing of several [[Sega Genesis]] [[video games|games]] by video game publisher [[Accolade (company)|Accolade]], which had disassembled Genesis software in order to publish games without being licensed by [[Sega]], the case involved several overlapping issues, including the scope of [[copyright]], permissible uses for [[trademark]]s, and the scope of the [[fair use]] doctrine for computer code.&lt;ref name="sail_book"&gt;{{cite book |last=Lemley |first=Mark A.|title=Software and Internet Law |edition=3rd |year=2006 |publisher=Aspen Law &amp; Business|isbn=0-7355-1312-0 |pages=126–141, 248–254|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The case was filed in the [[United States District Court for the Northern District of California|U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California]], which ruled in favor of Sega and issued an injunction against Accolade preventing them from publishing any more games for the Genesis and requiring them to recall all the existing Genesis games they had for sale.  Accolade appealed the decision to the Ninth Circuit on the grounds that their reverse engineering of the Genesis was protected under fair use.  The Ninth Circuit reversed the district court's order and ruled that Accolade's use of reverse engineering to publish Genesis titles was protected under fair use, and that its alleged violation of Sega trademarks was the fault of Sega.  The case is frequently cited in matters involving reverse engineering and fair use under copyright law.

==Background==
In March 1984, [[Sega|Sega Enterprises Ltd.]] was purchased by its former [[chief executive officer|CEO]], [[David Rosen (business)|David Rosen]], along with a group of backers.  [[Hayao Nakayama]], one of these backers, was named the new CEO of Sega.  Following the crash of the arcade industry, Nakayama decided to focus development efforts on the [[Video game console|home console]] market.&lt;ref name="Ultimate History of Video Games"/&gt;{{rp|344}}  During this time, Sega became concerned about [[Copyright infringement|software and hardware piracy]] in [[Southeast Asia]], and particularly in [[Taiwan]]. Taiwan was not a signatory of the [[Berne Convention for the Protection of Literary and Artistic Works|Berne Convention]] on copyright, limiting Sega's legal options in that region.  However, Taiwan did allow prosecution for [[trademark infringement]].&lt;ref name="977 F.2d 1510: opinion"/&gt;  Though Sega had created security systems in their consoles to keep their software from being pirated and to keep unlicensed publishers out, much like its competitor [[Nintendo]],&lt;ref name="Ultimate History of Video Games"/&gt;{{rp|382}} counterfeiters had discovered ways to prevent the Sega trademark from appearing on their games, bypassing the trademark altogether.&lt;ref name="977 F.2d 1510: opinion"/&gt;

[[File:Sega-Genesis-Mod1-Bare.jpg|thumb|left|alt=A photo of a model 1 Sega Genesis console|An edition of the original model of Genesis, known as the Genesis III, was the model at the center of ''Sega v. Accolade'' for its incorporation of the Trademark Security System (TMSS)]]

After the release of the Sega Genesis in 1989, video game publisher Accolade began exploring options to release some of their [[PC game]] titles onto the console.  At the time, however, Sega had a licensing deal in place for [[Video game developers#Third-party developers|third-party developers]] that increased the costs to the developer.  According to Accolade co-founder [[Alan Miller (game designer)|Alan Miller]], "One pays them between $10 and $15 per cartridge on top of the real hardware manufacturing costs, so it about doubles the cost of goods to the independent publisher."&lt;ref name="Ultimate History of Video Games"/&gt;{{rp|381}}  In addition to this, Sega required that it would be the exclusive publisher of Accolade's games if Accolade were to be licensed, preventing Accolade from releasing its games to other systems.&lt;ref name="977 F.2d 1510: opinion"/&gt;&lt;ref name="legal_book"&gt;{{cite book |last=Graham |first=Lawrence D. |title=Legal Battles That Shaped the Computer Industry |year=1999 |publisher=Greenwood Publishing Group|isbn=1-56720-178-4 |pages=112–118}}&lt;/ref&gt;  To get around licensing, Accolade chose to seek an alternative way to bring their games to the Genesis by purchasing a console in order to decompile the [[executable]] code of three Genesis games and use it to program their new cartridges in a way that would allow them to disable the security lockouts that prevented playing of unlicensed games.&lt;ref name="977 F.2d 1510: opinion"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Ultimate History of Video Games"/&gt;{{rp|383}} This was done successfully to bring ''[[Ishido: The Way of Stones]]'' to the Genesis in 1990.&lt;ref name="Ultimate History of Video Games"/&gt;{{rp|382}}  In doing so, Accolade had also copied Sega's copyrighted game code multiple times in order to reverse engineer the software of Sega's licensed Genesis games.&lt;ref name="legal_book" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Georgetown"&gt;{{cite journal | author = Cohen, Julie E. | authorlink = Julie E.

[[File:Sega-TMSS-Trademark-Security-System-screenshot.png|thumb|right|alt=A screenshot of the message "PRODUCED BY OR UNDER LICENSE FROM SEGA ENTERPRISES LTD."|The screen displayed by the Trademark Security System (TMSS)]]

As a result of the piracy and unlicensed development issues, Sega incorporated a technical protection mechanism into a new edition of the Genesis released in 1990, referred to as the '''Genesis III'''.  This new variation of the Genesis included code known as the Trademark Security System (TMSS), which, when a game cartridge was inserted into the console, would check for the presence of the [[String (computer science)|string]] "SEGA" at a particular point in the memory contained in the cartridge.&lt;ref name="Reverse Engineering: An Industrial Perspective"/&gt; If and only if the string was present, the console would run the game, and would briefly display the message: "PRODUCED BY OR UNDER LICENSE FROM SEGA ENTERPRISES LTD."&lt;ref name="977 F.2d 1510: opinion"/&gt;  This system had a twofold effect: it added extra protection against unlicensed developers and software piracy, and it forced the Sega trademark to display when the game was powered up, making a lawsuit for trademark infringement possible if unlicensed software were to be developed.&lt;ref name="Ultimate History of Video Games"/&gt;{{rp|383}}&lt;ref name="Georgetown" /&gt;  Accolade learned of this development at the [[International CES|Winter Consumer Electronics Show]] in January 1991, at which Sega showed the new Genesis III and demonstrated it screening and rejecting an ''Ishido'' game cartridge.&lt;ref name="Ultimate History of Video Games"/&gt;{{rp|383}}  With more games planned for the following year,  Accolade successfully identified the TMSS file.  They later added this file to the games ''[[HardBall!]]'', ''[[Star Control]]'', ''Mike Ditka Power Football'', and ''[[Turrican]]''.&lt;ref name="Ultimate History of Video Games"/&gt;{{rp|383}}

==Lawsuit==
On October 31, 1991, Sega filed suit against Accolade in the United States District Court for the Northern District of California, on charges of trademark infringement and [[unfair competition]] in violation of the [[Lanham Act]].  Copyright infringement, a violation of the [[Copyright Act of 1976]], was added a month later to the list of charges.  In response, Accolade filed a counterclaim for falsifying the source of its games by displaying the Sega trademark when the game was powered up.  The case was heard by Judge [[Barbara A. Caulfield]].&lt;ref name="977 F.2d 1510: opinion"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Ultimate History of Video Games"/&gt;{{rp|384}}&lt;ref name="legal_book" /&gt;

Sega argued that Accolade had infringed upon its copyrights because Accolade's games contained Sega's material.  Accolade insisted that their use of Sega's material constituted fair use.  However, Judge Caulfield did not accept this explanation since Accolade was a game manufacturer, their works were for financial gain, and because their works competed directly with Sega's licensed games, likely resulting in a sales decrease for Sega's games.&lt;ref name="Ultimate History of Video Games"/&gt;{{rp|384}}&lt;ref name="lmu"&gt;{{cite journal | author = MacCullouch, David C. | title = Sega Enterprises LTD. vs Accolade, Inc.: What's so Fair about Reverse Engineering? | journal = Loyola of Los Angeles Law Journal | volume = 14 | pages = 465–485 | year = 1994 | url = http://digitalcommons.lmu.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1284&amp;context=elr | deadurl = no | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20140903050530/http://digitalcommons.lmu.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1284&amp;context=elr | archivedate = 2014-09-03 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Accolade's case was further hurt by a presentation by a Sega engineer named Takeshi Nagashima, who showed two Sega game cartridges that were able to run on the Genesis III without the trademark-displaying TMSS, and offered them to Accolade's defense team but would not reveal how that was possible.&lt;ref name="977 F.2d 1510: opinion"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Ultimate History of Video Games"/&gt;{{rp|385}}  Ultimately, this would result in Accolade's defeat on April 3, 1992, when Judge Caulfield ruled in favor of Sega and issued an injunction prohibiting future sales by Accolade of Genesis-compatible games incorporating the Sega message or using the results of the reverse engineering.  Almost a week later, Accolade was also required by the court to recall all of their Genesis-compatible games.&lt;ref name="977 F.2d 1510: opinion"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Ultimate History of Video Games"/&gt;{{rp|386}}

==Appeal==

The decision in the district court ruling had been very costly to Accolade.  According to Accolade co-founder Alan Miller, "Just to fight the injunction, we had to pay at least half a million dollars in legal fees."&lt;ref name="Ultimate History of Video Games"/&gt;{{rp|386}}  On April 14, 1992, Accolade filed for a stay on the injunction pending appeal in the district court, but when the court did not rule by April 21, Accolade appealed the verdict to the Ninth Circuit of the U.S. Court of Appeals. A stay was granted on the mandate to recall all of Accolade's Genesis games, but the injunction preventing further reverse engineering and development of Genesis software was maintained until August 28, when the Ninth Circuit ordered it dissolved pending the appeal review.&lt;ref name="977 F.2d 1510: opinion"/&gt;

In support of the appeal, the [[Computer &amp; Communications Industry Association]] submitted an ''[[amicus curiae]]'' brief claiming that the district court had made errors in concluding that Accolade had infringed upon Sega's copyright by reverse engineering its software, extending [[copyright]] protection to [[Modus operandi|method of operation]], and failing to consider whether Accolade's games were substantially similar to Sega's copyrighted material.&lt;ref name="appeal"&gt;{{cite journal|author=Chapman, John H.|title=Brief Amicus Curiae of Computer &amp; Communications Industry Association|url=https://www.ccianet.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/Sega-Enterprises-Ltd.-v.-Accolade-Inc..pdf|accessdate=28 November 2014|publisher=[[Computer &amp; Communications Industry Association|CCIA]]|year=1992|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141204231757/https://www.ccianet.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/Sega-Enterprises-Ltd.-v.-Accolade-Inc..pdf|archivedate=4 December 2014|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Amicus briefs were also submitted by the American Committee for Interoperable Systems, the [[Computer and Business Equipment Manufacturers Association]], and copyright law professor [[Dennis S. Karjala]] from [[Arizona State University]].&lt;ref name="977 F.2d 1510: opinion"/&gt;

In reviewing the case, the court considered several factors in its own analysis, examining trademark and copyright issues separately. As in the district court trial, Nagashima showed the court a game cartridge that ran on the Genesis that did not display the trademark logo. However, the court was not moved by this, deciding that Nagashima's cartridges showed what one could do with knowledge of the TMSS, which Accolade did not possess.&lt;ref name="Ultimate History of Video Games"/&gt;{{rp|387}} According to the court, because knowledge of how to avoid displaying the trademark on the Genesis III was not information that was public to the industry, Sega's attempt to prove that the display of their trademark was not required for games to be played on the console was insufficient. Writing for the opinion of the court, Judge [[Stephen Reinhardt]] stated, "Sega knowingly risked two significant consequences: the false labeling of some competitors' products and the discouraging of other competitors from manufacturing Genesis-compatible games. Under the Lanham Act, the former conduct, at least, is clearly unlawful."&lt;ref name="977 F.2d 1510: opinion"/&gt; The court then went on to cite ''[[History of the board game Monopoly#Anti-Monopoly, Inc. vs. General Mills Fun Group, Inc. court case 1976–1985|Anti-Monopoly v. General Mills Fun Group]]'', which states in reference to the Lanham Act, "The trademark is misused if it serves to limit competition in the manufacture and sales of a product. That is the special province of the limited monopolies provided pursuant to the patent laws."&lt;ref name="611 F.2d 296"&gt;{{cite court | url=http://openjurist.org/611/f2d/296/anti-monopoly-inc-v-general-mills-fun-group| deadurl=no | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131029171510/http://openjurist.org/611/f2d/296/anti-monopoly-inc-v-general-mills-fun-group|archivedate=2013-10-29 | litigants=Anti-Monopoly, Inc., v. General Mills Fun Group, et al | court=611 F.2d 296 (9th Cir. 1979)}}&lt;/ref&gt; The judges in the case had decided that Sega had violated this provision of the act by utilizing its trademark to limit competition for software for its console.&lt;ref name="977 F.2d 1510: opinion"/&gt;

To determine the status of Accolade's claim of fair use of Sega's copyrighted game code, the court reviewed four criteria of fair use: the nature of the copyrighted work, the amount of the copyrighted work used, the purpose of use, and the effects of use on the market for the work.&lt;ref name="Reverse Engineering: An Industrial Perspective" /&gt; Of note to the judges in reviewing Sega's copyright claim was the difference in size between the TMSS file and the sizes of Accolade's games. As noted by Judge Reinhardt in writing the opinion of the court, the TMSS file "contains approximately twenty to twenty-five bytes of data. Each of Accolade's games contains a total of 500,000 to 1,500,000 [[byte]]s. According to Accolade employees, the header file is the only portion of Sega's code that Accolade copied into its own game programs."&lt;ref name="977 F.2d 1510: opinion"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Intellectual Property and Open Source" /&gt; This made the games overwhelmingly original content, and according to Judge Reinhardt, to the benefit of the public to be able to compete with Sega's licensed games, especially if the games were dissimilar as contended in the appeal.&lt;ref name="977 F.2d 1510: opinion"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Ultimate History of Video Games"/&gt;{{rp|387}}&lt;ref name="appeal" /&gt; The court did not accept the argument that Accolade's games competed directly with Sega's, noting that there was no proof that any of Accolade's published games had diminished the market for any of Sega's games. Despite claims from Sega's attorneys that the company had invested much time and effort into developing the Genesis, and that Accolade was capitalizing on this time and energy, the court rejected these claims under the notion that the console was largely functional, and its functional principles were not protected under the Copyright Act of 1976. On the matter of reverse engineering as a process, the court concluded that "where disassembly is the only way to gain access to the ideas and functional elements embodied in a copyrighted computer program and where there is a legitimate reason for seeking such access, disassembly is a fair use of the copyrighted work, as a matter of law."&lt;ref name="977 F.2d 1510: opinion"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Reverse Engineering: An Industrial Perspective" /&gt;

On August 28, 1992, the Ninth Circuit overturned the district court's verdict and ruled that Accolade's decompilation of the Sega software constituted fair use.&lt;ref name="ap"&gt;{{cite news |title=Court: Copying Sega's Code Ok an Appeals Court Ruling Protects The Practice of 'Reverse Engineering.' |url=http://infoweb.newsbank.com/iw-search/we/InfoWeb?p_action=doc&amp;p_topdoc=1&amp;p_docnum=1&amp;p_sort=YMD_date:D&amp;p_product=AWNB&amp;p_text_direct-0=document_id=(%200EB71A0198F20902%20)&amp;p_docid=0EB71A0198F20902&amp;p_theme=aggdocs&amp;p_queryname=0EB71A0198F20902&amp;f_openurl=yes&amp;p_nbid=M55Q47NAMTM3MTc3NTQ4MC4yODE4NzoxOjE0OnJmLW1vcmVuZXQ2OTI2&amp;&amp;p_multi=SJMB |newspaper=San Jose Mercury News {{subscription required|via=[[NewsBank]]}}|date=1992-09-01 |agency=Associated Press }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The court's written opinion followed on October 20 and noted that the use of the software was non-exploitative, despite being commercial,&lt;ref name="977 F.2d 1510: opinion"/&gt;&lt;ref name="book"&gt;{{cite book |ref=CITEREFKent2001 |last=Stuckey |first=Kent D. |title=Internet and Online Law |year=1996 |publisher=Law Journal Press |isbn=1-58852-074-9 |pages=6.37}}&lt;/ref&gt; and that the trademark infringement, being required by the TMSS for a Genesis game to run on the system, was inadvertently triggered by a fair use act and the fault of Sega for causing false labeling.&lt;ref name="977 F.2d 1510: opinion"/&gt;&lt;ref name="copyright" /&gt; As a result of the verdict being overturned, the costs of the appeal were assessed to Sega.

==Settlement==
On January 8, 1993, with Sega's petition for a rehearing still pending, the court took the unusual step of amending its October 20, 1992 opinion and lifted the injunction preventing Accolade from developing or selling Genesis software.&lt;ref name=mercury /&gt;  This was followed by a formal denial of Sega's petition for a rehearing on January 26.&lt;ref name="mercury2"&gt;{{cite news |title=Accolade Can Continue Making Genesis Games |url=http://infoweb.newsbank.com/iw-search/we/InfoWeb?p_action=doc&amp;p_topdoc=1&amp;p_docnum=1&amp;p_sort=YMD_date:D&amp;p_product=AWNB&amp;p_text_direct-0=document_id=(%200EB71A959E1FA17A%20)&amp;p_docid=0EB71A959E1FA17A&amp;p_theme=aggdocs&amp;p_queryname=0EB71A959E1FA17A&amp;f_openurl=yes&amp;p_nbid=B64X56DPMTM3MTc3NDgyNy4yNjAwNzY6MToxNDpyZi1tb3JlbmV0NjkyNg&amp;&amp;p_multi=SJMB |newspaper=San Jose Mercury News {{subscription required|via=[[NewsBank]]}}|date=1993-01-26 |accessdate=2013-06-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; As Accolade's counterclaim for false labeling under the Lanham Act was declined by the Ninth Circuit, this essentially left "each party as free to act as it was before the issuance of preliminary injunctive relief" while the district court considered the counterclaim.&lt;ref name="977 F.2d 1510: opinion"/&gt; Sega and Accolade ultimately settled on April 30, 1993.  As a part of this settlement, Accolade became an official licensee of Sega, and later developed and released ''[[Barkley Shut Up and Jam!]]'' while under license.&lt;ref name="Ultimate History of Video Games"/&gt;{{rp|388}}  The terms of the licensing, including whether or not any special arrangements or discounts were made to Accolade, were not released to the public.&lt;ref name="1up"&gt;{{cite web|author=Cifaldi, Frank |title=This Day in History: Sega and Accolade Settle Their Differences |publisher=[[1UP.com]] |url=http://www.1up.com/news/day-history-sega-accolade-settle |date=2010-04-30 |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20130615195031/http://www.1up.com/news/day-history-sega-accolade-settle |archivedate=June 15, 2013 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The financial terms of the settlement were also not disclosed, although both companies agreed to pay their own legal costs.&lt;ref name="Langberg"&gt;{{cite news |title=Accolade, Sega Settle 'Reverse Engineering' Case Out of Court |author=Langberg, Mike |url=http://infoweb.newsbank.com/iw-search/we/InfoWeb?p_action=doc&amp;p_topdoc=1&amp;p_docnum=1&amp;p_sort=YMD_date:D&amp;p_product=AWNB&amp;p_text_direct-0=document_id=(%200EB71B1470480CCB%20)&amp;p_docid=0EB71B1470480CCB&amp;p_theme=aggdocs&amp;p_queryname=0EB71B1470480CCB&amp;f_openurl=yes&amp;p_nbid=M5FL51HKMTM3MTc3NDkwOC44MjUyMDk6MToxNDpyZi1tb3JlbmV0NjkyNg&amp;&amp;p_multi=SJMB |newspaper=San Jose Mercury News {{subscription required|via=[[NewsBank]]}}|date=1993-05-01 |accessdate=2013-06-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In an official statement, Sega of America chairman David Rosen expressed satisfaction with the settlement.  According to Rosen, "This settlement is a satisfactory ending to what was a very complex set of issues. Not only are we pleased to settle this case amicably, we've also turned a corner in our association with Accolade and now look forward to a healthy and mutually beneficial relationship in the future."  Accolade's Alan Miller expressed more excitement with the settlement and the opportunities it presented for the company, saying in his statement, "We are very pleased with the settlement, and we're excited about the new markets it opens to Accolade. Accolade currently experiences strong demand for its Sega Genesis products in North America and Europe. We will now be able to publish our products on the Sega Genesis and [[Game Gear]] systems throughout the world."&lt;ref name="1up" /&gt;  Despite the settlement, however, Accolade had lost somewhere between $15 million and $25 million during the injunction period, according to Miller.&lt;ref name="Ultimate History of Video Games"/&gt;{{rp|386}}

==Impact==
[[File:SEGA logo.svg|thumb|right|Sega's logo]]

''Sega v. Accolade'' has been an influential case in matters involving reverse engineering of software and copyright infringement, and has been cited in numerous cases since 1993.&lt;ref name="Ultimate History of Video Games"/&gt;{{rp|388}}&lt;ref name="Intellectual Property and Open Source"/&gt;  The case has redefined how reverse engineering with unlicensed products is seen in legal issues involving copyright.  Legally, the decision concurred that the nature of Accolade's work in reverse engineering the Sega Genesis was to access ideas that were deemed unprotected by copyright law, and could only be accessed by decompiling.&lt;ref name="book" /&gt;  By the verdict, the console's functional principles were established not to be protected by copyright,&lt;ref name="Georgetown" /&gt; and that when no other means were available, reverse engineering the copyrighted software to access information about the console's functional principles is protected by the fair use doctrine.&lt;ref name="copyright"&gt;{{cite journal | author = Ely, Wayne A. | title = Copyright and Trademark Protection of Computer Software - Reverse Engineering of Competitor's Computer Game Software, Required to Comprehend Work, and Resulting in Display of False Trademark, Not Violative of Copyright Act or Lanham Act - Sega Enterprises, Ltd. v.

Jan. 6, 1993) | journal = Temple Environmental Law and Technology Journal | volume = 31| issue = 4 | page = 137 | year = 1993}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="aguilar"&gt;{{cite journal | author = Aguilar, Julie | title = Intellectual Property - Sega Enterprises Ltd. v.

Connectix Corporation]]'', which cited ''Sega v. Accolade'' in deciding that reverse engineering the [[PlayStation (console)|Sony PlayStation]] [[BIOS]] was protected by fair use and was non-exploitative.&lt;ref name="book" /&gt;

Among the influences of the verdict include ''Sega v. Accolade'''s effect on the criteria for fair use and the responsibilities of trademark holders in legal examinations.  Although Accolade had copied entire Genesis games in order to identify the TMSS, the court gave little weight to the criterion on the amount of the copyrighted work being copied, in light of the fact that Accolade had done so in order to create their own compatible software.  Likewise, the nature of the work was also given less weight, essentially establishing a two-factor approach to evaluating fair use in the purpose of use and impact on the market.&lt;ref name="2factor"&gt;{{cite journal | author = Liu, Joseph P. | title = Two-Factor Fair Use? | journal = Columbia Journal of Law &amp; the Arts | volume = 12 | pages = 571–585 | year = 2008 | url = http://works.bepress.com/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1060&amp;context=joseph_liu | deadurl = no | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20131221083921/http://works.bepress.com/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1060&amp;context=joseph_liu | archivedate = 2013-12-21 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;  It was also the first time that the Lanham Act was interpreted to mean that confusion resulting from the placement of one's trademark on another work by means of a security program is the fault of the original registrant of the trademark.&lt;ref name="copyright" /&gt;

''Sega v. Accolade'' also served to help establish that the functional principles of computer software cannot be protected by copyright law.  Rather, the only legal protection to such principles can be through holding a [[patent]] or by trade secret.&lt;ref name="bitandpendulum"&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Stefik, Mark |author2=Alex Silverman |lastauthoramp=yes |title=The Bit and the Pendulum: Balancing the Interests of Stakeholders in Digital Publishing |publisher=[[Xerox]] Palo Alto Research Center |year=1997 |url=http://www.markstefik.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/1997-Bit-and-Pendulum-Stefik-Silverman.pdf |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160112204252/http://www.markstefik.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/1997-Bit-and-Pendulum-Stefik-Silverman.pdf |archivedate=2016-01-12 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  This aspect of the verdict has received criticism as well, citing that though the functional principles are not protectable under copyright law, the TMSS code is protectable, and that by allowing reverse engineering as fair use despite this security, the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals has encouraged the copying of legally protected programs for the exploration of unprotected functionality.&lt;ref name="lmu" /&gt;

The word ''Self-consciousness'' in the [[Upanishad]]s means the knowledge about the existence and nature of [[Brahman]].

==Metaphysics==
Metaphysicians regard the Self either to be distinct from the Absolute or entirely identical with the Absolute. They have given form to three schools of thought – a) the ''Dualistic school'', b) the ''Quasi-dualistic school'' and c) the ''Monistic school'', as the result of their varying mystical experiences. [[Prakrti]] and [[Atman (Hinduism)|Atman]], when treated as two separate and distinct aspects form the basis of the Dualism of the [[Shvetashvatara Upanishad]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=World Religions|author=Warren Mathews|publisher=Cengage Learning|page=73|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=l_DdHf43iwoC&amp;pg=PA73&amp;lpg=PA73&amp;dq=dualism+in+the+upanishads&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=e2mTvHiD7M&amp;sig=3mYVHCymWz-6ojoK3VZHtk3Q40I&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=w-3aULSvEouzrAf8n4D4Cw&amp;sqi=2&amp;ved=0CEwQ6AEwAw#v=onepage&amp;q=dualism%20in%20the%20upanishads&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; Quasi-dualism is reflected in the Vaishnavite-monotheism of [[Ramanuja]] and the absolute Monism, in the teachings of [[Adi Shankara]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Living in Amida’s Universal Vow|author=Alfred Bloom|publisher=World Wisdom Inc.|page=249|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=KCYMqPcW4M8C&amp;pg=PA249&amp;dq=Quasi-dualism+in+the+upanishads&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=_O_aUKrTDIbtrQeIs4GIBA&amp;ved=0CEAQ6AEwAg#v=onepage&amp;q=Quasi-dualism%20in%20the%20upanishads&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Stages of spiritual experiences==
Self-consciousness is the Fourth state of consciousness or ''Turiya'', the first three being ''Vaisvanara'', ''[[Taijasa]]'' and ''Prajna''. These are the four states of individual consciousness.

There are three distinct stages leading to Self-realisation. The First stage is in mystically apprehending the glory of the Self within us as though we were distinct from it. The Second stage is in identifying the “I-within” with the Self, that we are in essential nature entirely identical with the pure Self. The Third stage is in realising that the [[Atman (Hinduism)|Atman]] is [[Brahman]], that there is no difference between the Self and the Absolute. The Fourth stage is in realising "I am the Absolute" - ''[[Aham Brahman Asmi]]''. The Fifth stage is in realising that Brahman is the “All” that exists, as also that which does not exist.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The constructive survey of Upanishadic philosophy|author=Ramachandra Dattatrya Ranade|publisher=Bharatiya Vidya Bhavan|place=Mumbai|page=203|url=https://archive.org/details/A.Constructive.Survey.of.Upanishadic.Philosophy.by.R.D.Ranade.1926.djvu}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Significance==
The sublime state of self-consciousness is reached after the Seeker after Truth devoid of egoism and delusion, overcoming the flaws of attachment, firm in spirituality, free from lusts, released from dualities called pleasures and pains, the un-deluded repairs to the imperishable status, because for a knower of Brahman who has realised the Ultimate Truth, there is much profit from reservoirs when all around there is an inundation. Through Self-consciousness one gains the knowledge of Existence which is the knowledge of Sole Reality. It is not mere intellectual apprehension of Truth, it is the apprehension of the Oneness which has to be realised here in this very life. In the [[Bhagavad Gita]] XIV.20 Lord [[Krishna]] tells [[Arjuna]] that when the embodied being is able to transcend these three modes or ''gunas'' associated with the material body i.e. ''Sattva'', the mode of goodness, ''Rajas'', the mode of passion and ''Tamasa'', the mode of ignorance, he can become free from birth, death, old age and their distresses and can enjoy nectar even in this life.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Bhagavad-Gita As It Is|author=A.C.Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupada|publisher=The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust|place=Mumbai|page=621|url=http://vedabase.net/bg/|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130109024643/http://vedabase.net/bg/|archivedate=2013-01-09|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Self-consciousness is a positive experience. It is the direct realization of the immortal Brahman - ''he enters into My Being'' - [[Bhagavad Gita]] XIV.19 who is ''the ground of the imperishable Brahman, of immortality, of the eternal virtue and of unending immutable bliss'' - [[Bhagavad Gita]]XIV.27.

[[Multisensory integration]] is necessary for almost every activity that we perform because the combination of multiple sensory inputs is essential for us to comprehend our surroundings.

==Overview==
It has been believed for some time that inputs from different sensory organs are processed in different areas in the brain, relating to [[systems neuroscience]]. Using functional neuroimaging, it can be seen that sensory-specific cortices are activated by different inputs. For example, regions in the [[occipital cortex]] are tied to vision and those on the [[superior temporal gyrus]] are recipients of auditory inputs. There exist studies suggesting deeper multisensory convergences than those at the sensory-specific cortices, which were listed earlier. This convergence of multiple sensory modalities is known as multisensory integration.

Sensory processing deals with how the brain processes sensory input from multiple sensory modalities.  These include the five classic senses of [[Visual perception|vision]] (sight), [[audition]] (hearing), tactile stimulation ([[touch]]), [[olfaction]] (smell), and [[gustation]] (taste).  Other sensory modalities exist, for example the [[vestibular]] sense (balance and the sense of movement) and [[proprioception]] (the sense of knowing one's position in space) Along with [[Time]] (The sense of knowing where one is in time or activities).  It is important that the information of these different sensory modalities must be relatable.  The sensory inputs themselves are in different electrical signals, and in different contexts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Vanzetta I, Grinvald A | title = Coupling between neuronal activity and microcirculation: implications for functional brain imaging | journal = Hfsp Journal | volume = 2 | pages = 79–98| year = 2008 | pmid = 19404475 | issue = 2 | doi = 10.2976/1.2889618 | pmc = 2645573}}&lt;/ref&gt; Through sensory processing, the brain can relate all sensory inputs into a coherent percept, upon which our interaction with the environment is ultimately based.

===Basic structures involved===
The different senses were always thought to be controlled by separate lobes of the brain,&lt;ref name="Pirotte 2008"&gt;{{cite journal  |vauthors=Pirotte B, Voordecker P, Neugroschl C, etal |title=Combination of functional magnetic resonance imaging-guided neuronavigation and intraoperative cortical brain mapping improves targeting of motor cortex stimulation in neuropathic pain |journal=Neurosurgery |volume=62 |issue=6 Suppl 3 |pages=941–56 |date=June 2008 |pmid=18695580 |doi=10.1227/01.neu.0000333762.38500.ac |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; called [[projection areas]]. The lobes of the brain are the classifications that divide the brain both anatomically and functionally.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Hagmann P, Cammoun L, Gigandet X, Meuli R, Honey CJ, et al. .| title = Mapping the Structural Core of Human Cerebral Cortex | journal = PLoS Biology  | volume = 6 |  pages = 1479–1493 | year = 2008 | pmid = 18597554  |doi = 10.1371/journal.pbio.0060159 | pmc=2443193 | editor1-last = Friston | editor1-first = Karl J. | issue = 7}}&lt;/ref&gt; These lobes are the Frontal lobe, responsible for conscious thought, Parietal lobe, responsible for visuospatial processing, the Occipital lobe, responsible for the sense of sight, and the temporal lobe, responsible for the senses of smell and sound.  From the earliest times of neurology, it has been thought that these lobes are solely responsible for their one sensory modality input.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal  |vauthors=Marrelec G, Bellec P, Krainik A, Duffau H, Pelegrini-Isaac M, etal | title = Multisensory Regions, systems, and the brain: Hierarchical measures of functional integration in fMRI | journal = Medical Image Analysis | volume = 12 | pages = 484–496 | year = 2008 | doi = 10.1016/j.media.2008.02.002 | pmid = 18396441 | issue = 4}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, newer research has shown that that may not entirely be the case.

===Problems===
{{Main|Sensory processing disorder}}

Sometimes there can be a problem with the encoding of the sensory information.  This disorder is known as [[Sensory processing disorder|Sensory processing disorder (SPD)]].  This disorder can be further classified into three main types.&lt;ref name="Miller Nielsen 2009"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Miller LJ, Nielsen DM, Schoen SA, Brett-Green BA |title=Perspectives on sensory processing disorder: a call for translational research |journal=Front Integr Neurosci |volume=3 |issue= |pages=22 |year=2009 |pmid=19826493 |pmc=2759332 |doi=10.3389/neuro.07.022.2009 |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  
* Sensory modulation disorder, in which patients seek sensory stimulation due to an over or under response to sensory stimuli.  
* Sensory based motor disorder.  Patients have incorrect processing of motor information that leads to poor motor skills.  
* Sensory processing disorder or sensory discrimination disorder, which is characterized by postural control problems, lack of attentiveness, and disorganization.  
There are several therapies used to treat SPD. [[A. Jean Ayres|Anna Jean Ayres]] claimed that a child needs a healthy "sensory diet," which is all of the activities that children engage in, that gives them the necessary sensory inputs that they need to get their brain into improving sensory processing.

==History==
In the 1930s, [[Wilder Penfield|Dr. Wilder Penfield]] was conducting a very bizarre operation at the Montreal Neurological Institute.&lt;ref name="isbn978-1-4000-6469-4"&gt;{{cite book |author=[[Sandra Blakeslee|Blakeslee, Sandra]]; Blakeslee, Matthew. |title=The Body has a Mind of its Own |publisher=Random House |year=2007 |pages=440 |isbn=978-1-4000-6469-4 |oclc= |doi= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dr. Penfield "pioneered the incorporation of neurophysiological principles in the practice of [[neurosurgery]].&lt;ref name="Todman D. 2008 1104-1105"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Yang F, Kruggel F | title = Automatic segmentation of human brain sulci | journal = Medical Image Analysis| volume = 12 | pages = 442–451| year = 2008 | doi = 10.1016/j.media.2008.01.003 | pmid = 18325826 | issue = 4}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Dr. Penfield was interested in determining a solution to solve the epileptic [[seizure]] problems that his patients were having.   He used an electrode to stimulate different regions of the brain's cortex, and would ask his still conscious patient what he or she felt.  This process led to the publication of his book, The Cerebral Cortex of Man.  The "mapping" of the sensations his patients felt led Dr. Penfield to chart out the sensations that were triggered by stimulating different cortical regions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Seth AK, Dienes Z, Cleeremans A, Overgaard M, Pessoa L | title = Measuring consciousness: relating behavioural and neurophysiological approaches | journal = Trends in Cognitive Sciences | volume = 12 | pages = 314–321 | year = 2008 | doi = 10.1016/j.tics.2008.04.008 | pmid = 18606562 | issue = 8 | pmc = 2767381}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mrs. H. P. Cantlie was the artist Dr. Penfield hired to illustrate his findings.  The result was the conception of the first sensory [[cortical homunculus|Homunculus]].

The [[cortical homunculus|Homonculus]] is a visual representation of the intensity of sensations derived from different parts of the body.  Dr. Wilder Penfield and his colleague [[Herbert Jasper]] developed the [[Montreal procedure]] using an electrode to stimulate different parts of the brain to determine which parts were the cause of the epilepsy.  This part could then be surgically removed or altered in order to regain optimal brain performance.  While performing these tests, they discovered that the [[Wilder Penfield#Neural Stimulation|functional maps]] of the sensory and motor cortices were similar in all patients.  Because of their novelty at the time, these Homonculi were hailed as the "E=mc² of Neuroscience".&lt;ref name="isbn978-1-4000-6469-4"/&gt;

==Current research==
There are still no definitive answers to the questions regarding the relationship between functional and structural asymmetries in the [[brain]].&lt;ref name="Lin SY, Burdine RD. 2005 R343-R345"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Lin SY, Burdine RD | title = Brain asymmetry: Switching from left to right | journal = Current Biology | volume = 15 | issue = 9 | pages = R343–R345 | year = 2005 | doi = 10.1016/j.cub.2005.04.026 | pmid = 15886094}}&lt;/ref&gt;  There are a number of asymmetries in the human brain including how language is processed mainly in the left [[lateralization of brain function|hemisphere of the brain]].  There have been some cases, however, in which individuals have comparable language skills to someone who uses his left hemisphere to process language, yet they mainly use their right or both hemispheres.  These cases pose the possibility that function may not follow structure in some cognitive tasks.&lt;ref name="Lin SY, Burdine RD. 2005 R343-R345"/&gt;  Current research in the fields of sensory processing and multisensory integration is aiming to hopefully unlock the mysteries behind the concept of [[brain lateralization]].

Research on sensory processing has much to offer towards understanding the function of the brain as a whole.  The primary task of multisensory integration is to figure out and sort out the vast quantities of sensory information in the body through multiple sensory modalities.  These modalities not only are not independent, but they are also quite complementary.  Where one sensory modality may give information on one part of a situation, another modality can pick up other necessary information.  Bringing this information together facilitates the better understanding of the physical world around us.

It may seem redundant that we are being provided with [[Multisensory integration|multiple sensory inputs]] about the same object, but that is not necessarily the case.  This so-called "redundant" information is in fact verification that what we are experiencing is in fact happening. [[Perception]]s of the world are based on models that we build of the world.  Sensory information informs these models, but this information can also confuse the models.  [[Illusion|Sensory illusions]] occur when these models do not match up.  For example, where our visual system may fool us in one case, our auditory system can bring us back to a ground reality.  This prevents sensory misrepresentations, because through the combination of multiple sensory modalities, the model that we create is much more robust and gives a better assessment of the situation.  Thinking about it logically, it is far easier to fool one sense than it is to simultaneously fool two or more senses.

==Examples==
One of the earliest sensations is the [[olfactory]] sensation.  Evolutionary, gustation and [[olfaction]] developed together.  This multisensory integration was necessary for early humans in order to ensure that they were receiving proper nutrition from their food, and also to make sure that they were not consuming poisonous materials.{{Citation needed|date=March 2014}}  There are several other sensory integrations that developed early on in the human evolutionary time line.  The integration between vision and audition was necessary for spatial mapping.  Integration between vision and tactile sensations developed along with our finer motor skills including better hand-eye coordination.  While humans developed into [[bipedal]] organisms, balance became exponentially more essential to survival.  The [[multisensory integration]] between visual inputs, [[vestibular system|vestibular]] (balance) inputs, and [[proprioception]] inputs played an important role in our development into upright walkers.

===Audiovisual system===
Perhaps one of the most studied sensory integrations is the relationship between [[Visual system|vision]] and [[auditory system|audition]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Witten IB, Knudsen EI | title = Why Seeing Is Believing: Merging Auditory and Visual Worlds | journal = Neuron | volume = 48 | pages = 489–496| year = 2005 | doi = 10.1016/j.neuron.2005.10.020 | pmid = 16269365 | issue = 3}}&lt;/ref&gt; These two senses perceive the same objects in the world in different ways, and by combining the two, they help us understand this information better.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Burr D |author2=Alais D |author3=S. Martinez-Conde | title = Chapter 14 Combining visual and auditory information | journal = In Progress in Brain Research | pages = 243–258 | year = 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; Vision dominates our perception of the world around us.  This is because visual spatial information is one of the most reliable sensory modalities.  Visual stimuli are recorded directly onto the retina, and there are few, if any, external distortions that provide incorrect information to the brain about the true location of an object.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Huddleston WE, Lewis JW, Phinney RE, DeYoe EA | title = Mapping Auditory and visual attention-based apparent motion share functional parallels | journal = Perception &amp; Psychophysics | volume = 70 |  pages = 1207–1216 | year = 2008 | doi = 10.3758/PP.70.7.1207 | pmid = 18927004 | issue = 7}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other spatial information is not as reliable as visual spatial information.  For example, consider auditory spatial input.  The location of an object can sometimes be determined solely on its sound, but the sensory input can easily be modified or altered, thus giving a less reliable spatial representation of the object.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Jaekl PM | title = Auditory-visual temporal integration measured by shifts in perceived temporal location | journal = Neuroscience Letters | volume = 417 |  pages = 219–224 | year = 2007 | doi = 10.1016/j.neulet.2007.02.029 | pmid = 17428607 | last2 = Harris | first2 = LR | issue = 3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Auditory information therefore is not spatially represented unlike visual stimuli.  But once one has the spatial mapping from the visual information, multisensory integration helps bring the information from both the visual and auditory stimuli together to make a more robust mapping.

There have been studies done that show that a dynamic neural mechanism exists for matching the auditory and visual inputs from an event that stimulates multiple [[sense]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = King, AJ| title = Multisensory Integration: Strategies for Synchronization | journal = Current Biology | volume = 15 | issue = 9 | pages = R339–R341 | year = 2005 | doi = 10.1016/j.cub.2005.04.022 | pmid = 15886092}}&lt;/ref&gt; One example of this that has been observed is how the brain compensates for target distance.  When you are speaking with someone or watching something happen, auditory and visual signals are not being processed concurrently, but they are perceived as being simultaneous.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Bulkin DA, Groh JM | title = Seeing sounds: visual and auditory interactions in the brain | journal = Current Opinion in Neurobiology | volume = 16 |  pages = 415–419 | year = 2006 | doi = 10.1016/j.conb.2006.06.008 | pmid = 16837186 | issue = 4}}&lt;/ref&gt; This kind of [[multisensory integration]] can lead to slight misperceptions in the visual-auditory system in the form of the ventriloquist effect.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Alais D, Burr D | title = The ventriloquist effect results from near-optimal bimodal integration  | journal = Current Biology | volume = 14 |  pages = 257–262 | year = 2004 | pmid = 14761661 | issue = 3 | doi = 10.1016/j.cub.2004.01.029}}&lt;/ref&gt; An example of the ventriloquism effect is when a person on the television appears to have his voice coming from his mouth, rather than the television's speakers.  This occurs because of a pre-existing spatial representation within the brain which is programmed to think that voices come from another human's mouth.  This then makes it so the visual response to the audio input is spatially misrepresented, and therefore misaligned.

===Sensorimotor system===
Hand eye coordination is one example of sensory integration.  In this case, we require a tight integration of what we visually perceive about an object, and what we tactilely perceive about that same object.  If these two senses were not combined within the brain, then one would have less ability to manipulate an object.  Hand-eye coordination is the tactile sensation in the context of the visual system.  The visual system is very static, in that it doesn't move around much, but the hands and other parts used in tactile sensory collection can freely move around.  This movement of the hands must be included in the mapping of both the tactile and visual sensations, otherwise one would not be able to comprehend where they were moving their hands, and what they were touching and looking at.  An example of this happening is looking at an infant.  The infant picks up objects and puts them in his mouth, or touches them to his feet or face.  All of these actions are culminating to the formation of spatial maps in the brain and the realization that "Hey, that thing that's moving this object is actually a part of me."  Seeing the same thing that they are feeling is a major step in the mapping that is required for infants to begin to realize that they can move their arms and interact with an object.  This is the earliest and most explicit way of experiencing sensory integration.

==Further research==
In the future, research on sensory integration will be used to better understand how different sensory modalities are incorporated within the brain to help us perform even the simplest of tasks.  For example, we do not currently have the understanding needed to comprehend how neural circuits transform sensory cues into changes in motor activities.  More research done on the [[Sensory-motor coupling|sensorimotor]] system can help understand how these movements are controlled.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Samuel AD, Sengupta P | title = Sensorimotor integration: Locating locomotion in neural circuits | journal = Current Biology | volume = 15 | pages = R341–R353 | year = 2005 | doi = 10.1016/j.cub.2005.04.021 | pmid = 15886093 | issue = 9}}&lt;/ref&gt; This understanding can potentially be used to learn more about how to make better [[prosthetics]], and eventually help patients who have lost the use of a limb.  Also, by learning more about how different sensory inputs can combine can have profound effects on new engineering approaches using [[robotics]].  The robot's sensory devices may take in inputs of different modalities, but if we understand multisensory integration better, we might be able to program these robots to convey these data into a useful output to better serve our purposes.

In [[anthropology]], '''privilege''' is a special right, advantage, or immunity granted or available only to a particular person or group.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/privilege | title=Privilege &amp;#124; Definition of privilege in English by Oxford Dictionaries}}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[sociology]], privilege is the [[perceived]] rights or advantages that are assumed to be available only to a particular person or group of people.&lt;ref&gt;Lucal, B., 1996.

== History ==
[[File:Du Bois, W. E. B..jpg|thumb|[[W. E. B. Du Bois]], author of the essay ''[[The Souls of Black Folk]].'']]
The concept of privilege dates back to 1903 when American [[sociologist]] and [[historian]] [[W. E. B. Du Bois]] published the essay ''[[The Souls of Black Folk]]'', in which he wrote that although [[African American]]s were observant about [[white Americans]] and conscious of [[Racial Discrimination Act 1975|racial discrimination]], white Americans did not think much about African Americans, nor about the effects of racial discrimination.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Revealing Whiteness: The Unconscious Habits of Racial Privilege|last = Sullivan|first = Shannon|publisher = Indiana University Press|year = 2006|isbn = 978-0253218483|location = |pages = 121–123}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = W.E.B.

In 1988, American [[feminism|feminist]] and anti-racism activist [[Peggy McIntosh]] published the essay ''White Privilege and Male Privilege: A Personal Account of Coming to See Correspondences through Work in Women’s Studies'', in which she documented forty-six privileges which she, as a white person, experienced in the United States. For example: "I can be sure that if I need legal or medical help, my race will not work against me", and "I do not have to educate my children to be aware of [[systemic racism]] for their own daily physical protection". McIntosh described [[white privilege]] as an "invisible package of unearned assets" which white people do not want to acknowledge, and which leads to them being confident, comfortable, and oblivious about racial issues, while non-white people become unconfident, uncomfortable, and alienated.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; McIntosh's essay has been credited for stimulating academic interest in privilege, which has been extensively studied in the decades since.&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;{{Cite book|title = Encyclopedia of Gender and Society|last = O'Brien|first = Jodi A.|publisher = SAGE Publications|year = 2008|isbn = 978-1412909167|location = |pages = 418}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2014, [[Princeton University]] first-year student Tal Fortgang wrote ''Checking My Privilege'', a widely debated article in which he condemned classmates who told him to "check his privilege" for attributing his success in life to "some invisible patron saint of white maleness", and "for casting the equal protection clause, indeed the very idea of a meritocracy, as a myth".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://theprincetontory.com/main/checking-my-privilege-character-as-the-basis-of-privilege/|title=Checking My Privilege: Character as the Basis of Privilege|last=Fortgang|first=Tal|date=2 April 2014|work=The Princeton Tory|accessdate=24 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; McIntosh afterwards told the ''[[New Yorker Magazine|New Yorker]]'' that Fortgang was resisting seeing himself systemically. She argued that everybody has a combination of unearned advantage and unearned disadvantage, and should aim to try to see themselves in the context of societal patterns of discrimination and oppression.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.newyorker.com/online/blogs/books/2014/05/the-woman-who-coined-the-term-white-privilege.html|title=The Origins of Privilege|last=Rothman|first=Joshua|date=13 May 2014|work=The New Yorker|accessdate=24 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Overview ==
Historically, academic study of social inequality focused mainly on the ways in which minority groups were discriminated against, and ignored the privileges accorded to dominant social groups.&lt;ref&gt;Simandan, D., 2018. Rethinking the health consequences of social class and social mobility. Social Science &amp; Medicine. Vol. 200, pp. 258-261. https://doi.org/10.1016/j.socscimed.2017.11.037 .&lt;/ref&gt; That changed in the late 1980s, when researchers began studying the concept of privilege.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;

Privilege, as understood and described by researchers, is a function of multiple variables of varying importance, such as [[racism|race]], [[ageism|age]], [[genderism|gender]], [[heteronormativity|sexual orientation]], [[gender identity]], [[citizenship]], [[religion]], [[physical ability]], health, level of education, and others. Race, gender and social class are generally felt by sociologists to be the most determinative of a person's overall level of privilege.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = The Archaeology of Plural and Changing Identities: Beyond Identification|last = Casella|first = Eleanor C.|publisher = Springer|year = 2005|isbn = 9780306486944|location = |pages = 217|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6tNhM_dsYIoC&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; Privilege theory argues that each individual is embedded in a matrix of categories and contexts, and will be in some ways privileged and other ways disadvantaged, with privileged attributes lessening disadvantage and membership in a disadvantaged group lessening the benefits of privilege.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite book|title = Psychological Perspectives on Lesbian, Gay, and Bisexual Experiences|last = Garnets|first = Linda|publisher = Columbia University Press|year = 2002|isbn = 978-0231124133|location = |pages = 391}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, a white [[lesbian]] [[Professor|university professor]] benefits from racial and educational privilege, but is disadvantaged due to her gender and sexual orientation.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; Some attributes of privilege are ordinarily fairly visible, such as race and gender, and others, such as citizenship status and birth order, are not. Some such as social class are relatively stable and others, such as age, wealth, religion and attractiveness, will or may change over time.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Gender in the Therapy Hour: Voices of Female Clinicians Working with Men (The Routledge Series on Counseling and Psychotherapy with Boys and Men)|last = Sweet|first = Holly Barlow|publisher = Routledge|year = 2012|isbn = 978-0415885515|location = |pages = 71}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some attributes of privilege are at least partly determined by the individual, such as level of education, whereas others such as race or class background are entirely involuntary.

In the context of the theory, privileged people are considered to be "the norm", and, as such, gain invisibility and ease in society, with others being cast as inferior variants.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; Privileged people see themselves reflected throughout society both in mass media and face-to-face in their encounters with teachers, workplace managers and other authorities, which researchers argue leads to a sense of entitlement and the assumption that the privileged person will succeed in life, as well as protecting the privileged person from worry that they may face discrimination from people in positions of authority.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Intercultural Communication: Globalization and Social Justice|last = Sorrells|first = Kathryn|publisher = SAGE Publications|year = 2012|isbn = 978-1412927444|location = |pages = 63}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Awareness of privilege ==
Some academics{{such as|date=October 2018}} highlight a pattern where those who benefit from a type of privilege are unwilling to acknowledge it.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Handbook of Racial-Cultural Psychology and Counseling, Training and Practice|last = Carter|first = Robert T.|publisher = Wiley|year = 2004|isbn = 978-0471386292|location = |pages = 432}}&lt;/ref&gt; American sociologist [[Michael Kimmel]] describes the state of having privilege as being "like running with the wind at your back", unaware of invisible sustenance, support and propulsion.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; The argument may follow that such a denial constitutes a further injustice against those who do not benefit from the same form of privilege.  One writer{{who|date=October 2018}} has referred to such denial as a form of "[[microaggression]]" or microinvalidation that negates the experiences of people who don't have privilege and minimizes the impediments they face.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite book|title = Microaggressions in Everyday Life: Race, Gender, and Sexual Orientation|last = Sue|first = Derald Wing|publisher = Wiley|year = 2010|isbn = 978-0470491409|location = |pages = 37–39}}&lt;/ref&gt;

McIntosh wrote that most people are reluctant to acknowledge their privilege, and instead look for ways to justify or minimize the effects of privilege stating that their privilege was fully earned. They justify this by acknowledging the acts of individuals of unearned dominance, but deny that privilege is institutionalized as well as embedded throughout our society. She wrote that those who believe privilege is systemic may nonetheless deny having personally benefited from it, and may oppose efforts to dismantle it.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; According to researchers{{who|date=October 2018}}, privileged individuals resist acknowledging their privileges because doing so would require them to acknowledge that whatever success they have achieved did not result solely through their own efforts. Instead it was partly due to a system that has developed to support them.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; The concept of privilege calls into question the idea that society is a [[meritocracy]], which researchers{{who|date=October 2018}} have argued is particularly unsettling for Americans for whom belief that they live in a meritocracy is a deeply held cultural value, and one that researchers commonly characterize as a [[Meritocracy#Criticism|myth]].&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{Cite book|title = Deconstructing Privilege: Teaching and Learning as Allies in the Classroom|last = Case|first = Kim|publisher = Routledge|year = 2013|isbn = 978-0415641463|location = |pages =63–64 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Privilege: The Making of an Adolescent Elite at St. Paul's School (Princeton Studies in Cultural Sociology)|last = Khan|first = Shamus Rahman|publisher = Princeton University Press|year = 2012|isbn = 978-0691156231|location = |pages = 107–108}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Encyclopedia of Multicultural Psychology|last = Jackson|first = Yolanda Kaye|publisher = SAGE Publications|location = |pages = 471 |isbn=9781452265568 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=AP1yAwAAQBAJ |year=2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''The Gendered Society'', Michael Kimmel wrote that when privileged people do not feel personally powerful, arguments that they have benefited from unearned advantages seem unpersuasive.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite book|title = Seeing White: An Introduction to White Privilege and Race|last = Halley|first = Jean|publisher = Rowman &amp; Littlefield Publishers|year = 2011|isbn = 978-1442203075|location = |pages = 67, 191}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Explain|date=January 2018}}

=== Examples of Privilege ===

====Workplace sexism====
{{synthesis|reason="Is that statistically significant?"|date=October 2018}}
Hays, a recruitment firm, sent the same job application to thousands of employers, only changing the name. One was "Simon", the other "Susan". Experienced hiring managers offered "Simon" an interview 15% more often than "Susan".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.news.com.au/finance/work/careers/the-same-resume-with-different-names-nets-different-results/news-story/a2a182fb4570e948c27ce63139ee66b1 | title=The same resume with different names nets different results}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Educational Racism====
According to McKinley et al.
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Students of color are pushed toward academic failure and continued social disenfranchisement. Racist policies and beliefs, in part, explain why children and young adults from racially marginalized groups fail to achieve academically at the same rate as their White peers.&lt;ref&gt;Bryan McKinley Jones Brayboy, Angelina E. Castagno and Emma Maughan
Review of Research in Education 
Vol. 31, Difference, Diversity, and Distinctiveness in Education and Learning (2007), pp. 159-194&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

== Criticism ==
The concept of privilege has been criticized for ignoring relative differences among groups. For example, Lawrence Blum argued that in American culture there are status differences among [[Chinese American|Chinese]], [[Japanese American|Japanese]], [[Indian American|Indians]], [[Korean American|Koreans]], and [[Cambodian American|Cambodians]], and among [[African American]]s, black immigrants from the [[Caribbean American|Caribbean]], and black immigrants from [[Africa]].&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.faculty.umb.edu/lawrence_blum/publications/publications/A57.pdf|title='White privilege': A mild critique|first=Lawrence|last=Blum|date=2008|journal=Theory and Research in Education|volume=6|doi=10.1177/1477878508095586|issue=6(3) |pages=309–321|accessdate=23 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Blum agreed that privilege exists and is systemic yet nonetheless criticized the label itself, saying that the word "privilege" implies luxuries rather than rights, and arguing that some benefits of privilege such as unimpeded access to [[education]] and [[housing]] would be better understood as rights.&lt;ref name=":4"/&gt; "[[White privilege]]", Michael Monahan argued, would be more accurately described as the advantages gained by whites through historical disenfranchisement of non-whites rather than something that gives whites privilege above and beyond normal human status.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Monahan, Michael J.|year=2014|title=The concept of privilege: a critical appraisal|journal=South African Journal of Philosophy|volume=3|issue=1|pages=73–83|doi=10.1080/02580136.2014.892681|issn=0258-0136|eissn=2073-4867}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Lie groups |Homogeneous spaces}}
In [[differential geometry]], [[representation theory]] and [[harmonic analysis]], a '''symmetric space''' is a [[pseudo-Riemannian manifold]] whose group of symmetries contains an inversion symmetry about every point. This can be made more precise, in either the language of [[Riemannian geometry]] or of [[Lie theory]]. The Riemannian definition is more geometric, and plays a deep role in the theory of [[holonomy]]. 
The Lie-theoretic definition is more algebraic.

In [[Riemannian geometry]], a complete, simply connected Riemannian manifold is a symmetric space if and only if its curvature tensor is invariant under parallel transport. More generally, a Riemannian manifold (''M'', ''g'') is said to be symmetric if and only if, for each point ''p'' of ''M'', there exists an isometry of ''M'' fixing ''p'' and acting on the tangent space &lt;math&gt;T_pM&lt;/math&gt; of ''M'' at ''p'' by minus the identity. 
Any symmetric space is complete, and has a finite cover which is a simply connected symmetric space; thus these two characterizations in fact coincide up to finite covers. Both descriptions can also naturally be extended to the setting of [[pseudo-Riemannian manifold]]s.

From the point of view of [[Lie theory]], a symmetric space is the quotient ''G''/''H'' of Lie group ''G'' by a Lie subgroup ''H'', where the [[Lie algebra]] &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak h&lt;/math&gt; of ''H'' is also required to be the +1-eigenspace of an [[involution (mathematics)|involution]] of the Lie algebra &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak g&lt;/math&gt; of ''G''. 
As stated, this characterization includes pseudo-Riemannian spaces as well as a Riemannian ones; extra algebraic conditions are needed to restrict to the Riemannian case.

Riemannian symmetric spaces arise in a wide variety of situations in both mathematics and physics. They were first classified by [[Élie Cartan]]. Their central role in the theory of [[holonomy]] was discovered by [[Marcel Berger]]. They are important objects of study in representation theory and harmonic analysis as well as in differential geometry.

==Definition using geodesic symmetries==
Let ''M'' be a connected Riemannian manifold and ''p'' a point of ''M''. An automorphism ''f'' of a neighborhood of ''p'' is said to be a '''geodesic symmetry''' if it fixes the point ''p'' and reverses geodesics through that point, i.e. if ''γ'' is a geodesic and &lt;math&gt; \gamma(0)=p&lt;/math&gt; then &lt;math&gt;f(\gamma(t))=\gamma(-t).&lt;/math&gt; It follows that the derivative of the map at ''p'' is minus the identity map on the  [[tangent space]] of ''p''. On a general Riemannian manifold, ''f'' need not be isometric, nor can it be extended, in general, from a neighbourhood of ''p'' to all of ''M''.

''M'' is said to be '''locally Riemannian symmetric''' if its geodesic symmetries are in fact isometric. This is equivalent to the vanishing of the covariant derivative of the curvature tensor. 
A locally symmetric space is said to be a '''(globally)  symmetric space''' if, in addition, its geodesic symmetries are defined on all of ''M''.

===Basic properties===
The [[Cartan&amp;ndash;Ambrose&amp;ndash;Hicks theorem]] implies that ''M'' is locally Riemannian symmetric [[if and only if]] its curvature tensor is [[covariant derivative|covariantly constant]], and furthermore that any [[simply connected]], [[complete space|complete]] locally Riemannian symmetric space is actually Riemannian symmetric.

Any Riemannian symmetric space ''M'' is complete and Riemannian [[homogeneous space|homogeneous]] (meaning that the isometry group of ''M'' acts transitively on ''M''). In fact, already the identity component of the isometry group acts transitively on ''M'' (because ''M'' is connected).
 
Locally Riemannian symmetric spaces that are not Riemannian symmetric may be constructed as quotients of Riemannian symmetric spaces by discrete groups of isometries with no fixed points, and as open subsets of (locally) Riemannian symmetric spaces.

===Examples===
Basic examples of Riemannian symmetric spaces are [[Euclidean space]], [[sphere]]s, [[projective space]]s, and [[hyperbolic space]]s, each with their standard Riemannian metrics. More examples are provided by compact, semi-simple [[Lie groups]] equipped with a bi-invariant Riemannian metric. An example of a non-Riemannian symmetric space is [[anti-de Sitter space]].

Any compact Riemann surface of genus greater than 1 (with its usual metric of constant curvature &amp;minus;1) is a locally symmetric space but not a symmetric space.

==General definition==
Let ''G'' be a connected [[Lie group]]. Then a '''symmetric space''' for ''G'' is a homogeneous space ''G''/''H'' where the stabilizer ''H'' of a typical point is an open subgroup of the fixed point set of an [[involution (mathematics)|involution]] ''σ'' in ''Aut(G)''. Thus ''σ'' is an automorphism of ''G'' with ''σ''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = id&lt;sub&gt;''G''&lt;/sub&gt; and ''H'' is an open subgroup of the set
: &lt;math&gt; G^\sigma=\{ g\in G: \sigma(g) = g\}.&lt;/math&gt;
Because ''H'' is open, it is a union of components of ''G''&lt;sup&gt;''σ''&lt;/sup&gt; (including, of course, the identity component).

As an automorphism of ''G'', ''σ'' fixes the identity element, and hence, by differentiating at the identity, it induces an automorphism of the Lie algebra &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak g&lt;/math&gt; of ''G'', also denoted by ''σ'', whose square is the identity. It follows that the eigenvalues of ''σ'' are ±1. The +1 eigenspace is the Lie algebra &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak h&lt;/math&gt; of ''H'' (since this is the Lie algebra of ''G''&lt;sup&gt;''σ''&lt;/sup&gt;), and the −1 eigenspace will be denoted &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak m&lt;/math&gt;. Since ''σ'' is an automorphism of &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak g&lt;/math&gt;, this gives a [[direct sum of Lie algebras|direct sum]] decomposition
:&lt;math&gt; \mathfrak g = \mathfrak h\oplus\mathfrak m&lt;/math&gt;
with
:&lt;math&gt; [\mathfrak h,\mathfrak h]\subset \mathfrak h,\; [\mathfrak h,\mathfrak m]\subset \mathfrak m,\; [\mathfrak m,\mathfrak m]\subset \mathfrak h.&lt;/math&gt;
The first condition is automatic for any homogeneous space: it just says the infinitesimal stabilizer &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak h&lt;/math&gt; is a Lie subalgebra of &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak g&lt;/math&gt;. The second condition means that &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak m&lt;/math&gt; is an &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak h&lt;/math&gt;-invariant complement to &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak h&lt;/math&gt; in &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak g&lt;/math&gt;. Thus any symmetric space is a [[reductive homogeneous space]], but there are many reductive homogeneous spaces which are not symmetric spaces. The key feature of symmetric spaces is the third condition that &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak m&lt;/math&gt; brackets into &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak h&lt;/math&gt;.

Conversely, given any Lie algebra &lt;math&gt; \mathfrak g&lt;/math&gt; with a direct sum decomposition satisfying these three conditions, the linear map ''σ'', equal to the identity on &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak h&lt;/math&gt; and minus the identity on &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak m&lt;/math&gt;, is an involutive automorphism.

==Riemannian symmetric spaces satisfy  the Lie-theoretic characterization==
If ''M'' is a Riemannian symmetric space, the identity component ''G'' of the isometry group of ''M'' is a [[Lie group]] acting transitively on ''M'' (''M'' is Riemannian homogeneous). Therefore, if we fix some point ''p'' of ''M'', ''M'' is diffeomorphic to the quotient ''G/K'', where ''K'' denotes the [[isotropy group]] of the action of ''G'' on ''M'' at ''p''. By differentiating the action at ''p'' we obtain an isometric action of ''K'' on T&lt;sub&gt;''p''&lt;/sub&gt;''M''. This action is faithful (e.g., by a theorem of Kostant, any isometry in the identity component is determined by its [[jet bundle|1-jet]] at any point) and so ''K'' is a subgroup of the orthogonal group of T&lt;sub&gt;''p''&lt;/sub&gt;''M'', hence compact. Moreover, if we denote by ''s''&lt;sub&gt;''p''&lt;/sub&gt;: M → M the geodesic symmetry of ''M'' at ''p'', the map
:&lt;math&gt;\sigma: G \to G, h \mapsto s_p \circ h \circ s_p&lt;/math&gt;
is an [[Involution (mathematics)|involutive]] Lie group [[automorphism]] such that the isotropy group ''K'' is contained between the fixed point group of ''σ'' and its identity component (hence an open subgroup).

To summarize, ''M'' is a symmetric space ''G''/''K'' with a compact isotropy group ''K''. Conversely, symmetric spaces with compact isotropy group are Riemannian symmetric spaces, although not necessarily in a unique way. To obtain a Riemannian symmetric space structure we need to fix a ''K''-invariant inner product on the tangent space to ''G''/''K'' at the identity coset ''eK'': such an inner product always exists by averaging, since ''K'' is compact, and by acting with ''G'', we obtain a ''G''-invariant Riemannian metric ''g'' on ''G''/''K''.

To show that ''G''/''K'' is Riemannian symmetric, consider any point ''p'' = ''hK'' (a coset of ''K'', where ''h'' ∈ ''G'') and define
:&lt;math&gt;s_p: M \to M, h'K \mapsto h \sigma(h^{-1}h')K&lt;/math&gt;
where ''σ'' is the involution of ''G'' fixing ''K''. Then one can check that ''s''&lt;sub&gt;''p''&lt;/sub&gt; is an isometry with (clearly) ''s''&lt;sub&gt;''p''&lt;/sub&gt;(''p'') = ''p'' and (by differentiating) d''s''&lt;sub&gt;''p''&lt;/sub&gt;  equal to minus the identity on T&lt;sub&gt;''p''&lt;/sub&gt;''M''. Thus ''s''&lt;sub&gt;''p''&lt;/sub&gt; is a geodesic symmetry and, since ''p'' was arbitrary, ''M'' is a Riemannian symmetric space.

If one starts with a Riemannian symmetric space ''M'', and then performs these two constructions in sequence, then the Riemannian symmetric space yielded is isometric to the original one. This shows that the "algebraic data" (''G'',''K'',''σ'',''g'') completely describe the structure of ''M''.

==Classification of Riemannian symmetric spaces==
{{main|List of simple Lie groups}}

The algebraic description of Riemannian symmetric spaces enabled [[Élie Cartan]] to obtain a complete classification of them in 1926.

For a given Riemannian symmetric space ''M'' let (''G'',''K'',''σ'',''g'') be the algebraic data associated to it. To classify the possible isometry classes of ''M'', first note that the [[universal cover]] of a Riemannian symmetric space is again Riemannian symmetric, and the covering map is described by dividing the connected isometry group ''G'' of the covering by a subgroup of its center. Therefore, we may suppose without loss of generality that ''M'' is simply connected. (This implies ''K'' is connected by the [[long exact sequence of a fibration]], because ''G'' is connected by assumption.)

===Classification scheme===
A simply connected Riemannian symmetric space is said to be '''irreducible''' if it is not the product of two or more Riemannian symmetric spaces. It can then be shown that any simply connected Riemannian symmetric space is a Riemannian product of irreducible ones. Therefore, we may further restrict ourselves to classifying the irreducible, simply connected Riemannian symmetric spaces.

The next step is to show that any irreducible, simply connected Riemannian symmetric space ''M'' is of one of the following three types:

1. '''Euclidean type''': ''M'' has vanishing curvature, and is therefore isometric to a [[Euclidean space]].

2. '''Compact type''': ''M'' has nonnegative (but not identically zero) [[sectional curvature]].

3. '''Non-compact type''': ''M'' has nonpositive (but not identically zero) sectional curvature.

A more refined invariant is the '''rank''', which is the maximum dimension of a subspace of the tangent space (to any point) on which the curvature is identically zero. The rank is always at least one, with equality if the sectional curvature is positive or negative.  If the curvature is positive, the space is of compact type, and if negative, it is of  noncompact type.  The spaces of Euclidean type have rank equal to their dimension and are isometric to a Euclidean space of that dimension. Therefore, it remains to classify the irreducible, simply connected Riemannian symmetric spaces of compact and non-compact type. In both cases there are two classes.

A. ''G'' is a (real) simple Lie group;

B. ''G'' is either the product of a compact simple Lie group with itself (compact type), or a complexification of such a Lie group (non-compact type).

The examples in class B are completely described by the classification of [[simple Lie group]]s. For compact type, ''M'' is a compact simply connected simple Lie group, ''G'' is ''M''&amp;times;''M'' and ''K'' is the diagonal subgroup. For non-compact type, ''G'' is a simply connected complex simple Lie group and ''K'' is its maximal compact subgroup. In both cases, the rank is the [[rank of a Lie group|rank of ''G'']].

The compact simply connected Lie groups are the universal covers of the classical Lie groups &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{SO}(n)&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{SU}(n)&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{Sp}(n)&lt;/math&gt; and the five [[Exceptional Lie group#Exceptional algebras|exceptional Lie groups]] ''E&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;'', ''E&lt;sub&gt;7&lt;/sub&gt;'', ''E&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt;'', ''F&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;'', ''G&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;''.

The examples of class A are completely described by the classification of noncompact simply connected real simple Lie groups. For non-compact type, ''G'' is such a group and ''K'' is its maximal compact subgroup. Each such example has a corresponding example of compact type, by considering a maximal compact subgroup of the complexification of ''G'' which contains ''K''. More directly, the examples of compact type are classified by involutive automorphisms of compact simply connected simple Lie groups ''G'' (up to conjugation). Such involutions extend to involutions of the complexification of ''G'', and these in turn classify non-compact real forms of ''G''.

In both class A and class B there is thus a correspondence between symmetric spaces of compact type and non-compact type. This is known as duality for Riemannian symmetric spaces.

===Classification result===
Specializing to the Riemannian symmetric spaces of class A and compact type, Cartan found that there are the following seven infinite series and twelve exceptional Riemannian symmetric spaces ''G''/''K''. They are here given in terms of ''G'' and ''K'', together with a geometric interpretation, if readily available. The labelling of these spaces is the one given by Cartan.

===As Grassmannians===
A more modern classification {{Harv|Huang|Leung|2011}} uniformly classifies the Riemannian symmetric spaces, both compact and non-compact, via a [[Freudenthal magic square]] construction. The irreducible compact Riemannian symmetric spaces are, up to finite covers, either a compact simple Lie group, a Grassmannian, a [[Lagrangian Grassmannian]], or a [[double Lagrangian Grassmannian]] of subspaces of &lt;math&gt;(\mathbf A \otimes \mathbf B)^n,&lt;/math&gt; for normed division algebras '''A''' and '''B'''. A similar construction produces the irreducible non-compact Riemannian symmetric spaces.

==Symmetric spaces in general==

An important class of symmetric spaces generalizing the Riemannian symmetric spaces are '''pseudo-Riemannian symmetric spaces''', in which the Riemannian metric is replaced by a [[pseudo-Riemannian metric]] (nondegenerate instead of positive definite on each tangent space). In particular, '''Lorentzian symmetric spaces''', i.e., ''n'' dimensional pseudo-Riemannian symmetric spaces of signature (''n''&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;1,1), are important in [[general relativity]], the most notable examples being [[Minkowski space]], [[De Sitter space]] and [[anti-de Sitter space]] (with zero, positive and negative curvature respectively). De Sitter space of dimension ''n'' may be identified with the 1-sheeted hyperboloid in a Minkowski space of dimension ''n''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;1.

Symmetric and locally symmetric spaces in general can be regarded as affine symmetric spaces. If ''M'' = ''G''/''H'' is a symmetric space, then Nomizu showed that there is a ''G''-invariant torsion-free [[affine connection]] (i.e. an affine connection whose [[torsion tensor]] vanishes) on ''M'' whose [[curvature of a connection|curvature]] is [[parallel transport|parallel]]. Conversely a manifold with such a connection is locally symmetric (i.e., its [[universal cover]] is a symmetric space). Such manifolds can also be described as those affine manifolds whose geodesic symmetries are all globally defined affine diffeomorphisms, generalizing the Riemannian and pseudo-Riemannian case.

===Classification results===
The classification of Riemannian symmetric spaces does not extend readily to the general case for the simple reason that there is no general splitting of a symmetric space into a product of irreducibles. Here a symmetric space ''G''/''H'' with Lie algebra
:&lt;math&gt;\mathfrak g = \mathfrak h\oplus \mathfrak m&lt;/math&gt;
is said to be irreducible if &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak m&lt;/math&gt; is an [[irreducible representation]] of &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak h&lt;/math&gt;. Since  &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak h&lt;/math&gt; is not semisimple (or even reductive) in general, it can have [[indecomposable module|indecomposable]] representations which are not irreducible.

However, the irreducible symmetric spaces can be classified. As shown by [[Katsumi Nomizu]], there is a dichotomy: an irreducible symmetric space ''G''/''H'' is either flat (i.e., an affine space) or &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak g&lt;/math&gt; is semisimple. This is the analogue of the Riemannian dichotomy between Euclidean spaces and those of compact or noncompact type, and it motivated M. Berger to classify semisimple symmetric spaces (i.e., those with  &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak g&lt;/math&gt;  semisimple) and determine which of these are irreducible. The latter question is more subtle than in the Riemannian case: even if &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak g&lt;/math&gt; is simple, ''G''/''H'' might not be irreducible.

As in the Riemannian case there are semisimple symmetric spaces with ''G'' = ''H'' &amp;times; ''H''. Any semisimple symmetric space is a product of symmetric spaces of this form with symmetric spaces such that &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak g&lt;/math&gt; is simple. It remains to describe the latter case. For this, one needs to classify involutions ''σ'' of a (real) simple Lie algebra &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak g&lt;/math&gt;. If &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak g^c&lt;/math&gt; is not simple, then &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak g&lt;/math&gt; is a complex simple Lie algebra, and the corresponding symmetric spaces have the form ''G''/''H'', where ''H'' is a real form of ''G'': these are the analogues of the Riemannian symmetric spaces ''G''/''K'' with ''G'' a complex simple Lie group, and ''K'' a maximal compact subgroup.

Thus we may assume &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak g^c&lt;/math&gt; is simple. The real subalgebra &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak g&lt;/math&gt; may be viewed as the fixed point set of a complex [[antilinear]] involution ''τ'' of &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak g^c&lt;/math&gt;, while ''σ'' extends to a complex antilinear involution of &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak g^c&lt;/math&gt; commuting with ''τ'' and hence also a complex linear involution ''σ''∘''τ''.

The classification therefore reduces to the classification of commuting pairs of antilinear involutions of a complex Lie algebra. The composite ''σ''∘''τ'' determines a complex symmetric space, while ''τ'' determines a real form. From this it is easy to construct tables of symmetric spaces for any given &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak g^c&lt;/math&gt;, and furthermore, there is an obvious duality given by exchanging ''σ'' and ''τ''. This extends the compact/non-compact duality from the Riemannian case, where either ''σ'' or ''τ'' is a [[Cartan involution]], i.e., its fixed point set is a maximal compact subalgebra.

==Weakly symmetric Riemannian spaces==
{{main|Weakly symmetric space}}
In the 1950s [[Atle Selberg]] extended Cartan's definition of symmetric space to that of '''weakly symmetric Riemannian space''', or in current terminology '''weakly symmetric space'''. These are defined as Riemannian manifolds ''M''  with a transitive connected Lie group of isometries ''G'' and an isometry σ normalising ''G'' such that given ''x'', ''y'' in ''M'' there is an isometry ''s'' in ''G'' such that ''sx'' =   σ''y'' and ''sy'' = σ''x''. (Selberg's assumption that σ&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; should be an element of ''G'' was later shown to be unnecessary by [[Ernest Vinberg]].) Selberg proved that weakly symmetric spaces give rise to [[Gelfand pair]]s, so that in particular the [[unitary representation]] of ''G'' on ''L''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;(''M'') is multiplicity free.

Selberg's definition can also be phrased equivalently in terms of a generalization of geodesic symmetry. It is required that for every point ''x'' in ''M'' and tangent vector ''X'' at ''x'', there is an isometry ''s'' of ''M'', depending on ''x'' and ''X'', such that

*''s'' fixes ''x'';
*the derivative of ''s'' at ''x'' sends ''X'' to –''X''.

When ''s'' is independent of ''X'', ''M'' is a symmetric space. 
 
An account of weakly symmetric spaces and their classification by Akhiezer and Vinberg, based on the classification of periodic automorphisms of complex [[semisimple Lie algebra]]s, is given in {{harvtxt|Wolf|2007}}.

==Applications and special cases==

===Symmetric spaces and holonomy===
{{main|Holonomy group}}

If the identity component of the [[holonomy group#Riemannian holonomy|holonomy group]] of a Riemannian manifold at a point acts irreducibly on the tangent space, then either the manifold is a locally Riemannian symmetric space, or it is in one of [[holonomy group#The Berger classification|7 families]].

===Hermitian symmetric spaces===
{{main|Hermitian symmetric space}}

A Riemannian symmetric space which is additionally equipped with a parallel complex structure compatible with the Riemannian metric is called a [[Hermitian symmetric space]]. Some examples are complex vector spaces and complex projective spaces, both with their usual Riemannian metric, and the complex unit balls with suitable metrics so that they become complete and Riemannian symmetric.

An irreducible symmetric space ''G''/''K'' is Hermitian if and only if ''K'' contains a central circle. A quarter turn by this circle acts as multiplication by ''i'' on the tangent space at the identity coset. Thus the Hermitian symmetric spaces are easily read off of the classification. In both the compact and the non-compact cases it turns out that there are four infinite series, namely AIII, BDI with ''p=2'', DIII and CI, and two exceptional spaces, namely EIII and EVII. The non-compact Hermitian symmetric spaces can be realized as bounded symmetric domains in complex vector spaces.

===Quaternion-Kähler symmetric spaces===
{{main|Quaternion-Kähler symmetric space}}

A Riemannian symmetric space which is additionally equipped with a parallel subbundle of End(T''M'') isomorphic to the imaginary quaternions at each point, and compatible with the Riemannian metric, is called [[Quaternion-Kähler symmetric space]].

An irreducible symmetric space ''G''/''K'' is quaternion-Kähler if and only if isotropy representation of ''K'' contains an Sp(1) summand acting like the [[unit quaternion]]s on a [[quaternionic vector space]]. Thus the quaternion-Kähler symmetric spaces are easily read off from the classification. In both the compact and the non-compact cases it turns out that there is exactly one for each complex simple Lie group, namely AI with ''p''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;2 or ''q''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;2 (these are isomorphic),  BDI with ''p''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;4 or ''q''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;4, CII with ''p''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;1 or ''q''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;1, EII, EVI, EIX, FI and&amp;nbsp;G.

===Bott periodicity theorem===
{{main|Bott periodicity theorem}}

In the [[Bott periodicity theorem]], the [[loop spaces]] of the stable [[orthogonal group]] can be interpreted as reductive symmetric spaces.

In [[scientific visualization]] a '''tensor glyph''' is an object that can visualize all or most of the nine degrees of freedom, such as [[acceleration]], twist, or [[shear matrix|shear]] – of a &lt;math&gt;3 \times 3&lt;/math&gt; matrix. It is used for [[tensor field]] visualization, where a data-matrix is available at every point in the grid. "Glyphs, or icons, depict multiple data values by mapping them onto the shape, size, orientation, and surface appearance of a base geometric primitive."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.cs.utah.edu/~gk/papers/vissym04/vissym04kindlmann.pdf | title=Superquadric Tensor Glyphs | work=Joint EUROGRAPHICS – IEEE TCVG Symposium on Visualization (2004) | year=2004 | accessdate=September 1, 2012 | author=Kindlmann, Gordon}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tensor glyphs are a particular case of multivariate data [[Glyph (data visualization)|glyphs]].

There are certain types of glyphs that are commonly used:
* Ellipsoid
* Cuboid
* Cylindrical
* [[Superquadrics]]

According to Thomas Schultz and [[Gordon Kindlmann]], specific types of tensor fields "play a central role in scientific and biomedical studies as well as in image analysis
and feature-extraction methods."&lt;ref name="schultz"&gt;{{cite journal | url=http://people.cs.uchicago.edu/~glk/sqd/schultzTVCG10SuperquadricTensorGlyphs.pdf | title=Superquadric Glyphs for Symmetric Second-Order Tensors | author=Schultz, Thomas and Gordon L.

In [[computer science]], a '''type family''' associates [[data type]]s with other [[data type]]s, using a type-level [[function (mathematics)|function]] defined by an open-ended collection of valid instances of input types and the corresponding output types.&lt;ref name="FunWithTypeFunctions"&gt;{{cite web|title=Fun with Type Functions|year=2010|last1=Kiselyov|first1=Oleg|last2=Peyton Jones|first2=Simon|last3=Shan|first3=Chung-chieh|url=http://research.microsoft.com/~simonpj/papers/assoc-types/fun-with-type-funs/typefun.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Type families are a feature of some [[type system]]s that allow partial functions between types to be defined by [[pattern matching]]. This is in contrast to data [[type constructor]]s, which define [[injective]] functions from all types of a particular [[kind (type theory)|kind]] to a new set of types, and type synonyms (a.k.a. [[typedef]]), which define functions from all types of a particular kind to another existing set of types using a single case.

Type families and [[type class]]es are closely related: normal type classes define partial functions from types to a collection of named ''values'' by pattern matching on the input types, while type families define partial functions from types to ''types'' by pattern matching on the input types. In fact, in many uses of type families there is a single type class which logically contains both values and types associated with each instance. A type family declared inside a type class is called an '''associated type'''.&lt;ref name="AssociatedTypesWithClass"&gt;{{cite journal|title=Associated Types with Class|last1=Chakravarty|first1=Manuel M. T.|last2=Keller|first2=Gabriele|last3=Peyton Jones|first3=Simon|last4=Marlow|first4=Simon|journal=Proceedings of the 32nd Annual ACM SIGPLAN-SIGACT Symposium on Principles of Programming Languages|pages=1–13|publisher=ACM Press|year=2005|url=http://www.cse.unsw.edu.au/~chak/papers/CKPM05.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Programming language]]s with support for type families or similar features include [[Haskell (programming language)|Haskell]] (with a common language extension),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Type Functions, Type Families, and Associated Types in GHC - The Master Plan|url=http://hackage.haskell.org/trac/ghc/wiki/TypeFunctions|accessdate=23 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Standard ML]] (through its module system),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=ML Modules and Haskell Type Classes: A Constructive Comparison|year=2008|last1=Wehr|first1=Stefan|last2=Chakravarty|first2=Manuel M. T.|journal=Proceedings of the Sixth ASIAN Symposium on Programming Languages and Systems|publisher=Springer-Verlag|url=http://www.cse.unsw.edu.au/~chak/papers/WC06.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Scala (programming language)|Scala]] (under the name "abstract types"),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=A Tour of Scala: Abstract Types|url=http://www.scala-lang.org/node/105|accessdate=23 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[C++]] (through use of typedefs in templates).&lt;ref name="AssociatedTypeSynonyms" /&gt;

== Variations ==
The &lt;code&gt;TypeFamilies&lt;/code&gt; extension in the [[Glasgow Haskell Compiler]] supports both ''type synonym families'' and ''data families''. Type synonym families are the more flexible (but harder to type-check) form, permitting the types in the [[codomain]] of the type function to be any type whatsoever with the appropriate [[kind (type theory)|kind]].&lt;ref name="AssociatedTypeSynonyms"&gt;{{cite journal|title=Associated Type Synonyms|last1=Chakravarty|first1=Manuel M. T.|last2=Keller|first2=Gabriele|last3=Peyton Jones|first3=Simon|journal=Proceedings of the Tenth ACM SIGPLAN International Conference on Functional Programming|pages=241–253|publisher=ACM Press|year=2005|url=http://www.cse.unsw.edu.au/~chak/papers/CKP05.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; Data families, on the other hand, restrict the codomain by requiring each instance to define a new [[type constructor]] for the function's result. This ensures that the function is [[injective]], allowing clients' contexts to deconstruct the type family and obtain the original argument type.&lt;ref name="FunWithTypeFunctions" /&gt;

== Motivation and examples ==
Type families are useful in abstracting patterns where a common "organization" or "structure" of types is repeated, but with different specific types in each case. Typical use cases include describing [[abstract data type]]s like generic collections, or [[design pattern]]s like [[model–view–controller]].

=== Self-optimizing abstract data types ===
One of the original motivations for the introduction of associated types was to allow [[abstract data type]]s to be [[parameterized type|parameterized]] by their content type such that the [[data structure]] implementing the abstract type varies in a "self-optimizing" way.&lt;ref name="AssociatedTypesWithClass" /&gt; Normal [[algebraic data type]] parameters can only describe data structures that behave uniformly with respect to all argument types. Associated types, however, can describe a family of data structures that have a uniform interface but vary in implementation according to one or more type parameters. For example,&lt;ref name="AssociatedTypesWithClass" /&gt; using Haskell's associated types notation, we can declare a type class of valid [[Array data type|array]] element types, with an associated data family representing an array of that element type:
&lt;source lang="haskell"&gt;
class ArrayElem e where
    data Array e
    index :: Array e -&gt; Int -&gt; e
&lt;/source&gt;
Instances can then be defined for this class, which define both the data structure used and the operations on the data structure in a single location. For efficiency, we might use a packed [[bit vector]] representation for arrays of [[Boolean data type|Boolean]] values, while using a normal [[array data structure]] for integer values. The data structure for arrays of [[ordered pair]]s is defined recursively as a pair of arrays of each of the element types.
&lt;source lang="haskell"&gt;
instance ArrayElem Bool where
    data Array Bool = BoolArray BitVector
    index (BoolArray ar) i = indexBitVector ar i
instance ArrayElem Int where
    data Array Int = IntArray UIntArr
    index (IntArray ar) i = indexUIntArr ar i
instance (ArrayElem a, ArrayElem b) =&gt; ArrayElem (a, b) where
    data Array (a, b) = PairArray (Array a) (Array b)
    index (PairArray ar br) = (index ar i, index br i)
&lt;/source&gt;
With these definitions, when a client refers to an &lt;code&gt;Array (Int, Bool)&lt;/code&gt;, an implementation is automatically selected using the defined instances.

=== A class for collections ===
Inverting the previous example, we can also use type families to define a class for collection types, where the type function maps each collection type to its corresponding element type:&lt;ref name="AssociatedTypeSynonyms" /&gt;
&lt;source lang="haskell"&gt;
class Collects c where
    type Elem c
    empty :: c
    insert :: Elem c -&gt; c -&gt; c
    toList :: c -&gt; [Elem c]
instance Collects [e] where
    type Elem [e] = e
    empty = []
    insert = (:)
    toList = id
instance Ord e =&gt; Collects (Set.Set e) where
    type Elem (Set.Set e) = e
    empty = Set.empty
    insert = Set.insert
    toList = Set.toList
&lt;/source&gt;
In this example, the use of a type synonym family instead of a data family is essential, since multiple collection types may have the same element type.

== Comparison with functional dependencies ==
[[Type class#Functional dependencies|Functional dependencies]] are another type system feature that have similar uses to associated types. While an associated type adds a named type function mapping the enclosing type class's parameters to another type, a functional dependency lists the result type as another parameter of the type class and adds a constraint between the type parameters (e.g. "parameter ''a'' uniquely determines parameter ''b''", written &lt;code&gt;a -&amp;gt; b&lt;/code&gt;). The most common uses of functional dependencies can be directly converted to associated types and vice versa.&lt;ref name="AssociatedTypeSynonyms" /&gt;

Type families are regarded as being generally easier to type-check than functional dependencies. Another advantage of associated types over functional dependencies is that the latter requires clients using the type class to state all of the dependent types in their contexts, including ones they do not use; since associated types do not require this, adding another associated type to the class requires updating only the class's instances, while clients can remain unchanged. The main advantages of functional dependencies over type families are in their added flexibility in handling a few unusual cases.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Type Families (TF) vs Functional Dependencies (FD)|url=http://hackage.haskell.org/trac/ghc/wiki/TFvsFD|accessdate=23 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Under2 Coalition''' is a coalition of subnational governments that aims to achieve [[Climate change mitigation|greenhouse gases emissions mitigation]]. It started as a [[memorandum of understanding]], which was signed by twelve founding jurisdictions on May 19, 2015 in [[Sacramento, California]].&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.sacbee.com/news/politics-government/capitol-alert/article21407862.html |title=Jerry Brown signs non-binding climate pact with other leaders|newspaper=sacbee|access-date=2016-12-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although it was originally called the '''Under2 MOU''', it became known as the '''Under2 Coalition''' in 2017. As of September 2018, the list of signatories has grown to over 220 jurisdictions which combined encompasses 1.3 billion people and 43% of the [[world economy]].&lt;ref name=coalition&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.under2coalition.org/news/biggest-ever-gathering-global-states-and-regions-climate-action|title=Under2 Coalition|newspaper=Under2 Coalition |access-date=2018-10-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The Under2 MOU was conceived through a partnership between the governments of [[California]] and [[Baden-Württemberg|Baden-Wurttemberg]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://prospect.org/article/california-champions-cross-border-climate-innovations |title=California Champions Cross-Border Climate Innovations|newspaper=The American Prospect|access-date=2016-12-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; with [[The Climate Group]] acting as secretariat.&lt;ref name="The Climate Group"&gt;{{Cite news |title=Under2 Coalition |url=https://www.theclimategroup.org/project/under2-coalition|newspaper=The Climate Group|access-date=2017-07-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Purpose and intent==
The intent of the memorandum signatories is for each to achieve [[Greenhouse gas]] "emission reductions consistent with a trajectory of 80 to 95 percent below 1990 levels by 2050 and/or achieving a per capita annual emission goal of less than 2 metric tons by 2050.&lt;ref name="MOU"&gt; [http://under2mou.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Under2-MOU-English.pdf Under2 MOU, "Global Climate Leadership Memorandum Of Understanding"], section II.A.&lt;/ref&gt; The signatories believe these actions are consistent with findings of the [[Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change]] (IPCC) of what is necessary to avoid a 2 degree Celsius rise in average global temperatures.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.upi.com/Business_News/Energy-Industry/2015/07/02/California-driving-global-low-carbon-effort/5581435831547/ |title=California driving global low-carbon effort|newspaper=UPI|access-date=2016-12-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |title=Climate Panel Cites Near Certainty on Warming|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/08/20/science/earth/extremely-likely-that-human-activity-is-driving-climate-change-panel-finds.html|last=Gillis|first=Justin|date=2013-08-19|newspaper=The New York Times|issn=0362-4331|access-date=2016-12-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="MOU"/&gt; Organizers are concerned that a rise in global temperature above 2 degrees Celsius would cause widespread environmental harm.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Signatories to the memorandum are asked to submit a plan to meet the target reduction of green house gas emissions by 2 metric tons per capita by 2050.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Each of the governments also pledges to assist each other with scientific research, sharing of the available technologies and best practices in energy efficiency.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Wright|first=David|year=2016|title=Cross-Border Constraints on Climate Change Agreements: Legal Risks in the California-Quebec Cap-and-Trade Linkage|url=|journal=Environmental Law Reporter|volume=46|pages=10478–10495|via=Fusion}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The memorandum was developed just before the [[2015 United Nations Climate Change Conference]] also known as [[2015 United Nations Climate Change Conference|COP 21]] or [[2015 United Nations Climate Change Conference|Paris Agreement]].&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; The Under2 MOU allows subnational governments such as cities, counties and states to highlight their work to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==History==
Subnational governments like cities, states and provinces have traditionally relied on national governments to take the lead on transnational climate governance aimed at addressing climate change mitigation through inter-governmental agreements.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://search.proquest.com/openview/eba672c654472911b7c57372d3d413b0/1?pq-origsite=gscholar&amp;cbl=1586351|title=Common But Differentiated Responsibilities Beyond the Nation State: How Is Differential Treatment Addressed in Transnational Climate Governance Initiatives? - ProQuest|website=search.proquest.com|access-date=2016-12-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some subnational governments have expressed frustration at the inaction of national leaders and took it upon themselves to create the subnational Under2 MOU agreement.&lt;sup&gt;[1]&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Barnosky|first=Anthony D.|last2=Ehrlich|first2=Paul R.|last3=Hadly|first3=Elizabeth A.|date=2016-03-15|title=Avoiding collapse: Grand challenges for science and society to solve by 2050|url=http://assets.elementascience.org/articles/94|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160420225121/http://assets.elementascience.org/articles/94|dead-url=yes|archive-date=2016-04-20|journal=Elementa: Science of the Anthropocene|volume=4|issue=1|doi=10.12952/journal.elementa.000094|issn=2325-1026}}&lt;/ref&gt; The major difference between an international treaty and the Under2 MOU agreement between subnational governments is that the Under2 MOU is non-binding.&lt;sup&gt;[2]&lt;/sup&gt;

In December 2015, [[California]] and [[Baden-Württemberg|Baden-Wurttemberg]], who spearheaded the Under 2 MOU, announced that [[The Climate Group]] would take on the role of secretariat for the pact.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theclimategroup.org/news/baden-wurttemberg-and-california-welcome-43-new-signatories-under-2-mou-initiative|title=Baden-Württemberg and California welcome 43 new signatories to the Under 2 MOU|newspaper=The Climate Group|access-date=2017-07-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There have been efforts in the past to organize subnational governments to address climate change most notably through the [[Cities for Climate Protection program|Cities for Climate Protection Program]] - an effort associated with the International Union of Local Authorities and the [[United Nations Environment Programme]]. At its peak in 2010 the program had 700 municipal members who were required to provide among other things inventories and targets for greenhouse emissions. the International Union of Local Authorities provided technical assistance to the municipalities engaged in this planning.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://blogs.lse.ac.uk/usappblog/2015/08/13/how-us-cities-dropped-climate-protection-commitments-in-response-to-mainstream-political-opposition-and-programmatic-stagnation/|title=How US cities dropped climate protection commitments in response to mainstream political opposition and programmatic stagnation|date=2015-08-13|newspaper=USAPP|language=en-US|access-date=2016-12-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Before the Under2 MOU was conceived many subnational governments had taken the initiative to create a [[List of climate change initiatives|climate action plan]].  The purpose of a climate action plan is to identify the amount of greenhouse gas emissions produced by the jurisdiction and, in many cases, provide strategies to lower or stop greenhouse gas emissions altogether.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Bassett |first=Ellen|last2=Shandas|first2=Vivek|date=2010-09-29|title=Innovation and Climate Action Planning |url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1080/01944363.2010.509703|journal=Journal of the American Planning Association|volume=76|issue=4|pages=435–450 |doi=10.1080/01944363.2010.509703|issn=0194-4363}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Some governments have found that the data produced by the climate action plan increases transparency and helps with longterm planning to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |title=El gobernador de Jalisco da conferencia durante COP22|url=http://www.animalpolitico.com/2016/11/gobernador-jalisco-da-una-conferencia-cop22-soluciones-bajas-emisiones/ |website=www.animalpolitico.com|access-date=2016-12-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since signatories to the Under2 MOU submit their action plans as an appendix to the document this is the first time some cities and states around the world are coming up with plans to reduce greenhouse gas emissions in their jurisdiction.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6210">The '''William James Lectures''' are a series of invited lectureships at [[Harvard University]] sponsored by the Departments of [[Philosophy]] and [[Psychology]], who alternate in the selection of speakers.  The series was created in honor of the American [[Pragmatism|pragmatist]] philosopher and psychologist [[William James]], a former faculty member at that institution. It was endowed through a 1929 bequest from Edgar Pierce, a Harvard Alumnus, who also funded the prestigious Edgar Pierce Chair in Philosophy and Psychology.  Pierce stipulated that the delivered lectures be open to the public and subsequently published by the [[Harvard University Press]].&lt;ref&gt;''Harvard Alumni Bulletin'', ''34'' (22), (Fri. March 4, 1932).&lt;/ref&gt; The program was initiated in 1930 and has continued to the present. Its invited lecturers have included some of the most influential thinkers of the 20th century. In some cases, the selection of lecturer has generated considerable controversy.&lt;ref&gt;Monk, R. (2001).  ''Bertrand Russell: The ghost of madness, 1921–1970.''

==Chronological list of invited lectureships==
{{Expand list|date=April 2017}}
:This compilation is based on a mimeographed list found in the clippings file at the Harvard Library Archives.  The mimeographed list only covered the lectures delivered through 1971.  The remaining items were supplied by searching for relevant monographs in the catalogs of the Harvard Library and the Library of Congress; one further lecture was sourced as noted in the following footnote.  Since not all of the lecture series resulted in a published book, the list may be incomplete.
