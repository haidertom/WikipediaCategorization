[[Image:Graham's_Hierarchy_of_Disagreement-en.svg|thumb|right|375px|[[Paul Graham (computer programmer)|Paul Graham]]'s Hierarchy of Disagreement lists ad hominem as the second lowest type of argument in a disagreement.]]

However, its original meaning was an argument "calculated to appeal to the person addressed more than to impartial reason".&lt;ref&gt;Fowler, H. W. (1926), ''A Dictionary of Modern English Usage'' (under ''Technical Terms'')&lt;/ref&gt;

Fallacious ''ad hominem'' reasoning is categorized  among [[informal fallacy|informal fallacies]],&lt;ref name="one"&gt;{{cite book |author=[[Doug Walton|Walton, Douglas]] |title=Informal Logic: A Pragmatic Approach |year=2008 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |page=190}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Bowell|first1=Tracy|last2=Kemp|first2=Gary|title=Critical Thinking: A Concise Guide|year=2010|publisher=Routledge|location=Abingdon, Oxon|isbn=0-415-47183-4|pages=210–213}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Irving M.|last=Copi|title=Informal Logic|isbn=0-02-324940-4|publisher=Macmillan|year=1986|pages=112–113}}&lt;/ref&gt; more precisely as a [[genetic fallacy]], a subcategory of [[fallacies of irrelevance]].

== Types ==
{{See also|List of fallacies}}

===''Tu quoque''===
{{Main|Tu quoque}}
''Ad hominem tu quoque'' (literally: "You also") refers to a claim that the source making the argument has spoken or acted in a way inconsistent with the argument. In particular, if Source A criticizes the actions of Source B, a ''tu quoque'' response is that Source A has acted in the same way. This argument is invalid because it does not disprove the premise; if the premise is true then Source A may be a [[hypocrite]], but this does not make the statement less credible from a logical perspective. Indeed, Source A may be in a position to provide personal testimony to support the argument.

For example, a father may tell his son not to start smoking as he will regret it when he is older, and the son may point out that his father is or was a smoker. This does not alter the fact that his son may regret smoking when he is older.

===Circumstantial===
{{Main|Bulverism}}
''Circumstantial ad hominem'' points out that someone is in circumstances such that they are disposed to take a particular position. It constitutes an attack on the bias of a source. This is fallacious because a disposition to make a certain argument does not make the argument invalid; this overlaps with the [[genetic fallacy]] (an argument that a claim is incorrect due to its source).&lt;ref name="Walton (1998) p18-21"&gt;{{cite book |last=Walton |first=Douglas |title=Ad Hominem Arguments |publisher=University of Alabama Press |year=1998 |isbn=0-8173-0922-5 |pages=18–21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The circumstantial fallacy does not apply where the source is taking a position by using a logical argument based solely on premises that are generally accepted. Where the source seeks to convince an audience of the truth of a premise by a claim of authority or by personal observation, observation of their circumstances may reduce the evidentiary weight of the claims, sometimes to zero.&lt;ref name="Fallacy Files"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.fallacyfiles.org/adhomine.html |title=Argumentum ad Hominem |accessdate=2007-09-10 |work=Fallacy Files |last=Curtis |first=Gary N.| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20070920193815/http://www.fallacyfiles.org/adhomine.html| archivedate= 20 September 2007 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Examples''':

# [[Mandy Rice-Davies]]'s famous testimony during the [[Profumo Affair]], "He would [say that], wouldn't he?", is an example of a valid circumstantial argument. Her point was that a man in a prominent position, accused of an affair with a [[callgirl]], would deny the claim whether it was true or false.  His denial, in itself, provides little evidence against the claim of an affair.

However, this argument is valid only insofar as it devalues the denial; it does ''not'' strengthen the original claim.  To construe invalid evidence of the denial as valid evidence of the original claim is fallacious (on several different bases, including that of ''argumentum ad hominem'' and ''appeal to emotions''); however likely the man in question would be to deny an affair that did in fact happen, he is even more likely to deny an affair that never happened. (For example, inferring guilt from a denial{{snd}}or, less starkly, excessive devaluation of a denial{{snd}}is a very common feature in [[Conspiracy theory|conspiracy theories]], [[witch-hunt]]s, [[show trials]], [[struggle sessions]], and other coercive circumstances in which the person targeted is presumed guilty.)

# Glassner suggests that Bennett is somehow unqualified to criticize rap music because of positions Bennett has taken on other issues. However wrong Bennett may or may not have been on other issues, that does not mean that his criticisms of rap were mistaken.&lt;ref name="Fallacy Files"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.fallacyfiles.org/adhomine.html |title=Argumentum ad Hominem |accessdate=2007-09-10 |work=Fallacy Files |last=Curtis |first=Gary N.| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20070920193815/http://www.fallacyfiles.org/adhomine.html| archivedate= 20 September 2007 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Guilt by association===
{{Main|Association fallacy}}
Guilt by association can sometimes also be a type of ''ad hominem'' fallacy if the argument attacks a source because of the similarity between the views of someone making an argument and other proponents of the argument.&lt;ref name="Walton (1998) p18-21"/&gt;

This form of the argument is as follows:
# Source S makes claim C.
# Group G, which is currently viewed negatively by the recipient, also makes claim C.
# Therefore, source S is viewed by the recipient of the claim as associated to the group G and inherits how negatively viewed it is.

An example of this fallacy could be "My opponent for office just received an endorsement from the Puppy Haters Association. Is that the sort of person you would want to vote for?"

== Non-fallacious reasoning ==
When a statement is challenged by making an ''ad hominem'' attack on its author, it is important to draw a distinction between whether the statement in question was ''an argument'' or ''a statement of fact'' (''testimony''). In the latter case the issues of the credibility of the person making the statement may be crucial.&lt;ref name="Fallacy Files"/&gt;

== Criticism as a fallacy ==

[[Doug Walton]],  Canadian academic and author, has argued that ''ad hominem'' reasoning is not always fallacious, and that in some instances, questions of personal conduct, character, motives, etc., are legitimate and relevant to the issue,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Walton, Douglas |title=Informal Logic: A Pragmatic Approach |year=2008 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |page=170}}&lt;/ref&gt; as when it directly involves hypocrisy, or actions contradicting the subject's words.

The philosopher [[Charles Taylor (philosopher)|Charles Taylor]] has argued that ''ad hominem'' reasoning (discussing facts about the speaker or author relative to the value of his statements) is essential to understanding certain moral issues due to the connection between individual persons and morality (or moral claims), and contrasts this sort of reasoning with the [[apodicticity|apodictic]] reasoning (involving facts beyond dispute or clearly established) of philosophical naturalism.&lt;ref name=Taylor&gt;{{cite book |authorlink=Charles Taylor (philosopher) |last=Taylor |first=Charles |title=Philosophical Arguments |year=1995 |publisher=Harvard University Press |isbn=9780674664760 |pages=34–60 |url=https://books.google.com.mx/books?id=iqtLAsIBZ2sC&amp;pg=PA34&amp;lpg=PA34&amp;dq=explanation+and+practical+reason+charles+taylor&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=NULkg3WL_-&amp;sig=BaEwQ_OXdRBysmVeQVkM4uKJ2s8&amp;hl=es&amp;sa=X&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |chapter=Explanation and Practical Reason}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Anthropology|social/cultural}}
'''Anthropology of religion''' is the study of religion in relation to other social [[institution]]s, and the comparison of [[religious belief]]s and [[Ritual#Religious rituals|practices]] across [[culture]]s.{{sfnm |1a1=Adams |1y=2017 |2a1=Eller |2y=2007 |2p=2}}

==History==
In the early 11th century, [[Abū Rayhān Bīrūnī]] (973–1048), wrote detailed comparative studies on the anthropology of religions and cultures across the [[Middle East]], [[Mediterranean Basin|Mediterranean]] and the [[Indian subcontinent]].{{sfn|Walbridge|1998}} He discussed the peoples, customs, and religions of the [[Indian subcontinent]].

[[Anthropology]] circa 1940 assumed that religion is in complete continuity with [[magical thinking]],{{efn|In 1944, [[Ernst Cassirer]] wrote: {{quote|It seems to be one of the postulates of modern anthropology that there is complete continuity between magic and religion. [note 35: See, for instance, RR Marett, Faith, Hope, and Charity in Primitive Religion, the Gifford Lectures (Macmillan, 1932), Lecture II, pp. 21 ff.] ... We have no empirical evidence at all that there ever was an age of magic that has been followed and superseded by an age of religion.{{sfn|Cassirer|2006|pp=122–123}}}}}}{{sfn|Cassirer|2006|pp=122–123}}{{Dubious |Problems with many claims |reason=Citation does not say anything about modern anthropology and is not a work on the issue |date=April 2015}} and that it is a cultural product.{{efn|T. M. Manickam wrote: {{quote|Religious anthropology suggests that every religion is a product of the cultural evolution, more or less coherent, of one race or people; and this cultural product is further enriched by its interaction and cross-fertilization with other peoples and their cultures, in whose vicinity the former originated and evolved.{{sfn|Manickam|1977|p=6}}}}}}{{sfn|Manickam|1977|p=6}} The complete continuity between [[magic and religion]] has been a postulate of modern anthropology at least since early 1930s.{{efn|[[Robert Ranulph Marett|R. R. Marett]] wrote: {{quote|In conclusion, a word must be said on a rather trite subject. Many leading anthropologists, including the author of ''The Golden Bough'', would wholly or in the main refuse the title of religion to these almost inarticulate ceremonies of very humble folk. I am afraid, however, that I cannot follow them. Nay, I would not leave out a whole continent from a survey of the religions of mankind in order to humour the most distinguished of my friends. Now clearly if these observances are not to be regarded as religious, like a wedding in church, so neither can they be classed as civil, like its drab equivalent at a registry office. They are mysteries, and are therefore at least generically akin to religion. Moreover, they are held in the highest public esteem as of infinite worth whether in themselves or for their effects. To label them, then, with the opprobrious name of magic as if they were on a par with the mummeries that enable certain knaves to batten on the nerves of fools is quite unscientific; for it mixes up two things which the student of human culture must keep rigidly apart, namely, a normal development of the social life and one of its morbid by-products. Hence for me they belong to religion, but of course to rudimentary religion—to an early phase of the same world-wide institution that we know by that name among ourselves. I am bound to postulate the strictest continuity between these stages of what I have here undertaken to interpret as a natural growth.{{sfn|Marett|1932}}}}}}{{sfnm |1a1=Cassirer |1y=2006 |1pp=122–123 |2a1=Marett |2y=1932}} The perspective of modern anthropology towards religion is the ''[[Psychological projection|projection]] idea'', a methodological approach which assumes that every religion is created by the human [[community]] that worships it, that "creative activity ascribed to God is projected from man."{{sfnm |1a1=Guthrie |1y=2000 |1pp=225–226 |2a1=Harvey |2y=1996 |2p=67 |3a1=Pandian |3y=1997 |p=507}} In 1841, [[Ludwig Feuerbach]] was the first to employ this concept as the basis for a systematic critique of religion.{{sfnm |1a1=Feuerbach |1y=1841 |2a1=Harvey |2y=1995 |2p=4 |3a1=Mackey |3y=2000 |pages=41–42 |4a1=Nelson |4y=1990}} A prominent precursor in the formulation of this projection principle was [[Giambattista Vico]],{{sfnm |1a1=Cotrupi |1y=2000 |1p=21 |2a1=Harvey |2y=1995 |2p=4}} and an early formulation of it is found in ancient Greek writer [[Xenophanes]], which observed that "the gods of Ethiopians were inevitably black with flat noses while those of the Thracians were blond with blue eyes."{{sfn|Harvey|1995|p=4}}

In 1912 [[Émile Durkheim]], building on Feuerbach, considered religion "a projection of the social values of society," "a means of making [[symbol]]ic statements about society," "a symbolic language that makes statements about the social order";{{sfnm |1a1=Durkheim |1y=1912 |2a1=Bowie |2y=1999 |2pp=15, 143}} in short, "religion is society worshiping itself".{{sfn|Nelson|1990}}&lt;ref&gt;Durkheim, p.266 in the 1963 edition&lt;/ref&gt;{{incomplete short citation|date=November 2017}}

In the 19th century, [[cultural anthropology]] was dominated by an interest in [[cultural evolution]]; most anthropologists assumed that there was a simple distinction between "primitive" and "modern" religion and tried to provide accounts of how the former evolved into the latter.{{citation needed|date=April 2015}} In the 20th century most anthropologists rejected this approach.  Today the anthropology of religion reflects the influence of, or an engagement with, such theorists as [[Karl Marx]], [[Sigmund Freud]], Émile Durkheim, and [[Max Weber]].{{sfnm |1a1=Eller |1y=2007 |1p=22 |2a1=Weber |2y=2002}} They are especially concerned with how religious beliefs and practices may reflect political or economic forces; or the social functions of religious beliefs and practices.{{sfn|Eller|2007|p=4}}{{clarify|date=April 2015}}

== Definition of religion==
One major problem in the anthropology of religion is the definition of religion itself.{{sfn|Eller|2007|p=7}} At one time{{vague|date=April 2015}} anthropologists believed that certain religious practices and beliefs were more or less universal to all cultures at some point in their development, such as a belief in spirits or [[ghost]]s, the use of [[magic (religion)|magic]] as a means of controlling the [[supernatural]], the use of [[divination]] as a means of discovering occult knowledge, and the performance of [[ritual]]s such as [[prayer]] and [[sacrifice]] as a means of influencing the outcome of various events through a supernatural agency, sometimes taking the form of [[shamanism]] or [[ancestor worship]].{{citation needed|date=April 2015}} According to [[Clifford Geertz]], religion is
{{quote|(1) a system of symbols which acts to (2) establish powerful, pervasive, and long-lasting moods and motivations in men by (3) formulating conceptions of a general order of existence and (4) clothing these conceptions with such an aura of factuality that (5) the moods and motivations seem uniquely realistic."{{sfn|Geertz|1966|p=4}}}}

Today, religious anthropologists debate, and reject, the cross-cultural validity of these categories (often viewing them as examples of European [[primitivism]]).{{citation needed|date=April 2015}}  Anthropologists have considered various criteria for defining religion &amp;ndash; such as a belief in the supernatural or the reliance on ritual &amp;ndash; but few claim that these criteria are universally valid.{{sfn|Eller|2007|p=7}}

[[Anthony F. C. Wallace]] proposes four categories of religion, each subsequent category subsuming the previous. These are, however, synthetic categories and do not necessarily encompass all religions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Rathman |first=Jessica |title=Anthony Francis Clarke Wallace |url=http://www.mnsu.edu/emuseum/information/biography/uvwxyz/wallace_anthony.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20030927142508/http://www.mnsu.edu/emuseum/information/biography/uvwxyz/wallace_anthony.html |archive-date=27 November 2003 |access-date=22 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

# Individualistic: most basic; simplest. Example: [[vision quest]].
# Shamanistic: part-time religious practitioner, uses religion to heal, to divine, usually on the behalf of a client. The [[Tillamook (tribe)|Tillamook]] have four categories of shaman. Examples of shamans: spiritualists, faith healers, palm readers. Religious authority acquired through one's own means.
# Communal: elaborate set of beliefs and practices; group of people arranged in clans by lineage, age group, or some religious societies; people take on roles based on knowledge, and ancestral worship.
# Ecclesiastical: dominant in agricultural societies and states; are centrally organized and hierarchical in structure, paralleling the organization of states. Typically deprecates competing individualistic and shamanistic cults.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12988">'''Antireductionism''' is the position in [[science]] and [[metaphysics]] that stands in contrast to [[reductionism]] (anti-holism) by advocating that not all properties of a system can be explained in terms of its constituent parts and their interactions. E.g. it is a  fact of classical reductionistic physics--that the electromagnetic potential exists as a continuum . The opposite of reductionism is [[holism]], that understanding a system can be done only as a whole. One form of antireductionism (epistemological) holds that we simply are not capable of understanding systems at the level of their most basic constituents, and so the program of reductionism must fail. The other kind of antireductionism (ontological) holds that such a complete explanation in terms of basic constituents is not possible even in principle for some systems.&lt;ref name=Nagel/&gt; Robert Laughlin, e.g. supports this view.&lt;ref name=Laughlin/&gt; Disciplines such as cybernetics and systems theory embrace a non-reductionist view of science, sometimes going as far as explaining phenomena at a given level of hierarchy in terms of phenomena at a higher level, in a sense, the opposite of a reductionist approach.

Although breaking complex phenomena into parts is a key method in science, there are those complex phenomena (e.g. in [[physics]], [[psychology]], [[sociology]], [[ecology]]) where the approach does not work. Antireductionism also arises in academic fields such as [[history]], [[economics]], [[anthropology]], [[medicine]], and [[biology]] as dissatisfaction with attempts to explain complex phenomena using simplistic, ill-fitting models,  which do not provide much insight.

An example of antireductionism in psychology is Davidson's proposed [[ontology]] of what he calls 'events' and its use "to provide an antireductionist answer to the mind/matter debate ...[and to show that]...the impossibility of intertranslating the two [[idioms]] by means of psychophysical laws blocks any analytically reductive relation between...the mental and the physical".&lt;ref name=Davidson/&gt;

[[Karl Popper]] was a famous proponent of antireductionism. In his book ''Of clouds and clocks'', Popper classified phenomena into two types: "clock" phenomena with a mechanical basis and "cloud" phenomena which are indivisible and depend upon [[emergence]] for explanation.&lt;ref name=Popper/&gt;

For example, Popper thought that a materialist explanation of consciousness is not possible.&lt;ref name=Rae/&gt; The view of [[Reductionism|reductionists]] about consciousness is explained by Velmans:&lt;ref name=Velmans/&gt;
:"Most reductionists accept that consciousness ''seems'' to be different from brain states (or functions) but claim that science will ''discover'' it to be nothing more than a state or function of the brain. In short, they mostly accept that brains states and conscious states are ''conceivably'' different, but deny that they are ''actually'' different (in the universe we happen to inhabit)."
::—Max Velmans; ''Understanding consciousness'', Note 26, page 262

Velmans himself is not in agreement with this reductionist stance. Opposition to this ''mind = brain'' reductionism is found in many authors.&lt;ref name=Thompson/&gt;&lt;ref name=Nagel2/&gt;&lt;ref name=Northoff/&gt; An often mentioned issue is that science cannot explain the [[hard problem of consciousness]], the subjective feelings called [[qualia]]. However, a more telling objection is that science is not a self-contained entity, because the theories it uses are creations of the human mind, not inevitable results of experiment and observation, and the criteria for adoption of a particular theory are not definitive in selecting between alternatives, but require subjective input.&lt;ref name=Kuhn/&gt;&lt;ref name=Bird/&gt;&lt;ref name=Bird2/&gt; Even the claim that science is based upon testability of its theories has been met with qualifications.&lt;ref name=Thornton/&gt;&lt;ref name=Lakatos/&gt;

According to Alex Rosenberg and David Kaplan, the conflict between [[physicalism]] and antireductionism can be resolved, that "both reductionists and antireductionists accept that given our [[cognitive]] interests and limitations, non-molecular explanations may not be improved, corrected or grounded in molecular ones".&lt;ref name=Rosenberg/&gt; However, others find that the conflict between reductionism and antireductionism is "one of the central problems in the philosophy of psychology...an updated version of the old mind-body problem: how levels of theories in the behavioral and brain sciences relate to one another. Many contemporary philosophers of mind believe that cognitive-psychological theories are not reducible to neurological theories...most nonreductive [[physicalist]]s prefer the idea of a one-way dependence of the mental on the physical."&lt;ref name=Bickle/&gt;

'''Atmospheric dispersion modeling''' is the [[computer simulation|mathematical simulation]] of how [[Air pollution|air pollutants]] disperse in the ambient [[Earth's atmosphere|atmosphere]]. It is performed with computer programs that include [[algorithm]]s to solve the mathematical equations that govern the pollutant dispersion. The [[Air pollution dispersion terminology|dispersion models]] are used to estimate the downwind ambient [[concentration]] of air pollutants or toxins emitted from sources such as industrial plants, vehicular traffic or accidental chemical releases. They can also be used to predict future concentrations under specific scenarios (i.e. changes in emission sources). Therefore, they are the dominant type of model used in air quality policy making. They are most useful for pollutants that are dispersed over large distances and that may react in the atmosphere. For pollutants that have a very high spatio-temporal variability (i.e. have very steep distance to source decay such as [[black carbon]]) and for [[Epidemiology|epidemiological]] studies statistical land-use regression models are also used.

Dispersion models are important to governmental agencies tasked with protecting and managing the ambient [[air quality]]. The models are typically employed to determine whether existing or proposed new industrial facilities are or will be in compliance with the [[National Ambient Air Quality Standards]] (NAAQS) in the [[United States]] and other nations. The models also serve to assist in the design of effective control strategies to reduce [[Emission standards|emissions]] of harmful air pollutants. During the late 1960s, the Air Pollution Control Office of the U.S. EPA initiated research projects that would lead to the development of models for the use by urban and transportation planners.&lt;ref&gt;Fensterstock, J.C. et al., [http://pubs.awma.org/gsearch/journal/1971/7/21_07_395.pdf "Reduction of air pollution potential through environmental planning"]{{dead link|date=October 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}, JAPCA, Vol.21, No.7, 1971.&lt;/ref&gt; A major and significant application of a roadway dispersion model that resulted from such research was applied to the [[Spadina Expressway]] of Canada in 1971.

Air dispersion models are also used by public safety responders and emergency management personnel for emergency planning of accidental chemical releases. Models are used to determine the consequences of accidental releases of hazardous or toxic materials, Accidental releases may result in fires, spills or explosions that involve hazardous materials, such as chemicals or radionuclides. The results of dispersion modeling, using worst case [[accidental release source terms]] and meteorological conditions, can provide an estimate of location impacted areas, ambient concentrations, and be used to determine protective actions appropriate in the event a release occurs. Appropriate protective actions may include evacuation or [[shelter in place]] for persons in the downwind direction. At industrial facilities, this type of consequence assessment or emergency planning is required under the [[Clean Air Act (United States)]] (CAA) codified in Part 68 of Title 40 of the [[Code of Federal Regulations]].

The dispersion models vary depending on the mathematics used to develop the model, but all require the input of data that may include:
* [[Meteorology|Meteorological]] conditions such as wind speed and direction, the amount of atmospheric [[turbulence]] (as characterized by what is called the [[Air pollution dispersion terminology#Characterization of atmospheric turbulence|"stability class"]]), the ambient air temperature, the height to the bottom of any [[Temperature inversion|inversion]] aloft that may be present, cloud cover and solar radiation.
* Source term (the concentration or quantity of toxins in emission or [[accidental release source terms]]) and temperature of the material
* Emissions or release parameters such as source location and height, type of source (i.e., fire, pool or vent stack)and exit [[velocity]], exit temperature and [[mass flow rate]] or release rate.
* Terrain elevations at the source location and at the receptor location(s), such as nearby homes, schools, businesses and hospitals.
* The location, height and width of any obstructions (such as buildings or other structures) in the path of the emitted gaseous plume, surface roughness or the use of a more generic parameter "rural" or "city" terrain.

Many of the modern, advanced dispersion modeling programs include a [[Preprocessor (CAE)|pre-processor]] module for the input of meteorological and other data, and many also include a post-processor module for graphing the output data and/or [[Plot (graphics)|plotting]] the area impacted by the air pollutants on maps. The plots of areas impacted may also include [[isopleths]] showing areas of minimal to high concentrations that define areas of the highest health risk. The isopleths plots are useful in determining protective actions for the public and responders.

The atmospheric dispersion models are also known as atmospheric diffusion models, air dispersion models, air quality models, and air pollution dispersion models.

==Atmospheric layers==

Discussion of the layers in the [[Earth's atmosphere]] is needed to understand where airborne pollutants disperse in the atmosphere. The layer closest to the Earth's surface is known as the ''[[Earth's atmosphere|troposphere]]''. It extends from sea-level to a height of about 18&amp;nbsp;km and contains about 80 percent of the mass of the overall atmosphere. The ''[[Earth's atmosphere|stratosphere]]'' is the next layer and extends from 18&amp;nbsp;km to about 50&amp;nbsp;km. The third layer is the ''[[Earth's atmosphere|mesosphere]]'' which extends from 50&amp;nbsp;km to about 80&amp;nbsp;km. There are other layers above 80&amp;nbsp;km, but they are insignificant with respect to atmospheric dispersion modeling.

The lowest part of the troposphere is called the ''[[Planetary boundary layer|atmospheric boundary layer (ABL)]]'' or the ''[[Planetary boundary layer|planetary boundary layer (PBL)]]'' . The air temperature of the atmosphere decreases with increasing altitude until it reaches what is called a ''[[Capping inversion|inversion layer]]'' (where the temperature increases with increasing altitude) that caps the [[Convective Boundary Layer]], typically to about 1.5 to 2.0&amp;nbsp;km in height. The upper part of the troposphere (i.e., above the inversion layer) is called the ''free troposphere'' and it extends up to the [[tropopause]] (the boundary in the Earth's atmosphere between the troposphere and the stratosphere). In tropical and mid-latitudes during daytime, the [[Free convective layer]] can comprises the entire troposphere, which is up to 10 km to 18 km in the [[Intertropical convergence zone]].

The ABL is of the most important with respect to the emission, transport and dispersion of airborne pollutants. The part of the ABL between the Earth's surface and the bottom of the inversion layer is known as the mixing layer. Almost all of the airborne pollutants emitted into the ambient atmosphere are transported and dispersed within the mixing layer. Some of the emissions penetrate the inversion layer and enter the free troposphere above the ABL.

In summary, the layers of the Earth's atmosphere from the surface of the ground upwards are: the ABL made up of the mixing layer capped by the inversion layer; the free troposphere; the stratosphere; the mesosphere and others. Many atmospheric dispersion models are referred to as ''boundary layer models'' because they mainly model air pollutant dispersion within the ABL. To avoid confusion, models referred to as ''mesoscale models'' have dispersion modeling capabilities that extend horizontally up to a few hundred kilometres. It does not mean that they model dispersion in the mesosphere.

==Gaussian air pollutant dispersion equation==

The technical literature on air pollution dispersion is quite extensive and dates back to the 1930s and earlier. One of the early air pollutant plume dispersion equations was derived by Bosanquet and Pearson.&lt;ref&gt;Bosanquet, C.H. and Pearson, J.L., "The spread of smoke and gases from chimneys", Trans. Faraday Soc., 32:1249, 1936&lt;/ref&gt; Their equation did not assume [[Normal distribution|Gaussian distribution]] nor did it include the effect of ground reflection of the pollutant plume.

Sir Graham Sutton derived an air pollutant plume dispersion equation in 1947&lt;ref&gt;Sutton, O.G., "The problem of diffusion in the lower atmosphere", QJRMS, 73:257, 1947 and "The theoretical distribution of airborne pollution from factory chimneys", QJRMS, 73:426, 1947&lt;/ref&gt; which did include the assumption of Gaussian distribution for the vertical and crosswind dispersion of the plume and also included the effect of ground reflection of the plume.

Under the stimulus provided by the advent of stringent [[Clean Air Act (United States)|environmental control regulations]], there was an immense growth in the use of air pollutant plume dispersion calculations between the late 1960s and today. A great many computer programs for calculating the dispersion of air pollutant emissions were developed during that period of time and they were called "air dispersion models". The basis for most of those models was the '''Complete Equation For Gaussian Dispersion Modeling Of [[Air pollution dispersion terminology|Continuous, Buoyant Air Pollution Plumes]]''' shown below:&lt;ref name=Beychok&gt;{{cite book|author=Beychok, Milton R.|title=[[Fundamentals Of Stack Gas Dispersion]]|edition=4th|publisher=author-published|year=2005|isbn=0-9644588-0-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Turner, D.B.|title=Workbook of atmospheric dispersion estimates: an introduction to dispersion modeling| edition=2nd|publisher=CRC Press|year=1994|isbn=1-56670-023-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The above equation not only includes upward reflection from the ground, it also includes downward reflection from the bottom of any inversion lid present in the atmosphere.

The sum of the four exponential terms in &lt;math&gt;g_3&lt;/math&gt; converges to a final value quite rapidly. For most cases, the summation of the series with ''m'' = 1, ''m'' = 2 and ''m'' = 3 will provide an adequate solution.

&lt;math&gt;\sigma_z&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\sigma_y&lt;/math&gt; are functions of the atmospheric stability class (i.e., a measure of the turbulence in the ambient atmosphere) and of the downwind distance to the receptor. The two most important variables affecting the degree of pollutant emission dispersion obtained are the height of the emission source point and the degree of atmospheric turbulence. The more turbulence, the better the degree of dispersion.

The classification of stability class is proposed by F. Pasquill.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=W|first1=Klug|title=Atmospheric Diffusion (3rd Edition). F. Pasquill and F. B. Smith. Ellis Horwood, (John Wiley &amp; Sons) Chichester, 1983|date=April 1984|publisher=Quarterly Journal of the Royal Meteorological Society|location=New York|edition=3rd}}&lt;/ref&gt; The six stability classes are referred to:
A-extremely unstable
B-moderately unstable
C-slightly unstable
D-neutral
E-slightly stable
F-moderately stable

The resulting calculations for [[air pollutant concentrations]] are often expressed as an [[air pollutant]] concentration [[contour line|contour map]] in order to show the spatial variation in contaminant levels over a wide area under study.  In this way the contour lines can overlay sensitive receptor locations and reveal the spatial relationship of air pollutants to areas of interest.

Whereas older models rely on stability classes (see [[air pollution dispersion terminology]]) for the determination of &lt;math&gt;\sigma_y&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\sigma_z&lt;/math&gt;, more recent models increasingly rely on the [[Monin-Obukhov length|Monin-Obukhov similarity theory]] to derive these parameters.

==Briggs plume rise equations==

The Gaussian air pollutant dispersion equation (discussed above) requires the input of ''H'' which is the pollutant plume's centerline height above ground level—and H
is the sum of ''H''&lt;sub&gt;s&lt;/sub&gt; (the actual physical height of the pollutant plume's emission source point) plus Δ''H'' (the plume rise due the plume's buoyancy).

[[File:Gaussian Plume (SVG).svg|thumb|right|333px|Visualization of a buoyant Gaussian air pollutant dispersion plume]]

To determine Δ''H'', many if not most of the air dispersion models developed between the late 1960s and the early 2000s used what are known as "the Briggs equations." G.A. Briggs first published his plume rise observations and comparisons in 1965.&lt;ref&gt;Briggs, G.A., "A plume rise model compared with observations", JAPCA, 15:433–438, 1965&lt;/ref&gt; In 1968, at a symposium sponsored by CONCAWE (a Dutch organization), he compared many of the plume rise models then available in the literature.&lt;ref&gt;Briggs, G.A., "CONCAWE meeting: discussion of the comparative consequences of different plume rise formulas", Atmos. Envir., 2:228–232, 1968&lt;/ref&gt; In that same year, Briggs also wrote the section of the publication edited by Slade&lt;ref&gt;Slade, D.H. (editor), "Meteorology and atomic energy 1968", Air Resources Laboratory, U.S. Dept. of Commerce, 1968&lt;/ref&gt; dealing with the comparative analyses of plume rise models.  That was followed in 1969 by his classical critical review of the entire plume rise literature,&lt;ref&gt;Briggs, G.A., "Plume Rise", USAEC Critical Review Series, 1969&lt;/ref&gt; in which he proposed a set of plume rise equations which have become widely known as "the Briggs equations".  Subsequently, Briggs modified his 1969 plume rise equations in 1971 and in 1972.&lt;ref&gt;Briggs, G.A., "Some recent analyses of plume rise observation", Proc. Second Internat'l. Clean Air Congress, Academic Press, New York, 1971&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Briggs, G.A., "Discussion: chimney plumes in neutral and stable surroundings", Atmos. Envir., 6:507–510, 1972&lt;/ref&gt;

Briggs divided air pollution plumes into these four general categories:
* Cold jet plumes in calm ambient air conditions
* Cold jet plumes in windy ambient air conditions
* Hot, buoyant plumes in calm ambient air conditions
* Hot, buoyant plumes in windy ambient air conditions

Briggs considered the trajectory of cold jet plumes to be dominated by their initial velocity momentum, and the trajectory of hot, buoyant plumes to be dominated by their buoyant momentum to the extent that their initial velocity momentum was relatively unimportant.  Although Briggs proposed plume rise equations for each of the above plume categories, '''''it is important to emphasize that "the Briggs equations" which become widely used are those that he proposed for bent-over, hot buoyant plumes'''''.

In general, Briggs's equations for bent-over, hot buoyant plumes are based on observations and data involving plumes from typical combustion sources such as the [[Flue gas|flue gas stacks]] from steam-generating boilers burning [[fossil fuel]]s in large power plants.  Therefore, the stack exit velocities were probably in the range of 20 to 100&amp;nbsp;ft/s (6 to 30&amp;nbsp;m/s) with exit temperatures ranging from 250 to 500&amp;nbsp;°F (120 to 260&amp;nbsp;°C).

A logic diagram for using the Briggs equations&lt;ref name=Beychok/&gt; to obtain the plume rise trajectory of bent-over buoyant plumes is presented below:

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1154">'''Automatism''', in [[toxicology]], refers to a tendency to take a drug over and over again, forgetting each time that one has already taken the dose. This can lead to a cumulative overdose. A particular example is [[barbiturates]] which were once commonly used as [[hypnotic]] (sleep inducing) drugs. Among the current hypnotics, [[benzodiazepines]], especially [[midazolam]] might show marked automatism, possibly through their intrinsic [[anterograde amnesia]] effect. Barbiturates are known to induce [[hyperalgesia]], i.e. aggravation of pain and for sleeplessness due to pain, if barbiturates are used, more pain and more disorientation would follow leading to drug automation and finally a "pseudo"suicide. Such reports dominated the medical literature of 1960s and 1970s; a reason replacing the barbiturates with benzodiazepines when they became available.&lt;ref&gt;Encyclopedia of Family Health, edition 3, from Marshall Cavendish&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Lexicon of Psychiatry, Neurology, and the Neurosciences by Frank J Ayd from Lippincott Williams &amp; Wilkins, 2000

'''''Being Different: An Indian Challenge to Western Universalism''''' is a [[2011 in literature|2011]] book by [[Rajiv Malhotra]], an Indian-American author, philanthropist and public speaker, published by [[HarperCollins]]. The book reverts the gaze of the [[western culture]]s on India, repositioning India from being the observed to the observer, by looking at the West from a [[Dharma|Dharmic]] point of view.

==About the book==
Malhotra intends to give a critique of western culture, by comparing it with Indian culture, as seen from a 'Dharmic point of view.' To accomplish this goal, he postulates a set of characteristics of western culture, and a set of characteristics of Indian culture and religion, characterised as "Dharmic." Malhotra explains that in ''Being Different'',
{{quote|'Dharma' is used to indicate a family of spiritual traditions originating in India which today are manifested as Hinduism, Buddhism, Jainism and Sikhism. I explain that the variety of perspectives and practices of dharma display an underlying integral unity at the metaphysical level.{{sfn|Malhotra|2011|p=3}}}}

Malhotra summarizes his rationale for treating Dharmic traditions as a family, contrasting the family of Dharmic traditions with Abrahamic religions. He constructs their differences from this 'Dharmic perspective,' thereby 'reversing the gaze.'{{sfn|Malhotra|2012|p=371}} Malhotra clarifies that he is not replacing a West-centric view with a Dharma-centric view by proposing the reversal of gaze.{{sfn|Malhotra|2012|p=375}} Malhotra explains that he seeks a dialogue, where the world civilizations are not merely seen from the viewpoint of the West, but the west is also seen from a non-western, c.q. 'dharmic' point of view.{{sfn|Malhotra|2012|p=371}}

Malhotra calls for mutual respect as a higher standard for pluralism than tolerance. Mutual respect does not call for acceptance of beliefs held by others, only to have genuine respect for difference, because, beliefs are not facts.&lt;ref group=web&gt;{{cite news| author =Rajiv Malhotra | title='Tolerance Isn't Good Enough'|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/rajiv-malhotra/hypocrisy-of-tolerance_b_792239.html | work=Huffington Post}}&lt;/ref&gt; Malhotra explains why this gaze from the other side benefits the West,{{sfn|Malhotra|2012|p=373}} explaining that he
{{quote|... hopes to set the terms for a deeper and more informed engagement between dharmic and Western civilizations."{{sfn|Malhotra|2011|p=2}}}}

==Overview==
Malhotra identifies "six distinct and fundamental points of divergence between the dharmic traditions and the West."&lt;ref group=web name="bdcom-synopsis"&gt;[http://beingdifferentbook.com/synopsis/ beingdifferentbook.com, ''Synopsis'']&lt;/ref&gt;  Malhotra argues that understanding these six points of divergence is crucial to recognizing the fallacy of  facile sameness arguments and to understanding senselessness of inculturation efforts.{{citation needed|date=September 2015}} These points of divergence are:&lt;ref group=web name="bdcom-synopsis" /&gt;&lt;ref group=web name="Patheos Book Club" /&gt;
# Approaches to difference
# History-centrism versus inner sciences
# Integral versus synthetic unity
# The nature of chaos and uncertainty
# Translatability vs. Sanskrit
# Western universalism challenged

===Divergence 1: Approaches to difference===
According to Malhotra, there is a pervasive anxiety in the west over personal and cultural differences. Therefore, the west tries to assimilate and convert "all that does not fit its fundamental paradigms."&lt;ref group=web name="bdcom-synopsis" /&gt; According to Malhotra, this anxiety is grounded in schisms which are inherent in the western worldview. In contrast, "Dharmic traditions [...] are historically more comfortable with differences."&lt;ref group=web name="bdcom-synopsis" /&gt;

===Divergence 2: History Centrism versus inner sciences===
According to Malhotra, Dharmic traditions rely on adhyatma-vidya,{{refn|group=note|"Sciences of spirituality,"&lt;ref group=web&gt;[http://www.britannica.com/topic/adhyatmavidya Encyclopædia Britannica, ''Adhyatmavidya'']&lt;/ref&gt; "True, Genuine and Authentic Spiritual Knowledge."&lt;ref group=web&gt;[http://adhyatmavidya.com/ adhyatmavidya.com]&lt;/ref&gt;}} while the [[Abrahamic religions]] rely on God's interventions in human history.&lt;ref group=web&gt;{{cite web| author =Rajiv Malhotra |title=Problematizing God's Interventions In History|url=http://creative.sulekha.com/problematizing-god-s-interventions-in-history_103442_blog}}&lt;/ref&gt; For followers of history-centric (Abrahamic) religions, truth-claims based on history are more significant than the scriptural message itself. History-centric dogma such as original sin and resurrection become critical beliefs and no compromise can be made on their acceptance. This explains the centrality of Nicene creed to all major Christian denominations. Followers of history-centric religions believe that the God revealed His message through a special prophet and that the message is secured in scriptures. This special access to God is available only to these intermediaries or prophets and not to any other human beings.&lt;ref group=web&gt;{{cite web| author =Rajiv Malhotra |title=Problematizing God's Interventions In History|url=http://creative.sulekha.com/problematizing-god-s-interventions-in-history_103442_blog}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Dharma traditions do not hold history central to their faith. Gautama Buddha emphasized that his enlightenment was merely a discovery of a reality that is always there. He was not bringing any new covenants from any God. The history of the Buddha is not necessary for Buddhist principles to work. In fact, Buddha stated that he was neither the first nor the last person to have achieved the state of enlightenment. He also asserted that he was not God nor sent by any God as a prophet, and whatever he discovered was available to every human to discover for himself. This makes Buddhism not History-Centric.

Malhotra explains how history-centrism or lack of it has implications for religious absolutist exclusivity vs. flexible pluralism:
{{quote|Abrahamic religions claim that we can resolve the human condition only by following the lineage of prophets arising from the Middle East. All other teachings and practices are required to be reconciled with this special and peculiar history. By contrast, the dharmic traditions – Hinduism, Buddhism, Jainism and Sikhism -- do not rely on history in the same absolutist and exclusive way. This dharmic flexibility has made fundamental pluralism possible which cannot occur within the constraints of history centrism, at least as understood so far.&lt;ref group=web&gt;{{cite news| author =Rajiv Malhotra |title=Dharma and the new Pope|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/rajiv-malhotra/dharma-and-the-new-pope_b_2755683.html | work=Huffington Post}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===Divergence 3: Integral versus synthetic unity===
Both Western and Dharmic civilizations have cherished unity as an ideal, but with a different emphasis.  Here, Malhotra posits a crucial distinction between what he considers a "synthetic unity" that gave rise to a static intellectualistic Worldview in the West positioning itself as the Universal and an "integrative unity" that gave rise to a dynamically oriented Worldview based on Dharma.{{sfn|Tilak|2012}} While the former is characterized by a "top-down" essentialism embracing everything a priori, the latter is a "bottom-up" approach acknowledging the dependent co-origination of alternative views of the human and the divine, the body and the mind, and the self and society.

===Divergence 4: The nature of chaos and uncertainty===
Dharma philosophical systems are highly systematized in their approach to understanding ultimate reality and in carefully addressing what one can know through various means of knowledge.  However, this rigor does not restrict their freedom in being comfortable with social organization.  Indians exhibit remarkable openness to self-organization and decentralization.  Malhotra explains the basis for this openness:
{{quote|Hinduism weaves multiple narratives around the central motif of cooperative rivalry between order (personified as devas) and chaos (personified as asuras). A key myth shared by all the dharma traditions – the 'churning of the milky ocean,' or 'samudra-manthan' – shows the eternal struggle between two poles. The milky ocean is the ocean of consciousness and creativity, which is to be churned in order to obtain amrita, or the nectar of eternal life."&lt;ref group=web&gt;{{cite news| author =Rajiv Malhotra |title=Order, chaos and creation|url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/life-style/Order-chaos-and-creation/articleshow/10552328.cms | work=The Times Of India}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Dharma actually recognises the need for both Order and Chaos to co-exist in the universe. In the story&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/life-style/Order-chaos-and-creation/articleshow/10552328.cms | work=The Times Of India | title=Order, chaos and creation – The Times of India}}&lt;/ref&gt; Prajapati attempts to create the Universe keeping Order and Chaos in dynamic balance. His initial attempts fail because they're too 'Jami'/homogenous or too 'Prthak'/different. Finally he gets the combination just-right by using the principle of 'Bandhuta/[[Bandhu]]' i.e. binding together dissimilar things by what is common across all things in the entire creation.

=== Divergence 5: Translatability vs. Sanskrit ===
Malhotra identifies various non-translatables in Sanskrit that have been mapped into Abrahamic religious concepts. These mis-translations then are used to draw sameness arguments or to denounce Hinduism. Malhotra explains that

{{quote|In the fashionable search for sameness in all religions, Holy Spirit in Christianity is often equated with Shakti or kundalini in Hinduism. However, these terms represent different, even incompatible cosmologies. Christianity assumes an inherent dualism between God and creation. This necessitates historical revelations along with prophets, priests and institutions to bring us the truth. But Shakti, being all-pervading, obviates dependence on these; its experience can be discovered by going within through yoga.&lt;ref group=web&gt;{{cite web| author =Rajiv Malhotra |title='Holy Spirit' is not the same as 'Shakti' or 'Kundalini'|url=http://www.beliefnet.com/Faiths/Hinduism/Articles/Holy-Spirit-is-not-the-same-as-Shakti-or-Kundalini.aspx?p=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Malhotra gives example of a list of Sanskrit non-translatables and goes on to provide key differences in their original meaning and the most common translated word in English. For example,{{sfn|Malhotra|2011|p=251-306}}

===Divergence 6: Western universalism challenged===
Malhotra claims that refuting Western Universalism is one of the most important objectives of his book, the conscious effort from American and European individuals to make the rest of the world fit into the template provided by these civilizations. He claims that all people and culture are forced into the various schemes put forward to bring this about and asserts that modern laws, regulation, conventions and common practices are formed, whether consciously or not with Western Universalism in mind.

Malhotra then goes on to provide a case study of Germany for Western digestion and synthesis. He claims that late 18th and early 19th century saw a special interest in ancient India in European academia now called as Romantic movement and Indic origin of European culture started to compete with the earlier held Semitic origin. To satisfy German cultural and religious egotistic interests various German Romantic thinkers like [[Karl Wilhelm Friedrich Schlegel|K. W. F. Schlegel]] and [[Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel|G. W. F. Hagel]] slowly digested Indic ideas, like [[monism]], and presented a caricature of India as the 'frozen other'. Malhotra says Hagel presented, "The ''[[Weltgeist]]'' or World Spirit is, in effect the protagonist of this history, and the West is extraordinary because it is destined to lead this journey while all other civilizations must follow or perish." He claims this narrative gave the West its privileges and those who doesn't fit into this scheme are not a part of history, even though the Spirit may use (parts of) them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Hegel|first1=G. W. F.|title=Phenomenology of Spirit.|date=1977}}&lt;/ref&gt; Malhotra alleges "He (Hegel) laboriously criticizes Sanskrit and Indian civilization, arguing with European Indologists with the aim of assimilating some ideas (such as absolute idealism) into his own philosophy) while postulating India as the inferior other in order to construct his theory of the West. Asia's place in history is as an infant, whereas the West is mature and everyone's eventual destination." This argument led to justification of colonialism as a [[Teleology|teleological imperative]] by which the superior Europeans must appropriate others. For example, Hegel argues it is better for Africans to remain enslaved until they pass through a process of maturation that culminates in their total conversion to Christianity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Schlegel|first1=K. W. F.|title=The Philosophy of History|date=1859|page=120}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hegel regarded colonization as India's inevitable fate and was declared 'static' and incapable of progress by itself, and it was up to the West to colonize and 'operate' on her for her own benefit. Hegel's perception of India as stagnant and lacking history was perpetuated by [[Karl Marx]], who described India as caught in the 'Asiatic Mode of Production'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Marx|first1=Karl|title=The British Rule in India|url=https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1853/06/25.htm|accessdate=2 November 2015|publisher=New-York Herald Tribune|date=1853}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hegel writes, 'The Germanic Spirit (germanische Geist) is the Spirit of the New World (neuen Welt), whose end is the realization of the absolute truth... The destiny of the Germanic people is that of serving as the bearer of the Christian principle'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Hegel|first1=G. W. F.|title=Lectures on the Philosophy of World History|date=1982|page=341}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus Hegel establishes that while the West is pure, some westerners (Germans) are purer than others. As [[Wilhelm Halbfass|Halbfass]] explains, 'European thought has to provide the context and categories for the exploration of all traditions of thought',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Halbfass|first1=Wilhelm|title=India and Europe : An Essay in Understanding|date=1988|publisher=State University of New York Press|isbn=978-0887067952|page=96|url=https://www.amazon.com/India-Europe-An-Essay-Understanding/dp/0887067956|accessdate=2 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; which Malhotra argues sees the digestion of Indian civilization into Western categories as both natural and desirable. Malhotra also writes that, after Hegel's death his sweeping Eurocentric accounts of history was extrapolated which culminates at the Aryan identity. Malhtora states,

{{quote|Hegel's theory of history has led to liberal Western supremacy, which hides behind the notion of providing the 'universals'. These European Enlightenment presuppositions became incorporated in the confluence of academic philosophy, philology, social theories and 'scientific' methodologies – all of which were driven by various imperial and colonial values alongside Christian theology.}}

==Reception==
Several reviews of ''Being Different'' have been published in academic periodicals, that include reviews by Campbell,{{sfn|Campbell|2012}} Wiebe,{{sfn|Wiebe|2012}} Rai,{{sfn|Rai|Prakash|2013}} and Rukmani.{{sfn|Rukmani|2011}} A special issue of the ''[[International Journal of Hindu Studies]]'' was dedicated to discussing ''Being Different'',{{sfn|Springer|2012}} and included articles by
Nicholas F. Gier,{{sfn|Gier|2012}} Shrinivas Tilak,{{sfn|Tilak|2012}} Gerald James Larson,{{sfn|Larson|2012}}
Rita M. Gross, {{sfn|Gross|2012}} Robert A. Yelle,{{sfn|Yelle|2012}} and Cleo McNelly Kearns,{{sfn|Kearns|2012}}
as well as a nearly 40-page response by Malhotra.{{sfn|Malhotra|2012}}{{refn|group=note|The publisher of ''Being Different'' also quotes comments about the book from John M. Hobson, [[Francis X.

In February 2012, Patheos Book Club hosted a discussion of Being Different on their website. &lt;ref group=web name="Patheos Book Club"&gt;{{cite web |title=Patheos Book Club – Being Different|url=http://www.patheos.com/Books/Book-Club/Rajiv-Malhotra-Being-Different.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===International Journal of Hindu Studies===
'''Cleo McNelly Kearns'''

According to Kearns,  Malhotra puts forward a valuable challenge to Christian theology.{{sfn|Kearns|2012|p=349-368}} She also notes that Malhotra himself adds to the "binary thinking" which he rejects.{{sfn|Kearns|2012|p=349-368}}

==== Rita M. Gross ====
According to Gross, Malhotra has located "one of the most urgent tasks for human survival", namely the ability to accommodate diversity without judging one culture over another as superior or inferior.{{sfn|Gross|2012|p=323-334}}

====  Shrinivas Tilak ====
Tilak is appreciative of the "counterreading"{{sfn|Tilak|2012|p=306}} that Malhotra offers. According to Tilak, Malhotra "gives voice to Indic subjects who have been silenced or transformed by nineteenth century and contemporary Indological filters.{{sfn|Tilak|2012|p=306}} Tilak uses the term ''Dharmacatuskam'', "House of Dharma with Its Four Wings (Dharmas)",{{sfn|Tilak|2012|p=291}} to denote the sense of integration that underlies the Hinduism, Buddhism, Jainism and Sikhism traditions.{{sfn|Tilak|2012|p=291}} Tilak points out that Hinduism, Buddhism, Jainism and Sikhism offer various approaches to dharma, which are "not unitary but composite".{{sfn|Tilak|2012|p=295}}

====Gerald James Larson====
Gerald James Larson is critical of Malhotra's presentation of "differences". According to Larson,
Malhotra ignores the differences, to arrive at a "integral unity" "that is little more than a Neo-Vedanta or Neo-Hindu reading of the Bhagavad Gita documented with numerous citations from Aurobindo." Larson calls this the "Brahmin imaginary",{{refn|group=note|Doniger: "It is often convenient to speak of a Brahmin-oriented quasi-orthodoxy (or ortho-praxy [...]), which we might call the Brahmin imaginary or the idealized system of class and life stage (''varna-ashrama-dharma''). but whatever we call this constructed center, it is, like the empty center in the Zen diagram of Hinduisms, simply an imaginary point around which we orient all the actual Hindus who accept or oppose it; it is what Indian logicians call the straw man (''purva paksha''), against whom argues. The actual beliefs and practices of Hindus – renunciation, devotion, sacrifice, and so many more – are peripheries that the imaginary Brahmin center cannot hold.{{sfn|Doniger|2010|p=29-30}}}} the standard Brahmanical view of Indic religion and philosophy in its [[Neo-Vedanta|Neo-Hindu]] understanding.{{sfn|Larson|2012|p=313}} According to Larson, the "Brahmin imaginary" is an imagined "integral unity" that is adhered to only by a cultural elite, with very little reality "on the ground", as it were, throughout the centuries of cultural development in the South Asian region.{{sfn|Larson|2012|p=313}} Larson also criticises the use of the term "Dharma traditions" or "dharmic systems", which ignores the differences between the various Indian religions.{{sfn|Larson|2012|p=313}} Larson ends his review with the recommendation to move toward a future in which "being different" really reflects the  "differences' in Indic religion and thought, "in a manner that challenges but also learns from the ongoing interactions with "the West.""{{sfn|Larson|2012|p=320}}

====Robert A. Yelle====
Robert A. Yelle is highly critical of Malhotra's approach. According to Yelle, "there is little, if any, original scholarship in the book. It is the work of a polemicist," who uses western scholarship when criticizing the West, but ignores this scholarship when he presents his own nativist vision of "dharmic traditions." According to Yelle, Malhotra's vision is a mirror image of Orientalism, namely Occidentalism.{{sfn|Yelle|2012|p=337-338}} Robert A. Yelle also criticises Malhotra for his use of the term "dharmic traditions".{{sfn|Yelle|2012}} According to Yelle, Malhotra ignores the differences that exist among and within the various traditions of India. According to Yelle, Malhotra presents a thoroughly homogenized ideal of Hinduism, based on a limited choice of aspects from Vedanta philosophy and Yoga.{{sfn|Yelle|2012|p=338-339}} Yelle ends his review with the remark that there has been a gradual improvement in Western scholars' knowledge of Indian traditions. To come to a real dialogue, Indians must also be willing to look in the mirror, and be open to self-criticism.{{sfn|Yelle|2012|p=346}}

====Nicholas F. Gier====
Gier criticizes Malhotra for ignoring profound differences between Dharmic traditions in seeing an integral unity. Gier notices that Malhotra himself admits that there are ‘profound differences in theory and practice' in the Dharma traditions. According to Gier,this undermines Malhotra's principal claim that these philosophical schools are "integral".{{sfn|Gier|2012}}

===Other peer-reviewed reviews===
====Brian Campbell====
In the ''Journal of the Anthropological Society of Oxford'', Brian Campbell wrote that the book succeeds in fulfilling only one of its four goals. According to Campbell, it gives a simplistic view of modern colonialism. It also fails to reverse the gaze, and to apply dharmic categories to Western socio-cultural reality. According to Campbell, Malhotra does
succeed in tracing the difference between Western and Oriental thought.{{sfn|Campbell|2012|p=225}}

The term '''computer-supported cooperative work''' ('''CSCW''') was first coined by [[Irene Greif]] and Paul M. Cashman in 1984, at a workshop attended by individuals interested in using technology to support people in their work.&lt;ref name=Grudin1994&gt;{{cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt; At about this same time, in 1987 Dr. Charles Findley presented the concept of Collaborative Learning-Work.&lt;ref&gt;.Findley, Charles A. 1989. Collaborative Learning-work. Presentation at the Pacific Telecommunications Council 1989 Conference, January 15–20, Honolulu, Hawaii.[https://archive.org/details/CollaborativeNetworkedLearningProject-DigitalEquipmentCorporation Collaborative Networked Learning Project – Digital Equipment Corporation]. Primary documents stored on Internet Archive&lt;/ref&gt;
According to Carstensen and Schmidt,&lt;ref name=Carstensen1999&gt;{{cite journal

 }}&lt;/ref&gt; CSCW addresses "how collaborative activities and their coordination can be supported by means of [[computer system]]s". On the one hand, many authors consider that CSCW and [[groupware]] are synonyms. On the other hand, different authors claim that while groupware refers to real computer-based systems, CSCW focuses on the study of tools and techniques of groupware ''as well as'' their psychological, social, and organizational effects. The definition of Wilson (1991)&lt;ref name=Wilson1991&gt;{{cite book

 }}&lt;/ref&gt; expresses the difference between these two concepts:

{{quote|CSCW [is] a generic term, which combines the understanding of the way people work in groups with the enabling technologies of computer networking, and associated hardware, [[software]], services and techniques.}}

==Central concerns==

CSCW is a design-oriented academic field that is interdisciplinary in nature and brings together economists, organizational theorists, educators, social psychologists, sociologists, anthropologists and computer scientists, among others. The expertise of researchers in various and combined disciplines help researchers identify venues for possible development. Despite the variety of disciplines, CSCW is an identifiable research field focused on understanding characteristics of interdependent group work with the objective of designing adequate computer-based technology to support such cooperative work.

Essentially, CSCW goes beyond building technology itself and looks at how people work within groups and organizations and the impacts of technology on those processes. CSCW has ushered in a great extent of melding between [[Social science|social scientists]] and technologists as developers work together to overcome both technical and non-technical problems within the same user spaces. For example, many R&amp;D professionals working with CSCW are computer scientists who have realized that social factors play an important role in the development of collaborative systems. On the flip side, many social scientists who understand the increasing role of technology in our social world become "technologists" who work in R&amp;D labs to develop cooperative systems.

Over the years, CSCW researchers have identified a number of core dimensions of cooperative work. A non-exhaustive list includes:
* ''Awareness'': individuals working together need to be able to gain some level of shared knowledge about each other's activities.&lt;ref name=dourish92&gt;{{cite conference

These concepts have largely been derived through the analysis of systems designed by researchers in the CSCW community, or through studies of existing systems (for example, Wikipedia&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Stuart Geiger|editor1-last=Lovink &amp; Tkacz|title="The Lives of Bots" in Critical Point of View: A Wikipedia Reader|date=2011|url=http://www.stuartgeiger.com/lives-of-bots-wikipedia-cpov.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;). CSCW researchers that design and build systems try to address core concepts in novel ways. However, the complexity of the domain makes it difficult to produce conclusive results; the success of CSCW systems is often so contingent on the peculiarities of the social context that it is hard to generalize. Consequently, CSCW systems that are based on the design of successful ones may fail to be appropriated in other seemingly similar contexts for a variety of reasons that are nearly impossible to identify ''a priori''.&lt;ref name=grudin88&gt;{{cite conference

 }}&lt;/ref&gt; CSCW researcher [[Mark Ackerman]] calls this "divide between what we know we must support socially and what we can support technically" the socio-technical gap and describes CSCW's main research agenda to be "exploring, understanding, and hopefully ameliorating" this gap.&lt;ref name=Ackerman00&gt;{{cite journal

==Matrix==
[[Image:cscwmatrix.jpg|thumb|400px|right|the CSCW Matrix]]

One of the most common ways of conceptualizing CSCW systems is to consider the context of a system's use. One such conceptualization is the CSCW Matrix, first introduced in 1988 by Johansen; it also appears in Baecker (1995).&lt;ref name=Baecker1995&gt;{{cite book
 | author = Baecker, R.M.
 |author2=Others,
 | year = 1995
 | title = Readings in human-computer interaction: toward the year 2000
 | publisher = Morgan Kaufmann Publishers
 | isbn =
 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The matrix considers work contexts along two dimensions: first, whether collaboration is co-located or geographically distributed, and second, whether individuals collaborate synchronously (same time) or asynchronously (not depending on others to be around at the same time).

===Same time/same place===
Face to face interaction
* Roomware
* Shared tables, wall displays
* Digital whiteboards
* [[Electronic meeting system]]s
* Single display groupware
* Group Decision Support System

===Same time/different place===
Remote interaction
* [[Electronic meeting system]]s
* [[Videoconferencing]] 
* Real-time groupware
* Messaging ([[instant messaging]], [[email]], [[Online chat|chat]])
*telephoning

===Different time/same place===
Continuous task (Ongoing task )
* Team rooms,
* Large displays
* Post-it
* Warrooms

===Different time/different place===
Communication + Coordination
* [[Electronic meeting system]]s
* [[Blogs]]
* [[Workflow]]
* [[Version control]]

There is a collaborative mode called multi-synchronous that can not fit the matrix.

==Challenges==

===Leadership===
Generally, teams working in a CSCW environment need the same types of [[leadership]] as other teams. However, research has shown that distributed CSCW teams may need more direction at the time the group is formed than traditional working groups, largely to promote cohesion and liking among people who may not have as many opportunities to interact in person, both before and after the formation of the working group.&lt;ref name=T&amp;C2006&gt;{{cite journal|last=Thompson|first=L.F|last2=Coovert |first2=M.D|title=Understanding and developing virtual computer-supported cooperative work teams.|journal=Creating Hi-tech Teams|year=2006|pages=213–241|editor1-first=C. |editor1-last=Bowers |editor2-first=E. |editor2-last=Salas |editor3-first=F. |editor3-last=Jentsch}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Adoption of groupware===
[[Groupware]] goes hand in hand with CSCW. The term refers to software that is designed to support activities of a group or organization over a network and includes email, conferencing tools, group calendars, workflow management tools, etc.&lt;ref name=OlsonOlson2008&gt;{{cite journal|last=Olson|first=J.M.|last2=Olson |first2=J.S.|title=The human computer interaction handbook: Fundamentals, evolving technologies, and emerging applications|journal=Group Cooperative Work|year=2008|pages=545–558|editor1-last=Sears |editor1-first=A. |editor2-last=Jacko |editor2-first=J. A.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While groupware enables geographically dispersed teams to achieve organizational goals and engage in cooperative work, there are also many challenges that accompany use of such systems. For instance, groupware often requires users to learn a new system, which users may perceive as creating more work for them without much benefit. If team members are not willing to learn and adopt groupware, it is difficult (if not impossible) for the organization to develop the requisite [[Critical mass (sociodynamics)|critical mass]] for the groupware to be useful. Further, research has found that groupware requires careful implementation into a group setting, and product developers have not as yet been able to find the most optimal way to introduce such systems into organizational environments.&lt;ref name=OlsonOlson2008 /&gt;

On the technical side, networking issues with groupware often create challenges in using groupware for CSCW. While access to the Internet is becoming increasingly ubiquitous, geographically dispersed users still face challenges of differing network conditions. For instance, [[web conferencing]] can be quite challenging if some members have a very slow connection and others are able to utilize high speed connections.&lt;ref name=OlsonOlson2008 /&gt;

===Intergenerational groups===
One of the recurring challenges in CSCW environments is development of an infrastructure that can bridge cross-[[Generation gap|generational gaps]] in virtual teams.&lt;ref name=Convertino2007&gt;{{cite journal|last=Convertino|first=J.|author2=Farooq, U. |author3=Rosson, M. |author4=Carroll, J. |author5=Meyer, B. |title=Supporting intergenerational groups in computer-supported cooperative work (CSCW)|journal=Behaviour Information Technology|year=2007|volume=26|series=4|pages=275–285|doi=10.1080/01449290601173473|issue=4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ideally, system designs will accommodate all team members, but orienting older workers to new CSCW tools can often be difficult. This can cause problems in virtual teams due to the necessity of incorporating the wealth of knowledge and expertise that older workers bring to the table with the technological challenges of new virtual environments. Orienting and retraining older workers to effectively utilize new technology can often be difficult, as they generally have less experience than younger workers with learning such new technologies.

==Advantages==
While CSCW working environments certainly face challenges, they also provide many advantages as well. For instance, teams that work together asynchronously provide members with the luxury to contribute when they want, from the location of their choosing, thus eliminating the need for members to "synchronize schedules".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Thompson|first=L.F.|author2=Coovert, M. D.|title=Teamwork online: The effects of computer conferencing on perceived confusion, satisfaction, and post-discussion accuracy|journal=Group Dynamics: Theory, Research, and Practice|year=2003|volume=7|issue=2|pages=135–151|doi=10.1037/1089-2699.7.2.135}}&lt;/ref&gt;  CSCW also allows employees with specific expertise to be a part of teams without the concern of geographic restraints."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Kraut|first=R.E.|last2=Fussell |first2=S. R. |last3=Brennan |first3=S. E. |last4=Siegel |first4=J |title=Understanding effects of proximity on collaboration: Implications for technologies to support remote collaborative work|journal=Distributed Work.|year=2002|editor1-first=P. |editor1-last=Hinds |editor2-first=S. |editor2-last=Kiesler}}&lt;/ref&gt;

CSCW can also result in major cost savings to companies who implement virtual teams and allow employees to work at home by eliminating the need for travel, rented office space, parking, electricity office equipment, etc. Conversely, from the employee’s perspective, commuting costs and time associated with communing are also eliminated.
 
Further, research has shown that the use of multiple [[Conversation threading|communication threads]] can increase group participation and contribution from more team members and foster a more egalitarian communication structure.&lt;ref name=OlsonOlson2008 /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Bordia|first=P.|title=Face-to-face versus computer-mediated communication: A synthesis of the experimental literature|journal=Journal of Business Communication|year=1997|volume=34|pages=99–120|doi=10.1177/002194369703400106}}&lt;/ref&gt; Along the same lines, text-based CSCW communication, such as email, allows users to keep a record of communication and can promote long-term collaboration and learning through observing others.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Olson|first=J.S.|author2=Olson, G.M.|title=Computer supported cooperative work|journal=Template:Olson, J.s., &amp; Olson G.M. (1999). Computer Supported Cooperative Work. In F.T. Durso, R.S. Nickerson, R.W. Schvaneveldt, S.T. Dumais, D.S. Lindsay, &amp; M.T.H Chi (Eds.), Handbook of Applied Cognition|year=1999|pages=409–442|editors=Durso, R.S. Nickerson, R.W. Schvaneveldt, S.T. Dumais, D.S. Lindsay, &amp; M.T.H Chi}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Challenges in research==

===Differing meanings===
Even within the CSCW field, researchers often rely on different journals, research, contextual factors and schools of thought, which can result in disagreement and confusion especially when common terms in the field are used in subtly different ways ("user", "implementation", etc.) Also, user requirements change over time and are often not clear to participants due to their evolving nature and the fact that requirements are always in flux.&lt;ref name="Grudin1994"/&gt;

===Identifying user needs===
Because organizations are so nuanced, CSCW researchers often have difficulty deciding which set(s) of tools will benefit a particular group.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Koch|first=M|author2=Gross, T|title=Computer-Supported Cooperative Work - Concepts and Trends|journal=Proc Conf of the Association Information and Management AIM|year=2006|volume=75|pages=165–172}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is exacerbated by the fact that it is almost impossible to accurately identify user/group/organization needs and requirements because such needs and requirements inevitably change through the introduction of the system itself. Even when researchers study requirements through several iterations, such requirements often change and evolve yet again by the time that researchers have completed a particular iteration of inquiry.

===Evaluation and measurement===
The range of disciplinary approaches leveraged in implementing CSCW systems makes CSCW difficult to evaluate, measure, and generalize to multiple populations. Because researchers evaluating CSCW systems often bypass [[quantitative data]] in favor of naturalistic inquiry, results can be largely subjective due to the complexity and nuances of organizations themselves. Possibly as a result of the debate between qualitative and quantitative researchers, three evaluation approaches have emerged in the literature examining CSCW systems. However, each approach faces its own unique challenges and weaknesses:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Neale|first=D |author2=Carrol, J |author3=Rosson, M|title=Evaluating Computer-Supported Cooperative Work: Models and Frameworks|journal=CSCW '04 Proceedings of the 2004 ACM Conference on Computer Supported Cooperative Work|year=2004|doi=10.1145/1031607.1031626|isbn=978-1581138108|pages=112}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Methodology-oriented frameworks explain the methods of inquiry available to CSCW researchers without providing guidance for selecting the best method for a particular research question or population.

Conceptual frameworks provide guidelines for determining factors that a researcher should consider and evaluate through CSCW research but fail to link conceptual constructs with methodological approaches. Thus, while researchers may know what factors are important to their inquiry, they may have difficulty understanding which methodologies will result in the most informative findings.

Concept-oriented frameworks provide specific advice for studying isolated aspects of CSCW but lack guidance as to how specific areas of study can be combined to form more comprehensive insight.

==Conferences==

Since 2010, the [[Association for Computing Machinery]] has hosted a yearly conference on CSCW. From 1986-2010, it was held biannually.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=ACM Digital Library|url=http://dl.acm.org/event.cfm?id=RE169}}&lt;/ref&gt; The conference is currently held in February or March and features research in the design and use of technologies that affect organizational and group work. With the rapidly increasing development of new devices that allow collaboration from different locations and contexts, CSCW seeks to bring together researchers from across academia and industry to discuss the many facets of [[virtual collaboration]] from both social and technical perspectives.

Internationally, The Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers sponsors the International Conference on Computer Supported Work and Design, which takes place yearly.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers|url=http://2012.cscwd.org/}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, the European Society for Socially Embedded Technologies sponsors the European Conference on Computer Supported Cooperative Work, which has been held every two years since 1989.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=European Society for Socially Embedded Technologies|url=http://www.ecscw.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=ECSCW – European Conference on Computer-Supported Cooperative Work – EUSSET |url=http://www.ecscw.org/ |website=www.ecscw.org |accessdate=6 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2366">A '''cyclic flower''' is a flower type formed out of a series of [[Whorl (botany)|whorls]];&lt;ref name="Swartz"&gt;{{cite book|page=136|title=Collegiate Dictionary of Botany|last=Swartz|first=Delbert|publisher=The Ronald Press Company|location=New York|year=1971}}&lt;/ref&gt; sets of identical organs attached around the axis at the same point. Most flowers consist of a single whorl of [[sepal]]s termed a [[Calyx (botany)|calyx]]; a single whorl of [[petal]]s termed a [[corolla (flower)|corolla]]; one or more whorls of [[stamen]]s (together termed the [[androecium]]); and a single whorl of [[carpel]]s termed the [[gynoecium]]. This is a cyclic arrangement.

Some flowers contain flower parts with a spiral arrangement. Such flowers are not cyclic. However in the common case of spirally arranged sepals on an otherwise cyclic flower, the term '''hemicyclic''' may be used.&lt;ref name="Jackson"&gt;{{cite book|page=174|title=A Glossary of Botanic Terms with their Derivation and Accent|last=Jackson|first=Benjamin Daydon|edition=fourth|publisher=Gerald Duckworth &amp; Co. Ltd.|location=London|year=1928|url=https://archive.org/details/glossaryofbotani1928jack}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The suffix '''-cyclic''' is used to denote the number of whorls contained within a flower. The most common case is the '''pentacyclic''' flower, which contains five whorls:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|page=271|title=A Glossary of Botanic Terms with their Derivation and Accent|last=Jackson|first=Benjamin Daydon|edition=fourth|publisher=Gerald Duckworth &amp; Co. Ltd.|location=London|year=1928|url=https://archive.org/details/glossaryofbotani1928jack}}&lt;/ref&gt; a calyx, a corolla, two whorls of stamens, and a single whorl of carpels. Another common case is the '''tetracyclic''' flower, which contains only one whorl of stamens, and therefore only four whorls in total. '''Tricyclic''' flowers also occur, generally where there is a single undifferentiated [[Petal|perianth]]. Flowers with more than five whorls are also not uncommon. The greatest variation occurs in the calyx and the androecium. Calyces of up to nine whorls have been recorded, and up to 12 whorls of stamens have been observed.

'''Dematic''' is a supplier of integrated automated [[supply chain]] technology, software and services. With a growth rate of 25% in 2016 Dematic is listed as the world's third-largest materials handling systems supplier.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.mmh.com/article/top_20_systems_suppliers_2016|title=Top 20 systems suppliers, 2016|website=www.mmh.com|access-date=2017-04-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; The company employs over 6,000 people and has engineering centres and manufacturing facilities in the [[United States]], [[Mexico]], [[Australia]], [[Germany]], [[Italy]] and [[China]]. Its customer base includes small, medium and large companies. 

Since November 2016 Dematic has been a member of [[KION Group]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.logisticsmgmt.com/article/kion_completes_its_acquisition_of_dematic|title=KION completes its acquisition of Dematic|website=www.logisticsmgmt.com|access-date=2017-04-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dematic's headquarters are located in [[Grand Rapids, Michigan|Grand Rapids]], [[Michigan]].

==History==
Dematic began in 1819 in [[Wetter (Ruhr)|Wetter]], Germany with the founding of {{ill|Mechanische Werkstätten Harkort &amp; Co.|de}}, which was incorporated 1910 by {{ill|Deutsche Maschinenbau-Aktiengesellschaft|de|Demag}} (Demag) and 1973 by [[Mannesmann AG|Mannesmann]]. After the acquisition of U.S. Rapistan (specialised in conveyor systems), Mannesmann DEMAG Fördertechnik AG was established. In 1993, Australian racking and shelving manufacturer Colby was added, and in 1997 the company was renamed to Mannesmann Dematic AG. Four years later, [[Siemens]] bought the company&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://europa.eu/rapid/press-release_IP-00-955_en.htm|title=Commission gives Siemens conditional go-ahead to take control of Mannesmann subsidiaries Dematic, VDO and Sachs.|last=|first=|date=29 August 2000|publisher=European Union|dead-url=|work=|accessdate=2017-04-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; and merged it with its own logistics activities to form Siemens Dematic AG. In 2006 Siemens carved out the industrial and distribution logistics portion as Dematic GmbH &amp; Co. KG. In the same year, the investment firm Triton acquired the majority of shares.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.siemens.com/press/en/pr_cc/2006/06_jun/dem060616_1385408.htm|title=Triton takes over Dematic|last=|first=|date=June 14, 2006|website=|publisher=Siemens AG, Official Press Release|dead-url=|accessdate=2017-04-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On September 15, 2010, Dematic Group successfully completed the acquisition of HK Systems, a North American automated [[material handling]] and software provider. The expanded manufacturing footprint allows Dematic to manufacture within the USA [[Automated storage and retrieval system|storage and retrieval machines]] and [[Automated Guided Vehicle|automated guided vehicles]] in addition to [[conveyor]], sortation and [[order fulfillment]] technology.

On December 28, 2012, AEA Investors LP ("AEA") and Teachers' Private Capital ("TPC"), the private investment division of the Ontario Teachers’ Pension Plan, completed their acquisition of Dematic from private equity firm Triton.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.dgap.de/dgap/News/dgap_media/triton-sells-dematic-private-equity-investor-aea-investors-and-ontario-teachers-pension-plan/?newsID=739415|title=Triton sells Dematic to private equity investor AEA Investors and Ontario Teachers' Pension Plan|last=|first=|date=November 2012|website=|publisher=DGAP-Media|accessdate=2017-04-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 2015 Dematic acquired SDI Group Europe, a supplier of garment on hanger and flat sorter technology in Europe.

In November 2015, Dematic acquired Reddwerks Corp. pending approval of the shareholders. The acquisition became final in December 2015.

In March 2016 Dematic acquired NDC Automation, a leading provider of automated guided vehicles and software.

In June 2016, KION Group agreed to buy Dematic for about $2.1 billion.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.newequipment.com/Main/topstories/Kion-Gets-Warehouse-Robotics-With-21-Billion-Demat-1467.aspx|title=Kion Gets Warehouse Robotics With $2.1 Billion Dematic Deal|last=|first=|date=2016-06-21|website=|publisher=New Equipment Digest|dead-url=|accessdate=2017-04-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; In November 2016, KION Group completed the acquisition.

On March 13, 2017 Dematic announced the integration of Egemin Automation to create the world's leading provider of automated guided vehicle technology.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.dematic.com/en/news-and-downloads/news-and-events/press-releases/2017/2017/03/10/18/45/2017-03-13-dematic-completes-egemin-integration/|title=Dematic completes Egemin Integration|last=|first=|date=|website=www.dematic.com|language=en|dead-url=|access-date=2017-04-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Desakota''' is a term used in [[urban geography]] used to describe areas in the extended surroundings of large cities, in which urban and agricultural forms of land use and settlement coexist and are intensively intermingled.

The term was coined by the urban researcher Terry McGee of the [[University of British Columbia]] around 1990. It comes from [[Indonesian language|Indonesian]] ''desa'' "[[village]]" and kota "[[city]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |first=Stephen |last=Cairns |title=Troubling Real-estate: Reflecting on Urban Form in Southeast Asia |work=Critical Reflections on Cities in Southeast Asia |year=2002 |page=117}}&lt;/ref&gt; Desakota areas typically occur in Asia, especially [[South East Asia]]. Examples can be found in the urbanised regions of [[Java]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |first=Terry G. |last=McGee |title=Reconstructing ›The Southeast Asian City‹ in an Era of Volatile Globalization |work=Critical Reflections on Cities in Southeast Asia |year=2002 |pages=33–34}}&lt;/ref&gt; the densely populated, delta-shaped areas on the peripheries of the [[Jakarta]] agglomeration ("[[Jabodetabek]]"), but also the extended metropolitan regions of [[Bangkok]] or [[Manila]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |author=McGee |title=Reconstructing ›The Southeast Asian City‹ |year=2002 |pages=47–48}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Desakota areas are situated outside the periurban zones, from which daily commuting is easily possible, i.e. more than 30 or 50&amp;nbsp;km off the city centre. They often sprawl alongside arterial and communication roads, sometimes from one agglomeration to the next. They are characterised by high population density and intensive agricultural use (especially [[Paddy field|wet-rice cultivation]]), but differ from densely populated rural areas by more urban-like characteristics.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |author=McGee |title=The Emergence of ''Desakota'' Regions in Asia. |year=1991 |pages=6–7}}&lt;/ref&gt; These criteria are: developed transport networks, high population mobility, increasing activity outside the agricultural sector, the coexistence of many different forms of land use, more female participation in paid labour, and unregulated land use.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last1=Chia |first1=Lin Sien |first2=Martin |last2=Perry |title=Introduction |work=Southeast Asia Transformed: A Geography of Change |publisher=Institute of Southeast Asian Studies |place=Singapur |year=2003 |isbn=981-230-119-4 |page=12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Given their rambling extent and indistinct boundaries, the emergence of Desakota regions brings difficulties for the administration, as uniform plans, regulations or designs are hardly viable. Desakota regions are characterised by high mobility of goods and services and rapid change in patterns of settlement. They usually elude the division in functually specialised zones that is conventionally applied in urban geography. Completely different forms of use, as e.g. traditional agriculture, large scale and cottage industry, amusement parks and golf courses, shopping centres and retail parks, and forms of settlement from [[shanty town]]s to [[gated community]] coexist in them close to each other.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |author=Cairns |title=Troubling Real-estate |year=2002 |page=118}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Developmental psychology''' is the [[scientific]] study of how and why [[human]] beings change over the course of their life. Originally concerned with [[infants]] and [[child]]ren, the field has expanded to include [[adolescence]], [[adult development]], [[aging]], and the entire lifespan. Developmental psychologists aim to explain how thinking, feeling, and behaviors change throughout life.  This field examines change across three major dimensions: [[physical development]], [[cognitive development]], and socioemotional development.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.apa.org/action/science/developmental/index.aspx|title=Developmental Psychology Studies Human Development Across the Lifespan|last=|first=|date=|website=www.apa.org|language=en|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140709054242/http://www.apa.org/action/science/developmental/index.aspx|archive-date=2014-07-09|dead-url=yes|access-date=2017-08-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Citation needed|date=April 2017}} Within these three dimensions are a broad range of topics including [[motor skills]], [[executive functions]], [[morality|moral understanding]], [[language acquisition]], [[social change]], [[personality]], emotional development, [[self-concept]], and [[identity formation]].

Developmental psychology examines the influences of nature ''and'' nurture on the process of human development, and processes of change in context and across time. Many researchers are interested in the interactions among personal characteristics, the individual's behavior, and [[environmental factor]]s, including the [[social context]] and the [[built environment]]. Ongoing debates include biological [[essentialism]] vs. [[neuroplasticity]] and [[Developmental stage theories|stages of development]] vs. dynamic systems of development.

Developmental psychology involves a range of fields, such as [[educational psychology]], [[child psychopathology]], [[forensic developmental psychology]], [[child development]], [[cognitive psychology]], [[ecological psychology]], and [[cultural psychology]]. Influential developmental psychologists from the 20th century include [[Urie Bronfenbrenner]], [[Erik Erikson]], [[Sigmund Freud]], [[Jean Piaget]], [[Barbara Rogoff]], [[Esther Thelen]], and [[Lev Vygotsky]].

==Historical antecedents==
[[John B. Watson]] and [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau]] are typically cited as providing the foundations for modern developmental psychology.&lt;ref name=Hogan&gt;{{cite book|last=Hogan|first=John D|authorlink=John D. Hogan|title=Encyclopedia of Psychology|location=Volume 3|isbn=978-1-55798-652-8|pages=9–13|chapter=Developmental psychology: History of the field|editor=Alan E. Kazdin|editor-link=Alan E. Kazdin|accessdate=|doi=10.1037/10518-003|year=2000}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the mid-18th century Jean Jacques Rousseau described three stages of development: ''infants'' (infancy), ''puer'' (childhood) and ''adolescence'' in ''[[Emile: Or, On Education]]''. Rousseau's ideas were taken up strongly by educators at the time.

It generally focuses on how and why certain modifications throughout an individual’s life-cycle (cognitive, social, intellectual, personality) and human growth change over time. There are many theorists that have made a profound contribution to this area of psychology. For example, [[Erik Erikson]] developed a model of eight stages of psychological development. He believed that humans developed in stages throughout their lifetimes and this would affect their behaviors (Similar ideas to [[Sigmund Freud]])&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Erikson and Erikson|first1=E and J. M.|title=The Life-Cycle Completed|date=1998|publisher=Norton and Company|edition=Extended version}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the late 19th century, psychologists familiar with the [[evolutionary theory]] of [[Charles Darwin|Darwin]] began seeking an evolutionary description of psychological development;&lt;ref name=Hogan /&gt; prominent here was the pioneering psychologist [[G. Stanley Hall]],&lt;ref name=Hogan /&gt; who attempted to correlate ages of childhood with previous ages of humanity. [[James Mark Baldwin]] who wrote essays on topics that included ''Imitation: A Chapter in the Natural History of Consciousness'' and ''Mental Development in the Child and the Race: Methods and Processes''. [[James Mark Baldwin]] was heavily involved in the theory of developmental psychology.&lt;ref name=Hogan /&gt; [[Sigmund Freud]], whose concepts were developmental, significantly affected public perceptions.&lt;ref name=Hogan /&gt;

==Theories==

===Psychosexual development===
{{Main|Psychosexual development}}
[[Sigmund Freud]] believed that we all had a conscious, preconscious, and unconscious level. In the conscious, we are aware of our mental process. The preconscious involves information that, though not currently in our thoughts, can be brought into consciousness. Lastly, the unconscious includes mental processes we are unaware of.

He believed there is tension between the conscious and unconscious because the conscious tries to hold back what the unconscious tries to express. To explain this he developed three personality structures: the id, ego, and superego. The id, the most primitive of the three, functions according to the pleasure principle: seek pleasure and avoid pain.&lt;ref name="Theories2"&gt;{{cite book|title=Theories of personality: understanding persons|last=Cloninger|first=Susan C.|publisher=Pearson Education|isbn=978-0-205-25624-2|edition=6th|location=Boston|pages=19–101}}&lt;/ref&gt; The superego plays the critical and moralizing role; and the ego is the organized, realistic part that mediates between the desires of the id and the superego.&lt;ref name="Snowden2"&gt;{{cite book|title=Teach Yourself Freud|last=Snowden|first=Ruth|publisher=[[McGraw-Hill]]|year=2006|isbn=978-0-07-147274-6|pages=105–107}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Based on this, he proposed five universal stages of development, that each is characterized by the erogenous zone that is the source of the child's psychosexual energy. The first is the ''oral stage'', which occurs from birth to 12 months of age. During the oral stage, "the libido is centered in a baby's mouth." The baby is able to suck. The second is the ''anal stage'', from one to three years of age. During the anal stage, the child defecates from the anus and is often fascinated with their defecation. The third is the ''[[phallic stage]]'', which occurs from three to five years of age (most of a person's personality forms by this age). During the phallic stage, the child is aware of their sexual organs. The fourth is the ''latency stage'', which occurs from age five until puberty. During the latency stage, the child's sexual interests are repressed. Stage five is the ''[[genital stage]]'', which takes place from puberty until adulthood. During the genital stage, puberty starts happening.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.simplypsychology.org/psychosexual.html|title=Psychosexual Stages|website=SimplyPsychology|last1=McLeod|first1=Saul}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Theories of cognitive development===
{{Main|Piaget's theory of cognitive development}}
[[Jean Piaget]], a Swiss theorist, posited that children learn by actively constructing knowledge through hands-on experience.&lt;ref name="WoodWoodBoyd2"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Mastering the world of psychology|publisher=Allyn &amp; Bacon|year=2006|edition=2|author1=Wood, S.E.|author2=Wood, C.E.|author3=Boyd D.}}&lt;/ref&gt; He suggested that the adult's role in helping the child learn was to provide appropriate materials that the child can interact with and use to construct. He used [[Socratic questioning]] to get children to reflect on what they were doing, and he tried to get them to see contradictions in their explanations.

Piaget believed that intellectual development takes place through a series of stages, which he described in his theory on cognitive development. Each stage consists of steps the child must master before moving to the next step. He believed that these stages are not separate from one another, but rather that each stage builds on the previous one in a continuous learning process. He proposed four stages: ''sensorimotor'', ''pre-operational'', ''concrete operational'', and ''formal operational''. Though he did not believe these stages occurred at any given age, many studies have determined when these cognitive abilities should take place.&lt;ref name="Edpsych24"&gt;{{cite book|title=Edpsych : modules|last=Reese-Weber|first=Lisa Bohlin, Cheryl Cisero Durwin, Marla|publisher=McGraw-Hill Humanities/Social Sciences/Languages|isbn=978-0-07-809786-7|edition=2nd|location=New York|pages=30–132}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Stages of moral development===
{{Main|Lawrence Kohlberg's stages of moral development}}
Piaget claimed that logic and morality develop through constructive stages.&lt;ref name="higheststage2"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Kohlberg|first=Lawrence|year=1973|title=The Claim to Moral Adequacy of a Highest Stage of Moral Judgment|journal=Journal of Philosophy|publisher=The Journal of Philosophy, Vol. 70, No. 18|volume=70|issue=18|pages=630–646|doi=10.2307/2025030|jstor=2025030}}&lt;/ref&gt; Expanding on Piaget's work, [[Lawrence Kohlberg]] determined that the process of moral development was principally concerned with justice, and that it continued throughout the individual's lifetime.&lt;ref name="dissertation2"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Kohlberg|first=Lawrence|year=1958|title=The Development of Modes of Thinking and Choices in Years 10 to 16|journal=Ph. D. Dissertation, University of Chicago}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He suggested three levels of moral reasoning; pre-conventional moral reasoning, conventional moral reasoning, and post-conventional moral reasoning.  The pre-conventional moral reasoning is typical of children and is characterized by reasoning that is based on rewards and punishments associated with different courses of action. Conventional moral reason occurs during late childhood and early adolescence and is characterized by reasoning based on rules and conventions of society. Lastly, post-conventional moral reasoning is a stage during which the individual sees society's rules and conventions as relative and subjective, rather than as authoritative.&lt;ref name="Adolescence3"&gt;{{cite book|title=Adolescence|last=Steinberg|first=Laurence|publisher=McGraw-Hill Higher Education|year=2008|isbn=978-0-07-340548-3|edition=8th|location=Boston|pages=60–365|authorlink=Laurence Steinberg}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Kohlberg used the Heinz Dilemma to apply to his stages of moral development. The Heinz Dilemma involves Heinz's wife dying from cancer and Heinz having the dilemma to save his wife by stealing a drug. Preconventional morality, conventional morality, and post-conventional morality applies to Heinz's situation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.simplypsychology.org/kohlberg.html|title=Kohlberg|website=SimplyPsychology|last1=McLeod|first1=Saul}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Stages of psychosocial development===
{{Main|Erikson's stages of psychosocial development}}
German-American psychologist [[Erik Erikson]] and his collaborator and wife, [[Joan Erikson]], conceptualized eight stages of psychosocial development that they theorized healthy individuals pass through as they develop from infancy to adulthood.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|last=Thomas|first=Robert McG., Jr.|title=Joan Erikson Is Dead at 95; Shaped Thought on Life Cycles|date=8 August 1997|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1997/08/08/us/joan-erikson-is-dead-at-95-shaped-thought-on-life-cycles.html|newspaper=The New York Times|accessdate=23 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first stage is called "Trust vs. Mistrust" takes place in infancy. The best virtue for the first stage is hope, in the infant learning who to trust and having hope for a supportive group of people to be there for him/her. The second stage is "Autonomy vs. Shame and Doubt" with the best virtue being will. This takes place in early childhood where the child learns to become more independent by discovering what they are capable of where if the child is overly controlled, they believe to feel inadequate on surviving by themselves, which can lead to low self-esteem and doubt. The third stage is "Initiative vs. Guilt". The basic virtue that would be gained is the purpose and takes place in the play age. This is the stage where the child will be curious and have many interactions with other kids. They will ask many questions as their curiosity grows. If too much guilt is present, the child may have a slower and harder time interacting with other children. The fourth stage is "Industry (competence) vs. Inferiority". The basic virtue for this stage is competency which happens at the school age. This stage is when the child will try to win the approval of others and fit in and understand the value of their accomplishments. The fifth stage is "Identity vs. Role Confusion". The basic virtue gained is fidelity which takes place in adolescence. This is where the child will start to find who he/she is as a person in society. What sex role he/she picks. The sixth stage is "Intimacy vs. Isolation", which happens in young adults and the virtue gained is love. This is where the person will start to share his/her life with someone else intimately and emotionally. In not doing so, it could lead to isolation. The seventh stage is "Generativity vs. Stagnation". This happens in adulthood and the virtue gained would be care. We become stable and start to give back by raising a family and becoming involved in the community. The eighth stage is "Ego Integrity vs. Despair". This happens during maturity and wisdom is gained. When one grows old and they contemplate and look back and see the success or failure of their life. This is also the stage where one can also have closure and accept death without fearing anything.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|last=McLeod|first=Saul|title=Erik Erikson|url=http://www.simplypsychology.org/Erik-Erikson.html|year=2013|accessdate=23 July 2016|orig-year=2008|website=Simply Psychology}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Stages based on the model of hierarchical complexity===
{{Main|Model of hierarchical complexity}}
[[Michael Commons]] enhanced and simplified [[Bärbel Inhelder]] and Piaget's developmental theory and offers a standard method of examining the universal pattern of development. The Model of Hierarchical Complexity  (MHC) is not based on the assessment of domain-specific information, It divides the Order of Hierarchical Complexity of tasks to be addressed from the Stage performance on those tasks.  A stage is the order hierarchical complexity of the tasks the participant's successfully addresses. He expanded Piaget's original eight stage (counting the half stages) to fifteen stages. The stages are : 0 Calculatory; 1 Sensory &amp; Motor; 2 Circular sensory-motor; 3 Sensory-motor; 4 Nominal; 5 Sentential; 6 Preoperational; 7 Primary; 8 Concrete; 9 Abstract; 10 Formal; 11 Systematic; 12 Metasystematic; 13 Paradigmatic; 14 Cross-paradigmatic; 15 Meta-Cross-paradigmatic. The order of hierarchical complexity of tasks predicts how difficult the performance is with an R ranging from 0.9 to 0.98.

In the MHC, there are three main axioms for an order to meet in order for the higher order task to coordinate the next lower order task. Axioms are rules that are followed to determine how the MHC orders actions to form a hierarchy. These axioms are: a) defined in terms of tasks at the next lower order of hierarchical complexity task action; b) defined as the higher order task action that organizes two or more less complex actions; that is, the more complex action specifies the way in which the less complex actions combine; c) defined as the lower order task actions have to be carried out non-arbitrarily.

===Ecological systems theory===
{{Main|Ecological systems theory}}
[[File:Bronfenbrenner's_Ecological_Theory_of_Development_(English).jpg|link=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Bronfenbrenner's_Ecological_Theory_of_Development_(English).jpg|right|thumb|180x180px|{{center|Bronfenbrenner's ecological systems theory}}]]
Ecological systems theory, originally formulated by [[Urie Bronfenbrenner]], specifies four types of nested environmental systems, with bi-directional influences within and between the systems. The four systems are microsystem, mesosystem, exosystem, and macrosystem. Each system contains roles, norms and rules that can powerfully shape development. The microsystem is the direct environment in our lives such as our home and school. Mesosystem is how relationships connect to the microsystem. Exosystem is a larger social system where the child plays no role. Macrosystem refers to the cultural values, customs and laws of society.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://explorable.com/ecological-systems-theory|title=Ecological Systems Theory|website=Explorable Psychology Experiments|last1=Sincero|first1=Sarah Mae}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The microsystem is the immediate environment surrounding and influencing the individual (example: school or the home setting). The mesosystem is the combination of two microsystems and how they influence each other (example: sibling relationships at home vs. peer relationships at school). The exosystem is the interaction among two or more settings that are indirectly linked (example: a father's job requiring more overtime ends up influencing his daughter's performance in school because he can no longer help with her homework). The macrosystem is broader taking into account social economic status, culture, beliefs, customs and morals (example: a child from a wealthier family sees a peer from a less wealthy family as inferior for that reason). Lastly, the chronosystem refers to the chronological nature of life events and how they interact and change the individual and their circumstances through transition (example: a mother losing her own mother to illness and no longer having that support in her life).&lt;ref name="Edpsych24"/&gt;

Since its publication in 1979, Bronfenbrenner's major statement of this theory, ''The Ecology of Human Development''&lt;ref&gt;Bronfenbrenner, U. (1979). ''The Ecology of Human Development: Experiments by Nature and Design''. Cambridge, MA: Harvard University Press. ({{ISBN|0-674-22457-4}})&lt;/ref&gt; has had widespread influence on the way psychologists and others approach the study of human beings and their environments. As a result of this conceptualization of development, these environments—from the family to economic and political structures—have come to be viewed as part of the life course from childhood through to adulthood.&lt;ref name="Smith et al.2"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Understanding Children's Development|publisher=Blackwell|edition=4|series=Basic psychology|location=Oxford, England|author1=Smith, P.K.|author2=Cowie, H.|author3=Blades, M.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Zone of proximal development===
{{Main|Zone of proximal development}}
[[Lev Vygotsky]] was a Russian theorist from the Soviet era, who posited that children learn through hands-on experience and social interactions with members of his/her culture.&lt;ref&gt;Schacter, D. L., D. T. Gilbert, and D. M. Wegner. Psychology. 2. New York, NY: Worth Publishers, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;  Unlike Piaget, he claimed that timely and sensitive intervention by adults when a child is on the edge of learning a new task (called the "zone of proximal development") could help children learn new tasks. This adult role is often referred to as the skilled "master," whereas the child is considered the learning apprentice through an educational process often termed "[[cognitive apprenticeship]]" Martin Hill stated that "The world of reality does not apply to the mind of a child." This technique is called "scaffolding," because it builds upon knowledge children already have with new knowledge that adults can help the child learn.&lt;ref name="vygotsky782"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Mind in Society|publisher=Harvard University Press|year=1978|location=Cambridge, MA|author=Vygotsky, L.S.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Vygotsky was strongly focused on the role of culture in determining the child's pattern of development, arguing that development moves from the social level to the individual level.&lt;ref name="vygotsky782" /&gt; In other words, Vygotsky claimed that psychology should focus on the progress of human consciousness through the relationship of an individual and their environment.&lt;ref name="vygotsky20102"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Activity Systems Analysis Methods: Understanding Complex Learning Environments|publisher=Springer Science|year=2010|location=New York, NY|author=Yamagata-Lynch, L.C}}&lt;/ref&gt; He felt that if scholars continued to disregard this connection, then this disregard would inhibit the full comprehension of the human consciousness.&lt;ref name="vygotsky20102" /&gt;

===Constructivism===
{{Main|Constructivism (psychological school)}}
Constructivism is a paradigm in psychology that characterizes learning as a process of actively constructing knowledge. Individuals create meaning for themselves or make sense of new information by selecting, organizing, and integrating information with other knowledge, often in the context of social interactions.  Constructivism can occur in two ways: individual and social. Individual constructivism is when a person constructs knowledge through cognitive processes of their own experiences rather than by memorizing facts provided by others.  Social constructivism is when individuals construct knowledge through an interaction between the knowledge they bring to a situation and social or cultural exchanges within that content.&lt;ref name="Edpsych24"/&gt;

Jean Piaget, a Swiss developmental psychologist, proposed that learning is an active process because children learn through experience and make mistakes and solve problems. Piaget proposed that learning should be whole by helping students understand that meaning is constructed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://viking.coe.uh.edu/~ichen/ebook/et-it/cognitiv.htm|title=Overview of Cognitive Constructivism|website=Cognitive Constructivist Theories}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Evolutionary developmental psychology===
{{Main|Evolutionary developmental psychology}}

Evolutionary developmental psychology is a research paradigm that applies the basic principles of Darwinian [[evolution]], particularly [[natural selection]], to understand the development of human behavior and cognition. It involves the study of both the [[Genetics|genetic]] and environmental mechanisms that underlie the development of social and [[cognitive]] competencies, as well as the [[epigenetic]] ([[gene-environment interaction]]s) processes that adapt these competencies to local conditions.&lt;ref name="Bjorklund et al. 20142"&gt;{{cite book|title=The Handbook of Evolutionary Psychology|last2=Blasi|first2=Carlos Hernández|last3=Ellis|first3=Bruce J|isbn=978-1-118-75580-8|editor-link=|location=Volume 2|pages=905|chapter=Evolutionary Developmental Psychology|doi=|last1=Bjorklund|first1=David F|editor=David M.

EDP considers both the reliably developing, species-typical features of ontogeny (developmental adaptations), as well as [[Differential psychology|individual differences]] in behavior, from an evolutionary perspective. While evolutionary views tend to regard most individual differences as the result of either random genetic noise (evolutionary byproducts)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Tooby|first=John|date=1990|title=On the universality of human nature and the uniqueness of the individual: The role of genetics and adaptation|url=http://www.psych.ucsb.edu/research/cep/papers/jpersonality.pdf|journal=Journal of Personality|volume=58|issue=1|pages=17–67|doi=10.1111/j.1467-6494.1990.tb00907.x|pmid=2198338}}&lt;/ref&gt; and/or idiosyncrasies (for example, peer groups, education, neighborhoods, and chance encounters)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The blank slate|last=Pinker|first=Steven|publisher=Penguin Books|year=2002|isbn=|location=New York|pages=|chapter=Chapter 19: Children}}&lt;/ref&gt; rather than products of natural selection, EDP asserts that natural selection can favor the emergence of individual differences via "adaptive developmental plasticity."&lt;ref name="Bjorklund et al. 20142" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Developmental plasticity and evolution|last=West-Eberhard|first=Mary Jane|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2003|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; From this perspective, human development follows alternative life-history strategies in response to environmental variability, rather than following one species-typical pattern of development.&lt;ref name="Bjorklund et al. 20142" /&gt;

EDP is closely linked to the theoretical framework of [[evolutionary psychology]] (EP), but is also distinct from EP in several domains, including research emphasis (EDP focuses on adaptations of ontogeny, as opposed to adaptations of adulthood) and consideration of proximate ontogenetic and environmental factors (i.e., how development happens) in addition to more ultimate factors (i.e., why development happens), which are the focus of mainstream evolutionary psychology.&lt;ref name=":32"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Blasi|first=Carlos Hernandez|last2=Bjorklund|first2=David F.|date=2003|title=Evolutionary Developmental Psychology: A New Tool for Better Understanding Human Ontogeny|url=https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Carlos_Blasi/publication/275042203_Evolutionary_Developmental_Psychology_A_new_tool_for_better_understanding_human_ontogeny/links/553132e10cf27acb0dea90ec.pdf|journal=Human Development|volume=46|issue=5|pages=259–281|doi=10.1159/000071935|pmid=|access-date=March 31, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Attachment theory===
{{Main|Attachment theory}}
Attachment theory, originally developed by [[John Bowlby]], focuses on the importance of open, intimate, emotionally meaningful relationships.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;id=x-Oki9MxalQC&amp;oi=fnd&amp;pg=PA45|title=Attachment Theory: Social, Developmental, and Clinical Perspectives|last=Goldberg|first=Susan|last2=Muir|first2=Roy|last3=Kerr|first3=John|date=2013-04-15|publisher=Routledge|isbn=9781135890520}}&lt;/ref&gt; Attachment is described as a biological system or powerful survival impulse that evolved to ensure the survival of the infant. A child who is threatened or stressed will move toward caregivers who create a sense of physical, emotional and psychological safety for the individual. Attachment feeds on body contact and familiarity. Later [[Mary Ainsworth]] developed the [[Mary Ainsworth#Strange Situation|Strange Situation]] protocol and the concept of the secure base.

Theorists have proposed four types of attachment styles:&lt;ref name="Schacter4402"&gt;{{cite book|title=Psychology|last=Schacter, Gilbert, Wegner|publisher=Worth|year=2011|pages=440}}&lt;/ref&gt; secure, anxious-avoidant, anxious-resistant,&lt;ref name="Adolescence3"/&gt; and disorganized.&lt;ref name="Schacter4402" /&gt; Secure attachment is a healthy attachment between the infant and the caregiver. It is characterized by trust. Anxious-avoidant is an insecure attachment between an infant and a caregiver. This is characterized by the infant's indifference toward the caregiver. Anxious-resistant is an insecure attachment between the infant and the caregiver characterized by distress from the infant when separated and anger when reunited.&lt;ref name="Adolescence3" /&gt; Disorganized is an attachment style without a consistent pattern of responses upon return of the parent.&lt;ref name="Schacter4402" /&gt;

A child can be hindered in its natural tendency to form attachments. Some babies are raised without the stimulation and attention of a regular caregiver or locked away under conditions of abuse or extreme neglect. The possible short-term effects of this deprivation are anger, despair, detachment, and temporary delay in intellectual development. Long-term effects include increased aggression, clinging behavior, detachment, psychosomatic disorders, and an increased risk of depression as an adult.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Exploring Psychology|last=Myers|first=D.|publisher=Worth Publishers|year=2008|isbn=1-57259-096-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{page needed|date=August 2015}}&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=A Level Psychology Through Diagrams|last=Hill|first=G.|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2001|isbn=0-19-918094-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{page needed|date=August 2015}}

Attachment style can affect the relationships between people. Attachment is established in early childhood and attachment continues into adulthood. An example of secure attachment continuing in adulthood would be when the person feels confident and is able to meet their own needs. An example of anxious attachment during adulthood is when the adult chooses a partner with anxious-avoidant attachment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/compassion-matters/201307/how-your-attachment-style-impacts-your-relationship|title=How Your Attachment Style Impacts Your Relationship|website=Psychology Today|publisher=Compassion Matters|last1=Firestone|first1=Lisa}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Major debates==
{{Refimprove section|date=April 2017}}

===Nature vs nurture===
A significant issue in developmental psychology is the relationship between innateness and environmental influence in regard to any particular aspect of development. This is often referred to as "[[nature and nurture]]" or [[psychological nativism|nativism]] versus [[empiricism]]. A nativist account of development would argue that the processes in question are innate, that is, they are specified by the organism's [[genes]].

An empiricist perspective would argue that those processes are acquired in interaction with the environment. Today developmental psychologists rarely take such polarised positions with regard to most aspects of development; rather they investigate, among many other things, the relationship between innate and environmental influences. One of the ways this relationship has been explored in recent years is through the emerging field of [[evolutionary developmental psychology]].

One area where this innateness debate has been prominently portrayed is in research on [[language acquisition]]. A major question in this area is whether or not certain properties of human language are specified genetically or can be acquired through [[learning]]. The empiricist position on the issue of language acquisition suggests that the language input provides the necessary information required for learning the structure of language and that infants acquire language through a process of [[statistical learning]]. From this perspective, language can be acquired via general learning methods that also apply to other aspects of development, such as [[perceptual learning]].

The nativist position argues that the input from language is too impoverished for infants and children to acquire the structure of language. Linguist [[Noam Chomsky]] asserts that, evidenced by the lack of sufficient information in the language input, there is a [[universal grammar]] that applies to all human languages and is pre-specified. This has led to the idea that there is a special cognitive [[modularity of mind|module]] suited for learning language, often called the [[language acquisition device]]. Chomsky's critique of the behaviorist model of language acquisition is regarded by many as a key turning point in the decline in the prominence of the theory of behaviorism generally.&lt;ref name="Schlinger"&gt;{{Cite book |author=Schlinger, H.D. |year=2008 |title=The long good-bye: why B.F. Skinner's Verbal Behavior is alive and well on the 50th anniversary of its publication |journal=The Psychological Record}}&lt;/ref&gt; But Skinner's conception of "Verbal Behavior" has not died, perhaps in part because it has generated successful practical applications.&lt;ref name="Schlinger" /&gt;

===Continuity vs discontinuity===
Since theorists believe that development is a smooth, continuous process, individuals gradually add more of the same types of skills throughout their lives. Other theorists, however, think that development takes place in discontinuous stages. People change rapidly and step up to a new level, and then change very little for a while. With each new step, the person shows interest and responds to the world qualitatively.

===Stability vs change===
This issue involves the degree to which we become older renditions of our early experience or whether we develop into something different from who we were at an earlier point in development. It considers the extent to which early experiences ( especially infancy) or later experiences are the key determinants of a person's development.

Most lifespan developmentalists, recognise that extreme positions are unwise. Therefore, the key to a comprehensive understanding of development at any stage requires the ·interaction of different factors and not only one.

==Mechanisms of Development==
Developmental psychology is concerned not only with describing the characteristics of psychological change over time but also seeks to explain the principles and internal workings underlying these changes. Psychologists have attempted to better understand these factors by using [[model (abstract)|models]]. Developmental models are sometimes [[computer model|computational]], but they do not need to be.

A model must simply account for the means by which a process takes place. This is sometimes done in reference to changes in the [[human brain|brain]] that may correspond to changes in behavior over the course of the development. Computational accounts of development often use either [[symbol]]ic, [[connectionist]] ([[neural net]]work), or [[Cognitive Model#Dynamical systems|dynamical systems]] models to explain the Mechanisms of Development.

==Research areas==

===Cognitive development===
{{Main|Cognitive development|Theory of cognitive development|Neo-Piagetian theories of cognitive development}}
Cognitive development is primarily concerned with the ways that infants and children acquire, develop, and use internal mental capabilities such as: problem-solving, memory, and language. Major topics in cognitive development are the study of language acquisition and the development of perceptual and motor skills. Piaget was one of the influential early psychologists to study the development of cognitive abilities. His theory suggests that development proceeds through a set of stages from infancy to adulthood and that there is an end point or goal.

Other accounts, such as that of [[Lev Vygotsky]], have suggested that development does not progress through stages, but rather that the developmental process that begins at birth and continues until death is too complex for such structure and finality. Rather, from this viewpoint, developmental processes proceed more continuously. Thus, development should be analyzed, instead of treated as a product to obtain.

[[K. Warner Schaie]] has expanded the study of cognitive development into adulthood.  Rather than being stable from adolescence, Schaie sees adults as progressing in the application of their cognitive abilities.&lt;ref&gt;Schaie, K. W. (1990). Intellectual development in adulthood. In J. E. Birren &amp; K. W. Schaie (Eds.), Handbook of the psychology of aging, 3rd ed., (pp. 291-309). New York: Academic Press&lt;/ref&gt;

Modern cognitive development has integrated the considerations of [[cognitive psychology]] and the psychology of [[individual differences]] into the interpretation and modeling of development.&lt;ref name="demetriou"&gt;Demetriou, A. (1998). Cognitive development. In A. Demetriou, W. Doise, K.F.M. van Lieshout (Eds.), ''Life-span developmental psychology'' (pp. 179–269). London: Wiley.&lt;/ref&gt; Specifically, [[the neo-Piagetian theories of cognitive development]] showed that the successive levels or stages of cognitive development are associated with increasing processing efficiency and [[working memory]] capacity. These increases explain differences between stages, progression to higher stages, and individual differences of children who are the same-age and of the same grade-level. However, other theories have moved away from Piagetian stage theories, and are influenced by accounts of [[domain-specific]] information processing, which posit that development is guided by innate evolutionarily-specified and content-specific information processing mechanisms.

===Social and emotional development===
{{Main|Social-emotional development in childhood|Social psychology}}
Developmental psychologists who are interested in social development examine how individuals develop social and emotional competencies. For example, they study how children form friendships, how they understand and deal with emotions, and how identity develops. Research in this area may involve study of the relationship between cognition or cognitive development and social behavior.

[[Emotional self-regulation|Emotional regulation]] or ER refers to an individual's ability to modulate emotional responses across a variety of contexts. In young children, this modulation is in part controlled externally, by parents and other authority figures. As children develop, they take on more and more responsibility for their internal state. Studies have shown that the development of ER is affected by the emotional regulation children observe in parents and caretakers, the emotional climate in the home, and the reaction of parents and caretakers to the child's emotions.&lt;ref&gt;Amanda Morris et al. (2009) National Institute of Health. "The Role of the Family Context in Development of Emotion Regulation." pp 1-36 [http://www.saylor.org/site/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/PSYCH305-11.2.pdf] Retrieved May 21, 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

Music also has an influence on stimulating and enhancing the senses of a child through self-expression.&lt;ref&gt;Oaklander, Violet. (2006) Hidden Treasure : A Map to the Child's Inner Self. London,   Karnac Books.&lt;/ref&gt;

A child's social and emotional development can be disrupted by motor coordination problems as evidenced by the environmental stress hypothesis.  The environmental hypothesis explains how children with coordination problems and [[developmental coordination disorder]] are exposed to several psychosocial consequences which act as secondary stressors, leading to an increase in [[Internalizing disorder|internalizing symptoms]] such as depression and anxiety.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Cairney|first1=John|last2=Veldhuizen|first2=Scott|last3=Szatmari|first3=Peter|title=Motor coordination and emotional-behavioral problems in children|journal=Current Opinion in Psychiatry|date=2010|volume=23|pages=324–329|doi=10.1097/YCO.0b013e32833aa0aa}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Motor coordination problems affect fine and gross motor movement as well as perceptual-motor skills.  Secondary stressors commonly identified include the tendency for children with poor motor skills to be less likely to participate in organized play with other children and more likely to feel socially isolated.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA" /&gt;

Social and emotional development focuses on 5 keys areas: Self-Awareness, Self Management, Social Awareness, Relationship Skills and Responsible Decision Making.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = SEL Competencies|url = http://www.casel.org/social-and-emotional-learning/core-competencies|website = CASEL|accessdate = 2015-10-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Physical development===
Physical development concerns the physical maturation of an individual's body until it reaches the adult stature. Although physical growth is a highly regular process, all children differ tremendously in the timing of their growth spurts.&lt;ref name="Eaton"&gt;Eaton, Warren. "Physical Maturation", University of Manitoba, Winnipeg, Canada. Retrieved on 2012-03-16.&lt;/ref&gt; Studies are being done to analyze how the differences in these timings affect and are related to other variables of developmental psychology such as information processing speed. Traditional measures of physical maturity using x-rays are less in practice nowadays, compared to simple measurements of body parts such as height, weight, head circumference, and arm span.&lt;ref name="Eaton" /&gt;

A few other studies and practices with physical developmental psychology are the phonological abilities of mature 5- to 11-year-olds, and the controversial hypotheses of left-handers being maturationally delayed compared to right-handers. A study by Eaton, Chipperfield, Ritchot, and Kostiuk in 1996 found in three different samples that there was no difference between right- and left-handers.&lt;ref name="Eaton" /&gt;

===Memory development===
Researchers interested in memory development look at the way our memory develops from childhood and onward. According to [[Fuzzy-trace theory]], we have two separate memory processes: verbatim and gist. These two traces begin to develop at different times as well as at a different pace. Children as young as 4 years-old have verbatim memory, memory for surface information, which increases up to early adulthood, at which point it begins to decline. On the other hand, our capacity for gist memory, memory for semantic information, increases up to early adulthood, at which point it is consistent through old age. Furthermore, our reliance on gist memory traces increases as we age.&lt;ref name="Fuzzy-trace theory and children's false memories"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Brainerd|first=C.J.|author2=Reyna, V.F.|title=Fuzzy-trace theory and children's false memories|journal=Journal of Experimental Child Psychology|year=1998|volume=71|issue=2|pages=81–129|doi=10.1006/jcep.1998.2464}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Research methods and designs==

===Main research methods===
Developmental psychology employs many of the [[psychological research methods|research methods]] used in other areas of psychology. However, infants and children cannot be tested in the same ways as adults, so different methods are often used to study their development.

Developmental psychologists have a number of methods to study changes in individuals over time. Common research methods include systematic observation, including [[naturalistic observation]] or structured observation; self-reports, which could be clinical interviews or [[structured interviews]]; clinical or [[case study]] method; and [[ethnography]] or participant observation.&lt;ref name=Berk&gt;{{cite book |title=Infants and children: Prenatal through middle childhood |author=Laura E. Berk |edition=7 |year=2012 |publisher=Allyn &amp; Bacon }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|31–35}} These methods differ in the extent of control researchers impose on study conditions, and how they construct ideas about which variables to study.&lt;ref name=Bruning&gt;{{cite book|last=Bruning|first=David Moshman, John A. Glover, Roger H.|title=Developmental psychology : a topical approach|year=1987|publisher=Little, Brown|location=Boston|isbn=0-316-58561-0|pages=82–96}}&lt;/ref&gt; Every developmental investigation can be characterized in terms of whether its underlying strategy involves the ''experimental'', ''correlational'', or ''case study'' approach.&lt;ref name=Achenbach&gt;{{cite book|last=Achenbach|first=Thomas M.|title=Research in development psychology.|year=1978|publisher=Free Pr. [usw.]|location=New York [usw.]|isbn=0-02-900180-3|pages=74–104}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Prentice-Hall&gt;{{cite book|last=Marmor|first=Robert M. Liebert, Rita Wicks Poulos, Gloria Strauss|title=Developmental psychology|year=1977|publisher=Prentice-Hall|location=Englewood Cliffs, N.J.|isbn=0-13-208231-4|pages=20–37|edition=2d}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[experimental method]] involves "actual manipulation of various treatments, circumstances, or events to which the participant or subject is exposed;&lt;ref name=Prentice-Hall /&gt; the ''experimental design'' points to [[Causality|cause-and-effect relationships]].&lt;ref name=Shaffer&gt;{{cite book|last=Shaffer|first=David R.|title=Social and personality development|year=2009|publisher=Wadsworth|location=Australia|isbn=0-495-60038-5|pages=21–36|edition=6th}}&lt;/ref&gt; This method allows for strong inferences to be made of causal relationships between the manipulation of one or more [[independent variables]] and subsequent behavior, as measured by the [[dependent variable]].&lt;ref name=Prentice-Hall /&gt; The advantage of using this research method is that it permits determination of cause-and-effect relationships among variables.&lt;ref name=Shaffer /&gt; On the other hand, the limitation is that data obtained in an artificial environment may lack generalizability.&lt;ref name=Shaffer /&gt; The correlational method explores the relationship between two or more events by gathering information about these variables without researcher intervention.&lt;ref name=Prentice-Hall /&gt;&lt;ref name=Shaffer /&gt; The advantage of using a correlational design is that it estimates the strength and direction of relationships among variables in the natural environment;&lt;ref name=Shaffer /&gt; however, the limitation is that it does not permit determination of cause-and-effect relationships among variables.&lt;ref name=Shaffer /&gt; The [[case study]] approach allows investigations to obtain an in-depth understanding of an individual participant by collecting data based on [[interviews]], structured questionnaires, observations, and test scores.&lt;ref name=Shaffer /&gt; Each of these methods have its strengths and weaknesses but the experimental method when appropriate is the preferred method of developmental scientists because it provides a controlled situation and conclusions to be drawn about cause-and-effect relationships.&lt;ref name=Prentice-Hall /&gt;

===Research designs===
Most developmental studies, regardless of whether they employ the experimental, correlational, or case study method, can also be constructed using research designs.&lt;ref name=Bruning /&gt; Research designs are logical frameworks used to make key comparisons within research studies such as:
* [[cross-sectional design]]
* [[longitudinal design]]
* [[cohort study|sequential design]]
* [[microgenetic design]]

In a [[longitudinal study]], a researcher observes many individuals born at or around the same time (a [[cohort (statistics)|cohort]]) and carries out new observations as members of the cohort age. This method can be used to draw conclusions about which types of development are universal (or [[norm (sociology)|normative]]) and occur in most members of a cohort. As an example a longitudinal study of early literacy development examined in detail the early literacy experiences of one child in each of 30 families.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jweducation.com/PhDabstractsummary.html A Longitudinal Study of Early Literacy Development and the Changing Perceptions of Parents and Teachers], Dr John Worthington, 2001&lt;/ref&gt;

Researchers may also observe ways that development varies between individuals, and hypothesize about the causes of variation in their data. Longitudinal studies often require large amounts of time and funding, making them unfeasible in some situations. Also, because members of a cohort all experience historical events unique to their generation, apparently normative developmental trends may, in fact, be universal only to their cohort.&lt;ref name=Berk /&gt;{{rp|40}}

In a [[cross-sectional study]], a researcher observes differences between individuals of different ages at the same time. This generally requires fewer resources than the longitudinal method, and because the individuals come from different cohorts, shared historical events are not so much of a [[lurking variable|confounding factor]]. By the same token, however, cross-sectional research may not be the most effective way to study differences between participants, as these differences may result not from their different ages but from their exposure to ''different'' historical events.&lt;ref name=Berk /&gt;{{rp|41}}

A third study design, the [[cohort study|sequential design]], combines both methodologies. Here, a researcher observes members of different birth cohorts at the same time, and then tracks all participants over time, charting changes in the groups. While much more resource-intensive, the format aids in a clearer distinction between what changes can be attributed to an individual or historical environment from those that are truly universal.&lt;ref name=Berk /&gt;{{rp|42}}

Because every method has some weaknesses, developmental psychologists rarely rely on one study or even one method to reach conclusions by finding consistent evidence from as many converging sources as possible.&lt;ref name=Prentice-Hall /&gt;

==Life stages of psychological development==
&lt;!--THIS SECTION NEEDS WORK!--&gt;
{{See also|Child development stages}}

===Prenatal development===
{{Main|Prenatal development}}
{{See also|Fetal psychology}}
Prenatal development is of interest to psychologists investigating the context of early psychological development. The whole prenatal development involves three main stages: germinal stage, embryonic stage and fetal stage. Germinal stage begins at conception until 2 weeks; embryonic stage means the development from 2 weeks to 8 weeks; fetal stage represents 9 weeks until birth of the baby.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|first=K|last=Cherry|url=http://psychology.about.com/od/developmentalpsychology/a/prenataldevelop.htm|title=Stages of Prenatal Development|website=About Psychology}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{better source|date=May 2016}} The senses develop in the womb itself: a fetus can both see and hear by the second trimester (13 to 24 weeks of age). The sense of touch develops in the embryonic stage (5 to 8 weeks).&lt;ref name=Berk /&gt;{{rp|97}} Most of the brain's billions of neurons also are developed by the second trimester.&lt;ref name=Berk /&gt;{{rp|100}} Babies are hence born with some odor, taste and sound preferences, largely related to the mother's environment.&lt;ref name=Berk /&gt;{{rp|101}}

Some [[primitive reflexes]] too arise before birth and are still present in newborns. One hypothesis is that these reflexes are vestigial and have limited use in early human life. [[Piaget's theory of cognitive development]] suggested that some early reflexes are building blocks for infant sensorimotor development. For example, the [[tonic neck reflex]] may help development by bringing objects into the infant's field of view.&lt;ref name="butterworth"&gt;{{Cite book |last=Butterworth |first=G. |author2=Harris, M. |title=Principles of Developmental Psychology |year=1994 |publisher=Lawrence Erlbaum Associates |isbn=0-86377-280-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other reflexes, such as the [[walking reflex]] appear to be replaced by more sophisticated voluntary control later in infancy. This may be because the infant gains too much weight after birth to be strong enough to use the reflex, or because the reflex and subsequent development are functionally different.&lt;ref name="bremner"&gt;{{Cite book |last=Bremner |first=J.G. |title=Infancy |year=1994 |publisher=Blackwell |edition=2 |isbn=0-631-18466-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has also been suggested that some reflexes (for example the [[moro reflex|moro]] and [[walking reflex]]es) are predominantly adaptations to life in the womb with little connection to early infant development.&lt;ref name="butterworth" /&gt;  Primitive reflexes reappear in adults under certain conditions, such as neurological conditions like [[dementia]] or traumatic lesions.

[[Ultrasound]] has shown that infants are capable of a range of movements in the womb, many of which appear to be more than simple reflexes.&lt;ref name="bremner" /&gt; By the time they are born, infants can recognize and have a preference for their mother's voice suggesting some prenatal development of auditory perception.&lt;ref name="bremner" /&gt; Prenatal development and birth complications may also be connected to neurodevelopmental disorders, for example in [[schizophrenia]]. With the advent of [[cognitive neuroscience]], [[embryology]] and the neuroscience of prenatal development is of increasing interest to developmental psychology research.

Several environmental agents—[[teratogens]]—can cause damage during the prenatal period. These include prescription and nonprescription drugs, illegal drugs, tobacco, alcohol, environmental pollutants, infectious disease agents such as the [[rubella]] virus and the [[toxoplasmosis]] parasite, maternal malnutrition, maternal emotional stress, and Rh factor blood incompatibility between mother and child.&lt;ref name=Berk /&gt;{{rp|102–115}} There are many statistics which prove the effects of the aforementioned substances. A leading example of this would be that, in America alone, approximately 100,000-375,000 'cocaine babies' are born on an annual basis. This is a result of an expectant mother abusing the drug while pregnant. 'Cocaine babies' are proven to have quite severe and lasting difficulties which persist throughout infancy and right throughout childhood. The drug also encourages behavioural problems in the affected children, as well as defects of various vital organs.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title=One of five expectant mothers use cocaine, U.S. study finds|author=AP|work=Toronto star
|issn=0319-0781|date=1989-01-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Infancy===
{{Main|Infant and child psychology|Infant cognitive development}}
From birth until the first year, the child is referred to as an [[infant]].&lt;ref name=Berk /&gt; Developmental psychologists vary widely in their assessment of infant psychology, and the influence the outside world has upon it, but certain aspects are relatively clear.

The majority of a newborn infant's time is spent in sleep. At first, this sleep is evenly spread throughout the day and night, but after a couple of months, infants generally become [[diurnal animal|diurnal]].

Infants can be seen to have six states, grouped into pairs:
* quiet sleep and active sleep ([[dream]]ing, when [[REM sleep]] occurs)
* quiet waking, and active waking
* fussing and [[crying]]

====Infant perception====
Infant perception is what a newborn can see, hear, smell, taste, and touch.  These five features are better known as one's "five senses".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Bee |first=Denise Boyd, Helen |title=The developing child |publisher=Pearson Education |location=Upper Saddle River, N.J. |isbn=978-0-205-25602-0 |page=36 |edition=13th}}&lt;/ref&gt; Infants respond to stimuli differently in these different states.&lt;ref name="bremner" /&gt;

* [[Visual perception|Vision]] is significantly worse in infants than in older children. Infant sight tends to be blurry in early stages but improves over time. Color perception similar to that seen in adults has been demonstrated in infants as young as four months, using habituation methods.&lt;ref name="butterworth" /&gt; Infants get to adult-like vision in about six months.&lt;ref name="Berk" /&gt;{{rp|191}}
* [[Hearing (sense)|Hearing]] is well-developed prior to birth, unlike vision. Newborns prefer complex sounds to pure tones, human speech to other sounds, mother's voice to other voices, and the native language to other languages. Scientist believe these features are probably learned in the womb.&lt;ref name="Berk" /&gt;{{rp|151}} Infants are fairly good at detecting the direction a sound comes from, and by 18 months their hearing ability is approximately equal to an adult's.
* [[Olfaction|Smell]] and [[taste]] are present, with infants showing different expressions of disgust or pleasure when presented with pleasant odors (honey, milk, etc.) or unpleasant odors (rotten egg) and tastes (e.g. sour taste). Newborns are born with odor and taste preferences acquired in the womb from the smell and taste of amniotic fluid, in turn influenced by what the mother eats. Both breast- and bottle-fed babies around 3 days old prefer the smell of human milk to that of formula, indicating an innate preference.&lt;ref name="Berk" /&gt;{{rp|150}} There is good evidence for older infants preferring the smell of their mother to that of others.&lt;ref name="butterworth" /&gt;

====Language====
{{Main|Language development}}
Babies are born with the ability to discriminate virtually all sounds of all human languages.&lt;ref name=Berk /&gt;{{rp|189}} Infants of around six months can differentiate between [[phoneme]]s in their own language, but not between similar phonemes in another language. At this stage infants also start to [[Babbling|babble]], producing phonemes.

====Infant cognition: the Piagetian era====
Piaget suggested that an infant's perception and understanding of the world depended on their motor development, which was required for the infant to link visual, tactile and motor representations of objects.&lt;ref&gt;Lefmann, T. &amp; Combs-Orme, T. 2013, "Early Brain Development for Social Work Practice: Integrating Neuroscience with Piaget's Theory of Cognitive Development", Journal of Human Behavior in the Social Environment, vol. 23, no. 5, pp. 640-647.&lt;/ref&gt; According to this view, it is through touching and handling objects that infants develop [[object permanence]], the understanding that objects are solid, permanent, and continue to exist when out of sight.&lt;ref name="bremner" /&gt;

[[File:Baby.jpg|thumb|200px|Special methods are used in the psychological study of infants.]]
Piaget's sensorimotor stage comprised six sub-stages (see [[Theory of cognitive development#Sensorimotor period|sensorimotor stages]] for more detail). In the early stages, development arises out of movements caused by [[primitive reflexes]].&lt;ref name="Gruber"&gt;{{Cite book |last=Piaget |first=J. |year=1977 |title=The essential Piaget |editor-first=H.E. |editor-last=Gruber |editor2-first=J.J. |editor2-last=Voneche |location=New York |publisher=Basic Books |isbn=0-7100-8778-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; Discovery of new behaviors results from [[classical conditioning|classical]] and [[operant conditioning]], and the formation of [[habit (psychology)|habits]].&lt;ref name="Gruber" /&gt; From eight months the infant is able to uncover a hidden object but will persevere when the object is moved.

Piaget came to his conclusion that infants lacked a complete understanding of object permanence before 18 months after observing infants' failure before this age to look for an object where it was last seen. Instead, infants continue to look for an object where it was first seen, committing the "[[A-not-B error]]." Some researchers have suggested that before the age of eight to nine months, infants' inability to understand object permanence extends to people, which explains why infants at this age do not cry when their mothers are gone ("Out of sight, out of mind").

====Recent findings in infant cognition====
In the 1980s and 1990s, researchers have developed many new methods of assessing infants' understanding of the world with far more precision and subtlety than Piaget was able to do in his time. Since then, many studies based on these methods suggest that young infants understand far more about the world than first thought.

Based on recent findings, some researchers (such as [[Elizabeth Spelke]] and [[Renee Baillargeon]]) have proposed that an understanding of object permanence is not learned at all, but rather comprises part of the innate cognitive capacities of our species.

Other research has suggested that young infants in their first six months of life may possess an understanding of numerous aspects of the world around them, including:

* an early [[numerical cognition]], that is, an ability to represent number and even compute the outcomes of addition and subtraction operations;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Wynn |first1=Karen |authorlink1=Karen Wynn |year=1992  |title=Addition and subtraction by human infants |journal=[[Nature (journal)|Nature]] |volume=358 |issue= 6389|pages=749–750 |publisher= |doi= 10.1038/358749a0|url=http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v358/n6389/abs/358749a0.html |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* an ability to infer the goals of people in their environment;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | year = 1998 | title = Infants selectively encode the goal object of an actor's reach | url = | journal = Cognition | volume =  69| issue = | pages =  1–34| doi = 10.1016/S0010-0277(98)00058-4  | last1 = Woodward | first1 = A}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* an ability to engage in simple causal reasoning.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Leslie | first1 = A. | last2 = Keeble | first2 = S. | year = 1987 | title = Do six-month-old infants perceive causality?| url = | journal = Cognition | volume = 25 | issue = | pages = 265–288 | doi = 10.1016/S0010-0277(87)80006-9 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Critical periods of development====
There are [[critical period]]s in infancy and childhood during which development of certain perceptual, sensorimotor, social and language systems depends crucially on environmental stimulation.&lt;ref name="Siegler"&gt;{{Cite book |last=Siegler |first=Robert |year=2006 |title=How Children Develop, Exploring Child Development Student Media Tool Kit &amp; Scientific American Reader to Accompany How Children Develop |location=New York |publisher=Worth Publishers |isbn=0-7167-6113-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Feral child]]ren such as [[Genie (feral child)|Genie]], deprived of adequate stimulation, fail to acquire important skills and are unable to learn in later childhood. The concept of critical periods is also well-established in [[neurophysiology]], from the work of [[Hubel]] and [[Torsten Wiesel|Wiesel]] among others.

====Developmental delays====
Children with developmental delays (DD) are at heightened risk for developing clinically significant behavioral and emotional difficulties as compared to children with typical development (TD). However, nearly all studies comparing psychopathology in youth with DD employ TD control groups of the same chronological age (CA).This comorbidity of DD and a mental disorder is often referred to as dual diagnosis. Epidemiological studies indicate that 30–50% of youth with DD meet the clinical cutoff for behavioral and emotional problems and/or diagnosable mental disorder. Studies that include comparison samples of children with typical development (TD) highlight the considerable difference in risk for psychopathology, with the relative risk for youth with DD (to youth with TD) ranging from 2.8–4.1 to 1.{{citation needed|date=November 2016}}

===Toddler-hood===
{{Main|Toddler}}
Infants shift between ages of one and two to a developmental stage known as toddlerhood. In this stage, an infant's transition into toddlerhood is highlighted through self-awareness, developing maturity in language use, and presence of memory and imagination.

During toddlerhood, babies begin learning how to [[Walking|walk]], talk, and make decisions for themselves. An important characteristic of this age period is the [[Language development|development of language]], where children are learning how to communicate and express their emotions and desires through the use of vocal sounds, babbling, and eventually words.&lt;ref name=Upton&gt;{{cite book|last=Upton|first=Penney|title=Developmental Psychology: Critical Thinking in Psychology|year=2011|publisher=Learning Matters|location=Exeter|isbn=0-85725-276-3|page=62}}&lt;/ref&gt; Self-control also begins to develop. At this age, children take initiative to explore, experiment and learn from making mistakes. Caretakers who encourage toddlers to try new things and test their limits, help the child become autonomous, self-reliant, and confident.&lt;ref name=ToddlerPlay&gt;{{cite book|last=Massi|first=Wendy S.|title=Toddler Play|year=2001|publisher=Creative Pub. international|isbn=0-86573-435-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; If the caretaker is overprotective or disapproving of independent actions, the toddler may begin to doubt their abilities and feel ashamed of the desire for independence. The child's autonomic development is inhibited, leaving them less prepared to deal with the world in the future. Toddlers also begin to identify themselves in [[gender role]]s, acting according to their perception of what a man or woman should do.&lt;ref name=UPton&gt;{{cite book|last=Upton|first=Penney|title=Developmental Psychology: Critical Thinking in Psychology|year=2011|publisher=Learning Matters|location=Exeter|isbn=0-85725-276-3|page=84}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Socially, the period of toddler-hood is commonly called the "terrible twos".&lt;ref name=Newman&gt;{{cite book|last=Newman|first=Barbara M.|title=Development Through Life : A Psychosocial Approach|year=2011|publisher=Wadsworth Cengage Learning|location=Belmont, CA|isbn=1-111-34468-X|pages=215–217|author2=Newman, P. R.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Toddlers often use their new-found language abilities to voice their desires, but are often misunderstood by parents due to their language skills just beginning to develop.  A person at this stage testing their independence is another reason behind the stage's infamous label. Tantrums in a fit of frustration are also common.

===Childhood===
{{See also|Early childhood}}
[[Erik Erikson]] divides childhood into four stages, each with its distinct social crisis:&lt;ref name="Bernardo J. Carducci 2009"&gt;Bernardo J. Carducci, ''The Psychology of Personality: Viewpoints, Research, and Applications'' (John Wiley &amp; Sons, 2009), 189.&lt;/ref&gt;
:* Stage 1: [[Infancy]] (0 to 1½) in which the psychosocial crisis is Trust vs. Mistrust
:* Stage 2: Early childhood (2½ to 3) in which the psychosocial crisis is Autonomy vs. Shame and doubt
:* Stage 3: Play age (3 to 5) in which the psychosocial crisis is Initiative vs. Guilt. (This stage is also called the "pre-school age," "exploratory age" and "toy age."&lt;ref&gt;Vardhaman I.Q. Toys, "Vision," http://www.vardhamaniqtoys.com/vision.aspx&lt;/ref&gt;)
:* Stage 4: School age (5 to 12) in which the psychosocial crisis is Industry vs. Inferiority

'''Play (or preschool) ages 3–5.'''&lt;br /&gt;
In the earliest years, children are "completely dependent on the care of others." Therefore, they develop a "social relationship" with their care givers and, later, with family members. During their preschool years (3-5), they "enlarge their social horizons" to include people outside the family.&lt;ref&gt;Arland Thornton, ''The Well-being of Children and Families: Research and Data Needs'' (University of Michigan Press, 2001), 73-74.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Cognitive development#Preoperational stage|Preoperational]] and then [[Cognitive development#Concrete operational stage|operational]] thinking develops, which means actions are reversible, and egocentric thought diminishes.&lt;ref&gt;Cynthia Lightfoot, Michael Cole, Sheila R. Cole, ''The Development of Children'' (Macmillan, 2008), 275-277.&lt;/ref&gt;

The motor skills of preschoolers increase so they can do more things for themselves. They become more independent. No longer completely dependent on the care of others, the world of this age group expands. More people have a role in shaping their individual personalities. Preschoolers explore and question their world.&lt;ref&gt;Centers for Disease Control, "Child Development: Preschoolers (3-5 years of age)" online at https://www.cdc.gov/ncbddd/childdevelopment/positiveparenting/preschoolers.html&lt;/ref&gt; For [[Jean Piaget]], the child is "''a little scientist'' exploring and reflecting on these explorations to increase competence" and this is done in "a very independent way."&lt;ref&gt;Ann Marie Halpenny, Jan Pettersen, ''Introducing Piaget: A Guide for Practitioners and Students in Early Years Education'' (Routledge, 2013), 7, 9.&lt;/ref&gt;

Play is a major activity for ages 3–5. For Piaget, through play "a child reaches higher levels of cognitive development."&lt;ref&gt;Ann Marie Halpenny, Jan Pettersen, ''Introducing Piaget: A Guide for Practitioners and Students in Early Years Education'' (Routledge, 2013), 14.&lt;/ref&gt;

In their expanded world, children in the 3-5 age group attempt to find their own way. If this is done in a socially acceptable way, the child develops the initiative. If not, the child develops guilt.&lt;ref&gt;Bob O'Connor, Christine Wells, Trent Applegate, ''Health: You and Your World Volume 1: Brief Edition'' (CreateSpace Independent Publishing Platform, 2015), 28.&lt;/ref&gt; Children who develop "guilt" rather than "initiative" have failed Erikson's psychosocial crisis for the 3-5 age group.

'''Middle childhood ages 6–12.'''&lt;br /&gt;
For Erik Erikson, the psychosocial crisis during middle childhood is Industry vs. Inferiority which, if successfully met, instills a sense of Competency in the child.&lt;ref name="Bernardo J. Carducci 2009" /&gt;

In all cultures, middle childhood is a time for developing "skills that will be needed in their society."&lt;ref name="Barbara Engler 2013"&gt;Barbara Engler, ''Personality Theories, 9th edition'' (Cengage Learning, 2013), 142.&lt;/ref&gt; School offers an arena in which children can gain a view of themselves as "industrious (and worthy)." They are "graded for their school work and often for their industry." They can also develop industry outside of school in sports, games, and doing volunteer work.&lt;ref name="Marc H. Bornstein 2010"&gt;Marc H. Bornstein, Deborah Lowe Vandell, Karen S. Rook, ''Lifespan Development: Infancy Through Adulthood'' (Cengage Learning, 2010), 299.&lt;/ref&gt; Children who achieve "success in school or games might develop a feeling of competence."

The "peril during this period is that feelings of inadequacy and inferiority will develop.&lt;ref name="Barbara Engler 2013" /&gt; Parents and teachers can "undermine" a child's development by failing to recognize accomplishments or being overly critical of a child's efforts.&lt;ref name="Marc H. Bornstein 2010" /&gt;
Children who are "encouraged and praised" develop a belief in their competence. Lack of encouragement or ability to excel lead to "feelings of inadequacy and inferiority".&lt;ref&gt;Megan Broutian, Milestones, "Your child: early school years (7 to 11 years) stage of development" in ''Your Child's Development'' online at http://behavioralchild.com/milestones/. Accessed October 13, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Centers for Disease Control]] (the CDC) divides Middle Childhood into two stages, 6–8 years and 9–11 years, and gives "developmental milestones for each stage."&lt;ref&gt;Centers for Disease Control, "Child Development: Middle Childhood (6-8 years of age)" online at https://www.cdc.gov/ncbddd/childdevelopment/positiveparenting/middle.html and Centers for Disease Control, "Child Development: Middle Childhood (9-11 years of age)" online at https://www.cdc.gov/ncbddd/childdevelopment/positiveparenting/middle2.html. Both accessed October 15, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

''Middle Childhood (7-10).''&lt;br /&gt;
Entering elementary school, children in this age group begin to thinks about the future and their "place in the world." Working with other students and wanting their friendship and acceptance become more important. This leads to "more independence from parents and family." As students, they develop the mental and verbal skills "to describe experiences and talk about thoughts and feelings". They become less self-centered and show "more concern for others".&lt;ref&gt;Centers for Disease Control, "Child Development: Middle Childhood (6-8 years of age)" online at https://www.cdc.gov/ncbddd/childdevelopment/positiveparenting/middle.html. Accessed October 15, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

''Middle Childhood (9-11).''&lt;br /&gt;
For children ages 9–11 "friendships and peer relationships" increase in strength, complexity, and importance. This results in greater "peer pressure." They grow even less dependent on their families and they are challenged academically. To meet this challenge, they increase their attention span and learn to see other points of view.&lt;ref&gt;Centers for Disease Control, "Child Development: Middle Childhood (6-8 years of age)" online at https://www.cdc.gov/ncbddd/childdevelopment/positiveparenting/middle2.html. Accessed October 15, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Adolescence===
{{Main|Adolescent psychology}}
Adolescence is the period of life between the onset of puberty and the full commitment to an adult social role, such as worker, parent, and/or citizen. It is the period known for the formation of personal and social identity (see [[Erik Erikson]]) and the discovery of moral purpose (see [[William Damon]]). Intelligence is demonstrated through the logical use of symbols related to abstract concepts and formal reasoning. A return to [[egocentric]] thought often occurs early in the period. Only 35% develop the capacity to reason formally during adolescence or adulthood. (Huitt, W. and Hummel, J. January 1998)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.uoregon.edu/~moursund/Math/developmental_theory.htm|title=Developmental Theory|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is divided into three parts, namely:
# Early Adolescence: 9 to 13 years 
# Mid Adolescence: 13 to 15 years and
# Late Adolescence: 15 to 18 years

The adolescent unconsciously explores questions such as "Who am I? Who do I want to be?" Like toddlers, adolescents must explore, test limits, become [[autonomous]], and commit to an [[identity (social science)|identity]], or [[sense of self]]. Different roles, behaviors and [[ideologies]] must be tried out to select an identity. Role confusion and inability to choose vocation can result from a failure to achieve a sense of identity through, for example, friends.

===Early adulthood===
{{Main|Young adult (psychology)}}
Early adulthood generally refers to the period between ages 18 to 25, and according to theorists such as Erik Erikson, is a stage where development is mainly focused on [[Interpersonal relationship|maintaining relationships]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Kastenbaum|first=Robert|title=Encyclopedia of Adult Development|year=1993|publisher=Oryx Press|isbn=0-89774-669-4|page=14}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Examples include creating bond of intimacy, sustaining friendships, and ultimately making a family. Some theorists state that development of intimacy skills rely on the resolution of previous developmental stages. A sense of identity gained in the previous stages is also necessary for intimacy to develop. If this skill is not learned the alternative is alienation, isolation, a fear of commitment, and the inability to depend on others.

A related framework for studying this part of the lifespan is that of [[emerging adulthood]]. Scholars of emerging adulthood, such as Jeffrey Arnett, are not necessarily interested in relationship development. Instead, this concept suggests that people transition after their teenage years into a period not characterized as relationship building and an overall sense of constancy with life, but with years of living with parents, phases of self-discovery, and experimentation.&lt;ref name=Twenge&gt;{{cite journal|last=Twenge|first=Jean M.|title=Review of emerging adulthood: The winding road from the late teens through the twenties|journal=American Journal of Psychology|year=2008|volume=121|issue=4|pages=682–687}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Middle adulthood===
{{Main|Middle age}}
Middle adulthood generally refers to the period between ages 25 to 69. During this period, middle-aged adults experience a conflict between generativity and stagnation. They may either feel a sense of contributing to society, the next generation, or their immediate community; or develop a sense of purposelessness.

Physically, the middle-aged experience a decline in muscular strength, reaction time, sensory keenness, and cardiac output. Also, women experience [[menopause]] and a sharp drop in the hormone [[estrogen]]. Men experience an equivalent endocrine system event to menopause. [[Andropause]] in males is a hormone fluctuation with physical and psychological effects that can be similar to those seen in menopausal females. As men age lowered testosterone levels can contribute to mood swings and a decline in [[spermatozoa|sperm]] count. Sexual responsiveness can also be affected, including delays in [[erection]] and longer periods of [[penile stimulation]] required to achieve [[ejaculation]].

===Old age===
{{Main|Old age}}

The [[World Health Organization]] finds "no general agreement on the age at which a person becomes old." Most [[Developed country|"developed countries"]] set the age as 60 or 65. However, in [[Developing country|developing countries]] inability to make "active contribution" to society, not chronological age, marks the beginning of old age.&lt;ref&gt;"Definition of an older or elderly person" on World Health Organization website at http://www.who.int/healthinfo/survey/ageingdefnolder/en/. Accessed October 11, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[Erikson's stages of psychosocial development]], old age is the stage in which individuals assess the quality of their lives. In reflecting on their lives, people in this age group develop a feeling of integrity if deciding that their lives were successful or a feeling of despair if evaluation of one's life indicates a failure to achieve goals.&lt;ref name="Miller2003"&gt;{{cite book|author=Julia R. Miller|title=Encyclopedia of Human Ecology: I-Z|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=rPcwuEe9MBQC&amp;pg=PA242|accessdate=4 December 2012|year=2003|publisher=ABC-CLIO|isbn=978-1-57607-852-5|pages=242–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Physically, older people experience a decline in muscular strength, reaction time, stamina, hearing, distance perception, and the sense of smell.&lt;ref name="Deary2011"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Deary | first1 = I.

Sexual expression depends in large part upon the emotional and physical health of the individual. Many older adults continue to be sexually active and satisfied with their sexual activity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Blanchard-Fields|first=John C.

Mental [[wikt:disintegration|disintegration]] may also occur, leading to [[dementia]] or ailments such as [[Alzheimer's disease]]. It is generally believed that [[crystallized intelligence]] increases up to old age, while [[fluid intelligence]] decreases with age.&lt;ref&gt;Woolf, Linda M.

==Parenting==
Parenting variables alone have typically accounted for 20 to 50 percent of the variance in child outcomes.&lt;ref name=Flaherty&gt;{{cite journal|last=Flaherty|first=Serena Cherry|author2=Sadler, Lois S.|title=A Review of Attachment Theory in the Context of Adolescent Parenting|journal=Journal of Pediatric Health Care|date=1 March 2011|volume=25|issue=2|pages=114–121|doi=10.1016/j.pedhc.2010.02.005|pmc=3051370|pmid=21320683}}&lt;/ref&gt;

All parents have their own parenting styles. Parenting styles, according to [https://www.human.cornell.edu/people/kak33 Kimberly Kopko], are "based upon two aspects of parenting behavior; control and warmth. Parental control refers to the degree to which parents manage their children's behavior. Parental warmth refers to the degree to which parents are accepting and responsive to their children's behavior."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Kopoko|first1=Kimberly|title=Parenting Styles and Adolescents|journal=Cornell University Cooperative Extension|date=2007|pages=1–8|url=http://www.human.cornell.edu/pam/outreach/parenting/research/upload/Parenting-20Styles-20and-20Adolescents.pdf|accessdate=20 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Parenting styles===
The following [[parenting styles]] have been described in the child development literature:

* Authoritative parenting is characterized as parents who have high parental warmth, responsiveness, and demandingness, but rate low in negativity and conflict.&lt;ref name=Taylor&gt;{{cite journal|last=Taylor|first=Lorraine C.|author2=Clayton, Jennifer D. |author3=Rowley, Stephanie J. |title=Academic Socialization: Understanding Parental Influences on Children's School-Related Development in the Early Years.|journal=Review of General Psychology|date=1 January 2004|volume=8|issue=3|pages=163–178|doi=10.1037/1089-2680.8.3.163}}&lt;/ref&gt; These parents are assertive but not intrusive or overly restrictive.&lt;ref name=Baumrind&gt;{{cite journal|last=Baumrind|first=D.|title=The Influence of Parenting Style on Adolescent Competence and Substance Use|journal=The Journal of Early Adolescence|date=1 February 1991|volume=11|issue=1|pages=56–95|doi=10.1177/0272431691111004}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This method of parenting is associated with more positive social and academic outcomes. The beneficial outcomes of authoritative parenting are not necessarily universal. Among African American adolescents, authoritative parenting is not associated with academic achievement without peer support for achievement.&lt;ref name=Taylor /&gt; Children who are raised by authoritative parents are "more likely to become independent, self-reliant, socially accepted, academically successful, and well-behaved. They are less likely to report depression and anxiety, and less likely to engage in antisocial behavior like delinquency and drug use."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Dewar PHD|first1=Gwen|title=The authoritative parenting style: Warmth, rationality, and high standards." A guide for the science-minded parent|url=http://www.parentingscience.com/authoritative-parenting-style.html|website=Parenting Science|accessdate=20 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Authoritarian parenting is characterized by low levels of warmth and responsiveness with high levels of demandingness and firm control.&lt;ref name=Taylor /&gt; These parents focus on obedience and they monitor their children regularly.&lt;ref name=Baumrind /&gt; In general, this style of parenting is associated with maladaptive outcomes.  The outcomes are more harmful for middle class boys than girls, preschool white girls than preschool black girls, and for white boys than Hispanic boys.&lt;ref name=Baumrind /&gt; Furthermore, the negative effects of authoritarian parenting among Asian Americans can be offset by positive peer support.&lt;ref name=Taylor /&gt; Finally, among African Americans, some elements of authoritarian parenting such as firm control and physical discipline do not serve as predictive factors for negative outcomes.&lt;ref name=Taylor /&gt;
* Permissive parenting is characterized by high levels of responsiveness combined with low levels of demandingness.&lt;ref name=Baumrind /&gt; These parents are lenient and do not necessarily require mature behavior.&lt;ref name=Baumrind /&gt;  They allow for a high degree of self-regulation and typically avoid confrontation.&lt;ref name=Baumrind /&gt;  Compared to children raised using the authoritative style, preschool girls raised in permissive families are less assertive.&lt;ref name=Baumrind /&gt;  Additionally, preschool children of both sexes are less cognitively competent than those children raised under authoritative parenting styles.&lt;ref name=Baumrind /&gt;
* Rejecting or neglectful parenting is the final category. This is characterized by low levels of demandingness and responsiveness. These parents are typically disengaged in their child's lives, lacking structure in their parenting styles and are unsupportive.&lt;ref name=Baumrind /&gt;  Children in this category are typically the least competent of all the categories.&lt;ref name=Baumrind /&gt;

===Mother and father factors===
Parenting roles in child development have typically focused on the role of the mother. Recent literature, however, has looked toward the father as having an important role in child development.  Affirming a role for fathers, studies have shown that children as young as 15 months benefit significantly from substantial engagement with their father.&lt;ref name="aredos"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ericdigests.org/2004-3/role.html|title=Fathers' Role in Children's Academic Achievement and Early Literacy. ERIC Digest.|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Children with active, involved fathers have better social skills, are healthier, and do better in school", according to Duane Wilson, the Proud Fathers, Proud Parents program coordinator for the Michigan Department of Human Services (http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=-2125328669291708941 2:57)&lt;/ref&gt; In particular, a study in the U.S. and New Zealand found the presence of the natural father was the most significant factor in reducing rates of early sexual activity and rates of teenage pregnancy in girls.&lt;ref&gt;Bruce J. Ellis, Child Development May/June 2003, 74:3, pp. 801–21&lt;/ref&gt;  Furthermore, another argument is that neither a mother nor a father is actually essential in successful parenting, and that single parents as well as homosexual couples can support positive child outcomes.&lt;ref name=Silverstein&gt;{{cite journal|last=Silverstein|first=Louise|author2=Carl Auerbach|title=Deconstructing the Essential Father|journal=American Psychologist|year=1999|volume=54|pages=397–407|doi=10.1037/0003-066x.54.6.397}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to this set of research, children need at least one consistently responsible adult with whom the child can have a positive emotional connection. Having more than one of these figures contributes to a higher likelihood of positive child outcomes.&lt;ref name=Silverstein /&gt;

===Divorce===
Another parental factor often debated in terms of its effects on child development is divorce.  Divorce in itself is not a determining factor of negative child outcomes. In fact, the majority of children from divorcing families fall into the normal range on measures of psychological and cognitive functioning.&lt;ref name=Whiteside&gt;{{cite journal|last=Whiteside|first=Mary F.|author2=Becker, Betsy Jane|title=Parental factors and the young child's postdivorce adjustment: A meta-analysis with implications for parenting arrangements.|journal=Journal of Family Psychology|date=1 January 2000|volume=14|issue=1|pages=5–26|doi=10.1037/0893-3200.14.1.5}}&lt;/ref&gt; A number of mediating factors play a role in determining the effects divorce has on a child, for example, divorcing families with young children often face harsher consequences in terms of demographic, social, and economic changes than do families with older children.&lt;ref name=Whiteside /&gt; Positive coparenting after divorce is part of a pattern associated with positive child coping, while hostile parenting behaviors lead to a destructive pattern leaving children at risk.&lt;ref name=Whiteside /&gt; Additionally, direct parental relationship with the child also affects the development of a child after a divorce.  Overall, protective factors facilitating positive child development after a divorce are maternal warmth, positive father-child relationship, and cooperation between parents.&lt;ref name=Whiteside /&gt;

==Headquarters and Global Farm==
ECHO is headquartered in [[North Fort Myers]], Florida. Its campus includes the "Global Farm and Research Center" a demonstration and research farm, a reference library with a variety of resources about rare agricultural crops and techniques,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.naplesnews.com/community/bonita-banner/bonita-middle-students-learn-ropes-self-sustained- "Bonita Middle students learn the ropes of self-sustained farming"]. KELLY O'NEIL , ''The Banner''. May 17, 2009&lt;/ref&gt; a seed bank, a tropical fruit nursery with a large collection of [[bamboo]] varieties, and a bookstore. The global farm also includes an [[appropriate technology]] center developing tools and equipment for small scale farmers.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.treehugger.com/green-food/5-super-simple-ways-to-get-your-urban-garden-going.html "5 Super Simple Ways to Get Your Urban Garden Going"]. ''Treehugger'', A.K.

''Fremont Tribune'', September 8, 2013 By Carolyn Gibbs.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Regional Impact Centers==
ECHO operates four Regional Impact Centers to bring agricultural resources to  small-scale farmers  in the areas surrounding [[Chiang Mai]], Thailand, [[Arusha]], Tanzania,&lt;ref&gt;[http://newstaar.com/earth-day-15-recommendations-using-agriculture-to-address-environmental-issues/353153/ "Earth Day: 15 Recommendations Using Agriculture to Address Environmental Issues"]. ''NewStaar Media'',  D Robert Curry, April 22, 2011&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Ouagadougou]], Burkina Faso, with a long-term research project in soil science based near [[Modimolle]], South Africa.

==Seed distribution==
ECHO maintains a collection of useful tropical trees and other plants and provides seed and cuttings,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.goodfoodworld.com/2012/03/chaya-mayan-tree-spinach-cabbage-star/ "Chaya - Mayan Tree-Spinach, Cabbage Star"]. ''GoodFood World'', Arthur Lee Jacobson, March 20th, 2012&lt;/ref&gt; free of charge, to individuals actively involved in development abroad, with the intention that seeds will be harvested from the resulting crops and distributed in the communities.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bradenton.com/2014/12/10/5523056_usf-hospitality-students-use-lakewood.html?rh=1 "USF hospitality students use Lakewood Ranch community garden to enhance learning"].''Bradenton Herald'', By CLAIRE ARONSON December 10, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.baynews9.com/content/news/baynews9/news/article.html/content/news/articles/bn9/2014/6/26/anna_maria_garden.html "Anna Maria Island garden project growing, raising awareness"]. ''Bay News 9'',  Summer Smith, June 28, 2014,&lt;/ref&gt;  For example, ECHO disseminates seeds and information about [[Moringa|Moringa oleifera]], a nutritional plant species useful for providing essential vitamins and minerals for people in developing countries in the tropics. To order seeds from ECHO as an active development worker, create an account on ECHOcommunity.org and request seeds through the website. Free trial packets can only be received once per year.

==Technical Notes==
ECHO publishes a series of technical notes that cover a variety of topics related to [[appropriate technology]], [[agroecology]] and [[agroforestry]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="25237">'''Failure mode, effects and criticality analysis (FMECA)''' is an extension of [[failure mode and effects analysis]] (FMEA). 

FMEA is a bottom-up, [[inductive reasoning|inductive]] analytical method which may be performed at either the functional or piece-part level. FMECA extends FMEA by including a ''criticality analysis'', which is used to chart the [[probability]] of failure modes against the severity of their consequences. The result highlights failure modes with relatively high probability and severity of consequences, allowing remedial effort to be directed where it will produce the greatest value. FMECA tends to be preferred over FMEA in [[Outer space|space]] and [[NATO|North Atlantic Treaty Organization]] (NATO) [[military]] applications, while various forms of FMEA predominate in other industries.

==History==

Possibly because MIL&amp;ndash;P&amp;ndash;1629 was replaced by MIL&amp;ndash;STD&amp;ndash;1629&amp;nbsp;(SHIPS) in 1974, development of FMECA is sometimes incorrectly attributed to NASA.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite manual

At the same time as the space program developments, use of FMEA and FMECA was already 
spreading to civil aviation. In 1967 the [[SAE International|Society for Automotive 
Engineers]] released the first civil publication to address FMECA.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite manual

Ford Motor Company began using FMEA in the 1970s after problems experienced with its [[Ford Pinto|Pinto]] 
model, and by the 1980s FMEA was gaining broad use in the automotive industry. In Europe, 
the International Electrotechnical Commission published IEC&amp;nbsp;812 (now IEC&amp;nbsp;60812) in 1985, addressing both FMEA and FMECA for general use.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite manual

In 1980, MIL&amp;ndash;STD&amp;ndash;1629A replaced both MIL&amp;ndash;STD&amp;ndash;1629 and the 1977 aeronautical FMECA standard MIL&amp;ndash;STD&amp;ndash;2070.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite manual|       last =|       first =|       author-link =|       title =Procedures for Performing a Failure Mode, Effects and Criticaility Analysis|       section =|       sectionurl =|       version =A|       publisher =[[United States Department of Defense|U.S. Department of Defense]]|       year =1980|       url =https://assist.daps.dla.mil/quicksearch/basic_profile.cfm?ident_number=37027|       format =pdf|       id =MIL&amp;ndash;HDBK&amp;ndash;1629A|       accessdate =2010-03-14|       quote =|       page =|       pages =|       deadurl =yes|       archiveurl =https://web.archive.org/web/20110722222459/https://assist.daps.dla.mil/quicksearch/basic_profile.cfm?ident_number=37027|       archivedate =2011-07-22|       df =}}&lt;/ref&gt; MIL&amp;ndash;STD&amp;ndash;1629A was canceled without replacement in 1998, but nonetheless remains in wide use for military and space applications today.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite manual|       last =|       first =|       author-link =Air Force Research Laboratory|       title =Electronic Reliability Design Handbook|       section =7.8 Failure Mode and Effects Analysis (FMEA)|       sectionurl =|       version =B|       publisher =[[United States Department of Defense|U.S. Department of Defense]]|       year =1998|       url =https://assist.daps.dla.mil/quicksearch/basic_profile.cfm?ident_number=54022|       format =pdf|       id =MIL&amp;ndash;HDBK&amp;ndash;338B|       accessdate =2010-03-13|       quote =|       page =|       pages =|       deadurl =yes|       archiveurl =https://web.archive.org/web/20110722222601/https://assist.daps.dla.mil/quicksearch/basic_profile.cfm?ident_number=54022|       archivedate =2011-07-22|       df =}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Methodology==
Slight differences are found between the various FMECA standards. By RAC CRTA&amp;ndash;FMECA, the FMECA analysis procedure typically consists of the following logical steps:
* Define the system
* Define ground rules and assumptions in order to help drive the design
* Construct system block diagrams
* Identify failure modes (piece part level or functional)
* Analyze failure effects/causes
* Feed results back into design process
* Classify the failure effects by severity
* Perform criticality calculations
* Rank failure mode criticality
* Determine critical items
* Feed results back into design process
* Identify the means of failure detection, isolation and compensation
* Perform maintainability analysis
* Document the analysis, summarize uncorrectable design areas, identify special controls necessary to reduce failure risk
* Make recommendations
* Follow up on corrective action implementation/effectiveness

FMECA may be performed at the functional or piece part level. Functional FMECA considers the effects of failure at the functional block level, such as a power supply or an amplifier. 
Piece part FMECA considers the effects of individual component failures, such as resistors, 
transistors, microcircuits, or valves. A piece part FMECA requires far more effort, but provides the benefit of better estimates of probabilities of occurrence. However, Functional FMEAs can be performed much earlier, may help to better structure the complete risk assessment and provide other type of insight in mitigation options. The analyses are complementary.

The criticality analysis may be quantitative or qualitative, depending on the availability of supporting part failure data.

===System definition===
In this step, the major system to be analyzed is defined and partitioned into an indentured 
hierarchy such as systems, subsystems or equipment, units or subassemblies, and piece parts. Functional descriptions are created for the systems and allocated to the subsystems, 
covering all operational modes and mission phases.

===Ground rules and assumptions===
Before detailed analysis takes place, ground rules and assumptions are usually defined and agreed to. This might include, for example:
* Standardized mission profile with specific fixed duration mission phases
* Sources for failure rate and failure mode data
* Fault detection coverage that system built-in test will realize
* Whether the analysis will be functional or piece part
* Criteria to be considered (mission abort, safety, maintenance, etc.)
* System for uniquely identifying parts or functions
* Severity category definitions

===Block diagrams===
Next, the systems and subsystems are depicted in functional block diagrams. Reliability 
block diagrams or fault trees are usually constructed at the same time. These diagrams are 
used to trace information flow at different levels of system hierarchy, identify critical 
paths and interfaces, and identify the higher level effects of lower level failures.

===Failure mode identification===
For each piece part or each function covered by the analysis, a complete list of failure 
modes is developed. For functional FMECA, typical failure modes include:
* Untimely operation
* Failure to operate when required
* Loss of output
* Intermittent output
* Erroneous output (given the current condition)
* Invalid output (for any condition)

For piece part FMECA, failure mode data may be obtained from databases such as RAC 
FMD&amp;ndash;91&lt;ref&gt;{{cite manual

|       pages =
}}&lt;/ref&gt; These databases provide not only the failure modes, but also the failure mode 
ratios. For example: 
{| class="wikitable" style="margin: 1em auto 1em auto"
|+ '''Device Failure Modes and Failure Mode Ratios (FMD&amp;ndash;91) '''
! Device Type || Failure Mode || Ratio (α)
|-
| Relay  || Fails to trip || .55
|-
|        || Spurious trip || .26
|-
|        || Short         || .19
|-
| Resistor, Composition || Parameter change || .66
|-
|                        || Open             || .31
|-
|                        || Short            || .03
|}
Each function or piece part is then listed in matrix form with one row for each failure 
mode. Because FMECA usually involves very large data sets, a unique identifier must be assigned to each item (function or piece part), and to each failure mode of each item.

===Failure effects analysis===
Failure effects are determined and entered for each row of the FMECA matrix, considering the 
criteria identified in the ground rules. Effects are separately described for the local, next higher, and end (system) levels. System level effects may include:
* System failure
* Degraded operation
* System status failure
* No immediate effect
The failure effect categories used at various hierarchical levels are tailored by the 
analyst using engineering judgment.

===Severity classification===
Severity classification is assigned for each failure mode of each unique item and entered on the FMECA matrix, based upon system level consequences. A small set of classifications, 
usually having 3 to 10 severity levels, is used. For example, When prepared using MIL&amp;ndash;STD&amp;ndash;1629A, failure or mishap severity classification normally follows MIL&amp;ndash;STD&amp;ndash;882.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite manual|       last =|       first =|       author-link =Air Force Materiel Command Safety Office|       title =Standard Practice for System Safety|       section =|       sectionurl =|       version =D|       publisher =[[United States Department of Defense|U.S. Department of Defense]]|       year =1998|       url =https://assist.daps.dla.mil/quicksearch/basic_profile.cfm?ident_number=36027|       format =pdf|       id =MIL&amp;ndash;HDBK&amp;ndash;882D|       accessdate =2010-03-14|       quote =|       page =|       pages =|       deadurl =yes|       archiveurl =https://web.archive.org/web/20110722222803/https://assist.daps.dla.mil/quicksearch/basic_profile.cfm?ident_number=36027|       archivedate =2011-07-22|       df =}}&lt;/ref&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Failure detection methods===
For each component and failure mode, the ability of the system to detect and report the 
failure in question is analyzed. One of the following will be entered on each row of the FMECA matrix:
* ''Normal'': the system correctly indicates a safe condition to the crew
* ''Abnormal'': the system correctly indicates a malfunction requiring crew action
* ''Incorrect'': the system erroneously indicates a safe condition in the event of malfunction, or alerts the crew to a malfunction that does not exist (false alarm)

===Criticality ranking===
Failure mode criticality assessment may be qualitative or quantitative. For qualitative 
assessment, a mishap probability code or number is assigned and entered on the matrix. For 
example, MIL&amp;ndash;STD&amp;ndash;882 uses five probability levels:
{| class="wikitable" style="margin: 1em auto 1em auto"
|+ '''Failure Probability Levels (MIL&amp;ndash;STD&amp;ndash;882)'''
! Description || Level || Individual Item || Fleet
|-
| Frequent   || A || Likely to occur often in the life of the item || Continuously experienced
|-
| Probable   || B || Will occur several times in the life of an item || Will occur frequently
|-
| Occasional || C || Likely to occur some time in the life of an item || Will occur several times
|- 
| Remote     || D || Unlikely but possible to occur in the life of an item || Unlikely, but can reasonably be expected to occur
|-
| Improbable || E || So unlikely, it can be assumed occurrence may not be experienced || Unlikely to occur, but possible
|}
The failure mode may then be charted on a criticality matrix using severity code as one axis 
and probability level code as the other.
For quantitative assessment, ''modal criticality number'' &lt;math&gt;C_m&lt;/math&gt; is calculated for each failure mode of each item, and ''item criticality number'' &lt;math&gt;C_r&lt;/math&gt; is 
calculated for each item. The criticality numbers are computed using the following values:
* Basic failure rate &lt;math&gt;\lambda_p&lt;/math&gt;
* Failure mode ratio &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt;
* Conditional probability &lt;math&gt;\beta&lt;/math&gt;
* Mission phase duration &lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt;
The criticality numbers are computed as &lt;math&gt;C_m = \lambda_p \alpha \beta t&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;C_r = \sum_{n=1}^N (C_m)_n&lt;/math&gt;.
The basic failure rate &lt;math&gt;\lambda_p&lt;/math&gt; is usually fed into the FMECA from a failure rate prediction based on MIL&amp;ndash;HDBK&amp;ndash;217, PRISM, RIAC&amp;nbsp;217Plus, or a similar 
model.
The failure mode ratio may be taken from a database source such as RAC FMD&amp;ndash;97. For functional level FMECA, engineering judgment may be required to assign failure mode ratio.
The conditional probability number &lt;math&gt;\beta&lt;/math&gt; represents the conditional
probability that the failure effect will result in the identified severity classification,
given that the failure mode occurs. It represents the analyst's best judgment as to the 
likelihood that the loss will occur.
For graphical analysis, a criticality matrix may be charted using either &lt;math&gt;C_m&lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt;C_r&lt;/math&gt; on one axis and severity code on the other.

===Critical item/failure mode list===
Once the criticality assessment is completed for each failure mode of each item, the FMECA matrix may be sorted by severity and qualitative probability level or quantitative 
criticality number. This enables the analysis to identify critical items and critical 
failure modes for which design mitigation is desired.

===Recommendations===
After performing FMECA, recommendations are made to design to reduce the consequences of critical failures. This may include selecting components with higher reliability, reducing 
the stress level at which a critical item operates, or adding redundancy or monitoring to the system.

===Maintainability analysis===
FMECA usually feeds into both Maintainability Analysis and [[Logistics Support Analysis]], which both require data from the FMECA.

===FMECA report===
A FMECA report consists of system description, ground rules and assumptions, conclusions and 
recommendations, corrective actions to be tracked, and the attached FMECA matrix which may 
be in spreadsheet, worksheet, or database form.

==Risk priority calculation==
RAC CRTA&amp;ndash;FMECA and MIL&amp;ndash;HDBK&amp;ndash;338 both identify Risk Priority Number (RPN) 
calculation as an alternate method to criticality analysis. The RPN is a result 
of a multiplication of detectability (D) x severity (S) x 
occurrence (O). With each on a scale from 1 to 10, the highest RPN is 
10x10x10 = 1000. This means that this 
failure is not detectable by inspection, very severe and the occurrence is almost sure. If 
the occurrence is very sparse, this would be 1 and the RPN would 
decrease to 100. So, criticality analysis enables to focus on the highest risks.

==Advantages and disadvantages==
Strengths of FMECA include its comprehensiveness, the systematic establishment of relationships between failure causes and effects, and its ability to point out individual failure modes for corrective action in design. Weaknesses include the extensive labor required, the large number of trivial cases considered, and inability to deal with multiple-failure scenarios or unplanned cross-system effects such as [[Sneak circuit analysis|sneak circuits]].

According to an FAA research report for commercial space transportation, 
:''Failure Modes, effects, and Criticality Analysis is an excellent hazard analysis and risk assessment tool, but it suffers from other limitations. This alternative does not consider combined failures or typically include software and human interaction considerations. It also usually provides an optimistic estimate of reliability. Therefore, FMECA should be used in conjunction with other analytical tools when developing reliability estimates.''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite manual

'''First flush''' is the initial [[surface runoff]] of a rainstorm. During this phase, [[water pollution]] entering [[storm drain]]s in areas with high proportions of [[impervious surface]]s is typically more [[concentration|concentrated]] compared to the remainder of the storm. Consequently, these high concentrations of [[urban runoff]] result in high levels of pollutants discharged from storm sewers to [[surface water]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Metcalf | first = Leonard | author-link = | last2 = Eddy | first2 = Harrison P. | author2-link = | title = American Sewerage Practice: Disposal of Sewage | place = New York | publisher = McGraw-Hill | year = 1916 | volume = III | edition = | url =https://books.google.com/books?id=iJ3VAAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA154#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |page= 154 | isbn = }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Pitt1"&gt;Alex Maestre and Robert Pitt; Center for Watershed Protection (2005).[http://unix.eng.ua.edu/~rpitt/Publications/Stormwater%20Characteristics/NSQD%20EPA.pdf "The National Stormwater Quality Database, Version 1.1: A Compilation and Analysis of NPDES Stormwater Monitoring Information."] Report prepared for U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), Washington, DC.

==First flush effect==
The term "first flush effect" refers to rapid changes in [[water quality]] (pollutant concentration or load) that occur after early season rains. [[Soil]] and vegetation particles wash into streams; [[sediment]]s and other accumulated [[organic compound|organic]] particles on the river bed are re-suspended, and dissolved substances from soil and shallow groundwater can be flushed into streams.

The term is often also used to address the first flood after a dry period, which is supposed to contain higher concentrations than a subsequent one. This is referred to as "first flush flood." There are various definitions of the first flush phenomenon.&lt;ref&gt;Australian Government, Department of the Environment and Heritage. Canberra.

==First foul flush==
Storm water runoff in a [[combined sewer]] produces a '''first foul flush''' with a suspension of accumulated sanitary solids from the sewer in addition to pollutants from surface runoff. [[Infiltration/inflow|Inflow]] may produce a foul flush effect in [[sanitary sewer]]s if flows peak during wet weather. As flow rates increase above average, a relatively small percentage of the total flow contains a disproportionately large percentage of the total pollutant mass associated with overall flow volume through the peak flow event. Sewer solids deposition during low flow periods and subsequent resuspension during peak flow events is the major pollutant source for the first-flush combined-sewer overflow (CSO) phenomenon.&lt;ref name=ssc&gt;{{cite report |url=https://nepis.epa.gov/Exe/ZyPURL.cgi?Dockey=2000E6DC.txt |title=Sewer-Sediment Control: Overview of an EPA Wet-Weather Flow Research Program |last1=Fan |first1=Chi-Yuan |last2=Field |first2=Richard |last3=Lai |first3=Fu-hsiung |publisher=EPA |date=2003 |id=EPA 600/J-03/188}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sanitary sewage solids can either go through the system or settle out in [[laminar flow]] portions of the sewer to be available for washout during peak flows.  The [[wetted perimeter]] of sewers may also be colonized by [[biofilm]] nourished by soluble sanitary wastes. Hydraulic design is the underlying reason for solids deposition in sewers. Combined sewers sized for peak runoff events expected once a decade can carry up to 1,000 times the average sanitary flow. Less dramatically oversized sewers are common in new developments and near the upstream end of collection systems. [[Suspended solids]] may accumulate when low-flow fluid velocities generate insufficient [[turbulence]]. Solids deposition is greatest where velocities are low during dry weather. In large combined sewers it may be impossible to attain sanitary sewage velocities generating sufficient turbulence to keep solids suspended during dry weather.&lt;ref name=ssc/&gt;

Biofilm and previously deposited solids may be scoured and re-entrained during peak flow turbulence.&lt;ref name=mss&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Fraser |first1=A.G. |last2=Sakrabani |first2=R. |last3=Ashley |first3=R.M. |last4=Johnstone |first4=F.M. |year=2002 |title=Managing sewer solids for the reduction of foul flush effects--Forfar WTP |journal=Water Science &amp; Technology |volume=45 |issue=3 |pages=265–272 |publisher=US National Library of Medicine National Institutes of Health }}&lt;/ref&gt; The high pollution load in wastewater at the beginning of a runoff event occurs when increased flow rate erodes accumulated sewer sediment.&lt;ref name=wrro&gt;{{cite web |url=http://eprints.whiterose.ac.uk/8728/5/Sakrabani_Biodegradability1.pdf |title=Biodegradabilty of Organic Matter associated with Sewer Sediments during First Flush |last1=Sakrabani |first1=Ruben |last2=Vollertsen |first2=Jes |last3=Ashley |first3=Richard M. |last4=Hvitved-Jacobsen |first4=Thorkild |website=White Rose Research Online |publisher=[[University of Sheffield]] |accessdate=12 March 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Erosion of sediments in sewers can release pollutants in concentrations exceeding levels found in contributing sources. The initial highly polluting foul flush is released at the start of wet weather flow during speedy erosion of a weak layer of highly concentrated surficial sediment bed-load.&lt;ref name=wst&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Ashley |first1=R.M. |last2=Wotherspoon |first2=D.J.J. |last3=Coghlan |first3=B.P. |last4=McGregor |first4=I. |year=1992 |title=The Erosion and Movement of Sediments and Associated Pollutants in Combined Sewers |journal=Water Science &amp; Technology |volume=73 |issue=5 |pages=101–114 |publisher=IWA Publishing }}&lt;/ref&gt; When conditions favor dry-weather solids deposition, the first foul flush may contain as much as 30 percent of the annual total suspended solids discharged to a combined sewer system.  Combined sewer suspended solids concentrations of several thousand milligrams per liter (mg/L) may be observed during the first foul flush.&lt;ref name=ssc/&gt;

Pollutant concentration levels are influenced by the age and condition of the collection system and the amount of infiltration/inflow in comparison to the sanitary flow.  Pollutant concentration peaks depend on size and slope of the piping system, time interval between storms, and solids accumulation in the collection system. Steeper sewer gradients and pipe bottom shapes that maintain high velocity flow during low-flow conditions will reduce sediment accumulation in sewers; and periodic sewer flushing of individual lines during dry weather may move accumulated solids to the [[wastewater treatment plant]] before stormwater runoff causes simultaneous peak flow in the entire collection system.&lt;ref name="EPA-CSO"&gt;{{cite report |url=https://nepis.epa.gov/Exe/ZyPURL.cgi?Dockey=30004MAO.txt |title=Combined Sewer Overflow Control Manual |publisher=EPA |date=September 1993 |pages=5, 9–10&amp;19 |id=EPA/625/R-93/003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Related terms==
Because the reference of the first flush is not always clear, the terms "concentration-based first flush" (CBFF) and "mass-based first flush" (MBFF) have been introduced.&lt;ref name="Sansalone"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1061/(ASCE)0733-9372(2004)130:11(1301) |last1=Sansalone |first1=John |last2=Christina |first2=Chad M. |date=November 2004 |title=First flush concepts for dissolved solids in small impervious watersheds |journal=Journal of Environmental Engineering |volume= 130 |issue=11 |pages=1301–1314 |issn= 0733-9372}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Apart from this definition, there are a number of rating parameters in literature to determine the occurrence of a first flush.&lt;ref name="Sansalone" /&gt;

==Rainwater harvesting==
In the context of [[rainwater harvesting]], a first flush diverter is a simple device that is designed to protect a storage [[cistern]] from contamination by first flush runoff. This leads to a higher quality of water captured, and less silting of the cistern over time in dusty areas. The diverted first flush water is used for irrigation or other purposes in a fashion similar to [[greywater]].&lt;ref&gt;University of Hawai`i Agricultural Extension. Manoa, HI (2008). [http://www.ctahr.hawaii.edu/hawaiirain/downloads/5_flush.pdf "Rainwater Catchment Solutions: First-Flush Diverters."] Brochure.&lt;/ref&gt; Although many commercial versions are available, these devices are frequently constructed of spare pipe when the cistern is initially installed or thereafter. See ''Texas Manual on Rainwater Harvesting'' for calculations on sizing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite report |publisher=Texas Water Development Board |location=Austin, TX |date=2005 |url=https://www.twdb.texas.gov/publications/brochures/conservation/doc/RainwaterHarvestingManual_3rdedition.pdf |title=Texas Manual on Rainwater Harvesting |edition=3rd |pages=8–9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''footprint''' or '''land pattern''' is the arrangement of [[Contact pad|pads]] (in [[surface-mount technology]]) or through-holes (in [[through-hole technology]]) used to physically attach and electrically connect a component to a [[printed circuit board]].&lt;ref name="ipc7351"&gt;{{cite book | title=IPC-7351 - Generic Requirements for Surface Mount Design and Land Pattern Standard | publisher=IPC | year=2005 | pages=4}}&lt;/ref&gt; The land pattern on a circuit board matches the arrangement of [[Lead (electronics)|leads]] on a component.

Component manufacturers often produce multiple [[Pin compatibility|pin-compatible]] product variants to allow [[Systems integrator|systems integrators]] to change the exact component in use without changing the footprint on the circuit board. This can provide large cost savings for integrators, especially with dense [[Ball Grid Array|BGA]] components where the footprint pads may be connected to multiple [[Printed circuit board#Lamination|layers]] of the circuit board.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="70403">A correlation between '''fraternal birth order and male sexual orientation''' has been suggested by research. [[Ray Blanchard]] identified the association and referred to it as the '''fraternal birth order effect'''.  In several studies, the observation is that the more older [[brother]]s a man has from the same mother, the greater the probability is that he will have a [[homosexuality|homosexual]] [[sexual orientation|orientation]].&lt;ref name=Blanchard1997&gt;{{cite journal |author=Blanchard R |title=Birth order and sibling sex ratio in homosexual versus heterosexual males and females |journal=Annu Rev Sex Res |volume=8 |issue= |pages=27–67 |year=1997 |pmid=10051890 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It has sometimes been called the ''older brother effect''. It has been estimated that 15% of the homosexual demographic is associated with fraternal birth order.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Valenzuela C | year = 2009 | title = Sexual Orientation, Handedness, Sex Ratio, and Fetomaternal Tolerance-Rejection | url = | journal = Biological Research | volume = 43 | issue = 3| pages = 347–356 | doi=10.4067/s0716-97602010000300012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview==
The fraternal birth order effect has been described by one of its proponents as "the most consistent biodemographic correlate of sexual orientation in men".&lt;ref name = Bogaert2006&gt;{{cite journal |author=Bogaert AF |title=Biological versus nonbiological older brothers and men's sexual orientation |journal=Proc.

Research over the years has established several facts. First, homosexual men do tend to have a higher birth order than heterosexual men, and this higher birth order is attributed to homosexual men having greater number of older brothers.&lt;ref name="2017meta-analysis"&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Blanchard R|title=Fraternal Birth Order, Family Size, and Male Homosexuality: Meta-Analysis of Studies Spanning 25 Years.|journal=Arch.

Secondly, the fraternal birth order effect operates through a biological mechanism during prenatal life, not during childhood or adolescence.&lt;ref name=BogaertSkorskaReview11/&gt; Direct evidence for this is the fact that the fraternal birth order effect has been found even in males not raised with their biological brothers – it has been determined that biological brothers increase the odds of homosexuality in later-born males even if they were reared in different households, whereas non-biological siblings, such as step-brothers or adopted brothers, have no effect on male sexual orientation.&lt;ref name = Bogaert2006/&gt;
Indirect evidence also indicates that the fraternal birth order effect is prenatal and biological in nature rather than postnatal and psychosocial: The fraternal birth order effect has been confirmed to interact with [[handedness]],&lt;ref name=Blanchardhand2007/&gt;&lt;ref name=BogaertSkorskaReview11 /&gt; as the incidence of homosexuality correlated with an increase in older brothers is seen only in right-handed males.&lt;ref name="Blanchard &amp; Lippa 2007"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Blanchard |first1=R |last2=Lippa |first2=RA |title=Birth order, sibling sex ratio, handedness, and sexual orientation of male and female participants in a BBC internet research project |journal=Arch Sex Behav |volume=36 |issue=2 |pages=163–76 |date=April 2007 |pmid=17345165|doi=10.1007/s10508-006-9159-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=BlanCanBreeEll06&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Blanchard R, Cantor JM, Bogaert AF, Breedlove SM, Ellis L |title=Interaction of fraternal birth order and handedness in the development of male homosexuality |journal=Horm Behav |volume=49 |issue=3 |pages=405–14 |date=March 2006 |pmid=16246335 |doi=10.1016/j.yhbeh.2005.09.002 |url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0018-506X(05)00213-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Blanchard R |title=Sex ratio of older siblings in heterosexual and homosexual, right-handed and non-right-handed men |journal=Archives of Sexual Behavior |volume= 37|issue= 6|pages= 977–81|year=2007 |doi=10.1007/s10508-006-9119-2 |pmid=17186124}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Blanchardhand2007&gt;{{cite journal |last=Blanchard |first=Ray |title=Review and theory of handedness, birth order, and homosexuality in men |journal=Laterality |volume=13 |issue=1 |pages=51–70 |date=January 2008 |pmid=18050001 |doi=10.1080/13576500701710432 |url=http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/13576500701710432}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since handedness develops prenatally,&lt;ref name=Hepperetal1991&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Hepper PG|author2=Shahidullah S|author3=White R|title=Handedness in the human fetus|journal=Neuropsychologia|date=1991|volume=29|issue=11|pages=1107–11|doi=10.1016/0028-3932(91)90080-R|pmid=1775228}}&lt;/ref&gt; this finding indicates that prenatal mechanisms underlie the fraternal birth order effect.&lt;ref name=BogaertSkorskaReview11/&gt; It has also been found that homosexual males with older brothers have significantly lower birth weights compared to heterosexual males with older brothers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Blanchard R|author2=Ellis L|title=Birth weight, sexual orientation and the sex of preceding siblings|journal=J.

==Empirical findings==
===Biodemographics===
The fraternal birth order effect is a phenomenon that can be described in one of two ways:&lt;ref name=Blanchardfamilysize/&gt; Older brothers increase the odds of homosexuality in later-born males or, alternatively, homosexual men tend to have more older brothers than do heterosexual men.&lt;ref name="2017meta-analysis"/&gt;&lt;ref name=BlanchardQuan04&gt;{{cite journal |author=Blanchard R |title=Quantitative and theoretical analyses of the relation between older brothers and homosexuality in men |journal=J. Theor. Biol. |volume=230 |issue=2 |pages=173–87 |date=September 2004 |pmid=15302549 |doi=10.1016/j.jtbi.2004.04.021 |url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0022519304001924}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=BogaertSkorskaReview11 /&gt; It has been found that the proportion of older brothers (i.e., {{sfrac|Older Brothers|All Siblings}}) is 31% greater in the sibships of homosexual males than in the sibships of heterosexual males.&lt;ref name="2017meta-analysis"/&gt; Alternatively, the ratio of older brothers to other siblings (i.e., {{sfrac|Older Brothers|Other Siblings}}) is 47% greater for homosexual males than it is for heterosexual males.&lt;ref name="2017meta-analysis"/&gt;

After statistically controlling for number of older brothers, homosexual and heterosexual males do not differ in their mean number of older sisters, younger sisters or younger brothers.&lt;ref name=Baileyetal2016/&gt;&lt;ref name="2017meta-analysis"/&gt; Older sisters, younger sisters, and younger brothers have no effect on the odds of homosexuality in later born males – they neither enhance nor counteract the fraternal birth order effect.&lt;ref name=BlanBog96/&gt;&lt;ref name="Blanchard 2001"/&gt;&lt;ref name=BogaertSkorskaReview11/&gt;&lt;ref name="2017meta-analysis"/&gt; Blanchard and Bogaert (1996) investigated whether homosexual men have a higher mean birth order than heterosexual men primarily because they have more older brothers or because they have more older siblings of both sexes (i.e., both older brothers and older sisters).&lt;ref name=BlanBog96/&gt; They confirmed that homosexuality was positively correlated with a man's number of older brothers, not older sisters, younger sisters, or younger brothers.&lt;ref name=BlanBog96/&gt; Multiple studies have since confirmed this finding.&lt;ref name="Blanchard 2001"/&gt;

In a few studies, homosexual subjects have occasionally displayed both a larger number of older brothers and a larger number of older sisters in comparison to heterosexual men. This is because a person's number of older brothers and number of older sisters tend to be positively correlated. So, if Proband A has more older brothers than Proband B, chances are that Proband A also has more older sisters than Proband B.&lt;ref name=Blanchard1997/&gt;&lt;ref name="BlanchardVanderLaan2015"/&gt; These findings of excess of older sisters are hence occasional by-products of homosexual men having an excess of older brothers, are not found as consistently as the excess of older brothers, and thus need not detract from the significance of the fraternal birth order effect.&lt;ref name="BlanchardVanderLaan2015"/&gt;&lt;ref name="VanderLaanBrazil2017"/&gt; When samples are drawn from populations with relatively high fertility rates, the positive correlation between number of older brothers and older sisters may give the false impression that both the number of older brothers and the number of older sisters are associated with male sexual orientation. Indeed, two samples from the high fertility Samoan population displayed simultaneous fraternal and 'sororal' birth order effects. However, direct comparison of the magnitudes of these two effects showed that the fraternal birth order effect took precedence in the studies.&lt;ref name=VanderLaanVasey2011/&gt;&lt;ref name="BlanchardVanderLaan2015"/&gt; Various studies and [[meta-analysis|meta-analyses]] have confirmed that only the older brother effect is consistently associated with homosexuality:&lt;ref name=BlanchardQuan04/&gt;&lt;ref name="BlanchardVanderLaan2015"/&gt;

* A 1998 meta-analysis by Jones and Blanchard investigated whether older sisters have no effect on sexual orientation in later-born males, or simply a weaker effect than older brothers. To this end, they developed competing mathematical models of the two possibilities: they derived two theoretical equations; the first equation applies if sisters have no direct relation to a proband's sexual orientation but brothers do; the second applies if sisters have the same relation to a proband's sexual orientation as do brothers (including no relation). They then compared the fit of these models to the empirical data available at that time and found that the first equation held for homosexual men and the second for heterosexual men. They also concluded that any tendency for homosexual males to be born later among their sisters is, in effect, a statistical artifact of their tendency to be born later among their brothers.&lt;ref name="JonesBlanchard1998Meta"&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Jones MB|author2=Blanchard R|title=Birth order and male homosexuality: extension of Slater's index|journal=Hum. Biol.|date=Aug 1998|volume=70|issue=4|pages=775–87|pmid=9686486}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=BlanchardQuan04/&gt;&lt;ref name="2017meta-analysis"/&gt;
* A 2004 meta-analysis involved 10,143 male subjects of which 3181 were homosexual and 6962 were heterosexual. Its results reinforced the conclusion that homosexual men tend to have more older brothers than do heterosexual men, and the conclusion that differences in all other sibship parameters (older sisters, younger sisters, or younger brothers) are secondary consequences of the difference in older brothers.&lt;ref name=BlanchardQuan04/&gt;&lt;ref name="2017meta-analysis"/&gt; The same conclusions have been reached with analyses of individual rather than aggregate data, and by independent investigators.&lt;ref name=BlanchardQuan04/&gt;
* A 2015 meta-analysis determined that only the older brother effect/fraternal birth order effect was reliably associated with male sexual orientation across previously published studies.&lt;ref name="BlanchardVanderLaan2015"/&gt;&lt;ref name="VanderLaanBrazil2017"&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Vanderlaan DP|author2=Blanchard R|author3=Zucker KJ|author4=Massuda R|author5=Fontanari AMV|author6=Borba AO|author7=Costa AB|author8=Schneider MA|author9=Mueller A|author10=Soll BMB|author11=Schwarz K|author12=Da Silva DC|author13=Lobato MIR|title=Birth order and androphilic male-to-female transsexualism in Brazil|journal=J Biosoc Sci.|date=Jul 2017|volume=49|issue=4|pages=527–535|doi=10.1017/S0021932016000584|pmid=27817755}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The fraternal birth order effect is independent of potential [[Confounding factor|confounds]] such as age, year of birth, and socioeconomic status.&lt;ref name=BogaertSkorskaReview11/&gt; It has also been found that the fraternal birth order effect can be demonstrated whether the homosexual and heterosexual groups being compared on older brothers both have large or small family sizes, so long as both groups have the same family size (or can be adjusted to simulate that condition).&lt;ref name="2017meta-analysis"/&gt; Additionally, to detect the fraternal birth order effect, it is necessary that family size of homosexual and heterosexual groups are not strongly affected by the various parental strategies (so-called 'stopping rules') of ceasing reproduction after one child, after one male child, or after a child of each sex, because in these particular situations, neither homosexual nor heterosexual males have enough older brothers to make comparisons meaningful.&lt;ref name="2017meta-analysis"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Blanchard &amp; Lippa 2007"/&gt;&lt;ref name=XuZheng2014&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Xu Y|author2=Zheng Y|title=Birth order and sibling sex ratio in relation to sexual orientation in China|journal=Soc Behav Pers.|date=Jul 2014|volume=42|issue=6|pages=995–1002|doi=10.2224/sbp.2014.42.6.995}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="XuZheng2017"&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Xu Y|author2=Zheng Y|title=Fraternal Birth Order, Handedness, and Sexual Orientation in a Chinese Population|journal=J.

The relation between number of older brothers and male homosexuality is not an artifact of higher maternal or paternal age at the time of the proband's birth.&lt;ref name="Blanchard 2001"/&gt;&lt;ref name=BlanchardQuan04/&gt; This implies that the birth order phenomenon cannot be explained by increased mutation rates in the ova or sperm cells of aging mothers or fathers respectively.&lt;ref name=BlanBog96/&gt;

The relation between number of older brothers and male homosexuality is also not an artifact of birth interval. Blanchard and Bogaert (1997) conducted a study to investigate whether homosexual men are, on average, born a shorter time after their next-older siblings than are heterosexual men. They found that mean birth intervals preceding heterosexual and homosexual males were virtually identical.&lt;ref name="BlanchardBogaert1997c"&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Blanchard R|author2=Bogaert AF|title=The relation of closed birth intervals to the sex of the preceding child and the sexual orientation of the succeeding child|journal=J Biosoc Sci.|date=Jan 1997|volume=29|issue=1|pages=111–8|pmid=9881124|doi=10.1017/s0021932097001119}}&lt;/ref&gt;

No type of sibling (i.e., older brothers, older sisters, younger brothers or younger sisters) is reliably related to women's sexual orientation.&lt;ref name=BogaertSkorskaReview11/&gt;

===Quantitative findings===
Research on the fraternal birth order effect has shown that for every older brother a male child has, there is a 33% increase in the naturally occurring odds that the male child being homosexual.&lt;ref name=BlanBog96/&gt;&lt;ref name=Cantoretal2002/&gt;&lt;ref name=curr/&gt; The naturally occurring odds of a male child (without any older brothers) being homosexual are estimated to be 2%.&lt;ref name=Cantoretal2002/&gt;&lt;ref name=curr/&gt;{{refn|name=closeestimate|group=note|This proved to be a close estimation by Cantor et al. (2002) as a subsequent study, Blanchard and Bogaert (2004), found that the observed prevalence of homosexuality among males with no older brothers was 2.18%.%.&lt;ref name=Blanchardowe/&gt;&lt;ref name=BlanchardQuan04/&gt;}} Thus, if a male with no older brothers has a 2% chance of being homosexual and the fraternal birth order effect increases those chances by 33% for each older brother, then a male with one older brother has a 2.6% chance of being homosexual; a male with two older brothers has a 3.5% chance, and males with three and four older brothers have a 4.6%, and 6.0% chance, respectively.&lt;ref name=Baileyetal2016/&gt;

Estimates of the proportion of homosexual men who owe their sexual orientation to the fraternal birth order effect have ranged from 15.1%&lt;ref name=Cantoretal2002/&gt; to 28.6%.&lt;ref name=Blanchardowe/&gt; The 15.1% estimation, if stated in round numbers, means that roughly 1  in 7  gay men owe their sexual orientation to the fraternal birth order effect.&lt;ref name="Blanchard 2001"/&gt;&lt;ref name=Cantoretal2002/&gt; Cantor et al. (2002) found that 0% of homosexual men with no older brothers, 24% of homosexual men with one older brother, 43% of homosexual men with two older brothers, and so on, can attribute their homosexual orientation to the fraternal birth order effect.&lt;ref name=BlanchardQuan04/&gt; They also showed that the effect of fraternal birth order would exceed all other causes of homosexuality combined in groups of gay men with 3 or more older brothers and would precisely equal all other causes combined in a theoretical group with 2.5 older brothers.&lt;ref name=Cantoretal2002/&gt; Homosexual men who did not acquire their sexual orientation via the fraternal birth order effect (for example, homosexual men with no older brothers) owe their homosexuality to other causes such as certain [[Polymorphism (biology)#Genetics|polymorphic]] genes (colloquially called [[Xq28|"gay genes"]]) or prenatal hormone levels during fetal development.&lt;ref name="Blanchard 2001"/&gt;&lt;ref name=BlanchardQuan04/&gt;&lt;ref name="Janninietal2010"&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Jannini EA|author2=Blanchard R|author3=Camperio-Ciani A|author4=Bancroft J|title=Male homosexuality: nature or culture?|journal=J.

===Timing of the fraternal birth order mechanism===
Both direct and indirect evidence have demonstrated that the mechanism by which the fraternal birth order effect operates is prenatal in timing and biological in nature, rather than postnatal in timing or psychosocial in nature. Indirect evidence was found first when it was discovered that the fraternal birth order effect interacts with birth weight. Then, Bogaert (2006) produced direct evidence that the fraternal birth order mechanism is prenatal. Subsequent research related to handedness has further reinforced these findings.&lt;ref name=BogaertSkorskaReview11/&gt; Evidence that the fraternal birth order effect reflects events during prenatal life is generally consistent with a lack of evidence that it reflects events during postnatal life.&lt;ref name=BlanchardQuan04/&gt;

====Birth weight====
[[File:Baby weight Necker 2014.jpg|thumb|240px|A newborn being weighed after birth. Birth weight is the [[body weight]] of a baby at [[childbirth|birth]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://oasis.state.ga.us/oasis/help/mch.html Definitions] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120402214755/http://oasis.state.ga.us/oasis/help/mch.html |date=April 2, 2012 }} from Georgia Department of Public Health. Date: 12/04/2008. Original citation: "Birthweight: Infant's weight recorded at the time of birth"&lt;/ref&gt;]]
The finding that the fraternal birth order mechanism operates during a male's prenatal development in the mother's womb arose unexpectedly, in a study of sexual orientation, birth order, and birth weight. Blanchard and Ellis (2001) studied 3229 adult, homosexual and heterosexual, men and women (the probands) whose mothers knew the sex of every child (or fetus) that they were pregnant with prior to the proband. Information on birth weight, maternal gravidity, and other demographic variables was reported on questionnaires completed by the probands' mothers.&lt;ref name="Blanchard 2001"/&gt; The study yielded three main observations:
# The heterosexual males with older brothers weighed less at birth than the heterosexual males with older sisters;
# The homosexual males with older brothers weighed less than the heterosexual males with older brothers, and: 
# The homosexual and heterosexual males with no older siblings, or older sisters only, did not differ in birth weight.
Each of these three findings has since been replicated in other studies&lt;ref name=BlanchardQuan04/&gt;&lt;ref name=Blanchardetal2002/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Côté K|author2=Blanchard R|author3=Lalumière ML|title=The influence of birth order on birth weight: does the sex of preceding siblings matter?|journal=J Biosoc Sci.|date=Jul 2003|volume=35|issue=3|pages=455–62|pmid=12887223}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=VanderLaanBW/&gt; (and the general finding that boys with older brothers have smaller birth weights than boys with older sisters is in line with earlier studies).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Magnus P|author2=Berg K|author3=Bjerkedal T|title=The association of parity and birth weight: testing the sensitization hypothesis|journal=Early Hum Dev.|date=Oct 1985|volume=12|issue=1|pages=49–54|doi=10.1016/0378-3782(85)90136-7|pmid=4064997}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Trotnow S|author2=Bregulla K|author3=Flügel K|title=Studies on the birth-weight and the size of the new-born child with reference to the parity of the mother (author's transl)|journal=Geburtshilfe Frauenheilkd.|date=Sep 1976|volume=36|issue=9|pages=744–50|pmid=976720|language=German}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=BlanchardQuan04/&gt; These findings suggest that prior male pregnancies influence the development of subsequent male fetuses; that this influence is felt to varying degrees by individual fetuses; and that those fetuses who are most strongly affected by this process, as indicated by their comparatively lower birth weights, are also those most likely to be homosexual. The interaction of fraternal birth order with birth weight (an obviously prenatally determined trait) suggests that the mechanism of the fraternal birth order effect operates before the individual's birth (i.e., [[in utero]]).&lt;ref name="Blanchard 2001"/&gt;&lt;ref name=BlanchardQuan04/&gt; It also shows that, even at the time of birth, there is a physical marker of sexual orientation (i.e., birth weight) that is related to the number of older brothers.&lt;ref name=VanderLaanBOSS/&gt;&lt;ref name="VanderLaanBrazil2017"/&gt;

====Handedness====
[[File:Coast watch (1979) (20659957125).jpg|thumb|253px|Two boys use their right hands to write. Handedness is the tendency to be more skilled at performing tasks with one hand than the other. The fraternal birth order effect increases the likelihood of homosexuality only in right-handed males.]]
Blanchard et al. (2006) produced indirect evidence that the fraternal birth order effect is biological rather than psychosocial in nature: They found, in a sample of 3146 men, that the fraternal birth order effect was contingent on handedness: The effect of older brothers on the likelihood of homosexuality only occurred in right-handed males; the effect of older brothers did not alter the likelihood of being gay in left-handed and ambidextrous men.&lt;ref name=BlanCanBreeEll06/&gt;&lt;ref name=BogaertSkorskaReview11/&gt; Later, another study found the fraternal birth order effect may be limited to only moderately right handed men, as extreme right-handers also did not display a fraternal birth order effect.&lt;ref name=Bogaertetal2007/&gt;&lt;ref name=BogaertSkorskaReview11/&gt; The finding that fraternal birth order interacts with handedness has been confirmed by subsequent research.&lt;ref name=Blanchardhand2007/&gt;&lt;ref name="Blanchard &amp; Lippa 2007"/&gt;&lt;ref name=BogaertSkorskaReview11/&gt; As handedness is developed during prenatal life,&lt;ref name=Hepperetal1991/&gt;&lt;ref name=BogaertSkorskaReview11/&gt; this suggests that a prenatal mechanism causes increased homosexuality in right-handed male fetuses with older brothers.&lt;ref name=BogaertSkorskaReview11/&gt;

===Mechanism===
In 2017, researchers discovered a biological mechanism of gay people who tend to have older brothers. They think [[Neuroligin 4 Y-linked]] protein is responsible for a later son being gay. They found that women had significantly higher anti-NLGN4Y levels than men. The result also indicates that number of pregnancies, mothers of gay sons, particularly those with older brothers, had significantly higher anti-NLGN4Y levels than did the control samples of women, including mothers of heterosexual sons.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Bogaert |first1=Anthony F. |last2=Skorska |first2=Malvina N. |last3=Wang |first3=Chao |last4=Gabrie |first4=José |last5=MacNeil |first5=Adam J. |last6=Hoffarth |first6=Mark R. |last7=VanderLaan |first7=Doug P. |last8=Zucker |first8=Kenneth J. |last9=Blanchard |first9=Ray |title=Male homosexuality and maternal immune responsivity to the Y-linked protein NLGN4Y |journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences |date=9 January 2018 |volume=115 |issue=2 |pages=302–306 |doi=10.1073/pnas.1705895114 |url=http://www.pnas.org/content/115/2/302 |language=en |issn=0027-8424}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Biological vs. non-biological older brothers====
Bogaert (2006) provided a direct test pitting prenatal against postnatal (e.g., social/rearing) mechanisms and sought to determine which of the two account for the fraternal birth order effect. He examined the association between male sexual orientation and biological siblings (i.e., born from the same mother) and non-biological siblings (i.e., adoptive siblings, step-siblings or paternal half-siblings). Whether and how long participants were reared with these siblings was also examined.&lt;ref name=Bogaert2006/&gt;&lt;ref name=VanderLaanBOSS/&gt;

If rearing or social factors associated with older brothers underlie the fraternal birth order effect, then all older brothers (both biological and non-biological) reared with the participant should predict sexual orientation because all of these older brothers share the social/rearing environment with their younger brothers. If a prenatal factor underlies the fraternal birth order effect, then only biological older brothers should predict sexual orientation because only biological older brothers share prenatal characteristics (e.g., gestation by the same biological mother) with their younger brothers. The study found that only biological older brothers predicted sexual orientation. Even when the number of non-biological older brothers significantly exceeded the number of biological older brothers, and hence the opportunity for an effect via being reared with (non-biological) older brothers was high, only the number of biological older brothers and not non-biological older brothers predicted sexual orientation in men.&lt;ref name=Bogaert2006/&gt;

Further, if rearing or social factors underlie the fraternal birth order effect, then the amount of time reared with older brothers, either biological or non-biological, should predict sexual orientation because rearing time determines the relative opportunity that older brothers have to affect their younger sibling's (postnatal) sociosexual development. If a prenatal factor underlies the fraternal birth order effect, then a postnatal factor such as rearing time with older siblings (be they biological or non-biological) should have no impact on the sexual orientation of younger male siblings. The study found that the amount of time reared with older brothers, either biological or non-biological, neither predicted sexual orientation nor affected the relationship between older brothers and sexual orientation, thereby pointing to a prenatal origin of the fraternal birth order effect.&lt;ref name=Bogaert2006/&gt;

Finally, if rearing or social factors underlie the fraternal birth order effect, then the number of biological older brothers with whom the participants were not reared should not predict sexual orientation because they should have no impact on the (postnatal) sociosexual environment of their younger brothers. If a prenatal factor underlies the fraternal birth order effect, then biological older brothers with whom the participants were not reared should still predict sexual orientation because all biological older brothers, even those not reared with the participants, share prenatal characteristics (e.g., gestation by the same mother) with their younger brothers. The study found that the number of biological brothers does predict men's sexual orientation even if the participants were not reared with the biological older brothers.&lt;ref name=Bogaert2006/&gt;

In summation, it was found that biological older brothers significantly predicted male sexual orientation regardless of whether or how long participants were reared with these brothers whereas the remaining sibling categories, including non-biological older brothers, did not. These results thus support a prenatal origin to sexual orientation development in men&lt;ref name=Bogaert2006/&gt;&lt;ref name=BogaertSkorskaReview11/&gt;&lt;ref name=VanderLaanBOSS/&gt; and indicate that the fraternal birth order effect is probably the result of the mother's body's “memory” for both male births as well as male [[gestation]]s (i.e., every instance of being pregnant with a male fetus).&lt;ref name=Bogaert2006/&gt; So even if a male fetus was not carried to term, he still increases the likelihood of homosexuality in any subsequent male fetuses gestated by the same mother.

===Ubiquity===
The existence of the fraternal birth order effect on male sexual orientation has been confirmed many times.&lt;ref name=BogaertSkorskaReview11/&gt; One approach for establishing the ubiquity of this effect has been to search for it in a variety of sample types.&lt;ref name="VanderLaanBrazil2017"/&gt; The repeated finding of the fraternal birth order effect in diverse samples shows that the effect is nearly ubiquitous – with the exception of populations where people do not have older brothers.&lt;ref name=Zuckeretal2007/&gt;&lt;ref name="XuZheng2017"/&gt;&lt;ref name="VanderLaanBrazil2017"/&gt;

The fraternal birth order effect has been found in homosexual males from different races,&lt;ref name=Bogaert98/&gt; including White, Black, Hispanic, East Indian, Asian, Middle Eastern and Polynesian.&lt;ref name=VanderLaanVasey2011/&gt; The effect has also been found in homosexual males from different historical eras,&lt;ref name=BlanBog96/&gt;&lt;ref name=Bogaertetal2007/&gt; ranging from participants examined in recent years to participants examined decades ago.&lt;ref name=BogaertSkorskaReview11/&gt;&lt;ref name=VanderLaanVasey2011/&gt;&lt;ref name=BlanchardQuan04/&gt;

The effect has also been demonstrated in homosexual males from different cultures: Despite how variable cultures can be, cross-cultural universals in the development of homosexual males appear to exist. For example, in Western cultures, homosexual males exhibit comparatively more gender-nonconforming behavior during childhood than heterosexual males.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Bailey JM|author2=Zucker KJ|title=Childhood sex-typed behavior and sexual orientation: A conceptual analysis and quantitative review|journal=Dev.

This idea would be further supported if it could be demonstrated that causal biological factors, such as the fraternal birth order mechanism (which is biological in nature), are likely to influence the development of male homosexuality in non-Western cultures. Thus, establishing the existence of the fraternal birth order effect — a hypothesized outcome of the fraternal birth order mechanism — in a non-Western culture would further substantiate arguments that similar biological influences underlie the development of homosexuality across cultures. Studies in Western as well as non-Western cultures have demonstrated fraternal birth order effect (as well as fecundity effects) in relation to male homosexuality. The cross-cultural consistency with which these effects have been documented is consistent with the conclusion that culturally invariant, biological processes underlie the development of homosexuality in males.&lt;ref name=VanderLaanVasey2011/&gt;

Most research on the fraternal birth order effect has been carried out on homosexual/gay men (i.e., males who are [[cisgender]] and attracted to adult men).&lt;ref name=Blanchard1997/&gt;&lt;ref name=Blanchardped2000/&gt; Two [[XY sex-determination system|chromosomally male]] groups that are attracted to males but differ most strongly from typical homosexual/gay men are [[androphilic]] male-to-female transsexuals (i.e., [[transgender]] chromosomal males who are attracted to adult men) and same-sex attracted pedophilic-hebephilic men (i.e., cisgender chromosomal males who are attracted to non-adult males).&lt;ref name=Blanchoff1998&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Blanchard R|author2=Bogaert AF|authorlink1=Ray Blanchard|title=Birth order in homosexual versus heterosexual sex offenders against children, pubescents, and adults|journal=Arch Sex Behav|date=1998|volume=27|issue=6|pages=595–603|pmid=9883307|doi=10.1023/A:1018773117741}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Blanchardped2000/&gt;

The fraternal birth order effect has been observed in androphilic male-to-female (MtF) transsexuals: MtF transsexuals who are sexually interested in men (also called "homosexual transsexuals") have a greater number of older brothers than MtF transsexuals who are sexually interested in women (also called "heterosexual transsexuals").

Three studies have investigated whether sexual orientation also correlates with fraternal birth order in men attracted to physically immature males.&lt;ref name=Blanchardped2000 /&gt; One study (Bogaert et al., 1997) found that homosexual-bisexual male pedophiles had a later general birth order than heterosexual male pedophiles and this late birth order was primarily due to the homosexual-bisexual group being born later among their brothers than later among their sisters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Bogaert Anthony F. | year = 1997 | title = Pedophilia, sexual orientation, and birth order | url = http://psycnet.apa.org/journals/abn/106/2/331/ | journal = Journal of Abnormal Psychology | volume = 106 | issue = 2| pages = 331–335 | doi=10.1037/0021-843x.106.2.331|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another study (Blanchard and Bogaert, 1998) did not confirm a later fraternal birth order for men with sexual offenses against prepubescent boys or girls, but did confirm it for men with offenses against pubescent boys or girls.&lt;ref name=Blanchoff1998/&gt; The inconsistency of these findings regarding the correlation of sexual orientation and fraternal birth order in pedophiles may be related to methodological problems in the two studies. The first study was a retrospective study of sex offenders, which included only those subjects whose clinical charts happened to contain birth order data so the results of the study may have been affected by [[selection bias]]. The second study was a reanalysis of archived data from a classic study of sexual offenders from the year 1965. There was minimal recoverable information regarding the subjects' offense histories, and there is a possibility that the sexual preferences of the pedophiles in the study were not accurately classified from the available information.&lt;ref name=Blanchardped2000&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Blanchard R|author2=Barbaree HE|author3=Bogaert AF|author4=Dickey R|author5=Klassen P|author6=Kuban ME|author7=Zucker KJ|authorlink1=Ray Blanchard|title=Fraternal birth order and sexual orientation in pedophiles|journal=Arch Sex Behav|date=2000|volume=29|issue=5|pages=463–78|pmid=10983250|doi=10.1023/A:1001943719964}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Blanchard et al. (2000) therefore conducted a study in which data were collected with the specific purpose of examining the relation of fraternal birth order to sexual orientation in homosexual, bisexual and heterosexual pedophiles. Each type of pedophilic group was compared with a control group that consisted of [[gynephilia|gynephilic]] men (i.e., men attracted to adult females). The study found that homosexual pedophiles had more older brothers than the gynephilic control group while the bisexual and heterosexual pedophiles did not. These results confirm that fraternal birth order correlates with sexual orientation in pedophiles, as it does in teleiophiles (i.e., people exclusively attracted to adults).&lt;ref name=Blanchardped2000/&gt; The results also confirm that fraternal birth order does not correlate with pedophilia per se: Previous studies had established that the fraternal birth order effect affects what gender a man is sexually attracted to; Blanchard et al. (2000) additionally investigated if fraternal birth order also affects the age of persons to whom a man is attracted. Results from the study indicate that fraternal birth order does not affect the age of preferred erotic targets and that fraternal birth order does not correlate with pedophilia. So the fraternal birth order mechanism only causes males to be attracted to other males; whatever mechanism causes males to be pedophilic as opposed to teleiophilic (i.e., attracted to adults) is different from the fraternal birth order mechanism itself.&lt;ref name="Blanchard 2001"/&gt;&lt;ref name=Blanchardped2000/&gt;

Other than fraternal birth order, no common feature has been identified in the developmental histories or family demographics of androphiles and pedophiles, while key features distinguish the two groups, for example, most androphilic males display gender non-conformity during childhood whereas same-sex attracted pedophiles do not.&lt;ref name=Blanchardped2000/&gt;&lt;ref name="FreundBlan87"&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Freund K|author2=Blanchard R|title=Feminine gender identity and physical aggressiveness in heterosexual and homosexual pedophiles|journal=J Sex Marital Ther.|date=1987|volume=13|issue=1|pages=25–34|doi=10.1080/00926238708403876|pmid=3573049}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Freundetal1982"&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Freund K|author2=Scher H|author3=Chan S|author4=Ben-Aron M|title=Experimental analysis of pedophilia|journal=Behav Res Ther|date=1982|volume=20|issue=2|pages=105–12|doi=10.1016/0005-7967(82)90110-3|pmid=7073641}}&lt;/ref&gt; To prevent misunderstanding or misuse of their studies on fraternal birth order in pedophiles, researchers have stressed that any conclusion that homosexual pedophilia shares an etiological factor with androphilia does not imply that ordinary homosexual men (androphiles) are likely to molest boys, any more than the conclusion that heterosexual pedophilia shares an etiological factor with gynephilia would imply that ordinary heterosexual men (gynephiles) are likely to molest girls.&lt;ref name=Blanchard1997/&gt;&lt;ref name=Blanchardped2000/&gt;

The finding of the fraternal birth order effect in cisgender and transgender male androphiles, men attracted to boys and those attracted to adult men—same-sex attracted groups who differ as widely as possible in their own characteristics and in the characteristics of their desired partners—would suggest that fraternal birth order (or the underlying variable it reflects) may be the first universal factor to be identified in development of same-sex attraction in males.&lt;ref name=Blanchardped2000/&gt;

===Other findings===
[[Peter Bearman|Bearman]] and Brückner (2002) argued that studies showing a fraternal birth order effect have used nonrepresentative samples and/or indirect reports on siblings' sexual orientation.  Their analysis, focusing on opposite-sex twins, did not find an association "between same-sex attraction and number of older siblings, older brothers, or older sisters".&lt;ref name="Bearman"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Bearman|first=Peter|author2=Brückner, Hannah|year=2002|title=Opposite-sex twins and adolescent same-sex attraction|journal=American Journal of Sociology|volume=107|issue=5|url=http://www.soc.duke.edu/~jmoody77/205a/ecp/bearman_bruckner_ajs.pdf|format=PDF|pages=1179–1205|doi=10.1086/341906}}&lt;/ref&gt; A study by Francis (2008), using the same Add Health survey but with broader analysis, saw a very weak correlation of male same-sex attraction with having multiple older brothers (but did find a significant negative correlation of male same-sex attraction with having older sisters i.e., those who experienced a non-zero level of same-sex attraction were significantly less likely to have older sisters).&lt;ref name="Francis"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Francis|first=Andrew M.|year=2008|title=Family and sexual orientation: the family-demographic correlates of homosexuality in men and women|journal=Journal of Sex Research|volume=45|issue=4|url=http://userwww.service.emory.edu/~afranc5/Family%20and%20Sexual%20Orientation.pdf|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090616234247/http://userwww.service.emory.edu/~afranc5/Family%20and%20Sexual%20Orientation.pdf|dead-url=yes|archive-date=2009-06-16|format=PDF|pages=371–377|doi=10.1080/00224490802398357}}&lt;/ref&gt;

If the homosexual study group has too few siblings, in comparison to the heterosexual study group, the homosexual group will tend to show no difference in number of older brothers and may show a scarcity of other sibling types (most commonly younger brothers and younger sisters). If the homosexual study group has too many siblings, it will not only show the expected excess of older brothers but may also show an excess of other sibling types (most commonly older sisters). In his three-part article, Blanchard first demonstrated the aforementioned outcomes using purposely mismatched groups selected from archived data sets. In the second part, Blanchard presented two different methods for transforming raw sibling data. Both methods intended to "produce family-size-corrected variables for each of the four original sibling parameters (older brothers, older sisters, younger brothers, and younger sisters)."&lt;ref name=Blanchardfamilysize /&gt; Consequently, both methods were successful in demonstrating the fraternal birth order effect in the purposely mismatched groups.

Currin et al. (2015) carried out a study investigating the existence of the fraternal birth order effect in a variety of sexual orientation dimensions — namely, identity, attraction, fantasies, and behavior — whereas previous research studied only one such dimension (identity). Participants in the study were split into two groups: a "heterosexual group" and a "non-heterosexual" group. To determine what label participants used to identify their sexual orientation, participants were asked, "How would you classify your sexual orientation?" and selected from one of five options (heterosexual, mostly heterosexual, bisexual, mostly gay/lesbian, gay/lesbian). People who selected "heterosexual" were place in the heterosexual group, whereas people selecting "gay/lesbian" were placed in the non-heterosexual group. To assess sexual attraction, participants were asked, "How sexually attracted are you to men?" and selected from a 7-point [[Likert scale]] ranging from 1 (not at all) to 7 (very much). Participants were also asked "How sexually attracted are you to women?" and were presented with the same Likert scale. People who selected 1 (not at all) when answering the same sex sexual attraction question were placed in the heterosexual group. People who selected 2 or greater were placed in the non-heterosexual group.

To assess sexual behavior, participants were asked, "What is the total number of male sexual partners you have had?" and "What is the total number of female sexual partners you have had?" ''Sexual partner'' was defined as someone with whom the participant had penile–vaginal penetration, oral sex, anal sex, and/or mutual masturbation. Individuals who identified having any same-sex sexual partner (i.e., 1 or more) were placed in the non-heterosexual group while individuals who did not identify having a same-sex sexual partner were placed in the heterosexual group.&lt;ref name=curr&gt;{{cite journal|title=Multidimensional Assessment of Sexual Orientation and the Fraternal Birth Order Effect|doi=10.1037/sgd0000103|year=2015|volume=2|issue=2|pages=113–122|author=Joseph M.

If an individual endorsed having any same-sex sexual fantasies at all (i.e., 1% or greater), they were placed in the non-heterosexual group, otherwise they were placed in the heterosexual group. Using these criteria for sexual orientation identity, attraction, fantasies, and behavior, Currin et al. (2015) were unable to demonstrate the effect for any dimensions in their sample of 722 right-handed men (of which 500 were classified as heterosexual and 122 were classified as non-heterosexual), although the study did adjust for family size differences between the two groups.&lt;ref name=curr/&gt; A 2017 [[meta-analysis]] analyzed studies about the fraternal birth order effect including Currin et al. (2015). The meta-analysis had a total sample of 7140 homosexual males and 12,837 heterosexual males. The results of the meta-analysis confirmed the reliability of the fraternal birth order effect.&lt;ref name="2017meta-analysis"/&gt;

However, in a large study not included in the above-mentioned meta-analysis, Frisch et al. (2006) also failed to notice a correlation between older brothers and same-sex unions between men in a sample of over 2 million Danes. Instead, researchers found a correlation between such unions and having an excess of older ''sisters''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Childhood family correlates of heterosexual and homosexual marriages: a national cohort study of two million Danes|year=2006|journal=Archives of Sexual Behavior|volume=35|issue=5|pages=533–47|author1=Frisch M|author2=Hviid A|doi=10.1007/s10508-006-9062-2|pmid=17039403}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Theories about the fraternal birth order mechanism==
Anthony Bogaert's work involving adoptees concludes that the effect is not due to being raised with older brothers, but is hypothesized to have something to do with changes induced in the mother's body when [[gestation|gestating]] a boy that affects subsequent sons. This is because the effect is present regardless of whether or not the older brothers are raised in the same family environment with the boy. There is no effect when the number of older brothers is increased by adopted brothers or stepbrothers.  An in-utero maternal immune response has been hypothesized for this effect.&lt;ref name="Blanchard 2001"/&gt;&lt;ref name=BlanBog96 /&gt;&lt;ref name=BlanchardQuan04 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Blanchard97&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Blanchard R, Klassen P |title=H-Y antigen and homosexuality in men |journal=J.

McConaghy (2006) concluded that the influence of birth order on degree of homosexual feelings was due not to a biological, but to a social process, in a study in which he
investigated birth order in men and women who anonymously reported "some" homosexual feelings, few of whom identified as homosexual. He found a fraternal birth order effect in men who reported homosexual feelings and when comparing the strength of the effect and degree of homosexual feelings (rather than homosexual identity or homosexual behavior) he found no relationship between the two.&lt;ref name=McConaghy06&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=McConaghy N, Hadzi-Pavlovic D, Stevens C, Manicavasagar V, Buhrich N, Vollmer-Conna U |title=Fraternal birth order and ratio of heterosexual/homosexual feelings in women and men |journal=J Homosex |volume=51 |issue=4 |pages=161–74 |year=2006 |pmid=17135133 |doi=10.1300/J082v51n04_09 }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, multiple studies have demonstrated that the fraternal birth order effect does not operate through social or postnatal (e.g., learning or rearing or environmental) mechanisms; rather it is biological in nature and operates prenatally.&lt;ref name = Bogaert2006/&gt;&lt;ref name=BogaertSkorskaReview11 /&gt;&lt;ref name=BlanCanBreeEll06/&gt;&lt;ref name=Bogaertantbem03&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Bogaert AF|title=Interaction of older brothers and sex-typing in the prediction of sexual orientation in men|journal=Arch Sex Behav|date=April 2003|volume=32|issue=2|pages=129–34|doi=10.1023/A:1022827524721|pmid=12710827|issn=1573-2800}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=WilsonRahman/&gt; It is also known that the fraternal birth order effect on male sexual orientation is unaffected by family dynamics, living with older brothers or learning.&lt;ref name=WilsonRahman&gt;{{cite book|author1=Rahman Q|author2=Wilson G|authorlink2=Glenn Wilson (psychologist)|title=Born Gay: The Psychobiology of Sex Orientation|date=2005|publisher=Peter Owen Publishers|location=London|isbn=0720613094}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8746">A '''frozen zoo''' is a storage facility in which genetic materials taken from animals (e.g. [[DNA]], [[sperm]], [[Egg (biology)|eggs]], [[embryos]] and live tissue) are stored at very low temperatures  (−196&amp;nbsp;°C) in tanks of liquid nitrogen.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://archiwum.wiz.pl/1997/97122600.asp|title=ZAMROŻONE ZOO|author=Magdalena Pecul| publisher=„Wiedza i Życie”|date=December 1997|accessdate=2010-04-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; Material preserved in this way can be stored indefinitely&lt;ref name=AudubonFZ /&gt; and used for [[artificial insemination]], [[in vitro fertilisation]], embryo transfer, and [[cloning]]. Some facilities also collect and cryopreserve plant material (usually seeds).

The first frozen zoo was established at the [[San Diego Zoo]] by pathologist [[Kurt Benirschke]] in 1972.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.the-scientist.com/news-opinion/conservation-biologist-and-placenta-expert-kurt-benirschke-dies-64809|title=Conservation Biologist and Placenta Expert Kurt Benirschke Dies; He established the San Diego Zoo’s cryopreserved Frozen Zoo.|last=Williams|first=Shawna|date=September 14, 2018|work=The Scientist|accessdate=2 December 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="guardian"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2010/aug/29/frozen-zoo-san-diego-rhino|title=The Frozen Zoo aiming to bring endangered species back from the brink|last=Harris|first=Paul|date=August 28, 2010|work=The Guardian|accessdate=2 December 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2002/10/14/tech/main525521.shtml|author=Dan Collins|title=San Diego's Frozen Zoo|publisher=The [[Associated Press]] and [[CBS News]]|date=2002-10-14 |accessdate=2010-04-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the time there was no technology available to make use of the collection, but Benirschke believed such technology would be developed in the future.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://mashable.com/2017/02/28/san-diego-frozen-zoo/#mgh8BlFlaqqm|title=Extinct animals find new futures at the 'frozen zoo'|last1=Squarci|first1=Gaia|last2=Cornet|first2=Laurence|date=February 28, 2017|work=Mashable|accessdate=2 December 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The frozen zoo idea was later supported in Gregory Benford's 1992 paper proposing a Library of Life.&lt;ref&gt; Gregory Benford, Nov, 15, 1992.

Gathering material for a frozen zoo is rendered simple by the abundance of [[sperm]] in males. Sperm can be taken from an animal following death. The production of eggs, which in females is usually low, can be increased through [[hormone treatment]] to obtain 10–20 [[oocyte]]s, dependent on the species. Some frozen zoos prefer to fertilize eggs and freeze the resulting embryo, as embryos are more resilient under the cryopreservation process.&lt;ref name=Sharjah /&gt; Some centers also collect skin cell samples of endangered animals or extinct species. The [[Scripps Research Institute]] has successfully made skin cells into cultures of special cells called induced pluripotent stem cells ([[Induced pluripotent stem cell|IPS cells]]). It is theoretically possible to make sperm and egg cells from these IPS cells.&lt;ref name = "guardian"/&gt; 

==Existing frozen zoos==
The Frozen Zoo at the San Diego Zoo's Institute for Conservation Research currently stores a collection of  8,400 samples from over 800 species and subspecies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sandiegozoo.org/conservation/science/at_the_zoo/the_frozen_zoo/|title=Chill Out: Frozen Zoo Aiding Conservation Projects|publisher=San Diego Zoo|accessdate=2010-04-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; Frozen Zoo at San Diego Zoo Conservation Research has acted as a forbearer to similar projects at other zoos in the United States and Europe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.zsl.org/zsl-london-zoo/whats-on/scientific-meeting-frozen-ark,234,EV.html|title=Scientific Meeting - The Frozen Ark Project|publisher=ZSL London Zoo|accessdate=2010-04-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.frozenark.org/|title=Welcome to the Frozen Ark|publisher=The Frozen Ark Project|accessdate=2010-04-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, there are still less than a dozen frozen zoos worldwide.&lt;ref name=AudubonFZ /&gt;

At the United Arab Emirates Breeding Centre for Endangered Arabian Wildlife (BCEAW), [[Sharjah (city)|Sharjah]], the embryos stored include the extremely endangered [[Gordon’s wildcat]] (''Felis silvestris gordoni'') and the [[Arabian leopard]] (''Panthera pardus nimr'') (of which there are only 50 in the wild).&lt;ref name=Sharjah&gt;{{cite web|url=http://arabianwildlife.uaeinteract.com/current/fr_zoo.html|title=The Frozen Zoo: Breeding Centre for Endangered Arabian Wildlife, Sharjah, UAE|author=F.J. de Haas van Dorsser MA VetMB MRCVS|publisher=Arabian Wildlife|accessdate=2010-04-26|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100521054237/http://arabianwildlife.uaeinteract.com/current/fr_zoo.html|archivedate=2010-05-21|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Audubon Center for Research of Endangered Species, affiliated with the [[University of New Orleans]], is maintaining a frozen zoo. In 2000 the Center implanted a frozen-thawed embryo from the highly endangered African wildcat into the uterus of a domestic house cat, resulting in a healthy male wildcat.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2001/03/010309080531.htm|title=The Frozen Zoo: The University Of New Orleans And The New World Of Saving Endangered Species|date=March 12, 2001|work=Science Daily|accessdate=2 December 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Frozen Ark]] is a frozen zoo established in 2004 and jointly managed by the [[Zoological Society of London]], the [[London Natural History Museum]], and the [[University of Nottingham]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

The University of Georgia's Regenerative Bioscience Center is building a frozen zoo. RBC Director Steven Stice and animal and dairy science assistant professor Franklin West created the facility with the thought of saving endangered cat species. The scientists have already extracted cells from a Sumatran tiger, which could be used for artificial insemination. Artificial insemination provides a remedy for animals who, due to anatomical or physiological reasons, are unable to reproduce in the natural way. Reproduction of stored genetic material also allows for the fostering of genetic improvements, and the prevention of inbreeding. Modern technology allows for genetic manipulation in animals without keeping them in captivity. However, the success of their restoration into the wild would require the application of new science and a sufficient amount of previously collected material.&lt;ref name=Sharjah /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5068">The '''global hectare''' (gha) is a measurement unit for the [[ecological footprint]] of people or activities and the [[biocapacity]] of the [[earth]] or its regions. One global hectare is the world's annual amount of biological production for human use and human waste assimilation, per hectare of biologically productive land and fisheries.

It measures production and consumption of different products. It starts with the total biological production and waste assimilation in the world, including crops, forests (both wood production and CO2 absorption), grazing and fishing.&lt;ref name="borucke2013"&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Borucke |first=Michael |last2=Moore |first2=David |last3=Cranston |first3=Gemma |last4=Gracey |first4=Kyle |last5=Iha |first5=Katsunori |last6=Larson |first6=Joy |last7=Lazarus |first7=Elias |last8=Morales |first8=Juan Carlos |last9=Wackernagel |first9=Mathis |title=Accounting for demand and supply of the biosphere's regenerative capacity: The National Footprint Accounts’ underlying methodology and framework |url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ecolind.2012.08.005 |department=The Living Planet Report 2016 cites this paper to explain the "conversion from actual land areas to global hectares." |journal=Ecological Indicators |volume=24 |pages=518–533 |doi=10.1016/j.ecolind.2012.08.005}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The total of these kinds of production, weighted by the richness of the land they use,&lt;ref name="borucke2013" /&gt; is divided by the number of hectares used. The calculation does not include [[desert]]s, [[glacier]]s, and the [[open ocean]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Frequently Asked Questions|url=http://www.footprintnetwork.org/en/index.php/GFN/page/frequently_asked_questions/#method2|work=Footprint Basics|publisher=[[Global Footprint Network]]|accessdate=8 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

"Global hectares per person" refers to the amount of production and waste assimilation per person on the planet. In 2012 there were approximately 12.2 billion global hectares of production and waste assimilation, averaging 1.7 global hectares per person.&lt;ref name="lpr2016"&gt;{{Cite book |url=http://wwf.panda.org/about_our_earth/all_publications/lpr_2016/ |title=Living Planet Report 2016 |last=WWF |publisher=WWF International |year=2016 |isbn=978-2-940529-40-7 |location=Gland, Switzerland |pages=77 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Consumption totaled 20.1 billion global hectares or 2.8 global hectares per person, meaning about 65% more was consumed than produced. This is possible because there are natural reserves all around the globe that function as backup food, material and energy supplies, although only for a relatively short period of time. Due to rapid population growth, these reserves are being depleted at an ever increasing tempo. See [[Earth Overshoot Day]].

Opponents and defenders of the concept have discussed its strengths and weaknesses.&lt;ref name="question"&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Galli |first=Alessandro |last2=Giampietro |first2=Mario |last3=Goldfinger |first3=Steve |last4=Lazarus |first4=Elias |last5=Lin |first5=David |last6=Saltelli |first6=Andrea |last7=Wackernagel |first7=Mathis |last8=Müller |first8=Felix |title=Questioning the Ecological Footprint |url=http://www.andreasaltelli.eu/file/repository/footprint_PUBLISHED.pdf |journal=Ecological Indicators |volume=69 |pages=224–232 |doi=10.1016/j.ecolind.2016.04.014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Applications==
The global hectare is a useful measure of biocapacity as it can convert things like [[Human#Diet|human dietary requirements]] into common units, which can show how many [[people]] a certain region on earth can sustain, assuming current [[technology|technologies]] and [[agriculture|agricultural]] methods. It can be used as a way of determining the relative carrying capacity of the earth.

Different hectares of land can provide different amounts of global hectares. For example, a hectare of lush area with high [[rainfall]] would scale higher in global hectares than would a hectare of desert.

It can also be used to show that consuming different foods may increase the earth's ability to support larger populations. To illustrate, [[meat production|producing meat]] generally requires more land and energy than what producing vegetables requires; sustaining a meat-based diet would require a less populated planet.

==Hectare equivalents==
On average, a global hectare can be produced in the area of a standard hectare. A [[hectare]] ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|h|ɛ|k|t|ɛər}}; symbol '''ha''') is a unit of area equal to {{convert|10000|m2|sigfig=6}} (a square 100 metres on each side or 328 feet on each side), 2.471 acres, 0.01 square kilometers, 0.00386102 square miles, or one square [[hectometre]] (100 metres squared).

{{Science}}



==A==
*'''[[Height above ground level|Above ground level]]''' — In [[aviation]], [[atmospheric sciences]] and [[broadcasting]], a '''height above ground level''' ('''AGL'''&lt;ref name="CAP413"&gt;{{cite book | date=28 May 2015 | title=Radiotelephony Manual |publisher=UK Civil Aviation Authority| id=CAP413| isbn=9780 11792 893 0}}&lt;/ref&gt;) is a [[height#In aviation|height]] measured with respect to the underlying [[earth's surface|ground surface]]. This is as opposed to altitude/elevation [[above mean sea level]] (AMSL), or (in [[broadcast engineering]]) [[height above average terrain]] (HAAT). In other words, these expressions (AGL, AMSL, HAAT) indicate where the "zero level" or "reference altitude" is located.
*'''[[Absolute humidity]]''' — describes the water content of air and is expressed in either grams per cubic meter&lt;ref&gt;Wyer, S.S., "A treatise on producer-gas and gas-producers", (1906) The Engineering and Mining Journal, London, p.23&lt;/ref&gt; or grams per kilogram&lt;ref&gt;Perry, R.H. and Green, D.W, (2007) ''[[Perry's Chemical Engineers' Handbook]]'' (8th Edition),  Section 12, Psychrometry, Evaporative Cooling and Solids Drying [[McGraw-Hill]], {{ISBN|978-0-07-151135-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;. 
*'''[[Absolute value]]''' — In [[mathematics]], the '''absolute value''' or '''modulus''' {{math|{{!}}''x''{{!}}}} of a [[real number]]&amp;nbsp;{{mvar|x}} is the [[non-negative]] value of&amp;nbsp;{{mvar|x}} without regard to its [[sign (mathematics)|sign]]. Namely, {{math|1={{!}}''x''{{!}} = ''x''}} for a [[positive number|positive]]&amp;nbsp;{{mvar|x}}, {{math|1={{!}}''x''{{!}} = −''x''}} for a [[negative number|negative]]&amp;nbsp;{{mvar|x}} (in which case {{math|−''x''}} is positive), and {{math|1={{!}}0{{!}} = 0}}. For example, the absolute value of 3 is 3, and the absolute value of −3 is also 3. The absolute value of a number may be thought of as its [[distance]] from zero.
*'''[[Acceleration]]''' —  In [[physics]], '''acceleration''' is the [[Rate (mathematics)|rate]] of change of [[velocity]] of an object with respect to time. An object's acceleration is the net result of any and all [[force]]s acting on the object, as described by [[Newton's Second Law]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Principles of Mechanics |first=Henry |last=Crew |publisher=BiblioBazaar, LLC |year=2008 |isbn=978-0-559-36871-4 |pages=43}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[International System of Units|SI]] unit for acceleration is [[metre per second squared]] {{nowrap|(m s&lt;sup&gt;−2&lt;/sup&gt;).}} Accelerations are [[Euclidean vector|vector]] quantities (they have [[Magnitude (mathematics)|magnitude]] and [[Direction (geometry)|direction]]) and add according to the [[parallelogram law]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Relativity and Common Sense |first=Hermann |last=Bondi |pages=3 |publisher=Courier Dover Publications |year=1980 |isbn=978-0-486-24021-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Physics the Easy Way |pages=27 |first=Robert L. |last=Lehrman |publisher=Barron's Educational Series |year=1998 |isbn=978-0-7641-0236-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;  As a [[Vector space|vector]], the calculated net [[force]] is equal to the product of the object's mass (a [[Scalar (physics)|scalar]] quantity) and its acceleration.
*'''[[Acquisition of signal]]''' —  A '''pass''', in [[spaceflight]] and [[satellite communications]], is the period in which a [[satellite]] or other [[spacecraft]] is above the [[Horizontal coordinate system|local horizon]] and available for [[radio]] communication with a particular [[ground station]], [[satellite receiver]], or relay satellite (or, in some cases, for visual sighting). The beginning of a pass is termed ''acquisition of signal''; the end of a pass is termed ''loss of signal''.&lt;ref name=NLSA&gt;{{cite web|title=AOS, TCA, and LOS|url=http://www.nlsa.com/definitions/aos_defined.html|publisher=Northern Lights Software Associates|accessdate=17 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The point at which a spacecraft comes closest to a ground observer is the ''time of closest approach''.&lt;ref name=NLSA/&gt;
*'''[[Action (physics)|Action]]''' — In [[physics]], '''action''' is an attribute of the [[dynamics (physics)|dynamics]] of a [[physical system]] from which the [[equations of motion]] of the system can be derived. It is a [[functional (mathematics)|mathematical functional]] which takes the [[trajectory]], also called ''path'' or ''history'', of the system as its argument and has a [[real number]] as its result. Generally, the action takes different values for different paths.&lt;ref name="mcgraw1"&gt;McGraw Hill Encyclopaedia of Physics (2nd Edition), C.B. Parker, 1994, {{ISBN|0-07-051400-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Action has the [[dimensional analysis|dimensions]] of [[energy|[energy]]]⋅[[time|[time]]] or [[momentum|[momentum]]]⋅[[length|[length]]], and its [[SI unit]] is [[joule]]-second.
*'''[[Automatic direction finder|ADF]]''' —Automatic direction finder
*'''[[Advanced Space Vision System]]''' — The '''Advanced Space Vision System''' (also known as the Space Vision System or by its acronym SVS) is a  [[computer vision]] system designed primarily for [[International Space Station]] (ISS) assembly.&lt;ref name="nrcc"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.nrc-cnrc.gc.ca/eng/education/innovations/discoveries/svs.html|title=Space Vision System Helps Astronauts See in Space|accessdate=February 13, 2008|publisher=National Research Council of Canada|year=2008|author=NRCC|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080603143525/http://www.nrc-cnrc.gc.ca/eng/education/innovations/discoveries/svs.html|archivedate=June 3, 2008|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The system uses regular 2D cameras in the [[Space Shuttle]] bay, on the [[Canadarm]], or on the ISS along with cooperative targets to calculate the 3D position of an object.&lt;ref name="nrcc"/&gt;
*'''[[Aeroacoustics]]''' — Is a branch of [[acoustics]] that studies noise generation via either [[turbulent]] fluid motion or [[aerodynamic]] forces interacting with surfaces. Noise generation can also be associated with periodically varying flows.  A notable example of this phenomenon is the [[Aeolian sound|Aeolian tones]] produced by wind blowing over fixed objects.
*'''[[Aerobraking]]''' — is a [[spaceflight]] maneuver that reduces the high point of an [[elliptical orbit]] ([[apoapsis]]) by flying the vehicle through the [[atmosphere]] at the low point of the [[orbit]] ([[periapsis]]). The resulting [[Drag (physics)|drag]] slows the [[spacecraft]]. Aerobraking is used when a spacecraft requires a low orbit after arriving at a body with an atmosphere, and it requires less fuel than does the direct use of a [[rocket engine]].
*'''[[Aerocapture]]''' —  is an [[Orbital maneuver|orbital transfer maneuver]] used to reduce the velocity of a spacecraft from a [[hyperbolic trajectory]] to an elliptical orbit around the targeted celestial body.
*'''[[Aerodynamics]]''' — is the study of the motion of [[air]], particularly its interaction with a solid object, such as an [[airplane]] wing. It is a sub-field of [[fluid dynamics]] and [[gas dynamics]], and many aspects of aerodynamics theory are common to these fields. 
*'''[[Aeroelasticity]]''' — is the branch of [[physics]] and [[engineering]] that studies the interactions between the [[inertial force|inertial]], [[elasticity (physics)|elastic]], and [[aerodynamic force|aerodynamic]] forces that occur when an elastic body is exposed to a [[fluid]] flow. Although historical studies have been focused on aeronautical applications, recent research has found applications in fields such as [[energy harvesting]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Sousa|first=V. C.|title=Enhanced aeroelastic energy harvesting by exploiting combined nonlinearities: theory and experiment|journal=Smart Materials and Structures|year=2011|volume=20|number=9}}&lt;/ref&gt; and understanding [[snoring]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Ellis|first= P. D. M. |title= Laser palatoplasty for snoring due to palatal flutter: a further report|journal= Clinical Otolaryngology|year=1994|volume=19|number=4}}&lt;/ref&gt; The study of aeroelasticity may be broadly classified into two fields: static aeroelasticity, which deals with the static or [[steady state|steady]] response of an elastic body to a fluid flow; and dynamic aeroelasticity, which deals with the body's [[Dynamics (mechanics)|dynamic]] (typically [[vibration]]al) response. Aeroelasticity draws on the study of [[fluid mechanics]], [[solid mechanics]], [[structural dynamics]] and [[dynamical systems]]. The synthesis of aeroelasticity with [[thermodynamics]] is known as aerothermoelasticity, and its synthesis with [[control theory]] is known as aeroservoelasticity.
*'''[[Aeronautics]]''' — Is the science or art involved with the study, [[design process|design]], and manufacturing of air [[flight]] capable machines, and the techniques of operating [[aircraft]] and rockets within the [[atmosphere]].
*'''[[Aerospace architecture]]''' — is broadly defined to encompass [[architecture|architectural]] design of non-habitable and habitable structures and living and working environments in aerospace-related facilities, habitats, and vehicles. These environments include, but are not limited to: science platform aircraft and aircraft-deployable systems; [[space vehicle]]s, [[space station]]s, habitats and lunar and [[planetary surface construction]] bases; and Earth-based control, experiment, launch, logistics, payload, simulation and test facilities. Earth analogs to space applications may include Antarctic, desert, high altitude, underground, undersea environments and closed ecological systems.
*'''[[Aerospace bearing]]''' — '''Aerospace bearings''' are the bearings installed in [[aircraft]] and [[aerospace]] systems including commercial, private, military, or space applications.
*'''[[Aerospace engineering]]''' — is the primary field of [[engineering]] concerned with the development of [[aircraft]] and [[spacecraft]].&lt;ref&gt;''Encyclopedia of Aerospace Engineering''. [[John Wiley &amp; Sons]], 2010. {{ISBN|978-0-470-75440-5}}.&lt;/ref&gt;  It has two major and overlapping branches: Aeronautical engineering and Astronautical Engineering.  [[Avionics]] engineering is similar, but deals with the [[electronic engineering|electronics]] side of aerospace engineering.
*'''[[Aerospace materials]]''' — are materials, frequently [[alloy|metal alloy]]s, that have either been developed for, or have come to prominence through, their use for [[aerospace]] purposes. These uses often require exceptional performance, strength or heat resistance, even at the cost of considerable expense in their production or machining. Others are chosen for their long-term reliability in this safety-conscious field, particularly for their resistance to [[fatigue (material)|fatigue]].
*'''[[Aerospike engine]]''' — is a type of [[rocket engine]] that maintains its [[aerodynamic]] efficiency across a wide range of [[altitude]]s. It belongs to the class of [[altitude compensating nozzle]] engines. A vehicle with an aerospike engine uses 25–30% less fuel at low altitudes, where most missions have the greatest need for [[thrust]].
*'''[[Aerostat]]''' — is a [[lighter than air]] aircraft that gains its lift through the use of a buoyant gas. Aerostats include unpowered [[balloon (aircraft)|balloons]] and powered [[airship]]s.
*'''[[Aerostructure]]''' — is a component of an [[aircraft]]'s airframe. This may include all or part of the [[fuselage]], [[wing]]s, or flight control surfaces.
*'''[[Aft-crossing trajectory]]''' — is an alternate flight path for a rocket. The rocket's rotation (induced by the deployment from the aircraft) is slowed by a small [[parachute]] attached to its tail, then ignited once the carrier aircraft has passed it.  It is ignited before it is pointing fully vertically, however it will turn to do so, and accelerates to pass behind the carrier aircraft. 
*'''[[Above ground level|AGL]]''' — Above ground level
*'''[[Aileron]]''' — is a hinged [[flight control surface]] usually forming part of the [[trailing edge]] of each [[wing]] of a [[fixed-wing aircraft]]. Ailerons are used in pairs to control the aircraft in [[Flight dynamics|roll]] (or movement around the aircraft's [[Flight control surfaces#Longitudinal axis|longitudinal axis]]), which normally results in a change in flight path due to the tilting of the [[Lift (force)|lift vector]].  Movement around this axis is called 'rolling' or 'banking'.
*'''[[Air-augmented rocket]]''' —
*'''[[Aircraft]]''' — is a [[machine]] that is able to [[flight|fly]] by gaining support from the [[air]].&lt;!--English word "aircraft" is singular and plural with no "s".

*'''[[Aircraft flight control systems]]''' — A conventional [[Fixed-wing aircraft|fixed-wing]] '''aircraft flight control system''' consists of [[flight control surfaces]], the respective cockpit controls, connecting linkages, and the necessary operating mechanisms to control an aircraft's direction in flight. [[Aircraft engine controls]] are also considered as flight controls as they change speed.
*'''[[Aircraft flight mechanics]]''' —
*'''[[Airfoil]]''' — An '''airfoil''' ([[American English]]) or '''aerofoil''' ([[British English]]) is the cross-sectional shape of a [[wing]], blade (of a [[Propeller (aeronautics)|propeller]], [[Helicopter rotor|rotor]], or [[turbine]]), or [[sail]] (as seen in [[Multiview orthographic projection#Section|cross-section]]).
*'''[[Airlock]]''' — is a device which permits the passage of people and objects between a [[pressure vessel]] and its surroundings while minimizing the change of [[pressure]] in the vessel and loss of [[air]] from it.  The lock consists of a small chamber with two [[Hermetic seal|airtight]] [[door]]s in series which do not open simultaneously.
*'''[[Airship]]''' — An '''airship''' or '''dirigible balloon''' is a type of [[aerostat]] or lighter-than-air aircraft that can navigate through the air under its own power.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/airship|title=Definition of AIRSHIP|work=merriam-webster.com|accessdate=4 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Aerostats gain their lift from large gas bags filled with a [[lifting gas]] that is less dense than the surrounding air.
*'''[[Albedo]]''' — is the measure of the [[diffuse reflection]] of [[sunlight|solar radiation]] out of the total [[solar radiation]] received by an [[astronomical body]] (e.g. a [[planet]] like [[Earth]]). It is [[dimensionless number|dimensionless]] and measured on a scale from 0 (corresponding to a [[black body]] that absorbs all incident radiation) to 1 (corresponding to a body that reflects all incident radiation).
*'''[[Anemometer]]''' — is a device used for measuring [[wind speed]], and is also a common [[weather station]] instrument. The term is derived from the Greek word ''anemos'', which means [[wind]], and is used to describe any wind speed instrument used in [[meteorology]].
*'''[[Angle of attack]]''' —  In [[fluid dynamics]], '''angle of attack''' ('''AOA''', or '''&lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt;''') is the [[angle]] between a [[Airfoil#Airfoil terminology|reference line]] on a body (often the [[chord (aircraft)|chord line]] of an [[airfoil]]) and the [[vector (geometry)|vector]] representing the relative motion between the body and the fluid through which it is moving.&lt;ref name="nasa"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.grc.nasa.gov/WWW/k-12/airplane/incline.html|title=NASA aeronautics guided tour}}&lt;/ref&gt; Angle of attack is the angle between the body's reference line and the oncoming flow. 
*'''[[Angular momentum]]''' — In [[physics]], '''angular momentum''' (rarely, '''moment of momentum''' or '''rotational momentum''') is the rotational equivalent of [[linear momentum]]. It is an important quantity in physics because it is a [[Conservation law|conserved quantity]]—the total angular momentum of a system remains constant unless acted on by an external [[torque]].
*'''[[Angular velocity]]''' — In [[physics]], the '''angular velocity''' of a particle is the rate at which it rotates around a chosen center point: that is, the time rate of change of its [[angular displacement]] relative to the origin (i.e. in layman's terms: how quickly an object goes around something over a period of time - e.g. how fast the earth orbits the sun). It is measured in angle per unit time, [[radians per second]] in [[SI]] units, and is usually represented by the symbol [[omega]] ('''ω''', sometimes '''Ω'''). By convention, positive angular velocity indicates counter-clockwise rotation, while negative is clockwise.
*'''[[Anticyclone]]''' — An '''anticyclone''' (that is, opposite to a [[cyclone]]) is a [[weather]] [[meteorological phenomenon|phenomenon]] defined by the United States [[National Weather Service]]'s glossary as "a large-scale circulation of winds around a central region of high atmospheric pressure, clockwise in the Northern Hemisphere, counterclockwise in the Southern Hemisphere".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=|title=Glossary: Anticyclone|date=|publisher=National Weather Service|accessdate=January 19, 2010|url=http://www.nws.noaa.gov/glossary/index.php?word=anticyclone|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110629140523/http://www.nws.noaa.gov/glossary/index.php?word=anticyclone|archivedate=June 29, 2011|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
*'''[[Antimatter rocket]]''' — is a proposed class of [[rocket]]s that use [[antimatter]] as their power source. There are several designs that attempt to accomplish this goal. The advantage to this class of rocket is that a large fraction of the [[rest mass]] of a matter/antimatter mixture may be converted to energy, allowing antimatter rockets to have a far higher [[energy density]] and [[specific impulse]] than any other proposed class of rocket.
*'''[[Apsis]]''' — is an extreme point in the [[orbit]] of an [[physical body|object]]. The word comes via Latin from Greek and is [[cognate]] with ''[[apse]]''.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/apsis|title=the definition of apsis|website=Dictionary.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; For [[elliptic orbit]]s about a larger body, there are two apsides, named with the prefixes ''peri-'' ({{ety||''περί'' (peri)|near}}) and ''ap-''/''apo-'' ({{ety||''ἀπ(ό)'' (ap(ó))|away from}}) added to a reference to the [[primary (astronomy)|body being orbited]].
*'''[[Arcjet rocket]]''' — or '''arcjet thruster''' is a form of [[electrically powered spacecraft propulsion]], in which an electrical discharge (arc) is created in a flow of propellant&lt;ref&gt;John, R. R., Bennett, S., and Connors, J. P., "Arcjet Engine Performance: Experiment and Theory," ''AIAA Journal, Vol. 1,'' No. 11, Nov. 1963.

This imparts additional energy to the propellant, so that one can extract more work out of each kilogram of propellant, at the expense of increased power consumption and (usually) higher cost.  Also, the [[thrust]] levels available from typically used arcjet engines are very low compared with chemical engines.
*'''[[Areal velocity]]''' — In [[classical mechanics]], '''areal velocity''' (also called '''sector velocity''' or '''sectorial velocity''') is the rate at which [[area]] is swept out by a particle as it moves along a [[curve]].

*'''[[Radio direction finder#Automatic direction finder (ADF)|Automatic direction finder]]''' —
*'''[[Aspect ratio (aeronautics)]]''' — In [[aeronautics]], the '''aspect ratio''' of a [[wing]] is the ratio of its [[Wingspan|span]] to its mean [[chord (aircraft)|chord]]. It is equal to the square of the wingspan divided by the wing area. Thus, a long, narrow wing has a high aspect ratio, whereas a short, wide wing has a low aspect ratio.&lt;ref name="Kermode"&gt;Kermode, A.C. (1972), ''Mechanics of Flight'', Chapter 3, (p.103, eighth edition), Pitman Publishing Limited, London {{ISBN|0-273-31623-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; Aspect ratio and other features of the [[Planform (aeronautics)|planform]] are often used to predict the aerodynamic efficiency of a wing because the [[lift-to-drag ratio]] increases with aspect ratio, improving [[fuel economy in aircraft]].

The beam is typically either a [[microwave]] or a [[laser]] beam and it is either pulsed or continuous.  A continuous beam lends itself to [[thermal rocket]]s, [[Photonic laser thruster|photonic thrusters]] and [[light sail]]s, whereas a pulsed beam lends itself to ablative thrusters and [[pulse detonation engine]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Breakthrough|title=Progress in beamed energy propulsion {{!}} Kevin Parkin|date=2018-05-29|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnvHNoYuTpI|accessdate=2018-06-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

*'''[[Buoyancy]]''' — In [[physics]], '''buoyancy''' or '''upthrust''', is an upward [[force]] exerted by a [[fluid]] that opposes the [[weight]] of an immersed object. In a column of fluid, pressure increases with depth as a result of the weight of the overlying fluid. Thus the pressure at the bottom of a column of fluid is greater than at the top of the column. Similarly, the pressure at the bottom of an object submerged in a fluid is greater than at the top of the object. This pressure difference results in a net upwards force on the object. The magnitude of that force exerted is proportional to that pressure difference, and (as explained by [[Archimedes' principle]]) is equivalent to the weight of the fluid that would otherwise occupy the volume of the object, i.e. the [[Displacement (fluid)|displaced]] fluid.

*'''[[Cabin pressurization]]''' — is a process in which conditioned air is pumped into the [[aircraft cabin|cabin]] of an aircraft or [[spacecraft]], in order to create a safe and comfortable environment for passengers and crew flying at high altitudes. For aircraft, this air is usually [[Bleed air|bled off]] from the [[gas turbine|gas turbine engines]] at the compressor stage, and for spacecraft, it is carried in high-pressure, often [[liquid oxygen|cryogenic]] tanks. The air is cooled, humidified, and mixed with recirculated air if necessary, before it is distributed to the cabin by one or more [[Environmental control system (aircraft)|environmental control systems]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://blogs.howstuffworks.com/2011/04/12/how-airplane-cabin-pressurization-works-keeping-you-comfortable-in-the-death-zone-at-33000-feet/ | title=How Airplane Cabin Pressurization Works | publisher=How Stuff Works | date=April 12, 2011 | accessdate=December 31, 2012 | author=Brain, Marshall | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130115141028/http://blogs.howstuffworks.com/2011/04/12/how-airplane-cabin-pressurization-works-keeping-you-comfortable-in-the-death-zone-at-33000-feet/ | archivedate=January 15, 2013 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The cabin pressure is regulated by the outflow valve.

The '''Goddard Institute for Space Studies''' ('''GISS''')  is a laboratory in the Earth Sciences Division of NASA's [[Goddard Space Flight Center]] and a unit of the [[The Earth Institute|Columbia University Earth Institute]].&lt;ref name=columbia&gt;
{{NASA
|article=Overview
|url=http://www.giss.nasa.gov/}}&lt;/ref&gt; The institute is located at [[Columbia University]] in New York City.

Research at the GISS emphasizes a broad study of Global Change; the natural and anthropogenic changes in our environment that affect the habitability of our planet. These effects may occur on greatly differing time scales, from one-time forcings such as volcanic explosions, to seasonal/annual effects such as [[El Niño]], and on up to the millennia of ice ages.

The institute's research combines analysis of comprehensive global datasets, (derived from surface stations combined with satellite data for SSTs), with global models of atmospheric, land surface, and oceanic processes. Study of past climate change on Earth and of other planetary atmospheres provides an additional tool in assessing our general understanding of the atmosphere and its evolution.&lt;ref name=gsss&gt;{{NASA

GISS was established in May 1961 by [[Robert Jastrow]] to do basic research in space sciences in support of Goddard programs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

But even before it opened, the institute had been referred to in the press as the Goddard Institute for Space Studies.&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; It was separated from the Theoretical Division in July 1962. Its offices were originally located in [[The Interchurch Center]], and the institute moved into Columbia's Armstrong Hall (formerly the Ostend apartments and then the Oxford Residence Hotel) in April 1966.

From 1981 to 2013, GISS was directed by [[James E. Hansen]]. In June 2014, [[Gavin A. Schmidt]] was named the institute's third director.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.giss.nasa.gov/research/news/20140609/ |title=NASA Names Schmidt Director of the Goddard Institute for Space Studies}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History of scientific research ==

In the 1960s, GISS was a frequent center for high-level scientific workshops, including the "History of the Earth’s Crust Symposium" in November 1966 which has been described as the meeting that gave birth to the idea of [[plate tectonics]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://eos.org/features/meeting-gave-birth-idea-global-tectonics| title=Meeting gave birth to the idea of global tectonics}}&lt;/ref&gt; At a GISS workshop in 1967, [[John Archibald Wheeler|John Wheeler]] popularized the term "[[black hole]]" as a short-hand for 'gravitionally completely collapsed star', though the term was not coined there.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.worldwidewords.org/topicalwords/tw-bla1.htm|title=World Wide Words: Black Hole|website=World Wide Words|accessdate=14 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In September 1974, at a seminal meeting led by [[Patrick Thaddeus]] at GISS with [[John C. Mather|John Mather]] (his then post-doc) and others discussions began on the possibility of building a satellite to measure both the spectrum and possible spatial fluctuations of the Cosmic Microwave Background. This led directly to the [[Cosmic Background Explorer|COBE]] satellite project and a [[Nobel Prize]] for Mather.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.nature.com/articles/s41550-017-0170 | title=Patrick Thaddeus}} Nature Astronomy 1, 2017, doi:10.1038/s41550-017-0170&lt;/ref&gt;

== Climate change research ==
A key objective of Goddard Institute for Space Studies research is prediction of climate change in the 21st century. The research combines paleogeological record, analysis of comprehensive global datasets (derived mainly from spacecraft observations), with global models of atmospheric, land surface, and oceanic processes.

Climate science predictions are based substantially on historical analysis of Earth's paleoclimate (climate through geological ages), and the sea-level/ temperature/ carbon dioxide record.

Changes in carbon dioxide associated with continental drift, and the decrease in volcanism as India arrived at the Asian continent, allowed temperatures to drop &amp; Antarctic ice-sheets to form. This resulted in a 75m drop in sea level, allowing our present-day coastlines &amp; habitats to form and stabilize.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.franklin-live.net/site/20110512DrJamesHansen.php|title=James Hansen, public lecture 12th May 2011|publisher=|accessdate=14 January 2018|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110515102527/http://www.franklin-live.net/site/20110512DrJamesHansen.php|archivedate=15 May 2011|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Global change studies at GISS are coordinated with research at other groups within the Earth Sciences Division, including the Laboratory for Atmospheres, Laboratory for Hydrospheric and Biospheric Sciences, and Earth Observing System science office.

== Awards ==
In November 2004, Climatologists [[Drew Shindell]] and [[Gavin Schmidt]] of NASA's Goddard Institute for Space Studies, New York, received [[Scientific American]] magazine's Top 50 Scientist award.&lt;ref&gt;Goddard Institute for Space Studies (November 9, 2004).

The '''Hans Kilian and Lotte Köhler Center''' for Cultural Psychology and Historical Anthropology (KKC) was established in August 2014 at the Chair for Social Theory and Social Psychology, [[Ruhr-University Bochum]], Germany. It is mainly funded by the ''Köhler Foundation'', which is a member of the ''Stifterverband'', a German business community initiative advocating long-term improvement of the German education and research landscape. The KKC is named after two individuals whose biographies are closely linked, namely, Hans Kilian and Lotte Köhler.

[[:de: Hans Kilian|Hans Kilian]] (1921-2008), M.D., held the Chair for Social Psychology and Applied Psychoanalysis at the University of Kassel, Germany, from 1971 to 1984. His research interests included psychosomatic medicine, work psychology, cultural-evolutionary anthropology, and the interdisciplinary analysis of psychohistorical and psychosocial developments in individuals and their social environments. One of his specific interests was the lasting psychological effect of the Nazi system on post-war Germany.

[[:de: Lotte Köhler|Lotte Köhler]] (*1925), M.D., received her psychoanalytic training in Munich, Germany, and Zurich, Switzerland. As a scientist, she is known for her work on self psychology, early-childhood memory development, and attachment theory. As a businesswoman, she chaired the supervisory board and the shareholders’ meeting at Goebel, LLC, located in Darmstadt, Germany. She ended her business career in 1987 when she established the Köhler Foundation, which supports the advancement of the human sciences.

From the 1960s until Hans Kilian’s death, they shared a bond in both the private and scientific domain. As for the latter, they were decisive in introducing [[Heinz Kohut]]’s self psychology to Germany in the 1970s.

Following Hans Kilian’s and Lotte Köhler’s aim to advance psychological and psychoanalytical research through interdisciplinary efforts, the KKC invites input from scholars of manifold fields. In this regard, sociology, anthropology, history, education, and philosophy are considered as important as work in research fields like critical psychology, cultural and postcolonial studies, gender studies, and religious studies.

== Scientific Activities ==
The KKC resulted from a development that began when the [[Hans-Kilian-Award]] was given for the first time in 2011. Since then, its activities have increased and focus on the following areas:
* [[Hans-Kilian-Award]]
* Hans Kilian Lecture Series
* Hans Kilian symposia and workshops
* Hans Kilian fellowships
* Hans Kilian student program
* Collected Works of Hans Kilian
* Kilian-Köhler-Archive

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6224">[[Sigmund Freud]] noticed that [[humor]], like dreams, can be related to unconscious content.&lt;ref name = Freud2&gt;Freud, S. (1928). Humor. ''[[International Journal of Psychoanalysis]], 9,'' 1-6&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1905 book ''[[Jokes and Their Relation to the Unconscious]]'' ({{lang-de|Der Witz und seine Beziehung zum Unbewußten}}), as well as in the 1928 journal article ''Humor'', Freud distinguished contentious jokes&lt;ref name = Matte7&gt;Matte, G. (2001). A psychoanalytical perspective of humor. ''Humor: International Journal of Humor Research, 14''(3),223-241&lt;/ref&gt; from non-contentious or silly humor.  In fact, he sorted humor into three categories that could be translated as: [[joke]], [[comic]], and [[mimetic]].&lt;ref name =Freud3&gt;Freud, S. (1960). ''Jokes and their relation to the unconscious'' (J. Strachey, Trans.). New York: W. W. Norton. (Original work published 1905)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Freud's theory of humor==
In Freud's view, jokes (the verbal and interpersonal form of humor) happened when the [[conscious]] allowed the expression of thoughts that society usually suppressed or forbade.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | title= Masculinity and Ridicule| first1= Timothy | last1= Laurie | first2= Anna | last2= Hickey-Moody | journal=Gender: Laughter |publisher=Macmillan Reference|location=Farmington Hills, MI| pages= 215–228 | year= 2017 | url=https://www.academia.edu/31232852/Masculinity_and_Ridicule}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The [[superego]] allowed the [[Id, ego and super-ego#Ego|ego]] to generate [[humor]].&lt;ref name = Freud2/&gt;  A benevolent [[superego]] allowed a light and comforting type of humor, while a harsh superego created a biting and sarcastic type of humor.&lt;ref name =Freud3/&gt;  A very harsh superego suppressed humor altogether.&lt;ref name = Matte7/&gt;&lt;ref name =Freud3/&gt;  [[Freud]]’s humor theory, like most of his ideas, was based on a dynamic among [[id, ego, and super-ego]].&lt;ref name = Matte7/&gt;  The commanding superego would impede the ego from seeking pleasure for the id, or to momentarily adapt itself to the demands of reality,&lt;ref name = Matte7/&gt; a mature coping method.  Moreover, Freud (1960)&lt;ref name =Freud3/&gt; followed [[Herbert Spencer]]'s ideas of energy being conserved, bottled up, and then released like so much steam venting to avoid an explosion.  Freud was imagining psychic or emotional energy, and this idea is now thought of as the relief theory of laughter.

Later, Freud re-turned his attention to humor noting that not everyone is capable of formulating humor.&lt;ref name =Freud3/&gt;&lt;ref name = Newirth8&gt;Newirth, J. (2006). Jokes and their relation to the unconscious: humor as a fundamental emotional experience. ''Psychoanalytic dialogues'', '''16'''(5), 557–571&lt;/ref&gt;

==The different types of humor==
If [[jokes]] let out forbidden thoughts and feelings that the conscious mind usually suppresses in deference to society,&lt;ref name = Freud2/&gt;&lt;ref name =Freud3/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Smuts, A. (2006). ''Humor.'' In The internet encyclopedia of philosophy. http://www.iep.utm.edu/h/humor.htm#H3, retrieved from the web on 12 April 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; there was an interaction between unconscious drives and conscious thoughts.

[[Mimesis]], on the other hand, was a process involving two different representations of the body in our mind.&lt;ref name = Freud2/&gt;&lt;ref name = Matte7/&gt;&lt;ref name =Freud3/&gt; For example, in the phrase “Their hearts are in the right place,” the heart has two representations.  One is, of course, anatomical while the other is a metaphorical reference to caring and meaning well.

===Tendentious jokes===
Tendentious jokes are jokes that have to contain lust, hostility or both.

===Non-tendentious jokes===

The [[comic]] meant applying “to one and the same act of ideation, two different ideational methods” (Freud, 1905, 300; as cited in Matte, G. (2001)&lt;ref name = Matte7/&gt;). [[William Shakespeare]]’s [[Falstaff]] would be an example of Freud's "comic," generating laughter by expressing previously repressed inhibition.&lt;ref name = Kincaid4&gt;Kincaid, J. R. (2001). ''Falstaff as an example for Freud’s “comic.”'' http://www.victorianweb.org/authors/dickens/kincaid2, retrieved from the web on the 12 May 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; An upset American says at Sunday School: "[[Franklin D. Roosevelt|Roosevelt]] is my Shepherd; I am in want. He makes me to lie down on park benches; he leads me in the paths of destruction for His party's sake".&lt;ref&gt;Martin J. (2006) ''Studies in American humor'', University of Southern California, http://www.compedit.com/introduction.htm, retrieved from the web 17 May 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

== In advertising ==
An analysis of content from [[business-to-business]] advertising magazines in the United States, United Kingdom, and Germany found a high (23 percent) overall usage of humor. The highest percentage was found in the British sample at 26 percent.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=McCullough|first=Lynette S.|last2=Taylor|first2=Ronald K.|date=1993|title=Humor in American, British, and German Ads|url=|journal=Industrial Marketing Management|volume=22|pages=17-28|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Of the types of humor found by McCullough and Taylor,&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; three categories correspond with Freud’s grouping of tendentious (aggression and sexual) and non-tendentious (nonsense) wit. 20 percent of the humor are accounted for as “aggression” and “sexual.” “Nonsense” is listed at 18 percent.

==Criticism==
It has been claimed that Freud's division is artificial and not very clear.&lt;ref name = Newirth8/&gt;&lt;ref name =Altman1&gt;Altman, N. (2006). And now for something completely different: Humor in psychoanalysis. ''Psychoanalytic Dialogues'', '''16'''(5), 573–577.&lt;/ref&gt;  According to Altman (2006),&lt;ref name =Altman1/&gt; these divisions are more semantic than functional.  Hence, all three types of humor may be the result of the dynamic of the [[conscious]] and [[Unconscious mind|unconscious]].&lt;ref name = Newirth8/&gt;&lt;ref name =Altman1/&gt; For example, hate and anger can be hidden by a false sense of love and compassion, which could be the opposite of what was meant, and which could formulate a joke.&lt;ref name = Matte7/&gt;&lt;ref name =Freud3/&gt;&lt;ref name =Altman1/&gt;

{{Nihongo|'''Hyozo Omori'''|大森 兵蔵|Ōmori Hyōzō|March 14, 1876 – January 3, 1913}} was a Japanese physical education specialist who studied in America and married the American artist [[Annie Shepley Omori|Annie Barrows Shepley]]. In Japan, they established ''Yurin En'' (House of the Friendly Neighbor), which was a settlement house and leader in the Japanese playground movement. Omori introduced basketball and volleyball to the country and was the team manager at the [[1912 Summer Olympics|1912 Stockholm Olympics]] in Sweden.

==Education==
Hyozo Omori was in the 1905 class of [[Stanford University]]{{r|Stanford}} and then continued his studies in Springfield, Massachusetts as a YMCA exchange student.{{r|Basketball}} He graduated from YMCA's College in Springfield{{r|Japan at Olympics}} with honors in 1907.{{r|Am Gym}}

==Marriage and career==
In October 1907, Omori married artist [[Annie Shepley Omori|Annie Barrows Shepley]].{{r|ws}} In 1908, when he had returned to Japan, he introduced volleyball and basketball to the country{{r|Basketball}}{{r|Japan at Olympics}} and became known as the "Father of Japanese Basketball".{{r|Better late}} In Tokyo, the Omoris established a [[settlement movement|settlement house]], ''Yurin En'' (House of the Friendly Neighbor) which offered dramatic classes and a playground for children. It also offered courses in sewing, flower arranging, cooking, and crafts as well as mother's meetings and opportunities for people to speak English.{{r|Jordan}}{{r|Survey}} Initially, they met resistance because of their co-educational programs, the fact that the Omoris were Christian, and that they broke down well-establish class barriers.{{r|Jordan}} The ''Yurin En'' was at the forefront of the Japanese playground movement.{{r|Japan at Olympics}}{{r|NRA}}

In 1909, Omori was the Physical Director for the Japanese Association. That year, he wrote "A Brief Survey of the Present Conditions of Physical Education in Japan" for ''Hygiene and Physical Education''.{{r|Hastings}}

Hyozo Omori was a physical education specialist and team manager for the Japanese team that competed in the [[1912 Summer Olympics|1912 Stockholm Olympics]] in Sweden. [[Yahiko Mishima]] from Tokyo Imperial University (now University of Tokyo) ran short distances and [[Shizo Kanakuri]], a 20-year-old Tokyo Higher Normal School student ran the marathon. Judo master [[Kanō Jigorō]] was the leader of the team. It was the first time that Japanese runners competed in the Olympics. Omori became quite ill when the group arrived in Stockholm following the [[Trans-Siberian Railway]] trip.{{r|Better late}}

Hyozo Omori died in 1913, and Annie continued running ''Yurin En'' after his death.{{r|Jordan}}{{r|NRA}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2800">The '''International Committee for the History of Technology''' (ICOHTEC) was founded at a meeting of the International Congress on the History of Science, Technology, and Medicine&lt;ref&gt;http://www.histnet.cnrs.fr/research/sfhst/spip.php?article222&lt;/ref&gt; in Paris in the summer of 1968. Its founding was the brainchild of [[Melvin Kranzberg]], Professor of the History of Technology at [[Case Western Reserve University]] in Cleveland, Ohio, in the United States. Kranzberg had already established the [[Society for the History of Technology]] (SHOT) and its journal, ''[[Technology and Culture]]'', but he felt that in the midst of Cold War tensions, there was a need for another forum that focused on crossing the artificial borders of the Iron Curtain. For Kranzberg, the History of Technology, a new discipline not yet burdened with ideological or political freight as were other branches of history, was an ideal arena where scholars from East and West could find common ground. Kranzberg was supported in this effort by Maurice Daumas from France, Eugene Olszewski from Poland, and S.J. Schuchardine from the USSR, among others. For the past several decades, ICOHTEC's principal activity has been an ''annual meeting'',&lt;ref&gt;http://www.icohtec.org/annual-meeting-current.html&lt;/ref&gt;  where scholars from many countries and from many disclipines gather and share their work. Papers presented at the meetings are usually published in the Committee's annual journal ''ICON''.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.icohtec.org/publications-icon.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

Kranzberg’s vision was largely fulfilled in the meetings that followed, although exchanges among scholars were not always harmonious.  Since the fall of the Berlin Wall in 1989 and the breakup of the Soviet Union in the years that followed, ICOHTEC lost its original reason for being. But it has thrived in the following years and continues to have an active international membership and hold well-attended and intellectually lively meetings. One reason is the perception that its sister society, SHOT, remains somewhat biased toward U.S. membership in spite of efforts to reach out more to an international audience.
&lt;!-- 


ICOHTEC had a very successful meeting [http://www.conferences.hu/ichs09/index.htm] in Budapest, Hungary in 2009. 

In 2010 it held a joint meeting in Tampere, Finland with [[The International Committee for the Conservation of the Industrial Heritage]] (TICCIH) and The International Association of the Labour Museums (WORKLAB), around the theme ‘Reusing the Industrial Past’.

'''Interoperability''' is a characteristic of a product or system, whose interfaces are completely understood, to work with other products or systems, at present or in the future, in either implementation or access, without any restrictions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |others=Copyright AFUL under CC BY-SA |url=http://interoperability-definition.info/en/ |title=Definition of Interoperability |website=dedicated website for a Definition of Interoperability at interoperability-definition.info}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While the term was initially defined for [[information technology]] or [[systems engineering]] services to allow for information exchange,&lt;ref&gt;Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers. IEEE Standard Computer Dictionary: A Compilation of IEEE Standard Computer Glossaries. New York, NY: 1990.&lt;/ref&gt; a broader definition takes into account social, political, and organizational factors that impact system to system performance.&lt;ref&gt;Slater, T. [http://www.ncoic.org/what-is-interoperability "What is Interoperability?"], [http://www.ncoic.org/ ''Network Centric Operations Industry Consortium - NCOIC''], 2012&lt;/ref&gt; Task of building coherent services for users when the individual components are technically different and managed by different organizations&lt;ref&gt;Willium y Arms 2000(afifa iqbal)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Types of interoperability==
If two or more systems are capable of communicating with each other, they exhibit ''syntactic interoperability'' when using specified [[File format|data format]]s and [[communication protocol]]s. [[XML]] or [[SQL]] standards are among the tools of syntactic interoperability.  This is also true for lower-level data formats, such as ensuring alphabetical characters are stored in a same [[encoding|variation]] of [[ASCII]] or a [[Unicode]] format (for English or international text) in all the communicating systems.

Beyond the ability of two or more computer systems to exchange information, [[semantic interoperability]] is the ability to automatically interpret the information exchanged meaningfully and accurately in order to produce useful results as defined by the end users of both systems. To achieve semantic interoperability, both sides must refer to a common information exchange reference model. The content of the information exchange requests are unambiguously defined: what is sent is the same as what is understood. The possibility of promoting this result by user-driven convergence of disparate interpretations of the same information has been object of study by research prototypes such as [[S3DB]].

[[Cross-domain interoperability]] involves multiple social, organizational, political, legal entities working together for a common interest and/or information exchange.&lt;ref&gt;Slater, T. [https://www.ncoic.org/cross-domain-interoperability  "Cross-Domain Interoperability"], [https://www.ncoic.org/home ''Network Centric Operations Industry Consortium - NCOIC''], 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

==Interoperability and open standards==

Interoperability imply Open standards ''[[ab-initio]],'' i.e. by definition. Interoperability imply exchanges between a range of products, or similar products from several different vendors, or even between past and future revisions of the same product. Interoperability may be developed ''[[wikt:ex post facto|post-facto]]'', as a special measure between two products, while excluding the rest, by using Open standards. When a vendor is forced to adapt its system to a dominant system that is not based on Open standards, it is not interoperability but only [[Computer compatibility|compatibility]].

===Open standards===
{{Main article|Open standard}}
Open standards rely on a broadly consultative and inclusive group including representatives from vendors, academics and others holding a stake in the development that discusses and debates the technical and economic merits, demerits and feasibility of a proposed common protocol. After the doubts and reservations of all members are addressed, the resulting common document is endorsed as a ''common standard.''  This document is subsequently released to the public, and henceforth becomes an ''open standard.''  It is usually published and is available freely or at a nominal cost to any and all comers, with ''no further encumbrances.''  Various vendors and individuals (even those who were not part of the original group) can use the standards document to make products that implement the common protocol defined in the standard, and are thus '''interoperable by design,''' with no specific liability or advantage for any customer for choosing one product over another on the basis of standardised features.  The vendors' products compete on the quality of their implementation, user interface, ease of use, performance, price, and a host of other factors, while keeping the customers data intact and transferable even if he chooses to switch to another competing product for business reasons.

===''Post facto'' interoperability===
{{Original research|section|date=August 2016}}''Post facto'' interoperability may be the result of the absolute market dominance of a particular product in contravention of any applicable standards, or if any effective standards were not present at the time of that product's introduction.  The vendor behind that product can then choose to ''ignore'' any forthcoming standards and not co-operate in any standardisation process at all, using its near-monopoly to insist that its product sets the ''de facto'' standard by its very market dominance.  This is not a problem if the product's implementation is open ''and'' minimally encumbered, but it may as well be both closed and heavily encumbered (e.g. by patent claims). Because of the [[network effect]], achieving interoperability with such a product is both critical for any other vendor if it wishes to remain relevant in the market, and difficult to accomplish because of lack of co-operation on equal terms with the original vendor, who may well see the new vendor as a potential competitor and threat.  The newer implementations often rely on [[clean-room reverse engineering]] in the absence of technical data to achieve interoperability.  The original vendors can provide such technical data to others, often in the name of 'encouraging competition,' but such data is invariably encumbered, and may be of limited use.  Availability of such data is ''not'' equivalent to an open standard, because:
# The data is provided by the original vendor on a discretionary basis, who has every interest in blocking the effective implementation of competing solutions, and may subtly alter or change its product, often in newer revisions, so that competitors' implementations are almost, but not quite completely interoperable, leading customers to consider them unreliable or of a lower quality.  These changes can either not be passed on to other vendors at all, or passed on after a strategic delay, maintaining the market dominance of the original vendor.
# The data itself may be encumbered, e.g. by patents or pricing, leading to a dependence of all competing solutions on the original vendor, and possibly leading a revenue stream from the competitors' customers back to the original vendor.  This revenue stream is only a result of the original product's market dominance and not a result of any innate superiority.
# Even when the original vendor is genuinely interested in promoting a healthy competition (so that he may also benefit from the resulting innovative market), post-facto interoperability may often be undesirable as many defects or quirks can be directly traced back to the original implementation's technical limitations.  Although in an open process, anyone may identify and correct such limitations, and the resulting cleaner specification may be used by all vendors, this is more difficult post-facto, as customers already have valuable information and processes encoded in the faulty but dominant product, and other vendors are forced to replicate those faults and quirks even if they could design better solutions, for the sake of preserving interoperability. Alternatively, it can be argued that even open processes are subject to the weight of past implementations and imperfect past designs, and that the power of the dominant vendor to unilaterally correct or improve the system and impose the changes to all users facilitates innovation.
# Lack of an open standard can also become problematic for the customers, as in case of the original vendor's inability to fix a certain problem that is an artifact of technical limitations in the original product. The customer wants that fault fixed, but the vendor has to maintain that faulty state, even across newer revisions of the same product, because that behaviour is a de facto standard and many more customers would have to pay the price of any break in interoperability caused by fixing the original problem and introducing new behaviour.

== Telecommunications ==
In [[telecommunication]], the term can be defined as:

#The ability to provide services to and accept services from other systems, and to use the services exchanged to enable them to operate effectively together. [[ITU-T]] provides standards for international telecommunications. 
#The condition achieved among [[communications-electronics]] systems or items of communications-electronics equipment when [[information]] or services can be exchanged directly and satisfactorily between them and/or their users. The degree of interoperability should be defined when referring to specific cases.&lt;ref&gt;{{FS1037C MS188}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{DODDIC}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[two-way radio]], interoperability is composed of three dimensions:

* compatible communications paths (compatible frequencies, equipment and signaling),
* radio system coverage or adequate signal strength, and;
* scalable capacity.

==Search==
Search interoperability refers to the ability of two or more information collections to be searched by a single query.

Specifically related to web-based search, the challenge of interoperability stems from the fact designers of web resources typically have little or no need to concern themselves with exchanging information with other web resources. [[Federated Search]] technology, which does not place format requirements on the data owner, has emerged as one solution to search interoperability challenges.  In addition, standards, such as [[OAI-PMH]], [[Resource Description Framework|RDF]], and [[SPARQL]], have emerged recently that also help address the issue of search interoperability related to web resources.  Such standards also address broader topics of interoperability, such as allowing data mining.

==Software==
[[Image:Interoperable software.png|250px|thumb|Interoperability: playing the two role network game, when one of the player clients (top left) runs under [[Sun Microsystems]] and another under [[GNU Classpath]] with [[JamVM]]. The applications execute the same [[bytecode]] and interoperate using the standard [[RMI-IIOP]] messages for communication]]
{{Main|Language interoperability}}

With respect to [[software]], the term ''interoperability'' is used to describe the capability of different programs to exchange data via a common set of exchange formats, to read and write the same [[file format]]s, and to use the same [[protocol (computing)|protocol]]s. (The ability to execute the same [[executable|binary code]] on different [[Central processing unit|processor]] platforms is 'not' contemplated by the definition of interoperability.) The lack of interoperability can be a consequence of a lack of attention to [[standardization]] during the design of a program. Indeed, interoperability is not taken for granted in the non-standards-based portion of the computing world.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Official Guide to the SSCP Book|last=Gordon and Hernandez|first=|publisher=SYBEX|year=|isbn=978-1119278634|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[ISO/IEC 2382]]-01, ''Information Technology Vocabulary, Fundamental Terms'', interoperability is defined as follows: "The capability to communicate, execute programs, or transfer data among various functional units in a manner that requires the user to have little or no knowledge of the unique characteristics of those units".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://jtc1sc36.org/doc/36N0646.pdf|title=Proposed Draft Technical Report for: ISO/IEC xxxxx, Information technology -- Learning, education, and training -- Management and delivery -- Specification and use of extensions and profiles|author=SC36 Secretariat|first=|date=2003-11-13|website=|publisher=ISO/IEC JTC1 SC36|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071129034634/http://old.jtc1sc36.org/doc/36N0646.pdf|archive-date=2007-11-29|dead-url=yes|accessdate=12 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Note that the definition is somewhat ambiguous because the ''user'' of a program can be another program and, if the latter is a portion of the set of program that is required to be interoperable, it might well be that it does need to have knowledge of the characteristics of other units.

This definition focuses on the technical side of interoperability, while it has also been pointed out{{By whom|date=August 2016}} that interoperability is often more of an organizational issue: often interoperability has a significant impact on the organizations concerned, raising issues of ownership (do people want to share their data?) or are they dealing with [[information silo]]s, labor relations (are people prepared to undergo training?) and usability. In this context, a more apt definition is captured in the term ''[[business process interoperability]]''.

Interoperability can have important [[economic]] consequences; for example, research has estimated the cost of inadequate interoperability in the U.S. capital facilities industry to be $15.8 billion a year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite report|author1=MP Gallaher |author2=AC O’Connor |author3=JL Dettbarn, Jr. |author4=LT Gilday |date=August 2004|title=Cost Analysis of Inadequate Interoperability in the U.S. Capital Facilities Industry|url=http://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/gcr/2004/NIST.GCR.04-867.pdf|publisher=National Institute of Standards and Technology|page=iv|accessdate=2012-04-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; If competitors' products are not interoperable (due to causes such as [[patent]]s, [[trade secret]]s or [[Coordination failure (economics)|coordination failures]]), the result may well be [[monopoly]] or [[market failure]]. For this reason, it may be prudent for user communities or governments to take steps to encourage interoperability in various situations. At least 30 international bodies and countries have implemented [[eGovernment]]-based interoperability framework initiatives called [[e-GIF]] while in the United States there is the [[NIEM]] initiative.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://lists.oasis-open.org/archives/tgf/201101/pdf00010.pdf |title=e-Government Interoperability A comparative analysis of 30 countries |publisher=CS Transform |year=2010 |accessdate=21 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Standards Defining Organizations (SDOs) provide open public software specifications to facilitate interoperability; examples include the [[Oasis-Open]] organization and [[buildingSMART]] (formerly the International Alliance for Interoperability). As far as user communities, [[Neutral Third Party]] is creating standards for business process interoperability.  Another example of a neutral party is the [[Request for Comments|RFC]] documents from the [[Internet Engineering Task Force]] (IETF).

The OSLC&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://open-services.net/|title=Open Services for Lifecycle Collaboration|author=|date=|publisher=|accessdate=12 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; (Open Service for Lifecycle Collaboration) community is working on finding a common standard in order that software tools can share and exchange data e.g. bugs, tasks, requirements etc. The final goal is to agree on an open standard for interoperability of open source [[Application Lifecycle Management|ALM]] tools.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.slideshare.net/olberger/presentation-icssea2011|title=OSLC (Open Services for Lifecycle Collaboration): open standard for i…|author=|date=30 November 2011|publisher=|accessdate=12 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Java is a great example of an interoperable programming language that allows for programs to be written once and run anywhere with a Java Virtual Machine.&lt;ref&gt;[[Write once, run anywhere]]&lt;/ref&gt;{{better source needed|date=May 2018}} One writing a program in Java, so long as it does not use system specific functionality, will maintain interoperability with all machines that have a Java Virtual Machine. There are many implementations of the Java Virtual Machine, such as Oracle, IBM, Android, etc... If a Java Virtual Machine is created to specification, applications will maintain compatibility because while the implementation is different, the underlying language interfaces are the same.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.safaribooksonline.com/library/view/clojure-programming/9781449310387/ch09.html|title=9. Java and JVM Interoperability [Book]|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Organizations dedicated to interoperability==
Many organizations are dedicated to interoperability. All have in common that they want to push the development of the World Wide Web towards the semantic web.{{dubious|date=March 2014}} Some concentrate on eGovernment, eBusiness or data exchange in general. Internationally, [[Network Centric Operations Industry Consortium]] facilitates global interoperability across borders, language and technical barriers. In Europe, for instance, the European Commission and its [[IDABC]] programme issue the [[European Interoperability Framework]]. IDABC was succeeded by the [[eGovernment in Europe#Interoperability Solutions for European Public Administrations (ISA)|ISA]] programme. They also initiated the [[Semantic Interoperability Centre Europe]] (SEMIC.EU). A [https://web.archive.org/web/20080331053219/http://www.eulis.org/index.html European Land Information Service] (EULIS) was established in 2006, as a consortium of European National Land Registers. The aim of the service is to establish a single portal through which customers are provided with access to information about individual properties, about land and property registration services, and about the associated legal environment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eulis.org/aims.html|title=Welcome - EULIS|first=Erskine|last=Design|date=|publisher=|accessdate=12 August 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160917042036/http://eulis.org/aims.html|archive-date=17 September 2016|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the United States, the government's CORE.gov service provides a collaboration environment for component development, sharing, registration, and reuse and related to this is the [http://www.NIEM.gov National Information Exchange Model (NIEM)] work and component repository. The [[National Institute of Standards and Technology]] serves as an agency for measurement standards.

==Medical industry==
New technology is being introduced in [[hospitals]] and labs at an ever-increasing rate.  The need for “[[plug-and-play]]” interoperability&amp;nbsp;– the ability to take a medical device out of its box and easily make it work with one’s other devices&amp;nbsp;– has attracted great attention from both healthcare providers and industry.

Increasingly, medical devices like incubators, imaging (MRI, CT, ultrasound, and others) are driven by sophisticated software which must integrate at the point of care and with electronic systems, such as electronic medical records. At the 2016 Regulatory Affairs Professionals Society (RAPS) meeting, experts in the field like Angela N. Johnson with GE Healthcare and representative of the United States Food and Drug Administration provided practical seminars in how companies developing new medical devices, and hospitals installing them, can work more effectively to align interoperable software systems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.assurx.com/raps-preview-fda-cdrh-director-shuren-talks-priorities/ |title= RAPS Preview: FDA CDRH Director Shuren Talks Priorities |date= September 19, 2016 |accessdate= April 8, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The HIMSS&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.himss.org/|title=HIMSS|author=|date=|publisher=|accessdate=12 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; board approved the following definition of interoperability on April 5, 2013:

"In healthcare, interoperability is the ability of different information technology systems and software applications to communicate, exchange data, and use the information that has been exchanged. Data exchange schema and standards should permit data to be shared across clinicians, lab, hospital, pharmacy, and patient regardless of the application or application vendor. Interoperability means the ability of health information systems to work together within and across organizational boundaries in order to advance the effective delivery of healthcare for individuals and communities. There are three levels of health information technology interoperability: 1) Foundational; 2) Structural; and 3) Semantic."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.himss.org/library/interoperability-standards/what-is?|title=What is Interoperability?|author=|date=9 March 2016|publisher=|accessdate=12 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

They also have introduced ConCert at HIMSS15,&lt;ref&gt;[http://s3.amazonaws.com/rdcms-himss/files/production/public/2013InnovationCenter/FileDownloads/Toolkit/ConCert_WhitePaper_BORDER_FINAL.pdf ConCert]&lt;/ref&gt; a comprehensive interoperability testing (IOT) and certification program.

==eGovernment==
Speaking from an e-government perspective, interoperability refers to the collaboration ability of cross-border services for citizens, businesses and public administrations. Exchanging data can be a challenge due to language barriers, different specifications of formats and varieties of categorisations. Many more hindrances can be identified.

If data is interpreted differently, collaboration is limited, takes longer and is not efficient. For instance if a citizen of country A wants to purchase land in country B, the person will be asked to submit the proper address data. Address data in both countries include: Full name details, street name and number as well as a post code. The order of the address details might vary. In the same language it is not an obstacle to order the provided address data; but across language barriers it becomes more and more difficult. If the language requires other characters it is almost impossible, if no translation tools are available.

Hence eGovernment applications need to exchange data in a semantically interoperable manner. This saves time and money and reduces sources of errors. Fields of practical use are found in every policy area, be it justice, trade or participation etc. Clear concepts of interpretation patterns are required.

==Public safety==
Interoperability is an important issue for [[police|law enforcement]], [[fire fighting]], [[Emergency medical services|EMS]], and other public health and safety departments, because first responders need to be able to communicate during wide-scale emergencies. It has been a major area of investment and research over the last 12 years.&lt;ref&gt;Allen, D. K., Karanasios, S., &amp; Norman, A. (2013). Information sharing and interoperability: the case of major incident management. European Journal of Information Systems, 10.1057/ejis.2013.8.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Baldini, G. (2010). Report of the workshop on “Interoperable communications for Safety and Security”. Ispra: European Commission, Joint Research Centre (JRC), Institute for the Protection and Security of the Citizen.&lt;/ref&gt; Traditionally, agencies could not exchange information because they operated widely disparate hardware that was incompatible.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.firerescue1.com/fire-products/communications/interoperability/articles/424190-Interoperability-system-bridges-communications-gap/|title=Interoperability system bridges communications gap|newspaper=FireRescue1|access-date=2017-01-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; Agencies' information systems such as computer-aided dispatch systems (CAD) and records management systems (RMS) functioned largely in isolation, so-called "information islands." Agencies tried to bridge this isolation with inefficient, stop-gap methods while large agencies began implementing limited interoperable systems. These approaches were inadequate and, in the U.S.A., the lack of interoperability in the public safety realm become evident during the [[9/11 attacks]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Grier|first=Robin|title=Interoperability Solutions|url=http://www.catcomtec.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=19&amp;Itemid=34|work=Interoperability|publisher=Catalyst Communications|accessdate=28 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; on the Pentagon and World Trade Center structures. Further evidence of a lack of interoperability surfaced when agencies tackled the aftermath of the Hurricane Katrina disaster.

In contrast to the overall national picture, some states, including Utah, have already made great strides forward. The [[Utah Highway Patrol]] and other departments in Utah have created a statewide data-sharing network using technology from a company based in [[Bountiful, Utah]], [http://www.fatpot.com FATPOT Technologies].

The Commonwealth of Virginia is one of the leading states in the United States in improving interoperability and is continually recognized as a National Best Practice by Department of Homeland Security (DHS).{{Citation needed|date=August 2016}} Virginia's proven practitioner-driven governance structure ensures that all the right players are involved in decision making, training and exercises, and planning efforts.{{Citation needed|date=August 2016}}  The Interoperability Coordinator leverages a regional structure to better allocate grant funding around the Commonwealth so that all areas have an opportunity to improve communications interoperability.  Virginia's strategic plan for communications is updated yearly to include new initiatives for the Commonwealth&amp;nbsp;– all projects and efforts are tied to this plan, which is aligned with the National Emergency Communications Plan, authored by Department of Homeland Security's Office of Emergency Communications (OEC).

The State of Washington&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.governor.wa.gov|title=Governor Jay Inslee - Washington State|author=|date=|publisher=|accessdate=12 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; seeks to enhance interoperability statewide. The State Interoperability Executive Committee&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.siec.wa.gov|title=SIEC|author=|date=|publisher=|accessdate=12 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; (SIEC), established by the legislature in 2003, works to assist emergency responder agencies (police, fire, sheriff, medical, hazmat, etc.) at all levels of government (city, county, state, tribal, federal) to define interoperability for their local region.

Washington recognizes collaborating on system design and development for wireless radio systems enables emergency responder agencies to efficiently provide additional services, increase interoperability, and reduce long-term costs.

This work saves the lives of emergency personnel and the citizens they serve.

The U.S. government is making an effort to overcome the nation's lack of public safety interoperability. The Department of Homeland Security's [[Office for Interoperability and Compatibility]] (OIC) is pursuing the SAFECOM&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.safecomprogram.gov/|title=SAFECOM - Homeland Security|author=|date=|publisher=|accessdate=12 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[CADIP]] and [[Project 25]] programs, which are designed to help agencies as they integrate their CAD and other IT systems.

The OIC launched CADIP in August 2007. This project will partner the OIC with agencies in several locations, including [[Silicon Valley]]. This program will use case studies to identify the best practices and challenges associated with linking CAD systems across jurisdictional boundaries. These lessons will create the tools and resources public safety agencies can use to build interoperable CAD systems and communicate across local, state, and federal boundaries.

==Military forces==
''Force interoperability'' is defined in NATO as the ability of the forces of two or more nations to train, exercise and operate effectively together in the execution of assigned missions and tasks. Additionally NATO defines interoperability more generally as the ability to act together coherently, effectively and efficiently to achieve Allied tactical, operational and strategic objectives.&lt;ref&gt;[http://nso.nato.int/nso/zPublic/ap/aap6/AAP-6.pdf NATO Glossary of Terms and Definitions, NATO AAP-06]{{dead link|date=April 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the strategic level, interoperability is an enabler for coalition building. It facilitates meaningful contributions by coalition partners. At this level, interoperability issues center on harmonizing the world views, strategies, doctrines, and force structures. Interoperability is an element of coalition willingness to work together over the long term to achieve and maintain shared interests against common threats. Interoperability at the operational and tactical levels is where strategic/political interoperability and technological interoperability come together to help allies shape the environment, manage crises, and win wars. The benefits of interoperability at the operational and tactical levels generally derive from the fungibility or interchangeability of force elements and units. "Technological interoperability" reflects the interfaces between organizations and systems. It focuses on communications and computers but also involves the technical capabilities of systems and the resulting mission compatibility or incompatibility between the systems and data of coalition partners. At the technological level, the benefits of interoperability come primarily from their impacts at the operational and tactical levels in terms of enhancing fungibility and flexibility.&lt;ref&gt;Interoperability: A continuing Challenge in Coalition Air Operations - Chapter 2 “A broad Definition of Interoperability”, by Myron Hura, Gary McLeod, James Schneider and others, RAND Monograph Report, 2000, [http://www.rand.org/content/dam/rand/pubs/monograph_reports/MR1235/MR1235.chap2.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Achieving software interoperability==
Software interoperability is achieved through five interrelated ways:
# Product testing
#: Products produced to a common standard, or to a sub-profile thereof, depend on clarity of the standards, but there may be discrepancies in their implementations that system or unit testing may not uncover. This requires that systems formally be tested in a production scenario&amp;nbsp;– as they will be finally implemented&amp;nbsp;– to ensure they actually will intercommunicate as advertised, i.e. they are interoperable. Interoperable product testing is different from conformance-based product testing as conformance to a standard does not necessarily engender interoperability with another product which is also tested for conformance.
# Product engineering
#: Implements the common standard, or a sub-profile thereof, as defined by the industry/community partnerships with the specific intention of achieving interoperability with other software implementations also following the same standard or sub-profile thereof.
# Industry/community partnership
#: Industry-community partnerships, either domestic or international, sponsor standard workgroups with the purpose to define a common standard that may be used to allow software systems to intercommunicate for a defined purpose. At times an industry/community will sub-profile an existing standard produced by another organization to reduce options and thus making interoperability more achievable for implementations.
# Common technology and IP
#: The use of a common technology or IP may speed up and reduce complexity of interoperability by reducing variability between components from different sets of separately developed software products and thus allowing them to intercommunicate more readily. This technique has some of the same technical results as using a common vendor product to produce interoperability. The common technology can come through 3rd party libraries or open source developments.
# Standard implementation
#: Software interoperability requires a common agreement that is normally arrived at via an industrial, national or international [[standardisation|standard]].

Each of these has an important role in reducing variability in intercommunication software and enhancing a common understanding of the end goal to be achieved.

==Interoperability as a question of power and market dominance==
Interoperability tends to be regarded as an issue for experts and its implications for daily living are sometimes underrated. The [[European Union Microsoft competition case]] shows how interoperability concerns important questions of power relationships. In 2004, the European Commission found that Microsoft had abused its market power by deliberately restricting interoperability between Windows work group servers and non-Microsoft work group servers. By doing so, Microsoft was able to protect its dominant market position for work group server operating systems, the heart of corporate IT networks. Microsoft was ordered to disclose complete and accurate interface documentation, which will enable rival vendors to compete on an equal footing (“the interoperability remedy”). As of June 2005 the Commission is market testing a new proposal by Microsoft to do this, having rejected previous proposals as insufficient.

Interoperability has also surfaced in the [[software patent debate]] in the [[European Parliament]] (June–July 2005). Critics claim that because patents on techniques required for interoperability are kept under RAND (reasonable and non discriminatory licensing) conditions, customers will have to pay license fees twice: once for the product and, in the appropriate case, once for the patent protected programme the product uses.

== Railways ==
{{anchor| Railways}}
Railways have greater or lesser interoperability depending on conforming to standards of [[Track gauge|gauge]], [[Railway coupling|couplings]], [[brake (railway)|brakes]], [[Railway signal|signalling]], [[communications]], [[loading gauge]], [[structure gauge]], and [[Railway signalling#Operating rules|operating rules]], to mention a few parameters.  For passenger rail service, different [[railway platform height]] and [[platform gap|width clearance]] standards may also cause interoperability problems.

North American freight railroads are highly interoperable, but systems in Europe, Asia, Africa, Central and South America, and Australia are much less so.  The parameter most difficult to overcome (at reasonable cost) is incompatibility of gauge, though [[variable gauge]] axle systems are increasingly used.

}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the context of a [[trial]], a [[Hearing (law)|hearing]], [[Discovery (law)|discovery]], or other kinds of [[legal proceedings]], the resolution of certain [[Question of fact|questions of fact]] or [[question of law|law]] may hinge on the application of one or more legal tests.

Legal tests are often formulated from the logical analysis of a judicial decision or a court order where it appears that a [[finder of fact]] or the [[court]] made a particular decision after contemplating a well-defined set of circumstances. It is assumed that evaluating any given set of circumstances under a legal test will lead to an unambiguous and repeatable result. &lt;!-- this needs to be clarified --&gt;

==Subclavian artery==
The branches of the [[subclavian artery]] can be remembered using '''VIT'''amin '''C''' and '''D'''.

==Posterior mediastinum==
The contents of [[posterior mediastinum]] can be remembered using the [[mnemonic]],  "'''DATES'''"
*'''D'''escending aorta
*'''A'''zygous vein and hemiazygos vein
*'''T'''horacic duct
*'''E'''sophagus
*'''S'''ympathetic trunk/ganglia.&lt;ref name="LH-PM"&gt;{{Cite web| url = http://www.lifehugger.com/moc/900/Posterior_mediastinum_Contents | title =Posterior mediastinum: Contents | publisher = LifeHugger | accessdate = |date = 27 September 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Superior orbital fissure==
''&lt;u&gt;S&lt;/u&gt;tanding &lt;u&gt;r&lt;/u&gt;oom &lt;u&gt;o&lt;/u&gt;nly'' can be used to remember that:
*V&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; passes through the &lt;u&gt;s&lt;/u&gt;uperior orbital fissure
*V&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; through the foramen &lt;u&gt;r&lt;/u&gt;otundum
*V&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; through the foramen &lt;u&gt;o&lt;/u&gt;vale.&lt;ref&gt;{{MedicalMnemonics|38|||}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Foramen magnum==
Contents of the [[foramen magnum]]: VAMPS-ATM
*Vertebral arteries
*Anterior Spinal artery
*Meningeal branches of the cervical nerves
*Posterior spinal arteries
*Spinal part of the accessory nerve
*Alar and Apical ligaments of the dense
*Tectorial membrane
*Medulla oblongata{{cit|date=January 2015}}

==Cerebellum==
[[Deep cerebellar nuclei]] and their positions relative to the midline: "Fat Guys Eat Donuts," where each letter indicates the medial to lateral location in the cerebellar white matter
*[[nucleus fastigii]]
*[[globose nucleus]]
*[[nucleus emboliformis]]
*[[dentate nucleus]]{{cit|date=February 2015}}

==Pes anserinus==
A mnemonic to remember the muscles that contribute tendons to the [[Pes anserinus (leg)|pes anserinus]] and the innervations of these muscles is SGT FOT (sergeant FOT)
*S- '''S'''artorius 
*G- '''G'''racilis 
*T- semi'''T'''endinosus  (from anterior to posterior). 
*F- [[femoral nerve]] 
*O- [[obturator nerve]] 
*T- tibial division of the [[sciatic nerve]]. 
Notice the order of the muscles (S, G, T) follows the order of the innervating nerves which correspond to those muscles (F, O, T){{cit|date=February 2015}}

==Femoral triangle==
The [[femoral triangle]] is shaped like the sail of a sailing ship and hence its boundaries can be remembered using the mnemonic, "'''SAIL'''":
*'''S'''artorius
*'''A'''dductor longus
*'''I'''nguinal '''L'''igament.&lt;ref name="LHC"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://mc.lifehugger.com/moc/389/femoral-triangle-boundaries | title = Medical mnemonics | publisher = LifeHugger | accessdate = 2009-12-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The order of structures in the femoral triangle is important in the embalming of bodies, as the femoral artery is often exposed and used to pump embalming fluids into the body. The order of this neurovascular bundle can be remembered using the mnemonic, "'''NAVY'''":
*'''N'''erve
*'''A'''rtery
*'''V'''ein
*[[briefs#History|'''Y''' -fronts]] (the British term of a style of men's underwear with a "Y" shaped front that acts as a fly). The "Y" is midline (corresponding with the penis) and the mnemonic always reads from lateral to medial (in other words, the [[Femoral Nerve]] is always lateral). 

An alternate to this mnemonic is "'''NAVEL'''" for '''N'''erve, '''A'''rtery, '''V'''ein, '''E'''mpty Space and '''L'''ymph, to include the [[deep inguinal lymph nodes]] located medial to the [[Femoral vein]].{{cit|date=February 2015}}

==Popliteal fossa==
A useful '''mnemonic''' to remember [[popliteal fossa]] anatomy (medial-to-lateral arrangement) is: '''S'''erve '''A'''nd '''V'''olley '''N'''ext '''B'''all. 
*'''S: '''semimembranosus and semitendinosus (superior medial border) 
*'''A: '''artery (popliteal artery) 
*'''V: '''vein (popliteal vein) 
*'''N: '''nerve (tibial nerve) 
*'''B: '''biceps femoris  (superior lateral border).  The lateral and medial heads of gastrocnemius form the inferior border.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://radiopaedia.org/articles/popliteal-fossa-anatomy-mnemonic|title=Popliteal fossa anatomy (mnemonic) {{!}} Radiology Reference Article {{!}} Radiopaedia.org|last=Niknejad|first=Mohammad Taghi|website=radiopaedia.org|language=en|access-date=2017-07-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cranial nerves==
There are many mnemonics for the names of the [[cranial nerve]]s, e.g.
* "OOOTTAFAGVSH" is "OLd OPen OCeans TROuble TRIbesmen ABout Fish VEnom Giving VArious ACute/SPlitting Headaches" (a mnemonic that gives enough letters to distinguish between nerves that start with the same letter), or "On old Olympus's towering tops, a Finn and German viewed some hops,"&lt;ref&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The differences between these depend on "acoustic" versus "vestibulocochlear" and "spinal-accessory" versus "accessory".

* A common example mnemonic for remembering which nerves are motor (M), sensory (S), or both (B), "'''S'''ome '''S'''ay '''M'''arry '''M'''oney '''B'''ut '''M'''y '''B'''rother '''S'''ays '''B'''enevolent '''B'''ride '''M'''atters '''M'''ore". There are a very large number of additional mnemonics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Saladin | first = Kenneth S. | title = Human anatomy |edition=2nd |publisher = McGraw-Hill Higher Education | year = 2008 | isbn = 0-07-110209-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Diaphragm apertures: spinal levels==
Many mnemonics are used for diaphragm apertures including:
===Number of letters===
*'''Aortic hiatus''' = '''12''' letters = T'''12'''
*'''Oesophagus''' = '''10''' letters = T'''10'''
*'''Vena cava''' = '''8''' letters = T'''8'''&lt;ref name=mm/&gt;&lt;sup&gt;p.&amp;nbsp;1&lt;/sup&gt;
===I ate 10 eggs at 12===
*I = IVC 
*ate = T8
*10 = T10
*Eggs = Esophagus
*At = Aorta
*12 = T12
{{clarify span|"I Read Very Old And Torn Articles" - IVC, Right phrenic nerve, Vagus, Oesophagus, Aorta, Thoracic duct, Azygous vein.|date=September 2018}}
===(V)oice (O)f (A)merica===
*V- vena cava -T8 
*O-oesophagus-T10
*A-aorta-T12

==Duodenum: lengths of parts==
"Counting 1 to 4 but staggered":&lt;ref name=mm/&gt;&lt;sup&gt;p.&amp;nbsp;1&lt;/sup&gt;
*'''1'''st part: '''2''' inches
*'''2'''nd part: '''3''' inches

*'''4'''th part: '''1''' inch

==Endocrine glands==
The major glands of the [[endocrine]] system, excluding ovaries and testes: "'''T-A-P'''." (T2, A3, P4)
*'''T'''hymus
*'''T'''hyroid
*'''A'''nterior pituitary
*'''A'''drenal cortex
*'''A'''drenal medulla
*'''P'''osterior pituitary
*'''P'''arathyroid gland
*'''P'''ancreas
*'''P'''ineal&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.austincc.edu/sziser/Biol%202404/2404%20handouts/The%20Endocrine%20System.pdf | title=The Endocrine System (Major Endocrine Glands) | accessdate=21 April 2015 | author=Ziser | pages=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Extraocular muscles==
A good mnemonic to remember which muscles are innervated by what nerve is to paraphrase it as a molecular equation: LR&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;SO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;R&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.medicalmnemonics.com/cgi-bin/lookup.cfm?id1=572|work= Medicalmnemonics.com|title=Extraocular muscles cranial nerve innervation|first=Atul |last=Sing|date=August 22, 2000|accessdate=20 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
* '''L'''ateral '''R'''ectus - Cranial Nerve '''VI'''
* '''S'''uperior '''O'''blique - Cranial Nerve '''IV'''
* the '''R'''est of the muscles - Cranial Nerve '''III'''

Another way to remember which nerves innervate which muscles is to understand the meaning behind all the Latin words.
* The ''fourth cranial nerve'', the trochlear, is so named because the muscle it innervates, the superior oblique, runs through a little fascial pulley that changes its direction of pull (the [[trochlea of superior oblique]]). This pulley exists in the superiomedial corner of each orbit, and "trochl-" is Latin for "pulley."
* The ''sixth cranial nerve'', the ''abducens'', is so named because it controls the lateral rectus, which abducts the eye (rotates it laterally) upon contraction.
* The ''third cranial nerve'', the ''oculomotor'', is so named because it is in charge of the movement (motor) of the eye (oculo-). It controls all the other muscles.

==G.I. tract layers (simplified)==
===M.S.M.S===
*'''M'''ucosa
*'''S'''ubmucosa
*'''M'''uscularis propria

==Kidney functions==
===A WET BED===
*'''A''' – maintaining ACID-base balance
*'''W''' – maintaining WATER balance
*'''E''' – ELECTROLYTE balance
*'''T''' – TOXIN removal
*'''B''' – BLOOD Pressure control
*'''E''' – making ERYTHROPOIETIN
*'''D''' – Vitamin D metabolism

==Lateral geniculate nucleus==
A simple mnemonic for remembering {{clarify span|this|date=September 2018}} is "See I? I see, I see," with "see" representing the C in "contralateral," and "I" representing the I in "ipsilateral." Another is "Emily and Pete meet eye to eye" as in "M and P meet I to I," or again, Magno and Parvo meet Ipsi to Ipsi.

Another way of remembering {{clarify span|this|date=September 2018}} is 2+3=5, which is correct, so ipsilateral side, and 1+4 doesn't equal 6, so contralateral.

[[Image:Two Giraffes.PNG|thumb|[[Giraffes]] in [[Kenya]]; giraffes have been called "especially [[homosexual behavior in animals|gay]]" for often engaging in male-male sexual behavior more than male-female ([[heterosexual]]) [[sex]].&lt;ref name="You Are Being Lied to: The"&gt;Kick (2001)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Imaginova (2007f)&lt;/ref&gt;]]
For these mammals, there is documented evidence of [[homosexual behavior in animals|homosexual behavior]] of one or more of the following kinds: [[Animal sexual behavior|sexual behavior]], [[courtship]], [[affection]], [[pair bond]]ing, or [[parenting]].

[[Bruce Bagemihl]] writes that the presence of [[same-sex sexual behavior]] was not officially observed on a large scale until the 1990s due to possible [[Observer-expectancy effect|observer bias]] caused by social attitudes towards [[LGBT]] people making homosexuality in animals a [[taboo]] subject.&lt;ref name="Two Hundred Years"&gt;Bagemihl (1999)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="1,500 Animal Species Practice"&gt;News-medical.net (2006)&lt;/ref&gt; He devotes three chapters; ''Two Hundred Years at Looking at Homosexual Wildlife'', ''Explaining (Away) Animal Homosexuality,'' and ''Not For Breeding Only'' in his 1999 book ''Biological Exuberance'' to the "documentation of systematic [[prejudice]]s" where he notes "the ''present ignorance'' of [[biology]] lies precisely in its single-minded attempt to find reproductive (or other) "explanations" for homosexuality, transgender, and [[procreate|non-procreative]] and alternative [[heterosexual]]ities.&lt;ref name="Not For Breeding Only"&gt;Bagemihl (1999) page 213&lt;/ref&gt; Petter Bøckman, academic adviser for the ''[[Against Nature?]]'' exhibit stated "[M]any researchers have described homosexuality as something altogether different from sex. They must realise that animals can have sex with who they will, when they will and without consideration to a researcher's [[Ethics (philosophy)|ethical]] [[principle]]s". Homosexual behavior is  found amongst social [[bird]]s and [[mammal]]s, particularly the sea mammals and the [[primates]].&lt;ref name="1,500 Animal Species Practice"/&gt;

Animal sexual behavior takes many different forms, even within the same [[species]] and the motivations for and implications of their behaviors have yet to be fully understood. Bagemihl's research shows that homosexual behavior, not necessarily sexual activity, has been documented in about 500 species as of 1999, ranging from [[primates]] to [[Acanthocephala|gut worms]].&lt;ref name="Two Hundred Years"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Biological Exuberance: Animal"&gt;Harrold (1999)&lt;/ref&gt; Homosexuality in animals is controversial with some [[Social conservatism|social conservatives]] because it asserts the naturalness of homosexuality in humans, while others counter that it has no implications and is nonsensical to equate animal behavior to [[morality]].&lt;ref name="The Animal Homosexuality Myth"&gt;Solimeo (2004)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Defending A Higher Law"&gt;Solimeo (2004b)&lt;/ref&gt;  On the other hand, social liberals and many gay people believe homosexuality is natural, and therefore find the existence of homosexual sex in animals unsurprising.  Animal preference and motivation is always inferred from behavior. Thus homosexual behavior has been given a number of terms over the years. The correct usage of the term ''homosexual'' is that an animal ''exhibits homosexual behavior'', however this article conforms to the usage by modern research&lt;ref&gt;Bagemihl (1999) pages 122-166&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Roughgarden (2004) pp.13-183&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Vasey (1995) pages 173-204&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Sommer &amp; Vasey (2006)&lt;/ref&gt; applying the term ''homosexuality'' to all sexual behavior ([[Copulation (zoology)|copulation]], [[genitals|genital]] stimulation, [[mating|mating games]] and sexual [[Display (zoology)|display behavior]]) between animals of the same sex.

This a list of some [[mammals]] that had been recorded engaging in homosexual behavior, which is part of a larger [[list of animals displaying homosexual behavior]] including [[birds]], [[insects]], [[fish]] etc.

'''Mike Cooley''' (born 1934) is an Irish-born engineer and former trade union leader, best known for his work on the social effects of technology and in particular 'Socially Useful Production' and 'Human Centred Systems'. He is also know for his involvement in workplace activism at the British company [[Lucas Industries plc|Lucas Aerospace]] in the late 1970s. In 1981, he was a recipient of the [[Right Livelihood Award]] &lt;ref&gt; https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=tjolDwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA55&amp;dq=right+livelihood+award+cooley&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwi6uq7u9rDeAhULGCwKHVSNCvkQ6AEILDAB#v=onepage&amp;q=right%20livelihood%20award%20cooley&amp;f=false &lt;/ref&gt;.  Cooley was born in [[Tuam]], Ireland, and attended the Christian Brothers school and was classmates with [[Tom Murphy (playwright)]] and the trade unionist Mick Brennan. He was an apprentice at the Tuam Sugar Factory and later studied engineering in Germany, Switzerland and England.  He has held several leadership positions in the field of [[computer-aided design]].

== [[The Lucas Plan]]: 1970's ==

Towards the end of the 1970s, Mike Cooley was a designer at Lucas Aerospace, and chaired the local branch of the technical trade union [[Technical, Administrative and Supervisory Section|TASS]]. He was one of the militant activists behind [[The Lucas Plan]],&lt;ref&gt;The Lucas Plan by Hilary Wainwright Schocken Books (1981) {{ISBN|978-0-8052-8098-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://libcom.org/history/1976-the-fight-for-useful-work-at-lucas-aerospace |title=1976: The fight for useful work at Lucas Aerospace |publisher=libcom.org |date=13 September 2006 |accessdate=16 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; a radical strategy to avoid workforce layoffs by converting production at Lucas from armaments to civilian products &lt;ref&gt;https://www.techworld.com/tech-innovation/plan-when-engineers-proposed-socially-useful-goods-over-weapons-3685280/ | The Plan: when engineers proposed socially useful goods over weapons &lt;/ref&gt;.

The vision of [[The Lucas Plan | the plan]] was to replace weapons manufacture with the development of socially useful goods, like [[solar heating]] equipment, [[artificial kidney]]s, and systems for [[Intermodal passenger transport|intermodal transportation]] &lt;ref&gt; https://www.theguardian.com/film/2018/oct/14/lucas-aerospace-1970s-plan-documentary-eco-pioneers | Eco-pioneers in the 1970s: how aerospace workers tried to save their jobs – and the planet &lt;/ref&gt;.  The goal was to not simply retain jobs, but to design the work so that the workers would be motivated by the social value of their activities.  The proposals of the alternative plan were not accepted by Lucas management, and Cooley was dismissed in 1981,&lt;ref name=smith&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Smith |first1=Adrian  |year=2014|title=Socially Useful Production |url=http://steps-centre.org/wp-content/uploads/Socially-Useful-Production.pdf|page=17|series=STEPS Working Papers |location=Brighton |publisher=[[STEPS Centre]]|volume=58 |access-date=15 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; allegedly because of excessive time spent upon union business &lt;ref&gt; https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=OFj21rLPJf0C&amp;pg=PA878&amp;lpg=PA878&amp;dq=lucas+plan+cooley&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=4R1UbTtepv&amp;sig=FvL7lCR_09_JToUUjzSXOW5OUfE&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=2ahUKEwj5saOf9bDeAhXFFiwKHSGnCBo4FBDoATAAegQIBxAB#v=onepage&amp;q=lucas%20plan%20cooley&amp;f=false &lt;/ref&gt; or "concerns of society as a whole".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rightlivelihood.org/cooley.html|title=The Right Livelihood Award website|accessdate=16 October 2013|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131002044243/http://www.rightlivelihood.org/cooley.html|archivedate=2 October 2013|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following his sacking by Lucas he was appointed Technology Director of the [[Greater London Council | GLC]] and later founded &lt;ref&gt; https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2000/apr/06/londonmayor.uk&lt;/ref&gt; the Greater London Enterprise Board (GLEB).&lt;ref name=smith /&gt;

==''Architect or Bee: 1980''==

In 1980, Cooley published a critique of the automation and computerisation of engineering work under the title ''[[Architect or Bee?]] The human/technology relationship''.  The title alludes to a comparison made by [[Karl Marx]], on the issue of the creative achievements of human imaginative power.&lt;ref&gt;cf Karl Marx, ''[[Capital, Volume I]]&lt;/ref&gt;, On the Sanctity of Work: 'A bee puts to shame many an architect in the construction of its cells; but what distinguishes the worst of architects from the best of bees is namely this. The architect will construct in his imagination that which he will ultimately erect in reality. At the end of every labour process, we get that which existed in the consciousness of the labourer at its commencement.'

Mike Cooley's pioneering work on human-centred systems and socially useful production was compiled and first published by Shirley Cooley, Mike's wife, in 1980 (Hand &amp; Brain publications); the second edition was published in the USA in 1982 by [[South End Press]] with an introduction from MIT Professor [[David F. Noble | David Noble]] and was followed by a new edition published by [[Hogarth Press]] in 1987 with an introduction by [[Anthony Barnett (writer) | Anthony Barnett]]. The current edition was published by [[Spokesman Books]] in 2016 and has an introduction by [[Frances O’Grady]] the General Secretary of the TUC &lt;ref&gt; http://www.spokesmanbooks.com/Spokesman/PDF/131OGrady.pdf | Architect or Bee? The human price of technology &lt;/ref&gt;. The book has been translated into five languages with the sixth, Chinese, in the pipeline. 

Since departing from Lucas, Cooley has been active as an advisor on numerous public and private sector projects. He is a founding member and president of the International Institute of Human Centred Systems.  He has published over 100 scientific papers as well as fifteen books, and has been a guest lecturer at universities in Europe, Australia, the US and Japan &lt;ref&gt; https://dblp.org/pers/hd/c/Cooley:Mike | DBLP Computer Science Bibliograghy &lt;/ref&gt;.

== Socially Useful Production ==

In 'The Shape of Future Technology' &lt;ref&gt; The Shape of Future Technology: The Anthropocentric Alternative (Paperback), edited by Peter Brödner; Published by Springer-Verlag Berlin and Heidelberg GmbH &amp; Co. KG, Germany (1990) ISBN 10: 3540195769 ISBN 13: 9783540195764  &lt;/ref&gt; Mike Cooley asserts: "One of the most remarkable features of modern industrial society, is the gap between that which technology could provide for society (its potential) and that which it actually does provide for society (its reality). We have for example, complex control systems which can guide a missile to another continent with extraordinary accuracy, yet the blind and the disabled have to stagger around our cities in very much the same way as they did in mediaeval times."

== The Right Livelihood Award; 1981 ==

Mike Cooley was awarded the [[Right Livelihood Award]] in 1981 for "designing and promoting the theory and practice of human-centred, socially useful production." &lt;ref&gt; https://www.rightlivelihoodaward.org/laureates/mike-cooley/ &lt;/ref&gt; In his acceptance speech, Mike Cooley noted "Science and technology is not given. It was made by people like us. If it's not doing for us what we want, we have a right and a responsibility to change it." &lt;ref&gt; https://www.rightlivelihoodaward.org/speech/acceptance-speech-mike-cooley/ &lt;/ref&gt;

== Human-centred systems == 

In ''Architect or Bee?'', Cooley coined the term "human-centred systems" in the context of the transition in his profession from traditional drafting at a [[drawing board]] to [[computer-aided design]].&lt;ref&gt;Architect or Bee?, Mike Cooley, [[South End Press]], 1982&lt;/ref&gt; Human-centred systems&lt;ref&gt; https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-1-4471-1717-9_10  &lt;/ref&gt;, as used in economics, computing and design, aim to preserve or enhance human skills, in both manual and office work, in environments in which technology tends to undermine the skills that people use in their work.&lt;ref&gt;Labor and Monoply Capital. The Degradation of Work in the 20th Century, John Bellamy Foster and Harry Braverman, Monthly Review Press, 1998&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Programmers and Managers: The Routinization of Computer Programmers in the United States, Philip Kraft, 1977&lt;/ref&gt;

See in particular; ''Human-centred systems'' by Mike Cooley; Chapter 10; ''Designing Human-centred Technology: A Cross-disciplinary Project in Computer-aided Manufacturing''; Springer-Verlag London 1989; Editor: Howard Rosenbrock; {{ISBN|978-3-540-19567-2}}

== Greater London Enterprise Board (GLEB): 1982 ==

[[Ken Livingstone]] and Mike Cooley &lt;ref&gt; https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2000/apr/06/londonmayor.uk  &lt;/ref&gt; founded the Greater London Enterprise Board (GLEB) in 1982, which was an industrial development and job creation agency set up by the [[Greater London Council | GLC]] to create employment by investing in the industrial regeneration of London, with the funds provided by the council, its workers' pension fund and the financial markets. During the first two years of the enterprise board's existence the Greater London council provided a total annual budget of around £30 million, made up of some £20 million section 137 funds and £10 million section 3 mortgage loan facilities.. Frank Dobson in Hansard Noted in 1985 when GLEB can under threat of closure “The Government are not worried because the GLEB has been a failure; they are worried because it has been a success.” &lt;ref&gt;  https://api.parliament.uk/historic-hansard/commons/1985/jul/26/greater-london-enterprise-board &lt;/ref&gt;

== AI &amp; Society (Founding Chairman): 1987 ==
Mike Cooley was also the founding chairman of [[AI &amp; Society]], which is now a major international forum for socially responsible technology. The journal has been running since 1987 and focuses on ‘societal issues including the design, use, management, and policy of information, communications and new media technologies, with a particular emphasis on cultural, social, cognitive, economic, ethical, and philosophical implications’ (Springer, 2018).

== ''Delinquent Genius: The Strange Affair of Man and His Technology : 1992'' ==
Delinquent Genius: The Strange Affair of Man and His Technology by Mike Cooley with a foreword by [[Michael D. Higgins]], President of Ireland explores the relationship between mankind and technology development (technological progress). The book analyses the social impact of technology and the dangers of accepting the "one best" scientific idea of progress. The book was written in 1992 but not published until 2018.

According to [[Michael D. Higgins]], President of Ireland: “Delinquent Genius is simply brimming with insights. It traces the sources of technology and its application. It is, above all else, a brilliant account of a dangerous hubris which can lead to that which is instrumental becoming a source, a dangerous source of domination, of passive rather than active existence... I believe the publication of this book must be seen as an invaluable contribution. What is particularly moving in it is that it takes all of these issues that have been raised in different fora, and in different ways and locates them in a biographical experience of a brilliant scholar. There is something immensely hopeful in this, the sheer power that comes from retaining one’s early curiosity, harvesting it through scholarship, and delivering it for the benefit of mankind.” &lt;ref&gt; https://spokesmanbookshop.com/epages/36621f87-f6e8-411d-b941-d46fe29be74c.sf/en_GB/?ObjectPath=/Shops/36621f87-f6e8-411d-b941-d46fe29be74c/Products/Cooley | Delinquent Genius: The Strange Affair of Man and His Technology by Mike Cooley, foreword by Michael D.

The '''Moby Project''' is a collection of public-domain lexical resources. It was created by [[Grady Ward]]. The resources were dedicated to the public domain, and are now mirrored at [[Project Gutenberg]]. {{As of|2007}}, it contains the largest free phonetic database, with 177,267 words and corresponding pronunciations.{{citation needed|date=September 2016}}

== Hyphenator ==
The '''Moby Hyphenator II''' contains [[Hyphenation algorithm|hyphenations]] of 187,175 words and phrases (including 9,752 entries where no hyphenations are given, such as ''through'' and ''avoir'').  The character encoding appears to be [[Mac OS Roman|MacRoman]], and hyphenation is indicated by a bullet (character value 165 decimal, or A5 hexadecimal).  Some entries, however, have a combination of actual hyphens and character 165, such as "bar•ber-sur•geon".

There is little to no documentation of the hyphenation choices made; the following examples might give some flavour of the style of hyphenation used: at•mos•phere; at•tend•ant; ca•pac•i•ty; un•col•or•a•ble.

== Language ==
'''Moby Language II''' contains wordlists of five languages: [[French language|French]], [[German language|German]], [[Italian language|Italian]], [[Japanese language|Japanese]], and [[Spanish language|Spanish]]:

{| class="wikitable"
|-
! Language
! Words
! Size (in [[byte]]s)
|-
! French
|align="right"| 138,257
|align="right"| 1,524,757
|-
! German
|align="right"| 159,809
|align="right"| 2,055,986
|-

|align="right"| 60,453

|align="right"| 850,523
|-
! Total
|align="right"| 560,101
! 5,928,030
|}

However, some of the lists are contaminated, for example the Japanese list contains English words such as ''abnormal'' and non-words such as ''abcdefgh'' and ''m,./''.  There are also unusual peculiarities in the sorting of these lists, as the French list contains a straight alphabetical listing, while the German list contains the alphabetical listing of traditionally capitalized words and then the alphabetical listing of traditionally lower-cased words.  The list of Italian words, however, contains no capitalized words whatsoever.

The foreign languages list does not use accented characters, so "e^tre" is how a user would look up the French word ''être'' ("To Be").

== Part-of-Speech ==
'''Moby Part-of-Speech''' contains 233,356 words fully described by [[Lexical category|part(s) of speech]], listed in priority order. The format of the file is ''word\parts-of-speech'', with the following parts of speech being identified:

{| class="wikitable"

| I
|-
| [[Nominative]]
| o
|}

== Pronunciator ==
The '''Moby Pronunciator II''' contains 177,267 entries with corresponding pronunciations. Most of the entries describe a single word, but approximately 79,000&lt;ref&gt;Obtained by running the UNIX command ''grep '.*[-_].* .*' mobypron.unc | wc -l'' after converting the line endings and correcting some encoding errors.&lt;/ref&gt; contain hyphenated or multiple word phrases, names, or [[lexemes]]. The Project Gutenberg distribution also contains a copy of the [[cmudict]] v0.3. The file contains lines of the format ''word[/part-of-speech] pronunciation''. Each line is ended with the ASCII [[Carriage Return]] character (CR, '\r', 0x0D, 13 in decimal).

The ''word'' field can include apostrophes (e.g. ''isn't''), hyphens (e.g. ''able-bodied''), and multiple words separated by underscores (e.g. ''monkey_wrench''). Non-English words are generally rendered, as stated in the documentation, without accents or other diacritical marks. However, in 36 entries (e.g. ''São_Miguel''), some non-ASCII accented characters remain, represented using [[Mac OS Roman]] encoding.

The part-of-speech field is used to disambiguate 770 of the words which have differing pronunciations depending on their part-of-speech. For example, for the words spelled ''close,'' the verb has the pronunciation {{IPAc-en|ˈ|k|l|oʊ|z}}, whereas the adjective is {{IPAc-en|ˈ|k|l|oʊ|s}}. The parts-of-speech have been assigned the following codes:

{| class="wikitable"
|-
! Part-of-speech
! Code
|-
| [[Noun]]
| n
|-
| [[Verb]]
| v
|-
| [[Adjective]]
| aj
|-
| [[Adverb]]
| av
|-
| [[Interjection]]
| interj
|}

Following this is the pronunciation. Several special symbols are present:

{| class="wikitable"
|-
! Symbol
! Meaning
|-
| _
| Used to separate words
|-
| '
| [[Primary stress]] on the following syllable
|-
| ,
| [[Secondary stress]] on the following syllable
|}

The rest of the symbols are used to represent [[International Phonetic Alphabet|IPA]] characters. The pronunciations are generally consistent with a [[General American]] dialect of English, that exhibits [[father-bother merger]], [[hurry-furry merger]] and [[lot-cloth split]], but does not exhibit [[cot-caught merger]] or [[wine-whine merger]]. Each phoneme is represented by a sequence of one or more characters. Some of the sequences are delimited with a slash character "/", as shown in the following table, but note that the sequence for {{IPAc-en|ɔɪ}} is delimited by ''two'' slash characters at either end:

To this collection are added a number of extra sequences representing phonemes found in several other languages. These are used to encode the non-English words, phrases and names that are included in the database. The following table contains these extra phonemes, but note that the extent to which some of these may exist due to encoding errors is not clear.

'''''Monatsschrift für die Geschichte und Wissenschaft des Judenthums''''' ("Monthly magazine for science and history of Judaism", abbreviated to '''''MGWJ''''') is a monthly journal devoted to the [[science of Judaism]]. It was founded by [[Zecharias Frankel]] in [[Dresden]] in 1851, following the suppression of ''[[Zeitschrift für die Religiösen Interessen des Judenthums]]'' in 1846.&lt;ref name="jewishenc" /&gt; It was published in [[Germany]] for 83 years between 1851 and 1939&lt;ref name="jvl" /&gt; (except in 1887–1892)&lt;ref name="jewishenc" /&gt;&lt;ref name="jvl" /&gt; In time, it became the leading journal in the Jewish world.&lt;ref name="jvl" /&gt;

Frankel believed that the objects striven for in the contest of 1848 had been attained, and that the Jews no longer had separate political interests. He therefore considered that the time had arrived for them to undertake a scientific investigation of their history and literature.&lt;ref name="jewishenc" /&gt;

The first seventeen volumes of the "''Monatsschrift''" were edited by Frankel, who was succeeded by the historian [[Heinrich Graetz]]. The latter edited vols. xviii. to xxxvi. inclusive, being assisted by Pinkus Frankl of [[Berlin]] in vols. xxxiii. to xxxv. Publication was stopped in 1887, but was resumed in 1892, with Marcus Brann&lt;ref name="jewishencMarcus"/&gt; and [[David Kaufmann]] as joint editors (vols. xxxvii. to xliii.). Upon Kaufmann's death (1899) Brann became sole editor. Since Jan., 1904, the "''Monatsschrift''" has appeared as the organ of the Gesellschaft zur Förderung der Wissenschaft des Judenthums.&lt;ref name="jewishenc" /&gt;

The "''Monatsschrif''" was first published in Dresden. Some volumes were then issued in [[Krotoschin]] and some in Berlin; but the greatest number appeared in [[Breslau]]. A complete table of contents for the first seventeen volumes is appended to vol. xvii., and a similar table for the years 1869 to 1887 is given at the end of vol. xxxvi. This table has been published separately also.&lt;ref name="jewishenc" /&gt;

The '''Moss Landing Marine Laboratories''' (MLML) is a multi-campus marine research consortium of the [[California State University System]], headquartered at [[Moss Landing, California]].

==Organization==
Moss Landing Marine Laboratories is part of the [[California State University]], administered by [[San Jose State University|San Jose State University (SJSU)]], and located in [[Moss Landing, California]].  The main building is located at 8272 Moss Landing Road, {{coord|36.79441|N|121.78762|W| type:landmark_region:US-CA |display=inline,title}}. It was established in 1966.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title= About Us |work= Moss Landing Marine Laboratories official web site |url= http://www.mlml.calstate.edu/about-us |accessdate= December 4, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
At the midpoint of the coast of [[Monterey Bay]], it is only a few hundred meters from [[Monterey Canyon]], the largest [[undersea canyon]] on the west coast of the Americas.  As a result, researchers are able to reach areas with depths greater than 1000 meters in less than an hour by boat from the facility.

The facility is a [[Sea grant colleges|sea grant college]], which offers a [[Master's Degree|Master's of Science]] degree in [[marine sciences]] through the seven universities that make up the consortium, as well as offering graduate and undergraduate marine science courses to the students of the campuses.

The seven members of  the Moss Landing Marine Laboratories consortium are:
*[[California State University, East Bay]]
*[[California State University, Fresno]]
*[[California State University, Monterey Bay]]
*[[California State University, Sacramento]]
*[[San Francisco State University]]
*[[San Jose State University]]
*[[California State University, Stanislaus]]

Researchers at Moss Landing Marine Laboratories also collaborate with scientists at other institutions in analysis of marine chemistry and marine species.  One frequent partner for such collaboration is the [[Marine Mammal Center]].

===Research vessels===
MLML operates two vessels, the {{convert|56|ft|m|adj=on}} R/V ''John H. Martin'', and the {{convert|30|ft|m|adj=on}} R/V ''Sheila B''.

===Sea Grant===
Moss Landing Marine Laboratories participates in the [[Sea Grant Colleges]] program by hosting an office of the UC Sea Grant Extension Program, affiliated with [[University of California, San Diego]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title= A Sea Grant Story |work= Agriculture and Natural Resources – University of California – official web site |url= http://groups.ucanr.org/UCSGEP/ |accessdate= December 4, 2010 |deadurl= yes |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20071020204037/http://groups.ucanr.org/UCSGEP/ |archivedate= October 20, 2007 |df=  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Projects ===
The Submersible Capable of Under Ice Navigation and Imaging was a [[National Science Foundation]] funded research project for robotic under the sea ice for [[Short Baseline Acoustic Positioning System|surveying and exploration in Antarctica]] from 2007 through 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title= Submersible Capable of Under Ice Navigation and Imaging |work= Moss Landing Marine Laboratories official web site |url= http://scini.mlml.calstate.edu/ |accessdate= December 4, 2010 |deadurl= yes |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20101105151324/http://scini.mlml.calstate.edu/ |archivedate= November 5, 2010 |df=  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Vertical Transport and Exchange of Ocean Particulate program (VERTEX) was initiated by Moss Landing Marine Labs in 1981 by Dr. John Martin.&lt;ref&gt;http://earthobservatory.nasa.gov/Features/Martin/martin_4.php&lt;/ref&gt; This project resulted in the development of the "Iron Hypothesis" which stated iron was a limiting factor in ocean water [[phytoplankton]] production and its influence for climate change.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1038/345156a0 |title=Iron in Antarctic waters |year=1990 |last1=Martin |first1=John H. |last2=Gordon |first2=R. Michael |last3=Fitzwater |first3=Steve E. |journal=Nature |volume=345 |issue=6271 |pages=156–8}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dr.Martin was dubbed the nickname "Iron Man" for his role in this discovery.&lt;ref&gt;http://earthobservatory.nasa.gov/Features/Martin/martin.php&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5131">The '''National Atmospheric Release Advisory Center''' (NARAC) is located at the University of California's [[Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory]]. It is a national support and resource center for planning, real-time assessment, emergency response, and detailed studies of incidents involving a wide variety of hazards, including nuclear, radiological, chemical, biological, and natural emissions.

NARAC provides tools and services to federal, state and local governments, that map the probable spread of hazardous material accidentally or intentionally released into the atmosphere.

NARAC provides [[atmospheric dispersion modeling|atmospheric plume predictions]] in time for an emergency manager to decide if protective action is necessary to protect the health and safety of people in affected areas.

== The NARAC facility includes ==

* Scientific and technical staff who provide support and training for NARAC tools, as well as quality assurance and detailed analysis of atmospheric releases.
* 24 hour x 7 day on-duty or on-call staff.
* Training facility.
* An Operations Center with uninterruptible power, backup power generators, and robust computer systems.
* Links to over 100 emergency operations centers on the U.S.
* A team of research and operational staff with expertise in atmospheric research, operational meteorology, numerical modeling, computer science, software engineering, geographical information systems, computer graphics, hazardous material (radiological, chemical, biological) properties and effects.

==The Emergency Response System: Real time dispersion modeling==

The NARAC emergency response central modeling system consists of an integrated suite of [[meteorology|meteorological]] and [[atmospheric dispersion modeling|atmospheric dispersion models]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Turner, D.B.|title=Workbook of atmospheric dispersion estimates: an introduction to dispersion modeling|edition=2nd|publisher=CRC Press|year=1994|isbn=1-56670-023-X}} [http://www.crcpress.com/shopping_cart/products/product_detail.asp?sku=L1023&amp;parent_id=&amp;pc= www.crcpress.com] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071105075907/http://www.crcpress.com/shopping_cart/products/product_detail.asp?sku=L1023&amp;parent_id=&amp;pc= |date=2007-11-05 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Beychok, M.R.|title=[[Fundamentals Of Stack Gas Dispersion]]|edition=4th|publisher=author-published|year=2005|isbn=0-9644588-0-2}} [http://www.air-dispersion.com www.air-dispersion.com]&lt;/ref&gt; The meteorological [[data assimilation]] model, ADAPT, constructs fields of such variables as the mean [[wind]]s, [[pressure]], [[Precipitation (meteorology)|precipitation]], [[temperature]], and [[turbulence]].&lt;ref&gt;Sugiyama, G., and S. T. Chan  (1998), ''A New Meteorological Data Assimilation Model for Real-Time Emergency Response'', 10th Joint Conference on the Applications of Air Pollution Meteorology, Phoenix, Arizona, January, 1998.&lt;/ref&gt;  Non-divergent wind fields are produced by a procedure based on the variational principle and a [[finite element method|finite-element discretization]]. The dispersion model, LODI, solves the 3-D advection-diffusion equation using a [[Air pollution dispersion terminology|Lagrangian]] [[stochastic]], [[Monte Carlo method]].&lt;ref&gt;Ermak, D.L., and J.S. Nasstrom (2000), ''A Lagrangian Stochastic Diffusion Method for Inhomogeneous Turbulence'', Atmospheric Environment, 34, 7, 1059-1068.&lt;/ref&gt;  LODI includes methods for simulating the processes of mean wind advection, turbulent diffusion, radioactive decay and production, bio-agent degradation, first-order chemical reactions, [[Air pollution dispersion terminology|wet deposition]], gravitational settling, [[Air pollution dispersion terminology|dry deposition]], and [[Air pollution dispersion terminology|buoyant]]/momentum plume rise.

The models are coupled to NARAC databases providing topography, geographical data, chemical-biological-nuclear agent properties and health risk levels, real-time meteorological observational data, and global and mesoscale forecast model predictions. The NARAC modeling system also includes an in-house version of the Naval Research Laboratory's mesoscale weather forecast model COAMPS.&lt;ref&gt;Hodur, R. M.

The '''Nautical Archaeology Program''' (NAP) is a degree-granting program within the [https://web.archive.org/web/20080929210141/http://anthropology.tamu.edu/index.htm Anthropology Department] at [[Texas A&amp;M University]] in [[College Station, Texas]].

The Nautical Archaeology Program offers admission to students seeking graduate degrees in [[Maritime archaeology|nautical archaeology]]. The primary focus is on training archaeologists to become divers, rather than teaching divers the principles of anthropology and archaeology.  Students are also required to learn the principles of archaeological conservation, with primary emphasis on the treatment of waterlogged artifacts.

==Academic Program==
The program has six full-time faculty members and many research associates who conduct surveys, excavations, conservation and reconstruction of ancient, medieval, and early modern shipwrecks. Each professor holds an endowed fellowship.  All NAP students are required to take several core courses: History of Wooden Shipbuilding, Research and Reconstruction of Ships, Conservation of Cultural Resources, and Archaeological Methods and Theory.&lt;ref&gt;[http://nautarch.tamu.edu/academic/classes.html NAP Class Information]&lt;/ref&gt; The average time to complete a master's degree is three to five years; for a Ph.D. the average is five to seven years.&lt;ref&gt;Hamilton, Donny L. 2005. ''The Institute of Nautical Archaeology &amp; The Nautical Archaeology Program: A History of Both Institutions, Their Interaction, and Their Role in Student Education''. The INA Quarterly, 32(2) 14-21.&lt;/ref&gt; The program admits between eight and ten students each year. Graduating students are awarded their M.A. or Ph.D. in Anthropology.

==History of the Program==
The Nautical Archaeology Program began after the [[Institute of Nautical Archaeology]] (INA) became affiliated with Texas A&amp;M University in 1976.  As part of the affiliation, Texas A&amp;M established the Nautical Archaeology Program as a separate entity.  Since the first excavations INA carried out were in the Mediterranean, the main focus was initially on Old World nautical archaeology; after affiliating with the University, a New World archaeologist joined the staff, and work began in North America and Africa.&lt;ref&gt;Bass, George F. "Introduction: Reclaiming Lost History from Beneath the Seven Seas" ''In Beneath the Seven Seas: Adventures with the Institute of Nautical Archaeology'', ed. George F. Bass, 10-27. London: Thames &amp; Hudson, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;  The establishment of a department dedicated to the discipline allowed [[nautical archaeology]] to develop into an important subfield of archaeology.

===Creation of Center for Maritime Archaeology and Conservation===
In 2005, the Texas A&amp;M University System Board of Regents established the [[Center for Maritime Archaeology and Conservation]] (CMAC), a research center intended to be the main mechanism of cooperation between the Nautical Archaeology Program and the Institute of Nautical Archaeology. All of the laboratories once part of the Nautical Archaeology Program are now administered by CMAC. CMAC is meant to be the Nautical counterpart of the Center for the Study of the First Americans (CSFA), a highly regarded research institute affiliated with Texas A&amp;M which works closely with the terrestrial archaeologists in the Anthropology department.&lt;ref&gt;Hamilton, D. 2005, 20.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Nautical Archaeology Program Faculty===
The staff of six full-time professors of Nautical Archaeology makes the NAP one of the largest academic programs in nautical archaeology in the world.&lt;ref&gt;Hamilton, D. 2005, 20.&lt;/ref&gt; NAP professors direct most of INA's projects, since the security offered by their permanent positions allows a long-term commitment to excavation and publishing.&lt;ref&gt;Hamilton, D. 2005, 15.&lt;/ref&gt; Each professor holds an endowed fellowship, professorship, or chair&lt;ref&gt;Hamilton, D. 2005, 20.&lt;/ref&gt;

Since the creation of the program, there have been only 11 faculty members: Dr. [[George Bass (archaeologist)|George Bass]], Dr. Frederick van Doornick, Jr., Dr. Fred Hocker, J. Richard Steffy, Dr. Deborah Carlson, Dr. Filipe Vieira de Castro, Dr. Kevin Crisman, Dr. Donny Hamilton, Dr. Cemal Pulak, Dr. C. Wayne Smith, and Dr. Shelley Wachsmann.&lt;ref&gt;Hamilton, D. 2005, 20.&lt;/ref&gt;

Dr. Bass and Dr. van Doornick are now professors emeriti and Dr. Hocker left the program in 1999 after eight years of teaching to take a position with the Center for Maritime Archaeology, part of the [[National Museum of Denmark]] in Roskilde. J. Richard Steffy died from chronic obstructive pulmonary disorder on November 29, 2007.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2007/12/04/us/04steffy.html NY Times Obituary, December 4, 2007]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Nicolas Appert''' is a [[The Netherlands|Dutch]] study association for [[Food Technology]] students at [[Wageningen University]]. The association is named after the [[France|French]] inventor [[Nicolas Appert]], who can be seen as the first food technologist. The chef Nicolas Appert was researching ways to preserve food for a longer period of time and discovered that heating food products in a closed glass jar would greatly increase its shelflife. A process, nowadays called appertisation.

On September 6, 1962, during a foreign study trip, the study association Nicolas Appert was founded. Nowadays the association is still very active, having good relations with food companies and organising a lot of activities for its members.

Examples of these activities are lectures and excursions from and to food companies, but also social activities such as a sporting or drinks with the departments of Food Processing, Food Chemistry, Food Microbiology, Food Physics and Product Design and Quality Management. All these activities are made possible by the participation of a large group of active, enthusiastic students in committees and the board.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5763">'''Nutritionism''' is a [[paradigm]] that assumes that it is the scientifically identified [[nutrients]] in foods that determine the value of individual food stuffs in the [[diet (nutrition)|diet]].&lt;ref name="unhappy" /&gt; In other words, it is the idea that the nutritional value of a food is the sum of all its individual nutrients, vitamins, and other components. Another aspect of the term is the implication that the only point of eating is to promote bodily health. The term is largely pejorative, implying that this way of viewing food is simplistic and harmful, and the term is usually used to label others' views. The concept's most prominent opponent, and popularizer of the term, [[journalist]] [[Michael Pollan]], argues that a food's nutritional value is "more than the sum of its parts."

}}&lt;/ref&gt;  the notion was popularized by Michael Pollan.&lt;ref name="unhappy"&gt;{{cite news

}}&lt;/ref&gt; The key to Pollan's understanding of nutritionism is "the widely shared but unexamined assumption ... that the key to understanding food is indeed the nutrient." Since nutrients are invisible, it is now necessary to rely on nutrition experts to make food choices. Because science has an incomplete understanding of how food affects the human body, Pollan argues, relying solely on information regarding individual nutrients has led people and policy makers to repeatedly make poor decisions relating to nutrition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Pollan blames nutritionism for many of the health problems relating to diet in the [[Western World]] today. He compares Nutritionism to a religion, relying on "priests" (nutritional scientists and journalists) to interpret the latest [[orthodoxy]] for the masses. Like many religions, nutritionism has divided the world into good and evil components, although what is good or evil can change dramatically with time. Pollan believes that nutritionism is inherently flawed due to a [[Reduction (philosophy)|reductive]] bias within science to isolate and study individual factors disconnected from their usual contexts such as diet and culture, factors which have repeatedly been shown to have a fundamental impact on nutritional outcomes. Even when scientists have attempted to study factors such as culture, diet, and long term consumption patterns, the enormous difficulties in making accurate measurements relating to individual nutritional components, and producing meaningful conclusions has resulted in incomplete results at best, and misleading or harmful results at worst.

[[Ben Goldacre]] wrote that nutritionism, or its attribution to scientists, is the "bollocks du jour", and that it is "driven by a set of first year undergraduate errors in interpreting scientific data."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
 | first = Ben | last = Goldacre | date = 2007-01-22 | publisher=New Statesman
 | title=Science and Fiction | pages=16–17 |accessdate=May 19, 2013
 | url=http://www.newstatesman.com/sites/default/files/pdf/ethicalfood07.pdf
}}&lt;/ref&gt; In his opinion, professional researchers and medical experts bear some blame for nutritionism because they at times created unrealistic expectations about the potential benefits of their research, but that the primary promoters of nutritionism are health food manufacturers, self-proclaimed "gurus" and journalists who have an incomplete understanding of science, along with a credulous public that is willing to believe whatever simplistic theories they are told in the mass media.

At least one observer, Daniel Engber has argued that Pollan's anti-nutritionism, or anti-[[food science]] stance has taken on a dogmatic tint itself. He says, "Modern nutrition may be more of an ideology than a science, but so is Pollan's nutritional Darwinism. The two ideologies stand in direct opposition to one another, with the science-minded progressives on one side and the culinary conservatives on the other."&lt;ref name="Enber"&gt;{{cite web

 | url=http://www.slate.com/id/2181149/
}}&lt;/ref&gt; One criticism is that while many scientific studies of nutrition, or the conclusions extrapolated from them by both scientists and journalists have been bad, we should not reject a scientific approach to food altogether. One reviewer notes that the study of [[vitamin]]s and nutrients led to vast improvement in treatment of diseases such as [[beriberi]] or [[scurvy]] and that with further refinement food science may well help combat other diseases and health conditions. The complexity of food science should not be taken as a reason to abandon systematic investigation of it. Daniel Engber also argues that Pollan over idealizes the diet of our ancestors, and believes that it may not be well suited to our modern needs.&lt;ref name="Enber"/&gt;

[[File:Orgelkids Doe-orgel leskist.jpg|thumb|200px|The Do-organ of Orgelkids]]
'''Orgelkids''' (Dutch, "organkids") is an [[education]]al project meant to familiarize and educate children with the [[pipe organ]] musical instrument. The project was initiated in the [[Netherlands]] in 2009 by Lydia Vroegindeweij and is directed towards [[cultural heritage|cultural legacy]] and [[music education]].  Initially the project consisted of a website with educational tips and lesson suggestions to organize, among other projects,  an excursion to a large pipe organ.  Since 2013, Orgelkids has at its disposal a speciallly developed educational organ assembly kit.  A complete, craftsman-built organ, in unassembled component parts, is contained in a lesson box.  The instrument can be assembled and subsequently played.  This so-called Do-organ is rented out by Orgelkids to [[organist]]s, [[organ builder]]s or organ teachers who want to organize educational projects for children.

== Justification / Background ==
The classical pipe organ is almost always built in a fixed location in a building and not very accessible for children.  Due to increased [[secularization]] of society, fewer children attend churches, so they have fewer occasions to spontaneously experience a pipe organ.&lt;ref name=secu&gt;an. 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; Many smaller churches in N. America have electronic organs.  &lt;br /&gt;
In the Netherlands there is a wealth of historical organs.  For the preservation and maintenance of this cultural legacy, it is important to encourage a continuing flow of new organists and organ builders.  To prevent that knowledge and enthusiasm for organs continue to decline, Orgelkids has made a special instrument available to schools.  An [[organist]] or [[organ builder]] visits the school with the Do-organ and supervises the students as they build/assemble the organ.

== Orgelkids Do-organ ==
[[File:2013 Orgelkids Doe-orgel pijpen plaatsen.jpg|thumb|180px|left|Children in primary school are assembling the Do-organ]]
An organ in a lesson box is a unique concept, first conceived and built by Dutch organ builder Wim Janssen specially for the goal of educating children with the technology and playing of the organ.  It is not a demonstration organ with just a few keys, but a real instrument with which children can self-discover how it works.  That is the reason it was given the name, "Do-organ."
The Orgelkids instrument is a mechanical, tracker organ with two [[octave]]s (24 keys) and two [[organ stop|registers]] which can be used independently or in combination. Air (wind in organ parlance)  is supplied by a hand-pumped [[bellows]].&lt;ref name=octaves&gt;Verhoeven 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;

All the materials used are identical to those used in a large pipe organ (such as [[oak wood]] and [[sheepskin|sheep leather]]).  Children experience the value and quality of craftsman-made instruments.

The lesson box is supplied with instruction manuals which include many photos, by which children can assemble the organ with a minimum of instructions, in about 45 minutes.  In addition, there are other lesson materials available such as an [[instructional video]] by the builder, an [[e-book]], and a presentation for a digital [[blackboard]].

Ton Stevens, organist of the basilica of St. John in [[Oosterhout]], the Netherlands, works with kids on [[World Animal Day]] in the basilica every year. First they build and play the Do-organ of Orgelkids, and afterwards the children can take a look at the "real" organ built by [[Maarschalkerweerd]] in 1890. Of course songs like ''[[Old MacDonald Had a Farm]]'' are played on the organ on the occasion of that special day.&lt;ref name=stevens&gt;Rodenburg 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

== International developments ==
Orgelkids started in the [[Netherlands]] in 2013 with a single lesson box.  The home for this organ is in the [[Amersfoort]] region, which is in the center of the country.  In the first year, 1350 children were reached.
In 2015 it was expanded with a second organ which is based in [[Belgium]], operating out of [[Antwerp]].  In its first year there, 800 children were reached.

The project has attracted more international attention.  In Oregon a sister project, Orgelkids USA, an educational 501c3 nonprofit,&lt;ref name="orgelkidsusa.org"&gt;{{cite web|title=Orgelkids USA|url=http://www.orgelkidsusa.org|website=orgelkidsusa.org|accessdate=28 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; was launched in 2016 with the mission to help grow a nationwide network of independent kits. They helped place five organ kits built by the US builders in their first year. Orgelkids USA kits are being commissioned to serve as regional resources by chapters of the [[American Guild of Organists]] as well as by non-profit organizations whose missions are pipe organ related. 
== Training for organ builders ==
Since 2016, Orgelkids has been supporting the training of organ builders and the passing down of artisanal skills.  Organ building shops can have apprentice builders work on an Orgelkids instrument during their practical training.  In doing so they develop all manner of practical skills which are also needed in the building or restoration of large, monumental organs.  After completion, the organ kit can be made available for educational projects.
For those who wish to build an organ kit themselves, building instructions are available including 20 technical drawings that correspond to the original organ.

== Foundation ==
The Orgelkids project has been brought into the Dutch "Stichting Kerk Muziek Netwerk" (Church Music Network Foundation) since 2013.&lt;ref name=SKMN&gt;Van den Broucke en Vroegindeweij 2016, p. 113.&lt;/ref&gt; This non-profit foundation engages to make relevant aspects of church music accessible to the greater public.

== Orgelkids USA ==
US-based Orgelkids USA&lt;ref name="orgelkidsusa.org" /&gt; was founded in June 2015 as a program&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=OrgelKids - USA, Pipe Speak, 1st November 2015, Volume 6 No. 3|url=http://agoeugene.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Nov-2015-Newsletter-Final.pdf|website=Eugene American Guild of Organists|accessdate=28 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; of the Eugene Oregon USA chapter of the American Guild of Organists,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Eugene AGO|url=http://agoeugene.org/|website=Eugene American Guild of Organists|accessdate=28 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and later incorporated on 29 August 2016 as a section-501(c)(3) non-profit organization. Orgelkids USA shares a similar educational and outreach agenda&lt;ref name="orgelkidsusa.org" /&gt; as the original Netherlands-based Orgelkids organization, serving as a pilot program for the US and helping grow a nationwide network of independent organ kits. Orgelkids USA was launched with a generous grant by the New York City American Guild of Organists (AGO) '&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=NYC AGO|url=http://www.nycago.org|website=New York City American Guild of Organists|accessdate=28 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Centennial Millennium Fund,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=OrgelKids USA Update, Pipe Speak, 1st April 2016, Volume 6 No. 8|url=http://agoeugene.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/April-2016-Newsletter-Final.pdf|website=Eugene American Guild of Organists|accessdate=28 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Thank You, New York, from the Eugene, Oregon Chapter of the AGO, Newsletter, May 2016, Vol. 66, No. 8|url=http://www.nycago.org/Newsletter/1605newsletter.html|website=New York City American Guild of Organists|accessdate=28 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; , similar grants from the San Francisco and Seattle chapters of AGO and a social media fundraising campaign.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Two kids with a goal|url=http://www.gazettetimes.com/news/local/two-kids-with-a-goal/article_a8f05189-dc77-5deb-8cb2-d1cd64783831.html|accessdate=28 October 2016|work=Gazette Times|publisher=Mid-Valley Media Group|date=11 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; 2017 was an inaugural year of outreach programing in the USA with two Orgelkids USA kits reaching over 700 people.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.voxhumanajournal.com/scheessele2018|title=A New Organ Outreach: Orgelkids USA|last=Scheessele|first=Erin|date=June 3, 2018|website=Vox Humana|language=en|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-06-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[computer graphics]], '''planar''' is the method of representing [[pixel]] colors with several ''[[bit plane|bitplanes]]'' of [[Random Access Memory|RAM]]. Each bit in a bitplane is related to one pixel on the screen. Unlike [[Packed pixel|chunky]], [[high color]], or [[Color depth#True color (24-bit) | true color]] graphics, the whole dataset for an individual pixel isn't in one specific location in RAM, but spread across the bitplanes that make up the display.

This scheme originated in the early days of computer graphics. The memory [[Integrated circuit|chips]] of this era can not supply data fast enough on their own to generate a picture on a TV screen or monitor from a large [[framebuffer]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

 | last = Rogers
 | title = Procedural Elements for Computer Graphics
 | publisher = McGraw-Hill
 | year = 1985
 | page = 13
 | isbn = 0-07-053534-5 
}}&lt;/ref&gt; By splitting the data up into multiple planes, each plane can be stored on a separate memory chip. These chips can then be read in parallel at a slower rate, allowing graphical display on modest hardware. The [[Enhanced Graphics Adapter|EGA]] video adapter on early [[IBM PC]] computers uses planar arrangement in color graphical modes for this reason. The later [[Video Graphics Array|VGA]] includes [[Mode 13h|one non-planar mode]] which sacrifices memory efficiency for more convenient access.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://wiki.osdev.org/VGA_Hardware|title=VGA Hardware - OSDev Wiki|website=wiki.osdev.org|accessdate=September 4, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Diagram of planar computer graphics.svg|thumb|Combining four one-bit planes into a final "four bits per pixel" (16-color) image]]
For example, on a [[Packed pixel|chunky]] display, each byte represents one pixel. Three pixels in a row are stored as follows, where up to 256 different colors are available:

{|class="wikitable"
! Byte index || 0 || 1 || 2
|-
| Value (binary) || 00000000 || 00000001 || 00000010
|-
| Value (decimal) || 0 || 1 || 2
|-
| Resulting pixel
|style="background-color: #000000; color: white;"| Black
|style="background-color: #0000A8; color: white;"| Blue
|style="background-color: #00A800; color: white;"| Green
|}

Whereas a planar data store could use 2 bitplanes, providing for a 4 color display:

{|class="wikitable"
! Byte index ||colspan=8| 0
|-
! Bit index || 0 || 1 || 2 || 3 || 4 || 5 || 6 || 7

Adding a third plane makes 2&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;=8 colors available. Where fewer than 256 colors are needed, planar graphics are more economical in RAM compared with 8-bit chunky graphics, as there are no unused bits in a given byte.

A disadvantage of planar graphics is that more RAM address cycles are needed for [[scrolling]] and [[animation]]s, although these operations can be made faster by dedicated hardware such as the [[blitter]] chips used in [[Amiga]] and some later [[Atari ST]] computers.{{Citation needed|date=June 2014}}

'''Political methodology''' is a subfield of [[Political science]] that studies the [[quantitative property|quantitative]] methods used to study politics. It combines [[statistics]], [[mathematics]], and [[formal theory (political science)|formal theory]]. Political methodology is often used for [[positive science|positive]] research, in contrast to [[normative]] research. It is similar to [[econometrics]].

== Journals ==

Political methodology is often published in the "top 3" journals ([http://www.apsanet.org/utils/journal.cfm?Journal=APSR&amp;CFID=31778852&amp;CFTOKEN=52017342 American Political Science Review], [http://ajps.org/ American Journal of Political Science], and [http://www.journalofpolitics.org/ Journal of Politics]), in sub-field journals, and in methods-focused journals.

The '''"Power of Women"''' (''Weibermacht'' in German) is a medieval and Renaissance artistic and [[literary topos]], showing "heroic or wise men dominated by women", presenting "an admonitory and often humorous inversion of the male-dominated sexual hierarchy".&lt;ref&gt;Ainsworth, p. 59&lt;/ref&gt;  It was defined by [[Susan L. Smith]] as "the representational practice of bringing together at least two, but usually more, well-known figures from the Bible, ancient history, or romance to exemplify a cluster of interrelated themes that include the wiles of women, the power of love, and the trials of marriage".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Babinsky|first=Elen L.|year=1997|title=Rev. of Smith, ''The Power of Women'' |journal=[[American Society of Church History |Church History]] |volume=66 |issue=2 |pages=340–341 |doi=10.2307/3170688 |url=http://journals.cambridge.org/action/displayAbstract?fromPage=online&amp;aid=2298424}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Smith argues that the topos is not simply a "straightforward manifestation of medieval antifeminism"; rather, it is "a site of contest through which conflicting ideas about gender roles could be expressed".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Smith|first=Susan L.|editor=Margaret Schaus|title=Women and Gender in Medieval Europe: An Encyclopedia |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=aDhOv6hgN2IC&amp;pg=PA845 |year=2006|publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis |isbn=978-0415969444 |pages=844–845}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''c.f.'' Nurse p. 1, who characterises it as arising from the complex religious and social turmoil provoked by the European Reformation of the sixteenth century.&lt;/ref&gt;

Smith argues the topos originates in classical literature&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Millett |first=Bella |date=22 September 1997 |title=Rev. of Smith, ''The Power of Women'' |journal=[[Medium Aevum]] |url=http://www.thefreelibrary.com/The+Power+of+Women%3A+A+%27Topos%27+in+Medieval+Art+and+Literature.-a020331549}}&lt;/ref&gt; and finds it in medieval texts such as ''[[Aucassin et Nicolette]]'', ''[[The Consolation of Philosophy]]'', the ''[[Roman de la Rose]]'', and the ''[[Canterbury Tales]]''.&lt;ref name=Harp208&gt;Harp p. 208&lt;/ref&gt;  The topos was attacked by [[Christine de Pizan]] around 1400, who argued that if women wrote these accounts their interpretations would be different from those of men.&lt;ref name= Wolfthal&gt;Wolfthal p. 57&lt;/ref&gt;

In the visual arts, images are found in various media, mainly from the 14th century onwards, and becoming increasingly popular in the 15th century. By then the frequently recurring subjects include [[Judith beheading Holofernes]], [[The tale of Phyllis and Aristotle|Phyllis riding Aristotle]], [[Samson in popular culture#Art|Samson and Delilah]], [[Salome]] and her mother [[Herodias]], [[Jael]] killing [[Sisera]], [[Bathsheba]] bathing in sight of [[David]], the idolatry of [[Solomon]], [[Virgil in his basket]], as well as many depictions of witches, and genre images of wives dominating their husbands. The last group came to be called the '''battle for the trousers'''.&lt;ref&gt;Salomon, 87; "''strijd om de broek''" in sixteenth century Netherlandish literature and printmaking.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Joseph (patriarch)|Joseph]] and [[Potiphar|Potiphar's wife]] and [[Lot (biblical person)#Lot and his daughters|Lot and his Daughters]] were somewhat late joiners to the group, but increasingly popular later on.&lt;ref&gt;Russell, pp. 147–148, Nos 20–32 (Judith), 87–110, 120–125; Ainsworth, pp. 59–66; Salomon, pp. 87–88; Hall, 41–42&lt;/ref&gt; [[Tomyris]], the [[Scythian]] queen who defeated [[Cyrus the Great]] and abused his corpse, was painted by Rubens and several Italians.&lt;ref&gt;Hall, 305&lt;/ref&gt;

These scenes, mostly shown in consistent compositions involving just two persons and visually distinctive actions, were easily recognisable and seem to have also been represented dramatically in entertainments of various sorts, whether as short scenes or [[tableaux vivants]].&lt;ref&gt;Snyder, 461&lt;/ref&gt;  It is not clear who first coined the term ''Weibermacht'', but it had evidently gained currency in the sixteenth century [[Northern Renaissance]] in Germany and the Low Countries.&lt;ref&gt;Nurse p. 1&lt;/ref&gt;

==Visual arts==

In early images from the Gothic period genre subjects or "classical" ones such as ''Phyllis Riding Aristotle'' and ''Virgil in his Basket'', in fact both medieval legendary accretions, were more popular than the biblical ones predominating later. They often appear on the same pieces as the [[Assault on the Castle of Love]], as on a [[Casket with Scenes of Romances (Walters 71264)|casket in Baltimore]]. This and similar subjects of [[courtly love]] mostly survive on ivory objects for female use, such as caskets or mirror-cases. It shows ladies defending a castle against men, generally unsuccessfully.&lt;ref&gt;[[:File:A woman defends her castle.jpg|But not always]]. More typically the only real resistance is Cupid firing arrows.&lt;/ref&gt; These images are essentially light-hearted romantic fantasy given a comic treatment; such scenes were sometimes staged as light relief at [[tournament]]s.&lt;ref&gt;[[Roger Sherman Loomis|Loomis, Roger Sherman]], "The Allegorical Siege in the Art of the Middle Ages", ''American Journal of Archaeology'', Vol. 23, No. 3 (Jul.–Sep., 1919), pp.&amp;nbsp;255–269,[https://www.jstor.org/stable/497460 JSTOR (free)]&lt;/ref&gt;

The Power of Women theme is especially popular in [[Northern Renaissance]] art from the sixteenth century, which depicts "images drawn from historical, mythological, and biblical sources that illustrate women's power over men, specifically as a result of their sexual attractiveness".&lt;ref&gt;Salomon, 87&lt;/ref&gt; Several of the stories involve the killing of the male, and this and their religious context effectively remove much of the comic potential of the group, but by no means the erotic possibilites exploited by many artists.

The question of the attitudes shown towards violence by women in the cause of virtue is perhaps best seen in the figure of [[Jael]], whose killing of Sisera by hammering a tent peg into his head makes an especially graphic image. According to some feminist critics, depictions of her turned hostile in the Renaissance, and like Judith she is certainly grouped with "bad" figures such as Herodias and Delilah. Yet she was included, with Judith and Esther, as one of [[Hans Burgkmair]]'s "Drei Gut Judin" ("Three Good Jewesses") trio of Biblical heroines in his ''Eighteen Worthies'', adding nine women to the traditional male [[Nine Worthies]].&lt;ref&gt;Russell, 29&amp;ndash;39, No 1; Wolfthal, Diane (October 2000). Images of Rape: The Heroic Tradition and its Alternatives. Cambridge University Press. p. 123. {{ISBN|0521794420}}; Bohn, Babette (2005). The Artemisia Files "Death, Dispassion and the Female Hero:Gentileschi's Jael and Sisera". Chicago: University of Chicago Press. {{ISBN|0226035824}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Artemisia Gentileschi - Giuditta decapita Oloferne - Google Art Project-Adjust.jpg|thumb|left|260px|[[Artemisia Gentileschi]], ''[[Judith Slaying Holofernes (Artemisia Gentileschi)|Judith killing Holofernes]]'', version in Florence, 1621]]

The Power of Women subjects are seen in painting and other media, but [[old master print|prints]] were their special home. [[Lucas van Leyden]] made two sets of [[woodcut]]s known as ''[[Lucas van Leyden|The Large and Small Power of Women]]''. The subjects featured include [[Adam and Eve]], Samson and Delilah, King Solomon, [[Herod the Great|Herod]] and Herodias, Jael and Sisera, and, less usually, [[Jezebel]] and [[Ahab|King Ahab]]. The woodcuts have somewhat static compositions, and it has been suggested that they draw from [[tableaux vivants]] of the scenes.&lt;ref&gt;Russell, pp. 119, 153, Large: Nos 90, 96, 100; Small: Nos 66, 92; Snyder, 461-462. The small set, of 1516&amp;ndash;19 included the scenes with Eve, Jael, Delilah, Solomon, Jezebel and Herodias, the large set of c. 1512 added Virgil and the legend of the ''[[Bocca della Verità]]'' or "Mouth of Truth" in Rome. The ''Aristotle and Phyllis'' of c. 1515 is in the same format but may be a later addition. Since no museum has a full set on the same paper they may have been sold mainly singly.&lt;/ref&gt; Another set by [[Hans Burgkmair]] (1519) is known as the ''Liebestorheiten'' or ''Follies of Love''.&lt;ref&gt;Russell, p. 160, Nos 94, 97. This set contains: ''Samson and Delilah'', Bathsheba and David, The Idolatry of Solomon, and Phyllis riding Aristotle.&lt;/ref&gt; At the same time there was also an interest, often among the same artists, in women from similar settings who were powerless, or only able to escape their situations by suicide, such as [[Susanna (Book of Daniel)|Susanna]], [[Dido of Carthage]], [[Lucretia]], and [[Verginia]].&lt;ref&gt;Russell, Nos 1&amp;ndash;14&lt;/ref&gt; The story of [[Esther]] lay somewhere between these two extremes.&lt;ref&gt;Russell, Nos 1, 15, 16&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Little Masters]] were among those artists greatly interested in both groups. The treatment of both groups, especially in prints, was often frankly erotic, and these groups took their place alongside female saints and lovers both mythological and realistic in the common treatments of women in art. Interest in such themes spread to Italy, affecting [[Venice]] first, and the subjects became common in Late Renaissance Italian painting, and even more so during the Baroque, perhaps culminating in the work of [[Artemisia Gentileschi]], who painted nearly all the biblical Power of Women subjects, most more than once. While her choice of subjects is assumed to be driven by her difficult life, [[Cristofano Allori]]'s best known work, ''Judith with the Head of Holofernes'', uses as models his former mistress for [[Book of Judith|Judith]], with her mother as the maid, and a self-portrait for the head of [[Holofernes]].&lt;ref&gt;Lucy Whitaker, Martin Clayton, ''The Art of Italy in the Royal Collection; Renaissance and Baroque'', p.270, Royal Collection Publications, 2007, {{ISBN|9781902163291}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Northern painting, the Cranachs were the first artists to paint the subjects often.&lt;ref&gt;Ainsworth, p. 66&lt;/ref&gt; In 1513 [[Lucas Cranach the Elder]] decorated the nuptial bed of [[John, Elector of Saxony]] with a set of scenes including ''The Idolatry of Solomon'' as well as ''[[Hercules]] and [[Omphale]]'' (see below) and the ''[[Judgement of Paris]]''. The respective sons of the patron and artist, [[John Frederick I, Elector of Saxony]] and [[Lucas Cranach the Younger]], generated another set of paintings, now in the [[Gemäldegalerie Alte Meister]].&lt;ref&gt;Ainsworth, p. 62&lt;/ref&gt; The possibility has been raised that some of the Cranach workshop's many ''Judith''s are portraits of ladies at the Saxon court;&lt;ref&gt;Ainsworth, pp. 63&amp;ndash;66&lt;/ref&gt; some other paintings of Jael certainly are portraits.

===Themes and context===
[[File:Lucas van Leyden Arisztotelész és Phyllis.jpg|thumb|left|''Phyllis Riding Aristotle'', [[Lucas van Leyden]]]]
Several of these subjects contain a part-comical element of [[role reversal]] in a society that was essentially patriarchal, above all the "quintessential image from the Power of Women topos, ''Phyllis Riding Aristotle''."&lt;ref&gt;Russell, p. 175&lt;/ref&gt; The story of Phyllis and Aristotle dates from the early 13th century (when the ''Lai d'Aristote'' was written) and became the subject of popular poems, plays and moralizing sermons.&lt;ref&gt;Boitani &amp; Torti p. 82&lt;/ref&gt; The theme was first analysed by [[Natalie Zemon Davis]] in 1975,&lt;ref&gt;"Women on Top" in her ''Society and Culture in Early Modern France: Eight Essays, Stanford, California: Stanford University Press, 1975''&lt;/ref&gt; who concluded that the "overall functions" of these reversals was that "they afforded an expression of, and an outlet for, conflicts about authority within the system; and they also provided occasions by which the authoritarian current in family, workshop, and political life could be moderated by the laughter of disorder and paradoxical play. Accordingly they served to reinforce hierarchical structure".&lt;ref&gt;Natalie Zemon Davis, "Women on Top", quoted by Russell, p. 175&lt;/ref&gt; The role reversal subject of [[Hercules]] and [[Omphale]] did not fit the main Power of Women trope, as Hercules' period serving Omphale was not caused by interaction between them, and they later married. It became popular from the 16th century, and the Cranach family painted many versions showing Omphale and her ladies dressing Hercules in drag.&lt;ref&gt;For a long analysis of the theme, see Rosenthal, Lisa, "Hercules' Distaff", especially p. 128 ff, in ''Gender, Politics, and Allegory in the Art of Rubens'', 2005, Cambridge University Press, {{ISBN|0521842441}}, 9780521842440, [https://books.google.com/books?id=tIa0iUVpGbcC&amp;pg=PA128 Google Books]&lt;/ref&gt;

''Phyllis Riding Aristotle'' was painted on the walls of several German [[town hall]]s,&lt;ref&gt;Russell, p. 150; Parshall, pp. 234-235&lt;/ref&gt; though the design [[Albrecht Dürer]] made for [[Nuremberg]], as part of a Power of Women cycle, was never carried out.&lt;ref&gt;Foister p. 2&lt;/ref&gt; Some sets of prints have ornamental borders that suggest they were intended to be pasted to walls, as many larger prints were. While many of the smaller prints were probably mostly seen by male collectors and their friends, these paintings and wall-mounted prints "must have been intended to entertain or amuse both men and women".&lt;ref&gt;Russell, p. 150; Parshall, pp. 234&amp;ndash;235. Dürer's [[watercolour]] design is in the [[Morgan Library]] ([[:File:Albrecht Dürer - Design for Decoration of the Town Hall of Nuremberg.jpg|see Commons image]]), and has roundels with Bathsheba and David, [[Samson and Delilah (disambiguation)|Samson and Delilah]], and Phyllis riding Aristotle.&lt;/ref&gt; Some of the Florentine [[Otto prints]], essentially designed for a female audience, show women triumphing over men, though most show pacific scenes of lovers.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.britishmuseum.org/research/collection_online/collection_object_details.aspx?objectId=756921&amp;partId=1 example, British Museum]. This collection, in the [[British Museum]] is the pattern book of a workshop probably making inserts for small boxes of sweet delicacies such as were given to the guests at weddings.&lt;/ref&gt;

Other large prints intended for walls, where Power of Women subjects are especially common, adopt a different type of composition from the small prints with a few figures, showing large and well-populated panoramic scenes where the key figures can be hard to pick out. ''David and Bathsheba'' or Salome's story are set amid wide townscapes, and Judith kills Holofernes in a corner of a huge battle scene in front of a walled city.&lt;ref&gt;Bartrum, p. 154, Nos. 96, 158, 160; Parshall, pp. 234-235&lt;/ref&gt;

The association of witchcraft specifically and almost exclusively with women was a novelty of the late 15th century, for which the book ''[[Malleus Maleficarum]]'' (1486) remains an emblem, though its significance has been questioned. The interpretation of the many images of witches has been the subject of considerable scholarly interest in recent decades, and many differing interpretations have been put forward. As well as allowing scope for imaginative fantasy, an erotic element is clear, above all in the work of [[Hans Baldung Grien]], the artist most associated with the subject. The seriousness with which either the artist or their audience took the reality of witchcraft has been questioned; to some extent these seem to have been the [[horror movie]]s of their day.&lt;ref&gt;Zika, Charles, "Images of Witchcraft in Early Modern Europe", in Levack, Brian P. (ed), ''The Oxford Handbook of Witchcraft in Early Modern Europe and Colonial America'', 2013, Oxford University Press, {{ISBN|0199578168}}, 9780199578160, [https://books.google.com/books?id=Lum96_FPZp0C&amp;pg=PA143 Google Books]; Russell, pp. 14, 147&amp;ndash;148, Nos 103&amp;ndash;105; Harbison, Craig. ''The Art of the Northern Renaissance'', pp. 120&amp;ndash;121, 1995, Weidenfeld &amp; Nicolson, {{ISBN|0297835122}}; Bartrum, 69&amp;ndash;70; there is a further account of the development of scholarship by Zika in [https://books.google.com/books?id=SRvhAQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA48 pp. 48&amp;ndash;65 here]&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Witch of Endor]] was a previously obscure subject that allowed the combination of biblical and witchcraft interest.

A '''science fair''' experiment is generally a competition where contestants present their [[science project]], results in the form of a report, [[display board]], and/or models that they have created. Science fairs allow students in elementary, middle and high schools to compete in science and/or technology activities.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.eduplace.com/science/profdev/science_fair/whatis.html|title=What is a science fair project?|last= Fredericks |first=Anthony D.|date=2000|website=Science Fair Handbook|publisher=Houghton Mifflin Company|access-date=8 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The main motive of a science fair is for students to answer a question or task, not from a textbook but found out themselves by conducting a range of experiments and ongoing research in the short amount of time allocated to them. In order that the questions or tasks spark a true interest in the student they should be able to have an interesting, eye catching project often portrayed on a [[display board]].

Science fairs also provide a mechanism for students with intense interest in the sciences to be paired with mentors from nearby colleges and universities, so that they can access to instruction and equipment that the local schools can not provide.

== History ==
Science fairs date back to 1942, when [[William Emerson Ritter]] and [[Edward W. Scripps]] created "[[The Science Talent Search]]" for high school students. 
The first American National Science Fair was won by '''Alan J. Fletcher''' when he was 18, winning with a display on the [[laws of motion]].
In the [[United States]], science fairs became popular in the early 1950s. Interest in the sciences was at a new high after the world witnessed the use of the first two [[atomic weapon]]s and the dawn of [[television]]. As the decade progressed, science stories in the news, such as [[Jonas Salk]]'s [[vaccine for polio]] and the launch of [[Sputnik]], brought science fiction to reality and attracted increasing numbers of students to fairs.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.streetdirectory.com/travel_guide/118515/science/a_history_of_science_fairs.html|title=A History of Science Fairs|last=Cox|first=Jimmy|date=|website=|publisher= Streetdirectory|access-date=8 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Science fair competitions ==
Most countries have regional science fairs in which interested students can freely participate. Winners of these regional fairs send students to national fairs such as [[ISEF]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://findafair.societyforscience.org/|title=Student Science - Find a Fair|website=findafair.societyforscience.org|access-date=2018-11-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Canada-Wide Science Fair|CWSF]]. National science fairs typically send winners to international fairs such as ISEF (which is a national and an international science fair) and [[EUCYS]].

'''Social information processing''' is "an activity through which collective human actions organize knowledge."&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

}}
&lt;/ref&gt; It is the creation and processing of information by a group of people. As an academic field Social Information Processing studies the [[information processing]] power of networked [[social system]]s.

Typically computer tools are used such as:

* Authoring tools: e.g., [[blogs]]
* Collaboration tools: e.g., [[wikis]], in particular, e.g., [[Wikipedia]]
* Translating tools: [[Duolingo]], [[reCAPTCHA]]
* [[Tag (metadata)|Tagging]] systems (social bookmarking): e.g., [[del.icio.us]], [[Flickr]], [[CiteULike]]
* [[Social networking]]: e.g., [[Facebook]], [[MySpace]], [[Essembly]]
* [[Collaborative filtering]]: e.g., [[Digg]], the [[Amazon.com|Amazon Product Recommendation System]], [[Yahoo! Answers]], [[Urtak]]

Although computers are often used to facilitate networking and collaboration, they are not required. For example the ''[[Trictionary]]'' in 1982 was entirely paper and pen based, relying on neighborhood social networks and libraries. The creation of the ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]'' in the 19th century was done largely with the help of anonymous volunteers organized by help wanted adds in newspapers and slips of paper sent through the postal mail.

==Current state of knowledge==
The website for the AAAI 2008 Spring Symposium on Social Information Processing suggested the following topics and questions:&lt;ref&gt;http://www.isi.edu/~lerman/sss07/&lt;/ref&gt;

; Tagging : [[Tag (metadata)|Tagging]] has already attracted the interest of the AI community. While the initial purpose of tagging was to help users organize and manage their own documents, it has since been proposed that collective tagging of common documents can be used to organize information via an informal classification system dubbed a [[folksonomy]]. There is hope{{Who|date=July 2011}} that folksonomies will eventually help fulfill the promise of the Semantic Web.

; [[Human-based computation]] and [[collective intelligence]] : What type of problems are amenable to human swarm computing approaches? How can we design the "[[wisdom of crowds]]" effect to benefit our problem solving needs?

; Incentives to [[online participation|participation]] : How to elicit quality metadata and content from users? How can users resistant to tagging be encouraged to tag content?

; [[Social networks]]: While users create social networks for a variety of reasons – e.g., to track lives of friends or work or opinions of the users they respect – network information is important for many applications. Globally, an [[information ecosystem]] may arise through the interactions among users, and between users and content. A community of users interested in a specific topic may emerge over time, with linkages to other communities giving insight into relationships between topics.

; Evolution of [[social media]] and information ecosystems : How does content, and its quality, change in time? There is increasing interest in peer-production systems, for example in how and why some open-source projects like Linux and Wikipedia are successful. Under what circumstances are user-generated content sites likely to succeed and what implications does this have for information-sharing and learning within communities?

; Algorithms : Before we can harness the power of the social information processing, we need new approaches to structured data analysis, specifically algorithms for synthesizing various types of [[metadata]]: e.g., social networks and tagging. Research in this area will provide a principled foundation for the development of new algorithms for [[social search]], [[information discovery]] and [[personalization]] and other approaches that exploit the power of the social information processing.

==Key concepts==
===Social Recommender Systems===
''Social overload'' corresponds to being imposed to high amount of information and interaction on social web. Social overload causes some challenges from the aspect of both social media websites and their users.&lt;ref name=Guy2015&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Guy|first1=Ido|title=Social Recommender Systems|journal=Recommender Systems Handbook|date=1 January 2015|pages=511–543|doi=10.1007/978-1-4899-7637-6_15|url=https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-1-4899-7637-6_15|publisher=Springer US|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Users need to deal with high volume of information and to make decisions among different social network applications whereas social network sites try to keep their existing users and make their sites interesting to users. To overcome social overload, ''social recommender systems'' has been utilized to engage users in social media websites in a way that users receive more personalized content using recommendation techniques.&lt;ref name=Guy2015 /&gt; Social recommender systems are specific types of recommendation systems being designed for social media and utilizing new sort of data brought by it, such as likes, comments, tags and so on, to improve effectiveness of recommendations. Recommendation in social media have several aspects like recommendation of social media content, people, groups and tags.

==== Content ====
Social media lets users to provide feedback on the content produced by users of social media websites, by means of commenting on or liking the content shared by others and annotating their own-created content via tagging. This newly introduced metadata by social media helps to obtain recommendations for social media content with improved effectiveness.&lt;ref name=Guy2015 /&gt; Also, social media lets to extract the explicit relationship between users such as friendship and people followed/followers. This provides further improvement on collaborative filtering systems because now users can have judgement on the recommendations provided based on the people they have relationships.&lt;ref name=Guy2015 /&gt; There have been studies showing the effectiveness of recommendation systems which utilize relationships among users on social media compared to traditional collaborative filtering based systems, specifically for movie and book recommendation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Sinha|first=Rashmi|last2=Swearingen|first2=Kirsten|date=|year=2001|title=Comparing Recommendations Made by Online Systems and Friends|url=|journal=DELOS workshop: Personalisation and Recommender Systems in Digital Libraries|volume=106|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Golbeck|first=Jennifer|date=2006-05-16|title=Generating Predictive Movie Recommendations from Trust in Social Networks|url=https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/11755593_8|journal=Trust Management|language=en|publisher=Springer, Berlin, Heidelberg|pages=93–104|doi=10.1007/11755593_8}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another improvement brought by social media to recommender systems is solving the cold start problem for new users.&lt;ref name=Guy2015 /&gt;

Some key application areas of social media content recommendation are blog and blog post recommendation, multimedia content recommendation such as YouTube videos, question and answer recommendation to question askers and answerers on social  [[Comparison of Q&amp;A sites|question-and-answer websites]], job recommendation (LinkedIn), news recommendation on social new aggregator sites (like Digg, GoogleReader, Reddit etc.), short message recommendations on microblogs (such as Twitter).&lt;ref name=Guy2015 /&gt;

==== People ====
Also known as ''social matching'' (the term is proposed by Terveen and McDonald), people recommender systems deal with recommending people to people on social media. Aspects making people recommender systems distinct from traditional recommender systems and require special attention are basically privacy, trust among users, and reputation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Terveen|first=Loren|last2=McDonald|first2=David W.|date=2005-09-01|title=Social Matching: A Framework and Research Agenda|url=http://doi.acm.org/10.1145/1096737.1096740|journal=ACM Trans. Comput.-Hum. Interact.|volume=12|issue=3|pages=401–434|doi=10.1145/1096737.1096740|issn=1073-0516}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are several factors which effect the choice of recommendation techniques for people recommendation on social networking sites (SNS). Those factors are related to types of relationships among people on social networking sites, such as symmetric vs asymmetric, ad-hoc vs long-term, and confirmed vs nonconfirmed relationships.&lt;ref name=Guy2015 /&gt;

The scope of people recommender systems can be categorized into three:&lt;ref name=Guy2015 /&gt; recommending familiar people to connect with, recommending people to follow and recommending strangers. Recommending strangers is seen as valuable as  recommending familiar people because of leading to chances such as exchanging ideas, obtaining new opportunities, and increasing one’s reputation.

====Challenges ====
Handling with social streams is one of the challenges social recommender systems face with.&lt;ref name=Guy2015 /&gt; Social stream can be described as the user activity data pooled on newsfeed on social media websites. Social stream data has unique characteristics such as rapid flow, variety of data (only text content vs heterogenous content), and requiring freshness. Those unique properties of stream data compared to traditional social media data impose challenges on social recommender systems.
Another challenge in social recommendation is performing cross-domain recommendation, as in traditional recommender systems.&lt;ref name=Guy2015 /&gt; The reason is that social media websites in different domains include different information about users, and merging information within different contexts may not lead to useful recommendations. For example, using favorite recipes of users in one social media site may not be a reliable source of information to effective job recommendations for them.

===Social awareness===

Participation of people in online communities, in general, differ from their participatory behavior in real-world collective contexts. Humans in daily life are used to making use of "social cues" for guiding their decisions and actions e.g. if a group of people is looking for a good restaurant to have lunch, it is very likely that they will choose to enter to a local that have some customers inside instead of one that it is empty (the more crowded restaurant could reflect its popularity and in consequence, its quality of service). However, in online social environments, it is not straightforward how to access to these sources of information which are normally being logged in the systems, but this is not disclosed to the users.

There are some theories that explain how this social awareness can affect the behavior of people in real-life scenarios. The American philosopher [[George Herbert Mead]] states that humans are social creatures, in the sense that people's actions cannot be isolated from the behavior of the whole collective they are part of because every individuals' act are influenced by larger social practices that act as a general behavior's framework.&lt;ref name="Mead1934"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Mind, Self, and Society: From the Standpoint of a Social Behaviorist|last=Mead|first=George. H.|publisher=University of Chicago Press|year=1934|isbn=|location=Chicago|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In his performance framework, the Canadian sociologist [[Erving Goffman]] postulates that in everyday social interactions individuals perform their actions by collecting information from others first, in order to know in advance what they may expect from them and in this way being able to plan how to behave more effectively.&lt;ref name="Goffman 1990 p. "&gt;{{cite book | last=Goffman | first=Erving | title=The presentation of self in everyday life | publisher=Penguin | location=London | year=1990 | isbn=978-0-14-013571-8 | page=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Benefits====

In the same way that in the real-world, providing social cues in virtual communities can help people to understand better the situations they face in these environments, to alleviate their decision-making processes by enabling their access to more informed choices, to persuade them to participate in the activities that take place there, and to structure their own schedule of individual and group activities more efficiently.&lt;ref name="DingErickson2011"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Ding|first1=Xianghua|last2=Erickson|first2=Thomas|last3=Kellogg|first3=Wendy A.|last4=Patterson|first4=Donald J.|title=Informing and performing: investigating how mediated sociality becomes visible|journal=Personal and Ubiquitous Computing|volume=16|issue=8|year=2011|pages=1095–1117|issn=1617-4909|doi=10.1007/s00779-011-0443-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In this frame of reference, an approach called "social context displays" has been proposed for showing social information -either from real or virtual environments- in digital scenarios. It is based on the use of graphical representations to visualize the presence and activity traces of a group of people, thus providing users with a third-party view of what is happening within the community i.e. who are actively participating, who are not contributing to the group efforts, etc. This social-context-revealing approach has been studied in different scenarios (e.g. IBM video-conference software, large community displaying social activity traces in a shared space called NOMATIC*VIZ), and it has been demonstrated that its application can provide users with several benefits, like providing them with more information to make better decisions and motivating them to take an active attitude towards the management of  their self and group representations within the display through their actions in the real-life.&lt;ref name="DingErickson2011"/&gt;

====Concerns====

By making the traces of activity of users publicly available for others to access it is natural that it can raise users concerns related to which are their rights over the data they generate, who are the final users that can have access to their information and how they can know and control their privacy policies.&lt;ref name="DingErickson2011"/&gt; There are several perspectives that try to contextualize this privacy issue. One perspective is to see privacy as a tradeoff between the degree of invasion to the personal space and the number of benefits that the user could perceive from the social system by disclosing their online activity traces.&lt;ref name="PatilLai2005"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Patil|first1=Sameer|last2=Lai|first2=Jennifer|title=Who gets to know what when: configuring privacy permissions in an awareness application|year=2005|pages=101|doi=10.1145/1054972.1054987}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another perspective is examining the concession between the visibility of people within the social system and their level of privacy, which can be managed at an individual or at a group level by establishing specific permissions for allowing others to have access to their information. Other authors state that instead of enforcing users to set and control privacy settings, social systems might focus on raising their awareness about who their audiences are so they can manage their online behavior according to the reactions they expect from those different user groups.&lt;ref name="DingErickson2011"/&gt;

== History ==

SpaceTEC® was established in 2002 as an NSF National Center of Excellence funded in part by a three-year NSF Advanced Technological Education Program grant and renewed in 2005 for an additional four years. SpaceTEC® was awarded a four-year follow-on grant in 2009 as an NSF National Resource Center, and in April, 2013, it received a four-year renewal of its NSF grant.  The Center is now expanding operations to Science, technology, engineering, and mathematics ([[STEM fields]]) technicians working in technical fields beyond aerospace through its ‘’’CertTEC®’’’ commercial industry credentials.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.questionmark.com/us/casestudies/Pages/spacetec.aspx QuestionMark Case Study].

The original consortium of industry, academia, and government representatives was known as the Community Colleges for Innovative Technology Transfer, a not-for-profit Florida corporation founded in 1994 to provide technician education for [[geographic information systems]]. Community Colleges for Innovative Technology Transfer received one of the first [[National Science Foundation]] grants for two-year community and technical colleges. The founding partners were all located near NASA or Department of Defense locations, providing a consortium strongly linked to post-secondary education programs for the nation’s technical workforce in [[aerospace]] and defense.

[[File:Coa_Illustration_Cross_Triquetra.svg|right|thumb|Interlaced triquetra which is a [[trefoil knot]]]]
'''Triquetra''' ({{IPAc-en|t|r|aɪ|ˈ|k|w|ɛ|t|r|ə}}; from the Latin adjective ''triquetrus'', three-cornered) denotes a particular complicated shape formed of three ''[[Vesica piscis|vesicae piscis]]'' (the leaf-like shape in between two equal diameter circles each centered on the circumference of the other), sometimes with an added circle in or around the three lobes. Also known as a "trinity knot" when parallel doubled-lines are in the graph, the design is used as a religious symbol adapted from ancient Pagan Celtic images by Christianity. It is similar to Odin's symbol, the [[valknut]].

==Ancient usage==

===Celtic art===
The triquetra is often found in [[insular art]], most notably metal work and in [[illuminated manuscript]]s like the ''[[Book of Kells]]''. It is also found in similar artwork on Celtic crosses and slabs from the early Christian period. The fact that the triquetra rarely stood alone in medieval Celtic art has cast reasonable doubt on its use as a primary symbol of belief. In manuscripts it is used primarily as a space filler or ornament in much more complex compositions, and in knotwork panels it is a design motif integrated with other design elements.  This widely recognised knot has been used as a singular symbol for the past two centuries by Celtic Christians, pagans and agnostics as a sign of special things and people that are threefold.&lt;ref&gt;Walker, Stephen (2001). "[http://www.celtarts.com/in_search_of_meaning.htm In Search of Meaning]", ''Dalriada Magazine''.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Japanese use===
The triquetra has been a known symbol in Japan called ''Musubi Mitsugashiwa''. Being one of the forms of the [[Aryan]] [[Ikshvaku dynasty|Iakšaku dynasty]] signs, it reached Japan with the dynasty's [[Kāśyapīya]] spreading technology and [[Buddhism]] via [[Kingdom of Khotan]], after which the Japanese sword [[katana]] is called, [[Chinese Buddhism|China]] and [[Korean Buddhism|Korea]].{{Citation needed|date=January 2018}}

===Germanic paganism===
The triquetra has been found on [[runestone]]s in Northern Europe and on early [[Germanic peoples|Germanic]] coins. It presumably had [[Germanic paganism|pagan]] religious meaning and it bears a resemblance to the ''[[valknut]]'', a symbol associated with [[Odin]].

===Christian use===
The symbol has been used in [[Christian Church|Christian]] tradition as a sign of the [[Trinity]] ([[God the Father|Father]], [[Jesus Christ|Son]] and [[Holy Spirit]]), especially since the Celtic revival of the 19th century. When modern designers began to display the triquetra as a stand-alone design, it recalled the three-leafed shamrock which was similarly offered as a Trinity symbol by Saint Patrick{{citation needed|date=November 2014}}. 
It has also been suggested that the triquetra has a similarity to the Christian [[Ichthys|Ιχθυς]] symbol. The triquetra has been used extensively on Christian sculpture, vestments, book arts and stained glass. It has been used on the title page and binding of some editions of the [[New King James Version]]{{examples|date=November 2014}}.

A very common representation of the symbol is with a circle that goes through the three interconnected loops of the triquetra. The circle emphasises the unity of the whole combination of three forces. It is also said to symbolise [[God]]'s love around the Holy Trinity.

==Modern use==
In contemporary Ireland, it is traditional for lovers to exchange jewelry such as a necklace or rings signifying their affection. The triquetra, also known as a "trinity knot", is often found as a design element is popular Irish jewelry such as [[Claddagh ring|claddaghs]] and other wedding or engagement rings.&lt;ref&gt;McMahon, Seán (1999). ''Story of the Claddagh Ring''. Mercier Press. {{ISBN|9781856351898}}.&lt;/ref&gt;{{page missing|date=October 2018}}

===Neopaganism===
It is difficult to date the exact origin of the Irish triquetra, and whether it was first used in a Christian or [[Celtic polytheism|pagan]] context; the distinctive interlace/knotwork artistic style did not fully develop until ca. the 7th century AD, but the triquetra is the [[trefoil knot|simplest possible knot]]. [[Celtic neopaganism|Celtic pagans]], or even [[Neopaganism|neopagans]] who are not of a Celtic cultural orientation, may use the triquetra to symbolise a variety of concepts and mythological figures.

Due to its presence in insular Celtic art, [[Celtic Reconstructionist Paganism|Celtic Reconstructionists]] use the triquetra either to represent one of the various triplicities in their cosmology and theology (such as the tripartite division of the world into the realms of Land, Sea and Sky),&lt;ref name="Mac Mathúna"&gt;Mac Mathúna, Liam (1999) [http://www.celt.dias.ie/publications/celtica/c23/c23-174.pdf "Irish Perceptions of the Cosmos"] ''Celtica'' vol. 23 (1999), pp.174–187&lt;/ref&gt; or as a symbol of one of the specific Celtic [[Triple deity|triple goddesses]], for example the battle goddess, [[The Morrígan]].

[[Germanic Neopaganism|Germanic neopagan]] groups who use the triquetra to symbolise their faith generally believe it is originally of Norse and Germanic origins.

The symbol is also sometimes used by wiccans and some [[new age]]rs to symbolise the [[Triple Goddess (Neopaganism)|Triple Goddess]], or as a protective symbol.&lt;ref name="scott-cunningham"&gt;{{Citation |last=Cunningham |first=Scott |authorlink=Scott Cunningham |title=Wicca: A Guide to the Solitary Practitioner |year=2004 |origyear=1988 |publisher=Llewellyn |location=Woodbury, MN, U.S.A. |isbn=978-0-87542-118-6 |page=191 |chapter=Rune Magic}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Popular culture===
&lt;!-- Do not add more pop culture mentions here unless they are 1. sourced and 2.vplay a significant role in the symbology or identification of the referenced subject. Other additions will be deleted as spam. --&gt;

The triquetra is often used artistically as a design element when [[Celtic knotwork]] is used. Many who identify as [[modern Celts]] may use the symbol to display an identification with [[Celtic Europe|Celtic culture]], whether they live in the [[Celtic Nations]] or the [[diaspora]].

====In literature and publications====
*The double triquetra is used to represent the Holy Trinity on the ''New King James Version'' [[Bibles]], published by Thomas Nelson, Inc

====In television====
*[[Michonne]]'s [[katana]] in the TV series ''[[The Walking Dead (TV series)|The Walking Dead]]'' features a triquetra on the inner [[crossguard]]. Custom-designed for the character, propmaster John Sanders intentionally chose the triquetra for its meaning as a triple goddess symbol.&lt;ref name=EW&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ew.com/gallery/walking-dead-14-props-and-stories-behind-em/670478_michonnes-katana | title=Michonne's Katana | publisher=''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'' | date=17 November 2013 | accessdate=30 October 2016 | author=Ross, Dalton |author2=Snetiker, Marc}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=USAtoday&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/tv/2014/10/08/walkers-weapons-bees-at-amc-the-walking-dead/16886945/ | title=&lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt;The Walking Dead,' up close and personal | publisher=[[USA Today]] | date=12 October 2014 | accessdate=30 October 2016 | last=Keveney | first=Bill | quote=We put a trinity on there – mind, body, soul.
