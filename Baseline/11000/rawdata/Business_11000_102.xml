'''Amir Reko''' (born 1963), known by his ''[[nom de guerre]]'' '''Makedonac''' ("the Macedonian"), is a [[Bosnia and Herzegovina|Bosnian]]-[[Denmark|Danish]] entrepreneur, formerly military officer in the [[Yugoslav People's Army]] (JNA), and a commander in the [[Army of the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina]] (ARBiH) during the [[Bosnian War]] (1992–1995).

An ethnic [[Bosniak]], Reko was born in the hamlet of Gudelj of the village [[Jošanica, Foča|Jošanica]] in [[Foča]] in eastern Bosnia.{{sfn|Ličnosti}} During [[World War II in Yugoslavia|World War II]] his grandmother was saved by a [[Serbs|Serb]].{{sfn|DW 2017}} He finished primary school in the village of [[Ustikolina]], after which he moved to [[Sarajevo]] on higher studies, finishing middle technical school in 1982.{{sfn|Ličnosti}} He finished the Army military school in 1986 as an infantry.{{sfn|Ličnosti}} He served as an officer (''časnik'') in [[Novo Mesto]] (in Slovenia), [[Gospić]] (Croatia), [[Pljevlja]] (Montenegro), [[Bitola]] (Macedonia), [[Zaječar]] (Serbia).{{sfn|Ličnosti}}

Reko deserted from the JNA in April 1992.{{sfn|DW 2017}} While wanting to preserve "[[Brotherhood and Unity]]", the real situation, when the war spilled over into Bosnia and his home village, forced him to leave the JNA.{{sfn|B92 2017}} He had received information that Serb forces occupied Foča and his village.{{sfn|B92 2017}} He contacted his ethnic Serb friend and JNA colleague Dragan Simić stationed in [[Niš]], and told him that he was to leave to be with his family.{{sfn|B92 2017}} Simić offered to help, and the two went for Bosnia.{{sfn|B92 2017}} They crossed Serb-held territory into Bosniak-held territory in [[Goražde]] where Reko believed his family took refuge.{{sfn|DW 2017}} His colleague saved him from Bosnian Serb policemen at [[Ustiprača]].{{sfn|DW 2017}}

Reko became the first commander of the 43rd Drina Assault Brigade ({{lang|bs|43. Drinska udarna brigada}}) of ARBiH, based in Goražde.{{sfn|DW 2017}} His high rank came as the result of his Military Academy diploma.{{sfn|DW 2017}} His ''nom de guerre'' became ''Makedonac'' due to his years of service in Bitola.{{sfn|DW 2017}} He was unable to meet up with his family in Gudelj, as that village was under [[Army of Republika Srpska]] (VRS) control.{{sfn|DW 2017}} Serb soldiers killed his mother Aziza and grandfather (along with five other family members{{sfn|B92 2017}}) while [[ethnic cleansing|cleansing]] the village of the remaining people, through setting a house which held them on fire.{{sfn|DW 2017}} Reko has stated that he knows of the perpetrators, and that one lives in Canada.{{sfn|B92 2017}} A few days after, the Municipal headquarters of the Territorial Defense ordered that the Serb village of Bučje be cleansed as it posed a threat due to VRS progress.{{sfn|DW 2017}} While an ideal chance for revenge, Reko refused, and was called weak and a traitor.{{sfn|DW 2017}} He organized talks with the Bučje inhabitants for the peaceful surrender of them and their weapons.{{sfn|DW 2017}} As a result, the village's 45 Serbs and few Bosniaks were saved.{{sfn|DW 2017}} Reko learnt that he was an assassination target due to saving Serbs, and that orders came from people currently in the Bosnian government.{{sfn|B92 2017}} After the war he set up a memorial to the killed members of his family.{{sfn|DW 2017}}

After the war, he moved to [[Denmark]].{{sfn|Ličnosti}} He became a successful businessman,{{sfn|DW 2017}} and established a family, with two children.{{sfn|B92 2017}} He and his wife eventually divorced.{{sfn|B92 2017}} In 2008, he met with his childhood romance Azra in Bosnia, who was a widow with two children.{{sfn|B92 2017}} They eventually married.{{sfn|B92 2017}}

He owns a Danish-Bosnian company "Bohen" that produces gaskets, parts of rubber and plastic and parts for water and heating.{{sfn|Ličnosti}} He currently lives in Denmark with his family.{{sfn|Ličnosti}} Reko established the political movement "Most 21", aimed at a multi-ethnic unitary state.{{sfn|B92 2017}}

A documentary on his life was made in 2016, called ''Makedonac''.{{sfn|DW 2017}} There is plans of a movie.{{sfn|DW 2017}} He has been interviewed by various newspapers and guested TV shows such as [[RTRS]]'s ''Telering'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=RTRS - TELERING 05.7.2017.|publisher=RTRS (via YouTube)|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDs63ZCNY2M}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Prva Srpska Televizija|Prva]]'s ''Život Priča'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Život priča - Čov(J)ek|publisher=PRVA (via YouTube)|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QxUyzPCk4f4}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Face TV (Bosnia and Herzegovina)|Face]]'s ''Face to Face'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Amir Reko, kapetan koji je spasio 52 Srba: "Tri dana prije ubili su sve moje, ja nisam htio..."|publisher=FACE HD TV (via YouTube)|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fggXjIv5aQc}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Happy TV]]'s ''Jutarnji program'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Amir Reko, heroj koji je spasio 45 civila od smrti - Dobro jutro Srbijo - (TV Happy 11.12.2017)|publisher=Jutarnji Program TV HAPPY (via YouTube)|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osz2uC_ZiOw}}&lt;/ref&gt; Elta's ''Razgovor'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=RAZGOVOR AMIR REKO I DRAGAN SIMIC|publisher=Elta HD (via YouTube)|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ni4J95eMJAs}}&lt;/ref&gt; OSMTV's ''Lice Nacije''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=LICE NACIJE OSMTV, gosti Amir Reko i Olivera Markovic 22 11 2017|publisher=OSM Televizija (via YouTube)|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CYOVhEyhr7g}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Benny Shabtai''' ({{lang-he |בני שבתאי}}) is an Israeli-born, American [[businessman]]. He was the president and founder of [[Raymond Weil]] USA until 2009 when he sold his company. &lt;ref&gt;"[https://www.haaretz.com/jewish/.premium-transforming-israel-into-an-ivory-tower-brand-1.5338744 Transforming Israel into an ivory tower brand]" by [[James Kirchick]], ''[[Haaretz]]'', 24 March 2015&lt;/ref&gt; In 2014, Shabtai and his family sold their controlling share in [[Viber]], the Israeli instant-messaging, voice and video calling [[Mobile app|app]].&lt;ref&gt;"[https://www.algemeiner.com/2014/02/17/u-s-based-shabtai-family-to-earn-496-million-from-viber-sale/ U.S. based Shabtai family to early 496 million from Viber sale]" by [[Joshua Levitt]], ''[[Algemeiner Journal]]'', 17 February 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==
Benny Shabtai was born in [[Tel Aviv]] and raised on a [[kibbutz]]. He has two siblings. He served for three years in the [[Israel Defense Forces|Israeli army]], after which he worked as a bodyguard for the Israeli ambassador in [[Paris]], [[France]], where his father was stationed as an envoy. After two years  in Paris, he traveled to [[South Africa]], where he worked as a [[croupier]] at a casino in [[Swaziland]]. He returned to Israel to rejoin the army, serving during the 1973 [[Yom Kippur War]].&lt;ref name="forbes"&gt;{{cite news |date=6 June 2014 |title=כוכב שבתאי: כך בנה איש העסקים בני שבתאי את הונו העצום - כל הדרך מעבודה בקזינו בסווזילנד |trans-title=The Star of Shabtai: This is How the Businessman Benny Shabtai Has Amassed His Huge Fortune - All The Way from Working in a Casino in Swaziland |url=http://www.forbes.co.il/news/new.aspx?Pn6VQ=EG&amp;0r9VQ=EDFMI |language=Hebrew |newspaper=Forbes}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

==Business career==
After completing his reserve duty, Shabtai relocated to the U.S. He began working at the now defunct Eastman Watch Company, an importer of inexpensive watches from [[Hong Kong]]. At the industry's [[BaselWorld|International Watch and Jewellery Fair]] in [[Basel]], [[Switzerland]], he met Raymond Weil, the [[eponym]]ous head of the Swiss luxury watchmaker and she agreed to sell him four hundred Raymond Weil Watches, which he then sold to two clients in the U.S.&lt;ref name="forbes"/&gt;  As owner and president of Raymond Weil USA, Shabtai was the exclusive distributor in the U.S. until 2009 when he sold the company.&lt;ref name="forbes"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |date=12 March 2004 |title=Cindy Sells |url=https://www.forbes.com/2004/03/12/cx_bs_0312movers.html |newspaper=Forbes}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
 
In February 2014, the $900 million sale of [[Viber]], an Israeli instant messaging, voice and video calling [[Mobile app|app]], to Japanese company [[Rakuten]] earned the Shabtai family (Benny, his brother Gilad, and Gilad's son Ofer) some $500 million from their 55.2% stake.&lt;ref name="forbes"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|date=16 February 2014 |title=Shabtai family rakes in $500m from Viber sale|url=http://www.globes.co.il/en/article-shabtai-family-rakes-in-500m-from-viber-sale-1000917512 |newspaper=Globes |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141230231807/http://www.globes.co.il/en/article-shabtai-family-rakes-in-500m-from-viber-sale-1000917512 |archivedate=30 December 2014|df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Activism==
Shabtai is a board member{{not in source|date=March 2018}} of [[Friends of the Israel Defense Forces]] (FIDF), an American organization that supports Israeli soldiers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.fidf.org/page.aspx?pid=286 |title=National Board Members |date= |publisher=FIDF}}&lt;/ref&gt; From 1996 to 2012, he chaired{{cn|date=March 2018}} the FIDF National New York Gala Dinner at the [[Waldorf Astoria New York]], at which, in 2011, $23 million were raised.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.fidf.org/NYGalaDinner |title=Almost $23.5 Million Raised at National NY Gala Dinner! |date=22 March 2011 |publisher=FIDF |access-date=2014-12-30 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150924012416/http://www.fidf.org/NYGalaDinner |archive-date=2015-09-24 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;, while $26 million were raised the following year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.fidf.org/Page.aspx?pid=952 |title=FIDF raises $26 Million at National NY Gala Dinner |date=14 March 2012 |publisher=FIDF}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Shabtai calls his involvement with FIDF in "educating" the American people on "the sacrifices of young Israeli soldiers and the dangers they experience" as his "greatest success," adding, "It's the best thing I've done in my life. The issue is very close to me."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |date=20 March 2011 |title=שלושים שנות תמיכה |trans-title=Thirty Years of Support |url=http://www.ynet.co.il/articles/0,7340,L-4043962,00.html |language=Hebrew |newspaper=YNet }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2014, the [[Shabtai (society)|Shabtai Jewish Global Membership Society]] at [[Yale University]], established through Benny Shabtai's donation, purchased a [[New Haven, Connecticut]] mansion for $1.5 million, according to city records, as its new residence.&lt;ref&gt;"[https://www.nhregister.com/connecticut/article/Shabtai-holds-Seder-in-new-home-former-convent-11313222.php Shabtai holds Seder in new home, former convent]", ''[[New Haven Register]]'', 10 April 2017&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |date=1 December 2014 |title=1882 Mansion Gets New Lease On Life |url=http://www.newhavenindependent.org/index.php/archives/entry/society_moving_to_historic_mansion/ |newspaper=[[New Haven Independent]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal life==
Shabtai is divorced from Lori Weitz&lt;ref&gt;"[http://observer.com/2010/12/benny-shabtais-wife-gets-lonely-245-m-townhouse-for-10-m/ Benny Shabtai’s Wife Gets Lonely $24.5m Townhouse for $10m]" by Laura Kusisto, ''Commercial Observer'', 15 December 2010&lt;/ref&gt; with whom they had three children.

Searches can be made by name, issue, position or language spoken. Once an expert has been identified, their staff will set up an interview for television, radio, or print media.

'''Claritas PRIZM Premier''' is a set of geo-demographic segments for the United States, developed by Claritas Inc., (which was owned under [[Nielsen Corporation|The Nielsen Company]] umbrella from 2009-2016). It is a widely used customer segmentation system for marketing in the United States to help companies find customers, quickly and at scale. 

PRIZM® Premier combines demographics, consumer behavior and geographic data to help marketers understand, find and engage with their customers and prospects on the right channels at the right time.  

PRIZM Premier classifies every U.S. household into one of 68 consumer segments based on the household’s purchasing preferences. PRIZM Premier offers a complete set of ancillary databases and links to third-party data, allowing marketers to use data outside of their own customer files to pinpoint products and services that their best customers are most likely to use, as well as locate their best customers on the ground. PRIZM Premier enables marketers to create a complete portrait of their customers for smarter targeting. PRIZM Premier is an update to PRIZM model that featured 66 segments, and it includes new inputs for technology adoption and wealth.  

PRIZM Premier segments are numbered according to socioeconomic rank (which takes into account characteristics such as income, education, occupation and home value) and are grouped into 11 Lifestage groups and 14 social groups. Social groups are based on urbanicity and socioeconomic rank. Lifestage groups are based on age, socioeconomic rank, and the presence of children at home.

PRIZM Premier provides a seamless transition between household-level coding and geographic-level coding by providing the same segment schema at both levels. It allows a ‘downshift’ from geo-demographic to the household-level when more precision is required.

'''Co-counselling''' (spelled '''co-counseling''' in [[American and British English spelling differences|American English]]) is a grassroots method of personal change based on reciprocal peer counselling. It uses simple methods. Time is shared equally and the essential requirement of the person taking their turn in the role of counsellor is to do their best to listen and give their full attention to the other person.  It is not a discussion; the aim is to support the person in the client role to work through their own issues in a mainly self-directed way.

Co-counselling was originally formulated in the early 1950s by the American [[Harvey Jackins]] and originated in a [[schism]] in the [[Dianetics]] movement (itself in part derived from schisms in [[General Semantics]] and [[Cybernetics]]).&lt;ref&gt;Hubbard, "[http://www.dianetics.org/en_US/l-ron-hubbard/articles/terra/ Terra Incognita: The Mind] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060204155459/http://www.dianetics.org/en_US/l-ron-hubbard/articles/terra/ |date=2006-02-04 }}," ''The Explorers Journal'', winter 1949 / spring 1950 (on the bridge between cybernetics and general semantics)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.webcitation.org/query?url=http://www.geocities.com/soho/studios/8215/dia.html&amp;date=2009-10-26+02:56:00 Rich's Home Page - ''Comparison of Re-evaluation Counseling Terms and concepts with Dianetics'']&lt;/ref&gt; Jackins founded the [[Re-evaluation Counseling]] (RC) Communities, with headquarters in [[Seattle]], [[Washington (state)|Washington]], [[United States]]. His son, [[Tim Jackins]], is currently the international leader of Re-evaluation Counseling and its main affiliates.

There are a number of smaller, separate, independent organizations that have resulted from breakaways from, or re-workings of, Re-evaluation Counseling. The principal one of these is [[Co-Counselling International|Co-Counseling International]] (CCI).

==General description==
The main activity in co-counselling involves participants arranging to meet regularly in pairs to give each other peer-to-peer counselling, in turn taking the role of counsellor and client, with equal amounts of time allocated to each. Co-counselling functions by giving people an opportunity to work on whatever issues they choose with the accepting support of another person, with whom they have no actual relationship. The person in the role of counsellor acts as a facilitator to the client, sometimes as a third-party observer and sometimes as a second-party confidant. While co-counselling is sometimes practiced outside a formal organisation, formal co-counselling organisations have developed leadership and support structures, including trainings and retreats.

Safety (in the sense of being very low risk) and the sense that a co-counselling session is a safe space is important to the methods.  There are strict rules of [[confidentiality]]. In most circumstances, the counsellor may not talk about a client's session without explicit and specific permission by the client. This is stricter than in other practices where practitioners discuss clients with supervisors, colleagues and sometimes with all sorts of other people.  The peer [[Interpersonal relationship|relationship]] makes a considerable contribution to a sense of trust.

The nature of the co-counselling session opens up the possibility for people to get in touch with [[emotion]]s that they would avoid in any other circumstance.  A belief in the value of working with emotions has become a core focus of the approach.  Co-counselling training emphasizes methods for accessing and working with emotions, and co-counsellors aim to develop and improve [[emotional competence]] through the practice. Evidence as to the actual effectiveness of this method is undemonstrated.

To get involved in co-counselling, it is usually first necessary to complete a Fundamentals course. The training involves learning how to carry out the roles of client and counsellor. Trainers may be counsellors or simply experienced members of the community.  It also covers the guidelines or rules affecting co-counselling for the particular organization. Differences in approach mean that each organization normally requires completion of one of its own courses as a prerequisite for membership, even if someone has already completed a course with another organization.

==Theoretical framework and assumptions==
The original [[theory]] of co-counselling centres on the concept of distress patterns.&lt;ref&gt;Jackins, Harvey (1965); ''The human side of human beings''; Rational Island, Seattle; {{ISBN|0-911214-60-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; These are patterns of [[behaviour]], that is, behaviour that tends to be repeated in a particular type of circumstance, that are irrational, unhelpful or compulsive. The theory is that these patterns are driven by the accumulated consequences in the [[mind]] of (not currently) conscious [[Memory|memories]] of past events in which the person was unable to express or discharge the emotion appropriate to the event. Co-counselling enables release from the patterns by allowing "emotional discharge" of the past hurt experiences. Such cathartic discharge includes crying, warm perspiration, trembling, yawning, laughing and relaxed, non-repetitive talking. In day-to-day life, these "discharging" actions may be limited by social norms, such as, for example, taboos around crying, which are widespread in many [[culture]]s.

Having temporary, undivided, supportive attention from another person often gives rise to strong feelings towards that person; your counsellor often becomes your best friend for life. Sometimes people "fall in love" with each other. This is similar to the phenomenon of [[transference]], particularly when one of the partners is felt to have more authority because, for instance, they are more experienced, are teachers of co-counselling, or have authority roles within the organisation. The organisations differ in the ways that they handle this. The inability to trust and feel in real relationships is sometimes exacerbated by the intimacy of co-counselling relationship, making transference a possibility. But participants are strongly encouraged and supported to counsel through these feelings, often leading to profound changes in their perspectives and abilities around closeness. For the most part, co-counselling relationships become life-long, therapeutic partnerships that enable the participant to have healthier relationships in general.

==Therapeutic context==
Many co-counsellors take the view, often quite strongly, that co-counselling is not psychotherapy.  In the beginning, this was because Re-evaluation Counseling decided not to draw on any discipline of psychotherapy for its theory and practice,&lt;ref&gt;Jackins, Harvey (1997); ''The list''; Rational Island, Seattle (p4, 1.019)&lt;/ref&gt; although RC did incorporate some ideas from psycho-analysis such as "unconscious promptings" which Jackins adapted and relabeled "restimulation".  A similar view is taken by some non-RC co-counsellors who regard psychotherapy as involving specialist techniques used by a therapist on a client and is therefore not peer and the client has little or no control over the process.&lt;ref&gt;Pyves, Gretchen (2000); [http://www.co-cornucopia.org.uk/coco/articles/therapy1.htm ''Co-Counseling versus Counseling''] accessed 2006-11-24&lt;/ref&gt;

Others consider that co-counselling is psychotherapeutic, in that it enables change or therapy to take place in the [[Psyche (psychology)|psyche]], [[soul]] affect or being of an individual.&lt;ref&gt;Evison, Rose &amp; Horobin, Richard  (1999); ''Co-Counseling as Therapy''; Co-Counseling Phoenix, Pitlochrie; available at [http://www.co-cornucopia.org.uk/coco/articles/cocother/index.html] accessed 2006-11-24&lt;/ref&gt; Co-counselling takes a positive view of the person (i.e. we are all essentially good), considers the mind and body as an integrated whole and acknowledges the value of catharsis; it is regarded as an approach within [[humanistic psychology]], a view that would be rejected by some within RC. &lt;ref&gt;Jackins, Harvey (1980); [https://www.rc.org/publication/books/br/br_459_hj ''The Working Class, the World, and RC''] accessed 2015-11-27&lt;/ref&gt;

==Re-evaluation Counseling==
{{Main|Re-evaluation Counseling}}

The core organization structure of RC consists of classes and local communities set up by experienced co-counsellors, which are in turn organized by regions and country.

The term "re-evaluation" refers to the client's need to rethink their past distress experiences after the [[emotion]]al hurt in those experiences have been discharged, and thereby regain ("re-emerge" with) their natural [[Intelligence|intellectual]] and emotional capacities.  The RC organization and literature do not accept the description of its practice as [[psychotherapy]], maintaining instead that the process of developing distress patterns that dissolve through emotional discharge in the context of appreciative attention is simply a natural process that does not imply either psychopathology on the part of the individual or the need for professional treatment. Re-evaluation Counseling regards other forms of "mainstream counselling" and psychotherapy in general as frequently inadequate attempts to bring about relief from distress using methods that do not focus on discharge and re-emergence.

In RC, the client and counsellor are expected to work co-operatively, participants are expected to provide non-judgmental active listening and to "contradict" the misinformation or other conditions thought to be associated with distress patterns. RC also engages techniques such as "non-permissive" counselling, in which the counsellor intervenes to "interrupt" client patterns without the consent of the client. The structure of RC is one of clearly defined leadership, to encourage clarity in the difficult struggles many people have to achieve breakthroughs against their distresses. RC encourages counsellors to think very hard about all possible ways to assist the client in discharging.

RC approaches the issue of feelings between co-counsellors by having a strict "no-socialising" rule. RC co-counsellors are expected not to socialise or have social or [[Intimate relationship|sexual relationships]] with other co-counsellors unless these [[Interpersonal relationship|relationships]] pre-dated their becoming co-counsellors.  RC specifically rejects the label "transference" for this phenomenon, as this is seen as part of a "symptomatic" method typical in [[psychology]]; the original theory of co-counselling (from RC) teaches that the best thing to do in these circumstances is repeatedly counsel on, and "discharge" about, such feelings. In addition, methods of "getting attention out of distress" are available which help with the difficulty of "switching roles" between counsellor and client. When taught correctly, counsellors are soon able to grasp the difference between counselling relationships and those from outside life. However, sometimes there is a marked pull to "socialise" or confuse the boundaries of the co-counselling relationship with other types of relationships. This is one reason why many consider a well-organised community of co-counsellors with clear rules to be essential in the successful practise of co-counselling.

Re-evaluation Counseling places a high importance on the need to understand and adhere to a comprehensive theory about the nature of the universe and of human beings (known in general as the "Benign Reality"), the best ways of assisting the discharge process and of pro-liberation attitudes in co-counselling. RCers believe that, when taken together, these enable the counsellor to keep a clear picture of the client's "re-emergence" and are therefore very effective. People disagreeing with the theoretical perspective are asked to think and discharge on the points at issue before actively challenging such perspectives. The main aim is to provide a safe, stable and supportive atmosphere within which people can client skillfully and also lead "re-emergent lives" where they are not dependent in a therapeutic sense, but instead become more energetic and effective (a state known as "zestfulness" in RC).

==Co-Counselling International==
{{Main|Co-Counselling International}}

Co-Counselling International (CCI) was started in 1974 as a breakaway from Re-evaluation Counseling by [[John Heron]], who was at the time director of the Human Potential Research Project, [[University of Surrey]] UK, and Tom Sargent and Dency Sargent from [[Hartford, Connecticut|Hartford]], [[Connecticut]], [[United States]].&lt;ref&gt;Heron, John (1998); ''Co-Counselling''; South Pacific Centre for Human Inquiry, Auckland; available at [http://www.co-cornucopia.org.uk/coco/articles/hman1fun.html]; first edition (1974); Human Potential Research Project, University of Surrey, Guildford&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike other breakaways from RC, which involved changes of leadership but otherwise continued to practice in similar ways to RC, the CCI break was ideological, and CCI developed in significantly different ways. The differences are in practice, [[theory]] and organisation.

In practice, the client in CCI co-counselling is wholly in charge of the session. In other words, client and counsellor do not work co-operatively. The counsellor only intervenes in accordance with one of three levels of "contract"—free attention, normal and intensive—which are defined in CCI's principles. The only requirement of the counsellor is that they give "free attention" (that is, full supportive attention) to the client. The other two contracts constitute invitations to the counsellor to make interventions from within those permitted if they feel it is appropriate. The intensive contract can be similar to the RC way of working, although the counsellor is still not permitted to intervene as flexibly as in RC.

The original theory of co-counselling is taught in the CCI fundamentals training courses, and participants learn techniques for releasing, or "discharging", emotions. However, the theory is not seen as a constraint within CCI, and co-counsellors draw on the whole range of [[Psychotherapy|psychotherapeutic]] theory and methods including [[Analytical psychology|analytical]], [[Cognitive psychology|cognitive]]-[[Behaviorism|behavioural]] and [[transpersonal]] as well as [[Humanistic psychology|humanistic]] approaches. The principal constraint is that the client must be able to work self-directedly.

Organisationally, CCI is a peer network with no core structure. Local and national networks have a variety of organisation. Classes and activities are organised by individuals or groups acting self-directedly. John Heron's status within the network has always been as an equal member, although inevitably as a founder member and activist for some 15 years and the person who developed much of the thinking behind CCI, there was a certain amount of transference on him. Heron now lives in [[New Zealand]] and is involved with the CCI network there.

CCI approaches the issue of personal [[Interpersonal relationship|relationships]] between co-counsellors as a matter for raising awareness. CCI co-counsellors may and do have the whole range of personal relationships with other co-counsellors. However, new co-counsellors are encouraged not to develop new non-co-counselling relationships with other co-counsellors until they have more experience and experienced co-counsellors will often have people with whom they only have a co-counselling relationship. Teachers of co-counselling are strongly discouraged from having [[Intimate relationship|sexual relationships]] with people they have taught.

==Relations between CCI and RC==
{{Disputed-section|date=March 2008}}
The existence of other co-counselling organisations is generally not mentioned in RC, and RC co-counsellors are often not aware of their existence.

Amongst those within RC who know about it, CCI is often seen as an "attack organisation" and was specifically condemned as such in many private and public conversations by Jackins, who claimed that Heron had started it against a specific agreement not to, and in breach of RC guidelines he had previously agreed to. In turn, Heron and many of his supporters claimed that RC was [[Authoritarianism|authoritarian]] and [[cult]]-like, and later, that Jackins engaged in [[sexual abuse]] of clients. RC supporters parried that CCI fostered a [[Human sexuality|sexually]]-liberal atmosphere that blurred the boundaries of co-counselling and [[Interpersonal relationship|relationships]]. 

The history of co-counselling including its origins with RC is normally taught on CCI Fundamentals courses.&lt;ref&gt;Evison, Rose &amp; Horobin, Richard (1985); ''How to Change Yourself and Your world''; Co-Counselling Phoenix, Pitlochrie; {{ISBN|1-870224-01-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;  CCI, by its nature, has no corporate opinion about RC, and individual CCI co-counsellors have their own views.  Most CCI co-counsellors have a benevolent view toward RC, regarding it as a different, alternative approach to co-counselling.  Membership of RC is not a bar to membership of CCI, and a few people manage to do both despite the RC ban.

==Other co-counselling initiatives==

In 1987, the association became The Institute for Self-Analysis, a member of the [http://plaza.ufl.edu/bjparis/ International Karen Horney Society].

'''Cyril Hubert Marie Bourlon de Rouvre''' is a [[France|French]] [[businessman]] and [[politician]], born 19 December 1945 at [[Boulogne-Billancourt]].

== Biography ==

=== Education and early career ===
Son of Évrard Bourlon de Rouvre, an industrialist, and his wife Claude Genty, Cyril Bourlon de Rouvre is the heir of sugar refineries and the landed property of his great-grandfather, Charles Bourlon de Rouvre (1850-1924), himself stepson of one of the richest men at the end of the 19th century, Gustave Lebaudy.

After studies at the ''collège Maspero'' in [[Paris]], then at the ''collège Saint-Martin de France'' in [[Pontoise]], the [[The Oratory School|Oratory School]] in [[Reading, Berkshire|Reading]], the ''Collège Saint-Jean'' in [[Fribourg]] and at the ''[[Lycée Janson-de-Sailly]]'',&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.grandprix.com/gpe/cref-dercyr.html PEOPLE: CYRIL BOURLON DE ROUVRE]&lt;/ref&gt; Cyril Bourlon de Rouvre studied [[electrical engineering]] at ''[[Jussieu Campus|Jussieu]]'' before graduating as an [[aerospace engineer]] at the ''[[Institut polytechnique des sciences avancées]]''.

He first worked at ''[[Électricité de France]]'' before serving his [[conscription]] and started his career as a sales engineer at the Elliot Automation company (1966-1968) before being Director of export of the Sucre Union company (1971-1973). He was business manager of the sales support department of the Lara audiovisual company (1973), then commercial agent in the audiovisual (1974-1975) and associate director at the Auto Racing company (1977).

=== A young and dynamic business leader ===
In 1979, upon the death of his father (who was murdered by his valet), he inherited large real estate holdings, a sugar refinery and 28 companies. He became [[Chief executive officer|CEO]] of ''Financière Robur et de Cofragec'' (1982-1992),&lt;ref&gt;{{fr icon}} [http://www.liberation.fr/france/0101180993-la-drole-de-faillite-de-cyril-de-rouvre-ancien-patron-de-ligier La drôle de faillite de Cyril de Rouvre, ancien patron de Ligier]&lt;/ref&gt; ''Coficine'' (1984-1992) and many other companies.

He modernized the sugar factory and his inheritance prospered, taking, in 1981, control of the holding Fraissinet, owner of the business airline Transair. In 1987, he started a new career in film distribution by acquiring, from the producer [[Robert Dorfmann]],&lt;ref&gt;{{fr icon}} [http://www.lexpress.fr/informations/les-millions-de-cyril_596731.html Les millions de Cyril]&lt;/ref&gt; by one of its companies, the ''Financière Robur'', Cofragec company with its catalog of 650 films including ''[[La Grande Vadrouille]]'' or ''[[La Vache et le Prisonnier]]''. He produced movies including ''[[The Bengali Night|La Nuit bengali]]'' (1988) of [[Nicolas Klotz]], ''Les Deux Fragonard'' (1989) of Philippe Le Guay, and ''[[La Peste]]'' (1992) of [[Luis Puenzo]]. He also invested in real estate, including a hotel in [[Tahiti]].

Passionate about cars and racing, he rallied with [[Thierry Sabine]], including Abidjan-Nice driving a [[Range Rover]].

=== Political life in Haute-Marne and investment in Formula 1 ===
In 1989, he started a political career in ''[[Haute-Marne]]'', a department where which his grandfather Charles de Rouvre was a deputy during the [[French Third Republic|Third Republic]]. He was elected mayor of [[Chaumont, Haute-Marne|Chaumont]], as an independent (classified as [[miscellaneous right]]) against the centrist senator and mayor Georges Berchet, and regional councilor for the [[Champagne-Ardenne]] [[Region of France|region]] (1992-1998).

He takes his team, as an alderman, a man of 25 years, [[Luc Chatel]], becoming in fact the first « political godfather ».

Owner of the [[Formula 1|Formula 1 team]] [[Automobiles Gonfaronnaises Sportives|AGS]] from March 1989 to 1991, he swallowed $ 18 million and began selling activities of his group, about 70 companies: First Transair, then the sugar factory, sold to the ''Compagnie de Navigation Mixte'', and in 1992, the catalog of movies, lent to [[UGC (cinema operator)|UGC]] in the form of a merger. In 1991, he gives AGS the Italians Gabriele Rafanelli and Patrizio Cantu.

In 1992, Cyril de Rouvre bought the [[Formula 1|Formula 1 team]] [[Equipe Ligier|Ligier]] for an estimated price of 200 million of francs. With its new owner, the team started to again be competitive - the [[1993 Formula One season|1993 season]] was a success, with a 5th place in the constructor's championship (the team's best result since 1986). But the involvement of Cyril de Rouvre lasted only one season because of legal troubles.

=== The legal troubles and the decline ===
The 14 December 1993, the judge [[Eva Joly]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.liberation.fr/economie/0101125375-cyril-de-rouvre Cyril de Rouvre]&lt;/ref&gt; incarcerated him at the [[Fleury-Mérogis Prison]], as part of a complaint for fraud filed by the leaders of UGC, Guy Verrecchia and Alain Sussfeld, following the takeover in June 1992 the company Cofragec. This company has been emptied of its assets, leaving a liability estimated at 172.6 million francs. Cyril de Rouvre had promised to repay this sum at the end of 1992 but at that time, he still had 100 million. On 5 May 1993, leaders of UGC have filed a complaint against him. He spent two months in prison.

In early 1994, he sold [[Equipe Ligier|Ligier]] to [[Flavio Briatore]].

He lost the mayoralty of Chaumont at the [[French municipal elections, 1995|French municipal elections of 1995]].

In 1996, a judicial investigation was opened against him at the ''Tribunal de grande instance'' of Chaumont. He appeared before the Criminal Court of this city in September 1999 for tax evasion. Knowing that the prosecution had requested a sentence of three years imprisonment and a 20-year ban on company management, he was sentenced on 19 December 1999, his birthday, to a [[suspended sentence]] of 18 months imprisonment' a ban from managing a company for 3 years, and a large fine.

The '''Financial District''' of [[Boston]] is located in [[Downtown Boston]], near [[Government Center, Boston|Government Center]] and [[Chinatown, Boston|Chinatown]].

Like many areas within Boston, the Financial District has no official definition.  It is roughly bounded by [[Atlantic Avenue (Boston)|Atlantic Avenue]], State Street, and Devonshire Street.  Parts of the Financial District are in various [[United States Postal Service|USPS]] postal [[ZIP Code]]s, including 02108, 02109, 02110, and 02111.

==Landmarks==
The area includes [[Post Office Square, Boston, Massachusetts|Post Office Square]], the [[Exchange Place (Boston)|Exchange Place]] and [[International Place]] complexes, and the landmark [[Custom House Tower]] (now an 87-room Marriott Vacation Club), and borders [[Quincy Market]] and [[Faneuil Hall]].

===Key companies===
[[Image:FinancialDistrict.jpg|right|thumb|222px|[[125 High Street]], [[One International Place]], and the [[Flag of Massachusetts]] in the Financial District near [[South Station]]]]
[[File:USA-Financial District (3).JPG|thumb|right|One Financial Center and nearby buildings]]
The Financial District also contains the headquarters of the mutual fund companies [[Fidelity Investments]], [[Putnam Investments]], and DWS Scudder Investments; the world headquarters for [[State Street Corporation|State Street Bank]] and [[Eastern Bank]]; accounting firms Wolf &amp; Company, P.C., [[RSM McGladrey]], and [[BDO USA, LLP]]; loan advisor [[The Debt Exchange]]; the law firms of [[Bingham McCutchen]], [[Goodwin Procter]], [[WilmerHale]], [[Kirkpatrick &amp; Lockhart Nicholson Graham]], and [[Mintz, Levin, Cohn, Ferris, Glovsky, and Popeo, PC]]; the local headquarters of [[Bank of America]] (formerly [[FleetBoston Financial|Fleet Bank]]) and [[Sovereign Bank]]; the [[Langham Hotel Boston]] and [[Hilton Hotels|Hilton]] Hotel; and the local offices of [[Merrill Lynch]] and other brokerages.

===Notable buildings===
[[Dewey Square]], [[One Financial Center]], and the plaza and towers housing the [[Federal Reserve Bank of Boston]] are located near [[South Station]], adjacent to and just south of the area defined above.  Also part of the Financial District are [[33 Arch Street]], [[One Federal Street]], the [[First National Bank Building (Boston)|First National Bank Building]], [[100 Summer Street]], and [[101 Federal Street]]. The area contains many of Boston's highrise buildings in a fairly densely packed area, significantly more than the [[Back Bay]] which contains Boston's two tallest highrises, the [[Prudential Tower]] and [[200 Clarendon Street]].

===Recent development===
There has been some recent development and construction in the area. [[Russia Wharf]] was recently completed along the Fort Channel and rises up to 395 feet and 32 stories. Construction of [[South Station Tower]] was scheduled to begin in 2009 but has been put on hold. If completed the tower would rise to 621 feet and 41 stories.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.boston.com/business/ticker/2006/06/city_approves_4.html |title=City approves 40-story South Station tower

It featured singers [[Raquel]], '''Taurian Devueax''' and '''Yolanda Chioma Richards-Albert'''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.talkmediaghana.com/tmgexclusive-mixtape-ian-jazzi-in-stereo-volume-ii-turn-the-volume-up-hosted-by-dj-black/ |title=#TMGExclusive [Mixtape&amp;#93; Ian Jazzi – In Stereo Volume II – Turn The Volume Up (Hosted By DJ Black) |publisher=TalkMediaGhana.com |date=3 July 2013 |accessdate=1 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 2010, Ian Jazzi released his second mixtape, ''Ian Jazzi on the Heartbeats &amp; Other Freestyles''.&lt;ref name="ghanamixtapes1"&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=http://ghanamixtapes.com/2010/10/ian-jazzi-on-the-heartbeats-other-freestyles/ |title=Ian Jazzi – On the heartbeats &amp; Other Freestyles &amp;#124; Ghana MixtapesGhana Mixtapes |publisher=Ghanamixtapes.com |date= |accessdate=1 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; This mixtape primarily featured Ian Jazzi freestyling over beats by renowned Ghanaian producer Jayso. It was a remix of hits produced for artists like [[Sarkodie (rapper)|Sarkodie]], [[Sway DaSafo]], [[R2Bees]], and '''Kwaw Kesse'''. The purpose of the mixtape was to showcase Jazzi's versatile rap skills over more commercial beats; his poetic style, like his lyrical style, is primarily socially conscious, integrating elements of inspiration and spirituality.&lt;ref name="modernghana1"/&gt;

In October 2010, Jazzi turned his attention to his new company, The Unwind Agency, completing several model and advertising related contracts for companies such as '''TIGO''', [[Ecobank]], Coca-Cola, Brand Communications, Ramel International, Ghana's Gas Forum, Kingdom Africa Management, and MMRS Ogilvy. In addition he also released several singles on the side, featuring artists like [[EL (rapper)|EL]], [[Trigmatic]], radio/TV personality Jay Foley, Senam E.Twin Gbeho, and Radio Jock/rapper J.O.E.L. In the latter part of 2010 he collaborated with his friend [[Elom Adablah|EL]] and released "Envy".&lt;ref name="youtube1"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xrqq3TrBuzM |title=Envy – Ian Jazzi ft.

EL – Envy(Official Video) |publisher=YouTube |date=30 April 2012 |accessdate=1 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; in March 2011.

In August 2013, Ian Jazzi released the 32 track ''In Stereo Volume II – Turn The Volume Up'' mixtape,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=http://ghanamixtapes.com/2013/07/ian-jazzi-in-stereo-vol-2-turn-the-volume-up/ |title=Ian Jazzi – In Stereo Vol.2 Turn The Volume Up &amp;#124; Ghana MixtapesGhana Mixtapes |publisher=Ghanamixtapes.com |date= |accessdate=1 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; which featured Multi-Platinum Producer Coptic, rappers, Psalm 1, the Christ Junkie and D.E.M.

Acting career

While in High School, Jazzi was vice-president of the Drama club and was involved in most of the schools theatre productions. At the University of Ghana, he played Duncan in Shakespeare's Macbeth, and the role of Jerry in Harold Pinters 'Betrayal', among others.

===Television===
In 2008, Ian Jazzi hosted the NT1 poetry show on TV Africa,&lt;ref&gt;{{YouTube|ixBZP2Ek5BU}}&lt;/ref&gt; a studio recording of poets performing the  spoken word, which lasted for a single season of 16 episodes. In 2010, Jazzi was contracted by Rite Multimedia,&lt;ref&gt;ritemultimedia.com&lt;/ref&gt; to host ''Basket Ball TV'', also on TV Africa.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.basketballghana.com/basketball-tv|title=Basketball TV - Basket Ball Ghana|work=Basket Ball Ghana|access-date=2018-04-23|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; The show covered the ongoing inter-community basketball competition held at Elwak Stadium, and was usually transmitted live from the stadium.

Also in 2010, Jazzi played the role of a playboy in ''Desperation'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ghanaweb.com/GhanaHomePage/entertainment/artikel.php?ID=226200 |title=Nominees For Ghana Movie Awards Public Voting Categories Released &amp;#124; Movies 22 December 2011 |publisher=Ghanaweb.com |date= |accessdate=1 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; a romantic-comedy television series, directed by Dickson Dzapasu, which aired night-time in Ghana and Nigeria. In 2012, he played the role of a rich and arrogant youth who got into trouble in the investigative TV series, ''Peep'',&lt;ref name="Re-elAfrican"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://reelafrican.com/peep-1/ |title=ReelAfrican |publisher=ReelAfrican |date=18 January 2013 |accessdate=1 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Peep &amp;#124; Africa Magic"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://africamagic.dstv.com/tag/peep/ |title=Peep &amp;#124; Africa Magic |publisher=Africamagic.dstv.com |date= |accessdate=1 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; which was produced and directed by [[Shirley Frimpong-Manso|Shirley Frimpong Manso]].

      <comment>/* Payment for IRU */ converting to reference</comment>
      <model>wikitext</model>
      <format>text/x-wiki</format>
      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6212">'''Indefeasible right of use''' (IRU) is a permanent [[contract]]ual agreement, that cannot be undone, between the owners of a communications system and a customer of that system. The word "indefeasible" means "not capable of being annulled, or voided, or undone." The customer purchases the right to use a certain amount of the capacity of the system, for a specified number of years. IRU contracts are almost always long term, commonly lasting 20 to 30 years. The communication system can be a wire cable, such as [[submarine communications cable]], or a fiber optic cable, or a satellite. Depending on the type of system the customer might be buying exclusive use of one, or more, wires in a wire cable, fibers in a fiber optic cable, or channels through a satellite.  An IRU owner can unconditionally and exclusively use the relevant capacity of the IRU grantor’s network for the specified time period.

These contracts obligate the purchaser to pay a portion of the operating costs, and the costs of maintaining the cable, including any costs incurred repairing the cable after mishaps. The right of use is indefeasible, so the capacity purchased is also nonreturnable, and maintenance costs incurred become payable and irrefusable.

==Definition of IRU==

The IRU "shall mean the exclusive, unrestricted, and indefeasible right to use the relevant capacity (including equipment, fibers or capacity) for any legal purpose."&lt;ref&gt;http://contracts.corporate.findlaw.com/agreements/athome/att.iru.1998.12.19.html&lt;/ref&gt; It refers to the [[Bandwidth (computing)|bandwidth]] purchased after, for example, a submarine cable system has been sealed at the end of construction, and to the maintenance agreement (C&amp;MA) among the owners. It is a way for the owners to capitalize the unused capacity or any unowned capacity, after the system comes into service.

In plainer English, the purchase of an IRU gives the purchaser the right to use some capacity on a telecommunications cable system, including the right to lease that capacity to someone else.  Smaller companies that need a leased line between, say, London and New York do not buy an IRU – they lease capacity from a telecommunications company that themselves may lease a larger amount of capacity from another company (and so on), until at the end of the chain of contracts there is a company that has an IRU, or wholly owns a cable system.

''(extract from WSJ)'' Pioneered decades ago by AT&amp;T, IRUs allowed competitors to gain access to the costly undersea cables that only AT&amp;T could afford to build. There remains some controversy over booking IRUs as assets in an asset-swap transaction between companies. Since IRU's are technically rights to a physical part of a cable, they can be considered an asset, which means their cost isn't part of the company's operating results, but shows up under [[Fixed asset|tangible assets]].  The IRU is counted as though it is a part of the physical plant of the business buying the IRU.

== Dark Fiber IRU ==

The [[Dark fibre|Dark fiber]] (DF) IRU "shall mean the exclusive, unrestricted, and indefeasible right to use one, a pair, or more strands of fiber of a fiber cable for any legal purpose." With an IRU contractual arrangement the buyer of the IRU can unconditionally, and exclusively, use the fibers of the IRU for a long time period.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://its.ucsc.edu/core_tech/projects/dark_fiber/frequentlyaskedquestionsaboutdarkfiber.doc |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-06-24 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100703223637/http://its.ucsc.edu/core_tech/projects/dark_fiber/frequentlyaskedquestionsaboutdarkfiber.doc |archivedate=2010-07-03 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In this case [[dark fiber]] is called "dark" since it has to be lit by the IRU owner, not the cable's owner.

The wholesale purchase of dark fiber has normally been accomplished by means of IRUs. Fiber cable owners do not normally sell their fiber but offer IRUs for up to 20 years for unrestricted use. 10 to 25 years corresponds to a typical lifetime of the [[Optical fiber cable]] systems. The up-front cost for the purchase of a 20-year IRU can be a one-time investment. It will normally be associated with ongoing obligations for shared maintenance. Usually, the IRU can be considered to be a physical asset, which can be resold, traded or used as collateral.

For regulatory reasons, generally only licensed carriers are allowed access to support structures, and to municipal rights of way.

The IRU contract defines detailed technical and performance specifications for the IRU fibers. More specifically, it includes dark fiber acceptance and testing procedures, the description of the dark fiber physical route, operating specifications for the dark fiber infrastructure, performance specifications ([[attenuation]], [[Dispersion (optics)|Chromatic Dispersion]], [[Polarization Mode Dispersion]], [[Return loss|Optical Return Loss]]), maintenance and restoration terms. These terms must be valid for the full duration of the IRU contract. Moreover, it includes specific actions and procedures in cases of changes on the IRU grantor’s fiber network, degradation of fiber performance etc.

== Payment for IRU ==

* A lump sum payment corresponding to the DF construction cost and the use of the DF infrastructure for the IRU duration. This payment usually accounts for the greatest part of the IRU budget.
* A periodic (e.g. annual) fee corresponding to the maintenance services provided to IRU user by the IRU grantor. This is usually fixed or slightly increasing, taking into account a country’s inflation.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.porta-optica.org/publications/POS-D3.2_Economical_analysis.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10394">'''Information Logistics''' (IL) deals with the flow of information between human and / or machine actors within or between any number of organizations that in turn form a value creating network (see, e.g.&lt;ref&gt;Hafter, D.; Kajtazi, M.: [http://lnu.diva-portal.org/smash/get/diva2:344139/FULLTEXT01 ''What is Information Logistics''], 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;). IL is closely related to [[information management]], [[information operations]] and [[information technology]].

== Definition ==
The term ''Information Logistics (IL)'' may be used in either of two ways:
# Firstly, it can be defined as "managing and controlling information handling processes optimally with respect to time (flow time and capacity), storage, distribution and presentation in such a way that it contributes to company results in concurrence with the costs of capturing (creation, searching, maintenance etc)." (Reference is missing!!!) Thus IL utilizes logistic principles to optimize information handling. 
# Secondly, IL can be seen as a concept using information technology to optimize logistics. 

A term which is closely related to the first meaning of Information Logistics is  ''Data Logistics''&lt;ref&gt;Beck, M.; Moore, T.; Plank, J.; Swany, M.:"Logistical Networking", Active Middleware Services, pp. 141-154. Springer US, 2000&lt;/ref&gt;, a concept used in [[Computer Networking]]. 
"The study of solutions to problems in Computer Systems that flexibly span resources and services relating to Data Movement, Data Storage and Data Processing." [ref?]
Systems that support general Data Logistics solutions thus must span the traditionally separate fields of Networking, File/Database Systems and Process Management.
Data Logistics is a more general form of the term ''Logistical Networking'', used as the name of a particular network storage architecture and software stack.&lt;ref&gt; Plank, J.S.; Beck, M.; Elwasif, W.R.; Moore, T.; Swany, M. Wolski, R.: [http://loci.cs.utk.edu/dsi/netstore99/docs/papers/plank.pdf The Internet Backplane Protocol: Storage in the Network]", http://loci.cs.utk.edu/dsi/netstore99/ Network Storage Symposium], October 14 &amp; 15, 1999; Seattle, Washington.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Plank, J.S.; Bassi ,A.; Beck, M.; Moore. T.; Swany, D.M.; Wolski, R.: "[https://www.researchgate.net/publication/3419419_Managing_Data_Storage_in_the_Network?enrichId=rgreq-3d4486adc18ed37f4317d890c31fe241-XXX&amp;enrichSource=Y292ZXJQYWdlOzM0MTk0MTk7QVM6MTAxNjg5MDUwNzk2MDUwQDE0MDEyNTU5Njc4ODU%3D&amp;el=1_x_2&amp;_esc=publicationCoverPdf Managing Data Storage in the Network]", IEEE Internet Computing, vol. 5, no. 5, pp 50-58, Sept/Oct 2001, &lt;/ref&gt;

== Goal ==
The goal of Information Logistics is to deliver the right product, consisting of the right information element, in the right format, at the right place at the right time for the right people at the right price and all of  this is  customer [[demand]] driven.
If this goal is to be achieved, [[knowledge workers]] are best equipped with information for the task at hand for improved interaction with its customers and machines are enabled to respond automatically to meaningful information.  

Methods for achieving the goal are:

* the analysis of information demand
* intelligent information storage
* the optimization of the flow of information
* securing technical and organizational flexibility
* integrated information and billing solutions &lt;ref&gt;Uckelmann, D.: ''Quantifying the Value of RFID and the EPCglobal Architecture Framework in Logistics'', Springer, Berlin 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

The expression was formed by the Indian mathematician and librarian [[S. R. Ranganathan]] (Reference is missing!!!).

The supply of a product is part of the discipline [[Logistics]]. The purpose of this discipline is described as follows:

[[Logistics]] is the teachings of the plans and the [[effective]] and [[efficiency|efficient]] run of supply. The contemporary logistics focuses on the organization, planning, control and implementation of the flow of goods, [[money]], [[information]] and flow of people. 

Information Logistics focusses on [[information]]. Information (from Latin informare: "shape, shapes, instruct") means in a general sense everything that adds [[knowledge]] and thus reduce ignorance or lack of precision. In stricter sense information becomes information only to those who can interpret it. Interpreting information will provide knowledge.

==Information Element==
An '''Information Element''' (IE) is an information component that is located in the organizational [[value chain]]. 
The combination of certain IEs leads to an information product (IP), which is any final product in the form of information that a person needs to have. 
When a higher number of different IEs are required, it often results in more planning problems in capacity and inherently leads to a non-delivery of the IP. 

To illustrate the concept of an IP, an example is shown of a bottleneck analysis in HR (by J. Willems 2008). Here, the illustration shows how the information elements (e.g. qualifications) build up the information product (e.g. HR file).

[[File:Bottleneck analysis.png]]

==Data Logistics==
Data Logistics is a concept that developed independently of Information Logistics in the 1990s, in response to the explosion of Internet content and traffic due to the invention of the [[World Wide Web]] (WWW). 
Some motivations for the emergence of interest in Data Logistics included:

*The incorporation of network [[Hyperlink|hyperlinks]] into content encoded in [[HTML]] encouraged  users to freely dereference those links without regard to, or in many cases without even having any knowledge of, the identity (much less the [[Geography|geographical]] or [[Network topology|network topological]] location of) the target [[Web Server|Web server]].
The growth in the volume of [[Web Hits|Web hits]], combined with the steady increase in the size of Web-delivered objects such as images, audio and video clips resulted in the localized overloading of the [[bandwidth (computing)|bandwidth]] and [[process management (computing)|processing]] resources of the [[Local network|local]] and/or [[Wide area network|wide area]] network and/or the [[Web server]] infrastructure.
The resulting [[Internet bottleneck]] can cause Web clients to experience poor performance or complete denial of access to servers that host high volume sites (the so-called [[Slashdot effect]]).
*The growth in all Internet traffic, especially across international telecommunication links, resulted in stress to institutional infrastructure and high costs on networks that billed Internet traffic on a per-use basis.
*Much of this traffic was redundant, the results of repeated requests by many independent users to access the same stored files and content.
* Large files and content retrieved from distant [[Web server|Web servers]] was often delayed due to high delays experienced over long and complex Internet paths.

These factors led to interest in the use of large scale storage (and to a lesser extent, processing) resources to cache the response to network requests, first at the Internet endpoint using a [[Web browser cache]] and later at intermediate network locations using shared network caches.
This line of development also gave rise to Web server replication and other techniques for offloading and distributing the work of delivering large volume Web services to widely dispersed client communities, ultimately resulting in the creation of modern [[Content delivery network|Content delivery networks]].

At the same time, research efforts in server replication and content delivery gave rise to a number of related projects and strategies, including Logistical Networking (LN).
The name LN was intended as an analogy to physical supply chain logistics, in which goods are not only carried from source to destination on networks of roads, but are also stored at warehouses located throughout the transportation infrastructure.
This led to a nomenclature in which LN network storage resources are termed "storage depots".
The principles that underpin LN have been abstracted into the more general study of scheduling and optimization across the traditional infrastructure silos of Storage, Networking and Processing which was named Data Logistics.

'''Illustrative Examples of Data Logistics:'''
* Data Caching and Replication are classic examples of Data Logistics solutions to problems in Computer Systems and Networking with high data access latencies or data transfer resource limitations. It works mainly across the areas of data transfer and data storage.
*Dynamic Compression in data transfer is another example which uses computational resources to minimize the bandwidth requirements of data transfer.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4112">'''Intopia''' (or '''INTOPIA''') is a [[strategic management]] [[simulation]] tool in the form of a [[business game]], and is used in a variety of undergraduate and graduate university courses. It is used to teach students the concepts of strategic management of multinational businesses in a simulated world of up to four "nations".  The number of participant executives or students can range from 9 to 100+, and are divided into 3−25 teams, each managing a company.  The participants practice their skills over a few hours, receiving immediate feedback on their decisions.

Intopia has been used as a tool in teaching [[business strategy]] in universities in over 55 countries around the world, including 18 in the U.S.  A positive 1995 review by Peter Palij of Columbia University concluded that the tool is "a benchmark for measuring other competitive simulations".&lt;ref name=Palij&gt;{{cite journal| title=INTOPIA: International Operations Simulation/Mark 2000| author= Peter Palij| journal=Simulation &amp; Gaming"| year=1995|volume= 26| issue=4| pages=524-7| doi=10.1177/1046878195264014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

Development of management simulation software began at the [[University of Chicago]] in the early days of academic computing.  This work led by  Hans B. Thorelli and Robert L. Graves resulted in the release in 1963 of the tool INTOP, which was employed for teaching in over 160 institutions world-wide over the period 1963-1995.

The modern tool INTOPIA was first released in 1995, after a development by an international team over a period of approximately seven years. The team included Thorelli (coordinator, presently Distinguished Professor Em. in the Kelley School of Business, Indiana University), Graves (then Prof. of Mathematics and Computers in the School of Business, University of Chicago), and Juan-Claudio Lopez (Professor in Escuela de Administracion, Universidad Catolica, Santiago de Chile).  The company Intopia, Inc. was registered in the State of Indiana, USA, in the mid-90s to further develop and manage the simulation.  The present version of INTOPIA B2B was developed by Thorelli, Graves and Scott McDaniel of Personix (Indianapolis, Indiana).  Thorelli's work with the simulation is being carried on by his son, Tom, and grandson, Erik Thorelli.&lt;ref name=intopia&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.intopiainc.com| title=Intopia Inc.| accessdate=5 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Key features==

Intopia is an imaginary [[world]] of four [[regions]], with a maximum of four [[currencies]]. The world has multiple competing [[firm]]s which may produce a maximum of two types of [[product (business)|product]]s of varying types. These products fall into two distinct categories of consumer durables – X's and Y's, although those X's and Y's may represent different products within each simulation.

Each company is required to make decisions regarding the current and future periods. A company's unilateral decision can range from introducing new products, performing R&amp;D, stepping up production, initiating market research, setting prices and sales/promotions for its products. As well, there is a great amount of inter-company business, with each company able to purchase or sell to other companies.

As well as the production of X's and Y's, companies may choose to sell insurance, provide financial or analytical services, or license new products to gain revenue.

Each decision affects the bottom line of the company which is reflected at the end of the period, after the simulation has run.

[[File:Jacques Coeur, by follower of Jean Fouquet.jpg|thumb|Jacques Coeur (follower of [[Jean Fouquet]], 15th century)]]

'''Jacques Cœur''' ({{IPAc-en|k|ɜr}};&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.collinsdictionary.com/dictionary/english/coeur "Coeur"]. ''[[Collins English Dictionary]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; {{IPA-fr|kœʁ|lang}}; {{circa|lk=no|1395}} in [[Bourges]] – 25 November 1456 in [[Chios]]), was a French merchant, one of the founders of the trade between [[France]] and the [[Levant]].

== Origins ==
[[File:Jacques Coeur maison natale.JPG|thumb|200px|Jacques Cœur's first home]]
He was born at [[Bourges]], the city where his father, Pierre Cœur, was a rich merchant. Jacques is first heard of around 1418, when he married Macée de Léodepart, daughter of Lambert de Léodepart, an influential citizen, provost of Bourges and a former [[valet]] of [[John, Duke of Berry]].

== Early career ==
About 1429 he formed a commercial partnership with two brothers named Godard; and in 1432 he was at [[Damascus]], buying and [[barter]]ing, and transporting the wares of the Levant&amp;mdash;[[gall|gall-nut]]s, [[wool]]s and [[silk]]s, [[mohair]], [[brocade]]s and [[carpet]]s&amp;mdash;to the interior of France by way of [[Narbonne]]. In the same year he established himself at [[Montpellier]], and there began the gigantic operations which have made him illustrious among financiers. Details are wanting; but it is certain that in a few years he placed his country in a position to contend fairly well with the great trading republics of [[Italy]], and acquired such a reputation as to be able, mere trader as he was, to render material assistance to the knights of [[Rhodes]] and to [[Venice]] itself.

== Later life ==
In 1436, Cœur was summoned to Paris by [[Charles VII of France|Charles VII]], and made master of the mint. This post was of great importance, and the duties onerous. The country was deluged with base monies from three reigns, charged with superscriptions both French and English, and Charles was determined to make sweeping reforms. In this design he was ably seconded by the merchant, who, in fact, inspired or prepared all the ordinances concerning the coinage of France issued between 1435 and 1451. In 1438, he was made steward of the royal expenditure; in 1441 he and his family were ennobled by letters patent. In 1444, he was sent as one of the royal commissioners to preside over the new parliament of [[Languedoc]] in [[Pézenas]], where his house can still be seen, a position he held until the day of his disgrace. In 1445, his agents in the East negotiated a treaty between the sultan of [[Egypt]] and the knights of Rhodes; and in 1447, at his insistence, Jean de Village, his nephew by marriage, was charged with a mission to Egypt. The results were most important; concessions were obtained which greatly improved the position of the French consuls in the Levant, and that influence in the East was thereby founded which, though often interrupted, was for several centuries a major commercial glory for France. In the same year, Cœur assisted in an embassy to [[Amadeus VIII]], former [[Duke of Savoy]], who had been chosen Pope as [[Felix V]] by the [[council of Basel]] and in 1448 he represented the French king at the court of [[Pope Nicholas V]] where he was able to arrange an agreement between Nicholas and Amadeus, and so end the papal schism. Nicholas treated him with the utmost distinction, lodged him in the papal palace, and gave him special licence to traffic with the infidels. From about this time he made advances to Charles to carry on his wars and in 1449, after fighting at the King's side throughout the campaign, he entered [[Rouen]] in Charles' triumphal procession.

At this point, the great trader's glory was at its height. He had represented France in three embassies, and had supplied the sinews of the war which had ousted the English from [[Normandy]]. He was invested with various offices of state, and possessed the most colossal fortune that had ever been amassed by a private Frenchman. The sea was covered with his ships; he had 300 managers in his employ, and business houses in all the chief cities of France. He had built houses and chapels, and had founded colleges in [[Paris]], Montpellier and Bourges. The house in Bourges was exceptionally magnificent and remains today one of the finest monuments of the Middle Ages in France. He also built there the sacristy of the cathedral and a sepulchral chapel for his family. His brother Nicholas Cœur was made [[Bishop of Lyon]], his sister married Jean Bochetel, the King's secretary, his daughter married the son of the Viscount of Bourges, and his son Jean Cœur became [[Archbishop of Bourges]]. But Cœur's huge monopoly caused his ruin. Dealing in everything: money and arms, furs and jewels, brocades and wool, a broker, a banker, a farmer, he had absorbed the trade of the country, and merchants complained they could make no profit because of him. He had lent money to needy courtiers, to members of the royal family, and to the King himself, and his debtors, jealous of his wealth, were eager for a chance to cause his downfall.

== Silversmith and alchemist ==
Jacques Cœur is mentioned by Fulcanelli in ''Le Mystère des Cathédrales'' (1926) where the "master alchemist" speculates that Cœur was a successful alchemist or associated with alchemists and that he was a silversmith in the literal sense, i.e. that he could transmute base metals into small quantities of silver.

== Downfall ==
In February 1450 [[Agnès Sorel]], the King's mistress, suddenly died. Eighteen months later it was rumoured that she had been poisoned, and a lady of the court who owed money to Jacques Cœur, Jeanne de Vendôme, wife of François de Montberon, and an Italian, Jacques Colonna, formally accused him of having poisoned her. There was no pretext for such a charge, but for this and other alleged crimes the King, on 31 July 1451, gave orders for his arrest and for the seizure of his goods, reserving for himself a large sum of money for the war in [[Guienne]]. Commissioners extraordinary, the merchant's declared enemies, were chosen to conduct the trial and an inquiry began, the judges in which were either the prisoner's debtors or the holders of his forfeited estates. He was accused of having paid French gold and ingots to the infidels, of coining light money, of kidnapping oarsmen for his galleys, of sending back a Christian slave who had taken sanctuary on board one of his ships, and of committing frauds and exactions in Languedoc to the King's prejudice. He defended himself with all the energy of his nature. His innocence was manifest but a conviction was necessary, and in spite of strenuous efforts on the part of his friends, after twenty-two months of confinement in five prisons, he was condemned to do public penance for his fault, to pay the King a sum equal to about 1,000,000 at today's value, and to remain a prisoner till full satisfaction had been obtained. His sentence also included confiscation of all his property, and exile during His Majesty's pleasure.

On 5 June 1453 the sentence took effect. At [[Poitiers]], the shame of making honourable amends was accomplished and for nearly three years nothing is known of him. It is probable that he remained in prison. It is certain that his vast possessions were distributed among the intimates of Charles.

== Escape and restoration ==
[[File:Jacques Coeur tête.JPG|thumb|200px|Statue of Jacques Cœur in Bourges]]
In 1455 Jacques Cœur, wherever he was confined, contrived to escape into [[Provence]]. He was pursued, but a party headed by Jean de Village and two of his old managers, carried him off to [[Tarascon]], whence, by way of [[Marseilles]], [[Nice]] and [[Pisa]], he managed to reach [[Rome]]. He was honorably and joyfully received by Nicholas V, who was fitting out an expedition against the Turks. On the death of Nicholas, [[Calixtus III]] continued his work, and made his guest, Cœur, captain of a fleet of sixteen galleys sent to the relief of Rhodes. Cœur set out on this expedition, but was taken ill at [[Chios]], and died there on 25 November 1456. After his death Charles VII showed himself well disposed to the family, and allowed Jacques Cœur's sons to inherit whatever was left of their father's wealth.

[[François Villon]], in his "Épitaphe", refers to Cœur's wealth:
&lt;poem&gt;
''De pauvreté me guermantant,
Souventes fois me dit le cœur :
"Homme, ne te doulouse tant
Et ne démène tel douleur:
Si tu n'as tant qu'eut Jacques Cœur,
Mieux vaux vivre sous gros bureau
Pauvre, qu'avoir été seigneur
Et pourrir sous riche tombeau."'' 
&lt;/poem&gt;

&lt;poem&gt;
''To ease my poverty,
my heart sometimes says to me:
"Don't fret so 
and go crazy with pain:
If you haven't as much as Jacques Cœur,
it's better to live in your coarse burrel,
poor, than to have been lord
and rot in your rich tomb."''
&lt;/poem&gt;

'''Jeffrey Thomas DeGraff''' (born 1958) is an American professor, professional speaker, author, and consultant. He is known for his contribution and development work on the ''Competing Values Framework'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://competingvalues.com/competingvalues.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/07/Competing-Values-Leadership-Media-Kit.pdf |title=Leadership : Creating Values in Organizations : Executive Summary |publisher=Competingvalues.com |accessdate=2013-10-28 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131029221237/http://competingvalues.com/competingvalues.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/07/Competing-Values-Leadership-Media-Kit.pdf# |archive-date=2013-10-29 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; a model about understanding how to appreciate conflicting values and integrate them successfully so that an organization is open to collaboration and growth. He is a consultant to executive teams at [[Fortune 500]] companies, assessing the company’s capabilities around innovation and their prospects of growing the business. DeGraff is also a professor at the Ross School of Business at the [[University of Michigan]], where he teaches undergraduate, MBA, and executive MBA classes on innovation, as well as numerous executive education classes on competency and culture development, practices and methods, and leadership.

==Early life==
DeGraff was born in [[Kalamazoo, Michigan]], United States, the second of five children. He holds a B. S. in Communication Arts and Sciences and a teaching certificate from Western Michigan University (1980), an M.A. in Communication and Information Studies from the [[University of Michigan]] (1982, Lloyd Hall Fellowship), and a Ph.D. in Educational Technology from the University of Wisconsin-Madison (1985).

==Career==
Rejoining the faculty at the Ross School of Business at the University of Michigan, DeGraff was the Vice President of Communications and New Ventures for [[Domino's Pizza]] (1985-1990). The youngest member of the executive team at twenty-six years old, DeGraff’s work focused on innovation and strategies to help Domino’s Pizza's considerable and notable growth during the 1980s. It was at Domino’s Pizza that DeGraff received the unofficial title of “Dean of Innovation.”

After five years at Domino’s Pizza, Professor Robert Quinn recruited DeGraff to join the faculty at the Ross School of Business at the University of Michigan to develop and teach a series of graduate courses on leading creativity and innovation. Today he is a top rated Professor of Management and Organizations for the school, having received the University of Michigan’s 2011 Voices of the Staff award.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://hr.umich.edu/voices/awards/ |title=University of Michigan Voices of the Staff |publisher=Hr.umich.edu |date= |accessdate=2012-08-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Also in 1990, DeGraff began working with Robert Quinn, one of the creators of the Competing Values Framework, becoming a managing partner of the firm Competing Values, LLC. DeGraff collaborated with Quinn and Kim Cameron and applied the Competing Values Framework model to business innovation and value creation as a methodology that integrates strategy, finance, innovation development, and human resource management disciplines. Using this model, DeGraff began consulting to Fortune 500 companies, helping them build custom innovation processes and working with them through their specific business challenges.

In 2009, DeGraff founded the ''Innovatrium Institute for Innovation'' with labs in Ann Arbor, Michigan and Atlanta, Georgia. Innovatrium is an innovation partnership between Haworth Inc.,&lt;ref&gt;[http://web-archive-sources.org/repository/june14/SD-Innovatrium_Brochure.pdf] {{dead link|date=October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; top universities and top firms to develop new practices for leading innovation, to connect public and private organizations, and to bring experts, practitioners, university professors, and students together to solve real world problems.

In June 2011, DeGraff hosted a national PBS television show about leading innovation, called ''Innovation You''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oXtDR3qTWM4 |title=Jeff DeGraff talks about INNOVATION YOU |publisher=YouTube |date=2011-06-08 |accessdate=2012-08-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.freep.com/article/20110612/COL07/106120426/Susan-Tompor-Lessons-from-an-innovation-guru |title=Susan Tompor: Lessons from an innovation guru &amp;#124; Susan Tompor &amp;#124; Detroit Free Press |publisher=freep.com |date= |accessdate=2012-08-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

DeGraff is the author of the book Innovation You: Four Steps to Becoming New and Improved (Ballantine Books, July 2011), and the co-author of the books Competing Values Leadership: Creating Value in Organizations (Edward Elgar Publishing, September 2007), Leading Innovation: How to Jumpstart Your Company’s Growth Engine (McGraw Hill, August 2006), and Creativity at Work: Developing the Right Practices to Make Innovation Happen (Jossey-Bass, August 2002). Additionally, DeGraff writes a syndicated blog for Psychology Today and the Huffington Post.

{{Italic title}}
'''''Losing My Virginity: The Autobiography''''' is the [[autobiography]] of the British businessman [[Richard Branson]]. Published in 1998, it was later followed by other biographical books by Branson, including ''Business Stripped Bare: Adventures of a Global Entrepreneur'' (2008) and ''The Virgin Way: How to Listen, Learn, Laugh and Lead'' (2014).

A [[paperback]] version ({{ISBN|0-7535-1020-0}}) was released in 2002.

An updated edition was released in 2005 in hardback and paperback expressing Branson's views on [[9/11]] and how it has affected his business, especially his airline [[Virgin Atlantic]].

''Losing My Virginity'' was positively reviewed by Tom Fawcett writing for [[CNN]] in 1999. Fawcett wrote that "...Branson offers a fascinating autobiography of a man who succeeded by taking huge risks, proving that the established way is not the only way." and that "The strength of ''Losing my Virginity'' is Branson's modesty and honesty. ...Often criticized by the media for being a showman, Branson reasons that he only used his personality to help gain exposure for Virgin. Surprisingly, Branson comes off as a lovable underdog battling the establishment, instead of a spoiled tycoon. In the introduction, Branson explains that "Losing My Virginity" is Volume One of his autobiography, which takes him up to his early 40s. How Branson will reinvent middle-age and retirement should make for a compelling sequel".&lt;ref name="CNN"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://edition.cnn.com/books/reviews/9903/04/losing.virginity/|title=Strength of 'Virginity' is Branson's modesty, honesty|publisher=[[CNN]]|author=Tom Faucett|accessdate=April 22, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The book was serialized in ''[[The Sun (United Kingdom)|The Sun]]'' and ''[[The Times]]''.&lt;ref name="GuardOct00"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/business/2000/oct/15/observerbusiness|title=Who holds the reins of power in Britain?|publisher=[[The Guardian]]|accessdate=April 22, 2015|date=October 15, 2000}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Richard Branson: The Autobiography: "The tears streamed from my face."", ''The Times'', London, 7 September 1998&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 2010 it was reported by ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' that ''Losing my Virginity'' was being adapted into a biopic by [[David Mirkin]], who would write, direct and co-produce the film with [[Steven Paul]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.variety.com/article/VR1118026560|title=David Mirkin to adapt Richard Branson's memoir|work=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]|author=McNary, Dave|date=2010-10-29|accessdate=2011-06-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Content==
''Losing my Virginity'' is dedicated to 'Alex Ritchie and his family' and a note before the prologue thanks Edward Whitley who helped Branson with the writing of the book. The prologue of the book recounts the start of a round-the-world balloon trip over the [[Atlas Mountains]] in Morocco, and is followed by 28 chapters in which Branson recounts the first 43 years of his life. The book ends in January 1993, in the wake of [[Virgin Atlantic]]'s victory in their court case against [[British Airways]]. An epilogue briefly details events since 1993 including the launch of [[Virgin Cola]], the financial services company [[Virgin Direct]] and Branson's charitable bid to run the United Kingdom's [[National Lottery (UK)|National Lottery]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="14900">'''Policy Governance''', informally known as the '''Carver model''', is a system for organizational [[governance]]. Policy Governance defines and guides appropriate relationships between an organization's owners, its [[board of directors]], and its [[chief executive]].

The Policy Governance approach was first developed in the 1970s by [[John Carver (board policy)|John Carver]] who has registered the term as a [[service mark]] in order to control accurate description of the model.&lt;ref name="ServiceMark"&gt;CarverGovernance.com [http://www.carvergovernance.com/faq1.htm#registered "Why is Policy Governance a registered service mark?"]&lt;/ref&gt; The model is available for all to use without royalties or license fees and has been adopted by commercial, nonprofit, and public sector organizations.

==Principles of Policy Governance==
There are ten Principles of Policy Governance.&lt;ref name="Principles"&gt;International Policy Governance Association (IPGA) [http://www.policygovernanceassociation.org/resources/principles-of-policy-governance.html "Principles of Policy Governance"]&lt;/ref&gt;

Principles 1-3 define an organization's ownership, the board's responsibility to it, and the board's authority. Principles 4-7 specify that the board defines in writing policies identifying the benefits that should come about from the organization, how the board should conduct itself, and how staff behavior is to be proscribed. Principles 8-10 deal with the board's delegation and monitoring.

In general, if a board applies ALL of the principles of Policy Governance in its process and decision-making, then the board is likely practicing the model. If a board applies fewer than all the principles, it weakens or destroys the model’s effectiveness as a system.&lt;ref name="Reinventing Your Board"&gt;{{cite book|last=Carver|first=John|title=Reinventing your board : a step-by-step guide to implementing policy governance|year=2006|publisher=Jossey-Bass|location=San Francisco, Calif.|edition=Rev.|author2=Miriam Carver}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|38–39}}

==Claims for the model==
Authors of the Policy Governance model say it is a paradigm shift from the traditional practice of governance and that it provides a clear differentiation between governance and management responsibilities in organizations.

Policy Governance begins with a definition of governance as "Seeing to it that the organization achieves what it should and avoids unacceptable situations."  From this definition, board governance is at an arm's length from operations.

The board's primary relationship is with the organization's 'ownership'. As a result, governance is a downward extension of ownership rather than an upward extension of management. In this space, the board, as a single entity, assumes a governance position that is the link between ownership and the operational organization.  That governance position is a commanding authority. The board exists to exercise that commanding authority and to properly empower others. "Proper empowerment" means to define the results to be achieved by the organization (Ends), and define what would be considered unacceptable in terms of ethics and prudence (Executive Limitations).  The board delegates the job of achieving its Ends within the parameters defined in policy to the CEO.  To complete the delegation, the board rigorously monitors performance to policy to uphold accountability of the CEO.

In Policy Governance, the board has three primary jobs:  Ownership Linkage - connecting with owners to learn their values about ends that are desired and means that would be unacceptable; Policy Development - writing those values as guidance for organization and for the board itself; and Assurance of Organizational Performance - monitoring to ensure the organization demonstrates reasonable progress toward desired ends and reasonable compliance with policy guiding means.  The board's focus is at the broadest level of policy informed by the ownership's values.  When writing policy, the board only goes into as much detail as needed, and stops making policy when it can accept any reasonable interpretation of its policy language.

Experts in the model argue boards should govern with an emphasis on (a) outward vision rather than an internal preoccupation, (b) encouragement of diversity in viewpoints, (c) strategic leadership more than administrative detail, (d) clear distinction of board and chief executive roles, (e) collective rather than individual decisions, (f) future rather than past or present, and (g) proactivity rather than reactivity.

Templates of policies are provided in the literature &lt;ref name="Reinventing Your Board" /&gt;{{rp|233–255}} &lt;ref name="That Create Value"&gt;{{cite book|last=Carver|first=John|title=Corporate Boards That Create Value: Governing Company Performance from the Boardroom|year=2002|publisher=Jossey Bass|author2=Caroline Oliver}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|141–175}} &lt;ref name=Playbook&gt;{{cite book|last=Carver|first=Miriam|title=The Board Member's Playbook: Using Policy Governance to Solve Problems, Make Decisions, and Build a Stronger Board|year=2004|publisher=Jossey Bass|author2=Charney, Bill}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|255–277}} and by those trained in the model in order to illustrate what model-consistent policies might look like.  However these templates are not themselves the model and their use does not substitute for a board developing its own policies using the model’s principles.  Each policy that a board adopts should be an organizational value statement that reflects the shared values of that organization's ownership.

Many people confuse modification of policy language so that it fits their organization with changing the model itself.  Model-consistent practice is assessed by considering whether board performance aligns with the model's principles, not by reviewing the policy language that is adopted.

==Criticism of the model==

Industry Canada in the ''Primer For Directors of Not-For–Profit Corporations'' expressed concern about Policy Governance. They argue that “Some models of board governance—notably originating in the United States—advocate that directors limit themselves to policy matters only and leave responsibility for administration and day-to-day matters with the executive staff of the corporation. This limited role for directors does not reflect the obligations that are legally imposed upon directors.” &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Primer for Directors of Not-for-Profit Corporations|year=2002|publisher=Industry Canada|isbn=0-662-32550-8|url=http://www.ic.gc.ca/eic/site/cilp-pdci.nsf/eng/h_cl00688.html|editor=Peter Broder|accessdate=12 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|64}}

Hugh Kelly QC of the Canadian legal firm Miller Thomson LLP responded directly to this criticism concluding that:  “The board of a Canadian charitable corporation that adopts Policy Governance has performed 'due diligence', and fulfilled all legal obligations imposed upon its directors. On a comparative basis, such boards and directors are far ahead of most corporations, even those in the world of commerce, in observing their legal and moral obligations.” &lt;ref name="PG in Canada"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Kelly|first=H.M.|title=Carver Policy Governance in Canada|journal=Miller Thomson LLP Charities and Not-For-Profit Newsletter|date=July 2003|pages=7–9|url=http://www.millerthomson.com/assets/files/newsletter_attachments/issues/charities_july_2003.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|9}}

Others have expressed concern that the Policy Governance model may not be as universally applicable as suggested by Carver and that the model has a tendency to break down during times of crisis.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.voteanthony.com/?p=67&lt;/ref&gt; Addressing the universality concern, proponents of Policy Governance argue that, because the model is rooted in the generic purpose and nature of board authority rather than current practice of the specifics of any industry, at the level of its fundamental principles Policy Governance is indeed applicable to all governing boards.&lt;ref name="That Create Value" /&gt;{{rp|10}} Proponents also argue that at times of crisis, holding onto the  precepts of Policy Governance is in fact key to organizational survival and that rehearsing the use of the system in light of various scenarios can help build an organization's resilience to risk.&lt;ref name="That Create Value" /&gt;{{rp|110}} &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=When Crisis Strikes|journal=Governing Excellence: The Voice of the International Policy Governance Association|year=2002|volume=2002|issue=4|page=3|url=http://www.boundarymanagement.com/ipga%20documents/ipga%20newsletter%20winter%202002.pdf|editor1-first=Caroline|editor1-last=Oliver}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Two more widely accepted criticisms are that the model demands a level of precision that boards can find hard to achieve—even though it is usually no more than they demand of their staff—and without care, that the model's use can deteriorate over time and its protections fail to function. Many proponents point to the challenges presented by board member turnover and the need, as with any other professional discipline, for boards to continuously invest in their own training and support.&lt;ref name="Reinventing Your Board" /&gt;{{rp|222–229}} &lt;ref name="Getting Started" /&gt; {{rp|178–187}}&lt;ref name=Fieldbook /&gt; {{rp|161–190}}

Some authors and users of the model may misinterpret the distinction between 'ends' and 'means' to require a strict separation of responsibility between the board, which should focus exclusively on 'ends', and management, which should focus on the 'means' by which to achieve those ends.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.slideshare.net/svbenoit/policy-governance-reviewed&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Oneota-critique"&gt;http://ouroneotacoop.blogspot.com/2009/02/policy-governance-is-system-of.html&lt;/ref&gt; This interpretation is not supported by a close reading of the Policy Governance model. Carver states: 
"because the board is accountable for everything, it is accountable for means as well. Accordingly, it must exercise control over both ends and means, so having the ends/means distinction does not in itself relieve boards from any responsibility".&lt;ref name="Carver-NP"&gt;http://www.carvergovernance.com/pg-np.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

Another, related, misinterpretation is a belief that boards following Carver's model should not involve themselves with detailed understanding and/or monitoring of the organization's activities.&lt;ref name="Oneota-critique" /&gt; This belief is based on Carver's caution against excessive intrusion into the operational details. However, Carver is clear that boards remain accountable to their owners for all operational details and must therefore control them—the question is how to make this practical. As a way to avoid excessive intrusion, he advises the use of 'nested sets' of expectations, in progressively more narrow policy language, in order to define its meaning with greater precision until: "At some point, the board will have narrowed its words to the point that it can accept any reasonable interpretation of those words. Now the board has reached the point of delegation".&lt;ref name="Carver-NP" /&gt;

Because a board has ultimate power over the organization, to include all its operations, some critics point out that a board should not delegate any of its authority, because it ignores major areas of its responsibility if it "hands over" part of its power to the CEO.  This criticism points out that delegation, the granting of authority to the CEO, can become an "abdication" of the board's responsibility to control all organizational actions.  Delegation can become an abdication if it occurs without adequate supervision.  Delegation accompanied by careful monitoring to ensure it achieves the results intended is an exercise of the "due diligence" expected of the board.

Further criticism relates to the failure of some boards to follow their own policies.  Following policies that guide the board in its own governance process, and its relationship with the CEO, is an act of self-discipline by which the board imposes checks and balances on its own power.  These self-limiting policies protect staff from board actions that might get in the way of successful organizational performance.  They also protect the CEO, and the board itself, from possible actions of individual board members.  A board may give a false sense that it is acting in the best interests of the organization while ignoring its own policies, and therefore promotes a "veil" of legitimacy behind which it acts in capricious ways.  Such a board distracts itself from the real job boards should be doing.  Ultimately, whether a board remains true to its own policies is a matter for the board itself to determine.  Carver notes this concern when he acknowledges that Policy Governance will not  make "a bad board good."

'''Richard Brathwaite Hope Hall''' [[Independence Commemorative Decoration|ICD]] (5 June 1924 – 17 November 2007) was a [[United Kingdom|British]]-born merchant banker, businessman, and politician active in [[Rhodesia]] (now [[Zimbabwe]]) during the 1960s and 70s. A member of [[Prime Minister of Rhodesia|Prime Minister]] [[Ian Smith]]'s [[Rhodesia's Unilateral Declaration of Independence|UDI]] cabinet,&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hope Hall|first=Robert|date=January 2016|title=Obituary|url=http://www.britishisrael.co.uk/newsletter/12.pdf|journal=The British-Israel-World Federation Newsletter|volume=|pages=14|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; he served as a [[Member of parliament|Member of Parliament]] in Rhodesia's [[House of Assembly (Zimbabwe)|House of Assembly]] from 1965 to 1976.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hill|first=Geoffrey|date=2007|title=Richard Brathwaite Hope Hall|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=EUUxAQAAIAAJ&amp;q=member+of+Ian+Smith%27s+Rhodesian+Front+party,+he+clearly+ejg%5E&amp;dq=member+of+Ian+Smith%27s+Rhodesian+Front+party,+he+clearly+ejg%5E&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjiitT9-LvVAhUq8IMKHdLnC6AQ6AEIKDAA|journal=[[Rhodesians Worldwide]]|volume=21-23|pages=26|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://springbokcybernewsletter.blogspot.com/2013/08/|title=August 2013 Edition.|last=Harvey|first=Alan|date=2013-08-09|website=Springbok Cyber Newsletter|access-date=2017-08-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; He began his political career as a member of the [[Dominion Party]], and served as its chairman from 1960 to 1962. In 1962, he was a founding member of the [[Rhodesian Front]], but switched to the [[Rhodesian Action Party]] in 1976. After unsuccessfully running for re-election in [[Rhodesian general election, 1977|1977]], he moved back to the United Kingdom, where he lived until his death.

== Early life and education ==
Hope Hall was born on 5 June 1924 in [[Bideford]], [[Devon]], [[England]], [[United Kingdom]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.genealogy.com/ftm/m/a/r/George-S-Mardall/COL1-0017.html|title=Report|last=|first=|date=|website=www.genealogy.com|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2017-08-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9EAOAQAAMAAJ&amp;dq=richard+braithwaite+hope+hall+rhodesia&amp;focus=searchwithinvolume&amp;q=richard+braithwaite+|title=Africa Who's Who|last=Uwechue|first=Raph|publisher=Africa Journal Limited|year=1991|isbn=9780903274173|location=|pages=768|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=kG1mAAAAMAAJ&amp;dq=richard+braithwaite+hope+hall+rhodesia&amp;focus=searchwithinvolume&amp;q=braithwaite|title=Who's who of Rhodesia, Mauritius, Central and East Africa|last=|first=|date=|publisher=Combined Publishers|year=1967|isbn=|location=|pages=|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was educated at [[Charterhouse School]] in [[Godalming]],&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; then he served in the [[Royal Navy]] during [[World War II]] as a Lieutenant in the Royal Naval Reserve where he was mentioned in Despatches.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://discovery.nationalarchives.gov.uk/browse/r/h/C10913680|title=The Discovery Service|last=Archives|first=The National|website=discovery.nationalarchives.gov.uk|language=en-GB|access-date=2017-08-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the war, he became partially deaf as a result of exposure to gunfire.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; In 1947, he was [[Demobilization|demobilized]] as Senior AA Gunnery Lieutenant on the carrier HMS Hunter.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  He embarked on his career in merchant banking.  In 1948 he got a transfer to Cape Town . In June 1950, he moved to [[Southern Rhodesia]] to set up a branch of what was later to be known as UDC in Salisbury.,&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

== Political career ==
Upon moving to [[Southern Rhodesia]], Hope Hall became involved in business and politics. Initially setting up UDC in Salisbury he moved on to work for Standard Finance.  Around the same time he went into partnership with John Smith with Smith &amp; Hall pianos&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; He joined the [[Dominion Party]], and ran unsuccessfully for parliament in 1959.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; From 1960 to 1962, he chaired Dominion Party,&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; which after 1960 was solely based in Southern Rhodesia, when the party's Northern Rhodesian and Nyasaland branches split off to form the [[Federal Dominion Party]]. In March 1962, when the Dominion Party was reconstituted as the [[Rhodesian Front]], Hope Hall was a founding member.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

In [[Rhodesian general election, 1965|1965]], the year Rhodesia [[Rhodesia's Unilateral Declaration of Independence|declared independence]] from the United Kingdom, Hope Hall won election to the [[House of Assembly (Zimbabwe)|House of Assembly]] as the Rhodesian Front candidate for the Highlands South constituency.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Povall Smith|first=Elsie|date=October 1995|title=Our Kind of People|url=http://www.rhodesia.com/oz_wa/povall.html|journal=Bundu Times|volume=|pages=|via=Rhodesian Association of Western Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=oxksAQAAIAAJ&amp;dq=richard+hope+hall+rhodesia&amp;focus=searchwithinvolume&amp;q=hope-hall|title=Summary of World Broadcasts|last=|first=|publisher=British Broadcasting Corporation|year=1977|isbn=|location=|pages=|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was reelected in [[Rhodesian general election, 1970|1970]] with 76% of the vote, and again in [[Rhodesian general election, 1974|1974]] with 75% of the vote. On 27 March 1973, he was elected Deputy Speaker of the House of Assembly and Chairman of Committees.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=DqBGAAAAMAAJ&amp;q=richard+braithwaite+hope+hall+rhodesia&amp;dq=richard+braithwaite+hope+hall+rhodesia&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiU64Pe8bvVAhWHzIMKHcGNBDQQ6AEIPjAF|title=Parliamentary Debates - House of Assembly|last=|first=|date=|publisher=House of Assembly of Rhodesia|year=1977|isbn=|location=|pages=18|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=GX1CAQAAIAAJ&amp;q=richard+hope+hall+rhodesia&amp;dq=richard+hope+hall+rhodesia&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiB3rXW8bjVAhWF2YMKHatcCM8Q6AEIRTAG|title=Votes and Proceedings of the House of Assembly|last=|first=|publisher=House of Assembly of Rhodesia|year=1973|isbn=|location=|pages=304|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was a member of the parliamentary caucus all through his career and was at the meeting where the PM The Hon. Ian Douglas Smith asked each member on their view of the way forward. Richard agreed the a declaration of Independence was the only way but stipulated that if declared then a national day of prayer be called.  This was heartily seconded by Angus Graham (Duke of Montrose).  There followed, 'two of the most peaceful years of my life' as he recalled to his son Andrew later.&lt;ref&gt;From Andrew Hope Hal's current works on his personal memoire "Recollections of War, peace, activism and faith".&lt;/ref&gt;

He was a member of the Police 'C' Reserve throughout his time in Rhodesia and ended as the Commander of the Highlands Police Station C Reserve.  His son Mark served in the C Reserve in between call-ups to the army.

In 1977, the Rhodesian parliament was presented with a highly controversial bill that, if passed, would open up some areas of European-designated land to African ownership. The House of Assembly voted on [[Land Tenure Amendment Act|Land Tenure Amendment Bill]] on 4 March 1977. On a [[three line whip]], Hope Hall and 11 other conservative Rhodesian Front MPs voted against the bill. Nicknamed the Dirty Dozen by the Rhodesian press, Hope Hall and the other MPs left Rhodesian Front and formed the right-wing [[Rhodesian Action Party]].&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Prime Minister [[Ian Smith]], whose party had now lost its two-thirds majority needed to amend the Constitution responded by dissolving the House of Assembly and scheduling elections earlier than previously planned. In the 1977 general elections, Hope Hall, along with the other Rhodesian Action Party members, lost his seat in parliament.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; After 1977, Hope Hall never ran for elected office again.

== Later life and death ==
Hope Hall remained in Rhodesia through the [[Zimbabwe Rhodesia]] period.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  In September 1979, six months  before [[Robert Mugabe]] would become president of the new [[Zimbabwe]] government, Hope Hall and his wife left and moved to the United Kingdom, losing most of their possessions.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; They settled in Tadley, where his wife worked as a nurse at a local hospital.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Hope Hall died on 17 November 2007 at his home in Tadley.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; He died around mid-day, having gone for his daily hour-long walk earlier that morning.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; He was survived by his wife, his three sons, and eight grandchildren.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; He is buried in Tadley, next to his wife, who died in 2015.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Their shared tombstone simply says "Rhodesians."&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Personal life ==
Hope Hall was married to Renée Evelyn Tyndale-Biscoe.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; He met her in the early 1950s in [[Salisbury, Rhodesia|Salisbury]] (now Harare), where she taught at [[Girls High School, Harare|Girls High School]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; They were married at the [[Cathedral of St Mary and All Saints, Harare|Salisbury Anglican Cathedral]] on 16 February 1952.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; After marrying, they bought a home in Salisbury on Wingate Road.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; They later relocated to Dulwich Road in the Highlands area, the constituency Hope Hall would later represent in Parliament.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Together, they had three sons:&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; Robert, Mark, and Andrew.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Their sons were educated at [[St. John's Preparatory School (Harare)|St. John's Preparatory School]] and [[Falcon College]],&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; and all fought in the [[Rhodesian Bush War]], Robert in 4th Bn RR, Mark in the highly successful 3 Indep Company - then 4th Bn RR and Andrew in the BSAP Black Boots. Robert left Rhodesia in 1977, Mark in October 1978 and Andrew leaving Zimbabwe in January 1983.    Renée Hope Hall worked at the Rhodesian Front headquarters and managed her husband's political campaigns.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Renee also trained Police reservists in First aid and helped out with ambulance driving and WVRS forces canteens.

Hope Hall was an amateur [[ornithologist]] and could identify a bird by its song from twenty yards away, despite his partial deafness from the war.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

In July 2012 Mezouar was involved in a scandal related to wage bonuses along with [[Noureddine Bensouda]], the chief of the Moroccan treasury.&lt;ref name=AP/&gt; Leaked documents, revealed that Bensouda and Mezouar issued orders to reward themselves with substantial monthly and quarterly bonuses.&lt;ref name=AP/&gt; The bonues totaled roughly  MAD97,772/month (US$12,000).&lt;ref name=demain&gt;{{cite news|title=Salaheddine Mezouar reconnait la réalité des primes|url=http://www.demainonline.com/2012/06/14/salaheddine-mezouar-reconnait-la-realite-des-primes/|accessdate=21 March 2014|newspaper=[[Demain online]]|date=14 June 2012|author=Badr Soundouss|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140322030123/http://www.demainonline.com/2012/06/14/salaheddine-mezouar-reconnait-la-realite-des-primes/#|archive-date=2014-03-22|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mezouar declared that the bonuses were legal basing the decision on a 1941 decree by the French colonial-head which is still enforced. The French decree allowed such bonuses to be issued for high-ranking employees of the colonial administration.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7349">A '''''shotgun clause''''' (or Texas Shootout Clause&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.law.harvard.edu/programs/olin_center/papers/pdf/Spier_632.pdf|title = Trigger Happy or Gun Shy? Dissolving Common-Value Partnerships with Texas Shootouts|date = |accessdate = |website = |publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt;) is a [[term of art]], rather than a legal term. It is a specific type of exit provision that may be included in a [[shareholders' agreement]], and may often be referred to as a [[buy-sell agreement]]. The shotgun clause allows a shareholder to offer a specific price per share for the other shareholder(s)' shares; the other shareholder(s) must then either accept the offer or buy the offering shareholder's shares at that price per share.

==Discussion==

Typically, an exit clause is triggered in situations where a business partnership has severely deteriorated, and so the situation is often likened to a divorce. In the same way that drawn-out battles between a splitting couple can often leave children with emotional damage, so too can a business be damaged by drawn-out fighting between its owners. For this reason, experts in the area emphasize the importance of including an exit clause in a firm's shareholders' agreement in order to minimize the negative impact of a business-divorce. As with a [[prenuptial agreement]], it is important to set out an exit clause early on in a business relationship when interests are still aligned and partners still like each other.

Shotgun clauses protect the interests of both or all parties regardless of their stake in the company. If one party decides to trigger the clause, it is in their best interest to make a well considered, fair offer - for if they make a low offer, their partner(s) may raise the resources to turn the offer against them, a counteroffer they would be bound to accept.

==Process==

The shareholder triggering the clause offers to buy the shares of the others at a specific price per share. The other shareholder(s) must then either accept the offer and sell their shares, or buy the triggering shareholders' shares at that same price. Alternatively, the clause can be structured so that the triggering shareholder offers to sell his shares at a specific price per share, and the other shareholders can then accept the offer or sell their shares to the triggering shareholder at the set price.

The timeline is generally very short, although there are no hard and fast rules. It would not be unusual to have 20 to 40 days to elect to sell or buy, and another 20 to 40 days to close. If the recipient of the offer does not respond in the allotted period of time, the offer is assumed to have been accepted.

==Rationale==

The clause is most applicable when both partners want to run the company, but not together, and an amicable buy-out cannot be reached . It serves as a sort of last resort method for solving these disputes, while also helping to ensure that a fair price is offered. When triggering a shotgun clause, the offering partner does not know whether they will end up buying or selling their shares, so the individual must – in theory – pick a price that they would find acceptable in either outcome, thus preventing large over- or under-valuations of the firm.

==Potential Problems==

A certain amount of strategy enters into how and when to trigger the shotgun clause with the offering shareholder having the incentive to guess at the other shareholders' ability to finance a buyout. If one is financially limited, or unable to run the company on his own, then the other can trigger the clause and offer a low price for the shares, gambling that their partner will have no choice but to accept. In this sense, the shotgun clause favours shareholders with stronger cash resources, and encourages shareholders to pull the trigger when the other shareholder(s) are weak. This problem is exacerbated by the fact that obtaining financing from banks is difficult in these situations, due to the shotgun transaction's very short timeline. Private equity and venture capital firms that provide funding for these situations can help to level the playing field (see Financing section below), although they are limited in number.

The shotgun clause is also biased towards shareholders with a greater ability to run the company themselves. A partner who is capable of running the business on their own would be able to offer a lower price than a partner who could not. For example, if one shareholder became disabled or seriously ill, they might be unable to manage the company. The other shareholder(s) might take advantage of the situation by triggering the shotgun clause at a low value, knowing that the other shareholder would not be able to buy them out.

==Financing==

Shotgun clauses tend to favour people with cash readily available. Once a shotgun clause has been triggered, shareholders can often face difficulties obtaining traditional financing in order to buy the other shareholders' shares, due largely to the very short timeline of the transaction. Financing commitments from traditional banks typically take too long to obtain, and lenders often avoid situations where management conflicts are likely to disrupt the business. This means that owners facing a triggered shotgun clause are often forced to rely on their own resources if they wish to fend off being bought out. However, there are some private equity and venture capital firms that specialize in providing capital for shotgun situations.

==Economics==

In academic circles it has been argued that, under certain circumstances, these clauses are not economically efficient in that the partner who values the company most is not always the one that ends up buying the company. De Frutos and Kittsteiner suggest in their paper that in order to ensure an efficient outcome, there should not be a contractual obligation for the party who triggers the clause to name the price. Instead, they advocate including in the termination agreement a clause stating that the parties will negotiate for the right to be the person who chooses whether to buy or sell at the price specified by the other partner. They suggest that this negotiation take the form of an ascending auction where the shareholders bid for the right not to set the price per share. Each partner raises his/her bid continuously, but either partner can drop out of the auction at any time. The party that drops out becomes the one who must propose the price per share, but that person receives a payment from the other partner equal to the bid at which the auction ended.

[[File:Intel Ronler Acres Hillsboro Oregon.JPG|thumb|Intel's Ronler Acres campus in Hillsboro]]
'''Silicon Forest''' is a nickname for the cluster of [[computing technology|high-tech]] companies located in the [[Portland, Oregon|Portland]] metropolitan area in the [[U.S. state]] of [[Oregon]], and most frequently refers to the industrial corridor between [[Beaverton, Oregon|Beaverton]] and [[Hillsboro, Oregon|Hillsboro]] in northwest Oregon.

The name is analogous to [[Silicon Valley]].  In the [[Portland metropolitan area|greater Portland]] area, these companies have traditionally specialized in hardware — specifically test-and-measurement equipment ([[Tektronix]]), computer chips ([[Intel]] and an array of smaller chip manufacturers), electronic displays ([[InFocus]], Planar and [[Pixelworks]]) and printers ([[Hewlett-Packard|Hewlett-Packard Co]], [[Xerox]] and [[Epson]]). There is a small [[clean technology]] emphasis in the area.&lt;ref name="cleantech"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Alpern|first=Peter|title=Portland Cultivates Future as Hub for Manufacturing Alternative Energy|journal=IndustryWeek|date=Oct 4, 2010|url=http://www.industryweek.com/articles/portland_cultivates_future_as_hub_for_manufacturing_alternative_energy_22925.aspx|accessdate=30 November 2011|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101030033439/http://www.industryweek.com/articles/portland_cultivates_future_as_hub_for_manufacturing_alternative_energy_22925.aspx|archivedate=30 October 2010|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
[[File:Mentor Graphics entrance.JPG|thumb|Mentor Graphics headquarters in [[Wilsonville, Oregon|Wilsonville]]]]
Silicon Forest can refer to all the technology companies in Oregon,&lt;ref name=name&gt;Rogoway, Mike (April 9, 2006). Bizz blog: Silicon Forest. ''[[The Oregonian]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; but initially referred to [[Washington County, Oregon|Washington County]] on Portland’s west side. First used in a Japanese company’s press release dating to 1981, [[Lattice Semiconductor]] trademarked the term in 1984 but does not use the term in its marketing materials.&lt;ref name=name/&gt; Lattice’s founder is sometimes mentioned as the person who came up with the term.&lt;ref name=name/&gt;

The high-tech industry in the Portland area dates back to at least the 1940s, with [[Tektronix]] and [[Electro Scientific Industries]] as pioneers.&lt;ref name="Oreg1994"&gt;Manaton, Michael E. (August 4, 1994). "Tektronix began 'Silicon Forest' boom". ''[[The Oregonian]]'' (MetroWest edition).&lt;/ref&gt; Tektronix and ESI both started out in Portland proper, but moved to Washington County in 1951 and 1962, respectively, and developed sites designed to attract other high-tech companies.&lt;ref name="Oreg1994"/&gt;  [[Floating Point Systems]], co-founded by three former Tektronix employees in Beaverton in 1970, was the first spin-off company in Silicon Forest and the third (after Tek and ESI) to be traded on the [[NYSE]].&lt;ref&gt;G.B. Dodds, C.E. Wollner &amp; M.M. Lee, ''The Silicon Forest'', Oregon Historical Society Press, 1990, p 46-55.&lt;/ref&gt; These three companies, and later [[Intel]], led to the creation of a number of other [[Corporate spin-off|spin-off]]s and [[Startup company|startup]]s, some of which were remarkably successful.  A 2003 dissertation on these spin-offs led to a poster depicting the genealogy of 894 Silicon Forest companies.&lt;ref name=PSU&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.pdx.edu/ims/silicon-forest-universe |title=Silicon Forest Universe |publisher= [[Portland State University]]: The Institute for Portland Metropolitan Studies |accessdate= 2010-06-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; High-tech employment in the state reached a peak of almost 73,000 in 2001, but has never recovered from the [[dot-com bubble|dot-com bust]]. Statewide, tech employment totaled 57,000 in the spring of 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.oregonlive.com/silicon-forest/index.ssf/2012/07/investment_in_oregon_tech_comp.html | work=The Oregonian | title=Investment in Oregon tech companies heats up, but employment hasn't bounced back | date=July 26, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Unlike other regions with a "silicon" appellation, [[Semiconductor device fabrication|semiconductors]] truly are the heart of Oregon's tech industry.

Intel's headquarters remain in [[Santa Clara, California]], but in the 1990s the company began moving its most advanced technical operations to Oregon. Its Ronler Acres campus eventually became its most advanced anywhere, and Oregon is now Intel's largest operating hub. As of late 2012, Intel has close to 17,000 employees in Oregon—more than anywhere else the company operates.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.oregonlive.com/silicon-forest/index.ssf/2012/10/intel_makes_a_bet_on_oregon_an.html | work=The Oregonian | title=Intel makes a bet on the future, and Oregon, with massive Hillsboro expansion | date=October 24, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Labor |expanded=Movement}}

'''Social movement unionism''' ('''SMU''') is a trend of theory and practice in contemporary trade unionism.  Strongly associated with the labour movements of developing countries, social movement unionism is distinct from many other models of trade unionism because it concerns itself with more than organizing workers around workplace issues, pay and terms and conditions. It engages in wider political struggles for human rights, social justice and democracy. Social movement unionism grew out of political struggles in developing countries and was theorized as a distinct industrial relations model in the late 1980s and early 1990s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Waterman|first=Peter|title=Social-Movement Unionism: A New Union Model for a New World Order|jstor=40241259|work=Review (Fernand Braudel Center)|publisher=Fernand Braudel Center}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In this model, trade unions are not distinct from social movements and form part of a wider ecosystem of political activism that includes faith groups, civic and residents' organizations and student groups. These are usually organized into democratic umbrella organizations along a [[popular front]] model. The umbrella organization generally has a programme or manifesto that all affiliates commit themselves to.

A prime example of social movement unionism is the link between the trade union federation [[Cosatu]] and the wider anti-[[apartheid]] struggle through the [[United Democratic Front (South Africa)|United Democratic Front]] in [[South Africa]] in the 1980s. More recently, Cosatu has successfully campaigned with the [[Treatment Action Campaign]] for access to medication for [[HIV]]-[[Aids]]. Social movement unionism is also a feature of the industrial relations of Brazil and the Philippines.

SMU is widely considered&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Scipes|first=Kim|title=Understanding the New Labor Movements in the "Third World":  The Emergence of Social Movement Unionism, a New Type of Trade Unionism|url=http://www.labournet.de/diskussion/gewerkschaft/smu/The_New_Unions_Crit_Soc.htm|work=Critical Sociology|publisher=Sage|accessdate=12 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  to be a highly dynamic and successful model, as evidenced by the success against apartheid and for treatment access, and by the fact that countries practising this model have generally reversed the trend of trade union decline experienced in the developed world. For instance, union density grew in South Africa by 130% between 1985 and 1995,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=ILO|title=ILO Highlights Global Challenge to Trade Unions|url=http://www.ilo.org/global/about-the-ilo/press-and-media-centre/news/WCMS_008032/lang--en/index.htm|work=International Labour Organization|accessdate=12 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; during a period of steep decline in many developed countries.
 
In the developed world, SMU is strongly associated with the [[organizing model]] of [[trade union]]ism, and overlaps with [[community unionism]].  SMU attempts to integrate workers, trade unions and the labour movement into broader coalitions for social and economic justice. Thus, in principle, unions and other organizations support each other in what are seen as mutually beneficial goals.

The campus [[living wage]] work of unions, which have frequently worked with chapters of United Students Against Sweatshops, are an example of the principle in practice.  Similarly, the 'Teamsters for Turtles' (as their T-shirts had it) at Seattle signalled a willingness of sections of the labour movement to engage with environmental concerns.

Other prominent examples include the relationship between [[Reclaim the Streets]] and the Liverpool Dockers (UK) during their [[Liverpool Dockers' Strike|strike in the late 1990s]]; and the relationship between the [[Coalition of Immokalee Workers]] and progressive US students during the [[Boot the Bell]] campaign. Various labour–environmental coalitions also fit this social movement model.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.informaworld.com/smpp/content~db=all~content=a912901178 ''Uniting to Win: Labor-Environmental Alliances'', by Dan Jakopovich]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Union initiatives ==
{{See also|Social justice}}
Union support for [[social justice]] causes can come from  within the scope of their respective [[collective bargaining|collective agreements]]. [[Trade unions|Union]]s are increasingly demanding that new collective agreements contain clauses that are intended to further social justice. The inclusion of social justice support in a negotiated contract, compels all parties to support these causes in a legally binding way.

This may extend to funding the education of [[wikt:rank and file|rank and file]] union members in various social justice issues (i.e. [[fair trade]] policies, anti-poverty initiatives, anti-[[globalization]] campaigns and race, gender and human rights issues, etc.) and financial or technical support for non-union causes. Generally speaking, social movement unionism advocates greater levels of [[democracy]] and equality for all people, regardless of union membership.

===Collective bargaining===

During contract negotiations or [[collective bargaining]], some unions are pushing for the inclusion of various social justice clauses to be added to the [[Contract|collective agreement]]. One example of this may be a demand that a percentage of future wages be transferred to a fund to be used to effect social justice issues nationally or internationally on behalf of the union membership. Another example is a recent trend of demanding a portion of hourly wages to be deferred to a paid education leave (PEL) fund, to allow union members to leave the work place for a period of time, at no loss of pay, so they can attend social justice seminars and educational programs. These demands are forwarded as proposals to the employer during collective bargaining negotiations.

'''Throughput accounting''' (TA) is a principle-based and simplified [[management accounting]] approach that provides managers with decision support information for enterprise profitability improvement. TA is relatively new in management accounting. It is an approach that identifies factors that limit an organization from reaching its goal, and then focuses on simple measures that drive behavior in key areas towards reaching organizational goals. TA was proposed by [[Eliyahu M. Goldratt]]&lt;ref&gt;Eliyahu M. Goldratt and Jeff Cox - The Goal - {{ISBN|0-620-33597-1}}.&lt;/ref&gt; as an alternative to traditional [[cost accounting]]. As such, Throughput Accounting&lt;ref&gt;Thomas Corbett - Throughput Accounting - {{ISBN|0-88427-158-7}}.&lt;/ref&gt; is neither [[cost accounting]] nor costing because it is cash focused and does not allocate all costs (variable and fixed expenses, including overheads) to products and services sold or provided by an enterprise. Considering the laws of variation, only costs that vary totally with units of output (see definition of T below for TVC) e.g. raw materials, are allocated to products and services which are deducted from sales to determine Throughput.&lt;ref&gt;Etienne Du Plooy - Throughput Accounting Techniques - {{ISBN|978-0-9946979-0-5}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Throughput Accounting is a [[management accounting]] technique used as the performance measure in the [[Theory of Constraints]] (TOC).&lt;ref&gt;Eric Noreen - Theory of Constraints and its Implications for Management Accounting - {{ISBN|978-0-88427-116-1}}.&lt;/ref&gt; It is the business intelligence used for maximizing profits, however, unlike cost accounting that primarily focuses on 'cutting costs' and reducing expenses to make a profit, Throughput Accounting primarily focuses on generating more throughput.  Conceptually, Throughput Accounting seeks to increase the speed or rate at which throughput (see definition of T below) is generated by products and services with respect to an organization's constraint, whether the constraint is internal or external to the organization. Throughput Accounting is the only management accounting methodology that considers constraints as factors limiting the performance of organizations.

Management accounting is an organization's internal set of techniques and methods used to maximize shareholder wealth. Throughput Accounting is thus part of the management accountants' toolkit, ensuring efficiency where it matters as well as the overall effectiveness of the organization. It is an internal reporting tool. Outside or external parties to a business depend on accounting reports prepared by financial (public) accountants who apply Generally Accepted Accounting Principles ([[Generally accepted accounting principles|GAAP]]) issued by the [[Financial Accounting Standards Board]] (FASB) and enforced by the [[U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission]] (SEC) and other local and international regulatory agencies and bodies such as [[International Financial Reporting Standards]] (IFRS).

Throughput Accounting improves profit performance with better management decisions by using measurements that more closely reflect the effect of decisions on three critical monetary variables ([[Throughput (business)|throughput]], [[investment]] (AKA [[inventory]]), and [[operating expense]] — defined below).

== History ==
When cost accounting was developed in the 1890s, labor was the largest fraction of product cost and could be considered a variable cost. Workers often did not know how many hours they would work in a week when they reported on Monday morning because time-keeping systems were rudimentary. Cost accountants, therefore, concentrated on how efficiently managers used labor since it was their most important variable resource. Now however, workers who come to work on Monday morning almost always work 40 hours or more; their cost is fixed rather than variable. However, today, many managers are still evaluated on their labor efficiencies, and many "downsizing," "rightsizing," and other labor reduction campaigns are based on them.

Goldratt argues that, under current conditions, labor efficiencies lead to decisions that harm rather than help organizations. Throughput Accounting, therefore, removes [[standard cost accounting]]'s reliance on efficiencies in general, and labor efficiency in particular, from management practice. Many cost and financial accountants agree with Goldratt's critique, but they have not agreed on a replacement of their own and there is enormous inertia in the installed base of people trained to work with existing practices.

Constraints accounting, which is a development in the Throughput Accounting field, emphasizes the role of the [[Constraint (mathematics)|constraint]], (referred to as the Archemedian constraint) in decision making.&lt;ref&gt;John A. Caspari and Pamela Caspari - Management Dynamics - {{ISBN|0-471-67231-9}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

== The concepts of Throughput Accounting ==
Goldratt's alternative begins with the idea that each organization has a goal and that better decisions increase its value. The goal for a profit maximizing firm is stated as, increasing net profit now and in the future. [[Profit maximization]] seen from a Throughput Accounting viewpoint, is about maximizing a system's profit mix without [[Cost Accounting]]'s traditional allocation of total costs. Throughput Accounting actions include obtaining the maximum net profit in the minimum time period, given limited resource capacities and capabilities. These resources include machines, capital (own or borrowed), people, processes, technology, time, materials, markets, etc. Throughput Accounting applies to [[not-for-profit]] organizations too, where they develop their goal that makes sense in their individual cases, and these goals are commonly measured in goal units.

Throughput Accounting also pays particular attention to the concept of 'bottleneck' (referred to as ''constraint'' in the Theory of Constraints) in the manufacturing or servicing processes.

Throughput Accounting uses three measures of income and expense: [[Image:ThroughputStructure.jpg|thumb|right|500px|The chart illustrates a typical throughput structure of income (sales) and expenses (TVC and OE).&lt;br /&gt;T=Sales less TVC and NP=T less OE.]]

* [[Throughput (business)|Throughput]] (T) is the rate at which the system produces "goal units." When the goal units are money &lt;ref&gt;Eliyahu M. Goldratt - The Haystack Syndrome (pp 19) - {{ISBN|0-88427-089-0}}.&lt;/ref&gt; (in for-profit businesses), throughput is net sales (S) less totally variable cost (TVC), generally the cost of the raw materials (T = S – TVC). Note that T only exists when there is a sale of the product or service. Producing materials that sit in a warehouse does not form part of throughput but rather investment. ("Throughput" is sometimes referred to as "throughput contribution" and has similarities to the concept of "contribution" in marginal costing which is sales revenues less "variable" costs – "variable" being defined according to the marginal costing philosophy.)
* [[Investment]] (I) is the money tied up in the system. This is money associated with inventory, machinery, buildings, and other assets and liabilities. In earlier [[Theory of Constraints]] (TOC) documentation, the "I" was interchanged between "inventory" and "investment." The preferred term is now only "investment." Note that TOC recommends inventory be valued strictly on totally variable cost associated with creating the inventory, not with additional cost allocations from overhead.
* [[Operating expense]] (OE) is the money the system spends in generating "goal units." For physical products, OE is all expenses except the cost of the raw materials. OE includes maintenance, utilities, rent, taxes and payroll.

Organizations that wish to increase their attainment of ''[[The Goal]]'' should therefore require managers to test proposed decisions against three questions. Will the proposed change:

# Increase throughput? How?
# Reduce investment ([[inventory]]) (money that cannot be used)? How?
# Reduce [[operating expense]]? How?

The answers to these questions determine the effect of proposed changes on system wide measurements:

# [[Net profit]] (NP) = throughput – operating expense = T – OE
# [[Return on investment]] (ROI) = net profit / investment = NP/I
# TA [[Productivity]] = throughput / operating expense = T/OE
# Investment turns (IT) = throughput / investment = T/I

These relationships between financial ratios as illustrated by Goldratt are very similar to a set of relationships defined by [[DuPont]] and [[General Motors Corporation|General Motors]] financial executive [[Donaldson Brown]] about 1920. Brown did not advocate changes in management accounting methods, but instead used the ratios to evaluate traditional financial accounting data.

== Explanation ==

:&lt;math&gt;\text{Throughput} = \text{Sales revenue – Total Variable Costs}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Performance management, Paper f5. Kaplan publishing UK. Pg 17&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\text{Throughput accounting Ratio} = \text{Return per factory hour} / \text{Cost per factory hour}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Performance management, Paper f5. Kaplan publishing UK. Pg 17&lt;/ref&gt;

For example: The railway coach company was offered a contract to make 15 open-topped streetcars each month, using a design that included ornate brass foundry work, but very little of the metalwork needed to produce a covered rail coach. The buyer offered to pay $280 per streetcar. The company had a firm order for 40 rail coaches each month for $350 per unit.

:The cost accountant determined that the cost of operating the foundry vs. the metalwork shop each month was as follows:

{|class="wikitable" style="text-align:center"
|'''Overhead Cost by Department'''
|Total Cost ($)
|Hours Available per month
|Cost per hour ($)
|-
|Foundry
| 7,300.00

|Metal shop
| 3,300.00
|160
|20.63
|-
|Total
|10,600.00
|320
|33.13
|}

:The company was at full capacity making 40 rail coaches each month. And since the foundry was expensive to operate, and purchasing brass as a raw material for the streetcars was expensive, the accountant determined that the company would lose money on any streetcars it built. He showed an analysis of the estimated product costs based on [[standard cost accounting]] and recommended that the company decline to build any streetcars.

:However, the company's operations manager knew that recent investment in automated foundry equipment had created idle time for workers in that department. The constraint on production of the railcoaches was the metalwork shop. She made an analysis of profit and loss if the company took the contract using throughput accounting to determine the profitability of products by calculating "throughput" (revenue less variable cost) in the metal shop.

:After the presentations from the company accountant and the operations manager, the president understood that the metal shop capacity was limiting the company's profitability. The company could make only 40 rail coaches per month. But by taking the contract for the streetcars, the company could make nearly all the railway coaches ordered, and also meet all the demand for streetcars. The result would increase '''throughput''' in the metal shop from $6.25 to $10.38 per hour of available time, and increase profitability by 66 percent.

== Relevance ==
One of the most important aspects of Throughput Accounting is the relevance of the information it produces. Throughput Accounting reports what currently happens in business functions such as operations, distribution and marketing. It does not rely solely on GAAP's financial accounting reports (that still need to be verified by external auditors) and is thus relevant to current decisions made by management that affect the business now and in the future. Throughput Accounting is used in Critical Chain Project Management (CCPM),&lt;ref&gt;Eliyahu M. Goldratt - Critical Chain - {{ISBN|0-620-21256-X}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Drum Buffer Rope (DBR)—in businesses that are internally constrained, in Simplified Drum Buffer Rope (S-DBR) &lt;ref&gt;Eli Schragenheim and H William Dettmer - Manufacturing at Warp Speed - {{ISBN|1-57444-293-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;—in businesses that are externally constrained (particularly where the lack of customer orders denotes a market constraint), as well as in strategy, planning and tactics, etc.
