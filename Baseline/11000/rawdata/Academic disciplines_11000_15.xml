The '''2012 Hyderabad Conference''' of the Parties to the UN [[Convention on Biological Diversity]] (CBD) it was held from 1–19 October 2012 in [[Hyderabad, India]]. Environment Ministers and Forests Ministers of about 194 countries attended the Conference; international organisations like [[World Bank]] and the [[Asian Development Bank]] also participated. Nearly 8,000 to 10,000 delegates discussed issues relating to [[bio-diversity]] and bio-safety.&lt;ref name=PibPressRelease&gt;{{cite web|last=Press Information Bureau|first=Government of India|title=Hyderabad to Host UN Convention on Biodiversity|url=http://www.pib.nic.in/newsite/erelease.aspx?relid=72538}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Three Main Abrahamic Religions.svg|200px|thumb|[[Religious symbol|Symbols]] of the three largest Abrahamic religions: the Jewish [[Star of David]], the [[Christian cross]], and the Islamic [[star and crescent]].]]

The '''Abrahamic religions''', also referred to collectively as '''Abrahamism''', are a group of [[Semitic people|Semitic]]-originated [[Religion|religious]] communities of faith that claim descent from the [[Judaism]] of the ancient [[Israelites]] and the worship of the [[Yahweh|God of Abraham]]. The Abrahamic religions are monotheistic religions: they worship only one god, the unique God. The term derives from patriarch Abraham, a major biblical figure from ''The Old Testament'', which is recognized by Christians, Muslims and others.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |year=2010 |title=Philosophy of Religion |url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/497132/philosophy-of-religion |work=[[Encyclopædia Britannica]] |accessdate=24 June 2010 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100721151923/http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/497132/philosophy-of-religion |archivedate=21 July 2010  |deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Abrahamic religion spread globally through [[Christianity]] being adopted by the [[Roman Empire]] in the 4th century and [[Islam]] by the [[List of Muslim states and dynasties|Islamic Empires]] from the 7th century. Today the Abrahamic religions are one of the major divisions in [[comparative religion]] (along with [[Indian religions|Indian]], [[Iranian religions|Iranian]], and [[East Asian religions]]).&lt;ref name="Adams2"&gt;[http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-38030/classification-of-religions C.J.

== Etymology ==
[[File:Worldwide percentage of Adherents by Religion.png|thumb|450px|Major religious groups as a percentage of world population]]
It was suggested by Louis Massignon that the phrase "Abrahamic religion" means that all these religions come from one spiritual source.&lt;ref name="Massignon 1949" /&gt; [[Paul the Apostle]] referred to Abraham as the "father of us all".{{bibleref2c|Rom.|4}} There is a Quranic term, ''[[millat Ibrahim]]'', 'religion of Ibrahim',&lt;ref name="J.Smith98" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Anidjar2001" /&gt; indicating that Islam sees itself as standing in a tradition of religious practice from Abraham.&lt;ref&gt;The Quran, albaqarah; v. 135&lt;/ref&gt; Jewish tradition claims that the Jews are descended from Abraham, and adherents of Judaism derive their spiritual identity from Abraham as the first of the three "fathers" or [[Patriarchs (Bible)|biblical Patriarchs]]: Abraham, [[Isaac]], and [[Jacob]].

All the major Abrahamic religions claim a direct lineage to [[Abraham]], although in Christianity this is understood in spiritual terms:
* Abraham is recorded in the [[Torah]] as the ancestor of the [[Israelites]] through his son [[Isaac]], born to [[Sarah]] through a promise made in [[Book of Genesis|Genesis]].{{bibleref2c|Gen.|17:16}}&lt;ref&gt;Scherman, pp.&amp;nbsp;34–35.&lt;/ref&gt;
* Most Christians affirm the ancestral origin of the Jews in Abraham, but, as [[gentiles]], they consider themselves as grafted into the family tree under the [[New Covenant]]: see [[#For Christians|significance of Abraham for Christians]] for details.
* It is the Islamic tradition that Muhammad, as an [[Arabs|Arab]], is descended from Abraham's son [[Ishmael]]. Jewish tradition also equates the descendants of Ishmael, [[Ishmaelites]], with Arabs, while the descendants of Isaac by Jacob, who was also later known as Israel, are the Israelites.&lt;ref&gt;Saheeh al-Bukharee, Book 55, hadith no. 584; Book 56, hadith no. 710&lt;/ref&gt;
* The [[Báb]], regarded by Bahá'í's as a predecessor to Bahá'u'lláh, was a [[Sayyid]], or a direct descendant of Muhammad and thus traces his ancestry to Abraham's son Ishmael. Tradition also holds that [[Bahá'u'lláh]] is a descendant of Abraham through his third wife, [[Keturah]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |title=Part Four – On the Origin, Powers and Conditions of Man |url=http://www.bahai-library.com/writings/abdulbaha/saq/57.html |website=Bahai-library.com |accessdate=5 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Adam Dodds argues that the term "Abrahamic faiths", while helpful, can be considered misleading, as it conveys an unspecified historical and theological commonality that is problematic on closer examination. While there is commonality among the religions, in large measure their shared ancestry is peripheral to their respective foundational beliefs and thus conceals crucial differences.&lt;ref name="Dodds" /&gt; For example, the common Christian beliefs of [[Incarnation]], [[Trinity]] and the [[resurrection of Jesus]] are not accepted by Judaism or Islam (see for example [[Islamic view of Jesus' death]]). There are key beliefs in both Islam and Judaism that are not shared by most of Christianity (such as strict [[monotheism]] and [[religious law|adherence to Divine Law]]), and key beliefs of Islam, Christianity, and the Bahá'í Faith not shared by Judaism (such as the [[prophet]]ic and [[Messiah|Messianic]] position of [[Jesus and Messianic prophecy|Jesus]], respectively).&lt;ref&gt;Greenstreet, p.&amp;nbsp;95.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Challenges to term ==
The appropriateness of grouping Judaism, Christianity, and Islam by the terms "Abrahamic religions" or "Abrahamic traditions" has been challenged.

In 2012, Alan L. Berger, Professor of Judaic Studies at Florida Atlantic University,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://home.fau.edu/aberger/web/bio.htm |title=Dr. Alan L. Berger |website=Florida Atlantic University}}&lt;/ref&gt; in his Preface to ''Trialogue and Terror: Judaism, Christianity, and Islam after 9/11'' wrote that there are "commonalities", but "there are essential differences between the Abrahamic traditions" both "historical and theological". Although "Judaism birthed both Christianity and Islam", the "three monotheistic faiths went their separate ways". The three faiths "understand the role of Abraham" in "differing ways", and the relationships between Judaism and Christianity and between Judaism and Islam are "uneven". Also, the three traditions are "demographically unbalanced and ideologically diverse".&lt;ref&gt;Alan L. Berger, ed., ''Trialogue and Terror: Judaism, Christianity, and Islam after 9/11'' (Wipf and Stock Publishers, 2012), xiii.&lt;/ref&gt;

Also in 2012, [[Aaron W. Hughes]] published a book about the category Abrahamic religions as an example of "abuses of history." He said that only recently the category "Abrahamic religions" has come into use and that it is a "vague referent." It is "largely a theological neologism" and "an artificial and imprecise" term. Combining the Jewish, Christian, and Muslim religions into this one category might serve the purpose of encouraging "interfaith trialogue", but it is not true to the "historical record". Abrahamic religions is "an ahistorical category". There are "certain family resemblances" among these three religions, but the "amorphous" term Abrahamic religions prevents an understanding of the "complex nature" of the interactions among them. Furthermore, the three religions do not share the same story of Abraham. For these and other reasons, Hughes argued that the term should not be used, at least in academic circles.&lt;ref&gt;Aaron W. Hughes, ''Abrahamic Religions: On the Uses and Abuses of History'' (Oxford University Press, 2012), 3–4, 7–8, 17, 32.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Religions ==
=== Judaism ===
{{Main article|Jewish history}}
[[File:Skverer Rebbe With Torah.jpg|thumb|200px|A Jewish Rebbe holds Torah]]
One of Judaism's primary texts is the [[Tanakh]], an account of the [[Israelite]]s' relationship with God from their earliest history until the building of the [[Second Temple]] (c. 535 BCE). [[Abraham]] is hailed as the first [[Hebrews|Hebrew]] and the father of the [[Jews|Jewish people]]. One of his great-grandsons was [[Judah (Biblical person)|Judah]], from whom the religion ultimately gets its name. The Israelites were initially a number of tribes who lived in the [[Kingdom of Israel (united monarchy)|Kingdom of Israel]] and [[Kingdom of Judah]].

After being conquered and exiled, some members of the Kingdom of Judah eventually returned to Israel. They later formed an independent state under the [[Hasmonean dynasty]] in the 2nd and 1st centuries BCE, before becoming a client kingdom of the [[Roman Empire]], which also conquered the state and dispersed its inhabitants. From the 2nd to the 6th centuries Jews wrote the [[Talmud]], a lengthy work of legal rulings and Biblical exegesis which, along with the Tanakh, is a key text of Judaism.

=== Christianity ===
{{Main article|History of Christianity}}
[[File:Central Italian School 16th century Head of God the Father.jpg|thumb|200px|Central Italian School 16th century Head of God the Father]]
Christianity [[Christianity in the 1st century|began in the 1st century]] as a sect within Judaism initially led by Jesus. His followers viewed him as the [[Messiah]], as in the [[Confession of Peter]]; after his [[Crucifixion of Jesus|crucifixion]] and death they came to view him as [[Incarnation|God incarnate]],&lt;ref&gt;Pavlac, Brian A (2010). ''A Concise Survey of Western Civilization: Supremacies and Diversities''.  Chapter 6.&lt;/ref&gt; who was [[Resurrection of Jesus|resurrected]] and will [[Second Coming|return]] at the end of time to [[Last Judgment|judge the living and the dead]] and create an eternal [[Kingdom of God]]. Within a few decades the new movement [[Split of early Christianity and Judaism|split from Judaism]].

After several periods of alternating persecution and relative peace ''vis a vis'' the Roman authorities under different administrations, Christianity became the [[state church of the Roman Empire]] in 380, but has been [[Early centers of Christianity|split into various churches from its beginning]]. An attempt was made by the [[Byzantine Empire]] to unify [[Christendom]], but this formally failed with the [[East–West Schism]] of 1054. In the 16th century, the birth and growth of Protestantism further split Christianity into many denominations.

=== Islam ===
{{Main article|History of Islam}}
[[File:Abraham tomb.JPG|thumb|200px|The tomb of [[Abraham]], a [[cenotaph]] above the [[Cave of the Patriarchs]] traditionally considered to be the burial place of Abraham.]]
Islam is based on the teachings of the [[Quran]]. Although it considers Muhammad to be the [[Seal of the prophets]], Islam teaches that every [[Prophets in Islam|prophet]] preached Islam, providing a historical back-story for the religion by independently recognizing Jewish and Christian prophets, and adding others. The teachings of Quran are presented as the direct revelation and words of [[Allah]]. Islam (meaning "submission", in the sense of submission to God) is universal (membership is open to anyone); like Judaism, it has a strictly unitary conception of God, called ''[[tawhid]]'', or "strict" or "simple" monotheism.&lt;ref name="BBCIslam"&gt;[http://www.bbc.co.uk/religion/religions/islam/ataglance/glance.shtml Religions » Islam » Islam at a glance], BBC, 5 August 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Other Abrahamic religions ===
Historically, the Abrahamic religions have been considered to be Judaism, Christianity and Islam. Some of this is due to the age and larger size of these three. The other, similar religions were seen as either too new to judge as being truly in the same class, or too small to be of significance to the category.

However, some of the restriction of Abrahamic to these three is due only to tradition in historical classification. Therefore, restricting the category to these three religions has come under criticism.&lt;ref name="trialogue"&gt;*{{cite web| last = Micksch | first = Jürgen | title = Trialog International – Die jährliche Konferenz | publisher = Herbert Quandt Stiftung |year=2009 |url=http://www.herbert-quandt-stiftung.de/root/index.php?lang=de&amp;page_id=885 |accessdate=19 September 2009}}

==== Bahá'í Faith ====
{{Main article|Bahá'í Faith}}
[[File:Bahai star.svg|thumb|110px|Nine-point star of Bahá'í Faith]]

Though smaller and younger than the well-known Abrahamic religions, the Bahá'í Faith is significant because of its activities, distribution and numbers. The religion is almost entirely contained in a single, organized community with international, national, regional, and local administration, without sects or subdivisions, and is recognized as the second-most geographically widespread religion after Christianity.&lt;ref name="britannica_stats_b"&gt;{{Cite book |chapter=Worldwide Adherents of All Religions by Six Continental Areas, Mid-2002 |title=Encyclopædia Britannica |author=Encyclopædia Britannica |publisher=Encyclopædia Britannica |year=2002 |isbn=978-0-85229-555-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |first=Denis |last=MacEoin |chapter=Baha'i Faith |editor=Hinnells, John R. |title=The New Penguin Handbook of Living Religions: Second Edition |publisher=[[Penguin books|Penguin]] |year=2000 |isbn=978-0-14-051480-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Association of Religion Data Archives]] estimated some 7.3&amp;nbsp;million Bahá'ís in 2005&lt;ref name="WCE-05"&gt;{{cite web |title=World Religions (2005) |work=QuickLists – The World – Religions |publisher=The Association of Religion Data Archives |year=2005 |url=http://www.thearda.com/QuickLists/QuickList_125.asp |accessdate=4 July 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the only religion to consistently surpass population growth in each major region of the planet over the last century, often growing at twice the rate of the population.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Johnson |first=Todd M. |author2=Brian J.

====  Bábism ====
{{Main article|Bábism}}Bábism{{sfnp|''EB''|1911}} ({{lang-fa|بابیه}}, ''Babiyye''), also known as the Bayání Faith&lt;ref&gt;This has been the standard term which the modern followers of Bábism have adopted in order to identify themselves, however it has not been popular within scholarship, modern and contemporary to the religion's founders, the majority of scholars—such as Browne for instance—choosing to refer to the religion as Bábism or the Bábí Faith&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Varnava, Andrekos, Nicholas Coureas, and Marina Elia, eds. The Minorities of Cyprus: Development patterns and the identity of the internal-exclusion. Cambridge Scholars Publishing, 2009. p.&amp;nbsp;362&lt;/ref&gt; ([[Arabic]]: {{Lang|ar|بيانة}}, ''Bayání''), is an Abrahamic [[Monotheism|monotheistic]] religion which professes that there is one incorporeal, unknown, and incomprehensible God&lt;ref&gt;[[Báb|Báb, The]] (1848). [http://www.h-net.org/~bahai/trans/bayan/bayan.htm ''Persian Bayán''], Exordium.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="browne15"&gt;[[Edward Granville Browne|Browne, E.G.]] [https://www.h-net.org/~bahai/areprint/nk/n-q-p-5.pdf ''Kitab-i-Nuqtatu'l-Kaf''], p.&amp;nbsp;15&lt;/ref&gt; who manifests his will in an unending series of [[Theophany|theophanies]], called Manifestations of God (Arabic: {{Lang|ar|ظهور الله}}). It is an extremely small religion, with no more than a few thousand adherents according to current estimates, most of which are concentrated in Iran.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia | title = Azali | encyclopedia = Britannica Concise Encyclopedia | volume = 2006 | publisher = Encyclopædia Britannica | url = http://concise.britannica.com/ebc/article-9356264/Azali | accessdate = 26 December 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Barret (2001), p.&amp;nbsp;246&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |encyclopedia= Encyclopædia Iranica |year= 1989 |article=Azali Babism | first = Dennis | last = MacEoin | url = http://www.iranica.com/newsite/articles/v3f2/v3f2a070.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was founded by [[Báb|‘Ali Muhammad Shirazi]] who first assumed the title of [[Bab (gateway)|Báb]] ({{abbr|lit.|literally}}&amp;nbsp;"Gate") from which the religion gets its name, out of the belief that he was the gate to the [[Twelfth Imam]].&lt;ref name="saiedi19"&gt;{{cite book | title = Gate of the Heart | first = Nader | last = Saiedi | publisher = Wilfrid Laurier University Press | location = Waterloo, ON |page=19 | isbn = 978-1-55458-035-4 | year = 2008 | url = https://books.google.com/?id=XTfoaK15t64C&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=Understanding+the+Writings+of+the+B%C3%A1b&amp;cd=1#v=onepage&amp;q=}}&lt;/ref&gt; However throughout his ministry his titles and claims underwent much evolution as the Báb progressively outlined his teachings.&lt;ref name="evlambden"&gt;Lambden, Stephen. [http://hurqalya.ucmerced.edu/node/2971 The Evolving Clains and Titles of Mirza `Ali Muhammad Shirazi, the Bab (1819–1850 CE)]&lt;/ref&gt;

Founded in 1844, Bábism flourished in [[Persian Empire|Persia]] until 1852, then lingered on in exile in the [[Ottoman Empire]], especially [[Cyprus]], as well as underground. An anomaly amongst Islamic messianic movements, the Bábí movement signaled a break with Islam, beginning a new religious system with its own unique laws, teachings, and practices. While Bábism was violently opposed by both clerical and government establishments, it led to the founding of the Bahá'í Faith, whose followers consider the religion founded by the Báb as a predecessor to their own.

====  Samaritanism ====
Samaritanism is based on some of the same books used as the basis of Judaism but differs from the latter. Samaritan religious works include the [[Samaritan Pentateuch|Samaritan version of the Torah]], the Memar Markah, the Samaritan liturgy, and Samaritan law codes and biblical commentaries. Many{{who|date=April 2017}} claim the Samaritans appear to have a text of the Torah as old as the [[Masoretic Text]]; scholars have various theories concerning the actual relationships between these three texts.

====  Yazdânism (the Yezidi, Yarsani and Alevi faiths) ====
Yazdânism, or the Cult of Angels, is a proposed pre-Islamic, [[native religion]] of the [[Kurds#religion|Kurds]]. The term was introduced by Kurdish scholar [[Mehrdad Izady]] to represent what he considers the "original" religion of the Kurds&lt;ref name="Foltz 219"&gt;{{cite book |first=Richard |last=Foltz |chapter=Two Kurdish Sects: The Yezidis and the Yaresan |title=Religions of Iran: From Prehistory to the Present |isbn=978-1-78074-307-3 |chapter-url=https://www.academia.edu/9387407 |page=219 |registration=yes|date=2013-10-22 }}&lt;/ref&gt; as the primary inhabitants of the [[Zagros Mountains]], until their increasing [[Islamization]] in the course of the 10th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.gov.krd/a/d.aspxr=61&amp;l=12&amp;a=40&amp;s=&amp;s=010000|title=Kurdish History and Culture|last=Izady|first=M. R.|date=December 2004|website=Kurdistan Regional Government|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Izady, Yazdânism is now continued in the denominations of Yazidism, Yarsanism, and Alevism.&lt;ref&gt;Izady, 1992. pp.&amp;nbsp;170 passim&lt;/ref&gt; The three traditions subsumed under the term Yazdânism are primarily practiced in relatively isolated communities, from [[Khorasan Province|Khurasan]] to [[Anatolia]] and parts of western Iran.

The concept of Yazdânism has found a wide perception both within and beyond [[Kurdish nationalism|Kurdish nationalist]] discourses, but has been disputed by other recognized scholars of [[Iranian religions]]. Well established, however, are the "striking" and "unmistakable" similarities between the [[Yazidis]] and the Yaresan or ''Ahl-e Haqq'',{{sfn|Kreyenbroek|1995|pages=54; 59}} some of which can be traced back to elements of an ancient faith that was probably dominant among [[Western Iranian languages|Western Iranians]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Foltz|first1=Richard|title=Two Kurdish Sects: The Yezidis and the Yaresan|pages=219|url=https://www.academia.edu/9387407|access-date=7 December 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150204071202/http://www.academia.edu/9387407/Religions_of_Iran_From_Prehistory_to_the_Present|archive-date=4 February 2015|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; and likened to practices of pre-Zoroastrian [[Mithra]]ic religion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Richard |last=Foltz |chapter=Mithra and Mithraism |title=Religions of Iran: From Prehistory to the Present |isbn=978-1-78074-307-3 |chapter-url=https://www.academia.edu/9387407 |page=30 |registration=yes|date=2013-10-22 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Mehrdad Izady defines the Yazdanism as an ancient [[Hurrians|Hurrian]] religion and states that [[Mitanni]]s could have introduced some of the [[Vedic]] tradition that appears to be manifest in Yazdanism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Exploring Kurdish Origins|url=http://www.kurdistanica.com/?q=node/74}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====  Shabakism  ====
[[Shabakism]] is the name given to the beliefs and practices of the [[Shabak people]] of [[Kurdistan region]] and around [[Mosul]] in [[Iraq]]. A majority of Shabaks regard themselves as Shia, and a minority identify as [[Sunni Islam|Sunnis]].&lt;ref name="aina"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aina.org/news/20140721084628.htm|title=Iraq: The Minorities of the Nineveh Plain|author=Mina al-Lami|date=21 August 2014|accessdate=9 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.niqash.org/en/articles/society/2219/|title=The Shabak Search for Identity|first=Adel|last=Kamal|website=Niqash.org|accessdate=1 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-middle-east-28351073|title=Iraq: The minorities of Nineveh|first=Mina|last=al-Lami|date=21 July 2014|accessdate=1 August 2018|newspaper=BBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://nonprofitquarterly.org/2016/07/07/iraqs-religious-ethnic-minorities-disappearing-due-isis-violence-global-inaction/|title=Iraq's Religious, Ethnic Minorities Disappearing Due to ISIS Violence and Global Inaction - Non Profit News - Nonprofit Quarterly|website=nonprofitquarterly.org|accessdate=1 August 2018|date=2016-07-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite this, their actual faith and rituals differ from Islam, and have characteristics that make them distinct from neighboring [[Muslim]] populations. These include features from Christianity including [[Confession (religion)|confession]], and the consumption of [[alcohol (drug)|alcohol]], and the fact that Shabaks often go on pilgrimage to [[Yazidi]] shrines.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://i-cias.com/e.o/shabak.religion.htm|title=Shabak / Religion – LookLex Encyclopaedia|first=Tore|last=Kjeilen|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, the Shabak people also go on pilgrimages to Shia holy cities such as [[Najaf]] and [[Karbala]], and follow many Shiite teachings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Imranali Panjwani|title=Shi'a of Samarra: The Heritage and Politics of a Community in Iraq|page=172}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The organization of Shabakism appears to be much like that of a [[Sufi order]]: adult laymen ([[Murid]]s) are bound to spiritual guides ([[Pir (Sufism)|pîrs]] or [[Murshid]]s) who are knowledgeable in matters of religious doctrine and ritual. There are several ranks of such pîrs; at the top stands the Baba, or supreme head of the order. Theoretically individuals can choose their own pîr, but in practice the pir families often become associated with lay families over several generations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kurdishacademy.org/?q=node/133|title=The Shabak and the Kakais - Kurdish Academy of Language|website=Kurdishacademy.org|accessdate=1 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Shabakism combines elements of [[Sufism]] with the uniquely Shabak interpretation of "divine reality." According to Shabaks, this divine reality supersedes the literal, or [[Shar'ia]], interpretation of the [[Quran]]. Shabaks comprehend divine reality through the mediation of the "Pir" or spiritual guide, who also performs Shabak rituals.&lt;ref name="AVino"&gt;A. Vinogradov, "Ethnicity, Cultural Discontinuity and Power Brokers in Northern Iraq: The Case of the Shabak", ''American Ethnologist'', pp.&amp;nbsp;214–215, [[American Anthropological Association]], 1974. {{doi|10.1525/ae.1974.1.1.02a00110}}. {{JSTOR|643810}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The structure of these mediatory relationships closely resembles that of the Yarsan.&lt;ref name=KaW&gt;{{cite web|url=http://kurdishacademy.org/?q=node%2F133|title=The Shabak and the Kakais|first=Michiel|last=Leezenberg|accessdate=2 November 2014|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160412221746/http://kurdishacademy.org/?q=node%2F133|archivedate=12 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The primary Shabak religious text is the [[Buyruk (Shabak)|Buyruk]] or ''Kitab al-Managib'' (Book of Exemplary Acts) and is written in [[Iraqi Turkmens#Language|Turkoman]].&lt;ref name=KaW/&gt;&lt;ref name=vIk&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aina.org/news/20050816114539.htm|title=Kurdish Gunmen Open Fire on Demonstrators in North Iraq|date=16 August 2005|accessdate=7 October 2014|author=Assyrian News Agency|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303224028/http://www.aina.org/news/20050816114539.htm|archivedate=3 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Shabaks also consider the poetry of [[Ismail I]] to be revealed by God, and they recite Ismail's poetry during religious meetings.&lt;ref name="AVino" /&gt;

====  Mandeanism ====
[[Mandaeism]] or Mandaeanism ({{lang-ar|مندائية}} ''{{transl|ar|ALA-LC|Mandāʼīyah}}'') is a [[Gnosticism|gnostic]] religion&lt;ref name="Mandaens"&gt;{{citation|last=Buckley|first=Jorunn Jacobsen|title=The Mandaeans: ancient texts and modern people|year=2002|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=9780195153859|url=http://mandaeannetwork.com/Mandaean/books/english/2The_Mandaeans_Ancient_Texts_and_Modern_People_American_Academy_of_Religion_Books_Jorunn_Jacobsen_Buckley.pdf?bcsi_scan_955b0cd764557e80=0&amp;bcsi_scan_filename=2The_Mandaeans_Ancient_Texts_and_Modern_People_American_Academy_of_Religion_Books_Jorunn_Jacobsen_Buckley.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|4}} with a strongly [[Dualistic cosmology|dualistic]] worldview. Its adherents, the [[Mandaeans]], revere [[Adam]], [[Cain and Abel|Abel]], [[Seth]], [[Enos (biblical figure)|Enos]], [[Noah]], [[Shem]], [[Aram, son of Shem|Aram]], and especially [[John the Baptist]]. Abraham, however, is considered a false prophet in Mandeanism.&lt;ref&gt;Lupieri, Edmondo. (Charles Hindley, trans.) 2002. ''The Mandaeans: The Last Gnostics'', p.166. Grand Rapids, MI: Wm. B.

The Druze faith is a [[monotheistic]] and [[Abrahamic religion]] based on the teachings of high Islamic figures like [[Hamza ibn-'Ali ibn-Ahmad]] and [[Al-Hakim bi-Amr Allah]], and Greek [[philosophy|philosophers]] such as [[Plato]] and [[Aristotle]].&lt;ref name="Entrepreneurship and Religion"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Léo-Paul Dana|title=Entrepreneurship and Religion|date=1 January 2010|publisher=[[Edward Elgar Publishing]]|isbn=978-1-84980-632-9|page=314}}&lt;!--|accessdate=6 January 2015--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Adams Media"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Terri Morrison|author2=Wayne A.

The Druze Faith is often classified as a branch of Isma'ili Shia Islam.

====  Rastafari====
Rastafari, sometimes termed Rastafarianism, is an [[Abrahamic religion|Abrahamic]] [[religion]]. Classified as both a [[new religious movement]] and [[social movement]], it developed in [[Jamaica]] during the 1930s. It lacks any centralised authority and there is much heterogeneity among practitioners, who are known as Rastafari, Rastafarians, or Rastas.

Rastafari refer to their beliefs, which are based on a specific interpretation of the [[Bible]], as "Rastalogy". Central is a [[monotheistic]] belief in a single God—referred to as [[Jah]]—who partially resides within each individual. The former emperor of Ethiopia, [[Haile Selassie]], is given central importance. Many Rastas regard him as an incarnation of Jah on Earth and as the [[Second Coming of Christ]].  Others regard him as a human prophet who fully recognised the inner divinity within every individual. Rastafari is [[Afrocentrism|Afrocentric]] and focuses its attention on the [[African diaspora]], which it believes is oppressed within Western society, or "Babylon". Many Rastas call for the resettlement of the African diaspora in either Ethiopia or Africa more widely, referring to this continent as the [[Promised Land]] of "Zion". Other interpretations shift focus on to the adoption of an Afrocentric attitude while living outside of Africa. Rastas refer to their practices as "livity". Communal meetings are known as "groundations", and are typified by music, chanting, discussions, and the [[Entheogenic use of cannabis|smoking of cannabis]], the latter being regarded as a [[sacrament]] with beneficial properties. Rastas place emphasis on what they regard as living 'naturally', adhering to [[ital]] dietary requirements, allowing their hair to form into [[dreadlocks]], and following [[patriarchy|patriarchal]] gender roles.

Rastafari originated among impoverished and socially disenfranchised [[Afro-Jamaican]] communities in 1930s Jamaica. Its Afrocentric ideology was largely a reaction against Jamaica's then-dominant [[Colony of Jamaica|British colonial culture]]. It was influenced by both [[Ethiopian movement|Ethiopianism]] and the [[Back-to-Africa movement]] promoted by [[black nationalism|black nationalist]] figures like [[Marcus Garvey]]. The movement developed after several Christian clergymen, most notably [[Leonard Howell]], proclaimed that the crowning of Haile Selassie as Emperor of Ethiopia in 1930 fulfilled a Biblical prophecy. By the 1950s, Rastafari's [[counter-culture|counter-cultural]] stance had brought the movement into conflict with wider Jamaican society, including violent clashes with law enforcement. In the 1960s and 1970s it gained increased respectability within Jamaica and greater visibility abroad through the popularity of Rasta-inspired [[reggae]] musicians like [[Bob Marley]]. Enthusiasm for Rastafari declined in the 1980s, following the deaths of Haile Selassie and Marley.

The Rasta movement is organised on a largely cellular basis. There are several denominations, or "[[Mansions of Rastafari]]", the most prominent of which are the [[Nyahbinghi]], [[Bobo Ashanti]], [[Ethiopian Zion Coptic Church]], and the [[Twelve Tribes of Israel (Rastafari)|Twelve Tribes of Israel]], each of which offers different interpretations of Rasta belief. There are an estimated 700,000 to 1 million Rastas across the world; the largest population is in Jamaica although communities can be found in most of the world's major population centres.

== Abrahamic ethno-religious groups ==
Some small religions, such as [[Samaritanism]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |  title = Introduction to Judaism Classroom Materials| publisher = Jewish Museum of Maryland | year = 2007| url =http://www.jhsm.org/sites/default/files/IntroductiontoJudaismcurriculum2007_000.pdf |format=PDF |accessdate=19 September 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Druze]],&lt;ref name="Druze2"/&gt; [[Rastafari movement]],&lt;ref name="christianity-guide" /&gt; and the [[Bábí Faith]], are Abrahamic.

== Origins and history ==
{{See also|Ancient Canaanite religion|Yahweh|Religion in pre-Islamic Arabia}}
The civilizations that developed in [[Mesopotamia]] influenced some religious texts, particularly the [[Hebrew Bible]] and the [[Book of Genesis]] in particular; Abraham is said to have originated in Mesopotamia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Bertman|first1=Stephen|title=Handbook to life in ancient Mesopotamia|date=2005|publisher=Oxford Univ. Press|location=Oxford [u.a.]|isbn=978-0195183641|page=312|edition=Paperback}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Judaism regards itself as the religion of the descendants of Jacob,&lt;ref group="n"&gt;Jacob is also called Israel, a name the [[Bible]] states he was given by God.&lt;/ref&gt; a grandson of Abraham. It has a [[God in Judaism|strictly unitary]] view of God, and the central holy book for almost all branches is the [[Masoretic Text]] as elucidated in the [[Oral Torah]]. In the 19th century and 20th centuries Judaism developed a small number of branches, of which the most significant are [[Orthodox Judaism|Orthodox]], [[Conservative Judaism|Conservative]], and [[Reform Judaism|Reform]].

Christianity began as a [[Jewish Christian|sect of Judaism]]&lt;ref group="n"&gt;cf. [[Judaizer]], [[Messianic Judaism]]&lt;/ref&gt; in the [[Mediterranean Basin]]&lt;ref group="n"&gt;With several centers, such as [[Early centers of Christianity#Rome|Rome]], [[Early centers of Christianity#Jerusalem|Jerusalem]], [[Early centers of Christianity#Alexandria|Alexandria]], [[Early centers of Christianity#Greece|Thessaloniki and Corinth]], [[Early centers of Christianity#Antioch|Antioch]], and later spread outwards, eventually having two main centers in the empire, one for the [[Western Church]] and one for the [[Eastern Church]] in Rome and [[Constantinople]] respectively by the [[Christianity in the 5th century|5th century CE]]&lt;/ref&gt; of the first century [[Common Era|CE]] and [[Split of early Christianity and Judaism|evolved into a separate religion]]—Christianity—with distinctive beliefs and practices. [[Jesus in Christianity|Jesus]] is the central figure of Christianity, considered by almost all denominations to be [[God the Son]], one [[Hypostasis (philosophy and religion)|person]] of the [[Trinity]]. See [[God in Christianity]].&lt;ref group="n"&gt;[[Trinity|Triune God]] is also called the "Holy Trinity"&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Christian biblical canons]] are usually held to be the ultimate authority, alongside [[sacred tradition]] in some [[Christian denomination|denominations]] (such as the [[Catholic Church]] and the [[Eastern Orthodox Church]]). Over many centuries, Christianity divided into three main branches (Orthodox, Catholic, and [[Protestantism|Protestant]]), [[List of Christian denominations|dozens of significant denominations]], and hundreds of smaller ones.

Islam arose in the [[Arabian Peninsula]]&lt;ref group="n"&gt;Islam arose specifically in [[Tihamah]] city of [[Mecca]] and [[Hejaz]] city of [[Medina]] of Arabia&lt;/ref&gt; in the 7th century CE with a [[God in Islam|strictly unitary view of God]].&lt;ref group="n"&gt;The monotheistic view of God in Islam is called ''[[tawhid]]'' which is essentially the same as the conception of God in Judaism&lt;/ref&gt; [[Muslim]]s hold the Quran to be the ultimate authority, as revealed and elucidated through the [[Sunnah|teachings and practices]]&lt;ref group="n"&gt;Teachings and practices of Muhammad are collectively known as the ''[[sunnah]]'', similar to the [[Halakha|Judaic concepts of oral law]] and [[exegesis]], or ''[[talmud]]'' and ''[[midrash]]''&lt;/ref&gt; of a central, but not divine prophet, [[Muhammad]]. The Islamic faith considers all [[Prophets and messengers in Islam|prophets and messengers]] from [[Adam]] through the final messenger (Muhammad) to carry the same Islamic monotheistic principles. Soon after its founding, Islam split into two main branches (Sunni and Shia Islam), each of which now has a number of denominations.

The Bahá'í Faith began within the context of Shia Islam in 19th-century Persia, after a merchant named [[Báb|Siyyid `Alí Muḥammad Shírází]] claimed divine revelation and took on the title of the Báb, or "the Gate". The Bab's ministry proclaimed the imminent advent of "[[He whom God shall make manifest]]", who Bahá'í's accept as [[Bahá'u'lláh]]. Bahá'í's revere the Torah, Gospels and the Quran, and the writings of the Báb, Bahá'u'lláh, and `Abdu’l-Bahá' are considered the central texts of the faith. A vast majority of adherents are unified under a single denomination.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |title=The Bahá'í Faith – The website of the worldwide Bahá'í community |url=http://www.bahai.org |website=Bahai.org |accessdate=5 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Lesser-known Abrahamic religions, originally offshoots of Shia Islam, include Bábism&lt;ref group="n"&gt;Historically, the Bahá'í Faith arose in 19th-century Persia, in the context of Shia Islam, and thus may be classed on this basis as a divergent strand of Islam, placing it in the Abrahamic tradition. However, the Bahá'í Faith considers itself an independent religious tradition, which arose from a Muslim context but also recognizes other traditions. The Bahá'í Faith may also be classed as a [[new religious movement]], due to its comparatively recent origin, or may be considered sufficiently old and established for such classification to not be applicable.&lt;/ref&gt; and the Druze faith.&lt;ref&gt;* {{cite news |last=Dolbee |first=Sandi |title=Faith, Hope and Understand: Teenagers Questions and learn about each other's Faiths |newspaper=The San Diego Union–Tribune |page=E.1 |date=27 March 2003 |url=https://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/sandiego/access/319404861.html?dids=319404861:319404861&amp;FMT=ABS&amp;FMTS=ABS:FT&amp;type=current&amp;date=Mar+27%2C+2003&amp;author=Sandi+Dolbee&amp;pub=The+San+Diego+Union+-+Tribune&amp;edition=&amp;startpage=E.1&amp;desc=FAITH%2C+HOPE+AND+UNDERSTAND+%7C+TEENAGERS+QUESTIONS+AND+LEARN+ABOUT+EACH+OTHER%27S+FAITHS |accessdate=3 March 2012}}

== Common aspects ==
The unifying characteristic of Abrahamic religions is that all accept the tradition that [[God in Abrahamic religions|God]] revealed himself to the patriarch Abraham.&lt;ref name="Peters" /&gt; All are monotheistic, and conceive God to be a [[Transcendence (religion)|transcendent]] [[Creator deity|creator]] and the source of [[Morality|moral law]].&lt;ref&gt;

In these four{{which?|date=October 2018}} Abrahamic religions the individual, God, and the universe are highly separate from each other. The Abrahamic religions believe in a judging, paternal, fully external god to which the individual and nature are subordinate. One seeks [[salvation]] or transcendence not by contemplating the natural world or via philosophical speculation, but by seeking to please God (such as obedience with God's wishes or his law) and see [[divine revelation]] as outside of self, nature, and custom.

=== Monotheism ===
{{Main article|Monotheism}}
All Abrahamic religions claim to be monotheistic, worshiping an exclusive God, although one known by different names.&lt;ref name="Peters"&gt;{{Cite book |last= Peters |first= Francis E. |authorlink= Francis E.

Since the conception of a divine Trinity is not amenable to ''[[tawhid]]'', the Islamic doctrine of monotheism, Islam regards Christianity as variously [[polytheism|polytheistic]] &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://uwaterloo.ca/grebel/sites/ca.grebel/files/uploads/files/IslamicMonotheismandtheTrinity.pdf|title=Islamic Monotheism and the Trinity|last=Hoover|first=Jon|date=|website=University of Waterloo|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

Christianity, Islam, and the Bahá'í Faith each revere Jesus ([[Arabic language|Arabic]]: ''[[Jesus in Islam|Isa]]'' or ''Yasu'' among Muslims and [[Arab Christians]] respectively) but with vastly differing conceptions:
* Christians view Jesus as the [[Redeemer (Christianity)|saviour]] (and most Christians also regard him as [[Incarnation|God incarnate]]).
* Muslims see Isa as a [[Prophet of Islam]]&lt;ref name="EoQP"&gt;Uri Rubin, ''Prophets and Prophethood'', ''[[Encyclopaedia of the Qur'an]]''&lt;/ref&gt; and Messiah.
* Bahá'í's rank Jesus as the Messiah and as a [[Manifestation of God]] (not as God incarnate, but as the presence of God).&lt;ref&gt;

}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

However, the worship of Jesus, or the ascribing of partners to God (known as ''[[Shirk (Islam)|shirk]]'' in Islam and as ''[[shituf]]'' in Judaism), is typically viewed as the [[heresy]] of [[idolatry]] by Islam and Judaism and as misguided by the Bahá'ís. Judaism, Islam, and the Bahá'í Faith also see the incarnation of God into human form as a heresy.{{citation needed|date=April 2017}}

=== Theological continuity ===
{{See also|Messianism}}
All the Abrahamic religions affirm one eternal God who created the universe, who rules history, who sends [[prophecy|prophetic]] and angelic messengers and who reveals the [[divine law|divine will]] through inspired [[revelation]]. They also affirm that obedience to this [[creator deity]] is to be lived out historically and that one day God will unilaterally intervene in human history at the [[Last Judgment]].{{citation needed|date=February 2016}}

=== Scripture ===
{{See also|Development of the Hebrew Bible canon|Development of the Christian biblical canon|History of the Quran}}
All Abrahamic religions believe that God guides humanity through [[revelation]] to prophets, and each religion recognizes that God revealed teachings up to and including those in their own scripture.

=== Ethical orientation ===
{{See also|Ethical monotheism}}
An [[Ethics|ethical]] orientation: all these religions speak of a choice between good and evil, which is associated with obedience or disobedience to a single God and to [[Divine Law]].

=== Eschatological world view ===
An [[eschatology|eschatological]] world view of history and destiny, beginning with the [[Creation myth|creation]] of the world and the concept that God works through history, and ending with a [[resurrection of the dead]] and [[Last Judgment|final judgment]] and [[world to come]].&lt;ref&gt;Wiener, Philip P.

Kenan, Jr., professor of the history of Christianity at the [[University of Virginia]], Charlottesville, writes that from the middle of the 4th century to the [[Islamic conquests|Islamic conquest]] in the middle of the 7th century, the [[Syria Palaestina|Roman province of Palestine]] was a Christian nation with Jerusalem its principal city.&lt;ref name=Wilken/&gt; According to the [[New Testament]], Jerusalem was the city Jesus was brought to as a child to be presented at the temple{{Bibleref2c|Luke|2:22}} and for the feast of the [[Passover]].{{Bibleref2c|Luke|2:41}} He preached and healed in Jerusalem, unceremoniously drove the [[Jesus and the money changers|money changers]] in disarray from the temple there, held the [[Last Supper]] in an "upper room" (traditionally the [[Cenacle]]) there the night before he is said to have died on the cross, was arrested in [[Gethsemane]]. The six parts to Jesus' trial—three stages in a religious court and three stages before a Roman court—were all held in Jerusalem. His [[crucifixion]] at [[Calvary|Golgotha]], his burial nearby (traditionally the [[Church of the Holy Sepulchre]]), and his resurrection and ascension and [[Second Coming|prophecy to return]] all are said to have occurred or will occur there.

Jerusalem became holy to Muslims, third after [[Mecca]] and [[Medina]]. The [[Al-Aqsa Mosque]], which translates to "farthest mosque" in [[sura]] [[Al-Isra]] in the Quran and its surroundings are addressed in the Quran as "the holy land". Muslim tradition as recorded in the [[ahadith]] identifies al-Aqsa with a mosque in Jerusalem. The first Muslims did not pray toward [[Kaaba]], but toward Jerusalem (this was the ''[[qibla]]'' for 13 years): the qibla was switched to Kaaba later on to fulfill the order of Allah of praying in the direction of Kaaba (Quran, Al-Baqarah 2:144–150). Another reason for its significance is its connection with the [[Isra and Mi'raj|Miʿrāj]],&lt;ref name="Miraj"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/384897/Miraj,|title=Mi'raj – Islam|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; where, according to traditional Muslim, Muhammad ascended through the [[Seven heavens]] on a winged mule named [[Buraq]], guided by the [[Archangel Gabriel]], beginning from the [[Foundation Stone]] on the [[Temple Mount]], in modern times under the [[Dome of the Rock]].&lt;ref name="Britannica_J"&gt;[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/302812/Jerusalem "Jerusalem (Britannica)"], ''Jerusalem(Britannica)''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="AlAqsa"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/30995/Al-Aqsa-Mosque|title=Al-Aqsa Mosque – mosque, Jerusalem|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Significance of Abraham ===

[[File:Greater Israel map.jpg|thumb|350px|An interpretation of the borders (in red) of the [[Promised Land]], based on God's promise to [[Abraham]] (Genesis 15:18).{{bibleref2c|Genesis|15|HE}}]]
Even though members of Judaism, Christianity, and Islam do not all claim Abraham as an ancestor, some members of these religions have tried to claim him as exclusively theirs.&lt;ref name="Lubar"&gt;{{cite web |title=Why 'Abrahamic'? |publisher=Lubar Institute for Religious Studies at [[University of Wisconsin - Madison]] |year=2007 |url=http://lisar.lss.wisc.edu/welcome/Why%20Abrahamic.html |accessdate=15 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For [[Jews]], Abraham is the founding [[Patriarchs (Bible)|patriarch]] of the children of Israel. God promised Abraham: "I will make of you a great nation, and I will bless you."{{Bibleref2c|Gen.|12:2}} With Abraham, God entered into "an everlasting covenant throughout the ages to be God to you and to your offspring to come".{{Bibleref2c|Gen.|17:7}} It is this covenant that makes Abraham and his descendants children of the covenant. Similarly, converts, who join the covenant, are all identified as sons and daughters of Abraham.{{Citation needed|date = April 2018}}

Abraham is primarily a revered ancestor or [[patriarch]] (referred to as ''Avraham Avinu'' (אברהם אבינו in [[Hebrew]]) "Abraham our father") to whom God made several promises: chiefly, that he would have numberless descendants, who would receive the land of Canaan (the "[[Promised Land]]"). According to Jewish tradition, Abraham was the first post-[[Genesis flood narrative|Flood]] prophet to reject [[idolatry]] through rational analysis, although [[Shem]] and [[Eber]] carried on the tradition from [[Noah]].&lt;ref&gt;Shultz, Joseph P. "Two Views of the Patriarchs", in Nahum Norbert Glatzer, Michael A. Fishbane, Paul R. Mendes-Flohr (eds.) (1975). ''Texts and Responses: Studies presented to Nahum N. Glatzer on the occasion of his 70th birthday by his students''. [[Brill Publishers]]. pp.&amp;nbsp;51–52. {{ISBN|9789004039803}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Aryeh Kaplan|Kaplan, Aryeh]] (1973). "The Jew". ''The Aryeh Kaplan Reader''. [[Mesorah Publications]]. p.&amp;nbsp;161. {{ISBN|9780899061733}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Abraham#Christianity|Christians view Abraham]] as an important exemplar of [[Faith in Christianity|faith]], and a spiritual, as well as physical, ancestor of Jesus. For Christians, Abraham is a spiritual forebear as well as/rather than a direct ancestor depending on the [[Paul the Apostle and Judaism|individual's interpretation of Paul the Apostle]],{{bibleref2c|Rom.|4:9–12}} with the [[Abrahamic covenant]] "reinterpreted so as to be defined by faith in Christ rather than biological descent" or both by faith as well as a direct ancestor; in any case, the emphasis is placed on faith being the only requirement for the Abrahamic Covenant to apply&lt;ref&gt;Blasi, Turcotte, Duhaime, p.&amp;nbsp;592.&lt;/ref&gt; (see also [[New Covenant]] and [[supersessionism]]). In Christian belief, Abraham is a [[role model]] of faith,{{bibleref2c|Heb.|11:8–10}}{{primary source inline|date=August 2017}} and his obedience to God by [[Binding of Isaac|offering Isaac]] is seen as a [[foreshadowing]] of God's offering of his son Jesus.{{bibleref2c|Rom.|8:32}}&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | last = MacArthur | first = John | authorlink = John F.

Christian commentators have a tendency to interpret God's promises to Abraham as applying to Christianity subsequent to, and sometimes rather than (as in supersessionism), being applied to Judaism, whose adherents [[Rejection of Jesus|rejected Jesus]]. They argue this on the basis that just as Abraham as a [[Gentile]] (before he was [[Circumcision controversy in early Christianity|circumcised]]) "believed God and it was credited to him as righteousness" {{bibleref2c|Gen.|15:6}} (cf. Rom. 4:3, James 2:23), "those who have faith are children of Abraham" {{bibleref2c|Gal.|3:7}} (see also John 8:39).  This is most fully developed in [[Pauline Christianity|Paul's theology]] where all who believe in God are spiritual descendants of Abraham.{{bibleref2c|Rom.|4:20}} {{bibleref2c|Gal.|4:9}}&lt;ref&gt;"So those who have faith are blessed along with Abraham, the man of faith."  "In other words, it is not the children by physical descent who are God's children, but it is the children of the promise who are regarded as Abraham's offspring." (Rom. 9:8)&lt;/ref&gt; However, with regards to {{Biblesource|Rom.|4:20}} and {{Biblesource|Gal.|4:9}}, in both cases he refers to these spiritual descendants as the "[[sons of God]]"{{bibleref2c|Gal.|4:26}} rather than "children of Abraham".&lt;ref&gt;Bickerman, p.&amp;nbsp;188cf.&lt;/ref&gt;

For Muslims, Abraham is a [[Prophet of Islam|prophet]], the "[[apostle (Islam)|messenger]] of God" who stands in the line from Adam to Muhammad, to whom God gave revelations,{{Cite quran|4|163}}, who "raised the foundations of the House" (i.e., the [[Kaaba]]){{Cite quran|2|127}} with his first son, [[Isma'il]], a symbol of which is every mosque.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| last = Leeming | first = David Adams | title = The Oxford companion to world mythology | publisher = Oxford University Press |year = 2005 | location = US | page = 209 | url = https://books.google.com/?id=kQFtlva3HaYC&amp;lpg=PA209&amp;pg=PA209#v=onepage&amp;q| isbn = 978-0-19-515669-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ibrahim ([[Abraham]]) is the first in a [[genealogy]] for Muhammad.

Also, the same as Judaism, Islam believes that Abraham rejected idolatry through logical reasoning. Abraham is also recalled in certain details of the annual [[Hajj]] pilgrimage.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| last = Hawting | first = Gerald R.  | title = The development of Islamic ritual; Volume 26 of The formation of the classical Islamic world | publisher = Ashgate Publishing, Ltd. | year = 2006 | pages = xviii, xix, xx, xxiii | url = https://books.google.com/?id=oCvf76uT3wMC&amp;lpg=PR18&amp;pg=PR18#v=onepage&amp;q | isbn = 978-0-86078-712-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== God ===
{{Main article|God in Abrahamic religions|God in Judaism|God in Christianity|God in Islam|Yahweh|Tetragrammaton|El (deity)}}
The Abrahamic God is conceived of as [[Eternity#God and eternity|eternal]], [[omnipotent]], [[omniscient]] and as the [[Creator deity|creator of the universe]]. God is further held to have the properties of holiness, justice, [[omnibenevolence]] and [[omnipresence]]. Proponents of Abrahamic faiths believe that God is also [[Transcendence (religion)|transcendent]], but at the same time [[personal God|personal]] and involved, listening to [[prayer]] and reacting to the actions of his creatures.

[[File:JudaismSymbol.PNG|thumb|right|The [[Star of David]] (or ''Magen David''), is a generally recognized symbol of modern Jewish identity and Judaism.]]
In [[Jewish theology]], God is strictly [[monotheistic]]. God is an absolute one, indivisible and incomparable [[being]] who is the ultimate cause of all existence. Jewish tradition teaches that the true aspect of God is incomprehensible and unknowable and that it is only God's revealed aspect that brought the universe into existence, and interacts with mankind and the world. In Judaism, the one God of Israel is the God of [[Abraham]], [[Isaac]], and [[Jacob]], who is the guide of the world, delivered [[Israelites|Israel]] from [[The Exodus|slavery in Egypt]], and gave them the [[613 Mitzvot]] at [[Mount Sinai]] as described in the [[Torah]].

The [[national god]] of the [[Israelite]]s has a [[Theonym|proper name]], written [[YHWH]] ({{Hebrew name|יְהֹוָה|Yehovah|Yəhōwāh}}) in the [[Tanakh|Hebrew Bible]]. The name YHWH is a combination of the future, present, and past tense of the verb "howa" ({{lang-he|הוה}}) meaning "to be" and translated literally means "The self-existent One". A further explanation of the name was given to Moses when YHWH stated ''Eheye Asher Eheye'' ({{lang-he|אהיה אשר אהיה}}) "I will be that I will be", the name relates to God as God truly is, God's revealed essence, which transcends the universe. It also represents God's compassion towards the world. In Jewish tradition another name of God is [[Elohim]], relating to the interaction between God and the universe, God as manifest in the physical world, it designates the justice of God, and means "the One who is the totality of powers, forces and causes in the universe".

[[File:Christianity Symbol.png|thumb|right|The [[Christian cross]] (or crux) is the best-known religious symbol of Christianity; this version is known as a Latin Cross.]]
In [[Christian theology]], God is the [[Eternity#God and eternity|eternal being]] who [[Genesis creation narrative|created]] and [[Divine providence|preserves]] the world. Christians believe God to be both transcendent and [[immanent]] (involved in the world).&lt;ref name=Leith55&gt;''Basic Christian Doctrine'' by John H.

Around the year 200, [[Tertullian]] formulated a version of the doctrine of the [[Trinity]] which clearly affirmed the divinity of Jesus and came close to the later definitive form produced by the [[First Council of Constantinople|Ecumenical Council of 381]].&lt;ref name=Prestige29&gt;Prestige G.L.

[[File:IslamSymbolAllahComp.PNG|thumb|right|The word [[God]] written in [[Arabic]].]]
In [[Islamic theology]], God ({{lang-ar|{{large|الله}}}} ''[[Allāh|{{transl|ar|ALA|Allāh}}]]'') is the [[Omnipotence|all-powerful]] and [[Omniscience|all-knowing]] creator, sustainer, ordainer and judge of everything in existence.&lt;ref name="EoQ-Quran"&gt;Gerhard Böwering ''God and his Attributes'', [[Encyclopaedia of the Qurʾān]] Quran.com, ''Islam: The Straight Path'', Oxford University Press, 1998, p.&amp;nbsp;22&lt;/ref&gt; Islam emphasizes that God is strictly singular (''[[tawhid|{{transl|ar|ALA|tawḥīd}}]]'')&lt;ref&gt;John L. Esposito, ''Islam: The Straight Path'', Oxford University Press, 1998, p.&amp;nbsp;88&lt;/ref&gt; unique (''{{transl|ar|ALA|wāḥid}}'') and inherently One (''{{transl|ar|ALA|aḥad}}''), all-merciful and omnipotent.&lt;ref name="Britannica_A"&gt;"Allah". [[Encyclopædia Britannica]]. 2007. Encyclopædia Britannica&lt;/ref&gt; According to Islamic teachings, God exists without place&lt;ref name="Britannica p3"&gt;Britannica Encyclopedia, "Islam", p.&amp;nbsp;3&lt;/ref&gt; and according to the Quran, "No vision can grasp him, but His grasp is over all vision: He is above all comprehension, yet is acquainted with all things."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite quran|6|103|style=ns}}&lt;/ref&gt; God, as referenced in the Quran, is the only God.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite quran|29|46|style=ns}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Peters1"&gt;F. E. Peters, ''Islam'', p.&amp;nbsp;4, Princeton University Press, 2003&lt;/ref&gt; Islamic tradition also describes the [[Names of God in the Qur'an|99 names of God]]. These 99 names describe attributes of God, including Most Merciful, The Just, The Peace and Blessing, and the Guardian.

Islamic belief in God is distinct from Christianity in that God has no progeny. This belief is summed up in [[Sura|chapter]] 112 of the Quran titled [[Al-Ikhlas]], which states "Say, he is Allah (who is) one, Allah is the Eternal, the Absolute. He does not beget nor was he begotten. Nor is there to Him any equivalent".{{cite quran|112|1|4}}

=== Scriptures ===
{{Main article|Tanakh|Bible|Old Testament|New Testament|Quran|Hadith}}
All these religions rely on a body of scriptures, some of which are considered to be the word of God—hence sacred and unquestionable—and some the work of religious men, revered mainly by tradition and to the extent that they are considered to have been divinely inspired, if not dictated, by the divine being.

The sacred scriptures of Judaism are the [[Hebrew Bible|Tanakh]], a Hebrew acronym standing for ''[[Torah]]'' (Law or Teachings), ''[[Nevi'im]]'' (Prophets) and ''[[Ketuvim]]'' (Writings). These are complemented by and supplemented with various (originally oral) traditions: ''[[Midrash]]'', the ''[[Mishnah]]'', the ''[[Talmud]]'' and collected rabbinical writings. The Tanakh (or [[Hebrew Bible]]) was composed between 1,400 BCE, and 400 BCE by Jewish [[:Category:Jewish prophets|prophets]], kings, and [[Kohen|priests]].

The Hebrew text of the Tanakh, and the Torah in particular is considered holy, down to the last letter: transcribing is done with painstaking care. An error in a single letter, ornamentation or symbol of the 300,000+ stylized letters that make up the Hebrew Torah text renders a Torah scroll unfit for use; hence the skills of a Torah scribe are specialist skills, and a scroll takes considerable time to write and check.

[[File:Bible.malmesbury.arp.jpg|thumb|250px|A Bible handwritten in [[Latin]], on display in [[Malmesbury Abbey]], Wiltshire, England. This Bible was transcribed in Belgium in 1407 for reading aloud in a monastery.]]
The sacred scriptures of most Christian groups are the [[Old Testament]] and the [[New Testament]]. Latin Bibles originally contained 73 books; however, 7 books, collectively called the [[Apocrypha]] or [[Deuterocanon]] depending on one's opinion of them, were removed by [[Martin Luther]] due to a lack of original Hebrew sources, and now vary on their inclusion between denominations. Greek Bibles contain additional materials.

The New Testament comprises four accounts of the life and teachings of Jesus (the [[Four Gospels]]), as well as several other writings (the [[Epistle#New Testament epistles|epistles]]) and the [[Book of Revelation]]. They are usually considered to be [[Biblical inspiration|divinely inspired]], and together comprise the [[Bible|Christian Bible]].

The vast majority of Christian faiths (including Catholicism, Orthodox Christianity, and most forms of Protestantism) recognize that the Gospels were passed on by oral tradition, and were not set to paper until decades after the resurrection of Jesus and that the extant versions are copies of those originals. The version of the Bible considered to be most valid (in the sense of best conveying the true meaning of the word of God) has varied considerably: the Greek [[Septuagint]], the [[Syriac language|Syriac]] [[Peshitta]], the [[Latin]] [[Vulgate]], the English [[King James Version of the Bible|King James Version]] and the Russian Synodal Bible have been authoritative to different communities at different times.

The sacred scriptures of the Christian Bible are complemented by a large body of writings by individual Christians and councils of Christian leaders (see [[canon law]]). Some Christian churches and denominations consider certain additional writings to be binding; other Christian groups consider only the Bible to be binding ([[sola scriptura]]).

[[File:Quran rzabasi1.JPG|thumb|9th-century Quran in [[Reza Abbasi Museum]]]]
Islam's holiest book is the Quran, comprising 114 [[Sura]]s ("chapters of the Qur'an"). However, Muslims also believe in the religious texts of Judaism and Christianity in their original forms, albeit not the current versions. According to the Quran (and mainstream Muslim belief), the verses of the Quran were revealed by God through the Archangel [[Jibrail]] to Muhammad on separate occasions. These revelations were written down and also memorized by hundreds of companions of Muhammad. These multiple sources were collected into one official copy. After the death of Mohammed, Quran was copied on several copies and Caliph [[Uthman]] provided these copies to different cities of Islamic Empire.

The Quran mentions and reveres several of the Israelite prophets, including Moses and [[Jesus#Islamic views|Jesus]], among others (see also: [[Prophets of Islam]]). The stories of these prophets are very similar to those in the Bible. However, the detailed precepts of the Tanakh and the [[New Testament]] are not adopted outright; they are replaced by the new commandments accepted as revealed directly by God (through Gabriel) to Muhammad and codified in the Quran.

Like the Jews with the Torah, Muslims consider the original [[Arabic language|Arabic]] text of the Quran as uncorrupted and holy to the last letter, and any translations are considered to be interpretations of the meaning of the Quran, as only the original Arabic text is considered to be the divine scripture.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| author = [[Mona Baker|Baker, Mona]] |author2= Saldanha, Gabriela | title = Routledge encyclopedia of translation studies | publisher = Routledge | year = 2008 | page = 227 | url = https://books.google.com/?id=eXsDckV5GuMC&amp;lpg=PA227&amp;pg=PA227#v=onepage&amp;q | isbn = 978-0-415-36930-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Like the Rabbinic [[Oral Law]] to the Hebrew Bible, the Quran is complemented by the ''[[Hadith]]'', a set of books by later authors recording the sayings of the prophet Muhammad. The Hadith interpret and elaborate Qur'anic precepts. Islamic scholars have categorized each Hadith at one of the following levels of authenticity or [[isnad]]: genuine (''sahih''), fair (''hasan'') or weak (''da'if'').&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| last = ʻUthmān ibn ʻAbd al-Raḥmān Ibn al-Ṣalāḥ al-Shahrazūrī |author2= Eerik Dickinson | title = An Introduction to the Science of Hadith: Kitab Ma'rifat Anwa' 'ilm Al-hadith | publisher = Garnet &amp; Ithaca Press | year = 2006 | page = 5 | url = https://books.google.com/?id=Yq-aprUAyuUC&amp;lpg=PA15&amp;pg=PA5#v=onepage&amp;q | isbn = 978-1-85964-158-3 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

By the 9th century, [[six major Hadith collections]] were accepted as reliable to Sunni Muslims.
* [[Sahih al-Bukhari]]
* [[Sahih Muslim]]
* [[Sunan ibn Majah]]
* [[Sunan Abu Dawud]]
* [[Jami al-Tirmidhi]]
* [[Sunan an-Nasa'ii]]

Shia Muslims, however, refer to other authenticated hadiths instead.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| last = Momen | first = Moojan | title = An introduction to Shiʻi Islam: the history and doctrines of Twelver Shiʻism| publisher = Yale University Press | year = 1985 | pages = 173–4 | url =https://books.google.com/books?id=zot5IK1csp0C&amp;dq| isbn = 978-0-300-03531-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; They are known collectively as [[The Four Books]].

The Hadith and the life story of Muhammad ([[Sirah Rasul Allah|sira]]) form the [[Sunnah]], an authoritative supplement to the Quran. The legal opinions of Islamic jurists ([[Faqīh]]) provide another source for the daily practice and interpretation of Islamic tradition (see [[Fiqh]].)

The Quran contains repeated references to the "religion of Abraham" (see Suras 2:130,135; 3:95; 6:123,161; 12:38; 16:123; 22:78). In the Quran, this expression refers specifically to Islam; sometimes in contrast to Christianity and Judaism, as in Sura 2:135, for example: 'They say: "Become Jews or Christians if ye would be guided (to salvation)." Say thou (O Muslims): "Nay! (I would rather) the Religion of Abraham the True, and he joined not gods with God." ' In the Quran, Abraham is declared to have been a Muslim (a ''[[hanif]]'', more accurately a "[[fitra|primordial monotheist]]"), not a Jew nor a Christian (Sura 3:67).

=== Eschatology ===
{{Main article|Eschatology|Jewish eschatology|Christian eschatology|Islamic eschatology}}
In the major Abrahamic religions, there exists the expectation of an individual who will herald the [[Eschatology|time of the end]] or bring about the [[Kingdom of God]] on Earth; in other words, the [[Messianic prophecy]]. Judaism awaits the coming of the [[Jewish Messiah]]; the Jewish concept of Messiah differs from the Christian concept in several significant ways, despite the same term being applied to both. The Jewish Messiah is not seen as a "god", but as a mortal man who by his holiness is worthy of that description. His appearance is not the end of history, rather it signals the coming of the [[Jewish eschatology#Olam Haba|world to come]].

Christianity awaits the [[Second Coming]] of Christ, though [[Full Preterism|Full Preterists]] believe this has already happened. Islam awaits both the second coming of Jesus (to complete his life and die) and the coming of [[Mahdi]] (Sunnis in his first incarnation, Shia as the return of [[Muhammad al-Mahdi]]).

Most Abrahamic religions agree that a human being comprises the body, which dies, and the [[soul]], which is [[Immortality of the Soul|capable of remaining alive beyond human death]] and carries the person's essence, and that God will judge each person's life accordingly after death. The importance of this and the focus on it, as well as the precise criteria and end result, differ between religions.{{Citation needed|date=August 2009}}

Judaism's views on the afterlife ("the Next World") are quite diverse. This can be attributed to the fact that although there clearly are traditions in the [[Hebrew Bible]] of an afterlife (see [[Naboth]] and the [[Witch of Endor]]), Judaism focuses on this life and how to lead a holy life to please God, rather than future reward.

Christians have more diverse and definite teachings on the [[end times]] and what constitutes [[afterlife]]. Most Christian approaches either include different abodes for the dead ([[Heaven (Christianity)|Heaven]], [[Hell]], [[Limbo]], [[Purgatory]]) or [[universal reconciliation]] because all souls are made in the [[image of God]]. A small minority teach [[annihilationism]], the doctrine that those persons who are not reconciled to God simply cease to exist.

In Islam, God is said to be "Most Compassionate and Most Merciful" (Quran 1:2, as well as the start of all suras but one). However, God is also "Most Just"; Islam prescribes a literal [[Hell#Islam|Hell]] for those who disobey God and commit gross sin. Those who obey God and submit to God will be rewarded with their own place in Paradise. While sinners are punished with fire, there are also many other forms of punishment described, depending on the sin committed; Hell is divided into numerous levels.

Those who worship and remember God are promised eternal abode in a physical and spiritual Paradise. Heaven is divided into eight [[Jannah|levels]], with the highest level of Paradise being the reward of those who have been most virtuous, the prophets, and those killed while fighting for Allah (martyrs).

Upon repentance to God, many sins can be forgiven, on the condition they are not repeated, as God is supremely merciful. Additionally, those who believe in God, but have led sinful lives, may be punished for a time, and then eventually released into Paradise. If anyone dies in a state of [[Shirk (polytheism)|Shirk]] (i.e. associating God in any way, such as claiming that He is equal with anything or denying Him), this is not pardonable—he or she will stay forever in Hell.

Once a person is admitted to Paradise, this person will abide there for eternity.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=al-Misri|first=Ahmad ibn Naqib|title=Reliance of the Traveler (edited and translated by Nuh Ha Mim Keller)|publisher=Amana Publications|year=1994|pages=995–1002|isbn=978-0-915957-72-9|title-link=Nuh Ha Mim Keller}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Worship and religious rites ===
{{Main article|Christian worship}}
Worship, ceremonies and religion-related customs differ substantially among the Abrahamic religions. Among the few similarities are a seven-day cycle in which one day is nominally reserved for worship, prayer or other religious activities—''[[Shabbat]]'', [[Christian Sabbath|Sabbath]], or ''[[jumu'ah]]''; this custom is related to the biblical story of Genesis, where God created the universe in six days and rested in the seventh.

[[Orthodox Judaism]] practice is guided by the interpretation of the [[Torah]] and the [[Talmud]]. Before the destruction of the [[Temple in Jerusalem]], Jewish priests offered [[korban|sacrifices]] there two times daily; since then, the practice has been replaced, until the Temple is rebuilt, by Jewish men being required to pray three times daily, including the [[Cantillation|chanting]] of the [[Torah]], and facing in the direction of [[Jerusalem]]'s [[Temple Mount]]. Other practices include [[Brit milah|circumcision]], [[Kashrut|dietary laws]], [[Shabbat]], [[Passover Seder|Passover]], [[Torah study]], [[Tefillin]], [[Niddah|purity]] and [[613 Mitzvot|others]]. [[Conservative Judaism]], [[Reform Judaism]] and the [[Reconstructionist Judaism|Reconstructionist]] movement all move away, in different degrees, from the strict tradition of the law.

Jewish women's prayer obligations vary by [[Jewish religious movements|denomination]]; in contemporary Orthodox practice, women do not read from the [[Torah]] and are only required to say certain parts of these daily services.

All versions of Judaism share a common, specialized calendar, containing many festivals. The calendar is lunisolar, with lunar months and a solar year (an extra month is added every second or third year to allow the shorter lunar year to "catch up" to the solar year). All streams observe the same festivals, but some emphasize them differently. As is usual with its extensive law system, the Orthodox have the most complex manner of observing the festivals, while the Reform pay more attention to the simple symbolism of each one.

Christian worship varies from [[Christian denominations|denomination to denomination]]. Individual [[Prayer in Christianity|prayer]] is usually not ritualised, while group prayer may be ritual or non-ritual according to the occasion. During church services, some form of [[liturgy]] is frequently followed. Rituals are performed during [[sacraments]], which also vary from denomination to denomination and usually include [[Baptism]] and [[Eucharist|Communion]], and may also include [[Confirmation]], [[Confession (religion)|Confession]], [[Last Rites]] and [[Holy Orders]].

Catholic worship practice is governed by the [[Roman Missal]] and other documents. Individuals, churches and denominations place different emphasis on ritual—some denominations consider most ritual activity optional, see [[Adiaphora]], particularly since the [[Protestant Reformation]].

The followers of Islam (Muslims) are to observe the [[Five Pillars of Islam]]. The first pillar is the belief in the oneness of Allah, and in Muhammad as his final and most perfect prophet. The second is to pray five times daily ([[salat]]) towards the direction ([[qibla]]) of the [[Kaaba]] in [[Mecca]]. The third pillar is almsgiving ([[Zakah]]), a portion of one's wealth given to the poor or to other specified causes, which means the giving of a specific share of one's wealth and savings to persons or causes, as is commanded in the Quran and elucidated as to specific percentages for different kinds of income and wealth in the [[hadith]]. The normal share to be paid is two and a half percent of one's earnings: this increases if labour was not required, and increases further if only capital or possessions alone were required (i.e. proceeds from renting space), and increases to 50% on "unearned wealth" such as treasure-finding, and to 100% on wealth that is considered [[haram]], as part of attempting to make atonement for the sin, such as that gained through financial interest ([[riba]]).

[[Fasting]] ([[sawm]]) during the ninth month of the Muslim lunar calendar, [[Ramadan]], is the fourth pillar of Islam, to which all Muslims after the age of puberty in good health (as judged by a Muslim doctor to be able fast without incurring grave danger to health: even in seemingly obvious situations, a "competent and upright Muslim physician" is required to agree), that are not menstruating are bound to observe—missed days of the fast for any reason must be made up, unless there be a permanent illness, such as diabetes, that prevents a person from ever fasting. In such a case, restitution must be made by feeding one poor person for each day missed.

Finally, Muslims are also required, if physically able, to undertake a [[Hajj|pilgrimage]] to [[Mecca]] at least once in one's life: it is strongly recommended to do it as often as possible, preferably once a year. Only individuals whose financial position and health are severely insufficient are exempt from making Hajj (e.g. if making Hajj would put stress on one's financial situation, but would not end up in homelessness or starvation, it is still required). During this pilgrimage, the Muslims spend three to seven days in worship, performing several strictly defined rituals, most notably circumambulating the [[Kaaba]] among millions of other Muslims and the "[[stoning of the devil]]" at [[Mina, Saudi Arabia|Mina]].

At the end of the [[Hajj]], the heads of men are shaved, sheep and other [[halal]] animals, notably [[camel]]s, are slaughtered as a ritual sacrifice by bleeding out at the neck according to a strictly prescribed ritual slaughter method similar to the Jewish [[kashrut]], to commemorate the moment when, according to Islamic tradition, Allah replaced Abraham's son [[Ishmael]] (contrasted with the [[Judaeo-Christian]] tradition that [[Isaac]] was the intended sacrifice) with a sheep, thereby preventing human sacrifice. The meat from these animals is then distributed locally to needy Muslims, neighbours and relatives. Finally, the hajji puts off ''[[ihram]]'' and the hajj is complete.{{Citation needed|date=August 2009}}

=== Circumcision ===
{{See also|Circumcision in the Bible|Brit Milah|Khatna|Circumcision controversy in early Christianity|History of male circumcision}}
Judaism practices [[brit milah|circumcision]] for males as a matter of religious obligation at the age of 8 days old, as does [[Khitan (Circumcision)|Islam]] as part of Sunnah.

[[Western Christianity]] replaced that custom with a [[baptism]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://jewishencyclopedia.com/view.jsp?artid=222&amp;letter=B&amp;search=Baptism Jewish Encyclopedia: Baptism]: "According to rabbinical teachings, which dominated even during the existence of the Temple (Pes. viii. 8), Baptism, next to circumcision and sacrifice, was an absolutely necessary condition to be fulfilled by a [[proselyte]] to Judaism (Yeb. 46b, 47b; Ker. 9a; 'Ab. Zarah 57a; Shab. 135a; Yer. Kid. iii. 14, 64d). Circumcision, however, was much more important, and, like baptism, was called a "seal" (Schlatter, "Die Kirche Jerusalems", 1898, p.&amp;nbsp;70). But as circumcision was discarded by Christianity, and the sacrifices had ceased, Baptism remained the sole condition for initiation into religious life. The next ceremony, adopted shortly after the others, was the [[Laying on of hands|imposition of hands]], which, it is known, was the usage of the Jews at the ordination of a rabbi. [[Anointing]] with oil, which at first also accompanied the act of Baptism, and was analogous to the anointment of priests among the Jews, was not a necessary condition".&lt;/ref&gt; ceremony varying according to the denomination, but generally including [[Baptism by immersion|immersion]], [[aspersion]], or [[anointment]] with water. The [[Early Church]] (Acts 15, the [[Council of Jerusalem]]) decided that circumcision is not required for [[Gentile Christians]]. The [[Council of Florence]] in the 15th century&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cirp.org/library/cultural/councilflorence/ "Ecumenical Council of Florence (1438–1445)"]. The Circumcision Reference Library.

=== Food restrictions ===
{{Main article|kashrut|halal|ital}}
{{See also|Apostolic Decree}}
Judaism and Islam have strict [[dietary laws]], with permitted food known as [[kosher]] in Judaism, and [[halal]] in Islam. These two religions prohibit the consumption of pork; Islam prohibits the consumption of alcoholic beverages of any kind. Halal restrictions can be seen as a modification of the [[kashrut]] dietary laws, so many kosher foods are considered halal; especially in the case of meat, which Islam prescribes must be slaughtered in the name of God.  Hence, in many places, Muslims used to consume kosher food.  However, some foods not considered kosher are considered halal in Islam.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.soundvision.com/info/halalhealthy/halal.kosher.asp "Halal &amp; Healthy: Is Kosher Halal"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090823055532/http://www.soundvision.com/info/halalhealthy/halal.kosher.asp |date=23 August 2009 }}, SoundVision.com—Islamic information &amp; products. 5 August 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

With rare exceptions, Christians do not consider the Old Testament's strict food laws as relevant for today's church; see also [[Biblical law in Christianity]]. Most Protestants have no set food laws, but there are minority exceptions.&lt;ref&gt;Schuchmann, Jennifer. [http://www.christianitytoday.com/tc/todaysculture/healthhealing/3.40.html?start=1 "Does God Care What We Eat?"], ''Today's Christian'', January/February 2006. Retrieved 6 August 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Roman Catholic Church believes in observing abstinence and penance. For example, all Fridays through the year and the time of Lent are penitential days.&lt;ref&gt;Canon 1250, 1983. The 1983 Code of Canon Law specifies the obligations of Latin Rite Catholic.&lt;/ref&gt; The law of abstinence requires a Catholic from 14 years of age until death to abstain from eating meat on Fridays in honor of the Passion of Jesus on Good Friday. The [[United States Conference of Catholic Bishops]] obtained the permission of the Holy See for Catholics in the U.S. to substitute a penitential, or even a charitable, practice of their own choosing.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.catholic.org/clife/lent/abfast.php "Fasting and Abstinence"], Catholic Online. 6 August 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Eastern Rite Catholics]] have their own penitential practices as specified by the Code of Canons for the Eastern Churches.

The [[Seventh-day Adventist Church]] (SDA) embraces numerous Old Testament rules and regulations such as tithing, Sabbath observance, and Jewish food laws. Therefore, they do not eat pork, shellfish, or other foods considered unclean under the [[Old Covenant]]. The "Fundamental Beliefs" of the SDA state that their members "are to adopt the most healthful diet possible and abstain from the unclean foods identified in the Scriptures".{{Bibleref2c|Leviticus|11:1–47}} &lt;sup&gt;among others&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.adventist.org/beliefs/fundamental/index.html "Fundamental Beliefs"], No. 22. Christian Behavior. Seventh-Day Adventist Church website. 6 August 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[Christian Bible]], the consumption of strangled animals and of [[Taboo food and drink#Blood|blood]] was forbidden by [[Apostolic Decree]]{{Bibleref2c|Acts|15:19–21}} and are still forbidden in the [[Greek Orthodox]] Church, according to German theologian [[Karl Josef von Hefele]], who, in his Commentary on Canon II of the Second Ecumenical Council held in the 4th century at Gangra, notes: "We further see that, at the time of the Synod of [[Gangra]], the rule of the Apostolic Synod [the [[Council of Jerusalem]] of Acts 15] with regard to blood and things strangled was still in force. With the [[Greek Orthodox|Greeks]], indeed, it continued always in force as their Euchologies still show." He also writes that "as late as the eighth century, [[Pope Gregory III|Pope Gregory the Third]], in 731, forbade the eating of blood or things strangled under threat of a penance of forty days."&lt;ref&gt;Schaff, Philip. "Canon II of The Council of Gangra". ''The Seven Ecumenical Councils.'' 6 August 2009. [http://www.ccel.org/ccel/schaff/npnf214.viii.v.iv.ii.html Commentary on Canon II of Gangra].&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Jehovah's Witnesses]] abstain from eating blood and from [[blood transfusions]] based on {{bibleref2|Acts|15:19–21}}.

[[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]] prohibits the consumption of alcohol, coffee, and non-herbal tea. While there is not a set of prohibited food, the church encourages members to refrain from eating excessive amounts of red meat.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.lds.org/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/89|title=Doctrine and Covenants 89|website=Lds.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Sabbath observance ===
{{See also|Biblical Sabbath|Shabbat|Christian Sabbath|Jumu'ah}}
Sabbath in the Bible is a weekly day of [[leisure|rest]] and time of [[worship]]. It is observed differently in Judaism, Christianity, and Islam and informs a similar occasion in several other Abrahamic faiths. Though many viewpoints and definitions have arisen over the millennia, most originate in the same textual tradition.

=== Proselytism ===
Judaism accepts converts, but has had no explicit [[missionary|missionaries]] since the end of the [[Second Temple Judaism|Second Temple era]]. Judaism states that non-Jews can achieve righteousness by following [[Noahide Laws]], a set of moral imperatives that, according to the [[Talmud]], were given by God&lt;ref&gt;According to Encyclopedia Talmudit (Hebrew edition, Israel, 5741/1981, Entry ''Ben Noah'', page 349), most [[Rishonim|medieval authorities]] consider that all seven commandments were given to [[Adam]], although [[Maimonides]] ([[Mishneh Torah]], Hilkhot M'lakhim 9:1) considers the dietary law to have been given to Noah.&lt;/ref&gt; as a binding set of laws for the "children of [[Noah]]"—that is, all of humanity.&lt;ref&gt;Encyclopedia Talmudit (Hebrew edition, Israel, 5741/1981, entry ''Ben Noah'', introduction) states that after the giving of the [[Torah]], the Jewish people were no longer in the category of the sons of Noah; however, Maimonides (Mishneh Torah, Hilkhot M'lakhim 9:1) indicates that the seven laws are also part of the Torah, and the Talmud (Bavli, [[Sanhedrin]] 59a, see also Tosafot ad. loc.) states that Jews are obligated in all things that Gentiles are obligated in, albeit with some differences in the details.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Compare {{bibleverse||Genesis|9:4–6|HE}}.&lt;/ref&gt; It is believed that as much as ten percent of the Roman Empire followed the Judaism either as fully ritually obligated Jews or the simpler rituals required of non-Jewish members of that faith.&lt;ref name="times"&gt;{{cite book |trans-title=[[The Times Atlas of World History]] |title=Spectrum–Times Atlas van de Wereldgeschiedenis |editor-first=Geoffrey |editor-last=Barraclough |editor-link=Geoffrey Barraclough |year=1981 |orig-year=1978 |publisher=Het Spectrum |pages=102–103}} {{nl icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Moses Maimonides]], one of the major Jewish teachers, commented: "Quoting from our sages, the righteous people from other nations have a place in the world to come if they have acquired what they should learn about the Creator". Because the commandments applicable to the Jews are much more detailed and onerous than [[Noahide]] laws, Jewish scholars have traditionally maintained that it is better to be a good non-Jew than a bad Jew, thus discouraging conversion. In the U.S., as of 2003 28% of married Jews were married to non-Jews.&lt;ref&gt;Kornbluth, Doron. ''Why marry Jewish?''.

Christianity encourages [[evangelism]]. Many Christian organizations, especially Protestant churches, send [[missionary|missionaries]] to non-Christian communities throughout the world. ''See also [[Great Commission]]''. [[Forced conversion]]s to Catholicism have been alleged at various points throughout history. The most prominently cited allegations are the [[Constantine I turn against Paganism|conversions of the pagans after Constantine]]; of Muslims, Jews and Eastern Orthodox during the [[Crusades]]; of Jews and Muslims during the time of the [[Spanish Inquisition]], where they were offered the choice of exile, conversion or death; and of the Aztecs by [[Hernán Cortés]]. Forced conversions to Protestantism may have occurred as well, notably during the [[Reformation]], especially in England and Ireland (see [[recusancy]] and [[Popish plot]]).

Forced conversions are condemned as sinful by major denominations such as the Roman Catholic Church, which officially states that forced conversions pollute the Christian religion and offend human dignity, so that past or present offences are regarded as a scandal (a cause of unbelief). According to [[Pope Paul VI]], "It is one of the major tenets of Catholic doctrine that man's response to God in faith must be free: no one, therefore, is to be forced to embrace the Christian faith against his own will."&lt;ref&gt;Pope Paul VI.

[[Dawah]] is an important Islamic concept which denotes the preaching of Islam. Da‘wah literally means "issuing a summons" or "making an invitation". A Muslim who practices da‘wah, either as a religious worker or in a volunteer community effort, is called a dā‘ī, plural du‘āt. A dā‘ī is thus a person who invites people to understand Islam through a dialogical process and may be categorized in some cases as the Islamic equivalent of a missionary, as one who invites people to the faith, to the prayer, or to Islamic life.

Da'wah activities can take many forms. Some pursue Islamic studies specifically to perform Da'wah. [[Mosques]] and other Islamic centers sometimes spread Da'wah actively, similar to evangelical churches. Others consider being open to the public and answering questions to be Da'wah. Recalling Muslims to the faith and expanding their knowledge can also be considered Da'wah.

In [[Islamic theology]], the purpose of Da‘wah is to invite people, both Muslims and non-Muslims, to understand the commandments of God as expressed in the Quran and the Sunnah of the Prophet, as well as to inform them about Muhammad. Da‘wah produces converts to Islam, which in turn grows the size of the Muslim [[Ummah]], or community of Muslims.

And a Christian says, 'I am greater than both the Muslim and the Jew, and the rest of the religions, because I am the nation of God's Son.'" However, Gohar Shahi himself "declares that superior and best of all is the one who possesses God's love in his heart, in spite of his indifference to any religion".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.goharshahi.us/about/|title=Imam Mehdi Gohar Shahi – About Imam Mehdi|first=His Holiness Ra Riaz Gohar|last=Shahi|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Amir Hussain'''&lt;br /&gt;
In 2003, a book called ''Progressive Muslims: On Justice, Gender, and Pluralism'' contains a chapter by [[Amir Hussain]] on "Muslims, Pluralism, and Interfaith Dialogue" which he shows how interfaith dialogue has been an integral part of Islam from its beginning. From his "first revelation" for the rest of his life, Muhammad was "engaged in interfaith dialogue." Islam would not have spread without "interfaith dialogue."&lt;ref&gt;Amir Hussain, "Muslims, Pluralism, and Interfaith Dialogue," in ''Progressive Muslims: On Justice, Gender, and Pluralism'', ed. Omid Safi, 252–253 (Oneworld Publications, 2003).&lt;/ref&gt;

Hussain gives an early example of "the importance of pluralism and interfaith dialogue" to Islam. When some of Muhammad’s followers suffered "physical persecution" in [[Mecca]], he sent them to [[Ethiopian Empire|Abyssinia]], a Christian nation, where they were "welcomed and accepted" by the Christian king. Another example is [[Córdoba, Andalusia]] in Muslim Spain, in the ninth and tenth centuries. Córdoba was "one of the most important cities in the history of the world". In "Christians and Jews were involved in the Royal Court and the intellectual life of the city." Thus, there is "a history of Muslims, Jews, Christians, and other religious traditions living together in a pluralistic society."&lt;ref&gt;Amir Hussain, "Muslims, Pluralism, and Interfaith Dialogue," in ''Progressive Muslims: On Justice, Gender, and Pluralism'', ed. Omid Safi, 253–254 (Oneworld Publications, 2003).&lt;/ref&gt;

Turning to the present, Hussain says that one of the challenges faced by Muslims now is the conflicting passages in the Qur̀an some of which support interfaith "bridge-building," but others can be used "justify mutual exclusion." 
&lt;ref&gt;Amir Hussain, "Muslims, Pluralism, and Interfaith Dialogue," in ''Progressive Muslims: On Justice, Gender, and Pluralism'', ed. Omid Safi, 254 (Oneworld Publications, 2003).&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Trialogue'''&lt;br /&gt;
The 2007 book ''Trialogue: Jews, Christians, and Muslims in Dialogue'' puts the importance of interfaith dialogue starkly: "We human beings today face a stark choice: dialogue or death!"&lt;ref&gt;Leonard Swidler, Khalid Duran, Reuven Firestone, ''Trialogue: Jews, Christians, and Muslims in Dialogue'' (Twenty-Third Publications, 2007), 1, 7.&lt;/ref&gt;
The ''Trialogue'' book gives four reasons why the three Abrahamic religions should engage in dialogue:&lt;ref&gt;Leonard Swidler, Khalid Duran, Reuven Firestone, ''Trialogue: Jews, Christians, and Muslims in Dialogue'' (Twenty-Third Publications, 2007), 38.&lt;/ref&gt;
:1. They "come from the same Hebraic roots and claim Abraham as their originating ancester."
:2. "All three traditions are religions of ethical monotheism."
:3. They "are all historical religions."
:4. All three are "religions of revelation."

'''Pope Benedict XVI'''&lt;br /&gt;
In 2010, [[Pope Benedict XVI]] spoke about "Interreligious dialogue."  He said that "the Church's universal nature and vocation require that she engage in dialogue with the members of other religions." For the Abrahamic religions, this "dialogue is based on the spiritual and historical bonds uniting Christians to Jews and Muslims." It is dialogue "grounded in the sacred Scriptures" and "defined in the Dogmatic Constitution on the Church ''Lumen Gentium'' and in the Declaration on the Church's Relation to Non-Christian Religions ''Nostra Aetate''. The Pope concluded with a prayer: "May Jews, Christians and Muslims . . .  give the beautiful witness of serenity and concord between the children of Abraham."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://w2.vatican.va/content/benedict-xvi/en/apost_exhortations/documents/hf_ben-xvi_exh_20120914_ecclesia-in-medio-oriente.html|title=Ecclesia in Medio Oriente: Post-Synodal Apostolic Exhortation on the Church in the Middle East: Communion and Witness (14 September 2012) – BENEDICT XVI|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Learned Ignorance'''&lt;br /&gt;
In the 2011 book ''Learned Ignorance: Intellectual Humility Among Jews, Christians and Muslims'', the three editors address the question of "why engage in interreligious dialogue; its purpose?":
*[https://dornsife.usc.edu/tools/mytools/PersonnelInfoSystem/DOC/Faculty/REL/vita_1012733.pdf James L. Heft], a Roman Catholic priest, suggests "that the purpose of interreligious dialogue is, not only better mutual understanding . . . but also trying . . . to embody the truths that we affirm."&lt;ref&gt;James L. Heft, Reuven Firestone, and Omid Safi, ''Learned Ignorance: Intellectual Humility Among Jews, Christians and Muslims'' (Oxford University Press, USA, 2011), 301–302.&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Omid Safi]], a Muslim, answers the question of "why engage in interreligious dialogue?" He writes, "because for me, as a Muslim, God is greater than any one path leading to God." Therefore, "neither I nor my traditions has a monopoly on truth, because in reality, we belong to the Truth (God), Truth to us."&lt;ref&gt;James L. Heft, Reuven Firestone, and Omid Safi, editors, ''Learned Ignorance: Intellectual Humility Among Jews, Christians and Muslims'' (Oxford University Press, USA, 2011), 305.&lt;/ref&gt;
*[http://huc.edu/directory/reuven-firestone# Reuven Firestone], a Jewish Rabbi writes about the "tension" between the "particularity" of one's "own religious experience" and the "universality of the divine reality" that as expressed in history has led to verbal and violent conflict. So, although this tension may never be "fully resolved," Firestone says that "it is of utmost consequence for leaders in religion to engage in the process of dialogue."&lt;ref&gt;James L. Heft, Reuven Firestone, and Omid Safi, editors, ''Learned Ignorance: Intellectual Humility Among Jews, Christians and Muslims'' (Oxford University Press, USA, 2011), 308.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''The Interfaith Amigos'''&lt;br /&gt;
In 2011, [[TED (conference)|TED]] broadcast a 10-minute program about "Breaking the Taboos of Interfaith Dialogue" with Rabbi Ted Falcon (Jewish), Pastor Don Mackenzie (Christian), and Imam Jamal Rahman (Muslim) collectively known as [http://interfaithamigos.com/Home.html The Interfaith Amigos] See their TED program [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tPnZArtsG_c by '''clicking here'''.]

'''Divisive matters should be addressed'''&lt;br /&gt;
In 2012, a [[PhD]] thesis ''Dialogue Between Christians, Jews and Muslims'' argues that "the paramount need is for barriers against non-defensive dialogue conversations between Christians, Jews, and Muslims to be dismantled to facilitate the development of common understandings on matters that are deeply divisive." As of 2012, the thesis says that this has not been done.&lt;ref&gt;[http://traubman.igc.org/frythesis.pdf Ian Rex Fry, ''Dialogue Between Christians, Jews and Muslims'' (PhD Thesis, 2012), 37, 333. Retrieved July 3, 2016.]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Cardinal Koch'''&lt;br /&gt;
In 2015, Cardinal [[Kurt Koch]], the President of the [[Pontifical Council for Promoting Christian Unity]] and who is "responsible for the Church's dialogue with the Jewish people," was interviewed in 2015. He noted that the Church is already engaged in "bilateral talks with Jewish and Muslim religious leaders." However, he said that it is too early for "trialogue" talks among the three Abrahamic religions. Yet, Koch added, "we hope that we can go in this [direction] in future."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://en.radiovaticana.va/news/2015/05/22/cardinal_koch_trialogue_among_catholics,_jews,_muslims/1145856|title=Cardinal Koch: Trialogue among Catholics, Jews, Muslims?|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Omid Safi'''&lt;br /&gt;
In 2016, a 26-minute interview with Professor [[Omid Safi]], a Muslim and Director of the [http://islamicstudies.duke.edu/ Duke Islamic Studies Center], was posted on YouTube.com. In it, Safi said that his life had been trying to combine "love and tenderness" which are the "essence of being human" with "social justice."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRX0XlgTvzo |title=Interview with Professor Omid Safi [Eng Subs] |author=Parmida Mostafavi |date=19 April 2016 |website=YouTube}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Violent conflicts ==

=== Between Abrahamic religions ===
In most of their common history, the three Abrahamic religions have been "ignorant about each other, or worse, especially in the case of Christians and Muslims, attacked each other." In the [[La Convivencia]] (The Coexistence) in the 14th and 15th centuries, Muslims, Christians and Jews co-existed in relative peace, but, otherwise, there has been "very little genuine dialogue" between believers in these Abrahamic religions. They have "kept their distance from one another, or were in conflict. . . there has been very little genuine dialogue."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ifacs.com/the-necessity-of-inter-faith-diplomacy-the-catholicmuslim-dialogue/|title=The Necessity of Inter-Faith Diplomacy: The Catholic/Muslim Dialogue – Institute for Advanced Catholic Studies|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; An aspect La Convivencia is shown in a six-minute video [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7_GT2yqUAQ Cities of Light] that documents collaboration between [[Spanish and Portuguese Jews|Spanish Jewish]], Muslim and Christian scientists in 12th century Spain. It features the works of [[Maimonides]] (Jewish philosopher) and [[Averroes]] (Muslim philosopher).

Examples of violent conflict follow:
* Jews killed Christians during the Bar Kochba revolt.&lt;ref name="livius"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.livius.org/ja-jn/jewish_wars/bk03.html#Justin|title=Texts on Bar Kochba: Eusebius|author=Eusebius|publisher=livius.org|accessdate=14 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newadvent.org/fathers/0126.htm|title=CHURCH FATHERS: The First Apology (St. Justin Martyr)|website=Newadvent.org|accessdate=1 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The Yemeni Jewish Himyar tribe, led by King [[Dhu Nuwas]] massacred [[Christians]].&lt;ref&gt;Simon's letter is part of Part III of ''The Chronicle of Zuqnin'', translated by Amir Harrack (Toronto: [[Pontifical Institute of Medieval Studies]], 1999), pp.&amp;nbsp;78–84.&lt;/ref&gt;
* The [[Sasanian conquest and occupation of Jerusalem]] led to the massacre of Christians by Jews.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://historynewsnetwork.org/article/125435|title=What We Choose to Remember: Jerusalem in World History|website=historynewsnetwork.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The [[Byzantine–Arab Wars|wars]] between the emerging Islamic [[Caliphates]] and the Christian [[Byzantine]] or [[Eastern Roman Empire]] between the 7th and the 11th centuries CE were a series of military, political and religious conflicts which led to the Islamization of large territories in the [[Near East]] such as Egypt and Syria.
* The [[Crusades]] (end of 11th – end of 13th century CE) were a series of military expeditions from Western Europe to the Southern and Eastern Mediterranean: a rather unsuccessful response by Western (Catholic) Christians to aid their Eastern counterparts in retaking what was perceived by all Christians as the [[Holy Land]] from its Muslim inhabitants. In passing, Crusades were also marked with conflicts between Western and Eastern ([[Eastern Orthodox Church|Orthodox]], [[Syro-Jacobite]] and [[Armenians|Armenian]]) Christians and unilateral damage inflicted by Western Christians to Jews along the path of travel and in the Holy Land.
* The [[Umayyad conquest of Hispania|conquest]] and the following [[Reconquista]] of Spain, and founding of Portugal (beginning of 8th – end of 15th century CE) were a series of wars between Muslims and Christians in the [[Iberian peninsula]] resulting in the founding of several Muslim and Christian Medieval states and the final victory of the Catholic [[Crown of Castile]] and [[Aragon]] against the Muslim Emirate of [[Granada]].
* The [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] conquest of the [[Balkan peninsula]] (mid-14th – end of 15th century CE) followed by a series of wars between the Islamic [[Ottoman Empire]] and various Christian powers and alliances (end of 14th – beginning of 20th century CE) was an important political, military and cultural process for South-Eastern Europe resulting in the fall of the Eastern Roman (or Byzantine) Empire and its successor states and finally leading to the emerging of several modern nations in that region.
* The [[Spanish inquisition]] was an attempt by the Christian Catholic church in Spain in the wake of the centuries-long [[Reconquista]] to suppress or expel Jews and Muslims and to prosecute Christian heretics. Openly Jewish and Muslim people were expelled rather than killed, but many submitted to [[forced conversion]] to Catholicism to avoid expulsion. The [[Inquisitors]] often did not trust the converts, and persecuted them cruelly for being secret adherents of their original religions, which was often [[crypto-Jews|true]] but sometimes fabricated. Jewish forced converts were known as "[[anusim]]," or sometimes by the pejorative "[[morrano]] (pig)."{{citation needed|date=October 2015}}
* At various points in history [[pogroms]] against Jews were common in Christian Europe, and in many Islamic areas. See [[blood libel]].
* [[Persecution of Bahá'ís]] and [[Political accusations against the Bahá'í Faith]] review the substantive efforts in parts of the world against the Bahá'ís and their religion.

=== Between branches of the same Abrahamic religion ===
{{unreferenced section|date=June 2016}}
* The [[Fourth Crusade]] and subsequent wars between Catholic Europeans and the Orthodox Byzantine Greeks following the [[East–West Schism|Great Schism]].
* The Christian [[Reformation]] of the 16th century CE was an attempt towards a religious reform in the Catholic Christian Church which resulted in a series of [[Religious Wars]] between Catholic and emerging Reformist/Protestant Christian forces during the 16th and 17th centuries CE throughout Western Europe.
* The [[Anglo-Spanish War (1585–1604)]] was due to a religious conflict between Catholic and Protestant Christians, and economic causes.
* There have been many violent conflicts between the Sunni and Shia branches of Islam; see [[Shi'a–Sunni relations]].
* [[Post-invasion Iraq, 2003–present|After]] the [[2003 invasion of Iraq]] by a [[Coalition of the Willing|western coalition]] there was an armed conflict between branches of Islam, with fighting and bombings, even of mosques.

=== Between Abrahamic religions and non-adherents ===
{{unreferenced section|date=June 2016}}
* Religious hostility fueled the [[Maccabean Revolt|Jewish revolt against the Selucid Empire]] and [[Jewish–Roman wars]].
* Earlier Roman emperors persecuted Christians. For example, see [[Diocletianic Persecution]].
* In the initial expansion of both Christianity and Islam, a number of pagan communities were converted.
* Wars between the Hindu [[Majapahit|Majapahit Empire]] (modern-day [[Indonesia]]) and Islamic states led to the decrease of Hinduism in [[South East Asia]].
* Christian evangelism was a key motivation for the [[colonization of the Americas]].&lt;ref name="ViolentEvangelism"&gt;{{cite book|author=Luis N.

* Muslims were massacring up to 1 million Atheist, Buddhists, Christians and Hindus in [[Indonesian killings of 1965-66|1960s Indonesia]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2631">'''Avoided burden''' is an approach used in [[life-cycle assessment]] (LCA), especially in the context of allocating environmental burden in the presence of [[recycling]] or [[reuse]]. When determining the overall [[environmental impact]] of a product, the product is given "credit" for the potential recycled material included. For instance, [[Polyethylene terephthalate|PET]] bottles may be given environmental credit for the PET they contain, as this material will eventually be recycled back into further PET products.&lt;ref name="Nicholson"&gt;{{cite web|last=Nicholson|first=Anna|title=LCA allocation methods in open-loop recycling: incentivizing recycled material sourcing and creation of recyclable products|url=http://www.lcacenter.org/LCAX/presentations-final/212.pdf|accessdate=1 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; This credit is termed "avoided burden" because it refers to the impact of virgin material production that is avoided by the use of recycled material.

==Material displacement==
The extent to which recycled material displaces production of virgin material of a similar or different type is the subject of current research.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Blomberg|author2=Hellmer|title=Short-run demand and supply elasticities in the West European market for secondary aluminium|journal=Resources Policy|year=2000}}&lt;/ref&gt; In case studies, practitioners typically utilize [[heuristic]], arbitrary rules, such as assigning 100%, 50%, or 0% displacement of virgin material by recycled material.&lt;ref name="Nicholson"/&gt;&lt;ref name=geyer1&gt;{{cite web|last=Geyer |first=Roland |title=Life Cycle Inventory Analysis |url=http://www.bren.ucsb.edu/academics/courses/282/Lectures/5-IE-14-Oct-08.ppt |accessdate=1 April 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100709231634/https://www.bren.ucsb.edu/academics/courses/282/Lectures/5-IE-14-Oct-08.ppt |archivedate=9 July 2010 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  However, accurate information on the displacement rates of various materials is largely unknown. This information is important to LCA practitioners, as it can often tip the balance between two compared alternative products or materials.{{Citation needed|date=April 2011}}

==Calculation==
Although the calculation of avoided burden is not without some degree of subjectivity, it is usually calculated as follows:&lt;ref name=geyer1 /&gt; 
:''Avoided Burden = (Material Recycling Rate) × ([[Life cycle assessment#Life cycle inventory|Functional Unit]]) × [(Impact of Virgin Production) − (Impact of Recycling)]''

'''Butts Up''' (A.K.A. "Spread Eagle", "A-Ball", "Asses Up", "Assies' Rehab &amp; Tea", "Suey", "Balliver Shagnasty's Revenge", "Balls Deep", "Ballsies", "Beartrap"&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=7WVaMZAu2PEC&amp;pg=PA75&amp;dq=%22Butt+ball%22+game+ball&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=UUIkUYjGK6TI0AHKwoGACg&amp;ved=0CDYQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Butt%20ball%22%20game%20ball&amp;f=false Children's Folklore: A Handbook], p.75&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=A2xc-rivz5oC&amp;pg=PA76&amp;dq=%22Butt+ball%22+game+ball&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=UUIkUYjGK6TI0AHKwoGACg&amp;ved=0CDsQ6AEwAg#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Butt%20ball%22%20game%20ball&amp;f=false When Play Was Play: Why Pick-Up Games Matter], p 76&lt;/ref&gt; , "Blackjack" (along with many other colloquial names)) is a North American [[elementary school]] children's [[playground]] game originating in the 1950s or earlier. It is slightly similar to the game Screen Ball. Butts Up or Booties Up began in the 1940s or 1950s as a penalty phase of various city street games. Butts Up is played with a ball (such as a [[tennis ball]], [[handball]], or [[racquetball]]) on a paved surface against a wall, with a variable number of participants—usually more than three and often likely to exceed ten. Butts Up tends to be played during [[Recess (break)|recess]], before or after school. {{Citation needed|date=January 2014}}. Popular in New England is another frequent variation of [[wallball]] that usually differs a lot from the more widely known 'Butts Up'.

Players determine the variations of the game prior to start of play. Some of the rules of the game very loosely resemble the rules of [[baseball]] and [[racquetball]].

==Object of the game==
The object of the game is to be the last player remaining in the game after all other players are out.

In some variations of the game, there is no specific object of the game. Play continues until time runs out. In this variation, when players are "out" three times, they must lean against the wall and wait to be hit by the ball ("Butts Up"). See below for more on this.

==Rules of the game==
The first player, usually the tennis ball owner, starts the game or "breaks the ice" (see terminology below) by throwing the ball against the wall with the objective of having the ball hit the wall without hitting the ground first.

After the ball makes contact with the wall and bounces off the ground at least once, any of the players, including the thrower, may then try to catch the ball. If catcher mishandles the ball and the ball touches the ground, the catcher must try to touch the wall before another player fields and throws the ball against the wall. If the ball touches the wall before the catcher, the catcher is out and must face various consequences. In some places, instead of hitting the wall you have to throw it '''at''' the catcher.

If the ball is caught before hitting the [[Road surface|pavement]], the thrower is penalized with one "out", much like baseball. Some refer to this as a "cobra", or "ace". After three outs a player leaves the game. Sometimes alternate words, such as "wall," are used instead. In some cases, such as in [[New York City]], the catcher has to "peg" the thrower, while the thrower trys to touch the wall, if the thrower misses, the throwers doesn't get an out.

If the thrower's ball bounces before hitting the wall, the thrower must run to the wall and touch the wall before an opponent can pick up the ball and throw it to the wall. If the original thrower doesn't make contact with the wall before the ball reaches the wall, the original thrower is out. If the thrower reaches for the ball, but has it bounce off his fingers and onto the pavement, this counts as missing the throw, and he must run to the wall.

In one variation of the game, a runner who does not reach the wall before the thrown ball hits must, in addition to receiving an out, stand facing the wall and allow the thrower to "peg" him or her with the ball (usually with all possible force).
[[File:Buttsup.jpg|thumbnail|In the "Blue Gooch" variation of the game, the player who is "out" must keep their legs apart, so the thrower has a chance at shooting them in the perineum.]]
In another variation, when a player is "out" three times, he or she must lean against the wall, bent over with his butt in the air—hence the name of the game—and wait for the ball to be thrown at him. Other players take turns throwing the ball until he is hit. If he doesn't look back, the thrower must lob the ball in the air, but if he does, the thrower may peg him with as hard a throw as he likes. Also, in this version, the thrower must hit the player as he is running to the wall, rather than hitting the wall, to get the runner out.

The game continues until all but one player have received three outs and left the game. This form of the game is referred to as "three–out elimination".

In [[New York City]], the game is usually called "Asses Up", and the game is played exactly the same, the only major difference is that when ever a kid is "out", or doesn't touch the wall before the ball or is hit with the ball by another player, instead of eliminated after three "outs", they get eliminated when they complete the word "Asses Up" with each "out" is a letter in the game (I.e. A-S-S-E-S-U-P). This is similar with spelling out "Horse" in [[Basketball]]. Also, the term "Reach" is used when a catcher is far away, and the ball is usually thrown at the thrower as an alternative to "pegging" (usually when smaller kids are playing).

In a variation practiced widely in [[Santa Clara County, California]] elementary schools as late as the mid-1980s, each time a player earned an out, his "butt was up," and he would stand with hands against the wall, waiting to be pegged by the player who threw him out.{{Citation needed|date=March 2009}} If the player is hit in the "target area," he is convicted of the out, and gets a letter (B-U-T-T, for example), and leaves the game. In this variation, at the ice breaker's discretion, play may pass by number, i.e., Player 1 breaks the ice, then Player 2 must retrieve and throw the ball, followed by Player 3, etc. In more physical games, the ball is not required to bounce after touching the wall, and aggressive players will stand near the wall, within arms' reach, pegging other players and quickly touching the wall, then retrieving the ball and throwing the other player out. Other rules included "handsies", which prohibits players from touching the ball with both hands at once (the ball could be tossed in the air and caught with the other hand, but typically a great show was made of this feat in order to avoid even the appearance of a foul). Also, a player with ball in hand must keep one foot planted at all times, or, in the interest of justice, if a player was stranded well beyond throwing or relay distance (see "Savies"), he could take one large step toward the wall. If a player realizes he has mishandled the ball and thus must "hit the wall," and deliberately "spikes" the ball to frustrate others' attempts to throw him out, his butt is automatically up; at the other players' discretion, they may each take a turn at throwing that player out. The attack does not cease simply because a pegger has successfully scored in the target area; each player throws nonetheless, usually with intent to cause injury or disfigurement.

In more recent variations of the game, a player only receives an out if he or she is actually hit by the peg, rather than receiving it for having to be on the wall. Also, if a player wins without having gotten an out, the win is called a 'lockdown'.

In New England, specifically the Tri-State Area, another version of Wall Ball was invented. In this variation two or more people line up to take turns hitting the ball. The ball must bounce first, then hit the wall, then bounce; the next person in line must hit the ball before its second bounce on the ground, then the ball must hit the wall, then bounce. This repeats for however many people there are. It is usually played with three outs, but the number could vary depending on the amount of people. There are also many variations in each school, but the overall premise is usually the same. Wall Ball in New England is usually considered a separate game from Butts Up. In some areas in Westchester county, this variant is called "Watermelon", which is named for the legal action of going completely under the ball as a hit.

In a Maryland version of wallball, the icebreaker starts the game, with all other players nearby. Players are allowed to catch the ball if it has not bounced, as well as catching other players' throws. Failing to catch the ball, taking too long to get a handle on the ball or any other type of "bobbling" is the "bobblers" cue to touch the wall. If a player is relatively far from the wall while holding the ball, other players may call "wallball" (hence the name), meaning the player with the ball has ten seconds to hit the wall, without moving or bouncing the ball off the ground. If a player is out, he must stand on the wall and get pegged by the player who got him out. If the peg is successful (player hit), play continues with the icebreaker throwing the ball first. If the peg is unsuccessful (player not hit), other players have the opportunity to get the thrower out. No penalty besides pegging occurs from an out. Fouls include kicking the ball, preventing a player from getting you out (kicking or throwing the ball after bobbling as opposed to dropping it), tampering with a throw or interfering with a peg (interference can also occur if a player running to touch the wall is obstructed by another player.) Interference is determined by the other players in the game.

Yet another playground version of the game (popular in southern Arizona) simply had all the participants apart from the first player line up against the wall, with the immediate goal of the first player to hit a participant with the ball (typically as hard as possible) and thus make that participant "it".  This version resembles dodge ball but with the wall limiting the possible dodging moves to two dimensions rather than three.  Any participant who strayed too far away from the wall during play was "punished" by a penalty shot, where the thrower would aim solely at him or her and throw the ball as hard as possible, although a hit in this case did not make the person "it".  When a player became "it" by legal means, he or she assumed the role of "thrower".  The object of this game—like many other playground games—was simply to inflict pain on classmates, and was thus often played in relatively obscure or off-limits areas of the playground.

Another version of wallball is that the ball is catchable off the wall and the catching player can move about freely as long as they throw the ball within the next few seconds. If the ball bounces very far away from the wall the other players may call "challenge" to the player with the ball. A call of challenge means the player may not move and must throw the ball and try to hit the wall. If the player chooses to drop the ball at his/her feet then the player is automatically out. The thrower, however, may choose to simply throw it at an object that would cause the ball to be hard to get before the thrower can be thrown out, possibly causing a successive number of challenges until a suitable throw has been made. If a player catches the ball they may run to the wall and place both their off hand and foot on the wall and call "bulldog." If the player does this they can freely throw the ball at whomever they wish. If they hit another player then the hit player must touch the wall before they are thrown out. "Bulldogs" are usually frowned upon by other players and considered a cheap way of getting other players out. If a player has committed a double touch another player may call the foul and is allowed a throw at the person. The offending player must be "spread eagle" as it is called, against the wall and may not move. The thrower is not allow a full force throw unless the person moves or flinches as it is usually taken from a short distance. This can either result in a peg or a double throw depending on the rules. If the thrower makes a full force throw without the offender moving then the thrower must be pegged by the original offender. In some games the thrower on "spread eagle" must touch the wall or they too will be out, unless they missed and hit the wall.

==Terminology==
*'''Black Mail or Reach''': Once the ball is caught (usually from a long distance) any player may yell "Black Mail!" The player with the ball must now throw the ball to the wall without moving feet.
*'''Break the Ice''': To start the game by making the first throw regardless of ball ownership.
* '''Savies''' or '''Taxis''': If a player feels he is too far from the wall to throw the ball and make wall contact, the thrower can throw the ball to another player and hope the receiver will wait until the thrower has run to the wall and touched it. However, savies can backfire if the catcher betrays the thrower by throwing the ball to the wall before the thrower has run and touched the wall. In some places, there is no betrayal as, if you save them they don't have to run.
*'''Chicken Drops''': An alternative to Savies. If a player is too far from the wall to make a complete pass to hit the wall, he can drop the ball at his feet and head to the wall as quickly as he can to make contact. If another player picks up the ball that player can throw the runner out by getting the ball to the wall before the runner. This technique is frowned upon by Butts Up enthusiasts.
*'''Double Touch''': The act of a player touching the ball twice, resulting in an automatic out. Typically this occurs when the ball is bobbled or tripped over.
*'''Handsies''': (Some variations) The act of a player touching the ball with both hands at once, resulting in an obligation to "hit the wall".
*'''Hit the Wall''': Alternative terminology for a player's obligation, upon committing "handsies," "chicken drops," "traveling," or other offense, failure to accomplish which before any other player has thrown the player out by causing it to hit the wall results in an out or the runner's butt being "up".
*'''Peg''': A player throws the ball at another player, usually resulting in an out for both players.
*'''Self-Out''': A player throws the ball to the wall and then catches it before the ball hits the pavement. This rule is optional and can be determined by the players prior to the start of the game.
*'''Self-Peg''': A thrower's ball bounces off the wall and hits the thrower. In this case the thrower must run to the wall and touch the wall before an opponent picks up the ball and throws it to the wall.
*'''Stripping''': In more physical iterations of the game, a player may attempt to strip the ball from the hand of another player. If successful, both players must run to the wall to avoid earning an out.
*'''Tie Goes to the Runner''': If there is a dispute among the players about whether a runner is safe or out, and the decision for and against is a 50/50 tie among players, the runner stays in the game.
*'''Traveling''': The act of a player moving both feet with ball in hand.
*'''Lockdown''': Occurs when a player wins the game without having gotten out.
*'''Poison''': When someone catches the ball without the ball hitting the ground. If they say "poison" the "poisoned" person must run to the wall before the person who caught the ball throws it to the wall.

{{For|the Goodie Mob song|Cell Therapy (song)}}
'''Cell therapy''' (also called '''cellular therapy''' or '''cytotherapy''') is [[therapy]] in which cellular material is injected into a patient;&lt;ref name=acs/&gt; this generally means intact, living [[cell (biology)|cells]]. For example, [[T cell]]s capable of fighting [[cancer]] cells via [[cell-mediated immunity]] may be injected in the course of [[immunotherapy]].

Cell therapy originated in the nineteenth century when scientists experimented by injecting animal material in an attempt to prevent and treat illness.&lt;ref name=testicles/&gt; Although such attempts produced no positive benefit, further research found in the mid twentieth century that human cells could be used to help prevent the human body rejecting transplanted organs, leading in time to successful bone marrow transplantation.&lt;ref name=starzl/&gt;

Today two distinct categories of cell therapy are recognized.&lt;ref name=acs/&gt;

The first category is cell therapy in mainstream medicine. This is the subject of intense research and the basis of potential therapeutic benefit.&lt;ref name=gage/&gt; Such research can be controversial when it involves [[human embryo]]nic material.

The second category is in [[Complementary and alternative medicine|alternative medicine]], and perpetuates the practice of injecting animal materials in an attempt to cure disease. This practice, according to the [[American Cancer Society]], is not backed by any [[medical evidence]] of effectiveness, and can have deadly consequences.&lt;ref name=acs/&gt;

==Background==
[[File:Charles-Édouard Brown-Séquard.jpg|right|thumb|[[Charles-Édouard Brown-Séquard]]&amp;nbsp;&amp;ndash; tried to stop aging by injecting animal testicle extract]]
Cell therapy can be defined as therapy in which cellular material is injected into a patient.&lt;ref name=acs/&gt;

There are two branches of cell therapy: one is legitimate and established, whereby human cells are transplanted from a donor to a patient; the other is dangerous [[Complementary and alternative medicine|alternative]] medicine, whereby injected animal cells are used to attempt to treat illness.&lt;ref name=acs/&gt;

The origins of cell therapy can perhaps be traced to the nineteenth century, when [[Charles-Édouard Brown-Séquard]] (1817–1894) injected animal testicle extracts in an attempt to stop the effects of aging.&lt;ref name=testicles&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1016/j.ando.2010.01.003|title=La thérapeutique du docteur Brown-Séquard|year=2010|last1=Lefrère|first1=J.-J.|last2=Berche|first2=P.|journal=Annales d'Endocrinologie|volume=71|issue=2|pages=69–75|url=http://www.em-consulte.com/en/article/249670}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1931 [[Paul Niehans]] (1882–1971)&amp;nbsp;&amp;ndash; who has been called the inventor of cell therapy&amp;nbsp;&amp;ndash; attempted to cure a patient by injecting material from calf embryos.&lt;ref name="acs"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cancer.org/treatment/treatmentsandsideeffects/complementaryandalternativemedicine/pharmacologicalandbiologicaltreatment/cell-therapy|title=Cell Therapy|date=1 November 2008|publisher=[[American Cancer Society]]|accessdate=15 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Niehans claimed to have treated many people for cancer using this technique, though his claims have never been validated by research.&lt;ref name=acs/&gt;

In 1953 researchers found that laboratory animals could be helped not to reject organ transplants by pre-inoculating them with cells from donor animals; in 1968, in Minnesota, the first successful human bone marrow transplantation took place.&lt;ref name=starzl&gt;{{cite journal|pmid=10833242|year=2000|last1=Starzl|first1=TE|title=History of clinical transplantation|volume=24|issue=7|pages=759–82|doi=10.1007/s002680010124|pmc=3091383|journal=World Journal of Surgery}}&lt;/ref&gt; In more recent work, [[cell encapulation]] is pursued as a means to shield therapeutic cells from the host immune response. Recent work includes micro-encapsulating cells in a gel core surrounded by a solid, but permeable, shell.&lt;ref name="Zhou etal"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors= Zhou X, Haraldsson T, Nania S, Ribet F, Palano G, Heuchel R, Löhr M, van der Wijngaart W |title= Human Cell Encapsulation in Gel Microbeads with Cosynthesized Concentric Nanoporous Solid Shells |journal=Adv. Funct. Mater. |year=2018 |doi=10.1002/adfm.201707129}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bone marrow transplants have been found to be effective, along with some other kinds of human cell therapy&amp;nbsp;&amp;ndash; for example in treating damaged knee [[cartilage]].&lt;ref name=acs/&gt; In recent times, cell therapy using human material has been recognized as an important field in the treatment of human disease.&lt;ref name=gage&gt;{{cite journal|pmid=9579857|year=1998|last1=Gage|first1=FH|title=Cell therapy|volume=392|issue=6679 Suppl|pages=18–24|journal=Nature}}&lt;/ref&gt; The experimental field of [[Stem cell therapy]] has shown promise for new types of treatment.&lt;ref name=acs/&gt;

In mainstream medicine, cell therapy is supported by a distinct healthcare industry which sees strong prospects for future growth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1016/j.stem.2011.10.010|title=The Impact of Market Volatility on the Cell Therapy Industry|year=2011|last1=Brindley|first1=David A.|last2=Reeve|first2=Brock C.|last3=Sahlman|first3=William A.|last4=Bonfiglio|first4=Greg A.|last5=Davie|first5=Natasha L.|last6=Culme-Seymour|first6=Emily J.|last7=Mason|first7=Chris|journal=Cell Stem Cell|volume=9|issue=5|pages=397–401|pmid=22056137}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Mason|first=C |author2=Brindley, DA |author3=Culme-Seymour, EJ |author4=Davie, NL|title=Cell therapy industry: billion dollar global business with unlimited potential.|journal=Regenerative medicine|date=May 2011|volume=6|issue=3|pages=265–72|pmid=21548728|doi=10.2217/rme.11.28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Research into human embryonic stem cells is [[Stem cell controversy|controversial]], and [[Stem cell research policy|regulation]] varies from country to country, with some countries banning it outright. Nevertheless,  these cells are being investigated as the basis for a number of therapeutic applications, including possible treatments for [[diabetes]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|pmid=17053790|year=2006|last1=d'Amour|first1=KA|last2=Bang|first2=AG|last3=Eliazer|first3=S|last4=Kelly|first4=OG|last5=Agulnick|first5=AD|last6=Smart|first6=NG|last7=Moorman|first7=MA|last8=Kroon|first8=E|last9=Carpenter|first9=MK|last10=Baetge|first10=EE|title=Production of pancreatic hormone-expressing endocrine cells from human embryonic stem cells|volume=24|issue=11|pages=1392–401|doi=10.1038/nbt1259|journal=Nature Biotechnology}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Parkinson's disease.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|pmid=17627139|year=2007|last1=Parish|first1=CL|last2=Arenas|first2=E|title=Stem-cell-based strategies for the treatment of Parkinson's disease|volume=4|issue=4|pages=339–47|doi=10.1159/000101892|journal=Neuro-Degenerative Diseases}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Mechanisms of Action===
Cell therapy is targeted at many clinical indications in multiple organs and by several modes of cell delivery. Accordingly, the specific mechanisms of action involved in the therapies are wide-ranging. However, there are two main principles by which cells facilitate therapeutic action:

#Stem cell or progenitor cell engraftment, differentiation, and long term replacement of damaged tissue. In this paradigm multipotent or unipotent cells differentiate into a specific cell type in the lab or after reaching the site of injury (via local or systemic administration). These cells then integrate into the site of injury, replacing damaged tissue, and thus facilitate improved function of the organ or tissue. An example of this is the use of cells to replace cardiomyocytes after myocardial infarction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Jackson K. A. | author2 = Majka S. M. | year = 2001 | title = Regeneration of ischemic cardiac muscle and vascular endothelium by adult stem cells | journal = J Clin Invest | volume = 107 | issue = 11| pages = 1395–402 | doi=10.1172/jci12150|display-authors=etal | pmid=11390421 | pmc=209322}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Kawada H. | author2 = Fujita J. | year = 2004 | title = Nonhematopoietic mesenchymal stem cells can be mobilized and differentiate into cardiomyocytes after myocardial infarction | url = | journal = Blood | volume = 104 | issue = 12| pages = 3581–7 | doi=10.1182/blood-2004-04-1488|display-authors=etal | pmid=15297308}}&lt;/ref&gt;
#Cells that have the capacity to release soluble factors such as cytokines, chemokines, and growth factors which act in a paracrine or endocrine manner. These factors facilitate self-healing of the organ or region. The delivered cells (via local or systemic administration) remain viable for a relatively short period (days-weeks) and then die. This includes cells that naturally secrete the relevant therapeutic factors, or which undergo epigenetic changes or genetic engineering that causes the cells to release large quantities of a specific molecule. Examples of this include cells that secrete factors which facilitate angiogenesis, anti-inflammation, and anti-apoptosis.&lt;ref&gt;Deuse, T., C. Peter, et al. (2009). "Hepatocyte growth factor or vascular endothelial growth factor gene transfer maximizes mesenchymal stem cell-based myocardial salvage after acute myocardial infarction." ''Circulation'' 120(11 Suppl): S247-54.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Kelly M.

===Neural Stem Cell Therapy===
{{see also|Neural stem cell}}
Neural stem cells (NSCs) are the subject of ongoing research for possible therapeutic applications, for example for treating a number of neurological disorders such as [[Parkinson's disease]] and [[Huntington's disease]].&lt;ref name=Bonnamain&gt;{{cite journal|pmid=22514520|year=2012|last1=Bonnamain|first1=V|last2=Neveu|first2=I|last3=Naveilhan|first3=P|title=Neural stem/progenitor cells as a promising candidate for regenerative therapy of the central nervous system|volume=6|pages=17|doi=10.3389/fncel.2012.00017|pmc=3323829|journal=Frontiers in Cellular Neuroscience}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Mesenchymal Stem Cell Therapy===
{{see also|Mesenchymal stem cell}}
MSCs are immunomodulatory, multipotent and fast proliferating and these unique capabilities mean they can be used for a wide range of treatments including immune-modulatory therapy, bone and cartilage regeneration, myocardium regeneration and the treatment of [[Hurler syndrome]], a skeletal and neurological disorder.&lt;ref name="oh"&gt;Oh SKW and Choo ABH (2011) The Biological Basis | Stem Cells. In: Murray Moo-Young (ed.), Comprehensive Biotechnology, Second Edition, Volume 1, pp. 341–365. Elsevier.&lt;/ref&gt;

Researchers have demonstrated the use of MSCs for the treatment of [[osteogenesis imperfecta]] (OI). Horwitz et al. transplanted bone marrow (BM) cells from [[human leukocyte antigen]] (HLA)-identical siblings to patients suffering from OI. Results show that MSCs can develop into normal osteoblasts, leading to fast bone development and reduced fracture frequencies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Horwitz EM, Prockop DJ, Gordon PL | year = 1999 | title = Transplantability and therapeutic effects of bone marrow-derived mesenchymal cells in children with osteogenesis imperfecta | pmid = 10086387 | journal = Nature Medicine | volume = 5 | issue = | pages = 309–313 |display-authors=etal|doi=10.1038/6529 }}&lt;/ref&gt;   A more recent clinical trial showed that allogeneic fetal MSCs transplanted in utero in patients with severe OI can engraft and differentiate into bone in a human fetus.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Le Blanc K, Götherström C, Ringdén O | year = 2005 | title = Fetal mesenchymal stem-cell engraftment in bone after in utero transplantation in a patient with severe osteogenesis imperfecta | url = | journal = Transplantation | volume = 79 | issue = | pages = 1607–1614 | doi=10.1097/01.tp.0000159029.48678.93|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Besides bone and cartilage regeneration, cardiomyocyte regeneration with autologous BM MSCs has also been reported recently. Introduction of BM MSCs following [[myocardial infarction]] (MI) resulted in significant reduction of damaged regions and improvement in heart function.  Clinical trials for treatment of acute MI with Prochymal by Osiris Therapeutics are underway. Also, a clinical trial revealed huge improvements in nerve conduction velocities in Hurler’s Syndrome patients infused with BM MSCs from HLA-identical siblings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Koç ON, Day J, Nieder M | year = 2002 | title = Allogeneic mesenchymal stem cell infusion for treatment of Metachromatic Leukodystrophy (MLD) and Hurler syndrome (MPS-IH) | url = | journal = Bone Marrow Transplant | volume = 30 | issue = | pages = 215–222 | doi=10.1038/sj.bmt.1703650|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation===
{{main|Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation}}
HSCs possess the ability to self-renew and differentiate into all types of blood cells, especially those involved in the human immune system. Thus, they can be used to treat blood and immune disorders. Since human bone marrow (BM) grafting was first published in 1957,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Thomas ED, ((Lochte HL Jr)), Cannon JH | year = 1959 | title = Supralethal whole body irradiation and isologous marrow transplantation in man | journal = Journal of Clinical Investigation | volume = 38 | issue = | pages = 1709–1716 | doi=10.1172/jci103949|display-authors=etal | pmid=13837954 | pmc=444138}}&lt;/ref&gt; there have been significant advancements in HSCs therapy. Following that, syngeneic marrow infusion&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Van Der Berg DJ, Sharma AK, Bruno E, Hoffman R | year = 1998 | title = Role of members of the Wnt gene family in human hematopoiesis | url = | journal = Blood | volume = 92 | issue = | pages = 3189–3202 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and allogeneic marrow grafting&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Wilson A, Trumpp A | year = 2006 | title = Bone-marrow haematopoietic stem-cell niches | url = | journal = Nature Immunology | volume = 6 | issue = | pages = 93–106 | doi=10.1038/nri1779}}&lt;/ref&gt; were performed successfully. HSCs therapy can also render its cure by reconstituting damaged blood-forming cells and restoring the immune system after high-dose chemotherapy to eliminate disease.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Hwang WYK | year = 2004 | title = Haematopoietic graft engineering | url = | journal = Annals, Academy of Medicine, Singapore | volume = 33 | issue = | pages = 551–558 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are three types of HSCT: syngeneic, autologous, and allogeneic transplants.&lt;ref name="oh" /&gt;  Syngeneic transplantations occur between identical twins. Autologous transplantations use the HSCs obtained directly from the patient and hence do not cause any complications of tissue incompatibility; whereas allogeneic transplantations involve the use of donor HSCs, either genetically related or unrelated to the recipient. To lower the risks of transplant, which include graft rejection and Graft-Versus-Host Disease (GVHD), allogeneic HSCT must satisfy compatibility at the HLA loci (i.e. genetic matching to reduce the immunogenicity of the transplant). Mismatch of HLA loci would result in treatment-related mortality and higher risk of acute GVHD.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = ((Hwang WYK)), Ong SY | year = 2009 | title = Allogeneic haematopoietic stem cell transplantation without a matched sibling donor: Current options and future potential | url = | journal = Annals, Academy of Medicine, Singapore | volume = 38 | issue = | pages = 340–345 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to BM derived HSCs, the use of alternative sources such as umbilical cord blood (UCB) and peripheral blood stem cells (PBSCs) has been increasing. In comparison with BM derived HSCs recipients, PBSCs recipients afflicted with myeloid malignancies reported a faster engraftment and better overall survival.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Bhardwaj G, Murdoch B, Wu D | year = 2001 | title = Sonic hedgehog induces the proliferation of primitive human hematopoietic cells via BMP regulation | doi = 10.1038/84282| journal = Nature Immunology | volume = 2 | issue = | pages = 172–180 |display-authors=etal|pmid=11175816}}&lt;/ref&gt;  However, this was at the expense of increased rate of GVHD.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Couban S, Simpson DR, Barnett MJ | year = 2002 | title = A randomized multicenter comparison of bone marrow and peripheral blood in recipients of matched sibling allogeneic transplants for myeloid malignancies | url = | journal = Blood | volume = 100 | issue = | pages = 1525–1531 | doi=10.1182/blood-2002-01-0048|display-authors=etal | pmid=12176866}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Also, the use of UCB requires less stringent HLA loci matching, although the time of engraftment is longer and graft failure rate is higher.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Sharma S, Gurudutta GU, Satija NK | year = 2006 | title = Stem cell c-KIT and HOXB4 genes: Critical roles and mechanisms in self-renewal, proliferation and differentiation | url = | journal = Stem Cells and Development | volume = 15 | issue = | pages = 755–778 | doi=10.1089/scd.2006.15.755|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Thomas ED, Storb R | year = 1970 | title = Technique for human marrow grafting | url = | journal = Blood | volume = 36 | issue = | pages = 507–515 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In alternative medicine==
{{see also|List of ineffective cancer treatments}}
In alternative medicine, cell therapy is defined as the injection of non-human cellular animal material in an attempt to treat illness.&lt;ref name=acs/&gt; [[Quackwatch]] labels this as "senseless", since "cells from the organs of one species cannot replace the cells from the organs of other species" and because a number of serious adverse effects have been reported.&lt;ref name=qw&gt;{{cite web
|url=http://www.quackwatch.org/01QuackeryRelatedTopics/Cancer/cellular.html
|title=Cellular Therapy
|author=Stephen Barrett, M.D.
|date=21 August 2003
|publisher=[[Quackwatch]]
|accessdate=15 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Of this alternative, animal-based form of cell therapy, the [[American Cancer Society]] say: "Available scientific evidence does not support claims that cell therapy is effective in treating cancer or any other disease. It may in fact be lethal ...".&lt;ref name=acs/&gt;

'''Community archaeology''' is [[archaeology]] by the people for the people.  The field is also known as public archaeology. There is debate about whether the terms are interchangeable; some believe that community archaeology is but one form of public archaeology, which can include many other modes of practice, in addition what is described here.&lt;ref&gt;The terms are interchangeable in McDavid (2002:304) and Marshall (2002:214)&lt;/ref&gt;  The design, goals, involved communities, and methods in community archaeology projects vary greatly, but there are two general aspects found in all community archaeology projects.  First, community archaeology involves communities "in the planning and carrying out of research projects that are of direct interest to them".&lt;ref&gt;Trigger (2007:260)&lt;/ref&gt;  Second, community archaeologists generally believe they are making an altruistic difference.  Many scholars on the subject have argued that community collaboration does not have a pre-set method to follow.&lt;ref&gt;Kerber (2006a:xxx)&lt;/ref&gt;  Although not found in every project, there are a number of recurring purposes and goals in community archaeology.  Similarities are also found in different countries and regions—due to commonalities in archaeological communities, laws, institutions, and types of communities. It has also been suggested that public archaeology can be defined in a broad sense as the production and consumption of archaeological "commodities".&lt;ref&gt;Moshenska (2009)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Community archaeology by country==

===Community archaeology in the United States===
In the United States community archaeology can broadly be separated into three distinct types: projects that collaborate with [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|American Indians]], projects that collaborate with other [[local and descendant communities]], and outreach specifically for [[public education]].

===American Indians===
Archaeologists have a long history of excavating American Indian sites without consulting or collaborating with American Indians.  Points of tension include, but are not limited to, the excavation and collection of human remains, the destruction and collections of sacred sites and objects, and archaeological interpretations that ignored or contradicted the opinions and beliefs of American Indians.&lt;ref&gt;Watkins (2003, 2006)&lt;/ref&gt;  Even the so-called ‘father of American archaeology’ [[Thomas Jefferson]] excavated adults and sub-adults from a site still visited by American Indians&lt;ref&gt;Atalay (2006:286-288)&lt;/ref&gt; and Pilgrims plundered an American Indian grave days after anchoring at [[Cape Cod]].&lt;ref&gt;Watkins (2006:xi)&lt;/ref&gt;  Indeed, “American Indians tend to equate archaeologists with pothunters, grave looters, or, even worse, animals who feast off of the dead (i.e., the “Vulture Culture”).  Most do not trust the system supposedly designed to protect their heritage.”&lt;ref&gt;Watkins (2003:134)&lt;/ref&gt;  Also, any prehistoric archaeological excavation in the Americas will involve the material products left by the ancestors of American Indians.  For these reasons, community archaeology projects   with both federally and non-federally recognized American Indians are different from those that collaborate with local and other descent communities.  Some have found that collaboration can be a means to “break down barriers” between American Indians and archaeologists, and that in collaboration “[e]ach side learns something from the other.”&lt;ref&gt;Dean and Perrelli (2006:141-142)&lt;/ref&gt;  There are many unique ways archaeological collaboration can benefit American Indians.  Kerber reports that:
&lt;blockquote&gt;. . . archaeology benefits American Indians and First People of Canada, respectively, by contributing important historical information; assisting in land claims; managing cultural resources and burial for protection from current and future impacts; promoting sovereignty; offering employment opportunities through field work, interpretive centers, and tourism; educating the young; aiding in nation (re-)building and self-discovery; demonstrating innovative responses of past groups to changing environmental and social circumstance; and providing populations themselves with skills and experience in doing archaeology.  Clearly, collaborative archaeology is not a panacea for the difficulties facing indigenous groups, but in certain situations . . . it can be a powerful tool&lt;ref&gt;Kerber (2006a:xxii)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Dean and Perrelli have noted that collaboration with American Indians is only new “from the perspective of the dominant culture”&lt;ref&gt;Dean and Perrelli (2006:144)&lt;/ref&gt; and that “American Indian people have been cooperating and collaborating with their neighbors and visitors for hundreds of years.”&lt;ref&gt;Dean and Perrelli (2006:145)&lt;/ref&gt;
Some have argued that archaeologists should attempt to collaborate and repatriate materials to non-federally recognized tribes in addition to federally recognized ones.&lt;ref&gt;Watkins (2003)&lt;/ref&gt;  Blume has contended that when collaborating with American Indians should design "forms of public outreach specifically for the Indian audience."&lt;ref&gt;Blume (2006:198)&lt;/ref&gt;  Many recognized and non-recognized tribes have explicitly asked archaeologists for consolation and collaboration.&lt;ref&gt;See Marshall (2002) and cases in Kerber (2006b)&lt;/ref&gt;
Two particularly well known examples of indigenous collaboration are [[Janet Spector]]’s book [[What does this Awl Mean]] and the [[Ozette Indian Village Archeological Site]].&lt;ref&gt;See Marshall (2002:212-214); Spector (1993)&lt;/ref&gt;  Collaborations have occurred throughout the United States, including with [[Alaska Natives]].&lt;ref&gt;See Knecht (2003); Hollowell-Zimmer (2003); Hollowell (2006)&lt;/ref&gt;  Many tribes have also begun hiring full-time tribal archaeologists.

====Local and descendent communities====
Many other community archaeology projects occur in the United States aside from those with American Indians.  These projects focus on [[local communities]], [[descendent communities]], and descendent [[diasporas]].&lt;ref&gt;See Singleton and Orser (2003)&lt;/ref&gt;  A goal of some of these projects has been to recover and publicly present forgotten aspects of the race relations in local communities—such as histories of slavery and segregation.&lt;ref&gt;See McDavid (2002, 2003); Singleton and Orser (2003); Shackel (2007)&lt;/ref&gt;

====Public education====
As a form of public outreach and collaboration, many archaeology projects in the United States have taken steps to present their work in schools and to children.  These projects vary from a "one time" presentation to local schools, to long-term commitments in which public education is an intricate part of the research design.&lt;ref&gt;De Cunzo and Jameson (2007); Jeppson and Brauer (2007); Atalay (2007); Wille (2008)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Community archaeology in the United Kingdom===

====History====
Community archaeology in the United Kingdom has existed for many years, although only recently has it come to be known by that name.  The roots of archaeology in the United Kingdom lie in the tradition of antiquarian and amateur work,&lt;ref&gt;Also see Trigger (2007)&lt;/ref&gt; and many county or locally based archaeology and history societies founded over a century ago have continued to enable the involvement of local people in archaeology.  Up until the 1970s volunteers often had opportunities to initiate or take part in archaeological investigations.  Since then the recognition that more investigations were required by the subsequent establishment of archaeological units eroded some of these opportunities; more significantly the introduction of archaeology to the legalities of the planning process through Planning Policy Guidance note 16 (PPG16) and the full professionalization of archaeology, has made public participation in archaeology extremely limited.

====Public participation====
Archaeology (including historic buildings, landscapes and monuments, as well as ‘traditional’ archaeology) is about people and the discovery of the past.  As a subject, archaeology in the United Kingdom has been increasingly brought into the public eye in recent years.  The most common form of community archaeology in the United Kingdom has come from the grass roots level. Local groups are smaller than the large, county societies, and operate in their own area and at their own pace. The work produced is often of a high standard, reflecting the amount of time and effort local people are willing to put into local projects they themselves initiated.  Increasingly, over the last two decades, public participation has been pushed aside by developer-led, commercial archaeology, with the bulk of work going to contracting units. The reasons behind this relate to the professionalization of the discipline and the implementation of PPG16, as discussed by Faulkner who proposed a return to community-led archaeology in his article entitled “Archaeology from below”.&lt;ref&gt;See Faulkner (2000) and Faulkner (2001/2002)&lt;/ref&gt;
A recent investigation carried out by the Council for British Archaeology&lt;ref&gt;See Farley (2003)&lt;/ref&gt; identified the main perceived barriers to public participation, gave examples of good practice in encouraging public participation, and made several recommendations for future improvements.  Its first recommendation was the establishment of full-time Community Archaeologist posts across the country, as it states, “such dedicated posts represent a very effective way of stimulating and guiding public participation at a local level.”&lt;ref&gt;Farley (2003:14)&lt;/ref&gt;
One of the longest running and most successful community archaeology projects is based in Leicestershire.&lt;ref&gt;Schadla-Hall (forthcoming)&lt;/ref&gt; Leicestershire County Council (which incorporates the museum service) established the project in 1976 and today they have 400 members within 20 local groups across the county. Peter Liddle (Keeper of Archaeology) is the Community Archaeologist and was probably the first to use the term ‘community archaeology’ as the title for his fieldworker’s handbook.&lt;ref&gt;See Liddle (1985)&lt;/ref&gt;

====The Valletta Convention====
The Valletta Convention affects the work of non-official or amateur groups who have been, or are, investigating their local historic environment.  The European Convention on the Protection of the Archaeological Heritage (Revised) was signed in Valletta in 1992, and ratified by the UK government before coming into force on 21 March 2001.&lt;ref&gt;http://new.archaeologyuk.org/&lt;/ref&gt; Article 3 of the document caused considerable debate as it stated that all archaeological work should be carried out by suitably qualified, authorized people.&lt;ref&gt;Current Archaeology (2001a; 2001b)&lt;/ref&gt; This form of ‘licensing’ for archaeologists already exists in the rest of Europe, where it has limited the work of voluntary archaeologists and local societies.

===Community archaeology in Australia ===
Australian Community Archaeology has a long history of community archaeology, with established disciplines and laws.&lt;ref name="Marshall 2002"&gt;Marshall (2002)&lt;/ref&gt;  In her review of community archaeology, Marshall found that there is an “antipodean dominance” in field community archaeology, suggesting that Australian community archaeology may be more established as a discipline than in other countries.&lt;ref&gt;Marshall (2002:212)&lt;/ref&gt;  This is reflected in anthologies on community archaeology in Harrison and Williamson&lt;ref&gt;Harrison and Williamson (2002)&lt;/ref&gt; and Colley.&lt;ref&gt;Colley (2002)&lt;/ref&gt;  Generally Australian community archaeology projects have involved collaboration between archaeologists and aboriginal tribes similar to archaeologists in the United States collaborate with American Indians.&lt;ref&gt;Marshall (2002); Fredericksen (2002); Clarke (2002)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Community archaeology outside of the United States, the United Kingdom, and Australia===
Hundreds, if not thousands, of community archaeology projects have occurred throughout the world—including in Brazil,&lt;ref&gt;Funari et al. (2007); Najjar and Najjar (2007)&lt;/ref&gt; Canada,&lt;ref&gt;Friesen (2002); Doroszenko (2007); Fry (2007); Hansen and Fowler (2007); Pope and Mills (2007)&lt;/ref&gt; Egypt,&lt;ref&gt;Moser et al. (2002)&lt;/ref&gt; Mexico,&lt;ref&gt;Breglia, (2007); Rodriguez, (2006)&lt;/ref&gt; the People's Republic of Bangladesh,&lt;ref&gt;Sen (2002)&lt;/ref&gt; South Africa,&lt;ref&gt;Segobye (2005)&lt;/ref&gt; Thailand (Praicharnjit 2006, www.archaeopen.com)and Turkey.&lt;ref name="Atalay 2007"&gt;Atalay (2007)&lt;/ref&gt;  Wikipedia would greatly appreciate if scholars, students, or members of communities affiliated with Community Archaeology projects would contribute to this page.

==Communities==

===Definitions===
In a reduced sense, [[communities]] are aggregations of people that “are seldom, if ever, monocultural and are never of one mind.”&lt;ref&gt;Marshall (2002:215)&lt;/ref&gt;  For understanding the goals of community archaeology projects it is helpful to classify these communities into three broad and overlapping types.  That is local communities, local descent communities, and non-local descent communities or [[diaspora]]s.”&lt;ref&gt;Marshall (2002:216); Singleton and Orser (2003:144)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Local communities and non-local descent communities===
Descent communities are those ancestrally linked to a site.  Descent communities located within proximity of the site are local descent communities, and non-local descent communities “are groups that are linked to a site, but that live in another location, potentially hundreds or even thousands of miles away.”&lt;ref&gt;Singleton and Orser (2003:144)&lt;/ref&gt;  Archaeological collaborations with local descent communities include those that focus on proto-historic sites and collaborate with American Indians ancestrally linked to them, or plantation excavations that incorporate collaborations with the local ancestors of slaves who worked at the plantation.&lt;ref&gt;Hollowell (2006); Hollowell-Zimmer (2003); Singleton (2003); Shackel (2007); McDavid (2003); McDavid (2002)&lt;/ref&gt;  Examples of community projects involving non-local descent communities include those where archaeologists set up museums for non-locals to come and visit.&lt;ref&gt;Knecht (2003); Smith et al. (2003); Jones and McBride (2006); Wille (2008)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Non-descent local communities===
Local communities are simply communities that live “either on or close to a site”&lt;ref&gt;Marshall (2002:216)&lt;/ref&gt; and non-descent local communities are those not believed ancestrally related to the site. This category includes landowners, local volunteers, local organizations, and local stakeholders.  Some feel that many of the major issues in community archaeology are applicable to non-local descent communities, and that these collaborations are crucial for archaeologists seeking to understand the local social context of their work.&lt;ref name="Atalay 2007"/&gt;

==Major issues==

===Decolonization of archaeology===
Archaeology is a practice whose history is entrenched in [[colonialism]], and many archaeologists and communities contend that archaeology has never escaped its [[colonial past]].&lt;ref&gt;See Pyburn (2003); Pyburn (2004); Atalay (2006); Trigger (2007); Pyburn (2008b)&lt;/ref&gt;  A major goal of many community archaeologists and community archaeology projects is to [[decolonize]] archaeology.&lt;ref&gt;Atalay (2006); Pyburn (2008a); Pyburn (2004); Spector (1993)&lt;/ref&gt;  In decolonizing archaeology, archaeologists are trying to give communities more control over every stage in the archaeological process.  For example, some programs have begun attempting to bring Indigenous leaders together globally to discuss shared methods for decolonization through archaeological collaboration.&lt;ref&gt;See Atalay (2006), Atalay (2007), Pyburn (2008b)&lt;/ref&gt;    Community archaeology, the sharing of archaeological knowledge, and the below major issues have been viewed as a crucial parts of decolonization.&lt;ref&gt;Atalay (2006); Pyburn (2008a); Pyburn (2004)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Self-reflexivity===
Community archaeology can alleviate or prevent violence towards communities that archaeology may cause.  Self-reflexivity in archaeology can be thought of as looking into a metaphorical mirror, and includes attempts to make explicitly make visible the violence—such as colonization—archaeology has been implicitly part of.&lt;ref name="Spector 1993"&gt;Spector (1993)&lt;/ref&gt;  Self-reflexivity in archaeology can be part of community presentation, as a means of breaking down imbalanced power dynamics between non-academic communities and archaeologists.&lt;ref&gt;Moser et al. (2002:234)&lt;/ref&gt;  Self-reflection amongst archaeologists—such as discussion with community members, writing field journals, and professional writings about self-reflection—can also be a means for identifying unethical and violent aspects of archaeological projects.&lt;ref&gt;Edgeworth (2006)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Public outreach===
Public [[outreach]], in archaeology, is a form of [[science outreach]] that attempts to present archaeological findings to non-archaeologists.  Public outreach is usually a crucial aspect of most community archaeology projects.&lt;ref&gt;Specter (1993); Herscher and McManamon (1995); Jameson (2003); Lynott (2003) Wille (2008)&lt;/ref&gt;  Public outreach can take many forms, from a onetime presentation to a local school to long-term agreements with local communities in developing intricate public outreach programs.&lt;ref name="Atalay 2007"/&gt;  Many feel that archaeology and archaeological findings have been greatly distorted by the popular media and through western associations, and that public outreach is the only way non-archaeologists will be able to understand what archaeologists actually do and find.&lt;ref&gt;Pyburn (2008a)&lt;/ref&gt;
On another level, public participation can mean local people taking part in training excavations, and this type of involvement results in a hands-on learning experience in archaeological techniques.

==Approaches to community archaeology==

===Community interpretation===
Interpretation of archaeological findings by the community is a quintessential aspect of community archaeology, and is viewed as an important aspect of “decolonizing archaeology” and giving non-archaeologists power to interpreting the past.&lt;ref&gt;Atalay (2006)&lt;/ref&gt;   Multiple community archaeologists have created projects that give the community a major role in the interpretation and dissemination of archaeological information.&lt;ref name="Marshall 2002"/&gt;  Community participation is not relegated to the interpretation of discoveries but includes contributions to any aspect of archaeology—such as theory&lt;ref&gt;See [[de-centering]] in Atalay (2006)&lt;/ref&gt; and project goals.&lt;ref&gt;Clarke (2002); Moser et al. (2002); Kuhns (2008); Watson and Waterman (2008)&lt;/ref&gt;   Community involvement ends the exclusive control that archaeologists have had over the material past, and gives non-archaeologists a chance to interpret the past.&lt;ref name="Spector 1993"/&gt;  Many archaeologists now argue that the incorporation of local knowledge is important to archaeology’s survival as an academic discipline.&lt;ref&gt;Miller (1980); Watkins (2003)&lt;/ref&gt;  The degree of interpretive control communities have in archaeological projects vary from using interpretations garnered from interviews and consultations,&lt;ref&gt;Sanger et al. (2006:325)&lt;/ref&gt;  to academic publication written by community members based on community identified research questions.&lt;ref&gt;See Wiynjorroc et al. (2005); Dean and Perrelli (2006)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Long-term commitment===
Ethnographers and development specialists have shown&lt;ref name="Pyburn 2007:177"&gt;Pyburn (2007:177)&lt;/ref&gt; that a long-term relationship is necessary to develop a rapport and mutual respect with the local community, and argue that to succeed at collaboration archaeologists must make a long-term commitment&lt;ref&gt;Pyburn (2003)&lt;/ref&gt;  in order to understand the dynamics of the social context of their research. Without this depth of knowledge archaeologists risk making decisions with unintended consequences.&lt;ref name="Pyburn 2007"&gt;Pyburn (2007)&lt;/ref&gt;  For example, collaborations and repatriations have been more successful where archaeologists and American Indians have met on a regular basis and developed both friendship and mutual respect.&lt;ref&gt;Versaggi (2006:30); Dean and Perrelli (2006:142-143)&lt;/ref&gt;  Versaggi found that “allowing the process to take time is what matters.”&lt;ref&gt;Versaggi (2006:30)&lt;/ref&gt;   Many community archaeologists now plan on conducting long-term collaborations from the outset of their project.&lt;ref&gt;Knecht (2003) Moser et al. (2002)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ethnography and getting to know the community===
As a method for knowing the community, archaeologists have advocated the use of [[ethnographic]] methods in community archaeology projects.&lt;ref name="Pyburn 2007"/&gt;  While most scholars feel that it is not necessary for all archaeologists to become trained ethnographers, a degree of ethnographic knowledge is needed before initiating a project.&lt;ref name="Pyburn 2007:177"/&gt;  Some community archaeology projects rely on ethnographic data conducted by members of their research team,&lt;ref&gt;Bartu as cited Atalay (2007:257)&lt;/ref&gt; while others have had some success beginning with published sources or collaborating with professionals already established in the focal community.

===Museums and institutions===
The construction of museums or other institutions as education centers,  repositories for archaeological materials and, centers for scientific and socio-cultural collaboration with a community is a common long-term goal for many community archaeology projects, and one achieved with increasing frequency.&lt;ref&gt;Moser (2002); Knecht (2003); Smith (2003); Jones and McBride (2006)&lt;/ref&gt;  Museums have become hubs for public outreach and collaboration to both local and non-local communities.&lt;ref&gt;Wille (2008)&lt;/ref&gt;  One well known example of a museum created by a collaboration between American Indians and archaeologists is the [[Mashantucket Pequot Museum and Research Center]], which is “the largest Native American owned museum in the United States”,&lt;ref&gt;Jones and McBride (2006:275)&lt;/ref&gt; has multiple laboratories and collections for scientific research, and a staff that includes five full-time archaeologists.&lt;ref name="Jones and McBride 2006"&gt;Jones and McBride (2006)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Publications for the community===
Another method in community archaeology for the sharing and distribution of archaeological knowledge is the publication or presentation of materials specifically for the community.  This includes books, pamphlets, children’s stories,&lt;ref name="Jones and McBride 2006"/&gt; school-oriented workbooks,&lt;ref&gt;Moser et al. (2002:238-239)&lt;/ref&gt; comic books,&lt;ref&gt;Atalay (2007:260-261)&lt;/ref&gt; websites,&lt;ref&gt;McDavid (2002, 2003)&lt;/ref&gt; public lectures, radio programs, television shows and news coverage, dramatic reenactments, artistic and literary creations, and other forms.

===Participatory action research===
[[Participatory action research]] is another method archaeologists have used in community archaeology projects.&lt;ref&gt;Strand et al. (2003); Hemment (2007); Pyburn (2007); Kuhns (2008)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Critiques==

===Who speaks for the community?===
In community archaeology, by definition decisions cannot be made based on the information from only a handful of members from a given community.  Although the number of consultants needed will vary, it is rare that a small subgroup can speak for the community as a whole.&lt;ref&gt;Rodriguez (2008); also see Pyburn (2007); Wobst (1978)&lt;/ref&gt;  Sometimes it is clear who should be contacted in a community.  For example, archaeologists in the United States must contact the Tribal Historic Preservation Officer (THPO) before attempting collaboration with federally recognized tribes.&lt;ref&gt;Dean and Perrelli (2006:142)&lt;/ref&gt;  In places where the appropriate contacts and stakeholders are less obvious, community archaeologists attempt to identify as many interest groups as possible and contact them before research begins.

===Top-down approach===
A [[top-down approach]] to community archaeology is when archaeologists decide before consultation what the goals of the project will be, or what benefits will be provided to the community is not really community archaeology at all.  The top-down approach creates a one-sided exchange of information from the archaeologists to the community and precludes real collaboration.  Blume found the “archaeologist-informant relationship [to be] essentially exploitative and patronizing because it takes place on the archaeologist’s terms—the informant must address issues that the archaeologists understand—and it excludes participation by [community members] who are unable or unwilling to participate on those terms.”&lt;ref&gt;Blume (2006:197)&lt;/ref&gt;  To succeed at community archaeology, Archaeologists have begun to undertake more reflexive collaborations with indigenous communities.&lt;ref&gt;Atalay (2006); Pyburn (2007); Pyburn (2008)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Carrying through with long-term commitments===
Some community archaeologists have had difficulty sticking to their original commitments to the community.&lt;ref&gt;Marshall (2002:218); Singleton (2003); Rodriguez (2006)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Consultation and collaboration===
Some have argued that ‘consulting’ archaeologists do not relinquish control over the process of interpretation, and that consulting is a ‘top-down’ approach to collaboration.&lt;ref&gt;Atalay (2006); Clarke (2002); Versaggi (2006);Watkins (2003); Blume (2006:210)&lt;/ref&gt;  Also, some definitions of the word ‘collaboration’ make allusions to opposed and/or warring parties cooperating with one another during tense or bellicose times.  Dean has proposed that the word cooperate be used instead.&lt;ref&gt;Dean and Perrelli (2006:145); also see Brown and Robinson (2006:62); Blume (2006:210)&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''crisis actor''' (aka '''actor-patient''' or '''actor victim''') is a trained [[actor]], role player, volunteer, or other person engaged to portray a disaster victim during [[safety drill|emergency drills]] to train first responders such as police, firefighters or EMT personnel. Crisis actors are used to create high-fidelity simulations of disasters in order to allow first responders to practice their skills and help emergency services organizations to prepare and train in realistic scenarios as part of full-scale disaster exercises.&lt;ref name="CrisisActors"&gt;{{cite web|title=Crisis Actors.

== Disaster training simulations ==
Actors take on the role of mock victims and simulate specific injuries from a disaster to add life-like realism to an emergency exercise. Theatrical [[makeup]] and cosmetics, plus rubber and latex appliances, are often used to simulate a variety of wounds or medical conditions that realistically portray victim's injuries, a practice known as [[Moulage|medical moulage]].&lt;ref name="Merica2011"&gt;{{cite book|author=Bobbie J Merica|title=Medical Moulage: How to Make Your Simulations Come Alive|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=hX_2AAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PR32|date=22 November 2011|publisher=F.A.

Actors who portray news reporters, relatives of victims, and concerned citizens are also used during drills to train [[emergency operations center]] personnel to cope with a variety of emotionally-charged demands and requests.&lt;ref name="Hiatt2000"&gt;{{cite book|author=Charlotte J. Hiatt|title=A Primer for Disaster Recovery Planning in an IT Environment|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=57bMejF-nk4C&amp;pg=PA228|date=1 January 2000|publisher=Idea Group Inc (IGI)|isbn=978-1-878289-81-0|pages=228–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Conspiracy theories and defamation ==
The term has been used by [[Conspiracy theory|conspiracy theorists]] who claimed that some [[mass shootings]] and other disasters were staged, and victims and their families were being played by crisis actors. Conspiracy theorists' use of the term is thought to have originated in 2012, when a blog post by former professor and professional conspiracy theorist [[James Tracy (communication scholar)|James Tracy]] suggested that the government could have hired an [[Talent agent|acting agency]] named [[Visionbox]], which supplied crisis actors who were "trained in criminal and victim behavior, and bring intense realism to simulated mass casualty incidents in public places" to help stage the [[Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting|Sandy Hook shooting]].

Tracy also promoted a crisis actor conspiracy theory of the [[Boston Marathon bombing]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://motherboard.vice.com/en_us/article/pammy8/what-is-a-crisis-actor-conspiracy-theory-explanation-parkland-shooting-sandy-hook|title=Where the 'Crisis Actor' Conspiracy Theory Comes From|last1=Koebler|first1=Jason|date=22 February 2018|work=Motherboard|accessdate=22 February 2018|agency=[[Vice Media]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Vox2"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2018/2/22/17036018/parkland-conspiracy-theories|title=The Parkland conspiracy theories, explained Crisis actors? The deep state?|last1=Yglesias|first1=Matthew|publisher=Vox|accessdate=22 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Conspiracy theorists have claimed such attacks are "[[false flag]] operations" staged by conspirators, usually government or corporate forces, in order to achieve some goal such as justifying increased [[government surveillance]], disarmament of the population, or military action against blamed nations or groups. Crisis actors are claimed in this context to play the part of bystanders or witnesses, emergency response personnel, and (with the aid of stage makeup) wounded victims of the attack.

Popularizers of the conspiracy theory include commentators such as [[Alex Jones]] and outlets such as ''True Pundit''.&lt;ref name="NYT2"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/06/29/us/after-orlando-shooting-false-flag-and-crisis-actor-conspiracy-theories-surface.html|title=After Orlando Shooting, 'False Flag' and 'Crisis Actor' Conspiracy Theories Surface|last1=Mele|first1=Christopher|newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |accessdate=28 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Guardian12"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/feb/21/crisis-actors-deep-state-false-flag-the-rise-of-conspiracy-theory-code-words |title=Crisis actors, deep state, false flag: the rise of conspiracy theory code words|last1=Wilson|first1=Jason|newspaper=The Guardian|accessdate=22 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Vox2" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Snopes12"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.snopes.com/same-girl-crying-now-oregon/|title=Crisis Actors Uncovered?|publisher=Snopes |accessdate=22 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In April 2018, the parents of two children killed in the Sandy Hook shooting launched a lawsuit against Alex Jones for defamation "accusing him and his website [[InfoWars]] of engaging in a campaign of 'false, cruel, and dangerous assertions'".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-texas-lawsuit-alexjones/sandy-hook-parents-sue-conspiracy-theorist-alex-jones-for-defamation-idUSKBN1HO2FU|title=Sandy Hook parents sue conspiracy theorist Alex Jones for defamation|author=Editorial |publisher=Reuters |access-date=2018-06-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Dextroscope''' is a [[Virtual Reality]] (VR) environment designed to provide medical professionals with deeper understanding of a patient's complex 3D anatomical relationships and pathology. Although its main intended purpose is to enable surgeons to plan a surgical procedure (in particular, neurosurgery&lt;ref name=":11"/&gt;), it has also proven useful in research in cardiology&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = http://jcmr-online.com/content/12/S1/O14|title = MRI and CT Tracking of Mesenchymal Stem Cells with Novel Perfluorinated Alginate Microcapsules|last = Fu|first = Yingli|date = 2010|journal = Journal of Cardiovascular Magnetic Resonance|doi = 10.1186/1532-429X-12-S1-O14|pmid = |access-date =|volume=12|pages=O14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Instead of immersing the whole user into a virtual reality, it just immersed the hands of the neurosurgeon into the patient data. The Dextroscope started as a research project in the mid-90s with the name The Virtual Workbench&lt;ref name=":16" /&gt;  and started commercialization in 2000 with the incorporation of the company [[Volume Interactions Pte Ltd]]. 

The Dextroscope allows its user to interact intuitively with a [[Virtual Patient]]. The Virtual Patient is composed of computer-generated 3D multi-modal images obtained from any [[DICOM]] tomographic data including [[Computer to|CT]], [[Magnetic resonance imaging|MRI]], [[Magnetic resonance angiography|MRA]], [[Magnetic resonance venography|MRV]], functional MRI and [[Computer Tomography angiography|CTA]], [[Positron emission tomography|PET]], [[Single Photon Emission Computed Tomography|SPECT]] and [[Tractography]]. It can work with any multi-modality combination, supporting polygonal meshes as well.

The user sits at the Dextroscope 3D interaction console and manipulates the Virtual Patient using both hands in a similar manner to how one would manipulate a real object. Using stereoscopic visualisations displayed via a mirror, the Dextroscope user sees the Virtual Patient floating behind the mirror but within easy reach of the hands and uses flexible 3D hand movements to rotate and manipulate the object of interest. The Dextroscope allows virtual segmentation of organs and structures, making accurate 3D measurements, etc.
[[File:Dextroscope MK10.jpg|thumb|The Dextroscope.]]
In one hand the user holds an ergonomically shaped handle with a switch that, when pressed, allows the 3D image to be moved freely as if it were an object held in real space. The other hand holds a pencil shaped stylus that is used to select tools from a virtual control panel and perform detailed manipulations and operations on the 3D image. The user does not see the stylus, handle or his/her hands directly, as they are hidden behind the surface of the mirror. Instead he/she sees a virtual handle and stylus calibrated to appear in exactly the same position as the real handle and stylus. The business end of the virtual handle can be selected to be anything that the software can create - drill tool, measurement tool, cutter, etc. Experience has shown that it is unnecessary to model the user's hands, provided that he/she can see and feel the real tools and that these perceptions match the virtual scene. This is highly advantageous since the hands would otherwise clutter the workspace and obscure the view of the object of interest.&lt;ref name=":16"&gt;Poston, T., Serra, L., 1996. ''Dextrous Virtual Work. Commun. ACM'' 39, 37–45. doi:10.1145/229459.229464
&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the uses of the Dextroscope is to allow surgeons to interact with and manipulate the Virtual Patient and plan the ideal surgical trajectory - for example, by simulating inter-operative viewpoints or the removal of bone and soft tissue. Apart from being much faster to work this way than using a mouse and keyboard, this approach also provides the medical professional, typically a surgeon, with a greater degree of control over the 3D image - with the hands literally being able to reach inside to manipulate the image interior.

== Manipulating the Virtual Patient – Virtual Reality Toolsets ==

The Dextroscope provides an extensive set of virtual tools that can be used to manipulate the 3D image. For example, there are dedicated tools to perform data segmentation to extract surgically relevant structures like the cortex or a tumor
,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Chia | first1 = W.K. | last2 = Serra | first2 = L. | year = 2006 | title = Contouring in 2D while viewing stereoscopic 3D volumes | url = | journal = Stud Health Technol Inform | volume = 119 | issue = | pages = 93–95 | pmid = 16404022 }}&lt;/ref&gt; extract blood vessels,&lt;ref&gt;Serra, L., Hern, N., Choon, C.B., Poston, T., 1997. Interactive vessel tracing in volume data, in: Proceedings of the 1997 Symposium on Interactive 3D Graphics, I3D ’97. ACM, New York, NY, USA, p. 131–ff. {{DOI|10.1145/253284.253320}}&lt;/ref&gt; adjust the color and transparency of displayed structures to see deep inside the patient and even simulate some surgical procedures – such as the removal of bone using a simulated skull drilling tool.

Typical structures that can be segmented are tumors, blood vessels, aneurysms, parts of the skull base, and organs. Segmentation is done either automatically (when the structures are demarcated clearly by their outstanding image intensity - such as the cortex) or through user interaction (using for example an outlining tool to define the extent of the structure manually). A virtual ‘pick’ tool allows the user to pick a segmented object and uncouple it from its surroundings for closer inspection. A measurement tool provides accurate measurement of straight and curving 3D structures such as the scalp, and measure angles, such as those between vessels or bony structures (for example, when planning the insertion of a screw into the spine).

== Dextroscope and Diagnostic Imaging ==

Dextroscope is not just for surgeons - radiologists can benefit from it too. The rapid growth in multi-modal diagnostic imaging data routinely available has increased their workload tremendously. Using the Dextroscope, radiologists can reconstruct multimodal models from high volumes of 2D slices – hence facilitating a better understanding of the 3D anatomical structures and helping with the diagnosis.

Furthermore, the Dextroscope virtual reality environment helps bridge the gap between radiology and surgery - by allowing the radiologist to easily demonstrate to surgeons important 3D structures in a way that surgeons are familiar with.&lt;br /&gt; This demonstration capability makes it also useful as a base for medical educators in which to convey 3D information to students.&lt;ref&gt;Haase, J., 2010.

'''[[Drohobych]] Petroleum and Gas College''' ([[Ukrainian language|Ukrainian]]:  ''[[:uk:Дрогобицький коледж нафти і газу]]'') is one of technical colleges in [[Drohobych]], [[Ukraine]]. It was first established as Drohobych Petroleum Technical College in 1945, transforming into ''Petroleum and Gas College'' in 2012. It is the [[alma mater]] of many [[Ukrainians|Ukrainian]] scientists, businessmen and politicians.

===Ukrainian SSR===

[[Drohobych]] Petroleum and Gas College was founded as [[Drohobych]] Petroleum Technical College on January 20, 1945 (Decree №58 of the [[Government of Ukraine|Ukrainian Government]]). Since its establishment the school trained over 20 thousand specialists in oil, gas and their refining industry.

The first graduation ceremony was held in 1948.

Given the increasing demand for industry specialists by [[Carpathian Mountains|Carpathian]] region companies, college opened a branch department in [[Boryslav]] in, 1953.  Evening courses were dedicated to specialists training in the fields of "Exploitation of oil and gas wells" and "The technology of oil and gas".

In 1957 Drohobych Petroleum Technical College was merged with [[Lviv]] College of Petroleum Refining.

In 1958 college established distance-learning department, conducting training of specialists in the fields of "Drilling oil and gas wells", "Exploitation of oil and gas wells", "Equipment of oil and gas industries" and "Chemical technology of oil and gas".

In 1959 a new branch (evening school) was opened in [[Dolyna]] with following desiplines offered: "Exploitation of oil and gas wells", "Equipment oil and gas industry" and "Oil and gas industry enterprises planning".

Due to the decrease in the number of applicants for evening departments, [[Boryslav]] and [[Dolyna]] branches ceased operations in 1973 and 1975 respectively.

===Post-Declaration===

In 1997 Petroleum Technical College received a license qualifying it for training junior specialists in the field of "Banking" and "Gas and oil exploitation and storage management".

Currently, the college prepares specialists in nearly all specialties related to oil and gas extraction and processing.

In December 2006, the [[Ministry of Education and Science of Ukraine]] (Decree №64) accredited Petroleum Technical College as a higher educational institution of the first level and issued its first certificate of accreditation (license serial no. AB482982) granting college the right to provide educational services related to obtaining higher education level qualification "junior specialist".

In August 2012 college was renamed to "State Higher Educational Institution "[[Drohobych]] Petroleum and Gas College" (Decree №870 of the [[Ministry of Education and Science of Ukraine|Ministry of Education of Ukraine]]).

==College today==

College training is based on primary and secondary education on a full-time, part-time and distance learning basis. Total student population: 1600. Annual college intake ranges from 330 to 400 students. 46 of 99 teaching staff are lecturers of the first category, 7 - teaching Methodists, 3 PhDs, 4 Candidates of Science.

The College operates in conjunction with the [[Ivano-Frankivsk]] [[Ivano-Frankivsk National Technical University of Oil and Gas|National Technical University of Oil and Gas]], [[Kiev]] [[Igor Sikorsky Kyiv Polytechnic Institute|Polytechnic Institute]] and [[Dnipro]] State Chemical Technology University. College is also represented as educational consulting office of [[Ivano-Frankivsk]] [[Ivano-Frankivsk National Technical University of Oil and Gas|National Technical University of Oil and Gas]] where alumni may continue their education at university of IV-th accreditation level.

The '''Expert Group Meeting (EGM): prevention of violence against women and girls''' was convened as part of the [[United Nations Commission on the Status of Women]]'s multi-year programme of work for 2010-2014. The "Elimination and prevention of all forms of violence against women and girls" forms a priority theme for its fifty-seventh session in 2013 (CSW57).

The meeting took place in [[Bangkok]], [[Thailand]] 17–20 September 2012 and was organised by the [[United Nations Entity for Gender Equality and the Empowerment of Women]] ([[UN Women]]), in collaboration with the following organisations:
*[[United Nations Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific]] (ESCAP);
*[[United Nations Development Programme]] ([[UNDP]]);
*[[United Nations Population Fund]] (UNFPA);
*[[United Nations Children’s Fund]] ([[UNICEF]]) and;
*[[World Health Organization]] ([[WHO]]).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.unwomen.org/en/events/59/expert-group-meeting-prevention-of-violence-against-women-and-girls/ EGM announced, [[UN Women]]'s website.]{{dead link|date=September 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} Retrieved 28 February 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
''EGM note 2''&lt;br /&gt; The report reflects the shared discussion and analysis of the major issues, gaps and challenges identified at the EGM and presents key findings and recommendations. It was intended to build on the individual papers on specific issues provided by experts prior to the meeting, and the background paper prepared by the rapporteur.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=17 Sep 2012 - 20 Sep 2012 09:00 AM to 6:00 PM |url=http://www.unwomen.org/events/59/expert-group-meeting-prevention-of |title=violence-against-women-and-girls/ Background papers are available on the EGM website |publisher=Unwomen.org |date= |accessdate=2013-06-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; It provides inputs for the reports of the Secretary-General to the CSW and widely disseminated in preparation to the [[United Nations Commission on the Status of Women#Session reports|fifty-seventh session of CSW (CSW57)]].

==Organisation of work==
''EGM notes 3 to 5''&lt;br /&gt;
The EGM brought together a diverse group of people from different backgrounds and regions including [[#Participants|academics, practitioners, representatives from women’s organisations and staff members of the United Nations system.]]

The experts elected a drafting committee (including two co-chairs) which was tasked to draft the report of the meeting, P miconclusions and recommendations. The following experts were elected to the drafting committee:
*[[Sunila Abeysekera]] (Co-Chair)
*Marai Larasi (Co-Chair)
*Fatuma Chegue
*Edwina Kotoisuva
*Tatiana Moura
*[[Hibaaq Osman]]
*Jeanne Ward
*Lara Fergus (Rapporteur)

==Introduction==
''EGM note 6''&lt;br /&gt; Experts noted that violence against women and girls is defined as ‘any act of gender-based violence that results in, or is likely to result in, physical, sexual or psychological harm or suffering to women [or girls], including threats of such acts, coercion or arbitrary deprivation of liberty, whether occurring in public or in private life.’{{ref|a}} It exists in multiple, interrelated and sometimes recurring forms, and is a manifestation of historically unequal power relations between men and women.{{ref|b}}

''EGM note 7''&lt;br /&gt; Experts stressed that we are at a critical moment where international bodies, nation states and civil society can and must come together to solidify commitments to ending violence against women and girls, as fragile and – in many places – deteriorating economic conditions, persistent environmental degradation, internal conflicts and wars, all contribute to the exacerbation of violence against women and girls, and violations of their rights.

''EGM note 8''&lt;br /&gt; Experts noted that the impacts of the global financial crisis, the economic pressures on Governments to reduce funding to social services and programmes, and the ongoing resource constraints faced by conflict-affected and developing countries, all risk limiting or reducing the investment States will make in preventing and responding to violence against women and girls.

''EGM note 9''&lt;br /&gt; However, they highlighted the enormous costs violence against women and girls entails to States and societies as a whole, in terms of reduced human capital, decreased productivity, exacerbated social inequalities, lowered overall educational outcomes, and broad strains on public services. Violence diminishes women’s and girls’ ability to gain an education, earn a living and participate in public life, and live a life free of fear. It has significant health impacts, including psychological consequences, physical injuries, sexual/reproductive health issues and death.{{ref|c}} In war-affected settings, violence against women and girls inhibits efforts towards peace-building and sustainable recovery, contributing to the risk of resurgent conflict. In development settings, it hinders progress towards achievement of several of the [[Millennium Development Goals|Millennium Development Goals (MDGs)]], including those relating to [[Millennium Development Goals#Goal 2: Achieve universal primary education|education]], [[Millennium Development Goals#Goal 6: Combat HIV/AIDS, malaria, and other diseases|HIV/AIDS]], [[Millennium Development Goals#Goal 5: Improve maternal health|maternal health]] and [[Millennium Development Goals#Goal 4: Reduce child mortality rates|child mortality]].{{ref|d}} It has intergenerational impacts, given that women use disproportionately more of their income toward supporting their families, and because violence diminishes their ability to fully participate in their societies (for example in politics, work or education) they are less able to invest in their children’s futures. One study in Chile found that women’s lost earnings alone as a result of domestic violence cost US$1.56 billion or more than 2 percent of the country’s Gross Domestic Product.{{ref|e}}

''EGM note 10''&lt;br /&gt; Violence against women and girls therefore entails massive costs to the State, and has a dragging effect on all other social and economic development efforts, particularly in humanitarian and development contexts. It is only by lowering the incidence of violence against women and girls, preventing recurrence, and responding effectively to existing violence to minimise ongoing impacts, that the overall costs of such violence to any economy will be reduced.{{ref|f}} Experts noted that, in the face of such evidence, prevention is not only possible, but central to the social and economic advancement of developed and developing countries alike. It was reiterated that all States have not only a responsibility to significantly strengthen their planning and budgeting efforts for prevention of violence against women and girls, but that doing so will contribute to positive social and economic outcomes.

''EGM note 11''&lt;br /&gt; Experts brought together experiences from across developing and developed countries, and from humanitarian contexts (arising from conflict and natural disasters), demonstrating that violence against women and girls could be prevented regardless of political, social and economic conditions. Levels of violence against women and girls vary across countries that with similar economic status or political systems – a variation that can be attributed to different laws, policies, practices, norms, behaviours and attitudes that contribute to, justify or excuse violence against women and girls. Such factors must be targeted to prevent and reduce violence within and across all settings.

''EGM note 12''&lt;br /&gt; Across developing and developed countries alike, more comprehensive, multi-sectoral and sustained approaches were recognised as necessary to achieve such change, with investments commensurate to the enormous scale of the abuse and its impacts. While the allocation of more resources to prevention remained high on the priority list for experts, political will was also identified as a key factor. It was noted that organisations and communities in some developing countries have led the way in testing and expanding new models for prevention, however experts did not believe any State was currently meeting its full normative obligations in this area.

''EGM note 13''&lt;br /&gt; Experts reiterated that violence against women and girls is a pervasive and systematic human rights violation, caused by – and reinforcing – gender inequality and entrenched discrimination. While most violence against women and girls is committed by non-State actors or individuals (usually men known to the victims/survivors, often husbands/intimate partners or other family members), experts were adamant that laws, policies and practices emanating from the State – as well as from traditional or customary practices – could also result in direct violence against women and girls, fail to respond to it, or create an environment where such violence was tolerated, excused or justified.

''EGM note 14''&lt;br /&gt; To this end, experts noted that the prevention of violence against women and girls could not be achieved without the full implementation of the existing legal obligation on States – under the ''[[Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women|Convention for the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women (CEDAW)]]'' to ‘take all appropriate measures to modify the social and cultural patterns of conduct of men and women, with a view to achieving the elimination of prejudices and customary and all other practices which are based on the idea of the inferiority or the superiority of either of the sexes or on stereotyped roles for men and women,’{{ref|g}} along with the more detailed obligations relating to the elimination of violence against women and girls outlined in the ''[[Fourth World Conference on Women#Beijing Platform for Action|Beijing Declaration and Platform for Action (BPfA)]]''.{{ref|h}}&lt;ref name="Source2"&gt;[https://www.un.org/womenwatch/daw/beijing/platform/ Beijing Platform for Action (BPfA), [[UN Women]]. Retrieved 28 February 2013.]&lt;/ref&gt; Experts emphasised, as central to the latter, the obligation on States to ‘refrain from invoking any custom, tradition or religious consideration to avoid their obligations’{{ref|i}} to eliminate violence against women and girls.

''EGM note 15''&lt;br /&gt; A key message from experts was that the call for greater efforts to prevent violence against women and girls is not a ‘new demand,’ but well supported by international legal and normative frameworks. What is new is the emergence, in recent years, of an unprecedented evidence and practice base that provides concrete guidance on the application of proven and effective strategies, and makes prevention of violence against women and girls a tangible and measurable goal. We now know that to effectively prevent violence against women and girls, efforts must go beyond simple awareness-raising projects and instead work to actively (and measurably) transform discriminatory and violence-supportive attitudes and behaviours, community norms, institutional practices and systems, laws and policies, and society as a whole.

''EGM note 16''&lt;br /&gt; Experts noted that this holistic and comprehensive approach to prevention has the potential to create numerous benefits for communities beyond reductions in violence, because it also addresses the discrimination, inequality and other violence-supportive practices and behaviours that contribute to a range of social ills. Prevention of violence against women and girls is ultimately about building relationships, communities and organisations that are equal, non-violent and respectful of all individuals. It results in the creation of more peaceful, egalitarian and productive societies where women and girls live free from the discrimination, harassment, violence and fear of violence that can block them from reaching their full human potential.

===Defining prevention===
''EGM note 17''&lt;br /&gt; The focus of the meeting (and this report) was on prevention of violence against women and girls ''before it occurs'', that is, by identifying and addressing its underlying causes and promoting shifts in the social environment that ultimately reduce the number of new incidents of violence against women and girls.

''EGM note 18''&lt;br /&gt; Experts noted that prevention of violence against women and girls remains a poorly understood concept across sectors and stakeholders. Prevention is often conflated with early intervention or the response to existing violence, or else limited to awareness raising or social marketing campaigns. Simplistic analyses and programmes aimed at single-cause factors such as alcohol abuse, or placing the responsibility to prevent violence on women and girls themselves (such as self-defence programmes) can in some cases do more harm than good, and are not uncommon. Cynical perceptions that violence against women and girls is somehow an inevitable part of society, and that efforts to prevent it are well-intentioned but ultimately ineffective, are also widespread. There is therefore a need to build not only evidence, but shared understandings of the complexity and causes of violence against women and girls, and of how it can be effectively prevented.

''EGM note 19''&lt;br /&gt; Experts recognised that this transformative agenda engages all levels of the socio-political system, from policy and legislative development, to the development and delivery of programmes and services ‘on the ground’, and the capacity building of the institutions responsible for implementation. Confronting existing social and gendered realities that continue to use arguments based on culture, customs and ‘traditional’ values and practices to justify discrimination and violence against women and girls, and treat them as subordinate and second-class citizens, remains a major challenge in addressing the social and cultural environments that permit violence against women and girls to flourish with impunity. As the Special Rapporteur on violence against women, its causes and consequences has noted: ‘no form of interpersonal violence against women is devoid of structural violence – as in all places, such abuse is underpinned by beliefs about the perpetrator’s right to harm another, based on societal notions of gender and rights.’{{ref|j}}

''EGM note 20''&lt;br /&gt; Experts were particularly keen to convey that, in prevention terms, violence against women and girls in the private sphere and/or perpetrated by non-State actors could ''not'' be considered as something ‘separate’ from the actions of the State. Experts stressed that violence against women and girls – in every context – can be perpetuated by State decision-making mechanisms, laws, policies and practices when these systematically marginalize women and girls and/or fail to promote their rights. These include not only legal policies and programs that fail to criminalize violence against women and girls or adequately punish it, but also State-sanctioned discrimination, for example: excluding women from political participation (such as assemblies, high-level government positions, and key decision-making bodies like constitutional committees); constitutional language that threatens women’s rights (whether existing or developing in emerging State structures); or discriminatory laws, policies and budgets which disproportionately limit women’s and girls’ rights, neglect their voices and concerns, and fail to promote full substantive, as well as formal, equality between men and women.

''EGM note 21''&lt;br /&gt; State-sanctioned violence and discrimination against women is significantly tied to cultural and social norms that pervade a nation, which are then used to justify, excuse or tolerate violence against women and girls. When laws and policies limit women’s freedoms or deem women as ‘complementary’ instead of ‘equal to’ men, this trickles down to public perception of women and girls and their role in society, and undermines their safety and security within the State. These social and cultural norms are similarly impacted by the respect, or otherwise, of women’s civil and political rights (such as their political participation), and their economic, social and cultural rights (such as their access to work and education). Greater levels of social and economic equality between men and women, for instance, are closely correlated with lower levels of violence against women and girls at the population level. Similarly, greater visibility of women in leadership roles, including in constitution committees, assemblies and high-level posts in government, in peacekeeping troops and in peace-building talks, promotes positive and egalitarian norms and combats gender stereotypes in a way that counters discriminatory and violence-supportive attitudes and the marginalization of women and girls.

''EGM note 22''&lt;br /&gt; Prevention of violence against women and girls is often conceptualised in terms of awareness raising or community mobilisation, and these are important components. Experts reiterated the importance of grassroots community mobilisation in driving attitudinal and behavioural transformation at the local level. However, in light of the above, experts stressed the more expansive and multi-level nature of effective prevention, in particular the critical role of government to create an ‘enabling environment’ through undertaking policy, legislative and budgetary reform to promote gender equality and women’s empowerment, and actively address the multiple and intersecting forms of discrimination and disadvantage that place women and girls at risk of violence. They emphasised the additional role of States in providing support to women’s and other civil society actors, including women, men and youth community and religious leaders and opinion-makers, in their prevention efforts.

''EGM note 23''&lt;br /&gt; Experts further stressed the importance of continued investment in an effective ''response'' to existing violence against women and girls – including through improving legislative, police, justice and service systems{{ref|k}} – as a fundamental ‘building block’ for prevention, establishing accountability and redress, and protecting women and girls from further violence. Effective response systems are also necessary to ensure support of women and girls who may identify violence in their own lives as a direct result of prevention activity and seek help and redress. Experts acknowledged that a separate stream of work on building an effective multi-sectoral response was being undertaken in preparation for CSW.

''EGM note 24''&lt;br /&gt; Experts recommended that prevention and response strategies be developed and implemented as a holistic and integrated system that upholds the human rights of girls and women to live in societies, communities and families that are free of such violence. However, while essential, experts noted the evidence that an effective response has, in itself, only a limited impact on reducing the number of new incidents of violence. Specific actions to address the foundations of violence – discriminatory and violence-supportive practices, laws, norms, behaviours and attitudes – are also necessary in order to prevent violence against women and girls from happening in the first place, within and across all settings. These are the focus of discussions and recommendations in this Report.

===Describing the context===
''EGM note 25''&lt;br /&gt; The emphasis on economic growth in the development agenda globally has led to growing inequalities and a reduced focus on redistribution. The rolling economic crises currently gripping almost all of the world’s countries has resulted in increased unemployment and poverty, a shortage of housing, and cutbacks in social spending including subsidies for health and education. These multiple crises have in turn fuelled communal and ethnic tensions, mass migration and displacement, rendering millions homeless and poor, and more vulnerable to trafficking and diverse forms of exploitation. In most communities, this also results in the heightened vulnerability of women and girls to violence and exploitation.

''EGM note 26''&lt;br /&gt; Experts noted the evidence that violence against women and girls is intensified and exacerbated in situations of socio-economic stress, conflict and other crisis situations. In addition to the impact of economic crises described above, global warming and associated rising sea levels and severe weather events, as well as environmental degradation and resource depletion, can all contribute to conditions of social and economic vulnerability, including homelessness and mass migrations. They can also lead to the disaster or crisis situations in which violence against women and girls is known to increase.

''EGM note 27''&lt;br /&gt; As discrimination based on sex and gender continues to dominate social formations even in the 21st century, experts noted that violence against women and girls continues to be perceived as ‘normal’ in many contexts. The pervasive nature of militarization and the growth of all forms of religious fundamentalisms and other forms of extreme nationalism creates cultures where women are reduced to being symbolic ‘bearers’ of their culture and have their mobility and autonomy restricted in many different ways.

''EGM note 28''&lt;br /&gt; Exacerbated by the conditions described above (and even without them) women and girls experience daily harassment, abuse, discrimination and violence across the numerous settings in which they conduct their lives, from workplaces, schools and other educational institutions, community and faith organisations and groups, market places, shops, on public transport, in social settings, online and via social media, during flight and while displaced as a result of conflict and natural disasters, and above all in their homes.

''EGM note 29''&lt;br /&gt; Experts also identified emerging contexts and issues that have an impact on violence against women and girls. For example, experts agreed that the role of new media presents a number of layered and complex challenges, as well as opportunities, for the prevention of violence against women and girls. In the first instance, new media is often a platform for the perpetuation of harmful masculinities and the objectification of women and girls. This can take a number of forms from everyday hyper-sexualised, one-dimensional images of women and girls to hard-core pornography which has moved from the peripheries to the mainstream of the pornography industry. Virtual spaces are also utilised to perpetuate direct attacks on women and girls. This can range from cyber-stalking to the posting of inappropriate images / videos of women. For example, women have increasingly reported incidents of footage of them engaged in sexual activity (filmed both with and without consent) being posted on internet sites without their consent. In a number of cases this has included the posting of footage of actual rapes.{{ref|l}}

''EGM note 30''&lt;br /&gt; Violence in the virtual space and the wider issues of how women and girls are objectified in the media has particular implications for girls and younger women, who are much more like to engage with social networking sites, instant messaging, etc. Despite the range of violations, incidents can be hard to prosecute, especially as the internet is not limited to nation spaces. There are also real challenges around balancing the right to freedom of expression with the right to be protected from discrimination.{{ref|m}}

Their One Man Can campaign tackles [[HIV]] and [[gender-based violence]].]]
''EGM note 31''&lt;br /&gt; Experts also noted with concern the emerging evidence that adolescent girls and young women may also be targeted for sexual violence in the context of serious youth violence (e.g. youth gangs) and/or broader urban violence. They may also be members of gangs themselves and involved in perpetration of violence against other young women and girls within or between gangs. Experts further expressed the concern that adolescent girls and young women were frequently overlooked in policy and programming responses designed for young men, adult women or for children in general, yet the context of their lives may be quite distinct and require specific approaches, particularly given they are the age group at greatest risk of sexual violence.{{ref|n}}

''EGM note 32''&lt;br /&gt; In humanitarian crises caused by conflict and/or natural disasters, women and girls are at risk of violence throughout all stages: during crises, during flight from crises, while living in displaced settings, and during and following return. In situations of armed conflict, women and girls can be exposed to violence at the hands of armed actors, including soldiers and military assigned to protect civilians and assist in their safe flight from conflict. They may be recruited into armed groups and serve as sexual slaves to combatants. In some settings women and girls continue to be used as ‘weapons of war,’ subject to sexual assault by all parties to conflict, at times in front of their husbands, children, and other family or community members.

''EGM note 33''&lt;br /&gt; While much attention has been accorded to sexual violence against women and girls during conflict, they suffer many additional forms of violence in humanitarian emergencies, including sexual exploitation, trafficking, early marriage, and [[intimate partner violence]].{{ref|o}} Experts noted that all of these forms of violence can be averted or reduced with effective prevention programming from the contingency planning phase through to recovery, and States’ responsibilities to work towards the prevention of this violence are reinforced by a broad normative framework mandating protection of women and girls from sexual and other forms of violence in emergencies. And yet, prevention programming remains weak in virtually every humanitarian setting around the world.

''EGM note 34''&lt;br /&gt; Experts further noted the evidence that while more than 740,000 men, women, and children die each year as a result of armed violence, the majority of these deaths – 490,000 – occur in countries that are not affected by conflict.{{ref|p}} The proliferation of small arms increases the vulnerability of women and girls to violence, and exacerbates the seriousness of that violence. This is particularly true in the context of urban/serious youth (e.g. gang) violence (referred to above), but also in the case of violence in the home, where the presence of small arms significantly increases the risk of the victim being killed.{{ref|q}} The violent deaths of approximately 66,000 women and girls are attributed to armed violence globally each year.{{ref|r}}

''EGM note 35''&lt;br /&gt; Experts were finally keen to emphasise that – even within the same geographic or socio-political setting, ‘context’ was not the same thing for different women and girls. Women and girls often experience multiple and intersecting forms of social disadvantage and discrimination (in addition to that based on gender), and this compounds their individual and collective vulnerability to violence. The Special Rapporteur on violence against women, its causes and consequences, has recently noted that theories on violence have often ‘failed to provide a comprehensive understanding of how various forms of discrimination, beyond a male/female gender binary, contextualize, exacerbate, and correlate to high levels of violence in given societies. The lack of an intersectional approach can lead to the reinforcing of one form of discrimination in attempts to alleviate another.’{{ref|s}} Factors such as race, ethnicity, caste, class, age, religion, sexual orientation, marital status, geographic location, disability, HIV status or status as a refugee or internally displaced person, will all influence the forms and nature of violence women and girls may suffer, and the relationship of these factors to prevention is discussed in the ‘Key Findings’ section.

==Global policy and legislative / normative framework (abridged)==
''EGM note 36''&lt;br /&gt; The international community is committed to eliminating violence against women and girls{{ref|t}} and has recognised – in various global and regional legal and policy instruments – the important role of prevention towards this end.

''EGM note 37''&lt;br /&gt; Above all, State responsibility for prevention of violence against women and girls through social and behavioural change is supported by the foundational treaty on women’s human rights, the ''Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women'' (CEDAW), which establishes signatories’ legal obligation to take ‘all appropriate measures [to] modify the social and cultural patterns of conduct of men and women, with a view to achieving the elimination of prejudices and customary and all other practices which are based on the idea of the inferiority or the superiority of either of the sexes or on stereotyped roles for men and women.’{{ref|u}}  General Recommendation 19 of the CEDAW Committee defines violence as a form of discrimination against women, and establishes the obligation of States to act with ‘due diligence’ to prevent and respond to violence against women and girls.

''EGM note 38''&lt;br /&gt; The ''Declaration on the Elimination of Violence against Women'' enhanced the definition of violence against women and also included protection of women from violence committed in the private domain as being an obligation of the state.{{ref|v}} Responsibilities of the State to prevent violence, abuse and neglect of girls are further supported by the ''Convention on the Rights of the Child'', requiring States parties to ‘take all appropriate legislative, administrative, social and educational measures to protect the child from all forms of physical or mental violence, injury or abuse, neglect or negligent treatment, maltreatment or exploitation, including sexual abuse’ including ‘forms of prevention,’{{ref|w}} along with its two Optional Protocols.{{ref|x}}

''EGM note 39''&lt;br /&gt; The ''Beijing Declaration and Platform for Action'' (BPfA), adopted at the Fourth World Conference on Women in 1995, recognised the complexity of the underlying causes of violence against women and girls, and the need to link prevention and response activities. Paragraph 118 notes that:&lt;br /&gt;
:''violence against women throughout the life cycle derives essentially from cultural patterns, in particular the harmful effects of certain traditional or customary practices and all acts of extremism linked to race, sex, language or religion that perpetuate the lower status accorded to women in the family, the workplace, the community and society. Violence against women is exacerbated by social pressures, notably the shame of denouncing certain acts that have been perpetrated against women; women's lack of access to legal information, aid or protection; the lack of laws that effectively prohibit violence against women; failure to reform existing laws; inadequate efforts on the part of public authorities to promote awareness of and enforce existing laws; and the absence of educational and other means to address the causes and consequences of violence. Images in the media of violence against women, in particular those that depict rape or sexual slavery as well as the use of women and girls as sex objects, including pornography, are factors contributing to the continued prevalence of such violence, adversely influencing the community at large, in particular children and young people.''{{ref|y}}

''EGM notes 40 to 51''&lt;br /&gt; Other global policy and legislative / normative frameworks that are currently in place.

''EGM note 52''&lt;br /&gt; In conclusion, while the normative framework has clearly developed an obligation for States to take holistic, comprehensive, strategic and well-resourced action to prevent violence against women and girls, and while States have increasingly ratified the relevant treaties and in some cases brought these obligations into their legal frameworks, much work remains to be done before the normative obligations will be fully implemented. Gaps remain in terms of resource allocation, legislative and policy development, and systems and mechanisms for coordinated and sustained action.

''EGM note 53''&lt;br /&gt; In considering the above analysis, experts believed that a significant global shift in perceptions was necessary towards greater recognition of the widespread and systematic nature of violence against women and girls, deserving of more serious attention by States and the international community. Experts returned to and supported the international definition of violence against women and girls in the ''Declaration'', i.e. as a violation of human rights and a form of discrimination against them, that shall mean all acts of gender-based violence that result in, or are likely to result in, physical, sexual, psychological or economic harm or suffering to women and girls, including threats of such acts, coercion or arbitrary deprivation of liberty, whether occurring in public or in private life.{{ref|z}}

''EGM note 54''&lt;br /&gt; However, some experts noted that such violence is not isolated or sporadic, but could be seen as part of a widespread or systematic practice intended to humiliate or degrade an identifiable group. As such, they called for violence against women and girls to be considered a crime against humanity. Others cautioned against linking violence against women and girls to current definitions of crimes against humanity, given the existing limitations of international law and jurisprudence. It was noted that the landmark February 2008 judgement of the Sierra Leone Appeals Chamber of the Special Court in the Armed Forces Revolutionary Council case had set an historic precedent in recognising forced marriage as a distinct category of crimes against humanity in international criminal law.{{ref|A}} Experts therefore agreed that calling for violence against women and girls to be recognised as a crime against humanity was intended as an aspirational statement and advocacy goal, one which would expand current definitions and understanding of crimes against humanity – in a way similar to the Sierra Leone case – and help drive a global shift in perceptions towards one that recognises the full seriousness of violence against women and girls, and the urgency with which we must prevent it.

==Key findings (abridged)==
''EGM note 55''&lt;br /&gt; Based on comprehensive discussion at the EGM, review of the papers presented by experts, and an analysis of the global context, normative framework and evidence and practice base, experts agreed on the following key findings. Experts noted the significant development, over recent years, of guidance to States and other stakeholders in the development, implementation and monitoring of policy and programming to prevent violence against women and girls,{{ref|B}} and again
referred to the papers submitted to the EGM as providing further information on current practice. Rather than reiterate that guidance here, experts have confined their findings below to the emerging issues, and those perceived to be of most critical relevance to CSW.

''EGM note 56''&lt;br /&gt; Experts wished to reiterate, as a finding and central tenet of their recommendations, that prevention of violence against women and girls is a positive endeavour, a precondition for enabling women and men to reach their full potential, and is essential to the creation of healthy, equitable, stable and productive communities, workplaces, schools and universities, faith and cultural institutions, sporting and recreation organisations, and societies as a whole.

''EGM note 57''&lt;br /&gt; Noting recent research highlighting the unique and catalysing impact of women’s organisations on enduring and effective policy development to end violence against women and girls,{{ref|C}} experts were unanimous that effective prevention of violence against women and girls was not only often driven by, but ''required'' the involvement of women’s organisations, working in partnership with national, provincial and local Governments, communities, civil society groups, donors, the private sector and other non-state actors.

''EGM note 58''&lt;br /&gt; Experts emphasized the importance of moving away from short-term, ad hoc sensitisation and awareness raising activities and towards more comprehensive, longer-term prevention efforts that are grounded in communities and work systematically to change unequal power relations between women and men. Such social norm change requires working with a cross section of the community from women and men, young people, religious and cultural leaders, health care providers, police, government officials, the media and others, over time and in varied ways, to challenge norms that perpetuate violence and emphasize the positive benefits of non-violence, justice and equality for individuals, families and the broader community. Civil society plays an essential role in mobilising communities to rethink the acceptability of violence and supporting positive change.

''EGM note 59''&lt;br /&gt; However, while women’s and other civil society organisations and communities themselves have been at the forefront of developing the practice and evidence base for prevention programming, factors such as time, reach and workforce constraints can prevent many good initiatives from being evaluated, expanded or otherwise scaled-up. Research has also shown that those working to end violence against women and girls can themselves face discrimination, hostility, repudiation and even violence, precisely because they challenge traditional notions of the family and gender that contribute to such violence.{{ref|D}}

''EGM note 60''&lt;br /&gt;
To maximise the impact and sustainability of such work, therefore, Governments have a key role to play in supporting and creating an enabling environment for women’s organisations and others working to prevent violence against women and girls to continue to drive and innovate prevention programming, safe from violence and discrimination themselves. Governments should also activate their reach and mandate to ensure the scale-up, systematisation and embedding of good practice in laws, policies and through public institutions (e.g. schools, social and health services, media and workplace regulation) for long-term sustainability.

''EGM note 61''&lt;br /&gt; Experts noted that without States taking their full responsibility for sustained, systematic and coordinated policy, programming and investment for prevention, the transformative social development necessary to end violence against women and girls cannot be achieved. Few States worldwide had implemented their obligations to this end. A 2011 review of National Action Plans on Violence against Women found that most policies were limited to responding to existing violence. Those that did contain specific prevention actions largely focussed on raising awareness of new laws or where to access services, with some containing one-off or single-sector prevention activities such as social marketing campaigns or schools-based programmes. Only one identified plan took a long-term, multi-sectoral and holistic approach to prevention, with appropriate institutional support mechanisms and commensurate investment.{{ref|E}}

''EGM note 62''&lt;br /&gt; Importantly, one-off, single-sector or small-scale interventions, while they may have some effectiveness for participating individuals, are unable to change the social norms at the community or society level that have a dampening effect on such attitudinal change. Therefore, they can never in themselves decrease prevalence of violence against women and girls across society as a whole. Broad and sustainable change is only achieved when such activities are implemented in a long-term and cumulative way, mutually reinforced across various settings. These should be linked to a prevention framework which is coordinated to ensure that all levels are appropriately engaged, with evaluation and monitoring for continuous improvement. It is particularly essential that all strategies and interventions are supported by policy and legislative reform that promotes gender equality, challenges discrimination, and provides an effective response to existing violence.

''EGM notes 63 to 102''&lt;br /&gt; Other key findings from the EGM.

==Report recommendations==
''Recommendation 103''&lt;br /&gt;
Experts stressed the critical importance of women’s organisations, civil society, international institutions, donors and States working together to go beyond ‘ad hoc’ approaches to prevention, and for States to take their responsibility for developing long-term and multi-sectoral strategies so that activity can be coordinated, and evidence built, to achieve real results. With an increased commitment from all actors to such an approach, and corresponding investment, many experts believed violence against women and girls could be ended within a generation. To this end, experts have made recommendations (see below) for a coordinated and target-focussed approach to preventing violence against women and girls, driven by two overarching activities – a [[Global Implementation Plan to End Violence against Women and Girls|Global Implementation Plan]] – framing the work of international, regional and national institutions (including States) toward the goal of ending violence against women and girls, along with a  [[Global Advocacy Campaign to Prevent Violence against Women and Girls|Global Advocacy Campaign]] – driven by women’s and other civil society organisations to create momentum and provide accountability for the above.

''Recommendation 104''&lt;br /&gt; Also, given CSW’s specific mandate with regards to implementation of the ''Beijing Declaration and Platform for Action''{{ref|F}} experts have made further recommendations for immediate implementation, aligned with the BPfA’s strategic objectives of taking integrated measures to prevent and eliminate violence against women, and studying the causes and consequences of violence against women and the effectiveness of preventive measures. While the BPfA objectives cover both prevention of, and response to, violence against women and girls, and experts supported full implementation of all of these, the recommendations below build on those areas focussing on prevention.

''Recommendation 105''&lt;br /&gt; Finally, experts identified recommendations arising from emerging issues or gaps in the evidence and practice base regarding prevention of violence against women and girls in certain contexts and settings. These include recommendations for prevention in settings affected by humanitarian crises such as conflict and natural disasters; contexts of serious urban or youth violence; with regards to representation of women and girls in the context of mass media as well as in new social media; and in the context of the global financial crisis and shifting geopolitics. In addition to the broad recommendations below that are relevant to all settings, special attention has been given to certain contexts and settings in order to highlight specific strategies for prevention related to these particular areas of concern. Experts have also chosen to highlight certain recommendations specific to preventing violence against girls, including adolescent girls, and young women, as a frequently overlooked group worthy of special consideration.

=== A global implementation plan to end violence against women and girls ===
[[File:Earth-illustration-blue.jpg|thumb|''[[Global Implementation Plan to End Violence against Women and Girls|A global implementation plan to end violence against women and girls.]]''(Recommendations 106 -112)]]
''Recommendation 106''&lt;br /&gt;
Experts agreed that while an international legal and normative frame work for preventing violence against women and girls is already in place, there are two major barriers to its implementation. The first is that social and cultural norms and customs are often used as a shroud or excuse for laws, practices and behaviours that are either directly violent and discriminatory towards women and girls, or else contribute to and support violence against them. '''The BPfA clearly calls on States to ‘refrain from invoking any custom, tradition or religious consideration to avoid their obligations with respect to its elimination as set out in the Declaration on the Elimination of Violence against Women,’'''{{ref|G}} and experts were adamant that this entails an active obligation on States to examine their own laws and policies, and challenge the communities, organisations and individuals in their jurisdictions, to eliminate norms and customs that excuse, justify or tolerate violence against women and girls, and which exist in all societies.

''Recommendation 107''&lt;br /&gt;
A second barrier to full implementation of existing obligations is the lack of a coordinated, strategic agenda at international, regional and national levels for '''modifying ‘the social and cultural patterns of conduct of men and women, with a view to achieving the elimination of prejudices and customary and all other practices which are based on the idea of the inferiority or the superiority of either of the sexes or on stereotyped roles for men and women,’'''{{ref|H}} '''required by [[CEDAW]].''' This is an essential precondition and support for the sustainable prevention of violence against women and girls. As noted above, such prejudices, practices and stereotypes are rampant in all societies, expressed as much through channels such as media and popular culture, as through institutions more identifiable as the bearers of custom or ‘tradition’ (e.g. faith institutions). A much greater commitment and level of resourcing is required from all States, along with significantly improved coordination of policy, programming and research at global, regional and national levels towards a shared strategic agenda to eliminate these and so meet the legal obligation under CEDAW.

''Recommendation 108''&lt;br /&gt;
To this end, an overarching recommendation from experts was that Member States commit, at CSW in 2013, to develop a [[Global Implementation Plan to End Violence against Women and Girls]], to be launched in 2015, with a particular focus on prevention of violence against women and girls. This Plan should aim to provide vigilance on established international obligations (particularly the overarching BPfA&lt;ref name="Source2"/&gt; and [[CEDAW]] obligations cited above), and serve as the tool for operationalising these norms into national policy and programming in a coordinated and results-based way.

''Recommendation 109''&lt;br /&gt;
The [[Global Implementation Plan to End Violence against Women and Girls]], endorsed and supported by Member States at its launch, would aim to:
&lt;ol type="a"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Intensify and scale-up global awareness of violence against women and girls as a global emergency&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Combine the best thinking on how to proceed with concrete pledges for action.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Mobilise international, regional and national action by governments, multilaterals, the private sector and civil society.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Build the foundation for an evidence and practice-informed global prevention strategy.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Increase resources available to end violence against women and girls.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

''Recommendation 110''&lt;br /&gt;
Development of the plan should be linked to the processes defining the post-2015 development agenda, to ensure that the prevention of violence against women and girls is rightly understood as crucial to the meeting of other internationally agreed development goals, and that targets relating to the prevention of (and response to) such violence are explicitly identified and well situated in the post-2015 development framework.

''Recommendation 111''&lt;br /&gt;
Development of the plan would require, among other things:
&lt;ol type="a"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Identification of a small set of key policy, legal and programme-delivery targets (institutions) at the national level towards which global violence prevention efforts can be directed.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Detailed review of existing action plans, indicators, recommendations, platforms for action, policy agendas, and recommendations outlined by the Security Council, UN Treaty bodies, the special rapporteurs, and various UN agencies, with a view to closing implementation gaps and building the next stage. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Creation of a cohesive global community of key stakeholders.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Designation of strong coordinating mechanisms.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Development of an accountability framework with indicators to measure State responsiveness to the policy, legal and programme-delivery goals identified and an independent monitoring mechanism.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

''Recommendation 112''&lt;br /&gt;
Development of the plan should include the proactive engagement of new partners (such as the private sector, sporting organisations, religious and cultural leaders, the media and entertainment industry), with a critical eye to the internal structures and methods of operation of such partners to ensure they fully support and in no way undermine the human rights of women and girls.

===A global advocacy campaign for prevention===
&lt;!-- [[File:Civilizations map 2.png|thumb|''[[A Global Advocacy Campaign for Prevention.|A global advocacy campaign for prevention]]'' (Recommendations 113 to 114)]] --&gt;
''Recommendation 113''&lt;br /&gt;
Experts further recognised the crucial and catalytic role of women’s organisations and called for them to help build support and momentum for the above. A global ‘movement for prevention’ is needed, engaging a critical mass of individuals, groups and institutions working together to create communities and countries that are safe for women and girls and where their rights are respected.

''Recommendation 114''&lt;br /&gt;
Experts’ second overarching recommendation was therefore that women’s organisations, in partnership with other civil society organisations and identified willing international and regional institutions, States and other relevant parties, lead a [[Global Advocacy Campaign to Prevent Violence against Women and Girls]], as a crucial accompaniment to the development of the [[Global Implementation Plan to End Violence against Women and Girls|Implementation Plan]] above. [[Global Advocacy Campaign to Prevent Violence against Women and Girls|The Advocacy Campaign]] could include the creation of plain language communications materials, mechanisms to share information and practice, avenues for capacity development, and advocacy strengthening, for example through the training of male and female youth and veteran activists and leaders to monitor progress of nations on international agreements, produce reports, and represent women’s and girls’ priorities and interests in international fora. The aim of [[Global Advocacy Campaign to Prevent Violence against Women and Girls|the Advocacy Campaign]] would be to create momentum for the [[Global Implementation Plan to End Violence against Women and Girls|Implementation Plan]], ensure the consistent promotion of evidence-informed, rights-based prevention activity, and hold international, regional and national stakeholders accountable to women and girls.

===Integrated measures to prevent and eliminate violence against women and girls===
[[File:No-slavery.jpg|thumb|''Integrated measures to prevent and eliminate violence against women and girls.'' (Recommendations 115 to 125)]]
''Recommendation 115''&lt;br /&gt;''
While the [[Global Implementation Plan to End Violence against Women and Girls|Global Implementation Plan]] may take one to two years to develop, there are many areas of work that States have already committed to under the BPfA&lt;ref name="Source2"/&gt; Strategic Objective D1 – to take integrated measures to prevent and eliminate violence against women – and upon which they can and should take immediate action. Below are recommendations elaborated by the experts in line with the growing evidence and practice base on prevention, in support of these existing commitments.

''Recommendation 116''&lt;br /&gt;''
'''In line with BPfA’s'''&lt;ref name="Source2"/&gt; '''Paragraph 124(j), calling on Governments to ‘formulate and implement, at all appropriate levels, plans of action to eliminate violence against women,’and Paragraph 124(p)calling for the allocation of ‘adequate resources within the government budget and mobilis[ation of]community resources for activities related to the elimination of violence against women, including resources for the implementation of plans of action at all appropriate levels,’''' experts recommend that States work in partnership with funders, international and regional institutions, women’s and civil society organisations and other stakeholders to develop, implement,
evaluate and monitor coordinated, multisectoral and sustained prevention strategies, alongside and reinforcing strategies to improve the response to existing violence. Such strategies should
&lt;ol type="a"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;address the underlying causes of violence against women and girls in norms and practices at socio-structural, community, organisational, relationship and individual levels, and include a performance monitoring framework, and coordination and accountability mechanisms.&lt;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;comprise a variety of coordinated interventions to be implemented in a mutually reinforcing way across settings and sectors.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;include the review and revision of policy and legislation to ensure a consistent whole-of-government framework for the prevention of violence against women and girls that promotes women’s and girls’ human rights and gender equality in line with international norms. This review and reform process should ensure law and policy: aligns with and responds explicitly to State obligations under relevant human rights treaties, intergovernmental agreements and international standards/guidelines, repealing and reforming discriminatory laws and criminalizing violence against women and girls; defines violence against women and girls according to international norms, acknowledging that such violence is a form of discrimination and manifestation of historically unequal power relations between men and women, and the recognising the particular vulnerabilities of girls; and recognises that women’s and girls’ experience of violence is shaped by factors such as disability, age, ethnicity, religion, political or other opinion, national or social origin, property, marital status, sexual orientation, HIV/AIDS status, migrant or refugee status and exposure to conflict or natural disaster.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;be supported by multi-sectoral coordination mechanisms, with the involvement of representatives from across government institutions and also civil society, donors and other stakeholders who can aid in implementation. These mechanisms should begin by identifying where existing capacity could be harnessed in particular programmatic areas for immediate impact (e.g. through existing health or education sectors, or existing nongovernment programming), and provide for the development of capacity (e.g. a human rights training curriculum and mandatory training for all elected officials and civil servants at every level of government) across other sectors for mid to longer-term work.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;ensure earmarked budgets are in place in each relevant Ministry – including human and technical resources – to fund such strategies over the short, mid and long-terms. Working to integrate prevention of violence against women and girls into all leading policy and funding frameworks can also provide strategic avenues and a broad base from which to strengthen efforts and secure budgets. Examples of these include poverty reduction and development strategies and national plans, and sector-wide reforms related to education, health, security, justice, HIV and AIDS, peace-building, transitional justice, reconstruction and conflict prevention strategies and frameworks in post-conflict situations, and contingency planning strategies and frameworks in settings affected by cyclical natural disasters.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;set specific targets and include mechanisms for monitoring progress towards them, across implementing institutions, and agencies in international/regional systems. Institutional responsibilities and reporting arrangements against these targets should be articulated, and mechanisms for accountability established. For example, regular and participatory multi-sectoral assessments at the national and local levels, across line ministries and related public sector institutions can strengthen accountability for performance in terms of agreed-upon budgetary commitments and/or related performance on budgetary allocations.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;aim to create an enabling environment for women’s and civil society organisations working on prevention of violence against women and girls. Resource allocation models should maximise collaboration between community organisations, and continuity of funding for programmes where they are shown to be effective through appropriate evaluation (see recommendation 131).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;include – across all settings and frameworks – efforts to engage men and boys in achieving gender equality and preventing violence, informed by the expertise of the women’s sector, and with mechanisms to ensure accountability to women and girls.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

''Recommendation 117''&lt;br /&gt;''
Experts further recommend that UN agencies mirror what is recognised as good practice for Governments above, and adopt a coordinated, interagency approach to prevent (and respond to) violence against women and girls, with support from the highest political level (i.e. the Secretary General). As part of the [[Global Implementation Plan to End Violence against Women and Girls|Global Implementation Plan]], UN agencies should develop a system-wide workplan building on related system-wide initiatives (e.g. the Secretary Generals’ [[UNiTE to End Violence Against Women|UNiTE Campaign]]) and through existing coordination mechanisms, to support and promote national implementation of, monitor progress against, and advance the international normative framework. Regional institutions should similarly develop and implement coordinated workplans to support Member States implement regional normative frameworks for prevention of violence against women and girls, monitor progress against these frameworks, and advance the frameworks themselves. Such workplans might include strategies to:
&lt;ol type="a"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Expand normative interpretations and understandings of prevention activity – beyond awareness-raising, education and sensitisation of the media – to make linkages with and encompass positive obligations on States to promote gender equality and change social norms contributing to gender stereotyping, discrimination and violence against women and girls, across all levels, jurisdictions, sectors and settings.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Provide policy guidance, technical advice and knowledge management to support States develop, implement and monitor holistic, systemic and sustained approaches to prevention.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ensure coordinated and sustained national and regional programming for prevention across different agencies and funding streams, and in different settings, such as conflict-affected contexts, natural disasters, low, middle and high-income countries (e.g. through UNDAFs, humanitarian funding streams, and in cooperation with regional bodies).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ensure outcomes and targets for prevention of violence against women and girls are a key component of the post-2015 development agenda.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

''Recommendation 118''&lt;br /&gt;''
'''In line with BPfA’s'''&lt;ref name="Source2"/&gt; '''Paragraph 124(k) ‘Adopt all appropriate measures, especially in the field of education, to modify the social and cultural patterns of conduct of men and women, and to eliminate prejudices, customary practices and all other practices based on the idea of the inferiority or superiority of either of the sexes and on stereotyped roles for men and women’,''' experts recommend that States:
&lt;ol type="a"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Develop, implement and monitor compulsory education promoting human rights and gender equality, challenging gender stereotypes, discrimination and violence against women and girls, and building skills for equal and respectful relationships and for peaceful conflict resolution, at all levels of schooling, from kindergarten to the tertiary level and in non-school educational settings.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Review teaching and learning materials to support the above, elaborating relevant curricula and materials in partnership with specialists on violence against women and girls, and ensuring that such education is gender-sensitive, comprehensive and fully integrated and includes assessment and reporting measures.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Provide for specialized training and resources for teaching and support staff to deliver the above curricula, implement gender-sensitive approaches to instruction through non-violent pedagogy, and support students who may disclose violence.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Support schools, tertiary institutions and other educational settings to promote broader ‘whole-school/institution cultures’ of equality, non-violence and respect, through engagement of leadership, events and extracurricular activities, and involvement of the community, as well as through policy and practice reform such as instigating institution-wide bans on all violence – including corporal punishment – and protocols and procedures for responding to violence, discrimination, bullying and harassment, whether in the staff-room, the classroom or elsewhere on the school/institution grounds.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Monitor and support girls’ completion of secondary schooling which multiple studies suggest is strongly protective against domestic and sexual violence.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

''Recommendation 119''&lt;br /&gt;''
'''In line with BPfA’s'''&lt;ref name="Source2"/&gt; '''Paragraph 126(a), calling for the development of ‘programmes and procedures to eliminate sexual harassment and other forms of violence against women in all educational institutions, workplaces and elsewhere,’''' experts make a number of recommendations to States, employers, trade unions, community and youth organisations and non-governmental organisations, as appropriate:
&lt;ol type="a"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Review regulatory frameworks, codes of conduct, protocols and procedures, of workplace, educational institutions, sporting clubs, community and faith organisations, the military, police and other organisational/institutional environments, to ensure they work to eliminate discrimination and harassment, and build organisational environments that are safe and inclusive of women and girls, and encourage women’s and girls’ participation and leadership.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Foster collaboration between employer and other organisations, and with women’s and other civil society organisations – especially those with expertise in engaging men and boys for gender equality – to recognise the role of organisations/institutions in prevention of violence against women and girls. Such a role is not only limited to addressing violence, discrimination and harassment within the organisation itself, but also extends to the organisation/institution as a ‘change-maker,’ capable of contributing to the transformation of attitudes, practices and social norms in their communities and society as a whole.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Develop and implement awareness-raising and bystander capacity-building initiatives for employees or other members of the organisation, especially those aimed at supporting men to proactively challenge men’s violence or early warning signs of such violence.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Identify women and men who can act as positive role models and ambassadors for prevention among employer and other organisations.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ensure protection and regulation in both the private and public sector for migrant workers to help combat harassment, discrimination and trafficking incidents.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

''Recommendation 120''&lt;br /&gt;''
'''In line with BPfA’s'''&lt;ref name="Source2"/&gt; '''Paragraph 125(e) calling for the organisation, support and funding of ‘community-based education and training campaigns to raise awareness about violence against women as a violation of women's enjoyment of their human rights and mobilis[ation of] local communities to use appropriate gender-sensitive traditional and innovative methods of conflict resolution,’''' experts recommend that States, local authorities, civil society organisations, communities and community organisations, promote gender equal and non-violent relationships, families and communities through new and existing holistic prevention efforts, services, programmes, events and grant/funding initiatives; prioritise prevention of violence against women and girls in grassroots efforts, urban and municipal planning; and implement legislative, regulatory and community-based programming initiatives to prevent violence and harassment of women and girls in private and public spaces.

''Recommendation 121''&lt;br /&gt;''
'''In line with BPfA’s'''&lt;ref name="Source2"/&gt; '''Paragraph 125(f), recognising, supporting and promoting ‘the fundamental role of intermediate institutions, such as primary health-care centres, family-planning centres, existing school health services, mother and baby protection services, centres for migrant families and so forth in the field of information and education related to abuse’''' experts recommend that States and partner organisations:
&lt;ol type="a"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Develop, implement and monitor programmes combining respectful relationships skills building and counselling support for children and young people, especially those who have been exposed to, or are identified as at risk of, violence.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Develop, implement and monitor intensive early-intervention programmes for children and young people demonstrating violence-supportive attitudes and/or who are using violence, recognising that this may be a result of prior victimisation and using a model that empowers them with the skills and inner resources for non-violent conflict resolution and healthy relationship-building.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Develop, implement and monitor positive and non-violent parenting programmes, including those specifically targeting fathers/men.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Integrate issues of gender equality and prevention of violence against women and girls into health and social welfare programmes including sexual, reproductive and maternal health, HIV-AIDS programmes, and programmes promoting equal, respectful and non-violent intimate and family relationships.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Support the role of these sectors in identifying women and girls at risk of violence and referring them to early intervention or response services.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

''Recommendation 122''&lt;br /&gt;''
'''In line with BPfA’s'''&lt;ref name="Source2"/&gt; '''Paragraphs 125(d) and (e), supporting ‘initiatives of women's organisations and non-governmental organisations all over the world to raise awareness on the issue of violence against women and to contribute to its elimination,’ and organising, supporting and funding ‘community-based education and training campaigns to raise awareness about violence against women as a violation of women's enjoyment of their human rights and mobilise local communities to use appropriate gender-sensitive traditional and innovative methods of conflict resolution,''' ’experts recommend that States, including local governments, with community organisations, non-governmental organisations, educational institutions, the public and private sectors, particularly enterprises, and the mass media, as appropriate, develop and implement – in concert with wider strategies above – social marketing, communications and holistic community mobilisation efforts addressing the underlying causes of violence against women and girls, such as through the promotion of positive, respectful and non-violent masculinities; challenging gender stereotypes; raising awareness of the unacceptability of violence; and promoting critical thinking within the community on violence against women and girls as a manifestation of inequality and a violation of women’s human rights.

''Recommendation 123''&lt;br /&gt;''
'''In line with BPfA’s'''&lt;ref name="Source2"/&gt; '''Paragraph 126(d) calling for ‘special measures to eliminate violence against women, particularly those in vulnerable situations, such as young women, refugee, displaced and internally displaced women, women with disabilities and women migrant workers, including enforcing any existing legislation and developing, as appropriate, new legislation for women migrant workers in both sending and receiving countries,''' ’experts recommend that States, employers, trade unions, community and youth organisations and non-governmental organisations, as appropriate, recognise the multiple vulnerabilities of women and girls to various forms of violence throughout their life cycle, and identify clear prevention activities and budgets for this work.

''Recommendation 124''&lt;br /&gt;''
'''In line with''' '''[[United Nations Security Council Resolution 1325|UNSCR 1325]]''', experts recommend that States ensure they have and implement action plans on women, peace and security, including comprehensive strategies to address the proliferation of small arms and armed violence, whether in conflict, post - conflict or ‘peacetime’ settings. Such initiatives should specifically include:
&lt;ol type="a"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The support of arms control and disarmament initiatives and policies that take into account the needs and perceptions of both men and women, namely through consultation and [[threat assessment]], and provide adequate incentives for participation, namely in regular campaigns of gun registry and civilian disarmament.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The harmonisation and implementation of laws that address domestic violence and firearms and ammunition – banning individuals with a history of violence from access to firearms, and ensuring guns are seized and gun licences suspended in domestic violence cases. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The improvement of the police officers’ capacity to conduct psychosocial evaluations, along with strengthened police training on violence against women and girls and the role of firearms, reaching beyond those working in special victim units.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The conduction of risk analysis in all centres for victim support, including assessing the presence of a weapon in the home.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

''Recommendation 125''&lt;br /&gt;''
'''In line with the UN General Assembly Special Session on HIV and AIDS, and the 2010 [[UN AIDS Agenda for Accelerated Country Action on Women, Girls, Gender Equality and HIV|UN AIDS Agenda for Accelerated Country Action on Women, Girls and HIV]]'''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.unfpa.org/webdav/site/global/shared/documents/publications/2010/agenda_for_accelerated_country_action_en.pdf UN AIDS Agenda for Accelerated Country Action on Women, Girls, Gender Equality and HIV.] Retrieved 28 February 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; '''and AIDS,''' integrate a focus on promoting gender equality, addressing gender based violence and engaging men and boys for gender equality into national AIDS plans.{{ref|J}}

===Research on the cause and consequences of violence against women and girls and the effectiveness of prevention measures===
[[File:Hand glass.png|thumb|''Research on the causes and consequences of violence against women and girls and the effectiveness of prevention measures.''(Recommendations 126 to 133)]]
''Recommendation 126''&lt;br /&gt;''
There are also several areas of work that States have already committed to under the BPfA&lt;ref name="Source2"/&gt; Strategic Objective D2 – to study the causes and consequences of violence against women and the effectiveness of preventive measures – upon which immediate action can be taken. Below are recommendations elaborated by the experts in support of these existing commitments.

''Recommendation 127''&lt;br /&gt;''
'''In line with BPfA’s'''&lt;ref name="Source2"/&gt; '''Paragraph 129(a) calling on Governments, regional organisations, the United Nations, other international organisations, research institutions, women's and youth organisations and non-governmental organisations, as appropriate, to ‘promote research, collect data and compile statistics, especially concerning domestic violence, relating to the prevalence of different forms of violence against women, and encourage research into the causes, nature, seriousness and consequences of violence against women and the effectiveness of measures implemented to prevent and redress violence against women’,''' experts make several recommendations:

''Recommendation 128''&lt;br /&gt;''
States should ensure the systematic collection, disaggregation (by gender, age and other characteristics), analysis and dissemination and use of data, including through supporting civil society organisations, academics and other actors engaged in research, to inform policy and strategy development on prevention. National statistical agencies and relevant ministries such as those of health or justice, should apply internationally agreed upon technical and ethical standards, ensuring consistency of concepts, regularity of data collection, and wide and timely dissemination of data. Government’s national machineries for the advancement of women should be closely associated with such efforts. Collaboration between producers and users of data should be strengthened by having users involved in all stages of data collection and dissemination. Data collection on violence against women and girls should be age-disaggregated and carried out in consultation with a wide range of stakeholders, including advocates and agencies providing services to women and girls, policymakers, legislators and researchers. It is also necessary that data be collected in a way that respects confidentiality and the rights of research participants and does not jeopardize their safety.

''Recommendation 129''&lt;br /&gt;''
International and national institutions, in partnership with research organisations, academia, and other civil society groups, should work together to identify gaps and improve research and data collection to inform prevention work, particularly in the following areas:
&lt;ol type="a"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Documenting the prevalence and characteristics of all forms of violence against women and girls, including violence experienced by particular groups of women and girls (such as women with disabilities, indigenous women, or women affected by armed conflict and/or natural disasters, to name a few), with implications for prevention programming.
ext for first item here.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Identifying risk and protective factors (for both victimisation and perpetration) and causal pathways for all forms of violence against women and girls.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

''Recommendation 130''&lt;br /&gt;''
International and regional institutions, in partnership with research organisations and academia, should examine processes for identifying and establishing intergovernmental agreement on common indicators to measure progress on the prevention of violence against women and girls at the international, national and local levels should be developed. Such indicators should be appropriate to the context and include both impact indicators that measure the reduction in levels of violence as well as indicators that measure short and medium term progress, such as changes in social norms, or organisational and community practices.

''Recommendation 131''&lt;br /&gt;''
States, donors and international/regional institutions should provide for the regular and comprehensive evaluation of projects and programmes on prevention, with feedback mechanisms for continuous improvement. Evaluative data on the effectiveness of prevention strategies in low and middle income countries should be developed and utilized in order to facilitate the replication, scaling up and institutionalization of the most effective interventions. Evaluations should be sensitive to the long-term and complex nature of the social change required for prevention, seeking to measurer not only reductions in levels of violence (which will only be apparent in the longer-term), but also shorter term indicators of change such as the shifts in attitudes, norms and practices referred to above.
&lt;ol type="a"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Evaluation should include a variety of methods including surveys, qualitative studies, administrative statistics/data and participatory approaches.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Methods used should be appropriate to the context and scale of the interventions.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Where appropriate and feasible, longitudinal studies should be conducted to enable measurement of change over time.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Evaluation should include also include measures of cost-effectiveness and feasibility of scaling up.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

''Recommendation 132''&lt;br /&gt;''
International and regional institutions, in partnership with research organisations and academia, should work together to develop practical tools and resources to support States and programmers in the elaboration, implementation and monitoring of prevention activity, for example:
&lt;ol type="a"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;[[Monitoring and evaluation]] tools that are practical and feasible for small-scale organisations and in low resource settings, including those affected by conflict and/or natural disasters.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Multi-dimensional evaluation strategies capable of capturing the learnings and outcomes from holistic and multi-sectoral strategies.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Tools for the collection and analysis of comparable statistical and qualitative data across countries relevant to prevention, building on existing methodologies such as the WHO Multi-country study, the ICRW and Instituto Promundo International Men and Gender Equality Survey and the P4P multi-country Change Project surveys, and research learnings emerging from the previous recommendations.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Methodologies for cost-benefit analyses of prevention activity, covering not only the saving of longer-term reduced prevalence of violence itself, but also the mid-term social and economic benefits of increased institutional capacity, early intervention, increased gender equality, etc, and guidance for costing and financing prevention strategies. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

''Recommendation 133''&lt;br /&gt;''
International and regional institutions, civil society organisations, States and research institutions should support the development of ‘learning labs’ to produce new knowledge, design, test and share innovative approaches for the prevention of violence against women and girls. An international research and programming centre/institution for prevention might be envisaged to this end, providing guidance, tools and oversight for the activities described above, and potentially playing a role in the independent monitoring of the [[Global Implementation Plan to End Violence against Women and Girls|Global Implementation Plan.]]

'''''Emerging evidence and practice have highlighted further issues for prevention of violence against women and girls only partially covered by the existing normative framework, and experts have identified specific areas of action responding to these (detailed under the sub-headings below).'''''

===Mass and new media===
{{See also|Sexualization (as a political term)}}
[[File:Computer-globe.png|thumb|''Mass and new media.'' (Recommendations 134 to 136)]]
''Recommendation 134''&lt;br /&gt;''
'''In line with BPfA’s'''&lt;ref name="Source2"/&gt; '''Paragraph 125(j) calling for awareness raising on ‘the responsibility of the media in promoting non-stereotyped images of women and men, as well as in eliminating patterns of media presentation that generate violence, and encourage those responsible for media content to establish professional guidelines and codes of conduct’ and on ‘the important role of the media in informing and educating people about the causes and effects of violence against women and in stimulating public debate on the topic,’''' experts recommend that States, including local governments, community organisations, non-governmental organisations, educational institutions, the public and private sectors, particularly enterprises, and the mass media, as appropriate:
&lt;ol type="a"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Strengthen regulatory frameworks with regard to media, advertising imagery, texts, games and other popular culture mediums which portray women or girls in a discriminatory, degrading or stereotypical way, or which glorify violent masculinities.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Engage all media agencies that currently produce, or provide platforms for the distribution of, material/content which objectifies girls and women and/or which promote/distort messages around violence against girls and women, through a partnership approach, for example co-regulation. This includes the internet, mass media, music and games industries, and advertisers.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Build partnerships with journalists and other media professionals for the prevention of violence against women and girls and the promotion of gender equality, such as through training, guidelines and awards.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Include dedicated resources in national media outlets for organisational and content development supporting gender equality and non-discrimination.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Support advocates such as victims/survivors of violence, men committed to non-violence, and high-profile people to respond to enquiries from journalists and speak at events on issues of violence against women and girls, and to promote messages of gender equality and non violence.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Promote inclusion and visibility of women at national conferences and in local and national media to challenge negative gender stereotypes and promote images of women leaders, intellectuals, politicians, etc.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Use the media to educate, inform and engage citizens on women’s rights, in particular engaging women voters on women’s issues.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

''Recommendation 135''&lt;br /&gt;''
In addition to the recommendations made in line with BPfA’s&lt;ref name="Source2"/&gt; Paragraph 125(j) above, wider and long term action is needed to address the role the media currently plays in contributing to, maintaining and reinforcing, gender stereotypes. Experts recommend that all stakeholders above take immediate interim action to provide children and young people with media literacy skills as a core aspect of school curricula. This should aim to build gender analysis skills to interrogate the status quo (i.e. the objectification of girls and women), critique constructions of gender roles and offer alternative interpretations and framings of the content that they are engaging with on a daily basis.

''Recommendation 136''&lt;br /&gt;''
'''In line with BPfA’s'''&lt;ref name="Source2"/&gt; '''Paragraph 129(d), encouraging ‘the media to examine the impact of gender role stereotypes, including those perpetuated by commercial advertisements which foster gender-based violence and inequalities, and how they are transmitted during the life cycle, and [to]take measures to eliminate these negative images with a view to promoting a violence-free society,’''' experts recommend that international/regional organisations, States, research institutions, civil society partners and media organisations, as appropriate:
&lt;ol type="a"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Commit to the research and development of urgently needed guidance (and where appropriate, regulatory action) for the prevention and prohibition of discrimination against women and girls and gender stereotyping across all media. This includes guidance on both the development and the distribution of material.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Fully implement the Convention for the Rights of the Child (Article 17) which recognises the importance of mass media and calls on states to develop ‘appropriate guidelines for the protection of the child from information and material injurious to his or her well-being.’&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Recognise that media is an influential mechanism that can make a real difference to a larger project of preventing violence against women and girls. As such, work with media should not just be focussed on limiting harm, but should also be focussed on media making a positive difference e.g. responsible reporting of violence against women and girls which provides accurate information and a gendered analysis (i.e. one which interrogates dominant masculinities and recognises and challenges male privilege).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Engage with the UN Special Rapporteur on the promotion and protection of the right to freedom of opinion and expression as he considers issues of balancing the right to freedom of expression with the right to be protected from discrimination, with a view to contributing to and building on his recommendations to support prevention of violence against women and girls. Similarly, engage with the International Telecommunications Union as it considers the issue of internet regulation at its December 2012 conference.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

===The global financial crisis and geo-politics===
[[File:TED Spread.png|thumb|''The global financial crisis and geo-politics.'' (Recommendations 137 to 139)]]
''Recommendation 137''&lt;br /&gt;
Given the likely negative impact of the global financial crisis on levels of violence against women and girls, and the subsequent economic, health and social costs of such increased violence (in terms of reduced productivity, strains on services, etc.), experts recommend that States, international and regional institutions, civil society, the private sector and other stakeholders, should proactively and collaboratively work to protect women’s and girls’ right to live free of violence, in order to ‘stem the tide’ of negative economic, health and social impacts arising from such violence and their subsequent further costs to the State.

''Recommendation 138''&lt;br /&gt;
International and regional organisations, donors, development agencies, philanthropics and other non-governmental organisations should ensure that allocations of aid funding in the wake of the crisis support programmes
to prevent (and respond to) violence against women and girls and promote women’s human rights.

''Recommendation 139''&lt;br /&gt;
International and regional institutions, civil society organisations and established donors should engage emerging middle income countries and new donors in the development of the new [[Global Implementation Plan to End Violence against Women and Girls]] and encourage a rights-based approach to aid investment that prioritises prevention of violence against women and girls through this international, target-focussed framework.

===Urban, serious youth (e.g. gang) and armed violence===
[[File:Gun outline.svg|thumb|''Urban, serious youth (e.g. gang) and armed violence.'' (Recommendation 140)]]
''Recommendation 140''&lt;br /&gt;
Experts recommend that States, non-governmental organisations, international/regional institutions and other stakeholders as appropriate:
&lt;ol type="a"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Support investigations into the relationship between violence against women and girls and armed violence, especially thestrategies of gender-based violence used within and between rival armed groups and the use and threat of gender-based violence in the private sphere by members of armed groups, especially with guns. Research should also be undertaken on the link between intimate partner / domestic violence and armed violence, including the collection of data on the role of firearms in violence against women and girls.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Increase collaboration between those working on violence against women and girls and those working on arms control at the local, national and international public policy levels.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Develop, implement and monitor policies and programmes aimed at preventing and/or reducing armed violence specifically against girls and women locally and nationally that include gender-responsive protection measures in child and adolescent law and education systems.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Develop, implement and monitor tailored strategies for girls and women who are involved in/associated with armed violence, and for girl children and adolescents at risk, with their active participation at all stages.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Strengthen crime prevention policies to ensure a review of, and action on, the differential impact of urban violence on violence against women and girls, and by the same token, explicitly consider the impact of urban, serious youth (e.g. gang) or armed violence in policies or strategies for the prevention of violence against women and girls.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Invest in knowledge creation and data collection on the typologies and motivations of young men’s and women’s involvement in armed and violent criminality, especially in contexts with significant gun violence rates, as well as research on armed violence victims/survivors and witnesses, recognising that the decision to join gangs and other armed groups may be fuelled by social exclusion, family violence and violence experienced while in prison or at the hand of state security forces.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Support the strengthening of community policing initiatives, including specially trained officers with a focus on youth and family violence, violence against women and girls, and on human rights. Promote greater collaboration between police forces and other security sectors for community-based prevention efforts.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Integrate, strengthen and expand professional and vocational training programmes into socio-educational, juvenile justice and prison systems that are designed according to needs-based assessments, and including curricula on the gendered drivers and consequences of gun violence. Encourage and facilitate community reintegration approaches, including through supporting work with communities to prevent stigmatisation of youth who wish to reintegrate themselves into the community in a non-violent way.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Engage urban young people in the development of public policies across key areas such as employment, revitalisation of marginalised neighbourhoods and housing, and cultural initiatives. Build the capacity of institutions and civil society organisations to harness the potential of young people to foster change, and position them as active protagonists in programme development, implementation and monitoring.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

===Humanitarian crises related to conflict and natural disasters===
[[File:CasaDestruidaFriburgo2011.jpg|thumb|''Humanitarian crises related to conflict and natural disasters''. (Recommendation 141)]]
''Recommendation 141''&lt;br /&gt;
Experts noted the lack of documented prevention strategies for settings affected by conflict and/or natural disasters, and the consequent improvised, small-scale, and/or issue-specific nature of prevention activities in these settings. They emphasised that it is critical that States – and the humanitarian, peacekeeping, civil society and development actors with whom they engage – institute broad, well-coordinated measures to prevent violence against women and girls in all stages of humanitarian intervention, and ensure that those measures incorporate strategies that reach the most vulnerable, as well as monitoring and evaluation components in order to develop an evidence base for good practice. To this end, experts recommend that States and their humanitarian partners:
&lt;ol type="a"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Integrate prevention into all contingency planning for humanitarian emergencies, and develop early warning systems to assess and avert the risk of violence against women and girls. Contingency planning and early warning strategies should engage women and girls in the affected communities in order to anticipate protection needs and develop, for example, community alert networks, safe spaces for women and girls, access to reproductive and sexual health care, widespread information about the illegality of violence against women and girls and the consequences for perpetrators. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;When a crisis strikes, immediately institute protections across all areas of humanitarian response, according to the IASC ''Guidelines for Gender-based Violence Interventions in Humanitarian Settings''. Collect disaggregated data to identify the particular security needs of women and girls and develop targeted tools and guidelines to facilitate protection from and prevention of violence against women and girls, including protection from sexual exploitation and abuse committed by humanitarian actors against beneficiaries of humanitarian aid. Work with international and local human rights organisations to monitor the activities of armed groups to ensure that they adhere to the rules of combat, and are prohibited from, and held accountable for, violence against women and girls. All peacekeeping operations must act in accordance with the standards set forth in the UNSCRs on Women, Peace and Security.{{ref|K}}&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;After the initial emergency has passed and when working towards reconstruction, collaborate to expand prevention efforts and facilitate durable solutions for lasting peace and security. This includes incorporating prevention of violence against women and girls as an integral component of post-conflict and post-disaster action plans, including national action plans on Women, Peace and Security, and throughout all transition and recovery strategies. Ensure these action plans are multi-sectoral and supported by widespread protective legislation as well as capacity building across all key sectors to monitor and address risks for violence.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In the reconstruction phase, undertake programming to build social and economic assets of women and girls in order to limit their future exposure to violence, through, for example, education, livelihoods, lifeskills, and leadership. Support women’s and girls’ empowerment in new and existing constitutions, bolstered by national mechanisms, government programs, and civil society partnerships, particularly women’s organisations addressing violence against women and girls. Identify and address risks related to perpetration of violence, particularly amongst boys who have been exposed to violence and in terms of limiting the availability of small arms.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In post-conflict settings, ensure the inclusion of women and girls in peace-building efforts at the national and local levels. Include elements addressing violence against women and girls committed during conflict in all peace agreements. Ensure that survivors have safe access to on-going care and treatment in all conflict-related transitional justice and reparations programmes. Include an emphasis on the special needs of women and girls who were part of fighting forces in programmes for disarmament, demobilisation and reintegration, and efforts to prevent future violence against women and girls, including by demobilised male soldiers. Work with families and communities to overcome prejudice and discrimination against women ex-combatants and women heads of household. Ensure an end to impunity by integrating prevention of (and response to) violence against women and girls into all security sector and justice reform.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

===Girls, adolescent girls and young women===
[[File:Young girl applying cosmetics.jpg|thumb|''Girls, adolescent girls and young women.'' (Recommendation 142)]]
''Recommendation 142''&lt;br /&gt;
Experts recognised that girls, including adolescent girls, and young women are often excluded from, or ‘squeezed into,’ interventions which are focussed on adult women, on boys and young men, or on children in a gender-neutral way. Experts concluded that an emphasis on prevention work specifically tailored to the needs, experiences and aspirations of girls,
adolescent girls and young women is urgently needed; acknowledging the complexities of the current landscape that they are required to negotiate. Experts made the following recommendations to States, women’s and civil society organisations, international and regional institutions, public and private sectors, as appropriate:
&lt;ol type="a"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Develop, implement and monitor tailored prevention activity with adolescent girls and young women that takes an empowerment, not protection, approach, and explicitly address their needs and rights, informed by the voices of adolescent girls and young women themselves. The onus is often placed on girls and young women to avoid / stop violence from happening to them rather than on developing widespread and embedded activities which challenge the social norms that permeate their lives. Prevention programmes should therefore address what is happening around young people (e.g. social pressures, media messaging and so forth) rather than purely on helping young women to ‘manage’ their adolescence (and the risks of violence this is assumed to entail) more effectively.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Support all adolescents and young people to understand the nature of consent and coercion, and the impact of social and environmental factors on individual ability to truly provide consent (e.g. with key messages such as ''‘your '''yes''' is only as good as your ability to say '''no'''''’). The issue of consent, and especially sexual consent, is complex and is widely misunderstood among many adults. Yet adolescent girls and young women are often expected to be able to negotiate this difficult terrain which is focussed exclusively on the nature of a ‘no’ rather than the expectation that what is required is a strong, enthusiastic ‘yes’. This in turn reinforces notions of female passivity (the object of pursuit) and male aggressor (the pursuer). Such activities would have relevance to a number of areas from teen relationships to forced marriage.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ensure a gender dimension is incorporated into multi-sectoral legislative, policy and programmatic development to prevent (and respond to) violence against children, taking into account the specific needs, vulnerabilities and voices of girls of all ages.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

'''''Edmond de Belamy''''' is a [[generative adversarial network]] [[portrait painting]] constructed in 2018 by Paris-based arts-collective ''Obvious.''&lt;ref name="cnn"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://edition.cnn.com/style/article/obvious-ai-art-christies-auction-smart-creativity/index.html|title=AI-produced artwork sells for $433K, smashing expectations - CNN Style|website=edition.cnn.com|accessdate=2018-10-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; Printed on canvas, the work belongs to a series of generative images called '''La Famille de Belamy'''.  It achieved widespread notoriety after [[Christie's]] announced its intention to auction the piece as the first artwork created using [[Artificial Intelligence]] to be featured in a Christie's auction. It surpassed pre-auction esimates which valued it at $7,000 to $10,000, instead selling for $432,500.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.christies.com/Lotfinder/lot_details.aspx?sid=&amp;intObjectID=6166184&amp;T=Lot&amp;language=en|title=Edmond de Belamy, from La Famille de Belamy|publisher=|accessdate=29 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2018/10/25/arts/design/ai-art-sold-christies.html|title=AI Art at Christie’s Sells for $432,500|publisher=|accessdate=29 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The piece is a portrait of a somewhat-blurry man. It is a print on canvas measuring 27 ½ x 27 ½ in (700 x 700 mm.) set within a gilded wood frame. The image was created by an algorithm that referenced 15,000 portraits from various periods. 

It is signed at the bottom right with "min G max D x [log (D(x))] + z [log(1 -- D (G(z)))]", which is part of the algorithm code that produced it.

The organization that produced it is called Obvious. It is a collective comprising three people, Pierre Fautrel, Hugo Caselles-Dupré and Gauthier Vernier, who are based in Paris, France.

The piece has been criticized because it was created using a [[generative adversarial network]] (GAN) software package based on prior research by others, including [[Ian Goodfellow]], and implemented by a developer who was not affiliated with Obvious, leading to allegations that Obvious contributed minimally to the final work product. Posts on the project's issue tracker show Obvious members requesting that the original developer provide support and custom features. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=How three French students used borrowed code to put the first AI portrait in Christie’s | publisher=The Verge | date=23 October 2018 | url=https://www.theverge.com/2018/10/23/18013190/ai-art-portrait-auction-christies-belamy-obvious-robbie-barrat-gans | access-date=17 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When the star's or planet's net [[emissivity]] in the relevant wavelength band is less than unity (less than that of a [[black body]]), the actual temperature of the body will be higher than the effective temperature.  The net emissivity may be low due to surface or atmospheric properties, including [[greenhouse effect]].

The effective temperature of a [[star]] is the temperature of a [[black body]] with the same luminosity per ''surface area'' ({{math|{{mathcal|F}}&lt;sub&gt;Bol&lt;/sub&gt;}}) as the star and is defined according to the [[Stefan–Boltzmann law]] {{math|{{mathcal|F}}&lt;sub&gt;Bol&lt;/sub&gt; {{=}} ''σT''&lt;sub&gt;eff&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;}}.

Both effective temperature and bolometric luminosity depend on the chemical composition of a star.

The effective temperature of our Sun is around 5780&amp;nbsp;[[kelvin]]s (K).&lt;ref name="Ref_"&gt;{{Cite book |editor-last=Lide |editor-first=David R. |section=Properties of the Solar System |publisher=[[CRC Press]] |title=CRC Handbook of Chemistry and Physics |section-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=WDll8hA006AC&amp;pg=SA14-PA2 |edition=85th |page=14&lt;nowiki&gt;-&lt;/nowiki&gt;2 |date=2004 |isbn=9780849304859}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Jones2004"&gt;{{cite book|title=Life in the Solar System and Beyond|first=Barrie William|last=Jones|page=7|publisher = [[Springer Science+Business Media|Springer]]|date=2004|isbn=1-85233-101-1| url=https://books.google.com/books?id=MmsWioMDiN8C&amp;pg=PA7&amp;dq=%22effective+temperature+of+the+sun%22}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Stars have a decreasing temperature gradient, going from their central core up to the atmosphere. The "core temperature" of the Sun—the temperature at the centre of the Sun where nuclear reactions take place—is estimated to be 15,000,000&amp;nbsp;K.

The [[color index]] of a star indicates its temperature from the very cool—by stellar standards—red M stars that radiate heavily in the [[infrared]] to the very hot blue O stars that radiate largely in the [[ultraviolet]]. The effective temperature of a star indicates the amount of heat that the star radiates per unit of surface area. From the warmest surfaces to the coolest is the sequence of [[stellar classification]]s known as O, B, A, F, G, K, M.

A red star could be a tiny [[red dwarf]], a star of feeble energy production and a small surface or a bloated giant or even [[supergiant]] star such as [[Antares]] or [[Betelgeuse]], either of which generates far greater energy but passes it through a surface so large that the star radiates little per unit of surface area. A star near the middle of the spectrum, such as the modest [[Sun]] or the giant [[Capella (star)|Capella]] radiates more energy per unit of surface area than the feeble red dwarf stars or the bloated supergiants, but much less than such a white or blue star as [[Vega]] or [[Rigel]].

== Planet ==
{{Main|Planetary equilibrium temperature}}

===Blackbody temperature===

The effective (blackbody) temperature of a [[planet]] can be calculated by equating the power received by the planet with the power emitted by a blackbody of temperature {{mvar|T}}.

Take the case of a planet at a distance {{mvar|D}} from the star, of [[luminosity]] {{mvar|L}}.

Assuming the star radiates isotropically and that the planet is a long way from the star, the power absorbed by the planet is given by treating the planet as a disc of radius {{mvar|r}}, which intercepts some of the power which is spread over the surface of a sphere of radius {{mvar|D}} (the distance of the planet from the star). The calculation assumes the planet reflects some of the incoming radiation by incorporating a parameter called the [[albedo]] (a). An albedo of 1 means that all the radiation is reflected, an albedo of 0 means all of it is absorbed. The expression for absorbed power is then:

:&lt;math&gt;P_{\rm abs} = \frac {L r^2 (1-a)}{4 D^2}&lt;/math&gt;

The next assumption we can make is that the entire planet is at the same temperature {{mvar|T}}, and that the planet radiates as a blackbody. The [[Stefan–Boltzmann law]] gives an expression for the power radiated by the planet:

:&lt;math&gt;P_{\rm rad} = 4 \pi r^2 \sigma T^4&lt;/math&gt;

Equating these two expressions and rearranging gives an expression for the effective temperature:

:&lt;math&gt;T = \sqrt[4]{\frac{L (1-a)}{16 \pi \sigma D^2}}&lt;/math&gt;

Note that the planet's radius has cancelled out of the final expression.

The effective temperature for [[Jupiter]] from this calculation is 88&amp;nbsp;K and [[51 Pegasi b]] (Bellerophon) is 1,258&amp;nbsp;K.{{Citation needed|date=December 2011}}  A better estimate of effective temperature for some planets, such as Jupiter, would need to include the [[internal heating]] as a power input.  The actual temperature depends on [[albedo]] and [[atmosphere]] effects. The actual temperature from [[spectroscopic analysis]] for [[HD 209458 b]] (Osiris) is 1,130&amp;nbsp;K, but the effective temperature is 1,359&amp;nbsp;K.{{Citation needed|date=December 2011}} The internal heating within Jupiter raises the effective temperature to about 152&amp;nbsp;K.{{Citation needed|date=December 2011}}

===Surface temperature of a planet===

The surface temperature of a planet can be estimated by modifying the effective-temperature calculation to account for emissivity and temperature variation.

The area of the planet that absorbs the power from the star is {{math|''A''&lt;sub&gt;abs&lt;/sub&gt;}} which is some fraction of the total surface area {{math|''A''&lt;sub&gt;total&lt;/sub&gt; {{=}} 4π''r''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;}}, where {{mvar|r}} is the radius of the planet. This area intercepts some of the power which is spread over the surface of a sphere of radius {{mvar|D}}. We also allow the planet to reflect some of the incoming radiation by incorporating a parameter {{mvar|a}} called the [[albedo]]. An albedo of 1 means that all the radiation is reflected, an albedo of 0 means all of it is absorbed. The expression for absorbed power is then:

:&lt;math&gt;P_{\rm abs} = \frac {L A_{\rm abs} (1-a)}{4 \pi D^2}&lt;/math&gt;

The next assumption we can make is that although the entire planet is not at the same temperature, it will radiate as if it had a temperature {{mvar|T}} over an area {{math|''A''&lt;sub&gt;rad&lt;/sub&gt;}} which is again some fraction of the total area of the planet. There is also a factor {{mvar|ε}}, which is the [[emissivity]] and represents atmospheric effects. {{mvar|ε}} ranges from 1 to 0 with 1 meaning the planet is a perfect blackbody and emits all the incident power. The [[Stefan–Boltzmann law]] gives an expression for the power radiated by the planet:

:&lt;math&gt;P_{\rm rad} = A_{\rm rad} \varepsilon \sigma T^4&lt;/math&gt;

Equating these two expressions and rearranging gives an expression for the surface temperature:

:&lt;math&gt;T = \sqrt[4]{\frac{A_{\rm abs}}{A_{\rm rad}} \frac{L (1-a)}{4 \pi \sigma \varepsilon D^2} }&lt;/math&gt;

Note the ratio of the two areas. Common assumptions for this ratio are {{sfrac|[[Area of a disk|1]]|[[Sphere#Surface area|4]]}} for a rapidly rotating body and {{sfrac|1|2}} for a slowly rotating body, or a tidally locked body on the sunlit side. This ratio would be 1 for the [[subsolar point]], the point on the planet directly below the sun and gives the maximum temperature of the planet — a factor of {{sqrt|2}} (1.414) greater than the effective temperature of a rapidly rotating planet.&lt;ref&gt;Swihart, Thomas. "Quantitative Astronomy". Prentice Hall, 1992, Chapter 5, Section 1.&lt;/ref&gt;

Also note here that this equation does not take into account any effects from internal heating of the planet, which can arise directly from sources such as [[radioactive decay]] and also be produced from frictions resulting from [[tidal forces]].

===Earth Effective Temperature===
{{main|Earth's energy budget}}

The Earth has an albedo of about 0.306.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nssdc.gsfc.nasa.gov/planetary/factsheet/earthfact.html|title=Earth Fact Sheet|author=|date=|website=nssdc.gsfc.nasa.gov|accessdate=8 May 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101030234253/http://nssdc.gsfc.nasa.gov/planetary/factsheet/earthfact.html|archivedate=30 October 2010|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The emissivity is dependent on the type of surface and many [[climate models]] set the value of the Earth's emissivity to 1. However, a more realistic value is 0.96.&lt;ref&gt;Jin, Menglin and Shunlin Liang, (2006) “An Improved Land Surface Emissivity Parameter for Land Surface Models Using Global Remote Sensing Observations” Journal of Climate, 19 2867-81. (www.glue.umd.edu/~sliang/papers/Jin2006.emissivity.pdf)&lt;/ref&gt; The Earth is a fairly fast rotator so the area ratio can be estimated as {{sfrac|1|4}}. The other variables are constant. This calculation gives us an effective temperature of the Earth of {{cvt|252|K|°C|0}}. The average temperature of the Earth is {{cvt|288|K|°C|0}}. One reason for the difference between the two values is due to the [[greenhouse effect]], which increases the average temperature of the Earth's surface.

'''Electromagnetism''' is a branch of [[physics]] involving the study of the '''electromagnetic force''', a type of [[physical interaction]] that occurs between [[electric charge|electrically charged]] particles. The electromagnetic force usually exhibits [[electromagnetic field]]s such as [[electric field]]s, [[magnetic field]]s, and [[light]], and is one of the four [[fundamental interaction]]s (commonly called forces) in [[nature]]. The other three fundamental interactions are the [[strong interaction]], the [[weak interaction]], and [[gravitation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Ravaioli|first1=Fawwaz T. Ulaby, Eric Michielssen, Umberto|title=Fundamentals of applied electromagnetics|date=2010|publisher=Prentice Hall|location=Boston|isbn=978-0-13-213931-1|page=13|edition=6th|ref=Ulaby13}}&lt;!--|accessdate=6 November 2014--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; At high energy the weak force and electromagnetic force are unified as a single [[electroweak interaction|electroweak force]].
[[File:Lightning.0257.jpg|thumb|[[Lightning]] is an [[electrostatic discharge]] that travels between two charged regions.]]
Electromagnetic phenomena are defined in terms of the electromagnetic force, sometimes called the [[Lorentz force]], which includes both [[electricity]] and [[magnetism]] as different manifestations of the same phenomenon. The electromagnetic force plays a major role in determining the internal properties of most objects encountered in daily life.  Ordinary matter takes its form as a result of [[intermolecular force]]s between individual atoms and [[molecule]]s in matter, and is a manifestation of the electromagnetic force. [[Electron]]s are bound by the electromagnetic force to [[atomic nuclei]], and their orbital shapes and their influence on nearby atoms with their electrons is described by quantum mechanics. The electromagnetic force governs all chemical processes, which arise from interactions between the [[Molecular orbital|electrons]] of neighboring atoms.

There are numerous [[mathematical descriptions of the electromagnetic field]].  In [[classical electrodynamics]], electric fields are described as [[electric potential]] and [[electric current]]. In [[Faraday law of induction|Faraday's law]], [[magnetic field]]s are associated with [[electromagnetic induction]] and magnetism, and [[Maxwell's equations]] describe how electric and magnetic fields are generated and altered by each other and by charges and currents.

The theoretical implications of electromagnetism, particularly the establishment of the speed of light based on properties of the "medium" of propagation ([[permeability (electromagnetism)|permeability]] and [[permittivity]]), led to the development of [[special relativity]] by [[Albert Einstein]] in 1905.

==History of the theory==
[[File:Ørsted.jpg|thumb|140px|[[Hans Christian Ørsted]].]]
{{See also|History of electromagnetic theory}}

Originally, electricity and magnetism were considered to be two separate forces. This view changed, however, with the publication of [[James Clerk Maxwell]]'s 1873 ''[[A Treatise on Electricity and Magnetism]]'' in which the interactions of positive and negative charges were shown to be mediated by one force. There are four main effects resulting from these interactions, all of which have been clearly demonstrated by experiments:
# Electric charges ''{{vanchor|attract}}'' or ''{{vanchor|repel}}'' one another with a force [[Proportionality (mathematics)#Inverse proportionality|inversely proportional]] to the square of the distance between them: unlike charges attract, like ones repel.
# Magnetic poles (or states of polarization at individual points) attract or repel one another in a manner similar to positive and negative charges and always exist as pairs: every north pole is yoked to a south pole.
# An electric current inside a wire creates a corresponding circumferential magnetic field outside the wire.  Its direction (clockwise or counter-clockwise) depends on the direction of the current in the wire.
# A current is induced in a loop of wire when it is moved toward or away from a magnetic field, or a magnet is moved towards or away from it; the direction of current depends on that of the movement.

[[File:Andre-marie-ampere2.jpg|thumb|140px|left|[[André-Marie Ampère]]]]
While preparing for an evening lecture on 21 April 1820, [[Hans Christian Ørsted]] made a surprising observation. As he was setting up his materials, he noticed a [[compass needle]] deflected away from [[magnetic north]] when the electric current from the battery he was using was switched on and off. This deflection convinced him that magnetic fields radiate from all sides of a wire carrying an electric current, just as light and heat do, and that it confirmed a direct relationship between electricity and magnetism.
[[File:SS-faraday.jpg|thumb|140px|[[Michael Faraday]]]]
At the time of discovery, Ørsted did not suggest any satisfactory explanation of the phenomenon, nor did he try to represent the phenomenon in a mathematical framework. However, three months later he began more intensive investigations. Soon thereafter he published his findings, proving that an electric current produces a magnetic field as it flows through a wire. The [[CGS]] unit of [[Electromagnetic induction|magnetic induction]] ([[oersted]]) is named in honor of his contributions to the field of electromagnetism.

[[File:James-clerk-maxwell3.jpg|thumb|left|140px|[[James Clerk Maxwell]]]]
His findings resulted in intensive research throughout the scientific community in [[electrodynamics]]. They influenced French physicist [[André-Marie Ampère]]'s developments of a single mathematical form to represent the magnetic forces between current-carrying conductors. Ørsted's discovery also represented a major step toward a unified concept of energy.

This unification, which was observed by [[Michael Faraday]], extended by [[James Clerk Maxwell]], and partially reformulated by [[Oliver Heaviside]] and [[Heinrich Hertz]], is one of the key accomplishments of 19th century [[mathematical physics]]. It has had far-reaching consequences, one of which was the understanding of the nature of [[light]]. Unlike what was proposed by the electromagnetic theory of that time, light and other [[electromagnetic radiation|electromagnetic waves]] are at present seen as taking the form of [[quantum|quantized]], self-propagating [[oscillation|oscillatory]] electromagnetic field disturbances called [[photon]]s. Different [[frequency|frequencies]] of oscillation give rise to the different forms of [[electromagnetic radiation]], from [[radio wave]]s at the lowest frequencies, to visible light at intermediate frequencies, to [[gamma ray]]s at the highest frequencies.

Ørsted was not the only person to examine the relationship between electricity and magnetism. In 1802, [[Gian Domenico Romagnosi]], an Italian legal scholar, deflected a magnetic needle using a Voltaic pile. The factual setup of the experiment is not completely clear, so if current flew across the needle or not. An account of the discovery was published in 1802 in an Italian newspaper, but it was largely overlooked by the contemporary scientific community, because Romagnosi seemingly did not belong to this community.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Martins |first1=Roberto de Andrade |title=Nuova Voltiana: Studies on Volta and his Times |chapter=Romagnosi and Volta's Pile: Early Difficulties in the Interpretation of Voltaic Electricity |volume=vol. 3 |editors=Fabio Bevilacqua and Lucio Fregonese (eds) |publisher=Università degli Studi di Pavia |pages=81–102 |url=http://ppp.unipv.it/collana/pages/libri/saggi/nuova%20voltiana3_pdf/cap4/4.pdf |accessdate=2010-12-02 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130530200951/http://ppp.unipv.it/Collana/Pages/Libri/Saggi/Nuova%20Voltiana3_PDF/cap4/4.pdf |archivedate=2013-05-30 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

An earlier (1735), and often neglected, connection between electricity and magnetism was reported by a Dr. Cookson.&lt;ref&gt;  VIII. An account of an extraordinary effect of lightning in communicating magnetism. Communicated by Pierce Dod, M.D. F. R. S. from Dr. Cookson of Wakefield in Yorkshire.
Phil. Trans. 1735 39, 74-75, published 1 January 1735 &lt;/ref&gt; The account stated, "A tradesman at Wakefield in Yorkshire, having put up a great number of knives and forks in a large box ...  and having placed the box in the corner of a large room, there happened a sudden storm of thunder, lightning, &amp;c.  ... The owner emptying the box on a counter where some nails lay, the persons who took up the knives, that lay on the nails, observed that the knives took up the nails. On this the whole number was tried, and found
to do the same, and that, to such a degree as to take up large nails, packing
needles, and other iron things of considerable weight ..."   [[E. T. Whittaker]] suggested in 1910 that 
this particular event was responsible for lightning to be "credited with the power of magnetizing steel; and it was doubtless this which led Franklin in 1751 to attempt to magnetize a sewing-needle by means of the discharge of Leyden jars." &lt;ref&gt; Whittaker, E.

The electromagnetic force is one of the four known [[fundamental force]]s. The other fundamental forces are:
* the [[weak interaction|weak nuclear force]], which binds to all known particles in the [[Standard Model]], and causes certain forms of [[radioactive decay]]. (In [[particle physics]] though, the [[electroweak interaction]] is the unified description of two of the four known fundamental interactions of nature: electromagnetism and the weak interaction);
* the [[strong interaction|strong nuclear force]], which binds [[quark]]s to form [[nucleon]]s, and binds nucleons to form [[Atomic nucleus|nuclei]]
* the [[gravity|gravitational force]].
All other forces (e.g., [[friction]], contact forces) are derived from these four fundamental forces (including momentum which is carried by the movement of particles).&lt;ref&gt;Browne, "Physics for Engineering and Science," p 160: "Gravity is one of the fundamental forces of nature. The other forces such as friction, tension, and the normal force are derived from the electric force, another of the fundamental forces. Gravity is a rather weak force... The electric force between two protons is much stronger than the gravitational force between them."&lt;/ref&gt;

The electromagnetic force is responsible for practically all phenomena one encounters in daily life above the nuclear scale, with the exception of gravity. Roughly speaking, all the forces involved in interactions between [[atom]]s can be explained by the electromagnetic force acting between the electrically charged [[Atomic nucleus|atomic nuclei]] and [[electron]]s of the atoms. Electromagnetic forces also explain how these particles carry momentum by their movement. This includes the forces we experience in "pushing" or "pulling" ordinary material objects, which result from the [[intermolecular force]]s that act between the individual [[molecule]]s in our bodies and those in the objects. The electromagnetic force is also involved in all forms of [[chemistry|chemical phenomena]].

A necessary part of understanding the intra-atomic and intermolecular forces is the effective force generated by the momentum of the electrons' movement, such that as electrons move between interacting atoms they carry momentum with them. As a collection of electrons becomes more confined, their minimum momentum necessarily increases due to the [[Uncertainty principle|Pauli exclusion principle]]. The behaviour of matter at the molecular scale including its density is determined by the balance between the electromagnetic force and the force generated by the exchange of momentum carried by the electrons themselves.&lt;ref&gt;Purcell, "Electricity and Magnetism, 3rd Edition," p 546: Ch 11 Section 6, "Electron Spin and Magnetic Moment."&lt;/ref&gt;

==Classical electrodynamics==
{{Main article|Classical electrodynamics}}

In 1600, [[ William Gilbert (astronomer)|William Gilbert]] proposed, in his ''[[De Magnete]]'', that electricity and magnetism, while both capable of causing attraction and repulsion of objects, were distinct effects. Mariners had noticed that lightning strikes had the ability to disturb a compass needle. The link between lightning and electricity was not confirmed until [[Benjamin Franklin]]'s proposed experiments in 1752.  One of the first to discover and publish a link between man-made electric current and magnetism was [[Romagnosi]], who in 1802 noticed that connecting a wire across a [[voltaic pile]] deflected a nearby [[compass]] needle. However, the effect did not become widely known until 1820, when Ørsted performed a similar experiment.&lt;ref name='Oersted'&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www-istp.gsfc.nasa.gov/Education/whmfield.html |title=Magnetic Fields -- History |accessdate=2009-11-27 |last=Stern |first=Dr. David P. |first2=Mauricio |last2=Peredo |date=2001-11-25 |publisher=NASA Goddard Space Flight Center }}&lt;/ref&gt; Ørsted's work influenced Ampère to produce a theory of electromagnetism that set the subject on a mathematical foundation.

A theory of electromagnetism, known as [[classical electromagnetism]], was developed by various physicists during the period between 1820 and 1873 when it culminated in the publication of a [[A Treatise on Electricity and Magnetism|treatise]] by [[James Clerk Maxwell]], which unified the preceding developments into a single theory and discovered the electromagnetic nature of light.&lt;ref&gt;Purcell, p 436. Chapter 9.3, "Maxwell's description of the electromagnetic field was essentially complete."&lt;/ref&gt; In classical electromagnetism, the behavior of the electromagnetic field is described by a set of equations known as [[Maxwell's equations]], and the electromagnetic force is given by the [[Lorentz force|Lorentz force law]].&lt;ref&gt;Purcell: p 278: Chapter 6.1, "Definition of the Magnetic Field." Lorentz force and force equation.&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the peculiarities of classical electromagnetism is that it is difficult to reconcile with [[classical mechanics]], but it is compatible with special relativity. According to Maxwell's equations, the [[speed of light]] in a vacuum is a universal constant that is dependent only on the [[Permittivity|electrical permittivity]] and [[magnetic permeability]] of [[free space]]. This violates [[Galilean invariance]], a long-standing cornerstone of classical mechanics. One way to reconcile the two theories (electromagnetism and classical mechanics) is to assume the existence of a [[luminiferous aether]] through which the light propagates. However, subsequent experimental efforts failed to detect the presence of the aether. After important contributions of [[Hendrik Lorentz]] and [[Henri Poincaré]], in 1905, [[Albert Einstein]] solved the problem with the introduction of special relativity, which replaced classical kinematics with a new theory of kinematics compatible with classical electromagnetism. (For more information, see [[History of special relativity]].)

In addition, relativity theory implies that in moving frames of reference, a magnetic field transforms to a field with a nonzero electric component and conversely, a moving electric field transforms to a nonzero magnetic component, thus firmly showing that the phenomena are two sides of the same coin. Hence the term "electromagnetism". (For more information, see [[Classical electromagnetism and special relativity]] and [[Covariant formulation of classical electromagnetism]].)

==Extension to nonlinear phenomena==
[[File:Sun in X-Ray.png|thumb|300px|[[Magnetic reconnection]] in the solar [[Plasma (physics)|plasma]] gives rise to [[solar flare]]s, a complex magnetohydrodynamical phenomenon.]]
The Maxwell equations are ''linear,'' in that a change in the sources (the charges and currents) results in a proportional change of the fields. [[Nonlinear system|Nonlinear dynamics]] can occur when electromagnetic fields couple to matter that follows nonlinear dynamical laws. This is studied, for example, in the subject of [[magnetohydrodynamics]], which combines Maxwell theory with the [[Navier–Stokes equations]].

==Quantities and units==
{{see also|List of physical quantities|List of electromagnetism equations}}
'''Electromagnetic units''' are part of a system of electrical units based primarily upon the magnetic properties of electric currents, the fundamental SI unit being the ampere. The units are:
{{Div col}}
*[[ampere]] (electric current)
*[[coulomb]] (electric charge)
*[[farad]] (capacitance)
*[[henry (unit)|henry]] (inductance)
*[[ohm]] (resistance)
*[[siemens (unit)|siemens]] (conductance)
*[[tesla (unit)|tesla]] (magnetic flux density)
*[[volt]] (electric potential)
*[[watt]] (power)
*[[weber (unit)|weber]] (magnetic flux)
{{Div col end}}
In the electromagnetic [[Centimetre gram second system of units|cgs]] system, electric current is a fundamental quantity defined via [[Ampère's law]] and takes the [[Permeability (electromagnetism)|permeability]] as a dimensionless quantity (relative permeability) whose value in a vacuum is unity. As a consequence, the square of the speed of light appears explicitly in some of the equations interrelating quantities in this system.

{{SI electromagnetism units}}

Formulas for physical laws of electromagnetism (such as [[Maxwell's equations]]) need to be adjusted depending on what system of units one uses. This is because there is no [[one-to-one correspondence]] between electromagnetic units in SI and those in CGS, as is the case for mechanical units. Furthermore, within CGS, there are several plausible choices of electromagnetic units, leading to different unit "sub-systems", including [[Gaussian units|Gaussian]], "ESU", "EMU", and [[Heaviside–Lorentz]]. Among these choices, Gaussian units are the most common today, and in fact the phrase "CGS units" is often used to refer specifically to [[Gaussian units|CGS-Gaussian units]].

'''Error catastrophe''' is the extinction of an [[organism]] (often in the context of [[microorganism]]s such as [[viruses]]) as a result of excessive mutations.  Error catastrophe is something predicted in mathematical models and has also been observed empirically.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| pmid=15649564 | doi=10.1016/j.virusres.2004.11.008 | volume=107 | title=Action of mutagenic agents and antiviral inhibitors on foot-and-mouth disease virus | year=2005 | journal=Virus Res | pages=183–93 | last1 = Pariente | first1 = N | last2 = Sierra | first2 = S | last3 = Airaksinen | first3 = A}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Like every organism, viruses 'make mistakes' (or [[mutate]]) during replication.  The resulting mutations increase [[biodiversity]] among the population and help subvert the ability of a host's immune system to recognise it in a subsequent infection. The more mutations the virus makes during replication, the more likely it is to avoid recognition by the immune system and the more diverse its population will be (see the article on [[biodiversity]] for an explanation of the selective advantages of this). However, if it makes too many mutations, it may lose some of its biological features which have evolved to its advantage, including its ability to reproduce at all.

The question arises: ''how many mutations can be made during each replication before the population of viruses begins to lose self-identity?''

==Basic mathematical model==
Consider a virus which has a genetic identity modeled by a string of ones and zeros (e.g. 11010001011101....). Suppose that the string has fixed length ''L'' and that during replication the virus copies each digit one by one, making a mistake with probability ''q'' independently of all other digits.

Due to the mutations resulting from erroneous replication, there exist up to ''2&lt;sup&gt;L&lt;/sup&gt;'' distinct strains derived from the parent virus. Let ''x&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'' denote the concentration of strain ''i''; let ''a&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'' denote the rate at which strain ''i'' reproduces; and let ''Q&lt;sub&gt;ij&lt;/sub&gt;'' denote the probability of a virus of strain ''i'' mutating to strain ''j''.

Then the rate of change of concentration ''x&lt;sub&gt;j&lt;/sub&gt;'' is given by

:&lt;math&gt;\dot{x}_j = \sum_i a_i Q_{ij} x_i&lt;/math&gt;

At this point, we make a mathematical idealisation: we pick the fittest strain (the one with the greatest reproduction rate ''a&lt;sub&gt;j&lt;/sub&gt;'') and assume that it is unique (i.e. that the chosen ''a&lt;sub&gt;j&lt;/sub&gt;'' satisfies ''a&lt;sub&gt;j&lt;/sub&gt; &gt; a&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'' for all ''i''); and we then group the remaining strains into a single group. Let the concentrations of the two groups be ''x , y'' with reproduction rates ''a&gt;b'', respectively; let ''Q'' be the probability of a virus in the first  group (''x'') mutating to a member of the second group (''y'') and let ''R'' be the probability of a member of the second group returning to the first (via an unlikely and very specific mutation). The equations governing the development of the populations are:

:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{cases}
\dot{x} = &amp; a(1-Q)x + bRy \\
\dot{y} = &amp; aQx + b(1-R)y \\
\end{cases}
&lt;/math&gt;

We are particularly interested in the case where ''L'' is very large, so we may safely neglect ''R'' and instead consider:

:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{cases}
\dot{x} = &amp; a(1-Q)x \\
\dot{y} = &amp; aQx + by \\
\end{cases}
&lt;/math&gt;

Then setting ''z = x/y'' we have

:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{matrix}
\frac{\partial z}{\partial t} &amp; = &amp; \frac{\dot{x} y - x \dot{y}}{y^2} \\
&amp;&amp; \\
&amp; = &amp; \frac{a(1-Q)xy - x (aQx + by)}{y^2} \\
&amp;&amp; \\
&amp; = &amp; a(1-Q)z - (aQz^2 +bz) \\
&amp;&amp; \\
&amp; = &amp; z(a(1-Q) -aQz -b) \\
\end{matrix}
&lt;/math&gt;.

Assuming ''z'' achieves a steady concentration over time, ''z'' settles down to satisfy

:&lt;math&gt; z(\infty) = \frac{a(1-Q)-b}{aQ} &lt;/math&gt;

(which is deduced by setting the derivative of ''z'' with respect to time to zero).

So the important question is ''under what parameter values does the original population persist (continue to exist)?'' The population persists if and only if the steady state value of ''z'' is strictly positive. i.e. if and only if:

:&lt;math&gt; z(\infty) &gt; 0 \iff a(1-Q)-b &gt;0 \iff (1-Q) &gt; b/a .&lt;/math&gt;

This result is more popularly expressed in terms of the ratio of ''a:b'' and the error rate ''q'' of individual digits: set ''b/a = (1-s)'', then the condition becomes

:&lt;math&gt; z(\infty) &gt; 0 \iff (1-Q) = (1-q)^L &gt; 1-s &lt;/math&gt;

Taking a logarithm on both sides and approximating for small ''q'' and ''s'' one gets

:&lt;math&gt;L \ln{(1-q)} \approx -Lq &gt; \ln{(1-s)} \approx -s&lt;/math&gt;

reducing the condition to:

:&lt;math&gt; Lq &lt; s &lt;/math&gt;

[[RNA viruses]] which replicate close to the error threshold have a genome size of order 10&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt; (10000) [[base pairs]].  Human [[DNA]] is about ''3.3'' billion (10&lt;sup&gt;9&lt;/sup&gt;) base units long. This means that the replication mechanism for human DNA must be [[orders of magnitude]] more accurate than for the RNA of RNA viruses.

===Information-theory based presentation===

To avoid error catastrophe, the amount of information lost through mutation must be less than the amount gained through natural selection. This fact can be used to arrive at essentially the same equations as the more common differential presentation.&lt;ref&gt;M. Barbieri, ''The Organic Codes'', p. 140&lt;/ref&gt;

The information lost can be quantified as the genome length ''L'' times the replication error rate ''q''. The probability of survival, ''S'', determines the amount of information contributed by natural selection— and [[information]] is the negative log of probability. Therefore, a genome can only survive unchanged when

:&lt;math&gt; Lq &lt; -\ln{S}&lt;/math&gt;

For example, the very simple genome where ''L = 1'' and ''q = 1'' is a genome with one bit which always mutates. Since ''Lq'' is then 1, it follows that S has to be ½ or less. This corresponds to half the offspring surviving; namely the half with the correct genome.

==Applications of the theory==
Some viruses such as [[polio]] or [[hepatitis C]] operate very close to the critical mutation rate (i.e. the largest ''q'' that ''L'' will allow). Drugs have been created to increase the mutation rate of the viruses in order to push them over the critical boundary so that they lose self-identity.  However, given the criticism of the basic assumption of the mathematical model, this approach is problematic.

&lt;!-- If someone more knowledgeable than I would expand on all of this then that would be great --&gt;
The result introduces a [[Catch-22 (logic)|Catch-22]] mystery for biologists, [[Eigen's paradox]]: in general, large genomes are required for accurate replication (high replication rates are achieved by the help of [[enzymes]]), but a large genome requires a high accuracy rate ''q'' to persist. Which comes first and how does it happen? An illustration of the difficulty involved is ''L'' can only be 100 if ''q''' is 0.99 - a very small string length in terms of genes.{{cn|date=July 2018}}

'''[[Forensics|Forensic]] audio enhancement''' is the scientific analysis and improvement of audio clarity, typically to improve intelligibility.

Although the term is "enhancement", the process is almost entirely composed of [[Filter (signal processing)|filtering]] away unwanted sounds in order to leave a more understandable version.


==Admissibility as evidence==
* The processes applied must adhere to the [[Federal Rules of Evidence|standards of evidence]] and so it is admissible in a [[court of law]]. The audio expert must be able to document the steps they took, these steps must be replicable, no data can be created, and no judgment based edits or deletions can occur. Changes in pitch or speed can also render a recording inadmissible.
* The courts may require proper [[chain of custody]] documentation with this evidence. This includes appropriate precautions to ensure that the evidence is properly protected and stored.
* If the enhancement is performed using commercially available software, proof of vendor specified training and proficiency may be required.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7689">'''François Thibaut''' (born January 3, 1948) is an educator known for developing the ''Thibaut Technique'' [[second language acquisition]] method for children and is the Founder/Director of ''The Language Workshop for Children'' (“LWFC”)He currently operates nationwide educational centers based in New York City.&lt;ref name="talklikeny"&gt;{{cite web| title = To Talk Like New York, Sign Up for Spanish| author = Qjito, Mirta | publisher = [[The New York Times]]| date = 1999-10-18|url = https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9801E1DA1739F93BA25753C1A96F958260&amp;sec=&amp;spon=&amp;&amp;scp=4&amp;sq=francois%20thibaut&amp;st=cse}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thibaut’s technique is the basis of the curriculum offered at LWFC programs and in the [[Professor Toto]] children’s language education animation. The LWFC begins teaching languages to children at the age of six months, when they’re preverbal.&lt;ref name="blngualbaby"/&gt;[[Image:Thibaut.jpg|frame|right|Francois Thibaut at the Language Workshop For Children]]

==Childhood Observations, The Basis of the Thibaut Technique==
At the age of six Thibaut was enrolled at the [[Collège Sainte-Barbe|College Saint Barbe boarding school in Paris]] where teachers intentionally made little to no effort to translate or explain the meaning of the French language curriculum in which newly arriving, non-French speaking students found themselves immersed. Instead, after six weeks of absorbing French in a context-rich language immersion classroom, the non-French elementary age children would begin speaking French in single words. Then by week eight they were speaking in two, and then three word sentences.  Eventually, by 2½ months they were constructing complete, accent-free French sentences, correctly attributing noun genders, and using past, present, and future tenses.  Years later Thibaut realized that he’d observed a strong example of what neurolinguist [[Eric Lenneberg]] later identified in his book Biological Foundations of Language (1967) what he termed the [[critical period]] in language development. Thibaut’s childhood observations eventually led him to bring immersive, emotionally stimulating, context-rich, language classes founding his Cercle Franco Americain (later Language Workshop for Children) classes in New York, NY in the early 1970s. Thus, the Thibaut Technique was introduced into American culture.&lt;ref name="blngualbaby"&gt;{{cite web| title = Bilingual Babies, A Sign of the Times| author = Sreenivasan, Hari | publisher = [[Nightline (US news program)|ABC Nightline]]| date = 2007-01-30|url = https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9801E1DA1739F93BA25753C1A96F958260&amp;sec=&amp;spon=&amp;&amp;scp=4&amp;sq=francois%20thibaut&amp;st=cse}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="superbaby"&gt;{{cite web| title = The Super Baby Burnout Syndrome| author = Elder, Janet | publisher = [[The New York Times]]| date = 1980-01-08|url = https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=940DE4D71539F93BA35752C0A96F948260&amp;sec=&amp;spon=&amp;pagewanted=3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This approach has often been attributed to baby language enrichment products first introduced for VCR’s in the mid-1990s. While many of these brands have had more national exposure, Thibaut’s technique was in existence for more than 20 years prior to their debut.

==Early Teaching Experience==
Thibaut emigrated to [[New York City]]  in 1973, when foreign language instruction was strongly focused on high school and college students. As a teacher he was frustrated by watching his college-age students continually struggle the same drill and translation-based French so he began focusing on younger learners, abandoned translation-drills, and adopted the context-rich, language acquisition devices that he observed at his own elementary school in the 1950s, adding his own brand of playfulness, color, and humor.

==The Language Workshop for Children==
Since 1973, his internationally recognized Language Workshop for Children has offered stimulating language lessons for babies, toddlers and elementary grades. Original music, vocabulary-building songs, language immersion, festive visual aids, action games and native-fluent language teachers are why the LWFC is the country’s leader in children’s language educational play. As Thibaut says, “Children remember the words that make them happy”.

==The French Language Salon==
In 2011, Thibaut drew on his successful technique with children by offering friendly, situationally relevant classes through his French Language Salon® classes for adults. Thibaut’s new adult method immediately integrates grammar and conversation, rather than teaching them as separate disciplines. Thibaut’s former child students often attend his adult classes to practice French for social and professional purposes. Thibaut also designed a test preparation program for students of varying levels who are working to pass in exams focused on French as a second language and comply with the [[Common European Framework of Reference for Languages]].

Thibaut specializes in different types of test preparation that merge his original French teaching style with patterns that correlating to the pertaining exam (SAT, AP French, CEFRL, and Canadian TEF.)  He combines his French education experience with an understanding of the exams and their tendencies, inspired by the, “life-hack,” movement and applied to a more academic and professional sphere.

==Technology==
With the growth of technology at the turn of the new century, Thibaut expanded his outreach platforms beyond the classroom by producing his [[Professor Toto]] Language Education Series for children, available in original CD/DVD and downloadable formats through Amazon, as well as making his language lessons and test prep services available via Skype.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10131">'''Genetic epidemiology''' is the study of the role of [[genetics|genetic]] factors in determining health and disease in families and in populations, and the interplay of such genetic factors with environmental factors. Genetic epidemiology seeks to derive a statistical and quantitative analysis of how genetics work in large groups.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title = Fundamentals of Genetic Epidemiology|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=VC7BAgAAQBAJ|publisher = Oxford University Press|date = 1993-01-01|isbn = 9780195052886|language = en|first = Muin J.|last = Khoury|first2 = Terri H.|last2 = Beaty|first3 = Bernice H.|last3 = Cohen}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Definition ==
The use of the term ''Genetic epidemiology'' emerged in the mid 1980s as a new scientific field.

In formal language, genetic epidemiology was defined by [[Newton Morton]], one of the pioneers of the field, as "a science which deals with the [[etiology]], distribution, and control of disease in groups of relatives and with inherited causes of disease in populations".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last=Morton |first= N. E. |date=1982 | title=Outline of Genetic Epidemiology |publisher=Karger| location= New York| isbn=3-8055-2269-X }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is closely allied to both [[molecular epidemiology]] and [[statistical genetics]], but these overlapping fields each have distinct emphases, societies and journals.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

One definition of the field closely follows that of [[Behavioural genetics|behavior genetics]], defining genetic epidemiology as "the scientific discipline that deals with the analysis of the familial distribution of traits, with a view to understanding any possible genetic basis", and that "seeks to understand both the genetic and environmental factors and how they interact to produce various diseases and traits in humans".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Genetic Epidemiology Defined|url = http://www.biostat.wustl.edu/gems/definition.shtml|website = www.biostat.wustl.edu|access-date = 2016-02-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[BMJ: British Medical Journal|BMJ]] adopts a similar definition, "Genetic epidemiology is the study of the aetiology, distribution, and control of disease in groups of relatives and of inherited causes of disease in populations."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Genetic epidemiology|url = http://www.bmj.com/content/320/7244/1257|journal = BMJ|date = 2000-05-06|issn = 0959-8138|pmid = 10797040|pages = 1257–1259|volume = 320|issue = 7244|doi = 10.1136/bmj.320.7244.1257|language = en|first = Jaakko|last = Kaprio|pmc=1117994}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
As early as the 4th century BC, [[Hippocrates]] suggested in his essay “On Airs, Waters, and Places” that factors such as behavior and environment may play a role in disease. Epidemiology entered a more systematic phase with the work of [[John Graunt]], who in 1662 tried to quantify mortality in London using a statistical approach, tabulating various factors he thought played a role in mortality rates. [[John Snow (physician)|John Snow]] is considered to be the father of epidemiology, and was the first to use statistics to discover and target the cause of disease, specifically of cholera outbreaks in 1854 in London. He investigated the cases of cholera and plotted them onto a map  identifying the most likely cause of cholera, which was shown to be contaminated water wells.

=== Modern history ===
Modern genetics began on the foundation of [[Gregor Mendel]]'s work. Once this became widely known, it  spurred a revolution in studies of hereditary throughout the animal kingdom; with studies showing genetic transmission and control over characteristics and traits. As gene variation was shown to affect disease, work began on quantifying factors affecting disease, accelerating in the 20th century. The period since the second world war saw the greatest advancement of the field, with scientists such as [[Newton Morton]] helping form the field of genetic epidemiology as it is known today, with the application of modern genetics to the statistical study of disease, as well as the establishment of large-scale epidemiological studies such as the [[Framingham Heart Study]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Principles of Epidemiology in Public Health Practice - An Introduction to Applied Epidemiology and Biostatistics|last = |first = |publisher = U.S. DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES|year = 2006|isbn = |location = |pages = 1, 7–12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1960s and 1970s, epidemiology played a part in strategies for the worldwide eradication of naturally occurring smallpox.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Epidemiology in the Global Eradication of Smallpox|url = http://ije.oxfordjournals.org/content/1/1/25|journal = International Journal of Epidemiology|date = 1972-03-20|issn = 0300-5771|pmid = 4669176|pages = 25–30|volume = 1|issue = 1|doi = 10.1093/ije/1.1.25|language = en|first = D. A.|last = Henderson}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Fundamentals ==
Traditionally, the study of the role of genetics in disease progresses through the following study designs, each answering a slightly different question:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.dorak.info/epi/genetepi.html |title=Introduction to Genetic Epidemiology | author= M. Tevfik Dorak | date=2008-03-03| accessdate=2008-03-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* [[Familial aggregation]] studies: Is there a genetic component to the disease, and what are the relative contributions of genes and environment?
* [[Genetic segregation|Segregation]] studies: What is the [[dominance relationship|pattern of inheritance]] of the disease (e.g. dominant or recessive)?
* [[Genetic linkage|Linkage]] studies: On which part of which [[chromosome]] is the disease gene located?
* [[Genetic association|Association]] studies: Which [[allele]] of which gene is associated with the disease?

This traditional approach has proved highly successful in identifying [[monogenic disorder]]s and locating the genes responsible.

More recently, the scope of genetic epidemiology has expanded to include common diseases for which many genes each make a smaller contribution ([[polygenic disorder|polygenic]], [[multifactorial or multigenic disorder]]s). This has developed rapidly in the first decade of the 21st century following completion of the [[Human Genome Project]], as advances in [[genotyping]] technology and associated reductions in cost has made it feasible to conduct large-scale [[genome-wide association study|genome-wide association studies]] that genotype many thousands of [[single nucleotide polymorphism]]s in thousands of individuals. These have led to the discovery of many [[genetic polymorphism]]s that influence the risk of developing many common diseases.

== Approaches ==
Genetic epidemiological research follows 3 discreet steps, as outlined by M.Tevfik Dorak''':'''
# Establishing that there is a genetic component to the disorder.
# Establishing the relative size of that genetic effect in relation to other sources of variation in disease risk (environmental effects such as intrauterine environment, physical and chemical effects as well as behavioral and social aspects).
# Identifying the gene(s) responsible for the genetic component.
These research methodologies can be assessed through either family or population studies.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = INTRODUCTION TO GENETIC EPIDEMIOLOGY [M.Tevfik DORAK]|url = http://www.dorak.info/epi/genetepi.html|website = www.dorak.info|access-date = 2016-02-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first case can be a result of [[tensile strength|tensile]] (pulling) forces, [[compressive strength|compressive]] (pushing) forces, [[Simple shear|shear]], [[bending]] or [[Torsion (mechanics)|torsion]] (twisting).

In the second case, the most significant factor, which is determined by the temperature, is the mobility of the structural defects such as grain boundaries, point vacancies, line and screw dislocations, stacking faults and twins in both crystalline and non-crystalline solids. The movement or displacement of such mobile defects is thermally activated, and thus limited by the rate of atomic diffusion.&lt;ref name="Dav"&gt;Davidge, R.W.

Media having this common property may be termed ''dispersive media''. Sometimes the term '''''chromatic'' dispersion''' is used for specificity.
Although the term is used in the field of optics to describe [[light]] and other [[electromagnetic wave]]s, dispersion in the same sense can apply to any sort of wave motion such as [[acoustic dispersion]] in the case of sound and seismic waves, in [[gravity wave]]s (ocean waves), and for telecommunication signals along [[transmission line]]s (such as [[coaxial cable]]) or [[optical fiber]].}}

The '''ISRO Propulsion Complex''' ('''IPRC'''), located at [[Mahendragiri]] of [[Tamil Nadu]], is an [[Indian Space Research Organisation]] centre involved in testing, assembling, and integrating propulsion systems and stages that are developed at ISRO's [[Liquid Propulsion Systems Centre]]s. Formerly, IPRC was known as LPSC, Mahendragiri, functioning under [[Liquid Propulsion Systems Centre|LPSC]], Valiamala in [[Thiruvananthapuram]] of [[Kerala]]. It was elevated as an independent centre and renamed as IPRC with effect from February 1, 2014.&lt;ref name="ISRO"&gt;http://www.isro.gov.in/isrocentres/iprc.aspx&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/lpsc-at-mahendragiri-elevated/article5641468.ece&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2014-02-01/science/46897203_1_mahendragiri-vikram-sarabhai-space-centre-gslv&lt;/ref&gt;

It is one of the ISRO centres that could be called as the "Jet Propulsion Laboratory of India" as all liquid, [[cryogenic]] and [[semicryogenic]] stage and engine related tests of ISRO's launch vehicles and satellites are carried out here.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.business-standard.com/article/pti-stories/lpsc-mahendragiri-to-function-as-independent-unit-minister-114013100771_1.html&lt;/ref&gt;.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="35582">[[File:Teatersport -4.jpg|thumb|Swedish actors performing in [[theatresports]], a competitive form of improv]]
'''Improvisational theatre''', often called '''provisation ''' or '''improv''', is the form of [[theatre]], often [[comedy]], in which most or all of what is performed is unplanned or unscripted: created spontaneously by the performers. In its purest form, the dialogue, action, story, and characters are created collaboratively by the players as the improvisation unfolds in present time, without use of an already prepared, written [[Play (theatre)|script]].

Improvisational theatre exists in performance as a range of styles of improvisational comedy as well as some non-comedic theatrical performances. It is sometimes used in film and television, both to develop characters and scripts and occasionally as part of the final product.

Improvisational techniques are often used extensively in drama programs to train actors for stage, film, and television and can be an important part of the rehearsal process. However, the skills and processes of improvisation are also used outside the context of performing arts - [[Applied improvisation|Applied Improvisation]]. It is used in classrooms as an educational tool and in businesses as a way to develop communication skills, creative problem solving, and supportive team-work abilities that are used by improvisational, ensemble players&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hainselin|first=Mathieu|last2=Aubry|first2=Alexandre|last3=Bourdin|first3=Béatrice|date=2018|title=Improving Teenagers’ Divergent Thinking With Improvisational Theater|url=https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2018.01759/full|journal=Frontiers in Psychology|language=English|volume=9|doi=10.3389/fpsyg.2018.01759|issn=1664-1078}}&lt;/ref&gt;. It is sometimes used in [[psychotherapy]] as a tool to gain insight into a person's thoughts, feelings, and relationships.

==History==
The earliest well documented use of improvisational theatre in Western history is found in the [[Atellan Farce]] of 391 BC. From the 16th to the 18th centuries, ''[[commedia dell'arte]]'' performers improvised based on a broad outline in the streets of Italy. In the 1890s, theatrical theorists and directors such as the Russian [[Konstantin Stanislavski]] and the French [[Jacques Copeau]], founders of two major streams of acting theory, both heavily utilized improvisation in acting training and rehearsal.&lt;ref&gt;''Twentieth Century Acting Training''. ed. Alison Hodge. New York: Routledge, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Modern===
[[File:Dario Fo in Venice Film Festival 02.jpg|thumb|Italian Nobel-winner [[Dario Fo]] received international acclaim for his highly improvisational style]]
Modern theatrical improvisation games began as drama exercises for children, which were a staple of drama education in the early 20th century thanks in part to the [[progressive education]] movement initiated by [[John Dewey]] in 1916.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.interactiveimprov.com/tspwb1hist.html|title=TheatreSports History|work=interactiveimprov.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some people credit American [[Dudley Riggs]] as the first [[vaudeville|vaudevillian]] to use audience suggestions to create improvised sketches on stage. Improvisation exercises were developed further by [[Viola Spolin]] in the 1940s, 50s, and 60s, and codified in her book ''Improvisation For The Theater'',&lt;ref name="Spolin"&gt;{{cite book|title=Improvisation for the Theater Third Edition|author=Viola Spolin|year=1999|ISBN=0-8101-4008-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; the first book that gave specific techniques for learning to do and teach improvisational theater. In the 1970s in Canada, British playwright and director [[Keith Johnstone]] wrote ''[[Impro: Improvisation and the Theatre]]'', a book outlining his ideas on improvisation, and invented [[Theatresports]], which has become a staple of modern improvisational comedy and is the inspiration for the popular television show ''[[Whose Line Is It Anyway? (U.S. TV series)|Whose Line Is It Anyway?]]''

Spolin influenced the first generation of modern American improvisers at [[The Compass Players]] in [[Chicago]], which led to [[The Second City]]. Her son, [[Paul Sills]], along with [[David Shepherd (producer)|David Shepherd]], started The Compass Players. Following the demise of the Compass Players, Paul Sills began The Second City. They were the first organized troupes in Chicago, and the modern Chicago improvisational comedy movement grew from their success.&lt;ref name=Wonderful&gt;The story of the Compass Players and its development into The Second City is told by first-hand interviews in Jeffrey Sweet's book "Something Wonderful Right Away" (Limelight Editions, 2004)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Compass&gt;Janet Coleman's "The Compass: The Improvisational Theatre that Revolutionized American Comedy" (Centennial Publications of The University of Chicago Press, 1991).&lt;/ref&gt;

Many of the current "rules" of comedic improv were first formalized in Chicago in the late 1950s and early 1960s, initially among The Compass Players troupe, which was directed by Paul Sills. From most accounts, David Shepherd provided the philosophical vision of the Compass Players, while [[Elaine May]] was central to the development of the premises for its improvisations. [[Mike Nichols]], Ted Flicker, and [[Del Close]] were her most frequent collaborators in this regard. When The Second City opened its doors on December 16, 1959, directed by Paul Sills, his mother Viola Spolin began training new improvisers through a series of classes and exercises which became the cornerstone of modern improv training. By the mid-1960s, Viola Spolin's classes were handed over to her protégé, [[Josephine Forsberg|Jo Forsberg]], who further developed Spolin's methods into a one-year course, which eventually became [[The Players Workshop]], the first official school of improvisation in the USA. During this time, Forsberg trained many of the performers who went on to star on The Second City stage.&lt;ref name=Wonderful /&gt;&lt;ref name=Compass /&gt;

Many of the original cast of ''[[Saturday Night Live]]'' came from The Second City, and the franchise has produced such comedy stars as [[Mike Myers (actor)|Mike Myers]], [[Tina Fey]], [[Bob Odenkirk]], [[Amy Sedaris]], [[Stephen Colbert]], [[Eugene Levy]], [[Jack McBrayer]], [[Steve Carell]], [[Chris Farley]], [[Dan Aykroyd]], and [[John Belushi]].

Simultaneously, Keith Johnstone's group The Theatre Machine, which originated in [[London]], was touring Europe. This work gave birth to [[Theatresports]], at first secretly in Johnstone's workshops, and eventually in public when he moved to Canada. [[Toronto]] has been home to a rich improv tradition.

In 1984, [[Dick Chudnow]] (Kentucky Fried Theater) founded [[ComedySportz]] in [[Milwaukee]], WI. Expansion began with the addition of ComedySportz-Madison (WI), in 1985. The first Comedy League of America National Tournament was held in 1988, with 10 teams participating. The league is now known as CSz Worldwide and boasts a roster of 29 international cities.

In San Francisco, [[The Committee (improv group)|The Committee]] theater was active in North Beach during the 1960s. It was founded by alumni of Chicago's Second City, [[Alan Myerson]] and his wife Jessica. When The Committee disbanded in 1972, three major companies were formed: The Pitchell Players, The Wing, and Improvisation Inc. The only company that continued to perform Close's [[Harold (improvisation)|Harold]] was the latter one. Its two former members, Michael Bossier and John Elk, formed Spaghetti Jam in San Francisco's [[Old Spaghetti Factory]] in 1976, where shortform improv and Harolds were performed through 1983. Stand-up comedians performing down the street at the [[Intersection for the Arts]] would drop by and sit in. In 1979, Elk brought shortform to England, teaching workshops at [[Jacksons Lane]] Theatre, and he was the first American to perform at [[The Comedy Store, London]], above a Soho strip club.

Modern political improvisation's roots include [[Jerzy Grotowski]]'s work in Poland during the late 1950s and early 1960s, [[Peter Brook]]'s "happenings" in England during the late 1960s, [[Augusto Boal]]'s "Forum Theatre" in South America in the early 1970s, and San Francisco's [[Diggers (theater)|The Diggers]]' work in the 1960s. Some of this work led to pure improvisational performance styles, while others simply added to the theatrical vocabulary and were, on the whole, [[avant-garde]] experiments.

[[Joan Littlewood]], an English actress and director who was active from the 1930s to 1970s, made extensive use of improv in developing plays for performance. However, she was successfully prosecuted twice for allowing her actors to improvise in performance. Until 1968, British law required scripts to be approved by the [[Lord Chamberlain's Office]]. The department also sent inspectors to some performances to check that the approved script was performed exactly as approved.

In 1987, [[Annoyance Theatre]] began as a club in Chicago that emphasizes longform improvisation. The Annoyance Theatre has grown into multiple locations in Chicago and New York City. It is the home of the longest running musical improv show in history at 11 years.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://theannoyance.com/about-the-annoyance/history-of-the-annoyance/|title=History of the Annoyance {{!}} The Annoyance Theatre &amp; Bar|website=theannoyance.com|language=en-US|access-date=2018-10-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In 2012, Lebanese writer and director [[Lucien Bourjeily]] used improvisational theater techniques to create a multi-sensory play entitled ''66 Minutes in Damascus''. This play premiered at the London International Festival of Theater, and is considered one of the most extreme kinds of interactive improvised theater put on stage. The audience play the part of kidnapped tourists in today's Syria in a hyperreal sensory environment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://exeuntmagazine.com/reviews/66-minutes-in-damascus/|title=Review of 66 Minutes in Damascus at Shoreditch Town Hall - Exeunt Magazine|author=Lois Jeary|work=exeuntmagazine.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Rob Wittig and Mark C. Marino have developed a form of improv for online theatrical improvisation called [[netprov]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dichtung-digital.de/en/journal/aktuelle-nummer/?postID=577|title=Current Issue - Dichtung Digital|work=dichtung-digital.de}}&lt;/ref&gt; The form relies on [[social media]] to engage audiences in the creation of dynamic fictional scenarios that evolve in real-time.

==Improvisational comedy==
[[File:Improvisers in Chicago.jpeg|thumb|Three improvisers performing longform improv comedy at the Gorilla Tango Theatre in Chicago.]]
Modern improvisational comedy, as it is practiced in the West, falls generally into two categories: shortform and longform.

Shortform improv consists of short scenes usually constructed from a predetermined [[Theater game|game]], structure, or idea and driven by an audience suggestion. Many shortform exercises were first created by Viola Spolin, who called them theater games, influenced by her training from recreational games expert [[Neva Boyd]].&lt;ref name="Spolin"/&gt; The shortform improv comedy television series ''[[Whose Line Is It Anyway? (disambiguation)|Whose Line Is It Anyway?]]'' has familiarized American and British viewers with shortform.

Longform improv performers create shows in which short scenes are often interrelated by story, characters, or themes. Longform shows may take the form of an existing type of theatre, for example a full-length play or [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]]-style [[musical theater|musical]] such as [[Spontaneous Broadway]]. One of the better-known longform structures is [[Harold (improvisation)|the Harold]], developed by [[IO Theater|ImprovOlympic]] co-founder [[Del Close]]. Many such longform structures now exist. Longform improvisation is especially performed in [[Chicago]], [[New York City]], [[Los Angeles]]; has a strong presence in [[Austin]], [[Boston]], [[Minneapolis]], [[Phoenix, Arizona|Phoenix]], [[Philadelphia]], [[San Francisco]], [[Seattle]], [[Detroit]], [[Toronto]], [[Vancouver]], [[Washington, D.C.]]; and is building a growing following in [[Denver]], [[Montreal]], [[Kansas City, Missouri|Kansas City]], [[Columbus, Ohio|Columbus]], [[New Orleans]], [[Omaha]], [[Rochester, NY|Rochester]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://rochesterhomepage.net/fulltext?nxd_id=351262 |title=Fall Back Comedy Festival this weekend |accessdate=2015-01-29 |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121103093553/http://rochesterhomepage.net/fulltext?nxd_id=351262 |archivedate=November 3, 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Hawaii]]. Outside the [[United States]], longform improv has a growing presence in the [[United Kingdom]], especially in cities such as [[London]],&lt;ref&gt;[[List of improvisational theatre companies]]{{Better source|reason=per WP:CIRCULAR|date=May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Bristol]], and at the [[Edinburgh Festival Fringe]].

==Non-comedic, experimental, and dramatic, narrative-based improvisational theater==
Other forms of improvisational theatre training and performance techniques are [[Experimental theatre|experimental]] and avant-garde&lt;ref&gt;Experimental Theatre from Stanislavsky to Peter Brook by James Roose Evans&lt;/ref&gt; in nature and not necessarily intended to be [[comedy|comedic]]. These include [[Playback Theatre]] and [[Theatre of the Oppressed]], the [[Jerzy Grotowski|Poor Theatre]], [[the Open Theatre]], to name only a few.

[[The Open Theatre]] was founded in New York City by a group of former students of acting teacher [[Nola Chilton]], and joined shortly thereafter by director [[Joseph Chaikin]], formerly of [[The Living Theatre]], and Peter Feldman. This avante-garde theatre group explored political, artistic, and social issues. The company, developing work through an improvisational process drawn from Chilton and [[Viola Spolin]], created well-known exercises, such as "sound and movement" and "transformations", and originated radical forms and techniques that anticipated or were contemporaneous with [[Jerzy Grotowski]]'s "[[poor theater]]" in Poland.[1]{{clarify|date=October 2016|reason="[1]"? Was someone trying to make a citation there?}} During the sixties Chaikin and the Open Theatre developed full theatrical productions with nothing but the actors, a few chairs and a bare stage, creating character, time and place through a series of transformations the actors physicalized and discovered through improvisations.

Longform, dramatic, and narrative-based improvisation is well-established on the west coast with companies such as San Francisco's [[BATS Improv]]. This format allows for full-length plays and musicals to be created improvisationally.

==Applying improv principles in life==
Many people who have studied improv have noted that the guiding principles of improv are useful, not just on stage, but in everyday life.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/embracing-the-dark-side/200908/everything-i-need-know-i-learned-improv|title=Everything I Need to Know, I Learned from Improv|work=Psychology Today}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, [[Stephen Colbert]] in a commencement address said,&lt;ref&gt;Stephen Colbert 2006 Commencement Address at Knox College [http://departments.knox.edu/newsarchive/news_events/2006/x12547.html Transcript]&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|Well, you are about to start the greatest improvisation of all. With no script. No idea what's going to happen, often with people and places you have never seen before. And you are not in control. So say "yes." And if you're lucky, you'll find people who will say "yes" back.}}

[[Tina Fey]] in her book ''[[Bossypants]]'' lists several rules of improv that apply in the workplace.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.women2.org/tina-feys-rules-for-improv-and-your-career/ |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120109232959/http://www.women2.org/tina-feys-rules-for-improv-and-your-career/ |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2012-01-09 |title=Tina Fey's Rules For Improv… And Your Career |work=Women 2.0 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; There has been much interest in bringing lessons from improv into the corporate world. In a New York Times article titled [https://www.nytimes.com/2008/03/02/business/02unbox.html "Can Executives Learn to Ignore the Script?"], Stanford professor and author, Patricia Ryan Madson notes, "executives and engineers and people in transition are looking for support in saying yes to their own voice. Often, the systems we put in place to keep us secure are keeping us from our more creative selves."

==In film and television==
{{refimprove section|date=February 2012}}
Many directors have made use of improvisation in the creation of both mainstream and experimental films. Many [[silent film]]makers such as [[Charlie Chaplin]] and [[Buster Keaton]] used improvisation in the making of their films, developing their gags while filming and altering the [[Plot (narrative)|plot]] to fit. The [[Marx Brothers]] were notorious for deviating from the script they were given, their [[ad lib]]s often becoming part of the standard routine and making their way into their films. Many people, however, make a distinction between ad-libbing and improvising.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://forum.wordreference.com/threads/improvise-v-ad-lib.2495051/|title=improvise v. ad-lib|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The British director [[Mike Leigh]] makes extensive use of improvisation in the creation of his films, including improvising important moments in the characters' lives that will not even appear in the film. ''[[This Is Spinal Tap]]'' and other [[mockumentary]] films of director [[Christopher Guest]] are created with a mix of scripted and unscripted material and ''[[Blue in the Face]]'' is a 1995 comedy directed by Wayne Wang and Paul Auster created in part by the improvisations during the filming of ''[[Smoke (film)|Smoke]]''.

Some of the best known American film directors who are noted for their use of improvisation in their work with actors are [[John Cassavetes]], [[Robert Altman]], [[Christopher Guest]] and [[Rob Reiner]].

Improv comedy techniques have also been used in television and [[Stand-up comedian|stand-up comedy]] in hit shows such as [[HBO|HBO's]] television show ''[[Curb Your Enthusiasm]]'' created by [[Larry David]], the UK Channel 4 and ABC television series ''[[Whose Line Is It Anyway? (U.S. TV series)|Whose Line Is It Anyway]]'' (and its spinoffs ''[[Drew Carey's Green Screen Show]]'' and ''[[Drew Carey's Improv-A-Ganza]]''), Nick Cannon's improv comedy show ''[[Wild 'N Out]]'', and ''[[Thank God You're Here]]''. In Canada, the series ''[[Train 48]]'' was improvised from scripts which contained a minimal outline of each scene, and the comedy series ''[[This Sitcom Is...Not to Be Repeated]]'' incorporated dialogue drawn from a hat during the course of an episode. The American show ''Reno 911!'' also contained improvised dialogue based on a plot outline. ''[[Fast and Loose (TV series)|Fast and Loose]]'' is an improvisational game show, much like ''Whose Line Is It Anyway?''. The BBC sitcoms ''[[Outnumbered (UK TV series)|Outnumbered]]''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/2008/dec/06/television-bbc|title=BBC sitcom lets kids improvise|author=Ben Dowell|work=the Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt; and ''[[The Thick of It]]''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/tv/features/the-thick-of-it-back-in-the-loop-1805589.html|title=The Thick of It: Back in the loop|work=The Independent}}&lt;/ref&gt; also had some improvised elements in them.

==Psychology==
In the field of the psychology of [[consciousness]], Eberhard Scheiffele explored the altered state of consciousness experienced by actors and improvisers in his scholarly paper ''Acting: an altered state of consciousness''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Scheiffele |first1=Eberhard |journal=Research in Drama Education: The Journal of Applied Theatre and Performance |title=an altered state of consciousness |date=2001 |volume= 6 |issue=2 |url=http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/13569780120070722#preview |doi=10.1080/13569780120070722 |pages=179–191}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to G. William Farthing in ''The Psychology of Consciousness'' comparative study, actors routinely enter into an altered state of consciousness (ASC).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://sci-con.org/2004/12/levels-of-consciousness/ |title=Levels of Consciousness |work=sci-con.org }}&lt;/ref&gt; Acting is seen as altering most of the 14 dimensions of changed subjective experience which characterize ASCs according to Farthing, namely: attention, perception, imagery and fantasy, inner speech, memory, higher-level thought processes, meaning or significance of experiences, time experience, emotional feeling and expression, level of arousal, self-control, suggestibility, body image, and sense of personal identity.

In the growing field of [[Drama Therapy]], [[psychodrama]]tic improvisation, along with other techniques developed for [[Drama Therapy]], are used extensively. The ''[[Yes, and...|"Yes, and"]]'' rule has been compared to [[Milton Erickson]]'s ''utilization'' process and to a variety of acceptance-based psychotherapies. Improv training has been recommended for [[couples therapy]] and therapist training, and it has been speculated that improv training may be helpful in some cases of [[social anxiety disorder]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sfxmachine.com/docs/yes,_and.pdf|title=Yes, and: Acceptance, Resistance, and Change in Improv, Aikido, and Psychotherapy|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p05xcvc2|title=BBC World Service - People Fixing The World, Improvising Your Way Out of Anxiety|last=|first=|date=|website=[[BBC]]|language=en-GB|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-11-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Structure and process==
Improvisational theatre often allows an interactive relationship with the audience. Improv groups frequently solicit suggestions from the audience as a source of inspiration, a way of getting the audience involved, and as a means of proving that the performance is not scripted. That charge is sometimes aimed at the masters of the art, whose performances can seem so detailed that viewers may suspect the scenes are planned.

In order for an improvised [[scene (fiction)|scene]] to be successful, the improvisers involved must work together responsively to define the parameters and action of the scene, in a process of [[co-creation]]. With each spoken word or action in the scene, an improviser makes an ''offer'', meaning that he or she defines some element of the reality of the scene. This might include giving another character a name, identifying a relationship, location, or using [[Mime artist|mime]] to define the physical environment. These activities are also known as ''endowment''. It is the responsibility of the other improvisers to accept the offers that their fellow performers make; to not do so is known as blocking, negation, or denial, which usually prevents the scene from developing. Some performers may deliberately block (or otherwise break out of character) for comedic effect—this is known as ''gagging''—but this generally prevents the scene from advancing and is frowned upon by many improvisers. Accepting an offer is usually accompanied by adding a new offer, often building on the earlier one; this is a process improvisers refer to as ''[[Yes, and...|"Yes, And..."]]'' and is considered the cornerstone of improvisational technique. Every new piece of information added helps the improvisers to refine their characters and progress the action of the scene. The ''"Yes, And..."'' rule, however, applies to a scene's early stage since it is in this stage that a "base (or shared) reality" is established in order to be later redefined by applying the ''"if (this is true), then (what else can also be true)"'' practice progressing the scene into comedy, as explained in the 2013 manual by the ''[[Upright Citizens Brigade]]'' members.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2014/02/23/arts/upright-citizens-brigade-writes-its-book-on-improv.html?_r=0 Get the Laughs, but Follow the Rules], ''[[The New York Times]]'', 20 February 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

The unscripted nature of improv also implies no predetermined knowledge about the [[Theatrical property|props]] that might be useful in a scene. Improv companies may have at their disposal some number of readily accessible props that can be called upon at a moment's notice, but many improvisers eschew props in favor of the infinite possibilities available through [[mime artist|mime]]. In improv, this is more commonly known as 'space object work' or 'space work', not 'mime', and the props and locations created by this technique, as 'space objects' created out of 'space substance,' developed as a technique by Viola Spolin.&lt;ref name="Spolin"/&gt; As with all improv ''offers'', improvisers are encouraged to respect the validity and [[Continuity (fiction)|continuity]] of the imaginary environment defined by themselves and their fellow performers; this means, for example, taking care not to walk through the table or "miraculously" survive multiple bullet wounds from another improviser's gun.

Because improvisers may be required to play a variety of roles without preparation, they need to be able to construct characters quickly with physicality, [[gesture]]s, [[Accent (sociolinguistics)|accents]], [[human voice|voice]] changes, or other techniques as demanded by the situation. The improviser may be called upon to play a character of a different age or sex. Character motivations are an important part of successful improv scenes, and improvisers must therefore attempt to act according to the objectives that they believe their character seeks.

==Community==
Many theatre troupes are devoted to staging improvisational performances and growing the improv community through their training centers.

In addition to for-profit theatre troupes, there are many college-based improv groups in the United States and around the world.

In Europe the special contribution to the theatre of the abstract, the surreal, the irrational and the subconscious have been part of the stage tradition for centuries. From the 1990s onwards a growing number of European [[Improv groups]] have been set up specifically to explore the possibilities offered by the use of the abstract in improvised performance, including dance, movement, sound, music, mask work, lighting, and so on. These groups are not especially interested in comedy, either as a technique or as an effect, but rather in expanding the improv genre so as to incorporate techniques and approaches that have long been a legitimate part of European theatre.

==Notable Contributors To The Field==
Some key figures in the development of improvisational theatre are [[Viola Spolin]] and her son [[Paul Sills]], founder of Chicago's famed [[The Second City|Second City]] troupe and originator of [[Theater Games]], and [[Del Close]], founder of [[ImprovOlympic]] (along with [[Charna Halpern]]) and creator of a popular longform improv format known as [[The Harold]]. Other luminaries include [[Keith Johnstone]], the British teacher and writer–author of ''[[Impro]]'', who founded the Theatre Machine and whose teachings form the foundation of the popular shortform [[Theatresports]] format, [[Dick Chudnow]], founder of [[ComedySportz]] which evolved its family-friendly show format from Johnstone's Theatersports, and Bill Johnson, creator/director of [https://web.archive.org/web/20071115124528/http://magicmeathands.com/ The Magic Meathands], who pioneered the concept of "Commun-edy Outreach" by tailoring performances to non-traditional audiences, such as the homeless and foster children.

[[David Shepherd (producer)|David Shepherd]], with Paul Sills, founded [[The Compass Players]] in Chicago. Shepherd was intent on developing a true "people's Theatre", and hoped to bring political drama to the stockyards. The Compass went on to play in numerous forms and companies, in a number of cities including NY and Hyannis, after the founding of The Second City. A number of Compass members were also founding members of The Second City. In the 1970s, Shepherd began experimenting with group-created videos. He is the author of "That Movie In Your Head", about these efforts. In the 1970s, David Shepherd and Howard Jerome created the Improvisational Olympics, a format for competition based improv. The Improv Olympics were first demonstrated at Toronto's Homemade Theatre in 1976 and have been continued on as the [[Canadian Improv Games]]. In the United States, the Improv Olympics were later produced by Charna Halpern under the name "ImprovOlympic" and now as "IO"; IO operates training centers and theaters in Chicago and Los Angeles. At IO, Halpern combined Shepherd's "Time Dash" game with Del Close's "Harold" game; the revised format for the Harold became the fundamental structure for the development of modern longform improvisation.&lt;ref&gt;An account of this process which lead up to the development of modern longform improvisation, as seen through first-person accounts of Shepherd and Halpern, can be found in the following documentary film: {{cite AV media |people=Mike Fly |date= |year=2010 |title=David Shepherd: A Lifetime in Improvisational Theatre |trans-title= |medium= |language= |url=https://www.youtube.com/embed/t5wgtkgCH3A |access-date= |format= |time= |location= |publisher= |id= |isbn= |oclc= |quote= |ref= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1975 Jonathan Fox founded [[Playback Theatre]], a form of improvised community theatre which is often not comedic and replays stories as shared by members of the audience.

[[The Groundlings]] is a popular and influential improv theatre and training center in [[Los Angeles]], California. [[Gary Austin]], founder of The Groundlings, continues to teach improvisation around the country, focusing especially in Los Angeles. He is widely acclaimed as one of the greatest acting teachers in America. His work is grounded in the lessons he learned as an improviser at The Committee with Del Close, as well as in his experiences as founding director of The Groundlings. The Groundlings is often seen as the Los Angeles training ground for the "second generation" of improv luminaries and troupes. Stan Wells developed the "Clap-In" style of longform improvisation here, later using this as the basis for his own theatre, The Empty Stage which in turn bred multiple troupes utilizing this style.

In the late 1990s, [[Matt Besser]], [[Amy Poehler]], [[Ian Roberts (American actor)|Ian Roberts]], and [[Matt Walsh (comedian)|Matt Walsh]] founded the [[Upright Citizens Brigade Theatre]] in New York and later they founded one in Los Angeles, each with an accompanying improv/sketch comedy school. In September 2011 the UCB opened a third theatre in New York City's East Village, known as UCBeast.

Gunter Lösel compared the existing improvisational theater theories (from Moreno, Spolin, Johnstone, Close...), structured them and wrote a general theory of improvisational theater.&lt;ref&gt;''Das Spiel mit dem Chaos - Zur Performativität des Improvisationstheaters''. Gunter Lösel. Bielefeld: transcript Verlag, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Inspector America''''' is a television series produced by Original Productions and distributed and shown on [[History (U.S. TV channel)|History Channel]]. The show premiered on April 17, 2011.

''Inspector America'' is hosted by [[Timothy Galarnyk]], an [[Safety engineering|infrastructure safety]] specialist.  Each week, Galarnyk travels to a different U.S. city to inspect the current state of the city's infrastructure, including bridges, tunnels, utilities, and other public works. Timothy frequently interviews citizens of that city, such as the people that survived the Minnesota Bridge Collapse. He reports what he finds to the city, sometimes by taking the officials with him.

}}'''ICBA''' (International Center for Biosaline Agriculture) is an international, non-profit agricultural research and development center which focuses on the closely linked issues of water, environment, income, and [[food security]]. ICBA conducts research and development programs that aim to improve agricultural productivity and sustainability in marginal environments.

Its headquarters are in [[Dubai]], [[United Arab Emirates]] and it is a founding member of the [[Association of International Research and Development Centers for Agriculture]] (AIRCA).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.airca.org/index.php/airca-members|title=AIRCA Members|website=www.airca.org|access-date=2016-04-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is also a member of Middle East and North Africa Network of Water Centers of Excellence&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://menanwc.org/about-network/current-members/international-center-biosaline-agriculture-icba|title=International Center for Biosaline Agriculture (ICBA)|website=Middle East and North Africa Network of Water Centers of Excellence|access-date=2016-04-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the Asia-Pacific Association of Agricultural Research Institutions (APAARI).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.apaari.org/about/members/|title=Members : APAARI|website=Asia Pacific Association of Agricultural Research Institutions|access-date=2016-04-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==

In 1992, the [[Islamic Development Bank]] (IDB) initiated a series of expert consultations which outlined the objectives and activities of the new institute. In November 1992, the IDB Board of Executive Directors approved financing for start-up operations. Subsequent consultations between the Bank and the General Secretariat of the [[Gulf Cooperation Council]] led to the selection of the United Arab Emirates as a host country for the new center.

In 1996, the IDB and the Government of the UAE signed an agreement to establish ICBA as a formal entity. In 1997, the Municipality of Dubai donated 100 hectares of land at Al Ruwayyah, where ICBA's head office is now based. The center became operational in 1999.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.springer.com/gp/book/9783319057675|title=Environmental Cost and Face of Agriculture in the Gulf Cooperation Council Countries|last=Shahid|first=Shabbir A.|last2=Ahmed|first2=Mushtaque|publisher=Springer International Publishing|year=2014|isbn=978-3-319-05768-2|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Funding ==

ICBA’s founding donors were the Islamic Development Bank (IDB), the [[OPEC Fund for International Development]] (OFID), the [[Arab Fund for Economic and Social Development]] (AFESD), and the [[Politics of the United Arab Emirates|Government of the United Arab Emirates]] (UAE).

Currently the Center is funded by the three core donors: the Ministry of Climate Change and Environment of the UAE (formerly the Ministry of Environment and Water); the Environment Agency - Abu Dhabi; and the Islamic Development Bank. The Center has additional support from several development agencies and international donors such as&amp;nbsp;the [[International Fund for Agricultural Development]] (IFAD), the [[International Atomic Energy Agency]] (IAEA), the UAE Government, Dubai and Abu Dhabi Municipalities, and the private sector in Oman and Saudi Arabia.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/9780470290187.ch16/summary|title=The Role of Biosaline Agriculture in Managing Freshwater Shortages and Improving Water Security|last=Al-Attar|first=Mohammad|date=2003|publisher=Iowa State Press|isbn=9780470290187|editor-last=Scanes|editor-first=Colin G.|pages=271–280|language=en|doi=10.1002/9780470290187.ch16|editor-last2=Miranowski|editor-first2=John A.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Inayatullah|first=Sohail|last2=Elouafi|first2=Ismahane A.|date=2014|title=The alternative futures of the International Centre for Biosaline Agriculture: from salinity research to greening the desert|url=http://www.emeraldinsight.com/doi/abs/10.1108/FS-08-2013-0030|journal=Foresight|volume=16|issue=5|pages=389–409|doi=10.1108/FS-08-2013-0030|issn=1463-6689}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Research and development focus ==
[[file:Ismahane Elouafi (cropped).jpg|thumb|Dr Ismahane Elouafiis the center's director (2015)]]
Initially ICBA focused solely on biosaline environments but its applied research for development now aims to address agricultural challenges in all marginal environments.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Its tasks include assessment of natural resources, [[Adaptation to global warming|climate change adaptation]], [[Agricultural productivity|crop productivity]] and diversification, [[aquaculture]], [[bioenergy]] and policy analysis.

ICBA works on a number of technological developments, including the use of conventional and non-conventional water (such as saline, [[Wastewater|treated wastewater]], [[Industrial water treatment|industrial water]], [[agricultural drainage]], and seawater);&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.zawya.com/story/Scientists_finding_ways_to_help_farmers_maximise_ground_water-GN_29032015_300309/|title=Scientists finding ways to help farmers maximise ground water|last=Ponce de Leon|first=Janice|date=29 March 2015|website=Thomson Reuters ZAWYA|access-date=2016-04-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://muslim-science.com/icba-oasis-desert/|title=ICBA – An Oasis in the Desert|date=2 August 2014|website=Muslim Science|language=en-US|access-date=2016-04-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; water and land management technologies; and [[remote sensing]] and modeling for climate change adaptation.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The Center conducts research on a variety of food crops which hold promise of being resilient, salt tolerant and water efficient. For example, ICBA has been conducting widespread research on [[quinoa]], a multi-purpose, high-protein grain crop which is drought and salt tolerant. ICBA initiated research on a number of quinoa germplasm accessions since 2006–07. The selections from these trials are being introduced to farmers in several countries, e.g. in the United Arab Emirates in Abu Dhabi.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://raconteur.net/sustainability/more-meat-eaters-means-uk-farmers-can-cash-in|title=UK farming addresses global meat demand|last=Wale|first=Michael|date=29 July 2015|website=Raconteur|access-date=2016-04-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://icbawebsiteyn6lbe9b4h.devcloud.acquia-sites.com/sites/default/files/GulfTimes_quinoa_19072015.pdf|title=Proper value chain needed for Quinoa|last=Banerjee|first=Thirtho|date=19 July 2015|work=The Gulf Time|access-date=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

ICBA scientists are also working to increase the salinity tolerance of hardier traditional crops such as [[date palm]]s, [[sorghum]] and [[millet]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ozy.com/fast-forward/saltwater-saviors/30923|title=Saltwater Saviours|last=Cadei|first=Emily|date=15 April 2014|website=OZY|access-date=2016-04-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another field of research lies with ''[[Salicornia]]'' and other [[halophyte]]s (salt-loving plants) that remove salts from saline soils and water.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&amp;nbsp;''Salicornia’s'' oil-bearing seeds produce biofuel, cosmetic oil and edible vegetable oil. Its straws can also be used as animal fodder, and its vegetable tips can be harvested for human consumption.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://technologyreview.me/en/materials/salicornia-biofuel/|title=Why research won’t give up on Salicornia|last=Hashem|first=Heba|date=25 March 2015|website=MIT Technology Review|language=en-US|access-date=2016-04-04|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160414091919/http://technologyreview.me/en/materials/salicornia-biofuel/|archivedate=14 April 2016|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The geographic scope of ICBA has grown since its inception. It now focusses its work on water-scarce countries of the Middle East and North Africa (MENA) including Gulf Cooperation Council countries (GCC), Central Asia and the Caucasus (CAC) and South and Southwest Asia. It is currently expanding to include countries of sub-Saharan Africa (SSA).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-94-007-0519-7_3|title=Turning Adversity into an Advantage for Food Security Through Improving Soil Quality and Providing Production Systems for Marginal Saline Lands: ICBA Perspectives and Approach|last=Shahid|first=Shabbir A.|last2=Taha|first2=Faisal K.|last3=Ismail|first3=Shoaib|last4=Dakheel|first4=Abdullah|last5=Abdelfattah|first5=Mahmoud|date=2011|publisher=Springer Netherlands|isbn=9789400705180|editor-last=Behnassi|editor-first=Mohamed|pages=43–67|language=en|doi=10.1007/978-94-007-0519-7_3|editor-last2=Shahid|editor-first2=Shabbir A.|editor-last3=D'Silva|editor-first3=Joyce}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Isaac Dudley Fletcher''' (1844 – 1917) was a US businessman, art collector and museum benefactor.

He had the mansion built that is called today the [[Harry F. Sinclair House]]. He was president of Barrett Manufacturing Company and acquired a large art collection which he bequeathed to the [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]].&lt;ref name=MET&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.metmuseum.org/pubs/bulletins/1/pdf/3253700.pdf.bannered.pdf|format=PDF|title=1918 museum bulletin describing the bequeathed collection|website=Metmuseum.org|accessdate=2017-08-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the Frick library, he owned work by "David, Gainsborough, Rembrandt, Reynolds, and Rubens, Alexander H Wyant, Corot and Daubigny".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://research.frick.org/directoryweb/browserecord.php?-action=browse&amp;-recid=7443|title=Fletcher, Isaac Dudley, 1844-1917|website=Research.frick.org|accessdate=2017-08-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; The "work by David" referred to the ''[[Portrait of Charlotte du Val d'Ognes (Marie-Denise Villers)|Portrait of Charlotte du Val d'Ognes]]'', which at the time of the bequest in 1917 was still attributed to Jacques-Louis David, but since 1995 has been attributed to [[Marie-Denise Villers]].

Besides the collection itself, the bequest included a large sum of money to start a fund for the purchase of art. According to the 1994 Museum guidebook, several of the paintings listed were purchased through the ''Fletcher Fund'', most notably the ''[[Portrait of Juan de Pareja]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.nl/books?id=zoM2KmG_ndgC&amp;pg=PA169|title=The Metropolitan Museum of Art Guide|first1=Philippe De|last1=Montebello|date=28 August 1994|publisher=Metropolitan Museum of Art|accessdate=28 August 2017|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Michael Oppenheimer''' (born February 28, 1946) is the Albert G. Milbank Professor of [[Geosciences]] and International Affairs in the [[Woodrow Wilson School of Public and International Affairs]] and the Department of Geosciences at [[Princeton University]]. He is the Director of the Program in Science,Technology and Environmental Policy (STEP) at the Woodrow Wilson School and Faculty Associate of the Atmospheric and Ocean Sciences Program, Princeton Environmental Institute, and the [[Princeton Institute for International and Regional Studies]].&lt;ref name=About&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.princeton.edu/step/people/faculty/michael-oppenheimer/|title=Michael Oppenheimer|author=Princenton University|accessdate= 14 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Oppenheimer has taken a leading role in various environmental and science policy related activities, with regard to [[acid rain]], and contributed to the 1990 amendments to the [[Clean Air Act (United States)|Clean Air Act]]. With regard to climate change, he was a major author of the [[IPCC Fourth Assessment Report]] and a lead author of the Fifth Assessment Report.

Oppenheimer is also a prominent public figure and has discussed the various aspects of global warming in the media. He has been a guest on many television and radio programs and talk shows, including ABC's ''[[This Week (ABC TV series)|This Week]]'', ''[[Nightline]]'', ''Alcove'', ''[[The News Hour]]'', ''[[The Oprah Winfrey Show]]'', ''[[Charlie Rose (TV series)|Charlie Rose]]'', ''[[ABC News]]'' and ''[[The Colbert Report]]''. Oppenheimer is the author of over 140 articles published in professional journals.

He is the author of ''Dead Heat: The Race Against The Greenhouse Effect'', written together with environmental activist Robert H. Boyle and published in 1990. Oppenheimer is co-founder of the [[Climate Action Network]].

== Background ==
Oppenheimer (born February 28, 1946 in NYC) joined the Princeton faculty after more than two decades with The [[Environmental Defense Fund]] (EDF), a non-governmental, environmental organization, where he served as chief scientist and manager of the Climate and Air Program.  
Prior to his position at The Environmental Defense Fund, Dr. Oppenheimer served as Atomic and Molecular Astrophysicist at the [[Harvard–Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics]] and Lecturer on Astronomy at [[Harvard University]]. He received an S.B. in chemistry from [[M.I.T.]], a Ph.D. in chemical physics from the [[University of Chicago]], and pursued post-doctoral research at the Harvard–Smithsonian Center. He continues to serve as a science advisor to EDF.
Oppenheimer has been a member of several panels of the [[National Academy of Sciences]] and is now a member of the National Academies' Board on Energy and Environmental Systems. He is also a winner of the 2010 [[Heinz Award]] with special focus on global change&lt;ref name="The Heinz Awards"&gt;{{cite web|title=The Heinz Awards: Michael Oppenheimer|url=http://www.heinzawards.net/recipients/michael-oppenheimer|website=The Heinz Awards|publisher=The Heinz Awards|accessdate=August 26, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and a [[Fellow of the American Association for the Advancement of Science]].&lt;ref name=About /&gt;

== Research interests ==
His interests include science and policy of the atmosphere, particularly [[Effects of global warming|climate change and its impacts]]. Much of his research aims to understand the potential for "dangerous" outcomes of increasing levels of greenhouse gases by exploring the effects of global warming on ecosystems such as [[coral reefs]], on the [[ice sheets]] and [[sea level]], and on patterns of [[human migration]].&lt;ref name=About /&gt; He has assessed linkages among climate change, crop yields and Mexico–US cross-border migration.{{Citation needed|date=May 2015}} Oppenheimer studies the process of scientific learning and scientific assessments and their role in influencing public policies to respond to global change.{{Citation needed|date=May 2015}}

== Role in global science policy ==
Oppenheimer is a long-time participant in the [[Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change]] (IPCC) which won the [[Nobel Peace Prize in 2007]], serving recently as a lead author of the [[IPCC's Fourth Assessment Report]] and then as a coordinating lead author of the [[IPCC Fifth Assessment Report|Fifth Assessment Report]] as well as a Special Report on climate extremes and disasters. In the late 1980s, Dr. Oppenheimer and a handful of other scientists organized two workshops under the auspices of the [[United Nations]] that helped precipitate the negotiations that resulted in the [[United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change]] (signed at the [[1992 Earth Summit]]) and the [[Kyoto Protocol]]. During that period, he co-founded the [[Climate Action Network]]. His research and advocacy work on [[acid rain]] also contributed to the passage of the 1990 amendments to the [[Clean Air Act (United States)|Clean Air Act]].

=== Assessment of the IPCC process ===
In 2007, he wrote about limitations of the IPCC consensus approach in Science Magazine.&lt;ref name=MO&gt;{{cite journal | author = Oppenheimer Michael | year = 2007 | title = The limits of consensus", in ''Science Magazine's State of the Planet 2008-2009: with a Special Section on Energy and Sustainability'', Donald Kennedy, Island Press, 01.12.2008, separate as Michael Oppenheimer,  Brian C. O'Neill, Mort Webster, Shardul Agrawal, "CLIMATE CHANGE, The Limits of Consensus | url = | journal = [[Science (magazine)|Science]] | volume = 317 | issue = 5844| pages = 1505–06 | doi = 10.1126/science.1144831 |display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The current centralized assessment role of the IPCC allows for "communication in a monolithic message" but risks "ossification and eventual irrelevance" of the IPCC as an institution.&lt;ref name=yo/&gt; According to him, the ''problem of creating, defending and communicating consensus results as well as departures from the consensus'' had been discussed but not addressed until after the AR4.&lt;ref name=yo/&gt; Oppenheimer notes important recent major changes within the IPCC, including a stronger focus on uncertainty since the [[InterAcademy Panel]] IAC 2010 IPCC review and a focus upon risk management approaches based on fundamental conclusions in the AR4 Synthesis Report.&lt;ref name=yo/&gt; With regard to the IPCC double role as trying to communicate its results both to governments and to the general public, he sees the organization as not being entirely successful at either.&lt;ref name=yo/&gt; The IPCC needs, according to Oppenheimer et al., to decide whether it intends to communicate with  the general public at all.&lt;ref name=yo/&gt;

In 2011, together with [[Gary Yohe]], he published an essay, with a scope on the uncertainties in the IPCC assessments regarding e.g. [[climate sensitivity]] and a potential collapse of the [[West Antarctic Ice Sheet]], and about the similarly important evolution of socio-political-economic systems.&lt;ref name=yo&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1007/s10584-011-0176-8|journal=Climatic Change|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10584-011-0176-8/fulltext.html|title=Evaluation, characterization, and communication of uncertainty by the intergovernmental panel on climate change—an introductory essay|authors=Gary Yohe and Michael Oppenheimer|date=13 August 2011|volume=108|pages=629–639}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Together with Jessica O'Reilly and [[Naomi Oreskes]], Oppenheimer discussed the case of the
[[West Antarctic Ice Sheet]] assessment in IPCC reports in a [[Social Studies of Science]] paper 2012. The possible disastrous outcome of a disintegration of the WAIS for global sea levels was assessed in the [[IPCC Third Assessment Report]] but was barely addressed in the [[IPCC Fourth Assessment Report]]. IPCC authors were less confident about predictions of WAIS disintegration not only due to new science results published since the Third Assessment, but also due to reasons of internal "culture", such as changes of IPCC chairpersons, authors teams, and chapter organization made which it too difficult to project the range of possible futures for the WAIS as desired by governments.&lt;ref name=ore&gt;The Rapid Disintegration of Projections: The West Antarctic Ice Sheet and the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change Jessica O'Reilly, [[Naomi Oreskes]], Michael Oppenheimer Social Studies of Science June 26, 2012, {{DOI|10.1177/0306312712448130}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7251">'''Multimedia Studies''' is an interdisciplinary field of academic discourse focused on the understanding of technologies and cultural dimensions of linking traditional media sources with ones based on new media to support social systems.

==History==
Multimedia Studies as a discipline came out of the need for media studies to be made relevant to the new world of CD-ROMs and [[hypertext]] in the 1990s. Revolutionary books like Jakob Nielsen's 'Hypertext and Hypermedia' book lay the foundations for understanding multimedia alongside traditional cognitive science and interface design issues.&lt;ref&gt;Nielsen, J. (1990). Hypertext and Hypermedia. Saunders College Publishing/Harcourt Brace. {{ISBN|0125184107}}&lt;/ref&gt; Software like [[Adobe Authorware|Authorware Attain]], now owned by [[Adobe Systems|Adobe]], made the design of multimedia systems accessible to those unskilled in programming and became major applications by the end of the 1990s&lt;ref&gt;Schifman, R.S. (1999). The Ultimate Authorware Tutorial. Springer-Verlag. {{ISBN|3540641238}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Recent Challenges===
The Internet age that has been growing since the launch of [[Windows 98]] has brought new challenges for the discipline including developing new models and rules for the World Wide Web.

====Media Studies 2.0====
Some academics, such as [[David Gauntlett]], have preferred the neologism, 'Media Studies 2.0' to Multimedia Studies, in order to give it the feel of other fields like [[Web 2.0]] and Classroom 2.0.&lt;ref name="BFI"&gt;British Film Institute, [http://www.bfi.org.uk/education/conferences/mediastudies2007/ Media Studies Conference 2007] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071107113722/http://www.bfi.org.uk/education/conferences/mediastudies2007/ |date=2007-11-07 }}, 4–6 July 2007&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="TA"&gt;[http://www.transformingaudiences.org.uk Transforming Audiences International Conference], 6–7 September 2007&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="AR2"&gt;Andy Ruddock (2008), [http://www.blackwell-synergy.com/doi/pdf/10.1111/j.1751-9020.2007.00040.x 'Media Studies 2.0?

The Media Studies 2.0 neologism has received strong criticism. Andy Medhurst at Sussex University for instance wrote of the Media Studies 2.0 neologism introduced by David Gauntlett, 'Isn't it odd that whenever someone purportedly identifies a new paradigm, they see themselves as already a leading practitioner of it?'

'''Nutrition''' is the science that interprets the interaction of [[nutrients]] and other substances in [[food]] in relation to maintenance, growth, reproduction, [[health]] and disease of an organism. It includes food intake, [[Absorption (biology)|absorption]], [[Assimilation (biology)|assimilation]], [[biosynthesis]], [[catabolism]], and [[excretion]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nlm.nih.gov/pubs/cd_hum.nut.html#2|title=Joint Collection Development Policy: Human Nutrition and Food|publisher=US National Library of Medicine, National Institutes of Health|date=14 October 2014|accessdate=13 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Diet (nutrition)|diet]] of an organism is what it eats,  which is largely determined by the availability and [[palatability]] of foods. For humans, a [[healthy diet]] includes [[Food preparation|preparation of food]] and storage methods that preserve nutrients from oxidation, heat or leaching, and that reduce risk of [[foodborne illness]]es.

==History of human nutrition==

===Antiquity===
[[File:Hippocrates pushkin02.jpg|thumb|right|upright|alt=Stone sculpture of a man's head|[[Hippocrates]] lived about 400 BC, and Galen and the understanding of nutrition followed him for centuries.]]
The first recorded dietary advice, carved into a [[Babylon]]ian stone tablet in about 2500 BC, cautioned those with pain inside to avoid eating [[onion]]s for three days. [[Scurvy]], later found to be a [[vitamin C deficiency]], was first described in 1500 BC in the [[Ebers Papyrus]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Profession of Dietetics|author1=Payne-Palacio, June R.  |author2=Canter, Deborah D.|year=2014|publisher=Jones &amp; Bartlett Learning|isbn=978-1-284-02608-5|pages=3, 4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[Walter Gratzer]], the study of nutrition probably began during the 6th century BC. In China, the concept of ''[[qi]]'' developed, a spirit or "wind" similar to what Western Europeans later called ''[[pneuma]]''.&lt;ref name=Gratzer40&gt;Gratzer 2005, p. 40.&lt;/ref&gt; Food was classified into "hot" (for example, meats, blood, ginger, and hot spices) and "cold" (green vegetables) in China, India, Malaya, and Persia.&lt;ref name=Gratzer41 /&gt; ''[[Humorism|Humours]]'' developed perhaps first in China alongside ''qi''.&lt;ref name=Gratzer40 /&gt; Ho the Physician concluded that diseases are caused by deficiencies of elements ([[Wu Xing]]: fire, water, earth, wood, and metal), and he classified diseases as well as prescribed diets.&lt;ref name=Gratzer41&gt;Gratzer 2005, p. 41.&lt;/ref&gt; About the same time in Italy, [[Alcmaeon of Croton]] (a Greek) wrote of the importance of equilibrium between what goes in and what goes out, and warned that imbalance would result in disease marked by [[obesity]] or [[emaciation]].&lt;ref name=Gratzer36&gt;Gratzer 2005, p. 36.&lt;/ref&gt;

The first recorded nutritional experiment with human subjects is found in the Bible's [[Book of Daniel]]. Daniel and his friends were captured by the king of [[Babylon]] during an invasion of Israel. Selected as court servants, they were to share in the king's fine foods and wine. But they objected, preferring vegetables ([[Pulse (legume)|pulses]]) and water in accordance with their [[Jewish]] dietary restrictions. The king's chief steward reluctantly agreed to a trial. Daniel and his friends received their diet for ten days and were then compared to the king's men. Appearing healthier, they were allowed to continue with their diet.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=dan#en-NIV-21743 Daniel 1:5–16]. Biblegateway.com. Retrieved on 2011-10-17.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=McCollum, Elmer V.|title=A History of Nutrition|publisher=The Riverside Press (Houghton Mifflin)|location=Cambridge, Mass.|year=1957|pages=8–9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Around 475 BC, [[Anaxagoras]] stated that food is absorbed by the human body and, therefore, contains "homeomerics" (generative components), suggesting the existence of nutrients.&lt;ref name=history&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20060824032910/http://rcw.raiuniversity.edu/biotechnology/MScBioinformatics/generalnutrition/lecture-notes/lecture-01.pdf ''History of the Study of Nutrition in Western Culture''] (Rai University lecture notes for General Nutrition course, 2004)&lt;/ref&gt; Around 400 BC, [[Hippocrates]], who recognized and was concerned with obesity, which may have been common in southern Europe at the time,&lt;ref name=Gratzer36 /&gt; said, "Let food be your medicine and medicine be your food."&lt;ref name="Smith"&gt;{{cite journal | title=Let food by thy medicine… | author=Smith, Richard | journal=BMJ |date=24 January 2004| volume=328 | doi=10.1136/bmj.328.7433.0-g | pages=0–g | issue=7433| pmc=318470 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The works that are still attributed to him, ''[[Hippocratic Corpus|Corpus Hippocraticum]]'', called for [[moderation]] and emphasized [[Physical exercise|exercise]].&lt;ref name=Gratzer36 /&gt;

[[File:Galen detail.jpg|thumb|left|upright|alt=Shoulder high portrait of a man with beard and mustache wearing a cap|Followed for a millennium and a half, [[Galen]] (1st century) created the first coherent (although mistaken) theory of nutrition.&lt;ref name=Gratzer37&gt;Gratzer 2005, p. 37.&lt;/ref&gt;]]
[[Salt]], [[Black pepper|pepper]] and other spices were prescribed for various ailments in various preparations for example mixed with vinegar. In the 2nd century BC, [[Cato the Elder]] believed that [[cabbage]] (or the urine of cabbage-eaters) could cure digestive diseases, ulcers, warts, and intoxication. Living about the turn of the millennium, [[Celsus|Aulus Celsus]], an ancient Roman doctor, believed in "strong" and "weak" foods (bread for example was strong, as were older animals and vegetables).&lt;ref name=Gratzer37 /&gt;

===Galen to Lind===
One mustn't overlook the doctrines of [[Galen]]: In use from his life in the 1st century AD until the 17th century, it was [[heresy]] to disagree with him for 1500 years.&lt;ref name=Gratzer&gt;Gratzer 2005, pp. 38, 39, 41.&lt;/ref&gt; Galen was physician to gladiators in [[Pergamon]], and in [[Rome]], physician to [[Marcus Aurelius]] and the three emperors who succeeded him.&lt;ref name=Gratzer38&gt;Gratzer 2005, p. 38.&lt;/ref&gt; Most of Galen's teachings were gathered and enhanced in the late 11th century by [[Order of Saint Benedict|Benedictine monks]] at the [[Schola Medica Salernitana|School of Salerno]] in ''[[Regimen sanitatis Salernitanum]]'', which still had users in the 17th century.&lt;ref name=Gratzer39&gt;Gratzer 2005, p. 39.&lt;/ref&gt; Galen believed in the bodily ''humours'' of Hippocrates, and he taught that ''pneuma'' is the source of life. [[Classical element|Four elements]] (earth, air, fire and water) combine into "complexion", which combines into states (the [[four temperaments]]: sanguine, phlegmatic, choleric, and melancholic). The states are made up of pairs of attributes (hot and moist, cold and moist, hot and dry, and cold and dry), which are made of [[humorism|four humours]]: blood, phlegm, green (or yellow) bile, and black bile (the bodily form of the elements). Galen thought that for a person to have [[gout]], [[kidney stones]], or [[arthritis]] was scandalous, which Gratzer likens to Samuel Butler's ''[[Erehwon]]'' (1872) where sickness is a crime.&lt;ref name=Gratzer /&gt;
[[File:James lind.jpg|thumb|right|upright|alt=Waist high portrait drawn in pen and ink of a man balancing three books|[[James Lind]] conducted in 1747 the first controlled [[clinical trial]] in modern times, and in 1753 published ''Treatise on Scurvy''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|journal=Perspectives in Clinical Research|date=January–March 2010|pages=6–10|author=Bhatt, Arun|title=Evolution of Clinical Research: A History Before and Beyond James Lind|pmc=3149409|pmid=21829774|volume=1|issue=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
In the 1500s, [[Paracelsus]] was probably the first to criticize Galen publicly.&lt;ref name=Gratzer /&gt; Also in the 16th century, scientist and artist [[Leonardo da Vinci]] compared [[metabolism]] to a burning candle. Leonardo did not publish his works on this subject, but he was not afraid of thinking for himself and he definitely disagreed with Galen.&lt;ref name=Gratzer41 /&gt; Ultimately, 16th century works of [[Andreas Vesalius]], sometimes called the father of modern [[Outline of human anatomy|human anatomy]], overturned Galen's ideas.&lt;ref&gt;Gratzer 2005, p. 48.&lt;/ref&gt; He was followed by piercing thought amalgamated with the era's mysticism and religion sometimes fueled by the [[mechanics]] of Newton and Galileo. [[Jan Baptist van Helmont]], who discovered several [[gas]]es such as [[carbon dioxide]], performed the first [[quantitative research|quantitative experiment]]. [[Robert Boyle]] advanced [[chemistry]]. [[Sanctorius]] measured [[body weight]]. Physician [[Herman Boerhaave]] modeled the [[digestion|digestive process]]. Physiologist [[Albrecht von Haller]] worked out the difference between [[nerve]]s and [[muscle]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Gratzer 2005, pp. 48, 49, 50, 52, 53, 54.&lt;/ref&gt;

Sometimes forgotten during his life, [[James Lind]], a physician in the British navy, performed the first [[science|scientific]] nutrition experiment in 1747. Lind discovered that [[Lime (fruit)|lime]] juice saved sailors that had been at sea for years from [[scurvy]], a deadly and painful bleeding disorder. Between 1500 and 1800, an estimated two million sailors had died of scurvy.&lt;ref name=Willett-scurvy&gt;{{cite book|author=Willett, Walter C. with Skerrett, Patrick J.|title=Eat, Drink, and be Healthy: The Harvard Medical School Guide To Healthy Eating|year=2005|origyear=2001|isbn=978-0-684-86337-5|publisher=Free Press (Simon &amp; Schuster)|page=183}}&lt;/ref&gt; The discovery was ignored for forty years, after which British sailors became known as "limeys."&lt;ref&gt;Gratzer 2005, pp. 21–24, 32.&lt;/ref&gt; The essential [[vitamin C]] within citrus fruits would not be identified by scientists until 1932.&lt;ref name=Willett-scurvy /&gt;

===Lavoisier and modern science===
[[File:Lavoisier humanexp.jpg|alt=Black and white engraving of Lavoisier's laboratory, man seated at left with a tube attached to his mouth, man at center conducting experiment, woman seated at right drawing, other people visible|thumb|left|By containing his assistant, [[Armand Seguin]], inside a rubber suit fitted with a tube sealed to his mouth with putty, [[Antoine Lavoisier]] first measured [[basal metabolic rate]].&lt;ref&gt;Gratzer 2005, p. 60.&lt;/ref&gt; Drawing by [[Marie-Anne Pierrette Paulze|Madame Lavoisier]] (seated at right).]]
Around 1770, [[Antoine Lavoisier]] discovered the details of metabolism, demonstrating that the [[oxidation]] of food is the source of body heat. Called the most fundamental chemical discovery of the 18th century,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Silberberg, Martin S.|year=2009|title=Chemistry: The Molecular Nature of Matter and Change|publisher=McGraw-Hill|isbn=978-0-07-304859-8|edition=5|page=44}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lavoisier discovered the principle of [[conservation of mass]]. His ideas made the [[phlogiston theory]] of [[combustion]] obsolete.&lt;ref&gt;Gratzer 2005, p. 56.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1790, [[George Fordyce]] recognized [[calcium]] as necessary for the survival of fowl. In the early 19th century, the elements [[carbon]], [[nitrogen]], [[hydrogen]], and [[oxygen]] were recognized as the primary components of food, and methods to measure their proportions were developed.&lt;ref name="Paul Muljadi"&gt;{{cite book | url=https://books.google.com/?id=dpNGTccTTbEC&amp;pg=PA42 | title=Health | publisher=Paul Muljadi | author=Muljadi, Paul | pages=42}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1816, [[François Magendie]] discovered that dogs fed only [[carbohydrate]]s (sugar), [[fat]] (olive oil), and [[water]] died evidently of starvation, but dogs also fed protein survived, identifying [[protein]] as an essential dietary component.&lt;ref&gt;Gratzer 2005, pp. 73–74.&lt;/ref&gt; [[William Prout]] in 1827 was the first person to divide foods into carbohydrates, fat, and protein.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|journal=The Journal of Nutrition|title=William Prout (1785–1850):  A Biographical Sketch|author=Ahrens, Richard|date=January 1, 1977|volume=107|issue=1|page=15|url=http://jn.nutrition.org/content/107/1/15.full.pdf+html|format=PDF|doi=10.1093/jn/107.1.15}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the 19th century, [[Jean-Baptiste Dumas]] and [[Justus von Liebig]] quarrelled over their shared belief that animals get their protein directly from plants (animal and plant protein are the same and that humans do not create organic compounds).&lt;ref&gt;Gratzer 2005, p. 82.&lt;/ref&gt; With a reputation as the leading [[organic chemistry|organic chemist]] of his day but with no credentials in [[Physiology|animal physiology]],&lt;ref&gt;Carpenter 1994, p. 224.&lt;/ref&gt; Liebig grew rich making food [[extract]]s like beef [[Liebig's Extract of Meat Company|bouillon]] and [[infant formula]] that were later found to be of questionable nutritious value.&lt;ref&gt;Gratzer 2005, pp. 86, 92, 95, 115.&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1860s, [[Claude Bernard]] discovered that body fat can be synthesized from carbohydrate and protein, showing that the energy in blood [[glucose]] can be stored as fat or as [[glycogen]].&lt;ref&gt;Gratzer 2005, pp. 98–99.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Takaki_Kanehiro.jpg|thumb|right|upright|alt=Neck high portrait of middle aged man wearing a military uniform|[[Takaki Kanehiro]] surmised that [[beriberi]] was a nutritional deficiency not an infectious disease.]]
In the early 1880s, [[Kanehiro Takaki]] observed that Japanese sailors (whose diets consisted almost entirely of white rice) developed [[beriberi]] (or endemic neuritis, a disease causing heart problems and paralysis), but British sailors and Japanese naval officers did not. Adding various types of vegetables and meats to the diets of Japanese sailors prevented the disease, (not because of the increased protein as Takaki supposed but because it introduced a few parts per million of [[thiamine]] to the diet, later understood as a cure&lt;ref&gt;Carpenter 1994, p. 220.&lt;/ref&gt;).

In 1896, [[Eugen Baumann]] observed [[iodine]] in thyroid glands. In 1897, [[Christiaan Eijkman]] worked with natives of [[Java (island)|Java]], who also suffered from beriberi. Eijkman observed that chickens fed the native diet of white rice developed the symptoms of beriberi but remained healthy when fed unprocessed brown rice with the outer bran intact. His assistant, [[Gerrit Grijns]] correctly identified and described the anti-beriberi substance in rice. Eijkman cured the natives by feeding them brown rice, discovering that food can cure disease. Over two decades later, nutritionists learned that the outer rice bran contains vitamin B1, also known as [[thiamine]].

===From 1900 to the present===
[[File:Carl_von_Voit.jpg|thumb|right|upright|alt=Shoulder high portrait of white haired man with a mustache and beard wearing a suit and bow tie|[[Carl von Voit]] has been called the father of modern dietetics.]]
In the early 20th century, [[Carl von Voit]] and [[Max Rubner]] independently measured [[calorie|caloric]] energy expenditure in different species of animals, applying principles of physics in nutrition.  In 1906, Edith G.

&lt;div style="float:left;margin-right:1em;width:15em;"&gt;[[University of Oxford|Oxford University]] closed down its nutrition department after World War II because the subject seemed to have been completed between 1912 and 1944.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Carpenter, Kenneth J.|title=A Short History of Nutritional Science: Part 4 (1945–1985)|journal=The Journal of Nutrition|url=http://jn.nutrition.org/content/133/11/3331.long|date=November 1, 2003|volume=133|issue=11|pages=3331–3342|pmid=14608041|doi=10.1093/jn/133.11.3331}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
In 1912, [[Casimir Funk]] coined the term [[vitamin]], a vital factor in the diet, from the words "vital" and "amine," because these unknown substances preventing scurvy, beriberi, and [[pellagra]], were thought then to be derived from ammonia.  The vitamins were studied in the first half of the 20th century.

In 1913, [[Elmer McCollum]] and [[Marguerite Davis]] discovered the first vitamin, fat-soluble [[vitamin A]], then water-soluble [[vitamin B]] (in 1915; now known to be a complex of several water-soluble vitamins) and named [[vitamin C]] as the then-unknown substance preventing scurvy. [[Lafayette Mendel]] and [[Thomas Burr Osborne (chemist)|Thomas Osborne]] also performed pioneering work on vitamins A and B. In 1919, Sir [[Edward Mellanby]] incorrectly identified [[rickets]] as a vitamin A deficiency because he could cure it in dogs with cod liver oil.&lt;ref name=NAS-D&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nasonline.org/publications/beyond-discovery/vitamin-d.pdf|title=Unraveling the Enigma of Vitamin D|author1=Conlan, Roberta|author2=Elizabeth Sherman|year=October 2000|accessdate=June 13, 2016|publisher=National Academy of Sciences}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1922, McCollum destroyed the vitamin A in cod liver oil, but found that it still cured rickets.&lt;ref name=NAS-D /&gt;  Also in 1922, H.M. Evans and L.S. Bishop discover [[Tocopherol|vitamin E]] as essential for rat pregnancy, originally calling it "food factor X" until 1925.

In 1925, Hart discovered that trace amounts of [[copper]] are necessary for [[iron]] absorption.  In 1927, [[Adolf Otto Reinhold Windaus]] synthesized vitamin D, and was awarded the [[Nobel Prize]] in Chemistry in 1928. In 1928, [[Albert Szent-Györgyi]] isolated [[ascorbic acid]], and in 1932 proved that it is vitamin C by preventing scurvy. In 1935, he synthesized it, and in 1937, he won a Nobel Prize for his efforts. Szent-Györgyi concurrently elucidated much of the [[citric acid cycle]].

In the 1930s, [[William Cumming Rose]] identified [[essential amino acid]]s, necessary protein components that the body cannot synthesize.  In 1935, Underwood and Marston independently discovered the necessity of [[cobalt]].  In 1936, [[Eugene Floyd DuBois]] showed that work and school performance are related to caloric intake. In 1938, [[Erhard Fernholz]] discovered the chemical structure of vitamin E and then he tragically disappeared.&lt;ref name=NAS&gt;{{cite web|author=Subcommittee on Vitamin Tolerance, Committee on Animal Nutrition, National Research Council|title=Vitamin E, in Vitamin Tolerance of Animals|url=http://www.nap.edu/openbook.php?record_id=949&amp;page=23|year=1987|publisher= National Academy of Sciences|accessdate=December 22, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=F.B.I.

In 1940, [[rationing in the United Kingdom during and after World War II]] took place according to nutritional principles drawn up by [[Elsie Widdowson]] and others. In 1941, the first [[Recommended Dietary Allowance]]s (RDAs) were established by the [[United States National Research Council|National Research Council]].

In 1992, The U.S. Department of Agriculture introduced the [[Food Guide Pyramid]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cnpp.usda.gov/Publications/MyPyramid/OriginalFoodGuidePyramids/FGP/FGPPamphlet.pdf |publisher=United States Department Of Agriculture |title=USDA's Food Guide Pyramid Booklet, 1992 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140824061938/http://www.cnpp.usda.gov/Publications/MyPyramid/OriginalFoodGuidePyramids/FGP/FGPPamphlet.pdf |archivedate=August 24, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This replaced the [[Four Food Groups]] (1956-1992) and was superseded by the concept of [[MyPlate]] (2011–present).

==Nutrients==
{{Main|Nutrient}}
The list of nutrients that people are known to require is, in the words of [[Marion Nestle]], "almost certainly incomplete".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Nestle, Marion|authorlink=Marion Nestle|title=Food Politics: How the Food Industry Influences Nutrition and Health|publisher=University of California Press|page=413|isbn=978-0-520-27596-6|year=2013|origyear=2002}}&lt;/ref&gt; As of 2014, nutrients are thought to be of two types: [[macro-nutrient]]s which are needed in relatively large amounts, and [[micronutrient]]s which are needed in smaller quantities.&lt;ref name=Fuhrman /&gt; A type of carbohydrate, [[dietary fiber]], i.e. non-digestible material such as cellulose, is required,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.webmd.com/food-recipes/features/get-the-facts-on-fiber|title=Get the Facts on Fiber|website=webmd.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; for both mechanical and biochemical reasons, although the exact reasons remain unclear. Some nutrients can be stored - the fat-soluble vitamins - while others are required more or less continuously. Poor health can be caused by a lack of required nutrients, or for some vitamins and minerals, too much of a required nutrient.

===Macronutrients===
The macronutrients are [[carbohydrate]]s, [[dietary fiber|fiber]], [[fat]]s, [[protein]], and [[water]].&lt;ref name=Fuhrman /&gt;
The macronutrients (excluding fiber and water) provide structural material (amino acids from which proteins are built, and [[lipid]]s from which cell membranes and some signaling molecules are built) and [[Bioenergetics|energy]]. Some of the structural material can be used to generate energy internally, and in either case it is measured in [[Joule]]s or [[calorie|kilocalories]] (often called "Calories" and written with a capital ''C'' to distinguish them from little 'c' calories). Carbohydrates and proteins provide 17&amp;nbsp;kJ approximately (4&amp;nbsp;kcal) of energy per gram, while fats provide 37&amp;nbsp;kJ (9&amp;nbsp;kcal) per gram,&lt;ref name=Stryer&gt;{{cite book |vauthors=Berg J, Tymoczko JL, Stryer L | title = Biochemistry | publisher = W.H. Freeman | edition = 5th | location = San Francisco | year = 2002 | isbn = 978-0-7167-4684-3 |page= 603 }}&lt;/ref&gt; though the net energy from either depends on such factors as absorption and digestive effort, which vary substantially from instance to instance. Vitamins, minerals, fiber, and water do not provide energy, but are required for other reasons.

Molecules of carbohydrates and fats consist of carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen atoms. Carbohydrates range from simple [[monosaccharide]]s (glucose, fructose and galactose) to complex [[polysaccharide]]s (starch). Fats are [[triglyceride]]s, made of assorted [[fatty acid]] [[monomer]]s bound to a [[glycerol]] backbone. Some fatty acids, but not all, are [[Essential fatty acid|essential]] in the diet: they cannot be synthesized in the body. Protein molecules contain nitrogen atoms in addition to carbon, oxygen, and hydrogen. The fundamental components of protein are nitrogen-containing [[amino acid]]s, some of which are [[Essential amino acid|essential]] in the sense that humans cannot make them internally. Some of the amino acids are convertible (with the expenditure of energy) to glucose and can be used for energy production, just as ordinary glucose, in a process known as [[gluconeogenesis]]. By breaking down existing protein, the carbon skeleton of the various amino acids can be metabolized to intermediates in cellular respiration; the remaining ammonia is discarded primarily as urea in urine.

====Carbohydrates====
{{Main|Carbohydrate}}
Carbohydrates may be classified as [[monosaccharide]]s, [[disaccharide]]s, or [[polysaccharide]]s depending on the number of monomer (sugar) units they contain. They constitute a large part of foods such as [[rice]], [[noodle]]s, [[bread]], and other [[grain]]-based products, also [[potatoes]] , yams, beans, fruits, fruit juices and vegetables.
Monosaccharides, disaccharides, and polysaccharides contain one, two, and three or more sugar units, respectively. Polysaccharides are often referred to as ''complex'' carbohydrates because they are typically long, multiple branched chains of sugar units.

Traditionally, simple carbohydrates are believed to be absorbed quickly, and therefore to raise blood-glucose levels more rapidly than complex carbohydrates. This, however, is not accurate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Otto|first=H|title=Diabetik Bei Diabetus Mellitus|year=1973|publisher=Verlag Hans Huber|location=Bern}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Crapo|first=P|author2=Reaven, Olefsky |journal=Diabetes|year=1977|volume=26|pages=1178–1183|doi=10.2337/diabetes.26.12.1178|pmid=590639|title=Postprandial plasma-glucose and -insulin responses to different complex carbohydrates|issue=12}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Crapo|first=P |author2=Kolterman, Waldeck |author3=Reaven, Olefsky|journal=Am J Clin Nutr|year=1980|volume=33|pages=1723–1728|pmid=6996472|title=Postprandial hormonal responses to different types of complex carbohydrate in individuals with impaired glucose tolerance|issue=8|doi=10.1093/ajcn/33.8.1723 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Jenkins|first=David|author2=Jenkins, Alexandra L. |author3=Wolever, Thomas M.S. |author4= Thompson, Lilian H.  and Rao, A.

Diet, nutrition and the prevention of chronic diseases."] Report of a Joint WHO/FAO Expert Consultation; Geneva 2003. Retrieved 2011-03-07&lt;/ref&gt;

=====Fiber=====
{{Main|Dietary fiber}}
Dietary fiber is a carbohydrate that is incompletely absorbed in humans and in some animals. Like all carbohydrates, when it is metabolized it can produce four Calories (kilocalories) of energy per gram. However, in most circumstances it accounts for less than that because of its limited absorption and digestibility. Dietary fiber consists mainly of cellulose, a large carbohydrate polymer which is indigestible as humans do not have the required enzymes to disassemble it. There are two subcategories: soluble and insoluble fiber. Whole grains, fruits (especially [[plum]]s, [[prune]]s, and [[ficus|figs]]), and vegetables are good sources of dietary fiber. There are many health benefits of a high-fiber diet. Dietary fiber helps reduce the chance of gastrointestinal problems such as [[constipation]] and [[diarrhea]] by increasing the weight and size of stool and softening it. Insoluble fiber, found in [[whole wheat flour]], nuts and vegetables, especially stimulates [[peristalsis]];– the rhythmic muscular contractions of the intestines, which move digest along the digestive tract. Soluble fiber, found in oats, peas, beans, and many fruits, dissolves in water in the intestinal tract to produce a gel that slows the movement of food through the intestines. This may help lower blood glucose levels because it can slow the absorption of sugar. Additionally, fiber, perhaps especially that from whole grains, is thought to possibly help lessen insulin spikes, and therefore reduce the risk of [[type 2 diabetes]]. The link between increased fiber consumption and a decreased risk of colorectal cancer is still uncertain.

====Fat====
{{Main|Fat}}
A molecule of dietary fat typically consists of several [[fatty acid]]s (containing long chains of carbon and hydrogen atoms), bonded to a [[glycerol]]. They are typically found as [[triglyceride]]s (three fatty acids attached to one glycerol backbone). Fats may be classified as [[saturated fat|saturated]] or [[unsaturated fat|unsaturated]] depending on the detailed structure of the fatty acids involved. Saturated fats have all of the carbon atoms in their fatty acid chains bonded to hydrogen atoms, whereas unsaturated fats have some of these carbon atoms [[Double bond|double-bonded]], so their molecules have relatively fewer hydrogen atoms than a saturated fatty acid of the same length. Unsaturated fats may be further classified as monounsaturated (one double-bond) or polyunsaturated (many double-bonds). Furthermore, depending on the location of the double-bond in the fatty acid chain, unsaturated fatty acids are classified as [[omega-3]] or [[omega-6]] fatty acids. [[Trans fat]]s are a type of unsaturated fat with ''trans''-isomer bonds; these are rare in nature and in foods from natural sources; they are typically created in an industrial process called (partial) [[hydrogenation]].  There are nine kilocalories in each gram of fat. Fatty acids such as [[conjugated linoleic acid]], catalpic acid, eleostearic acid and [[punicic acid]], in addition to providing energy, represent potent immune modulatory molecules.

Saturated fats (typically from animal sources) have been a staple in many world cultures for millennia. Unsaturated fats (e. g., vegetable oil) are considered healthier, while trans fats are to be avoided.  Saturated and some trans fats are typically solid at room temperature (such as [[butter]] or [[lard]]), while unsaturated fats are typically liquids (such as [[olive oil]] or [[flaxseed oil]]). Trans fats are very rare in nature, and have been shown to be highly detrimental to human health, but have properties useful in the [[food processing]] industry, such as rancidity resistance.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Klonoff|first=David C.|date=2016-06-24|year=|title=Replacements for Trans Fats—Will There Be an Oil Shortage?|pmc=2769584|journal=Journal of Diabetes Science and Technology|language=en|volume=1|issue=3|pages=415–422|doi=10.1177/193229680700100316|pmid=19885099}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Essential fatty acids ====
{{Main|Essential fatty acids}}
Most fatty acids are non-essential, meaning the body can produce them as needed, generally from other fatty acids and always by expending energy to do so. However, in humans, at least two fatty acids are [[essential fatty acid|essential]] and must be included in the diet. An appropriate balance of essential fatty acids—[[omega-3]] and [[omega-6 fatty acid]]s—seems also important for health, although definitive experimental demonstration has been elusive. Both of these "omega" long-chain [[unsaturated fat|polyunsaturated fatty acids]] are [[substrate (biochemistry)|substrates]] for a class of [[eicosanoid]]s known as [[prostaglandin]]s, which have roles throughout the human body. They are [[hormone]]s, in some respects. The omega-3 [[eicosapentaenoic acid]] (EPA), which can be made in the human body from the omega-3 essential fatty acid [[alpha-linolenic acid]] (ALA), or taken in through marine food sources, serves as a building block for series 3 prostaglandins (e.g., weakly [[Inflammation|inflammatory]] PGE3). The omega-6 dihomo-gamma-linolenic acid (DGLA) serves as a building block for series 1 prostaglandins (e.g. anti-inflammatory PGE1), whereas arachidonic acid (AA) serves as a building block for series 2 prostaglandins (e.g. pro-inflammatory PGE 2). Both DGLA and AA can be made from the omega-6 [[linoleic acid]] (LA) in the human body, or can be taken in directly through food. An appropriately balanced intake of omega-3 and omega-6 partly determines the relative production of different prostaglandins, which is one reason why a balance between omega-3 and omega-6 is believed important for cardiovascular health. In industrialized societies, people typically consume large amounts of processed vegetable oils, which have reduced amounts of the essential fatty acids along with too much of omega-6 fatty acids relative to omega-3 fatty acids.

The conversion rate of omega-6 DGLA to AA largely determines the production of the prostaglandins PGE1 and PGE2. Omega-3 EPA prevents AA from being released from membranes, thereby skewing prostaglandin balance away from pro-inflammatory PGE2 (made from AA) toward anti-inflammatory PGE1 (made from DGLA). Moreover, the conversion (desaturation) of DGLA to AA is controlled by the enzyme [[desaturase|delta-5-desaturase]], which in turn is controlled by hormones such as [[insulin]] (up-regulation) and [[glucagon]] (down-regulation). The amount and type of carbohydrates consumed, along with some types of amino acid, can influence processes involving insulin, glucagon, and other hormones; therefore, the ratio of omega-3 versus omega-6 has wide effects on general health, and specific effects on immune function and [[inflammation]], and [[mitosis]] (i.e., cell division).

====Protein====
[[File:Myoglobin.png|thumb|right|Proteins are chains of amino acids found in most nutritional foods.]]

{{Main|Protein (nutrient)}}

Proteins are structural materials in much of the animal body (e.g. muscles, skin, and hair). They also form the enzymes that control chemical reactions throughout the body. Each protein molecule is composed of [[amino acid]]s, which are characterized by inclusion of nitrogen and sometimes sulphur (these components are responsible for the distinctive smell of burning protein, such as the [[keratin]] in hair). The body requires amino acids to produce new proteins (protein retention) and to replace damaged proteins (maintenance). As there is no protein or amino acid storage provision, amino acids must be present in the diet. Excess amino acids are discarded, typically in the urine. For all animals, some amino acids are ''[[essential amino acid|essential]]'' (an animal cannot produce them internally) and some are ''[[non-essential amino acid|non-essential]]'' (the animal can produce them from other nitrogen-containing compounds). About twenty amino acids are found in the human body, and about ten of these are essential and, therefore, must be included in the diet. A diet that contains adequate amounts of amino acids (especially those that are essential) is particularly important in some situations: during early development and maturation, pregnancy, lactation, or injury (a burn, for instance). A ''complete'' protein source contains all the essential amino acids; an ''incomplete'' protein source lacks one or more of the essential amino acids.

It is possible with [[protein combination]]s of two incomplete protein sources (e.g., rice and beans) to make a complete protein source, and characteristic combinations are the basis of distinct cultural cooking traditions. However, complementary sources of protein do not need to be eaten at the same meal to be used together by the body.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=American Dietetic Association|title=Position of the American Dietetic Association and Dietitians of Canada: Vegetarian diets|journal= JADA|year= 2003|volume= 103|issue=6|pages= 748–765|pmid=12778049|doi=10.1053/jada.2003.50142|last2=Dietitians Of|first2=Canada}}&lt;/ref&gt; Excess amino acids from protein can be converted into glucose and used for fuel through a process called [[gluconeogenesis]].

====Water====
{{Main|Drinking water}}
[[Image:TapWater-china.JPG|thumb|left|A manual [[water]] [[pump]] in [[China]]]]
Water is excreted from the body in multiple forms; including [[urine]] and [[feces]], [[sweating]], and by [[water vapour]] in the exhaled breath. Therefore, it is necessary to adequately rehydrate to replace lost fluids.

Early recommendations for the quantity of water required for maintenance of good health suggested that 6–8 glasses of water daily is the minimum to maintain proper [[Tissue hydration|hydration]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/health/healthy_living/nutrition/drinks_water.shtml |title=Healthy Water Living|publisher=BBC. Retrieved 2007-02-01 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070101100025/http://www.bbc.co.uk/health/healthy_living/nutrition/drinks_water.shtml |archivedate=2007-01-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; However the notion that a person should consume eight glasses of water per day cannot be traced to a credible scientific source.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ajpregu.physiology.org/cgi/content/full/283/5/R993|title="Drink at least eight glasses of water a day."

Most of this quantity is contained in prepared foods."&lt;ref&gt;Food and Nutrition Board, National Academy of Sciences. Recommended Dietary Allowances, revised 1945. National Research Council, Reprint and Circular Series, No. 122, 1945 (Aug), pp. 3–18.&lt;/ref&gt; More recent comparisons of well-known recommendations on fluid intake have revealed large discrepancies in the volumes of water we need to consume for good health.&lt;ref name="Le Bellego"&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Le Bellego L, Jean C, Jiménez L, Magnani C, Tang W, Boutrolle I |title= Understanding fluid consumption patterns to improve healthy hydration|journal= Nutr Today|year= 2010|volume=45|issue=6|pages=S22–S26|doi=10.1097/NT.0b013e3181fe4314 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, to help standardize guidelines, recommendations for water consumption are included in two recent [[European Food Safety Authority]] (EFSA) documents (2010): (i) Food-based dietary guidelines and (ii) Dietary reference values for water or adequate daily intakes (ADI).&lt;ref name="Scientific Opinion on Dietary Reference Values for water"&gt;{{cite journal|author=EFSA Panel on Dietetic Products, Nutrition and Allergies (NDA)|doi=10.2903/j.efsa.2010.1459|title=Scientific Opinion on Dietary Reference Values for Water|journal=EFSA Journal |year=2010|volume=8|issue=3|page=1459|url=http://orbit.dtu.dk/files/6350877/5.Scientific.pdf}}{{open access}}&lt;/ref&gt;  These specifications were provided by calculating adequate intakes from measured intakes in populations of individuals with “desirable osmolarity values of urine and desirable water volumes per energy unit consumed.”&lt;ref name="Scientific Opinion on Dietary Reference Values for water" /&gt;

For healthful hydration, the current EFSA guidelines recommend total water intakes of 2.0 L/day for adult females and 2.5 L/day for adult males. These reference values include water from drinking water, other beverages, and from food. About 80% of our daily water requirement comes from the beverages we drink, with the remaining 20% coming from food.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Armstrong LE, Pumerantz AC, Roti MW, Judelson DA, Watson G, Dias JC, Sokmen B, Casa DJ, Maresh CM | year = 2005 | title = Fluid, electrolyte, and renal indices of hydration during 11 days of controlled caffeine consumption | journal = Int J Sport Nutr Exerc Metab | volume = 15 | issue = 3| pages = 252–65 |pmid=16131696 |display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Water content varies depending on the type of food consumed, with fruit and vegetables containing more than cereals, for example.&lt;ref name="FAO"&gt;[http://www.fao.org/docrep/003/x9892e/x9892e00.htm "FAO Corporate Document Repository.

The EFSA panel also determined intakes for different populations. Recommended intake volumes in the elderly are the same as for adults as despite lower energy consumption, the water requirement of this group is increased due to a reduction in renal concentrating capacity.&lt;ref name="Scientific Opinion on Dietary Reference Values for water" /&gt; [[Pregnant]] and [[breastfeeding]] women require additional fluids to stay hydrated. The EFSA panel proposes that pregnant women should consume the same volume of water as non-pregnant women, plus an increase in proportion to the higher energy requirement, equal to 300 mL/day.&lt;ref name="Scientific Opinion on Dietary Reference Values for water" /&gt; To compensate for additional fluid output, breastfeeding women require an additional 700 mL/day above the recommended intake values for non-lactating women. Dehydration and over-hydration - too little and too much water, respectively - can have harmful consequences. Drinking too much water is one of the possible causes of [[hyponatremia]], i.e., low serum sodium.&lt;ref name="Scientific Opinion on Dietary Reference Values for water" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|pmc=1770067|title=Fatal water intoxication |journal= Journal of Clinical Pathology | date=October 2003|pmid=14514793|volume=56|issue=10|vauthors=Farrell DJ, Bower L |pages=803–4|doi=10.1136/jcp.56.10.803-a}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Alcohol (ethanol)====
Pure ethanol provides 7 calories per gram. For [[distilled spirit]]s, a standard serving in the United States is 1.5 fluid ounces, which at 40% ethanol (80 proof), would be 14 grams and 98 calories.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://health.gov/dietaryguidelines/2015/guidelines/appendix-9/#footnote2|title=Appendix 9. Alcohol|last=|first=|date=|website=health.gov|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Wine and beer contain a similar range of ethanol for servings of 5 ounces and 12 ounces, respectively, but these beverages also contain non-ethanol calories. A 5 ounce serving of wine contains 100 to 130 calories. A 12 ounce serving of beer contains 95 to 200 calories.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://deanofstudents.cua.edu/alcohol/alcohol-facts/nutrition.cfm|title=Alcohol and Nutrition: The Calorie and Carb Breakdown!|last=|first=|date=|website=The Catholic University of America|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  According to the U.S. Department of Agriculture, based on [[NHANES]] 2013-2014 surveys, women ages 20 and up consume on average 6.8 grams/day and men consume on average 15.5 grams/day.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.ars.usda.gov/ARSUserFiles/80400530/pdf/1314/Table_1_NIN_GEN_13.pdf "What We Eat in America, NHANES 2013-2014"]&lt;/ref&gt; Ignoring the non-alcohol contribution of those beverages, the average ethanol calorie contributions are 48 and 108 cal/day. Alcoholic beverages are considered [[empty calorie]] foods because other than calories, these contribute no essential nutrients.

===Micronutrients===
The micronutrients are [[Dietary mineral|minerals]], [[vitamin]]s, and others.&lt;ref name=Fuhrman&gt;{{cite book|author=Fuhrman, Joel|title=The End of Dieting|publisher=Harper One (Harper Collins)|year=2014|isbn=978-0-06-224932-6|pages=101–102}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Minerals====
{{Main|Mineral (nutrient)|Composition of the human body}}

Dietary minerals are [[inorganic compounds|inorganic]] [[chemical element]]s required by living organisms,&lt;ref name="Mitchell, Dakota and Haroun, Lee 2012 279"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Mitchell, Dakota  |author2=Haroun, Lee|title=Introduction to Health Care|year=2012|edition=3|publisher=Delmar Cengage|isbn=978-1-435-48755-0|page=279}}&lt;/ref&gt; other than the four elements [[carbon]], [[hydrogen]], [[nitrogen]], and [[oxygen]] that are present in nearly all [[organic chemistry|organic molecules]]. The term "mineral" is archaic, since the intent is to describe simply the less common elements in the diet. Some are heavier than the four just mentioned, including several [[metal]]s, which often occur as ions in the body. Some dietitians recommend that these be supplied from foods in which they occur naturally, or at least as complex compounds, or sometimes even from natural inorganic sources (such as [[calcium carbonate]] from ground [[oyster]] shells). Some minerals are absorbed much more readily in the ionic forms found in such sources. On the other hand, minerals are often artificially added to the diet as supplements; the most famous is likely iodine in [[iodized salt]] which prevents [[goiter]].

=====Macrominerals=====
Many elements are essential nutrients called [[dietary minerals]]. Some have roles as [[Cofactor (biochemistry)|cofactors]], while others are [[electrolyte]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author1=Nelson, D. L. |author2=Cox, M. M. | title=Lehninger Principles of Biochemistry | edition=3rd | publisher=Worth Publishing | location=New York | year=2000 |  isbn=978-1-57259-153-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; Elements with recommended dietary allowance ([[Recommended Dietary Allowance|RDA]]) greater than 150 &amp;nbsp;mg/day are, in alphabetical order:
* [[Calcium]], a common electrolyte, but also needed structurally (for muscle and digestive system health, bone strength, some forms neutralize acidity, provides signaling ions for nerve and membrane functions)
* [[Chloride]]; electrolyte; see sodium, below
* [[Magnesium]], required for processing [[Adenosine triphosphate|ATP]] and related reactions (builds bone, facilitates [[peristalsis]])
* [[Phosphorus]], required component of bones; essential for energy processing&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author= Corbridge, D. E. C. | title=Phosphorus: An Outline of its Chemistry, Biochemistry, and Technology | edition=5th | publisher=Elsevier | location=Amsterdam | year=1995 | isbn=978-0-444-89307-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Potassium]], an electrolyte (heart and nerve functions)
* [[Sodium]], an electrolyte; common in food and manufactured beverages, typically as [[sodium chloride]]. Excessive sodium consumption can deplete [[calcium]] and [[magnesium]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.fao.org/docrep/004/Y2809E/y2809e0k.htm|title=Chapter 14. Magnesium|last=|first=|date=|website=Food and Agriculture Organization of the United States|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; leading to high blood pressure.

=====Trace minerals=====

Many elements are required in trace amounts, usually because they play a [[catalytic]] role in [[enzyme]]s.&lt;ref name=lipp&gt;{{cite book |author1=Lippard, S. J.  |author2=Berg, J. M. | title=Principles of Bioinorganic Chemistry | publisher=University Science Books | location=Mill Valley, CA | year=1994|isbn=978-0935702729}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some trace mineral elements (RDA &lt; 200&amp;nbsp;mg/day) are, in alphabetical order:
* [[Cobalt]] required for biosynthesis of [[vitamin B12]] family of [[coenzyme]]s.  Animals cannot biosynthesize B12, and must obtain this cobalt-containing vitamin in their diet.
* [[Copper]] required component of many redox enzymes, including [[cytochrome c oxidase]] {{main|Copper in health}}
* [[Chromium]] required for sugar metabolism
* [[Iodine]] required not only for the biosynthesis of [[thyroxine]] but also&amp;nbsp;— it is presumed&amp;nbsp;— for other important organs as breast, stomach, salivary glands, thymus, etc. (see Extrathyroidal [[iodine]]); for this reason iodine is needed in larger quantities than others in this list, and sometimes classified with the macrominerals
* [[Iron]] required for many enzymes, and for [[hemoglobin]] and some other proteins
* [[Manganese]] (processing of oxygen)
* [[Molybdenum]] required for [[xanthine oxidase]] and related oxidases
* [[Selenium]] required for [[peroxidase]] (antioxidant proteins)
* [[Zinc]] required for several enzymes such as [[carboxypeptidase]], [[Alcohol dehydrogenase#In humans|liver alcohol dehydrogenase]], and [[carbonic anhydrase]]

====Vitamins====
{{Main|Vitamin}}

Vitamins are essential nutrients,&lt;ref name="Mitchell, Dakota and Haroun, Lee 2012 279"/&gt; necessary in the diet for good health. ([[Vitamin D]] is an exception, as it can be synthesized in the skin in the presence of [[UVB radiation]], and many animal species can synthesize vitamin C.) Vitamin deficiencies may result in disease conditions, including [[goitre]], [[scurvy]], [[osteoporosis]], impaired immune system, disorders of cell metabolism, certain forms of cancer, symptoms of premature aging, and poor [[psychology|psychological health]], among many others.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | editor=Shils, M. S.| year=2005 | title=Modern Nutrition in Health and Disease | publisher=Lippincott Williams and Wilkins | isbn=978-0-7817-4133-0|display-editors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; Excess levels of some vitamins are also dangerous to health. The Food and Nutrition Board of the Institute of Medicine has established Tolerable Upper Intake Levels (ULs) for seven vitamins.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation| title = Dietary Reference Intakes (DRIs): Tolerable Upper Intake Levels, Vitamins | url = https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK56068/table/summarytables.t7/?report=objectonly}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Phytochemicals==
{{Main|Phytochemical}}
{{See also|List of antioxidants in food}}

Phytochemicals such as [[polyphenol]]s are compounds produced naturally in plants (phyto means "plant" in Greek). In general, the term identifies compounds that are prevalent in plant foods, but are not proven to be essential for human nutrition, as of 2018. There is no conclusive evidence in humans that polyphenols or other non-nutrient compounds from plants confer health benefits, mainly because these compounds have poor [[bioavailability]], i,e., following ingestion, they are digested into smaller [[metabolite]]s with unknown functions, then are rapidly eliminated from the body.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|pmc=2871118|year=2010|last1=d'Archivio|first1=M.|title=Bioavailability of the polyphenols: status and controversies|journal=International Journal of Molecular Sciences|volume=11|issue=4|pages=1321–1342|last2=Filesi|first2=C.|last3=Varì|first3=R.|last4=Scazzocchio|first4=B.|last5=Masella|first5=R.|pmid=20480022|doi=10.3390/ijms11041321}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="acs"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cancer.org/healthy/eat-healthy-get-active/acs-guidelines-nutrition-physical-activity-cancer-prevention/common-questions.html?_ga=2.57358826.1597423548.1542983382-1390869997.1542983382|title=Common questions about diet and cancer|date=5 February 2016|publisher=[[American Cancer Society]]|accessdate=23 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

While initial studies sought to reveal if [[dietary supplement]]s might promote health, one [[meta-analysis]] concluded that supplementation with antioxidant vitamins A and E and beta-carotene did not convey any benefits, and may increase risk of death.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Bjelakovic G |title=Mortality in randomized trials of antioxidant supplements for primary and secondary prevention: systematic review and meta-analysis |journal=JAMA |volume=297 |issue=8 |pages=842–57 |year=2007 |pmid=17327526 |doi=10.1001/jama.297.8.842 |last2=Nikolova |first2=D |last3=Gluud |first3=LL |last4=Simonetti |first4=RG |last5=Gluud |first5=C}}&lt;/ref&gt; Vitamin C and selenium supplements did not impact mortality rate. Health effects of non-nutrient phytochemicals such as polyphenols were not assessed in this review.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.slate.com/id/2300578/ |title=The Doctor and the Pomegranate|publisher=Slate|author=Sepkowitz, Kent |date= 3 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Colorfull.jpg|thumb|Colorful fruits and vegetables may be components of a healthy diet.]]

==Intestinal bacterial flora==
{{Main|Gut flora}}
Animal intestines contain a large population of [[gut flora]]. In humans, the four dominant [[phylum|phyla]] are [[Firmicutes]], [[Bacteroidetes]], [[Actinobacteria]], and [[Proteobacteria]].&lt;ref name="pmid24388028"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Khanna S, Tosh PK |title=A clinician's primer on the role of the microbiome in human health and disease |journal=Mayo Clin. Proc. |volume=89 |issue=1 |pages=107–14 |date=January 2014 |pmid=24388028 |doi=10.1016/j.mayocp.2013.10.011 |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; They are essential to [[digestion]] and are also affected by food that is consumed. Bacteria in the large intestine perform many important functions for humans, including breaking down and aiding in the absorption of fermentable fiber, stimulating cell growth, repressing the growth of harmful bacteria, training the immune system to respond only to pathogens, producing [[vitamin B12|vitamin B&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt;]], and defending against some infectious diseases.&lt;ref name="Guarner and Malagelada 2003b"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(03)12489-0 |title=Gut flora in health and disease |year=2003 |last1=Guarner |first1=F |last2=Malagelada |first2=J |journal=The Lancet |volume=361 |issue=9356 |pages=512–9 |pmid=12583961}}&lt;/ref&gt; "[[Probiotic]]s" refers to the idea of deliberately consuming live bacteria in an attempt to change the bacterial population in the large intestine, to the health benefit of the host human or animal. "[[Prebiotic (nutrition)]]" refers to the idea that consuming a bacterial energy source such as soluble fiber could support the population of health-beneficial bacteria in the large intestine. There is not yet a scientific consensus as to health benefits accruing from probiotics or prebiotics.

==Animal nutrition==
{{main|Animal nutrition|Human nutrition}}

[[Carnivore]] and [[herbivore]] diets are contrasting, with basic [[nitrogen]] and [[carbon]] proportions vary for their particular foods. Many herbivores rely on bacterial fermentation to create digestible nutrients from indigestible plant cellulose, while obligate carnivores must eat animal meats to obtain certain vitamins or nutrients their bodies cannot otherwise synthesize.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=National Geographic Society|title=herbivore|url=https://www.nationalgeographic.org/encyclopedia/herbivore/|website=National Geographic Society|accessdate=1 May 2017|language=en|date=21 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Plant nutrition==

{{Main|Plant nutrition}}
Plant nutrition is the study of the [[chemical element]]s that are necessary for plant growth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Handbook of Plant Nutrition|author1=Allen V. Barker |author2=David J. Pilbeam | page=Preface| publisher=CRC Press, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are several principles that apply to plant nutrition. Some elements are directly involved in plant [[metabolism]]. However, this principle does not account for the so-called beneficial elements, whose presence, while not required, has clear positive effects on plant growth.

A nutrient that is able to limit plant growth according to [[Liebig's law of the minimum]] is considered an essential plant nutrient if the plant cannot complete its full life cycle without it. There are 16 essential plant soil nutrients, besides the three major elemental nutrients carbon and oxygen that are obtained by photosynthetic plants from carbon dioxide in air, and [[hydrogen]], which is obtained from water.

Plants uptake essential elements from the [[soil]] through their [[root]]s and from the air (consisting of mainly nitrogen and oxygen) through their [[Leaf|leaves]]. Green plants obtain their carbohydrate supply from the carbon dioxide in the air by the process of [[photosynthesis]]. Carbon and oxygen are absorbed from the air, while other nutrients are absorbed from the soil. Nutrient uptake in the soil is achieved by [[cation exchange]], wherein [[root hair]]s pump [[hydrogen ion]]s (H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;) into the soil through [[proton pump]]s. These hydrogen ions displace [[cation]]s attached to negatively charged soil particles so that the cations are available for uptake by the root. In the leaves, [[stomata]] open to take in carbon dioxide and expel [[oxygen]]. The carbon dioxide molecules are used as the carbon source in photosynthesis.

Although [[nitrogen]] is plentiful in the Earth's atmosphere, very few plants can use this directly. Most plants, therefore, require nitrogen compounds to be present in the soil in which they grow. This is made possible by the fact that largely inert atmospheric nitrogen is changed in a [[nitrogen fixation]] process to biologically usable forms in the soil by bacteria.&lt;ref&gt;Lindemann, W.C. and Glover C.R. (2003) [http://aces.nmsu.edu/pubs/_a/A129/welcome.html Nitrogen Fixation by Legumes]. New Mexico State University/&lt;/ref&gt;

Plant nutrition is a difficult subject to understand completely, partially because of the variation between different plants and even between different species or individuals of a given [[cloning|clone]]. Elements present at low levels may cause deficiency symptoms, and toxicity is possible at levels that are too high. Furthermore, deficiency of one element may present as symptoms of toxicity from another element, and vice versa.

==Advice and guidance==

===Government policies===
[[Canada's Food Guide]] is an example of a government-run nutrition program. Produced by [[Health Canada]], the guide advises food quantities, provides education on balanced nutrition, and promotes physical activity in accordance with government-mandated nutrient needs. Like other nutrition programs around the world, Canada's Food Guide divides nutrition into four main food groups: vegetables and fruit, grain products, milk and alternatives, and meat and alternatives.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20170612160554/http://www.hc-sc.gc.ca/fn-an/food-guide-aliment/index-eng.php Canada's Food Guide]. Health Canada&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike its American counterpart, the Canadian guide references and provides alternative to meat and dairy, which can be attributed to the growing [[vegan]] and [[vegetarian]] movements.

In the US, nutritional standards and recommendations are established jointly by the [[USDA|US Department of Agriculture]] and [[United States Department of Health and Human Services|US Department of Health and Human Services]] and these recommendations are published as the [[Dietary Guidelines for Americans]]. Dietary and physical activity guidelines from the USDA are presented in the concept of [[MyPlate]], which superseded the [[MyPyramid|food pyramid]], which replaced the [[Four Food Groups]]. The Senate committee currently responsible for oversight of the USDA is the ''Agriculture, Nutrition and Forestry Committee''. Committee hearings are often televised on [[C-SPAN]]. The [[U.S. Department of Health and Human Services]] provides a sample week-long menu that fulfills the nutritional recommendations of the government.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20080308032337/http://www.mypyramid.gov/downloads/sample_menu.pdf Sample Menus for a 2000 Calorie Food Pattern]. mypyramid.gov&lt;/ref&gt;

===Government programs===
Governmental organisations have been working on nutrition literacy interventions in non-primary health care settings to address the nutrition information problem in the U.S. Some programs include:

The Family Nutrition Program (FNP) is a free nutrition education program serving low-income adults around the U.S. This program is funded by the Food Nutrition Service’s (FNS) branch of the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) usually through a local state academic institution that runs the program.  The FNP has developed a series of tools to help families participating in the Food Stamp Program stretch their food dollar and form healthful eating habits including nutrition education.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Guthrie|first=Joanne F.|last2=Stommes|first2=Eileen|last3=Voichick|first3=Jane|date=January–February 2006|title=Evaluating Food Stamp Nutrition Education: Issues and Opportunities|url=https://www.jneb.org/article/S1499-4046(05)00003-5/fulltext|journal=Journal of Nutrition Education and Behavior|volume=38|issue=1|pages=6–11|doi=10.1016/j.jneb.2005.11.001}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[https://web.archive.org/web/20111118025724/http://www.csrees.usda.gov/nea/food/efnep/efnep.html Expanded Food and Nutrition Education Program] (ENFEP) is a unique program that currently operates in all 50 states and in American Samoa, Guam, Micronesia, Northern Marianas, Puerto Rico, and the Virgin Islands. It is designed to assist limited-resource audiences in acquiring the knowledge, skills, attitudes, and changed behavior necessary for nutritionally sound diets, and to contribute to their personal development and the improvement of the total family diet and nutritional well-being.

An example of a state initiative to promote nutrition literacy is [https://web.archive.org/web/20120221061109/http://www.smartbodies.org/smart-bodies Smart Bodies], a public-private partnership between the state’s largest university system and largest health insurer, Louisiana State Agricultural Center and Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Louisiana Foundation.  Launched in 2005, this program promotes lifelong healthful eating patterns and physically active lifestyles for children and their families.  It is an interactive educational program designed to help prevent childhood obesity through classroom activities that teach children healthful eating habits and physical exercise.

===Education===
Nutrition is [[Teaching|taught]] in schools in many countries. In [[England and Wales]], the [[Personal and Social Education]] and Food Technology curricula include nutrition, stressing the importance of a balanced diet and teaching how to read nutrition labels on packaging.  In many schools, a Nutrition class will fall within the Family and Consumer Science or Health departments.  In some American schools, students are required to take a certain number of FCS or Health related classes.  Nutrition is offered at many schools, and, if it is not a class of its own, nutrition is included in other FCS or Health classes such as: Life Skills, Independent Living, Single Survival, Freshmen Connection, Health etc.  In many Nutrition classes, students learn about the food groups, the food pyramid, Daily Recommended Allowances, calories, vitamins, minerals, malnutrition, physical activity, healthful food choices, portion sizes, and how to live a healthy life.

A 1985, US [[United States National Research Council|National Research Council]] report entitled ''Nutrition Education in US Medical Schools'' concluded that nutrition education in medical schools was inadequate.&lt;ref&gt;Commission on Life Sciences. (1985). ''Nutrition Education in US Medical Schools'', [http://books.nap.edu/openbook.php?record_id=597&amp;page=4 p. 4]. National Academies Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Only 20% of the schools surveyed taught nutrition as a separate, required course. A 2006 survey found that this number had risen to 30%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Adams KM, Lindell KC, Kohlmeier M, Zeisel SH |title=Status of nutrition education in medical schools |journal=Am.

===Professional organizations===
In the US, [[Dietitian|Registered dietitian nutritionists]] (RDs or RDNs)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=What is an RDN and DTR?|url=http://www.eatrightpro.org/resources/about-us/what-is-an-rdn-and-dtr|publisher=Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics|accessdate=May 9, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; are [[health professionals]] qualified to provide safe, evidence-based dietary advice which includes a review of what is eaten, a thorough review of nutritional health, and a personalized nutritional treatment plan. They also provide preventive and therapeutic programs at work places, schools and similar institutions. Certified Clinical [[Nutritionist]]s or CCNs, are trained health professionals who also offer dietary advice on the role of nutrition in chronic disease, including possible prevention or remediation by addressing nutritional deficiencies before resorting to drugs.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.iaacn.org/ The International &amp; American Associations of Clinical Nutritionist, 2014, Retrieved 2014-12-14&lt;/ref&gt; Government regulation especially in terms of licensing, is currently less universal for the CCN than that of RD or RDN. Another advanced Nutrition Professional is a Certified Nutrition Specialist or CNS. These Board Certified Nutritionists typically specialize in [[obesity]] and [[chronic disease]]. In order to become board certified, potential CNS candidate must pass an examination, much like Registered Dieticians. This exam covers specific domains within the health sphere including; Clinical Intervention and Human Health.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = FAQs about CNS Certification – Certification Board for Nutrition Specialists|url = http://cbns.org/faqs-cns-certification/|accessdate = 2015-09-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Nutrition literacy==
The findings of the 2003 National Assessment of Adult Literacy (NAAL) provide a basis upon which to frame the nutrition literacy problem in the U.S. NAAL introduced the first ever measure of "the degree to which individuals have the capacity to obtain, process and understand basic health information and services needed to make appropriate health decisions"&amp;nbsp;– an objective of Healthy People 2010&lt;ref&gt;Baldi, S. (ED.) et al. (2009). [http://nces.ed.gov/pubsearch/pubsinfo.asp?pubid=2009476 Technical Report and Data File User’s Manual for the 2003 National Assessment of Adult Literacy (NCES 2009–47)]. U.S. Department of Education, National Center for Education Statistics. Washington, D.C.: U.S. Government Printing Office.&lt;/ref&gt; and of which nutrition literacy might be considered an important subset. On a scale of below basic, basic, intermediate and proficient, NAAL found 13 percent of adult Americans have proficient health literacy, 44% have intermediate literacy, 29 percent have basic literacy and 14 percent have below basic health literacy. The study found that health literacy increases with education and people living below the level of poverty have lower health literacy than those above it.

Another study examining the health and nutrition literacy status of residents of the lower Mississippi Delta found that 52 percent of participants had a high likelihood of limited literacy skills.&lt;ref name="cdc.gov"&gt;{{cite journal|author=Zoellner, J., Connell, C., Bounds, W., Crook, L., Yadrick, K. |year=2009|title= Nutrition Literacy Status and Preferred Nutrition Communications Channels Among Adults in the Lower Mississippi Delta|journal= Preventing Chronic Disease|volume= 6|issue=4|pages=A128|url=https://www.cdc.gov/pcd/issues/2009/oct/08_0016.htm|pmid=19755004|pmc=2774642 }}&lt;/ref&gt; While a precise comparison between the NAAL and Delta studies is difficult, primarily because of methodological differences, Zoellner et al. suggest that health literacy rates in the Mississippi Delta region are different from the U.S. general population and that they help establish the scope of the problem of health literacy among adults in the Delta region. For example, only 12 percent of study participants identified the My Pyramid graphic two years after it had been launched by the USDA. The study also found significant relationships between nutrition literacy and income level and nutrition literacy and educational attainment&lt;ref name="cdc.gov"/&gt; further delineating priorities for the region.

These statistics point to the complexities surrounding the lack of health/nutrition literacy and reveal the degree to which they are embedded in the social structure and interconnected with other problems. Among these problems are the lack of information about food choices, a lack of understanding of nutritional information and its application to individual circumstances, limited or difficult access to healthful foods, and a range of cultural influences and socioeconomic constraints such as low levels of education and high levels of poverty that decrease opportunities for healthful eating and living.

The links between low health literacy and poor health outcomes has been widely documented&lt;ref&gt;Berkman N. D., Sheridan, S.L., Donahue, K. E., Halpern, D.J., Viera, A., Crotty, K., … Viswanathan, M. (2011). [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK82434/ Health and Literacy Intervention Outcomes: an Updated Systematic Review. Evidence Report/Technology Assessment no. 199]. Prepared by RTI International – University of North Carolina Evidence-based Practice Center. Publication Number 11-E006. Rockville, MD. Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality.&lt;/ref&gt; and there is evidence that some interventions to improve health literacy have produced successful results in the primary care setting. More must be done to further our understanding of nutrition literacy specific interventions in non-primary care settings&lt;ref name="cdc.gov"/&gt; in order to achieve better health outcomes.

==Malnutrition==
{{Main|Malnutrition}}

Malnutrition refers to insufficient, excessive, or imbalanced consumption of nutrients by an organism. In developed countries, the diseases of malnutrition are most often associated with nutritional imbalances or excessive consumption. In developing countries, malnutrition is more likely to be caused by poor access to a range of nutritious foods or inadequate knowledge. In [[Mali]], the [[International Crops Research Institute for the Semi-Arid Tropics]] ([[ICRISAT]]) and the [[Aga Khan Foundation]] trained women's groups to make ''equinut'', a healthy and nutritional version of the traditional recipe ''di-dèguè'' (comprising peanut paste, honey and millet or rice flour). The aim was to boost nutrition and livelihoods by producing a product that women could make and sell, and which would be accepted by the local community because of its local heritage.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.impatientoptimists.org/Posts/2013/04/Nourishing-Communities-Through-Holistic-Farming ''Nourishing communities through holistic farming''], Impatient optimists, [[Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation]].

The U.S. Food and Nutrition Board sets Estimated Average Requirements (EARs) and Recommended Dietary Allowances (RDAs) for vitamins and minerals. EARs and RDAs are part of [[Dietary Reference Intake]]s.&lt;ref name="ods.od.nih.gov"&gt;[https://ods.od.nih.gov/Health_Information/Dietary_Reference_Intakes.aspx]
Nutrient recommendations: Dietary Reference Intakes (DRI).&lt;/ref&gt; The DRI documents describe nutrient deficiency signs and symptoms.

===Excessive===
The U.S. Food and Nutrition Board sets Tolerable Upper Intake Levels (known as ULs) for vitamins and minerals when evidence is sufficient. ULs are set a safe fraction below amounts shown to cause health problems. ULs are part of [[Dietary Reference Intake]]s.&lt;ref name="ods.od.nih.gov"/&gt; The [[European Food Safety Authority]] also reviews the same safety questions and set its own ULs.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation| title = Tolerable Upper Intake Levels For Vitamins And Minerals| publisher = European Food Safety Authority| year = 2006| url = http://www.efsa.europa.eu/sites/default/files/efsa_rep/blobserver_assets/ndatolerableuil.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Unbalanced===
When too much of one or more nutrients is present in the diet to the exclusion of the proper amount of other nutrients, the diet is said to be unbalanced. High calorie food ingredients such as vegetable oils, sugar and alcohol are referred to as [[Empty calorie|"empty calories"]] because they displace from the diet foods that also contain protein, vitamins, minerals and fiber.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=What are empty calories? |website=USDA MyPlate 2011 |url=http://www.choosemyplate.gov/weight-management-calories/calories/empty-calories.html |accessdate=2017-10-20 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140130125320/http://www.choosemyplate.gov/weight-management-calories/calories/empty-calories.html |archivedate=2014-01-30 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Processed foods==

{{Main|Food processing}}

Since the [[Industrial Revolution]] some two hundred years ago, the food processing industry has invented many [[technology|technologies]] that both help keep foods fresh longer and alter the fresh state of food as they appear in nature. Cooling is the primary technology used to maintain freshness, whereas many more technologies have been invented to allow foods to last longer without becoming spoiled. These latter technologies include [[pasteurisation]], [[autoclavation]], [[drying]], [[salting (food)|salting]], and separation of various components, all of which appearing to alter the original nutritional contents of food. Pasteurisation and autoclavation (heating techniques) have no doubt improved the safety of many common foods, preventing epidemics of bacterial infection. But some of the (new) food processing technologies have downfalls as well.

Modern separation techniques such as [[Gristmill|milling]], [[centrifugation]], and [[Expeller pressing|pressing]] have enabled concentration of particular components of food, yielding flour, oils, juices, and so on, and even separate fatty acids, amino acids, vitamins, and minerals. Inevitably, such large-scale concentration changes the nutritional content of food, saving certain nutrients while removing others. Heating techniques may also reduce food's content of many heat-labile nutrients such as certain vitamins and phytochemicals, and possibly other yet-to-be-discovered substances.&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite journal|last=Morris|first=Audrey |author2=Audia Barnett |author3=Olive-Jean Burrows|title=Effect of Processing on Nutrient Content of Foods|journal=Cajanus|volume=37|issue=3|pages=160–164|year=2004|url=http://www.paho.org/English/CFNI/cfni-caj37No304-art-3.pdf|accessdate=2006-10-26|format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because of reduced nutritional value, processed foods are often 'enriched' or 'fortified' with some of the most critical nutrients (usually certain vitamins) that were lost during processing. Nonetheless, processed foods tend to have an inferior nutritional profile compared to whole, fresh foods, regarding content of both sugar and high GI starches, [[potassium]]/[[sodium]], vitamins, fiber, and of intact, unoxidized (essential) fatty acids. In addition,
processed foods often contain potentially harmful substances such as oxidized fats and trans fatty acids.

A dramatic example of the effect of food processing on a population's health is the history of epidemics of [[beri-beri]] in people subsisting on polished rice. Removing the outer layer of rice by polishing it removes with it the essential vitamin [[thiamine]], causing beri-beri. Another example is the development of [[scurvy]] among infants in the late 19th century in the United States. It turned out that the vast majority of sufferers were being fed milk that had been heat-treated (as suggested by [[Louis Pasteur|Pasteur]]) to control bacterial disease. Pasteurisation was effective against bacteria, but it destroyed the vitamin C.

As mentioned, lifestyle- and obesity-related diseases are becoming increasingly prevalent all around the world. There is little doubt that the increasingly widespread application of some modern food processing technologies has contributed to this development. The food processing industry is a major part of modern economy, and as such it is influential in political decisions (e.g., nutritional recommendations, agricultural subsidising). In any known profit-driven economy, health considerations are hardly a priority; effective production of cheap foods with a long shelf-life is more the trend. In general, whole, fresh foods have a relatively short shelf-life and are less profitable to produce and sell than are more processed foods. Thus, the consumer is left with the choice between more expensive, but nutritionally superior, whole, fresh foods, and cheap, usually nutritionally inferior, processed foods. Because processed foods are often cheaper, more convenient (in both purchasing, storage, and preparation), and more available, the consumption of nutritionally inferior foods has been increasing throughout the world along with many nutrition-related health complications.

'''Osipkov–Merritt models''' (named for Leonid Osipkov and [[David Merritt]]) are mathematical representations of spherical stellar systems ([[galaxies]], [[star clusters]], [[globular clusters]] etc.).  The Osipkov–Merritt formula generates a one-parameter family of [[phase-space]] [[Distribution function (physics)|distribution function]]s that reproduce a specified density profile (representing stars) in a specified gravitational potential (in which the stars move). The density and potential need not be self-consistently related.  
A free parameter adjusts the degree of velocity anisotropy, from [[isotropic]] to completely [[wikt:radial|radial]] motions.  The method is a generalization of [[Eddington's formula]]&lt;ref&gt;[[Arthur Eddington|Eddington, A.]] (1916), [http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1916MNRAS..76..572E  The distribution of stars in globular clusters,] ''Mon. Not. R. Astron. Soc.'', '''76''', 572&lt;/ref&gt;  for constructing isotropic spherical models.

The method was derived independently by its two eponymous discoverers.&lt;ref&gt;Osipkov, L. P. (1979), [http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1979PAZh....5...77O  Spherical systems of gravitating bodies with an ellipsoidal velocity distribution,] ''Pis'ma v Astron. Zhur.'', '''5''', 77&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Merritt"&gt;[[David Merritt|Merritt, D.]] (1985), [http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1985AJ.....90.1027M  Spherical stellar systems with spheroidal velocity distributions,] ''Astron. J.'', '''90''', 1027&lt;/ref&gt; The latter derivation includes two additional families of models (Type IIa, b) with tangentially anisotropic motions.

==Derivation==

According to [[Jeans's theorem]], the [[phase-space]] density of stars ''f'' must be expressible in terms of the isolating [[integrals of motion]], which in a spherical stellar system are the [[energy]] ''E'' and the [[angular momentum]] ''J''. The Osipkov-Merritt ''[[ansatz]]'' is

:&lt;math&gt;f = f(Q) = f(E+J^2/2r_a^2)&lt;/math&gt;

where ''r&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt;'', the "anisotropy radius", is a free parameter. This ''ansatz'' implies that ''f'' is constant on spheroids in velocity space since
:&lt;math&gt;
2Q = v_r^2 + (1+r^2/r_a^2)v_t^2 + 2\Phi(r)
&lt;/math&gt;
where ''v''&lt;sub&gt;r&lt;/sub&gt;, ''v''&lt;sub&gt;t&lt;/sub&gt; are velocity components parallel and perpendicular to the radius vector ''r'' and Φ(''r'') is the [[gravitational potential]].

The density ''ρ'' is the integral over velocities of ''f'':
:&lt;math&gt;
\rho(r) = 2\pi\int\int f(E,J) v_t dv_t dv_r
&lt;/math&gt;
which can be written
:&lt;math&gt;
\rho(r) = {2\pi\over r^2} \int_\Phi^0 dQ f(Q) \int_0^{2r^2(Q-\Phi)/(1+r^2/r_a^2)} dJ^2\left[2(Q-\Phi)-(J^2/r^2)(1+r^2/r_a^2)\right]^{-1/2}
&lt;/math&gt;

or

:&lt;math&gt;
\rho(r) = {4\pi\over 1+r^2/r_a^2} \int_\Phi^0 dQ \sqrt{2(Q-\Phi)}f(Q).
&lt;/math&gt;

This equation has the form of an [[Abel integral equation]] and can be inverted to give ''f'' in terms of ''ρ'':

:&lt;math&gt;

f(Q) = {\sqrt{2}\over 4\pi^2} {d\over dQ} \int_Q^0 {d\Phi\over\sqrt{\Phi-Q}} {d\rho^'\over d\Phi},\ \ \ \ \ \rho^'(\Phi) = \left[1+r(\Phi)^2/r_a^2\right]\rho\left[r(\Phi)\right].
&lt;/math&gt;

==Properties==

Following a derivation similar to the one above, the velocity dispersions in an Osipkov–Merritt model satisfy

:&lt;math&gt;
{\sigma_r^2\over\sigma_t^2} = 1 + {r^2\over r_a^2}.
&lt;/math&gt;

The motions are nearly radial (&lt;math&gt;\sigma_r\gg\sigma_t&lt;/math&gt;) for &lt;math&gt;r\gg r_a&lt;/math&gt; and nearly isotropic (&lt;math&gt;\sigma_r\approx\sigma_t&lt;/math&gt;) for &lt;math&gt;r\ll r_a&lt;/math&gt;.  This is a desirable feature, since stellar systems that form via [[gravitational collapse]] have isotropic cores and radially-anisotropic envelopes.&lt;ref&gt;van Albada, T. (1983), [http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1982MNRAS.201..939V  Dissipationless galaxy formation and the R to the 1/4-power law,] ''Mon. Not. R. Astron. Soc.'', '''201''', 939&lt;/ref&gt;

If ''r&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt;'' is assigned too small a value, ''f'' may be negative for some ''Q''. This is a consequence of the fact that spherical mass models can not always be reproduced by purely radial orbits.  Since the number of stars on an orbit can not be negative, values of ''r&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt;'' that generate negative ''f'''s are unphysical. This result can be used to constrain the maximum degree of anisotropy of spherical galaxy models.&lt;ref name=Merritt/&gt;

In his 1985 paper, Merritt defined two additional families of models ("Type II") that have isotropic cores and tangentially anisotropic envelopes.  Both families assume

:&lt;math&gt;f = f(E-J^2/2r_a^2)&lt;/math&gt;.

In Type IIa models, the orbits become completely circular at ''r=r&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt;'' and remain so at all larger radii.
In Type IIb models, stars beyond ''r&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt;'' move on orbits of various eccentricities, although the motion is always biased toward circular. In both families, the tangential velocity dispersion undergoes a jump as ''r'' increases past ''r&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt;''.

[[C. Marcella Carollo|C. M. Carollo]] ''et al.'' (1995)&lt;ref&gt;Carollo, C. M. ''et al.'' (1995), [http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1995MNRAS.276.1131C  Velocity profiles of Osipkov-Merritt models,] ''Mon. Not. R. Astron.

The term persona is used widely in online and technology applications as well as in advertising, where other terms such as ''pen portraits'' may also be used.

Personas are useful in considering the goals, desires, and limitations of [[brand]] buyers and users in order to help to guide decisions about a service, product or interaction space such as features, interactions, and visual design of a website.  Personas may also be used as part of a [[user-centered design]] process for designing [[software]] and are also considered a part of [[Interaction design|interaction design (IxD)]], having been used in [[industrial design]] and more recently for online marketing purposes.

A user persona is a representation of the goals and behavior of a hypothesized group of [[user (system)|user]]s. In most cases, personas are synthesized from data collected from interviews with users &lt;ref&gt;Humphrey, Aaron (2017), {{cite web |title=User Personas and Social Media Profiles |url=https://ojs.deakin.edu.au/index.php/ps/article/view/708 |website=Persona Studies journal}},''Persona Studies'' Vol. 3, No. 2, pp. 13-20.&lt;/ref&gt;. They are captured in 1–2-page descriptions that include behavior patterns, goals, skills, attitudes, and the environment, with a few fictional personal details to make the persona a realistic character. Personas are also widely used in sales, advertising, marketing and system design, Personas provide common behaviors, outlooks, and potential objections of people  inherent to a given persona. 

==History==

Within the software design domain, [[Alan Cooper]], a noted pioneer software developer, proposed the concept of a ''user'' ''persona.'' Beginning in 1983, he started using a prototype of what the persona would become using data from informal interviews with seven to eight users.&lt;ref name="Cooper1983"&gt;{{citation |last=Goodwin|first=Kim |title=Designing for the Digital Age |publisher=Wiley Publishing, Inc. |date=2009 |isbn=978-0-470-22910-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; From 1995, he became engaged with how a specific rather than generalized user would use and interface with the software. The technique was popularized for the online business and technology community in his 1999 book ''The Inmates are Running the Asylum''. In this book, Cooper outlines the general characteristics, uses and best practices for creating personas, recommending that software be designed for single archetypal users.&lt;ref name="Cooper1999"&gt;{{citation |last=Cooper|first=Alan |title=The Inmates are Running the Asylum |publisher=SAMS |date=1999 |isbn=0-672-31649-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The concept of understanding customer segments as communities with coherent identity was developed in 1993-4 by Angus Jenkinson&lt;ref&gt;Jenkinson, A. (1994) ‘Beyond segmentation’, Journal of Targeting, Measurement and Analysis for Marketing, Vol. 3, No. 1, pp. 60–72&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Jenkinson, A. (1995) Valuing Your Customers, From quality information to quality relationships through database marketing, McGraw Hill, Maidenhead, England&lt;/ref&gt; and internationally adopted by OgilvyOne with clients using the name CustomerPrints as "day-in-the-life archetype descriptions".&lt;ref&gt;Jenkinson, A. (2009) What happened to strategic segmentation? Journal of Direct, Data, and Digital Marketing Practice (2009) 11:2, 124-139. {{doi|10.1057/dddmp.2009.27}} Palgrave Macmillan, Basingstoke UK&lt;/ref&gt; Creating imaginal or fictional characters to represent these customer segments or communities followed. Jenkinson's approach was to describe an imaginal character in their real interface, behavior and attitudes with the brand, and the idea was initially realized with Michael Jacobs in a series of studies. In 1997 the Ogilvy global knowledge management system, Truffles, described the concept as follows: "Each strong brand has a tribe of people who share affinity with the brand’s values. This universe typically divides into a number of different communities within which there are the same or very similar buying behaviours, and whose personality and characteristics towards the brand (product or service) can be understood in terms of common values, attitudes and assumptions. CustomerPrints are descriptions that capture the living essence of these distinct groups of customers."&lt;ref&gt;Jenkinson, A (1997) CustomerPrints: Defining the Essentials of the Consumer: The essential guide to what CustomerPrints are, why and how to do them and even how to use them. Truffles. OgilvyOne&lt;/ref&gt;

==Benefits==
According to Pruitt and Adlin, the use of personas offers several benefits in [[product development]].&lt;ref name="pruittadlin"&gt;Pruitt, John &amp; Adlin, Tamara. ''The Persona Lifecycle: Keeping People in Mind Throughout Product Design''.  Morgan Kaufmann, 2006.  {{ISBN|0-12-566251-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;cf. {{harvnb|Grudin|Pruitt|2002}}; {{harvnb|Cooper|1999}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Personas are said to be cognitively compelling because they put a personal human face on otherwise abstract data about customers. By thinking about the needs of a fictional persona, designers may be better able to infer what a real person might need. Such inference may assist with brainstorming, use case specification, and features definition. Pruitt and Adlin argue that personas are easy to communicate to engineering teams and thus allow engineers, developers, and others to absorb customer data in a palatable format.  They present several examples of personas used for purposes of communication in various development projects.&lt;ref name="pruittadlin"/&gt;

Personas also help prevent some common design pitfalls which may otherwise be easy to fall into. The first is designing for what Cooper calls "The Elastic User" — by which he means that while making product decisions different [[Stakeholder theory|stakeholders]] may define the 'user' according to their convenience. Defining personas helps the team have a shared understanding of the real users in terms of their goals, capabilities, and contexts. Personas also help prevent "self-referential design" when the designer or developer may unconsciously project their own mental models on the product design which may be very different from that of the target user population. Personas also provide a reality check by helping designers keep the focus of the design on cases that are most likely to be encountered for the target users and not on edge cases which usually won't happen for the target population. According to Cooper, edge cases which should naturally be handled properly should not become the design focus.&lt;ref name=Cooper1999/&gt;

The benefits are summarized as:
* Help team members share a specific, consistent understanding of various audience groups. Data about the groups can be put in a proper context and can be understood and remembered in coherent stories.
* Proposed solutions can be guided by how well they meet the needs of individual user personas. Features can be prioritized based on how well they address the needs of one or more personas.
* Provide a human "face" so as to create empathy for the persons represented by the demographics.&lt;ref name=Cooper1999/&gt;

==Data Collection==

Concerning data, personas have typically been developed from surveys, focus groups, and other ethnographic data collection techniques. Most persona designers believe that personas should be based on ethnographic or other data collection approaches concerning customers and should not be based purely on the creator's imagination. The use of ethnographic research helps the creation of a number of archetype users that can be used to develop products that deliver positive user experiences. With the availability of large amounts of actual customer data, user data, social media data, and other web analytics data, personas derived from actual user/customer data.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Jung|first=Soon-gyo|last2=An|first2=Jisun|last3=Kwak|first3=Haewoon|last4=Ahmad|first4=Mooed|last5=Nielsen|first5=Lene|last6=Jansen|first6=Bernard|date=2017|title=Persona Generation from Aggregated Social Media Data|url=http://www.bernardjjansen.com/uploads/2/4/1/8/24188166/jjansen_personas_chi2017.pdf|journal=ACM Conference Extended Abstracts on Human Factors in Computing Systems 2017 (CHI2017)|volume=|pages=1748-1755|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Criticism ==

Criticism of personas falls into three general categories: analysis of the underlying logic, concerns about practical implementation, and [[empirical|empirical results]].&lt;ref&gt;cf. {{harvnb|Chapman|Milham|2006}}; {{harvnb|Rönkkö|2005}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

In terms of scientific logic, it has been argued that because personas are fictional, they have no clear relationship to real customer data and therefore cannot be considered scientific.&lt;ref&gt;Köhler, T. (2001). Methoden der Analyse computervermittelter Kommunikation: ein kritischer Überblick; In: Frindte, W., Köhler, T., Marquet, P. &amp; Nissen, E.: IN-TELE 99 - Internet-based teaching and learning 99. Peter Lang Verlag, Frankfurt am Main.&lt;/ref&gt; Chapman and Milham described the purported flaws in considering personas as a scientific research method.&lt;ref name="chapman"&gt;{{citation| last1=Chapman|first1=CN |last2=Milham|first2=R |contribution=The personas' new clothes |title=Human Factors and Ergonomics Society (HFES) 2006 |location=San Francisco, CA |date=October 2006 |url=http://cnchapman.files.wordpress.com/2007/03/chapman-milham-personas-hfes2006-0139-0330.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; They argued that there is no procedure to work reliably from given data to specific personas, and thus such a process is not subject to the scientific method of reproducible research. However, in the age of abundant individual user data, there still is an apparent role for the use of personas, although the use may vary from their traditional employment.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Salminen|first=Joni|last2=Kwak|first2=Haewoon|last3=An|first3=Jisun|last4=Jung|first4=Soon-gyo|last5=Jansen|first5=Bernard|date=2018|title=Are personas done?

== Scientific research ==
In empirical results, the research to date has offered soft metrics for the success of personas, such as anecdotal feedback from stakeholders. Rönkkö has described how team politics and other organizational issues led to limitations of the personas method in one set of projects.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|last=Rönkkö|first=K |contribution=An empirical study demonstrating how different design constraints, project organization, and contexts limited the utility of personas |title=Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences (HICSS) 2005 |location=Waikoloa, HI, USA |date=January 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; Chapman, Love, Milham, Elrif, and Alford have demonstrated with survey data that descriptions with more than a few attributes (e.g., such as a persona) are likely to describe very few if any real people. They argued that personas cannot be assumed to be descriptive of actual customers.&lt;ref name="chapman2"&gt;{{citation |last1=Chapman|first1=CN |last2=Love|first2=E |last3=Milham|first3=RP |last4=ElRif|first4=P |last5=Alford|first5=JL |contribution=Quantitative evaluation of personas as information |title=Proceedings of the Human Factors and Ergonomics Society 52nd Annual Meeting |location=New York, NY |date=September 2008 |pages=1107–1111 |chapter-url=http://www.userphilosophy.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/02/reprint-hfes08-chapman-love-milham-elrif-alford.pdf|chapter-format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A study conducted by Long claimed support for Cooper, Pruitt ''et al.'' in the use of personas.&lt;ref name="long"&gt;{{citation |last=Long|first=Frank |contribution=Real or Imaginary: The Effectiveness of using Personas in Product Design |title=Proceedings of the Irish Ergonomics Society Annual Conference |date=May 2009 |pages=1–10 |location=Dublin |chapter-url=http://www.frontend.com/products-digital-devices/real-or-imaginary-the-effectiveness-of-using-personas-in-product-design.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a partially controlled study, a group of students were asked to solve a design brief; two groups used personas while one group did not. The students who used personas were awarded higher course evaluations than the group who did not. Students who used personas were assessed as having produced designs with better usability attributes than students who did not use personas. The study also suggests that using personas may improve communication between design teams and facilitate user-focused design discussion. The study had several limitations: outcomes were assessed by a professor and students who were not blind to the hypothesis, students were assigned to groups in a non-random fashion, the findings were not replicated, and other contributing factors or expectation effects (e.g., the [[Hawthorne effect]] or [[Pygmalion effect]]) were not controlled for.

[[File:PCB Spectrum.jpg|thumb|Part of a 1984 [[Sinclair Research|Sinclair]] [[ZX Spectrum]] computer board, a PCB, showing the conductive traces, [[via (electronics)|vias]] (the through-hole paths to the other surface), and some electronic components mounted using through-hole mounting.]]

A '''printed circuit board''' ('''PCB''') mechanically supports and electrically connects [[electronic components]] or [[electrical]] components using [[Electrical conductor|conductive]] tracks, pads and other features [[industrial etching|etch]]ed from one or more sheet layers of copper [[laminated]] onto and/or between sheet layers of a [[insulator (electricity)|non-conductive]] [[substrate (electronics)|substrate]]. Components are generally [[Soldering|soldered]] onto the PCB to both electrically connect and mechanically fasten them to it.

Printed circuit boards are used in all but the simplest electronic products. They are also used in some electrical products, such as passive switch boxes.

Alternatives to PCBs include [[wire wrap]] and [[point-to-point construction]], both once popular but now rarely used. PCBs require additional design effort to lay out the circuit, but manufacturing and assembly can be automated. Specialized CAD software is available to do much of the work of layout. Mass-producing circuits with PCBs is cheaper and faster than with other wiring methods, as components are mounted and wired in one operation.  Large numbers of PCBs can be fabricated at the same time, and the layout only has to be done once.  PCBs can also be made manually in small quantities, with reduced benefits.

PCBs can be single-sided (one copper layer), double-sided (two copper layers on both sides of one substrate layer), or multi-layer (outer and inner layers of copper, alternating with layers of substrate).  Multi-layer PCBs allow for much higher component density, because circuit traces on the inner layers would otherwise take up surface space between components.  The rise in popularity of multilayer PCBs with more than two, and especially with more than four, copper planes was concurrent with the adoption of [[surface mount technology]].  However, multilayer PCBs make repair, analysis, and field modification of circuits much more difficult and usually impractical.

The world market for bare PCBs exceeded $60.2 billion in 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.iconnect007.com/index.php/article/92973/world-pcb-production-in-2014-estimated-at-602b/92976/?skin=pcb|title=iconnect007 :: Article|website=www.iconnect007.com|access-date=2016-04-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2018, the Global Single Sided Printed Circuit Board Market Analysis Report estimated that the PCB market would reach $79 billion by 2024.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://globenewswire.com/news-release/2018/07/30/1543947/0/en/Global-Printed-Circuit-Board-PCB-Market-to-Witness-a-CAGR-of-3-1-during-2018-2024.html|title=Global Printed Circuit Board (PCB) Market to Witness a CAGR of 3.1% during 2018-2024|last=Research|first=Energias Market|work=GlobeNewswire News Room|access-date=2018-08-26|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://theindustryherald.com/2018/08/21/global-single-sided-printed-circuit-board-market-growth-future-prospects-and-competitive-analysis-and-forecast-2018-2023/|title=Global Single Sided Printed Circuit Board Market - Growth, Future Prospects and Competitive Analysis and Forecast 2018 - 2023 - The Industry Herald|date=2018-08-21|work=The Industry Herald|access-date=2018-08-26|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Before the development of printed circuit boards electrical and electronic circuits were [[point-to-point construction|wired point-to-point]] on a chassis. Typically, the chassis was a sheet metal frame or pan, sometimes with a wooden bottom. Components were attached to the chassis, usually by insulators when the connecting point on the chassis was metal, and then their leads were connected directly or with jumper wires by soldering, or sometimes using crimp connectors, wire connector lugs on screw terminals, or other methods. Circuits were large, bulky, heavy, and relatively fragile (even discounting the breakable glass envelopes of the vacuum tubes that were often included in the circuits), and production was labor-intensive, so the products were expensive.

Development of the methods used in modern printed circuit boards started early in the 20th century. In 1903, a German inventor, Albert Hanson, described flat foil conductors laminated to an insulating board, in multiple layers. [[Thomas Edison]] experimented with chemical methods of plating conductors onto linen paper in 1904. Arthur Berry in 1913 patented a print-and-etch method in the UK, and in the United States Max Schoop obtained a patent&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite patent|US|1256599}}&lt;/ref&gt; to flame-spray metal onto a board through a patterned mask. Charles Ducas in 1927 patented a method of electroplating circuit patterns.&lt;ref name="Harper03"&gt;Charles A. Harper, ''Electronic materials and processes handbook'', McGraw-Hill,2003 {{ISBN|0-07-140214-4}}, pages 7.3 and 7.4&lt;/ref&gt;

The Austrian engineer [[Paul Eisler]] invented the printed circuit as part of a [[radio]] set while working in the UK around 1936. In 1941 a multi-layer printed circuit was used in German magnetic influence naval mines. Around 1943 the USA began to use the technology on a large scale to make [[proximity fuse]]s for use in [[World War II]].&lt;ref name="Harper03" /&gt; After the war, in 1948, the USA released the invention for commercial use. Printed circuits did not become commonplace in consumer electronics until the mid-1950s, after the ''Auto-Sembly'' process was developed by the [[United States Army]]. At around the same time in the UK work along similar lines was carried out by [[Geoffrey Dummer]], then at the [[Royal Radar Establishment|RRDE]].

Even as circuit boards became available, the point-to-point chassis construction method remained in common use in industry (such as TV and hi-fi sets) into at least the late 1960s. Printed circuit boards were introduced to  reduce the size, weight, and cost of parts of the circuitry. In 1960, a small consumer radio receiver might be built with all its circuitry on one circuit board, but a TV set would probably contain  one or more circuit boards.

[[File:Hand Etched PCB.png|thumb|An example of hand-drawn etched traces on a PCB]]

Predating the printed circuit invention, and similar in spirit, was [[John Sargrove]]'s 1936–1947 Electronic Circuit Making Equipment (ECME) which sprayed metal onto a [[Bakelite]] plastic board. The ECME could produce three radio boards per minute.

During World War II, the development of the anti-aircraft [[proximity fuse]] required an electronic circuit that could withstand being fired from a gun, and could be produced in quantity. The Centralab Division of Globe Union submitted a proposal which met the requirements: a ceramic plate would be [[screenprinting|screenprinted]] with metallic paint for conductors and carbon material for [[resistor]]s, with ceramic disc capacitors and subminiature vacuum tubes soldered in place.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| last = Brunetti| first = Cledo | authorlink = | coauthors = | title = New Advances in Printed Circuits | publisher = National Bureau of Standards | date = 22 November 1948 | location = Washington DC | pages = | url = | doi = | id = | isbn = }}&lt;/ref&gt; The technique proved viable, and the resulting patent on the process, which was classified by the U.S. Army, was assigned to Globe Union. It was not until 1984 that the [[Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers|Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE)]] awarded Mr. Harry W. Rubinstein the [[IEEE Cledo Brunetti Award|Cledo Brunetti Award]] for early key contributions to the development of printed components and conductors on a common insulating substrate.  Mr. Rubinstein was honored in 1984 by his alma mater, the [[University of Wisconsin–Madison|University of Wisconsin-Madison]], for his innovations in the technology of printed electronic circuits and the fabrication of capacitors.&lt;ref&gt;Engineers' Day, [https://www.engr.wisc.edu/engage/alumni-relations/our-distinguished-alumni/ 1984 Award Recipients], College of Engineering, [[University of Wisconsin–Madison|University of Wisconsin-Madison]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="IEEE_Recipient_list"&gt;{{web cite|title=IEEE CLEDO BRUNETTI AWARD RECIPIENTS|url=https://www.ieee.org/content/dam/ieee-org/ieee/web/org/about/awards/recipients/brunetti_rl.pdf|publisher=[[IEEE]]|access-date=2018-08-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; This invention also represents a step in the development of [[integrated circuit]] technology, as not only wiring but also passive components were fabricated on the ceramic substrate.

[[File:PCB design and realisation smt and through hole.png|thumb|A PCB as a design on a computer (left) and realized as a board assembly populated with components (right). The board is double sided, with through-hole plating, green solder resist and a white legend. Both surface mount and through-hole components have been used.]]

Originally, every electronic component had wire leads, and a PCB had holes drilled for each wire of each component. The component leads were then inserted through the holes and [[solder]]ed to the copper PCB traces. This method of assembly is called [[Through-hole technology|''through-hole'' construction]]. In 1949, Moe Abramson and Stanislaus F. Danko of the [[United States Army Signal Corps]] developed the ''Auto-Sembly'' process in which component leads were inserted into a copper foil interconnection pattern and [[Dip soldering|dip soldered]]. The patent they obtained in 1956 was assigned to the U.S. Army.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite patent|US|2756485}} assigned to US Army. July 31, 1956.&lt;/ref&gt; With the development of board lamination and etching techniques, this concept evolved into the standard printed circuit board fabrication process in use today. Soldering could be done automatically by passing the board over a ripple, or wave, of molten solder in a [[Wave soldering|wave-soldering]] machine. However, the wires and holes are inefficient since drilling holes is expensive and consumes drill bits and the protruding wires are cut off and discarded.

From the 1980s onward, small surface mount parts have been used increasingly instead of through-hole components; this has led to smaller boards for a given functionality and lower production costs, but with some additional difficulty in servicing faulty boards.

In the 1990s the use of multilayer surface boards became more frequent. As a result, size was further minimized and both flexible and rigid PCBs were incorporated in different devices. In 1995 PCB manufacturers began using microvia technology to produce High-Density Interconnect (HDI) PCBs.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://falconerelectronics.com/history-of-circuit-boards/|title=History of Circuit Boards Through the 20th Century|date=2017-08-18|work=Falconer Electronics|access-date=2018-08-26|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{US patent reference | number = 5434751 | issue-date = 18 July 1995 | inventor = Herbert S. Cole, Jr., Theresa A. Sitnik-Nieters, Robert J. Wojnarowski, John H. Lupinski | title = Reworkable high density interconnect structure incorporating a release layer}}&lt;/ref&gt;

HDI technology allows for a denser design on the PCB and significantly smaller components. As a result, components can be closer and the paths between them shorter. HDIs use blind/buried vias, or a combination that includes microvias. With multi-layer HDI PCBs the interconnection of stacked vias is even stronger, thus enhancing reliability in all conditions. The most common applications for HDI technology are computer and mobile phone components as well as medical equipment and military communication equipment. A 4-layer HDI microvia PCB Cost is equivalent in quality to an 8-layer through-hole PCB. However, the cost is much lower.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.creativehitech.com/blog/rise-high-density-interconnect-pcbs/|title=The Rise of High Density Interconnect PCBs - HDI PCBs|website=www.creativehitech.com|language=en-US|access-date=2018-08-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.manufacturing.net/blog/2017/10/4-new-technologies-changing-pcb-market|title=4 New Technologies Changing The PCB Market|date=2017-10-26|work=Manufacturing.net|access-date=2018-08-26|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Recent advances in 3D printing have meant that there are several new techniques in PCB creation. 3D printed electronics (PEs) can be utilized to print items layer by layer and subsequently the item can be printed with a liquid ink that contains electronic functionalities.

Manufacturers may not support component-level repair of printed circuit boards because of the relatively low cost to replace compared with the time and cost of troubleshooting to a component level. In board-level repair, the technician identifies the board (PCA) on which the fault resides and replaces it. This shift is economically efficient from a manufacturer's point of view but is also materially wasteful, as a circuit board with hundreds of good components may be discarded and replaced due to the failure of one minor and inexpensive part such as a resistor or capacitor. This practice is a significant contributor to the problem of [[e-waste]].{{citation needed|date=December 2017}}

==Overview==
A basic PCB consists of a flat sheet of insulating material and a layer of copper foil, laminated to the substrate. Chemical etching divides the copper into separate conducting lines called tracks or ''circuit traces'', pads for connections, vias to pass connections between layers of copper, and features such as solid conductive areas for EM shielding or other purposes. The tracks function as wires fixed in place, and are insulated from each other by air and the board substrate material.  The surface of a PCB may have a coating that protects the copper from corrosion and reduces the chances of solder shorts between traces or undesired electrical contact with stray bare wires. For its function in helping to prevent solder shorts, the coating is called solder resist.

A printed circuit board can have multiple copper layers.  A two-layer board has copper on both sides; multi layer boards sandwich additional copper layers between layers of insulating material. Conductors on different layers are connected with [[via (electronics)|vias]], which are copper-plated holes that function as electrical tunnels through the insulating substrate. Through-hole component leads sometimes also effectively function as vias.  After two-layer PCBs, the next step up is usually four-layer. Often two layers are dedicated as power supply and ground planes, and the other two are used for signal wiring between components.

"Through hole" components are mounted by their wire leads passing through the board and soldered to traces on the other side. "Surface mount" components are attached by their leads to copper traces on the same side of the board.  A board may use both methods for mounting components. PCBs with only through-hole mounted components are now uncommon. Surface mounting is used for transistors, diodes, IC chips, resistors and capacitors. Through-hole mounting may be used for some large components such as electrolytic capacitors and connectors.

The  pattern to be etched into each copper layer of a PCB is called the "artwork".  The etching is usually done using [[photoresist]] which is coated onto the PCB, then exposed to light projected in the pattern of the artwork. The resist material protects the copper from dissolution into the etching solution.  The etched board is then cleaned. A PCB design can be mass-reproduced in a way similar to the way photographs can be mass-duplicated from film negatives using a photographic printer.

In multi-layer boards, the layers of material are laminated together in an alternating sandwich: copper, substrate, copper, substrate, copper, etc.; each plane of copper is etched, and any internal vias (that will not extend to both outer surfaces of the finished multilayer board) are plated-through, before the layers are laminated together. Only the outer layers need be coated; the inner copper layers are protected by the adjacent substrate layers.

[[FR-4]] [[Fibre-reinforced plastic|glass epoxy]] is the most common insulating substrate. Another substrate material is cotton paper impregnated with phenolic resin, often tan or brown.

When a PCB has no components installed, it is less ambiguously called a ''printed wiring board'' (''PWB'') or ''etched wiring board''. However, the term "printed wiring board" has fallen into disuse. A PCB populated with electronic components is called a ''printed circuit assembly'' (''PCA''), ''printed circuit board assembly'' or ''PCB assembly'' (''PCBA''). In informal usage, the term "printed circuit board" most commonly means "printed circuit assembly" (with components). The [[IPC (electronics)|IPC]] preferred term for assembled boards is ''circuit card assembly'' (''CCA''),&lt;ref&gt;IPC-14.38&lt;/ref&gt; and for assembled [[backplane]]s it is ''backplane assemblies''. "Card" is another widely used informal term for a "printed circuit assembly".

A PCB may be "silkscreen" printed with a legend  identifying the components, test points, or identifying text. Originally, an actual silkscreen printing process was used for this purpose, but today other, finer quality printing methods are usually used instead.  Normally the screen printing is not significant to the function of the PCBA.

A minimal PCB for a single component, used for prototyping, is called a ''breakout board''. The purpose of a breakout board is to "break out" the leads of a component on separate terminals so that manual connections to them can be made easily. Breakout boards are especially used for surface-mount components or any components with fine lead pitch.

Advanced PCBs may contain components embedded in the substrate.{{citation needed|date=December 2017}}

==Characteristics==
===Through-hole technology===
{{Main article|Through-hole technology}}
[[File:Resistors (1).jpg|thumb|Through-hole (leaded) resistors]]

The first PCBs used through-hole technology, mounting electronic components by [[Lead (electronics)|lead]]s inserted through holes on one side of the board and soldered onto copper traces on the other side. Boards may be single-sided, with an unplated component side, or more compact double-sided boards, with components soldered on both sides.  Horizontal installation of through-hole parts with two axial leads (such as resistors, capacitors, and diodes) is done by bending the leads 90 degrees in the same direction, inserting the part in the board (often bending leads located on the back of the board in opposite directions to improve the part's mechanical strength), soldering the leads, and trimming off the ends. Leads may be [[Soldering|soldered]] either manually or by a [[wave soldering]] machine.&lt;ref name= MAT2001&gt;''Electronic Packaging:Solder Mounting Technologies'' in K.H. Buschow et al (ed), ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=TyVVAAAAMAAJ Encyclopedia of Materials:Science and Technology]'', Elsevier, 2001 {{ISBN|0-08-043152-6}},  pages 2708–2709&lt;/ref&gt;

Through-hole manufacture adds to board cost by requiring many holes to be drilled accurately, and it limits the available routing area for [[signal trace]]s on layers immediately below the top layer on multi-layer boards, since the holes must pass through all layers to the opposite side. Once surface-mounting came into use, small-sized SMD components were used where possible, with through-hole mounting only of components unsuitably large for surface-mounting due to power requirements or mechanical limitations, or subject to mechanical stress which might damage the PCB (e.g. by lifting the copper off the board surface).{{citation needed|date=May 2017}}

===Surface-mount technology===
{{Main article|Surface-mount technology}}
[[File:Surface Mount Components.jpg|thumb|Surface mount components, including resistors, [[transistor]]s and an integrated circuit]]

Surface-mount technology emerged in the 1960s, gained momentum in the early 1980s and became widely used by the mid-1990s.
Components were mechanically redesigned to have small metal tabs or end caps that could be soldered directly onto the PCB surface, instead of wire leads to pass through holes.  Components became much smaller and component placement on both sides of the board became more common than with through-hole mounting, allowing much smaller PCB assemblies with much higher circuit densities.
Surface mounting lends itself well to a high degree of automation, reducing labor costs and greatly increasing production rates.  Components can be supplied mounted on carrier tapes. Surface mount components can be about one-quarter to one-tenth of the size and weight of through-hole components, and passive components much cheaper.  However, prices of semiconductor [[surface mount device]]s (SMDs) are determined more by the chip itself than the package, with little price advantage over larger packages, and some wire-ended components, such as [[1N4148 signal diode|1N4148]] small-signal switch diodes, are actually significantly cheaper than SMD equivalents.

===Circuit properties of the PCB===
Each trace consists of a flat, narrow part of the [[copper]] foil that remains after etching. Its [[electrical resistance|resistance]], determined by its width, thickness, and length, must be sufficiently low for the current the conductor will carry. Power and ground traces may need to be wider than signal traces. In a multi-layer board one entire layer may be mostly solid copper to act as a [[ground plane]] for shielding and power return. For [[microwave]] circuits, [[transmission line]]s can be laid out in [[planar transmission line|a planar form]] such as [[stripline]] or [[microstrip]] with carefully controlled dimensions to assure a consistent [[Characteristic impedance|impedance]]. In radio-frequency and fast switching circuits the [[inductance]] and [[capacitance]] of the printed circuit board conductors become significant circuit elements, usually undesired; conversely, they can be used as a deliberate part of the circuit design, as in [[Distributed element filter]]s, obviating the need for additional discrete components.

===Materials===
====RoHS compliant PCB====

The European Union bans the use of lead (among other heavy metals) in consumer items, a piece of legislature called the [[RoHS]], for Restriction of Hazardous Substances, directive. PCBs to be sold in the EU must be RoHS-compliant, meaning that all manufacturing processes must not involve the use of lead, all solder used must be lead-free, and all components mounted on the board must be free of lead, mercury, cadmium, and other heavy metals.&lt;ref&gt;1.	“You Are HereDEQ Pollutants and Toxicants Environmental Lead (Pb).” DEQ - How Does Lead Affect Our Environment?, Agency: Environmental Quality, www.michigan.gov/deq/0,4561,7-135-3307_29693_30031-90418--,00.html. &lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;2.	“RoHS Guide.” RoHS Compliance Guide: FAQ on RoHS Compliance, www.rohsguide.com/rohs-faq.htm.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Laminates====
Laminates are manufactured by curing under pressure and temperature layers of cloth or paper with [[thermoset]] [[resin]] to form an integral final piece of uniform thickness. The size can be up to {{Convert|4|by|8|ft|m}} in width and length.  Varying cloth weaves (threads per inch or cm), cloth thickness, and resin percentage are used to achieve the desired final thickness and [[dielectric]] characteristics. Available standard laminate thickness are listed in
ANSI/IPC-D-275.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Design Standard for Rigid Printed Boards and Rigid Printed Board Assemblies|id=IPC-4101|publisher=IPC|date=September 1991}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The cloth or fiber material used, resin material, and the cloth to resin ratio determine the laminate's type designation (FR-4, CEM-1, G-10, etc.) and therefore the characteristics of the laminate produced. Important characteristics are the level to which the laminate is [[fire retardant]], the [[dielectric constant]] (e&lt;sub&gt;r&lt;/sub&gt;), the [[loss factor]] (tδ), the [[tensile strength]], the [[shear strength]], the [[glass transition temperature]] (T&lt;sub&gt;g&lt;/sub&gt;), and the Z-axis [[coefficient of expansion|expansion coefficient]] (how much the thickness changes with temperature).

There are quite a few different dielectrics that can be chosen to provide different insulating values depending on the requirements of the circuit. Some of these dielectrics are [[polytetrafluoroethylene]] (Teflon), FR-4, FR-1, CEM-1 or CEM-3. Well known pre-preg materials used in the PCB industry are [[FR-2]] (phenolic cotton paper), FR-3 (cotton paper and epoxy), [[FR-4]] (woven glass and epoxy), FR-5 (woven glass and epoxy), FR-6 (matte glass and polyester), G-10 (woven glass and epoxy), CEM-1 (cotton paper and epoxy), CEM-2 (cotton paper and epoxy), CEM-3 (non-woven glass and epoxy), CEM-4 (woven glass and epoxy), CEM-5 (woven glass and polyester). Thermal expansion is an important consideration especially with [[ball grid array]] (BGA) and naked die technologies, and glass fiber offers the best dimensional stability.

FR-4 is by far the most common material used today. The board stock with unetched copper on it is called "copper-clad laminate".

With decreasing size of board features and increasing frequencies, small nonhomogeneities like uneven distribution of fiberglass or other filler, thickness variations, and bubbles in the resin matrix, and the associated local variations in the dielectric constant, are gaining importance.

====Key substrate parameters====
The circuitboard substrates are usually dielectric composite materials. The composites contain a matrix (usually an epoxy resin) and a reinforcement (usually a woven, sometimes nonwoven, glass fibers, sometimes even paper), and in some cases a filler is added to the resin (e.g. ceramics; titanate ceramics can be used to increase the dielectric constant).

The reinforcement type defines two major classes of materials: woven and non-woven. Woven reinforcements are cheaper, but the high dielectric constant of glass may not be favorable for many higher-frequency applications. The spatially nonhomogeneous structure also introduces local variations in electrical parameters, due to different resin/glass ratio at different areas of the weave pattern. Nonwoven reinforcements, or materials with low or no reinforcement, are more expensive but more suitable for some RF/analog applications.

The substrates are characterized by several key parameters, chiefly thermomechanical ([[glass transition temperature]], [[tensile strength]], [[shear strength]], [[thermal expansion]]), electrical ([[dielectric constant]], [[loss tangent]], [[breakdown voltage|dielectric breakdown voltage]], [[leakage current]], [[tracking resistance]]...), and others (e.g. [[moisture absorption]]).

At the [[glass transition temperature]] the resin in the composite softens and significantly increases thermal expansion; exceeding T&lt;sub&gt;g&lt;/sub&gt; then exerts mechanical overload on the board components - e.g. the joints and the vias. Below T&lt;sub&gt;g&lt;/sub&gt; the thermal expansion of the resin roughly matches copper and glass, above it gets significantly higher. As the reinforcement and copper confine the board along the plane, virtually all volume expansion projects to the thickness and stresses the plated-through holes. Repeated soldering or other exposition to higher temperatures can cause failure of the plating, especially with thicker boards; thick boards therefore require a matrix with a high T&lt;sub&gt;g&lt;/sub&gt;.

The materials used determine the substrate's dielectric constant. This constant is also dependent on frequency, usually decreasing with frequency. As this constant determines the [[phase velocity|signal propagation speed]], frequency dependence introduces phase distortion in wideband applications; as flat a dielectric constant vs frequency characteristics as is achievable is important here. The impedance of transmission lines decreases with frequency, therefore faster edges of signals reflect more than slower ones.

Dielectric breakdown voltage determines the maximum voltage gradient the material can be subjected to before suffering a breakdown (conduction, or arcing, through the dielectric).

Tracking resistance determines how the material resists high voltage electrical discharges creeping over the board surface.

Loss tangent determines how much of the electromagnetic energy from the signals in the conductors is absorbed in the board material. This factor is important for high frequencies. Low-loss materials are more expensive. Choosing unnecessarily low-loss material is a common engineering error in high-frequency digital design; it increases the cost of the boards without a corresponding benefit. Signal degradation by loss tangent and dielectric constant can be easily assessed by an [[eye pattern]].

Moisture absorption occurs when the material is exposed to high humidity or water. Both the resin and the reinforcement may absorb water; water also may be soaked by capillary forces through voids in the materials and along the reinforcement. Epoxies of the FR-4 materials aren't too susceptible, with absorption of only 0.15%. Teflon has very low absorption of 0.01%. Polyimides and cyanate esters, on the other side, suffer from high water absorption. Absorbed water can lead to significant degradation of key parameters; it impairs tracking resistance, breakdown voltage, and dielectric parameters. Relative dielectric constant of water is about 73, compared to about 4 for common circuit board materials. Absorbed moisture can also vaporize on heating, as during soldering, and cause cracking and delamination,&lt;ref&gt;Sood, B. and Pecht, M. 2011. Printed Circuit Board Laminates. Wiley Encyclopedia of Composites. 1–11.&lt;/ref&gt; the same effect responsible for "popcorning" damage on wet packaging of electronic parts. Careful baking of the substrates may be required to dry them prior to soldering.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=By Lee W.

====Common substrates====
Often encountered materials:
* [[FR-2]], [[phenolic paper]] or phenolic cotton paper, paper impregnated with a [[phenol formaldehyde resin]]. Common in consumer electronics with single-sided boards. Electrical properties inferior to FR-4. Poor arc resistance. Generally rated to 105&amp;nbsp;°C.

* [[Aluminum]], or ''metal core board'' or [[insulated metal substrate]] (IMS), clad with thermally conductive thin dielectric - used for parts requiring significant cooling - power switches, LEDs. Consists of usually single, sometimes double layer thin circuit board based on e.g. FR-4, laminated on aluminum sheet metal, commonly 0.8, 1, 1.5, 2 or 3&amp;nbsp;mm thick. The thicker laminates sometimes also come with thicker copper metalization.
* Flexible substrates - can be a standalone copper-clad foil or can be laminated to a thin stiffener, e.g. 50-130&amp;nbsp;µm

* [[Polyimide]], a high-temperature polymer. Expensive, high-performance. Higher water absorption (0.4%). Can be used from cryogenic temperatures to over 260&amp;nbsp;°C.

====Copper thickness====
Copper thickness of PCBs can be specified directly or as the weight of copper per area (in ounce per square foot) which is easier to measure. One [[ounce]] per [[square foot]] is 1.344 mils or 34 micrometers thickness. ''Heavy copper'' is a layer exceeding three ounces of copper per ft&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, or approximately 0.0042&amp;nbsp;inches (4.2&amp;nbsp;mils, 105&amp;nbsp;μm) thick.  Heavy copper layers are used for high current or  to help dissipate heat.

On the common FR-4 substrates, 1 [[Ounce|oz]] copper per ft&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; (35&amp;nbsp;µm) is the most common thickness; 2 oz (70&amp;nbsp;µm) and 0.5 oz (18&amp;nbsp;µm) thickness is often an option. Less common are 12 and 105&amp;nbsp;µm, 9&amp;nbsp;µm is sometimes available on some substrates. Flexible substrates typically have thinner metalization. Metal-core boards for high power devices commonly use thicker copper; 35&amp;nbsp;µm is usual but also 140 and 400&amp;nbsp;µm can be encountered.

====Safety certification (US)====
Safety Standard UL 796 covers component safety requirements for printed wiring boards for use as components in devices or appliances. Testing analyzes characteristics such as flammability, maximum [[operating temperature]], electrical tracking, heat deflection, and direct support of live electrical parts.

==Design==
&lt;!-- [[PCB design]] redirects here. --&gt;
[[File:S111FlipChipBack.jpg|thumb|A board designed in 1967; the sweeping curves in the traces are evidence of freehand design using adhesive tape]]

Initially PCBs were designed manually by creating a [[photomask]] on a clear [[mylar]] sheet, usually at two or four times the true size. Starting from the schematic diagram the component pin pads were laid out on the mylar and then traces were routed to connect the pads. Rub-on [[dry transfer]]s of common component footprints increased efficiency. Traces were made with self-adhesive tape. Pre-printed non-reproducing grids on the mylar assisted in layout. The finished photomask was [[Photolithography|photolithographically]] reproduced onto a photoresist coating on the blank copper-clad boards.

Modern PCBs are designed with dedicated layout software, generally in the following steps:&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cs.berkeley.edu/~prabal/teaching/cs194-05-s08/cs194-designflow.ppt Printed Circuit Board Design Flow Methodology]&lt;/ref&gt;
# [[Schematic capture]] through an [[electronic design automation]] (''EDA'') tool.
# Card dimensions and template are decided based on required circuitry and case of the PCB.
# The positions of the components and [[heat sink]]s are determined.
# Layer stack of the PCB is decided, with one to tens of layers depending on complexity. [[Ground plane|Ground]] and [[power plane]]s are decided. A power plane is the counterpart to a ground plane and behaves as an [[alternating current|AC]] signal ground while providing DC power to the circuits mounted on the PCB. Signal interconnections are traced on signal planes. Signal planes can be on the outer as well as inner layers. For optimal [[Electromagnetic interference|EMI]] performance high frequency signals are routed in internal layers between power or ground planes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lg-advice.ro/pdf/IPC-2251-cuprins.pdf|title=See appendix D of IPC-2251|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
# [[Line impedance]] is determined using dielectric layer thickness, routing copper thickness and trace-width. Trace separation is also taken into account in case of differential signals. [[Microstrip]], [[stripline]] or dual stripline can be used to route signals.
# Components are placed. Thermal considerations and geometry are taken into account. [[Via (electronics)|Via]]s and lands are marked.
# [[Signal trace]]s are [[routing (electronic design automation)|routed]]. Electronic design automation tools usually create clearances and connections in power and ground planes automatically.
# [[Gerber file]]s are generated for manufacturing.

==Manufacturing==
{{anchor|pcbmanufac}}

PCB manufacturing consists of many steps.

===PCB CAM===
Manufacturing starts from the fabrication data generated by [[computer aided design]], and component information. The  fabrication data is read into the CAM (Computer Aided Manufacturing) software. CAM performs the following functions:

# Input of the fabrication data.
# Verification of the data
# Compensation for deviations in the manufacturing processes (e.g. scaling to compensate for distortions during lamination)
# Panelization
# Output of the digital tools (copper patterns, drill files, inspection, and others)

===Panelization===
Several small printed circuit boards can be grouped together for processing as a panel. A panel consisting of a design duplicated ''n''-times is also called an ''n''-panel, whereas a ''multi-panel'' combines several different design onto a single panel. The outer tooling strip often includes [[tooling hole]]s, a set of [[panel fiducial]]s, a [[test coupon (PCB)|test coupon]], and may include [[hatched copper pour]] or similar patterns for even copper distribution over the whole panel in order to avoid bending. The assemblers often mount components on panels rather than single PCBs because this is efficient.

The panel is eventually broken into individual PCBs along perforations or grooves in the panel.&lt;ref&gt;Kraig Mitzner, ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=z7RCh8bK6_8C Complete PCB Design Using OrCad Capture and Layout]'', pages 443–446, Newnes, 2011 {{ISBN|0080549209}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Today depaneling is often done by lasers which cut the board with no contact. Laser depaneling reduces stress on the fragile circuits, improving the yield of defect-free units.

===Copper patterning===
The first step is to replicate the pattern in the fabricator's CAM system on a protective mask on the copper foil PCB layers.  Subsequent etching removes the unwanted copper. (Alternatively, a conductive ink can be ink-jetted on a blank (non-conductive) board. This technique is also used in the manufacture of [[hybrid circuit]]s.)
# '''[[Silk screen|Silk screen printing]]''' uses etch-resistant inks to create the protective mask.
# '''[[Photoengraving]]''' uses a photomask and developer to selectively remove a UV-sensitive photoresist coating and thus create a photoresist mask. Direct imaging techniques are sometimes used for high-resolution requirements. Experiments were made with thermal resist.&lt;ref name="Thermal DI"&gt;{{cite web
 |title=Liquid Photoresists for Thermal Direct Imaging
 |authors=Itshak Taff, Hai Benron
 |publisher=The Board Authority, October 1999
}}&lt;/ref&gt;
# '''[[PCB Milling|PCB milling]]''' uses a two or three-axis mechanical milling system to mill away the copper foil from the substrate. A PCB milling machine (referred to as a 'PCB Prototyper') operates in a similar way to a [[plotter]], receiving commands from the host software that control the position of the milling head in the x, y, and (if relevant) z axis.
# '''Laser resist ablation''' Spray black paint onto copper clad laminate, place into [[CNC]] laser plotter. The laser raster-scans the PCB and ablates (vaporizes) the paint where no resist is wanted. (Note: laser copper ablation is rarely used and is considered experimental.{{Clarify|date=April 2012|reason=is laser COPPER ablation distinct from resist ablation, and experimental?}})
# '''Laser etching''' The copper may be removed directly by a CNC laser.  Like PCB milling above this is used mainly for prototyping.

The method chosen depends on the  number of boards to be produced and the required resolution.

====Large volume====
* Silk screen printing – Used for PCBs with bigger features
* Photoengraving – Used when finer features are required

====Small volume====
* Print onto transparent film and use as photo mask along with photo-sensitized boards, then etch. (Alternatively, use a film photoplotter)
* Laser resist ablation
* PCB milling
* Laser etching

====Hobbyist====
* Laser-printed resist: Laser-print onto toner transfer paper, heat-transfer with an iron or modified laminator onto bare laminate, soak in water bath, touch up with a marker, then etch.
* Vinyl film and resist, non-washable marker, some other methods. Labor-intensive, only suitable for single boards.

===Subtractive, additive and semi-additive processes===
[[File:Double side PCB process flow chart.png|thumb|upright=1.5|The two processing methods used to produce a double-sided PWB with plated-through holes]]

Subtractive methods remove copper from an entirely copper-coated board to leave only the desired copper pattern.  In additive methods the pattern is [[Electroplating|electroplated]] onto a bare substrate using a complex process. The advantage of the additive method is that less material is needed and less waste is produced. In the full additive process the bare laminate is covered with a photosensitive film which is imaged (exposed to light through a mask and then developed which removes the unexposed film).  The exposed areas are sensitized in a chemical bath, usually containing palladium and similar to that used for through hole plating which makes the exposed area capable of bonding metal ions.  The laminate is then plated with copper in the sensitized areas.  When the mask is stripped, the PCB is finished.

Semi-additive is the most common process: The unpatterned board has a thin layer of copper already on it. A reverse mask is then applied. (Unlike a subtractive process mask, this mask exposes those parts of the substrate that will eventually become the traces.) Additional copper is then plated onto the board in the unmasked areas; copper may be plated to any desired weight. Tin-lead or other surface platings are then applied. The mask is stripped away and a brief etching step removes the now-exposed bare original copper laminate from the board, isolating the individual traces.  Some single-sided boards which have plated-through holes are made in this way.  [[General Electric]] made consumer radio sets in the late 1960s using additive boards.

The (semi-)additive process is commonly used for multi-layer boards as it facilitates the [[plating]]-through of the holes to produce conductive [[via (electronics)|vias]] in the circuit board.

===Chemical etching===
[[Industrial etching|Chemical etching]] is usually done with [[ammonium persulfate]] or [[ferric chloride]]. For PTH (plated-through holes), additional steps of [[Electroplating#Electroless deposition|electroless deposition]] are done after the holes are drilled, then copper is electroplated to build up the thickness, the boards are screened, and plated with tin/lead. The tin/lead becomes the resist leaving the bare copper to be etched away.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=mFjuCAAAQBAJ|title=The Electronics Assembly Handbook|last=Riley|first=Frank|last2=Production|first2=Electronic Packaging and|date=2013-06-29|publisher=Springer Science &amp; Business Media|year=|isbn=9783662131619|location=|pages=285|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The simplest method, used for small-scale production and often by hobbyists, is immersion etching, in which the board is submerged in etching solution such as ferric chloride. Compared with methods used for mass production, the etching time is long.  Heat and agitation can be applied to the bath to speed the etching rate. In bubble etching, air is passed through the etchant bath to agitate the solution and speed up etching. Splash etching uses a motor-driven paddle to splash boards with etchant; the process has become commercially obsolete since it is not as fast as spray etching. In spray etching, the etchant solution is distributed over the boards by nozzles, and recirculated by pumps. Adjustment of the nozzle pattern, flow rate, temperature, and etchant composition gives predictable control of etching rates and high production rates.&lt;ref name="Khandpur05"&gt;R. S. Khandpur,''[https://books.google.com.bd/books/about/Printed_Circuit_Boards.html?id=VY8iBAAAQBAJ&amp;redir_esc=y Printed circuit boards: design, fabrication, assembly and testing]'', Tata-McGraw Hill, 2005 {{ISBN|0-07-058814-7}}, pages 373–378&lt;/ref&gt;

As more copper is consumed from the boards, the etchant becomes saturated and less effective; different etchants have different capacities for copper, with some as high as 150 grams of copper per litre of solution. In commercial use, etchants can be regenerated to restore their activity, and the dissolved copper recovered and sold.  Small-scale etching requires attention to disposal of used etchant, which is corrosive and toxic due to its metal content.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6OwRb7N3j14C|title=Printed Circuit Boards: Design and Technology|last=Bosshart|first=|date=1983-01-01|publisher=Tata McGraw-Hill Education|year=|isbn=9780074515495|location=|pages=298|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The etchant removes copper on all surfaces exposed by the resist.  "Undercut" occurs when etchant attacks the thin edge of copper under the resist; this can reduce conductor widths and cause open-circuits. Careful control of etch time is required to prevent undercut.  Where metallic plating is used as a resist, it can "overhang" which can cause short-circuits between adjacent traces when closely spaced. Overhang can be removed by wire-brushing the board after etching.&lt;ref name=Khandpur05 /&gt;

==={{Anchor|multi-layer}}Lamination===
[[File:Bga und via IMGP4531 wp.jpg|thumb|Cut through a SDRAM-module, a multi-layer PCB. Note the [[Via (electronics)|via]], visible as a bright copper-colored band running between the top and bottom layers of the board.]]

Multi-layer printed circuit boards have trace layers inside the board. This is achieved by laminating a stack of materials in a press by applying pressure and heat for a period of time. This results in an inseparable one piece product. For example, a four-layer PCB can be fabricated by starting from a two-sided copper-clad laminate, etch the circuitry on both sides, then laminate to the top and bottom pre-preg and copper foil. It is then drilled, plated, and etched again to get traces on top and bottom layers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://learnemc.com/pcb-layout|title=PCB Layout|accessdate=2018-05-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The inner layers are given a complete machine inspection before lamination because afterwards mistakes cannot be corrected. The automatic optical inspection system compares an image of the board with the digital image generated from the original design data.

===Drilling===
[[File:Ni000 Hollow rivets for Plated Through Hole PCB repair and small-scale manufacturing.png|thumb|Eyelets (hollow)]]

Holes through a PCB are typically drilled with [[drill bit]]s made of solid coated [[tungsten carbide]]. Coated tungsten carbide is used because board materials are abrasive.  High-speed-steel bits would dull quickly, tearing the copper and ruining the board. Drilling is done by computer-controlled drilling machines, using a ''drill file'' or [[Excellon file]] that describes the location and size of each drilled hole.

Holes may be made conductive, by electroplating or inserting hollow metal eyelets, to connect board layers. Some conductive holes are intended for the insertion of through-hole-component leads. Others used to connect board layers, are called [[Via (electronics)|vias]].

When very small vias are required, drilling with mechanical bits is costly because of high rates of wear and breakage. In this case, the vias may be [[laser drilling|laser drilled]]—evaporated by [[laser]]s. Laser-drilled vias typically have an inferior surface finish inside the hole. These holes are called ''micro vias''.  It is also possible with ''controlled-depth'' drilling, laser drilling, or by pre-drilling the individual sheets of the PCB before lamination, to produce holes that connect only some of the copper layers, rather than passing through the entire board. These holes are called ''blind vias'' when they connect an internal copper layer to an outer layer, or ''buried vias'' when they connect two or more internal copper layers and no outer layers.

The hole walls for boards with two or more layers can be made conductive and then electroplated with copper to form ''plated-through holes''. These holes electrically connect the conducting layers of the PCB. For multi-layer boards, those with three layers or more, drilling typically produces a ''smear'' of the high temperature decomposition products of bonding agent in the laminate system. Before the holes can be plated through, this smear must be removed by a chemical ''de-smear'' process, or by ''plasma-etch''. The de-smear process ensures that a good connection is made to the copper layers when the hole is plated through. On high reliability boards a process called etch-back is performed chemically with a potassium permanganate based etchant or plasma. The etch-back removes resin and the glass fibers so that the copper layers extend into the hole and as the hole is plated become integral with the deposited copper.

===Plating and coating===
Proper plating or surface finish selection can be critical to process yield, the amount of rework, field failure rate, and reliability.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.dfrsolutions.com/hubfs/Resources/services/Selecting-a-PCB-Surface-Finish.pdf?t=1509023781105|title=Considerations for Selecting a PCB Surface Finish|last=|first=|date=8 October 2013|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

PCBs are plated with solder, tin, or gold over nickel and a resist for [[etching]] away the unneeded underlying copper.&lt;ref&gt;[http://books.nap.edu/openbook.php?record_id=11515&amp;page=77 Appendix F Sample Fabrication Sequence for a Standard Printed Circuit Board], Linkages: Manufacturing Trends in Electronics Interconnection Technology, National Academy of Sciences&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://epa.gov/dfe/pubs/pwb/tech_rep/p2_report/p2_sec3.htm Production Methods and Materials 3.1 General] Printed Wiring Board Project Report – Table of Contents, Design for the Environment (DfE), US EPA&lt;/ref&gt;

After PCBs are etched and then rinsed with water, the solder mask is applied, and then any exposed copper is coated with solder, nickel/gold, or some other anti-corrosion coating.&lt;ref&gt;George Milad and Don Gudeczauskas. "[http://www.uyemura.com/solder-joint-reliability-of-gold-surface-finishes-ENIG-ENEPIG-DIG.htm Solder Joint Reliability of Gold Surface Finishes (ENIG, ENEPIG and DIG) for PWB Assembled with Lead Free SAC Alloy]."
&lt;/ref&gt;

Matte solder is usually fused to provide a better bonding surface for bare copper. Treatments, such as [[benzimidazolethiol]], prevent surface oxidation of bare copper. The places to which components will be mounted are typically plated, because untreated bare copper oxidizes quickly, and therefore is not readily solderable. Traditionally, any exposed copper was coated with solder by [[hot air solder levelling]] (HASL). The HASL finish prevents oxidation from the underlying copper, thereby guaranteeing a solderable surface. This solder was a [[tin]]-[[lead]] alloy, however new solder compounds are now used to achieve compliance with the [[RoHS]] directive in the [[European Union|EU]], which restricts the use of lead. One of these lead-free compounds is SN100CL, made up of 99.3% tin, 0.7% copper, 0.05% nickel, and a nominal of 60&amp;nbsp;ppm germanium.{{Citation needed|date=October 2016}}

It is important to use solder compatible with both the PCB and the parts used. An example is [[ball grid array]] (BGA) using tin-lead solder balls for connections losing their balls on bare copper traces or using lead-free solder paste.

Other platings used are OSP (organic surface protectant), immersion silver ([[IAg]]), immersion tin, electroless nickel with immersion gold coating ([[ENIG]]), electroless nickel electroless palladium immersion gold ([[ENEPIG]]) and direct [[gold plating]] (over nickel).  [[Edge connector]]s, placed along one edge of some boards, are often nickel-plated then [[gold-plated]]. Another coating consideration is rapid diffusion of coating metal into tin solder. Tin forms intermetallics such as Cu&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;Sn&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt; and Ag&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;Cu that dissolve into the Tin liquidus or solidus(@50C), stripping surface coating or leaving voids.

''Electrochemical migration'' (ECM) is the growth of conductive metal filaments on or in a printed circuit board (PCB) under the influence of a DC voltage bias.&lt;ref&gt;[[IPC (electronics)|IPC]] Publication IPC-TR-476A, "Electrochemical Migration: Electrically Induced Failures in Printed Wiring Assemblies," Northbrook, IL, May 1997.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;S.Zhan, M. H. Azarian and M. Pecht, "[https://www.calce.umd.edu/articles/abstracts/2005/density.htm Reliability Issues of No-Clean Flux Technology with Lead-free Solder Alloy for High Density Printed Circuit Boards]", 38th International Symposium on Microelectronics, pp. 367–375, Philadelphia, PA, September 25–29, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; Silver, zinc, and aluminum are known to grow [[Whisker (metallurgy)|whiskers]] under the influence of an electric field. Silver also grows conducting surface paths in the presence of halide and other ions, making it a poor choice for electronics use. Tin will grow "whiskers" due to tension in the plated surface. Tin-lead or solder plating also grows whiskers, only reduced by reducing the percentage of tin. Reflow to melt solder or tin plate to relieve surface stress lowers whisker incidence. Another coating issue is [[tin pest]], the transformation of tin to a powdery  allotrope at low temperature.&lt;ref&gt;Clyde F. Coombs ''Printed Circuits Handbook'' McGraw–Hill Professional, 2007 {{ISBN|0-07-146734-3}}, pages 45–19&lt;/ref&gt;

===Solder resist application===
Areas that should not be soldered may be covered with [[solder mask|solder resist]] (solder mask). One of the most common solder resists used today is called "LPI" ([[liquid photoimageable solder mask]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.coates.de/ccp/connections/liquid.pdf|title=liquid photoimageable solder masks|publisher=Coates Circuit Products|accessdate=2 Sep 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&amp;nbsp; A photo-sensitive coating is applied to the surface of the PWB, then exposed to light through the solder mask image film, and finally developed where the unexposed areas are washed away.  Dry film solder mask is similar to the dry film used to image the PWB for plating or etching.  After being laminated to the PWB surface it is imaged and developed as LPI.  Once but no longer commonly used, because of its low accuracy and resolution, is to screen print epoxy ink. In addition to repelling solder, solder resist also provides protection from the environment to the copper that would otherwise be exposed.

===Legend printing===
A legend is often printed on one or both sides of the PCB. It contains the [[Reference designator|component designators]], switch settings, test points and other indications helpful in assembling, testing, servicing, and sometimes using the circuit board.

There are three methods to print the legend.
#[[screen-printing|Silk screen printing]] epoxy ink was the established method. It was so common that legend is often misnamed silk or silkscreen.
#Liquid photo imaging is a more accurate method than screen printing.
#Ink jet printing is new but increasingly used. Ink jet can print variable data, unique to each PWB unit, such as text or a [[bar code]] with a [[serial number]].

===Bare-board test===
Boards with no components installed are usually ''bare-board tested'' for "shorts" and "opens". A short is a connection between two points that should not be connected. An open is a missing connection between points that should be connected. For high-volume production, a fixture or a [[rigid needle adapter]] makes contact with copper lands on the board. The fixture or adapter is a significant fixed cost and this method is only economical for high-volume or high-value production. For small or medium volume production ''[[flying probe]]'' testers are used where test probes are moved over the board by an XY drive to make contact with the copper lands. There is no need for a fixture and hence the fixed costs are much lower. The CAM system ''instructs'' the electrical tester to apply a voltage to each contact point as required and to check that this voltage appears on the appropriate contact points and only on these.

===Assembly===
[[File:Testpad.JPG|thumb|PCB with test connection pads]]
In assembly the bare board is populated (or "stuffed") with electronic components to form a functional ''printed circuit assembly'' (PCA), sometimes called a "printed circuit board assembly" (PCBA).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Ayob | first1 = M. | last2 = Kendall | first2 = G. | year = 2008 | title = A Survey of Surface Mount Device Placement Machine Optidmisation: Machine Classification | url = | journal = European Journal of Operational Research | volume = 186 | issue = 3| pages = 893–914 | doi = 10.1016/j.ejor.2007.03.042 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Ayob | first1 = M. | last2 = Kendall | first2 = G. | year = 2005 | title = A Triple Objective Function with a Chebychev Dynamic Pick-and-place Point Specification Approach to Optimise the Surface Mount Placement Machine | url = http://www.cs.nott.ac.uk/~gxk/gxk1/../papers/mxaejor2005.pdf| journal = European Journal of Operational Research | volume = 164 | issue = 3| pages = 609–626 | doi = 10.1016/j.ejor.2003.09.034 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[through-hole technology]], the component leads are inserted in holes surrounded by conductive ''pads''; the holes keep the components in place. In [[surface-mount technology]] (SMT), the component is placed on the PCB so that the pins line up with the conductive ''pads'' or ''lands'' on the surfaces of the PCB; solder paste, which was previously applied to the pads, holds the components in place temporarily; if surface-mount components are applied to both sides of the board, the bottom-side components are glued to the board. In both through hole and surface mount, the components are then [[soldering|soldered]]; once cooled and solidified, the solder holds the components in place permanently and electrically connects them to the board.

There are a variety of [[soldering]] techniques used to attach components to a PCB. High volume production is usually done with a "Pick and place machine" or [[SMT placement equipment|SMT placement machine]] and bulk wave soldering or [[reflow oven]]s, but skilled technicians are able to hand-solder very tiny parts (for instance 0201 packages which are 0.02 in. by 0.01 in.)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.smta.org/files/smta_techscan_0201_overview.pdf |title=SMTA TechScan Compendium: 0201 Design, Assembly and Process |accessdate=2010-01-11 |last=Borkes |first=Tom |publisher=Surface Mount Technology Association}}&lt;/ref&gt; under a [[microscope]], using tweezers and a fine-tip [[soldering iron]], for small volume prototypes. Some SMT parts cannot be soldered by hand, such as [[ball grid array|BGA]] packages. All through-hole components can be hand soldered, making them favored for prototyping where size, weight, and the use of the exact components that would be used in high volume production are not concerns.

Often, through-hole and surface-mount construction must be combined in a single assembly because some required components are available only in surface-mount packages, while others are available only in through-hole packages. Or, even if all components are available in through-hole packages, it might be desired to take advantage of the size, weight, and cost reductions obtainable by using some available surface-mount devices. Another reason to use both methods is that through-hole mounting can provide needed strength for components likely to endure physical stress (such as connectors that are frequently mated and demated or that connect to cables expected to impart substantial stress to the PCB-and-connector interface), while components that are expected to go untouched will take up less space using surface-mount techniques. ''For further comparison, see the [[Surface-mount technology#Advantages|SMT page]].''

After the board has been populated it may be tested in a variety of ways:
* While the power is off, [[visual inspection]], [[automated optical inspection]]. [[JEDEC]] guidelines for PCB component placement, soldering, and inspection are commonly used to maintain [[quality control]] in this stage of PCB manufacturing.
* While the power is off, [[analog signature analysis]], [[power-off testing]].
* While the power is on, [[in-circuit test]], where physical measurements (for example, voltage) can be done.
* While the power is on, [[functional test]], just checking if the PCB does what it had been designed to do.
To facilitate these tests, PCBs may be designed with extra pads to make temporary connections. Sometimes these pads must be isolated with resistors. The in-circuit test may also exercise [[boundary scan]] test features of some components. In-circuit test systems may also be used to program nonvolatile memory components on the board.

In boundary scan testing, test circuits integrated into various ICs on the board form temporary connections between the PCB traces to test that the ICs are mounted correctly. Boundary scan testing requires that all the ICs to be tested use a standard test configuration procedure, the most common one being the Joint Test Action Group ([[JTAG]]) standard. The [[JTAG]] test architecture provides a means to test interconnects between integrated circuits on a board without using physical test probes, by using circuitry in the ICs to employ the IC pins themselves as test probes. [[JTAG]] tool vendors provide various types of stimuli and sophisticated algorithms, not only to detect the failing nets, but also to isolate the faults to specific nets, devices, and pins.

When boards fail the test, technicians may [[desoldering|desolder]] and replace failed components, a task known as ''[[Rework (electronics)|rework]]''.

===Protection and packaging===
PCBs intended for extreme environments often have a [[conformal coating]], which is applied by dipping or spraying after the components have been soldered. The coat prevents corrosion and leakage currents or shorting due to condensation. The earliest conformal coats were [[wax]]; modern conformal coats are usually dips of dilute solutions of silicone rubber, polyurethane, acrylic, or epoxy. Another technique for applying a conformal coating is for plastic to be [[sputter deposition|sputtered]] onto the PCB in a vacuum chamber. The chief disadvantage of conformal coatings is that servicing of the board is rendered extremely difficult.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| last = Shibu | first = | authorlink = | coauthors = | title = Intro To Embedded Systems 1E | publisher = Tata McGraw-Hill | date = | location = | page = 293 | url = | doi = | id = | isbn = 978-0-07-014589-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many assembled PCBs are [[Electrostatic discharge|static]] sensitive, and therefore they must be placed in [[antistatic bag]]s during transport. When handling these boards, the user must be [[Ground (electricity)|grounded (earthed)]]. Improper handling techniques might transmit an accumulated static charge through the board, damaging or destroying components. The damage might not immediately affect function but might lead to early failure later on, cause intermittent operating faults, or cause a narrowing of the range of environmental and electrical conditions under which the board functions properly. Even bare boards are sometimes static sensitive: traces have become so fine that it's quite possible to blow an etch off the board (or change its characteristics) with a static charge. This is especially true on non-traditional PCBs such as [[Multi-Chip Module|MCMs]] and microwave PCBs.

==Cordwood construction==
{{Refimprove section|date=December 2016}}
[[File:Cordwoodcircuit.agr.jpg|thumb|upright=1.5|A cordwood module]]
[[File:MK53 fuze.jpg|thumb|Cordwood construction was used in [[proximity fuze]]s.]]

Cordwood construction can save significant space and was often used with [[Through-hole technology|wire-ended components]] in applications where space was at a premium (such as [[fuze]]s, missile guidance, and telemetry systems) and in high-speed [[computer]]s, where short traces were important. In cordwood construction, axial-leaded components were mounted between two parallel planes. The components were either soldered together with jumper wire, or they were connected to other components by thin nickel ribbon welded at right angles onto the component leads.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Wagner |first=G. Donald |title=History of Electronic Packaging at APL: From the VT Fuze to the NEAR Spacecraft |journal=Johns Hopkins APL Technical Digest |volume=20 |issue=1 |date=1999 |url=http://www.jhuapl.edu/techdigest/TD/td2001/Wagner.pdf |accessdate=2016-12-19 |format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt; To avoid shorting together different interconnection layers, thin insulating cards were placed between them. Perforations or holes in the cards allowed component leads to project through to the next interconnection layer. One disadvantage of this system was that special [[nickel]]-leaded components had to be used to allow the interconnecting welds to be made. Differential thermal expansion of the component could put pressure on the leads of the components and the PCB traces and cause mechanical damage (as was seen in several modules on the Apollo program). Additionally, components located in the interior are difficult to replace. Some versions of cordwood construction used soldered single-sided PCBs as the interconnection method (as pictured), allowing the use of normal-leaded components.

Before the advent of [[integrated circuit]]s, this method allowed the highest possible component packing density; because of this, it was used by a number of computer vendors including [[Control Data Corporation]]. The cordwood method of construction was used only rarely once semiconductor electronics and PCBs became widespread.

==Multiwire boards==
Multiwire is a patented technique of interconnection which uses machine-routed insulated wires embedded in a non-conducting matrix (often plastic resin). It was used during the 1980s and 1990s. (Kollmorgen Technologies Corp, {{US Patent|4175816}} filed 1978) As of 2010, Multiwire was still available through Hitachi.

Since it was quite easy to stack interconnections (wires) inside the embedding matrix, the approach allowed designers to forget completely about the routing of wires (usually a time-consuming operation of PCB design): Anywhere the designer needs a connection, the machine will draw a wire in a straight line from one location/pin to another. This led to very short design times (no complex algorithms to use even for high density designs) as well as reduced [[crosstalk]] (which is worse when wires run parallel to each other&amp;mdash;which almost never happens in Multiwire), though the cost is too high to compete with cheaper PCB technologies when large quantities are needed.

Corrections can be made to a Multiwire board more easily than to a PCB.&lt;ref&gt;David E. Weisberg.
[http://www.cadhistory.net/14%20Intergraph.pdf "Chapter 14: Intergraph"].
2008.
p. 14-8.
&lt;/ref&gt;

There are other competitive discrete wiring technologies that have been developed.

The '''purine nucleotide cycle''' is a [[metabolic pathway]] in which [[fumarate]] is generated from [[aspartate]] in order to increase the concentration of [[Krebs cycle]] intermediates.&lt;ref&gt;Salway, J. G., Metabolism at a glance (3rd edition), Blackwell Publishing Ltd., Oxford, 2004, pp. 56-57&lt;/ref&gt; The pathway was first described by John Lowenstein, who demonstrated its role in increasing the rate of [[oxidative phosphorylation]] in [[skeletal muscle]].&lt;ref&gt;Voet, D., Voet, J. G., Biochemistry (3rd Edition), John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc., 2004, pp. 1094-1095&lt;/ref&gt;

==Outline==
The cycle is composed of three [[Enzyme|enzyme-catalysed]] reactions. The first stage is the deamination of the purine [[nucleotide]] [[Adenosine monophosphate]] (AMP) to form [[inosine monophosphate]] (IMP), catalysed by the enzyme [[AMP deaminase]]:

:AMP + H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O → IMP + NH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;

The second stage is the formation of [[adenylosuccinate]] from IMP and the amino acid [[aspartate]], which is coupled to the energetically favourable hydrolysis of [[Guanosine triphosphate|GTP]], and catalysed by the enzyme [[adenylosuccinate synthetase]]:

:Aspartate + IMP + GTP → Adenylosuccinate + [[Guanosine diphosphate|GDP]] + [[Inorganic phosphate|P&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;]]

Finally, Adenylosuccinate is cleaved by the enzyme [[adenylosuccinate lyase]] to release fumarate and regenerate the starting material of AMP:

:Adenylosuccinate → AMP + Fumarate

A recent study conducted by Sridharan et al. (AJP Cell Physiology, 2008, 295:C29-C37) showed that activation of HIF-1α allows cardiomyocytes to sustain mitochondrial membrane potential during anoxic stress by utilizing fumarate produced by adenylosuccinate lyase as an alternate terminal electron acceptor in place of oxygen.  This mechanism should help provide protection in the ischemic heart.

==Occurrence==
This cycle occurs in [[Skeletal muscle]] myocyte's cytosolic compartment. This reaction helps to dispose AMP produced after following reaction.
:ATP → ADP + Pi (Utilisation of ATP for [[Muscle contraction]])
2 ADP →  ATP + AMP (Catalysed by [[Adenylyl kinase]]/Myokinase)

Purine nucleotide cycle occurs during strenuous exercise, fasting or starvation when ATP reservoirs run low.

==Consequences==
1)  Synthesis of [[fumarate]]

Fumarate is an intermediate of TCA cycle and enters the mitochondria by converting into malate and utilising the [[malate shuttle]] where it is converted into Oxaloacetic acid (OAA). OAA either enters into [[TCA cycle]] or converts into aspartate in the mitochondria. Aspartate can re-enter purine nucleotide cycle.

Oxaloacetic acid + Glutamate ↔ α-Ketoglutarate + Aspartate
( Catalysed by Aspartate Aminotransferase)

2) Synthesis of ammonia (Ammonia genesis)

The [[glutamate]] produced by OAA as above gains an NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; to become a Glutamine and enters the circulation to reach kidneys. In kidneys, glutamine is deaminated twice to form glutamate and then α Ketoglutarate. These NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; molecules neutralise the organic acids ([[lactic acid]] and [[ketone bodies]]) produced in the muscles.

'''Realism''', sometimes called '''naturalism''', in [[the arts]] is generally the attempt to represent subject matter truthfully, without [[artificiality]] and avoiding artistic conventions, or implausible, exotic, and supernatural elements.  Realism has been prevalent in the arts at many periods, and can be in large part a matter of technique and training, and the avoidance of stylization.

In the visual arts, illusionistic realism is the accurate depiction of lifeforms, perspective, and the details of light and colour. But realist or naturalist works of art may, as well or instead of illusionist realism, be "realist" in their subject-matter, and emphasize the mundane, ugly or sordid.  This is typical of the 19th-century  [[Realism (art movement)|Realist movement]] that began in France in the 1850s, after the [[French Revolution of 1848|1848 Revolution]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.metmuseum.org/toah/hd/rlsm/hd_rlsm.htm |title=Metropolitan Museum of Art |publisher=Metmuseum.org |date=2014-06-02 |accessdate=2014-07-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; and also [[social realism]], [[Regionalism (art)|regionalism]], or [[kitchen sink realism]]. The Realist painters rejected [[Romanticism]], which had come to dominate French literature and art, with roots in the late [[18th century]].

There have been various movements invoking realism in the other arts, such as the [[opera]] style of [[Verismo (music)|verismo]], [[literary realism]], [[Realism (theatre)|theatrical realism]], and [[Italian neorealism|Italian neorealist cinema]].

Realism is the precise, detailed and accurate representation in art of the visual appearance of scenes and objects i.e., it is drawn in photographic precision. Realism in this sense is also called [[Naturalism (visual art)#Realism or naturalism as resisting idealization|naturalism]], [[mimesis]] or [[Illusionism (art)|illusionism]]. Realistic art was created in many periods, and it is in large part a matter of technique and training, and the avoidance of [[stylization]].  It becomes especially marked in European painting in the [[Early Netherlandish painting]] of [[Robert Campin]], [[Jan van Eyck]] and other artists in the 15th century.  However such "realism" is often used to depict, for example, angels with wings, which were not things the artists had ever seen in real life. Equally, 19th-century [[Realism art movement]] painters such as [[Gustave Courbet]] are by no means especially noted for precise and careful depiction of visual appearances; in Courbet's time that was more often a characteristic of [[academic painting]], which very often depicted with great skill and care scenes that were contrived and artificial, or imagined historical scenes.  It is the choice and treatment of subject matter that defines Realism as a movement in painting, rather than the careful attention to visual appearances.  Other terms such as naturalism, naturalistic and "veristic" do not escape the same ambiguity, though the distinction between "realistic" (usually related to visual appearance) and "realist" is often useful, as is the term "illusionistic" for the accurate rendering of visual appearances.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=aSBAUzb8SokC&amp;pg=PA7&amp;dq=Realism+painting&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=sfslUYLPDKK30QXLmIHIAQ&amp;ved=0CGQQ6AEwCQ#v=onepage&amp;q=Realism%20painting&amp;f=false Stremmel, Kerstin,  ''Realism''], pp. 6–9, 2004, Taschen, {{ISBN|3822829420|978-3822829424}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Finocchio, Ross.

===Illusionistic realism===
[[File:Frederic Leighton - Cimabue's Madonna Carried in Procession - Google Art Project 2.jpg|thumb|left|[[Lord Leighton]]'s ''[[Cimabue's Celebrated Madonna]]'' of 1853–55 is at the end of a long tradition of illusionism in painting, but is not Realist in the sense of Courbet's work of the same period.]]

The development of increasingly accurate representation of the visual appearances of things has a long history in art.  It includes elements such as the accurate depiction of the anatomy of humans and animals, of [[graphical perspective|perspective]] and effects of distance, and of detailed effects of light and colour. The [[Art of the Upper Paleolithic]] in Europe achieved remarkably lifelike depictions of animals, and [[Ancient Egyptian art]] developed conventions involving both [[stylization]] and idealization that nevertheless allowed very effective depictions to be produced very widely and consistently. [[Ancient Greek art]] is commonly recognised as having made great progress in the representation of anatomy, and has remained an influential model ever since. No original works on panels or walls by the great Greek painters survive, but from literary accounts, and the surviving corpus of derivative works (mostly Graeco-Roman works in [[mosaic]]) it is clear that illusionism was highly valued in painting. [[Pliny the Elder]]'s famous story of birds pecking at grapes painted by [[Zeuxis]] in the 5th century BC may well be a legend, but indicates the aspiration of Greek painting. As well as accuracy in shape, light and colour, Roman paintings show an unscientific but effective knowledge of representing distant objects smaller than closer ones, and representing regular geometric forms such as the roof and walls of a room with perspective.  This progress in illusionistic effects in no way meant a rejection of idealism; statues of Greek gods and heroes attempt to represent with accuracy idealized and beautiful forms, though other works, such as heads of the famously ugly [[Socrates]], were allowed to fall below these ideal standards of beauty. [[Roman portraiture]], when not under too much Greek influence, shows a greater commitment to a truthful depiction of its subjects.

The art of [[Late Antiquity]] famously rejected illusionism for expressive force, a change already well underway by the time Christianity began to affect the art of the elite. In the West classical standards of illusionism did not begin to be reached again until the [[Late medieval]] and [[Early Renaissance]] periods, and were helped, first in the Netherlands in the early 15th century, and around the 1470s in Italy, by the development of new techniques of [[oil painting]] which allowed very subtle and precise effects of light to be painted using very small brushes and several layers of paint and glaze.  Scientific methods of representing perspective were developed in Italy in the early 15th century and gradually spread across Europe, and accuracy in anatomy rediscovered under the influence of classical art. As in classical times, [[Idealism (art)|idealism]] remained the norm.

The accurate depiction of [[landscape painting|landscape in painting]] had also been developing in Early Netherlandish/Early Northern Renaissance and Italian Renaissance painting, and was then brought to a very high level in 17th-century [[Dutch Golden Age painting]], with very subtle techniques for depicting a range of weather conditions and degrees of natural light. After being another development of Early Netherlandish painting, by 1600 European portraiture could give a very good likeness in both painting and sculpture, though the subjects were often idealized by smoothing features or giving them an artificial pose. [[Still life]] paintings, and still life elements in other works, played a considerable role in developing illusionistic painting, though in the Netherlandish tradition of flower painting they long lacked "realism", in that flowers from all seasons were typically used, either from the habit of assembling compositions from individual drawings, or as a deliberate convention; the large displays of [[Flower bouquet|bouquets]] in vases, though close to modern displays of cut flowers that they have influenced, were entirely atypical of 17th-century habits, where flowers were displayed one at a time.  Intriguingly, having led the development of illusionic painting, still life was to be equally significant in its abandonment in [[Cubism]].

===Realism or naturalism as the depiction of ordinary, everyday subjects===
[[File:Simon Bening (Flemish - Gathering Twigs - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|left|Woodcutting, miniature from a set of [[Labours of the Months]] by [[Simon Bening]], c. 1550]]

The depiction of ordinary, everyday subjects in art also has a long history, though it was often squeezed into the edges of compositions, or shown at a smaller scale. This was partly because art was expensive, and usually commissioned for specific religious, political or personal reasons, that allowed only a relatively small amount of space or effort to be devoted to such scenes. [[Drolleries]] in the margins of medieval [[illuminated manuscripts]] sometimes contain small scenes of everyday life, and the development of perspective created large background areas in many scenes set outdoors that could be made more interesting by including small figures going about their everyday lives. Medieval and Early Renaissance art by convention usually showed non-sacred figures in contemporary dress, so no adjustment was needed for this even in religious or historical scenes set in ancient times.

Early Netherlandish painting brought the painting of portraits as low down the social scale as the prosperous merchants of [[Flanders]], and in some of these, notably the ''[[Arnolfini Portrait]]'' by Jan van Eyck (1434), and more often in religious scenes such as the [[Merode Altarpiece]], by [[Robert Campin]] and his workshop (circa 1427), include very detailed depictions of middle-class interiors full of lovingly depicted objects.  However these objects are at least largely there because they carry layers of complex significance and symbolism that undercut any commitment to realism for its own sake. Cycles of the [[Labours of the Months]] in late medieval art, of which many examples survive from [[books of hours]], concentrate on peasants labouring on different tasks through the seasons, often in a rich landscape background, and were significant both in developing [[landscape art]] and the depiction of everyday working-class people.
[[File:Annibale Carracci - Butcher's Shop - WGA04409.jpg|thumb|[[Annibale Carracci]], ''The Butcher's Shop'', early 1580s]]

In the 16th century there was a fashion for the depiction in large paintings of scenes of people working, especially in food markets and kitchens: in many the food is given as much prominence as the workers. Artists included [[Pieter Aertsen]] and his nephew [[Joachim Beuckelaer]] in the Netherlands, working in an essentially Mannerist style, and in Italy the young [[Annibale Carracci]] in the 1580s, using a very down to earth unpolished style, with [[Bartolomeo Passerotti]] somewhere between the two. [[Pieter Bruegel the Elder]] pioneered large panoramic scenes of peasant life.  Such scenes acted as a prelude for the popularity of scenes of work in [[genre painting]] in the 17th century, which appeared all over Europe, with [[Dutch Golden Age painting]] sprouting several [[Dutch Golden Age painting#Scenes of everyday life|different subgenres]] of such scenes, the [[Bamboccianti]] (though mostly from the [[Low Countries]]) in Italy, and in Spain the genre of [[bodegones]], and the introduction of unidealized peasants into [[history paintings]] by [[Jusepe de Ribera]] and [[Velázquez]].  The [[Le Nain brothers]] in France and many Flemish artists including [[Adriaen Brouwer]] and [[David Teniers the Elder]] and [[David Teniers the Younger|Younger]] painted peasants, but rarely townsfolk. In the 18th century small paintings of working people working remained popular, mostly drawing on the Dutch tradition, and especially featuring women.

Much art depicting ordinary people, especially in the form of [[Old master print|prints]], was comic and moralistic, but the mere poverty of the subjects seems relatively rarely have been part of the moral message.  From the mid-19th century onwards this changed, and the difficulties of life for the poor were emphasized. Despite this trend coinciding with large-scale migration from the countryside to cities in most of Europe, painters still tended to paint poor rural people, largely leaving illustrators such as [[Gustave Doré]] to show the horrors of city slums.  Crowded city street scenes were popular with the Impressionists and related painters, especially ones showing Paris.

Medieval manuscript illuminators were often asked to illustrate technology, but after the Renaissance such images continued in book illustration and prints, but with the exception of [[marine painting]] largely disappeared in [[fine art]] until the early [[Industrial Revolution]], scenes from which were painted by a few painters such as [[Joseph Wright of Derby]] and [[Philip James de Loutherbourg]]. Such subjects probably failed to sell very well, and there is a noticeable absence of industry, other than a few [[railway]] scenes, in painting until the later 19th century, when works began to be commissioned, typically by industrialists or for institutions in industrial cities, often on a large scale, and sometimes given a quasi-heroic treatment.

[[American realism]], a movement of the early 20th century, is one of many modern movements to use realism in this sense.

===Realist movement===
{{main|Realism (art movement)}}
The Realist movement began in the mid-19th century as a reaction to [[Romanticism]] and [[History painting]]. In favor of depictions of 'real' life, the Realist painters used common laborers, and ordinary people in ordinary surroundings engaged in real activities as subjects for their works. Its chief exponents were [[Gustave Courbet]], [[Jean-François Millet]], [[Honoré Daumier]], and [[Jean-Baptiste-Camille Corot]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nga.gov/collection/sfp/noflash/realism/1941_6_1.htm |title=NGA Realism movement |publisher=Nga.gov |date=1941-01-06 |accessdate=2014-07-15 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140714144138/http://www.nga.gov/collection/sfp/noflash/realism/1941_6_1.htm |archivedate=2014-07-14 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nationalgallery.org.uk/paintings/glossary/realist-movement |title=National Gallery glossary, Realism movement |publisher=Nationalgallery.org.uk |date= |accessdate=2014-07-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://impressionist1877.tripod.com/realism.htm |title=Philosophy of Realism |publisher=Impressionist1877.tripod.com |date= |accessdate=2014-07-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Ross Finocchio, formerly of the Department of European Paintings at the [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]], Realists used unprettified detail depicting the existence of ordinary contemporary life, coinciding in the contemporaneous naturalist literature of [[Émile Zola]], [[Honoré de Balzac]], and [[Gustave Flaubert]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.metmuseum.org/toah/hd/rlsm/hd_rlsm.htm |title=Nineteenth-Century French Realism &amp;#124; Thematic Essay &amp;#124; Heilbrunn Timeline of Art History &amp;#124; The Metropolitan Museum of Art |publisher=Metmuseum.org |date=2014-06-02 |accessdate=2014-07-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The French Realist movement had equivalents in all other Western countries, developing somewhat later. In particular the [[Peredvizhniki]] or ''Wanderers'' group in Russia who formed in the 1860s and organized exhibitions from 1871 included many realists such as [[Ilya Repin]], [[Vasily Perov]], and [[Ivan Shishkin]], and had a great influence on Russian art. In Britain artists such as [[Hubert von Herkomer]] and [[Luke Fildes]] had great success with realist paintings dealing with social issues.

===Realism or naturalism as resisting idealization===
[[File:La familia de Carlos IV.jpg|thumb|[[Francisco Goya]], ''[[Charles IV of Spain and His Family]]'', 1800–01]]

Realism or naturalism as a style meaning the honest, unidealizing depiction of the subject, can be used in depicting any type of subject, without any commitment to treating the typical or everyday.  Despite the general idealism of classical art, this too had classical precedents, which came in useful when defending such treatments in the Renaissance and [[Baroque]]. [[Demetrius of Alopece]] was a 4th-century BCE sculptor whose work (all now lost) was said to prefer realism over ideal beauty, and during the [[Ancient Roman Republic]] even politicians preferred a truthful depiction in portraits, though the early emperors favoured Greek idealism. [[Goya]]'s portraits of the Spanish royal family represent a sort of peak in the honest and downright unflattering portrayal of important persons.

[[File:Eilif Peterssen-Laksefiskeren (1889).jpg|thumb|left|[[Eilif Peterssen]], ''The Salmon Fisher'', 1889.]]
A recurring trend in [[Christian art]] was "realism" that emphasized the humanity of religious figures, above all [[Christ]] and his physical sufferings in his [[Passion of Jesus|Passion]].  Following trends in [[devotional literature]], this developed in the [[Late Middle Ages]], where some painted wooden sculptures in particular strayed into the grotesque in portraying Christ covered in wounds and blood, with the intention of stimulating the viewer to meditate on the suffering that Christ had undergone on his behalf.  These were especially found in Germany and [[Central Europe]].  After abating in the Renaissance, similar works re-appeared in the [[Baroque]], especially in Spanish sculpture.

Renaissance theorists opened a debate, which was to last several centuries, as to the correct balance between drawing art from the observation of nature and from idealized forms, typically those found in classical models, or the work of other artists generally. All admitted the importance of the natural, but many believed it should be idealized to various degrees to include only the beautiful. [[Leonardo da Vinci]] was one who championed the pure study of nature, and wished to depict the whole range of individual varieties of forms in the human figure and other things.&lt;ref&gt;Blunt, 30–32, and the whole short chapter on Leonardo&lt;/ref&gt; [[Leon Battista Alberti]] was an early idealizer, stressing the typical,&lt;ref&gt;Blunt, 14–20&lt;/ref&gt; with others such as [[Michelangelo]] supporting selection of the most beautiful – he refused to make portraits for that reason.&lt;ref&gt;Blunt, 59–64&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Henri BIVA, ca 1905-06, Matin à Villeneuve, Salon 1906 postcard - original painting, oil on canvas, 151.1 x 125.1 cm, private collection.jpeg|thumb|upright|[[Henri Biva]], c. 1905–06, ''[[Matin à Villeneuve|Matin à Villeneuve (From Waters Edge)]]'', oil on canvas, 151.1 x 125.1 cm.]]
In the 17th century the debate continued, in Italy usually centred on the contrast between the relative "classical-idealism" of [[the Carracci]] and the "naturalist" style of the [[Caravaggisti]], or followers of [[Caravaggio]], who painted religious scenes as though set in the back streets of contemporary Italian cities, and used "naturalist" as a self-description. [[Bellori]], writing some decades after Caravaggio's early death, and no supporter of his style, refers to "Those who glory in the name of naturalists" (''naturalisti'').&lt;ref&gt;"Quelle che si gloriamo del nome de naturalisti", quoted in Raben, 134, note 31&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 19th century "Naturalism" or the "'''Naturalist school'''" was somewhat artificially erected as a term representing a breakaway sub-movement of Realism, that attempted (not wholly successfully) to distinguish itself from its parent by its avoidance of politics and social issues, and liked to proclaim a quasi-scientific basis, playing on the sense of "naturalist" as a student of [[Natural history]], as the [[biological sciences]] were then generally known.  The originator of the term was the French art critic [[Jules-Antoine Castagnary]], who in 1863 announced that: "The naturalist school declares that art is the expression of life under all phases and on all levels, and that its sole aim is to reproduce nature by carrying it to its maximum power and intensity: it is truth balanced with science".&lt;ref name="Needham"&gt;Needham&lt;/ref&gt; [[Émile Zola]] adopted the term with a similar scientific emphasis for his aims in the novel. Much Naturalist painting covered a similar range of subject matter as that of [[Impressionism]], but using tighter, more traditional brushwork styles, and in landscapes often with more gloomy weather.&lt;ref name="Needham"/&gt;

The term "continued to be used indiscriminately for various kinds of realism" for several decades, often as a catch-all term for art that was outside Impressionism and later movements of [[Modernism]] and also was not [[Academic art]].  The later periods of the French [[Barbizon School]] and the [[Düsseldorf school of painting]], with its students from many countries, and in 20th-century American [[Regionalism (art)|Regionalism]] are movements which are often also described as "Naturalist", although the term is rarely used of British painting.  Some recent art historians have deepened the confusion by claiming either Courbet or the Impressionists for the label.&lt;ref name="Needham"/&gt;

[https://books.google.com/books?id=MFAW6dh24ZwC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=realism&amp;ei=ROOkS_LBA5TszASD95nXCA&amp;cd=2#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false p. 5]&lt;/ref&gt; As such, the approach inherently implies a belief that such [[reality]] is [[ontological]]ly independent of human kind's conceptual schemes, linguistic practices and beliefs, and thus can be known (or knowable) to the artist, who can in turn represent this 'reality' faithfully. As [[Ian Watt]] states, modern realism "begins from the position that truth can be discovered by the individual through the senses" and as such "it has its origins in [[Descartes]] and [[John Locke|Locke]], and received its first full formulation by [[Thomas Reid]] in the middle of the eighteenth century."&lt;ref&gt;[[#refWatt1957|Watt, 1957]], p. 12&lt;/ref&gt;

While the preceding [[Romantic era]] was also a reaction against the values of the [[Industrial Revolution]], realism was in its turn a reaction to romanticism, and for this reason it is also commonly derogatorily referred as "traditional" "bourgeois realism".&lt;ref name="Barth79Replenishment"/&gt; Some writers of [[Victorian literature]] produced works of realism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Victorian Literature|url=http://www.online-literature.com/periods/victorian.php|publisher=The Literature Network|accessdate=7 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The rigidities, conventions, and other limitations of "bourgeois realism," prompted in their turn the revolt later labeled as [[Modernist literature|modernism]]; starting around 1900, the driving motive of modernist literature was the criticism of the 19th-century bourgeois social order and world view, which was countered with an antirationalist, antirealist and antibourgeois program.&lt;ref name="Barth79Replenishment"&gt;[[John Barth]] (1979) ''[[The Literature of Replenishment]]'', later republished in ''[[The Friday Book]]' '(1984).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Graff75"&gt;[[Gerald Graff]] (1975) ''Babbitt at the Abyss: The Social Context of Postmodern.

The achievement of realism in the [[theatre]] was to direct attention to the social and psychological problems of ordinary life. In its dramas, people emerge as victims of forces larger than themselves, as individuals confronted with a rapidly accelerating world.&lt;ref&gt;Simard, Rodney. ''Postmodern Drama: Contemporary Playwrights in America and Britain.''  New York: UP of America, 1984.&lt;/ref&gt; These pioneering playwrights were unafraid to present their characters as ordinary, impotent, and unable to arrive at answers to their predicaments. This type of art represents what we see with our human eyes. [[Anton Chekhov|Anton Chekov]], for instance, used camera works to reproduce an uninflected [[slice of life]], exposing the rhetorical and suasive character of realistic theatricality.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Modern Drama and the Rhetoric of Theater|last=Worthen|first=W.B.|publisher=University of California Press|year=1992|isbn=978-0520286870|location=Berkeley, CA|page=194}}&lt;/ref&gt; Scholars such as Thomas Postlewait noted that throughout the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, there were numerous joinings of [[melodrama]]tic and realistic forms and functions, which could be demonstrated in the way melodramatic elements existed in realistic forms and vice versa.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=American Theatre|last=Saxon|first=Theresa|publisher=Edinburgh University Press|year=2011|isbn=978-0748645206|location=Edinburgh|page=146}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the United States, realism in drama preceded fictional realism by about two decades as theater historians identified the first impetus toward realism during the late 1870s and early 1880s.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite book|title=American Realism and American Drama, 1880–1940|last=Murphy|first=Brenda|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=1987|isbn=978-0521327114|location=Cambridge|page=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its development is also attributed to [[William Dean Howells]] and [[Henry James]] who served as the spokesmen for realism as well as articulator of its aesthetic principles.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

The realistic approach to theater collapsed into [[nihilism]] and the [[Absurdism|absurd]] after World War II.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; 

==Cinema==
{{See also|Neorealism (art)|Poetic realism|Socialist realism}}

[[Italian Neorealism]] was a cinematic movement incorporating elements of realism that developed in post-WWII Italy. Notable Neorealists included [[Vittorio De Sica]], [[Luchino Visconti]], and [[Roberto Rossellini]]. Realist films generally focus on social issues.&lt;ref&gt;Hayward, Susan. "Realism" in ''Cinema Studies: The Key Concepts'' (Third Edition). Routledge, 2006. pp. 334–35&lt;/ref&gt; There are two types of realism in film: seamless realism and aesthetic realism. Seamless realism tries to use narrative structures and film techniques to create a "reality effect" to maintain its [[authenticity (philosophy)|authenticity]].&lt;ref&gt;Hayward, Susan. "Realism" in ''Cinema Studies: The Key Concepts'' (Third Edition). Routledge, 2006. pp. 334–35&lt;/ref&gt; Aesthetic realism, which was first called for by French filmmakers in the 1930s and promoted by [[Andre Bazin]] in the 1950s, acknowledges that a "film cannot be fixed to mean what it shows", as there are multiple realisms; as such, these filmmakers use location shooting, natural light and non-professional actors to ensure the viewer can make up her/his own choice based on the film, rather than being manipulated into a "preferred reading".&lt;ref&gt;Hayward, Susan. "Realism" in ''Cinema Studies: The Key Concepts'' (Third Edition). Routledge, 2006. pp. 334–35&lt;/ref&gt; [[Siegfried Kracauer]] is also notable for arguing that realism is the most important function of cinema.&lt;ref&gt;[[Dudley Andrew]], ''The Major Film Theories: An Introduction'', Oxford, New York: Oxford University Press, 1976, Part II.&lt;/ref&gt;

Aesthetic realist filmmakers use [[long shot]]s, [[deep focus]] and eye-level 90 degree shots to reduce manipulation of what the viewer sees.&lt;ref&gt;Hayward, Susan. "Realism" in ''Cinema Studies: The Key Concepts'' (Third Edition). Routledge, 2006. pp. 334–35&lt;/ref&gt; Italian neorealism filmmakers from after WWII took the existing realist film approaches from France and Italy that emerged in the 1960s and used the to create a politically-oriented cinema. French filmmakers made some politically-oriented realist films in the 1960s, such as the [[cinéma vérité]] and documentary films of [[Jean Rouch]].&lt;ref&gt;Hayward, Susan. "Realism" in ''Cinema Studies: The Key Concepts'' (Third Edition). Routledge, 2006. pp. 334–35&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1950s and 1960s, British, French and German new waves of filmmaking produced "slice-of-life" films (e.g., [[kitchen sink drama]]s in the UK).&lt;ref&gt;Hayward, Susan. "Realism" in ''Cinema Studies: The Key Concepts'' (Third Edition). Routledge, 2006. pp. 334–35&lt;/ref&gt;

==Opera==
{{main|Verismo}}
Verismo was a post-Romantic operatic tradition associated with Italian composers such as [[Pietro Mascagni]], [[Ruggero Leoncavallo]], [[Umberto Giordano]], [[Francesco Cilea]] and [[Giacomo Puccini]]. They sought to bring the naturalism of influential late 19th-century writers such as [[Émile Zola]], [[Gustave Flaubert]], and [[Henrik Ibsen]] into opera. This new style presented true-to-life drama that featured gritty and flawed lower-class protagonists&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=A Chronology Of Western Classical Music 1600-2000|last=Paxman|first=Jon|publisher=Omnibus Press|year=2014|isbn=978-1783231218|location=London|pages=425–26}}&lt;/ref&gt; while some described it as a heightened portrayal of a realistic event.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|title=A Tanner's Worth of Tune: Rediscovering the Post-war British Musical|last=Wright|first=Adrian|publisher=The Boydell Press|year=2010|isbn=978-1843835424|location=Suffolk, UK|page=139}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although an account considered [[Giuseppe Verdi]]'s ''[[Luisa Miller]]'' and ''[[La traviata|La Traviata]]'' as the first stirrings of the verismo,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Tosca|last=Carner|first=Mosco|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=1993|isbn=978-0521228244|location=Cambridge|page=6}}&lt;/ref&gt; some claimed that it began in 1890 with the first performance of [[Pietro Mascagni|Mascagni]]'s ''[[Cavalleria rusticana]]'', peaked in the early 1900s.&lt;ref&gt;"Verismo" in Stanley Sadie (ed.) ''The New Grove Dictionary of Music &amp; Musicians'', London: Macmillan/New York: Grove, 1980, vol. 19 p. 670, {{ISBN|1561591742}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was followed by Leoncavallo's Pagliacci, which dealt with the themes of infidelity, revenge, and violence.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Verismo also reached Britain where pioneers included the [[Victorian era|Victorian-era]] theatrical partnership of the [[dramatist]] [[W. S. Gilbert]] and the composer [[Arthur Sullivan]] (1842–1900).&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Specifically, their play ''[[Iolanthe]]'' is considered a realistic representation of the nobility although it included fantastical elements.

'''SHIFTCOR''' (Shift Correction) is a freely available web server as well as a stand-alone computer program for [[Protein Chemical Shift Re-Referencing|protein chemical shift re-referencing]].&lt;ref name=pmid12652131 /&gt;  [[Chemical shift]] referencing is a particularly widespread problem in biomolecular [[NMR]] with up to 25% of existing [[NMR]] [[chemical shift]] assignments being improperly referenced.&lt;ref name=pmid12652131 /&gt;  Some of these referencing problems can lead to systematic errors of between 1.0 to 2.5 ppm (especially in 13C and 15N chemical shifts).  Errors of this magnitude can play havoc with any attempt to compare assignments between proteins or to structurally interpret [[chemical shift]]s. Identifying which proteins are mis-assigned or improperly referenced can be challenging, as can correcting the errors once they are found. The SHIFTCOR program was designed to assist with identifying and fixing these [[chemical shift]] referencing problems.  Specifically it compares, identifies, corrects and re-references 1H, 13C and 15N backbone [[chemical shift]]s of peptides and proteins by comparing the observed [[chemical shift]]s with the predicted [[chemical shift]]s derived from the 3D structure (using [[Protein Data Bank|PDB]] coordinates) of the protein(s) of interest &lt;ref name=pmid12652131 /&gt;[1].

'''Salt marsh die-off''' is a term that has been used in the US and UK to describe the death of [[salt marsh]] [[cordgrass]] leading to subsequent degradation of habitat, specifically in the [[low marsh]] zones of salt marshes on the coasts of the Western Atlantic. Cordgrass normally anchors sediment in salt marshes; its loss leads to decreased substrate hardness, increased erosion, and collapse of creek banks into the water, ultimately resulting in decreased marsh health and productivity.

Die-off can affect several [[species]] of [[cordgrass]] (genus ''[[Spartina]]''), including ''[[Spartina alterniflora|S. alterniflora]]'', ''[[Spartina densiflora|S. densiflora]]'', and ''S. townsendii''. There are several competing hypotheses predicting the causes and mechanisms of salt marsh die-off throughout the western Atlantic. These hypotheses place different emphasis on the effects of top-down or bottom-up processes for salt marsh die-off. Combined with [[salt marsh dieback]] of the [[high marsh]], salt marsh die-off is a serious threat to the [[ecosystem services]] that marshes provide to local coastal communities.

==History of top-down vs. bottom-up==

In light of their effect on community processes, behaviors, and ecological interactions, [[Consumption (ecology)|consumptive interactions]] are some of the most widely studied concepts in [[ecology]]. Because of this, scientists use food webs to depict all of the food chains and trophic relationships in an ecological [[Community (ecology)|community]].
 
[[File:Food web diagram.svg|thumb|Example of a food web]] [[Food web]]s can be controlled by bottom-up or top-down forces, which dictate whether a food web’s structure and population dynamics are regulated by [[nutrient]]s (a supply of fixed [[carbon]]) and [[primary production]] or by [[Apex predators|top predators]], respectively. 
 
Much energy is lost from one [[trophic level]] to the next (about 90%); therefore, the success of higher levels is linked to lower ones and their supply of resources (Lindeman 1942).&lt;ref&gt;Lindeman, R.L. 1942. The trophic dynamic aspect of ecology. Ecology 23: 399-418.&lt;/ref&gt; However, the abundance and distribution of organisms in an [[ecosystem]] is also affected by densities of consumers, which limit the success of organisms at lower trophic levels and thereby influence the abundance of these organisms (Hairston et al. 1960).&lt;ref name=hairstonetal1960&gt;Hairston, N.G., E.D. Frederick, and B.S. Lawrence. 1960. Community structure, population control, and competition. The American Naturalist, 94(879): 421-425.&lt;/ref&gt;

Many ecologists argue that bottom-up and top-down control do not play equally critical roles in the structure and dynamics of populations in an ecosystem; however, data suggests that both bottom-up and top-down forces impact the structure of food webs and the spatial and temporal [[Abundance (ecology)|abundance]] and [[Distribution (ecology)|distribution]] of [[organism]]s (Bertness 2007),&lt;ref name=bertness2007&gt;Bertness, M.D. 2007. Atlantic Shorelines: Natural History and Ecology. Princeton, Jew Jersey: Princeton University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; although to what extent each plays a role is not fully understood.

Historically, an emphasis on bottom-up control in many ecosystems has prevailed in ecological thought, often to the exclusion of consumer control (Strong 1992).&lt;ref name=strong1992&gt;Strong D.R. 1992. Are trophic cascades all wet-differentiation and donor control in speciose ecosystems. Ecology 73(3): 747-754.&lt;/ref&gt; Many ecosystems in which consumer control has classically been considered trivial are dominated by plants (e.g., forests, grasslands, and salt marshes) and are usually green in appearance. Hairston and colleagues proposed an opposing view in 1960 that emphasized consumer control. They argued that the “world is green” because higher trophic levels regulate [[herbivore]] abundance (Hairston et al. 1960).&lt;ref name=hairstonetal1960/&gt;
 
Critics pointed out that the world is not always green, and that when it is, herbivores do not necessarily play an important role in structuring plant communities (Ehrlich and Birch 1967).&lt;ref&gt;Ehrlich, P.R. and L.C. Birch. 1967. The “balance of nature” and “population control.” The American Naturalist, 101: 97-107.&lt;/ref&gt; Others argued that what is green is not always edible or of sufficiently high quality to allow increases in herbivore populations (Dixon 1966, Murdoch 1966).&lt;ref&gt;Dixon, A.F.F. 1966. The effect of population density and nutritive status of the host on the summer reproductive activity of the sycamore aphid, Drepanosiphum platanoides. J. Anim. Ecol. 35 105-112.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Murdoch, W.W. 1966. Community structure, population control, and competition: a critique. The American Naturalist, 100: 219-226.&lt;/ref&gt; The debate is ongoing, but the dominant view of ecologists remains that although consumers affect many aspects of plant productivity and ecology, top-down control does not drive the productivity of entire plant ecosystems.
 
More recently, however, examples of conspicuous consumer control of entire ecosystems have emerged in a variety of [[habitat]]s including [[lake]]s (Carpenter et al. 1985),&lt;ref&gt;Carpenter, S. R., J. F. Kitchell, and J. R. Hodgson. Cascading trophic interactions and lake productivity. BioScience 35, 634-639 (1985).&lt;/ref&gt; [[river]]s (Power 1992),&lt;ref&gt;Power, M.E. 1992. Habitat heterogeneity and the functional significance of fish in river food webs. Ecology, 73: 1675-1688.&lt;/ref&gt; and marine (Estes and Duggins 1995)&lt;ref name=EstesandDuggins1995&gt;Estes, J. A. and D.O. Duggins. 1995. Sea otters and kelp forests in Alaska: Generality and variation in a community ecological paradigm. Ecological Monographs 65, 75-100.&lt;/ref&gt; habitats. [[Foundation species|Foundation]] plant species can be replaced with other species or [[Substrate (biology)|substratum]] completely lacking [[vegetation]] and [[insect]]s can defoliate whole [[mangrove]]s (Feller 2002).&lt;ref&gt;Feller, I. C. 2002. The role of herbivory by wood-boring insects in mangrove ecosystems in Belize. Oikos 97, 167-176.&lt;/ref&gt;
 
A classic example of top-down interactions dictating community structure and function comes from [[Robert Paine (zoologist)|Bob Paine’s]] work in Washington, which established that removal of the [[starfish]] ''[[Pisaster]]'' triggered a trophic cascade in which the blue mussel (''[[Mytilus (bivalve)|Mytilus]]'') populations exploded due to release from [[predation]] pressure (Paine 1966)&lt;ref&gt;Paine, R.T. 1966. Web complexity and species diversity. The American Naturalist, 100(910): 65-75.&lt;/ref&gt;
 
Another influential example of top-down control emerged from Jane Lubchenco’s experiments on New England [[rocky shore]]s, which demonstrated that the herbivorous [[snail]] ''[[Littorina littorea|L. littorea]]'' exerts control on the [[Biodiversity|diversity]] and [[Succession (ecology)|succession]] of [[tide pool]] [[Algae|algal]] communities (Lubchenco and Menge 1978).&lt;ref&gt;Lubchenco, J. and B.A. Menge. 1978. Community development and persistence in a low rocky intertidal zone. Ecological Monographs 48: 67-94.&lt;/ref&gt; One [[hypothesis]] that arose from Lubchenco’s work (Little and Kitching 1996)&lt;ref&gt;Little, C. and J.A. Kitching. 1996. The Biology of Rocky Shores. Oxford, UK: Oxford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; was that predation by the [[green crab]] (''[[Carcinus maenas]]'') influences rocky shore algal communities by regulating ''L. littorea'' abundances.
 
Ecologists cite these examples as [[evidence]] that consumer regulation is more potent and predominant than previously recognized.

==Historical paradigms of salt marsh theory==

[[File:Healthy salt marsh.jpg|thumb|border|right|Healthy salt marsh]]
In salt marshes, early ecologists like [[Eugene Odum]] and John Teal sparked the current bottom-up [[paradigm]] in ecology through work on Sapelo Island, GA (U.S.A) that stressed the dominant role of physical factors like [[temperature]], [[salinity]], and [[nutrients]] in regulating plant primary productivity and ecosystem structure (Teal 1962, Odum 1971).&lt;ref name=teal1962&gt;Teal, J.M. 1962. Energy flow in the salt marsh ecosystem of Georgia. Ecology 43: 614–624.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Odum, E.P. 1971. Fundamentals of Ecology. Philadelphia: Saunders.&lt;/ref&gt; Ecologists noted that marsh plants were not heavily grazed and appeared to be relatively unpalatable, and thus argued that most plants entered salt marsh food chains as [[detritus]] (Teal 1962).&lt;ref name=teal1962/&gt; A corollary of this dogma is that consumers play an unimportant or subtle role in controlling salt marsh primary production (Smalley 1960, Teal 1962).&lt;ref name=teal1962/&gt;&lt;ref name=smalley1960&gt;Smalley A.E. 1960.

Strong top-down control on marshes has been demonstrated in various marsh systems. Consumer control is driven by the [[Grapsidae|grapsid crab]] ([[Chasmagnathus granulata]]) in the salt marshes of Argentina and Brazil on the Atlantic coast of South America (Bortolus and Iribarne 1999).&lt;ref name=bortolusandiribarne1999/&gt; Other experiments in Argentina have contributed to the growing body of work evidencing consumer control in salt marshes (Alberti et al. 2007),&lt;ref name=albertietal2007&gt;Alberti J, M. Escapa, P. Daleo, O. Iribarne, B.R. Silliman, M.D. Bertness. 2007. Local and geographic variation in grazing intensity by herbivorous crabs in SW Atlantic salt marshes. Mar. Ecol. Prog. Ser. 349: 235–43.&lt;/ref&gt; and herbivory has also been suggested to play an important role in southwestern Atlantic marshes (Bortolus and Iribarne 1999, Alberti et al. 2007).&lt;ref name=bortolusandiribarne1999/&gt;&lt;ref name=albertietal2007/&gt; Not only are consumers important on a small scale as demonstrated by cage experiments in various locations (Silliman and Zieman 2001, Silliman and Bertness 2002, Silliman et al. 2005),&lt;ref name=sillimanandbertness2002/&gt;&lt;ref name=sillimanandzieman2001&gt;Silliman B.R., Zieman JC. 2001.

Science 310:1803–6.&lt;/ref&gt; but they also affect primary productivity across large geographic areas (Silliman and Zieman 2001).&lt;ref name=sillimanandzieman2001/&gt;

Bertness and Silliman have also suggested that while salt marshes may have historically been nutrient limited and bottom up controlled, human disturbances such as eutrophication and predator depletion has shifted these systems to top down control in recent decades (Bertness and Silliman 2008).&lt;ref name=bertnessandsilliman2008/&gt;

==Regional causes of salt marsh die-off==

[[File:Calving marsh creek bank.jpg|thumb|right|Calving creek bank of a marsh experiencing die-off in Cape Cod, Massachusetts]] Both top-down and bottom-up forces have been proposed as primary drivers of salt marsh die-off throughout the western Atlantic. The relative importance of these factors depends on the abiotic and biotic conditions of each local or regional marsh system and its environment.
 
===Top-down interactions===

Human activities can trigger trophic cascades (Jefferies 1997),&lt;ref name=jefferies1997/&gt; which occur when the predators that limit abundance of [[prey]] and thereby enhance survival of the next lower [[trophic level]] are depleted (Strong 1992).&lt;ref name=strong1992/&gt; Depletion of [[top predators]] releases their prey from consumer control and leads to population declines of the next lower trophic level, often the [[primary producers]]. [[Trophic cascade]]s occur across a minimum of three trophic levels and can impact [[Community (ecology)|community]] dynamics in a variety of systems (Estes et al. 1998).&lt;ref name=estesetal1998&gt;Estes, J.A., M.T. Tinker, T.M. Williams, and D.F. Doak. 1998. Killer whale predation on sea otters linking oceanic and nearshore ecosystems. Science 282: 473–476.&lt;/ref&gt; Trophic cascades can induce salt marsh die-off and transform green landscapes into [[Urchin barren|barrens]] (Estes and Duggins 1995, Silliman et al. 2005).&lt;ref name=EstesandDuggins1995/&gt;&lt;ref name=sillimanetal2005/&gt; Primary triggers of trophic cascades through human action include introduction of [[invasive species]], [[overexploitation]], and [[climate change]] (Jackson et al. 2001, Lotze et al. 2006, Gedan et al. 2009, Gedan and Bertness 2011).&lt;ref name=jacksonetal2001&gt;Jackson, J.B.C., et al. 2001. Historical overfishing and the recent collapse of coastal ecosystems. Science 293: 629–638.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=lotzeetal2006&gt;Lotze, H.K., Lenihan H.S., Bourque B.J., Bradbury R.H. and others. 2006. Depletion, degradation, and recovery potential of estuaries and coastal seas. Science 312: 1806-1809.&lt;/ref&gt;
 
====Invasive Species====

[[File:Myocastor Coypus Nutria Biberratte.jpg|thumb|right|The invasive rodent, nutria, ''[[Coypu|Myocastor coypus]]'']] Human introduction of non-native species can also contribute to top-down control of marsh systems (Furbish and Albano 1994, Gough and Grace 1998).&lt;ref name=furbishandalbano1994/&gt;&lt;ref name=goughandgrace1998&gt;Gough L. and J.B. Grace. 1998. Effects of flooding, salinity and herbivory on coastal plant communities, Louisiana, United States. Oecologia 117:527–35.&lt;/ref&gt; Introduced feral horses on the barrier islands of Maryland, Virginia, and the Carolinas have entirely denuded marsh ecosystems (Furbish and Albano 1994),&lt;ref name=furbishandalbano1994/&gt; and the introduced rodent [[Coypu|nutria]] on Gulf Coast marshes of Louisiana can decrease marsh plant primary production (Gough and Grace 1998).&lt;ref name=goughandgrace1998/&gt;

The invasive green crab, ''[[Carcinus maenas]]'', can turn off top down control by facilitating the recovery of salt marsh ecosystems. In marshes that have experienced die-off via the trophic cascade initiated by recreational overfishing, purple marsh crabs, ''[[Sesarma reticulatum]]'', can be evicted by the larger green crabs, which prey upon the purple crab. In this way, green crabs can indirectly reduce purple crab herbivory and promotes cordgrass recovery. These results are encouraging because they suggest that invasive species, which are classically considered to have mostly negative impacts on the ecosystems they invade, can sometimes actually contribute to restoring degraded ecosystems.
&lt;ref&gt;Bertness, M. D. and T. C. Coverdale. 2013. An invasive species facilitates the recovery of salt marsh ecosystems on Cape Cod. Ecology 94:1937–1943.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Fungal====

Die-off could potentially be explained by [[pathogens]] of salt marsh plants in some areas - fungal species have been identified at die-off sites in the UK as well as US Atlantic and Gulf coast sites (Elmer 2013).&lt;ref name="Elmer, W.H. 2013"&gt;Elmer, W.H. et al. 2013. Sudden Vegetation Dieback in Atlantic and Gulf Coast Salt Marshes. Plant Disease, 436-445.&lt;/ref&gt; Fungal-facilitated marsh degradation is a documented concern in the Southeast Atlantic in particular. Marsh snails [[Littoraria irrorata]] make minor cuts in the cordgrass during grazing. These cuts facilitate growth of fungus, and at high snail densities, can lead to mass [[infection]]s, increased grazing and consequent die-off (Silliman and Bertness 2002, Silliman and Newell 2003, Silliman et al. 2005).&lt;ref name=sillimanandbertness2002/&gt;&lt;ref name=sillimanetal2005/&gt;&lt;ref name="Silliman B.R. 2003"&gt;Silliman B.R., Newell SY. 2003. Fungal-farming in a snail. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. 100:15643–48.&lt;/ref&gt;

In coastal New England, this evidence is weaker. Certain fungal pathogens of S. alterniflora were found more frequently in sites of die-off. These pathogens have varying degrees of [[virulence]], and there is some evidence of association with species of [[Fusarium]] and areas of die-off. However, although the association suggests a partial causal link, particularly in stress-predisposed plants, strong [[evidence]] is lacking to suggest that such fungal pathogens are a major cause of die-off in New England (Elmer 2013).&lt;ref name="Elmer, W.H. 2013"/&gt;

====Overexploitation====

Overharvesting has led to the collapse of various shallow-water marine [[ecosystems]] around the globe (Jackson et al. 2001),&lt;ref name=jacksonetal2001/&gt; including [[coral reef]]s (Hughes et al. 2003),&lt;ref&gt;Hughes, T. P., et al. 2003. Climate change, human impacts, and the resilience of coral reefs. Science 301:929–933.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Seagrass|sea grass beds]], and [[kelp forest]]s (Estes et al. 1998).&lt;ref name=estesetal1998/&gt;

=====Commercial fishing=====

[[File:Snails eating fungus on cordgrass.png|thumb|border|Marsh snail (''L. irrorata'') eats fungus on cordgrass, killing the plants]]
Research on the salt marsh snail ''[[Littoraria irrorata]]'' and its effects on marsh plant productivity, have provided strong evidence of consumer control in marshes triggered by overexploitation. This snail is capable of turning strands of cordgrass ''(Spartina alterniflora'') (&gt;2.5m tall) into [[mudflat]]s within 8 months, which is less than one growing season (Silliman and Bertness 2002).&lt;ref name=sillimanandbertness2002/&gt; As previously referenced, marsh snails inflict cuts on cordgrass leaves when they graze, providing substratum and nutrients for [[fungus]]. At high snail densities, cordgrass can succumb to fungal [[infection]]s and marsh die-off can ensue (Silliman and Bertness 2002, Silliman and Newell 2003, Silliman et al. 2005).&lt;ref name=sillimanandbertness2002/&gt;&lt;ref name=sillimanetal2005/&gt;&lt;ref name="Silliman B.R. 2003"/&gt; Natural predators of the marsh snail are blue crabs (''Callinectes sapidus'') and terrapin turtles (''Malaclemys terrapin''), which historically regulated snail abundances. However, these predators have been commercially overexploited, and now suffer from diseases due to small population size, releasing the snails from consumer pressure, and allowing the snails to wreak havoc on salt marsh cordgrass populations (Silliman and Zieman 2001).&lt;ref name="sillimanandbertness2002"/&gt;&lt;ref name=sillimanandzieman2001/&gt;

[[File:Enhydra lutris asleep 3.jpg|thumb|border|[[Sea otter]]]]
A classic example of a [[trophic cascade]] was caused by the overexploitation of [[sea otters]] in the 1980s (Estes &amp; Duggins 1995).&lt;ref name=EstesandDuggins1995/&gt; Sea otters eat [[Sea urchins|urchins]], which in turn graze on [[macroalgae]] in a food chain that, when altered, can lead to [[urchin barrens]]. Sea otters in Alaska were hunted to near [[extinction]] for their [[fur|pelts]]. Where sea otter populations have persisted, they suppress the abundance of urchins and thus have an indirect positive effect on the density of macroalgae. In contrast, in sites where sea otters are absent, sea urchin populations have surged and caused urchin barrens to develop. Wherever sea otters have been reinstated, sea urchin populations have been reduced, and kelp densities have increased, returning the habitat to its original healthy state. This example demonstrates the potential for whole-ecosystem recovery with the reestablishment of consumers (Estes and Duggins 1995).&lt;ref name=EstesandDuggins1995/&gt;
 
Other trophic cascades, such as those caused by crabs such as ''[[Chasmagnathus granulata]]'' in South America, are at least in part due to overfishing of top predators (Bortolus and Iribarne 1999, Alberti et al. 2007).&lt;ref name=bortolusandiribarne1999/&gt;&lt;ref name=albertietal2007/&gt;

=====Recreational fishing=====
[[File:Sesarma reticulatum.png|thumb|right|The purple marsh crab, ''[[Sesarma reticulatum]]'']]
In New England, predator depletion has triggered extensive marsh die-off salt marsh creek banks. Herbivory has already impacted up to 90% of creek banks in more than 70% of outer Cape Cod marshes. Absent in 1997, die-off has recently spread into [[Narragansett Bay]], Rhode Island, impacting over 85% of creek banks. The [[nocturnal]] purple marsh crab, ''[[Sesarma reticulatum]]'', is playing a major role in this die-off through increased [[burrowing]] and herbivory due to release from predation pressure. Evidence has pointed to top-down control caused by [[Human impact on the environment|human disturbances]] as the primary agent driving die-off.
 
Altieri and colleagues performed a series of experiments (Altieri et al. 2012)&lt;ref name=altierietal2012&gt;Altieri, A.H., M.D. Bertness, T.C. Coverdale, N.C. Herrmann, C. Angelini. 2012. A trophic cascade triggers collapse of a salt-marsh ecosystem with intensive recreational fishing. Ecology 93(6): 1402-1410.&lt;/ref&gt; designed to elucidate the mechanisms driving marsh die-off more specifically. ''Sesarma'' crabs are normally preyed upon by blue crabs (''[[Callinectes sapidus]]''), and [[fish]] including [[striped bass]] (''[[Morone saxatilis]]'') and [[smooth dogfish]] (''[[Mustelus canis]]''). Although the cascading effects of overfishing have been demonstrated across various ecosystems (Myers and Worm 2003), research on predator depletion has focused almost exclusively on the impact of large-scale commercial overfishing (Worm et al. 2009). However, Altieri and colleagues (2012)&lt;ref name=altierietal2012/&gt; demonstrated that the predators of ''Sesarma'' were, and continue to be, overexploited by recreational [[Angler (fishing)|anglers]]. Their results show that die-off and vegetated marshes differed dramatically in recreational fishing pressure, as anglers were observed only at die-off sites.

Die-off marshes had half the biomass of top-level predators found at vegetated sites, while the biomass of nonharvested consumers did not differ between die-off and vegetated sites. Additionally, the predation rate on ''Sesarma'' at vegetated sites was triple that of die-off sites, and crabs consumed four times more grass at die-off sites than at vegetated sites. Historical reconstructions showed that little net marsh loss (&lt;5%) from 1939-2005 occurred at currently vegetated sites. In contrast, die-off marshes exhibited the onset of die-off in the mid-70s, with consistently increasing vegetation loss through 2005, at which time &gt;20% of the total marsh area was lost to die-off and &gt;80% of the cordgrass zone was unvegetated. This divergence between die-off and vegetated marshes in vegetation loss coincides with a period of rapid increase in the number of docks and boat slips before the mid-70s that resulted in the establishment of &gt;70% of that fishing [[infrastructure]] currently present at die-off marshes. These results provide evidence that ''Sesarma'' release from predation pressure by crabs and fish due to recreational overfishing by anglers is driving a trophic cascade that is responsible for extensive marsh die-off throughout southern New England (Altieri et al. 2012).&lt;ref name=altierietal2012/&gt;
 
[[File:Marsh erosion.png|right|500px|Denuded, eroding salt marsh creek bank]]Altieri and colleagues (2012)&lt;ref name=altierietal2012/&gt; further hypothesized that historic, large-scale, industrialized overexploitation of fish in the northwest Atlantic (Lotze et al. 2006)&lt;ref name=lotzeetal2006/&gt; increased marsh [[vulnerability]] to the effects of localized recreational fishing to the point that large-scale die off ensued, and that resultant localized die-offs could coalesce into complete, region-wide marsh die-off if overexploitation of top consumers continues (Altieri et al. 2012).&lt;ref name=altierietal2012/&gt;

Most recently, Bertness and colleagues (Bertness et al. 2014b)&lt;ref&gt;Bertness, M.D., C. P. Brisson* T. C. Coverdale, M. C. Bevil, S. M. Crotty and E. R. Suglia. 2014 Experimental predator removal causes rapid salt marsh die-off. Ecology Letters 17(7):830–835. doi: 10.1111/ele.12287.&lt;/ref&gt; performed a field experiment excluding predators from plots on the grazing border of the marsh. Within one growing season, exclusion of top predators triggered die-off by increasing the abundances of ''Sesarma'' crabs and the intensity of herbivory. To further test the trophic cascade hypothesis, Bertness and colleagues used the spread of die-off into Narragansett Bay to assess all proposed drivers of die-off, including: 1) eutrophication decreases plant investment into belowground biomass causing plant collapse, 2) boat wakes erode creek banks, 3) pollution or disease affect plant health, 4) substrate hardness controls herbivorous crab distributions and 5) trophic dysfunction releases Sesarma from predator control. Nitrogen availability, wave intensity and plant growth did not explain any variation in die-off. However, herbivory explained over 70% of inter-site variation in die-off. (Bertness et al. 2014a)&lt;ref&gt;Bertness, M. D., C. Brisson, M. Bevil, and S. Crotty. 2014. Herbivory drives the spread of salt marsh die-off. PLoS ONE 9(3): e92916.&lt;/ref&gt; This work highlighted one particular example where top-down interactions were experimentally shown to be the primary driver of ecological community state change.

===Bottom-up interactions===

====Hypersaline and anoxic soils====

One theory of bottom-up control lies with differential [[soil]] [[chemistry]] between vegetated and die-off areas. Drought-associated changes in soil chemistry have been proposed to be associated with areas of die-off. Droughts are often associated with increased [[salinity]] and [[acidity]] [[Stress (biology)|stress]] - soils [[oxidize]] under [[freshwater]] or [[tidal]] [[moisture]] limitation, leading to increased acidity. [[Hypersaline|Hypersalinity]] has been linked to reduced S. alterniflora survival (Brown et al. 2005).&lt;ref&gt;Brown, C.E., S.R. Pezeshki, R.D. DeLaune. The effects of salinity and soil drying on nutrient uptake and growth of ''S. alterniflora'' in a simulated tidal system. Environmental and Experimental Botany 58(1-3): 140-148.&lt;/ref&gt; However, salt marsh plants are generally tolerant of a broad range of salinity levels, and increased salinity has not consistently been observed in die-off sites (Alber et al. 2008).&lt;ref&gt;Alber M., E. Swenson, S. Adamowicz, I. Mendelssohn 2008. Salt marsh dieback: an overview of recent events in the US. [[Estuarine, Coastal and Shelf Science]], 8(1):1-11.&lt;/ref&gt;

There is uncertainty attributed to the link between different soil conditions and sites of die-off for several reasons. First, measurements may not be taken in frequent enough intervals to capture brief fluctuations in soil conditions associated with die-off. Second, attributing [[Causation and correlation|causation]] with changing soil conditions and die-off is potentially dubious. [[Reverse causation|Reverse causality]] is a potential explanation; that is, soil chemistry differences may be a result rather than an agent of die-off. For instance, one study noted higher salinity levels in die-off areas in some months, but this was possibly attributable to altered [[root]] or [[evaporation]] dynamics due to die-off (Marsh 2007). 
 
====Eutrophication====

Nutrient enrichment is a pervasive global threat to both marine and terrestrial ecosystems (Galloway et al. 2008, Verhoeven et al. 2006).&lt;ref&gt;Galloway, J. et al. Transformation of the nitrogen cycle: recent trends, questions and potential solutions. Science 320, 889–892 (2008).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Verhoeven, J. T. et al. Regional and global concerns over wetlands and water quality. Trends Ecol. Evol. 21, 96–103 (2006)&lt;/ref&gt; In marine ecosystems, increased flow of nitrogen can trigger severe algal blooms, anoxic conditions, and widespread fisheries losses (Diaz &amp; Rosenberg 2008).&lt;ref&gt;Diaz, R. J. and R. Rosenberg. Spreading dead zones and consequences for marine ecosystems. Science 321, 926–929 (2008).&lt;/ref&gt; In salt marshes, an important interface ecosystem between land and sea, nutrient addition has been hypothesized to contribute to widespread creek die-offs (Deegan et al. 2012).&lt;ref name=deeganetal2012&gt;Deegan, L.A., Bowen, J.L., Drake, D., Fleeger, J.W., Friedrichs, C.T., Hobbie, J.E., Hopkinson, C., Johnson, D.S., Johnson, J.M., LeMay, L.E., Miller, E., Peterson, B.J., Picard, C., Sheldon, S., Sutherland, M., Vallino, J. and S. Warren. 2012. Coastal eutrophication as a driver of salt marsh loss. Nature 490:388-392.&lt;/ref&gt;
 
To test this hypothesis, Linda Deegan and colleagues performed a nine-year study at one site in Massachusetts. The researchers found that tidal creek enrichment of nitrogen and phosphorus led to decreased investment in belowground nutrient gathering roots and rhizomes, increased microbial decomposition of organic matter, and eventual creek collapse and salt marsh loss (Deegan et al. 2012).&lt;ref name=deeganetal2012/&gt;
 
Similar studies in Connecticut, however, have been unable to replicate these findings. Shimon Anisfeld and Troy Hill performed a 5-year fertilization experiment of a salt marsh in Long Island Sound and found that neither nitrogen nor phosphorus fertilization led to elevation loss, reduced soil carbon, or a decrease in belowground primary production. They suggest that high nutrient levels can significantly alter marsh processes and increase gross carbon loss from sediment but that other processes may compensate for these impacts. No net deleterious effects of nutrient loading on carbon storage or on marsh stability are anticipated from this study (Anisfeld and Hill 2012).&lt;ref&gt;Anisfeld, S. and T. Hill. 2012. Fertilization effects on elevation change and belowground carbon balance in a Long Island Sound tidal marsh. Estuaries and Coasts 35: 201–211.&lt;/ref&gt;
 
Other eutrophication studies performed in Narragansett Bay, Rhode Island found that experimental nitrogen addition initially increases plant productivity but eventually leads to reduced plant biomass due to insect herbivory (Bertness et al. 2008).&lt;ref name=bertnessetal2008/&gt; To supplement this experiment, researchers took surveys across 20 salt marshes to look at the interaction between marsh nutrient levels and herbivore pressure and found that marsh nitrogen supply was a good predictor of herbivore damage to plants. This study suggests that eutrophication is currently triggering consumer suppression of primary productivity in New England salt marshes and may eventually pose a threat to salt marsh ecosystem service provisioning (Bertness et al. 2008).&lt;ref name=bertnessetal2008/&gt;

====Potential for Synergistic effects====

[[Coastal]] ecosystems suffer from a variety of [[Human impact on the environment|anthropogenic impacts]], such as large-scale [[eutrophication]], [[food web]] alteration, runaway consumer effects, [[climate change]], [[habitat destruction]], and [[disease]]. Rarely do these factors act in isolated ways. Often, researchers find additive or [[synergistic]] interactions between impacts compounding the amount of ecosystem [[habitat degradation|degradation]]. One such example is found in salt marshes in the southeastern United States. Depletion of top predators in these systems has led to snail [[overgrazing]] of salt marsh cordgrass and subsequent die-off (as explained above). However, this die-off has been linked with intense drought conditions and the resultant increases in salt and acid stress (Silliman et al. 2005).&lt;ref name=sillimanetal2005/&gt; Drought stress that raises soil salinities and increases cordgrass vulnerabilities to top-down control may be a product of climate change (Silliman and Bertness 2002, Silliman et al. 2005).&lt;ref name=sillimanandbertness2002/&gt;&lt;ref name=sillimanetal2005/&gt; Cases such as these highlight how [[abiotic]] and biotic interactions can interact to affect [[ecosystem health]].

Anthropogenic actions also can cause eutrophication, or increase the nutrient load, of marine ecosystems, through [[Runoff (water)|runoff]] into the system containing [[fertilizer]], [[sewage]], dishwasher soap, and other [[nitrogen]]- and phosphorus-rich substances. Eutrophication is pervasive in coastal marine ecosystems (Lotze et al. 2006)&lt;ref name=lotzeetal2006/&gt; and can indirectly initiate trophic cascades and increase consumer control of plants. For example, insect herbivory in marshes has been positively [[correlated]] with nutrient availability in Atlantic salt marshes (Bertness et al. 2008).&lt;ref name=bertnessetal2008&gt;Bertness, M.D., C.M. Crain, C. Holdredge and N. Sala. 2008. Eutrophication and consumer control of New England salt marsh primary production. Conservation Biology 22: 131-139.&lt;/ref&gt; In Narragansett Bay, insect herbivory suppresses primary production of human disturbed salt marshes by almost 40%. Nitrogen additions through human activity can increase insect herbivory so much that primary production is suppressed by nearly 60%, while marshes without human [[shoreline]] development remain solely under bottom-up control (Bertness et al. 2008).&lt;ref name=bertnessetal2008/&gt; Increased nutrient supply can lead to runaway herbivory in other systems as well (Gough and Grace 1998, Silliman and Zieman 2001).&lt;ref name=sillimanandzieman2001/&gt;&lt;ref name=goughandgrace1998/&gt;
 
For example, eutrophication initiates top-down control via the impact of [[snow geese]] on the [[arctic]] marshes of Hudson Bay (Jefferies 1997).&lt;ref name=jefferies1997/&gt; By the 1980s, the snow geese that originally annually migrated to Hudson Bay had switched from feeding in [[temperate]] [[wetlands]] to feeding in heavily fertilized [[agricultural]] fields. Over a period of 30 years, the geese population exploded. Snow geese have since utterly destroyed hundreds of thousands of acres of the Hudson Bay wetland. The geese grubbed marsh plant roots, evaporation increased leading to subsequent salinity increase, and without plants to [[oxygenate]] the soil the substrate became anoxic. This undesirable [[Environment (biophysical)|environment]] for marsh plants disallows [[Recruitment (biology)|sexual recruitment]] to the area. Snow geese have denuded the marsh until recolonization by [[Ramet|clonal]] runners can restore marsh vegetation, which could take years. Because of the use of [[artificial fertilizer]]s on temperate zone agricultural fields, a trophic cascade was initiated (Jefferies 1997).&lt;ref name=jefferies1997/&gt;

A major goal of ecology over the next century will be to understand how ecosystems will respond to current and future human impacts and the additive or synergistic interactions between them.

==Management implications and conservation==

[[File:Spartina foliosa.jpg|thumb|Cordgrass binds sediment, attenuates waves and prevents shoreline erosion]] [[Ecosystem services]] are the benefits that humans derive from ecological systems. Today, one of the arguments for protecting salt marshes is to increase the quality and quantity of these services. Salt marshes sequester nitrogen, filtering runoff water and reducing nitrogen input to [[estuaries]] (Valiela and Cole 2002).&lt;ref&gt;Valiela I. and M.L. Cole. 2002. Comparative evidence that salt marshes and mangroves may protect seagrass meadows from land-derived nitrogen loads. Ecosystems 5: 92–102.&lt;/ref&gt; Salt marshes also provide essential refuge habitat for young fish and [[crustaceans]], provisioning coastal fisheries (Boesch and Turner 1984)&lt;ref&gt;Boesch D.F. and R.E. Turner. 1984. Dependence of fishery species on salt marshes: the role of food and refuge. Estuaries 7: 460–468.&lt;/ref&gt; that account for 90% of the world’s fish catch (UNEP 2006).&lt;ref&gt;UNEP. 2006. Marine and coastal ecosystems and human well-being: a synthesis report based on the findings of the Millennium Ecosystem Assessment. UNEP.&lt;/ref&gt; Salt marshes also [[sequester carbon]], which will be an important ecosystem service as climate change intensifies (Chmura et al. 2003).&lt;ref&gt;Chmura G.L., S.C. Anisfeld, D.R. Cahoon, and J.C. Lynch. 2003. Global carbon sequestration in tidal, saline wetland soils. Global Biogeochemical Cycles 17: 1111–1133.&lt;/ref&gt; Arguably the most important ecosystem service salt marshes provide is to act as natural sea barriers because grasses bind soils, prevent shoreline [[erosion]], attenuate waves, and reduce coastal [[flooding]] (Costanza et al. 2008).&lt;ref&gt;Costanza R., O. Perez-Maqueo, M.L. Martinez, P. Sutton, S.J. Anderson, and K. Mulder. 2008. The value of coastal wetlands for hurricane protection. Ambio 37: 241–248.&lt;/ref&gt;

However, the marsh’s natural ability to [[Buffer zone|buffer]] against erosion and flooding may be reduced by creek bank die-off. Since Spartina alterniflora is responsible for sediment binding and [[peat]] deposition (Redfield 1965),&lt;ref&gt;Redfield, A.C. 1965 Ontogeny of a salt marsh estuary. Science 147: 50–55.&lt;/ref&gt; cordgrass die-off may compromise the ability of salt marshes to keep pace with [[Sea level rise|sea-level rise]]. Also, the concentration of Sesarma burrows in New England salt marsh peat may directly trigger the erosion and collapse of the peat foundation of marshes.

On Cape Cod, marsh creek banks are often so riddled with ''Sesarma'' burrows that they collapse, exposing fresh peat to further burrowing and erosion (Bertness et al. 2008).&lt;ref name=bertnessetal2008/&gt; Feedbacks between crab herbivory and cordgrass die-off may thus lead to the retreat of marsh edges. For example, Coverdale and colleagues found that 20 years of die-off on Cape Cod have resulted in the loss of over 200 years of marsh accretion and hundreds of acres of marsh loss.&lt;ref&gt;Coverdale, T. C., E. W. Young, S.F. Yin, C. P. Brisson, J. P. Donnelly and M. D. Bertness. 2014. Indirect human impacts reverse centuries of carbon sequestration and salt marsh accretion. PLoS One, 9(3): e93296.&lt;/ref&gt; The detrimental effects trophic cascades have had on marshes not only reduce the [[biodiversity]], health, and aesthetic appeal of these ecosystems, but also compromise the ability of marshes to provide key ecosystem services to human populations.

==Conclusions==

Despite mounting evidence to the contrary, bottom-up control remains the central dogma determining marsh [[Management science|management]], [[Conservation biology|conservation]] and [[Ecosystem restoration|restoration]] efforts. Salt marshes are currently managed as if they are exclusively regulated by physical factors. However, global and near shore top predator depletion leading to the release of cryptic or unappreciated herbivores may be the biggest current threat to salt marshes. Theory dependency (subconscious favoring of identifying and/or examining natural phenomena that tend to confirm rather than refute the current paradigm of a study system [Kuhn 1962]&lt;ref&gt;Kuhn, T. 1962. The structure of scientific revolutions. University of Chicago Press, Chicago, Illinois.&lt;/ref&gt;) and demonstration, rather than falsifying science, have been the leading culprits in this oversight. Consequently, threats to salt marshes that are governed by top down control are being overlooked, with potentially devastating consequences.

Trophic cascades are powerful interactions that strongly regulate [[biodiversity]], community structure, and ecosystem function. Trophic cascades were originally thought to be rare, but it has become clear that they occur across diverse terrestrial, freshwater, and marine ecosystems at both small and large spatial and temporal scales. Trophic cascades are common and pervasive aspects of many communities long thought to be controlled by bottom-up forces and/or resistant to consumer control.
 
Conservation of ecosystems affected by trophic cascades has thus not adequately incorporated top-down control into their management and restoration plans and efforts, but emerging research has emphasized that this is necessary to protect the services provided by these ecosystems and to restore these ecosystems to their original conditions. Failure to do so could lead to trophic cascades transforming highly diverse and productive plant communities to barren flats. 
 
Additionally, failure to reevaluate the current paradigm and recognize that both bottom-up and top-down forces affect many features of ecosystem structure and function, and that these forces are complementary rather than contradictory, could bar any incorporation of both mechanisms into any management plan and reduce the success of conservation efforts before they even begin.

The '''scientific method''' is an [[empirical]] method of knowledge acquisition which has characterized the development of [[science]] since at least the 17th century. It involves careful observation, which includes rigorous [[skepticism]] about what is observed, given that [[Philosophy of science#Observation inseparable from theory|cognitive assumptions]] about how the world works influence how one interprets a [[Perception#Process and terminology|percept]]. It involves formulating [[Hypothesis|hypotheses]], via [[Inductive reasoning|induction]], based on such observations; [[experiment]]al and measurement-based testing of [[Deductive reasoning|deductions]] drawn from the hypotheses; and refinement (or elimination) of the hypotheses based on the experimental findings. These are ''principles'' of the scientific method, as opposed to a definitive series of steps applicable to all scientific enterprises.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Philosophiæ Naturalis Principia Mathematica|last=Newton|first=Issac|work=The Principia: Mathematical Principles of Natural Philosophy|publisher=University of California Press|others=Includes "A Guide to Newton's Principia" by I.

Though there are diverse models for the scientific method available, in general there is a continuous process that includes observations about the natural world. People are naturally inquisitive, so they often come up with questions about things they see or hear, and they often develop ideas or [[hypotheses]] about why things are the way they are. The best hypotheses lead to predictions that can be tested in various ways. The most conclusive testing of hypotheses comes from reasoning based on carefully controlled experimental data. Depending on how well additional tests match the predictions, the original hypothesis may require refinement, alteration, expansion or even rejection. If a particular hypothesis becomes very well supported, a general [[scientific theory|theory]] may be developed.&lt;ref name="Garland2015"&gt;{{cite web | url =http://idea.ucr.edu/documents/flash/scientific_method/story.htm | title =The Scientific Method as an Ongoing Process | date= 20 March 2015 | last =Garland, Jr. | first =Theodore | publisher =UC Riverside | archive-url =https://web.archive.org/web/20160819164005/http://idea.ucr.edu/documents/flash/scientific_method/story.htm | archive-date =19 August 2016 |deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although procedures vary from one [[Branches of science|field of inquiry]] to another, they are frequently the same from one to another. The process of the scientific method involves making [[conjecture]]s (hypotheses), deriving predictions from them as logical consequences, and then carrying out experiments or empirical observations based on those predictions.&lt;ref name=NA /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;See, for example, {{harvnb|Galileo|1638}}. His [[thought experiment]]s disprove Aristotle's physics of falling bodies, in ''[[Two New Sciences]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; A hypothesis is a conjecture, based on knowledge obtained while seeking answers to the question. The hypothesis might be very specific, or it might be broad. Scientists then test hypotheses by conducting experiments or studies. A scientific hypothesis must be [[falsifiable]], implying that it is possible to identify a possible outcome of an experiment or observation that conflicts with predictions deduced from the hypothesis; otherwise, the hypothesis cannot be meaningfully tested.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Popper|1959|p=273}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The purpose of an experiment is to determine whether [[observation]]s agree with or conflict with the predictions derived from a hypothesis.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Karl R. Popper, ''Conjectures and Refutations: The Growth of Scientific Knowledge'', Routledge, 2003 {{ISBN|0415285941}}&lt;/ref&gt; Experiments can take place anywhere from a garage to CERN's [[Large Hadron Collider]]. There are difficulties in a formulaic statement of method, however. Though the scientific method is often presented as a fixed sequence of steps, it represents rather a set of general principles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1= Gauch |first1= Hugh G. |title=Scientific Method in Practice |url=https://books.google.com/?id=iVkugqNG9dAC |edition=Reprint |publisher=Cambridge University Press |date=2003 |page=3 |isbn=978-0521017084 |quote=The scientific method 'is often misrepresented as a fixed sequence of steps,' rather than being seen for what it truly is, 'a highly variable and creative process' (AAAS 2000:18). The claim here is that science has general principles that must be mastered to increase productivity and enhance perspective, not that these principles provide a simple and automated sequence of steps to follow.}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Not all steps take place in every scientific inquiry (nor to the same degree), and they are not always in the same order.&lt;ref name=Gauch2003 /&gt;&lt;ref name="Inductive Science 1837"&gt;[[William Whewell]], ''History of Inductive Science'' (1837), and in ''Philosophy of Inductive Science'' (1840)&lt;/ref&gt;  Some philosophers and scientists have argued that there is no scientific method; they include physicist [[Lee Smolin]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://bigthink.com/in-their-own-words/there-is-no-scientific-method |title=There is No Scientific Method |last1=Smolin |first1=Lee |access-date=2016-06-07|date=May 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and philosopher [[Paul Feyerabend]] (in his ''[[Against Method]]''). Robert Nola and Howard Sankey remark that "For some, the whole idea of a theory of scientific method is yester-year's debate, the continuation of which can be summed up as yet more of the proverbial deceased equine castigation. We beg to differ."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|date=2001 |title=After Popper, Kuhn and Feyerabend.

Important debates in the history of science concern [[rationalism]], especially as advocated by [[René Descartes]]; [[inductivism]] and/or [[empiricism]], as argued for by [[Francis Bacon]], and rising to particular prominence with [[Isaac Newton]] and his followers; and [[hypothetico-deductivism]], which came to the fore in the early 19th century.

The term "scientific method" did not come into wide use until the 19th century, when other modern scientific terminologies began to emerge such as "scientist" and "pseudoscience" and significant transformation of science was taking place.&lt;ref name="Thurs" /&gt; Throughout the 1830s and 1850s, by which time Baconianism was popular, naturalists like William Whewell, John Herschel, John Stuart Mill engaged in debates over "induction" and "facts" and were focused on how to generate knowledge.&lt;ref name="Thurs" /&gt; In the late 19th a debate over [[Philosophical realism|realism]] vs. [[antirealism]] was conducted as powerful scientific theories extended beyond the realm of the observable.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{cite book |author=Achinstein, Peter |title=General Introduction |pages=1–5 |work=Science Rules: A Historical Introduction to Scientific Methods |publisher=Johns Hopkins University Press |date=2004 |isbn=978-0801879432}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term "scientific method" came to be used prominently in the twentieth century, with no scientific authorities over its meaning despite it popping up in textbooks and dictionaries.&lt;ref name="Thurs"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Thurs|first1=Daniel|editor1-last=Shank|editor1-first=Michael|editor2-last=Numbers|editor2-first=Ronald|editor3-last=Harrison|editor3-first=Peter|title=Wrestling with Nature : From Omens to Science|date=2011|publisher=University of Chicago Press|location=Chicago|isbn=978-0226317830|page=307–36|chapter=12. Scientific Method}}&lt;/ref&gt; Though there was a steady growth on the concept into the twentieth century, by the end of that century numerous influential philosophers of science like Thomas Kuhn and Paul Feyerabend had questioned the universality of the "scientific method" and in doing so largely replaced the notion of science as a homogeneous and universal method with that of it being a heterogeneous and local practice.&lt;ref name="Thurs" /&gt; In particular, Paul Feyerabend argued against there being any universal rules of [[science]].&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;

==Overview==
{{hatnote|The [[#DNA example|DNA example]] below is a synopsis of this method.}}

The scientific method is the process by which [[science]] is carried out.&lt;ref&gt;" The thesis of this book, as set forth in Chapter One, is that there are general principles applicable to all the sciences." __ {{harvnb| Gauch | 2003 |p= xv}}&lt;/ref&gt; As in other areas of inquiry, science (through the scientific method) can build on previous knowledge and develop a more sophisticated understanding of its topics of study over time.&lt;ref name=Fixation/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb| Gauch | 2003 |p=1 }} The scientific method can function in the same way; This is the principle of noncontradiction.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Francis Bacon]](1629) ''[[New Organon]]'', lists 4 types of error: Idols of the tribe (error due to the entire human race), the cave (errors due to an individual's own intellect), the marketplace (errors due to false words), and the theater (errors due to incredulous acceptance).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Vital/&gt;&lt;ref name=Anti-fragility/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;For example, the concept of [[Falsifiability|falsification]] (first proposed in 1934) formalizes the attempt to ''disprove'' hypotheses rather than prove them. ''Karl R. Popper (1963), 'The Logic of Scientific Discovery'. [http://www.cosmopolitanuniversity.ac/library/LogicofScientificDiscoveryPopper1959.pdf The Logic of Scientific Discovery] pp. 17–20, 249–52, 437–38, and elsewhere.''
* [[Leon Lederman]], for teaching [[physics first]], illustrates how to avoid confirmation bias: [[Ian Shelton]], in Chile, was initially skeptical that [[supernova 1987a]] was real, but possibly an artifact of instrumentation (null hypothesis), so he went outside and disproved his null hypothesis by observing SN 1987a with the naked eye. The [[Kamiokande]] experiment, in Japan, independently observed [[neutrino]]s from [[SN 1987a]] at the same time.&lt;/ref&gt; This model can be seen to underlie the [[scientific revolution]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Lindberg|2007|pp=2–3}}: "There is a danger that must be avoided. ... If we wish to do justice to the historical enterprise, we must take the past for what it was. And that means we must resist the temptation to scour the past for examples or precursors of modern science. ...My concern will be with the beginnings of scientific ''theories'', the methods by which they were formulated, and the uses to which they were put; ... "&lt;/ref&gt;

The ubiquitous element in the model of the scientific method is [[empiricism]], or more precisely, epistemologic [[sensualism]]. This is in opposition to stringent forms of [[rationalism]]: the scientific method embodies that reason alone cannot solve a particular scientific problem. A strong formulation of the scientific method is not always aligned with a form of [[empiricism]] in which the empirical data is put forward in the form of experience or other abstracted forms of knowledge; in current scientific practice, however, the use of [[scientific modelling]] and reliance on abstract typologies and theories is normally accepted. The scientific method is of necessity also an expression of an opposition to claims that e.g. [[revelation]], political or religious [[dogma]], appeals to tradition, commonly held beliefs, common sense, or, importantly, currently held theories, are the only possible means of demonstrating truth.

Different early expressions of empiricism and the scientific method can be found throughout history, for instance with the ancient [[Stoics]], [[Epicurus]],&lt;ref name=Asmis&gt;Elizabeth Asmis (1985) ''Epicurus' Scientific Method''. Cornell University Press &lt;/ref&gt; [[Alhazen]],&lt;ref name="Alhazen"&gt;[[Alhazen]] argued the importance of forming questions and subsequently testing them: "How does light travel through transparent bodies? Light travels through transparent bodies in straight lines only.... We have explained this exhaustively in our ''[[Book of Optics]]''. But let us now mention something to prove this convincingly: the fact that light travels in straight lines is clearly observed in the lights which enter into dark rooms through holes.... [T]he entering light will be clearly observable in the dust which fills the air. – Alhazen, ''Treatise on Light'' (رسالة في الضوء), translated into English from German by M. Schwarz, from [http://menadoc.bibliothek.uni-halle.de/dmg/periodical/pageview/30949 "Abhandlung über das Licht"], J. Baarmann (editor and translator from Arabic to German, 1882) ''[[Zeitschrift der Deutschen Morgenländischen Gesellschaft]]'' Vol '''36''' as quoted in {{harvnb|Sambursky|1974|p=136}}.
* He demonstrated his conjecture that "light travels through transparent bodies in straight lines only" by placing a straight stick or a taut thread next to the light beam, as quoted in {{harvnb|Sambursky|1974|p=136}} to prove that light travels in a straight line.
* [[David Hockney]], (2001, 2006) in ''Secret Knowledge: rediscovering the lost techniques of the old masters'' {{ISBN|0142005126}} (expanded edition) cites Alhazen several times as the likely source for the portraiture technique using the [[camera obscura]], which Hockney rediscovered with the aid of an optical suggestion from [[Charles M. Falco]]. ''Kitab al-Manazir'', which is Alhazen's ''[[Book of Optics]]'', at that time denoted ''Opticae Thesaurus, Alhazen Arabis'', was translated from Arabic into Latin for European use as early as 1270. Hockney cites Friedrich Risner's 1572 Basle edition of ''Opticae Thesaurus''. Hockney quotes Alhazen as the first clear description of the camera obscura in Hockney, p. 240.
"Truth is sought for its own sake. And those who are engaged upon the quest for anything for its own sake are not interested in other things. Finding the truth is difficult, and the road to it is rough." – [[Alhazen]] ([[Ibn Al-Haytham]] 965 – c. 1040) ''[[Critique of Ptolemy]]'', translated by S. Pines, ''Actes X Congrès internationale d'histoire des sciences'', Vol '''I''' Ithaca 1962, as quoted in {{harvnb|Sambursky|1974|p=139}}.

Kepler was driven to this experiment after observing the partial solar eclipse at Graz, July 10, 1600. He used Tycho Brahe's method of observation, which was to project the image of the Sun on a piece of paper through a pinhole aperture, instead of looking directly at the Sun. He disagreed with Brahe's conclusion that total eclipses of the Sun were impossible, because there were historical accounts of total eclipses. Instead he deduced that the size of the aperture controls the sharpness of the projected image (the larger the aperture, the more accurate the image&amp;nbsp;– this fact is now fundamental for optical system design). Voelkel, p. 61, notes that Kepler's experiments produced the first correct account of vision and the eye, because he realized he could not accurately write about astronomical observation by ignoring the eye.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Galileo Galilei]].&lt;ref&gt;...an approach which was advocated by Galileo in 1638 with the publication of ''[[Two New Sciences]]''.{{Citation|last=Galilei|first=Galileo|author-link=Galileo|title=Discorsi e Dimonstrazioni Matematiche, intorno a due nuoue scienze|location=[[Leiden|Leida]]|publisher=Apresso gli [[House of Elzevir|Elsevirri]]|year=1638|isbn=978-0486600994|title-link=Two New Sciences}}, Dover reprint of the 1914 Macmillan translation by Henry Crew and Alfonso de Salvio of ''Two New Sciences'', [[Galileo Galilei]] [[Accademia dei Lincei|Linceo]] (1638).

The overall process involves making [[conjectures]] ([[Hypothesis|hypotheses]]), deriving predictions from them as logical consequences, and then carrying out experiments based on those predictions to determine whether the original [[conjecture]] was correct.&lt;ref name=NA /&gt; There are difficulties in a formulaic statement of method, however. Though the scientific method is often presented as a fixed sequence of steps, these actions are better considered as general principles.&lt;ref name=Gauch2003&gt;{{harvnb|Gauch |2003|p=3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Not all steps take place in every scientific inquiry (nor to the same degree), and they are not always done in the same order. As noted by scientist and philosopher [[William Whewell]] (1794–1866), "invention, sagacity, [and] genius"&lt;ref name="Inductive Science 1837"/&gt; are required at every step.

====Formulation of a question====
The question can refer to the explanation of a specific [[observation]], as in "Why is the sky blue?" but can also be open-ended, as in "How can I [[Drug design|design a drug]] to cure this particular disease?" This stage frequently involves finding and evaluating evidence from previous experiments, personal scientific observations or assertions, as well as the work of other scientists. If the answer is already known, a different question that builds on the evidence can be posed. When applying the scientific method to research, determining a good question can be very difficult and it will affect the outcome of the investigation.&lt;ref&gt;Schuster and Powers (2005), Translational and Experimental Clinical Research, Ch. 1. [https://books.google.com/?id=C7pZftbI0ZMC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=Translational+and+Experimental+Clinical+Research Link.] This chapter also discusses the different types of research questions and how they are produced.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Hypothesis====
A [[hypothesis]] is a [[conjecture]], based on knowledge obtained while formulating the question, that may explain any given behavior. The hypothesis might be very specific; for example, Einstein's [[equivalence principle]] or [[Francis Crick]]'s "DNA makes RNA makes protein",&lt;ref&gt;This phrasing is attributed to [[Marshall Nirenberg]].&lt;/ref&gt; or it might be broad; for example, unknown species of life dwell in the unexplored depths of the oceans. A [[Statistical hypothesis testing#Definition of terms|statistical hypothesis]] is a [[conjecture]] about a given [[statistical population]]. For example, the population might be ''people with a particular disease.'' The conjecture might be that a new drug will cure the disease in some of those people. Terms commonly associated with statistical hypotheses are [[null hypothesis]] and [[alternative hypothesis]]. A null hypothesis is the conjecture that the statistical hypothesis is false; for example, that the new drug does nothing and that any cure is caused by [[Luck|chance]]. Researchers normally want to show that the null hypothesis is false. The alternative hypothesis is the desired outcome, that the drug does better than chance. A final point: a scientific hypothesis must be [[falsifiable]], meaning that one can identify a possible outcome of an experiment that conflicts with predictions deduced from the hypothesis; otherwise, it cannot be meaningfully tested.

====Prediction====
This step involves determining the logical consequences of the hypothesis. One or more predictions are then selected for further testing. The more unlikely that a prediction would be correct simply by coincidence, then the more convincing it would be if the prediction were fulfilled; evidence is also stronger if the answer to the prediction is not already known, due to the effects of [[hindsight bias]] (see also [[postdiction]]). Ideally, the prediction must also distinguish the hypothesis from likely alternatives; if two hypotheses make the same prediction, observing the prediction to be correct is not evidence for either one over the other. (These statements about the relative strength of evidence can be mathematically derived using [[Bayes' Theorem]]).&lt;ref&gt;Note: for a discussion of multiple hypotheses, see [[Bayesian inference#Informal]]&lt;/ref&gt;

====Testing====
This is an investigation of whether the real world behaves as predicted by the hypothesis. Scientists (and other people) test hypotheses by conducting [[experiment]]s. The purpose of an experiment is to determine whether [[observations]] of the real world agree with or conflict with the predictions derived from a hypothesis. If they agree, confidence in the hypothesis increases; otherwise, it decreases. Agreement does not assure that the hypothesis is true; future experiments may reveal problems. [[Karl Popper]] advised scientists to try to falsify hypotheses, i.e., to search for and test those experiments that seem most doubtful. Large numbers of successful confirmations are not convincing if they arise from experiments that avoid risk.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; Experiments should be designed to minimize possible errors, especially through the use of appropriate [[scientific control]]s. For example, tests of medical treatments are commonly run as [[Blind experiment#Double-blind trials|double-blind tests]]. Test personnel, who might unwittingly reveal to test subjects which samples are the desired test drugs and which are [[placebo]]s, are kept ignorant of which are which. Such hints can bias the responses of the test subjects. Furthermore, failure of an experiment does not necessarily mean the hypothesis is false. Experiments always depend on several hypotheses, e.g., that the test equipment is working properly, and a failure may be a failure of one of the auxiliary hypotheses. (See the [[Duhem–Quine thesis]].) Experiments can be conducted in a college lab, on a kitchen table, at CERN's [[Large Hadron Collider]], at the bottom of an ocean, on Mars (using one of the working [[Mars rover|rovers]]), and so on. Astronomers do experiments, searching for planets around distant stars. Finally, most individual experiments address highly specific topics for reasons of practicality. As a result, evidence about broader topics is usually accumulated gradually.

====Analysis====
This involves determining what the results of the experiment show and deciding on the next actions to take. The predictions of the hypothesis are compared to those of the null hypothesis, to determine which is better able to explain the data. In cases where an experiment is repeated many times, a [[Statistics|statistical analysis]] such as a [[chi-squared test]] may be required. If the evidence has falsified the hypothesis, a new hypothesis is required; if the experiment supports the hypothesis but the evidence is not strong enough for high confidence, other predictions from the hypothesis must be tested. Once a hypothesis is strongly supported by evidence, a new question can be asked to provide further insight on the same topic. Evidence from other scientists and experience are frequently incorporated at any stage in the process. Depending on the complexity of the experiment, many iterations may be required to gather sufficient evidence to answer a question with confidence, or to build up many answers to highly specific questions in order to answer a single broader question.

===DNA example===
[[File:DNA icon (25x25).png|link=|alt=]]
The basic [[#Elements of the scientific method|elements of the scientific method]] are illustrated by the following example from the discovery of the structure of [[DNA]]:
* ''[[#DNA-characterizations|Question]]'': Previous investigation of DNA had determined its chemical composition (the four [[nucleotides]]), the structure of each individual nucleotide, and other properties. It had been identified as the carrier of genetic information by the [[Avery–MacLeod–McCarty experiment]] in 1944,&lt;ref name="harvnb|McCarty1985"&gt;{{harvnb|McCarty1985}}&lt;/ref&gt; but the mechanism of how genetic information was stored in DNA was unclear.
* ''[[#DNA-hypotheses|Hypothesis]]'': [[Linus Pauling]], [[Francis Crick]] and [[James D. Watson]] hypothesized that DNA had a helical structure.&lt;ref&gt;October 1951, as noted in {{harvnb|McElheny|2004|p=40}}:"That's what a helix should look like!" Crick exclaimed in delight (This is the Cochran-Crick-Vand-Stokes theory of the transform of a helix).&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''[[#DNA-predictions|Prediction]]'': If DNA had a helical structure, its X-ray diffraction pattern would be X-shaped.&lt;ref&gt;June 1952, as noted in {{harvnb|McElheny|2004|p=43}}: Watson had succeeded in getting X-ray pictures of TMV showing a diffraction pattern consistent with the transform of a helix.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Crick pp. 137–138"&gt;Watson did enough work on [[Tobacco mosaic virus]] to produce the diffraction pattern for a helix, per Crick's work on the transform of a helix. pp. 137–38, Horace Freeland Judson (1979) ''The Eighth Day of Creation'' {{ISBN|0671225405}}&lt;/ref&gt; This prediction was determined using the mathematics of the helix transform, which had been derived by Cochran, Crick and Vand&lt;ref name="HelixTransform"&gt;–
Cochran W, Crick FHC and Vand V. (1952) "The Structure of Synthetic Polypeptides. I. The Transform of Atoms on a Helix", ''[[Acta Crystallographica|Acta Crystallogr.]]'', '''5''', 581–86.&lt;/ref&gt; (and independently by Stokes). This prediction was a mathematical construct, completely independent from the biological problem at hand.
* ''[[#DNA-experiments|Experiment]]'': [[Rosalind Franklin]] crystallized pure DNA and performed [[X-ray diffraction]] to produce [[photo 51]]. The results showed an X-shape.
* ''[[#DNA-iterations|Analysis]]'': When Watson saw the detailed diffraction pattern, he immediately recognized it as a helix.&lt;ref name="TeaTime"&gt;Friday, January 30, 1953. Tea time, as noted in {{harvnb|McElheny|2004|p=52}}: Franklin confronts Watson and his paper – "Of course it [Pauling's pre-print] is wrong. DNA is not a helix." However, Watson then visits Wilkins' office, sees [[photo 51]], and immediately recognizes the diffraction pattern of a helical structure. But additional questions remained, requiring additional iterations of their research. For example, the number of strands in the backbone of the helix (Crick suspected 2 strands, but cautioned Watson to examine that more critically), the location of the base pairs (inside the backbone or outside the backbone), etc. One key point was that they realized that the quickest way to reach a result was not to continue a mathematical analysis, but to build a physical model.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Watson 1968 167"&gt;"The instant I saw the picture my mouth fell open and my pulse began to race." – {{harvnb|Watson|1968|p=167}} Page 168 shows the X-shaped pattern of the B-form of [[DNA]], clearly indicating crucial details of its helical structure to Watson and Crick.
* {{harvnb|McElheny|2004}} p. 52 dates the Franklin-Watson confrontation as Friday, January 30, 1953. Later that evening, Watson urges Wilkins to begin model-building immediately. But Wilkins agrees to do so only after Franklin's departure.&lt;/ref&gt; He and Crick then produced their model, using this information along with the previously known information about DNA's composition and about molecular interactions such as [[hydrogen bonds]].&lt;ref name="SameShape"&gt;Saturday, February 28, 1953, as noted in {{harvnb|McElheny|2004|pp=57–59}}: Watson found the base pairing mechanism which explained [[Chargaff's rules]] using his cardboard models.&lt;/ref&gt;

The discovery became the starting point for many further studies involving the genetic material, such as the field of [[molecular genetics]], and it was awarded the [[Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine|Nobel Prize]] in 1962. Each step of the example is examined in more detail later in the article.

===Other components===
The scientific method also includes other components required even when all the iterations of the steps above have been completed:&lt;ref&gt;[[Galileo Galilei]] (1638) ''[[Two new sciences]]''&lt;/ref&gt;

====Replication====
If an experiment cannot be [[Reproducibility|repeated]] to produce the same results, this implies that the original results might have been in error. As a result, it is common for a single experiment to be performed multiple times, especially when there are uncontrolled variables or other indications of [[Observational error|experimental error]]. For significant or surprising results, other scientists may also attempt to replicate the results for themselves, especially if those results would be important to their own work.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fyysika.ee/vorgustik/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/Reconstruction-of-Galileo-Galilei.pdf|title=Reconstruction of Galileo Galilei's experiment – the inclined plane|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====External review====
The process of [[peer review]] involves evaluation of the experiment by experts, who typically give their opinions anonymously. Some journals request that the experimenter provide lists of possible peer reviewers, especially if the field is highly specialized. Peer review does not certify correctness of the results, only that, in the opinion of the reviewer, the experiments themselves were sound (based on the description supplied by the experimenter). If the work passes peer review, which occasionally may require new experiments requested by the reviewers, it will be published in a peer-reviewed [[Academic journal|scientific journal]]. The specific journal that publishes the results indicates the perceived quality of the work.&lt;ref&gt;In ''Two new sciences'', there are three 'reviewers': Simplicio, Sagredo, and Salviati, who serve as foil, antagonist, and protagonist. Galileo speaks for himself only briefly. But note that Einstein's 1905 papers were not peer reviewed before their publication.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Data recording and sharing====
Scientists typically are careful in recording their data, a requirement promoted by [[Ludwik Fleck]] (1896–1961) and others.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Fleck|1979|pp=xxvii–xxviii}}&lt;/ref&gt; Though not typically required, they might be requested to [[Data sharing|supply this data]] to other scientists who wish to replicate their original results (or parts of their original results), extending to the sharing of any experimental samples that may be difficult to obtain.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://grants.nih.gov/grants/policy/data_sharing/index.htm NIH Data Sharing Policy]."&lt;/ref&gt;

==Scientific inquiry==
Scientific inquiry generally aims to obtain [[knowledge]] in the form of [[Scientific theory|testable explanations]] that scientists can use to
[[Predictability|predict]] the results of future experiments. This allows scientists to gain a better understanding of the topic under study, and later to use that understanding to intervene in its causal mechanisms (such as to cure disease). The better an explanation is at making predictions, the more useful it frequently can be, and the more likely it will continue to explain a body of evidence better than its alternatives. The most successful explanations – those which explain and make accurate predictions in a wide range of circumstances – are often called [[scientific theories]].

Most experimental results do not produce large changes in human understanding; improvements in theoretical scientific understanding typically result from a gradual process of development over time, sometimes across different domains of science.&lt;ref&gt;Stanovich, Keith E. (2007). ''How to Think Straight About Psychology''. Boston: Pearson Education. p. 123&lt;/ref&gt; Scientific models vary in the extent to which they have been experimentally tested and for how long, and in their acceptance in the scientific community. In general, explanations become accepted over time as evidence accumulates on a given topic, and the explanation in question proves more powerful than its alternatives at explaining the evidence. Often subsequent researchers re-formulate the explanations over time, or combined explanations to produce new explanations.

Tow sees the scientific method in terms of an [[evolutionary algorithm]] applied to science and technology.&lt;ref&gt;

[...] Of great significance is the evolutionary algorithm, which uses a simplified subset of the process of natural evolution applied to find the solution to problems that are too complex to solve by traditional analytic methods. In essence it is a process of accelerated and rigorous trial and error building on previous knowledge to refine an existing hypothesis, or discarding it altogether to find a better model. [...] The evolutionary algorithm is a technique derived from the evolution of knowledge processing applied within the context of science and technology, itself an outcome of evolution. The scientific method continues to evolve through adaptive reward, trial and error and application of the method to itself.

&lt;/ref&gt;

===Properties of scientific inquiry===

Scientific knowledge is closely tied to [[empirical]] findings, and can remain subject to [[falsifiability|falsification]] if new experimental observation incompatible with it is found. That is, no theory can ever be considered final, since new problematic evidence might be discovered. If such evidence is found, a new theory may be proposed, or (more commonly) it is found that modifications to the previous theory are sufficient to explain the new evidence. The strength of a theory can be argued{{by whom|date=December 2016}} to relate to how long it has persisted without major alteration to its core principles.

Theories can also become subsumed by other theories. For example, Newton's laws explained thousands of years of scientific observations of the planets   [[#Another example: precession of Mercury|almost perfectly]]. However, these laws were then determined to be special cases of a more general theory ([[Theory of relativity|relativity]]), which explained both the (previously unexplained) exceptions to Newton's laws and predicted and explained other observations such as the deflection of [[light]] by [[gravity]]. Thus, in certain cases independent, unconnected, scientific observations can be connected to each other, unified by principles of increasing explanatory power.&lt;ref name="Brody 1993 44–45"&gt;{{harvnb|Brody |1993|pp= 44–45}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Goldhaber 2010 page=942"/&gt;

Since new theories might be more comprehensive than what preceded them, and thus be able to explain more than previous ones, successor theories might be able to meet a higher standard by explaining a larger body of observations than their predecessors.&lt;ref name="Brody 1993 44–45"/&gt; For example, the theory of [[evolution]] explains the [[Biodiversity|diversity of life on Earth]], how species adapt to their environments, and many other patterns observed in the natural world;&lt;ref name="Hall08"&gt;{{cite book |editor1-last = Hall |editor1-first = B.K. |editor2-last = Hallgrímsson |editor2-first = B. |title = Strickberger's Evolution |year = 2008 |edition = 4th |publisher = Jones &amp; Bartlett |isbn = 978-0763700669 |url = http://www.jblearning.com/catalog/9780763700669/ |page = 762 |deadurl = yes |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20120628101715/http://www.jblearning.com/catalog/9780763700669/ |archivedate = 2012-06-28 |df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Cracraft05"&gt;{{cite book | editor1-last= Cracraft | editor1-first= J. | editor2-last= Donoghue | editor2-first= M.J. |title = Assembling the tree of life | publisher = Oxford University Press | year = 2005 | page = 592 | isbn = 978-0195172348 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=6lXTP0YU6_kC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=Assembling+the+tree+of+life#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false }}&lt;/ref&gt; its most recent major modification was unification with [[genetics]] to form the [[Extended evolutionary synthesis|modern evolutionary synthesis]]. In subsequent modifications, it has also subsumed aspects of many other fields such as [[biochemistry]] and [[molecular biology]].

===Beliefs and biases===
[[File:Jean Louis Théodore Géricault 001.jpg|thumb|Flying gallop as shown by this painting ([[Théodore Géricault]], 1821) is [[Falsifiability|falsified]]; see image below]]
[[File:The Horse in Motion high res.jpg|thumb|[[Sallie Gardner at a Gallop|Muybridge's photographs]] of ''The Horse in Motion,'' 1878, were used to answer the question whether all four feet of a galloping horse are ever off the ground at the same time. This demonstrates a use of photography as an experimental tool in science.]]

Scientific methodology often directs that [[Hypothesis|hypotheses]] be tested in [[Scientific control|controlled]] conditions wherever possible. This is frequently possible in certain areas, such as in the biological sciences, and more difficult in other areas, such as in astronomy.

The practice of experimental control and reproducibility can have the effect of diminishing the potentially harmful effects of circumstance, and to a degree, personal bias. For example, pre-existing beliefs can alter the interpretation of results, as in [[confirmation bias]]; this is a [[heuristic]] that leads a person with a particular belief to see things as reinforcing their belief, even if another observer might disagree (in other words, people tend to observe what they expect to observe).

A historical example is the belief that the legs of a [[Horse gallop|galloping]] horse are splayed at the point when none of the horse's legs touches the ground, to the point of this image being included in paintings by its supporters. However, the first stop-action pictures of a horse's gallop by [[Eadweard Muybridge]] showed this to be false, and that the legs are instead gathered together.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Needham|Wang|1954}} p. 166 shows how the 'flying gallop' image propagated from China to the West.&lt;/ref&gt;

Another important human bias that plays a role is a preference for new, surprising statements (see [[appeal to novelty]]), which can result in a search for evidence that the new is true.&lt;ref name="Goldhaber 2010 page=940"&gt;{{harvnb|Goldhaber|Nieto|2010|page=940}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Poorly attested beliefs can be believed and acted upon via a less rigorous heuristic.&lt;ref&gt;"A myth is a belief given uncritical acceptance by members of a group ..." – Weiss, ''Business Ethics'' p. 15, as cited by Ronald R. Sims (2003) ''Ethics and corporate social responsibility: why giants fall'' p. 21&lt;/ref&gt;

Goldhaber and Nieto published in 2010 the observation that if theoretical structures with "many closely neighboring subjects are described by connecting theoretical concepts then the theoretical structure .. becomes increasingly hard to overturn".&lt;ref name="Goldhaber 2010 page=942"&gt;{{harvnb|Goldhaber|Nieto|2010|page=942}}&lt;/ref&gt; When a narrative is constructed its elements become easier to believe.&lt;ref&gt;[[Imre Lakatos]] (1976), ''[[Proofs and Refutations]]''. {{harvnb|Taleb|2007|p=72}} lists ways to avoid the narrative fallacy and confirmation bias.&lt;/ref&gt; For more on the [[narrative fallacy]], see also {{harvnb|Fleck|1979|p=27}}: "Words and ideas are originally phonetic and mental equivalences of the experiences coinciding with them. ... Such proto-ideas are at first always too broad and insufficiently specialized. ... Once a structurally complete and closed system of opinions consisting of many details and relations has been formed, it offers enduring resistance to anything that contradicts it." Sometimes, these have their elements assumed [[A priori and a posteriori|''a priori'']], or contain some other logical or methodological flaw in the process that ultimately produced them. [[Donald M. MacKay]] has analyzed these elements in terms of limits to the accuracy of measurement and has related them to instrumental elements in a category of measurement.&lt;ref&gt;
The scientific method requires testing and validation [[Empirical evidence|''a posteriori'']] before ideas are accepted. "Invariably one came up against fundamental physical limits to the accuracy of measurement. ... The art of physical measurement seemed to be a matter of compromise, of choosing between reciprocally related uncertainties. ... Multiplying together the conjugate pairs of uncertainty limits mentioned, however, I found that they formed invariant products of not one but two distinct kinds. ... The first group of limits were calculable ''a priori'' from a specification of the instrument. The second group could be calculated only ''a posteriori'' from a specification of what was ''done'' with the instrument. ... In the first case each unit [of information] would add one additional ''dimension'' (conceptual category), whereas in the second each unit would add one additional ''atomic fact''.", pp. 1–4: MacKay, Donald M. (1969), ''Information, Mechanism, and Meaning'', Cambridge, MA: MIT Press, {{ISBN|026263032X}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

==Elements of the scientific method==
There are different ways of outlining the basic method used for scientific inquiry. The [[scientific community]] and [[philosophers of science]] generally agree on the following classification of method components. These methodological elements and organization of procedures tend to be more characteristic of [[natural science]]s than [[social science]]s. Nonetheless, the cycle of formulating hypotheses, testing and analyzing the results, and formulating new hypotheses, will resemble the cycle described below.

The scientific method is an iterative, cyclical process through which information is continually revised.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Godfrey-Smith|first1=Peter|title=Theory and Reality: An Introduction to the Philosophy of Science|date=2009|publisher=University of Chicago Press|location=Chicago|isbn=978-0226300627|url=https://books.google.com/?id=k23egtSWrb8C}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Brody|first1=Thomas A.|title=The Philosophy Behind Physics|date=1993|publisher=Springer-Verlag|location=Berlin; New York|isbn=978-3540559146|url=https://books.google.com/?id=zmHrCAAAQBAJ}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is generally recognized to develop advances in knowledge through the following elements, in varying combinations or contributions:&lt;ref name="Kuhn50"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Kuhn|first1=Thomas S.|title=The Structure of Scientific Revolutions|date=2012|publisher=University of Chicago Press|location=Chicago|isbn=978-0226458113|edition=50th Anniversary|url=https://books.google.com/books/aout/The_Structure_of_Scientific_Revolutions.html?id=3eP5Y_OOuzwC|accessdate=29 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Galison"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Galison|first1=Peter|title=How Experiments End|date=1987|publisher=University of Chicago Press|location=Chicago|isbn=978-0226279152|url=https://books.google.com/books/about/How_Experiments_End.html?id=DN-9m2jSo8YC|accessdate=29 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Characterizations (observations, definitions, and measurements of the subject of inquiry)
* Hypotheses (theoretical, hypothetical explanations of observations and measurements of the subject)
* Predictions (inductive and deductive reasoning from the hypothesis or theory)
* Experiments (tests of all of the above)

Each element of the scientific method is subject to [[peer review]] for possible mistakes. These activities do not describe all that scientists do ([[#Dimensions of practice|see below]]) but apply mostly to experimental sciences (e.g., physics, chemistry, and biology). The elements above are often taught in [[education|the educational system]] as "the scientific method".&lt;ref&gt;In the [[Inquiry-based learning|inquiry-based education]] paradigm, the stage of "characterization, observation, definition, ..." is more briefly summed up under the rubric of a Question&lt;/ref&gt;

The scientific method is not a single recipe: it requires intelligence, imagination, and creativity.&lt;ref&gt;"To raise new questions, new possibilities, to regard old problems from a new angle, requires creative imagination and marks real advance in science." – {{harvnb|Einstein|Infeld|1938|p=92}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In this sense, it is not a mindless set of standards and procedures to follow,
but is rather an [[#Evaluation and improvement|ongoing cycle]], constantly developing more useful, accurate and comprehensive models and methods. For example, when Einstein developed the Special and General Theories of Relativity, he did not in any way refute or discount Newton's ''Principia''. On the contrary, if the astronomically large, the vanishingly small, and the extremely fast are removed from Einstein's theories – all phenomena Newton could not have observed – Newton's equations are what remain. Einstein's theories are expansions and refinements of Newton's theories and, thus, increase confidence in Newton's work.

A linearized, pragmatic scheme of the four points above is sometimes offered as a guideline for proceeding:&lt;ref&gt;Crawford S, Stucki L (1990), "Peer review and the changing research record", "J Am Soc Info Science", vol. 41, pp. 223–28&lt;/ref&gt;

# Define a question
# Gather information and resources (observe)
# Form an explanatory hypothesis
# Test the hypothesis by performing an experiment and collecting data in a [[Reproducibility|reproducible]] manner
# Analyze the data
# Interpret the data and draw conclusions that serve as a starting point for new hypothesis
# Publish results
# Retest (frequently done by other scientists)

The iterative cycle inherent in this step-by-step method goes from point 3 to 6 back to 3 again.

While this schema outlines a typical hypothesis/testing method,&lt;ref&gt;''See, e.g.'', {{harvnb|Gauch|2003}}, esp. chapters 5–8&lt;/ref&gt; it should also be noted that a number of philosophers, historians, and sociologists of science, including [[Paul Feyerabend]], claim that such descriptions of scientific method have little relation to the ways that science is actually practiced.

===Characterizations===
The scientific method depends upon increasingly sophisticated characterizations of the subjects of investigation. (The ''subjects'' can also be called [[:Category:Lists of unsolved problems|''unsolved problems'']] or the ''unknowns''.) For example, [[Benjamin Franklin]] conjectured, correctly, that [[St. Elmo's fire]] was [[electrical]] in [[nature]], but it has taken a long series of experiments and theoretical changes to establish this. While seeking the pertinent properties of the subjects, careful thought may also [[logical consequence|entail]] some definitions and observations; the [[observations]] often demand careful [[measurements]] and/or counting.

The systematic, careful collection of measurements or counts of relevant quantities is often the critical difference between [[Pseudoscience|pseudo-sciences]], such as alchemy, and science, such as chemistry or biology. Scientific measurements are usually tabulated, graphed, or mapped, and statistical manipulations, such as [[correlation]] and [[regression analysis|regression]], performed on them. The measurements might be made in a controlled setting, such as a laboratory, or made on more or less inaccessible or unmanipulatable objects such as stars or human populations. The measurements often require specialized [[scientific instrument]]s such as [[thermometer]]s, [[Spectrometer|spectroscopes]], [[particle accelerator]]s, or [[voltmeter]]s, and the progress of a scientific field is usually intimately tied to their invention and improvement.

Measurements in scientific work are also usually accompanied by estimates of their [[uncertainty]]. The uncertainty is often estimated by making repeated measurements of the desired quantity. Uncertainties may also be calculated by consideration of the uncertainties of the individual underlying quantities used. Counts of things, such as the number of people in a nation at a particular time, may also have an uncertainty due to data collection limitations. Or counts may represent a sample of desired quantities, with an uncertainty that depends upon the sampling method used and the number of samples taken.

====Definition====
Measurements demand the use of ''[[operational definition]]s'' of relevant quantities. That is, a scientific quantity is described or defined by how it is measured, as opposed to some more vague, inexact or "idealized" definition. For example, [[electric current]], measured in amperes, may be operationally defined in terms of the mass of silver deposited in a certain time on an electrode in an electrochemical device that is described in some detail. The operational definition of a thing often relies on comparisons with standards: the operational definition of "mass" ultimately relies on the use of an artifact, such as a particular kilogram of platinum-iridium kept in a laboratory in France.

The scientific definition of a term sometimes differs substantially from its [[natural language]] usage. For example, [[mass]] and [[weight]] overlap in meaning in common discourse, but have distinct meanings in [[mechanics]]. Scientific quantities are often characterized by their [[units of measurement|units of measure]] which can later be described in terms of conventional physical units when communicating the work.

New theories are sometimes developed after realizing certain terms have not previously been sufficiently clearly defined. For example, [[Albert Einstein]]'s first paper on [[Special relativity|relativity]] begins by defining [[Relativity of simultaneity|simultaneity]] and the means for determining [[length]]. These ideas were skipped over by [[Isaac Newton]] with, "I do not define [[time in physics#Galileo: the flow of time|time]], space, place and [[motion (physics)|motion]], as being well known to all." Einstein's paper then demonstrates that they (viz., absolute time and length independent of motion) were approximations. [[Francis Crick]] cautions us that when characterizing a subject, however, it can be premature to define something when it remains ill-understood.&lt;ref&gt;Crick, Francis (1994), ''The Astonishing Hypothesis'' {{ISBN|0684194317}} p. 20
&lt;/ref&gt; In Crick's study of [[consciousness]], he actually found it easier to study [[awareness]] in the [[visual system]], rather than to study [[free will]], for example. His cautionary example was the gene; the gene was much more poorly understood before Watson and Crick's pioneering discovery of the structure of DNA; it would have been counterproductive to spend much time on the definition of the gene, before them.

====DNA-characterizations====
&lt;span style="vertical-align:-120%"&gt;[[File:DNA icon (25x25).png|left|link=|alt=]]&lt;/span&gt; The [[DNA#History of DNA research|history]] of the discovery of the structure of DNA is a classic example of [[#Elements of the scientific method|the elements of the scientific method]]: in 1950 it was known that [[genetic inheritance]] had a mathematical description, starting with the studies of [[Gregor Mendel]], and that DNA contained genetic information (Oswald Avery's ''transforming principle'').&lt;ref name="harvnb|McCarty1985"/&gt; But the mechanism of storing genetic information (i.e., genes) in DNA was unclear. Researchers in [[William Lawrence Bragg|Bragg's]] laboratory at [[University of Cambridge|Cambridge University]] made [[X-ray]] [[diffraction]] pictures of various [[molecule]]s, starting with [[crystal]]s of [[salt]], and proceeding to more complicated substances. Using clues painstakingly assembled over decades, beginning with its chemical composition, it was determined that it should be possible to characterize the physical structure of DNA, and the X-ray images would be the vehicle.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|McElheny|2004}} p. 34&lt;/ref&gt; [[Scientific method#DNA-hypotheses|..''2. DNA-hypotheses'']]

====Another example: precession of Mercury====
[[File:Perihelio.svg|thumb|right|[[Apsidal precession|Precession]] of the [[Perihelion and aphelion|perihelion]] (exaggerated)]]

The characterization element can require extended and extensive study, even centuries. It took thousands of years of measurements, from the [[Chaldea]]n, [[India]]n, [[History of Iran|Persian]], [[Greece|Greek]], [[Arabs|Arabic]] and [[Ethnic groups in Europe|European]] astronomers, to fully record the motion of planet [[Earth]]. Newton was able to include those measurements into consequences of his [[Newton's laws of motion|laws of motion]]. But the [[Perihelion and aphelion|perihelion]] of the planet [[Mercury (planet)|Mercury]]'s [[orbit]] exhibits a precession that cannot be fully explained by Newton's laws of motion (see diagram to the right), as Leverrier pointed out in 1859. The observed difference for Mercury's [[Apsidal precession|precession]] between Newtonian theory and observation was one of the things that occurred to [[Albert Einstein]] as a possible early test of his theory of [[General relativity]]. His relativistic calculations matched observation much more closely than did Newtonian theory. The difference is approximately 43 arc-seconds per century.

===Hypothesis development===
{{Main article|Hypothesis formation}}

A [[hypothesis]] is a suggested explanation of a phenomenon, or alternately a reasoned proposal suggesting a possible correlation between or among a set of phenomena.

Normally hypotheses have the form of a [[mathematical model]]. Sometimes, but not always, they can also be formulated as [[existential quantification|existential statements]], stating that some particular instance of the phenomenon being studied has some characteristic and causal explanations, which have the general form of [[universal quantification|universal statements]], stating that every instance of the phenomenon has a particular characteristic.

Scientists are free to use whatever resources they have – their own creativity, ideas from other fields, [[inductive reasoning]], [[Bayesian inference]], and so on – to imagine possible explanations for a phenomenon under study. Albert Einstein once observed that "there is no logical bridge between phenomena and their theoretical principles."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Einstein |first1=Albert |title=The World as I See It |date=1949 |publisher=Philosophical Library |location=New York |pages=24–28}}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Charles Sanders Peirce]], borrowing a page from [[Aristotle]] (''[[Prior Analytics]]'', [[Inquiry#Abduction|2.25]]) described the incipient stages of [[inquiry]], instigated by the "irritation of doubt" to venture a plausible guess, as ''[[abductive reasoning]]''. The history of science is filled with stories of scientists claiming a "flash of inspiration", or a hunch, which then motivated them to look for evidence to support or refute their idea. [[Michael Polanyi]] made such creativity the centerpiece of his discussion of methodology.

[[William Glen (geologist and historian)|William Glen]] observes that&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Glen|1994|pp=37–38}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{blockquote|the success of a hypothesis, or its service to science, lies not simply in its perceived "truth", or power to displace, subsume or reduce a predecessor idea, but perhaps more in its ability to stimulate the research that will illuminate ... bald suppositions and areas of vagueness.}}

In general scientists tend to look for theories that are "[[Elegance|elegant]]" or "[[beauty|beautiful]]". In contrast to the usual English use of these terms, they here refer to a theory in accordance with the known facts, which is nevertheless relatively simple and easy to handle. [[Occam's Razor]] serves as a rule of thumb for choosing the most desirable amongst a group of equally explanatory hypotheses.

To minimize the [[confirmation bias]] which results from entertaining a single hypothesis, [[strong inference]] emphasizes the need for entertaining multiple alternative hypotheses.&lt;ref name=Platt&gt;[[John R. Platt]] (16 October 1964) [http://science.sciencemag.org/content/146/3642/347 Strong Inference] ''Science'' vol '''146''' (3642) p. 347 {{doi|10.1126/science.146.3642.347}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====DNA-hypotheses====
&lt;span style="vertical-align:-120%"&gt;[[File:DNA icon (25x25).png|left|link=|alt=]]&lt;/span&gt; [[Linus Pauling]] proposed that DNA might be a [[triple helix]].&lt;ref&gt;
"The structure that we propose is a three-chain structure, each chain being a helix" – Linus Pauling, as quoted on p. 157 by Horace Freeland Judson (1979), ''The Eighth Day of Creation'' {{ISBN|0671225405}}&lt;/ref&gt; This hypothesis was also considered by [[Francis Crick]] and [[James D. Watson]] but discarded. When Watson and Crick learned of Pauling's hypothesis, they understood from existing data that Pauling was wrong&lt;ref&gt;
{{harvnb|McElheny|2004|pp=49–50}}: January 28, 1953 – Watson read Pauling's pre-print, and realized that in Pauling's model, DNA's phosphate groups had to be un-ionized. But DNA is an acid, which contradicts Pauling's model.
&lt;/ref&gt; and that Pauling would soon admit his difficulties with that structure. So, the race was on to figure out the correct structure (except that Pauling did not realize at the time that he was in a race) ''[[#DNA-predictions|..3. DNA-predictions]]''

===Predictions from the hypothesis===
{{Main article|Prediction in science}}

Any useful hypothesis will enable [[prediction]]s, by [[reasoning]] including [[deductive reasoning]]. It might predict the outcome of an experiment in a laboratory setting or the observation of a phenomenon in nature. The prediction can also be statistical and deal only with probabilities.

It is essential that the outcome of testing such a prediction be currently unknown. Only in this case does a successful outcome increase the probability that the hypothesis is true. If the outcome is already known, it is called a consequence and should have already been considered while [[Scientific method#Hypothesis development|formulating the hypothesis]].

If the predictions are not accessible by observation or experience, the hypothesis is not yet testable and so will remain to that extent unscientific in a strict sense. A new technology or theory might make the necessary experiments feasible. For example, while a hypothesis on the existence of other intelligent species may be convincing with scientifically based speculation, there is no known experiment that can test this hypothesis. Therefore, science itself can have little to say about the possibility. In future, a new technique may allow for an experimental test and the speculation would then become part of accepted science.

====DNA-predictions====
&lt;span style="vertical-align:-120%"&gt;[[File:DNA icon (25x25).png|left|link=|alt=]]&lt;/span&gt; [[James D. Watson]], [[Francis Crick]], and others hypothesized that DNA had a helical structure. This implied that DNA's X-ray diffraction pattern would be 'x shaped'.&lt;ref name="Crick pp. 137–138"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;
June 1952. as noted in {{harvnb|McElheny|2004|p=43}}: Watson had succeeded in getting X-ray pictures of TMV showing a diffraction pattern consistent with the transform of a helix.
&lt;/ref&gt; This prediction followed from the work of Cochran, Crick and Vand&lt;ref name="HelixTransform"/&gt; (and independently by Stokes). The Cochran-Crick-Vand-Stokes theorem provided a mathematical explanation for the empirical observation that diffraction from helical structures produces x shaped patterns.

In their first paper, Watson and Crick also noted that the [[double helix]] structure they proposed provided a simple mechanism for [[DNA replication]], writing, "It has not escaped our notice that the specific pairing we have postulated immediately suggests a possible copying mechanism for the genetic material".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|McElheny|2004}} p. 68: ''Nature'' April 25, 1953.&lt;/ref&gt; [[#DNA-experiments|'' ..4. DNA-experiments'']]

====Another example: general relativity====
[[File:Gravitational lens-full.jpg|right|thumb|upright=0.9|[[gravitational lensing|Einstein's prediction (1907): Light bends in a gravitational field]]]]

Einstein's theory of [[General Relativity]] makes several specific predictions about the observable structure of [[space-time]], such as that [[light]] bends in a [[gravitational field]], and that the amount of bending depends in a precise way on the strength of that gravitational field. [[Arthur Eddington]]'s observations made during a 1919 [[solar eclipse]] supported General Relativity rather than Newtonian [[gravitation]].&lt;ref&gt;In March 1917, the [[Royal Astronomical Society]] announced that on May 29, 1919, the occasion of a [[total eclipse]] of the sun would afford favorable conditions for testing Einstein's [[General theory of relativity]]. One expedition, to [[Sobral, Ceará]], [[Brazil]], and Eddington's expedition to the island of [[Principe]] yielded a set of photographs, which, when compared to photographs taken at [[Sobral, Ceará|Sobral]] and at [[Greenwich Observatory]] showed that the deviation of light was measured to be 1.69 [[arc-second]]s, as compared to Einstein's desk prediction of 1.75 [[arc-second]]s. – Antonina Vallentin (1954), ''Einstein'', as quoted by Samuel Rapport and Helen Wright (1965), ''Physics'', New York: Washington Square Press, pp. 294–95.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Experiments===
{{Main article|Experiment}}

Once predictions are made, they can be sought by experiments. If the test results contradict the predictions, the hypotheses which entailed them are called into question and become less tenable. Sometimes the experiments are conducted incorrectly or are not very well designed, when compared to a [[crucial experiment]]. If the experimental results confirm the predictions, then the hypotheses are considered more likely to be correct, but might still be wrong and continue to be subject to [[#Evaluation and improvement|further testing.]] The [[experimental control]] is a technique for dealing with observational error. This technique uses the contrast between multiple samples (or observations) under differing conditions to see what varies or what remains the same. We vary the conditions for each measurement, to help isolate what has changed. [[Mill's canons]] can then help us figure out what the important factor is.&lt;ref&gt;[[John Stuart Mill|Mill, John Stuart]], "A System of Logic", University Press of the Pacific, Honolulu, 2002, {{ISBN|1410202526}}.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Factor analysis]] is one technique for discovering the important factor in an effect.

Depending on the predictions, the experiments can have different shapes. It could be a classical experiment in a laboratory setting, a [[double-blind]] study or an archaeological [[excavation (archaeology)|excavation]]. Even taking a plane from [[New York City|New York]] to [[Paris]] is an experiment which tests the [[aerodynamics|aerodynamical]] hypotheses used for constructing the plane.

Scientists assume an attitude of openness and accountability on the part of those conducting an experiment. Detailed record keeping is essential, to aid in recording and reporting on the experimental results, and supports the effectiveness and integrity of the procedure. They will also assist in reproducing the experimental results, likely by others. Traces of this approach can be seen in the work of [[Hipparchus]] (190–120 BCE), when determining a value for the precession of the Earth, while [[Scientific control|controlled experiments]] can be seen in the works of [[Jābir ibn Hayyān]] (721–815 CE), [[Muhammad ibn Jābir al-Harrānī al-Battānī|al-Battani]] (853–929) and Alhazen (965–1039).&lt;ref&gt;[[Muhammad ibn Jābir al-Harrānī al-Battānī|al-Battani]], ''De Motu Stellarum'' [[Latin translations of the 12th century|translation from Arabic to Latin in 1116]], as cited by "Battani, al-" (c. 858–929) ''Encyclopædia Britannica'', 15th. ed. Al-Battani is known for his accurate observations at al-Raqqah in Syria, beginning in 877. His work includes measurement of the annual precession of the equinoxes.&lt;/ref&gt;

====DNA-experiments====
&lt;span style="vertical-align:-120%"&gt;[[File:DNA icon (25x25).png|left|link=|alt=]]&lt;/span&gt; Watson and Crick showed an initial (and incorrect) proposal for the structure of DNA to a team from Kings College – [[Rosalind Franklin]], [[Maurice Wilkins]], and [[Raymond Gosling]]. Franklin immediately spotted the flaws which concerned the water content. Later Watson saw Franklin's detailed [[Photo 51|X-ray diffraction images]] which showed an [https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/photo51/ X-shape] and was able to confirm the structure was helical.&lt;ref name="TeaTime"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Watson 1968 167"/&gt; This rekindled Watson and Crick's model building and led to the correct structure. [[Scientific method#DNA-characterizations|''..1. DNA-characterizations'']]

===Evaluation and improvement===
The scientific method is iterative. At any stage it is possible to refine its [[accuracy and precision]], so that some consideration will lead the scientist to repeat an earlier part of the process. Failure to develop an interesting hypothesis may lead a scientist to re-define the subject under consideration. Failure of a hypothesis to produce interesting and testable predictions may lead to reconsideration of the hypothesis or of the definition of the subject. Failure of an experiment to produce interesting results may lead a scientist to reconsider the experimental method, the hypothesis, or the definition of the subject.

Other scientists may start their own research and enter the process at any stage. They might adopt the characterization and formulate their own hypothesis, or they might adopt the hypothesis and deduce their own predictions. Often the experiment is not done by the person who made the prediction, and the characterization is based on experiments done by someone else. Published results of experiments can also serve as a hypothesis predicting their own reproducibility.

====DNA-iterations====
&lt;span style="vertical-align:-120%"&gt;[[File:DNA icon (25x25).png|left|link=|alt=]]&lt;/span&gt; After considerable fruitless experimentation, being discouraged by their superior from continuing, and numerous false starts,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|McElheny|2004}} p. 53: The weekend (January 31 – February 1) after seeing photo 51, Watson informed Bragg of the X-ray diffraction image of DNA in B form. Bragg gave them permission to restart their research on DNA (that is, model building).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|McElheny|2004}} p. 54: On Sunday February 8, 1953, Maurice Wilkes gave Watson and Crick permission to work on models, as Wilkes would not be building models until Franklin left DNA research.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|McElheny|2004}} p. 56: [[Jerry Donohue]], on sabbatical from Pauling's lab and visiting Cambridge, advises Watson that textbook form of the base pairs was incorrect for DNA base pairs; rather, the keto form of the base pairs should be used instead. This form allowed the bases' hydrogen bonds to pair 'unlike' with 'unlike', rather than to pair 'like' with 'like', as Watson was inclined to model, on the basis of the textbook statements. On February 27, 1953, Watson was convinced enough to make cardboard models of the nucleotides in their keto form.&lt;/ref&gt; Watson and Crick were able to infer the essential structure of [[DNA]] by concrete [[model (abstract)|modeling]] [[DNA#History of DNA research|of the physical shapes]] of the [[nucleotide]]s which comprise it.&lt;ref name="SameShape" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;
"Suddenly I became aware that an [[adenine]]-[[thymine]] pair held together by two [[hydrogen bond]]s was identical in shape to a [[guanine]]-[[cytosine]] pair held together by at least two hydrogen bonds. ..." – {{harvnb|Watson|1968|pp=194–97}}.
* {{harvnb|McElheny|2004}} p. 57 Saturday, February 28, 1953, Watson tried 'like with like' and admitted these base pairs didn't have hydrogen bonds that line up. But after trying 'unlike with unlike', and getting [[Jerry Donohue]]'s approval, the base pairs turned out to be identical in shape (as Watson stated above in his 1968 ''Double Helix'' memoir quoted above). Watson now felt confident enough to inform Crick. (Of course, 'unlike with unlike' increases the number of possible [[codon]]s, if this scheme were a [[genetic code]].)
&lt;/ref&gt; They were guided by the bond lengths which had been deduced by [[Linus Pauling]] and by [[Rosalind Franklin]]'s X-ray diffraction images. [[Scientific method#DNA example|..''DNA Example'']]

===Confirmation===
Science is a social enterprise, and scientific work tends to be accepted by the scientific community when it has been confirmed. Crucially, experimental and theoretical results must be reproduced by others within the scientific community. Researchers have given their lives for this vision; [[Georg Wilhelm Richmann]] was killed by [[ball lightning]] (1753) when attempting to replicate the 1752 kite-flying experiment of [[Benjamin Franklin]].&lt;ref&gt;
See, e.g., ''Physics Today'', '''59'''(1), p. 42. [http://ptonline.aip.org/journals/doc/PHTOAD-ft/vol_59/iss_1/42_1.shtml?bypassSSO=1 Richmann electrocuted in St. Petersburg (1753)]
&lt;/ref&gt;

To protect against bad science and fraudulent data, government research-granting agencies such as the [[National Science Foundation]], and science journals, including ''Nature'' and ''Science'', have a policy that researchers must archive their data and methods so that other researchers can test the data and methods and build on the research that has gone before. [[Scientific data archiving]] can be done at a number of national archives in the U.S. or in the [[World Data Center]].

==Models of scientific inquiry==
{{Main article|Models of scientific inquiry}}

===Classical model===
The classical model of scientific inquiry derives from Aristotle,&lt;ref&gt;
[[Aristotle]], "[[Prior Analytics]]", [[Hugh Tredennick]] (trans.), pp. 181–531 in ''Aristotle, Volume&amp;nbsp;1'', [[Loeb Classical Library]], William Heinemann, London, 1938.
&lt;/ref&gt; who distinguished the forms of approximate and exact reasoning, set out the threefold scheme of [[abductive reasoning|abductive]], [[deductive reasoning|deductive]], and [[inductive reasoning|inductive]] [[inference]], and also treated the compound forms such as reasoning by [[analogy]].

===Hypothetico-deductive model===
The [[hypothetico-deductive model]] or method is a proposed description of scientific method. Here, predictions from the hypothesis are central: if you assume the hypothesis to be true, what consequences follow?

If subsequent empirical investigation does not demonstrate that these consequences or predictions correspond to the observable world, the hypothesis can be concluded to be false.

===Pragmatic model===
{{See also|Pragmatic theory of truth}}
In 1877,&lt;ref name=Fixation&gt;{{cite wikisource |last=Peirce |first=Charles Sanders |year=1877 |title=The Fixation of Belief |journal=Popular Science Monthly |volume=12 |pages=1–15 |wslink=The Fixation of Belief}}.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Charles Sanders Peirce]] (1839–1914) characterized inquiry in general not as the pursuit of truth ''per se'' but as the struggle to move from irritating, inhibitory doubts born of surprises, disagreements, and the like, and to reach a secure belief, belief being that on which one is prepared to act. He framed scientific inquiry as part of a broader spectrum and as spurred, like inquiry generally, by actual doubt, not mere verbal or [[hyperbolic doubt]], which he held to be fruitless.&lt;ref name=Doubt&gt;"What one does not in the least doubt one should not pretend to doubt; but a man should train himself to doubt," said Peirce in a brief intellectual autobiography; see Ketner, Kenneth Laine (2009) "Charles Sanders Peirce: Interdisciplinary Scientist" in ''The Logic of Interdisciplinarity''). Peirce held that actual, genuine doubt originates externally, usually in surprise, but also that it is to be sought and cultivated, "provided only that it be the weighty and noble metal itself, and no counterfeit nor paper substitute"; in "Issues of Pragmaticism", ''The Monist'', v. XV, n. 4, pp. 481–99, see [https://archive.org/stream/monistquart15hegeuoft#page/484/mode/1up p. 484], and [https://archive.org/stream/monistquart15hegeuoft#page/491/mode/1up p. 491]. (Reprinted in ''Collected Papers'' v. 5, paragraphs 438–63, see 443 and 451).&lt;/ref&gt; He outlined four methods of settling opinion, ordered from least to most successful:
# The method of tenacity (policy of sticking to initial belief) – which brings comforts and decisiveness but leads to trying to ignore contrary information and others' views as if truth were intrinsically private, not public. It goes against the social impulse and easily falters since one may well notice when another's opinion is as good as one's own initial opinion. Its successes can shine but tend to be transitory.&lt;ref&gt;But see [[Scientific method and religion]].&lt;/ref&gt;
# The method of authority – which overcomes disagreements but sometimes brutally. Its successes can be majestic and long-lived, but it cannot operate thoroughly enough to suppress doubts indefinitely, especially when people learn of other societies present and past.
# The method of the ''a priori'' – which promotes conformity less brutally but fosters opinions as something like tastes, arising in conversation and comparisons of perspectives in terms of "what is agreeable to reason." Thereby it depends on fashion in [[paradigm]]s and goes in circles over time. It is more intellectual and respectable but, like the first two methods, sustains accidental and capricious beliefs, destining some minds to doubt it.
# The scientific method – the method wherein inquiry regards itself as [[Fallibilism|fallible]] and purposely tests itself and criticizes, corrects, and improves itself.

Peirce held that slow, stumbling [[wikt:ratiocination|ratiocination]] can be dangerously inferior to instinct and traditional sentiment in practical matters, and that the scientific method is best suited to theoretical research,&lt;ref&gt;Peirce (1898), "Philosophy and the Conduct of Life", Lecture 1 of the Cambridge (MA) Conferences Lectures, published in ''Collected Papers'' v. 1, paragraphs 616–48 in part and in ''Reasoning and the Logic of Things'', Ketner (ed., intro.) and Putnam (intro., comm.), pp. 105–22, reprinted in ''Essential Peirce'' v. 2, pp. 27–41.&lt;/ref&gt; which in turn should not be trammeled by the other methods and practical ends; reason's "first rule" is that, in order to learn, one must desire to learn and, as a corollary, must not block the way of inquiry.&lt;ref name=F.R.L.&gt;" ... in order to learn, one must desire to learn ..." – Peirce (1899), "F.R.L." [First Rule of Logic], ''Collected Papers'' v. 1, paragraphs 135–40, {{cite web|url=http://www.princeton.edu/~batke/peirce/frl_99.htm |title=Eprint |accessdate=2012-01-06 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120106071421/http://www.princeton.edu/~batke/peirce/frl_99.htm |archivedate=January 6, 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The scientific method excels the others by being deliberately designed to arrive – eventually – at the most secure beliefs, upon which the most successful practices can be based. Starting from the idea that people seek not truth ''per se'' but instead to subdue irritating, inhibitory doubt, Peirce showed how, through the struggle, some can come to submit to truth for the sake of belief's integrity, seek as truth the guidance of potential practice correctly to its given goal, and wed themselves to the scientific method.&lt;ref name=Fixation/&gt;&lt;ref name=Vital&gt;Peirce, C.S., ''Collected Papers'' v. 5, in paragraph 582, from 1898:
{{quote|... [rational] inquiry of every type, fully carried out, has the vital power of self-correction and of growth. This is a property so deeply saturating its inmost nature that it may truly be said that there is but one thing needful for learning the truth, and that is a hearty and active desire to learn what is true.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For Peirce, rational inquiry implies presuppositions about truth and the real; to reason is to presuppose (and at least to hope), as a principle of the reasoner's self-regulation, that the real is discoverable and independent of our vagaries of opinion. In that vein he defined truth as the correspondence of a sign (in particular, a proposition) to its object and, pragmatically, not as actual consensus of some definite, finite community (such that to inquire would be to poll the experts), but instead as that final opinion which all investigators ''would'' reach sooner or later but still inevitably, if they were to push investigation far enough, even when they start from different points.&lt;ref name=How&gt;{{cite wikisource |last=Peirce |first=Charles Sanders |year=1877 |title=How to Make Our Ideas Clear |journal=Popular Science Monthly |volume=12 |pages=286–302 wslink==How to Make Our Ideas Clear}}&lt;/ref&gt; In tandem he defined the real as a true sign's object (be that object a possibility or quality, or an actuality or brute fact, or a necessity or norm or law), which is what it is independently of any finite community's opinion and, pragmatically, depends only on the final opinion destined in a sufficient investigation. That is a destination as far, or near, as the truth itself to you or me or the given finite community. Thus, his theory of inquiry boils down to "Do the science." Those conceptions of truth and the real involve the idea of a community both without definite limits (and thus potentially self-correcting as far as needed) and capable of definite increase of knowledge.&lt;ref name=4Incapacities&gt;Peirce (1868), "Some Consequences of Four Incapacities", ''Journal of Speculative Philosophy'' v. 2, n. 3, pp. 140–57. Reprinted ''Collected Papers'' v. 5, paragraphs 264–317, ''The Essential Peirce'' v. 1, pp. 28–55, and elsewhere.

The very idea of probability and of reasoning rests on the assumption that this number is indefinitely great. .... ...logicality inexorably requires that our interests shall not be limited. .... Logic is rooted in the social principle."&lt;/ref&gt;

Paying special attention to the generation of explanations, Peirce outlined the scientific method as a coordination of three kinds of inference in a purposeful cycle aimed at settling doubts, as follows (in §III–IV in "A Neglected Argument"&lt;ref name=NA&gt;{{cite wikisource |last=Peirce |first=Charles Sanders|date=1908 |title=A Neglected Argument for the Reality of God |journal=Hibbert Journal |volume=7 |pages=90–112 |wslink=A Neglected Argument for the Reality of God}} with added notes.

From abduction, Peirce distinguishes induction as inferring, on the basis of tests, the proportion of truth in the hypothesis. Every inquiry, whether into ideas, brute facts, or norms and laws, arises from surprising observations in one or more of those realms (and for example at any stage of an inquiry already underway). All explanatory content of theories comes from abduction, which guesses a new or outside idea so as to account in a simple, economical way for a surprising or complicative phenomenon. Oftenest, even a well-prepared mind guesses wrong. But the modicum of success of our guesses far exceeds that of sheer luck and seems born of attunement to nature by instincts developed or inherent, especially insofar as best guesses are optimally plausible and simple in the sense, said Peirce, of the "facile and natural", as by [[Galileo]]'s natural light of reason and as distinct from "logical simplicity". Abduction is the most fertile but least secure mode of inference. Its general rationale is inductive: it succeeds often enough and, without it, there is no hope of sufficiently expediting inquiry (often multi-generational) toward new truths.&lt;ref name=PAP&gt;Peirce (c. 1906), "PAP (Prolegomena for an Apology to Pragmatism)" (Manuscript 293, not the like-named article), ''The New Elements of Mathematics'' (NEM) 4:319–20, see first quote under "[http://www.helsinki.fi/science/commens/terms/abduction.html Abduction]" at ''Commens Dictionary of Peirce's Terms''.&lt;/ref&gt; Coordinative method leads from abducing a plausible hypothesis to judging it for its [[testability]]&lt;ref name=SuitableTest&gt;Peirce, Carnegie application (L75, 1902), ''New Elements of Mathematics'' v. 4, pp. 37–38: {{quote|For it is not sufficient that a hypothesis should be a justifiable one. Any hypothesis which explains the facts is justified critically. But among justifiable hypotheses we have to select that one which is suitable for being tested by experiment.}}&lt;/ref&gt; and for how its trial would economize inquiry itself.&lt;ref name=econ&gt;Peirce (1902), Carnegie application, see MS L75.329330, from [http://www.cspeirce.com/menu/library/bycsp/l75/ver1/l75v1-08.htm#m27 Draft D] of Memoir 27:
{{quote|Consequently, to discover is simply to expedite an event that would occur sooner or later, if we had not troubled ourselves to make the discovery. Consequently, the art of discovery is purely a question of economics. The economics of research is, so far as logic is concerned, the leading doctrine with reference to the art of discovery. Consequently, the conduct of abduction, which is chiefly a question of heuretic and is the first question of heuretic, is to be governed by economical considerations.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Peirce calls [[Pragmaticism|his pragmatism]] "the logic of abduction".&lt;ref name=LogAbduc&gt;Peirce (1903), "Pragmatism – The Logic of Abduction", ''Collected Papers'' v. 5, paragraphs 195–205, especially 196. [http://www.textlog.de/7663.html Eprint].&lt;/ref&gt; His [[pragmatic maxim]] is: "Consider what effects that might conceivably have practical bearings you conceive the objects of your conception to have. Then, your conception of those effects is the whole of your conception of the object".&lt;ref name=How /&gt; His pragmatism is a method of reducing conceptual confusions fruitfully by equating the meaning of any conception with the conceivable practical implications of its object's conceived effects – a method of experimentational mental reflection hospitable to forming hypotheses and conducive to testing them. It favors efficiency. The hypothesis, being insecure, needs to have practical implications leading at least to mental tests and, in science, lending themselves to scientific tests. A simple but unlikely guess, if uncostly to test for falsity, may belong first in line for testing. A guess is intrinsically worth testing if it has instinctive plausibility or reasoned objective probability, while [[Subjective probability|subjective likelihood]], though reasoned, can be misleadingly seductive. Guesses can be chosen for trial strategically, for their caution (for which Peirce gave as example the game of [[Twenty Questions]]), breadth, and incomplexity.&lt;ref name=20Qs&gt;Peirce, "On the Logic of Drawing Ancient History from Documents", ''Essential Peirce'' v. 2, see pp. 107–09. On Twenty Questions, p. 109: {{quote|Thus, twenty skillful hypotheses will ascertain what 200,000 stupid ones might fail to do.}}&lt;/ref&gt; One can hope to discover only that which time would reveal through a learner's sufficient experience anyway, so the point is to expedite it; the economy of research is what demands the leap, so to speak, of abduction and governs its art.&lt;ref name=econ /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;''[[Deductive reasoning|Deduction]]''. Two stages:
&lt;ol type="i"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Explication. Unclearly premissed, but deductive, analysis of the hypothesis in order to render its parts as clear as possible.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Demonstration: Deductive Argumentation, [[Euclid]]ean in procedure. Explicit deduction of hypothesis's consequences as predictions, for induction to test, about evidence to be found. [[Corollary|Corollarial]] or, if needed, theorematic.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;''[[Inductive reasoning|Induction]]''. The long-run validity of the rule of induction is deducible from the principle (presuppositional to reasoning in general&lt;ref name=How /&gt;) that the real is only the object of the final opinion to which adequate investigation would lead;&lt;ref name=ProbInduc&gt;Peirce (1878), "The Probability of Induction", ''Popular Science Monthly'', v. 12, pp. 705–18, see [https://books.google.com/?id=ZKMVAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA718 718] ''Google Books''; [https://archive.org/stream/popscimonthly12yoummiss#page/728/mode/1up 718] via ''Internet Archive''. Reprinted often, including (''Collected Papers'' v. 2, paragraphs 669–93), (''The Essential Peirce'' v. 1, pp. 155–69).&lt;/ref&gt; anything to which no such process would ever lead would not be real. Induction involving ongoing tests or observations follows a method which, sufficiently persisted in, will diminish its error below any predesignate degree. Three stages:
&lt;ol type="i"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Classification. Unclearly premissed, but inductive, classing of objects of experience under general ideas.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Probation: direct inductive argumentation. Crude (the enumeration of instances) or gradual (new estimate of proportion of truth in the hypothesis after each test). Gradual induction is qualitative or quantitative; if qualitative, then dependent on [[weighting]]s of qualities or characters;&lt;ref&gt;Peirce (1905 draft "G" of "A Neglected Argument"), "Crude, Quantitative, and Qualitative Induction", ''Collected Papers'' v. 2, paragraphs 755–60, see 759. Find under "[http://www.helsinki.fi/science/commens/terms/induction.html Induction]" at ''Commens Dictionary of Peirce's Terms''.&lt;/ref&gt; if quantitative, then dependent on measurements, [[Charles Sanders Peirce#Probability and statistics|or on statistics]], or on countings.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Sentential Induction. "...which, by inductive reasonings, appraises the different probations singly, then their combinations, then makes self-appraisal of these very appraisals themselves, and passes final judgment on the whole result".&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

==Science of complex systems==
Science applied to complex systems can involve elements such as [[transdisciplinarity]], [[systems theory]] and [[scientific modelling]]. The [[Santa Fe Institute]] studies such systems;&lt;ref name=Crutchfield&gt;{{cite web|url=http://csc.ucdavis.edu/~chaos/chaos/talks/CSTheorySFIRetreat.pdf|title=James  (2003) "Complex Systems Theory?"|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Murray Gell-Mann]] interconnects these topics with [[message passing]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://physicstoday.scitation.org/doi/10.1063/1.2808634 Review of ''The Quark and the Jaguar'', by Murray Gell-Mann (1994)]
* [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AGSXGMpA0pY Murray Gell-Mann, "What the ''Quark and Jaguar'' is about" – Youtube clip]&lt;/ref&gt;

In general, the scientific method may be difficult to apply stringently to diverse, interconnected systems and large data sets. In particular, practices used within [[Big data]], such as [[predictive analytics]], may be considered to be at odds with the scientific method.&lt;ref&gt;Anderson, Chris (2008) [http://www.uvm.edu/~pdodds/files/papers/others/2008/anderson2008a.pdf The End of Theory: The Data Deluge Makes the Scientiﬁc Method Obsolete]. Wired Magazine 16.07&lt;/ref&gt;

==Communication and community==
{{see also|Scientific community|Scholarly communication}}

Frequently the scientific method is employed not only by a single person, but also by several people cooperating directly or indirectly. Such cooperation can be regarded as an important element of a [[scientific community]]. Various standards of scientific methodology are used within such an environment.

===Peer review evaluation===
Scientific journals use a process of ''[[peer review]]'', in which scientists' manuscripts are submitted by editors of scientific journals to (usually one to three, and usually anonymous) fellow scientists familiar with the field for evaluation. In certain journals, the journal itself selects the referees; while in others (especially journals that are extremely specialized), the manuscript author might recommend referees. The referees may or may not recommend publication, or they might recommend publication with suggested modifications, or sometimes, publication in another journal. This standard is practiced to various degrees by different journals, and can have the effect of keeping the literature free of obvious errors and to generally improve the quality of the material, especially in the journals who use the standard most rigorously. The peer review process can have limitations when considering research outside the conventional scientific paradigm: problems of "[[groupthink]]" can interfere with open and fair deliberation of some new research.&lt;ref&gt;. Brown, C. (2005) Overcoming Barriers to Use of Promising Research Among Elite Middle East Policy Groups, Journal of Social Behaviour and Personality, Select Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Documentation and replication===
{{Main article|Reproducibility}}
Sometimes experimenters may make systematic errors during their experiments, veer from standard methods and practices ([[Pathological science]]) for various reasons, or, in rare cases, deliberately report false results. Occasionally because of this then, other scientists might attempt to repeat the experiments in order to duplicate the results.

====Archiving====
Researchers sometimes practice [[scientific data archiving]], such as in compliance with the policies of government funding agencies and scientific journals. In these cases, detailed records of their experimental procedures, raw data, statistical analyses and source code can be preserved in order to provide evidence of the methodology and practice of the procedure and assist in any potential future attempts to [[Reproducibility|reproduce the result]]. These procedural records may also assist in the conception of new experiments to test the hypothesis, and may prove useful to engineers who might examine the potential practical applications of a discovery.

====Data sharing====
When additional information is needed before a study can be reproduced, the author of the study might be asked to provide it. They might provide it, or if the author refuses to [[data sharing|share data]], appeals can be made to the journal editors who published the study or to the institution which funded the research.

====Limitations====
Since it is impossible for a scientist to record ''everything'' that took place in an experiment, facts selected for their apparent relevance are reported. This may lead, unavoidably, to problems later if some supposedly irrelevant feature is questioned. For example, [[Heinrich Hertz]] did not report the size of the room used to test Maxwell's equations, which later turned out to account for a small deviation in the results. The problem is that parts of the theory itself need to be assumed in order to select and report the experimental conditions. The observations are hence sometimes described as being 'theory-laden'.

===Dimensions of practice===
{{Further information|Rhetoric of science}}

The primary constraints on contemporary science are:
* Publication, i.e. [[Peer review]]
* Resources (mostly funding)
It has not always been like this: in the old days of the "[[gentleman scientist]]" funding (and to a lesser extent publication) were far weaker constraints.

Both of these constraints indirectly require scientific method – work that violates the constraints will be difficult to publish and difficult to get funded. Journals require submitted papers to conform to "good scientific practice" and to a degree this can be enforced by peer review. Originality, importance and interest are more important – see for example the [http://www.nature.com/nature/submit/get_published/index.html author guidelines] for [[Nature (journal)|''Nature'']].

Smaldino and McElreath 2016 have noted that our need to reward scientific understanding is being nullified by poor research design and poor data analysis, which is leading to false-positive findings.&lt;ref name=Smaldino2016&gt;{{Cite journal|title = The natural selection of bad science|journal = R.

==Philosophy and sociology of science==
{{See also|Philosophy of science|Sociology of science}}
===Analytical philosophy===
Philosophy of science looks at the underpinning logic of the scientific method, at what separates [[Demarcation problem|science from non-science]], and the [[Research ethics|ethic]] that is implicit in science. There are basic assumptions, derived from philosophy by at least one prominent scientist, that form the base of the scientific method – namely, that reality is objective and consistent, that humans have the capacity to perceive reality accurately, and that rational explanations exist for elements of the real world.&lt;ref&gt;Einstein, Albert (1936, 1956) One may say "the eternal mystery of the world is its comprehensibility." From the article "Physics and Reality" (1936), reprinted in ''Out of My Later Years'' (1956). 'It is one of the great realizations of Immanuel Kant that the setting up of a real external world would be senseless without this comprehensibility.'&lt;/ref&gt; These assumptions from [[naturalism (philosophy)|methodological naturalism]] form a basis on which science may be grounded. [[Logical positivism|Logical Positivist]], [[empiricism|empiricist]], [[falsifiability|falsificationist]], and other theories have criticized these assumptions and given alternative accounts of the logic of science, but each has also itself been criticized. More generally, the scientific method can be recognized as an idealization.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Thomas Kuhn]] examined the history of science in his ''[[The Structure of Scientific Revolutions]]'', and found that the actual method used by scientists differed dramatically from the then-espoused method. His observations of science practice are essentially sociological and do not speak to how science is or can be practiced in other times and other cultures.

[[Norwood Russell Hanson]], [[Imre Lakatos]] and [[Thomas Kuhn]] have done extensive work on the "theory laden" character of observation. Hanson (1958) first coined the term for the idea that all observation is dependent on [[Situated cognition|the conceptual framework of the observer]], using the concept of [[gestalt psychology|gestalt]] to show how preconceptions can affect both observation and description.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

Kuhn&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Kuhn|1962|p=113}}
{{ISBN|978-1443255448}}
&lt;/ref&gt; and Feyerabend&lt;ref&gt;Feyerabend, Paul K (1960) "Patterns of Discovery" The Philosophical Review (1960) vol. 69 (2) pp. 247–52&lt;/ref&gt; acknowledge the pioneering significance of his work.

Kuhn (1961) said the scientist generally has a theory in mind before designing and undertaking experiments so as to make empirical observations, and that the "route from theory to measurement can almost never be traveled backward". This implies that the way in which theory is tested is dictated by the nature of the theory itself, which led Kuhn (1961, p.&amp;nbsp;166) to argue that "once it has been adopted by a profession ... no theory is recognized to be testable by any quantitative tests that it has not already passed".&lt;ref&gt;[[Thomas Kuhn|Kuhn, Thomas S.]], "The Function of Measurement in Modern Physical Science", ''ISIS'' 52(2), 161–93, 1961.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Post-modernism and science wars===
[[Paul Feyerabend]] similarly examined the history of science, and was led to deny that science is genuinely a methodological process. In his book ''[[Against Method]]'' he argues that scientific progress is ''not'' the result of applying any particular method. In essence, he says that for any specific method or norm of science, one can find a historic episode where violating it has contributed to the progress of science. Thus, if believers in scientific method wish to express a single universally valid rule, Feyerabend jokingly suggests, it should be 'anything goes'.&lt;ref&gt;[[Paul Feyerabend|Feyerabend, Paul K.]], ''Against Method, Outline of an Anarchistic Theory of Knowledge'', 1st published, 1975. Reprinted, Verso, London, 1978.
&lt;/ref&gt; Criticisms such as his led to the [[strong programme]], a radical approach to the [[sociology of science]].

The [[postmodernism|postmodernist]] critiques of science have themselves been the subject of intense controversy. This ongoing debate, known as the [[science wars]], is the result of conflicting values and assumptions between the postmodernist and [[Scientific realism|realist]] camps. Whereas postmodernists assert that scientific knowledge is simply another discourse (note that this term has special meaning in this context) and not representative of any form of fundamental truth, [[Scientific realism|realists]] in the scientific community maintain that scientific knowledge does reveal real and fundamental truths about reality. Many books have been written by scientists which take on this problem and challenge the assertions of the postmodernists while defending science as a legitimate method of deriving truth.&lt;ref&gt;

===Anthropology===
In [[anthropology]], following the anthropological fieldworks in an academic scientific laboratory by [[Bruno Latour|Latour]] and [[Steve Woolgar|Woolgar]], [[Karin Knorr Cetina]] has conducted a comparative anthropological study of two scientific fields (namely [[Particle physics|high energy physics]] and [[molecular biology]]) to conclude that the epistemic practices and reasonings within both scientific communities are different enough to introduce the concept of "[[epistemic cultures]]", in contradiction with the idea that a so callled "scientific method" is unique and a unifying concept.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/39539508|title=Epistemic cultures : how the sciences make knowledge|last=(Karin)|first=Knorr-Cetina, K.|date=1999|publisher=Harvard University Press|isbn=0674258932|location=Cambridge, Mass.|oclc=39539508}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Role of chance in discovery===
{{Main article|Role of chance in scientific discoveries}}
Somewhere between 33% and 50% of all scientific discoveries are estimated to have been ''stumbled upon'', rather than sought out. This may explain why scientists so often express that they were lucky.&lt;ref name=DunbarLuck&gt;Dunbar, K., &amp; Fugelsang, J. (2005). Causal thinking in science: How scientists and students interpret the unexpected. In M.E. Gorman, R.D. Tweney, D. Gooding &amp; A. Kincannon (Eds.), Scientific and Technical Thinking (pp. 57–79). Mahwah, NJ: Lawrence Erlbaum Associates.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Louis Pasteur]] is credited with the famous saying that "Luck favours the prepared mind", but some psychologists have begun to study what it means to be 'prepared for luck' in the scientific context. Research is showing that scientists are taught various heuristics that tend to harness chance and the unexpected.'''&lt;ref name="DunbarLuck"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Oliver, J.E. 1991"&gt;Oliver, J.E. (1991) Ch2. of The incomplete guide to the art of discovery. New York: Columbia University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;''' This is what [[Nassim Nicholas Taleb]] calls "Anti-fragility"; while some systems of investigation are fragile in the face of [[human error]], human bias, and randomness, the scientific method is more than resistant or tough – it actually benefits from such randomness in many ways (it is anti-fragile). Taleb believes that the more anti-fragile the system, the more it will flourish in the real world.&lt;ref name=Anti-fragility&gt;[http://www.edge.org/q2011/q11_3.html Taleb contributes a brief description of anti-fragility]&lt;/ref&gt;

Psychologist Kevin Dunbar says the process of discovery often starts with researchers finding bugs in their experiments. These unexpected results lead researchers to try to fix what they ''think'' is an error in their method. Eventually, the researcher decides the error is too persistent and systematic to be a coincidence. The highly controlled, cautious and curious aspects of the scientific method are thus what make it well suited for identifying such persistent systematic errors. At this point, the researcher will begin to think of theoretical explanations for the error, often seeking the help of colleagues across different domains of expertise.&lt;ref name="DunbarLuck"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Oliver, J.E. 1991"/&gt;

==Relationship with mathematics==
Science is the process of gathering, comparing, and evaluating proposed models against [[observable]]s. A model can be a simulation, mathematical or chemical formula, or set of proposed steps. Science is like mathematics in that researchers in both disciplines try to distinguish what is ''known'' from what is ''unknown'' at each stage of discovery. Models, in both science and mathematics, need to be internally consistent and also ought to be ''[[falsifiable]]'' (capable of disproof). In mathematics, a statement need not yet be proven; at such a stage, that statement would be called a [[conjecture]]. But when a statement has attained mathematical proof, that statement gains a kind of immortality which is highly prized by mathematicians, and for which some mathematicians devote their lives.&lt;ref&gt;
"When we are working intensively, we feel keenly the progress of our work; we are elated when our progress is rapid, we are depressed when it is slow." – the mathematician {{harvnb|Pólya|1957|p=131}} in the section on 'Modern [[heuristic]]'.&lt;/ref&gt;

Mathematical work and scientific work can inspire each other.&lt;ref&gt;
"Philosophy [i.e., physics] is written in this grand book – I mean the universe – which stands continually open to our gaze, but it cannot be understood unless one first learns to comprehend the language and interpret the characters in which it is written. It is written in the language of mathematics, and its characters are triangles, circles, and other geometrical figures, without which it is humanly impossible to understand a single word of it; without these, one is wandering around in a dark labyrinth." – Galileo Galilei, ''Il Saggiatore'' (''[[The Assayer]]'', 1623), as translated by [[Stillman Drake]] (1957), ''Discoveries and Opinions of Galileo'' pp. 237–38,
as quoted by {{harvnb|di Francia|1981|p=10}}.
&lt;/ref&gt; For example, the technical concept of [[time]] arose in [[science]], and timelessness was a hallmark of a mathematical topic. But today, the [[Poincaré conjecture]] has been proven using time as a mathematical concept in which objects can flow (see [[Ricci flow]]).

Nevertheless, the connection between mathematics and reality (and so science to the extent it describes reality) remains obscure. [[Eugene Wigner]]'s paper, ''[[The Unreasonable Effectiveness of Mathematics in the Natural Sciences]]'', is a very well known account of the issue from a Nobel Prize-winning physicist. In fact, some observers (including some well known mathematicians such as [[Gregory Chaitin]], and others such as [[Where Mathematics Comes From|Lakoff and Núñez]]) have suggested that mathematics is the result of practitioner bias and human limitation (including cultural ones), somewhat like the post-modernist view of science.

&lt;/ref&gt; show that the mathematical method and the scientific method differ in detail, while nevertheless resembling each other in using iterative or recursive steps.

In Pólya's view, ''understanding'' involves restating unfamiliar definitions in your own words, resorting to geometrical figures, and questioning what we know and do not know already; ''analysis'', which Pólya takes from [[Pappus of Alexandria|Pappus]],&lt;ref&gt;
{{harvnb|Pólya|1957|p=142}}
&lt;/ref&gt; involves free and heuristic construction of plausible arguments, [[working backward from the goal]], and devising a plan for constructing the proof; ''synthesis'' is the strict [[Euclid]]ean exposition of step-by-step details&lt;ref&gt;
{{harvnb|Pólya|1957|p=144}}
&lt;/ref&gt; of the proof; ''review'' involves reconsidering and re-examining the result and the path taken to it.

[[Carl Friedrich Gauss|Gauss]], when asked how he came about his [[theorem]]s, once replied "durch planmässiges Tattonieren" (through [[Constructivism (mathematics)|systematic palpable experimentation]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Mackay|1991}} p. 100&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Imre Lakatos]] argued that mathematicians actually use contradiction, criticism and revision as principles for improving their work.&lt;ref&gt;See the development, by generations of mathematicians, of [[Euler's formula for polyhedra]] as documented by {{Citation|first=Imre| last=Lakatos|year=1976|title=Proofs and refutations|authorlink=Imre Lakatos |location=Cambridge |publisher=Cambridge University Press| isbn=978-0521290388| title-link=Proofs and refutations}}&lt;/ref&gt; In like manner to science, where truth is sought, but certainty is not found, in ''Proofs and refutations'' (1976), what Lakatos tried to establish was that no theorem of [[informal mathematics]] is final or perfect. This means that we should not think that a theorem is ultimately true, only that no [[counterexample]] has yet been found. Once a counterexample, i.e. an entity contradicting/not explained by the theorem is found, we adjust the theorem, possibly extending the domain of its validity. This is a continuous way our knowledge accumulates, through the logic and process of proofs and refutations. (If axioms are given for a branch of mathematics, however, Lakatos claimed that proofs from those [[axiom]]s were [[Tautology (logic)|tautological]], i.e. [[logical truth|logically true]], by [[string rewriting system|rewriting]] them, as did Poincaré (''Proofs and Refutations'', 1976).)

Lakatos proposed an account of mathematical knowledge based on Polya's idea of [[heuristic]]s. In ''Proofs and Refutations'', Lakatos gave several basic rules for finding proofs and counterexamples to conjectures. He thought that mathematical '[[thought experiment]]s' are a valid way to discover mathematical conjectures and proofs.&lt;ref&gt;Lakatos, Imre (Worrall &amp; Zahar, eds. 1976) ''[[Proofs and Refutations]]'', p. 55&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Relationship with statistics ===

The scientific method has been extremely successful in bringing the world out of medieval thinking, especially once it was combined with industrial processes.&lt;ref&gt;Rosenberg, Nathan; Luther Earle Birdzell; Mitchell, Glenn William. ''How the West grew Rich''. Popular Prakashan, 1986. [http://vedpuriswar.org/Book_Review/Economics/How%20the%20West%20grew%20rich.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt; However, when the scientific method employs statistics as part of its arsenal, there are mathematical and practical issues that can have a deleterious effect on the reliability of the output of scientific methods. This is described in a popular 2005 scientific paper "Why Most Published Research Findings Are False" by [[John Ioannidis]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Why Most Published Research Findings Are False|journal = PLoS Medicine|date = 2005-08-01|issn = 1549-1277|pmc = 1182327|pmid = 16060722|volume = 2|issue = 8|pages = e124|doi = 10.1371/journal.pmed.0020124|first = John P.A.|last = Ioannidis}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The particular points raised are statistical ("The smaller the studies conducted in a scientific field, the less likely the research findings are to be true" and "The greater the flexibility in designs, definitions, outcomes, and analytical modes in a scientific field, the less likely the research findings are to be true.") and economical ("The greater the financial and other interests and prejudices in a scientific field, the less likely the research findings are to be true" and "The hotter a scientific field (with more scientific teams involved), the less likely the research findings are to be true.") Hence: "Most research findings are false for most research designs and for most fields" and "As shown, the majority of modern biomedical research is operating in areas with very low pre- and poststudy probability for true findings." However: "Nevertheless, most new discoveries will continue to stem from hypothesis-generating research with low or very low pre-study odds," which means that *new* discoveries will come from research that, when that research started, had low or very low odds (a low or very low chance) of succeeding. Hence, if the scientific method is used to expand the frontiers of knowledge, research into areas that are outside the mainstream will yield most new discoveries.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8761">'''Scopophilia''' or '''scoptophilia''' (from {{lang-grc|σκοπέω}} {{lang|grc-Latn|skopeō}}, "look to, examine" and {{lang|grc|φῐλῐ́ᾱ}} {{lang|grc-Latn|philíā}}, "tendency toward"), is deriving pleasure from looking. As an expression of [[Human sexuality|sexuality]], it refers to [[sexual pleasure]] derived from looking at erotic objects: erotic photographs, [[pornography]], [[nudity|naked bodies]], etc.

==Psychoanalysis==

The term was introduced to translate [[Freud]]'s {{lang|de|Schaulust}}, or pleasure in looking.&lt;ref&gt;[[Jacques Lacan]], ''The Four Fundamental Concepts of Psycho-Analysis'' (1994) p. 194&lt;/ref&gt; Freud considered pleasure in looking to be a regular partial instinct in childhood,&lt;ref&gt;Sigmund Freud, ''On Sexuality'' (PFL 7) pp. 109–10&lt;/ref&gt; which might be sublimated into interest in art, or alternatively become fixated into what the [[Rat Man]] called "a burning and tormenting curiosity to see the female body".&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in Sigmund Freud, ''Case Histories II'' (PFL 9) pp. 41–2&lt;/ref&gt;

Freud thought that inhibition of scopophilia might lead to actual disturbances of vision;&lt;ref&gt;Sigmund Freud, ''On Psychopathology'' (PFL 10) pp. 112–3&lt;/ref&gt; other analysts have suggested that it might lead to a retreat from concrete objects into a world of abstractions.&lt;ref&gt;Otto Fenichel, ''The Psychoanalytic Theory of Neurosis'' (1946) p. 177&lt;/ref&gt;

Scopophilia was developed in the psychoanalytic theorizing of [[Otto Fenichel]], with special reference to [[Identification (psychology)|identification]].&lt;ref&gt;Otto Fenichel, [https://books.google.com/books?id=zk5gPgAACAAJ&amp;dq=the+collected+papers+of+otto+fenichel&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=ZhhhTbTNGc3Oswa3uLW1CA&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=2&amp;ved=0CDAQ6AEwAQ ''The Scoptophilic Instinct and Identification''] (1953) {{ISBN|0-393-33741-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fenichel maintained that "a child who is looking for libidinous purposes...wants to look at an object in order to 'feel along with him'".&lt;ref&gt;Fenichel, ''Theory'', p. 71&lt;/ref&gt; He also explored how looking could substitute for acting in those anxious to avoid guilt.&lt;ref&gt;Fenichel, ''Theory'', p. 348&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Jacques Lacan]] subsequently drew on [[Sartre]]'s theory of the gaze to link scopophilia with the apprehension of the other: "the gaze is this object lost and suddenly refound in the conflagration of shame, by the introduction of the other".&lt;ref&gt;Lacan, p. 183&lt;/ref&gt; Lacan privileged scopophilia in his theory of how desire is captured by the [[The Imaginary (psychoanalysis)|imaginary]] image of the other;&lt;ref&gt;Jacques Lacan, ''Television'' (1990) p. 86&lt;/ref&gt; other French analysts have emphasised how the discovery of sexual difference in childhood, and the accompanying sense of not knowing subsequently fuels the scopophilic drive.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Schneiderman|first1=Stuart|title=Returning to Freud: Clinical Psychoanalysis in the School of Lacan|date=1980|publisher=Yale University Press|isbn=9780300039320|page=224}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cinema==

[[Voyeurism]] plays a role in the films of [[Alfred Hitchcock]], most notably in the 1960 film, ''[[Psycho (1960 film)|Psycho]]''. In the film, [[Norman Bates]] is revealed to have a peephole to one of the hotel rooms. He uses this to spy on [[Marion Crane]], while she is in a state of undress.

Scopophilia is mentioned by name in director Michael Powell's ''Peeping Tom'' (1960). The entire film is an exercise in voyeurism. Powell, and his screenwriter, Leo Marks, created to prove to what extent how one is capable of watching things one shouldn't watch. At the same time, Powell created a psychological essay about what makes Mark Lewis, the central character of the film, act the way he acted. Mark has been scarred for life thanks to what his own father did to him during a period of his growing years that formed his character into the reclusive man who feels at home doing the despicable crimes he commits. (I.M.D.B.)

[[scopophobia]]).

In their theories scopophilia is a question of fixing the appearance and identity of the other through the gaze. So cultural scopophilia restricts the visible representations of racial identity that it allows.&lt;ref&gt;Todd W. Reeser, ''Masculinities in Theory'' (2011) pp. 164–5&lt;/ref&gt;

==Literary examples==
* The ''[[Satyricon]]'' of [[Gaius Petronius Arbiter]] is pervaded with scopophilia, as when a priestess of [[Priapus]] was "the first to put an inquisitive eye to a crack she had naughtily opened, and spy on their play with prurient eagerness".&lt;ref&gt;Petronius, ''[[The Satyricon]]'' (Penguin 1986) p. 50 and p. 188&lt;/ref&gt;
* In ''Secret Sexualities'', Ian McCormick notes the inter-relationship of public and private, and of the open and the secret, as features that constitute transgressive or forbidden sexualities. In this respect, there is an example from Fanny's observation of two sodomites in ''Memoirs of a Woman of Pleasure'' (1749): 'at length I observed a paper patch of the same colour as the wainscot, which I took to conceal some flaw; but then it was so high, that I was obliged to stand upon a chair to reach it, which I did as soft as possible, and, with a point of a bodkin, soon pierced it, and opened myself espial room sufficient. And now, applying my eye close, I commanded the room perfectly, and could see my two young sparks romping and pulling one another about, entirely, to my imagination, in frolic and innocent play.' &lt;ref&gt;McCormick, Ian.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5763">The '''self-consistent mean field (SCMF)''' method is an adaptation of [[mean field theory]] used in [[protein structure prediction]] to determine the optimal [[amino acid]] [[side chain]] packing given a fixed [[tertiary structure|protein backbone]]{{ref|Koehl}}. It is faster but less accurate than [[dead-end elimination]] and is generally used in situations where the protein of interest is too large for the problem to be tractable by DEE{{ref|Voigt}}.

==General principles==
Like dead-end elimination, the SCMF method explores conformational space by discretizing the [[dihedral angle]]s of each side chain into a set of [[rotamer]]s for each position in the protein sequence. The method iteratively develops a probabilistic description of the relative population of each possible rotamer at each position, and the probability of a given structure is defined as a function of the probabilities of its individual rotamer components.

The basic requirements for an effective SCMF implementation are:
# A well-defined finite set of discrete independent variables
# A precomputed numerical value (considered the "energy") associated with each element in the set of variables, and associated with each binary element pair
# An initial probability distribution describing the starting population of each individual rotamer
# A way of updating rotamer energies and probabilities as a function of the mean-field energy

The process is generally initialized with a uniform probability distribution over the rotamers&amp;nbsp;— that is, if there are &lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt; rotamers at the &lt;math&gt;kth&lt;/math&gt; position in the protein, then the probability of any individual rotamer &lt;math&gt;r_{k}^{A}&lt;/math&gt; is &lt;math&gt;1/p&lt;/math&gt;. The conversion between energies and probabilities is generally accomplished via the [[Boltzmann distribution]], which introduces a temperature factor (thus making the method amenable to [[simulated annealing]]). Lower temperatures increase the likelihood of converging to a single solution, rather than to a small subpopulation of solutions.

==Mean-field energies==
The energy of an individual rotamer &lt;math&gt;r_{k}&lt;/math&gt; is dependent on the "mean-field" energy of the other positions&amp;nbsp;— that is, at every other position, each rotamer's energy contribution is proportional to its probability. For a protein of length &lt;math&gt;N&lt;/math&gt; with &lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt; rotamers per residue, the energy at the current iteration is described by the following expression. Note that for clarity, the mean-field energy at iteration &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt; is denoted by &lt;math&gt;M_{i}&lt;/math&gt;, whereas the precomputed energies are denoted by &lt;math&gt;E&lt;/math&gt;, and the probability of a given rotamer is denoted by &lt;math&gt;P_{i}(r_{k}^{A})&lt;/math&gt;.
:&lt;math&gt;
M_{i}(r_{k}^{A}) = E_{k}(r_{k}^{A}) + \sum_{x=1}^{N} \sum_{y=1}^{p} P_{i-1}(r_{x}^{y}) E_{xy}(r_{k}^{A}, r_{x}^{y})
&lt;/math&gt;

These mean-field energies are used to update the probabilities through the Boltzmann law:

:&lt;math&gt;
P_{i}(r_{k}^{A}) = \left(\exp\left(-\frac{M_{i}(r_{k}^{A})}{kT}\right)\right)\left(\sum_{y=1}^{p}\exp\left(-\frac{M_{i}(r_{k}^{y})}{kT}\right)\right)^{-1}
&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt; is the [[Boltzmann constant]] and &lt;math&gt;T&lt;/math&gt; is the temperature factor.

==Energy of the system==
Although computing the system energy is not required in carrying out the SCMF method, it is useful to know the overall energies of the converged results. The system energy &lt;math&gt;M_{sys}&lt;/math&gt; consists of two sums:

:&lt;math&gt;
M_{sys} = M_{single} + M_{pair}
&lt;/math&gt;
where the addends are defined as:
:&lt;math&gt;
M_{single} = \sum_{x=1}^{N} \sum_{y=1}^{p} P(r_{x}^{y})E_{x}(r_{x}^{y})
&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;
M_{pair} = \sum_{x=1}^{N} \sum_{y=1}^{p} \sum_{a=x+1}^{N} \sum_{b=1}^{p} \left(P(r_{x}^{y})P(r_{a}^{b})E_{xy}(r_{x}^{y}, r_{a}^{b})\right)
&lt;/math&gt;

==Convergence==
Perfect convergence for the SCMF method would result in a probability of 1 for exactly one rotamer at each position &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt; in the protein, and a probability of zero for all other rotamers at each position. Convergence to a unique solution requires probabilities close to 1 for exactly one rotamer at each position. In practice, especially when higher temperatures are used, the algorithm instead identifies a small number of high-probability rotamers at each position, allowing the resulting conformations' relative energies to then be enumerated (based on the precomputed energies, not on those derived from the mean-field approximation). One way to improve convergence is to run again at a lower temperature using the probabilities calculated from a previous higher-temperature run.

==Accuracy==
Unlike dead-end elimination, SCMF is not guaranteed to converge on the optimal solution. However, it is deterministic (as in, it will converge to the same solution every time given the same initial conditions), unlike alternatives that rely on Monte Carlo analysis. By comparison to DEE, which is guaranteed to find the optimal solution, SCMF is faster but less accurate overall; it is significantly better at identifying correct side chain conformations in the protein's core than it is on identifying correct surface conformations{{ref|Voigt}}. Geometric packing constraints are less restrictive on the surface and thus provide fewer boundaries to the conformational search.

'''Serum-derived bovine immunoglobulin/protein isolate''' ('''SBI''') is a medical food product derived from bovine serum obtained from adult cows in the United States.

== Mechanism of Action ==
Unlike common dietary proteins, SBI contains a concentrated source of ~60 immunoglobulin (&gt;50% IgG, 1% IgA, and 5% IgM), 5% albumin and other proteins and peptides that may aid in the management of chronic diarrhea or loose and frequent stools. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ciampa|first=B|date=February 2017|title=The Emerging Therapeutic Role of Medical Foods for Gastrointestinal Disorders.|url=http://www.gastroenterologyandhepatology.net/archives/february-2017/the-emerging-therapeutic-role-of-medical-foods-for-gastrointestinal-disorders/|journal=Gastroenterology &amp; Hepatology|volume=13|issue=2|pages=104|}}&lt;/ref&gt; Immunoglobulins found in SBI have been shown to bind to microbial components with immune-activating potential from a variety of bacteria, fungi and viruses, including those implicated in human disease.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Horgan|first=A|date=April 26–30, 2014|title=Serum-derived bovine immunoglobulin/protein isolate binds to pathogen associated molecular patterns.|url=http://www.fasebj.org/content/28/1_Supplement/836.6|journal=FASEB J.|volume=28|issue=Suppl 1 |pages=836.6|doi=10.1096/fasebj.28.1_supplement.836.6|doi-broken-date=2018-10-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; The putative mechanism of action features, this binding of inflammatory antigens may prevent their passage into the lamina propria of the bowel wall, presumably due steric exclusion.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Detzel|first=CJ|date=April 2015|title=Bovine immunoglobulin/protein isolate binds pro-inflammatory bacterial compounds and prevents immune activation in an intestinal co-culture model|journal=PLOS One|volume=10 |issue=4|pages=e0120278|pmc=4382133|pmid=25830826|doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0120278}}&lt;/ref&gt; The resultant dampening of immune response in the gut-associated lymphoid tissue (GALT) is believed to allow for restoration of intestinal homeostasis, leading to resumption of normal gut function and nutrient absorption.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Petschow|first=Bryon W.|date=May 2014|title=Serum-derived bovine immunoglobulin/protein isolate: postulated mechanism of action for management of enteropathy|url=|journal=Clinical and Experimental Gastroenterology|volume=7|pages=181–90|via=|pmid=24904221|pmc=4041178|doi=10.2147/CEG.S62823}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The therapeutic effect of SBI's action on various GI conditions with chronic diarrhea provides a specific nutritional benefit that cannot be provided by normal dietary proteins alone or by increased intake of foods which contain immunoglobulin (i.e., meat, dairy).&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Petschow|first=Bryon W|date=January 2015|title=Dietary Requirement for Serum-Derived Bovine Immunoglobulins in the Clinical Management of Patients with Enteropathy|url=|journal=Digestive Diseases and Sciences|volume=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Institute was founded in 1970 by the [[German Bishops' Conference]] under the auspices of the [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Essen]]. The founding director was the [[Jesuit]] [[Joseph List]], supported by Heiner and Karl Eugen Schlief Marré. Since 1975, it has been run by the Association of German Dioceses (German: ''Verband der Diözesen Deutschlands'', or VDD).

==Purpose==
The purpose of the Institute is the academic study of the public law on state–church relations in theory and practice. In addition to providing legal advice to church organizations and providing information on legal developments in the field of state–church relations, the Institute is tasked with observing the development of the relationship between state, religion and the [[Catholic Church|Church]].&lt;ref name="dbk"&gt;

'''''The Making of a Moonie: Choice or Brainwashing?''''' is a 1984 [[book]] written by British [[Sociology|sociologist]] [[Eileen Barker]], [[Blackwell's|Blackwell Publishers]], Oxford, United Kingdom, {{ISBN|0-631-13246-5}}.

The book describes the [[religious conversion]] process to the [[Unification Church]], whose members are sometimes informally referred to as "[[Moonie (nickname)|Moonies]]".

Barker spent close to seven years studying Unification Church members.  She interviewed in depth and/or gave probing questionnaires to Unification Church members, ex-members, "non-joiners," and control groups of uninvolved individuals from similar backgrounds, as well as parents, spouses, and friends of members. She also attended numerous Unification Church workshops and communal facilities.&lt;ref name="Rusher"&gt;[http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m1282/is_v38/ai_4580948 Review], [[William Rusher]], ''[[National Review]]'', December 19, 1986.&lt;/ref&gt;

Barker writes that she rejects the "[[brainwashing]]" theory as an explanation for conversion to the Unification Church, because, as she wrote, it explains neither the many people who attended a Unification Church recruitment meeting and did not become members, nor the voluntary disaffiliation of members. Reviewers have quoted her conclusions: "I have not been persuaded that they are brainwashed zombies,"&lt;ref name="Rusher" /&gt; and "Moonies are no more likely to stagnate into mindless robots than are their peers who travel to the city on the 8.23 each morning."&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20060618211708/http://web.uni-marburg.de/religionswissenschaft/journal/diskus/chryssides.html NEW RELIGIOUS MOVEMENTS - SOME PROBLEMS OF DEFINITION] [[George Chryssides]], ''Diskus'', 1997.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2006 [[Laurence Iannaccone]] of [[George Mason University]], a specialist in the [[theory of religious economy|economics of religion]], wrote that ''The Making of a Moonie'' was "one of the most comprehensive and influential studies" of the process of conversion to [[new religious movement]]s.&lt;ref&gt;[http://faculty.arec.umd.edu/cmcausland/RALi/The%20Market%20for%20Martyrs.pdf The Market for Martyrs] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120111212356/http://faculty.arec.umd.edu/cmcausland/RALi/The%20Market%20for%20Martyrs.pdf |date=2012-01-11 }}, [[Laurence Iannaccone]], [[George Mason University]], 2006, "One of the most comprehensive and influential studies was The Making of a Moonie: Choice or Brainwashing? by Eileen Barker (1984). Barker could find no evidence that Moonie recruits were ever kidnapped, confined, or coerced. Participants at Moonie retreats were not [[deprived of sleep]]; the lectures were not “trance-inducing”; and there was not much chanting, no drugs or alcohol, and little that could be termed “frenzy” or “ecstatic” experience. People were free to leave, and leave they did. Barker’s extensive enumerations showed that among the recruits who went so far as to attend two-day retreats (claimed to beMoonie’s most effective means of “brainwashing”), fewer than 25% joined the group formore than a week and only 5% remained full-time members one year later. And, of course, most contacts dropped out before attending a retreat. Of all those who visited a Moonie centre at least once, not one in two-hundred remained in the movement two years later. With failure rates exceeding 99.5%, it comes as no surprise that full-time Moonie membership in the U.S. never exceeded a few thousand. And this was one of the most New Religious Movements of the era!"&lt;/ref&gt; Australian psychologist Len Oakes and British psychiatry professor [[Anthony Storr]], who have written rather critically about [[cult]]s, [[guru]]s, [[new religious movement]]s, and their leaders have praised ''The Making of a Moonie''.&lt;ref&gt;Oakes, Len "By far the best study of the conversion process is Eileen Barker’s The Making of a Moonie [...]" from ''Prophetic Charisma: The Psychology of Revolutionary Religious Personalities'', 1997, {{ISBN|0-8156-0398-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Storr, Anthony Dr. ''Feet of clay: a study of gurus'' 1996 {{ISBN|0-684-83495-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was given the Distinguished Book Award for 1985 by the [[Society for the Scientific Study of Religion]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sssrweb.org/PastWinners.cfm Past Winners] {{webarchive|url=https://www.webcitation.org/5nkN0WHJc?url=http://www.sssrweb.org/PastWinners.cfm |date=2010-02-23 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Vitalism''' is the belief that "living organisms are fundamentally different from non-living entities because they contain some non-physical element or are governed by different principles than are inanimate things".&lt;ref name=Bechtel&gt;{{cite book |url=http://mechanism.ucsd.edu/teaching/philbio/vitalism.htm |author=Bechtel, William; Williamson, Robert C. |year=1998 |title=Vitalism |editor=E.

In the 18th and 19th centuries vitalism was [[Alternatives to evolution by natural selection|discussed among biologists]], between those who felt that the known mechanics of physics would eventually explain the difference between life and non-life and vitalists who argued that the processes of life could not be reduced to a mechanistic process. Some vitalist biologists proposed [[Falsifiability|testable hypotheses]] meant to show inadequacies with mechanistic explanations, but these experiments failed to provide support for vitalism. Biologists now consider vitalism in this sense to have been refuted by [[Scientific evidence|empirical evidence]], and hence regard it as a [[Superseded scientific theories|superseded scientific theory]].&lt;ref name="Williams2003"&gt;{{cite book |last=Williams |first=Elizabeth Ann |title=A Cultural History of Medical Vitalism in Enlightenment Montpellier |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=AvqYl4sdwaYC&amp;pg=PA4 |year=2003 |publisher=Ashgate |isbn=978-0-7546-0881-3 |page=4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Vitalism has a long history in [[medical]] philosophies: many [[traditional medicine|traditional healing]] practices posited that disease results from some imbalance in vital forces.

== History ==

===Ancient times===
The notion that bodily functions are due to a vitalistic principle existing in all living creatures has roots going back at least to ancient [[Egypt]].&lt;ref&gt;Jidenu, Paulin (1996) ''African Philosophy, 2nd Ed.'' Indiana University Press, {{ISBN|0-253-21096-8}}, p.16.&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Greek philosophy]], the [[Milesian school]] proposed natural explanations [[deductive argument|deduced]] from [[materialism]] and [[Mechanism (philosophy)|mechanism]]. However, by the time of [[Lucretius]], this account was supplemented, (for example, by the unpredictable ''[[clinamen]]'' of [[Epicurus]]), and in [[Stoic physics]], the ''[[pneuma]]'' assumed the role of ''[[logos]]''. [[Galen]] believed the lungs draw pneuma from the air, which the blood communicates throughout the body.&lt;ref&gt;Birch, Charles; Cobb, John B. ''The Liberation of Life: From the Cell to the Community'', 1985, p. 75&lt;/ref&gt;

===Medieval===
In Europe, medieval physics was influenced by the idea of pneuma, helping to shape later [[aether theories]].

===Early modern===
Vitalists included English anatomist [[Francis Glisson]] (1597–1677) and the Italian doctor [[Marcello Malpighi]] (1628–1694).&lt;ref name="Charles Birch 1985, pp. 76"&gt;Birch, Charles; Cobb, John B. ''The Liberation of Life: From the Cell to the Community'', 1985, pp. 76–78&lt;/ref&gt; [[Caspar Friedrich Wolff]] (1733–1794) is considered to be the father of [[Epigenesis (biology)|epigenesis]] in [[embryology]], that is, he marks the point when embryonic development began to be described in terms of the proliferation of cells rather than the incarnation of a preformed soul. However, this degree of empirical observation was not matched by a mechanistic philosophy: in his ''[[Theoria Generationis]]'' (1759), he tried to explain the emergence of the organism by the actions of a ''vis essentialis'' (an organizing, formative force), stating "All believers in epigenesis are vitalists." [[Carl Reichenbach]] (1788–1869) later developed the theory of [[Odic force]], a form of life-energy that permeates living things.

In the 17th century, modern science responded to [[Isaac Newton|Newton]]'s [[action at a distance]] and the mechanism of [[Cartesian dualism]] with vitalist theories: that whereas the chemical transformations undergone by non-living substances are reversible, so-called "organic" matter is permanently altered by chemical transformations (such as cooking).&lt;ref name=Ede/&gt;

[[Johann Friedrich Blumenbach]] was influential in establishing epigenesis in the life sciences in 1781 with his publication of ''Über den Bildungstrieb und das Zeugungsgeschäfte''. Blumenbach cut up freshwater ''[[Hydra (zoology)|Hydra]]'' and established that the removed parts would regenerate. He inferred the presence of a "formative drive" (''Bildungstrieb'') in living matter. But he pointed out that this name, "like names applied to every other kind of vital power, of itself, explains nothing: it serves merely to designate a peculiar power formed by the combination of the mechanical principle with that which is susceptible of modification". In the early 18th century, the physicians [[Marie François Xavier Bichat]] and [[John Hunter (surgeon)|John Hunter]] recognized a "living principle" in addition to mechanics.&lt;ref name="Charles Birch 1985, pp. 76" /&gt;

===19th century===
[[File:Albert Edelfelt - Louis Pasteur - 1885.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Louis Pasteur]] argued that only life could catalyse [[fermentation]]. Painting by [[Albert Edelfelt]], 1885]]
{{further|Alternatives to Darwinism}}

[[Jöns Jakob Berzelius]], one of the early 19th century fathers of modern [[chemistry]], argued that a regulative force must exist within living matter to maintain its functions.&lt;ref name=Ede&gt;Ede, Andrew. (2007) ''The Rise and Decline of Colloid Science in North America, 1900–1935: The Neglected Dimension'', p. 23&lt;/ref&gt; Vitalist chemists predicted that organic materials could not be synthesized from inorganic components, but [[Friedrich Wöhler]] synthesised [[urea]] from inorganic components in 1828.&lt;ref&gt;[http://content.karger.com/ProdukteDB/produkte.asp?Aktion=ShowPDF&amp;ProduktNr=223979&amp;Ausgabe=225203&amp;ArtikelNr=13463&amp;filename=13463.pdf Vitalism and Synthesis of Urea]&lt;/ref&gt; However, contemporary accounts do not support the common belief that vitalism died when Wöhler made urea. This ''Wöhler Myth'', as historian Peter Ramberg called it, originated from a popular history of chemistry published in 1931, which, "ignoring all pretense of historical accuracy, turned Wöhler into a crusader who made attempt after attempt to synthesize a natural product that would refute vitalism and lift the veil of ignorance, until 'one afternoon the miracle happened'".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bioethicsjournal.com/past/cheng.html ''The Real Death of Vitalism: Implications of the Wöhler Myth'']&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Schummer, J. http://www.joachimschummer.net/papers/2003_NatureChemistry_SHPS.pdf, 2003&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;In 1845, [[Adolph Kolbe]] succeeded in making acetic acid from inorganic compounds, and in the 1850s, [[Marcellin Berthelot]] repeated this feat for numerous organic compounds. In retrospect, Wöhler's work was the beginning of the end of Berzelius's vitalist hypothesis, but only in retrospect, as Ramberg had shown.&lt;/ref&gt;

Between 1833 and 1844, [[Johannes Peter Müller]] wrote a book on [[physiology]] called ''Handbuch der Physiologie'', which became the leading textbook in the field for much of the nineteenth century. The book showed Müller's commitments to vitalism; he questioned why organic matter differs from inorganic, then proceeded to chemical analyses of the blood and lymph. He describes in detail the circulatory, lymphatic, respiratory, digestive, endocrine, nervous, and sensory systems in a wide variety of animals but explains that the presence of a [[soul]] makes each organism an indivisible whole. He also claimed the behavior of light and sound waves showed that living organisms possessed a life-energy for which physical laws could never fully account.&lt;ref&gt;{{unreliable source?|date=February 2015}} http://vlp.mpiwg-berlin.mpg.de/pdfgen/essays/enc22.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Louis Pasteur]] (1822–1895) after his famous rebuttal of [[spontaneous generation]], performed several experiments that he felt supported vitalism. According to Bechtel, Pasteur "fitted fermentation into a more general programme describing special reactions that only occur in living organisms. These are irreducibly vital phenomena." Rejecting the claims of Berzelius, [[Liebig]], [[Moritz Traube|Traube]] and others that fermentation resulted from chemical agents or catalysts within cells, Pasteur concluded that fermentation was a "vital action".&lt;ref name=Bechtel/&gt;

===20th century===

[[Hans Driesch]] (1867–1941) interpreted his experiments as showing that life is not run by physicochemical laws.&lt;ref name="DevBio"&gt;{{Failed verification|date=February 2015}}[http://7e.devbio.com/article.php?ch=10&amp;id=110 Developmental Biology 8e Online: A Selective History of Induction] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061031180529/http://7e.devbio.com/article.php?ch=10&amp;id=110 |date=2006-10-31 }}&lt;/ref&gt; His main argument was that when one cuts up an embryo after its first division or two, each part grows into a complete adult. Driesch's reputation as an experimental biologist deteriorated as a result of his vitalistic theories, which scientists have seen since his time as pseudoscience.&lt;ref name="DevBio" /&gt;&lt;ref name=ps&gt;{{cite book |author1=Sebastian Normandin |author2=Charles T.

{{quote|It would be ahistorical to ridicule vitalists. When one reads the writings of one of the leading vitalists like Driesch one is forced to agree with him that many of the basic problems of biology simply cannot be solved by a philosophy as that of Descartes, in which the organism is simply considered a machine... The logic of the critique of the vitalists was impeccable.&lt;ref&gt;Mayr E (2002) ''The Walter Arndt Lecture: The Autonomy of Biology'', adapted for the internet, on {{cite web |url=http://www.biologie.uni-hamburg.de/b-online/e01_2/autonomy.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2006-09-24 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060926210457/http://www.biologie.uni-hamburg.de/b-online/e01_2/autonomy.htm |archivedate=2006-09-26 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;}}
{{quote|Vitalism has become so disreputable a belief in the last fifty years that no biologist alive today would want to be classified as a vitalist. Still, the remnants of vitalist thinking can be found in the work of [[Alistair Hardy]], [[Sewall Wright]], and [[Charles Birch]], who seem to believe in some sort of nonmaterial principle in organisms.&lt;ref&gt;Ernst Mayr ''Toward a new philosophy of biology: observations of an evolutionist'' 1988, p. 13&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Other vitalists included [[Johannes Reinke]] and [[Oscar Hertwig]]. Reinke used the word ''neovitalism'' to describe his work, claiming that it would eventually be verified through experimentation, and that it was an improvement over the other vitalistic theories. The work of Reinke influenced [[Carl Jung]].&lt;ref&gt;Noll, Richard. "Jung's Concept of Die Dominanten (The Dominants)". https://www.academia.edu/6789277/Jungs_concept_of_die_Dominanten_the_Dominants_1997_&lt;/ref&gt;

[[John Scott Haldane]] adopted an anti-mechanist approach to biology and an [[idealist]] philosophy early on in his career. Haldane saw his work as a vindication of his belief that [[teleology]] was an essential concept in biology. His views became widely known with his first book ''Mechanism, life and personality'' in 1913.&lt;ref name="Peter J. Bowler 2001, pp. 168"&gt;Bowler, Peter J. Reconciling science and religion: the debate in early-twentieth-century Britain, 2001, pp. 168–169&lt;/ref&gt; Haldane borrowed arguments from the vitalists to use against mechanism; however, he was not a vitalist. Haldane treated the organism as fundamental to biology: "we perceive the organism as a self-regulating entity", "every effort to analyze it into components that can be reduced to a mechanical explanation violates this central experience".&lt;ref name="Peter J. Bowler 2001, pp. 168" /&gt; The work of Haldane was an influence on [[organicism]].

Haldane also stated that a purely mechanist interpretation can not account for the characteristics of life. Haldane wrote a number of books in which he attempted to show the invalidity of both vitalism and mechanist approaches to science. Haldane explained:

{{quote|We must find a different theoretical basis of biology, based on the observation that all the phenomena concerned tend towards being so coordinated that they express what is normal for an adult organism.|&lt;ref name="Mark A. Bedau 2010, p. 95" /&gt;}}

By 1931, biologists had "almost unanimously abandoned vitalism as an acknowledged belief."&lt;ref name="Mark A. Bedau 2010, p. 95"&gt;Bedau, Mark A.; Cleland, Carol E. ''The Nature of Life: Classical and Contemporary Perspectives from Philosophy and Science'', 2010, p. 95&lt;/ref&gt;

== Emergentism ==
{{main|Emergentism}}

Some aspects of contemporary science make reference to [[emergence|emergent processes]]; those in which the properties of a system cannot be fully described in terms of the properties of the constituents.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1=Schultz | first1=S.G. | title=A century of (epithelial) transport physiology: from vitalism to molecular cloning | journal=The American Journal of Physiology | volume=274 | issue=1 Pt 1 | pages=C13–23 | year=1998 | pmid=9458708 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1=Gilbert | first1=S.F. | last2=Sarkar | first2=S. | title=Embracing complexity: organicism for the 21st century | journal=Developmental Dynamics | volume=219 | issue=1 | pages=1–9 | year=2000 | pmid=10974666 | doi=10.1002/1097-0177(2000)9999:9999&lt;::AID-DVDY1036&gt;3.0.CO;2-A }}&lt;/ref&gt; This may be because the properties of the constituents are not fully understood, or because the interactions between the individual constituents are also important for the behavior of the system.

Whether emergence should be grouped with traditional vitalist concepts is a matter of semantic controversy.&lt;ref&gt;see "Emergent Properties" in the ''Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy''. online at [http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/properties-emergent/ Stanford University] for explicit discussion; briefly, some philosophers see emergentism as midway between traditional spiritual vitalism and mechanistic reductionism; others argue that, structurally, emergentism is equivalent to vitalism. See also Emmeche C (2001) Does a robot have an Umwelt? ''Semiotica'' 134: 653–693 [http://www.nbi.dk/~emmeche/cePubl/2001d.robumwelt.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt; According to Emmeche ''et al.'' (1997):

{{quote|On the one hand, many scientists and philosophers regard emergence as having only a pseudo-scientific status. On the other hand, new developments in physics, biology, psychology, and cross-disciplinary fields such as cognitive science, artificial life, and the study of non-linear dynamical systems have focused strongly on the high level 'collective behaviour' of complex systems, which is often said to be truly emergent, and the term is increasingly used to characterize such systems.|&lt;ref name="Emmeche 1997"&gt;Emmeche C (1997) Explaining Emergence: towards an ontology of levels. ''Journal for General Philosophy of Science'' [http://alf.nbi.dk/~emmeche/coPubl/97e.EKS/emerg.html available online] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061006171903/http://alf.nbi.dk/~emmeche/coPubl/97e.EKS/emerg.html |date=2006-10-06 }}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Emmeche ''et al.'' (1998) state that "there is a very important difference between the vitalists and the emergentists: the vitalist's creative forces were relevant only in organic substances, not in inorganic matter. Emergence hence is creation of new properties regardless of the substance involved." "The assumption of an extra-physical vitalis (vital force, [[entelechy]], [[élan vital]], etc.), as formulated in most forms (old or new) of vitalism, is usually without any genuine explanatory power. It has served altogether too often as an intellectual tranquilizer or verbal sedative—stifling scientific inquiry rather than encouraging it to proceed in new directions."&lt;ref&gt;[http://etext.lib.virginia.edu/cgi-local/DHI/dhicontrib2.cgi?id=dv3-69 Dictionary of the History of Ideas] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110511191629/http://etext.lib.virginia.edu/cgi-local/DHI/dhicontrib2.cgi?id=dv3-69 |date=2011-05-11 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Franz Anton Mesmer.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Franz Mesmer]] proposed the vitalist force of ''[[animal magnetism|magnétisme animal]]'' in animals with breath.]]

A popular vitalist theory of the 18th century was "[[animal magnetism]]", in the theories of [[Franz Mesmer]] (1734–1815). However, the use of the (conventional) English term ''animal magnetism'' to translate Mesmer's '''magnétisme animal''' can be misleading for three reasons:
* Mesmer chose his term to clearly distinguish his variant of ''magnetic'' force from those referred to, at that time, as ''mineral magnetism'', ''cosmic magnetism'' and ''planetary magnetism''.
* Mesmer felt that this particular force/power only resided in the bodies of humans and animals.
* Mesmer chose the word "''animal''," for its root meaning (from Latin ''animus''="breath") specifically to identify his force as a quality that belonged to all creatures with breath; viz., the animate beings: humans '''and''' animals.

Mesmer's ideas became so influential that King [[Louis XVI]] of France appointed two commissions to investigate [[mesmerism]]; one was led by [[Joseph-Ignace Guillotin]], the other, led by [[Benjamin Franklin]], included [[Jean Sylvain Bailly|Bailly]] and [[Lavoisier]]. The commissioners learned about Mesmeric theory, and saw its patients fall into fits and [[trance]]s. In Franklin's garden, a patient was led to each of five trees, one of which had been "mesmerized"; he hugged each in turn to receive the "vital fluid," but fainted at the foot of a 'wrong' one. At Lavoisier's house, four normal cups of water were held before a "sensitive" woman; the fourth produced convulsions, but she calmly swallowed the mesmerized contents of a fifth, believing it to be plain water. The commissioners concluded that "the fluid without imagination is powerless, whereas imagination without the fluid can produce the effects of the fluid."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1=Best | first1=M. | last2=Neuhauser | first2=D. | last3=Slavin | first3=L. | title=Evaluating Mesmerism, Paris, 1784: the controversy over the blinded placebo controlled trials has not stopped | url=http://qhc.bmjjournals.com/cgi/content/full/12/3/232 | journal=Quality &amp; safety in health care | volume=12 | issue=3 | pages=232–3 | year=2003 | pmid=12792017 | pmc=1743715 | doi=10.1136/qhc.12.3.232}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Medical philosophies ==

Vitalism has a long history in [[medical]] philosophies: many [[traditional medicine|traditional healing]] practices posited that disease results from some imbalance in vital forces. In the Western tradition founded by [[Hippocrates]], these vital forces were associated with the [[four temperaments]] and [[The four humours|humours]]; Eastern traditions posited an imbalance or blocking of [[qi]] or [[prana]]. One example of a similar notion in Africa is the [[Yoruba people|Yoruba]] concept of [[Ase (Yoruba)|ase]]. Today forms of vitalism continue to exist as philosophical positions or as tenets in some religious traditions.{{citation needed|date=April 2017}}

[[Complementary and alternative medicine]] therapies include [[energy therapy|energy therapies]],&lt;ref name="titleComplementary and Alternative Medicine – U.S. National Library of Medicine Collection Development Manual"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.nlm.nih.gov/tsd/acquisitions/cdm/subjects24.html |title=Complementary and Alternative Medicine – U.S. National Library of Medicine Collection Development Manual |accessdate=2008-03-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; associated with vitalism, especially biofield therapies such as [[therapeutic touch]], [[Reiki]], external [[qi]], [[chakra]] healing and SHEN therapy.&lt;ref name="Rubik"&gt;Rubik, ''Bioenergetic Medicines'', American Medical Student Association Foundation, viewed 28 November 2006, {{cite web |url=http://www.amsa.org/ICAM/C6.doc |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2006-12-02 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060214125248/https://www.amsa.org/ICAM/C6.doc |archivedate=2006-02-14 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In these therapies, the "[[subtle energy]]" field of a patient is manipulated by a  practitioner. The subtle energy is held to exist beyond the electromagnetic energy produced by the heart and brain. Beverly Rubik describes the biofield as a "complex, dynamic, extremely weak EM field within and around the human body...."&lt;ref name="Rubik" /&gt;

The founder of [[homeopathy]], [[Samuel Hahnemann]], promoted an immaterial, vitalistic view of disease: "...they are solely spirit-like (dynamic) derangements of the spirit-like power (the vital principle) that animates the human body." The view of disease as a dynamic disturbance of the immaterial and dynamic vital force is taught in many homeopathic colleges and constitutes a fundamental principle for many contemporary practising homeopaths.{{citation needed|date=April 2017}}

== Criticism ==
[[File:Pierre Mignard - Portrait de Jean-Baptiste Poquelin dit Molière (1622-1673) - Google Art Project (cropped).jpg|thumb|The 17th century French playwright [[Molière]] mocked vitalism in his 1673 play ''[[Le Malade imaginaire]]''.]]

Vitalism has sometimes been criticized as begging the question by inventing a name. [[Molière]] had famously parodied this fallacy in ''[[Le Malade imaginaire]]'', where a quack "answers" the question of "Why does [[opium]] cause sleep?" with "Because of its '''dormitive virtue''' (i.e., [[soporific]] power)."&lt;ref name="fr.wikisource.org"&gt;'' Mihi a docto doctore / Demandatur causam et rationem quare / Opium facit dormire. / A quoi respondeo, / Quia est in eo / Vertus dormitiva, / Cujus est natura / Sensus assoupire.'' [http://fr.wikisource.org/wiki/Le_Malade_imaginaire_-_3%C3%A8me_interm%C3%A8de Le Malade imaginaire, (French Wikisource)]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Thomas Henry Huxley]] compared vitalism to stating that water is the way it is because of its "aquosity".&lt;ref name="The Physical Basis of Life"&gt;[http://aleph0.clarku.edu/huxley/comm/PMG/PBofL.html The Physical Basis of Life], ''Pall Mall Gazette'', 1869&lt;/ref&gt; His grandson [[Julian Huxley]] in 1926 compared "vital force" or ''élan vital'' to explaining a railroad locomotive's operation by its ''élan locomotif'' ("locomotive force").

Another criticism is that vitalists have failed to rule out mechanistic explanations. This is rather obvious in retrospect for [[organic chemistry]] and [[developmental biology]], but the criticism goes back at least a century. In 1912, [[Jacques Loeb]] published ''The Mechanistic Conception of Life'', in which he described experiments on how a sea urchin could have a pin for its father, as [[Bertrand Russell]] put it (''Religion and Science''). He offered this challenge:

: "... we must either succeed in producing living matter artificially, or we must find the reasons why this is impossible." (pp.&amp;nbsp;5–6)

Loeb addressed vitalism more explicitly:

: "It is, therefore, unwarranted to continue the statement that in addition to the acceleration of oxidations the beginning of individual life is determined by the entrance of a metaphysical "life principle" into the egg; and that death is determined, aside from the cessation of oxidations, by the departure of this "principle" from the body. In the case of the evaporation of water we are satisfied with the explanation given by the kinetic theory of gases and do not demand that to repeat a well-known jest of Huxley the disappearance of the "aquosity" be also taken into consideration." (pp.&amp;nbsp;14–15)

Bechtel states that vitalism "is often viewed as [[Falsifiability|unfalsifiable]], and therefore a pernicious metaphysical doctrine."&lt;ref name=Bechtel/&gt; For many scientists, "vitalist" theories were unsatisfactory "holding positions" on the pathway to mechanistic understanding. In 1967, [[Francis Crick]], the co-discoverer of the structure of [[DNA]], stated "And so to those of you who may be vitalists I would make this prophecy: what everyone believed yesterday, and you believe today, only [[Crank (person)|cranks]] will believe tomorrow."&lt;ref name="Crick"&gt;Crick, Francis (1967) ''Of Molecules and Men''; Great Minds Series Prometheus Books 2004, reviewed [http://www.mala.bc.ca/~johnstoi/reviews/crickandkurtz.htm here]. Crick's remark is cited and discussed in: Hein H (2004) [http://www.springerlink.com/content/m821384707h6h254/fulltext.pdf Molecular biology vs. organicism: The enduring dispute between mechanism and vitalism.] ''Synthese'' 20:238–253, who describes Crick's remark as "raising spectral red herrings".&lt;/ref&gt;

While many vitalistic theories have in fact been falsified, notably Mesmerism, the [[pseudoscience|pseudoscientific]] retention of untested and untestable theories continues to this day. [[Alan Sokal]] published an analysis of the wide acceptance among professional nurses of "scientific theories" of spiritual healing. (Pseudoscience and Postmodernism: Antagonists or Fellow-Travelers?).&lt;ref name="Sokal"&gt;[http://physics.nyu.edu/faculty/sokal/pseudoscience_rev.pdf Pseudoscience and Postmodernism: Antagonists or Fellow-Travelers?]&lt;/ref&gt; Use of a technique called [[therapeutic touch]] was especially reviewed by Sokal, who concluded, "nearly all the pseudoscientific systems to be examined in this essay are based philosophically on vitalism" and added that "Mainstream science has rejected vitalism since at least the 1930s, for a plethora of good reasons that have only become stronger with time."&lt;ref name="Sokal" /&gt;

Joseph C. Keating, Jr.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ncmic.com/pages/ce/seminars/speakers/keating.htm Joseph C. Keating, Jr., PhD: Biographical sketch] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060525203939/http://www.ncmic.com/pages/ce/seminars/speakers/keating.htm |date=2006-05-25 }}&lt;/ref&gt; discusses vitalism's past and present roles in [[chiropractic]] and calls vitalism "a form of [[bio-theology]]." He further explains that:

: "Vitalism is that rejected tradition in biology which proposes that life is sustained and explained by an unmeasurable, intelligent force or energy. The supposed effects of vitalism are the manifestations of life itself, which in turn are the basis for inferring the concept in the first place. This circular reasoning offers pseudo-explanation, and may deceive us into believing we have explained some aspect of biology when in fact we have only labeled our ignorance. 'Explaining an unknown (life) with an unknowable (Innate),' suggests chiropractor Joseph Donahue, 'is absurd'."&lt;ref name="keating_innate"&gt;{{citation |title=The Meanings of Innate |author=Keating, Joseph C.  |volume=46 |issue=1 |pmc=2505097 |journal=The Journal of the Canadian Chiropractic Association |year=2002 |pages=4–10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Keating views vitalism as incompatible with scientific thinking:

: "Chiropractors are not unique in recognizing a tendency and capacity for self-repair and auto-regulation of human physiology. But we surely stick out like a sore thumb among professions which claim to be scientifically based by our unrelenting commitment to vitalism. So long as we propound the 'One cause, one cure' rhetoric of Innate, we should expect to be met by ridicule from the wider health science community. Chiropractors can't have it both ways. Our theories cannot be both dogmatically held vitalistic constructs and be scientific at the same time. The purposiveness, consciousness and rigidity of the Palmers' Innate should be rejected."&lt;ref name="keating_innate" /&gt;

Keating also mentions Skinner's viewpoint:

: "Vitalism has many faces and has sprung up in many areas of scientific inquiry. Psychologist [[B.F. Skinner]], for example, pointed out the irrationality of attributing behavior to mental states and traits. Such 'mental way stations,' he argued, amount to excess theoretical baggage which fails to advance cause-and-effect explanations by substituting an unfathomable psychology of 'mind'."&lt;ref name="keating_innate" /&gt;

According to Williams,&lt;ref name="Williams"&gt;Williams, W. (2000) ''The [[Encyclopedia of Pseudoscience]]. From Alien Abductions to Zone Therapy''. Facts on File. Conway, D. and L. Dalton, R. Dolby, R. Duval, H. Farrell, J. Frazier, J. McMillan, J. Melton, T. O'Niell, R. Shepherd, S. Utley, W. Williams. {{ISBN|0-8160-3351-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; "today, vitalism is one of the ideas that form the basis for many pseudoscientific health systems that claim that illnesses are caused by a disturbance or imbalance of the body's vital force." "Vitalists claim to be scientific, but in fact they reject the scientific method with its basic postulates of cause and effect and of provability. They often regard subjective experience to be more valid than objective material reality."

[[Victor J. Stenger|Victor Stenger]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.colorado.edu/philosophy/vstenger/Medicine/Biofield.html Victor J. Stenger's site] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303202347/http://www.colorado.edu/philosophy/vstenger/Medicine/Biofield.html |date=2016-03-03 }}&lt;/ref&gt; states that the term "bioenergetics" "is applied in biochemistry to refer to the readily measurable [[Biological thermodynamics|exchanges of energy]] within organisms, and between organisms and the environment, which occur by normal physical and chemical processes. This is not, however, what the new vitalists have in mind. They imagine the [[Energy (esotericism)|bioenergetic]] field as a holistic living force that goes beyond reductionist physics and chemistry."&lt;ref name=Stenger&gt;{{cite journal |last=Stenger |first=Victor J. |title=The Physics of 'Alternative Medicine': Bioenergetic Fields |journal=The Scientific Review of Alternative Medicine |date=Spring–Summer 1999 |volume=3 |issue=1 |url=http://www.sram.org/0301/bioenergetic-fields.html |authorlink=Victor_J_Stenger |access-date=2006-12-03 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061218144228/http://www.sram.org/0301/bioenergetic-fields.html |archive-date=2006-12-18 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Such a field is sometimes explained as electromagnetic, though some advocates also make confused appeals to quantum physics.&lt;ref name="Rubik" /&gt; Joanne Stefanatos states that "The principles of energy medicine originate in quantum physics."&lt;ref name="Stefanatos"&gt;Stefanatos, J. 1997, ''Introduction to Bioenergetic Medicine'', Shoen, A.M. and S.G. Wynn, ''Complementary and Alternative Veterinary Medicine: Principles and Practices'', Mosby-Yearbook, Chicago.&lt;/ref&gt; Stenger&lt;ref name="Stenger" /&gt; offers several explanations as to why this line of reasoning may be misplaced. He explains that energy exists in discrete packets called quanta. Energy fields are composed of their component parts and so only exist when quanta are present. Therefore, energy fields are not holistic, but are rather a system of discrete parts that must obey the laws of physics. This also means that energy fields are not instantaneous. These facts of quantum physics place limitations on the infinite, continuous field that is used by some theorists to describe so-called "human energy fields".&lt;ref name="Biley"&gt;Biley, Francis C. 2005, ''Unitary Health Care: Martha Rogers' Science of Unitary Human Beings'', University of Wales College of Medicine, viewed 30 November 2006, {{cite web |url=http://medweb.uwcm.ac.uk/martha/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2006-12-02 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061205024515/http://medweb.uwcm.ac.uk/martha/ |archivedate=2006-12-05 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Stenger continues, explaining that the effects of EM forces have been measured by physicists as accurately as one part in a billion and there is yet to be any evidence that living organisms emit a unique field.&lt;ref name="Stenger" /&gt;

Vitalistic thinking has also been identified in the naive biological theories of children: "Recent experimental results show that a majority of preschoolers tend to choose vitalistic explanations as most plausible. Vitalism, together with other forms of intermediate causality, constitute unique causal devices for naive biology as a core domain of thought."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi=10.1016/j.tics.2004.06.004 | last1=Inagaki | first1=K. | last2=Hatano | first2=G. | year=2004 | title='Vitalistic causality in young children's naive biology.' | url=| journal=Trends Cogn Sci | volume=8 | issue=8| pages=356–62 | pmid=15335462 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''When Bad Things Happen to Good People''''' ({{ISBN|1-4000-3472-8}}) is a 1981 book by [[Harold Kushner]], a [[Conservative Judaism|Conservative]] [[rabbi]].  Kushner addresses in the book one of the principal problems of [[theodicy]], the conundrum of why, if the universe was created and is governed by a [[God]] who is of a good and loving nature, there is nonetheless so much suffering and pain in it - essentially, the evidential [[problem of evil]].

The book is dedicated to the memory of his young son, Aaron, who died at the age of 14 in 1977 of the incurable genetic disease [[progeria]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.freep.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20080803/TWIST01/808030320/1128/twist]&lt;/ref&gt;
Rabbi Kushner's book was a ''New York Times'' bestseller for many months in the "nonfiction" category.

==Thesis==
Kushner seeks to offer comfort to grieving people. His answer to the philosophical problem is that God does his best and is with people in their suffering, but is not fully able to prevent it.&lt;ref name=Frame&gt;{{cite book|author1=John Frame|authorlink1=John Frame (theologian)|title=Apologetics to the Glory of God|date=1994|isbn=0-87552-243-2|page=157}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Kushner’s beliefs, which seem to question God’s [[omnipotence]], have been criticized by some conservative scholars associated with [[Orthodox Judaism]]&lt;ref&gt;Rabbi Y. Kirzner, ''Making Sense of Suffering'' {{ISBN|1-57819-757-0}}.&lt;/ref&gt; as well as [[evangelical Christianity]].&lt;ref name="Frame" /&gt;

'''Women in music''' describes the role of women as [[composer]]s, [[songwriter]]s, [[Musician|instrumental performers]], [[singer]]s, [[Conducting|conductors]], [[musicology|music scholars]], [[music teacher|music educators]], [[music criticism|music critic]]s/[[music journalist]]s and other musical professions. As well, it describes music movements (e.g., [[women's music]], which is music written and performed by women for women), events and genres related to [[Woman|women]], [[women's rights|women's issues]] and [[feminism]]. In the 2010s, while women constitute a significant proportion of [[popular music]] and [[classical music]] singers, and a significant proportion of songwriters (many of them being [[singer-songwriter]]s), there are few women [[record producer]]s, [[music journalist|rock critic]]s and rock instrumentalists. Notable women artists in pop, such as [[Bjork]] and [[Lady Gaga]] have commented about [[sexism]] and [[gender discrimination]] in the [[music industry]].&lt;ref name="newyorker.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.newyorker.com/culture/cultural-comment/the-world-needs-female-rock-critics|title=The World Needs Female Rock Critics|first=Anwen|last=Crawford|date=26 May 2015|accessdate=7 April 2018|website=Newyorker.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="people.com"&gt;{{cite web|first = Karen |last = Mizoguchi|title = Lady Gaga Calls Music Industry a 'F---king Boys Club' |work = People|date = 12 December 2015|url =  http://www.people.com/article/lady-gaga-music-industry-boys-club-billboard}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Additionally, a recent study led by Dr. Smith announced that "...over the last six years, the representation of women in the music industry has been even lower".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/25/arts/music/music-industry-gender-study-women-artists-producers.html|title=Gender Diversity in the Music Industry?

Women constitute a significant proportion of instrumental soloists in classical music and the percentage of women in orchestras is increasing. A 2015 article on concerto soloists in major Canadian orchestras, however, indicated that 84% of the soloists with the [[Orchestre Symphonique de Montreal]] were men.

According to Jessica Duchen, a music writer for London's ''[[The Independent]]'', women musicians in classical music are "too often judged for their appearances, rather than their talent" and they face pressure "to look sexy onstage and in photos."&lt;ref name="music.cbc.ca"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://music.cbc.ca/#!/blogs/2014/3/Classical-musics-shocking-gender-gap|title=CBC Music|website=music.cbc.ca|accessdate=7 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Duchen states that while "[t]here are women musicians who refuse to play on their looks...the ones who do tend to be more materially successful."&lt;ref name="music.cbc.ca"/&gt; According to the UK's Radio 3 editor, Edwina Wolstencroft, the music industry has long been open to having women in performance or entertainment roles, but women are much less likely to have positions of authority, such as being the [[Conducting|conductor of an orchestra]],&lt;ref name="theguardian.com"&gt;{{cite web|first=Jessica|last=Duchen |url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2015/feb/28/why-male-domination-of-classical-music-might-end |title=Why the male domination of classical music might be coming to an end &amp;#124; Music |publisher=The Guardian |date= |accessdate=2016-01-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; a profession which has been called "one of the last [[glass ceiling]]s in the [[music industry]]".&lt;ref name="motherjones.com"/&gt;  In popular music, while there are many women singers recording songs, there are very few women behind the [[Audio mixer|audio console]] acting as [[music producer]]s, the individuals who direct and manage the recording process.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt; One of the most recorded artists is a woman, [[Asha Bhosle]], an Indian singer who is best known as a [[playback singer]] in Hindi cinema.&lt;ref name="indiatoday.intoday.in"/&gt;

A songwriter is an individual who writes the [[lyrics]], [[melody|melodies]] and [[chord progression]]s for songs, typically for a [[popular music]] genre such as [[pop music|pop]], [[rock music|rock]] or [[country music]]. A songwriter can also be called a [[composer]], although the latter term tends to be mainly used for individuals from the classical music genre.

===19th century-early 20th century===
"Only a few of the many women [songwriters] in America had their music published and heard during the late 19th and early 20th centuries."&lt;ref name="parlorsongs.com"/&gt; According to Richard A. Reublin and Richard G. Beil, the "lack of mention of women [songwriters] is a glaring and embarrassing omission in our musical heritage."&lt;ref name="parlorsongs.com"/&gt; Women "struggled to write and publish music in the man's world of 20th century [[Tin Pan Alley]]. Prior to 1900 and even after, it was expected that "women would perform music, not make music."&lt;ref name="parlorsongs.com"/&gt; In 1880, Chicago music critic George P. Upton wrote the book ''Women In Music'', in which he argued that "women lacked the innate creativity to compose good music" due to the "biological predisposition" of women.&lt;ref name="parlorsongs.com"/&gt; Later, it was accepted that women would have a role in [[music education]], and they became involved in this field "to such a degree that women dominated music education during the later half of the 19th century and well into the 20th century."&lt;ref name="parlorsongs.com"/&gt; As part of women's role in music education, women wrote hymns and children's music. The "secular music in print in America before 1825 shows only about 70 works by women." In the mid 19th century, notable women songwriters emerged, including [[Faustina Hasse Hodges]], Susan Parkhurst, [[Augusta Browne]] and [[Marion Dix Sullivan]]. By 1900, there were many more women songwriters, but "many were still forced to use pseudonyms or initials" to hide the fact that they were women.&lt;ref name="parlorsongs.com"/&gt;

[[Carrie Jacobs-Bond]] was the "preeminent woman composer of the late 1800's and well into the middle of the twentieth century... [making her] the first million selling woman" songwriter.&lt;ref name="parlorsongs.com"/&gt; Maude Nugent (1877–1958) wrote "Sweet Rosie O'Grady" in 1896. She also penned "Down At Rosie Reilly's Flat", "My Irish Daisy" and "Mary From Tipperary".&lt;ref name="parlorsongs.com"/&gt; Charlotte Blake (1885–1979) was a staff writer for at the Whitney Warner Publishing Co., in Detroit, Michigan. Initially, the company billed her as "C. Blake" to hide her gender, but by 1906 ads used her full name.&lt;ref name="parlorsongs.com"/&gt; [[Caro Roma]] (1866–1937) was the gender-ambiguous pseudonym for [[Carrie Northly]]. She was "one of America's more well known and popular composers of the Tin Pan Alley era." Her songs include "Can't Yo' Heah Me Calling", "Faded Rose", "The Angelus", "Thinking of Thee" and "Resignation".&lt;ref name="parlorsongs.com"/&gt; About 95% of the songwriters in British [[music hall]] during the early 1900s were men; however, about 30% of the singers were women.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;John Mullen.

===New wave of female singer-songwriters===
By the late 1960s a new wave of female singer-songwriters broke from the confines of pop, using the urban landscape as their canvass for lyrics in the confessional style of poets like Anne Sexton and Sylvia Plath.  These pioneering women, appeared in a feature in [[Newsweek]], July, 1969, "The Girls: Letting Go": "What is common to them – to [[Joni Mitchell]] and [[Lotti Golden]], to [[Laura Nyro]], [[Melanie Safka|Melanie]], [[Janis Ian]] and to Elyse Weinberg, are the personalised songs they write, like voyages of self-discovery. [[Grace Slick]] a former model, was widely known in rock and roll history for her role in San Francisco's burgeoning psychedelic music scene in the mid–1960s." In ''[[The Guardian]]'', 26 January 2017, author Laura Barton describes the radical shift in subject matter — politics, drugs, disappointment, the isolation of the itinerant performer, and urban life.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2017/jan/26/from-joni-mitchell-to-laura-marling-how-female-troubadours-changed-music|title=From Joni Mitchell to Laura Marling: how female troubadours changed music|first=Laura|last=Barton|date=26 January 2017|website=the Guardian|accessdate=7 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Native New Yorker, [[Lotti Golden]], in her Atlantic debut album ''[[Motor-Cycle (album)|Motor-Cycle]]'', chronicled her life in NYC's East Village in the late '60s counterculture, visiting subjects such as gender identity (The Space Queens-Silky is Sad) and excessive drug use (Gonna Fay's).

===Musical theatre===
In [[musical theatre]], "female songwriters are rare in an industry dominated by males on the creative end.

==Composers==
[[File:Clara Wieck im Alter von 15 Jahren.jpg|thumb|right|upright|220px|Nineteenth-century composer and pianist [[Clara Schumann]]]]
{{See also|List of female composers by birth date}}
American musicologist [[Marcia Citron]] has asked "[w]hy is music composed by women so marginal to the standard  'classical' repertoire?"&lt;ref name="Citron, Marcia J 1993"&gt;Citron, Marcia J. Gender and the Musical Canon. CUP Archive, 1993.&lt;/ref&gt; Citron "examines the practices and attitudes that have led to the exclusion of women composers from the received '[[Western canon|canon]]' of performed musical works." She argues that in the 1800s, women composers typically wrote [[art song]]s for performance in small recitals rather than [[symphony|symphonies]] intended for performance with an orchestra in a large hall, with the latter works being seen as the most important genre for composers; since women composers did not write many symphonies, they were deemed to be not notable as composers.&lt;ref name="Citron, Marcia J 1993"/&gt;

According to Abbey Philips, "women musicians have had a very difficult time breaking through and getting the credit they deserve".&lt;ref name="rvanews.com"&gt;{{cite web|first=Abbey|last = Philips |url=http://rvanews.com/features/spacebomb-truth-lies-somewhere-in-between/49992 |title=Spacebomb: Truth lies somewhere in between |publisher=Rvanews.com |date=2011-09-01 |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the Medieval eras, most of the art music was created for liturgical (religious) purposes and due to the views about the roles of women that were held by religious leaders, few women composed this type of music, with the nun [[Hildegard von Bingen]] being among the exceptions. Most university textbooks on the history of music discuss almost exclusively the role of male composers. As well, very few works by women composers are part of the standard repertoire of classical music. In the ''Concise Oxford History of Music'', [[Clara Schumann]] is the only woman composer who is mentioned.&lt;ref name="rvanews.com"/&gt; Philips states that "[d]uring the 20th century the women who were composing/playing gained far less attention than their male counterparts".&lt;ref name="rvanews.com"/&gt;

===Medieval era===
{{Listen|filename=O frondens 2.ogg|title=''O frondens virga''|description=From ''[[Ordo Virtutum]]''|format=[[Ogg]]}}
[[Hildegard von Bingen]] (1098–1179) was a German [[Benedictine]] [[abbess]], composer, writer, philosopher, and [[visionary]].&lt;ref name="Bennett, Judith M 2001"&gt;Bennett, Judith M. and Hollister, Warren C. ''Medieval Europe: A Short History'' (New York: McGraw-Hill, 2001), p. 317.&lt;/ref&gt; One of her works as a composer, the ''[[Ordo Virtutum]]'', is an early example of liturgical drama and an early [[morality play]].  Some writers have speculated a distant origin for opera in this piece, though without any evidence.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.m-w.com/dictionary]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.medieval.org/emfaq/misc/opera.html alt Opera, see Florentine Camerata in the province of Milan, Italy].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kitbraz.com/gen/rev/1998nytmirapaulHild.html]&lt;/ref&gt; Sixty-nine musical compositions, each with its own original poetic text, survive. This is one of the largest repertoires among medieval composers. Hildegard composed many liturgical songs that were collected into a cycle called the ''Symphonia armoniae celestium revelationum.'' The songs from the Symphonia are set to Hildegard's own text and range from antiphons, hymns, and sequences, to responsories.&lt;ref&gt;Maddocks, Fiona. ''Hildegard of Bingen: The Woman of Her Age'' (New York: Doubleday, 2001), p. 194.&lt;/ref&gt; Her music is described as [[monophony|monophonic]], using soaring melodies that pushed the boundaries of the more traditional [[Gregorian chant]].

===Renaissance era===
[[Maddalena Casulana]] (1544–1590) was an Italian composer, [[lute]]nist and singer.&lt;ref&gt;Alternative names: Madalena Casulana di Mezarii, Madalena Casula.&lt;/ref&gt; Her first work dates from 1566: four madrigals in a collection, ''Il Desiderio'', which she produced in [[Florence]]. Two years later she published in [[Venice]] her first book of madrigals for four voices, ''Il primo libro di madrigali'', which is the first printed, published work by a woman in Western music history.&lt;ref name="Bridges"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oxfordmusiconline.com/view/10.1093/gmo/9781561592630.001.0001/omo-9781561592630-e-0000005155|title=Casulana [Mezari], Maddalena - Grove Music|website=Oxfordmusicinline.com|accessdate=7 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; She was close to [[Isabella de' Medici]] and dedicated some of her music to her. In 1570, 1583 and 1586 she published other books of madrigals. In the dedication to her first book of madrigals, she shows her feelings about being a female composer at a time when this was rare: "[I] want to show the world, as much as I can in this profession of music, the vain error of men that they alone possess the gifts of intellect and artistry, and that such gifts are never given to women." 
Her style is [[counterpoint|contrapuntal]] and [[chromatic scale|chromatic]] and her melodic lines are singable and attentive to the text. Other composers of the time, such as [[Philippe de Monte]], thought highly of her.

[[Caterina Assandra]] (1590–1618) was an Italian composer and [[Benedictine]] [[nun]]. She became famous as an organist and published various works.&lt;ref&gt;''Women Composers: Music Through the Ages.''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.earlywomenmasters.net/midi/mid/assand2.mid# |title=Archived copy |access-date=19 October 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303165459/http://www.earlywomenmasters.net/midi/mid/assand2.mid# |archive-date=3 March 2016 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Assandra composed a number of [[motet]]s and organ pieces. She studied [[counterpoint]] with Benedetto Re, one of the leading teachers at [[Pavia Cathedral]]. She composed a collection of [[motet]]s in the new [[concertato]] style in [[Milan]] in 1609, an imitative eight-voice ''[[Salve Regina]]'' in 1611, and a [[motet]], ''Audite verbum Dominum,'' for four voices in 1618. She composed traditional pieces and more innovative works. Among the latter is ''Duo seraphim.'' Her motet ''O Salutaris hodie,'' included in ''Motetti'' op. 2, was one of the first pieces to include the [[violone]], a bowed stringed instrument.

===Baroque era===
[[File:Orazio Gentileschi - Il suonatore di liuto (National Gallery of Art).jpg|thumb|left|200px|''The Lute Player'' by [[Orazio Gentileschi]], presumed to be a portrait of Francesca Caccini]]
[[Francesca Caccini]] (1587–1641) was an Italian composer, singer, [[lute]]nist, poet, and music teacher. Her singing for the wedding of [[Henry IV of France]] and [[Maria de Medici]] in 1600 was praised by Henry, who called her the "best singer in all of France". She worked in the [[Medici]] court as a teacher, chamber singer, rehearsal coach and composer of both chamber and stage music until 1627. By 1614 she was the court's most highly paid musician, because her musical [[virtuosity]] so well exemplified an idea of female excellence projected by Tuscany's de facto Regent, Granduchess [[Christina of Lorraine]]. Most of her stage music was composed for performance in comedies. In 1618 she published a collection of thirty-six solo songs and soprano/bass duets. In 1625 she composed a 75-minute "comedy-ballet". In all, she wrote sixteen staged works. She was a master of dramatic harmonic surprise: in her music it is harmony changes, more than counterpoint, that most powerfully communicates emotional affect.

[[Barbara Strozzi]] (1619–1677) was an Italian [[Baroque]] composer and singer. As a child, her considerable vocal talents were displayed to a wide audience. She was also compositionally gifted, and her father arranged for her to study with composer [[Francesco Cavalli]]. Strozzi was said to be "the most prolific composer – man or woman – of printed secular vocal music in Venice in the Middle of the century".{{sfn|Glixon|1999|p=135}} Her output is also unique in that it only contains secular vocal music, with the exception of one volume of sacred songs.{{sfn|Heller|2006}} She was renowned for her poetic ability as well as her compositional talent. Her lyrics were often poetic and well-articulated.{{sfn|Glixon|1999|p=138}} Nearly three-quarters of her printed works were written for [[soprano]], but she also published works for other voices.{{sfn|Kendrick|2002}} Her compositions are firmly rooted in the ''[[seconda pratica]]'' tradition. Strozzi's music evokes the spirit of [[Francesco Cavalli|Cavalli]], heir of [[Monteverdi]].  However, her style is more lyrical, and more dependent on sheer vocal sound.{{sfn|Rosand|1986|p=170}} Many of the texts for her early pieces were written by her father Giulio. Later texts were written by her father's colleagues, and for many compositions she may have written her own texts.

[[Élisabeth Jacquet de La Guerre]] (1665–1729) was a French composer, musician and [[harpsichordist]]. She was born into a family of musicians and master instrument-makers. A child prodigy, she performed on the [[harpsichord]] before King [[Louis XIV]].

[[Harriett Abrams]] (1758–1821) was an English composer and [[soprano]]. As a singer, she was praised for her performances of [[George Frideric Handel]]. She studied singing, [[music theory]], and [[Musical composition|composition]] with composer [[Thomas Arne]] before making her opera début in 1775 at the [[Theatre Royal, Drury Lane]] in London. Abrams became a principal singer at the fashionable London concerts and provincial festivals, appearing regularly from 1780–1790. Abrams composed several songs, two of which, "The Orphan's Prayer" and "Crazy Jane", became popular. She published two sets of Italian and English [[canzonet]]s, a collection of Scottish songs and glees harmonized for two and three voices, and more than a dozen songs, mainly sentimental [[ballad]]s. A collection of songs published in 1803 was dedicated by Harriett to [[Charlotte of Mecklenburg-Strelitz|Queen Charlotte]].&lt;ref name="Grove1"&gt;Olive Baldwin, Thelma Wilson: "Harriett Abrams", ''Grove Music Online'' ed.

[[Maria Teresa Agnesi]] (1720–1795) was an Italian composer.  Though she was most famous for her compositions, she was also an accomplished [[harpsichordist]] and singer. The majority of her surviving compositions were written for keyboard, the voice, or both. Her career was made possible by the Austrian Lombardy, which was progressive and enlightened in [[women's rights]]. Her patron was [[Maria Theresia]], holy Roman Empress and sovereign of Lombardy, and [[Maria Antonia Walpurgis]], a gifted composer and contemporary. Her early works are simple and clean, while her later works are more virtuosic, complex, and melodramatic. She composed operas, including heroic drama and serious drama styles. She also wrote arias, concertos and sonatas for keyboard, small ensemble and voice.

[[Princess Anna Amalia of Prussia|Princess Anna Amalia]] (1723–1787) was a Prussian composer and score curator. She learned to play the harpsichord, flute, and violin as a young woman. She became the Abbess of Quedlinburg in 1755.&lt;ref name="huberty"&gt;{{cite book | title=L'Allemagne Dynastique, Tome V -- Hohenzollern-Waldeck | publisher=Laballery |author1=Huberty, Michel |author2=Giraud, Alain |author3=Magdelaine, F. and B. | year=1989 | location=France | pages=162, 172| isbn=2-901138-05-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; She spent most of her time in Berlin, where she devoted herself to music, and became a musical patron and composer. As a composer she achieved a modest amount of fame and is most known for her smaller chamber works, which included trios, marches, cantatas, songs and fugues. In 1758, she studied musical theory and composition with [[Johann Kirnberger|Johann Philipp Kirnberger]], a student of [[Johann Sebastian Bach]]. She composed chamber music such as flute sonatas. More, she set the text of Ramler's [[Passion cantata]] ''Der Tod Jesu'' ("The Death of Jesus") to music. She was also a collector of music, preserving over 600 volumes of works by Johann Sebastian Bach, [[George Frideric Handel]], [[Georg Philipp Telemann]], [[Karl Heinrich Graun]] and [[Carl Philipp Emanuel Bach]], among others. Her works of [[curator|curation]] are a significant contribution to [[Western culture]].

[[Elisabeth Olin]] (1740–1828) was a Swedish opera singer and composer. She debuted as Alfhild in ''Syrinx'' referred to as Sweden's first native [[Opéra comique|Opera comique]], at ''[[Bollhuset]]'' in 1747. She became a famed vocalist in the regular public concerts at ''[[Riddarhuset]]'' in [[Stockholm]], and published her own compositions; she was one of the Swedish composers who wrote one composition each for the collection ''Gustaviade. En hjältedikt i tolv sånger'' ('Gustaviade.

[[Marianne von Martinez]] (1744–1812) was an Austrian composer, singer and pianist. [[Metastasio]] noticed her precocious talents and came to oversee her musical education, which included keyboard lessons from [[Haydn]], singing lessons with [[Porpora]] and composition lessons with [[Johann Adolph Hasse]] and the Imperial court composer [[Giuseppe Bonno]]. She was a native speaker of both Italian and German and knew French and English.&lt;ref&gt;Godt, 541&lt;/ref&gt; As a child, she played for the Imperial court, where she "attracted attention with her beautiful voice and her keyboard playing".&lt;ref&gt;Wessely, [[New Grove]], "Marianne von Martinez", online edition cited below&lt;/ref&gt; As an adult, she was frequently asked to perform before the Empress [[Maria Theresa]].&lt;ref&gt;Godt 1995, 538&lt;/ref&gt; A number of the works that Marianna composed are set for solo voice. She wrote a number of secular cantatas and two oratorios to Italian texts. Surviving compositions include four [[mass]]es, six [[motet]]s, and three litanies for choir. She wrote in the Italian style, as was typical for the early [[classical music era|Classical]] period in Vienna.  Her harpsichord performance practice was compared to the style of [[Carl Philipp Emanuel Bach|C.P.E. Bach]]. Her Italian oratorio ''Isacco figura del redentore'' was premiered by massive forces in 1782.&lt;ref&gt;Pohl (1856:60)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Romantic era===
[[File:Fanny Hensel 1842.jpg|thumb|right|Fanny Mendelssohn, 1842, by [[Moritz Daniel Oppenheim]]]]

[[Maria Szymanowska]] (1789–1831) was a well-known Polish composer and pianist. She wrote in many of the same genres as fellow Pole [[Frederic Chopin]] (1810–1849). Szymanowska maintained connections with several famous nineteenth-century people, including [[Gioacchino Rossini]], [[Johann Wolfgang von Goethe]], and [[Adam Mickiewicz]], Poland's greatest poet.

[[Fanny Mendelssohn]] (1805–1847) was one of the best-known women composers of the 1800s. She showed prodigious musical ability as a child and began to write music. Even though famous visitors to her family home were equally impressed by Fanny and her brother [[Felix Mendelssohn]], Fanny was limited by prevailing attitudes of the time toward women. Her father was tolerant, rather than supportive, of her activities as a composer. Her father wrote to her in 1820, telling her that "[m]usic will perhaps become his [i.e. Felix's] profession, while for ''you'' it can and must be only an ornament [in your life]".&lt;ref&gt;Letter of 16 July 1820, in Hensel (1884), I 82&lt;/ref&gt; Felix cautioned her against publishing her works under her own name and seeking a career in music. He wrote:
&lt;blockquote&gt;'From my knowledge of Fanny I should say that she has neither inclination nor vocation for [musical] authorship. She is too much all that a woman ought to be for this. She regulates her house, and neither thinks of the public nor of the musical world, nor even of music at all, until her first duties are fulfilled. Publishing would only disturb her in these, and I cannot say that I approve of it'.&lt;ref&gt;Letter to Lea Mendelssohn-Bartholdy,24 June 1837. Mendelssohn (1864), p. 113
&lt;/ref&gt;  &lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[Clara Schumann]] (1819–1896) was a German composer and concert pianist who had a 61-year concert career, which changed the format and repertoire of the piano recital and the tastes of the listening public. From an early age, she had a one-hour lesson in piano, violin, singing, theory, harmony, composition, and counterpoint. In 1830, at the age of eleven, she had become a virtuoso soloist and she left on a concert tour of European cities. In the late 1830s, she performed to sell-out crowds and laudatory critical reviews. [[Frédéric Chopin]] described her playing to [[Franz Liszt]], who came to hear one of her concerts and subsequently "praised her extravagantly" in a letter that was published in the Parisian ''Revue et Gazette Musicale''.&lt;ref name="Nancya250"&gt;Reich (1986), 250.&lt;/ref&gt; She was named a ''Königliche und Kaiserliche Kammervirtuosin'' ("Royal and Imperial Chamber Virtuoso"), [[Austria]]'s highest musical honor.&lt;ref name="Nancya250" /&gt;

She was also instrumental in changing the kind of programs expected of concert pianists. In her early career, before her marriage to [[Robert Schumann]], she played what was then customary, mainly bravura pieces designed to showcase the artist's technique, often in the form of arrangements or variations on popular themes from operas, written by virtuosos such as Thalberg, Herz, or Henselt. As it was also customary to play one's own compositions, she included at least one of her own works in every program, works such as her Variations on a Theme by Bellini (Op. 8) and her popular Scherzo (Op. 10). Her works include songs, piano pieces, a piano concerto, a [[piano trio]], choral pieces, and three Romances for violin and piano. &lt;!--Her husband however remarked that she did not have the opportunity to do this often, as a result of being a wife and a mother:

{{quote|'Clara has composed a series of small pieces, which show a musical and tender ingenuity such as she has never attained before. But to have children, and a husband who is always living in the realm of imagination, does not go together with composing. She cannot work at it regularly, and I am often disturbed to think how many profound ideas are lost because she cannot work them out'.}}{{cn|date=February 2018}}--&gt;

Women have a high prominence in many [[popular music]] styles as singers. However, professional women instrumentalists are uncommon in popular music, especially in rock genres such as [[heavy metal music|heavy metal]].

"The rebellion of rock music was largely a male rebellion; the women—often, in the 1950s and '60s, girls in their teens—in rock usually sang songs as personæ utterly dependent on their macho boyfriends...". Philip Auslander says that "Although there were many women in rock by the late 1960s, most performed only as singers, a traditionally feminine position in popular music". Though some women played instruments in American [[all-female bands|all-female garage rock bands]], none of these bands achieved more than regional success. So they "did not provide viable templates for women's on-going participation in rock".&lt;ref name="I Wanna Be Your Man"&gt;{{cite journal

====All-female bands and girl groups====
An [[all-female band]] is a musical group in [[popular music]] genres such as rock, [[blues]], [[jazz]] and related genres which is exclusively composed of [[female musician]]s. This is distinct from a [[girl group]], in which the female members are solely vocalists, though this terminology is not universally followed.&lt;ref&gt;For example, vocalists [[Girls Aloud]] are referred to as a "girl band" in [http://www.ok.co.uk/fashion/view/8555/Meet-the-duo-dressing-Girls-Aloud ''OK'' magazine] and the [https://www.theguardian.com/music/2008/nov/09/girlsaloud-thexfactor ''Guardian''], while [[Girlschool]] are termed a "girl group" at the [https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0320918/bio ''imdb''] and [http://www.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/entertainment/music/reviews/the-hedrons-13401497.html?startindex=-1 ''Belfast Telegraph''].&lt;/ref&gt; While all-male bands are common in many rock and pop bands, all-female bands are less common.

A [[girl group]] is a music act featuring several female singers who generally [[vocal harmony|harmonize]] together. The term "girl group" is also used in a narrower sense within English-speaking countries to denote the wave of American female [[pop music]] singing groups which flourished in the late [[1950s in music|1950s]] and early [[1960s in music|1960s]] between the [[Rock and roll#decline|decline of early rock and roll]] and the [[British Invasion]], many of whom were influenced by [[doo-wop]] style.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Rutledge |first=Meredith E. |url=http://rockhall.com/blog/post/6655_the-fabulous-girl-groups-women-who-rock/ |title=The Fabulous Girl Groups &amp;#124; The Rock and Roll Hall of Fame and Museum |publisher=Rockhall.com |date=2013-04-15 |accessdate=2014-06-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.history-of-rock.com/g_g-history.htm |title=Girl Groups - A Short History |publisher=History-of-rock.com |date= |accessdate=2014-06-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; All-female bands are sometimes also called girl groups.&lt;ref&gt;For example, vocalist groups [[Sugababes]] and [[Girls Aloud]] are referred to as "girl bands" [http://www.ok.co.uk/fashion/view/8555/Meet-the-duo-dressing-Girls-Aloud Meet the duo dressing Girls Aloud] ''OK'' magazine, 20 March 2009; [https://www.theguardian.com/music/2008/nov/09/girlsaloud-thexfactor The nation's new sweetheart] ''The Observer'', 9 November 2008; while instrumentalists [[Girlschool]] are termed a "[[girl group]]" [https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0320918/bio Biography for Girlschool] Internet Movie Database; [http://www.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/entertainment/music/reviews/the-hedrons-13401497.html?startindex=-1 The Hedrons] ''Belfast Telegraph'', 19 January 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

====1930s-1960s====
In the [[Jazz Age]] and during the 1930s, all-female bands such as The Blue Belles, the Parisian Redheads (later the Bricktops), Lil-Hardin's All-Girl Band, [[The Ingenues]], The Harlem Playgirls, Phil Spitalny's Musical Sweethearts and "Helen Lewis and Her All-Girl Jazz Syncopators" were popular.[[Ina Ray Hutton]] led an all-girl band, the [[Melodears]], from 1934 to 1939.  Eunice Westmoreland, under the name [[Rita Rio]], led an all-female band appearing on [[NBC Radio]] and for [[Vitaphone]] and [[RKO]]. A Polish group [[Filipinki]] was established in 1959.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://szczecin.gazeta.pl/szczecin/1,34959,14873014,Filipinki__W_USA_przecieraly_szlaki__w_ZSRR_czerwone.html?as=2 |title=Wyborcza.pl |publisher=Szczecin.gazeta.pl |date=1980-01-01 |accessdate=2016-01-20 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141217153333/http://szczecin.gazeta.pl/szczecin/1,34959,14873014,Filipinki__W_USA_przecieraly_szlaki__w_ZSRR_czerwone.html?as=2# |archive-date=17 December 2014 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Groups composed solely of women began to emerge with the advent of [[rock and roll]]. Among the earliest all-female rock bands to be signed to a record label were [[Goldie &amp; the Gingerbreads]], to [[Atlantic Records]] in 1964, [[The Pleasure Seekers/Cradle|The Pleasure Seekers]] with [[Suzi Quatro]] to Hideout Records in 1964 and [[Mercury Records]] in 1968, [[The Feminine Complex]] to Athena Records in 1968, and [[Fanny (band)|Fanny]] (who pioneered the all-female band sound in the early to mid-1970s) in 1969 when [[Mo Ostin]] signed them to [[Warner Bros. Records]].  There were also others, such as [[The Liverbirds]] (1962–1967), [[the Ace of Cups]] (1967), [[The Heart Beats]] (1968), and Ariel (1968–1970).

====1970s-1980s====
In 1971 [[Fanny (band)|Fanny]] became the first all-female band to reach the Hot 100's top 40, with "Charity Ball" peaking at No. 40. In 1975, the Canadian duo of sisters, [[Kate and Anna McGarrigle]], recorded the first of a string of albums. [[The Runaways]] were an early commercially successful, hard-edged, all-female hard rock band, releasing their first album in 1976: band members [[Joan Jett]], [[Cherie Currie]] and [[Lita Ford]] all went on to solo careers. The 1980s, for the first time, saw long-sought chart success from all-female bands and female-fronted rock bands.  On the Billboard Hot 100-year-end chart for 1982&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.billboard.com/bbcom/charts/yearend_chart_display.jsp?f=The+Billboard+Hot+100&amp;g=Year-end+Singles&amp;year=1982 "The Billboard Hot 100 1982"], ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]''. Retrieved 30 October 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Joan Jett]]'s ''[[I Love Rock 'n' Roll]]'' at No. 3 and [[the Go-Go's]] ''[[We Got the Beat]]'' at No. 25 sent a message out to many industry heads that females who could play could bring in money.

[[File:Viv Albertine.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Punk guitarist [[Viv Albertine]].]]
In the United Kingdom, the advent of [[Punk rock|punk]] in the late 1970s with its "anyone can do it" ethos led to women making significant contributions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Coon|first1=Caroline|title=1988: The New Wave Punk Rock Explosion|date=1977|publisher=Omnibus/Hawthorne Books|location=London|isbn=978-0801561290}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Berman|first1=Judy|title=15 Essential Women Punk Rock Icons|url=http://flavorwire.com/199630/15-essential-women-punk-icons|website=Flavorwire|accessdate=25 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast to the [[rock music]] and [[heavy metal music|heavy metal]] scenes of the 1970s, which were dominated by men, the anarchic, counter-cultural mindset of the punk scene in mid- and late 1970s encouraged women to participate. "That was the beauty of the punk thing," [[Chrissie Hynde]] later said." [Sexual] discrimination didn't exist in that scene."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Women of Punk and Post-Punk Music|url=http://www.biography.com/people/groups/women-of-punk-and-post-punk-music|website=Biography.com|accessdate=26 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; This participation played a role in the historical development of punk music, especially in the U.S. and U.K. at that time, and continues to influence and enable future generations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Why Women in Punk?|url=http://www.punk77.co.uk/groups/whywomeninpunk.htm|website=Women in Punk|publisher=Punk77.co.uk|accessdate=26 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Rock historian Helen Reddington states that the popular image of young punk women musicians as focused on the fashion aspects of the scene (fishnet stockings, spiky blond hair, etc.) was stereotypical. She states that many, if not most women punks were more interested in the ideology and socio-political implications, rather than the fashion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Reddington|first1=Helen|title=The Lost Women of Rock Music: Female Musicians of the Punk Era|date=2012|publisher=Ashgate/Equinox Publishing|isbn=978-1845539573|url=http://www.ashgate.com/default.aspx?page=637&amp;calcTitle=1&amp;isbn=9780754657736&amp;lang=cy-GB|accessdate=26 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Woronzoff|first1=Elizabeth|title=The Lost Women of Rock Music' Is an Important Work, But a Replay of the Same Old Themes|url=http://www.popmatters.com/review/161962-the-lost-women-of-rock-music...-by-helen-reddington/|website=Pop Matters|accessdate=26 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Music historian Caroline Coon contends that before punk, women in rock music were virtually invisible; in contrast, in punk, she argues "[i]t would be possible to write the whole history of punk music without mentioning any male bands at all -- and I think a lot of [people] would find that very surprising."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Conference proceedings (September 2001)|title=No Future?|accessdate=26 November 2015|publisher=University of Wolverhampton}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Reddington|first1=Helen|title=Introduction: The Lost Women of Rock Music|date=1977|publisher=Ashgate|location=London|isbn=9780754657736|url=http://www.ashgate.com/pdf/SamplePages/Lost_Women_of_Rock_Music_Intro.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Johnny Rotten]] wrote that "During the Pistols era, women were out there playing with the men, taking us on in equal terms ... It wasn't combative, but compatible."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Lydon|first1=John|title=Rotten: No Irish, No Blacks, No Dogs|date=1995|publisher=Coronet|location=London|isbn=978-0312428136|page=378}}&lt;/ref&gt; Women were involved in bands such as [[The Slits]], [[The Raincoats]], [[Mo-dettes]], and [[Dolly Mixture (band)|Dolly Mixture]], [[The Innocents (UK punk band)|The Innocents]].

Others take issue with the notion of equal recognition, such as guitarist [[Viv Albertine]], who stated that "the A&amp;R men, the bouncers, the sound mixers, no one took us seriously.. So, no, we got no respect anywhere we went. People just didn't want us around."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Petridis|first1=Alexis|title=The Slits' Viv Albertine on punk, violence and doomed domesticity|url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2014/jun/01/the-slits-viv-albertine-punk-violence-domesticity|publisher=The Guardian|accessdate=27 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Andrews|first1=Charlotte Richardson|title=Punk has a problem with women.

[[Sonic Youth]]'s [[Kim Gordon]] states, "I think women are natural anarchists, because you're always operating in a male framework."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Hall|first1=Rock|title=Women Who Rock: 10 Essential Punk Songs|url=http://rockhall.com/blog/post/7234_women-who-rock--10-essential-punk-songs/|publisher=The Rock &amp; Roll Hall of Fame Museum|accessdate=27 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=====Heavy metal=====
[[File:Girlschool live 2009-2.jpg|thumb|right|240px|[[Girlschool]] is a British all-women [[heavy metal music|heavy metal]] band formed in the [[new wave of British heavy metal]] scene in 1978 and frequently associated with contemporaries [[Motörhead]].

The all-female [[heavy metal music|heavy metal]] band [[Girlschool]], from South London, formed in 1978 out of the ashes of Painted Lady. While somewhat successful in the UK, they became better known in the early 1980s. One of the original members of the band, [[Kathy Valentine]] departed to join the all-female band [[The Go-Go's]], switching from guitar to bass. Among Girlschool's early recordings was an EP titled "The St. Valentines Day Massacre" which they recorded with Bronze label-mates [[Motörhead]] under the name [[Headgirl]]. In 1974, The Deadly Nightshade, a rock/country band, was signed by Phantom. Women in the heavy metal genre tend to have to limit themselves due to the genre being very male orientated.&lt;ref&gt;Hill, R.L. (2016). 'Power has a penis': Cost reduction, social exchange and sexism in metal--reviewing the work of Sonia Vasan. Metal music studies, 2(3), 263-272.&lt;/ref&gt;

=====Grunge=====
While there is a perception that the groups in the 1980s and 1990s [[alternative rock]] genre of [[grunge]] were "overwhelmingly male" (e.g., [[Nirvana (band)|Nirvana]]), "[w]omen were totally represented" in grunge bands such as [[L7 (band)|L7]], [[Lunachicks]], [[Dickless]], STP, [[7 Year Bitch]], [[Courtney Love]]'s group [[Hole (band)|Hole]] and [[Babes in Toyland (band)|Babes in Toyland]], the latter an "[[All female band|all-female Minneapolis band]]", and grunge was "inextricably linked with [[Riot Grrrl]]", an underground [[feminist]] [[punk rock|punk]] movement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2011/aug/24/grunge-myths-nirvana-kurt-cobain|title=Ten myths about grunge, Nirvana and Kurt Cobain |last=True |first=Everett |date= 24 August 2011|publisher=The Guardian |access-date=29 January 2017 |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Notable women instrumentalists include the bassists [[D'arcy Wretzky]] and [[Melissa Auf der Maur]] from [[The Smashing Pumpkins]] and drummers [[Patty Schemel]] ([[Hole (band)|Hole]] and Courtney Love projects) and [[Lori Barbero]] of [[Babes in Toyland (band)|Babes in Toyland]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://90srock.about.com/od/top-picks/tp/The-Greatest-Drummers-of-the-90s.htm|title=The 10 Greatest Drummers of the '90s|website=90srockmusic.com|accessdate=7 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====1990s-2000s====
In the 1990s, musician's magazines were starting to view female musicians more seriously, putting [[Bonnie Raitt]]&lt;ref&gt;Bonnie Raitt cover story, ''Guitar Player Magazine'', May 1977&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bonnie Raitt cover story, ''Guitar Player Magazine'', July 1998&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Tina Weymouth]]&lt;ref&gt;"Tina Weymouth &amp; David Byrne, The Talking Heads" (cover story), ''Guitar Player Magazine'', March 1984&lt;/ref&gt; on their covers. While The Go-Go's and [[The Bangles]], both from the LA club scene, were the first all-female rock bands to find sustained success, individual musicians paved the way for the industry to seek out bands that had female musicians.

In the 1990s, bands such as [[Hole (band)|Hole]], [[Super Heroines]], The Lovedolls and [[L7 (band)|L7]] became popular, while demonstrating on stage, and in interviews, a self-confident and  "bad" attitude at times, always willing to challenge assumptions about how an all-female band should behave. [[Courtney Love]] described the other females in [[Hole (band)|Hole]] as using a more "lunar viewpoint" in their roles as musicians.&lt;ref&gt;Boder, Christopher. "The Hole Story", ''Buzz'', Page 13, Vol VII, Issue 70. October 1991. "Most women in rock are only repeating what men have done. The women in this band are not doing that. We're coming at things from a more feminine, lunar, viewpoint."&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1990s, the punk, female-led [[Riot Grrrl]] genre was associated with bands such as [[Bratmobile]] and [[Bikini Kill]].

====2000s-2010s====
In the 2000s, all female and female fronted bands started using their influence to promote feminism and females in the music industry. Bands like The Distillers, fronted by Brody Dalle, influenced the rise of street punk. St. Vincent started gaining more traction and eventually appeared on the cover of Guitar World magazine. St. Vincent wore a T-shirt with a bikini decal on the magazine cover, a comment on how when women appear with guitars, they're usually dressed very minimally, as a marketing tool to sell the instruments. Haim, a band composed of three sisters, is extremely outspoken when it comes to the promotion of women in music, calling out major music festivals for the lack of female-fronted bands on bills and the lack of payment for female artists as compared to male artists of the same level.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.digitalmusicnews.com/2018/06/13/haim-festival-inequality/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.theguardian.com/inequality/2017/oct/12/tonights-live-music-acts-will-mostly-be-male-only-whats-holding-women-back&lt;/ref&gt; In recent years, the lack of female representation in music has been a major controversial point in the industry. Female musicians and bands are constantly overlooked in favor of male artists, however many people in the music industry have been making an effort to change this.

===Jazz===
[[File:Mary Lou Williams (Gottlieb 09231) - Crop.jpg|thumb|right|200px|[[Mary Lou Williams]] (1910–1981) was a pianist, composer and arranger who played [[jazz]], classical and [[Gospel music|gospel]] music. She wrote hundreds of compositions and arrangements and recorded more than one hundred records.]]
Historically, the majority of well-known [[Women in jazz|women performers in jazz]] have been singers, such as [[Ella Fitzgerald]], [[Billie Holiday]], [[Diane Schuur]] and [[Dinah Washington]]. ''Culture Trip'' notes that women in jazz have been "too often confined to the role of chanteuse."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Rasch|first1=Mirac|title=The Top 10 Female Jazz Musicians You Should Know|url=https://theculturetrip.com/north-america/usa/articles/the-top-10-female-jazz-musicians-you-should-know/|accessdate=3 April 2016|publisher=Culture Trip|date=13 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, there are many notable instrumental performers. In some cases, these musicians are also composers and bandleaders:
* [[Toshiko Akiyoshi]] (b. 1929): bandleader, pianist, arranger, composer
* [[Regina Carter]]: [[jazz violin]]
* [[Melba Liston]]: trombonist and arranger
* [[Vi Redd]] (b. 1928): alto saxophonist 
* [[Melissa Aldana]]: tenor saxophonist 
* [[Emily Remler]]: jazz guitar
* [[Mimi Fox]]: jazz guitar
*[[Sweet Emma Barrett]]
*[[Terri Lyne Carrington]] (drums)
*[[Carla Bley]] (piano)
*[[Mary Lou Williams]] (piano)
*[[Billie Pierce]] (piano)
*[[Jeanette Kimball]] (piano)
*[[Lovie Austin]] (piano and bandleader)
*[[Joelle Khoury]] (piano and composer)

There have also been [[all-female band|all-female jazz bands]] such as [[The International Sweethearts of Rhythm]].

===Classical music===
Instrumentalists in classical music may focus on one specific type of playing, such as solo recitals, solo concertos, [[chamber music]], or performing as a member of an orchestra, or they may do different types. Some musicians who play orchestral instruments may do all of these types of performances. Instrumentalists in classical music may do both live performances for an audience and recordings. In some cases, classical performers may do mostly live performances. There has traditionally been a gendered aspect to playing instruments in classical music.

Many album covers for female classical musicians have photographs that emphasize the physical attractiveness of the performer, "often using risqué images".&lt;ref&gt;Mary Zeiss Stange, Carol K. Oyster, Jane E. Sloan. ''Encyclopedia of Women in Today's World'', Volume 1. SAGE Publications, 2011. p. 294&lt;/ref&gt; According to Jessica Duchen, a music writer for London's ''[[The Independent]]'', Classical women musicians are "too often judged for their appearances, rather than their talent" and they face pressure "to look sexy onstage and in photos."&lt;ref name="music.cbc.ca"/&gt; Duchen states that while "[t]here are women musicians who refuse to play on their looks,...the ones who do tend to be more materially successful."&lt;ref name="music.cbc.ca"/&gt;

====Orchestra====
[[File:Music. Montreal Women's Symphony Orchestra BAnQ Vieux-Montréal P48S1P08057.jpg|thumb|right|200px|The Montreal Women's Symphony Orchestra in 1942]]
Historically, orchestras tended to be almost exclusively male, with the exception of the harp player, as the harp was considered a "women's instrument". A music newspaper editorial in 1917 in England encouraged orchestras to allow women to play the "lighter instruments", with the understanding that these women performers would relinquish their positions to men once WW I was over.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; In the 1990s, to reduce the likelihood of [[gender bias]], some orchestras began conducting [[audition]]s of potential new members behind a screen, so the audition panel could not see if it was a male or female performer. Historically, there has been a tendency for brass sections to be male, and some women brass players have alleged that there is gender bias against female brass players. A study in the 1980s found that women made up 36% of US orchestras; 30% in the United Kingdom, and 16% in East and West Germany.&lt;ref name="osborne-conant.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.osborne-conant.org/excuse.htm |title=Gender Bias In International Orchestras |publisher=Osborne-conant.org |date= |accessdate=2016-01-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Women tended to be hired by lower paid orchestras and they were less present in major orchestras.&lt;ref name="osborne-conant.org"/&gt;

In the past, the [[Vienna Philharmonic Orchestra]] argued that "ethnic and gender uniformity" gave their orchestra a better sound.&lt;ref name="osborne-conant.org"/&gt; Several male VPO musicians stated in a 1996 interview that classical music has "gender-defined qualities which can be most clearly expressed by male uniformity" in the orchestra.&lt;ref name="osborne-conant.org"/&gt; One male VPO member stated that men "carry secrets that are involved with music and tones, just like in Australian aboriginal or Indian cultures where men play certain instruments, and not the women."&lt;ref name="osborne-conant.org"/&gt; One male VPO performer stated that "pregnancy brings problems.  It brings disorder.  Another important argument against women is that they can bring the solidarity of the men in question. You find that in all men's groups."

The Vienna Philharmonic did not accept women to permanent membership until 1997, far later than comparable orchestras (of the other orchestras ranked among the world's top five by [[Gramophone (magazine)|Gramophone]] in 2008,&lt;ref name="The world's greatest orchestras"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gramophone.co.uk/editorial/the-world%E2%80%99s-greatest-orchestras |title=The world's greatest orchestras |work=gramophone.co.uk |date= |accessdate=2013-04-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; the last to appoint a woman to a permanent position was the [[Berlin Philharmonic]].&lt;ref&gt;[[James R. Oestreich]], [http://artsbeat.blogs.nytimes.com/2007/11/16/berlin-in-lights-the-woman-question/ "Berlin in Lights: The Woman Question"], Arts Beat, ''The New York Times'', 16 November 2007&lt;/ref&gt;) As late as February 1996, first flautist Dieter Flury told [[Westdeutscher Rundfunk]] that accepting women would be "gambling with the emotional unity ({{Lang|de|emotionelle Geschlossenheit}}) that this organism currently has".&lt;ref name=WDR5&gt;Westdeutscher Rundfunk Radio 5, "Musikalische Misogynie", 13 February 1996, [http://www.osborne-conant.org/wdrgerm.htm transcribed by Regina Himmelbauer]; [http://www.osborne-conant.org/wdr.htm translation by William Osborne]&lt;/ref&gt; In April 1996, the orchestra's press secretary wrote that "compensating for the expected leaves of absence" of [[maternity leave]] was a problem.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.osborne-conant.org/posts/schuster.htm |title=The Vienna Philharmonic's Letter of Response to the Gen-Mus List |work=Osborne-conant.org |date=25 February 1996 |accessdate=2013-10-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Sarah Chang before performing.jpg|thumb|right|140px|Classical violinist [[Sarah Chang]] before performing a 2005 solo concert]]

In 1997, the orchestra was "facing protests during a [US] tour" by the [[National Organization for Women]] and International Association of Women in Music. Finally, "after being held up to increasing ridicule even in socially conservative Austria, members of the orchestra gathered [on 28 February 1997] in an extraordinary meeting on the eve of their departure and agreed to admit a woman, Anna Lelkes, as harpist."&lt;ref name=JP&gt;Jane Perlez, [https://www.nytimes.com/1997/02/28/world/vienna-philharmonic-lets-women-join-in-harmony.html "Vienna Philharmonic Lets Women Join in Harmony"], ''The New York Times'', 28 February 1997&lt;/ref&gt; As of 2013, the orchestra has six female members; one of them, violinist Albena Danailova became one of the orchestra's [[concertmaster]]s in 2008, the first woman to hold that position.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = https://www.france24.com/en/20080508-vienna-opera-appoints-first-ever-female-concertmaster-opera-austria |title = Vienna opera appoints first ever female concertmaster|work = [[France 24]]|date = 8 May 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2012, women still made up just 6% of the orchestra's membership, compared to 14% in the Berlin Philharmonic, 30% in the [[London Symphony Orchestra]], and 36% in the [[New York Philharmonic]]. VPO president Clemens Hellsberg said the VPO now uses completely screened [[blind audition]]s. She said it chooses "the best we get," implying that full gender equity would take time as older members retire and new ones audition under gender-neutral conditions.&lt;ref name=Legends&gt;James R. Oestrich, [https://www.nytimes.com/1998/02/28/arts/even-legends-adjust-to-time-and-trend-even-the-vienna.html "Even Legends Adjust To Time and Trend, Even the Vienna Philharmonic"], ''The New York Times'', 28 February 1998&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Czech Philharmonic]] excludes women and the [[Berlin Philharmonic]] "has a history of gender discrimination."&lt;ref name="osborne-conant.org"/&gt;

In 2013, an article in ''Mother Jones'' stated that "[m]any prestigious orchestras have significant female membership—women outnumber men in the [[New York Philharmonic]]'s violin section—and several renowned ensembles, including the [[National Symphony Orchestra]], the [[Detroit Symphony]], and the Minnesota Symphony, are led by women violinists. Brass, percussion, and [[Double bass|string-bass]] orchestra sections are still predominantly male."&lt;ref name="motherjones.com"&gt;{{cite web|first=Hannah|last=Levintova |url=https://www.motherjones.com/media/2013/09/women-conductors-gap-charts-marin-alsop-proms |title=Here's Why You Seldom See Women Leading a Symphony |publisher=Mother Jones |date= |accessdate=2016-01-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Soloists====
In classical music, soloists may perform unaccompanied solos on their instrument, as occurs with pianists who play works for solo piano or stringed instruments who play Baroque suites for one instrument (e.g., [[Bach suites for solo cello]]). In many cases, though, soloists are accompanied, either by a pianist, a small [[chamber music]] ensemble, or, in the case of a concerto, by a full symphony orchestra. In the 2014–2015 season, the majority of concerto soloists who performed with major Canadian orchestras were male. In the [[Vancouver Symphony Orchestra]], 67% of the concerto soloists were male. In the [[Toronto Symphony Orchestra]], 74% of the concerto soloists were male. In the [[National Arts Centre Orchestra]], 79% of the concerto soloists were male. In the [[Orchestre Symphonique de Montreal]], 84% of the concerto soloists were male.&lt;ref name="music.cbc.ca"/&gt; When the CBC news story on the gender balance of concerto soloists was released, the conductor of the Vancouver Symphony Orchestra, [[Bramwell Tovey]], disputed the accuracy of the news story in regards to his orchestra, arguing that the article only took a single season into account.

==Singers==

===Popular music===
[[File:Madonna Rebel Heart Tour 2015 - Amsterdam 2 (23823323680).jpg|thumb|left|200px|[[Madonna (entertainer)|Madonna]] is often referred to as the artist who changed the role of women in popular music.]]

Singers in popular music perform the vocals for bands and other music groups, which may range in size from a [[Musical duo|duo]] or a [[power trio]] to a large jazz [[big band]]. Singers typically do both live performances and studio recordings. Singers who do live performances may sing in small venues such as [[coffeehouse]]s or [[nightclub]]s, or they may perform in larger venues ranging from arts centres to stadiums. Some singers also perform in music videos, which are used to promote the songs. In some styles of music, singers may play a [[rhythm section]] instrument, such as rhythm guitar, electric bass or a percussion instrument while they sing. In some styles of pop, singers perform choreographed dance moves during the show. Two well-known examples of pop singers who perform elaborate dance routines in their live shows are [[Madonna (singer)|Madonna]] and [[Britney Spears]].

Singer-songwriter and music producer [[Bjork]] has commented on how "women's labor and expertise—inside and outside of the music industry—go unnoticed." She has stated that "[I]t's invisible, what women do," and "[I]t's not rewarded as much."&lt;ref name="newyorker.com"/&gt; Bjork states "that her male collaborators are typically credited for the sound of her records; because on stage she mainly sings, there is a widespread assumption that she neither produces [as a music producer] nor plays an instrument."&lt;ref name="newyorker.com"/&gt; In 2015, "while accepting the Woman of the Year honor at this year's Billboard Women in Music event", [[Lady Gaga]] commented on the "difficulties of being a female recording artist." She said it "is really hard sometimes for women in music. It's like a f[uck]ing boys club that we just can't get in to." She stated that she "tried for so long... to be taken seriously as a musician for my intelligence more than my body", yet she felt that others in the industry did not believe that women could have a "musical background... [or] understand what you're doing because you're a female."&lt;ref name="people.com"/&gt; A [[University Press of Kentucky]] book  states that customers did not treat a woman who worked at a guitar store like she knew anything about guitars until she would use special guitar terms.&lt;ref name="auto1"&gt;Carson, Mina; Lewis, Tina; Shaw, Susan M. ''Girls Rock! Fifty Years of Women Making Music''. University Press of Kentucky. p. 19&lt;/ref&gt; Indie folk singer-songwriter/guitarist [[Ani di Franco]] states that for women, in the past, even entering a guitar store was an "act of courage" because it felt like a "boys' club".&lt;ref name="auto1"/&gt; Not only do female artists feel the pressure to please their male counterparts but it is also difficult for female DJs to fit in, in a male-dominated field&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://ricochet.media/en/48/DJs-tackle-gender-bias|title=Female DJs tackle gender bias {{!}} Ricochet|work=Ricochet|access-date=2017-12-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Chaka Khan in Chris March 01.jpg|thumb|right|180 px |[[Chaka Khan]] (born 1953) has been called the "Queen of Funk."]]
Despite [[funk]]'s popularity in modern music, few people have examined the work of funk women. As cultural critic Cheryl Keyes explains in her essay "She Was too Black for Rock and too hard for Soul: (Re)discovering the Musical Career of Betty Mabry Davis," most of the scholarship around funk has focused on the cultural work of men. She states that "[[Betty Davis]] is an artist whose name has gone unheralded as a pioneer in the annals of funk and rock. Most writing on these musical genres has traditionally placed male artist like Jimi Hendrix, George Clinton (of Parliament-Funkadelic), and bassist Larry Graham as trendsetters in the shaping of a rock music sensibility"&lt;ref&gt;Cheryl Keyes, "She Was too Black for Rock and too hard for Soul: (Re)discovering the Musical Career of Betty Mabry Davis" 35.&lt;/ref&gt; (35). Notable funk women include [[Chaka Khan]], [[Labelle]], [[Brides of Funkenstein]], [[Klymaxx]], [[Mother's Finest]], and [[Betty Davis]].

Below are some of the top-earning female singers in the [[2010s in music|2010s]]. Another way of selecting the most notable singers for this section would be by [[Music criticism|critical acclaim]], but this is a more subjective criteria than earnings.

[[Classic female blues]] was an early form of [[blues music]] popular in the 1920s. An amalgam of traditional folk blues and urban theater music, the style is also known as vaudeville blues.  Classic blues songs performed by female vocalists were accompanied by pianists or small jazz ensembles, and were the first blues to be recorded. The classic female blues singers were pioneers in the [[record industry]], as they were among the first black singers and blues artists who were recorded. They were also instrumental in popularizing the [[12-bar blues]] throughout the US.

[[Ma Rainey|Gertrude "Ma" Rainey]] (1886–1939), known as the "[[List of people known as the father or mother of something|Mother of]] the Blues", is credited as the first to perform the blues on stage as popular entertainment when she began incorporating blues into her act of show songs and [[comedy]] around 1902.&lt;ref&gt;Stewart-Baxter, Derrick. ''Ma Rainey and the Classic Blues Singers''. New York: Stein &amp; Day Publishers, 1970. p. 38&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Harrison, Daphne Duval. ''Black Pearls: Blues Queens of the '20s''. New Brunswick: Rutgers University Press, 1988. p. 34&lt;/ref&gt; New York-based cabaret singer [[Mamie Smith]] recorded "Crazy Blues" in 1920, which sold over 75,000 copies.&lt;ref&gt;Stewart-Baxter, Derrick. ''Ma Rainey and the Classic Blues Singers''. New York: Stein &amp; Day Publishers, 1970.&lt;/ref&gt; Smith became known as "America's First Lady of the Blues". In 1920, the vaudeville singer [[Lucille Hegamin]] became the second black woman to record blues when she recorded "The Jazz Me Blues".&lt;ref&gt;Stewart-Baxter, Derrick. ''Ma Rainey and the Classic Blues Singers''. New York: Stein &amp; Day Publishers, 1970. p. 16.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ethel Waters]], [[Alberta Hunter]], [[Mary Stafford (singer)|Mary Stafford]], [[Katie Crippen]], [[Edith Wilson (singer)|Edith Wilson]], and [[Esther Bigeou]], among others, made their first recordings before the end of 1921.&lt;ref&gt;Harris, Sheldon. ''Blues Who's Who'' (Revised Ed.). New York: Da Capo Press, 1994. pp. 48, 137, 254, 484, 540, 580.&lt;/ref&gt; These blues recordings were typically labeled as "[[race records]]" to distinguish them from records sold to white audiences. Nonetheless, the recordings of some of the classic female blues singers were purchased by white buyers as well.&lt;ref&gt;Steinberg, Jesse R., and Abrol Fairweather. ''Blues: Thinking Deep about Feeling Low''. Hoboken, N.J. Wiley; Chichester: John Wiley [distributor], 2011, p. 159&lt;/ref&gt; [[Marion Harris]] became one of the first white female singers to record the blues.

The most popular of the classic blues singers was [[Tennessee]]-born [[Bessie Smith]] (no relation to Mamie Smith), who first recorded in 1923 and became known as the "Empress of the Blues". She signed with [[Columbia Records|Columbia]] and became the highest-paid black artist of the 1920s, recording over 160 songs. Other classic blues singers who recorded extensively until the end of the 1920s were [[Ida Cox]], [[Clara Smith]], and [[Sara Martin]]. These early blues singers were an influence on later singers such as [[Mahalia Jackson]] and [[Janis Joplin]]. These blues women's contributions to the genre included "increased improvisation on melodic lines, unusual phrasing which altered the emphasis and impact of the lyrics, and vocal dramatics using shouts, groans, moans, and wails. The blues women thus effected changes in other types of popular singing that had spin-offs in jazz, [[Broadway musical]]s, [[torch song]]s of the 1930s and 1940s, [[gospel music|gospel]], [[rhythm and blues]], and eventually [[rock and roll]]."&lt;ref&gt;Harrison, Daphne Duval. ''Black Pearls: Blues Queens of the '20s''. New Brunswick: Rutgers University Press, 1988. p. 8&lt;/ref&gt;

===Country music ===
Gender discrimination and sexism occurs frequently in [[country music]]. In more recent times, a popular subgenre has developed: "Bro-Country", which has lyrics that sexually objectify women and frame them as assets for men's use. Some popular "Bro-Country" artists include [[Luke Bryan]], [[Florida Georgia Line]], and [[Blake Shelton]]. Gender discrimination and sexism has become more prominent in this genre over time. Dr. Eric Rasumssen, a professor in the College of Media and Communication and Texas Tech University, argues that compared to the 1990s and 2000s (decade), the country music of the 2010s discriminates more against women. Some of the ways they discriminate include, "talking more about women’s appearance, [showing] women in tight or revealing clothing, comparing women to objects, referring to women in slang [terms] versus their real names, and portraying women as distrustful and cheaters."

"Bro-Country" may be influenced by historical aspects of Southern culture which have been associated with racism and sexism. Women in country music continue to face these issues. [[Kacey Musgraves]], a recording artist, describes her experience with sexism in country music by stating that if a label can't get your song off the ground, it's immediately blamed on your personality or the fact that you're female, or that you didn't make a radio station program director feel important.

===Jazz===

While woman have been underrepresented in jazz as instrumentalists, composers, songwriters and bandleaders, there have been many notable women singers. [[Bessie Smith]] sang both the blues and jazz. [[Lena Horne]] first appeared in the [[Cotton Club]] as a teenager. [[Ella Fitzgerald]] and [[Billie Holiday]] were known for their ballads during the swing era. [[Shirley Horn]] sang both jazz and blues. [[Nina Simone]] sang jazz, folk and Rhythm and blues. [[Etta Jones]] sang rhythm and blues and jazz. [[Anita O'Day]] is known for her contributions to Bebop. [[Betty Carter]] sang during the post-bop era. [[Mary Lou Williams]] was a singer and pianist during the swing and hard bop eras. [[Sarah Vaughan]] is known for her singing in the  Cool jazz era. Other notable singers include [[Rosemary Clooney]], [[Diane Schuur]] and [[Flora Purim]]. Contemporary jazz singers include [[Norah Jones]], [[Diana Krall]], [[Melody Gardot]] and singer-bassist [[Esperanza Spalding]].

Classical singers typically do both live performances and recordings. Live performances may be in small venues, such as churches, or large venues, such as opera halls or arts centers. Classical singers may specialize in specific types of singing, such as [[art song]], which are songs performed with piano accompaniment, or opera, which is singing accompanied by a [[symphony orchestra]] in a staged, costumed theatrical production.  Classical singers are typically categorized by their voice type, which indicates both their vocal range and in some cases also the "color" of their voice. Examples of voice types that indicate the range of a singer's voice include [[contralto]], [[mezzo-soprano]] and [[soprano]] (these go from the lowest range to the highest range). Examples of voice types that indicate both the singer's range and the "color" of her voice type are [[coloratura soprano]] and [[lyric soprano]]. Whereas popular music singers typically use a [[microphone]] and a [[sound reinforcement system]] for their vocals, in classical music the voice must be projected into the hall naturally, a skill for which they undertake vocal training.

L. Macy (Accessed 9 February 2009), [http://www.grovemusic.com (subscription access)]&lt;/ref&gt; Most of her singing career was spent performing in concert and recital in major music venues and with famous orchestras throughout the United States and Europe between 1925 and 1965. Anderson became an important figure in the struggle for black artists to overcome racial prejudice in the United States during the mid-twentieth century. In 1939, the [[Daughters of the American Revolution]] (DAR) refused permission for Anderson to sing to an integrated audience in [[DAR Constitution Hall|Constitution Hall]]. With the aid of First Lady [[Eleanor Roosevelt]] and her husband [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]], Anderson performed a critically acclaimed open-air concert on Easter Sunday, 9 April 1939, on the steps of the [[Lincoln Memorial]] in Washington, D.C. She sang before a crowd of more than 75,000 people and a radio audience in the millions. Anderson continued to break barriers for black artists in the United States, becoming the first black person, American or otherwise, to perform at the [[Metropolitan Opera]] in New York City on 7 January 1955.

Women play an important role in [[world music]], a musical category encompassing many different styles of music from around the world, including [[ethnic music]] and [[traditional music]] from Africa, the Caribbean, South America, Asia, and other regions, indigenous music, neotraditional music, and music where more than one cultural tradition intermingle (e.g., mixtures of Western pop and ethnic music). The term was popularized in the 1980s as a marketing category for non-Western traditional music.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=Erlmann, Veit|year=1996| title=Aesthetics of the Global Imagination: Reflections on World Music in the 1990s|journal=Public Culture|volume=8|issue=3|pages=467–488}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=The Discourse of World Music |author=Frith, Simon|editor=Born and Hesmondhalgh|year=2000|publisher=University of California Press|booktitle=Western Music and Its Others: Difference, Representation, and Appropriation in Music}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Brazilian actress, singer and dancer [[Carmen Miranda]] became known in the West as [[Exotism|exotic]] supplement in Hollywood films in the 1930s, akin to dancer [[Josephine Baker]] before, and the voice of [[exotica]] [[Yma Sumac]] after her. In the 1960s [[Elis Regina]] was the most prominent female singer in the [[Bossa Nova]] of Brazilian music that influenced popular music around the world. In the 1960s and 1970s Argentinian folk singer [[Mercedes Sosa]], South African [[Miriam Makeba]] or Greek [[Maria Farantouri]] were also recognized for their engagement against the oppressive political situation in their home states. Sosa singing "[[Gracias a la vida]]", Makeba's "[[Pata Pata]]", and Farantouri's collaboration with composer [[Mikis Theodorakis]] were musical icons of the struggle for [[human rights]]. The "Queen of Salsa" [[Celia Cruz]] immigrated from Cuba to the United States in 1966.

With the rising interest in the then so-called world music in the 1980s old recordings of long established artists were re-discovered for a global audience and distributed worldwide; well known in their home country –sometimes stars with legendary status– like Arabic singers [[Umm Kulthum]], [[Asmahan]], and [[Fairuz]], the Algerian [[Raï]] singer [[Cheikha Rimitti]], [[Asha Bhosle]], most prolific playback singer for [[Bollywood]] film soundtracks, Romani [[Esma Redžepova]], Mexican [[ranchera]] singer [[Chavela Vargas]], and the [[Mahotella Queens]] from South Africa; or they were recorded for the first time (by Caucasian males) like [[Cesária Évora]] from Cape Verde, [[Stella Chiweshe]] from Zimbabwe and Afro-Peruvian [[Susana Baca]].

There are many notable women world music performers, including: [[Ann Savoy]], [[Bi Kidude]], [[Brenda Fassie]], [[Chabuca Granda]], [[Chava Alberstein]], [[Cleoma Breaux Falcon]], [[Dolly Collins]], [[Elizabeth Cotten]], [[Frehel]], [[Gal Costa]], [[Genoa Keawe]], [[Googoosh]], [[Hazel Dickens]], [[Jean Ritchie]], [[Lata Mangeshkar]], [[Lola Beltrán]], [[Lucha Reyes (Peruvian singer)|Lucha Reyes]], [[Lucilla Galeazzi]] (The Mammas), [[Lydia Mendoza]], [[Maria Tanase]], [[Mariam Doumbia]], [[Nada Mamula]], [[Ofra Haza]], [[Oumou Sangare]], [[Rita Marley]], [[Rosa Passos]], [[Roza Eskenazi]], [[Safiye Ayla]], [[Salamat Sadikova]], [[Selda Bagcan]], [[Shirley Collins]], [[Valya Balkanska]], [[Violeta Parra]], [[Warda Al-Jazairia|Warda]], and [[Zap Mama]].

==Eastern music==

===Arabic music===
[[File:ComedianpartyBaghdad.jpg|thumb|right|200px|A group of musicians, including women performers, from a Baghdad [[musical theatre]] group in the 1920s]]
[[Arabic music]], which has [[Persian traditional music|Persian]] origins,&lt;ref&gt;''The Golden Age of the Moor''. By [[Ivan van Sertima]]. 1992. Transaction Publishers. {{ISBN|1-56000-581-5}}. p.17&lt;/ref&gt;
is an amalgam of the music of the [[Arab people]] in the [[Arabian Peninsula]] and the music of all the varied peoples that make up the Arab world. In [[Music of Egypt|Egypt during the medieval era]], male professional musicians during this period were called Alateeyeh (plural), or Alatee (singular), which means "a player upon an instrument". However, this name applies to both vocalists as well as instrumentalists. Male professional musicians were considered disreputable and lowly, and they earned their living playing at parties. Female professional musicians in Egypt were called Awalim (pl) or Al'meh, which means a "learned female". These singers were often hired on the occasion of a celebration in the [[harem]] of a wealthy person. They were not with the harem, but in an elevated room that was concealed by a screen so as not to be seen by either the harem or the master of the house. The female Awalim were more highly paid than male performers and more highly regarded.

In the 9th century,  using male instrumentalists was harshly criticized in a treatise, because male musicians were associated with perceived vices such as playing [[chess]] and writing [[love poetry]]. Following the invasion of Egypt, [[Napoleon]] commissioned reports on the state of [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] culture. The report reveals that there were [[guild]]s of male instrumentalists who played to male audiences, and "learned female" singer/musicians who sang and played for women audiences.

===Chinese music===

In [[Chinese music]], music was a major activity for women during Ancient times, especially for learned women. Women performers were associated with the [[guqin]] since ancient times. The guqin is a plucked seven-string [[Chinese musical instrument]] of the [[zither]] family. It has traditionally been favored by [[scholars]] and [[Scholar-bureaucrats|literati]] as an instrument of great subtlety and refinement. A notable woman guqin player was [[Cai Wenji]], associated with the piece ''Hujia Shiba-pai''.&lt;ref&gt;《胡笳十八拍》&lt;/ref&gt;

Women musicians also play a key role in Chinese folk music. In southern [[Fujian]] and [[Taiwan]], Nanyin or [[Nanguan music]] is a genre of traditional Chinese folk ballads. They are sung by a woman accompanied by a [[Xiao (flute)|xiao]] flute and a [[pipa]], as well as other traditional instruments. The music is generally sorrowful and typically deals with the topic of a love-stricken woman.

The [[Chinese pop]] (C-pop) music industry in the 1930s and 1940s was dominated by the [[Seven Great Singing Stars]], who were the most renowned singers of China in the 1940s. [[Zhou Xuan]], [[Gong Qiuxia]], [[Yao Lee]] and [[Bai Hong]] emerged in the 1930s, while [[Bai Guang]], [[Li Xianglan]] and [[Wu Yingyin]] became popular in the 1940s. After 1949, these early generations of C-pop were denounced by the [[Communist Party of China]] as [[Yellow Music]] as it saw pop music as sexually indecent (the color yellow is associated with eroticism and sex in China). Only after the end of the [[Cultural Revolution]], by the early 1980s, could Yellow Music be performed again.

Nowadays, after China's extensive political and cultural changes of the past 50 years, Chinese popular music has been increasingly emulating and taking inspiration from the styles of popular music of South Korea ([[K-pop]]) and of Japan ([[J-pop]]), both of which it now closely resembles. As such, during the 2010s, several [[girl groups]] have been established based both on the Japanese model, like [[SNH48]] (created in 2012) and its [[SNH48#Sister groups|sister groups]], as well as on the Korean model, like [[Rocket Girls (band)|Rocket Girls]], created in 2018 from the [[Produce 101 (Chinese TV series)|Chinese version]] of a Korean reality television talent competition show. These groups have achieved significant success, with the debut [[Extended play|EP]] of Rocket Girls selling over 1.6 million copies.&lt;ref name="Tencent"/&gt; Despite this though, solo Chinese female artists continue to be much more popular overall in the country, as they have traditionally been.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= https://y.qq.com/portal/singer_list.html#area=200&amp;page=1&amp;sex=-100&amp;|title= 歌手列表|accessdate= August 26, 2018|work= [[QQ Music]]|publisher= [[Tencent]]|language= Chinese}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some of the most recently popular solo Chinese female singers include 胡66, [[Ada Zhuang]], [[Kelly Yu]], 陳粒 ([[:zh:陳粒|zh]]), [[Feng Timo]], [[Bibi Zhou]], 双笙, [[Tia Ray]], 金玟岐 ([[:zh:金玟岐|zh]]) and [[Jane Zhang]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= https://y.qq.com/portal/singer_list.html#area=200&amp;page=1&amp;sex=1&amp;|title= 歌手列表|accessdate= August 26, 2018|work= [[QQ Music]]|publisher= [[Tencent]]|language= Chinese}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Indian music===
[[File:Ms subbulakshmi.jpg|thumb|right|140px|The Indian Carnatic classical singer [[M.S. Subbulakshmi]] (1916–2004)]]
[[Indian classical music]] is the [[art music]] of the [[Indian subcontinent]]. The origins of Indian classical music can be found in the [[Hindu]] hymns. This chanting style evolved into [[jatis]] and eventually into [[raga]]s. Indian classical music has also been significantly influenced by, or syncretised with, Indian folk music. The major composers from the historical Indian classical music tradition were men. Modern women vocalists include [[D. K. Pattammal]], [[M. S. Subbalakshmi]], [[Gangubai Hangal]], [[Hirabai Barodekar]], [[Kesarbai Kerkar]], [[Kishori Amonkar]], [[Malini Rajurkar]], [[Mogubai Kurdikar]], [[Prabha Atre]], [[Roshan Ara Begum]] and [[Shruti Sadolikar Katkar]]. One woman instrumentalist is [[Annapurna Devi]].

In [[Indian folk music]], [[lavani]] is a music genre popular in [[Maharashtra]] that is traditionally performed by women.
[[Bhangra (music)|Bhangra]] ([[Gurmukhi|Punjabi]]: ਭੰਗੜਾ) is a form of [[dance]]-oriented [[folk music]] of [[Punjab region|Punjab]]. The present musical style is derived from non traditional musical accompaniment to the riffs of [[Punjab (India)|Punjab]] called by the same name. The female dance of [[Punjab region]] is known as [[Giddha]] ([[Gurmukhi|Punjabi]]: ਗਿੱਧਾ).

In the [[music of Bollywood]] (the centre of India's film industry) and other regional film industries in India, women [[playback singer]]s have had a significant role, with the sisters [[Lata Mangeshkar]] and [[Asha Bhosle]], who have mainly worked in Hindi films, often referred to as two of the best-known and most prolific playback singers in India. In 2011, Bhosle was officially acknowledged by the ''[[Guinness Book of World Records]]'' as the most recorded artist in music history.&lt;ref name="indiatoday.intoday.in"/&gt;

===Iranian music===
[[File:Parisa.jpg|thumb|left|120px|Fātemeh Vā'ezi ({{lang-fa|فاطمه واعظی}}) (born 1950), commonly known by her stage name Parīsā ({{lang-fa| پریسا}}), is a [[Persian traditional music|Persian classical]] vocalist and musician.]]

Since the [[Iranian revolution]], Iranian female solo vocalists have been permitted to perform for female audiences. Female vocalists can perform for male audiences only as a part of a chorus. Traditionally, it has been difficult for female singers to appear publicly. Women were only allowed to perform for religious rituals, called [[Tazieh]], and men were generally forbidden to listen to women. Before the Revolution, [[Women's rights in Iran|Iranian women]] could only sing in private, while working, for other women, or during women's celebrations. [[Qamar ol-Molouk Vaziri]] (1905-1959) is one of the first female masters of Persian music. Notable female musicians include [[Delkash]] (1923-2004); [[Simin Ghanem]] (born 1944); [[Maryam Akhondy]] (born 1957), founder of Barbad Ensemble; Persian classical guitarist [[Lily Afshar]]; singer [[Shakila]], winner of Persian Academy Award; the conductor [[Soodabeh Salem]]; [[Afsaneh Rasaei]]; [[Pirayeh Pourafar]], founder of Nava Ensemble and Lian Ensemble; and [[Mahsa Vahdat]].

The classical singer [[Fatemeh Vaezi]] (commonly known by her stage name "Parisa") has given concerts accompanied by a female orchestra. After 1986 [[Maryam Akhondy]] started working with other Iranian musicians in exile. In 2000 Maryam Akhondy created the all-female a cappella group  Banu which sung old folk songs that were part of women's activities and celebrations. Singer [[Sima Bina]] has taught many female students. [[Ghashang Kamkar]] teaches both male and female students. Both Ghashang and Vaezi have criticized the patriarchal power structure in Iran for its treatment of female musicians.&lt;ref&gt;Fereshteh Javaheri, 'With These Problems of Life, There Is No Time for Art,' trans. Maryam Habibian, Zanan, No. 36 (1997), p. 23.&lt;/ref&gt; Iranian folk-music performers include [[Sima Bina]], [[Darya Dadvar]], [[Monika Jalili]], [[Ziba Shirazi]], [[Zohreh Jooya]], and [[Shusha Guppy|Shushā Guppy]]. Iranian pop performers include [[Googoosh]], [[Hayedeh]], [[Mahasti]], [[Leila Forouhar]], [[Pooran (singer)|Pooran]], and [[Laleh Pourkarim]]. World music performers include [[Azam Ali]] and [[Cyminology|Cymin Samawatie]].

==Music scholars and educators==

===Musicologists and music historians===
[[File:Rosetta Reitz.jpg|thumb|right|220px|[[Rosetta Reitz]] (1924–2008) was an American [[jazz]] historian and [[feminist]] who established a record label producing 18 albums of the music of the early women of jazz and the blues.&lt;ref name=NYTObit&gt;Martin, Douglas. [https://www.nytimes.com/2008/11/15/arts/music/15reitz.html "Rosetta Reitz, Champion of Jazz Women, Dies at 84"], ''[[The New York Times]]'', 14 November 2008. Accessed 19 November 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;]]

The vast majority of major [[musicology|musicologists]] and music historians have been men. Nevertheless, some women musicologists have reached the top ranks of the profession. [[Carolyn Abbate]] (born 1956) is an American musicologist who did her PhD at [[Princeton University]]. She has been described by the ''[[Harvard Gazette]]'' as "one of the world's most accomplished and admired music historians".&lt;ref name=HG&gt;[http://news.harvard.edu/gazette/story/2013/11/abbate-named-university-professor/ "Abbate named University Professor"], ''Harvard Gazette'', 20 November 2013. Accessed 10 December 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Susan McClary]] (born 1946) is a musicologist associated with the "[[New Musicology]]" who incorporates [[feminism|feminist]] music criticism in her work. McClary holds a PhD from [[Harvard University]]. One of her best known works is ''Feminine Endings'' (1991), which covers musical constructions of gender and sexuality, gendered aspects of traditional music theory, gendered sexuality in musical narrative, music as a gendered discourse and issues affecting women musicians. In the book, McClary suggests that the [[sonata form]] (used in symphonies and string quartets) may be a [[sexist]] or [[misogynist]]ic procedure that constructs of [[gender]] and sexual identity. McClary's ''Conventional Wisdom'' (2000) argues that the traditional musicological assumption of the existence of "purely musical" elements, divorced from culture and meaning, the social and the body, is a conceit used to veil the social and political imperatives of the worldview that produces the [[classical canon]] most prized by supposedly objective musicologists.

Other notable women scholars include:

*[[Eva Badura-Skoda]]
*[[Margaret Bent]]
*[[Suzanne Cusick]]
*[[Ursula Günther]]
*[[Maud Cuney Hare]]

===Ethnomusicologists===
[[File:Frances Densmore.jpg|thumb|right|150px|[[Frances Densmore]] (1867&amp;nbsp;&amp;ndash; 1957) was an [[United States|American]] [[anthropology|anthropologist]] and [[ethnography|ethnographer]] known for her studies of [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]] [[music]] and [[culture]].]]

[[Ethnomusicology|Ethnomusicologists]] study the many musics around the world that emphasize their cultural, social, material, cognitive, biological, and other dimensions or contexts instead of or in addition to its isolated sound component or any particular repertoire.
Ethnomusicology –&amp;nbsp;a term coined by [[Jaap Kunst]] from the [[Greek language|Greek]] words ἔθνος (''ethnos'', "nation") and μουσική (''mousike'', "music")&amp;nbsp;– is often described as the [[anthropology]] or [[ethnography]] of music. Initially, ethnomusicology was almost exclusively oriented toward non-[[Western world|Western]] music, but now includes the study of Western music from anthropological, sociological and intercultural perspectives.

Notable ethnomusicologists include:

*[[Judith Becker]]
*[[Frances Densmore]]
*[[Ida Halpern]]
*[[Maud Karpeles]]

===Music educators===

{{Main|Women in music education}}
While music critics argued in the 1880s that "women lacked the innate creativity to compose good music" due to "biological predisposition",&lt;ref name="parlorsongs.com"/&gt; later, it was accepted that women would have a role in [[music education]], and they became involved in this field "to such a degree that women dominated music education during the latter half of the 19th century and well into the 20th century."&lt;ref name="parlorsongs.com"/&gt; "Traditional accounts of the history of music education [in the US] have often neglected the contributions of women, because these texts have emphasized bands and the top leaders in hierarchical music organizations."&lt;ref name="Sandra Wieland Howe 2015"&gt;Dr. Sandra Wieland Howe. "Women Music Educators In The United States: A History", in ''GEMS (Gender, Education, Music, and Society)'', the on-line journal of Gender Research in Music Education. Vol 8, No 4 (2015)&lt;/ref&gt; When looking beyond these bandleaders and top leaders, women had many music education roles in the "home, community, churches, public schools, and teacher-training institutions" and "as writers, patrons, and through their volunteer work in organizations."&lt;ref name="Sandra Wieland Howe 2015"/&gt;

Despite the limitations imposed on women's roles in music education in the 19th century, women were accepted as [[kindergarten]] teachers, because this was deemed to be a "private sphere". Women also taught music privately, in girl's schools, Sunday schools, and they trained musicians in school music programs. By the turn of the 20th century, women began to be employed as music supervisors in elementary schools, teachers in [[normal school]]s and professors of music in universities. Women also became more active in professional organizations in music education, and women presented papers at conferences.

A woman, Frances Clarke (1860-1958) founded the [[National Association for Music Education|Music Supervisors National Conference]] in 1907. While a small number of women served as President of the Music Supervisors National Conference (and the following renamed versions of the organization over the next century) in the early 20th century, there were only two female Presidents between 1952 and 1992, which "[p]ossibly reflects discrimination." After 1990, however, leadership roles for women in the organization opened up. From 1990 to 2010, there were five female Presidents of this organization.&lt;ref name="slideshare.net"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.slideshare.net/bigbadbariguru/a-historical-view-of-women-in-music-education-careers |title=A historical view of women in music education careers |publisher=Slideshare.net |date=2012-07-05 |accessdate=2016-01-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; Women music educators "outnumber men two-to-one" in teaching general music, choir, private lessons, and keyboard instruction .&lt;ref name="slideshare.net"/&gt; More men tend to be hired as for band education, administration and jazz jobs, and more men work in colleges and universities.&lt;ref name="slideshare.net"/&gt; According to Dr. Sandra Wieland Howe, there is still a "[[glass ceiling]]" for women in music education careers, as there is "stigma" associated with women in leadership positions and "men outnumber women as administrators."&lt;ref name="slideshare.net"/&gt;

The majority of professional orchestra [[Conducting|conductors]] are male; ''The Guardian'' called conducting "one of the last [[glass ceilings]] in the music industry".&lt;ref name="motherjones.com"/&gt; A 2013 article stated that in France, out of 574 concerts only 17 were conducted by women and no women conducted at the [[Paris National Opera|National Opéra in Paris]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | author=Victor Tribot Laspière | title=Une main ferme à l’Orchestre national de France | url=http://www.francemusique.fr/actu-musicale/ou-sont-les-femmes-dans-la-musique-7766 | work=France Musique | date=2013-10-02 | accessdate=2016-10-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Bachtrack'' reported that, in a list of the world's 150 top conductors that year, only five were women.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.classical-music.com/article/11-of-best-female-conductors |title=11 of today's top women conductors |publisher=Classical-Music.com |date=2015-03-06 |accessdate=2016-01-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; A small number of female conductors have become top-ranked international conductors. In January 2005, Australian conductor [[Simone Young]] became the first woman to conduct the [[Vienna Philharmonic]]. In 2008 [[Marin Alsop]], a protégé of [[Leonard Bernstein]], became the first woman to become the music director and principal conductor of a major US orchestra when she won the top job at the [[Baltimore Symphony]].&lt;ref name="bbc.com"&gt;{{cite web|last=Burton |first=Clemency |url=http://www.bbc.com/culture/story/20130821-why-so-few-women-conductors |title=Culture - Why aren't there more women conductors? |publisher=BBC |date=2014-10-21 |accessdate=2016-01-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; There were "protests from a large swathe of the Baltimore Symphony when she was first named Music Director", but since that time, "plaudits [have] roll[ed] in."&lt;ref name="bbc.com"/&gt; In 2014, Alsop was the first woman conductor to lead the [[Last Night of the Proms]] concert–one of the most important classical music events in Britain–in its 118-year history.&lt;ref name="bbc.com"/&gt;

[[Jeri Lynne Johnson]] was the first [[African-American]] woman to win an international conducting prize when she was awarded the Taki Concordia conducting fellowship in 2005. She is the founder and music director of the Black Pearl Chamber Orchestra, the first multi-ethnic professional [[orchestra]] in [[Philadelphia]]. A graduate of [[Wellesley College]] and the [[University of Chicago]], she is a [[Conducting|conductor]], [[composer]] and [[pianist]]. From 2001-2004, she was the assistant conductor of The [[Chamber Orchestra of Philadelphia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=YtoDAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA54&amp;dq=%22jeri+lynne+johnson%22&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=6vLxS8CJM8GB8gb0sZzvDQ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CC0Q6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=%22jeri%20lynne%20johnson%22&amp;f=false|title=Sisters in the Spotlight|date=March 2003|work=[[Ebony (magazine)|Ebony]]|accessdate=18 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; She has led orchestras around the world including the [[Colorado Symphony Orchestra|Colorado Symphony]], [[Bournemouth Symphony Orchestra|Bournemouth Symphony]] (UK), and the Weimar Staatskapelle (Germany). Alongside prominent woman conductors [[Marin Alsop]] and [[JoAnn Falletta]], Ms. Johnson was heralded on the [[NBC]] [[Today (NBC program)|Today Show]] as one of the nation's leading female conductors.

According to the UK's Radio 3 editor, Edwina Wolstencroft, "The music world has been happy to have female performers ...for a long time...[;]But owning authority and power in public is another matter. That's where female conductors have had a hard time. Our society is more resistant to women being powerful in public than to women being entertaining."&lt;ref name="theguardian.com"/&gt; The low percentage of women conductors is not because women do not study in [[music school]]; indeed, in 2009 and 2012 almost half of the recipients of [[Doctor of Musical Arts|conducting doctorates]] were women.&lt;ref name="motherjones.com"/&gt;

===Sexism and gender discrimination===
Women conductors faced sexism and gender discrimination throughout the 19th century and 20th century. "To break down this apparent employment barrier, women created their own opportunities by founding and organizing all-female orchestras"; one example is the Fadette Women's Orchestra in Boston founded in 1888 by conductor Caroline B. Nichols.&lt;ref&gt;[http://symposium.music.org/index.php?option=com_k2&amp;view=item&amp;id=2151:women-orchestral-conductors-in-america-the-struggle-for-acceptance%E2%80%94an-historical-view-from-the-nineteenth-century-to-the-present&amp;Itemid=124] {{dead link|date=April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; A number of other all-women orchestras were founded in the early decades of the 20th century, and women conductors led these groups.

Women conductors continue to face sexism and gender discrimination in the early decades of the 21st century. In the 2010s, several notable male conductors and musicians made sexist statements about women conductors. In 2013, "[[Vasily Petrenko]], the principal conductor of the [[Oslo Philharmonic]] and the [[Royal Liverpool Philharmonic]], provoked outrage when he told a Norwegian newspaper that 'orchestras react better when they have a man in front of them."&lt;ref name="theguardian1"&gt;{{cite web|author1=Charlotte Higgins |author2=chief arts writer |url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2013/sep/02/male-conductors-better-orchestras-vasily-petrenko |title=Male conductors are better for orchestras, says Vasily Petrenko &amp;#124; Music |publisher=The Guardian |date= |accessdate=2016-01-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also stated that "when women have families, it becomes difficult to be as dedicated as is demanded in the business".&lt;ref name="theguardian1"/&gt; [[Bruno Mantovani]], the director of the [[Paris Conservatoire]], gave an interview in which he made sexist statements about women conductors. Mantovani raised the "problem of [[maternity]]" and he questioned the ability of women to withstand the physical challenges and stresses of the profession, which he claimed involve "conducting, taking a plane, taking another plane, conducting again."&lt;ref name="music.cbc.ca"/&gt; [[Yuri Temirkanov]], the music director of the [[St. Petersburg Philharmonic]], made sexist statements about women conductors in a September 2013 interview, stating that "The essence of the conductor's profession is strength. The essence of a woman is weakness."&lt;ref name="music.cbc.ca"/&gt; Finnish conductor [[Jorma Panula]] made sexist statements about women conductors in 2014; he stated that "women [conductors are not]… getting any better – only worse", which he called a "purely biological question."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.musicaltoronto.org/2014/04/05/editorial-cbc-classical-music-gender-gap-article-poses-new-questions/ |title=Musical Toronto |publisher=Musical Toronto |date= |accessdate=2016-01-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Music critics==

===Popular music===
[[File:Ann Powers 01A.jpg|thumb|right|200px|American pop music critic [[Ann Powers]] (pictured in 2007)]]
According to Anwen Crawford, the "problem for women [popular music critics] is that our role in popular music was codified long ago", which means that "[b]ooks by living female rock critics (or jazz, hip-hop, and dance-music critics, for that matter) are scant". Crawford notes that the "most famous rock-music critics—[[Robert Christgau]], [[Greil Marcus]], [[Lester Bangs]], [[Nick Kent]]—are all male".&lt;ref name="newyorker.com"/&gt;

Sociologist [[Simon Frith]] noted that pop and rock music "are closely associated with gender; that is, with conventions of male and female behaviour".&lt;ref name=Frith2001&gt;Frith, Simon, "Pop Music" in S. Frith, W. Stray and J. Street, ''[[Cambridge Companions to Music|The Cambridge Companion to Pop and Rock]]'' (Cambridge University Press, 2001), p. 226.&lt;/ref&gt; According to Holly Kruse, both popular music articles and academic articles about pop music are usually written from "masculine subject positions".&lt;ref&gt;Jones, Steve, ed. (2002). Pop Music and the Press. Temple University Press. ASIN B00EKYXY0K. {{ISBN|9781566399661}}. p. 134&lt;/ref&gt; As well, there are relatively few women writing in music journalism: "By 1999, the number of female editors or senior writers at ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' hovered around...15%, [while] at ''[[Spin (magazine)|Spin]]'' and ''[[Ray Gun (magazine)|Raygun]]'', [it was] roughly 20%."&lt;ref&gt;McLeod (2002) at 94, quoted in {{cite book|last=Leonard|first=Marion |chapter=Meaning Making in the Press |title=Gender in the Music Industry: Rock, Discourse, and Girl Power |location=Aldershot, Hampshire, England  |year= 2007 |page=67 |publisher=Ashgate Publishing, Ltd  |isbn=9780754638629 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=eMtDpy85IC4C&amp;pg=PA67 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Criticism associated with gender was discussed in a 2014 ''[[Jezebel (website)|Jezebel]]'' article about the struggles of women in music journalism, written by music critic Tracy Moore, previously an editor at the ''[[Nashville Scene]]''.&lt;ref name=moore2014&gt;{{cite web|author=Moore, Tracy |date=20 March 2014 |title=Oh, the Unbelievable Shit You Get Writing About Music as a Woman |work=[[Jezebel (website)|Jezebel]] |url=http://jezebel.com/oh-the-unbelievable-shit-you-get-writing-about-music-a-1547444869 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The American music critic [[Ann Powers]], as a female critic and journalist for a popular, male-dominated industry, has written critiques the perceptions of sex, racial and social minorities in the music industry. She has also written about feminism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nwp.org/cs/public/print/resource/3696 |title=Why I Write: Ann Powers Reflects on Writing About Rock|website=Nwp.org|accessdate=19 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="rockhall"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://rockhall.com/blog/post/6485_guest-blog-ann-powers/|title=Pop music critic Ann Powers searches for the language of rock and roll|website=Rockhall.com|accessdate=19 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2006 she accepted a position as chief pop-music critic at the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'', where she succeeded [[Robert Hilburn]].&lt;ref&gt;Patrick MacDonald, [http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/artsentertainment/2002848360_aebriefs07.html Ann Powers named L.A.

Anwen Crawford, a writer for ''[[The Monthly]]'' contributed to Jessica Hopper's book of essays and profiles entitled ''The First Collection of Criticism by a Living Female Rock Critic''.&lt;ref name="thefader.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thefader.com/2015/06/03/the-world-doesnt-need-more-female-music-critics|title=The World Doesn’t Need More Female Music Critics|website=Thefader.com|accessdate=7 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Crawford's article "explores women's long struggle for visibility and recognition in the field of rock criticism, even though we've been helping to pioneer it from the start".&lt;ref name="thefader.com"/&gt; Crawford states that "[t]he record store, the guitar shop, and now social media: when it comes to popular music, these places become stages for the display of male prowess"; "[f]emale expertise, when it appears, is repeatedly dismissed as fraudulent. Every woman who has ever ventured an opinion on popular music could give you some variation [of this experience]... and becoming a recognized "expert" (a musician, a critic) will not save [women] from accusations of fakery."&lt;ref name="thefader.com"/&gt;

===Classical music===
[[File:Marion Lignana Rosenberg.png|thumb|right|180px|[[Marion Lignana Rosenberg]] (1961–2013) was a music critic, writer, translator, broadcaster and journalist. She wrote for many periodicals, including [[Salon (website)|Salon.com]], ''[[The New York Times]]'' and ''[[Playbill]]''.]]
"The National Arts Journalism Program (NAJP) at Columbia... completed a large study of arts journalism in America [in 2005]. They found that 'the average classical music critic is a white, 52-year-old male with a [[graduate degree]], but twenty-six percent of all critics writing are female.'" However, William Osborne points out that this 26% figure includes all newspapers, including low-circulation regional papers. Osborne states that the "large US papers, which are the ones that influence public opinion, have virtually no women classical music critics." The only female critics from major US papers are [[Anne Midgette]] (''New York Times'') and Wynne Delacoma (''Chicago Sun-Times''). Midgette was the "first woman to cover classical music in the entire history of the paper."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.osborne-conant.org/women-critics.htm |title=Women Music Critics |publisher=Osborne-conant.org |date=2005-06-11 |accessdate=2016-01-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Susannah Clapp]], a critic from ''The Guardian''–a newspaper that has a female classical music critic–stated in May 2014 that she had only then realized "what a rarity" a female classical music critic is in journalism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2014/may/25/sexism-stage-critics-tara-erraught-glyndebourne |title=Time to bring down the curtain on stage critics' sexism &amp;#124; Stage |publisher=The Guardian |date=2014-05-28 |accessdate=2016-01-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other musical professions==

===Record producing and sound engineering===
A 2013 ''Sound on Sound'' article stated that there are "few women in [[Music producer|record production]] and [[sound engineering]]."&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Ncube |first=Rosina |title=Sounding Off: Why So Few Women In Audio? |url=http://www.soundonsound.com/sos/sep13/articles/sounding-off-0913.htm |journal=Sound on Sound |date=September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ncube states that "[n]inety-five percent of music producers are male, and although there are female producers achieving great things in music, they are less well-known than their male counterparts."&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt; "Only three women have ever been nominated for best producer at the Brits or the [[Grammys]]" and none won either award.&lt;ref name="ReferenceC"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/entertainment-arts-19284058 |title=Why are female record producers so rare? - BBC News |publisher=Bbc.com |date=2012-08-29 |accessdate=2016-01-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; "Women who want to enter the [producing] field face a boys' club, or a [[guild]] mentality".&lt;ref name="ReferenceC"/&gt; The UK "Music Producers' Guild says less than 4% of its members are women" and at the Liverpool Institute of Performing Arts, "only 6% of the students enrolled on its sound technology course are female."&lt;ref name="ReferenceC"/&gt; Speaking about the 1970s, Tom Jones mentions in his recent autobiography "We had [[Lynsey de Paul]], a big star, though she fell out with [[Gordon Mills]] for wanting to produce her own records" - however, she managed to do this and eventually produced male artists such as ex-Move singer [[Carl Wayne]] and [[Lenny Zakatek]], as well as [[Vera Lynn]] and [[Shirley Bassey]].&lt;ref&gt;Sir Tom Jones (2015). Over The Top and Back: The Autobiography. {{ISBN|978-1592409617}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

In Ruth Saxelby's article "Why aren't more women becoming music producers?", she states that "beats aren't gendered, so why do women represent less than 5% of music producers and engineers"? Saxelby interviewed 13 women who work as music producers to seek the potential causes of this situation.&lt;ref name=Fader&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thefader.com/2014/10/30/why-arent-more-women-becoming-music-producers|title=Why aren't more women becoming music producers?|date=30 October 2014|work=The FADER|first=Ruth|last=Saxelby}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fatima Al Qadiri from New York states that "women are expected to be the sexualized commercial object for sale in music, and production and engineering [are fields where women are] rarely [able to be] objectified for financial gain [by the music industry]"; as such, the industry does not use women producers or engineers.&lt;ref name=Fader/&gt; Qadiri said barriers to women in production and sound engineering include "misogyny, sexism, unequal pay,...[and] pressure to make your body (rather than your music) the central focus of your career."&lt;ref name=Fader/&gt; Caroline Polachek from New York states that "an artist is not as likely to bring in a woman to produce his track as a man, not because of a bias against women per se, but because on some level it's playing safe: a killer producer, history tells us, looks like a man."&lt;ref name=Fader/&gt;

[[WondaGurl]] from Toronto states that "there aren't many female producer and engineers, because they find this side of the business to be mostly male-dominated and many woman do not like to have to compete with men."&lt;ref name=Fader/&gt; Holly Herndon from San Francisco states that "[m]usic, despite common misconceptions, is quite conservative. The archetypes don't seem to ever really change...Every year we get a diva, a dancer,...a girl next door, a fashion queen, a dainty songstress; all younger updates on a previous [year's] model. No room for new archetypes [such as women producers]." Herndon points out that [[Missy Elliott]] "exists outside of those narrow roles..."&lt;ref name=Fader/&gt; Asma Maroof from Los Angeles says women are "intimidated by such a male-driven profession."&lt;ref name=Fader/&gt;

Tokimonsta, also from Los Angeles, states that "our culture has systematically engrained this idea that technology is more of a man's thing."&lt;ref name=Fader/&gt; Ikonika from London, UK, states that the music industry is "sexist and racist".&lt;ref name=Fader/&gt; Anna Lunoe from Sydney, Australia, states that "more girls [should be] exposed to introductory production workshops" and "production mentoring programs that are... aimed at promising young female engineers".&lt;ref name=Fader/&gt; Leila from London, UK, states that "[t]here have been a fair few [female producers and engineers]", from [[Delia Derbyshire]] to [[Tina Weymouth]] to Susan Day to Missy Elliot to [[Zavoloka]]. Leila suggests that to increase the number of women in music production and sound engineering, girls should be given training in computers and software coding.

One of the first women to produce, engineer, arrange and promote music on her own [[rock and roll]] music label was [[Cordell Jackson]] (1923-2004). She founded the Moon Records label in Memphis in 1956 after a few years of recording demos at [[Sam Phillips]]' Memphis Recording Service and [[Sun Records Studio]]. Unable to break into the [[Sun Records]] label's stable of male artists, she received the advice and assistance of [[RCA Records]]' [[Chet Atkins]] in forming this new label to release her music. She began releasing and promoting on the label singles she recorded in her home studio, serving as engineer, producer and arranger. The artists recorded included her and a small family of early [[rock and roll]], [[rockabilly]], and [[country music]] performers she recruited from several Southern states.

[[Trina Shoemaker]] is a mixer, [[record producer]] and [[sound engineer]] responsible for producing/engineering and/or mixing records for bands such as [[Queens of the Stone Age]],&lt;ref name="Allmusic credits1"&gt;{{cite web|title=Trina Shoemaker Credits|url=http://allmusic.com/artist/trina-shoemaker-p161871/credits|work=[[Allmusic]]|accessdate=26 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Sheryl Crow]],&lt;ref name="Allmusic credits1" /&gt; [[Emmylou Harris]],&lt;ref name="Allmusic credits1" /&gt; [[Something for Kate]],&lt;ref name="Allmusic credits2"&gt;{{cite web|title=Trina Shoemaker Credits (pg. 2)|url=http://allmusic.com/artist/trina-shoemaker-p161871/credits/date-asc/100|work=[[Allmusic]]|accessdate=26 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Nanci Griffith]]&lt;ref name="Allmusic credits2" /&gt;  and many more.

[[Gail Davies]] was the '...first female producer in [[country music]], delivering a string of Top 10 hits in the '70s and '80s including "[[Someone Is Looking for Someone Like You]]," "[[Blue Heartache]]" and "[[I'll Be There (If You Ever Want Me)]]."&lt;ref name="nashvillescene.com"/&gt; When she moved to [[Nashville]] in 1976, men "didn't want to work for a woman" and she was told women in the city were "still barefoot, pregnant and [singing] in the vocal booth."&lt;ref name="nashvillescene.com"/&gt; 
[[Wendy Waldman]], who became a producer after Davies, saw that Davies had a difficult time. When Jonell Polansky arrived in Nashville in 1994, with a degree in [[electrical engineering]] and recording experience in the Bay Area, she was told "[y]ou're a woman, and we already had one"–a reference to Waldman.&lt;ref name="nashvillescene.com"/&gt; 
KK Proffitt, who is a studio "owner and chief engineer" states that men in Nashville do not want to have women in the recording booth. At a meeting of the [[Audio Engineering Society]], Proffitt was told to "shut up" by a male producer when she raised the issue of updating studio recording technologies.&lt;ref name="nashvillescene.com"/&gt; Proffitt said she finds "finds sexism rampant in the industry".&lt;ref name="nashvillescene.com"/&gt;

===DJs and turntablists ===

[[File:FemaleDJ.jpg|thumb|right|200px|A DJ mixing two record players at a live event]]
Women in music are often seen mainly in singing roles in [[popular music]] and there are relatively few women [[DJ]]s or [[turntablist]]s in [[hip hop music]], [[house music]], [[nu metal]] and other genres where DJs and turntablists participate. Indeed, all of these genres are very male-dominated. Part of this may stem from a general low percentage of women in audio technology-related jobs, such as audio engineering and production.  In 2007 Mark Katz's article "Men, Women, and Turntables: Gender and the DJ Battle," stated that "very few women battle; the matter has been a topic of conversation among hip-hop DJs for years."&lt;ref name="Katz"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Katz|first=Mark|date=12 December 2007|title=Men, Women, and Turntables: Gender and the DJ Battle|url=https://mq.oxfordjournals.org/content/89/4/580.full#fn-9|journal=The Musical Quarterly|doi=10.1093/musqtl/gdm007|pmid=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2010 Rebekah Farrugia states "the male-centricity of EDM culture" contributes to "a marginalisation of women in these [EDM] spaces." &lt;ref name="Farrugia"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Beyond the Dance Floor: Female DJs, Technology and Electronic Dance Music Culture|last=Farrugia |first=Rebekah |publisher=University of Chicago Press|year=2013|isbn=978-1841505664|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; While turntablism and broader DJ practices should not be conflated, Katz suggests use or lack of use of the turntable broadly by women across genres and disciplines is impacted upon by what he defines as "male technophilia."&lt;ref name="Katz" /&gt; Historian Ruth Oldenziel concurs in her writing on engineering with this idea of socialization as a central factor in the lack of engagement with technology. She explains: "an exclusive focus on women's supposed failure to enter the field … is insufficient for understanding how our stereotypical notions have come into being; it tends to put the burden of proof entirely on women and to blame them for their supposedly inadequate socialization, their lack of aspiration, and their want of masculine values.

===Riot Grrrl===
[[File:Carrie Brownstein.jpg|thumb|right|180px|[[Carrie Brownstein]] from the punk-indie band [[Sleater-Kinney]], performing at Vegoose in 2005]]
[[Riot grrrl]] is an [[underground music|underground]] [[feminist]] [[hardcore punk]] movement that originally started in the early 1990s, in Washington, D.C.,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sheknows.com/entertainment/articles/1080646/its-riot-grrrl-day-in-boston-here-are-songs-to-rock-out-to-at-work|title=Boston wins 'Most Feminist City' with Riot Grrrl Day — we made a playlist to celebrate|date=9 April 2015|website=Sheknows.com|accessdate=7 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the greater [[Pacific Northwest]], noticeably in [[Olympia, Washington]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Feliciano|first1=Steve|title=The Riot Grrrl Movement |url=http://www.nypl.org/blog/2013/06/19/riot-grrrl-movement|publisher=New York Public Library}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is often associated with [[third-wave feminism]], which is sometimes seen as its starting point. It has also been described as a musical genre that came out of indie rock, with the punk scene serving as an inspiration for a musical movement in which women could express themselves in the same way men had been doing for the past several years.&lt;ref&gt;Marion Leonard. "Riot grrrl." Grove Music Online. Oxford Music Online. Oxford University Press. Web. 20 July 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

Riot grrrl bands often address issues such as rape, [[domestic abuse]], [[Human sexuality|sexuality]], racism, [[patriarchy]], and female [[empowerment]]. Bands associated with the movement include [[Bikini Kill]], [[Bratmobile]], [[Heavens to Betsy]], [[Excuse 17]], [[Huggy Bear (band)|Huggy Bear]], [[Cake Like]], [[Skinned Teen]], [[Emily's Sassy Lime]], [[Sleater-Kinney]], and also [[queercore]] groups like [[Team Dresch]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hot-topic.org/node/13|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090223012118/http://www.hot-topic.org/node/13 |archivedate=23 February 2009|title=List of Riot Girl Bands |publisher=Hot-topic.org |accessdate=30 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-zqSn0jMJAQC&amp;lpg=PA42&amp;dq=Dickless%20riot&amp;pg=PA42#v=onepage&amp;q=Dickless&amp;f=false|first=Marisa|last=Meltzer|page=42 |title=Girl Power: The Nineties Revolution in Music|publisher=Macmillan|isbn=9781429933285|date=15 February 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to a [[Indie music scenes|music scene]] and [[genre]], riot grrrl is a [[subculture]] involving a [[DIY ethic]], [[zine]]s, art, political action, and activism.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| publisher = W.W.

The use of the word "girl" was meant to indicate a time when girls are least influenced by societal pressures and therefore have the strongest self-esteem – childhood. The anger behind the movement was noted by the alternate spelling of the word as "grrrl", which sounds like a growl.&lt;ref name="Schilt" /&gt;

They partook in a new type of punk feminism that promoted the idea of do-it-yourself, exchanging [[manifesto]]s and trading mixed tapes of favorite bands to get the word out.&lt;ref name="Nguyen 173–196"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Nguyen|first=Mimi Thi|date=2012-07-01|title=Riot Grrrl, Race, and Revival|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1080/0740770X.2012.721082|journal=Women &amp; Performance: a journal of feminist theory|volume=22|issue=2-3|pages=173–196|doi=10.1080/0740770X.2012.721082|issn=0740-770X}}&lt;/ref&gt; They were tired of women being erased from history or having their experiences misinterpreted and ignored by others. In, response to patriarchal violence, adultism, and [[heterocentrism]],&lt;ref name="Kearney"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kearney|first=Mary Celeste|year=1995|title=Riot Grrrl: It's Not Just Music, It's Not Just Punk|url=|journal=Spectator|volume=16|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Riot grrrl engaged in negative emotional expressions and rhetoric similar to that of feminism and the punk aesthetic. The feminist argument that the personal is political was revisited in the image that Riot grrrl set forth, similarly to the culture of Punk that [[self-actualization]] is not to be found in external forces but rather through an individual's true self. By recognizing and reevaluating the institutional structures that affect individual experiences within social situations, an individual can gain the knowledge to better know herself and therefore know how to present herself to others so that they may know her accurately. Riot grrrl termed this movement to self-actualization, girl love – "girls learning to love themselves, and each other, against those forces that would otherwise see them destroyed or destroy themselves".

The accompanying slogan "every girl is a riot grrrl" reinforced the solidarity that women could find amongst themselves. This created an intimate aesthetic and sentimental politic well expressed in the production of zines (a shortened version of "fanzines").&lt;ref name="Schilt" /&gt; [[Zine]]s were handmade, crafted by individuals who wanted to connect directly with their readers, with simple items like scissors, glue, and tape. They called out injustices and challenged the norms that typically directed the expression of sexuality and domestic abuse, providing a space for women to exchange personal stories to which many others could relate. They challenged girls and women alike to stand up for themselves in a political atmosphere that actively sought to silence them.&lt;ref name="Kearney" /&gt; The shared personal stories were, at times, met with attitudes that reduced the communication to "it’s all just girls in their bedrooms, sprawled out writing in their diaries, and then they’ll send them to each other", while the choice to share in that way was an aesthetic one.

In the midst of this raising of awareness, riot grrrls had to address the generalizations that worked for them but that could not apply to women of color. Not all girls could be riot grrrl after all, for lack of privilege barred them from participating in such acts as writing "SLUT" across their stomach in an attempt to reclaim sexual agency.&lt;ref name="Nguyen 173–196"/&gt; While this performance is an earnest one, racism had already labeled women of color as that term. As observed by Kearny, "the gender deviance displayed by riot grrrls is a privilege to which only middle-class white girls have access."&lt;ref name="Kearney" /&gt; Another aspect of this need for inclusive [[discourse]] arose in the movement's preference for concrete knowledge and a disregard for the abstract that would foster theoretical inquiry.

===Festivals===
Women's music festivals, which may also be called [[womyn]]'s music festivals, have been held since the 1970s. Some women's music festivals are organized for [[lesbian]]s. The first women's music festival was held in 1973 at Sacramento State University. In May, 1974 the first National Woman's Music Festival was held in Champaign-Urbana, Illinois, founded by [[University of Illinois]] student Kristin Lems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://idnc.library.illinois.edu/cgi-bin/illinois?a=d&amp;d=DIL19740326.2.55&amp;srpos=6&amp;e=-------en-20--1--txt-txIN-national+women's+music+festival------|title=Daily Illini 26 March 1974 — Illinois Digital Newspaper Collections|website=Idnc.library.illinois.edu|accessdate=7 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; It celebrated its fortieth year in Middleton, Wisconsin, from 2–5 July 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wiaonline.org|title=National Womens Music Festival - July 5-8, 2018     Middleton, Wisconsin|website=Wiaonline.org|accessdate=7 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; As of 2015, it is a four-day event that includes concerts, workshops, comedy, theatre, films and writing events that "promote and affirm the creative talents and technical skills of women" from diverse, multicultural communities, including women with disabilities. While most attendees are women, men can attend.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wiaonline.org/wia/membership-and-donation/|title=Membership and Contributions - National Womens Music Festival|website=Wiaonline.org|accessdate=7 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Michigan Womyn's Music Festival]] was created in 1976, and became the largest festival in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;Morris 1999:28&lt;/ref&gt;

An example of a festival that focuses on music is the Women in Music Festival held by the [[University of Rochester]]'s [[Eastman School of Music]]. The festival began in 2005 as a celebration of the contributions of women to composition, performance, teaching, scholarship, and music administration.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.esm.rochester.edu/wmf|title=Women in Music Festival|website=Women in Music Festival|accessdate=7 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; From its modest beginnings of Eastman students and faculty members performing music by women composers, the Festival has grown to include additional concerts and events throughout Rochester, NY and to host composers-in-residence, who have included [[Tania León]] (2007), [[Nancy Van de Vate]] (2008), [[Judith Lang Zaimont]] (2009), [[Emma Lou Diemer]] (2010), and [[Hilary Tann]] (2011). The festival has presented more than 291 different works by 158 composers.

Many other festivals have been created throughout the United States and Canada since the mid-1970s and vary in size from a few hundred to thousands of attendees. The [[Los Angeles Women's Music Festival]] began in 2007 with over 2500 attendees.  Events outside the US include the Sappho Lesbian Witch Camp, near Vancouver, British Columbia in Canada and the Sistajive Women's Music Festival in Australia. Some festivals are focused around the lesbian community, such as the Ohio Lesbian Festival, near Columbus Ohio, which was created in 1988; Christian Lesbians Out (CLOUT), which holds a gathering in early August in Washington, DC; The Old Lesbian Gathering, a festival in Minneapolis, Minnesota; and RadLesFes, an event held in the middle of November near Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. Feminist-oriented festivals include the Southern Womyn's Festival in Dade City, Florida; the Gulf Coast Womyn's Festival in Ovett, Missouri; Wiminfest in Albuquerque, New Mexico; Womongathering, the Festival of Womyn's Spirituality; the Michigan Womyn's Music Festival, near Hart, Michigan; and the Midwest Womyn's Festival in DeKalb, Illinois.

While women's music festivals are centered on music, they support many other facets of [[lesbian]] and [[feminist]] culture.  Some festivals are designed to provide a [[safe space]] for women's music and culture. Many festivals are held on college campuses or in remote rural locations, where attendees stay in campsites. Many festivals offer workshops on arts, crafts, fitness, and athletic events that women may not be able find in mainstream culture.  In her book ''Eden Built by Eves'', Bonnie Morris describes how women's music festivals serve women throughout the stages of their lives. Since the festivals are organized by women, for women, daycare and childcare facilities are typically provided. Festivals often provide a safe space for [[coming of age]] rituals for young women, adult romance and commitment ceremonies, the expression of alternative perspectives on motherhood, and the expression of grief and loss.&lt;ref&gt;Morris 1999&lt;/ref&gt;

====Lilith Fair====
[[File:Sarah McLachlan 29 July 2010.jpg|thumb|right|160px|[[Lilith Fair]] co-founder [[Sarah McLachlan]]]]
[[Lilith Fair]] was a [[concert tour]] and travelling music festival that consisted solely of female solo artists and female-led bands. It was founded by Canadian musician [[Sarah McLachlan]], [[Nettwerk Music Group]]'s [[Dan Fraser]] and [[Terry McBride (CEO)|Terry McBride]], and New York talent agent Marty Diamond. It took place during the summers of 1997 to 1999, and was revived in the summer of 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=128588089 |title=With Sales Lagging, Lilith Fair Faces Question of Relevance |last=Pellegrinelli |first=Lara |date=19 July 2010 |website=NPR |access-date=30 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
McLachlan organized the festival after she became frustrated with concert promoters and radio stations that refused to feature two female musicians in a row.&lt;ref name="cnn072898"&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.cnn.com/SHOWBIZ/Music/9807/28/lilith.fair/ | title=Lilith Fair: Lovely, lively and long overdue | first=Donna | last=Freydkin | publisher=CNN | date=28 July 1998 | accessdate=2008-07-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bucking conventional industry wisdom, she booked a successful tour for herself and [[Paula Cole]]. At least one of their appearances together – in McLachlan's home town, on 14 September 1996 – went by the name "Lilith Fair" and included performances by McLachlan, Cole, [[Lisa Loeb]] and [[Michelle McAdorey]], formerly of [[Crash Vegas]].

The next year, McLachlan founded the Lilith Fair tour, taking ''Lilith'' from the medieval Jewish legend that [[Lilith]] was [[Adam and Eve|Adam]]'s first wife. In 1997, Lilith Fair garnered a $16&amp;nbsp;million gross, making it the top-grossing of any touring festival.&lt;ref name="cnn072898"/&gt; Among all concert tours for that year, it was the 16th highest grossing.&lt;ref name="cnn072898"/&gt;
The festival received several pejorative nicknames, including "Breast-fest", "Girlapalooza", and "Clam Jam".&lt;ref&gt;[http://chronicle.augusta.com/stories/071698/fea_lilith.shtml]{{dead link|date=May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.glbtq.com/arts/music_popular,5.html |title=ARTS : Music: Popular |publisher=Glbtq.com |date= |accessdate=2014-05-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;
