'''Abstraction''' in [[mathematics]] is the process of extracting the underlying [[essence]] of a mathematical concept, removing any dependence on real world objects with which it might originally have been connected, and generalizing it so that it has wider applications or matching among other abstract descriptions of equivalent [[phenomena]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Bertrand Russell]], in ''The Principles of Mathematics'' Volume 1 (pg 219), refers to "the [[principle of abstraction]]".&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Robert B. Ash. A Primer of Abstract Mathematics. Cambridge University Press, Jan 1, 1998&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The New American Encyclopedic Dictionary. Edited by Edward Thomas Roe, Le Roy Hooker, Thomas W. Handford. Pg [https://books.google.com/books?id=KhQLAQAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA34 34]&lt;/ref&gt; Two of the most highly abstract areas of modern mathematics are [[category theory]] and [[model theory]].

==Description==

Many areas of mathematics began with the study of real world problems, before the underlying rules and concepts were identified and defined as [[abstract structure]]s. For example, geometry has its origins in the calculation of distances and areas in the real world; algebra started with methods of solving problems in [[arithmetic]].

Abstraction is an ongoing process in mathematics and the historical development of many mathematical topics exhibits a progression from the concrete to the abstract. Take the historical development of geometry as an example; the first steps in the abstraction of geometry were made by the ancient Greeks, with [[Euclid's Elements]] being the earliest extant documentation of the axioms of plane geometry—though Proclus tells of an earlier [[Axiomatic system|axiomatisation]] by [[Hippocrates of Chios]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www-gap.dcs.st-and.ac.uk/~history/Extras/Proclus_history_geometry.html Proclus' Summary] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150923114020/http://www-gap.dcs.st-and.ac.uk/~history/Extras/Proclus_history_geometry.html |date=2015-09-23 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 17th century [[Descartes]] introduced [[Cartesian co-ordinates]] which allowed the development of [[analytic geometry]]. Further steps in abstraction were taken by [[Lobachevsky]], [[Bolyai]], [[Riemann]], and [[Carl Friedrich Gauss|Gauss]] who generalised the concepts of geometry to develop [[non-Euclidean geometry|non-Euclidean geometries]]. Later in the 19th century mathematicians generalised geometry even further, developing such areas as geometry in [[N-dimensional space|n dimension]]s, [[projective geometry]], [[affine geometry]] and [[finite geometry]]. Finally [[Felix Klein]]'s "[[Erlangen program]]" identified the underlying theme of all of these geometries, defining each of them as the study of [[Invariant (mathematics)|properties invariant]] under a given group of [[Symmetry|symmetries]]. This level of abstraction revealed connections between geometry and [[abstract algebra]].

The advantages of abstraction are :

* It reveals deep connections between different areas of mathematics.
* Known results in one area can suggest conjectures in a related area.
* Techniques and methods from one area can be applied to prove results in a related area.

One disadvantage of abstraction is that highly abstract concepts can be difficult to learn.&lt;ref&gt;"... introducing pupils to abstract mathematics is not an easy task and requires a long-term effort that must take into account the variety of the contexts in which mathematics is used", P.L. Ferrari, ''Abstraction in Mathematics'', Phil. Trans. R. Soc. Lond. B 29 July 2003 vol. 358 no. 1435 1225-1230&lt;/ref&gt; A degree of [[mathematical maturity]] and experience may be needed for [[Assimilation (psychology)|conceptual assimilation]] of abstractions. One of the underlying principles of the [[Montessori education|Montessori]] approach to mathematics education is encouraging children to move from concrete examples to abstract thinking.&lt;ref&gt;[http://montessoritraining.blogspot.co.uk/2008/07/montessori-philosophy-moving-from.html Montessori Philosophy: Moving from Concrete to Abstract], North American Montessori Center&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Bertrand Russell]], in ''The Scientific Outlook'' (1931), writes that "Ordinary language is totally unsuited for expressing what physics really asserts, since the words of everyday life are not sufficiently abstract. Only mathematics and mathematical logic can say as little as the physicist means to say."

'''Access to public information''' and '''[[freedom of information]] (FOI)''' refer to the right of access to information held by public bodies also known as "right to know". Access to public information is considered of fundamental importance for the effective functioning of democratic systems, as it enhances governments' and public officials' accountability, boosting people participation and allowing their informed participation into public life. The fundamental premise of the right of access to public information is that the information held by governmental institutions is in principle public and may be concealed only on the basis of legitimate reasons which should be detailed in the law.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.unesco.org/new/en/communication-and-information/freedom-of-expression/freedom-of-information Freedom of Information, UNESCO. {{Retrieved|access-date=2016-10-16}}]&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Slovenia]], access to public information is guaranteed by Article 39 of the Constitution that protects freedom of speech and right of access to public information. The constitutional right of access to public information is embodied in the Access to Public Information Act adopted in 2004. In Slovenia everyone has the right to obtain information of a public nature in which he/she has a well grounded legal interest under the law, with the only exceptions provided by law. The Access to Public Information Act also enables every citizen to enjoy the right enshrined by Article 44 of the Constitution to actively participate in the management of public affairs.&lt;ref name=DP-RS&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.dp-rs.si/en/public_information/ |title=Public Information |last= |first= |date= |website=Dp-rs.si |publisher=Republic of Slovenia. state Attorney's Office |access-date=16 February 2017 |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legal framework==
Slovenia has a good regulatory framework on access to public information.&lt;ref name=ASPA&gt;{{cite journal |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date=2013 |title=Building Good Governance by Access to Information in Administrative Matters - Trends in Slovenia, Croatia and Serbia |url=http://www.nispa.org/files/conferences/2013/papers/ASPA-NewOrleans-March-13-Right-to-info-KovacPolonca.pdf  |journal=ASPA Conference, New Orleans, March 2013. NISPAcee panel, Openness and accountability in CEE: building sustainable governance? |access-date= 16 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Slovenia's Access to Information Law is considered as one of the best in Europe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.access-info.org/decision-making-transparency/legal-analysis |title=The RTI Map |last= |first= |date= |website=Access-info.org |publisher=Access-Info Europe |access-date=17 February 2017|quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Slovenian Constitution, adopted in 1991, for the first time legally defined a right to access to public information.&lt;ref name=avosetta&gt;{{cite journal |author=Rajko Knez |date=2015 |title=Free Access to environmental information. Report - Slovenia |url=http://avosetta.jura.uni-bremen.de/repslovenia2015.pdf |journal=Avosetta Annual Meeting on 29/30 May 2015 in Bremen |access-date= 10 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Slovenia access to public information is regulated by the '''Access to Public Information Act (2004)''', the Decree on communication and re-use of information of a public nature (2005) and the decree amending it (2007), and the Information Commissioner Act (2005).&lt;ref name=DP-RS/&gt;

The aim of the Slovenian Access to Public Information Act is to ensure that the work of public bodies is open and transparent and to enable natural and legal entities to exercise their rights to obtain public information from public authorities holding such information. In order to achieve this aim, the law prescribes that public authorities have to obligation to inform the public about their work to the greatest extend possible.&lt;ref name=DP-RS/&gt;

The law defines the information to be considered as "public" stipulating that public information subject to access to information law refers to information and data originating from the field of work of public authorities, regardless of its form or origin.&lt;ref name=DP-RS/&gt;

Exceptions to the rule of disclosure are defined in Article 6 of the Law. Reasons for refusing can be due to the sensitive nature of the information requested, for instance information defined as classified pursuant the Act governing classified data, or information concerning personal data, or when disclosure of such information would prejudice the implementation of a judicial or administrative procedure.&lt;ref name=DP-RS/&gt;

Public authorities are obliged to provide access to information both to Slovenian and foreign nationals, including the foreign media.&lt;ref name=EBRD&gt;{{cite journal |date=2014 |title=Commercial laws of Slovenia. An assessment by the EBRD
|url=http://www.ebrd.com/documents/legal-reform/slovenia-country-law-assessment.pdf |publisher=European Bank for Reconstruction and Development|access-date= 16 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Relevant bodies have to make a decision on a FOI request within 20 business days: this term may be extended to a maximum of 30 business days in case of requests requiring a complex compilation of the documents sought. In case a response is not provided within the designed period of time the application is considered refused and the applicant may file a complaint with the [[Information commissioner|Information Commissioner]].&lt;ref name=EBRD/&gt;

In 2005, the Information Commissioner Act established the institution of the Information Commissioner, an autonomous and independent body in charge of supervising the protection of personal data and the access to public information. The Commissioner is appointed by the National Assembly at the proposal of the President of the Republic.&lt;ref name=Slovenia.si&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sloveniatimes.com/officials-stress-importance-of-access-to-public-information |title=Officials Stress Importance of Access to Public Information |last= |first= |date=29 September 2015 |website=Sloveniatimes.com |publisher=The Slovenia Times |access-date=16 February 2017 |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Access to public information in practice==
{{Expand section|date=February 2017}}

When the right of access to public information was first introduced into the Constitution, most of Slovenians were not aware of this right. According to some experts, it tooks a decade for the right to be known, accepted and used by citizens of Slovenia.&lt;ref name=avosetta/&gt; The right of access to public information is most widely used by journalists and NGOs, while citizens are requesting public information under the FOI law more and more frequently.&lt;ref name=avosetta/&gt;

On the occasion of the [[International Right to Know Day]] celebrated on September 28th 2015, Information Commissioner Mojce Prelesnik highlighted that a key problem affecting the right of access to public information in Slovenia is the failure of state institutions to store certain data, which is particularly problematic in fields such as environmental protection, healthy food and consumer protection.&lt;ref name=Slovenia.si/&gt;

'''Activity theory''' ('''AT'''; {{lang-ru|link=no|Теория деятельности}})&lt;ref&gt;aka [[Cultural-Historical Activity Theory (CHAT)|Cultural-Historical Activity Theory]]&lt;/ref&gt; is an [[umbrella term]] for a line of eclectic social sciences theories and research with its roots in the Soviet psychological activity theory pioneered by [[Lev Vygotsky]]&lt;ref name="bioBook"&gt;Yasnitsky, A. (2018). [https://www.routledge.com/Vygotsky-An-Intellectual-Biography/Yasnitsky/p/book/9781138806740 Vygotsky: An Intellectual Biography]. London and New York: Routledge [http://individual.utoronto.ca/yasnitsky/texts/Yasnitsky_2018_Vygotsky_bookPreview.pdf BOOK PREVIEW]&lt;/ref&gt; , [[Aleksei N. Leontiev|Alexei Leont'ev]] and [[Sergei Rubinstein]]. These scholars sought to understand human activities as [[Systems thinking|systemic]] and socially situated phenomena and to go beyond paradigms of reflexology (the teaching of [[Vladimir Bekhterev]] and his followers) and [[classical conditioning]] (the teaching of [[Ivan Pavlov]] and his school), [[psychoanalysis]] and [[behaviorism]]. It became one of the major psychological approaches in the former [[USSR]], being widely used in both theoretical and applied psychology, and in education, [[professional training]], [[ergonomics]], [[social psychology]] and [[work psychology]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Bedney|Meister|1997}}

{{cite book |last1=Bedny |first1=Gregory |last2=Meister |first2=David |title=The Russian Theory of Activity: Current Applications To Design and Learning |series=Series in Applied Psychology |year=1997 |publisher=Psychology Press |isbn=978-0-8058-1771-3 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Activity theory is more of a descriptive meta-theory or framework than a predictive theory. It considers an entire work/activity system (including teams, organizations, etc.) beyond just one actor or user. It accounts for environment, history of the person, culture, role of the artifact, motivations, and complexity of real-life activity. One of the strengths of AT is that it bridges the gap between the individual subject and the social reality—it studies both through the mediating activity. The unit of analysis in AT is the concept of object-oriented, collective and culturally mediated human activity, or ''activity system''. This system includes the object (or objective), subject, mediating artifacts (signs and tools), rules, community and division of labor. The motive for the activity in AT is created through the tensions and contradictions within the elements of the system.&lt;ref name="Perspectives on Activity Theory"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Engeström |first1=Yrjö |last2=Miettinen |first2=Reijo |last3=Punamäki |first3=Raija-Leena |title=Perspectives on Activity Theory |year=1999 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |isbn=978-0-521-43730-1 }}&lt;/ref&gt; According to ethnographer [[Bonnie Nardi]], a leading theorist in AT, activity theory "focuses on practice, which obviates the need to distinguish 'applied' from 'pure' science—understanding everyday practice in the real world is the very objective of scientific practice. ... The object of activity theory is to understand the unity of consciousness and activity."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Nardi |first=Bonnie |title=Context and Consciousness: Activity Theory and Human-Computer Interaction |year=1995 |publisher=MIT Press |isbn=978-0-262-14058-4 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Sometimes called "Cultural-Historical Activity Theory", this approach is particularly useful for studying a group that exists "largely in virtual form, its communications mediated largely through electronic and printed texts."&lt;ref&gt;Foot, K. (2001).  Cultural-Historical Activity Theory as Practical Theory: Illuminating the Development of a Conflict Monitoring Network. Communication Theory, 11(1), 56–83. {{doi|10.1111/j.1468-2885.2001.tb00233.x}} http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1468-2885.2001.tb00233.x/abstract&lt;/ref&gt;

AT is particularly useful as a lens in qualitative research methodologies (e.g., [[ethnography]], [[case study]]). AT provides a method of understanding and analyzing a phenomenon, finding patterns and making inferences across interactions, describing phenomena and presenting phenomena through a built-in language and rhetoric. A particular activity is a goal-directed or purposeful interaction of a subject with an object through the use of tools. These tools are exteriorized forms of mental processes manifested in constructs, whether physical or psychological. AT recognizes the internalization and externalization of cognitive processes involved in the use of tools, as well as the transformation or development that results from the interaction.&lt;ref&gt;Fjeld, M., Lauche, K., Bichsel, M., Voorhorst, F., Krueger, H., Rauterberg, M. (2002): Physical and Virtual Tools: Activity Theory Applied to the Design of Groupware. In B. A. Nardi &amp; D. F. Redmiles (eds.) A Special Issue of Computer Supported Cooperative Work (CSCW): Activity Theory and the Practice of Design, Volume 11 (1–2), pp. 153–180.&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The origins of activity theory can be traced to several sources, which have subsequently given rise to various complementary and intertwined strands of development. This account will focus on three of the most important of these strands. The first is associated with the [[Moscow Institute of Psychology]] and in particular the "troika" of young Russian researchers, [[Vygotsky Circle|Vygotsky, Leont'ev and Luria]]. Vygotsky founded cultural-historical psychology, a field that became the basis for modern AT; Leont'ev, one of the principal founders of activity theory, both developed and reacted against Vygotsky's work. Leont'ev's formulation of general activity theory is currently the most influential in post-Soviet developments in AT, which have largely been in social-scientific, organizational, and writing-studies rather than psychological research.{{Citation needed|date=March 2012}}

The second major line of development within activity theory involves Russian scientists, such as [[P. K. Anokhin]] and [[Nikolai Bernstein]], more directly concerned with the neurophysiological basis of activity; its foundation is associated with the Soviet philosopher of psychology [[Sergei Rubinstein]]. This work was subsequently developed by researchers such as Pushkin, Zinchenko &amp; Gordeeva, Ponomarenko, Zarakovsky and others, and is currently most well-known through the work on systemic-structural activity theory being carried out by [[G. Z. Bedny]] and his associates.{{Citation needed|date=March 2012}}

Finally, in the Western world, discussions and use of AT are primarily framed within the Scandinavian activity theory strand, developed by [[Yrjö Engeström]].

===Russian===
After Vygotsky's early death, Leont'ev became the leader of the research group nowadays known as the [[Kharkov School of Psychology]] and extended Vygotsky's research framework in significantly new ways. Leont'ev first examined the [[comparative psychology|psychology of animals]], looking at the different degrees to which animals can be said to have mental processes. He concluded that Pavlov's reflexionism was not a sufficient explanation of animal behaviour and that animals have an active relation to reality, which he called "activity". In particular, the behaviour of higher primates such as chimpanzees could only be explained by the ape's formation of multi-phase plans using tools.{{Citation needed|date=March 2012}}

Leont'ev then progressed to humans and pointed out that people engage in "actions" that do not in themselves satisfy a need, but contribute towards the eventual satisfaction of a need. Often, these actions only make sense in a social context of a shared work activity. This led him to a distinction between "activities", which satisfy a need, and the "actions" that constitute the activities. Leont'ev also argued that the activity in which a person is involved is reflected in their mental activity, that is (as he puts it) material reality is "presented" to consciousness, but only in its vital meaning or significance.{{Citation needed|date=March 2012}}

Activity theory also influenced the development of [[organizational-activity game]] as developed by [[Georgy Shchedrovitsky]].&lt;ref name=Kerr&gt;{{cite web|last=Kerr|first=Stephen|title=Why Vygotsky?|url=http://faculty.washington.edu/stkerr/whylsv.html|publisher=[[University of Washington]]|accessdate=5 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Scandinavian===
AT remained virtually unknown outside the Soviet Union until the mid-1980s, when it was picked up by Scandinavian researchers. The first international conference on activity theory was not held until 1986. The earliest non-Soviet paper cited by Nardi is a 1987 paper by Yrjö Engeström: "Learning by expanding". This resulted in a reformulation of AT. Kuutti notes that the term "activity theory" "can be used in two senses: referring to the original Soviet tradition or referring to the international, multi-voiced community applying the original ideas and developing them further."&lt;ref name="Perspectives on Activity Theory"/&gt;

The Scandinavian AT school of thought seeks to integrate and develop concepts from [[Vygotsky]]'s [[Cultural-historical psychology]] and Leont'ev's activity theory with Western intellectual developments such as [[Cognitive Science]], [[American Pragmatism]], [[Constructivism (psychological school)|Constructivism]], and [[Actor-Network Theory]]. It is known as Scandinavian activity theory. Work in the systems-structural theory of activity is also being carried on by researchers in the US and UK.

Some of the changes are a systematisation of Leont'ev's work. Although Leont'ev's exposition is clear and well structured, it is not as well-structured as the formulation by Yrjö Engeström. Kaptelinin remarks that Engeström "proposed a scheme of activity different from that by Leont'ev; it contains three interacting entities—the individual, the object and the community—instead of the two components—the individual and the object—in Leont'ev's original scheme."&lt;ref&gt;Kaptelinin 1996, p. 57&lt;/ref&gt;

Some changes were introduced, apparently by importing notions from [[human–computer interaction]] theory. For instance, the notion of ''rules'', which is not found in Leont'ev, was introduced. Also, the notion of collective subject was introduced in the 1970s and 1980s (Leont'ev refers to "joint labour activity", but only has individuals, not groups, as activity subjects).

==Theory==
[[File:Activity system.png|thumb|Activity system diagram]]The goal of activity theory is understanding the mental capabilities of a single individual. However, it rejects the ''isolated'' individuals as insufficient [[unit of analysis]], analyzing the cultural and technical aspects of [[social action|human action]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1 =Bertelsen|first1= Olav W. |first2 = Susanne|last2= Bødker|author2-link= Susanne Bødker |date = 2003 |chapter = Chapter 11: Activity Theory |chapterurl=https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/794e/762dc34936f768454b56bbafd9c18eb84cfa.pdf|title = HCI Models, Theories, and Framewors: Toward an Interdisciplinary Science|editor-last = Carroll|editor-first = J.M.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Activity theory is most often used to describe actions in a [[Sociotechnical systems|socio-technical system]] through six related elements (Bryant et al. as defined by Leonti'ev 1981 and redefined in Engeström 1987) of a conceptual system expanded by more nuanced theories:
* Object-orientedness – the objective of the activity system. Object refers to the objectiveness of the reality; items are considered objective according to natural sciences but also have social and cultural properties.
* Subject or internalization – actors engaged in the activities; the traditional notion of mental processes
* Community or externalization – social context; all actors involved in the activity system
* Tools or tool mediation – the artifacts (or concepts) used by actors in the system. Tools influence actor-structure interactions, they change with accumulating experience. In addition to physical shape, the knowledge also evolves. Tools are influenced by culture, and their use is a way for the accumulation and transmission of social knowledge. Tools influence both the agents and the structure.
* [[Division of labor]] – social strata, hierarchical structure of activity, the division of activities among actors in the system
* Rules – conventions, guidelines and rules regulating activities in the system

Activity theory helps explain how [[social artifact]]s and [[social organization]] mediate social action (Bryant et al.).

==Information systems==
The application of activity theory to information systems derives from the work of Bonnie Nardi and [[Kari Kuutti]]. Kuutti's work is addressed below. Nardi's approach is, briefly, as follows: Nardi (p.&amp;nbsp;6) described activity theory as "...a powerful and clarifying descriptive tool rather than a strongly predictive theory. The object of activity theory is to understand the unity of consciousness and activity...Activity theorists argue that consciousness is not a set of discrete disembodied cognitive acts (decision making, classification, remembering), and certainly it is not the brain; rather, consciousness is located in everyday practice: you are what you do."&lt;ref name="Nardi, B. A. 1996 pp. 1-8"&gt;Nardi, B. A. (1996). Activity theory and human computer interaction In B. A. Nardi (Ed.), Context and Consciousness: Activity Theory and Human-Computer Interaction (pp. 1–8). Cambridge, Massachusetts: The MIT Press.&lt;/ref&gt;  Nardi (p.&amp;nbsp;5) also argued that "activity theory proposes a strong notion of ''mediation''—all human experience is shaped by the tools and sign systems we use." &lt;ref name="Nardi, B. A. 1996 pp. 1-8"/&gt; Nardi (p.&amp;nbsp;6) explained that "a basic tenet of activity theory is that a notion of consciousness is central to a depiction of activity. Vygotsky described consciousness as a phenomenon that unifies attention, intention, memory, reasoning, and speech..."&lt;ref name="Nardi, B. A. 1996 pp. 1-8"/&gt; and (p.&amp;nbsp;7) "Activity theory, with its emphasis on the importance of motive and consciousness—which belongs only to humans—sees people and things as fundamentally different. People are not reduced to 'nodes' or 'agents' in a system; 'information processing' is not seen as something to be modelled in the same way for people and machines."&lt;ref name="Nardi, B. A. 1996 pp. 1-8"/&gt;

In a later work, Nardi et al. in comparing activity theory with cognitive science, argue that "activity theory is above all a social theory of consciousness" and therefore "... activity theory wants to define consciousness, that is, all the mental functioning including
remembering, deciding, classifying, generalising, abstracting and so forth, as a product of our social interactions with other people and of our use of tools."{{Citation needed|date=March 2010}} For Activity Theorists "consciousness" seems to refer to any mental functioning, whereas most other approaches to psychology distinguish conscious from unconscious functions.

Over the last 15 years the use and exploration of activity theory in information systems has grown.&lt;ref&gt;Ditsa, G. (2003). Activity theory as a theoretical foundation for information systems research Information management (pp. 192–231): IGI Publishing.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Chen, R., Sharman, R., Rao, H. R., &amp; Upadhyaya, S. J. (2013). Data Model Development for Fire Related Extreme Events: An Activity Theory Approach. MIS Quarterly, in press.&lt;/ref&gt; One stream of research has focused on technology mediated change and the implementation of technologies and how they disrupt, change and improve organisational work activity. In these studies, activity systems are used to understand emergent contradictions in the work activity, which are temporarily resolved using information systems (tools) and/or arising from the introduction of information systems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1 = Allen|first1 = David K.|last2 = Brown|first2 = Andrew|last3 = Karanasios|first3 = Stan |last4 = Norman|first4 = Alistair|date = 2013|title =How should technology-mediated organizational change be explained?

In the field of ICT and development (a field of study within information systems) the use of activity theory has also been used to inform development of IT systems &lt;ref&gt;Korpela, M., Mursu, A., &amp; Soriyan, H. A. (2002). Information Systems Development as an Activity.

In addition, Etengoff &amp; Daiute have conducted recent work exploring how social media interfaces can be productively used to mediate conflicts.

==Human–computer interaction==
The rise of the personal computer challenged the focus in traditional systems developments on mainframe systems for automation of existing work routines. It furthermore brought forth a need to focus on how to work on materials and objects through the computer. In the search of theoretical and methodical perspectives suited to deal with issues of flexibility and more advanced mediation between the human being, material and outcomes through the interface, it seemed promising to turn to the still rather young HCI research tradition that had emerged primarily in the US (for further discussion see Bannon &amp; Bødker, 1991).

Specifically the cognitive science-based theories lacked means of addressing a number of issues that came out of the empirical projects (see Bannon &amp; Bødker, 1991): 1. Many of the early advanced user interfaces assumed that the users were the designers themselves, and accordingly built on an assumption of a generic user, without concern for qualifications, work environment, division of work, etc. 2.In particular the role of the artifact as it stands between the user and her materials, objects and outcomes was ill understood. 3. In validating findings and designs there was a heavy focus on novice users whereas everyday use by experienced users and concerns for the development of expertise were hardly addressed. 4.Detailed task analysis and the idealized models created through task analysis failed to capture the complexity and contingency of real-life action. 5.From the point of view of complex work settings, it was striking how most HCI focused on one user – one computer in contrast to the ever-ongoing cooperation and coordination of real work situations (this problem later lead to the development of CSCW). 6.Users were mainly seen as objects of study.{{Citation needed|date=March 2012}}

Because of these shortcomings, it was necessary to move outside cognitive science-based HCI to find or develop the necessary theoretical platform. European psychology had taken different paths than had American with much inspiration from [[dialectical materialism]] (Hydén 1981, Engeström, 1987). Philosophers such as Heidegger and Wittgenstein came to play an important role, primarily through discussions of the limitations of AI (Winograd &amp; Flores 1986, Dreyfus &amp; Dreyfus 1986). Suchman (1987) with a similar focus introduced [[ethnomethodology]] into the discussions, and Ehn (1988) based his treatise of design of computer artifacts on Marx, Heidegger and Wittgenstein.
The development of the activity theoretical angle was primarily carried out by Bødker (1991, 1996) and by Kuutti (Bannon &amp; Kuutti, 1993, Kuutti, 1991, 1996), both with strong inspiration from Scandinavian activity theory groups in psychology. Bannon (1990, 1991) and Grudin (1990a and b) made significant contributions to the furthering of the approach by making it available to the HCI audience. The work of Kaptelinin (1996) has been important to connect to the earlier development of activity theory in Russia. Nardi produced the, hitherto, most applicable collection of activity theoretical HCI literature (Nardi, 1996).

===Systemic-structural activity theory (SSAT)===
At the end of the 1990s, a group of Russian and American activity theorists working in the systems-cybernetic tradition of Bernshtein and Anokhin began to publish English-language articles and books dealing with topics in human factors and ergonomics&lt;ref&gt;Bedny, G. Z. &amp; Meister, D. (1997). The Russian Theory of Activity: Current Applications to Design and Learning, Mahwah, NJ, Lawrence Erlbaum Associates.&lt;/ref&gt; and, latterly, human–computer interaction.&lt;ref&gt;Bedny, G. Z. &amp; Karwowski, W. (2003b). A Systemic-Structural Activity Approach to the Design of Human-Computer Interaction Tasks. International Journal of Human-Computer Interaction, 16, pp. 235–260.&lt;/ref&gt; Under the rubric of '''systemic-structural activity theory''' (SSAT), this work represents a modern synthesis within activity theory which brings together the cultural-historical and systems-structural strands of the tradition (as well as other work within Soviet psychology such as the Psychology of Set) with findings and methods from Western human factors/ergonomics and cognitive psychology.

The development of SSAT has been specifically oriented toward the analysis and design of the basic elements of human work activity: tasks, tools, methods, objects and results, and the skills, experience and abilities of involved subjects. SSAT has developed techniques for both the qualitative and quantitative description of work activity.&lt;ref&gt;Bedny, G. Z. &amp; Karwowski, W. (2006) A Systemic-Structural Theory of Activity: Applications to Human Performance and Work Design. Boca Raton, CRC Press/Taylor &amp; Francis.&lt;/ref&gt; Its design-oriented analyses specifically focus on the interrelationship between the structure and self-regulation of work activity and the configuration of its material components.

==An explanation==
This section presents a short introduction to activity theory, and some brief comments on human creativity in activity theory and the implications of activity theory for tacit knowledge and learning.

===Activities===
Activity theory begins with the notion of activity. An activity is seen as a system of human "doing" whereby a subject works on an object in order to obtain a desired outcome. In order to do this, the subject employs tools, which may be external (e.g. an axe, a computer) or internal (e.g. a plan). As an illustration, an activity might be the operation of an automated call centre. As we shall see later, many subjects may be involved in the activity and each subject may have one or more motives (e.g. improved supply management, career advancement or gaining control over a vital organisational power source). A simple example of an activity within a call centre might be a telephone operator (subject) who is modifying a customer's billing record (object) so that the billing data is correct (outcome) using a graphical front end to a database (tool).{{Citation needed|date=March 2012}}

Kuutti formulates activity theory in terms of the structure of an activity. "An activity is a form of doing directed to an object, and activities are distinguished from each other according
to their objects. Transforming the object into an outcome motivates the existence of an activity. An object can be a material thing, but it can also be less tangible."&lt;ref name="Perspectives on Activity Theory"/&gt;

Kuutti then adds a third term, the tool, which 'mediates' between the activity and the object. "The tool is at the same time both enabling and limiting: it empowers the subject in the transformation process with the historically collected experience and skill 'crystallised' to it, but it also restricts the interaction to be from the perspective of that particular tool or instrument; other potential features of an object remain invisible to the subject...".&lt;ref name="Perspectives on Activity Theory"/&gt;

As Verenikina remarks, tools are "social objects with certain modes of operation developed socially in the course of labour and are only possible because they correspond to the objectives of a practical action."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Verenikina, Irina M|title=Vygotsky in twenty-first-century research|year=2010|page=16|url=http://ro.uow.edu.au/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=2337&amp;context=edupapers}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Levels===
An activity is modelled as a three-level hierarchy.&lt;ref name="Engestrom1987"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Engeström|first1=Yrjö|title=Learning by Expanding: An Activity-theoretical Approach to Developmental Research|date=1987|publisher=Orienta-Konsultit Oy|isbn=9789519593326}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kuutti schematises processes in activity theory as a three-level system.

Verenikina paraphrases Leont'ev as explaining that "the non-coincidence of action and operations... appears in actions with tools, that is, material objects which are crystallised operations, not actions nor goals. If a person is confronted with a specific goal of, say, dismantling a machine, then they must make use of a variety of operations; it makes no difference how the individual operations were learned because the formulation of the operation proceeds differently to the formulation of the goal that initiated the action."{{Citation needed|date=March 2010}}

The levels of activity are also characterised by their purposes: "Activities are oriented to motives, that is, the objects that are impelling by themselves. Each motive is an object, material or ideal, that satisfies a need. Actions are the processes functionally subordinated to activities; they are directed at specific conscious goals... Actions are realised through operations that are determined by the actual conditions of activity."{{Citation needed|date=March 2010}}

Engeström developed an extended model of an activity, which adds another component, community ("those who share the same object"), and then adds rules to mediate between subject and community, and the division of labour to mediate between object and community.

Kuutti asserts that "These three classes should be understood broadly. A tool can be anything used in the transformation process, including both material tools and tools for thinking. Rules cover both explicit and implicit norms, conventions, and social relations within a community. Division of labour refers to the explicit and implicit organisation of the community as related to the transformation process of the object into the outcome."{{Citation needed|date=March 2010}}

Activity theory therefore includes the notion that an activity is carried out within a social context, or specifically in a community. The way in which the activity fits into the context is thus established by two resulting concepts:
* rules: these are both explicit and implicit and define how subjects must fit into the community;
* division of labour: this describes how the object of the activity relates to the community.

===The internal plane of action===
Activity theory provides a number of useful concepts that can be used to address the lack of expression for 'soft' factors which are inadequately represented by most process modelling frameworks. One such concept is the internal plane of action. Activity theory recognises that each activity takes place in two planes: the external plane and the internal plane. The external plane represents the objective components of the action while the internal plane represents the subjective components of the action. Kaptelinin defines the ''internal plane of actions'' as "[...] a concept developed in activity theory that refers to the human ability to perform manipulations with an internal representation of external objects before starting actions with these objects in reality."&lt;ref&gt;Kaptelinin 1996, p. 51&lt;/ref&gt;

The concepts of motives, goals and conditions discussed above also contribute to the modelling of soft factors. One principle of activity theory is that many activities have multiple motivation ('polymotivation'). For instance, a programmer in writing a program may address goals aligned towards multiple motives such as increasing his or her annual bonus, obtaining relevant career experience and contributing to organisational objectives.

Activity theory further argues that subjects are grouped into communities, with rules mediating between subject and community and a division of labour mediating between object and community. A subject may be part of several communities and a community, itself, may be part of other communities.

===Human creativity===
Human creativity plays an important role in activity theory, that "human beings... are essentially creative beings" in "the creative, non-predictable character". Tikhomirov also analyses the importance of ''creative activity'', contrasting it to ''routine'' activity, and notes the important shift brought about by computerisation in the balance towards creative activity.

Karl Marx, a sociological theorist, argued that humans are unique compared to other species in that humans create everything they need to survive. According to Marx, this is described as species-being. Marx believed we find our true identity in what we produce in our personal labor.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The social lens : an invitation to social and sociological theory|last=Allan|first=Kenneth|isbn=9781412992787|edition=Third|location=Thousand Oaks, CA|oclc=829099056|date = 2013-05-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Learning and tacit knowledge===
Activity theory has an interesting approach to the difficult problems of ''learning'' and, in particular, ''tacit knowledge''. Learning has been a favourite subject of management theorists, but it has often been presented in an abstract way separated from the work processes to which the learning should apply. Activity theory provides a potential corrective to this tendency. For instance, Engeström's review of Nonaka's work on ''[[knowledge management|knowledge creation]]'' suggests enhancements based on activity theory, in particular suggesting that the organisational learning process includes preliminary stages of goal and problem formation not found in Nonaka. Lompscher, rather than seeing learning as ''transmission'', sees the formation of learning goals and the
student's understanding of which things they need to acquire as the key to the formation of the learning activity.

Of particular importance to the study of learning in organisations is the problem of ''tacit knowledge'', which according to Nonaka, "is highly personal and hard to formalise, making it difficult to communicate to others or to share with others."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Nonaka |first1=Ikujiro |last2=Takeuchi |first2=Hirotaka |title=The Knowledge-Creating Company: How Japanese Companies Create the Dynamics of Innovation |year=1995 |publisher=Oxford University Press |isbn=978-0-19-509269-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Leont'ev's concept of operation provides an important insight into this problem. In addition, the key idea of ''internalisation'' was originally introduced by Vygotsky as "the internal reconstruction of an external operation."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Mind in society: The development of higher psychological processes.|last=Vygotsky|first=L. S.|publisher=Harvard University Press|year=1978|isbn=978-0-674-57628-5|location=Cambridge, MA|pages=56}}&lt;/ref&gt; Internalisation has subsequently become a key term of the theory of tacit knowledge and has been defined as "a process of embodying explicit knowledge into tacit knowledge."{{Citation needed|date=March 2010}} Internalisation has been described by Engeström as the "key psychological mechanism" discovered by Vygotsky and is further discussed by Verenikina.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10260">In the [[psychoanalysis]] of [[Sigmund Freud]], '''afterwardsness''' is a "mode of belated understanding or retroactive attribution of sexual or traumatic meaning to earlier events... [from the German word] ''Nachträglichkeit'', translated as deferred action, retroaction, [[:fr:après-coup|après-coup]], afterwardsness".&lt;ref&gt;Teresa de Lauretis, ''Freud's Drive: Psychoanalysis, Literature and Film'' (Basingstoke 2008), p. 118&lt;/ref&gt; As summarized by another scholar, 'In one sense, Freud's theory of deferred action can be simply stated: memory is reprinted, so to speak, in accordance with later experience'.&lt;ref&gt;Adam Phillips, ''On Flirtation'' (London 1994), p. 33&lt;/ref&gt;

==History and development of the term==

===Freud===
The psychoanalytical concept of "afterwardsness" ({{lang-de|Nachträglichkeit}}) appeared initially in [[Freud]]'s writings in the 1890s in the commonsense form of the German adjective-adverb "afterwards" or "deferred" (''nachträglich''): as Freud wrote in the unfinished and unpublished "A Project for a Scientific Psychology" of 1895, 'a memory is repressed which has only become a trauma ''after the event'' '.&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in Jean Laplanche, ''Life and Death in Psychoanalysis'' (London 1976), p. 41&lt;/ref&gt; However the 'theory of deferred action had already been [publicly] put forward by Freud in the ''Studies on Hysteria'' (1895)',&lt;ref&gt;Sigmund Freud, ''Case Histories II'' (London 1991), p. 278n&lt;/ref&gt; and in a paper of 1896 'he elaborates on the idea of ''deferred action'': the pathogenic effect of a traumatic event occurring in childhood...[manifesting] retrospectively when the child reaches a subsequent phase of sexual development'.&lt;ref&gt;Jean-Michel Quinodoz, ''Reading Freud'' (London 2006), p. 34&lt;/ref&gt;

The same idea would feature prominently a couple of decades later in his study of the "Wolf Man": 'The effects of the scene were deferred, but...had the same effect as though it were a recent experience'.&lt;ref&gt;Sigmund Freud, ''Case Histories II'' (London 1991), pp. 276–7&lt;/ref&gt; 'Thus although he never offered a definition, much less a general theory, of the notion of deferred action, it was indisputably looked on by Freud as part of his conceptual equipment'.&lt;ref&gt;Jean Laplanche and J.-B. Pontalis, in Adam Phillips, ''On Flirtation'' (London 1994), p. 33&lt;/ref&gt;

===Lacan===
It was [[Jacques Lacan|Lacan]] who brought the term back from obscurity after Freud's death—his translation in the French language as the "[[:fr:après-coup|après-coup]]" fits into the context of his "return to Freud" ("rapport de Rome", 1953)—and certainly French [[psychoanalysis]] has since taken the lead in its explication. Lacan himself claimed in his Seminar that "the real implication of the ''nachträglich'', for example, has been ignored, though it was there all the time and had only to be picked up,"&lt;ref&gt;Jacques Lacan, ''The Four Fundamental Concepts of Psycho-Analysis'' (London 1994), p. 216&lt;/ref&gt; while writing in Ecrits of "'deferred action' (''Nachtrag''), to rescue another of these terms from the facility into which they have since fallen...they were unheard of at that time."&lt;ref&gt;Jacques Lacan, ''Ecrits: A Selection'' (London 1996), p. 281&lt;/ref&gt;

===Jean Laplanche===
After Lacan's ''après-coup'',  [[Jean Laplanche]]’s contribution to the concept of the afterwardsness signifies something very  different:&lt;ref&gt;See particularly: [[Jean Laplanche]], "Sa reviviscence en France", "Chez Lacan avec [[Heidegger]]" in: Jean Laplanche, ''Problématiques VI. L'après-coup'', Paris, PUF, 2006, p. 16-22.&lt;/ref&gt; with Jean Laplanche and in the relation to Freud (theory of the seduction, ''neurotica''), Lacan's "Other" loses its capital letter of the "[[The Symbolic|Symbolic]]", that links [[Jacques Lacan|Lacan]] to French [[structuralism]] ([[Saussure]]'s [[linguistics]], [[Lévi-Strauss]]'s [[ethnology]]), and that links also Lacan ''afterwards'' in the history of the ideas (from the 1960s on)—by "inversion in the opposite direction" (a "destiny of the [[drive theory|drive]]" in psychoanalytic theory)—to the [[:fr:French theory|French theory]] at the place of [[Jacques Derrida]]'s [[deconstruction]].&lt;ref&gt;Roseline Bonnellier, "De ''[[Hölderlin]] et la question du père'' à la ''[[:fr:théorie de la séduction généralisée|théorie de la séduction généralisée]]'' de [[:fr:Jean Laplanche|Jean Laplanche]]: Avancée paradoxale de la traduction d’''Œdipe'' en psychanalyse ", thèse du Doctorat de psychologie, Université Paris-XIII, 2007, 1050 pages&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Roseline Bonnellier, ''Sous le soleil de [[Hölderlin]]: Oedipe en question - Au premier temps du complexe était la fille'', Paris, L'Harmattan, Collection "Études psychanalytiques" (dirigée par Alain Brun et Joël Bernat), février 2010, 360 pages, {{ISBN|978-2-296-10411-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

"Afterwardsness"  becomes the key concept in Laplanche’s "[[theory of the general seduction]]" (''[[:fr:théorie de la séduction généralisée|théorie de la séduction généralisée]]'') and  of the corresponding importance of 'the act of ''psychic translation''... of [enigmatic] deposits by the other'&lt;ref&gt;Anthony Elliott, ''Social Theory since Freud'' (London 20040 p. 13 and p. 64.&lt;/ref&gt;—an approach which develops further Freud's letter 52/112 (to [[Wilhelm Fliess]]). In his "Notes on Afterwardsness" (1992), based on a conversation of [[Jean Laplanche]] with [[Martin Stanton]],&lt;ref&gt;''Jean Laplanche: Seduction, Translation, Drives'', A dossier compiled by John Fletcher and Martin Stanton, Translations by Martin Stanton, Psychoanalytic Forum, Institute of Contemporary Arts London, 1992, p. 217-223.  {{ISBN|0-905263-68-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; there is an excellent definition of ''afterwardsness'' in Laplanche's sense, including the category  of the ''enigmatic message'', that highlights Laplanche's contribution to [[Freud]]'s concept:
{{cquote | Freud's concept of afterwardsness contains both great richness and great ambiguity between retrogressive and progressive directions. I want to account for this problem of the directional to and fro by arguing that, right at the start, there is something that goes in the direction from the past to the future, and in the direction from the adult to the baby, which I call the implantation of the enigmatic message. This message is then retranslated following a temporal direction which is sometimes progressive and sometimes retrogressive (according to my general model of translation).&lt;ref&gt;Jean Laplanche in ''Jean Laplanche: Seduction, Translation, Drives'', A dossier compiled by John Fletcher and Martin Stanton, Translations by Martin Stanton, Psychoanalytic Forum, Institute of Contemporary Arts London, 1992, p. 222.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==Deferred obedience==
Closely related for Freud to deferred action was [[deferred obedience]]: again, 'a ''deferred'' effect...a "deferred obedience" under the influence of [[psychological repression|repression]]'.&lt;ref&gt;Sigmund Freud, ''Standard Edition X'' (London 1955), p. 35&lt;/ref&gt; Thus for instance Freud explored the different phases of a man's infantile attitude to his father: 'As long as his father was alive it showed itself in unmitigated rebelliousness and open discord, but immediately after his death it took the form of a [[neurosis]] based on abject submission and deferred obedience to him'.&lt;ref&gt;Sigmund Freud, ''Case Histories II'' (London 1991), p. 191&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''Totem and Taboo'' he generalised the principle and 'depicted the social contract also as based on posthumous obedience to the father's authority'&lt;ref&gt;Jose Bruner, ''Freud and the Politics of Psychoanalysis'' (2001), p. 161&lt;/ref&gt;—offset at times by its converse, occasional [[Carnival]]-like licence such as 'the memorial festival of the totem meal, in which the ''restrictions'' of deferred obedience no longer held'.&lt;ref&gt;[[Julia Kristeva]]/Jeanine Herman, ''The Sense and Non-Sense of Revolt'' (Columbia 2001), p. 13&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3911">'''Atomism''' or '''social atomism''' is a [[sociology|sociological]] theory arising from the scientific notion ''[[atomic theory]]'', coined by the ancient Greek philosopher [[Democritus]] and the Roman philosopher [[Lucretius]].  In the scientific rendering of the word, atomism refers to the notion that all matter in the universe is composed of basic indivisible components, or [[atom]]s. When placed into the field of sociology, atomism assigns the [[individual]] as the basic unit of analysis for all implications of social life.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language, Fourth Edition|year=2000|publisher=Houghton Mifflin Company}}&lt;/ref&gt; This theory refers to "the tendency for society to be made up of a collection of self-interested and largely self-sufficient individuals, operating as separate atoms".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Global politics|last=Macmillan.|first=Palgrave|date=2015|publisher=Palgrave Macmillan|isbn=9781137349262|oclc=979008143}}&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, all social values, institutions, developments and procedures evolve entirely out of the interests and actions of the individuals who inhabit any particular society.  The individual is the ‘atom’ of society and therefore the only true object of concern and analysis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Atomism|url=http://www.thefreedictionary.com/atomism|publisher=The Free Dictionary by Farlex|accessdate=21 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
 
==Political implications==
Political theorists such as [[John Locke]] and [[Thomas Hobbes]] extend social atomism to the political realm. They assert that human beings are fundamentally self-interested, equal and rational ''social atoms'' that together form an aggregate [[society]] of self-interested individuals. Those participating in society must sacrifice a portion of their individual [[rights]] in order to form a ''[[social contract]]'' with the other persons in society. Ultimately, although some rights are renounced, self-interested cooperation occurs for the mutual preservation of the individuals and for society at large.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Social Contract and Constitutional Republics|url=http://constitution.org/soclcont.htm|publisher=The Constitution Society|accessdate=21 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
   
==Critiques==
Those who criticize the theory of social atomism believe that it neglects the idea of the individual as unique.  Sociologist [[Elizabeth Wolgast]] asserts that,
“From the atomistic standpoint, the individuals who make up a society are interchangeable like molecules in a bucket of water--society a mere aggregate of individuals. This introduces a harsh and brutal equality into our theory of [[human behavior|human life]] and it contradicts our experience of [[human being]]s as unique and irreplaceable, valuable in virtue of their variety--in what they don't share--not in virtue of their common ability to [[reason]].”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Wolgast|first=Elizabeth|title=A World of Social Atoms|year=1994|publisher=Prentice-Hall|location=Englewood Cliffs, NJ|pages=226}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
Those who question social atomism argue that it is unjust to treat all persons equally when individual necessities and circumstances are clearly dissimilar.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Social Atomism and the Old World Order |url=http://www.panix.com/~squigle/dcp/atomism.html |publisher=T.R.

{{Marxism|Variants}}
'''Autonomism''' (also '''authonomous Marxism''' or '''autonomist Marxism''') is a set of [[anti-authoritarian]] [[left-wing]] political and social movements and theories.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.academia.edu/1342334/AUTONOMISM_AS_A_GLOBAL_SOCIAL_MOVEMENT "Autonomism as a global social movement" by Patrick Cuninghame]. ''WorkingUSA: The Journal of Labor and Society''. Volume 13 (December 2010): 451–464. {{ISSN|1089-7011}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.eroseffect.com/books/subversion_download.htm Georgy Katsiaficas.

Sylvere Lotringer &amp; Christian Marazzi. New York: Semiotext(e), 1980, 2007. {{ISBN|1-58435-053-9}}, {{ISBN|978-1-58435-053-8}}.&lt;/ref&gt; As a theoretical system, it first emerged in [[History of the Italian Republic|Italy in the 1960s]] from [[workerist]] (''[[operaismo]]'') [[communism]]. Later, [[Post-Marxism|post-Marxist]] and [[anarchist]] tendencies became significant after influence from the [[Situationist International|Situationists]], the failure of Italian [[far-left]] movements in the 1970s, and the emergence of a number of important theorists including [[Antonio Negri]], who had contributed to the 1969 founding of ''[[Potere Operaio]]'', as well as [[Mario Tronti]], [[Paolo Virno]] and [[Franco Berardi|Franco "Bifo" Berardi]].

Georgy Katsiaficas summarizes the forms of autonomous movements saying that "In contrast to the centralized decisions and [[hierarchical]] [[Anti-authoritarianism|authority]] structures of modern institutions, autonomous social movements involve people directly in decisions affecting their everyday lives. They seek to expand democracy and to help individuals break free of political structures and behavior patterns imposed from the outside."&lt;ref&gt;Georgy Katsiaficas. ''The Subversion of Politics: European Autonomous Social Movements and the Decolonization of Everyday Life''. AK Press. 2006. pg. 6&lt;/ref&gt; As such this has involved a call for the independence of social movements from political parties&lt;ref&gt;Georgy Katsiaficas. ''The Subversion of Politics: European Autonomous Social Movements and the Decolonization of Everyday Life''. AK Press. 2006. pg. 7&lt;/ref&gt; in a revolutionary perspective which seeks to create a practical political alternative to both [[State socialism|authoritarian socialism]] and contemporary [[representative democracy]].&lt;ref&gt;Georgy Katsiaficas.

Autonomism influenced the German and Dutch ''Autonomen'', the worldwide [[social centre movement]], and today is influential in Italy, France, and to a lesser extent the English-speaking countries. Those who describe themselves as autonomists now vary from Marxists to [[anarchists]].

==Etymology==
The term ''autonomia''/''Autonome'' is composed out of two Greek words: αὐτο- ''auto-'' "self" and νόμος ''nomos'', "law", hence when combined understood to mean "one who gives oneself one's own [[law]]". [[Wiktionary:autonomy|Autonomy]], in this sense, is not [[independence]]. While independence refers to an [[autarky|autarchic]] kind of life, separated from the [[community]], autonomy refers to life in society but by one's own rule. Though the notion of ''autonomism'' was alien to the ancient Greeks, the concept is indirectly endorsed by [[Aristotle]], who stated that only beasts or gods could be independent and live apart from the ''[[polis]]'' ("community"), while [[Immanuel Kant|Kant]] defined the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] by autonomy of thought and the famous ''"[[Sapere aude]]"'' ("dare to know").

==The Marxist Autonomist theory==
{{Left communism sidebar|Related}}
Unlike other forms of [[Marxism]], autonomist Marxism emphasises the ability of the [[working class]] to force changes to the organization of the [[capitalism|capitalist]] system independent of the [[State (polity)|state]], [[trade unions]] or [[political parties]]. Autonomists are less concerned with party political organization than are other Marxists, focusing instead on self-organized action outside of traditional organizational structures. Autonomist Marxism is thus a "bottom-up" theory: it draws attention to activities that autonomists see as everyday working-class resistance to capitalism, such as [[absenteeism]], slow working, socialization in the workplace, [[sabotage]], and other subversive activities.

Like other Marxists, autonomists see [[class struggle]] as being of central importance. However, autonomists have a broader definition of the working class than do other Marxists: as well as wage-earning workers (both [[White-collar worker|white collar]] and [[Blue-collar worker|blue collar]]), autonomists also include in this category the unwaged (students, the unemployed, homemakers, etc.), who are traditionally deprived of any form of union representation.

Early theorists (such as [[Mario Tronti]], [[Antonio Negri]], [[Sergio Bologna]], and [[Paolo Virno]]) developed notions of "immaterial" and "social labour" that extended the Marxist concept of labour to all society. They suggested that modern society's wealth was produced by unaccountable [[collective]] work, and that only a little of this was redistributed to the workers in the form of wages. Other Italian autonomists—particularly feminists, such as [[Mariarosa Dalla Costa]] and [[Silvia Federici]]—emphasised the importance of [[feminism]] and the value of unpaid female labour to capitalist society.

A scholar of the movement, Michael Ryan, writes that {{quote|Autonomy, as a movement and as a theory, opposes the notion that capitalism is an irrational system which can be made rational through planning. Instead, it assumes the workers' viewpoint, privileging their activity as the lever of revolutionary passage as that which alone can construct a communist society. Economics is seen as being entirely political; economic relations are direct political relations of force between class subjects. And it is in the economic category of the social worker, not in an alienated political form like the party, that the initiative for political change resides.&lt;ref&gt;Michael Ryan, "Translators' Introductions Part II," Antonio Negri, Marx beyond Marx: Lessons on the Grundrisse, New York: Autonomedia, 1991, p. xxx.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==Italian autonomism==
[[File:AntonioNegri SeminarioInternacionalMundo.jpg|upright=1.15|thumb|left|[[Antonio Negri]], a leading theorist of Italian autonomism]]
Autonomist Marxism—referred to in Italy as ''[[operaismo]]'', which translates literally as "workerism"—first appeared in Italy in the early 1960s. Arguably, the emergence of early autonomism can be traced to the dissatisfaction of automotive workers in [[Turin]] with their union, which reached an agreement with [[FIAT]]. The disillusionment of these workers with their organised representation, along with the resultant riots (in particular the 1962 riots by FIAT workers in Turin, "fatti di Piazza Statuto"), were critical factors in the development of a theory of self-organised labour representation outside the scope of traditional representatives such as [[trade union]]s.

In 1969, the ''[[operaismo]]'' approach was active mainly in two different groups: ''[[Lotta Continua]]'', led by [[Adriano Sofri]] (which had a very significant [[Roman Catholic]] cultural matrix), and ''[[Potere Operaio]]'', led by [[Antonio Negri]], [[Franco Piperno]], [[Oreste Scalzone]], and [[Valerio Morucci]]. [[Mario Capanna]] was the charismatic leader of the Milan student movement, which had a more classical [[Marxist-Leninist]] approach.

===Influences===
Through translations made available by Danilo Montaldi and others, the Italian autonomists drew upon previous activist research in the United States by the [[Johnson–Forest Tendency]] and in France by the group [[Socialisme ou Barbarie]]. The Johnson-Forest Tendency had studied working-class life and struggles within the US auto industry, publishing pamphlets such as "The American Worker" (1947), "Punching Out" (1952), and "Union Committeemen and Wildcat Strikes" (1955). That work was translated into French by Socialisme ou Barbarie and published, serially, in their journal. They too began investigating and writing about what was going on inside workplaces, in their case inside both auto factories and insurance offices.

The journal ''Quaderni Rossi'' ("Red Notebooks"), produced between 1961 and 1965, and its successor ''Classe Operaia'' ("Working Class"), produced between 1963 and 1966, were also influential in the development of early autonomism. [[Raniero Panzieri]], [[Mario Tronti]], and [[Toni Negri]] were some primary collaborators.

[[Pirate radio]] stations also were a factor in spreading autonomist ideas. [[Bologna]]'s [[Radio Alice]] was an example of such a station.

===Direct action===
{{further|Years of Lead (Italy)}}

[[File:Askatasuna torino.jpg|thumb|upright=1.2|''Askatasuna'' "autonomist" social center in [[Turin]] (2016)]]

The Italian [[student movement]], including the [[Indiani Metropolitani]] (Metropolitan Indians), starting from 1966 with the murder of student Paolo Rossi by [[neo-fascists]] at [[Sapienza University of Rome|Rome University]], engaged in various [[direct action]] operations, including riots and occupations, along with more peaceful activities such as self-reduction, in which individuals refused to pay for such services and goods as public transport, electricity, gas, rent, and food. Several clashes occurred between students and the police during the occupations of universities in the winter of 1967–68, during the [[Fiat]] occupations, and in March 1968 in Rome during the [[Battle of Valle Giulia]].

Indiani Metropolitani were a small faction active in the Italian far-left protest movement during 1976 and 1977, in the so-called "[[Years of Lead (Italy)|Years of Lead]]". The Indiani Metropolitani were the so-called 'creative' wing of the movement. Its adherents wore face-paint like the war-paint of [[Native Americans in the United States|Native Americans]] and dressed like [[hippies]]. The emphasis was on "stare insieme" (being together), spontaneity and the arts, especially music. The group was active in Rome, during the occupation of the university La Sapienza in 1977.

On 11 March 1977, riots took place in Bologna following the killing of student Francesco Lorusso by police.

Beginning in 1979, the state effectively prosecuted the autonomist movement, accusing it of protecting the [[Red Brigades]], which had kidnapped and assassinated [[Aldo Moro]]. 12,000 far-left activists were detained; 600 fled the country, including 300 to France and 200 to South America.&lt;ref&gt;{{fr icon}}[http://sebastien.schifres.free.fr/italie.htm On the Autonomist movement]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:tute bianche.jpg|thumb|upright=1.2|Members of the Italian militant social movement [[Tute Bianche]]]]

[[Tute Bianche]] was a militant Italian social movement, active from 1994 to 2001. Activists covered their bodies with padding so as to resist the blows of police, to push through police lines, and to march together in large blocks for mutual protection during [[Demonstration (people)|demonstrations]]. The tute bianche movement reached its apex during the [[27th G8 summit|anti-G8 protests in Genoa]], in July 2001, with a turn-out of an estimated 10,000 protesters in a single "padded block", ironically after a collective decision to go without the white overalls. Shortly after Genoa the Ya Basta Association disbanded, with certain segments reforming into the "Disobbedienti" which literally means "Disobedients". This philosophy includes the occupation and creation of [[Squatting|squat]]ted self-managed social centers, anti-sexist [[activism]], support for immigrant's rights and refugees seeking political asylum, as well as the process of walking together in large formations during demonstrations held in the streets, by force if necessary in case of clashes with police.

Central to the tute bianche movement was the Italian [[Ya Basta Association]], a network of groups throughout Italy that was inspired by the [[Zapatista Army of National Liberation]] uprising in Chiapas in 1994. Ya Basta primarily originated in the "autonomist" [[social centers]] of Milan, particularly [[CS Leoncavallo|Centro Sociale Leoncavallo]]. These social centers grew out of the Italian Autonomia movement of the 1970 and 80s. The tute bianches have had international variations of one sort or another. For instance, in Britain a group calling itself [[WOMBLES]] adopted the tactics, even though the political orientation of WOMBLES differed from the Italian movement. In Spain, "Mono Blanco" was the preferred identifier. The first North American variant of the tute bianche, the [[NYC Ya Basta Collective]] (based in NYC) wore yellow overalls, rather than white.

==The French ''autonome'' movement&lt;!--linked from 'Cornelius Castoriadis'--&gt;==
{{Libertarian socialism|Philosophies}}

In France, the Marxist group [[Socialisme ou Barbarie]], led by philosopher [[Cornelius Castoriadis]], could be said to be one of the first autonomist groups. Socialisme ou Barbarie drew upon the activist research of the American Johnson-Forest Tendency inside US auto plants and carried out their own investigations into rank-and-file workers struggles, struggles that were autonomous of union or party leadership.

Also parallel to the work of the Johnson-Forest Tendency, Socialisme ou Barbarie harshly criticised the [[Communist]] regime in the [[USSR]], which it considered a form of "[[bureaucratic collectivism|bureaucratic capitalism]]" and not at all the [[state socialism|socialism]] it claimed to be. Philosopher [[Jean-François Lyotard]] was also part of this movement.

However, the Italian influence of the ''operaismo'' movement was more directly felt in the creation of the review ''Matériaux pour l'intervention'' (1972–73) by Yann Moulier-Boutang, a French economist close to Toni Negri. This led in turn to the creation of the Camarades group (1974–78). Along with others, Moulier-Boutang joined the Centre International pour des Nouveaux Espaces de Liberté (CINEL), founded three years earlier by [[Félix Guattari]], and assisted Italian activists accused of terrorism, of whom at least 300 fled to France.

The French autonome mouvement organised itself in the AGPA (Assemblée Parisienne des Groupes Autonomes, "Parisian Assembly of Autonome Groups"; 1977–78). Many tendencies were present in it, including the Camarades group led by Moulier-Boutang, members of the Organisation communiste libertaire, some people referring themselves to the "Desiring Autonomy" of Bob Nadoulek, but also squatters and street-wise people (including the groupe Marge). French autonomes supported captured [[Red Army Faction]] former members. [[Jean-Paul Sartre]] also intervened on the conditions for the detention of RAF detainees.

The militant group [[Action directe (armed group)|Action directe]] appeared in 1979 and carried out several violent direct actions. Action Directe claimed responsibility for the murders of [[Renault]]'s CEO [[Georges Besse]] and General Audran. George Besse had been CEO of nuclear company [[Eurodif]]. Action Directe was dissolved in 1987.

In the 1980s, the autonomist movement underwent a deep crisis in Italy because of effective prosecution by the State, and was stronger in Germany than in France. It remained present in Parisian squats and in some riots (for example in 1980 near the [[Jussieu Campus]] in Paris, or in 1982 in the [[Ardennes (département)|Ardennes department]] during [[anti-nuclear]] demonstrations). From 1986 to 1994 the French group [[:fr:Comité des mal logés|"Comité des mal logés"]] occupied several buildings of the French national social housing authority to denounce the cruel lack of lodging for workers, they were several hundred and took their decisions in democratic assembly, with support from all autonomous groups of Paris, many of them were worked on the anti prison . In the 1980s, the French autonomists published the periodicals ''CAT Pages'' (1981–82), ''Rebelles'' (1981–93), ''Tout !'' (1982–85), ''Molotov et Confetti'' (1984), ''Les Fossoyeurs du Vieux Monde'', ''La Chôme'' (1984–85), and ''Contre'' (1987–89).

In the 1990s, the French autonomist movement was present in struggles led by unemployed people, with Travailleurs, Chômeurs, et Précaires en colère (TCP, "Angry Workers, Unemployed, and Marginalised people") and l'Assemblée générale des chômeurs de Jussieu ("General Assembly of Jussieu's unemployed people"). It was also involved in the [[alter-globalisation]] movement and above all in the solidarity with illegal foreigners (Collective Des Papiers pour tous ("Permits for all", 1996) and Collectif Anti-Expulsion (1998–2005)). Several autonomist journals date from this time: ''[[Quilombo]]'' (1988–93), ''Apache'' (1990–98), ''Tic-Tac'' (1995–97), ''Karoshi'' (1998–99), and ''Tiqqun'' (1999–2001).

From 19 to 28 July 2002, a [[No borders]] camp was made in [[Strasbourg]] to protest against anti-immigration policies, in particular inside the [[Schengen Agreement|Schengen European space]].

In 2003, autonomists came into conflict with the [[Socialist Party (France)|French Socialist Party]] (PS) during a demonstration that took place in the frame of the [[European Social Forum]] in [[Saint-Denis, Seine-Saint-Denis|Saint-Denis]] (Paris). At the end of December, hundreds of unemployed people helped themselves in the ''[[Bon Marché]]'' supermarket to be able to celebrate Christmas (an action called "''[[autoréduction]]''" (of prices) in French). [[Compagnies Républicaines de Sécurité|French riot police]] (CRS) physically opposed the unemployed people inside the shop. Autonomes rioted during the [[2006 labour protests in France|spring 2006 protests]] against the [[First Employment Contract|CPE]], and again after the [[French presidential election, 2007|2007 presidential election]] when [[Nicolas Sarkozy]] was elected.

On 11 November 2008, the French police arrested ten people, including five living in a farmhouse on a hill overlooking Tarnac, and accused them of associating with a "terrorist enterprise" by sabotaging TGV's overhead lines. Nine out of ten were let go and only [[Julien Coupat]], the alleged leader, remained in custody for about a year, charged with "directing a terrorist group" by the Paris Prosecutor's office.

==The German ''Autonome'' movement in the 1970s and 1980s==
In Germany, ''Autonome'' was used during the late 1970s to depict the most radical part of the political left.&lt;ref&gt;''FIRE AND FLAMES: A History of the German Autonomist Movement'' by Geronimo. AK Press. 2012&lt;/ref&gt; These individuals participated in practically all actions of the social movements at the time, especially in demonstrations against [[nuclear power|nuclear energy]] plants (Brokdorf 1981, Wackersdorf 1986) and in actions against the construction of airport runways (Frankfurt 1976–86). The defense of [[Squatting|squats]] against the police such as in [[Hamburg]]'s ''Hafenstraße'' was also a major "task" for the "autonome" movement. The Dutch anarchist ''Autonomen'' movement from the 1960s also concentrated on squatting.

Tactics of the "Autonome" were usually militant, including the construction of barricades or throwing stones or [[molotov cocktail]]s at the police. During their most powerful times in the early 1980s, on at least one occasion the police had to take flight.

Because of their outfit (heavy black clothing, ski masks, helmets), the "Autonome" were dubbed ''der schwarze Block'' by the German media, and in these tactics were similar to modern [[black bloc]]s. In 1989, laws regarding demonstrations in Germany were changed, prohibiting the use of so-called "passive weaponry" such as helmets or padding and covering your face.

Today, the "autonome" scene in Germany is greatly reduced and concentrates mainly on [[anti-fascist]] actions, ecology, solidarity with [[refugee]]s, and [[feminism]]. There are larger and more militant groups still in operation, such as in Switzerland or Italy.

==The Greek ''anarcho-autonomoi''&lt;!--Linked from [[Anarchism in Greece]] and [[Squatting]]; redirects here--&gt;==

{{main|Anarchism in Greece}}
In Greece, the ''anarcho-autonomoi'' (Greek αναρχο-αυτόνομοι "anarchist-autonomists") emerged as an important{{citation needed|date=November 2018}} trend in the youth and student movement, first during the 1973 [[Athens Polytechnic uprising]] against the military dictatorship that ruled the country at the time. After the collapse of the dictatorship in 1974, the "anarcho-autonomoi" became considerably influential{{citation needed|date=November 2018}}, firstly as a social trend within the youth and then as a (very loose and diverse) political trend. The definition "anarcho-autonomoi", itself, is much debated. One reason for this is that it was originally coined by opponents. However, it was also quite quickly adopted by many adherents, used as a generic term.

Before 1973, in Greece, there was very little tradition in anarchism or libertarian socialism in general. Thus, the radical Greek youth in the 1970s, having very little relative background to refer to, resided to an extensive "syncretism" of multiple trends originating in the respective movements in other European countries. Anarchist and anarcho-syndicalist trends converged with situationist, workerist, or other autonomist trends and even with radical (non-autonomist) Marxist trends. The "anarcho-autonomoi" made a very strong stand{{citation needed} during the 1978–80 student movement, coming into violent confrontation with the police and the (also, of considerable influence) Stalinist communist youth (K.N.E). Such stands were repeated whenever the student, worker, and youth movements were rising (in 1987, 1990–91, 1998–99, and 2006–7). However, their intensity has been falling since 1990–91.

Parallel to such participation in social movements, a large number of social centres (many of them squatted) exist to this day around Greece, and many of them participate in social struggles on a local level. These social centres, whether they now identify as "Autonomist" or not (most use terms such as "anti-authority" (αντιεξουσιαστής), while some identify as "anarchist" ), function in the ways that historically emerged through "Autonomia". There is also a multitude of small political groups which identify as "Autonomist", ranging from workerist to post-modernist. Most of them are still connected to the respective groups that identify as "Anarchist".

==Influence==
The Autonomist Marxist and ''Autonomen'' movements provided inspiration to some on the revolutionary left in English-speaking countries, particularly among anarchists, many of whom have adopted autonomist tactics. Some English-speaking anarchists{{who|date=January 2013}} even describe themselves as ''Autonomists''.{{citation needed|date=January 2013}} The Italian ''operaismo'' movement also influenced Marxist academics such as [[Harry Cleaver]], [[John Holloway (economist)|John Holloway]], Steve Wright, and Nick Dyer-Witheford.{{citation needed|date=January 2013}} In Denmark and Sweden, the word is used as a catch-all phrase for anarchists and the extra-parliamentary left in general, as was seen in the media coverage of the eviction of the [[Ungdomshuset]] [[squatting|squat]] in [[Copenhagen]] in March 2007.{{citation needed|date=January 2013}}

'''''Bhūmi''''' ([[Sanskrit]]: भूमि) is the 32 and 33 place (10 and 11 in simple count) on the outgoing's process of [[Mahayana]] [[Enlightenment in Buddhism|awakening]]. In [[Buddhism]], initially the [[monks]] who arrived at ''Bhūmi'' were called [[śrāvakas]] in opposition to [[Brahminism]]. [[Śakra (Buddhism)|Śakro devānām]] and [[Trāyastriṃśa]] are together called "Bhūmi nivāsin".

The Sanskrit term ''[[wikt:भूमि#Sanskrit|bhūmi]]'' literally means "ground" or "foundation". Each stage represents a level of attainment in that case, and serves as a basis for the next one. Each level marks a definite advancement in one's training, that is accompanied by progressively greater power and wisdom.

Another term used to describe the ten [[bodhisattva]] stages was "vihara" (abode, dwelling).&lt;ref&gt;Takeuchi Yoshinori (editor). Buddhist Spirituality: Indian, Southeast Asian, Tibetan, and Early Chinese, page 164&lt;/ref&gt; 

==Five Paths==
The bhūmis are subcategories of the Five Paths (''pañcamārga'', [[Wylie transliteration|Wylie Tibetan]] ''lam lnga''):&lt;ref name="5paths"&gt;[http://www.losangsamten.com/files/04_intro_buddhist_path_5_paths.pdf Losangsamten, ''Introduction to the Buddhist Path'']&lt;/ref&gt;
#'''The path of accumulation''' (''saṃbhāra-mārga'', Wylie Tibetan: ''tshogs lam''). Persons on this Path:
## Possess a strong desire to overcome suffering, either their own or others;
## Renounce the worldly life.&lt;ref name="5paths" /&gt;
#'''The path of preparation''' or '''application''' (''prayoga-mārga'', Wylie Tibetan: ''sbyor lam''). Persons on this Path:
## Start practicing meditation;
## Have analytical knowledge of [[Sunyata|emptiness]].&lt;ref name="5paths" /&gt;
#'''The path of seeing''' (''[[darśana]]-mārga'', Wylie Tibetan: ''mthong lam''). Persons on this Path:
## Practice profound [[Samatha|concentration meditation]] on the nature of reality;
## Realize the emptiness of reality.&lt;ref name="5paths" /&gt;
#'''The path of meditation''' (''[[bhāvanā]]-mārga'', Wylie Tibetan: ''sgom lam''). Persons on this path purify themselves and accumulate [[Wisdom in Buddhism|wisdom]].&lt;ref name="5paths" /&gt;
#'''The path of no more learning''' or '''consummation''' (''aśaikṣā-mārga'', Wylie Tibetan: ''mi slob pa’i lam'' or ''thar phyin pa'i lam''). Persons on this Path have completely purified themselves.&lt;ref name="5paths" /&gt;

Passage through the grounds and paths begins with [[Bodhicitta]], the wish to liberate all sentient beings. ''Aspiring Bodhicitta'' becomes ''Engaging Bodhicitta'' upon actual commitment to the [[Bodhisattva vows]]. With these steps, the practitioner becomes a [[Bodhisattva]], and enters upon the paths.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Gyatso|2003|loc=[https://books.google.com/books?id=pHrATkNDRtkC&amp;pg=PA536 pp. 535–536]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Before attaining the ten grounds, the bodhisattva traverses the first two of the five [[Mahayana]] paths:
#The path of accumulation
#The path of preparation

The ten grounds of the bodhisattva are grouped within the three subsequent paths:
#Bhūmi 1: The path of seeing
#Bhūmi 2-7: The path of meditation
#Bhūmi 8-10: The path of no more learning

In [[Huayan school|Hua-yen]] Buddhism there are some 40 previous stages before the first bhumi:
* [[10 faiths]]
* [[10 abodes]]
* [[10 practices]]
* [[10 merit-transferences]]

In [[Tientai]] Buddhism the practitioner of the so-called "perfect teaching" is equal in attainment to [[arhats]] by just the 4th faith.

Mahayana literature often features an enumeration of "two obstructions" (Wylie: ''sgrib gnyis''): 
# The "obstructions of delusive emotions" (Sanskrit: ''kleśa-varaṇa'', Wylie: ''nyon-mongs-pa'i sgrib-ma'')
# The "obstructions to knowledge" (Sanskrit: ''jñeyāvaraṇa'', Wylie: ''shes-bya'i sgrib-ma'').&lt;ref&gt;Dorje, Jikdrel Yeshe ([[Dudjom Rinpoche]], author), translated and edited: [[Gyurme Dorje]] and [[Matthew Kapstein]] (1991). ''The Nyingma School of Tibetan Buddhism: Its Fundamentals and History''. Boston, USA: Wisdom Publications. {{ISBN|0-86171-199-8}}, p.&amp;nbsp;107(Enumerations).&lt;/ref&gt; 
The obstruction of delusive emotions  is overcome at the attainment of the path of seeing, and the obstructions to knowledge are overcome over the course of the path of meditation. This is not a statement agreed upon by all Buddhist schools, e.g. [[Korean Son]]'s [[Kihwa]] states that the obstructions to knowledge are overcome by the 10th bhumi.

==Ten bhūmis==
The [[Avatamsaka Sutra|Avataṃsakasūtra]] refers to the following ten bhūmis.&lt;ref&gt;Sutra Translation Committee of the United States and Canada (1998). [https://web.archive.org/web/20130430021312/http://www.buddhanet.net/pdf_file/budglossary.pdf ''The Seeker's  Glossary of Buddhism''],  Taipei: The Corporate Body of the Buddha Educational Foundation/Buddha Dharma Education Association Inc., 2nd ed. pp.759-760&lt;/ref&gt; 

# '''''The first bhūmi, the Very Joyous.''''' (Skt. ''pramuditā''), in which one rejoices at realizing a partial aspect of the truth;
# '''''The second bhūmi, the Stainless.''''' (Skt. ''vimalā''), in which one is free from all defilement;
# '''''The third bhūmi, the Light-Maker.''''' (Skt. ''prabhākarī''), in which one radiates the light of wisdom;
# '''''The fourth bhūmi, the Radiant Intellect.''''' (Skt. ''arciṣmatī''), in which the radiant flame of wisdom burns away earthly desires;
# '''''The fifth bhūmi, the Difficult to Master.''''' (Skt. ''sudurjayā''), in which one surmounts the illusions of darkness, or ignorance as the [[Middle Way]];
# '''''The sixth bhūmi, the Manifest.''''' (Skt. ''abhimukhī'') in which supreme wisdom begins to manifest;
# '''''The seventh bhūmi, the Gone Afar.''''' (Skt. ''dūraṃgamā''), in which one rises above the states of the [[Two vehicles]];
# '''''The eighth bhūmi, the Immovable.''''' (Skt. ''acalā''), in which one dwells firmly in the truth of the [[Middle Way]] and cannot be [[perturbed]] by anything;
# '''''The ninth bhūmi, the Good Intelligence.''''' (Skt. ''sādhumatī''), in which one preaches the Law freely and without restriction;
# '''''The tenth bhūmi, the Cloud of Doctrine.''''' (Skt. ''dharmameghā''), in which one benefits all [[Sentient beings (Buddhism)|sentient beings]] with the Law ([[Dharma]]), just as a cloud sends down rain impartially on all things.

=== The first bhūmi, the Very Joyous ===
The First bhūmi, called "Very Joyous", is attained with the first direct perception of emptiness ([[Sunyata]]) and is simultaneous with entry into the third of the five paths to awakening, the path of seeing.&lt;ref&gt;This explanation is given by the Korean scholar Wonch'uk in his ''Commentary on the Sutra Explaining the Thought (Arya-gambhīra-saṃdhinirmocana-sūtra-ṭīkā; 'Phags pa dgongs pa zab mo nges par 'grel pa'i mdo'i rgya cher 'grel pa;'' Delhi: Delhi Karmapae Choedhey, Gyalwae Sungrab Partun Khang, 1985, ''mdo 'grel,'' vol. ''thi'' [119], p. 523.3)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;See also Nargajuna's ''Precious Garland'' (''Ratnāvalī''; tr. {{harvp|Hopkins|1974}}), verse 441.&lt;/ref&gt; It is called "very joyous" because the bodhisattva works at the perfections of generosity and develops the ability to give away everything without regret and with no thought of praise or reward (for themselves). All phenomena are viewed as empty and as subject to decay, suffering, and death, and so bodhisattvas lose all attachment to them. According to [[Tsong Khapa]], first level bodhisattvas directly understand that persons do not exist by way of their own nature. Due to this, they overcome the false idea that the five aggregates constitute a truly existent person. They also eliminate predispositions toward corrupted ethics so completely that they will not arise again.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Hopkins|1985|pp=140–142}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite having directly and correctly perceived (but not yet realized) emptiness, bodhisattvas on the first level are primarily motivated by [[fait in Buddhism|faith]]. While they can return to the authentic perception of emptiness within the context of formal practice or receiving instruction, during post-meditation their awareness of emptiness is largely analytical or faith-based. They train in ethics in order to cleanse their minds of negativity and, so they prepare themselves for the cultivation of mundane meditative absorption that comes on the second level.

=== The second bhūmi, the Stainless ===
Bodhisattvas on the second level, the "Stainless", perfect ethics and overcome all tendencies towards engagement in negative actions. Their control becomes so complete that even in dreams they have no immoral thoughts. According to Tsong Khapa for such a bodhisattva, &lt;blockquote&gt;
"on all occasions of waking and dreaming his movements or activities of body, speech and mind are pure of even subtle infractions...he fulfills the three paths of virtuous actions-abandoning killing, stealing, and sexual misconduct-with his body; the middle four-abandons lying, divisive talk, harsh speech, and senseless chatter-with his speech; and the last three-abandoning covetousness, harmful intent, and wrong views-with his mind. Not only does he refrain from what is prohibited but he also fulfills all the positive achievements related to proper ethics."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Hopkins|1985|pp=193–194}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

And according to Nāgārjuna,
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;poem&gt;
The second is called the Stainless
Because all ten [virtuous] actions
Of body, speech, and mind are stainless
And they naturally abide in those [deeds of ethics].
Through the maturation of those [good qualities]
The perfection of ethics becomes supreme.
They become Universal Monarchs helping beings,
Masters of the glorious four continents and of the seven precious objects.&lt;/poem&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Because of this, the bodhisattva's mind becomes purified and equinanimous, which is a prerequisite for training in the four [[Dhyāna in Buddhism|dhyāna]]s (meditative absorptions) and the four [[arūpajhāna]]s (formless absorptions).

=== The third bhūmi, the Light-Maker ===
Tsong Khapa states that the third bhūmi is called the "Light-Maker" because when it is attained "the fire of wisdom burning all the fuel of objects of knowledge arises along with a light which by nature is able to extinguish all elaborations of duality during meditative equipoise."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Hopkins|1985|p=204}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bodhisattvas on this level cultivate the perfection of patience. Their equanimity becomes so profound that

&lt;blockquote&gt;even if someone...cuts from the body of this bodhisattva not just flesh but also bone, not in large sections but bit by bit, not continually but pausing in between, and not finishing in a short time but cutting over a long period, the bodhisattva would not get angry at the mutilator.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Hopkins|1985|p=206}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The Bodhisattva realizes that his tormentor is motivated by afflicted thoughts and is sowing seeds of his own future suffering. As a result, the bodhisattva feels not anger, but a deep sadness and compassion for this cruel person, who is unaware of the operations of karma. Trainees on the third level overcome all tendencies toward anger, and never react with hatred (or even annoyance) to any harmful acts or words. Rather, their equanimity remains constant, and all sentient beings are viewed with love and compassion:

All anger and resentment rebound on the person who generates them, and they do nothing to eliminate harms that one has already experienced. They are counterproductive in that they destroy one's peace of mind and lead to unfavorable future situations. There is nothing to be gained through anger and resentment, revenge does nothing to change the past, and so the bodhisattva avoids them.

Bodhisattvas on this level also train in the four [[Rupajhana|form meditations]], the four [[arūpajhāna|formless meditations]], and the [[Brahma-vihara|four immeasurables]], and the [[Abhijna|higher knowledges]].

=== The fourth bhūmi, the Radiant Intellect ===
On the fourth level, the "Radiant Intellect", bodhisattvas cultivate the perfection of effort and eliminate afflictions. According to Wonch'uk, this level is so named because fourth bhumi bodhisattvas "constantly emit the radiance of exalted wisdom." He also cites [[Maitreya-nātha|Maitreya's]] ''[[Mahayana-sutra-alamkara-karika|Ornament for the Mahayana Sutras]]'', which explains that bodhisattvas on this level burn up the afflictive obstructions and the obstructions to omniscience with the radiance of their wisdom.&lt;ref&gt;Wongch'uk, vol. ''thi'' [119], p. 527.5.&lt;/ref&gt; They enter into progressively deeper meditative absorptions and attain a powerful mental pliancy as a result. This eliminates laziness and increases their ability to practice meditation for extended periods of time. They destroy deeply rooted afflictions and cultivate the [[Bodhipakkhiyādhammā|thirty-seven factors of awakening]].

Through training in these thirty-seven practices, bodhisattvas develop great skill in meditative absorptions and cultivate wisdom, while weakening the artificial and innate conceptions of true existence.

=== The fifth bhūmi, Difficult to Master ===
The fifth level is called the "Difficult to Master" because it involves practices that are so arduous and require a great deal of effort to perfect. It is also called the "Difficult to Overcome" because when one has completed the training of this level one has profound wisdom and insight that are difficult to surpass or undermine. According to Nāgārjuna,&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;poem&gt;
The fifth is called the Extremely Difficult to Overcome
Since all evil ones find it extremely hard to conquer him;
He becomes skilled in knowing the subtle
Meanings of the noble truths and so forth.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Hopkins|1974|p=85}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/poem&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Bodhisattvas on this level cultivate the perfection of [[Samādhi (Buddhism)|samadhi]]. They develop strong powers of meditative stabilization and overcome tendencies toward distraction. They achieve mental one-pointedness and they perfect calm abiding. They also fully penetrate the meanings of the [[four noble truths]] and the two truths (conventional truths and ultimate truths) and perceive all phenomena as empty, transient and prone to suffering.

=== The sixth bhūmi, the Manifest ===
The sixth level is called the "Manifest" because the bodhisattva clearly perceives the workings of [[dependent arising]] and directly understands "the signless" (''Mtshan ma med pa'', Tibetan. ''Animitta'', Sanskrit). The signless refers to the fact that phenomena seem to possess their apparent qualities by way of their own nature, but when one examines this appearance one realizes that all qualities are merely mentally imputed and not a part of the nature of the objects they appear to characterize.

As a result of these understandings bodhisattvas manifest [[meditation|meditative]] [[Wisdom in Buddhism|wisdom]] and avoid attachment to either [[Rebirth (Buddhism)|cyclic existence]] or [[nirvana]].&lt;ref&gt;This explanation is given by Wonch'uk (vol. ''thi'' [119], p. 531.1, whose source is the ''Sutra on the Ten Bhumis''&lt;/ref&gt; Having overcome all attachments, [[bodhisattva]]s on this level can attain [[nirvana]], but because of the force of the mind of awakening they decide to remain in the world in order to benefit other [[Sentient beings (Buddhism)|sentient beings]]. They cultivate the [[Perfection of Wisdom]], through which they perceive all phenomena as lacking inherent existence, as being like dreams, illusions, reflections, or magically created objects. All notions of "I" and "other" are transcended, along with conceptions of "inherent existence" and "inherent nonexistence." These sixth-level bodhisattvas abide in contemplation of suchness, with minds that are undisturbed by false ideas.

=== The seventh bhūmi, the Gone Afar ===
Bodhisattvas on the seventh level develop the ability to contemplate signlessness uninterruptedly and enter into advanced [[jhana|meditative absorptions]] for extended periods of time, thus passing beyond both the [[mundane]] and [[supramundane]] paths of [[śrāvaka]]s and [[Pratyekabuddha]]s (Hearers and solitary realizers). For this reason, this level is called the "Gone Afar."&lt;ref&gt;This explanation is given by Wonch'uk (vol. ''thi'' [119], p. 532.6), on a basis of a commentary on the ''Sutra on the Ten Bhumis'', but he does not provide that exact title.&lt;/ref&gt; According to Nāgārjuna, &lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;poem&gt;
The seventh is the Gone Afar because
The number of his qualities has increased,
Moment by moment he can enter
The equipoise of [[nirvana|cessation]],&lt;ref name="Hopkins_1974_86"&gt;{{harv|Hopkins|1974|p=86}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/poem&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
On this level bodhisattvas perfect their [[Upaya|skill in means of meditation and practice]] (''Thabs la mkhas pa'', Tibetan; ''Upaya-Kausalya'', Sanskrit), which is their ability to cleverly adapt their teaching tactics to the individual proclivities and needs of their audiences. They also develop the ability to know the thoughts of others, and in every moment are able to practice all the [[paramita|perfections]]. All thoughts and actions are free from afflictions, and they constantly act spontaneously and effectively for the benefit of others.

=== The eighth bhūmi, the Immovable ===
The eighth level is called the "Immovable" because [[bodhisattva]]s overcome all afflictions regarding signs and their minds are always completely absorbed in the [[dharma]].  At this level, a bodhisattva has achieved [[Nirvana#mahayana perspectives|nirvana]]. According to [[Nāgārjuna]],&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;poem&gt;
The eighth is the Immovable, the youthful stage,
Through nonconceptuality he is immovable;
And the spheres of his body, speech and mind's
Activities are inconceivable.&lt;ref name="Hopkins_1974_86"/&gt;&lt;/poem&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Because they are fully acquainted with signlessness, their minds are not moved by ideas of signs. Eighth Bhumi bodhisattvas are said to be "irreversible", because there is no longer any possibility that they might waver on the path or backslide. They are destined for full buddhahood, and there are no longer any inclinations to seek a personal nirvana. They cultivate the "perfection of aspiration", which means that they undertake to fulfill various vows, due to which they accumulate the causes of further virtues.&lt;ref&gt;This explanation is found in the ''Compendium of Mahayana'', p. 208.&lt;/ref&gt; Although they resolve to work for the benefit of others and they pervade the universe with feelings of [[metta|friendliness]] toward all sentient beings, these bodhisattvas have transcended any tendency to misunderstand [[anatta]].

Their understanding of [[sunyata|emptiness]] is so complete that it overturns innate delusions, and reality appears in a completely new light. They enter into [[sunyata|meditation on emptiness]] with little effort. Bodhisattvas on this level are compared to people who have awakened from dreams, and all their perceptions are influenced by this new awareness. They attain the meditative state called "forbearance regarding [[Anutpada|non-arisen phenomena]]", due to which they no longer think in terms of inherent causes or inherent causelessness. They also develop the ability to manifest in various forms in order to instruct others. Compassion and skillful means are automatic and spontaneous. There is no need to plan or contemplate how best to benefit others, since bodhisattvas on the eighth level automatically react correctly to every situation.

=== The ninth bhūmi, the Good Intelligence ===
From this point on, bodhisattvas move quickly toward [[bodhi|awakening]]. Before this stage, progress was comparatively slow, like that of a boat being towed through a harbour. On the eighth through tenth bhumi, however, [[bodhisattva]]s make huge strides toward buddhahood, like a ship that reaches the ocean and unfurls its sails. On the ninth level, they fully understand the three vehicles - [[Śrāvaka|hearers]], [[Pratyekabuddha|solitary realizers]], and [[bodhisattva]]s - and perfect the ability to teach the doctrine. According to the ''Sutra Explaining the Thought'',&lt;blockquote&gt;
Because of attaining faultlessness and very extensive intelligence in terms of mastery of teaching the doctrine in all aspects, the ninth level is called the "Good Intelligence."&lt;ref&gt;''Sutra Explaining the Thought'', p. 116.3.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Ninth bhūmi bodhisattvas also acquire the "four analytical knowledges"-of fundamental concepts, meaning, grammar, and exposition. Due to this, they develop wondrous eloquence and skill in presenting doctrinal teachings. Their intelligence surpasses that of all humans and gods, and they comprehend all names, words, meanings, and languages. They can understand any question from any being. They also have the ability to answer them with a single sound, which is understood by each being according to its capacities. On this level they also cultivate the perfection of [[virya]], which means that because of the strength of their mastery of the four analytical knowledges and their meditation they are able to develop [[paramita]]s energetically and to practice them continually without becoming fatigued.&lt;ref&gt;See {{harvp|Lamotte|1973|p=208}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== The tenth bhūmi, the Cloud of Dharma ===
On the tenth bhūmi, [[bodhisattva]]s overcome the subtlest traces of the afflictions. Like a cloud that pours rain on the earth, these bodhisattvas spread the dharma in all directions, and each [[Sentient beings (Buddhism)|sentient being]] absorbs what it needs in order to grow spiritually. Thus Nāgārjuna states that
&lt;blockquote&gt;
The tenth is the Cloud of Dharma because&lt;br/&gt;
The rain of excellent doctrine falls,&lt;br/&gt;
The Bodhisattva is consecrated&lt;br/&gt;
With light by the Buddhas.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Hopkins|1974|p=87}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

At this stage bodhisattvas enter into progressively deeper meditative absorptions and develop limitless powers with regard to magical formulas. They cultivate the perfection of exalted wisdom, which, according to [[Asaṅga]], enables them to increase their exalted wisdom. This in turn strengthens the other perfections. As a result, they become established in the joy of the doctrine.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Lamotte|1973|pp=208–299}}&lt;/ref&gt;

They acquire perfect bodies, and their minds are cleansed of the subtlest traces of the afflictions. They manifest in limitless forms for the benefit of others and transcend the ordinary laws of time and space. They are able to place entire world systems in a single pore, without diminishing them or increasing the size of the pore. When they do this, the beings inhabiting the worlds feel no discomfort, and only those who are advanced [[bodhisattva]]s even notice.

Bodhisattvas on this level receive a form of empowerment from innumerable buddhas. This is called "great rays of light", because the radiance of these bodhisattvas shines in all directions. This empowerment helps them in removing the remaining obstructions to omniscience and gives them added confidence and strength. At the final moment of this stage they enter into a meditative state called the "vajralike meditative stabilization", in which the subtlest remaining obstacles to buddhahood are overcome. They arise from this concentration as [[Buddhahood|Buddhas]].

==Additional bhūmi==
Within the 10th bhūmi, various [[Vajrayana]] schools recognize 3–13 additional bhūmi.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fjdh.cn/wumin/2013/04/165725224642.html 九乘次第论集 附录 四部宗义要略] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150415052512/http://www.fjdh.cn/wumin/2013/04/165725224642.html |date=April 15, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Classical mechanics}}
In [[mathematics]] and [[classical mechanics]], '''canonical coordinates''' are sets of [[coordinates]] on [[phase space]] which can be used to describe a physical system at any given point in time. Canonical coordinates are used in the [[Hamiltonian mechanics|Hamiltonian formulation]] of [[classical mechanics]]. A closely related concept also appears in [[quantum mechanics]]; see the [[Stone–von Neumann theorem]] and [[canonical commutation relation]]s for details.

As Hamiltonian mechanics is generalized by [[symplectic geometry]] and [[canonical transformation]]s are generalized by [[contact transformation]]s, so the 19th century definition of canonical coordinates in classical mechanics may be generalized to a more abstract 20th century definition of coordinates on the [[cotangent bundle]] of a [[manifold]] (the mathematical notion of phase space).

==Definition in classical mechanics==
In [[classical mechanics]], '''canonical coordinates''' are coordinates &lt;math&gt;q_i&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;p_i&lt;/math&gt; in [[phase space]] that are used in the [[Hamiltonian mechanics|Hamiltonian]] formalism. The canonical coordinates satisfy the fundamental [[Poisson bracket]] relations:

:&lt;math&gt;\{q_i, q_j\} = 0 \qquad \{p_i, p_j\} = 0 \qquad \{q_i, p_j\} = \delta_{ij}&lt;/math&gt;

A typical example of canonical coordinates is for &lt;math&gt;q_i&lt;/math&gt; to be the usual [[Cartesian coordinates]], and &lt;math&gt;p_i&lt;/math&gt; to be the components of [[momentum]]. Hence in general, the &lt;math&gt;p_i&lt;/math&gt; coordinates are referred to as "conjugate momenta."

Canonical coordinates can be obtained from the [[generalized coordinates]] of the [[Lagrangian mechanics|Lagrangian]] formalism by a [[Legendre transformation]], or from another set of canonical coordinates by a [[canonical transformation]].

==Definition on cotangent bundles==
Canonical coordinates are defined as a special set of [[coordinates]] on the [[cotangent bundle]] of a [[manifold]]. They are usually written as a set of &lt;math&gt;(q^i,p_j)&lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt;(x^i,p_j)&lt;/math&gt; with the ''x'' 's or ''q'' 's denoting the coordinates on the underlying manifold and the ''p'' 's denoting the '''conjugate momentum''', which are [[1-form]]s in the cotangent bundle at point ''q'' in the manifold.

A common definition of canonical coordinates is any set of coordinates on the cotangent bundle that allow the [[canonical one-form]] to be written in the form
:&lt;math&gt;\sum_i p_i\,\mathrm{d}q^i&lt;/math&gt;

up to a total differential. A change of coordinates that preserves this form is a [[canonical transformation]]; these are a special case of a [[symplectomorphism]], which are essentially a change of coordinates on a [[symplectic manifold]].

In the following exposition, we assume that the manifolds are real manifolds, so that cotangent vectors acting on tangent vectors produce real numbers.

==Formal development==
Given a manifold {{mvar|Q}}, a [[vector field]] {{mvar|X}} on {{mvar|Q}} (a [[section (fiber bundle)|section]] of the [[tangent bundle]] {{math|''TQ''}}) can be thought of as a function acting on the [[cotangent bundle]], by the duality between the tangent and cotangent spaces.  That is, define a function

:&lt;math&gt;P_X:T^*Q\to \mathbb{R}&lt;/math&gt;

such that

:&lt;math&gt;P_X(q,p)=p(X_q)&lt;/math&gt;

holds for all cotangent vectors {{mvar|p}} in &lt;math&gt;T_q^*Q&lt;/math&gt;. Here, &lt;math&gt;X_q&lt;/math&gt; is a vector in &lt;math&gt;T_qQ&lt;/math&gt;, the tangent space to the manifold {{mvar|Q}} at point {{mvar|q}}.  The function &lt;math&gt;P_X&lt;/math&gt; is called the ''momentum function'' corresponding to {{mvar|X}}.

In [[atlas (topology)|local coordinates]], the vector field {{mvar|X}} at point {{mvar|q}} may be written as

:&lt;math&gt;X_q=\sum_i X^i(q) \frac{\partial}{\partial q^i}&lt;/math&gt;

where the &lt;math&gt;\partial /\partial q^i&lt;/math&gt; are the coordinate frame on {{mvar|TQ}}. The conjugate momentum then has the expression 

:&lt;math&gt;P_X(q,p)=\sum_i X^i(q) \;p_i&lt;/math&gt; 

where the &lt;math&gt;p_i&lt;/math&gt; are defined as the momentum functions corresponding to the vectors &lt;math&gt;\partial /\partial q^i&lt;/math&gt;:

:&lt;math&gt;p_i = P_{\partial /\partial q^i}&lt;/math&gt;

The &lt;math&gt;q^i&lt;/math&gt; together with the &lt;math&gt;p_j&lt;/math&gt; together form a coordinate system on the cotangent bundle &lt;math&gt;T^*Q&lt;/math&gt;; these coordinates are called the ''canonical coordinates''.

==Generalized coordinates==
In [[Lagrangian mechanics]], a different set of coordinates are used, called the [[generalized coordinates]].  These are commonly denoted as &lt;math&gt;(q_i,\dot{q}_i)&lt;/math&gt; with &lt;math&gt;q_i&lt;/math&gt; called the '''generalized position''' and &lt;math&gt;\dot{q}_i&lt;/math&gt; the '''generalized velocity'''.  When a [[symplectic vector field|Hamiltonian]] is defined  on the cotangent bundle, then the generalized coordinates are related to the canonical coordinates by means of the [[Hamilton–Jacobi equation]]s.

'''Chronocentrism''' is the assumption that certain time periods (typically the [[present]]) are better, more important, or a more significant frame of reference than other time periods, either past or future.

==History==
Chronocentrism (from the Greek ''[[wikt:chrono-|chrono-]]'' meaning "time") was coined by sociologist Jib Fowles in an article in the journal ''Futures'' in February, 1974. Fowles described chronocentrism as "the belief that one's own times are paramount, that other periods pale in comparison".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Fowles |first1=Jib |title=On Chronocentrism |work=Futures |volume=6 |number=1 |doi=10.1016/0016-3287(74)90008-1 |date=February 1974 |page=249}}&lt;/ref&gt; More recently, it has been defined as "the egotism that one's own generation is poised on the very cusp of history".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Standage |first=Tom |authorlink=Tom Standage |title=[[The Victorian Internet|The Victorian Internet: The Remarkable Story of the Telegraph and the Nineteenth Century's On-line Pioneers]] |year=2007 |publisher=Walker &amp; Company |isbn=0-8027-1604-0 |pages=256}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The term had been used earlier in a study about attitudes to ageing in the workplace. Chronocentricity: "...only seeing the value of one's own age cohort...described the tendency for younger managers to hold negative perceptions of the abilities or other work-related competencies of older employees."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Lyon |first1=Phil |last2=Pollard |first2=D|title=Perceptions of the older employee: is anything really changing?|journal=Personnel Review|volume=26 |number=4 |doi=10.1108/00483489710172051|date=1 January 1997 |page=249}}&lt;/ref&gt; This type of discrimination is a form of [[ageism]].

==Ethnocentrism==

Chronocentrism as [[ethnocentrism]] is the perceiving and judging of a culture's historical values in terms of the standards of one's own time period.

==Antichronocentrism==

The [[Long Now Foundation]] is an organization that encourages the use of 5-digit years, e.g. "02016" instead of "2016," to help emphasize how early the present time is in their vision of the timeline of humanity.  The use of two-digit years before [[Y2K]] was an example of chronocentrism (in the early years of computing, the years 2000 and 1899 were believed to be too far in the future or the past, and thus of less importance than being able to save two digits in computerizing and typing out years).

==In science==
The "Copernican time principle" is a temporal analog of the [[Copernican principle]] for space, which states that no spatial location is any more or less special of a frame of reference than any other spatial location (i.e., that our physical universe has no center). Some authors have extended this to also include that no point in time is any more or less special than any other point in time (e.g., in outdated [[steady-state theories]]), though this cannot be universally applied (e.g., the [[Big-Bang singularity]] is a special point in time that can be logically used as a frame of reference to date later events.)

'''Chua Beng Huat''' ({{zh|t=蔡明發|s=蔡明发|poj=Chhòa Bêng-hoat}}) is a [[Singapore]]an sociologist. He is a Provost Professor at the Department of [[Sociology]] at [[National University of Singapore]] (NUS), and concurrently the Cluster Leader of the Cultural Studies in Asia program at the [[Asia Research Institute]] (ARI). Until mid-2015, Chua headed the Department of Sociology at [[National University of Singapore]].

Chua did not have an early start in [[social sciences]] or [[humanities]]. Instead, he studied [[Biology]] and [[Chemistry]] in his undergraduate years. In the 1960s where college campuses in [[North America]] were fertile ground for counterculture, his involvement with student political activities made him realize that he did not have the right personality for natural science.&lt;ref name="profile"&gt;http://profile.nus.edu.sg/fass/soccbh/index.htm&lt;/ref&gt; He headed to [[York University]], [[Toronto]], to take up [[Environmental Studies]] in 1970. A year later, he switched to [[Sociology]] and received a M.A and a PhD.&lt;ref&gt;‘In Conversation with Prof. Chua Beng-Huat’, ''International Sociological Association E-Bulletin'', No. 7, July 2007, p. 39.&lt;/ref&gt;

On whether his lack of an undergraduate degree in [[Sociology]] posed an obstacle in his graduate years, Chua remarked, “Probably it was a blessing in disguise. I think if I had done undergraduate degrees in [[Sociology]], I would have sort of glossed over lots of important theoretical readings, feeling that I already know them. Because I didn’t, I read most of the classic texts during my first year in the M.A program. That probably was foundationally the most important thing that happened. I find that with that kind of grounding substantive fields are fairly easy to take up and put down. After twenty five years, I still think that is true.” &lt;ref&gt;‘In Conversation with Prof. Chua Beng-Huat’, p. 40.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Early works ==
Chua’s emphasis on the theoretical over the substantive is evident in his PhD dissertation. Written at a time when an understanding of how reality is socially constructed was just beginning to emerge, he used the Preliminary Report of the Canadian Royal Commission on Bilingualism and Biculturalism to analyze how government reports are written such that they are demonstrably democratic. It was a [[Phenomenology (philosophy)|phenomenological]], [[ethnomethodological]] and [[interpretive]] piece that exposed mechanisms by which [[democracy]] is made visible in texts.

“I could have written on reports on crime or whatever because the substance was not important. The really important issue is the production of [[democracy]] textually in government reports because government reports, in whatever field, [[urban planning]] or [[deviance (sociology)|deviance]] or [[policing]], must not be seen as biased in any particular way. It was the processes, procedures and practices – how to manage information that was coming into the report – that was important to me. Specifically, I was not interested in anything substantive. I was only interested in the practices of how one actually uses the structure of the text so that it would appear to be unquestionably democratic.” Commenting on his dissertation: “One of the interesting things I think most people don’t realize is that those kinds of ethnomethodological work can actually be used for social change. Knowing how reality is put together is to know, at the same time, how it can be deconstructed. If you know how reality is constructed, then you know how it can be changed.” &lt;ref&gt;‘In Conversation with Prof. Chua Beng-Huat’, p. 41.&lt;/ref&gt;

Shortly after his graduate studies, Chua taught at [[Trent University]], [[Ontario]] for about seven or eight years. In 1984, the [[Housing and Development Board]] (HDB) offered him the Director of Research post. He returned to Singapore and took up the position.&lt;ref name="profile" /&gt; He began to stray away from wholly theoretical work and focused on writing critically about [[Singapore]] as well, including writing a weekly column in the national newspaper, [[The Straits Times]], for one year. As he explained, “Once I came back to Singapore, to a certain extent, what happens locally politically gets personalized. I feel not just the responsibility but also the right to be critically analytical of a society to which my own life is embedded. In that sense, I kind of changed from being an academic to a more public intellectual; in [[Canada]], I was basically an academic whose concerns are of conceptual and theoretical questions of how to do sociology.” &lt;ref&gt;‘In Conversation with Prof. Chua Beng-Huat’, p. 42.&lt;/ref&gt;

His knack for scrutinizing the workings of Singapore society and his insistence on doing so publicly did not go unnoticed. Within a year, he was fired from his job at [[HDB]] for his critical writings of Singapore politics. He joined [[National University of Singapore|NUS]] afterward, and has been there since 1985.&lt;ref name="profile" /&gt; The turn of events did not make Chua ease up on his public assessments of social reality in Singapore and beyond. In fact, it freed him of the constraint of being a civil servant and his research and writings expanded into more areas.

==Current research interests ==
His research efforts are focused on three key areas: [[comparative politics]] in [[Southeast Asia]], urban and housing planning, and [[Cultural Studies]] in [[Asia]].&lt;ref&gt;‘In Conversation with Prof. Chua Beng-Huat’, ''International Sociological Association E-Bulletin'', No. 7, July 2007, pp. 54-55.&lt;/ref&gt;

One noteworthy work in the area of [[comparative politics]] in Southeast Asia is his discussion of communitarian politics. He asserts that [[liberalism]] and [[democracy]] do not necessarily have to go hand in hand in Asia. With nationhood being a new phenomenon and liberalism lacking deep historical roots in much of Asia, he questioned what other values instead of those of liberalism might be promoted in these regions, and analyzed dynamics that surround construing national ideologies in [[communitarian]] terms. In this way, he revealed how social practices in parts of Asia disrupt the global hegemony of liberalism. In ''Communitarian Ideology and Democracy in Singapore'' for instance, a book that radically reoriented the analysis of politics in Singapore, he demonstrated that the undisrupted reign of [[People’s Action Party]] (PAP) was based on its ability to develop and maintain a Gramscian sense of [[ideological]] [[hegemony]], since the mid-1970s, rather than on [[authoritarianism]]. This ideological hegemony had enabled the Party to shift towards the concept of ‘Asian democracy’, an attempt to supplant liberalism with ‘Asian’ [[communitarism]].&lt;ref&gt;''Communitarian Ideology and Democracy in Singapore'' (London and New York: Routledge, 1995)&lt;/ref&gt;

In the area of urban and housing planning, Chua has made inquiries into the uniqueness of [[public housing in Singapore]], with it being neither an investment and consumer good in a free market, nor a social right as in [[socialist]] nations. In ''Political legitimacy and Housing: Stakeholding in Singapore'' for example, he shows that the success of its unique [[public housing]] system, which guarantees a home for all citizens, is a fundamental contribution to the [[ideological]] [[hegemony]] and thus legitimacy of the [[one-party state]] in Singapore.&lt;ref&gt;''Political Legitimacy and Housing: Stakeholding in Singapore'' (London and New York: Routledge, 1997)&lt;/ref&gt;

By the mid-1990s, as the capitalist economies in [[East Asia]] developed, Chua turned his attention to popular consumer culture. This resulted firstly in editing, ''Consumption in Asia: lifestyles and identities'', a volume in the Routledge New Rich in Asia Series.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.routledge.com/books/details/9780415232449/&lt;/ref&gt; This was followed by the attention-grabbing neon pink book ''Life is Not Complete without Shopping''. Playfully drawing its title from a 1996 National Day Rally speech by the then [[Prime Minister]] of [[Singapore]] [[Goh Chok Tong]], this book explored how Singapore’s social reality is constituted in an environment steeped in global consumer imagery. In it, he wrote about bodies, food, clothes and movies, diverse activities like hanging out at the town centre [[McDonald’s]], riding the escalator at [[Ngee Ann City]], a major shopping complex, and looking at price tags at [[Prada]] came together as analytical objects.&lt;ref&gt;''Life is Not Complete without Shopping'' (Singapore: Singapore University Press, 2003)&lt;/ref&gt;

By the late 1990s, Chua became increasingly interested in [[Cultural Studies]]. He became a founding Co-Executive Editor of the journal [[Inter-Asia Cultural Studies]]. With financial support from the [[Asia Research Institute]] at [[National University of Singapore]], where he leads the Cultural Studies in Asia Research Cluster, he organized conferences and workshops in related topics and themes. Edited volumes, such as ''Political Elections as Popular Culture'' and ''East Asian Pop Culture: analyzing the Korean Wave'', are results of these workshops. With these organizing and publication efforts, he has helped to develop a research community of scholars who are engaged in analyzing Asian pop music, film and television dramas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ari.nus.edu.sg/article_view.asp?id=24 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-07-30 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100729194702/http://www.ari.nus.edu.sg/article_view.asp?id=24 |archivedate=2010-07-29 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Other interests ==
Chua is an avid supporter of the arts. He was the [[Artistic Director]] of a multi-disciplinary group show SENI in 2004, and served on the Board of Directors for FOCAS, a now-defunct not-for-profit publishing initiative that primarily concerned itself with contemporary art, politics and social change in [[Singapore]] and [[Southeast Asia]]. Presently, he is on the International Advisory Board for the [[Asian Film Archive (AFA)]] and [[Chairman]] of the Board of Trustees of Temenggong Artists-In-Residence, a centre for artistic exchange and residence in [[Singapore]].

In [[psychology]]-related [[slang]], the term '''control freak''' describes an individual who attempts to undermine other people based on how one dictates how everything is done around them. The phrase was first used in the 1970s,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dictionary.com/browse/control-freak?s=t|title=the definition of control freak|author=|date=|website=Dictionary.com|accessdate=3 May 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171107020713/http://www.dictionary.com/browse/control-freak?s=t|archivedate=7 November 2017|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; an era when stress was laid on the principle of 'doing one's own thing' and letting others do the same.&lt;ref&gt;Kristin Glaser, in ''The Radical Therapist'' (Penguin 1974) p. 246&lt;/ref&gt;

== Personality psychology ==
{{See also|Abusive power and control}}
In the study of [[personality psychology]], certain [[personality disorders]] display characteristics involving the need to gain [[Compliance (psychology)|compliance]] or control over others:&lt;ref&gt;Larsen, Randy J., and [[David M. Buss]]. Personality Psychology: Domains of Knowledge about Human Nature. New York: McGraw-Hill Higher Education, 2010. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; 
* Those with [[antisocial personality disorder]] tend to display a glibness and [[grandiose]] sense of [[self-worth]]. Due to their [[shallow affect]] and lack of [[remorse]] or [[empathy]], they are well suited to con and/or [[Psychological manipulation|manipulate]] others into complying with their wishes. 
* Those with [[histrionic personality disorder]] need to be the [[attention seeking|center of attention]], and in turn, draw people in so they may use (and eventually dispose of) their relationship.  
* Those with [[narcissistic personality disorder]] have an inflated self-importance, hypersensitivity to [[criticism]] and a sense of [[entitlement]] that compels them to [[persuade]] others to comply with their requests.  To maintain their [[self-esteem]], and protect their [[true self|vulnerable selves]], [[narcissists]] need to control others' behavior – particularly that of [[Narcissistic parent|their children]] seen as extensions of themselves.&lt;ref name=co&gt;Rappoport, Alan, Ph. D.[http://www.alanrappoport.com/pdf/Co-Narcissism%20Article.pdf Co-Narcissism: How We Adapt to Narcissism. The Therapist, 2005] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150811150356/http://alanrappoport.com/pdf/Co-Narcissism%20Article.pdf |date=2015-08-11 }}.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Vulnerability===
{{See also|True self and false self}}
Control freaks are often [[Perfectionism (psychology)|perfectionists]]&lt;ref&gt;Michelle N. Lafrance, ''Women and Depression'' (2009) p. 89&lt;/ref&gt; defending themselves against their own inner [[vulnerabilities]] in the belief that if they are not in total control they risk exposing themselves once more to childhood [[angst]].&lt;ref&gt;Art Horn, ''Face It'' (2004) p. 53&lt;/ref&gt; Such persons [[Psychological manipulation|manipulate]] and [[Coercion|pressure]] others to change so as to avoid having to change themselves,&lt;ref&gt;Robin Skynner/John Cleese, ''Families and how to survive them'' (London 1994) p. 208&lt;/ref&gt; and use power over others to escape an inner emptiness.&lt;ref&gt;Robert Bly and Marion Woodman, ''The Maiden King'' (Dorset 1999) p. 141&lt;/ref&gt; When a control freak's pattern is broken, the controller is left with a terrible feeling of powerlessness but feeling their pain and fear brings them back to themselves.&lt;ref&gt;Patricia Evans, ''Controlling People'' (Avon 2002) p. 129 and p. 274&lt;/ref&gt;

Control freaks appear to have some similarities to [[codependents]], in the sense that the latters' fear of abandonment leads to attempts to control those they are dependent on.&lt;ref&gt;David Stafford &amp; [[Liz Hodgkinson]], ''Codependency'' (London 1995) p. 131&lt;/ref&gt; Recovery for them entails recognizing that being a control freak helped paradoxically preserve codependency itself.&lt;ref&gt;Deb M., in ''Stepping Stones to Recovery from Codependency'' (1993) p. 61&lt;/ref&gt;

In terms of personality-type theory, control freaks are very much the [[Type A and Type B personality theory|Type A]] personality, driven by the need to dominate and control.&lt;ref&gt;Andrew Holmes/Dan Wilson, ''Pains in the Office'' (2004) p. 56&lt;/ref&gt; An obsessive need to control others is also associated with [[antisocial personality disorder]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Martha Stout]], ''The Sociopath Next Door'' (2005) p. 47&lt;/ref&gt;

==In management==
In the corporate world, control freaks tend to publicly admonish their inferiors, especially during meetings.&lt;ref&gt;Andrew Buck&amp;nbsp;— [http://www.pmhut.com/meeting-behaviors-the-good-the-bad-and-the-ugly Meeting Behaviors: The Good, The Bad and The Ugly] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100610065229/http://www.pmhut.com/meeting-behaviors-the-good-the-bad-and-the-ugly |date=2010-06-10 }}&lt;/ref&gt; More positively, the term can also refer to someone with a limited number of things that they want done a specific way; professor of clinical psychology [[Les Parrott]] wrote that “Control Freaks are people who care more than you do about something and won't stop at being pushy to get their way”.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Parrot | first = Les | title = The Control Freak | publisher = Tyndale House Publishers | location = Carol Stream | year = 2001 | isbn = 0-8423-3793-8 }}&lt;/ref&gt; There may be a fine line between being a detail-oriented manager, who likes to have things done 'right', and being a (destructive) control freak.&lt;ref&gt;[[Gillian Tett]], ''Fool's Gold'' (London 2009) p. 165&lt;/ref&gt; Control freaks are usually a cause of [[micromanagement]].

In some cases, the control freak sees their constant intervention as beneficial or even necessary. This can be caused by feelings of separation or departure from a loved one; or by the belief that others are incapable of handling matters properly, or the fear that things will go wrong if they do not attend to every detail. In other cases, they may simply enjoy the feeling of power it gives them so much that they automatically try to gain control of everything and everyone around them.

==In history==

===Wellington v. Napoleon===
[[Arthur Wellesley, 1st Duke of Wellington|Wellington]] as military commander was undoubtedly a hands-on micromanager, trusting his subordinates as little as possible, and showing many of the characteristics of the modern day control freak.&lt;ref&gt;Richard Holmes, ''Wellington: The Iron Duke'' (London 2003) p. 178 and p. 169&lt;/ref&gt; In 1811 he wrote that “I am obliged to be everywhere and if absent from any operation, something goes wrong&amp;nbsp;… success can only be attained by attention to the most minute details”.&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in Michael Glover, ''Wellington as Military Commander'' (London 1968) p. 205&lt;/ref&gt;

By contrast, [[Napoleon I|Napoleon]] gave his marshals much more tactical freedom.&lt;ref&gt;Jac Weller, ''Wellington at Waterloo'' (London 1967) p. 21&lt;/ref&gt; At the critical meeting of the two generals at the [[Battle of Waterloo]] — where Wellington's close supervision contrasted strongly with the effective delegation of operational management by Napoleon to [[Marshall Ney]]&lt;ref&gt;James Marshall-Cornwall, ''Napoleon as Military Commander'' (London 1967) p. 278&lt;/ref&gt; — it was at least arguably Wellington's control mania that played the decisive role in the Allied victory, justifying his claim the following day that “I don't think it would have been done if I had not been there”.&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in Glover, p. 204&lt;/ref&gt;

===Queen Victoria===
A series of three documentary programs on [[BBC2]] in the UK in January 2013 called ''Queen Victoria's Children'' argued that [[Queen Victoria]] was a pathological control freak by the way she controlled the welfare of all her children.&lt;ref&gt;Queen Victoria's Children BBC2 January 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

===Steve Jobs and closed systems===
[[Steve Jobs#Management style|Steve Jobs]] was a perfectionist who favored the closed system of control over all aspects of a product from start to finish — what he termed the integrated over the fragmented approach.&lt;ref&gt;Walter Isaacson, ''Steve Jobs'' (2011) p. 564 and p. 513&lt;/ref&gt; As [[Steve Wozniak]], his long-term collaborator and occasional critic, put it: "Apple gets you into their playpen and keeps you there.&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in Isaacson, p. 497&lt;/ref&gt; The triumph of the Windows PC over the Mac was a blow for that philosophy, a situation that was then reversed by the successes of the iPod, iPhone, and iPad &amp;ndash; only for the Android challenge to reopen the debate."&lt;ref&gt;Isaacson, p. 513 and p. 497&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1118">'''Convergence''' in [[sustainability science]]s refers to mechanisms and pathways that lead towards [[sustainability]] with a specific focus on 'Equity within biological planetary limits'. These pathways and mechanisms explicitly advocate equity and recognise the need for redistribution of the Earth's resources in order for human society to operate enduringly within the Earth's biophysical limits.

This use of the term 'convergence' harkens from the concept of [[contraction and convergence]] (C&amp;C), taking its core principles of Equity and Survival and applying them beyond the frame of [[greenhouse gas emissions]] to the wider sustainability agenda.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Fortnam|first=Matt|title=Convergence:   How can it be a part of the   pathway to sustainability?|url=http://www.convergeproject.org/node/51|publisher=The CONVERGE project website|accessdate=1 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''denomination effect''' is a form of [[cognitive bias]] relating to [[currency]], suggesting people may be less likely to spend larger currency denominations than their equivalent value in smaller denominations.&lt;ref name="Business Insider - Kane"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Kane|first1=Libby|title=15 cognitive biases that could keep you from building wealth|url=http://www.businessinsider.com/cognitive-biases-affect-wealth-2016-9/#anchoring-bias-3|accessdate=25 January 2017|publisher=Business Insider|date=September 9, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was proposed by Priya Raghubir, professor at the [[New York University Stern School of Business]], and Joydeep Srivastava, professor at [[University of Maryland, College Park|University of Maryland]], in their 2009 paper "Denomination Effect".&lt;ref name="NPR"&gt;{{cite news|title=Why We Spend Coins Faster Than Bills|url=https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=104063298|accessdate=24 January 2017|publisher=NPR|date=May 12, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Raghubir|Srivastava|2009|p=701}}

Raghubir and Srivastava conducted three studies in their research on the denomination effect; their findings suggested people may be more likely to spend money represented by smaller denominations and that consumers may prefer to receive money in a large denomination when there is a need to control spending. The denomination effect can occur when large denominations are perceived as less exchangeable than smaller denominations.

The effect's influence on spending decisions has implications throughout various sectors in society, including [[Welfare economics|consumer welfare]], [[monetary policy]] and the [[Financial services|finance industry]]. For example, during the [[Great Recession]], one businessman observed employees using more coins rather than banknotes in an office vending machine, perceiving the customers used coins to feel thriftier. Raghubir and Srivastava also suggested the effect may involve incentives to alter future behavior and that a large denomination can serve as a mechanism to prevent the urge to spend.

==Raghubir and Srivastava experiment==
[[File:Exchange Money Conversion to Foreign Currency.jpg|thumb|The denomination effect influences spending decisions.]]
Raghubir and Srivastava conducted three distinct studies as part of their experiment. Their first experiment involved 89 [[undergraduate]] students from two United States universities. As a cover story, the students were thanked for their participation and randomly given  either a small [[Denomination (currency)|denomination]] (four quarters) or a large denomination ($1 bill) and told they could keep or spend the money on confectionery. Small denominations were given to 43 students (48% of study group) and 46 students (52% of study group) were given large denominations. Approximately 44% (39/89) of the participants, in both conditions, chose to purchase confectionery. About 63% of the participants with the four quarters purchased candy, yet only 26% of the participants with the $1 bill spent money, suggesting the students were more inclined to spend when given a smaller denomination.{{sfn|Raghubir|Srivastava|2009|p=701}}

In a second study, 75 gas-station customers were each asked to participate in a short survey on gas usage. Each participant was given $5 as either five $1 bills, five $1 coins or one $5 bill and told they could spend the money at the gas station store. Customers who were given five $1 bills were more likely to buy something compared to customers receiving a single $5 bill. Customers who received five $1 coins had the lowest likelihood of spending, however the currency is in low-circulation and some are retained as [[souvenir]]s.{{sfn|Raghubir|Srivastava|2009|p=705}}

A third study sought to understand whether the effect was particular to American culture. In China, 150 housewives were given an envelope of money in exchange for completing a survey, containing either a single [[Renminbi]] (CNY) 100 banknote or five banknotes of equivalent value (in 2009, CNY 100 was equivalent to roughly $14.63 [[USD]] or €10.40 [[EUR]]&lt;ref name="currency_conv"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.x-rates.com/average/?from=CNY&amp;to=USD&amp;amount=1&amp;year=2009 |title=Historic exchange rate: CNY to USB as of 2009 |publisher=X-Rates |access-date=29 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;). The cash represented a significant amount of money based on the monthly income of the participants, as 18.7% (28/150) earned less than CNY 300, 65% earned (97/150) between CNY 301 and 600 and 16.7% (25/150) earned over CNY 600. The average household size was about 3.3 people in both conditions. Some who purchased household items were less satisfied if they had received a large banknote, compared to the others who felt more satisfied spending smaller denominations.{{sfn|Raghubir|Srivastava|2009|p=704-706}}

==Early studies==
[[File:Credit-cards.jpg|thumb|Alternate payment methods]]
One study, conducted by marketing professors Arul Mishra, Himanshu Mishra and Dhananjay Nayakankuppam in 2006, documented a phenomenon whereby consumers spent less of a large denomination, but not with smaller denominations.&lt;ref name="Advances in Consumer Research"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Mishra|first1=Arul|last2=Mishra|first2=Himanshu|last3=Nayakankuppam|first3=Dhananjay|title=Money: a Bias For the Whole|journal=Advances in Consumer Research|volume=34|page=166|url=http://www.acrwebsite.org/volumes/v34/500822_100201_v1.pdf|accessdate=24 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the study, they concluded that people give higher value to a large single denomination because it is more difficult to process the transaction, leading people to overvalue it and make them less likely to spend compared to an identical amount in smaller denominations. Unlike Mishra et al., who studied purchase intentions, Raghubir and Srivastava examined actual purchase decisions.{{sfn|Raghubir|Srivastava|2009|p=701,702,704,706}}

Previous research by Raghubir and Srivastava in 2008 found a higher inclination to spend using alternative payment methods, such as a credit or gift cards.{{sfn|Raghubir|Srivastava|2009|p=701,712}} Their experiment built on earlier research studies, including one by [[Harvard]] business professor [[John Gourville]] in 1998,{{sfn|Gourville|1998|p=395-498}} which showed that people are more likely to analyze a transaction positively when the same amount of money is presented as an equally distributed sum each day instead of a single lump sum each year.{{sfn|Raghubir|Srivastava|2009|p=701}}

==Conclusions==
Raghubir and Srivastava concluded in study 1 that people are more likely to spend when an equivalent amount of money is represented by a smaller denomination relative to a single large denomination. In study 2, they concluded that consumers prefer to receive money in a large denomination compared to small denominations when there is a need to control spending. Study 3 further proves that the denomination effect depends on an individual's desire to reduce the uneasy feeling associated with spending money. The denomination effect occurs because people perceive a large denomination as less replaceable than smaller denominations, which can be used to control and regulate spending.{{sfn|Raghubir|Srivastava|2009|p=701-713}}

In 2009, Sean Gregory with ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' magazine explained that consumers view large denominations as more valuable than smaller denominations and that they tend to isolate the cash in their minds. Each smaller denomination $20 bill, he noted, is a less valuable entity than the single large denomination $100 bill. It's easier to spend five $20 bills than it is to spend a single $100 bill. Gregory also added that consumers fear breaking a single large denomination because they won't be able to stop spending the change.&lt;ref name="Time"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Gregory|first1=Sean|title=Want to Save Money? Carry Around $100 Bills|url=http://content.time.com/time/business/article/0,8599,1887485,00.html|accessdate=24 January 2017|publisher=Time|date=March 27, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The researchers suggested that the denomination effect may involve imposing self-constraints or [[incentive]]s to alter future behavior, noting a large denomination can serve as a [[precommitment]] mechanism to prevent the urge to spend compared to small denominations.{{sfn|Raghubir|Srivastava|2009|p=702-704}}

==Applications==
Raghubir and Srivastava believe the influence of denomination on spending decisions has implications on consumer welfare and [[monetary policy]].{{sfn|Raghubir|Srivastava|2009|p=712}} Raghubir suggested offering smaller denominations to encourage spending and proposed increasing circulation of $1 coins and introduce $2 coins in the United States.&lt;ref name="NPR"/&gt;

[[File:Stockmarket.jpg|thumb|The denomination effect has implications in buying and selling stocks.]]
In 2012, Gary Belsky and Tom Gilovich of ''Time'' magazine stated that Raghubir and Srivastava's results were consistent with what they called ''mental accounting'', suggesting small denomination banknotes tend to get assigned to a "mental petty cash account" to spend on trivial things. In contrast, larger denomination banknotes are perceived as "real money" and likely to spend on things of greater importance.&lt;ref name="Time - Bill size"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Gilovich|first1=Tom|last2=Belsky|first2=Gary|title=Why (Bill) Size Really Does Matter|url=http://business.time.com/2012/01/26/why-bill-size-really-does-matter/|accessdate=25 January 2017|publisher=Time|date=January 26, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Economic Times"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Riju|first1=Dave|title=Going shopping?

A 2009 [[National Public Radio]] report noted that as the [[recession]] worsened, a [[Sacramento]] businessman noticed that people were using more coins, rather than banknotes, in his office [[vending machine]]. The businessman believed the consumers were feeling economic hardship and that using coins instead of banknotes made them feel thriftier.&lt;ref name="NPR"/&gt;

John Manning, columnist at the ''International Banker'', noted the effect surfaces in the finance field, when an asset's unit of value exposes an investor's tendency to spend less when given in larger amounts. Manning cited the example of a [[stock split]], suggesting the number of shares is increased by a certain ratio and diminished in price by the same factor, so that the company's total [[equity value]] remains the same. Stock splits are done largely because of the denomination effect, as the belief is that a less expensive share price can increase stock demand.&lt;ref name="International Banker"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Manning|first1=John|title=Cognitive Bias Series: 6.

'''Desert X''' is a [[Site-specific art|site-specific]], [[contemporary art]] exhibition that was installed in the [[Coachella Valley]] in California from February 25 to April 30, 2017.  

==Background==
Desert X was formed by Desert Biennial, a [[501(c) organization|501(C)]] charitable organization founded in 2015.  The exhibit is meant to bring attention to the valley's environment through the display of works by emerging artists. Themes include [[climate change]], [[immigration]], [[tourism]], [[Indian gambling|gambling]], and [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American culture]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Anna Rumer |url=http://www.desertsun.com/story/life/entertainment/arts/2017/02/25/massive-desert-x-art-exhibit-debuts-palm-springs-area/98404980/ |title=Massive Desert X art exhibit debuts in Palm Springs area |publisher=Desertsun.com |date=2017-02-25 |accessdate=2017-04-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Christopher Knight |url = http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/arts/la-ca-cm-desert-x-coachella-review-20170309-htmlstory.html|title= International art invades the suburban Coachella Valley: The best of 'Desert X' |publisher = latimes.com |date = 2017-03-09|accessdate=2017-04-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.desertsun.com/story/life/entertainment/arts/2017/03/16/how-desert-x-concept-making-art-accessible-became-reality/99217496/|title= How Desert X concept of making art accessible became a reality |publisher = desertsun.com |date = |accessdate=2017-04-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''deva''' in the [[New Age movement]] refers to any of the spiritual forces or beings behind [[nature]].  The origin of the word 'deva' comes from the Sanskrit language. According to [[Theosophy (Blavatskian)|Theosophist]] [[Charles Webster Leadbeater]] devas represent a separate [[Evolution (philosophy)|evolution]] to that of [[human race|humanity]]. The concept of devas as nature-spirits was further developed in the writings of Theosophist [[Geoffrey Hodson]]. It is believed that there are numerous different types of devas with a population in the millions performing different functions on Earth to help the [[ecology]] function better.  It is asserted they can be observed by those whose [[third eye]]s have been activated.&lt;ref name="Hodson, Geoffrey 1952"&gt;Hodson, Geoffrey, ''Kingdom of the Gods''. 1952. {{ISBN|0-7661-8134-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition, it is believed by Theosophists that there are millions of devas living inside the [[Sun]], the indwelling [[solar deity]] of which Theosophists call the ''[[Spiritual Hierarchy#Cosmic beings functioning within the Sun|Solar Logos]]''—these devas are called ''solar angels'', or sometimes ''solar devas'' or ''solar spirits''.  Sometimes, it is believed, they visit Earth and can be observed, like other devas, by humans whose third eyes have been activated.&lt;ref name="Hodson, Geoffrey 1952"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Leadbeater, C.W  ''A Textbook of Theosophy''. 1912.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Powell, A.E. ''The Solar System: A Complete Outline of the Theosophical Scheme of Evolution''. London:1930. The Theosophical Publishing House. See the chart on page 44 called "The Evolution of Life"--this ''lifewave chart'' shows the various life forms that evolving souls inhabit as they reincarnate. The ''solar spirits'' living inside the Sun are shown at the top of the chart as the most advanced life forms in our [[solar system]].&lt;/ref&gt; Theosophists believe that there are also devas living inside all the other [[star]]s besides [[Sun|Sol]]; these are called ''stellar angels''.

In the [[Findhorn Foundation|Findhorn]] material, the term refers to [[archetype|archetypal]] spiritual intelligences behind species, in other words the group soul of a species.

Some New Age sources use the term as a generic term to designate any being regarded as being composed of [[Etheric plane|etheric matter]]--[[elemental]]s, [[nature spirit]]s (including the various types of nature spirits such as [[fairy|fairies]], [[Undine (alchemy)|ondines]], etc.). The pre-New Age etymology of the term is described in the article [[Deva (Hinduism)]].

Diffraction processes affecting [[wave]]s are amenable to [[Quantity|quantitative]] description and analysis. Such treatments are applied to a wave passing through one or more slits whose width is specified as a proportion of the [[wavelength]]. [[Numerical approximation]]s may be used, including the [[Fresnel approximation|Fresnel]] and [[Fraunhofer diffraction|Fraunhofer approximation]]s.

|}

== General diffraction ==
Because diffraction is the result of addition of all waves (of given wavelength) along all unobstructed paths, the usual procedure is to consider the contribution of an infinitesimally small neighborhood around a certain path (this contribution is usually called a [[wavelet]]) and then integrate over all paths (= add all wavelets) from the source to the detector (or given point on a screen). 

Thus in order to determine the pattern produced by diffraction, the phase and the amplitude of each of the wavelets is calculated. That is, at each point in space we must determine the distance to each of the simple sources on the incoming wavefront. If the distance to each of the simple sources differs by an integer number of wavelengths, all the wavelets will be in phase, resulting in constructive interference. If the distance to each source is an integer plus one half of a wavelength, there will be complete destructive interference. Usually, it is sufficient to determine these minima and maxima to explain the observed diffraction effects.  

The simplest descriptions of diffraction are those in which the situation can be reduced to a two-dimensional problem. For water waves, this is already the case, as water waves propagate only on the surface of the water. For light, we can often neglect one dimension if the diffracting object extends in that direction over a distance far greater than the wavelength. In the case of light shining through small circular holes we will have to take into account the full three-dimensional nature of the problem.

Several qualitative observations can be made of diffraction in general:
* The angular spacing of the features in the diffraction pattern is inversely proportional to the dimensions of the object causing the diffraction. In other words: the smaller the diffracting object, the wider the resulting diffraction pattern, and vice versa. (More precisely, this is true of the [[sine]]s of the angles.)
* The diffraction angles are invariant under scaling; that is, they depend only on the ratio of the wavelength to the size of the diffracting object.
* When the diffracting object has a periodic structure, for example in a diffraction grating, the features generally become sharper. The fourth figure, for example, shows a comparison of a [[Double-slit experiment|double-slit]] pattern with a pattern formed by five slits, both sets of slits having the same spacing between the center of one slit and the next.

==Approximations==
The problem of calculating what a diffracted wave looks like, is the problem of determining the phase of each of the simple sources on the incoming wave front. It is mathematically easier to consider the case of far-field or [[Fraunhofer diffraction]], where the point of observation is far from that of the diffracting obstruction, and as a result, involves less complex mathematics than the more general case of near-field or [[Fresnel diffraction]]. To make this statement more quantitative, let us consider a diffracting object at the origin that has a size &lt;math&gt;\ a&lt;/math&gt;. For definiteness let us say we are diffracting light and we are interested in what the intensity looks like on a screen a distance &lt;math&gt;\ L&lt;/math&gt; away from the object. At some point on the screen the path length to one side of the object is given by the Pythagorean theorem
:&lt;math&gt;S =\sqrt{L^2+(x+a/2)^2}&lt;/math&gt;{{Elucidate|date=August 2015}}
If we now consider the situation where &lt;math&gt;\ L&gt;&gt;(x+a/2)&lt;/math&gt;, the path length becomes
:&lt;math&gt;S\approx\left(L+\frac{(x+a/2)^2}{2 L}\right)= L + \frac{x^2}{2L}+\frac{x a}{2L}+\frac{a^2}{8L}&lt;/math&gt;
This is the Fresnel approximation. To further simplify things: If the diffracting object is much smaller than the distance &lt;math&gt;\ L&lt;/math&gt;, the last term will contribute much less than a wavelength to the path length, and will then not change the phase appreciably. That is &lt;math&gt;\frac{a^2}{L}&lt;&lt;\lambda&lt;/math&gt;. The result is the Fraunhofer approximation, which is only valid very far away from the object 
:&lt;math&gt;S \approx L + \frac{x^2}{2L}+\frac{x a}{2L}&lt;/math&gt;
Depending on the size of the diffraction object, the distance to the object and the wavelength of the wave, the Fresnel approximation, the Fraunhofer approximation or neither approximation may be valid. As the distance between the measured point of diffraction and the obstruction point increases, the diffraction patterns or results predicted converge towards those of Fraunhofer diffraction, which is more often observed in nature due to the extremely small wavelength of visible light.

== Diffraction from an array of narrow slits==

===A simple quantitative description===
[[Image:TwoSlitInterference.svg|right|thumb|Diagram of a two slit diffraction problem, showing the angle to the first minimum, where a path length difference of a half wavelength causes destructive interference.]]

Multiple-slit arrangements can be mathematically considered as multiple simple wave sources, if the slits are narrow enough. For light, a slit is an opening that is infinitely extended in one dimension, and this has the effect of reducing a wave problem in 3D-space to a simpler problem in 2D-space. 
The simplest case is that of two narrow slits, spaced a distance &lt;math&gt;\ a&lt;/math&gt; apart. To determine the maxima and minima in the amplitude we must determine the path difference to the first slit and to the second one. In the Fraunhofer approximation, with the observer far away from the slits, the difference in path length to the two slits can be seen from the image to be
:&lt;math&gt;\ \Delta S={a} \sin \theta&lt;/math&gt;
Maxima in the intensity occur if this path length difference is an integer number of wavelengths.

:{|
|-
|&lt;math&gt;\ {a} \sin \theta = n \lambda &lt;/math&gt; || &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; || rowspan=4 |
:where
:&lt;math&gt;\ n&lt;/math&gt; is an [[integer]] that labels the ''order'' of each maximum,
:&lt;math&gt;\ \lambda&lt;/math&gt; is the wavelength,
:&lt;math&gt;\ a&lt;/math&gt; is the distance between the slits
: and &lt;math&gt;\ \theta&lt;/math&gt; is the angle at which constructive interference occurs.
|-
|
|}

The corresponding minima are at path differences of an integer number plus one half of the wavelength:
:&lt;math&gt; {a} \sin \theta = \lambda (n+1/2) \,&lt;/math&gt;.

For an array of slits, positions of the minima and maxima are not changed, the ''fringes'' visible on a screen however do become sharper, as can be seen in the image.

===Mathematical description===
To calculate this intensity pattern, one needs to introduce some more sophisticated methods. The mathematical representation of a radial wave is given by

:&lt;math&gt;\ E(r) = A \cos (k r - \omega t + \phi)/r&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\ k=\frac{2 \pi}{\lambda}&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\ \lambda&lt;/math&gt; is the wavelength, &lt;math&gt;\ \omega&lt;/math&gt; is frequency of the wave and &lt;math&gt;\ \phi&lt;/math&gt; is the phase of the wave at the slits at time t=0. The wave at a screen some distance away from the plane of the slits is given by the sum of the waves emanating from each of the slits. 
To make this problem a little easier, we introduce the complex wave &lt;math&gt;\ \Psi&lt;/math&gt;, the real part of which is equal to &lt;math&gt;\ E&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\ \Psi(r)=A e^{i (k r-\omega t +\phi)}/r&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\ E(r)=Re(\Psi(r))&lt;/math&gt;
The absolute value of this function gives the wave amplitude, and the complex phase of the function corresponds to the phase of the wave. &lt;math&gt;\ \Psi&lt;/math&gt; is referred to as the complex amplitude.
With &lt;math&gt;\ N&lt;/math&gt; slits, the total wave at point &lt;math&gt;\ x&lt;/math&gt; on the screen is
:&lt;math&gt;\Psi_{total}=A e^{i(-\omega t +\phi)}\sum_{n=0}^{N-1} \frac{e^{i k \sqrt{(x-n a)^2+L^2}}}{\sqrt{(x-n a)^2+L^2}}&lt;/math&gt;.

Since we are for the moment only interested in the amplitude and relative phase, we can ignore any overall phase factors that are not dependent on &lt;math&gt;\ x&lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt;\ n&lt;/math&gt;. We approximate &lt;math&gt;\sqrt{(x-n a)^2+L^2}\approx L+ (x-na)^2/2L&lt;/math&gt;. In the [[Fraunhofer limit]] we can neglect terms of order :&lt;math&gt;\frac{a^2}{2L}&lt;/math&gt; in the exponential, and any terms involving &lt;math&gt;\ a/L&lt;/math&gt;  or &lt;math&gt;\ x/L&lt;/math&gt; in the denominator. The sum becomes
:&lt;math&gt;\Psi=A \frac{e^{i\left( k (\frac{x^2}{2 L}+L)-\omega t +\phi\right)}}{L}\sum_{n=0}^{N-1} e^{-i k \frac{x n a}{L}}&lt;/math&gt;

The sum has the form of a [[Geometric progression|geometric sum]] and can be evaluated to give

:&lt;math&gt;\Psi=A \frac{e^{i\left( k (\frac{x^2-(N-1)ax}{2 L}+L)-\omega t +\phi\right)}}{L} \frac {\sin\left(\frac{Nkax}{2L}\right)} {\sin\left(\frac{kax}{2L}\right)}&lt;/math&gt;

The intensity is given by the absolute value of the complex amplitude squared 
:&lt;math&gt;I(x)=\Psi \Psi^*=|\Psi|^2=I_0\left( \frac{\sin\left(\frac{Nkax}{2L}\right)}{\sin\left(\frac{kax}{2L}\right)}\right)^2 &lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\Psi^*&lt;/math&gt; denotes the [[complex conjugate]] of &lt;math&gt;\Psi&lt;/math&gt;.

==Quantitative analysis of single-slit diffraction==
[[File:Wavelength=slitwidthblue3D.gif|thumb|Numerical approximation of diffraction pattern from a slit of width equal to wavelength of an incident plane wave in 3D blue visualization]]
[[Image:Wave Diffraction 4Lambda Slit.png|right|thumb|300px|Numerical approximation of diffraction pattern from a slit of width four wavelengths with an incident plane wave. The main central beam, nulls, and phase reversals are apparent.]]
[[Image:Single_Slit_Diffraction_(english).svg|right|thumb|300px|Graph and image of single-slit diffraction]]

As an example, an exact equation can now be derived for the intensity of the diffraction pattern as a function of angle in the case of single-slit diffraction. 

A mathematical representation of [[Huygens' principle]] can be used to start an equation.

Consider a monochromatic complex plane wave &lt;math&gt;\Psi^\prime&lt;/math&gt; of wavelength λ incident on a slit of width ''a''. 

If the slit lies in the x&amp;prime;-y&amp;prime; plane, with its center at the origin, then it can be assumed that diffraction generates a complex wave ψ, traveling radially in the r direction away from the slit, and this is given by:

:&lt;math&gt;\Psi = \int_{\mathrm{slit}} \frac{i}{r\lambda} \Psi^\prime e^{-ikr}\,d\mathrm{slit}&lt;/math&gt;

Let (x&amp;prime;,y&amp;prime;,0) be a point inside the slit over which it is being integrated. If  (x,0,z) is the location at which the intensity of the diffraction pattern is being computed, the slit extends from &lt;math&gt;x^\prime=-a/2&lt;/math&gt;  to &lt;math&gt;+a/2\,&lt;/math&gt;, and from &lt;math&gt;y'=-\infty&lt;/math&gt; to &lt;math&gt;\infty&lt;/math&gt;.

The distance ''r'' from the slot is: 

:&lt;math&gt;r = \sqrt{\left(x - x^\prime\right)^2 + y^{\prime2} + z^2}&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;r = z \left(1 + \frac{\left(x - x^\prime\right)^2 + y^{\prime2}}{z^2}\right)^\frac{1}{2}&lt;/math&gt;

Assuming [[Fraunhofer diffraction]] will result in the conclusion &lt;math&gt;z \gg \big|\left(x - x^\prime\right)\big|&lt;/math&gt;.  In other words, the distance to the target is much larger than the diffraction width on the target.
By the [[binomial expansion]] rule, ignoring terms quadratic and higher, the quantity on the right can be estimated to be:

:&lt;math&gt;r \approx z \left( 1 + \frac{1}{2} \frac{\left(x - x^\prime \right)^2 + y^{\prime 2}}{z^2} \right)&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;r \approx z + \frac{\left(x - x^\prime\right)^2 + y^{\prime 2}}{2z}&lt;/math&gt;

It can be seen that 1/''r'' in front of the equation is non-oscillatory, i.e. its contribution to the magnitude of the intensity is small compared to our exponential factors.  Therefore, we will lose little accuracy by approximating it as ''1/z''.

{|
|-
|&lt;math&gt;\Psi \,&lt;/math&gt;
|&lt;math&gt;= \frac{i \Psi^\prime}{z \lambda} \int_{-\frac{a}{2}}^{\frac{a}{2}}\int_{-\infty}^{\infty} e^{-ik\left[z+\frac{ \left(x - x^\prime \right)^2 + y^{\prime 2}}{2z}\right]} \,dy^\prime \,dx^\prime&lt;/math&gt;
|-
|
|&lt;math&gt;= \frac{i \Psi^\prime}{z \lambda} e^{-ikz} \int_{-\frac{a}{2}}^{\frac{a}{2}}e^{-ik\left[\frac{\left(x - x^\prime \right)^2}{2z}\right]} \,dx^\prime \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} e^{-ik\left[\frac{y^{\prime 2}}{2z}\right]} \,dy^\prime&lt;/math&gt;
|-
|
|&lt;math&gt;=\Psi^\prime \sqrt{\frac{i}{z\lambda}} e^\frac{-ikx^2}{2z} \int_{-\frac{a}{2}}^{\frac{a}{2}}e^\frac{ikxx^\prime}{z} e^\frac{-ikx^{\prime 2}}{2z} \,dx^\prime&lt;/math&gt;
|-
|}

To make things cleaner, a placeholder 'C' is used to denote constants in the equation.  It is important to keep in mind that C can contain imaginary numbers, thus the wave function will be complex. However, at the end, the ψ will be bracketed, which will eliminate any imaginary components.

Now, in Fraunhofer diffraction, &lt;math&gt;kx^{\prime 2}/z&lt;/math&gt; is small, so &lt;math&gt;e^\frac{-ikx^{\prime 2}}{2z} \approx 1&lt;/math&gt; (note that &lt;math&gt;x^\prime&lt;/math&gt; participates in this exponential and it is being integrated).

In contrast the term &lt;math&gt;e^\frac{-ikx^2}{2z}&lt;/math&gt; can be eliminated from the equation, since when bracketed it gives 1.
:&lt;math&gt;\langle e^\frac{-ikx^2}{2z}|e^\frac{-ikx^2}{2z} \rangle=e^\frac{-ikx^2}{2z} (e^\frac{-ikx^2}{2z})^*=e^\frac{-ikx^2}{2z} e^\frac{+ikx^2}{2z}=e^0=1&lt;/math&gt;

(For the same reason we have also eliminated the term &lt;math&gt;e^{-ikz}&lt;/math&gt;)

Taking &lt;math&gt;C = \Psi^\prime \sqrt{\frac{i}{z\lambda}}&lt;/math&gt; results in:

{|
|-
|&lt;math&gt;\Psi\, &lt;/math&gt;
|&lt;math&gt;= C \int_{-\frac{a}{2}}^{\frac{a}{2}}e^\frac{ikxx^\prime}{z} \,dx^\prime&lt;/math&gt;
|-
|
|&lt;math&gt;=C \frac{\left(e^\frac{ikax}{2z} - e^\frac{-ikax}{2z}\right)}{\frac{ikx}{z}}&lt;/math&gt;
|}

It can be noted through [[Euler's formula]] and its derivatives that &lt;math&gt;\sin x = \frac{e^{ix} - e^{-ix}}{2i}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\sin \theta = \frac{x}{z}&lt;/math&gt;. 

&lt;math&gt;\Psi = aC \frac{\sin\frac{ka\sin\theta}{2}}{\frac{ka\sin\theta}{2}} = aC \left[ \operatorname{sinc} \left( \frac{ka\sin\theta}{2} \right) \right]&lt;/math&gt;

where the (unnormalized) [[sinc function]] is defined by &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{sinc}(x) \ \stackrel{\mathrm{def}}{=}\  \frac{\operatorname{sin}(x)}{x}&lt;/math&gt;.

Now, substituting in &lt;math&gt;\frac{2\pi}{\lambda} = k&lt;/math&gt;, the intensity (squared amplitude) &lt;math&gt;I&lt;/math&gt; of the diffracted waves at an angle θ is given by:

{|
|-
|&lt;math&gt;I(\theta)\, &lt;/math&gt;
|
|&lt;math&gt;= I_0 {\left[ \operatorname{sinc} \left( \frac{\pi a}{\lambda} \sin \theta \right) \right] }^2 &lt;/math&gt;
|}

==Quantitative analysis of ''N''-slit diffraction==
[[Image:Laserdiffraction.jpg|right|frame|Double-slit diffraction of red laser light]]

[[Image:Diffraction2vs5.jpg|right|frame|2-slit and 5-slit diffraction]]

Let us again start with the mathematical representation of [[Huygens' principle]].

:&lt;math&gt;\Psi = \int_{\mathrm{slit}} \frac{i}{r\lambda} \Psi^\prime e^{-ikr}\,d\mathrm{slit}&lt;/math&gt;

Consider &lt;math&gt;N&lt;/math&gt; slits in the prime plane of equal size &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt; and spacing &lt;math&gt;d&lt;/math&gt; spread along the &lt;math&gt;x^\prime&lt;/math&gt; axis.  As above, the distance &lt;math&gt;r&lt;/math&gt; from slit 1 is:

:&lt;math&gt;r = z \left(1 + \frac{\left(x - x^\prime\right)^2 + y^{\prime2}}{z^2}\right)^\frac{1}{2}&lt;/math&gt;

To generalize this to &lt;math&gt;N&lt;/math&gt; slits, we make the observation that while &lt;math&gt;z&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt; remain constant, &lt;math&gt;x^\prime&lt;/math&gt; shifts by 

:&lt;math&gt;x_{j=0 \cdots n-1}^{\prime} = x_0^\prime - j d &lt;/math&gt;

Thus 

:&lt;math&gt;r_j = z \left(1 + \frac{\left(x - x^\prime - j d \right)^2 + y^{\prime2}}{z^2}\right)^\frac{1}{2}&lt;/math&gt;

and the sum of all &lt;math&gt;N&lt;/math&gt; contributions to the wave function is:

:&lt;math&gt;\Psi = \sum_{j=0}^{N-1} C \int_{-\frac{a}{2}}^{\frac{a}{2}} e^\frac{ikx\left(x^\prime - jd\right)}{z} e^\frac{-ik\left(x^\prime - jd\right)^2}{2z} \,dx^\prime&lt;/math&gt;

Again noting that &lt;math&gt;\frac{k\left(x^\prime -jd\right)^2}{z}&lt;/math&gt; is small, so &lt;math&gt;e^\frac{-ik\left(x^\prime -jd\right)^2}{2z} \approx 1&lt;/math&gt;, we have:

{|
|-
|&lt;math&gt;\Psi\, &lt;/math&gt;
|&lt;math&gt;= C\sum_{j=0}^{N-1} \int_{-\frac{a}{2}}^{\frac{a}{2}} e^\frac{ikx\left(x^\prime - jd\right)}{z} \,dx^\prime&lt;/math&gt;
|-
|
|&lt;math&gt;= a C \sum_{j=0}^{N-1} \frac{\left(e^{\frac{ikax}{2z} - \frac{ijkxd}{z}}  - e^{\frac{-ikax}{2z}-\frac{ijkxd}{z}}\right)}{\frac{2ikax}{2z}}&lt;/math&gt;
|-
|
|&lt;math&gt;= a C \sum_{j=0}^{N-1} e^\frac{ijkxd}{z} \frac{\left(e^\frac{ikax}{2z} - e^\frac{-ikax}{2z}\right)}{\frac{2ikax}{2z}}&lt;/math&gt;
|-
|
|&lt;math&gt;= a C \frac{\sin\frac{ka\sin\theta}{2}}{\frac{ka\sin\theta}{2}} \sum_{j=0}^{N-1} e^{ijkd\sin\theta}&lt;/math&gt;
|}

Now, we can use the following identity

&lt;math&gt;\sum_{j=0}^{N-1} e^{x j} = \frac{1 - e^{Nx}}{1 - e^x}.&lt;/math&gt;

Substituting into our equation, we find:

{|
|-
|&lt;math&gt;\Psi\, &lt;/math&gt;
|&lt;math&gt;= a C \frac{\sin\frac{ka\sin\theta}{2}}{\frac{ka\sin\theta}{2}}\left(\frac{1 - e^{iNkd\sin\theta}}{1 - e^{ikd\sin\theta}}\right)&lt;/math&gt;
|-
|
|&lt;math&gt;= a C \frac{\sin\frac{ka\sin\theta}{2}}{\frac{ka\sin\theta}{2}}\left(\frac{e^{-iNkd\frac{\sin\theta}{2}}-e^{iNkd\frac{\sin\theta}{2}}}{e^{-ikd\frac{\sin\theta}{2}}-e^{ikd\frac{\sin\theta}{2}}}\right)\left(\frac{e^{iNkd\frac{\sin\theta}{2}}}{e^{ikd\frac{\sin\theta}{2}}}\right)&lt;/math&gt;
|-
|
|&lt;math&gt;= a C \frac{\sin\frac{ka\sin\theta}{2}}{\frac{ka\sin\theta}{2}}\frac{\frac{e^{-iNkd \frac{\sin\theta}{2}} - e^{iNkd\frac{\sin\theta}{2}}}{2i}}{\frac{e^{-ikd\frac{\sin\theta}{2}} - e^{ikd\frac{\sin\theta}{2}}}{2i}} \left(e^{i(N-1)kd\frac{\sin\theta}{2}}\right)&lt;/math&gt;
|-
|
|&lt;math&gt;= a C \frac{\sin\left(\frac{ka\sin\theta}{2}\right)}{\frac{ka\sin\theta}{2}} \frac{\sin\left(\frac{Nkd\sin\theta}{2}\right)} {\sin\left(\frac{kd\sin\theta}{2}\right)}e^{i\left(N-1\right)kd\frac{\sin\theta}{2}} &lt;/math&gt;
|}

We now make our &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt; substitution as before and represent all non-oscillating constants by the &lt;math&gt;I_0&lt;/math&gt; variable as in the 1-slit diffraction and bracket the result.  Remember that 

:&lt;math&gt;\langle e^{ix} \Big| e^{ix}\rangle\ = e^0 = 1&lt;/math&gt;

This allows us to discard the tailing exponent and we have our answer:

:&lt;math&gt;I\left(\theta\right) = I_0 \left[ \operatorname{sinc} \left( \frac{\pi a}{\lambda} \sin \theta \right) \right]^2 \cdot \left[\frac{\sin\left(\frac{N\pi d}{\lambda}\sin\theta\right)}{\sin\left(\frac{\pi d}{\lambda}\sin\theta\right)}\right]^2&lt;/math&gt;

==General case for far field==
In the far field, where r is essentially constant, then the equation:

:&lt;math&gt;\Psi = \int_{\mathrm{slit}} \frac{i}{r\lambda} \Psi^\prime e^{-ikr}\,d\mathrm{slit}&lt;/math&gt;

is equivalent to doing a [[fourier transform]] on the gaps in the barrier.&lt;ref&gt;J. M. Rodenburg, [http://www.rodenburg.org/theory/y1300.html The Fourier Transform]&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2290">In the [[mathematics|mathematical]] theory of [[dynamical systems]], an '''exponential dichotomy''' is a property of an [[equilibrium point]] that extends the idea of [[hyperbolic equilibrium point|hyperbolicity]] to non-[[autonomous system (mathematics)|autonomous system]]s.

==Definition==
If

:&lt;math&gt;\dot{\mathbf{x}} = A(t)\mathbf{x}&lt;/math&gt;

is a [[linear system|linear]] non-autonomous dynamical system in '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt; with [[fundamental solution matrix]] Φ(''t''), Φ(0) = ''I'', then the equilibrium point '''0''' is said to have an ''exponential dichotomy'' if there exists a (constant) [[matrix (mathematics)|matrix]] ''P'' such that ''P''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = ''P'' and positive constants ''K'', ''L'', α, and β such that

:&lt;math&gt;|| \Phi(t) P \Phi^{-1}(s) || \le Ke^{-\alpha(t - s)}\mbox{ for }s \le t &lt; \infty&lt;/math&gt;

and

:&lt;math&gt;|| \Phi(t) (I - P) \Phi^{-1}(s) || \le Le^{-\beta(s - t)}\mbox{ for }s \ge t &gt; -\infty.&lt;/math&gt;

If furthermore, ''L'' = 1/''K'' and β = α, then '''0''' is said to have a ''uniform exponential dichotomy''.

The constants α and β allow us to define the ''spectral window'' of the equilibrium point, (&amp;minus;α,&amp;nbsp;β).

==Explanation==
The matrix ''P'' is a projection onto the stable subspace and ''I''&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;''P'' is a projection onto the unstable subspace.  What the exponential dichotomy says is that the norm of the projection onto the stable subspace of any orbit in the system [[exponential decay|decays exponentially]] as ''t''&amp;nbsp;→&amp;nbsp;∞ and the norm of the projection onto the unstable subspace of any orbit decays exponentially as ''t''&amp;nbsp;→&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;∞, and furthermore that the stable and unstable subspaces are conjugate (because &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle P \oplus (I - P) = \mathbb{R}^n&lt;/math&gt;).

An equilibrium point with an exponential dichotomy has many of the properties of a hyperbolic equilibrium point in [[autonomous system (mathematics)|autonomous system]]s.  In fact, it can be shown that a hyperbolic point has an exponential dichotomy.

'''Female perversion''' is a term coined by [[Estela V. Welldon]] in 1992 to refer to women who commit violence, either against themselves or against others.&lt;ref name=Welldon&gt;Welldon, E.V. 1991 ''Psychology and psychopathology in women - a psychoanalytic perspective'', '''[[British Journal of Psychiatry]]''' 158 pg 85-92&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Madonna&gt;[[Estela V. Welldon|Welldon, E.V.]] 1992 ''Mother, Madonna, Whore: The Idealization and Denigration of Motherhood'' [[Free Association Books]], 1988&lt;/ref&gt;

Though the term can be used [[pejorative]]ly and sometimes has sexual connotations, its strict definition is an instance of [[human behavior]] that deviates from what is considered [[Orthodoxy|orthodox]] or [[normality (behavior)|normal]], and it is in this sense that the term is used by psychologists. The term is also controversial as according to Welldon there is a prevailing denial of the existence of female violence, throughout the legal and mental health community.&lt;ref&gt;Motz, Anna 2001 ''The psychology of female violence: crimes against the body {{ISBN|978-0415126755}}'' pg 3&lt;/ref&gt;

Welldon (1992)&lt;ref name="Madonna" /&gt; put forward a model of female perversion that introduced the term into the psychological nomenclature. The model covers several categories of violent behavior that can be directed at one's own body, against children, or against adults.

Freudian psychoanalytic theory suggested that perversion fell solely within the male domain, that it was related to the [[phallus]], and that aggressive drive was unique to men. In her book ''Madonna, Whore: The Idealisation and Denigration of Motherhood'',&lt;!-- ISBN needed --&gt; Welldon challenges this notion, and argues that women are equally capable of perversion. Though they do not use the [[penis]] with violence, they instead use the whole body.

&lt;blockquote&gt;
"In doing so, they attack the whole body, and sometimes by extension the bodies of children. They are symbolically wreaking revenge on their own internalised, often cruel and perverse mother. They identify their own body with the body of the mother. Likewise when they attack their children, they express violence towards a [[narcissistic]] extension of themselves" (Motz, 2001)&lt;ref&gt;Motz, Anna 2001 ''The psychology of female violence: crimes against the body'' pg 16&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The major forms it can manifest itself are &lt;ref&gt;Motz, Anna 2001 ''The psychology of female violence: crimes against the body'' pg 5-8&lt;/ref&gt;

* [[self-harm]]
* [[eating disorders]]
* physical and sexual abuse of children
* [[infanticide]]
* [[Munchausen syndrome by proxy]]
* physical or sexual assault of others, including battered women who kill
 
Welldon argues that it can be seen as a form of sexualised aggression, and challenges the Freudian view that violence is a uniquely male phallic expression.

&lt;blockquote&gt;
The reproductive functions and organs are used by both sexes to express perversion. Perverse men use their penises to attack and show hatred towards symbolic sources of humiliation..... If perversion in the man is focused through his penis, in the woman it will similarly expressed through her reproductive organs and the maternal representations of motherhood

(Welldon 1991) &lt;ref name="Welldon" /&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[Anna Motz]], in her book ''The psychology of female violence'' suggests that the expression of this anger on the body or that of another is a communicative act, clearly sending a message of internal pain or of psychosis (Motz, 2001).&lt;ref&gt;Motz, Anna 2001 ''The psychology of female violence: crimes against the body'' pg 6&lt;/ref&gt; She calls the message "the language of the body", and that the symbolic use of violence against the body can be likened to psychosomatic illness.

===Violence against the self===

Violence against the self can take several forms, including deprivation and starvation as is the case in [[anorexia nervosa]] and [[bulimia]], [[self-injury]] or suicide attempts, or other forms of self-harm.

===Violence against children===

Violence against children often goes unreported, and is largely hidden from view. It can take the form of direct physical or sexual assault, [[Munchausen Syndrome by Proxy]], or [[infanticide]]. Often the capacity of women to commit violence against children is denied, in the refusal to 'think the unthinkable'.&lt;ref&gt;Motz, Anna 2001 ''The psychology of female violence: crimes against the body'' pg 9&lt;/ref&gt;

===Violence against adults===
Violence against others can take many forms, from domestic assault, physical assault, and when it escalates in the form of [[homicide]] and/or [[infanticide]].

In [[Confucianism|Confucian philosophy]], '''filial piety''' ({{zh|c=孝}}, ''xiào'') is a virtue of respect for one's parents, elders, and ancestors. The Confucian ''[[Classic of Filial Piety]]'', thought to be written around the Qin-Han period, has historically been the authoritative source on the Confucian tenet of filial piety. The book, a purported dialogue between [[Confucius]] and his student [[Zengzi]], is about how to set up a good society using the principle of filial piety. The term can also be applied to general [[obedience (human behavior)|obedience]]. Filial piety is central to Confucian [[role ethics]].&lt;ref name="Chang"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Wonsuk Chang|author2=Leah Kalmanson|title=Confucianism in Context: Classic Philosophy and Contemporary Issues, East Asia and Beyond|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_UC1mvUKaU8C&amp;pg=PA68|date=8 November 2010|publisher=SUNY Press|isbn=978-1-4384-3191-8|page=68}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In more general terms, filial [[piety]] means to be good to one's parents; to take care of one's parents; to engage in good conduct not just towards parents but also outside the home so as to bring a good name to one's parents and ancestors; to perform the duties of one's job well so as to obtain the material means to support parents as well as carry out sacrifices to the ancestors; not be rebellious; show love, respect and support; display courtesy; ensure male heirs, uphold fraternity among brothers; wisely advise one's parents, including dissuading them from moral unrighteousness; display sorrow for their sickness and death; and carry out [[sacrifice]]s after their death.

Filial piety is considered a key virtue in [[Chinese culture]], and it is the main concern of a large number of stories. One of the most famous collections of such stories is ''[[The Twenty-four Filial Exemplars]]'' (''Ershi-si xiao'' [[:zh:二十四孝|二十四孝]]).  These stories depict how children exercised their filial piety in the past. While China has always had a diversity of religious beliefs, filial piety has been common to almost all of them; historian Hugh D.R. Baker calls respect for the family the only element common to almost all Chinese people.&lt;ref&gt;Baker, Hugh D. R. ''Chinese Family and Kinship.'' New York: Columbia University Press, 1979.  pg. 98&lt;/ref&gt;

==Terminology==
Filial piety is illustrated by the [[Chinese character]] ''xiao'' (孝).&lt;ref name=ikels2&gt;{{cite book|last=Ikels|first=Charlotte|title=Filial piety: Practice and discourse in contemporary East Asia|year=2004|publisher=Stanford University Press|location=Stanford|isbn=978-0-8047-4791-2|pages=2–3}}&lt;/ref&gt; The character is a combination of the character ''lao'' (old) above the character ''zi'' (son), that is, an elder being carried by a son.&lt;ref name=ikels2/&gt; In [[Korean Confucianism]], the character {{linktext|孝}} is pronounced ''hyo'' (효). In Vietnamese, the character {{linktext|孝}} is written in [[Vietnamese alphabet|Quoc Ngu]] as ''hiếu''.  In Japanese, the term is generally used in spoken and written language as 親孝行, "''oyakōkō''," adding characters for ''parent'' and ''conduct'' to make the word more specific.

According to the ''[[Classic of Filial Piety]]'', Confucius once said: "In serving his parents, a filial son reveres them in daily life; he makes them happy while he nourishes them; he takes anxious care of them in sickness; he shows great sorrow over their death that was for him; and he sacrifices to them with solemnity."&lt;ref name=ikels2/&gt; For Confucius, filial piety was not merely blind loyalty to one's parents. More important than the norms of ''xiào'' were the norms of ''rén'' (仁; [[Ren (Confucianism)|benevolence]]) and ''yì'' (義; [[Yi (Confucianism)|righteousness]]). For Confucius and [[Mencius]], ''xiào'' was a display of ''rén'' which was ideally applied in one's dealings with all elders, thus making it a general norm of intergenerational relations. However, in practice, ''xiào'' was usually reserved for one's own parents and grandparents, and from time to time, was elevated above the notions of ''rén'' and ''yì''.{{Citation needed|date=August 2018}}

Filial piety was emphasized in Confucianism because devotion to one's parents was often associated with one's devotion to the state.&lt;ref&gt;See Analects 1:2, Xiao Jing chap.1&lt;/ref&gt;

===Buddhism===
Buddhism stressed ''individual'' salvation, and had little room for the interdependent society that Confucianism had created in China, which stressed the good of the ''community'' more than the good of the ''individual''. In India, Buddhism also advocated [[celibacy]] among its monks which was unacceptable in the Confucian world view, given that it was viewed as the child's duty to continue the parental line.&lt;ref&gt;Traylor, Kenneth L. ''Chinese Filial Piety.'' Bloomington: Eastern Press, 1988. pg. 110&lt;/ref&gt;

====Introduction of Buddhism in China====
When Buddhism was introduced to China, it was redefined to support filial piety. The ''[[Mouzi Lihuolun]]'' (牟子理惑論), a work defending Buddhism to the Chinese, presented arguments for Buddhist monks' seemingly poor treatment of their parents, by closely reading the works of Confucius himself. The ''[[Guiyangtu]]'' (跪羊图)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=跪羊图高清大字版|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E_xo5KwtW1M|website=Youtube|accessdate=25 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Vimalakirti]] Nirdesa Sutra&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Robert|first1=Thurman|title=Vimalakirti Nirdesa Sutra|url=http://www2.kenyon.edu/Depts/Religion/Fac/Adler/Reln260/Vimalakirti.htm|accessdate=25 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; are also Buddhist works portraying lay householder duties and obligations in contrast with pure monastic renunciation.

=====Mouzi Lihuolun=====
The ''[[Mouzi Lihuolun]]'' compares the Buddhist monk to a filial son who saves his father from drowning.
&lt;blockquote&gt;A long time ago, the Ch'i people crossed a large river in a boat and it happened that their father fell into the water. His sons rolled up their sleeves, seized his head, and turned him upside down, forcing the water out of his mouth, thus bringing their father back to life. Now, to seize one's father's head and turn him upside down is certainly not very filial. Yet they could have done nothing better to save their father's life. If they had folded their hands and practiced the norm of filial sons, their father's life would have been lost in the waters.&lt;ref&gt;Keenan, John P. (1994). ''How master Mou removes our doubts: a reader-response study and translation of the'' Mou-tzu Li-huo lun'', SUNY Press, p. 83.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
The behavior of a Buddhist monk is similar.  While on the surface the Buddhist seems to reject and abandon his parents, the pious Buddhist is actually aiding his parents as well as himself on their path towards salvation. The ''Mouzi Lihuolun'' also attempted to counter charges that not having children was a violation of good ethics. It was pointed out that Confucius himself had praised a number of [[asceticism|ascetic]] sages who had not had children or family, but because of their wisdom and sacrifice were still perceived as ethical by Confucius.  The argument that Buddhist filial piety concerns itself with the parent’s soul is the most important one. The same essential argument was made later by [[Sun Chuo]], who argued that Buddhists monks (far from working solely for their own benefit) were working to ensure the salvation of all people and aiding their family by doing so.&lt;ref&gt;Zurcher, E.  ''The Buddhist Conquest of China.'' Leiden: E. J. Brill., 1959a, pg. 134&lt;/ref&gt; [[Huiyuan (Buddhist)|Huiyuan]] continued in this reasoning, arguing that if one member leaves the household to be a monk, then all other members of the family would benefit from good fortune and lead superior lives.

=====Adaptation =====
These philosophical arguments were not entirely successful in convincing the filial Chinese that the behavior advocated by Buddhism was correct, and so less subtle methods were employed.  To more directly give Buddhism filial nature, passages and parables that were of minor importance in Indian and Central Asian Buddhism became very prominent in Chinese Buddhism. ''The story of Shanzi'' 睒子 ("Syama" in [[Sanskrit]], Sama in [[Pali|Pāli]], from the "[[Jataka tales|Sama Jātaka]]"), is an example of this.

=====''Story of Shanzi''=====
Shanzi spent his entire life aiding his blind parents, until he was accidentally killed.  But, because of his life of filial devotion, he was miraculously revived.  This story was often mentioned in the [[Chinese Buddhist canon|Chinese canon]] of Buddhist texts, and was included in a number of different anthologies (such as the ''Liudu Jijing'' and referred to by other [[Chinese Buddhist]] writers.&lt;ref&gt;Ch'en, Kenneth. ''The Chinese Transformation of Buddhism.'' Princeton: Princeton University Press, 1973. pg. 23&lt;/ref&gt; While it is clearly of [[Buddhism in India|Indian]] origin based on the story of [[Shravan]], this tale was virtually indistinguishable from similar Chinese tales. While the tale was transmitted along with Buddhist writings, philosophically it had very little to do with traditional Buddhism.{{Citation needed|date=August 2018}}

=====The story of Moggallāna=====
{{Main|Mulian Rescues His Mother}}
Another story advocating filial piety is that of [[Moggallana|Moggallāna]], a Buddhist monk who goes to great lengths to rescue his mother from condemnation for her unjust life. This story appeared in the ''[[Ullambana Sutra|Ullambana Sūtra]]'' and it is far more relevant to Buddhism than the tale of Shan-tzǔ, though it was still not a particularly important tale in Indian Buddhism. In China, however, these stories became not just elements of Buddhist scripture, but also popular tales which were even told among non-Buddhists. While these tales were a part of the Buddhist tradition, East Asian Buddhism raised them from a peripheral role to a central one.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Berezkin|first1=Rostislav|title=Pictorial Versions of the Mulian Story in East Asia (Tenth–Seventeenth Centuries): On the Connections of Religious Painting and Storytelling|journal=Fudan Journal of the Humanities and Social Sciences|date=21 February 2015|volume=8|issue=1|doi=10.1007/s40647-015-0060-4 |others=Chapter 7}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |editor-last1=Williams|editor-first1=Paul|editor-last2=Ladwig|editor-first2=Patrice|editorlink1=Paul Williams (philosopher)|author-last1=Ladwig|author-first1=Patrice|encyclopedia=Buddhist funeral cultures of Southeast Asia and China|title=Feeding the dead: ghosts, materiality and merit|date=2012|publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]]|location=Cambridge|isbn=1-107-00388-1|url=https://books.google.com/?id=3zdJ1kHIkxEC |p=137}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=====Other texts=====
Another tale that achieved great renown in China was that of the Buddha rising to heaven for three months after his [[Bodhi|enlightenment]] to preach and teach his mother his new philosophy.  This tale was used to indicate that the Buddha did indeed show proper concern and respect for his parents, in that he cared for their immortal souls.

A number of [[Apocryphal Buddhist sutra|apocryphal texts]] were also written that spoke of the Buddha's respect for his parents, and the parent-child relationship.  The most important of these, the ''[[Sutra of Filial Piety]]'', was written early in the [[Tang dynasty]]. This [[Sutra|text (''sūtra'')]] has the Buddha making the very Confucian argument that parents made great sacrifices, and put great efforts into ensuring the well-being of their child.  In return each child must repay this kindness with loyalty and respect.  Despite being a forgery, the ''sūtra'' was accepted as accurate by generations of scholars and commoners, and it played an important role in the development of a [[Chinese Buddhism|fully Chinese variation of Buddhism]]. Other documents discussing the Buddha’s views on the parent child-relationship were also probably forgeries.  The ''[[Sutra on a Filial Son]]'', for instance, also sounds far more Chinese than Indian, and shows Confucian influence.{{Citation needed|date=August 2018}}

=== Criticism ===
Lu Xun in his collection "Dawn Blossoms Plucked at Dusk" (朝花夕拾) criticized the stories "He Buried His Son for His Mother" and "Wang Xiang: He Lay on Ice in Search of Carp". The latter story is about Wang Xiang, a very young boy, who laid on an iced lake in order to get a fish for his sick mother.{{Citation needed|date=August 2018}}

'''''Friendly Fascism: The New Face of Power in America''''' is a [[book]] written by American [[social scientist]] and professor of [[political science]] at [[Hunter College]] [[Bertram Myron Gross|Bertram Gross]] and published on June 1, 1980 by M. Evans &amp; Company as a 419-page hardback book containing 440 quotations and sources. The book examines the history of [[fascism]] and based on the growth of [[big business]] and [[big government]] describes [[Scenario planning|possible political scenarios]] for a [[Futures studies|future United States]].&lt;ref name="NYBOOKS-19801023"/&gt;&lt;ref name="AJLS-1980"/&gt;&lt;ref name="EM-DWharton"/&gt; According to a 1981 review in the journal [[Social Justice (journal)|''Social Justice'']], the book is described as "timely" on a subject requiring serious consideration and is about the dangers of fascism, focusing primarily on the United States, but being aware that [[monopoly capitalism]] needs to be understood internationally since [[capitalism]] "is not a national [[mode of production]]".&lt;ref name="SJ-1981"/&gt;

In 2016, the book prompted the following response right after [[Donald Trump]] was elected [[President of the United States]]: "The next wave of fascists will not come with [[Stock car (rail)|cattle cars]] and [[Internment|concentration camps]], but they'll come with a [[Smiley|smiley face]] and maybe a [[Television show|TV show]]. [...] That’s how the 21st-century fascists will essentially take over".&lt;ref name="HP-20161114" /&gt;

== Reactions ==
According to [[Jason Epstein]], editor, publisher and book reviewer for ''[[The New York Review of Books]]'', "''Friendly Fascism'' [...] reflects what seems to be a widespread feeling among [[Liberalism in the United States|liberals]] as well as [[Conservatism in the United States|conservatives]] that [[democracy]] in America has played itself out: that soon Americans won’t be able to govern themselves".&lt;ref name="NYBOOKS-19801023"&gt;{{cite news |last=Epstein |first=Jason |authorlink=Jason Epstein |title=Is the Party Over? |url=https://www.nybooks.com/articles/1980/10/23/is-the-party-over/ |date=October 23, 1980 |work=[[The New York Review of Books]] |accessdate=September 19, 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[Gaddis Smith]], professor emeritus of history at [[Yale University]] and an expert on American [[International relations|foreign relations]], the book is an "insightful lament over the growth of centralized power by business and government in alliance under the direction of faceless managers who [...] are replacing democracy with a form of benevolent fascism".&lt;ref name="FA-19800901"&gt;{{cite web |last=Smith |first=Gaddis |authorlink=Gaddis Smith |title=Friendly Fascism: The New Face of Power in America (capsule review) |url=https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/1980-09-01/friendly-fascism-new-face-power-america |date=September 1, 1980 |work=[[Foreign Affairs]] |accessdate=September 19, 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Writing on behalf of ''[[Eclectica Magazine]]'', reviewer Dale Wharton comments that the book offers "faint hope of averting [[neofascism]]", but as a possible offset suggests raising aspirations, notably by "setting forth clear lofty goals, broad enough to embrace a great majority".

Reviewer Dennis Phillips notes in the ''Australian Journal of Law &amp; Society'' that Gross wrote ''Friendly Fascism'' before [[Ronald Reagan]] had become [[President of the United States]], but Reagan's United States, presumed in part to be a result of neofascist techniques described in the book, had "proven Bertram Gross to be an amazingly astute prophet .

More recently in 2016, the book prompted the following response from [[Michael Moore]] right after [[Donald Trump]] was elected President: "The next wave of fascists will not come with [[Stock car (rail)|cattle cars]] and [[Internment|concentration camps]], but they'll come with a [[Smiley|smiley face]] and maybe a [[Television show|TV show]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="15037">The '''generation effect''' is a phenomenon where information is better [[memory|remembered]] if it is generated from one's own mind rather than simply [[reading (process)|read]].&lt;ref name="jacoby"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Jacoby |first= L.L. |year=1978 |title=On interpreting the effects of repetition: Solving a problem versus remembering a solution |journal=Journal of Verbal Learning and Verbal Behavior |volume=17 |issue=6 |pages=649–668 |doi= 10.1016/S0022-5371(78)90393-6 |url=http://psych.wustl.edu/amcclab/Manuscripts/Jacoby/Jacoby%20(1978)/Retention%20Effects%20of%20Solving%20vs.%20Remembering.PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt; Researchers have struggled to account for why generated information is better recalled than read information, but no single explanation has been sufficient.

==In experiments==
The generation effect is typically achieved in [[cognitive psychology]] experiments by asking participants to generate words from word fragments.&lt;ref name=crutcher&gt;{{cite journal |last=Crutcher |first=R.J. |author2=Healy, A.F. |year=1989 |title=Cognitive operations and the generation effect |journal=Journal of Experimental Psychology: Learning, Memory, and Cognition |volume=15 |issue=4 |pages=669–675  |doi=10.1037/0278-7393.15.4.669}}&lt;/ref&gt; This effect has also been demonstrated using a variety of other materials, such as when generating a word after being presented with its [[antonym]]&lt;ref name="mulligan" /&gt; or [[synonym]],&lt;ref name="jacoby"/&gt; generating keywords in paragraphs,&lt;ref name="dewinstanley"&gt;{{cite journal |last=deWinstanley |first=P.A. |author2=Bjork, E.L. |year=2004 |title=Processing strategies and the generation effect: Implications for making a better reader |journal=Memory &amp; Cognition |volume=32 |issue=6 |pages=945–955|doi=10.3758/BF03196872}}&lt;/ref&gt; pictures,&lt;ref name=kinjo&gt;{{cite journal |last=Kinjo |first= H. |author2=Snodgrass, J.G. |year=2000 |title=Does the generation effect occur for pictures? |journal=The American Journal of Psychology |volume=113 |issue=1 |pages=95–121 |doi=10.2307/1423462|pmid=10742845 |jstor=1423462}}&lt;/ref&gt; and arithmetic problems.&lt;ref name="crutcher"/&gt;&lt;ref name="mcnamara"&gt;{{cite journal |last=McNamara |first=D.S. |author2=Healy, A.F. |year=2000 |title=A procedural explanation of the generation effect for simple and difficult multiplication problems and answers |journal=Journal of Memory and Language |volume=43 |issue=4 |pages=652–679  |doi=10.1006/jmla.2000.2720 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, the generation effect has been found in studies using [[free recall]], [[cued recall]], and recognition tests.&lt;ref name="mulligan"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Mulligan |first=N.W. |year=2001 |title=Generation and hypermnesia |journal=Journal of Experimental Psychology: Learning, Memory, and Cognition |volume=27 |issue=2 |pages=436–450|doi=10.1037/0278-7393.27.2.436}}&lt;/ref&gt; In one study, the subject was provided with a stimulus word, the first letter of the response, and a word relating the two. For example, with the rule of opposite, the stimulus word "hot", and the letter "c", the word cold would be generated. This methodology has since been used in the majority of experiments investigating the generation effect.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite techreport|last=McNamara|first=Danielle|title=The Generation Effect: A Detailed Analysis of the Role of Semantic Processing|url=http://ics.colorado.edu/techpubs/pdf/92-02.pdf|publisher=Institute of Cognitive Science, University of Colorado|id=92-02|date=1992|citeseerx=10.1.1.20.3266|deadurl=bot: unknown|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070818140359/http://ics.colorado.edu/techpubs/pdf/92-02.pdf|archivedate=2007-08-18|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Causes==

===Lexical activation hypothesis===
According to the lexical activation hypothesis, the participant must search his or her [[semantic memory]] during the process of generation. The search activates [[semantic]] features in memory that are related to the target item. During the retrieval of the target item at testing, the semantic features serve as retrieval cues and aid in the recall of the target item.&lt;ref name="crutcher"/&gt; One study done by Payne, Neely, and Burns further tested this hypothesis. Their research question was: will the generation effect occur for words only or also [[non-word]]s? To test this they studied 168 Purdue undergraduate students. The researchers divided the participants up into two groups. The first group had word or non word pairs that rhymed and were told to read both out loud. The second group had a word or non word and the first letter of the next followed by blanks, and were told to read the first word out loud and generate a word that rhymed with the first word and started with the letter presented. The results were as expected. Participants were only generating words rather than non words according to the lexical activation hypothesis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Payne|first=David |author2=James Neely |author3=Daniel Burns|title=The Generation Effect: Further Tests of the Lexical Activation Hypothesis|journal=Memory &amp; Cognition|date= 1986|volume=14|issue=3 |pages=246–252|doi=10.3758/BF03197700}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Procedural account===
The procedural account, which builds upon the lexical activation hypothesis, argues that people are more likely to engage in particular [[cognitive]] procedures during the encoding of items when generating than when reading. The process of generation induces people to connect the item to information in memory (unlike the lexical activation hypothesis, the information in memory does not necessarily reside in the [[lexicon]]). The generation effect occurs if the procedures used during encoding are reinstated during the memory test.&lt;ref name="mcnamara"/&gt; Procedural account is also linked to transfer-appropriate processing in that they both cause or do not cause the generation effect depending on encoding and retrieval processes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=DeWinstanley|first=Patricia|author2=Elizabeth Bjork|title=Processing Strategies and the Generation Effect: Implications for Making a Better Reader|journal=Memory &amp; Cognition|year=2004|volume=32|issue=6|pages=945–955|doi=10.3758/BF03196872}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Multifactor transfer-appropriate processing account===
According to the multifactor transfer-appropriate processing account, the generation task forces participants to focus their processing on the type of information needed to solve the generation task. When a later test is sensitive to the same type of information, a generation effect occurs. However, when there is not a match between the type of information processed to solve the generation task and the type of information needed to do well on a later test, the generation effect does not occur.&lt;ref name="deWinstanley2"&gt;{{cite journal |last=deWinstanley |first=P.A. |author2=Bjork, E.L. |author3=Bjork, R.A. |year=1996 |title =Generation effects and the lack thereof: The role of transfer-appropriate processing |journal=Memory |volume=4 |issue=1 |pages=31–48  |doi=10.1080/741940667 |pmid=8821084}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, a participant that is required to generate same-category targets from distinctive semantic cues (e.g., PURR-C_T, SADDLE-H_RS_) is likely to notice similarities between the targets (e.g., they are all animals). This type of manipulation would promote whole-list relational processing, which may enhance generation performance on a free recall test. Other manipulations can emphasise cue-target processing, thus helping generation performance on cued recall tests.&lt;ref name="mcdaniel"&gt;{{cite journal |year=1988 |title=A contextual account of the generation effect: A three-factor theory |journal=Journal of Memory and Language |volume=27 |pages=521–536 |doi=10.1016/0749-596X(88)90023-X |issue=5|last1=McDaniel |first1=Mark A |last2=Waddill |first2=Paula J |last3=Einstein |first3=Gilles O }}&lt;/ref&gt;

It has been found that the generation effect was invariable across the different types of memory encoding.
&lt;ref name=mcnamara /&gt;

==Limitations==
By manipulating materials or instructions, experimenters have reduced or eliminated the generation effect. This suggests that there are instances in which [[reading (process)|reading]] can have the same memorial gains as generating. For example, when participants are given instructions to process information in a manner that was similar to the processing performed by the participants in the generate condition, the generation advantage between the groups was eliminated.&lt;ref name="mcdaniel"/&gt; In another study, participants who used a processing strategy (imagery) that was more effective than reading performed just as well as those who generated.&lt;ref name="begg"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Begg |first=I. |author2=Vinski, E. |author3=Frankovich, L. |author4=Holgate, B.  |year=1991 |title=Generating makes words memorable, but so does effective reading |journal=Memory &amp; Cognition |volume=19 |issue=5 |pages=487–497 |doi=10.3758/BF03199571}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although the generation effect is a robust finding, there are some studies that have found no memorial benefits of generating compared to reading. For example, one study did not find the generation effect when they used legal non-words and found a reduced generation effect when they used material unfamiliar to the participants. They concluded that generating may have limited effectiveness when applied to new or unfamiliar material. This warrants some concern because if the generation effect is to be incorporated into educational practices such as classroom teaching, we would want it to help students learn new material.&lt;ref name= "lutz"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Lutz |first=John |author2=Briggs, A. |author3=Cain, K. |year=2003 |title=An examination of the value of the generation effect for learning new material |journal=The Journal of General Psychology |volume=130 |issue=2 |pages=171–188 |doi=10.1080/00221300309601283 |pmid=12773019}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is possible that the generation effect may cause a trade-off in encoding item information and associative information.&lt;ref name="mulligan2"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Mulligan |first=Neil W. |year=2004 |title=Generation and memory for contextual detail |journal=Journal of Experimental Psychology: Learning, Memory, and Cognition |volume=30 |issue=4 |pages=838–855 |doi=10.1037/0278-7393.30.4.838 |pmid=15238028}}&lt;/ref&gt; The processing of item-specific features of the target item may be enhanced when generating, and generating may also enhance the processing of cue-target relation. But, encoding requires limited-capacity resources, so the better encoding of one type of information may occur at a cost to the encoding of other information.&lt;ref name=mulligan2/&gt;&lt;ref name="jurica"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Jurica |first=P.J. |author2=Shimamura, A.P. |year=1999 |title=Monitoring item and source information: Evidence for a negative generation effect in source memory |journal=Memory &amp; Cognition |volume=27 |issue=4 |pages=648–656 |doi=10.3758/BF03211558}}&lt;/ref&gt; This also has implications for applying generation to educational practices because even if generation improves the recall of specific words, the memory for the contextual information surrounding those words may suffer.

==Practical applications==
{{tone|section|date=June 2016}}
The generation effect appears promising as a strategy for learning, and particularly for remembering educational material. Currently, researchers at [[UCLA]] and [[UC Berkeley]] are investigating ways to incorporate learning strategies such as the generation effect, as well as other "desirable difficulties", into the classroom.&lt;ref&gt;http://iddeas.psych.ucla.edu&lt;/ref&gt;

There are some ways that you could use generation to aid in [[memory retention]]. Here are some examples:
* Read a section of your book. Then, close the book and generate (and answer) questions about what you just read.
* If there are review questions at the end of a chapter, answer those questions without looking back at the pages.
* Use [[flashcards]] to test yourself.
* If you are an educator (or if you want to write a practice test for a friend), create tests that require fill-in-the-blank, short answer, or essay responses rather than [[multiple-choice]] responses.

==Exceptions==

There are several reports in the literature that suggest that individuals diagnosed with DAT (which stands for dementia of the Alzheimer type) do not show the generation effect. One study included 42 healthy adults, 23 with very mild DAT, and 26 with mild DAT. Researchers Kristi S. Multhaup and David A. Balota had participants  read  some  sentences  (e.g.,  "The  horse  jumped  the fence") and  generate  the  endings  to  other sentences  (e.g., "The  gentleman  opened  the  ").  Later, participants were  given the  subjects of the sentences  (e.g.,  "horse"; "gentleman")  and  asked to recall  the  object  that  had  been paired  with the  words in  the previous  sentences  (e.g., "fence";  "door").  Healthy older adults  showed  higher recall  for  words  that they  had  generated  compared  with 383 words  that  they  had  read  (i.e.,  a  significant  generation effect). In contrast, individuals diagnosed with DAT did not show a difference in recall for words that they had generated and words that they had read. Similarly, another study reported four experiments with the  same  group  of  18  DAT  individuals  and  found  little evidence  for  a  generation  effect  in  word  recall,  word recognition, or recall of action instructions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.artsci.wustl.edu/~dbalota/Generation%20effects%20and%20source%20memory%20Multhuap%20Balota.pdf|doi=10.1037/0894-4105.11.3.382|pmid=9223142|title=Generation effects and source memory in healthy older adults and in adults with dementia of the Alzheimer type|journal=Neuropsychology|volume=11|issue=3|pages=382–391|year=1997|last1=Multhaup|first1=Kristi S.|last2=Balota|first2=David A.|deadurl=bot: unknown|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100614100324/http://www.artsci.wustl.edu/~dbalota/Generation%20effects%20and%20source%20memory%20Multhuap%20Balota.pdf|archivedate=2010-06-14|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Nonhuman animals==

There is some evidence that animals also display the generation effect during learning.&lt;ref name="kornell"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Kornell |first=N. |author2=Terrace, H.S. |year=2007 |title=The Generation Effect in monkeys |journal=Psychological Science |volume=18 |issue=8 |pages=682–685 |doi=10.1111/j.1467-9280.2007.01959.x|pmid=17680937 }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, more recent work challenges the idea animals display the generation effect.&lt;ref name="staniland"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Staniland |first=J. |author2=Colombo, M. |author3=Scarf, D.|year=2015 |title=The Generation Effect or Simply Generating an Effect? |journal=Journal of Comparative Psychology |volume=129 |issue=4 |pages=329–333 |doi=10.1037/a0039450|pmid=26147702 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Giving What We Can''' ('''GWWC''') is an [[effective altruism]] associated organization whose members pledge to give 10% of their income to effective charities. It was founded at [[Oxford University]] in 2009 by the ethics researcher [[Toby Ord]].

== Research ==
{{see also|Charity evaluator}}

Giving What We Can conducts research to determine which charities it recommends for members and other people to support. It differs from other charity evaluators in terms of the importance given to metrics of charity performance. While evaluators such as [[Charity Navigator]] use the fraction of donations spent on program expenses versus administrative overhead as an important indicator, Giving What We Can solely focuses on the cost-effectiveness of the charity's work.&lt;ref name="rosenberg nyt" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Ethical Consumer"&gt;{{cite web|title=Charities in the ethical spotlight|url=http://www.ethicalconsumer.org/commentanalysis/factsvgreenwash/charitiesandtheirsocialandenvironmentalperformance.aspx|website=www.ethicalconsumer.org|publisher=Ethical Consumer|accessdate=18 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; It believes that the variance in cost-effectiveness of charities arises largely due to the variance in the nature of the causes that the charities operate in, and therefore makes evaluations across broad areas of work such as health, education, and emergency aid before comparing specific organizations.&lt;ref name="gwwc-methodology"&gt;{{cite web|title=How We Assess Charities|url=https://www.givingwhatwecan.org/about-us/how-we-assess-charities|website=Giving What We Can|accessdate=18 March 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; In practice, it recommends a selected few charities in the area of [[global health]]. Its work is therefore similar to that of [[GiveWell]].&lt;ref name="Mathieson" /&gt;

[[File:Hamilton-burr-duel.jpg|thumb|Alexander Hamilton [[Burr–Hamilton duel|defends his honour]] by accepting Aaron Burr's challenge.]]

'''Honour''' (or '''honor''' in [[American English]]; either spelling in [[Canadian English]])&lt;ref&gt; The ''Gage Canadian Dictionary'' (1997) (p. vii) states: "Canadian usage is almost equally divided between -our and -or spellings in words such as colour/color and honour/honor, so both spellings are accepted by this Canadian dictionary as standard Canadian spelling."&lt;/ref&gt; is the idea of a bond between an individual and a society as a quality of a person that is both of social teaching and of personal [[ethos]], that manifests itself as a [[code of conduct]], and has various elements such as valor, chivalry, honesty, and compassion. It is an abstract concept entailing a perceived quality of worthiness and respectability that affects both the social standing and the self-evaluation of an individual or institution such as a family, school, regiment or nation. Accordingly, individuals (or institutions) are assigned worth and stature based on the harmony of their actions with a specific [[honour code|code of honour]], and the moral code of the society at large.

[[Samuel Johnson]], in his ''[[A Dictionary of the English Language]]'' (1755), defined honour as having several senses, the first of which was "[[nobility]] of soul, [[magnanimity]], and a scorn of [[meanness]]".
This sort of honour derives from the perceived virtuous conduct and personal integrity of the person endowed with it.  On the other hand, Johnson also defined honour in relationship to "reputation" and "fame"; to "privileges of rank or birth", and as "respect" of the kind which "places an individual socially and determines his right to precedence". This sort of honour is often not so much a function of moral or ethical excellence, as it is a consequence of power. Finally, with respect to sexuality, ''honour'' has traditionally been associated with (or identical to) "chastity" or "virginity", or in case of married men and women, "fidelity". Some have argued that honour should be seen more as a rhetoric, or set of possible actions, than as a code.

== Social context ==
[[File:Wall of Honour, Royal Military College of Canada.jpg|thumb|right|Wall of Honour, [[Royal Military College of Canada]]]]

Honour as a code of behaviour defines the duties of an individual within a social group.  Margaret Visser observes that in an honour-based society "a person is what he or she is in the eyes of other people".&lt;ref name=Visser&gt;
{{cite news | first = Jim | last = Doris | title = A conversation with Margaret Visser: diagnosing that feeling of helplessness | date = 2003-01-05 | url = http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m0MKY/is_1_27/ai_111696819/ | work = [[Catholic New Times]] | accessdate = 2011-03-10}}
&lt;/ref&gt; A '''code of honour''' differs from a legal code, also socially defined and concerned with justice, in that honour remains implicit rather than explicit and objectified.

One can distinguish honour from [[dignity]], which Wordsworth assessed as measured against an individual's conscience&lt;ref&gt;
"...dignity abides with him alone / Who, in the silent hour of inward thought, / Can still suspect, and still revere himself...." [[William Wordsworth]], "Yew Tree" http://www.bartleby.com/145/ww119.html.
&lt;/ref&gt; rather than against the judgement of a community. Compare also the sociological concept of [[Face (sociological concept)|"face"]].

In the early medieval period, a lord's or lady's honour was the group of manors or lands he or she held. "The word was first used indicating an estate which gave its holder dignity and status."&lt;ref&gt;''A Dictionary of Medieval Terms and Phrases,'' Christopher Corédon, 2004, D.S. Brewer, Cambridge, {{ISBN|1-84384-023-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;  For a person to say "on my honour" was not just an affirmation of his or her [[integrity]] and rank, but the veracity behind that phrase meant he or she was willing to offer up estates as pledge and guarantee.

The concept of honour appears to have declined in importance in the modern [[Western world|West]];  [[conscience]] has replaced it&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite book|last= Ignatieff|first= Michael|title= The Warrior's Honour: Ethnic War and the Modern Conscience|year= 1997|publisher= Henry Holt and Co.|location= New York, New York|pages= paraphrased from whole book}}
&lt;/ref&gt; in the individual context, and the rule of law (with the rights and duties defined therein) has taken over in a social context.  Popular [[stereotype]]s would have it surviving more definitively in more tradition-bound cultures (e.g. [[Pashtuns|Pashtun]], [[Southern Italy|Southern Italian]], [[Poles|Polish]], [[Persian people|Persian]], [[Turkey|Turkish]], [[Arab]], [[Iberian peninsula|Iberian]], "[[Old South]]" or [[Dixie]]) in a perception akin to [[Orientalism]]. Feudal or other agrarian societies, which focus upon land use and land ownership, may tend to "honour" more than do contemporary industrial societies. Note that Saint [[Anselm of Canterbury]] (c. 1033 – 1109) in ''[[Cur Deus Homo]]'' extended the concept of honour from his own feudal society to postulate God's honour.&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;

An emphasis on the importance of honour exists in such traditional institutions as the [[military]] (serving officers may conduct a [[court of honour]]) and in organisations with a military ethos, such as [[Scouting]] organisations (which also feature "Courts of Honour"&lt;ref&gt;

Honour in the case of sexuality frequently relates, historically, to [[fidelity]]: preservation of "honour" equates primarily to maintenance of the [[virginity]] of singles and to the exclusive [[monogamy]] of the remainder of the population. Further conceptions of this type of honour vary widely between cultures; some cultures regard [[honour killing]]s of (mostly female) members of one's own family as justified if the individuals have "defiled the family's honour" by marrying against the family's wishes, or even by becoming the victims of [[rape]]. Western observers generally see these honour killings as a way of men using the culture of honour to control female sexuality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title = Honour killings of girls and women | date = 1999-08-31 | publisher = [[Amnesty International]] | url = https://www.amnesty.org/en/library/info/ASA33/018/1999/en | work = Amnesty International library | accessdate = 2013-12-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Skinners, [[executioner]]s, [[Gravedigger|grave-diggers]], shepherds, [[Barber surgeon|barber-surgeons]], millers, linen-weavers, sow-gelders, [[Manual scavenging|latrine-cleaners]], and bailiffs and their families were among the "dishonourable people" (''unehrliche Leute'') in early modern German society.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cambridgeindia.org/showbookdetails.asp?ISBN=9780521652391&amp;category_id=63 Defiled Trades and Social Outcasts - Honor and Ritual Pollution in Early Modern Germany] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131003064153/http://www.cambridgeindia.org/showbookdetails.asp?ISBN=9780521652391&amp;category_id=63 |date=3 October 2013 }}, Cambridge University Press, 2000&lt;/ref&gt;

== Cultures of honour and cultures of law ==

Various sociologists and anthropologists have contrasted cultures of honour with cultures of law. A culture of law has a body of laws which all members of society must obey, with punishments for transgressors. This requires a society with the structures required to enact and enforce laws. A culture of law incorporates a social contract: members of society give up some aspects of their freedom to defend themselves and retaliate for injuries, on the understanding that society will apprehend and punish transgressors.

An alternative to government enforcement of laws is community or individual enforcement of social norms.

One way that honor functions is as a major factor of [[reputation]]. In a system where there is no court that will authorize the use of force to guarantee the execution of contracts, an honorable reputation is very valuable to promote [[Trust (emotion)|trust]] among transaction partners.  To dishonor an agreement could be economically ruinous, because all future potential transaction partners might stop trusting the party not to lie, steal their money or goods, not repay debts, mistreat the children they marry off, have children with other people, abandon their children, or fail to provide aid when needed.  A dishonorable person might be shunned by the community as a way to punish bad behavior and create an incentive for others to maintain their honor.

If one's honor is questioned, it can thus be important to disprove any false accusations or [[slander]].  In some cultures, the practice of [[dueling]] has arisen as a means to settle such disputes firmly, though by physical dominance in force or skill rather than by objective consideration of evidence and facts.

Honor can also imply [[duty]] to perform certain actions, such as providing for and disciplining one's children, serving in the military during war, contributing to local collective projects like building infrastructure, or exacting [[revenge]] in retaliation for acts one is directly harmed by.

The concept of personal honor can be extended to [[family honor]], which strengthens the incentives to follow social norms in two ways. First, the consequences of dishonorable actions (such as suicide or attempted robbery that results in death) outlive the perpetrator, and negatively affect family members they presumably care about.  Second, when one member of the family misbehaves, other members of the family are in the position to and are incentivized to strongly enforce the community norms.

In strong honor cultures, those who do not conform may be forced or pressured into conformance and transgressors punished physically or psychologically. The use of violence may be collective in its character, where many relatives act together.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.hedersfortryck.se/hedersfortryck/vad-ar-hedersrelaterat-vald-och-fortryck/kollektivistiska-strukturer/|title=Kollektivistiska strukturer {{!}} Hedersförtryck.se|last=|first=|date=|work=County administrative board of Ostrogothia ([[Länsstyrelsen]] [[Östergötland]])|access-date=2017-11-15|language=sv-SE}}&lt;/ref&gt; The most extreme form of punishment is [[honor killing]].  Dueling and vengeance at a family level can result in a sustained [[feud]].

Honor-based cultures are also known as [[honor-shame culture]]s and contrasted with [[guilt society|guilt cultures]] on the [[Guilt-Shame-Fear spectrum of cultures]].

Cultures of honor are often conservative, encoding pre-modern traditional family values and duties.  In some cases these values clash with those of post-[[sexual revolution]] and [[egalitarian]] societies.  Add to this the prohibition against [[vigilante]] or individual justice-taking, [[cultures of law]] sometimes consider practices in honor cultures to be unethical or a violation of the legal concept of [[human right]]s.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.oxfordbibliographies.com/view/document/obo-9780195396607/obo-9780195396607-0160.xml|title=Honor Cultures and Violence - Criminology - Oxford Bibliographies - obo|access-date=2017-11-15|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.svt.se/nyheter/lokalt/gavleborg/polisens-utredare-utbildades-i-om-hederskulturer|title=Polisens utredare utbildades om hederskulturer|last=Nyheter|first=SVT|work=SVT Nyheter|access-date=2017-11-15|language=sv}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://edition.cnn.com/2017/04/25/middleeast/jordan-lebanon-marriage-rape-law/index.html|title=Activists demand end to marriage rape laws|last=CNN|first=Tamara Qiblawi,|work=CNN|access-date=2017-11-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Examples around the world==

Historians have especially examined the [[Culture of honor (Southern United States)|culture of honor in American South]].&lt;ref&gt;Bertram.  Wyatt-Brown, ''Southern honor: Ethics and behavior in the Old South'' (Oxford University Press, 2007)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kenneth S. Greenberg, ''Honor &amp; Slavery: Lies, Duels, Noses, Masks, Dressing as a Woman, Gifts, Strangers, Humanitarianism, Death, Slave Rebellions, the Proslavery Argument, Baseball, Hunting, and Gambling in the Old South'' (Princeton University Press, 1996)&lt;/ref&gt; Social scientists have looked at specialized subcultures such as South Asian Muslims in Britain.&lt;ref&gt;[[Pnina Werbner]], "Honor, shame and the politics of sexual embodiment among South Asian Muslims in Britain and beyond: An analysis of debates in the public sphere." ''International Social Science Review'' 6#1 (2005): 25-47.&lt;/ref&gt;  Others have compared multiple modern nations.&lt;ref&gt;Klaus Helkama, et al. "Honor as a value in Finland, Estonia, Italy, Russia, and Switzerland." ''Group Processes &amp; Intergroup Relations'' 16#3 (2013): 279-297.&lt;/ref&gt;

One paper finds that present-day Canadians born in communities that historically lay outside the reach of the [[Royal Canadian Mounted Police]] (Mounties) seem to inherit a violent code of honour that drives their behaviour.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/10/11/opinion/sunday/canadas-history-of-violence.html|title=Canada’s History of Violence|last=Restrepo|first=Pascual|date=2015-10-09|newspaper=The New York Times|issn=0362-4331|access-date=2016-05-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From the viewpoint of anthropologists, cultures of honour typically appear among [[nomad]]ic peoples and among herdsmen who carry their most valuable [[property]] with them and risk having it stolen, without having recourse to law enforcement or to [[government]]. Due to the lack of strong institutions, cultivating a reputation for swift and disproportionate [[revenge]] increases the safety of one's person and property against aggressive actors.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = The Evolutionary Basis of Honor Cultures|url = http://pss.sagepub.com/content/early/2015/11/24/0956797615602860|journal = Psychological Science|date = 2015-11-25|issn = 0956-7976|pmid = 26607976|pages = 0956797615602860|doi = 10.1177/0956797615602860|language = en|first = Andrzej|last = Nowak|first2 = Michele J.|last2 = Gelfand|first3 = Wojciech|last3 = Borkowski|first4 = Dov|last4 = Cohen|first5 = Ivan|last5 = Hernandez|volume=27}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thinkers ranging from [[Charles de Secondat, Baron de Montesquieu|Montesquieu]] to [[Steven Pinker]] have remarked upon the mindset needed for a culture of honour.

According to Richard Nisbett, cultures of honour will often arise when three conditions&lt;ref name=coh&gt;
Richard Nisbett. ''Culture of Honor''. 1996. {{ISBN|0-8133-1992-7}}
&lt;/ref&gt; exist:

# a scarcity of resources
# situations in which the benefit of theft and crime outweighs the risks
# a lack of sufficient law-enforcement (such as in geographically remote regions)

Historically, cultures of honour exist in places where the herding of animals dominates an economy. In this situation the geography is usually extensive, since the soil cannot support extensive sustained farming and thus large populations; the benefit of stealing animals from other herds is high since it is the main form of wealth; and there is no central law-enforcement or rule of law. However cultures of honour can also appear in places like modern inner-city slums. The three conditions exist here as well: lack of resources (poverty); crime and theft have a high rewards compared to the alternatives (few); and law enforcement is generally lax or corrupt.&lt;ref name=coh/&gt;

Once a culture of honour exists in a society, its members find it difficult to make the transition to a culture of law; this requires that people become willing to back down and refuse to immediately retaliate, and from the viewpoint of the culture of honour, the feeling humiliation makes personal restraint extremely difficult as it reflects weakness and appeasement.

==Honour as a cause of war ==
===The War of 1812===
Historian Norman Risjord has emphasised the central importance of honor as a cause of the [[War of 1812]], which the United States launched in against Britain despite its much more powerful naval and military strength.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Risjord | first1 = Norman K. | year = | title = 1812: Conservatives, War Hawks and the Nation's Honor | journal = William and Mary Quarterly: A Magazine of Early American History | volume = 1961 | issue = | pages = 196–210 | jstor=1918543}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Americans of every political stripe saw the need to uphold national honor, and to reject  the treatment of the United States by Britain as a third class nonentity. Americans talked incessantly about the need for force in response.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Ivie | first1 = Robert L. | year = 1982 | title = The metaphor of force in prowar discourse: The case of 1812 | url = | journal = Quarterly Journal of Speech | volume = 68 | issue = 3| pages = 240–253 | doi=10.1080/00335638209383610}}&lt;/ref&gt; This quest for honor was a major cause of the war in the sense that most Americans who were not involved in mercantile interests or threatened by Indian attack strongly endorsed the preservation of national honor.&lt;ref&gt;Bradford Perkins, ''The causes of the War of 1812: National honor or national interest?'' (1962).&lt;/ref&gt; [[Chesapeake–Leopard Affair|The humiliating attack]] by HMS ''Leopard'' against USS ''Chesapeake'' in June 1807 was a decisive event.&lt;ref&gt;Spencer  Tucker, ''Injured Honor: The Chesapeake-Leopard Affair, June 22'', 1807  (Naval Institute Press, 1996)&lt;/ref&gt;  Historians have documented  the importance of honor in shaping public opinion in a number of states, including Massachusetts,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Barlow | first1 = William | last2 = Powell | first2 = David O. | year = 1978 | title = Congressman Ezekiel Bacon of Massachusetts and the Coming of the War of 1812 | url = | journal = Historical Journal of Massachusetts | volume = 6 | issue = 2| page = 28 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Ohio,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Barlow | first1 = William R. | year = 1963 | title = Ohio's Congressmen and the War of 1812 | url = | journal = Ohio History | volume = 72 | issue = | pages = 175–94 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Pennsylvania,&lt;ref&gt;Victor Sapio, ''Pennsylvania and the War of 1812'' (University Press of Kentucky, 2015)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Martin Kaufman, "War Sentiment in Western Pennsylvania: 1812."

:National honor, the reputation of republican government, and the continuing supremacy of the Republican party had seemed to be at stake&amp;nbsp;... National honor had [now] been satisfied," says historian Lance Banning, "Americans celebrated the end of the struggle with a brilliant burst of national pride.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Lance Banning|title=The Jeffersonian Persuasion: Evolution of a Party Ideology|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=YL-HcJj1MO0C&amp;pg=PA295|year=1980|publisher=Cornell UP|page=295}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The British showed a respect for American honor. "Some of the strongest praise for America and swiftest recognition of what the young republic had achieved for American honor, prestige, and power came from within British naval circles."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Pietro S. Nivola|author2=Peter J.

=== U.S. Presidents raised in honour cultures ===

A 2016 study suggests that honour culture increases the risk of war. The study found that international conflicts under U.S. presidents who were raised in the American South "are shown to be twice as likely to involve uses of force, last on average twice as long, and are three times more likely to end in victory for the United States than disputes under non-Southern presidents. Other characteristics of Southern presidencies do not seem able to account for this pattern of results."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Dafoe|first=Allan|last2=Caughey|first2=Devin|date=2016-04-01|title=Honor and War|url=http://journals.cambridge.org/article_S0043887115000416|journal=World Politics|volume=68|issue=02|pages=341–381|doi=10.1017/S0043887115000416|issn=1086-3338}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Working towards eliminating [[violence against women]] in the name of honor was in 2001 the aim of United Nations resolution 55/66 which was adopted by the [[UN general assembly|General Assembly]].&lt;ref name="un_res_55_66"&gt;{{cite web|title=55/66.

In contemporary [[international relations]], the concept of "credibility" resembles that of honour, as when the credibility of a state or of an alliance appears to be at stake, and honour-bound politicians call for drastic measures.

Compare the concepts of [[integrity]] and [[Face (social concept)|face]] in [[stereotype]]d East Asian cultures, or of [[mana]] in [[Polynesia]]n society.

The [[ancient Greek]] concepts of honour (''timē'') included not only the exaltation of the one receiving honour, but also the shaming of the one overcome by the act of [[hubris]]. This concept of honour resembles a [[zero-sum game]].

In ancient [[China]] during the [[Warring States]] period, honour in battle was one of the many forms of virtue practised by the nobility. In one oft-cited example, [[Duke Xiang of Song|Duke Xiang]] of the Song state chose not to take the enemy by surprise; instead, he and his forces waited for the enemy to go across the river.  This marked conduct worthy of the accolade descriptor ''ren'' ([[wikt:仁|仁]]), worthy of the name of "gentleman". In response to this textbook example, Mao Zedong is quoted: "We are not Duke Xiang of Song and have no use for his idiotic virtue and morality."

Pre-modern [[Korea]]n thought and society was largely dominated by the preservation of honour and was especially concerned with the ruling [[yangban]] elite in the [[Joseon]] dynasty. In particular, one of the most profound influences from the Joseon Dynasty is the figure of the [[Seonbi]], or "virtuous scholar". The seonbi were ideal, exemplary noblemen of Confucian teachings who exhibited high competency in both academics and martial arts. Despite their obvious qualifications for important government posts, the seonbi eschewed titles and extravagance for the sake of personal development, often living in humble homes. They were expected to be fiercely loyal to the [[King of Joseon]] and lay down their lives in battle or in defense of their King, rather than choose treason. Inspired by the righteous nature of the seonbi, the modern Korean term of the "seonbi spirit" calls for maintaining personal honour and conduct, even in the face of certain death.

According to [[Bushido]], honour was always seen as a duty by [[Samurai]].{{cn|date=May 2017}} When one lost their honour or the situation made them lose it, the only way to save their dignity was by death. [[Seppuku]] (vulgarly called "[[harakiri]]", or "belly-cutting") was the most honourable death in that situation. The only way for a Samurai to die more honourably was to be killed in a battle by a sword.{{cn|date=May 2017}}

== Awards ==
[[File:Panteón de Hombres Ilustres (Madrid) 02a.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Honor Mosaic c 1914 in the [[Pantheon of Illustrious Men]], Madrid (Spain)]]
As a countable noun, ''honour'' may refer to an award, e.g. given   by the [[State (polity)|state]]. Such honours include military [[medal]]s, but more typically imply a civilian award, such as a British [[Order of the British Empire|OBE]], a [[knighthood]] or membership of the French [[Légion d'honneur]].

See also, [[List of prizes, medals, and awards]]; and [[Chivalric order]].

==Early life==
Born in [[Port of Spain]], Jones was an altar boy and sang in the choir at St Patrick's RC Church while attending Newtown Boys' RC primary school. He later attended [[Fatima College]]. He was the grandson of the St Patrick's organist Ivy Telfer. His mother was Monica Jones, a British journalist, and his father, Mervyn Telfer, a television broadcaster on the national TV station [[Trinidad and Tobago Television|Trinidad and Tobago Television (TTT)]]. Monica later married [[Rex Lassalle]], one of the leaders of a Regiment mutiny on April 21, 1970 (''see [[Black Power Revolution]]''). Jones was bullied as a child because "it was obvious to others" he was gay. He said in a newspaper interview that his parents "outed" him: “One day they sat me down and had a talk with me because there was so much homophobic bullying happening to me and I didn’t even know what a ''bullerman'' [a [[Homophobia|homophobic]] slur in Trinidad] was. They sat me down and explained what it meant. They didn’t avoid the pink elephant in the room.”&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://archives.newsday.co.tt/2017/03/05/jason-jones-altar-boy-to-fighter/|title=Jason Jones: Altar boy to fighter - Trinidad and Tobago Newsday Archives|date=2017-03-05|work=Trinidad and Tobago Newsday Archives|access-date=2018-04-15|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jones was a singer and left Trinidad in the 1985 to pursue his singing career in the UK.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

==Jones v Trinidad and Tobago==
Jones returned to Trinidad and Tobago in 1992 and 1996 but "was forced away again" to the UK to avoid "persecution" and "[[homophobia]]".&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; He received death threats in Trinidad for his activism&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.outrightinternational.org/content/interview-jason-jones-activist-challenging-trinidad-and-tobago%E2%80%99s-anti-gay-law|title=Interview with Jason Jones, the Activist Challenging Trinidad and Tobago’s Anti-Gay Law|last=mmoneymaker|date=2017-03-03|work=OutRight|access-date=2018-04-15|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.washingtonblade.com/2017/03/14/activist-threatened-challenging-trinidad-tobago-sodomy-law/|title=Activist threatened for challenging Trinidad and Tobago sodomy law|date=2017-03-14|work=Washington Blade: Gay News, Politics, LGBT Rights|access-date=2018-04-15|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;. In 2010 and 2014 he returned to Trinidad and Tobago but returned to the UK again in the face of "intolerable" homophobia.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; He filed the historic lawsuit in the High Court of Trinidad and Tobago on February 23, 2017,&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.jamaicaobserver.com/news/Gay-activist-files-lawsuit-challenging-Sexual-Offences-Act-in-T-T|title=Gay activist files lawsuit challenging Sexual Offences Act in T&amp;T|last=Limited|first=Jamaica Observer|website=Jamaica Observer|access-date=2018-04-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; challenging the constitutionality of Sections 13 and 16 in the Sexual Offences Act on the basis that: the “very existence of these sections continuously and directly affects the claimant’s private life by forcing him to either respect the law and refrain from engaging – even in private with consenting male partners – in prohibited sexual acts to which he is disposed by reason of his homosexual orientation, or to commit the prohibited acts and thereby become liable to criminal prosecution”.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; The lawsuit claimed the legislation infringed on his rights to privacy and freedom of thought and expression, and contravened his human rights.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; He further claimed those sections of the Act opened him up to ridicule and persecution because they criminalized consensual adult homosexual acts.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; 

Jones was represented by Richard Drabble QC, Rishi Dass and Antonio Emmanuel; and the State by Fyard Hosein, SC, Keisha Prosper and Lesley Almarales.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

The court heard arguments in January 2018&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.guardian.co.tt/news/2018-01-31/judge-sets-april-12-for-decision-in-lgbt-lawsuit|title=Judge sets April 12 for decision in LGBT lawsuit|website=The Trinidad Guardian Newspaper|access-date=2018-04-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; and delivered its judgment on April 12, 2018.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; 

In his judgement Justice Devindra Rampersad said Jones had proved the State's retention of the pertinent sections had “everything to do with homosexuality and the colonial abhorrence to the practice.”&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; “It is a threat that is sanctioned by the State and that sanction is an important sanction because it justifies in the mind of others in society who are differently minded that the very lifestyle, life and existence of a person who chooses to live, in the way that the claimant does, is criminal and is deemed of a lesser value than anyone else. Those criminal sanctions have the potential to be used oppressively by differently minded citizens as a foundation for hate as condoned by the State,” the judgement said.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Rampersad said of LGBTQI+ people in his judgment: “That is not their identity. That is not their soul. That is not the sum total of their value to society or their value to themselves. The experiences of apartheid South African and the USA during and after slavery, even into the mid- and late 20th century, have shown the depths that human dignity has been plunged as a result of presupposed and predetermined prejudices based on factors that do not accept or recognise humanity. Racial segregation, apartheid, the Holocaust – these are all painful memories of this type of prejudice.”&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

The law cannot simply be struck from the books because of the Savings Provision of the Trinidad and Tobago Constitution, which retains laws that were in force before the Constitution was enacted in 1976. What Trinidadians and Tobagonians call the "Buggery Law" was inherited from the British legal code. However, since the original law was amended twice to raise penalties against homosexual sex acts, Jones argued the savings clause is not relevant.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

The Attorney General, Faris Al-Rawi, has since promised to appeal the ruling.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://newsday.co.tt/2018/04/13/govt-to-appeal-buggery-ruling/|title=Govt to appeal buggery ruling - Trinidad and Tobago Newsday|date=2018-04-13|work=Trinidad and Tobago Newsday|access-date=2018-04-15|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[geometry]] and [[topology]], the '''line at infinity''' is a [[projective line]] that is added to the real (affine) [[plane (geometry)|plane]] in order to give closure to, and remove the exceptional cases from, the [[incidence (geometry)|incidence]] properties of the resulting [[projective plane]].  The line at infinity is also called the '''ideal line'''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Weisstein|first1=Eric W.|title=Line at Infinity|url=http://mathworld.wolfram.com/LineatInfinity.html|website=mathworld.wolfram.com|publisher=Wolfram Research|accessdate=28 December 2016|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Geometric formulation==
In projective geometry, any pair of lines always intersects at some point, but [[Parallel (geometry)|parallel]] lines do not intersect in the real plane.  The line at infinity is added to the real plane. This completes the plane, because now parallel lines intersect at a point which lies on the line at infinity. Also, if any pair of lines intersect at a point on the line at infinity, then the pair of lines are parallel.

Every line intersects the line at infinity at some point. The point at which the parallel lines intersect depends only on the [[slope]] of the lines, not at all on their [[y-intercept]].

In the affine plane, a line extends in two opposite directions. In the projective plane, the two opposite directions of a line meet each other at a point on the line at infinity.  Therefore, lines in the projective plane are [[closed curve]]s, i.e., they are cyclical rather than linear. This is true of the line at infinity itself; it meets itself at its two endpoints (which are therefore not actually endpoints at all) and so it is actually cyclical.

==Topological perspective==
The line at infinity can be visualized as a circle which surrounds the affine plane.  However, diametrically opposite points of the circle are equivalent—they are the same point. The combination of the affine plane and the line at infinity makes the [[real projective plane]], &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{R}P^2&lt;/math&gt;&lt;!--''RP&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;''--&gt;.

A [[hyperbola]] can be seen as a closed curve which intersects the line at infinity in two different points.  These two points are specified by the slopes of the two [[asymptote]]s of the hyperbola.  Likewise, a [[parabola]] can be seen as a closed curve which intersects the line at infinity in a single point.  This point is specified by the slope of the axis of the parabola.  If the parabola is cut by its vertex into a symmetrical pair of "horns", then these two horns become more parallel to each other further away from the vertex, and are actually parallel to the axis and to each other at infinity, so that they intersect at the line at infinity.

The analogue for the complex projective plane is a 'line' at infinity that is (naturally) a complex [[projective line]]. Topologically this is quite different, in that it is a [[Riemann sphere]], which is therefore a 2-[[sphere]], being added to a complex affine space of two dimensions over ''C'' (so four ''real'' dimensions), resulting in a four-dimensional [[compact space|compact]] [[manifold]]. The result is [[orientable]], while the real projective plane is not.

==History==
The complex line at infinity was much used in nineteenth century geometry. In fact one of the most applied tricks was to regard a circle as a [[conic]] constrained to pass through two points at infinity, the solutions of

:''X''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; + ''Y''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = 0.

This equation is the form taken by that of any circle when we drop terms of lower order in ''X'' and ''Y''. More formally, we should use [[homogeneous coordinates]]

:[''X:Y:Z'']

and note that the line at infinity is specified by setting

: ''Z'' = 0.

Making equations homogeneous by introducing powers of ''Z'', and then setting ''Z'' = 0, does precisely eliminate terms of lower order.

Solving the equation, therefore, we find that all circles 'pass through' the ''[[circular points at infinity]]''

:''I'' = [1:''i'':0] and ''J'' = [1:&amp;minus;''i'':0].

These of course are complex points, for any representing set of homogeneous coordinates. Since the projective plane has a large enough [[symmetry group]], they are in no way special, though. The conclusion is that the three-parameter family of circles can be treated as a special case of the [[Linear system of divisors|linear system]] of conics passing through two given distinct points ''P'' and ''Q''. &lt;!--REMOVED UNCITED TEXT: This idea was used so often that a schoolmasterly joke arose, naming the circular points at infinity ''Isaac'' and ''Jacob'', respectively.--&gt;

[[Inverse problem|Inverse modeling]] is a mathematical technique where the objective is to determine the physical properties of the subsurface of an earth region that has produced a given [[seismogram]]. Cooke and Schneider (1983)&lt;ref name="Cook1983"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Cooke|first=D. A.|author2=Schneider W. A. |title=Generalized linear inversion of reflection seismic data|journal=Geophysics|date=June 1983|volume=48|issue=6|pages=665–676|doi=10.1190/1.1441497}}&lt;/ref&gt; defined it as calculation of the earth’s structure and physical [[parameters]] from some set of observed [[seismic]] data. The underlying assumption in this method is that the collected seismic data are from an earth structure that matches the cross-section computed from the inversion [[algorithm]].&lt;ref name="Pica1990"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Pica|first=A.|author2=Diet J. P. |author3=Tarantola A. |title=Nonlinear inversion of seismic reflection data in a laterally invariant medium|journal=Geophysics|date=March 1990|volume=55|issue=3|pages=284–292|doi=10.1190/1.1442836}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some common earth properties that are inverted for include acoustic velocity, [[Formation (stratigraphy)|formation]] and fluid [[Density|densities]], [[acoustic impedance]], [[Poisson's ratio]], formation compressibility, shear rigidity, [[porosity]], and fluid saturation.

The method has long been useful for geophysicists and can be categorized into two broad types:&lt;ref name="Earthworks"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Francis|first=A.M.|title=Understanding Stochastic and Seismic Inversion|journal=First Break|date=November 2006|volume=24|issue=11|doi=10.3997/1365-2397.2006026}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Deterministic algorithm|Deterministic]] and [[stochastic]] inversion. Deterministic inversion methods are based on comparison of the output from an earth model with the observed field data and continuously updating the earth model parameters to minimize a function, which is usually some form of difference between model output and field observation. As such, this method of inversion to which linear inversion falls under is posed as an minimization problem and the accepted earth model is the set of model parameters that minimizes the [[objective function]] in producing a numerical seismogram which best compares with collected field seismic data.

On the other hand, stochastic inversion methods are used to generate constrained models as used in [[reservoir]] flow simulation, using geostatistical tools like [[kriging]]. As opposed to deterministic inversion methods which produce a single set of model parameters, stochastic methods generate a suite of alternate earth model parameters which all obey the model constraint. However, the two methods are related as the results of deterministic models is the average of all the possible non-unique solutions of stochastic methods.&lt;ref name="Earthworks"/&gt; Since seismic linear inversion is a deterministic inversion method, the stochastic method will not be discussed beyond this point.

== Linear inversion ==

The [[Deterministic algorithm|deterministic]] nature of [[Inverse problem|linear inversion]] requires a [[Function (mathematics)|functional]] relationship which models, in terms of the earth model [[parameters]], the seismic variable to be inverted. This functional relationship is some mathematical model derived from the fundamental laws of physics and is more often called a forward model. The aim of the technique is to minimize a function which is dependent on the difference between the convolution of the forward model with a source [[wavelet]] and the field collected [[seismic trace]]. As in the field of optimization, this function to be minimized is called the [[objective function]] and in convectional inverse modeling, is simply the difference between the convolved forward model and the seismic trace. As earlier mentioned, different types of variables can be inverted for but for clarity, these variables will be referred to as the [[Wave impedance|impedance]] series of the earth model. In the following subsections we will describe in more detail, in the context of linear inversion as a minimization problem, the different components that are necessary to invert seismic data.

=== Forward model ===

The centerpiece of seismic linear inversion is the forward model which models the generation of the experimental data collected.&lt;ref name="Cook1983"/&gt; According to Wiggins (1972),&lt;ref name="wiggns1972"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Wiggins|first=Ralph|title=The general linear inverse problem: Implication of surface waves and free oscillations for Earth structure|journal=Reviews of Geophysics|date=February 1972|volume=10|issue=1|pages=251–285|doi=10.1029/RG010i001p00251}}&lt;/ref&gt; it provides a functional (computational) relationship between the model parameters and calculated values for the observed traces. Depending on the seismic data collected, this model may vary from the classical [[wave equation]]s for predicting [[particle displacement]] or fluid pressure for sound wave propagation through rock or fluids, to some variants of these classical equations. For example, the forward model in Tarantola (1984)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Tarantola|first=A.|title=Linearized and inversion of seismic reflection-data|journal=Geophysical Prospecting|year=1984|volume=32|issue=6|pages=908–1015|doi=10.1111/j.1365-2478.1984.tb00751.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; is the wave equation for pressure variation in a liquid media during seismic wave propagation while by assuming constant velocity layers with plane interfaces, Kanasewich and Chiu (1985)&lt;ref name="kan"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Kanasewich|first=E. R.|author2=Chiu S. K. L |title=Least squares inversion of spatial seismic refraction data|journal=Bulletin of the Seismological Society of America|date=June 1985|volume=75|issue=3|pages=865–880|url=http://bssa.geoscienceworld.org/content/75/3/865.abstract}}&lt;/ref&gt; used the brachistotrone model of John Bernoulli for travel time of a [[Ray (geometry)|ray]] along a path. In Cooke and Schneider (1983),&lt;ref name="Cook1983"/&gt; the model is a synthetic trace generation algorithm expressed as in Eqn. 3, where R(t) is generated in the Z-domain by recursive formula. In whatever form the forward model appears, it is important that it not only predicts the collected field data, but also models how the data is generated. Thus, the forward model by Cooke and Schneider (1983)&lt;ref name="Cook1983"/&gt; can only be used to invert CMP data since the model invariably assumes no spreading loss by mimicking the response of a laterally [[homogeneous]] earth to a plane-wave source

&lt;ol start="1"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;math&gt;t=\sum_{i=1}^n\frac{\big[(x_i-x_{i-1})^2+(y_i-y_{i-1})^2+(z_i-z_{i-1})^2\big]^{\frac{1}{2}}}{v_i}&lt;/math&gt; &lt;/li&gt;

where t is ray travel time, x, y, z are depth coordinates and vi is the constant velocity between interfaces i − 1 and i.

&lt;li&gt;&lt;math&gt;\left[\frac{1}{K(\vec{r})}\frac{\partial^2}{\partial t^2}-\nabla\cdot\big(\frac{1}{\rho(\vec{r}\big)}\nabla)\right] U(\vec{r},t)= s(\vec{r},t)
&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;K(\vec{r})&lt;/math&gt; represent bulk modulus, &lt;math&gt;\rho(\vec{r})&lt;/math&gt; density, &lt;math&gt;s(\vec{r},t)&lt;/math&gt; the source of acoustic waves, and &lt;math&gt;U(\vec{r},t)&lt;/math&gt;  the pressure variation.

&lt;li&gt;&lt;math&gt;s(t)=w(t)*R(t)&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

where ''s''(''t'') = synthetic trace, ''w''(''t'') = source wavelet, and ''R''(''t'') = reflectivity function.

===Objective function===

An important numerical process in inverse modeling is to minimize the objective function, which is a function defined in terms of the difference between the collected field seismic data and the numerically computed seismic data. Classical objective functions include the sum of squared deviations between experimental and numerical data, as in the [[least squares]] methods, the sum of the [[Magnitude (mathematics)|magnitude]] of the difference between field and numerical data, or some variant of these definitions. Irrespective of the definition used, numerical solution of the inverse problem is obtained as earth model that minimize the objective function.

In addition to the objective function, other constraints like known model parameters and known layer interfaces in some regions of the earth are also incorporated in the inverse modeling procedure. These constraints, according to Francis 2006,&lt;ref name="Earthworks"/&gt; help to reduce non-uniqueness of the inversion solution by providing a priori information that is not contained in the inverted data while Cooke and Schneider (1983)&lt;ref name="Cook1983"/&gt; reports their useful in controlling noise and when working in a geophysically well-known area.

===Mathematical analysis of generalized linear inversion procedure===

The objective of mathematical analysis of inverse modeling is to cast the generalized linear inverse problem into a simple [[Matrix (mathematics)|matrix]] algebra by considering all the components described in previous sections. viz; forward model, objective function etc. Generally, the numerically generated seismic data are non-linear functions of the earth model parameters. To remove the non-linearity and create a platform for application of [[linear algebra]] concepts, the forward model is [[Linearization|linearized]] by expansion using a [[Taylor series]] as carried out below. For more details see Wiggins (1972),&lt;ref name="wiggns1972"/&gt; Cooke and Schneider (1983).&lt;ref name="Cook1983"/&gt;

Consider a set of &lt;math&gt;m&lt;/math&gt; seismic field observations &lt;math&gt;F_j&lt;/math&gt;, for &lt;math&gt;j = 1, \ldots, m&lt;/math&gt; and a set of &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; earth model parameters &lt;math&gt;p_i&lt;/math&gt; to be inverted for, for &lt;math&gt;i=1,\ldots, n&lt;/math&gt;. The field observations can be represented in either &lt;math&gt;\vec{F}\,(\vec{p})&lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt;F_j\,(p_i)&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;\vec{p}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\vec{F}\,(\vec{p})&lt;/math&gt; are vectorial representations of model parameters and the field observations as a function of earth parameters. Similarly, for &lt;math&gt;q_i&lt;/math&gt; representing guesses of model parameters, &lt;math&gt;\vec{F}\,(\vec{q})&lt;/math&gt; is the vector of numerical computed seismic data using the forward model of Sec. 1.3. Taylor's series expansion of &lt;math&gt;\vec{F}\,(\vec{p})&lt;/math&gt; about &lt;math&gt;\vec{q}&lt;/math&gt; is given below.

&lt;ol start="4"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;math&gt;\vec{F}\,(\vec{p}) = \vec{F}\,(\vec{q})+(\vec{p}-\vec{q})\frac{\partial \vec{F}\,(\vec{q})}{\partial \vec{p}}+(\vec{p}-\vec{q})^2\frac{\partial^2 \vec{F}\,(\vec{q})}{\partial \vec{p}^2} +O(\vec{p}-\vec{q})^3&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

On linearization by dropping the non-linear terms (terms with (p⃗ − ⃗q) of order 2 and above), the equation becomes

&lt;li&gt;&lt;math&gt;\vec{F}\,(\vec{p}) - \vec{F}\,(\vec{q})=(\vec{p}-\vec{q})\frac{\partial \vec{F}\,(\vec{q})}{\partial \vec{p}}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

Considering that &lt;math&gt;\vec{F}&lt;/math&gt; has &lt;math&gt;m&lt;/math&gt; components and &lt;math&gt;\vec{p}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\vec{q}&lt;/math&gt; have &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; components, the discrete form of Eqn. 5 results in a system of &lt;math&gt;m&lt;/math&gt; [[linear equation]]s in &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; variables whose matrix form is shown below.

&lt;li&gt;&lt;math&gt;\Delta \vec{F} = \mathbf{A}\,\Delta\vec{p}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;math&gt;\Delta\vec{F} = \begin{bmatrix}F_1(\vec{p})-F_1(\vec{q})\\\vdots\\F_m(\vec{p})-F_m(\vec{q})\end{bmatrix}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;math&gt;\Delta\vec{p} = \vec{p}-\vec{q} = 
\begin{bmatrix}
p_1-q_1\\
\vdots	\\
p_n-q_n
\end{bmatrix}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{A} = 
\begin{bmatrix}
\frac{\partial F_1(\vec{q})}{\partial p_1} &amp; \frac{\partial F_1(\vec{q})}{\partial p_2} &amp; \cdots &amp; \frac{\partial F_1(\vec{q})}{\partial p_n} \\
\frac{\partial F_2(\vec{q})}{\partial p_1} &amp; \cdots &amp;  \frac{\partial F_2(\vec{q})}{\partial p_{n-1}} &amp; \frac{\partial F_2(\vec{q})}{\partial p_n} \\
\vdots	&amp;  \frac{\partial F_j(\vec{q})}{\partial p_i} &amp; \vdots &amp; \vdots \\
\frac{\partial F_m(\vec{q})}{\partial p_1} &amp; \frac{\partial F_m(\vec{q})}{\partial p_2} &amp; \cdots &amp; \frac{\partial F_m(\vec{q})}{\partial p_n} \\
\end{bmatrix}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;math&gt;\Delta \vec{F}&lt;/math&gt; is called the difference [[vector (mathematics and physics)|vector]] in Cooke and Schneider (1983).&lt;ref name="Cook1983"/&gt; It has a size of &lt;math&gt;m\times 1&lt;/math&gt; and its components are the difference between the observed trace and the numerically computed seismic data. &lt;math&gt;\Delta\vec{p}&lt;/math&gt; is the corrector vector of size &lt;math&gt;n\times 1&lt;/math&gt;, while &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{A}&lt;/math&gt; is called the sensitivity matrix. It has a size of &lt;math&gt;m\times n&lt;/math&gt; and its comments are such that each column is the [[partial derivative]] of a component of the forward function with respect to one of the unknown earth model parameters. Similarly, each row is the partial derivative of a component of the numerically computed seismic trace with respect to all unknown model parameters.

===Solution algorithm===

&lt;math&gt;\vec{F}\,(\vec{q})&lt;/math&gt; is computed from the forward model, while &lt;math&gt;\vec{F}\,(\vec{p})&lt;/math&gt; is the experimental data. Thus,&lt;math&gt;\Delta \vec{F}&lt;/math&gt; is a known quality. On the other hand, &lt;math&gt;\Delta\vec{p}&lt;/math&gt; is unknown and is obtained by solution of Eqn. 10. This equation is theoretically solvable only when &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{A}&lt;/math&gt; is invertible, that is, if it is a square matrix so that the number of observations &lt;math&gt;m&lt;/math&gt; is equal to the number &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; of unknown earth parameters. If this is the case, the unknown corrector vector &lt;math&gt;\Delta\vec{p}&lt;/math&gt;, is solved for as shown below, using any of the classical direct or iterative solvers for solution of a set of linear equations.

&lt;ol start="10"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;math&gt;\Delta \vec{p} = \mathbf{A}^{-1}\,\Delta\vec{F}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

In most [[seismic inversion]] applications, there are more observations than the number of earth parameters to be inverted for, i.e. &lt;math&gt;m&gt;n&lt;/math&gt;, leading to a system of equations that is mathematically over-determined. As a result, Eqn. 10 is not theoretically solvable and an exact solution is not obtainable.&lt;ref name="kan"/&gt; An estimate of the corrector vector is obtained using the least squares procedure to find the corrector vector &lt;math&gt;\Delta \vec{p}&lt;/math&gt; that minimizes &lt;math&gt;\vec{e}\,^T \vec{e}&lt;/math&gt;, which is the sum of the squares of the error, &lt;math&gt;\vec{e}&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref name="kan"/&gt;

The error&lt;math&gt;\vec{e}&lt;/math&gt; is given by

 &lt;ol start="11"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;math&gt;\vec{e} = \Delta\vec{F}-\mathbf{A}\,\Delta \vec{p}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

In the least squares procedure, the corrector vector that minimizes &lt;math&gt;\vec{e}\,^T\vec{e}&lt;/math&gt; is obtained as below.

&lt;ol start="12"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
\mathbf{A}\,\Delta \vec{p} &amp;=\Delta\vec{F}\\
\mathbf{A}^T\mathbf{A}\,\Delta \vec{p}  &amp;= \mathbf{A}^T\Delta\vec{F}
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

Thus,

&lt;ol start="13"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;math&gt;
\Delta \vec{p}  = (\mathbf{A}^T\mathbf{A})^{-1}\,\mathbf{A}^T\Delta\vec{F}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

From the above discussions, the objective function is defined as either the &lt;math&gt;L_1&lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt;L_2&lt;/math&gt; norm of &lt;math&gt;\Delta \vec{p}&lt;/math&gt; given by
&lt;math&gt;\sum_{j=0}^n|\Delta p_j|&lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt;\sum_{j=0}^n|\Delta p_j|^2&lt;/math&gt; or of &lt;math&gt;\Delta \vec{F}&lt;/math&gt; given by &lt;math&gt;\sum_{i=0}^m|\Delta F_i|&lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt;\sum_{i=0}^m|\Delta F_i|^2&lt;/math&gt;.

The generalized procedure for inverting any experimental seismic data for &lt;math&gt;m = n&lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt;m &gt;n&lt;/math&gt;, using the mathematical theory for inverse modeling, as described above, is shown in Fig. 1 and described as follows.

An initial guess of the model impedance is provided to initiate the inversion process. The forward model uses this initial guess to compute a synthetic seismic data which is subtracted from the observed seismic data to calculate the difference vector.

# An initial guess of the model impedance &lt;math&gt;\vec{q}&lt;/math&gt; is provided to initiate the inversion process.
# A synthetic seismic data &lt;math&gt;\vec{F}(\vec{q})&lt;/math&gt; is computed by the forward model, using the model impedance above.
# The difference vector &lt;math&gt;\vec{F}(\vec{p})-\vec{F}(\vec{q})&lt;/math&gt; is computed as the difference between experimental and synthetic seismic data.
# The sensitivity matrix &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{A}&lt;/math&gt; is computed at this value of the impedance profile.
# Using &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{A}&lt;/math&gt; and the difference vector from 3 above, the corrector vector &lt;math&gt;\Delta \vec{p}&lt;/math&gt; is calculated. A new impedance profile is obtained as &lt;ol start="14"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;math&gt;\vec{p}=\vec{q}+\Delta \vec{p}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;
# The &lt;math&gt;L_1&lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt;L_2&lt;/math&gt; norm of the computed corrector vector is compared with a provided tolerance value. If the computed norm is less than the tolerance, the numerical procedure is concluded and the inverted impedance profile for the earth region is given by &lt;math&gt;\vec{p}&lt;/math&gt; from Eqn. 14. On the other hand, if the norm is greater than the tolerance, iterations through steps 2-6 are repeated but with an updated impedance profile as computed from Eqn. 14. Fig. 2&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Cooke|first=D|author2=Cant J. |title=Model-based seismic inversion: Comparing deterministic and probabilistic approaches|journal=CSEG Recorder|date=April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; shows a typical example of impedance profile updating during successive iteration process. According to Cooke and Schneider (1983),&lt;ref name="Cook1983"/&gt; use of the corrected guess from Eqn. 14 as the new initial guess during iteration reduces the error.

==Parameterization of the earth model space==

Irrespective of the variable to be inverted for, the earth’s impedance is a continuous function of depth (or time in seismic data) and for numerical linear inversion technique to be applicable for this continuous physical model, the continuous properties have to be discretized and/or sampled at discrete intervals along the depth of the earth model. Thus, the total depth over which model properties are to be determined is a necessary starting point for the discretization. Commonly, as shown in Fig. 3, this properties are sampled at close discrete intervals over this depth to ensure high resolution of impedance variation along the earth’s depth. The impedance values inverted from the [[algorithm]] represents the average value in the discrete interval.

Considering that inverse modeling problem is only theoretically solvable when the number of discrete intervals for sampling the properties is equal to the number of observation in the trace to be inverted, a high-resolution sampling will lead to a large matrix which will be very expensive to invert. Furthermore, the matrix may be singular for dependent equations, the inversion can be unstable in the presence of noise and the system may be under-constrained if parameters other than the primary variables inverted for, are desired. In relation to parameters desired, other than impedance, Cooke and Schneider (1983)&lt;ref name="Cook1983"/&gt; gives them to include source wavelet and scale factor.

Finally, by treating constraints as known impedance values in some layers or discrete intervals, the number of unknown impedance values to be solved for are reduced, leading to greater accuracy in the results of the inversion algorithm.

==Inversion examples==

===Temperature inversion from Marescot (2010)&lt;ref name="m"/&gt;===

We start with an example to invert for earth parameter values from temperature depth distribution in a given earth region. Although this example does not directly relate to [[seismic inversion]] since no traveling acoustic waves are involved, it nonetheless introduces practical application of the inversion technique in a manner easy to comprehend, before moving on to seismic applications. In this example, the temperature of the earth is measured at discrete locations in a well bore by placing temperature sensors in the target depths. By assuming a forward model of linear distribution of temperature with depth, two parameters are inverted for from the temperature depth measurements.

The forward model is given by
&lt;ol start="15"&gt;&lt;li&gt;
&lt;math&gt;\vec{F}(\vec{q}) = \vec{T} = a+bz&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\vec{q} = [a,b]&lt;/math&gt;. Thus, the dimension of &lt;math&gt;\vec{q}&lt;/math&gt; is 2 i.e. the number of parameters inverted for is 2.

The objective of this inversion algorithm is to find &lt;math&gt;\vec{p}&lt;/math&gt;, which is the value of &lt;math&gt;[a,b]&lt;/math&gt; that minimizes the difference between the observed temperature distribution and those obtained using the forward model of Eqn. 15. Considering the dimension of the forward model or the number of temperature observations to be &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt;, the components of the forward model is written as

&lt;ol start="16"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
T_1&amp;=a+bz_1		\\
T_2&amp;=a+bz_2	\\
\vdots	\\
T_{n-1}&amp;=a+bz_{n-1}		\\
T_n&amp;=a+bz_n	\\
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

so that &lt;math&gt;\vec{F}(\vec{q}) = T&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{A} = 
\begin{bmatrix}
1 &amp; z_1  \\
1 &amp; z_2  \\
\vdots &amp; \vdots	\\
1 &amp; z_{n-1}  \\
1 &amp; z_n  \\
\end{bmatrix}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;

We present results from Marescot (2010)&lt;ref name="m"&gt;{{cite web|last=Marescot|first=Laurent|title=Introduction to Inversion in Geophysics|url=http://www.tomoquest.com|accessdate=3 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; for the case of &lt;math&gt;n = 2&lt;/math&gt; for which the observed temperature values at depths were &lt;math&gt;T_1 = 19 ^{\circ}C&lt;/math&gt; at &lt;math&gt;z=2m&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;T_2=22^{\circ}C&lt;/math&gt; at &lt;math&gt;z=8m&lt;/math&gt;. These experimental data were inverted to obtain earth parameter values of &lt;math&gt;a = 0.5&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;b=18^{\circ}C&lt;/math&gt;. For a more general case with large number of temperature observations, Fig. 4 shows the final linear forward model obtained from using the inverted values of &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;b&lt;/math&gt;. The figure shows a good match between experimental and numerical data.

===Wave travel time inversion from Marescot (2010)&lt;ref name="m"/&gt;===

This examples inverts for earth layer [[velocity]] from recorded seismic wave travel times. Fig. 5 shows the initial velocity guesses and the travel times recorded from the field, while Fig. 6a shows the inverted [[heterogeneous]] velocity model, which is the solution of the inversion algorithm obtained after 30 [[iteration]]s. As seen in Fig. 6b, there is good comparison between the final travel times obtained from the forward model using the inverted velocity and the field record travel times. Using these solutions, the ray path was reconstructed and is shown to be highly tortuous through the earth model as shown in Fig. 7.

===Seismic trace inversion from Cooke and Schneider (1983)===

This example, taken from Cooke and Schneider (1983),&lt;ref name="Cook1983"/&gt; shows inversion of a CMP seismic trace for earth model impedance (product of density and velocity) profile. The seismic trace inverted is shown in Fig. 8 while Fig. 9a shows the inverted impedance profile with the input initial impedance used for the inversion algorithm. Also recorded alongside the seismic trace is an impedance log of the earth region as shown in Fig. 9b. The figures show good comparison between the recorded impedance log and the numerical inverted impedance from the seismic trace.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5073">The '''lynching at Włodowo''' took place in a village of [[Włodowo|Włodowo]] in North-Eastern [[Poland|Poland]] on 1 July 2005, when a group of local men killed a criminal Józef "Ciechanek" Ciechanowicz who was terrorizing the community.

== Background ==

Ciechanowicz was a 60 year old recidivist who spent over 30 years in prison, for batteries, thefts and rapes. During breaks between his times he was extorting pensions from elder people, bullying other residents of [[Włodowo|Włodowo]] and [[Brzydowo|Brzydowo]] villages and robbing local shops. According to relations of his neighbors, he was often wandering around while drunk, with an [[axe|axe]] or a [[cleaver|cleaver]] in his hand, mumbling that he will kill someone eventually, because he wants to go back home (prison). The police did not always respond to calls, and when they did, their intervention had no effect.

== Lynching ==

On the day of the event, Ciechanowicz entered the yard of Winek's family house where he saw Jagoda Rybak, daughter of his former concubine. The woman took her mother in hiding, after he had wounded her with screwdriver. Ciechanowicz was upset because he could no longer seize pension of her. Earlier he also broke a bottle on Jagoda’s head. Tomasz Winek, owner of the house, ordered him to leave but instead of retreating, Ciechanowicz drawed [[beetroot|beetroot]] [[cleaver|cleaver]]. Winek took a wooden bat from the pile and clashed with Ciechanowicz who swinged with a [[cleaver|cleaver]] aiming at Winek's head, who saved it with his hand, receiving a gash. Winek's neighbour came to help and forced Ciechanowicz to flee. In the meantime, Winek's wife called the police but heard that there are no police cars available at the moment. Later on they drove to [[Dobre Miasto|Dobre Miasto]] (nearby town) and visited medical and police station. Police officers were still refusing to accept crime's submission and send any officers to [[Włodowo|Włodowo]], claiming that none of them are available. After they returned, a group of locals (including two Winek's brothers) gathered. When Ciechanowicz returned, waiving his [[cleaver|cleaver]] and threatening that he will kill "you all and your brats" (four years old Winek's son was playing in the yard at the time), the group of men started to chase him. They caught him in the hollow near the forest and started to beat with bats, shovels and car spring. Though they confessed later, that he was still alive when they left him, he died from wounds. Later on that day other village dwellers were visiting the place, to ensure themselves if Ciechanowicz is dead.

== Trials ==

After the incident Tomasz Winek and his brothers Mirosław and Krzysztof were arrested for a short period but they were released by the prosecutor's decision on 7 November 2005. People of nearby villages gathered money for the best advocate for accused ones. On 23 October 2007 they were  sentenced for 2 years in prison with the suspension for the probation period of 3 years. However on 15 January 2009, appeal court changed the ruling to 4 years of prison, without suspension. On 18 December 2009, they were eventually pardoned by the president of [[Poland|Poland]] [[Lech Kaczyński|Lech Kaczyński]] - their sentence was put into the suspension for the period of 10 years of probation.

Other three persons involved into lynching received minor sentences in suspension for battery and desecration of a corpse.

Two police officers from [[Dobre Miasto|Dobre Miasto]] police station who did not react to calls for help also received prison sentences in suspension, for failure in complying to their duty tasks. One of them was dismissed from service and the other one was downgraded. The court did not accept their defense clarifications that they had no means to react and stressed, that they could ask nearby police stations and regional HQ to send reinforcements.

In January 2012 Winek brothers have been apprehended again for 48 hours in relation with the disappearance of a man living in their village. They were released without setting an accusation and later on court ruled financial compensation for them, evaluating the police action as “ungrounded show of power”.

== In popular culture ==

The event was pictured in television series "Pitbull" and "Kryminalni". It was also an inspiration for the  Polish thriller movie "Lincz".

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4100">The '''meson bomb''' was a proposed [[nuclear weapon]] that would derive its destructive force from [[meson]] interactions with [[fissionable material]] like [[uranium]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The idea behind the bomb was rejected by most scientists, but during the [[Cold War]], American intelligence managed to trick the [[Soviet Union]] into conducting research on this topic, which resulted in several years of wasted labor by one of the Soviet nuclear weapon research bureaus.{{citation needed|date=February 2016}}

==Origins==
Mesons ([[hadron]]ic [[subatomic particle]]s composed of one [[quark]] and one [[antiquark]], bound together by the [[strong interaction]]) were proposed to form a nuclear weapon as early as the 1940s. Early speculation suggested that the resulting bomb would be the most powerful nuclear weapon yet to have been developed.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite book|title=Science News|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=EL4PAAAAIAAJ|year=1948|publisher=Science Service|page=99|quote=The new tests do not, in all probability, involve any radically new and novel bombs, such as the hydrogen-helium bomb or the meson bomb about which there has been some speculation.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Iowa Engineer|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=4ZgiAQAAMAAJ|year=1945|publisher=Iowa State College|page=160|quote=If mesons could be produced in quantity, they might provide a "meson bomb," thousands of times as powerful as today's atom bomb.}}&lt;/ref&gt; American  physicist [[Ernest Lawrence]] used the potential military applications of mesons to obtain funding for its {{convert|184|inch|adj=on}} [[synchrocyclotron]] built between 1940 and 1946 at the [[University of California, Berkeley]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Carried by History: Cesar Lattes, Nuclear Emulsions, and the Discovery of the Pi-meson|journal = Physics in Perspective|date = 2014-03-29|issn = 1422-6944|pages = 3–36|volume = 16|issue = 1|doi = 10.1007/s00016-014-0128-6|language = en|first = Cássio Leite|last = Vieira|first2 = Antonio Augusto Passos|last2 = Videira}}&lt;/ref&gt; Soon, however, the scientific consensus was that construction of such a bomb would be impossible; and in 1968 physicist [[M. Stanley Livingston]] wrote that "no responsible scientists would attempt to justify support in this field with predictions of an 'anti-matter engine,' or a super 'meson bomb,' or a 'hyper-drive' for spaceships."&lt;ref name="Livingston1968"&gt;{{cite book|author=Milton Stanley Livingston|title=Particle Physics: The High-energy Frontier|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vIEKAAAAMAAJ|year=1968|publisher=McGraw-Hill|page=7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Soviet research==
In the 1960s, however, the Soviet Union became convinced that the United States had already developed the meson bomb, and devoted considerable resources to developing its own. In 1994, Russian physicist and chief constructor of nuclear weapons bureau [[KB-11]] (Design Bureau No. 11, set up in 1946) [[Arkadiy Brish]] stated that their work on the meson bomb was prompted by intelligence. Even though physicists [[Yuliy Borisovich Khariton]] and [[Yakov Borisovich Zel'dovich]] agreed that the reports were nonsensical, the directors of the [[Soviet atomic bomb project]] decided to pursue this line of research, which resulted in several years of fruitless labor. Brish attributed this to American [[disinformation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=We Copied the Charge Design, Not the Bomb Itself, Maintains Professor Arkadiy Brish, Doctor of Technical Sciences, One of the Developers of Soviet Nuclear Weapons.

'''Might makes right''' is an [[aphorism]] with several potential meanings (in order of increasing complexity):
{|
|valign="top"|{{nowrap|'''[[English language|English]]''':}}
|The idea associated with the phrase connotes that a society's view of [[Right (ethics)|right]] and [[wrong]] is determined, like its perspective on history, by those currently in power. The term can be used in the [[descriptive]], rather than [[prescriptive]] way, in the same sense that people say that "History is written by the victors". Because every person labels what they think is good for themselves as right, only those who are able to defeat their enemies can push their idea of what is right into [[wikt:fruition|fruition]]. The phrase is most often used in negative assessments of expressions of power.
|-
|valign="top"|{{nowrap|'''Kratocracy''':}}
|According to [[William Pepperell Montague|Montague]],&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ditext.com/runes/k.html|title=Dictionary of Philosophy|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; '''kratocracy''' or '''kraterocracy''' (from the Greek κρατερός ''krateros'', meaning "strong") is a government by those who are strong enough to seize power through [[coercive power]], social persuasion, or deceptive cunning. The term was used by [[Kropotkin]] in ''[[Mutual Aid: A Factor of Evolution]]'', but is now rarely seen. In terms of [[Master morality]], those who are the strongest will rule others and have the power to determine both right and wrong, and what constitutes "the greater good".  By this definition, the phrase manifests itself in a [[Norm (philosophy)|normative]] sense. This meaning is often used to define a proscriptive [[moral code]] for society to follow, as well as while discussing [[social Darwinism]] and [[Weberian]] themes of the authority of the state (e.g. ''[[Economy and Society|Wirtschaft und Gesellschaft]]'').
|}

==History==
The idea of "woe to the conquered" can be found in [[Homer]] and the [[The Hawk and the Nightingale|hawk parable]] in [[Hesiod]]'s ''[[Works and Days]]'' and in [[Livy]], in which "[[vae victis]]", Latin for "woe to the conquered", is first recorded.

The first commonly quoted use of ''might makes right'' in the English language was in 1846 by the American [[pacifist]] and [[Abolitionism in the United States|abolitionist]] [[Adin Ballou]] (1803–1890), who wrote, "But now, instead of discussion and argument, brute force rises up to the rescue of discomfited error, and crushes truth and right into the dust. 'Might makes right,' and hoary folly totters on in her mad career escorted by armies and navies." (Christian Non-Resistance: In All Its Important Bearings, Illustrated and Defended, 1846.)

The phrase in reverse is echoed in [[Abraham Lincoln]]'s words in his February 26, 1860, [[Cooper Union Address]] ("Let us have faith that right makes might, and in that faith, let us, to the end, dare to do our duty as we understand it") in his attempt to defend a policy of neutral engagement with those who practised slavery, perhaps to appear more nationally oriented and religiously convicted in hopes of winning the presidential election later that year (which he did).

The idea, though not the wording, has been attributed to the ''[[History of the Peloponnesian War]]'' by the ancient [[Ancient Greece|Greek]] historian [[Thucydides]], who stated that "right, as the world goes, is only in question between equals in power, while the strong do what they can and the weak suffer what they must."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mtholyoke.edu/acad/intrel/melian.htm|title=The Melian Dialogue|author=|date=|website=www.mtholyoke.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[William Pepperell Montague|Montague]] coined the term ''Kratocracy'', from the Greek κρατερός ''krateros'', meaning "strong", for government by those who are strong enough to seize power through force or cunning.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;

In a letter to [[Albert Einstein]] from 1932, [[Sigmund Freud]] clearly explores this idea of "might versus right" as well. He discusses the relationship between the two and how this concept has in fact existed throughout time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.freud.org.uk/file-uploads/files/WHY%20WAR.pdf|title=Freud 1968, p. 83.|author=|date=|website=freud.org.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the first chapter of Plato's ''[[The Republic (Plato)|The Republic]]'', [[Thrasymachus]] claims that "justice is nothing else than the interest of the stronger", which [[Socrates]] then disputes.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=http://classics.mit.edu/Plato/republic.2.i.html|title=Plato's Republic, Book 1|author=Plato}}&lt;/ref&gt;

"Might makes right" has been described as the [[credo]] of [[totalitarian]] regimes.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=http://heinonlinebackup.com/hol-cgi-bin/get_pdf.cgi?handle=hein.journals/valr59&amp;section=19|title=Evolution of Reasoned Elaboration: Jurisprudential Criticism and Social Change, The|author=GE White|publisher=Va. L. Rev.|year=1973}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Realism (international relations)|Realist]] scholars of [[international politics]] think of it as a game in a kind of "[[state of nature]]" in which might makes right.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=http://jcr.sagepub.com/cgi/reprint/26/1/161.pdf|title=Understanding Rummel|author=JL Ray|publisher=Journal of Conflict Resolution|year=1982}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==References in literature==
The author [[T.H. White]] covered this topic extensively in the [[Arthurian]] novel ''[[The Once and Future King]]''. [[Merlin]] teaches young Arthur to challenge this concept; Arthur, after assuming the throne, attempts to reduce violence through various means and with varying degrees of success.

'''Mindfulness-based cognitive therapy''' ('''MBCT''') is an approach to [[psychotherapy]] that uses [[cognitive behavioral therapy]] (CBT) methods in collaboration with [[mindfulness meditation|mindfulness]] meditative practices and similar psychological strategies. It was originally created to be a [[relapse]]-prevention treatment for individuals with [[major depressive disorder]] (MDD).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Theories of Counseling and Psychotherapy|last=Seligman &amp; Reichenberg|first=Linda &amp; Lourie|publisher=Pearson Prentice Hall|year=2014|isbn=9788120349094|location=New Jersey|pages=354-356}}&lt;/ref&gt; Focus on MDD and cognitive processes{{Vague|date=November 2018}} distinguish MBCT from other mindfulness-based therapies. [[Mindfulness-based stress reduction]] (MBSR), for example, is a more generalized program that also utilizes the practice of mindfulness.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hayes|first=Steven C.|last2=Villatte|first2=Matthieu|last3=Levin|first3=Michael|last4=Hildebrandt|first4=Mikaela|date=2011-01-01|title=Open, Aware, and Active: Contextual Approaches as an Emerging Trend in the Behavioral and Cognitive Therapies|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1146/annurev-clinpsy-032210-104449|journal=Annual Review of Clinical Psychology|volume=7|issue=1|pages=141–168|doi=10.1146/annurev-clinpsy-032210-104449|pmid=21219193}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One example would be "decentering", a focus on becoming aware of all incoming thoughts and feelings and accepting them, but not attaching or reacting to them.&lt;ref name="sciencedirect"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Hofmann | first1 = S.

Like CBT, MBCT functions on the [[Etiology|etiological]] theory that when individuals who have historically had depression become distressed, they return to automatic cognitive processes that can trigger a depressive episode.&lt;ref name="Felder"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Felder | first1 = J. N. | last2 = Dimidjian | first2 = S. | last3 = Segal | first3 = Z. | year = 2012 | title = Collaboration in Mindfulness-Based Cognitive Therapy | url = | journal = Journal of Clinical Psychology | volume = 68 | issue = 2| pages = 179–186 | doi=10.1002/jclp.21832}}&lt;/ref&gt; The goal of MBCT is to interrupt these automatic processes and teach the participants to focus less on reacting to incoming stimuli, and instead accepting and observing them without judgment.&lt;ref name="Felder" /&gt; Like [[Mindfulness-based stress reduction|MBSR]], this mindfulness practice encourages the participant to notice when automatic processes are occurring and to alter their reaction to be more of a reflection. It is theorized that this aspect of MBCT is responsible for the observed clinical outcomes.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Beyond the use of MBCT to reduce depressive symptoms, research additionally supports the effectiveness of mindfulness meditation in reducing cravings for individuals with substance abuse issues.  Addiction is known to involve interference with the [[prefrontal cortex]] that ordinarily allows for delaying of immediate gratification for longer term benefits by the limbic and paralimbic brain regions. The nucleus accumbens, together with the ventral tegmental area, constitutes the central link in the&amp;nbsp;reward circuit. The nucleus accumbens is also one of the brain structures that is most closely involved in drug dependency. Mindfulness meditation of smokers over a two-week period totaling five hours of meditation decreased smoking by about 60% and reduced their cravings, even for those smokers in the experiment who had no prior intentions to quit. [[Neuroimaging]] of those who practice mindfulness meditation reveals increased activity in the prefrontal cortex, a sign of greater self-control.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.psychologicalscience.org/index.php/publications/observer/2014/january-14/breaking-bad-habits.html Merluzzi, A. (2014).  Breaking Bad Habits.  APS Observer.  27, 1.]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
In 1991 Philip Barnard and [[John D. Teasdale|John Teasdale]] created a multilevel [[concept]] of the mind called "Interacting Cognitive Subsystems" (ICS). The ICS model is based on Barnard and Teasdale's concept that the mind has multiple modes that are responsible for receiving and processing new information cognitively and emotionally. Barnard and Teasdale's (1991) concept associates an individual's vulnerability to depression with the degree to which he/she relies on only one of the modes of mind, inadvertently blocking the other modes.&lt;ref name="HerbertJames_a"&gt;Herbert, James D., and Evan M. Forman. ''Acceptance and Mindfulness in Cognitive Behavior Therapy: Understanding and Applying New Theories''. Hoboken: John Wiley &amp; Sons, 2011. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;  The two main modes of mind include the "doing" mode and "being" mode.  The "doing" mode is also known as the driven mode. This mode is very goal-oriented and is triggered when the mind develops a discrepancy between how things are versus how the mind wishes things to be.&lt;ref&gt;Segal, Z., Teasdale, J., Williams, M. (2002). ''Mindfulness-Based Cognitive Therapy for Depression''. New York: Guilford Press.&lt;/ref&gt; The second main mode of mind is the "being" mode. "Being" mode, is not focused on achieving specific goals, instead the emphasis is on "accepting and allowing what is," without any immediate pressure to change it.&lt;ref&gt;Segal, Z., Teasdale, J., Williams, M. (2002). ''Mindfulness-Based Cognitive Therapy for Depression''. New York: Guilford Press. p.73&lt;/ref&gt; The central component of Barnard and Teasdale's ICS is metacognitive awareness. Metacognitive awareness is the ability to experience [[Automatic negative thoughts|negative thoughts]] and feelings as mental events that pass through the mind, rather than as a part of the self.&lt;ref name="HerbertJames"&gt;Herbert, James D., and Evan M. Forman. ''Acceptance and Mindfulness in Cognitive Behavior Therapy: Understanding and Applying New Theories''. Hoboken: John Wiley &amp; Sons, 2011. Print.p.62&lt;/ref&gt; Individuals with high metacognitive awareness are able to avoid depression and negative thought patterns more easily during stressful life situations, in comparison to individuals with low metacognitive awareness.&lt;ref name="HerbertJames" /&gt; Metacognitive awareness is regularly reflected through an individual's ability to decenter. Decentering is the ability to perceive thoughts and feelings as both impermanent and objective occurrences in the mind.&lt;ref name="HerbertJames_a" /&gt;

Based on Barnard and Teasdale's (1991) model, mental health is related to an individual's ability to disengage from one mode or to easily move among the modes of mind. Therefore, individuals that are able to flexibly move between the modes of mind based on the conditions in the environment are in the most favorable state. The ICS model theorizes that the "being" mode is the most likely mode of mind that will lead to lasting emotional changes. Therefore, for prevention of relapse in depression, cognitive therapy must promote this mode. This led Teasdale to the creation of MBCT, which promotes the "being" mode.&lt;ref name="HerbertJames_a" /&gt;

This therapy was also created by [[Zindel Segal]] and [[J. Mark G. Williams|Mark Williams]], and was partially based on the [[mindfulness-based stress reduction]] program, developed by [[Jon Kabat-Zinn]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mbct.com|title=Your Guide to Mindfulness-Based Cognitive Therapy|website=www.mbct.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Theories behind these mindfulness-based approaches to psychological issues function on the idea that being aware of things in the present, and not focusing on the past or the future, will allow the client to be more apt to deal with current stressors and distressing feelings with a flexible and accepting mindset, rather than avoiding, and, therefore, prolonging them.&lt;ref name="sciencedirect" /&gt;

==Applications==
The MBCT program is a group intervention that lasts eight weeks. During these eight weeks, there is a weekly course, which lasts two hours, and one day-long class after the fifth week. However, much of the practice is done outside of classes, where the participant uses [[guided meditation]]s and attempts to cultivate mindfulness in their daily lives.&lt;ref name="Felder" /&gt;

MBCT prioritizes learning how to pay attention or concentrate with purpose, in each moment and most importantly, without judgment.&lt;ref name="fulton_etal_2005"&gt;Fulton, P., Germer, C., Siegel, R. (2005). ''Mindfulness and  Psychotherapy.'' New York: Guilford Press.&lt;/ref&gt;  Through mindfulness, clients can recognize that holding onto some of these feelings is ineffective and mentally destructive. Mindfulness is also thought by Fulton et al. to be useful for the therapists as well during therapy sessions.&lt;ref&gt;Fulton, Germer, Siegel, 2005, p.18&lt;/ref&gt;

MBCT is an intervention program developed to specifically target vulnerability to depressive relapse.Throughout the program, patients learn mind management skills leading to heightened metacognitive awareness, acceptance of negative thought patterns and an ability to respond in skillful ways. During MBCT patients learn to decenter their negative thoughts and feelings, allowing the mind to move from an automatic thought pattern to conscious emotional processing.&lt;ref name="HerbertJames_a" /&gt; MBCT can be used as an alternative to maintenance [[antidepressant]] treatment, though it may be no more effective.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kuyken|first=Willem|last2=Hayes|first2=Rachel|last3=Barrett|first3=Barbara|last4=Byng|first4=Richard|last5=Dalgleish|first5=Tim|last6=Kessler|first6=David|last7=Lewis|first7=Glyn|last8=Watkins|first8=Edward|last9=Brejcha|first9=Claire|title=Effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of mindfulness-based cognitive therapy compared with maintenance antidepressant treatment in the prevention of depressive relapse or recurrence (PREVENT): a randomised controlled trial|url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0140673614622224|journal=The Lancet|volume=386|issue=9988|pages=63–73|doi=10.1016/s0140-6736(14)62222-4}}{{open access}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although the primary purpose of MBCT is to prevent relapse in depressive symptomology, clinicians have been formulating ways in which MBCT can be used to treat physical symptoms of other diseases such as diabetes, cancer, etc. &lt;ref name="sciencedirect.com"&gt;{{cite journal|url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0272735816302963|title=Mechanisms of action in mindfulness-based cognitive therapy (MBCT) and mindfulness-based stress reduction (MBSR) in people with physical and/or psychological conditions: A systematic review|date=1 July 2017|publisher=|journal=Clinical Psychology Review|volume=55|pages=74–91|doi=10.1016/j.cpr.2017.04.008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Clinicians are also discovering ways to use MBCT to treat the anxiety and weariness associated with these diseases. &lt;ref name="sciencedirect.com"/&gt;

== Evaluation of effectiveness ==
A meta-analysis by Jacob Piet and Esben Hougaard of the University of Aarhus, Denmark Research found that MBCT could be a viable option for individuals with [[major depressive disorder]] (MDD) in preventing a relapse.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Piet|first1=J.|last2=Hougaard|first2=E.|year=2011|title=The Effect of Mindfulness-Based Cognitive Therapy for Prevention of Relapse in Recurrent Major Depressive Disorder: a Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis|url=|journal=Clinical Psychology Review|volume=31|issue=6|pages=1032–1040|doi=10.1016/j.cpr.2011.05.002}}&lt;/ref&gt; Various studies have shown that it is most effective with individuals who have a history of at least three or more past episodes of MDD.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/14651858.CD008705.pub2/abstract |title='Third wave' cognitive and behavioural therapies versus treatment as usual for depression |last=Churchill |first=Rachel |last2=Moore |first2=Theresa HM |last3=Furukawa |first3=Toshi A |last4=Caldwell |first4=Deborah M |last5=Davies |first5=Philippa |last6=Jones |first6=Hannah |last7=Shinohara |first7=Kiyomi |last8=Imai |first8=Hissei |last9=Lewis |first9=Glyn |date=2013-10-18 |publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons |issn=1465-1858 |language=en |doi=10.1002/14651858.cd008705.pub2}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Kuyken|first1=Willem|last2=Warren|first2=Fiona C.|last3=Taylor|first3=Rod S.|last4=Whalley|first4=Ben|last5=Crane|first5=Catherine|last6=Bondolfi|first6=Guido|last7=Hayes|first7=Rachel|last8=Huijbers|first8=Marloes|last9=Ma|first9=Helen|date=27 April 2016|title=Efficacy of Mindfulness-Based Cognitive Therapy in Prevention of Depressive Relapse|journal=JAMA Psychiatry|volume=73|page=565|doi=10.1001/jamapsychiatry.2016.0076|last10=Schweizer|first10=Susanne|last11=Segal|first11=Zindel|last12=Speckens|first12=Anne|last13=Teasdale|first13=John D.|last14=Van Heeringen|first14=Kees|last15=Williams|first15=Mark|last16=Byford|first16=Sarah|last17=Byng|first17=Richard|last18=Dalgleish|first18=Tim}}&lt;/ref&gt; Within that population, participants with life-event triggered depressive episodes were least receptive to MBCT.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; According to a 2017 meta analysis, mindfulness-based interventions support the decrease in depressive and anxious symptoms in addition to overall level of patient stress. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Noordali|first=Farhan|last2=Cumming|first2=Jennifer|last3=Thompson|first3=Janice L|date=2015-12-30|title=Effectiveness of Mindfulness-based interventions on physiological and psychological complications in adults with diabetes: A systematic review|url=http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/1359105315620293|journal=Journal of Health Psychology|language=en|volume=22|issue=8|pages=965–983|doi=10.1177/1359105315620293}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

A mindfulness program based on MBCT offered by the Tees, Esk, and Wear Valleys NHS Foundation Trust, showed that measures of psychological distress, risk of burnout, self-compassion, anxiety, worry, mental well-being, and compassion to others all showed significant improvements after completing the program. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last= Hodgson | first= Russell | last2= Morgan Graham | first2= Elinor | last3= McGough | first3= Amanda L | title= Improving the well‐being of staff through mindfulness at the Tees, Esk, and Wear Valleys NHS Foundation Trust | url= https://doi.org/10.1002/joe.21874 | journal= Global Business &amp; Organizational Excellence | language=en | volume=37 | issue=5 | pages= 29-38 | doi= 10.1002/joe.21874 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Research supports that MBCT results in increased self-reported mindfulness which suggests increased present-moment awareness, decentering, and acceptance, in addition to decreased maladaptive cognitive processes such as judgment, reactivity, rumination, and thought suppression.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Results of a 2017 meta-analysis highlight the importance of home practice and its relation to conducive outcomes for mindfulness-based interventions. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Parsons|first=Christine E.|last2=Crane|first2=Catherine|last3=Parsons|first3=Liam J.|last4=Fjorback|first4=Lone Overby|last5=Kuyken|first5=Willem|title=Home practice in Mindfulness-Based Cognitive Therapy and Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction: A systematic review and meta-analysis of participants' mindfulness practice and its association with outcomes|url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0005796717300979|journal=Behaviour Research and Therapy|volume=95|pages=29–41|doi=10.1016/j.brat.2017.05.004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In some schools of Indian religions, ''moksha'' is considered equivalent to and used interchangeably with other terms such as ''vimoksha'', ''vimukti'', ''kaivalya'', ''apavarga'', ''mukti'', ''nihsreyasa'' and ''[[nirvana]]''.&lt;ref&gt;The Soka Gakkai Dictionary of Buddhism: "Vimoksha [解脱]" (Skt.; Jpn. ''gedatsu''). Emancipation, release, or liberation. The Sanskrit words vimukti, mukti, and ''moksha'' also have the same meaning. ''Vimoksha'' means release from the bonds of earthly desires, delusion, suffering, and transmigration. While Buddhism sets forth various kinds and stages of emancipation, or enlightenment, the supreme emancipation is nirvana, a state of perfect quietude, freedom, and deliverance. See [http://www.sgilibrary.org/search_dict.php?id=2602 ''The Soka Gakkai Dictionary of Buddhism'', ''vimoksha''] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140222011614/http://www.sgilibrary.org/search_dict.php?id=2602 |date=22 February 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, terms such as ''moksha'' and ''nirvana'' differ and mean different states between various schools of Hinduism, Buddhism and Jainism.&lt;ref name=dltc&gt;See:

== Etymology ==

''Moksha'' is derived from the root {{lang-sa|मुच्}}, ''{{IAST|muc}}'', which means free, let go, release, liberate.&lt;ref name=mmw&gt;[http://www.ibiblio.org/sripedia/ebooks/mw/0800/mw__0853.html मुच] Monier-Williams Sanskrit English Dictionary, Germany (2008)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Sten Rohde, Deliver us from Evil: studies on the Vedic ideas of salvation, Ejnar Munksgaard, Copenhagen, pp 25-35&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Veda]]s and early [[Upanishad]]s, the word {{lang-sa|मुच्यते}}, ''{{IAST|mucyate}}''&lt;ref name=mmw/&gt; appears, which means to be set free or release, such as of a horse from its harness.

The definition and meaning of ''moksha'' varies between various schools of Indian religions.&lt;ref&gt;M. Hiriyanna (2000), The essentials of Indian philosophy, {{ISBN|978-8120813304}}, pp 50-52&lt;/ref&gt; ''Moksha'' means freedom, liberation; from what and how is where the schools differ.&lt;ref name=danielingalls/&gt; ''Moksha'' is also a concept that means liberation from rebirth or ''[[saṃsāra]]''.{{sfn|Sharma|2000|p=113}} This liberation can be attained while one is on earth (''jivanmukti''), or [[Eschatology|eschatologically]] (''karmamukti'',{{sfn|Sharma|2000|p=113}} ''[[Videha mukti|videhamukti]]''). Some Indian traditions have emphasized liberation on concrete, ethical action within the world. This liberation is an [[epistemology|epistemological]] transformation that permits one to see the truth and reality behind the fog of ignorance.&lt;ref group=web name="Brittanica" /&gt;

''Moksha'' has been defined not merely as absence of suffering and release from bondage to ''saṃsāra'', various schools of Hinduism also explain the concept as presence of the state of ''paripurna-brahmanubhava'' (the experience of oneness with [[Brahman]], the One Supreme Self), a state of knowledge, peace and bliss.&lt;ref&gt;see:

{{Quote|
1=&lt;poem&gt;

&lt;poem&gt;
Beyond caste, creed, family or lineage,
That which is without name and form, beyond merit and demerit,
That which is beyond space, time and sense-objects,
You are that, God himself; Meditate this within yourself. ||Verse 254||
&lt;/poem&gt;
| 2=Vivekachudamani|3=8th Century AD&lt;ref&gt;Many verses from Vivekachudamani expound on “Tat tvam asi” phrase such as the verse above. For other verses, and translation, see:

}}

Moksha has been defined in the book ''Sulightenment by Fathor''&lt;ref name="Fathor"&gt;{{cite book|last=Brain Mechanic|first=Fathor|title=Sunlightenment: Science of Universe|year=2018|url=https://www.amazon.com/Sunlightenment-Science-Universe-Fathor-ebook/dp/B07KX3X393/}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Moksha is the State of Universe that having the liberation from the physical aspect. You liberate from the material aspects of life that you are in.''

=== Eschatological sense ===

''Moksha'' is a concept associated with ''saṃsāra'' (birth-rebirth cycle). ''Samsara'' originated with religious movements in the first millennium BCE.&lt;ref group=web name="Brittanica"/&gt; These movements such as Buddhism, Jainism and new schools within Hinduism, saw human life as bondage to a repeated process of rebirth. This bondage to repeated rebirth and life, each life subject to injury, disease and aging, was seen as a cycle of suffering. By release from this cycle, the [[suffering]] involved in this cycle also ended. This release was called ''moksha'', ''[[nirvana]]'', ''[[kaivalya]]'', ''mukti'' and other terms in various Indian religious traditions.&lt;ref&gt;R.C. Mishra, Moksha and the Hindu Worldview, Psychology &amp; Developing Societies, Vol. 25, Issue 1, pp 23, 27&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Eschatology|Eschatological]] ideas evolved in Hinduism.&lt;ref&gt;N. Ross Reat (1990), The Origins of Indian Psychology, {{ISBN|0-89581-924-4}}, Asian Humanities Press, Chapter 2&lt;/ref&gt; In earliest Vedic literature, heaven and hell sufficed [[soteriology|soteriological]] curiosities. Over time, the ancient scholars observed that people vary in the quality of virtuous or sinful life they lead, and began questioning how differences in each person's ''[[Punya (Hinduism)|puṇya]]'' (merit, good deeds) or ''pāp'' (demerit, sin) as human beings affected their afterlife.&lt;ref&gt;See:
* Simon Brodbeck (2011), Sanskrit Epics: The Ramayana, Mahabharata and Harivamsa, in Jessica Frazier (Editor) - The Continuum Companion to Hindu Studies, {{ISBN|978-0-8264-9966-0}}, pp 83-100
* J. A. B. Van Buitenen, Dharma and Moksa, Philosophy East and West, Vol. 7, No. 1/2 (Apr. - Jul., 1957), pp. 33-40&lt;/ref&gt; This question led to the conception of an afterlife where the person stayed in heaven or hell, in proportion to their merit or demerit, then returned to earth and were reborn, the cycle continuing indefinitely. The rebirth idea ultimately flowered into the ideas of ''saṃsāra'', or transmigration - where one's balance sheet of ''[[karma]]'' determined one's rebirth. Along with this idea of ''saṃsāra'', the ancient scholars developed the concept of ''moksha'', as a state that released a person from the ''saṃsāra'' cycle. ''Moksha'' release in eschatological sense in these ancient literature of Hinduism, suggests [[J. A. B. van Buitenen|van Buitenen]],&lt;ref name=jabvb&gt;J. A. B. Van Buitenen, Dharma and Moksa, Philosophy East and West, Vol. 7, No. 1/2 (Apr. - Jul., 1957), pp. 33-40&lt;/ref&gt; comes from self-knowledge and consciousness of oneness of supreme soul.

=== Epistemological and psychological senses ===

Scholars provide various explanations of the meaning of ''moksha'' in epistemological and psychological senses. For example, Deutsche sees ''moksha'' as transcendental consciousness, the perfect state of being, of self-realization, of freedom and of "realizing the whole universe as the Self".&lt;ref&gt;E. Deutsch, The self in Advaita Vedanta, in Roy Perrett (Editor), Indian philosophy: metaphysics, Volume 3, {{ISBN|0-8153-3608-X}}, Taylor and Francis, pp 343-360&lt;/ref&gt;

''Moksha'' in Hinduism, suggests [[Klaus Klostermaier]],&lt;ref name=klausklost&gt;Klaus Klostermaier, Mokṣa and Critical Theory, Philosophy East and West, Vol. 35, No. 1 (Jan., 1985), pp. 61-71&lt;/ref&gt; implies a setting-free of hitherto fettered faculties, a removing of obstacles to an unrestricted life, permitting a person to be more truly a person in the full sense; the concept presumes an unused human potential of creativity, compassion and understanding which had been blocked and shut out. ''Moksha'' is more than liberation from a life-rebirth cycle of suffering (''samsara''); the Vedantic school separates this into two: ''jivanmukti'' (liberation in this life) and ''videhamukti'' (liberation after death).&lt;ref&gt;see:
* M. von Brück (1986), Imitation or Identification?, Indian Theological Studies, Vol. 23, Issue 2, pp 95-105
* Klaus Klostermaier, Mokṣa and Critical Theory, Philosophy East and West, Vol. 35, No. 1 (Jan., 1985), pp. 61-71&lt;/ref&gt; ''Moksha'' in this life includes psychological liberation from ''adhyasa'' (fears besetting one's life) and ''avidya'' (ignorance or anything that is not true knowledge).&lt;ref name=klausklost/&gt;

==== As a state of perfection ====

[[File:Gajendra Moksha print.jpg|thumb|220px|[[Gajendra Moksha]] (pictured) is a symbolic tale in [[Vaishnavism]]. The elephant Gajendra enters a lake where a crocodile (Huhu) clutches his leg and becomes his suffering. Despite his pain, Gajendra constantly remembers Vishnu, who then liberates him. Gajendra symbolically represents human beings, Huhu represents sins, and the lake is saṃsāra.]]
Many schools of Hinduism according to [[Daniel H. H. Ingalls, Sr.|Daniel Ingalls]],&lt;ref name=danielingalls/&gt; see ''moksha'' as a state of perfection. The concept was seen as a natural goal beyond ''dharma''. ''Moksha'', in the epics and ancient literature of Hinduism, is seen as achievable by the same techniques necessary to practice ''dharma''. Self-discipline is the path to ''dharma'', ''moksha'' is self-discipline that is so perfect that it becomes unconscious, second nature. ''Dharma'' is thus a means to ''moksha''.&lt;ref&gt;see:
* Karl Potter, Dharma and Mokṣa from a Conversational Point of View, Philosophy East and West, Vol. 8, No. 1/2 (Apr. - Jul., 1958), pp. 49-63
* Daniel H. H. Ingalls, Dharma and Moksha, Philosophy East and West, Vol. 7, No. 1/2 (Apr. - Jul., 1957), pp. 41-48&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Samkhya]] school of Hinduism, for example, suggests that one of the paths to ''moksha'' is to magnify one's ''[[sattva]]m''.&lt;ref&gt;One of three qualities or habits of an individual; sattvam represents spiritual purity; sattvic people, claims Samkhya school, are those who see world's welfare as a spiritual principle. See cited Ingalls reference.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=dhhi45&gt;Daniel H. H. Ingalls, Dharma and Moksha, Philosophy East and West, Vol. 7, No. 1/2 (Apr. - Jul., 1957), pp. 45-46&lt;/ref&gt; To magnify one's ''sattvam'', one must develop oneself where one's ''sattvam'' becomes one's instinctive nature. Many schools of Hinduism thus understood ''dharma'' and ''moksha'' as two points of a single journey of life, a journey for which the ''[[viaticum]]'' was discipline and self-training.&lt;ref name=dhhi45/&gt; Over time, these ideas about ''moksha'' were challenged.

==== Nagarjuna's challenge ====

''Dharma'' and ''moksha'', suggested [[Nagarjuna]] in the 2nd century, cannot be goals on the same journey.&lt;ref name=dhhi46&gt;Daniel H. H. Ingalls, Dharma and Moksha, Philosophy East and West, Vol. 7, No. 1/2 (Apr. - Jul., 1957), pp. 46&lt;/ref&gt; He pointed to the differences between the world we live in, and the freedom implied in the concept of ''moksha''. They are so different that ''dharma'' and ''moksha'' could not be intellectually related. ''Dharma'' requires worldly thought, ''moksha'' is unworldly understanding, a state of bliss. How can the worldly thought-process lead to unworldly understanding? asked Nagarjuna.&lt;ref name=dhhi46/&gt; Karl Potter explains the answer to this challenge as one of context and framework, the emergence of broader general principles of understanding from thought processes that are limited in one framework.&lt;ref&gt;Karl Potter, Dharma and Mokṣa from a Conversational Point of View, Philosophy East and West, Vol. 8, No. 1/2 (Apr. - Jul., 1958), pp. 49-63&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Adi Shankara's challenge ====

[[Adi Shankara]] in the 8th century AD, like Nagarjuna earlier, examined the difference between the world one lives in and ''moksha'', a state of freedom and release one hopes for.&lt;ref name=dhhi47&gt;Daniel H. H. Ingalls, Dharma and Moksha, Philosophy East and West, Vol. 7, No. 1/2 (Apr. - Jul., 1957), pp. 47&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike Nagarjuna, Shankara considers the characteristics between the two. The world one lives in requires action as well as thought; our world, he suggests, is impossible without ''vyavahara'' (action and plurality). The world is interconnected, one object works on another, input is transformed into output, change is continuous and everywhere. ''Moksha'', suggests Shankara,&lt;ref name=klausklost/&gt; is that final perfect, blissful state where there can be no change, where there can be no plurality of states. It has to be a state of thought and consciousness that excludes action.&lt;ref name=dhhi47/&gt; How can action-oriented techniques by which we attain the first three goals of man (''kama'', ''artha'' and ''dharma'') be useful to attain the last goal, namely ''moksha''?

Scholars&lt;ref&gt;see:
* Daniel H. H. Ingalls, Dharma and Moksha, Philosophy East and West, Vol. 7, No. 1/2 (Apr. - Jul., 1957), pp 41-48
* R Sinari (1982), The concept of human estrangement in plotinism and Shankara Vedanta, in "Neoplatonism and Indian thought", Ed: R.B. Harris, Albany, NY, pp 243-255
* R.K. Tripathi (1982), Advaita Vedanta and Neoplatonism, in "Neoplatonism and Indian thought", Ed: R.B. Harris, Albany, NY, pp 237; also see pp 294-297 by Albert Wolters&lt;/ref&gt; suggest Shankara's challenge to the concept of ''moksha'' parallels those of [[Plotinus]] against the Gnostics, with one important difference:&lt;ref name=dhhi47/&gt; Plotinus accused the Gnostics of exchanging an anthropocentric set of virtues with a theocentric set in pursuit of salvation; Shankara challenged that the concept of ''moksha'' implied an exchange of anthropocentric set of virtues (''dharma'') with a blissful state that has no need for values. Shankara goes on to suggest that anthropocentric virtues suffice.

==== The Vaisnavas' challenge ====

[[Vaishnavism]], one of the ''[[Bhakti yoga|bhakti]]'' schools of Hinduism, is devoted to the worship of God, sings his name, anoints his image or idol, and has many sub-schools. Vaishnavas (followers of Vaishnavism) suggest that ''dharma'' and ''moksha'' cannot be two different or sequential goals or states of life.&lt;ref name=dhhi48&gt;
Daniel H. H. Ingalls, "Dharma and Moksha", ''Philosophy East and West'', Vol. 7, No. 1/2 (Apr. - Jul., 1957), pp. 48
&lt;/ref&gt;
Instead, they suggest God should be kept in mind constantly to simultaneously achieve ''dharma'' and ''moksha'', so constantly that one comes to feel one cannot live without God's loving presence. This school emphasized love and adoration of God as the path to "moksha" (salvation and release), rather than works and knowledge. Their focus became divine virtues, rather than anthropocentric virtues. [[Daniel H. H. Ingalls, Sr.|Daniel Ingalls]]&lt;ref name=dhhi48/&gt; regards Vaishnavas' position on ''moksha'' as similar to the Christian position on salvation, and Vaishnavism as the school whose views on ''dharma'', ''karma'' and ''moksha'' dominated the initial impressions and colonial-era literature on Hinduism, through the works of Thibaut, [[Max Müller]] and others.

== History ==

The concept of ''moksha'' appears much later in ancient Indian literature than the concept of ''dharma''. The proto-concept that first appears in the ancient Sanskrit verses and early Upanishads is ''mucyate'', which means freed or released. It is the middle and later Upanishads, such as the [[Shvetashvatara Upanishad|Svetasvatara]] and [[Maitrayaniya Upanishad|Maitri]], where the word ''moksha'' appears and begins becoming an important concept.&lt;ref name=danielingalls/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;see:
* Klaus Klostermaier (1985), Mokṣa and Critical Theory, Philosophy East and West, 35 (1), pp 61-71

[[Katha Upanishad|Kathaka Upanishad]],&lt;ref&gt;Sometimes called Katha Upanishad - for example, by Max Muller, Nakhilananda&lt;/ref&gt; a middle Upanishadic era script dated to be about 2500 years old, is among the earliest expositions about ''saṃsāra'' and ''moksha''. In Book I, Section III, the legend of boy Naciketa queries [[Yama]], the lord of death to explain what causes ''saṃsāra'' and what leads to liberation.&lt;ref&gt;[[Paul Deussen]], Sixty Upanishads of the Veda, Vol 1, {{ISBN|978-0842616454}}, pp 269-290&lt;/ref&gt; Naciketa inquires: what causes sorrow? Yama explains that suffering and ''saṃsāra'' results from a life that is lived absent-mindedly, with impurity, with neither the use of intelligence nor self-examination, where neither mind nor senses are guided by one's ''[[Ātman (Hinduism)|atma]]'' (soul, self).&lt;ref name=oxfordatmandef&gt;'''[a]''' [http://www.oxforddictionaries.com/us/definition/american_english/atman Atman], Oxford Dictionaries, Oxford University Press (2012), '''Quote''': "1. real self of the individual; 2. a person's soul";&lt;br&gt;'''[b]''' John Bowker (2000), The Concise Oxford Dictionary of World Religions, Oxford University Press, {{ISBN|978-0192800947}}, See entry for Atman;&lt;br&gt;'''[c]''' WJ Johnson (2009), A Dictionary of Hinduism, Oxford University Press, {{ISBN|978-0198610250}}, See entry for Atman (self).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=3defsatman&gt;'''[a]''' David Lorenzen (2004), The Hindu World (Editors: Sushil Mittal and Gene Thursby), Routledge, {{ISBN|0-415215277}}, pages 208-209, '''Quote''': "Advaita and nirguni movements, on the other hand, stress an interior mysticism in which the devotee seeks to discover the identity of individual soul (atman) with the universal ground of being (brahman) or to find god within himself".;&lt;br&gt;'''[b]''' Richard King (1995), Early Advaita Vedanta and Buddhism, State University of New York Press, {{ISBN|978-0791425138}}, page 64, '''Quote:''' "Atman as the innermost essence or soul of man, and Brahman as the innermost essence and support of the universe. (...) Thus we can see in the Upanishads, a tendency towards a convergence of microcosm and macrocosm, culminating in the equating of atman with Brahman".&lt;br&gt;'''[c]''' Chad Meister (2010), The Oxford Handbook of Religious Diversity, Oxford University Press, {{ISBN|978-0195340136}}, page 63; '''Quote''': "Even though Buddhism explicitly rejected the Hindu ideas of ''Atman'' (soul) and Brahman, Hinduism treats Sakyamuni Buddha as one of the ten avatars of Vishnu."&lt;/ref&gt; Liberation comes from a life lived with inner purity, alert mind, led by ''buddhi'' (reason, intelligence), realization of the Supreme Self (''purusha'') who dwells in all beings. Kathaka Upanishad asserts knowledge liberates, knowledge is freedom.&lt;ref&gt;Paul Deussen, Sixty Upanishads of the Veda, Vol 1, {{ISBN|978-0842616454}}, pp 283-289&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;S. Nikhilananda, The Principal Upanishads, Dover Publications, {{ISBN|978-0486427171}}, pp 63-84&lt;/ref&gt; Kathaka Upanishad also explains the role of yoga in personal liberation, ''moksha''.

[[Svetasvatara Upanishad]], another middle era Upanishad written after Kathaka Upanishad, begins with questions such as why is man born, what is the primal cause behind the universe, what causes joy and sorrow in life?&lt;ref&gt;Paul Deussen, Sixty Upanishads of the Veda, Vol 1, {{ISBN|978-0842616454}}, pp 301-326&lt;/ref&gt; It then examines the various theories, that were then existing, about saṃsāra and release from bondage. Svetasvatara claims&lt;ref&gt;Paul Deussen, Sixty Upanishads of the Veda, Vol 1, {{ISBN|978-0842616454}}, pp 316, 319-325&lt;/ref&gt; bondage results from ignorance, illusion or delusion; deliverance comes from knowledge. The Supreme Being dwells in every being, he is the primal cause, he is the eternal law, he is the essence of everything, he is nature, he is not a separate entity. Liberation comes to those who know Supreme Being is present as the Universal Spirit and Principle, just as they know butter is present in milk. Such realization, claims Svetasvatara, come from self-knowledge and self-discipline; and this knowledge and realization is liberation from transmigration, the final goal of the Upanishad.&lt;ref&gt;Paul Deussen, Sixty Upanishads of the Veda, Vol 1, {{ISBN|978-0842616454}}, pp 305-306, 322-325&lt;/ref&gt;

Starting with the middle Upanishad era, ''moksha'' - or equivalent terms such as ''mukti'' and ''kaivalya'' - is a major theme in many [[Upanishad]]s. For example, Sarasvati Rahasya Upanishad, one of several Upanishads of the [[Bhakti yoga|bhakti school]] of Hinduism, starts out with prayers to Goddess Sarasvati. She is the Hindu goddess of knowledge, learning and creative arts;&lt;ref name=jbrl/&gt; her name is a compound word of ‘‘sara’’&lt;ref&gt;[http://spokensanskrit.de/index.php?tinput=sAra&amp;direction=SE&amp;script=HK&amp;link=yes&amp;beginning=0 सार] Sanskrit English Dictionary, Germany&lt;/ref&gt; and ‘‘sva’’,&lt;ref&gt;[http://spokensanskrit.de/index.php?tinput=sva&amp;direction=SE&amp;script=HK&amp;link=yes&amp;beginning=0 स्व] Sanskrit English Dictionary, Germany&lt;/ref&gt; meaning "essence of self". After the prayer verses, the Upanishad inquires about the secret to freedom and liberation (mukti). Sarasvati's reply in the Upanishad is:
{{Quote|
1=&lt;poem&gt;
It was through me the Creator himself gained liberating knowledge,
I am being, consciousness, bliss, eternal freedom: unsullied, unlimited, unending.
My perfect consciousness shines your world, like a beautiful face in a soiled mirror,
Seeing that reflection I wish myself you, an individual soul, as if I could be finite!

A finite soul, an infinite Goddess - these are false concepts,
in the minds of those unacquainted with truth,
No space, my loving devotee, exists between your self and my self,
Know this and you are free. This is the secret wisdom.
&lt;/poem&gt;

=== Evolution of the concept ===

The concept of ''moksha'', according to [[Daniel H. H. Ingalls, Sr.|Daniel Ingalls]],&lt;ref name=danielingalls/&gt; represented one of many expansions in Hindu Vedic ideas of life and afterlife. In the Vedas, there were three [[Ashrama (stage)|stages]] of life: studentship, householdship and retirement. During the Upanishadic era, Hinduism expanded this to include a fourth stage of life: [[Sannyasa|complete abandonment]]. In Vedic literature, there are three modes of experience: waking, dream and deep sleep. The Upanishadic era expanded it to include ''turiyam'' - the stage beyond deep sleep. The Vedas suggest three goals of man: [[kama]], [[artha]] and [[dharma]]. To these, the Upanishadic era added ''moksha''.&lt;ref name=danielingalls&gt;Daniel H. H. Ingalls, Dharma and Moksha, Philosophy East and West, Vol. 7, No. 1/2 (Apr. - Jul., 1957), pp. 41-48&lt;/ref&gt;

The acceptance of the concept of ''moksha'' in some schools of [[Hindu philosophy]] was slow. These refused to recognize ''moksha'' for centuries, considering it irrelevant.&lt;ref name=danielingalls/&gt; The Mimamsa school, for example, denied the goal and relevance of ''moksha'' well into the 8th century AD, until the arrival of a Mimamsa scholar named [[Kumarila]].&lt;ref&gt;see:
* M. Hiriyanna (1952), [[:iarchive:Mysore.Hiriyanna-The.Quest.After.Perfection|The Quest After Perfection]], Kavyalaya Publishers, pp 23-33
* John Taber, The significance of Kumarila’s Philosophy, in Roy Perrett (Ed) - Theory of Value, Vol 5, {{ISBN|978-0815336129}} pp. 113-161
* Okita, K. (2008), Mīmāṃsā and Vedānta: Interaction and Continuity, The Journal of Hindu Studies, 1(1-2), pp 155-156&lt;/ref&gt; Instead of ''moksha'', Mimamsa school of Hinduism considered the concept of heaven as sufficient to answer the question: what lay beyond this world after death. Other schools of Hinduism, over time, accepted the ''moksha'' concept and refined it over time.&lt;ref name=danielingalls/&gt;

It is unclear when the core ideas of samsara and ''moksha'' were developed in ancient India. Patrick Olivelle suggests these ideas likely originated with new religious movements in the first millennium BCE.&lt;ref group=web name="Brittanica"&gt;[[Patrick Olivelle]] (2012), Encyclopædia Britannica, [http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/387852/moksha ''Moksha (Indian religions)'']&lt;/ref&gt; ''Mukti'' and ''moksha'' ideas, suggests [[J. A. B. van Buitenen]],&lt;ref name=jabvb/&gt; seem traceable to yogis in Hinduism, with long hair, who chose to live on the fringes of society, given to self-induced states of intoxication and ecstasy, possibly accepted as medicine men and "sadhus" by the ancient Indian society.&lt;ref name=danielingalls/&gt; ''Moksha'' to these early concept developers, was the abandonment of the established order, not in favor of anarchy, but in favor of self-realization, to achieve release from this world.&lt;ref&gt;J.A.B. van Buitenen, in Roy Perrett (Editor) - Theory of Value, Volume 5, {{ISBN|0-8153-3612-8}}, Taylor &amp; Francis, pp 25-32&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Silhouette yoga.png|thumb|220px|Mokṣa is a key concept in [[Yoga]], where it is a state of “awakening”, liberation and freedom in this life.&lt;ref&gt;see:
* Mircea Eliade (1958, Reprinted: 2009), Yoga: Immortality and Freedom, Princeton University Press, {{ISBN|978-0691142036}}, pp 33-34;
* Sarah Strauss (2005), Positioning Yoga, Berg/Oxford International, {{ISBN|1-85973-739-0}}, pp 15&lt;/ref&gt;]]

In its historical development, the concept of ''moksha'' appears in three forms: Vedic, yogic and bhakti. In the Vedic period, ''moksha'' was ritualistic.&lt;ref name=jabvb/&gt; Mokṣa was claimed to result from properly completed rituals such as those before ''Agni'' - the fire deity. The significance of these rituals was to reproduce and recite the cosmic creation event described in the Vedas; the description of knowledge on different levels - ''adhilokam'', ''adhibhutam'', ''adhiyajnam'', ''adhyatmam'' - helped the individual transcend to moksa. Knowledge was the means, the ritual its application. By the middle to late Upanishadic period, the emphasis shifted to knowledge, and ritual activities were considered irrelevant to the attainment of ''moksha''.&lt;ref name=amalinar&gt;Angelika Malinar (2011), in Jessica Frazier (Editor), The Bloomsbury companion to Hindu studies, {{ISBN|978-1-4725-1151-5}}, Chapter 4&lt;/ref&gt; [[Yoga|Yogic]] ''moksha''&lt;ref name=jabvb/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Knut Jacobson, in Jessica Frazier (Editor), Continuum companion to Hindu studies, {{ISBN|978-0-8264-9966-0}}, pp 74-82&lt;/ref&gt; replaced Vedic rituals with personal development and meditation, with hierarchical creation of the ultimate knowledge in self as the path to ''moksha''. Yogic ''moksha'' principles were accepted in many other schools of Hinduism, albeit with differences. For example, [[Adi Shankara]] in his book on ''moksha'' suggests:

==Synonyms==

The words ''moksha'', nirvana (''nibbana'') and [[kaivalya]] are sometimes used synonymously,&lt;ref&gt;For example, the Adhyatma Upanishad uses all three words nirvana, kaivalya and ''moksha'' (Verses 12, 16, 69, 70); K.N. Aiyar (Transl. 1914), [[:iarchive:thirtyminorupani00xxxxuoft|Thirty Minor Upanishads]], University of Toronto Robart Library Archives, Canada, pp 55-60&lt;/ref&gt; because they all refer to the state that liberates a person from all causes of sorrow and suffering.&lt;ref&gt;A.

Kaivalya, a concept akin to ''moksha'', rather than nirvana, is found in some schools of Hinduism such as the Yoga school. Kaivalya is the realization of aloofness with liberating knowledge of one's self and union with the spiritual universe. For example, [[Patanjali]]’s Yoga Sutra suggests:
{{Quote|
1=&lt;poem&gt;
तस्य हेतुरविद्या,
तदभावात्संयोगाभावो हानं तद् दृशेः कैवल्यम् |

After the dissolution of avidya (ignorance),
comes removal of communion with material world,

Nirvana and ''moksha'', in all traditions, represents a state of being in ultimate reality and perfection, but described in a very different way. Some scholars, states Jayatilleke, assert that the Nirvana of Buddhism is same as the [[Brahman]] in Hinduism, a view other scholars and he disagree with.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=K.N.

== Hinduism ==

Ancient literature of different schools of Hinduism sometimes use different phrases for ''moksha''. For example, ''Keval jnana'' or ''[[kaivalya]]'' ("state of Absolute"), ''Apavarga'', ''Nihsreyasa'', ''Paramapada'', ''Brahmabhava'', ''Brahmajnana'' and ''[[Brahmi sthiti]]''. Modern literature additionally uses the Buddhist term nirvana interchangeably with ''moksha'' of Hinduism.&lt;ref name=pjaini/&gt;&lt;ref name=davidloy/&gt; There is difference between these ideas, as explained elsewhere in this article, but they are all [[soteriology|soteriological]] concepts of various Indian religious traditions.

The six major orthodox schools of Hinduism have had a historic debate, and disagree over whether ''moksha'' can be achieved in this life, or only after this life.&lt;ref name=asharma&gt;A. Sharma (2000), Classical Hindu Thought: An Introduction, Oxford University Press, {{ISBN|978-0195644418}}, pp 117&lt;/ref&gt; Many of the 108 Upanishads discuss amongst other things ''moksha''. These discussions show the differences between the schools of Hinduism, a lack of consensus, with a few attempting to conflate the contrasting perspectives between various schools.&lt;ref&gt;[[Paul Deussen]], Sixty Upanishads of the Veda, Vol 1, {{ISBN|978-81-208-1468-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, freedom and deliverance from birth-rebirth, argues Maitrayana Upanishad, comes neither from the Vedanta school's doctrine (the knowledge of one's own Self as the Supreme Soul) nor from the Samkhya school's doctrine (distinction of the Purusha from what one is not), but from Vedic studies, observance of the ''Svadharma'' (personal duties), sticking to ''Asramas'' (stages of life).&lt;ref&gt;Paul Deussen, Sixty Upanishads of the Veda, Vol 1, {{ISBN|978-81-208-1468-4}}, pp 342&lt;/ref&gt;

The six major orthodox schools of Hindu philosophy offer the following views on ''moksha'', each for their own reasons: the Nyaya, Vaisesika and Mimamsa schools of Hinduism consider ''moksha'' as possible only after death.&lt;ref name=asharma/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Note: Each school has a different meaning for ''moksha''. For example, Mimamsa school considers ''moksha'' as release into ''svarga'' (heaven), it does not recognize samsara; while Nyaya school considers ''moksha'' as linked to samsara and a release from it; See: [[:iarchive:mimamsasutra00jaimuoft|The Purva-Mimamsa Sutra of Jaimini]], Transl: M.L. Sandal (1923), Chapter II, Pada I and Chapter VI, Pada I through VIII; Also see Klaus Klostermaier, A Survey of Hinduism, 3rd Edition, {{ISBN|978-0-7914-7082-4}}, Chapter 26&lt;/ref&gt; Samkhya and Yoga schools consider ''moksha'' as possible in this life. In Vedanta school, the Advaita sub-school concludes ''moksha'' is possible in this life,&lt;ref name=asharma/&gt; while Dvaita and Visistadvaita sub-schools of Vedanta tradition believes that ''moksha'' is a continuous event, one assisted by loving devotion to God, that extends from this life to post-mortem. Beyond these six orthodox schools, some heterodox schools of Hindu tradition, such as Carvaka, deny there is a soul or after life ''moksha''.&lt;ref&gt;see:

=== Sāmkhya, Yoga and mokṣa ===

Both Sāmkhya and Yoga systems of religious thought are ''mokshaśāstras'', suggests [[:no:Knut A. Jacobsen|Knut Jacobsen]], they are systems of salvific liberation and release.&lt;ref name=kjacobson&gt;Knut Jacobson, in Jessica Frazier (Editor), Continuum companion to Hindu studies, {{ISBN|978-0-8264-9966-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sāmkhya is a system of interpretation, primarily a theory about the world. Yoga is both a theory and a practice. Yoga gained wide acceptance in ancient India, its ideas and practices became part of many religious schools in Hinduism, including those that were very different from Sāmkhya. The eight limbs of yoga can be interpreted as a way to liberation (''moksha'').&lt;ref name=kjacobson/&gt;&lt;ref name=kjjf/&gt;

In Sāmkhya literature, liberation is commonly referred to as ''kaivalya''. In this school, kaivalya means the realization of ''purusa'', the principle of consciousness, as independent from mind and body, as different from ''prakrti''. Like many schools of Hinduism, in Sāmkhya and Yoga schools, the emphasis is on the attainment of knowledge, ''vidyā'' or ''jñāna'', as necessary for salvific liberation, ''moksha''.&lt;ref name=kjacobson/&gt;&lt;ref name=jgold&gt;Jeffrey Gold, Plato in the Light of Yoga, Philosophy East and West, Vol. 46, No. 1 (Jan., 1996), pp. 20-27&lt;/ref&gt; Yoga's purpose is then seen as a means to remove the ''avidyā'' - that is, ignorance or misleading/incorrect knowledge about one self and the universe. It seeks to end ordinary reflexive awareness (''cittavrtti nirodhah'') with deeper, purer and holistic awareness (''asamprājñāta samādhi'').&lt;ref name=kjjf&gt;Knut Jacobsen (2011), in Jessica Frazier (Editor), The Bloomsbury companion to Hindu studies, {{ISBN|978-1-4725-1151-5}}, pp 74-82&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;R. Sinari, The way toward Moksa, in Murty et al. (Editors) - Freedom, Progress &amp; Society, {{ISBN|81-208-0262-4}}, pp 45-60&lt;/ref&gt; Yoga, during the pursuit of ''moksha'', encourages practice (''abhyāsa'') with detachment (''vairāgya''), which over time leads to deep concentration (''samādhi''). Detachment means withdrawal from outer world and calming of mind, while practice means the application of effort over time. Such steps are claimed by Yoga school as leading to samādhi, a state of deep awareness, release and bliss called ''kaivalya''.&lt;ref name=kjacobson/&gt;&lt;ref name=jgold/&gt;

The second mārga is [[Bhakti Yoga]], the way of loving devotion to God. The third mārga is [[Karma Yoga]], the way of works.

Negendra (2008), Int Journal of Yoga, Jul-Dec, 1(2), pp 43–44&lt;/ref&gt; For example, the Advaita Vedanta school relies on Jñāna Yoga in its teachings of ''moksha''.&lt;ref name=edav&gt;Eliot Deutsch, Advaita Vedanta: A philosophical reconstruction, University of Hawaii Press, {{ISBN|978-0824802714}}, pp 104-106&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Vedanta and mokṣa ===
{{Main article|Vedanta}}
The three main sub-schools in Vedanta school of Hinduism - [[Advaita Vedanta]], [[Vishistadvaita]] and [[Dvaita]] - each have their own views about ''moksha''.

The Vedantic school of Hinduism suggests the first step towards mokṣa begins with ''mumuksutva'', that is desire of liberation.&lt;ref name=klausklost/&gt; This takes the form of questions about self, what is true, why do things or events make us happy or cause suffering, and so on. This longing for liberating knowledge is assisted by, claims [[Adi Shankara]] of Advaita Vedanta,&lt;ref&gt;Shankara, Sarva vedanta siddhantasara 230-239&lt;/ref&gt; [[guru]] (teacher), study of historical knowledge and [[viveka]] (critical thinking). Shankara cautions that the guru and historic knowledge may be distorted, so traditions and historical assumptions must be questioned by the individual seeking ''moksha''. Those who are on their path to ''moksha'' (samnyasin), suggests [[Klaus Klostermaier]], are quintessentially free individuals, without craving for anything in the worldly life, thus are neither dominated by, nor dominating anyone else.&lt;ref name=klausklost/&gt;

[[Vivekachudamani]], which literally means "Crown Jewel of Discriminatory Reasoning", is a book devoted to moksa in Vedanta philosophy. It explains what behaviors and pursuits lead to ''moksha'', as well what actions and assumptions hinder ''moksha''. The four essential conditions, according to Vivekachudamani, before one can commence on the path of ''moksha'' include (1) ''vivekah'' (discrimination, critical reasoning) between everlasting principles and fleeting world; (2) ''viragah'' (indifference, lack of craving) for material rewards; (3) ''samah'' (calmness of mind), and (4) ''damah'' (self restraint, [[Temperance (virtue)|temperance]]).&lt;ref&gt;D. Datta  (1888), Moksha, or the Vedántic Release, Journal of the Royal Asiatic Society of Great Britain and Ireland, New Series, Vol. 20, No. 4 (Oct., 1888), pp. 516&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Brahmasutrabhasya'' adds to the above four requirements, the following: ''uparati'' (lack of bias, dispassion), ''titiksa'' (endurance, patience), ''sraddha'' (faith) and ''[[samadhana]]'' (intentness, commitment).&lt;ref name=edav/&gt;

The [[Advaita Vedanta|Advaita]] tradition considers ''moksha'' achievable by removing [[Avidya (Hinduism)|avidya]] (ignorance). ''Moksha'' is seen as a final release from illusion, and through knowledge (''[[Anubhava (Hindu thought)|anubhava]]'') of one's own fundamental nature, which is [[Satcitananda]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Brodd | first = Jefferey | title = World Religions | publisher = Saint Mary's Press | year = 2003 | location = Winona, MN | pages = | url = | doi =  | isbn = 978-0-88489-725-5 }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{refn|group=note|The description comprises the three [[Sanskrit]] words ''sat-chit-ananda'':

The knowledge of Brahman leads to ''moksha'',&lt;ref&gt;Anantanand Rambachan, [https://books.google.com/books?id=b9EJBQG3zqUC&amp;pg=PA124&amp;dq=brahma+as+opposed+to+brahman&amp;lr=#PPA124,M1 ''The limits of scripture: Vivekananda's reinterpretation of the Vedas''] University of Hawaii Press, 1994, pages 124-125&lt;/ref&gt; where Brahman is described as that which is the origin and end of all things, the universal principle behind and at source of everything that exists, consciousness that pervades everything and everyone.&lt;ref&gt;Karl Potter (2008), The Encyclopedia of Indian Philosophies: Advaita Vedānta Up to Śaṃkara and His Pupils, Volume 3, Delhi: Motilal Banarsidass, pp 210-215&lt;/ref&gt; Advaita Vedanta emphasizes [[Jnana Yoga]] as the means of achieving ''moksha''.&lt;ref name=edav/&gt; Bliss, claims this school, is the fruit of knowledge (vidya) and work (karma).&lt;ref&gt;Karl Potter (2008), The Encyclopedia of Indian Philosophies: Advaita Vedānta Up to Śaṃkara and His Pupils, Volume 3, Delhi: Motilal Banarsidass, pp 213&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Dvaita]] (dualism) traditions define ''moksha'' as the loving, eternal union with God ([[Vishnu]]) and considered the highest perfection of existence. Dvaita schools suggest every soul encounters liberation differently.&lt;ref&gt;Betty, Stafford. "Dvaita, Advaita, And Viśiṣṭadvaita: Contrasting Views Of Mokṣa." Asian Philosophy 20.2 (2010): 215-224. Academic Search Elite. Web. 24 Sept. 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; Dualist schools (e.g. [[Vaishnava]]) see God as the object of love, for example, a personified monotheistic conception of [[Shiva]] or [[Vishnu]]. By immersing oneself in the love of God, one's [[karma]]s slough off, one's illusions decay, and truth is lived.  Both the worshiped and worshiper gradually lose their illusory sense of separation and only One beyond all names remains. This is salvation to dualist schools of Hinduism. Dvaita Vedanta emphasizes [[Bhakti Yoga]] as the means of achieving ''moksha''.&lt;ref&gt;N.S.S. Raman (2009), Ethics in Bhakti Philosophical Literature, in R. Prasad - A Historical-developmental Study of Classical Indian Philosophy of Morals, {{ISBN|978-8180695957}}, Chapter 19&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Vishistadvaita]] tradition, led by [[Ramanuja]], defines avidya and ''moksha'' differently from the Advaita tradition. To Ramanuja, avidya is a focus on the self, and vidya is a focus on a loving god. The Vishistadvaita school argues that other schools of Hinduism create a false sense of agency in individuals, which makes the individual think oneself as potential or self-realized god. Such ideas, claims Ramanuja, decay to materialism, hedonism and self worship. Individuals forget ''Ishvara'' (God). Mukti, to Vishistadvaita school, is release from such avidya, towards the intuition and eternal union with God ([[Vishnu]]).&lt;ref&gt;Abha Singh (October 2001), Social Philosophy of Ramanuja: its modern relevance, ''Indian Philosophical Quarterly'', Vol. 28, No. 4, pp 491–498&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Mokṣa in this life ===

Among the Samkhya, Yoga and Vedanta schools of Hinduism, liberation and freedom reached within one's life is referred to as ''jivanmukti'', and the individual who has experienced this state is called ''[[jivanmukta]]'' (self-realized person).&lt;ref&gt;see:

* he is humble, high-spirited, of clear and steady mind, straightforward, compassionate, patient, indifferent, courageous, speaks firmly and with sweet words.

When a Jivanmukta dies he achieves Paramukti and becomes a Paramukta. Jivanmukta experience enlightenment and liberation while alive and also after death i.e., after becoming paramukta, while Videhmukta experiences enlightenment and liberation only after death.

=== Mokṣa in Balinese Hinduism ===

Balinese Hinduism incorporates ''moksha'' as one of five [[Tattva|tattwas]]. The other four are: ''brahman'' (the one supreme god head, not to be confused with Brahmin), ''atma'' (soul or spirit), [[karma]] (actions and reciprocity, causality), ''samsara'' (principle of rebirth, reincarnation). ''Moksha'', in Balinese Hindu belief, is the possibility of unity with the divine; it is sometimes referred to as nirwana.&lt;ref&gt;Balinese Hindus spell words slightly differently from Indian Hindus; tattva in India is spelled tattwa in Bali, nirvana in India is spelled nirwana in Bali, etc.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=anettheim&gt;Anna Nettheim (2011), [http://unsworks.unsw.edu.au/fapi/datastream/unsworks:10091/SOURCE02 Tattwa are the words of the world: Balinese narratives and creative transformation], Ph.D. Thesis, University of New South Wales, Australia&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Main article|Nirvana|Rebirth (Buddhism)}}

In [[Buddhism]] the term "moksha" is uncommon, but an equivalent term is ''vimutti'', "release". In the suttas two forms of release are mentioned, namely ''ceto-vimutti'', "deliverance of mind," and ''panna-vimutti'', "deliverance through wisdom" (insight). ''Ceto-vimutti''  is related to the practice of dhyana, while ''panna-vimutti'' is related to the development of insight. According to Gombrich, the distinction may be a later development, which resulted in a change of doctrine, regarding the practice of [[Dhyana in Buddhism|dhyana]] to be insufficient for final liberation.&lt;ref&gt;Gombrich, ''The Conditioned genesis of Buddhism'', chapter four: "How Insight Worstened Concentration"&lt;/ref&gt;

With release comes Nirvana (Pali: Nibbana), “blowing out”, "quenching", or “becoming extinguished” of the fires of the passions and of self-view.&lt;ref name="Collins2010p63"&gt;{{cite book|author=Steven Collins |title=Nirvana: Concept, Imagery, Narrative |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=d5pshUYiUVwC |year=2010|publisher=Cambridge University Press |isbn=978-0-521-88198-2 |pages=63–64, 33–34, 47–50, 74–75, 106 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Gombrich, "What the Buddha thought"&lt;/ref&gt; It is a "timeless state" in which there is no more [[Samsara|becoming]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Steven Collins |title=Nirvana: Concept, Imagery, Narrative |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=d5pshUYiUVwC |year=2010|publisher=Cambridge University Press |isbn=978-0-521-88198-2 |page=31}}, '''Quote:''' "This general scheme remained basic to later Hinduism, to Jainism, and to Buddhism.

The ultimate aim is the timeless state of ''moksha'', or as the Buddhists seem to have been the first to call it, nirvana."&lt;/ref&gt;

Nirvana ends the cycle of ''[[Dukkha]]'' and rebirth in the six realms of [[Saṃsāra (Buddhism)]].&lt;ref name="Gethin1998p74"/&gt;&lt;!--** START OF NOTE ("NIRODHA") **--&gt;{{refn|group=note|name="Nirodha"|Ending rebirth:&lt;br&gt;* Graham Harvey: "The Third Noble Truth is nirvana.

{{Main article|Moksha (Jainism)}}
In [[Jainism]], ''moksha'' and ''nirvana'' are one and the same.&lt;ref name=pjaini&gt;{{cite book | last =Jaini | first =Padmanabh | title =Collected Papers on Jaina Studies | publisher =Motilal Banarsidass Publ. | year =2000 | location =Delhi | isbn =81-208-1691-9 }}: ''"Moksa and Nirvana are synonymous in Jainism".'' p.168&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Michael Carrithers, Caroline Humphrey (1991) ''The Assembly of listeners: Jains in society'' Cambridge University Press. {{ISBN|0521365058}}: ''"Nirvana: A synonym for liberation, release, moksa."'' p.297&lt;/ref&gt; Jaina texts sometimes use the term ''Kevalya'', and call the liberated soul as ''Kevalin''.&lt;ref name=pauldundastjp104/&gt; As with all Indian religions, ''moksha'' is the ultimate spiritual goal in Jainism. It defines ''moksha'' as the spiritual release from all karma.&lt;ref name=pauldundastjp104&gt;{{cite book|author= Paul Dundas|title=The Jains |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=X8iAAgAAQBAJ |year=2003|publisher= Routledge|isbn=978-0415266055 |pages= 104–105 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Jainism is a [[Sramana|Sramanic]] non-theistic philosophy, that like Hinduism and unlike Buddhism, believes in a metaphysical permanent self or [[soul]] often termed ''[[Jīva (Jainism)|jiva]]''. Jaina believe that this soul is what transmigrates from one being to another at the time of death. The ''moksa'' state is attained when a soul (''[[Ātman (Jainism)|atman]]'') is liberated from the cycles of deaths and rebirths (''[[Saṃsāra (Jainism)|saṃsāra]]''), is at the apex, is omniscient, remains there eternally, and is known as a ''[[siddha]]''.{{Sfn|Padmanabh Jaini|1980|pp=222-223}} In Jainism, it is believed to be a stage beyond enlightenment and ethical perfection, states [[Paul Dundas]], because they can perform physical and mental activities such as teach, without accruing karma that leads to rebirth.&lt;ref name=pauldundastjp104/&gt;

Jaina traditions believe that there exist ''Abhavya'' (incapable), or a class of souls that can never attain ''moksha'' (liberation).{{Sfn|Padmanabh Jaini|1980|p=226}}&lt;ref name=pauldundastjp104/&gt; The ''Abhavya'' state of soul is entered after an intentional and shockingly evil act,{{Sfn|Padmanabh Jaini|1980|p=225}} but Jaina texts also polemically applied ''Abhavya'' condition to those who belonged to a competing ancient Indian tradition called ''[[Ājīvika]]''.&lt;ref name=pauldundastjp104/&gt; A male human being is considered closest to the apex of ''moksha'', with the potential to achieve liberation, particularly through asceticism. The ability of women to attain ''moksha'' has been historically debated, and the subtraditions with Jainism have disagreed. In the [[Digambara]] tradition of Jainism, women must live an ethical life and gain karmic merit to be reborn as a man, because only males can achieve spiritual liberation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Jeffery D Long|title=Jainism: An Introduction|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ajAEBAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT36|year=2013|publisher=I.B.Tauris|isbn=978-0-85773-656-7|pages=36–37}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=harveyp182&gt;{{cite book|author=Graham Harvey |title=Religions in Focus: New Approaches to Tradition and Contemporary Practices |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=wrTsCwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT182|year=2016|publisher=Routledge |isbn=978-1-134-93690-8|pages=182–183}}&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast, the [[Śvētāmbara]] tradition has believed that women too can attain ''moksha'' just like men.&lt;ref name=harveyp182/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author= Paul Dundas|title=The Jains |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=X8iAAgAAQBAJ |year=2003|publisher= Routledge|isbn=978-0415266055 |pages= 55–59 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Padmanabh S.

== Sikhism ==
The [[Sikh]] concept of mukti (''moksha'') is similar to other Indian religions, and refers to spiritual liberation.&lt;ref name=teece17/&gt; It is described in Sikhism as the state that breaks the cycle of rebirths.&lt;ref name=teece17&gt;Geoff Teece (2004), Sikhism: Religion in focus, {{ISBN|978-1-58340-469-0}}, page 17&lt;/ref&gt; Mukti is obtained according to Sikhism, states Singha, through "God's grace".&lt;ref name=hssingha54&gt;HS Singha (2009),Sikhism: A Complete Introduction, Hemkunt Press, {{ISBN|978-8170102458}}, pages 53-54&lt;/ref&gt; According to the [[Guru Granth Sahib]], the devotion to God is viewed as more important than the desire for ''Mukti''.&lt;ref name=hssingha54/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="13393">The notion of '''non-malleable codes''' was introduced in 2010 by Dziembowski, Pietrzak, and Wichs,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Dziembowski|first=Stefan|last2=Pietrzak|first2=Krzysztof|last3=Wichs|first3=Daniel|date=2009-01-01|title=Non-Malleable Codes|url=https://eprint.iacr.org/2009/608}}&lt;/ref&gt; for relaxing the notion of [[Error correction and detection|error-correction and error-detection]]. Informally, a code is non-malleable if the message contained in a modified [[code-word]] is either the original message, or a completely unrelated value. Non-malleable codes provide a useful and meaningful security guarantee in situations where traditional [[Error correction and detection|error-correction and error-detection]] is impossible; for example, when the [[Hacker (computer security)|attacker]] can completely overwrite the encoded message. Although such codes do not exist if the family of "[[Tampering (crime)|tampering]] functions" F is completely unrestricted, they are known to exist for many broad tampering families F.

== Background Knowledge ==

=== Tampering Experiment ===
To know the operation schema of non-malleable code, we have to have a knowledge of the basic experiment it based on. The following is the three step method of [[Tampering with evidence|tampering]] experiment.
# A ''source message'' &lt;math&gt;s&lt;/math&gt; is [[Encode/Decode|encoded]] via a (possibly randomized) procedure &lt;math&gt;Enc&lt;/math&gt;, yielding a ''[[code-word]] &lt;math&gt;c&lt;/math&gt;'' = &lt;math&gt;Enc(s)&lt;/math&gt;.
# The code-word is modified under some ''tampering-function'' &lt;math&gt;f\in F&lt;/math&gt; to an erroneous-code-word &lt;math&gt;c^*&lt;/math&gt;=&lt;math&gt;f(c)&lt;/math&gt;.
# The erroneous-code-word &lt;math&gt;c^*&lt;/math&gt; is decoded using a procedure &lt;math&gt; Dec &lt;/math&gt;, resulting in a decoded-message  &lt;math&gt;s^*&lt;/math&gt;= &lt;math&gt;Dec(c^*)&lt;/math&gt;.

The tampering experiment can be used to model several interesting real-world settings, such as data transmitted over a [[Noisy channel model|noisy channel]], or adversarial tampering of data stored in the memory of a physical device. Having this experimental base, we would like to build special encoding/decoding procedures &lt;math&gt;(Enc,Dec)&lt;/math&gt;, which give us some meaningful guarantees about the results of the above tampering experiment, for large and interesting families &lt;math&gt;F&lt;/math&gt; of tampering functions. The following are several possibilities for the type of guarantees that we may hope for.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Faust|first1=Sebastian|last2=Mukherjee|first2=Pratyay|last3=Venturi|first3=Daniele|last4=Wichs|first4=Daniel|title=Efficient Non-Malleable Codes and Key-Derivation for Poly-Size Tampering Circuits|journal=Advances in Cryptology – EUROCRYPT 2014|volume= 8441|pages=111–128|url=http://infoscience.epfl.ch/record/198993/files/Efficient_Non-Malleable_Codes.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Error correction ===
One very natural guarantee, called [[Error detection and correction|error-correction]], would be to require that for any tampering function and any ''source-message s'', the tampering experiment always produces the correct decoded message  &lt;math&gt;s^* = s&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = Communication theory of secrecy systems|last = E. Shannon|first = Claude|date = 1949|journal = Bell System Technical Journal|doi = |pmid = |access-date = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Error detection ===
A weaker guarantee, called [[Error detection and correction|error-detection]], requires that the tampering-experiment always results in either the correct value &lt;math&gt;s^* = s&lt;/math&gt; or a special symbol &lt;math&gt;s^* = \perp &lt;/math&gt; indicating that tampering has been detected. This notion of error-detection is a weaker guarantee than error-correction, and achievable for larger F of tampering functions.

== Algorithm description==
A non-malleable code ensures that either the tampering experiment results in a correct decoded-message  &lt;math&gt;s^* = s&lt;/math&gt;, or the decoded-message &lt;math&gt;s^*&lt;/math&gt; is completely independent of and unrelated to the ''source-message'' &lt;math&gt;s&lt;/math&gt;. In other word, the notion of non-malleability for codes is similar, in spirit, to notions of non-malleability for cryptographic primitives (such as encryption2, commitments and zero-knowledge proofs), introduced by the seminal work of Dolev, Dwork and Naor.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Dolev|first1=Danny|last2=Dwork|first2=Cynthia|last3=Moni|first3=Naor|title=Non-Malleable Cryptography|journal=SIAM Journal on Computing|date=Mar 24, 2000|page=http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download;jsessionid=9A853A59C3A45DD1B67690F10232D635?doi=10.1.1.26.8267&amp;rep=rep1&amp;type=pdf|doi=10.1137/s0097539795291562}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Compared to [[Error correction and detection|error correction or error detection]], the "right" formalization of non-malleable codes is somewhat harder to define. Let &lt;math&gt;Tamper^f_s&lt;/math&gt; be a random variable for the value of the decoded-message, which results when we run the tampering experiment with source-message &lt;math&gt;s&lt;/math&gt; and tampering-function &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt;, over the randomness of the encoding procedure. Intuitively, we wish to say that the distribution of &lt;math&gt;Tamper^f_s&lt;/math&gt; is independent of the encoded message &lt;math&gt;s&lt;/math&gt;. Of course, we also want to allow for the case where the tampering experiment results in &lt;math&gt;s^* = s&lt;/math&gt; (for example, if the tampering function is identity), which clearly depends on &lt;math&gt;s&lt;/math&gt;.

Thus, we require that for every tampering-function &lt;math&gt;f\in F&lt;/math&gt;, there exists a [[Distribution (mathematics)|distribution]] &lt;math&gt;D_f&lt;/math&gt; which outputs either concrete values &lt;math&gt;s^*&lt;/math&gt; or a special same &lt;math&gt;*&lt;/math&gt; symbol, and faithfully models the distribution of &lt;math&gt;Tamper^f_s&lt;/math&gt; for all &lt;math&gt;s&lt;/math&gt; in the following sense: for every source message &lt;math&gt;s&lt;/math&gt;, the distributions of &lt;math&gt;Tamper^f_s&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;D_f&lt;/math&gt; are statistically close when the &lt;math&gt;*&lt;/math&gt; symbol is interpreted as &lt;math&gt;s&lt;/math&gt;. That is, &lt;math&gt;D_f&lt;/math&gt; correctly simulates the "outcome" of the tampering-experiment with a function &lt;math&gt;f\in F&lt;/math&gt; without knowing the source-messages &lt;math&gt;s&lt;/math&gt;, but it is allowed some ambiguity by outputting a same &lt;math&gt;*&lt;/math&gt; symbol to indicate that the decoded-message should be the same as the source-message, without specifying what the exact value is. The fact that &lt;math&gt;D_f&lt;/math&gt; depends on only &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; and not on &lt;math&gt;s&lt;/math&gt;, shows that the outcome of &lt;math&gt;Tamper^f_s&lt;/math&gt; is independent of &lt;math&gt;s&lt;/math&gt;, exempting equality.

== Relation to error correction/detection ==
Notice that [[Ductility|non-malleability]] is a weaker guarantee than error correction/detection; the latter ensure that any change in the code-word can be corrected or at least detected by the decoding procedure, whereas the former does allow the message to be modified, but only to an unrelated value. However, when studying [[Error detection and correction|error correction/detection]] we usually restrict ourselves to limited forms of tampering which preserve some notion of distance (e.g., usually [[hamming distance]]) between the original and tampered code-word. 
For example, it is already impossible to achieve error correction/detection for the simple family of functions &lt;math&gt;F_{const}&lt;/math&gt; which, for every constant &lt;math&gt;c^*&lt;/math&gt;, includes a "[[Mathematical constant|constant]]" function &lt;math&gt;f_{c^*}&lt;/math&gt; that maps all inputs to &lt;math&gt;c^*&lt;/math&gt;. There is always some function in &lt;math&gt;F_{const}&lt;/math&gt; that maps everything to a valid code-word &lt;math&gt;c^*&lt;/math&gt;. In contrast, it is trivial to construct codes that are non-malleable w.r.t &lt;math&gt;F_{const}&lt;/math&gt;, as the output of a constant function is clearly independent of its input. The prior works on non-malleable codes show that one can construct non-malleable codes for highly complex tampering function families &lt;math&gt;F&lt;/math&gt; for which error correction/detection can not be achievable.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Dziembowski|first1=Stefan|last2=Pietrzak|first2=Krzysztof|last3=Wichs|first3=Daniel|title=Non-Malleable Codes|journal=ICS, 2010|url=http://eprint.iacr.org/2009/608.pdf.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Application over tampering functions ==

=== Bit-wise independent tampering ===
As one very concrete example, we study [[Non-malleable codes|non-malleability]] with respect to the family of functions &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; which specify, for each bit of the [[Code word|code-word]] &lt;math&gt;c&lt;/math&gt;, whether to keep it as is, flip it, set it to 0, set it to 1. That is, each bit of the code-word is modified arbitrarily but independently of the value of the other bits of the code-word. We call this the “bit-wise independent tampering” family &lt;math&gt;F_{BIT}&lt;/math&gt;. Note that this family contains constant functions &lt;math&gt;F_{const}&lt;/math&gt; and constant-error functions &lt;math&gt;F_{err}&lt;/math&gt; as subsets. Therefore, as we have mentioned, error-correction and error-detection cannot be achieved w.r.t. this family. Nevertheless, the following can show an efficient non-malleable code for this powerful family.

With &lt;math&gt;F_{BIT}&lt;/math&gt; we denote the family which contains all tampering functions that tamper every bit independently. Formally, this family contains all functions &lt;math&gt;f_i: \left\{{0},{1}\right\}^n \to \left\{{0},{1}\right\}^n&lt;/math&gt;  that are defined by n functions&lt;math&gt;f_i: \left\{{0},{1}\right\} \to \left\{{0},{1}\right\}&lt;/math&gt; (for i=1...n) as &lt;math&gt;f(c_1..c_n)=f_1(c_1)..f_n(c_n)&lt;/math&gt;. Note that there are only 4 possible choices for each &lt;math&gt;f_i&lt;/math&gt; (i.e. how to modify a particular bit) and we name these “set to 0”, “set to 1”, “flip”, “keep” where the meanings should be intuitive. We call the above family the bit-wise independent tampering family.

=== All families of bounded size ===
* [[Probabilistic]] Method Approach 
For any "small enough" function family &lt;math&gt;F&lt;/math&gt;, there exists a (possibly inefficient) coding scheme which is non-malleable w.r.t. F. Moreover, for a fixed "small enough" function family &lt;math&gt;F&lt;/math&gt;, a random coding scheme is likely to be non-malleable w.r.t. F with overwhelming probability. Unfortunately, random coding schemes cannot be efficiently represented, nor is the encoding/decoding function likely to be efficient. Therefore, this result should merely be thought of as showing "possibility" and providing a target that we should then strive to match constructively. Moreover, this result also highlights the difference between "error-correction/detection" and "non-malleability" since a result of this form could not be true for the former notions.
 
* [[Random oracle|Random Oracle]] Model Approach
It is not clear what the bound from the theorem&lt;ref name=":0"/&gt; of this type actually implies. For example, it does tell us that non-malleable codes exist with respect to all efficient functions, but this is misleading as we know that efficient non-malleable codes (and ultimately we are only interested in such) cannot be non-malleable w.r.t. this class. Nevertheless, the result by the probabilistic method does give us codes which are non-malleable w.r.t. very general classes of functions in the random oracle model.

=== Model of tamper-resilient security ===
In this model, we consider two ways of interacting with the system:

''Execute(''&lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;''):'' A user can provide the system with Execute(x) queries, for &lt;math&gt;x\in \left\{{0},{1}\right\}^u&lt;/math&gt;, in which case the system computes &lt;math&gt;(y,s^') \gets G(x,s)&lt;/math&gt;, updates the state of the system to &lt;math&gt;s :=s^'&lt;/math&gt; and outputs &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt;.

''Tamper(''&lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt;'')'': We also consider tampering attacks against the system, modeled by Tamper(&lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt;) commands, for functions &lt;math&gt;f: \left\{{0},{1}\right\}^n \to \left\{{0},{1}\right\}^n&lt;/math&gt;. Upon receiving such command, the system state is set to &lt;math&gt;s := f(s)&lt;/math&gt;.

An attacker that can also interact with the system via Tamper queries can potentially learn significantly more about the secret state, even recover it entirely. Therefore, we would like to have a general method for securing systems against tampering attacks, so that the ability to issue Tamper queries (at least for functions f in some large family &lt;math&gt;F&lt;/math&gt;) cannot provide the attacker with additional information. By using non-malleable code for this purpose we have the conclusion: Let &lt;math&gt;(Enc,Dec)&lt;/math&gt; be any coding scheme which is non-malleable w.r.t &lt;math&gt;F&lt;/math&gt;, then &lt;math&gt;(Enc,Dec)&lt;/math&gt; can also be tamper-simulate w.r.t. &lt;math&gt;F&lt;/math&gt;.

== Capacity of non-malleable codes ==
# For every family &lt;math&gt;F&lt;/math&gt; with &lt;math&gt;|F|\leq 2^{2^{\alpha n}}&lt;/math&gt;, there exist non-malleable codes against &lt;math&gt;F&lt;/math&gt; with rate arbitrarily close to 1 − &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt; (this is achieved w.h.p. by a randomized construction).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite arXiv|title = Capacity of Non-Malleable Codes|arxiv= 1309.0458|date = 2013-09-02|first = Mahdi|last = Cheraghchi|first2 = Venkatesan|last2 = Guruswami}}&lt;/ref&gt;
# For families of size &lt;math&gt;exp( n^{O(1)}2^{\alpha n})&lt;/math&gt; against which there is no non-malleable code of rate 1 − &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt; (in fact this is the case w.h.p for a random family of this size).
# 1 − &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt; is the best achievable rate for the family of functions which are only allowed to tamper the first &lt;math&gt;\alpha n&lt;/math&gt; bits of the code-word, which is of special interest.

{{Psychoanalysis |Concepts}}
'''Penis envy''' ({{lang-de|Penisneid}}) is a stage theorized by [[Sigmund Freud]] regarding [[female]] [[psychosexual development]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/2616954|title=Three essays on the theory of sexuality|last=1856-1939.|first=Freud, Sigmund,|date=1975|origyear=1962|publisher=Basic Books|others=Strachey, James.|isbn=0465097081|location=New York|oclc=2616954}}&lt;/ref&gt;, in which young girls experience anxiety upon realization that they do not have a [[Human penis|penis]]. Freud considered this realization a defining moment in a series of transitions toward a mature female sexuality and [[gender identity]]. In Freudian theory, the penis envy stage begins the transition from an attachment to the mother to competition with the mother for the attention, recognition and affection of the father.&lt;ref&gt;Sigmund Freud, ''New Introductory Lectures on Psychoanalysis'' (PFL 2) p. 158-163&lt;/ref&gt; The parallel reaction of a [[boy]]'s realization that women do not have a penis is [[castration anxiety]].

Freud's theories regarding psychosexual development, and in particular the ''phallic stage'', were criticized and refined by other psychoanalysts, such as [[Karen Horney]], [[Otto Fenichel]], [[Ernest Jones]], [[Erik Erikson]], [[Jean Piaget]], [[Juliet Mitchell]], and [[Clara Thompson]].

==Freud's theory==
Freud introduced his theory of the concept of interest in—and envy of—the penis in his 1908 article "On the Sexual Theories of Children":&lt;ref&gt;Sigmund Freud, ''On Sexuality'' (PFL 7) p. 195-6&lt;/ref&gt; it was not mentioned in the first edition of Freud's earlier ''[[Three Essays on the Theory of Sexuality|Three Contributions to the Theory of Sex]]'' (1905), but a synopsis of the 1908 article was added to the third edition in 1915.&lt;ref&gt;Freud, ''On Sexuality'' p. 112-4&lt;/ref&gt; In ''[[On Narcissism]]'' (1914) he described how some women develop a masculine ideal as "a survival of the boyish nature that they themselves once possessed".&lt;ref&gt;Sigmund Freud, ''On Metapsychology'' (PFL 11) p. 83-4&lt;/ref&gt; The term grew in significance as Freud gradually refined his views of sexuality, coming to describe a mental process he believed occurred as one went from the [[phallic stage]] to the [[Psychosexual development#Latency phase|latency stage]] (see [[Psychosexual development]]).&lt;ref&gt;Freud, ''On Sexuality'' p. 336-40&lt;/ref&gt;

===Psychosexual development: child===
{{unreferenced section|date=August 2012}}

In Freud's psychosexual development theory, the phallic stage (approximately between the ages of 3.5 and 6) is the first period of development in which the libidinal focus is primarily on the genital area. Prior to this stage, the [[libido]] (broadly defined by Freud as the primary motivating energy force within the mind) focuses on other physiological areas. For instance, in the ''oral stage'', in the first 12 to 18 months of life, libidinal needs concentrate on the desire to eat, sleep, suck and bite. The theory suggests that the penis becomes the organ of principal interest to ''both'' sexes in the phallic stage. This becomes the catalyst for a series of pivotal events in psychosexual development. These events, known as the [[Oedipus complex]] for boys, and the [[Electra complex]] for girls, result in significantly different outcomes for each gender because of differences in anatomy.

Freud thought girls:
* Soon after the libidinal shift to the penis, the child develops her first sexual impulses towards her mother.
* The girl realizes that she is not physically equipped to have a heterosexual relationship with her mother, since she does not have a penis.
* She desires a penis, and the power that it represents. This is described as penis envy. She sees the solution as obtaining her father's penis.
* She develops a sexual desire for her father.
* The girl blames her mother for her apparent castration (what ''she'' sees as punishment by the mother for being attracted to the father) assisting a shift in the focus of her sexual impulses from her mother to her father.
* Sexual desire for her father leads to the desire to replace and eliminate her mother.
* The girl identifies with her mother so that she might learn to mimic her, and thus replace her.
* The child anticipates that both aforementioned desires will incur punishment (by the principle of [[lex talionis]]).
* The girl employs the [[defence mechanism]] of [[Displacement (psychology)|displacement]] to shift the object of her sexual desires from her father to men in general.

A similar process occurs in boys of the same age as they pass through the phallic stage of development; the key differences being that the focus of sexual impulses need not switch from mother to father, and that the fear of castration (castration anxiety) remains. The boy desires his mother, and identifies with his father, whom he sees as having the object of his sexual impulses. Furthermore, the boy's father, being the powerful aggressor of the family unit, is sufficiently menacing that the boy employs the defense mechanism of displacement to shift the object of his sexual desires from his mother to women in general.

Freud thought this series of events occurred prior to the development of a wider sense of sexual identity, and was required for an individual to continue to enter into his or her gender role.

===Psychosexual development: adult===

Freud considered that in normal female development penis envy transformed into the wish for a man and/or a baby.&lt;ref&gt;Freud, ''On Sexuality'' p. 297-301&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Karl Abraham]] differentiated two types of adult women in whom penis envy remained intense as the wish-fulfilling and the vindictive types:&lt;ref&gt;Fenichel, p. 494-5&lt;/ref&gt; The former were dominated by fantasies of having or becoming a penis—as with the singing/dancing/performing women who felt that in their acts they magically incorporated the [parental] phallus.&lt;ref&gt;Mary Jacobus, ''The Poetics of Psychoanalysis'' (2005) p. 29-30 and p. 6&lt;/ref&gt; The latter sought revenge on the male through humiliation or deprivation (whether by removing the man from the penis or the penis from the man).&lt;ref&gt;David Cooper, ''The Death of the Family'' (1974) p. 152&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticisms of Freud's theory==

===Within psychoanalytic circles===
Freud's theories regarding psychosexual development, and in particular the ''phallic stage'', were early challenged by other psychoanalysts, such as [[Karen Horney]], Otto Fenichel and [[Ernest Jones]],&lt;ref&gt;Peter Gay, ''Freud'' (1989) p. 520-2&lt;/ref&gt; though Freud did not accept their view of penis envy as a secondary, rather than a primary, female reaction.&lt;ref&gt;Freud, ''On Sexuality'' p. 391-2&lt;/ref&gt; Later psychologists, such as [[Erik Erikson]] and [[Jean Piaget]], challenged the Freudian model of child psychological development as a whole.

[[Jacques Lacan]], however, took up and developed Freud's theory of the importance of what he called "''penisneid'' in the unconscious of women"&lt;ref&gt;Jacques Lacan, ''Écrits: A Selection'' (1997) p. 281&lt;/ref&gt; in linguistic terms, seeing what he called the phallus as the privileged signifier of humanity's subordination to language: "the phallus (by virtue of which the unconscious is language)".&lt;ref&gt;Lacan, p. 288&lt;/ref&gt; He thereby opened up a new field of debate around [[phallogocentrism]]&lt;ref&gt;J. Childers/G. Hentzi, ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=bnhNE6LrmMYC&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=snippet&amp;q=%22penis%20envy%22%20OR%20%22phallogocentrism%22&amp;f=false The Columbia Dictionary of Modern Literary and Cultural Criticism]'' (1995) p. 224-6 and p. 39-40&lt;/ref&gt;—some figures like [[Juliet Mitchell]] endorsing a view of penis envy which "uses, not the man, but the phallus to which the man has to lay claim, as its key term",&lt;ref&gt;Juliet Mitchell and [[Jacqueline Rose]], ''Feminine Sexuality'' (1982) p. 7-8&lt;/ref&gt; others strongly repudiating it.&lt;ref&gt;Jane Gallup, ''Feminism and Psychoanalysis'' (1982) p. 69 and p. 84&lt;/ref&gt;

===Feminist and sociological criticisms===
In Freud's theory, the female sexual center shifts from the [[clitoris]] to the [[vagina]] during a heterosexual life event. Freud believed in a duality between how [[gender]]s construct mature sexuality in terms of the opposite gender, whereas feminists reject the notion that female sexuality can only be defined in relation to the male. Feminists development theorists instead believe that the clitoris, not the vagina, is the mature center of female sexuality because it allows a construction of mature female sexuality independent of the penis. 

A significant number of [[Feminism|feminists]] have been highly critical of penis envy theory {{Citation needed|date=July 2018}} as a concept and psychoanalysis as a discipline, arguing that the assumptions and approaches of the psychoanalytic project are profoundly [[patriarchy|patriarchal]], anti-feminist, and [[misogynist]]ic and represent women as broken or deficient men.&lt;ref&gt;Gay, p. 520-1&lt;/ref&gt; [[Karen Horney]]—a German psychoanalyst who also placed great emphasis on childhood experiences in psychological development—was a particular advocate of this view. She asserted the concept of "[[womb envy]]", and saw "masculine [[narcissism]]"&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in Gay, p. 520&lt;/ref&gt; as underlying the mainstream Freudian view.

Some [[Feminism|feminists]]  argue that Freud's developmental theory is [[Heteronormativity|heteronormative]] and denies women a mature sexuality independent of men; they also criticize it for privileging the [[vagina]] over the [[clitoris]] as the center of [[Human female sexuality|women's sexuality]]. They criticize the sociosexual theory for privileging heterosexual [[Human sexual activity|sexual activity]] and penile penetration in defining women's "mature state of sexuality".&lt;ref&gt;Peter Gay, ''Freud'' (1989) p. 520-2&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Jane Gallup, ''Feminism and Psychoanalysis'' (1982) p. 69 and p. 84&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;R. Appiganesi/C. Garratt, ''Postmodernism for Beginners'' (1995) p. 94-101&lt;/ref&gt; Others claim that the concept explains how, in a patriarchal society, women might envy the power accorded to those with a phallus.&lt;ref&gt;Peter Gay, ''Freud'' (1989) p. 520-2&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Jane Gallup, ''Feminism and Psychoanalysis'' (1982) p. 69 and p. 84&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Elisabeth Young-Bruehl, ed., ''Freud and Women'' (1990) p. 304&lt;/ref&gt;

In her influential paper "Women and Penis Envy" (1943), [[Clara Thompson]] reformulated the latter as ''social'' envy for the trappings of the dominant gender,&lt;ref&gt;Nancy Friday, ''Women on Top'' (1991) p. 420&lt;/ref&gt; a [[Sociology|sociological]] response to female subordination under patriarchy.&lt;ref&gt;G. Legman, ''Rationale of the Dirty Joke Vol I'' (1973) p. 332-3&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Betty Friedan]] referred to penis envy as a purely parasitic social bias typical of Victorianism and particularly of Freud's own biography, and showed how the concept played a key role in discrediting alternative notions of femininity in the early to mid twentieth century: "Because Freud's followers could only see woman in the image defined by Freud – inferior, childish, helpless, with no possibility of happiness unless she adjusted to being man's passive object – they wanted to help women get rid of their suppressed envy, their neurotic desire to be equal. They wanted to help women find sexual fulfilment as women, by affirming their natural inferiority".&lt;ref&gt;Betty Friedan, The Feminine Mystique, 1963, p. 110.&lt;/ref&gt;

A small but influential number of Feminist philosophers, working in [[Psychoanalytic feminism]], and including [[Luce Irigaray]], [[Julia Kristeva]],&lt;ref&gt;R. Appiganesi/C. Garratt, ''Postmodernism for Beginners'' (1995) p. 94-101&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Hélène Cixous]], have taken varying [[post-structuralist]] views on the question, inspired or at least challenged by figures such as Jacques Lacan and [[Jacques Derrida]].&lt;ref&gt;Childers, p. 40&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Juliet Mitchell]] in her early work attempted to reconcile Freud's thoughts on psychosexual development with Feminism and Marxism by declaring his theories to be simply observations of gender identity under [[capitalism]].{{Citation needed|date=June 2012}}

'''Political philology'''  is "an active mode of understanding" texts. It does not simply take (religious) texts at face-value as religious texts without any connection to a social and political context, but situates them in a historical context, and is sensitive to the social and political implications and usages of a (religious) text.{{sfn|Pollock|2008}}

The term '''psychic apparatus''' (also '''psychical apparatus''', '''mental apparatus''') denotes a central, theoretic construct of [[Sigmund Freud|Freudian]] [[metapsychology]], wherein:

{{quote|We assume that mental life is the function of an apparatus to which we ascribe the characteristics of being extended in space and of being made up of several portions &lt;nowiki&gt;[&lt;/nowiki&gt;[[Id, ego and super-ego]].|Freud, ''An Outline of Psychoanalysis'' (1940)}}

As a [[Ego psychology|psychologist]], [[Sigmund Freud]] used the German terms '''''psychischer Apparat''''' and '''''seelischer Apparat''''', about the functioning of which he elaborates:

{{quote|We picture the unknown apparatus, which serves the activities of the mind, as being really like an instrument constructed of several parts (which we speak of as 'agencies'), each of which performs a particular function, and which have a fixed, spatial relation to one another: it being understood that by 'spatial relation'—'in front of' and 'behind', 'superficial' and 'deep'—we merely mean, in the first instance, a representation of the regular succession of the functions.|Freud, ''The Question of Lay Analysis'' (1926)}}

Freud proposed the psychic apparatus as solely a theoretic construct explaining the functioning of the [[mind]], and not a [[Neurology|neurologic]] structure of the [[brain]]:

{{quote|It is a [[hypothesis]], like so many others in the sciences: the very earliest ones have always been rather rough. 'Open to revision', we can say in such cases ... the value of a 'fiction' of this kind ... depends on how much one can achieve with its help.|Freud, ''The Question of Lay Analysis'' (1926)}}

Moreover, in emphasizing the immateriality of the psychic apparatus, Freud dismissed the matter of its physical substance:

{{quote|That is not a subject of psychological interest. [[Ego psychology|Psychology]] can be as indifferent to it as, for instance, optics can be to the question of whether the walls of a telescope are made of metal or cardboard. We shall leave entirely to one side the '''material''' line of approach.|Freud, ''The Question of Lay Analysis'' (1926)}}

{{Emotion}}
'''Resentment''' (also called '''ranklement''' or '''bitterness''') is a mixture of [[disappointment]], [[anger]] and [[fear]].&lt;ref&gt;TenHouten, W. D. (2007). ''General Theory of Emotions and Social Life''. Routledge.&lt;/ref&gt; It comprises the three basic emotions of [[disgust]], [[sadness]] and [[Surprise (emotion)|surprise]]—the [[perception]] of [[injustice]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=SrkxtpsuIZ8C&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|title = Forgiveness and resentment|date = |accessdate = |website = |publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt; As the [[Surprise (emotion)|surprise]] of [[injustice]] becomes less frequent, so too fades [[anger]] and [[fear]], leaving [[disappointment]] as the predominant [[emotion]].{{fact|date=July 2017}} So, to the extent perceived [[disgust]] and [[sadness]] remain, the level of [[disappointment]] also remains.{{fact|date=July 2017}} Resentment can be triggered by an emotionally disturbing experience felt again or relived in the mind.{{fact|date=July 2017}} When the person feeling resentment is directing the emotion at himself or herself, it appears as [[remorse]].

[[Robert C. Solomon]], a professor of philosophy at the [[University of Texas at Austin]], places resentment on the same continuum as anger and [[contempt]], and he argues that the differences between the three are that resentment is anger directed toward a higher-[[Social status|status]] individual; [[anger]] is directed toward an equal-status individual; and [[contempt]] is anger directed toward a lower-status individual.&lt;ref name="Solomon"&gt;Solomon R. C. (1993). ''The Passions: Emotions and the Meaning of Life''. Hackett Publishing.&lt;/ref&gt;

Resentment is not one of [[Paul Ekman]]'s six [[Emotion#Basic emotions|basic emotions]] ([[Surprise (emotion)|surprise]], [[disgust]], [[happiness]], [[sadness]], [[anger]], and [[fear]]). 

The word originates from [[French language|French]] "''ressentir''", re-, intensive prefix, and ''sentir'' "to feel"; from the [[Latin]] "''sentire''". The English word has become synonymous with anger and [[Spite (sentiment)|spite]].

==Quasi-psychology==

===Causes===
Resentment can result from a variety of situations, involving a perceived wrongdoing from an individual, which are often sparked by expressions of [[injustice]] or [[humiliation]]. Common sources of resentment include publicly humiliating incidents such as accepting negative treatment without voicing any protest, an object of regular [[discrimination]] or [[prejudice]], [[envy]]/[[jealousy]], feeling used or taken advantage of by others, and having achievements go unrecognized, while others succeed without working as hard. Resentment can also be generated by dyadic interactions, such as emotional rejection or denial by another person, deliberate embarrassment or belittling by another person, or ignorance, putting down, or scorn by another person.&lt;ref name="livestrong.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.livestrong.com/article/14691-handling-resentment/|title=Handling Resentment|publisher=Livestrong.com|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110123144425/http://www.livestrong.com/article/14691-handling-resentment/|archivedate=January 23, 2011|accessdate=August 2, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Signs===
[[File:PSM V36 D703 Pinched and bitter facial expression.jpg|thumb|right|200px|A pinched and bitter facial expression]]
Unlike many emotions, resentment does not have physical tags exclusively related to it that telegraph when a person is feeling this emotion. However, physical expressions associated with related emotions such as anger and envy may be exhibited, such as furrowed brows or bared teeth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Oatley |first1=Keith |first2=Dacher |last2=Keltner |first3=Jennifer M. |last3=Jenkins |chapter=Studies of the universality of facial expressions |title=Understanding Emotions |location=Oxford |publisher=Wiley-Blackwell |year=2006 |pages=88–90 |isbn=978-1-4051-3103-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Resentment can be self-diagnosed by looking for signs such as the need for [[emotion regulation]], such as faking happiness while with a person to cover true feelings toward him or speaking in a sarcastic or demeaning way to or about the person. It can also be diagnosed through the appearance of [[Emotion|agitation]]- or dejection-related emotions, such as feeling inexplicably [[Depression (mood)|depressed]] or [[despondent]], becoming angry for no apparent reason, or having [[nightmares]] or disturbing daydreams about a person.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.howtogetridofstuff.com/living/how-to-get-rid-of-resentment/|title=How To Get Rid Of Resentment|accessdate=August 2, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Effects===
Resentment is most powerful when it is felt toward someone whom the individual is close to or intimate with. To have an injury resulting in resentful feelings inflicted by a friend or loved one leaves the individual feeling betrayed as well as resentful, and these feelings can have deep effects.&lt;ref name="Murphy, Jeffrey G. pp 503-516"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1111/j.1475-4975.1982.tb00106.x |title=Forgiveness and Resentment |year=1982 |last1=Murphy |first1=Jeffrie G. |journal=Midwest Studies in Philosophy |volume=7 |issue=1 |pages=503–16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Resentment is an emotionally debilitating condition that, when unresolved, can have a variety of negative results on the person experiencing it, including touchiness or edginess when thinking of the person resented, denial of anger or hatred against this person, and provocation or anger arousal when this person is recognized positively. It can also have more long-term effects, such as the development of a hostile, cynical, sarcastic attitude that may become a barrier against other healthy relationships, lack of personal and emotional growth, difficulty in self-disclosure, trouble trusting others, loss of self-confidence, and overcompensation.&lt;ref name="livestrong.com"/&gt;

To further compound these negative effects, resentment often functions in a downward spiral. Resentful feelings cut off communication between the resentful person and the person he or she feels committed the wrong, and can result in future miscommunications and the development of further resentful feelings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine |url=http://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/anger-in-the-age-entitlement/200806/emotional-abuse-is-your-relationship-headed-there-you-might |title=Emotional Abuse: Is Your Relationship Headed There? You Might be a Lot Closer than You Think! |first=Steven |last=Stosny |magazine=Psychology Today |date=June 2008 |accessdate=August 2, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because of the consequences they carry, resentful feelings are dangerous to live with and need to be dealt with. Resentment is an obstacle to the restoration of equal moral relations among persons,&lt;ref name="Murphy, Jeffrey G. pp 503-516"/&gt; and must be handled and expunged via introspection and forgiveness.

Psychologist James J. Messina recommends five steps to facing and resolving resentful feelings. (1) Identify the source of the resentful feelings and what it is the person did to evoke these feelings, (2) develop a new way of looking at past, present and future life, including how resentment has affected life and how letting go of resentment can improve the future, (3) write a letter to the source of the resentment, listing offenses and explaining the circumstances, then forgive and let go of the offenses (but do not send the letter), (4) visualize a future without the negative impact of resentment, and (5) if resentful feelings still linger, return to Step 1 and begin again.&lt;ref name="livestrong.com"/&gt;

==Comparison with other emotions==
Resentment is considered to be synonymous with anger, spite, and other similar emotions. However, while it may incorporate elements of these emotions, resentment is distinct from them in several ways. Aside from sharing similar facial expressions, resentment and anger differ primarily in the way they are externally expressed. Anger results in aggressive behavior, used to avert or deal with a threat,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Moore |first1=Zella E. |last2=Gardner |first2=Frank L. |title=Understanding Clinical Anger and Violence: The Anger Avoidance Model |journal=Behavior Modification |date=July 9, 2008 |url=http://bmo.sagepub.com/content/early/2008/07/09/0145445508319282.short |doi=10.1177/0145445508319282 |accessdate=November 18, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; while resentment occurs once the injury has been dealt and is not expressed as aggressively or as openly.

Resentment and spite also differ primarily in the way they are expressed. Resentment is unique in that it is almost exclusively internalized, where it can do further emotional and psychological damage but does not strongly impact the person resented. By contrast, spite is exclusively externalized, involving vindictive actions against a (perceived or actual) source of wrong. Spiteful actions can stem from resentful feelings, however.

==Academic perspectives==
Philosopher [[Robert C. Solomon]] wrote extensively on the emotion of resentment and its negative effects on those who experience it. Solomon describes resentment as the means by which man clings to his self-respect. He wrote that it is in this moment when humanity is at its lowest ebb.

==Modern culture==
The [[Alcoholics Anonymous]] organization cites resentment as the number one offender, and one of the greatest threats to an alcoholic.&lt;ref&gt;AA Services. ''Alcoholics Anonymous: The Big Book''. Alcoholics Anonymous World Services, Inc., 4th edition; 2002.{{page needed|date=November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Several of the [[Twelve Steps]] of AA involve identifying and dealing with resentment as part of the path toward recovery, including acknowledging one's own role in resentment and praying for the resentment to be taken away.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.hazelden.org/web/public/has61016.page{{full citation needed|date=November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Resentment can also play a role in racial and ethnic conflicts. Resentment is cited as having infected the structure of social value, and is thus a regular catalyst in conflicts sparked by inequality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1080/09502389700490151 |title=Danger in the safety zone: Notes on race, resentment, and the discourse of crime, violence and suburban security |year=1997 |last1=McCarthy |first1=Cameron |last2=Rodriguez |first2=Alicia P. |last3=Buendia |first3=Ed |last4=Meacham |first4=Shuaib |last5=David |first5=Stephen |last6=Godina |first6=Heriberto |last7=Supriya |first7=K. E. |last8=Wilson-Brown |first8=Carrie |journal=Cultural Studies |volume=11 |issue=2 |pages=274–95 |oclc=222710414}}&lt;/ref&gt; It can also be one of the emotions experienced during [[class conflict]], particularly by the oppressed [[social class]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5651">'''Richard Benjamin Moore''' (9 August 1893 &amp;ndash; 1978) was a [[Barbados]]-born [[wikt:Afro-Caribbean|African-Caribbean]] [[civil rights]] activist and prominent [[Socialist]]. He was also one of the earlier advocates of the term [[African American]] as opposed to [[Negro]], or "black".&lt;ref&gt;Richard B. Moore, [https://books.google.com/books?id=3jPFh_vj3GAC&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false ''The Name "Negro": Its Origin and Evil Use''] (1960), Baltimore, MD: Black Classic Press, 1992.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==
===Early years===

Richard Benjamin Moore was a Barbadian writer born on 9 August 1893 in [[Barbados]], [[West Indies]], to Richard Henry Moore and Josephine Thorne Moore. In Barbados, the Richard Henry and Josephine Moore family was considered middle-class in terms of socioeconomic status. Richard Henry Moore was the moneymaker of the family, working as a [[preacher]] and building contractor in Barbados. Unfortunately, tragedy struck when Richard B. Moore’s mother died when he was three years old. Moore’s father later remarried, to Elizabeth Mclean. Soon thereafter, Moore’s father died in 1902 when young Richard was aged nine. With both biological parents dead, Moore was raised by his stepmother Elizabeth Mclean.

Mclean wanted to carry out Richard senior’s wishes of giving young Richard the best education. It is for this reason that Mclean aided young Richard in traveling to the [[United States]]. In hopes of furthering his education, Moore migrated to The United States of America and arrived in [[New York City]] on 4 July 1909. However, Moore would not become a naturalised citizen until 11 September 1924. Although African Americans were free in the United States, they were far from being treated equal to [[European-Americans]] in America. Moore was immediately faced with [[ethnic discrimination]] when it came to employment and educational opportunities among other things. Although trained in Barbados to do clerical work, he was forced to turn to the more unfavourable jobs such as elevator operator and work in a silk manufacturing firm.

===Political activism===

Due to the struggles that Moore encountered and observed, he became a strong vocalist for the rights of African Americans. In 1919 he joined the [[African Blood Brotherhood]] (ABB), which was an organization formed to defend African Americans from [[race riots]] and [[lynching]]. Moore, along with other African-American advocates, joined the [[Socialist Party]] in the early 1920s. Moore joined the Socialist Party, in part, because at the time the Socialist party was transforming itself into a force to fight against segregation.

Moore was a frequent political candidate of the Socialist Party. In 1928 he ran for [[U.S. Congress]] in New York's 21st Congressional District.&lt;ref&gt;"Red Ticket Goes on Ballot in NY State", ''Daily Worker,'' vol. 5, no. 241 (11 October 1928), p. 3.&lt;/ref&gt; In [[New York state election, 1934|1934]], Moore ran on the Socialist ticket for [[Chief Judge of the New York Court of Appeals]]. In 1935, he became the organiser for the [[International Labor Defense]] in the [[New England]] Territory. He used his position in this organisation to speak on behalf the [[Scottsboro Boys]], a case in which nine young African-American males were accused of raping two young European-American women. 

In 1942, Moore was expelled from the Socialist Party because he was accused of being an [[Black nationalism|African-American nationalist]]; keeping African-American issues on the front burner.

He continued his efforts for [[Civil rights|equal rights]] in America. He also played a leading role in [[Caribbean]] advocacy groups. Moore, like his friend [[Hubert Harrison]], was a bibliophile, collecting over 15,000 books and pamphlets on the African-American experiences worldwide. This collection of books is currently housed in a library that Moore developed in Barbados. Moore also ran the [[Frederick Douglass]] Book Center in Harlem. 

Moore wrote a few books himself, including ''The Name Negro, Its Origin and Evil Use'' (1960) and ''Caribs, Cannibals and Human Relations'' (1972). He also had essays and articles published in various magazines and journals including the ''Negro Champion'', ''Daily Worker'', and ''Freedomways''.

===Death and legacy===

Richard Benjamin Moore died in his homeland of Barbados in 1978 at the age of 85.

'''Robert Warren Spike''' (November 13, 1923 &amp;ndash; October 17, 1966) was an American clergyman, theologian, and civil rights leader.

==Early life==

Spike was born in Buffalo, New York and educated at [[Denison University]], [[Union Theological Seminary (New York City)|Union Theological Seminary]], [[Columbia University]], and [[Colgate-Rochester Divinity School]]. He began his career as pastor at the [[mainline Protestant]] [[Judson Memorial Church]] on [[Washington Square Park|Washington Square]] in [[Greenwich Village]] in 1949, reviving the social activism of this famous urban church.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Judson Memorial Church|url=http://www.judson.org/Historical-Overview|access-date=12 Apr 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; During his tenure there neighborhood kids played basketball in the church’s ramshackle gym and an interracial, international residence for students was established. Spike also helped to create an art gallery where artists such as [[Claes Oldenburg]], [[Allen Kaprow]] and [[Jim Dine]] could exhibit their, then unconventional, work.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Remembering Judson House|year=2000|publisher=Judson Memorial Church|location=New York|isbn=9780970293503|pages=279–280}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Civil rights==

In 1958 Spike left his parish ministry to take on a national role as General Secretary of the United Church Board For Homeland Ministries. In 1963 he was appointed the Executive Director of the [[National Council of Churches]]’ Commission on Religion and Race, which became an important arm of the [[Civil Rights Movement]].  [[Anna Arnold Hedgeman]] joined his staff there as a Coordinator of Special Events.  Through Spike’s efforts Protestant churches participated significantly in the [[March on Washington]] in August 1963. Spike worked with [[Robert Parris Moses]] to set up the [[Freedom Summer]] project.&lt;ref name=Findlay&gt;{{cite book|last=Findlay|first=James F.|title=Church people in the struggle : the National Council of Churches and the black freedom movement, 1950-1970|year=1993|publisher=Oxford University|isbn=0195079671}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Freedom Summer, 50 years on|url=http://www.jewishworldreview.com/david/shribman061614.php3#.VSr5Aaa84TM|access-date=12 Apr 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Death==

In January 1966 Spike took a position as Professor of Ministry and Director of the Doctor of Ministry Program in the Divinity School at the University of Chicago. Less than a year after assuming his post in Chicago, Spike was bludgeoned to death at Ohio State University in Columbus on October 17, 1966.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Columbus NewsIndex|url=http://www.columbuslibrary.org/cmlcnix/searchresults.cfm?sort=&amp;afterdate=&amp;beforedate=&amp;searchlist=MINOR%2C%20WILLIAM%20R%20%28ROBERT%20SPIKE%20HOMICIDE%20CASE%29&amp;searchindex=S&amp;pub=ALL|access-date=12 Apr 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; No one was ever tried for his murder; after a systematic review some church sources believe that he was assassinated.&lt;ref name=Findlay/&gt; Police investigations attempted to link Spike's murder with his bisexuality.&lt;ref name=Findlay/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Spike|first=Paul|title=Photographs of my father|year=1973|publisher=Knopf|isbn=0394473345}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Upon learning of Rev. Spike's death, [[Martin Luther King Jr]]. was quoted as stating, "He was one of those rare individuals who sought at every point to make religion relevant to the social issues of our time. He lifted religion from the stagnant arena of pious irrelevancies and sanctimonious trivialities. His brilliant and dedicated work will be an inspiration to generals yet unborn. We will always remember his unswerving devotion to the legitimate aspirations of oppressed people for freedom and human dignity. It was my personal pleasure and sacred privilege to work closely with him in various undertakings."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Rhetoric, religion and the civil rights movement, 1954-1965|year=2006|publisher=Baylor University|location=Waco, TX|isbn=9781932792546|page=668}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Spike's son, [[Paul Robert Spike]] is an [[United States|American]] [[author]], [[editor in chief|editor]] and [[journalist]] best known as the author of the 1973 [[memoir]] ''Photographs of My Father'' about the murder of his father, in 1966.

{{about|the term as used in folklore and superstition|the main meaning of the modern German word|blessing|the Hebrew term|segan}}

'''''Segen''''' is a German word translating to "blessing, benediction; charm; prayer; spell, incantation".

It is in origin a loan from Latin ''signum''  ''sīgnāre'' "to make a sign", viz. the [[Sign of the Cross]] used to confer a Christian [[blessing]],
The term is attested as  [[Old High German]] ''seganōn'' from as early as c. AD 800, resulting in a modern ''segnen'' "to bless". The noun ''Segen'' "blessing" was derived from the verb at an early time, attested in the 9th century as ''segan''.
[[Old English]] hat the corresponding ''sægnan'', which survives as the dialectal (esp. Scottish) ''sain'' (popularized by Scott, ''[[The Heart of Midlothian|Heart of Mid-Lothian]]'' "God sain us").
The concept of ''Segen'', understood [[magical thinking|magically]], was very productive in the [[folklore]], [[folk religion]] and [[superstition]] of [[German-speaking Europe]], studied in great detail by the German philologists and folklorists of the 19th century.

The medieval church used the ''Segen'' (the sign of the cross with a spoken formula) liberally, intended as an act with protective effect, putting the person or thing blessed under the protection of God. Nor was the action reserved for priests or clerics, but any Christian was permitted to make the sign of the cross and invoke the protection of God. Thus the ''Segen'' came to be seen as the inverse of the [[curse]] (''Fluch''), magical acts with the power to either protect or harm.  
&lt;!--The blessing offered by parents (''vater- &amp; muttersegen, benedictio parentum, paternum et maternum votum'') was considered particularly effective, presumably based on the narratives of the Old Testament (Hebrew  ''barak'' בָּרַךְ lit. "to kneel").
--&gt; 
The concept of ''Segen'' thus became the continuant of the incantation formulas of the [[Germanic paganism|pre-Christian period]]  (the only surviving samples of which are the [[Merseburg Incantations]]).

Use of such formulas was partly encouraged by the Church, as they did superficially involve an expression of piety by the invocation of God, Christ or the Virgin Mary, but at the same time their magical use was viewed with scepticism and was sometimes repressed.&lt;ref&gt;Grimm, ''[[Deutsches Wörterbuch]]'' citing "E. H. Meyer myth. 23"."{{Clarify|date=April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
By the time  of the [[Early Modern witch-hunts]], the term ''segen'' had become ambiguous, and depending on context could refer to a harmless farewell, to a  pious invocation of God, or to a Satanic or superstitious spell  (''pro incantamento et adjuratione magica'' Stieler 1669{{Clarify|date=April 2013}}; e.g. ''[[Wolfssegen]]'' "contra lupos").
{{verse translation|lang=de|
si (landstreicher) kunnen sagen vom vinstern sternen und tuond die lüt segen lernen für den donder und den hagel
|
they [vagabonds] know tales of dark stars and teach people ''spells'' [segen] for [to control] thunder and hail.
|attr1=''[[Des Teufels Netz]]'' v. 6367 (15th century)}}

This early modern usage survives in dialectal variation throughout the rural parts of German-speaking Europe.
For [[German-speaking Switzerland]], the ''[[Schweizerisches Idiotikon]]'' [http://www.idiotikon.ch/Register/faksimile.php?&amp;band=7&amp;spalte=444 7,444 "Sëgeⁿ"] 
records some  two dozen compounds in ''-sëgeⁿ'', in some of which ''Segen'' takes the meaning "prayer" and in others "spell, charm".

A notable concept in Swiss folklore is the ''Alpsegen'' (''Alpe(n)sëgeⁿ, Alpsëgeⁿ''  [https://web.archive.org/web/20130325231631/http://digital.idiotikon2.ch/idtkn/id7.htm#page/70451/mode/1up 7,451]), a folk religious custom in Alpine Switzerland where every night 
a prayer must be sung over each [[Alpine pasture]]. This combined the function of an apotropaic charm with a practical aspect of communicating between remote pastures; if the ''Alpsegen'' was not heard from a neighbouring site, it would be a sign that a misfortune or accident had befallen and the neighbours would come to aid.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3948">'''Sociometer''' theory is a theory of [[self-esteem]] from an [[evolutionary psychology|evolutionary psychological]] perspective that proposes that state [[self-esteem]] is a gauge (or sociometer) of interpersonal relationships. This theoretical perspective was first introduced by [[Mark Leary]] and colleagues in 1995&lt;ref&gt;Leary, M. R., &amp; Downs, D. L. (1995). Interpersonal functions of the self-esteem motive: The self-esteem system as a sociometer. In M. H. Kernis (Ed.), Efficacy, Agency, and Self-Esteem (pp. 123-144). New York: Plenum Press.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Leary, M. R., Tambor, E. S., Terdal, S. K., &amp; Downs, D. L. (1995). Self-esteem as an interpersonal monitor: The sociometer hypothesis. Journal of Personality &amp; Social Psychology, 68(3), 518-530.&lt;/ref&gt; and later expanded on by Kirkpatrick and Ellis.&lt;ref&gt;Kirkpatrick, L. A., &amp; Ellis, B. J. (2001). An evolutionary-psychological approach to self-esteem: multiple domains and multiple functions. In G. J. O. Fletcher &amp; M. S. Clark (Eds.), Blackwell handbook of social psychology: Interpersonal processes (pp. 411-436). Oxford, UK: Blackwell Publishers.&lt;/ref&gt;
In Leary’s research, the idea of self-esteem as a sociometer is discussed in depth. This theory was created as a response to psychological phenomenon i.e. social emotions, inter- and intra- personal behaviors, self-serving biases, and reactions to rejection. Based on this theory, self-esteem is a measure of effectiveness in social relations and interactions that monitors acceptance and/or rejection from others.&lt;ref&gt;Leary, M. R. (2005): Sociometer Theory and The Pursuit of Relational Value: Getting to the Root of Self-Esteem, ''European Review of Social Psychology'', 16, 75-111&lt;/ref&gt; With this, an emphasis is placed on relational value, which is the degree to which a person regards his or her relationship with another, and how it affects day-to-day life. Confirmed by various studies and research, if a person is deemed having relational value, they are more likely to have higher self-esteem. According to Leary, there are five main groups associated with relational value that are classified as those affording the greatest impact on an individual. They are: 1) macro-level, i.e., communities, 2) instrumental coalitions, i.e., teams, committees, 3) mating relationships, 4) kin relationships, and 5) friendships. A study was conducted to see just how much people depend on peers and outside factors and relational values to regulate their life. The objective of the study was to pick groups for an activity based on the evaluations given by the students.  In the study, two groups were assigned. Both groups consisted of college students that submitted and were subjected to a peer evaluation. The difference being that the control group of students chose if they 1) wanted to interact with the person or 2) dissociated from the person. Previously asked, some students stated that they were indifferent or did not care what others' opinions of them were. However, when results were analyzed there was a great deal of fluctuation in overall self-esteem. Those who were placed in the second group (of dissociation), receiving a low relational value, displayed a lowered self-esteem. As a result, this compromised the way they assessed a/the situation. In the first group, where perceived relational value was high, self-esteem was also high. This provides some evidence for an evolutionary basis in the fundamental human need for inclusion in a group, and the burden of being on the outskirts of social acceptance.&lt;ref&gt;Leary, M. R. (2005): Sociometer Theory and The Pursuit of Relational Value: Getting to the Root of Self-Esteem, ''European Review of Social Psychology'', 16, 75-111&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10213">:''"Spherical tensor" redirects to here. For the concept related to operators see [[tensor operator]].''

In [[pure mathematics|pure]] and [[applied mathematics]], particularly [[quantum mechanics]] and [[computer graphics]] and their applications, a '''spherical basis''' is the [[basis (linear algebra)|basis]] used to express '''spherical tensors'''.  The spherical basis closely relates to the description of angular momentum in quantum mechanics and spherical harmonic functions.

While [[spherical polar coordinates]] are one [[orthogonal coordinates|orthogonal coordinate system]] for expressing vectors and tensors using polar and azimuthal angles and radial distance, the spherical basis are constructed from the [[standard basis]] and use [[complex number]]s.

==Spherical basis in three dimensions==

A vector '''A''' in 3D [[Euclidean space]] {{math|ℝ&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;}} can be expressed in the familiar [[Cartesian coordinate system]] in the [[standard basis]] '''e'''&lt;sub&gt;''x''&lt;/sub&gt;, '''e'''&lt;sub&gt;''y''&lt;/sub&gt;, '''e'''&lt;sub&gt;''z''&lt;/sub&gt;, and [[Coordinate vector|coordinates]] ''A&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;'', ''A&lt;sub&gt;y&lt;/sub&gt;'', ''A&lt;sub&gt;z&lt;/sub&gt;'':

{{NumBlk|:|&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{A} = A_x \mathbf{e}_x + A_y \mathbf{e}_y + A_z \mathbf{e}_z &lt;/math&gt;|{{EquationRef|1}}}}

or any other [[coordinate system]] with associated [[basis (linear algebra)|basis]] set of vectors. From this extend the scalars to allow multiplication by complex numbers, so that we are now working in &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{C}^3&lt;/math&gt; rather than &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{R}^3&lt;/math&gt;.

===Basis definition===

In the spherical bases denoted '''e'''&lt;sub&gt;+&lt;/sub&gt;, '''e'''&lt;sub&gt;−&lt;/sub&gt;, '''e'''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;, and associated coordinates with respect to this basis, denoted ''A''&lt;sub&gt;+&lt;/sub&gt;, ''A''&lt;sub&gt;−&lt;/sub&gt;, ''A''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;, the vector '''A''' is:

{{NumBlk|:|&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{A}  = A_+ \mathbf{e}_{+} + A_{-} \mathbf{e}_{-} + A_0 \mathbf{e}_0 &lt;/math&gt;|{{EquationRef|2}}}}

where the spherical basis vectors can be defined in terms of the Cartesian basis using [[complex number|complex]]-valued coefficients in the ''xy'' plane:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Angular Momentum|author=W.J. Thompson|year=2008|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|page=311|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0NMjkQnQN6oC&amp;pg=PA311&amp;lpg=PA311&amp;dq=spherical+basis+tensor#v=onepage&amp;q=spherical%20basis%20tensor&amp;f=false|isbn=9783527617838}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{NumBlk|:|&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
\mathbf{e}_+ &amp; = -\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \mathbf{e}_x -\frac{i}{\sqrt{2}}\mathbf{e}_y \\
\mathbf{e}_{-} &amp; = +\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\mathbf{e}_x - \frac{i}{\sqrt{2}}\mathbf{e}_y \\
\end{align} \quad \rightleftharpoons \quad \mathbf{e}_\pm = \mp\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\left(\mathbf{e}_x \pm i\mathbf{e}_y\right)\,&lt;/math&gt;|{{EquationRef|3A}}}}

in which ''i'' denotes the [[imaginary unit]], and one normal to the plane in the ''z'' direction:

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{e}_0 = \mathbf{e}_z &lt;/math&gt;

The inverse relations are:

{{NumBlk|:|&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}\mathbf{e}_x &amp; = - \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \mathbf{e}_+ + \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\mathbf{e}_{-} \\
\mathbf{e}_y &amp; = + \frac{i}{\sqrt{2}} \mathbf{e}_+ + \frac{i}{\sqrt{2}}\mathbf{e}_{-} \\
\mathbf{e}_z &amp; = \mathbf{e}_0
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;|{{EquationRef|3B}}}}

===Commutator definition===
While giving a basis in a 3-dimensional space is a valid definition for a spherical tensor, it only covers the case for when the rank &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt; is 1. For higher ranks, one may use either the commutator, or rotation definition of a spherical tensor. The commutator definition is given below, any operator &lt;math&gt;T_q^{(k)}&lt;/math&gt; that satisfies the following relations is a spherical tensor :


&lt;math&gt;[J_{\pm}, T_q^{(k)}]=\hbar \sqrt{(k\mp q)(k\pm q+1)}T_{q\pm 1}^{(k)}&lt;/math&gt;


&lt;math&gt;[J_{z}, T_q^{(k)}]=\hbar q T_q^{(k)}&lt;/math&gt;


===Rotation definition===

Analogously to how the [[spherical harmonics]] transform under a rotation, a general spherical tensor  transforms as follows,  when the states transform under the [[unitary operator|unitary]] [[Wigner D-matrix]] &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{D}(R)&lt;/math&gt;, where {{mvar|R}} is a (3×3 rotation) group element in [[SO(3)]]. That is, these matrices represent the rotation group elements. With the help of its [[Lie algebra]], one can show these two definitions are equivalent. 
:&lt;math&gt;\mathcal{D}^{\dagger}(R)T_q^{(k)}\mathcal{D}(R) = \sum_{q^{\prime} = -k}^k\mathcal{D}_{qq^{\prime}}^{(k)}T_{q^{\prime}}^{(k)}&lt;/math&gt;

{{see also| Wigner D-matrix}}

===Coordinate vectors===

{{main|Coordinate vector}}

For the spherical basis, the [[Coordinate vector|coordinates]] are complex-valued numbers ''A''&lt;sub&gt;+&lt;/sub&gt;, ''A''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;, ''A''&lt;sub&gt;−&lt;/sub&gt;, and can be found by substitution of ({{EquationNote|3B}}) into ({{EquationNote|1}}), or directly calculated from the [[dot product#Complex vectors|inner product]] {{langle}}, {{rangle}} ({{EquationNote|5}}):

{{NumBlk|:|&lt;math&gt; 
\begin{align}
A_+ &amp; = \left\langle \mathbf{e}_+, \mathbf{A}  \right\rangle = -\frac{A_x}{\sqrt{2}} + \frac{iA_y}{\sqrt{2}} \\
A_{-} &amp; = \left\langle \mathbf{e}_{-}, \mathbf{A}  \right\rangle = +\frac{A_x}{\sqrt{2}} + \frac{iA_y}{\sqrt{2}} \\
\end{align} \quad \rightleftharpoons \quad A_\pm = \left\langle \mathbf{e}_\pm, \mathbf{A} \right\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \left( \mp A_x + iA_y \right) &lt;/math&gt;|{{EquationRef|4A}}}}

:&lt;math&gt; A_0 = \left\langle \mathbf{e}_0, \mathbf{A}  \right\rangle = \left\langle \mathbf{e}_z, \mathbf{A}  \right\rangle = A_z &lt;/math&gt;

with inverse relations:

{{NumBlk|:|&lt;math&gt;\begin{align} 
A_x &amp; = - \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} A_+ + \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} A_{-} \\
A_y &amp; = - \frac{i}{\sqrt{2}} A_+ - \frac{i}{\sqrt{2}} A_{-} \\
A_z &amp; = A_0
\end{align} &lt;/math&gt;|{{EquationRef|4B}}}}

In general, for two vectors with complex coefficients in the same real-valued orthonormal basis '''e'''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;, with the property '''e'''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;·'''e'''&lt;sub&gt;''j''&lt;/sub&gt; = ''δ&lt;sub&gt;ij&lt;/sub&gt;'', the [[dot product#Complex vectors|inner product]] is:

{{NumBlk|:|&lt;math&gt;\left\langle \mathbf{a} , \mathbf{b} \right\rangle = \mathbf{a} \cdot \mathbf{b}^\star = \sum_j a_j b_j^\star &lt;/math&gt;|{{EquationRef|5}}}}

where · is the usual [[dot product]] and the [[complex conjugate]] * must be used to keep the [[norm (mathematics)|magnitude (or "norm")]] of the vector [[Positive definiteness|positive definite]].

==Properties (three dimensions)==

===Orthonormality===

The spherical basis is an [[orthonormal basis]], since the [[dot product#Complex vectors|inner product]] {{langle}}, {{rangle}} ({{EquationNote|5}}) of every pair vanishes meaning the basis vectors are all mutually [[orthogonality|orthogonal]]:

:&lt;math&gt;\left\langle \mathbf{e}_+ , \mathbf{e}_{-} \right\rangle = \left\langle \mathbf{e}_{-} , \mathbf{e}_0 \right\rangle = \left\langle \mathbf{e}_0 , \mathbf{e}_+ \right\rangle = 0 &lt;/math&gt;

and each basis vector is a [[unit vector]]:

:&lt;math&gt; \left\langle\mathbf{e}_+ , \mathbf{e}_{+} \right\rangle = \left\langle\mathbf{e}_{-} , \mathbf{e}_{-} \right\rangle = \left\langle\mathbf{e}_0 , \mathbf{e}_0 \right\rangle = 1 &lt;/math&gt;

hence the need for the normalizing factors of 1/{{sqrt|2}}.

===Change of basis matrix===

{{see also|change of basis}}

The defining relations ({{EquationNote|3A}}) can be summarized by a [[transformation matrix]] '''U''':

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{pmatrix}
\mathbf{e}_+ \\
\mathbf{e}_{-} \\
\mathbf{e}_0
\end{pmatrix} = \mathbf{U}\begin{pmatrix}
\mathbf{e}_x \\
\mathbf{e}_y \\
\mathbf{e}_z
\end{pmatrix} \,,\quad \mathbf{U} = \begin{pmatrix}
- \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} &amp; - \frac{i}{\sqrt{2}} &amp; 0 \\
+ \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} &amp; - \frac{i}{\sqrt{2}} &amp; 0 \\
0 &amp; 0 &amp; 1
\end{pmatrix}\,,
&lt;/math&gt;

with inverse:

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{pmatrix}
\mathbf{e}_x \\
\mathbf{e}_y \\
\mathbf{e}_z
\end{pmatrix} = \mathbf{U}^{-1}\begin{pmatrix}
\mathbf{e}_+ \\
\mathbf{e}_{-} \\
\mathbf{e}_0
\end{pmatrix} \,,\quad \mathbf{U}^{-1} = \begin{pmatrix}
- \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} &amp; + \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} &amp; 0 \\
+ \frac{i}{\sqrt{2}} &amp; + \frac{i}{\sqrt{2}} &amp; 0 \\
0 &amp; 0 &amp; 1
\end{pmatrix}\,.&lt;/math&gt;

It can be seen that '''U''' is a [[unitary matrix]], in other words its [[Hermitian conjugate]] '''U'''&lt;sup&gt;†&lt;/sup&gt; ([[complex conjugate]] and [[matrix transpose]]) is also the [[inverse matrix]]  '''U'''&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;.

For the coordinates:

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{pmatrix}
A_+ \\
A_{-} \\
A_0
\end{pmatrix} =\mathbf{U}^\mathrm{*} \begin{pmatrix}
A_x \\
A_y \\
A_z
\end{pmatrix} \,,\quad \mathbf{U}^\mathrm{*} = \begin{pmatrix}
- \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} &amp; + \frac{i}{\sqrt{2}} &amp; 0 \\
+ \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} &amp; + \frac{i}{\sqrt{2}} &amp; 0 \\
0 &amp; 0 &amp; 1
\end{pmatrix}\,,
&lt;/math&gt;

and inverse:

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{pmatrix}
A_x \\
A_y \\
A_z
\end{pmatrix} = (\mathbf{U}^\mathrm{*})^{-1} \begin{pmatrix}
A_+ \\
A_{-} \\
A_0
\end{pmatrix} \,,\quad (\mathbf{U}^\mathrm{*})^{-1} = \begin{pmatrix}
- \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} &amp; + \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} &amp; 0 \\
- \frac{i}{\sqrt{2}} &amp; - \frac{i}{\sqrt{2}} &amp; 0 \\
0 &amp; 0 &amp; 1
\end{pmatrix}\,.
&lt;/math&gt;

===Cross products===

Taking [[cross product]]s of the spherical basis vectors, we find an obvious relation:

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{e}_{q}\times\mathbf{e}_{q} = \boldsymbol{0}&lt;/math&gt;

where ''q'' is a placeholder for +, −, 0, and two less obvious relations:

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{e}_{\pm}\times\mathbf{e}_{\mp} = \pm i \mathbf{e}_0&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{e}_{\pm}\times\mathbf{e}_{0} = \pm i \mathbf{e}_{\pm}&lt;/math&gt;

===Inner product in the spherical basis===

The inner product between two vectors '''A''' and '''B''' in the spherical basis follows from the above definition of the inner product:

:&lt;math&gt;\left\langle \mathbf{A} , \mathbf{B} \right\rangle = A_+ B_+^\star + A_{-}B_{-}^\star + A_0 B_0^\star &lt;/math&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="30170">[[Victimization]] refers to a person being made into a victim by someone else and can take on psychological as well as physical forms, both of which are damaging to victims.&lt;ref name="number7"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Lawrence|first1=Erika|last2=Yoon|first2=Jeungeun|last3=Langer|first3=Amie|last4=Ro|first4=Eunyoe|title=Is Psychological Aggression as Detrimental as Physical Aggression?&lt;BR&gt; The Independent Effects of Psychological Aggression on Depression and Anxiety Symptoms|journal=Violence and Victims|date=1 February 2009|volume=24|issue=1|pages=20–35|doi=10.1891/0886-6708.24.1.20}}&lt;/ref&gt; Forms of victimization include (but are not limited to) [[bullying]] or [[peer victimization]], [[physical abuse]], [[sexual abuse]], [[verbal abuse]], [[robbery]], and [[assault]]. Some of these forms of victimization are commonly associated with certain populations, but they can happen to others as well. For example, bullying or peer victimization is most commonly studied in children and adolescents but also takes place between adults.&lt;ref name="number6"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Aquino|first1=Karl|last2=Douglas|first2=Scott|last3=Martinko|first3=Mark J.|title=Overt Anger in Response to Victimization: Attributional Style and Organizational Norms as Moderators.|journal=Journal of Occupational Health Psychology|date=2004|volume=9|issue=2|pages=152–164|doi=10.1037/1076-8998.9.2.152}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although anyone may be victimized, particular groups (e.g. children, the elderly, individuals with disabilities) may be more susceptible to certain types of victimization and as a result to the symptoms and consequences that follow. Individuals respond to victimization in a wide variety of ways, so noticeable '''symptoms of victimization''' will vary from person to person. These symptoms may take on several different forms (e.g. psychological, behavioral, or physical), be associated with specific forms of victimization, and be moderated by individual characteristics of the victim and/or experiences after victimization.

==Categories of outcomes==
Symptoms of victimization may include negative physical, [[psychology|psychological]], or [[behavior]]al consequences that are direct or indirect responses (see physical symptoms section) to victimization experiences. Symptoms in these categories sometimes overlap, are closely related, or cause each other. For example, a behavioral symptom such as an increase in aggressiveness or irritability may be part of a particular psychological outcome such as [[posttraumatic stress disorder]].&lt;ref name="number 8"/&gt; Much of the research on symptoms of victimization is cross-sectional (researchers only collected data at one point in time). From a research perspective this means that the symptoms are associated with victimization, but the causal relationship is not always established and alternative explanations have not been ruled out.&lt;ref name="number1"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Juvonen|first1=Jaana|last2=Graham|first2=Sandra|title=Bullying in Schools: The Power of Bullies and the Plight of Victims|journal=Annual Review of Psychology|date=3 January 2014|volume=65|issue=1|pages=159–185|doi=10.1146/annurev-psych-010213-115030|pmid=23937767}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some of the symptoms described also may put individuals at risk for victimization. For example, there may be a two-way relationship between victimization and certain internalizing symptoms such as depression or withdrawal, such that victimization increases these symptoms, and individuals exhibiting these symptoms may be targeted for victimization more often than others.&lt;ref name="number2"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Reijntjes|first1=Albert|last2=Kamphuis|first2=Jan H.|last3=Prinzie|first3=Peter|last4=Telch|first4=Michael J.|title=Peer victimization and internalizing problems in children: A meta-analysis of longitudinal studies|journal=Child Abuse &amp; Neglect|date=April 2010|volume=34|issue=4|pages=244–252|doi=10.1016/j.chiabu.2009.07.009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Psychological===
The experience of being victimized may cause an individual to feel vulnerable or helpless, as well as changing their view of the world and/or their self-perception; the psychological distress this causes may manifest in a number of ways.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Janoff-Bulman|first1=Ronnie|last2=Frieze|first2=Irene Hanson|title=A Theoretical Perspective for Understanding Reactions to Victimization|journal=Journal of Social Issues|date=July 1983|volume=39|issue=2|pages=1–17|doi=10.1111/j.1540-4560.1983.tb00138.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Diagnosable psychological disorders that are associated with victimization experiences include [[Depression (mood)|depression]], [[anxiety]], and [[post-traumatic stress disorder]] (PTSD). Psychological symptoms that are disruptive to a person's life may be present in some form even if they do not meet diagnostic criteria for a specific disorder. A variety of symptoms such as [[Social withdrawal|withdrawal]], [[avoidance coping|avoidance]], and [[nightmares]], may be part of one of these diagnosable disorders or may occur in milder or more isolated form; diagnoses of particular disorders require that these symptoms have a particular degree of severity or frequency, or that an individual exhibits a certain number of them in order to be formally diagnosed.&lt;ref name="number 8"/&gt;

====Depression====

[[Depression (mood)|Depression]] has been found to be associated with many forms of victimization, including sexual victimization, violent crime, property crime, peer victimization, and [[domestic abuse]].&lt;ref name="number3"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Feiring|first1=Candice|last2=Simon|first2=Valerie A.|last3=Cleland|first3=Charles M.|title=Childhood sexual abuse, stigmatization, internalizing symptoms, and the development of sexual difficulties and dating aggression.|journal=Journal of Consulting and Clinical Psychology|date=2009|volume=77|issue=1|pages=127–137|doi=10.1037/a0013475|pmid=19170459}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="number4"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Herek|first1=Gregory M.|last2=Gillis|first2=J.

Depression can impact many other areas of a person's life as well, including interpersonal relationships and physical health.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hammen|first1=Constance L.|last2=Peters|first2=Stefanie D.|title=Interpersonal consequences of depression: Responses to men and women enacting a depressed role.|journal=Journal of Abnormal Psychology|date=1978|volume=87|issue=3|pages=322–332|doi=10.1037/0021-843X.87.8.322}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Penninx|first1=Brenda WJH|last2=Milaneschi|first2=Yuri|last3=Lamers|first3=Femke|last4=Vogelzangs|first4=Nicole|title=Understanding the somatic consequences of depression: biological mechanisms and the role of depression symptom profile|journal=BMC Medicine|date=2013|volume=11|issue=1|pages=129|doi=10.1186/1741-7015-11-129}}&lt;/ref&gt; Depression in response to victimization may be lethal, as it can result in suicidal ideation and suicide attempts. Examples of this include a ten-fold increase found in suicide attempts among [[rape]] victims compared to the general population, and significant correlations between being victimized in school and suicidal ideation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Kilpatrick|first1=Dean G.|last2=Best|first2=Connie L.|last3=Veronen|first3=Lois J.|last4=Amick|first4=Angelynne E.|last5=Villeponteaux|first5=Lorenz A.|last6=Ruff|first6=Gary A.|title=Mental health correlates of criminal victimization: A random community survey.|journal=Journal of Consulting and Clinical Psychology|date=1985|volume=53|issue=6|pages=866–873|doi=10.1037/0022-006X.53.6.866}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Rigby|first1=Ken|last2=Slee|first2=Phillip|title=Suicidal ideation among adolescent school children, involvement in bully-victim problems, and perceived social support|journal=Suicide and Life-Threatening Behavior|date=1999|volume=29|issue=2|pages=119–130}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Anxiety====

A connection between victimization and [[anxiety]] has been established for both children and adults.&lt;ref name="context"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Bellmore|first1=Amy D.|last2=Witkow|first2=Melissa R.|last3=Graham|first3=Sandra|last4=Juvonen|first4=Jaana|title=Beyond the Individual: The Impact of Ethnic Context and Classroom Behavioral Norms on Victims' Adjustment.|journal=Developmental Psychology|date=2004|volume=40|issue=6|pages=1159–1172|doi=10.1037/0012-1649.40.6.1159|pmid=15535764}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="help"/&gt; The particular types of anxiety studied in relation to victimization vary; some research references anxiety as a general term while other research references more specific types such as social anxiety.&lt;ref name="context"/&gt; The term anxiety covers a range of difficulties and several specific diagnoses, including panic attacks, phobias, and generalized anxiety disorder.  Panic attacks are relatively short, intense bursts of fear that may or may not have a trigger (a cause in the immediate environment that happens right before they occur). They are sometimes a part of other anxiety disorders. Phobias may be specific to objects, situations, people, or places. They can result in avoidance behaviors or, if avoidance is not possible, extreme anxiety or panic attacks. Generalized anxiety is characterized by long-term, uncontrolled, intense worrying in addition to other symptoms such as irritability, sleep problems, or restlessness.&lt;ref name="number 8"/&gt; Anxiety has been shown to disrupt many aspects of people's lives as well, e.g. academic functioning, and to predict worse health outcomes later in life.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Van Ameringen|first1=Michael|last2=Mancini|first2=Catherine|last3=Farvolden|first3=Peter|title=The impact of anxiety disorders on educational achievement|journal=Journal of Anxiety Disorders|date=January 2003|volume=17|issue=5|pages=561–571|doi=10.1016/S0887-6185(02)00228-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=BARDONE|first1=ANNA M.|last2=MOFFITT|first2=TERRIE E.|last3=CASPI|first3=AVSHALOM|last4=DICKSON|first4=NIGEL|last5=STANTON|first5=WARREN R.|last6=SILVA|first6=PHIL A.|title=Adult Physical Health Outcomes of Adolescent Girls With Conduct Disorder, Depression, and Anxiety|journal=Journal of the American Academy of Child &amp; Adolescent Psychiatry|date=June 1998|volume=37|issue=6|pages=594–601|doi=10.1097/00004583-199806000-00009}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
====Posttraumatic stress disorder====

[[Posttraumatic stress disorder]] (PTSD) is a specific anxiety disorder in response to a traumatic event in a person's life. It is often discussed in the context of mental health of combat veterans, but also occurs in individuals who have been traumatized in other ways, such as victimization. PTSD involves long-term intense fear, re-experiencing the traumatic event (e.g. nightmares), avoidance of reminders of the event, and being highly reactive (e.g. easily enraged or startled).&lt;ref name="number 8"/&gt; It may include feeling detached from other people, self-guilt, and difficulty sleeping. Individuals with PTSD may experience a number of symptoms similar to those experienced in both anxiety and depression.

In addition to the established diagnostic criteria for PTSD, [[Frank Ochberg]] proposed a specific set of victimization symptoms (not formally recognized in diagnostic systems such as the [[Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders|DSM]] or [[International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems|ICD]]) that includes [[shame]], [[self-blame]], obsessive hatred of the person who victimized them alongside conflicting positive feelings toward that person, feeling defiled, being [[sexually inhibited]], despair or resignation to the situation, secondary victimization (described below), and risk of [[victimisation|revictimization]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Ochberg|first1=edited by Frank M.|title=Post-traumatic therapy and victims of violence|date=1988|publisher=Brunner/Mazel|location=New York|isbn=0876304900}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Other===
Additional symptoms of victimization may take on physical or behavioral forms. These may be direct, individual symptoms of victimization, or they may result from the psychological outcomes described above.

====Physical====
The most direct and obvious physical symptoms of victimization are injuries as a result of an aggressive physical action such as assault or sexual victimization. Other physical symptoms that are not a result of injury may be indirectly caused by victimization through psychological or emotional responses. Physical symptoms with a psychological or emotional basis are called [[Psychosomatic medicine|psychosomatic]] symptoms. Common psychosomatic symptoms associated with victimization include headaches, stomachaches and experiencing a higher frequency of illnesses such as colds and sore throats.&lt;ref name="number1"/&gt; Though psychosomatic symptoms are referred to as having psychological causes they have a biological basis as well; stress and other psychological symptoms trigger [[nervous system]] responses such as the release of various chemicals and hormones which then affect biological functioning.&lt;ref name="PTSD"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Singer|first1=edited by Andrew Baum, Tracey A. Revensen, Jerome|title=Handbook of health psychology|date=2010|publisher=Psychology|location=Hove|isbn=9780805864618|edition=2nd}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Behavioral====
Individuals who have been victimized may also exhibit behavioral symptoms after the experience. Some individuals who have been victimized show externalizing (outwardly directed) behaviors. For example, an individual who has not previously acted aggressively toward others may begin to do so as after being victimized, such as when a child who has been bullied begins to bully others. Aggressive behaviors may be associated with PTSD (described above). Externalizing behaviors associated with victimization include hyperactivity, [[hypervigilance]], and attention problems that may resemble [[attention deficit hyperactivity disorder|ADHD]].&lt;ref name="number1"/&gt; Others may exhibit internalizing (inwardly directed) behavioral symptoms. Many internalizing symptoms tend to be more psychological in nature (depression and anxiety are sometimes referred to as internalization), but particular behaviors are indicative of internalization as well.&lt;ref name="number2"/&gt; Internalizing behaviors that have been documented in victimized individuals include withdrawing from social contact and avoidance of people or situations.&lt;ref name="number2"/&gt;

====Substance use====
Drug and alcohol use associated with victimization is sometimes explained as a form of [[self-medication]], or an attempt to alleviate other symptoms resulting from victimization through substance use.&lt;ref name="drinking"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Kaysen|first1=Debra|last2=Atkins|first2=David C.|last3=Simpson|first3=Tracy L.|last4=Stappenbeck|first4=Cynthia A.|last5=Blayney|first5=Jessica A.|last6=Lee|first6=Christine M.|last7=Larimer|first7=Mary E.|title=Proximal relationships between PTSD symptoms and drinking among female college students: Results from a daily monitoring study.|journal=Psychology of Addictive Behaviors|date=2014|volume=28|issue=1|pages=62–73|doi=10.1037/a0033588|pmc=3825767}}&lt;/ref&gt; Supporting this, alcohol use has been empirically connected to particular symptoms of posttraumatic stress disorder.&lt;ref name="drinking"/&gt; Sexual abuse in particular has been identified as one significant precursor to serious alcohol use among women, although it is not as well-established as a causal link and may be mediated by PTSD or other psychological symptoms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Moncrieff|first1=Joanna|last2=Farmer|first2=Roger|title=Sexual abuse and the subsequent development of alcohol problems|journal=Alcohol and Alcoholism|date=1998|volume=33|issue=6|pages=592–601|doi=10.1093/alcalc/33.6.592}}&lt;/ref&gt; Connections have been established between victimization and the use of other drugs as well. Drug use in adolescence and peer victimization based on sexual orientation are correlated.&lt;ref name="SOV"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Darwich|first1=Lina|last2=Hymel|first2=Shelley|last3=Waterhouse|first3=Terry|title=School avoidance and substance use among lesbian, gay, bisexual, and questioning youths: The impact of peer victimization and adult support.|journal=Journal of Educational Psychology|date=2012|volume=104|issue=2|pages=381–392|doi=10.1037/a0026684}}&lt;/ref&gt; Research has drawn connections between substance use and childhood physical abuse in the general population.&lt;ref name="Malinosky"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Malinosky-Rummell|first1=Robin|last2=Hansen|first2=David J.|title=Long-term consequences of childhood physical abuse.|journal=Psychological Bulletin|date=1993|volume=114|issue=1|pages=68–79|doi=10.1037/0033-2909.114.1.68|pmid=8346329}}&lt;/ref&gt; Drug use has also been connected to both physical and sexual victimization among high risk, incarcerated youth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Dembo|first1=Richard|last2=Dertke|first2=Max|last3=La Voie|first3=Lawrence|last4=Borders|first4=Scott|last5=Washburn|first5=Mark|last6=Schmeidler|first6=James|title=Physical abuse, sexual victimization and illicit drug use: A structural analysis among high risk adolescents|journal=Journal of Adolescence|date=March 1987|volume=10|issue=1|pages=13–34|doi=10.1016/S0140-1971(87)80030-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Types==
Specific types of victimization have been strongly linked to particular symptoms or outcomes. These symptoms are not exclusively associated with these forms of victimization but have been studied in association with them, possibly because of their relevance to the specific victimization experiences.

===Sexual===
Some individuals who have experienced victimization may have difficulty establishing and maintaining [[intimate relationships]].&lt;ref name="PTSD"/&gt; This is not a subset of symptoms that is exclusive to sexual victimization, but the link between sexual victimization and intimacy problems has been particularly well-established in research. These difficulties may include sexual dysfunction, anxiety about sexual relationships, and dating aggression.&lt;ref name="number3"/&gt; Those who experience sexual victimization may have these difficulties long-term, as in the case of victimized children who continue to have difficulty with intimacy during adolescence and adulthood.&lt;ref name="number3"/&gt; Some research suggests that the severity of these intimacy problems is related directly to the severity of victimization, while other research suggests that self-blame and shame about sexual victimization mediates (causes) the relationship between victimization and outcomes.&lt;ref name="number3"/&gt;

===Childhood bullying===
One symptom that has been associated particularly with school-based peer victimization is poor academic functioning.&lt;ref name="number9"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Liu|first1=Junsheng|last2=Bullock|first2=Amanda|last3=Coplan|first3=Robert J.|title=Predictive relations between peer victimization and academic achievement in Chinese children.|journal=School Psychology Quarterly|date=2014|volume=29|issue=1|pages=89–98|doi=10.1037/spq0000044}}&lt;/ref&gt; This symptom is not exclusive to peer victimization, but is contextually relevant due to the setting in which such victimization takes place. Studies have shown poor academic functioning to be a result of peer victimization in elementary, middle, and high school in multiple countries.&lt;ref name="number9"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Schwartz|first1=David|last2=Gorman|first2=Andrea Hopmeyer|last3=Nakamoto|first3=Jonathan|last4=Toblin|first4=Robin L.|title=Victimization in the Peer Group and Children's Academic Functioning.|journal=Journal of Educational Psychology|date=2005|volume=97|issue=3|pages=425–435|doi=10.1037/0022-0663.97.3.425}}&lt;/ref&gt; Though academic functioning has commonly been studied in relation to childhood bullying that takes place in schools, it is likely associated with other forms of victimization as well, as both depression and anxiety affect attention and focus.&lt;ref name="number 8"/&gt;

===Childhood physical abuse===
Researchers have drawn connections between childhood physical abuse and tendencies toward violent or aggressive behaviors both during childhood and later in life.&lt;ref name="Malinosky"/&gt; This aligns logically with increases in aggression and reactivity described above (see psychological symptoms section). The increased risk for engaging in aggressive behavior may be an indirect symptom, mediated by changes in the way that individuals process social information.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Dodge|first1=K.|last2=Bates|first2=J.|last3=Pettit|first3=G.|title=Mechanisms in the cycle of violence|journal=Science|date=21 December 1990|volume=250|issue=4988|pages=1678–1683|doi=10.1126/science.2270481}}&lt;/ref&gt; Increased risk does not mean that everyone who was physically victimized during childhood will continue the cycle of violence with their own children or engage in aggressive behaviors to a point that it is highly detrimental or requires legal action; estimated numbers of individuals who do continue this pattern vary based on the type of aggressive behavior being studied. For example, 16-21% of abused and/or neglected children in one particular study were arrested for violent offenses by around the age of 30.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Maxfield|first1=Michael G.|title=The Cycle of Violence|journal=Archives of Pediatrics &amp; Adolescent Medicine|date=1 April 1996|volume=150|issue=4|pages=390|doi=10.1001/archpedi.1996.02170290056009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Moderating factors==
In psychology, a [[Moderation (statistics)|moderator]] is a factor that changes the outcome of a particular situation. With regards to victimization, these can take the form of environmental or contextual characteristics, other people’s responses after victimization has occurred, or a victimized person’s internal responses to or views on what they have experienced.

===Attributions===

[[Attribution (psychology)|Attribution]]s about a situation or person refer to where an individual places the blame for an event.  An individual may have a different response to being victimized and exhibit different symptoms if they interpret the victimization as being their own fault, the fault of the perpetrator of the victimization, or the fault of some other external factor.&lt;ref name="number6"/&gt; Attributions also vary by how stable or controllable someone believes a situation to be. Characterological self-blame for victimization (believing that something is one's own fault, that it is a stable characteristic about themselves, and that it is unchangeable or out of their control) has been shown to make victims feel particularly helpless and to have a negative effect on psychological outcomes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Graham|first1=Sandra|last2=Bellmore|first2=Amy|last3=Nishina|first3=Adrienne|last4=Juvonen|first4=Jaana|title="It Must Be Me": Ethnic Diversity and Attributions for Peer Victimization in Middle School|journal=Journal of Youth and Adolescence|date=7 January 2009|volume=38|issue=4|pages=487–499|doi=10.1007/s10964-008-9386-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; While self-blaming attributions have potentially harmful moderating effects on the symptoms of victimization for those who are already prone to self-blame, it is worth noting that self-blame may itself be a result of victimization for some individuals as noted above (see [[#Posttraumatic_stress_disorder|section on PTSD]]).&lt;ref name="PTSD"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=D’Andrea|first1=Wendy|last2=Ford|first2=Julian|last3=Stolbach|first3=Bradley|last4=Spinazzola|first4=Joseph|last5=van der Kolk|first5=Bessel A.|author-link5= Bessel van der Kolk|title=Understanding interpersonal trauma in children: Why we need a developmentally appropriate trauma diagnosis.|journal=American Journal of Orthopsychiatry|date=2012|volume=82|issue=2|pages=187–200|doi=10.1111/j.1939-0025.2012.01154.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Coping and help-seeking===

Victimized individuals who participate in active forms of [[coping (psychology)|coping]] experience fewer or less severe psychological symptoms after victimization.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Ford|first1=Julian D.|title=Ethnoracial and educational differences in victimization history, trauma-related symptoms, and coping style.|journal=Psychological Trauma: Theory, Research, Practice, and Policy|date=2012|volume=4|issue=2|pages=177–185|doi=10.1037/a0023670}}&lt;/ref&gt;
One form of active coping is seeking help from others. Help-seeking can be informal (e.g. seeking help from friends or family) or formal (e.g. police reporting of victimization).&lt;ref name="help"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Cuevas|first1=Carlos A.|last2=Bell|first2=Kristin A.|last3=Sabina|first3=Chiara|title=Victimization, psychological distress, and help-seeking: Disentangling the relationship for Latina victims.|journal=Psychology of Violence|date=2014|volume=4|issue=2|pages=196–209|doi=10.1037/a0035819}}&lt;/ref&gt; Attributions about victimization may play a role in whether an individual seeks help or from whom they seek it. For example, a recent study showed that children who are being victimized by peers are less likely to seek support from friends or teachers if they attribute victimization to a group factor such as race, and more likely to seek support if they attribute victimization to more individualized personal characteristics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Visconti|first1=Kari Jeanne|last2=Sechler|first2=Casey M.|last3=Kochenderfer-Ladd|first3=Becky|title=Coping with peer victimization: The role of children’s attributions.|journal=School Psychology Quarterly|date=2013|volume=28|issue=2|pages=122–140|doi=10.1037/spq0000014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, adult victims who blame themselves and are ashamed of being victimized may wish to hide the experience from others, and thus be less willing to seek help.&lt;ref name="number 8"/&gt; Gender may affect willingness seek help as well; men who have been victimized may be less willing to disclose this information and ask for help due to differing societal expectations for men in addition to the shame and stigmatization experienced by both men and women in response to victimization.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Sorsoli|first1=Lynn|last2=Kia-Keating|first2=Maryam|last3=Grossman|first3=Frances K.|title="I keep that hush-hush": Male survivors of sexual abuse and the challenges of disclosure.|journal=Journal of Counseling Psychology|date=2008|volume=55|issue=3|pages=333–345|doi=10.1037/0022-0167.55.3.333}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The increased social support that sometimes results from seeking help may alleviate some of the symptoms of victimization and decrease the risk of continued or future victimization.&lt;ref name="SOV"/&gt; However, seeking help may also make the outcomes and symptoms worse, depending on the context and responses to help-seeking behavior. Help-seeking may be received more positively from some individuals than others; for example, elementary school aged girls who seek social support after victimization may benefit from it socially, while victimized boys of the same age may experience worse social problems as a result of the same support-seeking behaviors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Kochenderfer-Ladd|first1=Becky|last2=Skinner|first2=Karey|title=Children's coping strategies: Moderators of the effects of peer victimization?|journal=Developmental Psychology|date=2002|volume=38|issue=2|pages=267–278|doi=10.1037/0012-1649.38.2.267}}&lt;/ref&gt; Seeking help may also increase the severity of victimization symptoms if an individual experiences [[victimisation|secondary victimization]] in the form of [[victim-blaming]], being forced to mentally relive a victimization experience, or other negative responses from individuals or institutions from whom they seek help.&lt;ref name="PTSD"/&gt; Secondary victimization has been documented in victims of rape when they seek medical or psychological assistance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Campbell|first1=Rebecca|last2=Raja|first2=Sheela|title=THE SEXUAL ASSAULT AND SECONDARY VICTIMIZATION OF FEMALE VETERANS: HELP-SEEKING EXPERIENCES WITH MILITARY AND CIVILIAN SOCIAL SYSTEMS|journal=Psychology of Women Quarterly|date=March 2005|volume=29|issue=1|pages=97–106|doi=10.1111/j.1471-6402.2005.00171.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has also been documented in individuals whose victimization results in criminal trials, particularly if the outcomes of those trials were not in the victims' favor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Orth|first1=Uli|title=Secondary Victimization of Crime Victims by Criminal Proceedings|journal=Social Justice Research|date=2002|volume=15|issue=4|pages=313–325|doi=10.1023/A:1021210323461}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''three poisons''' (Sanskrit: ''triviṣa''; Tibetan: ''dug gsum'') or the '''three unwholesome roots''' (Sanskrit: ''akuśala-mūla''; Pāli: ''akusala-mūla''), in [[Buddhism]], refer to the three root [[Kleshas (Buddhism)|kleshas]] of ''[[Moha (Buddhism)|Moha]]'' (delusion, confusion), ''[[Raga (Buddhism)|Raga]]'' (greed, sensual attachment), and ''[[Dvesha (Buddhism)|Dvesha]]'' (aversion, ill will).&lt;ref name=buswelllopezmoha&gt;{{cite book|author1=Robert E.

==Brief description==
In the [[Buddhist]] teachings, the three poisons (of ignorance, attachment, and aversion) are the primary causes that keep sentient beings trapped in [[Saṃsāra (Buddhism)|samsara]]. These three poisons are said to be the root of all of the other [[Kleshas (Buddhism)|kleshas]].&lt;ref&gt;Daniel Goleman (2003), pages 106, 111&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Khenchen Konchog Gyaltshen (2010), p. 451.&lt;/ref&gt;

The three poisons are represented in the hub of the [[bhavacakra|wheel of life]] as a pig, a bird, and a snake (representing ignorance, attachment, and aversion, respectively).&lt;ref name=davidloyp28&gt;{{cite book|author=David Loy |title=The Great Awakening: A Buddhist Social Theory |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=mwF6-sgB-UkC |year=2003|publisher=Simon and Schuster |isbn=978-0-86171-366-0 |pages=28 }}&lt;/ref&gt; As shown in the [[bhavacakra|wheel of life]] (Sanskrit: ''bhavacakra''), the three poisons lead to the creation of [[karma]], which leads to rebirth in the six realms of samsara.&lt;ref name=buswelllopezmoha/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=David Webster |title=The Philosophy of Desire in the Buddhist Pali Canon |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=GLPGFoLED7sC |year=2005|publisher=Routledge |isbn=978-0-415-34652-8 |pages=100–105, 177, 236}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Dalai Lama (1992), p. 4, 42&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sanskrit/Pali/Tibetan terms and translations==
The three kleshas of ignorance, attachment and aversion are referred to as the ''three poisons'' (Skt. ''triviṣa''; Tibetan: ''dug gsum'')  in the [[Mahayana]] tradition and as the ''three unwholesome roots'' (Pāli, ''akusala-mūla''; Skt. ''akuśala-mūla'' )  in the [[Theravada]] tradition.

The Sanskrit, Pali, and Tibetan terms for each of the three poisons are as follows:

In the Mahayana tradition ''[[Moha (Buddhism)|moha]]'' is identified as a subcategory of ''[[Avidya (Buddhism)|avidya]]''.  Whereas ''avidya'' is defined as a fundamental ignorance, ''moha'' is defined as delusion, confusion and incorrect beliefs. In the Theravada tradition, ''moha'' and ''avidya'' are equivalent terms, but they are used in different contexts; ''moha'' is used when referring to mental factors, and ''avidya'' is used when referring to the [[Twelve Nidanas|twelve links]].&lt;ref name=buswelllopezmoha&gt;{{cite book|author1=Robert E.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5697">{{Type systems}}
In [[computing]], a '''unique type''' guarantees that an object is used in a [[single-threaded]] way, with at most a single reference to it. If a value has a unique type, a function applied to it can be [[Compiler optimization|optimized]] to update the value in-place in the [[object code]]. Such in-place updates improve the efficiency of [[functional language]]s while maintaining [[Referential transparency (computer science)|referential transparency]]. Unique types can also be used to integrate functional and imperative programming.

==Introduction==
Uniqueness typing is best explained using an example. Consider a function &lt;code&gt;readLine&lt;/code&gt; that reads the next line of text from a given file:
  '''function''' readLine(File f) '''returns''' String
      '''return''' line '''where'''
          String line = doImperativeReadLineSystemCall(f)
      '''end'''
  '''end'''

Now &lt;code&gt;doImperativeReadLineSystemCall&lt;/code&gt; reads the next line from the file using an [[operating system|OS]]-level [[system call]] which has the [[Side effect (computer science)|side effect]] of changing the current position in the file. But this violates referential transparency because calling it multiple times with the same argument will return different results each time as the current position in the file gets moved. This in turn makes &lt;code&gt;readLine&lt;/code&gt; violate referential transparency because it calls &lt;code&gt;doImperativeReadLineSystemCall&lt;/code&gt;.

However, using uniqueness typing, we can construct a new version of &lt;code&gt;readLine&lt;/code&gt; that is referentially transparent even though it's built on top of a function that's not referentially transparent:
  '''function''' readLine2('''unique''' File f) '''returns''' ('''unique''' File, String)
      '''return''' (differentF, line) '''where'''
          String line = doImperativeReadLineSystemCall(f)
          File differentF = newFileFromExistingFile(f)
      '''end'''
  '''end'''

The &lt;code&gt;unique&lt;/code&gt; declaration specifies that the type of &lt;code&gt;f&lt;/code&gt; is unique; that is to say that &lt;code&gt;f&lt;/code&gt; may never be referred to again by the caller of &lt;code&gt;readLine2&lt;/code&gt; after &lt;code&gt;readLine2&lt;/code&gt; returns, and this restriction is enforced by the [[type system]]. And since &lt;code&gt;readLine2&lt;/code&gt; does not return &lt;code&gt;f&lt;/code&gt; itself but rather a new, different file object &lt;code&gt;differentF&lt;/code&gt;, this means that it's impossible for &lt;code&gt;readLine2&lt;/code&gt; to be called with &lt;code&gt;f&lt;/code&gt; as an argument ever again, thus preserving referential transparency while allowing for side effects to occur.

==Programming languages==
Uniqueness types are implemented in the functional programming languages [[Clean (programming language)|Clean]], [[Mercury (programming language)|Mercury]] and [[Idris (programming_language)|Idris]]. They are sometimes used for doing [[I/O]] operations in functional languages in lieu of [[Monads in functional programming|monad]]s.

A compiler extension has been developed for the [[Scala (programming language)|Scala programming language]] which uses annotations to handle uniqueness in the context of message passing between actors.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|last1=Haller|first1=P.|last2=Odersky|first2=M.|authorlink2=Martin Odersky|year=2010|contribution=Capabilities for uniqueness and borrowing|title=ECOOP 2010—Object-Oriented Programming|pages=354–378|url=http://lampwww.epfl.ch/~phaller/doc/capabilities-uniqueness2.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Relationship to linear typing==
A unique type is very similar to a [[linear type]], to the point that the terms are often used interchangeably, but there is in fact a distinction: actual linear typing allows a non-linear value to be [[Type casting (computer programming)|typecast]] to a linear form, while still retaining multiple references to it. Uniqueness guarantees that a value has no other references to it, while linearity guarantees that no more references can be made to a value.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference |first=Philip |last=Wadler |authorlink=Philip Wadler |title=Is there a use for linear logic? |conference=ACM SIGPLAN symposium on partial evaluation and semantics-based program manipulation (PEPM '91) |date=17–19 June 1991 |url=http://homepages.inf.ed.ac.uk/wadler/topics/linear-logic.html#linearuse |pages=255–273 |doi=10.1145/115865.115894 |isbn=0-89791-433-3 |citeseerx=10.1.1.26.4202}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Volunteering''' is generally considered an [[altruistic]] activity where an individual or group provides services for no financial or social gain "to benefit another person, group or organization".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Wilson|first1=John|title=Volunteering|journal=Annual Review of Sociology|date=2000|issue=26|page=215|doi=10.1146/annurev.soc.26.1.215|url=http://www.annualreviews.org/doi/10.1146/annurev.soc.26.1.215|accessdate=12 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Volunteering is also renowned for skill development and is often intended to promote goodness or to improve human [[quality of life]]. Volunteering may have positive benefits for the volunteer as well as for the person or community served.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Benefits of Volunteering|url=http://nationalservice.gov|accessdate=12 April 2017|website=[[Corporation for National and Community Service]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is also intended to make contacts for possible employment. Many volunteers are specifically trained in the areas they work, such as [[medicine]], [[education]], or [[emergency rescue]]. Others serve on an as-needed basis, such as in response to a [[natural disaster]].

==Etymology and history==

The verb was first recorded in 1755. It was derived from the noun ''volunteer'', in [[Circa|C]].1600, "one who offers himself for military service," from the [[Middle French]] ''voluntaire''.&lt;ref name="Etymology"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=volunteer|title=Etymology:VOLUNTEER|accessdate=2012-04-30|publisher=Online Etymology Dictionary}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the non-military sense, the word was first recorded during the 1630s. The word ''volunteering'' has more recent usage—still predominantly military—coinciding with the phrase ''community service''.&lt;ref name="Etymology" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://jocote.org/2010/12/volunteer-whats-in-a-word/|publisher=Jocote.org|accessdate=2012-04-30|title=The origin of the word "Volunteering"}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In a military context, a [[volunteer military|volunteer army]] is a military body whose soldiers chose to enter service, as opposed to having been conscripted. Such volunteers do not work "for free" and are given regular pay.

===19th century===
During this time, America experienced the [[Great Awakening]]. People became aware of the disadvantaged and realized the cause for movement against slavery. Younger people started helping the needy in their communities {{citation needed|reason=no citation|date=September 2015}}. In 1851, the first [[YMCA]] in the United States was started, followed seven years later by the first [[YWCA]]. During the [[American Civil War]], women volunteered their time to sew supplies for the soldiers and the "Angel of the Battlefield" [[Clara Barton]] and a team of volunteers began providing aid to servicemen.  Barton founded the [[American Red Cross]] in 1881 and began mobilizing volunteers for disaster relief operations, including relief for victims of the [[Johnstown Flood]] in 1889.

===20th and 21st centuries===
[[File:Kennedy greeting Peace Corps volunteers, 1961.jpg|thumb|[[John F. Kennedy]] greets volunteers on 28 August 1961]]

The [[Salvation Army]] is one of the oldest and largest organizations working for disadvantaged people. Though it is a [[charity organization]], it has organized a number of volunteering programs since its inception.&lt;ref name="ISBN" /&gt;
Prior to the 19th century, few formal charitable organizations existed to assist people in need.

In the first few decades of the 20th century, several volunteer organizations were founded, including the [[Rotary International]], [[Kiwanis International]], [[Association of Junior Leagues International]], and [[Lions Clubs International]].

[[The Great Depression]] saw one of the first large-scale, nationwide efforts to coordinate volunteering for a specific need. During World War II, thousands of volunteer offices supervised the volunteers who helped with the many needs of the military and the [[home front]], including collecting supplies, entertaining soldiers on leave, and caring for the injured.&lt;ref name="ISBN" /&gt;

After [[World War II]], people shifted the focus of their altruistic passions to other areas, including helping the poor and volunteering overseas. A major development was the [[Peace Corps]] in the United States in 1960. When President [[Lyndon B. Johnson]] declared a ''War on Poverty'' in 1964, volunteer opportunities started to expand and continued into the next few decades. The process for finding volunteer work became more formalized, with more volunteer centers forming and new ways to find work appearing on the [[World Wide Web]].&lt;ref name="ISBN"&gt;{{ISBN|1-86287-376-3}}, Volunteers and Volunteering, The Federation Press&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the Corporation for National and Community Service (in 2012), about 64.5 million Americans, or 26.5 percent of the adult population, gave 7.9 billion hours of volunteer service worth $175 billion.  This calculates at about 125–150 hours per year or 3 hours per week at a rate of $22 per hour. Volunteer hours in the UK are similar; the data for other countries is unavailable.

In 1960, after the so called revolutionary war in Cuba ended, Ernesto Che Guevara created the concept of volunteering work. It was created with the intention that workers across the country volunteer a few hours of work on their work centers.

==Types==

=== Volunteering as utilized by service learning programs ===
Many schools on all education levels offer [[service-learning]] programs, which allow students to serve the community through volunteering while earning educational credit.&lt;ref name="MedEdH"&gt;{{Cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Alexander Astin in the foreword to ''Where's the Learning in Service-Learning?'' by Janet Eyler and Dwight E. Giles, Jr.,"...we promote more wide-spread adoption of service-learning in higher education because we see it as a powerful means of preparing students to become more caring and responsible parents and citizens and of helping colleges and universities to make good on their pledge to 'serve society.'"&lt;ref name="Eyler"&gt;{{Citation

    }}&lt;/ref&gt; When describing service learning, the Medical Education at Harvard says, "Service learning unites academic study and volunteer community service in mutually reinforcing ways. ...service learning is characterized by a relationship of partnership: the student learns from the service agency and from the community and, in return, gives energy, intelligence, commitment, time and skills to address human and community needs."&lt;ref name="MedEdH" /&gt; Volunteering in service learning seems to have the result of engaging both mind and heart, thus providing a more powerful learning experience; according to Janet Eyler and Dwight E. Giles, it succeeds by the fact that it "...fosters student development by capturing student interest..."&lt;ref name=Eyler /&gt;{{rp|1–2,8}} While not recognized by everyone as a legitimate approach, research on the efficacy of service learning has grown.&lt;ref name=Eyler /&gt;{{rp|xv-xvii}} Janet Eyler and Dwight E. Giles conducted a national study of American college students to ascertain the significance of service learning programs,&lt;ref name=Eyler /&gt;{{rp|xvi}} According to Eyler and Giles,"These surveys, conducted before and after a semester of community service, examine the impact of service-learning on students."&lt;ref name=Eyler /&gt;{{rp|xvi}} They describe their experience with students involved in service-learning in this way: "Students like service-learning. When we sit down with a group of students to discuss service-learning experiences, their enthusiasm is unmistakable. ...it is clear that [the students]believe that what they gain from service-learning differs qualitatively from what they often derive from more traditional instruction."&lt;ref name=Eyler /&gt;{{rp|1–2}}

===Skills-based volunteering===
''Skills-based volunteering'' is leveraging the specialized skills and the talents of individuals to strengthen the infrastructure of nonprofits, helping them build and sustain their capacity to successfully achieve their missions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nationalserviceresources.org/sbv|publisher=National Service Resources|title=Need of skills based volunteering for Non-Profit activities}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is in contrast to traditional volunteering, where specific training is not required.{{citation needed|date=July 2014}}  The average hour of traditional volunteering is valued by the Independent Sector at between $18–20 an hour.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.i-to-i.com/personal-development-through-volunteering&lt;/ref&gt; Skills-based volunteering is valued at $40–500 an hour, depending on the market value of the time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.independentsector.org|title=Skills based volunteering|publisher=Independent Sector|accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{failed verification|date=July 2014&lt;!-- the link is to a site's home page, please link to the specific page that backs up the claim --&gt;}}

===Volunteering in developing countries===
{{Further information|International volunteering}}
[[File:Laura Bush with Ghana Peace Corps volunteers.jpg|thumb|[[Laura Bush]] poses with [[Peace Corps]] volunteers]]
An increasingly popular form of volunteering among young people, particularly [[gap year]] students and graduates, is to travel to communities in the [[developing world]] to work on projects with local organisations. Activities include teaching English, working in orphanages, conservation, assisting non-governmental organizations and medical work. International volunteering often aims to give participants valuable skills and knowledge in addition to benefits to the host community and organization.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Volunteering abroad|url=http://bma.org.uk/developing-your-career/career-progression/volunteering-abroad|website=BMA|accessdate=15 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Virtual volunteering===
{{Further information|Virtual volunteering}}
Also called ''e-volunteering'' or ''online volunteering'', virtual volunteering is a volunteer who completes tasks, in whole or in part, offsite from the organization being assisted. They use the Internet and a home, school, [[telecenter]] or work computer, or other Internet-connected device, such as a [[PDA]] or [[smartphone]]. Virtual volunteering is also known as cyber service, telementoring, and teletutoring, as well as various other names. Virtual volunteering is similar to [[telecommuting]], except that instead of online employees who are paid, these are online volunteers who are not paid.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.onlinevolunteering.org/en/index.html|publisher=UN Volunteers|accessdate=2012-04-30|title=Online Volunteering|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120502044205/http://onlinevolunteering.org/en/index.html|archive-date=2 May 2012|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.serviceleader.org/virtual|title=Virtual Volunteering|accessdate=2012-04-30|publisher=Service Leader}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Micro-volunteering===
{{Further information|Micro-volunteering}}
Micro-volunteering is a task performed via an internet-connected device. An individual typically does this task in small, un-paid increments of time. Micro-volunteering is distinct from "virtual volunteering" in that it typically does not require the individual volunteer to go through an application process, screening process, or training period.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nonprofit.about.com/od/volunteers/a/microvol.htm| title=Micro-Volunteering via Mobile Phones - Using Spare Time to Micro-Volunteer|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.i-volunteer.org.uk/helpfromhome/micro-volunteering-changing-the-world-in-just-your-pyjamas/ |title=Micro Volunteering - Changing The World In Just Your Pyjamas! |publisher=I-volunteer.org.uk |date= |accessdate=2013-09-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Environmental volunteering===
{{Further information|Environmental volunteering}}

Environmental volunteering refers to the volunteers who contribute towards environmental management or conservation. Volunteers conduct a range of activities including environmental monitoring, ecological restoration such as re-vegetation and weed removal, protecting endangered animals, and educating others about the natural environment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.peacecorps.gov/index.cfm?shell=learn.whatvol|title=Environmental Volunteer Work|publisher=PeaceCorps|accessdate=2012-04-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Volunteering in an emergency===
[[File:FEMA - 15322 - Photograph by Andrea Booher taken on 09-05-2005 in Texas.jpg|thumb|Volunteers assist survivors at the Houston Astrodome following [[Hurricane Katrina]] in September 2005.]]
Volunteering often plays a pivotal role in the recovery effort following natural disasters, such as tsunamis, floods, droughts, hurricanes, and earthquakes. For example, the 1995 [[Great Hanshin earthquake|Great Hanshin-Awaji earthquake]] in Japan was a watershed moment, bringing in many first-time [[wikipedia:Great_Hanshin_earthquake#Volunteerism|volunteers for earthquake response]]. The [[2004 Indian Ocean earthquake and tsunami]] attracted a large number of volunteers worldwide, deployed by [[non-governmental organization]]s, government agencies, and the [[United Nations]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://earthquake.usgs.gov/earthquakes/eqinthenews/2004/usslav/#summary/|publisher=United States Geological Survey|title=USGS Tsunami 2004 Summary|access-date=11 September 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110119233314/http://earthquake.usgs.gov/earthquakes/eqinthenews/2004/usslav/#summary/|archive-date=19 January 2011|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nationalgeographic.com/adventure/0504/excerpt2.html|publisher=National Geographic|title=Emergency Volunteering Coverage in NatGeo.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the 2012 hurricane Sandy emergency, [[Occupy Sandy]] volunteers, formed a ''laterally organized rapid-response team'' that provided much needed help during and after the storm, from food to shelter to reconstruction.  It is an example of [[Mutualism (economic theory)|mutualism]] at work, pooling resources and assistance and leveraging social media.

===Volunteering in schools===

Resource poor schools around the world rely on government support or on efforts from volunteers and private donations, in order to run effectively. In some countries, whenever the economy is down, the need for volunteers and resources increases greatly.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.greatschools.net/news/back-to-school-poll-results.page|title=The Economy's Impact on Back to School|publisher=Great Schools|date=2009-08-06|accessdate=2009-11-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are many opportunities available in school systems for volunteers. Yet, there are not many requirements in order to volunteer in a school system. Whether one is a high school or TEFL (Teaching English as a Foreign Language) graduate or college student, most schools require just voluntary and selfless effort.&lt;ref name="School Mental Health Project"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://smhp.psych.ucla.edu/pdfdocs/volunteer/volunt.pdf|publisher=School Mental Health Project|title=Volunteer teaching effort can help students to learn better in schools|accessdate=2011-12-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Much like the benefits of any type of volunteering there are great rewards for the volunteer, student, and school. In addition to intangible rewards, volunteers can add relevant experience to their resumes. Volunteers who travel to assist may learn foreign culture and language.

Volunteering in schools can be an additional teaching guide for the students and help to fill the gap of local teachers. Cultural and language exchange during teaching and other school activities can be the most essential learning experience for both students and volunteers.&lt;ref name="School Mental Health Project"/&gt;

===Corporate volunteering===
{{Further information|Volunteer grant}}
Benefacto, a volunteering brokerage, describe corporate volunteering as "Companies giving their employees an allowance of paid time off annually, which they use to volunteer at a charity of their choice."&lt;ref&gt;http://benefacto.org/what-is-corporate-volunteering/&lt;/ref&gt;

A majority of the companies at the [[Fortune 500]] allow their employees to volunteer during work hours. These formalized Employee Volunteering Programs (EVPs), also called Employer Supported Volunteering (ESV), are regarded as a part of the companies' sustainability efforts and their social responsibility activities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bcccc.net/index.cfm?fuseaction=document.showDocumentByID&amp;DocumentID=1308|title=Mapping Success in Employee Volunteering - The Drivers of Effectiveness for Employee Volunteering and Giving Programs and Fortune 500 Performance (2009)|publisher=Boston College Center for Corporate Citizenship 2009|accessdate=2010-04-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; About 40% of Fortune 500 companies provide monetary [[donations]], also known as [[volunteer grant]]s, to nonprofits as a way to recognize employees who dedicate significant amounts of time to volunteering in the community.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.qgiv.com/blog/dos-and-donts-for-volunteers/|title=Fortune 500's monetary donation programs for voluntary service|publisher=Qgiv.com|accessdate=2012-03-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the information from [[VolunteerMatch]], a service that provides Employee Volunteering Program solutions, the key drivers for companies that produce and manage EVPs are building [[brand awareness]] and affinity, strengthening trust and loyalty among consumers, enhancing [[corporate image]] and reputation, improving [[employee retention]], increasing [[workforce productivity|employee productivity]] and loyalty, and providing an effective vehicle to reach strategic goals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.volunteermatch.org/corporations/resources/businesscase.jsp|publisher=VolunteerMatch.org|title= How companies benefit from EVP|accessdate=2010-04-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 2015, David Cameron pledged to give all UK workers employed by companies with more 250 staff mandatory three days’ paid volunteering leave, which if implemented will generate an extra 360 million volunteering hours a year&lt;ref&gt;https://benefacto.org/three-days-paid-volunteering-leave-an-update-from-rob-wilsons-office/&lt;/ref&gt;.

===Community volunteer work===
[[File:Volunteers installing windows at the Sumac Centre.jpg|thumb|Volunteers fit new windows at the [[Sumac Centre]] in [[Nottingham]], [[England]], [[United Kingdom|UK]].]]
Community volunteering refers globally to those who work to improve their local community. This activity commonly occurs through not for profit organizations, local governments and churches; but also encompasses ad-hoc or informal groups such as recreational sports teams.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Winfield|first1=Mark|title=The Essential Volunteer Handbook|publisher=FriesenPress|isbn=978-1-4602-1583-8|url=http://www.markwinfield.ca}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Benefits of community volunteer work ===
There are many proven personal benefits of community volunteerism. Working together with a group of people who have different ethnicity, backgrounds, and views reduces stereotypes. Community volunteerism has also been proven to improve student's academic success.{{cn|date=October 2017}}

According to ''Where's the Learning in Service Learning?'' by Janet Eyler and Dwight E. Giles, immersing oneself into service learning and serving others has many positive effects both academic and personal. Not only does surrounding oneself with new people and learning how to work together as a group help one improve teamwork and relational skills, it reduces stereotypes, increases appreciation of other cultures, and works to allow young people to find others that they relate to.

Eyler and Giles noted that at the beginning and end of a college semester that included three hours of community service a week, students reported a much higher regard for cultural differences. At the end of the semester those who had participated in service-learning were noted as saying that the most important things that they had learned were not to judge others, and to appreciate every type of person because everyone shares some similar key characteristics.

Community volunteer work has proven to be a powerful predictor in students' academic lives and college experience as a whole. Studies have shown that students who participate in community service as a part of their college course of study have a much higher correlation of completing their degree (Astin, 1992;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=What Matters in College: Four Critical Years Revisited|last=Astin|first=A.W.|publisher=Jossey-Bass|year=1992|isbn=|location=San Francisco|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pascarella and Terenzini, 1991&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=How College Affects Students: Findings and Insights from Twenty Years of Research|last=Pascarella and Terenzini|first=E.T. and P.T.|publisher=Jossey-Bass|year=1991|isbn=|location=San Francisco|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;). In addition, college students who participate in community volunteer projects as a part of their college experience report finding a much greater relevance in their academic studies after completing community volunteer projects.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Where's the Learning in Service-Learning|last=Eyler and Giles, Jr.|first=Janet and Dwight|publisher=Jossey-Bass|year=1999|isbn=|location=San Francisco|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to University Health Services, studies have found that volunteering can positively impact a student’s overall mental and emotional health.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.uhs.wisc.edu/wellness/student-volunteering-could-have-health-benefits/|title=Student volunteering could have health benefits|website=www.uhs.wisc.edu|language=en-US|access-date=2018-08-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Social volunteering or welfare volunteering===
In some European countries government organisations and non-government organisations provide auxiliary positions for a certain period in institutions like hospitals, schools, memorial sites and welfare institutions. The difference to other types of volunteering is that there are strict legal regulations, what organisation is allowed to engage volunteers and about the period a volunteer is allowed to work in a voluntary position. Due to that fact, the volunteer is getting a limited amount as a pocket money from the government. An organization having one of the biggest manpower in [[Europe]] is the German [[Federal volunteers service]] (Bundesfreiwilligendienst), that was founded in 2011, by having more than 35.000 federal volunteers in 2012.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.bundesfreiwilligendienst.de/fileadmin/de.bundesfreiwilligendienst/content.de/Service/Downloads/BFD_Flyer_engl_web_RZ.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; A much older institution is the [[Voluntary social year]] (Freiwilliges Soziales Jahr) in [[Austria]] and [[Germany]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.fsj.at/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.pro-fsj.de/&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Volunteering at Major Sporting Events ===
Sochi Olympics 25,000 volunteers worked at the [[2014 Winter Olympics|2014 Sochi Winter Olympics]]. They supported the organisers in more than 20 functional areas: meeting guests, assisting navigation, organising the opening and closing ceremonies, organising food outlets, etc. Volunteer applications were open to any nationals of Russia and other countries. The Sochi 2014 Organising Committee received about 200,000 applications, 8 applicants per place. Volunteers received training over the course of more than a year at 26 volunteer centres in 17 cities across Russia. The majority of participants were between 17 and 22 years old. At the same time, 3000 applications were submitted from people over 55 years old. Some of them worked as volunteers during the [[1980 Summer Olympics|1980 Olympics]] in Moscow. It was the first experience with such a large-scale volunteer program in the contemporary Russia.

==== 2017 FIFA Confederations Cup and 2018 FIFA World Cup in Russia ====
For the first time in its history, Russia will host the FIFA World Cup from June 14 till July 15, 2018. Moreover, it will be the first time the World Cup games will be played both in Europe and Asia. The games will be hosted by 12 stadiums in 11 Russian cities.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://ru.fifa.com/worldcup/organisation/volunteers/|title=Чемпионат мира по футболу FIFA 2018 в России™ - Волонтерская программа Чемпионата мира по футболу FIFA 2018 в России™ - FIFA.com|last=FIFA.com|work=www.fifa.com|access-date=2018-06-14|language=ru-RU}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The volunteer program of the 2018 FIFA World Cup has engaged thousands of people from Russia and other countries around the world.

The program included several stages: recruitment, selection and training of volunteers, organisation of their work during the championship. The recruitment of volunteers for the FIFA Confederations Cup and the FIFA World Cup via FIFA.com started on June 1, 2016 and closed on December 30, 2016. Some of the volunteers worked at the [[2017 FIFA Confederations Cup]]: 1733 people assisted the organisers in Saint Petersburg, 1590 worked in Moscow, 1261 in Sochi, 1260 in Kazan, a total of 5844 participants.

The FIFA World Cup will be supported by 17,040 volunteers of the Russia 2018 Local Organising Committee.

Candidates living in Russia were selected by 15 volunteer centres in the host cities based in some of Russia's leading higher educational institutions: Synergy University, Moscow State Institute of International Relations, Plekhanov Russian University of Economics, Russian State Social University, Moscow Automobile and Road Construction University, Saint Petersburg State University of Economics, Samara State University, Volga Region State Academy of Physical Culture, Sport and Tourism, Don State Technical University, Ogarev Mordovia State University, Volgograd State University, State University of Nizhny Novgorod, Samara State Aerospace University, Immanuel Kant Baltic Federal University, and Ural Federal University.

Candidates from other countries were selected remotely.

Candidates had to be at least 18 years old, have a good knowledge of English, have a higher or vocational secondary education, and possess teamwork skills.

Volunteers were trained remotely, in volunteer centres and at World Cup venues.

Volunteers will be providing assistance in a variety of areas:

# Distributing accreditations;
# Selling and checking tickets;
# Assisting radio communications professionals;
# Organising leisure and entertainment activities for guests of the event;
# Organising food outlets;
# Providing interpretation services;
# Working with sponsors;
# Providing medical services and organising doping control procedures;
# Supporting mass media operations;
# Organising arrivals and departures of players and guests;
# Working with VIP guests;
# Assisting players and referees;
# Assisting players and guests with accommodation;
# Providing navigation assistance to guests;
# Assisting TV and radio broadcasting;
# Organising transportation;
# Managing volunteers;
# Organising operations of the stadium;
# Monitoring compliance with FIFA social and environmental requirements;
# Organising the opening and closing ceremonies of the championship.

Their work started ahead of the events: on May 10, 2017 for the 2017 FIFA Confederations Cup, and on May 10, 2018 for the 2018 FIFA World Cup.

==== Legacy of 2018 FIFA World Cup Volunteer Program: Russian National Competition of Important Social Projects ====
On October 20, 2017, the Russian National Competition of Important Social Projects “Legacy of 2018 FIFA World Cup Volunteer Program” was launched. The competition has engaged about 1500 people: applicants to the 2018 FIFA World Cup volunteer program and future city volunteers.

The idea of the competition was that anyone could submit a project that would draw the attention of Russian cities residents to the FIFA World Cup in Russia and leave a legacy after the championship was over.

The project was expected to produce tangible (work of art, place of attraction for guests and residents in the city, open playground, graffiti, developed areas in city parks, films, etc.) or intangible (events, conferences, festivals, exhibitions) legacy.

26 projects qualified to the final and were supported by the Russia 2018 Local Organising Committee and the host cities of the 2018 FIFA World Cup. The jury included the General Director of the Russia 2018 Local Organising Committee Alexey Sorokin, Ambassador of the 2018 FIFA World Cup in Russia Alexey Smertin and Advisor to the Head of the Federal Tourism Agency Svetlana Sergeeva.

Some of the projects were combined or further developed by the Local Organising Committee.

Among the projects were: Football Championship for Moms, Ramp Production out of Recycled Plastic, Your Championship Sticker Packs, etc.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://ru.fifa.com/worldcup/news/%D0%BF%D0%BE%D0%B1%D0%B5%D0%B4%D0%B8%D1%82%D0%B5%D0%BB%D0%B8-%D0%BA%D0%BE%D0%BD%D0%BA%D1%83%D1%80%D1%81%D0%B0-%D0%BD%D0%B0%D1%81%D0%BB%D0%B5%D0%B4%D0%B8%D0%B5-%D0%B2%D0%BE%D0%BB%D0%BE%D0%BD%D1%82%D0%B5%D1%80%D1%81%D0%BA%D0%BE%D0%B8-%D0%BF%D1%80%D0%BE%D0%B3%D1%80%D0%B0%D0%BC%D0%BC%D1%8B-%D1%87%D0%BC-2018-%D0%BD%D0%B0%D0%B3%D1%80%D0%B0%D0%B6%D0%B4%D0%B5%D0%BD%D1%8B-2922854|title=Чемпионат мира по футболу FIFA 2018 в России™ - Новости - Победители конкурса «Наследие волонтерской программы ЧМ-2018» награждены в «Сколково» - FIFA.com|last=FIFA.com|work=www.fifa.com|access-date=2018-06-14|language=ru-RU}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Political view==
{{Further information|Gift economy}}
Modern societies share a common value of people helping each other; not only do volunteer acts assist others, but they also benefit the volunteering individual on a personal level.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.picketnews.com/archiveDetail.asp?cID=3&amp;id=8327|publisher=Picket News&lt;/ref&gt; Despite having similar objectives, tension can arise between volunteers and state-provided services. In order to curtail this tension, most countries develop policies and enact legislation to clarify the roles and relationships among governmental stakeholders and their voluntary counterparts; this regulation identifies and allocates the necessary legal, social, administrative, and financial support of each party. This is particularly necessary when some voluntary activities are seen as a challenge to the authority of the state(e.g., on 29 January 2001, President Bush cautioned that volunteer groups should supplement—not replace—government agencies’ work).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.policyalmanac.org/government/charity_and_volunteering.shtml Bush Announces Faith-Based Initiative]&lt;/ref&gt;

Volunteering that benefits the state but challenges paid counterparts angers labor unions that represent those who are paid for their volunteer work; this is particularly seen in combination departments, such as [[volunteer fire department]]s.

===Difficulties in cross-national aid===
{{see also|International volunteering}}
Difficulties in the cross-national aid model of volunteering can arise when it is applied across national borders. The presence of volunteers who are sent from one state to another can be viewed as a breach of [[sovereignty]] and showing a lack of respect towards the national government of the proposed recipients. Thus, motivations are important when states negotiate offers to send aid and when these proposals are accepted, particularly if donors may postpone assistance or stop it altogether. Three types of conditionality have evolved:
#'''Financial accountability''': Transparency in funding management to ensure that what is done by the volunteers is properly targeted
#'''Policy reform''': Governmental request that developing countries adopt certain social, economic, or environmental policies; often, the most controversial relate to the privatization of services traditionally offered by the state
#'''Development objectives''': Asking developing countries to adjust specific time-bound economic objectives

Some international volunteer organizations define their primary mission as being altruistic: to fight poverty and improve the living standards of people in the developing world, (e.g. [[Voluntary Services Overseas]] has almost 2,000 skilled professionals working as volunteers to pass on their expertise to local people so that the volunteers' skills remain long after they return home). When these organizations work in partnership with governments, the results can be impressive. However, when other organizations or individual First World governments support the work of volunteer groups, there can be questions as to whether the organizations' or governments' real motives are poverty alleviation. Instead, a focus on creating wealth for some of the poor or developing policies intended to benefit the donor states is sometimes reported.&lt;ref&gt;ISBN reference for Volunteering Visions, Publisher: The Federation Press, Edited by: [[Joy Noble]] and [[Fiona Johnston]], {{ISBN|1-86287-404-2}} {{ISBN|978-1862874046}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many low-income countries’ economies suffer from industrialization without prosperity and investment without growth. One reason for this is that development assistance guides many Third World governments to pursue development policies that have been wasteful, ill-conceived, or unproductive; some of these policies have been so destructive that the economies could not have been sustained without outside support.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDS_IBank_Servlet?pcont=details&amp;eid=000009265_3980429111119|title=Aid, taxation, and development: analytical perspectives on aid effectiveness in Sub-Saharan Africa|publisher=World Bank|date=1998-02-28|accessdate=2007-07-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Indeed, some offers of aid have distorted the general spirit of volunteering, treating local voluntary action as contributions in kind, i.e., existing conditions requiring the modification of local people’s behavior in order for them to earn the right to donors’ charity. This can be seen as patronizing and offensive to the recipients because the aid expressly serves the policy aims of the donors rather than the needs of the recipients.

==Moral resources, political capital and civil society==
[[File:Some help files iin a volunteers station in Shenzhen,China .jpg|thumb|250px|right|Some files for helping people in a volunteers station in [[Shenzhen]], [[People's Republic of China]]]]
Based on a case study in China, Xu and Ngai (2011) revealed that the developing grassroots volunteerism can be an enclave among various organizations and may be able to work toward the development of civil society in the developing countries. The researchers developed a "Moral Resources and Political Capital" approach to examine the contributions of volunteerism in promoting the civil society. Moral resource means the available morals could be chosen by NGOs. Political capital means the capital that will improve or enhance the NGOs’ status, possession or access in the existing political system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Xu |first1=Y |last2=Ngai |first2=N. P. |year=2011 |title= Moral Resources and Political Capital: Theorizing the Relationship Between Voluntary Service Organizations and the Development of Civil Society in China |work=Nonprofit and Voluntary Sector Quarterly |volume=40 |issue=2 |pages=247–269.|accessdate=17 April 2011 |url= http://nvs.sagepub.com/content/40/2/247}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Moreover, Xu and Ngai (2011) distinguished two types of Moral Resources: Moral Resource-I and Moral Resource-II (ibid).
#Moral Resource I: Inspired by [[Immanuel Kant]]’s (1998 [1787]) argument of "What ought I to do," Moral Resource-I will encourage the NGOs’ confidence and then have the courage to act and conquer difficulties by way of answering and confirming the question of "What ought I to do."&lt;ref&gt;Kant, I. (1998). Critique of pure reason ([[J. M. D. Meiklejohn]], Trans.). Raleigh, NC: Alex Catalogue.&lt;/ref&gt;
#Moral Resource II: given that Adorno (2000) recognizes that moral or immoral tropes are socially determined, Moral Resource-II refers to the morals that are well accepted by the given society.&lt;ref&gt;Adorno, T. (2000). Problems of moral philosophy (T. Schroder, Ed. &amp; R. Livingstone, Trans.). Stanford, CA: Stanford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

Thanks to the intellectual heritage of Blau and Duncan (1967), two types of political capital were identified:
#Political Capital-I refers to the political capital mainly ascribed to the status that the NGO inherited throughout history (e.g., the CYL).
#Political Capital-II refers to the Political Capital that the NGOs earned through their hard efforts.&lt;ref&gt;Blau, P. M., &amp; Duncan, O. D. (1967). The American occupational structure. New York: Wiley.&lt;/ref&gt;
Obviously, "Moral resource-I itself contains the self-determination that gives participants confidence in the ethical beliefs they have chosen",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Xu |first1=Y |last2=Ngai |first2=N. P. |year=2011 |title= Moral Resources and Political Capital: Theorizing the Relationship Between Voluntary Service Organizations and the Development of Civil Society in China |work=Nonprofit and Voluntary Sector Quarterly |volume=40 |issue=2 |page=260 |accessdate=17 April 2011 |url=http://nvs.sagepub.com/content/40/2/247.abstract}}&lt;/ref&gt; almost any organizations may have Moral Resource-I, while not all of them have the societal recognized Moral Resource-II. However, the voluntary service organizations predominantly occupy Moral Resource-II because a sense of moral superiority makes it possible that for parties with different values, goals and cultures to work together in promoting the promotion of volunteering. Thus the voluntary service organizations are likely to win the trust and support of the masses as well as the government more easily than will the organizations whose morals are not accepted by mainstream society. In other words, Moral Resource II helps the grassroots organizations with little Political Capital I to win Political Capital-II, which is a crucial factor for their survival and growth in developing countries such as China. Therefore, the voluntary service realm could be an enclave of the development of civil society in the developing nations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Xu |first1=Y. |last2= Ngai |first2=N. P. |year=2011 |title= Moral Resources and Political Capital: Theorizing the Relationship Between Voluntary Service Organizations and the Development of Civil Society in China |work=Nonprofit and Voluntary Sector Quarterly |volume=40 |issue=2 |pages=247–269 |accessdate=17 April 2011 |url=http://nvs.sagepub.com/content/40/2/247}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Health benefits==
Volunteering has the ability to improve the quality of life and health including longevity of those who donate their time &lt;ref&gt;https://greatergood.berkeley.edu/images/uploads/Post-AltruismHappinessHealth.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; and research has found that older adults will benefit the most from volunteering. Physical and mental ailments plaguing older adults can be healed through the simple act of helping others; however, one must be performing the good deed from a selfless nature. There are barriers that can prevent older adults from participating in volunteer work, such as socio-economic status, opinions held by others, and even current health issues. However, these barriers can be overcome so that if one would like to be involved in volunteer work they can do so. Volunteering improves not only the communities in which one serves, but also the life of the individual who is providing help to the community.

==Mental health benefits==
Volunteering is known not only to be related to happiness &lt;ref&gt;https://www.researchgate.net/publication/228189802_Prosocial_Spending_and_Well-Being_Cross-Cultural_Evidence_for_a_Psychological_Universal&lt;/ref&gt; but also to increase happiness &lt;ref&gt;https://www.researchgate.net/publication/228189802_Prosocial_Spending_and_Well-Being_Cross-Cultural_Evidence_for_a_Psychological_Universal&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.researchgate.net/publication/5494996_Spending_Money_on_Others_Promotes_Happiness
&lt;/ref&gt;. Also, giving help was a more important benefit of better reported mental health than receiving help &lt;ref&gt;http://img2.timg.co.il/forums/1_89494618.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;. Studies have also shown that volunteering can cause a decrease in  loneliness for those volunteering as well as those for whom people volunteer.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.drbarbaraedwards.com/why-helping-others-makes-us-happy/|title=Why Helping Others Makes Us Happy {{!}} Dr. Barbara Edwards|access-date=2018-06-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Statistics==
In the United States, statistics on volunteering have historically been limited.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.energizeinc.com/hot-topics/2006/june|title=Wouldn't It Be Nice to Really Know {{!}} Energize: Volunteer Management Resources for Directors of Volunteers|website=www.energizeinc.com|access-date=2016-10-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2013, the U.S. [[Current Population Survey (US)]] included a volunteering supplement which produced statistics on volunteering.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.volunteeringinamerica.gov/about/research_faqs.cfm|title=National Veteran Corps|website=www.volunteeringinamerica.gov|access-date=2016-10-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticisms==
In the 1960s, [[Ivan Illich]] offered an analysis of the role of American volunteers in Mexico in his speech entitled "To Hell With Good Intentions". His concerns, along with those of critics such as [[Paulo Freire]] and [[Edward Said]], revolve around the notion of [[altruism]] as an extension of Christian [[missionary]] [[ideology]]. In addition, he mentions the sense of [[Moral responsibility|responsibility]]/[[obligation]] as a factor, which drives the concept of [[noblesse oblige]]—first developed by the French [[aristocracy]] as a [[morality|moral]] [[duty]] derived from their wealth. Simply stated, these apprehensions propose the extension of power and authority over indigenous cultures around the world. Recent critiques of volunteering come from Westmier and Kahn (1996) and [[bell hooks]] (née Gloria Watkins) (2004). Also, [http://www.routledge.com/books/details/9780415809153/ Georgeou (2012)] has critiqued the impact of [[neoliberalism]] on international aid volunteering.

The field of the [[medical tourism]] (referring to volunteers who travel overseas to deliver medical care) has recently attracted negative criticism when compared to the alternative notion of sustainable capacities, i.e., work done in the context of long-term, locally-run, and foreign-supported infrastructures.  A preponderance of this criticism appears largely in scientific and peer-reviewed literature.&lt;ref&gt;Bezruchka, S. (2000). Medical Tourism as Medical Harm to the Third World: Why? For Whom? ''[[Wilderness and Environmental Medicine]]'', 11, 77-78.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Roberts, M. (2006). Duffle Bag Medicine. ''[[Journal of the American Medical Association]]'', 295, 1491-1492.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Pinto, A.D., &amp; Upshur, R.E.G. (2009). Global Health Ethics for Students. ''[[Developing World Bioethics]]'', 9, 1-10.&lt;/ref&gt; Recently, media outlets with more general readerships have published such criticisms as well.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://theconversation.com/think-looking-after-turtles-in-costa-rica-for-three-weeks-is-good-for-your-cv-think-again-66148#comment_1125331|title=Think looking after turtles in Costa Rica for three weeks is good for your CV?
