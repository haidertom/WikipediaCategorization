''500 Years Later'' has received praise as well as controversy, both for the genre of the film (creative documentary), and its social-political impact with relation to race study. The film opened on February 28, 2005, at the Pan-African Awards (PAFF) and won Best Documentary at its premiere. It made its American television premiere on August 23, 2008, on [[TV One (Radio One)]], and [[Ethiopian Television]] premiere on October 27, 2007. It was shown nationally in South Africa on December 14, 2014, on [[SABC 2]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sabc.co.za/Integration/Services/EPG/TVSchedule/SABC2/PressTool/1.0/2014-12-14.html TV Schedule for SABC2], 2014-12-14.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sabc.co.za/Integration/Services/EPG/TVSchedule/SABC2/PressTool/1.0/2014-12-21.html TV Schedule for SABC2], 2014-12-21.&lt;/ref&gt; In 2010, the sequel, ''[[Motherland (2010 film)|Motherland]]'', was released.

==Plot==
''500 Years Later'' studies the [[African diaspora]] and the impact of slavery throughout history, identifying key issues facing the world's black communities, including poor education, poverty, crime, and the way that such issues dehumanize and degrade black peoples. The film also gives insight into the struggles faced by continental Africans today, for instance in terms of poverty, disease, and corrupt governments. While the continuing negative impact, influence and effects of the trans-Atlantic slave trade are highlighted, scholars interviewed for the film express hope that "old scars can be healed" and Africans as a race will advance through education about their history.&lt;ref name="500 Years Later — MK Asante"&gt;{{Cite web|title = 500 Years Later — MK Asante|url = http://mkasante.com/films/500-years-later/|website = mkasante.com|accessdate = 2015-12-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Narrative===
The film states that the lasting effects of slavery are still felt 500 years later, hence the title. This is justified and explained through a series of scholarly interviews throughout the film. The film begins with an adage that illustrates its historical theme: "Until lions tell their story, the tale of the hunt will always glorify the hunter."

The promotional page for the producer of the film describes it thusly: "''500 Years Later'' is a compelling journey, infused with the spirit and music of liberation, that chronicles the struggle of a people from enslavement who continue to fight for the most essential human right - freedom."&lt;ref name="500 Years Later — MK Asante"/&gt; The film presents the richness of African cultures and traditions and how they have evolved since slavery was abolished, emphasizing that prior to the beginning of the Atlantic Slave Trade Africans were free. &lt;!--The images provided in the documentary concerning the slave trade are eye-opening for the audience. --&gt;The film includes testimonies, voices, and opinions gathered around five continents. Many of the people who voice their opinion are scholars or experts on the African diaspora.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://aalbc.com/authors/molefi_kete_asante.htm | title=Molefi Kete Asante, Author, Scholar,  and Historian | accessdate=3 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Those interviewed in the film criticize contemporary rap music as being particularly negative for Africans and their descendants, as they believe it reinforced racist stereotypes that were established in part because of the slave trade.

A lasting example of the stereotypes referenced in the film is a study performed by [[Kenneth and Mamie Clark]] in which black children were given a variety of dolls, including black and white ones, and were told to pick the "smarter" or "better" one. A majority of the black children chose the white dolls. Many of those interviewed believe that a distinct change to the educational system is necessary to change the mindset of people of African descent. The film affirms that "the kind of education that we have is to still enslave our minds, to make us believe we are inferior."&lt;ref name=NeoCopernicanReview /&gt; Education should be the main weapon for the new generations of Africans and African descendants, to remind the world of the richness and struggle of African history.

At the end of the film, Africans are encouraged to remember their past, in order to move forward. The film promotes the idea that making it through enslavement should be a strength, not a weakness or something to be ashamed about; that the people who enslaved the Africans should be the ones that are ashamed. Essentially, the goal proposed is to teach African children a more Afrocentric history, instead of a Eurocentric one. It further argues that teaching African-descent people about a history that is not their own will not help because they cannot relate to it. It also indicates that society must establish and promote African ideas and history in order to preserve what they want for future generations. The film calls for the ideas promoted within it to become mainstream so that there can be a better Africa and a better history associated with the continent.&lt;ref&gt;''500 Years Later''.&lt;/ref&gt;

== UNESCO award ==
{{Slavery}}
''500 Years Later'' was the first film to win a UNESCO award for documenting slavery. And was part of UNESCO slave route project started in 1994: "The prize awarded $10,000 to a film that breaks the silence and speaks to the social, historical, economic and psychological impact of the slave trade; a film that raises public awareness of slavery’s historical and contemporary manifestations; a film that gives voice to the dispossessed, reflects their perspectives and articulates their
resistance to this dehumanization."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.swahiliweb.net/ziff_journal_4_files/ziff2007-14.pdf Swahiliweb.net]&lt;/ref&gt; UNESCO launched the Slave Route Project in 1994. This project wants to increase knowledge and understanding in terms of slavery and historical events related to it. {{citation needed|date=July 2014}}

==Critical reception==
Kingsley Sheteh, from A Neo-Copernican Review, asserts that the film ''500 Years Later'' is a step in the right direction in depicting the relationship between the Western world and Africa, showcasing the historically dependent and underdeveloped status of African countries. Shetah also pointed out that, although the movie did a great job in touching on sensitive issue that are causes for Africa's problems, it is worth mentioning it failed to treat the issue of conflict. Shetah cites reasons that independent African state governments are heavily corrupted due to problems that can't be simply be tied down to ideology, slavery, and colonialism.&lt;ref name=NeoCopernicanReview&gt;{{Cite web|title = 500 Years Later - Time For Africa to Forget...

''500 Years Later'' holds a 6.8/10 rating on IMDb.com from over 150 users.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0444593/|title = 500 Years Later (2005) |accessdate = December 3, 2015|website = IMDB}}&lt;/ref&gt; It also holds an audience approval rating of 88% on rotten tomatoes from over 340 voters, and has an average rating of 4.2 out of 5.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = 500 Years Later|url = http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/500_years_later/|website = www.rottentomatoes.com|date = 2005-02-24|accessdate = 2015-12-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Many critics received the film as a way to explore African history like never before. The film is a compilation of interviews that offer history from the perspective of people whose knowledge has been suppressed for years. "500 Years Later" is applauded for its vast focus on African history, both the good and the bad.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Sheteh|first1=Kingsley|title=500 Years Later-Time for Africa to Forget...A Review|url=https://newuh.wordpress.com/2012/09/24/500-years-later-time-to-forget-a-review/|website=www.newuh.wordpress.com|accessdate=December 3, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite much success, ''500 Years Later'' received mixed reviews from critics regarding content and presentation. Dan Schindel, a documentary reviewer, calls the film "The Malcolm X to the MLK of the average doc that covers African-related material"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Doc of the Day: 500 Years Later Review - Dan Schindel|url = http://danschindel.com/doc-of-the-day-500-years-later/|website = Dan Schindel|accessdate = 2015-12-08|language = en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; and offers many examples of the extremity of the film. An article entitled "Destroying the Horrors of 500 Years" on the African Holocaust website, written by Attahiru Kawu-Bala in 2006, praised the film as an "articulate multi-dimensional African world perspective" with regard to the effects of African Diaspora. Kawu-Bala argued that the techniques used in the documentary did not rely on emotion and instead used facts and truth to build a case from an African standpoint.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = AFRICAN HOLOCAUST {{!}} Destroying the Horrors of 500 Years|url = http://www.africanholocaust.net/news_ah/horror500yearslater.html|website = www.africanholocaust.net|accessdate = 2015-12-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; By contrast, Curt Holman recognized the film's righteousness, but believed "a more informative film would have been more effective." He found the video to be emotionally charged and, at times, overly obvious. According to Holman, the emotional biases sometimes overshadowed the factual content.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Tales from the diaspora|url = http://clatl.com/atlanta/tales-from-the-diaspora/Content?oid=1255107|website = Creative Loafing Atlanta|accessdate = 2015-12-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Wanuri Kahiu]], a Kenyan film director, states that the film is a discussion between the "greatest and most articulate thinkers of the African global nation." In his review of ''500 Years Later'', Kahiu wrote that the documentary should not be referred to as a film but rather an "audiovisual reference book" because of how informative the documentary is. According to Kahiu, ''500 Years Later'' is a good resource to show the challenges people of African descent faced during the Diaspora and slavery and the challenges they still face today.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = 500 Years Later...More than a Film|url = http://www.africanholocaust.net/500/review.pdf|website = African Holocaust|accessdate = 2015-12-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; He further states that the film is a great representation of the strength of African-American culture and citizenry,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.africanholocaust.net/500/review.pdf|title = 500 Years Later...More Than A Movie|date = December 8, 2015|accessdate = |website = African Holocaust|publisher = |last = Kahui|first = Wanuri}}&lt;/ref&gt; and claims that the movie is a call for African people to patiently work to rid the African world of the "defeatist nature" still subconsciously ingrained in them today.

'''Akan art''' is an [[art]] form that originated among the [[Akan people]] of [[West Africa]]. Akan art is known for vibrant artistic traditions, including textiles, sculpture, [[Akan goldweights]], as well as gold and silver [[jewelry]]. The Akan people are known for their strong connection between visual and verbal expressions and a distinctive blending of art and philosophy. Akan culture values [[gold]] above all other metals, so the artwork and jewelry made of gold reflects a great deal of value, whether it be made for appearance, artistic expression, or more practical trading purposes.

==Goldweights==
{{main|Akan goldweights}}
One of the most popular pieces of Akan art are the [[Akan goldweights]]. The gold weights were made of [[copper]], [[bronze]], and [[brass]]. They were cast using a method of casting known as lost-wax technique or "cire perdue". Goldweights were created  for economic transactions involving gold. Although it is not clear when the convention of weights were first introduced, scholars suggest that the Akan first traded gold with Muslim merchants from the West African interior, long before European contact. Their weight system correspond to the Islamic weight system of North Africa, and appear to be part of early sub-Saharan trade. 

The gold weights served a vast amount of roles in their culture and everyday life. Akan goldweights are used as [[counterbalance]]s on the scales used in gold trade, visual representations of oral tradition, representations of proverbs, as pictographic script in social and political system, and in the knowledge system of the Akan people. Goldweights were used in everyday trade and commerce, as well as in accounting, as a type of fraction or counter. According to the Akan scholar Nitecki, Akan gold weights were "created and used like spoken language to commemorate social or historical events or entities, to express philosophical or religious views, aspirations, and dreams, or simply to ask questions, or to express displeasure". The Akan pyramids were concrete testimonials to how the artist felt about themselves and major life events and dilemmas such as marriage, children, injustice, and personal and statewide conflicts.

There are four major categories of gold weights, based on what was depicted. The first kind of gold weights depict people. The second consist of the local flora and fauna. The third category are likened to man-made objects. The final category are abstract and open for interpretation by individual. 

==Jewelry==
Akan cultural jewelry has a variety of forms. The Akan people make neck-wear, wrist bands, elbow-wear, knee-wear, and ankle-wear. Gender-specific jewelry includes hat pins and headbands for men and earrings and hairpins for the women.

'''Alliance Graphique Internationale''' (AGI) is a club of the world’s leading [[graphic artist]]s and [[designer]]s. There are 497 members from 39 countries.  Its members have been collectively responsible for the identity design of most of the world's top corporations and institutions as well as for countless examples of globally known packaging, publications, illustration and posters. [[:fr:Bernard_Baissait|Bernard Baissait]] is the only member who left the AGI following disagreement.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.bernardbaissait.fr/cv.php&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
In 1951 two Swiss and three French graphic artists decided to formalise their relationship into a kind of association. In 1952 the Alliance Graphique Internationale was incorporated in [[Paris]] with 65 members. The first AGI show was in [[Paris]] in 1955. In 1969 the AGI headquarters moved to [[Zürich]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.a-g-i.org/about/about_who.php?show=3 AGI Backwards]&lt;/ref&gt;

The most important events of the organisation are the annual AGI Congress and AGI Open that take place in a different country in each year.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.a-g-i.org/about/about_who.php?show=2 AGI Outwards]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Amar Jawan Jyoti''' ({{lang-hi|अमर जवान ज्योति}}) (English translation: ''Flame of the immortal soldier'') is an Indian [[memorial]] constructed after the [[Indo-Pakistani War of 1971]] to commemorate the martyred and unknown soldiers of the [[Indian Armed Forces]] who died during the war. The memorial was constructed in December 1971 and inaugurated by [[Indira Gandhi]] in 1972. Amar Jawan Jyoti is located under [[India Gate]] at [[Rajpath]] in [[New Delhi]] and consists of a marble pedestal on which a [[cenotaph]] is situated. "Amar Jawan" (Immortal Soldier) is scripted in gold on all four sides of the cenotaph and on top, a [[L1A1 self-loading rifle]] stands on its barrel with a helmet of the Unknown Soldier on top. The pedestal is bound by four urns, one of which holds a continuously burning flame.

==History==
From 3 December 1971 to 16 December 1971 ([[Fall of Dhaka]]), India had a military confrontation with [[Pakistan]] ([[Indo-Pakistani War of 1971]]) during the [[Bangladesh Liberation War|liberation war]] in [[East Pakistan]].&lt;ref name="India-Pakistan 1971 war"&gt;{{cite news|title=India-Pakistan 1971 war|work=[[The Indian Express]]|accessdate=4 January 2017|url=http://indianexpress.com/article/explained/india-pakistan-1971-war-bangladesh-indira-gandhi-4429236/}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Creation of Bangladesh]] was assisted by India during which many Indian soldiers lost their lives.&lt;ref name="Amar Jyoti"&gt;{{cite news|title=Amar Jyoti|publisher=discoveredindia.com|accessdate=4 January 2017|url=http://www.discoveredindia.com/delhi/attractions/samadhis/amar-jyoti.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; In December 1971, after the ''Indo-Pakistani War of 1971'', [[Indira Gandhi]] (then [[Prime Minister of India]]) helped pay to construct the ''Amar Jawan Jyoti'' under the [[India Gate]] to commemorate the dead and unknown soldiers who died invading Pakistan. On 26 January 1972 (23rd Republic Day of India), the monument was officially inaugurated by Indira Gandhi.&lt;ref name="Amar Jyoti"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Amar Jawan Jyoti"&gt;{{cite news|title=Amar Jawan Jyoti|publisher=indiagate.org.in|accessdate=4 January 2017|url=http://www.indiagate.org.in/amar-jawan-jyoti.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since 1972, every-year on the [[Republic Day (India)|Republic Day]] (before the [[Delhi Republic Day parade|Republic Day parade]]), it has been customary for the [[President of India|President]], [[Prime Minister of India|Prime Minister]], [[Chief of the Air Staff (India)|Chief of the Air Staff]], [[Chief of the Naval Staff (India)|Chief of the Naval Staff]], [[Chief of the Army Staff (India)|Chief of the Army Staff]] and dignitaries to place [[wreath]] at ''Amar Jawan Jyoti'' and pay homage to the dead and unknown soldiers.&lt;ref name="Amar Jyoti"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Amar Jawan Jyoti"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Significance of Amar Jawan Jyoti"&gt;{{cite news|title=Significance of Amar Jawan Jyoti|publisher=indiagate.org.in|accessdate=4 January 2017|url=http://www.indiagate.org.in/articles/significance-of-amar-jawan-jyoti.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="History"&gt;{{cite news|title=History|publisher=indiagate.org.in|accessdate=4 January 2017|url=http://www.indiagate.org.in/history.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The main structure (India Gate) was originally constructed in 1921 by [[Edwin Lutyens]]. Amar Jawan Jyoti was added under the India Gate in 1971.&lt;ref name="The India Gate"&gt;{{cite news|title=The India Gate|publisher=thedivineindia.com|accessdate=4 January 2017|url=http://www.thedivineindia.com/the-india-gate/5784}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Construction and structure==
[[File:Soldier guarding Amar Jawan Jyoti.jpg|thumb|right|300px|[[Indian Army]] soldier guarding ''Amar Jawan Jyoti''.]]
Amar Jawan Jyoti is located under [[India Gate]] at [[Rajpath]] in [[New Delhi]]. It consists of a marble pedestal on which a [[cenotaph]] is situated. "Amar Jawan" (Immortal Soldier) is scripted in gold on all four sides of the cenotaph and on top, a [[L1A1 self-loading rifle]] is placed on its barrel and is capped by a helmet of the Unknown Soldier. The pedestal is bound by four urns, in one of which a flame has been burning continuously (using [[Compressed natural gas|CNG]]) since 1971.&lt;ref name="Amar Jawan Jyoti"/&gt; The person responsible for keeping the flame burning lives in a room under the [[India Gate|arch]], next to the perpetually burning flame.&lt;ref name="Keeper of the flame"&gt;{{cite news|title=Keeper of the flame|work=[[The Indian Express]]|accessdate=4 January 2017|url=http://archive.indianexpress.com/news/keeper-of-the-flame/960016/0}}&lt;/ref&gt; From 1971 to 2006, [[Liquefied petroleum gas|LPG]] was used as fuel source and from 2006, [[Compressed natural gas|CNG]] is used as source. Each of the four urns has a flame but only one of the four flames burns throughout the year; on [[Independence Day (India)|Indian Independence]] and [[Republic Day (India)|Republic Day]]s, all flames are lit simultaneously.&lt;ref name="5 things about Amar Jawan Jyoti"&gt;{{cite news|title=5 things about Amar Jawan Jyoti|publisher=thebetterindia.com|accessdate=4 January 2017|url=http://www.thebetterindia.com/43484/amar-jawan-jyoti-republic-day-delhi/}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Amar Jawan Jyoti'' is manned [[24/7 service|24/7]] by soldiers from the [[Indian Army|Army]], [[Indian Air Force|Air Force]] and the [[Indian Navy]].&lt;ref name="5 things about Amar Jawan Jyoti"/&gt;

====Greeks Gods====

Influence of beauty was derived from their Gods.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; [[Greek Gods and Goddesses of Greek mythology|Greek gods]] were believed to take a divine human form and inspired their perception of divine beauty. Temples were created in Greece to worship these gods and were filled with life-like images of them. &lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.pbs.org/howartmadetheworld/episodes/human/greece/|title=How Art Made the World .

==== Form ====
Ancient Greeks were fixated on the aesthetic form of the human body.&lt;ref name=":6"/&gt; This ideal was captured through the art of this era. &lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;Sculptures were inspired initially by the monumental art of the Ancient Egyptians.&lt;ref name=":6"/&gt; Sculptures were perceived to be at their peak of aesthetics when the human form was captured in a unique way and emphasizing a divine or godlike quality. Proportion, poise and perfection of the human form were the artistic and aesthetic ideals.&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.ancient.eu/Greek_Sculpture/|title=Ancient Greek Sculpture|work=Ancient History Encyclopedia|access-date=2018-11-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; Stone and bronze monuments are iconic of this civilization. &lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;

== Biography ==
Benn was born in 1905 in [[Białystok]], Poland, where his father was an architect and his grandfather was a [[rabbi]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; He demonstrated an early talent for painting.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; In 1917, he began giving private lessons in drawing.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; In 1926, he started making theatre sets. In 1927, Benn had his first private exhibition in [[Vilnius|Wilno, Poland]].&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.artofbenn.com/timeline-benn/|title=Art of Benn|last=|first=|date=|website=Art of Benn|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=26 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; After his admission to the Union of Professional Artists of Poland in 1928, Benn started exhibiting his works in Białystok and [[Warsaw]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Malarstwo i rzeźba Żydow Polskich w XIX i XX wieku|last=Malinowski|first=Jerzy|publisher=Wydawnictwo Naukowe PWN|year=2000|isbn=9788301131784|location=Warsaw|pages=398}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Dictionary of Artists|last=Bénézit|first=Emmanuel|publisher=Editions Gründ|year=2006|isbn=2700030702|location=Paris|pages=226 (volume 2)}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; In 1929, he received a scholarship to study for three years in Paris, where he attended the Académie [[Fernand Léger]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; It was upon his arrival in Paris that he changed his name to Benn and used it exclusively for the rest of his life. During his studies at the Académie, Benn drew on [[Geometric abstraction|geometric]] forms but refrained from becoming an abstract painter.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; In 1932, Benn met ballet dancer and artist Ghera; they wed in 1938 and Benn became a French citizen.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":8"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Carnet du camp|last=Benn|first=|last2=Riquet|first2=Michel|publisher=Impr.

In 1939, after being mobilized and discharged in [[Brittany]], Benn sent paintings from [[Rennes]] to the [[Salon d'Automne]] exhibits and began sculpting.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; In 1941, Benn was interned at [[Beaune-la-Rolande internment camp|Beaune-la-Rolande]].&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Cantate sur le chemin des hommes|last=Bancal|first=Jean|publisher=Médialogue|year=1987|isbn=9782402422710|location=Paris|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was eventually released with the help of professor Marcel Brulé and art critic Lo Duca.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; Following his release, Benn went into hiding for 26 months with the protection of [[Jean Paulhan]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; During this time, Benn produced 62 works that were inspired by biblical [[Chapters and verses of the Bible|verses]] and [[Motif (visual arts)|motifs]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Zsidóságunk tanításai|last=Benoschofsky|first=Imre|publisher=Maccabi Publications Ltd.|year=1997|isbn=9789637475276|location=Sinai|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=24 dessins pour la Bible|last=Benn|first=|publisher=Broché|year=1985|isbn=|location=Paris|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Benn|last=Treydel|first=R.|work=Allgemeines Künstlerlexikon|publisher=|year=1994|isbn=|editor-last=Meissner|editor-first=G.|volume=9|location=Munich|pages=94–95}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following the [[Liberation of Paris|Liberation]] in 1944, Benn returned permanently to Paris&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; and continued to exhibit his work in galleries and museums across Europe.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.centrepompidou.fr/cpv/resource/cxA75a6/rg8Lra|title=Le collectif Les Amis de l'Oeuvre du peintre Benn – Centre Pompidou|access-date=15 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1949, Benn collaborated with the artist [[Marc Chagall]] to create a company of painters and sculptors.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

In 1966, an association called "Friends of the Work of the Painter Benn" was established.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Following a long career, Benn bequeathed a collection of his works to the French commune [[Rueil-Malmaison]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

In 1987, Benn donated 190 biblical oils to the Musée d'art sacré du Gard.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; Benn's wife, Ghera, died in 1994. Upon her death, the {{ill|Musée d'art sacré du Gard|fr}} received an additional collection of lithographs, paintings, and medals that represented Benn's creative works and contributions.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;

== Artistic career ==
Initially inspired by [[Constructivism (art)|Russian Constructivism]], [[Kinetic art]], and [[Cubism]], Benn's style evolved over time.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Jubilé du peintre Benn: 50 ans de peinture et 70e anniversaire de Benn|last=Benn|first=Collectif|publisher=Impr. Moderne du Lion|year=1975|isbn=|location=Paris|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; He went through a geometric period that was influenced by [[Wassily Kandinsky]], then [[Symbolism (arts)|Symbolism]]; eventually he adopted a [[Poetic realism|Poetic Realist]] style.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Ben-Tsiyon Rabinovitshin|last=Learsin|first=P.|work=Illustrierte Voch|publisher=|year=1928|isbn=|volume=16|location=Warsaw|pages=14}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Benn: Fragments des compositions|last=Souriau|first=Etienne|publisher=Berger-Levrault|year=1975|isbn=|editor-link=Étienne Souriau|location=Paris|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Regards sur Benn|last=Souriau|first=Étienne|publisher=Les amis de l'oeuvre du peintre Benn|year=1979|isbn=978-3-8090-2152-0|location=Paris|pages=|author-link=Étienne Souriau}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1930, Benn was admitted to the Association of Professional Artists, Paris.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; His first exhibition in Paris was in 1931 at Galerie L'Époque.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; Between 1932 and 1939, Benn's works were exhibited at private galleries and exhibitions in France, including [[Salon d'Automne]] and [[Société des Artistes Indépendants|Les Independents]].&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; In 1940, upon the exclusion of Jewish artists from the exhibition, Benn's work was rejected by the [[Salon d'Automne]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Benn au Salon d'Automne (1932–1962)|last=Monceaux|first=R.H.|publisher=Éditions Lefort|year=1964|isbn=|location=Paris|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1956, Benn received the Gold Medal from the {{ill|Salon des Artistes Français|fr}}.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; In 1957, he was awarded the Prix de [[Institut de France|L'Institut de France]].&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; In 1960, he published ''62 psaumes et versets de la Bible'', based on sketches he did while in hiding during [[World War II]].

[[File:Girl in chibi style.svg|thumb|right|Example for a character drawn in chibi style]]
{{nihongo|'''Chibi'''|ちび or チビ|}} is a [[Japanese language|Japanese]] slang word describing something short (a thing, an animal or a person). It comes from the verb 禿びる (chibiru), which means "to wear out and become shorter" (for the tip of something).{{cn|date=March 2018}} The term is widely used in Japan to describe a specific style of [[caricature]] where characters are drawn in an exaggerated way. Typically these characters are small and chubby, with stubby limbs and oversized heads to make them resemble children. This style of artwork, also known as '''super deformed''', has since found its way into [[anime]] and [[manga]] fandom through its usage in manga works. "Chibi" can be translated as "little"(e.g. [[Chibi Maruko-chan]], which means Little Miss Maruko etc.), but is not used the same way as ''chiisana'' [小さな] / ''chiisai'' [小さい] (tiny, small, little in Japanese) but rather cute.{{cn|date=March 2018}} One example of the usage in Japanese which brought the term to the attention of Western fans is [[Chibiusa]], a [[hypocoristic|pet name]] for the [[:wiktionary:diminutive|diminutive]] daughter of [[Sailor Moon (character)|Sailor Moon]] formed from ''Chibi Usagi'' ("Little Rabbit").&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.kurozuki.com/takeuchi/sailormoon/volume03.html |title=Sailor Moon volume 3 translation |accessdate=2008-05-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Proportions==
The head of a super deformed character is normally anywhere between one third&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bakaneko.com/howto/figure/chibi/index.html "A Super Deformed Tutorial"] on Bakaneko.com&lt;/ref&gt; and one half the character's height.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.polykarbon.com/tutorials/chibi/chibiart.htm|title=Action Tutorial|website=www.polykarbon.com|accessdate=5 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to their modified proportions, super deformed characters typically lack the detail of their normal counterparts. As a result, when a character of average proportions is depicted as a super deformed character, certain aspects of his or her design will be simplified and others will be exaggerated. Details such as folds on a jacket are ignored, and general shapes are favored. If a character has a signature characteristic (odd hair, a particular accessory, etc.) this will typically be prominent on the super deformed version of the character.&lt;ref&gt;''[[How to Draw Manga]] Volume 18: Super-Deformed Characters 1: Humans''.  {{ISBN|9784766114355}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Media usage==
The "chibi" art style is part of [[Japanese culture]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://wowjapan.asia/2017/08/japanese-student-turns-philosophers-super-deformed-anime-style-characters/|title=Japanese student turns philosophers into super-deformed anime-style characters - WOWJAPAN|date=4 August 2017|publisher=|accessdate=5 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.gamasutra.com/view/news/185406/Clash_of_Clans_5_keys_to_success.php|title=Clash of Clans ' 5 keys to success|first=Mike|last=Rose|publisher=|accessdate=5 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.smosh.com/smosh-pit/articles/why-japan-hands-down-coolest-country-planet|title=Why Japan Is Hands Down The Coolest Country On The Planet - SMOSH|publisher=|accessdate=5 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; and is seen everywhere from advertising and subway signs to [[anime]] and [[manga]].  The style was popularized by franchises like ''[[Dragon Ball]]'' and ''[[SD Gundam]]'' in the 1980s.{{cn|date=March 2018}} It is also used as [[comic relief]] in anime and manga, giving additional emphasis to a character's [[Emotion|emotional]] reaction.

The super deformed art style has also appeared in anime-influenced American series&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://idea.library.drexel.edu/islandora/object/idea%3A7142/datastream/OBJ/download/Applying_2D_Japanese_Super-Deformed_character_to_traditional_American_animation.pdf|title=Applying 2D Japanese Super-Deformed character to traditional American animation|publisher=|accessdate=5 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;, such as ''[[Homestuck]]'', ''[[Teen Titans (TV Series)|Teen Titans]]'' or ''[[Avatar: The Last Airbender]]'''s Super Deformed shorts.{{cn|date=March 2018}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11419">A theater company formed in 1912, the '''Chicago Little Theatre'''  spearheaded and lent its name&lt;ref&gt;Lock, Charles. "Maurice Browne and the Chicago Little Theatre." Modern Drama 31.1, 1988. p 109.&lt;/ref&gt; to a historic, popular wave in American Theater, the [[Little Theatre Movement]]. Founded in its namesake city by [[Ellen Van Volkenburg]] and [[Maurice Browne]], the company was an ''art theater'' formed in opposition to the commercial values which held sway at the time.&lt;ref&gt;Browne, Maurice. ''Too Late to Lament: An Autobiography''. London, Gollancz, 1955; p 111 .&lt;/ref&gt; The company performed work by contemporary writers and Greek classics, as well as pioneering puppetry and puppet plays. Poetic dramas, restrained acting and new concepts in scenography were hallmarks of the Chicago Little Theatre.

== History ==

'''Founding'''

Already well ensconced by 1911 in the literary circles of Chicago, husband-and-wife artistic partners Maurice Browne and Ellen Van Volkenburg&lt;ref&gt;Browne, Maurice. ''Too Late to Lament: An Autobiography''. London, Gollancz, 1955; p. 110 ff. Browne's entré to the city's literary circles was in part due to his success as a lecturer in Chicago and partly to the connections he had developed in England and elsewhere visiting the city. Van Volkenburg was, as he notes "nearing the height of her popularity…"&lt;/ref&gt; socialized with the Irish Players of the [[Abbey Theatre]], led by [[Lady Gregory]], when they toured the Midwest in that year.&lt;ref&gt;Browne, Maurice. ''Too Late to Lament: An Autobiography''. London, Gollancz, 1955; p 115.&lt;/ref&gt; Inspired, they set out to create a theater company on that model, introducing European writers of the age whose work was not much produced in the United States, such as Ibsen, Shaw, Strindberg, Synge, Wilde, and Yeats.

After rehearsing extensively, in 1912 Van Volkenburg and Browne rented space for a theater in the [[Fine Arts Building (Chicago)]], bypassing the building's large auditorium In favor of a small space on the fourth floor that cost less than a quarter as much per year.&lt;ref&gt;Browne, Maurice. ''Too Late to Lament: An Autobiography''. London, Gollancz, 1955; p 119-20.&lt;/ref&gt; The space was built out into a 91-seat house,&lt;ref&gt;Browne, Maurice. ''Too Late to Lament: An Autobiography''. London, Gollancz, 1955; p 120.&lt;/ref&gt; its diminutive size the key to the company's name. Browne thought that "a small theatre would cost less than a large one; therefore ours was to be a ''little'' theatre." &lt;ref&gt;Browne, Maurice. ''Too Late to Lament: An Autobiography''. London, Gollancz, 1955; p 111.&lt;/ref&gt;

Browne assumed directorship of the company, while Van Volkenburg, who was already an accomplished performer,&lt;ref&gt;Browne, Maurice. ''Too Late to Lament: An Autobiography''. London, Gollancz, 1955; p 110.&lt;/ref&gt; became its leading actress. They were co-producers, with Van Volkenburg developing and directing the company's puppet productions. To the modern plays they were producing in the style of the Irish Players, the company added Greek classical dramas, which were well known to the Cambridge-educated Browne. Of the theater's repertoire, contemporary critic and founder of ''[[Theatre Arts Magazine]]'', [[Sheldon Cheney]], wrote, "The list bespeaks nothing if not breadth of view and courage. And these are qualities which the commercial producer so sadly lacks."&lt;ref&gt;Cheney, Sheldon. ''The New Movement in the Theatre''. New York, Mitchell Kennerley, 1914; p. 180.&lt;/ref&gt; Van Volkenburg pioneered "modern" puppetry in America, creating a puppet theater for the company that aspired to high artistic values, using new techniques she developed.&lt;ref&gt;Joseph, Helen Haiman. ''A Book of Marionettes''. New York, B.W. Huebsch, 1920; 173-4.&lt;/ref&gt; Browne summed up the mission of the company in this way:

&lt;blockquote&gt;It is a repertory and experimental art theatre producing classical and modern plays, both tragedy and comedy, at popular prices. Preference is given in its productions to poetic and imaginative plays, dealing primarily whether as a tragedy or comedy with character in action. … The Chicago Little Theatre has for its object the creation of a new plastic and rhythmic drama in America.&lt;ref&gt;Mackay, Constance D'Arcy. ''The Little Theatre in the United States''. New York, Henry Holt, 1917; p. 104.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Among the notable productions of the Chicago Little theater were ''The Stronger'' and ''Creditors'' by [[August Strindberg]], ''On Baile's Strand'' and ''The Shadowy Water'' by [[William Butler Yeats]] and ''Anatol'' by [[Arthur Schnitzler]].&lt;ref&gt;Cheney, Sheldon. ''The New Movement in the Theatre''. New York, Mitchell Kennerley, 1914; p. 180.&lt;/ref&gt; The company's signature piece was the classic play by [[Euripides]], ''The Trojan Women''. Browne and Van Volkenburg not only revived the play in Chicago, but toured it throughout the Western United States.&lt;ref&gt;Mackay, Constance D'Arcy. ''The Little Theatre in the United States''. New York, Henry Holt, 1917, p. 106.&lt;/ref&gt; It was on this tour that Nellie Cornish, who would provide a landing spot for the two at her Cornish School some years later, saw their work and was "deeply impressed." &lt;ref&gt;Cornish, Nellie C. ''Miss Aunt Nellie: The Autobiography of Nellie C. Cornish'', Ellen Van Volkenburg Browne and Edward Nordhoff Beck, eds. Seattle, University of Washington, 1964; p. 104.&lt;/ref&gt; Van Volkenberg played Hecuba, and Browne in later years counted it among the best performances of any actress he had seen in his life in the theater.

'''Innovations'''

The Chicago Little Theatre's stage in the Fine Arts Building, in a room never having been designed to hold a theater, had very little wing space and had large pillars to contend with.&lt;ref&gt;Browne, Maurice. ''Too Late to Lament: An Autobiography''. London, Gollancz, 1955, pp, 119-26.&lt;/ref&gt; So as a matter of practicality as well as aesthetics, the company embraced the new, non-representational forms of staging coming out of Europe utilizing "simplicity and suggestion." &lt;ref&gt;Cheney, Sheldon. The New Movement in the Theatre. New York, Mitchell Kennerley, 1914, p. 180.&lt;/ref&gt; Turning also to Asian sources for inspiration, the Little Theater was perhaps the first theater to use screens in the Japanese style as scenic elements.&lt;ref&gt;Browne, Maurice. ''Too Late to Lament: An Autobiography''. London, Gollancz, 1955, p. 172.&lt;/ref&gt;  But the theater's greatest achievement, arguably, was in lighting. Browne and his designers made revolutionary use of light to create space by pioneering in the use of dimmers to control their instruments.&lt;ref&gt;Browne, Maurice. ''Too Late to Lament: An Autobiography''. London, Gollancz, 1955, p. 123.&lt;/ref&gt;  ''The Trojan Women'', in the eyes of one contemporary writer was "a scenic triumph made possible through its remarkable lighting." &lt;ref&gt;Mackay, Constance D'Arcy. ''The Little Theatre in the United States''. New York, Henry Holt, 1917, p. 106.&lt;/ref&gt; The full, combined effect of simplicity, forced perspective and variable lighting were evident in that production:

&lt;blockquote&gt;''The Trojan Women'' had one scene throughout: a massive stone wall lost to view beyond the line of the proscenium arch, formed the background. This stone wall, jaggedly cleft in the center, showed the sky beyond. Not only were the massive square of stone that formed the wall played on by different lights as the play proceeded; but the sky beyond the jagged cleft changed gradually from the intense blue of full day to the softer colors of dusk, thus giving differentiation. The red of the flaming city also flared beyond this cleft, and characters entered or leaving the scene stood out in dark silhouette against the fiery background.&lt;ref&gt;Mackay, Constance D'Arcy. ''The Little Theatre in the United States''. New York, Henry Holt, 1917, p. 106.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

== Closing and legacy ==

Money had been hard to come by from the first days of the Chicago Little Theatre, and as the United States became involved in the First World War in 1917, interest in the company dropped off dramatically, placing the company in an impossible financial position.&lt;ref&gt;Browne, Maurice. ''Too Late to Lament: An Autobiography''. London, Gollancz, 1955, pp. 209-10.&lt;/ref&gt; After only five years of operation, the theater was forced to close is doors.

Word of the closure of The Chicago Little Theatre reached Sheldon Cheney late in 1917. It had survived only a short time, but was highly influential. Cheney rendered an assessment of the importance of the company in unequivocal terms in the pages of ''Theatre Arts Magazine'': "As this issue was going to press, we received a formal notice of the disbanding of the Chicago Little Theatre company. … With this dignified announcement there closes the most important chapter yet written in the history of the art theatre movement in this country."&lt;ref&gt;Beard, DeAnna M. Toten. ''Sheldon Cheney’s Theatre Arts Magazine: Promoting a Modern American Theatre, 1916-1921''.  Plymouth, Scarecrow Press: reprinted in "Selected Articles": "Closing of the Chicago Little Theatre," by Sheldon Cheney, ''Theatre Arts Magazine'', December 1917. p. 59.&lt;/ref&gt;

The aesthetic and practice developed by Ellen Van Volkenburg and Maurice Browne at the Chicago Little Theatre traveled with them to a number of other ventures, most notably  to the Cornish School of Music (later the [[Cornish School]]) in Seattle.&lt;ref&gt;Cornish, Nellie C. ''Miss Aunt Nellie: The Autobiography of Nellie C. Cornish'', Ellen Van Volkenburg Browne and Edward Nordhoff Beck, eds. Seattle, University of Washington, 1964; p. 107.&lt;/ref&gt; Nellie Cornish approached them about joining her faculty on a visit to Chicago, but was rebuffed. Arriving at Cornish in 1918, after the collapse of the Chicago Little Theatre, the two accepted; they co-founded the Drama Department at the school. Van Volkenburg also instituted a program in puppetry.&lt;ref&gt;Cornish, Nellie C. ''Miss Aunt Nellie: The Autobiography of Nellie C. Cornish'', Ellen Van Volkenburg Browne and Edward Nordhoff Beck, eds. Seattle, University of Washington, 1964; p. 109.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{calligraphy}}
'''Chinese calligraphy''' is a form of aesthetically pleasing writing ([[calligraphy]]), or, the artistic expression of human language in a tangible form. This type of expression has been widely practiced in [[China]] and has been generally held in high esteem across East Asia. Calligraphy is considered as one of the four traditional skills of ancient Chinese literati, along with playing stringed musical instrument, the board game “go”, and painting. There are some general standardizations of the various [[East Asian script styles|styles]] of calligraphy in this tradition. Chinese calligraphy and [[ink and wash painting]] are closely related: they are accomplished using similar tools and techniques, and have a long history of shared artistry. Distinguishing features of Chinese painting and calligraphy include an emphasis on motion charged with dynamic life. According to Stanley-Baker, "Calligraphy is sheer life experienced through energy in motion that is registered as traces on silk or paper, with time and rhythm in shifting space its main ingredients."&lt;ref name="Stanley-Barker 2010a"&gt;{{harv|Stanley-Baker|2010a|p=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Calligraphy has also led to the development of many forms of art in China, including [[Chinese seal|seal]] carving, ornate paperweights, and [[inkstone]]s.

== Characteristics ==
In China, calligraphy is referred to as ''shūfǎ'' (書法/书法), literally 'way/method/law of writing';&lt;ref&gt;書 being here used as in 楷书/楷書, etc., and meaning 'writing style'.&lt;/ref&gt; ''shodō'' ({{lang|ja|書道/书道}}) in Japan ('way/principle of writing'); and ''seoye'' (서예; 書藝) in Korea ('skill/criterion of writing'&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=王力古漢語字典|author=Wang Li|year=2000|publisher=中華書局|location=Beijing|isbn=7101012191|page=1118|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;).

Chinese calligraphy appreciated more or only for its aesthetic quality has a long tradition, and is today regarded as one of [[the arts]] (Chinese 藝術/艺术 {{zh|p=yìshù}}, a relatively recent word in Chinese)&lt;ref name=mrytmryz&gt;[http://ent.enorth.com.cn/system/2006/04/29/001293903.shtml 田蘊章《每日一題每日一字》] - Internet video series on Chinese calligraphy&lt;/ref&gt; in the countries where it is practised.  Chinese calligraphy focuses not only on methods of writing but also on cultivating one's character (人品)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.vincentpoon.com/shodo-and-calligraphy.html|title=Shodo and Calligraphy|website=Vincent's Calligraphy|access-date=2016-05-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; and taught as a pursuit (－書法; {{zh|p=shūfǎ}}, rules of writing [[Han characters]]&lt;ref&gt;Shu Xincheng 舒新城, ed.

== Calligraphy Styles    ==
{{main article|Chinese script styles}}

=== Oracle bone script ===
{{Main|Oracle bone script}}
'''[[Oracle bone script]]''' was one of the styles of Chinese calligraphy.  Written on [[Oracle bone|oracle bones]] – animal bones or turtle plastrons, it is the earliest known form of Chinese writing. The first appearance of what we recognize unequivocally to refer as “oracle bone inscriptions” comes in the form of inscribed ox scapula and turtle plastrons from sites near modern [[Anyang]] (安阳) on the northern border of [[Henan]] province. Even though there is no proof that the Shang Chinese were solely responsible for the origin of writing in China, but neither is there evidence of recognizable Chinese writing from any earlier time or any other place.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/31969720|title=The world's writing systems|date=1996|publisher=Oxford University Press|others=Daniels, Peter T., Bright, William, 1928-2006.|isbn=0195079930|location=New York|oclc=31969720}}&lt;/ref&gt; The late Shang oracle bone writings constitute the earliest significant corpus of Chinese writing and it is also the oldest known member and ancestor of the Chinese family of scripts, preceding the Chinese bronze inscriptions.  

=== Chinese Bronze Inscriptions  ===
{{Main|Chinese bronze inscriptions}}'''[[Chinese bronze inscriptions]]''' are a kind of style that usually written on the Chinese ritual bronzes. These Chinese ritual bronzes include [[Ding (vessel)|Ding]] (鼎), [[Dui (vessel)|Dui]] (敦), [[Gu (vessel)|Gu]] (觚), [[Guang (vessel)|Guang]] (觥), [[Gui (vessel)|Gui]] (簋), [[Hu (vessel)|Hu]] (壺), [[Jia (vessel)|Jia]] (斝), [[Jue (vessel)|Jue]] (爵), [[Yi (vessel)|Yi]] (匜), [[You (vessel)|You]] (卣), [[Zun]] (尊), and [[Yi (vessel)|Yi]] (彝). Different time period has different method of inscription. Shang bronze inscriptions were nearly all cast along with the implements on which they appear.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/43936866|title=Chinese writing|last=Xigui,|first=Qiu,|last2=裘錫圭.|publisher=|others=Mattos, Gilbert Louis, 1939-, Norman, Jerry, 1936-2012,, Qiu, Xigui,, 裘錫圭,|year=|isbn=1557290717|location=Berkeley, California|pages=113|oclc=43936866}}&lt;/ref&gt; In later dynasty such as Western [[Zhou dynasty|Zhou]], Spring and Autumn Period, the inscriptions were often engraved after the bronze was cast.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/43936866|title=Chinese writing|last=Xigui,|first=Qiu,|last2=裘錫圭.|publisher=|others=Mattos, Gilbert Louis, 1939-, Norman, Jerry, 1936-2012,, Qiu, Xigui,, 裘錫圭,|year=|isbn=1557290717|location=Berkeley, California|pages=73|oclc=43936866}}&lt;/ref&gt; The bronze inscriptions are one of the earliest scripts in the [[Chinese family of scripts]], preceded by the [[oracle bone script]].    

=== Seal script ===
{{Main|Seal script}}'''[[Seal script]]''' ([[Traditional Chinese characters|Chinese]]: 篆書; [[pinyin]]: ''zhuànshū'') is an ancient [[Chinese script styles|style]] of writing [[Chinese characters]] that was common throughout the latter half of the 1st millennium BC. It evolved organically out of the [[Zhou dynasty]] [[Bronze script|script]]. The [[Qin (state)|Qin]] variant of seal script eventually became the standard, and was adopted as the formal script for all of China during the [[Qin dynasty]]. 
=== Clerical script ===
{{Main|Clerical script}}The '''[[clerical script]]''' ([[Traditional Chinese characters|traditional Chinese]]: 隸書; [[Simplified Chinese characters|simplified Chinese]]: 隶书; [[pinyin]]: ''lìshū'') is an archaic style of Chinese calligraphy. The clerical script began during Han dynasty and has lasted up to the present. The clerical script is considered as a form of modern script even though it was replaced by the standard script by very early date. It was all because the graphic forms written in mature clerical script closely resemble those written in standard script.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/43936866|title=Chinese writing|last=Xigui,|first=Qiu,|last2=裘錫圭.|publisher=|others=Mattos, Gilbert Louis, 1939-, Norman, Jerry, 1936-2012,, Qiu, Xigui,, 裘錫圭,|year=|isbn=1557290717|location=Berkeley, California|pages=113|oclc=43936866}}&lt;/ref&gt; The clerical script is still used for artistic flavor in a variety of functional applications because of its high legibility of reading. 

=== Regular script ===
{{Main|Regular script}}'''[[Regular script]]''' ([[Traditional Chinese characters|traditional Chinese]]: 楷書; [[Simplified Chinese characters|simplified Chinese]]: 楷书; [[pinyin]]: ''kǎishū'') is the newest of the Chinese script styles. The [[regular script]] first come into existence between the [[Han dynasty|Han]] and [[Cao Wei|Wei]] dynasties, even though it is not popular. The [[regular script]] becomes mature stylistically around the 7th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/43936866|title=Chinese writing|last=Xigui,|first=Qiu,|last2=裘錫圭.|publisher=|others=Mattos, Gilbert Louis, 1939-, Norman, Jerry, 1936-2012,, Qiu, Xigui,, 裘錫圭,|year=|isbn=1557290717|location=Berkeley, California|pages=143|oclc=43936866}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first master of regular script is [[Zhong You]]. [[Zhong You]] first used regular script to write some very serious pieces such as memorials to the emperor.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/43936866|title=Chinese writing|last=Xigui,|first=Qiu,|last2=裘錫圭.|publisher=|others=Mattos, Gilbert Louis, 1939-, Norman, Jerry, 1936-2012,, Qiu, Xigui,, 裘錫圭,|year=|isbn=1557290717|location=Berkeley, California|pages=143|oclc=43936866}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

=== Semi-cursive ===
{{Main|Semi-cursive script}}'''[[Semi-cursive script]]''' also known as ([[Simplified Chinese characters|simplified Chinese]]: 行书; [[Traditional Chinese characters|traditional Chinese]]: 行書; [[pinyin]]: [[Semi-cursive script|Xíng]]), is a cursive [[Chinese script styles|style]] of [[Chinese character|Chinese characters]]. Because it is not as abbreviated as [[Cursive script (East Asia)|cursive]], most people who can read [[regular script]] can read semi-cursive. It is highly useful and also artistic.

=== Cursive script (East Asia) ===
{{Main|Cursive script (East Asia)}}'''[[Cursive script (East Asia)|Cursive script]]''', also known as ([[Simplified Chinese characters|simplified Chinese]]: 草书; [[Traditional Chinese characters|traditional Chinese]]: 草書; [[pinyin]]: ''cǎoshū''), originated in China during the Han dynasty through the [[Jin dynasty (265–420)|Jin]] period (link needed). The cursive script is faster to write than other styles, but difficult to read for those unfamiliar with it. The “grass” in Chinese was also used in the sense of “coarse, rough; simple and crude.”&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/43936866|title=Chinese writing|last=Xigui,|first=Qiu,|last2=裘錫圭.|publisher=|others=Mattos, Gilbert Louis, 1939-, Norman, Jerry, 1936-2012,, Qiu, Xigui,, 裘錫圭,|year=|isbn=1557290717|location=Berkeley, California|pages=130|oclc=43936866}}&lt;/ref&gt; It would appear that ''cǎo'' in the term caoshu “grass script” was used in this same sense. The term ''cǎoshū'' has broad and narrow meanings. In broad sense, it is non-temporal and can refer to any characters which have been hastily written. In narrow sense, it refer to the specific handwriting style in Han dynasty.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/43936866|title=Chinese writing|last=Xigui,|first=Qiu,|last2=裘錫圭.|publisher=|others=Mattos, Gilbert Louis, 1939-, Norman, Jerry, 1936-2012,, Qiu, Xigui,, 裘錫圭,|year=|isbn=1557290717|location=Berkeley, California|pages=131|oclc=43936866}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

== History ==
{{Main|Chinese script styles}}
[[File:Mi Fu-On Calligraphy.jpg|thumb|''On Calligraphy'' by [[Mi Fu]], [[Song Dynasty]]]]

===Ancient China===
Chinese characters can be retraced to 4000 BC signs ({{harvnb|Lu|Aiken|2004|p= }}).

In 2003, at the site of Xiaoshuangqiao (小双桥), about 20&amp;nbsp;km southeast of the ancient [[Zhengzhou Shang City]], ceramic inscriptions dating to 1435–1412 BC have been found by archaeologists. These writings are made in [[cinnabar]] paint. Thus, the dates of writing in China have been confirmed for the Middle Shang period.&lt;ref name="kaogu.cn"&gt;Song Guoding (2004), [http://www.kaogu.cn/en/Chinese%20Archaeology/4/The%20Cinnabar%20Inscriptions%20Discovered%20at%20the%20Xiaoshuangqiao%20Site,%20Zhengzhou.pdf ''The Cinnabar Inscriptions Discovered at the Xiaoshuangqiao Site, Zhengzhou.''] Chinese Archaeology. Volume 4, Issue 1, Pages 98–102&lt;/ref&gt;

The ceramic ritual vessel vats that bear these cinnabar inscriptions were all unearthed within the palace area of this site. They were unearthed mostly in the sacrificial pits holding cow skulls and cow horns, but also in other architectural areas. The inscriptions are written on the exterior and interior of the rim, and the exterior of the belly of the large type of vats. The characters are mostly written singly; character compounds or sentences are rarely seen.&lt;ref name="kaogu.cn"/&gt;

The contemporary Chinese character's set principles were clearly visible in [[History of China#Ancient China|ancient China]]'s [[Oracle bone script|Jiǎgǔwén characters]](甲骨文) carved on [[ox]] [[scapula]]s and [[tortoise]] [[plastron]]s around 14th - 11th century BCE ({{harvnb|Lu|Aiken|2004|p= }}). Brush-written examples decay over time and have not survived. During the divination ceremony, after the cracks were made, characters were written with a brush on the shell or bone to be later carved (Keightley, 1978). Each archaic kingdom of current China continued to revise its set of characters.

===Imperial China===
[[File:Poems of The four treasures in a schoolar’s study (Qing).jpg|thumb|right|Poems of The four treasures in a scholar's study ([[Qing dynasty]])]]
For more than 2,000 years, China's literati—Confucian scholars and literary men who also served the government as officials—have been connoisseurs and practitioners of this art.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite book|title=ART HISTORY Volume I|last=STOKSTAD|first=MARILYN|last2=W.

In about 220 BC, the emperor [[Qin Shi Huang]] （秦始皇, 259 BCE - 210 BCE）, the first to conquer the entire Chinese basin, imposed several reforms, among them [[Li Si]]'s (李斯, 246-208 BCE) character unification, which created a set of 3300 standardized ''Xiǎozhuàn'' characters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last= Fazzioli |first= Edoardo |others= calligraphy by Rebecca Hon Ko |title= Chinese calligraphy : from pictograph to ideogram : the history of 214 essential Chinese/Japanese characters |origyear= 1987 |publisher= [[Abbeville Publishing Group (Abbeville Press, Inc.)|Abbeville Press]] |location= New York |isbn=978-0-89659-774-7 |page= 13 |quote= And so the first Chinese dictionary was born, the ''S&amp;#x101;n Ch&amp;#x101;ng'', containing {{formatnum:3300}} characters|year= 1987 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite the fact that the main writing implement of the time was already the brush, little paper survives from this period, and the main examples of this style are on steles.

The [[Clerical script|Lìshū style]] (clerical script) which is more regularized, and in some ways similar to modern text, were also authorised under Qin Shi Huang.&lt;ref name="Blakney, p6"&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=7-ZYX4xCXygC&amp;lpg=PA3&amp;ots=YxoWBtBfN-&amp;dq=%22Li%20Ssu%22%20reform%20small%20seal&amp;lr=&amp;pg=PA6#v=onepage&amp;q=Li%20Ssu&amp;f=false Blakney, p6] :

Blakney|title=A Course in the Analysis of Chinese Characters|pages=148|publisher=Lulu.com|year=2007|isbn=978-1-897367-11-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; While it is a common mistake to believe that Lishu was created by Cheng Miao alone during Qing Shi Huang’ regime, Lishu was developed from pre-Qin era to the Han dynasty (202BCE-220CE).

During the fourth century CE, calligraphy came to full maturity.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; The [[Regular script|Kǎishū style]] (traditional regular script) — still in use today — and attributed to [[Wang Xizhi]] (王羲之, 303-361) and his followers, is even more regularized.&lt;ref name="Blakney, p6" /&gt; reached its peak in the Tang Dynasty, when famous calligraphers like Yan Zhenqing and Liu Gongquan produced most of the fine works in Kaishu. Its spread was encouraged by [[Li Siyuan|Emperor Mingzong of Later Tang]] (926-933), who ordered the printing of the classics using new wooden blocks in Kaishu. Printing technologies here allowed shapes to stabilize. The Kaishu shape of characters 1000 years ago was mostly similar to that at the end of Imperial China.&lt;ref name="Blakney, p6" /&gt; But small changes have been made, for example in the shape of &lt;big&gt;广&lt;/big&gt; which is not absolutely the same in the [[Kangxi Dictionary]] of 1716 as in modern books. The Kangxi and current shapes have tiny differences, while stroke order is still the same, according to old style.&lt;ref&gt;康熙字典 Kangxi Zidian, 1716. Scanned version available at www.kangxizidian.com. See for example the radicals &lt;big&gt;卩&lt;/big&gt;, &lt;big&gt;厂&lt;/big&gt; or &lt;big&gt;广&lt;/big&gt;, p.41. The 2007 common shape for those characters does not clearly show the stroke order, but old versions, visible on the Kangxi Zidian p.41 clearly allow the stroke order to be determined.&lt;/ref&gt;

Cursive styles such as ''[[Semi-cursive script|Xíngshū]]'' (semi-cursive or running script) and ''[[Cursive script (East Asia)|Cǎoshū]]'' (cursive or sloppy script) are less constrained and faster, where more movements made by the writing implement are visible. These styles' stroke orders vary more, sometimes creating radically different forms. They are descended from Clerical script, at the same time as Regular script ([[Han Dynasty]] 202BCE-220CE), but Xíngshū and Cǎoshū were used for personal notes only and were never used as a standard. Caoshu style was highly appreciated during the reign of [[Emperor Wu of Han]] (140 BCE−87BCE).&lt;ref name="Blakney, p6" /&gt;

Styles which did not survive include Bāfēnshū, a mix of 80% Xiaozhuan style and 20% Lishu.&lt;ref name="Blakney, p6" /&gt;
Some [[Variant Chinese character]]s were unorthodox or locally used for centuries. They were generally understood but always rejected in official texts. Some of these unorthodox variants, in addition to some newly created characters, were incorporated in the [[Simplified Chinese]] character set.

=== Hard-pen calligraphy ===
This way of writing started to develop in the 1900s when fountain pens were imported into China from the west. Writing with fountain pens remained a convenience until the 1980s. With the Reform and Open, public focused on practicing hard-pen calligraphy. People usually Chinese simplified characters in semi-cursive or regular style.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

===Printed and computer styles===
Examples of modern printed styles are [[Ming (typeface)|Song]] from the [[Song Dynasty]]'s [[Four Great Inventions of ancient China#Printing|printing press]], and [[East Asian sans-serif typeface|sans-serif]]. These are not considered traditional styles, and are normally not written.

== Materials and tools ==
The ink brush, ink, paper, and inkstone are essential implements of Chinese calligraphy. They are known together as the ''[[Four Treasures of the Study]]''.  In addition to these four tools, a [[Water-dropper (calligraphy)|water-dropper]], desk pads and paperweights are also used by calligraphers.

=== Brush ===
{{Main|Ink brush}}
A brush is the traditional writing instrument for Chinese calligraphy. The body of the brush is commonly made from [[bamboo]] or other materials such as wood, porcelain, or horn. The head of the brush is typically made from animal hair, such as [[Siberian weasel|weasel]], [[rabbit]], [[deer]], [[goat]], [[pig]], [[tiger]], [[wolf]], etc. There is also a tradition in both China and Japan of making a brush using the hair of a newborn child, as a once-in-a-lifetime souvenir. This practice is associated with the legend of an ancient Chinese scholar who scored first in the [[imperial examination]]s by using such a personalized brush.{{Citation needed|date=June 2017}} Calligraphy brushes are widely considered an extension of the calligrapher's arm.

Today, calligraphy may also be done using a [[pen]].

=== Paper ===
[[Image:Chinese calligraphy scheme 03-en.svg|thumb|250px|right|Calligraphy tools]]

Paper is frequently sold together with a paperweight and [[desk pad]].

Some people insist that Chinese calligraphy should use special papers, such as Xuan paper, Maobian paper, Lianshi paper etc. Any modern papers can be used for brush writing. Because of the long-term uses, Xuan paper became well known by most of Chinese calligraphers.

In [[China]], ''[[Xuanzhi]]'' (宣紙), traditionally made in [[Anhui]] province, is the preferred type of paper. It is made from the [[Tatar wingceltis]] (''Pteroceltis tatarianovii''), as well as other materials including [[rice]], the [[paper mulberry]] (''Broussonetia papyrifera''), [[bamboo]], [[hemp]], etc.
In [[Japan]], ''[[washi]]'' is made from the ''kozo'' (paper mulberry), ''[[ganpi]]'' (''Wikstroemia sikokiana''), and ''[[Edgeworthia papyrifera|mitsumata]]'' (''Edgeworthia papyrifera''), as well as other materials such as bamboo, rice, and [[wheat]].

==== Paperweights ====
[[Paperweight]]s are used to hold down paper. A paperweight is often placed at the top of all but the largest pages to prevent slipping; for smaller pieces the left hand is also placed at the bottom of the page for support. Paperweights come in several types: some are oblong wooden blocks carved with calligraphic or pictorial designs; others are essentially small sculptures of people or animals. Like ink stones, paperweights are collectible works of art on their own right.

==== Desk pads ====
The [[desk pad]] (Chinese [[Traditional Chinese|T]]: 畫氈, [[Simplified Chinese|S]]: 画毡, [[Pinyin]]: huàzhān; Japanese: 下敷 [[shitajiki]]) is a pad made of [[felt]]. Some are printed with grids on both sides, so that when it is placed under the translucent paper, it can be used as a guide to ensure correct placement and size of characters. However, these printed pads are used only by students. Both desk pads and the printed grids come in a variety of sizes.

=== Ink and inkstick ===
[[Image:Chinese calligraphy scheme 01-en.svg|thumb|250px|right|Using an ink stick and inkstone]]
[[Image:Chinese - Brushwasher in the Form of a Leaf - Walters 491212 - Side B.jpg|left|150px|thumb|Brush-washers for removing excess ink are essential tools in the traditional art of Chinese calligraphy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |publisher= [[The Walters Art Museum]]
 |url= http://art.thewalters.org/detail/9204
 |title=Chinese - Brushwasher in the Form of a Leaf }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Walters Art Museum.]]
Ink is made from lampblack (soot) and binders, and comes in [[inkstick]]s which must be rubbed with water on an inkstone until the right consistency is achieved. Much cheaper, pre-mixed bottled inks are now available, but these are used primarily for practice as stick inks are considered higher quality and chemical inks are more prone to bleeding over time, making them less suitable for use in hanging scrolls. Learning to rub the ink is an essential part of calligraphy study. Traditionally, Chinese calligraphy is written only in black ink, but modern calligraphers sometimes use other colors. Calligraphy teachers use a bright orange or red ink with which they write practice characters on which students trace, or to correct students' work.

=== Inkstone ===
Commonly made from stone, ceramic, or clay, an [[inkstone]] is used to grind the solid inkstick into liquid ink and to contain the ink once it is liquid. [[Chinese inkstone]]s are highly prized as art objects and an extensive bibliography is dedicated to their history and appreciation, especially in China.

=== Seal and seal paste ===
[[Image:Chinese calligraphy scheme 02-en.svg|thumb|250px|right|Using seal paste with a Chinese seal]]
{{Main|Chinese seal}}
Calligraphic works are usually completed by the calligrapher applying one or more [[Chinese seal|seals]] in red ink. The seal can serve the function of a signature.

== Technique ==
The shape, size, stretch, and type of hair in the brush, the color and density of the ink, as well as the absorptive speed and surface texture of the paper are the main physical parameters influencing the final result. The calligrapher also influences the result by the quantity of ink/water he lets the brush take up, then by the pressure, inclination, and direction he gives to the brush, producing thinner or bolder strokes, and smooth or toothed borders. Eventually, the speed, acceleration and deceleration of the writer's moves and turns, and the [[stroke order]] give  "spirit" to the characters by influencing greatly their final shape. The “spirit” is referred to yi in Chinese calligraphy. Yi means “intention or idea” in Chinese. The more practice a calligrapher has, his or her technique will transfer from youyi (intentionally making a piece of work) to wuyi (creating art with unintentional moves). Wuyi is considered as a higher stage for calligraphers, which require the calligrapher to have perfect control over the brush and wrist and following his or her heart.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Shi|first=Xiongbo|date=2018|title=The Aesthetic Concept of Yi 意 in Chinese Calligraphic Creation|url=|journal=Philosophy East and West|volume=68|pages=871-886|via=Project Muse}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Study==

Traditionally, the bulk of the study of calligraphy is composed of copying strictly exemplary works from the apprentice's master or from reputed calligraphers, thus learning them by rote. The master showing the 'right way' to draw items, which the apprentice have to copy strictly, continuously, until the move becomes instinctive and the copy perfect. Deviation from the model is seen as a failure.&lt;ref name="Stanley-Barker 2010a" /&gt; Competency in a particular style often requires many years of practice. Correct strokes, [[stroke order]], character structure, balance, and rhythm are essential in calligraphy. A student would also develop their skills in traditional [[Chinese arts]], as familiarity and ability in the arts contributes to their calligraphy.

Since the development of [[regular script]], nearly all calligraphers have started their study by imitating exemplary models of regular script. A beginning student may practice writing the character 永 ({{zh|yǒng}}, ''eternal'') for its abundance of different kinds of strokes and difficulty in construction. The [[Eight Principles of Yong]] refers to the eight different strokes in the character, which some argue summarizes the different strokes in regular script.

How the brush is held depends on the calligrapher and which calligraphic genre is practiced. Commonly, the brush is held vertically straight gripped between the thumb and middle finger. The index finger lightly touches the upper part of the shaft of the brush (stabilizing it) while the ring and little fingers tuck under the bottom of the shaft, leaving a space inside the palm. Alternatively, the brush is held in the right hand between the thumb and the index finger, very much like a Western pen. A calligrapher may change his or her grip depending on the style and script. For example, a calligrapher may grip higher for [[Cursive script (East Asia)|cursive]] and lower for [[regular script]].

In Japan, smaller pieces of [[Japanese calligraphy]] are traditionally written while in [[seiza]]. In modern times, however, writers frequently practice calligraphy seated on a chair at a table. Larger pieces may be written while standing; in this case the paper is usually placed directly on the floor, but some calligraphers use an easel.

Basic calligraphy instruction is part of the regular school curriculum in both China and Japan and specialized programs of study exist at the higher education level in China, Japan, Korea, and Taiwan.  In contemporary times, debate emerged on the limits of this copyist tradition within the modern art scenes, where innovation is the rule, while changing lifestyles, tools, and colors are also influencing new waves of masters.&lt;ref name="Stanley-Barker 2010a" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Stanley-Barker 2010b"&gt;{{harv|Stanley-Baker|2010b|pp=9–10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Chinese calligraphy is being promoted in Chinese schools to counter [[Character amnesia]] brought on by technology usage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=New calligraphy classes for China's internet generation|newspaper=BBC NEWS ASIA-PACIFIC|date=27 August 2011|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-pacific-14693677|accessdate=August 29, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In recent study, Chinese calligraphy writing have been used as cognitive intervention strategy among older adults or people with mild cognitive impairment. For example, in a recent randomized control trial experiment, calligraphy writing enhanced both working memory and attention control compared to controlled groups &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Chan | first1 = SCC | year = 2017 | title = Chinese Calligraphy Writing for Augmenting Attentional Control and Working Memory of Older Adults at Risk of Mild Cognitive Impairment: A Randomized Controlled Trial | journal = Journal of Alzheimer's Disease | volume = 58 | issue = 3| pages = 735–746 | doi = 10.3233/JAD-170024 | pmid=28482639}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Evaluation and appreciation==
While appreciating calligraphy will depend on individual preferences, there are established traditional rules and those who repeatedly violate them are not considered legitimate calligraphers.&lt;ref name=mrytmryz /&gt; Among these rules are:
*'''The characters must be written correctly.'''&lt;ref name=mrytmryz /&gt; A correctly written character is composed in a way that is accepted as correct by legitimate calligraphers. Calligraphic works often use [[variant Chinese character]]s, which are deemed correct or incorrect case-by-case, but in general, more popular variants are more likely to be correct. Correct characters are written in the traditional stroke order and not a modern standard.
*'''The characters must be legible.'''&lt;ref name=mrytmryz /&gt; As calligraphy is the method of writing well, a calligraphic work must be recognizable as script, and furthermore be easily legible to those familiar with the script style, although it may be illegible to those unfamiliar with the script style. For example, many people cannot read [[Cursive script (East Asia)|cursive]], but a calligraphic work in cursive can still be considered good if those familiar with cursive can read it.
*'''The characters must be concise.'''&lt;ref name=mrytmryz /&gt; This is in contrast to [[Western calligraphy]] where flourishes are acceptable and often desirable. Good Chinese calligraphy must be unadorned script. It must also be in black ink unless there is a reason to write in other ink.
*'''The characters must fit their context.'''&lt;ref name=mrytmryz /&gt; All reputable calligraphers in China were well educated and well read. In addition to calligraphy, they were skilled in other areas, most likely [[Chinese painting|painting]], [[Chinese poetry|poetry]], [[Music of China|music]], [[Chinese opera|opera]], [[Chinese martial arts|martial arts]], and [[Go (game)|Go]]. Therefore, their abundant education contributed to their calligraphy. A calligrapher practicing another calligrapher's characters would always know what the text means, when it was created, and in what circumstances. When they write, their characters' shape and weight agrees with the rhythm of the phrases, especially in less constrained styles such as [[Semi-cursive script|semi-cursive]] and [[Cursive script (East Asia)|cursive]]. One who does not know the meaning of the characters they write, but varies their shape and weight on a whim, does not produce good calligraphy.
*'''The characters must be aesthetically pleasing.'''&lt;ref name=mrytmryz /&gt; Generally, characters that are written correctly, legibly, concisely, and in the correct context are also aesthetically pleasing to some degree. Characters that violate the above rules are often less aesthetically pleasing. An experienced calligrapher will consider the quality of the line, the structure of each character which the lines are placed, the compositional organization of groups of characters. Throughout the work, the brush line of light or dark, dry or wet should record the process of the artist creating the work vividly.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Barnhart|first=Richard|date=1972|title=Chinese Calligraphy: The Inner World of the Brush|url=https://www.jstor.org/stable/3258680|journal=The Metropolitan Museum of Art Bulletin|volume=|pages=230-241|via=JSTOR}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Influences ==
=== Calligraphy in Japan and Korea ===
The Japanese and Koreans have developed their own specific sensibilities and styles of calligraphy while incorporating Chinese influences, as well as applying to specific scripts. [[Japanese calligraphy]] extends beyond [[Hanzi|Han characters]] to also include local scripts such as [[hiragana]] and [[katakana]].

In the case of [[Korean calligraphy]], the [[Hangeul]] and the existence of the circle required the creation of a new technique.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.daikynguyen.com/eet/print_archive/united_states/chicago/2006/05-May/26/B7.pdf Daikynguyen.com] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110708220741/http://www.daikynguyen.com/eet/print_archive/united_states/chicago/2006/05-May/26/B7.pdf |date=2011-07-08 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Other arts ===
[[File:Chinesecalligraphywater1.jpg|thumb|Water calligraphy or ground calligraphy is a popular pastime in China.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{cite book|last=Li|first=Wendan|title=Chinese writing and calligraphy|year=2009|publisher=University of Hawaiʻi Press|location=Honolulu|isbn=978-0-8248-3364-0|pages=14–15}}&lt;/ref&gt;]] 
The existence of temporary calligraphy is also to be noted. This is the practice of water-only calligraphy on the floor which dries out within minutes. This practice is especially appreciated by the new generation of retired Chinese in public parks of China.

Calligraphy has influenced [[ink and wash painting]], which is accomplished using similar tools and techniques. Calligraphy has influenced most major art styles in [[East Asia]], including [[Ink and wash painting]], a style of [[Chinese painting|Chinese]], [[Japanese painting|Japanese]], and [[Korean painting]] based entirely on calligraphy.

The '''coat of arms of the Municipality of [[Alba Iulia]]''' unites the traditional [[heraldry|heraldic]] symbols of the three Romanian Principalities: [[Wallachia]]'s golden eagle, [[Moldavia]]'s black [[aurochs]], and [[Transylvania]]'s two lions rampant (i.e. standing on their hind legs). In chief is a Romanian crown on a [[ermine (heraldry)|ermine]] field.

The '''coat of arms of Alberta''', the [[heraldic symbol]] representing the Canadian province of [[Alberta]], contains symbols reflecting Alberta's British heritage along with local symbols. The upper part of the shield features the [[Saint George's Cross | red cross of Saint George]]. The lower portion of the shield depicts the [[Rocky Mountains]], grass prairies, and wheat fields - representing Alberta's landscape.

A [[royal warrant (document)| royal warrant]] of King [[Edward VII]] granted the original arms, consisting of only the shield, on May 30, 1907.&lt;ref name="CanHeritage"&gt;

}}
&lt;/ref&gt;
The arms were further augmented with supporters, a crest, and motto, by royal warrant of Queen [[Elizabeth II]] on July 30, 1980.

The shield, on a plain blue field, features in Alberta's [[Flag of Alberta|provincial flag]].

==History==
On 30 July 1980, [[Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom|Queen Elizabeth II]] augmented the [[armorial bearings]] by Royal Warrant with a crest, supporters, and a motto.&lt;ref name="CanHeritage" /&gt; The helmet under the crest was changed from a steel helmet to a gold royal helmet on 15 January 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://corporateidentity.alberta.ca/downloads/GoaCIM-1.0-Brand.pdf |title=The Government of Alberta Corporate Identity Manual |author=Government of Alberta |date=6 June 2010 |page=43 |accessdate=4 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://archive.gg.ca/heraldry/pub-reg/project-pic.asp?lang=e&amp;ProjectID=1206&amp;ProjectElementID=4187 |title=The Public Register of Arms, Flags and Badges of Canada – Heraldry |author= |date= |work= |publisher= |accessdate=4 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Symbolism==

; [[Crest (heraldry)|Crest]]
: The crest sits above the shield and consists of a royal helmet crowned with a red and silver wreath, on top of which sits a [[American Beaver|beaver]], resting on top of which is [[St Edward's Crown]].  White and red are the official [[national colours of Canada]], and the beaver is the official animal of Canada.
; [[Escutcheon (heraldry)|Shield]]
: The shield represents the natural resources and beauty of the varied Alberta landscape: the [[Rocky Mountains]] and their foothills, the grass [[prairie]]s, and the cultivated wheat fields. [[St George's Cross]] is an allusion to the arms of the [[Hudson's Bay Company]], which once controlled what is now Alberta.
; [[Compartment (heraldry)|Compartment]]
: The compartment or base is a grassy mount with (wild roses), the official flower of Alberta.
; [[Supporters]]
: The supporters sit on either side of the shield and consist of a golden [[lion (heraldry)|lion]] on the left (representing power) and a [[pronghorn]] on the right (representing Alberta's natural resources).  Neither of these is the official animal of Alberta (which is the [[bighorn sheep]]).
; [[Motto]]
:{{lang|la|Fortis et Liber}}, meaning "strong and free", a phrase from the English lyrics of "[[O Canada]]".

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="27414">{{Mythology}}
'''Comparative mythology''' is the comparison of [[myth]]s from different cultures in an attempt to identify shared themes and characteristics.&lt;ref name="Littleton 32"&gt;Littleton, p. 32&lt;/ref&gt; Comparative mythology has served a variety of academic purposes. For example, scholars have used the relationships between different myths to trace the development of [[religion]]s and [[culture]]s, to propose common origins for myths from different cultures, and to support various [[psychology|psychological theories]].

==Comparativists versus particularists==
The [[anthropologist]] [[C. Scott Littleton]] defined comparative mythology as "the systematic comparison of myths and mythic themes drawn from a wide variety of cultures".&lt;ref name="Littleton 32" /&gt; By comparing different cultures' mythologies, scholars try to identify underlying similarities and/or to reconstruct a "protomythology" from which those mythologies developed.&lt;ref name="Littleton 32" /&gt; To an extent, all theories about mythology follow a comparative approach: as the scholar of religion Robert Segal notes, "by definition, all theorists [of myth] seek similarities among myths".&lt;ref&gt;Segal, "The Romantic Appeal of Joseph Campbell"&lt;/ref&gt; However, scholars of mythology can be roughly divided into particularists, who emphasize the differences between myths, and comparativists, who emphasize the similarities. Particularists tend to "maintain that the similarities deciphered by comparativists are vague and superficial", while comparativists tend to "contend that the differences etched by particularists are trivial and incidental".&lt;ref&gt;Segal, ''Theorizing About Myth'', p. 148&lt;/ref&gt;

Comparative approaches to mythology held great popularity among eighteenth- and nineteenth-century scholars. Many of these scholars believed that all myths showed signs of having evolved from athought which interpreted nearly all myths as poetic descriptions of the sun's behavior. According to this theory, these poetic descriptions had become distorted over time into seemingly diverse stories about gods and heroes.&lt;ref name="Leonard"&gt;Leonard&lt;/ref&gt; However, modern-day scholars lean more toward particularism, feeling suspicious of broad statements about myths.&lt;ref name="Northup 8"&gt;Northup, p. 8&lt;/ref&gt; A recent exception is the historical approach followed in E.J. [[Michael Witzel]]'s reconstruction of many subsequent layers of older mythologies &lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;E.J.M. Witzel, "The Origins of the World's Mythologies, New York : OUP 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

==Approaches==
Comparative mythologists come from various fields, including [[folklorist|folklore]], [[anthropology]], [[history]], [[linguistics]], and [[religious studies]], and they have used a variety of methods to compare myths. These are some important approaches to comparative mythology.

===Linguistic===
{{See also|Proto-Indo-European religion|Proto-Indo-Iranian religion}}
Some scholars look at the linguistic relationships between the myths of different cultures. For example, the similarities between the names of gods in different cultures. One particularly successful example of this approach is the study of [[Proto-Indo-European religion|Indo-European]] mythology. Scholars have found striking similarities between the mythological and religious terms used in different cultures of Europe and India. For example, the [[Greek mythology|Greek]] sky-god [[Zeus Pater]], the Roman sky-god [[Jupiter (mythology)|Jupiter]], and the Indian (Vedic) sky-god [[Dyaus Pita|Dyauṣ Pitṛ]] have linguistically identical names.

This suggests that the Greeks, Romans, and Indians originated from a common ancestral culture, and that the names [[Zeus]], [[Jupiter (mythology)|Jupiter]], [[Dyaus]] and the Germanic [[Týr|Tiu]] (cf. English Tues-day) evolved from an older name, [[Dyēus|*Dyēus ph&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;ter]], which referred to the sky-god or, to give a perfect English cognate, the ''day-father'' in a [[Proto-Indo-European religion]].&lt;ref&gt;Watkins 47–48&lt;/ref&gt;

===Structural===
{{See also|Lévi-Strauss#The structuralist approach to myth|Structuralist theory of mythology|Structural anthropology|Vladimir Propp}}
Some scholars look for underlying structures shared by different myths. The folklorist [[Vladimir Propp]] proposed that many [[Russian language|Russian]] [[fairy tales]] have a common plot structure, in which certain events happen in a predictable order.&lt;ref&gt;Propp, ''passim''&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast, the anthropologist [[Claude Lévi-Strauss]] examined the structure of a myth in terms of the abstract relationships between its elements, rather than their order in the plot. In particular, Lévi-Strauss believed that the elements of a myth could be organized into binary oppositions (raw vs. cooked, nature vs. culture, etc.). He thought that the myth's purpose was to "mediate" these oppositions, thereby resolving basic tensions or contradictions found in human life or culture.&lt;ref&gt;Lévi-Strauss, p. 224&lt;/ref&gt;

===Psychological===
{{See also|Oedipus complex|Analytical psychology|Jungian archetypes}}
Some scholars propose that myths from different cultures reveal the same, or similar, psychological forces at work in those cultures. Some [[Freudian]] thinkers have identified stories similar to the Greek story of [[Oedipus]] in many different cultures. They argue that these stories reflect the different expressions of the [[Oedipus complex]] in those cultures.&lt;ref&gt;Johnson and Price-Williams, ''passim''&lt;/ref&gt; Likewise, [[Jungian]]s have identified images, themes, and patterns that appear in the myths of many different cultures. They believe that these similarities result from [[Jungian archetypes|archetypes]] present in the [[unconscious mind|unconscious levels]] of every person's mind.&lt;ref&gt;Graves, p. 251&lt;/ref&gt;

===Historical and comparative===
A new approach, which is both historical and comparative, has recently been proposed by E.J. [[Michael Witzel]].&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; He compares collections of mythologies of various cultures, from Iceland and Egypt to the Mayas, and reconstructs increasingly older levels, parallel to but not necessarily dependent on language families (see above). The most prominent common feature is a story line that extends from the creation of the world and of humans to their end. This feature is found in the northern mythologies of Eurasia and the Americas ("[[Laurasia]]") while it is missing in the southern mythologies of Subsaharan Africa, New Guinea and Australia ("[[Gondwana]]land"). The latter is the older one, going back to the dispersal of [[Homo sapiens]] out of Africa, some 65,000 years ago. Based on these two reconstructions he offers some suggestions about the tales of the (genetic) "[[African Eve]]". Close attention is paid to the largely parallel developments in archaeology, paleontology, genetics and linguistics. He also makes some suggestions about the persistence of these Stone Age myths in current religions.

===Phylogenetical===
It is speculated that like [[genes]], myths evolve by a process of descent with modification. The striking parallels between biological and mythological [[evolution]]&lt;ref&gt;d'Huy 2012a, 2013a, b&lt;/ref&gt; allow the use of [[computational statistics]] to infer evolutionary relatedness and to build the most likely [[phylogenetic tree]] for a mythological family. Mythological phylogenies constructed with [[mytheme]]s clearly support low horizontal transmissions (borrowings), historical (sometimes pre-historic) diffusions and [[punctuated evolution]].&lt;ref&gt;d'Huy 2012b, c; d'Huy 2013a, b, c, d&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, the protoversion could be statistically reconstructed. Mythological phylogenies also are a potentially powerful way to test hypotheses about cross-cultural relationships among [[folklore|folktales]]&lt;ref&gt;Ross and al. 2013; Tehrani 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

==Some mythological parallels==
[[File:Gustave Doré - The Holy Bible - Plate I, The Deluge.jpg|thumb|upright=0.9|''The Deluge'', frontispiece to [[Gustave Doré]]'s illustrated edition of the Bible. Based on the story of [[Noah's Ark]], this engraving shows humans and a tiger doomed by the flood futilely attempting to save their children and cubs.]]
Comparative mythology has uncovered a number of parallels between the myths of different cultures, including some very widespread recurring themes and plot elements.&lt;ref&gt;van der Sluijs (2011) provides a detailed listing of parallels, see van der Sluijs, Marinus Anthony: ''Traditional Cosmologies. The Global Mythology of Cosmic Creation and Destruction''. 2011. London: All Round Publications ([http://www.mythopedia.info/traditionalcosmology-contents.pdf table of contents])&lt;/ref&gt; Here are some examples.

===Flood myth===
{{Main|Flood myth}}
Cultures around the world tell stories about a great flood.&lt;ref&gt;Segal, untitled, p. 88&lt;/ref&gt; In many cases, the flood leaves only one survivor or group of survivors. For example, both the Babylonian ''[[Epic of Gilgamesh]]'' and the [[Hebrew Bible]] tell of a global flood that wiped out humanity and of a man who saved the Earth's species by taking them aboard a boat.&lt;ref&gt;Woolley, p. 52&lt;/ref&gt; Similar stories of a single flood survivor appear in [[Hindu mythology]]&lt;ref&gt;Dimmitt and van Buitenen, pp. 71–74&lt;/ref&gt; as well as [[Ancient Greek flood myths|Greek]], [[Norse mythology]] and [[Aztec mythology]].&lt;ref&gt;Urton, p. 36&lt;/ref&gt;

===The creative sacrifice===
Many cultures have stories about divine figures whose death creates an essential part of reality.&lt;ref name="Eliade Cosmos 20"&gt;Eliade, ''Cosmos and History'', p. 20&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Eliade, ''Myth and Reality'', pp. 99–100&lt;/ref&gt; These myths seem especially common among cultures that grow crops, particularly [[tubers]].&lt;ref&gt;Eliade, ''Myth and Reality'', p. 100&lt;/ref&gt; One such myth from the [[Wemale people]] of [[Seram]] Island, [[Indonesia]], tells of a miraculously-conceived girl named [[Hainuwele]], whose murdered corpse sprouts into the people's staple food crops.&lt;ref&gt;Eliade, ''Myth and Reality'', pp. 104–5&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Chinese mythology|Chinese myth]] of [[Pangu]],&lt;ref&gt;Railsback, ''passim''&lt;/ref&gt; the [[India]]n [[Vedic mythology|Vedic myth]] of [[Purusha]],&lt;ref&gt;''Rig Veda'' 10:90&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Norse mythology|Norse myth]] of [[Ymir]] all tell of a cosmic giant who is killed to create the world.&lt;ref name="Eliade Cosmos 20" /&gt;

===The dying god===
[[File:Dumuzi aux enfers.jpg|thumb|upright=1.3|Ancient Sumerian [[cylinder seal]] impression showing the god [[Dumuzid the Shepherd|Dumuzid]] being tortured in the [[Kur|Underworld]] by ''[[gallu|galla]]'' demons]]
{{Main|Life-death-rebirth deity}}
{{See also|Descent to the underworld|Jesus Christ and comparative mythology}}
Many myths feature a god who dies and often returns to life.&lt;ref&gt;Frankfort, ''passim''; Tortchinov, ''passim''&lt;/ref&gt; Such myths are particularly common in [[Near East]]ern mythologies.&lt;ref&gt;Campbell, ''The Masks of God'', p. 44&lt;/ref&gt; The anthropologist [[Sir James Frazer]] compared these "dying god" myths in his multi-volume work ''[[The Golden Bough]]''. The [[Ancient Egypt|Egyptian]] god [[Osiris]] and the [[Mesopotamian]] god [[Tammuz (deity)|Tammuz]] are examples of the "dying god", while the Greek myths of [[Adonis]] (though a mortal) has often been compared to Osiris and the myth of [[Dionysos]] also features death and rebirth.&lt;ref&gt;Frankfort, p. 141&lt;/ref&gt; Some scholars have noted similarities between polytheistic stories of "dying gods" and the [[Christian]] story of [[Jesus of Nazareth]].&lt;ref&gt;Robertson, ''passim''&lt;/ref&gt;

===The structure of hero stories===
{{See also|Monomyth|Hero}}
A number of scholars have suggested that [[hero]] stories from various cultures have the same underlying structure. Other scholars, including [[FitzRoy Somerset, 4th Baron Raglan]] and, more recently, [[Joseph Campbell]], have also suggested that hero stories share a common structure.&lt;ref&gt;Taylor, p. 118–19&lt;/ref&gt; Some comparative mythologists look for similarities only among hero stories within a specific geographical or ethnic range. For example, the [[Austrians|Austrian]] scholar [[Johann Georg van Hahn]] tried to identify a common structure underlying "[[Aryan]]" hero stories.&lt;ref&gt;Segal, ''Hero Myths'', p. 12&lt;/ref&gt; Others, such as Campbell, propose theories about hero stories in general. According to Campbell's "[[monomyth]]" hypothesis, hero stories from around the world share a common plot structure.&lt;ref&gt;Campbell, ''The Hero with a Thousand Faces'', ''passim''&lt;/ref&gt; Because of its extremely comparative nature, the monomyth hypothesis is currently out of favor with some religious scholars such as Lesley Northup.&lt;ref name="Northup 8" /&gt;

===''Axis mundi''===
{{Main|Axis mundi}}
{{See also|Yggdrasil|Omphalos|Mount Meru}}
Many mythologies mention a place that sits at the center of the world and acts as a point of contact between different levels of the universe.&lt;ref&gt;Eliade, ''Images and Symbols'', p. 40&lt;/ref&gt; This "''[[axis mundi]]''" is often marked by a sacred tree or other mythical object. For example, many myths describe a great tree or pillar joining heaven, earth, and the underworld.&lt;ref&gt;Eliade, ''Shamanism'', p. 259–260&lt;/ref&gt; [[Vedic]] [[India]], ancient [[China]], [[Mayans]], [[Incas]] and the [[Germanic peoples]] all had myths featuring a "Cosmic Tree" whose branches reach heaven and whose roots reach hell.&lt;ref&gt;Eliade, ''Images and Symbols'', p. 44&lt;/ref&gt;

===Titanomachy===
[[File:Cornelis Cornelisz. van Haarlem - The Fall of the Titans - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|upright=1.3|''[[The Fall of the Titans]]'' (1596-98) by [[Cornelis Cornelisz van Haarlem]]]]
{{See also|Titanomachy|Theomachy|Theogony}}
Many cultures have a [[creation myth]] in which a group of younger, more civilized gods conquers and/or struggles against a group of older gods who represent the forces of chaos.

In [[Hindu mythology]], the younger ''[[Deva (Hinduism)|deva]]s'' (gods) battle the older ''[[asura]]s'' (demons),&lt;ref name="Squire 47" /&gt; though both are born from the same father, [[Kashyap]], the grandson of Brahma.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.manuscrypts.com/myth/2011/06/21/kashyapa-1/&lt;/ref&gt;

In the Greek myth of the [[Titanomachy]], the [[Twelve Olympians|Olympian gods]] defeat the [[Titan (mythology)|Titans]], an older and more primitive divine race, and establish cosmic order.&lt;ref name="Squire 47"&gt;Squire, p. 47&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hesiod, especially pp. 64–87&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, the [[Celtic polytheism|Celtic gods]] of life and light struggle against the [[Fomorians]], ancient gods of death and darkness.&lt;ref name="Squire 47" /&gt;

This myth of the gods conquering demons - and order conquering chaos - is especially common in [[Proto-Indo-European religion|Indo-European]] mythologies. Some scholars suggest that the myth reflects the ancient Indo-Europeans' conquest of native peoples during their expansion over Europe and India.&lt;ref&gt;Campbell, ''The Masks of God'', pp. 21–22&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Squire, pp. 69–70&lt;/ref&gt;

===The ''deus otiosus''===
{{See also|Deus otiosus|Sky father|Urmonotheismus}}
Many cultures believe in a celestial [[Supreme Being|supreme being]] who has cut off contact with humanity. Historian [[Mircea Eliade]] calls this supreme being a ''[[deus otiosus]]'' (an "idle god"),&lt;ref&gt;Eliade, ''Myth and Reality'', p. 93&lt;/ref&gt; although this term is also used more broadly, to refer to any god who doesn't interact regularly with humans. In many myths, the Supreme Being withdraws into the heavens after the creation of the world.&lt;ref&gt;Eliade, ''Myth and Reality'', p. 93–98&lt;/ref&gt; [[Baluba mythology]] features such a story, in which the supreme god withdraws from the earth, leaving man to search for him.&lt;ref&gt;Leslau, ''passim''&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, the mythology of the [[Hereros]] tells of a sky god who has abandoned mankind to lesser divinities.&lt;ref&gt;Eliade, ''Myth and Reality'', p. 94&lt;/ref&gt; In the mythologies of highly complex cultures, the supreme being tends to disappear completely, replaced by a strongly [[polytheistic]] belief system.&lt;ref&gt;Eliade, Myths, Dreams and Mysteries, p. 138&lt;/ref&gt;

===Founding myths===
[[File:Maria Saal Dom Grabrelief Romulus und Remus 27122013 774.jpg|thumb|right|upright=1.5|Ancient Roman relief from the [[Maria Saal#Cathedral|Cathedral of Maria Saal]] showing the infant twins [[Romulus and Remus]] being suckled by a she-wolf]]
{{Main|Founding myth}}
{{See also|National myth}}
Many cultures have myths describing the origin of their customs, rituals, and identity. In fact, ancient and traditional societies have often justified their customs by claiming that their gods or mythical heroes established those customs.&lt;ref&gt;Eliade, ''Cosmos and History'', pp. 21–34&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Eliade, ''Myth and Reality'', pp. 6–8&lt;/ref&gt; For example, according to the myths of the [[Australia|Australian]] [[Karadjeri]], the mythical [[Bagadjimbiri]] brothers established all of the Karadjeri's customs, including the position in which they stand while urinating.&lt;ref&gt;Eliade, ''Myth and Reality'', p. 8&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''''Coronation of the Virgin''''' is a painting of the [[Coronation of the Virgin]] by the Italian early Renaissance painter [[Fra Angelico]], executed around 1432. It is now in the [[Uffizi Gallery]] of [[Florence]]. The artist executed another ''[[Coronation of the Virgin (Fra Angelico, Louvre)|Coronation of the Virgin]]'' (c. 1434-1435), now in the [[Louvre]] in [[Paris]].

==History==
The work is mentioned as by Fra Angelico in a manuscript of the Biblioteca Nazionale di Firenze,&lt;ref&gt;Cod. Magliabe., XVII,  17&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Giorgio Vasari]] writes that it was located in the church of Sant'Egidio at Florence. Two panels of the [[predella]] which once was part of the work are known: they portray the ''Marriage'' and the ''Funeral of the Virgin'', and are currently exhibited in the museum of [[San Marco, Florence]].
[[File:Amgelico, matrimonio della vergine, 19x50, predella dell'incoronazione della vergine.jpg|thumb|left|320px|Detail of the predella with the ''Marriage of the Virgin''.]]

The altarpiece arrived at the Uffizi in 1825. The current frame dates to this period.

==Description==
The painting has a gilded background, a heritage of medieval painting, over which is a small paradise where the Coronation is being held.

It portrays Christ crowning the Virgin; both are surrounded by rays (executed through an engraving technique above the gilded background) which symbolize the divine light. The painting has a mystic tone found in other Fra Angelico works, with a large crowd of saints, angels and blessed figures enhancing this aspect. On the left, in the foreground, is St. Egidius, titular of the church which originally housed the work. His face is perhaps modelled over that [[Antonino Pierozzi]], the former prior of the  convent of San Marco, to which Fra Angelico belonged. He is followed by [[Zenobius of Florence]], St. Francis and St. Dominic. On the right side are female saints: among them is a kneeling [[Mary Magdalene]]. In the last rows are musician [[angel]]s. 

The structure of the work and the use of brilliant colors shows the influence of Angelico's master, [[Lorenzo Monaco]], who executed another ''[[Coronation of the Virgin (Lorenzo Monaco)|Coronation of the Virgin]]'', also in the Uffizi.

'''Creative limitation''' is the concept of how purposely limiting oneself can actually drive creativity. At a 2013 [[TED (conference) |TED conference]], artist [[Phil Hansen (artist)|Phil Hansen]] made several remarks concerning the value of limitations, among them that "We need to first be limited in order to become limitless,” and “If you treat the problems as possibilities, life will start to dance with you in the most amazing ways.”&lt;ref name=TED.com group=TED.com&gt;{{cite web|last=May|first=Kate Torgovnick|url=http://blog.ted.com/2013/03/05/can-limitations-make-you-more-creative-a-qa-with-artist-phil-hansen/|title=Can limitations make you more creative? A Q&amp;A with artist Phil Hansen|work=Writer|publisher=TED Blog|accessdate=17 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Creative limitation can also be thought of as a way to achieve a novel effect or goal that is not otherwise possible using [[Convention (norm)|conventional]], readily accessible, methods. [[Igor Stravinsky]] used what he called creative limitation with [[time signature]]s, by restricting himself from using any, in his [[musical composition|composition]] '[[The Rite of Spring]]' as well as in alternate aspects of his other musical works.

{{DISPLAYTITLE:''Deus ex machina''}}
[[File:Medea rappresentation (2009) 07.JPG|thumb|''Deus ex machina'' in classical theatre: Euripides' ''[[Medea (play)|Medea]]'', performed in 2009 in Syracuse, Italy]]

'''''Deus ex machina''''' ({{IPA-la|ˈdeʊs ɛks ˈmaː.kʰɪ.naː|lang}}: {{IPAc-en|ˈ|d|eɪ|.|ə|s|_|ɛ|k|s|_|ˈ|m|ɑː|k|iː|n|ə}} or {{IPAc-en|ˈ|d|iː|ə|s|_|ɛ|k|s|_|ˈ|m|æ|k|ᵻ|n|ə}};&lt;ref&gt;''[[Random House Dictionary]]''&lt;/ref&gt; plural: ''dei ex machina''; English ‘god from the machine’) is a [[plot device]] whereby a seemingly unsolvable problem in a story is suddenly and abruptly resolved by an unexpected and seemingly unlikely occurrence, typically so much as to seem contrived.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite dictionary | title=deus ex machina | dictionary=Merriam-Webster | accessdate=23 Apr 2018 | url=https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/deus%20ex%20machina}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.britannica.com/art/deus-ex-machina | title=Deus ex machina | website=Encyclopaedia Britannica | accessdate=23 Apr 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its function can be to resolve an otherwise irresolvable plot situation, to surprise the audience, to bring the tale to a [[happy ending]], or act as a comedic device.

==Origin of the expression==
''Deus ex machina'' is a Latin [[calque]] {{ety|gre|''ἀπὸ μηχανῆς θεός'' (apò mēkhanês theós)|god from the machine}}.&lt;ref&gt;One of the earliest occurrences of the phrase is in fragment 227 of [[Menander]]: ἀπὸ μηχανῆϛ θεὸς ἐπεφάνηϛ "You are by your epiphany a veritable god from the machine", as quoted in ''The Woman Possessed with a Divinity'', as translated in ''Menander: The Principal Fragments'' (1921) by [[:de:Francis Greenleaf Allinson|Francis Greenleaf Allinson]].&lt;/ref&gt;

The term was coined from the conventions of [[Greek tragedy]], where a machine is used to bring actors playing gods onto the stage. The machine could be either a crane (''[[mechane]]'') used to lower actors from above or a riser that brought actors up through a trapdoor. Preparation to pick up the actors was done behind the ''[[Skene (theatre)|skene]]''. The idea was introduced by [[Aeschylus]] and was used often to resolve the conflict and conclude the drama. Although the device is associated mostly with Greek tragedy, it also appeared in comedies.&lt;ref name="machine"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Chondros |first1=Thomas G. |last2=Milidonis |first2=Kypros|last3=Vitzilaios |first3=George |last4=Vaitsis|first4=John |title="Deus-Ex-Machina" reconstruction in the Athens theater of Dionysus |journal=Mechanism and Machine Theory |date=September 2013 |volume=67 |pages=172–191 |doi=10.1016/j.mechmachtheory.2013.04.010}}&lt;!--|accessdate=15 December 2014--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ancient examples===
[[Aeschylus]] used the device in his ''[[The Eumenides|Eumenides]]'', but it was with [[Euripides]] that it became an established stage machine. More than half of Euripides' extant [[tragedy|tragedies]] employ a ''deus ex machina'' in their resolution, and some critics claim that Euripides, not Aeschylus, invented it.&lt;ref&gt;Rehm (1992, 72) and Walton (1984, 51).&lt;/ref&gt; A frequently cited example is Euripides' ''[[Medea (play)|Medea]]'', in which the ''deus ex machina'', a dragon-drawn chariot sent by the sun god, is used to convey his granddaughter [[Medea]], who has just committed murder and [[infanticide]], away from her husband [[Jason]] to the safety and civilization of Athens. In ''[[Alcestis (play)|Alcestis]]'', the [[eponymous]] heroine agrees to give up her own life in order to spare the life of her husband, Admetus. At the end, [[Heracles]] shows up and seizes Alcestis from [[Thanatos|Death]], restoring her to life and to Admetus.

[[Aristophanes]]' play ''[[Thesmophoriazusae]]'' parodies Euripides' frequent use of the crane by making Euripides himself a character in the play and bringing him on stage by way of the ''mechane''.

The effect of the device on Greek audiences was a direct and immediate emotional response. Audiences would have a feeling of wonder and astonishment at the appearance of the gods, which would often add to the moral effect of the drama.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Cunningham |first1=Maurice P.|title=Medea ΑΠΟ ΜΗΧΑΝΗΣ|journal=Classical Philology |date=July 1954 |volume=49 |issue=3 |pages=151–160 |jstor = 265931 |doi = 10.1086/363788 }}&lt;!--|accessdate=28 September 2014--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

===Modern theatrical examples===
[[Shakespeare]] used the device in ''[[As You Like It]]'', ''[[Pericles, Prince of Tyre]]'', ''[[Cymbeline]]''  and ''[[The Winter's Tale]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Rehm (1992, 70).&lt;/ref&gt; It was also used in John Gay's ''[[The Beggar's Opera]]'' where the author uses a character to break the action and rewrite the ending as a reprieve of the hanging of MacHeath. Both in Shakespeare's and Gay's plays the ''deus ex machina'' happens with breaking the dramatic illusion often in the form of an episodic narrator exposing the play itself and laying bare the author. This is different from the use of the ''deus ex machina'' in the ancient examples with the ending coming from a participant in the action in the form of a god. It is natural for the gods to be considered participants and not outside sources because of their privileged position and power. It is these attributes that allow the Greek gods to believably wrap up and solve the series of events.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Dunn|first1=Francis M|title=Tragedy's End : Closure and Innovation in Euripidean Drama: Closure and Innovation in Euripidean Drama |date=1996 |publisher=Oxford University Press |location=New York, New York}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the politically turbulent 17th and 18th&amp;nbsp;centuries, the ''deus ex machina'' was sometimes used to make a controversial thesis more palatable to the powers of the day. For example, in the final scene of [[Molière]]'s ''[[Tartuffe]]'' the heroes are saved from a terrible fate by an agent of the compassionate, all-seeing [[Louis XIV|king]] — the same king that held Molière's career and livelihood in his hands.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.novelguide.com/a/discover/dfs_18/dfs_18_00023.html "Tartuffe: Novel Guide"]. 2003. Retrieved 2&amp;nbsp;November 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Plot device==
[[Aristotle]] was the first to use a Greek term equivalent to the Latin phrase ''deus ex machina'' as a term to describe the technique as a device to resolve the plot of tragedies.&lt;ref name=machine /&gt; It is generally deemed undesirable in writing and often implies a lack of creativity on the part of the author. The reasons for this are that it does not pay due regard to the story's internal logic (although it is sometimes deliberately used to do this) and is often so unlikely that it challenges [[suspension of disbelief]], allowing the author to conclude the story with an unlikely, though perhaps more palatable, ending.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://web.cn.edu/kwheeler/lit_terms_D.html |title=Literary Terms and Definitions: D |author= Dr. L. Kip Wheeler |accessdate=2008-07-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Examples===
In H. G. Wells's ''[[The War of the Worlds]]'', the Martians, who have destroyed everything in their path and apparently triumphed over humanity, are killed by bacteria.&lt;ref name=Greenwood&gt;{{cite book |editor1-last=Westfahl |editor1-first=Gary |title=The Greenwood Encyclopedia of Science Fiction and Fantasy: Themes, Works, and Wonders, Volume 1 |date=2005 |publisher=Greenwood Publishing Group |isbn=0313329516 |page=[https://books.google.com/books?id=SQMQQyIaACYC&amp;pg=PA195 195] }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the novel ''[[Lord of the Flies]]'', the rescue of the savage children by a passing navy officer (which author [[William Golding]] called a "gimmick") is viewed by some critics as a ''deus ex machina''. The abrupt ending conveys the terrible fate that would have afflicted the children (in particular Ralph) if the officer had not arrived at that moment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=William Golding's Lord of the Flies |editor-last=Bloom |editor-first=Harold |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=j1ZJcFqQ7V8C&amp;pg=PA67&amp;lpg=PA67&amp;dq=Lord+of+the+Flies,+deus+ex+machina |pages=67–68 |chapter=Grief, grief, grief: ''Lord of the Flies'' |first=Lawrence S. |last=Friedman |publisher=Infobase Publishing |year=2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[J. R. R. Tolkien]] referred to the [[Eagle (Middle-earth)|Great Eagles]] that appear in several places in ''[[The Hobbit]]'' and ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'' as "a dangerous 'machine'."&lt;ref&gt;J. R. R. Tolkien, letter 210 as quoted [http://tolkiengateway.net/wiki/Eagles here]&lt;/ref&gt;. This was in a letter refusing permission to a film adapter to have the [[Fellowship of the Ring]] transported by eagles rather than traveling on foot. He felt that the eagles had already been overused as a plot device. For example, in ''[[The Hobbit]]'', the eagles save [[Bilbo Baggins]], [[Gandalf]], and the dwarves from the goblins and wargs, then help turn the tide of the [[Battle of the Five Armies]], and in ''[[The Return of the King]]'' they save [[Frodo Baggins|Frodo]] and [[Samwise Gamgee|Sam]] from certain death on Mount Doom. In the [[Harvard Lampoon]]'s parody [[Bored of the Rings]], the eagles are referred to as 'Deus ex Machina Airlines.'

''Deus ex machina'' was also used by [[Charles Dickens]] in ''[[Oliver Twist]]'', when in the very peak of climax, Rose Maylie turns out to be the long-lost sister of Agnes, and therefore Oliver's aunt; and she marries her long-time sweetheart Harry, allowing Oliver to live happily with his saviour, Mr. Brownlow.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=A Glossary of Literary Terms |editor-last=Abrams |editor-first=MH |url=http://www.barnesandnoble.com/w/glossary-of-literary-terms-m-h-abrams/1100175018?ean=9780495898023 |pages=44–45 |publisher=Harcourt Brace &amp; Company, USA |year=1993 |accessdate=2013-12-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism==
The ''deus ex machina'' device has many criticisms attached to it, mainly referring to it as inartistic, too convenient, and overly simplistic. On the other hand, champions of the device say that it opens up ideological and artistic possibilities.&lt;ref name="ghosts"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Breton |first1=Rob |title=Ghosts in the Machina: Plotting in Chartist and Working-Class Fiction |journal=Victorian Studies |date=Summer 2005 |volume=47 |issue=4 |pages=557–575 |doi=10.1353/vic.2006.0003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ancient criticism===
[[Antiphanes (comic poet)|Antiphanes]] was one of the device's earliest critics. Antiphanes believed that the use of the ''deus ex machina'' was a sign that the playwright was unable to properly manage the complications of his plot. 
{{quote|when they don't know what to say

and have completely given up on the play

just like a finger they lift the machine

and the spectators are satisfied.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{cite web |last1=Handley |first1=Miriam |title=Shaw's response to the deus ex machina: From the Quintessence of Ibsenism to ''Heartbreak House'' |publisher=Theatre: Ancient &amp; Modern, January 1999 Conference |accessdate=20 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Another critical reference to the device can be found in [[Plato]]'s dialogue ''[[Cratylus (dialogue)|Cratylus]]'', 425d, though it is made in the context of an argument unrelated to drama.

[[Aristotle]] criticized the device in his ''[[Poetics (Aristotle)|Poetics]]'', where he argued that the resolution of a plot must arise internally, following from previous action of the play:&lt;ref&gt;Janko (1987, 20)&lt;/ref&gt;
{{quote|In the characters too, exactly as in the structure of the incidents, [the poet] ought always to seek what is either necessary or probable, so that it is either necessary or probable that a person of such-and-such a sort say or do things of the same sort, and it is either necessary or probable that this [incident] happen after that one. It is obvious that the solutions of plots too should come about as a result of the plot itself, and not from a contrivance, as in the ''Medea'' and in the passage about sailing home in the ''[[Iliad]]''. A contrivance must be used for matters outside the drama — either previous events which are beyond human knowledge, or later ones that need to be foretold or announced. For we grant that the gods can see everything. There should be nothing improbable in the incidents; otherwise, it should be outside the tragedy, e.g., that in [[Sophocles]]' ''[[Oedipus Rex|Oedipus]]''. |''[[Poetics (Aristotle)|Poetics]]'' |(1454a33–1454b9) }}

Aristotle praised Euripides, however, for generally ending his plays with bad fortune, which he viewed as correct in tragedy, and somewhat excused the intervention of a deity by suggesting that "astonishment" should be sought in tragic drama:&lt;ref&gt;''Poetics'' 11.5, Penguin (1996, 45).&lt;/ref&gt;
{{quote|Irrationalities should be referred to what people say: That is one solution, and also sometimes that it is not irrational, since it is probable that improbable things will happen.}}

Such a device was referred to by [[Horace]] in his ''[[Ars Poetica (Horace)|Ars Poetica]]'' (lines 191–2), where he instructs poets that they should never resort to a "god from the machine" to resolve their plots "unless a difficulty worthy of a god's unraveling should happen" [''nec deus intersit, nisi dignus uindice nodus inciderit; nec quarta loqui persona laboret''].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.poetryfoundation.org/learning/essay/237830?page=3 |title=Ars Poetica by Horace |date=21 September 2017 |website=Poetry Foundation}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Modern criticism===
Following Aristotle, Renaissance critics continued to view the ''deus ex machina'' as an inept plot device, although it continued to be employed by Renaissance dramatists.

Towards the end of the 19th century, [[Friedrich Nietzsche]] criticized [[Euripides]] for making tragedy an optimistic [[genre]] via use of the device, and was highly skeptical of the "Greek cheerfulness", prompting what he viewed as the plays' "blissful delight in life".&lt;ref&gt;Nietzsche (2003, 85).&lt;/ref&gt; The ''deus ex machina'' as Nietzsche saw it was symptomatic of [[Socrates|Socratic]] culture, which valued knowledge over [[Apollonian and Dionysian|Dionysiac]] music and ultimately caused the death of tragedy:&lt;ref&gt;Nietzsche (2003, 84–86).&lt;/ref&gt;
{{quote| But the new non-Dionysiac spirit is most clearly apparent in the ''endings'' of the new dramas. At the end of the old tragedies there was a sense of metaphysical conciliation without which it is impossible to imagine our taking delight in tragedy; perhaps the conciliatory tones from another world echo most purely in ''[[Oedipus at Colonus]]''. Now, once tragedy had lost the genius of music, tragedy in the strictest sense was dead: for where was that metaphysical consolation now to be found? Hence an earthly resolution for tragic dissonance was sought; the hero, having been adequately tormented by fate, won his well-earned reward in a stately marriage and tokens of divine honour. The hero had become a gladiator, granted freedom once he had been satisfactorily flayed and scarred. Metaphysical consolation had been ousted by the ''deus ex machina''.|Friedrich Nietzsche}}
Nietzsche argued that the ''deus ex machina'' creates a false sense of consolation that ought not to be sought in phenomena.&lt;ref&gt;Nietzsche (2003, 80).&lt;/ref&gt; His denigration of the plot device has prevailed in critical opinion.
 
In [[Arthur Woollgar Verrall]]'s publication ''Euripides the Rationalist'' (1895), he surveyed and recorded other late 19th century responses to the device. He recorded that some of the critical responses to the term referred to it as 'burlesque', 'coup de théâtre', and 'catastrophe'. Verrall notes that critics have a dismissive response to authors who deploy the device in their writings. He comes to the conclusion that critics feel that the ''deus ex machina'' is evidence of the author's attempt to ruin the whole of his work and prevent anyone from putting any importance on his work.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

However, other scholars have looked at Euripides' use of ''deus ex machina'' and described its use as an integral part of the plot designed for a specific purpose. Often Euripides' plays would begin with gods, so it is argued that it would be natural for the gods to finish the action. The conflict throughout Euripides' plays would be caused by the meddling of the gods and therefore would make sense to both the playwright and the audience of the time that the gods would resolve all conflict that they began.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Abel |first1=D. Herbert |title=Euripides' Deus ex Machina: Fault or Excellence |journal=The Classical Journal |date=December 1954 |volume=50 |issue=3 |pages=127–130 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Half of Euripides' eighteen extant plays end with the use of ''deus ex machina'', therefore it was not simply a device to relieve the playwright of the embarrassment of a confusing plot ending. This device enabled him to bring about a natural and more dignified dramatic and tragic ending.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Flickinger |first1=Roy Caston |title=The Greek Theatre and its Drama |date=1926 |publisher=The University of Chicago Press |location=Chicago, Illinois}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other champions of the device believe that it can be a spectacular agent of subversion. It can be used to undercut generic conventions and challenge cultural assumptions and the privileged role of tragedy as a literary/theatrical model.&lt;ref name=ghosts /&gt;

Some 20th-century revisionist criticism suggests that ''deus ex machina'' cannot be viewed in these simplified terms, and contends that the device allows mortals to "probe" their relationship with the divine.&lt;ref name="Rehm 1992, 71"&gt;Rehm (1992, 71).&lt;/ref&gt; [[Rush Rehm]] in particular cites examples of Greek tragedy in which the ''deus ex machina'' complicates the lives and attitudes of characters confronted by the deity, while simultaneously bringing the drama home to its audience.&lt;ref name="Rehm 1992, 71" /&gt; Sometimes, the unlikeliness of the ''deus ex machina'' plot device is employed deliberately. For example, comic effect is created in a scene in ''[[Monty Python's Life of Brian]]'' when Brian, who lives in [[Judea]] at the time of [[Christ]], is saved from a high fall by a passing [[ancient astronauts|alien space ship]].&lt;ref&gt;James Berardinelli, James.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1571">'''Diffuse design''' refers to the designing capability of individuals who are not formally trained as [[Designer|designers]]. Drawing on the natural human ability to adopt a design approach, nonexpert designers bring diffuse design into the world via a combination of [[Critical thinking|critical sense]], [[creativity]], and [[Pragmatism|practical sense]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Manzini|first=Ezio|date=2015-01-02|title=Design in the transition phase: a new design culture for the emerging design|url=https://www.tandfonline.com/action/captchaChallenge?redirectUri=%2Fdoi%2Ffull%2F10.1080%2F14487136.2015.1085683|journal=Design Philosophy Papers|language=en|volume=13|issue=1|pages=57–62|doi=10.1080/14487136.2015.1085683|issn=1448-7136}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Diffuse design was coined by Italian design scholar [[Ezio Manzini]] and was a central theme of his 2015 book ''Design, When Everybody Designs''. Manzini asserts that everybody is endowed with the ability to design, though not everyone is a competent designer and fewer still become professional designers. He also suggests it is the role of expert designers in [[social innovation]] contexts to improve the conditions by which different [[social actors]] can take part in [[co-design]] processes in a more expert fashion.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/904398409|title=Design, when everybody designs : an introduction to design for social innovation|last=Ezio,|first=Manzini,|isbn=9780262328630|location=Cambridge, Massachusetts|oclc=904398409}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Bronze square ding (cauldron) with human faces 02.jpg|thumb|Square ''ding''; the human face is highly unusual decoration]]
'''''Ding''''' ({{lang|zh|鼎}}) are [[prehistoric China|prehistoric]] and [[ancient China|ancient]] [[China|Chinese]] [[cauldron]]s, standing upon legs with a lid and two facing handles. They are one of the most important shapes used in [[Chinese ritual bronze]]s.  They were made in two shapes: round vessels with three legs and rectangular ones with four, the latter often called ''fangding''. They were [[cookware|used for cooking]], storage, and [[animal sacrifice|ritual offerings]] to the [[Chinese mythology|gods]] or to [[ancestor veneration in China|ancestors]]. The earliest recovered examples are pre-[[Shang dynasty|Shang]] [[Chinese ceramics|ceramic]] ding at the [[Erlitou]] site{{sfn|Fong|1980|p=2}} but they are better known from the [[Chinese Bronze Age|Bronze Age]], particularly after the [[Zhou dynasty|Zhou]] deemphasized the ritual use of [[huangjiu|wine]] practiced by the [[list of Shang emperors|Shang kings]].&lt;ref name=CJM&gt;{{cite book|last=Chen|first=Jianming|title=Along the Yangzi River: Regional Culture of the Bronze Age from Hunan|year=2011|publisher=Art Media Resources, Ltd.|location=New York|isbn=978-0-9774054-6-6|pages=23–24|author2=Jay Xu|author3=Fu Juliang}}&lt;/ref&gt; Under the Zhou, the ding and the privilege to perform the associated rituals became symbols of authority.&lt;ref name=Lawton&gt;{{cite book|last=Lawton|first=Thomas|title=Chinese Art of the Warring States Period: Change and Continuity 480-222 B.C.|year=1982|publisher=Smithsonian Institution Press|location=Washington, D.C.|isbn=978-0-934686-39-6 |page=23}}&lt;/ref&gt; The number of permitted ding varied according to one's rank in the [[Chinese nobility]]: the [[Nine Tripod Cauldrons|Nine Ding]] of the [[list of Zhou kings|Zhou kings]] were a symbol of their rule over all China but were lost by the first [[emperor of China|emperor]], [[Shi Huangdi]] in the late 3rd century {{sc|BCE}}.&lt;ref name=botgen&gt;[http://www.chinaculture.org/gb/en_chinaway/2004-08/04/content_57634.htm Food for Thought: Archeological Findings Point to Chinese Dietary Culture&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070204120052/http://www.chinaculture.org/gb/en_chinaway/2004-08/04/content_57634.htm |date=2007-02-04 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Subsequently, imperial authority was represented by the [[Heirloom Seal of the Realm]], carved out of the [[He Shi Bi]] [[Chinese jade|jade]]; it was lost at some point during the [[Five Dynasties and Ten Kingdoms Period|Five Dynasties]] after the collapse of the [[Tang dynasty|Tang]].

==Function and use==
In Chinese history and culture, possession of one or more ancient ding is often associated with power and dominion over the land. Therefore, the ding is often used as an implicit symbolism for power. The term "inquiring of the ding" ({{zh|c=问鼎|p=wèn dǐng}}) is often used interchangeably with the quest for power.
[[File:HK LeiChengUkHanTombMuseum PotteryDingTripod.jpg|thumb|left|Ceramic tripod ding, [[Han Dynasty]]]]

In the early [[Bronze Age]] of China, the use of wine and food vessels served a religious purpose. While ding were the most important food vessels, wine vessels were the more prominent ritual bronzes of this time, likely due to the belief in [[Shamanism]] and spirit worship.{{sfn|Fong|1980|p=8}} Ding were used to make ritual sacrifices, both human and animal, to ancestors. They varied in size, but were generally quite large, indicating that whole animals were likely sacrificed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Allan|first=Sarah|authorlink= Sarah Allan |title=The Shape of the Turtle: Myth, Art, and Cosmos in Early China|year=1991|publisher=State University of New York Press|location=Albany|isbn=0-7914-0459-5|pages=144–145}}&lt;/ref&gt; The sacrifices were meant to appease ancestors due to the Shang belief that spirits had the capability to affect the world of the living.{{sfn|Fong|1980|p=14}} If the ancestors were happy, the living would be blessed with good fortune.

During the [[Zhou Dynasty|Early Western Zhou Dynasty]], the people underwent a political and cultural change. [[King Wu of Zhou]] believed that the Shang people were drunkards. He believed that their over-consumption of wine led their king to lose the [[Mandate of Heaven]], thus leading to the downfall of the Shang dynasty.{{sfn|Fong|1980|p=12}} Because of this belief, food vessels (and ding in particular) replaced wine vessels in importance. Bronze vessels underwent what has been called the "Ritual Revolution."&lt;ref name=CJM/&gt; This theory suggests that because there was a change in decor as well as the types and variations of vessels found in tombs, their function shifted from solely religious to a more secular one. Instead of sacrificing food to appease ancestors, the Zhou used ding to show off the status of the deceased to both the living and spirits.{{sfn|Fong|1980|p=14}} Ding symbolized status. For example, emperors were buried with nine ding, feudal lords with seven, ministers with five, and scholar-bureaucrats with three or one.&lt;ref name=CJM/&gt; The vessels served as symbols of authority for the elite far into the [[Warring States period]].&lt;ref name=Lawton/&gt;

==Form and construction==
[[File:Ding (cooking vessel), China, Shang dynasty, 1300-1046 BC, bronze - Royal Ontario Museum - DSC03993.JPG|thumb|left|Shang dynasty, 1300-1046 BC]]
Like other ritual bronze shapes, the ding was originally an ordinary [[ceramic]] cooking, serving and storage vessel, dating back to the [[Chinese Neolithic]], and ceramic dings continued to be used during and after the period when ceremonial bronze versions were made.  From the time of the [[Shang Dynasty]] in the 2nd millennium&amp;thinsp;{{sc|BCE}}, dings were also cast in [[bronze]] as high-status [[Chinese ritual bronzes|"ritual bronzes"]], which were often buried in the tomb of their owners for use in the afterlife. This is the period to which the oldest examples of bronze dings date. Inscriptions found on dings and [[Bell (instrument)#Ancient Chinese bells|zhongs]] are used to study [[bronzeware script]].

==Theories on construction==
[[File:HouMuWuDingFullView.jpg|thumb|The [[Houmuwu Ding]] is the largest piece of bronze work found from the ancient world so far. It was made in the late Shang dynasty at [[Anyang]].]]
The most commonly believed bronze vessel casting process of ancient Chinese vessels is the piece mold process.  In this process, a model of the finished vessel, complete with décor, is made of clay and left to harden, next a negative of this is made by adding a layer of wet clay to the completed model, and allowed to harden to the point where it can still be cut away from it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Fairbank|first=Wilma|title=Piece-Mold Craftsmanship and Shang Bronze Design|journal=Archives of the Chinese Art Society of America|year=1962|volume=16|pages=9–13|jstor=20067039}}&lt;/ref&gt; The model would then be shaved down to form the core, which would eventually become the empty interior of the completed vessel.  In the final step, the negative layer was replaced around the core, these were held apart by small bronze and copper pieces called chaplets until the molten bronze could be poured into the opening, and fill the empty space between the two layers.  When the bronze had cooled, the clay would be broken away from the vessel, and the process was complete.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Nickel|first=Lukas|title=Imperfect Symmetry: Re-Thinking Bronze Casting Technology in Ancient China|journal=Artibus Asiae|year=2006|volume=66|issue=1|pages=33|jstor=25261842}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A newer variation on the piece mold process was put forth as a way to explain asymmetrical faces on vessels which, as a rule, should be symmetrical.&lt;ref name="Nickel 2006 6–7"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Nickel|first=Lukas|title=Imperfect Symmetry: Re-Thinking Bronze Casting Technology in Ancient China|journal=Artibus Asiae|year=2006|volume=66|issue=1|pages=6–7|jstor=25261842}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was proposed that décor was not made on a model and then transferred to the outer mold layer, but that the décor was carved into and built up on the outer, shell layer as the first step.&lt;ref name="Nickel 2006 6–7"/&gt; Décor was added in a variety of ways.  The first was simply carving and incising lines into the clay mold layer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Nickel|first=Lukas|title=Imperfect Symmetry: Re-Thinking Bronze Casting Technology in Ancient China|journal=Artibus Asiae|year=2006|volume=66|issue=1|pages=14|jstor=25261842}}&lt;/ref&gt; The second was to stamp or press an image, inscription, or design into the wet clay.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Nickel|first=Lukas|title=Imperfect Symmetry: Re-Thinking Bronze Casting Technology in Ancient China|journal=Artibus Asiae|year=2006|volume=66|issue=1|pages=32|jstor=25261842}}&lt;/ref&gt; The third was a technique called tube lining. In this technique, soft, liquid clay would be put into a leather bag, and piped onto a surface through some kind of very fine tube made of metal or bone.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Nickel|first=Lukas|title=Imperfect Symmetry: Re-Thinking Bronze Casting Technology in Ancient China|journal=Artibus Asiae|year=2006|volume=66|issue=1|pages=15–16|jstor=25261842}}&lt;/ref&gt; This technique would have been quite intensive, as it was difficult to maintain constant pressure on the bag, which was needed to create even lines; however, because of certain types of décor, such as thunder or quill patterns, this would have been the most likely technique used to create low relief design in this process.

==Decoration==
[[File:Vessel (fangding), China, Shang dynasty, bronze, Honolulu Academy of Arts.JPG|thumb|Shang fangding with [[taotie]]]]
[[File:Ding (vessel), China, Shang dynasty, c. 1500-1050 BCE, HAA.JPG|thumb|Shang ding, with [[taotie]]]]
Several common themes in decoration span across all types of vessel forms, from hu to pan, and guang to jia.  Arguably, the most frequent, though also the most intriguing and mysterious{{citation needed|date=March 2014}}, form of décor is the two eyed motif, often referred to as the [[taotie]].  This motif can range from something as simple as two protruding half spheres in an otherwise featureless plane, to highly detailed, mask-like faces with various animal features such as snouts, fangs and horns.  In ding vessels, these taotie faces most often appear on the bowl or cauldron portion of the body, but they can also appear on the legs of the vessels.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Delbanco|first=Dawn Ho|title=Art From Ritual: Ancient Chinese Bronze Vessels from the Arthur M. Sackler Collections|year=1983|publisher=The Arthur M. Sackler Foundation|location=Washington D.C.|isbn=0-916724-54-9|pages=72–75}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Decoration also tends to be used to fill in the background of most vessels, sometimes across the entire body of a vessel, but in other instances only a single band of décor is used.  In these backgrounds, whirl or thunder pattern, a low relief spiral design, is used to fill the space and create a texture across the surface of the vessel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Delbanco|first=Dawn Ho|title=Art From Ritual: Ancient Chinese Bronze Vessels from the Arthur M. Sackler Collections|year=1983|publisher=The Arthur M. Sackler Foundation|location=Washington D.C.|isbn=0-916724-54-9|pages=102–107}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In later centuries, fully formed, three-dimensional animal figures, such as cows, goats, birds, dragons, and lions, were occasionally included on bronze vessels.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Delbanco|first=Dawn Ho|title=Art From Ritual: Ancient Chinese Bronze Vessels from the Arthur M. Sackler Collections|year=1983|publisher=The Arthur M. Sackler Foundation|location=Washington D.C.|isbn=0-916724-54-9|pages=132–133}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Some of these animals were purely decorative, while others also had a functional purpose.  In one example, the lid of a Li Ding has three lions lying in relaxed positions, holding rings in their mouths; these rings could have been used to lift the lid off of the vessel when it was hot.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Delbanco|first=Dawn Ho|title=Art From Ritual: Ancient Chinese Bronze Vessels from the Arthur M. Sackler Collections|year=1983|publisher=The Arthur M. Sackler Foundation|location=Washington D.C.|isbn=0-916724-54-9|pages=140}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A final type of decoration, used in most types of vessels, is the inscription.  Inscriptions could be used to identify owner, function, they could be poems or even tell stories. In one example, the Shi Wang Ding, the inscription is used to tell the story of why the ding was created, as well as make a wish for the lineage of the family who owned it.  The Grand Captain's young son Captain Wang says:
"Illustriously august deceased-father Duke Jiu was beautifully capable of making accordant his heart and making wise his virtue, with which he served the past kings, and gained purity without flaw. Wang for the first time has gone on to emulate his august deceased-father,  respectfully morning and night taking out and bringing in the king's commands,  not daring not to follow through or to manage. Because of this, the king has not forgotten the sagely man's descendant,  and has greatly praised his accomplishments and awarded him beneficence.  Wang dares in response to extol the Son of Heaven's
illustriously fine beneficence,  herewith making for my august deceased-father Duke Jiu this offertory caldron; may Captain Wang for ten thousand years have sons' sons and grandsons' grandsons eternally to treasure and use it."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Xu|first=Jay|title=Shi Wang Ding|journal=Art Institute of Chicago Museum Studies|year=2006|volume=32|series=Notable Acquisitions at The Art Institute of Chicago|issue=1|pages=30–31, 95|jstor=4104493}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Historical development==
One of the many types of bronze vessels, the ding vessel had its origins in standard ceramic vessels with the shape of a tripod.&lt;ref&gt;Jessica Rawson, ''Chinese Bronzes: Art and Ritual'' (London: British Museum, 1987), 11.&lt;/ref&gt; A bronze ding vessel from Panlongcheng, Huangpi, Hubei, for example, inherits its shape from Neolithic pottery.&lt;ref&gt;Michael Loewe and Edward L. Shaughnessy, eds., ''The Cambridge History of Ancient China: From the Origins of Civilization to 221 B.C.'' (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1999), 145.&lt;/ref&gt; Perhaps the most famous ancient dings were the legendary [[Nine Tripod Cauldrons]]. This set of bronze vessels is said to have been cast by [[Yu the Great|King Yu]] of the [[Xia Dynasty]] when he divided his territory into the ''Jiuzhou'' or [[Nine Provinces (China)|Nine Provinces]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://afe.easia.columbia.edu/china/art/tch_brnz.htm Art: The Great Bronze Age of China&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070224112212/http://afe.easia.columbia.edu/china/art/tch_brnz.htm |date=2007-02-24 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Woolf2007"&gt;{{cite book|author=Greg Woolf|title=Ancient civilizations: the illustrated guide to belief, mythology, and art|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=94NuSg3tlsgC&amp;dq=ancient+civilizations+the+illustrated+guide+mythology&amp;focus=searchwithinvolume&amp;q=Ding+nine+cauldrons|year=2007|publisher=Barnes &amp; Noble|isbn=978-1-4351-0121-0|page=210}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later on, possession of all nine was considered a sign of rightful authority over [[All Under Heaven|all]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ding.org.cn/news.php?id=453 "A Brief Introduction of the Campaign of Awarding"], 2006-7-6&lt;/ref&gt; The whereabouts of the nine ding are presently unknown, but are said to have been lost during the [[Early Imperial China|imperial]] [[Qin Dynasty]] (221-206&amp;thinsp;{{sc|BCE}}), after having been passed among various royal dynasties and feudal states.&lt;ref name=botgen/&gt;

Ding vessels were used throughout the Shang and [[Zhou Dynasty|Zhou]] dynasties and later time periods.&lt;ref&gt;Jessica Rawson, ''Chinese Bronzes: Art and Ritual'' (London: British Museum, 1987), 97.&lt;/ref&gt; Round, tripod ding vessels are emblematic of the Shang and [[Western Zhou|Western]] and [[Eastern Zhou]] periods.&lt;ref&gt;Xiaoneng Yang, ed., ''The Golden Age of Chinese Archaeology: Celebrated Discoveries from the People's Republic of China'' (Washington, D.C.: National Gallery of Art, 1999), 164.&lt;/ref&gt; Western Zhou ding vessels departed from the Shang aesthetic in terms of their oddly-proportioned legs that were deliberately emphasized through the addition of flanged [[taotie]] motifs.&lt;ref&gt;Dawn Ho Delbanco, ''Art from Ritual: Ancient Chinese Bronze Vessels from the Arthur M. Sackler Collections'' (Cambridge and Washington D.C.: Fogg Museum and Sackler Foundation, 1983), 102.&lt;/ref&gt; In terms of their significance throughout history, bronze vessels came to assume a more political role in later dynasties than in the Shang period.&lt;ref name="Jessica Rawson 1987"&gt;Jessica Rawson, ''Chinese Bronzes: Art and Ritual'' (London: British Museum, 1987), 35.&lt;/ref&gt; Inscriptions cast on Western Zhou ding vessels, for example, commemorate political events and record gifts between monarchs and subjects.&lt;ref name="Jessica Rawson 1987"/&gt;  The [[Da Ke ding]] records a royal award to Ke of royal estate, which is seen as evidence of the breaking up of the estates of old families and their distribution to new families in the transition between different time periods.&lt;ref&gt;Michael Loewe and Edward L. Shaughnessy, eds., ''The Cambridge History of Ancient China: From the Origins of Civilization to 221 B.C.'' (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1999), 328.&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Lidded Ritual Food Cauldron (Ding) with Interlaced Dragons LACMA M.74.103a-b (2 of 5).jpg|thumb|left|[[Shanxi province]], ancient state of [[Jin (Chinese state)|Jin]], Middle [[Eastern Zhou dynasty]], late Spring and Autumn or early Warring States period, about 500-450 BC]]

In Late Western Zhou, sets of ding and [[Gui (vessel)|gui]] were used to indicate rank; a feudal lord would be entitled to nine ding and six gui, while lesser officials were entitled to a smaller number of vessels.&lt;ref&gt;Jessica Rawson, ''Chinese Bronzes: Art and Ritual'' (London: British Museum, 1987), 41.&lt;/ref&gt; Likewise, late Zhou bronzes were often very large, suggesting corresponding wealth.&lt;ref&gt;Michael Loewe and Edward L. Shaughnessy, eds., ''The Cambridge History of Ancient China: From the Origins of Civilization to 221 B.C.'' (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1999), 440.&lt;/ref&gt; Early Eastern Zhou bronzes descended directly from those of Western Zhou.&lt;ref&gt;Jessica Rawson, ''Chinese Bronzes: Art and Ritual'' (London: British Museum, 1987), 47.&lt;/ref&gt; In later times, in the middle [[Warring States period]], the three-legged ding would be one of the most popular ceramic forms imitating bronzes.&lt;ref&gt;Michael Sullivan, ''The Arts of China'' (Berkeley: University of California Press, 2008), 56.&lt;/ref&gt;

In Western China in an area controlled by Qin, small, shallow tripod ding vessels were produced. &lt;ref&gt;Jessica Rawson, ''Chinese Bronzes: Art and Ritual'' (London: British Museum, 1987), 85.&lt;/ref&gt; For these vessels, groups of ceramic and bronze vessels buried together reveal that Western Zhou vessel types continued to exist over different time periods.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Jessica Rawson, ''Chinese Bronzes: Art and Ritual'' (London: British Museum, 1987), 85.&lt;/ref&gt; Tombs at Baoji and Hu Xian, for example, contain sets of ding among others that are shallow and with [[cabriole leg]]s.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; The role of ding vessels in the Zhou period continued, as Qin cemeteries contained ding vessels that expressed rank.&lt;ref&gt;Michael Loewe and Edward L. Shaughnessy, eds., ''The Cambridge History of Ancient China: From the Origins of Civilization to 221 B.C.'' (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1999), 489.&lt;/ref&gt;

Food vessels such as fu, gui, and [[Dui (vessel)|dui]] that were popular in Zhou times disappeared by the [[Han Dynasty|Han dynasty]], during which the ding, zhong, [[Hu (vessel)|hu]], and fang were the main vessel types used.&lt;ref&gt;Zongshu Wang, ''Han Civilization'' (New Haven: Yale University Press, 1982), 102.&lt;/ref&gt; In Western and Eastern Han, the ding was one of the most common bronze-derived shapes in pottery.&lt;ref&gt;Zongshu Wang, ''Han Civilization'' (New Haven: Yale University Press, 1982), 142.&lt;/ref&gt;

Today, the architecture of the [[Shanghai Museum]] is intended to resemble a bronze ding.

The '''Du Pen Fountain''' is a [[water fountain]] at the former [[Joel M. Pritchard Building|Washington State Library]] building on the [[Washington State Capitol]] campus in [[Olympia, Washington]], in the United States. The sculptor, Everett Du Pen (1912–2005),&lt;ref name=obit/&gt; was well known in the Northwest, and chairman of the Sculpture Department at the [[University of Washington]] when he was commissioned for the piece in 1955. The fountain is made of {{convert|900|lb}} of copper-enriched bronze, green [[terrazzo]], and cement.{{sfn|Reynolds|2002|p=71}}&lt;ref name=DESweb/&gt; An element of the fountain is a pair of [[salmon]] spitting water. The fountain, along with the nearby and much larger [[Washington State Capitol#Tivoli Fountain|Tivoli Fountain replica]], is shut down by the state property administration agency during summer droughts.&lt;ref name=DES2015/&gt;&lt;ref name=Schrader2015/&gt; The artist also created the ''[[Fountain of Creation (Seattle)|Fountain of Creation]]'' at the [[Seattle Center]] for the [[1962 World's Fair]].&lt;ref name=artistbio/&gt; The Seattle fountain is also nicknamed Du Pen (or DuPen) Fountain.&lt;ref name=Bhatt2007/&gt;

{{Italic title|reason=[[:Category:Japanese words and phrases]]}}
[[File:enso.jpg|thumb|262px|''Ensō'' (c. 2000) by [[Kanjuro Shibata XX]]. Some artists draw ''ensō'' with an opening in the circle, while others close the circle.]]

In [[Zen]],  {{nihongo|'''''ensō'''''|[[wiktionary:円|円]][[wiktionary:相|相]]|, "circle"}} is a circle that is hand-drawn in one or two uninhibited brushstrokes to express a moment when the mind is free to let the body create.

==Description ==

The ''ensō'' symbolizes absolute [[Enlightenment (spiritual)|enlightenment]], strength, elegance, the universe, and ''[[Mu (negative)|mu]]'' (the void). It is characterised by a [[minimalism]] born of [[Japanese aesthetics]].

Drawing ''ensō'' is a disciplined-creative practice of Japanese ink painting—{{Nihongo|''[[sumi-e]]''|[[wiktionary:墨絵|墨絵]]|"ink painting"}}. The [[Japanese calligraphy#Tools|tools]] and mechanics of drawing the ''ensō'' are the same as those used in traditional [[Japanese calligraphy]]: One uses a {{nihongo|brush|筆|fude}} to apply ink to ''[[washi]]'' (a thin Japanese paper).

The circle may be open or closed. In the former case, the circle is incomplete, allowing for movement and development as well as the perfection of all things. Zen practitioners relate the idea to [[wabi-sabi]], the beauty of imperfection. When the circle is closed, it represents perfection, akin to Plato's perfect form ([[Plato]]), the reason why the circle was used for centuries in the construction of cosmological models, see [[Ptolemy]].

Usually, a person draws the ''ensō'' in one fluid, expressive stroke.  When drawn according to the {{Nihongo|''sōsho''|[[Wiktionary:草書|草書]]}} style of Japanese calligraphy, the brushstroke is especially swift. Once the ''ensō'' is drawn, one does not change it. It evidences the character of its creator and the context of its creation in a brief, continuous period of time. Drawing ''ensō'' is a [[spiritual practice]] that one might perform as often as once per day.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Seo |first=Audrey Yoshiko |date=2007 |title=Ensō: Zen Circles of Enlightenment |location=[[Boston]] |publisher=[[Weatherhill]] |isbn=9780834805750 |oclc=71329980}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This spiritual practice of drawing ''ensō'' or writing Japanese calligraphy for self-realization is called {{Nihongo|''hitsuzendō''|筆禅道|"way of the brush"}}. ''Ensō'' exemplifies the various dimensions of the Japanese ''[[wabi-sabi]]'' perspective and aesthetic: ''Fukinsei'' (asymmetry, irregularity), ''kanso'' (simplicity),  ''koko'' (basic; weathered), ''shizen'' (without pretense; natural), ''yugen'' (subtly profound grace), ''datsuzoku'' (freedom), and ''seijaku'' (tranquility).

In 1995, [[Lucent Technologies]] hired the San Francisco office of [[Landor Associates]], a transnational brand consultancy, to design their brand image.&lt;ref name="aiga"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.aiga.org/content.cfm/the-lucent-logo-legacy-long-live-the-big-red-donut |title=The Lucent Logo Legacy: Long Live the Big Red Donut |last=Bowie |first=James |date=9 May 2006 |website=[[American Institute of Graphic Arts]] |publisher= |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071011015559/http://www.aiga.org/content.cfm/the-lucent-logo-legacy-long-live-the-big-red-donut |archivedate=11 October 2007 |accessdate=25 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the design of the logo, Landor colored an image of an ensō red. The designer intended the brushstroke to imply human creativity, and the red to convey urgency.&lt;ref name="cnnmoney"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://money.cnn.com/magazines/fortune/fortune_archive/1997/03/17/223308/ |title=Elucidating Lucent's "Million-dollar Coffee Stain" |last=McGowan |first=John |date=17 March 1997 |website=[[CNNMoney.com]] |publisher=[[Time Warner]] |accessdate=27 November 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131203045222/http://money.cnn.com/magazines/fortune/fortune_archive/1997/03/17/223308/ |archivedate=3 December 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; They named it the "Innovation Ring". "Our name and symbol represent the new entrepreneurial spirit and vision of our company" reads a [[public relations]] statement from Lucent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.theregister.co.uk/1999/08/10/lucent_logo_captures_company/ |title=Lucent logo captures company in 'single masterful brush stroke' |last=Magee |first=Mike |date=10 August 1999 |website=[[The Register]] |accessdate=27 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In North America, the logo was widely misunderstood.&lt;ref name="aiga"/&gt;&lt;ref name="cnnmoney"/&gt; After years of staying-power and familiarity, the logo became more accepted by industry people in the West (including Lucent's own employees), although it was still not well understood. Nonetheless, soon other logo designers began to be influenced by the work.&lt;ref name="cnnmoney"/&gt; Lucent stopped using the logo after merging with [[Alcatel-Lucent#Alcatel|Alcatel]] of France to form [[Alcatel-Lucent]].

A variation of the symbol was also used as a logo by [[Obaku Ltd.]]. They continue to use an ensō shape as a wristwatch brand.

Thinking, an international design and consulting house centred in London, uses an ensō&lt;ref&gt;thinking.partners&lt;/ref&gt; meaning "Expression" as one of their four icons, along with icons for science, pattern and vision.

Philosopher Joseph Campbell's book, [[The Hero with a Thousand Faces]], bears this symbol on its cover representing creativity and uninhibited freedom of expression within art/literature.

The book [[The Lean Startup]] uses an enso on the cover. One of the concepts in the approach includes a [[learning cycle]] 'Build - Measure - Learn".

The design of [[Apple Campus 2]], [[Apple Inc.]]'s ring-shaped corporate headquarters, might also have been inspired by the ensō.&lt;ref name="Architect's Newspaper"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blog.archpaper.com/wordpress/archives/29794 |title=Zen-otaph: Steve Jobs and the Meaning Behind Apple's New Campus |last=Daly |first=Sean |date=29 December 2011 |website=A/N Blog |accessdate=5 May 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140512235306/http://blog.archpaper.com/wordpress/archives/29794 |archivedate=12 May 2014 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[AMD]] uses an ensō in the marketing of its Ryzen processors with the [[Zen_(microarchitecture)|Zen microarchitecture]].

[[Mindbody_Inc.|MINDBODY]] prominently features an ensō in its company logo.

An '''episode''' is a coherent narrative unit within a larger [[drama]]tic work, such as a radio or television [[serial (radio and television)|series]]. The word derives from the Greek term ({{lang-grc|ἐπεισόδιον}})  (''epeisodion''), meaning the material contained between two songs or [[ode]]s in a Greek [[tragedy]].

== Description ==
An episode is a coherent narrative unit within a larger [[drama]]tic work. It is frequently used to describe units of television or radio [[serial (radio and television)|series]]. An episode is to a sequence as a [[Chapter (books)|chapter]] is to a [[book]]. Modern series episodes typically last 20 to 40 minutes in length.

== Etymology ==
The word derives from the Greek term ({{lang-grc|ἐπεισόδιον}})  (''epeisodion''), meaning the material contained between two songs or [[ode]]s in a Greek [[tragedy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=episode (n.) |url=https://www.etymonline.com/word/episode |website=Online Etymoloy Dictionary |accessdate=17 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Episode is abbreviated as [[wikt:ep|ep]] (''plural'' eps).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3047">In [[folklore]], '''fairy-locks''' (or [[elflocks]]) are the result of fairies tangling and knotting the hairs of the sleeping children as they play in and out of their hair at night.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Batt | first = Tanya Robyn|author2=Gail Newey| title = A child's book of faeries | publisher = Barefoot Books | location = Cambridge, Massachusetts | year = 2002 | isbn = 1841489549 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==English tradition==
The concept is first attested in English in [[Shakespeare]]'s ''[[Romeo and Juliet]]'' in [[Mercutio]]'s speech of the many exploits of [[Queen Mab]], where he seems to imply the locks are only unlucky if combed out:

:"She is the fairies’ midwife, and she comes &lt;br /&gt;
:In shape no bigger than an agate stone....... &lt;br /&gt;

:That plaits the manes of horses in the night &lt;br /&gt;
:And bakes the elflocks in foul sluttish hairs, &lt;br /&gt;
:Which once untangled, much ''misfortune'' bodes."

Therefore, the appellation of elf lock or fairy lock could be attributed to any various tangles and knots of unknown origins appearing in the manes of beasts or hair of sleeping children.

It can also refer to tangles of elflocks or fairy-locks in human hair.  In King Lear, when Edgar impersonates a madman, "he elfs all his hair in knots."&lt;ref&gt;Shakespear's "Lear"&lt;/ref&gt;(Lear, ii. 3.) What Edgar has done, simply put, is made a mess of his hair.

See also ''Jane Eyre'', Ch. XIX; Jane's description of Rochester disguised as a gypsy: "...elf-locks bristled out from beneath a white band..."

==German tradition==
German counterparts of the "elf-lock" are ''alpzopf'', ''drutenzopf'', ''wichtelzopf'', ''weichelzopf'', ''mahrenlocke'', ''elfklatte'', etc. (where [[Alp (folklore)|alp]], [[drude]], [[Mare (folklore)|mare]], and [[wight]] are given as the beings responsible). Grimm, who compiled the list, also remarked on the similarity to [[Holda|Frau Holle]], who entangled people's hair and herself had matted hair.&lt;ref name="Grimm-eng464"&gt;(Stallybrass tr.) {{Harvnb|Grimm|1883|loc=vol. 2, p. 464}}&lt;/ref&gt; The use of the word ''elf'' seems to have declined steadily in English, becoming a rural dialect term, before being revived by translations of fairy tales in the nineteenth century and fantasy fiction in the twentieth.

==French tradition==
Fairy-locks are ascribed in French traditions to the [[lutin]].&lt;ref&gt;Gary R. Butler, ‘The Lutin Tradition in French-Newfoundland Culture: Discourse and Belief’, in ''The Good People: New Fairylore Essays'', ed. by Peter Narváez, Garland Reference Library of the Humanities, 1376 (New York: Garland, 1991), pp. 5–21.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Eastern European tradition ==
{{main|Polish plait#In folklore}}

In Poland and nearby countries, witches and evil spirits were often blamed for [[Polish plait]].  This can be, however, a serious medical condition or an intentional hairstyle.&lt;ref&gt;[[Polish plait#As a hairstyle]]&lt;/ref&gt;{{Better source|reason=per WP:CIRCULAR|date=November 2017}}

'''Fierce Pussy''' (also styled '''fierce pussy''') is a lesbian [[feminist art]] activist collective founded in 1991 in [[New York City]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Fierce Pussy collection 1991-1994|url=http://archives.nypl.org/mss/995|publisher=New York Public Library|accessdate=December 23, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is committed to art action in association with the [[AIDS Coalition to Unleash Power]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.newyorker.com/goings-on-about-town/art/act-up-new-york-activism-art-and-the-aids-crisis-19871993|title=“ACT UP New York: Activism, Art, and the AIDS Crisis, 1987–1993”|website=The New Yorker|access-date=2017-03-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Kim|first=Susie Y.|title=Re-Act: Presenting visual media from the AIDS activist movement, "ACT UP New York" hopes to spark dialogue on campus|url=http://www.thecrimson.com/article/2009/10/16/up-act-students-aids/|accessdate=7 March 2011|newspaper=[[The Harvard Crimson]]|date=16 October 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Background ==
In 1991, a group of [[New York City]] lesbians formed 'fierce pussy' to address issues of lesbian identity and visibility. All of its members were involved in [[ACT UP|AIDS Coalition To Unleash Power]] ([[ACT UP]]) to fight the [[HIV/AIDS|AIDS]] pandemic. Low-tech and low budget, the collective responded to the urgency of those years, using readily available resources: old typewriters, found photographs, their own baby pictures, and the printing supplies and equipment accessible in their day jobs.

Originally fierce pussy was composed of a fluid and often shifting cadre of dykes including Pam Brandt, [[Jean Carlomusto]], Donna Evans, Alison Froling, and [[Suzanne Wright]]. Many other women came to an occasional meeting, and joined in to [[wheat paste]], stencil and sticker. Since 2008, four of the original core members—Nancy Brooks Brody, Joy Episalla, [[Zoe Leonard]], and Carrie Yamaoka—continue to work together.

One of fierce pussy's more well-known projects was the use of wheat-pasted posters and crack-and-peel stickers that were interspersed throughout [[New York City]].  In addition, their other projects included re-designing the bathroom at the Gay and Lesbian Center, a greeting card campaign, a video public service announcement, a moving billboard truck, and renaming the street signs along the [[LGBT Pride March (New York City)|New York City Gay Pride]] route in 1991 after prominent lesbian heroines.  Since 2008, their work has appeared in various installations and exhibitions in [[New York City]]. Their site specific installation, "For The Record", was part of the exhibit ''Greater New York'' in 2015.&lt;ref&gt;http://momaps1.org/exhibitions/view/403 Greater New York 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

==Projects and exhibits==
While Fierce Pussy was most active between 1991 and 1995, their work is still exhibited as historic examples of AIDS-related art and lesbian-identified art.  From 2008 to 2010 at the [[Lesbian Herstory Archives]], fierce pussy presented an overview of their old work in addition to a new installation entitled ''Mining the Archive, ''in which objects from the archive were utilized.  In addition, fierce pussy contributed their display to the [[White Columns]] featured exhibit ''ACT UP New York: Activism, Art, and the AIDS crisis, 1987-1993''. This exhibition was revived at [[Harvard University]]'s [[Carpenter Center for the Visual Arts]] in 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Kivrak|first=Pelin|author2=Sonia Coman|title=Act Up Revived at Harvard: In the Carpenter Center for the Visual Arts, ignorance is not bliss|url=http://www.harvardindependent.com/?p=159|accessdate=7 March 2011|newspaper=[[The Harvard Independent]]|date=16 November 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;  When the exhibition moved to [[White Columns]], they were commissioned to make the installation called "Get Up Everybody and Sing."  In 2010, fierce pussy created "Get Up Everybody and Sing" for the [[White Columns]] presentation of the ACT UP New York exhibition; in 2015, VisualAIDS made this exhibit available under the name "For the Record".  Fierce pussy has made an overview retrospective of their older work available at [[Printed Matter, Inc|Printed Matter]], which also published the book ''fierce pussy''.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10866">The '''German Fairy Tale Route'''&lt;ref name="DMS"&gt;This is the official name used on the website - see [http://www.deutsche-maerchenstrasse.com/en/?lang=en ''Portrait'']. However, many English sources also call it the "German Fairy Tale Road".&lt;/ref&gt; ({{lang-de|Deutsche Märchenstraße}}) is a [[tourist]] attraction in [[Germany]] originally established in 1975. With a length of {{convert|600|km|mi}},&lt;ref&gt;''German Fairy Tale Route'' brochure, Deutsche Märchenstraße e.V., Kassel, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; the route runs from [[Hanau]] in central Germany to [[Bremen]] in the north. Tourist attractions along the route are focused around the brothers [[Wilhelm Grimm|Wilhelm]] and [[Jacob Grimm]], including locations where they lived and worked at various stages in their life, as well as regions which are linked to the [[fairy tale]]s found in the [[Grimm's Fairy Tales|Grimm collection]], such as [[The Town Musicians of Bremen]]. The ''Verein Deutsche Märchenstraße'' society, headquartered in the city of Kassel, is responsible for the route, which travellers can recognize with the help of road signs depicting the heart-shaped head of a pretty, fairylike creature.&lt;ref&gt;[http://deutsche-maerchenstrasse.com/de/presse/index.html Presseinfos des Vereins: „10.04.2010 - Presse-Basis-Info“ (PDF)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110615073658/http://deutsche-maerchenstrasse.com/de/presse/index.html |date=2011-06-15 }} (checked on July 8, 2010, in German only)&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Hanau Bruder Grimm.jpg|thumb|Brothers Grimm Memorial in Hanau, by [[Syrius Eberle]]]]

==Tourist attractions==
The German Fairy Tale Route passes through various scenic regions, which include eight nature parks including the [[Hesse|Hessian]] [[Spessart Nature Park]], [[Hoher Vogelsberg]] Nature Park, Kellerwald-Edersee Nature Park, Meißner-[[Kaufungen Forest]] Nature Park, [[Habichtswald]] Nature Park and the [[Weser Uplands-Schaumburg-Hamelin Nature Park|Weser Uplands Nature Park]].
The towns and cities associated with the [[Brothers Grimm]] and located along the route are Hanau, Steinau, Marburg and Kassel. The original ''Children’s and Household Tales'' (German: ''Kinder- und Hausmärchen''), edited and published by Jacob and Wilhelm Grimm in 1812 and known today as ''Grimm’s Fairy Tales'' (German: ''Grimms Märchen''), can be found in Kassel. In 2005, this collection was added to the [[UNESCO World Document Heritage List]]. Several places along the Fairy Tale Route are connected with the fairy tales themselves. In the town of [[Alsfeld]], visitors can see what is known as the House of [[Little Red Riding Hood]] (''Rotkäppchenhaus''); the spa Bad Wildungen offers a [[Snow White]] Museum (''Schneewittchen Museum''); and Dorothea Viehmann, from whom the Grimms learned about many of the fairy tales found in their collection, was born in what today is the community of Baunatal. According to legend, the hill Hoher Meissner is where Mother Hulda is said to have resided; Sababurg Castle, located in Reinhardswald Park, is referred to as the [[Sleeping Beauty Castle]]. Further attractions include the town of Hamelin, of [[Pied Piper of Hamelin|Pied Piper]] fame; the spa of Bad Oeynhausen, which has a museum devoted to fairy tales and local legends (''Deutsches Märchen- und Wesersagenmuseum''); and the city of Bremen, which is famous for the tale of the [[Town Musicians of Bremen]].

Numerous picturesque medieval towns can be found among the Route's attractions as well. In 1975, the Council of Europe awarded [[Alsfeld]] the status of a model European community for the conservation of historic buildings. The old centre of the town of Hann. Münden comprises roughly 700 half-timbered houses; the 1300-year-old town of Fritzlar is famous for its imperial cathedral; and [[Hamelin]] contains beautiful examples of [[Weser Renaissance]] architecture.

The baroque grounds of [[Philippsruhe Castle]] in [[Hanau, Germany|Hanau]], the fountain displays in the Hillside Park of [[Kassel-Wilhelmshöhe]], as well as the [[Bremen Town Hall]] with the adjacent statue of Roland (both of which are on the UNESCO World Heritage List) are also of particular interest. The 200th anniversary of the first publication of '''''Children's and Household Tales''''' by the Brothers Grimm was observed in 2012-2013 with a series of events. Many other events, open-air festivals, exhibits, and performances dealing with the topic of fairy tales are held annually.

'''Harold Rubin''' (born 13 May 1932) is a South African-born [[Israel]]i [[visual artist]] and [[free jazz]] [[clarinettist]].

==Biography==
Harold Rubin was born in [[Johannesburg]], South Africa on 13 May 1932. He attended the [[Jeppe High School for Boys]] and received private instruction in the [[fine arts]].&lt;ref name = "Berman 1970"&gt;"Rubin, Harold" (1970). In Esmé Berman (Ed.), ''Art and Artists of South Africa: An Illustrated Biographical Dictionary and Historical Survey of Painters and Graphic Artists Since 1875'', Third Edition. Cape Town: A. A. Balkema. p. 115.&lt;/ref&gt; Instructed in the [[Classical music|classical]] [[clarinet]] as a teenager, he developed a fascination with [[jazz]] and began playing at the Skyline Night Club at eighteen. Enrolled as an architecture student at the [[University of the Witwatersrand]], he completed his professional studies after further education in London.

Rubin's creative endeavours in South African society during the 1950s and 1960s dissented against the [[apartheid]]-era [[Afrikaner]] establishment by defying the country's racist social norms. Rubin organised his own jazz group in the 1950s, snuck into [[Township (South Africa)|black townships]], and played alongside black musicians. Rubin's visual artwork was first exhibited in 1956.&lt;ref name = "Berman 1970"/&gt; Among Rubin's contributions to the South African fine arts in this spirit was the 1961 ''Sharpeville'', a series of drawings devoted to the brutality of the Apartheid-era authorities during the [[Sharpeville massacre]] in 1960.

Rubin's most controversial project on the South African art scene of the 1960s was ''My Jesus'', a provocative rendering of the [[crucifixion]] in which [[Jesus Christ]] appeared as a nude black figure with the head of a monster.&lt;ref name = "The Black Christ intro"&gt;Martin, Marilyn (2006).

Retrieved 21 May 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; Rubin became the second South African to be charged with [[blasphemy]].&lt;ref name = "The Age 9 Feb 1968, page 3"/&gt;

Acquitted in court of the alleged blasphemy in March 1963, Rubin protested the repressive political environment by leaving the country for [[Israel]] and quickly re-established himself in [[Tel Aviv]]. Rubin was employed as an architect, in the office of [[Arieh Sharon]], on projects in Israel and abroad and taught at an academy of architecture and design between the 1960s and his retirement in 1986.

Rubin began creating visual art as a critique and commentary on the [[militaristic]] aspect of Israeli society as early as the 1960s. The anti-war subject was a prime subject of Rubin's work during the 1980s – a decade witnessing the [[1982 Lebanon War|1982 invasion of Lebanon]] and the tensions aroused by the increasingly visible [[Israeli peace camp|peace movement]], and marked by the creation of such works as ''The Anatomy of a War Widow'' (1984), a series of twenty-two black-and-white pictures. The caustic ''Homage to Rabbi Kahane'', which portrayed the outspoken [[ultra-nationalist]] [[Rabbi]] [[Meir Kahane]] as a Jewish [[Nazi]], was pulled off the wall by a [[Knesset]] member when hung at a [[Haifa]] gallery in 1985.&lt;ref name = "Shipler"&gt;Shipler, David (2002).

Retrieved 21 May 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; Rubin's drawings and paintings have been exhibited in Israel, South Africa, the United States, and Germany since the 1960s.

Rubin returned to playing jazz in late 1979, having previously given up performance for more than a decade after his emigration from Africa. He became a founding member of the 1980s [[Zaviot]] [[jazz quartet]], which recorded albums with the label [[Jazzis Records]] and performed at festivals and clubs in Israel and Europe until its break-up in 1989. Rubin's more recent appearances have include performances with [[Ariel Shibolet]], [[Assif Tsahar]], [[Daniel Sarid]], [[Maya Dunietz]], and [[Yoni Silver]].&lt;ref name = "Ben Shalev Ha'aretz"&gt;{{cite news|author=Shalev, Ben|title=It's Important to be a Neanderthal|publisher=''[[Ha'aretz]]''|date=28 February 2008|url=http://www.haaretz.com/general/it-s-important-to-be-a-neanderthal-1.240349|accessdate=22 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Harold Rubin and his first wife, Riva Wainer, married in 1957, separated in the 1970s and divorced in 1975.

'''Jan van Kessel the Elder''' or '''Jan van Kessel (I)''' (baptized 5 April 1626, [[Antwerp]] &amp;ndash; 17 April 1679, Antwerp) was a Flemish painter active in Antwerp in the mid 17the century. A versatile artist he practised in many genres including studies of insects, floral still lifes, marines, river landscapes, paradise landscapes, allegorical compositions, scenes with animals and [[genre art|genre scenes]].&lt;ref name=rkd&gt;[https://rkd.nl/nl/explore/artists/44093 Jan van Kessel (I)] at the [[Netherlands Institute for Art History]] {{link language|nl|Middle Dutch}}&lt;/ref&gt; A scion of the Brueghel family many of his subjects took inspiration of the work of his grandfather [[Jan Brueghel the Elder]] as well as from the earlier generation of Flemish painters such as [[Daniel Seghers]], [[Joris Hoefnagel]] and [[Frans Snyders]].&lt;ref name=ox&gt;W. Laureyssens. "Kessel, van." Grove Art Online. Oxford Art Online. Oxford University Press. Web. 17 Jan. 2017&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==
[[File:Jan van Kessel (I) - A sprig of redcurrants with an elephant hawk moth, a ladybird, a millipede and other insects.jpg |thumbnail|thumb|288px|'' A sprig of redcurrants with an elephant hawk moth, a ladybird, a millipede and other insects'']]
Jan van Kessel the Elder was born in Antwerp as the son of [[Hieronymus van Kessel the Younger]] and Paschasia Brueghel (the daughter of [[Jan Brueghel the Elder]]).  He was thus Jan Brueghel the Elder's grandson, [[Pieter Bruegel the Elder]]'s great-grandson and the nephew of [[Jan Brueghel the Younger]]). His direct ancestors in the van Kessel family line were his grandfather [[Hieronymus van Kessel the Elder]] and his father Hieronymus van Kessel the Younger, who were both painters.  Very little is known about the work of these van Kessel ancestors.&lt;ref name=bran&gt;Frans Jozef Peter Van den Branden, ''Geschiedenis der Antwerpsche schilderschool'', Antwerpen, 1883, p. 1098-1101 {{link language|nl|Middle Dutch}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the age of only 9, Jan van Kessel was sent to study with the history painter [[Simon de Vos]].&lt;ref name=bran/&gt;  He further trained with family members who were artists.  He was a pupil of his father and his uncle [[Jan Brueghel the Younger]].&lt;ref name=rkd/&gt;

In 1644 he became a member of the Antwerp [[Guild of Saint Luke]] where he was recorded as a "blomschilder" (flower painter).&lt;ref name=rkd/&gt;  He married Maria van Apshoven on 11 June 1646.  The couple had 13 children of whom two, [[Jan van Kessel the Younger|Jan]] and [[Ferdinand van Kessel|Ferdinand]], were trained by him and became successful painters.  He was captain of a local [[schutterij]] (civil guard) in Antwerp.&lt;ref name=bran/&gt;

Jan van Kessel was financially successful as his works commanded high prices.&lt;ref name=bie&gt;Johannes van Kessel, page 409, in Cornelis de Bie, ''[[Het Gulden Cabinet]]'', 1662&lt;/ref&gt; He bought in 1656 a house called the Witte en Roode Roos (White and Red Rose) in central Antwerp.  By the time his wife died in 1678 his fortune seems to have turned for the worse. In 1679 he had to mortgage his house.  He had become too ill to paint and died on 17 April 1679 in Antwerp.&lt;ref name=bran/&gt;

He trained other painters and also his own family members. His pupils included his sons [[Jan van Kessel the Younger|Jan]] and [[Ferdinand van Kessel|Ferdinand]].&lt;ref name=rkd/&gt;

==Work==
===General===
[[File:Jan van Kessel (I) - A River Landscape with Figures on a Track.jpg|290px|thumb|'' A River Landscape with Figures on a Track'']]
Jan van Kessel the Elder's dated works range from 1648 to 1676.&lt;ref name=chris&gt;[http://www.christies.com/LotFinder/lot_details.aspx?intObjectID=5460677 Jan van Kessel (Antwerp 1626-1679), ''Grapes, peaches, cranberries, flowers and butterflies, in a porcelain bowl on a wooden ledge; and Grapes, blackberries, cherries, butterflies and a walnut in a porcelain bowl on a wooden ledge''] at Christie's&lt;/ref&gt; Attribution of work to Jan van Kessel the Elder has been difficult due to confusion with other artists with a similar name all active around the same time.  In addition to his son Jan, there was another Antwerp painter with the name Jan van Kessel (referred to as [['the other' Jan van Kessel]]) who painted still lifes, while in Amsterdam there was a [[Jan van Kessel (Amsterdam)|Jan van Kessel]] known as a landscape painter.  To complicate things further, while he is usually referred to as Jan van Kessel I since he had an uncle also called Jan van Kessel he is sometimes referred to as Jan van Kessel II and his son Jan van Kessel the Younger as Jan van Kessel III.&lt;ref name=ni&gt;[https://rkd.nl/en/explore/artists/44094 Jan van Kessel the Younger] at the [[Netherlands Institute for Art History]] {{link language|nl|Middle Dutch}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://explore.rkd.nl/explore/artists/237496 'the other' Jan van Kessel] at the Netherlands Institute for Art History {{link language|nl|Middle Dutch}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://explore.rkd.nl/explore/artists/44092 Jan van Kessel (of Amsterdam)] at the Netherlands Institute for Art History {{link language|nl|Middle Dutch}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Another problem for attributions has been the fact that Jan van Kessel the Elder used two different styles of signature on his work.  He used a cursive, more decorative signature for larger formats, which would have been difficult to read in a smaller painting.  This practice lead to the erroneous assumption that these works were made by two different painters.&lt;ref name=ox/&gt;

Jan van Kessel specialized in small-scale pictures of subjects gleaned from the natural world such as floral still lifes and allegorical series showing animal kingdoms, the four elements, the senses, or the parts of the world. Obsessed with picturesque detail, van Kessel worked from nature and used illustrated scientific texts as sources for filling his pictures with objects represented with almost scientific accuracy.&lt;ref name=cris&gt;[http://www.christies.com/LotFinder/lot_details.aspx?intObjectID=5101843 Jan van Kessel (Antwerp 1626-1679), ''Roses, tulips, an iris and other flowers, in a glass vase on a stone plinth, with butterflies and other insects''] at Christie's&lt;/ref&gt;

===Nature studies===
Jan van Kessel produced a great number of studies of animals such as insects, caterpillars and reptiles as well as images of flowers and rare objects from all over the known world.&lt;ref name=soth&gt;[http://www.sothebys.com/en/auctions/ecatalogue/2014/masterworks-mellon-n09245/lot.31.html Jan van Kessel (I), ''A still life study of insects on a sprig of rosemary with butterflies, a bumble bee, beetles and other insects''] at Sotheby's&lt;/ref&gt; He showed himself to be a keen observer and his animal studies were praised in his day for their meticulousness and precision.&lt;ref name=bie/&gt;  His work in this field reflects the contemporary worldview in which the appreciation of art and nature went hand in hand.  That same desire to collect and categorize the natural world, which had given impetus to the creation of the [[Cabinet of curiosities|Kunstkammern]] and Wunderkammern in the late 16th and 17th century, inspired the artists of the day to achieve the same in painted form.&lt;ref name=soth/&gt;  Jan van Kessel's grandfather Jan Brueghel the Elder had already demonstrated in his work how artists, starting from empirical observation, could represent the world through ordering and classifying its many elements.&lt;ref&gt;Arianne Faber Kolb, ''Jan Brueghel the Elder: The Entry of the Animals into Noah’s Ark'', Getty Publications, 2005, p.47&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:'Butterflies, Other Insects, and Flowers' by Jan van Kessel, 1659, High Museum of Art.jpg|thumb|290px|left|''Butterflies, other insects and flowers'']]

An important influence on his animal studies was the scientific naturalism of the Flemish artist [[Joris Hoefnagel]] known primarily for his illuminated manuscripts and still lifes on vellum. Hoefnagel's studies of flowers and insects were engraved and published under the title ''Archetypa studiaque patris Georgii Hoefnagelii'' by his son [[Jacob Hoefnagel]] in 1592 in Frankfurt. The book is a collection of 48 engravings of plants, insects and small animals shown ''ad vivum'' made after studies by Joris Hoefnagel and was very influential on next generations of animal painters.&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.org/details/diversaeinsectar00hoef The ''Archetypa studiaque patris Georgii Hoefnagelii''] at archive.org&lt;/ref&gt;

Van Kessel's animal studies distinguish themselves from the dispassionate approach of his predecessors, who arranged the various flora and fauna in rows, as if they were specimens in a collector’s cabinet.  Van Kessel put greater emphasis on composition and aesthetic without abandoning an accurate depiction of the individual creature in question.  An example of this approach is the work [[:File:Jan van Kessel (I) - A still life study of insects on a sprig of rosemary with butterflies, a bumble bee, beetles and other insects.jpg|''A still life study of insects on a sprig of rosemary with butterflies, a bumble bee, beetles and other insects'']] (Sotheby's 10 November 2014, New York, lot 31).  In this composition van Kessel created a dynamic arrangement with insects around a single sprig of rosemary, which gives the illusion that the butterflies and bee are conversing.  Despite the absence of a moralizing text, as found in the Archetypa of Hoefnagel, van Kessel's message of nature as a mirror of God’s power would have been clear to his audience.&lt;ref name=soth/&gt;&lt;ref name=soto&gt;[http://www.sothebys.com/en/auctions/ecatalogue/2013/old-master-british-paintings-evening-l13033/lot.11.html Jan van Kessel, ''Study of insects, butterflies and a snail with a sprig of forget-me-nots; study of butterflies and other insects with a sprig of apple blossom''] at Sotheby's&lt;/ref&gt;

His studies of flora and fauna were often executed in large sets and occasionally served as the drawer fronts of collector's cabinets that were used for displaying objects in Wunderkammern. Unlike the dried and pinned samples stored within these cabinets, van Kessel’s painted subjects appear very much alive and are clearly intended to surprise and delight the viewer upon opening the outer doors.&lt;ref name=soth/&gt; Jan van Kessel started painting these works in the first half of the 1650s and the earliest dated examples were painted in 1653. While some of these works were executed on panel, the majority were painted on copper. Copper provided the smooth surface best suited to his meticulous and detailed finish.&lt;ref name=soto/&gt;

===Garland paintings===

Van Kessel's grandfather Jan Brueghel the Elder played a key role in the invention and development of the genre of garland paintings in the first two decades of the 17th century.  Garland paintings typically show a flower garland around a devotional image or portrait.&lt;ref name=merriam&gt;Susan Merriam, ''Seventeenth-Century Flemish Garland Paintings. Still Life, Vision and the Devotional Image'', Ashgate Publishing, Ltd., 2012&lt;/ref&gt;  Other artists involved in the early development of the genre included [[Hendrick van Balen]], [[Andries Daniels]], [[Peter Paul Rubens]] and Daniel Seghers. The genre was initially connected to the visual imagery of the [[Counter-Reformation]] movement.&lt;ref name="freedberg"&gt;David Freedberg, "The Origins and Rise of the Flemish Madonnas in Flower Garlands, Decoration and Devotion", ''Münchener Jahrbuch der bildenden Kunst'', xxxii, 1981, pp. 115–150.&lt;/ref&gt; The genre was further inspired by the cult of veneration and devotion to [[Mary (mother of Jesus)|Mary]] prevalent at the [[Habsburg]] court (then the rulers over the Southern Netherlands) and in Antwerp generally. The earliest specimens of the genre often include a devotional image of Mary in the cartouche but in later examples the image in the cartouche could be religious as well as secular.&lt;ref name="merriam"/&gt;&lt;ref name="freedberg"/&gt;

Garland paintings were usually collaborations between a still life and a figure painter.  Van Kessel would typically paint the surrounding still life while a figure painter was responsible for the figure or other image in the cartouche.  His collaborators on garland paintings are believed to have included his uncle [[David Teniers the Younger]], [[Erasmus Quellinus I|Erasmus Quellinus the Elder]], [[Hendrick van Balen]] the Elder, [[Thomas Willeboirts Bosschaert]] and possibly [[Jan Boeckhorst]].

An example of a collaborative garland painting made by Jan van Kessel and David Teniers the Younger is the composition [[:File:Kessel, Jan van - The Soap Bubbles - 1660s.jpg|''The Soap Bubbles'']] (c. 1660-1670, [[Louvre]]).  In this work Jan van Kessel painted a decorative garland representing the [[Classical element|four elements]] around a cartouche showing a young man blowing soap bubbles, which symbolizes [[vanity]], i.e. the transience of life.&lt;ref&gt;[http://cartelfr.louvre.fr/cartelfr/visite?srv=car_not_frame&amp;idNotice=25405 Jan van KESSEL, ''Les Bulles de savon''] at the Louvre {{link language|fr|French}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''John Berney''' (or '''Barney''') '''Crome''' (1 December 1794 &amp;ndash; 15 September 1842) was an English [[Landscape painting|landscape]] and [[Marine art|marine]] painter associated with the [[Norwich School of painters]]. He is sometimes known by the nickname ''''Young Crome'''' to distinguish him from his father John, known as '[[Old Crome]]'.

==Early life==
[[File:John Berney Crome.jpg|thumb|John Berney Crome, c.1820]]
John Berney Crome was born in [[Norwich]], [[Norfolk]], on 1 December 1794,&lt;ref&gt;Holme, ''The Norwich School'', pp. 27-8.&lt;/ref&gt; the eldest of the seven surviving children of John Crome (1768–1821), painter, and his wife, Phoebe Berney. His father was a distinguished landscape artist and a founder of the Norwich Society of Artists. 

Realising his own educational deficiency, he determined his son should have a good education, and John Berney Crome attended [[Norwich School (independent school)|Norwich School]] – the Grammar School - until he was eighteen. He was educated when Dr. Samuel Forster and the Rev. Edward Valpy were headmasters at the school.&lt;ref name="DNB" /&gt; At the same time, with ambitions of becoming an artist, he accompanied his father on sketching expeditions. In 1816 he went with his school friend George Vincent, and a doctor, Benjamin Steel (who afterwards married Crome’s sister) on an excursion to Paris.

==Artistic career==
Crome assisted his father in teaching and was appointed as landscape painter to the [[Prince Augustus Frederick, Duke of Sussex|Duke of Sussex]]. He became a member of the Norwich Society of Artists and exhibited many of his pictures there between 1806 and 1830. He was appointed Vice-President of the Society in 1818, and subsequently President on several occasions. 

On the death of John Crome in April 1821, John Berney Crome continued his father's art teaching practice and occupied the family house in Gildengate Street, Norwich, to which he added a studio. In conjunction with [[John Sell Cotman]], he took a lively interest in the Norwich Society of Artists in 1828, which had closed in 1825 after the demolition of its old premises. Between 1811 and 1843 he had many works exhibited at the [[Royal Academy]], [[British Institution]] and [[Society of British Artists]] in London, and made trips to the continent, drawing and painting in France, Holland, Belgium and Italy. His work shows the influence of his father, and like his father he painted many moonlight effects, his 1834 ''River Scene By Moonlight'' being a prime example.

As a result of his extravagant habits, Crome was made [[bankrupt]] in 1831, and the contents of his father's house had to be sold off. Many paintings made by both father and son were disposed of at this time. He subsequently moved to [[Great Yarmouth]] in 1835, where he continued to teach drawing. An 'incurable illness'&lt;ref name="DNB" /&gt; was the cause of his death on 15 September 1842.

Crome was twice married, but had no children.&lt;ref name="DNB" /&gt; He was known as a man of genial character and jovial disposition, and his portrait, one of two executed by H B Love, hangs in the Castle Museum, Norwich.

[[File:Paintings in the Tide and Time Museum, Great Yarmouth.jpg|thumb|Paintings in the Tide and Time Museum, [[Great Yarmouth]], icluding Crome's ''Removal of Old Yarmouth Bridge'' (1837)]]
John Berney Crome worked in [[oil painting|oils]], [[watercolours]] and pencil, painting [[Marine painting|coastal]] and rural scenes, both at home and abroad. He made frequent visits to the continent, and the subjects of some of his pictures were taken from places in France, Holland, Belgium, and Italy.&lt;ref name="DNB"&gt;{{cite DNB|wstitle=Crome, John Bernay|volume=13|pages=143-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Crome's paintings can bear a strong resemblance to those of his father, and also of fellow Norwich School artist [[George Vincent (painter)|George Vincent]], and their works have at times been confused with each others.&lt;ref&gt;Cundall, ''The Norwich School'', p. 6.&lt;/ref&gt;

Between 1811 and 1843 he exhibited seven works at the Royal Academy, thirty-five at the British Institution, and fifty-five at the Society of British Artists.&lt;ref name="DNB" /&gt; Many of his works were exhibited at the Edinburgh Society of Artists and the Society of British Artists. Norfolk Museums has a significant collection of his work, most housed in the Castle Museum, and his paintings are also currently kept by the Tate Gallery, the Yale Centre for British Art, the UK Government Art Collection, the Sheffield Museums, the Royal Albert Memorial Museum, Oxford Town Hall, the Williamson Art Gallery &amp; Museum, the Barber Institute of Fine Arts, and the English Heritage Collection, Kenwood.

While John Berney Crome’s paintings have never reached the status associated with the great English landscape artists, some have fetched almost $10,000, and in 2018 a relatively small (perhaps 37cm by 32cm) oil on canvas painting of a shoreline landscape marine scene was offered for sale through Madrigallery in the USA for $35,000.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3661">'''Magnetic Field Architecture''' (MFA) is based on [[Lenz's law | Lenz’s Law]], which states that if a [[magnetic field]] moves relative to a conductor, an [[eddy current]] is generated in that conductor. The technology uses engines to generate a primary magnetic field. These, in turn, create eddy currents, which generate a magnetic field of their own, mirroring the primary field causing them to repel one another. By focusing this electromagnetic energy downward, they are capable of generating [[Lift (force) | lift]].

[[File:Eddy currents due to magnet.svg|thumb|Eddy currents due to magnets.]]

== Conception ==
Architect Greg Henderson had been searching for better ways to build safer and more sustainable structures that could withstand the destructive force of earthquakes. In 2015, he was granted a patent for the magnetic levitation of a moving or stationary object. This marked an advancement from present forms of earthquake protection such as base isolation.


Henderson's MFA uses electromagnetic fields to separate an object or structure from the ground and enable propulsion and control.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/aarontilley/2014/10/21/hendo-hoverboard/#267bf6cb5656|title=Architect's Dream Of Levitating Houses Turns Into A Hoverboard|last=Tilley|first=Aaron|website=Forbes|accessdate=2016-04-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; With the understanding that MFA had applications beyond structural isolation, Greg founded the Silicon Valley technology company, [[Arx Pax Labs, Inc.|Arx Pax]], and invented and patented (Patent No: US 9,126,487 B2) Magnetic Field Architecture (MFA) technology. To demonstrate the MFA technology, Arx Pax created the [[hoverboard|Hendo Hoverboard]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://arxpax.com/newsroom/press-releases/|title=Press Releases - Arx Pax|website=Arx Pax|language=en-US|accessdate=2016-04-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Applications ==
The MFA technology has potential uses beyond levitating skateboards. Applications of MFA technology include structural isolation, recreation and entertainment, industrial automation and transportation, according to Arx Pax, Inc. Hovering robots cleaning and sterilizing key areas of a medical facility, industrial tools such as fork lifts incorporating MFA Technology for a safer and more efficient workplace, and even a magnetic [[tractor beam]] through a partnership with NASA have been envisioned.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.apexmagnets.com/news-how-tos/what-is-magnetic-field-architecture/|title=What Is Magnetic Field Architecture?|website=Apex Magnets|publisher=Apex Magnets|accessdate=2016-04-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.space.com/30446-nasa-hoverboard-technology-cubesats.html|title=NASA Wants to Use Hoverboard Tech to Control Tiny Satellites|website=Space.com|accessdate=2016-04-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, once you join MFA technology to the [http://lineshapespace.com/what-is-the-internet-of-things-design/ Internet of Things] (IoT), the possibilities may seem endless. There are wearables; Arx Pax envisions something called movables, making the environment the MFA technology is employed in a smarter landscape.

'''Man Luen Choon''' ({{zh|t=文聯莊}}) is a Chinese art supply store in [[Hong Kong]].

==History==
[[File:mlc front.jpg|thumb|200px|Man Luen Choon's store]]
[[File:Mlc kobe hk.jpg|thumb|200px|Mounting Calligraphy for Kobe Bryant]]

'''''Mattress Performance (Carry That Weight)''''' (2014–2015) was a work of [[endurance art|endurance performance art]] by [[Emma Sulkowicz]], conducted as their senior thesis during the final year of a [[visual arts]] degree at [[Columbia University]] in New York City.&lt;ref name=endurance&gt;For "endurance performance art", Emma Sulkowicz (September 2, 2014). [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l9hHZbuYVnU "Emma Sulkowicz: "Carry That Weight"], ''Columbia Daily Spectator'', at 2:22 min.&lt;/ref&gt;

Begun in September 2014, the piece involved Sulkowicz carrying a {{convert|50|lb|adj=on}} mattress, of the kind that Columbia uses in its [[dorm]]s, around campus. Sulkowicz, who is [[non-binary]] and uses they/them pronouns,&lt;ref&gt;https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2018/02/12/is-there-a-smarter-way-to-think-about-sexual-assault-on-campus)&lt;/ref&gt; said the piece would end when a student [[Columbia University rape controversy|Sulkowicz alleged raped them]] in Sulkowicz's dorm room in 2012 was expelled or otherwise left the university.&lt;ref name=ignore&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/morning-mix/wp/2014/10/29/its-hard-to-ignore-a-woman-toting-a-mattress-everywhere-she-goes-which-is-why-emma-sulkowicz-is-still-doing-it/ | title=It's hard to ignore a woman toting a mattress everywhere she goes, which is why Emma Sulkowicz is still doing it | work=The Washington Post | date=October 29, 2014| author=Soraya Nadia McDonald}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sulkowicz carried the mattress until the end of the spring semester as well as to the graduation ceremony in May 2015.&lt;ref name="Taylor20May2015" /&gt;

Paul Nungesser, the student who Sulkowicz accused, was found not responsible in 2013 by a university inquiry into the allegations. He called Sulkowicz's accusation "untrue and unfounded" and ''Mattress Performance'' an act of bullying.&lt;ref name=VanSyckle20January2015 /&gt; Sulkowicz filed a police complaint in May 2014; the district attorney's office did not pursue criminal charges, citing a lack of [[reasonable suspicion]]. In April 2015 Nungesser filed a lawsuit against the university, its trustees, university president [[Lee Bollinger]], and art professor [[Jon Kessler]], Sulkowicz's thesis supervisor, alleging that the school exposed him to gender-based harassment by allowing ''Mattress Performance'' to take place on campus for [[course credit]].&lt;ref name=lawsuit /&gt;&lt;ref name="kutner_dec_2015"&gt;Max Kutner (December 10, 2015), [http://www.newsweek.com/2015/12/18/other-side-sexual-assault-crisis-403285.html "The Other Side of the College Sexual Assault Crisis"], ''Newsweek''. Retrieved February 1, 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; The suit was dismissed in March 2016. Nungesser filed an amended complaint on April 25, 2016,&lt;ref name="newsweek_new_complaint"/&gt; which resulted in the university settling for undisclosed terms, and expressing regret about his "difficult" time and promising to reform its policies so "accuser and accused, including those like [the student] who are found not responsible" are "treated with respect" in the future.&lt;ref name="lawsuit-settled" /&gt;

The piece stirred controversy with praise from art critics and criticism from some commentators. Art critic [[Jerry Saltz]] called ''Mattress Performance'' "pure radical vulnerability" and one of the best art shows of 2014.&lt;ref name=Saltz /&gt; Journalist [[Emily Bazelon]] described the work and events surrounding it as "an increasingly bitter fight over truth and narrative", a triumph for the [[rape survivor|survivor]] movement and a nightmare for the student Sulkowicz accused.&lt;ref name=Bazelon29May2015 /&gt; Caught between defending and enabling Sulkowicz's [[Freedom of speech|freedom of expression]] and Nungesser's right to [[Due Process Clause|due process]] and the university's written policies regarding confidentiality, the university was criticized by both parties and their parents for its handling of the issue.

== Background ==
{{Main|Columbia University rape controversy}}
[[File:Emma Sulkowicz, 14 December 2014.jpg|thumb|Sulkowicz, December 2014]]
Emma Sulkowicz attended [[Dalton School]] on the [[Upper East Side]], and in 2011 began their [[visual arts]] degree at Columbia University.&lt;ref name=Grigoriadis21September2014 /&gt;
Sulkowicz alleges that they were slapped, choked, and anally raped by Nungesser in Sulkowicz's dorm room, on the first day of their second year in August 2012, during what began as a consensual sexual encounter.&lt;ref name=Grigoriadis21September2014 /&gt; Nungesser denies the allegation, insisting that the encounter was entirely consensual. In April 2013, 8 months after the encounter, Sulkowicz filed a complaint with the university.&lt;ref name=Grigoriadis21September2014 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Kaminer22Dec2014&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.nytimes.com/2014/12/22/nyregion/accusers-and-the-accused-crossing-paths-at-columbia.html | title=Accusers and the Accused, Crossing Paths at Columbia University | work=The New York Times | date=December 22, 2014 | author=Ariel Kaminer}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sulkowicz says they filed their complaint after they encountered two female students who said they had also been victimized by Nungesser.&lt;ref name=ignore /&gt; One was a former girlfriend who said she was emotionally abused during their long-term relationship, and stated that she later recognized their sexual relations as having been non-consensual. The other said that on one occasion Nungesser had moved toward her aggressively, grabbed her arms, and attempted to kiss her.&lt;ref name="Bwog"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://bwog.com/2014/01/23/accessible-prompt-and-equitable-an-examination-of-sexual-assault-at-columbia/ | title="Accessible, Prompt, and Equitable"?

The case attracted wider attention when the three female students who filed complaints gave interviews to the ''New York Post'', which broke the story on December 11, 2013, without naming those involved.&lt;ref&gt;For interview with Sulkowicz that mentions the ''New York Post'', Christoph Cadenbach (May 2015), [http://sz-magazin.sueddeutsche.de/texte/anzeigen/42729/2/1 "Nachtschatten"], ''Suddeutche Zeitung Magazin'', p. 2; for the ''Post'' story, Tara Palmeri (December 11, 2013), [https://nypost.com/2013/12/11/co-eds-rip-columbia-over-athlete-rape-probes/ "Columbia drops ball on jock 'rapist' probe: students"], ''New York Post''.&lt;/ref&gt; In April 2014 Sulkowicz appeared with Senator [[Kirsten Gillibrand]] at a press conference about [[campus sexual assault]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://newyork.cbslocal.com/2014/04/07/sen-kirsten-gillibrand-seeks-funds-to-fight-college-campus-sex-assaults/ "Sen.

On April 24, 2014, 23 students filed a federal complaint against Columbia and [[Barnard College]], alleging violations of [[Title IX]] of the [[Education Amendments of 1972]], a law upholding gender equality in federally-funded institutions.&lt;ref name=Bogler24April2014&gt;Emma Bogler (April 24, 2014).

On May 14, 2014, Sulkowicz filed a complaint with the [[New York Police Department]].&lt;ref name=Bogler16May2014&gt;{{cite news |author=Emma Bogler|title=Frustrated by Columbia's inaction, student reports sexual assault to police|url=http://columbiaspectator.com/news/2014/05/16/frustrated-columbias-inaction-student-reports-sexual-assault-police|work=Columbia Daily Spectator|date=May 16, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The district attorney's office interviewed Sulkowicz and Nungesser in August, but did not pursue charges, citing lack of [[reasonable suspicion]].&lt;ref name=lawsuit /&gt;

== Creation and performance ==
[[File:Mattress Performance rules of engagement.jpg|thumb|300px|alt=photograph|''Mattress Performance'' rules of engagement, Columbia University, 2014]]
[[File:Mattress Performance (Carry That Weight), 10 September 2014.jpg|thumb|300px|alt=photograph|"Carry that Weight Together", Columbia University, September 10, 2014]]

Sulkowicz created ''Mattress Performance (Carry That Weight)'' in the summer of 2014 for their senior thesis while at [[Yale University]] Summer School of Art and Music. Their first effort was a [[Video art|video]] of themself moving a bed out of a room, accompanied by the [[Audio art|audio]] of them filing the police report, which they had recorded on their cellphone.&lt;ref name=Sulkowicz14Dec2014b&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMXp3RLOVNg Smith 2014], at c.&amp;nbsp;38:50 min.&lt;/ref&gt; The mattress later became the focus of the piece.&lt;ref name=Smith22September2014 /&gt; Sulkowicz's thesis was supervised by artist [[Jon Kessler]], a professor at Columbia. As the idea for ''Mattress Performance'' developed, Kessler and Sulkowicz discussed the nature of endurance art and the work of [[Tehching Hsieh]], [[Marina Abramović]], [[Ulay]] and [[Chris Burden]].&lt;ref name=Steinhauer17September2014&gt;Jillian Steinhauer (September 17, 2014). [http://hyperallergic.com/149368/two-weeks-into-performance-columbia-student-discusses-the-weight-of-her-mattress/ "Two Weeks Into Performance, Columbia Student Discusses the Weight of Her Mattress"], ''Hyperallergic''; [http://arts.columbia.edu/visual-arts/faculty/jon-kessler "Jon Kessler"], Columbia University School of the Arts.&lt;/ref&gt; Sulkowicz described the work as "an endurance performance art piece". They told the ''Columbia Daily Spectator'': "I do think that nowadays art pieces can include whatever the artist desires and in this performance art piece it utilizes the elements of protest ..."&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l9hHZbuYVnU Sulkowicz (September 2, 2014)], from c. 2:23 min.&lt;/ref&gt;

Purchased online from Tall Paul's Tall Mall, the 50-lb (23-kg), dark-blue, extra-long twin mattress is of the kind Columbia places in its dorms, similar to the one on which Sulkowicz said that they were raped.&lt;ref name=Grigoriadis21September2014&gt;Vanessa Grigoriadis (September 21, 2014). [http://nymag.com/thecut/2014/09/emma-sulkowicz-campus-sexual-assault-activism.html "Meet the College Women Who Are Starting a Revolution Against Campus Sexual Assault"], ''[[New York (magazine)|New York]]''.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Sulkowicz14Dec2014b /&gt; They spent the summer of 2014 creating the rules of engagement, which defined the parameters of the project. Written on the walls of their studio in the university's Watson Hall, these included that they had to carry the mattress when on university property; that it had to remain on campus when they were not there; and that they were not allowed to ask for help in carrying it, but if help was offered they could accept.&lt;ref name=Sulkowicz14Dec2014b /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;For Watson Hall, [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l9hHZbuYVnU Sulkowicz (September 2, 2014)], from c. 2:00 min.&lt;/ref&gt;

In early September 2014 Sulkowicz began carrying the mattress on campus.&lt;ref&gt;Noel Duan (September 9, 2014). [http://www.elle.com/culture/career-politics/a14546/columbia-university-sexual-assault-mattress-performance-emma-sulkowicz/ "Going From Class to Class With Emma Sulkowicz and Her Mattress"], ''Elle''.&lt;/ref&gt; A homeless man was one of the first to help. Sulkowicz told ''New York'' magazine: "He was the first person who helped without some sort of preconstructed belief for why they were going to help. He was like, 'Oh, look, a struggling girl—let me help her and be a nice human being.' That was probably the most honest interaction I had."&lt;ref name=Battaglia28May2015&gt;Andy Battaglia (May 28, 2015). [http://www.vulture.com/2015/05/does-sulkowiczs-mattress-belong-in-a-museum.html "Will Emma Sulkowicz's Protest Mattress Wind Up in a Museum?"], ''[[New York (magazine)|New York]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; They kept a diary throughout, amounting to 59,000 words at the end of the work, recording their experiences as well as the misunderstandings of commentators.&lt;ref name=Battaglia28May2015 /&gt;

Sulkowicz said the work would end when Nungesser was expelled from or otherwise left Columbia, and that they would take the mattress to their graduation ceremony if necessary.&lt;ref name=Grigoriadis21September2014 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Smith22September2014 /&gt; In the end Sulkowicz carried it to the graduation ceremony on May 19, 2015,&lt;ref name="kutner_dec_2015" /&gt; despite a request from the school that students should not bring "large objects which could interfere with the proceedings".&lt;ref name=Taylor20May2015&gt;Kate Taylor (May 20, 2015). [https://www.nytimes.com/2015/05/20/nyregion/mattress-protest-at-columbia-university-continues-into-graduation-event.html "Mattress Protest at Columbia University Continues Into Graduation Event"], ''The New York Times''.&lt;/ref&gt; Several women helped carry the mattress on stage. As they approached, university president [[Lee Bollinger]], who had been shaking other graduates' hands, turned away as if to pick something up, and did not shake their hands; the university said this happened because the mattress was in the way.&lt;ref name=Bazelon29May2015 /&gt; The next day posters appeared in [[Morningside Heights]] near the university calling Sulkowicz a "pretty little liar".&lt;ref name=Roy20May2015&gt;Jessica Roy (May 20, 2015); [http://nymag.com/thecut/2015/05/posters-around-columbia-emma-sulkowicz-lied.html "Posters Around Columbia Campus Call Emma Sulkowicz a 'Pretty Little Liar'"], ''[[New York (magazine)|New York]]''.&lt;/ref&gt;

After graduation Sulkowicz said they had known the university would not expel Nungesser, and had expected to carry the mattress for nine months, the length of a pregnancy, which was an important part of the work: "To me, the piece has very much represented [the fact that] a guy did a horrible thing to me and I tried to make something beautiful out of it."&lt;ref name=Battaglia28May2015 /&gt;

== Reception ==

=== Reaction by the accused ===
Paul Nungesser said in a December 2014 interview with ''The New York Times'' that the mattress performance is not an act of artistic expression, but instead one orchestrated to bully him and force him to leave Columbia.&lt;ref&gt;Sarah Kaplan (February 4, 2015). [https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/morning-mix/wp/2015/02/04/in-columbia-university-rape-case-accuser-and-accused-are-now-fighting-it-out-in-public/ "In Columbia University rape case, accuser and accused are now fighting it out in public"], ''The Washington Post''.&lt;/ref&gt; He said that on the National Day of Action, protesters followed him around, carrying mattresses to one of his classes and taking his picture. He also said that he was not permitted to use written communications between himself and the alleged victim as evidence, and expressed disbelief that anyone could believe he was guilty even after his accusers failed to meet what he deemed the low burden of proof in the university hearing process.&lt;ref name=Bazelon29May2015&gt;Emily Bazelon (May 29, 2015). [https://www.nytimes.com/2015/05/29/magazine/have-we-learned-anything-from-the-columbia-rape-case.html "Have We Learned Anything From the Columbia Rape Case?"], ''The New York Times Magazine''.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=NYT&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.nytimes.com/2014/12/22/nyregion/accusers-and-the-accused-crossing-paths-at-columbia.html | title=Accusers and the Accused, Crossing Paths at Columbia University | work=The New York Times | date=December 22, 2014 | author=Kaminer, Ariel}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also stated that since Sulkowicz's protest serves as their senior thesis, it is being supervised and implicitly endorsed by a Columbia faculty member.&lt;ref name=NYT /&gt;
 
Nungesser's parents criticized the university, including its decision to let Sulkowicz take the mattress to the graduation ceremony: "This has been a deeply humiliating experience.&amp;nbsp;... A university that bows to a public witch-hunt no longer deserves to be called a place of enlightenment, of intellectual and academic freedom."&lt;ref name=VanSyckle20May2015&gt;Katie Van Syckle (May 20, 2015).

[http://www.zeit.de/studium/uni-leben/2015-05/columbia-university-sexual-assault-trial "What Happened on the Mattress?"], ''Zeit''.&lt;/ref&gt; Asked by German ''[[Süddeutsche Zeitung]] Magazin'' about her feelings on the treatment of her son at Columbia, the Nungesser's mother said, "This is a feeling of lawlessness." His father said that he sometimes fears his son will leave the school as a "cynic" and a "suspicious man".&lt;ref&gt;Christoph Cadenbach: [http://sz-magazin.sueddeutsche.de/texte/anzeigen/42729/3/1 "Nachtschatten"], ''Süddeutsche Zeitung Magazin'', Heft 5/2015&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 2015 Nungesser filed a [[Title IX]] lawsuit against Columbia University, its trustees, university president Lee Bollinger, and Sulkowicz's senior-thesis supervisor, Jon Kessler, alleging they exposed him to gender-based harassment and a hostile educational environment in allowing the project to go forward.

==== Praise ====
Numerous art critics responded positively to ''Mattress Performance''. [[Artnet]] cited it as "almost certainly&amp;nbsp;... one of the most important artworks of the year", comparing it to [[Ana Mendieta]]'s ''[[Untitled (Rape Scene)]]'' (1973) and [[Suzanne Lacy]] and [[Leslie Labowitz-Starus]]'s ''[[Three Weeks in May]]'' (1977).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://news.artnet.com/art-world/columbia-students-striking-mattress-performance-92346 | title=Columbia Student's Striking Mattress Performance | work=Artnet | date=September 4, 2014 | author=Ben Davis}}&lt;/ref&gt; Performance artist [[Marina Abramović]] praised it.&lt;ref&gt;Rachel Corbett (October 24, 2014).

==== Criticism ====
A number of commentators questioned Sulkowicz's account of the assault and argued that the performance was unfair to Nungesser.

Social critic [[Camille Paglia]] described ''Mattress Performance'' as "a parody of the worst aspects of that kind of grievance-oriented feminism", adding that a feminist work "should empower women, not cripple them".&lt;ref name=Paglia&gt;{{cite news |last1=Daley|first1=David|title=Camille Paglia: How Bill Clinton is like Bill Cosby|url=http://www.salon.com/2015/07/28/camille_paglia_how_bill_clinton_is_like_bill_cosby/ |publisher=Salon |date=July 28, 2015 |accessdate=August 10, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Quackenbush|first1=Casey|title=Camille Paglia: Columbia Anti-Rape Mattress Project Is Not Feminism|url=http://observer.com/2015/07/camille-paglia-columbia-anti-rape-mattress-project-is-backwards-feminism/ |newspaper=[[New York Observer]] |date=July 30, 2015 |accessdate=August 16, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In an editorial in the ''[[New York Post]]''', [[Naomi Schaefer Riley]] criticized Sulkowicz's work as "shaming without proof" and accused Sulkowicz and their supporters of "saving themselves from having to answer any questions and destroying men's lives with lies and innuendo".&lt;ref name="Naomi Schaefer Riley"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://nypost.com/2015/02/08/columbia-mattress-rape-case-is-not-justice-its-shaming-without-proof/|title=Columbia mattress rape case is not justice—it's shaming without proof |last1=Riley |first1=Naomi Schaefer |date=February 8, 2015 |newspaper=[[New York Post]] |accessdate=November 16, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In his article "If anything's art, art's nothing", ''[[National Post]]'' columnist [[Robert Fulford (journalist)|Robert Fulford]] compared Sulkowicz's work to that of [[Megumi Igarashi]] and concluded, "if everything is art, then art can be used for anything. And in the process meaning and value dissolve and art becomes hopelessly debased."&lt;ref&gt;National Post (May 1, 2015), [http://news.nationalpost.com/full-comment/robert-fulford-if-anythings-art-arts-nothing "Robert Fulford: If anything’s art, art's nothing"].&lt;/ref&gt;

In an editorial for the Federalist, columnist [[Mona Charen]] stated that she believed Sulkowicz was likely "shading the truth"  and argued that, while campus rape was a real problem, advocates did not pay enough attention to the possibility of false allegations. &lt;ref name=Bazelon29May2015 /&gt;&lt;ref name="thef_What"&gt;{{Cite web | title = What The Left And Right Don't Get About Campus Rape |author = Mona Charen |publisher = The Federalist |date = August 31, 2015 |url = http://thefederalist.com/2015/08/31/what-the-left-and-right-dont-get-about-campus-rape/ |accessdate = May 4, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Mosan art''' is a regional style of art from the valley of the [[Meuse river|Meuse]] in present-day [[Belgium]], the [[Netherlands]], and [[Germany]]. Although in a broader sense the term applies to art from this region from all periods, it generally refers to [[Romanesque art]], with Mosan [[Romanesque architecture]], [[stone carving]], [[Metalsmith|metalwork]], [[Vitreous enamel|enamelling]] and [[Illuminated manuscript|manuscript illumination]] reaching a high level of development during the 11th, 12th and 13th centuries.

==Development of Mosan art and geographical spread==
The Meuse valley lay in the heart of the [[Carolingian Empire]] and therefore the style draws largely from the heritage of the [[Carolingian art]] tradition. Thus, Mosan art contains strong classical elements, which separates it from the international Romanesque style seen elsewhere during the period, for example in France,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.musee-moyenage.fr/ang/pages/page_id18376_u1l2.htm www.musee-moyenage.fr] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20051017230516/http://www.musee-moyenage.fr/ang/pages/page_id18376_u1l2.htm |date=2005-10-17 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Germany&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.musee-moyenage.fr/ang/pages/page_id18362_u1l2.htm www.musee-moyenage.fr] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20051017081429/http://www.musee-moyenage.fr/ang/pages/page_id18362_u1l2.htm |date=2005-10-17 }}&lt;/ref&gt; England and Italy. However, it shares with mainstream Romanesque art elements such as the treatment of space. Although the [[iconography]] of 11th- and 12th-century Meuse valley art largely draws on [[Bible|Biblical]] inspiration, some of the elaborately carved capitals in the two main churches in [[Maastricht]] depict scenes from many aspects of daily life, as well as images from an intriguing world of fantasy.

The Mosan region was formed largely by the boundary of the [[Bishopric of Liège]], which had strong political links to the emperors of the [[Holy Roman Empire]], as well as to the bishops of [[Electorate of Cologne|Cologne]]. The region's main artistic centres were the cities of [[Liège]], [[Huy]], [[Dinant]], [[Namur (city)|Namur]], [[Tongeren]], [[Maastricht]], [[Roermond]] and [[Aachen]], as well as a number of important monasteries: [[Sint-Truiden]], [[Church of Saint Anne, Aldeneik|Aldeneik]], [[Herkenrode Abbey|Herkenrode]], [[Averbode Abbey|Averbode]], [[Munsterbilzen Abbey|Munsterbilzen]], [[Susteren Abbey|Susteren]], [[Sint Odiliënberg]], [[Rolduc]], [[Burtscheid Abbey|Burtscheid]], [[Kornelimünster Abbey|Kornelimünster]], [[Stavelot]], [[Collegiate Church of Saint Gertrude|Nivelles]], [[Aulne Abbey|Aulne]], [[Floreffe Abbey|Floreffe]], [[Flône Abbey|Flône]], [[Celles, Houyet|Celles]], [[Gembloux Abbey|Gembloux]] and [[Lobbes Abbey|Lobbes]]. Mosan art at its peak had a strong influence on bordering regions, notably on [[Rhineland]] art ([[Cologne]], [[Bonn]]).

==Highlights of Mosan art==
Mosan Romanesque art has been described by art historians as the first golden age of Netherlandish art (before [[early Netherlandish painting]] and [[Dutch Golden Age painting]]). Usually the term Mosan art does not include [[Medieval literature]] although [[Heinrich von Veldeke]] may be considered the first poet writing in [[Middle Dutch]] (as well as [[Middle High German]]).

===Architecture===
Mosan architecture can be seen as a distinctive branch in [[Romanesque architecture]], a regional style that produced imposing churches in Aachen, Liège and Maastricht, as well as monasteries in rural areas. The fully developed Mosan style of the 12th century is a comprise between the older Meuse valley traditions and foreign influences, mainly coming from the [[Rhineland]] and [[Italy]]. An outstanding factor in Mosan architecture is the closed west front ([[westwerk]]). Unfortunately, some of the largest churches, notably [[St. Lambert's Cathedral, Liège|Liège cathedral]], and the Stavelot and Sint-Truiden abbeys, were destroyed.

===Stone carving===
Mosan stone carving reached a peak in the 12th century in Maastricht, Liège and Nivelles. Maastricht 'metsen' (stone carvers) worked on [[Capital (architecture)|capitals]] and [[relief]]s as far afield as [[Utrecht (city)|Utrecht]], [[Bonn]] and [[Eisenach]].

===Metalwork===
[[Metalsmith|Metalwork]] has been considered the high art of the 12th and early 13th-century Meuse region, culminating in the work of [[Nicholas of Verdun]], which is of exceptionally high quality. The [[Shrine of the Three Kings at Cologne Cathedral]], the Anno Shrine in [[Siegburg]] and the Shrine of Our Lady in [[Tournai]] are among his best work. Other important metalworkers were [[Renier de Huy]] and [[Hugo d'Oignies]].

===Painting, illumination and other works of art===
Very little has come to us from what must have been an impressive body of Mosan [[mural]]s. [[Wolfram von Eschenbach]], in his [[Parzival]] expressed his high regard for Maastricht (and Cologne) painters ([https://books.google.com/books?id=eII6AAAAcAAJ&amp;pg=PA83 Parzival, 158, 13-16]). [[Illuminated manuscript|Book illumination]], like the rest of the arts, was at its zenith in the second half of the 12th century. The principal centres were the abbey of Saint Laurent in Liège and the abbeys of Stavelot and Lobbes. Another highly developed art was [[vitreous enamel]]ing.

[[File:Reichstag flag original.jpg|thumb|300px|''Raising a Flag over the Reichstag'', by [[Yevgeny Khaldei]]]]
'''''Raising a Flag over the Reichstag''''' is a historic [[World War II]] photograph, taken during the [[Battle of Berlin]] on 2 May 1945. It is assumed to show [[Meliton Kantaria]]&lt;ref name="altKantaria" group="A"/&gt; and [[Mikhail Yegorov]]&lt;ref name="altYegorov" group="A"/&gt; raising the [[flag of the Soviet Union]] atop the [[Reichstag building]]. The photograph was reprinted in thousands of publications and came to be regarded around the world as one of the most significant and recognizable images of World War II. Owing to the secrecy of Soviet media, the identities of the men in the picture were often disputed, as was that of the photographer, [[Yevgeny Khaldei]], who was identified only after the [[dissolution of the Soviet Union]]. It became a symbol of the Soviet victory over [[Nazi Germany]].

==Background==
[[File:Soviet flag on the Reichstag roof Khaldei.jpg|thumb|''Raising a flag over the Reichstag'', by [[Yevgeny Khaldei]] but with smoke added{{sfn|Baumann|2010|p=}}]]
{{Main|Battle of Berlin}}
The Battle of Berlin was the final major [[offensive (military)|offensive]] of the [[European theatre of World War II]] and was designated the Berlin Strategic Offensive Operation by the [[Soviet Union]].&lt;ref name="LastOffensive" group="A"/&gt; Starting on 16 April 1945, the Red Army breached the [[Nazi Germany|German]] front as a result of the [[Vistula–Oder Offensive]] and rapidly advanced westward through Germany, as fast as 30–40 kilometres a day. The [[Battle in Berlin|battle for Berlin]] lasted from late 20 April 1945 until 2 May and was one of the [[List of battles by casualties#Sieges and urban combat|bloodiest in history]].

Erected in 1894, the Reichstag's architecture was magnificent for its time. The building contributed much to [[German history]] and was considered by the [[Red Army]] to be the symbol of their fascist enemy. However, to the Nazis, the Reichstag was a symbol of democracy and representative government; consequently they had left it closed and damaged since the infamous [[Reichstag fire]] in 1933. Instead of being a center of fascist power, the Reichstag had been closed down for 12 years, essentially the entirety of the Nazi reign, with subsequent meetings of the Reichstag convening at the nearby [[Kroll Opera House]] instead. After fierce combat within its walls, the Soviets finally captured the Reichstag on 2 May 1945.

==Taking the photograph==
The Reichstag was seen as symbolic of, and at the heart of, Nazi Germany. It was arguably the most symbolic target in Berlin. The events surrounding the flag-raising are murky due to the confusion of the fight at the building. On 30 April there was great pressure from Stalin to take the building, in time for the [[International Workers' Day]], 1 May.{{sfn|Dallas|2006|p=3}}{{Dubious |reason=The book does not mention anything similar to "Stalin's pressure"|date=May 2017}} Initially, two planes dropped several large red banners on the roof that appeared to have caught on the bombed-out dome. Additionally, a number of reports had reached headquarters that two parties, M. M. Bondar from the 380th Rifle Regiment and Captain V. N. Makov of the 756th might have been able to hoist a flag during the day of 30 April.{{sfn|Tissier|1999|p=168}} These reports were received by [[Georgy Zhukov|Marshal G. K. Zhukov]], who issued an announcement stating that his troops had captured the Reichstag and hoisted a flag. However, when correspondents arrived, they found no Soviets in the building, but rather they were pinned down outside by German fire. After fierce fighting both outside and inside the building, a flag was raised at 22:40 on 30 April 1945, when 23-year-old [[Rakhimzhan Qoshqarbaev]] climbed the building and inserted a flag into the crown of the mounted female statue of "Germania", symbolizing Germany. As this happened at night, it was too dark to take a photograph.{{sfn|Lucas|2010|p=}} The next day the flag was taken down by the Germans.{{sfn|Lucas|2010|p=}} The Red Army finally gained control of the entire building on 2 May.{{sfn|Beevor|2003|pp=390–397}}

On 2 May 1945, Khaldei scaled the now pacified Reichstag to take his picture. He was carrying with him a large flag, sewn from three tablecloths for this very purpose, by his uncle.&lt;ref name="Griffin 1999, 144"&gt;Griffin, Michael (199). "The Great War Photographs: Constructing Myths of History and Photojournalism". In Bonnie Brennen &amp; Hanno Hardt eds., ''Picturing the Past: Media, History &amp; Photography''. (pp. 122–157). Urbana: University of Illinois Press. p. 144. {{ISBN|0-252-06769-X}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The official story would later be that two hand-picked soldiers, [[Meliton Kantaria]]&lt;ref name="altKantaria" group="A"/&gt; (Georgian) and [[Mikhail Yegorov]]&lt;ref name="altYegorov" group="A"/&gt; (Russian), raised the Soviet flag over the Reichstag,{{sfn|Dallas|2006|p=3}}{{sfn|Tissier|1999|p=124}}{{sfn|Antill|Dennis|2005|p=76}}{{sfn|Adams|2008|p=48}} and the photograph would often be used as depicting the event. Some authors state that for political reasons the subjects of the photograph were changed and the actual man to hoist the flag was [[Alexei Kovalyov]],&lt;ref name="altKovalyov" group="A"/&gt;{{sfn|Broekmeyer|2004|p=130}}{{sfn|Walkowitz|Knauer|2004|p=83}} (also known as Alyosha Kovalyov) a Ukrainian, who was told by the NKVD to keep quiet about it.{{sfn|Broekmeyer|2004|p=130}}

However, according to Khaldei himself, when he arrived at the Reichstag, he simply asked the soldiers who happened to be passing by to help with the staging of the photoshoot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.spiegel.de/kultur/gesellschaft/0,1518,551663,00.html|title=Legendäre Foto-Manipulation Fahne gefälscht, Uhr versteckt, Wolken erfunden - SPIEGEL ONLINE|publisher=[[Der Spiegel|Spiegel]]|date=2008-05-06|accessdate=2012-05-20|language=German}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="time20080523"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.time.com/time/world/article/0,8599,1809018,00.html|title=Remembering a Red Flag Day|publisher=[[Time (magazine)|Time]]|date=2008-05-23|accessdate=2012-05-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; there were only four of them, including Khaldei, on the roof:&lt;ref name="epochtimes"/&gt; the one who was attaching the flag was 18-year-old Private [[Alexei Kovalyov]] from [[Kiev]], the two others were [[Abdulkhakim Ismailov]] from [[Dagestan]] and [[Leonid Gorychev]] (also mentioned as Aleksei Goryachev) from [[Minsk]].&lt;ref name="time20080523"/&gt;&lt;ref name="epochtimes"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.epochtimes.ru/content/view/5101/34/|script-title=holdithereB0Знамя Победы над Рейхстагом".

==Aftermath==
The photo was published 13 May 1945 in the ''[[Ogonyok]]'' magazine.{{sfn|Sontheimer|2008|p=}} While many photographers took pictures of flags on the roof, it was Khaldei's image that stuck.{{sfn|Sontheimer|2008|p=}}

===Censorship===
{{Main|Censorship of images in the Soviet Union}}

After taking the symbolic photo, Khaldei quickly returned to Moscow. He further edited the image at the request of the editor-in-chief of the ''[[Ogonyok]]'', who noticed that [[Senior Sergeant]] [[Abdulkhakim Ismailov]], who is supporting the flag-bearer, was wearing two watches, which could imply he had looted one of them, an action punishable by execution.{{sfn|Sontheimer|2008|p=}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-564643/How-iconic-photo-Russians-raising-flag-burning-Berlin-airbrushed-save-soldier-Stalins-rage.html#ixzz5A8LETCZt|title=How iconic photo of Russians raising flag over burning Berlin was airbrushed to save soldier from Stalin's rage|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Using a needle, Khaldei removed the watch from the right wrist.{{sfn|Baumann|2010|p=}}{{sfn|Sontheimer|2008|p=}} He also added to the smoke in the background, copying it from another picture to make the scene more dramatic.{{sfn|Baumann|2010|p=}}

'''Robert Wilson''' (born October 4, 1941) is an American [[experimental theater]] [[stage director]] and [[playwright]] who has been described by the media as "[America]'s – or even the world's – foremost avant-garde 'theater artist{{'"}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1992/11/15/magazine/staging-painterly-visions.html|title=Staging Painterly Visions|author=[[John Rockwell]]|work=[[The New York Times]]|date=1992-11-15|page=23 (sect. 6)}}&lt;/ref&gt; Over the course of his wide-ranging career, he has also worked as a [[choreographer]], [[performer]], [[Painting|painter]], [[sculptor]], [[video artist]], and [[sound]] and [[lighting designer]]. 

He is best known for his collaborations with [[Philip Glass]] on ''[[Einstein on the Beach]]'', and with numerous other artists, including [[Heiner Müller]], [[William S. Burroughs]], [[Allen Ginsberg]], [[Lou Reed]], [[Tom Waits]], [[David Byrne]], [[Laurie Anderson]], [[Gavin Bryars]], [[Rufus Wainwright]], [[Marina Abramović]], [[Willem Dafoe]], [[Mikhail Baryshnikov]], [[Darryl Pinckney]], [[Richard Gallo (performance artist)|Richard Gallo]], and [[Lady Gaga]]. In 1991 Wilson established [[The Watermill Center]], "a laboratory for performance" on the East End of [[Long Island]], New York. He has received more commissions for new works in Europe than in the United States since the late 20th century, regularly working with opera and theatre companies, as well as cultural festivals.

==Early life and education==
Wilson was born in [[Waco, Texas]], the son of Loree Velma (née Hamilton) and D.M. Wilson, a lawyer.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.filmreference.com/film/30/Robert-Wilson.html "Robert Wilson"], ''Film Reference''&lt;/ref&gt; After attending local schools, he studied business administration at the [[University of Texas]] from 1959 to 1962. 

He moved to [[Brooklyn]], New York in 1963 in order to change fields. He received a [[Bachelor of Fine Arts|BFA]] in architecture from the [[Pratt Institute]] in 1966. During this period, he also attended lectures by [[Sibyl Moholy-Nagy]] (widow of [[László Moholy-Nagy]]), and studied painting with artist [[George McNeil (artist)|George McNeil]]. Later he went to Arizona to study architecture with [[Paolo Soleri]] at his desert complex.&lt;ref&gt;Rima Suqi (September 21, 2011), [https://www.nytimes.com/2011/09/22/garden/robert-wilson-on-his-passion-for-chairs.html "Robert Wilson, Director, on His Passion for Chairs"], ''[[The New York Times]]''.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==

=== Theater ===
After moving to New York, Wilson found himself drawn to the work of pioneering choreographers [[George Balanchine]], [[Merce Cunningham]], and [[Martha Graham]], among others.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.americancenterfrance.org/front/index.php?&amp;lvlid=66&amp;dsgtypid=10&amp;a=1&amp;title=The%C3%A2tre&amp;lang=en Robert Wilson], American Center France.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1968, he founded an experimental performance company, the Byrd Hoffman School of Byrds (named for a teacher who helped him overcome a severe stutter while a teenager). With this company, he directed his first major works, beginning with 1969's ''The King of Spain'' and ''The Life and Times of Sigmund Freud''. He began to work in opera in the early 1970s, creating ''[[Einstein on the Beach]]'' with composer [[Philip Glass]]. This work brought the two artists worldwide renown. Following ''Einstein'', Wilson worked increasingly with major European theaters and opera houses.&lt;ref name=paula/&gt; For the New York debut of his first opera, the [[Metropolitan Opera]] allowed Wilson to rent the house on a Sunday, when they did not have a production, but would not produce the work. The house sold out in two days.&lt;ref name=rachel&gt;Rachel Donadio (January 3, 2014), [https://www.nytimes.com/2014/01/04/arts/international/history-time-and-space-in-opera.html "Paris Embraces ''Einstein'' Again"], ''[[The New York Times]]''.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1972, Wilson's ''Deafman Glance'', a long, silent play, was premiered at the Nancy Festival in [[Nancy, France|France]]. It later opened in Paris, championed by the designer [[Pierre Cardin]].&lt;ref name="rachel"/&gt; The Surrealist poet [[Louis Aragon]] loved it and published a letter to the Surrealist poet [[André Breton]] (who had died in 1966),&lt;ref name="rachel"/&gt; in which he praised Wilson as: "What we, from whom Surrealism was born, dreamed would come after us and go beyond us".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Design Museum |title=Robert Wilson: Theatre Director + Designer |url=http://designmuseum.org/design/robert-wilson | accessdate=2010-03-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1983/84, Wilson planned a performance for the [[1984 Summer Olympics]], ''[[the CIVIL warS|the CIVIL warS: A Tree Is Best Measured When It Is Down]]''; the complete work was to have been 12 hours long, in 6 parts. The production was only partially completed; the full event was cancelled by the Olympic Arts Festival, due to insufficient funds.&lt;ref name=Rockwell1990&gt;[[John Rockwell]] (June 20, 1990), [https://www.nytimes.com/1990/06/20/theater/critic-s-notebook-robert-wilson-wins-a-faithful-following-but-it-s-in-europe.html "Critic's Notebook; Robert Wilson Wins A Faithful Following, But It's in Europe"], ''[[The New York Times]]''&lt;/ref&gt; In 1986, the [[Pulitzer Prize]] jury unanimously selected ''the CIVIL warS'' for the drama prize, but the supervisory board rejected the choice and gave no drama award that year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title= At Home With: Robert Wilson; The Clark Kent Of Modern Theater |author=Mel Gussow|work=[[The New York Times]]|date=Jan 6, 1994|page=C1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1990 alone, Wilson created four new productions in four different West German cities: Shakespeare's ''King Lear'' in Frankfurt, Chekhov's ''Swan Song'' in Munich, an adaptation of Virginia Woolf's ''Orlando'' in West Berlin, and ''The Black Rider,'' a collaboration by Wilson, [[Tom Waits]] and [[William S. Burroughs]], in Hamburg.&lt;ref name=Rockwell1990 /&gt;

Wilson is known for pushing the boundaries of theatre. His works are noted for their austere style, very slow movement, and often extreme scale in space or in time. ''The Life and Times of Joseph Stalin'' was a 12-hour performance, while ''KA MOUNTain and GUARDenia Terrace'' was staged on a mountaintop in [[Iran]] and lasted seven days.

In 2010 Wilson was working on a new stage musical with composer (and long-time collaborator) [[Tom Waits]] and the Irish playwright, [[Martin McDonagh]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.antilabelblog.com/?p=2257 | title=New Musical From Tom Waits On The Horizon | publisher=Anti Records | date=2010-02-02 | accessdate=2010-02-03 }}&lt;/ref&gt; His theatrical production of ''Lecture on Nothing'', which was commissioned for a celebration of the [[John Cage]] centenary at the 2012 [[Ruhrtriennale]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ruhrtriennale.de/en/programm/kuenstler/bob-wilson/ Robert Wilson] [[Ruhrtriennale]].&lt;/ref&gt; had its U.S. premiere in [[Royce Hall]], UCLA, by the Center for the Art of Performance.&lt;ref&gt;Mark Swed (October 16, 2013), [http://articles.latimes.com/2013/oct/16/entertainment/la-et-cm-john-cage-lecture-nothing-review-20131017 "Review: Robert Wilson finds the poetry in 'Lecture on Nothing{{'"}}], ''[[Los Angeles Times]]''.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2013 Wilson, in collaboration with [[Mikhail Baryshnikov]] and co-starring [[Willem Dafoe]], developed ''[[The Old Woman (play)|The Old Woman]]'', an adaptation of the work by the Russian author [[Daniil Kharms]]. The play premiered at MIF13, Manchester International Festival.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.mif.co.uk/event/the-old-woman|title=''The Old Woman'' Robert Wilson, Mikhail Baryshnikov, Willem Dafoe|date = 2013|accessdate = 2014-11-23|website = Manchester International Festival|publisher = Manchester International Festival|last = Jansch|first = Lucie}}&lt;/ref&gt; Wilson wrote that he and [[Mikhail Baryshnikov|Baryshnikov]] had discussed creating a play together for years, perhaps based on a Russian text.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://calperformances.org/learn/program_notes/2014/pn_oldwoman.pdf|title = Cal Performances University of California, Berkeley Playbill|date = 2014|accessdate = 2014-11-23|website = Calperformances|publisher = UC Berkeley|last = Wilson|first = Robert}}&lt;/ref&gt; The final production included dance, light, singing and bilingual monologue.

Since 1999, Wilson has premiered nine theatrical works in Berlin. By contrast, as of 2013, his last commission in the United States was 21 years ago.&lt;ref&gt;Patrick Barkham (August 22, 2012), [https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2012/aug/22/robert-wilson-walking-angels-norfolk "Robert Wilson takes a walk with angels in Norfolk"], ''[[The Guardian]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; 

He continues to direct revivals of his most celebrated productions, including ''The Black Rider'' in London, San Francisco, Sydney, Australia, and Los Angeles; ''The Temptation of St. Anthony'' in New York and Barcelona; ''Erwartung'' in Berlin; ''Madama Butterfly'' at the [[Bolshoi Opera]] in Moscow; and Wagner's ''Der Ring des Nibelungen'' at [[Théâtre du Châtelet]] in Paris.&lt;ref name=paula&gt;[http://www.paulacoopergallery.com/exhibitions/493 "Robert Wilson, Deafman Glance": Video Installation, September 24 – November 13, 2010] [[Paula Cooper Gallery]], New York.&lt;/ref&gt; He also directs all Monteverdi operas for the opera houses of [[La Scala]] in Milan and the [[Palais Garnier]] in Paris.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mif.co.uk/artist/robert-wilson MIF13: Robert Wilson] Manchester International Festival.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Visual art and design ===
In addition to his work for the stage, Wilson creates sculpture, drawings, and furniture designs. He won the Golden Lion at the 1993 [[Venice Biennale]] for a sculptural installation. Exhibited in December 1976 at the [[Paula Cooper Gallery]], Wilson's storyboards were described by one critic as "serial art, equivalent to the slow-motion tempo of [Wilson's] theatrical style. In drawing after drawing after drawing, a detail is proposed, analyzed, refined, redefined, moved through various positions."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.paulacoopergallery.com/exhibitions/525 Einstein on the Beach: Robert Wilson, Philip Glass, Lucinda Childs, Christopher Knowles, Andrew de Groat, September 12 – October 20, 2012] [[Paula Cooper Gallery]], New York.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2004, [[Ali Hossaini]] offered Wilson a residency at the television channel [[LAB HD]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Ali Hossaini |title=Merging Art and Television |url=http://www.highdef.com/magazine/archive/HighDef_2007_2MarApr.pdf |format=PDF|page= 25 |accessdate=2007-04-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since then Wilson, with producer Esther Gordon (and among others [[Brad Pitt]], [[Mikhail Baryshnikov]], [[Robert Downey, Jr.]], [[Winona Ryder]], [[Juliette Binoche]], [[Isabelle Huppert]], [[Dita von Teese]], and [[Peter Sarsgaard]]) and later with Matthew Shattuck, has produced dozens of high-definition videos known as the [[Voom Portraits]]. Collaborators on this well-received project included the composer [[Michael Galasso]], the late artist and designer Eugene Tsai, fashion designer Kevin Santos, and lighting designer Urs Schönebaum. In addition to celebrity subjects, sitters have included royalty, animals, Nobel Prize winners and hobos.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://www.vanityfair.com/news/2006/12/wilson200612|title= The Subject as Star|author=Bob Colacello |journal= Vanity Fair |publisher=Condé Nast |page= 318 |date=December 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

American pop singer [[Lady Gaga]] announced in 2013 that she would collaborate with Wilson as part of her ARTPOP project. He subsequently designed the set for her 2013 [[MTV Video Music Awards]] performance.&lt;ref name=gaga&gt;Amy Serafin (December 12, 2013), [http://www.wallpaper.com/art/robert-wilsons-macabre-video-portraits-of-lady-gaga/7011#XhR3uydTERiTAj84.99 "Robert Wilson's macabre video portraits of Lady Gaga"] (12 Dec 2013) ''[[Wallpaper (magazine)|Wallpaper]]''.&lt;/ref&gt;

Wilson also suggested that Gaga pose for his Voom Portraits.&lt;ref name=gaga/&gt; Knowing he had an upcoming residency as guest curator at the [[Louvre]], Wilson chose themes from the museum's collection, all dealing with death. They shot the videos in a London studio over three days, Gaga standing for 14 or 15 hours at a time.&lt;ref name=gaga/&gt; Called "Living Rooms," the resulting exhibition included two video works: one inspired by [[Jacques-Louis David]]'s ''[[The Death of Marat]]'', hung in the painting galleries, and another in which Lady Gaga brings to life a painting by [[Ingres]].&lt;ref name=rachel/&gt; In the Louvre's auditorium, Wilson hosted and took part in a series of performances, conversations, film screenings, and discussions.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.louvre.fr/en/louvre-invites-robert-wilson-living-rooms The Louvre invites Robert Wilson – Living Rooms, November 11, 2013 – February 17, 2014] [[Louvre]], Paris.&lt;/ref&gt; The centerpiece of the residency is a room filled with objects from the artist's personal collection in New York, including African masks, a Shaker chair, ancient Chinese ceramics, shoes worn by [[Marlene Dietrich]] and a photo of Wilson and Glass taken in the early 1980s by [[Robert Mapplethorpe]].&lt;ref name=rachel/&gt;

In 2011, Wilson designed an art park dedicated to the Finnish designer [[Tapio Wirkkala]] (1915–1985), situated in the [[Arabianranta]] district of Helsinki. His plans for the rectangular park feature a central square divided into nine equally sized fields separated by bushes. Each field will be installed with objects related to the home. For example, one unit will consist of a small fireplace surrounded by stones that serve as seating. The park will be lit by large, lightbox-style lamps build into the ground and by smaller ones modelled on ordinary floor lamps.&lt;ref&gt;Clemens Bomsdorf (June 28, 2011), [http://www.theartnewspaper.com/articles/Helsinki-to-get-new-art-park/24045 Helsinki to get new art park] ''[[The Art Newspaper]]''.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Style==

===Language===
Language is one of the most important elements of theatre and Robert Wilson feels at home with commanding it in many different ways. Wilson's impact on this part of theatre alone is immense. [[Arthur Holmberg]], Professor of Theatre at [[Brandeis University]], says that "In theatre, no one has dramatized the crisis of language with as much ferocious genius as Robert Wilson".&lt;ref name=ho&gt;Holmberg, Arthur (1996) [https://books.google.com/books?id=GAjTK98rIwkC ''The Theatre Of Robert Wilson''], Cambridge: Cambridge UP {{ISBN|978-0-52136-492-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|41}} Wilson makes it evident in his work that what's and why's of language are terribly important and cannot be overlooked. [[Tom Waits]], acclaimed songwriter and collaborator with Wilson, said this about Wilson's unique relationship with words:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Words for Bob are like tacks on the kitchen floor in the dark of night and you're barefoot. So Bob clears a path he can walk through words without getting hurt. Bob changes the values and shapes of words. In some sense they take on more meaning; in some cases, less.&lt;ref name=ho /&gt;{{rp|43}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Wilson shows the importance of language through all of his works and in many varying fashions. He credits his reading of the work of [[Gertrude Stein]] and listening to recordings of her speaking with "changing [his] way of thinking forever."&lt;ref&gt;"Director's Notes" in a program for Stein's ''Four Saints in Three Acts'', quoted in Sarah Bay-Cheng (2004) [https://books.google.com/books?id=FFSTAgAAQBAJ ''Mama Dada: Gertrude Stein's Avant-Garde Theater''], p. 135, New York: Routledge {{ISBN|978-0-20350-302-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; Wilson directed three of Stein's works in the 1990s: ''[[Doctor Faustus Lights the Lights]]'' (1992), ''[[Four Saints in Three Acts]]'' (1996), and ''Saints and Singing'' (1998).

Wilson considers language and, down to its very ingredients, words, as a sort of "a social artifact".&lt;ref name=ho/&gt;{{rp|44}} Not only does language change with time but it changes with person, with culture. Using his experience of working with mentally handicapped children and enlisting the collaboration of [[Christopher Knowles]], a renowned autistic poet, has allowed Wilson attack language from many views. Wilson embraces this by often "juxtaposing levels of diction – Miltonic opulence and contemporary ling, crib poetry and pre-verbal screams" in an attempt to show his audience how elusive language really is and how ever-changing it can be.&lt;ref name=ho/&gt;{{rp|44}} Visually showing words is another method Wilson uses to show the beauty of language. Often his set designs, program covers, and posters are graffiti'd with words. This allows the audience to look at the "language itself" rather than "the objects and meanings it refers to.".&lt;ref name=ho/&gt;{{rp|45}}

The lack of language becomes essential to Wilson's work as well. In the same way an artist uses positive and negative space, Wilson uses noise and silence. In working on a production of ''[[King Lear]]'', Wilson inadvertently describes his necessity of silence:

&lt;blockquote&gt;The way actors are trained here is wrong. All they think about is interpreting a text. They worry about how to speak words and know nothing about their bodies. You see that by the way they walk. They don't understand the weight of a gesture in space. A good actor can command an audience by moving one finger.&lt;ref name=ho /&gt;{{rp|49}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;

This emphasis on silence is fully explored in some of his works. ''[[Deafman Glance]]'' is a play without words, and his adaptation of [[Heiner Müller]]'s play ''{{Interlanguage link multi|Quartett (play)|de|3=Quartett (Heiner Müller)|lt=Quartet}}'' contained a fifteen-minute wordless prologue. Holmberg describes these works stating, 

&lt;blockquote&gt;Language does many things and does them well. But we tend to shut our eyes to what language does not do well. Despite the arrogance of words – they rule traditional theatre with an iron fist – not all experience can be translated into a linguistic code.&lt;ref name=ho /&gt;{{rp|50}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Celebrated twentieth century playwright [[Eugène Ionesco]] said that Wilson "surpassed [[Samuel Beckett|Beckett]]" because "[Wilson's] silence is a silence that speaks".&lt;ref name=ho/&gt;{{rp|52}} This silence onstage may be unnerving to audience members but serves a purpose of showing how important language is by its absence. It is Wilson's means of answering his own question: "Why is it no one looks? Why is it no one knows how to look? Why does no one see anything on stage?".&lt;ref name=ho/&gt;{{rp|52}}

Another technique Wilson uses is that of what words can mean to a particular character. His piece, ''I was sitting on my patio this guy appeared I thought I was hallucinating'', features only two characters, both of whom deliver the same stream-of-consciousness monologue. In the play's first production one character was "aloof, cold, [and] precise" while the other "brought screwball comedy… warmth and color… playful[ness]".&lt;ref name=ho /&gt;{{rp|61}} The different emphases and deliveries brought to the monologue two different meanings; "audiences found it hard to believe they heard the same monologue twice".&lt;ref name=ho /&gt;{{rp|61}} Rather than tell his audience what words are supposed to mean, he opens them up for interpretation, presenting the idea that "meanings are not tethered to words like horses to hitching posts".&lt;ref name=ho /&gt;{{rp|61}}

===Movement===
Movement is another key element in Wilson's work. As a dancer, he sees the importance of the way an actor moves onstage and knows the weight their movement bears. When speaking of his "play without words" rendition of [[Ibsen]]'s ''[[When We Dead Awaken]]'', Wilson says:

&lt;blockquote&gt;I do movement before we work on the text. Later we'll put text and movement together. I do movement first to make sure it's strong enough to stand on its own two feet without words. The movement must have a rhythm and structure of its own. It must not follow the text. It can reinforce a text without illustrating it. What you hear and what you see are two different layers. When you put them together, you create another texture.&lt;ref name=ho /&gt;{{rp|136}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;

With such an emphasis on movement, Wilson even tailors his auditions around the necessity of it. In his auditions, "Wilson often does an elaborate movement sequence" and "asks the actor to repeat it".&lt;ref name=ho /&gt;{{rp|136}} [[Thomas Derrah]], an actor in ''[[the CIVIL warS]]'', found the audition process to be baffling: "When I went in, [Wilson] asked me to walk across the room on a count of 31, sit down on a count of 7, put my hand to my forehead on a count of 59. I was mystified by the whole process".&lt;ref name=ho /&gt;{{rp|137}} To further cement the importance of movement in Wilson's works, [[Seth Goldstein]], another actor in ''the CIVIL warS'', stated "every movement from the moment I walked onto the platform until I left was choreographed to the second. During the scene at table all I did was count movements. All I thought about was timing".&lt;ref name=ho /&gt;{{rp|137}}

When it comes time to add the text in with movement, there is still much work to be done. Wilson pays close attention to the text and still makes sure there is enough "space around a text" in order for the audience to soak it up.&lt;ref name=ho/&gt;{{rp|139}} At this point, the actors know their movements and the time in which they are executed, allowing Wilson to tack the actions onto specific pieces of text. His overall goal is to have the rhythm of the text differ from that of the movement so his audience can see them as two completely different pieces, seeing each as what it is. When in the text/movement stage, Wilson often interrupts the rehearsal, saying things like "Something is wrong. We have to check your scripts to see if you put the numbers in the right place".&lt;ref name=ho /&gt;{{rp|139}} He goes on to explain the importance of this:

&lt;blockquote&gt;I know it's hell to separate text and movement and maintain two different rhythms. It takes time to train yourself to keep tongue and body working against each other. But things happen with the body that have nothing to do with what we say. It's more interesting if the mind and the body are in two different places, occupying different zones of reality.&lt;ref name=ho /&gt;{{rp|139}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;

These rhythms keep the mind on its toes, consciously and subconsciously taking in the meanings behind the movement and how it is matching up with the language.

Similar to Wilson's use of the lack of language in his works, he also sees the importance that a lack of movement can have. In his production of ''[[Medea]]'', Wilson arranged a scene in which the lead singer stood still during her entire song while many others moved around her. Wilson recalls that "she complained that if I didn't give her any movements, no one would notice her. I told her if she knew how to stand, everyone would watch her. I told her to stand like a marble statue of a goddess who had been standing in the same spot for a thousand years".&lt;ref name=ho /&gt;{{rp|147}} Allowing an actor to have such stage presence without ever saying a word is very provocative, which is precisely what Wilson means to accomplish with any sense of movement he puts on the stage.

===Lighting===
Wilson believes that, "The most important part of theatre" is light.&lt;ref name=ho/&gt;{{rp|121}} He is concerned with how images are defined onstage, and this is related to the light of an object or tableau. He feels that the lighting design can really bring the production to life. The set designer for Wilson's ''[[The Civil Wars: A Tree Is Best Measured When It Is Down|the CIVIL warS]]'', [[Tom Kamm]], describes his philosophy: "a set for Wilson is a canvas for the light to hit like paint".&lt;ref name=ho /&gt;{{rp|121}} He explains, "If you know how to light, you can make shit look like gold. I paint, I build, I compose with light. Light is a magic wand".&lt;ref name=ho /&gt;{{rp|121}}

Wilson is "the only major director to get billing as a lighting designer" and is recognized by some as "the greatest light artist of our time".&lt;ref name=ho /&gt;{{rp|122}} He designs with light to be flowing rather than an off-and-on pattern, thus making his lighting "like a musical score".&lt;ref name=ho /&gt;{{rp|123}} Wilson's lighting designs feature "dense, palpable textures" and allow "people and objects to leap out from the background".&lt;ref name=ho /&gt;{{rp|123}} In his design for ''Quartett'', Wilson used four hundred light cues in a span of only ninety minutes.&lt;ref name=ho /&gt;{{rp|122}}

He is a perfectionist, persisting to achieve every aspect of his vision. A fifteen-minute monologue in ''Quartett'' took two days for him to light while a single hand gesture took nearly three hours.&lt;ref name=ho /&gt;{{rp|126}} This attention to detail expresses his conviction that, "light is the most important actor on stage".&lt;ref name=ho /&gt;{{rp|128}}

===Props===
Wilson's interest in design extends to the props in his productions, which he designs and sometimes participates in constructing. Whether it is furniture, a light bulb, or a giant crocodile, Wilson treats each as a work of art in its own right. He demands that a full-scale model of each prop be constructed before the final one is made, in order "to check proportion, balance, and visual relationships" on stage.&lt;ref name=ho /&gt;{{rp|128}} Once he has approved the model, the crew builds the prop, and Wilson is "renowned for sending them back again and again and again until they satisfy him".&lt;ref name=ho /&gt;{{rp|128}} He is so strict in his attention to detail that when [[Jeff Muscovin]], his tech director for ''Quartett'', suggested they use an aluminum chair with a wood skin rather than a completely wooden chair, Wilson replied:

&lt;blockquote&gt;No, Jeff, I want wood chairs. If we make them out of aluminum, they won't sound right when they fall over and hit the floor. They'll sound like metal, not wood. It will sound false. Just make sure you get strong wood. And no knots.&lt;ref name=ho /&gt;{{rp|129}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Such attention to detail and perfectionism usually resulted in an expensive collection of props. "Curators regard them as sculptures",&lt;ref name=ho /&gt;{{rp|129}} and the props have been sold for prices ranging from "$4,500 to $80,000".&lt;ref&gt;Gussow, Mel (1998) ''Theatre On The Edge'', New York: Applause {{ISBN|978-1-55783-311-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|113}}

In 1991 Wilson established [[The Watermill Center]] on the site of a former Western Union laboratory on the East End of Long Island, New York.

The Center is situated within a 10-acre campus of gardens and designed landscape, and contains numerous works of art collected by Wilson.

'''Sins Invalid''' is a performance project that focuses on inclusion of people with disabilities while also celebrating intersecting identities. The project was conceived and is led by disabled people of color, and its mission is to provide a space in which those with physical impairments, people who belong to a sensory minority, people with emotional disabilities, people with cognitive challenges, and those with chronic/severe illness can engage in development of artistic performance.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|title = Our Mission  {{!}}  About Us  {{!}}  Sins Invalid|url = http://www.sinsinvalid.org/mission.html|website = www.sinsinvalid.org|accessdate = 2015-11-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to multidisciplinary performances by people with disabilities, Sins Invalid also provides political education workshops for social justice-oriented community organizations that coalesce around similar themes of disability, race, gender, and sexuality.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Founding and Documentary ==
Sins Invalid was founded in 2005 by Patricia Berne and [[Leroy F. Moore Jr.|Leroy F. Moore Jr]]. The organization, which Berne has described as "a hybrid between a community-based organization and a performance," originated in the San Francisco Bay Area and tours nationally.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;''Sins Invalid: An Unshamed Claim to Beauty in the Face of Invisibility''. Dir. Patricia Berne. New Day Films, 2013. DVD.&lt;/ref&gt; Berne and Moore, who are old friends, have both had disabilities since birth, and they started the project upon realizing the paucity of venues dedicated to celebration of their work and their bodies.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Both co-Founders have a long history of advocacy and activism in various fields. Berne serves as Director of the organization, and she has been involved in work surrounding asylum claims, youth incarceration alternatives, the LGBTQIA community, and mental health support for survivors of violence, among other fields.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite web|title = Who We Are  {{!}}  About Us  {{!}}  Sins Invalid|url = http://sinsinvalid.org/artistic_core.html|website = sinsinvalid.org|accessdate = 2015-11-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; Moore is Sins Invalid's Community Relations Director. His work extends to writing, poetry, lecture series, and hip-hop/music. He has worked, studied, and lectured internationally and is considered a "leading voice" regarding police brutality toward and wrongful incarceration of people with disabilities.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

According to a ''[[The Huffington Post|Huffington Post]]'' interview conducted by Cory Silverburg with Berne and Moore, Sins Invalid's (pronounced as in "not valid") name came from the idea that a disabled child is a manifestation of "the sins of the father being cast upon the son".&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite web|title = When it Comes to Sex, Are Your Sins Invalid?|url = http://www.huffingtonpost.com/cory-silverberg/when-it-comes-to-sex-are-_b_838404.html|website = The Huffington Post|accessdate = 2015-11-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; As Berne articulates, there is a pervasive societal norm that validates bodies according to beauty, hygienic, health, and other sets of standards. The Sins Invalid framework asserts that humans have a wide variety of embodiments, and all bodies are valid and worthy of celebration.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; It is also a play on words, since people with disabilities have historically been referred to as "invalids".&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

Since its creation, Sins Invalid has held annual major theater performances and an artist-in-residence performance, which have all received critical acclaim.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; In 2012, the project launched a [[Kickstarter]] campaign, culminating in the 2013 release of a 32-minute documentary titled ''[http://www.sinsinvalid.org/film.html Sins Invalid: An Unshamed Claim to Beauty in the Face of Invisibility]'', directed by Berne, which details its disability justice efforts and the value of artistic expression. The documentary also elucidates the need for inclusion of sex and sexuality in disability rights discourse.

== Disability and Sexuality ==
Sins Invalid makes the conscious choice to engage in the topic of sexuality precisely because it has historically been so taboo, especially when it intersects with disability and other social markers. The discussion of identity is also vital here, especially in terms of creating a space for identities that have become politicized as a result of socialization. In an interview with [[Icarus Project|The Icarus Project]], Berne cites the high rates of sexual violence against people with disabilities, tying the trend to an issue of dehumanization, not sexualization.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Interview w/Sins Invalid on Disability Justice Theory &amp; Praxis {{!}} The Icarus Project|url = http://www.theicarusproject.net/article/interview-wsins-invalid-on-disability-justice-theory-praxis|website = www.theicarusproject.net|accessdate = 2015-11-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the World Health Organization, adults with disabilities are 1.5 times as likely to experience any type of violence—physical, emotional, sexual—than adults without disabilities.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite web|title = WHO {{!}} Violence against adults and children with disabilities|url = http://www.who.int/disabilities/violence/en/|website = www.who.int|accessdate = 2015-11-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; Adults with mental or intellectual impairments are almost four times as likely to experience violence than those without. Children with disabilities are 3.7 times as likely to experience any type of violence than children without disabilities. Children with disabilities are 3.6 times as likely to experience physical violence and 2.9 times as likely to experience sexual violence. Children with mental or intellectual impairments are 4.6 times as likely to experience sexual violence than their counterparts.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

The WHO attributes these alarming statistics to stigma, discrimination, ignorance, and lack of social support, but Berne echoes scholars in the disability studies field, who argue that the issue runs deeper.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; The discussion of disability and sexuality, based on cultural assumptions, categorizes the combination under [[sexual deviance]]. Public perception of those who are differently abled has come to form the disabled body as one incapable of attaining sexual [[Agency (sociology)|agency]].&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Disability, Sex Radicalism, and Political Agency|url = https://muse.jhu.edu/journals/nwsa_journal/v014/14.3wilkerson.html|journal = NWSA Journal|date = 2002-01-01|issn = 2151-7371|pages = 33–57|volume = 14|issue = 3|first = Abby L.|last = Wilkerson}}&lt;/ref&gt; Philosopher and disability studies scholar Abby Wilkerson has written that, in order to respect the sexual agency of all individuals, this agency must be reimagined as political.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; Her argument hinges on the assumption of the disabled body as incapable of becoming a full citizen. Reimagining sexual and political agency is an aspect of the overall effort to change views and frames regarding disability and the perception of disabled bodies.

In the Cory Silverberg interview, Berne said, "I can experience my sexuality as a crip, as someone who fully occupies a non-normative physical space. And part of that movement to fully living in one's own experience is naming and resisting dehumanization."&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Acknowledging the full history of disability in the United States requires a deconstruction of the dehumanizing practices that have plagued the community. All types of experiences are included in the show, and the denial of sexuality is part of that dehumanization. In the same interview, Moore said, "…we’re sharing these stories in a way that hopefully connects us to our past and also allows us to change our future."&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; The medicalized framing of disability has framed it as a problem to be cured, a pathology that decides, alongside doctors, the future of its host.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Stolen Bodies, Reclaimed Bodies: Disability and Queerness|url = https://muse.jhu.edu/journals/public_culture/v013/13.3clare.html|journal = Public Culture|date = 2001-01-01|issn = 1527-8018|pages = 359–365|volume = 13|issue = 3|first = Eli|last = Clare}}&lt;/ref&gt; People with disabilities are often told what their futures will look or feel like, and part of gaining agency involves the decision one makes when deciding one's future for oneself. Sins Invalid aims to reinforce this agency and choice in the futures of people with disabilities, including an audience in order to expand the message and so that people with and without disabilities might internalize it.

=== Eugenics ===
The documentary alludes to [[Harry H. Laughlin|Harry Laughlin]]'s 1914 coining of the "Five Ds," or people who should not, according to the tenets of eugenics, reproduce. These are degenerate, dependent, deficient, delinquent, and defective.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Sins Invalid's work is not solely a matter of performance; rather, it is an active fight against the idea that people with disabilities should not exist.

The history of [[eugenics]] in the United States dates back to before World War II, in which the eugenics programs provided inspiration for practices in Nazi Germany. During the late 19th and early 20th century, it came to be seen as "a method of preserving and improving the dominant groups in the population," and it was not until later that its racist, nativist, and ableist elements were unearthed and included in public discourse. There were various pieces of legislation mirroring eugenics practice in the US. In the documentary, performers reference being referred to as "an excuse for abortion".&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Increasing access to sex, sexuality, and reproduction for people with disabilities is a cornerstone of disability justice and the ability to be viewed as a full citizen with the same privileges afforded to those without disabilities. Sins Invalid's performances and community engagement fosters these efforts and includes them in its framework.

==== Forced sterilization ====
Sterilization is part of eugenics, and the US had legislation making it compulsory for "imbeciles" for a large part of the early 20th century. The documentary touches on the fact that, between 1910 and 1970, over 60,000 individuals were [[Compulsory sterilization|forcibly sterilized]] in the US, with many more undocumented cases.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Sins Invalid works against the frame that the world would be better off without people with disabilities and that others should decide their reproductive futures.

Though the issue of forced sterilization still exists in this country, it has been occurring more commonly in women's prisons.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Female inmates sterilized in California prisons without approval {{!}} The Center for Investigative Reporting|url = http://cironline.org/reports/female-inmates-sterilized-california-prisons-without-approval-4917|website = cironline.org|accessdate = 2015-11-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Intersectionality ==
Sins Invalid's acceptance and celebration of the multiplicity and diversity of identities is an iteration of [[intersectionality]] in practice. The human body is not permanent and unchanging; rather, it is a non-static being that can change based on nature, the environment, or perception. Since disability does not discriminate, it is useful as a category of analysis in terms of its potential to create, as disability studies scholar Simi Linton puts it, "a prism through which one can gain a broader understanding of society and human experience".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Feminist Disability Studies|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=llOJkIHd3lsC|publisher = Indiana University Press|date = 2011-01-01|isbn = 0253223407|first = Kim Q.|last = Hall}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since Sins Invalid includes performers with disabilities who are also people of color, queer, etc., intersectionality is woven into its performances and guiding ideology. In the documentary, Sins Invalid member Leah Lakshmi Piepzna-Samarasinha comments on the freedom that the space provides for various manifestations of difference, such as queerness. She says, "No one has to closet themselves," and this applies to any identity.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; This ties into Berne's idea of being able to "orient the gaze," or the position the audience occupies as consumers of the performance.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Since the project is conscious of so many diverse lenses and does not limit the frame to disability, performers and audience members alike have the opportunity to feel empowered by the acknowledgement of identities.

In order to understand the idea of embodiment, of occupying the body, as Berne states, one must have an understanding of the body as situated within a historical, political, cultural, and social context.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Embodying Our Humanity: Sins Invalid Promotes Disability Justice through Live Performance Arts|url = http://www.tikkun.org/tikkundaily/2014/10/03/embodying-our-humanity-sins-invalid-promotes-disability-justice-through-live-performance-arts/|website = Tikkun Daily Blog|accessdate = 2015-11-25|language = en-us}}&lt;/ref&gt; Feminist disability studies scholar Rosemarie Garland-Thomson argues that, "integrating disability as a category of analysis and a system of representation deepens, expands, and challenges feminist theory".&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Feminist Disability Studies|jstor = 10.1086/423352|journal = Signs|date = 2005-01-01|pages = 1557–1587|volume = 30|issue = 2|doi = 10.1086/423352|first = Rosemarie|last = Garland‐Thomson}}&lt;/ref&gt; She is, essentially, arguing for a more intersectional approach to both fields, allowing conversation across coalitions and co-opting of messages and theories. For Garland-Thomson, the "shared human experience of embodiment" provides a framework in which all individuals should be able to understand the way systems affect or do not affect them based on their bodies.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; The sharing of experience should, theoretically, make difference more palatable in interpersonal relationships. In the documentary, however, one of the performances includes narration that says, "We labor to shield you from our differences…We live in continual risk."&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; People with disabilities, both visible and invisible, live with a higher risk of experiencing violence and an extreme amount of pressure to conform. The more identities intersect with one another, the more complicated it becomes to navigate spaces that are unwelcoming or biased. Sins Invalid aims to address this difficulty through creating a performance space that is inviting to all identities.

== Objectives ==
A review by Terry Rowden states, "Moving decisively beyond any simple ‘shock’ or ‘transgressive’ aesthetic…challenges the politics that systematically disables our ability to recognize beauty."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = NOW AVAILABLE FOR PURCHASE – THE SINS INVALID FILM {{!}} Sins Invalid|url = http://sinsinvalid.org/blog/now-available-for-purchase-the-sins-invalid-film|website = sinsinvalid.org|accessdate = 2015-11-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sins Invalid has, for certain audience members, achieved its goal of redefining ideas like beauty, sex, and sexuality. Further, Berne has described the project as, "an erotic event featuring people with disabilities". Sins Invalid harnesses the power of the erotic, using it as a force in politicizing the disabled body. According to Audre Lorde, the erotic is a means to assert power for people who have historically been denied agency. She writes, "The erotic is a measure between our sense of self and the chaos of our strongest feelings."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Audre Lorde on the Erotic|url = http://www.english.illinois.edu/maps/poets/g_l/lorde/erotic.htm|website = www.english.illinois.edu|accessdate = 2015-11-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her argument is based on those in power suppressing or repressing eroticism, feeling, and emotion, dismissing each as weak and without value. Sins Invalid's invocation of the erotic is a means to empower those who have been denied a space for expression in the public sphere.

Another concept that Sins Invalid confronts is [[shame]]. In his book ''The Trouble with Normal'', Michael Warner writes about shame as a "political resource that some people use to silence or isolate others."&lt;ref name=":9"&gt;{{Cite web|title = The Trouble with Normal — Michael Warner {{!}} Harvard University Press|url = http://www.hup.harvard.edu/catalog.php?isbn=9780674004412|website = www.hup.harvard.edu|accessdate = 2015-11-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; In his view, sexual deviants are considered a "danger to the body politic."&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt; Analyzing the politics of shame in a disability rights discourse requires the acknowledgement that people with disabilities are framed as objects of shame. Sins Invalid seeks to address this issue through the assertion that their claim is "unshamed" from the get-go. Furthermore, unabashedly claiming sex and sexuality in an empowering way serves to eliminate the shame that people with disabilities may become subject to.

Berne and Moore have both expressed a commitment to concrete change. For Moore, this manifests in changing laws, but going further and beginning to change our physical environment.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Berne writes on the move from individual legal rights toward a collective human rights framework. Berne's writing speaks to both types of change. She uses herself as an example, discussing the fact that her wheelchair does not climb stairs and asking the reader if this is a problem with the wheelchair or a problem with the stairs.&lt;ref name=":8"&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = Sins Invalid: An Unshamed Claim to Beauty in the Face of Invisibility|last = Berne|first = Patricia|date = |journal = |doi = |pmid = }}&lt;/ref&gt; She encourages her audience to think critically about our surroundings and the barriers that exist for various members of society due to identity. Berne and Moore both view the oppression of the non-normative body as something to move beyond, toward opportunities for liberation and beauty and a new vision of embodiment.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt;

'''StoryCorps''' is an American [[non-profit organization]] whose mission is to record, preserve, and share the stories of Americans from all backgrounds and beliefs. StoryCorps grew out of Sound Portraits Productions as a project founded in 2003 by radio producer [[David Isay]]. Its headquarters are located in the [[Fort Greene, Brooklyn|Fort Greene]] neighborhood of [[Brooklyn]], [[New York (state)|New York]].

StoryCorps is modeled—in spirit and in scope—after the efforts of the [[Works Progress Administration]] (WPA) of the 1930s, through which oral history interviews across the [[United States]] were recorded. Another inspiration for the organization was [[oral history|oral historian]] [[Studs Terkel]], who cut the ribbon at the opening of StoryCorps’ first recording booth in [[Grand Central Terminal]]. To date, StoryCorps has recorded more than 60,000 interviews among more than 100,000 participants in all 50 states, Washington, D.C., and several American territories.

==Interviews==
StoryCorps interviews usually take place between two people who know and care about each other. They can be friends, family, or mere acquaintances. A trained StoryCorps facilitator guides participants through the interview process. At the end of each 40-minute recording session, participants receive a complimentary [[Compact Disc|CD]] of their interview and are requested to make a $50 donation to offset the recording costs. With participant permission, a second copy of each interview is archived at the [[American Folklife Center]] at the [[Library of Congress]] for future generations to hear. Segments of select interviews may air nationally on [[NPR]]’s ''[[Morning Edition]]''. These interviews can also be heard on the StoryCorps website.

==Recording methods==
There are several ways by which participants can record their stories.

===StoryBooth===
Participants can visit StoryBooths, which are small, publicly accessible recording studios located in public places. The first StoryBooth opened in [[New York City]]’s Grand Central Terminal on October 23, 2003, and was moved to [[Lower Manhattan]]’s [[Foley Square]] in July 2005. The second StoryBooth opened at the [[Contemporary Jewish Museum]] in [[San Francisco]] in October 2008. The third StoryBooth opened at [[Atlanta]]’s public radio station [[WABE]] in October 2009.

===MobileBooth===
[[File:StoryCorps booth vehicle.jpg|thumb|A StoryCorps MobileBooth parked at the Library of Congress]]
In May 2005, two StoryCorps MobileBooths built from converted [[Airstream]] trailers began traveling the country, recording stories in various cities year-round.

===Services===
StoryCorps offers three additional recordings services for those who are unable to visit a StoryCorps booth. The Door-to-Door service sends teams of StoryCorps facilitators to temporary recording locations throughout the United States for several days at a time. The StoryKit service ships a professional quality, portable recording device to participants around the country. The “Do-It-Yourself” service allows individuals to download free step-by-step interview instructions, equipment recommendations, and a “Great Question” list to conduct interviews using their own recording equipment.

=== StoryCorps App ===
With the support of the 2015 TED Prize and the 2014 Knight Prototype Fund, StoryCorps has developed a free app that allows users to record interviews on a smartphone. The app helps users prepare questions and provides tips for setting up the right recording environment. Users can upload their interviews to the StoryCorps.me website, and all interviews are archived at the American Folklife Center at the Library of Congress. The StoryCorps App and StoryCorps.me are currently in public beta.

==Initiatives==
StoryCorps collaborates with groups, organizations, and institutions all over the country. Specifically, StoryCorps currently supports seven major initiatives that seek to reach out to the widest range of participants.&lt;ref&gt;StoryCorps Initiatives, http://storycorps.org/initiatives/, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;
*The '''Military Voices Initiative''' records, shares, and preserves the stories of post-9/11 veterans, active-duty service members, and their families. 
* The '''Memory Loss Initiative''' encourages individuals with [[Alzheimer's disease]] and other forms of [[memory loss]] to share their stories.
* The '''Historias Initiative''' collects the stories of [[Hispanic and Latino Americans|Latinos]] throughout the United States and [[Puerto Rico]].
* The '''[[Griot]] Initiative''' preserves the voices and experiences of [[African Americans]].  These stories will be archived at the [[National Museum of African American History and Culture]] and the [[American Folklife Center]] at the [[Library of Congress]].
* The '''September 11 Initiative''' honors and remembers the stories of survivors, rescue workers, and others most personally affected by the events of [[September 11 attacks|September 11, 2001]].
* '''OutLoud''' seeks to record and preserve a diverse collection of LGBTQ stories across America.
* The '''Justice Project''' amplifies and preserves the stories of those whose lives have been impacted by mass incarceration and the criminal justice system.

== Community programs ==
StoryCorps currently has four community programs.
* Through the '''MobileBooth Tour''', StoryCorps visits cities and towns across the country to record the stories of the people who live there. The MobileBooth Tour partners with local public radio stations, cultural institutions and community-based organizations to get the word out and invite participants to bring someone to the StoryCorps MobileBooth.
* '''StoryCorps Legacy''' provides opportunities for people with serious illness, and their relatives, to record and share their life stories. StoryCorps Legacy partners with organizations across the country, including hospitals and clinics, pediatric centers, hospice and palliative care departments, and disease specific organizations.
* '''StoryCorpsU (SCU)''' is a year-long, cross-disciplinary (language arts, media, history), youth development program designed for 9th and 10th graders to help students develop self and social awareness, academic skills, and strengthened school relationships. SCU uses StoryCorps’ tested interviewing techniques, combined with outstanding radio broadcasts and animated shorts, to support high school students in the development of identity and in drawing connections between their unique strengths and the college application process. For the 2016-2017 school year, SCU will be implemented in nine schools, more than 30 classrooms, and seven cities. The program was most recently evaluated in 2015 by Dr. Ronald Ferguson, a leading national researcher on racial and economic achievement gaps in education.
* The '''StoryCorps Archive''' is the largest born-digital collection of human voices. The collection is housed and can be accessed at the American Folklife Center at the Library of Congress in Washington D.C.

== Criticism ==
StoryCorps has been criticized on multiple fronts. While it has been called been called “an oral history of America,”&lt;ref&gt;“StoryCorps, An Oral History of America: Sound Booths Will Record Ordinary People’s Life Stories,” National Public Radio, October 23, 2003, http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId1⁄41475619, accessed November 5, 2018.&lt;/ref&gt; oral historians have critiqued the project’s methodology, specifically the "highly sculpted techniques of the interviews"&lt;ref&gt; Nancy Abelmann and Susan Davis and Cara Finnegan and Peggy Miller et. al. "What is StoryCorps, Anyway?" Oral History Review 36, no. 2 (2009): 255. https://muse.jhu.edu/ (accessed November 5, 2018)&lt;/ref&gt;, such as the pre-scripted questions, the 40-minute time limit, and the presence of a StoryCorps staff member in the recording booth. The result of the technique is that interviews often elicit "an often-rehearsed moment, story, or memory." &lt;ref&gt; Nancy Abelmann and Susan Davis and Cara Finnegan and Peggy Miller et. al. "What is StoryCorps, Anyway?" Oral History Review 36, no. 2 (2009): 255. https://muse.jhu.edu/ (accessed November 5, 2018)&lt;/ref&gt;

Historians are also critical of the post-interview editing process, which they argue favor highly emotional and predictable narrative arcs.&lt;ref&gt; Nancy Abelmann and Susan Davis and Cara Finnegan and Peggy Miller et. al. "What is StoryCorps, Anyway?" Oral History Review 36, no. 2 (2009): 258. https://muse.jhu.edu/ (accessed November 5, 2018)&lt;/ref&gt; StoryCorps stories typically feature tales of survival, which, as one historian has argued, perpetuates an “interpretive straightjacket of the neoliberal belief that people have their fates in their own hands.”&lt;ref&gt; Freund, Alexander. “Under Storytelling’s Spell? Oral History in a Neoliberal Age.” Oral History Review, vol. 42, no. 1, Winter/Spring  ///Winter/Spring2015 2015, pp. 13. EBSCOhost, doi:10.1093/ohr/ohv002.&lt;/ref&gt;

StoryCorps has also been criticized for how its stories are framed on [[Morning Edition]]. For example, in a 2016 story, an elderly man confessed to having stolen $2 from his home that had been left for Pearl, his family’s female, African American domestic servant. When Pearl insisted that she had not been paid that week, she was fired.&lt;ref&gt;Morning Edition. “A Lifelong Secret: Can You Help This Ailing 94-Year-Old Man Make Amends?” NPR.Org, https://www.npr.org/2016/12/09/504828481/a-lifelong-secret-can-you-help-this-ailing-94-year-old-man-make-amends. Accessed 6 Nov. 2018.
&lt;/ref&gt; The title NPR gave the story - "A Lifelong Secret: Can You Help This Ailing 94-Year-Old Man Make Amends?" - as well as [[Steve Inskeep]]’s closing request for listeners to help find Pearl drew ire from listeners, who found the sympathetic portrayal of the man to be misguided and offensive.&lt;ref&gt;Jensen, Elizabeth. “Poorly Framed StoryCorps ‘Experiment’ Misfires.” NPR.Org, https://www.npr.org/sections/ombudsman/2016/12/15/505567780/poorly-framed-storycorps-experiment-misfires. Accessed 6 Nov. 2018.
&lt;/ref&gt; One user wrote “waiting nearly a century to try to seek amends is horrific.” Another user suggested changing StoryCorps’ hashtag from #FindPearl to “FindJUSTICEforPearl.”&lt;ref&gt;Jensen, Elizabeth. “Poorly Framed StoryCorps ‘Experiment’ Misfires.” NPR.Org, https://www.npr.org/sections/ombudsman/2016/12/15/505567780/poorly-framed-storycorps-experiment-misfires. Accessed 6 Nov. 2018.
&lt;/ref&gt; In response to criticism, NPR acknowledged that “the segment comes across, even if this was not the attempt, as trying to manufacture a “feel good” feature.”&lt;ref&gt;Jensen, Elizabeth. “Poorly Framed StoryCorps ‘Experiment’ Misfires.” NPR.Org, https://www.npr.org/sections/ombudsman/2016/12/15/505567780/poorly-framed-storycorps-experiment-misfires. Accessed 6 Nov. 2018.
&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Adriaen van Ostade 006.jpg|thumb|250px|right|[[Adriaen van Ostade]]. ''Selfportrait.'' 1663. [[Gemäldegalerie]].]]

A '''studio''' is an [[artist]] or worker's workroom. This can be for the purpose of [[acting]], [[architecture]], [[painting]], [[pottery]] ([[ceramic]]s), [[sculpture]], [[origami]], [[woodworking]], [[scrapbooking]], [[photography]], [[graphic design]], [[filmmaking]], [[animation]], [[industrial design]], [[radio]] or [[television production]] [[broadcasting]] or the making of [[music]]. The term is also used for the workroom of [[dancer]]s, often specified to [[dance studio]].

The word ''studio'' is derived from the {{Lang-it|studio}}, from {{Lang-lat|studium}}, from ''studere'', meaning to [[Wiktionary:study|study]] or zeal.

The French term for studio, '''[[atelier]]''', in addition to designating an artist's studio is used to characterize the studio of a fashion designer. Atelier also has the connotation of being the home of an [[alchemy|alchemist]] or [[Magician (paranormal)|wizard]].

''Studio'' is also a metonym for the group of people who work within a particular studio. 

==Art studio==
[[File:Jane Frank Portrait .jpg|thumb|Artist [[Jane Frank]] in her studio, 1960s or 1970s. The studio of a contemporary [[mixed media]] artist can be quite a messy affair.]]

The studio of any artist, especially from the 15th to the 19th centuries, characterized all the assistants, thus the designation of paintings as "from the [[workshop]] of..." or "studio of..."
An art studio is sometimes called an '''atelier''', especially in earlier eras. In contemporary, English language use, "atelier" can also refer to the [[Atelier Method]], a training method for artists that usually takes place in a professional artist's studio. 

The above-mentioned "method" calls upon that zeal for study to play a significant role in the production which occurs in a studio space. A studio is more or less artful to the degree that the artist who occupies it is committed to the continuing education in his or her formal discipline. Academic curricula categorize studio classes in order to prepare students for the rigors of building sets of skills which require a continuity of practice in order to achieve growth and mastery of their artistic expression. A versatile and creative mind will embrace the opportunity of such practice to innovate and experiment, which develops uniquely individual qualities of each artist's expression. Thus the method raises and maintains an art studio space above the level of a mere production facility or workshop.

Safety is or may be a concern in studios, with some painting materials required to be handled, stored, or used properly to prevent poisoning, chemical burns, or fire.&lt;ref&gt;Friel, Michael (2010). ''Still Life Painting Atelier: An Introduction to Oil Painting'', p.20. {{ISBN|978-0-8230-3408-6}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Educational studio==
In educational studios, students learn to develop skills related to design, ranging from architecture to product design.  In specific, educational studios are studio settings where large numbers of students learn to draft and design with instructional help at a college.  Educational studios are colloquially referred to as "studio" by students, who are known for staying up late hours into the night doing projects and socializing.

The studio environment is characterized by 2 types in education:
# The workspace where students do usually visually-centered work in an open environment. This time and space is beyond that of instructional time and faculty guidance is not available. It allows for students to engage each other, help each other, and inspire each other while working.
# A type of class that takes the above-mentioned workshop space, and recreates its core component of an open working environment. It differentiates itself based on a topic of instruction, isolated space, instructor led/included, and an added focus of directed criticism. A great take on this latter type of "studio classroom" is [http://serc.carleton.edu/introgeo/studio/what.html described by Carleton University].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=What is studio teaching?|url=http://serc.carleton.edu/introgeo/studio/what.html|accessdate=22 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Pottery studio==
[[Pottery|Studio pottery]] is made by an individual potter working on his own in his studio, rather than in a ceramics factory (although there may be a design studio within a larger manufacturing site).

==Production studios==
Production studios are those studios which act as centres for the production in any of the [[arts]]; alternatively they can also be the financial and commercial entity behind such endeavours. In radio and [[television production]] studio is the place where programs and [[radio commercial]] and [[television advertising]] are recorded for further emission.

===Animation studio===
[[Animation studio]]s, like [[movie studio]]s, may be production facilities, or financial entities. In some cases, especially in [[anime]], they continue the tradition of a studio where a [[Master tradesman|master]] or group of talented individuals oversee the work of lesser artists and crafts persons in realising their vision. Animation studios are a fast rising entity and they include established firms such as [[The Walt Disney Company|Walt Disney]] and [[Pixar]].

===Comics studio===
Artists or writers, predominantly those producing [[comics]], still employ small studios of staff to assist in the creation of a [[comic strip]], [[comic book]] or [[graphic novel]].  In the early days of [[Dan Dare]], [[Frank Hampson]] employed a number of staff at his studio to help with the production of the strip.  [[Eddie Campbell]] is another creator who has assembled a small studio of colleagues to help him in his art, and the comic book industry of the United States has based its production methods upon the studio system employed at its beginnings.

==Instructional studio==
[[File:Student using Laptop.jpg|thumbnail|right|Student using a laptop in an instructional studio.]]
Many [[University|universities]] are creating studio settings for courses outside the artist's realm. There are several different projects along these lines, most notably the [[SCALE-UP]] (Student-Centered Active Learning Environment for Undergraduate Programs) initiated at [[NC State]].

===Mastering studio===
In audio, a mastering studio is a facility specialised in [[audio mastering]]. Tasks may include but not be limited to audio restoration, corrective and tone-shaping EQ, dynamic control, stereo or 5.1 surround editing, vinyl and tape transfers, vinyl cutting, and CD compilation. Depending on the quality of the original mix, the mastering engineer's role can change from small corrections to improving the overall sound of a mix drastically. Typically studios contain a combination of high-end analogue equipment with low-noise circuitry and digital hardware and plug-ins. Some may contain tape machines and vinyl lathes. They may also contain full-range monitoring systems and be acoustically tuned to provide an accurate reproduction of the sound information contained in the original medium. The mastering engineer must prepare the file for its intended destination, which may be radio, CD, vinyl or digital distribution.

In [[video production]], a mastering studio is a facility specialized in the [[post-production]] of video recordings. Tasks may include but not be limited to: [[video editing]], [[colour grading]] correction, mixing, [[DVD authoring]] and [[audio mastering]]. The mastering engineer must prepare the file for its intended destination, which may be broadcast, DVD or digital distribution.

===Acting studio===

An "acting studio" is an institution or workspace (similar to a dance studio) in which actors rehearse and refine their craft. The [[Neighborhood Playhouse]] and [[Actors Studio]] are legendary acting studios in New York.

===Movie studio===
{{Main|Movie studio}}

A '''movie studio''' is a [[company (law)|company]] which develops, equips and maintains a controlled environment for [[filmmaking]].  This environment may be interior ([[sound stage]]), exterior ([[backlot]]) or both.

===Photographic studio===
{{Main|Photographic studio}}

A photographic studio is both a workspace and a [[corporation|corporate]] body. As a workspace it provides space to take, develop, print and duplicate photographs.

===Radio studio===
{{Main|Radio studio}}

A radio studio is a room in which a [[Radio programming|radio program]] or show is produced, either for live [[Broadcasting|broadcast]] or for recording for a later broadcast.  The room is soundproofed to avoid unwanted noise being mixed into the broadcast.

===Recording studio===
{{Main|Recording studio}}

A recording studio is a facility for [[sound recording]] which generally consists of at least two rooms: the studio or live room, and the control room, where the sound from the studio is recorded and manipulated. They are designed so that they have good [[acoustics]] and so that there is good isolation between the rooms.

===Television studio===
{{Main|Television studio}}

A television studio is an installation in which television or [[video production]]s take place, for [[live television]], for recording [[video tape]], or for the acquisition of raw [[footage]] for [[post-production]]. The design of a studio is similar to, and derived from, [[movie studio]]s, with a few amendments for the special requirements of television production. A professional television studio generally has several rooms, which are kept separate for noise and practicality reasons.

==Yoga and martial arts studios==
Many of the healing arts and activities such as yoga, judo, karate are "studied" in a studio.  It is very common to see yoga studios and martial arts studios established in settings that might previously have been for other uses, described as studios.  These are not really recreation centers, or gyms in the traditional sense, but places where students of these activities practice or study their art.

[[Surrealism]] in [[art]], [[poetry]], and [[literature]] uses numerous '''techniques and games''' to provide inspiration. Many of these are said to free imagination by producing a creative process free of [[consciousness|conscious]] control. The importance of the [[Unconscious mind|unconscious]] as a source of inspiration is central to the nature of surrealism.

The Surrealist movement has been a fractious one since its inception.  The value and role of the various techniques  has been one of many subjects of disagreement. Some Surrealists consider [[surrealist automatism|automatism]] and games to be sources of inspiration only, while others consider them starting points for finished works. Others consider the items created through automatism to be finished works themselves, needing no further refinement.

==Aerography==
{{Main|Aerography (arts)}}
'''Aerography''' is a technique in which a 3-dimensional object is used as a [[stencil]] with [[spraypainting]].

==Automatism==
{{Main|Surrealist automatism}}
* '''Automatic drawing'''
* '''Automatic painting'''
* '''Automatic writing'''
* '''Automatic poetry''' is [[poetry]] written using the [[surrealist automatism|automatic method]].  It has probably been the chief surrealist method from the founding of surrealism to the present day.  One of the oddest uses of automatic writing by a great writer was that of [[W. B. Yeats]]. His wife, a spiritualist, practised it, and Yeats put large chunks of it into his prose work, ''[[A Vision]]'' and much of his later poetry. Yeats, however, was not a surrealist.

Automatic poetry generators exist online, but they do not actually generate automatic poetry in this sense.

The Czech writer [[Bohumil Hrabal]] used the method of automatic text in his famous book ''[[I Served the King of England]]''. One chapter in the book is written as a single sentence, and at the end of the book Hrabal endorses the use of automatic writing.

==Bulletism==
{{Main|Bulletism}}
'''Bulletism''' is shooting [[ink]] at a blank piece of [[paper]]. The artist can then develop images based on what is seen.

==Calligramme==
A '''calligramme''' is a text or [[poem]] of a type developed by [[Guillaume Apollinaire]] in which the words or letters make up a shape, particularly a shape connected to the subject of the text or poem.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ac-nancy-metz.fr/petitspoetes/HTML/SALLESDEJEUX/MEDIASSALLE/apol.gif Examples of calligrammes]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.storyabout.net/typedrawing/ Modern examples and make your own (Flash)]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Collage==
{{Main|Collage}}

'''Collage''' is the assemblage of different forms creating a new whole. For example, an artistic collage work may include newspaper clippings, ribbons, bits of colored or hand-made papers, photographs, etc., glued to a solid support or canvas.

==Coulage==
A '''coulage''' is a kind of [[surrealist automatism|automatic]] or involuntary [[sculpture]] made by pouring a molten material (such as [[metal]], [[wax]], [[chocolate]] or [[white chocolate]]) into cold [[water]].  As the material cools it takes on what appears to be a random (or [[aleatoric]]) form, though the physical properties of the materials involved may lead to a conglomeration of discs or spheres.  The artist may use a variety of techniques to affect the outcome.

This technique is also used in the [[divination]] process known as [[ceromancy]].

==Cubomania==
{{Main|Cubomania}}

'''Cubomania''' is a method of making [[collage]]s in which a picture or [[image]] is cut into squares and the squares are then reassembled without regard for the image.  The technique was first used by the [[Romania]]n surrealist [[Gherasim Luca]].

==Cut-up technique==
{{Main|Cut-up technique}}
'''Cut-up technique''' is a literary form or method in which a text is cut up at random and rearranged to create a new text.

==Decalcomania==
{{Main|Decalcomania}}
'''Decalcomania''' is a process of spreading thick paint upon a canvas then&amp;mdash;while it is still wet&amp;mdash;covering it with further material such as paper or aluminium foil. This covering is then removed (again before the paint dries), and the resultant paint pattern becomes the basis of the finished painting. The technique was much employed by artists such as [[Max Ernst]].

==Dream résumé==
The '''dream résumé''' takes the form of an employment [[résumé]] but chronicles its subject's achievements, employment, or the like, in [[dream]]s, rather than in waking life.  Sometimes dream résumés contain the achievements of both, however.

==Echo poem==
An '''echo poem''' is a [[poem]] written using a technique invented by [[Aurélien Dauguet]] in 1972.  The poem is composed by one or more persons, working together in a process as follows.

The first "[[stanza]]" of the poem is written on the left-hand column of a piece of paper divided into two columns. Then the "opposite", or 'echo', of the first stanza, in whatever sense is appropriate to the poem, is composed in the right-hand column of the page.  The writing is done [[surrealist automatism|automatically]] and often the "opposite" stanza is composed of a [[phonetic]] correspondence to the first stanza.

For a longer work, the third stanza can then begin in the left-hand column as an "opposite" or a phonetic correspondence to what preceded it in the right-hand column. Then the fourth stanza might be an "opposite" or sound correspondence to what preceded it in the left-hand column, and so forth.  When the poem is completed, the echo of the last phrase, line, or sentence, generally serves as the [[title]].

This is unrelated to the non-Surrealist [[echo verse]] form which appears as a dialogue between the questions of a character and [[echo (phenomenon)|the answers]] of the nymph [[Echo (mythology)|Echo]].&lt;ref&gt;A Book of Surrealist Games by Alistair Brotchie - pg. 30&lt;/ref&gt;

==Éclaboussure==
Éclaboussure is a process in Surrealist painting where oil paints or watercolours are laid down and water or turpentine is splattered, then soaked up to reveal random splatters or dots where the media was removed. This technique gives the appearance of space and atmosphere. It was used in paintings by [[Remedios Varo]].

==Entopic graphomania==
'''Entopic graphomania'''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

The method was invented by [[Dolfi Trost]], who as the subtitle of his 1945 book ("''Vision dans le cristal. Oniromancie obsessionelle. Et neuf graphomanies entopiques''") suggests, included nine examples therein.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=jnqtYZvih3QC&amp;pg=PA157&amp;lpg=PA157&amp;dq=Dolfi+Trost+entopiques&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=mA7iCMMKu0&amp;sig=0pMLDylrDYTgrYW6Gil8rnGmkdM&amp;hl=de&amp;ei=oIAHTfuWG8XCswbB0aHtDQ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=6&amp;ved=0CEwQ6AEwBQ#v=onepage&amp;q=Dolfi%20Trost%20entopiques&amp;f=false Google Books]&lt;/ref&gt;  This method of "indecipherable writing" (see below) was supposedly an example of "[[surautomatism]]", the controversial theory put forward by Trost and [[Gherashim Luca]] in which surrealist methods would be practiced that "went beyond" automatism.  In ''Dialectique de Dialectique'' they had proposed the further radicalization of surrealist automatism by abandoning images produced by artistic techniques in favour of those "resulting from rigorously applied scientific procedures," allegedly cutting the notion of "[[artist]]" out of the process of creating images and replacing it with chance and scientific rigour.  However, the question has arisen whether an algorithm should be used to determine in what order to connect the dots to maintain the "automatic" nature of the method.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Matthew Conroy|title=comment on "The Olmec Bride with the Saturated Eyebrows Bemoans the Inconvenience of Love"|url =http://www.ibiblio.org/otis/discussion/static/sito.id.dcb/20050307-11656.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The method has been compared to the "[[voronoi diagram|voronoi mathematical progression]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=entopic graphomania|url=http://dmacwilliam.wordpress.com/2007/11/12/entopic-graphomania/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Étrécissements==
[[Collage]] is perceived as an additive method of visual poetry whereas '''Étrécissements''' are a reductive method. This was first employed by [[Marcel Mariën]] in the 1950s. The results are achieved by the cutting away of parts of images to encourage a new image, by means of a pair of scissors or any other  manipulative sharpened instrument.

==Exquisite corpse==
{{Main|Exquisite corpse}}
'''Exquisite corpse''' or '''Cadavre exquis''' is a method by which a collection of words or images are collectively assembled. It is based on an old parlour game known by the same name (and also as [[Consequences (game)|Consequences]]) in which players wrote in turn on a sheet of paper, folded it to conceal part of the writing, and then passed it to the next player for a further contribution.

==Frottage==
{{Main|Frottage (surrealist technique)}}
'''Frottage''' is a method of creation in which one takes a pencil or other drawing tool and makes a "rubbing" over a textured surface. The drawing can either be left as it is or used as the basis for further refinement.

==Fumage==
{{Main|Fumage}}
'''Fumage''' is a technique in which impressions are made by the [[smoke]] of a [[candle]] or [[kerosene lamp]] on a piece of paper or canvas. This technique was introduced by [[Wolfgang Paalen]].

==Games==
In [[Surrealism]], games are important not only as a form of recreation but as a method of investigation. The intention is to cut away the constraints of [[rationalism]] and allow concepts to develop more freely and in a more random manner. The aim is to break traditional thought patterns and create a more original outcome.

Old games such as [[Exquisite corpse]], and newer ones, notably Time Travelers' Potlatch and Parallel Collage, have played a critical role.

Exquisite corpse is a method by which a collection of words or images are collectively assembled, the result being known as the exquisite corpse or ''cadavre exquis'' in [[French language|French]]. Later the game was adapted to [[drawing]] and [[collage]].

Time Travelers' [[Potlatch]] is a game in which two or more players say what gift they would give to another person - this is usually an historical person who played a role in, or had an influence on, the formation of Surrealism.

==Grattage==&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[Acrylic paint]] --&gt;
'''Grattage''' is a surrealist technique in [[painting]] in which (usually wet) [[paint]] is scraped off the canvas.  It was employed by [[Max Ernst]] and [[Joan Miró]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.diba.cat/c/document_library/get_file?uuid=e1e1ab74-006d-4000-b415-a55e9186b8a1&amp;groupId=336453 "Joan Miró . Galeria d'Antiretrats"]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Heatage==
'''Heatage''' is an automatic technique developed and used by [[David Hare (artist)|David Hare]] in which an exposed but unfixed [[negative (photography)|photographic negative]] is heated from below, causing the [[emulsion]] (and the resulting image, when developed) to distort in a random fashion.

==Indecipherable writing==
In addition to its obvious meaning of writing that is illegibile or for whatever other reason cannot be made out by the reader, '''indecipherable writing''' refers to a set of [[surrealist automatism|automatic]] techniques, most developed by [[Romania]]n surrealists and falling under the heading of [[surautomatism]].  Examples include entoptic graphomania, [[fumage]] and the movement of liquid down a vertical surface.

==Involuntary sculpture==
Surrealism describes as "involuntary sculpture" those made by absent-mindedly manipulating something, such as rolling and unrolling a movie ticket, bending a paper clip, and so forth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Involuntary Sculpture |url=http://www.surrealismcentre.ac.uk/documents/Involuntary%20Sculpture.doc |accessdate=2007-10-25 |deadurl=unfit |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060929124944/http://www.surrealismcentre.ac.uk/documents/Involuntary%20Sculpture.doc |archivedate=September 29, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Latent news==
'''Latent news''' is a game in which an article from a [[newspaper]] is cut into individual words (or perhaps phrases) and then rapidly reassembled; see also [[Cut-up technique]].

==Movement of liquid down a vertical surface==
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[Image:Masked Badlands the Sandstone Erections the Utahian and Delicate Spires Exclaved by Torquemada's Blister Which Is Your Very Special Freckle.jpg|thumb|right|150px|An example of "movement of liquid down a vertical surface"]] --&gt;
The '''movement of liquid down a vertical surface''' is, as the name suggests, a technique, invented by surrealists from [[Romania]] and said by them to be [[surautomatism|surautomatic]] and a form of indecipherable writing, of making pictures by dripping or allowing a flow of some form of liquid down a vertical surface.

==Paranoiac-critical method==
{{Main|Paranoiac-critical method}}
'''Paranoiac-critical method''' is a technique invented by [[Salvador Dalí]] which consists of the artist invoking a paranoid state (fear that the self is being manipulated, targeted or controlled by others). The result is a deconstruction of the psychological concept of identity, such that subjectivity becomes the primary aspect of the artwork.

==Parsemage==&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[Charcoal]] --&gt;
'''Parsemage''' is a [[surrealist]] and [[surrealist automatism|automatic]] method in the [[visual art]]s invented by [[Ithell Colquhoun]] in which dust from [[charcoal]] or colored [[chalk]] is scattered on the surface of water and then skimmed off by passing a stiff paper or cardboard just under the water's surface.

==Photomontage==
{{Main|Photomontage}}
'''Photomontage''' is making of composite picture by cutting and joining a number of photographs.

==Soufflage==
{{Main|Soufflage}}
'''Soufflage''' is a surrealist technique originated by [[Jimmy Ernst]] in which liquid [[paint]] is blown to inspire or reveal an image.

==Surautomatism==
{{Main|Surautomatism}}
'''Surautomatism''' is any theory or act of taking automatism to its most absurd limits.

==Triptography==
'''Triptography''' is an automatic photographic technique whereby a roll of film is used three times (either by the same photographer or, in the spirit of Exquisite Corpse, three different photographers), causing it to be triple-exposed in such a way that the chances of any single photograph having a clear and definite subject is nearly impossible.  Indeed, finding any edges on the negative itself during the developing process is a nearly impossible task.  Typically the developing of such a roll of film is an exercise in automatic technique in and of itself, cutting the film by counting sprocket holes alone, with no regard for the images present on the negative.  The results have a quality reminiscent of the transitory period in sleep when one dream suddenly becomes another.

Creativist Christopher Thurlow claims to have discovered this technique when his urge to continue taking photographs was suddenly challenged by the fact that he had run out of un-exposed film.

'''''The Child's Brain''''' (Italian: ''Il bambino cervello'') is [[oil painting|oil on canvas painting]] by the Italian artist [[Giorgio de Chirico]]. The painting was completed in 1914 in Italy. It is an example of the [[Metaphysical art]] style. The painting measures 81.5 by 65 centimeters and is now housed at [[Moderna museet]], Stockholm.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Le Cerveau de l'enfant |website=Moderna Museet |url=http://sis.modernamuseet.se/en/view/objects/asitem/search$0040swg$0027Giorgio$0020de$0020Chirico$0027$002c$00271914$0027/0?t:state:flow=7ddc0fa5-ebbd-4166-9603-484d0cd41303 |access-date=21 October 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The subject of ''The Child’s Brain'' is a nude young man, seen from the waist up, who is standing in back of a table with his eyes closed.&lt;ref name=Bohn&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Description==
The painting depicts a nude young man with a mix of both masculine and feminine features (the feminine being especially prominent in the lack of body hair or defined musculature, the long eyelashes and the finely groomed eyebrows) standing behind a table which blocks our view of him below the waist.  On the table is a yellow book with a red bookmark, that has been interpreted as an allegorical representation of male/female intercourse.  The man's right arm is hidden from view by a Greek column, connecting this painting to the art of the ancient Greeks, a common theme among de Chirico's work.  The man himself is likely a younger version of the figure of [[Dionysos]] who appears in later works by de Chirico, such as ''The Phantom''.&lt;ref name=Bohn/&gt;

The common interpretation of the painting is that the figure represents de Chirico's father, with the book on the table representing the artists' parent's lovemaking, perhaps witnessed at some point by the young artist.&lt;ref name=Bohn/&gt;

In ''The Child’s Brain'', the man depicted has his pelvic area covered by a book. This can be interpreted as the man being faced with the terror of castration which can be found in the psychological work of Sigmund Freud. De Chirico was in tune with Freud's studies, reflecting a fascination with psychosexual stages, particularly the phallic stage. It is at this time that the male child develops an obsession with his genitals, that leads to the realization of gender difference and a fear of castration.&lt;ref&gt;Stevenson, David B. "Psychosexual Development." Psychosexual Development. Brown University, 1996. Web. 13 Mar. 2013. &lt;http://www.victorianweb.org/science/freud/develop.html&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''The Fall of Man''''', '''''Adam and Eve''''' or '''''Adam and Eve in the earthly paradise''''' is a 1628-1629 painting by [[Rubens]], now in the [[Prado]] in Madrid. Once attributed to the minor Dutch artist [[Karel van Mander]],{{cn|date=October 2018}} it is now recognised as a work by Rubens.

It is a copy of [[The Fall of Man (Titian)|the painting of the same subject]] by [[Titian]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.museodelprado.es/en/the-collection/online-gallery/on-line-gallery/obra/adam-and-eve/ |title=Titian catalogue entry |publisher=Museodelprado.es |date=2009-09-15 |accessdate=2013-08-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; seen by Rubens during his 1628-1629 trip to Madrid for peace negotiations to end the [[Dutch Revolt]]. It reflects [[Raphael]]'s influence on Titian and [[Jan Brueghel the Elder]]'s influence on Rubens, who adds a parrot and changes Adam's posture, musculature, age and expression.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.museodelprado.es/en/the-collection/online-gallery/on-line-gallery/obra/adam-and-eve-1/ |title=Rubens catalogue entry |publisher=Museodelprado.es |date=2009-09-15 |accessdate=2013-08-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''The Gruffalo''''' is a children's book by writer and playwright [[Julia Donaldson]], illustrated by [[Axel Scheffler]], that tells the story of a mouse, the protagonist of the book, taking a walk in a European forest. The book has sold over 13&amp;nbsp;million copies,&lt;ref name=CT28Feb&gt;{{cite news|last1=Marshall|first1=Konrad|title=The Gruffalo author Julia Donaldson reveals where ideas bubble up from|url=http://www.canberratimes.com.au/entertainment/books/the-gruffalo-author-julia-donaldson-reveals-where-ideas-bubble-up-from-20150224-13m0uk.html|accessdate=2 March 2015|work=The Canberra Times|publisher=Fairfax Media Ltd|date=27 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; has won several prizes for children's literature, and has been developed into plays on both the [[West End theatre|West End]] and [[Broadway (Manhattan)|Broadway]] and even an Oscar nominated [[The Gruffalo (film)|animated film]].

''The Gruffalo'' was initially published in 1999 in the United Kingdom by [[Macmillan Publishers|Macmillan]] Children's Books ({{ISBN|0-333-71093-2}}) as a 32-page hardback edition, was followed six months later by a paperback edition, and subsequently by a small-format board book edition. It was penned for readers aged three to seven, and is about 700 words long. It is written in rhyming couplets, featuring repetitive verse with minor variance.

==Plot==
The story of a mouse's walk through the woods unfolds in two phases; in both, the mouse uses clever tricks to evade danger. On his way the mouse encounters several dangerous animals (a fox, an owl, and a snake). Each of these animals, clearly intending to eat the mouse, invites him back to their home for a meal. The cunning mouse declines each offer. To dissuade further advances, he tells each animal that he has plans to dine with his friend, a gruffalo, a monster-like [[Mythological hybrid|hybrid]] that is half grizzly bear and half buffalo, whose favourite food happens to be the relevant animal, and describes the features of the gruffalo's monstrous [[anatomy]]. Frightened that the gruffalo might eat it, each animal flees. Knowing the gruffalo to be fictional, the mouse gloats thus:

: ''Silly old fox/owl/snake, doesn't he know?''
: ''there's no such thing as a gruffalo!''

After getting rid of the last animal, the mouse is shocked to encounter a ''real'' gruffalo – with all the frightening features the mouse thought that he was inventing. The gruffalo threatens to eat the mouse, but again the mouse is cunning: he tells the gruffalo that he, the mouse, is the scariest animal in the forest. Laughing, the gruffalo agrees to follow the mouse as he demonstrates how feared he is. The two walk through the forest, encountering in turn the animals that had earlier menaced the mouse. Each is terrified by the sight of the pair and runs off – and each time the gruffalo becomes more impressed with the mouse's apparent toughness. Exploiting this, the mouse threatens to eat the gruffalo, which flees.

The story is based on a [[Chinese folklore|Chinese folk tale]] of a fox that borrows the terror of a tiger. Donaldson was unable to think of rhymes for "tiger" so instead she invented a word that rhymes with "know".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://books.guardian.co.uk/departments/childrenandteens/story/0,6000,1292836,00.html | location=London | work=The Guardian | first=Robert | last=McCrum | title=Interview: Julia Donaldson | date=29 August 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.juliadonaldson.co.uk/about.htm Information on Julia Donaldson, children's author and creator of The Gruffalo&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Recognition==

The audio version won the Best Children's Audio award in the Spoken Book Awards.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bbc.co.uk/dna/h2g2/A13729746 h2g2 - 'The Gruffalo' and 'The Gruffalo's Child' - Children's Stories&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;  In November 2009 the book was voted "best bedtime story" by listeners of BBC Radio 2.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bbc.co.uk/radio2/shows/jeremy-vine/bedtime-stories/ BBC - Radio 2 - Jeremy Vine - Jeremy Vine's Bedtime Stories&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; In a 2010 survey by UK charity Booktime, the book came first in a list of children's favourite books.&lt;ref name="BBC News"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/education-11568551 |title=Gruffalo tops list of children's favorite books |accessdate=19 October 2010|work=BBC News  |date=18 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Culture===
The Dean Heritage Centre in the [[Forest of Dean]], England was given permission by author Julia Donaldson, illustrator Axel Scheffler and the publisher's Macmillan Children's Books, London, UK, to create the Gruffalo trail within the national park.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Dean Heritage Centre|url=http://www.deanheritagecentre.com/events/gruffalotrail.html|publisher=Dean Heritage Centre|accessdate=5 April 2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6DbgmpLLX?url=http://www.deanheritagecentre.com/events/gruffalotrail.html|archivedate=12 January 2013|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the time that Julia Donaldson lived in [[Bearsden]], Gruffalo sculptures were installed around Kilmardinny Loch using natural materials, such as a [[beech]] tree trunk for the largest one. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.glasgowwithkids.co.uk/kilmardinny-loch-gruffalo-bearsden-glasgow-review/|title=Finding the Gruffalo (in Bearsden…)|last=|first=|date=29 October 2015|website=Glasgow With Kids|access-date=27 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Versions and products==
The book was initially sold as an A4 paperback book in 1999, and later as a smaller A5 board book version in 2002. An [[audiobook]] version, narrated by [[Imelda Staunton]], was released in 2002, and a [[jigsaw puzzle|jigsaw]] book version ({{ISBN|1-4050-3496-3}}) was published in 2004. The book is also sold packaged with a gruffalo [[plush toy|soft toy]]. At some point in the print run of the hardcover paper page book, the dialogue was subtly changed. There are two different ISBN numbers for the book. However, the older ISBN number that relates to the original text is no longer available.{{Citation needed|reason=date June 2009|date=June 2009}}

The "Gruffalo song" was released with the audiobook, as a standalone CD single, and on a musical CD with other songs from Donaldson's books.{{Citation needed|reason=date June 2009|date=June 2009}}

Donaldson and Scheffler's sequel, 2004's ''[[The Gruffalo's Child]]'' (which tells the story of the gruffalo's daughter, warned by her father of the terrifying mouse) won the "Best Children's Book" award in the 2005 [[British Book Awards]].

A Gruffalo Woodland Trail has been created at the [[Dean Heritage Centre]], Soudley in the Forest of Dean, UK. The trail depicts the scenes from the book and has been carved by local chainsaw artists out of local redwood. The trail runs daily throughout 2012.

A ridable wheeled Gruffalo children's suitcase is manufactured for [[Trunki]]; the case had been featured as a pitch idea on the entrepreneur game show ''[[Dragons' Den]]'' and{{Citation needed|date=June 2010}} rejected by the show's judges.

Donaldson and Scheffler have collaborated on many other titles; some feature cameos from the Gruffalo in other guises,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Julia Donaldson &amp; Axel Scheffler Character Cameos|url=http://donaldson-scheffler-character-cameos.blogspot.co.uk/}}&lt;/ref&gt; including as Christmas tree decoration in [[Stick Man]], a drawing by a child in ''[[The Snail and the Whale]]'' and a fish in ''Tiddler''.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7660">'''The Hypocrites''' is a [[Theater in Chicago|Chicago storefront theater company]] founded in 1997 by Sean Graney, Brandon Kruse and Christopher Cintron. The company is currently run by Sean Graney (Artistic Director) and Kelli Strickland (Executive Director). One of [[Chicago]]’s premier off-Loop theater companies, The Hypocrites specializes in mounting bold productions that challenge preconceptions and redefining the role of the audience through unusual staging (such as promenade and in-the-round) and direct engagement. The company has a reputation in Chicago for creating exciting, surprising, and deeply engaging theater as it re-interprets well-known works for contemporary audiences, reveling in the absurd while revealing the core of what makes classics classic.&lt;blockquote&gt;''“The Hypocrites, who with each new production, continue to rise not just to the rank of one of our city’s best storefronts but one of Chicago’s best theaters period.” – Newcity Stage ('''[[American Idiot (musical)|American Idiot]]''', 2015)''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Review: American Idiot/The Hypocrites|url = http://www.newcitystage.com/2015/09/07/review-american-idiotthe-hypocrites/|website = Newcity Stage|accessdate = 2015-12-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;The company has grown significantly in the past few years, receiving acclaim for productions at the [[Steppenwolf Theatre Company|Steppenwolf Garage]], [[Goodman Theatre]], [[Museum of Contemporary Art, Chicago|Museum of Contemporary Art]], DCASE Storefront, Chopin Theater and nationally at American Repertory Theater (A.R.T.), Berkeley Repertory Theatre, and Actors Theatre of Louisville.

== Adaptations ==
Their recent production of Graney’s ''All Our Tragic'', a twelve-hour adaptation combining all 32 surviving Greek Tragedies, garnered the company six 2015 Equity Jeff Awards in its first year of eligibility.&lt;blockquote&gt;“’A watershed moment for off-Loop theater.” – Chris Jones, [[Chicago Tribune]] ('''''All Our Tragic''''', 2014)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = REVIEW: 'All Our Tragic' by The Hypocrites ★★★★|url = http://www.chicagotribune.com/entertainment/theater/reviews/ct-all-our-tragic-review-column.html|website = chicagotribune.com|accessdate = 2015-12-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;Graney’s musical adaptations of [[Gilbert and Sullivan|Gilbert &amp; Sullivan]]’s ''[[The Pirates of Penzance|Pirates of Penzance]]'', ''[[The Mikado]]'' and ''[[H.M.S. Pinafore]]'' have become audience and critic favorites, being remounted numerous times in Chicago as well as going on tour to [[American Repertory Theater|American Repertory Theater (A.R.T.)]], [[Berkeley Repertory Theatre]], [[Actors Theatre of Louisville]], and [[Olney theater|Olney Theater Center]].&lt;blockquote&gt;''“Cromer calibrates 'Our Town' with clear-eyed intelligence. You see the beauties of small-town America and its limitations, laid out before you as directly and powerfully as the Chicago theater can muster.” – Chris Jones, Chicago Tribune ('''Our Town''', 2008)''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = 'Our Town' director David Cromer does this town proud|url = http://articles.chicagotribune.com/2008-05-09/entertainment/0805070688_1_town-steppenwolf-theatre-chicago-theater|website = tribunedigital-chicagotribune|accessdate = 2015-12-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

== Awards ==
Since the company’s founding, The Hypocrites have produced over sixty main stage productions and a dozen festival pieces, securing thirty-one [[Joseph Jefferson Award|Non-Equity Joseph Jefferson]] awards, six Equity Joseph Jefferson awards, and two After Dark Awards.

The [[American Theatre Wing]], best known as the creator of the [[Tony Award]]s, presented The Hypocrites with one of the 2013 National Theatre Company awards. The company's smash-hit production of ''[[Our Town]]'', directed by [[David Cromer]], transferred in 2009 to [[Off-Broadway]], [[Los Angeles]] and [[Boston]].

The Hypocrites began performing in the basement of Café Voltaire, a now defunct vegetarian restaurant in [[Lakeview, Chicago|Lakeview]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.chicagoweekly.org/2007/11/21/what-the-director-saw-onstage-with-the-hypocrites-sean-graney/ |title=What the Director Saw: Onstage with the Hypocrites’ Sean Graney |publisher=The Chicago Weekly |date=2007-11-21 |accessdate=2014-04-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; Co-founder Sean Graney has been the artistic director since early 2015, when he announced his return from a three year hiatus.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | first=Rob | last=Weinert-Kendt | title= The Real Story Behind Sean Graney’s Return to the Hypocrites |work=American Theatre | date=January 29, 2015  | url=http://www.americantheatre.org/2015/01/29/the-real-story-behind-sean-graneys-return-to-the-hypocrites/ | accessdate=November 22, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The company's name is inspired by [[Eugène Ionesco]]’s ''Notes and Counter Notes'', a compendium of interviews on the nature of theatre throughout which Ionesco regularly contradicts himself — hence its title, and The Hypocrites' name.

'''''Thunderstruck''''' is a 2012 [[Family film|family]] [[comedy film]] directed by [[John Whitesell]] and starring [[Taylor Gray]], along with professional [[basketball]] player [[Kevin Durant]], [[Brandon T. Jackson]], [[Doc Shaw]] and [[Jim Belushi]]. It was released on August 24, 2012.&lt;ref name="DurantPremieres" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Release" /&gt;

==Plot==
Brian is a 16-year-old living in [[Oklahoma]]. Though he has tried out for the school basketball team, the Eagles, he has never made it, resigned to being [[water boy]] for the team. While practicing at home, Brian's sister makes a video of him injuring himself. She shows the video around school, and it is eventually seen by Connor, the star player of the basketball team. Brian takes a liking to Isabelle, a new girl at school, but is embarrassed when Connor shows the video of him to the whole school. In order to cheer him up, Brian's dad takes him to a [[Oklahoma City Thunder|Thunder]] game against the [[Detroit Pistons]] at [[Chesapeake Energy Arena]] in [[Oklahoma City]].

At halftime, Brian is chosen to shoot a half-court shot which he misses and hits [[Rumble the Bison|Rumble, the mascot]] in the process. Later on, he meets [[Kevin Durant]] and expresses his desire to play just like him. When Durant signs the special edition Oklahoma City Thunder [[basketball (ball)|basketball]] that Brian got to shoot the half-court shot with, a surge of energy causes Durant's talent to transfer to Brian when he hands it over. The Thunder lose the game, with Durant shooting 0-13 in the 2nd half.

The next morning, Brian learns that Connor, who was at the game, recorded him missing the half-court shot and posted it online. Later that night he goes out to a carnival and sees Connor fail to hit shots to win a prize for the new girl, Isabelle. Connor challenges him to "do better", which Brian is able to do, winning a prize which he then gives to Isabelle. Meanwhile, Durant's performance declines at practices, but insists he's only in a slump.

After making several impressive shots at home, Brian decides to try out for the Eagles again. The coach, impressed by Brian's new skill, has Brian replace Connor as the team captain, and they win several games. Durant's agent learns of Brian and realizes that he is the same kid who missed the half-court shot. He tracks him down and explains that he believes Brian stole Durant's talent. He arranges for Durant and Brian to practice together to try to reverse it, but all attempts fail.

Shortly before the final game, Brian and Isabelle begin fighting about how Brian has changed. Eventually, Brian goes to apologize and, while watching the video of him missing the half-court shot at her house, realizes what has to be done to give Durant his talent back. He rides his bike all the way to Chesapeake Arena and finds Durant. He explains that he hit Rumble before the transfer, and theorized that was what had to happen to reverse it. Brian hits Rumble with exactly the same ball he used to shoot the half-court shot, and then repeats the conversation that he had with Durant at their first meeting. Durant gets his talent back, and the Thunder qualify for the [[NBA Playoffs|playoffs]].

At the final game for the Eagles, Brian is nervous about playing because he no longer has the talent. Though he plays rather poorly, with help from the other team members, including Connor, he still manages to lead his team to a close game and taking the final shot himself, makes the game-winning shot which sends the Eagles to the state playoffs for the first time in 32 years. Brian, who is gradually getting better at basketball, is later seen playing with Durant.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5713">The '''William Hodges Fellowship''' residency programme is the successor to the '''Southland Art Foundation Artist in Residence'''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mch.govt.nz/funding-nz-culture/search-funding?detail=802504/B Ministry for Culture and Heritage - The William Hodges Fellowship]&lt;/ref&gt;

The origins of the William Hodges Fellowship date back to 1981. The Southland Art Foundation Artist In Residence was established in 1996 by a joint partnership between Southland Art Foundation, Creative New Zealand, Southland Museum &amp; Art Gallery and the Southern Institute of Technology.

In 1999 the [[Southland Art Foundation]] Trustees–Shirley Palmer, Gwen Neave, [[Russell Beck]] and [[Wayne P Marriott]] resolved to rename the Artist in Residence programme the [[William Hodges]] Fellowship.{{Citation needed|date=May 2011}} This was in recognition of the acquisition of William Hodges “Maori before a Waterfall”, 1773 by the Southland Museum &amp; Art Gallery in 1998. Hodges was regarded as the first non-Maori artist in residence in Southland, having depicted the flora, fauna and people of the region during Cook’s second voyage to New Zealand.

The inaugural William Hodges Fellowship was awarded to Jo Ogier, printmaker, from Dunedin in 2000.

On Friday 3 November 2000 Burwell House was opened as the residence for the William Hodges Fellow.&lt;ref name="beehive.govt.nz"&gt;[http://www.beehive.govt.nz/speech/opening-burwell-house-artist039s-residence-invercargill beehive.govt.nz - Opening of Burwell House, Artist's Residence, Invercargill]&lt;/ref&gt;

The partnership of [[Southland Museum and Art Gallery]], [[Southland Art Foundation]], [[Southern Institute of Technology]], and [[Creative New Zealand]] has continued to develop the fellowship, providing the opportunity for artists to work financially unencumbered for a period of time, as well as working closely with the local community.&lt;ref name="beehive.govt.nz"/&gt;
