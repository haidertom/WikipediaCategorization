{{Popular music}}

This article includes an overview of the major events and trends in '''[[popular music]] in the [[1970s]]'''.

In [[North America]], [[Europe]], and [[Oceania]], the decade saw the rise of [[disco]], which became one of the biggest genres of the decade, especially in the mid-to-late 1970s.&lt;ref name="allmusic.com"&gt;http://www.allmusic.com/explore/essay/disco-t2151&lt;/ref&gt; In Europe, a variant known as [[Euro disco]]&lt;ref name="allmusic.com"/&gt; rose in popularity towards the end of the 1970s. Aside from disco, [[funk]], [[smooth jazz]], [[jazz fusion]], and [[soul music|soul]] remained popular throughout the decade. It is this influx of popular music that soon transformed into [[rock and roll]] during the Early 1970s. [[Rock music]] played an important part in the Western musical scene, with [[punk rock]] thriving throughout the mid to late 1970s.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.allmusic.com/explore/essay/american-punk-rock-t555&lt;/ref&gt; Other subgenres of rock, particularly [[glam rock]], [[hard rock]], [[progressive rock|progressive]], [[art rock]] and [[heavy metal music|heavy metal]] achieved various amounts of success. Other genres such as [[reggae]] were innovative throughout the decade and grew a significant following.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.allmusic.com/explore/style/contemporary-reggae-d7729&lt;/ref&gt; [[Hip hop music|Hip hop]] emerged during this decade,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.allmusic.com/explore/metastyle/hip-hop-urban-d4483&lt;/ref&gt; but was slow to start and did not become significant until the late 1980s. [[classical music|Classical]] began losing a little momentum; however, through invention and theoretical development, this particular genre gave rise to [[Experimental music|experimental classical]] and [[minimalist music]] by classical composers. A subgenre of classical, [[film score]]s, remained popular with movie-goers. Alongside the popularity of [[experimental music]], the decade was notable for its contributions to [[electronic music]], which rose in popularity with the continued development of [[synthesizer]]s and [[harmonizer]]s; more composers embraced this particular genre, gaining the notice of listeners who were looking for something new and different. Its rising popularity, mixed with the popular music of the period, led to the creation of [[synthpop]]. [[Pop music|Pop]] also had a popularity role in the 1970s.

In [[Asia]], music continued to follow varying trends. In [[Japan]], the decade saw several musical phases, including the highly popular [[frat music|folk]]-influenced ''[[fōku]]'', as well as greater experimentation with [[electronic music]], ranging from developments in [[synthpop]], [[electro (music)|electro]], and [[Electronic Dance Music]], created through different Japanese artists and bands such as [[Yellow Magic Orchestra]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.thewire.co.uk/articles/210/&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Latin America]] and the [[Iberian Peninsula]], the [[Nueva canción]] movement peaked in popularity and was adopted as the music of the [[hippie]], [[Liberation Theology]], and [[New Left]] movements. [[Cumbia]] music began its internationalization as regional scenes rose outside Colombia. [[Merengue music|Merengue]] experienced mainstream exposure across [[Latin America]] and the southern US border states.

In [[Africa]], especially [[Nigeria]], the genre known as [[Afrobeat]] gained a following throughout the 1970s.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.allmusic.com/explore/style/afro-beat-d338&lt;/ref&gt;

== North America ==

===Hard rock, arena rock and heavy metal===

{{Expand section|date=April 2010}}
The 1970s saw the emergence of [[hard rock]] as one of the most prominent subgenres of [[rock music]] with acts such as [[Alice Cooper]], [[Deep Purple]], [[Led Zeppelin]], [[Queen (band)|Queen]], [[Nazareth (band)|Nazareth]], [[Black Sabbath]] and [[Blue Öyster Cult]] were highly popular during the first half of the decade. By the second half of the decade, many other acts had also achieved stardom, namely, [[AC/DC]], [[Kiss (band)|Kiss]], [[Aerosmith]], [[Van Halen]] and [[Ted Nugent]].

[[Arena rock]] grew in popularity through rock acts such as [[Styx (band)|Styx]], [[Heart (band)|Heart]] and [[The Who]].

[[Psychedelic rock]] declined in popularity after the deaths of [[Jimi Hendrix]], [[Janis Joplin]], and [[Jim Morrison]] of [[The Doors]], the self-imposed seclusion of [[Syd Barrett]] from Pink Floyd, and the break-up of [[The Beatles]] in 1970.

=== Country rock and Southern rock ===

[[File:Eagles.jpg|thumb|right|[[Eagles (band)|The Eagles]]]]
[[Country rock]], formed from the fusion of [[rock music]] with [[country music]], gained its greatest commercial success in the 1970s, beginning with non-country artists such as [[Bob Dylan]], [[Gram Parsons]], and [[The Byrds]]. By the mid-1970s, [[Linda Ronstadt]], along with other newer artists such as [[Emmylou Harris]] and [[The Eagles]], were enjoying mainstream success and popularity that continues to this day. The Eagles themselves emerged as one of the most successful rock acts of all time, producing albums that included ''[[Hotel California (Eagles album)|Hotel California]]'' (1976).&lt;ref name=Tawa2005&gt;N. E. Tawa, ''Supremely American: Popular Song in the 20th Century: Styles and Singers and What They Said About America'' (Lanham, MA: Scarecrow Press, 2005), {{ISBN|0-8108-5295-0}}, pp.&amp;nbsp;227–8.&lt;/ref&gt;

During the 1970s, a similar style of country rock called [[southern rock]] (fusing rock, country, and blues music, and focusing on electric guitars and vocals) was enjoying popularity with country audiences, thanks to such non-country acts as [[The Ozark Mountain Daredevils]], [[Lynyrd Skynyrd]], [[The Allman Brothers Band]], and [[The Marshall Tucker Band]].

===Hard/arena rock===

[[File:Styx.JPG|thumb|left|150px|[[Styx (band)|Styx]]]]
The American brand of prog rock varied from the eclectic and innovative [[Frank Zappa]], [[Captain Beefheart]], and [[Blood, Sweat &amp; Tears|Blood, Sweat and Tears]],&lt;ref&gt;N. E. Tawa, ''Supremely American: Popular Song in the 20th Century: Styles and Singers and What They Said About America'' (Lanham, MA: Scarecrow Press, 2005), {{ISBN|0-8108-5295-0}}, pp.&amp;nbsp;249–50.&lt;/ref&gt; to more pop rock oriented bands like [[Boston (band)|Boston]], [[Foreigner (band)|Foreigner]], [[Journey (band)|Journey]], [[Kansas (band)|Kansas]] and [[Styx (band)|Styx]].&lt;ref name=Bogdanov2002Prog&gt;V. Bogdanov, C. Woodstra and S. T. Erlewine, ''All Music Guide to Rock: the Definitive Guide to Rock, Pop, and Soul'' (Milwaukee, WI: Backbeat Books, 3rd edn., 2002), {{ISBN|0-87930-653-X}}, pp.&amp;nbsp;1330–1.&lt;/ref&gt;  These, beside British bands [[Supertramp]] and [[Electric Light Orchestra]], all demonstrated a prog rock influence and while ranking among the most commercially successful acts of the 1970s, ushering in the era of pomp or [[arena rock]], which would last until the costs of complex shows (often with theatrical staging and special effects), would be replaced by more economical [[rock festival]]s as major live venues in the 1990s.

===New wave===

Successful American [[New wave music|new wave]] bands in the late seventies included [[Talking Heads]], [[The Cars]], [[The Knack]], [[The B-52's]], and [[Devo]]. Some of the Canadian new wave groups included [[Rough Trade (band)|Rough Trade]], [[The Payolas]] and [[Martha and the Muffins]]. After the success of British [[synthpop]] acts in the U.S. such as [[Gary Numan]] and [[the Buggles]], a number of American bands also began experimenting with [[synthesizer]]s. In the early 1980s, bands from the United Kingdom became immensely popular in the U.S., and this phenomenon became known as the [[Second British Invasion]] which mainly consisted of British new wave and synthpop acts, therefore broadening the definition of "new wave".

===Punk rock===

[[File:Johnny Ramone.jpg|thumb|160px|right|[[Ramones]]'s lead guitarist [[Johnny Ramone]] performing in Toronto, 1977]]
The mid-1970s saw the rise of [[punk music]] from its [[protopunk]]-[[garage band]] roots in the 1960s and early 1970s. The [[Ramones]], [[Patti Smith]], and [[Blondie (band)|Blondie]] were some of the earliest American Punk rock acts to make it big in both the United Kingdom and the United States. Punk music has also been heavily associated with a certain [[punk fashion]] and absurdist humour which exemplified a genuine suspicion of mainstream culture and values. Blondie quickly lost their punk roots going on to become a pop/ska/reggae band.

A great write up about the days of early punk in Los Angeles, which had a very different scene, vibe and ethos than typical NYC punk, is Under the Big Black Sun by John Doe of the band X.

===Blues rock===

Blues rock remains popular, with [[Eric Clapton]], [[ZZ Top]], and [[George Thorogood]] seeing the greatest success. [[Freddie King]] started moving from straight blues to blues rock since the genre was now mostly popular among white audiences. Stress from nonstop touring resulted in his death at the age of 42 in 1976.

===Soft rock and pop===

Some of the more notable pop/[[soft rock]] groups during the 1970s were the [[Carpenters (band)|Carpenters]], the [[Jackson 5]], [[Seals &amp; Crofts]], [[The Doobie Brothers]], [[Hall &amp; Oates]], [[Bread (band)|Bread]], [[Captain &amp; Tennille]], [[Tony Orlando and Dawn]], [[Bay City Rollers]], and [[The Osmonds]].

Soloists who characterized the pop music of the era included [[Barry Manilow]], [[Andy Gibb]], [[Elvis Presley]], [[Neil Diamond]], [[Paul McCartney]], [[Stevie Wonder]], [[Elton John]], [[Marvin Gaye]], [[Cat Stevens]], [[James Taylor]], [[Eric Clapton]], [[Barry White]], and [[Rod Stewart]].  Female soloists who epitomized the 1970s included [[Linda Ronstadt]], [[Carly Simon]], [[Roberta Flack]], [[Donna Summer]], [[Barbra Streisand]], [[Rita Coolidge]], [[Olivia Newton-John]] and [[Helen Reddy]].

Some of the most popular music acts of the day got their own network television variety shows, which were very popular in the 70s. Acts like [[Sonny &amp; Cher]], [[Glen Campbell]], [[John Denver]], [[Tony Orlando and Dawn]], husband and wife team [[Captain &amp; Tennille]], brother and sister [[Donny &amp; Marie Osmond]].

[[File:Billy Joel - Perth 7 November 2006.jpg|thumb|150px|left|[[Billy Joel]] performing in Perth Western Australia in 2006]]
[[Soft rock]] was prominently featured on many [[Top 40]] and [[contemporary hit radio]] stations throughout the 1970s. Soft rock often used [[acoustic instrument]]s and placed emphasis on [[melody]] and [[harmonies]]. Major soft rock artists of the 1970s included [[Carole King]], [[James Taylor]], [[Billy Joel]], [[Chicago (band)|Chicago]], [[America (band)|America]], the [[Eagles (band)|Eagles]] and [[Fleetwood Mac]], whose ''[[Rumours (album)|Rumours]]'' (1977) was the best-selling album of the decade.&lt;ref&gt;P. Buckley, ''The Rough Guide to Rock'' (London: Rough Guides, 3rd edn., 2003), {{ISBN|1-84353-105-4}}, p. 378.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="M. Curtis, 1987 p. 236"&gt;J. M. Curtis, ''Rock eras: interpretations of music and society, 1954–1984'' (Popular Press, 1987), p. 236.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="P. Buckley, 2003 p. 378"&gt;P. Buckley, ''The Rough Guide to Rock'' (Rough Guides, 3rd edn., 2003), p. 378.&lt;/ref&gt; (See [[#Country|the country music section]] of this article for more about country music that crossed over onto the pop charts.) [[Bob Dylan]]'s 1975–1976 [[Rolling Thunder Revue]] reunited him with a number of folk-rock acts from his early days of performing, most notably [[Joan Baez]], who returned to the charts in 1975 with "[[Diamonds &amp; Rust]]".

Some of the most successful singers and songwriters were: [[Jackson Browne]], [[James Taylor]], [[Jim Croce]], [[John Denver]], [[Neil Diamond]], [[Barry Gibb]], [[Stevie Wonder]], [[Carole King]], [[Elton John]], [[Don McLean]], [[Joni Mitchell]], [[Paul Simon]], [[Kris Kristofferson]], [[Carly Simon]], [[Donna Summer]], [[Gordon Lightfoot]], and [[Harry Chapin]]— some had previously been primarily songwriters but began releasing albums and songs of their own. King's album ''[[Tapestry (Carole King album)|Tapestry]]'' became one of the top-selling albums of the decade, and the song "[[It's Too Late (Carole King song)|It's Too Late]]" became one of the 1970s biggest songs. McLean's 1971 song "[[American Pie (song)|American Pie]]," inspired by [[The Day the Music Died|the death of Buddy Holly]], became one of popular music's [[Songs of the Century|most-recognized songs of the 20th century]], thanks to its abstract and vivid storytelling, which center around "The Day the Music Died" and popular music of the rock era.

The early 1970s marked the departure of [[Diana Ross]] from [[The Supremes]] and the break-up of [[Simon &amp; Garfunkel]] and [[The Beatles]]. All continued hugely successful recording careers throughout the decade. Some of their songs are that among the hits of the early 1970s: Simon &amp; Garfunkel's "[[Bridge Over Troubled Water]]", Simon's solo hit "[[50 Ways to Leave Your Lover]]", The Beatles  "[[Let It Be (song)|Let It Be]]", Paul McCartney's "[[Uncle Albert/Admiral Halsey]]", George Harrison's "[[My Sweet Lord]]", and Ross' "[[Ain't No Mountain High Enough]]" .&lt;ref name="Cue sheet"&gt;"Top Fifty Hits of the 1970s", [[American Top 40]], Watermark Inc. Aired January 5, 1980. [http://charismusicgroup.com/Cue%20Sheets/01-05-80.pdf Cue sheet] retrieved 1-31-2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

Popular British acts were [[The Rolling Stones]], [[Peter Frampton]], [[Gilbert O'Sullivan]], [[Leo Sayer]], [[Queen (band)|Queen]], [[Led Zeppelin]], [[Supertramp]] and [[The Who]]; who's lead singer [[Roger Daltrey]] made a splash in the movie [[Tommy (1975 film)|Tommy]], playing the title role, based on the groups 1969 album of the same name. [[Elton John]], [[Tina Turner]], [[Ann-Margret]], [[Oliver Reed]], [[Jack Nicholson]] and the other band members made up the ensemble cast.

===R&amp;B and urban===
[[File:Stevie_Wonder_1973.JPG|thumb|left|200px|[[Stevie Wonder]] became one of the most popular R&amp;B artists during the 1970s.]]
[[File:The Jacksons 1977.JPG|thumb|right|200px|[[The Jackson 5]] in 1977.]]
Along with disco, [[funk]] was one of the most popular genres of music in the 1970s. Primarily an African-American genre, it was characterized by the heavy use of bass and "wah-wah" pedals. Rhythm was emphasized over melody. Artists such as [[James Brown]], [[The Meters]], [[Parliament-Funkadelic]] and [[Sly and the Family Stone]] pioneered the genre. It then spawned artists such as [[Stevie Wonder]], [[Rufus (band)|Rufus]], [[The Brothers Johnson]], [[Kool &amp; The Gang]], [[Earth, Wind &amp; Fire]], [[Bootsy's Rubber Band]], [[King Floyd]], [[Tower of Power]], [[Ohio Players]], [[The Commodores]], [[War (band)|War]], [[Confunkshun]], [[Gap Band]], [[Slave (band)|Slave]], [[Cameo (band)|Cameo]], the [[Bar-Kays]], [[Zapp (band)|Zapp]], and many more. Other popular artists with the mainstream were [[Bill Withers]], [[Gladys Knight &amp; the Pips]], [[Three Dog Night]], [[The Stylistics]], [[The Fifth Dimension]], [[Marvin Gaye]], [[The Temptations]], [[The O'Jays]], [[Barry White]] and [[Issac Hayes]].

The 1970s saw African-American audiences shift away from genres like rock and blues which had originally been invented and dominated by black musicians. While blues performers like [[B.B. King]] and [[Albert King]] remained successful, they changed to a mostly white audience. Soul, R&amp;B, and funk became the predominate music styles among black artists and audiences.

[[Roberta Flack]] had two of the biggest hits of the decade with "[[The First Time Ever I Saw Your Face]]", from the Clint Eastwood movie ''[[Play Misty for Me]]''; and "[[Killing Me Softly with His Song|Killing Me Softly]]". Both were # 1 hits on the pop charts and she became the first artist and the only female artist to win back to back [[Grammy Award]]s for Record of the Year.&lt;ref&gt;http://thedropfm/roberta-flack-wins-record-of-the-year-grammy-two-years-in-a-row-black-history-month/.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Stevie Wonder]] who topped the charts five times during the decade with songs such as "[[You Are the Sunshine of My Life]]" and "[[Sir Duke]]" had a unique treble. He won Grammy Awards for both best male Pop and R &amp; B vocal performance in 1974, 1975, and 1977.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.cnn.com/2103/06/07/us/stevie-wonder-fast-facts/index.html.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[The Jackson 5]] became one of the biggest pop-music phenomena of the 1970s,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url={{Allmusic|class=artist|id=p4568|pure_url=yes}} |title=The Jackson 5|last=Huey|first=Steve|publisher=Macrovision Corp.|accessdate=2008-05-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; playing from a repertoire of [[rhythm and blues]], [[pop music|pop]] and later [[disco]]. The Jacksons — brothers [[Jackie Jackson|Jackie]], [[Tito Jackson|Tito]], [[Jermaine Jackson|Jermaine]], [[Marlon Jackson|Marlon]]  and [[Michael Jackson|Michael]] — the first act in recording history to have their first four major label singles: "[[I Want You Back]]", "[[ABC (song)|ABC]]", "[[The Love You Save]]", and "[[I'll Be There (The Jackson 5 song)|I'll Be There]]" reach the top of the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]]. The band served as the launching pad for the solo careers of their lead singers Jermaine and Michael, both had some solo success in the early part of the decade. Jermaine with top 10 hit "[[Daddy's Home (song)|Daddy's Home]]"&lt;ref&gt;http://www.allmusic.com/song/daddys-home-mt0008476579.&lt;/ref&gt; and Michael topped the charts with "[[Ben (song)|Ben]]" theme song to the movie. Other family acts included [[Gladys Knight &amp; the Pips]] who topped the charts with "[[Midnight Train to Georgia]]", [[Sly &amp; the Family Stone]] who brought "[[Thank You (Falettinme Be Mice Elf Agin)]]" and "[[Family Affair (Sly and the Family Stone song)|Family Affair]]" to the top spot. As well as [[The Staple Singers]] with "[[I'll Take You There]]" and "[[Let's Do It Again (song)|Let's Do It Again]]" theme song to a 1975 [[Sidney Poitier]]/[[Bill Cosby]] movie. [[The Sylvers]] with "[[Boogie Fever]]" and [[The Emotions]] with "[[Best of My Love (The Emotions song)|Best of My Love]]".

The Emotions were a girl group which were still popular in soul music, [[Honey Cone]] had a chart topping hit with "[[Want Ads]]", as did [[Labelle]] with "[[Lady Marmalade]]" and [[A Taste of Honey (band)|A Taste of Honey]] with "[[Boogie Oogie Oogie]]". Other examples of the girl group were [[Love Unlimited]] and [[The Three Degrees]] who scored a number two pop hit with "[[When Will I See You Again]]" but topped the chart when they teamed with Mother, Sister, Father, Brother (MSFB) on the Sound of Philadelphia (TSOP).&lt;ref&gt;http://www.allmusic.com/album/great-r-b-female-groups-in-the-70smw0000039791.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Commodores were another group that played from a diverse repertoire, including R&amp;B, funk, and pop. [[Lionel Richie]], who went on to even greater success as a solo artist in the 1980s, fronted the group's biggest 1970s hits, including "[[Easy (Commodores song)|Easy]]", "[[Three Times a Lady]]", and "[[Still (Commodores song)|Still]]".

===Country===

A number of styles defined country music during the 1970s decade. At the beginning of the decade, the [[Nashville sound|countrypolitan]] — an offshoot of the earlier "Nashville Sound" of the late 1950s and early 1960s — and the honky-tonk fused [[Bakersfield Sound]] were some of the more popular styles.

The countrypolitan sound — a polished, streamlined sound featuring string sections, background vocals and crooning lead vocalists — was popularized by artists including [[Lynn Anderson]], [[Glen Campbell]], [[Anne Murray]], [[Dottie West]], [[Tammy Wynette]] and others, achieving their successes through such songs as "[[Rose Garden (Lynn Anderson song)|(I Never Promised You a) Rose Garden]]", "[[Snowbird (song)|Snowbird]]", and others. The Bakersfield sound, first popularized in the early 1960s, continued its peak in popularity through artists such as [[Buck Owens]] and [[Merle Haggard]].

But other styles began to emerge during the 1970s. One of the more successful styles was "[[outlaw country]]", a type of music blending the traditional and honky tonk sounds of country music with [[rock music|rock]] and [[blues|blues music]], and mixed with the anger of an alienated subculture of the nation during the period. The leaders of the movement were [[Waylon Jennings]] and [[Willie Nelson]], although others associated with the movement were [[Jerry Jeff Walker]], [[David Allan Coe]], [[Jessi Colter]], [[Tompall Glaser]], [[Gary Stewart (singer)|Gary Stewart]] and [[Billy Joe Shaver]]. The efforts of Jennings, Nelson, Colter and Glaser were encapsulated in the 1976 album ''[[Wanted! The Outlaws]]''.

Although country gospel was never really the in thing in music. The 1970s saw the rise of "the most awarded act in the history of country music."  That group being [[The Statler Brothers]], who literally dominated country music the entire decade.

The [[country pop]] sound was a successor to the countrypolitan sound of the early 1970s. In addition to artists such as Murray and Campbell, several artists who were not initially marketed as country were enjoying crossover success with country audiences through radio airplay and sales. The most successful of these artists included [[The Bellamy Brothers]], [[Charlie Rich]], [[John Denver]], [[Olivia Newton-John]], [[Marie Osmond]], [[B. J. Thomas]] and [[Kenny Rogers]]. Newton-John, an Australian pop singer, was named Female Vocalist of the Year by the [[Country Music Association]] in 1974, sparking a debate that continues to this day — what is country music? A group of traditional-minded artists, troubled by this trend, formed the short-lived [[Association of Country Entertainers]], in an attempt to bring back traditional honky-tonk sounds to the forefront, setting the stage for the [[neotraditional country]] revival that would become particularly prominent in the early 1980s. The debate continued into 1975, a year where six songs reached No. 1 on both the [[Hot Country Songs|''Billboard'' Hot Country Singles]] and [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] charts. Things came to a head when, at that year's CMA Awards, Rich — the reigning Entertainer of the Year, and himself a crossover artist — presented the award to his successor, "my good friend, Mr. John Denver." His statement, taken as sarcasm, and his setting fire to the envelope (containing Denver's name) with a cigarette lighter were taken as a protest against the increasing pop style in country music (this despite Rich himself having made his name with songs that crossed over from country into the pop and adult contemporary charts).

By the later half of the 1970s, [[Dolly Parton]], a highly successful traditional-minded country artist since the late 1960s, mounted a high-profile campaign to crossover to pop music, culminating in her 1977 hit "[[Here You Come Again (song)|Here You Come Again]]", which peaked at No. 1 country and No. 3 pop. Of her 25 career No. 1 hits, 11 of them came during the 1970s. Parton, also became the female country music artist to host her own variety show, ''[[Dolly!]],'' which aired during the 1976-77 season. Rogers, the former lead singer of [[The First Edition (band)|The First Edition]], followed up a successful career in pop, rock and folk music by switching to country music. Like Parton, whom he would record with in the 1980s and thereafter, Rogers enjoyed a long series of successful songs that charted on both the Hot Country Singles and Billboard Hot 100 charts; the first of the lot was "[[Lucille (Kenny Rogers song)|Lucille]]," a No. 1 country and No. 5 pop hit. [[Crystal Gayle]], [[Ronnie Milsap]], [[Eddie Rabbitt]], and [[Linda Ronstadt]] were some of the other artists who also found success on both the country and pop charts with their records as well.

The most successful of the female artist in the 1970s was [[Loretta Lynn]], releasing her best selling album ''[[Coal Miner's Daughter (album)|Coal Miner's Daughter]]'' in 1970. She gained a total of seven number one albums, and 20 number one hit singles including her biggest hit single, 1970s "Coal Miner's Daughter," which went on to sell more than 500,000 copies to date. Several of Lynn's siblings gained national recording contracts, and it was her youngest sister, Crystal Gayle (born Brenda Gail Webb), who would become by far the most successful. Although she has recorded and/or performed traditional country, Gayle's primary style was country pop, and by forging her own path rather than mimicking her famous sister's style, she had several tremendously successful songs, most notably "[[Don't It Make My Brown Eyes Blue]]." Lynn also recorded with [[Conway Twitty]] multiple times during the 1970s, and had five No. 1 singles together, including "[[After the Fire Is Gone]]." Like Lynn, Twitty had family—in this case, his children—who also recorded and had songs make the top 40 of the Billboard country chart, but none of them had sustained, long-term success.

Besides Lynn-Twitty duet pairing, there were other notable duet pairings during the 1970s, including [[George Jones]] and [[Tammy Wynette]]. Married in 1968, the two had their first duet hit together in 1972 with "Take Me" (a remake of Jones' 1965 solo hit), and went on to have three No. 1 hits together. The two went through an acrimonious divorce in 1975, due in part to Jones' increasingly erratic behavior worsened by substance abuse problems, but the two did continue recording together afterward, releasing their most successful hit, the ironic "[[Golden Ring]]" (a song about how a wedding ring is meaningless without true love) in 1976. As a solo artist, Jones continued to maintain his hold as the premiere honky-tonk artist of the genre, recording songs of broken relationships ("[[The Grand Tour (song)|The Grand Tour]]," "[[The Door (George Jones song)|The Door]]" and "[[Her Name Is]]") and bitterness ("These Days I Barely Get By"), but the aforementioned substance abuse and behavioral issues restrained his own success and by the end of the decade, his life was wildly out of control.

The 1970s continued a trend toward a proliferation of No. 1 hits on the ''Billboard'' Hot Country Singles chart. In 1970, there were 23 songs that reached the top spot on the chart, but by the mid-1970s, more than 40 titles rotated in and out of the top spot for the first time in history. The trend temporarily reversed itself by the late 1970s, when about 30 to 35 songs reached the pinnacle position of the chart annually.

The decade saw the deaths of several country music performers, many who would come to be regarded as [[classic country|classic stars]] of the genre. The year 1975 was a particularly difficult year for the genre, as three key performers -- [[Bob Wills]], [[George Morgan (singer)|George Morgan]] and [[Lefty Frizzell]]—all died within a two-month timespan. In 1977, [[Elvis Presley]] and [[Bing Crosby]], two performers not directly identified as country but were vastly influential in and/or had substantial successes and fanbases in the genre, died within six weeks of each other. Within a seven-month time span from October 1978 to May 1979, four other notable performers died: [[Mel Street]], a relative newcomer whose honky tonk stylings made him one of the decade's most promising new artists; [[Maybelle Carter|"Mother" Maybelle]] and [[Sara Carter]], of the pioneering [[Carter Family]]; and [[Lester Flatt]], an early bluegrass pioneer who formed a successful partnership with [[Earl Scruggs]].

===Other developments===
The decade saw commercial success for [[blue-eyed soul]] artists, such as [[David Bowie]] who released the successful albums [[Young Americans (album)|Young Americans]] (1975), which included the number one hit "[[Fame (David Bowie song)|Fame]]", and [[Station to Station]] (1976).

In the second half of the decade, a 1950s nostalgia movement prompted the [[Rockabilly#Revival|Rockabilly Revival]] fad. [[The Stray Cats]] led the revival into the early 1980s. [[Queen (band)|Queen]] participated through their hit "[[Crazy Little Thing Called Love]]". Also symbolizing this trend was the hit movie ''[[Grease (film)|Grease]]'' in 1978, starring [[John Travolta]] and [[Olivia Newton-John]].

Tying in with the nostalgia craze, several stars of the late 1950s and early 1960s successfully revived their careers during the early- to mid-1970s after several years of inactivity. The most successful of these were [[Ricky Nelson]] ("[[Garden Party (Rick Nelson song)|Garden Party]]", 1972), [[Paul Anka]] ("[[(You're) Having My Baby]]", 1974), [[Neil Sedaka]] ("[[Laughter in the Rain]]" and "[[Bad Blood (Neil Sedaka song)|Bad Blood]]", both 1975), and [[Frankie Valli]] as both a solo artist (1975's "[[My Eyes Adored You]]") and with [[The Four Seasons (band)|The Four Seasons]] (1976's "[[December 1963 (Oh, What A Night)]]"). In addition, [[Perry Como]]—one of the most successful pre-rock era artists—enjoyed continued success, albeit on a somewhat smaller scale (as most of his fans were adults who grew up during the 1940s and early 1950s, and not the rock record-buying youth); his most successful hits of the decade were "[[Somos Novios (It's Impossible)|It's Impossible]]" (1970) and the Don McLean song "[[And I Love Her So]]" (1973).

Two of popular music's most successful artists died within eight weeks of each other in 1977. [[Elvis Presley]], the best-selling singer of all time, died on August 16, 1977.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.time.com/time/nation/article/0,8599,337778,00.html | work=Time | first=Jessica | last=Reaves | title=Person of the Week: Elvis Presley | date=15 August 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt; Presley's funeral was held at [[Graceland]], on Thursday, August 18, 1977.

[[Bing Crosby]], who sold about half a billion records, died October 14, 1977. His single, [[White Christmas (song)|White Christmas]], remains as the best selling single of all time, confirmed by the [[Guinness Records]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://img299.imageshack.us/img299/3315/guinness2007.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-10-05 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150319072130/http://img299.imageshack.us/img299/3315/guinness2007.pdf |archivedate=2015-03-19 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The early seventies also marked the deaths of rock legends [[Jim Morrison]], [[Janis Joplin]], [[Jimi Hendrix]], gospel great [[Mahalia Jackson]] and [[Cass Elliot]] of the Mamas and the Papas. The decade also saw the [[1977 Convair 240 crash|plane crash in 1977]] in which three members of [[Lynyrd Skynyrd]] were killed.

One of the first events of the 1970s was the break-up of [[The Beatles]] in the spring of 1970. [[Paul McCartney]] formed a new group, [[Wings (band)|Wings]], and continued to enjoy great mainstream success. The three other former Beatles — [[John Lennon]], [[George Harrison]] and [[Ringo Starr]] — all continued hugely successful recording careers throughout the decade and beyond. Lennon, McCartney, and Harrison all released extremely successful solo albums in 1970, ''[[Imagine (John Lennon album)|Imagine]]'', ''[[McCartney (album)|McCartney]]'', and ''[[All Things Must Pass (album)|All Things Must Pass]]'', and several of their songs are listed among the biggest hits of the 1970s: Wings' "[[Silly Love Songs]]" and "[[My Love (Paul McCartney &amp; Wings song)|My Love]]," and Harrison's "[[My Sweet Lord]]"."&lt;ref name="Cue sheet"/&gt;

[[Heavy metal music]] gained a cult following in the 1970s, led by [[Led Zeppelin]], [[Black Sabbath]], and [[Deep Purple]], with their styles later influencing other bands like [[Judas Priest]] and [[Motörhead]], which eventually started the [[New Wave of British Heavy Metal]] in the 1980s.

Black Sabbath, formed in 1968 (as The Polka Tulk Blues Band, then Earth), is often credited with inventing the metal genre as well as [[stoner rock]], [[doom metal]], as well as sparking a revolution with much darker lyrics than were the norm in rock at that time.

====Progressive rock====

Progressive or prog rock developed out of late 1960s [[blues-rock]] and [[psychedelic rock]]. Dominated by British bands, it was part of an attempt to elevate rock music to new levels of artistic credibility.&lt;ref name = "AllMusic1"&gt;{{cite web|url={{Allmusic|class=explore|id=style/d374|pure_url=yes}} |title=Prog-Rock/Art Rock |accessdate=2007-12-04 |year=2007 |work=AllMusic |publisher=AllMusic }}&lt;/ref&gt; Progressive rock bands attempted to push the technical and compositional boundaries of rock by going beyond the standard verse-[[refrain|chorus]]-based [[song structure (popular music)|song structure]]s. The [[arrangement]]s often incorporated elements drawn from [[classical music|classical]], [[jazz]], and [[world music]]. [[Instrumental]]s were common, while songs with lyrics were sometimes conceptual, abstract, or based in fantasy. Progressive rock bands sometimes used "[[concept album]]s that made unified statements, usually telling an epic story or tackling a grand overarching theme."&lt;ref name="AllMusic1"/&gt; [[King Crimson]] as well as the [[Moody Blues]] have been seen as the bands who established the concept of "progressive rock". The term was applied to the music of bands such as [[Yes (band)|Yes]], [[Genesis (band)|Genesis]], [[Pink Floyd]], [[Jethro Tull (band)|Jethro Tull]], [[Rush (band)|Rush]], and [[Emerson, Lake &amp; Palmer]].&lt;ref name = "AllMusic1"/&gt; It reached its peak of popularity in the mid-1970s, but had mixed critical acclaim and the punk movement can be seen as a reaction against its musicality and perceived pomposity. Nevertheless, Pink Floyd's 1973 release, ''[[The Dark Side of the Moon]]'', was an immediate success, remaining in the charts for 741 weeks from 1973 to 1988, with an estimated 50 million copies sold. It is Pink Floyd's most commercially successful album and one of the best-selling albums worldwide. It has twice been remastered and re-released, and has been covered in its entirety by several other acts. It spawned two singles, "[[Money (Pink Floyd song)|Money]]" and "[[Time (Pink Floyd song)|Time]]". In addition to its commercial success, ''The Dark Side of the Moon'' is one of Pink Floyd's most popular albums among fans and critics, and is frequently ranked as one of the greatest rock albums of all time.

Glam or glitter rock developed in the UK in the post-[[hippie]] early 1970s. It was characterized by outrageous clothes, makeup, hairstyles, and platform-soled boots.&lt;ref name=Encarta&gt;{{ cite web|work=[[Encarta]] |url=http://encarta.msn.com/dictionary_561509274/glam_rock.html |title=Glam Rock |accessdate=2008-12-21 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5kwQOxDVM?url=http://encarta.msn.com/dictionary_561509274/glam_rock.html |archivedate=2009-10-31 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The flamboyant lyrics, costumes, and visual styles of glam performers were a [[camp (style)|campy]], playing with categories of sexuality in a theatrical blend of [[nostalgia|nostalgic]] references to [[science fiction]] and old movies, all over a guitar-driven [[hard rock]] sound.&lt;ref name=AllmusicGR/&gt; Pioneers of the genre included [[David Bowie]], [[Roxy Music]], [[Mott the Hoople]], [[Marc Bolan]], and [[T.Rex (band)|T.Rex]].&lt;ref name=AllmusicGR/&gt; These, and many other acts straddled the divide between pop and rock music, managing to maintain a level of respectability with rock audiences, while enjoying success in the singles chart, including [[Queen (band)|Queen]] and [[Elton John]].

Largely confined to the [[United Kingdom|British]], glam rock peaked during the mid-1970s, before it disappeared in the face of [[punk rock]] and [[New wave music|new wave]] trends.&lt;ref name=AllmusicGR&gt;"Glam rock", ''All music guides'', {{Allmusic|class=explore|id=style/d388|pure_url=yes}} retrieved 26 June 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

From the late 1960s it became common to divide mainstream rock music into [[soft rock]] and [[hard rock]]. Soft rock was often derived from [[folk rock]], using acoustic instruments and putting more emphasis on melody and harmonies.&lt;ref name="M. Curtis, 1987 p. 236"/&gt; It reached its commercial peak in the mid- to late-1970s with acts like the reformed [[Fleetwood Mac]], whose ''[[Rumours (album)|Rumours]]'' (1977) was the best-selling album of the decade.&lt;ref name="P. Buckley, 2003 p. 378"/&gt; Major British soft rock artists of the 1970s included [[10cc]], [[Mungo Jerry]], [[the Hollies]] and [[Rod Stewart]].

====New wave====
In the late 1970s, many bands in the United Kingdom began experimenting with synthesizers, forming the [[New wave music|new wave]] style known as [[synthpop]]. Major synthpop bands around this time included [[Gary Numan]] and [[Tubeway Army]], [[the Buggles]], [[the Human League]], and [[Orchestral Manoeuvres in the Dark]]. Other successful British new wave bands in the late 1970s included [[the Police]], [[Echo &amp; the Bunnymen]], [[Adam and the Ants]], [[Roxy Music]], [[Squeeze (band)|Squeeze]], [[XTC]], [[the Cure]], [[the Stranglers]], [[Joy Division]] and [[Siouxsie and the Banshees]].

====Punk rock====
The mid-1970s saw the rise of [[punk music]] from its [[protopunk]]-[[garage band]] roots in the 1960s and early 1970s. The [[Sex Pistols]], and [[The Clash]] were some of the earliest British acts to make it big in both the United Kingdom and the United States. Groups like the Clash were noted for the experimentation of style, especially that of having strong [[ska]] influences in their music. Punk music has also been heavily associated with a certain [[punk fashion]] and absurdist humour which exemplified a genuine suspicion of mainstream culture and values. The [[Sex Pistols]] caused a major sensation in 1977 and were the first serious challenge to the established rock groups like the Rolling Stones and Led Zeppelin, although the punk era in Britain lasted only three years and effectively ended with the Pistols' breakup.

[[File:ACDC-Hughes-long ago.jpg|thumb|150px|right|[[AC/DC]], August 1979]]
The mid-to-late 1970s Australian band [[AC/DC]] became one of the most popular and successful acts in Australia, scoring a string of hits, albums and singles. They made their international debut in 1976 with High Voltage. The band quickly became successful outside their home country; the ''[[Highway to Hell]]'' album from 1979 peaked at number 13 on the [[Kent Music Report]] Albums Chart and they would continue as one of the most popular rock groups in the world through the following decade.

[[The Bee Gees]] were an English-Australian group which consisted of brothers [[Barry Gibb|Barry]], [[Maurice Gibb|Maurice]], and [[Robin Gibb]] — was a successful harmonic act as the 1970s dawned. Aside from the chart-topping ''How Can You Mend a Broken Heart'' in 1971, the brothers did not make much impact in the US during the first half of the decade and most of their record sales were in Europe, especially on the continent. With the failure of their 1973 album ''[[Life in a Tin Can]]'', the Bee Gees appeared washed up. But in 1975, they rebounded with ''[[Main Course (album)|Main Course]]'' which added more of a beat to their songs and they began embracing the new disco sound in their next album ''[[Children Of The World]]'' (1976). The musical movie ''Saturday Night Fever'' (1977) finally propelled the Bee Gees to global superstar status with ''[[Stayin' Alive]]'', ''[[More Than a Woman (Bee Gees song)|More Than a Woman]]'' and ''[[Night Fever]]'' (from the [[Saturday Night Fever]] soundtrack). The Gibbs' youngest brother, [[Andy Gibb|Andy]], was a sensation with his own solo career. He made occasional appearances with his brothers and hit the jackpot with his songs ''[[I Just Want to Be Your Everything]]'' and ''[[Shadow Dancing (song)|Shadow Dancing]]''.

The most successful Australian female artist of the decade, [[Olivia Newton-John]], became a leading singer in the 1970s in both the [[popular music|popular]] and [[country music|country]] genres and realized several number one hits, including the songs, ''[[Let Me Be There]]'' and ''[[I Honestly Love You]]'' for which she received three [[Grammy Award|Grammys]].

Additional top music acts in [[Australia]] and [[New Zealand]] included: [[Little River Band]], [[Sherbet (band)|Sherbet]], [[Skyhooks (band)|Skyhooks]], [[John Paul Young]], [[Marcia Hines]], [[Jon English]], [[Richard Clapton]], [[Dragon (band)|Dragon]], [[Hush (band)|Hush]] and the [[Ted Mulry Gang]].

==Latin America, Caribbean and Africa==

===Reggae and AfroBeat===
[[File:Bob-Marley-in-Concert Zurich 05-30-80.jpg|right|200px|thumb|[[Bob Marley]], 1980]]
[[The Wailers (1963-1974 band)|The Wailers]], a band started by [[Bob Marley]], [[Peter Tosh]] and [[Bunny Wailer]] in 1963 which used to play [[ska]] and [[rocksteady]] music during the 1960s, became popular in the [[Caribbean]], Europe and Africa since the early 1970s after they started playing [[reggae]] music. Later on, the band became very popular in the U.S. The Wailers broke up in 1974 with each of the three main members going on to pursue solo careers. Despite the break-up, Marley continued recording music under the name Bob Marley &amp; The Wailers. In 1975, Marley had his international breakthrough with his first hit outside Jamaica, "[[No Woman, No Cry]]", from the ''[[Natty Dread]]'' album. The success of the album ''[[Exodus (Bob Marley &amp; The Wailers album)|Exodus]]'' (1977), which included the major international hits "[[Jamming (song)|Jamming]]", "[[Turn Your Lights Down Low]]", and "[[One Love (Bob Marley song)|One Love]]", propelled Marley to international stardom.

In addition to the Wailers, other significant pioneers include [[Prince Buster]], [[Desmond Dekker]], [[Jackie Mittoo]], and several others.

[[Fela Kuti|Fela Anikulapo Kuti]], or simply Fela, was a Nigerian human rights activist, political maverick, multi-instrumentalist, musician and pioneer of the [[Afrobeat]] music genre. He has been called "superstar, singer, musician, Panafricanist, polygamist, mystic, legend." During the height of his popularity, he was often hailed as one of Africa's most "challenging and charismatic music performers."{{citation needed|date=August 2018}}

===Nueva canción===

During the 1970s in [[Latin America]], the 1960s music influence remained strong and two styles developed from it one that followed the European and North American trends and [[Nueva Canción]] that focused on the renewal of [[folklore]] including [[Andean music]] and [[cueca]]. Some bands such as [[Los Jaivas]] from Chile mixed both streams and created a syncretism between folklore and [[progressive rock]]. The Nueva Canción movement got an even more marked protest association after all countries in the [[Southern Cone]] became (or were already) military dictatorships in the 1970s. In Chile, the Nueva canción styles developed through the 1970s would remain popular until the [[Chilean transition to democracy|return to democracy]] in 1990.

===Rock===
In the 1970s, [[rock en Español]] began to emerge (especially in Argentina), and as imitation bands became fewer, rock music started to develop more independently from the outside, although many rock bands still preferred to sing in English. The Argentine defeat in the [[Falklands War]] in 1982 followed by the fall of the military junta that year diminished need of Nueva Canción as protest music there in favour of other styles.

===Cumbia===
It was during the 1970s the [[cumbia]] became widely popular outside Colombia. Several bands brought Cumbia to Mexico, Peru, Argentina and Chile places that later became major scenes for further developments of cumbia music. While Nueva Canción was the music of the [[New Left]] and the rock developments of Argentina reflected the European oriented youth, cumbia became widely popular among the large poor sectors of Latin American countries, to such degree that it came to be associated with shantytowns and low-prestige Native American populations.

===Salsa and merengue===
[[Salsa music]] developed in the 1960s and 1970s by Puerto Rican and [[Cuba]]n immigrants to the [[New York City]] area but did not enter into mainstream popularity in Latin America until the late 1980s. The [[merengue music]] experienced during the late 1970s was a golden age of productivity characterized by the rise of a new generation of musicians.

==Other trends==
The commercial cinemas around the world tended to imitate nuances of disco beats in their movies to present their movies as western and upbeat. These included the increasingly popular [[kung-fu]] movies in far [[East Asia]] and [[Bollywood]] movies from India.

An '''after action report''' (or '''AAR''') is any form of [[retrospective]] analysis on a given sequence of goal-oriented actions previously undertaken, generally by the author themselves.

The two principal forms of AARs are the [[literary]] AAR, intended for recreational use, and the analytical AAR, exercised as part of a process of [[performance evaluation]] and improvement. In most cases, AARs are a combination of both. Most analytical AARs are conducted over a contemporary problem or situation that has occurred in the past, is happening right now, or what could happen in the future.

== History ==
The first AARs were developed by [[army generals]]. One of the first and best examples of an AAR is [[Julius Caesar]]’s “[[Commentaries on the Gallic War]]”.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Maurer|first1=Rick|title=Feedback toolkit : 16 tools for better communication in the workplace|date=2011|publisher=Productivity Press|location=New York|isbn=1439840938|edition=2nd|url=https://books.google.com/?id=x_vgdUxhj5oC&amp;lpg=PT57&amp;dq=%22after%20action%20report%22%20%22Commentaries%20on%20the%20Gallic%20War%22&amp;pg=PT57#v=onepage&amp;q=%22after%20action%20report%22%20%22Commentaries%20on%20the%20Gallic%20War%22&amp;f=false|accessdate=24 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Contemporary examples of AARs include project evaluations in [[business]], as well as summaries of large gaming sessions in [[videogame]] culture.

== Literary AARS ==
Literary AARs can be formal or informal documents that seek syntax and linguistic improvement. Many [[research papers]] published under an academic journal can be considered a literary AAR. There might not be much of a difference between literary AARs and analytical AARs in terms of research papers, but the key difference is analytical seeks to improve performance while literary seeks to improve style.

== Analytical AARs ==
Analytical AARs are formal [[documents]] intended to serve as aids to performance evaluation and improvement, by registering situation–response interactions, analyzing critical procedures, determining their effectiveness and efficiency, and proposing adjustments and recommendations. 

=== Objectives ===
Analytical AARs have three central objectives:

* Identifying problematic issues and needs for improvement
* Proposing measures to counteract problematic elements
* Obtaining “lessons learned”

=== Structure ===
#Overview
#Goals and objectives
#Analysis of outcomes
#Analysis of the performance shown on critical tasks
#Summary
#Recommendations

=== Examples ===
* The U.S. Army has adopted the After Action Review (AAR) as the primary method for delivering feedback after unit training exercises. Likewise, the U.S. Army Research Institute (ARI) has supported the development and implementation of AAR procedures for over 20 years. The After Action Review Process is critical to forming an After Action Report. Notes from the review often find themselves in the report. &lt;ref&gt;Morrison, J. E., &amp; Meliza, L. L. (1999). Foundations of the after action review process, 81.&lt;/ref&gt;
* Another example of an After Action Report is the global status reported on [[road safety]]. Studies are conducted in order to determine how severe road safety concerns are in a particular area. After this, a report is created over the conditional event that is road safety, and a reflection is written with insight into how road safety can be improved.&lt;ref&gt;Disability, W. H. O. D. of V. and I. P. and, Prevention, W. H. O. V. and I., &amp; Organization, W. H. (2009). Global status report on road safety: Time for action. World Health Organization, 1-227.&lt;/ref&gt;
* Exercise reports are a form of analytical AARs and could be peer-reviewed by an expert who might make suggestions to one's workout routine. Exercise reports find themselves following the same structure as a general AAR. A draft report can be written before workouts, and a follow-up report could be written afterward detailing steps the user could act upon in order to improve their work ethic. The exerciser looking at their own report would know what they need to improve upon in the future, and could practice that skill in order to perfect it.&lt;ref&gt;Blue, C. L. (1995). The predictive capacity of the theory of reasoned action and the theory of planned behavior in exercise research: An integrated literature review. Research in Nursing &amp; Health, 18(2), 105–121. https://doi.org/10.1002/nur.4770180205&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''aircraft design process''' is the [[engineering design process]] by which [[aircraft]] are designed. These depend on many factors such as customer and manufacturer demand, safety protocols, physical and economic constraints etc. For some types of aircraft the design process is regulated by national airworthiness authorities. This article deals with powered aircraft such as [[airplane]]s and [[helicopter]] designs.

Aircraft design is a compromise between many competing factors and constraints and accounts for existing designs and market requirements to produce the best aircraft.

==Design constraints==
===Purpose===
The design process starts with the aircraft's intended purpose. Commercial airliners are designed for carrying a passenger or cargo payload, long range and greater fuel efficiency where as fighter jets are designed to perform high speed maneuvers and provide close support to ground troops. Some aircraft have specific missions, for instance, [[Amphibious aircraft|amphibious airplanes]] have a unique design that allows them to operate from both land and water, some fighters, like the [[Harrier Jump Jet]], have [[VTOL]] (Vertical Take-off and Landing) ability, helicopters have the ability to hover over an area for a period of time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Hovering|url=http://www.dynamicflight.com/flight_maneuvers/hovering/|work=Flight maneuvers|publisher=www.dynamicflight.com|accessdate=2011-10-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The purpose may be to fit a specific requirement, e.g. as in the historical case of a [[list of Air Ministry specifications|British Air Ministry specification]], or fill a perceived "gap in the market"; that is, a class or design of aircraft which does not yet exist, but for which there would be significant demand.

===Aircraft regulations===
Another important factor that influences the design of the aircraft are the regulations put forth by [[National aviation authority|national airworthiness authorities]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.tc.gc.ca/eng/civilaviation/publications/tp14371-lra-2-0-2566.htm#2-7 | title=Airworthiness - Transport Canada | publisher=Transport Canada | work=Airworthiness Directives | access-date=2011-12-05 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110417023605/http://www.tc.gc.ca/eng/civilaviation/publications/tp14371-lra-2-0-2566.htm#2-7 | archive-date=2011-04-17 | dead-url=yes | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.casa.gov.au/scripts/nc.dll?WCMS:STANDARD::pc=PC_90822 | title=Airworthiness - CASA | publisher=CASA - Australian Government | work=Airworthiness Directives}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Airports may also impose limits on aircraft, for instance, the maximum wingspan allowed for a conventional aircraft is 80 m to prevent collisions between aircraft while taxiing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=ICAO Aerodrome Standards|url=http://www.icao.int/fsix/_Library%5CManual%20Aerodrome%20Stds.pdf|work=ICAO Regulations|publisher=ICAO|accessdate=5 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Financial factors and market===
Budget limitations, market requirements and competition set constraints on the design process and comprise the non-technical influences on aircraft design along with environmental factors. Competition leads to companies striving for better efficiency in the design without compromising performance and incorporating new techniques and technology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Civil Jet Aircraft Design|year=1999|publisher=Arnold Publishers|location=Great Britain|isbn=0-340-74152-X|author=Lloyd R. Jenkinson|author2=Paul Simpkin|author3=Darren Rhodes|page=10|chapter=Aircraft Market}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1950s and ’60s, unattainable project goals were regularly set, but then abandoned, whereas today troubled programs like the [[Boeing 787]] and the [[Lockheed Martin F-35]] have proven far more costly and complex to develop than expected.&lt;!--&lt;ref name=AvWeek6may2016&gt;--&gt;
More advanced and integrated design tools have been developed.&lt;!--&lt;ref name=AvWeek6may2016&gt;--&gt; [[Model-based systems engineering]] predicts potentially problematic interactions, while [[Computational science|computational analysis]] and optimization allows designers to explore more options early in the process.&lt;!--&lt;ref name=AvWeek6may2016&gt;--&gt; Increasing [[automation]] in engineering and manufacturing allows faster and cheaper develoment.&lt;!--&lt;ref name=AvWeek6may2016&gt;--&gt;
Technology advances from materials to manufacturing enable more complex design variations like multifunction parts.&lt;!--&lt;ref name=AvWeek6may2016&gt;--&gt; Once impossible to design or construct, these can now be [[3D printed]], but they have yet to prove their utility in applications like the [[Northrop Grumman B-21]] or the re-engined [[A320neo]] and [[737 MAX]].&lt;!--&lt;ref name=AvWeek6may2016&gt;--&gt; [[Airbus and Boeing]] also recognize the economic limits, that the next [[airliner]] generation cannot cost more than the previous ones did.&lt;ref name=AvWeek6may2016&gt;{{cite news |url= http://aviationweek.com/technology-milestones/problems-aerospace-still-has-solve |title= Problems Aerospace Still Has To Solve |date= May 6, 2016 |author= Graham Warwick |work= Aviation Week &amp; Space Technology}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Environmental factors===
An increase in the number of aircraft also means greater carbon emissions. Environmental scientists have voiced concern over the main kinds of pollution associated with aircraft, mainly noise and emissions. Aircraft engines have been historically notorious for creating noise pollution and the expansion of airways over already congested and polluted cities have drawn heavy criticism, making it necessary to have environmental policies for aircraft noise.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Travel(Air) - Aircraft Noise|url=http://ec.europa.eu/transport/air/environment/aircraft_noise_en.htm|work=Mobility and Transport|publisher=European Commission|accessdate=7 October 2011|date=2010-10-30|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090417003255/http://ec.europa.eu/transport/air/environment/aircraft_noise_en.htm#|archive-date=2009-04-17|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Annex 16 - Environmental Protection |url=http://www.icao.int/icaonet/anx/info/annexes_booklet_en.pdf |work=Convention on International Civil Aviation |publisher=ICAO |accessdate=8 October 2011 |page=29 |format=PDF |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111005040825/http://www.icao.int/icaonet/anx/info/annexes_booklet_en.pdf |archivedate=October 5, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Noise also arises from the airframe, where the airflow directions are changed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Airframe Noise Reduction|url=http://www.aeronautics.nasa.gov/docs/chicago/airframe.htm|work=NASA Aeronautics|publisher=NASA|accessdate=7 October 2011|author=William Wilshire|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111021225904/http://www.aeronautics.nasa.gov/docs/chicago/airframe.htm#|archive-date=2011-10-21|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Improved noise regulations have forced designers to create quieter engines and airframes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Environment: Aircraft Noise Reduction|url=http://www.aeronautics.nasa.gov/docs/chicago/noise.htm|work=NASA Aeronautics|publisher=NASA|accessdate=7 October 2011|author=Neal Nijhawan|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111018200346/http://www.aeronautics.nasa.gov/docs/chicago/noise.htm#|archive-date=2011-10-18|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Emissions from aircraft include particulates, [[carbon dioxide]] (CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;), [[Sulfur dioxide]](SO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;), [[Carbon monoxide]] (CO), various [[oxides]] of [[nitrates]] and unburnt [[hydrocarbons]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Safeguarding our atmosphere|url=http://www.nasa.gov/centers/glenn/about/fs10grc.html|work=Fact Sheet|publisher=NASA - Glenn Research Center|accessdate=7 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  To combat the pollution, ICAO set recommendations in 1981 to control aircraft emissions.&lt;ref name="Doc 9889"&gt;{{cite web|title=ICAO Airport Air Quality Guidance Manual |url=http://www.icao.int/icaonet/dcs/9889/9889_en.pdf |work=ICAO Guidelines |publisher=ICAO (International Civil Aviation Organisation) |accessdate=7 October 2011 |format=PDF |date=2007-04-15 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131214220636/http://www.icao.int/icaonet/dcs/9889/9889_en.pdf |archivedate=December 14, 2013 }}(see http://www.icao.int/environmental-protection/Documents/Publications/FINAL.Doc%209889.1st%20Edition.alltext.en.pdf for updated manual.&lt;/ref&gt; Newer, environmentally friendly fuels have been developed&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Biofuel Flight Demonstration|url=http://www.virgin-atlantic.com/en/us/allaboutus/environment/biofuel.jsp|work=Environment|publisher=Virgin Atlantic|accessdate=7 October 2011|year=2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the use of recyclable materials in manufacturing&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Aircraft Recycling : Life and times of an aircraft|url=http://www.iata.org/pressroom/airlines-international/august-2011/pages/aircraft-recycling.aspx|work=Pressroom - Airlines International|publisher=IATA|accessdate=7 October 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111027053159/http://www.iata.org/pressroom/airlines-international/august-2011/Pages/aircraft-recycling.aspx#|archive-date=2011-10-27|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; have helped reduce the ecological impact due to aircraft. Environmental limitations also affect airfield compatibility. Airports around the world have been built to suit the topography of the particular region. Space limitations, pavement design, runway end safety areas and the unique location of airport are some of the airport factors that influence aircraft design. However changes in aircraft design also influence airfield design as well, for instance, the recent introduction of new large aircraft (NLAs) such as the superjumbo [[Airbus A380]], have led to airports worldwide redesigning their facilities to accommodate its large size and service requirements.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=New Aircraft Characteristics Related To Airport Planning|url=http://my.fit.edu/~dkirk/3241/Lectures/Atrgpap.pdf|work=First ATRG Conference, Vancouver, Canada|publisher=Air Transport Research Group of the WCTR Society|accessdate=7 October 2011|author=Alexandre Gomes de Barros|author2=Sumedha Chandana Wirasinghe|format=PDF|year=1997}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Airports prepare for the A380|url=http://atwonline.com/airline-financedata/article/airports-prepare-a380-0309|work=Airline Finance/Data|publisher=ATW (Air Transport World)|accessdate=7 October 2011|author=Sandra Arnoult|date=2005-02-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Safety===
The high speeds, fuel tanks, atmospheric conditions at cruise altitudes, natural hazards (thunderstorms, hail and bird strikes) and human error are some of the many hazards that pose a threat to air travel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Bird hazards|url=http://www.airsafe.com/birds.htm|work=Hazards|publisher=www.airsafe.com|accessdate=12 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The human component in air accidents|url=http://www.pilotfriend.com/safe/safety/human_and_accidents.htm|work=Air Safety|publisher=www.pilotfriend.com|accessdate=12 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Aviation Weather Hazards |url=http://www.navcanada.ca/ContentDefinitionFiles/publications/lak/CanadianPrairies/2-P32E.PDF |work=LAKP Prairies |publisher=www.navcanada.ca |accessdate=12 October 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111216030637/http://www.navcanada.ca/ContentDefinitionFiles/publications/lak/CanadianPrairies/2-P32E.PDF |archivedate=16 December 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Airworthiness]] is the standard by which aircraft are determined fit to fly.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Airworthiness|url=http://www.thefreedictionary.com/airworthiness|work=Dictionary|publisher=The Free online Dictionary|accessdate=2011-10-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The responsibility for airworthiness lies with [[National aviation authority|national aviation regulatory bodies]], [[Aircraft manufacturers|manufacturers]], as well as owners and operators.{{Citation needed|date=October 2011}}

The [[International Civil Aviation Organization]] sets international standards and recommended practices for national authorities to base their regulations on &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.icao.int/environmental-protection/Pages/technology-standards.aspx | title=ICAO regulations | publisher=ICAO | accessdate=May 5, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press_release | url=http://www2.icao.int/en/ism/ICAO%20Annexes/Annex%208.pdf | title=Annex 8 - ICAO | publisher=ICAO | accessdate=May 5, 2012 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120905175315/http://www2.icao.int/en/ism/ICAO%20Annexes/Annex%208.pdf# | archive-date=2012-09-05 | dead-url=yes | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The national regulatory authorities set standards for airworthiness, issue certificates to manufacturers and operators and the standards of personnel training.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Civil Jet Aircraft Design|year=1999|publisher=Arnold Publishers|location=Great Britain|isbn=0-340-74152-X|author=L. Jenkinson|author2=P. Simpkin|author3= D. Rhodes|page=55}}&lt;/ref&gt; Every country has its own regulatory body such as the [[Federal Aviation Authority]] in USA, [[Directorate General of Civil Aviation (India)|DGCA (Directorate General of Civil Aviation)]] in India, etc.

The aircraft manufacturer makes sure that the aircraft meets existing design standards, defines the operating limitations and maintenance schedules and provides support and maintenance throughout the operational life of the aircraft. The aviation operators include the [[Civil aviation|passenger and cargo airliners]], [[Military aviation|air forces]] and owners of private aircraft. They agree to comply with the regulations set by the regulatory bodies, understand the limitations of the aircraft as specified by the manufacturer, report defects and assist the manufacturers in keeping up the airworthiness standards.{{Citation needed|date=October 2011}}

Most of the design criticisms these days are built on [[crashworthiness]]. Even with the greatest attention to airworthiness, accidents still occur. Crashworthiness is the qualitative evaluation of how aircraft survive an accident. The main objective is to protect the passengers or valuable cargo from the damage caused by an accident. In the case of airliners the stressed skin of the pressurized fuselage provides this feature, but in the event of a nose or tail impact, large bending moments build all the way through the fuselage, causing fractures in the shell, causing the fuselage to break up into smaller sections.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Crashworthy Design Principles|url=http://www.dtic.mil/cgi-bin/GetTRDoc?Location=U2&amp;doc=GetTRDoc.pdf&amp;AD=AD0623575|work=Technical Report|publisher=Defense Technical Information Center (DTIC)|accessdate=9 October 2011|author=D. L. Greer|author2=J. S. Breeden|author3=T. L. Heid|date=1965-11-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; So the passenger aircraft are designed in such a way that seating arrangements are away from areas likely to be intruded in an accident, such as near a propeller, engine nacelle undercarriage etc.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=ftp://ftp.rta.nato.int/PubFullText/RTO/EN/RTO-EN-HFM-113/EN-HFM-113-07.pdf|title=Basic Principles of Crashworthiness|publisher=NATO|author=Dennis F. Shanahan}}{{Dead link|date=October 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; The interior of the cabin is also fitted with safety features such as oxygen masks that drop down in the event of loss of cabin pressure, lockable luggage compartments, safety belts, lifejackets, emergency doors and luminous floor strips. Aircraft are sometimes designed with emergency [[water landing]] in mind, for instance the [[Airbus A330]] has a 'ditching' switch that closes valves and openings beneath the aircraft slowing the ingress of water.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Airbus A330-A340 Overhead Panel |url=http://www.smartcockpit.com/data/pdfs/plane/airbus/a340/instructor/A330-A340_Overhead_Pushbuttons.pdf |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120330161341/http://www.smartcockpit.com/data/pdfs/plane/airbus/a340/instructor/A330-A340_Overhead_Pushbuttons.pdf |dead-url=yes |archive-date=30 March 2012 |work=Data |publisher=www.smartcockpit.com |accessdate=9 October 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Design optimization==
Aircraft designers normally rough-out the initial design with consideration of all the constraints on their design. Historically design teams used to be small, usually headed by a Chief Designer who knows all the design requirements and objectives and coordinated the team accordingly. As time progressed, the complexity of military and airline aircraft also grew. Modern military and airline design projects are of such a large scale that every design aspect is tackled by different teams and then brought together. In general aviation a large number of light aircraft are designed and built by [[Homebuilt aircraft|amateur hobbyists and enthusiasts]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Amateur Built Aircraft|url=http://www.faa.gov/aircraft/gen_av/ultralights/amateur_built/|work=General Aviation and Recreational Aircraft|publisher=FAA|accessdate=2011-10-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Computer-aided design of aircraft==
[[File:Navion in Datcom3d.jpg|right|thumb|240px|The external surfaces of an aircraft modelled in [[MATLAB]]]]
In the early years of aircraft design, designers generally used analytical theory to do the various engineering calculations that go into the design process along with a lot of experimentation. These calculations were labour-intensive and time-consuming. In the 1940s, several engineers started looking for ways to automate and simplify the calculation process and many relations and semi-empirical formulas were developed. Even after simplification, the calculations continued to be extensive. With the invention of the computer, engineers realized that a majority of the calculations could be automated, but the lack of design visualization and the huge amount of experimentation involved kept the field of aircraft design stagnant. With the rise of programming languages, engineers could now write programs that were tailored to design an aircraft. Originally this was done with mainframe computers and used low-level programming languages that required the user to be fluent in the language and know the architecture of the computer. With the introduction of personal computers, design programs began employing a more user-friendly approach.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Aircraft Design Software|url=http://www.sti.nasa.gov/tto/spinoff1997/ct11.html|work=Computer Technology|publisher=NASA|accessdate=29 December 2014 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/19990824052440/http://www.sti.nasa.gov/tto/spinoff1997/ct11.html |archivedate = 24 August 1999}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Failed verification|date=December 2014}}

== Design aspects ==
The main aspects of aircraft design are:
#[[Aerodynamics]]
#[[Powered aircraft|Propulsion]]
#[[Aircraft flight control system|Controls]]
#[[Mass]]
#[[Fixed-wing aircraft#structure|Structure]]

All aircraft designs involve compromises of these factors to achieve the design mission.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Techniques for Aircraft Configuration Optimization|url=http://adg.stanford.edu/aa241/design/optimization1.html|work=Aircraft Design : Synthesis and Analysis|publisher=Stanford University|accessdate=2011-09-20|archive-url=https://archive.is/20120701103526/http://adg.stanford.edu/aa241/design/optimization1.html#|archive-date=2012-07-01|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Wing design ===
{{See also|Wing configuration}}
The wing of a fixed-wing aircraft provides the lift necessary for flight. Wing geometry affects every aspect of an aircraft’s flight. The wing area will usually be dictated by the desired [[stalling speed]] but the overall shape of the [[planform (aeronautics)|planform]] and other detail aspects may be influenced by wing layout factors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Civil jet aircraft design|isbn=0-340-74152-X|page=105}}&lt;/ref&gt; The wing can be mounted to the fuselage in high, low and middle positions. The wing design depends on many parameters such as selection of [[aspect ratio]], taper ratio, [[sweepback]] angle, thickness ratio, section profile, [[Washout (aviation)|washout]] and [[Dihedral (aircraft)|dihedral]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Civil Jet Aircraft design|isbn=0-340-74152-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The cross-sectional shape of the wing is its [[airfoil]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Understanding aircraft structures|isbn=1-4051-2032-0|author=John Cutler|author2=Jeremy Liber}}&lt;/ref&gt; The construction of the wing starts with the [[Rib (aircraft)|rib]] which defines the airfoil shape. Ribs can be made of wood, metal, plastic or even composites.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Aero Engineering Vol II Part I|year=1938|publisher=George Newnes|author=Hugh Nelson}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The wing must be designed and tested to ensure it can withstand the maximum loads imposed by maneuvering, and by atmospheric gusts.

=== Fuselage ===
{{Main|Fuselage}}
The fuselage is the part of the aircraft that contains the cockpit, passenger cabin or cargo hold.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Fuselage Layout|url=http://adg.stanford.edu/aa241/fuselayout/fusesection.html|publisher=Stanford University|accessdate=2011-09-18|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20010307121441/http://adg.stanford.edu/aa241/fuselayout/fusesection.html#|archive-date=2001-03-07|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Propulsion ===
[[File:Aircraft engine.jpg|thumb|Aircraft engine]]
{{Main|Aircraft engine}}
Aircraft propulsion may be achieved by specially designed aircraft engines, adapted auto, motorcycle or snowmobile engines, electric engines or even human muscle power. The main parameters of engine design are:{{Citation needed|date=October 2011}}
 
*Maximum engine thrust available
*Fuel consumption
*Engine mass
*Engine geometry

The thrust provided by the engine must balance the drag at cruise speed and be greater than the drag to allow acceleration. The engine requirement varies with the type of aircraft. For instance, commercial airliners spend more time in cruise speed and need more engine efficiency. High-performance fighter jets need very high acceleration and therefore have very high thrust requirements.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Beginner's Guide to Propulsion|url=http://www.grc.nasa.gov/WWW/K-12/airplane/bgp.html|work=Beginner's Guide|publisher=NASA|accessdate=2011-10-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Weight ===
{{Main|Aircraft gross weight}} 
The weight of the aircraft is the common factor that links all aspects of aircraft design such as aerodynamics, structure, and propulsion, all together. An aircraft's weight is derived from various factors such as empty weight, payload, useful load, etc. The various weights are used to then calculate the center of mass of the entire aircraft.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Aircraft weight and balance|url=http://www.pilotfriend.com/training/flight_training/wt_bal.htm|work=Pilot friend - Flight training|publisher=www.pilotfriend.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The center of mass must fit within the established limits set by the manufacturer.

=== Structure ===
The aircraft structure focuses not only on strength, stiffness, durability ([[Fatigue (material)|fatigue]]), fracture toughness, stability, but also on fail-safety, [[corrosion]] resistance, maintainability and ease of manufacturing. The structure must be able to withstand the stresses caused by [[cabin pressurization]], if fitted, turbulence and engine or rotor vibrations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Aircraft Structures|publisher=Elsevier Ltd.|isbn=978-1-85617-932-4|author=T.H.G Megson|edition=4th|page=353}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Design process and simulation==
{{Expand section|date=December 2011}}
The design of any aircraft starts out in three phases&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Aircraft Performance and design|year=1999|publisher=McGraw-Hill|isbn=0-07-001971-1|pages=382–386|author=John D. Anderson}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Conceptual Design===
[[File:Br-673.svg|thumb|Conceptual design of a [[Breguet Aviation|Breguet]] 673]]
The first design step, involves sketching a variety of possible aircraft configurations that meet the required design specifications. By drawing a set of configurations, designers seek to reach the design configuration that satisfactorily meets all requirements as well as go hand in hand with factors such as aerodynamics, propulsion, flight performance, structural and control systems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Aircraft Design - A conceptual approach|year=1992|publisher=American institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics|isbn=0-930403-51-7|page=4|author=D. Raymer}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This is called design optimization. Fundamental aspects such as fuselage shape, wing configuration and location, engine size and type are all determined at this stage. Constraints to design like those mentioned above are all taken into account at this stage as well. The final product is a conceptual layout of the aircraft configuration on paper or computer screen, to be reviewed by engineers and other designers.

===Preliminary design phase===
The design configuration arrived at in the conceptual design phase is then tweaked and remodeled to fit into the design parameters. In this phase, [[wind tunnel]] testing and [[Computational fluid dynamics|computational fluid dynamic]] calculations of the flow field around the aircraft are done. Major structural and control analysis is also carried out in this phase. Aerodynamic flaws and structural instabilities if any are corrected and the final design is drawn and finalized. Then after the finalization of the design lies the key decision with the manufacturer or individual designing it whether to actually go ahead with the production of the aircraft.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Aircraft design - A conceptual approach|year=1992|publisher=American institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics|isbn=0-930403-51-7|page=5|author=D. Raymer}}&lt;/ref&gt;  At this point several designs, though perfectly capable of flight and performance, might have been opted out of production due to their being economically nonviable.

===Detail design phase===
This phase simply deals with the fabrication aspect of the aircraft to be manufactured. It determines the number, design and location of [[Rib (aircraft)|ribs]], [[Spar (aviation)|spars]], sections and other structural elements.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Aircraft performance and Design|year=1999|publisher=Mc Graw Hill|isbn=0-07-001971-1|author=John D. Anderson}}&lt;/ref&gt;  All aerodynamic, structural, propulsion, control and performance aspects have already been covered in the preliminary design phase and only the manufacturing remains. [[Flight simulator]]s for aircraft are also developed at this stage.

== Program development ==

An existing aircraft program can be developed for performance and economy gains by stretching the [[fuselage]], increasing the [[MTOW]], enhancing the aerodynamics, installing new [[aircraft engine|engine]]s, new wings or new avionics.
For a 9,100 nmi long range at Mach 0.8/FL360, a 10% lower [[Thrust specific fuel consumption|TSFC]] saves 13% of fuel, a 10% [[Lift-to-drag ratio|L/D]] increase saves 12%, a 10% lower [[OEW]] saves 6% and all combined saves 28%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url= https://download.nap.edu/cart/download.cgi?record_id=11837 |title= Improving the Efficiency of Engines for Large Nonfighter Aircraft |author= Committee on Analysis of Air Force Engine Efficiency Improvement Options for Large Non-fighter Aircraft |work= [[US Air Force]] Studies Board - Division on Engineering and Physical Sciences |publisher= [[US National Research Council]] |isbn= 0-309-66765-8 |date= 2007 |page=15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Baptistery of Albenga''' is a paleochristian religious structure in [[Albenga]],  province of Savona, in the region of [[Liguria]] of northern [[Italy]]. It is an example of 5th-century late-[[Ancient Roman]] architecture with mosaic decoration, and stands adjacent to the [[Albenga Cathedral]] of San Michele Arcangelo.

==Description==
Inscriptions date construction to the 5th century under a Flavio Costanzo. The layout is that of a decagon with an octagonal drum. The building still retains an octagonal baptismal font and 6th century mosaics with allegorical symbols of Christ such as the [[Labarum]] (Chi - Rho) and the [[Alpha and Omega]]. The walls have traces of 15th-century frescoes. The interior houses two [[Lombards|Lombard]] burial monuments. The original foundations are lower than the present one. The roof was remodeled and replaced in 1898 by a wooden structure.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.comune.albenga.sv.it/servizi/Menu/dinamica.aspx?idSezione=152&amp;idArea=153&amp;idCat=2738&amp;ID=2740&amp;TipoElemento=categoria Comune of Albenga], entry on baptistery.&lt;/ref&gt; The baptistery is now part of the town Museo Diocesano&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.amei.biz/musei/museo-diocesano-di-albenga-e-battistero-paleocrist Museo Diocesano official site].&lt;/ref&gt;

The niche with late-Roman Empire Christian mosaics depicts an Alpha-Omega within three concentric circles symbolizing the Trinity, and surrounded by 12 doves symbolizing the apostles who disseminated the teachings under the guidance of the Holy Spirit. Finally two sheep stand in a field around a cross. The Latin inscription of the arch recalls relics held in the church.

The '''American Craft Council''' ('''ACC''') is a national nonprofit organization based in Minneapolis, Minnesota, that champions craft. Founded in 1943 by [[Aileen Osborn Webb]], the council today hosts national craft shows and conferences,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://craftcouncil.org/shows|title=craftcouncil.org/shows|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20132216345300/http://www.craftcouncil.org/shows|archive-date=2018-02-11|dead-url=no|access-date=|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; publishes a bi-monthly magazine called ''American Craft'' &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://craftcouncil.org/magazine|title=American Craft Magazine|website=American Craft Council|accessdate=30 November 2017|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20132216362100/http://www.craftcouncil.org/magazine|archivedate=11 February 2018|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and a quarterly journal called ''American Craft Inquiry'',&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://craftcouncil.org/american-craft-inquiry|title=craftcouncil.org/american-craft-inquiry|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171130130838/https://craftcouncil.org/american-craft-inquiry|archive-date=2017-11-30|dead-url=no|access-date=|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; maintains an extensive awards program,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://craftcouncil.org/about-acc/acc-awards|title=ACC Awards - American Craft Council|website=American Craft Council|accessdate=30 November 2017|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171130130838/https://craftcouncil.org/about-acc/acc-awards|archivedate=30 November 2017|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and is home to a comprehensive library and archives.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://craftcouncil.org/library|title=craftcouncil.org/library|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20132216403400/http://www.craftcouncil.org/library|archive-date=2018-02-11|dead-url=no|access-date=|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
In 1939, philanthropist and social advocate Aileen Osborn Webb formed the Handcraft Cooperative League of America, an affiliation of craft groups organized to develop markets in metropolitan areas for rural craftsmen. The same year, the American Handcraft Council is formed in Delaware by [[Anne Morgan (philanthropist)|Anne Morgan]], a friend and neighbor of Webb. In 1940, Webb's League opens a cooperative retail venue called America House at 7 East 54th Street in Manhattan. In 1941, they publish a first, untitled issue of what would later become the magazine ''Craft Horizons''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://digital.craftcouncil.org/digital/collection/p15785coll2/id/30/rec/1|title=Craft Horizons, November 1941 (Volume 1, Number 1)|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171130130838/http://digital.craftcouncil.org/digital/collection/p15785coll2/id/30/rec/1|archive-date=2017-11-30|dead-url=no|access-date=|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1942, Anne Morgan's American Handcraft Council and Aileen Osborn Webb's Handcraft Cooperative League of America merge into a single organization, the American Craftsmen's Cooperative Council, Inc. In 1943, the merged organizations initiate the American Craftsmen's Educational Council, and are granted a provisional charter from the Board of Regents of the Education Department of New York.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://craftcouncil.org/about-acc/our-history|title=craftcouncil.org/about-acc/our-history|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170729093430/https://craftcouncil.org/about-acc/our-history|archive-date=2017-07-29|dead-url=no|access-date=|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  
 
For the next decade, the Council maintained their New York retail venue, initiated exhibitions featuring practicing craft artists (including "Designer Craftsmen USA", which was hosted by the Brooklyn Museum, the Art Institute of Chicago, and the San Francisco Museum of Art&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://digital.craftcouncil.org/digital/collection/p15785coll5/id/4074/rec/1|title=Catalog of the exhibition "Designer Craftsmen U.S.A. 1953"|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171130130838/http://digital.craftcouncil.org/digital/collection/p15785coll5/id/4074/rec/1|archive-date=2017-11-30|dead-url=no|access-date=|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;), and hosted national competitions such as "Young Americans" for craftspeople under 30. In 1955, the American Craftsmen's Education Council shortened its name to the American Craftsmen's Council and the acronym ACC fell into use.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;   
 
In 1956, the Council opened the Museum of Contemporary Crafts, now the [[Museum of Arts and Design]], in a brownstone purchased by Webb at 29 West 53rd Street in New York City. The museum's inaugural exhibition "Craftsmanship in a Changing World"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://digital.craftcouncil.org/digital/collection/p15785coll5/id/2614/rec/1|title=digital.craftcouncil.org/digital/collection/p15785coll5/id/2614/rec/1|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171130130838/http://digital.craftcouncil.org/digital/collection/p15785coll5/id/2614/rec/1|archive-date=2017-11-30|dead-url=no|access-date=|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; featured 314 objects by 180 craftspeople from 19 states. The new building also housed the offices for ''Craft Horizons'' and the council's first formal library space. The Council launched its first national conference and began publishing a newsletter, ''Outlook'', in 1957. In 1959, the Council divests in the retail space America House, which relocates to a brownstone purchased by Webb until closing 1971. In 1960, ''Craft Horizons'' is officially incorporated into the Council and subscribers are automatically enrolled as members. For the next decade, the council continues to host conferences, present and tour exhibitions through the Museum of Contemporary Crafts, and expand educational and awards programs.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

In 1966, ACC held its first regional craft fair in Stowe, Vermont, a precursor to the annual shows the Council continues to present in Baltimore, Atlanta, Saint Paul, and San Francisco.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://craftcouncil.org/shows|title=ACC Shows|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20132216345300/http://www.craftcouncil.org/shows|archive-date=2018-02-11|dead-url=no|access-date=|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1969, one year after celebrating its 25th anniversary, the American Craftsmen's Council changed its name to the American Crafts Council.

The 1970s bring many significant changes to ACC, including its first cohort of Fellows, elected in 1975. Over 200 craft artists, scholars, and philanthropists have now been honored through induction into the Council's College of Fellows.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://craftcouncil.org/about-acc/acc-awards/american-craft-council-college-of-fellows|title=College of Fellows|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170823121352/https://craftcouncil.org/about-acc/acc-awards/american-craft-council-college-of-fellows|archive-date=2017-08-23|dead-url=no|access-date=|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; While continuing to host shows and conferences, the Council relocates in 1978 to 22 West 55th Street and in 1979 the Museum of Contemporary Crafts reopens as the American Craft Museum at 44 West 53rd Street. The same year, ''Craft Horizons'' is renamed ''American Craft'' and founder Aileen Osborn Webb dies at age 87.

Another series of relocations take place throughout the 1980s, and in 1990 the American Craft Museum becomes independent. At the Council's new, larger space at 72 Spring Street, the library has space to expand throughout the 1990s, taking on significant donations from the estate of glass artist Robert Sowers and from [[Ed Rossbach]] and [[Mildred Constantine]]. Efforts  to develop a computer database for the library began in 1988, and the Council officially launches its website in 1999. In 2001, the library's catalog becomes accessible online.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

In the 2000s, the Council renames and restructures its awards program and begins hosting "convenings," small-scale gatherings of key stakeholders in the field of craft meant to encourage peer-to-peer conversation. In 2010, ACC relocates from New York City to Minneapolis, MN, establishing an office and library in the historic Grain Belt Brewery building at 1224 Marshall Street NE. Not long after the relocation, the Council launches a new website that includes information for both ''American Craft'' magazine and the Council itself. In 2015, ACC launches several programs to highlight and serve emerging artists; Hip Pop, a shows initiative that provides a pathway for emerging artists to successfully take part in ACC shows, and Emerging Voices, an awards program that honors top emerging artist and scholars.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

It lists [[legendary creature|fantastic creatures]] found in [[Bestiary|medieval bestiaries]] as well as those reported by explorers from abroad and gives explanations to why they are excluded from Systema Naturae.

Linnaeus remarked in edition 6 (as translated) as at [http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v415/n6871/full/415479a.html this link]: "''I have come to these conclusions by personally leading my pupils on wanderings through the tangled web of nature, in order that I can spur others on to an examination and explanation of nature rather than the reiteration of perceived ideas ... I shall take exception to the tales of actors and the barkings of dogs with equal measure.''".&lt;/ref&gt;

== ''Paradoxa'' ==
These 10 taxa appear in the 1st to 5th editions:
* [[Lernaean Hydra|Hydra]]: Linnaeus wrote: "Hydra: body of a snake, with two feet, seven necks and the same number of heads, lacking wings, preserved in [[Hamburg]], similar to the description of the Hydra of the [[Apocalypse]] of St.John chapters 12 and 13. And it is provided by very many as a true species of animal, but falsely. Nature for itself and always the similar, never naturally makes multiple heads on one body. Fraud and artifice, as we ourselves saw [on it] teeth of a weasel, different from teeth of an Amphibian [or reptile], easily detected." See [[Carl Linnaeus#Doctorate]]. (Distinguish from the small real coelenterate [[Hydra (genus)]].)
* [[Pseudis paradoxa|Rana-Piscis]]: a South American frog which is significantly smaller than its [[tadpole]] stage; it was thus (incorrectly) reported to Linnaeus that the metamorphosis in this species went from 'frog to fish'. In the Paradoxa in the 1st edition of Systema Naturae, Linnaeus wrote "Frog-Fish or Frog Changing into Fish: is much against teaching. Frogs, like all Amphibia, delight in lungs and spiny bones. Spiny fish, instead of lungs, are equipped with gills. Therefore the laws of Nature will be against this change. If indeed a fish is equipped with gills, it will be separate from the Frog and Amphibia. If truly [it has] lungs, it will be a Lizard: for under all the sky it differs from [[Chondropterygii]] and [[Plagiuri]].". In the 10th edition of Systema Naturae, Linnaeus named the species ''[[Pseudis paradoxa|Rana paradoxa]]'', though its genus name was changed in 1830 to ''[[Pseudis]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author =S. W. Garman |year=1877 |title=''Pseudis'', the paradoxical frog |journal=[[The American Naturalist]] |volume=11 |issue=10 |pages=587–591 |url=https://archive.org/stream/americannatural04instgoog#page/n591/mode/2up |jstor=2447862 |doi=10.1086/271961}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Monocerus|Monoceros]] (unicorn): Linnaeus wrote: "Monoceros of the older [generations], body of a horse, feet of a "wild animal", horn straight, long, spirally twisted. It is a figment of painters. The [[Monodon]] of [[Peter Artedi|Artedi]] [= narwhal] has the same manner of horn, but the other parts of its body are very different."
* [[Pelican#Symbolism and popular culture|Pelecanus]]: Linnaeus wrote "Pelican: The same [sources as for the previous] hand down fabulously [the story] that it inflicts a wound with its beak on its own thigh, to feed its young with the flowing blood. A sack hanging below its throat gave a handle for the story."

* [[Satyrus (ape)|Satyrus]]: Linnaeus wrote "with a tail, hairy, bearded, with a manlike body, gesticulating much, very fallacious, is a species of monkey, if ever one has been seen."&lt;ref name="kth.se"&gt;Carl Linnaeus, Systema naturae (1735; facsimile of the first edition), trans.

* [[Vegetable Lamb of Tartary|Borometz]] (aka [[Scythia]]n Lamb): Linnaeus wrote: "Borometz or [[Scythia]]n Lamb: is reckoned with plants, and is similar to a lamb; whose stalk coming out of the ground enters an [[Navel|umbilicus]]; and the same is said to be provided with blood from by chance devouring wild animals. But it is put together artificially from roots of American ferns. But naturally it is an [[allegorical]] description of an ''[[embryo]] of a sheep'', as has all attributed data.".

* [[Phoenix (mythology)|Phoenix]]: Linnaeus wrote: "Species of bird, of which only one individual exists in the world, and which when decrepit [arises?] from [its] pyre made of aromatic [plants?] is said fabulously to become again young, to undergo happy former periods of life. In reality it is the [[date palm]], see ''[[Engelbert Kaempfer|Kæmpf]]''".
* Linnaeus wrote: The [[Barnacle goose#Folklore|Bernicla]] or [[Scotland|Scottish]] goose &amp; Goose-bearing Seashell: is believed by former generations to be born from rotten wood thrown away in the sea. But the [[Lepas]] places seaweed on its featherlike internal parts, and somewhat adhering, as if indeed that goose Bernicla was arising from it. [[Frederick Edward Hulme]] noted: "[The] barnacle-goose tree was a great article of faith with our ancestors in the Middle Ages."&lt;ref name="google"&gt;{{cite book|title=Myth-land|author =Hulme, F.E.|date=1886|publisher=S. Low, Marston, Searle &amp; Rivington|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=qrBZAAAAMAAJ|page=168|accessdate=2015-04-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Dragon|Draco]]: Linnaeus wrote that it has a "snakelike body, two feet, two wings, like a bat, which is a ''[[Draco (genus)|winged lizard]]'' or a ''[[Raja (genus)|ray]]'' artificially shaped as a monster and dried."&lt;ref name="kth.se"/&gt; See also [[Jenny Haniver]].
* [[Death watch beetle|Automa Mortis]] Linnaeus wrote "Death-watch: It produces the sound of a very small clock in walls, is named ''Pediculus pulsatorius'', which perforates wood and lives in it".

The above 10 taxa and the 4 taxa following were in the 2nd (1740) edition and the 4th and 5th editions (total 14 entries):&lt;ref name="google2"&gt;{{cite book|title=Systema naturae in quo naturae regna tria: secundum classes, ordines, genera, species, systematice proponuntur|author =von Linné, C.|date=1740|publisher=Apud G.

* [[Manticore|Manticora]]: Linnaeus wrote merely: "face of a decrepit old man, body of a lion, tail starred with sharp points".
* [[Antelope#Etymology|Antilope]] {{sic}}: Linnaeus wrote merely: "Face of a "wild animal", feet [like those] of cattle, horns like a goat's [but] saw-edged".
* [[Lamia (mythology)|Lamia]]: Linnaeus wrote merely: "Face of a man, breasts of a virgin, body of a four-footed animal [but] scaled, forefeet of a "wild animal", hind[feet] [like those] of cattle".
* [[Siren (mythology)|Siren]]: Linnaeus wrote: "''[[Peter Artedi|Art.]] [[Genus|gen.]]'' 81 Syrene ''[[Thomas Bartholin|Bartol]]'': As long as it is not seen either living or dead, nor faithfully and perfectly described, it is called in doubt".
*::Linnaeus's reference is to [[Peter Artedi]]'s writing about the Siren: "Two fins only on all the body, those on the chest. No finned tail. Head and neck and chest to the umbilicus have the human appearance. ... Our or Bartholin's Siren was found and captured in the sea near Massilia in America. From the umbilicus to the extremity of the body was unformed flesh with no sign of a tail. Two pectoral fins on the chest, with five bones or fingers, staying together, by which it swims. Its [[radius (bone)|radius]] in the forearm is scarcely four fingers' width long. Oh that there could arise a true [[ichthyologist]], who could examine this animal, as to whether it is a fable, or a true fish? About something which has not been seen it is preferable not to judge, than boldly to pronounce something.". Among references and quotations from other authors Artedi quoted that "some say that it is a [[manatee]] and others say completely different."&lt;ref&gt;Peter Artedi, 1738, [https://books.google.com/books?id=5XRcAAAAcAAJ&amp;pg=PA81#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Philosophia Ichthyologica], p. 81.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Anthony Stephen Mathew''' (1734–1824&lt;ref name = LondonSurvey/&gt;) was a cleric the [[Church of England]]. He and his wife [[Harriet Mathew]] are most notable for their friendship and support of [[John Flaxman]] and [[William Blake]] and their gathering of intellectuals and artists salon in their house at [[Rathborne Place]]. Importantly, he was one of the original supporters of Blake's first collection of work ''[[Poetical Sketches]]'' (1783).&lt;ref name = BlakeDict&gt;{{cite dictionary |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=HOxpOMQ_Pa8C&amp;pg=PA330| title = Poetical Sketches| work=A Blake Dictionary: The Ideas and Symbols of William Blake | pages= 330–331 |first= S.

At the age of 17, Mathew entered the college [[Peterhouse, Cambridge|Peterhouse]] at [[Cambridge University]], subsequently entering the Church of England. Anthony Stephen Mathew was the first incumbent of [[Percy Chapel, Charlotte Street]], London starting in 1766 through 1804. He was succeeded by [[Thomas Beaseley]].Throughout his career in the church, he was rector of [[Glooston]], Leicestershire from 1781 and the [[Duke of Buccleuch]] gave him the rectorship of [[Broughton, Northamptonshire]] in 1790 which he held until he died.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10368">The '''Art &amp; Architecture Thesaurus''' (AAT) is a [[controlled vocabulary]] used for describing items of art, architecture, and material culture.  The AAT contains generic terms, such as "cathedral," but no proper names, such as "Cathedral of Notre Dame."  The AAT is used by, among others, [[museum]]s, art libraries, [[archive]]s, [[Cataloging#Cataloging rules|catalogers]], and [[researcher]]s in art and [[art history]].  The AAT is a [[thesaurus]] in compliance with [[International Organization for Standardization|ISO]] and [[NISO]] standards including [[ISO 2788]], [[ISO 25964]] and ANSI/NISO Z39.19.

The AAT is a structured vocabulary of around 44,000 concepts,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=SPARQL query to count AAT concepts|url=http://vocab.getty.edu/sparql?query=select+%28count%28*%29+as+%3Fc%29+%7B%3Fx+skos%3AinScheme+aat%3A%7D&amp;_implicit=false&amp;implicit=true&amp;_equivalent=false&amp;_form=%2Fsparql|website=Getty Linked Open Data}}&lt;/ref&gt; including 131,000 terms, descriptions, bibliographic citations, and other information relating to fine art, architecture, decorative arts, archival materials, and material culture.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.getty.edu/research/conducting_research/vocabularies/|title=Getty Vocabularies (Getty Research Institute)|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The AAT project began in the late 1970s in response to the gradual automation of records by art libraries, art journal indexing services, and catalogers of museum objects and visual resources.  Automation required consistency in [[cataloging]] as well as more efficient [[information retrieval|retrieval of information]]; a controlled vocabulary was a solution to both these problems.  The project was conceived by [[library director]]s and architectural experts Toni Petersen, Dora Crouch, and Pat Molholt and was originally headquartered part-time at RPI in Troy, NY, then at Bennington College in Bennington, VT and later moved to [[Williamstown, Massachusetts]], with the [[J. Paul Getty Trust]] providing technical advice and funding.  In 1983 the Getty Trust took over [[editing|editor]]ial responsibility.  The AAT offices relocated to the Getty's Los Angeles headquarters in order to better coordinate with two other similar Getty projects, the [[Union List of Artist Names]] (ULAN) and [[Getty Thesaurus of Geographic Names]] (TGN) soon after its publication.

The AAT was published in 1990 and 1994 in both print and electronic form. By 1997, the size and frequency of updates  made hard-copy publication unfeasible and the decision was made to publish via a searchable online Web interface and in data files available for licensing. The online Web interface is freely-accessible from any computer connected to the Internet. Final editorial control of the AAT is maintained by the [[Getty Vocabulary Program]], part of the [[Getty Research Institute]].

Since 2008, Taiwan e-Learning and Digital Archives Program (TELDAP)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://teldap.tw/en|title=Preface, Taiwan e-Learning and Digital Archives Program, TELDAP|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; collaborated with [[Getty Research Institute]] (GRI) in developing the [[Chinese-language]] Art &amp; Architecture Thesaurus (AAT-Taiwan). The initial goal of this project is to provide multilingual search and corresponding images in integrate digital archives systems of [[Taiwan]], and broaden the inclusion of terms related to Asian art, architecture and material culture in AAT.

The AAT can be used in several ways:
* at the data entry stage, by catalogers or indexers who are describing works of art, architecture, material culture, archival materials, visual surrogates, or bibliographic materials;
* as knowledge bases, providing information for researchers; 
* as search assistants to enhance end-user access to online resources;
* as target for enriching free-text descriptions of cultural objects;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Europeana enriches its data with the AAT|url=http://pro.europeana.eu/page/europeana-aat|website=Europeana Pro}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* as a pivot vocabulary for coreferencing (interlinking) other art vocabularies&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Ceri Binding and Douglas Tudhope|title=Vocabulary Linked Data Publication and Mapping|url=http://www.iskouk.org/sites/default/files/Binding_etalSlidesISKO-UK2015.pptx|publisher=ISKO UK 2015 Workshop}}&lt;/ref&gt;

AAT is available as [[Linked Open Data]] at vocab.getty.edu&lt;ref&gt;http://vocab.getty.edu&lt;/ref&gt; since February 2014&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blogs.getty.edu/iris/art-architecture-thesaurus-now-available-as-linked-open-data/|title=Art &amp; Architecture Thesaurus Now Available as Linked Open Data - The Getty Iris|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and is updated bi-weekly.

==Terms==
The initial core set of terms was derived from authority lists and the literature of art and architectural history; this core set was reviewed, approved and added to by an advisory team made up scholars from all relevant disciplines, including art and architectural historians, [[architect]]s, [[librarian]]s, visual resource [[curator]]s, [[archivist]]s, museum personnel, and specialists in [[thesaurus]] construction.  Its [[hierarchy]] was inspired by the [[Medical Subject Headings]].  All eras from antiquity to the present are covered, and it is not limited geographically.

As of January 2007, the AAT contained approximately 131,000 terms. While the thesaurus contains many variations on a term, such as [[grammatical number|singular and plural forms]], spelling variants, various forms of speech, and [[synonym]]s, one is always flagged as the preferred term.  Terms are updated biweekly and regular users are encouraged to propose new terms.

In 2015 AAT contains 354,000 terms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=SPARQL query to count AAT terms|url=http://vocab.getty.edu/sparql?query=select+%28count%28*%29+as+%3Fc%29+%7B%3Fx+skos%3AinScheme+aat%3A%3B+xl%3AprefLabel%7Cxl%3AaltLabel+%3Fy%7D&amp;_implicit=false&amp;implicit=true&amp;_equivalent=false&amp;_form=%2Fsparql|website=Getty Linked Open Data}}&lt;/ref&gt; They are available in 4 major languages (English, Dutch, Spanish and Chinese), and some terms in various native languages.

==Design==
The AAT is a [[faceted classification]] system as well as a hierarchical one.  There are seven facets:

* Associated Concepts - [[abstract concept]]s, such as beauty, balance, connoisseurship, metaphor, freedom, socialism (Hierarchy: Associated concepts)
* Physical Attributes - perceptible or measurable characteristics such as size, shape, chemical properties, texture and hardness, such as strapwork, borders, round, waterlogged, brittleness. (Hierarchies: Attributes and Properties, Conditions and Effects, Design Elements, Color)
*Styles and Periods - stylistic groupings and distinct chronological periods, such as [[France|French]], Louis XIV, [[T'ang Dynasty]], [[Thomas Chippendale|Chippendale]] (Hierarchy: Styles and Periods)
* Agents - people, groups of people, and organizations such as [[printmaker]]s, [[landscape architect]]s, corporations, [[religious order]]s. (Hierarchies: People, Organizations)
* Activities - areas of endeavor, physical and mental actions or methods, such as [[archaeology]], [[engineering]], analyzing, contests, [[Art exhibition|exhibition]]s, running, drawing (image-making), [[corrosion]]. (Hierarchies: Disciplines, Functions, Events, Physical and Mental Activities, Processes and Techniques)
* Materials - physical substances, such as iron, clay, adhesive, emulsifier, artificial ivory, [[Millwork (building material)|millwork]], nylon. (Hierarchy: Materials)
* Objects - objects either fabricated or given form by human activity, such as [[painting]]s, [[amphora]]e, [[facade]]s, [[cathedral]]s, [[Brewster Chair]]s, [[garden]]s (Hierarchies: Object Groupings and Systems, Object Genres, Components; Built Environment: Settlements and Landscapes, Built Complexes and Districts, Single Built Works, Open Spaces and Site Elements; Furnishings and Equipment: Furnishings, Costume, Tools and Equipment, Weapons and Ammunition, Measuring Devices, Containers, Sound Devices, Recreational Artifacts, Transportation Vehicles; Visual and Verbal Communication: Visual Works, Exchange Media, Information Forms)
==Online records of concepts showing the hierarchy in the database==
The record for each concept includes its place in the hierarchy (with a link to its parent), as well as links to related terms, related concepts, sources and contributors for the data, and notes.

'''Arthur Quartley''' (May 24, 1839 – May 19, 1886) was an [[United States|American]] painter known for his marine seascapes.

==Biography==
Quartley was born in [[Paris]] and lived there to the age of twelve, when his family moved to [[Baltimore, Maryland]]. He studied drawing with his father [[Frederick William Quartley]], who was an [[England|English]] [[engraving|engraver]]. His father was reputed to have demanded two drawings per week from the young lad.  At age 17, Arthur was apprenticed to a sign painter in Baltimore.

In 1862 Quartley and his family founded a design firm in Baltimore. The firm Emmart &amp; Quartley was regarded as the best decorating company in the city (''Dictionary of American Biography''); however, young Quartley began painting marine seascapes of [[Chesapeake Bay]], and progressively spent more and more time in that pursuit. He held a successful show of marine paintings at the studio of Norval H. Busey in Baltimore. Scholar [[Elizabeth Johns]] remarked that Quartley's work reveals familiarity with the [[Dutch Masters]] marine tradition of composition in treatment of light and color.

To pursue his painting more seriously, Quartley moved to [[New York City]] in 1875. New York at that time had become a premier center for notable painters. From there he painted seascapes of [[Long Island]] bays, [[New York Harbor]], the New Hampshire [[Isle of Shoals]], and [[Naragansett Bay]] in [[Rhode Island]].

The [[Hudson River School]] was waning at this point, so that other groups were forming, among them the [[Tilers]], of whom Quartley was a founding member. The Tilers was a group of artists and writers, that included such luminaries as [[Winslow Homer]], [[William Merritt Chase]], and [[Augustus Saint Gaudens]]. They met frequently to exchange ideas and decorate ceramic tiles in promotion of their works. They also took excursions for painting, such as the 1878 pilgrimage to Eastern Long Island by Quartley and ten others. On that trip Quartley painted ''Seascape'' and also a blue painted tile of an introspective girl at the beach. The journalist and philanthropist [[John W. McCoy]] promoted the careers of Quartley and of his friend, the sculptor [[William H. Rinehart]].

In the year 1876 Quartley was elected to the [[National Academy of Design|National Academy]].  Quartley's prominence during his lifetime is illustrated by his inclusion as one of 68 painters in the publication ''American Painters'' (1880). Some of his noteworthy canvases are: ''Early Moonlight, Naragansett Bay'' (1877); ''Afternoon in August, Coast of Maine'' (1878); and ''Low Country on the North Shore of Long Island'' (1881).

[[File:Ivanovo Obl Palekh asv2018-08 img18.jpg|thumb|A bell-ringer at work in [[Palekh]], [[Russia]]]]
A '''bell-ringer''' is a person who rings a [[Bell (instrument)|bell]], usually a [[church bell]], by means of a rope or other mechanism. 

Despite some automation of bells for random swinging, there are still a large number of active bell ringers in the world, particularly those with an advanced ringing tradition such as full-circle or Russian ringing, which are artistic and skilled performances which are difficult to automate.

The term campanologist is popularly mis-used to refer to a bell ringer, but this properly refers to someone who studies bells, which is known as [[campanology]]. &lt;ref&gt;From Glossary of the Central Council of Church Bell Ringers 2016; " Campanologist - One who studies campanology, (popularly mis-used to refer to a ringer).&lt;/ref&gt; 

Although in some places [[carillon]]s are used to sound bells, they are "played" by carillonneurs, not by bell ringers, and are associated with the ringing of tunes in the Western musical tradition. 

==Full-circle ringing==
===English full-circle ringing===
{{Main|change ringing}}
[[Image:bells.devon.750pix.jpg|thumb|English full-circle bell ringers at [[Stoke Gabriel]] parish church, [[Devon]], England]]
In England, for instance, it is estimated there are about 40,000 bell ringers ringing on [[ring of bells|rings of bells]] in the English [[Full circle ringing|full-circle]] style. This type of ringing cannot be automated because of the large rotating masses of the bells and the exact regulation in speed of striking that is required for [[change ringing]]. 

The high level of control exerted by ringers means the bells can be struck with both accurate and equal spacing, and can change their striking pattern at each stroke. In addition the Doppler effect due to the movement of the bell when it is struck, and the sharp attack of the strike and the fast die-away due to damping by the clapper, imparts a unique musical sound.  

This style of ringing takes place every week in several thousand belfries in England and is supported by the [[Central Council of Church Bell Ringers]] founded in 1891, which is also dedicated to representing change ringers around the world.

===Bolognese full-circle ringing===
{{main|Bolognese bell ringing art}}
This system originated  during the [[Middle Ages]], and was perfected in the 19th century.  It is a form of [[full circle ringing]] which requires the bell ringers to manually swing the bells whilst standing beside them in the bell chamber. It was originally designed for an ensemble of four or five bells, nowadays it is also sometimes used for a set of six bells.

The bells are never counterbalanced. They are mounted on a wooden structure called ''the castle'', and flanked by a wooden support called ''the goat''. The bells are not very heavy, as the rotation has to be fast. Generally, every bell that weighs less than 800 kg (16 cwt) is rung by one person. The heaviest bell used with this system is in [[Bologna Cathedral]], and is called ''la Nonna'' ("the Granny") and weighs 3.3 tonnes. Thirteen people are needed to ring a ''scappata'' or a ''calata'' with it. The bell ringers have to be in contact with the bells and mechanical devices are not allowed.

===Veronese full circle ringing===
 {{main|Veronese bellringing art}}
This method of full circle ringing is similar to English full-circle ring, in that it uses ropes to enable the bell ringers to manipulate the bells. It is not clear whether hanging the bells in this way was independently developed at San Giorgio or whether the method was imported from England where bells are also hung for full circle ringing.

==Chiming==
Chiming is the art of ringing bells which are "hung dead" or stationary.
===Russia===
[[File:Bell-ringer yaroslavl 2012.ogv|thumb|Bell-ringer demonstrating Russian chiming on a portable belfry]]
Bell ringing saw a spectacular revival in Russia, with the growth of the [[Russian Orthodox Church]], (see [[Russian Orthodox bell ringing]]).

Technically, bells rung in the Russian tradition are sounded exclusively by [[Chime (bell instrument)|chiming]] (i.e., moving only the clapper so that it strikes the side of a stationary bell) and never by swinging the bell. For the Russian tradition a special complex system of ropes is used, designed individually for each belltower. All the ropes are gathered at approximately one point, where the bell-ringer (''zvonar'') stands. Some ropes (the smaller ones) are played by hand, the bigger ropes are played by foot. The major part of the ropes (usually - all ropes) are not actually pulled, but rather pressed. Since one end of every rope is fixed, and the ropes are kept in tension, a press or even a punch on a rope makes a clapper strike the side of its bell.

The secrets of this technique have passed from generation to generation, but by the 20th century this art was almost lost. Training took place only at workshops until 2008, then the first permanent traditional bell-ringing school opened in Moscow, under the leadership of [[Drozdihin Ilya]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tvkultura.ru/news.html?id=267190&amp;cid=178 |title=Russia. The TV channel "Culture". The school bell ringers opens in Moscow |publisher=Tvkultura.ru |date=2008-10-15 |accessdate=2014-06-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;
===Ellacombe apparatus===
The [[Ellacombe apparatus]] is an English mechanism devised for performing [[change ringing]] on [[church bell]]s by striking stationary bells with hammers. However it does not have the same sound as full circle ringing on the same bells  due to the absence of the Doppler effect as the bells do not rotate, and the lack of a damping effect of the clapper after each strike. As it requires considerable expertise for one person to ring changes on multiple bells, it is rarely used for change ringing, and usually a set sequence or a tune is played.

==Small-arc swinging==
The swinging of bells through a small arc of movement does not allow the ringer to control the speed of the bell striking. Thus a number of bells rung together in this way results in an uncoordinated sound as the bells each swing at their own speed dictated by the physics of a simple pendulum. Sometimes the bells are spaced out, and sometimes they strike simultaneously. This randomness also occurs with motorised bells ringing together. This a common method of ringing where full-circle bells do not exist, and requires little skill.

==Historical Hazards==
In the [[Middle Ages]], it was believed that the sound of a bell could disperse thunder.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=White|first=Andrew Dickson|authorlink=Andrew Dickson White|title=The Warfare of Science With Theology|year=1896|chapter=Chapter XI : From "The Prince Of The Power Of The Air" To Meteorology|url=http://www.infidels.org/library/historical/andrew_white/Chapter11.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; A large number of bell-ringers were electrocuted as a result. In France between the years 1753 and 1786, 103 bell-ringers were killed during thunderstorms as a result of holding on to wet bell ropes. The [[Parlement|Parlement of Paris]] enforced an edict in 1786 to prohibit the practice.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Burke | first = James | authorlink=James Burke (science historian) |title = Connections | publisher = Little, Brown | location = Boston | year = 1978 |page= 34| isbn = 0-316-11681-5 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Deaths likely continued until the 19th century, when the [[lightning rod]] came into general use.

'''''Blind Man's Bluff''''' (Spanish: '''''La gallina ciega''''') is one of the [[Rococo]] [[List of Francisco Goya's tapestry cartoons|oil-on-linen cartoons]] produced by the [[Spain|Spanish]] artist [[Francisco de Goya]] for tapestries for the [[Royal Palace of El Pardo]]. The work shows boys and girls playing the popular pastime "[[blind man's buff]]" with one figure in the middle blindfolded and holding a large spoon while trying to entice others dancing around him in a circle.

The children are dressed in the attire of Spanish aristocrats. Some wear velvet jackets and feather headdresses.

The picture is an example of Goya's Rococo period, and is typically lively and with a soft color scheme of pink and yellow in the skirts of women and luminous background scenery. As with many of his tapestry cartoons, it captures a charming moment of life.

'''Bohemian glass''', chiefly referred to as '''Bohemia crystal''', is [[glass]] produced in the regions of [[Bohemia]] and [[Silesia]], now parts of the [[Czech Republic]]. It has a centuries long history of being internationally recognised for its high quality, craftsmanship, beauty and often innovative designs. Hand-cut, engraved, blown and painted decorative glassware ranging from champagne flutes to enormous chandeliers, ornaments, figurines and other glass items are among the best known Czech exports and immensely popular as tourist souvenirs. The Czech Republic is home to numerous glass studios and schools attended by local and foreign students.

Oldest archaeological excavations of glass-making sites date to around 1250 and are located in the [[Lusatian Mountains]] of Northern Bohemia. Most notable Czech sites of glass-making throughout the ages are [[Skalice u České Lípy|Skalice]] ({{lang-de|Langenau}}), [[Jablonec nad Nisou]], [[Železný Brod]], [[Poděbrady]], [[Karlovy Vary]], [[Kamenický Šenov]] ({{lang-de|Steinschönau}}) and [[Nový Bor]] ({{lang-de|Haida}}). Several of these towns have their own glass museums with many items dating since around 1600. Jablonec nad Nisou in particular is famous for the local tradition of manufacturing glass costume jewellery. Its long history is documented by large collections in the Museum of Glass and Jewellery in Jablonec nad Nisou.

==Crystal vs. glass==
The meaning of crystal versus glass changes according to the country. The word "crystal" means, in most of the western world, the presence of [[lead]]. In the [[European Union]], labeling of "crystal" products is regulated by Council Directive 69/493/EEC, which defines four categories, depending on the chemical composition and properties of the material. Only glass products containing at least 24% of lead oxide may be referred to as "lead crystal". Products with less lead oxide, or glass products with other metal oxides used in place of lead oxide, must be labeled "crystallin" or "crystal glass".&lt;ref&gt;http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/en/ALL/;ELX_SESSIONID=l2btJx1QfVjGS26hd7RQHJT2pC6jtyHh219TZXbGQ3pPJZrSf8dP!-2071614142?uri=CELEX:31969L0493&lt;/ref&gt; In the United States it is the opposite - glass is defined as "crystal" if it contains only 1% lead. In the Czech Republic, the term "crystal" is used for any exquisite, high quality glass. Leaded crystal means crystal containing more than 24% lead oxide.

The presence of lead in crystal softens the glass and makes it more accessible for cutting and engraving. Lead increases the weight of the glass and causes the glass to diffract light. Glass can contain up to 40% lead, if maximum hardness is desired. On the other hand, crystal can contain less than 24% lead if it has a high proportion of barium oxide, which ensures high quality light diffraction.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ecrystal.cz/en/czech-crystal/&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
[[Bohemia]], a part of the Czech Republic (formerly part of [[Czechoslovakia]], formerly part of the [[Austro-Hungarian Empire]], originally part of [[Czech Kingdom]] or [[Kingdom of Bohemia]]), became famous for its beautiful and colourful glass during the [[Renaissance]]. The history of Bohemian glass started with the abundant natural resources found in the countryside.

Bohemian glass-workers discovered [[potash]] combined with chalk created a clear colourless glass that was more stable than glass from Italy. In the 16th century the term Bohemian crystal was used for the first time to distinguish its qualities from glass made elsewhere. This glass contained no lead as is commonly suspected. This Czech glass could be cut with a wheel. In addition, resources such as wood for firing the kilns and for burning down to ashes were used to create [[potash]]. There were also copious amounts of [[limestone]] and [[silica]]. In the 17th century, [[Caspar Lehmann]], [[Gemstone|gem]] cutter to [[Emperor Rudolf II]] in [[Prague]], adapted to glass the technique of gem engraving with [[copper]] and [[bronze]] wheels. During the era, the Czech lands became the dominant producer of decorative glassware and the local manufacture of glass earned international reputation in high [[Baroque]] style from 1685 to 1750.

Czech glassware became as prestigious as jewellery and was sought-after by the wealthy and the aristocracy of the time. Czech crystal chandeliers could be found in the palaces of the French king [[Louis XV]], [[Maria Theresa]], Empress of Austria, and  [[Elizabeth of Russia]].

Bohemia turned out expert craftsmen who artfully worked with crystal. Bohemian crystal became famous for its excellent cut and engraving. They became skilled teachers of glass-making in neighbouring and distant countries. By the middle of the 19th century, a technical glass-making school system was created that encouraged traditional and innovative techniques as well as thorough technical preparation.

In the second half of the 19th century, Bohemia looked to the export trade and mass-produced coloured glass that was exported all over the world. Pairs of vases were produced either in a single colour of opaque glass or in two-colour cased glass. These were decorated in thickly enamelled flower subjects that were painted with great speed. Others were decorated with coloured lithographic prints copying famous paintings. These glass objects were made in huge quantities in large factories and were available by mail order throughout Europe and America. Many of them were not fine art but provided inexpensive decorative objects to brighten up ordinary homes. [[Reverse glass painting]] was also a Czech specialty. The image is carefully painted by hand on the back of a pane of glass, using a variety of techniques and materials, after which the painting is mounted in a bevelled wooden frame.

Glass [[artisan]]ship remained at a high level even under the [[Czechoslovak Socialist Republic|Communists]] because it was considered ideologically innocuous and it helped promote the good name of the country. Czech glass designers and manufacturers enjoyed international recognition and Czech glassware including art works such as sculptures was displayed and awarded in many international exhibitions, most notably in [[Expo 58]] world fair in [[Brussels]] and in [[Expo 67]] in [[Montréal]].

Today, Czech crystal chandeliers hang, for example, in [[Milan]]'s [[La Scala]], in [[Rome]]'s [[Teatro dell'Opera]], in [[Palace of Versailles|Versailles]], in the [[Hermitage Museum]] in [[St. Petersburg]] or in the royal palace in [[Riyadh]]. Various sorts of glassware, art glass, ornaments, figurines, costume jewellery, beads and others also remain internationally valued.

One of the glass items for which the Czech nation is still well known is the production of "druk" beads. Druks are small (3mm-18mm) round glass beads with small threading holes produced in a wide variety of colors and finishes and used mainly as spacers among beaded jewellery makers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book

'''''Bush Mechanics''''' is a 2001 television [[documentary film|documentary]] series directed by David Batty and produced by the [[Warlpiri Media Association]], featuring an [[Indigenous Australians|Indigenous Australian]] take on motor mechanics.

A [[bush mechanic]], in Australian parlance, is someone who uses unorthodox techniques and readily available materials to build or fix mechanical problems.&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.is/20130917123046/http://www.bushmechanics.com/pages/what_is.htm Bush Mechanics definition]&lt;/ref&gt; An American analogue would be the television show character [[MacGyver]] who shares similar resourceful and lateral-cognitive traits. The television show featured Aboriginal people from [[Yuendumu]] fixing cars in such a way as they travelled through Central Australia. As they traverse the desert in their dilapidated vehicles, the series followed how they solved multiple car problems with inventive, wacky and unpredictable [[The Bush|bush]] repair techniques.

One example from the series (episode one) involved a [[station wagon]] with the band's equipment on the roof. Since the car was very old, the back half collapsed. They then removed the roof of the car with an [[axe]], turned it upside down, and tied it to the back of the car, loaded the items from the roof onto the same roof--but it is now used as a trailer. They continued down the sandy [[trail|track]] dragging the roof behind them. 

The television show consisted of five episodes: one initial half-hour documentary, which garnered international recognition, and four subsequent episodes. It was first broadcast by [[ABC Television]] (Australia) on 2 October 2001.

The episodes included:

* Motorcar Ngutju (Good Motorcar)
* Payback
* The Chase
* The Rainmakers

Language:
The series is notable for being one of the first media to be in an Aboriginal language as much of the dialog is in [[Warlpiri language|Warlpiri]] and [[Australian Kriol language|Kriol]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Some Australian Indigenous languages you should know|url=http://theconversation.com/some-australian-indigenous-languages-you-should-know-40155|last=Meakins|first=Felicity|publisher=Australian Research Council (ARC), Aboriginals Benefit Account (ABA) and the Australian Institute of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Studies (AIATSIS)|date=7 May 2015|accessdate=27 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Crab on its Back''''' ({{lang-nl|Een op zijn rug liggende krab}}) is an [[oil painting]] by [[Vincent van Gogh]]. It is a [[still life]] of a [[crab]] lying on its back with a green background. The [[Van Gogh Museum]] dates the work to August-September 1887,&lt;ref name="vgm"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.vangoghmuseum.nl/en/collection/s0124V1962|title=A Crab on its Back - Van Gogh Museum|website=www.vangoghmuseum.nl|language=en|access-date=2018-10-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; while other sources date it to early 1889.&lt;ref&gt;For example, [https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=gdkn6yCOi6sC&amp;pg=PA155 Vincent van Gogh], Victoria Charles, p.155&lt;/ref&gt; The painting is in the permanent collection of the [[Van Gogh Museum]] in [[Amsterdam]] in the [[Netherlands]].&lt;ref name="vgm"/&gt;

The painting is possibly inspired by a Japanese print of a crab by [[Hokusai]] that Van Gogh had seen in the magazine ''[[Le Japon Artistique]]'', which his brother [[Theo van Gogh (art dealer)|Theo van Gogh]] had sent him in September 1888.&lt;ref name="vgm" /&gt;&lt;ref name="nationalgallery"/&gt;

Both the fountain and Millennium Park are highly accessible because of their [[universal design]].&lt;ref name=PVA/&gt;

''Crown Fountain'' has been one of the most controversial of all the Millennium Park features.  Before it was even built, some were concerned that the sculpture's height violated the aesthetic tradition of the park.  After construction, surveillance cameras were installed atop the fountain, which led to a public outcry (and their quick removal).

However, the fountain has survived its contentious beginnings to find its way into Chicago pop culture.  It is a popular subject for photographers and a common gathering place.  While some of the videos displayed are of scenery, most attention has focused on its video clips of local residents. The fountain is a public play area and offers people an escape from summer heat, allowing children  to frolic in the fountain's water.&lt;ref name=NSaHHTD/&gt;

==Concept and design==
{{Millennium Park Map}}
[[Grant Park (Chicago)|Grant Park]], which is between [[Lake Michigan]] and the [[central business district]], is commonly called "Chicago's Front Yard".&lt;ref name=CtfoinfyMPptt/&gt;&lt;ref name=IafoGPCmfasr/&gt;  Its northwest corner had been [[Illinois Central Railroad|Illinois Central]] rail yards and parking lots until 1997, when it was made available for development by the city as [[Millennium Park]].&lt;ref name=MPNYT&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2006/08/06/books/chapters/0806-1st-gilf.html|title=Millennium Park|accessdate=June 24, 2008|date=August 6, 2006|publisher=[[The New York Times Company]]|work=[[The New York Times]]|author=Gilfoyle, Timothy J.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Millennium Park was conceived in 1998 as the capstone of Grant Park, to celebrate the new millennium and to feature world-renowned architects, artists, designers, landscape architects, and urban planners.&lt;ref name=PVA/&gt; As of 2007, Millennium Park trails only [[Navy Pier]] as a Chicago tourist attraction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Crain's List Lartgest Tourist Attractions (Sightseeing): Ranked by 2007 attendance|date=June 23, 2008|page=22|publisher=[[Crain Communications Inc.]]|work=Crain's Chicago Business}}&lt;/ref&gt; The fountain is centrally located in Chicago: it is east of [[Michigan Avenue (Chicago)|Michigan Avenue]] and its [[Historic Michigan Boulevard District]], north of Monroe Street and the [[Art Institute of Chicago]]; and south of Madison Street.

===Selection of artist===
In December 1999, [[Lester Crown]] and his family agreed to sponsor a [[water feature]] in [[Millennium Park]].  Unlike other park feature sponsors, the Crowns acted independently of Millennium Park officials; they conducted independent surveys of water technologies, held their own informal design contest, and stayed active in the design and engineering of the project.&lt;ref name=Gilfoyle27880&gt;Gilfoyle, pp. 278–280.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Crowns were open-minded about the choice of artist; wanting a modern work, they solicited proposals from a list of prospective artists and architects.&lt;ref name=Gilfoyle27880/&gt; Jaume Plensa researched the traditions and history of fountains and studied [[anthropomorphism]] in fountain imagery.&lt;ref name=G287/&gt;  Some of his early ideas for the project referenced [[Buckingham Fountain]], but these were soon abandoned.&lt;ref name=G288&gt;Gilfoyle, p. 288.&lt;/ref&gt; His presentation to the Crown family started with a slide show of fountains from the [[Middle Ages]] through the 20th&amp;nbsp;century.  Plensa focused on the philosophical meanings associated with fountains, their history, use and art.&lt;ref name=G287&gt;Gilfoyle, p. 287.&lt;/ref&gt;  His presentation included [[computer animation]] of facial expressions.&lt;ref name=MFHtMPfdeadcSHFahocCtpotaatm/&gt; The other finalists were [[Maya Lin]], who presented a low-height horizontal form, and [[Robert Venturi]], who presented a fountain that would have been {{convert|150|ft|m}} tall.&lt;ref name=G280/&gt; In January 2000, Plensa won the commission to design the fountain over Lin and Venturi.&lt;ref name=WotwAJPrtfft2c/&gt;&lt;ref name=G280&gt;Gilfoyle, p. 280.&lt;/ref&gt;  The installation is a video sculpture, commissioned to operate thirty years.&lt;ref name=JMSAN&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.uiowa.edu/jmc/alumni/index.html |title=J-MC School Alumni News |accessdate=August 6, 2008 |date=August 26, 2004 |publisher=School of Journalism &amp; Mass Communication, The University of Iowa |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080804220905/http://www.uiowa.edu/jmc/alumni/index.html |archivedate=August 4, 2008 |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;!--   What is the boundary on spelling out numbers ??

===Artistic design===
[[File:20080517 Crown Fountain towers from overhead.jpg|thumb|Opposing {{convert|50|ft|m|adj=on}} towers represent Plensa's dualism [[Theme (visual arts)|theme]].|alt=View of the fountain shows glass brick towers from rooftop nearby.]]
[[File:Crown Fountain - silhouettes.jpg|thumb|right|Tourists often interact with the fountain by silhouetting themselves against the fountain's lighting at night.|alt=Tourists silhouette themselves against the fountain's lighting at night.]]
Prior to ''Crown Fountain'', Plensa's dominant theme had been dualism,&lt;ref&gt;Gilfoyle, p. 282.&lt;/ref&gt; which he had expanded to artworks in which the viewers are outside, and the visible subjects of the art are inside containers and hollow spaces.  In the 1990s, he completed several outdoor sculptures in which he explored the use of light (''The Star of David'' (1998) at [[Stockholm]]'s Raoul Wallenberg Square, ''Bridge of Light'' (1998) in Jerusalem), and  LED technology, video, and computer design (''Gläserne Seele &amp; Mr. Net'' in Brandenburg (1999–2000)).&lt;ref&gt;Gilfoyle, p. 283.&lt;/ref&gt;  In his public art, Plensa challenged himself to involve the viewer with his art, which led to his conception of the ''Crown Fountain''.&lt;ref name=G287/&gt;  His objective  was to create a socially relevant, interactive  fountain for the 21st&amp;nbsp;century.&lt;ref name=G285&gt;Gilfoyle, p. 285.&lt;/ref&gt;  Since water is the focus of a fountain, and since Chicago, and especially Millennium Park, is so greatly affected by the nearby waterfront, Plensa sought to create an eternal water work to complement the local natural inspirations.&lt;ref name=G288/&gt; Because of the colder winters common to the [[climate of Chicago]], Plensa created a fountain that would remain vibrant when the water was inactive in the wintertime, so the fountain is an experience of light themes and the use of video technology.&lt;ref name=G288/&gt;

Plensa explores dualism with ''Crown Fountain'', where he has two randomly selected faces "conversing" with each other.&lt;ref name=BSBDBA/&gt; Plensa feels that by using faces, he can represent the diversity of the city both in ethnicity and in age.&lt;ref name=Hystf&gt;{{cite web|url=http://docs.newsbank.com/openurl?ctx_ver=z39.88-2004&amp;rft_id=info:sid/iw.newsbank.com:NewsBank:CSTB&amp;rft_val_format=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:ctx&amp;rft_dat=119F8FEDC3E36068&amp;svc_dat=InfoWeb:aggregated5&amp;req_dat=AA98CDC331574F0ABEAFF732B33DC0B2 |title= Have you seen this face?; Many have yet to see their own images |publisher=NewsBank |work=Chicago Sun-Times|date=June 24, 2007 |accessdate=April 22, 2008 |author=Nance, Kevin}}&lt;/ref&gt; The artist intends to portray the [[sociocultural evolution]] of the city by updating the collection of images.&lt;ref name=Artropolis/&gt;  His representation has become a part of the city's  pop culture; the first few episodes of the first season of ''[[Prison Break]]'' featured shots of the fountain.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.timeout.com/chicago/articles/features/12287/big-house-on-the-prairie |title=Big house on the prairie: TOC goes behind bars for a preview of Prison Break, an arresting TV drama serving time on location around Chicago |accessdate=August 8, 2008 |date=August 24, 2005 |publisher=Time Out Chicago |author=Lyons, Margaret |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090210132409/http://www.timeout.com/chicago/articles/features/12287/big-house-on-the-prairie |archivedate=February 10, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Plensa feels that the challenge in the creation of successful work of [[public art]] is to integrate the viewer into an interactive relationship with the art.&lt;ref name=G285/&gt;  The fountain is known for encouraging its visitors to splash and slide in the reflecting pool, jostle for position under the water spout and place themselves under the cascade.&lt;ref name=CarNoosrcbapc/&gt;&lt;ref name=NSaHHTD/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://docs.newsbank.com/openurl?ctx_ver=z39.88-2004&amp;rft_id=info:sid/iw.newsbank.com:NewsBank:CTRB&amp;rft_val_format=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:ctx&amp;rft_dat=104039DBC0769388&amp;svc_dat=InfoWeb:aggregated5&amp;req_dat=AA98CDC331574F0ABEAFF732B33DC0B2|title=Park is awash in art that raises ageless queries|accessdate=August 5, 2008|date=July 23, 2004|publisher=Newsbank|work=[[Chicago Tribune]]|author=Schmich, Mary}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=AAGPoCF&gt;{{cite web|url=http://travel.nytimes.com/2007/11/04/travel/04frugal.html|title=Amid Architectural Glories, Piles of Cheap Fun |publisher=The New York Times Company|work=[[The New York Times]]|date= November 4, 2007|author=Gross, Matt|accessdate=July 28, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This interactivity was to some degree accidental.  Although the city planned for some interactivity, the transformation of the fountain into a water park for kids within hours of opening surprised Plensa.&lt;ref name=G291/&gt;  Now, when the [[National Weather Service]] issues summer [[heat advisory|heat advisories]] and the [[Governor of Illinois]] declares state office buildings as official daytime [[cooling center]]s, the national press points to ''Crown Fountain'' as a respite for inhabitants of the [[Chicago metropolitan area]].&lt;ref name=NSaHHTD&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2006/07/18/us/18sizzle.html|title=Nation Sweats as Heat Hits Triple Digits|publisher=The New York Times Company|work=[[The New York Times]]|accessdate=July 28, 2008|date=July 18, 2006|author=Steinhauer, Jennifer}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Video production===
Approximately 75 ethnic, social, and religious Chicago organizations were asked to provide candidates whose faces would be photographed for integration into the fountain.&lt;ref name=s85/&gt; The subjects were chosen from local schools, churches and community groups, and filming began in 2001 at the downtown campus of the [[School of the Art Institute of Chicago]] (SAIC). The SAIC students filmed their subjects with a $100,000 high-definition [[HDW-F900]] [[video camera]], the same model used in the production of the three ''[[Star Wars]]'' prequels.&lt;ref name=MFHtMPfdeadcSHFahocCtpotaatm/&gt;&lt;ref name=MPfpibffSmaahvsgfadr/&gt; About 20 SAIC students took part in what became an informal master's course in [[public art]] for the project.&lt;ref name=s85&gt;Sharoff, p. 85&lt;/ref&gt; Faculty from [[Columbia College Chicago]] was also involved in the production of the video.&lt;ref name=JMSAN/&gt; The high-definition equipment was used because of the scale of the project.&lt;ref name=MFHtMPfdeadcSHFahocCtpotaatm/&gt;  Because the image proportions were like a [[movie screen]] with a width far exceeding its height, the camera was turned on its side during filming.&lt;ref name=s85/&gt;

Each face appears on the sculpture for a total of 5&amp;nbsp;minutes using various parts of individual 80-second videos.&lt;ref name=MFHtMPfdeadcSHFahocCtpotaatm/&gt; A 40-second section is played at one-third speed forward and backward, running for a total of 4&amp;nbsp;minutes.&lt;ref name=Hystf/&gt; Then, there is a subsequent segment, where the mouth is puckering, that is stretched to 15&amp;nbsp;seconds.  This is followed by a section, in which the water appears to spout from the open mouth, that is stretched to last for 30&amp;nbsp;seconds.  Finally, there is a smile after the completion of the water spouting from the mouth, that is slowed to extend for 15&amp;nbsp;seconds.&lt;ref name=MFHtMPfdeadcSHFahocCtpotaatm/&gt; Of the original 1,051&amp;nbsp;subjects filmed, 960&amp;nbsp;videos were determined to be usable for the project.&lt;ref name=Hystf/&gt; Originally, the set of images was presumed to be the beginning of a work in progress, but as of 2009 no additional videos are planned.&lt;ref name=s85/&gt;

To achieve the effect in which water appears to be flowing from subjects' mouths, each video has a segment where the subject's lips are puckered, which is then timed to correspond to the spouting water, reminiscent of [[gargoyle]] fountains.&lt;ref name=Artropolis/&gt;&lt;ref name=CDoCA/&gt; &lt;!-- I can not find a source to back up this claim: A remote control system, designed by multimedia consultants [[Shen Milsom &amp; Wilke]] synchronizes images, water flow, and lighting color and intensity. --&gt;Each face is cropped so that no hair and usually no ears are visible.&lt;ref name=MFHtMPfdeadcSHFahocCtpotaatm/&gt; Since there is no tripod designed for cameras turned on their sides,&lt;ref name=s85/&gt; an adjustable barber/dentist's chair was used to minimize the need for the movement of the state-of-the-art camera during filming.&lt;ref name=Hystf/&gt;&lt;ref name=MFHtMPfdeadcSHFahocCtpotaatm/&gt; Nonetheless, in some case, digital manipulation was necessary to properly simulate puckering in the exact proper location on the video.&lt;ref name=BSBDBA/&gt;  Many of the faces had to be stretched in order to get the mouths properly positioned.&lt;ref name=MFHtMPfdeadcSHFahocCtpotaatm/&gt;  Additionally, each video was color-corrected for brightness, contrast and color saturation.  Both the playback equipment and the final videos had to be further adjusted to account for sunlight during viewing.&lt;ref name=MFHtMPfdeadcSHFahocCtpotaatm/&gt;

After two architectural firms refused the contract to make Plensa's design a reality, the firm [[Krueck and Sexton Architects]] accepted. Public art was a departure from Krueck &amp; Sexton's residential and corporate office-dominated portfolio, which includes buildings like the [[Spertus Institute]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author= Baeb, Eddie |date= September 7, 2007 |title = No Small Plans for Design Duo |journal = [[Crain's Chicago Business]] |volume = 30 |issue = 28 |pages = 1–8 |issn = 0149-6956}}&lt;/ref&gt; Collaboration between the artist, architectural team, and consultants proved to be crucial to the success of the project.  The fountain's black granite reflecting pool measures {{convert|48|by|232|ft|m}} and has an approximate water depth of {{convert|0.25|in|mm}}.&lt;ref name=Artropolis/&gt;  It displays videos on two [[LED]] screens, each encapsulated in a glass brick tower measuring {{convert|50|by|23|by|16|ft|m}}.&lt;ref name=Artropolis/&gt; &lt;!-- This would be a good place to insert the distance between towers - is it 232 feet? --&gt;The firm designed a special [[stainless steel]] T-frame both to bear the load of the walls, which are {{convert|50|ft|m}} high, and to withstand lateral wind forces.

After several dozen glass manufacturing firms were interviewed, L. E. Smith Glass Company emerged as the company to produce 22,500&amp;nbsp;glass blocks near the upper limit of the size of press glass formed from hand-poured molten glass and [[cast iron]] molds.&lt;ref name=s75&gt;Sharoff, 75&lt;/ref&gt;  The process used sand and [[soda ash]] heated to a temperature of {{convert|2600|F|C}} and "gathered" with a large clay ball resembling a [[honey dipper]]. Rather than use a standard plunger to ensure the glass that sagged off the rod spread to the corners of the mold, they relied on gravity.  The full mold was [[Annealing (glass)|annealed]] (reheated in an oven to {{convert|1100|F|C}}) and cooled.&lt;ref name=s76&gt;Sharoff, 76&lt;/ref&gt;  Over the course of four months of production,&lt;ref name=s79&gt;Sharoff, p. 79&lt;/ref&gt; about 350 blocks were produced per day.&lt;ref name=s76/&gt;

The glass was custom-made at a factory in [[Mount Pleasant, Pennsylvania]], and shipped to the structural glass panel manufacturer in Melbourne, Florida.  The panels were then shipped by truck to Chicago. The glass is white glass, rather than the usual green glass that results from [[iron]] impurities. This has the tradeoff of increased image clarity, but greater dirt visibility. Each block is {{convert|5|by|10|by|2|in|mm}} with glass thin enough to avoid image distortion. On each block, one of the six faces is polished, and the other five surfaces are textured.&lt;ref name=AT/&gt;&lt;ref name=awdoa/&gt;

The structure for the blocks was a challenge.  At first, the design team had considered switching to plastic blocks, until the team found Circle Redmont Inc., a prefabricated glass panel company in [[Melbourne, Florida|Melbourne]], Florida which specializes in structural glass panel systems.  Circle Redmont came up with the plan of turning grates on their sides to be used as building elements.&lt;ref name=s79/&gt; The individual grids are {{convert|5|ft|m}} tall and either {{convert|16|ft|m}} or {{convert|23|ft|m}} wide with cell capacity of an average of 250 blocks.&lt;ref name=s79/&gt;  Each tower is composed of 44 grids stacked and welded.&lt;ref name=s79/&gt;  The combination of the [[refraction]] of the glass and the thinness of the metal make the grid virtually invisible.&lt;ref name=s79/&gt;

The fountain uses {{convert|11000|impgal|L}} per hour, 97% of which is recycled back into the system.&lt;ref name=s86&gt;Sharoff, p. 86&lt;/ref&gt;  Getting the water to the spout took ingenuity. Although consideration was given to omitting a LED tile, it was determined that the images would then look as though they were each missing a tooth. Instead, one tile in each tower is recessed about {{convert|6|in|mm}} to allow the installation of {{convert|1|in|mm}} clear tubing for the water nozzle.&lt;ref name=AT/&gt; The water regularly spills over the fountain and down the sides of the towers and intermittently spouts from the nozzle.&lt;ref name=AT/&gt; Two essential custom fittings contribute to the artistic vision of the fountain: a custom glass block at the upper edge for guiding the water's descent while remaining unobtrusive, and a plastic nozzle fitted to the stainless steel frame to control the rate of water flow and reduce liability to the city for any injuries sustained by the fountain's interactive participants.&lt;ref name=G291/&gt;&lt;ref name=awdoa /&gt; The interactive participants are usually children playing in the stream from the water spout or under the cascade.&lt;ref name=NSaHHTD/&gt; The risk that the spouting water would knock people down made the design both a legal and a physical challenge.&lt;ref name=awdoa /&gt;

The fountains use over one million LEDs.&lt;ref name=G277&gt;Gilfoyle, p. 277.&lt;/ref&gt;  The inner surface of each tower uses 147 smaller screens with a total of 264,480 LED points (each with two red, one blue and two green LEDs).&lt;ref name=s82&gt;Sharoff, p. 82&lt;/ref&gt; The physical demands of LED screens, in particular the red, green, and blue long-life light bulbs and the requisite [[circuitry]], created three major challenges: supporting the physical structure, combating heat buildup, and optimizing perceptibility of the display.&lt;ref name=awdoa /&gt;  Plensa had used LED fixtures on previous projects, and thus had some experience with these issues.&lt;ref name=CsCFuLlad/&gt;  The LED structure is not supported as a single wall (which would be {{convert|50|ft|m}} high), but rather as several segments that are noticeable as visible horizontal bands every few feet: these show where the LED equipment is supported. The heat generated is handled by fans that cool the air at the bottom, that then works its way through the chimney-like tower. Perceptibility was determined to be optimal with [[LED lights]] {{convert|2|in|mm}} behind the glass.&lt;ref name=awdoa /&gt;

LEDs were chosen because they were viewed as the lowest maintenance option of the possible color changing fixtures.&lt;ref name=CsCFuLlad/&gt; LEDs fit into an electrical circuit, causing illumination by the movement of [[electron]]s in the [[semiconductor]] material and making a [[Electrical filament|filament]] unnecessary, so the bulbs never burn out and do not get too hot.  Fins were added to the screens to keep direct sunlight from hitting the LEDs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://twistedphysics.typepad.com/cocktail_party_physics/2007/08/park-walk-par-1.html|title=A Walk in the Park: Part III|work=Architecture, Art, Optics|publisher=Cocktail Party Physics|accessdate=December 18, 2007|date=August 7, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Color Kinetics (now part of [[Philips Solid-State Lighting Solutions]], which is now called Philips Color Kinetics)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release|url=http://origin.newscenter.philips.com/about/news/article-15801.page |title=Philips to acquire Color Kinetics to strengthen leading position in Led lighting systems, components and technologies |accessdate=July 27, 2008 |date=June 19, 2007 |publisher=Koninklijke Philips Electronics N.V. |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20090306082618/http://origin.newscenter.philips.com/about/news/article-15801.page |archivedate=March 6, 2009 |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt; ColorBlast&amp;nbsp;12 LEDs  fixtures are used to illuminate the tower structures and glass in an attempt to meet Plensa's objective that the towers have a light and translucent appearance, with their internal structures reflecting light from behind the glass surface.  The electronics were designed to be adaptable to the time of day, weather and season and to meet the desired century-long longevity and dependability objectives set by the design team in response to the thirty-year directive.&lt;ref name=CsCFuLlad/&gt;

The {{convert|9423|sqft|m2|adj=on}} pool used {{convert|3|by|3|ft|m}} [[Paver (flooring)|paver]]s that weigh {{convert|250|lb|kg}}.&lt;ref name=s86/&gt;  The pavers were rested on [[screw jack]] pedestals in order to be leveled and shimmed.&lt;ref name=s86/&gt;  The pavers had to be perfectly leveled for the water to work correctly because the fountain incorporates numerous sensors to regulate the flow and level of the water.&lt;ref name=s86/&gt;

During construction the underground parking garage remained open.&lt;ref&gt;Sharoff, p. 70&lt;/ref&gt; An additional challenge was designing the structure to facilitate interior access for ongoing maintenance and repairs, while accommodating two levels of underground parking underneath. The challenge was solved by combining a T-bar grid to absorb weight with about 150&amp;nbsp;"outriggers", or "tiebacks", inserted through the video wall to support the glass blocks and absorb wind loads. This design allows for the removal of individual glass blocks for cleaning or repair without disruption to the display. The filtered air inside the towers helps minimize the need for cleaning.&lt;ref name=AT/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |date=December 2006 |title = A Technical Cocktail |journal = Glass Age |volume = 49 |issue = 12 |pages = 15 |issn = 0017-0992}}&lt;/ref&gt;  ''Crown Fountain'''s design not only included interior access for technical repairs, but also incorporated exemplary, non-discriminatory, [[barrier-free]] accessibility, because its interactivity is not limited to the able-bodied.

===Operation===
The control center for the synchronization of images, water flow, and lighting color and intensity is beneath one of the towers, in a room that covers {{convert|550|sqft|m2}}. The room houses [[high-definition video]] servers and equipment temperature sensors. Hard drives contain all the individual electronic computer files of the face videos. Generally, the computer programs automatically perform tasks such as determining when the face will pucker and, if weather conditions permit, when to turn the water on and off. Using low- rather than high-[[Image resolution|resolution]] images was both less expensive and created a better display for the average viewer.&lt;ref name=AT/&gt; A [[Barco (manufacturer)|Barco]] [[show control]]ler selects the sequence of faces one at a time and determines a random tower lighting selection of one of eight LED colors programmed into an [[Electronic Theatre Controls]] (ETC) Emphasis control system.&lt;ref name=CsCFuLlad/&gt;  At night, the ETC system controls [[Stage lighting|spotlight]]s that illuminate the cascading water and that are dimmed by special wet-use location [[ground fault circuit interrupter]]s.&lt;ref name=CsCFuLlad/&gt;  The control room covers an area equal to 26&amp;nbsp;parking spaces in the underground parking garage, which costs the city $100,000 annually in terms of the [[opportunity cost]] of lost revenue (in 2004&amp;nbsp;dollars).&lt;ref name=BSBDBA&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2004/07/18/arts/art-architecture-big-shoulders-big-donors-big-art.html|title= Big Shoulders, Big Donors, Big Art|accessdate=June 1, 2008|date=July 18, 2004|author=Bernstein, Fred A.|publisher=The New York Times Company|work=[[The New York Times]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Maintenance issues for the fountain range from kids removing the adhesive between the bricks to pipes in need of maintenance.&lt;ref name=AitaCFrawoq/&gt;  {{Asof|2014}}, annual upkeep costs were approximately $400,000.&lt;ref name=":1"/&gt; Typically, the fountain's water features function between mid-spring and mid-fall, but the images remain on the screen year-round.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://urbanmatter.com/chicago/crown-fountain-reopens/ |title=Play In The Spray: Crown Fountain Reopens Mid-April|accessdate= Mar 7, 2017 |author=Quero, Sam}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Video sculpture====
The  front face of each tower is [[animation|animated]] with a continuous, dynamic exhibit of lights and electronic images.&lt;ref name=Artropolis/&gt; Although the screens on the towers periodically display clips of [[landscape]]s such as  waterfalls,  most intriguing  are the display of faces of Chicago residents. About 1,000&amp;nbsp;faces of Chicagoans are shown in a random rotation,&lt;ref name=AT/&gt; the order determined using a Barco show controller.&lt;ref name=CsCFuLlad/&gt; Each face is displayed for five minutes, with a brief period between each of these videos during which the sculpture is unlit.  As a result, no more than 12 faces appear per hour during the summer.  However, during the winter a version without the final one minute of puckering is shown, so the video segments then are only four minutes each.&lt;ref name=Hystf/&gt;&lt;ref name=MFHtMPfdeadcSHFahocCtpotaatm/&gt;  The video pattern also includes a three-minute water scene every half-hour and a 30-second fade-to-black every 15 minutes.  If all the faces were shown consecutively, instead of randomly, they would each appear about once every eight days.&lt;ref name=Hystf/&gt; A June 2007 article in the ''Chicago Sun-Times'' reported that many of the subjects who had their images [[digital image|digitized]] for the project had yet to either see their own images or hear of anyone who had seen them.&lt;ref name=Hystf/&gt;

[[Image:20070616 Crown Fountain (6).JPG|thumb|left|Every 15 minutes the LEDs fade to black and there is a brief pause between individual videos.|alt=The fountain during a periodic fade to black]]
The spouting water from the  faces of the towers appears to be flowing from the displayed subject's mouth from a {{convert|6|in|mm|adj=on}} nozzle located in the center of each interior face {{convert|12|ft|m}} above the reflecting pool.&lt;ref name=MFHtMPfdeadcSHFahocCtpotaatm/&gt; Images are shown daily year-round, while the water feature only operates from May 1 to approximately October 31,&lt;ref name="Frequently Asked Questions"/&gt; weather permitting.&lt;ref name=CDoCA&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.millenniumpark.org/artandarchitecture/crown_fountain.html |accessdate=June 13, 2007 |publisher=Chicago Department of Cultural Affairs |title=The Crown Fountain |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070608095149/http://www.millenniumpark.org/artandarchitecture/crown_fountain.html &lt;!--Added by H3llBot--&gt; |archivedate=June 8, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The park is open to the public daily from 6&amp;nbsp;a.m. to 11&amp;nbsp;p.m.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.millenniumpark.org/generalinformation/|accessdate=August 3, 2008|publisher=City of Chicago|title=Millennium Park: General Information|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080730174640/http://www.millenniumpark.org/generalinformation/ &lt;!--Added by H3llBot--&gt;|archivedate=July 30, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Each tower is illuminated from within on three sides by approximately 70&amp;nbsp;color-changing [[Color Kinetics]] LED lighting fixtures per tower, while the fourth side features opposing Barco LED display screens.  At night, some of the videos are replaced by images of nature or solid colors.&lt;ref name=CsCFuLlad&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ledsmagazine.com/features/2/5/3|title=Chicago's stunning Crown Fountain uses LED lights and displays|accessdate=March 18, 2008|date=May 2005|publisher=PennWell Corporation|work=LEDs Magazine}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also at night, the other three sides of the fountain display changing colors.&lt;ref name=G277/&gt;  The outer Color Kinetics surfaces randomly display the [[translucent]] glow of one of eight colors along with each of the inner opposing faces.&lt;ref name=CsCFuLlad/&gt;  As a [[video sculpture]] with a variety of cascade and water spout fountain modes, the sculpture is a fluid, dynamic evolving artwork.&lt;ref name=G291/&gt;

==Controversies==
Before the fountain was completed in 2004, Art Institute of Chicago president James Wood felt the columns would be too tall and other community leaders felt that the height and scale of the project stemmed from a "pissing contest" with other park feature artists.&lt;ref name=G290-1&gt;Gilfoyle, pp. 290–291.&lt;/ref&gt; Grant Park has been protected since 1836 by "forever open, clear and free" legislation that has been affirmed by four previous [[Illinois Supreme Court]] rulings.&lt;ref name=IafoGPCmfasr&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.economist.com/world/unitedstates/displaystory.cfm?story_id=9905732|title=In a fight over Grant Park, Chicago's mayor faces a small revolt |accessdate=July 31, 2008|date=October 4, 2007|publisher= The Economist Newspaper Limited|work=[[The Economist]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://docs.newsbank.com/openurl?ctx_ver=z39.88-2004&amp;rft_id=info:sid/iw.newsbank.com:NewsBank:CSTB&amp;rft_val_format=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:ctx&amp;rft_dat=121435C3FB5CE640&amp;svc_dat=InfoWeb:aggregated5&amp;req_dat=AA98CDC331574F0ABEAFF732B33DC0B2|title=Mayor gets what he wants&amp;mdash;Council OKs move 33&amp;ndash;16 despite opposition|accessdate=July 29, 2008|date=June 12, 2008|publisher=Newsbank|work=Chicago Sun-Times|author=Spielman, Fran}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://docs.newsbank.com/openurl?ctx_ver=z39.88-2004&amp;rft_id=info:sid/iw.newsbank.com:NewsBank:CTRB&amp;rft_val_format=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:ctx&amp;rft_dat=1212F083B836ABB8&amp;svc_dat=InfoWeb:aggregated5&amp;req_dat=AA98CDC331574F0ABEAFF732B33DC0B2|title=The taking of Grant Park|accessdate=July 29, 2008|date=June 8, 2008|publisher=Newsbank|work=[[Chicago Tribune]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://docs.newsbank.com/openurl?ctx_ver=z39.88-2004&amp;rft_id=info:sid/iw.newsbank.com:NewsBank:CSTB&amp;rft_val_format=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:ctx&amp;rft_dat=120B5E8D060726E0&amp;svc_dat=InfoWeb:aggregated5&amp;req_dat=AA98CDC331574F0ABEAFF732B33DC0B2|title=13&amp;ndash;2 vote for museum&amp;mdash;Decision on Grant Park sets up Council battle|accessdate=July 29, 2008|date=May 16, 2008|publisher=Newsbank|work=Chicago Sun-Times|author=Spielman, Fran and Art Golab}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Aaron Montgomery Ward]] twice sued the city of Chicago in the 1890s to force it to remove buildings and structures from Grant Park, and to keep it from building new ones.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.encyclopedia.chicagohistory.org/pages/538.html|title=Grant Park|accessdate=July 28, 2008|year=2005|work=The Electronic Encyclopedia of Chicago|publisher=[[Chicago Historical Society]]|author=Grinnell, Max}}&lt;/ref&gt;  As a result, the city has what are termed the Montgomery Ward height restrictions on buildings and structures in Grant Park.  However, ''Crown Fountain'' and [[Jay Pritzker Pavilion]], which stands {{convert|139|ft|m}} tall, were exempt from the height restriction because they were classified as [[Work of art|works of art]] and not buildings or structures.&lt;ref&gt;Gilfoyle, p. 181&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 2006, ''Crown Fountain'' became the focus of a public controversy when the city added [[surveillance camera]]s atop each tower. Purchased through a $52&amp;nbsp;million [[Department of Homeland Security]] [[Federal grants (USA)|grant]] to the Chicago area, the cameras were part of a surveillance system augmenting eight other cameras covering all of Millennium Park.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url= http://docs.newsbank.com/openurl?ctx_ver=z39.88-2004&amp;rft_id=info:sid/iw.newsbank.com:NewsBank:CTRB&amp;rft_val_format=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:ctx&amp;rft_dat=1162481DDCDD7720&amp;svc_dat=InfoWeb:aggregated5&amp;req_dat=AA98CDC331574F0ABEAFF732B33DC0B2| title=Artworks stand alone as cameras lose perch|accessdate=April 22, 2008|date=December 20, 2006|author=Janega, James|publisher=NewsBank|work=[[Chicago Tribune]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; The city said the cameras, similar to those used throughout the city at high-crime areas and traffic intersections, were intended to remain on the towers for several months until permanent, less intrusive replacements were secured.&lt;ref name=ATWABS&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2006/12/28/us/28cameras.html|title=A Tempest When Art Became Surveillance|accessdate=April 12, 2008|date=December 28, 2006|author=Sander, Libby|publisher=The New York Times Company|work=[[The New York Times]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; City officials had consulted the architects who collaborated with Plensa on the tower designs, but Plensa himself had not been notified.&lt;ref name=Janega&gt;{{cite web|url=http://docs.newsbank.com/openurl?ctx_ver=z39.88-2004&amp;rft_id=info:sid/iw.newsbank.com:NewsBank:CTRB&amp;rft_val_format=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:ctx&amp;rft_dat=1161F38C6FC15398&amp;svc_dat=InfoWeb:aggregated5&amp;req_dat=AA98CDC331574F0ABEAFF732B33DC0B2| title=Now the Giant Faces Really are Watching|accessdate=April 22, 2008|date=December 19, 2006|author=Janega, James|publisher=NewsBank|work=[[Chicago Tribune]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Public reaction was negative, as bloggers and the artistic community decried the cameras on the towers as inappropriate and a blight.&lt;ref name=ATWABS/&gt;&lt;ref name=Janega/&gt;  The city said that the cameras were largely for security reasons, but also partly to help park officials monitor burnt-out lights.&lt;ref name=Janega/&gt; The ''[[Chicago Tribune]]'' quickly published an article concerning the cameras as well as the public reaction, and the cameras were removed the next day. Plensa supported their removal.&lt;ref name=ATWABS/&gt;

==Updating==
In 2014, the hardware and software behind the fountain's operation were replaced. At the time there were plans to replace LED lighting with [[incandescent bulb]]s on each of the non-video display surfaces and to replace the video surface LEDs. Plensa, who maintained control of the video faces for the first two years of the fountain's operation, understands that future generations may wish to update the faces used in the rotation of videos to reflect changes in humanity going forward.&lt;ref name=AitaCFrawoq&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.chicagoreader.com/chicago/crown-fountain-jaume-plensa-millennium-park-tenth-anniversary-1004-portraits/Content?oid=13887327|title=At its tenth anniversary, Crown Fountain remains a wellspring of questions|accessdate=October 8, 2015|date=June 11, 2014|work=[[Chicago Reader]]|author=Malooley, Jake}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2014, an additional 1000 faces were anticipated for 2016.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|title = Inside artist Jaume Plensa's giant Millennium Park sculptures|url = http://www.chicagotribune.com/entertainment/chi-jaume-plensa-heads-millennium-park-20140616-column.html|work=[[Chicago Tribune]]|accessdate = October 7, 2015|date=June 16, 2014|author=Borrelli, Christopher}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The fountain is featured on the cover of Philip Jodidio's 2005 book, ''Architecture: Art''.  Although Plensa is considered to be a [[conceptual artist]], according to Jodidio, Plensa created a work whose architectural aspects are paramount.  Its location juxtaposed with the Historic Michigan Boulevard District's skywall highlights these aspects.  Jodidio considers the work to be a modernization of the gargoyle theme, and feels that the scale of the enlarged faces humanize the work and challenges the architecture.  The towers are an integral part of the skyline that have achieved rare permanence for contemporary art.&lt;ref name=J162&gt;Jodidio, p. 162&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Cubist sculpture''' developed in parallel with [[Cubism|Cubist painting]], beginning in [[Paris]] around 1909 with its [[Proto-Cubism|proto-Cubist]] phase, and evolving through the early 1920s. Just as Cubist painting, Cubist sculpture is rooted in [[Paul Cézanne]]'s reduction of painted objects into component planes and geometric solids; cubes, spheres, cylinders, and cones. Presenting fragments and facets of objects that could be visually interpreted in different ways had the effect of 'revealing the structure' of the object. Cubist sculpture essentially is the dynamic rendering of three-dimensional objects in the language of [[non-Euclidean geometry]] by shifting viewpoints of volume or mass in terms of spherical, flat and hyperbolic surfaces.

==History==
[[Image:Joseph Csaky, 1911-1912, Deux Femme (Two Women), plaster lost, photo Galerie René Reichard, Frankfurt, 72dpi.jpg|thumb|210px|left|[[Joseph Csaky]], 1911-1912, ''[[Groupe de femmes|Groupe de femmes (Groupe de trois femmes, Groupe de trois personnages)]]'', plaster lost, Exhibited at the 1912 [[Salon d'Automne]] and [[Salon des Indépendants]], 1913, Paris]]
In the historical analysis of most modern movements such as Cubism there has been a tendency to suggest that sculpture trailed behind painting. Writings about individual sculptors within the Cubist movement are commonly found, while writings about Cubist sculpture are premised on painting, offering sculpture nothing more than a supporting role.&lt;ref name = "Curtis"&gt;{{cite book| author = Penelope Curtis| title = Sculpture 1900-1945: After Rodin| url = https://books.google.com/?id=JjcxddXkJXUC&amp;pg=PA118| year = 1999| publisher = Oxford University Press| isbn = 978-0-19-284228-2| page = 118 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

We are better advised, writes [[Penelope Curtis]], "to look at what is sculptural within Cubism. Cubist painting is an almost sculptural translation of the external world; its associated sculpture translates Cubist painting back into a semi-reality".&lt;ref name="Curtis" /&gt; Attempts to separate painting and sculpture, even by 1910, are very difficult. "If painters used sculpture for their own ends, so sculptors exploited the new freedom too", writes Curtis, "and we should look at what sculptors took from the discourse of painting and why. In the longer term we could read such developments as the beginning of a process in which sculpture expands, poaching painting's territory and then others, to become steadily more prominent in this century".&lt;ref name="Curtis" /&gt;

Increasingly, painters claim sculptural means of problem solving for their paintings. Braque's paper sculptures of 1911, for example, were intended to clarify and enrich his pictorial idiom. "This has meant" according to Curtis, "that we have tended to see sculpture through painting, and even to see painters as poaching sculpture. This is largely because we read Gauguin, Degas, Matisse, and Picasso as painters even when looking at their sculpture, but also because their sculptures often deserve to be spoken of as much as paintings as sculptures".&lt;ref name="Curtis" /&gt;

[[File:Pablo Picasso, 1909–10, Head of a Woman (Fernande), modeled on Fernande Olivier.jpg|thumb|[[Pablo Picasso]], 1909–10, ''Head of a Woman (Fernande)'', modeled on [[Fernande Olivier]]]]
A painting is meant both to capture the palpable three-dimensionality of the world revealed to the retina, and to draw attention to itself as a two-dimensional object, so that it is both a depiction and an object in itself.&lt;ref name="Green, MoMA"&gt;[http://www.MoMA.org/collection/details.php?theme_id=10068&amp;section_id=T020541#skipToContent Christopher Green, 2009, ''Cubism, Origins and application of the term'', MoMA, Grove Art Online, Oxford University Press]&lt;/ref&gt; Such is the case for Picasso's 1909-10 ''Head of a Woman (Head of Fernande)'', often considered the first Cubist sculpture.&lt;ref name = "Eimert, Podoksik"&gt;{{cite book| author = Guillaume Apollinaire|author2=Dorothea Eimert |author3=Anatoli Podoksik | title = Cubism| url = https://books.google.com/?id=IE16991FHJwC&amp;pg=PA130| year = 2010| publisher = Parkstone International| isbn = 978-1-84484-749-5| page = 130 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/1982/09/26/arts/art-view-picasso-revolutionized-sculpture-too.html Grace Glueck, ''Picasso Revolutionized Sculpture Too'', NY Times, exhibition review 1982] Retrieved July 20, 2010&lt;/ref&gt; Yet ''Head of a Woman'', writes Curtis, "had mainly revealed how Cubism was more interesting in Painting—where it showed in two dimensions how to represent three dimensions—than in sculpture".&lt;ref name="Curtis" /&gt; Picasso's ''Head of a Woman'' was less adventurous than his painting of 1909 and subsequent years.&lt;ref name = "Hamilton"&gt;{{cite book| author = George Heard Hamilton| title = Painting and Sculpture in Europe: 1880-1940| url = https://books.google.com/?id=iy7orpwfvFEC&amp;pg=PA269| year = 1993| publisher = YALE University Press| isbn = 978-0-300-05649-5| page = 269 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Though it is difficult to define what can properly be called a 'Cubist sculpture', Picasso's 1909-10 ''Head'' bares the hallmarks of early Cubism in that the various surfaces constituting the face and hair are broken down into irregular fragments that meet at sharp angles, rendering practically unreadable the basic volume of the head beneath. These facets are obviously a translation from two to three dimensions of the broken planes of Picasso's 1909-10 paintings.&lt;ref name ="Duchamp-Villon"&gt;{{cite book| title = Raymond Duchamp-Villon, 1876-1918| url = https://books.google.com/?id=_rZRAQAAIAAJ| year = 1967| publisher = | isbn =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the art historian Douglas Cooper, "The first true Cubist sculpture was Picasso's impressive ''Woman's Head'', modeled in 1909-10, a counterpart in three dimensions to many similar analytical and faceted heads in his paintings at the time."&lt;ref name = "Cooper"&gt;{{cite book| author = Douglas Cooper| title = The Cubist Epoch| url = https://archive.org/stream/cubistepoch00coop#page/n0/mode/2up| year = 1971| publisher = Metropolitan Museum of Art| isbn = 978-0-7148-1448-3| pages = 11–221, 231–232 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

It has been suggested that in contrast to Cubist painters, Cubist sculptors did not create a new art of 'space-time'. Unlike a flat painting, high-relief sculpture from its volumetric nature could never be limited to a single view-point. Hence, as Peter Collins highlights, it is absurd to state that Cubist sculpture, like painting, was not limited to a single point of view.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| author = Peter Collins| title = Changing Ideals in Modern Architecture, 1750-1950| url = https://books.google.com/?id=1B_sNG-umxgC&amp;pg=PA279| date = 1998-07-14| publisher = McGill-Queen's Press - MQUP| isbn = 978-0-7735-6705-4| page = 279 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The concept of Cubist sculpture may seem "paradoxical", writes George Heard Hamilton, "because the fundamental Cubist situation was the representation on a two-dimensional surface of a multi-dimensional space at least theoretically impossible to see or to represent in the three dimensions of actual space, the temptation to move from a pictorial diagram to its spatial realization proved irresistible".&lt;ref name="Hamilton" /&gt;

[[File:Albert Gleizes, 1912, Landschaft bei Paris, Paysage près de paris, Paysage de Courbevoie, oil on canvas, 72.8 x 87.1 cm, missing from Hannover since 1937.jpg|thumb|240px|[[Albert Gleizes]], 1912, ''Paysage près de paris, (Paysage de Courbevoie, Landschaft bei Paris)'', oil on canvas, 72.8 x 87.1 cm, missing from Hannover Germany since 1937]]
Now liberated from the one-to-one relationship between a fixed coordinate in space captured at a single moment in time assumed by classical vanishing-point perspective, the Cubist sculptor, just as the painter, became free to explore notions of ''simultaneity'', whereby several positions in space captured at successive time intervals could be depicted within the bounds of a single three-dimensional work of art.&lt;ref name="Antliff and Leighten"&gt;Mark Antliff, Patricia Dee Leighten, ''Cubism and Culture'', Thames &amp; Hudson, 2001&lt;/ref&gt;

Of course, 'simultaneity' and 'multiple perspective' were not the only characteristics of Cubism. In Du "Cubisme" the painters [[Albert Gleizes]] and [[Jean Metzinger]] write:

:"Some, and they are not the least intelligent, see the aim of our technique in the exclusive study of volumes. If they were to add that it suffices, surfaces being the limits of volumes and lines those of surfaces, to imitate a contour in order to represent a volume, we might agree with them; but they are thinking only of the sensation of relief, which we hold to be insufficient. We are neither geometers nor sculptors: for us lines, surfaces, and volumes are only modifications of the notion of fullness. To imitate volumes only would be to deny these modifications for the benefit of a monotonous intensity. As well renounce at once our desire for variety. Between reliefs indicated sculpturally we must contrive to hint at those lesser features which are suggested but not defined."&lt;ref&gt;Jean Metzinger and Albert Gleizes, ''Du "Cubisme"'', Edition Figuière, Paris, 1912 (First English edition: ''Cubism'', Unwin, London, 1913. In Robert L. Herbert, ''Modern Artists on Art'', Englewood Cliffs, 1964.&lt;/ref&gt;

Published in [https://archive.org/details/einblickin00wald Herwarth Walden, ''Einblick in Kunst: Expressionismus, Futurismus, Kubismus'' (1917)], [[Der Sturm]], 1912-1917]]
More astonishing still, writes John Adkins Richardson, "is the fact that the artists participating in the [Cubist] movement not only created a revolution, they surpassed it, going on to create other styles of an incredible range and dissimilarity, and even devised new forms and techniques in sculpture and ceramic arts".&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.msu.edu/course/ha/450/richardson.pdf John Adkins Richardson, ''Modern Art and Scientific Thought'', Chapter Five, ''Cubism and Logic''], University of Chicago Press, 1971, pp. 104-127&lt;/ref&gt;

"Cubists sculpture", writes Douglas Cooper, "must be discussed apart from the painting because it followed other paths, which were sometimes similar but never parallel".&lt;ref name = "Cooper" /&gt;

"But not infrequently the sculptor and the painter upset the equilibrium of the work of others by doing things which are out of key or out of proportion." (Arthur Jerome Eddy)&lt;ref name="Eddy"&gt;[https://archive.org/details/cubistsandposti00eddygoog Arthur Jerome Eddy, Cubists and Post-Impressionism, A.C. McClurg &amp; Co., Chicago, 1914, second edition 1919]&lt;/ref&gt;

The use of diverging vantage-points for representing the features of objects or subject matter became a central factor in the practice of all Cubists, leading to the assertion, as noted by the art historian Christopher Green, "that Cubist art was essentially conceptual rather than perceptual". Jean Metzinger and Albert Gleizes in their 1912 writing, along with the writings by the critic [[:fr:Maurice Raynal|Maurice Raynal]], were most responsible for the emphasis given to this claim. Raynal argued, echoing Metzinger and Gleizes, that the rejection of classical perspective in favor of multiplicity represented a break with the 'instantaneity' that characterized [[Impressionism]]. The mind now directed the optical exploration of the world. Painting and sculpture no longer merely recorded sensations generated through the eye; but resulted from the intelligence of both artist and observer. This was a mobile and dynamic investigation that explored multiple facets of the world.&lt;ref name="Green, MoMA" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Thibault"&gt;Alexandre Thibault, ''La durée picturale chez les cubistes et futuristes comme conception du monde : suggestion d'une parenté avec le problème de la temporalité en philosophie'', Faculté des Lettres Université Laval, Québec, 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

Rodin assembled three identical figures that seem to be turning around the same point.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.musee-rodin.fr/en/collections/sculptures/three-shades Rodin Museum, The Three Shades]&lt;/ref&gt;]]
The origins of Cubist sculpture are as diverse as the origins of Cubist painting, resulting from a wide range of influences, experiments and circumstances, rather than from one source. With its roots stemming as far back as ancient Egypt, Greece and Africa, the [[Proto-Cubism|proto-Cubist]] period (englobing both painting and sculpture) is characterized by the geometrization of form. It is essentially the first experimental and exploratory phase, in three-dimensional form, of an [[art movement]] known from the spring of 1911 as [[Cubism]].

The influences that characterize the transition from classical to modern sculpture range from diverse artistic movements ([[Post-Impressionism]], [[Symbolism (arts)|Symbolism]], [[Les Nabis]] and [[Neo-Impressionism]]), to the works of individual artists such as [[Auguste Rodin]], [[Aristide Maillol]], [[Antoine Bourdelle]], [[Charles Despiau]], [[Constantin Meunier]], [[Edgar Degas]], [[Paul Cézanne]], [[Georges Seurat]] and [[Paul Gauguin]] (among others), to [[African art]], [[Egyptian art]], [[Ancient Greek art]], [[Oceanic art]], [[Visual arts by indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native American art]], and [[Iberian schematic art]].

Before the advent of Cubism artists had questioned the treatment of form inherent in art since the [[Renaissance]]. [[Eugène Delacroix]] the [[Romanticism|romanticist]], [[Gustave Courbet]] the [[Realism (arts)|realist]], and virtually all the [[Impressionism|Impressionists]] had jettisoned [[Classicism]] in favor of ''immediate sensation''. The ''dynamic'' expression favored by these artists presented a challenge to the ''static'' traditional means of expression.&lt;ref name="Mittelmann"&gt;[http://cubism-coldcreation.blogspot.com/ Alex Mittelmann, ''State of the Modern Art World, The Essence of Cubism and its Evolution in Time'', 2011]&lt;/ref&gt;

In his 1914 ''Cubists and Post-Impressionism'' [[Arthur Jerome Eddy]] makes reference to [[Auguste Rodin]] and his relation to both [[Post-Impressionism]] and Cubism:

&lt;blockquote&gt;The truth is there is more of Cubism in great painting than we dream, and the extravagances of the Cubists may serve to open our eyes to beauties we have always felt without quite understanding.

Take, for instance, the strongest things by Winslow Homer; the strength lies in the big, elemental manner in which the artist rendered his impressions in lines and masses which departed widely from photographic reproductions of scenes and people.

Rodin's bronzes exhibit these same elemental qualities, qualities which are pushed to violent extremes in Cubist sculpture. But may it not be profoundly true that these very extremes, these very extravagances, by causing us to blink and rub our eyes, end in a finer understanding and appreciation of such work as Rodin's?

His Balzac is, in a profound sense, his most colossal work, and at the same time his most elemental. In its simplicity, in its use of planes and masses, it is—one might say, solely for purposes of illustration—Cubist, with none of the extravagances of Cubism. It is purely Post-Impressionistic.&lt;ref name="Eddy" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The theme of Oviri is death, savagery, wildness. Oviri stands over a dead she-wolf, while crushing the life out of her cub. As Gauguin wrote to [[Odilon Redon]], it is a matter of "life in death". From the back, Oviri looks like [[Auguste Rodin]]'s Balzac, a sort of menhir symbolizing the gush of creativity.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.musee-orsay.fr/en/collections/works-in-focus/sculpture/commentaire_id/oviri-11308.html?cHash=f88883513c Musée d'Orsay, Paul Gauguin, Oviri]&lt;/ref&gt;]]
Several factors mobilized the shift from a representational art form to one increasingly abstract; a most important factor would be found in the works of [[Paul Cézanne]], and his interpretation of nature in terms of the cylinder, the sphere, and the cone.&lt;ref name = "Erle Lora"&gt;{{cite book| author = Erle Loran| title = Cézannes̓ Composition: Analysis of His Form with Diagrams and Photographs of His Motifs| url = https://books.google.com/?id=vpbEHESVx9cC&amp;pg=PA9| year = 1963| publisher = University of California Press| isbn = 978-0-520-00768-0| page = 9 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to his tendency to simplify geometric structure, Cézanne was concerned with rendering the effect of volume and space. Cézanne's departure from classicism, however, would be best summarized in the complex treatment of surface variations (or modulations) with overlapped shifting planes, seemingly arbitrary contours, contrasts and values combined to produce a planar faceting effect. In his later works, Cézanne achieves a greater freedom, with larger, bolder, more arbitrary faceting, with dynamic and increasingly abstract results. As the colors planes acquire greater formal independence, defined objects and structures begin to lose their identity.&lt;ref name="Erle Lora" /&gt;

Avant-garde artists working in Paris had begun reevaluating their own work in relation to that of Cézanne following a retrospective of his paintings at the [[Salon d'Automne]] of 1904, and exhibitions of his work at the Salon d'Automne of 1905 and 1906, followed by two commemorative retrospectives after his death in 1907. The influence generated by the work of Cézanne, in combination with the impact of diverse cultures, suggests a means by which artists (including [[Alexander Archipenko]], [[Constantin Brâncuși]], [[Georges Braque]], [[Joseph Csaky]], [[Robert Delaunay]], [[Henri le Fauconnier]], [[Albert Gleizes]], [[Fernand Léger]], [[Jean Metzinger]], [[Amedeo Modigliani]] and [[Pablo Picasso]]) made the transition to diverse forms of [[Cubism]].&lt;ref name="Moser"&gt;Joann Moser, 1985, Jean Metzinger in Retrospect, ''Pre-Cubist Works, 1904-1909'', The University of Iowa Museum of Art, J. Paul Getty Trust, University of Washington Press, pp. 34, 35&lt;/ref&gt;

Yet the extreme to which the Cubist painters and sculptors exaggerated the distortions created by the use of multiple perspective and the depiction of forms in terms of planes is the late work of Paul Cézanne, led to a fundamental change in the formal strategy and relationship between artist and subject not anticipated by Cézanne.&lt;ref name="Green, MoMA" /&gt;

===Africa, Egyptian, Greek and Iberian art===
[[File:Fang mask Louvre MH65-104-1.jpg|thumb|120px|African [[Beti-Pahuin|Fang]] mask similar in style to those Picasso saw in Paris prior to painting ''Les Demoiselles d'Avignon'']]
Another factor in the shift towards abstraction was the increasing exposure to [[Prehistoric art]], and art produced by various cultures: [[African art]], [[Cycladic art]], [[Oceanic art]], [[Visual arts by indigenous peoples of the Americas|Art of the Americas]], the [[Art of ancient Egypt]], [[Iberian sculpture]], and [[Iberian schematic art]]. Artists such as [[Paul Gauguin]], [[Henri Matisse]], [[André Derain]], [[Henri Rousseau]] and [[Pablo Picasso]] were inspired by the stark power and stylistic simplicity of artworks produced by these cultures.&lt;ref name="Cooper" /&gt;

Around 1906, Picasso met Matisse through [[Gertrude Stein]], at a time when both artists had recently acquired an interest in [[Tribal art]], [[Iberian sculpture]] and [[African tribal masks]]. They became friendly rivals and competed with each other throughout their careers, perhaps leading to Picasso entering a new period in his work by 1907, marked by the influence of ethnographic art. Picasso's paintings of 1907 have been characterized as [[proto-Cubism]], as ''[[Les Demoiselles d'Avignon]]'', the [[Antecedent (genealogy)|antecedent]] of Cubism.&lt;ref name="Cooper" /&gt;

The African influence, which introduced anatomical simplifications, along with expressive features reminiscent of [[El Greco]], are the generally assumed starting point for the [[Proto-Cubism]] of Picasso. He began working on studies for [[Les Demoiselles d'Avignon]] after a visit to the ethnographic museum at Palais du Trocadero. But that wasn't all. Aside from further influences of the Symbolists, [[Pierre Daix]] explored Picasso’s Cubism from a formal position in relation to the ideas and works of [[Claude Lévi-Strauss]] on the subject of myth. And too, without doubt, writes Podoksik, Picasso’s proto-Cubism came not from the external appearance of events and things, but from great emotional and instinctive feelings, from the most profound layers of the psyche.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| author = Victoria Charles| title = Pablo Picasso| url = https://books.google.com/?id=W09TW-75Be0C&amp;pg=PA78| year = 2011| publisher = Parkstone International| isbn = 978-1-78042-299-2| page = 78 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| author = Anatoli Podoksik|author2=Victoria Charles| title = Pablo Picasso| url = https://books.google.com/?id=zsHayTqUCTsC&amp;pg=PA81| year = 2011| publisher = Parkstone International| isbn = 978-1-78042-285-5| page = 81 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

European artists (and art collectors) prized objects from different cultures for their stylistic traits defined as attributes of primitive expression: absence of classical perspective, simple outlines and shapes, presence of symbolic signs including the [[hieroglyph]], emotive figural distortions, and the dynamic rhythms generated by repetitive ornamental patterns.&lt;ref&gt;Solomon-Godeau, Abigail, ''Going Native: Paul Gauguin and the Invention of Primitivist Modernism'', in ''The Expanded Discourse: Feminism and Art History'', N. Broude and M. Garrard (Eds.). New York: Harper Collins, 1986, p. 314.&lt;/ref&gt;

These were the profound energizing stylistic attributes, present in the visual arts of Africa, Oceana, the Americas, that attracted not just Picasso, but many of the Parisian avant-garde that transited through a proto-Cubist phase. While some delved deeper into the problems of geometric abstraction, becoming known as Cubists, others such as Derain and Matisse chose different paths. And others still such as Brâncuși and Modigliani exhibited with the Cubists yet defied classification as Cubists.

In ''The Rise if Cubism'' [[Daniel Henry Kahnweiler]] writes of the similarities between African art with Cubist painting and sculpture:

&lt;blockquote&gt;In the years 1913 and 1914 Braque and Picasso attempted to eliminate the use of color as chiaroscuro, which had still persisted to some extent in their painting, by amalgamating painting and sculpture. Instead of having to demonstrate through shadows how one plane stands above, or in front of a second plane, they could now superimpose the planes one on the other and illustrate the relationship directly. The first attempts to do this go far back. Picasso had already begun such an enterprise in 1909, but since he did it within the limits of closed form, it was destined to fail. It resulted in a kind of colored bas-relief. Only in open planal form could this union of painting and sculpture be realized. Despite current prejudice, this endeavor to increase plastic expression through the collaboration of the two arts must be warmly approved; an enrichment of the plastic arts is certain to result from it. A number of sculptors like Lipchitz, Laurens and Archipenko have since taken up and developed this sculpto-painting.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

Nor is this form entirely new in the history of the plastic arts. The negroes of the Ivory Coast have made use of a very similar method of expression in their dance masks. These are constructed as follows: a completely flat plane forms the lower part of the face; to this is joined the high forehead, which is sometimes equally flat, sometimes bent slightly backward. While the nose is added as a simple strip of wood, two cylinders protrude about eight centimeters to form the eyes, and one slightly shorter hexahedron forms the mouth. The frontal surfaces of the cylinder and hexahedron are painted, and the hair is represented by raffia. It is true that the form is still closed here; however, it is not the "real" form, but rather a tight formal scheme of plastic primeval force. Here, too, we find a scheme of forms and "real details" (the painted eyes, mouth and hair) as stimuli. The result in the mind of the spectator, the desired effect, is a human face."&lt;ref name="Kahnweiler"&gt;[https://archive.org/details/riseofcubism00kahn Daniel-Henry Kahnweiler, ''The Rise of Cubism'', The documents of modern art; Wittenborn, Schultz, translated by Henry Aronson, notice by Robert Motherwell, New York, 1949. First published under the title ''Der Weg zum Kubismus'', in 1920]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Just as in painting, Cubist sculpture is rooted in [[Paul Cézanne]]'s reduction of painted objects into component planes and geometric solids (cubes, spheres, cylinders, and cones) along with the arts of diverse cultures. In the spring of 1908 Picasso worked on the representation of three-dimensional form and its position in space on a two-dimensional surface. "Picasso painted figures resembling Congo sculptures", wrote Kanhweiler, "and still lifes of the simplest form. His perspective in these works is similar to that of Cézanne".&lt;ref name="Kahnweiler" /&gt;

==Cubist styles==
[[File:Alexander Archipenko, 1912, Femme Marchante (Woman Walking). Reproduced in Archipenko-Album, 1921.jpg|thumb|[[Alexander Archipenko]], 1912, ''Femme Marchant (Woman Walking)'']]
The diverse styles of Cubism have been associated with the formal experiments of [[Georges Braque]] and [[Pablo Picasso]] exhibited exclusively at the Kahnweiler gallery. However, alternative contemporary views on Cubism have formed to some degree in response to the more publicized Salon Cubists ([[Jean Metzinger]], [[Albert Gleizes]], [[Robert Delaunay]], [[Henri Le Fauconnier]], [[Fernand Léger]], [[Alexander Archipenko]] and [[Joseph Csaky]]), whose methods and ideas were too distinct from those of Braque and Picasso to be considered merely secondary to them.&lt;ref name="Green, MoMA" /&gt; Cubist sculpture, just as Cubist painting, is difficult to define. Cubism in general cannot definitively be called either a style, the art of a specific group or even a specific movement. "It embraces widely disparate work, applying to artists in different milieux". (Christopher Green)&lt;ref name="Green, MoMA" /&gt;

Artist sculptors working in [[Montparnasse]] were quick to adopt the language of [[non-Euclidean geometry]], rendering three-dimensional objects by shifting viewpoints and of volume or mass in terms of successive curved or flat planes and surfaces. [[Alexander Archipenko]]'s 1912 ''Walking Woman'' is cited as the first modern sculpture with an abstracted void, i.e., a hole in the middle. [[Joseph Csaky]], following Archipenko, was the first sculptor to join the Cubists, with whom he exhibited from 1911 onward. They were joined by [[Raymond Duchamp-Villon]] (1876-1918), whose career was cut short by his death in military service, and then in 1914 by [[Jacques Lipchitz]], [[Henri Laurens]] and later [[Ossip Zadkine]].&lt;ref&gt;Robert Rosenblum, "Cubism," Readings in Art History 2 (1976), Seuphor, Sculpture of this Century&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Edith Balas, 1998"/&gt;

According to [[Herbert Read]], this has the effect of "revealing the structure" of the object, or of presenting fragments and facets of the object to be visually interpreted in different ways. Both of these effects transfer to sculpture. Although the artists themselves did not use these terms,&lt;ref name="Green, MoMA" /&gt; the distinction between "analytic cubism" and "synthetic cubism" could also be seen in sculpture, writes Read (1964): "In the analytical Cubism of Picasso and Braque, the definite purpose of the geometricization of the planes is to emphasize the formal structure of the motif represented. In the synthetic Cubism of [[Juan Gris]] the definite purpose is to create an effective formal pattern, geometricization being a means to this end."&lt;ref&gt;Herbert Read, ''A Concise History of Modern Sculpture'', Praeger, 1964&lt;/ref&gt;

===Alexander Archipenko===
[[File:Alexander Archipenko, 1913, Femme à l'Éventail (Woman with a Fan), 108 x 61.5 x 13.5 cm, Tel Aviv Museum of Art. Reproduced in Archipenko-Album, 1921.jpg|thumb|[[Alexander Archipenko]], 1913, ''Femme à l'Éventail (Woman with a Fan)'', 108 x 61.5 x 13.5 cm, [[Tel Aviv Museum of Art]]]]
[[Alexander Archipenko]] studied Egyptian and archaic Greek figures in the [[Louvre]] in 1908 when he arrived in Paris. He was "the first", according to Barr, "to work seriously and consistently at the problem of Cubist sculpture". His torso entitled "Hero" (1910) appears related stylistically to Picasso's [[Les Demoiselles d'Avignon]], "but in its energetic three-dimensional torsion it is entirely independent of Cubist painting." (Barr)&lt;ref name = "Barr"&gt;{{cite book| author = Alfred Hamilton Barr| title = Cubism and abstract art: painting, sculpture, constructions, photography, architecture, industrial art, theatre, films, posters, typography| url = https://books.google.com/?id=03_uAAAAMAAJ| year = 1936| publisher = Belknap Press of Harvard University Press| isbn = 978-0-674-17935-6 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Archipenko evolved in close contact with the Salon Cubists ([[Jean Metzinger]], [[Albert Gleizes]], [[Henri Le Fauconnier]], [[Robert Delaunay]], [[Joseph Csaky]] and others). At the same time, his affinities with [[Futurism]] were documented by the British magazine ''The Sketch'' in October 1913, where Archipenko's ''Dancers (Dance)'', reproduced on its front cover, was described as a 'Futurist sculpture'.&lt;ref name="Keiser"&gt;[http://www.henry-moore.org/docs/alexandra_keiser_0.pdf Alexandra Keiser (Archipenko Foundation/Courtauld Institute of Art), ''Photographic reproductions of Sculpture: Archipenko and Cultural Exchange'', Henry Moore Institute, 12 November 2010]&lt;/ref&gt; "In this work", writes Alexandra Keiser, "two abstracted figures are engaged in a dynamic dance movement." Moreover, the chiaroscuro observed in the photographic reproduction "accentuated the artist's multi-faceted use of positive and negative space as a compositional element to create dynamic movement, in both the fragmentation of the dancers' bodies as well as in the void created between their bodies". In the photographic reproduction of ''Dancers'', writes Keiser, "the sculpture is set off at an angle reinforcing the idea of dynamism and creating the illusion that the sculpture is propelled through space. The sculpture ''Dance'' itself as well as the style of its reproduction played strongly to the generalized notions of Futurism and to the idea that sculpture could be conceived as a specifically modern medium".&lt;ref name="Keiser" /&gt;

[[Herwarth Walden]] of [[Der Sturm]] in Berlin described Archipenko as 'the most important sculptor of our time'.&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.org/details/einblickin00wald Herwarth Walden, ''Einblick in Kunst: Expressionismus, Futurismus, Kubismus'']. Berlin: Der Sturm, 1917&lt;/ref&gt; Walden also promoted Archipenko as the foremost [[Expressionism|Expressionist]] sculptor. (Before [[World War I]] ''Expressionism'' encompassed several definitions and artistic concepts. Walden used the term to describe modern art movements including Futurism and Cubism).&lt;ref name="Keiser" /&gt;

Archipenko's ''Woman with a Fan'' (1914) combines high-relief sculpture with painted colors (polychrome) to create striking illusions of volumetric space. Experimenting with the dynamic interplay of convex and concave surfaces, Archipenko created works such as ''Woman Combing her Hair'' (1915). Depending on the movement around the sculpture and effects of lighting, concave and convex surfaces appear alternately to protrude or recede. His use of sculptural voids was inspired by the philosopher [[Henri Bergson]]'s ''Creative Evolution'' (1907) on the distortions of our understanding of reality, and how our intellect tends to define unanticipated circumstances positively or negatively. 'If the present reality is not one we are seeking, we speak of an absence of this sought reality wherever we find the presence of another'. "Archipenko's sculptural voids", write Antliff and Leighten, "allows us to fill this illusory gap with our own durational consciousness".&lt;ref name="Antliff and Leighten" /&gt;

In 1914, [[Arthur Jerome Eddy]] examined what made Archipenko's sculpture, ''Family Life'', exhibited at the [[Armory Show]] unique, powerful, modern and Cubist:
&lt;blockquote&gt; In his "Family Life," the group of man, woman, child, Archipenko deliberately subordinated all thought of beauty of form to an attempt to realize in stone the relation in life that is at the very basis of human and social existence.

Spiritual, emotional, and mathematical intellectuality, too, is behind the family group of Archipenko. This group, in plaster, might have been made of dough. It represents a featureless, large, strong male—one gets the impression of strength from humps and lumps—an impression of a female, less vivid, and the vague knowledge that a child is mixed up in the general embrace. The faces are rather blocky, the whole group with arms intertwined—arms that end suddenly, no hands, might be the sketch of a sculpture to be. But when one gets an insight it is intensely more interesting. It is, eventually, clear that in portraying his idea of family love the sculptor has built his figures with pyramidal strength; they are grafted together with love and geometric design, their limbs are bracings, ties of strength, they represent, not individuals, but the structure itself of family life. Not family life as one sees it, but the unseen, the deep emotional unseen, and in making his group when the sculptor found himself verging upon the seen—that is, when he no longer felt the unseen—he stopped. Therefore the hands were not essential. And this expression is made in the simplest way. Some will hoot at it, but others will feel the respect that is due one who simplifies and expresses the deep things of life. You may say that such is literature in marble—well, it is the most modern sculpture.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

The group is so angular, so ''Cubist'', so ugly according to accepted notions, that few look long enough to see what the sculptor means; yet strange as the group was it undeniably gave a powerful impression of the binding, the ''blending'' character of the family tie, a much more powerful impression than groups in conventional academic pose could give.&lt;ref name="Eddy" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Joseph Csaky===
[[File:Joseph Csaky, Head (Portrait d'homme), 1913, Plaster lost or destroyed, Published in Montjolie, March 1914.jpg|thumb|[[Joseph Csaky]], ''Head (self-portrait)'', 1913, Plaster lost. Photo published in Montjoie, 1914]]
[[Joseph Csaky]] arrived in Paris from his native Hungary during the summer of 1908. By autumn of 1908 Csaky shared a studio space at Cité Falguière with [[Joseph Brummer]], a Hungarian friend who had opened the Brummer Gallery with his brothers. Within three weeks, Brummer showed Csaky a sculpture he was working on: an exact copy of an [[African art|African sculpture]] from the Congo. Brummer told Csaky that another artist in Paris, a Spaniard by the name of [[Pablo Picasso]], was painting in the spirit of 'Negro' sculptures.&lt;ref name = "Edith Balas, 1998"&gt;{{cite book| author = Edith Balas| title = Joseph Csáky: A Pioneer of Modern Sculpture| url = https://archive.org/details/bub_gb_0T8LAAAAIAAJ| year = 1998| publisher = American Philosophical Society| isbn = 978-0-87169-230-6 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Living and working at [[La Ruche]] in [[Montparnasse]], Csaky exhibited his highly stylized 1909 sculpture ''Tête de femme (Portrait de Jeanne)'' at the 1910 [[Société Nationale des Beaux-Arts|Salon de la Société Nationale des Beaux-Arts]], now significantly beyond the influence of [[Auguste Rodin]]. The following year he exhibited a proto-Cubist work entitled ''Mademoiselle Douell'' (1910).&lt;ref&gt;Félix Marcilhac, ''Joseph Csaky, Une Vie - Une Oeuvre'', 23 Nov. - 21 Dec. 2007, exhibit catalogue, Galerie Félix Marcilhac&lt;/ref&gt;

Csaky's proto-Cubist works include ''Femme et enfant'' (1909), collection Zborovsky, ''Tête de femme de profil'' (1909), exhibited Société National des Beaux-Arts, 1910, ''Tête de femme de face'' (1909). By 1910-11 Csaky's Cubist works included ''Tête d'homme, Autoportrait, Tête Cubiste'' (1911), exhibited at the Salon d'Automne of 1911.&lt;ref name="Marcilhac"&gt;Marcilhac, Félix, 2007, ''Joseph Csaky, Du cubisme historique à la figuration réaliste, catalogue raisonné des sculptures'', Les Editions de l'Amateur, Paris&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1911, Csaky exhibited his Cubist sculptures, including ''Mademoiselle Douell'' (no. 1831) at the ''[[Société des Artistes Indépendants|Salon des Indépendants]]'' (21 April - 13 June) with Archipenko, [[Marcel Duchamp|Duchamp]], [[Albert Gleizes|Gleizes]], [[Marie Laurencin|Laurencin]], [[Roger de La Fresnaye|La Fresnaye]], [[Fernand Léger|Léger]], [[Francis Picabia|Picabia]] and [[Jean Metzinger|Metzinger]]. This exhibition provoked a scandal out of which Cubism was revealed to the general public for the first time. From that exhibition it emerged and spread throughout Paris and beyond.

Four months later Csaky exhibited at the ''[[Salon d'Automne]]'' (1 October - 8 November) in room XI together with the same artists, in addition to [[Amedeo Modigliani|Modigliani]] and [[František Kupka]], his ''[[Groupe de femmes]]'' (1911–1912), a massive, highly stylized block-like sculpture representing three women. At the same Salon Csaky exhibited ''Portrait de M.S.H.'', no. 91, his deeply faceted ''[[Danseuse (Csaky)|Danseuse (Femme à l'éventail, Femme à la cruche)]]'', no. 405, and ''Tête d'homme (''Tête d'adolescent)'' no. 328, the first in a series of self-portraits that would become increasingly abstract in accord with his Cubist sensibility.&lt;ref name="Marcilhac" /&gt;

The following spring, Csaky showed at the [[Salon des Indépendants]] (1913) with the same group, including [[André Lhote|Lhote]], [[Raymond Duchamp-Villon|Duchamp-Villon]] and [[Jacques Villon|Villon]].

[[File:Salon d'Automne 1912, Paris, works exhibited by Kupka, Modigliani, Csaky, Picabia, Metzinger, Le Fauconnier.jpg|thumb|left|330px|The 1912 Salon d'Automne at the Grand Palais, reproduced in ''L'Illustration''. Csaky's ''[[Groupe de femmes]]'' (1911–1912) is exhibited towards the left. Other works are shown by [[Jean Metzinger]], [[František Kupka]], [[Francis Picabia]], [[Amedeo Modigliani]] and [[Henri Le Fauconnier]].]]

Csaky exhibited as a member of [[Section d'Or]] at the Galerie La Boétie (10–30 October 1912), with Archipenko, Duchamp-Villon, La Fresnaye, Gleizes, Gris, Laurencin, Léger, Lhote, Marcoussis, Metzinger, Picabia, Kupka, Villon and Duchamp.

At the 1913 Salon des Indépendants, held March 9 through 18 May, Csaky exhibited his 1912 ''Tête de Femme (Buste de femme)'', an exceedingly faceted sculpture later purchased by [[Léonce Rosenberg]].&lt;ref name="Marcilhac" /&gt; The Cubist works were shown in room 46. Metzinger exhibited his large ''L'Oiseau bleu'' — [[Albert Gleizes]], Albert Gleizes. ''Les Joueurs de football'' (Football Players)'' 1912-13, National Gallery of Art, Washington D.C — [[Robert Delaunay]] ''The Cardiff Team (L'équipe de Cardiff )'' 1913, Van Abbemuseum, Eindhoven — [[Fernand Léger]], ''Le modèle nu dans l'atelier (Nude Model In The Studio)'' 1912-13, Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum, New York — [[Juan Gris]], ''L'Homme dans le Café (Man in Café)'' 1912, Philadelphia Museum of Art.

The inspirations that led Csaky to Cubism were diverse, as they were for artists of [[Le Bateau-Lavoir]], and other still of the [[Section d'Or]]. Certainly [[Cézanne]]'s geometric syntax was a significant influence, as well as [[Seurat]]'s scientific approach to painting. Given a growing dissatisfaction with the classical methods of representation, and the contemporary changes—the industrial revolution, exposure to art from across the world—artists began to transform their expression. Now at 9 rue Blainville in the fifth arrondissement in Paris Csaky—along with the Cubist sculptors who would follow—stimulated by the profound cultural changes and his own experiences, contributed his own personal artistic language to the movement.&lt;ref name="Edith Balas, 1998" /&gt;

Csaky wrote of the direction his art had taken during the crucial years:

&lt;blockquote&gt;"There was no question which was my way. True, I was not alone, but in the company of several artists who came from Eastern Europe. I joined the cubists in the [[Académie de La Palette|Académie La Palette]], which became the sanctuary of the new direction in art. On my part I did not want to imitate anyone or anything. This is why I joined the cubists movement." (Joseph Csaky&lt;ref name="Edith Balas, 1998" /&gt;)&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Joseph Csaky contributed substantially to the development of modern sculpture, both as an early pioneer in applying Cubist principles to sculpture, and as a leading figure in nonrepresentational art of the 1920s.&lt;ref name="Edith Balas, 1998" /&gt;

===Raymond Duchamp-Villon===
[[Image:Two views of 'The Large Horse', a bronze sculpture by Raymond Duchamp-Villon, 1914, Museum of Fine Arts, Houston.JPG|thumb|250px|[[Raymond Duchamp-Villon]], ''Two views of 'The Large Horse,'' bronze, 1914, [[Museum of Fine Arts, Houston]]]]
Although some comparison can be drawn between the mask-like totemic characteristics of various Gabon sculptures, [[Tribal art|primitive art]] was well beyond the conservative French sensibilities visible in the work of [[Raymond Duchamp-Villon]]. [[Gothic art|Gothic sculpture]], on the other hand, seems to have provided Duchamp-Villon the impetus for expressing novel possibilities of human representation, in a manner parallel to that provided by [[African art]] for Derain, Picasso, Braque and others.&lt;ref name="Duchamp-Villon" /&gt;

To his credit, Duchamp-Villon exhibited early on with the Cubists ([[Albert Gleizes]], [[Jean Metzinger]], [[Fernand Léger]], [[Henri le Fauconnier]], [[Roger de La Fresnaye]], [[Francis Picabia]], [[Joseph Csaky]]) at the 1912 [[Salon d'Automne]]; a massive public Cubist manifestation that caused yet another scandal, following from the [[Salon des Indépendants]] and [[Salon d'Automne]] of 1911. His role as architect of ''la Maison Cubiste (Cubist house)'' propelled him into the center of a politico-social scandal that accused the Cubists of ''foreign aesthetic inspiration''.&lt;ref name="Béatrice Joyeux-Prunel"&gt;[http://histoiremesure.revues.org/index2333.html Béatrice Joyeux-Prunel, ''Histoire &amp; Mesure'', no.

With the same group, including his brothers [[Jacques Villon]] and [[Marcel Duchamp]], he exhibited at the Salon de la [[Section d'Or]] in the fall of 1912.

In ''Les Peintres Cubistes'' (1913) [[Guillaume Apollinaire]] writes of Duchamp-Villon:
:"The utilitarian end aimed at by most of the contemporary architects in the cause which keeps architecture considerably behind the other arts. The architect, the engineer should build with sublime intentions: to erect the highest tower, to prepare for time and the ivy, a ruin more beautiful than any other, to throw over a harbour or a river an arch more audacious than the rainbow, to compose above all a persistent harmony the most audacious that man has ever know.

:Duchamp-Villon has this titanic conception of architecture. A sculptor and architect, light in the only thing that counts for him, and for all the other arts also, it is only light which counts, the incorruptible light."

===Jacques Lipchitz===

The early sculptures of [[Jacques Lipchitz]], 1911-1912, were conventional portraits and figure studies executed in the tradition of [[Aristide Maillol]] and [[Charles Despiau]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| author = Jacques Lipchitz|author2=Alan G.

His 1915 ''Baigneuse'' is comparable to figures from Gabun. In 1916 his figures became more abstract, though less so than those of Brâncuși's sculptures of 1912-1915.&lt;ref name="Barr" /&gt; Lipchitz' ''Baigneuse Assise'' (70.5&amp;nbsp;cm) of 1916 is clearly reminiscent of Csaky's 1913 ''Figure de Femme Debout, 1913 (Figure Habillée)'' (80&amp;nbsp;cm), exhibited in Paris at the Salon des Indépendants in the spring of 1913, with the same architectonic rendering of the shoulders, head, torso, and lower body, both with an angular pyramidal, cylidrical and spherical geometric armature. Just as some of the works of Picasso and Braque of the period are virtually indistinguishable, so too are Csaky's and Lipchitz sculptures, only Csaky's predates that of Lipchitz by three years.&lt;ref&gt;[http://s289.photobucket.com/user/DVDjHex/media/Artworks%20online/CsakyFiguredeFemmeDebout1913vsLipchitzBaigneuseAssise1916.jpg.html?&amp;_suid=136481340159408369980021379888 Joseph Csaky, 1913, ''Figure de Femme Debout (Figure Habillée)'', vs. Jacques Lipchitz, 1916, ''Baigneuse Assise'']&lt;/ref&gt;

Like Archipenko and Csaky, both Lipchitz and [[Henri Laurens]] were aware of primitive [[African art]], though hardly evident in their works. Lipchitz collected African art from 1912 on, but Laurens, in fact, appears to have been entirely unaffected by African art. Both his early reliefs and three-dimensional sculptures attach problems posed by Cubist painters first. Lipchitz and Laurens were concerned with giving tangible substance to idea first pronounced by [[Jean Metzinger]] in his 1910 ''Note sur la peinture''&lt;ref&gt;Jean Metzinger, ''Note sur la peinture (Note on painting)'', Pan, Paris, October–November 1910, 649-51&lt;/ref&gt; of simultaneous multiple views. "They were", as Goldwater notes, "undoubtedly impressed with the natural three-dimensionality of African sculpture and with its rhythmic interplay of solid and related void. But in its frontality and mass, though often composed of ''cubic'' shapes, it was anything but cubist, and was indeed, fundamentally anti-cubist in conception".&lt;ref name = "Goldwater"&gt;{{cite book| author = Robert Goldwater| title = Primitivism in Modern Art: | url = https://books.google.com/?id=l-Ldmim-CA0C&amp;pg=PA230| year = 1986| publisher = Harvard University Press| isbn = 978-0-674-70490-9| page = 230 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The African sculptor, writes Goldwater, "whether his forms were rectangular, elliptical, or round in outline, and whether he cut back little or much into the cylinder of fresh wood with which he began, was content to show one aspect of his figure at a time". Goldwater continues: :"He achieved his "instinctive" three-dimensional effect by calculated simplification and separation of parts that allowed the eye to grasp each one as a unified, coherent mass. The cubist sculptor, on the other hand, wished to "make his figure turn" by simultaneously showing or suggesting frontal and orthogonal planes, by flattening diagonals, and by swinging other hidden surfaces into view."&lt;ref name="Goldwater" /&gt;

===Henri Laurens===

Some time after Joseph Csaky's 1911-14 sculptural figures consisting of conic, cylindrical and spherical shapes, a translation of two-dimensional form into three-dimensional form had been undertaken by the French sculptor [[Henri Laurens]]. He had met Braque in 1911 and exhibited at the Salon de la [[Section d'Or]] in 1912, but his mature activity as a sculptor began in 1915 after experimenting with different materials.&lt;ref name="Hamilton" /&gt;

===Umberto Boccioni===
[[File:Umberto Boccioni, Spiral Expansion of Muscles in Action, plaster, photograph published in 1914.jpg|thumb|left|[[Umberto Boccioni]] , c.1912, ''Spiral Expansion of Muscles in Action'', plaster]]
[[Umberto Boccioni]] exhibited his [[Futurism|Futurist]] sculptures in Paris in 1913 after having studied the works of Archipenko, Brâncuși, Csaky, and Duchamp-Villon. Boccioni's background was in painting, as his Futurist colleagues, but unlike others was impelled to adapt the subjects and atmospheric faceting of Futurism to sculpture.&lt;ref name="Curtis" /&gt; For Boccioni, physical motion is relative, in opposition with absolute motion. The Futurist had no intention of abstracting reality. "We are not against nature," wrote Boccioni, "as believed by the innocent late bloomers [retardataires] of realism and naturalism, but against art, that is, against immobility."&lt;ref name="Thibault" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Umberto Boccioni, ''Dynamisme plastique : peinture et sculpture futuriste'', Lausanne, L'Age d'homme, 1975&lt;/ref&gt; While common in painting, this was rather new in sculpture. Boccioni expressed in the preface of the catalogue for the ''First Exhibition of Futurist Sculpture'' his wish to break down the stasis of sculpture by the utilization of diverse materials and coloring grey and black paint of the edges of the contour (to represent [[chiaroscuro]]). Though Boccioni had attacked [[Medardo Rosso]] for adhering closely to pictorial concepts, Lipchitz described Boccioni's 'Unique Forms' as a relief concept, just as a futurist painting translated into three-dimensions.&lt;ref name="Curtis" /&gt;

===Constantin Brâncuși===
[[File:Constantin Brancusi, 1907-08, The Kiss, Exhibited at the Armory Show and published in the Chicago Tribune, 25 March 1913..jpg|thumb|[[Constantin Brâncuși]], 1907-08, ''The Kiss'', Exhibited at the [[Armory Show]] and published in the Chicago Tribune, 25 March 1913]]
The works of [[Constantin Brâncuși]] differ considerably from others through lack of severe planar faceting often associated with those of prototypical Cubists such as Archipenko, Csaky and Duchamp-Villon (themselves already very different from one another). However, in common is the tendency toward simplification and abstract representation.

Before reviewing the works of Brâncuși, [[Arthur Jerome Eddy]] writes of [[Wilhelm Lehmbruck]]:

:"The two female figures exhibited by Lehmbruck, were simply decorative elongations of natural forms. In technic they were quite conventional. Their modeling was along purely classical lines, far more severely classical than much of the realistic work of Rodin."

The heads by Brâncuși were idealistic in the extreme; the sculptor carried his theories of mass and form so far he deliberately lost all resemblance to actuality. He uses his subjects as motives rather than models. In this respect he is not unlike—though more extreme than—the great Japanese and Chinese artists, who use life and nature arbitrarily to secure the results they desire.

I have a golden bronze head—a "Sleeping Muse," by Brâncuși—so simple, so severe in its beauty, it might have come from the Orient.

Of this head and two other pieces of sculpture exhibited by Brâncuși in July, 1913, at the Allied Artists' Exhibition in London, Roger Fry said in ''The Nation'', August 2: Constantin Brâncuși's sculptures have not, I think, been seen before in England. His three heads are the most remarkable works of sculpture at the Albert Hall. Two are in brass and one in stone. They show a technical skill which is almost disquieting, a skill which might lead him, in default of any overpowering imaginative purpose, to become a brilliant pasticheur. But it seemed to me there was evidence of passionate conviction; that the simplification of forms was no mere exercise in plastic design, but a real interpretation of the rhythm of life. These abstract vivid forms into which he compresses his heads give a vivid presentment of character; they are not empty abstractions, but filled with a content which has been clearly, and passionately apprehended.&lt;ref name="Eddy" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Eddy elaborates on Brâncuși and Archipenko:
:"It is when we come to the work of Brâncuși and Archipenko that we find the most startling examples of the reaction along purely creative lines.

Nature is purposely left far behind, as far behind as in Cubist pictures, and for very much the same reasons.

Of all the sculpture in the International Exhibition [[Armory Show]] the two pieces that excited the most ridicule were Brâncuși's egg-shaped ''Portrait of Mlle. Pogany'' and ''Family Life'' by Archipenko.

Both are creative works, products of the imagination, but in their inspiration they are fundamentally different.&lt;ref name="Eddy" /&gt;

==By World War I==
[[File:Henri Gaudier-Brzeska, 1914, Boy with a Coney (Boy with a rabbit), marble.jpg|thumb|[[Henri Gaudier-Brzeska]], 1914, ''Boy with a Coney (Boy with a rabbit)'', marble]]
In June 1915 the young modern sculptor [[Henri Gaudier-Brzeska]] lost his life in the war. Shortly before his death he wrote a letter and sent it to friends in London:

&lt;blockquote&gt;I have been fighting for two months and I can now gage the intensity of life.[...]

It would be folly to seek artistic emotions amid these little works of ours.[...]

My views on sculpture remain absolutely the same.

It is the vortex of will, of decision, that begins.

I shall derive my emotions solely from the arrangement of surfaces. I shall present my emotions by the arrangement of my surfaces, the planes and lines by which they are defined.

Just as this hill, where the Germans are solidly entrenched, gives me a nasty feeling, solely because its gentle slopes are broken up by earthworks, which throw long shadows at sunset—just so shall I get feeling, of whatsoever definition, from a statue according to its slopes, varied to infinity.

I have made an experiment. Two days ago I pinched from an enemy a mauser rifle. Its heavy, unwieldy shape swamped me with a powerful image of brutality.

I was in doubt for a long time whether it pleased or displeased me.

I found that I did not like it.

I broke the butt off and with my knife I carved in it a design, through which I tried to express a gentler order of feeling, which I preferred.

But I will emphasize that my design got its effect (just as the gun had) from a very simple composition of lines and planes. (Gaudier-Brzeska, 1915)&lt;ref name="Eddy" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Experimentation in three-dimensional art had brought sculpture into the world of painting, with unique pictorial solutions. By 1914 it was clear that sculpture had moved inexorably closer to painting, becoming a formal experiment, one inseparable from the other.&lt;ref name="Curtis" /&gt;

By the early 1920s, significant Cubist sculpture had been done in Sweden (by sculptor [[Bror Hjorth]]), in Prague (by Gutfreund and his collaborator [[Emil Filla]]), and at least two dedicated "Cubo-Futurist" sculptors were on staff at the Soviet art school [[Vkhutemas]] in Moscow ([[Boris Korolev]] and [[Vera Mukhina]]).

The movement had run its course by about 1925, but Cubist approaches to sculpture didn't end as much as they became a pervasive influence, fundamental to the related developments of [[Constructivism (art)|Constructivism]], [[Purism (arts)|Purism]], [[Futurism]], [[Die Brücke]], [[De Stijl]], [[Dada]], [[Abstract art]], [[Surrealism]] and [[Art Deco]].

[[Image:Defence Wikipedia.jpg|thumb|300px|right|deFENCE project. Click to enlarge]]

''''deFENCE'''' is an [[interactive]] [[conceptual art]] project for freedom of cohabitation, designed in such a way as to include each beholder personally. In tradition of [[Marcel Duchamp]], the ''two main roles'' of this exhibit are the work itself, and the person watching it. Only here, the subjective role of the beholder is not the only one. They are personally drawn into the exhibit, by way of a [[mirror]]. &lt;br /&gt;
The work represents a house, with its door wide open, inviting and welcoming every visitor. Except, a certain visitor is watching this house over a barbed wire fence. On the other hand, this visitor is being watched from the window of the house. The author's intention was to combine these two persons into one, so that people who had never had the chance to be on the other side of the barbed wire, can benefit in two ways: Firstly, they can see how it is to be looking over a barbed wire into a house inviting you, which you cannot reach. And secondly, they can see themselves passively looking from the house at the person outside the fence, doing nothing to remove this segregation.

The concept of this project is to bring to the attention of people living in the 'free' world that many of the boundaries that segregate others in a 'non free' world, are created by themselves. Or, at least, they do nothing to remove these boundaries.&lt;br /&gt;
The wish of the author is to help remove all boundaries that separate people and worlds.

''Note:'' 'deFENCE' project was created by Gregor Marković from [[Serbia]], in January 2006. It has been selected to take part at the International Design Biennial in St. Etienne, in 2006.

'''Emel Mathlouthi''' ({{lang-ar|آمال المثلوثي}}) (born January 11, 1982) is a Tunisian singer-songwriter best known for her [[protest song]]s "[[Ya Tounes Ya Meskina]]" ("Poor Tunisia") and "[[Kelmti Horra]]" ("My Word is Free"), which became anthems for the [[Tunisian revolution]]. Her first studio album, also titled ''Kelmti Horra'', was released worldwide by [[Harmonia Mundi]] in 2012 to critical acclaim. Her second album, "[[Ensen (album)|Ensen]]", was released by [[Partisan Records]] in 2017, also to considerable acclaim. In 2015 she performed at the Nobel Peace Prize Ceremony.&lt;ref name=press&gt;{{cite news |last=Varty |first=Alexander |title=Vancouver Folk Music Festival performers use music to make a difference |url=https://www.straight.com/article-729296/vancouver/music-makes-difference |accessdate=July 30, 2012 |newspaper=Vanvouver Free Press |date=July 12, 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120714233222/http://www.straight.com/article-729296/vancouver/music-makes-difference |archivedate=July 14, 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Curiel|first=Jonathan|title=Emel Mathlouthi: The Arab Singer Who Inspired Tunisians in Revolution|url=http://www.kqed.org/arts/music/article.jsp?essid=93432|accessdate=July 30, 2012|newspaper=KQED|date=May 9, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Minstrels of the Arab Revolution |url=http://gulfnews.com/news/minstrels-of-the-arab-revolution-1.827081 |accessdate=9 November 2012 |newspaper=[[Gulf News]] |date=25 June 2011 |author=Caroline Kulsum and Noor Al Khatib |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6C3br1WHQ?url=http://gulfnews.com/news/minstrels-of-the-arab-revolution-1.827081 |archivedate=9 November 2012 |quote=''Emel Mathlouthi, a Tunisian musician is yet another protester who asks for equality and tranquility in her native country: The morphine we've been injected with for 23 years is no longer enough to dull our pain.

==Early life and career==
Emel Mathlouthi started singing and acting since she was 8 years old in a suburb of her hometown Tunis. She wrote her first song when she was 10 years old. She discovered her strong vocal capacities when she was 15, encouraged by her entourage and inspired by great pop singers of the 90's. She found a strong refuge in heavy metal a bit later and gothic music and formed her first metal band at a university in Tunis when she was 19. A few years later deeply moved by the voice and ideas of Joan Baez after her bandmate played "The boxer" for her, she quit the band and began writing political songs,discovering her big frustration by the lack of opportunities and the apathy of her compatriots such as "Ya Tounes Ya Meskina" ("Poor Tunisia").

She opened for [[Dead Can Dance]] in the festival [[Les nuits de Fourvière]] in [[Lyon]] and performed at the [[World of Music, Arts and Dance|WOMAD Festival]] at [[Charlton Park, Wiltshire|Charlton Park]]in the UK. Israeli authorities refused to let her enter [[Ramallah]] to perform, so she sang in front of a camera in Jordan. The small show was broadcast to the Palestinian audience in a theater in Ramallah.

In 2015 she was invited to perform at both the Nobel Peace Prize Ceremony and The [[Nobel Peace Prize Concert]] along with [[A-ha]] and [[Aurora (singer)|Aurora]], where she performed two renditions of her song "Kelmti Horra," one accompanied only by a guitarist, Karim Attoumane, and the other with a full orchestra and chorus. The concert was hosted by [[Jay Leno]], who praised her in the concert press conference as being the first Arabic-language singer to catch his attention.

In 2017 she performed returned to Tunisia for her first concert there in five years, headlining the prestigious Carthage Festival. That summer she also performed at the Beitaddine Festival in Lebanon, and the SummerStage festival in Central Park, New York City.

==Debut album: ''Kelmti Horra (My Word Is Free)''==
Emel Mathlouthi released her debut, ''[[Kelmti Horra]]'', in January 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.npr.org/2013/01/05/168627909/emel-mathlouthi-voice-of-the-tunisian-revolution|title=Emel Mathlouthi: Voice Of The Tunisian Revolution|website=NPR.org|access-date=2017-08-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; The album was influenced by [[Joan Baez]], [[Massive Attack]], and [[Björk]]. As a politically aware musician, the songs in the album have made promising duty to speak out on any injustice that Emel has witnessed about her beloved Tunisia. While she sings about humanity and a better world, the success of this album has made her to reach many more people in different parts of the world. As the song, "Kelmti Horra" (My Word is Free), was considered as "the anthem of the Arab Spring," it has been Emel's most famous song so far. The outstanding success of this songs led her to perform it on December 11, 2015, during the award ceremony of the [[2015 Nobel Peace Prize]] in [[Oslo]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.festivalnuitsdafrique.com/en/artist/emel-mathlouthi|title=Emel Mathlouthi {{!}} Festival International Nuits d'Afrique de Montréal|website=www.festivalnuitsdafrique.com|language=en|access-date=2017-08-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; which was awarded to the [[Tunisian National Dialogue Quartet]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11009">A '''background actor''' or  '''extra''' is a [[performer]] in a [[film]], [[television show]], stage, musical, opera or ballet production, who appears in a nonspeaking or nonsinging (silent) capacity, usually in the background (for example, in an audience or busy street scene). [[War film]]s and [[epic film]]s often employ background actors in large numbers: some films have featured hundreds or even thousands of paid background actors as cast members (hence the term "cast of thousands"). Likewise, [[grand opera]] can involve many background actors appearing in spectacular productions.

On a film or TV set, background actors are usually referred to as "atmosphere", "background talent", "background performers", "background artists", "background cast members" or simply "background", while the term "extra" is rarely used.&lt;ref&gt;[http://tophollywoodactingcoach.com/2012/01/background_actors_extra_atmosphere/ Background Actors, Extras or Atmosphere?] ''tophollywoodactingcoach'' Published by Ross, Mae; 3-2-1 Acting. Accessed 22 May 2018&lt;/ref&gt; In a stage production, background actors are commonly referred to as "[[supernumeraries]]". In opera and ballet, they are called either "extras" or "supers".

==Casting==
Casting criteria for background actors depend on the production. It is not entirely true that background cast members require little or no [[acting]] experience, as any type of unrealistic portrayal must include some form of imagination and acting. Punctuality, reliability and the ability to take direction also figure prominently for these cast members. Background actors are often selected on short notice, after all other preparations for the shoot have been finalized.&lt;ref name="Kelly"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ftbWjFvRMZ4C&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=extra+actor&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=5Rs_Upa2IoTtigK2mYHYBQ&amp;ved=0CEYQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=extra%20actor&amp;f=false|title=The Truth About Being an Extra: How to Become a Good Background Actor|author=Jo Kelly|publisher=Google Books|accessdate=1 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Several casting agencies specialize only in background work, whilst in the UK the directory ''Contacts'' published annually by [[Spotlight (Casting Services Company)|Spotlight]] lists all accredited agencies and productions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/faqs/about/extra|title=How to be an Extra|publisher=[[BBC]]|accessdate=1 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="MMagpie" /&gt; Some agencies charge a registration fee, and some (mostly commercial background casting) will take between 10% and 15% commission from any booked work. Artists may be required to provide a basic one-page A4 sized CV/resume, that states basic personal details and dimensions, any significant skills (e.g. [[stage combat]]), and includes two 8x10 inch photographs on the rear: one head shot; one full body shot.&lt;ref name="Kelly" /&gt;&lt;ref name="MMagpie" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.dailymail.co.uk/tvshowbiz/article-10557/How-movie-extra.html|title=How to be a movie extra|publisher=[[Daily Mail]]|accessdate=1 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When hiring background actors, casting directors generally seek those with a specific "look", such as "high school students" or "affluent senior citizens", consistent with the context of the film. Casting directors may also look for background actors with a special skill for the scene, such as [[rollerblading]], or dancing. A background actor is often expected to bring his or her own wardrobe to the set, although there are also "fittings" for a specific scene or period. A casting director may favor the one who already has the required costume or prop, such as a police uniform, or a musical instrument. On other occasions, where a costume has already been prepared (for example, to fit another actor who is now unavailable), a background actor may be selected as a "costume double" simply because they are the right size to fit it. On smaller productions or student films, background actors may be hired ''en masse'' with little formality.&lt;ref name="Kelly" /&gt;

The length of a background actor's employment on a production largely depends on the needs of the director and the scenes being filmed. Some background actors are needed on the set only for a day or two, while others may remain with the film for an extended period. For instance, on [[James Cameron]]'s film ''[[Titanic (1997 film)|Titanic]]'', a group of 150 "core background actors" was hired to play the ship's passengers, and employed throughout the filming.

==Salary and working conditions==
{{Globalize|section|date=August 2010}}

===United Kingdom===
In the [[United Kingdom]], the distinction between an actor and an extra is defined by agreements between the actors [[trade union]]s [[Broadcasting, Entertainment, Cinematograph and Theatre Union|Broadcasting Entertainment Cinematograph and Theatre Union (BECTU)]] and [[Equity (trade union)|Equity]], and the various commercial trade and production bodies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bectu.org.uk/get-involved/background-artistes |title=Background Artistes |publisher=BECTU |date=2011-07-01 |accessdate=2013-03-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; These state that once a performer says 13 or more words in any scene, they must become a contracted actor in that production.&lt;ref name="EquityRA" /&gt; Minimum pay rates are defined by UK Government minimum wage regulations, and both BECTU and Equity have agreed rates with each body. However, even on non-union productions an extra's pay is an agreed day-rate for ten hours of production time.&lt;ref name=MMagpie&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.moneymagpie.com/article/make-money-being-a-film-or-tv-extra|title=Make money being a film or TV extra|publisher=Money Magpie|accessdate=1 July 2014|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140730221918/http://www.moneymagpie.com/article/make-money-being-a-film-or-tv-extra|archivedate=30 July 2014|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; All performers under agreement with BECTU/Equity are paid on-going royalties. Hence on many advertisements, which are often shown multiple times and distributed internationally, whilst the extra is paid a contracted day-rate, the largest payment is nominally due from ongoing royalties. Due to the resultant complex calculations from multiple international showings, performers under a union managed agreement are often bought-out of their advertisement royalties with a one-off payment.&lt;ref name="EquityRA"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.equity.org.uk/resource-centre/rates-and-agreements/|title=Rates and Agreements - Members Guide &amp; Pamphlet|publisher=[[Equity (trade union)|Equity]]|accessdate=1 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===United States===
In the United States, most major film and television productions used to fall under the jurisdiction of the [[Screen Actors Guild]] (SAG) or [[American Federation of Television and Radio Artists|AFTRA]].  The two unions have merged into [[SAG-AFTRA]].

SAG-signatory [[Alliance of Motion Picture and Television Producers|producers]] are allowed to hire non-union background actors after a certain number of SAG performers have been cast; non-union background actors are usually paid the minimum wage. On productions outside of union jurisdiction, payment for background actors is at the discretion of the producers, and ranges from [[Trade Union|union]]-scale rates to "copy and credit" (i.e., no pay). Those producers who do not pay their actors may be in violation of state and federal laws about minimum wage for a job.

Between 1946 and 1992, background actors in film and television were largely represented by the '''Screen Extras Guild.''' SEG was disbanded on 1 June 1992 and transferred its jurisdiction to SAG.&lt;ref&gt;[http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m1153/is_n8_v115/ai_12624085 Television and movie agreement - collective bargaining agreement; Screen Actors Guild, American Federation of Television and Radio Artists, Alliance of Motion Picture and Television Producers], Monthly Labor Review, August 1992&lt;/ref&gt;

==In popular culture==

The silent film ''[[The Extra Girl]]'' (1923) portrays a small-town girl who comes to [[Hollywood]] and becomes a background actor in her attempt to achieve stardom.

The British television sitcom ''[[Extras (TV series)|Extras]]'' (2005–07) follows the exploits of two professional background actors, Andy and Maggie. They spend most of their time on set looking for a speaking role and a boyfriend, respectively.

In the Hindi [[black comedy]] film ''[[Mithya]]'' (2008), the protagonist is a background actor whose facial similarity to an underworld [[Boss (crime)|crime boss]] lands him in trouble.

The Filipino [[comedy-drama]] film ''[[Ekstra]]'' (''The Bit Player'') (2013) centers around the life of a divorcee named Loida Malabanan, whose [[temporary work|odd job]] as a bit player for various acting roles enabled her to send her daughter to college.&lt;ref name=ekstravariety&gt;{{cite news|url=https://variety.com/2013/film/global/the-bit-player-review-toronto-1200607975/|title=Toronto Film Review: ‘The Bit Player’|last=Kuipers|first=Richard|publisher=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]|date=September 11, 2013|accessdate=December 3, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The movie is a [[social commentary]] on the exploitation and mistreatment of the [[marginalized]] sector in the [[television production]] industry in the Philippines.&lt;ref name="ekstra blog"&gt;{{cite blog|url=https://said-fred.blogspot.com/2013/07/ekstra-excellent-paradox.html|title=EKSTRA: An Excellent Paradox|last=Hawson|first=Fred|publisher=[[Blogger (service)|Blogger]]|date=July 29, 2013|accessdate=December 3, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=ekstraINQ&gt;{{cite news|url=https://opinion.inquirer.net/59179/ekstra-the-country-in-miniature|title='Ekstra': The country in miniature|last=Jimenez-David|first=Rina|publisher=[[Philippine Daily Inquirer]]|date=August 19, 2013|accessdate=December 3, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=ekstrarev&gt;{{cite blog|url=https://ilusyonaryo.wordpress.com/2014/12/11/a-review-paper-for-ekstra-2013-a-film-by-jeffrey-jeturian/|title=A review paper for Ekstra (2013): A film by Jeffrey Jeturian|&lt;!--author=migibytes--&gt;|website=ilusyonaryo.com|publisher=[[WordPress]]|date=December 11, 2014|accessdate=December 3, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Chinese-Hong Kong film ''[[I Am Somebody]]'' (2015) is about extras working at the [[Hengdian World Studios]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= https://variety.com/2015/film/asia/i-am-somebody-review-derek-yee-shanghai-film-festival-1201519295/|title= Film Review: 'I Am Somebody' |first=Maggie |last=Lee |date=17 June 2015 |accessdate=10 October 2015 |work=[[variety.com]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''ice nativity scene''' ([[German language|German]] ''Eiskrippe'') is an ice sculpture exhibited annually in the Landhaus courtyard in [[Graz]], [[Austria]], during [[Advent]] time. The project of a [[nativity scene]] made of [[glaze ice]] has been a highlight in the town’s Advent scene since 1996 and receives international media attention.

== History ==
[[File:Eiskrippe 2011 Graz 03.jpg|thumb|upright|Ice nativity scene 2011 (detail)]]
The first ice nativity scene was modelled in 1996 on behalf of the Graz tourist association. The renowned [[Villach]] ice artist Gert J. Hödl (1943–2017) who had already succeeded in [[Canada]], [[Russia]], [[Norway]] and [[Japan]] came on board for the artistic direction. After two years of planning Hödl alongside four employees carved an ice nativity scene out of 156 blocks with a total weight of 23 tons, a global first. The Landhaus in the city centre was chosen as exhibition site for artwork with life-sized characters. The complete installation was eight meters wide by four meters high.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Christian Weniger|title=Eine Eiskrippe aus 23 Tonnen Eis für Graz|publisher=[[Kleine Zeitung]]|language=de|date=1996-10-29|pages=24–25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The tourist association kept the project alive for the following years and was first able to provide online live pictures in 1998.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Eiskrippe auch im Internet|publisher=[[Kleine Zeitung]]|language=de|date=1998-11-29|page=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Since its first installation the nativity scene is sculpted in late November or early December and revealed in a solemn ceremony. In the evening hours the ice nativity scene and the [[Arcade (architecture)|Arcade halls]] of the Landhaus are colorfully illuminated.

To ensure increased durability, bigger blocks were first used in 2003, the year Graz was the [[European Capital of Culture]], and the ice weight rose to 45 tons. The ice also showed a greenish hue for the first time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Eiskrippe schimmert heuer grün|publisher=[[Kleine Zeitung]]|language=de|date=2003-11-23|page=31}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
As a tribute to a famous son of Graz, [[Arnold Schwarzenegger]], who had been elected [[Governor of California]] shortly before, Hödl put a bear – the Californian [[heraldic animal]] – in the background of the [[Holy family]], an action that greatly enhanced international media interest.&lt;ref name="hecke03"&gt;{{cite news|author=Bernd Hecke|title=Bei Krippe ist der Bär los|publisher=[[Kleine Zeitung]]|language=de|date=2003-11-29|page=25}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Other actions aimed at slowing down the melting process include a more "[[monument]]al construction" first implemented in 2004 which is supposed to generate an [[Ice house (building)|ice house]] effect.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Krippe mit Kühlhauseffekt|publisher=[[Kleine Zeitung]]|language=de|date=2004-12-04|page=21}}&lt;/ref&gt; Several sets of characters are stored in an ice house near Graz in case they are required as replacements.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Das Geheimnis hinter der Eiskrippe|periodical=|publisher=[[Kleine Zeitung]]|url=http://www.kleinezeitung.at/steiermark/graz/grazumgebung/4613162/GRAZER-ADVENT_Das-Geheimnis-hinter-der-Eiskrippe|deadurl=|format=|accessdate=2017-12-18|archiveurl=|archivedate=|last=Michael Saria|date=2014-12-08|year=|month=|day=|language=German|pages=|quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since 2014, [[Finland|Finnish]] ice artist Kimmo Frosti is responsible for the artistic design of the ice nativity scene. With support from a five-man team and [[liquid nitrogen]], it takes him about a week to complete the work. The components are then arranged with the help of a [[forklift]].&lt;ref name="saria16"&gt;{{cite web|title=Herr Frosti schnitzt die Grazer Eiskrippe|periodical=|publisher=[[Kleine Zeitung]]|url=http://www.kleinezeitung.at/steiermark/graz/5124800/Video_Herr-Frosti-schnitzt-die-Grazer-Eiskrippe|deadurl=|format=|accessdate=2017-12-18|archiveurl=|archivedate=|last=Michael Saria|date=2016-11-26|year=|month=|day=|language=German|pages=|quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="tt"&gt;{{cite web|title=Grazer Eiskrippe aus rund 50 Tonnen Eis aufgebaut|periodical=|publisher=[[Tiroler Tageszeitung]]|url=http://www.tt.com/panorama/gesellschaft/9322730-91/grazer-eiskrippe-aus-rund-50-tonnen-eis-aufgebaut.csp|deadurl=|format=|accessdate=2017-12-18|archiveurl=|archivedate=|last=|date=2014-11-28|year=|month=|day=|language=German|pages=|quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The ice nativity scene has generated international attention since its first installment. As of 2016, coverage was provided on more than 200 international TV channels and newspapers. [[press agency|Press agencies]] like ''[[The Huffington Post]]'' and ''[[Reuters]]'' reported on the project.&lt;ref name="saria16" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Ice Sculpture of Nativity Scene Created in Graz, Austria By Gert J.

== Controversy ==
[[File:Eiskrippe 2009 Graz 01.jpg|thumb|Collapsed artwork 2009]]
Despite its value as a tourist attraction there has been debate over the meaningfulness of the ice nativity scene. At warmer temperatures the construction does not always survive throughout the entirety of [[Advent]]. In 2002, the sculpture collapsed before being even opened to the public, and had to be saved by the artist with night work.&lt;ref name="hecke03" /&gt;
In 2006,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Eiskrippe im Landhaushof eingestürzt|periodical=|publisher=[[ORF (broadcaster)|ORF]]|url=http://stmv1.orf.at/stories/409301|deadurl=|format=|accessdate=2017-12-18|archiveurl=|archivedate=|last=|date=2009-12-12|year=|month=|day=|language=German|pages=|quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and 2009, the nativity scene did not edndure the warm weather and crumpled before [[Christmas]]. A local politician of the [[The Greens – The Green Alternative|Green Party]] cynically noted: 

&lt;blockquote&gt;"Due to global warming, Advent will become ever milder. This raises the question of whether the city of Graz should continue to invest more than 40,000 € in a pool of water."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Eine Eiskrippe mit Ablaufdatum|publisher=[[Kronen Zeitung]]|language=de|date=2006-12-23|page=27}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Suggestions to cancel the project have been turned down by the tourist association who argued that the ice nativity scene rendered the economically important Graz Advent an "unmistakable" event.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Grazer Eiskrippe „gerettet“|publisher=[[Kleine Zeitung]]|language=de|date=2005-12-02|page=27}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The ''[[Tiroler Tageszeitung]]'' made tongue-in-cheek claims about yearly bets of Graz citizens on the ice nativity scene’s endurance.&lt;ref name="tt" /&gt;
A planned wood roof to protect the artwork from rain was vetoed in 1999 through intervention of the [[Federal Monuments Office]] because it would disturb the ambience of the [[Renaissance architecture]]. In the same year there was a conflict of interest with a movie event that wished to keep equipment in place, which nearly prevented the popular artwork’s construction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Bernd Hecke|title=Der Eisschnitzer droht, Graz den Rücken zu kehren|publisher=[[Kleine Zeitung]]|language=de|date=1999-11-25|page=25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Trial by Jury''''', or '''''Laying Down the Law''''' as it is commonly known, is an oil-on-canvas painting from [[1840 in art|1840]] by the English painter [[Sir Edwin Landseer]], which satirises the legal profession. It depicts dogs in the roles of members of the court with a [[poodle|French poodle]] centre stage as the judge. The painting was inspired by a chance comment by a judge, while at dinner with Landseer, that the French poodle belonging to amateur artist and renowned socialite, the [[Alfred Guillaume Gabriel, Count D'Orsay|Count d'Orsay]], "would make a capital Lord Chancellor".

Landseer was a member of the [[Royal Academy]] and had become famous for his paintings and drawings of animals. His later works include ''[[Monarch of the Glen (painting)|The Monarch of the Glen]]'', an iconic and much-reproduced painting of a stag in the [[Scottish Highlands|Highlands]], and the sculptures of the lions at the foot of [[Nelson's Column]] in [[Trafalgar Square]], [[London]].

He completed ''Trial by Jury'' in 1840 — it was exhibited at the Royal Academy in the same year and was acquired by [[William Cavendish, 6th Duke of Devonshire]], who had Landseer add his [[spaniel|Blenheim spaniel]], Bony, into the scene behind the [[greyhound]]. Early copies of the painting can be seen with Bony absent. The original now hangs in the Sculpture Gallery at [[Chatsworth House]]. The poodle has been variously identified as representing [[Lord Brougham]], who had been [[Lord Chancellor]] from 1830 to 1834, or [[Lord Lyndhurst]], who had held the post three times (1827&amp;ndash;1830, 1834&amp;ndash;1835, and 1841&amp;ndash;1846).

[[File:Line of purples.png|thumb|right|200px|The line of purples circled on the CIE chromaticity diagram]]

In [[color theory]], the '''line of purples''' or '''purple boundary''' is the locus on the edge of the [[chromaticity|chromaticity diagram]] formed between extreme spectral [[red]] and [[violet (color)|violet]]. Except for these endpoints of the Line, colors on the Line are non-spectral, i. e., no monochromatic light source can generate them; rather, every color on the Line is a mixture in a ratio, unique to that color, of fully saturated red and fully saturated violet, these two spectral colors being the endpoints of visibility on the [[Electromagnetic spectrum|spectrum]] of pure [[hue|hues]]. Colors on the Line and [[spectral color]]s are the only ones that are fully [[Colorfulness|saturated]] in the sense that, for any point on the Line, no other possible color being a mixture of red and violet is more saturated than it.

Unlike spectral colors, which may be implemented, for example, by the nearly monochromatic [[light]] of a [[laser]], with precision much finer than [[MacAdam ellipse|human chromaticity resolution]], colors on the Line are more difficult to depict. The sensitivity of each type of human [[cone cell]] to ''both'' spectral red and spectral violet, being at the opposite endpoints of the Line and at the extremes of the visible spectrum, is very low. (See [[luminosity function]]) Therefore, common purple colors are not highly bright.

The line of purples, a theoretical boundary of chromaticity, is distinct from "[[purple]]s", a more general denomination of colors, which also refers to less than fully saturated colors (see [[shades of purple]] and [[shades of pink]] for examples) that form the interior of a [[triangle]] between [[white point|white]] and the line of purples in the [[CIE chromaticity diagram]].

== In color spaces ==
In [[three-dimensional space|3-dimensional]] [[color space]]s the Line, if present, becomes a [[surface (mathematics)|2-dimensional shape]]. For example, in the [[CIE XYZ]] it is a [[plane (geometry)|planar]] sector bounded by black–red and black–violet rays. In systems premised on pigment colors, such as the [[Munsell color system|Munsell]] and [[Pantone Matching System|Pantone]] systems, boundary purples might be absent because the maximally possible [[lightness]] of a pigment vanishes when its chromaticity approaches the Line, such that purple pigments near the Line are indistinguishable from [[black]].

The [[RGB color model]], although ''theoretically'' capable of approximating the colors of the Line because it is an [[additive color|additive]] system, usually practically fails because of the limitations of the light source used. The boundary of [[sRGB]] (pictured) runs approximately parallel to the Line, connecting the [[primary color|primaries]] [[red]] and [[blue (RGB)|(color wheel) blue]], and thus purples near the Line are absent from the [[gamut]] of sRGB. [[Magenta]] ink, which is one of [[CMYK color model|CMYK]]'s primaries, is also very distant from the Line for the reason explained above. The [[wide-gamut RGB color space]] approximates the colors on the Line better, but devices capable of displaying colors with this enhanced system are prohibitively expensive for ordinary consumers.

== Table of highly saturated purples ==

Most of the names of the purple colors in the table below do not denominate colors on the line of purples, but instead are slightly less than maximally [[colorfulness|colorful]], i. e. [[Colorfulness#Saturation|saturated]].

[[File:Artan, Louis.jpg|thumb|200px|Louis Artan (1870s)]]
'''Louis Victor Antonio Artan de Saint-Martin''' (20 April 1837, [[The Hague]] – 23 May 1890,  [[Nieuwpoort, Belgium|Nieuwpoort]])&lt;ref&gt;Profile @ the [[Rijksbureau voor Kunsthistorische Documentatie]].&lt;/ref&gt; was a Dutch-Belgian painter and etcher who specialized in [[seascape]]s.

==Biography==
He came from a noble family. His father was an army officer who served as an [[adjutant]] to [[Prince Frederick of the Netherlands|Prince Frederick]]. In 1842, his family moved to [[Ixelles]] and acquired Belgian citizenship, but his father died later that same year, so they moved to Brussels.
[[File:Louis Artan - Marine met vissersbootjes.JPG|thumb|left|250px|Seascape with Fishing Boats]]
He began training for a military career, but quit when he was twenty and spent the next six years travelling through the [[Ardennes]], making nature studies. During this time, he became friends with [[Edouard Delvaux]] and, after 1858, began visiting Paris, where he was influenced by the [[Barbizon school]] and the French marine painter, [[Eugène Boudin]]. Although he took some lessons from Delvaux, he remained largely self-taught.&lt;ref name="B"&gt;[http://balat.kikirpa.be/peintres/Detail_notice.php?id=99 Biographical notes] @ Dictionnaire des peintres belges.&lt;/ref&gt;

He returned to Belgium in 1860, married the following year, and settled in Ixelles. There, he was further influenced by the landscape painter [[Hippolyte Boulenger]], who took him on a tour of the [[Sonian Forest]] in [[Tervuren]]. In 1864, an economic depression resulted in the loss of his family fortune and he had to depend entirely upon painting for his income.

Despite this, he remained restless and spent the years 1867-1868 exploring [[Brittany]] and the shores of the [[English Channel]]. When he returned home, he became one of the sixteen co-founders the [[Société Libre des Beaux-Arts]], an association opposed to the stylistic hegemony of the academies and salons.&lt;ref name="B" /&gt; 
[[File:Louis Artan016.jpg|thumb|300px|Stranded Boats at Night]]
From 1873 to 1874, he lived in [[Antwerp]], where he joined with a group of progressive painters who were fighting the influence of the [[Royal Academy of Fine Arts (Antwerp)|Academy of Fine Arts]]. In 1875, he shared a studio with [[Félicien Rops]] in Paris, then settled briefly in [[Berck-sur-Mer]], where he created some of his best-known works. After 1880, he worked in a more [[Impressionism|impressionistic]] style. In 1881, he became a Knight in the [[Order of Leopold (Belgium)|Order of Leopold]]. Two years later, he was awarded a gold medal  at the [[International Colonial and Export Exhibition]] in Amsterdam.

He spent his last years living in [[De Panne]] and died nearby in Nieuwpoort, of [[influenza]], at the age of fifty-three. His tombstone was designed by [[Victor Horta]].

'''''Love Among the Walnuts: or How I Saved My Family from Being Poisoned'''''{{efn|Some sources list the book's title as ''Love Among the Walnuts: or How I Saved My Entire Family from Being Poisoned''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=James|first1=Helen Foster|title=Author Day Adventures: Bringing Literacy to Life with an Author Visit|date=2002|publisher=Scarecrow Press|location=Lanham, MD|isbn=0-8108-4370-6|page=98}}&lt;/ref&gt;}} is a [[farce|farcical]], [[satire|satirical]] [[Young adult fiction|young adult novel]] with [[fairy tale]] elements written by [[Jean Ferris]]. The story revolves around a young man, Sandy, whose family is poisoned by his scheming uncles in a bid to gain the family fortune. He moves them to Walnut Manor, a neighboring [[convalescent home]], where, with the help of the nurse Sunnie, he tries to save his family and benefit the manor's misunderstood residents.

''Love Among the Walnuts'' was first published on September 1, 1998, by [[Harcourt (publisher)|Harcourt]]. Reviews of the work have been mostly positive, with focus on the story's style and tone. It was listed as a [[YALSA Best Book for Young Adults]] and placed third on the ranked Teens' Top Ten Books list, both in 1999.

==Plot==
Horatio Alger Huntington-Ackerman, a successful businessperson, marries Mousey Huntington-Ackerman (née Malone), a striving actor, and has a child named Sandy. They move with their butler Bentley and his wife Flossie to a new country estate called Eclipse with no neighbors except the residents of Walnut Manor, a [[convalescent home]]. One evening when Sandy is a young adult, his uncles Bart and Bernie visit Eclipse. The uncles feed the family a poisoned birthday cake in an attempt to inherit the family fortune, sending everyone but Sandy and Bentley into a coma.

A court ruling mandates that a doctor be present to oversee care for the comatose patients ("the sleepers"). To meet this requirement, Sandy moves them next door to Walnut Manor. There, he meets Dr. Waldemar, the director of the facility, and Sunnie Stone, a nurse hired to care for the sleepers. While Bentley researches a cure of the sleepers' comas, Sandy and Sunnie acquaint themselves with the other patients of Walnut Manor and ultimately fall in love with one another.

With the help of Dr. Waldemar and the manor's residents, Sandy and Sunnie discover that Walnut Manor's patients were placed in the facility's care by their relatives, who, as Walnut Manor's board of directors, have been embezzling from the home. They expose the board of directors' misdeeds and Bentley revives the sleepers from their coma.

The novel has been characterized as a [[farce]], [[satire]], and [[fairy tale]].&lt;ref name="pwreview" /&gt;&lt;ref name="alan"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Cleary|first1=Patti|title=Love Among the Walnuts by Jean Ferris|url=http://scholar.lib.vt.edu/ejournals/ALAN/fall98/clip.html|accessdate=June 3, 2016|work=[[The ALAN Review]]|date=Fall 1998|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151024045610/http://scholar.lib.vt.edu/ejournals/ALAN/fall98/clip.html|archivedate=October 24, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Alethea K.

==Reception==
''Love Among the Walnuts'' received mostly positive reviews. Helbig and Perkins commented that "the large cast consists of individualized, complementary, and affectionately handled characters" and the novel's themes "are conveyed with skill and invention".&lt;ref name="dictionary" /&gt; ''[[Publishers Weekly]]'' praised the story for its "cast of offbeat characters and some punchy dialogue" while writing that its "plot will have more appeal for adults than children."&lt;ref name="pwreview" /&gt; In ''[[The Horn Book Magazine]]'', Anne St. John commented that Sandy's "emotional responses and internal struggles will ring true with teenagers who are coming of age in a time of turmoil".&lt;ref name="horn"&gt;{{cite news|last1=St. John|first1=Anne|title=Love Among the Walnuts|url=https://catalog.wccls.org/Mobile/BakerAndTaylor/Review?ISBN=0152015906&amp;UPC=&amp;position=1|accessdate=July 2, 2016|work=[[The Horn Book Magazine]]|date=January 1999|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160702060136/https://catalog.wccls.org/Mobile/BakerAndTaylor/Review?ISBN=0152015906&amp;UPC=&amp;position=1|archivedate=July 2, 2016|via=[[Washington County Cooperative Library Services]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Elaine McGuire of ''[[Voice of Youth Advocates]]'', ''Love Among the Walnuts'' is "dripping with charm but never cloying&amp;nbsp;... a fabulous book with lots of lessons about our sickeningly fast-paced '90s lifestyles."&lt;ref name="voya"&gt;{{cite news|last1=McGuire|first1=Elaine|title=Love Among the Walnuts|url=https://catalog.wccls.org/Mobile/BakerAndTaylor/Review?ISBN=0152015906&amp;UPC=&amp;position=1|accessdate=July 2, 2016|work=[[Voice of Youth Advocates]]|date=February 1999|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160702060136/https://catalog.wccls.org/Mobile/BakerAndTaylor/Review?ISBN=0152015906&amp;UPC=&amp;position=1|archivedate=July 2, 2016|via=[[Washington County Cooperative Library Services]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Paula Rohrlick, writing in ''Kliatt'', compared ''Love Among the Walnuts'' favorably to Ferris's later work, ''Once Upon a Marigold'', describing both stories as "madcap".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Rohrlick|first1=Paula|title=Ferris, Jean.

For certain reviewers, the tone and style reinforced the novel's quality. In ''School Library Journal'', Burns commented that ''Love Among the Walnuts'' "is intentionally melodramatic, coincidental, improbable, and hilarious. The restrained, tongue-in-cheek tone heightens the humor of this spoof."&lt;ref name="burns" /&gt; ''[[Kirkus Reviews]]'' compared the tone and plot of the story to that of a film directed by [[Preston Sturges]] or [[Frank Capra]], describing how it "has an unconventional style and offbeat sense of humor that will delight readers or exhaust them, depending on their tolerance for screwball comedies."&lt;ref name="kirkus" /&gt; Nancy Hinkel, then Associate Editor at Alfred A. Knopf and Crown Books for Young Readers, wrote that the story has "great writing, original ideas, and real style" as well as "a good dose of dry humor that slips past if you're not paying attention."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Hinkel|first1=Nancy|title=Would That It Were Mine&amp;nbsp;... |url=http://www.publishersweekly.com/pw/print/20010212/25538-would-that-it-were-mine.html|accessdate=July 2, 2016|work=[[Publishers Weekly]]|date=February 12, 2001|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160702062511/http://www.publishersweekly.com/pw/print/20010212/25538-would-that-it-were-mine.html|archivedate=July 2, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Helbig and Perkins described the novel's style as "fast moving, engaging, and witty."&lt;ref name="dictionary" /&gt;

Several reviews indicated reservations in recommending ''Love Among the Walnuts''. ''Publishers Weekly'' wrote that "Sandy's accelerated growth from a baby in the nursery to an adult smitten with Sunny (in the space of a chapter) early on in the novel leaves young readers little to identify with."&lt;ref name="pwreview" /&gt; ''Kirkus Reviews'' commented that "a financial subplot and a muddle of characters, defined by their eccentricities, clog the pacing"&lt;ref name="kirkus" /&gt; of the story while St. John in ''The Horn Book Magazine'' said that "some of the characters are two-dimensional".&lt;ref name="horn" /&gt;

''Love Among the Walnuts'' was one of 50 fiction titles selected as a 1999 [[Young Adult Library Services Association]] (YALSA) [[YALSA Best Book for Young Adults|Best Book for Young Adults]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Best Books for Young Adults|url=https://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-30515036.html|accessdate=July 2, 2016|work=Teacher Librarian|date=March 1, 1999|via=[[HighBeam Research]]|subscription=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was ranked third (after [[J.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4940">The '''Michle Madonna''' is the work of an unknown sculptor called the "Master of the Michle Madonna" who probably worked in [[Brno]] or [[Prague]] during the second third of the 14th century. The name of the sculpture, brought from Brno in 1856,&lt;ref&gt;Hrabovská, 2008, p. 44&lt;/ref&gt; relates to its non-original location in the parish church in Michle from where it was purchased by the [[National Gallery in Prague]].
[[File:Michelská madona, Národní galerie v Praze.jpg|thumb|''Michle Madonna'', [[National Gallery in Prague]]]]

== Description and context == 
The sculpture of the Michle Madonna is 120&amp;nbsp;cm tall and is carved from pear wood. It bears traces of polychromy. It is the most important example of the linear-rhythmic style of carving, dating from the second quarter of the 14th century in the Czech lands. This style is characterised by drapery that clings to a cylindrical torso in low, sagging pleats that have a decorative and finely drawn character, as does the linen cloth and locks of hair. The legs of the figure of the Madonna in [[contrapposto|contrapose]] are clearly distinguished between the standing and loose one. The child is resting on the Madonna’s jutting right side, towards which both the vertical and horizontal folds of the clothes converge, thus emphasising the bond between the mother and child. The lower position of the child enables the mother’s head to bow more, thereby making the sculptural composition more enclosed. The [[Christ Child|Infant Jesus]]’s hands have not survived but it is clear that he is making a [[blessing]], and is thus not turned towards his mother but towards the faithful.&lt;ref&gt;Hrabovská, 2008, pp. 18-19&lt;/ref&gt;
 
The Michle Madonna’s formal conception has much in common with the linear style of [[Gothic art#Sculpture|French stone sculpture]] of the first third of the 14th century (such as the sculpture of five apostles from the Church of St Jacques-aux-Pèlerins and the tomb sculptures of French kings at [[Basilica of St Denis|St Denis]])&lt;ref&gt;Homolka, 2005, pp. 297-298&lt;/ref&gt; that could have been mediated to the Czech context through the [[Rhineland]]. Sculptures of this style are typified by stylisation of shapes and a dense schematic linear pleating of the drapery in both standing and reclining figures. The objective details and wealth of decoration, precisely observed and reproduced, are striking. The group of wooden sculptures related to the Michle Madonna were also originally covered with polychromy, gilding and embossing.

The distinct abstracting style of the workshop of the "Master of the Michle Madonna" gradually absorbed the impulses of contemporary panel painting that was oriented more towards Italian models – the head of the Michle Madonna bears a striking resemblance to the "Madonna of Veveří". It was characterised by a greater emphasis on the physical volume of the figures and the realistic depiction of details. The workshop also produced other Moravian Madonnas (such as the "Madonna of Velké Meziříčí", the small "Apostle of Veverská Bitýška", the "Znojmo Madonna" and the "Prostějov Madonna"). Late works ascribed to the workshop of the "Master of the Michle Madonna" prefigured the abandoning of linear formalism that was accompanied by the effort to achieve specific form and greater naturalism.

'''''Max Schmitt in a Single Scull''''' (also known as '''''The Champion Single Sculls''''' or '''''The Champion, Single Sculls''''') is an 1871 painting by [[Thomas Eakins]], [[List of works by Thomas Eakins|Goodrich catalogue #44]]. It is in the permanent collection of the [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]]. Set on the [[Schuylkill River]] in [[Philadelphia]], [[Pennsylvania]], it celebrates the victory of Eakins's friend Max Schmitt in the October 5, 1870, [[single scull]]s competition.

==The Sculler==
[[File:Detail 3 max schmitt in a single scull thomas eakins.jpeg|thumb|left|Detail of Schmitt. Note the [[Racing shell#Riggers|riggers]].]]
Max Schmitt (1843–1900) had attended [[Central High School (Philadelphia)|Philadelphia Central High School]] with Eakins, and the two were close friends. Schmitt was a member of the [[Pennsylvania Barge Club]] &amp;ndash; as, it is presumed, was Eakins &amp;ndash; one of nine men's clubs in the [[Schuylkill Navy]], and twelve that rowed on the river. The Schuylkill Navy had been organized in 1858, with approximately 300 members, and began hosting annual regattas in 1859 (with a four-year hiatus for the [[American Civil War]]). Initially, the races were for 6-oared and 4-oared [[Cornish pilot gig|gigs]] and barges, but a new kind of lightweight craft was rapidly gaining popularity: the [[racing shell|racing scull]].

Sculls, or shells, were narrower, longer, and a lot faster. Gigs had their [[oarlock]]s mounted on the sides (like a rowboat), but sculls had them a couple feet outside the boat thanks to [[Racing shell#Riggers|riggers]], triangular braces that projected out from the sides. This increased the efficiency of every stroke, and led to much longer oars. Meanwhile, boats got longer and hulls got narrower, until they were as narrow as was possible while still retaining sufficient buoyancy and balance.

Schmitt was an early convert to sculls, and owned his own, named "Josie" after his sister. The name of the scull is visible in the painting just below Schmitt's right hand. In September 1866, the Schuylkill Navy's annual regatta first featured a single-sculls race (3 miles, 1 turn), and Schmitt won it. He won again in July 1867, but in September came in second to another Pennsylvania Barge rower in a longer (4 miles, 1 turn) race. He did not participate in 1868, when fellow Pennsylvania Barge rowers won first and second. Schmitt won the single-sculls title again in June 1869, but in September came in second to an [[Undine Barge Club]] rower.

==The Race==
[[File:Schuylkill river.jpeg|thumb|Schuylkill River Rowing Course (1872).]]
In 1870 the four top rowers in the Schuylkill Navy all belonged to the Pennsylvania Barge Club: Schmitt; Charles Brossman (who had won the title in 1868, and beaten Schmitt in the 4-mile race in September 1867); Austin Street (who had placed second in 1868); and John Lavens, Jr. They were the four competitors in the October championship race.

The course was 3 miles long: beginning near Turtle Rock ([[Turtle Rock Light]] is the lighthouse at the northwest end of [[Boathouse Row]]), proceeding upriver under the [[Girard Avenue Bridge|Girard Avenue]] and [[Pennsylvania Railroad, Connecting Railway Bridge|Pennsylvania Railroad Connecting Bridges]] to a stake near the [[Columbia Railroad Bridge]], making a 180-degree turn around the stake, and then heading downriver back to the starting line.

[[Image:Max schmitt schreiber and son.jpeg|thumb|Max Schmitt (circa 1871).]]
&lt;blockquote&gt;"Starting well together, Schmitt soon drew ahead followed by Street, Brossman and Lavens. When under the Girard Avenue Bridge, Brossman and Street fouled, the oars of one resting on the boat of the other. Schmitt was now three full lengths ahead. Street and Brossman again fouled in the attempt of the former to turn the eastern stake, thus crossing Brossman's bow. Schmitt had no trouble in maintaining the advantage he had gained, and won easily."&lt;ref&gt;Heilman, p. 134.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Schmitt not only re-established himself as the pre-eminent rower on the [[Schuylkill River]], he set a new record, completing the 3-mile, 1-turn course in 20:00 minutes.

Schmitt did not defend his title the following year, and Lavens won with a time of 19:59 minutes, shaving one second off Schmitt's record. Schmitt raced one-on-one against Lavens for the single-sculls championship in 1872, and won (but did not beat Lavens's record). Schmitt sat out 1873, and Lavens won again. The two raced one-on-one again in 1874, and Schmitt won again. Having regained the championship (but not the record) and never having been defeated by Lavens, Schmitt retired from single-sculls competition. But that same year, he and Lavens joined forces to help win the Four-Oared Shell competition for the Pennsylvania Barge Club. Another Eakins painting (unfinished) may commemorate that June 17, 1874 victory.

==The Painting==
[[File:Detail max schmitt in a single scull thomas eakins.jpeg|thumb|left|Detail: Eakins's self-portrait.]]
Eakins returned to Philadelphia in July 1870, following four years of study at the [[École des Beaux-Arts]] in [[Paris, France|Paris]]. He was a witness to Schmitt's victory in October. The painting's composition echoes the event by reproducing the weather conditions and position of the sun at the date and time of Schmitt's triumph. Rather than in the midst of the competition, Schmitt is depicted nearly at rest &amp;ndash; dragging his oars with the disappearing eddies of his course visible in the water. The location is just downstream of the Columbia Railroad Bridge, the site of the turn in the race.&lt;ref name=smarth/&gt; 

Eakins, who was also a keen oarsman, painted himself as the rower in the middle distance. He signed the painting &amp;ndash; "Eakins, 1871" &amp;ndash; on the stern of his scull.&lt;ref name=smarth&gt;{{cite web|last=Floryan|first=Meg|title=Eakins' The Champion Single Sculls (Max Schmitt In A Single Scull)|url=http://smarthistory.khanacademy.org/eakins-the-champion-single-sculls-max-schmitt-in-a-single-scull.html|work=[[Smarthistory]]|publisher=[[Khan Academy]]|accessdate=January 30, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This was the first of his almost thirty rowing works &amp;ndash; sketches, oil paintings, watercolors, perspective drawings &amp;ndash; created by the end of 1874.&lt;ref name=UVa&gt;{{cite web|title=Entry to the Real: The Rowing Pictures|url=http://xroads.virginia.edu/~hyper/incorp/eakins/rowing.html|work=Cross Roads|publisher=American Studies at the University of Virginia|accessdate=January 30, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The painting shows the influences of his tutors in France, [[Jean-Léon Gérôme]] and [[Léon Bonnat]], and of [[Diego Velázquez]], the Spanish artist.&lt;ref name=smarth/&gt;

==The Reception==
The painting was exhibited only once during Eakins's lifetime; at the [[Union League of Philadelphia]] for four days in April 1871. The reviews were mixed. From the ''[[Philadelphia Bulletin]]:''&lt;blockquote&gt;
"The latter artist [Eakins], who has lately returned from Europe and the influence of Gérôme, has also a picture entitled 'The Champion Single Sculls' (No. 137), which, though peculiar, has more than ordinary interest. The Artist, in dealing so boldly and broadly with the commonplace in nature, is working upon well-supported theories, and despite a somewhat scattered effect, gives promise of a conspicuous future."&lt;ref&gt;''Philadelphia Bulletin'', April 27, 1871, quoted in [[Gordon Hendricks]], "The Champion Single Sculls", ''Metropolitan Museum of Art Bulletin'', March 1968, pp. 306-07.[https://docs.google.com/viewer?a=v&amp;q=cache:Jp3GChTwhy0J:https://12.151.120.44/publications/bulletins/1/pdf/3258339.pdf.bannered.pdf+max+schmitt+philadelphia&amp;hl=en&amp;gl=us&amp;pid=bl&amp;srcid=ADGEESgKueqzf93ECywt7EhXj7FOmWz_6ONa7NifYXGRp59qr-jJ_8BsXtD2y3AzEmfTQqOO-kT8wvvCdD2HpeW1Qu_D7MBHBCRsyEERwgG6AsRi3dVTHXwilvLGlLaKF7pQ91KL9hsi&amp;sig=AHIEtbSvwWK-Is0ZXxDO5adLMxhIvDdwsw]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
From the ''[[Philadelphia Inquirer]]:''&lt;blockquote&gt;
"Thomas Eakins shows two, a portrait and a river scene, entitled 'The Champion Sculls.' While manifesting a marked ability, especially in the painting of the rower in the foreground, the whole effect is scarcely satisfactory. The light on the water, on the rower and on the trees lining the bank indicates that the sun is blazing fiercely, but on looking upward one perceives a curiously dull leaden sky."&lt;ref&gt;''Philadelphia Inquirer'', April 28, 1871, quoted in ''ibid.''&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
An assessment from 2007:&lt;blockquote&gt;
"This painting, the first of 24 rowing paintings that Eakins completed over the course of four years, was the first time rowing was the focus of serious art. However, the stuffy Philadelphia critics didn’t take well to Eakins’ subject matter, even though rowing was, at the time, one of the most popular sports. A critic remarked that his subject matter was 'a shock to the artistic conventionalities of the city'."&lt;ref&gt;Andréa Fernandes. "Feel Art Again: The Champion Single Sculls."  ''[[Mental floss]]'' magazine: October 18, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Provenance==
Eakins gave the painting to his friend Max Schmitt. Following Schmitt's 1900 death, his widow owned it until 1930, when she sold it [[Susan Macdowell Eakins]], the artist's widow.&lt;ref&gt;Rob Wilson, "Sculling to the Over-Soul: Louis Simpson, American Transcendentalism, and Thomas Eakins's ''Max Schmitt in a Single Scull''," ''American Quarterly'' (Fall 1987).&lt;/ref&gt; Mrs. Eakins consigned it to Babcock Galleries, New York City, where it failed to find a buyer. In 1934 it was purchased from Milch Galleries, New York City, by the Metropolitan Museum of Art.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.metmuseum.org/collection/the-collection-online/search/10819?=&amp;imgno=0&amp;tabname=object-information Object Information / Provenance], from Metropolitan Museum of Art.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Max Stern in Germany, c. 1925.jpg|thumbnail|Max Stern in Germany, c. 1925]]
'''Max Stern''' (1904-1987) was a [[Germans|German]]-[[Canadians|Canadian]] arts benefactor, art historian, and owner of [[Montreal]]'s landmark Dominion Gallery (in French, ''Galerie Dominion'').

== Life before WWII ==
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[Image:Stern Gallery.jpg|thumb|200px|right|Dr. Max Stern]] --&gt;
Max Stern was born in [[Mönchen-Gladbach]], [[Germany]], in April 1904. His father, Julius Stern, was a German-born Jew who worked in the textile industry, and later went into business as an art dealer. Before Max was born, his father was a prestigious art collector, and by [[World War I]], had become one of the most prominent gallery owners in [[Düsseldorf]].&lt;ref name=Pageot&gt;{{cite book|last=Pageot|first=Edith-Anne|title=Max Stern : Montreal Dealer and Patron|year=2004|publisher=Montreal Museum of Fine Arts|location=Montreal|page=15}}&lt;/ref&gt; For this reason, Max led a privileged childhood, immersed in Germanic culture.  He had his family's full support in pursuing his doctoral studies in art history. He studied in [[Cologne]], [[Berlin]], [[Vienna]] and [[Paris]], and earned his doctorate from the [[University of Bonn]] in 1928.&lt;ref name=Dombowsky&gt;{{cite book|last=Dombowsky|first=Philip|title=Dr. Max Stern and the Dominion Gallery a Selection from the Archives|year=2003|publisher=National Gallery of Canada|location=Ottawa|page=3}}&lt;/ref&gt; He then decided to become the Stern Gallery manager. His father died in 1934 and Max became the new gallery owner.&lt;ref name=Pageot /&gt;

==During the war==
Stern's ambitions grew once he became gallery owner. He hoped to one day operate galleries in [[Düsseldorf]], [[London]] and [[New York City]]. Eventually with the help of his sister and the Dutch art historian Cornelius van de Wetering, Stern managed to open a gallery in [[London]]. The official opening occurred in 1935.&lt;ref name="Dombowsky 5"&gt;{{cite book|last=Dombowsky|first=Philip|title=Dr. Max Stern and the Dominion Gallery a Selection from the Archives|year=2003|publisher=National Gallery of Canada|location=Ottawa|page=5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Unfortunately, Stern's future plans were disrupted with the rise of [[Nazism]] in Germany. He received notification from the Reich Chamber of Fine Arts that he had lost his [[professional accreditation]], and was given four weeks to either sell or dissolve all holdings within the Galerie Stern.&lt;ref name="MacKenzie 13"&gt;{{cite book|last=MacKenzie|first=Catherine Mary|title=Auktion 392 : Reclaiming the Galerie Stern, Dèusseldorf|year=2006|publisher=Concordia University|location=Montreal|page=13}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He [[appealed]] the [[mandate (criminal law)|mandate]], while trying to find a suitable [[Aryan]] citizen to assume ownership. While the gallery was temporarily "Aryan", Stern planned to open another outside Germany and wait out the [[Third Reich]].&lt;ref name="MacKenzie 13" /&gt; To achieve these means, he chose [[Netherlands|Dutch]] art historian Nathan Katz.

Unfortunately, the Nazi Chamber of Fine Arts decided that the gallery was too important to fall into the hands of a foreigner, and would consider no future deals. In September 1937, Stern was given 17 days to close his business.&lt;ref name="MacKenzie 13" /&gt; The reason for this forced closure was that all [[Jewish]] citizens had been forbidden from selling art. In November, Stern was forced to [[auction]] off a large segment of the Stern Gallery by order of the [[Nazi government]]. These artworks were sold in one of Germany's oldest auction houses, Kunsthaus Lempertz. They went on the block by their lot number, Auktion 392.&lt;ref name=Website&gt;{{cite web|last=Leo Baeck Institute|title="Auktion 392" – Reclaiming the Galerie Stern|url=http://www.lbi.org/2007/02/auktion-392-reclaiming-the-galerie-stern/|publisher=Federal Foreign Office|accessdate=17 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Not all pieces were sold, and Stern placed those that remained in storage with shipping agent Josef Roggendorf. Roggendorf held the artwork close to the Düsseldorf gallery until it was all confiscated by the National Socialist government.&lt;ref name=Dombowsky /&gt;

Stern then spent several years trying to track down the 28 confiscated paintings. He created an advertisement in the German art magazine ''Die Weltkunst'', offering a reward for any information pertaining to the paintings' locations.&lt;ref name=Dombowsky /&gt; Recovering the paintings proved to be extremely difficult. ''Musical Party'' by [[Dirck Hals]] and ''Landscape with Figures'' by [[Salomon van Ruysdael]] were eventually recovered with help from the [[Canadian government]] after the war had ended. ''Last Judgment'' by [[Hieronymus Bosch]] was returned in 1954. Other works were never found.&lt;ref name=Dombowsky /&gt;

==Post-war==
Stern fled Germany in December, 1937, reportedly carrying nothing but a small suitcase. He decided to join his sister at the gallery in London. Their plans to develop further were interrupted a few years later once the war began. Stern was interred as an enemy alien in a [[refugee camp]] on the [[Isle of Man]] for two years.&lt;ref name=Dombowsky /&gt; The British government then allowed him to [[immigrate]] to [[Canada]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Rossouw|first=Henk|title=In Pursuit of an Art Dealer's Dream|year=2006|publisher=The Chronicle of Higher Education}}&lt;/ref&gt; Stern sailed on the Polish liner ''Sobiski'',&lt;ref name=Pageot /&gt;  but was unable to get his money and belongings out of [[United Kingdom|Britain]]. He then spent two years in [[internment camps]] in [[New Brunswick]] and [[Quebec]].&lt;ref name=Dombowsky /&gt;  He was given [[refugee status]] upon his arrival. He took steps to be exempted from this status, and made contact with the man who ran the Canadian Refugee Organization, William Birks, who immediately vouched for Stern.

Because of Stern's academic background and art dealing experience, he was named director of the Dominion Gallery of Fine Art. In January 1947, Stern and his wife became the sole proprietors of Gallery Dominion. He met his wife at the Canadian Refugee organization. She was a Swedish woman named Iris Westerberg.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Pageot|first=Edith-Anne|title=Max Stern : Montreal Dealer and Patron|year=2004|publisher=Montreal Museum of Fine Arts|location=Montreal|page=16}}&lt;/ref&gt; Together, they made the gallery a focal point for the distribution of living art by Canadian artists. Both were known for promoting young and unknown Canadian art talents.

1944 was an especially important year for Stern's promotion of [[Canadian art]]. During this year, he held separate exhibitions featuring art by four members of the [[Group of Seven (artists)|Group of Seven]] and [[Emily Carr]].&lt;ref name="Dom 5-6"&gt;{{cite book|last=Dombowsky|first=Philip|title=Dr. Max Stern and the Dominion Gallery a Selection from the Archives|year=2003|publisher=National Gallery of Canada|location=Ottawa|pages=5–6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Stern made many important contributions towards Canadian art culture. In the 1940s he provided a means for young Canadian artists to paint on a full-time basis by establishing a contract system. In this system, monthly payments are made to the artist in exchange for an agreed number of works. This method has since been used successfully in [[France]], [[England]] and the [[United States]].&lt;ref name="Dom 5-6" /&gt;

In 1950, Stern moved the Dominion Gallery to a three-story building in a different area of Montreal. This new building allowed for 14 exhibition rooms and an apartment on the upper level where Stern and his wife would live.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Dombowsky|first=Philip|title=Dr. Max Stern and the Dominion Gallery a Selection from the Archives|year=2003|publisher=National Gallery of Canada|location=Ottawa|page=6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legacy==
[[File:'Ships in Distress on a Stormy Sea' by Jan Porcellis.jpg|thumb|''Ships in a Stormy Sea'', painting by [[Jan Porcellis]] recovered in 2016 and now in the [[Frans Hals Museum]]]]
Max Stern is remembered as an icon within the art society worldwide. Upon leaving [[Europe]], Stern raised the level of art appreciation in Canada. He began donating to Canadian institutions in the mid-1950s, and gave generously to several [[museums]] across Canada. He was especially generous to [[Montreal]] institutions, donating over 166 works.&lt;ref name="Dom 7"&gt;{{cite book|last=Dombowsky|first=Philip|title=Dr. Max Stern and the Dominion Gallery a Selection from the Archives|year=2003|publisher=National Gallery of Canada|location=Ottawa|page=7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

True to his occupation until the very end, Stern died on a business trip in [[Paris]]. For his contributions he received countless acknowledgements and awards, including an [[honorary doctorate]] from [[Concordia University]] in 1985. The gallery continued to operate for more than a decade after Stern's death, closing in December 2000.&lt;ref name="Dom 7" /&gt; 
 
The [[Max Stern Art Restitution Project]] was jointly created by the [[Hebrew University in Jerusalem]], [[McGill University]], [[Concordia University]] and the Holocaust Claims Processing Office in New York. The project's initiative has been to locate and recover works from the original Stern collection that were lost during the 1930s. The collection held an estimated 400 pieces in total.&lt;ref name="Dr. Max Stern and his Gallery and Art Collection from 1933-1945 and after World War II"&gt;{{cite web|last=Korte|first=Willi|title=Dr. Max Stern and his Gallery and Art Collection from 1933-1945 and after World War II|url=https://www.concordia.ca/arts/max-stern/context.html|publisher=Concordia University|accessdate=22 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sadly, less than twenty of these paintings have been recovered to date. A long and arduous project, efforts are still being made to recover all Stern pieces lost under the Nazi regime.

In 2017 a scheduled exhibition in Dusseldorf about Stern and the Restitution Project was abruptly cancelled due to local opposition, leading to intense controversy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/arts/art-and-architecture/dusseldorfs-cancellation-of-show-about-jewish-art-dealer-max-stern-sparksoutrage/article37080276/ |title=Restoration drama |last=Angel |first=Sara |date=24 November 2017 |website= |publisher=The Globe and Mail |access-date=13 December 2017 |quote=Dusseldorf's cancellation of show about Jewish art dealer Max Stern sparks outrage}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Music informatics''' is an emerging interdisciplinary research area dealing with the production, distribution, consumption, and analysis of music through technology (especially in digital formats).

Music Informatics research topics include music technologies such as peer-to-peer application, digital audio editors, online music search engines and [[Music information retrieval]]; cognitive, social, and economic issues in music; as well as improvisation and music performance. It studies this range of topics not only to better design music search and retrieval systems, but to develop a fundamental understanding of the nature of music and its associated behaviors as well. Because music informatics is an emerging discipline, it is a very dynamic area of research with many diverse viewpoints, whose future is yet to be determined.

==Sub-topics in Music Informatics research==
* Interdisciplinary relationships in Music Informatics
* The digital revolution in music its impact on music information services and music libraries
* Knowledge of current trends in music technologies including software and hardware
* Mental models in the [[Music psychology|cognition of music]] listening and performing
* Symbolic music modeling systems and computer-aided composition
* Social and economic realities of the consumption of music in Western societies
* [[Improvisation]] in music, especially where it is facilitated by music technology
* Music digital libraries and collections architectures
* Future of music distribution, the music industry, and music libraries
* [[Music information retrieval]]
* Music [[Recommendation system|Recommendation systems]]
* Studying and Synthesizing Music Expression
* Audio Signal-to-Score (singing, polyphonic, piano, etc.)
* [[Musical analysis]]
* Musical Accompaniment Systems
* Score Following
* [[Optical music recognition|Optical Music Recognition (OMR)]]
* Music Source Separation
* Music for Computer Games
* MIDI to Symbolic Score

==Music informatics in education==
Music informatics, as a [[Academic degree|degree]] subject, offers a similar learning experience to [[music technology]], but goes further into learning the principles behind the technology.&lt;ref name="sussex"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cogs.susx.ac.uk/courses/music-informatics/overview.php |title=Music Informatics |accessdate=2008-04-20 |publisher=University of Sussex}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Informatics students will not just use existing music hardware and software, but will learn [[computer programming|programming]] and [[artificial intelligence]].

== Accusations of plagiarism of Bill Hicks ==
Although Leary had been friends with fellow comedian [[Bill Hicks]] for many years, when Hicks heard ''No Cure For Cancer'', he felt that Leary had stolen his act. The friendship ended abruptly as a result.&lt;ref name="evolutionBook"&gt;{{cite book | title=Bill Hicks: Agent of Evolution | author=[[Kevin Booth]] and Michael Bertin | year=2005 | publisher=Harper Collins | isbn=0-00-719829-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the August 2006 ''[[Playboy]]'', an interviewer told Leary, "Much has been written about you and comedian Bill Hicks...People have accused you of appropriating his persona and material." Leary replied:

{{cquote|That's a great story that people like to latch onto...Very quickly we got New York club owners saying, 'You guys are too alike,' while I was saying, 'What are they fucking talking about?' It's the same approach to the subject maybe, but it's not the same act...But as I've said many times, a fable is sometimes better than the truth."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite interview | last=Leary | first=Denis | work=[[Playboy Magazine]] |date=August 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

According to [[Cynthia True]]'s biography ''American Scream: The Bill Hicks Story'', after listening to ''No Cure For Cancer'', Hicks was furious. "All these years, aside from the occasional jibe, he had pretty much shrugged off Leary's lifting. Comedians borrowed, stole stuff and even bought bits from one another. [[Milton Berle]] and [[Robin Williams]] were famous for it. This was different. Leary had, practically line for line, taken huge chunks of Bill's act and ''recorded'' it."&lt;ref name = "oouuos"&gt;{{cite book | title=American Scream: The Bill Hicks Story | first=Cynthia |last=True | year=2002 | publisher=Harper Paperbacks | isbn=0-380-80377-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Francesco Primaticcio 002.jpg|thumb|right|320px|''Odysseus and Penelope'' by [[Francesco Primaticcio]] (1563)]]
In [[Homer]]'s ''[[Odyssey]]'', '''Penelope''' ({{IPAc-en|p|ə|ˈ|n|ɛ|l|ə|p|iː}} {{respell|pə|NEL|ə-pee}}; {{lang-el|Πηνελόπεια}}, ''Pēnelópeia'', or {{lang-el|Πηνελόπη}}, ''Pēnelópē'') is the wife of [[Odysseus]], who is known for her fidelity to Odysseus while he was absent, despite having many [[Suitors of Penelope|suitors]]. Her name has therefore been traditionally associated with marital fidelity.

==Etymology==
The origin of her name is believed by [[Robert S. P. Beekes]] to be [[Pre-Greek]] and related to ''pēnelops'' (πηνέλοψ)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | author = [[Robert S. P. Beekes|R. S. P. Beekes]] | title = Etymological Dictionary of Greek | publisher = Brill | year = 2009 | page = 1186}}&lt;/ref&gt; or ''pēnelōps'' (πηνέλωψ), [[gloss (annotation)|glossed]] by [[Hesychius of Alexandria|Hesychius]] as "some kind of bird"&lt;ref&gt;[http://el.wikisource.org/wiki/%CE%93%CE%BB%CF%8E%CF543%83%CF%83%CE%B1%CE%B9/%CE%A0 Γλῶσσαι].&lt;/ref&gt; (today arbitrarily identified with the [[Eurasian wigeon]], to which [[Linnaeus]] gave the binomial ''Anas penelope''), where ''-elōps'' (-έλωψ) is a common Pre-Greek suffix for predatory animals;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.zeno.org/Pape-1880/A/%CF%87%CE%B7%CE%BD-%CE%B1%CE%BB%E1%BD%BD%CF%80%CE%B7%CE%BE Zeno.org lemma] relating πηνέλωψ (gen. πηνέλοπος) and [http://el.wikisource.org/wiki/%CE%93%CE%BB%CF%8E%CF%83%CF%83%CE%B1%CE%B9/%CE%A7 &lt;χην(ά)λοπες&gt;· ὄρνεα (predators) ποιά. ὅπερ ἔνιοι &lt;χηναλώπεκες&gt;].&lt;/ref&gt; however, the semantic relation between the proper name and the gloss is not clear. In [[folk etymology]], ''Pēnelopē'' (Πηνελόπη) is usually understood to combine the Greek word ''pēnē'' (πήνη), "[[weft]]", and ''ōps'' (ὤψ), "face", which is considered the most appropriate for a cunning weaver whose motivation is hard to decipher.&lt;ref&gt;For the mythology of weaving, see [[Weaving (mythology)]].&lt;/ref&gt;

==Role in the ''Odyssey''==

Penelope is the wife of the main character, the king of [[Ithaca]], [[Odysseus]] (Ulysses in Roman mythology), and daughter of [[Icarius of Sparta]] and his wife [[Periboea]]. She only has one son by Odysseus, [[Telemachus]], who was born just before Odysseus was called to fight in the [[Trojan War]]. She waits twenty years for the final return of her husband,&lt;ref&gt;Odysseus spends ten years in the Trojan War and ten years [[Nostos|travelling home]].&lt;/ref&gt; during which she devises various strategies to delay marrying one of the 108&lt;ref&gt;Homer. ''The Odyssey,'' Book XVI, in ''The Iliad &amp; The Odyssey''. Trans. Samuel Butler. p. 628. {{ISBN|978-1-4351-1043-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Suitors of Penelope|suitors]] (led by [[Antinous son of Eupeithes|Antinous]] and including [[Agelaus]], [[Amphinomus]], Ctessippus, [[Demoptolemus]], [[Elatus]], Euryades, [[Eurymachus]] and [[Peisandros]]).

On Odysseus's return, disguised as an old beggar, he finds that Penelope has remained faithful. She has devised tricks to delay her suitors, one of which is to pretend to be weaving a burial shroud for Odysseus's elderly father [[Laertes]] and claiming that she will choose a suitor when she has finished. Every night for three years, she undoes part of the shroud, until [[Melantho]], one of twelve unfaithful serving women, discovers her chicanery and reveals it to the suitors.

Because of her efforts to put off remarriage, Penelope is often seen as a symbol of connubial fidelity.&lt;ref&gt;J.W. Mackail, ''Penelope in the Odyssey'' (Cambridge University Press, 1916)&lt;/ref&gt; But because [[Athena]] wants her "to show herself to the wooers, that she might set their hearts a-flutter and win greater honor from her husband and her son than heretofore", Penelope does eventually appear before the suitors (xviii.160–162). As Irene de Jong comments:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
As so often, it is Athena who takes the initiative in giving the story a new direction ... Usually the motives of mortal and god coincide, here they do not: Athena wants Penelope to fan the Suitors’ desire for her and (thereby) make her more esteemed by her husband and son; Penelope has no real motive ... she simply feels an unprecedented impulse to meet the men she so loathes ... adding that she might take this opportunity to talk to [[Telemachus]] (which she will indeed do).&lt;ref&gt;Irene de Jong. (2001). ''A Narratological commentary on the Odyssey'', p.&amp;nbsp;445. Cambridge University Press, {{ISBN|0-521-46844-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[File:Antoine Bourdelle - Pénélope 1912 - Montauban.jpg|thumb|left|''Penelope'', bronze by [[Emile-Antoine Bourdelle]]]]
She is ambivalent, variously asking [[Artemis]] to kill her and, apparently, considering marrying one of the suitors. When the disguised Odysseus returns, she announces in her long interview with the disguised hero that whoever can string Odysseus's rigid bow and shoot an arrow through twelve axe heads may have her hand. "For the plot of the ''Odyssey'', of course, her decision is the turning point, the move that makes possible the long-predicted triumph of the returning hero".&lt;ref&gt;[[Bernard Knox]]. (1996). ''Introduction to [[Robert Fagles]]'s translation of '''The Odyssey''''' p.&amp;nbsp;55.&lt;/ref&gt;

There is debate as to whether Penelope is aware that Odysseus is behind the disguise.  Penelope and the suitors know that Odysseus (were he in fact present) would easily surpass all in any test of masculine skill, so she may have intentionally started the contest as an opportunity for him to reveal his identity.  On the other hand, because Odysseus seems to be the only person (perhaps excepting Telemachus) who can actually use the bow, she could just be further delaying her marriage to one of the suitors.{{citation needed|date=July 2018}}

When the contest of the bow begins, none of the suitors are able to string the bow, but Odysseus does, and wins the contest. Having done so, he proceeds to slaughter the suitors—beginning with Antinous whom he finds drinking from Odysseus' cup—with help from Telemachus, Athena and two servants, [[Eumaeus]] the [[swineherd]] and [[Philoetius]] the [[Pastoral farming|cowherd]]. Odysseus has now revealed himself in all his glory (with a little makeover by Athena); yet Penelope cannot believe that her husband has really returned—she fears that it is perhaps some god in disguise, as in the story of [[Alcmene]]—and tests him by ordering her servant [[Euryclea|Eurycleia]] to move the bed in their bridal-chamber. Odysseus protests that this cannot be done since he made the bed himself and knows that one of its legs is a living [[olive tree]]. Penelope finally accepts that he truly is her husband, a moment that highlights their ''homophrosýnē'' (ὁμοφροσύνη, "like-mindedness").&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Austin|first=Norman|title=Archery at the Dark of the Moon: Poetic Problems in Homer's Odyssey|date=1975|publisher=University of California Press|location=Berkeley|pages=231}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Homer implies, that from then on, Odysseus would live a long and happy life together with Penelope and Telemachus, wisely ruling his kingdom and enjoying wide respect and much success.&lt;ref&gt;Lawall, Thalman, Patterson, James, Spacks. "The Norton Anthology: Western Literature."[[The Odyssey]]". New York, London. 1984.&lt;/ref&gt;

In some early sources such as [[Pindar]], Pan's father is [[Apollo]] via Penelope.&lt;ref&gt;Pindar, Fr. 90 ([[Maurice Bowra|Bowra]])&lt;/ref&gt; [[Herodotus]] (2.145), [[Cicero]] (''[[De Natura Deorum|ND]]'' 3.22.56), [[Bibliotheca (Pseudo-Apollodorus)|Apollodorus]] (7.38) and [[Gaius Julius Hyginus|Hyginus]] (''[[Fabulae]]'' 224) all make Hermes and Penelope his parents. [[Pausanias (geographer)|Pausanias]] 8.12.5 records the story that Penelope had in fact been unfaithful to her husband, who banished her to Mantineia upon his return. 5th-century AD source ''[[Dionysiaca]]'' by [[Nonnus]] (14.92) names Penelope of [[Mantineia]] in Arcadia Pan's mother. Other sources ([[Duris of Samos]]; the Vergilian commentator [[Servius]]) report that Penelope slept with all 108 suitors in Odysseus' absence, and gave birth to Pan as a result.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=QKMNAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA305 Footnote in the ''Library'' by Apollodorus (of Athens)], edited by E. Capps Ph.D, LL.D.; T. E. Page, Litt.D.; W. H. D. Rouse, Litt.d.; Webster Collection of Social Anthropology, p. 305&lt;/ref&gt; This myth reflects the folk etymology that equates Pan's name (Πάν) with the Greek word for "all" (πᾶν).&lt;ref&gt;The [[Homeric Hymns|Homeric Hymn to Pan]] provides the earliest example of this wordplay, suggesting that Pan's name was born from the fact that he delighted "all" the gods.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Iconography==
[[File:Ring Penelope CdM Luynes 515.jpg|thumb|upright|Gold [[Intaglio (jewellery)|intaglio]] ring, Syria, last quarter of the 5th century BC ([[Louvre Museum]])]]

Penelope is recognizable in Greek and Roman works, from Attic vase-paintings—the Penelope Painter is recognized by his representations of her—to Roman sculpture copying or improvising upon classical Greek models, by her seated pose, by her reflective gesture of leaning her cheek on her hand, and by her protectively crossed knees, reflecting her long chastity in Odysseus' absence, an unusual pose in any other figure.&lt;ref&gt;But compare, for an unusual exception, the seated ''aulos'' player on the "[[Ludovisi Throne]].&lt;/ref&gt;

==Latin tradition==
Latin references to Penelope revolved around the sexual loyalty to her absent husband. It suited the marital aspect of Roman society representing the tranquility of the worthy family.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Mactoux|first=Marie-Madeleine|title=Pénélope: Légende et Mythe|date=1975|publisher=Annales Litteraires de L'Universite de Basancon|location=Paris|pages=129–30}}&lt;/ref&gt;  She is mentioned by various classical authors including [[Plautus]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Nixon|first=Paul|title=Plautus|date=1968|publisher=William Heinemann Ltd|location=London}} She is mentioned in the opening lines of the play Stychus&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Propertius]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Propertius|title=Complete Elegies of Propertius|date=2004|publisher=Princeton University Press|location=Princeton and Oxford}}see Elegies 2.6; 2.9 and 3.12. Propertius was one of the few Latin authors to mention Penelope's weaving ruse.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Horace]], [[Ovid]], [[Martial]] and [[Statius]].  The use of Penelope in Latin texts provided a basis for her ongoing use in the Middle Ages and Renaissance as a representation of the chaste wife. This was reinforced by her being named by [[Saint Jerome]] among pagan women famed for their chastity.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="16000">'''Post-postmodernism''' is a wide-ranging set of developments in [[critical theory]], [[philosophy]], [[architecture]], [[art]], [[literature]], and [[culture]] which are emerging from and reacting to [[postmodernism]]. Another similar recent term is [[metamodernism]].

==Periodization==
Most scholars would agree that [[modernism]] began around 1900 and continued on as the dominant cultural force in the intellectual circles of Western culture well into the mid-twentieth century.&lt;ref&gt;Compare, for example:&lt;br /&gt;{{cite book|last=Childs|first=Peter|title=Modernism|publisher=[[Routledge]]|location=New York|year=2008|isbn=978-0-415-41544-6|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-v8SXB4l7kcC|page=18}}: "[modernism] is [...] primarily located in the years 1890-1930 [...]"&lt;br /&gt;{{cite book|last=Armstrong|first=Tim|title=Modernism: A Cultural History|publisher=[[Polity Press]]|location=Cambridge|year=2005|isbn=978-0-7456-2983-4|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3k_C-1NZ4YYC&amp;dq=isbn=0-7456-2983-0|page=24}}: "[modernism] can be defined as a series of international artistic movements in the period 1900-40 [...]."&lt;/ref&gt; Like all eras, modernism encompasses many competing individual directions and is impossible to define as a discrete unity or totality. However, its chief general characteristics are often thought to include an emphasis on "radical aesthetics, technical experimentation, spatial or rhythmic, rather than chronological form, [and] self-conscious reflexiveness"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Childs|first=Peter|title=Modernism|publisher=[[Routledge]]|location=New York|year=2008|isbn=978-0-415-41544-6|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-v8SXB4l7kcC|page=18}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as the search for authenticity in human relations, abstraction in art, and utopian striving. These characteristics are normally lacking in postmodernism or are treated as objects of irony.
{{Postmodernism}}
[[Postmodernism]] arose after World War II as a reaction to the perceived failings of modernism, whose radical artistic projects had come to be associated with [[totalitarianism]]&lt;ref&gt;Cf. Groys, Boris: ''The Total Art of Stalinism'', Princeton: Princeton University Press, 1992.&lt;/ref&gt; or had been assimilated into mainstream culture. The basic features of what we now call postmodernism can be found as early as the 1940s, most notably in the work of [[Jorge Luis Borges]].&lt;ref&gt;See Barth, John: “[[The Literature of Exhaustion]].” ''The Atlantic Monthly'', August 1967, pp. 29-34.&lt;/ref&gt; However, most scholars today would agree that postmodernism began to compete with modernism in the late 1950s and gained ascendancy over it in the 1960s.&lt;ref&gt;Cf., for example, Huyssen, Andreas: ''After the Great Divide. Modernism, Mass Culture, Postmodernism''. Bloomington: Indiana University Press, 1986, p. 188.&lt;/ref&gt; Since then, postmodernism has been a dominant, though not undisputed, force in art, literature, film, music, drama, architecture, history, and continental philosophy. Salient features of postmodernism are normally thought to include the ironic play with styles, citations and narrative levels,&lt;ref&gt;See Hutcheon, Linda: ''A Poetics of Postmodernism. History, Theory, Fiction''. New York: Routledge, 1988, pp. 3-21; McHale, Brian: ''Postmodern Fiction'', London: Methuen, 1987.&lt;/ref&gt; a metaphysical skepticism or [[nihilism]] towards a "[[grand narrative]]" of  Western culture,&lt;ref&gt;See Lyotard, Jean-François, ''The Postmodern Condition: A Report on Knowledge'', Minneapolis: University of Minneapolis Press 1984&lt;/ref&gt; a preference for the virtual at the expense of the real (or more accurately, a fundamental questioning of what 'the real' constitutes)&lt;ref&gt;See Baudrillard, Jean: “[[Simulacra and Simulation]]s.” In: ''Jean Baudrillard. Selected Writings''. Stanford: Stanford University Press 1988, pp. 166-184.&lt;/ref&gt; and a "waning of affect"&lt;ref&gt;Jameson, Fredric: ''Postmodernism or, The Cultural Logic of Late Capitalism''. Durham: Duke University Press 1991, p. 16&lt;/ref&gt; on the part of the subject, who is caught up in the free interplay of virtual, endlessly reproducible signs inducing a state of consciousness similar to schizophrenia.&lt;ref&gt;Jameson, Fredric: ''Postmodernism or, The Cultural Logic of Late Capitalism''. Durham: Duke University Press 1991, pp. 26-27.&lt;/ref&gt;

Since the late 1990s there has been a small but growing feeling both in popular culture and in academia that postmodernism "has gone out of fashion."&lt;ref&gt;Potter, Garry and Lopez, Jose (eds.): ''After Postmodernism: An Introduction to Critical Realism''. London: The Athlone Press 2001, p. 4.&lt;/ref&gt; However, there have been few formal attempts to define and name the era succeeding postmodernism, and none of the proposed designations has yet become part of mainstream usage.

==Definitions==
Consensus on what constitutes an era can not be easily achieved while that era is still in its early stages. However, a common theme of current attempts to define post-postmodernism is emerging as one where faith, trust, dialogue, performance, and sincerity can work to transcend postmodern [[irony]]. The following definitions, which vary widely in depth, focus, and scope, are listed in the chronological order of their appearance.

===Turner's ''post-postmodernism''===
In 1995, the landscape architect and urban planner [[Tom Turner]] issued a book-length call for a post-postmodern turn in urban planning.&lt;ref&gt;''City as Landscape: A Post Post-modern View of Design and Planning'', (Taylor &amp; Francis: London 1995).&lt;/ref&gt; Turner criticizes the postmodern credo of “anything goes” and suggests that “the built environment professions are witnessing the gradual dawn of a post-Postmodernism that seeks to temper reason with faith.”&lt;ref&gt;''City as Landscape: A Post Post-modern View of Design and Planning'', (Taylor &amp; Francis: London 1995), p. 9.&lt;/ref&gt; In particular, Turner argues for the use of timeless organic and geometrical patterns in urban planning. As sources of such patterns he cites, among others, the Taoist-influenced work of the American architect [[Christopher Alexander]], [[gestalt psychology]]  and the [[Psychoanalysis|psychoanalyst]] [[Carl Jung]]’s concept of [[Jungian archetypes|archetypes]]. Regarding terminology, Turner urges us to “embrace post-Postmodernism – and pray for a better name.”&lt;ref&gt;''City as Landscape: A Post Post-modern View of Design and Planning'', (Taylor &amp; Francis: London 1995), p. 10; see also a summary of the book at [http://www.gardenvisit.com/history_theory/library_online_ebooks/architecture_city_as_landscape]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Epstein's ''trans-postmodernism''===
In his 1999 book on [[Russian postmodernism]] the Russian-American Slavist [[Mikhail Epstein]] suggested that postmodernism  “is […] part of a much larger historical formation,” which he calls “[[postmodernity]].”&lt;ref&gt;Epstein, Mikhail; Genis, Alexander; Vladiv-Glover, Slobodanka. ''Russian Postmodernism. New Perspectives on Post-Soviet Culture''. Berghahn Books: New York, 1999, p. 467.&lt;/ref&gt; Epstein believes that postmodernist aesthetics will eventually become entirely conventional and provide the foundation for a new, non-ironic kind of poetry, which he describes using the prefix "[[:wikt:trans-|trans-]]":
{{quote|In considering the names that might possibly be used to designate the new era following "postmodernism," one finds that the prefix "trans" stands out in a special way. The last third of the 20th century developed under the sign of "post," which signalled the demise of such concepts of modernity as "truth" and "objectivity," "soul" and "subjectivity," "utopia" and "ideality," "primary origin" and "originality," "sincerity" and "sentimentality." All of these concepts are now being reborn in the form of "trans-subjectivity," "trans-idealism," "trans-utopianism," "trans-originality," "trans-lyricism," "trans-sentimentality" etc.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.focusing.org/apm_papers/epstein.html | title=Epstein (specific) - the Place of Postmodernism in Postmodernity}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

As an example Epstein cites the work of the contemporary Russian poet [[Timur Kibirov]].&lt;ref&gt;Epstein, Mikhail; Genis, Alexander; Vladiv-Glover, Slobodanka. ''Russian Postmodernism. New Perspectives on Post-Soviet Culture''. Berghahn Books: New York, 1999, pp. 457-460&lt;/ref&gt;

===Gans' ''post-millennialism''===
The term ''post-millennialism'' was introduced in 2000 by the American cultural theorist [[Eric Gans]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last = Gans | first = Eric | authorlink = Eric Gans | title = The Post-Millennial Age | journal = Anthropoetics | volume = 209 | date = June 3, 2000 | url = http://www.anthropoetics.ucla.edu/views/vw209/ | accessdate = {{date|2011-06-17|mdy}}}}&lt;/ref&gt; to describe the era after postmodernism in ethical and socio-political terms. Gans associates postmodernism closely with "victimary thinking," which he defines as being based on a non-negotiable ethical opposition between perpetrators and victims arising out of the experience of [[Auschwitz]] and [[Hiroshima]]. In Gans's view, the ethics of postmodernism is derived from identifying with the peripheral victim and disdaining the utopian center occupied by the perpetrator. Postmodernism in this sense is marked by a victimary politics that is productive in its opposition to modernist utopianism and totalitarianism but unproductive in its resentment of capitalism and liberal democracy, which he sees as the long-term agents of global reconciliation. In contrast to postmodernism, post-millennialism is distinguished by the rejection of victimary thinking and a turn to "non-victimary dialogue"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last = Gans | first = Eric | authorlink = Eric Gans | title = Victimary Thinking Forever? | journal = Anthropoetics | volume = 230 | date = March 31, 2001 | url = http://www.anthropoetics.ucla.edu/views/vw230.htm | accessdate = {{date|2011-06-17|mdy}}}}&lt;/ref&gt; that will "diminish […] the amount of resentment in the world."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last = Gans | first = Eric | authorlink = Eric Gans | title = Moral Heroism | journal = Anthropoetics | volume = 237 | date = June 9, 2001 | url = http://www.anthropoetics.ucla.edu/views/vw237.htm | accessdate = {{date|2011-06-17|mdy}}}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gans has developed the notion of post-millennialism further in many of his internet ''Chronicles of Love and Resentment''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | last = Gans | first = Eric | authorlink = Eric Gans | title = Chronicles of Love and Resentment | work = Anthropoetics | publisher = [[University of California, Los Angeles]] | date =  | url = http://www.anthropoetics.ucla.edu/views/Chronicles_home.cfm | accessdate = {{date|2011-06-17|mdy}} }}{{dead link|date=March 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; and the term is allied closely with his theory of [[generative anthropology]] and his scenic concept of history.&lt;ref&gt;For more on both see Gans, Eric: ''Originary Thinking: Elements of Generative Anthropology''. Stanford, California: Stanford University Press 1993.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Kirby's ''pseudo-modernism'' or ''digimodernism''===
In his 2006 paper [[The Death of Postmodernism and Beyond]], the British scholar [[Alan Kirby (writer)|Alan Kirby]] formulated a socio-cultural assessment of post-postmodernism that he calls “pseudo-modernism.”&lt;ref name="philosophynow"&gt;{{Cite journal | last = Kirby | first = Alan | authorlink = Alan Kirby (writer)| title = The Death of Postmodernism And Beyond | journal = Philosophy Now | volume = | issue = 58 | date = November–December 2006 | language =  | url = http://www.philosophynow.org/issue58/58kirby.htm | accessdate = {{date|2011-06-17|mdy}}}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kirby associates pseudo-modernism with the triteness and shallowness resulting from the instantaneous, direct, and superficial participation in culture made possible by the internet, mobile phones, interactive television and similar means: "In pseudo-modernism one phones, clicks, presses, surfs, chooses, moves, downloads."&lt;ref name="philosophynow" /&gt;

Pseudo-modernism's "typical intellectual states" are furthermore described as being "[[ignorance]], [[fanaticism]] and [[anxiety]]" and it is said to produce a "trance-like state" in those participating in it. The net result of this media-induced shallowness and instantaneous participation in trivial events is a "silent autism" superseding "the neurosis of modernism and the narcissism of postmodernism." Kirby sees no aesthetically valuable works coming out of "pseudo-modernism." As examples of its triteness he cites reality TV, interactive news programs, "the drivel found […] on some [[wikipedia|Wikipedia pages]]", docu-soaps, and the essayistic cinema of [[Michael Moore]] or [[Morgan Spurlock]].&lt;ref name="philosophynow"/&gt; In a book published in September 2009 titled ''Digimodernism: How New Technologies Dismantle the Postmodern and Reconfigure our Culture'', Kirby developed further and nuanced his views on culture and textuality in the aftermath of [[postmodernism]].

===Vermeulen and van den Akker's ''metamodernism''===
In 2010 the cultural theorists Timotheus Vermeulen and Robin van den Akker introduced the term [[metamodernism]] &lt;ref name="journalofaestheticsandculture"&gt;Vermeulen, Timotheus and Robin van den Akker. "[http://aestheticsandculture.net/index.php/jac/article/view/5677/6304 Notes on metamodernism]", ''Journal of Aesthetics and Culture" 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; as an intervention in the post-postmodernism debate. In their article 'Notes on metamodernism' they assert that the 2000s are characterized by the emergence of a sensibility that oscillates between, and must be situated beyond, modern positions and postmodern strategies. As examples of the metamodern sensibility Vermeulen and van den Akker cite the 'informed naivety', 'pragmatic idealism' and 'moderate fanaticism' of the various cultural responses to, among others, climate change, the financial crisis, and (geo)political instability.

The prefix 'meta' here refers not to some reflective stance or repeated rumination, but to Plato's ''[[metaxy]]'', which intends a movement between opposite poles as well as beyond.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.metamodernism.com/2010/10/14/what-meta-means-and-does-not-mean/ | title=What meta means and does not mean}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Pungency''' is the condition of having a strong, sharp [[Olfaction|smell]] or [[flavor]] that is often so strong that it is unpleasant; for example, the pungent smell of a dirty animal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.collinsdictionary.com/dictionary/english/pungency#pungency_1 |title=Pungency |publisher=Collins English Dictionary |date=February 3, 2014 |accessdate=February 7, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Pungent"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/pungent |title=Merriam-Webster Dictionary: "Pungent" |publisher=Merriam-webster.com |accessdate=February 7, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Pungency'' is the technical term used by scientists to refer to the characteristic of food commonly referred to as '''spiciness''' or '''hotness''' and sometimes '''heat''',&lt;ref name=PNAS&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Tewksbury|first1=J. J.|last2=Reagan|first2=K. M.|last3=Machnicki|first3=N. J.|last4=Carlo|first4=T. A.|last5=Haak|first5=D. C.|last6=Penaloza|first6=A. L. C.|last7=Levey|first7=D.

The term '''piquancy''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|p|iː|k|ən|s|i}}) is sometimes applied to foods with a lower degree of pungency&lt;ref name="Pungent" /&gt; that are "agreeably stimulating to the palate." Examples of piquant food include [[mustard (condiment)|mustard]] and [[curry]].

The terms "pungent" ({{IPAc-en|audio=en-us-pungent.ogg|ˈ|p|ʌ|n|dʒ|ən|t}}) and "pungency" are rarely used in colloquial speech but are preferred by scientists as they eliminate the potential ambiguity arising from use of the words "hot" and "spicy", which can also refer to temperature and the presence of [[spice]]s, respectively.&lt;ref name=PNAS/&gt;&lt;ref name="Institute"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.chilepepperinstitute.org/files/tiny_mce/file_manager/educ_info/Chile%20Terminology.pdf |title=Chile Terminology |year=2006 |website= |publisher=Chile Pepper Institute, New Mexico State University |accessdate=September 14, 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121016183559/http://www.chilepepperinstitute.org/files/tiny_mce/file_manager/educ_info/Chile%20Terminology.pdf |archive-date=October 16, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |url=http://rspb.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/279/1735/2012.abstract |title=Why are not all chilies hot? A trade-off limits pungency |journal=Proceedings of the Royal Society B: Biological Sciences |volume=279 |issue=1735 |pages=2012–2017 |accessdate=September 16, 2012|doi=10.1098/rspb.2011.2091 |pmid=22189403 |pmc=3311884 |year=2011 |last1=Haak |first1=D. C. |last2=McGinnis |first2=L. A. |last3=Levey |first3=D. J. |last4=Tewksbury |first4=J. J. }}&lt;/ref&gt;

For instance, a [[pumpkin pie]] can be both hot (out of the oven) and spicy (due to the common inclusion of spices such as [[cinnamon]], [[nutmeg]], [[allspice]], [[mace (spice)|mace]], and [[clove]]s), but it is not ''pungent''. (A food critic may nevertheless use the word "piquant" to describe such a pie, especially if it is exceptionally well-seasoned.) Conversely, pure [[capsaicin]] is pungent, yet it is not naturally accompanied by a hot temperature or spices.

As the [http://oxforddictionaries.com/definition/american_english/piquancy?q=piquancy Oxford], [http://www.collinsdictionary.com/dictionary/english/piquancy?showCookiePolicy=true Collins], and [http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/piquant Merriam-Webster] dictionaries explain, the term "piquancy" refers to mild pungency&lt;ref name="Pungent" /&gt; and flavors and spices that are much less strong than [[Chili pepper|chilli peppers]], including, for example, the strong flavor of some tomatoes. In other words, pungency always refers to a very strong taste whereas piquancy refers to any spices and foods that are "agreeably stimulating to the palate", in other words to food that is spicy in the general sense of "well-spiced".

==Applications==
===In foods===
Pungency is often quantified in scales that range from mild to hot. The [[Scoville scale]] measures the pungency of [[chili pepper]]s, as defined by the amount of [[capsaicin]] they contain.

[[Image:Epice marche Pointe a Pitre.JPG|thumb|left|A display of spices in [[Guadeloupe]]: some pungent, some not]]
Pungency is not considered a taste in the technical sense because it is carried to the brain by a different set of nerves. While taste nerves are activated when consuming foods like chili peppers, the sensation commonly interpreted as "hot" results from the stimulation of [[somatosensory]] fibers in the mouth. Many parts of the body with exposed membranes that lack taste receptors (such as the nasal cavity, genitals, or a wound) produce a similar sensation of heat when exposed to pungent agents.

The pungent sensation provided by chili peppers, [[black pepper]] and other spices like [[ginger]] and [[horseradish]] plays an important role in a diverse range of cuisines across the world, such as [[Korean cuisine|Korean]], [[Iranian cuisine|Persian]], [[Turkish cuisine|Turkish]], [[Tunisian cuisine|Tunisian]], [[Ethiopian cuisine|Ethiopian]], [[Hungarian cuisine|Hungarian]], [[Indian cuisine|Indian]], [[Burmese cuisine|Burmese]], [[Indonesian cuisine|Indonesian]], [[Laotian cuisine|Laotian]],  [[Singaporean cuisine|Singaporean]], [[Malaysian cuisine|Malaysian]], [[Cuisine of Bangladesh|Bangladeshi]], [[Mexican cuisine|Mexican]], [[Peruvian cuisine|Peruvian]], [[Caribbean cuisine|Caribbean]], [[Pakistani cuisine|Pakistani]], Somali cuisine, Southwest Chinese (including [[Sichuan cuisine]]), [[Sri Lankan cuisine|Sri Lankan]], [[Vietnamese cuisine|Vietnamese]], and [[Thai cuisine|Thai]] cuisines.{{ctn|date=July 2013}}

==Mechanism==
The scientific term for the effect of pungency is [[chemesthesis]].  Substances such as [[piperine]] and [[capsaicin]] cause a burning sensation by inducing a [[trigeminal nerve]] reaction together with normal taste reception. The pungent feeling caused by [[allyl isothiocyanate]], capsaicin, piperine, and [[allicin]] is caused by activation of the heat thermo- and chemosensitive [[Transient receptor potential channel|TRP ion channels]] including [[TRPV1]] and [[TRPA1]] [[nociceptor]]s.
The pungency of chilies may be an adaptive response to selection by microbial pathogens.&lt;ref name=PNAS /&gt;

[[Henri Dutilleux]]'s '''Symphony No. 2 ''Le Double''''' is an orchestral work completed in 1959, commissioned by the [[Serge Koussevitzky#Legacy|Koussevitzky Music Foundation]] for the 75th anniversary of the [[Boston Symphony Orchestra]].

It is written for an orchestra and a second group comprising an oboe, a clarinet, a bassoon, a trumpet, a trombone, two violins, a viola, a cello, a harpsichord, a celesta, and kettledrums.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://brahms.ircam.fr/works/work/8326/|title=Symphonie N° 2 "Le Double", Henri Dutilleux|publisher=brahms.ircam.fr|accessdate=6 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview==
The work consists of back and forth between the two instrumental groups, like that of a [[concerto grosso]] although the approach is different: in this piece, the smaller ensemble acts as a mirror or ghost of the larger one, sometimes playing similar or complementary lines, sometimes contrasting ones.&lt;ref&gt;Liner notes from the CD by Simon Marin: Erato 0630-14068-2&lt;/ref&gt;

In Dutilleux's own words:
{{Quote|My work incorporates a rather singular formation. Division into two groups: in the first, 12 musicians chosen amongst the first desk players, disposed in a semi-circle around the conductor; in the second, the entire orchestra. This arrangement can hardly help evoking the traditional concerto grosso, although my ideal in fact has been to escape from this form whose pre-fabricated dimension seems incompatible with contemporary language. I thus endeavoured to avoid the stumbling block of the somewhat archaic form; the twelve musicians of the smaller orchestra considered separately do not constantly play the role of soloists; it is the mass they form that constitutes the solo element. This mass does not merely confront and dialogue with the larger formation, but at times fuses with, or superimposes itself upon the latter, leaving ample opportunity for polyrhyhthmics and polytonality.&lt;ref&gt;''Seen and Heard International'': [http://www.musicweb-international.com/SandH/2008/Jan-Jun08/dutilleux1602.htm Glyn Pursglove, "Concert Review: Dutilleux, Bartok"], accessed 26 May 2013&lt;/ref&gt;
}}

==Structure==

The symphony has three movements, a performance taking around a half-hour.
# ''Animato, ma misterioso''
# ''Andantino sostenuto''
# ''Allegro fuocoso — Calmato''

'''{{lang|it|Tarantella}}''' ({{IPA-it|taranˈtɛlla}}) is a group of various  [[Italian folk dance|folk dances]] characterized by a fast upbeat tempo, usually in [[Time signature|{{music|time|6|8}} time]] (sometimes {{music|time|12|8}} or {{music|time|4|4}}), accompanied by [[tambourine]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Morehead, P.D., ''Bloomsbury Dictionary of Music'', London, Bloomsbury, 1992&lt;/ref&gt; It is among the most recognized forms of traditional southern Italian music. The specific dance-name varies with every region, for instance ''[[tammurriata]]'' in [[Campania]], ''[[pizzica]]'' in the [[Salento]] region, [[Calabrian Tarantella|''Sonu a ballu'']] in Calabria. Tarantella is popular in [[Southern Italy]] and [[Argentina]]. The term may appear as '''{{lang|it|tarantello}}''' in a [[Gender (linguistics)|linguistically masculine]] construction.
&lt;!-- There is mention in the article on Taranto that its name derives from an exorcism ritual, which seems rather improbable.  John T. La Barbera may have picked up a myth here.
The term "tarantella" originally referred to an exorcism ritual that existed in Greece around the year 2000 BC and was connected to the gods [[Dionysus]] and [[Apollo]] (the Greek gods of wine and music). It continued on in [[southern Italy]], an area known as [[Magna Grecia]] (greater Greece).&lt;ref&gt;

== History ==
[[File:Apollon Mokritsky Rim Italyanki na Terrase 1846.jpg|thumb|Italian women dance the tarantella, 1846]]

In the Italian [[province of Taranto]], [[Apulia]], the bite of a locally common type of [[Lycosa tarantula|wolf spider]], named "tarantula" after the region,&lt;ref&gt;[[Linnaeus]] named the spider ''[[Lycosa tarantula]]'' in 1758.&lt;/ref&gt; was popularly believed to be highly venomous and to lead to a hysterical condition known as [[tarantism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article22646978 |title=POISONOUS SPIDER BITES. |newspaper=[[The Queenslander]] |date=8 September 1923 |accessdate=1 September 2013 |page=2 |via=National Library of Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt; This became known as the Tarantella. R. Lowe Thompson proposed that the dance is a survival from a "[[Diana (goddess)|Dianic]] or [[Dionysus|Dionysiac]] cult", driven underground.&lt;ref&gt;R.Lowe Thompson. ''The History of the Devil''. Paul, Trench, Tubner and Co. (1929), p.164.&lt;/ref&gt; John Compton later proposed that the [[Roman Senate]] had suppressed  these ancient [[Bacchanalian]] [[rite]]s. In 186 BC the tarantella went underground, reappearing under the guise of emergency therapy for bite victims.&lt;ref&gt;John Compton. ''The Life of the Spider''. Mentor Books (1954), p. 56f.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Courtship vs tarantism dances==
The stately courtship tarantella danced by a couple or couples, short in duration, is graceful and elegant and features characteristic music.  On the other hand, the supposedly curative or symptomatic tarantella was danced solo by a victim of a ''[[Lycosa tarantula]]'' spider bite (not to be confused with what is commonly known as a [[tarantula]] today); it was agitated in character, lasted for hours or even up to days, and featured characteristic music. However, other forms of the dance were and still are couple dances usually either mimicking courtship or a sword fight. The confusion appears to arrive from the fact that the spiders, the condition, its sufferers ('tarantolati'), and the dances all have similar names to the city of [[Taranto]].&lt;ref name="Toschi"&gt;Toschi, Paolo (1950). Proceedings of the Congress Held in Venice September 7th to 11th, 1949: "A Question about the Tarantella", ''Journal of the International Folk Music Council'', Vol. 2. (1950), p. 19. Translated by N. F.&lt;/ref&gt;

The dance originated in the [[Apulia]] region, and spread throughout the [[Kingdom of the Two Sicilies]].
The Neapolitan tarantella is a [[courtship dance]] performed by couples whose  "rhythms, melodies, gestures, and accompanying songs are quite distinct" featuring faster more cheerful music. Its origins may further lie in "a fifteenth-century fusion between the Spanish [[Fandango]] and the [[Moresca|Moresque]] 'ballo di sfessartia'." 
The "magico-religious" tarantella is a solo dance performed supposedly to cure through perspiration the delirium and contortions attributed to the bite of a spider at harvest (summer) time. The dance was later applied as a supposed cure for the behavior of neurotic women ('Carnevaletto delle donne').&lt;ref name="Ettlinger"&gt;Ettlinger, Ellen (1965). Review of "La Tarantella Napoletana" by Renato Penna (''Rivista di Etnografia''), ''Man'', Vol. 65. (Sep. – Oct., 1965), p. 176.&lt;/ref&gt;

There are several traditional tarantella groups: '[[Cantori di Carpino]]', '[[Officina Zoé]]', 'Uccio Aloisi gruppu', 'Canzoniere Grecanico Salentino', 'Selva Cupina', 'I Tamburellisti di Torrepaduli'.

The tarantella is most commonly played with a [[mandolin]], a guitar, an [[accordion]] and [[tambourines]]. [[Flute]], [[fiddle]], [[trumpet]] and [[clarinet]] are also used.

The tarantella is a dance in which the dancer and the drum player constantly try to upstage each other by playing faster or dancing longer than the other, subsequently tiring one person out first.

==Tarantism==
{{Main|Tarantism}}
Tarantism, as a ritual, has roots in the ancient [[Greek mythology|Greek myths]]. Reportedly, victims who had collapsed or were convulsing would begin to dance with appropriate music and be revived as if a tarantula had bitten them. The music used to treat [[dancing mania]] appears to be similar to that used in the case of tarantism though little is known about either. [[Justus Hecker]] (1795–1850), describes in his work ''Epidemics of the Middle Ages'': &lt;blockquote&gt;A convulsion infuriated the human frame [...]. Entire communities of people would join hands, dance, leap, scream, and shake for hours [...]. Music appeared to be the only means of combating the strange epidemic [...] lively, shrill tunes, played on trumpets and fifes, excited the dancers; soft, calm harmonies, graduated from fast to slow, high to low, prove efficacious for the cure.&lt;ref&gt;Hecker, Justus. Quoted in Sear, H. G. (1939).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt; The music used against spider bites featured drums and clarinets, was matched to the pace of the victim, and is only weakly connected to its later depiction in the tarantellas of [[Frédéric Chopin|Chopin]], [[Franz Liszt|Liszt]], [[Gioachino Rossini|Rossini]], and Heller.&lt;ref&gt;Sear, H. G. (1939). "Music and Medicine", p.45, ''Music &amp; Letters'', Vol. 20, No. 1. (Jan., 1939), pp. 43–54. Note that Sear may mistake the Neapolitan and Apulian tarantellas and that those by Romantic composers to which he refers may have been intended as Neapolitan.&lt;/ref&gt;

While most serious proponents speculated as to the direct physical benefits of the dancing rather than the power of the music a mid-18th century medical textbook gets the prevailing story backwards describing that tarantulas will be compelled to dance by violin music.&lt;ref name="Rishton"/&gt; It was thought that the ''Lycosa tarantula'' [[wolf spider]] had lent the name "tarantula" to [[tarantula|an unrelated family of spiders]], having been the species associated with Taranto, but since ''L. tarantula'' is not inherently deadly,&lt;ref name="Rishton"&gt;[[Tim Rishton|Rishton, Timothy J.]] (1984). "Plagiarism, Fiddles and Tarantulas", ''The Musical Times'', Vol. 125, No. 1696. (Jun., 1984), pp. 325–327.&lt;/ref&gt; the highly venomous Mediterranean black widow, ''[[Latrodectus tredecimguttatus]]'', may have been the species originally associated with Taranto's manual grain harvest.

==''Tarantella'' ballet==
The Balanchine ballet [[Tarantella (ballet)|''Tarantella'']] is set to the  ''[[Grande Tarantelle (Gottschalk)|Grande Tarantelle]] for Piano and Orchestra'', Op. 67 (ca. 1866) by [[Louis Moreau Gottschalk]], reconstructed and orchestrated by [[Hershy Kay]]. The profusion of steps and the quick changes of direction that this brief but explosive pas de deux requires typify the ways in which Balanchine expanded the traditional vocabulary of classical dance.

'''''The Bacchanal of the Andrians''''' is an oil painting by [[Titian]]. It is signed "&lt;small&gt;TICIANUS F&lt;/small&gt;.[aciebat]" and is dated to 1523–1526.&lt;ref name="prado"&gt;{{cite web|title=Enciclopedia online |url=http://www.museodelprado.es/enciclopedia/enciclopedia-on-line/voz/bacanal-de-los-andrios-la/?no_cache=1|work=Bacanal de los andrios|publisher=Museo del Prado|accessdate=2 December 2012|language=Spanish}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The painting is now held at the [[Museo del Prado]] in [[Madrid]], but it was commissioned by [[Alfonso I d'Este, Duke of Ferrara|Alfonso I d'Este]] for his ''[[Camerini d'alabastro]]'' ('chambers of alabaster') in [[Ferrara]].  The decorative programme included other major paintings celebrating [[Bacchus]] and Venus, the gods of wine and love.

''The Bacchanal of the Andrians'' has been admired by other artists including Rubens who copied it.

'''''The Clock Without a Face''''' is [[puzzle book]] by Eli Horowitz and [[Mac Barnett]] with illustrations by Scott Teplin. It was published in 2010 by [[McSweeney's]]. The plot of the book revolves around the theft of 12 jeweled numbers from the face of "the Emerald Khroniker," a cursed clock, and with clues to the thief's identity and the whereabouts of the numbers are included throughout the text and in accompanying pictures. The identity of the thieves is revealed on the last page, but the location of the loot is not. The authors hid 12 actual emerald-studded numbers (crafted by [[Anna Sheffield]]) in locations around the United States, and readers are encouraged to search for them using the clues in the book.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.weeklydig.com/arts-entertainment/words/201005/clock-without-face|title=THE CLOCK WITHOUT A FACE |last=Day|first=David|publisher=Weekly Dig|accessdate=2 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://chicago.timeout.com/articles/books/85263/the-clock-without-a-face-scott-teplin-mac-barnett-eli-horowitz-book-review|title=The Clock Without a Face - Scott Teplin, Mac Barnett, Eli Horowitz - Book Review - Time Out Chicago|last=Messinger|first=Jonathan|work=Time Out Chicago|accessdate=2 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://articles.sfgate.com/2010-04-30/entertainment/20876930_1_book-clock-authors|title=Clues in book will lead to buried treasure|last=Vaziri|first=Aidin|date=April 30, 2010|work=[[San Francisco Chronicle]]|publisher=San Francisco Chronicle|accessdate=2 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="WeSat"&gt;{{cite web|title=   Read This Book And Join The Treasure Hunt|url=https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=127790285|work=NPR|accessdate=12 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Saadi Shirazi}}
The '''Tomb of Saadi''' is a tomb and mausoleum dedicated to the Persian poet [[Saadi Shirazi|Saadi]] in the Iranian city of [[Shiraz]]. Saadi was buried at the end of his life at a [[Khanqah]] at the current location. In the 13th century a tomb built for Saadi by Shams al-Din Juvayni, the vizir of [[Abaqa Khan]]. In the 17th century, this tomb was destroyed. During the reign of [[Karim Khan]]&lt;ref name="stanley"/&gt; was built a mausoleum of two floors of brick and plaster, flanked by two rooms. The current building was built between 1950 and 1952&lt;ref name="baker"/&gt; to a design by the architect Mohsen Foroughi and is inspired by the [[Chehel Sotoun]] with a fusion of old and new architectural elements. Around the tomb on the walls are seven verses of Saadi’s poems.
