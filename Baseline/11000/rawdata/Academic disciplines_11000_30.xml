'''ASTRON''' is the Netherlands Institute for Radio Astronomy. Its main office is in [[Dwingeloo]] in the [[Dwingelderveld National Park]] in the province of Drenthe. ASTRON is part of  [[Nederlandse Organisatie voor Wetenschappelijk Onderzoek|Netherlands Organisation for Scientific Research]] (NWO).

==Goals==
ASTRON's main mission is to make discoveries in radio astronomy happen, via the development of new and innovative technologies, the operation of world-class radio astronomy facilities, and the pursuit of fundamental astronomical research. Engineers and astronomers at ASTRON have an outstanding international reputation for novel technology development, and fundamental research in galactic and extra-galactic astronomy. 

ASTRON's programme has three principal elements:
*The operation of front line observing facilities, including especially the [[Westerbork Synthesis Radio Telescope]] and [[LOFAR]],
* The pursuit of fundamental astronomical research using ASTRON facilities, together with a broad range of other telescopes around the world and space-borne instruments (e.g. Sptizer, HST etc.)
*A strong technology development programme, encompassing both innovative instrumentation for existing telescopes and the new technologies needed for future facilities.

In addition, ASTRON is active in the international science policy arena and is one of the leaders in the international SKA project. The [[Square Kilometre Array]] will be the world’s largest and most sensitive radio telescope with a total collecting area of approximately one square kilometre. The SKA will be built in Southern Africa and in Australia. It is a global enterprise bringing together 11 countries from the 5 continents.

==Observing facilities==
===Radio telescopes===
[[File:Westerbork Synthesis Radio Telescope WSRT (1357-59).jpg|thumb|[[Westerbork Synthesis Radio Telescope]] in 2010]]
ASTRON operates the [[Westerbork Synthesis Radio Telescope]] (WSRT), one of the largest radio telescopes in the world. The WSRT and [[LOFAR|the International LOFAR Telescope (ILT)]] are dedicated to explore the universe at radio frequencies from 8 GHz down to 10 MHz.

In addition to its use as a stand-alone radio telescope, the Westerbork array participates in the European Very Long Baseline Interferometry Network (EVN) of radio telescopes.

ASTRON is the host institute for the [[Joint Institute for VLBI in Europe]] (JIVE). Its primary task is to operate the EVN MkIV VLBI Data Processor (correlator). JIVE also provides a high-level of support to astronomers and the Telescope Network. ASTRON also hosts the NOVA Optical/ Infrared instrumentation group.

==Technology development==
[[File:SKA site, South Africa 2014 45.jpg|thumb|right|Mid-frequency aperture array test site for the SKA, in South Africa]]
Discovery in astronomy goes hand in hand with innovation in technology. ASTRON pursues an proactive programme of technical development, aimed both at providing innovative instrumentation for use on current observing facilities, and at laying the groundwork for future generations of telescopes and signal processing instrumentation.

To these ends, the ASTRON facility in Dwingeloo maintains a well equipped R&amp;D division specializing in the design, prototyping and qualification of:
* Low noise, ambient and cryogenic radio receiver systems (0.2 - 345 GHz)
* Very high speed digital electronics
* Antennas, especially in the array environment
* Advanced instrumentation for use at optical and infrared wavelengths
* Algorithm and software engineering for instrument control and for imaging

'''Alexander Souter''' (14 August 1873 – 17 January 1949&lt;ref&gt;{{BBKL|s/souter_a|band=10|autor= Johannes Madey|artikel= Souter, Alexander|spalten=844-845}}&lt;/ref&gt;) was a [[Scotland|Scottish]] [[biblical scholar]].

==Biography==
Souter was born in [[Perth, Scotland|Perth]], and studied at the [[University of Aberdeen]] and the [[University of Cambridge]]. He subsequently became a [[Latin language|Latin]] assistant at Aberdeen. While at Cambridge he studied under [[J. E. B. Mayor]], whom Souter would credit with influence on his later scholarship.&lt;ref name=speculum&gt;{{cite journal | author = Laistner, M.L.W. |author2= Lowe, E.A.|author3= Ullman, B.L. | title = Alexander Souter (in Memoirs of Fellows and Corresponding Fellows of the Mediaeval Academy) | journal = [[Speculum (journal)|Speculum]] | volume = 25 | issue = 3 | year = 1950 | pages = 418–419 | doi = 10.1017/s0038713400174597 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1903 he was appointed professor of [[New Testament Greek]] and [[Exegesis]] at [[Mansfield College, Oxford]]. In 1911 he moved back to the University of Aberdeen, succeeding [[William Mitchell Ramsay|William Ramsay]] as [[Regius Professor of Humanity]], in which position he remained until his retirement in 1937.&lt;ref name=speculum /&gt;

Upon his retirement, Souter moved back to Oxford, where he became editor-in-chief of the proposed ''[[Oxford Latin Dictionary]]''. The outbreak of World War II prevented its completion within his lifetime, but Souter did publish a smaller work borne of this endeavor, ''Glossary of Later Latin, A.D. 150–600''.&lt;ref name=speculum /&gt;

Souter married Elizabeth Barr Anderson, daughter of Aberdeen Photographer William Blair Anderson. They had three daughters, Isabella Elise Souter (who married Alfred Dixon) born in 1901, Elizabeth Barr Anderson Souter born in 1903 and Alexandra Margaret Souter (known as Peggy, who married Peter Jackson) born in 1908. His brother-in-law was William Blair Anderson, who was Kennedy Professor of Latin at Cambridge University and a leading Latin scholar of his day.

==Scholarship==
Souter's two main interests were in the text of the [[New Testament]] and in early Latin commentaries on the [[Pauline epistles]]. He published an edition of the New Testament in 1910 (revised edition 1947) giving the Greek text on which the English [[Revised Version]] of 1881 was based, along with commentary on variants. His work on the Pauline epistles included proposed revisions to many accepted attributions, notably of [[Ambrosiaster]], as well as numerous commentaries on and editions of other works.&lt;ref name=speculum /&gt; A public lecture is held annually in the University of Aberdeen in memory of this scholar.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10797">The '''Applegate mechanism''' ('''Applegate's mechanism''' or '''Applegate effect''') explains long term orbital period variations seen in certain [[eclipsing binaries]]. As a [[main sequence star]] goes through an activity cycle, the outer layers of the star are subject to a magnetic torque changing the distribution of angular momentum, resulting in a change in the star's oblateness. The orbit of the stars in the binary pair is gravitationally coupled to their shape changes, so that the period shows modulations (typically on the order of ∆P/P ∼ 10&lt;sup&gt;−5&lt;/sup&gt;) on the same time scale as the activity cycles (typically on the order of decades).&lt;ref name="Applegate 1992"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Applegate |first1=James H. |title=A mechanism for orbital period modulation in close binaries|journal=Astrophysical Journal, Part 1 |date=1992 |volume=385 |pages=621–629|bibcode=1992ApJ...385..621A|doi = 10.1086/170967 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Introduction==
Careful timing of eclipsing binaries has shown that systems showing orbital period modulations on the order of ∆P/P ∼ 10&lt;sup&gt;−5&lt;/sup&gt; over a period of decades are quite common. A striking example of such a system is [[Algol]], for which the detailed observational record extends back over two centuries. Over this span of time, a graph of the time dependence of the difference between the observed times of eclipses ''versus'' the predicted times shows a feature (termed the "great inequality") with a full amplitude of 0.3 days and a recurrent time scale of centuries. Superimposed on this feature is a secondary modulation with a full amplitude of 0.06 days and a recurrent time scale of about 30 years. Orbital period modulations of similar amplitude are seen in other [[Algol binaries]] as well.&lt;ref name="Applegate 1992"/&gt;

Although recurrent, these period modulations do not follow a strictly regular cycle. Irregular recurrence rules out attempts to explain these period modulations as being due to [[apsidal precession]] or the presence of distant, unseen companions. Apsidal precession explanations also have the problem that they require an eccentric orbit, but the systems in which these modulations are observed often show orbits of little eccentricity. Furthermore, third body explanations have the issue that in many cases, a third body massive enough to produce the observed modulation should not have managed to escape optical detection, unless the third body were quite exotic.&lt;ref name="Van Buren"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Van Buren |first1=D. |title=Comment on the three-body theory for period changes in RS CVn systems |journal=The Astronomical Journal |date=1986 |volume=92 |pages=136–138 |bibcode=1986AJ.....92..136V|doi = 10.1086/114145 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another phenomenon observed in certain Algol binaries has been monotonic period increases. This is quite distinct from the far more common observations of alternating period increases and decreases explained by the Applegate mechanism. Monotonic period increases have been attributed to mass transfer, usually (but not always) from the less massive to the more massive star&lt;ref name="Hall_1989"/&gt;

==Mechanism==
The time scale and recurrence patterns of these orbital period modulations suggested to Matese and Whitmire (1983) a mechanism invoking changes in the quadrupole moment of one star with subsequent spin-orbit coupling. However, they could not provide any convincing explanation for what might cause such fluctuations in the quadrupole moment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Matese |first1=J. J. |last2=Whitmire |first2=D. P. |title=Alternate period changes in close binary systems |journal=Astronomy and Astrophysics |date=1983 |volume=117 |issue=2 |pages=L7–L9 |bibcode=1983A&amp;A...117L...7M}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Taking the Matese and Whitmire mechanism as a basis, Applegate argued that changes in the radius of gyration of one star could be related to magnetic activity cycles.&lt;ref name="Applegate 1992"/&gt; Supportive evidence for his hypothesis came from the observation that a large fraction of the late-type secondary stars of Algol binaries appear to be rapidly rotating convective stars, implying that they should be chromospherically active. Indeed, orbital period modulations are seen only in Algol-type binaries containing a late-type convective star.&lt;ref name="Hall_1989"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Hall |first1=Douglas S. |title=The relation between RS CVn and Algol |journal=Space Science Reviews |date=1989 |volume=50 |pages=219–233 |bibcode=1989SSRv...50..219H|doi = 10.1007/BF00215932 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Given that gravitational quadrupole coupling is involved in producing orbital period changes, the question remained of how a magnetic field could induce such shape changes. Most models of the 1980s assumed that the magnetic field would deform the star by distorting it away from hydrostatic equilibrium. Marsh and Pringle (1990) demonstrated, however, that the energy required to produce such deformations would exceed the total energy output of the star.&lt;ref name="Marsh and Pringle"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Marsh |first1=T. R. |last2=Pringle |first2=J. E. |title=Changes in the orbital periods of close binary stars |journal=Astrophysical Journal, Part 1 |date=1990 |volume=365 |pages=677–680 | bibcode=1990ApJ...365..677M|doi = 10.1086/169521 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A star does not rotate as a solid body. The outer parts of a star contribute most to a star's quadrupole moment. Applegate proposed that as a star goes through its activity cycle, magnetic torques could cause a redistribution of angular momentum within a star. As a result, the rotational oblateness of the star will change, and this change would ultimately result in changing the orbital period via the Matese and Whitmire mechanism. Energy budget calculations indicate that the active star typically should be variable at the ΔL/L&amp;nbsp;≈&amp;nbsp;0.1 level and should be differentially rotating at the ΔΩ/Ω&amp;nbsp;≈&amp;nbsp;0.01 level.&lt;ref name="Applegate 1992"/&gt;

==Applicability==
The Applegate mechanism makes several testable predictions:
* Luminosity variations in the active star should correspond to modulations in the orbital period.
* Any other indicator of magnetic activity (''i.e.'' sunspot activity, coronal X-ray luminosity, ''etc.'') should also show variations corresponding to modulations in the orbital period.
* Since large changes in the radius of the star are ruled out by considerations of energetics, luminosity variations should be entirely due to temperature variations.&lt;ref name="Applegate 1992"/&gt;

Tests of the above predictions have been supportive of the mechanism's validity, but not unambiguously so.&lt;ref name=Maceroni&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Maceroni|first1=Carla|title=Angular Momentum Evolution in Close Late-type Binaries |journal=Turkish Journal of Physics |date=1999 |volume=23 |issue=2 |pages=289–300 |accessdate=24 May 2015 |url=http://journals.tubitak.gov.tr/physics/issues/fiz-99-23-2/fiz-23-2-2-98073.pdf |bibcode = 1999TJPh...23..289M }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Frasca&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1051/0004-6361:20041007| title = Orbital period variation in close binaries from radial velocity data and magnetic activity cycles| journal = Astronomy and Astrophysics| volume = 429| pages = 309| date = 2005| last1 = Frasca | first1 = A.| last2 = Lanza | first2 = A. F.|bibcode = 2005A&amp;A...429..309F }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Applegate effect provides a unified explanation for many (but not all) ephemeris curves for a wide class of binaries, and it may aid in the understanding of the [[Dynamo theory|dynamo]] activity seen in rapidly rotating stars.&lt;ref name=Hilditch&gt;{{cite book |last1=Hilditch |first1=R. W.|title=An Introduction to Close Binary Stars|date=2001|publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]] |isbn=978-0521798006 |pages=175–176 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=hJSADIxyheoC&amp;pg=PA175 |accessdate=24 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Applegate mechanism has also been invoked to explain variations in the observed transit times of [[extrasolar planet]]s, in addition to other possible effects such as tidal dissipation and the presence of other planetary bodies.&lt;ref name=Watson&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1111/j.1365-2966.2010.16602.x| title = Orbital period variations of hot Jupiters caused by the Applegate effect| journal = Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society| pages = no| date = 2010| last1 = Watson | first1 = C.

However, there are many stars for which the Applegate mechanism is inadequate. For example, the orbital period variations in certain eclipsing post-common-envelope binaries are an order of magnitude larger than can be accommodated by the Applegate effect, with [[magnetic braking]] or a third body in a highly elliptical orbit providing the only known mechanisms able to explain the observed variation.&lt;ref name=Völschow&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1051/0004-6361/201527333| title = Eclipsing time variations in close binary systems: Planetary hypothesis vs. Applegate mechanism| journal=[[Astronomy and Astrophysics]]| volume = 587| issue=34| date = 2016| last1 = Völschow | first1 = M.| last2 = Schleicher | first2 = D.

'''Appreciative listening''' is a type of listening behavior where the listener seeks certain information which they will appreciate, for example that which helps meet his/her needs and goals. One uses appreciative listening when listening to good [[music]], [[poetry]] or maybe even the stirring words of a great leader.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Kline|first=John A.|title=Types of Listening|url=http://www.au.af.mil/au/awc/awcgate/kline-listen/b10ch4.htm|accessdate=18 September 2011 | publisher=Air University Press |location=Maxwell Air Force Base, Alabama | date=April 1996}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| title=A Team Approach to Behaviour Management |page=43 |first1=Chris |last1=Derrington |first2=Barry |last2=Groom |publisher=Paul Chapman Publishing |year=2004 |url=http://childhealthanddevelopment.files.wordpress.com/2011/03/different-types-of-listening.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It involves listening to music that one enjoys, people the listener likes to listen to because of their style and the choices the listener make in the films and television he/she watches, radio programmes and plays and musicals in the theatre.  Unlike [[informative listening]] or [[relationship listening]], appreciative listening does not rely on the message from the speaker it is how one responds as a listener.  Our appreciation of what we hear will vary depending on our individual tastes, but will also be affected by three different factors:

== Presentation ==
There are many different factors that encompass [[presentation]] including the medium, the setting and the style and personality of a presenter. Of course this works both ways and equally you will have been entranced by others because of the force of their personality and their delivery style.

The environment can also impact your appreciation of the presentation. Seating, temperature, clarity and volume of sound will all impact on whether it’s a good or poor experience.

== Perception ==
Perception is an important factor in appreciative listening. As one is exposed to different experiences his/her perceptions can change. For example: individual's taste in music. We need to listen to various [[List of music styles|types of music]] to have a preference over other types and appreciate them. An individual's expectations also affects our perception. 

An individual's perception and expectations are driven by his/her attitudes which determine how he/she reacts to and interact to the world in which he/she lives.

== Previous experience ==
Some of our perceptions are clearly influenced by our previous experience and impact on whether or not we enjoy listening to something, or whether we are even willing to listen. Whether our memories evoke pleasant or unpleasant reminders will affect our appreciation. However, it’s important to remain open to new experiences.  We can develop our appreciative listening skills.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11783">[[Image:Sadlers_Wells_Theatre_edited.jpg|thumb|250px|right|A performance at Sadler's Wells, circa 1808.]]
The [[:Category:Theatrical genres|theatrical genre]] of '''aqua drama''' that was popular in 19th century France, England, and the United States involved flooding the arenas of circuses for recreations of major naval conflicts and similar aquatic events;  some venues participated to such a great extent in this once-popular form as to install permanent water-tanks on stage.&lt;ref name=H17&gt;Harrison, p. 17&lt;/ref&gt; Water-based spectacles, especially those portraying great naval battles, had been popular in Roman times, when they were known as ''[[naumachia]]'', and the custom was resurrected at various times during the [[Middle Ages]].

== Beginning ==
At the start of the 19th century, the already established [[Sadler's Wells Theatre]] came under the management of Charles Dibdin, Jr., a man who had big plans for the theatre's future. In 1804, he installed a large 90x24x3ft water tank that covered the entire stage.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;Jane Austin's World&lt;/ref&gt; The water used to fill the tank was pumped in from the New River, which was adjacent to the theatre, by an Archimedes wheel.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;Arundell p. 72&lt;/ref&gt; This process took twelve men twelve hours: four men would work in four hour shifts and then rotate until the entire tank was full.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Even though the tanks were drained and refilled every three weeks they would become filthy. The water would become dirty not only from the shows, but the actors would bathe in the tank, along with rowdy audience members jumping in to see if the water was real.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;Lewis&lt;/ref&gt; The Aquatic Drama was popular in the early 19th century, and with Sadler's Wells on the outskirts of London, the audiences, especially in the pit were unruly, loud, and most likely drunk.&lt;ref&gt;Goldfarb and Edwin 397&lt;/ref&gt; The large water tank that these disruptive audience members would jump into was not the only tank in the theatre, Dibdin Jr. had a second 5x5x5 ft tank above the theatre that was used to simulate waterfalls.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

==19th century performances==
The first show Dibdin, Jr. and his crew put on was ''The Siege of Gibralter.'' It opened in 1804, and it was a play that depicted the naval battle between the English Navy and the Spanish Armada.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; A playbill from this performance describes the battle in the show:

''"the conflagration of the town in various places, the defense of the garrison, and attack by the floating batteries, [which] is so faithfully and naturally represented, that when the floating batteries take fire, some blowing up with a dreadful explosion, and others, after burning to the water’s edge, sink to the bottom; while the gallant Sir Roger Curtis appears in his boat to save the drowning Spaniards, the British tars for that purpose plunging into the water, the effect is such as to produce an unprecedented climax of astonishment and applause."''&lt;ref&gt;Nicoll p. 43&lt;/ref&gt;

There were 177 ships on the liquid stage, all equipped with live guns and ready for battle.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Over a hundred real scale sized naval ships would not have been able to fit in Sadler's Wells tanks, so Dibdin hired men who worked at the [[Woolwich Dockyard]]s to build him smaller ships built at a one-inch per foot scale, with exact detailed imitation down to the rigging.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Children were cast as some of the Spanish naval officers manning the tiny ships, and were seen “drowning” after the Spanish had been defeated.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; The climactic battle of the show was when the English and Spanish went head on, full force, with guns blazing, and the audience members saw incredible spectacle as the English triumphantly destroyed the Spanish Armada.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;Arundell p. 74&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1823 Sadler's Wells presented the aqua drama entitled ''The Island or Christian and His Comrades'' which dramatized the main events of the [[Mutiny on the Bounty|Mutiny on board HMS ''Bounty'']].&lt;ref name=k55&gt;Kirk, p. 55&lt;/ref&gt; In order to alleviate a twenty-minute delay between a dry land scene and an aquatic scene, the stage was made to ascend to near the roof of the theatre, in full view of the audience.&lt;ref name=L4&gt;Ledger, p. f&lt;/ref&gt;

== The Fall ==
Eventually the aqua drama slash began to ripple then calm as audience members were no longer pleased with what was being performed at Sadler's Wells. This could have been due to the fact that Dibdin, Jr. tried to reuse many of his 177 ships from the ''Siege of Gibraltar,'' and they were no longer new and exciting to the audiences, but also the Napoleonic wars could have contributed.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; According to Dan Cuickshank at BBC News, the Napoleonic wars were raging on during the early 1800s and England dipped its toes in the war waters in 1793 with the new Revolutionary France. After a decade of fighting the two countries finally signed at the Treaty of Amiens, which only lasted a month until in May 1803 war broke out between the two countries again.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;Cuickshank&lt;/ref&gt; The initial declaration of war could have sparked a rise in nationalism with in England, being a contributing factor into the Dibden, Jr. and his aquatic drama's success. Britain was known for having a large and powerful navy, and they didn't mind flexing their muscles as they asserted themselves as the most powerful navy in Europe at the 1815 after their victory at Waterloo.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; The citizens of England would have known how powerful their countries navy was. Seeing shows, such as the ones being put at Sadler's Wells, reminded the English people of how strong their military was, making them feel proud and safe initially. Yet, after a few years into the war the citizens began to realize the horrors of war. According to Mather, they were exposed not only to the death of friends and family along with the fear of invasion, but also the raising of taxes to fund the military.&lt;ref&gt;Mather&lt;/ref&gt; A staggering 11.6 million, which is around 570 million pounds in today's market, was spent on forts alone, most of which were protecting dock yards.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; The British people became fed up with war, especially naval combat and eventually the tanks were taken out of the theatre. Removal of the tanks due to lack of popularity reflects the English nation's view of war.

== Legacy ==
Even though the tanks were removed in 1824, aqua drama was a part of a long lasting theatre's history. The legacy left behind of aquatic theatre is only a few pages in books and websites, and a painting or two, but Sadler's Wells legacy has been alive and well since Richard Sadler first opened his music house in 1683.&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;Crompton&lt;/ref&gt; Since then the theatre has seen many triumphs and tragedies. After Charles Dibdin, Jr. resigned there was a false fire alarm during one of the shows which lead to 18 people being stampeded to death.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

In 1843 the theater was once again successful, as the actor manager Samuel Philips put on Shakespeare's plays. Sadly, in 1915 the doors to Sadler's Wells were closed. Lilian Baylis, who wanted everyone in London to have the privilege to see the mesmerizing art of theatre, raised the money to reopen Sadler's Wells. The Sadler's Wells legacy continued as it was once again able to share theatre's magic with the people of northern London in 1931. After many years of putting on progressive theatre that entertained northern London, the play aspect of Sadler's Wells eventually faded out, opera and dance became prominent. Around 1945 Sadler's Wells started to become a strictly dance performance hall. The theatre legacy was replaced over the next half century as the once music hall become an outstanding, well respected dance hall. Sadler's Wells still stands today, not in the same building, but with the murky water of Charles Dibdin, Jr.’s aquatic theatre running in its historic veins.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;

== New York ==
[[New York City]]'s [[Lafayette Circus (Theatre)|Lafayette Circus]] (1826-1829) boasted equipment for both [[Hippodrama|equestrian, or "Hippodrama"]], and aquatic dramas.&lt;ref name=B1136&gt;Banham, p. 1136&lt;/ref&gt;

On July 4, 1840, The [[Bowery Theatre]] in [[New York City]] produced ''The Pirates Signal''.  An immense stage was entirely covered by water upon which a full-rigged ship maneuvered. The scene took place upon the decks of the ship itself.&lt;ref name=B17&gt;Brown, p. 17&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8209">'''Availability''' is the probability that a system will work as required when required during the period of a mission. The mission could be the 18-hour span of an aircraft flight. The mission period could also be the 3 to 15-month span of a [[military deployment]]. Availability includes non-operational periods associated with reliability, maintenance, and logistics.

This is measured in terms of '''nines'''. Five-9's means less than 5 minutes when the system is not operating correctly over the span of one year.

Availability is only meaningful for supportable systems. As an example, availability of 99.9% means nothing after the only known source stops manufacturing a critical replacement part.

== Definition ==

There are two kinds of availability.
* Operational
* Predicted

Operational availability is presumed to be the same as predicted availability until after operational metrics become available.

===Availability===

Operational availability is based on observations after at least one system has been built. This usually begins with the [[brassboard]] system that is used to complete system development, and continues with the first of kind used for '''live fire test and evaluation''' (LFTE). Organizations responsible for maintenance use this to evaluate the effectiveness of the maintenance philosophy.

:&lt;math&gt; A_o = \frac {T_m}{T_m + T_d} \begin{cases}A_o = Operational \ Availability \\ T_m = Mission \ Duration  \\ T_d = Observed \ Down \ Time \end{cases}&lt;/math&gt;

Predicted availability is based on a model of the system before it is built.

:&lt;math&gt; A_p = \frac {T_m}{T_m + T_d} \begin{cases} A_p = Predicted \ Availability \\ T_m = Mission \ Duration  \\ T_d = Model \ Down \ Time \end{cases}&lt;/math&gt;

Downtime is the total of all of the different contributions that compromise operation. For modeling, these are different aspects of the model, such as human-system interface for MTTR and reliability modeling for MTBF. For observation, these reflect the different areas of the organization, such as maintenance personnel and documentation for MTTR, and manufacturers and shippers for MLDT.

: &lt;math&gt; T_d = T_m \times \frac {MTTR + MLDT + MAMDT}{MTBF} \begin{cases} T_d = Down \ Time \\ T_m = Mission \ Duration \\ MTTR = Mean \ Time \ To \ Recover \\ MLDT = Mean \ Logistics \ Delay \ Time \\ MAMDT = Mean \ Active \ Maintenance \ Down \ Time\\ MTBF = Mean \ Time \ Between \ Failure \end{cases}&lt;/math&gt;

=== MTBF ===

Mean Time Between Failure (MTBF) depends upon the maintenance philosophy.

If a system is designed with both '''redundancy''' ''and'' '''automatic fault bypass''', then MTBF is the anticipated lifespan of the system if these features cover all possible failure modes (infinity for all practical purposes). Such systems will continue without noticeable interruption when these conditions are satisfied unless there are secondary failures. This is called active redundancy, which requires no maintenance to prevent mission failure. Active redundancy is required for systems that cannot be maintained, such as satellites.

If a system has no redundancy, then MTBF is the inverse of [[failure rate]], &lt;math&gt;\lambda&lt;/math&gt;.

:&lt;math&gt; \lambda = \frac{1}{MTBF}&lt;/math&gt;

Systems with spare parts that are energized but that lack automatic fault bypass are not actually redundant because human action is required to restore operation after every failure. This depends upon [[Condition-based maintenance]] and [[Planned Maintenance System]] support.

=== MTTR ===

Mean Time To Recover (MTTR) is the length of time required to restore operation to specification.

This includes three values.
* Mean Time To Discover
* Mean Time To Isolate
* Mean Time To Repair

Mean Time To Discover is the length of time that transpires between when a failure occurs and the system users become aware of the failure. There are two maintenance philosophies associated with Mean Time To Discover.
* [[Condition-based maintenance]] (CBM)
* [[Planned Maintenance System]] (PMS)

CBM works like your car where an oil indicator tells you when oil pressure is too low and a temperature indicator tells you when engine temperature is too high. There is zero time to discover a failure where an indicator is placed in front of a system operator.

PMS is required for silent failures that lack CBM. PMS works is periodic maintenance, like when you perform diagnostic tests on your car every 90 days (or 3,000 miles). A failure may occur any time during the 90 days, such as a broken light, but you will not become aware until you perform diagnostic test.

Mean Time To Discover is statistical when PMS is the dominant maintenance philosophy. For example, if a fault is discovered during PMS diagnostic procedure that is run every 10 days, the average fault duration will be 5 days. This creates a dependency between availability performance and labor costs. There is no such dependency associated with CBM.

Mean Time To Isolate is the average length of time required to identify a setting that needs to be adjusted or a component that needs to be replaced. This is dependent on documentation, training, and technical support. This tends to be less on systems that have CBM because users can begin with the list of items connected to the indicator used to notify users about the fault. This also tends to be less on fully documented systems.

Mean Time To Repair is the average length of time to restore operation. For mission critical systems, this is generally estimated by dividing time required to replace all parts by the number of replaceable parts.

=== MLDT ===

Mean Logistics Delay Time is the average time required to obtain replacement parts from the manufacturer and transport those parts to the work site.

=== MAMDT ===

Mean Active Maintenance Down Time is associated with [[Planned Maintenance System]] support philosophy. This is average amount of time while the system is not 100% operational because of diagnostic testing that requires down time.

For example, an automobile that requires 1 day of maintenance every 90 days has a Mean Active Maintenance Down Time of just over 1%.

This is separate from the type of down time associated with repair activities.

== Nines ==

Availability expectations are described in terms of '''nines'''.

The following table shows the anticipated down-time for different availabilities for a mission time of one year. This is the typical time-span used with commercial systems.

{| class="wikitable"
|-
! 90% !! 99% !! 99.9% !! 99.99% !! 99.999% !! 99.9999%
|-
| 40 days || 4 days || 9 hours || 50 minutes || 5 minutes  || 30 seconds
|}

== Supportability ==

Systems that require maintenance are said to be supportable if they satisfy the following criteria.
* Adequate labor for PMS diagnostics or fault indicators for failure modes that lack PMS
* Access to manufacturing sources for replacement parts
* Sufficient resources to sustain access to replacement parts and maintenance labor (money, lodging, ...)
* Training and maintenance documentation suitable to restore operation
* Transportation services to deliver replacement parts

Systems that lack any of these requirements are said to be unsupportable.

== Mission Failure ==

Mission failure is the result of trying to use a system in its normal mode when it is not working.

:&lt;math&gt;P_F = 1 - A_o \begin{cases} P_F = Probability \ of \ Mission \ Failure \\ A_o = Operational \ Availability \end{cases}&lt;/math&gt;

Apart from human error, mission failure results from the following causes.
* Lack of instrumentation for the fault in the form of an indicator suitable for CBM
* Failure after PMS diagnostic testing has been completed but before operation is attempted
* Lack of diagnostic PMS testing for any failure mode that lacks CBM

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7134">'''Bioelectrodynamics''' is a branch of [[medical physics]] and [[bioelectromagnetism]] which deals with rapidly changing [[electric]] and [[magnetic]] fields in biological systems, i.e. high frequency [[endogenous]] electromagnetic phenomena in living cells. Unlike the events studied by the [[electrophysiology]], the generating mechanism of bioelectrodynamic phenomenon is not connected with currents of ions and its frequency is typically much higher. Examples include vibrations of electrically polar intracellular structures and non-thermal emission of [[photon]]s as a result of [[metabolic]] activity.

==Theories and Hypotheses==

Plenty of theoretical work was published on theories and hypotheses describing generation of [[electromagnetic field]] by living cells in very broad frequency range.&lt;ref&gt;Priel A, Tuszynski JA, Cantiello HF (2005). "Electrodynamic signaling by the dendritic cytoskeleton: toward an intracellular information processing model", ''Electromagnetic Biology and Medicine'', 24 (3).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Cifra M (2012). [https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biosystems.2012.06.003 Electrodynamic eigenmodes in cellular morphology] ''BioSystems'', 109 (3).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Uesakaa M, Zhoua S-A (2006). "Bioelectrodynamics in living organisms", ''International Journal of Engineering Science'', 44 (1-2).&lt;/ref&gt; The most influential one was once probably the Fröhlich's hypothesis of coherence in biological systems introduced by [[Herbert Fröhlich]] in the late 1960s.&lt;ref&gt;GJ Hyland and Peter Rowlands (editors) ''Herbert Frohlich FRS: A Physicist Ahead of his Time.'' (University of Liverpool, 2006, 2nd edition 2008.) {{ISBN|978-0-906370-57-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite the fact that experimental evidence for Fröhlich's hypothesis does not exist yet, numerical estimates indicate biological feasibility of at least Fröhlich's weak condensation.&lt;ref&gt;Reimers J et al. (2009). [https://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.0806273106 Weak, strong, and coherent regimes of Fröhlich condensation and their applications to terahertz medicine and quantum consciousness] ''PNAS'' 106 (11).&lt;/ref&gt;

Recent theoretical considerations predict generation of [[radio frequency]] electromagnetic field in cells as a result of  vibrations of electrically polar intracellular structures, e. g., [[microtubule]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Pokorný J, Hašek J, Jelínek F (2005). [https://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10867-005-1286-1 Electromagnetic field of microtubules: Effects on transfer of mass particles and electrons] ''J. Biol. Phys.'' 31.&lt;/ref&gt; Emission in optical part of [[electromagnetic spectrum]] is usually attributed to [[reactive oxygen species]] (ROS).

==Experimental evidence==
Bioelectrodynamic effects were experimentally proven in optical range of electromagnetic spectrum. Spontaneous emission of photons by living cells, with intensity significantly higher than  corresponds to emission by thermal radiation, was repeatedly reported by several authors over decades.&lt;ref&gt;Cifra M, Fields JZ, Farhadi A (2011). [https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.pbiomolbio.2010.07.003 Electromagnetic cellular interactions] ''Progress in Biophysics and Molecular Biology'', 105 (3).&lt;/ref&gt; These observations exhibit experimental simplicity and good reproducibility. Although non-thermal emission of photons from living cells is generally accepted phenomenon, much less is known about its origin and properties. On the one hand, it is sometimes attributed to [[chemiluminescent]] metabolic reactions (including for instance [[reactive oxygen species]] (ROS) &lt;ref&gt;Prasad A, Pospisil P (2011) [https://dx.doi.org/10.1002/jbio.201100073 Two-dimensional imaging of spontaneous ultra-weak photon emission from the human skin: role of reactive oxygen species] ''Journal of Biophotonics'', 4 (11-12).&lt;/ref&gt; ), on the other hand, some authors relate this phenomenon to far-from-equilibrium thermodynamics.{{citation needed|date=November 2012}}

Indirect evidence exists on acoustic and radio frequencies; however, direct measurement of field quantities is missing. Pohl and others observed force effect on dielectric particles which were attracted to cells and repulsed from cells, respectively, depending on particles' dielectric constant.&lt;ref&gt;Pohl HA, Crane JS (1971). [https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S0006-3495(71)86249-5 Dielectrophoresis of Cells] ''Biophysical Journal'' 11.&lt;/ref&gt; Pohl attributed this behavior to [[dielectrophoresis]] caused by electromagnetic field of cells. He estimated the frequency of this field as about hundreds of MHz. Other indirect evidence comes from the fact that mechanical vibrations were experimentally proven in very broad frequency range in cells.&lt;ref&gt;Kruse K, Juelicher F (2005). [https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ceb.2004.12.007 Oscillations in cell biology] ''Curr. Opin. Cell Biol.'' 17 (1).&lt;/ref&gt; Since many structures in cells are electrically polar, they will generate electromagnetic field if they vibrate.&lt;ref&gt;Kucera O, Havelka D (2005). [https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biosystems.2012.04.009 Mechano-electrical vibrations of microtubules—Link to subcellular morphology] ''BioSystems'' 109 (3).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Controversy==

As a question opened for decades, bioelectrodynamics was not always part of scientific mainstream and thus it was sometimes treated with poor scientific standards. This is particularly true for:

# - overestimation of the significance of experimental data obtained (Kucera&lt;ref&gt;Kucera O, Cifra M, Porkorny J (2010). [https://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00249-010-0597-8 Technical aspects of measurement of cellular electromagnetic activity] ''European Biophysics Journal'' 39 (10).&lt;/ref&gt; argues that claims by several authors about direct measurement of cellular electromagnetic activity in radio-frequency band should be accepted with skepticism since technical properties of experimental setups have not even met criteria arising from optimistic theoretical biophysical predictions. Firstly, spatial resolution of used sensors was too low with respect to expected spatial complexity of electromagnetic field in cells. Secondly, the sensitivity of experimental setups was not high enough compared to power available in living cell.),
# - misinterpretation of experimental data ([[Fritz-Albert Popp]]'s claim about [[coherence (physics)|coherence]] of photo-emission from cells&lt;ref&gt;Popp FA (1999) [http://www.stealthskater.com/Documents/Consciousness_31.pdf About the Coherence of Biophotons 1999] ''Proceedings of an International Conference on Macroscopic Quantum Coherence'', Boston University.&lt;/ref&gt; is based on statistical distribution of photon counts; however, this is not proof of coherence. Coherent emission (see [[coherent states]]) has [[Poisson distribution]], but Poisson distribution is not exclusively related only to coherent processes.) and
# - development of uncorroborated hypotheses .{{citation needed|date=November 2012}}

'''Biological network inference''' is the process of making [[inference]]s and predictions about [[biological network]]s.

==Biological networks==
A network is a set of nodes and a set of directed or undirected edges between the nodes. Many types of biological networks exist, including transcriptional, signalling and metabolic. Few such networks are known in anything approaching their complete structure, even in the simplest [[bacteria]]. Still less is known on the parameters governing the behavior of such networks over time, how the networks at different levels in a cell interact, and how to predict the complete state description of a [[eukaryote|eukaryotic]] cell or bacterial organism at a given point in the future. [[Systems biology]], in this sense, is still in its infancy.

There is great interest in [[network medicine]] for the [[modelling biological systems]]. This article focuses on a necessary prerequisite to dynamic modeling of a network: inference of the [[topology]], that is, prediction of the "wiring diagram" of the network. More specifically, we focus here on inference of biological network structure using the growing sets of high-throughput expression data for [[gene]]s, [[protein]]s, and [[metabolism|metabolites]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Tieri P, Farina L, Petti M, Astolfi L, Paci P, Castiglione F | title = Network Inference and Reconstruction in Bioinformatics | journal = Encyclopedia of Bioinformatics and Computational Biology | volume = 2 | pages = 805-813 | date = 2018 | doi = 10.1016/B978-0-12-809633-8.20290-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Briefly, methods using high-throughput data for inference of regulatory networks rely on searching for patterns of partial correlation or conditional probabilities that indicate causal influence.&lt;ref name="Marbach2012"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Marbach D, Costello JC, Küffner R, Vega NM, Prill RJ, Camacho DM, Allison KR, Kellis M, Collins JJ, Stolovitzky G | title = Wisdom of crowds for robust gene network inference | journal = Nature Methods | volume = 9 | issue = 8 | pages = 796–804 | date = August 2012 | pmid = 22796662 | pmc = 3512113 | doi = 10.1038/nmeth.2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book  | vauthors = Sprites P, Glamour C, Scheines R | year = 2000 | title = Causation, Prediction, and Search: Adaptive Computation and Machine Learning | edition = 2nd | publisher = [[MIT Press]] | isbn = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Such patterns of partial correlations found in the high-throughput data, possibly combined with other supplemental data on the genes or proteins in the proposed networks, or combined with other information on the organism, form the basis upon which such [[algorithm]]s work. Such algorithms can be of use in inferring the topology of any network where the change in state of one [[Node (networking)|node]] can affect the state of other nodes.

===Transcriptional regulatory networks===
Genes are the nodes and the edges are directed. A gene serves as the source of a direct regulatory edge to a target gene by producing an [[RNA]] or protein molecule that functions as a transcriptional activator or inhibitor of the target gene. If the gene is an activator, then it is the source of a positive regulatory connection; if an inhibitor, then it is the source of a negative regulatory connection. Computational algorithms take as primary input data measurements of [[mRNA]] expression levels of the genes under consideration for inclusion in the network, returning an estimate of the network [[topology]]. Such algorithms are typically based on linearity, independence or normality assumptions, which must be verified on a case-by-case basis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Oates CJ, Mukherjee S | title = Network Inference and Biological Dynamics | journal = The Annals of Applied Statistics | volume = 6 | issue = 3 | pages = 1209–1235 | date = September 2012 | pmid = 23284600 | doi = 10.1214/11-AOAS532 | last-author-amp = yes | arxiv = 1112.1047 | pmc=3533376}}&lt;/ref&gt; Clustering or some form of statistical classification is typically employed to perform an initial organization of the high-throughput mRNA expression values derived from microarray experiments, in particular to select sets of genes as candidates for network nodes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Guthke R, Möller U, Hoffmann M, Thies F, Töpfer S | title = Dynamic network reconstruction from gene expression data applied to immune response during bacterial infection | journal = Bioinformatics | volume = 21 | issue = 8 | pages = 1626–34 | date = April 2005 | pmid = 15613398 | doi = 10.1093/bioinformatics/bti226 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The question then arises: how can the clustering or classification results be connected to the underlying biology? Such results can be useful for pattern classification – for example, to classify subtypes of [[cancer]], or to predict differential responses to a [[drug]] (pharmacogenomics). But to understand the relationships between the genes, that is, to more precisely define the influence of each gene on the others, the scientist typically attempts to reconstruct the transcriptional regulatory network. This can be done by data integration in dynamic models supported by background literature, or information in public [[database]]s, combined with the clustering results.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Hecker M, Lambeck S, Toepfer S, van Someren E, Guthke R | title = Gene regulatory network inference: data integration in dynamic models-a review | journal = Bio Systems | volume = 96 | issue = 1 | pages = 86–103 | date = April 2009 | pmid = 19150482 | doi = 10.1016/j.biosystems.2008.12.004 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The modelling can be done by a [[Boolean network]], by [[Ordinary differential equation]]s or [[Linear regression]] models, e.g. [[Least-angle regression]], by [[Bayesian network]] or based on [[Information theory]] approaches.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = van Someren EP, Wessels LF, Backer E, Reinders MJ | title = Genetic network modeling | journal = Pharmacogenomics | volume = 3 | issue = 4 | pages = 507–25 | date = July 2002 | pmid = 12164774 | doi = 10.1517/14622416.3.4.507 }}&lt;/ref&gt; For instance it can be done by the application of a correlation-based inference algorithm, as will be discussed below, an approach which is having increased success as the size of the available microarray sets keeps increasing &lt;ref name="Marbach2012" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Faith JJ, Hayete B, Thaden JT, Mogno I, Wierzbowski J, Cottarel G, Kasif S, Collins JJ, Gardner TS | title = Large-scale mapping and validation of Escherichia coli transcriptional regulation from a compendium of expression profiles | journal = PLoS Biology | volume = 5 | issue = 1 | pages = e8 | date = January 2007 | pmid = 17214507 | pmc = 1764438 | doi = 10.1371/journal.pbio.0050008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Hayete B, Gardner TS, Collins JJ | title = Size matters: network inference tackles the genome scale | journal = Molecular Systems Biology | volume = 3 | issue = 1 | pages = 77 | year = 2007 | pmid = 17299414 | pmc = 1828748 | doi = 10.1038/msb4100118 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Signal transduction===
[[Signal transduction]] networks (very important in the biology of cancer). Proteins are the nodes and directed edges represent interaction in which the biochemical conformation of the child is modified by the action of the parent (e.g. mediated by [[phosphorylation]], ubiquitylation, methylation, etc.). Primary input into the inference algorithm would be data from a set of experiments measuring protein activation / inactivation (e.g., phosphorylation / dephosphorylation) across a set of proteins. Inference for such signalling networks is complicated by the fact that total concentrations of signalling proteins will fluctuate over time due to transcriptional and translational regulation. Such variation can lead to statistical [[confounding]]. Accordingly, more sophisticated statistical techniques must be applied to analyse such datasets.&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite journal | vauthors = Oates CJ, Mukherjee S | year = 2012 | title = Structural inference using nonlinear dynamics | journal = CRiSM Working Paper | volume = 12 | issue = 7 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Metabolic===
[[Metabolite]] networks. Metabolites are the nodes and the edges are directed. Primary input into an algorithm would be data from a set of experiments measuring metabolite levels.

===Protein-protein interaction===
Protein-protein interaction networks are also under very active study. However, reconstruction of these networks does not use correlation-based inference in the sense discussed for the networks already described (interaction does not necessarily imply a change in protein state), and a description of such interaction network reconstruction is left to other articles.

A '''boundary problem''' in analysis is a phenomenon in which geographical patterns are differentiated by the shape and arrangement of boundaries that are drawn for administrative or measurement purposes.  This is distinct from and must not be confused with the boundary problem in the philosophy of science that is also called the '''[[demarcation problem]]'''.

== Definition ==
In '''[[spatial analysis]]''', four major problems interfere with an accurate estimation of the statistical parameter: the boundary problem, scale problem, pattern problem (or [[spatial autocorrelation]]), and [[modifiable areal unit problem]] (Barber 1988). The boundary problem occurs because of the loss of neighbours in analyses that depend on the values of the neighbours. While geographic phenomena are measured and analyzed within a specific unit, identical spatial data can appear either dispersed or clustered depending on the boundary placed around the data. In analysis with point data, dispersion is evaluated as dependent of the boundary. In analysis with area data, statistics should be interpreted based upon the boundary.

In geographical research, two types of areas are taken into consideration in relation to the boundary: an area surrounded by fixed natural boundaries (e.g., coastlines or streams), outside of which neighbours do not exist (Henley 1981), or an area included in a larger region defined by arbitrary artificial boundaries (e.g., an air pollution boundary in modeling studies or an urban boundary in population migration) (Haining 1990). In an area isolated by the natural boundaries, the spatial process discontinues at the boundaries. In contrast, if a study area is delineated by the artificial boundaries, the process continues beyond the area.

If a spatial process in an area occurs beyond a study area or has an interaction with neighbours outside artificial boundaries, the most common approach is to neglect the influence of the boundaries and assume that the process occurs at the internal area. However, such an approach leads to a significant model misspecification problem (Upton and Fingleton 1985).

That is, for measurement or administrative purposes, geographic boundaries are drawn, but the boundaries per se can bring about different spatial patterns in geographic phenomena (BESR 2002). It has been reported that the difference in the way of drawing the boundary significantly affects identification of the spatial distribution and estimation of the statistical parameters of the spatial process (Cressie 1992; Fotheringham and Rogerson 1993; Griffith 1983; Martin 1987). The difference is largely based on the fact that spatial processes are generally unbounded or fuzzy-bounded (Leung 1987) but the processes are expressed in data imposed within boundaries for analysis purposes (Miller 1999). Although the boundary problem was discussed in relation to artificial and arbitrary boundaries, the effect of the boundaries also occurs according to natural boundaries as long as it is ignored that properties at sites on the natural boundary such as streams are likely to differ from those at sites within the boundary (Martin 1989).

The boundary problem occurs with regard not only to horizontal boundaries but also to vertically drawn boundaries according to delineations of heights or depths (Pineda 1993). For example, biodiversity such as the density of species of plants and animals is high near the surface, so if the identically divided height or depth is used as a spatial unit, it is more likely to find fewer number of the plant and animal species as the height or depth increases.

== Types and examples ==

By drawing a boundary around a study area, two types of problems in measurement and analysis takes place (Fotheringham and Rogerson 1993). The first is an '''edge effect'''. This effect originates from the ignorance of interdependences that occur outside the bounded region. Griffith (1980; 1983) and Griffith and Amrhein (1983) highlighted problems according to the edge effect. A typical example is a cross-boundary influence such as cross-border jobs, services and other resources located in a neighbouring municipality (McGuire 1995).

The second is a '''shape effect''' that results from the artificial shape delineated by the boundary. As an illustration of the effect of the artificial shape, point pattern analysis tends to provide higher levels of clustering for the identical point pattern within a unit that is more elongated (Fotheringham and Rogerson 1993). Similarly, the shape can influence interaction and flow among spatial entities (Arlinghaus and Nystuen 1990; Ferguson and Kanaroglou 1998; Griffith 1982). For example, the shape can affect the measurement of origin-destination flows since these are often recorded when they cross an artificial boundary. Because of the effect set by the boundary, the shape and area information is used to estimate travel distances from surveys (Rogerson 1990) or to locate traffic counters, travel survey stations, or traffic monitoring systems (Kirby 1997). From the same perspective, Theobald (2001; retrieved from BESR 2002) argued that measures of urban sprawl should consider interdependences and interactions with nearby rural areas.

In spatial analysis, the boundary problem has been discussed along with the [[modifiable areal unit problem]] (MAUP) inasmuch as MAUP is associated with the arbitrary geographic unit and the unit is defined by the boundary (Rogerson 2006). For administrative purposes, data for policy indicators are usually aggregated within larger units (or enumeration units) such as census tracts, school districts, municipalities and counties. The artificial units serve the purposes of taxation and service provision. For example, municipalities can effectively respond to the need of the public in their jurisdictions. However, in such spatially aggregated units, spatial variations of detailed social variables cannot be identified. The problem is noted when the average degree of a variable and its unequal distribution over space are measured (BESR 2002).

[[Image:Christaller's central place theory animation.gif|thumb|right]]
'''Central place theory''' is a [[geography|geographical]] [[theory]] that seeks to explain the number, size and location of [[human settlement]]s in a [[residential system]].&lt;ref name="Dictionary"&gt;Goodall, B. (1987) The Penguin Dictionary of Human Geography. London: Penguin.&lt;/ref&gt; The theory was created by the [[Germany|German]] geographer [[Walter Christaller]], who asserted that settlements simply functioned as 'central places' providing services to surrounding areas.&lt;ref name="Dictionary"/&gt;

==Building the Theory ==
To develop the theory, Christaller made the following simplifying assumptions:&lt;ref&gt;http://uprav.ff.cuni.cz/?q=system/files/christaller.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

All areas have:
* an unbounded [[isotropic]] (all flat), homogeneous, limitless surface ([[abstract space]])
* an evenly distributed population
* all settlements are equidistant and exist in a triangular lattice pattern
* evenly distributed resources
* distance decay mechanism
* perfect competition and all sellers are economic people maximizing their profits
* consumers are of the same income level and same shopping behaviour
* all [[consumer]]s have a similar purchasing power and demand for goods and services
* Consumers visit the nearest central places that provide the function which they demand. They minimize the distance to be travelled
* no provider of goods or services is able to earn excess profit (each supplier has a monopoly over a hinterland)
Therefore, the trade areas of these central places who provide a particular good or service must all be of equal size
* there is only one type of transport and this would be equally easy in all directions
* transport cost is proportional to distance traveled in example, the longer the distance traveled, the higher the transport cost()

The theory then relied on two concepts: ''threshold'' and ''range''. 
*[[Threshold population|Threshold]] is the minimum market (population or income) needed to bring about the selling of a particular good or service.
*Range is the maximum distance consumers are prepared to travel to acquire goods - at some point the cost or inconvenience will outweigh the need for the good.

The result of these consumer preferences is that a system of centers of various sizes will emerge. Each center will supply particular types of goods forming levels of hierarchy.  In the functional hierarchies, generalizations can be made regarding the spacing, size and function of settlements.

#The larger the settlements are in size, the fewer in number they will be, i.e. there are many small villages, but few large cities.
#The larger the settlements grow in size, the greater the distance between them, i.e. villages are usually found close together, while cities are spaced much further apart.
#As a settlement increases in size, the range and number of its functions will increase .
#As a settlement increases in size, the number of higher-order services will also increase, i.e. a greater degree of specialization occurs in the services.

The higher the order of the goods and services (more durable,Heidi valuable and variable), the larger the range of the goods and services, the longer the distance people are willing to travel to acquire them.

At the base of the hierarchy pyramid are shopping centres, newsagents etc. which sell low order goods. These centres are small. At the top of the pyramid are centres selling high order goods. These centres are large. Examples for low order goods and services are: newspaper stalls, groceries, bakeries and post offices. Examples for high order goods and services include jewelry, large shopping malls and arcades. They are supported by a much larger threshold population and demand.

==Predictions==
He deduced that settlements would tend to form in a triangular/hexagonal lattice, as it is the most efficient pattern to serve areas without any overlap.&lt;ref name="Dictionary"/&gt;

In the orderly arrangement of an urban hierarchy, seven different principal orders of settlement have been identified by Christaller, providing different groups of goods and services. Settlement are regularly spaced - equidistant spacing between same order centers, with larger centers farther apart than smaller centers. Settlements have hexagonal market areas, and are most efficient in number and functions.

The different layouts predicted by Christaller have ''K''-values which show how much the Sphere of Influence of the central places takes in &amp;mdash; the central place itself counts as 1 and each portion of a satellite counts as its portion:

=== ''K'' = 3 Marketing principle ===
[[Image:Christaller model 1.svg|thumb|right|100px|''K'' = 3 Principle]]
According to the marketing principle ''K'' = 3, the market area of a higher-order place(node) occupies 1/3rd of the market area of each of the consecutive lower size place(node) which lies on its neighbor; the lower size nodes (6 in numbers and 2nd larger circles) are located at the corner of a largest hexagon around low value the high-order settlement.  Each high-order settlement gets 1/3rd of each satellite settlement (which are 6 in total), thus ''K'' = 1&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;6&amp;times;1/3 = 3.

However, although in this ''K'' = 3 marketing network the distance traveled is minimized, the transport network is not the

=== ''K'' = 4 Transport/Traffic principle ===
[[Image:Christaller model2.jpg|thumb|right|100px|''K'' = 4 Principle]]
According to ''K'' = 4 transport principle, the market area of a higher-order place includes a half of the market area of each of the six neighbouring lower-order places, as they are located on the edges of hexagons around the high-order settlements. This generates a hierarchy of central places which results in the most efficient transport network. There are maximum central places possible located on the main transport routes connecting the higher order center.The transportation principle involves the minimization of the length of roads connecting central places at all hierarchy levels. In this system of nesting, the lower order centres are all located along the roads linking the higher order centres. This alignment of places along a road leads to minimization of road length. However, for each higher order centre, there are now four centres of immediate lower order,as opposed to three centres under the marketing principle.

=== ''K'' = 7 Administrative principle ===
[[Image:Christaller model 3.jpg|thumb|right|100px|''K'' = 7 Principle]]
According to ''K'' = 7 administrative principle (or political-social principle), settlements are nested according to sevens. The market areas of the smaller settlements are completely enclosed within the market area of the larger settlement.  Since tributary areas cannot be split administratively, they must be allocated exclusively to a single higher-order place. Efficient administration is the control principle in this hierarchy.

==Evaluation==

The validity of the place theory may vary with local factors, such as climate, topography, history of development, technological improvement and personal preference of consumers and suppliers. However, it is still possible to discern Christaller patterns in most distributions of urban centres, even though these patterns will often be distorted by the terrain or imperfect because of suboptimal (with regard to the optimal distribution of centres) historical development decisions.

Economic status of consumers in an area is also important. Consumers of higher economic status tend to be more mobile and therefore bypass centers providing only lower order goods. The application of central place theory must be tempered by an awareness of such factors when planning shopping center space location.

Purchasing power and density affect the spacing of centers and hierarchical arrangements. Sufficient densities will allow, for example, a grocery store, a lower order function, to survive in an isolated location.

Factors shaping the extent of market areas: 
*  [[Land use]]: industrial areas can provide little in the way of a consuming population
*  Poor [[accessibility]]: this can limit the extent of a center's market area
* [[Competition]]: this limits the extent of market areas in all directions
* [[Technology]]: high mobility afforded by the automobile allows overlapping of market areas

Market area studies provide another technique for using central place theory as a retail location planning tool. The hierarchy of shopping centers has been widely used within the planning of "[[new town]]s". In this new town, the hierarchy of business centers is evident. One main [[shopping center]] provides mostly [[Durable good|durable goods]] (higher order); district and local shopping centers supply, increasingly, convenience (lower order) goods. These centers provided for in the new town plan are not free from outside competition. The impacts of surrounding existing centers on the new town centers cannot be ignored.

==Examples==
The newly reclaimed [[polders]] of the [[Netherlands]] provide an isotropic plane on which settlements have developed and in certain areas 6 small towns can be seen surrounding a larger town, especially in the Noord-Oostpolder and Flevoland.
The [[The Fens|Fens]] of [[East Anglia]] in the UK also provide a large expanse of flat land with no natural barriers to settlement development.  [[Cambridge]] is a good example of a K=4 Transport Model Central Place, although it is surrounded by 7, rather than 6, settlements.  Each satellite is 10–15 miles from Cambridge and each lies on a major road leading out of Cambridge:
* [[Ely, Cambridgeshire|Ely]] - A10 north

As all of the satellite settlements are on transport links, this is a good example of a K=4 CPT model (although in this case it is K=4.5 due to 7 rather than 6 settlements).

Another example of the use of CPT was in the delineation of Medical Care Regions in California.  A hierarchy of primary, secondary and tertiary care cities was described,
and the population size and income needed to support each medical care specialty in California determined.

== Criticism ==
The Central Place Theory has been criticized for being static; it does not incorporate the temporal aspect in the development of central places. Furthermore, the theory holds up well when it comes to agricultural areas, but not industrial or postindustrial areas due to their diversified nature of various services or their varied distribution of natural resources.

== Newer developments: a dynamic concept for CPT ==
Newer theoretical developments have shown that it is possible to overcome the static aspect of CPT. Veneris (1984) developed a theoretical model which starts with (a) a system of evenly distributed ("medieval") towns; (b) new economic activities are located in some towns thus causing differentiation and evolution into an hierarchical ("industrial") city system; (c) further differentiation leads into a post-hierarchical ("postindustrial") city system.
This evolution can be modelled by means of the three major CPT theories: stage (a) is a system of von Thunen "isolated states"; stage (b) is a Christallerian hierarchical system; stage (c) is a Löschian post-hierarchical system. Furthermore, stage (b) corresponds to [[Christopher Alexander]]'s "tree" city, while (c) is similar to his "lattice" system (following his dictum "the city is not a tree").

==The importance of a City and other Theoretical Considerations==
According to Smith, Walter Christaller erred in his development of CPT in 1930 by using size of population and number of telephones in determining the importance of a city.  Smith recognized that although population size was important to the area served by a city, the '''number of kinds of services''' offered there was more important as a measure of the importance of a city in attracting consumers.  In applying CPT to describe the delivery of medical care in California, Smith counted the number of physician specialties to determine the importance of a city in the delivery of medical care.

Christaller also erred in the assumption that cities "emerge".  In California and much of the United States, many cities were situated by the railroads at the time the tracks were laid.  In California, towns founded by the railroads were 12 miles apart, the amount of track a section crew could maintain in the 1850s; larger towns were 60 miles apart, the distance a steam engine could travel before needing water.  Older towns were founded a day's horse ride apart by the Spanish priests who founded early missions.

In medical care regions described by Smith, there is a hierarchy of services, with primary care ideally distributed throughout an area, middle sized cities offering secondary care, and metropolitan areas with tertiary care.  Income, size of population, population demographics, distance to the next service center, all had an influence on the number and kind of specialists located in a population center. (Smith, 1977, 1979)

For example, orthopedic surgeons are found in ski areas, obstetricians in the suburbs, and boutique specialties such as hypnosis, plastic surgery, psychiatry are more likely to be found in high income areas. It was possible to estimate the size of population (threshold) needed to support a specialty, and also to link specialties that needed to cooperate and locate near each other, such as hematology, oncology, and pathology, or cardiology, thoracic surgery and pulmonology.

Her work is important for the study of physician location—where physicians choose to practice and where their practices will have a sufficient population size to support them. The income level of the population determines whether sufficient physicians will practice in an area and whether public subsidy is needed to maintain the health of the population.

The distribution of medical care in California followed patterns having to do with the settlement of cities.  Cities and their hinterlands having characteristics of the Traffic Principle (See K=4 above) usually have six thoroughfares through them—the thoroughfares including highways, rivers, railroads, and canals.  They are most efficient and can deliver the lowest cost services because transportation is cheaper.  Those having settled on the market principle (K=3 above) have more expensive services and goods, as they were founded at times when transportation was more primitive.  In Appalachia, for example, the market principle still prevails and rural medical care is much more expensive.

== Making Central Place Theory operational ==
CPT is often criticized as being "unrealistic". However, several studies show that it can describe existing urban systems.  An important issue is that Christaller's original formulation is incorrect in several ways (Smith). These errors become apparent if we try to make CPT "operational", that is if we try to derive numerical data out of the theoretical schemata. These problems have been identified for by Veneris (1984) and subsequently by Openshaw and Veneris (2003), who provided also theoretically sound and consistent solutions, based on a K=3, 37-centre CP system:

1. Closure problem. Christaller's original scheme implies an infinite landscape. Although each market has finite size, the total system has no boundaries to it. Neither Christaller, nor the early related literature provide any guidance as to how the system can be "contained". Openshaw and Veneris (2003) identified three different types of closure, namely (a) isolated state, (b) territorial closure and (c) functional closure. Each closure type implies different population patterns.

2. Generating trips. Following the basic Christallerian logic and the closure types identified, Openshaw and Veneris (2003) calculate trip patterns between the 27 centres.

3. Calculating inter- and intra-zonal costs/distances. Christaller assumed freedom of movement in all directions, which would imply "airline" distances between centres. At the same time, he provided specific road networks for the CP system, which do not allow for airline distances. This is a major flaw which neither Christaller, nor early related literature have identified.  Openshaw and Veneris (2003) calculate costs/distances which are consistent with the Christallerian principles.

=== Central Place Theory and Spatial Interaction Models ===
{{Details|Spatial Interaction Models}}
It was once thought that central place theory is not compatible with spatial interaction models (SIM). It is paradoxical however that some times towns or shopping centres are planned with CPT, and subsequently evaluated with SIM.

Openshaw and Veneris (2003) succeeded in linking these two major regional theories in a clear and theoretically consistent way: using the data they derived from the operationalization of CPT, they experimented with several SIM. Following a thorough investigation via computer simulation, they reached important theoretical and practical conclusions.

Smith was able to delineate medical care regions (the range), describe the hierarchy of medical services, the population base required of each medical specialty (threshold), the efficiency of regions, and the importance of how an area was settled to the delivery of medical care, that is, according to traffic, market or administrative principles. What is central place?

'''Christoph Cremer''' (born in [[Freiburg]] im Breisgau, [[Germany]]) is a German [[physicist]] and [[professor]] at the [[Ruprecht-Karls-University Heidelberg]], honorary professor at the [[University of Mainz]]&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.imb-mainz.de/fileadmin/imb/news/Press_Release_Cremer_HonProfJGU.pdf] Honorary Professorship for IMB’s Christoph Cremer&lt;/ref&gt; and group leader at the [[Institute of Molecular Biology]] (IMB) a newly established research centre on the campus of the Johannes Gutenberg University of [[Mainz]], [[Germany]], who has successfully overcome the conventional limit of resolution that applies to light based investigations (the [[Abbe limit]]) by a range of different methods (1971/1978 development of the concept of 4Pi-microscopy; 1996 localization [[microscopy]] SPDM; 1997 spatially structured illumination SMI). In September 2014 he founded the NPO LuciaOptics to support the use of [[Super-resolution microscopy]] in the fields of [[molecular biology]], [[biomedicine]], [[microbiology]], [[virology]], [[pharmaceutical sciences]] and [[diagnosis]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.luciaoptics.org] Research Center Microscopy LuciaOptics&lt;/ref&gt;

His actual microscope Vertico-SMI is the world’s fastest nano light microscope that allows large scale investigation of supramolecular complexes including living cell conditions. It allows 3 D imaging of biological preparations marked with conventional fluorescent dyes and reaches a resolution of 10&amp;nbsp;nm in 2D and 40&amp;nbsp;nm in 3D.

This nanoscope has therefore the potential to add substantially to the current revolution in optical imaging which will affect the entire molecular biology, medical and pharmaceutical research. The technology allows the development of new strategies for the prevention, the lowering of risk and therapeutic treatment of diseases.

== Biography ==
Following a few semesters studying [[philosophy]] and [[history]] at [[Freiburg University]] and [[Munich University]], Cremer studied [[physics]] in [[Munich]] (with financial support from the [[Studienstiftung des Deutschen Volkes]]) and completed his [[Ph.D.]] in [[genetics]] and [[biophysics]] in Freiburg. This was followed by post-doctoral studies at the Institute for Human Genetics at Freiburg University, several years in the United States at the [[University of California]], and his "[[Habilitation]]" in general human genetics and experimental cytogenetics at Freiburg University. Since 1983, he is teaching as a professor (chair since 2004) for "applied optics and information processing" at the Kirchhoff Institute for Physics at the University of Heidelberg. In addition, he is a member of the [[Interdisciplinary Center for Scientific Computing]] of the Institute for Pharmacy and Molecular Biotechnology, as well as of the University’s "Bioquant" Center. Cremer is a participant in three current "Projects of Excellence" of the University of Heidelberg (2007–2012), and is also a partner in the Biotechnology Cluster for cell-based and molecular medicine, one of five clusters selected in 2008 as German [[BMBF]] Clusters of Excellence. Elected as Second Speaker of the Senate of the University of Heidelberg (since 2006), Cremer is also involved in university governance and politics. In his function as adjunct professor at the [[University of Maine]] and as member of the [[Jackson Laboratory]] ([[Bar Harbor, Maine]]), where he undertakes research for several weeks each year during the semester breaks, he is involved in the establishment of the biophysics center (Institute for Molecular Biophysics), which is linked with the University of Heidelberg through a "Global Network" collaboration.

Cremer is married to [[architect]] and artist Letizia Mancino-Cremer.

== Fundamental developments ==

=== Developing the concept of 4Pi microscopy ===
Cremer was involved early in the further development of [[laser]] based [[light microscopy]] approaches. First ideas had their origin in his graduate student years in the 1970s. Jointly with his brother [[Thomas Cremer]], now professor (chair) of Anthropology and Human Genetics at the Ludwigs-Maximilian University in Munich, Christoph Cremer proposed the development of a [[hologram]]-based laser scanning 4Pi [[microscope]]. The basic idea was to focus laser light from all sides (space angle 4Pi) in a spot with a diameter smaller than the conventional laser focus and to scan the object by means of this spot. In this manner, it should be possible to achieve an improved [[optical resolution]] beyond the conventional limit of approx. 200&amp;nbsp;nm lateral, 600&amp;nbsp;nm axial.&lt;ref name="CremerCremer1978"&gt;C. Cremer and T. Cremer (1978): Considerations on a laser-scanning-microscope with high resolution and depth of field ''Microscopica Acta'' VOL. 81 NUMBER 1 September, pp. 31—44 (1978)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;T.

In ''European Journal of Histochemistry'', Vol. 50, pp. 223-272&lt;/ref&gt; Since 1992, 4Pi microscopy has been developed by [[Stefan Hell]] (Max-Planck Institute for Biophysical Chemistry, Göttingen) into a highly efficient, high-resolution imaging process, using two microscope [[objective lenses]] of high numeric aperture opposing each other.&lt;ref&gt;S. Hell, S. Lindek, C. Cremer, E. H. K. Stelzer (1994): Measurement of the 4pi-confocal point spread function proves 75 nm axial resolution: in ''Applied Physics Letters'' Vol 64, pp. 1335-1337&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;P. E. Hänninen, S. W.

Cremer(1995): Two-photon excitation 4Pi confocal microscope - Enhanced axial resolution microscope for biological research: , in ''Applied Physics Letters'', Vol 68, pp. 1698-1700&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Development of the first DNA laser-UV-microirradiation technique for living cells ===
In the early 1970s, the brothers realized a [[Ultraviolet|UV]] laser micro irradiation instrument which for the first time made it possible to irradiate in a controlled manner only a tiny part of a [[living cell]] at the absorption maximum for [[DNA]] (257&amp;nbsp;nm).&lt;ref&gt;C. Cremer, C. Zorn und T. Cremer (1974): An ultraviolet Laser microbeam for 257 nm/Eine Laser-UV-Mikrobestrahlungsapparatur für 257 nm: in ''Microscopica Acta'' Vol. 75, No. 4, pp. 331—337&lt;/ref&gt; This replaced the conventional UV partial irradiation practiced for over 60 years. In this way, it was possible for the first time to induce alterations in the DNA in a focused manner (i.e. at predetermined places in the [[cell nucleus]] of living cells) without compromising the cells ability to divide and to survive. Specific very small cell regions could be irradiated and thus the dynamics of [[macromolecules]] (DNA) contained there quantitatively estimated. Furthermore, due to the high speed of the process using irradiation times of fractions of a second, it became possible to irradiate even moving [[cell organelles]]. This development provided the basis for important experiments in the area of [[genome]] structure research (establishing the existence of so-called [[chromosome territories]] in living [[mammalian]] cells) and led, a few years later (1979/1980) to a successful collaboration with the biologist [[Christiane Nüsslein-Volhard]] ([[Max Planck Institute for Developmental Biology]], [[Tübingen]]). In this collaboration Cremer used his UV laser micro irradiation equipment to elicit cellular changes in the early [[larval]] stages of the fruit fly ''[[Drosophila melanogaster]]''.&lt;ref&gt;M.

Nüsslein-Volhard (1979): A Fate Map for the Larval Epidermis of Drosophila melanogaster: Localized Cuticle Defects Following Irradiation of the Blastoderm with an Ultraviolet Laser Microbeam: in ''Developmental Biology'' 73, pp. 239-255&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;C.

Cremer(1980): A dorso-ventral shift of embryonic primordia in a new maternal-effect mutant of Drosophila: in ''Nature'' (London), Vol. 283, No. 5746, pp. 474-476&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Development of the confocal laser scanning microscopy for fluorescence ===
On the basis of experience gained in the construction and application of the UV laser micro irradiation instrument, the Cremer brothers designed in 1978 a laser scanning process which scans point-by-point the three-dimensional surface of an object by means of a focused laser beam and creates the over-all picture by electronic means similar to those used in scanning electron microscopes.&lt;ref name="CremerCremer1978"/&gt; It is this plan for the construction of a [[confocal laser scanning microscope]] (CSLM), which for the first time combined the laser scanning method with the 3D detection of biological objects labeled with [[fluorescent marker]]s that earned Cremer his professorial position at the University of Heidelberg. During the next decade, the confocal fluorescence microscopy was developed into a technically fully matured state in particular by groups working at the [[University of Amsterdam]] and the [[European Molecular Biology Laboratory]] (EMBL) in Heidelberg and their industry partners. In later years, this technology was adopted widely by biomolecular and [[biomedical]] laboratories and remains to this day the gold standard as far as three-dimensional light microscopy with conventional resolution is concerned.

=== Development of the super resolution microscopy methods ===

The goal of microscopy is in many cases to determine the size of individual, small objects. Conventional fluorescence microscopy can only establish sizes to around the conventional [[optical resolution]] limit of approximately 200&amp;nbsp;nm (lateral). More than 20 years after submitting the 4 pi patent application,&lt;ref name="CremerCremer1978"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Cremer C, Cremer T (1971) &lt;math&gt;4\pi&lt;/math&gt; Punkthologramme: Physikalische Grundlagen und mögliche Anwendungen.

With the [[Vertico SMI]] microscope he could realize his various super resolution techniques including SMI,SPDM, SPDMphymod and LIMON. These methods are mainly used for biomedical applications &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.luciaoptics.com/press-publications/papers-biomedical-applications/ Biomedical applications for Super Resolution Microscopy]&lt;/ref&gt;

====Spatially Modulated Illumination SMI====
Around 1995, he commenced with the development of a light microscopic process, which achieved a substantially improved size resolution of cellular [[nanostructure]]s stained with a fluorescent marker. This time he employed the principle of wide field microscopy combined with structured laser illumination (spatially modulated illumination, SMI)&lt;ref&gt;R. Heintzmann, C. Cremer (1999) Lateral modulated excitation microscopy: ''Improvement of resolution by using a diffraction grating''. Proc. SPIE 3568: 185-196&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;US patent 7,342,717, filed 10 July 1997: Christoph Cremer, Michael Hausmann, Joachim Bradl, Bernhard Schneider ''Wave field microscope with detection point spread function''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="BaddeleyCremerBirk2007"&gt;D.

In addition, this technology is no longer subjected to the speed limitations of the focusing microscopy so that it becomes possible to undertake 3D analyses of whole cells within short observation times (at the moment around a few seconds).

==== Localization Microscopy SPDM ====
Also around 1995, Cremer developed and realized new fluorescence based wide field microscopy approaches which had as their goal the improvement of the effective optical resolution (in terms of the smallest detectable distance between two localized objects) down to a fraction of the conventional resolution (spectral precision distance/position determination microscopy, SPDM; Disambiguation SPDM: S = Spectral, P = Precision, D = Distance, M = Microscopy).&lt;ref&gt;J.

==== Localization Microscopy SPDMphymod ====
With this method, it is possible to use conventional, well established and inexpensive fluorescent dyes, standard like GFP, RFP, YFP, Alexa 488, Alexa 568, Alexa 647, Cy2, Cy3, Atto 488 and fluorescein.

==== 3D Light microscopical nanosizing (LIMON) microscopy ====
Combining SPDM and SMI, known as LIMON microscopy.&lt;ref name="ReymannCremerMay2008"/&gt; Christoph Cremer can currently achieve a resolution of approx. 10&amp;nbsp;nm in 2D and 40&amp;nbsp;nm in 3D in wide field images of whole living cells.&lt;ref&gt;P.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5569">The '''Department of Political Science''' of [[Soochow University (Taiwan)|Soochow University]] is one of the oldest departement of the university. This departement exists since 1954, when Soochow University was reestablished in [[Taiwan]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.scu.edu.tw/artsoc/english2/politics.html&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The Department of Political Science of [[Soochow University (Taiwan)|Soochow University has over 50&amp;nbsp;years of history]], being one of the four departments that existed during the reestablishment of the university in Taiwan in 1954.&lt;ref&gt;http://www2.scu.edu.tw/politics/default.asp?Subject=eProfile&lt;/ref&gt; The Master program of the department was established in 1991; followed by the Doctoral program in 1998.&lt;ref&gt;http://www2.scu.edu.tw/politics/default.asp?Subject=eGraduate&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Soochow University (Taiwan)|2003]], in a very rigorous review held by Soochow University, the Department of Political Science was evaluated excellent among the inspectors from the Evaluation and Review Committee of academic fields. The department is also awarded with financial support to help to fund many teaching and research activities and projects with unique features.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.scu.edu.tw/artsoc/english2/politics.html http://myweb.scu.edu.tw/~ctl/eng-old/page-1-1.htm&lt;/ref&gt;
The Department has also been funded by the [[Ministry of Education (Taiwan)|Ministry of Education]] under the [http://www.studyintaiwan.org/teaching_excellence.html Teaching Excellence Projects].&lt;ref&gt;http://myweb.scu.edu.tw/~ctl/eng-old/page-1-1.htm&lt;/ref&gt; Since 2009, Shiow-Duan Hawang is the director of the department.&lt;ref&gt;http://www2.scu.edu.tw/politics/default.asp?Subject=eTeacher&lt;/ref&gt;

==Programs and goals==
The teaching program is characterized by a multidisciplinary approach of [[history of political thought]], [[Comparative Government and Politics]], [[international relations]] and [[public administration]].&lt;ref&gt;http://myweb.scu.edu.tw/~ctl/eng-old/page-1-1.htm&lt;/ref&gt;
The international exchanges and various academic activities and lectures for teachers and students play an important role in this department.&lt;ref&gt;http://www2.scu.edu.tw/politics/default.asp?Subject=eTeacher.&lt;/ref&gt;

The teaching programs of the department are particularly oriented on [[Status of Taiwan|international issues]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www2.scu.edu.tw/politics/default.asp?Subject=eProfile&lt;/ref&gt;
In addition to basic trainings in political science, the departement offers diversified curriculum and programs open to international students.&lt;ref&gt;http://www2.scu.edu.tw/politics/default.asp?Subject=eProfile&lt;/ref&gt;

==Scientific Research==

From [[Quarterly|1999]] to [[Quarterly|2008]], teachers of the Department have conducted 90 research projects granted by the government and its [[National Science Council]].&lt;ref&gt;http://myweb.scu.edu.tw/~ctl/eng-old/page-1-1.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

Since 2000,&lt;ref&gt;http://www2.scu.edu.tw/politics/default.asp?Subject=eProfile&lt;/ref&gt; the Department of Political Science has been organized the Research Center, the Center for [[Globalization|Globalization Studies]], the Center for [[Globalization|E.U]] Studies, the Centre for Parliamentary Research, the Center for [[U.N]], Studies and the Metropolitan Governance Study Center and the Workshop of [[Human Rights]] and [[Democracy]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www2.scu.edu.tw/politics/default.asp?Subject=eProfile&lt;/ref&gt;

==[[Quarterly|Soochow Journal of Political Science]]==

With its first issue released in 1991,&lt;ref&gt;http://www2.scu.edu.tw/politics/default.asp?Subject=eJournal.&lt;/ref&gt; the Soochow Journal of Political Science has continued to develop its reputation. Since the journal changed to a [[Quarterly|quarterly publication]] in September 2004, the Soochow Journal of Political Science has been included in the TSSCI ([[Taiwan Social Science Citation Index]]).&lt;ref&gt;http://db1n.sinica.edu.tw/textdb/tssci/searchindexe.php&lt;/ref&gt;

The contributions published in the journal come from a wide range of research related to the most diverse areas.&lt;ref&gt;http://www2.scu.edu.tw/politics/journal/ejournalrul.asp.&lt;/ref&gt;
Many professors, researchers, teachers or researchers in political science from [[Soochow University (Taipei)|Soochow University]], as elsewhere, had contributed to the writing of this journal.&lt;ref&gt;http://www2.scu.edu.tw/politics/default.asp?Subject=eProfile&lt;/ref&gt;

==Faculty==
The departement includes scholars such as Shiow-Duan Hawang, Bih-Rong Liu, Wen-Cheng Wu, Hao-Yu Wang, Ya-Tang Hsu, Chen-Yu Hsieh, Chen-Kuo Hsu, Mab Huang, Chih-Cheng Lo, Li-Khan Chen, Huei-Huang Wang, Shu-Pin Liu, Hsiu-Chuan Tsai, Jui-Chi Chen, Chun-Hung Chen, Chih-Chung Wu, Yung-Ming Hsu, Chiung-Chu Lin, Yun-Chu Tsai, Yueh-Chu Lin and Ju-Dar Shen.&lt;ref&gt;http://www2.scu.edu.tw/politics/default.asp?Subject=eTeacher&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Eco''RI''' (pronounced "eco R one") is a restriction [[endonuclease]] enzyme isolated from species ''[[E. coli]].'' The ''Eco'' part of the enzyme's name originates from the species from which it was isolated, while the R represents the particular strain, in this case RY13. The last part of its name, the I, denotes that it was the first enzyme isolated from this strain. ''Eco''RI is a restriction enzyme that cleaves DNA double helices into fragments at specific sites. It is also a part of the [[restriction modification system]].

In [[molecular biology]] it is used as a [[restriction enzyme]]. ''Eco''RI creates 4 nucleotide [[DNA end|sticky ends]] with [[5' end]] overhangs of AATT. The nucleic acid recognition sequence where the enzyme cuts is G/AATTC, which has a [[Palindrome|palindromic]], complementary sequence of CTTAA/G. The / in the sequence indicates which phosphodiester bond the enzyme will break in the DNA molecule. Other restriction enzymes, depending on their cut sites, can also leave 3' overhangs or blunt ends with no overhangs.

== Structure ==

=== Primary structure ===
''Eco''RI contains the PD..D/EXK motif within its active site like many [[Restriction enzyme|restriction endonucleases]].

=== Tertiary and quaternary structure ===
The enzyme is a [[homodimer]] of a 31 kilodalton subunit consisting of one globular domain of the α/β architecture. Each subunit contains a loop which sticks out from the globular domain and wraps around the DNA when bound.&lt;ref name="Pingoud"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Pingoud A, Jeltsch A | title = Structure and function of type II restriction endonucleases | journal = Nucleic Acids Research | volume = 29 | issue = 18 | pages = 3705–27 | date = September 2001 | pmid = 11557805 | pmc = 55916 | doi = 10.1093/nar/29.18.3705 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Kurpiewski"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Kurpiewski MR, Engler LE, Wozniak LA, Kobylanska A, Koziolkiewicz M, Stec WJ, Jen-Jacobson L | title = Mechanisms of coupling between DNA recognition specificity and catalysis in EcoRI endonuclease | journal = Structure | volume = 12 | issue = 10 | pages = 1775–88 | date = October 2004 | pmid = 15458627 | doi = 10.1016/j.str.2004.07.016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:EcoRI_restriction_enzyme_recognition_site.svg|thumb|175x175px|''Ec''oRI recognition site with cutting pattern indicated by a green line]]

''Eco''RI has been cocrystallized with the sequence it normally cuts. This crystal was used to solve the structure of the complex {{PDB2|1QPS}}. The solved crystal structure shows that the subunits of the enzyme [[homodimer]] interact with the DNA symmetrically.&lt;ref name="Pingoud" /&gt; In the complex, two [[Alpha helix|α-helices]] from each subunit come together to form a four-helix bundle.&lt;ref name="Bitinaite"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Bitinaite J, Wah DA, Aggarwal AK, Schildkraut I | title = FokI dimerization is required for DNA cleavage | journal = Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America | volume = 95 | issue = 18 | pages = 10570–5 | date = September 1998 | pmid = 9724744 | pmc = 27935 | doi = 10.1073/pnas.95.18.10570 }}&lt;/ref&gt; On the interacting helices are residues Glu144 and Arg145, which interact together, forming a crosstalk ring that is believed to allow the enzyme's two active sites to communicate.&lt;ref name="Kim"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Kim YC, Grable JC, Love R, Greene PJ, Rosenberg JM | title = Refinement of Eco RI endonuclease crystal structure: a revised protein chain tracing | journal = Science | volume = 249 | issue = 4974 | pages = 1307–9 | date = September 1990 | pmid = 2399465 | doi = 10.1126/science.2399465 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Uses ==

Restriction enzymes, such as ''Eco''RI, are used in a wide variety of molecular genetics techniques including [[Clone (genetics)|cloning]], DNA screening and deleting sections of DNA ''in vitro''. Restriction enzymes, like ''Eco''RI, that generate [[Sticky and blunt ends|sticky ends]] of DNA are often used to cut DNA prior to [[DNA ligase|ligation]], as the sticky ends make the [[DNA ligase|ligation reaction]] more efficient. ''Eco''RI can exhibit non-site-specific cutting, known as [[star activity]], depending on the conditions present in the reaction. Conditions that can induce star activity when using ''Eco''RI include low salt concentration, high glycerol concentration, excessive amounts of enzyme present in the reaction, high pH and contamination with certain organic solvents. The cut made by the Eco RI enzyme produces sticky ends on the vector mainly plasmids or viral DNA's. &lt;ref&gt;http://www.neb.com/nebecomm/products/faqproductR0101.asp#1&lt;/ref&gt;

|thumb]]'''Eutelic''' organisms have a fixed number of [[somatic cell]]s when they reach maturity, the exact number being constant for any one [[species]]. Development proceeds by cell division until maturity; further growth occurs via [[hypertrophy|cell enlargement]] only. In nematodes the number of nuclei is also constant; there is growth in size of the body but this is due to the growth in the size of the cells ([[hypertrophy]]).

Most eutelic organisms are microscopic.

It is named after [[Robert Floyd]]. It is defined by filling the rows of the triangle with consecutive numbers, starting with a 1 in the top left corner:

'''Frame semantics''' is a theory of [[Linguistics|linguistic]] [[Meaning (linguistics)|meaning]] developed by [[Charles J. Fillmore]] that extends his earlier [[case grammar]]. It relates [[natural language|linguistic]] [[semantics]] to encyclopedic knowledge.
The basic idea is that one cannot understand the meaning of a single word without access to all the essential knowledge that relates to that word. For example, one would not be able to understand the word "sell" without knowing anything about the situation of commercial transfer, which also involves, among other things, a seller, a buyer, goods, money, the relation between the money and the goods, the relations between the seller and the goods and the money, the relation between the buyer and the goods and the money and so on.

Thus, a word activates, or evokes, a frame of semantic knowledge relating to the specific concept to which it refers (or highlights, in frame semantic terminology).

A '''semantic frame''' is a collection of facts that specify "characteristic features, attributes, and functions of a denotatum, and its characteristic interactions with things necessarily or typically associated with it." &lt;ref&gt;Keith Alan (2001, p. 251), Natural Language Semantics, Blackwell Publishers Ltd, Oxford, {{ISBN|0-631-19296-4}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
A semantic frame can also be defined as a [[Coherentism|coherent structure]] of related concepts that are related such that without knowledge of all of them, one does not have complete knowledge of any one; they are in that sense types of [[Gestalt psychology|gestalt]]&lt;ref&gt; needed &lt;/ref&gt;. Frames are based on recurring experiences. So the commercial transaction frame is based on recurring experiences of commercial transactions.

Words not only highlight individual concepts, but also specify a certain perspective from which the frame is viewed. For example "sell" views the situation from the perspective of the seller and "buy" from the perspective of the buyer. This, according to Fillmore, explains the observed asymmetries in many [[lexical semantics|lexical relations]].

While originally only being applied to [[lexeme]]s, frame semantics has now been expanded to [[grammatical construction]]s and other larger and more complex linguistic units and has more or less been integrated into [[construction grammar]] as the main semantic principle. Semantic frames are also becoming used in [[information model]]ing, for example in [[Gellish]], especially in the form of 'definition models' and 'knowledge models'.

Frame semantics has much in common with the semantic principle of profiling from [[Ronald Langacker|Ronald W. Langacker]]'s [[Cognitive Grammar]].&lt;ref&gt;Alan Cruse (2004, p. 137f.), Meaning in Language. An Introduction to Semantics and Pragmatics. Second Edition, Oxford University Press, New York, {{ISBN|978-0-19-926306-6}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

There are three operations:  [[Fuzzy set operations#Fuzzy complements|fuzzy complement]]s, [[Fuzzy set operations#Fuzzy intersections|fuzzy intersection]]s, and [[Fuzzy set operations#Fuzzy unions|fuzzy union]]s.

==Standard fuzzy set operations==
Let A and B be fuzzy sets that A,B ⊆ U, u is any element (e.g. value) in the U universe: u ∈ U.

;Standard complement
:&lt;math&gt;\mu_{\lnot{A}}(u) = 1 - \mu_A(u)&lt;/math&gt;
The complement is sometimes denoted by '''∁'''A or A&lt;sup&gt;'''∁'''&lt;/sup&gt; instead of '''¬'''A.

;Standard intersection
:&lt;math&gt;\mu_{A \cap B}(u) = \min\{\mu_A(u), \mu_B(u)\}&lt;/math&gt;

;Standard union
:&lt;math&gt;\mu_{A \cup B}(u) = \max\{\mu_A(u), \mu_B(u)\}&lt;/math&gt;

In general, the triple (i,u,n) is called '''[[t-norm#Non-standard negators|De Morgan Triplet]]''' [[iff]]
* i is a [[t-norm#Definition|t-norm]],
* u is a [[t-norm#T-conorms|t-conorm]] (aka s-norm),
* n is a [[t-norm#Non-standard negators|strong negator]],
so that for all ''x'',''y'' ∈ [0, 1] the following holds true: 
:''u''(''x'',''y'') = ''n''(''i''(''n''(''x''), ''n''(''y'')) 
(generalized De Morgan relation).&lt;ref&gt;Ismat Beg, Samina Ashraf: [https://www.researchgate.net/publication/228744370_Similarity_measures_for_fuzzy_sets Similarity measures for fuzzy sets], at: Applied and Computational Mathematics, March 2009, available on Research Gate since November 23rd, 2016&lt;/ref&gt; This implies the axioms provided below in detail.

==Fuzzy complements==
''μ&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt;''(''x'') is defined as the degree to which ''x'' belongs to ''A''. Let ''∁A'' denote a fuzzy complement of ''A'' of type ''c''. Then ''μ&lt;sub&gt;∁A&lt;/sub&gt;''(''x'') is the degree to which ''x'' belongs to ''∁A'', and the degree to which ''x'' does not belong to ''A''. (''μ&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt;''(''x'') is therefore the degree to which ''x'' does not belong to ''∁A''.) Let a complement '''''∁'''A'' be defined by a function

:''c'' : [0,1] → [0,1]

:For all ''x'' ∈ ''U'':  ''μ&lt;sub&gt;∁A&lt;/sub&gt;''(''x'') = ''c''(''μ&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt;''(''x''))

===Axioms for fuzzy complements===
;Axiom c1. ''Boundary condition''
:''c''(0) = 1 and ''c''(1) = 0

;Axiom c2. ''Monotonicity''
:For all ''a'', ''b'' ∈ [0, 1], if ''a'' &lt; ''b'', then ''c''(''a'') &gt; ''c''(''b'')

;Axiom c3. ''Continuity''
:''c'' is continuous function.

;Axiom c4. ''Involutions'' 
:''c'' is an [[Involution (mathematics)|involution]], which means that ''c''(''c''(''a'')) = ''a'' for each ''a'' ∈ [0,1]
''c'' is a ''strong [[T-norm#Non-standard negators|negator]]'' (aka ''fuzzy complement'').

A function c satisfying axioms c1 and c2 has at least one fixpoint a&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt; with c(a&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt;) = a&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt;,
and if axiom c3 is fulfilled as well there is exactly one such fixpoint. For the standard negator c(x) = 1-x the unique fixpoint is a&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt; = 0.5 .&lt;ref name="GR2009-2010"&gt;Günther Rudolph: [https://ls11-www.cs.tu-dortmund.de/people/rudolph/teaching/lectures/CI/WS2009-10/lec06.pps Computational Intelligence (PPS)], TU Dortmund, Algorithm Engineering LS11, Winter Term 2009/10. Note that this power point sheet may have some problems with special character rendering&lt;/ref&gt;

==Fuzzy intersections==
{{main|T-norm}}
The intersection of two fuzzy sets ''A'' and ''B'' is specified in general by a binary operation on the unit interval, a function of the form      
  
:''i'':[0,1]×[0,1] → [0,1].

:For all ''x'' ∈ ''U'':  ''μ''&lt;sub&gt;''A'' ∩ ''B''&lt;/sub&gt;(''x'') = ''i''[''μ&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt;''(''x''), ''μ&lt;sub&gt;B&lt;/sub&gt;''(''x'')].

===Axioms for fuzzy intersection===
;Axiom i1. ''Boundary condition''
:''i''(''a'', 1) = ''a''

;Axiom i2. ''Monotonicity''
:''b'' ≤ ''d'' implies ''i''(''a'', ''b'') ≤ ''i''(''a'', ''d'')

;Axiom i3. ''Commutativity''
:''i''(''a'', ''b'') = ''i''(''b'', ''a'')

;Axiom i4. ''Associativity''
:''i''(''a'', ''i''(''b'', ''d'')) = ''i''(''i''(''a'', ''b''), ''d'')

;Axiom i5. ''Continuity''
:''i'' is a continuous function

;Axiom i6. ''Subidempotency''
:''i''(''a'', ''a'') ≤ ''a''

;Axiom i7. ''Strict monotonicity''
:''i'' (''a''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''b''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;) ≤ ''i'' (''a''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, ''b''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) if ''a''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; ≤ ''a''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and  ''b''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; ≤ ''b''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;

Axioms i1 up to i4 define a '''t-norm''' (aka '''fuzzy intersection'''). The standard t-norm min is the only idempotent t-norm (that is, ''i'' (''a''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''a''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;) = ''a'' for all ''a'' ∈ [0,1]).&lt;ref name="GR2009-2010" /&gt;

FUZZY UNION
The union of two fuzzy sets ''A'' and ''B'' is specified in general by a binary operation on the unit interval function of the form

:''u'':[0,1]×[0,1] → [0,1].

:For all ''x'' ∈ ''U'':  ''μ''&lt;sub&gt;''A'' ∪ ''B''&lt;/sub&gt;(''x'') = ''u''[''μ&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt;''(''x''), ''μ&lt;sub&gt;B&lt;/sub&gt;''(''x'')].

===Axioms for fuzzy union===
;Axiom u1.  ''Boundary condition''
:''u''(''a'', 0) =''u''(0 ,''a'') = ''a''

;Axiom u2. ''Monotonicity''
:''b'' ≤ ''d'' implies ''u''(''a'', ''b'') ≤ ''u''(''a'', ''d'')

;Axiom u3. ''Commutativity''
:''u''(''a'', ''b'') = ''u''(''b'', ''a'')

;Axiom u4. ''Associativity''
:''u''(''a'', ''u''(''b'', ''d'')) = ''u''(''u''(''a, ''b''), ''d'')

;Axiom u5. ''Continuity''
:''u'' is a continuous function

;Axiom u6. ''Superidempotency''
:''u''(''a'', ''a'') ≥ ''a''

;Axiom u7. ''Strict monotonicity''
:''a''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; &lt; ''a''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and ''b''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; &lt; ''b''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;  implies ''u''(''a''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''b''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;) &lt; ''u''(''a''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, ''b''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)

Axioms u1 up to u4 define a '''t-conorm''' (aka '''s-norm''' or '''fuzzy intersection'''). The standard t-conorm max is the only idempotent t-conorm (i. e. u (a1, a1) = a for all a ∈ [0,1]).&lt;ref name="GR2009-2010" /&gt;

==Aggregation operations==
Aggregation operations on fuzzy sets are operations by which several fuzzy sets are combined in a desirable way to produce a single fuzzy set.

Aggregation operation on ''n'' fuzzy set (2 ≤ ''n'') is defined by a function

:''h'':[0,1]&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt; → [0,1]

===Axioms for aggregation operations fuzzy sets===
;Axiom h1. ''Boundary condition''
:''h''(0, 0, ..., 0) = 0  and  ''h''(1, 1, ..., 1) = one

;Axiom h2. ''Monotonicity''
:For any pair &lt;''a''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''a''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, ..., ''a''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;&gt; and &lt;''b''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''b''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, ..., ''b''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;&gt; of ''n''-tuples such that ''a''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;, ''b''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; ∈ [0,1] for all ''i'' ∈ ''N''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;, if ''a''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; ≤ ''b''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; for all ''i'' ∈ ''N''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;, then ''h''(''a''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''a''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, ...,''a''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;) ≤ ''h''(''b''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''b''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, ..., ''b''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;); that is, ''h'' is monotonic increasing in all its arguments.

;Axiom h3. ''Continuity''
:''h'' is a continuous function.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6200">'''Human milk oligosaccharides''' (HMO, also known as human milk glycans) are sugar molecules, that are part of the oligosaccharides group and which can be found in high concentrations exclusively in [[Breast milk|human breast milk]]. &lt;ref name=":0"&gt;L. Bode: ''Human milk oligosaccharides: every baby needs a sugar mama.'' In: ''Glycobiology.''

==Occurrence==
Human milk oligosaccharides form the third most abundant solid component ([[Solution|dissolved]] or [[Emulsion|emulsified]] or [[Suspension (chemistry)|suspended]] in water) of human milk after [[lactose]] and [[fat]].&lt;ref&gt;X. Chen: ''Human Milk Oligosaccharides (HMOS): Structure, Function, and Enzyme-Catalyzed Synthesis.'' In: ''Advances in carbohydrate chemistry and biochemistry.'' Band 72, 2015, S.&amp;nbsp;113–190, {{DOI|10.1016/bs.accb.2015.08.002}}, {{PMID|26613816}}.&lt;/ref&gt; HMOs are present in a concentration of 0.35 - 0.88 oz / L. Approximately 200 structurally different human milk oligosaccharides are known. The composition of human milk oligosaccharides in breast milk is individual to each mother and varies over the [[Breastfeeding|period of lactation]]. The dominant oligosaccharide in 80% of all women is [[2'-Fucosyllactose|2'-fucosyllactose]], which is present in human breast milk at a concentration of approximately 0.088 oz/ L.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{citation/core|Surname1=Katja Parschat, Bettina Gutiérrez|Periodical=[[dei – die ernährungsindustrie]]|Title=Fermentativ erzeugte humane Milch-Oligosaccharide wirken präbiotisch.|At=p.&amp;nbsp;38|Date=2016-11|language=German
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Characteristics==
In contrast to the other components of breast milk that are absorbed by the infant through breastfeeding, HMOs are [[Digestion|indigestible]] for the newborn child. However, they have a [[Prebiotic (nutrition)|prebiotic]] effect and serve as food for intestinal bacteria, especially [[Bifidobacterium|bifidobacteria]].&lt;ref&gt;K. Le Doare, B. Holder, A. Bassett, P. S. Pannaraj: ''Mother's Milk: A Purposeful Contribution to the Development of the Infant Microbiota and Immunity.'' In: ''Frontiers in immunology.'' Band 9, 2018, S.&amp;nbsp;361, {{DOI|10.3389/fimmu.2018.00361}}, {{PMID|29599768}}, {{PMC|5863526}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&amp;nbsp;The dominance of these intestinal bacteria in the gut reduces the colonization with [[Pathogen#Pathogenicity|pathogenic]] [[bacteria]] (probiosis) and thereby ensures a healthy [[Gut flora#Intestinal flora|intestinal flora]] (intestinal microbiome) and a reduced risk of dangerous intestinal infections.

Recent studies also suggest that HMOs significantly lower the risk of viral and bacterial [[Infection|infections]] and thus diminish the chance to get diarrhoea and respiratory diseases.

This protective function of the HMOs is activated when in contact with specific [[Pathogen|pathogens]], such as certain bacteria or [[Virus|viruses]]. These have the ability to bind themselves to the glycan [[Receptor (biochemistry)|receptors]] (receptors for long chains of connected sugar molecules on the surface of human cells) located on the surface of the intestinal cells and can thereby infect the cells of the [[Intestinal epithelium|intestinal mucosa]]. Researchers have discovered that HMOs mimic these glycan receptors so the pathogens bind themselves to the HMOs rather than the intestinal cells. This reduces the risk of an infection with a pathogen.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;
In addition to this, HMOs seem to influence the reaction of specific cells of the [[immune system]] in a way that reduces [[Inflammation|inflammatory]] responses.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;D. S. Newburg, Y. He: ''Neonatal Gut Microbiota and Human Milk Glycans Cooperate to Attenuate Infection and Inflammation.'' In: ''Clinical obstetrics and gynecology.'' Band 58, Nummer 4, Dezember 2015, S.&amp;nbsp;814–826, {{DOI|10.1097/GRF.0000000000000156}}, {{PMID|26457857}}.&lt;/ref&gt; It is also suspected that HMOs reduce the risk of [[Preterm birth|premature infants]] becoming infected with the potentially life-threatening disease [[necrotizing enterocolitis]] (NEC).&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Some of the [[Metabolite|metabolites]] directly affect the [[nervous system]] or the [[brain]] and can sometimes influence the development and behavior of children in the long term. There are studies that indicate certain HMOs supply the child with [[sialic acid]] residues. Sialic acid is an [[Nutrient#Essential nutrients|essential nutrient]] for the development of the child’s brain and mental abilities.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

HMOs are used as supplements in [[baby food]] to ensure a provision of babies that are not being breastfed with this important component of the human milk.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation/core|Surname1=Ralph Ammann|Periodical=European Dairy Magazine|Title=Achieving the impossible|At=pp.&amp;nbsp;30 f.|Date=2017-05|language=German
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Evolution==
In experiments designed to test the suitability of HMOs as a prebiotic source of carbon for intestinal bacteria it was discovered that they are highly selective for a commensal bacteria known as ''[[Bifidobacterium longum|Bifidobacteria longum biovar infantis]]''. The presence of genes unique to ''[[Bifidobacterium longum|B. infantis]]'', including co-regulated glycosidases, and its efficiency at using HMOs as a carbon source may imply a co-evolution of HMOs and the genetic capability of select bacteria to utilize them.&lt;ref name="HMO-EVOLUTION"&gt;{{cite journal|last=German|first=JB|last2=Lebrilla|first2=CB|last3=Mills|first3=DA|date=18 Apr 2012|title=Human milk oligosaccharides: evolution, structures and bioselectivity as substrates for intestinal bacteria|journal=Nestle Nutr Workshop Ser Pediatr Program|series=Nestlé Nutrition Workshop Series: Pediatric Program|publisher=|volume=62|issue=|pages=205–22|doi=10.1159/000146322|isbn=978-3-8055-8553-8|pmc=2861563|pmid=18626202}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Methods of '''hydrogen storage''' for subsequent use span many approaches including high pressures, cryogenics, and chemical compounds that reversibly release H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; upon heating. [[Underground hydrogen storage]] is useful to provide [[grid energy storage]] for [[intermittent energy source]]s, like [[wind power]], as well as providing fuel for transportation, particularly for ships and airplanes.

Most research into hydrogen storage is focused on storing hydrogen as a lightweight, compact [[energy carrier]] for [[Hydrogen vehicle|mobile applications]].

[[Liquid hydrogen]] or [[slush hydrogen]] may be used, as in the [[Space Shuttle]]. However liquid hydrogen requires [[cryogenic]] storage and boils around 20.268 [[Kelvin|K]] (−252.882&amp;nbsp;°C or −423.188&amp;nbsp;°F). Hence, its [[liquefaction]] imposes a large energy loss (as energy is needed to cool it down to that temperature). The tanks must also be well insulated to prevent [[Boiling point|boil off]] but adding insulation increases cost. Liquid hydrogen has less [[energy density]] ''by volume'' than [[hydrocarbon]] fuels such as [[gasoline]] by approximately a factor of four. This highlights the density problem for pure hydrogen: there is actually about 64% more hydrogen in a liter of gasoline (116&amp;nbsp;grams hydrogen) than there is in a liter of pure liquid hydrogen (71&amp;nbsp;grams hydrogen). The carbon in the gasoline also contributes to the energy of combustion.

[[Compressed hydrogen]], by comparison, is stored quite differently. Hydrogen gas has good [[Energies per unit mass|energy density by weight]], but poor energy density by volume versus hydrocarbons, hence it requires a larger tank to store. A large [[hydrogen tank]] will be heavier than the small hydrocarbon tank used to store the same amount of energy, all other factors remaining equal. Increasing gas pressure would improve the energy density by volume, making for smaller, but not lighter container tanks (see [[hydrogen tank]]). Compressed hydrogen costs 2.1% of the energy content&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20080307082839/http://www.iea.org/textbase/nppdf/free/2005/hydrogen2005.pdf Energy technology analysis]. International Energy Agency (2005) p. 70&lt;/ref&gt; to power the compressor. Higher compression without [[energy recovery]] will mean more energy lost to the compression step. Compressed hydrogen storage can exhibit very low [[permeation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference |url=http://h2storage.net/docs/pdf/29/s4/makarov.pdf |title=Modeling of dispersion following hydrogen permeation for safety engineering and risk assessment |dead-url=yes |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110723142016/http://h2storage.net/docs/pdf/29/s4/makarov.pdf |archive-date=2011-07-23 |conference=II International Conference "Hydrogen Storage Technologies" Moscow, Russia, 28–29 October 2009 |access-date=2012-01-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Compressed hydrogen ===

Compressed hydrogen is a storage form where hydrogen gas is kept under pressures to increase the storage density. Compressed hydrogen in hydrogen tanks at 350 bar (5,000 psi) and 700 bar (10,000 psi) is used for hydrogen tank systems in vehicles, based on type IV carbon-composite technology.&lt;ref name=store&gt;{{cite journal|title=Fuel cell electric vehicles and hydrogen infrastructure: status 2012|journal=Energy &amp; Environmental Science |volume=5 |issue=10 |pages=8780 |url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/233987484 |last1=Eberle |first1=Ulrich |first2=Bernd |last2=Mueller |first3=Rittmar |last3=von Helmolt |accessdate=2014-12-19 |doi=10.1039/C2EE22596D |year=2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Car manufacturers have been developing this solution, such as Honda&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://world.honda.com/FCXClarity/package/index.html |website=Honda Worldwide |title=FCX Clarity |access-date=2012-01-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; or Nissan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nissan-global.com/EN/TECHNOLOGY/INTRODUCTION/DETAILS/XTRAIL-FCV/index.html |title=X-TRAIL FCV '03 model |dead-url=yes |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100917105718/http://www.nissan-global.com/EN/TECHNOLOGY/INTRODUCTION/DETAILS/XTRAIL-FCV/index.html |archive-date=2010-09-17 |website=Nissan-global.com |access-date=2012-01-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Liquid hydrogen ===

BMW has been working on [[liquid hydrogen]] tanks for cars, producing for example the [[BMW Hydrogen 7]]. Japan have liquid hydrogen (LH2) storage at a tanker port in Kobe, and are anticipated to receive the first shipment of liquid hydrogen via LH2 carrier in 2020.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Savvides|first1=Nick|title=Japan plans to use imported liquefied hydrogen to fuel Tokyo 2020 Olympics|url=https://fairplay.ihs.com/ship-construction/article/4280251/japan-plans-to-use-imported-liquefied-hydrogen-to-fuel-tokyo-2020-olympics |website=Fairplay|publisher=IHS Markit Maritime Portal|accessdate=22 April 2018|date=2017-01-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hydrogen is liquified by reducing its temperature to -253°C, similar to liquified natural gas (LNG) which is stored at -162°C. A potential efficiency loss of 12.79% can be achieved, or 4.26kWh/kg out of 33.3kWh/kg.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Sadaghiani |first1=Mirhadi S. |title=Introducing and energy analysis of a novel cryogenic hydrogen liquefaction process configuration|journal=International Journal of Hydrogen Energy|date=2 March 2017 |volume=42 |issue=9 |doi=10.1016/j.ijhydene.2017.01.136 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Proposals and research==
Hydrogen storage technologies can be divided into physical storage, where hydrogen molecules are stored (including pure hydrogen storage via compression and liquefaction), and chemical storage, where hydrides are stored.

===Chemical storage===
Chemical storage could offer high storage performance due to the strong binding of hydrogen and the high storage densities. However, the regeneration of storage material is still an issue. A large number of chemical storage systems are under investigation, which involve [[hydrolysis]] reactions, [[hydrogenation]]/dehydrogenation reactions, [[ammonia borane]] and other [[boron hydride]]s, ammonia, and [[Aluminium hydride|alane]] etc.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = The U.S. Department of Energy's National Hydrogen Storage Project: Progress towards meeting hydrogen-powered vehicle requirements|last = Sunita|first = Satyapal|date = 2007|journal = Catalysis Today|doi = 10.1016/j.cattod.2006.09.022|pmid = |access-date =|volume=120|issue = 3–4|pages=246–256}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Storage in hydrocarbons may also be successful in overcoming the issue with low density.  For example, supercritical hydrogen at 30&amp;nbsp;°C and 500 bar only has a density of 15.0&amp;nbsp;mol/L while [[methanol]] has a density of 49.5&amp;nbsp;mol H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;/L methanol and saturated [[dimethyl ether]] at 30&amp;nbsp;°C and 7 bar has a density of 42.1&amp;nbsp;mol H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;/L dimethyl ether.  These liquids would use much smaller, cheaper, safer storage tanks.{{citation needed|date=February 2016}} The most promising chemical approach is electrochemical hydrogen storage, as the release of hydrogen can be controlled by the applied electricity.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0360319917333529|title = Electrochemical hydrogen storage: Opportunities for fuel storage, batteries, fuel cells, and supercapacitors|last1 = Eftekhari|first1 = Ali|last2 = Baizeng| first2=Fang|date = 2017|journal = International Journal of Hydrogen Energy|doi = 10.1016/j.ijhydene.2017.08.103|pmid = |access-date =|volume=42|issue = 40|pages=25143–25165}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most of the materials listed below can be directly used for electrochemical hydrogen storage.

==== Metal hydrides ====
[[Image:Metal hydride hydrogen.storage.graph.gif|thumb|upright=1.25|Metal hydride hydrogen storage]]
[[Metal hydrides]], such as [[Magnesium hydride|MgH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]], [[Sodium aluminium hydride|NaAlH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;]], [[Lithium aluminum hydride|LiAlH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;]], [[Lithium hydride|LiH]], [[LaNi5H6|LaNi&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;]], [[TiFeH2|TiFeH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]] and [[palladium hydride]], with varying degrees of efficiency, can be used as a storage medium for hydrogen, often reversibly.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www1.eere.energy.gov/hydrogenandfuelcells/storage/metal_hydrides.html DOE Metal hydrides]. eere.energy.gov (2008-12-19). Retrieved on 2012-01-08.&lt;/ref&gt; Some are easy-to-fuel liquids at ambient temperature and pressure, others are solids which could be turned into pellets. These materials have good [[energy density]], although their [[specific energy]] is often worse than the leading [[hydrocarbon]] fuels.

Most metal hydrides bind with hydrogen very strongly. As a result, high temperatures around 120&amp;nbsp;°C (248&amp;nbsp;°F) – 200&amp;nbsp;°C (392&amp;nbsp;°F) are required to release their hydrogen content. This energy cost can be reduced by using alloys which consists of a strong hydride former and a weak one such as in [[Lithium amide|LiNH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]], [[lithium borohydride|LiBH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;]] and [[sodium borohydride|NaBH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1= Christian|first1= Meganne|last2= Aguey-Zinsou|first2= Kondo François|year= 2012|title= Core–Shell Strategy Leading to High Reversible Hydrogen Storage Capacity for NaBH4|journal= [[ACS Nano]]|volume= 6|issue= 9|pages= 7739–7751|doi=10.1021/nn3030018 |pmid= 22873406}}&lt;/ref&gt; These are able to form weaker bonds, thereby requiring less input to release stored hydrogen. However, if the interaction is too weak, the pressure needed for rehydriding is high, thereby eliminating any energy savings. The target for onboard hydrogen fuel systems is roughly &lt;100&amp;nbsp;°C for release and &lt;700 bar for recharge (20–60 kJ/mol H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;).&lt;ref&gt;[http://ec.europa.eu/research/energy/pdf/efchp_hydrogen3.pdf EU Hydrogen Storage]. (PDF) . Retrieved on 2012-01-08.&lt;/ref&gt;

An alternative method for reducing dissociation temperatures is doping with activators. This has been successfully used for [[aluminium hydride]] but its complex synthesis makes it undesirable for most applications as it is not easily recharged with hydrogen.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Graetz | first1 = J. | last2 = Reilly | first2 = J. | last3 = Sandrock | first3 = G. | last4 = Johnson | first4 = J. | last5 = Zhou | first5 = W.

Currently the only hydrides which are capable of achieving the 9 wt% gravimetric goal for 2015 (see chart above) are limited to lithium, boron and aluminium based compounds; at least one of the second-row elements or Al must be added. Research is being done to determine new compounds which can be used to meet these requirements.

Proposed hydrides for use in a hydrogen economy include simple hydrides of [[magnesium hydride|magnesium]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://neel.cnrs.fr/spip.php?article1281 CNRS Institut Neel H2 Storage]. Neel.cnrs.fr. Retrieved on 2012-01-08.&lt;/ref&gt; or [[transition metal]]s and [[complex metal hydride]]s, typically containing [[sodium]], [[lithium]], or [[calcium]] and [[aluminium]] or [[boron]]. Hydrides chosen for storage applications provide low reactivity (high safety) and high hydrogen storage densities. Leading candidates are [[lithium hydride]], [[sodium borohydride]], [[lithium aluminium hydride]] and [[ammonia borane]]. A French company McPhy Energy is developing the first industrial product, based on magnesium hydride, already sold to some major clients such as Iwatani and ENEL.

''[[New Scientist]]'' reported that [[Arizona State University]] is investigating using a [[borohydride]] solution to store hydrogen, which is released when the solution flows over a catalyst made of ruthenium.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.newscientisttech.com/article/dn10066-new-type-of-hydrogen-fuel-cell-powers-up.html | title=New type of hydrogen fuel cell powers up | publisher= newscientist | accessdate=2006-09-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; Researchers at [[University of Pittsburgh]] and [[Georgia Tech]] performed extensive benchmarking simulations on mixtures of several light metal hydrides to predict possible reaction thermodynamics for hydrogen storage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title = Examining the robustness of first-principles calculations for metal hydride reaction thermodynamics by detection of metastable reaction pathways|author1=Ki Chul Kim |author2=Anant D.

==== Non-metal hydrides ====
The Italian [[catalyst]] manufacturer [[Acta (chemical company)|Acta]] has proposed using [[Hydrazine#Fuel cells|hydrazine as an alternative to hydrogen]] in [[fuel cell]]s. As the hydrazine fuel is liquid at room temperature, it can be handled and stored more easily than hydrogen. By storing it in a tank full of a double-bonded [[carbon]]-[[oxygen]] [[carbonyl]], it reacts and forms a safe solid called [[hydrazone]]. By then flushing the tank with warm water, the liquid hydrazine hydrate is released. Hydrazine breaks down in the cell to form [[nitrogen]] and [[hydrogen]] which bonds with oxygen, releasing water.&lt;ref name="The Engineer"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theengineer.co.uk/Articles/303939/Liquid+asset.htm |title=Liquid asset |work=The Engineer |date=2008-01-15 |accessdate=2015-01-09 }}{{dead link|date=April 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; Silicon hydrides and germanium hydrides are also candidates of hydrogen storage materials, as they can subject to energetically favored reaction to form covalently bonded dimers with loss of a hydrogen molecule.&lt;ref&gt;Zong, J., J.

==== Carbohydrates ====
[[Carbohydrates]] (polymeric C&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;10&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;) releases H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; in a bioreformer mediated by the enzyme cocktail—cell-free synthetic pathway biotransformation. Carbohydrate provides high hydrogen storage densities as a liquid with mild pressurization and cryogenic constraints: It can also be stored as a solid powder. Carbohydrate is the most abundant renewable bioresource in the world.

In May 2007 biochemical engineers from the [[Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University]] and biologists and chemists from the Oak Ridge National Laboratory announced a method of producing high-yield pure hydrogen from starch and water.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0000456 |title=High-Yield Hydrogen Production from Starch and Water by a Synthetic Enzymatic Pathway|year=2007|editor1-last=Melis|editor1-first=Anastasios|last1=Zhang|first1=Y.-H.

==== Synthesized hydrocarbons ====
An alternative to hydrides is to use regular [[hydrocarbon]] fuels as the hydrogen carrier. Then a small [[hydrogen reformer]] would extract the hydrogen as needed by the [[fuel cell]]. However, these reformers are slow to react to changes in demand and add a large incremental cost to the vehicle powertrain.

[[Direct methanol fuel cell]]s do not require a reformer, but provide a lower energy density compared to conventional fuel cells, although this could be counterbalanced with the much better energy densities of [[ethanol]] and [[methanol]] over hydrogen. [[Alcohol fuel]] is a [[renewable resource]].

[[Solid-oxide fuel cells]] can operate on light hydrocarbons such as [[propane]] and [[methane]] without a reformer, or can run on higher hydrocarbons with only partial reforming, but the high temperature and slow startup time of these fuel cells are problematic for automotive applications.

===== Aluminum =====
{{Main|Aluminum}}

[[Aluminum]] has been proposed as an [[energy storage]] method by a number of researchers. [[hydrogen]] can be extracted from aluminum by reacting it with water.&lt;ref name="Alchemy white paper"&gt;[http://www.alcres.com/docs/alydro-energy-storage.pdf White Paper: A Novel Method For Grid Energy Storage Using Aluminum Fuel] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130531060548/http://www.alcres.com/docs/alydro-energy-storage.pdf |date=2013-05-31 }}, Alchemy Research, April 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; To react with water, however, aluminum must be stripped of its natural [[oxide]] layer, a process which requires pulverization,&lt;ref name="Army"&gt;{{cite web |title=Army discovery may offer new energy source {{!}} U.S. Army Research Laboratory |url=https://www.arl.army.mil/www/default.cfm?article=3036 |website=www.arl.army.mil |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; chemical reactions with caustic substances, or alloys.&lt;ref name="Woodall"&gt;{{cite web |title=New process generates hydrogen from aluminum alloy to run engines, fuel cells |url=https://phys.org/news/2007-05-hydrogen-aluminum-alloy-fuel-cells.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; The byproduct of the reaction to create hydrogen is [[aluminum oxide]], which can be recycled back into aluminum with the [[Hall–Héroult process]], making the reaction theoretically renewable.

==== Liquid organic hydrogen carriers (LOHC) ====
[[File:Perhydro-N-Carbazol.PNG|right|thumb|upright=1.25|Reversible hydrogenation of N-ethylcarbazole]]
Unsaturated organic compounds can store huge amounts of hydrogen. These ''Liquid Organic Hydrogen Carriers'' (LOHC) are hydrogenated for storage and dehydrogenated again when the energy/hydrogen is needed. Research on LOHC was concentrated on cycloalkanes at an early stage, with its relatively high hydrogen capacity (6-8 wt %) and production of CO&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;-free hydrogen.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Liquid organic hydrogen carriers|url = http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2095495615000546|journal = Journal of Energy Chemistry|date = 2015-09-01|pages = 587–594|volume = 24|issue = 5|doi = 10.1016/j.jechem.2015.08.007|first = Teng|last = He|first2 = Qijun|last2 = Pei|first3 = Ping|last3 = Chen}}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Heterocyclic compounds|Heterocyclic aromatic compounds]] (or N-Heterocycles) are also appropriate for this task.

Using LOHCs relatively high gravimetric storage densities can be reached (about 6 wt-%) and the overall energy efficiency is higher than for other chemical storage options such as [[Hydrogen storage#Synthesized hydrocarbons|producing methane from the hydrogen]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1002/cite.201100113 | volume=83 | issue=11 | title=Energiespeicherung mittels Methan und energietragenden Stoffen - ein thermodynamischer Vergleich |trans-title=Energy Storage by CO2 [[Methane|Methanization]] and Energy Carrying Compounds: A Thermodynamic Comparison|language=de| year=2011 | journal=Chemie Ingenieur Technik | pages=2002–2013 | last1 = Müller | first1 = Benjamin}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cycloalkanes reported as LOHC include cyclohexane, methyl-cyclohexane and decalin.

==== Ammonia ====
{{Further|Ammonia production}}
[[Ammonia]] (NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;) releases H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; in an appropriate catalytic reformer. Ammonia provides high hydrogen storage densities as a liquid with mild pressurization and cryogenic constraints: It can also be stored as a liquid at room temperature and pressure when mixed with water. Ammonia is the second most commonly produced chemical in the world and a large infrastructure for making, transporting, and distributing ammonia exists. Ammonia can be reformed to produce hydrogen with no harmful waste, or can mix with existing fuels and under the right conditions burn efficiently. Since there is no carbon in ammonia, no carbon by-products are produced; thereby making this possibility a "carbon neutral" option for the future. Pure ammonia burns poorly at the atmospheric pressures found in natural gas fired water heaters and stoves. Under compression in an automobile engine it is a suitable fuel for slightly modified gasoline engines. Ammonia is the suitable alternative fuel because it has 18.6 MJ/kg energy density at NTP and carbon-free combustion byproducts.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=AVERY|first=W|date=1988|title=A role for ammonia in the hydrogen economy|url=https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/0360319988900377|journal=International Journal of Hydrogen Energy|volume=13|issue=12|pages=761–773|doi=10.1016/0360-3199(88)90037-7|issn=0360-3199}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, ammonia is a toxic gas at normal temperature and pressure and has a potent odor.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.memagazine.org/contents/current/webonly/webex710.html The ammonia economy] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080513030624/http://www.memagazine.org/contents/current/webonly/webex710.html |date=2008-05-13 }}.

==== Amine borane complexes ====
{{Main article|Amine borane complex}}
Prior to 1980, several compounds were investigated for hydrogen storage including complex borohydrides, or aluminohydrides, and ammonium salts. These hydrides have an upper theoretical hydrogen yield limited to about 8.5% by weight. Amongst the compounds that contain only B, N, and H (both positive and negative ions), representative examples include: amine boranes, boron hydride ammoniates, hydrazine-borane complexes, and ammonium octahydrotriborates or tetrahydroborates. Of these, amine boranes (and especially [[ammonia borane]]) have been extensively investigated as hydrogen carriers. During the 1970s and 1980s, the U.S. Army and Navy funded efforts aimed at developing hydrogen/deuterium gas-generating compounds for use in the HF/DF and HCl chemical [[laser]]s, and gas dynamic lasers. Earlier hydrogen gas-generating formulations used amine boranes and their derivatives. Ignition of the amine borane(s) forms [[boron nitride]] (BN) and hydrogen gas. In addition to ammonia borane
(H&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;BNH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;), other gas-generators include diborane diammoniate, H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;B(NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;BH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;.

====Imidazolium ionic liquids====
In 2007 [[Jairton Dupont|Dupont]] and others reported hydrogen-storage materials based on imidazolium ionic liquids. Simple alkyl(aryl)-3-methylimidazolium N-bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)imidate salts that possess very low vapour pressure, high density, and thermal stability and are not inflammable can add reversibly 6–12 hydrogen atoms in the presence of classical Pd/C or Ir0 nanoparticle catalysts and can be used as alternative materials for on-board hydrogen-storage devices. These salts can hold up to 30 g L&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; of hydrogen at atmospheric pressure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1021/ef060481t|title=Hydrogen-Storage Materials Based on Imidazolium Ionic Liquids|year=2007|last1=Stracke|first1=Marcelo P.|last2=Ebeling|first2=Günter|last3=Cataluña|first3=Renato|last4=Dupont|first4=Jairton|journal=Energy &amp; Fuels|volume=21|issue=3|pages=1695–1698}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Phosphonium borate====
In 2006 researchers of [[University of Windsor]] reported on reversible hydrogen storage in a non-metal phosphonium borate [[frustrated Lewis pair]]:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Reversible, Metal-Free Hydrogen Activation|doi=10.1126/science.1134230|year=2006|last1=Welch|first1=G.

The phosphino-borane on the left accepts one equivalent of hydrogen at one atmosphere and 25&amp;nbsp;°C and expels it again by heating to 100&amp;nbsp;°C. The storage capacity is 0.25 wt% still rather below the 6 to 9 wt% required for practical use.

==== Carbonite substances ====
Research has proven that [[graphene]] can store hydrogen efficiently. After taking up hydrogen, the substance becomes [[graphane]]. After tests, conducted by dr André Geim at the [[University of Manchester]], it was shown that not only can graphene store hydrogen easily, it can also release the hydrogen again, after heating to 450&amp;nbsp;°C.&lt;ref&gt;[http://physicsworld.com/cws/article/news/22689 Graphene as suitable hydrogen storage substance].

Retrieved on 2012-01-08.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Metal-organic frameworks====
[[Metal-organic framework]]s represent another class of synthetic porous materials that store hydrogen and energy at the molecular level. MOFs are highly crystalline inorganic-organic hybrid structures that contain metal clusters or ions (secondary building units) as nodes and organic ligands as linkers. When guest molecules (solvent) occupying the pores are removed during solvent exchange and heating under vacuum, porous structure of MOFs can be achieved without destabilizing the frame and hydrogen molecules will be adsorbed onto the surface of the pores by physisorption. Compared to traditional zeolites and porous carbon materials, MOFs have very high number of pores and surface area which allow higher hydrogen uptake in a given volume. Thus, research interests on hydrogen storage in MOFs have been growing since 2003 when the first MOF-based hydrogen storage was introduced. Since there are infinite geometric and chemical variations of MOFs based on different combinations of SBUs and linkers, many researches explore what combination will provide the maximum hydrogen uptake by varying materials of metal ions and linkers.

In 2006, chemists at [[UCLA]] and the [[University of Michigan]] have achieved hydrogen storage concentrations of up to 7.5 wt% in MOF-74 at a low temperature of 77 [[Kelvin|K]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nist.gov/public_affairs/techbeat/tb2008_0401.htm#hydrogen MOF-74 – A Potential Hydrogen-Storage Compound].

Green Car Congress (2006-03-06). Retrieved on 2012-01-08.&lt;/ref&gt; In 2009, researchers at [[University of Nottingham]] reached 10 wt% at 77 bar (1,117 psi) and 77 K with MOF NOTT-112.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.greencarcongress.com/2009/02/new-mof-materia.html New MOF Material With hydrogen Uptake Of Up To 10 wt%]. 22 February 2009&lt;/ref&gt; Most articles about hydrogen storage in MOFs report hydrogen uptake capacity at a temperature of 77K and a pressure of 1 bar because these conditions are commonly available and the binding energy between hydrogen and the MOF at this temperature is large compared to the thermal vibration energy. Varying several factors such as surface area, pore size, catenation, ligand structure, and sample purity can result in different amounts of hydrogen uptake in MOFs.

====Encapsulation====
[[Cella Energy]] technology is based around the encapsulation of hydrogen gas and nano-structuring of chemical hydrides in small plastic balls, at room temperature and pressure.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cellaenergy.com Cella Energy]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Physical storage===

In this case hydrogen remains in physical forms, i.e., as gas, supercritical fluid, adsorbate, or molecular inclusions. Theoretical limitations and experimental results are considered &lt;ref&gt;Compendium of Hydrogen Energy.Volume 2:hydrogen Storage, Transportation and Infrastructure. A volume in Woodhead Publishing Series in Energy 2016,Chapter 8 – Other methods for the physical storage of hydrogen {{DOI|10.1016/B978-1-78242-362-1.00008-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;
concerning the volumetric and gravimetric capacity of glass microvessels, microporous, and nanoporous media, as well as safety and refilling-time demands.

==== Activated carbons ====
Activated carbons are highly porous amorphous carbon materials with high apparent surface area. Hydrogen [[physisorption]] can be increased in these materials by increasing the apparent surface area and optimizing pore diameter to around 7 Å.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Sevilla|first=Marta|last2=Mokaya|first2=Robert|date=2014-03-21|title=Energy storage applications of activated carbons: supercapacitors and hydrogen storage|url=http://xlink.rsc.org/?DOI=C3EE43525C|journal=Energy Environ.

====Cryo-compressed====

Cryo-compressed storage of hydrogen is the only technology that meets 2015 DOE targets for volumetric and gravimetric efficiency (see "CcH2" on slide 6 in &lt;ref name="hydrogen.energy.gov"/&gt;).

Furthermore, another study has shown that cryo-compressed exhibits interesting cost advantages: ownership cost (price per mile) and storage system cost (price per vehicle) are actually the lowest when compared to any other technology (see third row in slide 13 of &lt;ref&gt;Stephen Lasher [http://www.hydrogen.energy.gov/pdfs/review10/st002_lasher_2010_o_web.pdf Analyses of Hydrogen Storage Materials and On-Board Systems]. DOE Annual Merit Review June 7–11, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;). For example, a cryo-compressed hydrogen system would cost $0.12 per mile (including cost of fuel and every associated other cost), while conventional gasoline vehicles cost between $0.05 and $0.07 per mile.

Like liquid storage, cryo-compressed uses cold hydrogen (20.3 K and slightly above) in order to reach a high energy density. However, the main difference is that, when the hydrogen would warm-up due to heat transfer with the environment ("boil off"), the tank is allowed to go to pressures much higher (up to 350 bars versus a couple of bars for liquid storage). As a consequence, it takes more time before the hydrogen has to vent, and in most driving situations, enough hydrogen is used by the car to keep the pressure well below the venting limit.

Consequently, it has been demonstrated that a high driving range could be achieved with a cryo-compressed tank : more than {{convert|650|mi|km}} were driven with a full tank mounted on an hydrogen-fueled engine of [[Toyota Prius]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.llnl.gov/str/June07/Aceves.html S&amp;TR | Setting a World Driving Record with Hydrogen].

====Carbon nanotubes====
[[Image:Carbon nanotubes.jpg|thumb|upright|Carbon nanotubes]]

Hydrogen carriers based on nanostructured carbon (such as carbon [[fullerene|buckyballs]] and [[Carbon nanotube|nanotubes]]) have been proposed. However, since Hydrogen usually amounts up to ~3.0-7.0 wt% at 77K which is far from the value set by US department of Energy (6 wt% at nearly ambient conditions), it makes carbon materials poor candidates for hydrogen storage.

====Clathrate hydrates====
[[hydrogen clathrate|H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; caged]] in a [[clathrate hydrate]] was first reported in 2002, but requires very high pressures to be stable. In 2004, researchers from [[Delft University of Technology]] and [[Colorado School of Mines]] showed solid H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-containing hydrates could be formed at ambient temperature and 10s of [[Bar (unit)|bar]] by adding small amounts of promoting substances such as [[THF]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1126/science.1102076|title=Stable Low-Pressure Hydrogen Clusters Stored in a Binary Clathrate Hydrate|year=2004|last1=Florusse|first1=L.

==Stationary hydrogen storage==
Unlike mobile applications, hydrogen density is not a huge problem for stationary applications. As for mobile applications, stationary applications can use established technology:

===Power to gas===
[[Power to gas]] is a technology which converts [[electricity|electrical]] power to a gas [[fuel]]. There are two methods: the first is to use the electricity for [[water splitting]] and inject the resulting hydrogen into the natural gas grid; the second, less efficient method is used to convert [[carbon dioxide]] and hydrogen to [[methane]], (see [[natural gas]]) using [[electrolysis]] and the [[Sabatier reaction]]. A third option is to combine the hydrogen via electrolysis with a source of carbon (either carbon dioxide or carbon monoxide from [[biogas]], from industrial processes or via [[Carbon_dioxide_removal#Direct_air_capture_(DAC)|direct air-captured carbon dioxide]]) via [[biomethanation]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Rathi|first1=Akshat|title=Batteries can't solve the world's biggest energy-storage problem.

The UK has completed surveys and is preparing to start injecting hydrogen into the gas grid as the grid previously carried 'town gas' which is a 50% hydrogen-methane gas formed from coal. Auditors KPMG found that converting the UK to hydrogen gas could be £150bn to £200bn cheaper than rewiring British homes to use electric heating powered by lower-carbon sources.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Ambrose |first1=Jillian |title=Energy networks prepare to blend hydrogen into the gas grid for the first time |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/business/2018/01/06/hydrogen/ |newspaper=The Telegraph |accessdate=22 April 2018 |date=2018-01-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Excess power or off peak power generated by wind generators or solar arrays can then be used for load balancing in the energy grid.

The storage capacity of the German natural gas network is more than 200,000 GW·h which is enough for several months of energy requirement. By comparison, the capacity of all German pumped storage power plants amounts to only about 40 GW·h. The transport of energy through a gas network is done with much less loss (&lt;0.1%) than in a power network (8%). The use of the existing [[List of natural gas pipelines|natural gas pipelines]] for hydrogen was studied by NaturalHy&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.naturalhy.net/docs/Naturalhy_Brochure.pdf Naturalhy] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120118102741/http://www.naturalhy.net/docs/Naturalhy_Brochure.pdf |date=2012-01-18 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Targets were set by the [[FreedomCAR]] Partnership in January 2002 between the United States Council for Automotive Research (USCAR) and [[United States Department of Energy|U.S. DOE]] (Targets assume a 5-kg H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; storage system). The 2005 targets were not reached in 2005.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.uscar.org/commands/files_download.php?files_id=82 Hydrogen Storage Technologies Roadmap]. uscar.org. November 2005&lt;/ref&gt; The targets were revised in 2009 to reflect new data on system efficiencies obtained from fleets of test cars.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Yang|first=Jun|author2=Sudik, A |author3=Wolverton, C |author4= Siegel, DJ |title=High capacity hydrogen storage materials: attributes for automotive applications and techniques for materials discovery|journal=Chem.

It is important to note that these targets are for the hydrogen storage system, not the hydrogen storage material. System densities are often around half those of the working material, thus while a material may store 6 [[Mass fraction (chemistry)#Mass percentage|wt%]] H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, a working system using that material may only achieve 3 wt% when the weight of tanks, temperature and pressure control equipment, etc., is considered.

In 2010, only two storage technologies were identified as having the potential to meet DOE targets: MOF-177 exceeds 2010 target for volumetric capacity, while cryo-compressed H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; exceeds more restrictive 2015 targets for both gravimetric and volumetric capacity (see slide 6 in &lt;ref name="hydrogen.energy.gov"&gt;R.

Via '''deep [[water aeration]]''' or '''[[Hypolimnion|hypolimnetic]] aeration''', the [[oxygen]] demand of deep water is covered by oxygen from the atmosphere without destroying the lake’s natural [[Lake stratification|stratification]]. Thus the deep water becomes aerobic, the [[phosphate]] dissolution is reduced significantly and the mineralization of [[sediments]] improves.
Years of scientific evidence show that it is possible to keep the deep water aerobic all year round via technical ventilation measures and thereby to recover the natural balance of lakes effectively.&lt;ref name="Steinberg"&gt;Steinberg, C., Bernhardt, H.: Handbuch Angewandte Limnologie – 14. Erg.Lfg. 4/0 Verlag: Hüthig Jehle Rehm, 2002, {{ISBN|3-609-75820-1}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Eutrophication ==
In stratified, eutrophic lakes an oxygen deficit in deep water is created during summer stagnation. As a result of elevated nutrient inputs the trophic level of many lakes increases continuously. Elevated phosphorus concentrations may lead to stronger algae growth and a corresponding increase in oxygen consumption in the deep zones. 
In the anaerobic environment of deep water sludge accumulates, while concentrations of [[ammonium]], [[iron]], [[manganese]] and toxic [[hydrogen sulfide]] increase in the [[water body]].
The [[hypolimnion]] is now not only hostile, but the [[Hypoxia (environmental)|anaerobic conditions]] also cause increased phosphate dissolutions from the sediments into the deep water. These additional nutrient loads create further problems after the next full circulation. 
Particularly in terms of drinking water production in reservoirs and dams with respect to the existing regulations of the Drinking Water Ordinance,&lt;ref&gt;Verordnung über die Qualität von Wasser für den menschlichen Gebrauch (Trinkwasserverordnung) vom 21. Mai 2001. Zuletzt geändert durch Art. 3, Abs. 1, 2 vom 5. Dezember 2012. In: BGBl., Teil 1, Nr. 24: 959-969 (2001) und BGBl. I S. 2562 (2012)&lt;/ref&gt; these deteriorations in water status are a serious problem. The deep water aeration can prevent this process.

== Technical measures for hypolimnetic aeration ==
TIBEAN or TWBA stands for the German „Tiefenwasserbelüftungsanlage" which means „deep water aeration system". 
The TIBEAN - series are floating or submerse plants. They consist of one or more upstream pipes, where the water is aerated while rising up, a degassing chamber where the aerated water is freed of gases and one or more downstream pipes where the vented, [[degassed water]] is pumped back into the hypolimnion. In the degassing chamber additional nutrient absorbers and/ or nutrient precipitation devices can be implemented. [[File:TIBEAN Polycon Anlagenkomponenten.jpg|thumbnail|TIBEAN: technical components and functional principal]]

=== Technology ===
At the lower end of the plant atmospheric air is inserted into the water by an [[Injector|ejector]]. A mixture of water and oxygen is forced upwards in the upstream pipe. At the end of the upstream pipe the mixture flows into the degassing chamber. Residual gases are separated from the oxygenated water. The gas escapes into the [[atmosphere]], the oxygenated water flows back through the downstream pipe. The outlet provides a laminar flow and a horizontal outflow into the hypolimnion.&lt;ref&gt;Jaeger, D.: TIBEAN – a new hypolimnetic water aeration plant. Verb. Internat. Verein. Limnol. 24: 184-187, 1990&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Klapper, H. 1992"&gt;Klapper, H.: Eutrophierung und Gewässerschutz. Stuttgart, Jena: Gustav Fischer, 1992, {{ISBN|978-3-334-00394-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Thanks to the flow and mass transfer calculations which are performed in the context of the technical configuration, the optimal set-up can be determined.

=== Individual parts ===
# Floating tanks
# Upstream pipe (Telescope) 
# Degassing chamber
# Mixing device
# Suction fence 
# Covering fence
# Downstream pipe
# Oxygen input
# Submersible pump with ejector
# Main ballast tanks

=== Material ===
TIBEAN can be made of [[Polyethylene]], [[Polypropylene]], [[stainless steel]] and an Al/Mn- alloy. Thanks to best properties almost all facilities are made of thermoplastic materials (PE, PP) and thus are UV, weather and frost resistant.

== Applications ==
TIBEAN systems are highly variable and cover a very wide range of applications with an oxygen input from 1.5 to 60&amp;nbsp;kg/h, an application depth of 5 to 50 m and a flow rate from 600 to 7500 m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;/h.

The objectives for water body restoration or aquatic therapy can vary, depending on the priority. Therefore, the possibilities of deep water aeration systems as TIBEAN are diverse:
* Conservation of deep zones as aerobic habitat for fish and other higher organisms.&lt;ref&gt;Doke, J.L., Funk, W.H., Juul, S.T.J., Moore, B.C.: Habitat availability and benthic invertebrate population changes following alum treatment and hypolimnetic oxygenation in [[Newman Lake]], Washington. In: J. Freshwat. Ecol. 10: 87-100,1995.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Wehrli, B., Wüest, A.: Zehn Jahre Seenbelüftung: Erfahrungen und Optionen. EAWAG, Dübenedorf-Zürich, Schweiz,1996, {{ISBN|3-906484-14-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Reduction of nutrient concentration in surface waters.&lt;ref name="Steinberg" /&gt;
* Prevention of sludge formation, increased ammonium production and the formation of toxic hydrogen sulfide.&lt;ref name="Steinberg" /&gt;
* Cost reduction for drinking water production.&lt;ref name="Steinberg" /&gt;
* Targeted treatment of deep water with coagulants.

=== Drinking water production in water reservoir dams ===
Especially in respect of drinking water production, deep-water aeration allows a significant reduction of production costs and facilitates further technical treatment of the hypolimnic water.&lt;ref name="Steinberg" /&gt; Since water for drinking water production is drawn from below the thermocline in most reservoirs, an improved hypolimnic water quality has direct influence on the production of drinking water. With regard to the applicable limiting values of drinking water regulations, the following effects can be achieved via deep-water aeration:

==== pH and corrosion ====
For the [[pH]] of drinking water, the threshold value is 6.5 - 9.5. pH values outside the neutral range (pH 6.5 - 7.5) are principally critical, since they provide an indication of the [[corrosion]] behaviour of water. Slightly acidic water (pH 4 - 6.5) usually corrodes galvanized iron pipes, but also [[copper]] and asbestos cement pipes.&lt;ref name="Trinkwasserparameter"&gt;Die Bedeutung einzelnen Trinkwasserparameter, Wasserverband Großraum Ansfelden, 29.08.2003,  http://wasserverbandansfelden.riscompany.net/medien/download/50330502_1.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; This process is known as acid corrosion. Practical experience has shown that the use of unprotected steel pipes is only possible at neutral pH values. By lower pH values, the removal of the pure zinc layer is promoted.&lt;ref name="Korrosion"&gt;Wasserqualität: Spezialteil Korrosion, www.waterquality.de, know-how online, http://www.waterquality.de/trinkwasser/K.HTM&lt;/ref&gt; As a result of the dissolved salts and gases, natural cold waters usually show a slightly [[alkalinity|alkaline]] reaction. These properties are created by setting the equilibrium concentrations of dissolved [[carbon dioxide]] in the form of bicarbonate ions and carbonate ions. Higher alkaline pH values (pH 9 - 14) in the presence of oxygen as an oxidant lead to so-called oxygen corrosion. To avoid the described acid or oxygen corrosion, [[buffer solution]]s are added to the raw water for drinking water production. By the pH-stabilizing effect of hypolimnetic aeration, the application of these buffer solutions can be reduced, thus reducing operating costs.&lt;ref name="Steinberg" /&gt;

==== Iron and manganese ====
For concentrations of iron and manganese in drinking water, the threshold values are 200&amp;nbsp;µg/l and 50&amp;nbsp;µg/l respectively. Although they serve as essential [[trace element]]s in drinking water, slightly elevated iron and manganese concentrations are undesirable from a technical and hygienic point of view.&lt;ref name="Trinkwasserparameter" /&gt; At low oxygen concentrations, iron and manganese are dissolved as ions. The naturally occurring iron and manganese is mainly present as divalent, soluble ferrous/ manganous compound. At very high concentrations, a yellow water colour is noticeable. When this water is aerated, the oxidization creates ferric iron/ manganese, with iron forming red-brown and manganese forming black precipitates. These precipitates cause staining and turbidity of the water and lead to laundry stains. The precipitates can also narrow pipes and deposit on mountings. Iron levels above 0.3&amp;nbsp;mg/l and manganese levels above 0.5&amp;nbsp;mg/l become noticeable as an unpleasant metallic taste.&lt;ref name="Trinkwasserparameter" /&gt; Providing an aerobic hypolimnic environment, deep-water aeration oxidizes and precipitates dissolved iron and manganese compounds, before the water is treated in a suitable facility for drinking water production. In this way further operating costs for the removal of dissolved iron and manganese compounds can be realized.

The amount and mobility of iron species also influences the redox-controlled phosphorus household.&lt;ref&gt;Lean, D.R.S., McQueen, D.J., Story, V.R.: Phosphate transport during hypolimnetic aeration. Arch. Hydrobiol. 108, 269-280, 1986.&lt;/ref&gt; Divalent iron compounds successively diffusing from anaerobic sediment layers are oxidized at the boundary zone between aerobic water and anaerobic sediment, and accumulate at the top sediment layer. The stronger this accumulation, the more effective the aerobic boundary between sediment and water can act as a [[diffusion]] barrier for phosphate.&lt;ref name="Steinberg" /&gt;

==== Nutrient concentrations and sludge formation ====
As already mentioned, the deep-water aeration can reduce nutrient concentrations significantly. Aerobic conditions promote [[nitrification]] and subsequent [[denitrification]] thus contributing to nitrogen discharge of the system.&lt;ref name="Steinberg" /&gt; The chemical and microbial oxidation of reduced substances such as hydrogen sulfide and methane as well as the intensified degradation of organic matter can reduce the sludge formation. Aerobic conditions in the deep-water are also an important factor to decrease the redox-controlled redissolution of phosphorus from the sediment and to allow reprecipitation of released phosphorus. In this way the deep-water aeration additionally reduces costs for drinking water production by waiving denitrification stages or reducing the use of costly flocculants.&lt;ref name="Steinberg" /&gt;

== Planning and design ==
The final design of plants is carried out in different phases. The first step should always be a [[Echo sounding|morphometric measurement]] of the water body in order to assess the depth profile and the associated requirements for the technical design, and later on to determine the optimal location of the plant.
The exact technical design requires the evaluation of various measurements of parameters such as nutrient concentrations, temperature stratification, pH, temporal variations of oxygen concentrations as well as calculations of flow rates, mass transport quantities and distribution of [[suspended solids]] in the hypolymnion.

'''Iron stress repressed RNA''' (IsrR) is a cis-encoded [[antisense]] RNA which regulates the expression of the photosynthetic protein isiA. IsiA expression is activated by the [[Ferric uptake regulator family|Ferric uptake regulator protein]] (Fur) under [[iron]] stress conditions. IsiA enhances photosynthesis by forming a ring around [[photosystem I]] which acts as an additional antenna complex.&lt;ref name="pmid16636284"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Dühring U, Axmann IM, Hess WR, Wilde A |title=An internal antisense RNA regulates expression of the photosynthesis gene isiA |journal=Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. |volume=103 |issue=18 |pages=7054–8 |date=May 2006 |pmid=16636284 |pmc=1459017 |doi=10.1073/pnas.0600927103 |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

IsrR is abundant when there is a sufficient iron concentration. IsrR is encoded for within the opposite stand of isiA gene and contains a conserved [[stem loop]] secondary structure. Under sufficient iron conditions IsrR binds to its complementary region which corresponds to the central third of the isiA [[mRNA]]. The resulting duplex RNA is then targeted for degradation. This allows the antisense RNA to act as a reversible switch that responds to changes in environmental conditions to modulate the expression of the isiA protein.

IsrR was originally identified within cyanobacteria but may be conserved throughout a number of photosynthetic species from multiple kingdoms. At present, IsrR is the only non coding RNA identified that has a regulatory role on photosynthetic proteins.

The '''Land Reform (Scotland) Act 2016''' is an [[Act of the Scottish Parliament]] which continues the process of [[land reform in Scotland]] following the [[Community Empowerment (Scotland) Act 2015]]. It is notable for granting [[Scottish ministers]] the power to force the sale of private land to community bodies to further [[sustainable development]] in the absence of a willing seller.

==Provisions==

Under the provisions of the act there is to be a ‘Land Rights and Responsibilities Statement’, setting out the Scottish Government’s objectives for [[Land reform in Scotland|land reform]], a [[Scottish Land Commission]] is to take forward the land reform process, preparing a strategic plan, for the approval of Scottish ministers. One of the new land commissioners is to be a Tenant Farming Commissioner who must be neither an agricultural landlord nor a tenant but who is to be responsible for reviewing issues relating to [[tenant farming]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Blair|first1=Mike|title=A Brief Guide to Land Reform in Scotland|url=http://www.gillespiemacandrew.co.uk/media/340813/land-reform-act-2016.pdf|publisher=Gillespie Macandrew LLP|accessdate=5 March 2017|date=April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A further provision is the creation of the Community Right to Buy for Sustainable Development. This permits Scottish ministers to approve the purchase of privately owned land by a community body with a registered interest. Unlike the Community Right to Buy established by the [[Land Reform (Scotland) Act 2003]] and extended by the [[Community Empowerment (Scotland) Act 2015]], the Community Right to Buy for Sustainable Development does not require a willing seller but allows ministers to compel landowners to sell if they decide that the sale will further sustainable development in the area. In this respect it is similar to the Crofting Community Right to Buy of the 2003 Act which allows [[crofting]] communities to purchase croft land and the Community Right to Buy abandoned or derelict land of the 2015 Act, neither of which require a willing seller.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Community rights to buy in Scotland – which is which, and what are they for?|url=http://www.brodies.com/node/8185|website=Brodies|accessdate=5 March 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Community bodies may also register an interest in allowing a 3rd party to purchase land on the same basis. 

Other provisions of the act include new regulations to require persons who control land to be identified, with information obtained to appear in the Land Register of Scotland; the removal of sporting rights exemption from rates, which are to be re-valued; and further powers for [[Scottish Natural Heritage]] to control deer management. It also makes provision for notice and consultation where core paths are to be amended.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Land Reform (Scotland) Act 2016|url=http://www.legislation.gov.uk/asp/2016/18/pdfs/asp_20160018_en.pdf|accessdate=5 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In biochemistry, the '''metallome''' distribution of free [[metal]] [[ions]] in every one of [[Cell (biology)|cellular]] compartments. The term was defined in analogy with [[proteome]] as&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Williams|2001}}&lt;/ref&gt; '''metallomics''' is  the study of metallome: the  "comprehensive analysis of the entirety of metal and metalloid species within a cell or tissue type".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Szpunar|2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, metallomics can be considered a branch of [[metabolomics]],{{cn|date=January 2018}} even though the metals are not typically considered as [[metabolites]].

An alternative definition of "metallomes" as [[metalloprotein]]s or any other metal-containing [[biomolecules]], and "metallomics" as a study of such biomolecules.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Haraguchi|2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

==Metallointeractome==
In the study of metallomes the [[transcriptome]], proteome and the [[metabolome]] constitutes the whole metallome. A study of the metallome is done to arrive at the '''metallointeractome'''.

==Metallotranscriptome==
The '''metallotranscriptome'''&lt;ref name="Shanker2009"&gt;{{harvnb|Shanker|Djanaguiraman|Venkateswarlu|2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; can be defined as the map of the entire transcriptome in the presence of biologically or environmentally relevant concentrations of an essential or toxic metal, respectively. The metallometabolome constitutes the complete pool of small metabolites in a cell at any given time. This gives rise to the whole metallointeractome and knowledge of this is important in comparative metallomics dealing with toxicity and drug discovery.&lt;ref name="Shanker2009" /&gt;

==Early life, education, and early career==
Joel grew up in Montreal, with three brothers. His family was an early adopter of computers, something that fascinated him.&lt;ref name="G&amp;M profile"/&gt; He graduated from the pre-university music program at [[Vanier College]] (he played [[bass (instrument)|bass]]),&lt;ref name="Babylon"/&gt; then he quit his philosophy studies at [[Concordia University]] after less than a semester, to start a publishing career.&lt;ref name="clients"&gt;{{cite news |url= https://www.theglobeandmail.com/report-on-business/small-business/sb-digital/biz-categories-technology/social-media-can-pull-in-clients/article4187366/ |title=Social media can pull in clients |work=The Globe and Mail |author=Catherine McLean |date=October 20, 2009 |accessdate=June 21, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; He worked in [[Montreal]] as a freelance music journalist and as publisher/editor of two music magazines, ''Arena Rock'' and ''Enrage''.&lt;ref name="Babylon"/&gt; His first interview, in 1989, was of [[Tommy Lee]].&lt;ref name="Rules"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://metal-rules.com/interviews/distortent.htm |title=Distort Entertainment's Mitch Joel: New Canadian Label Signing Heavy Bands |author=Keith McDonald |work=Metal-Rules.com |year=2002 |accessdate=June 24, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2701">'''Morisita's overlap index''', named after [[:ja:森下正明|Masaaki Morisita]], is a [[dispersion (statistics)|statistical measure of dispersion]] of individuals in a population.  It is used to compare overlap among [[Sample (statistics)|samples]] (Morisita 1959).  This formula is based on the assumption that increasing the size of the samples will increase the diversity because it will include different habitats (i.e. different faunas).

Formula:

: &lt;math&gt;C_D= \frac{2\sum_{i=1}^S x_i y_i }{(D_x + D_y) XY }&lt;/math&gt;

: ''x''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; is the number of times species ''i'' is represented in the total ''X'' from one sample.
: ''y''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; is the number of times species ''i'' is represented in the total ''Y'' from another sample.
: ''D''&lt;sub&gt;''x''&lt;/sub&gt; and ''D''&lt;sub&gt;''y''&lt;/sub&gt; are the [[Simpson's index]] values for the ''x'' and ''y'' samples respectively.
: ''S'' is the number of unique species

[[File:Klaviatur-3-en.svg|thumb|right|Layout of a [[musical keyboard]] (three [[octave]]s shown).]]

In [[music]], '''gesture''' is any movement, either physical (bodily) or mental (imaginary). As such "gesture" includes both categories of movements required to produce sound and categories of perceptual moves associated with those gestures. The concept of musical gestures has received much attention in various musicological disciplines (e.g. [[musical analysis|music analysis]], [[music therapy]],  [[music psychology]], [[NIME]]) in recent years.

For example, the "musical" movement from a [[voicing (music)|close-position]] [[tonic (music)|tonic]] C [[major chord]] to a close-position [[dominant (music)|dominant]] G major chord requires on the [[piano]] the physical movement from each white key of the first chord to the right (in space, upwards in pitch) four white [[key (instrument)|keys]] or [[steps and skips|steps]]. Thus gesture includes both characteristic physical movements by performers and characteristic [[melody|melodies]], [[phrase (music)|phrases]], [[chord progression]]s, and [[arpeggio|arpeggiations]] produced by (or producing) those movements.

==Introduction==
The concept of musical gestures encompasses a large territory stretching from details of sound-production to more global emotive and aesthetic images of music, and also include considerations of cultural-stylistic vs. more universal modes of expression. In all cases, it is believed that musical gestures manifest the primordial role of human movement in music. For this reason, scholars speak of [[embodied music cognition]] in the sense that listeners relate musical sound to mental images of gestures, i.e. that listening (or even merely imagining music) also is a process of incessant mental re-enactment of musical gestures.

Acknowledging the [[wikt:Special:Search/multimodal|multimodal]] nature of music perception, embodied music cognition could represent a change of [[paradigm]] in music theory and other music related research, research which has often tended to exclude considerations of bodily movement from its conceptual apparatus in favour of focus on more abstract, notation-based elements of music. Focusing on musical gestures provides a coherent and unifying perspective for a renewal of music theory and other music research.

==Music-related body movement==
A subset of musical gestures is what could be called music-related body movement, which can be seen from either the performer's or the perceiver's point of view:
* Performer - movements that are part of a music performance or a performance with music:
** Sound-producing: musician or actor creating musical sound.
** Sound-accompanying: dance or other types of movements that are linked to music.
* Perceiver - movements that are an integral part of music listening:
** Directly connected: dance, air performance
** Loosely connected: running, training.
** Grooving: tapping a foot, nodding the head, etc.

== Formal definition ==

The first mathematical definition of gesture is given in the paper  "Formulas, Diagrams, and Gestures in Music" (Journal of Mathematics and Music, Vol 1, Nr. 1 2007) by [[Guerino Mazzola]] (University of Minnesota) and Moreno Andreatta (IRCAM in Paris). A gesture is a configuration of curves in space and time. More formally, a gesture is a digraph morphism from a "skeleton" of addressed points to a "body", a spatial digraph of a topological category (in the musical case: time, position and pitch). Since the set of gestures of given skeleton and topological category defines a topological category, one may define gestures of gestures, so-called hypergestures.

==Gesture in Indian vocal music==
{{see|Music of India}}
Indian vocalists move their hands while improvising melody.  Although every vocalist has an idiosyncratic gestural style, the motion of the hand and voice are connected through various logics, and many students gesturally resemble their teachers.  Nikki Moran, at the University of London, has done research on this topic, and it is one of the subjects of [[Martin Clayton (ethnomusicologist)|Martin Clayton]] and Laura Leante's Musical Experience Project at the Open University.

Clayton has published a paper on gestural interaction in Indian music performance: "Time, Gesture and Attention in a Khyal Performance." ''Asian Music'', 38 (2), 71–96.

Matt Rahaim, a vocalist and ethnomusicologist, has published a book on the relationship between vocalization and gesture in Indian vocal music: ''Musicking Bodies: Gesture and Voice in Hindustani Music''.  Rahaim's work approaches gesture and vocalization as parallel expressions of melody, investigates isomorphisms between gesture space and raga space, and studies the transmission and inheritance of "paramparic bodies"--vocal/postural/gestural dispositions handed down through teaching lineages.

==Hatten's Musical Gestures==
Robert Hatten (2004)&lt;ref&gt;Hatten, Robert (2004). ''Interpreting Musical Gestures, Topics, and Tropes: Mozart, Beethoven, Schubert'', {{page needed|date=December 2010}}. {{ISBN|0-253-34459-X}}.&lt;/ref&gt; has been using the concept of musical gestures to denote inner-musical qualities:
&lt;blockquote&gt;"Musical gesture is biologically and culturally grounded in communicative human movement. Gesture draws upon the close interaction (and intermodality) of a range of human perceptual and motor systems to synthesize the energetic shaping of motion through time into significant events with unique expressive force. The biological and cultural motivations of musical gesture are further negotiated within the conventions of a musical style, whose elements include both the discrete (pitch, rhythm, meter) and the analog (dynamics, articulation, temporal pacing). Musical gestures are emergent gestalts that convey affective motion, emotion, and agency by fusing otherwise separate elements into continuities of shape and force."&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in Bandt, Duffy, and MacKinnon (2007). ''Hearing Places'', p.355. {{ISBN|1-84718-255-0}}.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="22242">'''Nanoparticles for drug delivery to the brain''' is a method for transporting drug molecules across the [[blood–brain barrier]] (BBB) using [[nanoparticle]]s. These drugs cross the BBB and deliver pharmaceuticals to the brain for therapeutic treatment of neurological disorders. These disorders include [[Parkinson's disease]], [[Alzheimer's disease]], [[schizophrenia]], [[depression (mood)|depression]], and [[brain tumor]]s. Part of the difficulty in finding cures for these [[central nervous system]] (CNS) disorders is that there is yet no truly efficient delivery method for drugs to cross the BBB. [[Antibiotics]], [[Chemotherapy|antineoplastic agents]], and a variety of CNS-active drugs, especially [[neuropeptide]]s, are a few examples of molecules that cannot pass the BBB alone.&lt;ref name=Kreuter1&gt;{{cite journal|last=Kreuter|first=Jörg|title=Nanoparticulate systems for brain delivery of drugs|journal=Advanced Drug Delivery Reviews|year=2001|volume=47|issue=1|pages=65–81|doi=10.1016/S0169-409X(00)00122-8|pmid=11251246}}&lt;/ref&gt; With the aid of nanoparticle delivery systems, however, studies have shown that some drugs can now cross the BBB, and even exhibit lower [[toxicity]] and decrease adverse effects throughout the body. Toxicity is an important concept for [[pharmacology]] because high toxicity levels in the body could be detrimental to the patient by affecting other organs and disrupting their function.&lt;ref name=Kreuter2/&gt; Further, the BBB is not the only physiological barrier for [[drug delivery to the brain]]. Other biological factors influence how drugs are transported throughout the body and how they target specific locations for action. Some of these [[pathophysiology|pathophysiological]] factors include blood flow alterations, [[edema]] and increased [[intracranial pressure]], metabolic perturbations, and altered [[gene expression]] and [[protein synthesis]].&lt;ref name=Lo&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Lo EH, Singhal AB, Torchilin VP, Abbott NJ |title=Drug delivery to damaged brain |journal=Brain Res.

== Background ==
The first successful delivery of a drug across the BBB occurred in 2005. The drug used was hexapeptide dalargin, an anti-[[nociceptive]] peptide that cannot cross the BBB alone.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Das|first=Debanjan|author2=Lin, Senshang|title=Double-coated poly (butylcynanoacrylate) nanoparticulate delivery systems for brain targeting of dalargin via oral administration|journal=Journal of Pharmaceutical Sciences|date=June 2005|volume=94|issue=6|pages=1343–1353|doi=10.1002/jps.20357|pmid=15858853}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was encapsulated in [[polysorbate 80]] coated nanoparticles and [[intravenous therapy|intravenously injected]].&lt;ref name=Hwang/&gt; This was a huge breakthrough in the nanoparticle drug delivery field, and it helped advance research and development toward [[clinical trials]] of nanoparticle delivery systems. Nanoparticles range in size from 10 - 1000&amp;nbsp;nm (or 1&amp;nbsp;µm) and they can be made from natural or artificial [[polymer]]s, [[lipid]]s, [[dendrimer]]s, and [[micelle]]s.&lt;ref name=Kreuter1 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Hwang&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hwang|first=Seung Rim|author2=Kim, Kwangmeyung|title=Nano-enabled delivery systems across the blood-brain barrier|journal=Archives of Pharmacal Research|year=2013|pages=1–7}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most polymers used for nanoparticle drug delivery systems are natural, [[biocompatible]], and [[biodegradable]], which helps prevent contamination in the CNS. Several current methods for drug delivery to the brain include the use of [[liposome]]s, [[prodrug]]s, and [[Membrane transport protein|carrier-mediated transporters]]. Many different delivery methods exist to transport these drugs into the body, such as [[Oral administration|peroral]], [[Nasal administration|intranasal]], [[Intravenous therapy|intravenous]], and intracranial. For nanoparticles, most studies have shown increasing progression with intravenous delivery. Along with delivery and transport methods, there are several means of functionalizing, or [[activation|activating]], the nanoparticle carriers. These means include dissolving or absorbing a drug throughout the nanoparticle, encapsulating a drug inside the particle, or attaching a drug on the surface of the particle.&lt;ref name=Kreuter2/&gt;

== Types of nanoparticles for CNS drug delivery ==

=== Lipid-based ===
[[File:Liposome scheme-en.svg|thumb|left|Diagram of liposome showing a phospholipid bilayer surrounding an aqueous interior.]]

One type of nanoparticle involves use of [[liposome]]s as drug molecule carriers. The diagram on the right shows a standard liposome. It has a [[phospholipid bilayer]] separating the interior from the exterior of the cell.

Liposomes are composed of vesicular bilayers, [[lamella (materials)|lamella]]e, made of biocompatible and biodegradable lipids such as [[sphingomyelin]], [[phosphatidylcholine]], and [[glycerophospholipid]]s.&lt;ref name=Masserini&gt;{{cite journal|last=Masserini|first=Massimo|title=Nanoparticles for Brain Delivery|journal=ISRN Biochemistry|year=2013|volume=2013|pages=18|doi=10.1155/2013/238428}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Cholesterol]], a type of lipid, is also often incorporated in the lipid-nanoparticle formulation. Cholesterol can increase stability of a liposome and prevent leakage of a bilayer because its [[hydroxyl]] group can interact with the polar heads of the bilayer phospholipids. Liposomes have the potential to protect the drug from degradation, target sites for action, and reduce toxicity and adverse effects.&lt;ref name=Soppimath /&gt; Lipid nanoparticles can be manufactured by high pressure [[Homogenization (chemistry)|homogenization]], a current method used to produce [[parenteral]] [[emulsion]]s. This process can ultimately form a uniform dispersion of small droplets in a fluid substance by subdividing particles until the desired consistency is acquired.&lt;ref name=Blasi&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Blasi P, Schoubben A, Traina G, Manfroni G, Barberini L, Alberti PF, Cirotto C, Ricci M |title=Lipid nanoparticles for brain targeting III. Long-term stability and in vivo toxicity |journal=Int J Pharm |volume=454 |issue=1 |pages=316–23 |year=2013 |pmid=23832009 |doi=10.1016/j.ijpharm.2013.06.037 |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; This manufacturing process is already scaled and in use in the food industry, which therefore makes it more appealing for researchers and for the drug delivery industry.

Liposomes can also be functionalized by attaching various [[ligand]]s on the surface to enhance brain-targeted delivery.

=== Cationic liposomes ===
Another type of lipid-nanoparticle that can be used for drug delivery to the brain is a [[cationic liposome]]. These are lipid molecules that are positively charged.&lt;ref name= Masserini/&gt; One example of cationic liposomes uses [[bolaamphiphile]]s, which contain [[hydrophilic]] groups surrounding a [[hydrophobic]] chain to strengthen the boundary of the nano-vesicle containing the drug. Bolaamphiphile nano-vesicles can cross the BBB, and they allow controlled release of the drug to target sites.&lt;ref name= Hwang/&gt; [[Lipoplex]]es can also be formed from cationic liposomes and DNA solutions, to yield [[transfection]] agents.&lt;ref name = Masserini/&gt; Cationic liposomes cross the BBB through adsorption mediated endocytosis followed by [[internalization]] in the [[endosome]]s of the endothelial cells. By transfection of [[endothelium|endothelial cells]] through the use of lipoplexes, physical alterations in the cells could be made. These physical changes could potentially improve how some nanoparticle drug-carriers cross the BBB.

=== Solid lipid ===
[[File:SolidLipidNanoparticle.jpg|thumb|Diagram displays a solid lipid nanoparticle (SLN). There is only one phospholipid layer because the interior of the particle is solid. Molecules such as antibodies, targeting peptides, and drug molecules can be bound to the surface of the SLN.]]

Also, [[solid lipid nanoparticle]]s (SLNs) are lipid nanoparticles with a solid interior as shown in the diagram on the right. SLNs can be made by replacing the liquid lipid oil used in the emulsion process with a solid lipid. In solid lipid nanoparticles, the drug molecules are dissolved in the particle's solid [[hydrophobic]] lipid core, this is called the drug payload, and it is surrounded by an aqueous solution.&lt;ref name=Masserini/&gt; Many SLNs are developed from [[triglyceride]]s, [[fatty acid]]s, and [[wax]]es. High-pressure [[homogenization (chemistry)|homogenization]] or [[micro-emulsification]] can be used for manufacturing. Further, functionalizing the surface of solid lipid nanoparticles with [[polyethylene glycol]] (PEG) can result in increased BBB permeability.&lt;ref name=Amiji/&gt;

=== Nanoemulsions ===
Another form for nanoparticle delivery systems is oil-in-water [[emulsion]]s done on a nano-scale.&lt;ref name=Amiji/&gt; This process uses common [[biocompatible]] oils such as triglycerides and fatty acids, and combines them with water and surface-coating [[surfactant]]s. Oils rich in [[omega-3 fatty acid]]s especially contain important factors that aid in penetrating the [[tight junction]]s of the BBB.&lt;ref name=Amiji/&gt;

=== Polymer-based ===
Other nanoparticles are [[polymer]]-based, meaning they are made from a natural polymer such as [[polylactic acid]] (PLA), poly D,L-glycolide (PLG), polylactide-co-glycolide ([[PLGA]]),&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|title=Therapeutic Nanoparticles for Accumulation in the Brain|date=2016-02-12|url=https://patentscope.wipo.int/search/en/detail.jsf?docId=WO2016022462|inventor-last=Dhar|inventor2-last=Baker|inventor3-last=Marrache|inventor-first=Shanta|inventor2-first=Emily Wyatt|inventor3-first=Sean|issue=WO/2016/022462|accessdate=2017-04-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Marrache|first=Sean|last2=Pathak|first2=Rakesh K.|last3=Dhar|first3=Shanta|date=2014-07-22|title=Detouring of cisplatin to access mitochondrial genome for overcoming resistance|url=http://www.pnas.org/content/111/29/10444|journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences|language=en|volume=111|issue=29|pages=10444–10449|doi=10.1073/pnas.1405244111|issn=0027-8424|pmc=4115573|pmid=25002500}}&lt;/ref&gt; and poly[[cyanoacrylate]] (PCA).&lt;ref name=Soppimath&gt;{{cite journal|last=Soppimath|first=Kumaresh S.|author2=Aminabhavi, Tejraj M. |author3=Kulkarni, Anandrao R. |author4= Rudzinski, Walter E. |title=Biodegradable polymeric nanoparticles as drug delivery devices|journal=Journal of Controlled Release|year=2001|volume=70|issue=1–2|pages=1–20|doi=10.1016/S0168-3659(00)00339-4|pmid=11166403}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some studies have found that polymeric nanoparticles may provide better results for drug delivery relative to lipid-based nanoparticles because they may increase the stability of the drugs or proteins being transported. Polymeric nanoparticles may also contain beneficial [[controlled release]] mechanisms.

[[File:Polymer Branch.svg|thumb|left|Polymer Branch]]

Nanoparticles made from natural polymers that are biodegradable have the abilities to target specific organs and tissues in the body, to carry [[DNA]] for [[gene therapy]], and to deliver larger molecules such as [[protein]]s, [[peptide]]s, and even [[gene]]s.&lt;ref name=Soppimath/&gt; To manufacture these polymeric nanoparticles, the drug molecules are first dissolved and then [[Micro-encapsulation|encapsulated]] or attached to a polymer nanoparticle matrix. Three different structures can then be obtained from this process; nanoparticles, [[nanocapsule]]s (in which the drug is encapsulated and surrounded by the polymer matrix), and nanospheres (in which the drug is dispersed throughout the polymeric matrix in a spherical form).&lt;ref name=Soppimath/&gt;

One of the most important traits for nanoparticle delivery systems is that they must be biodegradable on the scale of a few days.&lt;ref name=Kreuter2/&gt; A few common polymer materials used for drug delivery studies are polybutyl [[cyanoacrylate]] (PBCA), poly(isohexyl cyanoacrylate) (PIHCA), [[polylactic acid]] (PLA), or polylactide-co-glycolide ([[PLGA]]). [[Human serum albumin]] (HSA) and [[chitosan]] are also materials of interest. PBCA undergoes degradation through [[proteolysis|enzymatic cleavage]] of its [[ester bond]] on the [[alkyl]] side chain to produce [[water-soluble]] byproducts. PBCA also proves to be the fastest biodegradable material, with studies showing 80% reduction after 24 hours post [[intravenous therapy]] injection.&lt;ref name=Kreuter2/&gt; PIHCA, however, was recently found to display an even lower degradation rate, which in turn further decreases [[toxicity]]. PIHCA, due to this slight advantage, is currently undergoing phase III clinical trials for transporting the drug doxorubicin as a treatment for [[hepatocellular carcinoma]]s.

Coating these polymeric nanoparticle devices with different surfactants can also aid BBB crossing and uptake in the brain. Surfactants such as polysorbate 80, 20, 40, 60, and [[poloxamer]] 188, demonstrated positive drug delivery through the blood–brain barrier, whereas other surfactants did not yield the same results.&lt;ref name=Kreuter2/&gt; It has also been shown that functionalizing the surface of nanoparticles with polyethylene glycol (PEG), can induce the "stealth effect", allowing the drug-loaded nanoparticle to circulate throughout the body for prolonged periods of time.&lt;ref name=Carstens&gt;{{cite book|last=Carstens|first=Myrra G.|title=Observations on the Disappearance of the Stealth Property of PEGylated Liposomes: Effects of Lipid Dose and Dosing Frequency|year=2006|publisher=Liposome Technology|pages=79–94|edition=3rd|author2=Romberg, Birgit |author3=Oussoren, Christien |author4=Storm, Gert |author5=Laverman, Peter |author6= Boerman, Otto C. |chapter=5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Further, the ''stealth effect'', caused in part by the hydrophilic and flexible properties of the PEG chains, facilitates an increase in localizing the drug at target sites in tissues and organs.&lt;ref name=Carstens/&gt;&lt;ref name=Salmaso&gt;{{cite journal|last=Salmaso|first=Stefano|author2=Caliceti, Paolo|title=Stealth Properties to Improve Therapeutic Efficacy of Drug Nanocarriers|journal=Journal of Drug Delivery|year=2013|volume=2013|doi=10.1155/2013/374252|pages=1–19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Mechanisms for delivery ==

=== Liposomes ===
A mechanism for liposome transport across the BBB is [[facilitated diffusion|lipid-mediated free diffusion]], a type of facilitated diffusion, or lipid-mediated [[endocytosis]].&lt;ref name=Amiji&gt;{{cite journal|last=Amiji|first=Mansoor|author2=Shah, Lipa |author3=Yadav, Sunita |title=Nanotechnology for CNS delivery of bio-therapeutic agents|journal=Drug Delivery and Translational Research|year=2013|volume=3|issue=4}}&lt;/ref&gt; There exist many [[lipoprotein]] receptors which bind lipoproteins to form complexes that in turn transport the liposome nano-delivery system across the BBB. [[Apolipoprotein]] E (apoE) is a protein that facilitates transport of lipids and cholesterol.&lt;ref name = Amiji/&gt; ApoE constituents bind to nanoparticles, and then this complex binds to a [[LDL receptor|low-density lipoprotein receptor]] (LDLR) in the BBB and allows transport to occur.

[[File:Blood-brain barrier transport en.png|thumb|This diagram shows several ways in which transport across the BBB works. For nanoparticle delivery across the BBB, the most common mechanisms are receptor-mediated transcytosis and adsorptive transcytosis]]

=== Polymeric nanoparticles ===
The mechanism for the transport of polymer-based nanoparticles across the BBB has been characterized as [[receptor-mediated endocytosis]] by the brain capillary endothelial cells.&lt;ref name = Kreuter2/&gt; [[Transcytosis]] then occurs to transport the nanoparticles across the tight junction of endothelial cells and into the brain. Surface coating nanoparticles with surfactants such as polysorbate 80 or poloxamer 188 was shown to increase uptake of the drug into the brain also.&lt;ref name = Kreuter2/&gt; This mechanism also relies on certain receptors located on the [[lumen (anatomy)|luminal]] surface of endothelial cells of the BBB.&lt;ref name=Masserini/&gt; [[Ligand]]s coated on the nanoparticle's surface bind to specific receptors to cause a conformational change. Once bound to these receptors, transcytosis can commence, and this involves the formation of vesicles from the [[plasma membrane]] pinching off the nanoparticle system after internalization.

Additional receptors identified for receptor-mediated endocytosis of nanoparticle delivery systems are the [[Scavenger receptor (immunology)|scavenger receptor]] class B type I (SR-BI), LDL receptor (LRP1), [[transferrin receptor]], and [[insulin receptor]].&lt;ref name=Kreuter2/&gt; As long as a receptor exists on the endothelial surface of the BBB, any ligand can be attached to the nanoparticle's surface to functionalize it so that it can bind and undergo endocytosis.

Another mechanism is ''adsorption mediated transcytosis'', where electrostatic interactions are involved in mediating nanoparticle crossing of the BBB.&lt;ref name= Masserini/&gt; Cationic nanoparticles (including cationic liposomes) are of interest for this mechanism, because their positive charges assist binding on the brain's endothelial cells. Using TAT-[[peptide]]s, a cell-penetrating peptide, to functionalize the surface of cationic nanoparticles can further improve drug transport into the brain.

=== Magnetic and Magnetoelectric nanoparticles ===
In contrast to the above mechanisms, a delivery with magnetic fields doesn't strongly depend on the biochemistry of the brain. In this case, nanoparticles are literally pulled across the BBB via application of a magnetic field gradient. The nanoparticles can be pulled in as well as removed from the brain merely by controlling the direction of the gradient. For the approach to work, the nanoparticles must have a non-zero magnetic moment and have a diameter of less than 50&amp;nbsp;nm. Both magnetic and magnetoelectric nanoparticles (MENs) satisfy the requirements. However, it is only the MENs which display a non-zero magnetoelectric (ME) effect.  Due to the ME effect, MENs can provide a direct access to local intrinsic electric fields at the nanoscale to enable a two-way communication with the neural network at the single-neuron level.&lt;ref&gt;Nair M, Guduru R, Liang P, Hong J, Sagar V, and Khizroev S (2013), “Externally-controlled on-demand release of anti-HIV drug AZTTP using magneto-electric nanoparticles as carriers”.

Nanomedicine (London) 10 (13), 2051-2061. doi: 10.2217/nnm.15.52&lt;/ref&gt; MENs, proposed by the research group of Professor Sakhrat Khizroev at Florida International University (FIU), have been used for targeted drug delivery and externally controlled release across the BBB to treat HIV and brain tumors, as well as to wirelessly stimulate neurons deep in the brain for treatment of neurodegenerative diseases such as Parkinson's Disease and others.

== Toxicity ==
A study was performed to assess the [[toxicity]] effects of doxorubicin-loaded polymeric nanoparticle systems.&lt;ref name=Kreuter2/&gt; It was found that doses up to 400&amp;nbsp;mg/kg of PBCA nanoparticles alone did not cause any toxic effects on the organism. These low toxicity effects can most likely be attributed to the controlled release and modified [[biodistribution]] of the drug due to the traits of the nanoparticle delivery system.&lt;ref name=Kreuter2/&gt; Toxicity is a highly important factor and limit of drug delivery studies, and a major area of interest in research on nanoparticle delivery to the brain.

== Research ==
In the early 21st century, extensive research is occurring in the field of nanoparticle drug delivery systems to the brain. One of the common diseases being studied in neuroscience today is Alzheimer's disease. Many studies have been done to show how nanoparticles can be used as a platform to deliver therapeutic drugs to these patients suffering from the disease. A few Alzheimer's drugs that have been studied especially are [[rivastigmine]], [[tacrine]], [[quinoline]], [[piperine]], and [[curcumin]].&lt;ref name=Kreuter2&gt;{{cite journal|last=Kreuter|first=Jörg|title=Drug delivery to the central nervous system by polymeric nanoparticles: What do we know?|journal=Advanced Drug Delivery Reviews|year=2013|volume=71|issue=|doi=10.1016/j.addr.2013.08.008|pages=2–14|pmid=23981489}}&lt;/ref&gt; PBCA, [[chitosan]], and PLGA nanoparticles were used as delivery systems for these drugs. Overall, the results from each drug injection with these nanoparticles showed remarkable improvements in the effects of the drug relative to non-nanoparticle delivery systems. This possibly suggests that nanoparticles could provide a promising solution to how these drugs could cross the BBB. One factor that still must be considered and accounted for is nanoparticle accumulation in the body. With long-term and frequent injections that are often required to treat [[Chronic (medicine)|chronic diseases]] such as Alzheimer's disease, polymeric nanoparticles could potentially build up in the body, causing undesirable effects. This area for concern would have to be further assessed to analyze these possible effects and to improve them.&lt;ref name=Kreuter2/&gt;

'''National Green Corps''' is a programme of the [[Ministry of Environment and Forests]] of [[Government of India]] covering around 1,20,000 schools in [[India]] with [[NGC School Eco Clubs]]. Environmental activity in schools in India is promoted through the National Green Corps. Each NGC School Eco Club has 30 to 50 NGC Students or NGC Cadets who form the National Green Corps. These NGC Students participate in activities related to [[Biodiversity conservation|Biodiversity Conservation]], [[Water conservation|Water Conservation]], [[Energy conservation|Energy Conservation]], [[Waste management|Waste Management]] and [[Land use planning|Land Use Planning]] and [[Resource management|Resource Management]]. Locale specific issues are focused by the NGC Eco Clubs. When young girls and boys from NGC take up the [[environmental awareness]] activities and [[outreach]] activities, they attract huge public attention which eventually becomes public support for an environmental cause or environmental intervention. Water Harvesting, Plantation, [[Composting]] of [[biodegradable waste]] are most popular activities in the NGC School Eco Clubs. These NGC School Eco Clubs promote [[environmental discipline]] and [[environmental responsibility]] through the selected schools in India using environmental awareness as the medium. Each of the 250 districts in India has about 250 NGC Eco Clubs. These NGC Eco Clubs are provided with an annual grant of Rs2500. Each of the Indian State has a State Nodal Officer who implements this programme.

The NGC Children are making a huge impact in the country. [[Telangana]], [[Andhra Pradesh]], [[Gujarat]], [[Maharashtra]], [[Orissa, India|Orissa]], [[Kerala]], [[Punjab (India)|Punjab]], [[Jammu and Kashmir]], [[Assam]], [[Chhattisgarh]], [[Madhya Pradesh]] and [[Tamil Nadu]] are some of the states where this programme is making huge impact on the society. Telangana and Andhra Pradesh have a separate Directorates for conducting this programme, while all other states conduct this programme through one of those organisations which is interested in environmental awareness and [[Conservation (ethic)|conservation]] aspects. Telangana has much more involvement than any other state. They even own a [http://www.ngc.ap.gov.in/ website]. In Telangana and Andhra Pradesh, Sikkim, Delhi and Himachal Pradesh the eco-club schools participate in the Green Schools Programme conducted by the Environment Education Unit of the [[Centre for Science and Environment]]. The eco-club schools that win awards at the state level go on to compete for the National Awards organised by Centre for Science and Environment (CSE) in Delhi.

Since school children are involved, most of the activities of National Green Corps children are linked to the culture and cultural aspects of conservation of [[natural resource]]s and [[Natural environment|environment]]. There are Master Trainers trained by the State Nodal Agencies with the help of the State Resource Agencies who train the Teachers-In-Charge of the NGC Eco Clubs.Each district has the District Implementation and Monitoring Committee which is supported by the District Coordinator, while at the state level the State Nodal Officer is guided by the state level Committee.

This is the largest such programme anywhere in the world. When these trained NGC Students grow up and take the environmental challenges of this second the most populous country, it is expected that there will be huge difference made to the way the resources are consumed and conserved. Andhra Pradesh is trying to groom the NGC Cadets as an environmentally disciplined force. It has introduced Uniform and Band along with a structured programme of formation of five teams of [[cadet]]s exclusively in all NGC School Eco Clubs. These NGC Cadets are the Green Brigade of the school, protecting the natural resources from misuse and promoting the conservation of the natural resources. These NGC Cadets are getting the pride place during the National Days when they participate in full NGC Uniform during the ceremonial parades along with other uniformed forces of the country.

The first ever National Conference of National Green Corps Eco Clubs is at [[Hyderabad, India|Hyderabad]] from 26 to 29 August 2010.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3810">In [[programming language theory]], a '''non-local variable''' is a variable that is not defined in the local scope. While the term can refer to global variables, it is primarily used in the context of [[nested function|nested]] and [[anonymous function]]s where some variables can be neither in the [[local scope|local]] nor the [[global scope]].

In [[Lua (programming language)|Lua]] they are called the ''upvalues'' of the function.&lt;ref&gt;''[http://www.lua.org/pil/contents.html  Programming in Lua (first edition)],'' "[http://www.lua.org/pil/27.3.3.html 27.3.3 – Upvalues]"&lt;/ref&gt;

== Examples == &lt;!-- Please do NOT add the same example in other languages to this article. These examples suffice to get the point across. Wikipedia is not a source code repository. --&gt;
=== Nested functions === &lt;!-- Please do NOT add the same example in other languages to this article. These two examples  suffice to get the point across. Wikipedia is not a source code repository. --&gt;
In the Python 3 example that follows there is a nested function &lt;code&gt;inner&lt;/code&gt; defined in the scope of another function &lt;code&gt;outer&lt;/code&gt;. The variable &lt;code&gt;x&lt;/code&gt; is local to &lt;code&gt;outer&lt;/code&gt;, but non-local to &lt;code&gt;inner&lt;/code&gt; (nor is it global):
&lt;source lang=python3&gt;
def outer():
    x = 1
    def inner():
        nonlocal x
        x += 1
        print(x)
    return inner
&lt;/source&gt;

In Javascript, the locality of a variable is determined by the closest &lt;code&gt;var&lt;/code&gt; statement for this variable. In the following example, &lt;code&gt;x&lt;/code&gt; is local to &lt;code&gt;outer&lt;/code&gt; as it contains a &lt;code&gt; var x&lt;/code&gt; statement, while &lt;code&gt;inner&lt;/code&gt; doesn't. Therefore, x is non-local to &lt;code&gt;inner&lt;/code&gt;:
&lt;source lang=javascript&gt;
function outer() {
    var x = 1;
    function inner() {
        x += 1;
        console.log(x);
    }
    return inner;
}
&lt;/source&gt;

=== Anonymous functions === &lt;!-- Please do NOT add the same example in other languages to this article. These examples suffice to get the point across. Wikipedia is not a source code repository. --&gt;
In the Haskell example that follows the variable &lt;code&gt;c&lt;/code&gt; is non-local in the anonymous function &lt;code&gt;\x -&gt; x + c&lt;/code&gt;:
&lt;source lang=haskell&gt;
outer = let c = 1 in map (\x -&gt; x + c) [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
&lt;/source&gt;

== Implementation issues ==
{{see also|Nested function#Implementation|Man or boy test}}
Non-local variables are the primary reason it is difficult to support nested, anonymous, [[higher-order function|higher-order]] and thereby [[first-class function]]s in a programming language.

If the nested function or functions are (mutually) [[Recursion (computer science)|recursive]], it becomes hard for the [[compiler]] to know exactly where on the [[call stack]] the non-local variable was allocated, as the [[frame pointer]] only points to the local variable of the nested function itself and there can be an arbitrary number of [[activation record]]s on the stack in between. This is generally solved using [[access link]]s or [[display register]]s.

If the nested function is passed as an argument to a higher-order function a [[closure (computer science)|closure]] needs to be built in order to locate the non-local variables. If the nested function is returned as a result from its outer function (or stored in a variable) the non-local variables will no longer be available on the stack. They need to be heap allocated instead, and their lifetime extend beyond the lifetime of the outer function that declared and allocated them. This generally requires garbage-collection.

{{Punctuation marks|※|caption=reference mark}}

A '''note''' is a string of text placed at the bottom of a [[page (paper)|page]] in a book or document or at the end of a chapter, volume or the whole text.  The note can provide an author's comments on the main text or [[citation]]s of a reference work in support of the text, or both.

'''Footnotes''' are notes at the foot of the page while '''endnotes''' are collected under a separate heading at the end of a chapter, volume, or entire work.  Unlike footnotes, endnotes have the advantage of not affecting the layout of the main text, but may cause inconvenience to readers who have to move back and forth between the main text and the endnotes.

In some editions of the Bible, notes are placed in a narrow column in the middle of each page between two columns of biblical text.

== Numbering and symbols==

In English, a footnote is normally flagged by a [[superscript]]ed number immediately following that portion of the text the note references, each such footnote being numbered sequentially. Occasionally a number between brackets or parentheses is used instead, thus: [1], which can also be superscripted, as in Wikipedia's own citation style rendered within this very page.

Typographical devices such as the [[asterisk]] (*) or [[dagger (typography)|dagger]] (†) may also be used to point to footnotes; the traditional order of these symbols in English is [[Asterisk|*]], [[Dagger (typography)|†]], [[Double dagger (typography)|‡]], [[Section sign|§]], [[Vertical Bar|‖]], [[Pilcrow|¶]].&lt;ref&gt;Robert Bringhurst (2005).  ''The Elements of Typographic Style'' (version 3.1).  Point Roberts, WA: Hartley and Marks. pp 68–69.  Bringhurst goes on to say “But beyond the ... double dagger, this order is not familiar to most readers, and never was.”&lt;/ref&gt;  Other symbols, including the [[Number Sign|#]], [[Delta (letter)|Δ]], [[Lozenge|◊]], [[Arrow (symbol)|↓]], and [[Index (typography)|☞]], have also been used.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.livesandletters.ac.uk/papers/FOR_2005_04_001.pdf|author=William H. Sherman|title=Toward a History of the Manicule|accessdate=2013-06-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Many of these symbols are used, for example, in [[John Bach McMaster]], ''History of the People of the United States''&lt;/ref&gt; In documents like [[Public transport timetable|timetables]], many different symbols, letters and numbers may be used to refer the reader to particular notes.

== Academic usage==
Notes are most often used as an alternative to long explanatory notes that can be distracting to readers. Most literary style guidelines (including the [[Modern Language Association]] and the [[American Psychological Association]]) recommend limited use of foot and endnotes. However, publishers often encourage note references in lieu of parenthetical references. Aside from use as a bibliographic element, notes are used for additional information or explanatory notes that might be too digressive for the main text. Footnotes are heavily utilized in academic institutions to support claims made in academic essays covering myriads of topics.

In particular, footnotes are the normal form of citation in historical journals. This is due, firstly, to the fact that the most important references are often to archive sources or interviews which do not readily fit standard formats, and secondly, to the fact that historians expect to see the exact nature of the evidence which is being used at each stage.

The MLA (Modern Language Association) requires the superscript numbers in the main text to be placed following the punctuation in the phrase or clause the note is in reference to. The exception to this rule occurs when a sentence contains a dash, in which case the superscript would precede it.{{Citation needed|date=November 2014}}

Aside from their technical use, authors use notes for a variety of reasons:
* As signposts to direct the reader to information the author has provided or where further useful information is pertaining to the subject in the main text.
* To attribute a quote or viewpoint.
* As an alternative to parenthetical references; it is a simpler way to acknowledge information gained from another source.
* To escape the limitations imposed on the [[word count]] of various academic and legal texts which do not take into account notes. Aggressive use of this strategy can lead to a text affected by "foot and note disease" (a derogation coined by [[John Betjeman]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Rogers|first=Timothy|title=Rupert Brooke: Man and Monument|journal=English|year=1968|volume=17|issue=99|pages=79–84|url=http://english.oxfordjournals.org/content/17/99/79.full.pdf|accessdate=21 March 2011|doi=10.1093/english/17.99.79}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;

''The Independent'', Thursday 27 April 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Government documents==
The [[US Government Printing Office]] Style Manual devotes over 660 words to the topic of footnotes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Chapter 15: Footnotes, indexes, contents, and outlines | work=U.S. Government Printing Office Style Manual | url=http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/GPO-STYLEMANUAL-2008/html/GPO-STYLEMANUAL-2008-17.htm | accessdate=October 26, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[NASA]] has guidance for footnote usage in its historical documents.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=A Guide to Footnotes and Endnotes for NASA History Authors | work=NASA History Style Guide | url=https://history.nasa.gov/footnoteguide.html | accessdate=March 24, 2005 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legal writing==
Associate Justice [[Stephen Breyer]] of the [[Supreme Court of the United States]] is famous in the American legal community for his writing style, in which he never uses notes. He prefers to keep all citations within the text (which is permitted in American legal citation).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | first= | last= | coauthors= | title=In Justice Breyer's Opinion, A Footnote Has No Place | date=1995-07-28 | publisher= | url =https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=990CE1DC163EF93BA15754C0A963958260 | work =[[The New York Times]] | pages = | accessdate = 2008-04-30 | language = }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Richard A. Posner]] has also written against the use of notes in judicial opinions.&lt;ref name=Posner2001&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Posner|first1=Richard A.|title=Against Footnotes|journal=Court Review|date=Summer 2001|url=http://aja.ncsc.dni.us/courtrv/cr38-2/CR38-2Posner.pdf|accessdate=2014-10-13|publisher=American Judges Association}}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Bryan A. Garner]], however, advocates using notes instead of inline citations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Oddi |first=Marcia |url=http://indianalawblog.com/archives/2005/01/indiana_courts_99.html |title=Indiana Courts - Footnotes in Judicial Opinions |publisher=The Indiana Law Blog |date=2005-01-07 |accessdate=2015-11-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==HTML==
[[HTML]], the predominant [[markup language]] for web pages, has no mechanism for marking up notes. Despite a number of different proposals over the years, and repeated pleas from the user base, the [[working group]] has been unable to reach a consensus on it. Because of this, [[MediaWiki]], for example, has had to introduce its own &lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt; tag for citing references in notes, an idea which has since also been implemented for generic use by the ''[[Nelson (HTML preprocessor)|Nelson]]'' HTML preprocessor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Nelson HTML Preprocessor | url=http://nelsonhtml.com | accessdate=2009-06-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It might be argued that the [[hyperlink]] partially eliminates the need for notes, being the web's way to refer to another document. However, it does not allow citing to offline sources and if the destination of the link changes, the link can become dead or irrelevant.&lt;ref&gt;[[Jill Lepore]]. "[https://web.archive.org/web/20150125141230/http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/01/26/cobweb The Cobweb]", ''[[The New Yorker]]'', 26 January 2015 issue. Retrieved 25 January 2015. Archived from [http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/01/26/cobweb the original].&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The sign is historically equal to the [[asterisks]] used by [[Aristarchus of Samothrace]] at the [[Musaeum|Mouseion at Alexandria]]. It was used for the critical editions of Homer's writings where it "marked a verse incorrectly repeated in another passage" and was used together with other signs such as the [[obelus]].&lt;ref&gt;L.D. Reynolds and N.G. Wilson. Scribes and Scholars: A guide to the Transmission of Greek and Latin Literature. Oxford University Press, 1991, 3rd edition, {{ISBN|0-19-872146-3}}, p. 10-11&lt;/ref&gt;

The London printer [[Richard Jugge]] is generally credited as the inventor of the footnote, first used in the [[Bishops' Bible]] of 1568.&lt;ref&gt;Chuck Zerby, ''The Devil's Details: A History of Footnotes'', 2007, {{ISBN|1931229058}}, p. 28 and ''passim''&lt;/ref&gt;

Early printings of the Douay Bible used two closely spaced colons (actually squared four dot punctuation mark U+2E2C) to indicate a marginal note.

==Literary device==
At times, notes have been used for their comical effect, or as a literary device.

* [[James Joyce]]'s ''[[Finnegans Wake]]'' uses footnotes along with left and right marginal notes in Book II Chapter 2. The three types of notes represent comments from the three siblings doing their homework: Shem, Shaun, and Issy.
* [[J.G. Ballard]]'s  "Notes Towards a Mental Breakdown," is one sentence ("A discharged Broadmoor patient compiles 'Notes Towards a Mental Breakdown,' recalling his wife's murder, his trial and exoneration.") and a series of elaborate footnotes to each one of the words.
*[[Mark Z. Danielewski]]'s ''[[House of Leaves]]'' uses what are arguably some of the most extensive and intricate footnotes in literature. Throughout the novel, footnotes are used to tell several different narratives outside of the main story. The physical orientation of the footnotes on the page also works to reflect the twisted feeling of the plot (often taking up several pages, appearing mirrored from page to page, vertical on either side of the page, or in boxes in the center of the page, in the middle of the central narrative).
* [[Flann O'Brien]]'s ''[[The Third Policeman]]'' utilizes extensive and lengthy footnotes for the discussion of a fictional philosopher, [[de Selby]]. These footnotes span several pages and often overtake the main plotline, and add to the absurdist tone of the book.
* [[David Foster Wallace]]'s ''[[Infinite Jest]]'' includes over 400 endnotes, some over a dozen pages long. Several literary critics suggested that the book be read with two bookmarks.  Wallace uses footnotes, endnotes, and in-text notes in much of his other writing as well.
*[[Manuel Puig]]'s ''Kiss of the Spider Woman'' (originally published in Spanish as ''El beso de la mujer araña'') also makes extensive use of footnotes.
*[[Garrison Keillor]]'s ''[[Lake Wobegon Days]]'' includes lengthy footnotes and a parallel narrative.
*[[Mark Dunn]]'s ''[[Ibid: A Life]]'' is written entirely in endnotes.
*[[Luis d'Antin van Rooten]]'s ''[[Mots d'Heures: Gousses, Rames]]'' (the title is in [[French language|French]], but when pronounced, sounds similar to the [[English language|English]] ''"Mother Goose Rhymes"''), in which he is allegedly the editor of a manuscript by the fictional François Charles Fernand d’Antin, contains copious footnotes purporting to help explain the nonsensical French text. The point of the book is that each written French poem ''sounds'' like an English [[nursery rhyme]].
*[[Terry Pratchett]] has made numerous uses within his novels. The footnotes will often set up running jokes for the rest of the novel.
*[[B.L.A.]] and [[G.B. Gabbler]]'s meta novel ''[[The Automation]]'' makes uses of footnotes to break the [[fourth wall]]. The narrator of the novel, known as "B.L.A.," tells the fantastical story as if true, while the editor, Gabbler, annotates the story through footnotes and thinks the manuscript is only a [[prose poem]] attempting to be a literary masterwork.
*[[Susanna Clarke]]'s ''[[Jonathan Strange &amp; Mr Norrell]]'' uses dozens of footnotes referencing a number of fictional books including magical scholarship and biographies.

*[[Ernest Hemingway]]'s ''[[Natural History of the Dead]]'' uses a footnote to further satirize the style of a history while making a sardonic statement about the extinction of "humanists" in modern society.
*[[Pierre Bayle]]'s ''[[Dictionnaire Historique et Critique|Historical and Critical Dictionary]]'' follows each brief entry with a footnote (often five or six times the length of the main text) in which saints, historical figures, and other topics are used as examples for philosophical digression.  The separate footnotes are designed to contradict each other, and only when multiple footnotes are read together is Bayle's core argument for [[Fideism|Fideistic skepticism]] revealed.  This technique was used in part to evade the harsh censorship of 17th century France.
*[[Mordecai Richler]]'s novel ''[[Barney's Version (novel)|Barney's Version]]'' uses footnotes as a character device that highlights unreliable passages in the narration.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4064">'''On Line Opinion''', or Online Opinion, is an [[open access]] [[electronic journal]], specialising in social and political debate. The journal is published in Australia, although content is not necessarily limited to Australian issues, and extends at times to publication in wider areas, such as, religion, ethics, and philosophy.

== History ==

On Line Opinion was established in 1999 by political commentator Graham Young.&lt;ref name="Flew&amp;Young"&gt;Flew, T. and G. Young. 2004. [http://eprints.qut.edu.au/393/ 'If they come they will build it: Managing and building e-democracy from the ground up']. ''Proceedings of the Australian Electronic Governance Conference''.&lt;/ref&gt; Since then, On Line Opinion has become recognized as one of the leading examples of [[alternative journalism]]&lt;ref&gt;Forde, S. 2011.

Basingstoke: [[Palgrave Higher Education]]. {{ISBN|978-0230243569}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[citizen journalism]].&lt;ref&gt;Taylor, A. and J. Cokley. 2013.

Vol.13, No.2.&lt;/ref&gt; In 2012, the report of the Independent Inquiry into Media and Media Regulation by the Hon [[Raymond Antony Finkelstein]] QC stated that: "While the start-up costs for new print publications have been prohibitive and inhibited new enterprises emerging, the streamlining of the relationship between content producers and consumers has led to many new websites and web-based services. Among the most important such websites that have grown up in Australia over the last decade are ''[[Inside Story (Australian TV program)|Inside Story]]'', ''[[Australian Policy Online]]'', Online Opinion, ''[[The Drum (TV program)|The Drum]]'', ''[[The Conversation (website)|The Conversation]]'', and [[New Matilda]]."&lt;ref&gt;Finkelstein, R. March 2012. [http://www.abc.net.au/mediawatch/transcripts/1205_finkelstein.pdf Report of the Independent Inquiry into the Media and Media Regulation]. Retrieved 19/2/16.&lt;/ref&gt; The journal is referenced by the [[Australian National Library]],&lt;ref&gt;Australian National Library Catalogue: See http://catalogue.nla.gov.au/Record/4395745.&lt;/ref&gt; with {{ISSN|1442-8458}}.&lt;ref&gt;Australian Public Affairs Information Service, [http://www.nla.gov.au/apais/jourandconf.html Electronic Journals and Conferences]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Purpose ==

On Line Opinion was founded as an experiment in [[participatory democracy]], through the means of [[participatory journalism]].&lt;ref name="Flew&amp;Young"/&gt; The contributors to On Line Opinion constitute a wide range of writers, such as what might be described as high-profile contributors, including politicians and academics, and what might be called ordinary citizens, that is, those with no particular public profile.&lt;ref&gt;See list of authors at: http://www.onlineopinion.com.au/author.asp&lt;/ref&gt; One of the motivations behind On Line Opinion was to address the limitations of [[academic publishing]], and thus On Line Opinion aims to publish accessible material, sometimes called [[grey literature]], on a more timely basis and with a wider audience, than would otherwise be the case. Research has suggested that, in comparative terms, publication within On Line Opinion is indeed more timely than is the case with other citizen journals, with on average five new articles per day appearing on the website.&lt;ref&gt;Taylor, A. and J. Cokley. 2013. [http://ejournalist.com.au/v13n2/TaylorCokley.pdf 'How citizen journalism websites are working in Australia: news and discussion']. ''Ejournalist: a Refereed Media Journal''.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3868">[[File:Passive radiator enclosure.svg|thumb|right|100px|Passive radiator enclosure with front mounted passive radiator; back or side mounting is also used]]
A [[Loudspeaker enclosure|speaker enclosure]] using a '''[[Passivity (engineering)|passive]] radiator''' (PR) usually contains an "active  [[loudspeaker]]" (or main driver), and a passive radiator (also known as a "drone cone"). The active loudspeaker is a normal driver, and the passive radiator is of similar construction, but without a [[voice coil]] and [[Loudspeaker#Driver design|magnet assembly]]. It is not attached to a voice coil or wired to an electrical circuit or [[power amplifier]]. 
[[File:Logitech Z4 satellite 1.jpg|thumb|right|200px|A small Logitech computer speaker cabinet. The middle speaker is a real loudspeaker. The top and bottom cones are passive radiators.]]

In the same way as a ported loudspeaker, a passive radiator system uses the sound otherwise trapped in the enclosure to excite a resonance that makes it easier for the speaker system to create the deepest pitches (e.g., [[bassline]]s). The passive radiator resonates at a frequency determined by its mass and the springiness of the air in the enclosure. It is tuned to the specific enclosure by varying its [[mass]] (e.g., by adding weight to the cone). Internal air pressure produced by movements of the active driver cone moves the passive radiator cone.&lt;ref&gt;http://audiojudgement.com/passive-radiator-speaker-design/ &lt;/ref&gt; This resonance simultaneously reduces the amount that the woofer has to move.

==Design considerations==
Passive radiators (PR's) are used instead of a [[reflex port]] for several reasons. In small volume enclosures tuned to low frequencies, the length of the required port becomes very large.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.subwoofer-builder.com/passive.htm &lt;/ref&gt; They are also used to reduce or eliminate the objectionable noises of port turbulence and compressive flow caused by high velocity airflow in small ports. In addition, ports have pipe resonances that can produce undesired effects on frequency response.

Passive radiators are tuned by mass variations (M&lt;sub&gt;mp&lt;/sub&gt;), changing the way their compliance interacts with motion of the air in the box. The weight of the cone of the passive radiator should be approximately equivalent to the mass of the air that would have filled the port which might have been used for that design.{{Citation needed|date=September 2018}}

The frequency response of a passive radiator will be similar to that of a ported cabinet, but the system low frequency roll-off will be slightly steeper due to a [[Band-stop filter|notch]] (dip) in [[frequency response]] caused by the V&lt;sub&gt;ap&lt;/sub&gt; (compliance or stiffness) of the passive radiator.  This notch occurs at the PR's free-air resonant frequency and causes slightly poorer transient response.  Despite this, perhaps due to the lack of vent turbulence and vent pipe resonances, many prefer the sound of PRs to reflex ports. PR speakers are only slightly more complex to design and are generally more expensive as compared to standard bass reflex enclosures.

==Applications==
Passive radiators are used in [[Bluetooth]] Speakers ([[JBL]] uses the technology in their whole lineup excluding their voice-activated speakers and the Clip series), [[home stereo]] speakers, [[subwoofer]] cabinets and [[car audio]] speaker systems, particularly in cases where there is not enough space for a port or vent system. While most [[studio monitor speaker]]s are either ported bass reflex designs, or closed-back without a vent or passive radiator, [[Mackie]]'s HR824 and HR624 monitor speakers have a passive radiator installed on the rear of the cabinet. Focal also sells a studio monitor with a passive radiator called the SM9.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7931">A '''pitch detection algorithm (PDA)''' is an [[algorithm]] designed to estimate the [[pitch (music)|pitch]] or [[fundamental frequency]] of a [[quasiperiodic]] or [[oscillation|oscillating]] signal, usually a [[digital recording]] of [[speech processing|speech]] or a musical note or tone. This can be done in the [[time domain]], the [[frequency domain]], or both.

PDAs are used in various contexts (e.g. [[phonetics]], [[music information retrieval]], [[speech coding]], [[musical performance system]]s) and so there may be different demands placed upon the algorithm. There is as yet{{When|date=October 2018}} no single ideal PDA, so a variety of algorithms exist, most falling broadly into the classes given below.&lt;ref&gt;D. Gerhard. [http://www.cs.uregina.ca/Research/Techreports/2003-06.pdf Pitch Extraction and Fundamental Frequency: History and Current Techniques], technical report, Dept. of Computer Science, University of Regina, 2003.&lt;/ref&gt;

A PDA typically estimates the period of a quasiperiodic signal, then inverts that value to give the frequency.

One simple approach would be to measure the distance between [[zero crossing]] points of the signal (i.e. the [[zero-crossing rate]]). However, this does not work well with complicated [[waveform]]s which are composed of multiple sine waves with differing periods or noisy data. Nevertheless, there are cases in which zero-crossing can be a useful measure, e.g. in some speech applications where a single source is assumed.{{Cn|date=October 2018}} The algorithm's simplicity makes it "cheap" to implement.

More sophisticated approaches compare segments of the signal with other segments offset by a trial period to find a match. AMDF ([[average magnitude difference function]]), ASMDF (Average Squared Mean Difference Function), and other similar [[autocorrelation]] algorithms work this way. These algorithms can give quite accurate results for highly periodic signals. However, they have false detection problems (often "''octave errors''"), can sometimes cope badly with noisy signals (depending on the implementation), and - in their basic implementations - do not deal well with [[polyphony|polyphonic]] sounds (which involve multiple musical notes of different pitches).{{Cn|date=October 2018}} 

Current{{When|date=October 2018}} time-domain pitch detector algorithms tend to build upon the basic methods mentioned above, with additional refinements to bring the performance more in line with a human assessment of pitch. For example, the YIN algorithm&lt;ref&gt;A. de Cheveigné and H. Kawahara. [http://www.ircam.fr/pcm/cheveign/pss/2002_JASA_YIN.pdf YIN, a fundamental frequency estimator for speech and music.]{{dead link|date=March 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} The Journal of the Acoustical Society of America, 111:1917, 2002. {{doi|10.1121/1.1458024}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the MPM algorithm&lt;ref&gt;P. McLeod and G. Wyvill. [http://www.cs.otago.ac.nz/tartini/papers/A_Smarter_Way_to_Find_Pitch.pdf A smarter way to find pitch.] In Proceedings of the International Computer Music Conference (ICMC’05), 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; are both based upon [[autocorrelation]].

==Frequency-domain approaches==
Frequency domain, polyphonic detection is possible, usually utilizing the [[periodogram]] to convert the signal to an estimate of the [[frequency spectrum]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Statistical Digital Signal Processing and Modeling |last=Hayes |first=Monson |year=1996 |publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc. |isbn=0-471-59431-8 |page=393}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
. This requires more processing power as the desired accuracy increases, although the well-known efficiency of the [[Fast Fourier transform|FFT]], a key part of the [[periodogram]] algorithm, makes it suitably efficient for many purposes.

Popular frequency domain algorithms include: the [[harmonic product spectrum]];&lt;ref name="cnxpda"&gt;[http://cnx.org/content/m11714/latest/ Pitch Detection Algorithms], online resource from [[OpenStax CNX|Connexions]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;A. Michael Noll, “Pitch Determination of Human Speech by the Harmonic Product Spectrum, the Harmonic Sum Spectrum and a Maximum Likelihood Estimate,” Proceedings of the Symposium on Computer Processing in Communications, Vol. XIX, Polytechnic Press: Brooklyn, New York,  (1970), pp. 779-797.&lt;/ref&gt; [[cepstrum|cepstral]] analysis&lt;ref&gt;A. Michael Noll, “Cepstrum Pitch Determination,” Journal of the Acoustical Society of America, Vol. 41, No. 2, (February 1967), pp. 293-309.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[maximum likelihood]] which attempts to match the frequency domain characteristics to pre-defined frequency maps (useful for detecting pitch of fixed tuning instruments); and the detection of peaks due to harmonic series.&lt;ref&gt;Mitre, Adriano; Queiroz, Marcelo; Faria, Régis. [http://www.ime.usp.br/~mqz/Mitre_AESBR2006.pdf Accurate and Efficient Fundamental Frequency Determination from Precise Partial Estimates.] Proceedings of the 4th AES Brazil Conference. 113-118, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

To improve on the pitch estimate derived from the discrete Fourier spectrum, techniques such as [[Reassignment method|spectral reassignment]] (phase based) or [[Grandke interpolation]] (magnitude based) can be used to go beyond the precision provided by the FFT bins.  Another phase-based approach is offered by Brown and Puckette &lt;ref&gt;Brown JC and Puckette MS (1993).  A high resolution fundamental frequency determination based on phase changes of the Fourier transform.  J. Acoust. Soc. Am. Volume 94, Issue 2, pp. 662-667 [https://archive.is/20130414073448/http://asadl.org/jasa/resource/1/jasman/v94/i2/p662_s1?isAuthorized=no ]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Spectral/temporal approaches==
Spectral/temporal pitch detection algorithms, e.g. the YAAPT pitch tracking,&lt;ref&gt;Stephen A. Zahorian and Hongbing Hu. [http://bingweb.binghamton.edu/~hhu1/paper/Zahorian2008spectral.pdf A Spectral/temporal method for Robust Fundamental Frequency Tracking.] The Journal of the Acoustical Society of America, 123 (6), 2008. {{doi|10.1121/1.2916590}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Stephen A. Zahorian and Hongbing Hu. [http://ws2.binghamton.edu/zahorian/yaapt.htm YAAPT Pitch Tracking MATLAB Function]&lt;/ref&gt; are based upon a combination of time domain processing using an [[autocorrelation]] function such as normalized cross correlation, and frequency domain processing utilizing spectral information to identify the pitch. Then, among the candidates estimated from the two domains, a final pitch track can be computed using [[dynamic programming]]. The advantage of these approaches is that the tracking error in one domain can be reduced by the process in the other domain.

==Fundamental frequency of speech==
The fundamental frequency of [[speech]] can vary from 40&amp;nbsp;Hz for low-pitched male voices to 600&amp;nbsp;Hz for children or high-pitched female voices.&lt;ref name=huang&gt;{{cite book |last=Huang |first=Xuedong |author2=Alex Acero |author3=Hsiao-Wuen Hon |title=Spoken Language Processing |year=2001 |publisher=Prentice Hall PTR |isbn=0-13-022616-5 |page=325 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Autocorrelation methods need at least two pitch periods to detect pitch. This means that in order to detect a fundamental frequency of 40&amp;nbsp;Hz, at least 50 milliseconds (ms) of the speech signal must be analyzed. However, during 50 ms, speech with higher fundamental frequencies may not necessarily have the same fundamental frequency throughout the window.&lt;ref name=huang/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="27737">{{short description|A treatment process for wastewater or sewage}}
'''Secondary treatment''' is a treatment process for [[wastewater]] (or [[sewage]]) to achieve a certain degree of effluent quality by using a [[sewage treatment plant]] with physical phase separation to remove [[settleable solids]] and a biological process to remove dissolved and suspended organic compounds. After this kind of treatment, the wastewater may be called as secondary-treated wastewater.

Secondary treatment is the portion of a sewage treatment sequence removing dissolved and [[colloid]]al compounds measured as [[biochemical oxygen demand]] (BOD).  Secondary treatment is traditionally applied to the liquid portion of sewage after primary treatment has removed settleable solids and floating material. Secondary treatment is typically performed by [[Indigenous (ecology)|indigenous]], aquatic [[microorganism]]s in a managed [[Aerobic organism|aerobic]] habitat. [[Bacteria]] and [[protozoa]] consume biodegradable soluble organic contaminants (e.g. [[sugar]]s, fats, and organic short-chain [[carbon]] molecules from human waste, food waste, soaps and detergent) while reproducing to form [[cell (biology)|cell]]s of biological solids. Biological oxidation processes are sensitive to temperature and, between 0&amp;nbsp;°C and 40&amp;nbsp;°C, the rate of biological reactions increase with temperature. Most surface aerated vessels operate at between 4&amp;nbsp;°C and 32&amp;nbsp;°C.&lt;ref name="Basin" /&gt;
[[File:Secondary sedimentation tank 1 w.JPG|thumb|This small secondary [[clarifier]] at a rural sewage treatment plant is a typical phase separation mechanism to remove biological solids formed in a suspended growth or fixed-film bioreactor.]]

==Definitions==

=== Primary treatment ===
Primary treatment of sewage by quiescent settling allows separation of floating material and heavy solids from liquid waste. The remaining liquid usually contains less than half of the original solids content and approximately two-thirds of the BOD in the form of colloids and dissolved organic compounds.&lt;ref&gt;Abbett, p.19-28&lt;/ref&gt; Where nearby water bodies can rapidly dilute this liquid waste, primary treated sewage may be discharged so natural biological decomposition oxidizes remaining waste.&lt;ref&gt;Abbett, p.19-20&lt;/ref&gt;

The city of [[San Diego]] used Pacific Ocean dilution of primary treated effluent into the 21st century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sandiego.gov/mwwd/facilities/ptloma/ |title=Point Loma Wastewater Treatment Plant |last= |first= |website= |publisher=City of San Diego |accessdate=5 January 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Secondary treatment ===
The [[United States Environmental Protection Agency]] (EPA) defined secondary treatment based on the performance observed at late 20th-century bioreactors treating typical United States municipal sewage.&lt;ref name="EPA-reg"&gt;U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), Washington, D.C. "Secondary Treatment Regulation: Secondary treatment." {{CodeFedReg|40|133|102}} ''Code of Federal Regulations.'' 1984-10-16.&lt;/ref&gt; Secondary treated sewage is expected to produce effluent with a monthly average of less than 30&amp;nbsp;mg/l BOD and less than 30&amp;nbsp;mg/l [[suspended solids]]. Weekly averages may be up to 50 percent higher. A sewage treatment plant providing both primary and secondary treatment is expected to remove at least 85 percent of the BOD and suspended solids from domestic sewage. The EPA regulations describe [[stabilization pond]]s as providing treatment equivalent to secondary treatment removing 65 percent of the BOD and suspended solids from incoming sewage and discharging approximately 50 percent higher effluent concentrations than modern bioreactors. The regulations also recognize the difficulty of meeting the specified removal percentages from [[combined sewer]]s, dilute industrial wastewater, or [[Infiltration/Inflow]].&lt;ref&gt;EPA (1984). "Secondary Treatment Regulation: Special considerations." {{CodeFedReg|40|133|103}}; and "Treatment equivalent to secondary treatment." {{CodeFedReg|40|133|105}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Where natural waterways are too small to rapidly oxidize primary treated sewage, the liquid may be used to [[irrigation|irrigate]] [[sewage farm]]s until suburban property values encourage secondary treatment methods requiring less acreage. Glacial [[outwash plain|sand deposits]] allowed some northeastern United States cities to use [[slow sand filter|intermittent sand filtration]] until more compact secondary treatment [[bioreactor]]s became available.&lt;ref&gt;Fair, Geyer &amp; Okun, p.34-1&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Sewage treatment#Biological nutrient removal|Biological nutrient removal]] is regarded by some sanitary engineers as secondary treatment and by others as tertiary treatment. The differentiation may also differ from one country to another.

=== Tertiary treatment ===
The purpose of [[Sewage treatment#Tertiary treatment|tertiary treatment]] (also called "advanced treatment") is to provide a final treatment stage to further improve the effluent quality before it is discharged to the receiving environment (sea, river, lake, wet lands, ground, etc.). Tertiary treatment may include biological nutrient removal (alternatively, this can be classified as secondary treatment), disinfection and removal of micropollutants, such as [[environmental persistent pharmaceutical pollutant]]s.

==Process upsets==
Process upsets are temporary decreases in treatment plant performance caused by significant population change within the secondary treatment ecosystem.&lt;ref&gt;King, p.703&lt;/ref&gt; Conditions likely to create upsets include for example toxic chemicals and unusually high or low concentrations of organic waste BOD providing food for the bioreactor ecosystem.

===Toxicity===
Waste containing [[biocide]] concentrations exceeding the secondary treatment ecosystem tolerance level may kill a major fraction of one or more important ecosystem species. BOD reduction normally accomplished by that species temporarily ceases until other species reach a suitable population to utilize that food source, or the original population recovers as biocide concentrations decline.&lt;ref&gt;Hammer, p.308&lt;/ref&gt;

===Dilution===
Waste containing unusually low BOD concentrations may fail to sustain the secondary treatment population required for normal waste concentrations. The reduced population surviving the starvation event may be unable to completely utilize available BOD when waste loads return to normal. Dilution may be caused by addition of large volumes of relatively uncontaminated water such as stormwater runoff into a combined sewer. Smaller sewage treatment plants may experience dilution from cooling water discharges, major plumbing leaks, firefighting, or draining large swimming pools.

A similar problem occurs as BOD concentrations drop when low flow increases waste residence time within the secondary treatment bioreactor. Secondary treatment ecosystems of college communities acclimated to waste loading fluctuations from student work/sleep cycles may have difficulty surviving school vacations. Secondary treatment systems accustomed to routine production cycles of industrial facilities may have difficulty surviving industrial plant shutdown. Populations of species feeding on incoming waste initially decline as concentration of those food sources decrease. Population decline continues as ecosystem predator populations compete for a declining population of lower [[trophic level]] organisms.&lt;ref&gt;Metcalf &amp; Eddy, pp.386-395&lt;/ref&gt;

===Peak waste load===
High BOD concentrations initially exceed the ability of the secondary treatment ecosystem to utilize available food. Ecosystem populations of aerobic organisms increase until oxygen transfer limitations of the secondary treatment bioreactor are reached. Secondary treatment ecosystem populations may shift toward species with lower oxygen requirements, but failure of those species to use some food sources may produce higher effluent BOD concentrations. More extreme increases in BOD concentrations may drop oxygen concentrations before the secondary treatment ecosystem population can adjust, and cause an abrupt population decrease among important species. Normal BOD removal efficiency will not be restored until populations of aerobic species recover after oxygen concentrations rise to normal.

===Design for damage control===
Measures creating uniform wastewater loadings tend to reduce the probability of upsets. Fixed-film or attached growth secondary treatment bioreactors are similar to a [[plug flow reactor model]] circulating water over surfaces colonized by [[biofilm]], while suspended-growth bioreactors resemble a [[continuous stirred-tank reactor]] keeping microorganisms suspended while water is being treated. Secondary treatment bioreactors may be followed by a physical phase separation to remove biological solids from the treated water. Upset duration of fixed film secondary treatment systems may be longer because of the time required to recolonize the treatment surfaces. Suspended growth ecosystems may be restored from a population reservoir. Activated sludge recycle systems provide an integrated reservoir if upset conditions are detected in time for corrective action. Sludge recycle may be temporarily turned off to prevent sludge washout during peak storm flows when dilution keeps BOD concentrations low. Suspended growth [[activated sludge]] systems can be operated in a smaller space than fixed-film [[trickling filter]] systems that treat the same amount of water; but fixed-film systems are better able to cope with drastic changes in the amount of biological material and can provide higher removal rates for organic material and suspended solids than suspended growth systems.&lt;ref name="EPA Primer"&gt;EPA (2004). [http://www.epa.gov/npdes/pubs/primer.pdf "Primer for Municipal Waste water Treatment Systems."] Document no. EPA 832-R-04-001.&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|11–13}}

Wastewater flow variations may be reduced by limiting stormwater collection by the sewer system, and by requiring industrial facilities to discharge batch process wastes to the sewer over a time interval rather than immediately after creation. Discharge of appropriate organic industrial wastes may be timed to sustain the secondary treatment ecosystem through periods of low residential waste flow.&lt;ref&gt;Hammer, p.301-306&lt;/ref&gt; Sewage treatment systems experiencing holiday waste load fluctuations may provide alternative food to sustain secondary treatment ecosystems through periods of reduced use. Small facilities may prepare a solution of soluble sugars. Others may find compatible agricultural wastes, or offer disposal incentives to [[septic tank]] pumpers during low use periods.

==Process types==

A great number of secondary treatment processes exist, see [[List of wastewater treatment technologies]]. The main ones are explained below.

===Filter beds (oxidizing beds)===
{{main|Trickling filter}}

In older plants and those receiving variable loadings, [[trickling filter]] beds are used where the settled sewage liquor is spread onto the surface of a bed made up of [[coke (fuel)|coke]] (carbonized coal), [[limestone]] chips or specially fabricated plastic media. Such media must have large surface areas to support the biofilms that form. The liquor is typically distributed through perforated spray arms. The distributed liquor trickles through the bed and is collected in drains at the base. These drains also provide a source of air which percolates up through the bed, keeping it aerobic. Biofilms of bacteria, protozoa and fungi form on the media’s surfaces and eat or otherwise reduce the organic content.&lt;ref name="EPA Primer" /&gt;{{rp|12}} The filter removes a small percentage of the suspended organic matter, while the majority of the organic matter supports microorganism reproduction and cell growth from the biological oxidation and nitrification taking place in the filter. With this aerobic oxidation and nitrification, the organic solids are converted into biofilm grazed by insect larvae, snails, and worms which help maintain an optimal thickness. Overloading of beds may increase biofilm thickness leading to anaerobic conditions and possible [[bioclogging]] of the filter media and ponding on the surface.&lt;ref&gt;Metcalf &amp; Eddy, pp.533-542&lt;/ref&gt;

===Rotating biological contactors===
{{main|Rotating biological contactor}}
[[File:Rotating Biological Contactor.png|thumb|right|373 px|Schematic of a typical rotating [[Biological oxidizer|biological contactor]] (RBC). The treated effluent clarifier/settler is not included in the diagram.]]
Rotating biological contactors (RBCs) are robust mechanical fixed-film secondary treatment systems capable of withstanding surges in organic load. RBCs were first installed in [[Germany]] in 1960 and have since been developed and refined into a reliable operating unit. The rotating disks support the growth of bacteria and micro-organisms present in the sewage, which break down and stabilize organic pollutants. To be successful, micro-organisms need both oxygen to live and food to grow. Oxygen is obtained from the atmosphere as the disks rotate. As the micro-organisms grow, they build up on the media until they are sloughed off due to shear forces provided by the rotating discs in the sewage. Effluent from the RBC is then passed through a secondary clarifier where the sloughed biological solids in suspension settle as a sludge.&lt;ref&gt;Steel &amp; McGhee, pp.492-493&lt;/ref&gt;

===Activated sludge===
{{main|Activated sludge}}
[[File:Activated Sludge 1.svg|thumb|right|318px|A generalized schematic of an activated sludge process.]]
Activated sludge is a common suspended-growth method of secondary treatment. Activated sludge plants encompass a variety of mechanisms and processes using dissolved [[oxygen]] to promote growth of biological floc that substantially removes organic material.&lt;ref name="EPA Primer" /&gt;{{rp|12–13}} Biological floc is an ecosystem of living biota subsisting on nutrients from the inflowing primary clarifier effluent. These mostly carbonaceous dissolved solids undergo aeration to be broken down and either biologically oxidized to carbon dioxide or converted to additional biological floc of reproducing micro-organisms. Nitrogenous dissolved solids (amino acids, [[ammonia]], etc.) are similarly converted to biological floc or oxidized by the floc to [[nitrite]]s, [[nitrate]]s, and, in some processes, to [[nitrogen]] gas through [[denitrification]]. While denitrification is encouraged in some treatment processes, denitrification often impairs the settling of the floc causing poor quality effluent in many suspended aeration plants. Overflow from the activated sludge mixing chamber is sent to a secondary clarifier where the suspended biological floc settles out while the treated water moves into tertiary treatment or disinfection. Settled floc is returned to the mixing basin to continue growing in primary effluent. Like most ecosystems, population changes among activated sludge biota can reduce treatment efficiency. [[Nocardia]], a floating brown foam sometimes misidentified as ''sewage fungus'', is the best known of many different fungi and protists that can overpopulate the floc and cause process upsets. Elevated concentrations of toxic wastes including pesticides, industrial metal plating waste, or extreme pH, can kill the biota of an activated sludge reactor ecosystem.&lt;ref&gt;Metcalf &amp; Eddy, pp.482-533&lt;/ref&gt;

====Package plants and sequencing batch reactors====
One type of system that combines secondary treatment and settlement is the cyclic activated sludge (CASSBR), or [[sequencing batch reactor]] (SBR). Typically,  [[activated sludge]] is mixed with raw incoming sewage, and then mixed and aerated.  The settled sludge is run off and re-aerated before a proportion is returned to the headworks.&lt;ref&gt;EPA (1999). [http://www.epa.gov/npdes/pubs/sbr_new.pdf "Sequencing Batch Reactors."] Wastewater Technology Fact Sheet. Document no. EPA 832-F-99-073.&lt;/ref&gt;

The disadvantage of the CASSBR process is that it requires a precise control of timing, mixing and aeration. This precision is typically achieved with computer controls linked to sensors. Such a complex, fragile system is unsuited to places where controls may be unreliable, poorly maintained, or where the power supply may be intermittent.  [[Extended aeration]] package plants use separate basins for aeration and settling, and are somewhat larger than SBR plants with reduced timing sensitivity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author=Hammer, Mark J. | title=Water and Waste-Water Technology | year=1975 |publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons | pages=390–391 | isbn=0-471-34726-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Package plants may be referred to as ''high charged'' or ''low charged''. This refers to the way the biological load is processed. In high charged systems, the biological stage is presented with a high organic load and the combined floc and organic material is then oxygenated for a few hours before being charged again with a new load. In the low charged system the biological stage contains a low organic load and is combined with [[Flocculation|flocculate]] for longer times.

====Membrane bioreactors====
{{Main|Membrane bioreactor}}
Membrane bioreactors (MBR) are activated sludge systems using a [[Membrane technology|membrane]] liquid-solid phase separation process. The membrane component uses low pressure [[microfiltration]] or [[ultrafiltration]] membranes and eliminates the need for a secondary clarifier or filtration. The membranes are typically immersed in the aeration tank; however, some applications utilize a separate membrane tank. One of the key benefits of an MBR system is that it effectively overcomes the limitations associated with poor settling of sludge in conventional [[activated sludge]] (CAS) processes. The technology permits bioreactor operation with considerably higher mixed liquor suspended solids (MLSS) concentration than CAS systems, which are limited by sludge settling. The process is typically operated at MLSS in the range of 8,000–12,000&amp;nbsp;mg/L, while CAS are operated in the range of 2,000–3,000&amp;nbsp;mg/L. The elevated biomass concentration in the MBR process allows for very effective removal of both soluble and particulate biodegradable materials at higher loading rates. Thus increased sludge retention times, usually exceeding 15 days, ensure complete nitrification even in extremely cold weather.

The cost of building and operating an MBR is often higher than conventional methods of sewage treatment. Membrane filters can be blinded with grease or abraded by suspended grit and lack a clarifier's flexibility to pass peak flows.  The technology has become increasingly popular for reliably pretreated waste streams and has gained wider acceptance where infiltration and inflow have been controlled, however, and the life-cycle costs have been steadily decreasing. The small footprint of MBR systems, and the high quality effluent produced, make them particularly useful for water reuse applications.&lt;ref&gt;EPA. Washington, DC (2007). [http://water.epa.gov/scitech/wastetech/upload/2008_01_23_mtb_etfs_membrane-bioreactors.pdf "Membrane Bioreactors."] Wastewater Management Fact Sheet.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Aerobic granulation====
{{Main|Aerobic granulation}}
[[File:Nereda biomass left and activated sludge after only minutes of settling.jpg|thumb|right]]
Aerobic granular sludge can be formed by applying specific process conditions that favour slow growing organisms such as PAOs (polyphosphate accumulating organisms) and GAOs (glycogen accumulating organisms). Another key part of granulation is selective wasting whereby slow settling floc-like sludge is discharged as waste sludge and faster settling biomass is retained. This process has been commercialized as [[Nereda|Nereda process]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.thesourcemagazine.org/mark-van-loosdrecht-professor-at-delft-university-of-technology/ |title=Mark van Loosdrecht – Professor at Delft University of Technology |last=Forster |first=Richard |website=Source |publisher=[[International Water Association]] |accessdate=24 April 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Surface-aerated lagoons or ponds===
{{Main|Aerated lagoon}}
[[File:Surface-Aerated Basin.png|thumb|right|318px|A typical surface-aerated basin (using motor-driven floating aerators)]]
Aerated lagoons are a [[low technology]] suspended-growth method of secondary treatment using motor-driven aerators floating on the water surface to increase atmospheric oxygen transfer to the lagoon and to mix the lagoon contents. The floating surface aerators are typically rated to deliver the amount of air equivalent to 1.8 to 2.7&amp;nbsp;kg [[Oxygen|O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]]/[[watt-hour|kW·h]]. Aerated lagoons provide less effective mixing than conventional activated sludge systems and do not achieve the same performance level. The basins may range in depth from 1.5 to 5.0 metres. Surface-aerated basins achieve 80 to 90 percent removal of BOD with retention times of 1 to 10 days.&lt;ref name=Basin&gt;{{cite journal|author=Beychok, M.R.|year=1971|title=Performance of surface-aerated basins|journal=Chemical Engineering Progress Symposium Series|volume=67|issue=107|pages=322–339}} [http://md1.csa.com/partners/viewrecord.php?requester=gs&amp;collection=ENV&amp;recid=7112203&amp;q=&amp;uid=788301038&amp;setcookie=yes Available at CSA Illumina website] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071114140052/http://md1.csa.com/partners/viewrecord.php?requester=gs&amp;collection=ENV&amp;recid=7112203&amp;q=&amp;uid=788301038&amp;setcookie=yes |date=2007-11-14 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Many small municipal sewage systems in the United States (1 million gal./day or less) use aerated lagoons.&lt;ref&gt;Maine Department of Environmental Protection. Augusta, ME. [http://www.lagoonsonline.com "Aerated Lagoons – Wastewater Treatment."] Maine Lagoon Systems Task Force. Accessed 2010-07-11.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Constructed wetlands===
{{Main|Constructed wetland}}
Primary clarifier effluent was discharged directly to [[eutrophic]] natural [[wetland]]s for decades before environmental regulations discouraged the practice. Where adequate land is available, stabilization ponds with constructed wetland ecosystems can be built to perform secondary treatment separated from the natural wetlands receiving secondary treated sewage. Constructed wetlands resemble fixed-film systems more than suspended growth systems, because natural mixing is minimal. Constructed wetland design uses plug flow assumptions to compute the residence time required for treatment. Patterns of vegetation growth and solids deposition in wetland ecosystems, however, can create preferential flow pathways which may reduce average residence time.&lt;ref&gt;Reed, Middlebrooks &amp; Crites, pp.170-201&lt;/ref&gt; Measurement of wetland treatment efficiency is complicated because most traditional water quality measurements cannot differentiate between sewage pollutants and biological productivity of the wetland. Demonstration of treatment efficiency may require more expensive analyses.&lt;ref&gt;Franson, Mary Ann ''Standard Methods for the Examination of Water and Wastewater'' 14th Edition (1976) American Public Health Association {{ISBN|0-87553-078-8}} pp.89-95&amp;543-544&lt;/ref&gt;

===Emerging technologies===
* Biological Aerated (or Anoxic) Filter (BAF) or Biofilters combine filtration with biological carbon reduction, [[nitrification]] or denitrification. BAF usually includes a reactor filled with a [[filter (water)|filter]] media. The media is either in suspension or supported by a gravel layer at the foot of the filter. The dual purpose of this media is to support highly active biomass that is attached to it and to filter suspended solids. Carbon reduction and ammonia conversion occurs in aerobic mode and sometime achieved in a single reactor while nitrate conversion occurs in [[hypoxia (environmental)|anoxic]] mode. BAF is operated either in upflow or downflow configuration depending on design specified by manufacturer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=EPA |first= |authorlink = |title =An Emerging Technology: The Biological Aerated Filter |publisher =United States Government Printing Office |volume = |edition = |date =July 1983 |location = |pages = |isbn =}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Integrated Fixed-Film Activated Sludge 
* Moving Bed Biofilm Reactors typically requires smaller footprint than suspended-growth systems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://bv.com/Downloads/Resources/Brochures/rsrc_WTR_IFASMBBR.pdf |title=Black &amp; Veatch, Inc. leaflet |accessdate=2015-01-03 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101026171954/http://bv.com/Downloads/Resources/Brochures/rsrc_WTR_IFASMBBR.pdf |archivedate=October 26, 2010 |df= }}.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="23940">The '''simply typed lambda calculus''' (&lt;math&gt;\lambda^\to&lt;/math&gt;), a form
of [[type theory]], is a [[typed lambda calculus|typed interpretation]] of the [[lambda calculus]] with only one [[type constructor]]: &lt;math&gt;\to&lt;/math&gt; that builds [[function type]]s. It is the canonical and simplest example of a typed lambda calculus.  The simply typed lambda calculus was originally introduced by [[Alonzo Church]] in 1940 as an attempt to avoid paradoxical uses of the [[untyped lambda calculus]], and it exhibits many desirable and interesting properties.

The term ''simple type'' is also used to refer to extensions of the simply typed lambda calculus such as [[cartesian product|products]], [[coproduct]]s or [[natural number]]s ([[Dialectica interpretation|System T]]) or even full [[recursion]] (like [[Programming language for Computable Functions|PCF]]). In contrast, systems which introduce polymorphic types (like [[System F]]) or [[dependent type]]s (like the [[LF (logical framework)|Logical Framework]]) are not considered ''simply typed''.  The former, except full recursion, are still considered  ''simple'' because the [[Church encoding]]s of such structures can be done using only &lt;math&gt;\to&lt;/math&gt; and suitable type variables, while polymorphism and dependency cannot.

== Syntax ==

In this article, we use &lt;math&gt;\sigma&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\tau&lt;/math&gt; to range over types. Informally, the ''function type'' &lt;math&gt;\sigma \to \tau&lt;/math&gt; refers to the type of functions that, given an input of type &lt;math&gt;\sigma&lt;/math&gt;, produce an output of type &lt;math&gt;\tau&lt;/math&gt;.
By convention, &lt;math&gt;\to&lt;/math&gt; associates to the right: we read &lt;math&gt;\sigma\to\tau\to\rho&lt;/math&gt; as &lt;math&gt;\sigma\to(\tau\to\rho)&lt;/math&gt;.

To define the types, we begin by fixing a set of ''base types'', &lt;math&gt;B&lt;/math&gt;. These are sometimes called ''atomic types'' or ''type constants''. With this fixed, the syntax of types is:

:&lt;math&gt;\tau ::= \tau \to \tau \mid T \quad \mathrm{where} \quad T \in B&lt;/math&gt;.

For example, &lt;math&gt;B = \{a, b\}&lt;/math&gt;, generates an infinite set of types starting with &lt;math&gt;a,b,&lt;/math&gt;&lt;math&gt;a \to a,&lt;/math&gt;&lt;math&gt;a \to b,b\to b,&lt;/math&gt;&lt;math&gt;b\to a,&lt;/math&gt;&lt;math&gt; a \to (a \to a),\ldots,&lt;/math&gt;&lt;math&gt;(b\to a) \to (a\to b), \ldots&lt;/math&gt;

We also fix a set of ''term constants'' for the base types. For example, we might assume a base type &lt;tt&gt;nat&lt;/tt&gt;, and the term constants could be the natural numbers. In the original presentation, Church used only two base types: &lt;math&gt;o&lt;/math&gt; for "the type of propositions" and &lt;math&gt;\iota&lt;/math&gt; for "the type of individuals". The type &lt;math&gt;o&lt;/math&gt; has no term constants, whereas &lt;math&gt;\iota&lt;/math&gt; has one term constant. Frequently the calculus with only one base type, usually &lt;math&gt;o&lt;/math&gt;, is considered.

The syntax of the simply typed lambda calculus is essentially that of the lambda calculus itself.  We write &lt;math&gt;x\mathbin{:}\tau&lt;/math&gt; to denote that the variable &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; is of type &lt;math&gt;\tau&lt;/math&gt;.  The term syntax, in BNF, is then:

:&lt;math&gt;e ::= x \mid \lambda x\mathbin{:}\tau.e \mid e \, e \mid c&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;c&lt;/math&gt; is a term constant.

That is, ''variable reference'', ''abstractions'', ''application'', and ''constant''.  A variable reference &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; is ''bound'' if it is inside of an abstraction binding &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;.  A term is ''closed'' if there are no unbound variables.

Compare this to the syntax of untyped lambda calculus:

:&lt;math&gt;e ::= x \mid \lambda x.e \mid e \, e&lt;/math&gt;

We see that in typed lambda calculus every function (''abstraction'') must specify the type of its argument.

== Typing rules ==

To define the set of well typed lambda terms of a given type, we will define a typing relation between terms and types.  First, we introduce ''typing contexts'' or ''[[typing environment]]s'' &lt;math&gt;\Gamma,\Delta,\dots&lt;/math&gt;, which are sets of typing assumptions.  A ''typing assumption'' has the form &lt;math&gt;x\mathbin{:}\sigma&lt;/math&gt;, meaning &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; has type &lt;math&gt;\sigma&lt;/math&gt;.

The ''typing relation'' &lt;math&gt;\Gamma\vdash e\mathbin{:}\sigma&lt;/math&gt; indicates that &lt;math&gt;e&lt;/math&gt; is a term of type &lt;math&gt;\sigma&lt;/math&gt; in context &lt;math&gt;\Gamma&lt;/math&gt;.  In this case &lt;math&gt;e&lt;/math&gt; is said to be ''well-typed'' (having type &lt;math&gt;\sigma&lt;/math&gt;).  Instances of the typing relation are called ''typing judgements''.  The validity of a typing judgement is shown by providing a ''typing derivation'', constructed using [[type rules|typing rules]] (wherein the premises above the line allow us to derive the conclusion below the line).  Simply-typed lambda calculus uses these rules:

{| align="center" cellpadding="9"
| align="center" | &lt;math&gt;{\frac{x\mathbin{:}\sigma \in \Gamma}{\Gamma \vdash x\mathbin{:}\sigma} }&lt;/math&gt; (1)
| align="center" | &lt;math&gt;{\frac{c \text{ is a constant of type } T}{\Gamma\vdash c\mathbin{:}T}}&lt;/math&gt; (2)
|-
| align="center" | &lt;math&gt;{\frac{\Gamma,x\mathbin{:}\sigma\vdash e\mathbin{:}\tau}{\Gamma\vdash (\lambda x\mathbin{:}\sigma.~e)\mathbin{:}(\sigma \to \tau)}}&lt;/math&gt; (3)
| align="center" | &lt;math&gt;{\frac{\Gamma\vdash e_1\mathbin{:}\sigma\to\tau\quad\Gamma\vdash e_2\mathbin{:}\sigma}{\Gamma\vdash e_1~e_2\mathbin{:}\tau}}&lt;/math&gt; (4)
|}

In words,
# If &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; has type &lt;math&gt;\sigma&lt;/math&gt; in the context, we know that &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; has type &lt;math&gt;\sigma&lt;/math&gt;.
# Term constants have the appropriate base types.
# If, in a certain context with &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; having type &lt;math&gt;\sigma&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;e&lt;/math&gt; has type &lt;math&gt;\tau&lt;/math&gt;, then, in the same context without &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\lambda x\mathbin{:}\sigma.~e&lt;/math&gt; has type &lt;math&gt;\sigma \to \tau&lt;/math&gt;.
# If, in a certain context, &lt;math&gt;e_1&lt;/math&gt; has type &lt;math&gt;\sigma \to \tau&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;e_2&lt;/math&gt; has type &lt;math&gt;\sigma&lt;/math&gt;, then &lt;math&gt;e_1~e_2&lt;/math&gt; has type &lt;math&gt;\tau&lt;/math&gt;.

Examples of closed terms, ''i.e.'' terms typable in the empty context, are:
*For every type &lt;math&gt;\tau&lt;/math&gt;, a term &lt;math&gt;\lambda x\mathbin{:}\tau.x\mathbin{:}\tau\to\tau&lt;/math&gt; (identity function/I-combinator),
*For types &lt;math&gt;\sigma,\tau&lt;/math&gt;, a term &lt;math&gt;\lambda x\mathbin{:}\sigma.\lambda y\mathbin{:}\tau.x\mathbin{:}\sigma \to \tau \to \sigma&lt;/math&gt; (the K-combinator), and
*For types &lt;math&gt;\tau,\tau',\tau''&lt;/math&gt;, a term &lt;math&gt;\lambda x\mathbin{:}\tau\to\tau'\to\tau''.\lambda y\mathbin{:}\tau\to\tau'.\lambda z\mathbin{:}\tau.x z (y z) : (\tau\to\tau'\to\tau'')\to(\tau\to\tau')\to\tau\to\tau''&lt;/math&gt; (the S-combinator).
These are the typed lambda calculus representations of the basic combinators of [[combinatory logic]].

Each type &lt;math&gt;\tau&lt;/math&gt; is assigned an order, a number &lt;math&gt;o(\tau)&lt;/math&gt;. For base types, &lt;math&gt;o(T)=0&lt;/math&gt;; for function types, &lt;math&gt;o(\sigma\to\tau)=\mbox{max}(o(\sigma)+1,o(\tau))&lt;/math&gt;.  That is, the order of a type measures the depth of the most left-nested arrow. Hence:

: &lt;math&gt;o(\iota \to \iota \to \iota) = 1&lt;/math&gt;

: &lt;math&gt;o((\iota \to \iota) \to \iota) = 2&lt;/math&gt;

== Semantics ==

=== Intrinsic vs. extrinsic interpretations ===

Broadly speaking, there are two different ways of assigning meaning to the simply typed lambda calculus, as to typed languages more generally, sometimes called ''intrinsic'' vs. ''extrinsic'', or ''[[Alonzo Church|Church]]-style'' vs. ''[[Haskell Curry|Curry]]-style''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book
| first = John | last = Reynolds | author-link=John_C._Reynolds
| publisher = Cambridge University Press
| location = Cambridge, England
| title=Theories of Programming Languages
| year=1998
}}&lt;/ref&gt;
An intrinsic/Church-style semantics only assigns meaning to well-typed terms, or more precisely, assigns meaning directly to typing derivations.  This has the effect that terms differing only by type annotations can nonetheless be assigned different meanings.  For example, the identity term &lt;math&gt;\lambda x\mathbin{:}\mathtt{int}.~x&lt;/math&gt; on integers and the identity term &lt;math&gt;\lambda x\mathbin{:}\mathtt{bool}.~x&lt;/math&gt; on booleans may mean different things.  (The classic intended interpretations
are the identity function on integers and the identity function on boolean values.)
In contrast, an extrinsic/Curry-style semantics assigns meaning to terms regardless of typing, as they would be interpreted in an untyped language.  In this view, &lt;math&gt;\lambda x\mathbin{:}\mathtt{int}.~x&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\lambda x\mathbin{:}\mathtt{bool}.~x&lt;/math&gt; mean the same thing (''i.e.'', the same thing as &lt;math&gt;\lambda x.~x&lt;/math&gt;).

The distinction between intrinsic and extrinsic semantics is sometimes associated with the presence or absence of annotations on lambda abstractions, but strictly speaking this usage is imprecise.  It is possible to define a Curry-style semantics on annotated terms simply by ignoring the types (''i.e.'', through [[type erasure]]), as it is possible to give a Church-style semantics on unannotated terms when the types can be deduced from context (''i.e.'', through [[type inference]]).  The essential difference between intrinsic and extrinsic approaches is just whether the typing rules are viewed as defining the language, or as a formalism for verifying properties of a more primitive underlying language.  Most of the different semantic interpretations discussed below can be seen through either a Church or Curry perspective.

=== Equational theory ===

The simply typed lambda calculus has the same [[equational theory]] of βη-equivalence as [[Untyped lambda calculus#Reduction|untyped lambda calculus]], but subject to type restrictions.  The equation for [[beta reduction]]
:&lt;math&gt;(\lambda x\mathbin{:}\sigma.~t)\,u =_{\beta} t[x:=u]&lt;/math&gt;
holds in context &lt;math&gt;\Gamma&lt;/math&gt; whenever &lt;math&gt;\Gamma,x\mathbin{:}\sigma \vdash t\mathbin{:}\tau&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\Gamma\vdash u\mathbin{:}\sigma&lt;/math&gt;, while the equation for [[eta reduction]]
:&lt;math&gt;\lambda x\mathbin{:}\sigma.~t\,x =_\eta t&lt;/math&gt;
holds whenever &lt;math&gt;\Gamma\vdash t\!:\sigma \to \tau&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; does not appear free in &lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt;.

=== Operational semantics ===

Likewise, the [[operational semantics]] of simply typed lambda calculus can be fixed as for the untyped lambda calculus, using [[call by name]], [[call by value]], or other [[evaluation strategy|evaluation strategies]].  As for any typed language, [[type safety]] is a fundamental property of all of these evaluation strategies.  Additionally, the [[strong normalization]] property [[Simply typed lambda calculus#Important results|described below]] implies that any evaluation strategy will terminate on all simply typed terms.

=== Categorical semantics ===
The simply typed lambda calculus (with  &lt;math&gt;\beta\eta&lt;/math&gt;-equivalence) is the [[internal language]] of [[Cartesian closed categories]] (CCCs), as was first observed by [[Joachim Lambek|Lambek]].  Given any specific CCC, the basic types of the corresponding lambda calculus are just the [[object (category theory)|objects]], and the terms are the [[morphism]]s. Conversely, every simply typed lambda calculus gives a CCC whose objects are the types, and morphisms are equivalence classes of terms.

To make the correspondence clear, a [[type constructor]] for the [[Cartesian product]] is typically added to the above.  To preserve the [[product (category theory)|categoricity of the Cartesian product]], one adds [[type rule]]s for ''pairing'', ''projection'', and a ''unit term''. Given two terms &lt;math&gt;s\mathbin{:}\sigma&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;t\mathbin{:}\tau&lt;/math&gt;, the term &lt;math&gt;(s,t)&lt;/math&gt; has type &lt;math&gt;\sigma\times\tau&lt;/math&gt;.  Likewise, if one has a term &lt;math&gt;u\mathbin{:}\tau_1\times\tau_2&lt;/math&gt;, then there are terms &lt;math&gt;\pi_1(u)\mathbin{:}\tau_1&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\pi_2(u)\mathbin{:}\tau_2&lt;/math&gt; where the &lt;math&gt;\pi_i&lt;/math&gt; correspond to the projections of the Cartesian product. The ''unit term'', of type 1, is written as &lt;math&gt;()&lt;/math&gt; and vocalized as 'nil', is the [[final object]].  The equational theory is extended likewise, so that one has
:&lt;math&gt;\pi_1(s\mathbin{:}\sigma,t\mathbin{:}\tau) = s\mathbin{:}\sigma&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\pi_2(s\mathbin{:}\sigma,t\mathbin{:}\tau) = t\mathbin{:}\tau&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;(\pi_1(u\mathbin{:}\sigma\times\tau) , \pi_2(u\mathbin{:}\sigma\times\tau)) =u\mathbin{:}\sigma\times\tau&lt;/math&gt;  
:&lt;math&gt;t\mathbin{:}1 = ()&lt;/math&gt;
This last is read as "''if t has type 1, then it reduces to nil''".

The above can then be turned into a category by taking the types as the [[object (category theory)|objects]]. The [[morphism]]s &lt;math&gt;\sigma\to\tau&lt;/math&gt; are [[equivalence class]]es of pairs &lt;math&gt;(x\mathbin{:}\sigma, t\mathbin{:}\tau)&lt;/math&gt; where ''x'' is a variable (of type &lt;math&gt;\sigma&lt;/math&gt;) and ''t'' is a term (of type &lt;math&gt;\tau&lt;/math&gt;), having no free variables in it, except for (optionally) ''x''. Closure is obtained from [[currying]] and [[apply|application]], as usual.

More precisely, there exist [[functor]]s between the category of Cartesian closed categories, and the category of simply-typed lambda theories.

It is common to extend this case to [[closed monoidal category|closed symmetric monoidal categories]] by using a [[linear type system]]. The reason for this is that the CCC is a special case of the closed symmetric monoidal category, which is typically taken to be the [[category of sets]].  This is fine for laying the foundations of [[set theory]], but the more general [[topos]] seems to provide a superior foundation.

=== Proof-theoretic semantics ===

The simply typed lambda calculus is closely related to the implicational fragment of propositional [[intuitionistic logic]], i.e., [[minimal logic]], via the [[Curry–Howard isomorphism]]: terms correspond precisely to proofs in [[natural deduction]], and [[Type inhabitation|inhabited types]] are exactly the [[tautology (logic)|tautologies]] of minimal logic.

== Alternative syntaxes ==

The presentation given above is not the only way of defining the syntax of the simply typed lambda calculus.  One alternative is to remove type annotations entirely (so that the syntax is identical to the untyped lambda calculus), while ensuring that terms are well-typed via [[Hindley–Milner type inference]].  The inference algorithm is terminating, sound, and complete: whenever a term is typable, the algorithm computes its type.  More precisely, it computes the term's [[principal type]], since often an unannotated term (such as &lt;math&gt;\lambda x.~x&lt;/math&gt;) may have more than one type (&lt;math&gt;\mathtt{int} \to \mathtt{int}&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\mathtt{bool} \to \mathtt{bool}&lt;/math&gt;, etc., which are all instances of the principal type &lt;math&gt;\alpha \to \alpha&lt;/math&gt;).

Another alternative presentation of simply typed lambda calculus is based on '''bidirectional type checking''', which requires more type annotations than Hindley–Milner inference but is easier to describe.  The [[type system]] is divided into two judgments, representing both ''checking'' and ''synthesis'', written &lt;math&gt;\Gamma \vdash e \Leftarrow \tau&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\Gamma \vdash e \Rightarrow \tau&lt;/math&gt; respectively.  Operationally, the three components &lt;math&gt;\Gamma&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;e&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;\tau&lt;/math&gt; are all ''inputs'' to the checking judgment &lt;math&gt;\Gamma \vdash e \Leftarrow \tau&lt;/math&gt;, whereas the synthesis judgment &lt;math&gt;\Gamma \vdash e \Rightarrow \tau&lt;/math&gt; only takes &lt;math&gt;\Gamma&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;e&lt;/math&gt; as inputs, producing the type &lt;math&gt;\tau&lt;/math&gt; as output.  These judgments are derived via the following rules:
{| align="center" cellpadding="9"
| align="center" | &lt;math&gt;{\frac{x\mathbin{:}\sigma \in \Gamma}{\Gamma \vdash x \Rightarrow \sigma} }&lt;/math&gt; [1]
| align="center" | &lt;math&gt;{\frac{c \text{ is a constant of type } T}{\Gamma\vdash c \Rightarrow T}}&lt;/math&gt; [2]
|-
| align="center" | &lt;math&gt;{\frac{\Gamma,x\mathbin{:}\sigma\vdash e\Leftarrow \tau}{\Gamma\vdash \lambda x.~e \Leftarrow \sigma \to \tau}}&lt;/math&gt; [3]
| align="center" | &lt;math&gt;{\frac{\Gamma\vdash e_1\Rightarrow \sigma\to\tau\quad\Gamma\vdash e_2\Leftarrow\sigma}{\Gamma\vdash e_1~e_2 \Rightarrow \tau}}&lt;/math&gt; [4]
|-
| align="center" | &lt;math&gt;{\frac{\Gamma\vdash e \Rightarrow \tau}{\Gamma\vdash e\Leftarrow \tau}}&lt;/math&gt; [5]
| align="center" | &lt;math&gt;{\frac{\Gamma\vdash e \Leftarrow \tau}{\Gamma\vdash (e\mathbin{:}\tau)\Rightarrow \tau}}&lt;/math&gt; [6]
|}
Observe that rules [1]–[4] are nearly identical to rules (1)–(4) above, except for the careful choice of checking or synthesis judgments.  These choices can be explained like so:
# If &lt;math&gt;x\mathbin{:}\sigma&lt;/math&gt; is in the context, we can synthesize type &lt;math&gt;\sigma&lt;/math&gt; for &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;.
# The types of term constants are fixed and can be synthesized.
# To check that &lt;math&gt;\lambda x.~e&lt;/math&gt; has type &lt;math&gt;\sigma \to \tau&lt;/math&gt; in some context, we extend the context with &lt;math&gt;x\mathbin{:}\sigma&lt;/math&gt; and check that &lt;math&gt;e&lt;/math&gt; has type &lt;math&gt;\tau&lt;/math&gt;.
# If &lt;math&gt;e_1&lt;/math&gt; synthesizes type &lt;math&gt;\sigma \to \tau&lt;/math&gt; (in some context), and &lt;math&gt;e_2&lt;/math&gt; checks against type &lt;math&gt;\sigma&lt;/math&gt; (in the same context), then &lt;math&gt;e_1~e_2&lt;/math&gt; synthesizes type &lt;math&gt;\tau&lt;/math&gt;.
Observe that the rules for synthesis are read top-to-bottom, whereas the rules for checking are read bottom-to-top.  Note in particular that we do '''not''' need any annotation on the lambda abstraction in rule [3], because the type of the bound variable can be deduced from the type at which we check the function. Finally, we explain rules [5] and [6] as follows:
&lt;ol start="5"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;To check that &lt;math&gt;e&lt;/math&gt; has type &lt;math&gt;\tau&lt;/math&gt;, it suffices to synthesize type &lt;math&gt;\tau&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If &lt;math&gt;e&lt;/math&gt; checks against type &lt;math&gt;\tau&lt;/math&gt;, then the explicitly annotated term &lt;math&gt;(e\mathbin{:}\tau)&lt;/math&gt; synthesizes &lt;math&gt;\tau&lt;/math&gt;.
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
Because of these last two rules coercing between synthesis and checking, it is easy to see that any well-typed but unannotated term can be checked in the bidirectional system, so long as we insert "enough" type annotations.  And in fact, annotations are needed only at β-redexes.

== General observations ==

Given the standard semantics, the simply typed lambda calculus is [[Normalization property (lambda-calculus)|strongly normalizing]]: that is, well-typed terms always reduce to a value, i.e., a &lt;math&gt;\lambda&lt;/math&gt; abstraction.  This is because recursion is not allowed by the typing rules: it is impossible to find types for [[fixed-point combinator]]s and the looping term &lt;math&gt;\Omega = (\lambda x.~x~x) (\lambda x.~x~x)&lt;/math&gt;.  Recursion can be added to the language by either having a special operator &lt;math&gt;\mathtt{fix}_\alpha&lt;/math&gt;of type &lt;math&gt;(\alpha \to \alpha) \to \alpha&lt;/math&gt; or adding general [[recursive type]]s, though both eliminate strong normalization.

Since it is strongly normalising, it is [[decidability (logic)|decidable]] whether or not a simply typed lambda calculus program halts: in fact, it ''always'' halts. We can therefore conclude that the language is ''not'' [[Turing complete]].

== Important results ==

* Tait showed in 1967 that &lt;math&gt;\beta&lt;/math&gt;-reduction is [[Normalization property (lambda-calculus)|strongly normalizing]]. As a corollary &lt;math&gt;\beta\eta&lt;/math&gt;-equivalence is [[decidability (logic)|decidable]]. Statman showed in 1977 that the normalisation problem is not [[elementary recursive]], a proof which was later simplified by Mairson (1992). A purely semantic normalisation proof (see [[normalisation by evaluation]]) was given by Berger and Schwichtenberg in 1991.
* The [[unification (computing)|unification]] problem for &lt;math&gt;\beta\eta&lt;/math&gt;-equivalence is undecidable. Huet showed in 1973 that 3rd order unification is undecidable and this was improved upon by Baxter in 1978 then by Goldfarb in 1981 by showing that 2nd order unification is already undecidable. A proof that higher order matching (unification where only one term contains existential variables) is decidable was announced by Colin Stirling in 2006, and a full proof was published in 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Stirling|first1=Colin|title=Decidability of higher-order matching|journal=Logical Methods in Computer Science|date=22 July 2009|volume=5|issue=3|pages=1–52|doi=10.2168/LMCS-5(3:2)2009|arxiv=0907.3804|accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* We can encode [[natural number]]s by terms of the type &lt;math&gt;(o\to o)\to(o \to o)&lt;/math&gt; ([[Church numeral]]s). Schwichtenberg showed in 1976 that in &lt;math&gt;\lambda^\to&lt;/math&gt; exactly the extended [[polynomial]]s are representable as functions over Church numerals; these are roughly the polynomials closed up under a conditional operator. 
* A ''full model'' of &lt;math&gt;\lambda^\to&lt;/math&gt; is given by interpreting base types as [[Set (mathematics)|sets]] and function types by the set-theoretic [[function space]]. Friedman showed in 1975 that this interpretation is [[Completeness (logic)|complete]] for &lt;math&gt;\beta\eta&lt;/math&gt;-equivalence, if the base types are interpreted by infinite sets. Statman showed in 1983 that &lt;math&gt;\beta\eta&lt;/math&gt;-equivalence is the maximal equivalence which is ''typically ambiguous'', i.e. closed under type substitutions (''Statman's Typical Ambiguity Theorem''). A corollary of this is that the ''finite model property'' holds, i.e. finite sets are sufficient to distinguish terms which are not identified by &lt;math&gt;\beta\eta&lt;/math&gt;-equivalence.
* Plotkin introduced logical relations in 1973 to characterize the elements of a model which are definable by lambda terms. In 1993 Jung and Tiuryn showed that a general form of logical relation (Kripke logical relations with varying arity) exactly characterizes lambda definability. Plotkin and Statman conjectured that it is decidable whether a given element of a model generated from finite sets is definable by a lambda term (''Plotkin–Statman conjecture''). The conjecture was shown to be false by Loader in 1993.

  London: Academic Press.&lt;/ref&gt;  the Stream X-Machine is a kind of [[X-machine]] for processing a memory data type ''Mem'' with associated input and output streams ''In''* and ''Out''*, that is, where ''X'' = ''Out''* × ''Mem'' × ''In''*.  The transitions of a Stream X-Machine are labelled by functions of the form φ: ''Mem'' × ''In'' → ''Out'' × ''Mem'', that is, which compute an output value and update the memory, from the current memory and an input value.

Although the general [[X-machine]] had been identified in the 1980s as a potentially useful formal model for specifying software systems,&lt;ref name="Hol88"&gt;
M. Holcombe (1988) 'X-machines as a basis for dynamic system specification'. ''Software Engineering Journal'' '''3''' ''(2)'', pp. 69-76.&lt;/ref&gt; it was not until the emergence of the Stream X-Machine that this idea could be fully exploited.  Florentin Ipate and Mike Holcombe went on to develop a theory of ''complete'' [[functional testing]],&lt;ref

Because of the intuitive interpretation of Stream X-Machines as "processing agents with inputs and outputs", they have attracted increasing interest, because of their utility in modelling real-world phenomena.  The SXM model has important applications in fields as diverse as [[computational biology]], [[software testing]] and [[Computational economics|agent-based computational economics]].

== The Stream X-Machine ==

A Stream X-Machine (SXM) is an extended [[finite state machine]] with auxiliary memory, inputs and outputs.  It is a variant of the general [[X-machine]], in which the fundamental data type ''X'' = ''Out''* × ''Mem'' × ''In''*, that is, a tuple consisting of an output stream,  the memory and an input stream. A SXM separates the ''control flow'' of a system from the ''processing'' carried out by the system.  The control is modelled by a [[finite state machine]] (known as the ''associated automaton'') whose transitions are labelled with processing functions chosen from a set Φ (known as the ''type'' of the machine), which act upon the fundamental data type.

Each processing function in Φ is a partial function, and can be considered to have the type φ: ''Mem'' × ''In'' → ''Out'' × ''Mem'', where ''Mem'' is the memory type, and ''In'' and ''Out'' are respectively the input and output types.  In any given state, a transition is ''enabled'' if the domain of the associated function φ&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; includes the next input value and the current memory state.  If (at most) one transition is enabled in a given state, the machine is ''deterministic''.  Crossing a transition is equivalent to applying the associated function φ&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;, which consumes one input, possibly modifies the memory and produces one output.  Each recognised path through the machine therefore generates a list φ&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; ... φ&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt; of functions, and the SXM composes these functions together to generate a relation on the fundamental data type |φ&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; ... φ&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;|: ''X'' → ''X''.

=== Relationship to X-machines ===

The Stream X-Machine is a variant of [[X-machine]] in which the fundamental data type ''X'' = ''Out''* × ''Mem'' × ''In''*.  In the original [[X-machine]], the φ&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; are general ''relations'' on ''X''.  In the Stream X-Machine, these are usually restricted to ''functions''; however the SXM is still only deterministic if (at most) one transition is enabled in each state.

A general [[X-machine]] handles input and output using a prior encoding function α: ''Y'' → ''X'' for input, and a posterior decoding function β: ''X'' → ''Z'' for output, where ''Y'' and ''Z'' are respectively the input and output types.  In a Stream X-Machine, these types are streams:

  ''Y'' = ''In''*
  ''Z'' = ''Out''*

and the encoding and decoding functions are defined as:

  α(''ins'') = (&lt;&gt;, ''mem''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;, ''ins'')
  β(''outs'', ''mem''&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;, &lt;&gt;) = ''outs''

where ''ins: In''*, ''outs: Out''* and ''mem''&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;: ''Mem''.  In other words, the machine is initialized with the whole of the input stream; and the decoded result is the whole of the output stream, provided the input stream is eventually consumed (otherwise the result is undefined).

Each processing function in a SXM is given the abbreviated type φ&lt;sub&gt;SXM&lt;/sub&gt;: ''Mem'' × ''In'' → ''Out'' × ''Mem''.  This can be mapped onto a general [[X-machine]] relation of the type φ: X → X if we treat this as computing:

  φ(''outs'', ''mem''&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;, ''in'' :: ''ins'') = (''outs'' :: ''out'', ''mem''&lt;sub&gt;i+1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''ins'')

where &lt;code&gt;::&lt;/code&gt; denotes concatenation of an element and a sequence.  In other words, the relation extracts the head of the input stream, modifies memory and appends a value to the tail of the output stream.

=== Processing and Testable Properties ===

Because of the above equivalence, attention may focus on the way a Stream X-Machine processes inputs into outputs, using an auxiliary memory.  Given an initial memory state ''mem''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; and an input stream ''ins'', the machine executes in a step-wise fashion, consuming one input at a time, and generating one output at a time.  Provided that (at least) one recognised path ''path'' = φ&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; ... φ&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt; exists leading to a state in which the input has been consumed, the machine yields a final memory state ''mem''&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt; and an output stream ''outs''.  In general, we can think of this as the relation computed by all recognised paths:  | ''path'' | : ''In''* → ''Out''*. This is often called the ''behaviour'' of the Stream X-Machine.

The behaviour is deterministic, if (at most) one transition is enabled in each state.  This property, and the ability to control how the machine behaves in a step-wise fashion in response to inputs and memory, makes it an ideal model for the specification of software systems.  If the specification and implementation are both assumed to be Stream X-Machines, then the implementation may be tested for conformance to the specification machine, by observing the inputs and outputs at each step.  Laycock first highlighted the utility of single-step processing with observations for testing purposes.&lt;ref name="Lay93" /&gt;

Holcombe and Ipate developed this into a practical theory of software testing&lt;ref name="HolIp98" /&gt; which was fully compositional, scaling up to very large systems.&lt;ref name="IpHol98"&gt;F. Ipate and M. Holcombe (1998) 'A method for refining and testing generalised machine specifications'. ''Int. J. Comp. Math.'' '''68''', pp. 197-219.&lt;/ref&gt;  A proof of correct integration&lt;ref name="IpHol97" /&gt; guarantees that  testing each component and each integration layer separately corresponds to testing the whole system.  This divide-and-conquer approach makes ''exhaustive'' testing feasible for large systems.

The testing method is described in a separate article on the [[X-Machine Testing|Stream X-Machine testing methodology]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2116">'''Systems immunology''' is a recent research field that, under the larger umbrella of [[systems biology]], aims to study the [[immune system]] in the more integrated perspective on how entities and players participate at different system levels to the immune function.

The immune system has been thoroughly analyzed as regards to its components and function by using a very successful "[[reductionist]]" approach, but its overall functioning principles cannot easily be predicted by studying the properties of its isolated components because they strongly rely on and arise from the [[interactions]] among these numerous constituents. Systems immunology represents a different approach for the integrated comprehension of the immune system structure and function based on [[complex systems]] theory, [[high-throughput screening|high-throughput]] techniques, as well as on mathematical and computational tools.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Khan TA, Friedensohn S, de Vries AR, Straszewski J, Ruscheweyh HJ, Reddy ST |title=Accurate and predictive antibody repertoire profiling by molecular amplification fingerprinting |journal=Sci.

'''''The Eerie Silence: Renewing Our Search for Alien Intelligence''''' is a 2010 science text by [[Paul Davies]], chair of the [[SETI]]: Post-Detection Science and Technology Taskgroup of the [[International Academy of Astronautics]]. ''The Eerie Silence'' explores the possibilities of intelligent extraterrestrial life, and its potential consequences.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Davies |first=Paul |title=The Eerie Silence |date=2010 |publisher=[[Houghton Mifflin Harcourt]] |location=Boston, New York |isbn=978-0-547-13324-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Contents==

===Chapter 1: Is Anybody Out There?===

In this chapter, Davies goes over the history of aliens as conceived by humanity, culminating in a discussion about [[SETI]]. He makes the point that SETI is science, despite opposing views in the public. Various possibilities for a [[habitable zone]] are mentioned, and Davies also debunks various [[UFO]] stories.

===Chapter 2: Life: Freak Side-Show or Cosmic Imperative?===

Here, Davies debates the point of whether life is common in the universe. He discusses two opposing viewpoints: that of [[Christian de Duve]], which is that life will inevitably arise on Earth-like planets given enough time, and that of [[Jacques Monod]], which is that life has only arisen once in the universe, on Earth.

===Chapter 3: A Shadow Biosphere===

Davies discusses the possibility of [[shadow biosphere|multiple biospheres]] on Earth which evolved separately from normal life, which would be strong evidence for life being a cosmic imperative. He gives several examples of possible [[shadow life]]forms, as well as various methods to search for them.

===Chapter 4: How Much Intelligence is Out There?===

In this chapter, Davies analyzes the probability of intelligent life arising on an Earth-like planet and communicating with us. His discussion is centered around the [[Drake Equation]].

===Chapter 5: New SETI: Widening the Search===

Davies argues for a new search method for SETI, which would be less anthropocentric but at the same time scientifically eliminating various uninhabitable regions. He also discusses whether or not we have already received signals from extraterrestrials, but have not yet discovered them.

In this chapter, Davies brings up an interesting theory about [[Milankovitch cycles|habitability on the Galactic Plane]]. The theory is as such: the [[Solar system]] moves up and down relative to the Galactic Plane, in a cycle of 62 million years, wandering 230 light years out of the plane as a result. According to Richard Muller and Robert Rohde, this cycle closely matches that of marine extinctions in the past 542 million years. The death rate is highest when the solar system is located at a maximum distance from the galactic plane in the direction of galactic north and lowest when it is down south.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author =Robert A. Rohde|author2 =Richard A. Muller|title=Cycles in fossil diversity|journal=Nature|volume=434|date=2005|pages=208–10|doi=10.1038/nature03339|pmid=15758998|issue=7030|bibcode=2005Natur.434..208R}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An explanation for this has been proposed by Mikhail Medvedev and Adrian Melott. They point out that the galactic halo is not symmetric between north and south. The galaxy emits a wind that consists of protons and other charged particles, creating a cloud that extends into intergalactic space but is lopsided towards the south. These protons make up a large fraction of [[cosmic rays|high energy cosmic rays]] that impact the Earth. The effect is so great that the Earth receives five times more cosmic radiation at its northernmost point relative to the galactic plane compared to its southernmost point. .&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Mikhail V. Medvedev|author2=Adrian L. Melott|title=Do extragalactic cosmic rays induce cycles in fossil diversity?|journal=Astrophysical Journal|volume=664|date=2007|pages=879|doi=10.1086/518757|bibcode=2007ApJ...664..879M|arxiv=astro-ph/0602092}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This lopsided effect exists because the Milky Way travels at a speed of 200 kilometres per second in the direction of the [[Virgo supercluster]] of galaxies, which lie to the galactic north. The [[intergalactic medium]], consisting mostly of ionized hydrogen gas, serves as an impediment, which has deformed the [[galactic halo]] towards the south. When the halo gas meets the interstellar medium, a [[bow shock]] is created. The energy in the shock front is transferred via a magnetic process to protons from both the intergalactic medium and the halo. These are the protons which form the cosmic rays.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Davies |first=Paul |title=The Eerie Silence |date=2010 |publisher=Houghton Mifflin Harcourt |location=Boston, New York |isbn=978-0-547-13324-9 |pages=103–104}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Also in this chapter Davies considers viruses as possible vehicles for interstellar communication which store intelligent messages in their DNA and then 'upload' it into host cells on arrival at inhabited planets. He also speculates that if extraterrestrials visited the Earth in the past, they could gerrymander genomes of some living organisms, what he calls 'genomic SETI'. Even though these methods of communication face great obstacles, primarily because DNA is notoriously mutable, Davies thinks it is worth trying to check that since genome sequencing is performed anyway and genomes are uploaded into Internet, so it costs almost nothing to run the data through a computer to look for suspicious patterns.

===Chapter 6: Evidence for a Galactic Diaspora===

Davies begins by mentioning the [[Fermi Paradox]], and mentions various ways we could find signs of extraterrestrial life tampering with their environments.

===Chapter 7: Alien Magic===

Davies discusses the advanced nature of alien technology, and the problems we might have at distinguishing this technology. Davies characterizes technology as "nature-plus", i.e. it performs the functions of nature in an accelerated manner. Also, he believes that technology has gone through two stages: the manipulation of matter (the [[wheel]], [[steam engine]], etc.) and the manipulation of information ([[computers]], [[phone]]s, etc.).

===Chapter 8: Post-Biological Intelligence===

Davies continues his discussion of alien technology, and comes to the conclusion that extraterrestrial intelligence might not be interested in the physical world at all and would instead take on the form of a quantum computer.

===Chapter 9: First Contact===

Here, Davies talks about the consequences of detecting intelligent aliens, and various reactions from governments, scientists, the media, and religious organizations.

===Chapter 10: Who Speaks for the Earth?===

In this chapter, Davies asks what the best message to send to the aliens is. Finally, he discusses his own viewpoint on the probability of extraterrestrial life, and concludes that, as a scientist, he believes that intelligent aliens are highly unlikely. However, as a human being, he hopes that such aliens in fact exist.

'''''The Theory of Island Biogeography''''' is a 1967 book by [[Robert MacArthur]] and [[Edward O.

==Background==
''The Theory of Island Biogeography'' has its roots in Wilson's work on the ants of [[Melanesia]]. MacArthur synthesized Wilson's ideas about competition, colonization and equilibrium into a simple graphical representation of immigration and extinction curves, from which one can determine the equilibrial species number on an island.&lt;ref name="Wilson_2010"&gt;{{cite book|jstor=j.ctt7s5m6.6|title=The Theory of Island Biogeography Revisited|last=Wilson|first=Edward O. | name-list-format = vanc |date=2010|publisher=Princeton University Press|year=|isbn=9780691136530|editor1-last=Losos|editor1-first=Jonathan B.|pages=1–12|chapter=Island Biogeography in the 1960s|editor2-last=Ricklefs|editor2-first=Robert E.}}&lt;/ref&gt; MacArthur and Wilson's ideas were first presented in a paper published in 1963,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=MacArthur|first=Robert H.|last2=Wilson|first2=Edward O. | name-list-format = vanc |date=1963-12-01|title=An Equilibrium Theory of Insular Zoogeography |journal=Evolution|volume=17|issue=4|pages=373–387|doi=10.1111/j.1558-5646.1963.tb03295.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; and were further developed into a book.&lt;ref name="Wilson_2010" /&gt;

== Summary ==

=== Introduction ===
In the introductory chapter, MacArthur and Wilson highlight the significance of studying island biogeography. Since islands are less complex and more numerous than larger ecosystems, islands provide better opportunities to develop insights and perform replicable field research. Given that insular microcosms are common to all ecosystems, principles from island biogeography can be applied generally.
[[File:Equilibrium_Model_for_Number_of_Species_on_an_Island.png|thumb|This graph portrays the immigration rate of new species and the extinction rate of resident species versus the number of species present on an island. The intersection point gives the equilibrial species number.]]

=== Area-diversity pattern ===
In Chapters 2 and 3, MacArthur and Wilson postulate that insular species richness depends on island size and isolation from source regions. The authors present an equilibrium model that is based on the following concept: when there is an addition of the number of species on an island, the island's immigration rate of new species will decrease while the extinction rate of resident species will increase. MacArthur and Wilson thus assume that there will be an equilibrial point where the immigration rate equals the extinction rate. They further hypothesize that an increase in island size will lower extinction curves while a decrease in distance between the island and the source region will raise immigration curves. Since the intersection of immigration and extinction rate curves determines the species number, the authors predict that larger islands will have more species than smaller islands (assuming these islands are comparably isolated) and isolated islands will have fewer species than islands more proximal to source regions (assuming these islands are equally large). There is additional discourse on how insular clusters and stepping stones affect this model.

=== Modeling colonization and dispersion ===
Chapter 4 discusses survivorship theory. The authors describe a model which states that the probability for successful colonization is dependent on birth rate, death rate, and carrying capacity of the environment. From this model, conclusions are made on the average survival time for a propagule's offspring, the average survival time of a saturated population, and characteristics of successful propagules.

In Chapter 5, MacArthur and Wilson examine why species can be excluded from insular environments and how the [[Ecological niche|niche]] of a species changes after introduction. The authors surmise that pioneering species can be excluded for the following reasons: the island has saturated levels of pre-existing competition, the pioneering species cannot maintain a population large enough to avoid extinction, and the island hosts too many or too few natural predators. When a species colonizes a new area, the authors state that the species will either shift, expand or contract its realized niche.

Chapter 6 is a theoretical exploration of dispersal models. The authors consider how insular stepping stones affect the dispersion of species—particularly, the effects that size and isolation of stepping stones have on dispersion. Further consideration is given to how dispersal curves and average distance travelled by pioneers impacts this study.

In Chapter 7, the authors state that there are generally 3 consecutive phases to the evolution of populations after colonization. Initially, there is a trend for colonizers to evolve from  [[R/K selection theory|r-strategists]]  into [[R/K selection theory|K-strategists]]. The [[founder effect]] may also influence colonizing populations during this first phase. The second phase is marked by long term adaptations to the local environment. In this period, abilities for dispersal are commonly reduced, and colonizers will either differentiate or assimilate with competing species. In the third phase, the evolution of colonizing populations may result in [[speciation]] and/or [[adaptive radiation]].

== Field testing ==
The insular biota equilibrium theory was experimentally tested by E. O. Wilson and his then-graduate student [[Daniel Simberloff]] in six small mangrove islands in the Florida Keys. The islands were fumigated to clear the arthropod populations. Immigration of species onto the island was then observed in a first and second year census. Wilson and Simberloff confirmed that there was an inverse relationship between the number of species on an island and the distance to the source region as predicted in ''The Theory of Island Biogeography''.&lt;ref name="Simberloff2"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Simberloff DS, Wilson EO | date = 1970 | title = Experimental zoogeography of islands.

== Impact ==

=== Applications ===
MacArthur and Wilson's theory of island biogeography has been widely applied outside of island ecosystems. For microbiota, the theory has been applied to the distribution of ectomycorrihzal fungi on trees,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Glassman|first=Sydney I.|last2=Lubetkin|first2=Kaitlin C.|last3=Chung|first3=Judy A.|last4=Bruns|first4=Thomas D. | name-list-format = vanc |date = February 2017 | title=The theory of island biogeography applies to ectomycorrhizal fungi in subalpine tree "islands" at a fine scale |journal=Ecosphere|volume=8|issue=2|pages=e01677|doi=10.1002/ecs2.1677 }}&lt;/ref&gt; the distribution of bacteria in water-filled treeholes,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Bell T, Ager D, Song JI, Newman JA, Thompson IP, Lilley AK, van der Gast CJ | title = Larger islands house more bacterial taxa | journal = Science | volume = 308 | issue = 5730 | pages = 1884 | date = June 2005 | pmid = 15976296 | doi = 10.1126/science.1111318 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and the distribution of fungi among shrubs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Belisle M, Peay KG, Fukami T | title = Flowers as islands: spatial distribution of nectar-inhabiting microfungi among plants of Mimulus aurantiacus, a hummingbird-pollinated shrub | journal = Microbial Ecology | volume = 63 | issue = 4 | pages = 711–8 | date = May 2012 | pmid = 22080257 | pmc = 4108428 | doi = 10.1007/s00248-011-9975-8 }}&lt;/ref&gt; While for flora and fauna, the theory's predictions have been realized with the species richness of plants on mountains&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Riebesell|first=John F. | name-list-format = vanc |date= May 1982 |title=Arctic-Alpine Plants on Mountaintops: Agreement with Island Biogeography Theory |journal=The American Naturalist|volume=119|issue=5|pages=657–674|doi=10.1086/283941 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and with the species richness of aquatic snails in bodies of water.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Lassen HH | title = The diversity of freshwater snails in view of the equilibrium theory of island biogeography | journal = Oecologia | volume = 19 | issue = 1 | pages = 1–8 | date = March 1975 | pmid = 28308826 | doi = 10.1007/bf00377585 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Novel applications looked at plants as islands for insect species&lt;ref&gt;Opler PA (1974).

Insular biogeography: of mice and mites. ''Science''. '''190''' (4213):467-9.&lt;/ref&gt; MacArthur and Wilson's work has been used as a basis in other ecological theories, notably the [[unified neutral theory of biodiversity]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/733057107|title=The unified neutral theory of biodiversity and biogeography | last = Hubbell | first = Stephen P. | name-list-format = vanc |date=2001|publisher=Princeton University Press|isbn=9781400837526|location=Princeton|oclc=733057107}}&lt;/ref&gt; and has been foundational for the fields of [[landscape ecology]], [[invasion biology]], and [[conservation biology]].&lt;ref name="Wilson_2010" /&gt;&lt;ref name="MacArthur_2001" /&gt;

=== Criticism ===
Several studies have disputed the underlying assumptions in MacArthur and Wilson's theory of island biogeography: specifically, the interchangeability of species and islands, the independence between immigration and extinction, and the insignificance of non-equilibrial processes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Brown|first=James H.|last2=Lomolino|first2=Mark V. | name-list-format = vanc |date = January 2000 |title=Concluding remarks: historical perspective and the future of island biogeography theory |journal=Global Ecology and Biogeography|volume=9|issue=1|pages=87–92|doi=10.1046/j.1365-2699.2000.00186.x|issn=1466-822X}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 2001 preface, Wilson stated that "the flaws of the book lie in its oversimplification and incompleteness".&lt;ref name="MacArthur_2001" /&gt;

=== Legacy ===

In 2007, a symposium was held at Harvard University honoring the fortieth anniversary of ''The Theory of Island Biogeography''.&lt;ref name="Wilson_2010" /&gt; Following this conference, a collection of papers was published in the book ''The Theory of Island Biogeography Revisited''.&lt;ref name="Wilson_2010" /&gt;

'''Transtheism''' is a term coined by either philosopher [[Paul Tillich]] or [[Indology|Indologist]] [[Heinrich Zimmer]]&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;In published writings, the term appears in 1952 for Tillich and in 1953 for Zimmer. Since the two men were personally acquainted, it is difficult to say which of them coined the term. Note that the term ''transtheism'' is avoided by both.&lt;/ref&gt; referring to a system of thought or [[religious philosophy]] which is neither [[theism|theistic]], nor [[atheism|atheistic]], but is beyond them.

Zimmer applies the term to the theological system of [[Jainism]], which is theistic in the limited sense that the gods exist, but become irrelevant as they are transcended by ''[[moksa (Jainism)|moksha]]'' (that is, a system which is not [[non-theistic]], but in which the gods are not the highest spiritual instance). Zimmer (1953, p.&amp;nbsp;182) uses the term to describe the position of the [[Tirthankara]]s having passed "beyond the godly governors of the natural order".

The term has more recently also been applied to [[Buddhism]],&lt;ref&gt;Antonio Rigopoulos, The Life and Teachings of Sai Baba of Shirdi (1993), p. 372; J. L. (Ed) Houlden, Jesus: The Complete Guide (2005), p. 390&lt;/ref&gt; [[Advaita Vedanta]]&lt;ref&gt;Steven T. Katz, Mysticism and Sacred Scripture, Oxford University Press (2000), p. 177 ; Pulasth Soobah. Roodurmun, Kanshi Ram, Bhāmatī and Vivaraṇa Schools of Advaita Vedānta, Motilal Banarsidass (2002), p. 172&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Bhakti]] movement.&lt;ref&gt;Werner Karel, Love Divine: Studies in Bhakti and Devotional Mysticism (1993), p. 153&lt;/ref&gt;

==Terminology==
Nathan Katz in ''Buddhist and Western Philosophy'' (1981, p.&amp;nbsp;446) points out that the term "transpolytheistic" would be more accurate, since it entails that the polytheistic [[deity|gods]] are not denied or rejected even after the development of a notion of the [[Absolute (philosophy)|Absolute]] that transcends them, but criticizes the classification as characterizing the mainstream by the periphery: "like categorizing Roman Catholicism as a good example of non-[[Nestorianism]]". The term is indeed informed by the fact that the corresponding development in the West, the development of [[monotheism]], did not "transcend" polytheism, but abolish it, while in the mainstream of the [[Indian religions]], the notion of "gods" ([[deva (Hinduism)|deva]]) was never elevated to the status of "God" or [[Ishvara]], or the impersonal Absolute [[Brahman]], but adopted roles comparable to Western [[angel]]s. "Transtheism", according to the criticism of Katz, is then an artifact of [[comparative religion]].

[[Paul Tillich]] uses ''transtheistic'' in ''The Courage to Be'' (1952), as an aspect of [[Stoicism]]. Tillich stated that Stoicism and [[Neo-Stoicism]]
&lt;blockquote&gt;are the way in which some of the noblest figures in later antiquity and their followers in modern times have answered the problem of existence and conquered the anxieties of fate and death. Stoicism in this sense is a basic religious attitude, whether it appears in theistic, atheistic, or transtheistic forms.&lt;ref&gt;''Writings on Religion'', Walter de Gruyter (1988), p. 145.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Like Zimmer trying to express a religious notion that  is neither theistic nor atheistic. However, the theism that is being transcended in Stoicism according to Tillich is not polytheism as in Jainism, but [[monotheism]], pursuing an ideal of human [[courage]] which has emancipated itself from God.

&lt;blockquote&gt;
The courage to take meaninglessness into itself presupposes a relation to the ground of being which we have called "absolute faith." It is without a special content, yet it is not without content. The content of absolute faith is the "god above God." Absolute faith and its consequence, the courage that takes the radical doubt, the doubt about God, into itself, transcends the theistic idea of God.&lt;ref&gt;Paul Tillich. Theism Transcended (Yale: CT 1952) 185-190, in the Courage to Be, in the Essential Tillich: an anthology of the writings of Paul Tillich, ed. F. Forrester Church (Macmillan: NY 1987) 187-190&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[Martin Buber]] criticized Tillich's "transtheistic position" as a reduction of God to the impersonal "necessary being" of [[Thomas Aquinas]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|first=David |last= Novak |author-link = David Novak |title= Buber and Tillich | journal= Journal of Ecumenical Studies | volume=29 | number=2 | date= Spring 1992 | pages= 159–74 |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=xnXMiBAXVZkC&amp;pg=PA89&amp;lpg=PA89&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=1dCPvQYkYj&amp;sig=zQOeKFy9pcqBhUyemnT98NYrDhc&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=MfKzUebyJsrP0wHRnIGwBQ&amp;ved=0CEgQ6AEwAw#v=onepage&amp;q=transtheistic%20position&amp;f=false}} &lt;br /&gt; As reprinted in: {{citation | title= Talking With Christians: Musings of A Jewish Theologian| year= 2005 | publisher= Wm.

== Buddhism as transtheistic ==
Following the term coined by the philosophers Tillich and Zimmer, Buddhism can be regarded as a transtheistic religion&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;. This can be evident by the transcendence of the state of [[Nirvana (Buddhism)|Nibbana]] (Nirvana) that surpasses all the realms of existence, including the planes of [[Deva (Buddhism)|devas]] and [[Brahmā (Buddhism)|brahmas]] who are considered gods in [[Buddhist cosmology]]. The historical Buddha made it clear that the path to enlightenment does not depend on a god or gods. Although there is acknowledgment of a multitude of gods in the oldest Buddhist scriptures, there is also reference to Maha Brahma, who considered himself to be the all-powerful all-creator god, only to be critiqued by the Buddha as having wrongly perceived his plane of existence as the highest.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.accesstoinsight.org/lib/authors/jootla/wheel414.html|title=Teacher of the Devas|website=www.accesstoinsight.org|language=en|access-date=2018-01-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Vision span''' or '''perceptual span''' is a controversial concept referring to the angular span (vertically and horizontally), within which  the [[human eye]] has sharp enough [[Visual perception|vision]] to perform an action accurately (reading or face recognition). The [[visual field]] of the human eye spans approximately 120&amp;nbsp;[[Degree (angle)|degrees of arc]].  However, most of that arc is [[peripheral vision]]. The human eye has much greater [[Optical resolution|resolution]] in the [[macula]], where there is a higher density of [[cone cell]]s. The [[field of view]] that is observed with sufficient resolution to read text typically spans about 6&amp;nbsp;degrees of arc, which is wide enough to allow a clear view of about five words in a row when printed text at ordinary size is held about 50&amp;nbsp;centimeters from the eyes. Regarding face processing, the [[field of view]] with a sufficient amount of information in order to recognise faces accurately spans about 7° which represents about 45% of a face.&lt;ref name=FS&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1167/17.5.16 |pmid=28549354 |title=The Facespan—the perceptual span for face recognition |journal=Journal of Vision |volume=17 |issue=5 |pages=16 |year=2017 |last1=Papinutto |first1=Michael |last2=Lao |first2=Junpeng |last3=Ramon |first3=Meike |last4=Caldara |first4=Roberto |last5=Miellet |first5=Sébastien }}&lt;/ref&gt; The brain creates the illusion of having a greater visual span by automatically and unconsciously moving the center of vision into any area of interest in the field of view.

==Application to speed reading==

While reading, readers will fail to recognize a word unless they are fixating within three to four character spaces of the word.&lt;ref name=Rayner1975&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/0010-0285(75)90005-5 |title=The perceptual span and peripheral cues in reading |journal=Cognitive Psychology |volume=7 |issue=4 |pages=65–81 |year=1975 |last1=Rayner |first1=Keith |bibcode=1992CogPs..24..535V }}&lt;/ref&gt; The same is true for [[speed reading|speed readers]] and [[Skimming (reading)|skimmers]].  Speed readers cannot answer questions about a main point or detail, if they did not fixate directly on it or within three character spaces of it (Just and Carpenter 1987).  When a text is removed whilst reading, readers can only accurately report upon the word they were fixating upon or the next one to the right (McConkie and Hogaoam 1985).  There is no evidence from eye movement research that individuals are making predictions of text based upon hypotheses about the words in the periphery so that they can skip over or spend less time on unimportant or redundant words.&lt;ref name=Rayner1975/&gt;

Most speed reading courses claim that the peripheral vision can be used to read text. This has been suggested impossible because the text is blurred out through lack of visual resolution.  At best the human brain can only ''guess'' at the content of text outside the macular region. There simply are not enough cone cells away from the center of the visual field to identify words in the periphery of the field.

It has been suggested that the fixation span can be stretched through training ([[meta guiding]]) to take in as much as a line for the purpose of skimming or speed reading.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|pmc = 2729064|year = 2007|last1 = Legge|first1 = G. E|title = The case for the visual span as a sensory bottleneck in reading|journal = Journal of Vision|volume = 7|issue = 2|pages = 9.1–915|last2 = Cheung|first2 = S. H|last3 = Yu|first3 = D|last4 = Chung|first4 = S. T|last5 = Lee|first5 = H. W|last6 = Owens|first6 = D. P|pmid = 18217824|doi = 10.1167/7.2.9}}&lt;/ref&gt; However other sources suggest that using this method can result in a severely reduced comprehension rate in comparison to normal reading ("[[rauding]]").

Some speed reading courses stress that the human eye has to move very quickly.  They also stress that the human eye should move in a pattern to fill in the information that was not properly perceived.  The effective limit for [[wikt:scan|scan]]ning speeds based upon the limit of the human eye's resolution is about 300 words per minute.&lt;ref&gt;http://skepdic.com/speedreading.html{{full citation needed|date=August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It is claimed that such speeds also require great practice, and extremely rapid eye movements, although research suggests that such training is not possible.  It has been suggested by some speed reading promoters that the readers who achieve such speeds are on the [[autism spectrum]].  Research into reading rate suggests that study strategies, rather than speed reading, explains why expert readers, such as professors and editors, are more efficient than others.

==Application to face processing==

Face recognition system requires several fixation on different location (typically in a triangular pattern) for a face to be recognised. The same is true for the so-called Super Recognisers who are persons with high face recognition capabilities. Similarly to the reading span, the Facespan might be modulated by difficulty,&lt;ref&gt;http://psycnet.apa.org/buy/1990-18858-001{{full citation needed|date=August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; expertise,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.3758/PBR.17.6.834 |pmid=21169577 |title=Eye movements, the perceptual span, and reading speed |journal=Psychonomic Bulletin &amp; Review |volume=17 |issue=6 |pages=834 |year=2010 |last1=Rayner |first1=Keith |last2=Slattery |first2=Timothy J |last3=Bélanger |first3=Nathalie N |pmc=3075059 }}&lt;/ref&gt; age,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/0022-0965(86)90037-8 |pmid=3701249 |title=Eye movements and the perceptual span in beginning and skilled readers |journal=Journal of Experimental Child Psychology |volume=41 |issue=2 |pages=211–36 |year=1986 |last1=Rayner |first1=Keith }}&lt;/ref&gt; disorder &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1007/BF02648003 |title=Eye movements, perceptual span, and reading disability |journal=Annals of Dyslexia |volume=33 |pages=163–173 |year=1983 |last1=Rayner |first1=Keith }}&lt;/ref&gt; and other idiosyncratic differences between individuals. The idiosyncratic differences are thus most probably due to differences in Facespan rather than in oculomotor strategy. Previous study revealed that the Vision span is more accurately defined in number of characters rather than in visual angle.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1111/j.1467-9280.2009.02364.x |pmid=19470124 |title=Parafoveal Magnification |journal=Psychological Science |volume=20 |issue=6 |pages=721–8 |year=2009 |last1=Miellet |first1=Sébastien |last2=O'Donnell |first2=Patrick J |last3=Sereno |first3=Sara C }}&lt;/ref&gt;
