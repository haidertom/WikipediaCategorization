      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10559">The '''Albertina Foundation''' ([[Danish language|Danish]]: Legatet Albertina) was a philanthropic foundation created by [[Carl Jacobsen]] in 1879 with  the aim of installing sculpture in the public realm, particularly in the parks, of [[Copenhagen]], [[Denmark]]. The artworks include both casts of classical Roman and Greek statues and works by contemporary artists. The foundation is named after [[Bertel Thorvaldsen]], who in Italy went by the name of Alberto.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.denstoredanske.dk/Samfund,_jura_og_politik/Samfund/Legater_og_fonde/Albertina|title=Albertina|publisher=Gyldendal|accessdate=2012-05-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The foundation was established on [[1879 on Denmark|19 October 1879]]. It was administrated by a board consisting of the founder and two other members appointed by the City Council and the [[Royal Danish Academy of Fine Arts|Art Academy]] respectively. From the beginning, there were disagreements on the board as to what artworks to acquire. Jacobsen wanted contemporary French art while [[Ferdinand Meldahl]], who represented the City Council, leaned towards Danish artists. As a compromise, 14 of the 15 sculptures which the foundation acquired during the first ten years of its existence were castings of classical works.&lt;ref name=Albertina-Gistory&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ny-carlsbergfondet.dk/pdf/aar2004/Kap_XVI.pdf|title=Legatet Albertina|publisher=Carlsberg Foundation|accessdate=2012-05-26|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060108200927/http://www.ny-carlsbergfondet.dk/pdf/aar2004/Kap_XVI.pdf|archive-date=2006-01-08|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When Carl Jacobsen died in 1914, his oldest son, Holger Jacobsen, took over his seat on the board. Gradually, due to inflation, acquisitions dwindled. The foundation was finally dissolved on [[2002 in Denmark|19 November 2002]], after 123 years of operations. The last funds were spent on [[Jørn Larsen]]'s water feature on [[Bertel Thorvaldsens Plads]] in front of [[Thorvaldsens Museum]].&lt;ref name=Albertina-Gistory/&gt;

{{Ancient Egyptian culture}}
'''Ancient Egyptian architecture''' is the architecture of one of the most influential civilizations throughout history, which developed a vast array of diverse structures and great architectural monuments along the [[Nile]], including [[Egyptian pyramids|pyramids]] and [[Egyptian temple|temples]].

==Characteristics==
Due to the scarcity of wood,&lt;ref&gt;R. G. Blakemore, ''History of Interior Design and Furniture: From Ancient Egypt to Nineteenth-Century Europe'', John Wiley and Sons 1996, p.100&lt;/ref&gt; the two predominant building materials used in ancient Egypt were sun-baked [[mud brick]] and [[Rock (geology)|stone]], mainly limestone, but also sandstone and granite in considerable quantities.&lt;ref&gt;Blakemore, 1996, p.107&lt;/ref&gt; From the [[Old Kingdom]] onward, stone was generally reserved for [[tomb]]s and [[Egyptian temple|temples]], while bricks were used even for royal palaces, fortresses, the walls of temple precincts and towns, and for subsidiary buildings in temple complexes. The core of the [[pyramid]]s consisted of locally quarried stone, mudbricks, sand or gravel. For the casing stones were used that had to be transported from farther away, predominantly white limestone from Tura and red granite from upper Egypt.

[[File:Lepsius-Projekt tw 1-2-108.jpg|thumb|260px|left|Drawings of the types of the architectural [[Capital (architecture)|capitals]] specific for the Ancient Egyptian civilization.]]

Ancient Egyptian houses were made out of mud collected from the damp banks of the Nile river. It was placed in moulds and left to dry in the hot sun to harden for use in construction. If the bricks were intended to be used in a royal tomb like a  pyramid, the exterior bricks would also be finely chiselled and polished.

Many Egyptian towns have disappeared because they were situated near the cultivated area of the Nile Valley and were flooded as the river bed slowly rose during the millennia, or the mud bricks of which they were built were used by peasants as fertilizer. Others are inaccessible, new buildings having been erected on ancient ones. However, the dry, hot climate of Egypt preserved some mud brick structures. Examples include the village [[Deir al-Madinah]], the Middle Kingdom town at [[El-Lahun|Kahun]],&lt;ref&gt;W. M. Flinders Petrie, ''Kahun, Gurob, and Hawara'', Kegan Paul, Trench, Trübner, and Co., London 1890&lt;/ref&gt; and the fortresses at [[Buhen]]&lt;ref&gt;Charles Gates, ''Ancient Cities: The Archaeology of Urban Life in the Ancient Near East and Egypt, Greece and Rome'', Routledge 2003, p.101&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Mirgissa]]. Also, many temples and tombs have survived because they were built on high ground unaffected by the Nile flood and were constructed of stone.

Thus, our understanding of ancient Egyptian architecture is based mainly on religious monuments,&lt;ref&gt;Dieter Arnold, Byron Esely Shafer ''Temples of Ancient Egypt'', I.B.Tauris, 2005&lt;/ref&gt; massive structures characterized by thick, sloping walls with few openings, possibly echoing a method of construction used to obtain stability in mud walls. In a similar manner, the incised and flatly modeled surface adornment of the stone buildings may have derived from mud wall ornamentation. Although the use of the [[arch]] was developed during the [[Fourth dynasty of Egypt|fourth dynasty]], all monumental buildings are [[post and lintel]] constructions, with flat roofs constructed of huge stone blocks supported by the external walls and the closely spaced columns.

Exterior and interior walls, as well as the [[column]]s and [[pier (architecture)|piers]], were covered with [[Egyptian hieroglyphs|hieroglyphic]] and pictorial frescoes and carvings painted in brilliant colors.&lt;ref&gt;Blakemore, 1996, pp.107ff.&lt;/ref&gt; Many motifs of Egyptian ornamentation are [[symbol]]ic, such as the [[Dung beetle#Scarab in ancient Egypt|scarab]], or sacred beetle, the [[solar disk]], and the [[vulture]]. Other common motifs include [[palm tree|palm]] leaves, the [[papyrus]] plant, and the buds and flowers of the [[Nymphaea caerulea|lotus]].&lt;ref&gt;Arnold, 2005, pp.204ff&lt;/ref&gt; [[Egyptian hieroglyphs|Hieroglyphs]] were inscribed for decorative purposes as well as to record historic events or spells. In addition, these pictorial frescoes and carvings allow us to understand how the Ancient Egyptians lived, statuses, wars that were fought and their beliefs. This was especially true when exploring the tombs of Ancient Egyptian officials in recent years.

Ancient Egyptian temples were aligned with astronomically significant events, such as [[solstice]]s and [[equinox]]es, requiring precise measurements at the moment of the particular event. Measurements at the most significant temples may have been ceremonially undertaken by the [[Pharaoh]] himself.&lt;ref&gt;"Temples aligned with the stars", ''New Scientist'' 2724 (5 Sep. 2009), p. 7; see also J. Belmonte &amp; M. Shaltout, "Keeping Ma’at: an astronomical approach to the orientation of the temples in ancient Egypt", ''Advances in Space Research'' (August 2009) {{doi|10.1016/j.asr.2009.03.033}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Giza pyramid complex==
{{Main|Giza pyramid complex}}
The Giza Necropolis stands on the [[Giza Plateau]], on the outskirts of [[Cairo]], [[Egypt]]. This complex of ancient monuments is located some 8 kilometers (5&amp;nbsp;mi) inland into the desert from the old town of [[Giza]] on the Nile, some 20 kilometers (12&amp;nbsp;mi) southwest of Cairo city center. This [[Ancient Egypt]]ian [[necropolis]] consists of the [[Pyramid of Khufu]] (also known as the ''[[Great Pyramid of Giza|Great Pyramid]]'' and the ''Pyramid of Cheops''), the somewhat smaller [[Pyramid of Khafre]] (or Kephren/Chefren), and the relatively modest-sized [[Pyramid of Menkaure]] (or Mykerinus/Mycerinus), along with a number of smaller satellite edifices, known as "queens" pyramids, the [[Great Sphinx]] as well as a few hundred mastabas, and chapels.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Winston|first=Alan|title=An overview of the Giza Plateau in Egypt|url=http://www.touregypt.net/featurestories/giza.htm|accessdate=26 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:All Gizah Pyramids.jpg|thumb|300px|The Pyramids of Giza]]
The pyramids, which were built in the Fourth Dynasty, testify to the power of the pharaonic religion and state. They were built to serve both as grave sites and also as a way to make their names last forever.&lt;ref name="Reich 2010"&gt;{{cite book|last=Reich|first=Lawrence S. Cunningham, John J.|title=Culture and values : a survey of the humanities|year=2010|publisher=Wadsworth Cengage Learning|location=Boston, MA|isbn=0-495-56877-5|edition=7th}}&lt;/ref&gt; The size and simple design show the high skill level of Egyptian design and engineering on a large scale.&lt;ref name="Reich 2010"/&gt; The [[Great Pyramid of Giza]], which was probably completed c. 2580 BC, is the oldest of the Giza pyramids and the largest pyramid in the world, and is the only surviving monument of the [[Seven Wonders of the Ancient World]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The 7 Wonders of the Ancient World |url=http://library.thinkquest.org/C0123829/ |accessdate=26 July 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110808170642/http://library.thinkquest.org/C0123829/ |archivedate=8 August 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The pyramid of Khafre is believed to have been completed around [[2532 BC]], at the end of Khafre's reign.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Lehner|first=Mark|title=The Pyramid of Khafre|url=http://puffin.creighton.edu/museums/cohagan/giza_khafre.htm|work=The Complete Pyramids|accessdate=26 July 2011| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20110728213057/http://puffin.creighton.edu/museums/cohagan/giza_khafre.htm| archivedate= 28 July 2011 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; Khafre ambitiously placed his pyramid next to his fathers. It is not as tall as his father's pyramid but he was able to give it the impression of appearing taller by building it on a site with a foundation 33 feet (10 m) higher than his father's.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Lehner|first=Mark|title=The Pyramid of Khafre|url=http://puffin.creighton.edu/museums/cohagan/giza_khafre.htm|work=The Complete Pyramids|accessdate=26 July 2011| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20110728213057/http://puffin.creighton.edu/museums/cohagan/giza_khafre.htm| archivedate= 28 July 2011 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; Along with building his pyramid, Chefren commissioned the building of the giant Sphinx as guardian over his tomb. The face of a human, possibly a depiction of the pharaoh, on a lion's body was seen as a symbol of [[divinity]] among the Greeks fifteen hundred years later.&lt;ref name="Reich 2010"/&gt; The Great Sphinx is carved out of the limestone bedrock and stands about 65 feet (20 m) tall.&lt;ref name="Reich 2010"/&gt; Menkaure's pyramid dates to circa 2490 BC and stands 213 feet (65 m) high making it the smallest of the Great Pyramids.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Pyramid of Mankaure|url=http://www.nationalgeographic.com/pyramids/menkaure.html|work=National Geographic: Egypt|publisher=National Geographic Society|accessdate=26 July 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111002191314/http://www.nationalgeographic.com/pyramids/menkaure.html|archive-date=2 October 2011|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Popular culture leads people to believe that Pyramids are highly confusing, with many tunnels within the pyramid to create confusion for grave robbers. This is not true. The shafts of pyramids are quite simple, mostly leading directly to the tomb. The immense size of the pyramids attracted robbers to the wealth that lay inside which caused the tombs to be robbed relatively soon after the tomb was sealed in some cases.&lt;ref name="Reich 2010"/&gt; There are sometimes additional tunnels, but these were used for the builders to understand how far they could dig the tomb into the crust of the Earth. Also, it is popularly thought that due to grave robbers, future Kings were buried in the Valley of the Kings to help keep them hidden. This is also false, as the Pyramid construction continued for many Dynasties, just on a smaller scale. Finally, the pyramid construction was stopped due to economic factors, not theft.

Evidence suggests that they were built by paid laborers and craftsmen that were well cared for and not by slaves.

==New Kingdom Temples==

=== Luxor Temple ===
{{Main|Luxor Temple}}
The Luxor Temple is a huge ancient Egyptian temple complex located on the east bank of the [[Nile|River Nile]] in the city today known as [[Luxor]] (ancient [[Thebes (Egypt)|Thebes]]). Construction work on the temple began during the reign of [[Amenhotep III]] in the 14th century BC. [[Horemheb]] and [[Tutankhamun]] added columns, statues, and friezes&amp;nbsp;– and [[Akhenaten]] had earlier obliterated his father's [[cartouche]]s and installed a shrine to the [[Aten]]&amp;nbsp;– but the only major expansion effort took place under [[Ramesses II]] some 100 years after the first stones were put in place. Luxor is thus unique among the main Egyptian temple complexes in having only two pharaohs leave their mark on its architectural structure.

[[File:Egypt.LuxorTemple.06.jpg|right|thumb|200px|Luxor Temple, from the east bank of the Nile]]
The temple proper begins with the {{convert|24|m|abbr=on}} high First [[Pylon (architecture)|Pylon]], built by Ramesses II. The pylon was decorated with scenes of Ramesses's military triumphs (particularly the [[Battle of Qadesh]]); later pharaohs, particularly those of the [[Nubia]]n and [[Ethiopia]]n dynasties, also recorded their victories there. This main entrance to the temple complex was originally flanked by six colossal statues of Ramesses&amp;nbsp;– four seated, and two standing&amp;nbsp;– but only two (both seated) have survived. Modern visitors can also see a {{convert|25|m|abbr=on}} tall pink granite [[obelisk]]: this one of a matching pair until 1835, when the other one was taken to [[Paris]] where it now stands in the centre of the [[Place de la Concorde]].

Through the pylon gateway leads into a [[peristyle]] courtyard, also built by Ramesses II. This area, and the pylon, were built at an oblique angle to the rest of the temple, presumably to accommodate the three pre-existing barque shrines located in the northwest corner. After the peristyle courtyard comes the processional colonnade built by Amenhotep III&amp;nbsp;– a {{convert|100|m|abbr=on}} corridor lined by 14 [[papyrus]]-[[capital (architecture)|capital]] columns. Friezes on the wall describe the stages in the Opet Festival, from sacrifices at Karnak at the top left, through [[Amun]]'s arrival at Luxor at the end of that wall, and concluding with his return on the opposite side. The decorations were put in place by Tutankhamun: the boy pharaoh is depicted, but his names have been replaced with those of Horemheb.

Beyond the colonnade is a peristyle courtyard, which also dates back to Amenhotep's original construction. The best preserved columns are on the eastern side, where some traces of original color can be seen. The southern side of this courtyard is made up of a 36-column [[hypostyle]] court (i.e., a roofed space supported by columns) that leads into the dark inner rooms of the temple.

=== Temple of Karnak ===
{{Main|Karnak}}
[[File:KarnakVisitorCenterModel.jpg|thumb|A recreation of the temple complex at Karnak visiting center.]]
The temple complex of Karnak is located on the banks of the Nile River some 2.5 kilometers (1.5&amp;nbsp;mi) north of [[Luxor]]. It consists of four main parts, the [[Precinct of Amon-Re]], the [[Precinct of Montu]], the [[Precinct of Mut]] and the [[Temple of Amenhotep IV]] (dismantled), as well as a few smaller temples and sanctuaries located outside the enclosing walls of the four main parts, and several avenues of ram-headed sphinxes connecting the Precinct of Mut, the Precinct of Amon-Re and Luxor Temple. This temple complex is particularly significant, for many rulers have added to it. However, notably every ruler of the New Kingdom added to it. The site covers over 200 acres and consists of a series of pylons, leading into courtyards, halls, chapels, obelisks, and smaller temples. The key difference between Karnak and most of the other temples and sites in Egypt is the length of time over which it was developed and used. Construction work began in the 16th century BC, and was originally quite modest in size. But eventually, in the main precinct alone, as many as twenty temples and chapels would be constructed.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Complete Temples of Ancient Egypt|last=Wilkinson|first=R.|publisher=New York, Thames &amp; Hudson|year=2000|isbn=|location=|pages=154}}&lt;/ref&gt; Approximately 30 pharaohs contributed to the buildings, enabling it to reach a size, complexity and diversity not seen elsewhere. Few of the individual features of Karnak are unique, but the size and number of those features is overwhelming.[[File:Luxor Karnak-Tempel 2016-03-21 Große Säulenhalle 04.jpg|thumb|Example of the inscriptions present throughout the complex. As visible from this image, the upper regions are painted, suggesting (in cannon with other such temples) that the remain  columns and ceilings would have been brightly painted. The temple roof representing the heavens&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Architecture, Astronomy and Sacred Landscape in Ancient Egypt|last=Gulio|first=Magli|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=2013|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; would often display images of stars and birds, whereas the columns often boast images of palm plants, lotus and people.]]One of the greatest temples in Egyptian history is that of Amun-Ra at Karnak. As with many other temples in Egypt, this one details the feats of the past (including thousands of years of history detailed via inscriptions on many of the walls and columns found on site, often modified or completely erased and redone by following rulers), and honors the gods. The temple of Amun-Re was constructed in three sections, the third being constructed by the later New Kingdom pharaohs. In cannon with the traditional style of Egyptian architecture, many of the architectural features, such as the inner sanctum of the complex, were aligned with the sunset of the summer solstice.

One of the architectural features present at the site is the 5,000 sq m (50,000 sq ft) hypostyle hall built during the Ramesside period. The hall is supported by approximately 139 sandstone and mud brick columns, with 12 central columns (~69 feet tall) that would have all been brightly painted.

=== Temple Ramesseum ===
[[File:Egypt.Ramesseum.02.jpg|thumb|The design of Ramesses's mortuary temple adheres to the standard style of New Kingdom temple architecture. Oriented northwest and southeast, the temple entrance consists of a number of stone figures, one located horizontally to the next. In the center area of the complex was a covered 48-column hypostyle hall, surrounding the inner sanctuary.]]
Ramses II, a 19th Dynasty pharaoh ruled Egypt from around 1279 to 1213 BCE. Among Ramses II many accomplishments, such as the expanding of the Egyptian borders, he constructed a massive temple called the Ramesseum. The temple is located near the city of Thebes, which at the time was the capital for the New kingdom pharaoh. The Ramesseum was a magnificent temple, completed with monument status to guard its entrance; the most impressive of which was a 62 foot tall statue of Ramses himself.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The encyclopaedia of ancient Egyptian architecture|last=Dieter|first=Arnold|publisher=I.B. Tauris|year=2003|isbn=1-86064-465-1|location=|pages=196}}&lt;/ref&gt; Only fragments of this structure remain, particularly its base and torso are all that remain of the this impressive statue of the enthroned pharaoh, and thus the dimensions and weight (approximately 1000 pounds) are based on estimates. The temple was also accompanied with impressive reliefs many of which detail a number of Rames' military victories, such as the [[Battle of Kadesh]] (ca. 1274 BC) and the pillaging of the city "Shalem".

=== Temple of Malkata ===
Under the tenure of Amenhotep III workers constructed over 250 buildings and monuments. One of the most impressive building projects was the temple complex of Malkata, known among the ancient Egyptians as the “house of rejoicing”, was constructed to serve his royal residence on the west bank of Thebes, just south of the Theban necropolis. The site is approximately 226,000 square meters (or 2,432,643 square feet).&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Koltsida|first=Aikaterini|date=2007|title=A Dark Spot in Ancient Egyptian Architecture: The Temple of Malkata|url=|journal=Journal of the American Research Center in Egypt|volume=43|pages=43–57|via=Jstor}}&lt;/ref&gt; Given the immense size of the site, along with its many buildings, courts, parade grounds, and housing, it is considered to have served not just as a temple and dwelling of the Pharaoh but a town.

The central area of the complex consisted in the Pharaoh's apartments that were made up of a number of rooms and courts, all of which were oriented around a columned banquet hall. Accompanying the apartments, that presumably housed the royal cohort and foreign guests, was a large throne room connected to smaller chambers, for storage, waiting, and smaller audiences. The greater elements of this area of the complex are what have been come to be called the West Villas (just west of the King's Palace), the North Palace and Village, and Temple.
[[File:Reconstruction of Wall Decoration from the Temple of Amun at Malqata MET 17.10.1a.jpg|thumb|The faience (glazed ceramic earthenware) tile (above) is a reconstruction of wall decoration fragments found at the Temple of Malkata in stacks at the southwest corner.&lt;ref name="metmuseum.org"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.metmuseum.org/art/collection/search/551605|title=Reconstruction of Geometric Decoration|last=|first=|date=|website=Metropolitan Museum of Art|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The gold spirals here were painted with gold paint, whereas the originals would have probably been covered by gold foil. Notably, similar patterns are found in the Pharaoh's Palace.&lt;ref name="metmuseum.org"/&gt;]]
The temple's external dimensions are approximately 183.5 by 110.5 m, and consists of two parts: the large forecourt and the temple proper.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The large front court is 131.5 by 105.5 m, oriented on the east-west axis, and occupies the east part of the temple complex.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The western part of the court is on a higher level and is divided from the rest of the court by a low retaining wall. The lower court is almost square, whereas the upper terrace was rectangular in shape. The upper section of the court was paved with mud bricks and has a 4 m wide entrance to it from the lower part of the fore-court, connecting the base to the upper landing was a ramp enclosed by walls.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; This ramp and entrance were both at the center of the temple, with the same orientation as the front court entrance and the temple proper.

The temple proper might be seen as divided in to three distinct parts: central, north, and south. The central part is indicated by a small rectangular anteroom (6.5 by 3.5 m), many of the door jambs including those of the antechamber include inscriptions, such as 'given life like Ra forever'.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; A 12.5 by 14.5 m hall follows the anteroom from which is entered via a 3.5 m wide door in the center of the front wall of the hall. There is evidence the ceiling of this chamber was decorated with yellow stars on blue background, whereas the walls today show only the appearance of a white stucco over mud plaster.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Notwithstanding, we might speculate given the numerous decorative plaster fragments found within the room's deposit that these too were ornately decorated with various images and patterns. Supporting the ceiling are six columns arranged in two rows with east-west axis. Only small fragments of the column bases have survived, though they suggest the diameter of these columns to have been about 2.25 m.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The columns are placed 2.5 m away from the walls and in each row the columns are approximately 1.4 m away from the next, while the space between the two rows is 3 m.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; A second hall (12.5 by 10 m&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;) is accessed by a 3 m door at the center of the back wall of the first. The second hall is similar to the first, first its ceiling seems to have been decorated with similar if not identical patterns and images as the first. Second, in the same way the ceiling is supported by columns, four to be precise, ordered in two rows on the same axis as those of the first hall, with a 3 m wide space between them. In hall two, at-least one of the rooms appears to have been dedicated to the cult of Maat, which suggests the other three in this area might have likewise served such a religious purpose.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The southern part of the temple may be divided into two sections: western and southern. The western section consists of 6 rooms, whereas the southern area given its size (19.5 by 17.2 m) suggests it might have served as another open court. In many of these rooms were found blue ceramic tiles inlaid with gold around their edge.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The Northern part of the temple proper consists of ten rooms, similar in style to those of the southern.

The temple itself seems to have been dedicated to the Egyptian deity Amun, given the number of bricks stamped with various inscriptions, such as "the temple of Amun in the house of Rejoicing" or "Nebmaarta in the Temple of Amun in the house of Rejoicing". Overall the temple of Malakata shares many with other cult temples of the New Kingdom, with magnificent halls and religiously oriented rooms with many others more closely resemble store rooms.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Lansing|first=Ambrose|date=1918|title=Excavations at the Palace of Amenhotep III at Thebes|url=|journal=The Metropolitan Museum of Art Bulletin|volume=13|pages=|via=Jstor}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Ancient Egyptian Fortresses ==
Fortifications within Ancient Egypt were built in times of conflict between rival principalities.&lt;ref name=":022"&gt;Lawrence, A. (1965). Ancient Egyptian Fortifications. ''The Journal of Egyptian Archaeology,51''(1), 69-94.&lt;/ref&gt; Out of all fortresses analyzed within this time frame, most (if not all) were built of the same materials. The only exception to the rule were some fortresses from the [[Old Kingdom of Egypt|Old Kingdom]] as fortresses such as the fort of [[Buhen]] utilized stone with the creation of its walls. The main walls were mainly built with mud brick but were reinforced with other materials such as timber. Rocks were also utilized to not only preserve them from erosion as well as paving.&lt;ref name=":022" /&gt;  Secondary walls would be built outside of fortresses main walls and were relatively close to one another. As a result, this would prove to be a challenge to invaders were as they forced to destroy this fortification before they could reach the main walls of the fort.&lt;ref name=":12"&gt;Clarke, S. (1916). ANCIENT EGYPTIAN FRONTIER FORTRESSES. ''Journal of Egyptian Archaeology,'' ''3'', 155.&lt;/ref&gt; Another strategy was utilized if the enemy managed to break through the first barrier. Upon making it to the main wall, a ditch would be constructed that would be positioned between the secondary and first walls. The purpose of this was to place the enemy in a position that would leave them exposed to the enemy, making the invaders susceptible to arrow fire.&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt; The position of this ditch Walls within the interior of fortresses would become demilitarized during times of unity; leading to them being demolished. The parts that were used to construct said walls could then be reused, making the overall design extremely beneficial.

Fortresses within Ancient Egypt held multiple functions. During the [[Middle Kingdom of Egypt|Middle Kingdom]] Period, the [[Twelfth Dynasty of Egypt]] would establish means of control throughout the Nubian Riverside by creating fortified stations.  The location of Egyptian fortresses were not exclusive to just the riverside. Sites within both Egypt and Nubia would be placed on terrain that was either rocky or sandy.&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt; The purpose behind this method was to spread its influence throughout the region as well as discourage rival groups from raiding the sites.&lt;ref name=":022" /&gt; Inspections of these forts in Nubia have led to the discovery of copper smelting materials which suggest a relationship between miners in the region &lt;ref name=":022" /&gt; The occupation of these Nubian forts suggests a trade relationship between the two parties. Miners would collect the materials and would transfer them to these forts in exchange for food and water. Up until the Thirteenth dynasty, Egypt would hold control of Nubia through the use of these fortresses.&lt;ref name=":022" /&gt;

=== Pelusium Fortress ===

The Pelusium fortress served as means of protection from invaders coming towards the Nile Delta.&lt;ref name=":42"&gt;Stanley, Jean-Daniel, et al. “Pelusium, an Ancient Port Fortress on Egypt's Nile Delta Coast: Its Evolving Environmental Setting from Foundation to Demise.” ''Journal of Coastal Research'', vol. 24, no. 2, 2008, pp. 451–462. ''JSTOR'', JSTOR, www.jstor.org/stable/30137849.&lt;/ref&gt; While the site served this role for more than a millennium, Pelusium was also known for being a center of trade (both land and Maritime). Trade was primarily conducted between Egypt and the Levant.&lt;ref name=":42" /&gt; While information is not concrete in terms of the fortresses establishment, it is suggested that Pelusium was erected during either the [[Middle Kingdom of Egypt|Middle Kingdom]] period or during the Saite and Persian periods from the 16th and 18th century.&lt;ref name=":42" /&gt; Pelusium is also seen as an integral part of the Nile as other ruins were found outside its borders, indicating that the area was large in occupation. Architecturally, structures of Pelusium (such as it's gates and towers) appear to be built from limestone. A metallurgy industry is also indicated to have taken place at this site due to the discovery of copper-ore.&lt;ref name=":42" /&gt; Excavations of the site have also discovered older materials that date back some of the early dynasties. The found materials include Basalt, Granite, Diorite, Marble, and Quartzite.&lt;ref name=":42" /&gt; How these materials were utilized during the operation of is unclear as they may have been placed at the location more recently.&lt;ref name=":42" /&gt; Seeing as the fortress was placed in close proximity to the [[Nile|Nile River]], the fort was largely surrounded by both dunes and coastal lines.&lt;ref name=":42" /&gt;

There are multiple reasons that caused the decline of the Pelusium fortress. During its existence, events such as the Bubonic Plague appeared in the Mediterranean for the first time and multiple fires within the fortress occurred&lt;ref name=":42" /&gt;  Conquest from the Persians as well as a decrease in trade could also be attributed to the increase also may have lead to an increase in abandonment. Officially, natural reasons are what led to Pelusium falling apart such as tectonic motions.&lt;ref name=":42" /&gt;  The official desertion of the site is attributed to the time of the crusades.&lt;ref name=":42" /&gt;

=== Fortress of Jaffa ===
Jaffa Fortress was prominent during the [[New Kingdom of Egypt|New Kingdom]] period of Egypt. It served as both a fortress and a port on the Mediterranean coast. To this day, Jaffa serves as a primary Egyptian port.&lt;ref name=":22"&gt;Aaron A. Burke, et al. “Excavations of the New Kingdom Fortress in Jaffa, 2011–2014: Traces of Resistance to Egyptian Rule in Canaan.” ''American Journal of Archaeology'', vol. 121, no. 1, 2017, pp. 85–133. ''JSTOR'', JSTOR, www.jstor.org/stable/10.3764/aja.121.1.0085.&lt;/ref&gt; Originally under the control of the Canaanites, the site fell under the control of the Egyptian Empire. Because of a lack of evidence, it is unclear as to what exactly caused the succession from Canaanite to Egyptian occupation.&lt;ref name=":22" /&gt; During the [[Bronze Age|Late Bronze Age]], the site was successfully in holding campaigns from Pharaohs of the 18th dynasty.&lt;ref name=":22" /&gt; In terms of its functions, the site held multiple roles. It is suggested that Jaffa's primary function was to serve as a granary for the Egyptian Army.

Rameses gate, which is dated to the [[Bronze Age|Late Bronze Age]], serves as a connection to the fortress. Ramparts were also discovered with the fortress Upon excavation, the site hosted multiple items such as bowls, imported jars, pot stands, and beer and bread which further emphasizes the importance of these items to the area.&lt;ref name=":22" /&gt; The discovery of these objects show a close connection between the storing of food and the creation of ceramic items.&lt;ref name=":22" /&gt;

== Mastaba ==
Mastabas are burial tombs that hold royal significance. As chosen by Egyptian rulers, many of the tombs found throughout time were located along the Nile river.&lt;ref name=":32"&gt;L. E. R. “Two Mastaba Chambers.” ''Museum of Fine Arts Bulletin'', vol. 8, no. 45, 1910, pp. 19–20. ''JSTOR'', JSTOR, www.jstor.org/stable/4423469.&lt;/ref&gt; The structural exterior regarding Mastabas varies throughout history but there is a noticeable evolution of the course of Egyptian dynasties. The Mastabas of the First Egyptian Dynasty would be created through the use of stepped bricks.&lt;ref name=":03"&gt;Badawy, Alexander. “The Ideology of the Superstructure of the Mastaba-Tomb in Egypt.” ''Journal of Near Eastern Studies'', vol. 15, no. 3, 1956, pp. 180–183. ''JSTOR'', JSTOR, www.jstor.org/stable/542310.&lt;/ref&gt; The design would then evolve by the time of the Fourth Dynasty as the structural exterior change from brick to stone.&lt;ref name=":03" /&gt; The reasoning behind the stepped designs of Mastabas is connected to the idea of "accession".&lt;ref name=":03" /&gt;  Lateral penetration was a concern in when constructing tombs. In order to prevent damage to the structure, brickwork layers were placed around the base of structure.&lt;ref name=":03" /&gt; Mastabas from the old empire, took upon a pyramid design structure.&lt;ref name=":32" /&gt; This design was largely reserved for rulers, such as the king, and his family as a means for burial.&lt;ref name=":32" /&gt; Other design characteristics regarding Mastabas from the old empire include having rectangular outlines, walls that were slanted which were made of stone and brick materials, and having the axis of a building run both North and South.&lt;ref name=":32" /&gt; Multiple elements make up the interior of Mastabas such as an offering chamber, statues for the dead, and a vault beneath which held sarcophagi.&lt;ref name=":32" /&gt; By the end of the old Empire, the usage of these tombs were abandoned.[[File:Pyramid_of_Ahmose,_Abydos,_1998.png|link=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Pyramid_of_Ahmose,_Abydos,_1998.png|thumb|The Pyramid of Ahmose illustrates the decrease in structural design quality of New Kingdom Egypt.]]

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2887">The '''Archie Bray Foundation for the Ceramic Arts''' (also known as "The Bray") is a public, [[nonprofit]], educational institution located 3 miles from downtown [[Helena, Montana]], United States.

It was founded on the site of the former Western Clay Manufacturing Company in 1951 by brickmaker Archie Bray, a philanthropist and avid patron of the arts. Bray intended it to be "a place to make available for all who are seriously and sincerely interested in any of the branches of the ceramic arts, a fine place to work."

Although Bray died in 1953, his foundation survived the 1960 closure of Western Clay and in 1984 purchased the abandoned brickyard building and kilns. Today the '''Archie Bray Foundation for the Ceramic Arts''' is internationally acclaimed&lt;ref&gt;Aarstad, Rich, Ellie Arguimbau, Ellen Baumler, Charlene Porsild, and Brian Shovers.

'''Armin Hansen''' (1886–1957), a native of San Francisco, was a prominent American painter of the [[en plein air]] school, best known for his marine canvases.  His father [[Herman Wendelborg Hansen]] was also a famous artist of the American West.  The younger Hansen studied at the California School of Design in the Mark Hopkins Institute of Art (now the [[San Francisco Art Institute]]) and in Europe.  He achieved international recognition for his scenes depicting men and the sea off the northern coast of California.  He was elected an Associate to the [[National Academy of Design]] in 1926 and an Academician in 1948.&lt;ref name="shields"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Shields|first1=Scott A.| title=Armin Hansen: The Artful Voyage| date=2015| publisher=Pomegranate Communications, Inc.| location=Portland, OR|isbn=9780764969591|pages=7–279}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early years==
[[File:Art in California - a survey of American art with special reference to Californian painting, sculpture and architecture past and present, particularly as those arts were represented at the (14804616303).jpg|thumb|''Off for the Night Catch'' by Armin Hansen]]

He was born Armin Carl Hansen in [[San Francisco, California]] on October 23, 1886 and relocated 1891 with his family to the nearby island town of [[Alameda, California|Alameda]].  Here his father gave young Armin his first training in drawing and watercolors.  At the Mark Hopkins Institute he studied under several teachers, including the highly respected arts &amp; crafts designer [[Frederick Meyer]] and the Tonalist painter [[Arthur Frank Mathews]], from 1901 until his abrupt departure in the spring of 1905, when he was arrested for hazing fellow students.  Two unsuccessful attempts by the San Francisco District Attorney to prosecute Hansen for causing permanent and severe bodily injury to the young artist Albert DeRome created much negative publicity.&lt;ref&gt;San Francisco Call: 19 December 1903, p.7; 26 November 1904, p.3; 27 November 1904, p.28; 28 November 1904, p.3; 19 Septembers 1905, p. 16.&lt;/ref&gt;  These events combined with the April 1906 San Francisco earthquake and fire persuaded Hansen to leave his Alameda home and study in Europe.  Moving to Germany, he became the student of Carlos Grethe at the [[State Academy of Fine Arts in Stuttgart]] and briefly studied at the [[Academy of Fine Arts in Munich]].  Wishing to see the world through marine eyes, he periodically served as a deck hand between 1908 and 1912 on a number of commercial vessels, one being a Norwegian steam trawler.&lt;ref&gt;Carmel Pine Cone: 18 September 1931, p.11; 4 June 1937, p.7; 24 June 1938, p.8; 25 August 1939, p.5.&lt;/ref&gt;  His prolonged visits to the art centers in Berlin, London, Paris, Amsterdam, and Bruges during his six years abroad led him to adopt many of the tenets of [[Modernist art]].

==Life in Northern California==
Hansen arrived in San Francisco in the late fall of 1912 and during the following spring and summer he held very successful exhibitions of his European canvases at three of the most prestigious galleries: Helgesen's, Rabjohn &amp; Morcom's, and Schussler Brothers.&lt;ref&gt;San Francisco Call: 2 March 1913, p.29; 18 May 1913, p.31; 15 June 1913, p.32; 29 June 1913, p.32.&lt;/ref&gt;  During his lifetime his paintings and prints appeared in over a hundred exhibitions in California and nationally.&lt;ref name=shields /&gt;

In 1913 he first visited Monterey, where he eventually settled to teach and to find inspiration in the small fishing community and in the art colonies on the Peninsula.  He painted in oils and watercolors and perfected his skills in graphic arts, especially etchings.  Hansen became enamored of creating marine scenes, particularly involving man's relationship with the sea.  In 1914 he produced a ''Self Portrait''.  Hansen became extremely active in large [[Carmel-by-the-Sea]] art colony.  He was not a founder of the Carmel Art Association in 1927, but eventually joined that organization and served as president and on the board of directors.  He was the co-founder of the Carmel Art Institute in 1938.&lt;ref name=edwards /&gt;

In the early 1920s Hansen lived near the [[Stevenson House (Monterey, California)|Stevenson House]], and he often entertained other artists, including members of the [[Society of Six]].  By this time Hansen was not only one of the most well known California artists, but arguably the best teacher of the era.  A typical Painting of his early period in Monterey, ''Men of the Sea'', illustrates his bond with his subjects.  In 1920 he began outdoor lessons for both [[Clayton Sumner Price]] and [[August Francois Gay]]. [[E. Charlton Fortune]] also studied with Hansen. Hansen was also unique in that he had friends in among the avant-garde and conservative artists in Monterey and Carmel.  An important work of this period is his ''The Salmon Trawlers'' (1923), which is in the permanent collection of the [[Monterey Museum of Art]].

In the 1930s Hansen's paintings become more intense and use of light more pronounced.  One of his masterpieces of this era was ''Sardine Barge'' circa 1933, which appropriately is in the permanent collection of the [[Monterey Museum of Art]].

Later in Monterey Hansen led a group of artists in opposing a plan to remove [[Fisherman's Wharf, Monterey, California|Fisherman's Wharf]] as part of a grandiose [[Urban renewal|redevelopment]] scheme.  The wharf was an important subject of their art, besides the fact that Hansen identified with the simple life of a fisherman.  These artists were considered a [[Bohemianism|bohemian]] group, living in the [[Peters Gate]] area of Monterey, but amazingly they prevailed against bigger business interests.

==Posthumous honors==
In 1997, a film ''Time Captured in Paintings: The Monterey Legacy'' was produced honoring Hansen, along with [[E. Charlton Fortune]], [[William Frederic Ritschel]], [[Xavier Martinez]] and others.  The film, narrated by actor [[Jack Lemmon]] won the Golden Eagle Award from the prestigious [[CINE]] for documentary films in 1997.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3596">'''ArtWatch International''' was founded by [[James Beck (art historian)|James Beck]], [[professor]] of [[art history]] at [[Columbia University]], to monitor, and campaign for better practices in, the conservation of art works. The United Kingdom branch, '''ArtWatch UK''', is run by Michael Daley.

==Activities==

In 1991, Beck criticised the cleaning of [[Jacopo della Quercia]]'s sculpture, the tomb of Ilaria del Carretto in [[Lucca]] cathedral in [[Italy]].  As a result, the conservator sued him for "aggravated slander", which carries a possible three-year prison sentence. Beck won the case and subsequently co-founded ArtWatch.&lt;ref name=memoriam&gt;"In Memoriam", ''The Art Newspaper'', July/August 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

ArtWatch has been critical of many conservation practices and projects, including the restoration of [[Leonardo da Vinci]]'s [[The Last Supper (Leonardo da Vinci)|''The Last Supper'']] and the [[restoration of the Sistine Chapel frescoes]]. In 2004, it raised an unsuccessful petition to halt the restoration of [[Michelangelo]]'s ''[[David (Michelangelo)|David]]'', which has since been found to be developing cracks.

ArtWatch UK have included a commemorative issue on the late James Beck; a report on the damage to artworks in transit for blockbuster exhibitions; and articles critical of the results of restorations on modern painters like [[Gustav Klimt]]. The November 2008 ArtWatch UK journal contained 20 articles campaigning about developments in the UNESCO-protected city of [[Saint Petersburg]].

Beck was, and Daley is, frequently outspoken and their opinions on recent restorations have been covered regularly by the press.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ukic.org.uk/members/news.html ukic.org]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.artwatchinternational.org/db_images/pdfs/RaphaelPinksTimes19Oct2004.mht artwatchinternational.org] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20051231025337/http://www.artwatchinternational.org/db_images/pdfs/RaphaelPinksTimes19Oct2004.mht |date=December 31, 2005 }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, they have been equally strongly opposed by those they criticise. The Surveyor of the Fabric of [[St. Paul's Cathedral]], who oversaw a 2004 cleaning of the cathedral that came under fire by Daley, retorted that "ArtWatch UK sounds very grand, but seems to be the view of one person."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.timesonline.co.uk/printFriendly/0,,1-7-1139770,00.html ''The Times'']&lt;/ref&gt; The investigation of the  restoration campaign had been conducted and written by art historian, Florence Hallett.{{citation needed|date=November 2008}}

==Ludwig Burchard==
In April 2006 the ArtWatch UK Journal published research into Ludwig Burchard, a scholar who had made many attributions to [[Peter Paul Rubens|Rubens]]. This showed that Burchard had been prepared to make false attributions for commercial gain. It again called into question the authenticity of the [[National Gallery (London)|National Gallery]]'s ''[[Samson and Delilah (Rubens)|Samson and Delilah]]''—and the integrity of the then director [[Neil MacGregor]]. The research was conducted by Dr. [[Kasia Pisarek]].

The '''art world''' comprises everyone involved in producing, commissioning, presenting, [[Historic preservation|preserving]], promoting, chronicling, [[Art criticism|criticizing]], and selling [[fine art]].  

==Descriptions==
''Art world'' is indeed a wider term than [[art market]], though that is a large part of it.  [[Howard S. Becker]] describes it as "the network of people whose cooperative activity, organized via their joint knowledge of conventional means of doing things, produce(s) the kind of art works that art world is noted for" (Becker, 1982). In her book, ''Seven Days in the Art World'', Sarah Thornton describes it as "a loose network of overlapping subcultures held together by a belief in art. They span the globe but [[Art cluster|cluster]] in art capitals like New York, London, Los Angeles, and Berlin."&lt;ref name="Thornton"&gt;Thornton 2008&lt;/ref&gt; Other cities sometimes called "art capitals" include Beijing, Brussels, Hong Kong, Miami, Paris, Rome and Tokyo; due to their large art festivals, followings, and being the centers of art production.{{citation needed (lead)|date=August 2016}}

The notion of the singular ''art world'' is problematic, since Becker &lt;ref name="Becker"&gt;[[Howard S. Becker|Becker, Howard S.]] ''Art Worlds''. [[Berkeley, California|Berkeley]]: [[University of California]] Press, 1982. {{ISBN|0-520-05218-8}}. Cited in Sanjeck (1999).&lt;/ref&gt; and others show art worlds are, instead, independent multiplicities scattered worldwide that are always in flux: there is no "center" to the art world any more. In her analysis of the "net art world" (referring to network-aided art or [[net art]]), Amy Alexander states "net.art had a movement, at the very least it had coherence, and although it aimed to subvert the art world, eventually its own sort of art world formed around it. It developed a culture, hype and mystique through lists and texts; it had a centre, insiders, outsiders, even nodes.  This is of course not a failure; this is unavoidable: groups form; even anarchism is an institution." &lt;ref name="Alexander"&gt;Alexander, Amy. ''net art history'' (2001) [http://www.nettime.org/Lists-Archives/nettime-l-0102/msg00223.html Nettime.org]&lt;/ref&gt;
Art worlds exist at local and regional levels, as hidden or obscured subcultures, via primary and secondary art markets, through gallery circuits, around design movements, and, esoterically, as shared or perceived experiences. 

The one globalized, all-encompassing art world exists only as myth; rather, there are multiplicities of intersecting, overlapping, self-similar art worlds, each expressing different views of the world as they see it.

''[[Whitehot Magazine]]'' artist/publisher [[Noah Becker]] has published over 3500 articles about the Art World."&lt;ref&gt; Becker, Noah. [http://Whitehotmagazine.com His art magazine called Whitehot Magazine has taken the top spot as one of the only art magazines left in the world. &lt;/ref&gt;

''[[New York Magazine]]'' art critic [[Jerry Saltz]] has referred to [[William Powhida]]'s and Jade Townsend's drawing ''Art Basel Miami Beach Hooverville'' as "a great big art-world stinkbomb."&lt;ref&gt;Saltz, Jerry. [http://nymag.com/daily/entertainment/2010/03/saltz_william_powhida_is_makin.html "William Powhida Is Making Fun of Me, And I Love It"]. ''New York Magazine''. 9 March 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;!--  This is misleading nonsense as written
==Theory==
The term "art world" is  a product of the Institutional [[theory of art]]. It originates with the [[theorн of American art|theories of American art]] critic and [[philosopher]] [[Arthur Danto]]. In 1964 Danto published an essay "The Artworld," in which the term "artworld" was coined, meaning cultural context or "an atmosphere of art theory".&lt;ref&gt;http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/art-definition/&lt;/ref&gt; It has had considerable influence on aesthetic philosophy and, according to professor of philosophy Stephen David Ross, "especially upon [[George Dickie (philosopher)|George Dickie]]'s institutional theory of art." Dickie defines an art work as an artefact "which has had conferred upon it the status of candidate for appreciation by some person or persons acting in behalf of a certain social institution (the artworld)" (p. 43.)&lt;ref&gt;https://books.google.com/books?id=vDdZNwTmEqUC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=danto&amp;f=false&lt;/ref&gt;

The central core of Danto’s "The Artworld" is "artistic theory", which elevates things to the world of art (or art world). 

Danto writes: "these days one might not be aware he was on artistic terrain without an artistic theory to tell him so. And part of the reason for this lies in the fact that terrain is constituted artistic in virtue of artistic theories, so that one use of theories, in addition to helping us discriminate art from the rest, consists in making art possible" (Danto, The Artworld, p. 3).--&gt;

'''Augustine Phillips''' (died May 1605) was an [[English Renaissance theatre|Elizabethan]] [[actor]] who performed in troupes with [[Edward Alleyn]] and [[William Shakespeare]]. He was one of the first generation of English actors to achieve wealth and a degree of social status by means of his trade.

Phillips first enters the historical record as a member of the amalgamation of [[Lord Strange's Men]] and the [[Admiral's Men]] that performed ''[[The Seven Deadly Sins (play)|The Seven Deadly Sins]]'' (perhaps by [[Richard Tarlton]]) between 1590 and 1592. In the surviving "plot" of this performance, Phillips is assigned the role of [[Sardanapalus]]; he is one of the few actors not required to play a double role. He is named in the touring warrant issued to Strange's Men in 1592; after the death of their patron [[Ferdinando Stanley, 5th Earl of Derby|Ferdinando Stanley]] he joined the new [[Lord Chamberlain's Men]], presumably as a sharer.

Phillips remained with the company through its change to the [[King's Men (playing company)|King's Men]] and to his death in 1605. Little is known with certainty of his roles with the company, except that he was probably already mature when the company assembled. He appears in the cast lists for [[Ben Jonson]]'s ''[[Every Man in His Humour]]'' (1598), ''[[Every Man Out of His Humour]]'' (1599), and ''[[Sejanus]]'' (1603). He may be the author of a jig, ''Phillips His Slipper'', entered for publishing in the [[Stationers' Register]] in 1595.

He was one of the six sharers in the [[Globe Theatre]] when it was built in 1598&amp;ndash;9, with a one-eighth share. Over time this made him a comparatively wealthy man, at least as far as Elizabethan actors were concerned. Like Shakespeare, Phillips lived for many years near his occupation in [[Southwark]], in Paris Garden near the [[The Swan (theatre)|Swan Theatre]], and in [[Aldgate]]; but by the time of his death he owned a house in [[Mortlake]], in [[Surrey]].

In 1601, he was the representative of the company called to testify before the [[Privy Council of the United Kingdom|Privy Council]] about their involvement with the rebellion of the [[Robert Devereux, 2nd Earl of Essex|Earl of Essex]]; the Chamberlain's Men had been paid by supporters of the Earl to perform Shakespeare's ''[[Richard II (play)|Richard II]]'' before the abortive coup. Phillips' testimony seems to have assuaged whatever anger the court may have felt towards the players; they were not punished, and indeed played for [[Elizabeth I of England|Elizabeth]] at [[Whitehall Palace|Whitehall]] on 24 February 1601, the night before Essex was executed. (The choice of Phillips as representative is interesting; why him, and not Shakespeare or Burbage? He testified that the Lord Chamberlain's Men had played at the request of Essex's supporters, specifically because they were offered 40 shillings more than their normal fee. This might indicate that Phillips had a role in keeping the financial accounts of the company.)

The evidence suggests a life deeply intertwined with the theater. He was a stepbrother of his fellow King's Man [[Thomas Pope (16th-century actor)|Thomas Pope]], and his sister married another actor, [[Robert Gough (actor)|Robert Gough]].

Phillips's daughters Magdalen and Rebecca were baptized in the parish of St. Saviour's in [[Southwark]] in 1594 and 1596 respectively. A son, Augustine or Austen, was baptized there in 1601 but buried three years later. Phillips's will, which was signed on 4 May 1605 and probated on 13 May 1605, mentions two other daughters, Anne and Elizabeth, and his wife Anne, plus brothers, sisters, and other relations of a large family. The will includes a number of interesting and revealing bequests:

* a silver bowl worth £5 to each of the executors, [[John Heminges]], [[Richard Burbage]], and [[William Sly]];
* a 30-shilling gold piece each to [[Shakespeare]], [[Henry Condell]], and [[Christopher Beeston]] (Beeston is described as Phillips's "servant;" he was almost certainly a former apprentice);
* 20 shillings in gold each to [[Lawrence Fletcher]], [[Robert Armin]], [[Alexander Cooke]], [[Richard Cowley]], and [[Nicholas Tooley]];
* 40s. to his apprentice James Sands, along with a [[cittern]], a [[bandora (instrument)|bandora]], and a [[lute]], all pending the "expiration of his term of years in his indenture of apprenticehood;"
* 40s. to his "late apprentice" Samuel Gilburne, plus Phillips's "mouse-colored" velvet hose, his black taffeta suit and white taffeta doublet, his purple cloak, his sword and dagger, and his bass [[viol]];
* and £5 to be split among the hired men "of the company which I am of."

The musical instruments obviously imply that Phillips was a musician, and as such he was probably involved in the dramatic music used in productions throughout his career.

'''''Barge Haulers on the Volga''''' or '''''[[Burlak]]i''''' (Russian: '''''Burlaki na Volge''''', '''''Бурлаки на Волге''''') is an 1870–73 oil-on-canvas painting by the [[Social realism|realist]] artist [[Ilya Repin]]. It depicts 11 men physically dragging a [[barge]] on the banks of the [[Volga River]]. They are at the point of collapse from exhaustion, oppressed by heavy, hot weather.&lt;ref name="Frank111"&gt;Frank, Joseph. "Dostoevsky: The Mantle of the Prophet, 1871–1881". Princeton University Press, 2003. 111. {{ISBN|0-691-11569-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Not long after Repin's painting, burlakis were replaced by steam powered tug-boats&lt;/ref&gt;

The work is a condemnation of profit from inhumane labor.&lt;ref&gt;[[Rosalind Polly Gray|Gray, Rosalind Polly]]. ''Russian genre painting in the nineteenth century''. Alderley: Clarendon Press, 2000. ix. {{ISBN|0-19-820875-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although they are presented as stoical and accepting, the men are defeated; only one stands out: in the center of both the row and canvas, a brightly colored youth fights against his leather binds and takes on a heroic pose.

Repin conceived the painting during his travels through Russia as a young man and depicts actual characters he encountered. It drew international praise for its realistic portrayal of the hardships of working men, and launched his career.&lt;ref name="AH"&gt;Hilton, Alison. "The Exhibition of Experiments in St. Petersburg and the Independent Sketch". ''The Art Bulletin'', Volume 70, No. 4, December, 1988. 677–698&lt;/ref&gt; Soon after its completion, the painting was purchased by  [[Grand Duke Vladimir Alexandrovich of Russia|Grand Duke Vladimir Alexandrovich]] and exhibited widely throughout Europe as a landmark of Russian realist painting. ''Barge Haulers on the Volga'' has been described as "perhaps the most famous painting of the [[Peredvizhniki]] movement [for]....its unflinching portrayal of  backbreaking labor".&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.tmora.org/educationData/JaneFriedman.html Ilya Repin, Barge-Haulers on the Volga (1870–73)] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100201085918/http://www.tmora.org/educationData/JaneFriedman.html |date=1 February 2010 }}". [[The Museum of Russian Art]]. Retrieved 18 January 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
[[File:burlaks walking.jpg|thumb|1900s photograph of [[burlaks]] on the Volga River]]
Repin was accepted into the Imperial Academy of Art in St. Petersburg in 1863. The academy at the time was known for its deep conservatism and leaning towards academic art, a fact that bred a sense of revolt and desire for change in many of its students.&lt;ref name="AK" /&gt;

''Barge Haulers'' was inspired by scenes witnessed by Repin while holidaying on the Volga in 1870. He made a number of preparatory studies, mostly in oil, while staying in Shiriaev Buerak, near [[Tolyatti|Stavropol]] (Stavropol-na-Volge).&lt;ref name="AK"&gt;King, Averil.

The characters are based on actual people Repin came to know while preparing for the work. He had had difficulty finding subjects to pose for him, even for a fee, because of a folklorish belief that a subject's [[soul]] would leave his possession once his image was put down on paper.&lt;ref&gt;Emerson, Caryl. ''The life of Musorgsky''. In: "Musical lives". ''Cambridge University Press'', 1999. 127. {{ISBN|0-521-48507-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; The subjects include a former soldier, a former priest, and a painter.&lt;ref name="AM134"&gt;Amery, Colin. "St Petersburg". Frances Lincoln, 2006. 134. {{ISBN|0-7112-2492-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although he depicted eleven men, women also performed the work and there were normally many more people in a barge-hauling gang; Repin selected these figures as representative of a broad swathe of the working classes of Russian society. That some had once held relatively high social positions dismayed the young artist, who had initially planned to produce a far more superficial work contrasting exuberant day-trippers (which he himself had been) with the careworn burlaks. Repin found a particular empathy with Kanin, the defrocked priest, who is portrayed as the lead hauler and looks outwards towards the viewer.&lt;ref name="P&amp;P"&gt;Parker &amp; Parker, 23&lt;/ref&gt; The artist wrote,
:"There was something eastern about it, the face of a [[Scythia|Scyth]]...and what eyes! What depth of vision!...And his brow, so large and wise...He seemed to me a colossal mystery, and for that reason I loved him. Kanin, with a rag around his head, his head in patches made by himself and then worn out, appeared none the less as a man of dignity; he was like a saint."&lt;ref name="AM"&gt;Amery, Colin &amp; Curran, Brian.

==Description==
[[File:Ilja Jefimowitsch Repin 010.jpg|thumb|''Barge Haulers Crossing a Ford'', Ilya Repin, oil on canvas, 1872. 62 × 97 cm. The State Tretyakov Gallery, Moscow.]]
''Barge Haulers on the Volga'' shows a row of eleven male [[burlak]]s dragging a barge on the [[Volga River]] that must be pulled upstream against the current.&lt;ref name="B138"&gt;Bolton (1999), 138&lt;/ref&gt; The men are dressed in rags and bound with leather harnesses. They are rendered as mostly stoical, although in obvious physical discomfort, with their bodies bowed in toil.&lt;ref name="AM134"&gt;Amery, Colin. "St Petersburg". Frances Lincoln, 2006. 134. {{ISBN|0-7112-2492-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; The scene is rendered in a white, silvery light which has been described as "almost Venetian".&lt;ref name="P&amp;P"&gt;Parker &amp; Parker, 23&lt;/ref&gt; In earlier studies, it was dominated by blue tones.

The men appear to be unsupervised and form the focus of the picture, with the barge relegated to a minor role at the rear of the frame. Further in the distance is a tiny steam-powered boat,&lt;ref name="VV"&gt;Stasov , Vladimir Vasilyevich. "Letter to the Editor of 'St. Petersburg Gazette' (1873)". ''Saint Petersburg Gazette'', no. 176, 18 March 1873&lt;/ref&gt; perhaps a suggestion that the back-breaking labor of the barge haulers is no longer necessary in the industrial age.&lt;ref&gt;Cohen, Aaron J. "Imagining the unimaginable: World War, modern art, &amp; the politics of public culture in Russia, 1914–1917". ''Studies in war, society, and the military''. University of Nebraska Press, 2008. 25. {{ISBN|0-8032-1547-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also worthy of note is the inverted Russian flag flying from the main mast of the barge, adding to the sense of hostile unease. Repin echoes the stop-go rhythm of the labor in the undulating line of the workers' heads.  In the preparatory studies, many of the figures were positioned differently; for example the second man was shown wearing a cap with his head bowed into his chest.&lt;ref name="P&amp;P" /&gt;

[[File:Gustave Courbet 018.jpg|left|thumb|''[[The Stone Breakers]]'', [[Gustave Courbet]], 1850. Destroyed]]
There is a general sense of mounting exhaustion and despair moving from left to right among the group; the last hauler seems oblivious to his surroundings and drifts from the line out towards the viewer. The exception is a fair-haired boy in the center of the group. Set brightly against the uniform muted tones of his companions, he stands straighter; his head is raised looking into the distance, while he pulls against his straps as if determined to free himself from his task.

&lt;!-- [[File:Burial at Ornans.jpg|260px|thumb|''[[A Burial at Ornans]]'', Gustave Courbet, 1850. [[Musée d'Orsay]], Paris]] --&gt;
Repin grew up in [[Chuhuiv|Chuguev]], in the [[Kharkov Governorate]] (now [[Ukraine]]) and was aware of the poverty and hardship of most rural life at that time. He spent two years traveling, during which time he observed both the [[dacha]]s of the rich and the toil of the common peasant. As such the painting can be considered a [[Genre works|genre work]],&lt;ref name="Frank111" /&gt; but treated on the heroic scale of [[history painting]], as was often the case in 19th-century works, especially after ''[[A Burial At Ornans]]'' by [[Gustave Courbet]] (1850).  ''Barge Haulers'' drew direct comparisons from critics with [[Jean-François Millet|Millet]]'s works and Courbet's ''[[The Stone Breakers]]'' (also 1850), which showed laborers at the side of a road.&lt;ref name="V208"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Alpatov, 251&lt;/ref&gt;

The painting is a relentlessly physical description of the men; Repin was attracted by their strength and superhuman effort. According to critic [[Vladimir Stassov]], "They are like a group of forest Hercules with their disheveled heads, their sun-tanned chests, and their motionlessly hanging, strong-veined hands. What glances from untamed eyes, what distended nostrils, what iron muscles!"&lt;ref name="A252"&gt;Alpatov, 252&lt;/ref&gt; In his description of their heavy brows and the lined foreheads, Repin does not neglect their spiritual torment; although he does not concentrate too much on any single man's personal intimate emotions. Any sense of personal hardship is of secondary importance to the portrayal of effort and human dignity.&lt;ref name="A252" /&gt;

==Critical opinion, propaganda, and legacy==
Repin considered ''Barge Haulers'' to be his first professional painting and it is the work that defined him as a master documentarian of [[social inequality]].&lt;ref name="B114"&gt;Bolton, 114&lt;/ref&gt; When first exhibited, it received enthusiastic reviews for its unsentimental depiction of lower-class laborers, which stood in stark contrast to the romanticised, classical or propagandist nature of most contemporary Russian art.&lt;ref name="AM134" /&gt; The painting paved the way for Repin to join the [[Peredvizhniki]] (the ''Wanderers'' or ''Itinerants''), an anti-[[Academic art|academic]] realist movement formed in 1870.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.dartmouth.edu/~russ15/russia_PI/Russian_art.html Nineteenth-Century Russian Art: [[Ideological realism]]]". dartmouth.edu. Retrieved on 18 January 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; The Peredvizhniki sought not only to break away from the academic school, but also to subvert the manner in which art was viewed. By depicting scenes from ordinary life and holding exhibitions in the provinces they aimed to enlighten and make art more accessible to the masses.&lt;ref name="B114" /&gt;

The painting was widely discussed for its break with the traditions of the Academy. It earned Repin the respect of [[Vladimir Stasov]]&lt;ref name="AK" /&gt; who believed that art shaped people's outlook and the way in which they viewed their own political situation. Stasov encouraged Repin to focus on Russian subject matter and after the release of ''Barge Haulers,'' he became a close friend of the artist and enthusiastically praised each of Repin's paintings thereafter. Stasov wrote of the painting, "with a daring that is unprecedented amongst us [Repin] has abandoned all former conceptions of the ideal in art, and has plunged head first into the very heart of the people's life, the people's interests, and the people's oppressive reality... no one in Russia has ever dared take on such a subject".&lt;ref&gt;Bolton, 156&lt;/ref&gt;  In return, Repin said that Stasov's "cry all over Russia was the first and the mightiest and it was heard in Russia by everyone capable of hearing. It was thanks to him that my glory spread."&lt;ref&gt;Chandler, Josh. "[http://germslav.byu.edu/perspectives/2006/Chandler_Josh.pdf Vladimir Vasilievich Stasov and Soviet Socialist Realism]". germslav.byu.edu. Retrieved on 27 February 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:1875 bridgman scene de halage sur le nil 01.jpg|thumb|right|[[Frederick Arthur Bridgman]], ''Towing on the Nile'', 1875.]]
[[Fyodor Dostoyevsky]] read about Repin's painting in the newspapers and assumed it was another Russian work whose artistry was secondary to its social message. He wrote, "Even the subject itself is terrible... I came expecting to see these barge-haulers all lined up in uniforms with the usual labels stuck to their foreheads... To my delight, all my fears turned out to be in vain... Not a single one of them shouts from the painting to the viewer, 'Look how unfortunate I am and how indebted you are to the people!'"&lt;ref&gt;Miller, Robin Feuer. ''Dostoevsky's unfinished journey.'' Yale University Press, 2007. 11. {{ISBN|0-300-12015-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; To Dostoyevsky, Repin had avoided a common fault of contemporary Russian art, and in doing so had heightened the work's impact. He concluded, "[I saw] barge haulers, real barge haulers, and nothing more... you can't help but think you are indebted, truly indebted, to the people."&lt;ref name="Frank111" /&gt; Such a feeling of an "unpaid debt" owed by the higher society to the peasantry was a common idea of the ''[[Narodniks]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Parker Fran. "Russia on canvas: Ilya Repin". Pennsylvania State University Press, 1980. 26. {{ISBN|0-271-00252-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Today the painting is regarded as seminal in the formation of Russian realism.&lt;ref name="V208"&gt;Valkenier (1993), 208&lt;/ref&gt;

The painting has been criticised both for still bearing hallmarks of academic drawing and for having an overall yellowish tone.&lt;ref name="A252" /&gt; Although it won a prize at the Society for the Advancement of the Arts in 1872, Repin continued to rework the canvas until 1873 when it was exhibited at the Academy of Arts in St. Petersburg.&lt;ref name="CA" /&gt;

The painting has been widely parodied, and it is often used as the basis for satirical political cartoons in Russia. A 1958 Finnish political cartoon based on the painting created an international hubbub in 1958 for showing [[Nikita Khrushchev]] on a barge pulled by [[Eastern bloc]] countries shouting "Imperialists!" to the US and UK on the shore.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.uusisuomi.fi/kulttuuri/36729-tasta-suomalaiskuvasta-nousi-jattikohu-1958&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the art critic Elia Kabanov, Repin's painting influenced American orientalist painter [[Frederick Arthur Bridgman]] to produce his ''Towing on the Nile'' in 1875.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://metkere.com/2011/03/bridgman.html | title=Бурлаки на Ниле | accessdate=9 March 2011 | author=Kabanov, Elia | year=2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Provenance==
Despite its social realism, ''Barge Haulers'' was bought by the [[Grand Duke Vladimir Alexandrovich of Russia|Tsar's second son]]. It was lent for exhibition at the [[Weltausstellung 1873 Wien|1873 International Exhibition]] in Vienna, where it won a bronze medal. It was exhibited outside Russia again in 1878, when it was again widely praised by critics for marking a watershed in Russian art.&lt;ref name="V208" /&gt; After the [[Russian Revolution (1917)|Russian Revolution]] the grand duke's art collection was [[nationalization|nationalize]]d and transferred from [[Vladimir Palace]] to the [[Russian Museum]].&lt;ref&gt;"[http://art.1september.ru/2003/22/no22_1.htm Государственный Русский музей]". art.1september.ru.

'''''Beach in Pourville''''' (title in French: ''La plage à Pourville, soleil couchant'')  is a painting by [[France|French]] artist [[Claude Monet]].&lt;ref name="BBC"&gt;{{citation | title = Stolen Monet painting recovered in Poland| url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/arts_and_culture/8461814.stm | publisher = BBC News | date = 15 January 2010}}.&lt;/ref&gt; It is one of an 1882 series of oil-on-canvas works by Monet in the small seaside resort of Pourville-sur-Mer (now part of the [[Communes of France|''commune'']] of [[Hautot-sur-Mer]]), near [[Dieppe, Seine-Maritime|Dieppe]] in northern France. Monet is considered one of the most important members of the group of painters identified as the [[Impressionist]]s. The painting was bought by the [[National Museum, Poznań]], [[Poland]] in 1906 and exhibited in the display of their collection.&lt;ref name="PolskieRadio"&gt;{{citation | title = Monet back in Poznan Museum | url = http://www.thenews.pl/national/artykul123816_monet-back-in-poznan-museum.html | publisher = Polskie Radio | date = 16 January 2010}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Theft and recovery==
The painting [[art theft|was stolen]] from the Poznań National Museum in September 2000.&lt;ref name="BBC"/&gt; It was cut out of its frame and replaced with a copy, which had been painted on cardboard. At the time, the painting was valued at more than [[United States dollar|$]]1&amp;nbsp;million,&lt;ref name="BBC"/&gt;&lt;ref name="PolskieRadio"/&gt; and was the only painting by Monet on public display in Poland.&lt;ref name="AFP"&gt;{{citation | title = Poland's stolen Monet found, suspect arrested | url = https://www.google.com/hostednews/afp/article/ALeqM5geFmRhYbBgXNCMaE_eu7ltw5mn7w | publisher = Agence France Presse}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The theft was discovered on 19&amp;nbsp;September 2000, and police searched for a man who had been seen making sketches of paintings in the museum two days earlier.&lt;ref name="BBC"/&gt;

The painting was recovered on 12 January 2010.&lt;ref name="BBC"/&gt;&lt;ref name="PolskieRadio"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Sofia"&gt;{{citation | title = Stolen Monet recovered in Poland| url = http://www.sofiaecho.com/2010/01/15/843015_stolen-monet-recovered-in-poland | publisher = Sofia Echo | date = 15 January 2010}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Police also arrested a 41-year-old man in the southern Polish city of [[Olkusz]],&lt;ref name="BBC"/&gt; whom they believe to be the painter of the copy used in the robbery.&lt;ref name="AFP"/&gt;  The suspect was traced through fingerprints and other evidence left at the site of the theft.&lt;ref name="PA"&gt;{{citation | title = Stolen Monet painting recovered| url = https://www.google.com/hostednews/ukpress/article/ALeqM5hYKIj54PEEnxudCUwH8hCo_0yIlw | publisher = Press Association | date = 13 January 2010}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Bon pour l'Orient''' (good enough for the [[Orient]]) is a [[French language|French]] condescending term that refers to the stamps affixed in the 19th century to the diplomas of students coming from [[Colony|colonial]] or [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] territories. These students were subjected to a less intensive level of education in [[Western world|Western]] educational institutions and obtained degrees which despite being useless in Europe, were deemed good enough to secure employment in the colonies.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Reporting the Middle East: The Practice of News in the Twenty-First Century|last=Harb|first=Zahera|publisher=I.B.Tauris|year=2017|isbn=1786721767|location=|page=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In modern use, the phrase pejoratively describes practices which although unacceptable in advanced Western countries, might be thought appropriate for less developed countries.

The lower parts of the statues' arms were constructed from the same mud-straw mix supported on wooden armatures. It is believed that the upper parts of their faces were made from great wooden masks or casts. The rows of holes that can be seen in photographs held wooden pegs that stabilized the outer stucco.

[[File:Bamiyan Buddhas Burnes.jpg|thumbnail|left|Drawing of the Buddhas of Bamiyan, visited by Alexander Burnes in 1832]]

Bamiyan lies on the [[Silk Road]], which runs through the [[Hindu Kush]] mountain region, in the Bamiyan Valley. The Silk Road has been historically a caravan route linking the markets of China with those of the Western world. It was the site of several [[Buddhist monasteries]], and a thriving center for religion, philosophy, and art. Monks at the monasteries lived as [[hermit]]s in small caves carved into the side of the Bamiyan cliffs. Most of these monks embellished their caves with religious statuary and elaborate, brightly colored [[fresco]]es. It was a Buddhist religious site from the 2nd century up to the time of the [[Islam]]ic invasion in the later half of the 7th century. Until it was completely conquered by the [[Muslim]] [[Saffarids]] in the 9th century, Bamiyan shared the culture of [[Gandhara]].

The two most prominent statues were the giant standing sculptures of Buddhas [[Vairocana]] and [[Sakyamuni]], identified by the different [[mudras]] performed. The Buddha popularly called "Solsol" measured 53 meters tall, and "Shahmama" 35 meters—the niches in which the figures stood are 58 and 38 meters respectively from bottom to top.&lt;ref name="state"&gt;Research of state and stability of the rock niches of the Buddhas of Bamiyan in [http://www.unibw.de/bauv5/forschung/abgeschlossene_forschungsvorhaben/buddha "Completed Research Results of Military University of Munich"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304032715/http://www.unibw.de/bauv5/forschung/abgeschlossene_forschungsvorhaben/buddha |date=4 March 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://cipa.icomos.org/fileadmin/template/doc/antalya/120.pdf |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131216070456/http://cipa.icomos.org/fileadmin/template/doc/antalya/120.pdf |dead-url=yes |archive-date=16 December 2013 |title=Computer Reconstruction and Modeling of the Great Buddha Statue in Bamiyan, Afghanistan |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=9 October 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Before being blown up in 2001 they were the largest examples of standing Buddha carvings in the world (the 8th century [[Leshan Giant Buddha]] is taller,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=UNESCO World Heritage Centre |url=http://whc.unesco.org/en/list/779 |title=Mount Emei Scenic Area, including Leshan Giant Buddha Scenic Area |publisher=Whc.unesco.org |date= |accessdate=9 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; but that statue is sitting).

Plans for the construction of the Spring Temple Buddha were announced soon after the blowing up of the Bamiyan Buddhas and China condemned the systematic destruction of the Buddhist heritage of Afghanistan.

[[File:BamyanBuddha Smaller 1.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Smaller Buddha in 1977]]

It is believed that the monumental Buddha sculptures were carved into the cliffs of Bamiyan between the 3rd to 6th centuries AD, while the cave complex in the east, including the 38 meter Buddha, a stupa was built in the 3rd or 4th centuries AD. The 55 meter Buddha is believed to date from the 5th and 6th centuries AD. Historic documentation refers to celebrations held every year attracting numerous pilgrims and that offers were made to the monumental statues (http://whc.unesco.org/uploads/nominations/208rev.pdf). They were perhaps the most famous cultural landmarks of the region, and the site was listed by [[UNESCO]] as a [[World Heritage Site]] along with the surrounding cultural landscape and archaeological remains of the Bamiyan Valley. Their color faded through time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2011/02/110225122816.htm |title=Bamiyan Buddhas Once Glowed in Red, White and Blue |publisher=Sciencedaily.com |date=25 February 2011 |accessdate=9 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Chinese Buddhist pilgrim [[Xuanzang]] visited the site on 30 April 630 AD,&lt;ref&gt;Yamada, Meiji (2002).

He also noted that both Buddha figures were "decorated with gold and fine jewels" (Wriggins, 1995). Intriguingly, Xuanzang mentions a third, even larger, reclining statue of the Buddha.&lt;ref name="gall1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="laputanlogic"/&gt; A monumental seated Buddha, similar in style to those at Bamiyan, still exists in the [[Bingling Temple]] caves in China's [[Gansu]] province.

The destruction of the Bamyan Buddhas became a symbol of oppression and a rallying point for the freedom of religious expression. Despite the fact that most Afghans are now Muslim, they too had embraced their past and many were appalled by the destruction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://hazaristantimes.wordpress.com/2009/06/04/bamyan-series/ |title=Buddhas of Bamiyan |publisher=Hazaristantimes.wordpress.com |date= |accessdate=9 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=TIM MCGIRK/Bamiyan |url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,238674,00.html |title=What Lies Beneath |publisher=Time.com |date=20 May 2002 |accessdate=9 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Attacks on the Buddha's statue===

====11th to the 20th century====
In 1221, with the advent of [[Genghis Khan]], "a terrible disaster befell Bamiyan."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://depts.washington.edu/silkroad/cities/afghanistan/bamiyan.html |title=Bamiyan and Buddhism Afghanistan |publisher=Depts.washington.edu |date= |accessdate=9 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.kashgar.com.au/articles/Remembering-Bamiyan |title=Remembering Bamiyan |publisher=Kashgar.com.au |date= |accessdate=9 October 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131004201837/http://www.kashgar.com.au/articles/Remembering-Bamiyan |archivedate=4 October 2013 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, the statues were spared. Later, the Mughal emperor, [[Aurangzeb]], tried to use heavy artillery to destroy the statues. Another attempt to destroy the Bamiyan statues was made by the 18th century Persian king [[Nader Shah|Nader Afshar]], directing cannon fire at them.&lt;ref&gt;''Asian Art'', chap. "History of attacks on the Buddhas"&lt;/ref&gt;

The enormous statues, the male Salsal ("light shines through the universe") and the (smaller) female Shamama ("Queen Mother"),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.christian-frei.info/dvd/christian_frei-booklet_en.pdf |title=booklet web E.indd |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=9 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; as they were called by the locals, did not fail to fire the imagination of Islamic writers in centuries past. The larger statue reappears as the malevolent giant Salsal in medieval Turkish tales.&lt;ref&gt;Laban Kaptein, ''Eindtijd en Antichrist'', p. 127. Leiden 1997. {{ISBN|90-73782-89-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====1997 to 2001, under the Taliban====
Abdul Wahed, a Taliban commander operating around the area, announced his intention to blow up the Buddhas in 1997, even before he had taken control of the valley. In 1998 when he battled off the [[Hizb-i-Wahdat]] militia from the area and took control of Bamiyan, Wahed drilled holes in the Buddhas' heads for explosives. He was prevented from taking further action by the local governor and a direct order of [[Mohammed Omar]], although tires were later burned on the head of the great Buddha.&lt;ref&gt;Semple, Michael [http://aan-afghanistan.com/index.asp?id=1538 ''Why the Buddhas of Bamian were destroyed''], [[Afghanistan Analysts Network]] 2 March 2011&lt;/ref&gt; In July 1999, Mullah Mohammed Omar issued a decree in favor of the preservation of the Bamiyan Buddha statues. Because Afghanistan's Buddhist population no longer exists, and the statues were no longer worshipped, he added: "The government considers the Bamiyan statues as an example of a potential major source of income for Afghanistan from international visitors. The Taliban states that Bamiyan shall not be destroyed but protected."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| last = Harding| first = Luke| date = 3 March 2001| title = How the Buddha got his wounds| publisher = The Guardian| url = https://www.theguardian.com/books/2001/mar/03/books.guardianreview2| archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20060228113747/http://www.guardian.co.uk/Archive/Article/0%2C4273%2C4145138%2C00.html| archivedate = 28 February 2006| accessdate = 23 March 2008| location = London| deadurl = yes| df = dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; In early 2000, local Taliban authorities asked for UN assistance to rebuild drainage ditches around tops of the alcoves where the Buddhas were set.&lt;ref&gt;Semple, Michael [http://aan-afghanistan.com/index.asp?id=1538 Why the Buddhas of Bamian were destroyed], [[Afghanistan Analysts Network]] 2 March 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

However, Afghanistan's radical clerics began a campaign to crack down on "un-Islamic" segments of Afghan society. The Taliban soon banned all forms of imagery, music, and sports, including television, in accordance with what they considered a strict interpretation of [[Sharia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = The Destruction of Statues Displayed in an Islamic State| publisher = Ask-Imam.com| first = Moulana Imraan| last= Vawda |url = http://www.islam.tc/ask-imam/view.php?q=3436| accessdate = 6 January 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 2001, the statues were destroyed by the Taliban of Mullah Omar following a decree issued by him. The Taliban supreme leader Mullah Omar explained why he ordered the statues to be destroyed in an interview:
{{quote|I did not want to destroy the Bamiyan Buddha. In fact, some foreigners came to me and said they would like to conduct the repair work of the Bamiyan Buddha that had been slightly damaged due to rains. This shocked me. I thought, these callous people have no regard for thousands of living human beings - the Afghans who are dying of hunger, but they are so concerned about non-living objects like the Buddha. This was extremely deplorable. That is why I ordered its destruction. Had they come for humanitarian work, I would have never ordered the Buddha's destruction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Mohammad Shehzad |url=http://www.rediff.com/news/2004/apr/12inter.htm |title=The Rediff Interview/Mullah Omar|date=3 March 2001|work=The Rediff|accessdate=27 October 2010 | location=Kabul}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Information and Culture Minister Qadratullah Jamal told [[Associated Press]] of a decision by 400 religious clerics from across Afghanistan declaring the Buddhist statues against the tenets of Islam. "They came out with a consensus that the statues were against Islam," said Jamal.

According to UNESCO Director-General [[Koïchiro Matsuura]], a meeting of ambassadors from the 54 member states of the [[Organisation of Islamic Cooperation|Organisation of the Islamic Conference]] (OIC) was conducted. All OIC states—including [[Pakistan]], [[Saudi Arabia]], and the [[United Arab Emirates]], three countries that officially recognised the Taliban government—joined the protest to spare the monuments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |date=3 March 2001| title = World appeals to Taliban to stop destroying statues| publisher = CNN| url = http://archives.cnn.com/2001/WORLD/asiapcf/central/03/03/afghan.buddhas.03/index.html| accessdate = 6 January 2008 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20071224155700/http://archives.cnn.com/2001/WORLD/asiapcf/central/03/03/afghan.buddhas.03/index.html |archivedate = 24 December 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Saudi Arabia and the UAE later condemned the destruction as "savage".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|date=4 March 2001 |first=Barry |last=Bearak |title=Over World Protests, Taliban Are Destroying Ancient Buddhas |publisher=The New York Times |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2001/03/04/world/04AFGH.html?ex=1218686400&amp;en=f513bb4edae409e0&amp;ei=5070 |accessdate=13 July 2008 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140302192951/http://www.nytimes.com/2001/03/04/world/04AFGH.html?ex=1218686400&amp;en=f513bb4edae409e0&amp;ei=5070 |archivedate=2 March 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Although [[India]] never recognised the Taliban regime in Afghanistan, [[New Delhi]] offered to arrange for the transfer of all the artifacts in question to India, "where they would be kept safely and preserved for all mankind".

Initially, the statues were fired at for several days using anti-aircraft guns and artillery. This caused severe damage, but did not obliterate them. During the destruction, Taliban Information Minister Qudratullah Jamal lamented that, "This work of destruction is not as simple as people might think. You can't knock down the statues by shelling as both are carved into a cliff; they are firmly attached to the mountain".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://edition.cnn.com/2001/WORLD/asiapcf/central/03/12/afghan.buddha.02/ |title=Photos document destruction of Afghan Buddhas |accessdate=2007-03-13 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070313235406/http://edition.cnn.com/2001/WORLD/asiapcf/central/03/12/afghan.buddha.02/ |archivedate=13 March 2007 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; Later, the Taliban placed anti-tank mines at the bottom of the niches, so that when fragments of rock broke off from artillery fire, the statues would receive additional destruction from particles that set off the mines.

On 18 March 2001, ''[[The New York Times]]'' reported that a Taliban envoy said the Islamic government made its decision in a rage after a foreign delegation offered money to preserve the ancient works.

Then Taliban [[ambassador-at-large]] [[Sayed Rahmatullah Hashemi]] said that the destruction of the statues was carried out by the Head Council of Scholars after a Swedish monuments expert proposed to restore the statues' heads. Hashimi is reported as saying: "When the Afghan head council asked them to provide the money to feed the children instead of fixing the statues, they refused and said, 'No, the money is just for the statues, not for the children'. Herein, they made the decision to destroy the statues"; however, he did not comment on the claim that a foreign museum offered to "buy the Buddhist statues, the money from which could have been used to feed children".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Kassaimah |first=Sahar |date=12 January 2001 |title=Afghani Ambassador Speaks At USC |publisher=[[IslamOnline]] |url=http://www.islamonline.net/english/news/2001-03/13/article12.shtml |accessdate=6 January 2008 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071008012138/http://www.islamonline.net/english/news/2001-03/13/article12.shtml |archivedate=8 October 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The destruction of the Bamiyan Buddhas despite protests from the international community has been described by Michael Falser, a heritage expert at the Center for Transcultural Studies in Germany, as an attack by the Taliban against the globalising concept of "cultural heritage".&lt;ref&gt;Falser, Michael. "The Bamiyan Buddhas, performative iconoclasm and the 'image' of heritage". In: Giometti, Simone; Tomaszewski, Andrzej (eds.): ''The Image of Heritage. Changing Perception, Permanent Responsibilities.'' Proceedings of the International Conference of the ICOMOS International Scientific Committee for the Theory and the Philosophy of Conservation and Restoration. 6–8 March 2009 Florence, Italy. Firenze 2011: 157-169.&lt;/ref&gt; The director general of the UN Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) Koichiro Matsuura called the destruction a "...crime against culture. It is abominable to witness the cold and calculated destruction of cultural properties which were the heritage of the Afghan people, and, indeed, of the whole of humanity."&lt;ref&gt;[http://abcnews.go.com/International/story?id=81406&amp;page=1#.UA4FSrQe5TI U.N. Confirms Destruction of Afghan Buddhas], 12 March 2001, ABC News.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Commitment to rebuild==
{{BuddhasHolySites}}

Though the figures of the two large Buddhas have been destroyed, their outlines and some features are still recognizable within the recesses. It is also still possible for visitors to explore the monks' caves and passages that connect them. As part of the international effort to rebuild Afghanistan after the Taliban war, the [[Government of Japan|Japanese government]] and several other organizations—among them the Afghanistan Institute in [[Bubendorf]], Switzerland, along with the [[ETH]] in [[Zurich]]—have committed to rebuilding, perhaps by [[anastylosis]], the two larger Buddhas.

===Developments since 2002===
In April 2002, Afghanistan's post-Taliban leader [[Hamid Karzai]] called the destruction a "national tragedy" and pledged the Buddhas to be rebuilt.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://edition.cnn.com/2002/WORLD/asiapcf/central/04/09/gen.karzai.bamiyan/index.html|title=CNN.com - Karzai pledges to rebuild Afghan Buddhas - April  9, 2002|first=Staff and|last=wires|website=edition.cnn.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 2005, [[Mawlawi Mohammed Islam Mohammadi]], Taliban governor of Bamiyan province at the time of the destruction and widely seen as responsible for its occurrence, was elected to the Afghan Parliament. He blamed the decision to destroy the Buddhas on [[Al-Qaeda]]'s influence on the Taliban.&lt;ref&gt;''Focus on Terrorism, Volume 8'' by Edward V. Linden&lt;/ref&gt; In January 2007, he was assassinated in Kabul.

Swiss filmmaker [[Christian Frei]] made a 95-minute documentary titled ''[[The Giant Buddhas]]'' (released in March 2006) on the statues, the international reactions to their destruction, and an overview of the controversy. Testimony by local Afghans validates that [[Osama Bin Laden|Osama bin Laden]] ordered the destruction and that, initially, Mullah Omar and the Afghans in Bamiyan opposed it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|date=28 March 2006 |title=Laden ordered Bamyan Buddha destruction |work=[[The Times of India]] |url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/articleshow/1466974.cms |accessdate=6 January 2008 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080506154952/http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/articleshow/1466974.cms |archivedate=6 May 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A novel titled 'An Afghan Winter' provides a fictional backdrop to the destruction of the Buddhas and its impact on the global Buddhist community.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.kirkusreviews.com/book-reviews/rajesh-talwar/afghan-winter/|title=AN AFGHAN WINTER by Rajesh Talwar - Kirkus Reviews|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since 2002, international funding has supported recovery and stabilization efforts at the site. Fragments of the statues are documented and stored with special attention given to securing the structure of the statue still in place. It is hoped that, in the future, partial [[anastylosis]] can be conducted with the remaining fragments. In 2009, [[ICOMOS]] constructed scaffolding within the niche to further conservation and stabilization. Nonetheless, several serious conservation and safety issues exist and the Buddhas are still listed as [[World Heritage in Danger]].&lt;ref&gt;Petzet, Michael (2010). "Safeguarding the Buddhas of Bamiyan". In Christoph Machat, Michael Petzet and John Ziesemer (Eds.), {{cite web |url=http://www.international.icomos.org/risk/world_report/2008-2010/H@R_2008-2010_final.pdf |title=Heritage at Risk: ICOMOS World Report 2008-2010 on Monuments and Sites in Danger}}. Berlin: hendrik Bäßler verlag, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the summer of 2006, Afghan officials were deciding on the timetable for the re-construction of the statues. As they wait for the Afghan government and international community to decide when to rebuild them, a $1.3 million UNESCO-funded project is sorting out the chunks of clay and plaster—ranging from boulders weighing several tons to fragments the size of tennis balls—and sheltering them from the elements.

The Buddhist remnants at Bamiyan were included on the 2008 [[World Monuments Watch]] List of the 100 Most Endangered Sites by the [[World Monuments Fund]].

In 2013, the foot section of the smaller Buddha was rebuilt with iron rods, bricks and concrete by the German branch of ICOMOS.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Martini |first1=Alessandro |last2=Rivetti |first2=Ermanno |date=February 6, 2014 |title=Organisation says actions of German archaeologists who have partially rebuilt one of the statues "border on the criminal" |url=http://www.theartnewspaper.com:80/articles/Unesco-stops-unauthorised-reconstruction-of-Bamiyan-Buddhas/31660 |newspaper=[[The Art Newspaper]] |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150115033225/http://www.theartnewspaper.com/articles/Unesco-stops-unauthorised-reconstruction-of-Bamiyan-Buddhas/31660 |archive-date=15 January 2015 |accessdate=2017-12-17 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Further constructions were halted by order of UNESCO, on the grounds that the work was conducted without the organization's knowledge or approval.

==Discoveries==
[[File:BAMIYAN BUDDHAS - GROTTO PAINTINGS.jpg|thumb|upright=1.3|Grotto painting in 2008]]
After the destruction of the Buddhas, 50 caves were revealed. In 12 of the caves, wall paintings were discovered.&lt;ref name="earth"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.earthtimes.org/articles/show/200569,scientists-discover-first-ever-oil-paintings-in-afghanistan.html|title=Scientitsts discover first-ever oil paintings in Afghanistan|publisher=Earthtimes.org|accessdate=24 April 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; In December 2004, an international team of researchers stated the wall paintings at Bamiyan were painted between the 5th and the 9th centuries, rather than the 6th to 8th centuries, citing their analysis of radioactive isotopes contained in straw fibers found beneath the paintings. It is believed that the paintings were done by artists travelling on the Silk Road, the trade route between [[China]] and the West.&lt;ref name="paint"/&gt;

Scientists from the [[Tokyo Research Institute for Cultural Properties]] in Japan, the [[Centre of Research and Restoration of the French Museums]] in France, the Getty Conservation Institute in the United States, and the [[European Synchrotron Radiation Facility]] (ESRF) in [[Grenoble]], France, analysed samples from the paintings,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2008/04/080422083309.htm|title=Ancient Buddhist Paintings From Bamyan Were Made Of Oil, Hundreds Of Years Before Technique Was 'Invented' In Europe|publisher=Sciencedaily.com|accessdate=24 April 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; typically less than 1&amp;nbsp;mm across.&lt;ref name="nature"/&gt; They discovered that the paint contained [[pigment]]s such as vermilion (red [[mercury sulfide]]) and lead white ([[lead carbonate]]). These were mixed with a range of binders, including natural resins, gums (possibly animal skin glue or egg),&lt;ref name="nature"/&gt; and oils, probably derived from walnuts or poppies.&lt;ref name="paint"/&gt; Specifically, researchers identified drying oils from murals showing Buddhas in vermilion robes sitting cross-legged amid palm leaves and mythical creatures as being painted in the middle of the 7th century.&lt;ref name="earth"/&gt; It is believed that they are the oldest known surviving examples of [[oil painting]], possibly predating oil painting in Europe by as much as six centuries.&lt;ref name="paint"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/earth/main.jhtml?view=DETAILS&amp;grid=&amp;xml=/earth/2008/04/22/sciart122.xml |title=Oil painting invented in Asia, not Europe |publisher=Telegraph.co.uk |accessdate=24 April 2008 |location=London |first=Roger |last=Highfield |date=22 April 2008 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080423165040/http://www.telegraph.co.uk/earth/main.jhtml?view=DETAILS&amp;grid=&amp;xml=%2Fearth%2F2008%2F04%2F22%2Fsciart122.xml |archivedate=23 April 2008 |df=dmy-all }} However, the press release picked up by media, clearly misdates the earliest uses of oil paint in Europe, which is fully described in a treatise by [[Theophilus Presbyter]] of 1100-1120, and may date back to the Ancient Romans. See: Rutherford John Gettens, George Leslie Stout, 1966, Courier Dover Publications, {{ISBN|0-486-21597-0}} [https://books.google.com/books?id=bdQVgKWl3f4C&amp;pg=PA42&amp;dq=oil+painting+Theophilus&amp;sig=oEkZ_FzY5mTDvyXr-FE9GLyZu-o Painting Materials: A Short Encyclopedia (online text)], p. 42 {{cite web |url=http://www.hs-augsburg.de/~harsch/Chronologia/Lspost12/Theophilus/the_da00.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2008-04-29 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080411000138/http://www.hs-augsburg.de/~harsch/Chronologia/Lspost12/Theophilus/the_da00.html |archivedate=11 April 2008 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; The discovery may lead to a reassessment of works in ancient ruins in Iran, China, Pakistan, Turkey, and India.&lt;ref name="paint"/&gt;

Initial suspicion that the oils might be attributable to contamination from fingers, as the touching of the painting is encouraged in Buddhist tradition,&lt;ref name="nature"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nature.com/news/2008/080422/full/news.2008.770.html|title=Ancient Buddhas painted in oils|publisher=nature.com|accessdate=24 April 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; was dispelled by [[spectroscopy]] and [[chromatography]] giving an unambiguous signal for the intentional use of drying oils rather than contaminants.&lt;ref name="nature"/&gt; Oils were discovered underneath layers of paint, unlike surface contaminants.&lt;ref name="nature"/&gt;

Scientists also found the translation of the beginning section of the original [[Sanskrit]] [[Pratītyasamutpāda]] Sutra translated by [[Xuanzang]] that spelled out the basic belief of Buddhism and said all things are transient.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.buddhistchannel.tv/index.php?id=37,3417,0,0,1,0 |title=Secret sutra found in rubble of Bamiyan Buddha |publisher=Buddhistchannel.tv |date=12 November 2006 |accessdate=9 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Another giant statue unearthed===
On 8 September 2008, archaeologists searching for a legendary 300-metre statue at the site announced the discovery of parts of an unknown {{convert|19|m|ft|abbr=off|adj=on}} [[Parinirvana|reclining Buddha]], a pose representing Buddha's [[Parinirvana]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20110820235540/http://afp.google.com/article/ALeqM5iMwnIv89hH3Q7rvdzmDQH9zCL6KA New Bamiyan Buddha find amid destruction], [[Agence France-Presse|AFP]], 8 November 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Restoration==
[[File:Cultural Landscape and Archaeological Remains of the Bamiyan Valley-109153.jpg|thumb|caution sign, 2017]]
The UNESCO Expert Working Group on Afghan cultural projects convened to discuss what to do about the two statues between 3–4 March 2011 in [[Paris]]. Researcher Erwin Emmerling of [[Technical University Munich]] announced he believed it would be possible to restore the smaller statue using an [[Organic compound|organic]] [[silicon]] [[Chemical compound|compound]].&lt;ref name="restoration"&gt;[http://www.aolnews.com/2011/03/01/researchers-say-they-can-restore-1-of-destroyed-bamiyan-buddhas/?icid=maing%7Cmain5%7Cdl1%7Csec1_lnk2%7C47607 Researchers Say They Can Restore 1 of Destroyed Bamiyan Buddhas] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110305032019/http://www.aolnews.com/2011/03/01/researchers-say-they-can-restore-1-of-destroyed-bamiyan-buddhas/?icid=maing%7Cmain5%7Cdl1%7Csec1_lnk2%7C47607 |date=5 March 2011 }}. [[AOL|AOL News]], 1 March 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; The Paris conference issued a list of 39 recommendations for the safeguarding of the Bamiyan site. These included leaving the larger Western niche empty as a monument to the destruction of the Buddhas, a feasibility study into the rebuilding of the Eastern Buddha, and the construction of a central museum and several smaller site museums.&lt;ref&gt;[http://whc.unesco.org/en/news/749 Expert Working Group releases recommendations for Safeguarding Bamiyan] 27 April 2011&lt;/ref&gt; Work has since begun on restoring the Buddhas using the process of [[anastylosis]], where original elements are combined with modern material. It is estimated that roughly half the pieces of the Buddhas can be put back together according to Bert Praxenthaler, a German art historian and sculptor involved in the restoration. The restoration of the caves and Buddhas has also involved training and employing local people as stone carvers.&lt;ref&gt;Graham-Harison, Emma (16 May 2012)[https://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/may/16/stone-carvers-taliban-bamiyan ''Stone carvers defy Taliban to return to the Bamiyan valley''] The Guardian&lt;/ref&gt; The project, which also aims to encourage tourism to the area, is being organised by UNESCO and the [[International Council on Monuments and Sites]] (ICOMOS).

The work has come under some criticism. It is felt by some, such as human rights activist Abdullah Hamadi, that the empty niches should be left as monuments to the fanaticism of the Taliban, while [[NPR]] reported that others believe the money could be better spent on housing and electricity for the region.&lt;ref name="NPR"&gt;{{cite news|last=Kakissis|first=Joanna|title=Bit By Bit, Afghanistan Rebuilds Buddhist Statues|url=https://www.npr.org/2011/07/27/137304363/bit-by-bit-afghanistan-rebuilds-buddhist-statues?ft=1&amp;f=1004|accessdate=22 April 2013|newspaper=National Public Radio|date=27 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some people, including Habiba Sarabi, the provincial governor, believe that rebuilding the Buddhas would increase tourism which would aid the surrounding communities.&lt;ref name="NPR" /&gt;

===Rise of Buddhas with 3D light projection===
After fourteen years, on 7 June 2015, a Chinese adventurist couple Xinyu Zhang and Hong Liang filled the empty cavities where the Buddhas once stood with [[Three-dimensional space (mathematics)|3D]] [[laser light]] projection technology. The projector used for the installation, worth approximately $120,000, was donated by Xinyu and Hong, who were saddened by the destruction of the statues. With the desire of paying tribute, they requested permission from [[UNESCO]] and the [[Afghan government]] to do the project. About 150 local people came out to see the unveiling of the [[holographic]] statues on Sunday, 7 June 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= Mary-Ann Russon|url=http://www.ibtimes.co.uk/buddha-statues-destroyed-by-taliban-resurrected-laser-projections-1505794 |title= Afghanistan: Buddhas of Bamiyan resurrected as laser projections | publisher=International Business Times |date= 12 June 2015| accessdate= 16 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= PAULA MEJIA|url=http://www.newsweek.com/afghanistan-buddha-statues-destroyed-taliban-reimagined-holograms-343113 |title= Afghanistan Buddha Statues Destroyed by Taliban Reimagined as Holograms | publisher=News Week |date= 15 June 2015| accessdate= 16 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''computer program''' is a collection of [[instruction set|instructions]]&lt;ref name="aup-ch4-p132"&gt;{{cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt; that performs a specific task when [[execution (computing)|executed]] by a [[computer]]. A computer requires programs to function.

A computer program is usually written by a [[computer programmer]] in a [[programming language]]. From the program in its human-readable form of [[source code]], a [[compiler]] can derive [[machine code]]—a form consisting of instructions that the computer can directly execute. Alternatively, a computer program may be executed with the aid of an [[interpreter (computing)|interpreter]].

A collection of computer programs, [[Library (computing)|libraries]], and related [[Data (computing)|data]] are referred to as [[software]]. Computer programs may be categorized along functional lines, such as [[application software]] and [[system software]].  The underlying method used for some calculation or manipulation is known as an [[algorithm]].

==History==
{{See also|History of computing|History of programming languages|History of software}}

===Early programmable machines===
The earliest programmable machines preceded the [[History of computing hardware|invention of the digital computer]]. In 1801, [[Joseph-Marie Jacquard]] devised a [[Jacquard loom|loom]] that would weave a pattern by following a series of perforated cards. Patterns could be woven and repeated by arranging the cards.&lt;ref name="eniac-ch1-p16"&gt;{{cite book

===Analytical Engine===
[[File:Diagram for the computation of Bernoulli numbers.jpg|thumb|right|Lovelace's diagram from Note G, the [[Ada Lovelace#First computer program|first published computer algorithm]] ]]
In 1837, [[Charles Babbage]] was inspired by Jacquard's loom to attempt to build the [[Analytical Engine]].&lt;ref name="eniac-ch1-p16"/&gt;
The names of the components of the calculating device were borrowed from the textile industry. In the textile industry, yarn was brought from the store to be milled. The device would have had a "store"—memory to hold 1,000 numbers of 40 decimal digits each.  Numbers from the "store" would then have then been transferred to the "mill" (analogous to the CPU of a modern machine), for processing. It was programmed using two sets of perforated cards—one to direct the operation and the other for the input variables.&lt;ref name="eniac-ch1-p16"/&gt;

During a nine-month period in 1842–43, [[Ada Lovelace]] translated the memoir of Italian mathematician [[Luigi Menabrea]]. The memoir covered the Analytical Engine. The translation contained Note G which completely detailed a method for calculating [[Bernoulli number]]s using the Analytical Engine. This note is recognized by some historians as the world's first written computer program.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|author1 = J. Fuegi |author2 =J.

===Universal Turing machine===
In 1936, [[Alan Turing]] introduced the [[Universal Turing machine]]—a theoretical device that can model every computation that can be performed on a [[Turing complete]] computing machine.&lt;ref name="discrete-ch10-p654"&gt;{{cite book

It is a [[finite-state machine]] that has an infinitely long read/write tape. The machine can move the tape back and forth, changing its contents as it performs an [[algorithm]]. The machine starts in the initial state, goes through a sequence of steps, and halts when it encounters the halt state.&lt;ref name="formal_languages-ch9-p234"&gt;{{cite book

This machine is considered by some to be the origin of the [[stored-program computer]]—used by [[John von Neumann]] (1946) for the "Electronic Computing Instrument" that now bears the [[von Neumann architecture]] name.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

===Early programmable computers===
The [[Z3 (computer)|Z3 computer]], invented by [[Konrad Zuse]] (1941) in [[Germany]], was a digital and programmable computer.&lt;ref name="hoc-zuse"&gt;{{cite web
  | url = http://history-computer.com/ModernComputer/Relays/Zuse.html
  | title = History of Computing
}}&lt;/ref&gt; A digital computer uses electricity as the calculating component. The Z3 contained 2,400 relays to create the [[Electronic circuit|circuits]]. The circuits provided a [[Binary code|binary]], [[floating-point]], nine-instruction computer. Programming the Z3 was through a specially designed keyboard and [[punched tape]].

The [[ENIAC|Electronic Numerical Integrator And Computer]] (Fall 1945) was a [[Turing complete]], general-purpose computer that used 17,468 [[vacuum tube]]s to create the [[Electronic circuit|circuits]]. At its core, it was a series of [[Pascaline]]s wired together.&lt;ref name="eniac-ch5-p102"&gt;{{cite book

Programming the ENIAC took up to two months.&lt;ref name="eniac-ch5-p102"/&gt; Three function tables were on wheels and needed to be rolled to fixed function panels. Function tables were connected to function panels using heavy black cables. Each function table had 728 rotating knobs. Programming the ENIAC also involved setting some of the 3,000 switches. Debugging a program took a week.&lt;ref name="eniac-ch5-p102"/&gt;  The programmers of the ENIAC were women who were known collectively as the "ENIAC girls."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://gender.stanford.edu/news/2011/researcher-reveals-how-“computer-geeks”-replaced-“computergirls”|title=Researcher reveals how “Computer Geeks” replaced “Computer Girls”|last=Frink|first=Brenda D.|date=1 June 2011|website=Gender News|publisher=Stanford University|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150312130252/http:/gender.stanford.edu/news/2011/researcher-reveals-how-%E2%80%9Ccomputer-geeks%E2%80%9D-replaced-%E2%80%9Ccomputergirls%E2%80%9D|archive-date=12 March 2015|dead-url=|access-date=22 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ENIAC featured [[Parallel computing|parallel operations]]. Different sets of accumulators could simultaneously work on different algorithms. It used [[Punched card|punched card machines]] for input and output, and it was controlled with a [[clock signal]]. It ran for eight years, calculating hydrogen bomb parameters, predicting weather patterns, and producing firing tables to aim artillery guns. 

The [[Manchester Small-Scale Experimental Machine]] (June 1948) was a [[stored-program computer]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |last=Enticknap |first=Nicholas |title=Computing's Golden Jubilee |journal=Resurrection |issue=20 |publisher=The Computer Conservation Society |date=Summer 1998 |url=http://www.cs.man.ac.uk/CCS/res/res20.htm#d |issn=0958-7403 |accessdate=19 April 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Programming transitioned away from moving cables and setting dials; instead, a computer program was stored in memory as numbers. Only three [[bit]]s of memory were available to store each instruction, so it was limited to eight instructions. 32 switches were available for programming.

===Later computers===
[[File:Dg-nova3.jpg|thumb|Switches for manual input on a [[Data General Nova]] 3, manufactured in the mid-1970s]]
Computers manufactured until the 1970s had front-panel switches for programming. The computer program was written on paper for reference. An instruction was represented by a configuration of on/off settings. After setting the configuration, an execute button was pressed. This process was then repeated. Computer programs also were manually input via [[paper tape]] or [[punched cards]]. After the medium was loaded, the starting address was set via switches and the execute button pressed.&lt;ref name="osc-ch1-p6"&gt;{{cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1961, the [[Burroughs large systems#B5000|Burroughs B5000]] was built specifically to be programmed in the [[ALGOL 60]] language. The hardware featured circuits to ease the [[compiler|compile]] phase.&lt;ref name="sco-ch1-p20"&gt;{{cite book

In 1964, the [[IBM System/360]] was a line of six computers each having the same [[instruction set|instruction set architecture]]. The Model 30 was the smallest and least expensive. Customers could upgrade and retain the same [[application software]].&lt;ref name="sco-ch1-p21"&gt;{{cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Each System/360 model featured [[Computer multitasking#Multiprogramming|multiprogramming]]. With operating system support, multiple programs could be in memory at once. When one was waiting for [[input/output]], another could compute. Each model also could [[emulator|emulate]] other computers. Customers could upgrade to the System/360 and retain their [[IBM 7090#IBM 7094|IBM 7094]] or [[IBM 1401]] application software.&lt;ref name="sco-ch1-p21"/&gt;

==Computer programming==
{{Main|Computer programming}}

[[Computer programming]] is the process of writing or editing [[source code]]. Editing source code involves testing, analyzing, refining, and sometimes coordinating with other programmers on a jointly developed program. A person who practices this skill is referred to as a computer [[programmer]], software developer, and sometimes coder.

The sometimes lengthy process of computer programming is usually referred to as [[software development]]. The term [[software engineering]] is becoming popular as the process is seen as an [[engineering]] discipline.

===Programming languages===
{{main|Programming language}}
[[File:Object-Oriented-Programming-Methods-And-Classes-with-Inheritance.png|thumb|A computer program written in the imperative programming style]]

Computer programs can be categorized by the [[programming language]] [[programming paradigm|paradigm]] used to produce them. Two of the main paradigms are [[imperative programming|imperative]] and [[declarative language|declarative]].

====Imperative languages====
''Imperative programming languages'' specify a sequential [[algorithm#Computer algorithm|algorithm]] using declarations, expressions, and statements:&lt;ref name="cpl-ch4-75"&gt;{{cite book
  | last = Wilson
  | first = Leslie B.
  | title = Comparative Programming Languages, Second Edition
  | publisher = Addison-Wesley
  | year = 1993
  | page = 75
  | isbn = 0-201-56885-3
}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* A ''declaration'' couples a [[variable (programming)|variable]] name to a [[datatype]] – for example: &lt;code&gt; var x: integer; &lt;/code&gt;
* An ''expression'' yields a value – for example: &lt;code&gt; 2 + 2 &lt;/code&gt; yields 4
* A ''statement'' might assign an expression to a variable or use the value of a variable to alter the program's [[control flow]] – for example: &lt;code&gt;x := 2 + 2; if x = 4 then do_something();&lt;/code&gt;

One criticism of imperative languages is the side effect of an assignment statement on a class of variables called non-local variables.&lt;ref name="cpl-ch9-213" /&gt;

====Declarative languages====
''Declarative programming languages'' describe ''what'' computation should be performed and not ''how'' to compute it. Declarative programs omit the [[control flow]] and are considered ''sets'' of instructions. Two broad categories of declarative languages are [[functional language]]s and [[logical language]]s. The principle behind functional languages (like [[Haskell (programming language)|Haskell]]) is to not allow [[side effect (computer science)|side effects]], which makes it easier to reason about programs like mathematical functions.&lt;ref name="cpl-ch9-213"&gt;{{cite book
  | last = Wilson
  | first = Leslie B.
  | title = Comparative Programming Languages, Second Edition
  | publisher = Addison-Wesley
  | year = 1993
  | page = 213
  | isbn = 0-201-56885-3
}}&lt;/ref&gt; The principle behind logical languages (like [[Prolog]]) is to define the problem to be solved&amp;nbsp;– the goal&amp;nbsp;– and leave the detailed solution to the Prolog system itself.&lt;ref name="cpl-ch10-244"&gt;{{cite book
  | last = Wilson
  | first = Leslie B.
  | title = Comparative   Programming Languages, Second Edition
  | publisher = Addison-Wesley
  | year = 1993
  | page = 244
  | isbn = 0-201-56885-3
}}&lt;/ref&gt; The goal is defined by providing a list of subgoals. Then each subgoal is defined by further providing a list of its subgoals, etc. If a path of subgoals fails to find a solution, then that subgoal is [[backtracking|backtracked]] and another path is systematically attempted.

===Compilation and interpretation===
A computer program in the form of a [[human-readable]], computer programming language is called [[source code]]. Source code may be converted into an [[Executable file|executable image]] by a [[compiler]] or [[execution (computing)|executed]] immediately with the aid of an [[Interpreter (computing)|interpreter]].

Compilers are used to translate source code from a programming language into either [[Object file|object code]] or [[machine code]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=What is a Compiler?|url=http://lambda.uta.edu/cse5317/notes/node3.html|accessdate=2012-01-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Object code needs further processing to become machine code, and machine code consists of the [[central processing unit|central processing unit's]] native instructions, ready for execution. Compiled computer programs are commonly referred to as executables, binary images, or simply as [[Binary file|binaries]]&amp;nbsp;– a reference to the [[Binary numeral system|binary]] [[file format]] used to store the executable code.

Interpreters are used to execute source code from a programming language line-by-line. The interpreter [[Parsing|decodes]] each [[Statement (computer science)|statement]] and performs its behavior. One advantage of interpreters is that they can easily be extended to an [[REPL|interactive session]]. The programmer is presented with a prompt, and individual lines of code are typed in and performed immediately.

The main disadvantage of interpreters is computer programs run slower than when compiled. Interpreting code is slower because the interpreter must decode each statement and then perform it. However, software development may be faster using an interpreter because testing is immediate when the compiling step is omitted. Another disadvantage of interpreters is an interpreter must be present on the executing computer. By contrast, compiled computer programs need no compiler present during execution.

[[just-in-time compilation|Just in time compilers]] pre-compile computer programs just before execution. For example, the Java [[virtual machine#Process virtual machines|virtual machine]] Hotspot contains a Just In Time Compiler which selectively compiles Java bytecode into machine code - but only code which Hotspot predicts is likely to be used many times.

Either compiled or interpreted programs might be executed in a [[batch processing|batch process]] without human interaction.

[[Scripting language]]s are often used to create batch processes. One common scripting language is [[Unix shell]], and its executing environment is called the [[command-line interface]].

No properties of a programming language require it to be exclusively compiled or exclusively interpreted. The categorization usually reflects the most popular method of language execution. For example, Java is thought of as an interpreted language and C a compiled language, despite the existence of Java compilers and C interpreters.

==Storage and execution==
[[File:Papertape3.jpg|thumb|In the 1950s, computer programs were stored on [[Punched tape|perforated paper tape]] ]]

Typically, computer programs are stored in [[non-volatile memory]] until requested either directly or indirectly to be [[execution (computing)|executed]] by the computer user. Upon such a request, the program is loaded into [[random-access memory]], by a computer program called an [[operating system]], where it can be accessed directly by the central processor. The central processor then executes ("runs") the program, instruction by instruction, until termination. A program in execution is called a [[process (computing)|process]].&lt;ref name="osc-ch4-97"&gt;{{cite book

  | page = 97
  | isbn = 0-201-50480-4
}}&lt;/ref&gt; Termination is either by normal self-termination or by error&amp;nbsp;– software or hardware error.

===Simultaneous execution===
{{See also|Process (computing)|Multiprocessing}}

Many operating systems support [[computer multitasking|multitasking]] which enables many computer programs to appear to run simultaneously on one computer.  Operating systems may run multiple programs through [[process scheduling]]&amp;nbsp;– a software mechanism to [[context switch|switch]] the [[Central processing unit|CPU]] among processes often so users can [[time-sharing|interact]] with each program while it runs.&lt;ref name="osc-ch4-100"&gt;{{cite book

  | isbn = 0-9764832-4-6
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Self-modifying programs===
{{Main|Self-modifying code}}

A computer program in [[execution (computing)|execution]] is normally treated as being different from the [[Data (computing)|data]] the program operates on. However, in some cases, this distinction is blurred when a computer program modifies itself. The modified computer program is subsequently executed as part of the same program. [[Self-modifying code]] is possible for programs written in [[machine code]], [[assembly language]], [[Lisp (programming language)|Lisp]], [[C (programming language)|C]], [[COBOL]], [[PL/1]], and [[Prolog]].

==Functional categories==
Computer programs may be categorized along functional lines. The main functional categories are [[application software]] and [[system software]]. System software includes the [[operating system]] which couples [[computer hardware]] with application software.&lt;ref name="osc-overview"/&gt; The purpose of the operating system is to provide an environment in which application software executes in a convenient and efficient manner.&lt;ref name="osc-overview"&gt;{{cite book
  | last = Silberschatz
  | first = Abraham
  | title = Operating System Concepts, Fourth Edition
  | publisher = Addison-Wesley
  | year = 1994
  | page = 1
  | isbn = 0-201-50480-4
}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to the operating system, system software includes [[Firmware|embedded programs]], [[Booting|boot programs]], and [[Microcode|micro programs]]. Application software designed for [[end user]]s have a [[Interface (computing)|user interface]]. Application software not designed for the end user includes [[middleware]], which couples one application with another. Application software also includes [[Utility software|utility programs]]. The distinction between system software and application software is under debate.

===Application software===
{{Main|Application software}}
[[File:Gcalctool-scientific.png|thumb|Example of an app: [[GCalctool]], a software calculator]]

There are many types of application software:
* The word '''app''' came to being in 21st century. It is a [[Clipping (morphology)|clipping]] of the word "application". They have been designed for many platforms, but the word was first used for smaller mobile apps. Desktop apps are traditional computer programs that run on [[desktop computer]]s. [[Mobile app]]s run on [[mobile device]]s. [[Web app]]s run inside a [[web browser]]. Both mobile and desktop apps may be downloaded from the developers' website or purchased from [[app store]]s such as [[Microsoft Store (digital)|Microsoft Store]], [[Apple App Store]], [[Mac App Store]], [[Google Play]] or [[Intel AppUp]].
* An '''[[application suite]]''' consists of multiple applications bundled together. Examples include [[Microsoft Office]], [[LibreOffice]], and [[iWork]]. They bundle a word processor, spreadsheet, and other applications.
* '''[[Enterprise software|Enterprise applications]]''' bundle accounting, personnel, customer, and vendor applications. Examples include [[enterprise resource planning]], [[customer relationship management]], and [[supply chain management software]].
* '''Enterprise infrastructure software''' supports the enterprise's [[software systems]]. Examples include databases, email servers, and network servers.
* '''[[Information worker]] software''' are designed for workers at the departmental level. Examples include [[time management]], [[schedule (workplace)|resource management]], analytical, collaborative and documentation tools. Word processors, spreadsheets, email and blog clients, personal information system, and individual media editors may aid in multiple information worker tasks.
* '''Media development software''' generates print and electronic media for others to consume, most often in a commercial or educational setting. These produce graphics, publications, animations, and videos.
* '''Product engineering software''' is used to help develop large machines and other application software. Examples includes [[computer-aided design]] (CAD), [[computer-aided engineering]] (CAE), and [[integrated development environment]]s.
* '''Entertainment Software''' can refer to video games, movie recorders and players, and music recorders and players.

===Utility programs===
[[Utility software|Utility programs]] are application programs designed to aid [[system administrator]]s and [[computer programmer]]s.

===Operating system===
{{See also|Operating system}}

An [[operating system]] is a computer program that acts as an intermediary between a user of a computer and the computer hardware.
&lt;ref name="osc-overview"/&gt;

In the 1950s, the programmer, who was also the operator, would write a program and run it.&lt;ref name="osc-ch1-p6"/&gt;
After the program finished executing, the output may have been printed, or it may have been punched onto paper tape or cards for later processing.&lt;ref name="osc-ch1-p6"/&gt;
More often than not the program did not work.
&lt;ref name="sco-ch1-p11"&gt;{{cite book
  | last = Tanenbaum
  | first = Andrew S.
  | title = Structured Computer Organization, Third Edition
  | publisher = Prentice Hall
  | year = 1990
  | page = 11
  | isbn = 0-13-854662-2
}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The programmer then looked at the console lights and fiddled with the console switches. If less fortunate, a memory printout was made for further study.&lt;ref name="sco-ch1-p11"/&gt;
In the 1960s, programmers reduced the amount of wasted time by automating the operator's job.&lt;ref name="sco-ch1-p11"/&gt; A program called an ''operating system'' was kept in the computer at all times.&lt;ref name="sco-ch1-p11"/&gt;

Originally, operating systems were programmed in [[assembly language|assembly]]; however, modern operating systems are typically written in [[C (programming language)|C]].

===Boot program===
A [[stored-program computer]] requires an initial computer program stored in its [[read-only memory]] to [[booting|boot]]. The boot process is to identify and initialize all aspects of the system, from [[processor register]]s to [[device driver|device controllers]] to [[volatile memory|memory]] contents.&lt;ref name="osc-ch2-p30"&gt;{{cite book
  | last = Silberschatz
  | first = Abraham
  | title = Operating System Concepts, Fourth Edition
  | publisher = Addison-Wesley
  | year = 1994
  | page = 30
  | isbn = 0-201-50480-4
}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following the initialization process, this initial computer program loads the [[operating system]] and sets the [[program counter]] to begin normal operations.

===Embedded programs===
[[File:USB flash drive.JPG|thumb|230px|right|The [[microcontroller]] on the right of this [[USB flash drive]] is controlled with embedded [[firmware]].]]

Independent of the host computer, a [[Peripheral|hardware device]] might have embedded [[firmware]] to control its operation. Firmware is used when the computer program is rarely or never expected to change, or when the program must not be lost when the power is off.&lt;ref name="sco-ch1-p11"/&gt;

===Microcode programs===
{{main|Microcode}}

[[Microcode]] programs control some [[central processing unit]]s and some other hardware. This code moves data between the [[Processor register|registers]], [[Bus (computing)|buses]], [[arithmetic logic unit]]s, and other functional units in the CPU.  Unlike conventional programs, microcode is not usually written by, or even visible to, the end users of systems, and is usually provided by the manufacturer, and is considered internal to the device.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8092">'''COSMOS''' stands for "'''COSMetic Organic and Natural Standard'''", which sets certification requirements for [[Organic product|organic]] and [[Natural product|natural]] [[cosmetics]] products in the [[Europe]]. The standard is recognized globally by the [[cosmetic industry]]. By adhering to specific guidelines, cosmetics marketers can use COSMOS signatures, which are registered [[trademark]]s, on packaging to confirm the products meet minimum industry requirements to be considered organic or natural.&lt;ref name="Cosper-Understanding-COSMOS"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Alex|first1=Cosper|title=Understanding COSMOS - the COSMetics organic and natural standard|url=https://www.desjardin.fr/en/blog/understanding-cosmos-the-cosmetics-organic-and-natural-standard|publisher=Desjardin|accessdate=30 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

In 2002 five European organisations responsible for setting organic and natural cosmetics [[International standard|standard]]s met at a trade show to share ideas for broader standards to be used globally. These five COSMOS members are:

* BDIH (Germany)
* Cosmebio (France)
* [[Ecocert]] Greenlife SAS (France)
* ICEA (Italy)
* [[Soil Association]] (Great Britain)
Over 1,600 [[manufacturer]]s who sell over 25,000 products across over 45 countries follow the standard, according to Cosmos-standard.org. About 85% of the certified cosmetics industry uses COSMOS signatures on its products.

Although the five members differed on certain standards separately, they were able to smooth out differences to create a harmonised international standard that was first published in 2010. At this time the five members formed a non-profit international association overseeing the standard. In June 2010 the COSMOS-standard AISBL was awarded [[Royal Assent]] from [[Belgium#Politics|Belgian authorities]]. The documents published with the standard include:

* The Control Manual: describes how the control systems works
* The Labeling Rules: explains how to use COSMOS labels
* The Technical Guide: additional information&lt;ref name="The COSMOS-standard"&gt;{{cite web|title=The COSMOS-standard|url=https://cosmos-standard.org/the-cosmos-standard/|publisher=COSMOS-standard AISBL|accessdate=30 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Cosper-Understanding-COSMOS" /&gt;

==Certification and Labeling Process==

There are four main [[certification]] signatures that comprise the COSMOS-standard, which are for ORGANIC, NATURAL, COSMOS CERTIFIED and COSMOS APPROVED products. Here are six steps to gaining approval of product labeling within the certification process:

# The authorized COSMOS-standard certification body must first approve of the product specification. 
# 
# The applicant must submit their proposed product labeling to the certification body and await approval. Generic label designs for certain single-ingredient product are acceptable if the design is consistent for all products.
# 
# In the event the product specification is not approved first, the labeling can only get provisional approval.
# 
# Only after full approval of the labeling is granted by the certification body can the manufacturer print the labelling. The certification process must be completed before the labels can be used commercially. 
# 
# If the manufacturer needs to make changes to the product or labeling after gaining certification, they must notify the certification body and wait for written approval or a certificate update. Further approval from the certification body will be needed if the manufacturer makes changes to the organic percentage of the ingredients. The vendor will also have to make an amendment to the ingredients. 
# 
# Before the product can be launched, the labeling must be approved by the certification body and the product must be listed on the COSMOS-standard certificate. Printing labels without first getting approval can lead to certification withdrawal if the certification body determines the products and labels are non-compliant.&lt;ref name="CosmosStandard-PDF"&gt;{{cite web|title=COSMOS-standard Cosmetics organic and natural standard Version 2.0 – 21st October 2013|url=https://cosmosstandard.files.wordpress.com/2014/08/cosmos-standard-v2-21102013.pdf|publisher=COSMOS-standard AISBL|accessdate=30 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="COSMOS-Technical"&gt;{{cite web|title=COSMOS-standard Technical Guide Version 2.11 09/05/2017|url=https://cosmosstandard.files.wordpress.com/2017/08/cosmos20technical20guide20v2-1120090517202.pdf|publisher=COSMOS-standard AISBL|accessdate=30 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Basic Labeling Requirements==

Manufacturers and marketers are only allowed to use COSMOS terms and signatures for products authorized by the certification body. The certification body must be identified on product labels if it is not clearly mentioned anywhere else on the product. In cases in which the label size restricts product labeling, the certification body may allow flexibility as long as the product maintains the general principles of the Labeling Guide. The firm must at least mention the nature of the certification (such as organic or natural) and the identity of the certification body.&lt;ref name="COSMOS-Labeling"&gt;{{cite web|title=COSMOS-standard Labelling Guide Version 2.4 – 28 June 2017|url=https://cosmosstandard.files.wordpress.com/2017/07/cosmos-standard20labelling20guide20v2-420280617.pdf|publisher=COSMOS-standard AISBL|accessdate=30 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Product Identification==

Marketers are allowed to use the COSMOS terms and signatures on company letterhead and websites under certain conditions. All the products of a brand must be certified organic in order for the company to make the claim they are "COSMOS ORGANIC certified." Otherwise, the firm must be clear that only specific products have been certified organic. In other words, the use of the terms and signatures must not be misleading to the consumer.

Essentially, the labelling must clearly and accurately describe the product, which must comply with the standard. The marketer must avoid listing ingredients or naming the product in a way that implies it contains certain ingredients that are not present. Any use or branding of the term "organic," for example, must comply with the organic standard and not be confusing to the consumer.

The [[labeling]] must not confuse the terms "organic" and "natural," which have separate definitions and certifications based on the way the products and ingredients are processed. If a brand sells several organic products and a few natural products, they must make it clear in their labeling and marketing the differences. The firm must also be clear if some of its products have no certification at all. In other words, in order for a company to promote itself as "COSMOS ORGANIC certified," its entire range of products must meet the organic standard and be certified.

Companies are not allowed to use [[logo]]s or seals that may mislead customers into believing the products are COSMOS certified.&lt;ref name="CosmosStandard-PDF" /&gt;&lt;ref name="COSMOS-Labeling" /&gt;

{{Costume}}

'''Costume coordination''' is a method of dressing actors, employees or a person or group for theatrical productions and any venue requiring a fully realized character. It consists of pulling or renting existing stock clothing and [[costume]]s, altering them as needed to be used as [[stage clothes]] in a theatrical production, oversee their use, cleaning and eventual return to storage or rental company.&lt;ref name="Amateur"&gt;{{cite book | title=The Complete Idiot's Guide to Amateur Theatricals | publisher=Alpha | author=Kenrick, John | date=September 5, 2006 | pages=109 | isbn=978-1592575060}}&lt;/ref&gt; Just as with [[costume design]], the costume creates the over all appearance of the characters, but with the use of on hand items, including accessories. Sometimes coordinators may have a small budget to augment the existing stock or alter it for production needs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=ShowSmarts: A Volunteer's Guide to Putting on Shows with Kids | publisher=iUniverse, Inc. | author=Koerpel, Terra | date=October 20, 2004 | pages=35 | isbn=978-0595318834}}{{Self-published inline|certain=yes|date=January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many theatres with smaller budgets regularly reuse existing stock, especially older companies with large costume warehouses. It is also a staple of community theatre positions because it entails less time and effort and is the usual manner for schools to costume student performers from stored costumes donated or previously purchased.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=For Love of Drama: How to Create School Plays that Show a Profit and Erupt with Life and Love | publisher=Trafford Publishing | author=McEwen, Rolf | date=July 19, 2004 | isbn=978-1412031653}}{{Self-published inline|certain=yes|date=January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Coordination of costumes is also required at theme parks and festivals which require performers and dancers to have a consistent appearance, or maintained as originally designed.

==Celebrity Costumes==
There are costumes made for film and theater, but it is also made show off popular looks to fans and friends on the red carpet or other fancy places. 
Discovered by INSIDER articles, celebrity women tend to dress or half dress for that manner, when they are not filming or doing production. These specific locations are places like, the Red Carpet, Engagement photos, Music Awards, VMA's, Venice Film Festival, and the Grammy's. This isn't a bashing statement, it is an honoring one. Celebrity women are constantly recognized for what they are wearing outside of the professional/ business atmosphere. These celebrity women are praised by their glam and style. They become more iconic for their stunning appearances at these elegant events. These outfits and designs are still in some way a costume because it's making up a certain character. As mentioned in Jorgensen book, famous designer Edith Head says, a celebrity wears different costumes to become someone different. The clothing chosen by designers for celebrities are the gifts of celebration, style and beauty.(Pantazi, Chloe 2017)

==Costume Trends==
The fashion and costumes that are used in movies and theater actually have an effect on fashion shows and fans. These examples are seen on social media and common blogs. Some films are enjoyable by genres but others are memorable because of costumes. There are many specific designs and costumes that are used in production that valued and inspiring to most people today. Designers such as Keira Knightley and Audrey Hepburn have made many designs for films that are or have been in high fashion in reality. A few movies to think about and idealize are, Cinderella where there were much patients and dedication with the amounts of fabric used and the number of designers that worked on the dress. A few others, Mad Max Fury World, the designer received an Oscar for creating the costume for the character who Imperator Furiosa,; Atonement, where the green dress worn in the film was to illustrate jealousy and temptation. One other film would be Kill Bill, where the character The Bride played a strong roll and needed an even stronger costume to go with it. There are plenty of other movies and famous designers to read into along with different awards won for the costumes. (Fearn, Rebecca; 2016) Movie costumes can definitely become a trend in reality. For an example, the film where, Marilyn Monroe wore a white halterneck dress standing over a subway vent and how it became so popular because how beautiful it was or how correctly it was worn. It also left a message telling women "how to really wear it." Costumes in film or stage have the ability to have some sort of an effect on fashion in society. To go through the list of top designs more, ''The Matrix'' where they wore trench coats and shades to build a serious character. ''Factory Girl'' being another film which shows exaggeration in the costumes for that time frame. One famous and popular film mentioned would be ''Cleopatra'', where the designer Renle made very creative and unique costumes. The designer didn't use accurate costumes to tell the story but what made the film interesting was the fun that the designers and directors put into it. (Clough, Rebecca 2014)

==Famous Designers==
There are many famous designers that are left behind the scene and aren't always recognized for their work but some have significantly made it into the spotlight. Many designers began sewing when they are young and they would start off with small creations. Edith Head for an example is now as "The Greastest Costume Designer". In much news there are plenty of designers that have books written about them and their own websites of their designs. Edith Head had designed not only for herself but many other top celebrities like Grace Kelly. Sandy Powell is another known designer who talks about the particular work of a designer and the pressure. There are a lot of designs for a  designer to complete and there isn't always enough time and sketches that need to be made for actors and directors preferences. In Head's words actors and actresses uses their fashion/costumes as a "camouflage" to indicate that they are a different person every time they are seen (Jorgensen 2010). Another designer is Kate Carin who does much work in South Africa. She has her own website that features her designs in films like, ''Saints and Strangers, Cape Town, The 51st State, Strongbow, The book of Negroes'' and the list goes on. This website talks about Carin's designs along with her relationships with directors; this is numerously stated in other research, mentioning the connection between the two. It also talks about her versatile style with being about to design costumes for commercials and also for period movies that takes research (Carin).

==Reading Costumes==
There is a lot of production and preparation used in a film so it's important to know how to read these costumes. There are popular costumes used in the 1300-1500s and also modern day costumes. These costumes discuss what certain costumes have and what does it mean. It also point out specific ways to educate oneself on the way costumes are used. There's a director of a costume organization  named, Deborah Landis that who suggest helping students and teachers to appreciate costume designs more. The article digs in a little deeper, particularly focusing on media literacy and observation. It talks  about the collaborations between costume designers, directors, and cinematographer. The article is similar to "Role of Importance" by differentiating between fashion and costume designers but this article has more depth. It begins with saying fashion designers have labels to sell their designs while costume designers have no label and they simply make characters. Again there's a lot of research costume designers done to make a perfect character; visiting places that are still standing, learning habits of the culture, collecting photos and so on. Costume designers use portraits to match their sketches. She continues after each section of telling what costume designer does along with providing assignments to teachers for students (Landis 2018).

For many people, costumes have importance. Costumes are made to make and invent a character in a film or play. Popular movies like "Romeo and Juliet" , "Hamlet" , and so on; are very collaborative movies that people constantly describe each significant style and fabric that a character is wearing throughout the film. These films are known for their heavy leather, lacquer red silk and all other things that were embedded into a costume, and other things made to represent those ages. There's a lot that goes into a costume according to this book, you have to select the fabric, cut out the costume, make sure it fits, and aging the costume which is making it look older by spraying it down with different things or painting over it. After the end of designing the costumes, it is then presented to the director for approval. Along with most costumes there are props to finish off a personality like knives, pistols, crowns, etc. depending on a character's role. These decisions are made by both the director and costume designer to give characters purposes in stories.(Motley 1965)
 
There's a book that highly discuss renaissance costumes called,  "Settings and Costumes of the Modern Stage". This book doesn't just give information and photos about Costumes but also the stage and the setup to help with bringing characters to life. This information will be helpful because it gives costume designers their credit for their designs. The article discusses stage and costume connection, to help readers understand how costumes match the story/plot. This book has more pictures than words but it helps to create the understanding of a scene, story, and character. The book shows many photos and descriptions of plays like: Hamlet, Marriage, Resurrection, and so on. Authors, Simonson and Komisarjevsky also briefly mention the way New York Stage has made its changes in certain settings to a more glamorous fairy-tales (Simonson, Lee 1966). As mentioned above, there should be more appreciation for the work put into costumes. Even the simplest costumes that are in different genres affects a costume and tell a story. In science fiction it makes sense for directors and designers to dress up characters to create a fantasy and make it less compromising to relate. The film ''Tron Legacy'' where the colors of their costumes play big roles in the film and within the characters. These colors are specifically used to distinguish between the protagonist and antagonist. In ''Scott Pilgrim vs. the World'', costumes indicate the enemy characters in this film that are called the seven villains. The costumes used in ''Robin Hood'', was to connect to a certain time period of heroes of men that was formed in the medieval times. Costumes in films are used to enhance a reality of the narration not to define it. Simple outfits that are worn in film also tells some type of story or secret (Laverty, Lord Christopher 2011). Designers doesn't always enhance their characters by new fabric,costumes are rented from existing materials to fit characters in movies or plays. The use of colors and patterns in costumes are bold representations. Before a movie or play is produced, designers read scripts to identify the era in which the piece is taken place, this helps to get started on their first sketch.They create costume charts that label what characters are wearing in specific scenes. Their final sketch is presented after the first has been approved. The final sketch shows more vivid and unique features with the use of colors. All of this information sounds very similar to a fashion designer. Some people are unable to identify the difference between costume and fashion designers. Costume designing is made for characters in stories while fashion is for a person's style. Costume designs have limited time and assignments on creativity. There are more expenses used in costume designing and there is the need for research and knowledge of culture or history (UKEssay 2018).

{{Literature}}
The '''dime novel''' is a form of late 19th-century and early 20th-century U.S. popular fiction issued in series of inexpensive paperbound editions. The term ''dime novel'' has been used as a catchall term for several different but related forms, referring to [[story paper]]s, five- and ten-cent weeklies, "thick book" reprints, and sometimes early [[pulp magazine]]s.&lt;ref group=notes&gt;The English equivalents were generally called [[penny dreadful]]s or shilling shockers. The German and French equivalents were called "Groschenromane" and "livraisons à dix centimes", respectively. American firms also issued foreign editions of many of their works, especially as series characters came into vogue.&lt;/ref&gt; The term was used as a title as late as 1940, in the short-lived pulp magazine ''Western Dime Novels''. In the modern age, the term ''dime novel'' has been used to refer to quickly written, lurid [[potboiler]]s, usually as a [[pejorative]] to describe a sensationalized but superficial literary work.

== History ==
[[File:Malaeska.jpg|thumb|Cover of ''Malaeska, the Indian Wife of the White Hunter'' (1860)]]
In 1860, the publishers Erastus and Irwin Beadle released a new series of cheap paperbacks, ''Beadle's Dime Novels''.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Lyons|Lyons (2011)]], p. 156.&lt;/ref&gt; ''Dime novel'' became a general term for similar paperbacks produced by various publishers in the early twentieth century. The first book in the Beadle series was ''Malaeska, the Indian Wife of the White Hunter'', by [[Ann S. Stephens]], dated June 9, 1860.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Lyons|Lyons (2011)]], p. 156.&lt;/ref&gt; The novel was essentially a reprint of Stephens's earlier serial, which had appeared in the ''Ladies' Companion'' magazine in February, March and April 1839. It sold more than 65,000 copies in the first few months after its publication as a dime novel.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Lyons|Lyons (2011)]], pp. 156–157.&lt;/ref&gt; Dime novels varied in size, even in the first Beadle series, but were mostly about {{convert|6.5|by|4.25|in|cm}}, with 100 pages. The first 28 were published without a cover illustration, in a salmon-colored paper wrapper. A woodblock print was added in issue 29, and the first 28 were reprinted with illustrated covers. The books were priced, of course, at ten cents.

This series ran for 321 issues and established almost all the conventions of the genre, from the lurid and outlandish story to the melodramatic double titling used throughout the series, which ended in the 1920s. Most of the stories were frontier tales reprinted from the numerous serials in the story papers and other sources,&lt;ref group=notes&gt;Lax copyright enforcement allowed the publication of many foreign literary works without payment of royalties.&lt;/ref&gt; but many were original stories.

As the popularity of dime novels increased, original stories came to be the norm. The books were reprinted many times, sometimes with different covers, and the stories were often further reprinted in different series and by different publishers.&lt;ref group=notes&gt;The proliferation of reprints has been a source of confusion about first printings. As a general rule, the date of the printing can be determined from the other titles in the series listed on the back cover. Dime novels were issued in twos or sometimes fours, so a first printing does not list more than three numbers beyond the number on the cover, whereas a later printing may list a hundred titles beyond the cover number. The books are so rare now that the lateness of the printing does not much affect their price.&lt;/ref&gt;

The literacy rate increased around the time of the [[American Civil War]], and ''Beadle's Dime Novels'' were immediately popular among young, working-class readers. By the end of the war, numerous competitors, such as George Munro and Robert DeWitt, were crowding the field, distinguishing their product only by title and the color of the paper wrappers. Beadle &amp; Adams had their own alternate "brands", such as the Frank Starr line. As a whole, the quality of the fiction was derided by highbrow critics, and the term ''dime novel'' came to refer to any form of cheap, sensational fiction, rather than the specific format.

Nonetheless, the pocket-sized sea, Western, railway, circus, gold-digger, and other adventures were an instant success. Author Armin Jaemmrich observes that [[Alexis de Tocqueville]]'s theses in [[Democracy in America]] (1835) says that in democratic and socially permeable societies, like that of the U.S., the lower classes were not "naturally indifferent to science, literature, and the arts: only it must be acknowledged that they cultivate them after their own fashion, and bring to the task their own peculiar qualifications and deficiencies." He found that in aristocratic societies education and interest in literature were confined to a small upper class, and that the literary class would arrive at a "sort of aristocratic jargon, ... hardly less remote from pure language than was the coarse dialect of the people."&lt;ref&gt;[[#Jaemmrich|Jaemmrich (2016)]], Chapter XIII.&lt;/ref&gt; According to Tocqueville, due to the heterogeneity of its population, the situation in the U.S. was different, and people were asking for reading matter. Since, in his view, practically every American was busy earning a living with no time for obtaining a higher education let alone for timeconsuming distractions, they preferred books which "may be easily procured, quickly read, and which require no learned researches to be understood ... they require rapid emotions, startling passages .... Small productions will be more common than bulky books ... The object of authors will be to astonish rather than to please, and to stir the passions more than to charm the taste." Written twenty-five years prior to the emergence of the dimes, his words read like an exact anticipation of their main characteristics.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Jaemmrich|Jaemmrich (2016)]]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Prices ===

Adding to the general confusion as to what is or is not a dime novel, many of the series, though similar in design and subject, cost ten to fifteen cents. Beadle &amp; Adams complicated the matter by issuing some titles in the same salmon-colored covers at different prices. Also, there were a number of ten-cent, paper-covered books of the period that featured medieval romance stories and melodramatic tales. This makes it hard to define what falls in the category of the dime novel, with classification depending on format, price, or style of material. Examples of dime novel series that illustrate the diversity of the form include ''Bunce's Ten Cent Novels'', ''Brady's Mercury Stories'', ''Beadle's Dime Novels'', Irwin P. Beadle's ''Ten Cent Stories'', ''Munro's Ten Cent Novels'', ''Dawley's Ten Penny Novels'', ''Fireside Series'', ''Chaney's Union Novels'','' DeWitt's Ten Cent Romances'', ''Champion Novels'', ''Frank Starr's American Novels'', ''Ten Cent Novelettes'', ''Richmond's Sensation Novels'', and ''Ten Cent Irish Novels''.
[[Image:NewDime.jpg|thumb|right|The ''New Dime Novel Series'' introduced color covers but reprinted stories from the original series]]
In 1874, Beadle &amp; Adams added the novelty of color to the covers when their ''New Dime Novels'' series replaced the flagship title. The ''New Dime Novels'' were issued with a dual numbering system on the cover, one continuing the numbering from the first series and the second and more prominent one indicating the number in the current series; for example, the first issue was numbered 1 (322). The stories were mostly reprints from the first series. Like its predecessor, Beadle's ''New Dime Novels'' ran for 321 issues, until 1885.

=== Development ===

Much of the content of dime novels came from [[story paper]]s, which were weekly, eight-page newspaper-like publications, varying in size from tabloid to full-size newspaper format and usually costing five or six cents. They started in the mid-1850s and were immensely popular, some titles being issued for over fifty years on a weekly schedule. They are perhaps best described as the television of their day, containing a variety of serial stories and articles, with something aimed at each member of the family, and often illustrated profusely with woodcuts. Popular story papers included ''The Saturday Journal'', ''Young Men of America'', ''Golden Weekly'', ''Golden Hours'', ''Good News'', and ''Happy Days''.&lt;ref group=notes&gt;There were English story papers as well, containing much the same sort of content. The stories were similarly reprinted in various other formats.&lt;/ref&gt;

Most of the stories in dime novels stood alone, but in the late 1880s series characters began to appear and quickly grew in popularity. The original [[Frank Reade]] stories first appeared in ''Boys of New York''. The Old Sleuth, appearing in ''The Fireside Companion'' story paper beginning in 1872, was the first dime-novel detective and began the trend away from the western and frontier stories that dominated the story papers and dime novels up to that time. He was the first character to use the word ''sleuth'' to denote a detective, the word's original definition being that of a bloodhound trained to track. He is also responsible for the popularity of the use of the word ''old'' in the names of competing dime novel detectives, such as Old Cap Collier, Old Broadbrim, Old King Brady, Old Lightning, and Old Ferret, among many others. [[Nick Carter (literary character)|Nick Carter]] first appeared in 1886 in the ''[[New York Weekly]]''. Frank Reade, the Old Sleuth and Nick Carter had their own ten-cent weekly titles within a few years.&lt;ref group=notes&gt;Nick Carter has proved to be one of the most durable, if bland, fictional characters of all time. In one incarnation or another, he has been active for over 100 years, most recently as Nick Carter, Killmaster, in a long-running paperback series.&lt;/ref&gt;[[Image:Old Sleuth 40 pt 1.jpg|thumb|right|250px|''Old Sleuth Library'', 1888]]
[[Image:New York Detective Library 77.jpg|thumb|left|Frank Tousey's major black-and-white library, 1884]]

=== Changing formats ===

In 1873, the house of Beadle &amp; Adams introduced a new ten-cent format, {{convert|9|x|13.25|in|mm}}, with only 32 pages and a black-and-white illustration on the cover, under the title ''New and Old Friends''. It was not a success, but the format was so much cheaper to produce that they tried again in 1877 with ''The Fireside Library'' and ''Frank Starr's New York Library''. The first reprinted English love stories, the second contained hardier material, but both titles caught on. Publishers were no less eager to follow a new trend then than now. Soon the newsstands were flooded by ten-cent weekly "libraries". These publications also varied in size, from as small as 7 x 10&amp;nbsp;inches (''The Boy's Star Library'' is an example) to 8.5 x 12 (''New York Detective Library''). The ''Old Cap Collier Library'' was issued in both sizes and also in booklet form. Each issue tended to feature a single story, unlike the story papers, and many of them were devoted to a single character. Frontier stories, evolving into westerns, were still popular, but the new vogue tended to urban crime stories. One of the most successful titles, [[Frank Tousey]]'s ''New York Detective Library'' eventually came to alternate stories of the James Gang with stories of Old King Brady, detective, and (in a rare occurrence in the dime novel) several stories which featured both, with Old King Brady doggedly on the trail of the vicious gang.&lt;ref group=notes&gt;Nick Carter was also a character in stories featuring other detectives, such as Old Broadbrim, much as superheroes crossover in today's comic books.&lt;/ref&gt;

The competition was fierce, and publishers were always looking for an edge. Once again, color came into play when Frank Tousey introduced a weekly with brightly colored covers in 1896. Street &amp; Smith countered by issuing a weekly in a smaller format with muted colors. Such titles as ''New Nick Carter Weekly'' (continuing the original black-and-white ''Nick Carter Library''), ''Tip-Top Weekly'' (introducing [[Frank Merriwell]]) and others were 7 x 10 inches with thirty-two pages of text, but the 8.5 x 11 Tousey format carried the day, and Street &amp; Smith soon followed suit. The price was also dropped to five cents, making the magazines more accessible to children. This would be the last major permutation of the product before it evolved into pulp magazines. Ironically, for many years it has been the nickel weeklies that most people refer to when using the term ''dime novel''. [[Image:Secret Service COLOR.jpg|thumb|right| One of the most popular color-covered nickel weeklies, ''Secret Service'', no. 225, May 15, 1903]]
The nickel weeklies were popular, and their numbers grew quickly. Frank Tousey and Street &amp; Smith dominated the field. Tousey had his "big six": ''Work and Win'' (featuring Fred Fearnot, a serious rival to the soon-to-be-popular Frank Merriwell), ''Secret Service'', ''Pluck and Luck'', ''Wild West Weekly'', ''[[Fame and Fortune Weekly]]'', and ''The Liberty Boys of '76'', each of which issued over a thousand copies weekly.&lt;ref group=notes&gt;Several shorter runs are among the most collectible today: ''Frank Reade Weekly'' (the color-cover followup to the ''Frank Reade Library'') and ''The James Boys''.&lt;/ref&gt; Street &amp; Smith had ''New Nick Carter Weekly'', ''Tip Top Weekly'', ''Buffalo Bill Stories'', ''Jesse James Stories'', ''Brave &amp; Bold Weekly'' and many others. The Tousey stories were generally the more lurid and sensational of the two.

Perhaps the most confusing of the various formats lumped together under the term ''dime novel'' are the so-called "thick-book" series, most of which were published by Street &amp; Smith, J. S. Ogilvie and Arthur Westbrook. These books were published in series, contained roughly 150 to 200 pages, and were {{convert|4.75|x|7|in|mm}}, often with color covers on a higher-grade stock. They reprinted multiple stories from the five- and ten-cent weeklies, often slightly rewritten to tie them together.

[[Image:AmDetSeries no. 21.jpg|thumb|left|An example of a "thick book" series, ''American Detective Series'', no. 21, Arthur Westbrook Co.]]

All dime-novel publishers were canny about reusing and refashioning material, but Street &amp; Smith excelled at it. They developed the practice of publishing four consecutive, related tales of, for example, Nick Carter, in the weekly magazine, then combining the four stories into one edition of the related thick-book series, in this instance, the ''New Magnet Library''.&lt;ref group=notes&gt;In addition, Street &amp; Smith bought the rights to other detective stories and had them strung together and rewritten into Nick Carter stories, allowing the ''New Magnet Library'' to run for over 1000 issues.&lt;/ref&gt; The Frank Merriwell stories appeared in the ''Medal, New Medal'' and ''Merriwell'' libraries, Buffalo Bill in the ''Buffalo Bill Library'' and ''Far West Library'', and so on. The thick books were still in print as late as the 1930s but carry the copyright date of the original story, often as early as the late nineteenth century, leading some dealers and new collectors today to erroneously assume they have original dime novels when the books are only distantly related.

=== Demise ===

In 1896, Frank Munsey had converted his juvenile magazine ''The Argosy'' into a fiction magazine for adults, the first of the pulp magazines. By the turn of the century, new high-speed printing techniques combined with cheaper pulp paper allowed him to drop the price from twenty-five cents to ten cents, and sales of the magazine took off.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Lyons|Lyons (2011)]], p. 156.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1910 Street and Smith converted two of their nickel weeklies, ''New Tip Top Weekly'' and ''Top Notch Magazine'', into pulps; in 1915, ''Nick Carter Stories'', itself a replacement for the ''New Nick Carter Weekly'', became ''Detective Story Magazine'', and in 1919, ''New Buffalo Bill Weekly'' became ''[[Western Story Magazine]]''. Harry Wolff, the successor in interest to the Frank Tousey titles, continued to reprint many of them into the mid-1920s, most notably ''Secret Service, Pluck and Luck, Fame and Fortune'' and ''Wild West Weekly''. These two series were purchased by Street &amp; Smith in 1926 and converted into pulp magazines the following year, effectively ending the era of the dime novel.

In the late 1940s and early 1950s, collecting dime novels became popular, and prices soared. Even at that time the cheap publications were crumbling into dust and becoming hard to find.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3747">'''Folk poetry''' (sometimes referred to as ''poetry in action'') is poetry that is part of a society's [[folklore]], usually part of their [[oral tradition]]. When sung, folk poetry becomes a [[folk song]].

==Description==
Folk poetry in general has several characteristics. It may be informal and unofficial, generally lacks an owner and may "belong" to the society, and its telling may be an implicitly social activity.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation| url = https://www.folklore.ee/folklore/vol33/gwyndaf.pdf | title = Poetry in Action: Verse and Narration in Everyday Communication| first = Robin| last = Gwyndaf | doi = 10.7592/FEJF2006.33.gwyndaf | volume = 33 | journal = folklore | year = 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The term can refer to poems of an [[oral tradition]] that may date back many years;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation| url = | page = 170 | title = Folk Poetry | work = CCP Encyclopedia of Philippine Art: Philippine literature | year  =1994 }}&lt;/ref&gt; that is, it is information that has been transmitted over time (between generations) ''only'' in spoken (and non-written) form.{{sfn|Dorson|1982|p=85}} Thus as an oral tradition folk poetry requires a performer to promulgate it over generations.{{sfn|Dorson|1982|p=86}}

The definition can also be extended to include not just oral epics, but [[latrinalia]], many forms of [[childlore]] ([[skipping-rope rhyme]]s, the words of [[counting-out game]]s etc), and [[limericks]];&lt;ref&gt;{{citation| title = Chicano Folklore: A Handbook| first = María | last = Herrera-Sobek | pages = 23-4 | year =2006}} ; definition from Dundes "What is Folkore?", (1965)&lt;/ref&gt; as well as including anonymous or improvised poems.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation| first = Harold| last =Bloom| year = 1989 |title = The Art of the Critic: Early twentieth century | page = 111- }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Narrative folk poetry is often characterized by repetition, a focus on a single event (within an overall epic narrative if present), and an impersonal narration, as well as use of exaggeration and contrast.{{sfn|Dorson|1982|pp=87-90}}

It is thought that epics such as ''[[The Iliad]]'', and ''[[The Odyssey]]'' derive from, or are modeled on earlier folk-poetry forms.{{sfn|Dorson|1982|p=90}}

In the [[Hollywood]] [[movie industry]], a '''four-quadrant movie''' is one which appeals to all four major demographic "quadrants" of the moviegoing audience: both male and female, and both over- and under-25s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-15386597|title=Why did The Help clean up at the US box office?|author=Neil Smith|publisher=BBC News|date=26 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Films are generally aimed at at least two such quadrants, and most [[Tent-pole (entertainment)|tent-pole films]] are four-quadrant movies. A film's budget is often correlated to the number of quadrants the film is expected to reach, and movies are rarely produced if not focused on at least two quadrants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Friend|first1=Tad|title=The Cobra|url=http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2009/01/19/the-cobra?currentPage=all|publisher=[[The New Yorker]]|date=19 January 2009|accessdate=7 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although four-quadrant movies are generally [[family-friendly]], this is not a requirement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Tomasi|first1=Rollo|title=Film Term of the Week: Four-quadrant Movie|url=http://film-book.com/film-term-of-the-week-four-quadrant-movie/|website=Filmbook|accessdate=7 December 2014|date=30 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some other genres meeting this may be romantic (such as ''[[Titanic (1997 film)|Titanic]]'' and ''[[Meet the Parents]]'') or horror films (''[[The Exorcist (film)|The Exorcist]]''), or be crowd-pleasing in nature,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=White|first1=Forest F.|title=How to write a four-quadrant story, or using movie marketing logic on a novel|url=http://ffwhite.dreamwidth.org/9438.html|website=Dreamwidth|accessdate=7 December 2014|date=27 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=10 Great Quadrant Movies Screenwriters Can Learn From|url=http://screenplayscripts.com/10-great-quadrant-movies/|website=Industrial Scripts|accessdate=7 December 2014|date=28 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; such as high-profile action films or adaptations of popular novels.

'''''Frank Zappa Meets the Mothers of Prevention''''' is a 1985 album by [[Frank Zappa]]. The album was originally released in two slightly different versions in the US and Europe.

The album's title is a reference to  the lobby group, the [[Parents Music Resource Center|PMRC]], who were campaigning to require record companies to put [[Parental Advisory|warning stickers]] on albums they considered offensive, and to Zappa's former band, [[the Mothers of Invention]].

== Release ==
Following distribution problems with Zappa's album ''[[Thing-Fish]]'', which former [[Barking Pumpkin Records|Barking Pumpkin]] distributor [[MCA Records]] refused to distribute,&lt;ref name=Zappa&gt;{{cite book| title = The Real Frank Zappa Book| first = Frank with Occhiogrosso, Peter| last = Zappa| year = 1989| publisher=Poseidon Press| location = New York| isbn = 0-671-63870-X |pages=278–279}}&lt;/ref&gt; Zappa made a deal with [[EMI Records]], which would allow ''[[Them or Us]]'' and ''Thing-Fish'' to be distributed by [[Capitol Records]] in the United States.&lt;ref name=Zappa/&gt; Zappa wrote a "[[Warning label|warning]]" which appeared on the inner sleeves of these albums, as well as ''Frank Zappa Meets the Mothers of Prevention'', which stated that the albums contained content "which a truly free society would neither fear nor suppress", and a "guarantee" which stated that the lyrics would not "cause eternal torment in [[Hell|the place]] where [[The Devil|the guy with the horns and pointed stick]] conducts his business."&lt;ref name=Zappa/&gt; The liner notes also contained a quote from Senator [[Ernest Hollings]], who testified during the PMRC hearings: "…if I could find some way constitutionally to do away with it [foul language in music], I would", as well as Zappa's oft-repeated liner notes request for his fans to register to vote.

The original US version of the album contains the track "Porn Wars" – a sound collage featuring excerpts from PMRC hearings. This track was omitted from non-US versions, and replaced with three other pieces: "I Don't Even Care", co-written by Zappa and [[Johnny "Guitar" Watson]], and two instrumental tracks – "One Man, One Vote" (a Synclavier composition) and "H.R. 2911", which collates some of the backing music from "Porn Wars", without the PMRC hearing excerpts and other dialogue. The initial EMI CDs only included the European Version. The original Rykodisc CDs addes two of the three European tracks and shuffled around the running order. The 1995 Rykodisc remaster added the third European track after the same shuffled order.

The '''Gänseliesel''' (English: Goose Girl, Goose Lizzy ('''Liesel''' as pet name of Elisabeth)) is a fountain which was erected in 1901 in front of the mediaeval town hall of [[Göttingen]], [[Germany]]. Although rather small in size, the fountain is the most well-known landmark of the city. Today, it is an essential part of graduation celebrations, for every student who finishes a [[doctorate]] at the [[Georg-August University of Göttingen|George August University Göttingen]] has to climb the fountain and kiss the statue of the goose girl.&lt;ref&gt;{{de icon}} [http://www.gateway-to-germany.de/german/print/4.21.3.11.html Stadtporträt Göttingen] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20120910201654/http://www.gateway-to-germany.de/german/print/4.21.3.11.html |date=2012-09-10 }}. Retrieved 2007-01-28.&lt;/ref&gt;

A Gänseliesel is also situated in [[Monheim am Rhein]], [[Hanover]]'s Steintor Square and [[Berlin]]'s Nikolsburger Square.

== History ==

Since the 18th century, a fountain was located on the site of the Gänseliesel. However, the old fountain was partially pulled down in the early 19th century due to deterioration. In 1898, the city council decided to construct a new fountain, for which sculptors from all over Germany presented their proposals. From all designs, the [[Gothic Revival architecture|neo-gothical]] proposal "Im Geiste der Alten/Tugendbrunnen" ("In the Spirit of the Ancients/Fountain of Virtue") by the sculptors Mehs and Jehs was favoured while the goose girl design by the architect Heinrich Stöckhardt was only ranked second place. However, after the official ranking the three best designs were put on exhibition. The citizens of Göttingen widely preferred the simpler design of the goose girl, probably because the simple girl image best represents the common people - in contrast to the numerous statues of famous university scientists found in the city. After long discussion, the Gänseliesel, then designed by the architect [[Friedrich Heinrich Stöckhardt|Heinrich Stöckhardt]] and created by the sculptor Paul Nisse, was finally put up in 1901 without any official ceremony. The Gänseliesel fountain does not have any particular connection to the history of the town. The Original of the sculpture is today in the Town Museum (''Städtisches Museum'')

==Traditions==

Soon after the fountain was erected, newly enrolled students of the [[Georg-August University of Göttingen|Georgia Augusta university]] began to climb up the fountain and to kiss the statue which rapidly became a university tradition. Because the climbing of the fountain was usually celebrated with excessive consumption of alcohol and loud cheers of fellow students and because the number of students largely increased after [[World War I]], police issued a decree in 1926 that officially forbade the climbing and kissing of the statue. A law student who was prosecuted for kissing the goose girl in the same year, took the case to court. However, the superior court of justice in [[Berlin]] legitimated the edict.

The tradition itself has changed over time, and today it is unusual for first year students to kiss the statue; it is now more common to bring a bouquet of flowers to the Gänseliesel and to give her a kiss after one's official reception of the [[doctorate]] degree. It is for this reason that the fountain is decorated with flowers very frequently, and throughout the year. Until recently, climbing and kissing of the monument remained officially forbidden although both the city of Göttingen and the university advertise themselves with pictures of PhD graduates kissing the girl.

As the fountain has been subject to vandalism, the original statue of the goose girl can today be seen in the Stadtmuseum while the fountain only carries a copy. After a severe assault during the winter of 2004 (malicious arson), the fountain needed to be disassembled and underwent major restoration.

Since 1995, each year on a weekend in September the city of Göttingen stages the so-called "Gänselieselfest" in honor of the goose girl. Main event of these festivities is the election of a young woman from Göttingen as the Gänseliesel, representing the town and the statue for one year.

'''''Hiawatha''''' and '''''Minnehaha''''' are 1868 sculptures by [[Edmonia Lewis]]. They are in the collection of the [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]] on view in gallery 759.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.metmuseum.org/art/collection/search/687670|title=Edmonia Lewis {{!}} Hiawatha {{!}} The Met|website=The Metropolitan Museum of Art, i.e. The Met Museum|access-date=2017-05-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.metmuseum.org/art/collection/search/687677|title=Edmonia Lewis {{!}} Minnehaha {{!}} The Met|website=The Metropolitan Museum of Art, i.e. The Met Museum|access-date=2017-05-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;
==Early history and creation==
[[African Americans|African-American]], [[Haitian diaspora|Haitian]] and [[Ojibwe|Chippewa]] (Ojibwa) artist, Lewis, developed her [[Neoclassicism|neoclassical]] style of marble sculpture while working in [[Rome]]. Lewis was an admirer of [[Henry Wadsworth Longfellow]]'s poetry, and in 1869 Longfellow visited her studio where he posed for one of her portraits which was shortly afterward acquired by Harvard University.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://antiquesandfineart.com/articles/article.cfm?request=191|title=Hiawatha in Rome: Edmonia Lewis and Figures from Longfellow by user from Antiques &amp; Fine Art magazine|website=antiquesandfineart.com|access-date=2017-05-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Description and interpretation==
[[File:Hiawatha MET DP371840.jpg|thumb|left|Hiawatha]]
Often working in themes that intersected her identity, Lewis focused a series of marble sculptures based on Longfellow’s much-referenced and best-selling poem “[[The Song of Hiawatha]]” (1855) about the Ojibwa warrior, [[Hiawatha]]'s tragic story with his lover from a rival tribe, [[Minnehaha]] (Dakota).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-LhwwTdCkiYC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=song+of+hiawatha&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjxtq-PwoHUAhWBSCYKHYGVB8sQ6AEIIzAA#v=onepage&amp;q=song%20of%20hiawatha&amp;f=false|title=The Song of Hiawatha|last=Longfellow|first=Henry Wadsworth|date=1857|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are three busts of Hiawatha in existence and four of the Minnehaha busts. 

In addition to paying tribute to her heritage, Lewis also took agency by utilizing concepts of the [[Noble savage|Noble Savage]] in these works, idealizing and fantasizing the form and dress of the two fictional characters. Unlike other images of this theme and time, Lewis subversively focused not on their naked flesh, which historically attracted male collectors, but on decorating their bodies in clothing, which was intended to appeal to the women viewers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=SByfh6JC7JkC&amp;pg=RA2-PA5&amp;lpg=RA2-PA5&amp;dq=hiawatha+edmonia+lewis&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=t2OyBOPZX8&amp;sig=0sFPHKd6DFWRVMK03f34NsPGPsk&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiK1tLU4IHUAhVBC8AKHbUlC6E4FBDoAQgiMAA#v=onepage&amp;q=hiawatha%20edmonia%20lewis&amp;f=false|title=The Indomitable Spirit of Edmonia Lewis: A Narrative Biography|last=Henderson|first=Harry Brinton|last2=Henderson|first2=Albert|date=2012|publisher=Untreed Reads|isbn=9781588634528|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; The works became popular for collectors not only because of her high skill level, but also with the help of Lewis' tales, exaggerating her connection to her [[Native Americans in the United States|First Nations]] ancestry, having actually grown up in [[Newark, New Jersey|Newark]], NJ, thus capitalizing on the popular culture's fascination with the "[[Noble savage|romantic primitive]]."&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  

==Later history and influence==
The pair of sculptures was acquired by the [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]] in 2015.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.christies.com/lotfinder/Lot/edmonia-lewis-1845-after-1911-minnehaha-5880413-details.aspx|title=Edmonia Lewis (1845-after 1911)  , Minnehaha|website=www.christies.com|language=en|access-date=2017-05-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2000 the [[Newark Museum]] acquired a separate pair&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://gallery.newarkmuseum.org/view/objects/asitem/Objects@3244844|title=Hiawatha|last=|first=|date=|website=Newark Museum - Collection|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-04-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://gallery.newarkmuseum.org/view/objects/asitem/Objects@3244834|title=Hiawatha|last=|first=|date=|website=Newark Museum - Collection|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-04-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; through Christie's Auction House for above their estimated bid prices of $60000 each.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; 

Aside from this pair of small busts, Lewis'&amp;nbsp;series includes ''Wooing of Hiawatha'' (or ''The Old Arrowmaker and His Daughter''),1866-1872, which one of six is in The Walter O. Evans Collection at the [[SCAD Museum of Art]], and ''The Marriage of Hiawatha and Minnehaha'' (or ''Hiawatha's Marriage'')'',''&amp;nbsp;1866–1868, rediscovered in 1991, which one of two is in the collection of [[Montgomery Museum of Fine Arts]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://artsandactivities.com/hiawathas-marriage-edmonia-lewis/|title=Hiawatha’s Marriage, Edmonia Lewis {{!}} Arts &amp; Activities|website=artsandactivities.com|language=en-US|access-date=2017-05-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://americanart.si.edu/collections/search/artist/?id=2914|title=Edmonia Lewis {{!}} Smithsonian American Art Museum|website=americanart.si.edu|language=en|access-date=2017-05-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Kasbah of Béja''' is a historical citadel in the [[Tunisia]]n city [[Béja]], the [[Kasbah]] was built in the 2nd century BC and still exists till today which makes it one of oldest citadels in the region.

== Location ==

The Kasbah was built on the top of a hill of 305 meters in northern Béja, and this site was chosen so the castle can overlook the city and its surrounding plains and countryside.

== History ==

=== The Kasbah during the antique and middle ages ===

The first citadel of Béja was built in 2nd century BC by the [[Carthaginians]], at that time Béja was called [[Vaga (Tunisia)|Vaga]] and was an important agriculture town so Carthage needed to protect specially from barbarian raids, but after the decline of the Carthaginian power, specially after the [[third Punic war]], the city fell under the influence of the [[Numidians]] and their king [[Jugurtha]] made the fortress his center of reign. 
&lt;br /&gt;In 109 BC the [[Romans]] took power over the castle and then destroyed it. In 14 BC the Romans rebuilt the fort and improved it adding a garrison, walls and 22 towers.
&lt;br /&gt;The fort was once again razed to the ground this time by [[Vandals]] during the vandal invasion of North Africa, and the building only raised again by the [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantines]] after their liberation of the city from the Vandal rule, where the [[Byzantine emperors|Byzantine emperor]] [[Justinian I]] ordered in 533 Count Paulos to reconstruct the castle.  
&lt;br /&gt;The expansion of the fort continued after the [[Muslim conquest of the Maghreb]] where the new Muslim rulers of the country gave it the name "Kasbah" and made it the official center of their representatives of the northern-region, the expansion continued during the rule of the [[Aghlabids]] but in 943 the Kasbah suffered major damage when Béja was sacked by the [[Kharijite]] rebels led by [[Abu Yazid]] and in 945 the kasbah was restored by the [[Fatimide]] Caliph [[Al-Mansur Billah]].

=== The Kasbah during the modern era ===

[[File:Prise de Béja - 20-5-1881.jpg|thumb|right|Th fall of the Kasbah to the French troops]]
In the 16th century, during the reign of [[Ahmad III (Hafsid)|Ahmed III]], the Kasbah was fortified by adding 14 canons to the fort.  
&lt;br /&gt;The Ottomans too gave their part in the expansion of the citadel by establishing a [[flanking tower]] that protected the southern parts of the Kasbah and a garrison of the [[Janissary]], and in 1677 the Tunisian monarch [[Ali I Bey]] supported the garrison by a [[battalion]] of 500 knights from [[Spahis]].
&lt;br /&gt;After the [[French occupation of Tunisia]] in 1881, the Kasbah become a [[Gendarmerie]] barrack, and that from September 21, 1888 till the independence of the country in 1957.

== Current use ==

After the independence of Tunisia from France, the fortress was turned into a cultural center, but today the Kasbah is in bad conditions. Restorations started in 2005 and directed by the Tunisian [[National Heritage Institute (Tunisia)|National Heritage Institute]], but it has stopped for lack of funding.

==Entertainment career==
In 1976, Atchity founded L/A House, Inc., a consulting, translation, book, television, and film development and production company whose clients included the [[Getty Museum]] and the [[US Postal Service]]. L/A House began by extending Atchity's teaching of creative writing to manuscript consultation and soon moved on to publishing with the production of ''Follies'', a magazine covering creativity, and ''CQ:'' ''Contemporary Quarterly; Poetry and Art'' of which he was editor. In the 1980s L/A House moved into television, with a syndicated television pilot of ''BreakThrough!'' of which Atchity was executive producer and co-writer.

In 1985, L/A House began development of a set of video/TV romance film projects entitled ''[[Shades of Love (film series)|Shades of Love]]'', which became 16 full-length films, produced in 1986–87 with Atchity as executive producer, that aired throughout the world, distributed by [[Lorimar]], Astral-Bellevue-Pathe, Manson International, and [[Warner Brothers|Warner Brothers International]], nominated for Canada's [[Gemini Award]]; in the U.S. they premiered on Cinemax-HBO.

In 1989 he sold L/A House and founded AEI (Atchity Editorial/Entertainment International),&lt;ref name="aeionline1" /&gt; a literary management and motion picture production company. Chi-Li Wong,&lt;ref&gt;Chi-Li Wong IMDB [https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0938995/]&lt;/ref&gt; formerly Associate Director of the Ft. Lauderdale Film Festival, joined him as AEI partner in 1992. AEI was incorporated in 1996, its name changed to Atchity Entertainment International, Inc. in 2005.

In 1996 Atchity also founded [http://www.thewriterslifeline.com/ The Writers Lifeline, Inc.]&lt;ref name="thewriterslifeline1"/&gt; (incorporated in 2002) to continue the consulting work of L/A House and to prepare intellectual property for representation: "bringing your craft and skills to the level of your vision and ambition."

In 2006, he and manager-partner Fred Griffin of Houston's Griffin Partners,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite ]web|url=http://www.griffinpartners.com |title=griffinpartners.com |publisher=griffinpartners.com |date= |accessdate=April 20, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; along with a group of investors from Louisiana and Texas, acquired [http://www.thelouisianawavestudio.com/index.html The Louisiana Wave Studio],&lt;ref name="thelouisianawavestudio1"/&gt; LLC in Shreveport, Louisiana from [[Walt Disney Productions]]. The LWS is the only tank specifically designed to make waves for motion pictures in North America. Films produced at the LWS include ''[[The Guardian (2006 film)|The Guardian]]'', ''Mayday—Bering Sea'', [[Shark Night 3d|''Shark Night 3D'',]] [[Streets of Blood|''Streets of Blood'',]] and [[I Love You Phillip Morris|''I Love You, Philip Morris'';]] along with numerous government and industrial films.

Responding to changes in the worlds of entertainment and publishing, in 2009 AEI shifted its energies to raising independent financing for motion pictures to advance its clients' interests. In 2011 Atchity and Wong were nominated for an [[Emmy Award|Emmy]] for producing ''The Kennedy Detail'' ([[Discovery Channel|Discovery]])&lt;ref&gt;[http://dsc.discovery.com/search/results.html?focus=site&amp;query=The+Kennedy+Detail&amp;search=+]{{dead link|date=April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; based on their clients' Jerry Blaine and Lisa McCubbin's ''[[New York Times]]'' bestselling book by the same title published by Gallery/[[Simon &amp; Schuster]] in 2010. AEI's films include ''[[Joe Somebody]]'' ([[Tim Allen]], [[Julie Bowen]]), ''[[Life or Something Like It|Life Or Something Like It]]'' ([[Angelina Jolie]], [[Edward Burns]]), and ''[[The Meg|The MEG]]'' ([[Jason Statham]]).
[[File:The Messiah Matrix.jpg|thumb|A Thriller by Kenneth John Atchity]]
In 2010, Atchity also founded Atchity Productions for independent film productions, and Story Merchant&lt;ref name="storymerchant1"/&gt; for representation and strategic coaching for writers.

== ''The Messiah Matrix'' ==
In 2012, Atchity published his completion of [[William Diehl|William Diehl's]] ''Seven Ways to Die'' and his first solo novel, ''The Messiah Matrix''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://newtopiamagazine.wordpress.com/2012/11/15/mongrel-patriot-review-producer-and-writer-kenneth-atchity/|title=Mongrel Patriot Review: Producer and Writer Kenneth Atchity|last=Nichols|first=Kimberly|date=Nov 15, 2012|website=Newtopia Magazine|publisher=|access-date=March 28, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The novel centers on a fictional marine archaeological find of a rare Herodian coin honoring Augustus. A romantic interest develops between the American archaeologist who has discovered the coin, and a young Jesuit priest intrigued by its implications.  A powerful faction of the Jesuits has been preparing to announce that the fictional character [[Jesus of Nazareth]] was inspired by the life of Caesar [[Augustus]], and the coin is crucial evidence for their claims.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Regarding the premise of his novel, Atchity said that it is based on actual historical facts linking Jesus and Augustus.

{{Intellectual property}}
'''Limitations and exceptions to copyright''' are provisions, in local [[copyright law]] or [[Berne Convention]], which allow for copyrighted works to be used without a license from the copyright owner.

Limitations and exceptions to copyright relate to a number of important considerations such as [[market failure]], [[freedom of speech]],&lt;ref&gt;P. Bernt Hugenholtz. ''Copyright And Freedom Of Expression In Europe'' (2001) Published in: [[Rochelle C. Dreyfuss|Rochelle Cooper Dreyfuss]], Harry First and Diane Leenheer Zimmerman (eds.), ''Expanding the Boundaries of Intellectual Property'',  Oxford University Press&lt;/ref&gt; education and equality of access (such as by the visually impaired). Some view limitations and exceptions as "user rights"—seeing user rights as providing an essential balance to the rights of the copyright owners. There is no consensus among copyright experts as to whether user rights are rights or simply limitations on copyright. See for example the National Research Council's [http://books.nap.edu/html/digital_dilemma/exec_summ.html#REF1 Digital Agenda Report, note 1]. The concept of user rights has also been recognised by courts, including the [[Canadian Supreme Court]] in [http://scc-csc.lexum.com/scc-csc/scc-csc/en/item/2125/index.do CCH Canadian Ltd v. Law Society of Upper Canada] (2004 SCC 13), which classed "fair dealing" as such a user right. These kinds of disagreements in philosophy are quite common in the [[philosophy of copyright]], where debates about jurisprudential reasoning tend to act as proxies for more substantial disagreements about good policy.

==Changing technology==

The scope of copyright limitations and exceptions became a subject of societal and political debate within various nations in the late 1990s and early 2000s, largely due to the impact of digital technology, the changes in national copyright legislations for compliance with [[Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights|TRIPS]], and the enactment of [[anti-circumvention rules]] in response to the [[WIPO Copyright Treaty]].&lt;ref&gt;http://assembly.coe.int/Main.asp?link=/Documents/WorkingDocs/Doc10/EDOC12101.htm {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100911023036/http://assembly.coe.int/Main.asp?link=%2FDocuments%2FWorkingDocs%2FDoc10%2FEDOC12101.htm |date=11 September 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[European People's Party]] concluded that international instruments for the protection of copyright no longer seem capable of guaranteeing creators and investors a fair return on their activities while ensuring the public’s access to information and respect for privacy.

Defenders of copyright exceptions fear that technology, contract law undermining copyright law and copyright law not being amended, is reducing the scope of important exceptions and therefore harming creativity.

In May 2010 a declaration entitled [[Copyright for Creativity]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.copyright4creativity.eu/bin/view/Main/PressRelease05May2010 Copyright for Creativity.Broad coalition calls for European copyright to support digital creativity and innovation] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20110706012409/http://www.copyright4creativity.eu/bin/view/Main/PressRelease05May2010 |date=6 July 2011 }} 5 May 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; was launched, stating: "While exclusive rights have been adapted and harmonised to meet the challenges of the [[knowledge economy]], copyright’s exceptions are radically out of line with the needs of the modern information society. The lack of harmonisation of exceptions hinders the circulation of knowledge based goods and services across Europe. The lack of flexibility within the current European exceptions regime also prevents us from adapting to a constantly changing technological environment." This ad-hoc coalition is being registered at the official EU Transparency Register in the section In-house lobbyists.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://ec.europa.eu/transparencyregister/public/consultation/displaylobbyist.do?id=342464912839-08&amp;locale=en#en |title = EU Transparency Register - Display Lobbyist |publisher=European Union |accessdate=25 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Coordinator of this project runs a Brussels-based public affairs &amp; government relations firm specialised in the online environment, that mainly mentions ''Industry'' (a.o.

==Competition law / anti-trust law==
Copyright is typically thought of as a limited, legally sanctioned [[monopoly]].&lt;ref name="WIPO p7"&gt;{{Cite book| title = WIPO Guide on the Licensing of Copyright and Related Rights| publisher = [[World Intellectual Property Organization]] | issue= 897 of WIPO publication| year = 2004 | pages = 7 | url = https://www.google.com/books?id=LvRRvXBIi8MC&amp;dq=copyright+transfer+and+licensing&amp;as_brr=3&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s | isbn =978-92-805-1271-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because of this, copyright licensing may sometimes interfere too much in free and competitive markets.&lt;ref name="Port"&gt;{{Cite book| title = Licensing Intellectual Property in the Information Age | author=Kenneth L. Port | publisher=Carolina Academic Press | edition=2nd | year=2005 | pages=425–566 | isbn=0-89089-890-1 }}&lt;/ref&gt; These concerns are governed by legal doctrines such as [[competition law]] in the [[European Union]], [[United States antitrust law|anti-trust law]] in the [[United States]], and anti-monopoly law in [[Russian competition law|Russia]] and [[Japanese competition law|Japan]].&lt;ref name="Port" /&gt; Competition issues may arise when the licensing party unfairly leverages market power, engages in [[price discrimination]] through its licensing terms, or otherwise uses a licensing agreement in a discriminatory or unfair manner.&lt;ref name="WIPO p7" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Port" /&gt; Attempts to extend the [[copyright term]] granted by law &amp;ndash; for example, by collecting [[royalties]] for use of the work after its copyright term has expired and it has passed into the [[public domain]] &amp;ndash; raise such competition concerns.&lt;ref name="WIPO p7"/&gt;

In April 1995, the US published "Antitrust Guidelines for the licensing of Intellectual Property" which apply to [[patents]], copyright, and [[trade secrets]]. In January 1996, the [[European Union]] published Commission Regulation No. 240/96 which applies to patents, copyright, and other intellectual property rights, especially regarding licenses. The guidelines apply ''[[mutatis mutandis]]'' to the extent possible.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| title = WIPO Guide on the Licensing of Copyright and Related Rights| publisher = [[World Intellectual Property Organization]] | issue= 897 of WIPO publication| year = 2004 | pages = 78 | url = https://www.google.com/books?id=LvRRvXBIi8MC&amp;dq=copyright+transfer+and+licensing&amp;as_brr=3&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s | isbn =978-92-805-1271-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The interplay of copyright law and competition law is increasingly important in the digital world, as most countries' laws allow private contracts to over-ride copyright law. Given that copyright law creates a legally sanctioned [[monopoly]], balanced by "limitations and exceptions" that allow access without the permission of the copyright holder the over-riding of copyright law by private contracts can create monopoly activity. Well known limitations and exceptions include [[fair dealing]] in the [[UK]] and [[Canada]], as well as the [[fair use]] doctrine in the US. The undermining of copyright law, and in particular limitations and exceptions to copyright by [[contract law]] is an issue frequently raised by libraries, and library groups such as [[International Federation of Library Associations and Institutions]]. As a result of this, this issue is increasingly being looked at and discussed at a national governmental level e.g. UK &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ipo.gov.uk/pro-ipresearch.htm?sabip=/contractlaw-workshop.pdf|date=October 2010|title=The Relationship Between Copyright Law and Contract Law }}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as international level such as [[WIPO]] – as part of the Development Agenda.

==International legal instruments==
Limitations and exceptions are also the subject of significant regulation by global treaties. These treaties have [[harmonization|harmonized]] the exclusive rights which must be provided by copyright laws, and the [[Berne three-step test]] operates to constrain the kinds of copyright exceptions and limitations which individual nations can enact.

On the other hand, there are very few requirements in international copyright treaties placed on national governments to provide any exemptions from exclusive rights. One such case is Article 10(1) of the [[Berne Convention for the Protection of Literary and Artistic Works|Berne Convention]], which guarantees a limited right to make quotations from copyrighted works.

Because of the lack of balance in international treaties in October 2004, WIPO agreed to adopt a significant proposal offered by [[Argentina]] and [[Brazil]], the "Proposal for the Establishment of a Development Agenda for WIPO" also known simply as the "Development Agenda" - from the [[Geneva Declaration on the Future of the World Intellectual Property Organization]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cptech.org/ip/wipo/genevadeclaration.html Consumer Project on Technology web site, ''Geneva Declaration on the Future of the World Intellectual Property Organization'']&lt;/ref&gt; This proposal was well supported by developing countries. A number of civil society bodies have been working on a draft Access to Knowledge,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cptech.org/a2k/ Consumer Project on Technology web site, ''Access to Knowledge (A2K)]&lt;/ref&gt; or A2K, Treaty which they would like to see introduced.

==National laws==
Two important examples of limitations and exceptions to copyright are the [[fair use]] doctrine found in the United States, and the [[fair dealing]] doctrine found in many other [[common law]] countries. Other more fundamental boundaries of copyright are caused by [[threshold of originality|thresholds of originality]], a threshold below which objects cease to be copyrightable, the [[Idea-expression divide|idea-expression dichotomy]], the [[public domain]] and the effect of [[Crown copyright]]. Even copyright maximalists might interpret these as ''defining'' copyright, rather than being "limitations" or "exceptions" to it. In addition copyright can only protect the artist's expression of his/her work and not the ideas, systems, or factual information conveyed in it.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mtsu.edu/~itconf/proceed03/98.html The Wrinkle in Your Research and Teaching: Copyright, DMCA, Guidelines, and Public Domain] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060918060155/http://www.mtsu.edu/~itconf/proceed03/98.html |date=18 September 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Likewise, the U.S. courts have determined that [[stock character]]s are also uncopyrightable.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Nichols v. Universal Pictures Corp.]]'', [[Case citation|45 F.2d 119]] ([[2d Cir.]] 1930).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''[[Fighter's History|Capcom U.S.A. Inc. v. Data East Corp.]]''

While [[fair use]] in the United States is popularly understood as the only limitation to an author's exclusive rights, it is only one of several important limitations. Section 106 of the U.S. copyright law, which defines [http://www.copyright.gov/title17/92chap1.html#106 the exclusive rights in copyrighted works], is subject to [http://www.copyright.gov/title17/92chap1.html#107 sections 107 through 122], which limit the copyright holder's exclusive rights.

In the U.S. in stark contrast to those copyright laws which have developed from [[English law]], [[edict of government|edicts of government]] are not subject to copyright, including edicts of foreign governments.

'''Maribor Town Hall''' ({{lang-sl|Mariborski rotovž}}) is the [[town hall]] of [[Maribor]], [[Slovenia]]. It is situated on the town's [[Main Square, Maribor|Main Square]] ({{lang|sl|Glavni trg}}). 

Built in 1515, it was remodeled in [[Renaissance]] style between 1563 and 1565.  In the mid-19th century, it was again renovated in the late [[Classical architecture|Classical]] style, but was later restored to its original 16th-century appearance.

[[Adolf Hitler]] addressed local [[Germans]] from the building's main balcony, overlooking the square (), during his brief 1941 visit to the city.

In addition to city offices, the hall also houses a  [[Cuisine of Slovenia|Slovene national cuisine]] restaurant, ''Toti Rotovž.''

In the square outside the hall there stands the [[Plague Memorial, Maribor|Plague Memorial]], which commemorates the “[[black death]]” that devastated the city in 1680.

'''''Murdering Airplane''''' (1920) is a [[collage]] by the [[Germany|German]] [[Dada|dadaist]] [[Max Ernst]]. It depicts a monstrous aircraft with human arms flying over an open field. In the lower right-hand corner two soldiers are carrying a third wounded soldier.

The Dada movement was created partly as a critical response to [[World War I]]. This had a special significance to Ernst who served in the war. This work was a statement on the advent of aerial warfare that occurred in that war.

'''Nabil Shaban''' (born 12 February 1953&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.screenonline.org.uk/people/id/589316 Profile], screenonline.org.uk; retrieved 1 August 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;) is a Jordanian-British actor and writer. He founded [[Graeae Theatre Company|The Graeae]]—a theatre group which promotes performers with [[disability|disabilities]].

==Early years and career==
{{unsourced|section|date=January 2018}}
Shaban was born in [[Amman]], Jordan. He studied at the [[University of Surrey]] in the late 1970s and contributed to the Students' Union newspaper "Bare Facts". In 1997, Shaban was awarded an Honorary Doctorate by the university for services in the promotion of Disability Arts.

One of his most memorable television roles was that of the reptilian alien [[Sil (Doctor Who)|Sil]] in the [[BBC]] science fiction television series ''[[Doctor Who]]''. Shaban played Sil in two serials: ''[[Vengeance on Varos]]'' (1985) and ''[[Mindwarp]]'' (1986), and created Sil's laugh. He reprised the role in the [[Big Finish Productions|Big Finish]] audio dramas ''[[Mission to Magnus]]'' (2009) and ''[[Antidote to Oblivion]]'' (2013), both again written by [[Philip Martin (screenwriter)|Philip Martin]].

He has appeared in several films, including ''Born of Fire'' (1983), ''[[City of Joy]]'' (1992), Derek Jarman's ''[[Wittgenstein (film)|Wittgenstein]]'' (1993), ''Gaias børn'' (1998), and ''[[Children of Men]]'' (2006), and has also worked as part of the [[Crass Collective]]. In 2011, he played the Roman emperor [[Constantius II]] at the National Theatre in Ibsen's ''[[Emperor and Galilean]]''.

In 2003 he made a TV documentary titled ''The Strangest Viking'' (part of [[Channel 4]]'s ''[[Secret History (TV series)|Secret History]]'' series), in which Shaban explored the possibility that Viking chieftain [[Ivar the Boneless]] may have had [[osteogenesis imperfecta]], the same condition he himself has. Shaban has also published a trilogy of Ivar the Boneless screenplays on Kindle, representing the Viking chieftain as a disabled Danish prince with brittle bones and unable to walk.

Shaban was nominated Best Actor in Scottish theatre in 2005, by the Critics' Awards for Theatre in Scotland (CATS), for his role as [[Mack the Knife]] in [[Bertolt Brecht]]'s ''[[The Threepenny Opera|Threepenny Opera]]'', a [[Theatre Workshop Scotland|Theatre Workshop (Edinburgh)]] production. Shaban lost out to rival nominee [[David Tennant]], who was about to become the new [[Doctor (Doctor Who)|Doctor Who]].

Shaban's play ''The First To Go'' premièred in May 2008, produced by Edinburgh's Benchtours Theatre Company in association with Sirius Pictures. It opened at the [[Royal Lyceum Theatre|Lyceum Theatre]] in Edinburgh on 23 May and toured to the [[Tron Theatre]], Glasgow; the [[Byre Theatre]], St Andrews and [[Lawrence Batley Theatre]], Huddersfield.

'''Popular history''' is a broad and somewhat ill-defined [[genre]] of [[historiography]] that takes a popular approach, aims at a wide readership, and usually emphasizes [[narrative]], [[Personality type|personality]] and vivid detail over scholarly analysis. The term is used in contradistinction to professional academic or scholarly history writing which is usually more specialized and technical and, thus, less accessible to the general reader.

Some popular historians are without academic affiliation while others are academics, or former academics, that have (according to one writer) "become somehow abstracted from the academic arena, becoming cultural commentators".&lt;ref&gt;De Groot, Jerome (2009), [https://books.google.com/books?id=hexpdOj8t80C&amp;pg=PA15&amp;lpg=PA15&amp;dq=%22popular+historian%22&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=yvNFz2kvUh&amp;sig=io51iX8gENuqr0egzP2J9JpLwGM&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=ZBSxSpqCKYmf8Qbh7MHCDg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=3#v=onepage&amp;q=%22popular%20historian%22&amp;f=false ''Consuming History: Historians and Heritage in Contemporary Popular Culture''], [[Routledge]], pg 15.&lt;/ref&gt; Many worked as journalists, perhaps after taking an initial degree in history.

Popular historians may become nationally renowned or best-selling authors and may or may not serve the interests of particular political viewpoints in their roles as "public historians". Many authors of "official histories" and "authorized biographies" would qualify as popular historians serving the interests of particular institutions or public figures.

Popular historians aim to appear on the "general lists" of general publishers, rather than the [[university press]]es that have dominated [[academic publishing]] in recent years. Increasingly, popular historians have taken to television where they are able, often accompanying a series of documentaries with a [[tie-in]] book.

Recent examples of American popular historians with academic affiliations include [[Stephen Ambrose]], [[Doris Kearns Goodwin]] and [[Pauline Maier]]. Non-academics include [[Bruce Catton]], [[Shelby Foote]], [[David McCullough]], [[Daniel Boorstin]] and [[Barbara Tuchman]].

Recent examples of British popular historians who are also academics include [[Niall Ferguson]], [[Christopher Hibbert]] and [[Simon Schama]], and – from a previous generation – [[Eric Hobsbawm]], [[Paul Johnson (writer)|Paul Johnson]], [[E. P. Thompson]], [[A. J. P. Taylor]] (an early pioneer of history on television) and [[Christopher Hill (historian)|Christopher Hill]]. Much of [[Hugh Trevor-Roper]]'s output was also directed at a popular audience.

[[John Julius Norwich]], [[Nirad Chaudhuri]], [[Ramchandra Guha]], [[Charles Allen (writer)|Charles Allen]] and [[Tariq Ali]] are popular historians who have never been academics.

[[File:Peristyle of Diocletian's Palace, Split (11908116224).jpg|right|thumb|The [[peristyle]] of [[Diocletian's Palace]].]]
'''Red Peristyle''' ({{lang-hr|Crveni peristil}}) was an [[Urban Interventionism|urban intervention]] in [[Diocletian's Palace]] in the city of [[Split (city)|Split]], [[Croatia]], performed on 11 January 1968, when its [[peristyle]] (main court) was painted red. This was also the name of the group responsible for the intervention, which was formed in 1966.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|editor1-last=Đurić|editor1-first=Dubravka|editor2-last=Šuvaković|editor2-first=Miško|editor2-link=Miško Šuvaković|title=Impossible Histories: Historical Avant-gardes, Neo-avant-gardes, and Post-avant-gardes in Yugoslavia, 1918-1991|date=2006|publisher=[[MIT Press]]|location=Cambridge, Massachusetts|isbn=9780262042161|page=220|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=c8ZbINFYdVoC&amp;pg=PA220&amp;dq=Red+Peristyle+split&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=MTH1S5alCMGOkQXn4NXlCA&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=Red%20Peristyle%20split&amp;f=false|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; The group had a destructive approach similar to [[Marcel Duchamp]]'s post-urban art of the 1960s. A number of other actions were recognized as the work of the same artistic group.

This illegal attack on public property was made more controversial by the choice of the color. It was seen as an act of provocation towards [[communism]] in the [[Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia|former Yugoslavia]]. It was also prosecuted by the authorities as vandalism. Only one art historian, [[Cvito Fisković]], made a statement in defense of the artists. Two of them, Pave Dulčić and Tomo Ćaleta, committed suicide, whereas {{Interlanguage link multi|Nenad Đapić|de|3=Nenad Djapic}} and one other did not speak about the event. A myth of the Red Peristyle evolved and created a group of new "[[anti-heroes]]".

'''''Rough Night''''' (released in some countries as '''''Girls' Night Out'''''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.impawards.com/2017/rough_night_ver11_xlg.html |title=Rough Night (#11 of 17): Extra Large Movie Poster Image |publisher=IMP Awards |date= |accessdate=2017-11-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;) is a 2017 American [[comedy film]] directed by [[Lucia Aniello]] (in her feature debut) and written by Aniello and [[Paul W. Downs]]. It stars [[Scarlett Johansson]], [[Zoë Kravitz]], [[Kate McKinnon]], [[Jillian Bell]], [[Ilana Glazer]], Downs, [[Ty Burrell]], and [[Demi Moore]], and follows a bachelorette party that goes wrong after a male stripper dies.

The film was released in the United States on June 16, 2017, by [[Columbia Pictures]], received mixed reviews and grossed $47 million worldwide against a production budget of about $26 million.

== Plot ==
In 2006, four friends, Jess, Alice, Frankie and Blair, bond during their first year of college at [[George Washington University]]. A decade later they reunite as Jess is about to get married to her fiancé Peter, and Alice decides that the four should spend the weekend in Miami partying. By this point, Alice is a teacher, Frankie is an aspiring activist with two strikes on her record, Blair is a real estate agent in the middle of a bitter divorce who still has conflicting feelings over her past relationship with Frankie, and Jess is an aspiring senatorial candidate whose campaign is hampered by the fact that the general public do not find her relatable despite her policies focusing on helping others.

Once in Miami, the four are joined by Pippa, Jess's friend from her semester in Australia. The friends get high and party at a club and then Frankie decides to hire a male stripper, Jay. When Jay arrives at the door, he makes Jess uncomfortable with his rough talk. Alice decides to take a turn and jumps on him, causing them to both fall and Jay to hit his head on the edge of the fireplace, killing him. Before they decide what to do, Jess takes a call from Peter and mentions during her panic that her friends hired a stripper and she is confused, before Alice destroys her phone and Blair confiscates the others to prevent anyone making calls until they can determine their next move. Peter takes this to mean that Jess is leaving him and decides to race down to Miami to convince Jess to take him back.

The friends purchase a burner phone and call Blair's uncle, who is a lawyer. After telling him they moved the body, he tells them that, while they may have gotten away with accidental death if they had made the call immediately, they could face up to fifteen years in prison for tampering with the crime scene unless no body is found. The friends decide to dispose of the body by throwing it into the ocean. After doing so, they realize that their neighbors, Lea and Pietro, have a security camera that may have caught them. They send Blair to get the tape, as the pair had previously expressed interest in a ''[[ménage à trois]]'' with Blair, only to have her discover the cameras do not work after she has slept with them. By this point, the body has washed up on the shore and they must come up with a new plan to dispose of it.

A police officer, Scotty, knocks on their door and Frankie knocks him out after he gropes her, only for the friends to realize that he was the actual stripper they had ordered, leaving them to wonder whom they killed. They use Scotty's car to try to dispose of the body again only to return home defeated after a car accident when the car goes over a speed bump too quickly. Then when Alice finds out Jess invited Frankie and Blair to a bridal shower over her, Jess verbally berates her for her obsessive clinginess and storms off to prepare for the consequences.

At this point, Detectives Frazier and Ruiz arrive and tell the women they are not in trouble, as the man they killed was a violent criminal who had been on the run from the police. As they interrogate the women, Pippa realizes that the detectives are actually the accomplices of the man they killed when she spots the TV displaying all three men as suspects in a jewelry robbery. Realizing that they are caught, Frazier and Ruiz tie the women and Scotty up and threaten to shoot them. Jess meanwhile has missed most of the drama due to being upstairs taking a shower in preparation for her mugshot. Realizing what has happened, she manages to subdue Frazier using hairspray and handcuffs when he comes up to search for the diamonds, and kills Ruiz as he prepares to kill Blair. Frazier returns, having freed himself from the toy handcuffs, only to be run over when Peter, high on the drugs he took to keep him awake on his roadtrip to Miami, crashes into the front of the house and kills him.

Jess reaffirms that she wants to marry Peter and the two wed that weekend. Frankie and Blair decide to reunite as a couple and Alice hooks up with Scotty. Pippa confirms that the police have dismissed all charges as their victims were all criminals, and the deaths can be excused as self-defense. Jess receives a call from her campaign manager revealing that these events have caused her approval rating to go up significantly with the voters after capturing dangerous criminals; in addition to her new reputation as a party girl has helped make her more relateable to voters.

In a post-credits scene, Jess and Peter drive Alice home after a night out. Alice enters her apartment and looks for something to eat. She pours pasta into a pan, and discovers that there are diamonds mixed in with the pasta—the same diamonds that Jay stashed in their house for safekeeping.

'''Russian lacquer art''' developed from the art of [[Russian icons|icon]] painting which came to an end with the collapse of [[Russian Empire|Imperial Russia]]. The icon painters, who previously had been employed by supplying not only churches but people's homes, needed a way to make a living. Thus, the craft of making [[papier-mâché]] decorative boxes and panels developed, the items were [[lacquer]]ed and then hand painted by the artists, often with scenes from folk tales.

==The four centers of Russian lacquer art==
The village of [[Fedoskino miniature|Fedoskino]] (Федоскино)[http://www.instaplanet.com/fedoskino.html], located not far from [[Moscow]] on the banks of the [[Ucha River]], is the oldest of the four art centers of Russian lacquer miniature painting on [[papier-mâché]], which has been practiced there since 1795. It stands apart both geographically, and in that that oil paints are used rather than [[egg tempera]]. While allowing the artist a free hand in [[Impressionism|impressionistic]] interpretation, the style of Fedoskino painting is largely realistic in composition and detail.

The other three Russian lacquer art centers are:

*[[Kholuy miniature|Kholuy]] (Kholuy, Kholuj, Holui - Холуй)
*[[Mstyora miniature|Mstyora]] (Мстёра)

The lacquer artists of Palekh, Kholui and Mstera continue to use the technique of painting in egg-based tempera overlaid with intricate gold leaf highlighting.''

All three are situated in the [[Vladimir-Suzdal]] Principality, Ivanovo region of central [[Russia]], and are deeply rooted in the 17th-19th century [[icon]] painting tradition, which lasted until the [[Russian Revolution of 1917]] and is now being revived by young artists of the 21st century.

'''Stephanie McMillan''' (born 1965) is an American political cartoonist, editorialist, and activist from [[South Florida]]. A granddaughter of the German commercial animator [[Hans Fischerkoesen]], McMillan aspired to become a cartoonist from the age of ten. During her high school years, she began organizing protests against capitalism and imperialism.

==Early life and career==
McMillan graduated from [[Tisch School of the Arts]] at [[New York University]] in 1987 with a BFA in film. During her time at NYU, she studied animation under Richard Protovin and [[John Canemaker]], and received an award for her student film.  In 1992, McMillan was offered her first professional cartooning opportunity as an editorial assistant at XS- magazine/City Link, an alt-newsweekly. By 1999, McMillan began self-syndicating her cartoons, as well as providing exclusive comic features and illustrations for hundreds of publications worldwide. Her work has appeared in the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'', ''[[Daily Beast]]'', ''[[South Florida Sun-Sentinel]]'', ''[[Yes! (U.S. magazine)|Yes! Magazine]]'', ''[[Comic Relief]]'', ''[[Amarillo Globe-News]]'', ''[[Funny Times (newspaper)|Funny Times]]'', [[Yahoo.com]], and the ''[[San Francisco Bay Guardian]]''.
 
Beyond her professional cartooning, McMillan has been an organizer against capitalism and imperialism all her life. The groups she has worked with include One Struggle, Refuse and Resist!, the [[Occupy movement]] throughout the country, U.S. Hands Off the Haitian People's Coalition, and the Revolutionary Communist Youth Brigade. In 2012, McMillan won the [[Robert F. Kennedy Journalism Award]] for Editorial Cartoonists for her work as a political cartoonist.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Cavna|first1=Michael|title=Stephanie McMillan wins RFK Journalism Award for social-justice cartoons|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/comic-riffs/post/stephanie-mcmillan-wins-rfk-journalism-award-for-social-justice-cartoons/2012/05/09/gIQAXxTvBU_blog.html|work=Washington Post|date=9 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Currently, McMillan’s daily comic strip, [[Minimum Security]], is syndicated online at [[Universal Uclick]]’s gocomics.com. She also draws a weekly editorial cartoon, Code Green, acts as an editor and designer for ''[[The Notebook (magazine)|The Notebook]]'' ([[Association of American Editorial Cartoonists]]), and does freelance illustration and writing. Her own books include ''Capitalism Must Die! A Basic Introduction: What capitalism is, why it sucks, and how to crush it'' (INIP -- Idées Nouvelles Idées Prolétariennes, 2014), ''The Beginning of the American Fall'' ([[Seven Stories Press]], 2012), and ''As The World Burns: 50 Simple Things You Can Do to Stay in Denial'' with [[Derrick Jensen]] ([[Seven Stories Press]], 2007).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3363">'''The Contemporary African Art Collection (CAAC)''' is a private collection created in 1990 by Italian business man, [[Jean Pigozzi]] after his encounter with French independent curator, André Magnin.  Magnin specializes in art from non-Western cultures, and especially sub-Saharan art.  The CAAC came into being at a time when non-Western contemporary art was largely ignored on the international scene.  It was founded shortly after the seminal exhibition ''The Magicians of the Earth'' at the [[Pompidou Center]] in Paris, curated by Jean-Huber Martin.   It was the first truly international exhibition where contemporary works from all over the world were shown on an equal footing.

The CAAC includes several thousand artworks, featuring sculptures, drawings, photographs, installations and videos,  by over 80 artists, living and working in sub-Saharan African countries.  Some of its artists live in large cities and attended art schools.  Others were "self-taught" and some are from remote areas and work within local traditions that they extend and enrich.

The CAAC regularly organizes exhibitions and artwork loans  in major museums and art foundations around the world, such as [[Tate Modern]] (London), Pompidou Center (Paris), Guggenheim Bilbao, [[Metropolitan Museum]] (NY), [[Museum of Fine Arts, Houston]] (Texas),  [[National Museum of African Art]] (Washington), [[Cartier Foundation]] (Paris) and the [[Saatchi Gallery]] (London).  It also has published several catalogues and monographies.

'''''The Real''''' is an American [[Broadcast syndication|syndicated]] [[talk show]]. The series initially received a trial run on [[Fox Television Stations|Fox owned]] markets in the summer of 2013. The series was developed as a talk show designed to appeal to younger female viewers who, like the co-hosts, were experiencing new events in their lives. It was green-lit for national syndication later that fall and officially premiered the following year.

On January 3, 2018, [[Fox Television Stations]] picked up two more seasons of the series, effectively allowing [[Warner Bros. Television Distribution]] to continue to produce it into the 2019-20 television season.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Petski|first1=Denise|title=‘The Real’ Renewed By Fox TV Stations Through 2020|url=http://deadline.com/2018/01/the-real-renewed-fox-tv-stations-through-2020-1202234929/|website=Deadline Hollywood|accessdate=3 January 2018|date=3 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''The Short North''' is a neighborhood in [[Columbus, Ohio|Columbus]], [[Ohio]], United States, centered on the main strip of High Street immediately north of downtown and extending until just south of the [[Ohio State University]] [[campus]] area.  It is an easy walk from the convention center or [[Nationwide Arena]] district to the south. The Short North is often crowded on weekends, particularly during the monthly "Gallery Hop" and other local and downtown events.

The Short North has been described as "colorful", "offbeat", and "trendy".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Kelley|first=Shawnie|title=Insiders' Guide to Columbus, Ohio, 2nd|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=I6S6f16eE1sC&amp;pg=PA264|year=2008|publisher=Globe Pequot Press|isbn=978-0-7627-4784-9|page=264}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Biddle|first1=Julie King|last2=(MLS.)|first2=Barbara White|title=The Power of We: The Ohio Study Group Experience|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=cE_0d6x1jUsC&amp;pg=PA85|year=2010|publisher=IAP|isbn=978-1-61735-029-0|page=85}}&lt;/ref&gt; The district is heavily populated with [[art gallery|art galleries]], specialty shops, [[pub]]s, [[nightclub]]s, and [[coffee house]]s.  Most of its tightly packed brick buildings date from at least the early 20th century, with traditional storefronts along High Street (often with brightly painted murals on their side walls), and old apartment buildings and [[rowhouse]]s and newer [[condominium]] developments in the surrounding blocks.  The city installed 17 lighted metal archways extending across High Street throughout the Short North, reminiscent of such arches present in the area in the early 1900s.

The area is also known to be a very [[gay]]- and [[lesbian]]-friendly neighborhood which contains numerous gay nightclubs and bars and hosts the annual Columbus gay [[Columbus Pride|pride parade]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Parade|url=https://columbuspride.org/parade/|website=Stonewall Columbus|publisher=Stonewall Columbus|accessdate=5 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The name "Short North" traces its roots back to the vernacular used by police for the area during a period of decline, namely as the neighborhood that—from a suburban commuter's perspective—had fallen 'just short' of the central business district's north end—both physically and economically. A reputation for diversity and an artistic,&lt;ref name=NYT&gt;[http://travel.nytimes.com/2010/03/14/travel/14headsup.html "Hello, Columbus"], Ingrid Williams. New York Times. 14 mar 2010. Retrieved 6 sept 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Bohemianism|Bohemian]] atmosphere has marked the Short North, with land prices and local rents rising steadily from the humble beginnings as a squatter’s neighborhood in the 1980s.  Prior to this gentrification of the neighborhood which originated from artists,&lt;ref name=NYT /&gt; it had suffered prolonged decay and from latent, street-level crime and gang violence as Columbus affluent residents followed the economic bubble outward—into the [[suburb]]s—during the 1960s and 1970s.

The 1980s saw the neighborhood's rebirth enter into full gear as galleries began to open up and started to flourish. As Maria Gallowy owner of [[pm gallery]] the oldest gallery in the Short North once put it "It was one of those neighborhoods that artists love to move into because the possibilities are there."&lt;ref name=NYT /&gt; In 1984 two Short North area galleries —the now defunct Art Reach and the still thriving pm gallery— began opening new exhibits on the first Saturday of every month to help cross-promote their businesses and build a more unified community.&lt;ref name=NYT /&gt; This loose coordination later evolved into the [[Gallery Hop]] which is still held every first Saturday of the month. The Gallery Hop today features most businesses keeping their doors open late into the night, jam-packed streets, and sidewalks populated with street musicians and other performers.

Since 1983, the Short North has also hosted the annual [[Doo Dah Parade]], a parody of typical [[Independence Day (United States)|Fourth of July]] parades that includes politically slanted paraders and floats as well as absurdities such as the "Marching Fidels," a band of [[Fidel Castro]] lookalikes.  The parade starts in neighboring [[Victorian Village]], at [[Goodale Park]], and winds north to finish coming south down High Street.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Doo Dah Parade|url=http://www.doodahparade.com/|website=The Doo Dah Parade|publisher=The Friends of Doo Dah|accessdate=5 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Short North also hosts HighBall Halloween, Masquerade on High, a fashion show and street parade that closes down High Street. In 2011, in its 4th year, HighBall Halloween gained notoriety as it accepted its first Expy award. HighBall Halloween has much to offer for those interested in fashion and the performing and visual arts or for those who want to celebrate Halloween and with food and drinks from all around the city. Each year the event is put on with a different theme and it increases in size and popularity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=HighBall - You Are What You Wear|url=http://highballcolumbus.org/|website=HighBall Columbus|accessdate=15 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Synopsis==

[[File:Heinrich Vogeler - Illustration Die sechs Schwäne.jpg|thumb|Illustration by [[Heinrich Vogeler]]]]

A King gets lost in a forest, and an old woman helps him, on the condition that he marry her beautiful daughter. The King has a bad feeling about this but accepts anyway. He has six sons and a daughter from his first marriage, however, and fears that the children will be targeted by his new wife; so he sends them away and visits them in secret. 

The new queen and now [[stepmother]], who has learned witchcraft from her mother, finds out about her stepchildren and decides to get them out of her way. She sews six magical shirts and goes to the hidden castle where the children are hidden for safety, then tosses the shirts over the boys and transforms them into [[swan]]s. 

The brothers can only take their human forms for fifteen minutes every evening. They tell their still human younger sister that they've heard of a way to break such curses: she must make six shirts out of [[nettle]]s and can't make a sound for six years or the spell will never be broken. The girl agrees to do this and runs away, hiding in a hunter's hut and dedicating herself solely to gathering the nettles and sewing in silence.

Years later, the King of another country finds the girl doing this, is taken by her beauty, and takes her into the court with the intention of making her his queen. However, the King's snobbish mother hates her and does not consider her fit to be a Queen. When she gives birth to their first child, the wicked mother-in-law takes away the child and accuses the queen of killing and eating him, but the King refuses to believe it. 

The young Queen gives birth to two other children, but twice again the mother-in-law hides them away and falsely claims that she has killed and eaten her babies. The King is unable to keep protecting her, and unable to properly defend herself, the queen is sentenced to be [[Death by burning|burned at the stake]] as a witch. All this time, she has held back her tears and her words, sewing and sewing the nettle shirts no matter what.

On the day of her execution, the Queen has all but finished making the shirts for her brothers. Only the last shirt misses a left arm. When she is brought to the stake she takes the shirts with her and when she is about to be burned, the seven years expire and the six swans come flying through the air. She throws the shirts over her brothers and they regain their human form, though the youngest prince's left arm remains a wing due to the missing sleeve. 

The queen is now free to speak, and she can defend herself against the accusations. She does so with the support of her brothers. In the end, the evil mother-in-law is the one who is burned at the stake as punishment.

==Adaptations==
* ''[[Daughter of the Forest]]'', the first book of the [[Sevenwaters trilogy]] by [[Juliet Marillier]], is a detailed retelling of this story in a medieval [[Celts|Celtic]] setting. A young woman named Sorcha must sew six shirts from a painful nettle plant in order to save her brothers (Liam, Diarmuid, Cormack, Connor, Finbar and Padriac) from the witch Lady Oonagh's enchantment, remaining completely mute until the task is finished. Falling in love with a British lord, Hugh of Harrowfield alias "Red", complicates her mission.

* An episode from the anime series ''[[Grimm's Fairy Tale Classics]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=http://www.showtime.jp/app/detail/contents/l15vid200206901088352/ |title=新グリム名作劇場 第10話 六羽の白鳥 &amp;#124; アニメ &amp;#124; 動画はShowTime (ショウタイム) |website=Web.archive.org |date=2013-06-22 |accessdate=2016-06-05 |deadurl=unfit |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130622031028/http://www.showtime.jp/app/detail/contents/l15vid200206901088352/ |archivedate=June 22, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; starring [[Mitsuko Horie]] as the Princess (here named Elise), [[Toshiko Fujita]] as the witch, [[Hideyuki Hori]] as the prince, [[Ishizuka Unsho]] as the king, and [[Koichi Yamadera]], [[Taku Takemura]], [[Masami Kikuchi]], and Keiichi Naniwa as the brothers. This plot differs in some parts from the Grimm's version, especially in the second part of the story. In the anime, the evil stepmother-queen kills her husband and puts a spell on his children to gain total control of the kingdom like in the original, but later she takes up the role of the Princess/Queen's evil mother-in-law and leaves Elise's baby son (her only child) in the forest. The swan-brothers find their nephew the forest and keep him alive, plus they're stuck in their swan forms all day/night long (though they still can speak) until their sister breaks the curse and they give her the baby back. Elise finishes the garments in time, therefore the youngest is not left with a swan wing in the end. When the wicked stepmother is exposed as the witch ''and'' as the one who framed Elise at the end, she uses her magic in an attempt to escape but then accidentally catches fire from Elise's pyre and burns to death.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKPtShfBadw |title=GFTC - The Six Swans |publisher=[[YouTube]] |date=2014-05-28 |accessdate=2018-01-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* [[Paul Weiland]]'s episode "The Three Ravens" of [[Jim Henson]]'s television series ''[[The Storyteller]]'' is another retelling of this classic tale. After the queen dies, an evil witch ensnares the king and turn his three sons into [[raven]]s. The princess escapes and must stay silent for three years, three months, three weeks and three days to break the spell. But after she meets a handsome prince, this is suddenly not so easy, for her stepmother has killed her father and remarried - to the prince's father. But when the witch attempts to burn the princess at the stake, the ravens attack her and she accidentally sets fire to herself instead, instantly turning into ashes. Her death almost fully reverses the spell, but the princess breaks her silence three minutes too soon, and her youngest brother subsequently keeps one wing forever.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.angelfire.com/me3/muppets/Story_ThreeRavens.html |title=The Storyteller Presents The Three Ravens |website=Angelfire.com |date= |accessdate=2016-06-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* The novel ''Birdwing'' by Rafe Martin follows the youngest prince, human but with a wing instead of his left arm, as he grows up with this "deformity."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rafemartin.com/bk_birdwing.html |title=Rafe Martin-Birdwing |website=Rafemartin.com |date= |accessdate=2016-06-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* ''Moonlight'' features a thirteen-year-old princess named Aowyn who loses her mother to a mysterious illness, and is charged with protecting her father and her six brothers from the conniving of a witch bent on taking the throne. This retelling is written by Ann Hunter and set on the Summer Isle, an alternate Ireland.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Ann Hunter |url=http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/20620664-moonlight |title=Moonlight by Ann Hunter — Reviews, Discussion, Bookclubs, Lists |website=Goodreads.com |date= |accessdate=2016-06-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Adam Savage HOPE.jpg|thumb|Video feedback of [[Adam Savage]]]]

'''Video feedback''' is the process that starts and continues when a [[video camera]] is pointed at its own playback [[video monitor]]. The loop delay from camera to display back to camera is at least one [[video]] frame time, due to the input and output scanning processes; it can be more if there is more processing in the loop.

==History==
First discovered shortly after [[Charlie Ginsburg]] invented the first video recorder for [[Ampex]] in 1956, video feedback was considered a nuisance and unwanted noise.{{citation needed|date=November 2014}} Technicians and studio camera people were chastised for allowing a video camera to see its own monitor as the overload of self-amplified video signal wreaked havoc with the 1950s video pickup, often ruining the pickup.{{citation needed|date=November 2014}} It could also cause [[screen burn-in]] on a playback TV and/or monitors of the time as well, by generating static brightly illuminated display patterns.

In the 1960s early examples of video feedback art become introduced into the [[psychedelic art]] scene in [[New York City]]. [[Nam June Paik]] is often cited as the first [[video art]]ist, although this is disputed; he had clips of video feedback on display in New York City at the [[Greenwich Cafe]] in the mid 1960s. 

Early video feedback works were created by media artist/experimenters on the East and West Coasts in the late 1960s and early 70's. Video feedback artists [[Steina and Woody Vasulka]], with [[Richard Lowenberg]] and others, formed The Kitchen, which was located in the kitchen of a broken-down hotel in lower Manhattan; while [[Skip Sweeney]] and others founded Video Free America in San Francisco, to nurture their video art and feedback experiments.

[[David Sohn]] mentions video feedback in his 1970 book ''Film, the Creative Eye''. This book was part of the base curriculum for [[Richard Lederer]] of [[St. Paul's School (Concord, New Hampshire)|St. Paul's School]] in [[Concord, New Hampshire]], when he introduced making videofeedback as part of an English curriculum in his 1970s course Creative Eye in Film. Several students in this class participated regularly in the making and recording of videofeedback. [[Sony]] had released the VuMax series of recording video cameras and manually "hand-looped" video tape decks by this time which did two things: it increased the resolution of the video image, which made the picture more attractive, and it brought video tape recording technology within the general public's grasp for the first time and allowed for such video experimentation to take place by the general public.

During the 1980s and into the 1990s video technology became enhanced and evolved into high quality, high definition video recording. [[Michael C. Andersen]] generated the first known mathematical formula of the videofeedback process, &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.videofeedback.dk/vf/ss/model.gif "Formula for Videofeedback"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110719132859/http://www.videofeedback.dk/vf/ss/model.gif |date=July 19, 2011 }}. videofeedback.dk. Retrieved 2010-12-28.&lt;/ref&gt; and he has also generated a [[Mendeleev]]'s square to show the gradual progressive formulaic change of the video image as certain parameters are adjusted.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.videofeedback.dk/vf/ss/sspost.html "Simulation of video feedback"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091007204011/http://www.videofeedback.dk/vf/ss/sspost.html |date=October 7, 2009 }}. videofeedback.dk. Retrieved 2010-12-28.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1990s the rave scene and a social return to art of a more psychedelic nature brought back displays of video feedback on large disco dance floor video screens around the world. There are filters for Adobe Photoshop and non linear video editors that often have video feedback as the filter description, or as a setting on a filter. These filter types either mimic or directly utilize video feedback for its result effect and can be recognized by its vortex, phantasmagoric manipulation of the original recorded image.

==In entertainment==
Many artists have used optical feedback. An example is [[Queen (band)|Queen's]] music video for "[[Bohemian Rhapsody]]" (1975). The effect (in this simple case) can be compared to looking at oneself between two mirrors.

Other videos that use variations of video feedback include:
* [[Doctor Who]] – ''[[An Unearthly Child]]'' (series, 1963-1973, opening title sequence.)
* [[Earth, Wind &amp; Fire]] — ''[[September (Earth, Wind &amp; Fire song)|September]]'' (1978)
* [[The Jacksons]] – ''[[Blame it on the boogie|Blame It On the Boogie]]'' (1978)
* [[Kate Bush]] – ''[[Hammer_Horror_(song)|Hammer Horror]]'' (1978)
* [[Amii Stewart]] – ''[[Knock on Wood_(song)|Knock on Wood]]'' (1979)
* [[Kool &amp; the Gang]] – ''[[Get Down On It]]'' (1981)
* [[Todd Rundgren]] – ''Something to Fall Back On'' (1985)
* [[Smashing Pumpkins]] – ''[[Ava Adore]]'' (1998)
* [[Klaxons]] – ''[[Gravity's_Rainbow_(song)|Gravity's Rainbow]]'' (2008)
* [[Boxcutter (musician)|Boxcutter]] – ''TV Troubles'' (2011)
* [[Django Django]] – "Life's A Beach" (2012)

The opening titles sequence for the British [[science fiction]] series ''[[Doctor Who]]'' employed this technique from 1963 to 1973 (initially in black and white, redone in 1967 to showcase the show's new [[625-line]] broadcast resolution and feature the [[Doctor (Doctor Who)|Doctor]]'s face ([[Patrick Troughton]] at that time), then redone again, in colour this time, in 1970. The next title sequence for the show, which debuted in 1973, abandoned this technique in favour of [[slit-scan photography]].

== In science ==
[[File:Screenshot Recursion via vlc.png|thumb|128px|left|[[Droste effect]] recursion in [[VLC media player|VLC]], a computer program.]]
[[File:Optical_feedback.jpg|thumb|128px|left|Optical feedback between mirrors.]]
The optical feedback discussed so far—video feedback, created by a camera pointing at its own monitor—is actually just one particular example of optical feedback. Perhaps the most obvious example of optical feedback in science is the [[optical cavity]] found in almost every [[laser]], which typically consists of two mirrors between which light is amplified. In the late 1990s it was found that so-called unstable-cavity lasers produce light beams whose cross-section present a fractal pattern.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v402/n6758/abs/402138a0.html Laser optics: Fractal modes in unstable resonators], [[Nature (journal)|Nature]] Vol. 402, 138 (11 November 1999)&lt;/ref&gt;

Optical feedback in science is often closely related to video feedback, so an understanding of video feedback can be useful for other applications of optical feedback. Video feedback has been used to explain the essence of fractal structure of unstable-cavity laser beams.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.physics.gla.ac.uk/Optics/play/fractalVideoFeedback/ "Fractal video feedback"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110520070401/http://www.physics.gla.ac.uk/Optics/play/fractalVideoFeedback/ |date=May 20, 2011 }}. Optics Group (University of Glasgow). Retrieved 2010-12-28.&lt;/ref&gt; The page [http://www.cse.salford.ac.uk/profiles/gsmcdonald/FractalLasers.php discovery of fractal lasers] gives an account of laser fractals, the developments of this work, links to further reading, and relates the laser context with video feedback systems. 

Video feedback is also useful as an experimental-mathematics tool.  Examples of its use include the creation of [[Fractal]] patterns using [http://www.sweetandfizzy.com/fractals/diagrams.html multiple monitors] or [https://www.webcitation.org/query?url=http://www.geocities.com/CapeCanaveral/Campus/8446/vid_fractals/index.html&amp;date=2009-10-25+06:34:34  multiple images created using mirrors].

The page [https://web.archive.org/web/20061017183543/http://www.videofeedback.dk/World/ video feedback in science] provides an overview.

[http://softology.com.au/videofeedback/videofeedback.htm Softology's Video Feedback page] provides links and information about real and simulated video feedback.

Optical feedback is also found in the [[image intensifier]] tube and its variants. Here the feedback is usually an undesirable phenomenon, where the light generated by the phosphor screen "feeds back" to the photocathode, causing the tube to oscillate, and ruining the image. This is typically suppressed by an aluminum reflective screen deposited on the back of the phosphor screen, or by incorporating a [[microchannel plate detector]].

Optical feedback has been used experimentally in these tubes to amplify an image, in the manner of the cavity laser, but this technique has had limited use.

Optical feedback has also been experimented with as an electron source, since a photocathode-phosphor cell will 'latch' when triggered, providing a steady stream of electrons. See US Patent 4,531,122 for a typical application.

== In philosophy ==
[[Douglas Hofstadter]] discusses video feedback in his book ''[[I Am a Strange Loop]]'' about the human mind and consciousness. He devotes a chapter to describing his experiments with video feedback.
&lt;blockquote&gt;
At some point during the session, I accidentally stuck my hand momentarily in front of the camera's lens. Of course the screen went all dark, but when I removed my hand, the previous pattern did not just pop right back onto the screen, as expected. Instead I saw a different pattern on the screen, but this pattern, unlike anything I'd seen before, was not stationary.&lt;ref name=hofstadter&gt;{{cite book|last=Hofstadter|first=Douglas|title=I Am a Strange loop|year=2007|publisher=Basic Books|location=New York|isbn=978-0-465-03079-8|page=67}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''video synthesizer''' is a device that electronically creates a [[video]] signal.  A video synthesizer is able to generate a variety of visual material without camera input through the use of internal video pattern generators.  It can also accept and "clean up and enhance" or "distort" live television camera imagery. The synthesizer creates a wide range of imagery through purely electronic manipulations. This imagery is visible within the output video signal when this signal is displayed. The output video signal can be viewed on a wide range of conventional video equipment, such as TV monitors, theater video projectors, computer displays, etc.

Video pattern generators may produce static or moving or evolving imagery.  Examples include geometric patterns (in 2D or 3D), subtitle text characters in a particular font, or weather maps.

Imagery from TV cameras can be altered in color or geometrically scaled, tilted, wrapped around objects, and otherwise manipulated.

A particular video synthesizer will offer a subset of possible effects.

== Video Synthesizers as Real Time performance instruments ==

The history of video synthesis is tied to a "real time performance" ethic.  The equipment is usually expected to function on input camera signals the machine has never seen before, delivering a processed signal continuously and with a minimum of delay in response to the ever-changing live video inputs.  Following in the tradition of performance instruments of the audio synthesis world such as the [[Theremin]], video synthesizers were designed with the expectation they would be played in live concert theatrical situations or set up in a studio ready to process a videotape from a playback VCR in real time while recording the results on a second VCR.  Venues of these performances included "Electronic Visualization Events" in Chicago, [http://www.thekitchen.org The Kitchen] in NYC, and museum installations.  Video artist/performer Don Slepian [http://DonSlepian.com] designed, built and performed a foot-controlled Visual Instrument at the Centre Pompidou in Paris (1983) and the NY Open Center that combined [[Genlocking|genlocked]] early micro-computers [[Apple II Plus]] with the Chromaton 14 Video Synthesizer
[http://www.audiovisualizers.com/toolshak/vidsynth/chroma14/chroma14.htm] and channels of colorized video feedback.

Analog and early real time digital synthesizers existed before modern computer 3D modeling.  Typical 3D renderers are not real time, as they concentrate on computing each frame from, for example, a recursive ray tracing algorithm, however long it takes.  This distinguishes them from video synthesizers, which must deliver a new output frame by the time the last one has been shown, and repeat this performance continuously (typically delivering a new frame regularly every 1/60 or 1/50 of a second). The real time constraint results in a difference in design philosophy between these two classes of systems.

Video synthesizers overlap with [[video special effects]] equipment used in real time network television broadcast and post-production situations.  Many innovations in television broadcast equipment as well as computer graphics displays evolved from synthesizers developed in the [[Video art|video artists' community]] and these industries often support "electronic art projects" in this area to show appreciation of this history.

==Confluence of ideas of Electronics and Arts==
Many principles used in the construction of early video synthesizers reflected a healthy and dynamic interplay between electronic requirements and traditional interpretations of artistic forms.
For example, [[Steve Rutt|Rutt]] &amp; [[Bill Etra|Etra]] and [[Daniel J. Sandin|Sandin]] carried forward as an essential principle ideas of [[Robert Moog]] that standardized signal ranges so that any module's output could be connected to "voltage control" any other module's input.  The consequence of this in a machine like the Rutt-Etra was that position, brightness, and color were completely interchangeable and could be used to modulate each other during the processing that led to the final image.  Videotapes by Louise and [[Bill Etra]] and [[Steina and Woody Vasulka]] dramatized this new class of effects. This led to various interpretations of the multi-modal synthesesia of these aspects of the image in dialogues that extended the McLuhanesque language of film criticism of the time.

which used the EMS patchboard system to allow completely flexible connections between module inputs and outputs. The video signals were digital, but they were controlled by analog voltages. There was a digital patchboard for image composition and an analog patchboard for motion control.

==Evolution into Frame Buffers==
Video synthesizers moved from analog to the precision control of digital.  The first digital effects as exemplified by [[Stephen Beck]]'s Video Weavings used digital oscillators optionally linked to horizontal, vertical, or frame resets to generate timing ramps.  These ramps could be gated to create the video image itself and were responsible for its underlying geometric texture.  Schier and Vasulka advanced the state of the art from address counters to programmable (microcodable) [[Am2900|AMD Am2901]] bit slice based address generators.  On the data path, they used 74S181 arithmetic and logic units, previously thought of as a component for doing arithmetic instructions in minicomputers, to process real time video signals, creating new signals representing the sum, difference, AND, XOR, and so on, of two input signals.  These two elements, the address generator, and the video data pipeline, recur as core features of digital video architecture.

The address generator supplied read and write addresses to a real time video memory, which can be thought of as evolution into the most flexible form of gating the address bits together to produce the video.  While the video frame buffer is now present in every computer's graphics card, it has not carried forward a number of features of the early video synths.  The address generator counts in a fixed rectangular pattern from the upper left hand corner of the screen, across each line, to the bottom.  This discarded a whole technology of modifying the image by variations in the read and write addressing sequence provided by the hardware address generators as the image passed through the memory.  Today, address based distortions are more often accomplished by [[blitter]] operations moving data in the memory, rather than changes in video hardware addressing patterns.

These various modules were based on David's design for voltage controlled video amps and became the basis for the ETC studio. He was there when Don McArthur built the SAID. Woody Vasulka and Jeff Schier were close at hand building computer based modules in Buffalo including a frame buffer with ALUs built in, mixers, keyers and colorizers. Wright also worked with [[Gary Hill]] at Woodstock Community Video, where they had a weekly cable show of live video/audio synthesis. Wright has developed his own performance video system, the Video Shredder, and uses it to mesmerize audiences wherever and whenever he can. He's getting quite good at it. His mission is to create a new music of sound and image.

'''Vitaly Ivanovich Tulenev''' ({{lang-ru|Вита́лий Ива́нович Тюле́нев}}; February 28, 1937, [[Leningrad]], USSR &amp;ndash; August 25, 1998, Saint Petersburg, Russia) was a Soviet Russian painter, watercolorist, graphic artist, art teacher, [[Honored Artist of the RSFSR|Honored Artist of the Russian Federation]], lived and worked in Saint Petersburg, regarded as one of the leading representatives of the "left" wing of the [[Leningrad School of Painting|Leningrad school of painting]].&lt;ref&gt;''Sergei V. Ivanov. Unknown Socialist Realism. The Leningrad School.'' - Saint Petersburg: NP-Print Edition, 2007. – pp. 9, 19, 20, 24, 359, 372, 389-407, 445.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Biography ==
'''Vitaly Ivanovich Tulenev''' was born February 28, 1937, in Leningrad, USSR.

In 1956 Vitaly Tulenev was adopted by the Department of painting of the [[Repin Institute of Arts|Leningrad Institute of Painting, Sculpture and Architecture named after Ilya Repin]]. He studied of Piotr Fomin, Viktor Oreshnikov.

In 1962 Vitaly Tulenev graduated from [[Repin Institute of Arts|Ilya Repin Institute]] in [[Evsey Moiseenko]] personal Art Studio. His graduation work was genre painting named "A First furrow".&lt;ref&gt;''Anniversary Directory graduates of Saint Petersburg State Academic Institute of Painting, Sculpture, and Architecture named after Ilya Repin, Russian Academy of Arts. 1915 - 2005''. - Saint Petersburg: Pervotsvet Publishing House, 2007. - p.90.&lt;/ref&gt;

Since 1963 Vitaly Tulenev has participated in Art Exhibitions. Painted portraits, genre and historical pictures, landscapes. Worked in oil painting and watercolors. Solo Exhibitions by Vitaly Tulenev were in Leningrad (1991) and Saint Petersburg (1997).

Since the end of 1960s traditional realism in paintings of Vitali Tulenev replaced by mystical stories, with images from today up to the artist childhood and adolescence. They live in picture against the laws of time and space. Their selection and formation caused by ideas and poetic taste of artist only.

In paintings of Vitaly Tulenev color loses self-sustaining value, forming a kind of shaky aloof "environment", some picturesque equivalent of time, from which we can see images and symbols, folding in the texts and messages.

Vitaly Tulenev was a member of [[Saint Petersburg Union of Artists]] (before 1992 - the [[Leningrad branch of Union of Artists of Russian Federation]]) since 1964.&lt;ref&gt;''Directory of members of the Leningrad branch of Union of Artists of Russian Federation''. - Leningrad: Khudozhnik RSFSR, 1987. - p. 134.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the years of 1966&amp;ndash;1972 Vitaly Tulenev worked as Art Teacher in [[Repin Institute of Arts|Leningrad Institute of Painting, Sculpture and Architecture named after Ilya Repin]].

In 1984, Vitaly Tulenev was awarded the honorary title of [[Honored Artist of the RSFSR|Honored Artist of Russian Federation]].

Vitaly Ivanovich Tulenev died in Leningrad in 1998. Paintings by Vitaly Tulenev reside in [[State Russian Museum]], [[State Tretyakov Gallery]], in the lot of Art museums and private collections in Russia, China, England, Japan, USA, and throughout the world{{Citation needed|date=November 2010}}.
