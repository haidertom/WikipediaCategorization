The Aesthetic-Usability Effect describes a paradox that people perceive more [[aesthetic]] designs as much more intuitive, than those considered to be less aesthetically pleasing. The effect has been observed in several experiments and has significant implications regarding the acceptance, use, and performance of a design. Usability and aesthetics are the two most important factors in assessing the overall [[user experience]] for an application. [[Usability]] and [[aesthetics]] are judged by a user's reuse expectations, and then their post-use, or experienced, final judgement. A user's [[cognitive style]] can influence how they interact with and perceive an application, which in turn can influence their judgement of said application.

== History==
Masaaki Kurosu and Kaori Kashimura, researchers at Hitachi in Tokyo, demonstrated the aesthetic-usability effect in their study. The results of the analysis show that “the apparent usability is less correlated with the inherent usability compared to the apparent beauty. ... This suggests that the user may be strongly affected by the aesthetic aspect of the interface even when they try to evaluate the interface in its functional aspects, and it is suggested that the interface designers should strive not only to improve the inherent usability but also brush up the apparent usability or the aesthetic aspect of the interface.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Kurosu|first1=Masaaki|title=Apparent usability vs. inherent usability: experimental analysis on the determinants of the apparent usability|journal=CHI '95 Conference Companion on Human Factors in Computing Systems|pages=292–293}}&lt;/ref&gt; In other words, aesthetic usability effect play an important role in user experience.

== The aesthetics factor==
The aesthetics factor was manipulated by differing in terms of color combination, visual layout, and text font, which determine the level of aesthetics.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Lee|first=Sangwon|last2=Koubeka|first2=Richard J.|year=2011|title=The Impact of Cognitive Style on User Preference Based on Usability and Aesthetics for Computer-Based Systems|url=http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/10447318.2011.555320|journal=International Journal of Human–Computer Interaction|volume=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the study by Hall and Hanna, users perceived websites with white–black and black–white color combinations as less pleasing and stimulating than ones with non-grayscale color combinations. A few previous studies Kurosu &amp; Kashimura (1995) Tractinsky (1997) Tractinsky ( 2000) demonstrated a significant effect of visual layout on perceived aesthetics in experiments with Automated Teller Machine (ATM) layouts with different arrangements of content items.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Human-computer Interaction and Management Information Systems: Foundations|last=Zhang|first=Yahong|last2=Zhang|first2=Ping|last3=Galletta|first3=Dennis F.|publisher=Routledge, Taylor &amp; Francis Group|year=2006|isbn=978-0-7656-1486-5|location=New York|pages=|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In an experiment using home robotic control systems, Conklin (2006) showed that the manipulation of interface aesthetics with the use of color, layout, and font style was successful.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Conklin|first=S. M.|last2=Koubek|first2=R. J.|last3=Thurman|first3=J. A.|last4=Newman|first4=L. C.|year=2006|title=The effects of aesthetics and cognitive style on perceived usability.|url=|journal=Proceedings of the Human Factors and Ergonomics Society Annual Meeting|volume=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, McCracken and Wolfe (2004) recommended using of Georgia or Verdana font styles not intermixed in the body text of a website rather than Times New Roman or Arial intermixed in the body text.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=User-centered Website Development: A Human-computer Interaction Approach|last=McCracken|first=Daniel D.|last2=Jean Wolfe|first2=Rosalee|publisher=Prentice Hall|year=2004|isbn=9780130411617|location=|pages=|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== The effect of cognitive style==
Cognitive style is a characteristic of the user determined by the [[Cognitive styles analysis|Cognitive Styles Analysis (CSA)]].The interface and functional features of an application can be harmonized or non-harmonized in accordance with a user's cognitive style. Cognitive styles could be classified into two groups of people-imager and verbalizer, or [[Cognitive style#Multi-dimensional models and measures|the Wholist-Analytic and the Verbal-Imagery]] dimension. So an application success might vary, depending on how it caters to individual cognitive style. Imagers are more influenced by aesthetics factor and tends to utilize the aesthetics features in understanding and using an application. In 2011, Sangwon Lee and Richard J. Koubeks&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; showed results that the effect of aesthetics factor on pre-use preference was significantly different based on cognitive styles. There were significant differences in the pre-use preference of the changing aesthetics but not between the two types of cognitive styles of the test subjects. The same applied to the pre-use usability factor of the application as well. There was little difference in the effect of aesthetics on Wholist-Analytic versus Verbal-Imagery. This may be surprising considering that imagers think in pictures (visually), versus verbalizers who think in words. The effect of usability on the time performance was not significantly different between the two groups.

== Cultural aesthetics for user interface design==
Usability and aesthetics are two important factions for designing user interfaces. Thus, with the Internet being increasingly strong in the national marketplace, it is unreasonable to design a single common website for everyone and to expect it to attract the international audiences with the same aesthetic interface.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Reineche|first=Katharina|last2=Bernstein|first2=Abraham|year=2011|title=Improving Performance, Perceived Usability, and Aesthetics with Culturally Adaptive User Interface|url=http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=1970382|journal=ACM Transactions on Computer-Human Interaction (TOCHI)|volume=18|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; What users perceive as beautiful and usable strongly depends on their cultural background. Thus, the cultural aesthetics is a reasonable way to improve user interfaces and Cultural Adaptivity is a way to increase that. The idea is that websites automatically compose personalised interfaces based on the individual cultural backgrounds of its users; this is a deep understanding of the term culture.
There are several different factors of defining the user's cultural background, such as the user's first language, religion, the education level and the form of education and the social or political norm of the culture .&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Nisbett|first1=Richard|title=The Geography of Thought: How Asians and Westerners Think Differently...and Why|date=2003|publisher=Free Press|location=Now York|isbn=978-0743255356}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Sail|first1=Haytham|last2=M. Okeefe|first2=Robert|last3=S.Hone|first3=Kate|title=The impact of religious affiliation on trust in the context of electronic commerce. Interacting with Computers|date=February 2004|pages=7–27}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Salome|first1=Schmid-isler|title=Proceedings of the 33rd Annual Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences|date=5 January 2000|publisher=IEEE Computer Society|location=Los Alamitos, California, USA|isbn=0-7695-0493-0|url=https://www.alexandria.unisg.ch/11938/}}&lt;/ref&gt; All of those factors are very important aspects of defining the cultures of users and influencing the aesthetic direction of users.

== The influence of design aesthetics in usability testing==
Aesthetics designs are more effective at fostering positive attitudes than unaesthetic designs, and make people more tolerant of design problems. The design aesthetics is employed in two ways: it may refer to the objective features of a stimulus or to the subjective reaction to the specific product features.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Lidwell|first1=William|last2=Holden|first2=Kritina|last3=Butler|first3=Jill|title=Universal Principles of Design|date=2003|publisher=Rockport| isbn=9781592530076|url=https://books.google.com/books/about/Universal_Principles_of_Design.html?id=e4AaWB3QX6cC}}&lt;/ref&gt;
A study between two functionally identical mobile phones with highly appealing visual appearance not appealing visual appearance to determine the influence of appearance on perceived usability, performance measures and perceived attractiveness. The data confirmed that the aesthetically appealing prototype was rated significantly more attractive than the unappealing prototype. Furthermore, an interaction between prototype and product usage was found, showing an increase in the perceived attractiveness rating of the aesthetically appealing prototype after product usage whereas the attractiveness-rating of the unappealing prototype decreased after product usage. The main effect of product usage (before vs. after) was not significant. The results showed that participants using the highly appealing phone rated their appliance as being more usable than participants operating the unappealing model. Furthermore, the visual appearance of the phone had a positive effect on performance, leading to reduced task completion times for the attractive model.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|first1=Andreas|last1=Sonderegger|first2=Juergen|last2=Sauer|title=The influence of design aesthetics in usability testing: Effects on user performance and perceived usability|journal=Applied Ergonomics|date=2010|volume=4|issue=3|pages=403–410|url=https://scholar.google.com/citations?view_op=view_citation&amp;hl=en&amp;user=4DQsjnwAAAAJ&amp;citation_for_view=4DQsjnwAAAAJ:u5HHmVD_uO8C}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Aleppo Codex''' ({{lang-he|כֶּתֶר אֲרָם צוֹבָא}} '''''Keter Aram Tzova''''' or '''Crown of Aleppo''') is a medieval bound manuscript of the [[Hebrew Bible]]. The [[codex]] was written in the city of [[Tiberias]], in what is currently northern [[Israel]], in the 10th century C.E.,&lt;ref name="haaretz.com"&gt;[http://www.haaretz.com/hasen/spages/920915.html Fragment of ancient parchment given to Jewish scholars]&lt;/ref&gt; and was endorsed for its accuracy by [[Maimonides]]. Together with the [[Leningrad Codex]], it contains the [[Aaron ben Moses ben Asher|Ben-Asher]] [[Masoretic Text|masoretic]] tradition, but the Aleppo Codex lacks most of the Torah section and many other parts.

==History==

=== Overview ===
The [[Karaite Judaism|Karaite Jewish]] community of [[Jerusalem]] purchased the codex about a hundred years after it was made.&lt;ref&gt;[http://hebrewbooks.org/32847 M. Nehmad, ''Keter Aram Tzova'', Aleppo 1933]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Pfeffer|first1=Anshel|title=Fragment of Ancient Parchment From Bible Given to Jerusalem Scholars|url=http://www.haaretz.com/news/fragment-of-ancient-parchment-from-bible-given-to-jerusalem-scholars-1.232641|work=Haaretz|date=6 November 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the [[First Crusade]], the synagogue was plundered and the codex was transferred to Egypt, whose Jews paid a high price for its ransom.&lt;ref name="haaretz.com" /&gt; It was preserved at the [[Karaite Judaism|Karaite]] then [[Rabbinic Judaism|Rabbanite]] synagogue in [[Old Cairo]], where it was consulted by [[Maimonides]], who described it as a text trusted by all Jewish scholars. It is rumoured that in 1375 one of Maimonides' descendants brought it to [[Aleppo]], [[Syria]], leading to its present name.&lt;ref name="haaretz.com" /&gt;

The Codex remained in Syria for five hundred years. In 1947, rioters enraged by the [[United Nations Partition Plan for Palestine]] burned down the [[synagogue]] where it was kept.&lt;ref name="haaretz.com" /&gt; The Codex disappeared, then reemerged in 1958, when it was smuggled into [[Israel]] by [[Syrian Jews|Syrian Jew]] Murad Faham, and presented to the president of the state, [[Yitzhak Ben-Zvi]]. Some time after arrival, it was found that parts of the codex had been lost. The Aleppo Codex was entrusted to the Ben-Zvi Institute and [[Hebrew University of Jerusalem]]. It is currently (2005) on display in the [[Israel Museum]].

The Aleppo Codex was submitted by Israel for inclusion in UNESCO's [[Memory of the World]] Register and was included in 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Aleppo Codex | website=United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization | url=http://www.unesco.org/new/en/communication-and-information/memory-of-the-world/register/full-list-of-registered-heritage/registered-heritage-page-1/aleppo-codex/ | access-date=2018-10-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Karaite Jewish community of Jerusalem received the book from Israel ben Simha of [[Basra]] sometime between 1040 and 1050.&lt;ref name=judith&gt;[[Judith Olszowy-Schlanger|Olszowy-Schlanger, Judith]]. ''Karaite marriage documents from the Cairo Geniza: legal tradition and community life in mediaeval Egypt and Palestine.'' Etudes sur le judaïsme médiéval, t. 20. Leiden: Brill, 1998 ({{ISBN|9004108866}}), pg. 148&lt;/ref&gt; It was cared for by the brothers Hizkiyahu and Joshya, Karaite religious leaders who eventually moved to [[Fustat]] in 1050. The codex, however, stayed in Jerusalem until the latter part of that century.&lt;ref name=judith/&gt; After the [[Siege of Jerusalem (1099)]] during the [[First Crusade]], the Crusaders held the codex and other holy works for ransom (along with Jewish survivors).&lt;ref name=ols&gt;Olszowy: pp. 54-55 and footnote #86&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=codex&gt;[http://www.aleppocodex.org/10.html The Vicissitudes of the Aleppo Codex]&amp;nbsp;– See ''4.4 The Crusades and the Ransoming of Books''. Retrieved on 2008–03–04.&lt;/ref&gt; The Aleppo Codex website cites two letters in the [[Cairo Geniza]] that describe how the inhabitants of [[Ashkelon]] borrowed money from Egypt to pay for the books.&lt;ref name=codex/&gt; These [[Judeo-Arabic languages|Judeo-Arabic]] letters were discovered by noted Jewish historian [[Shelomo Dov Goitein]] in 1952.&lt;ref&gt;Kedar, Benjamin Z.

Ashgate Publishing Limited, 2004 ({{ISBN|075464099X}}), pg. 59&lt;/ref&gt; The ''[[Letter of the Karaite elders of Ascalon]]'', the more descriptive of the two, states that the money borrowed from [[Alexandria]] was used to “buy back two hundred and thirty Bible codices, a hundred other volumes, and eight Torah Scrolls."&lt;ref&gt;Goitein, S.D.

Yūsha’ b. Sha‘yā, who was in Ascalon for his wedding in early 1100.&lt;ref&gt;Goitein: pp. 375–376 and footnote #81 on pg. 612&lt;/ref&gt; Judeo-Arabic inscriptions on the first page of the Codex mention the book was then "transferred to the Jerusalemite synagogue in Fustat."&lt;ref name="ols" /&gt; The Aleppo codex website reveals how the book changed hands.
{{quote|[It was] transferred&amp;nbsp;[...] according to the law of redemption from imprisonment [in which it had fallen] in Jerusalem, the Holy City, may it be rebuilt and reestablished, to the congregation in Egypt of Knisat Yerushalayim, may it be built and established in the life of Israel. Blessed be he who preserves it and cursed be he who steals it, and cursed be he who sells it, and cursed be he who pawns it. It may not be sold and it may not be defiled forever.&lt;ref name=codex/&gt;}}

===In Aleppo===
The Aleppo community guarded the Codex zealously for some 600 years: it was kept, together with three other Biblical manuscripts, in a special cupboard (later, an iron safe) in a basement chapel of the [[Central Synagogue of Aleppo]], supposed to have been the [[Cave of Elijah]]. It was regarded as the community's most sacred possession: Those in trouble would pray before it, and oaths were taken by it. The community received queries from Jews around the world, who asked that various textual details be checked, correspondence which is preserved in the [[responsa]] literature, and which allows for the reconstruction of certain details in the parts that are missing today. Most importantly, in the 1850s, [[Shalom Shachne Yellin]] sent his son in law, Moses Joshua Kimchi, to Aleppo, to copy information about the Codex; Kimchi sat for weeks, and copied thousands of details about the codex into the margins of a small handwritten [[Bible]]. The existence of this Bible was known to 20th-century scholars from the book ''‘Ammudé Shesh'' by [[Shemuel Shelomo Boyarski]], and then the actual Bible itself was discovered by [[Yosef Ofer]] in 1989.

However, the community limited direct observation of the manuscript by outsiders, especially by scholars in modern times. [[Paul E. Kahle]], when revising the text of the ''[[Biblia Hebraica (Kittel)|Biblia Hebraica]]'' in the 1920s, tried and failed to obtain a photographic copy. This forced him to use the ''[[Leningrad Codex]]'' instead for the third edition, which appeared in 1937.

The only modern scholar allowed to compare it with a standard printed [[Hebrew Bible]] and take notes on the differences was [[Umberto Cassuto]], who examined it in 1943.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=A Wandering Bible: The Aleppo Codex|url=http://www.english.imjnet.org.il/page_1358|website=The Israel Museum, Jerusalem|accessdate=26 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; This secrecy made it impossible to confirm the authenticity of the Codex, and indeed Cassuto doubted that it was Maimonides' codex, though he agreed that it was 10th-century.

During the [[1947 Anti-Jewish riots in Aleppo]], the community's ancient synagogue was burned and the Codex was damaged. Later, after the Codex was in Israel, it was found that no more than 294 of the original (estimated) 487 pages survived.&lt;ref name=Pfeffer&gt;{{cite news | title = Fragment of Ancient Parchment From Bible Given to Jerusalem Scholars | author = Anshel Pfeffer | date = November 6, 2007 | url = https://www.haaretz.com/1.4995266}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hayim Tawil &amp; Bernard Schneider, ''Crown of Aleppo'' (Philadelphia, Jewish Publication Soc., 2010) page 110; there have been various reports and estimates of the original number of pages; Izhak Ben-Zvi, "The Codex of Ben Asher",  ''Textus,''  vol. 1 (1960) page 2, reprinted in Sid Z. Leiman, ed., ''The Canon and Masorah of the Hebrew Bible, an Introductory Reader'' (NY, [[KTAV Publishing House]], 1974) page 758 (estimating an original number of 380 pages).&lt;/ref&gt;  Each page is parchment, 33 cm high by 26.5 cm wide (13 inches x 10.43 inches).&lt;ref&gt;Hayim Tawil &amp; Bernard Schneider, ''Crown of Aleppo'' (Philadelphia, Jewish Publication Soc., 2010) page 110; Izhak Ben-Zvi, "The Codex of Ben Asher",  ''Textus,''  vol. 1 (1960) page 2, reprinted in Sid Z. Leiman, ed., ''The Canon and Masorah of the Hebrew Bible, an Introductory Reader''  (NY, Ktav Pubg. House, 1974) page 758.&lt;/ref&gt; In particular, only the last few pages of the [[Torah]] are extant.&lt;ref&gt;The surviving text begins with the last word of Deuteronomy 28:17; Izhak Ben-Zvi, "The Codex of Ben Asher",  ''Textus,''  vol. 1 (1960) page 2, reprinted in Sid Z. Leiman, ed., ''The Canon and Masorah of the Hebrew Bible, an Introductory Reader''  (NY, Ktav Pubg. House, 1974) page 758.&lt;/ref&gt;

The missing leaves are a subject of fierce controversy. Originally it was thought they were destroyed by fire, but scholarly analysis has shown no evidence of fire having reached the codex itself (the dark marks on the pages are due to fungus).&lt;ref name=Pfeffer/&gt; Some scholars instead accuse members of the Jewish community of having torn off the missing leaves and keeping them privately hidden. Two "missing" leaves have turned up, one in 1982 and the other in 2007, leaving open the possibility that even more may have survived the riots in 1947.&lt;ref name=holy&gt;{{cite news |author=[[Ronen Bergman]] |title=A High Holy Whodunit |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/07/29/magazine/the-aleppo-codex-mystery.html?pagewanted=all |quote= |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |date=July 25, 2012 |accessdate=2012-07-26 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  In particular, the 2012 book, ''The Aleppo Codex''  by [[Matti Friedman]], calls attention to the fact that eyewitnesses in Aleppo who saw the Codex shortly after the fire consistently reported that it was complete or nearly complete, and then there is no account of it for more than a decade, until after it arrived in Israel and was put in the Ben-Zvi Institute, at which point it was as currently described; his book suggests a number of possibilities for the loss of the pages including theft in Israel.&lt;ref&gt;Matti Friedman, ''The Aleppo Codex'' (Algonquin Books of Chapel Hill, 2012) chapt. 24 and ''passim''.&lt;/ref&gt;

The community of Damascus possessed a counterpart of the Aleppo Codex, known as the "Damascus Keter", also written in Israel in the 10th century, which is now kept at the [[National Library of Israel]] and numbered ms. Heb 5702. It is available online here [http://www.wdl.org/en/item/11364/]. (This should not be confused with another Damascus Keter, of medieval Spanish origin.)

===In Israel===
[[File:Jerusalem Schrein des Buches BW 1.JPG|thumb|right|Exterior view of the [[Shrine of the Book]]]]

In January 1958, the Aleppo Codex was smuggled out of Syria and sent to Jerusalem to be placed in the care of the chief rabbi of the Aleppo Jews.&lt;ref name=friedman2&gt;{{cite journal | author = Matti Friedman | title = The Continuing Mysteries of the Aleppo Codex | journal = [[Tablet (magazine)|Tablet]] | date = June 30, 2014 | url = http://www.tabletmag.com/jewish-arts-and-culture/books/176903/aleppo-codex}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was given first to [[Shlomo Zalman Shragai]] of the [[Jewish Agency]], who later testified that the Codex was complete or nearly so at the time.&lt;ref name=friedman2/&gt; Later it was given to the [[Yad Ben Zvi|Ben-Zvi Institute]].&lt;ref name=friedman2/&gt; In 1958, the Jewish community of Aleppo sued the Ben-Zvi Institute for the return of the Codex, but the court ruled against them and suppressed publication of the proceedings.&lt;ref name=friedman2/&gt;

In the late 1980s, the codex was placed in the [[Shrine of the Book]] at the [[Israel Museum]].&lt;ref name=holy /&gt; This finally gave scholars the chance to examine it and consider the claims that it is indeed the manuscript referred to by Maimonides. The work of [[Moshe Goshen-Gottstein]] on the few surviving pages of the Torah seems to have confirmed these claims beyond reasonable doubt. Goshen-Gottstein suggested (in the introduction to his facsimile reprint of the codex) that not only was it the oldest known masoretic Bible in a single volume, it was the first time ever that a complete ''[[Tanakh]]'' had been produced by one or two people as a unified entity in a consistent style.

Later, after the university denied him access to the codex, [[Mordechai Breuer]] began his own reconstruction of the Masoretic text on the basis of other well-known ancient manuscripts. His results matched the Aleppo Codex almost exactly. Thus today, Breuer's version is used authoritatively for the reconstruction of the missing portions of the Aleppo Codex. The ''[[Jerusalem Crown]]'' (כתר ירושלים, "Jerusalem Crown"), printed in Jerusalem in 2000, is a modern version of the Tanakh based on the Aleppo Codex and the work of Breuer: It uses a newly designed typeface based on the calligraphy of the Codex and is based on its page layout.{{citation needed|date=May 2016}}

[[Documentary film]]maker, Avi Dabach, great grandson of Chacham Ezra Dabach (one of the last caretakers of the Codex when it was still in Syria), announced in December 2015 an upcoming film tracing the history of the Codex and possibly determining the fate of the missing pages.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Maltz|first1=Judy|title=My Great-grandfather, the Man Who Held the Key to the Aleppo Codex|url=http://www.haaretz.com/israel-news/.premium-1.693328|website=Haaretz|accessdate=24 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Authoritative text==
The consonants in the codex were copied by the scribe Shlomo ben Buya'a in Israel circa 920. The text was then verified, vocalized, and provided with Masoretic notes by [[Aaron ben Moses ben Asher]], the last and most prominent member of the ben Asher dynasty of grammarians from [[Tiberias]], rivals to the [[ben Naphtali]] school. The tradition of ben Asher has become the one accepted for the [[Hebrew Bible]].&lt;ref name="ej2-ben-asher"&gt;{{citation | author=Zeev Ben-Hayyim | contribution=BEN-ASHER, AARON BEN MOSES | title=[[Encyclopaedia Judaica]] | edition=2nd | volume=3 | year=2007 | publisher=Gale | pages=319–321}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ben Asher vocalization is late and in many respects artificial, compared to other traditions and tendencies reaching back closer to the period of spoken Biblical Hebrew.&lt;ref name="nce2-bible"&gt;{{citation | author=P. W. Skehan | contribution=BIBLE (TEXTS) | title=[[New Catholic Encyclopedia]] | edition=2nd | volume=2 | publisher=Gale | year=2003 | pages=355–362}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''[[Leningrad Codex]]'', which dates to approximately the same time as the Aleppo codex, has been claimed by Paul E. Kahle to be a product of the ben Asher [[scriptorium]]. However, its [[Colophon (publishing)|colophon]] says only that it was corrected from manuscripts written by ben Asher; there is no evidence that ben Asher himself ever saw it. However, the same holds true for the Aleppo Codex, which was apparently not vocalized by ben Asher himself, although a later colophon, which was added to the manuscript after his death, attributes the vocalization to him.&lt;ref name="ej2-masorah"&gt;{{citation | author=[[Aron Dotan]] | contribution=MASORAH | title=[[Encyclopaedia Judaica]] | edition=2nd | volume=13 | year=2007 | publisher=Gale | pages=603–656}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Aleppo Codex was the manuscript used by Maimonides when he set down the exact rules for writing scrolls of the [[Torah]], ''Hilkhot [[Sefer Torah]]'' ("the Laws of the Torah Scroll") in his ''[[Mishneh Torah]]''.&lt;ref name=codex/&gt; This [[halakha|halachic]] ruling gave the Aleppo Codex the seal of supreme textual authority, albeit only with regard to the type of space preceding sections (''petuhot'' and ''setumot'') and for the manner of the writing of the songs in the Pentateuch.&lt;ref name="ej2-masorah" /&gt; "The codex which we used in these works is the codex known in [[Egypt]], which includes 24 books, which was in [[Jerusalem]]," he wrote. [[David ben Solomon ibn Abi Zimra]] testifies to this being the same codex that was later transferred to Aleppo.{{citation needed|date=May 2016}}

==Contents==
When the Aleppo Codex was complete (until 1947), it followed the Tiberian textual tradition in the order of its books, similar to the ''[[Leningrad Codex]]'', and which also matches the later tradition of [[Sephardi Jews|Sephardi]] biblical manuscripts. The [[Torah]] and the [[Nevi'im]] appear in the same order found in most printed Hebrew Bibles, but the order for the books for [[Ketuvim]] differs markedly. In the Aleppo Codex, the order of the Ketuvim is [[Books of Chronicles]], [[Psalms]], [[Book of Job]], [[Book of Proverbs]], [[Book of Ruth]], [[Song of Songs]], [[Ecclesiastes]], [[Book of Lamentations]], [[Book of Esther]], [[Book of Daniel]], and [[Book of Ezra]] and [[Book of Nehemiah]].

The current text is missing all of the [[Torah#Pentateuch|Pentateuch]] to the [[Book of Deuteronomy]] 28.17; [[Books of Kings|II Kings]] 14.21–18.13; [[Book of Jeremiah]] 29.9–31.33; 32.2–4, 9–11, 21–24; [[Book of Amos]] 8.12–[[Book of Micah]] 5.1; So 3.20–Za 9.17; II Chronicles 26.19–35.7; Book of Psalms 15.1–25.2 (MT enumeration); Song of Songs 3.11 to the end; all of Ecclesiastes, Lamentations, Esther, Daniel, and Ezra-Nehemiah.&lt;ref name="nce2-bible" /&gt;

== Modern editions ==
Several complete or partial editions of the [[Tanakh]] based on the Aleppo Codex have been published over the past three decades in Israel, some of them under the academic auspices of Israeli universities. These editions incorporate reconstructions of the missing parts of the codex based on the methodology of [[Mordechai Breuer]] or similar systems, and by taking into account all available historical testimony about the contents of the codex.

'''Complete Tanakh:'''
These are complete editions of the [[Tanakh]], usually in one volume (but sometimes also sold in three volumes). They do ''not'' include the masoretic notes of the Aleppo Codex.
# [[Mossad Harav Kook]] edition, [[Mordechai Breuer]], ed. [[Torah]] (1977); [[Nebi'im]] (1979); [[Ketubim]] (1982); full [[Tanakh]] in one volume 1989. This was the first edition to include a reconstruction of the letters, vowels, and cantillation marks in the missing parts of the Aleppo codex.
# Horev publishers, Jerusalem, 1996–98. [[Mordechai Breuer]], ed. This was the first edition to incorporate newly discovered information on the [[parashah]] divisions of the Aleppo Codex for [[Nebi'im]] and [[Ketubim]]. The text of the Horev Tanakh has been reprinted in several forms with various commentaries by the same publisher.&lt;ref name="Taj"&gt;In this edition, the masoretic text and symbols were encoded and graphic layout was enabled by the computer program ''Taj'', developed by Daniel Weissman.&lt;/ref&gt;
# ''[[Jerusalem Crown]]: The Bible of the Hebrew University of Jerusalem'', 2000. Edited according to the method of [[Mordechai Breuer]] under the supervision of Yosef Ofer, with additional proofreading and refinements since the Horev edition.&lt;ref name="Taj" /&gt;
# Jerusalem Simanim Institute, Feldheim Publishers, 2004 (published in one-volume and three-volume editions).&lt;ref name="Taj" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"After consultation... with the greatest Torah scholars and grammarians, the biblical text in this edition was chosen to conform with the Aleppo Codex which as is well known was corrected by [[Aaron ben Moses ben Asher|Ben-Asher]]... Where this manuscript is not extant we have relied on the [[Leningrad Codex]]... Similarly the open and closed [[parashah|sections]] that are missing in the Aleppo Codex have been completed according to the biblical list compiled by Rabbi Shalom Shachna Yelin that were published in the Jubilee volume for Rabbi Breuer... (translated from the Hebrew on p. 12 of the introduction).&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Complete online Tanakh:'''
* Mechon Mamre provides an online edition of the [[Tanakh]] based upon the Aleppo Codex and related Tiberian manuscripts. Its reconstruction of the missing text is based on the methods of Mordechai Breuer. The text is offered in four formats: (a) Masoretic letter-text, (b) "full" letter-text (unrelated to masoretic spelling), (c) masoretic text with vowels ([[niqqud]]), and (d) masoretic text with vowels and [[cantillation]] signs. See [[#External links|external links]] below.
* '''[[:s:he:משתמש:Dovi/מקרא על פי המסורה|"Miqra according to the Mesorah"]]''' is an experimental, digital version of the Tanakh based on the Aleppo Codex with full documentation of the editorial policy and its implementation ([[:s:User:Dovi/Miqra according to the Mesorah|English-language abstract]]).

'''Partial editions:'''
* [[Hebrew University Bible Project]] (Isaiah, Jeremiah, Ezekiel). Includes the masoretic notes of the Aleppo Codex.
* [[Mikraot Gedolot]] Haketer, [[Bar-Ilan University]] (1992–present). A multi-volume critical edition of the [[Mikraot Gedolot]], sixteen volumes published to date including Genesis (2 vols.), Exodus (2 vols.), Numbers, Deuteronomy, Joshua &amp; Judges (1 vol.), Samuel, Kings, Isaiah, Jeremiah, Ezekiel, Minor Prophets, Psalms (2 vols.), Five Megillot (1 vol.), Chronicles. Includes the masoretic notes of the Aleppo Codex and a new commentary on them. Differs from the Breuer reconstruction and presentation for some masoretic details.
* Torat Hayim, published by Mossad ha-Rav Kook (Torah, Proverbs, and Five Megillot).
* Chorev Mikraot Gedolot by Hotzaat Chorev (Torah only).

An '''algal bloom''' or '''algae bloom''' is a rapid increase or accumulation in the population of [[algae]] in freshwater or marine water systems, and is recognized by the discoloration in the water from their pigments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Ferris |first=Robert |date=July 26, 2016 |title=Why are there so many toxic algae blooms this year |url=https://www.cnbc.com/2016/07/26/why-are-there-so-many-toxic-algae-blooms-this-year.html |newspaper=[[CNBC]] |access-date=July 27, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Cyanobacteria]] were mistaken for algae in the past, so cyanobacterial blooms are sometimes also called algal blooms. Blooms which can injure animals or the ecology are called "[[harmful algal blooms]]" (HAB), and can lead to fish die-offs, cities cutting off water to residents, or states having to close fisheries.

== Blooming ==
[[Image:River algae Sichuan.jpg|thumb|Algal blooms can present problems for [[ecosystem]]s and human society.]]
Since 'algae' is a broad term including organisms of widely varying sizes, growth rates and nutrient requirements, there is no officially recognized threshold level as to what is defined as a bloom. For some species, algae can be considered to be blooming at concentrations reaching millions of cells per milliliter, while others form blooms of tens of thousands of cells per liter. The photosynthetic pigments in the algal cells determine the color of the algal bloom, and are thus often a greenish color, but they can also be a wide variety of other colors such as yellow, brown or red, depending on the species of algae and the type of pigments contained therein.

Bright green blooms in freshwater systems are frequently a result of [[cyanobacteria]] (colloquially known as "blue-green algae" as a result of their confusing taxonomical history) such as ''[[Microcystis aeruginosa|Microcystis]]''. Blooms may also consist of [[macroalgal]] (non-[[phytoplanktonic]]) species. These blooms are recognizable by large blades of algae that may wash up onto the shoreline.

Of particular note are the rare '''harmful algal blooms''' (HABs), which are algal bloom events involving toxic or otherwise harmful phytoplankton such as [[dinoflagellate]]s of the [[genus]] ''Alexandrium'' and ''Karenia'', or [[diatoms]] of the genus ''[[Pseudo-nitzschia]]''. Such blooms often take on a red or brown hue and are known colloquially as '''[[red tide]]s'''.

==Freshwater algal blooms==
{{Further|Nutrient pollution|Eutrophication}}
Freshwater algal blooms are the result of an [[Nutrient pollution|excess of nutrients]], particularly some [[phosphate]]s.&lt;ref name="Phytoplankton Blooms: The Basics"&gt;{{cite web|last=Diersling|first=Nancy|title=Phytoplankton Blooms: The Basics|url=http://floridakeys.noaa.gov/scisummaries/wqpb.pdf|publisher=NOAA FKNMS|accessdate=26 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Lake Scientist"&gt;{{cite web|last=Hochanadel|first=Dave|title=Limited amount of total phosphorus actually feeds algae, study finds|url=http://www.lakescientist.com/2010/limited-amount-of-total-phosphorus-actually-feeds-algae-study-finds|publisher=Lake Scientist|accessdate=10 June 2012|date=10 December 2010|quote=[B]ioavailable phosphorus – phosphorus that can be utilized by plants and bacteria – is only a fraction of the total, according to Michael Brett, a UW engineering professor ...}}&lt;/ref&gt; The excess of nutrients may originate from fertilizers that are applied to land for agricultural or recreational purposes. They may also originate from household cleaning products containing [[phosphorus]].&lt;ref name="pmid249679"&gt;{{Cite journal

Presence of [[Residual Sodium Carbonate Index|residual sodium carbonate]] acts as catalyst for the algae to bloom by providing dissolved carbon dioxide for enhanced photosynthesis in the presence of nutrients.

When phosphates are introduced into water systems, higher concentrations cause increased growth of algae and plants. Algae tend to grow very quickly under high nutrient availability, but each algal is short-lived, and the result is a high concentration of dead organic matter which starts to decay. The decay process consumes dissolved oxygen in the water, resulting in [[Hypoxia (environmental)|hypoxic]] conditions. Without sufficient dissolved oxygen in the water, animals and plants may [[Dead zone (ecology)|die off]] in large numbers. Use of an [[Olszewski tube]] can help combat these problems with hypolimnetic withdrawal.

Blooms may be observed in [[freshwater aquarium]]s when fish are overfed and excess nutrients are not absorbed by plants. These are generally harmful for fish, and the situation can be corrected by changing the water in the tank and then reducing the amount of food given.

==Harmful algal blooms==
{{main|Harmful algal blooms}}

[[File:Van Gogh from Space.jpg|thumb|right|Satellite image of [[phytoplankton]] swirling around the [[Sweden|Swedish]] island of [[Gotland]] in the [[Baltic Sea]], in 2005]]

A ''harmful algal bloom'' (HAB) is an algal bloom that causes negative impacts to other organisms via production of natural toxins, mechanical damage to other organisms, or by other means. HABs are often associated with large-scale marine mortality events and have been associated with various types of [[shellfish poisoning]]s.&lt;ref&gt;

In studies at the population level bloom coverage has been significantly related to the risk of non-alcoholic [[liver disease]] death.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title=Cyanobacteria blooms and non-alcoholic liver disease: evidence from a county level ecological study in the United States | journal=Environ Health | date=2015 |author1=Feng Zhang |author2=Jiyoung Lee |author3=Song Liang |author4=CK Shum | pmc=4428243 | pmid=25948281 | doi=10.1186/s12940-015-0026-7 | volume=14 | page=41}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Background===
In the marine environment, single-celled, microscopic, plant-like organisms naturally occur in the well-lit surface layer of any body of water. These organisms, referred to as [[phytoplankton]] or microalgae, form the base of the food web upon which nearly all other marine organisms depend. Of the 5000+ species of marine phytoplankton that exist worldwide, about 2% are known to be harmful or toxic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Landsberg |first=J. H. |year=2002 |title=The effects of harmful algal blooms on aquatic organisms |journal=Reviews in Fisheries Science |volume=10 |issue=2 |pages=113–390 |doi=10.1080/20026491051695 |pmid= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Blooms of harmful algae can have large and varied impacts on marine ecosystems, depending on the species involved, the environment where they are found, and the mechanism by which they exert negative effects.

Harmful algal blooms have been observed to cause adverse effects to a wide variety of aquatic organisms, most notably marine mammals, sea turtles, seabirds and finfish. The impacts of HAB toxins on these groups can include harmful changes to their developmental, immunological, neurological, or reproductive capacities.  The most conspicuous effects of HABs on marine wildlife are large-scale mortality events associated with toxin-producing blooms. For example, a [[mass mortality event]] of 107 [[bottlenose dolphins]] occurred along the Florida panhandle in the spring of 2004 due to ingestion of contaminated [[menhaden]] with high levels of [[brevetoxin]].&lt;ref name="Flewelling LJ 2005"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Flewelling |first=L. J. |year=2005 |title=Red tides and marine mammal mortalities |journal=[[Nature (journal)|Nature]] |volume=435 |issue=7043 |pages=755–756 |doi=10.1038/nature435755a |pmid= 15944690|pmc=2659475 |display-authors=etal|bibcode = 2005Natur.435..755F }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Manatee mortalities have also been attributed to brevetoxin but unlike dolphins, the main toxin vector was endemic seagrass species (''Thalassia testudinum'') in which high concentrations of brevetoxins were detected and subsequently found as a main component of the stomach contents of manatees.&lt;ref name="Flewelling LJ 2005"/&gt;

Additional marine mammal species, like the highly endangered [[North Atlantic Right Whale]], have been exposed to neurotoxins by preying on highly contaminated [[zooplankton]].&lt;ref name="Durbin E 2002"&gt;Durbin E ''et al'' (2002) North Atlantic right whale, ''Eubalaena glacialis'', exposed to paralytic shellfish poisoning (PSP) toxins via a zooplankton vector, ''Calanus finmarchicus''. Harmful Algae I, : 243-251 (2002)&lt;/ref&gt;  With the summertime habitat of this species overlapping with seasonal blooms of the toxic dinoflagellate ''Alexandrium fundyense'', and subsequent copepod grazing, foraging right whales will ingest large concentrations of these contaminated [[copepods]].  Ingestion of such contaminated prey can affect respiratory capabilities, feeding behavior, and ultimately the reproductive condition of the population.&lt;ref name="Durbin E 2002"/&gt;

Immune system responses have been affected by brevetoxin exposure in another critically endangered species, the [[Loggerhead sea turtle]].  Brevetoxin exposure, via inhalation of aerosolized toxins and ingestion of contaminated prey, can have clinical signs of increased lethargy and muscle weakness in loggerhead sea turtles causing these animals to wash ashore in a decreased metabolic state with increases of immune system responses upon blood analysis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Walsh |first=C. J. |year=2010 |title=Effects of brevetoxin exposure on the immune system of loggerhead sea turtles |journal=Aquatic Toxicology |volume=97 |issue=4 |pages=293–303 |doi=10.1016/j.aquatox.2009.12.014 |pmid= 20060602|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Examples of common harmful effects of HABs include:
#the production of neurotoxins which cause mass mortalities in fish, seabirds, sea turtles, and marine mammals

HABs occur in many regions of the world, and in the United States are recurring phenomena in multiple geographical regions.  The [[Gulf of Maine]] frequently experiences blooms of the [[dinoflagellate]] ''[[Alexandrium fundyense]]'', an organism that produces [[saxitoxin]], the neurotoxin responsible for [[paralytic shellfish poisoning]].  The well-known "Florida red tide" that occurs in the Gulf of Mexico is a HAB caused by ''[[Karenia brevis]]'', another dinoflagellate which produces brevetoxin, the neurotoxin responsible for [[neurotoxic shellfish poisoning]]. California coastal waters also experience seasonal blooms of ''[[Pseudo-nitzschia]]'', a [[diatom]] known to produce [[domoic acid]], the neurotoxin responsible for [[amnesic shellfish poisoning]]. Off the west coast of [[South Africa]], HABs caused by ''[[Alexandrium catanella]]'' occur every spring. These blooms of organisms cause severe disruptions in [[fishery|fisheries]] of these waters as the toxins in the phytoplankton cause filter-feeding [[shellfish]] in affected waters to become poisonous for human consumption.&lt;ref&gt;

If the HAB event results in a high enough concentration of algae the water may become discoloured or murky, varying in colour from purple to almost pink, normally being red or green. Not all algal blooms are dense enough to cause water discolouration.

===Red tides===
[[File:Maré vermelha.JPG|thumb|A red tide]]
{{main|Red tide}}

''[[Red tide]]'' is a term often used synonymously with HABs in marine coastal areas; however, the term is misleading since algal blooms can widely vary in color, and growth of algae is unrelated to the [[tide]]s. The term ''algal bloom'' or ''harmful algal bloom'' has since replaced ''red tide'' as the appropriate description of this phenomenon.

===Causes of HABs===
It is unclear what causes HABs; their occurrence in some locations appears to be entirely natural,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Adams |first=N. G. |last2=Lesoing |first2=M. |last3=Trainer |first3=V. L. |year=2000 |title=Environmental conditions associated with domoic acid in razor clams on the Washington coast |journal=J Shellfish Res |volume=19 |issue= |pages=1007–1015 |doi= |pmid= }}&lt;/ref&gt; while in others they appear to be a result of human activities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Lam |first=C. W. Y. |last2=Ho |first2=K. C. |year=1989 |chapter=Red tides in Tolo Harbor, Hong Kong |editor-last=Okaichi |editor-first=T. |editor2-last=Anderson |editor2-first=D.

The frequency and severity of HABs in some parts of the world have been linked to increased nutrient loading from human activities. In other areas, HABs are a predictable seasonal occurrence resulting from coastal upwelling, a natural result of the movement of certain ocean currents.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Trainer |first=V. L. |last2=Adams |first2=N. G. |last3=Bill |first3=B. D. |last4=Stehr |first4=C. M. |last5=Wekell |first5=J.

The type of nitrates and phosphates available in the system are also a factor, since phytoplankton can grow at different rates depending on the relative abundance of these substances (e.g. [[ammonia]], [[urea]], nitrate ion). A variety of other nutrient sources can also play an important role in affecting algal bloom formation, including iron, silica or carbon.  Coastal [[water pollution]] produced by humans (including iron fertilization) and systematic increase in [[global warming|sea water temperature]] have also been suggested as possible contributing factors in HABs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Moore |first=S. |year=2011 |title=Impacts of climate variability and future climate change on harmful algal blooms and human health |work=Proceedings of the Centers for Oceans and Human Health Investigators Meeting |doi=10.1186/1476-069X-7-S2-S4 |display-authors=etal |volume=7 |pages=S4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other factors such as iron-rich dust influx from large desert areas such as the [[Sahara]] are thought to play a role in causing HABs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Walsh |year=2006 |title=Red tides in the Gulf of Mexico: Where, when, and why? |journal=Journal of Geophysical Research |volume=111 |issue= |pages=C11003 |doi=10.1029/2004JC002813 |bibcode=2006JGRC..11111003W|display-authors=etal|pmc=2856968}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some algal blooms on the [[Pacific coast]] have also been linked to natural occurrences of large-scale climatic oscillations such as [[El Niño]] events. HABs are also linked to heavy rainfall.&lt;ref name="Morse 1006–1025"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Morse|first=Ryan E.|last2=Shen|first2=Jian|last3=Blanco-Garcia|first3=Jose L.|last4=Hunley|first4=William S.|last5=Fentress|first5=Scott|last6=Wiggins|first6=Mike|last7=Mulholland|first7=Margaret R.|date=2011-09-01|title=Environmental and Physical Controls on the Formation and Transport of Blooms of the Dinoflagellate Cochlodinium polykrikoides Margalef in the Lower Chesapeake Bay and Its Tributaries|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s12237-011-9398-2|journal=Estuaries and Coasts|language=en|volume=34|issue=5|pages=1006–1025|doi=10.1007/s12237-011-9398-2|issn=1559-2723}}&lt;/ref&gt; While HABs in the Gulf of Mexico have been occurring since the time of early explorers such as [[Cabeza de Vaca]],&lt;ref&gt;Cabeza de Vaca, Álvar Núnez. La Relación (1542). Translated by Martin A. dunsworth
 and José B. Fernández. Arte Público Press, Houston, Texas (1993)&lt;/ref&gt; it is unclear what initiates these blooms and how large a role [[human impact on the environment|anthropogenic]] and natural factors play in their development. It is also unclear whether the apparent increase in frequency and severity of HABs in various parts of the world is in fact a real increase or is due to increased observation effort and advances in species identification technology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt; However recent research found that the warming of summer surface temperatures of lakes, which rose by 0.34&amp;nbsp;°C decade per decade between 1985 and 2009 due to [[global warming]], also will likely increase algal blooming by 20% over the next century.&lt;ref&gt;O'Reiley et al, ''Rapid and highly variable warming of lake surface waters around the globe''.

===Researching solutions===
The decline of filter-feeding shellfish populations, such as [[oysters]], likely contribute to HAB occurrence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Brumbaugh, R.D. et al.|date=2006|title=A Practitioners Guide to the Design &amp; Monitoring of Shellfish Restoration Projects: An Ecosystem Approach.

Since many algal blooms are caused by a major influx of nutrient-rich runoff into a water body, programs to treat wastewater, reduce the overuse of fertilizers in agriculture and reducing the bulk flow of runoff can be effective for reducing severe algal blooms at river mouths, [[estuary|estuaries]], and the ocean directly in front of the river's mouth.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2526">'''Amodal perception''' is the [[perception]] of the whole of a physical structure when only parts of it affect the sensory receptors. For example, a table will be perceived as a complete volumetric structure even if only part of it—the facing surface—projects to the retina; it is perceived as possessing internal volume and hidden rear surfaces despite the fact that only the near surfaces are exposed to view. Similarly, the world around us is perceived as a surrounding plenum, even though only part of it is in view at any time. Another much quoted example is that of the "dog behind a picket fence" in which a long narrow object (the dog) is partially occluded by fence-posts in front of it, but is nevertheless perceived as a single continuous object. Albert Bregman noted an auditory analogue of this phenomenon: when a melody is interrupted by bursts of white noise, it is nonetheless heard as a single melody continuing "behind" the bursts of noise.

Formulation of the theory is credited to the [[Belgian]] psychologist [[Albert Michotte]] and [[Fabio Metelli]], an [[Italian people|Italian]] psychologist, with their work developed in recent years by [[E.S. Reed]] and the [[Gestalt psychology|Gestaltists]].

Modal completion is a similar phenomenon in which a shape is perceived to be occluding other shapes even when the shape itself is not drawn. Examples include the triangle that appears to be occluding three disks and an outlined triangle in the [[Kanizsa triangle]] and the circles and squares that appear in different versions of the [[Koffka cross]].

The '''axillary lines''' are the anterior axillary line, midaxillary line and the posterior axillary line.

The '''anterior axillary line''' &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Logan, Carolynn M.|author2=Rice, M. Katherine|title=Logan's Medical and Scientific Abbreviations|date=1987|publisher=[[J. B. Lippincott Company]]|location=Philadelphia|isbn=0-397-54589-4|page=3|ref=logansaabrev}}&lt;/ref&gt;
is a [[Coronal plane|coronal]] line on the anterior torso marked by the [[anterior axillary fold]]. It's the imaginary line that runs down from the point midway between the middle of the [[clavicle]] and the lateral end of the clavicle; the lateral end of the collarbone is the end closer to the arm.

The V&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt; [[ECG]] lead is placed on the anterior axillary line, horizontally even with V&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;.

The '''midaxillary line''' is a coronal line on the torso between the anterior and posterior axillary lines.

It is a landmark used in [[thoracentesis]],&lt;ref name="Light2007"&gt;{{cite book|author=Richard W. Light|title=Pleural diseases|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vHEpRHQXaKUC&amp;pg=PA376|accessdate=4 November 2010|date=1 April 2007|publisher=Lippincott Williams &amp; Wilkins|isbn=978-0-7817-6957-0|pages=376–}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the V6 electrode of the 10 electrode ECG.

The '''posterior axillary line''' is a coronal line on the posterior torso marked by the [[posterior axillary fold]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5603">The '''[[MIT]] Center for Civic Media''' (formerly the '''Center for Future Civic Media''') is a research and practical center that develops and implements tools that support political action and "the information needs of [civic] communities".&lt;ref&gt;From http://civic.mit.edu/about, retrieved June 26, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; Its mission reads in part:

:The MIT Center for Civic Media creates and deploys technical and social tools that fill the information needs of communities.

:We are inventors of new technologies that support and foster [[civic media]]&lt;ref&gt;According to the center's website: "Civic media is any form of communication that strengthens the social bonds within a community or creates a strong sense of [[civic engagement]] among its residents." [http://civic.mit.edu/about CCM homepage]. Retrieved 2011-09-12&lt;/ref&gt; and political action; we are a hub for the study of these technologies; and we coordinate community-based test beds both in the United States and internationally.&lt;ref&gt;From http://civic.mit.edu/about, retrieved June 29, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The Center for Civic Media was founded in 2007 as a joint effort of the [[MIT Media Lab]] and the MIT Comparative Media Studies program. Its initial funding, a four-year grant from the [[Knight Foundation]], was won in a contest "to foster blogs and other digital efforts that seek to bring together residents of a city or town in ways that local newspapers historically have done." The founders planned to "develop new technologies and practices to help newspapers attract readers as a greater number of Americans use the Internet as their primary news source."&lt;ref&gt;"Knight Foundation Awards $12-Million for Digital News Projects." Chronicle of Philanthropy, 31 May 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;See the original [http://civic.mit.edu/sites/civic.mit.edu/files/C4-Knight-foundation-proposal.pdf proposal], hosted at civic.mit.edu.  Retrieved June 26, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; It expanded in 2011.

Staffed by academic, technical, and professional staff, the Center was originally led by [[Christopher Csikszentmihályi]], along with the Media Lab's [[Mitchel Resnick]] and Comparative Media Studies' [[Henry Jenkins]]. [[Ethan Zuckerman]] was announced as the Center's new director in June 2011.&lt;ref&gt;[http://web.mit.edu/newsoffice/2011/zuckerman-civic-media.html MIT News Office report] on the center and its annual [[Civic Media Conference]].&lt;/ref&gt;  Others affiliated with the center include [[Sasha Costanza-Chock]], [[Benjamin Mako Hill]], [[William Uricchio]], [[Jing Wang (professor)|Jing Wang]], and [[Jeffrey Warren]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://civic.mit.edu/team Center for Civic Media team].

== Research and development ==
[[File:Port Sulphur, Wilkinson Bay, East.jpg|thumb|An example of Grassroots Mapping's balloon-and-camera imagery, taken in the Gulf of Mexico immediately after the B.P. Oil Spill.]] The Center creates tools for deployment and testing in geographic communities. Like the Media Lab, the work is iterative, experimental, and draws in large part on the work of current graduate students. But unlike much other work at the Media Lab, Center tools are expected to have immediate applications, even if narrowly focused on a specific community's need.

With varying levels of adoption, deployed civic media tools and communities have included:
* [http://grassrootsmapping.org Grassroots Mapping] (Gulf of Mexico oil spill; the Gowanus Canal, Brooklyn, Superfund site), a collection of cartographic tools and practices—such as best practices for using balloons, kites, inexpensive cameras, and open-source software—for citizens to produce their own aerial imagery. Grassroots Mapping grew into the larger [http://publiclaboratory.org Public Laboratory for Open Technology and Science], which won a [http://www.knightfoundation.org/grants/20110151/ $500,000 Knight News Challenge grant] for its work.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10627">The '''Centre for Social Cohesion''' (CSC) was a British [[think tank]] with its headquarters in London. Founded in 2007 as part of another London think tank, [[Civitas (think tank)|Civitas]], it became independent in 2008 and was eventually subsumed into a separate London think tank, the [[Henry Jackson Society]], in April 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Isaby|first=Jonathan|title=Douglas Murray and staff from the Centre for Social Cohesion join the Henry Jackson Society|url=http://conservativehome.blogs.com/thinktankcentral/2011/04/douglas-murray-and-staff-from-the-centre-for-social-cohesion-join-the-henry-jackson-society.html|publisher=Conservative Home|accessdate=31 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Foundation and constitution==
CSC was established with funding of circa £275,000&lt;ref name="CivitasFunds"&gt;[http://www.civitas.org.uk/pdf/AuditedAccounts2007.pdf Civitas Ltd Audited Accounts and Financial Statement for the year ending 31 December 2007] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090626011238/http://www.civitas.org.uk/pdf/AuditedAccounts2007.pdf |date=June 26, 2009 }} (see pg. 8). Accessed 19 January 2009&lt;/ref&gt; from [[Civitas (think tank)|Civitas]]. The organisation was constituted as a company limited by guarantee. It was incorporated and registered with [[Companies House]] in June 2008.&lt;ref name="CHInfo"&gt;[http://wck2.companieshouse.gov.uk/c2579b88aede2a617592dff4fbce0b67/compdetails Companies House records relating to the Centre for Social Cohesion] Accessed 19 February 2009&lt;/ref&gt; Companies House records indicate that, as of 5 January 2009, the company's [[Board of directors|directors]] were [[Caroline Cox, Baroness Cox|Baroness Cox]], former Professor of the private [[University of Buckingham]], Dr John Marks,&lt;ref name="UBuck"&gt;[http://www.buckingham.ac.uk/publicity/aboutbuck/inthenews/mpu0806.html#staff University of Buckingham in the news June 2008 update.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090204155258/http://buckingham.ac.uk/publicity/aboutbuck/inthenews/mpu0806.html |date=2009-02-04 }} Accessed 25 February 2009

CSC shared its Clutha House premises in London with The Pilgrim Trust, Civitas, and Policy Exchange.&lt;ref name="CluthaInfo"&gt;[http://www.keningtons.com/index.asp?PageID=400 Details of the lease of Clutha House by Kensingtons Chartered Surveyors on behalf of GM Investment Trustees (a financial services company)] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090413130621/http://www.keningtons.com/index.asp?PageID=400 |date=April 13, 2009 }} Accessed 19 February 2009&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike similar think tanks, including its stablefellows [[Civitas (think tank)|Civitas]] and [[Policy Exchange]], the Centre for Social Cohesion is not registered with the [[Charity Commission for England and Wales]].&lt;ref name="CCInfo"&gt;[http://www.charitycommission.gov.uk/SHOWCHARITY/RegisterOfCharities/RegisterHomePage.aspx Charities Commission Register] Accessed 19 February 2009&lt;/ref&gt; According to Companies House, the Centre for Social Cohesion was dissolved on 15 January 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Companies House Records for Centre for Social Cohesion |url=http://wck2.companieshouse.gov.uk//companysearch?disp=1&amp;frfsh=1359633916&amp;#result |publisher=Companies House |accessdate=31 January 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081229053844/http://wck2.companieshouse.gov.uk/ |archivedate=29 December 2008 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Activities and director==
The CSC's web site indicated that its aims were to foster new attitudes to help bring Britain's ethnic and religious communities closer together, while strengthening British traditions of openness, [[Toleration|tolerance]], and [[democracy]]. It researched ethnic and religious communities and organisations in the UK and published analyses.&lt;ref name="socialcohesionAbout"&gt;[http://www.socialcohesion.co.uk/ Centre for Social Cohesion] Accessed 19 February 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

The Centre's Director was [[Douglas Murray (author)|Douglas Murray]], author of ''Neoconservatism: Why We Need It'', and the CSC's web site indicated that its researchers were trained in journalism, philosophy, and Islamic affairs, and include speakers of [[Arabic]], [[Bengali language|Bengali]], [[Urdu]], and other Asian and European languages. The CSC web site indicated that it studied challenges to [[Social liberalism|liberal society]], [[secularism|secular]] democracy, and [[religious pluralism]]. The CSC took the position that [[Islamism]] represents a threat to social cohesion, and analysed its impact in this context.

{{Hispanic and Latino Americans}}
'''Chonga''' is a Spanish-derived term used especially in [[South Florida metropolitan area|South Florida]], often to indicate a working-class, sexualized, aggressive, and emotionally expressive young woman.

Chongas are also a distinct [[subculture]], believed to have developed in [[Miami]] in the late 20th century. Members are typically young, working-class Latina women. In South Florida the term is usually considered a pejorative, though some young women are proud to identify themselves as such. While feminist scholarship on chongas is limited, early work by [[gender studies]] scholar Jillian Hernandez has suggested that the chonga identity is an "emerging [[icon]]", and that it can be empowering for working-class women.

==Etymology and meaning==
The intended meaning of the term "chonga" varies depending on the context in which it is used. The most specific meaning of the term denotes a member of the chonga subculture—young, usually working class and Latina women—who dress and often act in a sexualized, brash, sometimes aggressive manner. The term also has three looser meanings: as a synonym for prostitute; to refer to a woman who acts "gangsta" or in a thug like manner; and among female friends, as a jovial way to greet each other, as an alternative to "girlfriend!"&lt;ref name="hern68"&gt;Hernandez 68.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = "Chongas!"&gt;Lush 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

Usage of the term to refer to young women is believed to have arisen in [[Miami]], and only became prominent in the early 21st century. The same word has long been used in Latin American countries such as [[Peru]] and [[Ecuador]] to refer to a brothel; the modern US usage of the word may be related to this, or might have arisen independently among Floridian Cuban-Americans. 

"Chonga" has lexical similarities with several other Spanish terms, some of which have been in use for centuries.&lt;ref name="hern68"/&gt;&lt;ref name = "Chongas!"/&gt; These include: 
* ''[[Cholo|chola]]''  - used in the [[Southwestern United States]] for women of [[Mexican people|Mexican]] or [[Mexican American|Mexican-American]] descent, sometimes with the added meaning that they are a "homegirl" or someone from the streets.&lt;ref name="hern68"/&gt;
* ''chula'' - which denotes a cute or sexy young woman.&lt;ref name="hern68"/&gt;
* ''chusma'' - in the US, this term is often used to denote  an oversexualized and under-Americanized woman of [[Cuban people|Cuban]] descent. In Latin America, the term can merely refer to loud, working-class women, and can even refer to a rabble, some of whom might not be female.&lt;ref name="hern68"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Muñoz 181.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Chonga subculture==
According to the journalist Tamara Lush, Chonga subculture may have first appeared in [[Miami]] during the 1980s. Early chongas were usually Cuban teenagers whose parents had recently immigrated to the US. In the 1990s, chongas often wore white shorts with a colored thong underneath, basketball jerseys, and fake gold jewelry. Over the years the style evolved, with for instance tight jeans becoming more popular than shorts.&lt;ref name = "Chongas!"/&gt;

===Chonga characteristics===
21st-century chongas will often exhibit at least some of the following characteristics: 
*Cheap but sexy clothing, which often includes "Brazilian jeans"&lt;ref group="note"&gt;Pocketless [[Skinny jeans]] that usually have an accentuating effect on the bottom.&lt;/ref&gt; and revealing tops, a preference for gelled hair, synthetic nails and gaudy jewelry, often including fake gold, bangles and earring hoops.&lt;ref group="note"&gt;Chongas sometimes like to have their names written on the hoops.&lt;/ref&gt;   
*Sexual availability, often along with a preference to be surrounded by men.  
*Hostility to other young women, unless they are fellow members of the same chonga crew.  
*Loud, emotionally expressive and aggressive behavior.&lt;ref name = "Chongas!"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hernandez ''passim'', and esp. 85.&lt;/ref&gt;

Not all chongas live up to these stereotypes; for example, sometimes women whose conduct is the most overtly sexualized will in fact be among the least interested in actual heterosexual encounters—in some cases chonga behavior is perhaps best understood as a kind of bonding between female friends.&lt;ref&gt;Hernandez 85.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Depictions in the media===
Until 2007, chongas have rarely appeared in the media, despite their high visibility in real life. One of the rare exceptions was the ''Cheerleaders'' (2000) set of art photographs by [[Luis Gispert]].&lt;ref&gt;Hernandez 77-79.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.luisgispert.com/index.php#mi=2&amp;pt=1&amp;pi=10000&amp;s=16&amp;p=1&amp;a=0&amp;at=0 The cheerleader set of images on Gispert's web site]. Not all pics feature chonga-like lasses; for an iconic image discussed at length in Hernandez, see pic no. 15. See also pic nos. 3, 9, 16 &amp; 17.&lt;/ref&gt; In popular culture, the few exceptions include [[Bratz]] dolls which have a chonga-like appearance; the chonga-like characters Lydia and Melina in the television comedy [[MADtv]]; and the chonga-like character Tina in the movie ''[[Do the Right Thing]]''.&lt;ref name = "Chongas!"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hernandez 65.&lt;/ref&gt; Chongas became considerably more common in popular culture after the 2007 release of [[Chongalicious]], a YouTube [[viral video]]. Hernandez noted that the only depiction she's aware of that accurately showed chongas in their social context was the 2007 "Bratz girls" exhibition by the ''GisMo Collective'' (Jessica Gispert and Crystal Molinary).&lt;ref&gt;Hernandez 68, 79-86.&lt;/ref&gt;

===In cultural and gender studies===
According to a 2009 article by gender studies scholar Jillian Hernandez, feminist literature covering chongas remains sparse, even after their profile was raised by the ''Chongalicious'' video. Hernandez contrasts this with the extensive body of work on [[Chicana feminism]], which explores the ''chola'' and ''chusma'' phenomena.&lt;ref&gt;Hernandez 86-87.&lt;/ref&gt; Hernandez argues the chonga image has become iconic in Miami, and states that the aesthetic appeal of the chonga can be considerable, which in her opinion partly explains why the ''cheerleaders'' set of photographs was successful in launching Gispert's international career.&lt;ref&gt;Hernandez 80.&lt;/ref&gt;

The portrayal of chongas in the media can, however, be problematic, sometimes even repressive, as powerful negative images contribute to Latinas internalizing pressure to conform which originates from the dominant Anglo-American culture.&lt;ref&gt;Guzmán  2004.&lt;/ref&gt; Stereotypical representations of chongas can play a role in the United States' wider [[culture wars#United States of America|culture wars]], adding to concerns about the sexuality of some Latina women being "out of control" with their perceived high rate of reproduction.&lt;ref&gt;Gutiérrez ch. 7.&lt;/ref&gt; Citing earlier work by Isabel Molina Guzmán,&lt;ref&gt;''Disorderly Bodies and Discourses of Latinidad in the Elián González Story'', Isabel Molina Guzmán (2007)&lt;/ref&gt; Hernandez relates this to the [[Elián González affair]], where the media portrayal of Marisleysis González as having the chonga-like characteristic of emotional excess contributed to the degradation of the  privileged, "model minority status" that [[Cuban Americans]] had previously enjoyed.&lt;ref&gt;Hernandez 66.&lt;/ref&gt;

In her own research, Hernandez found that most people she questioned considered "chonga" a pejorative term. One respondent even went as far as to say the term sums up all the negative Latina stereotypes. A few asserted that while they know several chongas, they don't know any who self-identify as such. Sometimes Latina women will admit they went through a brief "chonga" phase in their early teens, but later came to view the style as uncool. Yet some chongas chose to retain the identity into their twenties. Hernandez also found that some young woman are proud to call themselves chongas. Several expressed pride in their sexual attractiveness. The creators of "Chongalicious", who are themselves middle class, found they had considerably more male attention while pretending to be chongas, one of them saying back in 2007 that "I think we would have boyfriends if we were real chongas."&lt;ref name = "Chongas!"/&gt; Hernandez suggests that the chonga sub culture is in several ways a positive thing, representing women who are not shamed into invisibility by their low-class status or ethnic identity. She anticipates a broadening and deepening of feminist scholarship on chongas, to uncover the ways in which the chonga identity can be helpful to young women exploring their "bodies and pleasures".&lt;ref group="note"&gt;Hernandez notes that she is consciously echoing [[Michel Foucault]] in using the term "bodies and pleasures", as she sees it as a more empowering alternative to "sexuality".&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hernandez ''passim'', esp. 86-87.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Closed ecological systems''' ('''CES''') are [[ecosystems]] that do not rely on matter exchange with any part outside the system.

The term is most often used to describe small [[wikt:manmade|manmade]] ecosystems. Such systems are scientifically interesting and can potentially serve as a [[life support system]] during [[space flight]]s, in [[space stations]] or [[space habitat]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=Manmade Closed Ecological Systems | author= I. I. Gitelson | author2= G. M. Lisovsky | author3= R. D. MacElroy | last-author-amp= yes | publisher= [[Taylor &amp; Francis]] |date=2003 | ISBN = 0-415-29998-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a closed ecological system, any waste products produced by one species must be used by at least one other species. If the purpose is to maintain a life form, such as a [[mouse]] or a [[human]], waste products such as [[carbon dioxide]], [[feces]] and [[urine]] must eventually be converted into [[oxygen]], [[food]], and [[water]].

A closed ecological system must contain at least one [[autotroph]]ic organism. While both [[chemotroph]]ic and [[phototroph]]ic organisms are plausible, almost all closed ecological systems to date are based on a phototroph such as green [[algae]].

== Examples ==

A closed ecological system for an entire planet is called an [[Ecosphere (planetary)|ecosphere]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cof.orst.edu/cof/fs/turner/pdfs/lexicon_of_the_spheres.pdf|title=A Lexicon of the Spheres|publisher=[[Oregon State University]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sciencehelpdesk.com/unit/science2/11|title=ESO 2 Science 11: The Ecosphere and the Ecosystems|publisher=Science Helpdesk}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Artificiality|Man-made]] closed ecological systems which were created to sustain human life include [[Biosphere 2]], [[MELiSSA]], and the BIOS-1, BIOS-2, and [[BIOS-3]] projects.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | journal=BioScience | date=Oct 1997 | volume=47 |issue=9 | pages=575–85 | title= Bios-3: Siberian experiments in bioregenerative life support | author=Salisbury FB | author2=Gitelson JI | author3=Lisovsky GM | doi=10.2307/1313164 | pmid=11540303}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Bottle garden]]s and [[Ecosphere (aquarium)|aquarium ecospheres]] are partially or fully enclosed glass containers that are self-sustaining closed ecosystems that can be made or purchased. They can include tiny [[shrimp]], [[algae]], [[gravel]], decorative [[Animal shell|shell]]s, and [[gorgonia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.ecospheres.co.uk/what-is-an-ecosphere/  | title=What is an EcoSphere?  (Shrimp and Gorgonia coral)}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In fiction==

The 1993 novel ''[[This Other Eden (novel)|This Other Eden]]'' by [[Ben Elton]] featured the development of "claustrospheres" which were closed ecological systems contained within a dome in which people could take refuge in the event of environmental collapse.

The critically panned 1996 comedy film ''[[Bio-Dome]]'' involved the protagonists becoming trapped in a closed ecological system being run as an experiment.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1511">The term '''cohort effect''' is used in [[social science]] to describe variations in the characteristics of an area of study (such as the incidence of a characteristic or the age at onset) over time among individuals who are defined by some shared temporal experience or common life experience, such as year of birth, or year of exposure to radiation.

Cohort effects are important to [[epidemiologists]] searching for patterns in illnesses.  Certain illnesses may be socially affected via the [[Anticipation (genetics)|anticipation phenomenon]], and cohort effects can be an indicator of this sort of phenomenon.

Cohort effects are important to resource dependency and economics theorists when these groups affect structures of influence within their larger organizations. Cohorts in organizations are often defined by entry or birth date, and retain some common characteristic (size, cohesiveness, competition) that can affect the organization. For example, cohort effects are critical issues in school enrollment. 

In order to determine whether a cohort effect is present, a researcher may conduct a [[cohort study]].

'''Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory''' ('''CSHL''') is a private, non-profit institution with research programs focusing on cancer, [[neuroscience]], plant biology, [[genomics]], and [[quantitative biology]].&lt;ref&gt;As described here: [http://www.cshl.edu] and here: [http://www.cshl.edu/Annual-Reports/2012-annual-report]&lt;/ref&gt;

It is one of 68 institutions supported by the [[NCI-designated Cancer Center|Cancer Centers Program]] of the U.S. [[National Cancer Institute]] (NCI) and has been an NCI-designated Cancer Center since 1987.&lt;ref&gt;[http://cancercenters.cancer.gov/cancer_centers/index.html]&lt;/ref&gt;  The Laboratory is one of a handful of institutions that played a central role in the development of molecular genetics and [[molecular biology]].&lt;ref&gt;Horace Freedland Judson, ''The Eighth Day of Creation: The Makers of the Revolution in Biology'' (Simon &amp; Schuster, 1979), esp. pp. 65-69; also: 44-46; 53; 57-58; 62; 70; 82; 185; 232; 239; 247; 273; 321; 368; 392; 454; 458-59; 572-73.&lt;/ref&gt;

It has been home to eight scientists who have been awarded the [[Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine]]. CSHL is ranked among the leading [[basic research]] institutions in molecular biology and genetics with Thomson Reuters ranking it #1 in the world.&lt;ref&gt;See Thompson Reuters Essential Science Indicators, [http://archive.sciencewatch.com/dr/sci/08/may25-08_4/]. The ranking is based on average citation frequency of faculty research papers published between January 2002 and December 2012. (96.94 citations of each CSHL paper, average.)&lt;/ref&gt;  The Laboratory is led by [[Bruce Stillman]], a biochemist and cancer researcher.

Since its inception in 1890, the institution's campus on the [[North Shore (Long Island)|North Shore]] of [[Long Island]] has also been a center of biology education. Current CSHL educational programs serve professional scientists, doctoral students in biology, teachers of biology in the K-12 system, and students from the elementary grades through high school. In the past 10 years CSHL conferences &amp; courses have drawn over 81,000 scientists and students to the main campus.&lt;ref name="cshl.edu"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cshl.edu/About-Us/Facts-Figures|title=CSHL Facts &amp; Figures - About Us|author=WebServices|publisher=|access-date=2014-03-14|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140322050319/https://www.cshl.edu/About-Us/Facts-Figures|archive-date=2014-03-22|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  For this reason, many scientists consider CSHL a "crossroads of biological science."&lt;ref&gt;Examples include: Francis Collins, M.D., Ph.D., current director of the U.S. National Institutes of Health: [http://library.cshl.edu/oralhistory/interview/genome-research/competition-science/competition-human-genome-project-public-vs-private/]; Nobel laureate Sydney Brenner: [http://library.cshl.edu/oralhistory/interview/cshl/special-aspects/cold-spring-harbor-laboratory-center-science/]; Nobel laureate Eric Kandel, M.D., referring to the institutional setting of CSHL's graduate school: [http://www.cshl.edu/Archive/watson-school-of-biological-sciences-culminates-commencement-weekend-conferring-degrees-on-its-fifth-graduating-class]; See also:  R. Sanders Williams, "Sputnik, Slime Molds, and Botticelli in the Making of a Physician-Scientist," in David A. Schwartz, ed., Medicine, Science and Dreams: The Making of Physician-Scientists (Springer, 2010, p. 103.)&lt;/ref&gt; Since 2009 CSHL has partnered with the [[Suzhou Industrial Park]] in [[Suzhou]], China to create '''Cold Spring Harbor Asia''' which annually draws some 3,000 scientists to its meetings and courses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.csh-asia.org/overview.html|title=CSH Asia Overview|website=www.csh-asia.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2015, CSHL announced a strategic affiliation with the nearby [[Northwell Health]] to  advance cancer therapeutics research, develop a new clinical cancer research unit at Northwell Health in [[Lake Success, New York|Lake Success]], NY, to support early-phase clinical studies of new cancer therapies, and recruit and train more clinician-scientists in oncology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cshl.edu/news-and-features/cold-spring-harbor-laboratory-and-north-shore-lij-announce-strategic-affiliation-to-accelerate-benefits-of-cancer-research-to-patients.html|title=CSHL Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory and North Shore-LIJ announce strategic affiliation to accelerate benefits of cancer research to patients - News &amp; Features|author=Dagnia Zeidlickis}}&lt;/ref&gt;

CSHL hosts [[bioRxiv]], the preprint repository for biologists.

==Educational programs==
[[File:Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory sign.jpg|thumb|Sign at the entrance at 500 Sunnyside Blvd.]]
In addition to its research mission, CSHL has a broad educational mission. The Watson School of Biological Sciences (WSBS), established in 1998, awards the Ph.D. degree and fully funds the research program of every student. Students are challenged to obtain their doctoral degree in 4–5 years.  The Undergraduate Research Program (URP) for gifted college students (established in 1959), and the Partners for the Future Program for advanced high school students (established in 1990) are now hosted at the WSBS.

The CSHL Meetings &amp; Courses Program brings over 8,500 scientists from around the world to Cold Spring Harbor annually to share research results – mostly unpublished—in 60 meetings, most held biannually; and to learn new technologies in 30 to 35 professional courses, most offered annually.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;  The Cold Spring Harbor Symposium series, held every year since 1933 with the exception of three years during the Second World War, has been a forum for researchers in genetics, genomics, neuroscience and plant biology. At the Banbury Center, about 25-30 discussion-style meetings are held yearly for a limited number of invited participants. As of 2016 a two-week course at CSHL costs between $3,700 and $4,700 per student and a three-day conferences cost about $1,000 per attendee.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://meetings.cshl.edu/courseshome.aspx|title=CSHL Courses|website=meetings.cshl.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The DNA Learning Center (DNALC), founded in 1988, was among the early pioneers&lt;ref&gt;See early DNALC annual reports: 1985: [http://www.dnalc.org/files/pdf/annreppdf/annrep1985.pdf]; and 1988: [http://www.dnalc.org/files/pdf/annreppdf/annrep1988.pdf]. For the educational milieu at the time hands-on learning caught on nationally, see: Kyle, Jr. W.C., Bonnstetter, R.J., McClosky, J. &amp; Fults, B.A. (1985). "What Research Says: Science through discovery: Students love it," ''Science and Children'', 23 (2), 39-41; Lumpe, A.T. &amp; Oliver, J.S. (1991) "Dimensions of Hands-on Science," ''The American Biology Teacher'', 53 (6), 345-348; Rutherford, F. J. &amp; Ahlgren, A. (1990), ''Science for All Americans'' (New York: Oxford University Press), p. 186ff.; Schmieder, A.A. &amp; Michael-Dyer, G. (1991)., "State of the scene of science education in the nation," Paper presented at the Public Health Service National Conference, Washington, D.C.&lt;/ref&gt; in developing hands-on genetics lab experiences for middle and high school students.  In 2013, 31,000 students on Long Island and New York City were taught genetics labs at the DNALC and satellite facilities in New York. Over 9,000 high school biology teachers have participated in DNALC teacher-training programs.&lt;ref&gt;DNA Learning Center, 2013 Annual Report, in press.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press]] has established a program consisting of seven journals, 190 books, laboratory manuals and protocols, and online services for research preprints.&lt;ref name="cshl.edu"/&gt;

==Funding==
In 2015, CSHL had an operating budget of $150 million, over $100 million of which was spent on research.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.cshl.edu/images/stories/about_us/pdfs/2013-CSHL-factsheet.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;  Half of the research budget was devoted to cancer; 25% to neuroscience; 15% to genomics and quantitative biology; and 10% to plant sciences.  The sources of research funding in 2015 were: 34% Federal (primarily [[National Institutes of Health]] and [[National Science Foundation]]); 26% auxiliary activities; 22% private philanthropy; 10% endowment; 3% corporate.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

==Founding and early years==
The institution took root as The Biological Laboratory in 1890, a summer program for the education of college and high school teachers studying zoology, botany, comparative anatomy and nature. The program began as an initiative of Eugene G. Blackford and [[Franklin Hooper]], director of the Brooklyn Institute of Arts and Sciences, the founding institution of [[The Brooklyn Museum]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |ref=harv |last=Watson |first=Edith L. |title=Houses for Science: a Pictorial History of the Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory |year=1991 |publisher=CSHL Press, 1991 |pages=20–23 |isbn=9780879694036 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=KQHhyobFZfwC&amp;pg=PA20}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1904, the [[Carnegie Institution of Washington]] established the '''Station for Experimental Evolution''' at Cold Spring Harbor on an adjacent parcel. In 1921, the station was reorganized as the Carnegie Institution Department of Genetics.

Between 1910 and 1939, the laboratory was the base of the [[Eugenics Record Office]] of biologist [[Charles B. Davenport]] and his assistant [[Harry H. Laughlin]], two prominent [[American eugenicists]] of the period.  Davenport was director of the Carnegie Station from its inception until his retirement in 1934. In 1935 the Carnegie Institution sent a team to review the ERO's work, and as a result the ERO was ordered to stop all work. In 1939 the Institution withdrew funding for the ERO entirely, leading to its closure. The ERO's reports, articles, charts, and pedigrees were considered scientific facts in their day, but have since been discredited. However, its closure came 15 years after its findings were incorporated into the National Origins Act ([[Immigration Act of 1924]]), which severely reduced the number of immigrants to America from southern and eastern Europe who, Harry Laughlin testified, were racially inferior to the Nordic immigrants from England and Germany. Charles Davenport was also the founder and the first director of the [[International Federation of Eugenics Organizations]] in 1925. Today, Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory maintains the full historical records, communications and artifacts of the ERO for historical,&lt;ref&gt;See [[Daniel J. Kevles]], ''In the Name of Eugenics: Genetics and the Uses of Human Heredity'' (Alfred A. Knopf, 1985); [[Elof A.

Carnegie Institution scientists at Cold Spring Harbor made many contributions to genetics and medicine. In 1908 [[George H. Shull]] discovered hybrid corn and the genetic principle behind it called [[heterosis]],  or "hybrid vigor."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Shull | first1 = GH | year = 1907 | title = THE SIGNIFICANCE OF LATENT CHARACTERS | url = | journal = [[Science (journal)|Science]] | volume = 25 | issue = 646| pages = 792–794 | doi = 10.1126/science.25.646.792 | pmid = 17810906 | bibcode = 1907Sci....25..792H }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Shull | first1 = GH | year = 1907 | title = SOME LATENT CHARACTERS OF A WHITE BEAN | url = | journal = [[Science (journal)|Science]] | volume = 25 | issue = 647| pages = 828–832 | doi = 10.1126/science.25.647.828-b | pmid = 17828973 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This would become the foundation of modern agricultural genetics.

Bates and Simon W. Dykshorn "A New Hormone of the Anterior Pituitary," ''[[Proc. Soc. Exp. Biol. Med.]]'' 1932; xxix: 1211-1212.&lt;/ref&gt; and Wilbur Swingle participated in the discovery of [[adrenocortical hormone]], used to treat [[Addison's disease]].

==History==
[[Milislav Demerec]] was named director of the Laboratory in 1941. Demerec shifted the Laboratory's research focus to the genetics of microbes, thus setting investigators on a course to study the biochemical function of the gene. During World War Two, Demerec directed efforts at Cold Spring Harbor that resulted in major increases in penicillin production.&lt;ref&gt;See U.S. Patent 2,445,748 (July 27, 1948). Demerec used x-ray mutagenesis to produce a high-yielding strain of ''Penicillium'' mold.  This facilitated a fivefold increase in penicillin production.&lt;/ref&gt;

Beginning in 1941, and annually from 1945, three of the seminal figures of molecular genetics convened summer meetings at Cold Spring Harbor of what they called the [[Phage Group]]. [[Salvador Luria]],  of Indiana University; [[Max Delbrück]],  then of Vanderbilt University; and [[Alfred Hershey]],  then of Washington University, St. Louis, sought to discover the nature of genes through study of viruses called bacteriophages that infect bacteria.

* In 1945, Delbrück's famous Phage Course was taught for the first time, inspiring, among others, a young [[James D. Watson]]; it was repeated for many years after. CSH Symposia important in the cross-fertilization of ideas among molecular biology's pioneers were held in 1951, 1953, 1956, 1961, 1963, and 1966.&lt;ref&gt;"Coming of Phage: Celebrating the Fiftieth Anniversary of the First Phage Course," Pamphlet, 14 pp., 1995.  Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory.&lt;/ref&gt;   
* At the CSH Symposium in summer 1953, Watson made the first public presentation of DNA's double-helix structure.

'''Nobel Prize winners'''
* In 1944 [[Barbara McClintock]] discovered [[transposons]] ("jumping genes"), for which she received a [[Nobel Prize]] in 1983.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/medicine/laureates/1983/] See the classic paper McClintock B 1951 "Chromosome Organization and Genic Expression" (''Cold Spring Harbor Symp. Quant. Biol'' 16: 13-47).&lt;/ref&gt;  
* In 1952 the "Waring blender [[Hershey–Chase experiment|experiments]]" of [[Alfred Hershey]] and [[Martha Chase]] confirmed DNA as the genetic material.&lt;ref&gt;A.D. Hershey and Martha Chase, "Independent Functions of Viral Protein and Nucleic Acid in Growth of Bacteriophage," ''[[J. General Physiology]]'' (September 20, 1952) 36:1, 39-56.&lt;/ref&gt;   Hershey shared a Nobel Prize with Salvador Luria and Max Delbrück in 1969, "for their discoveries concerning the replication mechanism and the genetic structure of viruses."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/medicine/laureates/1969/|title=The Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine 1969|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Watson, CSHL Director from 1968 to 1993, shared a Nobel Prize with [[Francis Crick]] and [[Maurice Wilkins]] in 1962 for their discovery of the double helix structure of DNA.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/medicine/laureates/1962/|title=The Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine 1962|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
* [[Richard J. Roberts]] and [[Phillip A. Sharp]] shared a Nobel in 1993 for the discovery of discontinuous, or "split" genes, which revealed the [[RNA splicing]] mechanism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/medicine/laureates/1993/|title=The Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine 1993|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
* [[Carol Greider]], who in 1992 discovered a relationship between cellular aging and damage to the ends of chromosomes, called [[telomeres]], shared a Nobel Prize in 2009 with [[Elizabeth Blackburn]] and [[Jack W. Szostak]] for their work on telomere biology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/medicine/laureates/2009/|title=The Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine 2009|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Leadership==
In 1962, the Department of Genetics, no longer supported by the Carnegie Institution of Washington, formally merged with the Biological Laboratory to form the Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory of Quantitative Biology. In 1970, the name was simplified to Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory.

James D. Watson served as the Laboratory's director and president for 35 years. Upon  taking charge in 1968, he focused the Laboratory on cancer research, creating a tumor virus group and successfully obtaining federal funds for an expansion of cancer research capabilities. Watson placed CSHL on a firm financial footing. Inspired by his Nobel collaborator, Francis Crick, Watson initiated a major push to scale-up CSHL research on the brain and psychiatric disorders, beginning in the late 1980s.  In 1990, work was completed on the [[Arnold and Mabel Beckman]] Laboratory, and the Marks Neuroscience Building was opened in 1999.  In 1994, Watson ceased being director of the Laboratory and assumed the title of president. In 2004 he was named chancellor, a position he held until October 2007,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cshl.edu/Non-Research-Faculty/james-d-watson.html]&lt;/ref&gt;  when he  retired at the age of 79 after views attributed to him on [[race and intelligence]] appeared in the British press.&lt;ref&gt;[[James watson#cite note-Africans-45]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[James watson#cite note-Suspension-46]]&lt;/ref&gt; He is now chancellor emeritus.

Since 1994 biochemist and cancer biologist [[Bruce Stillman]] has led the Laboratory as director, and since 2003 as president. Stillman, a member of the [[National Academy of Sciences]] and a [[Fellow of the Royal Society]], also continues to run a basic research lab, devoted to the study of DNA replication and chromosome maintenance. Stillman is credited with the 1991 discovery and elucidation of the mechanism of the [[Origin Recognition Complex]] (ORC), a highly conserved protein complex that recognizes and binds to specific DNA sequences, marking starting points for replication of the entire genome.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | pmid = 8939847 | volume=274 | title=Cell cycle control of DNA replication | date=December 1996 | journal=Science | pages=1659–64 | last1 = Stillman | first1 = B | doi=10.1126/science.274.5293.1659| bibcode=1996Sci...274.1659S }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Stillman has presided over a major expansion of the Laboratory, its size growing threefold since he became director. With construction completed on six linked laboratory buildings on the Hillside Campus in 2009, CSHL added much-needed new laboratory space for cancer and neuroscience research, as well as space for a new program on quantitative biology to bring experts in mathematics, computer science, statistics, and physics to problems in biology.

'''David Fallows''' (born 20 December 1945)&lt;ref name="NG"&gt;Rosemary Williamson; {{GroveMusic|id=47084|label=Fallows, David}}&lt;/ref&gt; is an English [[Musicology|musicologist]] specializing in music of the [[ars nova|late Middle Ages]] and [[Renaissance music|Renaissance]] and the [[performance practice]] of music. He is a leader in fifteenth-century music studies, particularly [[Guillaume Dufay]]&lt;!-- Do not change to Du Fay, since Dufay is Fallows's preferred spelling--&gt;, [[Josquin des Prez]], and secular song.

==Biography==
Fallows was born in [[Buxton]]. He received his [[Bachelors of Arts|BA]] from [[Jesus College, Cambridge|Jesus College]], [[Cambridge University|Cambridge]], his Masters of Music from [[King's College, London]], and his Ph.D. (1978) from the [[University of California, Berkeley]].&lt;ref name="NG"/&gt;&lt;ref name="homepage"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.manchester.ac.uk/research/David.fallows/|title=Research page at University of Manchester}}&lt;/ref&gt; He is an early music performer as a [[viol]] player and [[Figured bass#Basso continuo|continuo]] [[harpsichord]]ist, performing with the [[Studio der frühen Musik]], [[Musica Mundana]], and [[Musica Reservata (group)|Musica Reservata]].&lt;ref name="homepage"/&gt;

He taught at the [[University of Manchester]] starting in 1976, where he is now Emeritus Professor of Musicology. Visiting appointments include [[University of Wisconsin, Madison]], [[University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill]], [[École Normale Supérieure]], [[University of Basel]], [[Harvard University]] and the [[University of Vienna]]. He received the [[Dent Medal]] in 1982,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rma.ac.uk/awards/dent_medal.htm|title=RMA Awards and Grants: The Dent Medal}}&lt;/ref&gt; became [[Chevalier de l'Ordre des Arts et des Lettres]] in 1994, a [[Fellow of the British Academy]] in 1997, a Corresponding Member of the [[American Musicological Society]] in 1999, and an Honorary Member of the [[Royal Musical Association]] in 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rma.ac.uk/awards/honorary_members.htm|title=Honorary Members of the Royal Musical Association}}&lt;/ref&gt;  From 2002–2007, he was president of the [[International Musicological Society]].

His contributions were honoured with a [[Festschrift]], ''Essays on Renaissance Music in Honour of David Fallows: Bon jour, bon mois, et bonne estrenne.''&lt;ref name="festschrift"&gt;Fabrice Fitch and Jacobijn Kiel, editors, ''Essays on Renaissance Music in Honour of David Fallows: Bon jour, bon mois, et bonne estrenne.'' (Woodbridge: Boydell, 2011).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Work==
David Fallows's work has been called "pioneering" on the lives of composers and of the ensembles that performed music,&lt;ref name="NG"/&gt; and having covered "just about every aspect of fifteenth- and early sixteenth-century music."&lt;ref&gt;Noel O'Regan, review of the Festschrift in ''Music and Letters,'' 93.3 (2012).&lt;/ref&gt; Among Fallows's first publications was, "Ciconia padre e figlio" (Ciconia: father and son; 1976), which theorized that the current biography of [[Johannes Ciconia]] was primarily that of his father, and that the composer himself was born about thirty-five years later.&lt;ref&gt;Giuliano Di Bacco and John Nádas, "Ciconia, Johannes: 1. Life" in ''The [[New Grove Dictionary of Music and Musicians]]'', 2nd Edition (London: Macmillan, 2001).&lt;/ref&gt; This theory has become the accepted biography of the composer. Also during his doctoral studies he reconstructed the origins of the important fourteenth-century polyphonic manuscripts in [[Cambrai]] ("L'origine du MS. 1328 de Cambrai"). His 1978 dissertation, "[[Robert Morton (composer)|Robert Morton]]'s Songs" was among Fallows's first works on English Renaissance music and fifteenth-century song, repertories that have concerned him throughout his life (including in his 2014 [[Musica Britannica]] volume on English song, 1380–1480). These studies formed the basis for his comprehensive ''A Catalogue of Polyphonic Songs, 1415–1480'' (Oxford 1999). A major article on the life of [[Johannes Regis]] (1989) also had a transformative impact on the understanding of the composer. His 2009 study of the life and works of [[Josquin des Prez]] (Brepols) has been praised for understanding the conflicting information recently unearthed about the composer as well as presenting new hypotheses and understanding of the composer's music in light of new discoveries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=D. Fallows, ''Josquin''|url=http://www.brepols.net/Pages/ShowProduct.aspx?prod_id=IS-9782503530659-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Fallows's 1982 monograph ''Dufay'' is the principal reference work on the life and works of the composer [[Guillaume Dufay]]. He has edited and introduced facsimile publications of the Songbook of [[Henry VIII]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bl.uk/learning/timeline/item101064.html|title=Songs written by Henry VIII|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; the manuscript [[Bodleian Library|Oxford]], Canon. Misc 213, the [[Chansonnier Cordiforme]], and others. As senior consulting editor for [[The New Grove Dictionary of Music and Musicians]], Fallows contributed many major articles along with many small articles on musical diacritics (tempo and expression marks) and miscellany such as "Spoof Articles."&lt;ref&gt;David Fallows, "{{GroveMusic|id=53081|label=Spoof articles|linkonly=t}}," in ''The [[New Grove Dictionary of Music and Musicians]]'', 2nd Edition (London: Macmillan, 2001).&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[mathematical physics]], '''de Sitter invariant special relativity''' is the speculative idea that the fundamental [[symmetry group]] of [[spacetime]] is the [[indefinite orthogonal group]] SO(4,1), that of [[de Sitter space]]. In the standard theory of [[general relativity]], de Sitter space is a highly symmetrical special [[vacuum solution]], which requires a [[cosmological constant]] or the [[Stress–energy tensor|stress–energy]] of a constant [[scalar field]] to sustain.

The idea of de Sitter invariant relativity is to require that the laws of physics are not fundamentally invariant under the [[Poincaré group]] of [[special relativity]], but under the symmetry group of de Sitter space instead. With this assumption, empty space automatically has de Sitter symmetry, and what would normally be called the cosmological constant in general relativity becomes a fundamental dimensional parameter describing the symmetry structure of spacetime.

First proposed by [[Luigi Fantappiè]] in 1954, the theory remained obscure until it was rediscovered in 1968 by [[Henri Bacry]] and [[Jean-Marc Lévy-Leblond]]. In 1972, [[Freeman Dyson]] popularized it as a hypothetical road by which mathematicians could have guessed part of the structure of general relativity before it was discovered.&lt;ref name=dyson&gt;

==Introduction==
{{main|de Sitter space}}

[[De Sitter]] suggested that spacetime curvature might not be due solely to gravity&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite journal
 |author=W. de Sitter
 |year=1917
 |title=On the curvature of space
 |journal=Proc. Roy. Acad. Sci. Amsterdam
 |volume=20 |issue= |pages=229–243
}}&lt;/ref&gt; but he did not give any mathematical details of how this could be accomplished. In 1968 [[Henri Bacry]] and [[Jean-Marc Lévy-Leblond]] showed that the de Sitter group was the most general group compatible with isotropy, homogeneity and boost invariance.&lt;ref name=posskinem/&gt; Later, [[Freeman Dyson]]&lt;ref name=dyson/&gt; advocated this as an approach to making the mathematical structure of general relativity more self-evident.

[[Hermann Minkowski|Minkowski]]'s unification of space and time within [[special relativity]] replaces the [[Galilean group]] of [[Newtonian mechanics]] with the [[Lorentz group]]. This is called a unification of space and time because the Lorentz group is [[simple group|simple]], while the Galilean group is a [[semi-direct product]] of rotations and [[Galilean transformation|Galilean boosts]]. This means that the Lorentz group mixes up space and time such that they cannot be disentangled, while the Galilean group treats time as a parameter with different units of measurement than space.

An analogous thing can be made to happen with the ordinary rotation group in three dimensions. If you imagine a nearly flat world, one in which pancake-like creatures wander around on a pancake flat world, their conventional unit of height might be the [[micrometre]] (''μm''), since that is how high typical structures are in their world, while their unit of distance could be the metre, because that is their body's horizontal extent.  Such creatures would describe the basic symmetry of their world as [[SO(2)]], being the known rotations in the horizontal (x–y) plane. Later on, they might discover rotations around the x- and y-axes—and in their everyday experience such rotations might always be by an infinitesimal angle, so that these rotations would effectively commute with each other.

The rotations around the horizontal axes would tilt objects by an infinitesimal amount. The tilt in the x–z plane (the "x-tilt") would be one parameter, and the tilt in the y–z plane (the "y-tilt") another. The symmetry group of this pancake world is then SO(2) semidirect product with '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, meaning that a two-dimensional rotation plus two extra parameters, the x-tilt and the y-tilt. The reason it is a semidirect product is that, when you rotate, the x-tilt and the y-tilt rotate into each other, since they form a [[Visualization software|vector]] and not two [[scalar (physics)|scalar]]s. In this world, the difference in height between two objects at the same x, y would be a rotationally invariant quantity unrelated to length and width. The z-coordinate is effectively separate from x and y.

Eventually, experiments at large angles would convince the creatures that the symmetry of the world is [[SO(3)]]. Then they would understand that z is really the same as x and y, since they can be mixed up by rotations. The SO(2) semidirect product R&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; limit would be understood as the limit that the free parameter ''μ'', the ratio of the height range ''μm'' to the length range ''m'', approaches 0. The Lorentz group is analogous—it is a simple group that turns into the Galilean group when the time range is made long compared to the space range, or where velocities may be regarded as infinitesimal, or equivalently, may be regarded as the limit {{nowrap|''c''  → ∞}}, where relativistic effects become observable "as good as at infinite velocity".

The symmetry group of special relativity is not entirely simple, due to translations. The Lorentz group is the set of the transformations that keep the origin fixed, but translations are not included. The full Poincaré group is the semi-direct product of translations with the Lorentz group. If translations are to be similar to elements of the Lorentz group, then as [[Lorentz boost|boosts]] are [[non-commutative]], [[translation (physics)|translations]] would also be non-commutative.

In the pancake world, this would manifest if the creatures were living on an enormous sphere rather than on a plane.  In this case, when they wander around their sphere, they would eventually come to realize that translations are not entirely separate from rotations, because if they move around on the surface of a sphere, when they come back to where they started, they find that they have been rotated by the [[holonomy]] of [[parallel transport]] on the sphere. If the universe is the same everywhere (homogeneous) and there are no preferred directions (isotropic), then there are not many options for the symmetry group: they either live on a flat plane, or on a sphere with a constant positive curvature, or on a [[Lobachevski plane]] with constant negative curvature.  If they are not living on the plane, they can describe positions using dimensionless angles, the same parameters that describe rotations, so that translations and rotations are nominally unified.

In relativity, if translations mix up nontrivially with rotations, but the universe is still [[Homogeneity (physics)|homogeneous]] and [[isotropic]], the only option is that spacetime has a uniform scalar curvature. If the curvature is positive, the analog of the sphere case for the two-dimensional creatures, the spacetime is [[de Sitter space]] and its symmetry group is the de Sitter group rather than the [[Poincaré group]].

De Sitter special relativity postulates that the empty space has de Sitter symmetry as a fundamental law of nature. This means that spacetime is slightly curved even in the absence of matter or energy. This residual [[spacetime curvature|curvature]] implies a positive [[cosmological constant]] {{math|''Λ''}} to be determined by observation. Due to the small magnitude of the constant, special relativity with its Poincaré group is indistinguishable from de Sitter space for most practical purposes.

Modern proponents of this idea, such as S. Cacciatori, V. Gorini and A. Kamenshchik,&lt;ref name=c21st&gt;

They postulate that the acceleration of the expansion of the universe is not entirely due to [[Dark energy|vacuum energy]], but at least partly due to the kinematics of the [[de Sitter]] [[group (mathematics)|group]], which would replace the [[Poincaré group]].

A modification of this idea allows &lt;math&gt;\Lambda&lt;/math&gt; to change with time, so that [[inflation]] may come from the cosmological constant being larger near the [[big bang]] than nowadays. It can also be viewed as a different approach to the problem of [[quantum gravity]].&lt;ref name="newroad"&gt;

===High energy===
The [[Poincaré group]] [[Galilean transformation#Origin in group contraction|contracts]] to the [[Galilean group]] for low-velocity [[kinematics]], meaning that when all velocities are small the Poincaré group "morphs" into the Galilean group. (This can be made precise with [[Erdal İnönü|İnönü]] and [[Eugene Wigner|Wigner]]'s concept of [[group contraction]].&lt;ref&gt;

Similarly, the de Sitter group  [[group contraction|contracts]] to the Poincaré group for short-distance kinematics, when the magnitudes of all translations considered are very small compared to the de Sitter radius.&lt;ref name="newroad"/&gt; In quantum mechanics, short distances are probed by high energies, so that for energies above a very small value related to the cosmological constant, the Poincaré group is a good approximation to the de Sitter group.

In de Sitter relativity, the cosmological constant is no longer a free parameter of the same type; it is determined by the de Sitter radius, a fundamental quantity that determines the commutation relation of translation with rotations/boosts. This means that the theory of de Sitter relativity might be able to provide insight on the value of the cosmological constant, perhaps explaining the [[Dark energy#Quintessence|cosmic coincidence]]. Unfortunately, the de Sitter radius, which determines the cosmological constant, is an adjustable parameter in de Sitter relativity, so the theory requires a separate condition to determine its value in relation to the measurement scale.

When a cosmological constant is viewed as a kinematic parameter, the definitions of energy and momentum must be changed from those of special relativity. These changes could significantly modify the physics of the early universe if the cosmological constant was greater back then. Some speculate that a high energy experiment could modify the local structure of spacetime from [[Minkowski space]] to [[de Sitter space]] with a large cosmological constant for a short period of time, and this might eventually be tested in the existing or planned [[particle collider]].&lt;ref&gt;

===Doubly special relativity===
{{main|Doubly special relativity}}

Since the de Sitter group naturally incorporates an invariant length parameter, de Sitter relativity can be interpreted as an example of the so-called [[doubly special relativity]]. There is a fundamental difference, though: whereas in all doubly special relativity models the Lorentz symmetry is violated, in de Sitter relativity it remains as a physical symmetry.&lt;ref&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt; A drawback of the usual doubly special relativity models is that they are valid only at the energy scales where ordinary special relativity is supposed to break down, giving rise to a patchwork relativity. On the other hand, de Sitter relativity is found to be invariant under a simultaneous re-scaling of [[mass]], [[energy]] and [[momentum]],&lt;ref name=dessrintro&gt;

 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This has the effect that in the nonrelativistic limit, objects in de Sitter space have an extra "repulsion" from the origin: objects have a tendency to move away from the center with an outward pointing [[fictitious force]] proportional to their distance from the origin.

While it looks as though this might pick out a preferred point in space—the center of repulsion, it is more subtly isotropic. Moving to the uniformly accelerated frame of reference of an observer at another point, all accelerations appear to have a repulsion center at the new point.

What this means is that in a spacetime with non-vanishing curvature, gravity is modified from Newtonian gravity.&lt;ref&gt;

The '''foot''' (plural '''feet''') is an [[anatomical]] structure found in many [[vertebrates]]. It is the terminal portion of a limb which bears weight and allows [[Animal locomotion|locomotion]]. In many animals with feet, the foot is a separate organ at the terminal part of the [[leg]] made up of one or more segments or bones, generally including claws or nails.

==Etymology==
The word "foot", in the sense of meaning the "terminal part of the leg of a vertebrate animal" comes from "Old English fot "foot," from Proto-Germanic *fot (source also of Old Frisian fot, Old Saxon fot, Old Norse fotr, Danish fod, Swedish fot, Dutch voet, Old High German fuoz, German Fuß, Gothic fotus "foot"), from PIE root *ped- "foot." &lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?allowed_in_frame=0&amp;search=foot |title=Foot |author=&lt;!--Not stated--&gt; |date= |website=www.etymonline.com |publisher=Online Etymology Dictionary |access-date=20 May 2017 |quote= |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170802093751/http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?allowed_in_frame=0&amp;search=foot |archivedate=2 August 2017 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
The "[p]lural form feet is an instance of i-mutation." &lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;

==Structure==
[[File:Baby-baby-feet-bed-325690.jpg|thumb|upright=1.5|The feet of a newborn [[infant]].]]
The human foot is a strong and complex mechanical structure containing 26 [[bone]]s, 33 [[Joint (anatomy)|joints]] (20 of which are actively articulated), and more than a hundred [[muscle]]s, [[tendon]]s, and [[ligament]]s.&lt;ref name="Podiatry-Channel"&gt;Podiatry Channel, ''Anatomy of the foot and ankle''&lt;/ref&gt; The joints of the foot are the [[ankle]] and [[subtalar joint]] and the [[interphalangeal articulations of the foot]]. An anthropometric study of 1197 North American adult Caucasian males (mean age 35.5 years) found that a man's foot length was 26.3&amp;nbsp;cm with a [[standard deviation]] of 1.2&amp;nbsp;cm.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Hawes MR, Sovak D |title=Quantitative morphology of the human foot in a North American population |journal=Ergonomics |volume=37 |issue=7 |pages=1213–26 |date=July 1994 |pmid=8050406 |doi= 10.1080/00140139408964899|url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The foot can be subdivided into the hindfoot, the midfoot, and the forefoot:

The ''hindfoot'' is composed of the [[Talus bone|talus]] (or ankle bone) and the [[calcaneus]] (or heel bone). The two long bones of the lower leg, the [[tibia]] and [[fibula]], are connected to the top of the talus to form the [[ankle]]. Connected to the talus at the [[subtalar joint]], the calcaneus, the largest bone of the foot, is cushioned underneath by a layer of fat.&lt;ref name="Podiatry-Channel" /&gt;

The five irregular bones of the ''midfoot'', the [[Cuboid bone|cuboid]], [[Navicular bone|navicular]], and three [[Cuneiform (anatomy)|cuneiform]] bones, form the [[arches of the foot]] which serves as a shock absorber. The midfoot is connected to the hind- and fore-foot by muscles and the [[plantar fascia]].&lt;ref name="Podiatry-Channel" /&gt;

The ''forefoot'' is composed of five toes and the corresponding five proximal long bones forming the [[metatarsus]]. Similar to the fingers of the hand, the bones of the toes are called [[Phalanx bones|phalanges]] and the [[big toe]] has two phalanges while the other four toes have three phalanges each. The joints between the phalanges are called [[interphalangeal articulations of foot|interphalangeal]] and those between the metatarsus and phalanges are called [[metatarsophalangeal joint|metatarsophalangeal]] (MTP).&lt;ref name="Podiatry-Channel" /&gt;

{{anchor|dorsum}}
Both the midfoot and forefoot constitute the ''dorsum'' (the area facing upwards while standing) and the ''planum'' (the area facing downwards while standing).

{{anchor|instep}}

The ''instep'' is the arched part of the top of the foot between the toes and the ankle.

=== Bones ===
[[File:Blausen 0411 FootAnatomy.png|thumb|upright|Illustration of bones in lower leg and foot.]]

* [[tibia]], [[fibula]]
* [[Tarsus (skeleton)|tarsus]] (7): [[Talus bone|talus]], [[calcaneus]], [[Cuneiform (anatomy)|cuneiformes]] (3), [[Cuboid bone|cuboid]], and [[Navicular bone|navicular]]
* [[metatarsus]] (5): [[First metatarsal bone|first]], [[Second metatarsal bone|second]], [[Third metatarsal bone|third]], [[Fourth metatarsal bone|fourth]], and [[fifth metatarsal bone]]
* [[Phalanges of the foot|phalanges]] (14)

There can be many [[sesamoid bone]]s near the metatarsophalangeal joints, although they are only regularly present in the distal portion of the [[first metatarsal bone]].&lt;ref name="Platzer-220"&gt;Platzer 2004, p. 220&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Arches ===
{{Main|Arches of the foot}}
The human foot has two [[Anatomical terms of location|longitudinal]] arches and a transverse arch maintained by the interlocking shapes of the foot bones, strong ligaments, and pulling muscles during activity. The slight mobility of these arches when weight is applied to and removed from the foot makes walking and running more economical in terms of energy. As can be examined in a footprint, the medial longitudinal arch curves above the ground. This arch stretches from the heel bone over the "keystone" ankle bone to the three medial metatarsals. In contrast, the lateral longitudinal arch is very low. With the cuboid serving as its keystone, it redistributes part of the weight to the calcaneus and the distal end of the fifth metatarsal. The two longitudinal arches serve as pillars for the transverse arch which run obliquely across the tarsometatarsal joints. Excessive strain on the tendons and ligaments of the feet can result in fallen arches or [[flat feet]].&lt;ref name="Marieb-Hoehn-244"&gt;Mareb-Hoehn 2007, pp. 244–45&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Muscles ===
The muscles acting on the foot can be classified into extrinsic muscles, those originating on the anterior or posterior aspect of the lower leg, and intrinsic muscles, originating on the dorsal (top) or plantar (base) aspects of the foot.

==== Extrinsic ====
[[File:Gray437.png|thumb|80px|Anterior leg muscles.]]
All muscles originating on the lower leg except the [[popliteus muscle]] are attached to the bones of the foot. The tibia and fibula and the interosseous membrane separate these muscles into anterior and posterior groups, in their turn subdivided into subgroups and layers.
&lt;ref name="Platzer-256"&gt;Platzer 2004, p. 256&lt;/ref&gt;

''Anterior group''

''Extensor group'': [[Tibialis anterior muscle|tibialis anterior]] originates on the proximal half of the tibia and the interosseous membrane and is inserted near the [[tarsometatarsal joint]] of the first digit. In the non-weight-bearing leg tibialis anterior flexes the foot dorsally and lift its medial edge ([[supination]]). In the weight-bearing leg it brings the leg towards the back of the foot, like in rapid walking. [[Extensor digitorum longus muscle|Extensor digitorum longus]] arises on the lateral tibial condyle and along the fibula to be inserted on the second to fifth digits and proximally on the fifth metatarsal. The extensor digitorum longus acts similar to the tibialis anterior except that it also dorsiflexes the digits. [[Extensor hallucis longus muscle|Extensor hallucis longus]] originates medially on the fibula and is inserted on the first digit. As the name implies it dorsiflexes the big toe and also acts on the ankle in the unstressed leg. In the weight-bearing leg it acts similar to the tibialis anterior.
&lt;ref name="Platzer-258"&gt;Platzer 2004, p. 258&lt;/ref&gt;

''Peroneal group'': [[Peroneus longus muscle|peroneus longus]] arises on the proximal aspect of the fibula and [[Peroneus brevis muscle|peroneus brevis]] below it on the same bone. Together, their tendons pass behind the lateral [[malleolus]]. Distally, peroneus longus crosses the plantar side of the foot to reach its insertion on the first tarsometatarsal joint, while peroneus brevis reaches the proximal part of the fifth metatarsal. These two muscles are the strongest pronators and aid in plantar flexion. Longus also acts like a bowstring that braces the transverse arch of the foot.
&lt;ref name="Platzer-260"&gt;Platzer 2004, p. 260&lt;/ref&gt;

{{double image|right|Gray438.png|100|Gray439.png|80|Deep and superficial layers of posterior leg muscles}}
''Posterior group''

The ''superficial layer'' of posterior leg muscles is formed by the [[triceps surae]] and the [[Plantaris muscle|plantaris]]. The triceps surae consists of the [[Soleus muscle|soleus]] and the two heads of the [[Gastrocnemius muscle|gastrocnemius]]. The heads of gastrocnemius arise on the [[femur]], proximal to the condyles, and soleus arises on the proximal dorsal parts of the tibia and fibula. The tendons of these muscles merge to be inserted onto the calcaneus as the [[Achilles tendon]]. Plantaris originates on the femur proximal to the lateral head of the gastrocnemius and its long tendon is embedded medially into the Achilles tendon. The triceps surae is the primary plantar flexor and its strength becomes most obvious during ballet dancing. It is fully activated only with the knee extended because the gastrocnemius is shortened during knee flexion. During walking it not only lifts the heel, but also flexes the knee, assisted by the plantaris.&lt;ref name="Platzer-262"&gt;Platzer 2004, p. 262&lt;/ref&gt;

In the ''deep layer'' of posterior muscles [[Tibialis posterior muscle|tibialis posterior]] arises proximally on the back of the interosseous membrane and adjoining bones and divides into two parts in the sole of the foot to attach to the tarsus. In the non-weight-bearing leg, it produces plantar flexion and supination, and, in the weight-bearing leg, it proximates the heel to the calf. [[Flexor hallucis longus muscle|flexor hallucis longus]] arises on the back of the fibula (i.e. on the lateral side), and its relatively thick muscle belly extends distally down to the [[flexor retinaculum of foot|flexor retinaculum]] where it passes over to the medial side to stretch across the sole to the distal phalanx of the first digit. The [[Popliteus muscle|popliteus]] is also part of this group, but, with its oblique course across the back of the knee, does not act on the foot.
&lt;ref name="Platzer-264"&gt;Platzer 2004, p. 264&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Intrinsic ====
On the ''back'' (top) ''of the foot'', the tendons of [[Extensor digitorum brevis muscle|extensor digitorum brevis]] and [[Extensor hallucis brevis muscle|extensor hallucis brevis]] lie deep to the system of long extrinsic extensor tendons. They both arise on the calcaneus and extend into the dorsal [[aponeurosis]] of digits one to four, just beyond the penultimate joints. They act to dorsiflex the digits.
&lt;ref name="Platzer-268"&gt;Platzer 2004, p. 268&lt;/ref&gt;

{{triple image|right|Gray443.png|83|Gray444.png|91|Gray445.png|100|Plantar aspects of foot, varying depths (superficial to deep)}}

Similar to the intrinsic muscles of the hand, there are three groups of muscles in the ''sole of foot'', those of the first and last digits, and a central group:

''Muscles of the [[Hallux|big toe]]'': [[Abductor hallucis muscle|abductor hallucis]] stretches medially along the border of the sole, from the calcaneus to the first digit. Below its tendon, the tendons of the long flexors pass through the [[Tarsal tunnel|tarsal canal]]. It is an abductor and a weak flexor, and also helps maintain the arch of the foot. [[Flexor hallucis brevis muscle|flexor hallucis brevis]] arises on the medial cuneiform bone and related ligaments and tendons. An important plantar flexor, it is crucial for ballet dancing. Both these muscles are inserted with two heads proximally and distally to the first metatarsophalangeal joint. [[Adductor hallucis muscle|Adductor hallucis]] is part of this group, though it originally formed a separate system (see [[contrahens]].) It has two heads, the oblique head originating obliquely across the central part of the midfoot, and the transverse head originating near the metatarsophalangeal joints of digits five to three. Both heads are inserted into the lateral sesamoid bone of the first digit. Adductor hallucis acts as a tensor of the plantar arches and also adducts the big toe and then might plantar flex the proximal phalanx.
&lt;ref name="Platzer-270"&gt;Platzer 2004, pp. 270–72&lt;/ref&gt;

''Muscles of the [[Fifth toe|little toe]]'': Stretching laterally from the calcaneus to the proximal phalanx of the fifth digit, [[Abductor digiti minimi muscle (foot)|abductor digiti minimi]] form the lateral margin of the foot and is the largest of the muscles of the fifth digit. Arising from the base of the fifth metatarsal, [[flexor digiti minimi brevis muscle (foot)|flexor digiti minimi]] is inserted together with abductor on the first phalanx. Often absent, [[Opponens digiti minimi muscle|opponens digiti minimi]] originates near the cuboid bone and is inserted on the fifth metatarsal bone. These three muscles act to support the arch of the foot and to plantar flex the fifth digit.
&lt;ref name="Platzer-272"&gt;Platzer 2004, p. 272&lt;/ref&gt;

{{double image|right|Gray446.png|100|Gray447.png|100|Central muscles of foot}}
''Central muscle group'': The four [[Lumbrical muscle (foot)|lumbricals]] arise on the medial side of the tendons of flexor digitorum longus and are inserted on the medial margins of the proximal phalanges. [[Quadratus plantae muscle|Quadratus plantae]] originates with two slips from the lateral and medial margins of the calcaneus and inserts into the lateral margin of the flexor digitorum tendon. It is also known as flexor accessorius. [[Flexor digitorum brevis muscle|Flexor digitorum brevis]] arise inferiorly on the calcaneus and its three tendons are inserted into the middle phalanges of digits two to four (sometimes also the fifth digit). These tendons divide before their insertions and the tendons of flexor digitorum longus pass through these divisions. Flexor digitorum brevis flexes the middle phalanges. It is occasionally absent. Between the toes, the [[Dorsal interossei muscles (foot)|dorsal]] and [[Plantar interossei muscles|plantar interossei]] stretch from the metatarsals to the proximal phalanges of digits two to five. The plantar interossei adducts and the dorsal interossei abducts these digits and are also plantar flexors at the metatarsophalangeal joints.

Due to their position and function, feet are exposed to a [[List of disorders of foot and ankle|variety]] of potential [[infection]]s and [[injuries]], including [[athlete's foot]], [[bunion]]s, [[Ingrown nail|ingrown toenails]], [[Morton's neuroma]], [[plantar fasciitis]], [[plantar wart]]s and [[stress fracture]]s. In addition, there are several [[genetic disorder]]s that can affect the shape and function of the feet, including a [[club foot]] or [[flat feet]].

This leaves humans more vulnerable to medical problems that are caused by poor leg and foot alignments. Also, the wearing of shoes, sneakers and boots can impede proper alignment and movement within the ankle and foot. For example, [[High-heeled footwear]] are known to throw off the [[neutral spine|natural weight balance]] (this can also affect the lower back). For the sake of posture, flat soles with no heels are advised.

A [[physician|doctor]] who specializes in the treatment of the feet practices [[podiatry]] and is called a podiatrist. A [[pedorthist]] specializes in the use and modification of footwear to treat problems related to the lower limbs.

{{anchor|fracture}}&lt;!--"Foot fracture" redirects here--&gt;
[[Bone fracture|Fracture]]s of the foot include:
*[[Lisfranc fracture]]&amp;nbsp;– in which one or all of the [[metatarsal]]s are displaced from the [[Tarsus (skeleton)|tarsus]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://medical-dictionary.thefreedictionary.com/Lisfranc%27s+fracture TheFreeDictionary &gt; Lisfranc's fracture] Citing: Mosby's Medical Dictionary, 8th edition. 2009&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Jones fracture]]&amp;nbsp;– a fracture of the [[fifth metatarsal]]
*[[March fracture]]&amp;nbsp;– a fracture of the distal third of one of the metatarsals occurring because of recurrent stress
*[[Calcaneal fracture]]

{{anchor|sweat}}&lt;!--"Foot sweat" redirects here--&gt;
Foot [[sweat]] is the major cause of [[foot odor]]. Sweat itself is odorless, but it creates a beneficial environment for certain bacteria to grow and produce bad-smelling substances.

==Pronation==
{{main|Pronation of the foot}}
In anatomy, [[pronation]] is a rotational movement of the forearm (at the radioulnar joint) or foot (at the subtalar and talocalcaneonavicular joints). Pronation of the foot refers to how the body distributes weight as it cycles through the [[gait]]. During the gait cycle the foot can pronate in many different ways based on rearfoot and forefoot function. Types of pronation include neutral pronation,  underpronation (supination), and overpronation.

;Neutral pronation
An individual who neutrally pronates initially strikes the ground on the [[Human Anatomical Terms#Anatomical directions|lateral]] side of the [[heel]]. As the individual transfers weight from the heel to the [[metatarsus]], the foot will roll in a [[Human Anatomical Terms#Anatomical directions|medial]] direction, such that the weight is distributed evenly across the metatarsus. In this stage of the gait, the [[knee]] will generally, but not always, track directly over the [[hallux]].

This rolling inwards motion as the foot progresses from heel to toe is the way that the body naturally absorbs shock. Neutral pronation is the most ideal, efficient type of gait when using a [[heel strike (gait)|heel strike]] gait; in a forefoot strike, the body absorbs shock instead via flexation of the foot.

;Overpronation
As with a neutral pronator, an individual who overpronates initially strikes the ground on the lateral side of the heel. As the individual transfers weight from the heel to the metatarsus, however, the foot will roll too far in a medial direction, such that the weight is distributed unevenly across the metatarsus, with excessive weight borne on the [[hallux]]. In this stage of the gait, the knee will generally, but not always, track inwards.

An overpronator does not absorb shock efficiently. Imagine someone jumping onto a diving board, but the board is so flimsy that when it is struck, it bends and allows the person to plunge straight down into the water instead of back into the air. Similarly, an overpronator's arches will collapse, or the ankles will roll inwards (or a combination of the two) as they cycle through the gait. An individual whose bone structure involves [[external rotation]] at the [[hip]], knee, or [[ankle]] will be more likely to overpronate than one whose bone structure has [[internal rotation]] or central alignment. An individual who overpronates tends to wear down their running shoes on the medial (inside) side of the shoe towards the toe area.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.runnersworld.com/running-shoes/overpronation-explained?page=single | work = Runner's World | date = 21 September 2001 | title = Overpronation, Explained | accessdate = 28 December 2012 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20130924213417/http://www.runnersworld.com/running-shoes/overpronation-explained?page=single | archivedate = 24 September 2013 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

When choosing a running or walking shoe, a person with overpronation can choose shoes that have good inside support—usually by strong material at the inside sole and arch of the shoe.  It is usually visible.  The inside support area is marked by strong greyish material to support the weight when a person lands on the outside foot and then roll onto the inside foot.

;Underpronation (supination)

[[File:Underpronation.jpg|thumb|Underpronation of foot]]
An individual who underpronates also initially strikes the ground on the lateral side of the heel. As the individual transfers weight from the heel to the metatarsus, the foot will not roll far enough in a medial direction. The weight is distributed unevenly across the metatarsus, with excessive weight borne on the [[fifth metatarsal]], towards the lateral side of the foot. In this stage of the gait, the knee will generally, but not always, track laterally of the [[hallux]].

Like an overpronator, an underpronator does not absorb shock efficiently&amp;nbsp;– but for the opposite reason. The underpronated foot is like a diving board that, instead of failing to spring someone in the air because it is too flimsy, fails to do so because it is too rigid. There is virtually no give. An underpronator's arches or ankles don't experience much motion as they cycle through the gait. An individual whose bone structure involves [[internal rotation]] at the hip, knee, or ankle will be more likely to underpronate than one whose bone structure has external rotation or central alignment. Usually&amp;nbsp;– but not always&amp;nbsp;– those who are [[bow-legged]] tend to underpronate.{{Citation needed|reason=some sources say instead that those who are bow-legged tend to overpronate|date=November 2013}} An individual who underpronates tends to wear down their running shoes on the lateral (outside) side of the shoe towards the rear of the shoe in the heel area.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.runnersworld.com/running-shoes/supination-explained?page=single | work = Runner's World | date = 21 September 2001 | title = Supination, Explained | accessdate = 28 December 2012 | deadurl = no | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20130917160412/http://www.runnersworld.com/running-shoes/supination-explained?page=single | archivedate = 17 September 2013 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Society and culture==
Humans usually wear [[shoe]]s or similar footwear for protection from hazards when walking outside. There are a number of contexts where it is considered inappropriate to wear shoes. Some people consider it rude to wear shoes into a house and a [[Māori people|Māori]] [[Marae]] should only be entered with bare feet.

[[Foot fetishism]] is the most common form of sexual fetish.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://abcnews.go.com/Health/rex-ryans-foot-video-not-necessarily-unhealthy/story?id=12467617 |title=Rex Ryan's Apparent Foot Fetish Not Necessarily Unhealthy |publisher=Abcnews.go.com |date=2010-12-23 |accessdate=2012-08-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.chaimedia.com/list/197.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-01-04 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120101215643/http://www.chaimedia.com/list/197.html |archivedate=2012-01-01 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other animals==
{{Main|Comparative foot morphology}}

A [[paw]] is the soft foot of a mammal, generally a quadruped, that has claws or nails (e.g., a cat or dog's paw). A hard foot is called a [[hoof]]. Depending on style of locomotion, animals can be classified as [[plantigrade]] (sole walking), [[digitigrade]] (toe walking), or [[unguligrade]] (nail walking).

The metatarsals are the bones that make up the main part of the foot in humans, and part of the leg in large animals or paw in smaller animals. The number of metatarsals are directly related to the mode of locomotion with many larger animals having their digits reduced to two ([[elk]], [[cow]], [[sheep]]) or one ([[horse]]). The metatarsal bones of feet and paws are tightly grouped compared to, most notably, the human hand where the thumb metacarpal diverges from the rest of the metacarpus.&lt;ref name="France-537"&gt;France 2008, p. 537&lt;/ref&gt;

==Metaphorical and cultural usage==
[[File:Study of a pair of feet crossed at the ankles RMG PY5986.tiff|thumb|Study of a pair of feet crossed, 1847, by Margaret Louisa Herschel, daughter of [[John Herschel]], from the [[Royal Museums Greenwich]]]]
The word "foot" is used to refer to a "...linear measure was in Old English (the exact length has varied over time), this being considered the length of a man's foot; a unit of measure used widely and anciently. In this sense the plural is often foot. The current inch and foot are implied from measurements in 12c." &lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;
The word "foot" also has a musical meaning; a "...metrical foot (late Old English, translating Latin pes, Greek pous in the same sense) is commonly taken to represent one rise and one fall of a foot: keeping time according to some, dancing according to others."&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;

The word "foot" was used in Middle English to mean "a person" (c. 1200).&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;
The expression "...to put one's best foot foremost first recorded 1849 (Shakespeare has the better foot before, 1596)".&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt; The expression to "...put one's foot in (one's) mouth "say something stupid" was first used in 1942.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt; The expression "put (one's) foot in something" meaning to "make a mess of it" was used in 1823.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;

The word "footloose" was first used in the 1690s, meaning "free to move the feet, unshackled"; the more "figurative sense of "free to act as one pleases" was first used in 1873.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt; Like "footloose", "flat-footed" at first had its obvious literal meaning (in 1600, it meant "with flat feet") but by 1912 it meant "unprepared" (U.S. baseball slang).&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3554">'''Forensic Economics''' as defined by the National Association of Forensic Economics is the scientific discipline that applies economic theories and methods to matters within a legal framework. Forensic economics covers, but is not limited to:
* The calculation of pecuniary damages in personal and commercial litigation.
* The analysis of liability, such as the statistical analysis of discrimination, the analysis of market power in antitrust disputes, and fraud detection.
* Other matters subject to legal review, such as public policy analysis, and business, property, and asset valuation.

In a 2012 paper by Eric Zitzewitz entitled “Forensic Economics,” ''Journal of Economic Literature'' 2012, 50(3), 731–769, published by the American Economic Association, "Forensic Economics" was defined as the application of economics to the detection and quantification of harm from behavior that has become the subject of litigation.

The only difference between these two definitions is that one suggests the application of science is itself a scientific discipline.  Notwithstanding this distinction, both definitions refer to the application of [[economics]].  While courts may dictate what economic issues are to be addressed, the economic science that is applied must be that which is taught and practiced in the world at large.

==Examples of applications of economics in litigation==
* Economic damages in injury and death
* Antitrust liability and economic damages
* Unfair practices in international trade
* Economic damages in copyright violation and patent infringement
* Contract violations
* Discrimination
* [[Economic damages]] related to physical and emotional abuse

'''Geophysics''' {{IPAc-en|dʒ|iː|oʊ|f|ɪ|z|ɪ|k|s}} is a subject of [[natural science]] concerned with the physical processes and physical properties of the [[Earth]] and its surrounding space environment, and the use of quantitative methods for their analysis. The term ''geophysics'' sometimes refers only to the geological applications: Earth's [[figure of the Earth|shape]]; its [[gravitational]] and [[Earth's magnetic field|magnetic fields]]; its [[structure of the Earth|internal structure]] and [[Earth#Composition|composition]]; its [[geodynamics|dynamics]] and their surface expression in [[plate tectonics]], the generation of [[magma]]s, [[volcanism]] and rock formation.&lt;ref name=Sheriff1991&gt;{{harvnb|Sheriff|1991}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, modern geophysics organizations use a broader definition that includes the [[water cycle]] including snow and ice; [[geophysical fluid dynamics|fluid dynamics]] of the oceans and the [[atmosphere]]; [[atmospheric electricity|electricity]] and [[magnetism]] in the [[ionosphere]] and [[magnetosphere]] and solar-terrestrial relations; and analogous problems associated with the [[Moon]] and other planets.&lt;ref name=Sheriff1991/&gt;&lt;ref name=IUGG&gt;{{harvnb|IUGG|2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=AGUscience&gt;{{harvnb|AGU|2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although geophysics was only recognized as a separate discipline in the 19th century, its origins date back to ancient times. The first magnetic compasses were made from [[lodestone]]s, while more modern magnetic compasses played an important role in the history of navigation. The first seismic instrument was built in 132 AD. [[Isaac Newton]] applied his theory of mechanics to the tides and the [[precession of the equinox]]; and instruments were developed to measure the Earth's shape, density and gravity field, as well as the components of the water cycle. In the 20th century, geophysical methods were developed for remote exploration of the solid Earth and the ocean, and geophysics played an essential role in the development of the theory of plate tectonics.

Geophysics is applied to societal needs, such as [[mineral resources]], mitigation of [[natural hazards]] and [[environmental protection]].&lt;ref name=IUGG/&gt;  In [[Exploration geophysics|Exploration Geophysics]], [[Geophysical survey]] data are used to analyze potential petroleum reservoirs and mineral deposits, locate groundwater, find archaeological relics, determine the thickness of glaciers and soils, and assess sites for environmental remediation.

== Physical phenomena ==
Geophysics is a highly interdisciplinary subject, and geophysicists contribute to every area of the [[Earth sciences]]. To provide a clearer idea of what constitutes geophysics, this section describes phenomena that are studied in [[physics]] and how they relate to the Earth and its surroundings.

=== Gravity ===
[[Image:Earth gravity.png|thumb|260px|A map of deviations in gravity from a perfectly smooth, idealized Earth.|alt=Image of globe combining color with topography.]]
{{Main|Gravity of Earth}}
{{further|Physical geodesy|Gravimetry}}
The gravitational pull of the Moon and Sun give rise to two high tides and two low tides every lunar day, or every 24 hours and 50 minutes. Therefore, there is a gap of 12 hours and 25 minutes between every high tide and between every low tide.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Ross|1995|pp=236–242}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Gravitational forces make rocks press down on deeper rocks, increasing their density as the depth increases.&lt;ref name=Poirier&gt;{{harvnb|Poirier|2000}}&lt;/ref&gt; Measurements of [[gravitational acceleration]] and [[gravitational potential]] at the Earth's surface and above it can be used to look for mineral deposits (see [[gravity anomaly]] and [[gravimetry]]).&lt;ref name=Telford/&gt; The surface gravitational field provides information on the dynamics of [[tectonic plates]]. The [[geopotential]] surface called the [[geoid]] is one definition of the shape of the Earth. The geoid would be the global mean sea level if the oceans were in equilibrium and could be extended through the continents (such as with very narrow canals).&lt;ref name=Lowrie/&gt;

=== Heat flow ===
{{Main|Geothermal gradient}}
[[Image:Convection-snapshot.gif|thumb|260px|A model of [[thermal convection]] in the [[Earth's mantle]]. The thin red columns are [[mantle plumes]]. |alt=Pseudocolor image in vertical profile.]]
The Earth is cooling, and the resulting [[heat flow]] generates the Earth's magnetic field through the [[geodynamo]] and plate tectonics through [[mantle convection]].&lt;ref name=Davies&gt;{{harvnb|Davies|2001}}&lt;/ref&gt; The main sources of heat are the primordial heat and [[radioactivity]], although there are also contributions from [[phase transitions]]. Heat is mostly carried to the surface by [[thermal convection]], although there are two thermal boundary layers – the [[core-mantle boundary]] and the [[lithosphere]] – in which heat is transported by [[Conduction (heat)|conduction]].&lt;ref name=Fowler&gt;{{harvnb|Fowler|2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some heat is carried up from the bottom of the [[Mantle (geology)|mantle]] by [[mantle plumes]]. The heat flow at the Earth's surface is about {{math| 4.2 &amp;times; 10&lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt; W}}, and it is a potential source of [[geothermal]] energy.&lt;ref name=Pollack&gt;{{harvnb|Pollack|Hurter|Johnson|1993}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Vibrations ===
{{Main|Seismology}}
[[Image:Pswaves.jpg|thumb|260px|Illustration of the deformations of a block by body waves and surface waves (see [[seismic wave]]). |alt=Deformed blocks with grids on surface.]]
[[Seismic wave]]s are vibrations that travel through the Earth's interior or along its surface. The entire Earth can also oscillate in forms that are called [[normal modes]] or [[seismic wave#Free oscillations of the Earth|free oscillations of the Earth]]. Ground motions from waves or normal modes are measured using [[seismograph]]s. If the waves come from a localized source such as an earthquake or explosion, measurements at more than one location can be used to locate the source. The locations of earthquakes provide information on plate tectonics and mantle convection.&lt;ref name=Shearer&gt;{{cite book|last=Shearer|first=Peter M.|title=Introduction to seismology|year=2009|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=Cambridge|isbn=9780521708425|edition=2nd}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Stein&gt;{{harvnb|Stein|Wysession|2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Measurements of seismic waves are a source of information on the region that the waves travel through. If the density or composition of the rock changes suddenly, some waves are reflected. [[Reflection seismology|Reflections]] can provide information on near-surface structure.&lt;ref name=Telford&gt;{{harvnb|Telford|Geldart|Sheriff|1990}}&lt;/ref&gt; Changes in the travel direction, called [[Seismic refraction|refraction]], can be used to infer the [[Earth's interior|deep structure of the Earth]].&lt;ref name=Stein/&gt;

Earthquakes pose a [[Earthquakes#Effects/impacts of earthquakes|risk to humans]]. Understanding their mechanisms, which depend on the type of earthquake (e.g., [[Intraplate earthquake|intraplate]] or [[Deep focus earthquake|deep focus]]), can lead to better estimates of earthquake risk and improvements in [[earthquake engineering]].&lt;ref name=Bozorgnia2004&gt;{{harvnb|Bozorgnia|Bertero|2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Electricity ===
Although we mainly notice electricity during [[thunderstorms]], there is always a downward electric field near the surface that averages 120 [[volt]]s per meter.&lt;ref name=Harrison&gt;{{harvnb|Harrison|Carslaw|2003}}&lt;/ref&gt; Relative to the solid Earth, the atmosphere has a net positive charge due to bombardment by [[cosmic rays]]. A current of about 1800 [[ampere]]s flows in the global circuit.&lt;ref name=Harrison/&gt; It flows downward from the ionosphere over most of the Earth and back upwards through thunderstorms. The flow is manifested by lightning below the clouds and [[sprite (lightning)|sprite]]s above.

A variety of electric methods are used in geophysical survey. Some measure [[spontaneous potential]], a potential that arises in the ground because of man-made or natural disturbances. [[Telluric current]]s flow in Earth and the oceans. They have two causes: [[electromagnetic induction]] by the time-varying, external-origin [[geomagnetic field]] and motion of conducting bodies (such as seawater) across the Earth's permanent magnetic field.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Lanzerotti|Gregori|1986}}&lt;/ref&gt; The distribution of telluric current density can be used to detect variations in [[electrical resistivity]] of underground structures. Geophysicists can also provide the electric current themselves (see [[induced polarization]] and [[electrical resistivity tomography]]).

=== Electromagnetic waves ===

[[Electromagnetic waves]] occur in the ionosphere and magnetosphere as well as the Earth's [[outer core]]. [[Dawn chorus (electromagnetic)|Dawn chorus]] is believed to be caused by high-energy electrons that get caught in the [[Van Allen radiation belt]]. [[Whistler (radio)|Whistlers]] are produced by [[lightning]] strikes. [[Hiss (electromagnetic)|Hiss]] may be generated by both. Electromagnetic waves may also be generated by earthquakes (see [[seismo-electromagnetics]]).

In the highly conductive liquid iron of the outer core, magnetic fields are generated by electric currents through electromagnetic induction. [[Alfvén wave]]s are [[magnetohydrodynamic]] waves in the magnetosphere or the Earth's core. In the core, they probably have little observable effect on the Earth's magnetic field, but slower waves such as magnetic [[Rossby wave]]s may be one source of [[geomagnetic secular variation]].&lt;ref name=Merrill/&gt;

Electromagnetic methods that are used for geophysical survey include [[transient electromagnetics]], [[magnetotellurics]] and electromagnetic seabed logging.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Stéphane |first1=Sainson |title=Electromagnetic seabed logging : a new tool for geoscientists |date=2017 |publisher=Springer |isbn=978-3-319-45355-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Magnetism ===
{{further|Earth's magnetic field|Aeromagnetic survey|Paleomagnetism}}
The Earth's magnetic field protects the Earth from the deadly [[solar wind]] and has long been used for navigation. It originates in the fluid motions of the outer core.&lt;ref name=Merrill/&gt; The magnetic field in the upper atmosphere gives rise to the [[Aurora (astronomy)|auroras]].&lt;ref name=Kivelson&gt;{{harvnb|Kivelson|Russell|1995}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Geomagnetisme.svg|thumb|left|200px|Earth's dipole axis (pink line) is tilted away from the rotational axis (blue line). |alt=Diagram with field lines, axes and magnet lines.]]
The Earth's field is roughly like a tilted [[dipole]], but it changes over time (a phenomenon called geomagnetic secular variation). Mostly the [[geomagnetic pole]] stays near the [[geographic pole]], but at random intervals averaging 440,000 to a million years or so, the polarity of the Earth's field reverses. These [[geomagnetic reversals]], analyzed within a [[Geomagnetic reversal#Geomagnetic polarity time scale|Geomagnetic Polarity Time Scale]], contain 184 polarity intervals in the last 83 million years, with change in frequency over time, with the most recent brief complete reversal of the [[Laschamp event]] occurring 41,000 years ago during the [[Glacial period#Last glacial period|last glacial period]]. Geologists observed [[Geomagnetic reversal#History|geomagnetic reversal recorded]] in volcanic rocks, through [[Magnetostratigraphy#Correlation and ages|magnetostratigraphy correlation]] (see [[natural remanent magnetization]]) and their signature can be seen as parallel linear magnetic anomaly stripes on the seafloor. These stripes provide quantitative information on [[seafloor spreading]], a part of plate tectonics. They are the basis of [[magnetostratigraphy]], which correlates magnetic reversals with other stratigraphies to construct geologic time scales.&lt;ref name=Opdyke&gt;{{harvnb|Opdyke|Channell|1996}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, the [[paleomagnetism|magnetization in rocks]] can be used to measure the motion of continents.&lt;ref name=Merrill/&gt;

=== Radioactivity ===
{{further|Radiometric dating}}
[[Image:Thorium decay chain from lead-212 to lead-208.svg|thumb|240px|Example of a radioactive decay chain (see [[Radiometric dating]]). |alt=Diagram with compound balls representing nuclei and arrows.]]
[[Radioactive decay]] accounts for about {{math|80%}} of the Earth's [[internal heat]], powering the geodynamo and plate tectonics.&lt;ref name=Turcotte&gt;{{harvnb|Turcotte|Schubert|2002}}&lt;/ref&gt; The main heat-producing [[isotopes]] are [[Potassium|potassium-40]], [[Uranium|uranium-238]], uranium-235, and [[Thorium|thorium-232]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Sanders|2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Radioactive elements are used for [[radiometric dating]], the primary method for establishing an absolute time scale in [[geochronology]].

Unstable isotopes decay at predictable rates, and the decay rates of different isotopes cover several orders of magnitude, so radioactive decay can be used to accurately date both recent events and events in past [[Era (geology)|geologic eras]].&lt;ref name=Renne&gt;{{harvnb|Renne|Ludwig|Karner|2000}}&lt;/ref&gt; Radiometric mapping using ground and airborne [[gamma spectrometry]] can be used to map the concentration and distribution of radioisotopes near the Earth's surface, which is useful for mapping lithology and alteration.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Radiometrics|url=http://www.ga.gov.au/scientific-topics/disciplines/geophysics/radiometrics|website=Geoscience Australia|publisher=Commonwealth of Australia|accessdate=23 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Interpreting radiometrics|url=http://spatial.agric.wa.gov.au/geophysics/radiometrics.asp|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120321102348/http://spatial.agric.wa.gov.au/geophysics/radiometrics.asp |archive-date=21 March 2012|website=Natural Resource Management|publisher=Department of Agriculture and Food, Government of Western Australia|accessdate=23 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Fluid dynamics ===
{{Main|Geophysical fluid dynamics}}
[[Fluid dynamics|Fluid motions]] occur in the magnetosphere, [[Earth's atmosphere|atmosphere]], ocean, mantle and core. Even the mantle, though it has an enormous [[viscosity]], flows like a fluid over long time intervals. This flow is reflected in phenomena such as [[isostasy]], [[post-glacial rebound]] and [[mantle plume]]s. The mantle flow drives plate tectonics and the flow in the Earth's core drives the geodynamo.&lt;ref name=Merrill/&gt;

Geophysical fluid dynamics is a primary tool in [[physical oceanography]] and [[meteorology]]. The rotation of the Earth has profound effects on the Earth's fluid dynamics, often due to the [[Coriolis effect]]. In the atmosphere it gives rise to large-scale patterns like [[Rossby waves]] and determines the basic circulation patterns of storms. In the ocean they drive large-scale circulation patterns as well as [[Kelvin waves]] and [[Ekman spirals]] at the ocean surface.&lt;ref name=Pedlosky&gt;{{harvnb|Pedlosky|1987}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the Earth's core, the circulation of the molten iron is structured by [[Taylor columns]].&lt;ref name=Merrill/&gt;

Waves and other phenomena in the magnetosphere can be modeled using [[magnetohydrodynamics]].

=== Mineral physics ===
{{further|Mineral physics}}
The physical properties of minerals must be understood to infer the composition of the Earth's interior from [[seismology]], the [[geothermal gradient]] and other sources of information. Mineral physicists study the [[elasticity (physics)|elastic]] properties of minerals; their high-pressure [[phase diagrams]], melting points and [[equations of state]] at high pressure; and the [[Rheology|rheological properties]] of rocks, or their ability to flow. Deformation of rocks by [[creep (deformation)|creep]] make flow possible, although over short times the rocks are brittle. The [[viscosity]] of rocks is affected by temperature and pressure, and in turn determines the rates at which tectonic plates move.&lt;ref name=Poirier/&gt;

Water is a very complex substance and its unique properties are essential for life.&lt;ref name=Sadava&gt;{{harvnb|Sadava|Heller|Hillis|Berenbaum|2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its physical properties shape the [[hydrosphere]] and are an essential part of the [[water cycle]] and [[climate]]. Its thermodynamic properties determine [[evaporation]] and the thermal gradient in the atmosphere. The many types of [[precipitation (meteorology)|precipitation]] involve a complex mixture of processes such as [[coalescence (physics)|coalescence]], [[supercooling]] and [[supersaturation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Sirvatka|2003}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some precipitated water becomes [[groundwater]], and groundwater flow includes phenomena such as [[percolation]], while the [[conductivity (electrolytic)|conductivity]] of water makes electrical and electromagnetic methods useful for tracking groundwater flow. Physical properties of water such as [[salinity]] have a large effect on its motion in the oceans.&lt;ref name=Pedlosky/&gt;

The many phases of ice form the [[cryosphere]] and come in forms like [[ice sheet]]s, [[glacier]]s, [[sea ice]], freshwater ice, snow, and frozen ground (or [[permafrost]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|CFG|2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Regions of the Earth ==

=== Size and form of the Earth ===
{{Main|Figure of the Earth}}
The Earth is roughly spherical, but it bulges towards the [[Equator]], so it is roughly in the shape of an ellipsoid (see [[Earth ellipsoid]]). This bulge is due to its rotation and is nearly consistent with an Earth in [[hydrostatic]] equilibrium. The detailed shape of the Earth, however, is also affected by the distribution of [[continents]] and [[ocean basins]], and to some extent by the dynamics of the plates.&lt;ref name=Lowrie/&gt;

=== Structure of the interior ===
{{Main|Structure of the Earth}}
[[Image:Earthquake wave paths.svg|thumb|260px|Seismic velocities and boundaries in the interior of the [[Earth]] sampled by seismic waves. |alt=Diagram with concentric shells and curved paths.]]
Evidence from seismology, heat flow at the surface, and [[mineral physics]] is combined with the Earth's mass and moment of inertia to infer models of the Earth's interior – its composition, density, temperature, pressure. For example, the Earth's mean [[specific gravity]] ({{math|5.515}}) is far higher than the typical specific gravity of rocks at the surface ({{math|2.7–3.3}}), implying that the deeper material is denser. This is also implied by its low [[moment of inertia]] ({{math| 0.33 &lt;var&gt;M R&lt;/var&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;}}, compared to {{math| 0.4 &lt;var&gt;M R&lt;/var&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;}} for a sphere of constant density). However, some of the density increase is compression under the enormous pressures inside the Earth. The effect of pressure can be calculated using the [[Adams–Williamson equation]]. The conclusion is that pressure alone cannot account for the increase in density. Instead, we know that the Earth's core is composed of an alloy of iron and other minerals.&lt;ref name=Poirier/&gt;

Reconstructions of seismic waves in the deep interior of the Earth show that there are no [[S-waves]] in the outer core. This indicates that the outer core is liquid, because liquids cannot support shear. The outer core is liquid, and the motion of this highly conductive fluid generates the Earth's field. The [[inner core]], however, is solid because of the enormous pressure.&lt;ref name=Lowrie&gt;{{harvnb|Lowrie|2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Reconstruction of seismic reflections in the deep interior indicate some major discontinuities in seismic velocities that demarcate the major zones of the Earth: inner core, outer core, mantle, lithosphere and [[crust (geology)|crust]]. The mantle itself is divided into the upper mantle, transition zone, lower mantle and ''D′′'' layer. Between the crust and the mantle is the [[Mohorovičić discontinuity]].&lt;ref name=Lowrie/&gt;

The seismic model of the Earth does not by itself determine the composition of the layers. For a complete model of the Earth, mineral physics is needed to interpret seismic velocities in terms of composition. The mineral properties are temperature-dependent, so the [[geotherm]] must also be determined. This requires physical theory for [[thermal conduction]] and [[convection]] and the heat contribution of [[radionuclides|radioactive elements]]. The main model for the radial structure of the interior of the Earth is the [[preliminary reference Earth model]] (PREM). Some parts of this model have been updated by recent findings in mineral physics (see [[post-perovskite]]) and supplemented by [[seismic tomography]]. The mantle is mainly composed of [[silicates]], and the boundaries between layers of the mantle are consistent with phase transitions.&lt;ref name=Poirier/&gt;

The mantle acts as a solid for seismic waves, but under high pressures and temperatures it deforms so that over millions of years it acts like a liquid. This makes [[plate tectonics]] possible.

=== Magnetosphere ===
{{Main|Magnetosphere}}
[[Image:Structure of the magnetosphere mod.svg|300px|thumb|Schematic of Earth's magnetosphere. The [[solar wind]] flows from left to right. |alt=Diagram with colored surfaces and lines.]]
If a planet's [[magnetic field]] is strong enough, its interaction with the solar wind forms a magnetosphere. Early [[space probe]]s mapped out the gross dimensions of the Earth's magnetic field, which extends about 10 [[Earth radii]] towards the Sun. The solar wind, a stream of charged particles, streams out and around the terrestrial magnetic field, and continues behind the [[Magnetotail|magnetic tail]], hundreds of Earth radii downstream. Inside the magnetosphere, there are relatively dense regions of solar wind particles called the Van Allen radiation belts.&lt;ref name=Kivelson/&gt;

== Methods ==

===Geodesy===
{{Main|Geodesy}}

Geophysical measurements are generally at a particular time and place. Accurate measurements of position, along with earth deformation and gravity, are the province of [[geodesy]]. While geodesy and geophysics are separate fields, the two are so closely connected that many scientific organizations such as the [[American Geophysical Union]], the [[Canadian Geophysical Union]] and the [[International Union of Geodesy and Geophysics]] encompass both.&lt;ref name=NRC&gt;{{harvnb|National Research Council (U.S.). Committee on Geodesy|1985}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Absolute positions are most frequently determined using the [[global positioning system]] (GPS). A three-dimensional position is calculated using messages from four or more visible satellites and referred to the [[GRS 80|1980 Geodetic Reference System]]. An alternative, [[astro-geodetic|optical astronomy]], combines astronomical coordinates and the local gravity vector to get geodetic coordinates. This method only provides the position in two coordinates and is more difficult to use than GPS. However, it is useful for measuring motions of the Earth such as [[nutation]] and [[Chandler wobble]]. Relative positions of two or more points can be determined using [[very-long-baseline interferometry]].&lt;ref name=NRC/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Defense Mapping Agency|1984}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Torge&gt;{{harvnb|Torge|2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Gravity measurements became part of geodesy because they were needed to related measurements at the surface of the Earth to the reference coordinate system. Gravity measurements on land can be made using [[gravimeters]] deployed either on the surface or in helicopter flyovers. Since the 1960s, the Earth's gravity field has been measured by analyzing the motion of satellites. Sea level can also be measured by satellites using [[Radar altimeter|radar altimetry]], contributing to a more accurate [[geoid]].&lt;ref name=NRC/&gt; In 2002, [[NASA]] launched the [[Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment]] (GRACE), wherein two twin satellites map variations in Earth's gravity field by making measurements of the distance between the two satellites using GPS and a microwave ranging system.  Gravity variations detected by GRACE include those caused by changes in ocean currents; runoff and ground water depletion; melting ice sheets and glaciers.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|CSR|2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Satellites and space probes===
Satellites in space have made it possible to collect data from not only the visible light region, but in other areas of the [[electromagnetic spectrum]]. The planets can be characterized by their force fields: gravity and their magnetic fields, which are studied through geophysics and space physics.

Measuring the changes in acceleration experienced by spacecraft as they orbit has allowed fine details of the [[gravity field]]s of the planets to be mapped. For example, in the 1970s, the gravity field disturbances above [[lunar maria]] were measured through [[Lunar Orbiter program|lunar orbiters]], which led to the discovery of concentrations of mass, [[mass concentration (astronomy)|mascons]], beneath the [[Mare Imbrium|Imbrium]], [[Mare Serenitatis|Serenitatis]], [[Mare Crisium|Crisium]], [[Mare Nectaris|Nectaris]] and [[Mare Humorum|Humorum]] basins.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Muller|Sjogren|1968}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
{{Main|History of geophysics}}
Geophysics emerged as a separate discipline only in the 19th century, from the intersection of [[physical geography]], [[geology]], [[astronomy]], meteorology, and physics.&lt;ref name=history_resources&gt;{{harvnb|Hardy|Goodman|2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Schröder|first=W.|title=History of geophysics|journal=Acta Geodaetica et Geophysica Hungarica|year=2010|volume=45|issue=2|pages=253–261|doi=10.1556/AGeod.45.2010.2.9}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, many geophysical phenomena – such as the Earth's magnetic field and earthquakes – have been investigated since the [[Ancient history|ancient era]].

=== Ancient and classical eras ===
[[Image:EastHanSeismograph.JPG|thumbnail|upright|Replica of [[Zhang Heng]]'s seismoscope, possibly the first contribution to [[seismology]]. |alt=Picture of ornate urn-like device with spouts in the shape of dragons]]
The magnetic compass existed in China back as far as the fourth century BC. It was used as much for [[feng shui]] as for navigation on land. It was not until good steel needles could be forged that compasses were used for navigation at sea; before that, they could not retain their magnetism long enough to be useful. The first mention of a compass in Europe was in 1190 AD.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Temple|2006|pp=162–166}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In circa 240 BC, [[Eratosthenes]] of Cyrene deduced that the Earth was round and measured the [[circumference of Earth|circumference of the Earth]], using trigonometry and the angle of the Sun at more than one latitude in Egypt. He developed a system of [[latitude]] and [[longitude]].&lt;ref name=Eratosthenes&gt;{{harvnb|Eratosthenes|2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Perhaps the earliest contribution to seismology was the invention of a [[seismoscope]] by the prolific inventor [[Zhang Heng]] in 132 AD.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Temple|2006|pp=177–181}}&lt;/ref&gt; This instrument was designed to drop a bronze ball from the mouth of a dragon into the mouth of a toad. By looking at which of eight toads had the ball, one could determine the direction of the earthquake. It was 1571 years before the first design for a seismoscope was published in Europe, by [[Jean de Hautefeuille|Jean de la Hautefeuille]]. It was never built.&lt;ref name=Dewey&gt;{{harvnb|Dewey|Byerly|1969}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Beginnings of modern science ===
One of the publications that marked the beginning of modern science was [[William Gilbert (astronomer)|William Gilbert]]'s ''[[De Magnete]]'' (1600), a report of a series of meticulous experiments in magnetism. Gilbert deduced that compasses point north because the Earth itself is magnetic.&lt;ref name=Merrill&gt;{{harvnb|Merrill|McElhinny|McFadden|1998}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1687 Isaac Newton published his ''[[Philosophiæ Naturalis Principia Mathematica|Principia]]'', which not only laid the foundations for [[classical mechanics]] and [[gravitation]] but also explained a variety of geophysical phenomena such as the [[tides]] and the precession of the equinox.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Newton|1999}} Section 3&lt;/ref&gt;

The first [[seismometer]], an instrument capable of keeping a continuous record of seismic activity, was built by [[James David Forbes|James Forbes]] in 1844.&lt;ref name=Dewey/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6278">'''Global Production Networks (GPN)''' is a concept in [[economic development|development]]al literature which refers to "the nexus of interconnected functions, operations and transactions through which a specific [[product (business)|product]] or [[Service (economics)|service]] is produced, [[Distribution (business)|distributed]] and [[Consumption (economics)|consumed]]."&lt;ref name=Coe/&gt;

== Global Production Networks ==
A [[globalization|global]] production network is one whose interconnected nodes and links extend spatially across national boundaries and, in so doing, integrates parts of disparate national and [[subnational]] territories".&lt;ref name=Coe&gt;{{citation|title=Global production networks: Realizing the potential|journal=Journal of Economic Geography|volume=8|issue=3|pages=271–295|year=2008|last1=Coe|first1=N. M.|last2=Dicken|first2=P.|last3=Hess|first3=M.|doi=10.1093/jeg/lbn002}}&lt;/ref&gt; GPN frameworks combines the insights from the [[global value chain]] analysis, [[actor–network theory]] and literature on [[Varieties of Capitalism]]. GPN provides a relational framework that aims to encompass all the relevant actors in the production systems. GPN framework provides analytical platform that relates sub-national regional development&lt;ref&gt;Coe NM, Hess M, Yeung H. W-C, Dicken P, Henderson J (2004) Globalizing regional development: a global production networks perspective. Transactions of the Institute of British Geographers 29:468–484.&lt;/ref&gt; with clustering dynamics.&lt;ref&gt;Harald Bathelt and Peng-Fei Li, “Global Cluster Networks—Foreign Direct Investment Flows from Canada to China,” Journal of Economic Geography 14, no. 1 (2014): 45–71.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Historical development of concept ==
In 1990s the concept of [[value chain]] gained its credit among economists and business scholars. (Its prominent developer [[Michael Porter]]). The concept combined sequenced and interconnected activities in the process of value creation. Value chain concept focused on business activities, but not on the corporate power and institutional context. In 1994 Garry Gereffi, together with Miguel Korzeniewicz introduced the concept of Global Commodity Chains (GCC):

{{quote|sets of interorganizational networks clustered around one commodity or product, linking households, enterprises, and states to one another within the world-economy. These networks are situationally specific, socially constructed, and locally integrated, underscoring the social embeddedness of economic organization|Gereffi&lt;ref&gt;Gereffi, G. (1994) ‘The organisation of buyer-driven global commodity chains: how US retailers shape overseas production networks’, in G. Gereffi and M. Korzeniewicz (eds), Commodity Chains and Global Development. Westport: Praeger, pp. 95–122: 2&lt;/ref&gt;}} The concept was developed further by a number of authors that emphasized importance of chain governance in different commodities (e.g. automobiles, textile, electronics etc.)

At the beginning of 2000s a group of authors Jeffrey Henderson, Peter Dicken, Martin Hess, Neil Coe and Henry Wai-Chung Yeung, introduced GPN framework, that builds on the development of previous approaches to international production processes. At the same time it expands beyond the linearity of GCC approach to incorporate all kinds of network configuration. Adopting clear network perspective allows to embrace the complexity of multidimensional layers of production moving beyond the "linear progression of the product or service"&lt;ref&gt;Neil M. Coe, Peter Dicken, and Martin Hess, “Global Production Networks: Realizing the Potential,” Journal of Economic Geography 8, no. 3 (May 1, 2008): 271–95, doi:10.1093/jeg/lbn002.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Insights from the analysis of production networks ==
Analysis of the global production networks relies on the use of the input-output tables that links firms through the transactions involved in the product creation. Commodity chain literature considers firms as the nodes in a number of chains that transform inputs into outputs through a series of interconnected stages of production, later linked to distribution and consumption activities. Andersen and Christensen define five major types of connective nodes in supply networks: Local integrator, Export base, Import base, International spanner and Global integrator &lt;ref&gt;Poul Houman Andersen and Poul Rind Christensen, “Bridges over Troubled Water: Suppliers as Connective Nodes in Global Supply Networks,” Journal of Business Research 58, no. 9 (September 2005): 1261–73, doi:10.1016/j.jbusres.2003.04.002.&lt;/ref&gt; Hobday et al. argue that the core capability of the firms stem from their ability to manage network of components and subsystem suppliers.&lt;ref&gt;Hobday, M., Davies, A., Prencipe, A. (2005) Systems integration: a core capability of the modern corporation. Industrial and Corporate Change, 14: 1109–1143.&lt;/ref&gt;

To capture both vertical and horizontal links across the sequence of production process, Lazzarini introduced the concept of Netchain: "a set of networks {{sic|comprised |hide=y|of}} horizontal ties between firms within a particular industry or group, which are sequentially arranged based on vertical ties between firms in different layers ... Netchain analysis explicitly differentiates between horizontal (transactions in the same layer) and vertical ties (transactions between layers), mapping how agents in each layer are related to each other and to agents in other layers".&lt;ref&gt;Lazzarini, S., Chaddad, F. R., Cook, M. L. (2000) Integrating supply chain and network analysis: the study of netchains. Journal on Chain and Network Science, 1: 7–22.&lt;/ref&gt; Critical studies have explored production networks in the domain of ethics of production, for instance focusing on local effects or labor relations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Miszczynski|first=M.|date=2016-02-18|title=Global Production in a Romanian Village: Middle-Income Economy, Industrial Dislocation and the Reserve Army of Labor|journal=Critical Sociology|volume=43|issue=7–8|pages=1079–1092|language=en|doi=10.1177/0896920515623076}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''hidden message''' is information that is not immediately noticeable, and that must be discovered or uncovered and interpreted before it can be known. Hidden messages include backwards audio messages, hidden visual messages and [[symbol]]ic or [[:wikt:cryptic|cryptic]] codes such as a [[Cryptic crossword|crossword]] or [[Encryption|cipher]]. Although there are many legitimate examples of hidden messages created with techniques such as [[backmasking]] and [[steganography]], many so-called hidden messages are merely [[Pareidolia|fanciful imaginings]] or [[apophany]].

== Description ==
The information in hidden messages is not immediately noticeable; it must be discovered or uncovered, and interpreted before it can be known. Hidden messages include [[Backmasking|backwards audio messages]], hidden visual messages, and [[symbol]]ic or [[:wikt:cryptic|cryptic]] [[code]]s such as a [[Cryptic crossword|crossword]] or [[Encryption|cipher]]. There are many legitimate examples of hidden messages, though many are imaginings.

== Backward audio messages ==
A backward message in an audio recording is only fully apparent when the recording is played reversed. Some backward messages are produced by deliberate [[backmasking]], while others are simply [[phonetic reversal]]s resulting from random combinations of words. Backward messages may occur in various mediums, including music, [[video game]]s, [[music video]]s, [[movies]], and [[television show]]s.

=== Backmasking ===
{{Main|Backmasking}}
Backmasking is a [[sound recording and reproduction|recording]] technique in which a message is recorded backwards onto a track that is meant to be played forwards. It was popularized by [[The Beatles]], who used backward vocals and instrumentation on their 1966 album ''[[Revolver (Beatles album)|Revolver]].'' The technique has also been used to censor words or phrases for "clean" releases of songs{{Citation needed|date=April 2008}}.

Backmasking has been a controversial topic in the United States since the 1980s, when allegations of its use for Satanic purposes were made against prominent [[rock music]]ians, leading to [[Book burning|record-burnings]] and proposed anti-backmasking legislation by state and federal governments. In debate are both the existence of backmasked Satanic messages and their purported ability to subliminally affect listeners.{{Citation needed|date=October 2016}}

=== Phonetic reversal ===
{{Main|Phonetic reversal}}

Certain phrases produce a different phrase when their [[phoneme]]s are reversed—a process known as phonetic reversal. For example, "Kiss" backwards sounds like "sick", and so the title of [[Yoko Ono]]'s "[[Kiss Kiss Kiss (Yoko Ono song)|Kiss Kiss Kiss]]" sounds like "Sick Sick Sick" or "Six Six Six" backwards. [[Queen (band)|Queen]]'s "[[Another One Bites the Dust]]"&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; backwards was claimed that the chorus, when played in reverse, can be heard as "It's fun to smoke marijuana"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine|first1= N. |last1= Epley |first2= B. |last2= Keysar |first3= L. |last3= Van Boven |first4= T. |last4= Gilovich |title= Perspective Taking as Egocentric Anchoring and Adjustment |journal= Journal of Personality and Social Psychology |volume= 87 |issue= 3 |pages= 327–339 |year= 2004 |pmid= 15382983 |doi= 10.1037/0022-3514.87.3.327}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dangerousminds.net/comments/its_fun_to_smoke_dust_satanic_panic_preacher_gets_mashed-up_with_queen|title= It's Fun To Smoke Dust! Satanic Panic Preacher Gets Mashed-Up With Queen|first=Christopher|last=Bickel|publisher=Dangerous Minds|date=January 20, 2017|accessdate=May 1, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; or "start to smoke marijuana".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first= Arthur |last= Goldstuck |title= The Rabbit in the Thorn Tree: Modern Myths and Urban Legends of South Africa |year= 1991 |page= 87 |publisher= Penguin Group |url= https://books.google.com/?id=3ZTfAAAAMAAJ |isbn= 0140148078}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Paul is dead]] phenomenon was started in part because a phonetic reversal of "Number nine" (the words were constantly repeated in ''[[Revolution 9]])'' was interpreted as "Turn me on, dead man".

According to proponents of [[reverse speech]], phonetic reversal occurs unknowingly during normal speech.

== Visual messages ==
Hidden messages can be created in visual mediums with techniques such as [[hidden text]] and [[steganography]].

In the 1980s, Coca-Cola released in South Australia an advertising poster featuring the reintroduced contour bottle, with a speech bubble, "Feel the Curves!!" An image hidden inside one of the ice cubes was controversial.&lt;ref name="snopes"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.snopes.com/cokelore/poster.asp|title=Risque Coca-Cola Poster|publisher=Snopes|date=14 May 2011|accessdate=31 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thousands of posters were distributed to hotels and bottle shops in Australia before the mistake was discovered by Coca-Cola management. The artist of the poster was fired and all the posters were recalled.&lt;ref name="snopes" /&gt;

Various other messages have been claimed to exist in Disney movies, some of them risque, such as the well-known allegation of an erection showing on a priest in ''[[The Little Mermaid]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.snopes.com/disney/films/films.asp Urban Legends Reference Pages: Disney (Disney Films)&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; According to the Snopes website, however, only one image "is clearly true [and] undeniably purposely inserted into the movie": images of a topless woman in two frames of ''[[The Rescuers]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.snopes.com/disney/films/rescuers.htm 'The Rescuers' Topless Scene : snopes.com&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[PETA]] (People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals) had an antipathy towards [[PETCO]], a pet food retailer in San Diego, regarding the purported mistreatment of live animals at their stores. When the [[San Diego Padres]] baseball team announced that the retailer had purchased [[naming rights]] to [[Petco Park]] stadium, PETA was unable to persuade the sports team to terminate the agreement. Later, PETA successfully purchased a commemorative display brick with what appears to be a complimentary message: "Break Open Your Cold Ones! Toast The Padres! Enjoy This Championship Organization!" However, if one takes the first letters of each word, the resulting [[acrostic]] reads "BOYCOTT PETCO". Neither PETCO nor the Padres have taken any action to remove the brick, stating that if someone walked by, they would not know it had anything to do with the PETA/PETCO feud.&lt;ref&gt;[http://sports.espn.go.com/espn/sportsbusiness/news/story?id=1783769 Rovell, Darren "Secret Message Makes it Into New Park" ESPN.com 4/16/2004]&lt;/ref&gt;

Web. 24 Oct. 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;   The spectrum provides the idea that sexuality/identity is loosely identifiable by specific means or measurements. The human sexuality spectrum contradicts sexuality binaries.

Sexuality and gender roles have primarily been based on biological and anatomical basis. Gender is generally legally based on the sex organs that the individual has, in most countries of the world if not all. Under the human sexuality spectrum system, sexuality and gender roles are found on the spectrum, the spectrum accounts for any minor variations that can be found in any given person. This system is found to be useful for many who do not like to be limited to a label. Many people find themselves deviating from a strict label. The pressure to place a label on a person’s sexual or gender preferences causes stress for the person who may not fit on one of societies provided labels.

It cannot be certain if people sit on one point of the spectrum their entire life or if they move over time. Research does suggest that sexuality can move along the spectrum at any given point in a person’s lifetime.{{Citation needed|date=November 2017}} The idea or hypothesis of sexual fluidity accounts for this.

==Commonly labeled sexualities==
[[Heterosexuality]] - The attraction of a person to only people of the opposite gender. This is commonly labelled as “straight”.

[[Bisexuality]] - The attraction of a person to two or more genders. Usually, but not necessarily, both female and male. Attraction to each gender is not necessarily always equal. 

[[Homosexuality]] - The attraction of a person to only people of the same gender. There are different labels for males and females who identify with this term.

[[Gay]] - Same as above, although usually used for men.

[[Lesbian]] - Females with an attraction to only the same gender.

[[Queer]] - umbrella term for someone whom belongs in neither of the binary genders. (See ‘non-binary’)

[[Asexuality|Asexual]] - Someone who has no sexual attraction towards any particular gender or group. 

[[Aromantic]] - Someone who does not experience romantic love or attraction. 

[[Pansexual]] - Someone who is attracted to people regardless of their gender, attraction to all genders. Can also be known as omnisexual.

[[Polysexual]] - Someone who is attracted to more than one gender and/or form of gender expression, but not all.

==Kinsey scale==
A heterosexual to homosexual rating scale produced by [[Alfred Kinsey]] along with his colleagues Wardell Pomeroy and Clyde Martin in 1948. The scale was developed as part of a theory that people did not necessarily only fit in an extreme view of the heterosexual or homosexual sexuality binary. 
The scale ranges on a 0-6 scale from exclusively heterosexual (0) to exclusively homosexual (6) with five steps in between. The chart is a basic scale depicting sexuality solely based on male and female attractions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://kinseyinstitute.org/research/publications/kinsey-scale.php|title=Prevalance of Homosexuality study|website=kinseyinstitute.org|access-date=2017-03-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The problem with the [[Kinsey scale]] is that it does not account for a lot of the sexualities that fall under the idea of queer nor does it account for gender identities. The scale is extremely linear with only a limited number of systematic steps and it only has two extremes. The scale is also based on a self-evaluation which is indefinite and subject to change over time. Because of this, Kinsey believed that we should develop a way to assign a position on the scale at each point in the person’s life.
The human sexuality spectrum is more effective in how it depicts smoother transitions in between sexualities. The human sexuality spectrum can also include gender roles. The Kinsey scale has the human sexuality spectrum beat in how it provides a numerical scale for its users. The Kinsey scale provides measurable data which the human sexuality spectrum is not able to do.

==Idea / theory of sexual fluidity==
Sexuality lies on a spectrum but the theory of sexual fluidity allows for the idea of variation over time. Kinsey supported this by finding evidence in his research that people seem to find their sexuality can change over time. The idea of sexual fluidity is that sexuality does not necessarily stay in one place on the spectrum. It can vary over time depending on situations. Someone’s perceived sexuality may not always fit who the person ends up being attracted to. Sexuality can bend and flow and end up surprising a person. The idea of sexual fluidity is a theory though as there is no way to prove sexuality is fluid. What can be said is that there is research based evidence of people deviating from their perceived sexuality. This supports the idea of the human sexuality spectrum as it provides evidence that sexuality does not necessarily fit on an extreme but can be found at any point in between. It is impossible to prove whether the person’s sexuality changed or if their sexuality was different than they thought all along. This theory suggests that not all gay people are born gay.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6872">'''K'àak' Chi'''' (“Mouth of Fire”) is a hypothetical [[archaeological site]] of the [[pre-Columbian]] [[Maya civilization]], proposed by William Gadoury of [[Saint-Jean-de-Matha, Quebec]] in 2016.&lt;ref name=JdM&gt;[http://www.journaldemontreal.com/2016/05/07/un-ado-decouvre-une-cite-maya "Un ado découvre une cité maya", 7 May 2016], ''[[Journal de Montreal]]''. Retrieved 10 May 2016 ('''French''')&lt;/ref&gt; It is located in the state of [[Campeche]] in southern Mexico, in the extreme south of the [[Yucatán Peninsula]]. The location was determined by overlaying Maya constellations with a map of the Yucatán Peninsula. 

The alleged site has caused controversy as [[Mayanist]] scholars have cast doubt upon the potential discovery.

== Remote prediction ==
The hypothetical discovery is based on analysis by the [[Canadian Space Agency]] of satellite data from [[NASA]], and from the Japanese Space Agency, [[JAXA]].&lt;!-- Which satellites have been used? Any sources saying that the CSA did the analysis? --&gt; The position of the site was posited by 15-year old William Gadoury based on his theory that Maya site locations correlated with [[Maya astronomy|their astronomical data]] matching 117 known Maya sites with the positions of stars in 22 supposed [[Maya astronomy|"Maya constellations"]]. K'àak' Chi lies at a location suggested by a supposed 23rd constellation (containing three stars) with only two known sites corresponding on the ground. However, the density of Maya cities in the region is such that the supposed alignment of Maya sites with the constellations has been attributed to coincidence.&lt;ref name="Wired 100516"&gt;Zhang, Sarah ''[https://www.wired.com/2016/05/long-lost-mayan-city-teen-found-isnt-lost-city/ That long-lost Mayan city a teen found isn't lost...Or a city]'' ''Wired'' magazine online. 10 May 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;

Gadoury reported that his study was sparked by reading the [[Mayan doomsday prophesies]] in 2012:
{{blockquote|I did not understand why the Maya built their cities away from rivers, on marginal lands and in the mountains... They had to have another reason, and as they worshipped the stars, the idea came to me to verify my hypothesis... I was really surprised and excited when I realised that the most brilliant stars of the constellations matched the largest Maya cities.&lt;ref name="NZ Herald"&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/world/news/article.cfm?c_id=2&amp;objectid=11636868 | title=Boy, 15, discovers long-lost ancient Mayan city using constellations and Google Earth | work=[[NZ Herald News]] | date=May 10, 2016 | agency=[[news.com.au]] | accessdate=May 11, 2016 | author=McMah, Lauren}}&lt;/ref&gt;|William Gadoury}}

==Archeological exploration==
Mayanist Geoffrey Braswell pointed out that he had been working in the area pinpointed by Gadoury, and confirmed that the area was in fact fields and seasonal swamps.&lt;ref name="Wired 100516"/&gt; Archaeologist [[Richard D. Hansen|Richard Hansen]] noted that the location is also very close to the Maya ruins of [[Uxul]], which have been the subject of archaeological investigation since 2009.&lt;ref name="Wired 100516"/&gt; Mexican archaeologist Rafael Cobos Palma pointed out that the area of the supposed discovery has been extensively explored by archaeologists since the 1930s, and was very close to various already-identified Maya sites in southern Campeche.&lt;ref name="Verne"&gt;Cruz, Mónica; and Abril Mulato, [http://verne.elpais.com/verne/2016/05/10/mexico/1462838532_810585.html Las dudas de los expertos ante la ciudad maya ‘descubierta’ por un quinceañero canadiense] ''[[El País]]: Verne'' 10 May 2016. Retrieved 19 May 2016. {{es icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Doubts cast on the find==

The [[Instituto Nacional de Antropología e Historia]] (INAH) (National Institute of Anthropology and History) in Mexico said it was not even “considering” the alleged find, since “there is no scientific basis for it”.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.efe.com/efe/english/technology/mexico-casts-doubt-on-discovery-of-ancient-maya-city-by-canadian-teen/50000267-2923295&lt;/ref&gt;

Mayanist [[David Stuart (Mayanist)|David Stuart]] cast doubt upon the discovery, describing it as an example of "junk science", and identified the object on satellite imagery as an old cornfield, or ''[[milpa]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.smh.com.au/technology/sci-tech/canadian-teen-william-gadourys-discovery-of-mayan-city-debunked-as-junk-science-20160511-gosa26.html Canadian teen William Gadoury's discovery of 'Mayan city' debunked as junk science]''Sydney Morning Herald'' 11 May 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; Mayanist Geoffrey Braswell of the [[University of California]] stated that the object is definitely not a [[Mesoamerican pyramids|Maya pyramid]], and identified the imagery as either an abandoned ''milpa'' or an active [[marijuana]] field.&lt;ref&gt;McCrum and Hamill [https://www.mirror.co.uk/tech/lost-mayan-city-discovered-jungle-7952131 'Lost Mayan city' discovered in the jungle could be a WEED FARM, archaeologist claims] ''Daily Mirror'' 12 May 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;

In a response to the alleged discovery, anthropologist and astronomer [[Anthony Aveni]] stated that trying to correlate a direct correspondence between a star map and a large quantity of man-made features is "an act of creative imagination."&lt;ref name="NG110516"&gt;Romey, Kristin [http://news.nationalgeographic.com/2016/05/20160511-Maya-Lost-City-Canadian-Teen-Discover-Constellations-Archaeology-Satellite-Stars-Gadoury/ Experts: Teen's 'Discovery' of Maya City is a Very Western Mistake: Why modern astronomical maps may not lead us to ancient sites.], ''National Geographic'' online, 11 May 2016&lt;/ref&gt; Aveni has pointed out that there are several competing theories as to what the 13 Maya zodiacal constellations represent, and how they are arranged.&lt;ref name="NG110516"/&gt;

Mayanist Francisco Estrada-Belli has pointed out that even should a Maya site be located in the predicted place, it could be down to coincidence since there are likely to be hundreds of undiscovered Maya archaeological sites; he commented that the chances were very good of putting a finger anywhere on a map of the region and pinpointing a Maya site. He also offered an invitation for Gadoury to come to Mexico with him to look for Mayan sites.&lt;ref name="NG110516"/&gt;

Armand LaRocque of the [[remote sensing]] laboratory of the [[University of New Brunswick]] is reported as saying while satellite imagery might indicate a pyramid and building, anomalies identified  in the satellite imagery needed further study and were not definitely man-made.&lt;ref name="NG110516"/&gt;

'''Kashinhou''' (化審法), short for {{nihongo|化学物質の審査及び製造等の規制に関する法律|Kagaku Busshitsu no Shinsa Oyobi Seizoutou no Kisei ni Kansuru Houritsu}}, ("Law Concerning the Examination and Regulation of Manufacture, etc. of Chemical Substances") (Showa Act No. 117, 昭和48年法律第117号) is the current Chemicals and dangerous substances regulation law in Japan.  The more concise abbreviated name is {{nihongo|化学物質審査規制法|Kagaku Busshitsu Shinsa Kiseihou}}, or "Chemical Substances Control Law". This law featured the world's first new chemical pre-examination system.

== Coverage ==
This law was established to provide a framework to examine the import, manufacture, and use of industrial chemicals and refractory organic substances for persistence and health consequences, as well as the necessary legal restrictions in order to achieve those aims.

== History ==
The law has its origins in 1968, with an illness related to [[polychlorinated biphenyls]] poisoning in the [[Kanemi Oil Incident]]. In 1973, this law was established, radically overturning a prevailing attitude that long term contaminants bioaccumulating in humans was not problematic. Refractory organic substances, highly enriched uranium, and substances that possess long term toxicity to humans were classified as Section 1 Chemical Substances. Section 1 items were banned from manufacture or importation.

In 1986, a Section 2 Chemical Substances was added, which included [[trichloroethylene]] and [[tetrachloroethylene]], which had contaminated groundwater. Questionable chemical substances that did not fall into above categories were introduced into a Section 2 Questionable Chemical substances category.

In 1999, the government ministries were reorganized, and the [[Ministry of the Environment (Japan)|Ministry of the Environment]] was added as an overseer to the precursor ministries of the current [[Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare]], [[Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry]].

In 2003, under pressure from the [[Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development]], a third Section was created to surveillance of chemical substances harmful to flora and fauna but not to humans.

Regulation, policing, and surveillance of other laws, namely the Poisonous and Deleterious Substance Control Law, Stimulant Control Law, and Narcotics and Psychotropics Control Law were transferred to the current ministries as mentioned above.

A '''mass deficit''' is the amount of mass (in stars) that has been removed from the center of a [[galaxy]], presumably by the action of a [[binary star|binary]] [[supermassive black hole]].

[[File:mdef.jpg|thumb|left|The figure illustrates how mass deficits are measured, using the observed brightness profile of a galaxy]]

The density of stars increases toward the center in most galaxies. In small galaxies, this increase continues into the very center. In large galaxies, there is usually a "core", a region near the center where the density is constant or slowly rising. The size of the core – the "core radius" – can be a few hundred [[parsec]]s in large [[elliptical galaxy|elliptical galaxies]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Ferrarese |first=Laura |display-authors=etal |editor-first=Vladimir|editor-last=Karas |editor2-first=Giorgio |editor2-last=Matt |title=Black Holes: from Stars to Galaxies|publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]] |date=2007 |pages= 261–268|chapter=The Inner Workings of Early-Type Galaxies: Cores, Nuclei and Supermassive Black Holes |isbn=978-0-521-86347-6 |chapter-url=http://www.cambridge.org/gb/knowledge/isbn/item1173713/?site_locale=en_GB}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Dullo, Bililign T.; Graham, Alister W.

It is believed that cores are produced by binary supermassive black holes (SMBHs). Binary SMBHs form during the [[galaxy merger|merger of two galaxies]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last= Begelman |first= M. C. |title= Massive black hole binaries in active galactic nuclei |journal= Nature |volume= 287 |issue= 5780|pages= 307–309 |date= 1980 |doi= 10.1038/287307a0|bibcode= 1980Natur.287..307B |display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; If a star passes near the massive binary, it will be ejected, by a process called the [[gravitational slingshot]]. This ejection continues until most of the stars near the center of the galaxy have been removed. The result is a low-density core. Such cores are ubiquitous in giant elliptical galaxies.

The mass deficit is defined&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last= Milosavljevic |first= Milos |author-link= |last2= Merritt |first2= David |author2-link= David Merritt |last3= Rest |first3= Armin |last4= van den Bosch |first4= Frank |title= Galaxy cores as relics of black hole mergers |journal= [[Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society]] |volume= 331 |issue= 4 |pages= L51–L55 |date= 2002 |doi= 10.1046/j.1365-8711.2002.05436.x|arxiv= astro-ph/0110185 |bibcode= 2002MNRAS.331L..51M}}&lt;/ref&gt; as the amount of mass that was removed in creating the core. Mathematically, the mass deficit is defined as
:&lt;math&gt;M_\mathrm{def}= 4\pi\int_0^{R_c} \left[\rho_i(r) - \rho(r) \right]r^2 dr&lt;/math&gt;,

where ''ρ''&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; is the original density, ''ρ'' is the observed density, and ''R''&lt;sub&gt;c&lt;/sub&gt; is the core radius.  In practice, the [[core-Sersic model]] can be used to help quantify the deficits.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last= Graham |first= Alister |title= Core Depletion from Coalescing Supermassive Black Holes |journal= The Astrophysical Journal Letters |volume= 613 |issue= 1 |pages= L33–L36 |date= 2004 |url= http://iopscience.iop.org/1538-4357/613/1/L33/ |doi= 10.1086/424928 |bibcode=2004ApJ...613L..33G|arxiv= astro-ph/0503177}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Observed mass deficits are typically in the range of one to a few times the mass of the central SMBH,&lt;ref name=DEGN&gt;{{cite book|last=Merritt|first=David|author-link=David Merritt|title=Dynamics and Evolution of Galactic Nuclei|date=2013|publisher=[[Princeton University Press]]|location=Princeton, NJ|isbn=9781400846122|url=http://openlibrary.org/works/OL16802359W/Dynamics_and_Evolution_of_Galactic_Nuclei}}&lt;/ref&gt; and observed core radii are comparable to the [[sphere of influence (black hole)|influence radii]] of the central SMBH. These properties are consistent with what is predicted in theoretical models of core formation &lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last= Merritt |first= David |author-link= David Merritt |title= Mass Deficits, Stalling Radii, and the Merger Histories of Elliptical Galaxies |journal= The Astrophysical Journal |volume= 648 |issue= 2|pages= 976–986 |date= 2006 |url= http://iopscience.iop.org/0004-637X/648/2/976/ |doi= 10.1086/506139 |bibcode=2006ApJ...648..976M|arxiv= astro-ph/0603439}}&lt;/ref&gt; and lend support to the hypothesis that all bright galaxies once contained binary SMBHs at their centers.

It is not known whether most galaxies still contain massive binaries, or whether the two black holes have coalesced. Both possibilities are consistent with the presence of mass deficits.

'''Multimedia Broadcast Multicast Services''' ('''MBMS''') is a [[point-to-multipoint]] interface specification for existing and upcoming [[3GPP]] [[cellular network]]s, which is designed to provide efficient delivery of [[broadcast]] and [[multicast]] [[service (economics)|service]]s, both within a cell as well as within the [[core network]]. For broadcast transmission across multiple cells, it defines transmission via [[single-frequency network]] configurations. The specification is referred to as Evolved Multimedia Broadcast Multicast Services (eMBMS) when transmissions are delivered through an [[LTE (telecommunication)|LTE (Long Term Evolution)]] network. eMBMS is also known as LTE Broadcast.

Target applications include [[mobile TV]] and radio broadcasting, live streaming video services, as well as file delivery and emergency alerts.

Questions remain whether the technology is an optimization tool for the operator or if an operator can generate new revenues with it. Several studies have been published on the domain identifying both cost savings and new revenues.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.expway.com/wp-content/uploads/White-Paper-14-LTE-Broadcast-Use-Cases-final.pdf An Analysis of 14 Different LTE Broadcast Business Cases]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Deployments ==
In 2013,&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.pcmag.com/article2/0,2817,2414062,00.asp Verizon Eyes Broadcast Over LTE for Super Bowl 2014] By Chloe Albanesius, PC Magazine, January 8, 2013&lt;/ref&gt; [[Verizon]] announced that it would launch eMBMS services in 2014, over its nationwide (United States) [[LTE (telecommunication)|LTE]] networks. [[AT&amp;T]] subsequently announced plans to use the 700&amp;nbsp;MHz Lower D and E Block licenses it acquired in 2011 from [[Qualcomm]] for an LTE Broadcast service.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fiercewireless.com/story/att-use-lower-700-mhz-d-and-e-block-spectrum-lte-broadcast/2013-09-24#ixzz2p5gWKi16 AT&amp;T to use Lower 700 MHz D and E Block spectrum for LTE Broadcast] By Phil Goldstein, FierceWireless, September 24, 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

Several major operators worldwide have been lining-up to deploy and test the technology. The frontrunners being Verizon in the United States,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.verizonwireless.com/news/article/2014/05/verizon-wireless-lte-multicast.html Verizon Delivers LTE Multicast Over Commercial 4G LTE Network in Indy]&lt;/ref&gt; [[KT Corporation|Kt]] and [[Jio|Reliance]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tele.net.in/view-point/item/15556-rjil-to-invest-in-lte-broadcast-technology-says-market-status-report-by-gsa RJIL to invest in LTE broadcast technology]&lt;/ref&gt; in [[Asia]], and recently [[EE Limited|EE]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.totaltele.com/view.aspx?ID=490119]&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Vodafone]] in [[Europe]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.thebroadcastbridge.com/content/entry/3206/europe-charges-ahead-with-lte-broadcast-trials]&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 2014, Korea’s Kt launched the first commercial LTE Broadcast service.&lt;ref&gt;http://telecoms.com/217182/koreas-kt-launches-lte-broadcast-service/&lt;/ref&gt; The solution includes Kt’s internally developed eMBMS Bearer Service, and [[Samsung]] mobile devices fitted with the Expway Middleware as the eMBMS User Service.

In February 2014, Verizon demonstrated the potential of LTE Broadcast during [[Super Bowl XLVIII]], using [[Samsung Galaxy Note 3]]s, fitted with Expway's eMBMS User Service.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cnet.com/news/verizon-uses-super-bowl-to-show-off-lte-broadcast-video/]&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 2014, [[Nokia]] demonstrated the use of LTE Broadcast to replace Traditional Digital TV.&lt;ref&gt;[http://nsn.com/news-events/press-room/press-releases/nokia-networks-first-to-trial-lte-for-national-tv-broadcasting Nokia Networks first to trial LTE for national TV broadcasting]&lt;/ref&gt; This use case remains controversial as some study are doubting about the capability of LTE Broadcast to address this use case efficiently in its current version.&lt;ref&gt;[https://tech.ebu.ch/docs/techreports/tr027.pdf Delivery of Broadcast Content over LTE]&lt;/ref&gt;

Also in July 2014, [[BBC Research &amp; Development]] and EE demonstrated LTE Broadcast during the [[2014 Commonwealth Games|XX Commonwealth Games]] in [[Glasgow]], Scotland using equipment from Huawei and Qualcomm.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bbc.co.uk/rd/blog/2014-07-bbc-research-development-to-demonstrate-4g-broadcast-for-commonwealth-games BBC Research &amp; Development to Demonstrate 4G Broadcast for Commonwealth Games] by Andrew Murphy.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.techworld.com/news/networking/bbc-huawei-ee-unveil-4g-broadcasting-trial-at-commonwealth-games-3531478/ BBC, Huawei and EE unveil 4G broadcasting trial at Commonwealth Games] by Antony Savvas.&lt;/ref&gt;

In August 2014, Ericsson and Polkomtel successfully tested LTE Broadcast technology by streaming the opening game of the 2014 World Volleyball Championship to hundreds of guests at Warsaw’s National Stadium in Poland on August 30.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ericsson.com/news/1852728&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 2015, BBC Research &amp; Development and EE demonstrated LTE Broadcast during the [[FA Cup]] final in the [[U.K.]]
&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bbc.co.uk/rd/blog/2015-05-4g-broadcast-trial-wembley-2015-fa-cup-final 4G Broadcast technology trial at Wembley 2015 FA Cup Final] by Chris Nokes.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.digitaltveurope.net/375521/ee-and-bbc-trial-4g-broadcast-at-fa-cup-final/ EE and BBC trial 4G broadcast at FA Cup Final].&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 2015, Verizon demonstrated eMBMS by broadcasting [[INDYCAR]] races.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.strategyanalytics.com/strategy-analytics/blogs/components/rf-wireless/rf-and-wireless/2015/09/01/lte-broadcast-launches-in-the-us#.VwVminUrKAo&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 2015, Verizon commercially launched their [[Go90]] eMBMS service. Go90 offers both On-Demand and LiveTV, in both Unicast and Broadcast, and supports more than 10 different LTE Broadcast mobile devices.
&lt;ref&gt;https://www.usatoday.com/story/tech/2015/10/01/verizon-launches-go90-mobile-video-service/73138654/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[

In February 2016, [[Akamai Technologies|Akamai]] demonstrated with Expway, delivery of video streams across LTE networks with live on the fly switching from unicast to broadcast, at [[Mobile World Congress]] 2016.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.akamai.com/us/en/about/news/press/2016-press/akamai-showcases-mobile-innovation-at-mobile-world-congress-2016.jsp&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 2016, Verizon, [[Telstra]], KT and EE launched the LTE Broadcast Alliance.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.fiercewireless.com/tech/story/verizon-telstra-kt-and-ee-launch-lte-broadcast-alliance/2016-04-27|title=Verizon, Telstra, kt and EE launch LTE-Broadcast Alliance  {{!}} FierceWireless|last=Alleven|first=Monica|date=April 27, 2016|website=www.fiercewireless.com|language=en|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180828085736/https://www.fiercewireless.com/tech/verizon-telstra-kt-and-ee-launch-lte-broadcast-alliance|archive-date=August 28, 2018|dead-url=no|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite many technology trials and demonstrations, as of September 2018 there are no commercial deployments of 3G MBMS or 4G eMBMS anywhere in the world.

== Competing technologies ==
Main competing technologies of MBMS include [[DVB-H]]/[[DVB-T]], [[DVB-SH]], [[Digital Multimedia Broadcasting|DMB]], ESM-[[Digital Audio Broadcasting|DAB]], and [[MediaFLO]]. However, due to spectrum scarcity and the cost of building new broadcast infrastructure some of these technologies may not be viable. MediaFLO has been deployed commercially in the US by Verizon Wireless through their relationship with MediaFLO USA, Inc. (a subsidiary of Qualcomm) however the service was shut down in early 2011.&lt;ref&gt;[[MediaFLO]]&lt;/ref&gt; DMB and DVB-H trials have been ongoing for more than a year now, like those during the football 2006 championships in Germany.

Huawei's proprietary CMB is a precursor to the Multimedia Broadcast Multicast Service. It was specified in [[3GPP]] R6 and is using existing [[UMTS]] infrastructure. Huawei says that CMB is based on existing UMTS infrastructure and real time streaming application protocol.

The most significant competition is from services that stream individual video feeds to users over uni-cast data connections. While less efficient in certain situations, particularly the traditional case where everyone watches the same stream simultaneously, the user convenience of individual streaming has taken over the vast majority of the mobile media streaming market.

== Technical description ==
The MBMS feature is split into the MBMS Bearer Service and the MBMS User Service and has been defined to be offered over both [[UTRAN]] (i.e. [[WCDMA]], TD-CDMA and TD-SCDMA) and [[LTE (telecommunication)|LTE]] (where it is often referred to as eMBMS). The MBMS Bearer Service includes a Unicast and a Broadcast Mode. MBMS Operation On-Demand (MOOD) allows dynamic switching between Unicast and Broadcast over LTE, based on configured triggers. The MBMS Bearer Service uses IP multicast addresses for the IP flows. The advantage of the MBMS Bearer Service compared to unicast bearer services (interactive, streaming, etc.) is that the transmission resources in the [[Core network|core]] and [[Radio access network|radio]] networks are shared.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ericsson.com/res/thecompany/docs/publications/ericsson_review/2013/er-lte-broadcast.pdf Delivering content with LTE broadcast] By Thorsten Lohmar, Michael Slssingar, Vera Kenehan and Stif Puustinen, Ericsson Review, February 11, 2013&lt;/ref&gt; One MBMS packet flow is replicated by [[GGSN]], SGSN and RNCs. MBMS may use an advanced counting scheme to decide, whether or not zero, one or more dedicated (i.e. unicast) radio channels lead to a more efficient system usage than one common (i.e. broadcast) radio channel.

* UTRAN MBMS offers up to 256 kbit/s per MBMS Bearer Service and between 800 kbit/s and 1.7 Mbit/s per cell/band. The actual cell capacity depends on the [[User equipment|UE]] capabilities.
* GERAN MBMS offers between 32 kbit/s and 128 kbit/s. Up to 4 GSM timeslots may be used for one MBMS bearer in the downlink direction. The actual data rate per Traffic Slot depends on network dimensioning.

The MBMS User Service is basically the MBMS Service Layer and offers two different data Delivery Methods:

* The '''Streaming Delivery Method''' can be used for continuous transmissions like mobile television services. An application layer [[Forward error correction|FEC]] code may be used To increase the transmission reliability.
* The '''Download Delivery Method''' is intended for “download and play” services. A '''File Repair''' service may be offered to compensate for unreliable delivery.

MBMS has been standardized in various groups of [[3GPP]] (Third Generation Partnership Project), and the first phase standards are found in [[UMTS]] release 6. As Release 6 was functionally frozen by the 3rd quarter of 2004, practical network implementations may be expected by the end of 2007, and the first functional mobile terminals supporting MBMS are estimated to be available by also end of 2007.

eMBMS has been standardized in various groups of 3GPP as part of LTE release 9.  The [[LTE (telecommunication)|LTE]] version of MBMS, referred to as [[Multicast-broadcast single-frequency network]] (MBSFN), supports broadcast only services and is based on a Single Frequency Network (SFN) based [[OFDM]] waveform and so is functional similar to other broadcast solutions such as DVB-H, -SH and -NGH.

The '''Land Surface Model (LSM)''' is a unidimensional computational model developed by ''Gordon Bonan'' that describes ecological processes joined in many [[ecosystem model]]s, hydrological processes found in hydrological models and flow of surface common in surface models using atmospheric models.

In this way, the model examines interactions especially biogeophysics (sensible and latent heat, momentum, albedo, emission of long waves) and biogeochemistry (CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) of the land-atmosphere the effect of surface of the land in the climate and composition of the atmosphere.

This model has a simplified treatment of the surface flows that reproduce at the very least computational cost the essential characteristics of the important interactions of the land-atmosphere for climatic simulations.

As the types of surface vegetated for some species are several, have a standardization of types of covering being enclosed surfaces covered with water as lakes (amongst others); thus the model wheel for each point of independent form, with the same average of the atmospheric interactions. The model functions in a space grating that can vary of a point until global.

[[File:National Humanities Medal cropped.jpg|thumb|right|The obverse of the National Humanities Medal]]

The '''National Humanities Medal''' is an American award that annually recognizes several individuals, groups, or institutions for work that has "deepened the nation's understanding of the humanities, broadened our citizens' engagement with the humanities, or helped preserve and expand Americans' access to important resources in the humanities."&lt;ref name=awards&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.neh.gov/whoweare/awards.html |title=Awards and Honors |publisher=[[National Endowment for the Humanities]] |accessdate=January 23, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;!-- is it always, or always nowadays, or not always conferred ceremonially by the US President? --&gt;

The annual '''[[Charles Frankel]] Prize in the Humanities''' was established in 1988 and succeeded by the National Humanities Medal in 1997. The initial design for the National Humanities Medal was created by a 1995 Frankel Prize winner, [[David Macaulay]], and was used for all recipients through 2012.&lt;ref name=awards /&gt; During 2013, The National Endowment for the Humanities ran a public competition for a new medal design, judged by metalsmith [[Chunghi Choo]], coin engraver [[Don Everhart]] of the [[United States Mint|U.S. Mint]] and sculptor [[George Anthonisen]]. In June 2013, the agency announced that a design by Paul C. Balan of Illinois had been selected as the winner. The final medal will be unveiled in Washington D.C. in November 2013. The new design was used for the first time for the 2013 National Humanities Medals, which were presented in mid-2014.&lt;ref name=NewNHM2013&gt;{{cite web |title=Paul C.

Medals are conferred once annually, usually by the U.S. President, to as many as twelve living candidates and existing organizations nominated early in the calendar year. The President selects the winners in consultation with the [[National Endowment for the Humanities]].&lt;ref name=nominations&gt;{{cite  web |url=http://www.neh.gov/whoweare/medalsnominate.html |title=National Humanities Medals Nominations |publisher=National Endowment for the Humanities |accessdate=March 18, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From 1929&lt;ref&gt;Thomas Parke Hughes ''Networks of power: electrification in Western society, 1880-1930'' JHU Press, 1993 {{ISBN|0-8018-4614-5}} page 376&lt;/ref&gt; to the late 1960s, large [[alternating current]] power systems were modelled and studied on '''AC network analyzers''' (also called '''alternating current network calculators''' or '''AC calculating boards''')  or '''transient network analyzers'''. These special-purpose [[analog computer]]s were an outgrowth of the DC calculating boards used in the very earliest power system analysis. By the middle of the 1950s, fifty network analyzers were in operation.&lt;ref&gt;Charles Eames, Ray Eames ''A Computer Perspective: Background to the Computer Age'',Harvard University Press, 1990 0674156269, page 117&lt;/ref&gt; AC network analyzers were much used for [[Power flow study|power flow studies]], short circuit calculations, and system stability studies, but were ultimately replaced by numerical solutions running on digital computers. While the analyzers could provide real-time simulation of events, with no concerns about numeric stability of algorithms, the analyzers were costly, inflexible, and limited in the number of buses and lines that could be simulated.&lt;ref&gt;M.A. Laughton, D.F Warne (ed),''Electrical Engineer's Reference Book (16th Edition)'', Elsevier, 2003 {{ISBN|978-1-60119-452-7}} pages 368-369&lt;/ref&gt;  Eventually powerful digital computers replaced analog network analyzers for practical calculations, but analog physical models for studying electrical transients are still in use.

== Calculating methods ==
As AC power systems became larger at the start of the 20th century, with more interconnected devices, the problem of calculating the expected behavior of the systems became more difficult. Manual methods were only practical for systems of a few sources and nodes. The complexity of practical problems made manual calculation techniques too laborious or inaccurate to be useful. Many mechanical aids to calculation were developed to solve problems relating to network power systems.

DC calculating boards used resistors and DC sources to represent an AC network. A resistor was used to model the inductive reactance of a circuit, while the actual series resistance of the circuit was neglected. The principle disadvantage was the inability to model complex impedances. However, for short-circuit fault studies, the effect of the resistance component was usually small. DC boards served to produce results accurate to around 20% error, sufficient for some purposes.

Artificial lines were used to analyze transmission lines. These carefully constructed replicas of the distributed inductance, capacitance and resistance of a full-size line were used to investigate propagation of impulses in lines and to validate theoretical calculations of transmission line properties. An artificial line was made by winding layers of wire around a glass cylinder, with interleaved sheets of tin foil, to give the model proportionally the same distributed inductance and capacitance as the full-size line.  Later, lumped-element approximations of transmission lines were found to give adequate precision for many calculations.

Laboratory investigations of the stability of multiple-machine systems were constrained by the use of direct-operated indicating instruments (voltmeters, ammeters, and wattmeters). To ensure that the instruments negligibly loaded the model system, the machine power level used was substantial. Some workers in the 1920s used three-phase model generators rated up to 600 kVA and 2300 volts to represent a power system. General Electric developed model systems using generators rated at 3.75 kVA.&lt;ref&gt;H.P. Kuehni, R.G. Lorraine, ''A New A-C Network Analyzer'', ''Transactions AIEE'', February 1938 volume 57 page 67&lt;/ref&gt; It was difficult to keep multiple generators in synchronism, and the size and cost of the units was a constraint.  While transmission lines and loads could be accurately scaled down to laboratory representations, rotating machines could not be accurately miniaturized and keep the same dynamic characteristics as full-sized prototypes; the ratio of machine inertia to machine frictional loss did not scale.&lt;ref&gt;David A. Mindell, ''Between Human and Machine: Feedback, Control and Computing Before Cybernetics'', JHU Press, 2004 {{ISBN|0801880572}}
 pp.149-150&lt;/ref&gt;

==Scale model==
A network analyzer system was essentially a [[scale model]] of the electrical properties of a specific power system. Generators, transmission lines, and loads were represented by miniature electrical components with scale values in proportion to the modeled system.&lt;ref&gt;[[Edward Kimbark|Edward Wilson Kimbark]], ''Power System Stability'',Wiley-IEEE ,1948, {{ISBN|0-7803-1135-3}} page 64 and following&lt;/ref&gt; Model components were interconnected with flexible cords to represent the [[schematic|schematic diagram]] of the modeled system.

Instead of using miniature rotating machines, accurately calibrated phase-shifting transformers were built to simulate electrical machines.  These were all energized by the same source (at local power frequency or from a motor-generator set) and so inherently maintained synchronism. The phase angle and terminal voltage of each simulated generator could be set using rotary scales on each phase-shifting transformer unit. Using the [[per-unit system]] allowed values to be conveniently interpreted without additional calculation.

To reduce the size of the model components, the network analyzer often was energized at a higher frequency than the 50&amp;nbsp;Hz or 60&amp;nbsp;Hz [[utility frequency]]. The operating frequency was chosen to be high enough to allow high-quality inductors and capacitors to be made, and to be compatible with the available indicating instruments, but not so high that stray capacitance would affect results. Many systems used either 440&amp;nbsp;Hz, or 480&amp;nbsp;Hz, provided by a motor-generator set, to reduce size of model components. Some systems used 10&amp;nbsp;kHz, using capacitors and inductors similar to those used in radio electronics.

Model circuits were energized at relatively low voltages to allow for safe measurement with adequate precision. The model base quantities varied by manufacturer and date of design; as amplified indicating instruments became more common, lower base quantities were feasible.  Model voltages and currents started off around 200 volts and 0.5 amperes in the MIT analyzer, which still allowed directly driven (but especially sensitive) instruments to be used to measure model parameters. The later machines used as little as 50 volts and 50 mA, used with amplified indicating instruments. By use of the [[per-unit system]], model quantities could be readily transformed into the actual system quantities of voltage, current, power or impedance. A watt measured in the model might correspond to hundreds of kilowatts or megawatts in the modeled system. One hundred volts measured on the model might correspond to one per-unit, which could represent, say, 230,000 volts on a transmission line or 11,000 volts in a distribution system.  Typically, results accurate to around 2% of measurement could be obtained.&lt;ref&gt;Institution of Engineering and Technology , ''Power System Protection, Volumes 1-4'',  1995 {{ISBN|978-1-60119-889-1}} pages 216-220&lt;/ref&gt; Model components were single-phase devices, but using the [[symmetrical components]] method, unbalanced three-phase systems could be studied as well.

A complete network analyzer was a system that filled a large room; one model was described as four bays of equipment, spanning a U-shaped arrangement 26 feet (8 metres) across. Companies such as [[General Electric]] and [[Westinghouse Electric (1886)|Westinghouse]] could provide consulting services based on their analyzers; but some large electrical utilities operated their own analyzers. The use of network analyzers allowed quick solutions to difficult calculation problems, and allowed problems to be analyzed that would otherwise be uneconomic to compute using manual calculations. Although expensive to build and operate, network analyzers often repaid their costs in reduced calculation time and expedited project schedules.&lt;ref&gt;Aad Blok, Greg Downey (ed) ''Uncovering Labour in Information Revolutions, 1750-2000'', Cambridge University Press, 2003 {{ISBN|0521543533}}, pp. 76-80&lt;/ref&gt; For example, a stability study might indicate if a transmission line should have larger or differently spaced conductors to preserve stability margin during system faults; potentially saving many miles of cable and thousands of insulators.

Network analyzers did not directly simulate the dynamic effects of load application to machine dynamics (torque angle, and others).  Instead, the analyzer would be used to solve dynamic problems in a stepwise fashion, first calculating a load flow, then adjusting the phase angle of the machine in response to its power flow, and re-calculating the power flow.

In use, the system to be modelled would be represented as a [[One-line diagram|single line diagram]] and all the impedances of lines and machines would be scaled to model values on the analyzer. A plugging diagram would be prepared to show the interconnections to be made between the model elements. The circuit elements would be interconnected by patch cables. The model system would be energized, and measurements taken at the points of interest in the model; these could be scaled up to the values in the full-scale system.&lt;ref name=HarderGHN&gt;http://www.ieeeghn.org/wiki/images/e/ec/Chapter_6-Calculating_Power_(Edwin_L._Harder).pdf Calculating Power, retrieved 2013 Feb 26&lt;/ref&gt;

==The MIT network analyzer==
The network analyzer installed at [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]] (MIT) grew out of a 1924 thesis project by Hugh H. Spencer and [[Harold Locke Hazen]], investigating a power system modelling concept proposed by [[Vannevar Bush]]. Instead of miniature rotating machines, each generator was represented by a transformer with adjustable voltage and phase, all fed from a common source. This eliminated the poor accuracy of models with miniature machines.  The 1925 publication of this thesis attracted the attention at General Electric, where [[Robert Doherty (college president)|Robert Doherty]] was interested in modelling problems of system stability. He asked Hazen to verify that the model could accurately reproduce the behavior of machines during load changes.

Design and construction was carried out jointly by General Electric and MIT. When first demonstrated in June 1929, the system had eight phase-shifting transformers to represent synchronous machines. Other elements included 100 variable line resistors, 100 variable reactors, 32 fixed capacitors, and 40 adjustable load units. The analyzer was described in a 1930 paper by H.L Hazen, O.R. Schurig and M.F. Gardner. The base quantities for the analyzer were 200 volts, and 0.5 amperes. Sensitive portable thermocouple-type instruments were used for measurement.&lt;ref&gt;H.L Hazen, O.R. Schurig and M.F. Gardner. ''The M.I.T. Network Analyzer Design and Application to Power System Problems'', ''Transactions AIEEE'', July 1930 pp.1102-1113&lt;/ref&gt; The analyzer occupied four large panels, arranged in a U-shape, with tables in front of each section to hold measuring instruments. While primarily conceived as an educational tool, the analyzer saw considerable use by outside firms, who would pay to use the device.  [[American Gas and Electric Company]], the [[Tennessee Valley Authority]], and many other organizations studied problems on the MIT analyzer in its first decade of operation.  In 1940 the system was moved and expanded to handle more complex systems.

By 1953 the MIT analyzer was beginning to fall behind the state of the art.  Digital computers were first used on power system problems as early as "[[Whirlwind I|Whirlwind]]" in 1949. Unlike most of the forty other analyzers in service by that point, the MIT instrument was energized at 60&amp;nbsp;Hz, not 440 or 480&amp;nbsp;Hz, making its components large, and expansion to new types of problems difficult. Many utility customers had bought their own network analyzers. The MIT system was dismantled and sold to the [[Puerto Rico Electric Power Authority|Puerto Rico Water Resources Authority]] in 1954.&lt;ref&gt;Karl L. Wildes, Nilo A. Lindgren  ''A Century of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science at MIT, 1882-1982'' MIT Press 1985 {{ISBN|0262231190}}, pp. 100-104&lt;/ref&gt;

== Commercial manufacturers ==

By 1947, fourteen network analyzers had been built at a total cost of about two million US dollars. General Electric built two full-scale network analyzers for its own work and for services to its clients. Westinghouse built systems for their internal use and provided more than 20 analyzers to utility and university clients. After the Second World War analyzers were known to be in use in France, the UK, Australia, Japan, and the Soviet Union. Later models had improvements such as centralized control of switching, central measurement bays, and chart recorders to automatically provide permanent records of results.

General Electric's Model 307 was a miniaturized AC network analyzer with four generator units and a single electronically amplified metering unit. It was targeted at utility companies to solve problems too large for hand computation but not worth the expense of renting time on a full size analyzer.  Like the Iowa State College analyzer, it used a system frequency of 10&amp;nbsp;kHz instead of 60&amp;nbsp;Hz or 480&amp;nbsp;Hz, allowing much smaller radio-style capacitor and inductors to be used to model power system components. The 307 was cataloged from 1957 and had a list of about 20 utility, educational and government customers. In 1959 its list price was $8,590.&lt;ref&gt;http://ed-thelen.org/comp-hist/GE-Computer_Department_Data_Book_1960.pdf ''GE-Computer_Department_Data_Book_1960'', page 150-152, retrieved 2013 Feb 7&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1953, the [[Metropolitan Edison Company]] and a group of six other electrical companies purchased a new Westinghouse AC network analyzer for installation at the [[Franklin Institute]] in Philadelphia.  The system, described as the largest ever built,  cost $400,000.&lt;ref&gt;https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=2202&amp;dat=19530204&amp;id=RVMmAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=nf8FAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=830,3636416 Gettysburg Times ''7 firms will put analyzer in institute'', February 4, 1953&lt;/ref&gt;

In Japan, network analyzers were installed starting in 1951. The [[Yokogawa Electric]] company introduced a model energized at 3980&amp;nbsp;Hz starting in 1956.&lt;ref&gt;http://www2.iee.or.jp/ver2/honbu/14-magazine/log/2004/2004_08a_03.pdf Historical Trends and Interactive Relationship in Establishment of the

A "transient network analyzer" was an analog model of a transmission system especially adapted to study high-frequency transient surges (such as those due to lightning or switching), instead of AC power frequency currents. Similarly to an AC network analyzer, they represented apparatus and lines with scaled inductances and resistances. A synchronously driven switch repeatedly applied a transient impulse to the model system, and the response at any point could be observed on an [[oscilloscope]] or recorded on an oscillograph. Some transient analyzers are still in use for research and education, sometimes combined with digital [[protective relay]]s or recording instruments.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.cpri.in/about-us/departmentsunits/power-system-division-psd/transient-network-analyser.html
TNA at Central Power Research Institute, India retrieved 2013 Feb 26&lt;/ref&gt;

===Anacom===
The Westinghouse ''Anacom'' was an AC-energized electrical analog computer system used extensively for problems in mechanical design, structural elements, lubrication oil flow, and various transient problems including those due to lightning surges in electric power transmission systems. The excitation frequency of the computer could be varied. The Westinghouse Anacom constructed in 1948 was used up to the early 1990s for engineering calculations; its original cost was $500,000. The system was periodically updated and expanded; by the 1980s the Anacom could be run through many simulation cases unattended, under the control of a digital computer that automatically set up initial conditions and recorded the results. Westinghouse built a replica Anacom for [[Northwestern University]], sold an Anacom to [[ABB Group|ABB]], and twenty or thirty similar computers by other makers were used around the world.&lt;ref name=HarderGHN/&gt;

===Physics and chemistry===
Since the multiple elements of the AC network analyzer formed a powerful analog computer, occasionally problems in physics and chemistry were modeled (by such researchers as [[Gabriel Kron]] of [[General Electric]]), in the late 1940s prior to the ready availability of general-purpose digital computers.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.metaphorik.de/12/tympasdalouka.pdf retrieved 2008 Jan 26&lt;/ref&gt; Another application was water flow in water distribution systems. The forces and displacements of a mechanical system could be readily modelled with the voltages and currents of a network analyzer, which allowed easy adjustment of properties such as the stiffness of a spring by, for example, changing the value of a capacitor. &lt;ref name=JS13/&gt;

===Structures===
The [[David Taylor Model Basin]] operated an AC network analyzer from the late 1950s until the mid-1960s. The system was used on problems in ship design. An electrical analog of the structural properties of a proposed ship, shaft, or other structure could be built, and tested for its vibrational modes.  Unlike AC analyzers used for power systems work, the exciting frequency was made continuously variable so that mechanical resonance effects could be investigated.

==Decline and obsolescence==
Even during the Depression and the Second World War, many network analyzers were constructed because of their great value in solving calculations related to electric power transmission. By the mid 1950s, about thirty analyzers were available in the United States, representing an oversupply.  Institutions such as MIT could no longer justify operating analyzers as paying clients barely covered operating expenses. &lt;ref name=JS13&gt; James S. Small, ''The Analogue Alternative: The Electronic Analogue Computer in Britain and the USA, 1930-1975'', Routledge, 2013, {{ISBN|1134699026}}, pages 35-40&lt;/ref&gt;  

Once digital computers of adequate performance became available, the solution methods developed on analog network analyzers were migrated to the digital realm, where plugboards, switches and meter pointers were replaced with punch cards and printouts. The same general-purpose digital computer hardware that ran network studies could easily be dual-tasked with business functions such as payroll. Analog network analyzers faded from general use for load-flow and fault studies, although some persisted in transient studies for a while longer. Analog analyzers were dismantled and either sold off to other utilities, donated to engineering schools, or scrapped.

The fate of a few analyzers illustrates the trend. The analyzer purchased by [[American Electric Power]] was replaced by digital systems in 1961, and donated to [[Virginia Tech]]. The Westinghouse network analyzer purchased by the [[State Electricity Commission of Victoria]], Australia in 1950 was taken out of utility service in 1967 and donated to the Engineering department at [[Monash University]]; but by 1985, even instructional use of the analyzer was no longer practical and the system was finally dismantled.&lt;ref&gt;https://collections.museumvictoria.com.au/items/1763754 Photograph of part of a Westinghouse network analyzer, retrieved 2017 Aug 3&lt;/ref&gt;

One factor contributing to the obsolescence of analog models was the increasing complexity of interconnected power systems. Even a large analyzer could only represent a few machines, and perhaps a few score lines and busses. Digital computers routinely handled systems with thousands of busses and transmission lines.

[[File:Moonfromoakland04052006.jpg|thumb|The [[Moon]] is the most often viewed major object in the night sky, while sometimes visible during [[daytime]].]]
[[File:Flammarion.jpg|thumb|The [[Flammarion engraving]], Paris 1888]]

The term '''night sky''', usually associated with [[astronomy]] from [[Earth]], refers to the [[night]]time appearance of [[astronomical object|celestial objects]] like [[star]]s, [[planet]]s, and the [[Moon]], which are visible in a clear [[sky]] between [[sunset]] and [[sunrise]], when the [[Sun]] is below the [[horizon]].

Natural light sources in a night sky include [[moonlight]], [[starlight]], and [[airglow]], depending on location and timing. [[Aurora]]e light up the skies above the [[polar circle]]s. Occasionally, a large [[coronal mass ejection]] from the Sun or simply high levels of [[solar wind]] may extend the phenomenon toward the [[Equator]].&lt;ref name="Northern Lights"&gt;{{cite web |last1=Yukon |first1=Northwestel |title=Aurora Borealis Explained |url=http://www.northernlightscentre.ca/northernlights.html |publisher=Northern Lights Centre |accessdate=2015-02-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The night sky and studies of it have a historical place in both ancient and modern cultures. In the past, for instance, [[farmer]]s have used the status of the night sky as a [[calendar]] to determine when to [[agriculture|plant crops]]. Many cultures have drawn [[constellation]]s between [[star]]s in the sky, using them in association with [[legend]]s and [[mythology]] about their [[deity|deities]].

The [[history of astrology|anciently developed]] belief of [[astrology]] is generally based on the belief that relationships between heavenly bodies influence or convey information about events on Earth. The ''scientific'' study of celestial objects visible at night takes place in the science of [[observational astronomy]].



The visibility of celestial objects in the night sky is affected by [[light pollution]]. The presence of the Moon in the night sky has historically hindered astronomical observation by increasing the amount of [[sky brightness|ambient brightness]]. With the advent of artificial light sources, however, light pollution has been a growing problem for viewing the night sky. [[Optical filter]]s and modifications to light fixtures can help to alleviate this problem, but for optimal views, both professional and [[amateur astronomy|amateur astronomers]] seek locations far from [[urban area|urban]] [[skyglow]].

== Brightness ==
{{Main|Sky brightness}}

[[File:Starry Night at La Silla.jpg|thumb|The [[Milky Way]] is brighter in the Southern Hemisphere than in the North. (Photo taken at [[La Silla Observatory]])&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Starry Night at La Silla|url=http://www.eso.org/public/images/potw1333a/|accessdate=20 August 2013|newspaper=ESO Picture of the Week}}&lt;/ref&gt; ]]

The fact that the sky is not completely dark at night, even in the absence of moonlight and city lights, can be easily observed, since if the sky were absolutely dark, one would not be able to see the silhouette of an object against the sky.

The intensity of the sky varies greatly over the day and the primary cause differs as well. During daytime when the sun is above the horizon direct scattering of sunlight ([[Rayleigh scattering]]) is the overwhelmingly dominant source of light. In twilight, the period of time between sunset and sunrise, the situation is more complicated and a further differentiation is required. Twilight is divided in three segments according to how far the sun is below the horizon in segments of 6°.

After sunset the [[civil twilight]] sets in, and ends when the sun drops more than 6° below the horizon. This is followed by the [[nautical twilight]], when the sun reaches heights of -6° and -12°, after which comes the [[astronomical twilight]] defined as the period from -12° to -18°. When the sun drops more than 18° below the horizon the sky generally attains its minimum brightness.

Several sources can be identified as the source of the intrinsic brightness of the sky, namely [[airglow]],  indirect scattering of sunlight, scattering of starlight, and artificial [[light pollution]].

== Visual presentation ==
[[File:Паранальские ночи.jpg|thumb|[[Paranal Observatory]] nights.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Paranal Nights|url=http://www.eso.org/public/images/potw1401a/|accessdate=7 January 2014|newspaper=ESO Picture of the Week}}&lt;/ref&gt; The concept of [[noctcaelador]] tackles the aesthetic perception of the night sky.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url =https://www.questia.com/library/journal/1G1-175442997/academic-orientation-academic-achievement-and-noctcaelador| title =Academic Orientation, Academic Achievement, and Noctcaelador: Does Interest in Night-Sky Watching Correlate with Students' Approach to the Academic Environment?  |publisher =[[Questia]]| author=Kelly, William E.| author2=Daughtry, Don|accessdate =10 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]

Depending on local sky cloud cover, pollution, humidity, and light pollution levels, the stars visible to the unaided naked eye appear as hundreds, thousands or tens of thousands of white pinpoints of light in an otherwise near black sky together with some faint nebulae or clouds of light .&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.newton.dep.anl.gov/askasci/ast99/ast99238.htm |title=Number of Stars in the Sky |last1=Hawley |work=NEWTON Ask A Scientist |publisher=US Department of Energy |accessdate=October 23, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In ancient times the stars were often assumed to be equidistant on a dome above the earth because they are much too far away for [[stereopsis]] to offer any depth cues.  Visible stars range in color from blue (hot) to red (cold), but with such small points of faint light, most look white because they stimulate the [[rod cell]]s without triggering the [[cone cell]]s.  If it is particularly dark and a particularly faint celestial object is of interest, [[averted vision]] may be helpful.

The stars of the night sky cannot be counted unaided because they are so numerous and there is no way to track which have been counted and which have not.  Further complicating the count, fainter stars may appear and disappear depending on exactly where the observer is looking.  The result is an impression of an extraordinarily vast star field.

Because [[stargazing]] is best done from a dark place away from city lights, dark [[adaptation (eye)|adaptation]] is important to achieve and maintain.  It takes several minutes for eyes to adjust to the darkness necessary for seeing the most stars, and surroundings on the ground are hard to discern.  A red [[flashlight]] (torch) can be used to illuminate star charts, telescope parts, and the like without undoing the dark adaptation.  (See [[Purkinje effect]]).

=== Constellations ===
There are no markings on the night sky, though there exist many [[star chart|sky maps]] to aid stargazers in identifying [[constellation]]s and other celestial objects.  Constellations are prominent because their stars tend to be brighter than other nearby stars in the sky.  Different cultures have created different groupings of constellations based on differing interpretations of the more-or-less random patterns of dots in the sky.  Constellations were identified without regard to distance to each star, but instead as if they were all dots on a dome.

[[Orion (constellation)|Orion]] is among the most prominent and recognizable constellations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.astro.wisc.edu/~dolan/constellations/constellations/Orion.html |title=Orion |first=Chris |last=Dolan |accessdate=2007-10-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The [[Big Dipper]] (which has a wide variety of other names) is helpful for navigation in the northern hemisphere because it points to [[Polaris]], the north star.

The [[pole star]]s are special because they are approximately in line with the Earth's axis of rotation so they appear to stay in one place while the other stars rotate around them through the course of a night (or a year).

=== Planets ===
[[Planet]]s, named for the [[Greek language|Greek]] word for "wanderer," process through the star field a little each day, executing loops with time scales dependent on the length of the planet's year or orbital period around solar system.  Planets, to the naked eye, appear as points of light in the sky with variable brightness. Planets shine due to sunlight reflecting or scattering from the planets' surface or atmosphere. Thus the relative sun-planet-earth positions determine the planet's brightness. With a telescope or good binoculars, the planets appear as discs demonstrating finite size, and it is possible to observe orbiting moons which cast shadows onto the host planet's surface. [[Venus]] is the most prominent planet, often called the "morning star" or "evening star" because it is brighter than the stars and often the only "star" visible near sunrise or sunset, depending on its location in its orbit. [[Mercury (planet)|Mercury]], [[Mars]], [[Jupiter]] and [[Saturn]] are also visible to the naked eye.

=== The Moon ===
Earth's [[Moon]] is a grey disc in the sky with cratering visible to the naked eye.  It spans, depending on its exact location, 29-33 [[minute of arc|arcminutes]] - which is about the size of a thumbnail at arm's length, and is readily identified.  Over 28 days, the moon goes through a full cycle of [[lunar phase]]s.  People can generally identify phases within a few days by looking at the moon.  Unlike stars and most planets, the light reflected from the moon is bright enough to be seen during the day. (Venus can sometimes be seen even after sunrise.)

Some of the most spectacular moons come during the full moon phase near sunset or sunrise.  The moon on the horizon benefits from the [[moon illusion]] which makes it appear larger.  The light reflected from the moon traveling through the atmosphere also colors the moon orange and/or red.

=== Comets ===
[[Comet]]s come to the night sky only rarely.  Comets are illuminated by the sun, and their tails extend away from the sun.  A comet with visible tail is quite unusual - a [[great comet]] appears about once a decade.  They tend to be  visible only shortly before sunrise or after sunset because those are the times they are close enough to the sun to show a tail.

=== Clouds===
[[Cloud]]s obscure the view of other objects in the sky, though varying thicknesses of cloudcover have differing effects.  A very thin [[cirrus cloud]] in front of the moon might produce a rainbow-colored ring around the moon.  Stars and planets are too small or dim to take on this effect, and are instead only dimmed (often to the point of invisibility).  Thicker cloudcover obscures celestial objects entirely, making the sky black or reflecting city lights back down.  Clouds are often close enough to afford some depth perception, though they are hard to see without moonlight or light pollution.

=== Other objects ===
{{wide image|Deathvalleysky nps big.jpg|500px|The [[Milky Way]] can be seen as a very large streak or arc across the night sky if the [[visibility]] conditions are good enough. This [[panoramic]] photo was taken at [[Death Valley]].}}

[[File:Where Heaven and Earth Collide.jpg|thumb|The [[Milky Way]] contains billions of stars, arranged in two strikingly different structures: [[Milky Way#Halo|halo]] and [[Disc galaxy|disc]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Where Heaven and Earth Collide|url=http://www.eso.org/public/images/potw1635a/|website=www.eso.org|accessdate=29 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]

On clear dark nights in unpolluted areas, when the moon is thin or below the horizon, the [[Milky Way]], a band of what looks like white dust, can be seen.

The [[Magellanic Clouds]] of the southern sky are easily mistaken to be Earth-based clouds (hence the name) but are in fact collections of stars found outside the Milky Way known as [[Dwarf galaxy|dwarf galaxies]].

[[Zodiacal light]] is a glow that appears near the points where the sun rises and sets, and is caused by sunlight interacting with [[Interplanetary dust cloud|interplanetary dust]].

Shortly after sunset and before sunrise, artificial [[satellite]]s often look like stars—similar in brightness and size—but move relatively quickly. Those that fly in [[low Earth orbit]] cross the sky in a couple of minutes. Some satellites, including [[space debris]], appear to blink or have a periodic fluctuation in brightness because they are rotating. [[Satellite flare|Satellite flares]] can appear brighter than [[Venus]], with notable examples including the [[International Space Station]] (ISS) and [[Iridium satellite constellation|Iridium Satellites]].

[[Meteor]]s (commonly known as shooting stars) streak across the sky very infrequently. During a [[meteor shower]], they may average one a minute at irregular intervals, but otherwise their appearance is a random surprise. The occasional meteor will make a bright, fleeting streak across the sky, and they can be very bright in comparison to the night sky.

[[Aircraft]] are also visible at night, distinguishable at a distance from other objects because their lights blink.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4581">[[Image:Our Whole Lives.jpg|thumb|The Our Whole Lives logo.]]'''Our Whole Lives''', or '''OWL''', is a series of six comprehensive [[Sexual education|sexuality curricula]] for children, [[teenagers]], young adults and [[adults]] published by the [[Unitarian Universalist Association]] and the [[United Church of Christ]] [[Justice and Witness Ministries]].&lt;ref&gt;Unitarian Universalist Association Our Whole Lives pages (http://www.uua.org/re/owl). Retrieved on 2007 May 22.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;United Church of Christ Our Whole Lives pages (http://www.ucc.org/justice/sexuality_education/our-whole-lives.html). Retrieved on 2007 November 16.&lt;/ref&gt;  Publication was the result of seven years of collaborative effort by the two faiths to prepare material which addresses sexuality throughout the lifespan in [[age appropriate]] ways.

The Our Whole Lives program operates under the idea that well informed [[youth]] and young adults make better, healthier decisions about [[human sexuality|sexuality]] than those without complete information. OWL strives to be unbiased and teaches about [[heterosexual]], [[bisexual]], [[homosexual]], and [[transgender]] [[sexual health]]. In addition to information on sex, OWL is intended to help children, youth, and adults to be emotionally healthy and responsible in terms of their sexuality.

==Program structure==
There are four OWL curricula designed for the American school grades of K–1, 4–6, 7–9, 10–12, plus one for young adults (18- to 35-year-olds) and one for adults.

Each session of the Our Whole Lives curriculum can include the "Sexuality and Our Faith" companion, which comes in separate versions, one for the [[Unitarian Universalist Association|UUA]] and [[Canadian Unitarian Council|CUC]] communities and another one for the [[United Church of Christ|UCC]] community. Without "Sexuality and Our Faith," the programs have no religious material and are thus appropriate for use in schools and other non-religious institutions.

==Program values==
Our Whole Lives is built upon four core values:
# Self Worth
# Sexual Health
# Responsibility
# Justice and Inclusivity.

Participants are encouraged to use these values in decision-making concerning their own sexuality and relationships.  Throughout the program, participants are encouraged to explore and learn to articulate their own values.

==Program leaders==
Our Whole Lives classes are led by teams of facilitators recruited from within their congregations.  Before leading Our Whole Lives, facilitators must complete a training program led by certified trainers of trainers.  Training is intensive and focused on building the facilitation skills demanded by Our Whole Lives. In addition to exploring the core values and pedagogical theory underlying Our Whole Lives, trainings include opportunities to peer-facilitate a session, giving future leaders hands-on experience.  At the end of the training (which is approximately 20 hours of training over three days), facilitators must be certified by their trainers before leading Our Whole Lives in their congregations.  

Facilitators for Our Whole Lives work in teams of at least two – one male and one female – for each class.  The gender balance allows participants to feel comfortable raising concerns, questions and issues with their trainers.  For the middle school (grades 7-9) curriculum, some activities are done in gender segregated groups, otherwise all activities take place in mixed gender groups.  Leaders for Our Whole Lives are expected to model the program values - treating participants with respect and honoring their moral agency.

In Unitarian Universalist congregations the grades 7–9 OWL curriculum replaced the somewhat controversial [[About Your Sexuality]], which went out of print in the 1990s.

[[Artificial intelligence]] has close connections with [[philosophy]] because both share several concepts and these include intelligence, action, [[consciousness]], [[epistemology]], and even [[free will]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://jmc.stanford.edu/articles/aiphil2.html|title=The Philosophy of AI and the AI of Philosophy|last=McCarthy|first=John|website=jmc.stanford.edu|access-date=2018-09-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, the technology is concerned with the creation of artificial animals or artificial people (or, at least, artificial creatures) so the discipline is of considerable interest to philosophers.&lt;ref name=sep&gt;{{Citation|last=Bringsjord|first=Selmer|title=Artificial Intelligence|date=2018|url=https://plato.stanford.edu/archives/fall2018/entries/artificial-intelligence/|work=The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy|editor-last=Zalta|editor-first=Edward N.|edition=Fall 2018|publisher=Metaphysics Research Lab, Stanford University|access-date=2018-09-18|last2=Govindarajulu|first2=Naveen Sundar}}&lt;/ref&gt; These factors contributed to the emergence of the '''philosophy of artificial intelligence.''' Some scholars argue that the AI community's dismissal of philosophy is detrimental.

The philosophy of artificial intelligence attempts to answer such questions as follows:&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Russell|Norvig|2003|p=947}} define the philosophy of AI as consisting of the first two questions, and the additional question of the [[ethics of artificial intelligence]]. {{Harvnb|Fearn|2007|p=55}} writes "In the current literature, philosophy has two chief roles: to determine whether or not such machines would be conscious, and, second, to predict whether or not such machines are possible." The last question bears on the first two.&lt;/ref&gt;

* Can a machine act intelligently? Can it solve ''any'' problem that a person would solve by thinking?
* Are human intelligence and machine intelligence the same?  Is the [[human brain]] essentially a computer?
* Can a machine have a [[philosophy of mind|mind]], mental states, and [[consciousness]] in the same way that a human being can? Can it ''feel how things are''?
These three questions reflect the divergent interests of [[artificial intelligence|AI researchers]], [[Linguistics|linguists]], [[cognitive science|cognitive scientists]] and [[philosophy|philosopher]]s respectively. The scientific answers to these questions depend on the definition of "intelligence" and "consciousness" and exactly which "machines" are under discussion.

Important [[proposition]]s in the philosophy of AI include:

*[[Turing test|Turing's "polite convention"]]: ''If a machine behaves as intelligently as a human being, then it is as intelligent as a human being.''&lt;ref name=T&gt;This is a paraphrase of the essential point of the [[Turing test]]. {{Harvnb|Turing|1950}}, {{Harvnb|Haugeland|1985|pp=6–9}}, {{Harvnb|Crevier|1993|p=24}}, {{Harvnb|Russell|Norvig|2003|pp=2–3 and 948}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The [[Dartmouth Workshop#Planning the Summer Research Project: The Proposal |Dartmouth proposal]]: ''"Every aspect of learning or any other feature of intelligence can be so precisely described that a machine can be made to simulate it."''&lt;ref name=MMRS&gt;{{Harvnb|McCarthy|Minsky|Rochester|Shannon|1955}}. This assertion was printed in the program for the [[Dartmouth Conferences|Dartmouth Conference]] of 1956, widely considered the "birth of AI."also {{Harvnb|Crevier|1993|p=28}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Allen Newell|Newell]] and [[Herbert A. Simon|Simon]]'s [[physical symbol system]] hypothesis: ''"A physical symbol system has the necessary and sufficient means of general intelligent action."''&lt;ref name=NS&gt;{{Harvnb|Newell|Simon|1976}} and {{Harvnb|Russell|Norvig|2003|p=18}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[John Searle|Searle]]'s [[strong AI hypothesis]]: ''"The appropriately programmed computer with the right inputs and outputs would thereby have a mind in exactly the same sense human beings have minds."''&lt;ref name=SWAI&gt;This version is from {{Harvtxt|Searle|1999}}, and is also quoted in {{Harvnb|Dennett|1991|p=435}}. Searle's original formulation was "The appropriately programmed computer really is a mind, in the sense that computers given the right programs can be literally said to understand and have other cognitive states."  {{Harv|Searle|1980|p=1}}.  Strong AI is defined similarly by {{Harvtxt|Russell|Norvig|2003|p=947}}: "The assertion that machines could possibly act intelligently (or, perhaps better, act as if they were intelligent) is called the 'weak AI' hypothesis by philosophers, and the assertion that machines that do so are actually thinking (as opposed to simulating thinking) is called the 'strong AI' hypothesis."&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Thomas Hobbes|Hobbes]]' mechanism: ''"For 'reason' ... is nothing but 'reckoning,' that is adding and subtracting, of the consequences of general names agreed upon for the 'marking' and 'signifying' of our thoughts..."''&lt;ref name=H&gt;{{Harvnb|Hobbes|1651|loc=chpt. 5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Can a machine display general intelligence?==
Is it possible to create a machine that can solve ''all'' the problems humans solve using their intelligence? This question defines the scope of what machines will be able to do in the future and guides the direction of AI research. It only concerns the ''behavior'' of machines and ignores the issues of interest to [[psychology|psychologists]], cognitive scientists and [[philosophy|philosophers]]; to answer this question, it does not matter whether a machine is ''really'' thinking (as a person thinks) or is just ''acting like'' it is thinking.&lt;ref&gt;See {{Harvnb|Russell|Norvig|2003|p=3}}, where they make the distinction between ''acting'' rationally and ''being'' rational, and define AI as the study of the former.&lt;/ref&gt;

The basic position of most AI researchers is summed up in this statement, which appeared in the proposal for the [[Dartmouth workshop]] of 1956:
* ''Every aspect of learning or any other feature of intelligence can be so precisely described that a machine can be made to simulate it.''&lt;ref name=MMRS/&gt;
Arguments against the basic premise must show that building a working AI system is impossible, because there is some practical limit to the abilities of computers or that there is some special quality of the human mind that is necessary for thinking and yet cannot be duplicated by a machine (or by the methods of current AI research).  Arguments in favor of the basic premise must show that such a system is possible.

The first step to answering the question is to clearly define "intelligence".

===Intelligence===
[[File:Turing Test version 3.png|thumb|The "standard interpretation" of the Turing test.{{sfn|Saygin|2000}}]]

====Turing test====
{{Main|Turing test}}

[[Alan Turing]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Turing|1950}} and see {{Harvnb|Russell|Norvig|2003|p=948}}, where they call his paper "famous" and write "Turing examined a wide variety of possible objections to the possibility of intelligent machines, including virtually all of those that have been raised in the half century since his paper appeared."&lt;/ref&gt; reduced the problem of defining intelligence to a simple question about conversation. He suggests that: if a machine can answer ''any'' question put to it, using the same words that an ordinary person would, then we may call that machine intelligent. A modern version of his experimental design would use an online [[chat room]], where one of the participants is a real person and one of the participants is a computer program. The program passes the test if no one can tell which of the two participants is human.&lt;ref name=T/&gt; Turing notes that no one (except philosophers) ever asks the question "can people think?" He writes "instead of arguing continually over this point, it is usual to have a polite convention that everyone thinks".&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Turing|1950}} under "The Argument from Consciousness"&lt;/ref&gt; Turing's test extends this polite convention to machines:
* ''If a machine acts as intelligently as human being, then it is as intelligent as a human being.''
One criticism of the [[Turing test]] is that it is explicitly [[anthropomorphic]] {{Citation needed|date=April 2017}}. If our ultimate goal is to create machines that are ''more'' intelligent than people, why should we insist that our machines must closely ''resemble'' people?{{Cite quote|date=April 2017}} [[Stuart J. Russell|Russell]] and [[Peter Norvig|Norvig]] write that "aeronautical engineering texts do not define the goal of their field as 'making machines that fly so exactly like pigeons that they can fool other pigeons'".&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Russell|Norvig|2003|p=3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Intelligent agent definition====
[[File:IntelligentAgent-SimpleReflex.png|thumb|left|Simple reflex agent]]
Recent A.I. research defines intelligence in terms of [[intelligent agent]]s. An "agent" is something which perceives and acts in an environment. A "performance measure" defines what counts as success for the agent.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Russell|Norvig|2003|pp=4–5, 32, 35, 36 and 56}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
* ''If an agent acts so as to maximize the expected value of a performance measure based on past experience and knowledge then it is intelligent.''&lt;ref&gt;Russell and Norvig would prefer the word "[[rational agent|rational]]" to "intelligent".&lt;/ref&gt;
Definitions like this one try to capture the essence of intelligence. They have the advantage that, unlike the Turing test, they do not also test for human traits that we {{Who|date=April 2017}} may not want to consider intelligent, like the ability to be insulted or the temptation to lie {{Dubious|date=April 2017}}. They have the disadvantage that they fail to make the commonsense{{Definition|date=April 2017}} differentiation between "things that think" and "things that do not". By this definition, even a thermostat has a rudimentary intelligence.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Russell|Norvig|2003|pp=48–52}} consider a thermostat a simple form of [[intelligent agent]], known as a [[Intelligent agent#Classes of intelligent agents|reflex agent]]. For an in-depth treatment of the role of the thermostat in philosophy see {{harvtxt|Chalmers|1996|pp=293–301}} "4. Is Experience Ubiquitous?" subsections ''What is it like to be a thermostat?'', ''Whither panpsychism?'', and ''Constraining the double-aspect principle''.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Arguments that a machine can display general intelligence===

====The brain can be simulated====
{{Main|Artificial brain}}

[[File:MRI.ogg|thumbtime=2|thumb|240px|An [[MRI]] scan of a normal adult human brain]]
[[Hubert Dreyfus]] describes this argument as claiming that "if the nervous system obeys the laws of physics and chemistry, which we have every reason to suppose it does, then .... we ... ought to be able to reproduce the behavior of the nervous system with some physical device".&lt;ref name="Dreyfus 1972 p=106"&gt;{{Harvnb|Dreyfus|1972|p=106}}&lt;/ref&gt; This argument, first introduced as early as 1943&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Pitts|McCullough|1943}}&lt;/ref&gt; and vividly described by [[Hans Moravec]] in 1988,&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Moravec|1988}}&lt;/ref&gt; is now associated with futurist [[Ray Kurzweil]], who estimates that computer power will be sufficient for a complete brain simulation by the year 2029.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Kurzweil|2005|p=262}}. Also see {{Harvnb|Russell|Norvig|p=957}} and {{Harvnb|Crevier|1993|pp=271 and 279}}. The most extreme form of this argument (the brain replacement scenario) was put forward by [[Clark Glymour]] in the mid-1970s and was touched on by [[Zenon Pylyshyn]] and John Searle in 1980&lt;/ref&gt; A non-real-time simulation of a thalamocortical model that has the size of the human brain (10&lt;sup&gt;11&lt;/sup&gt; neurons) was performed in 2005&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Eugene Izhikevich |url=http://vesicle.nsi.edu/users/izhikevich/human_brain_simulation/Blue_Brain.htm |title=Eugene M. Izhikevich, Large-Scale Simulation of the Human Brain |publisher=Vesicle.nsi.edu |date=2005-10-27 |accessdate=2010-07-29 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090501041325/http://vesicle.nsi.edu/users/izhikevich/human_brain_simulation/Blue_Brain.htm |archivedate=2009-05-01 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and it took 50 days to simulate 1 second of brain dynamics on a cluster of 27 processors.

Few{{Quantify|date=April 2017}} disagree that a brain simulation is possible in theory,{{Citation needed|date=April 2017}}{{According to whom|date=April 2017}} even critics of AI such as Hubert Dreyfus and John Searle.&lt;ref&gt;Hubert Dreyfus writes: "In general, by accepting the fundamental assumptions that the nervous system is part of the physical world and that all physical processes can be described in a mathematical formalism which can, in turn, be manipulated by a digital computer, one can arrive at the strong claim that the behavior which results from human 'information processing,' whether directly formalizable or not, can always be indirectly reproduced on a digital machine." {{Harv|Dreyfus|1972|pp=194–5}}. [[John Searle]] writes: "Could a man made machine think? Assuming it possible produce artificially a machine with a nervous system, ... the answer to the question seems to be obviously, yes ... Could a digital computer think? If by 'digital computer' you mean anything at all that has a level of description where it can be correctly described as the instantiation of a computer program, then again the answer is, of course, yes, since we are the instantiations of any number of computer programs, and we can think." {{Harv|Searle|1980|p=11}}&lt;/ref&gt;
However, Searle points out that, in principle, ''anything'' can be simulated by a computer; thus, bringing the definition to its breaking point leads to the conclusion that any process at all can technically be considered "computation". "What we wanted to know is what distinguishes the mind from thermostats and livers," he writes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Searle|1980|p=7}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, merely mimicking the functioning of a brain would in itself be an admission of ignorance regarding intelligence and the nature of the mind {{Citation needed|date=April 2017}}.
&lt;!--ARENT THERE SOME MORE DIRECT REFUTATIONS OF KURZWEIL?? --&gt;

====Human thinking is symbol processing====
{{Main|Physical symbol system}}

In 1963, [[Allen Newell]] and [[Herbert A. Simon]] proposed that "symbol manipulation" was the essence of both human and machine intelligence. They wrote: 
* ''A physical symbol system has the necessary and sufficient means of general intelligent action.''&lt;ref name=NS/&gt;
This claim is very strong: it implies both that human thinking is a kind of symbol manipulation (because a symbol system is ''necessary'' for intelligence) and that machines can be intelligent (because a symbol system is ''sufficient'' for intelligence).&lt;ref&gt;Searle writes "I like the straight forwardness of the claim." {{Harvnb|Searle|1980|p=4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another version of this position was described by philosopher Hubert Dreyfus, who called it "the psychological assumption":
* ''The mind can be viewed as a device operating on bits of information according to formal rules.''&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Dreyfus|1979|p=156}}&lt;/ref&gt;
A distinction is usually made {{By whom|date=April 2017}} between the kind of high level symbols that directly correspond with objects in the world, such as &lt;nowiki&gt;&lt;dog&gt;&lt;/nowiki&gt; and &lt;nowiki&gt;&lt;tail&gt;&lt;/nowiki&gt; and the more complex "symbols" that are present in a machine like a [[neural network]]. Early research into AI, called "good old fashioned artificial intelligence" ([[GOFAI]]) by [[John Haugeland]], focused on these kind&lt;!--change to "kinds" or "types"?--&gt; of high level symbols.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Haugeland|1985|p=5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Arguments against symbol processing====
These arguments show that human thinking does not consist (solely) of high level symbol manipulation. They do ''not'' show that artificial intelligence is impossible, only that more than symbol processing is required.

=====Gödelian anti-mechanist arguments=====
{{Main article|Mechanism (philosophy)#G.C3.B6delian arguments|l1=Mechanism (philosophy): Gödelian arguments}}
In 1931, [[Kurt Gödel]] proved with an [[incompleteness theorem]] that it is always possible to construct a "Gödel [[statement (logic)|statement]]" that a given consistent [[formal system]] of logic (such as a high-level symbol manipulation program) could not prove. Despite being a true statement, the constructed Gödel statement is unprovable in the given system. (The truth of the constructed Gödel statement is contingent on the consistency of the given system; applying the same process to a subtly inconsistent system will appear to succeed, but will actually yield a false "Gödel statement" instead.){{Citation needed|date=April 2017}} More speculatively, Gödel conjectured that the human mind can correctly eventually determine the truth or falsity of any well-grounded mathematical statement (including any possible Gödel statement), and that therefore the human mind's power is not reducible to a ''[[Mechanism (philosophy)|mechanism]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[[Kurt Gödel|Gödel, Kurt]], 1951, ''Some basic theorems on the foundations of mathematics and their implications'' in  [[Solomon Feferman]], ed., 1995. ''Collected works / Kurt Gödel, Vol. III''. Oxford University Press: 304-23. - In this lecture, Gödel uses the incompleteness theorem to arrive at the following disjunction: (a) the human mind is not a consistent finite machine, or (b) there exist [[Diophantine equations]] for which it cannot decide whether solutions exist. Gödel finds (b) implausible, and thus seems to have believed the human mind was not equivalent to a finite machine, i.e., its power exceeded that of any finite machine. He recognized that this was only a conjecture, since one could never disprove (b). Yet he considered the disjunctive conclusion to be a "certain fact".&lt;/ref&gt; Philosopher [[John Lucas (philosopher)|John Lucas]] (since 1961) and [[Roger Penrose]] (since 1989) have championed this philosophical anti-mechanist argument.&lt;ref name=L&gt;{{Harvnb|Lucas|1961}}, {{Harvnb|Russell|Norvig|2003|pp=949–950}}, {{Harvnb|Hofstadter|1979|pp=471–473,476–477}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gödelian anti-mechanist arguments tend to rely on the innocuous-seeming claim that a system of human mathematicians (or some idealization of human mathematicians) is both consistent (completely free of error) and believes fully in its own consistency (and can make all logical inferences that follow from its own consistency, including belief in its Gödel statement) {{Citation needed|date=April 2017}}. This is provably impossible for a Turing machine {{Clarify|date=April 2017}} (and, by an informal extension, any known type of mechanical computer) to do; therefore, the Gödelian concludes that human reasoning is too powerful to be captured in a machine {{Dubious|date=April 2017}}.

However, the modern consensus in the scientific and mathematical community is that actual human reasoning is inconsistent; that any consistent "idealized version" ''H'' of human reasoning would logically be forced to adopt a healthy but counter-intuitive open-minded skepticism about the consistency of ''H'' (otherwise ''H'' is provably inconsistent); and that Gödel's theorems do not lead to any valid argument that humans have mathematical reasoning capabilities beyond what a machine could ever duplicate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author1=[[Graham Oppy]]|title=Gödel's Incompleteness Theorems|url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/goedel-incompleteness/#GdeArgAgaMec|website=[[Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy]]|accessdate=27 April 2016|date=20 January 2015|quote=These Gödelian anti-mechanist arguments are, however, problematic, and there is wide consensus that they fail.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=[[Stuart J. Russell]]|author2=[[Peter Norvig]]|title=[[Artificial Intelligence: A Modern Approach]]|date=2010|publisher=[[Prentice Hall]]|location=Upper Saddle River, NJ|isbn=0-13-604259-7|edition=3rd|chapter=26.1.2: Philosophical Foundations/Weak AI: Can Machines Act Intelligently?/The mathematical objection|quote=...even if we grant that computers have limitations on what they can prove, there is no evidence that humans are immune from those limitations.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Mark Colyvan. An introduction to the philosophy of mathematics. [[Cambridge University Press]], 2012. From 2.2.2, 'Philosophical significance of Gödel's incompleteness results': "The accepted wisdom (with which I concur) is that the Lucas-Penrose arguments fail."&lt;/ref&gt; This consensus that Gödelian anti-mechanist arguments are doomed to failure is laid out strongly in ''[[Artificial Intelligence (journal)|Artificial Intelligence]]'': "''any'' attempt to utilize (Gödel's incompleteness results) to attack the [[computationalism|computationalist]] thesis is bound to be illegitimate, since these results are quite consistent with the computationalist thesis."&lt;ref name=laforte&gt;LaForte, G., Hayes, P. J., Ford, K. M. 1998. Why Gödel's theorem cannot refute computationalism. [[Artificial Intelligence (journal)|Artificial Intelligence]], 104:265-286, 1998.&lt;/ref&gt;

More pragmatically, Russell and Norvig note that Gödel's argument only applies to what can theoretically be proved, given an infinite amount of memory and time. In practice, real machines (including humans) have finite resources and will have difficulty proving many theorems. It is not necessary to prove everything in order to be intelligent {{Definition|date=April 2017}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Russell|Norvig|2003|p=950}}  They point out that real machines with finite memory can be modeled using [[propositional logic]], which is formally [[Decidability (logic)|decidable]], and Gödel's argument does not apply to them at all.&lt;/ref&gt;

Less formally, [[Douglas Hofstadter]], in his [[Pulitzer prize]] winning book ''[[Gödel, Escher, Bach: An Eternal Golden Braid]],'' states that these "Gödel-statements" always refer to the system itself, drawing an analogy to the way the [[Epimenides paradox]] uses statements that refer to themselves, such as "this statement is false" or "I am lying".&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Hofstadter|1979}}&lt;/ref&gt; But, of course, the [[Epimenides paradox]] applies to anything that makes statements, whether they are machines ''or'' humans, even Lucas himself. Consider:
* ''Lucas can't assert the truth of this statement.''&lt;ref&gt;According to {{Harvnb|Hofstadter|1979|pp=476–477}}, this statement was first proposed by [[C. H. Whiteley]]&lt;/ref&gt;
This statement is true but cannot be asserted by Lucas. This shows that Lucas himself is subject to the same limits that he describes for machines, as are all people, and so [[John Lucas (philosopher)|Lucas]]'s argument is pointless.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Hofstadter|1979|pp=476–477}}, {{Harvnb|Russell|Norvig|2003|p=950}}, {{Harvnb|Turing|1950}} under "The Argument from Mathematics" where he writes "although it is established that there are limitations to the powers of any particular machine, it has only been stated, without sort of proof, that no such limitations apply to the human intellect."&lt;/ref&gt;

After concluding that human reasoning is non-computable, Penrose went on to controversially speculate that some kind of hypothetical non-computable processes involving the collapse of [[quantum mechanical]] states give humans a special advantage over existing computers. Existing quantum computers are only capable of reducing the complexity of Turing computable tasks and are still restricted to tasks within the scope of Turing machines. {{Citation needed|date=April 2017}} {{Clarify|date=April 2017}}. By Penrose and Lucas's arguments, existing quantum computers are not sufficient {{Citation needed|date=April 2017}}{{Clarify|date=April 2017}}{{Why|date=April 2017}}, so Penrose seeks for some other process involving new physics, for instance quantum gravity which might manifest new physics at the scale of the [[Planck mass]] via spontaneous quantum collapse of the wave function. These states, he suggested, occur both within neurons and also spanning more than one neuron.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Penrose|1989}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, other scientists point out that there is no plausible organic mechanism in the brain for harnessing any sort of quantum computation, and furthermore that the timescale of quantum decoherence seems too fast to influence neuron firing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Litt|first1=Abninder|last2=Eliasmith|first2=Chris|last3=Kroon|first3=Frederick W.|last4=Weinstein|first4=Steven|last5=Thagard|first5=Paul|title=Is the Brain a Quantum Computer?|journal=Cognitive Science|date=6 May 2006|volume=30|issue=3|pages=593–603|doi=10.1207/s15516709cog0000_59}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=====Dreyfus: the primacy of implicit skills=====
{{Main|Dreyfus' critique of artificial intelligence}}

Hubert Dreyfus [[argued that human intelligence|Hubert Dreyfus's views on artificial intelligence]] and expertise depended primarily on implicit skill  rather than explicit symbolic manipulation, and argued that these skills would never be captured in formal rules.&lt;ref name=D&gt;{{Harvnb|Dreyfus|1972}}, {{Harvnb|Dreyfus|1979}}, {{Harvnb|Dreyfus|Dreyfus|1986}}. See also {{Harvnb|Russell|Norvig|2003|pp=950–952}}, {{Harvnb|Crevier|1993|120-132}} and {{Harvnb|Hearn|2007|pp=50–51}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Hubert Dreyfus|Dreyfus]]'s argument had been anticipated by Turing in his 1950 paper [[Computing machinery and intelligence]], where he had classified this as the "argument from the informality of behavior."&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Russell|Norvig|2003|pp=950–51}}&lt;/ref&gt; Turing argued in response that, just because we do not know the rules that govern a complex behavior, this does not mean that no such rules exist. He wrote: "we cannot so easily convince ourselves of the absence of complete laws of behaviour ... The only way we know of for finding such laws is scientific observation, and we certainly know of no circumstances under which we could say, 'We have searched enough. There are no such laws.'"&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Turing|1950}} under "(8) The Argument from the Informality of Behavior"&lt;/ref&gt;

Russell and [[Peter Norvig|Norvig]] point out that, in the years since Dreyfus published his critique, progress has been made towards discovering the "rules" that govern unconscious reasoning.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Russell|Norvig|2003|p=52}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[situated]] movement in [[robotics]] research attempts to capture our unconscious skills at perception and attention.&lt;ref&gt;See {{Harvnb|Brooks|1990}} and {{Harvnb|Moravec|1988}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Computational intelligence]] paradigms, such as [[neural net]]s, [[evolutionary algorithm]]s and so on are mostly directed at simulated unconscious reasoning and learning. [[Artificial intelligence#Statistical|Statistical approaches to AI]] can make predictions which approach the accuracy of human intuitive guesses. Research into [[commonsense knowledge]] has focused on reproducing the "background" or context of knowledge. In fact, AI research in general has moved away from high level symbol manipulation or "[[GOFAI]]", towards new models that are intended to capture more of our ''unconscious'' reasoning {{According to whom|date=April 2017}}. Historian and AI researcher [[Daniel Crevier]] wrote that "time has proven the accuracy and perceptiveness of some of Dreyfus's comments. Had he formulated them less aggressively, constructive actions they suggested might have been taken much earlier."&lt;ref name="Crevier 1993 p=125"&gt;{{Harvnb|Crevier|1993|p=125}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This is a philosophical question, related to the [[problem of other minds]] and the [[hard problem of consciousness]]. The question revolves around a position defined by [[John Searle]] as "strong AI":
* ''A physical symbol system can have a mind and mental states.''&lt;ref name=SWAI/&gt;
Searle distinguished this position from what he called "weak AI":
* ''A physical symbol system can act intelligently.''&lt;ref name=SWAI/&gt;
Searle introduced the terms to isolate strong AI from weak AI so he could focus on what he thought was the more interesting and debatable issue. He argued that ''even if we assume'' that we had a computer program that acted exactly like a human mind, there would still be a difficult philosophical question that needed to be answered.&lt;ref name=SWAI/&gt;

Neither of Searle's two positions are of great concern to AI research, since they do not directly answer the question "can a machine display general intelligence?" (unless it can also be shown that consciousness is ''necessary'' for intelligence). Turing wrote "I do not wish to give the impression that I think there is no mystery about consciousness… [b]ut I do not think these mysteries necessarily need to be solved before we can answer the question [of whether machines can think]."&lt;ref name=T4&gt;{{Harvnb|Turing|1950}} under "(4) The Argument from Consciousness". See also {{Harvnb|Russell|Norvig|pp=952–3}}, where they identify Searle's argument with Turing's "Argument from Consciousness."&lt;/ref&gt; [[Stuart J. Russell|Russell]] and Norvig agree: "Most AI researchers take the weak AI hypothesis for granted, and don't care about the strong AI hypothesis."&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Russell|Norvig|2003|p=947}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are a few researchers who believe that consciousness is an essential element in intelligence, such as [[Igor Aleksander]], [[Stan Franklin]], [[Ron Sun]], and [[Artificial consciousness#Haikonen's cognitive architecture|Pentti Haikonen]], although their definition of "consciousness" strays very close to "intelligence." (See [[artificial consciousness]].)

Before we can answer this question, we must be clear what we mean by "minds", "mental states" and "consciousness".

===Consciousness, minds, mental states, meaning===

The words "[[mind]]" and "[[consciousness]]" are used by different communities in different ways. Some [[new age]] thinkers, for example, use the word "consciousness" to describe something similar to [[Bergson]]'s "[[élan vital]]": an invisible, energetic fluid that permeates life and especially the mind. [[Science fiction]] writers use the word to describe some [[essentialism|essential]] property that makes us human: a machine or alien that is "conscious" will be presented as a fully human character, with intelligence, desires, will, insight, pride and so on. (Science fiction writers also use the words "sentience", "sapience," "self-awareness" or "ghost" - as in the ''[[Ghost in the Shell]]'' manga and anime series - to describe this essential human property). For others {{Who|date=April 2017}}, the words "mind" or "consciousness" are used as a kind of secular synonym for the [[soul]].

For [[philosophy|philosophers]], [[neuroscience|neuroscientists]] and [[cognitive science|cognitive scientists]], the words are used in a way that is both more precise and more mundane: they refer to the familiar, everyday experience of having a "thought in your head", like a perception, a dream, an intention or a plan, and to the way we ''know'' something, or ''mean'' something or ''understand'' something {{Citation needed|date=April 2017}}. "It's not hard to give a commonsense definition of consciousness" observes philosopher John Searle.&lt;ref&gt;"[P]eople always tell me it was very hard to define consciousness, but I think if you're just looking for the kind of commonsense definition that you get at the beginning of the investigation, and not at the hard nosed scientific definition that comes at the end, it's not hard to give commonsense definition of consciousness." [http://www.abc.net.au/rn/philosopherszone/stories/2006/1639491.htm The Philosopher's Zone: The question of consciousness]. Also see {{Harvnb|Dennett|1991}}&lt;/ref&gt; What is mysterious and fascinating is not so much ''what'' it is but ''how'' it is: how does a lump of fatty tissue and electricity give rise to this (familiar) experience of perceiving, meaning or thinking?

[[Philosopher]]s call this the [[hard problem of consciousness]]. It is the latest version of a classic problem in the [[philosophy of mind]] called the "[[mind-body problem]]."&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Blackmore|2005|p=2}}&lt;/ref&gt; A related problem is the problem of ''meaning'' or ''understanding'' (which philosophers call "[[intentionality]]"): what is the connection between our ''thoughts'' and ''what we are thinking about'' (i.e. objects and situations out in the world)? A third issue is the problem of ''experience'' (or "[[Phenomenology (philosophy)|phenomenology]]"): If two people see the same thing, do they have the same experience? Or are there things "inside their head" (called "[[qualia]]") that can be different from person to person?&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Russell|Norvig|2003|pp=954–956}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Neurobiologist]]s believe all these problems will be solved as we begin to identify the [[neural correlates of consciousness]]: the actual relationship between the machinery in our heads and its collective properties; such as the mind, experience and understanding. Some of the harshest critics of [[artificial intelligence]] agree that the brain is just a machine, and that consciousness and intelligence are the result of physical processes in the brain.&lt;ref&gt;For example, John Searle writes: "Can a machine think? The answer is, obvious, yes. We are precisely such machines." {{Harv|Searle|1980|p=11}}&lt;/ref&gt; The difficult philosophical question is this: can a computer program, running on a digital machine that shuffles the binary digits of zero and one, duplicate the ability of the [[neural correlates of consciousness|neurons]] to create minds, with mental states (like understanding or perceiving), and ultimately, the experience of [[consciousness]]?

===Arguments that a computer cannot have a mind and mental states===

====Searle's Chinese room====
{{Main|Chinese room}}
[[John Searle]] asks us to consider a [[thought experiment]]: suppose we have written a computer program that passes the Turing test and demonstrates "general intelligent action." Suppose, specifically that the program can converse in fluent Chinese. Write the program on 3x5 cards and give them to an ordinary person who does not speak Chinese. Lock the person into a room and have him follow the instructions on the cards. He will copy out Chinese characters and pass them in and out of the room through a slot. From the outside, it will appear that the Chinese room contains a fully intelligent person who speaks Chinese. The question is this: is there anyone (or anything) in the room that understands Chinese? That is, is there anything that has the mental state of [[understanding]], or which has [[consciousness|conscious]] [[awareness]] of what is being discussed in Chinese? The man is clearly not aware. The room cannot be aware. The ''cards'' certainly aren't aware. Searle concludes that the [[Chinese room]], or ''any'' other physical symbol system, cannot have a mind.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Searle|1980}}. See also {{Harvnb|Cole|2004}}, {{Harvnb|Russell|Norvig|2003|pp=958–960}}, {{Harvnb|Crevier|1993|pp=269–272}} and {{Harvnb|Hearn|2007|pp=43–50}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Searle goes on to argue that actual mental states and [[consciousness]] require (yet to be described) "actual physical-chemical properties of actual human brains."&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Searle|1980|p=13}}&lt;/ref&gt; He argues there are special "causal properties" of [[brain]]s and [[neuron]]s that gives rise to [[mind]]s: in his words "brains cause minds."&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Searle|1984}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Related arguments: Leibniz' mill, Davis's telephone exchange, Block's Chinese nation and Blockhead====

[[Gottfried Leibniz]] made essentially the same argument as Searle in 1714, using the thought experiment of expanding the brain until it was the size of a [[mill (factory)|mill]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Cole|2004|loc=2.1}}, {{Harvnb|Leibniz|1714|loc=17}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1974, [[Lawrence Davis]] imagined duplicating the brain using telephone lines and offices staffed by people, and in 1978 [[Ned Block]] envisioned the entire population of China involved in such a brain simulation. This thought experiment is called "the Chinese Nation" or "the Chinese Gym".&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Cole|2004|loc=2.3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ned Block also proposed his [[Blockhead argument]], which is a version of the [[Chinese room]] in which the program has been [[code refactoring|re-factored]] into a simple set of rules of the form "see this, do that", removing all mystery from the program.

==== Responses to the Chinese room ====

Responses to the Chinese room emphasize several different points. 
* '''The systems reply''' and the '''virtual mind reply''':&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Searle|1980}} under "1. The Systems Reply (Berkeley)", {{Harvnb|Crevier|1993|p=269}}, {{Harvnb|Russell|Norvig|2003|p=959}}, {{Harvnb|Cole|2004|loc=4.1}}. Among those who hold to the "system" position (according to Cole) are Ned Block, [[Jack Copeland]], [[Daniel Dennett]], [[Jerry Fodor]], [[John Haugeland]], [[Ray Kurzweil]] and [[Georges Rey]]. Those who have defended the "virtual mind" reply include [[Marvin Minsky]], [[Alan Perlis]], [[David Chalmers]], Ned Block and J. Cole (again, according to {{Harvnb|Cole|2004}})&lt;/ref&gt; This reply argues that ''the system'', including the man, the program, the room, and the cards, is what understands Chinese. Searle claims that the man in the room is the only thing which could possibly "have a mind" or "understand", but others disagree, arguing that it is possible for there to be ''two'' minds in the same physical place, similar to the way a computer can simultaneously "be" two machines at once: one physical (like a [[Macintosh]]) and one "[[virtual machine|virtual]]" (like a [[word processor]]).
*'''Speed, power and complexity replies''':&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Cole|2004|loc=4.2}} ascribes this position to [[Ned Block]], Daniel Dennett, [[Tim Maudlin]], [[David Chalmers]], [[Steven Pinker]], [[Patricia Churchland]] and others.&lt;/ref&gt; Several critics point out that the man in the room would probably take millions of years to respond to a simple question, and would require "filing cabinets" of astronomical proportions. This brings the clarity of Searle's intuition into doubt.
*'''Robot reply''':&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Searle|1980}} under "2. The Robot Reply (Yale)". {{Harvnb|Cole|2004|loc=4.3}} ascribes this position to [[Margaret Boden]], [[Tim Crane]], Daniel Dennett, Jerry Fodor, [[Stevan Harnad]], Hans Moravec and [[Georges Rey]]&lt;/ref&gt; To truly understand, some believe the Chinese Room needs eyes and hands. Hans Moravec writes: 'If we could graft a robot to a reasoning program, we wouldn't need a person to provide the meaning anymore: it would come from the physical world."&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in {{Harvnb|Crevier|1993|p=272}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''Brain simulator reply''':&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Searle|1980}} under "3. The Brain Simulator Reply (Berkeley and M.I.T.)" {{Harvnb|Cole|2004}} ascribes this position to [[Paul Churchland|Paul]] and [[Patricia Churchland]] and [[Ray Kurzweil]]&lt;/ref&gt; What if the program simulates the sequence of nerve firings at the synapses of an actual brain of an actual Chinese speaker? The man in the room would be simulating an actual brain. This is a variation on the "systems reply" that appears more plausible because "the system" now clearly operates like a human brain, which strengthens the intuition that there is something besides the man in the room that could understand Chinese.
*'''Other minds reply''' and the '''epiphenomena reply''':&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Searle|1980}} under "5. The Other Minds Reply", {{Harvnb|Cole|2004|loc=4.4}}. {{Harvnb|Turing|1950}} makes this reply under "(4) The Argument from Consciousness." Cole ascribes this position to Daniel Dennett and Hans Moravec.&lt;/ref&gt; Several people have noted that Searle's argument is just a version of the [[problem of other minds]], applied to machines. Since it is difficult to decide if people are "actually" thinking, we should not be surprised that it is difficult to answer the same question about machines.

:A related question is whether "consciousness" (as Searle understands it) exists. Searle argues that the experience of consciousness can't be detected by examining the behavior of a machine, a human being or any other animal. [[Daniel Dennett]] points out that natural selection cannot preserve a feature of an animal that has no effect on the behavior of the animal, and thus consciousness (as Searle understands it) can't be produced by natural selection. Therefore either natural selection did not produce consciousness, or "strong AI" is correct in that consciousness can be detected by suitably designed Turing test.

==Is thinking a kind of computation?==
{{Main|computational theory of mind}}

The [[computational theory of mind]] or "[[computationalism]]" claims that the relationship between mind and brain is similar (if not identical) to the relationship between a ''running program'' and a computer. The idea has philosophical roots in [[Hobbes]] (who claimed reasoning was "nothing more than reckoning"), [[Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz|Leibniz]] (who attempted to create a logical calculus of all human ideas), [[David Hume|Hume]] (who thought perception could be reduced to "atomic impressions") and even [[Immanuel Kant|Kant]] (who analyzed all experience as controlled by formal rules).&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Dreyfus|1979|p=156}}, {{Harvnb|Haugeland|1985|pp=15–44}}&lt;/ref&gt; The latest version is associated with philosophers [[Hilary Putnam]] and [[Jerry Fodor]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Horst|2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This question bears on our earlier questions: if the human brain is a kind of computer then computers can be both intelligent and conscious, answering both the practical and philosophical questions of AI. In terms of the practical question of AI ("Can a machine display general intelligence?"), some versions of computationalism make the claim that (as [[Hobbes]] wrote):
* ''Reasoning is nothing but reckoning''&lt;ref name=H/&gt;
In other words, our intelligence derives from a form of ''calculation'', similar to [[arithmetic]]. This is the [[physical symbol system]] hypothesis discussed above, and it implies that artificial intelligence is possible. In terms of the philosophical question of AI ("Can a machine have mind, mental states and consciousness?"), most versions of [[computationalism]] claim that (as [[Stevan Harnad]] characterizes it):
* ''Mental states are just implementations of (the right) computer programs''&lt;ref name=HARNAD&gt;{{Harvnb|Harnad|2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;
This is John Searle's "strong AI" discussed above, and it is the real target of the [[Chinese room]] argument (according to [[Stevan Harnad|Harnad]]).&lt;ref name=HARNAD/&gt;

==Other related questions==

Alan Turing noted that there are many arguments of the form "a machine will never do X", where X can be many things, such as:
&lt;blockquote&gt;Be kind, resourceful, beautiful, friendly, have initiative, have a sense of humor, tell right from wrong, make mistakes, fall in love, enjoy strawberries and cream, make someone fall in love with it, learn from experience, use words properly, be the subject of its own thought, have as much diversity of behaviour as a man, do something really new.&lt;ref name=T5&gt;{{Harvnb|Turing|1950}} under "(5) Arguments from Various Disabilities"&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Turing argues that these objections are often based on naive assumptions about the versatility of machines or are "disguised forms of the argument from consciousness". Writing a program that exhibits one of these behaviors "will not make much of an impression."&lt;ref name=T5/&gt; All of these arguments are tangential to the basic premise of AI, unless it can be shown that one of these traits is essential for general intelligence.

===Can a machine have emotions?===

If "emotions" are defined only in terms of their effect on [[behaviorism|behavior]] or on how they [[function (biology)|function]] inside an organism, then emotions can be viewed as a mechanism that an [[intelligent agent]] uses to maximize the [[utility (economics)|utility]] of its actions. Given this definition of emotion, [[Hans Moravec]] believes that "robots in general will be quite emotional about being nice people".&lt;ref name=CQ266&gt;Quoted in {{Harvnb|Crevier|1993|p=266}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fear is a source of urgency. Empathy is a necessary component of good [[human computer interaction]]. He says robots "will try to please you in an apparently selfless manner because it will get a thrill out of this positive reinforcement. You can interpret this as a kind of love."&lt;ref name=CQ266/&gt; [[Daniel Crevier]] writes "Moravec's point is that emotions are just devices for channeling behavior in a direction beneficial to the survival of one's species."&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Crevier|1993|p=266}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, emotions can also be defined in terms of their [[Subjectivity|subjective]] quality, of what it ''feels like'' to have an emotion. The question of whether the machine ''actually feels'' an emotion, or whether it merely ''acts as if'' it is feeling an emotion is the philosophical question, "can a machine be conscious?" in another form.&lt;ref name=T4/&gt;

===Can a machine be self-aware?===

"Self awareness", as noted above, is sometimes used by [[science fiction]] writers as a name for the [[essentialism|essential]] human property that makes a character fully human. [[Alan Turing|Turing]] strips away all other properties of human beings and reduces the question to "can a machine be the subject of its own thought?" Can it ''think about itself''? Viewed in this way, a program can be written that can report on its own internal states, such as a [[debugger]].&lt;ref name=T5/&gt;  Though arguably self-awareness often presumes a bit more capability; a machine that can ascribe meaning in some way to not only its own state but in general postulating questions without solid answers: the contextual nature of its existence now; how it compares to past states or plans for the future, the limits and value of its work product, how it perceives its performance to be valued-by or compared to others.

===Can a machine be original or creative?===

Turing reduces this to the question of whether a machine can "take us by surprise" and argues that this is obviously true, as any programmer can attest.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Turing|1950}} under "(6) Lady Lovelace's Objection"&lt;/ref&gt; He notes that, with enough storage capacity, a computer can behave in an astronomical number of different ways.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Turing|1950}} under "(5) Argument from Various Disabilities"&lt;/ref&gt; It must be possible, even trivial, for a computer that can represent ideas to combine them in new ways. ([[Douglas Lenat]]'s [[Automated Mathematician]], as one example, combined ideas to discover new mathematical truths.) [[Andreas Kaplan|Kaplan]] and Haenlein suggest that machines can display scientific creativity, while it seems likely that humans will have the upper hand where artistic creativity is concerned.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0007681318301393 Kaplan Andreas; Michael Haenlein (2018) Siri, Siri in my Hand, who's the Fairest in the Land? On the Interpretations, Illustrations and Implications of Artificial Intelligence, Business Horizons, 62(1)]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2009, scientists at Aberystwyth University in Wales and the U.K's University of Cambridge designed a robot called Adam that they believe to be the first machine to independently come up with new scientific findings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Katz |first=Leslie |url=http://news.cnet.com/8301-17938_105-10211175-1.html?tag=newsLatestHeadlinesArea.0 |title=Robo-scientist makes gene discovery-on its own &amp;#124; Crave - CNET |publisher=News.cnet.com |date=2009-04-02 |accessdate=2010-07-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also in 2009, researchers at [[Cornell]] developed [[Eureqa]], a computer program that extrapolates formulas to fit the data inputted, such as finding the laws of motion from a pendulum's motion.

===Can a machine be benevolent or hostile?===
{{Main|ethics of artificial intelligence}}

This question (like many others in the philosophy of artificial intelligence) can be presented in two forms. "Hostility" can be defined in terms [[functionalism (philosophy)|function]] or [[behaviorism|behavior]], in which case "hostile" becomes synonymous with "dangerous". Or it can be defined in terms of intent: can a machine "deliberately" set out to do harm? The latter is the question "can a machine have conscious states?" (such as [[intention]]s) in another form.&lt;ref name=T4/&gt;

The question of whether highly intelligent and completely autonomous machines would be dangerous has been examined in detail by futurists (such as the [[Singularity Institute]]). (The obvious element of drama has also made the subject popular in [[science fiction]], which has considered many differently possible scenarios where intelligent machines pose a threat to mankind.)

One issue is that machines may acquire the autonomy and intelligence required to be dangerous very quickly. [[Vernor Vinge]] has suggested that over just a few years, computers will suddenly become thousands or millions of times more intelligent than humans. He calls this "[[Technological singularity|the Singularity]]."&lt;ref name="nytimes july09"/&gt;  He suggests that it may be somewhat or possibly very dangerous for humans.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20070101133646/http://www-rohan.sdsu.edu/faculty/vinge/misc/singularity.html The Coming Technological Singularity: How to Survive in the Post-Human Era], by Vernor Vinge, Department of Mathematical Sciences, San Diego State University, (c) 1993 by Vernor Vinge.&lt;/ref&gt; This is discussed by a philosophy called [[Singularitarianism]].

In 2009, academics and technical experts attended a conference to discuss the potential impact of robots and computers and the impact of the hypothetical possibility that they could become self-sufficient and able to make their own decisions. They discussed the possibility and the extent to which computers and robots might be able to acquire any level of autonomy, and to what degree they could use such abilities to possibly pose any threat or hazard. They noted that some machines have acquired various forms of semi-autonomy, including being able to find power sources on their own and being able to independently choose targets to attack with weapons. They also noted that some computer viruses can evade elimination and have achieved "cockroach intelligence." They noted that self-awareness as depicted in science-fiction is probably unlikely, but that there were other potential hazards and pitfalls.&lt;ref name="nytimes july09"&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2009/07/26/science/26robot.html?_r=1&amp;ref=todayspaper Scientists Worry Machines May Outsmart Man] By JOHN MARKOFF, NY Times, July 26, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

Some experts and academics have questioned the use of robots for military combat, especially when such robots are given some degree of autonomous functions.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/technology/8182003.stm Call for debate on killer robots], By Jason Palmer, Science and technology reporter, BBC News, 8/3/09.&lt;/ref&gt; The US Navy has funded a report which indicates that as military robots become more complex, there should be greater attention to implications of their ability to make autonomous decisions.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dailytech.com/New%20Navyfunded%20Report%20Warns%20of%20War%20Robots%20Going%20Terminator/article14298.htm Science New Navy-funded Report Warns of War Robots Going "Terminator"], by Jason Mick (Blog), dailytech.com, February 17, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.engadget.com/2009/02/18/navy-report-warns-of-robot-uprising-suggests-a-strong-moral-com/ Navy report warns of robot uprising, suggests a strong moral compass], by Joseph L. Flatley  engadget.com, Feb 18th 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

The President of the [[Association for the Advancement of Artificial Intelligence]] has commissioned a study to look at this issue.&lt;ref&gt;[http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/um/people/horvitz/AAAI_Presidential_Panel_2008-2009.htm AAAI Presidential Panel on Long-Term AI Futures 2008-2009 Study], Association for the Advancement of Artificial Intelligence, Accessed 7/26/09.&lt;/ref&gt; They point to programs like the [[Language Acquisition Device (computer)|Language Acquisition Device]] which can emulate human interaction.

Some have suggested a need to build "[[Friendly AI]]", meaning that the advances which are already occurring with AI should also include an effort to make AI intrinsically friendly and humane.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.asimovlaws.com/articles/archives/2004/07/why_we_need_fri_1.html Article at Asimovlaws.com], July 2004, accessed 7/27/09. {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090630002221/http://www.asimovlaws.com/articles/archives/2004/07/why_we_need_fri_1.html |date=June 30, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Can a machine have a soul?===

Finally, those who believe in the existence of a soul may argue that "Thinking is a function of man's immortal soul." Alan Turing called this "the theological objection". He writes
&lt;blockquote&gt;In attempting to construct such machines we should not be irreverently usurping His power of creating souls, any more than we are in the procreation of children: rather we are, in either case, instruments of His will providing mansions for the souls that He creates.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Turing|1950}} under "(1) The Theological Objection", although it should be noted that he also writes "I am not very impressed with theological arguments whatever they may be used to support"&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Views on the role of philosophy==
Some scholars argue that the AI community's dismissal of philosophy is detrimental. In the ''[[Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy]]'', some philosophers argue that  the role of philosophy in AI is underappreciated.&lt;ref name=sep/&gt; Physicist [[David Deutsch]] argues that without an understanding of philosophy or its concepts, AI development would suffer from a lack of progress.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.theguardian.com/science/2012/oct/03/philosophy-artificial-intelligence|title=Philosophy will be the key that unlocks artificial intelligence {{!}} David Deutsch|last=Deutsch|first=David|date=2012-10-03|website=the Guardian|language=en|access-date=2018-09-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7835">'''Phonemic awareness''' is a subset of [[phonological awareness]] in which listeners are able to hear, identify and manipulate [[phonemes]], the smallest mental units of [[sound]] that helps to differentiate units of meaning ([[morphemes]]). Separating the spoken word "cat" into three distinct phonemes, [[Voiceless velar stop|{{IPA|/k/}}]], [[Near-open front unrounded vowel|{{IPA|/æ/}}]], and [[Voiceless dental and alveolar stops|{{IPA|/t/}}]], requires phonemic awareness. However, phonemes could not be separated like notes in a song or could be identified in isolation.
The [[National Reading Panel]] has found that phonemic awareness improves children's word [[Reading (process)|reading]] and [[reading comprehension]], as well as helping children learn to spell.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nichd.nih.gov/publications/nrp/findings.cfm |title=Findings and Determinations of the National Reading Panel by Topic Areas |format= |work=NICHD |accessdate= |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080705194256/http://www.nichd.nih.gov/publications/nrp/findings.cfm |archivedate=2008-07-05 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Phonemic awareness is the basis for learning [[phonics]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.readingonline.org/critical/shanahan/panel.html |title=Critical Issues: The National Reading Panel |work=Reading Online |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Phonemic awareness and phonological awareness are often confused since they are interdependent. Phonemic awareness is the ability to hear and manipulate individual phonemes. Phonological awareness includes this ability, but it also includes the ability to hear and manipulate larger units of sound, such as [[Syllable_onset#Onset|onset]]s and [[syllable rime|rime]]s and [[syllable]]s.

Studies by Vickie Snider have shown that phonemic awareness has a direct correlation with students' ability to read as they get older.  Phonemic awareness builds a foundation for students to understand the rules of the English language.  This in turn allows each student to apply these skills and increase his or her oral [[Fluency|reading fluency]] and understanding of the text.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| last = Snider | first = Vicki E. | title = The Relationship between Phonemic Awareness and Later Reading Achievement | jstor = 27542094 | publisher =  JSTOR | year =  1997 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A research study done by Robert Johnson and Gregory Tweedie applying direct Phonemic Awareness (PA) instruction to young English as a Foreign Language (EFL) learners in rural Malaysia showed that those children educated by PA achieved significantly greater test scores than the control group. PA accelerated the acquisition of relevant literacy and numeracy skills in this case. It also suggested that PA might help close the literacy and numeracy education gap between urban pre-school attender and rural non attender children. However, this enhancement needs to be validated by further research.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Johnson|first=R. C.|last2=Tweedie|first2=M.

Despite the substantial gains in vowel recognition, a downside of using PA, not in this study, is that adult ELLs may negatively perceive PA as a "childish" approach.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Tweedie|first=|last2=Johnson|first2=|last3=et al.|date=|year=2015|title=Direct phonemic awareness instruction as a means of improving academic text comprehension for adult English language learners.|url=https://journalhosting.ucalgary.ca/index.php/jet/article/view/44221/31659|journal=Journal of Educational Thought|volume=48|issue=1-2|pages=81-102|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Phonemic awareness relates to the ability to distinguish and manipulate individual sounds, such as {{IPA|/f/}}, {{IPA|/ʊ/}}, and {{IPA|/t/}} in the case of ''foot''. The following are common phonemic awareness skills practiced with students:
* Phoneme isolation: which requires recognizing the individual sounds in words, for example, "Tell me the first sound you hear in the word paste" ({{IPA|/p/}}).
* Phoneme identity: which requires recognizing the common sound in different words, for example, "Tell me the sound that is the same in bike, boy and bell" ({{IPA|/b/}}).
* Phoneme substitution: in which one can turn a word (such as "cat") into another (such as "hat") by substituting one phoneme (such as {{IPA|/h/}}) for another ({{IPA|/k/}}).  Phoneme substitution can take place for initial sounds (cat-hat), middle sounds (cat-cut) or ending sounds (cat-cap).
* Oral segmenting: The teacher says a word, for example, "ball," and students say the individual sounds, {{IPA|/b/}}, {{IPA|/ɔː/}}, and {{IPA|/l/}}.
* Oral blending: The teacher says each sound, for example, "{{IPA|/b/, /ɔː/, /l/}}" and students respond with the word, "ball".
* Sound deletion: The teacher says a word, has students repeat it, and then instructs students to repeat the word without the first sound. For example, the teacher might say "now say 'bill' without the {{IPA|/b/}}", which students should respond to with "ill".
* Onset-rime manipulation: which requires isolation, identification, segmentation, blending, or deletion of onsets (the single consonant or blend that precedes the vowel and following consonants), for example, j-ump, st-op, str-ong. 
There are other phonemic awareness activities, such as sound substitution, where students are instructed to replace one sound with another; sound addition, where students add sounds to words; and sound switching, where students manipulate the order of the phonemes. These are more complex but research supports the use of the three listed above, particularly oral segmenting and oral blending.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | last = Yopp | first = Hallie K. | title = Developing Phonemic Awareness in Young Children | publisher = The Reading Teacher Vol. 45, No. 9, 1992 A Journal of the International Reading Association | url = http://www.reading.org/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="31562">A '''phytoestrogen''' is a  plant-derived [[xenoestrogen]] (see [[estrogen]]) not generated within the [[endocrine system]], but consumed by eating phytoestrogenic plants. Also called a "dietary estrogen", it is a diverse group of naturally occurring  nonsteroidal plant compounds that, because of its structural similarity with [[estradiol]] (17-β-estradiol), have the ability to cause [[estrogenic]] and/or antiestrogenic effects.&lt;ref name= "Yil"&gt;{{cite book | last = Yildiz | first = Fatih | name-list-format = vanc | title = Phytoestrogens in Functional Foods| publisher = Taylor &amp; Francis Ltd | year = 2005 |pages = 3–5, 210–211 | isbn  = 978-1-57444-508-4 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Phytoestrogens are not essential [[nutrient]]s because their absence from the diet does not cause a disease, nor are they known to participate in any normal biological function.&lt;ref name= "Yil"/&gt;

Its name comes from the [[Greek language|Greek]] ''phyto'' ("plant") and ''estrogen'', the hormone which gives fertility to [[female mammals]]. The word "[[estrus]]" - Greek οίστρος - means "[[sexual desire]]", and "gene" - Greek γόνο - is "to generate". It has been hypothesized that plants use a phytoestrogen as part of their natural defence against the overpopulation of herbivore animals by controlling female fertility.&lt;ref name="pmid3203635"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Hughes CL | title = Phytochemical mimicry of reproductive hormones and modulation of herbivore fertility by phytoestrogens | journal = Environmental Health Perspectives | volume = 78 | issue =  | pages = 171–4 | date = Jun 1988 | pmid = 3203635 | pmc = 1474615 | doi = 10.1289/ehp.8878171 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="isbn0-521-64387-2"&gt;{{cite book | last1 = Bentley | first1 = Gillian R. | last2 = Mascie-Taylor | first2 = C.

The similarities, at molecular level, of a [[estrogen]] and a phytoestrogen allow them to mildly mimic and sometimes act as a antagonist of [[estrogen]].&lt;ref name= "Yil"/&gt; Phytoestrogens were first observed in 1926,&lt;ref name= "Yil"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last1 = Varner | first1 = JE | last2 = Bonner | first2 = J | name-list-format = vanc | title =  Plant Biochemistry| publisher = Academic Press| year = 1966 | isbn = 978-0-12-114856-0  }}&lt;/ref&gt; but it was unknown if they could have any effect in human or animal metabolism.

[[File:Phytoestrogens2.png|thumb|Chemical structures of the most common phytoestrogens found in plants (top and middle) compared with estrogen (bottom) found in animals.|400px|right]]

== Structure ==

Phytoestrogens mainly belong to a large group of substituted [[natural phenol]]ic compounds: the [[coumestan]]s, [[prenylflavonoid]]s and [[isoflavone]]s are three of the most active in estrogenic effects in this class. The best-researched are isoflavones, which are commonly found in [[soy]] and [[red clover]]. [[Lignan]]s have also been identified as phytoestrogens, although they are not flavonoids.&lt;ref name= "Yil"/&gt; [[Mycoestrogens]] have similar structures and effects, but are not components of plants; these are mold metabolites of ''[[Fusarium]]'', especially common on cereal grains,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Bennett GA, Shotwell OI | year = 1979 | title =  Zearalenone in cereal grains | journal = J.

== Mechanism of action ==

Phytoestrogens exert their effects primarily through binding to [[estrogen receptor]]s (ER).&lt;ref name="pmid17518366"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Turner JV, Agatonovic-Kustrin S, Glass BD | title = Molecular aspects of phytoestrogen selective binding at estrogen receptors | journal = Journal of Pharmaceutical Sciences | volume = 96 | issue = 8 | pages = 1879–85 | date = Aug 2007 | pmid = 17518366 | doi = 10.1002/jps.20987 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  There are two variants of the estrogen receptor, alpha ([[estrogen receptor alpha|ER-α]]) and beta ([[estrogen receptor beta|ER-β]]) and many phytoestrogens display somewhat higher [[Ligand (biochemistry)#Receptor/ligand binding affinity|affinity]] for ER-β compared to ER-α.&lt;ref name="pmid17518366"/&gt;

The key structural elements that enable phytoestrogens to bind with high affinity to estrogen receptors and display estradiol-like effects are:&lt;ref name= "Yil"/&gt;
*The phenolic ring that is indispensable for binding to estrogen receptor
*The ring of isoflavones mimicking a ring of estrogens at the receptors binding site
*Low molecular weight similar to estrogens (MW=272)
*Distance between two hydroxyl groups at the isoflavones nucleus similar to that occurring in estradiol
*Optimal hydroxylation pattern

In addition to interaction with ERs, phytoestrogens may also modulate the concentration of endogenous estrogens by binding or inactivating some enzymes, and may affect the bioavailability of sex hormones by depressing or stimulating the synthesis of sex hormone-binding globulin (SHBG).&lt;ref name= "Jon"/&gt;

Emerging evidence shows that some phytoestrogens bind to and transactivate [[peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor]]s (PPARs).&lt;ref name="pmid15922618"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Dang ZC, Lowik C | title = Dose-dependent effects of phytoestrogens on bone | journal = Trends in Endocrinology and Metabolism | volume = 16 | issue = 5 | pages = 207–13 | date = Jul 2005 | pmid = 15922618 | doi = 10.1016/j.tem.2005.05.001 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid19207876"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Dang ZC | title = Dose-dependent effects of soy phyto-oestrogen genistein on adipocytes: mechanisms of action | journal = Obesity Reviews | volume = 10 | issue = 3 | pages = 342–9 | date = May 2009 | pmid = 19207876 | doi = 10.1111/j.1467-789X.2008.00554.x }}&lt;/ref&gt; In vitro studies show an activation of PPARs at concentrations above 1 μM, which is higher than the activation level of ERs.&lt;ref name="pmid12421816"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Dang ZC, Audinot V, Papapoulos SE, Boutin JA, Löwik CW | title = Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPARgamma ) as a molecular target for the soy phytoestrogen genistein | journal = The Journal of Biological Chemistry | volume = 278 | issue = 2 | pages = 962–7 | date = Jan 2003 | pmid = 12421816 | doi = 10.1074/jbc.M209483200 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid15068509"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Dang Z, Löwik CW | title = The balance between concurrent activation of ERs and PPARs determines daidzein-induced osteogenesis and adipogenesis | journal = Journal of Bone and Mineral Research | volume = 19 | issue = 5 | pages = 853–61 | date = May 2004 | pmid = 15068509 | doi = 10.1359/jbmr.040120 }}&lt;/ref&gt; At the concentration below 1 μM, activation of ERs may play a dominant role. At higher concentrations (&gt;1 μM), both ERs and PPARs are activated. Studies have shown that both ERs and PPARs influence each other and therefore induce differential effects in a dose-dependent way. The final biological effects of genistein are determined by the balance among these pleiotrophic actions.&lt;ref name="pmid15922618"/&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid19207876"/&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid12421816"/&gt;

These compounds in plants are an important part of their defense system, mainly against fungi.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | first1 = Richard C. | last1 = Leegood | first2 = Per | last2 = Lea | name-list-format = vanc | title = Plant Biochemistry and Molecular Biology| publisher = John Wiley &amp; Sons | year = 1998 | isbn = 978-0-471-97683-7| page = 211 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Phytoestrogens are ancient naturally occurring substances, and as dietary phytochemicals they are considered as co-evolutive with mammals. In the human diet, phytoestrogens are not the only source of exogenous estrogens. [[Xenoestrogens]] (novel, man-made), are found as [[food additive]]s&lt;ref name="pmid19063592"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Amadasi A, Mozzarelli A, Meda C, Maggi A, Cozzini P | title = Identification of xenoestrogens in food additives by an integrated in silico and in vitro approach | journal = Chem.

Environmentally, they have similar effects as phytoestrogens, making it difficult to clearly separate the action of these two kind of agents in studies done on populations.&lt;ref name= "Repro"&gt;{{cite book | last = Korach | first = Kenneth S. | name-list-format = vanc | title = Reproductive and Developmental Toxicology | publisher = Marcel Dekker Ltd | year  =1998 | pages =  278–279| isbn = 978-0-8247-9857-4 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Avian studies==
The consumption of plants with unusual content of phytoestrogens under drought conditions, has been shown to decrease fertility in quail.&lt;ref name="pmid1246602"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Leopold AS, Erwin M, Oh J, Browning B | title = Phytoestrogens: adverse effects on reproduction in California quail | journal = Science | volume = 191 | issue = 4222 | pages = 98–100 | date = January 1976 | pmid = 1246602 | doi = 10.1126/science.1246602 | url = http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&amp;pmid=1246602 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Parrot food as available in nature has shown only weak estrogenic activity. Studies have been conducted on screening methods for environmental estrogens present in manufactured supplementary food, with the purpose to enable reproduction of endangered species.&lt;ref name="pmid11302429"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Fidler AE, Zwart S, Pharis RP, Weston RJ, Lawrence SB, Jansen P, Elliott G, Merton DV | title = Screening the foods of an endangered parrot, the kakapo (Strigops habroptilus), for oestrogenic activity using a recombinant yeast bioassay | journal = Reproduction, Fertility, and Development | volume = 12 | issue = 3–4 | pages = 191–9 | year = 2000 | pmid = 11302429 | doi = 10.1071/RD00041 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Food sources ==

According to one study of nine common phytoestrogens in a Western diet, foods with the highest relative phytoestrogen content were nuts and oilseeds, followed by soy products, cereals and breads, [[legume]]s, meat products, and other processed foods that may contain soy, vegetables, fruits, alcoholic, and nonalcoholic beverages. [[Flax]] seed and other oilseeds contained the highest total phytoestrogen content, followed by soybeans and [[tofu]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Thompson LU, Boucher BA, Liu Z, Cotterchio M, Kreiger N | title = Phytoestrogen content of foods consumed in Canada, including isoflavones, lignans, and coumestan | journal = Nutrition and Cancer | volume = 54 | issue = 2 | pages = 184–201 | year = 2006 | pmid = 16898863 | doi = 10.1207/s15327914nc5402_5 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The highest concentrations of isoflavones are found in soybeans and soybean products followed by legumes, whereas lignans are the primary source of phytoestrogens found in nuts and oilseeds (e.g. flax) and also found in cereals, legumes, fruits and vegetables. Phytoestrogen content varies in different foods, and may vary significantly within the same group of foods (e.g. soy beverages, tofu) depending on processing mechanisms and type of soybean used. Legumes (in particular soybeans), whole grain cereals, and some seeds are high in phytoestrogens.

An epidemiological study of women in the United States found that the dietary intake of phytoestrogens in healthy post-menopausal Caucasian women is less than one milligram daily.&lt;ref name="pmid11385074"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = de Kleijn MJ, van der Schouw YT, Wilson PW, Adlercreutz H, Mazur W, Grobbee DE, Jacques PF | title = Intake of dietary phytoestrogens is low in postmenopausal women in the United States: the Framingham study(1-4) | journal = The Journal of Nutrition | volume = 131 | issue = 6 | pages = 1826–32 | date = Jun 2001 | pmid = 11385074 | doi =  | url = http://jn.nutrition.org/cgi/content/abstract/131/6/1826 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Effects on humans ==
&lt;!-- "Isoflavones" links here --&gt;
In human beings, phytoestrogens are readily absorbed into the circulatory system, circulate in plasma, and are excreted in the urine. Metabolic influence is different from that of grazing animals due to the differences between ruminant versus monogastric digestive systems.&lt;ref name= "Repro"/&gt;

A wide range of beneficial effects of phytoestrogens on the [[cardiovascular]], [[metabolic]], [[central nervous system|central nervous]] systems as well as reduction of risk of cancer and [[post menopausal]] symptoms have been claimed. However, there is also concern that phytoestrogens may act as [[endocrine disruptor]]s that adversely affect health. Based on currently available evidence, it is not clear whether the potential health benefits of phytoestrogens outweigh their risks.&lt;ref name="Rietjens_2017"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Rietjens IM, Louisse J, Beekmann K | title = The potential health effects of dietary phytoestrogens | journal = British Journal of Pharmacology | volume = 174 | issue = 11 | pages = 1263–1280 | date = June 2017 | pmid = 27723080 | pmc = 5429336 | doi = 10.1111/bph.13622 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Males ===

It is unclear if phytoestrogens have any effect on male sexuality, with conflicting results about the potential effects of isoflavones originating from soy. A 2010 [[meta-analysis]] of fifteen placebo-controlled studies said that "neither soy foods nor isoflavone supplements alter measures of bioavailable [[testosterone]] concentrations in men."&lt;ref name="hamilton_et_al"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Hamilton-Reeves JM, Vazquez G, Duval SJ, Phipps WR, Kurzer MS, Messina MJ | title = Clinical studies show no effects of soy protein or isoflavones on reproductive hormones in men: results of a meta-analysis | journal = Fertility and Sterility | volume = 94 | issue = 3 | pages = 997–1007 | date = Aug 2010 | pmid = 19524224 | doi = 10.1016/j.fertnstert.2009.04.038 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Some studies showed that isoflavone supplementation had no effect on sperm concentration, count, or [[motility]], and had no effects on testicular or ejaculate volume.&lt;ref name= "tox"&gt;{{cite book | last = Dabrowski| first = Waldemar M. | name-list-format = vanc | title = Toxins in Food | publisher = CRC Press Inc | year = 2004 | isbn = 978-0-8493-1904-4 | page = 95 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid11352776"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Mitchell JH, Cawood E, Kinniburgh D, Provan A, Collins AR, Irvine DS | title = Effect of a phytoestrogen food supplement on reproductive health in normal males | journal = Clinical Science | volume = 100 | issue = 6 | pages = 613–8 | date = Jun 2001 | pmid = 11352776 | doi = 10.1042/CS20000212 | url = http://www.clinsci.org/content/100/6/613 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Sperm count decline and increasing rate of testicular cancers in the West may be linked to a higher presence of isoflavone phytoestrogens in the diet, but such a link has not been definitively proven.&lt;ref name="pmid20347861"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Patisaul HB, Jefferson W | title = The pros and cons of phytoestrogens | journal = Frontiers in Neuroendocrinology | volume = 31 | issue = 4 | pages = 400–19 | year = 2010 | pmid = 20347861 | pmc = 3074428 | doi = 10.1016/j.yfrne.2010.03.003 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, there is some evidence that phytoestrogens may affect male fertility, but "further investigation is needed before a firm conclusion can be drawn".&lt;ref name="pmid19919579"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Cederroth CR, Auger J, Zimmermann C, Eustache F, Nef S | title = Soy, phyto-oestrogens and male reproductive function: a review | journal = International Journal of Andrology | volume = 33 | issue = 2 | pages = 304–16 | year = 2010 | pmid = 19919579 | doi = 10.1111/j.1365-2605.2009.01011.x }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Infant formula ===

Some studies have found that some concentrations of isoflavones may have effects on intestinal cells. At low doses, genistein acted as a weak estrogen and stimulated cell growth; at high doses, it inhibited proliferation and altered cell cycle dynamics. This biphasic response correlates with how genistein is thought to exert its effects.&lt;ref name="pmid15173388"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Chen AC, Donovan SM | title = Genistein at a concentration present in soy infant formula inhibits Caco-2BBe cell proliferation by causing G2/M cell cycle arrest | journal = The Journal of Nutrition | volume = 134 | issue = 6 | pages = 1303–8 | date = Jun 2004 | pmid = 15173388 | doi =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="19790">'''Psychoacoustics''' is the scientific study of [[sound]] [[perception]] and audiology – how humans perceive various sounds. More specifically, it is the branch of science studying the [[psychological]] and [[physiological]] responses associated with sound (including [[noise]], [[speech]] and [[music]]). It can be further categorized as a branch of [[psychophysics]]. Psychoacoustics received its name from a field within psychology—i.e., recognition science—which deals with all kinds of human perceptions. It is an interdisciplinary field of many areas, including psychology, acoustics, electronic engineering, physics, biology, physiology, and computer science.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Ballou|first1=G|title=Handbook for Sound Engineers|date=2008|publisher=Burlington: Focal Press|page=43|edition=Fourth}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==

Hearing is not a purely mechanical phenomenon of [[wave propagation]], but is also a sensory and perceptual event; in other words, when a person hears something, that something arrives at the [[ear]] as a mechanical sound wave traveling through the air, but within the ear it is transformed into neural [[action potentials]]. The outer hair cells (OHC) of a mammalian [[cochlea]] give rise to an enhanced sensitivity and better{{clarify|date=May 2018}} frequency resolution of the mechanical response of the cochlear partition. These nerve pulses then travel to the brain where they are perceived. Hence, in many problems in acoustics, such as for [[Auditory system|audio processing]], it is advantageous to take into account not just the mechanics of the environment, but also the fact that both the ear and the brain are involved in a person’s listening experience.

The [[inner ear]], for example, does significant [[signal processing]] in converting sound [[waveform]]s into neural stimuli, so certain differences between waveforms may be imperceptible.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title = The Sense of Hearing | author = Christopher J. Plack | publisher = Routledge | year = 2005 | isbn = 978-0-8058-4884-7 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=DoGzm3soUoMC&amp;pg=PA65&amp;dq=ear+hearing+cochlea++inauthor:plack }}&lt;/ref&gt;   [[Data compression]] techniques, such as [[MP3]], make use of this fact.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title = The Sound Blaster Live! Book |author1=Lars Ahlzen |author2=Clarence Song | publisher = No Starch Press | year = 2003 | isbn = 978-1-886411-73-9 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=tKO-truWww8C&amp;pg=PA310&amp;dq=mp3++imperceptible+ear }}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, the ear has a nonlinear response to sounds of different intensity levels; this nonlinear response is called [[loudness]]. [[Telephone network]]s and audio [[noise reduction]] systems make use of this fact by nonlinearly compressing data samples before transmission, and then expanding them for playback.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title = Modern dictionary of electronics | author = Rudolf F. Graf | publisher = Newnes | year = 1999 | isbn = 978-0-7506-9866-5 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=o2I1JWPpdusC&amp;pg=PA137&amp;dq=compression+expansion+noise-reduction+telephone }}&lt;/ref&gt;    Another effect of the ear's nonlinear response is that sounds that are close in frequency produce phantom beat notes, or [[intermodulation]] distortion products.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title = Handbook of Clinical Audiology |author1=Jack Katz |author2=Robert F. Burkard |author3=Larry Medwetsky  |last-author-amp=yes | publisher = Lippincott Williams &amp; Wilkins | year = 2002 | isbn = 978-0-683-30765-8 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=Aj6nVIegE6AC&amp;pg=PA43&amp;dq=beat+distortion++ear }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term "psychoacoustics" also arises in discussions about cognitive psychology and the effects that personal expectations, prejudices, and predispositions may have on listeners' relative evaluations and comparisons of sonic aesthetics and acuity and on listeners' varying determinations about the relative qualities of various musical instruments and performers. The expression that one "hears what one wants (or expects) to hear" may pertain in such discussions.{{Citation needed|date=September 2015}}

== Limits of perception ==
[[File:Perceived Human Hearing.svg|thumb|An [[equal-loudness contour]]. Note peak sensitivity around {{nowrap|2–4 kHz,}} in the middle of the [[Voice frequency|voice frequency band]].]]

The human ear can nominally hear sounds in the range {{nowrap|20 [[Hertz|Hz]]}} {{nowrap|(0.02 kHz)}} to {{nowrap|20,000 Hz}} {{nowrap|(20 kHz).}}  The upper limit tends to decrease with age; most adults are unable to hear above 16&amp;nbsp;kHz. The lowest frequency that has been identified as a musical tone is 12&amp;nbsp;Hz under ideal laboratory conditions.&lt;ref name=Olson&gt;{{cite book |title=Music, Physics and Engineering |last=Olson |first=Harry F. |authorlink=Harry F. Olson |year= 1967|publisher=Dover Publications |pages=248–251 |isbn=978-0-486-21769-7 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=RUDTFBbb7jAC }}&lt;/ref&gt; Tones between 4 and 16&amp;nbsp;Hz can be perceived via the body's [[sense of touch]].

Frequency resolution of the ear is 3.6&amp;nbsp;Hz within the octave of {{nowrap|1000 – 2000 Hz.}}  That is, changes in pitch larger than 3.6&amp;nbsp;Hz can be perceived in a clinical setting.&lt;ref name=Olson&gt;{{cite book |title=Music, Physics and Engineering |last=Olson |first=Harry F. |authorlink=Harry F. Olson |year= 1967|publisher=Dover Publications |pages=248–251 |isbn=978-0-486-21769-7 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=RUDTFBbb7jAC }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, even smaller pitch differences can be perceived through other means. For example, the interference of two pitches can often be heard as a repetitive variation in volume of the tone. This amplitude modulation occurs with a frequency equal to the difference in frequencies of the two tones and is known as [[beat (acoustics)|beating]].

The [[semitone]] scale used in Western musical notation is not a linear frequency scale but [[Logarithmic scale|logarithmic]]. Other scales have been derived directly from experiments on human hearing perception, such as the [[mel scale]] and [[Bark scale]] (these are used in studying perception, but not usually in musical composition), and these are approximately logarithmic in frequency at the high-frequency end, but nearly linear at the low-frequency end.

The intensity range of audible sounds is enormous. Human ear drums are sensitive to variations in the sound pressure, and can detect pressure changes from as small as a few [[micropascal]]s (µPa) to greater than {{nowrap|100 [[Pascal (unit)|kPa]].}}  For this reason, [[sound pressure|sound pressure level]] is also measured logarithmically, with all pressures referenced to {{nowrap|20 [[Pascal (unit)|µPa]]}} (or 1.97385&amp;times;10&lt;sup&gt;−10&lt;/sup&gt; [[atmosphere (unit)|atm]]). The lower limit of audibility is therefore defined as {{nowrap|0 [[decibel|dB]],}} but the upper limit is not as clearly defined. The upper limit is more a question of the limit where the ear will be physically harmed or with the potential to cause [[noise-induced hearing loss]].

A more rigorous exploration of the lower limits of audibility determines that the minimum threshold at which a sound can be heard is frequency dependent.  By measuring this minimum intensity for testing tones of various frequencies, a frequency dependent [[absolute threshold of hearing]] (ATH) curve may be derived.  Typically, the ear shows a peak of sensitivity (i.e., its lowest ATH) between {{nowrap|1–5 kHz,}} though the threshold changes with age, with older ears showing decreased sensitivity above 2&amp;nbsp;kHz.&lt;ref name=Fastl&gt;{{cite book |title=Psychoacoustics: Facts and Models |last=Fastl |first=Hugo | last2=Zwicker| first2=Eberhard |year= 2006 |publisher=Springer |pages=21–22 |isbn=978-3-540-23159-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ATH is the lowest of the [[equal-loudness contour]]s. Equal-loudness contours indicate the sound pressure level (dB SPL), over the range of audible frequencies, that are perceived as being of equal loudness.  Equal-loudness contours were first measured by Fletcher and Munson at [[Bell Labs]] in 1933 using pure tones reproduced via headphones, and the data they collected are called [[Fletcher–Munson curves]].  Because subjective loudness was difficult to measure, the Fletcher–Munson curves were averaged over many subjects.

Robinson and Dadson refined the process in 1956 to obtain a new set of equal-loudness curves for a frontal sound source measured in an [[anechoic chamber]]. The Robinson-Dadson curves were standardized as [[International Organization for Standardization|ISO]] 226 in 1986. In 2003, {{nowrap|ISO 226}} was revised as [[equal-loudness contour]] using data collected from 12 international studies.

==Sound localization==
{{Main|Sound localization}}

[[Sound localization]] is the process of determining the location of a sound source. The brain utilizes subtle differences in loudness, tone and timing between the two ears to allow us to localize sound sources.&lt;ref name="Thompson"&gt;Thompson, Daniel M. Understanding Audio: Getting the Most out of Your Project or Professional Recording Studio. Boston, MA: Berklee, 2005. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; Localization can be described in terms of three-dimensional position: the [[azimuth]] or horizontal angle, the [[zenith]] or vertical angle, and the distance (for static sounds) or velocity (for moving sounds).&lt;ref name="Roads"&gt;Roads, Curtis. The Computer Music Tutorial. Cambridge, MA: MIT, 2007. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; Humans, as most [[tetrapoda|four-legged animals]], are adept at detecting direction in the horizontal, but less so in the vertical due to the ears being placed symmetrically. Some species of [[owls]] have their ears placed asymmetrically, and can detect sound in all three planes, an adaption to hunt small mammals in the dark.&lt;ref&gt;Lewis, D.P. (2007): Owl ears and hearing. Owl Pages [Online]. Available: http://www.owlpages.com/articles.php?section=Owl+Physiology&amp;title=Hearing [2011, April 5]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Masking effects ==
{{Unreferenced section|date=June 2016}}
{{Main|Auditory masking}}

[[File:Audio Mask Graph.png|thumb|Audio masking graph]]Suppose a listener cannot hear a given acoustical signal under silent condition. When a signal is playing while another sound is being played (a masker) the signal has to be stronger for the listener to hear it. The masker does not need to have the frequency components of the original signal for masking to happen. A masked signal can be heard even though it is weaker than the masker. Masking happens when a signal and a masker are played together. It also happens when a masker starts after a signal stops playing. The effects of backward masking is weaker than forward masking. The masking effect has been widely used in psychoacoustical research. With masking you can change the levels of the masker and measure the threshold, then create a diagram of a psychophysical tuning curve that will reveal similar features. Masking effects are also used for audio encoding. The masking effect is used in lossy encoders. It can eliminate some of the weaker sounds, so the listener can not hear the difference. This technique has been used in MP3's.

== Missing fundamental ==
{{Main|Missing fundamental}}

When presented with a [[Harmonic series (music)|harmonic series]] of frequencies in the relationship 2''f'', 3''f'', 4''f'', 5''f'', etc. (where ''f'' is a specific frequency), humans tend to perceive that the pitch is ''f''.

== Software ==&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[MPEG-1 Audio Layer II]] --&gt;
[[File:Acustic Block Diagram.svg|thumb|Perceptual audio coding uses psychoacoustics-based algorithms.]]

The psychoacoustic model provides for high quality [[lossy data compression|lossy signal compression]] by describing which parts of a given digital audio signal can be removed (or aggressively compressed) safely—that is, without significant losses in the (consciously) perceived quality of the sound.

It can explain how a sharp clap of the hands might seem painfully loud in a quiet library, but is hardly noticeable after a car backfires on a busy, urban street.  This provides great benefit to the overall compression ratio, and psychoacoustic analysis routinely leads to compressed music files that are 1/10th to 1/12th the size of high quality masters, but with discernibly less proportional quality loss. Such compression is a feature of nearly all modern lossy audio compression formats. Some of these formats include [[Dolby Digital]] (AC-3), [[MP3]], [[Opus (audio format)|Opus]], [[Ogg Vorbis]], [[Advanced Audio Coding|AAC]], [[Windows Media Audio|WMA]], [[MPEG-1 Layer II]] (used for [[digital audio broadcasting]] in several countries) and [[ATRAC]], the compression used in [[MiniDisc]] and some [[Walkman]] models.

Psychoacoustics is based heavily on [[human anatomy]], especially the ear's limitations in perceiving sound as outlined previously.  To summarize, these limitations are:

*[[High frequency limit]]
*[[Absolute threshold of hearing]]
*[[Temporal masking]]
*[[Simultaneous masking]]

Given that the ear will not be at peak perceptive capacity when dealing with these limitations, a compression algorithm can assign a lower priority to sounds outside the range of human hearing.  By carefully shifting bits away from the unimportant components and toward the important ones, the algorithm ensures that the sounds a listener is most likely to perceive are of the highest quality.

== Music ==
Psychoacoustics includes topics and studies that are relevant to [[music psychology]] and [[music therapy]]. Theorists such as [[Benjamin Boretz]] consider some of the results of psychoacoustics to be meaningful only in a musical context.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Sterne|first=Jonathan|title=The Audible Past: Cultural Origins of Sound Reproduction|year=2003|publisher=Duke University Press|location=Durham}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Irv Teibel]]'s ''[[Environments (album series)|Environments series]]'' LPs (1969–79) are an early example of commercially available sounds released expressly for enhancing psychological abilities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Cummings|first1=Jim|title=Irv Teibel died this week: Creator of 1970s "Environments" LPs|url=http://earthear.com/blog/archives/198|website=Earth Ear|accessdate=18 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Applied psychoacoustics ==
[[File:Psychoacoustic Model.svg|thumb|Psychoacoustics Model]]

Psychoacoustics has long enjoyed a symbiotic relationship with [[computer science]], [[computer engineering]], and [[computer network]]ing. Internet pioneers [[J. C. R. Licklider]] and [[Robert Taylor (computer scientist)|Bob Taylor]] both completed graduate-level work in psychoacoustics, while [[BBN Technologies]] originally specialized in consulting on acoustics issues before it began building the first [[Packet-switching|packet-switched]] computer networks.

Licklider wrote a paper entitled "A duplex theory of pitch perception".&lt;ref name="Raychel Rappold"&gt;{{cite book |url=http://www.cs.rit.edu/~rpretc/imm/project1/biography.html|first = Raychel |last=Rappold|title=Biography|publisher=Rochester University|accessdate=2015-08-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Psychoacoustics is applied within many fields from software development, where developers map proven and experimental mathematical patterns; in digital signal processing, where many audio compression codecs such as [[MP3]] and [[Opus (audio format)|Opus]] use a psychoacoustic model to increase compression ratios; in the design of (high end) audio systems for accurate reproduction of music in theatres and homes; as well as defense systems where scientists have experimented with limited success in creating new acoustic weapons, which emit frequencies that may impair, harm, or kill.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nationaldefensemagazine.org/archive/2002/March/Pages/Acoustic-Energy4112.aspx |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-02-06 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100719122933/http://www.nationaldefensemagazine.org/archive/2002/March/Pages/Acoustic-Energy4112.aspx |archivedate=2010-07-19 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is also applied today within music, where musicians and artists continue to create new auditory experiences by masking unwanted frequencies of instruments, causing other frequencies to be enhanced. Yet another application is in the design of small or lower-quality loudspeakers, which can use the phenomenon of [[missing fundamental]]s to give the effect of bass notes at lower frequencies than the loudspeakers are physically able to produce (see references).

'''''Public Opinion''''' is a book by [[Walter Lippmann]], published in 1922. It is a critical assessment of functional democratic government, especially of the irrational and often self-serving social perceptions that influence individual behavior and prevent optimal [[Group cohesiveness|societal cohesion]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

==Pseudo-environment==
The introduction describes man's inability to interpret the world: "The real environment is altogether too big, too complex, and too fleeting for direct acquaintance" between people and their environment. People construct a pseudo-environment that is a subjective, biased, and necessarily abridged [[mental image]] of the world, and to a degree, everyone's pseudo-environment is a fiction. People "live in the same world, but they think and feel in different ones."

Human behavior is stimulated by the person's pseudo-environment and then is acted upon in the real world. Some of the general implications of the interactions among one's psychology, environment, and the [[mass media|mass communications media]] are highlighted.

==News and truth==
By definition, pertinent facts are never provided completely and accurately; by necessity they are arranged to portray a certain, subjective interpretation of an event. Those who are most familiar with the greatest amount of facts regarding a certain environment, construct a pseudo-environment that aligns with their own 'stereotypes' and convey this to the public, knowingly or not, to suit their own private needs. This is inescapable human nature. [[Propaganda]] is inherently impossible without a barrier of [[censorship]] between the event and the public. As a consequence, the mass communication media, by their very nature as vehicles for informational transmission, are essentially vulnerable to manipulation.

The blame for that perceptual [[parallax]] falls not upon the mass media [[technology]] (print, radio, cinema, or, inferentially, television) or logistical concerns but upon certain members of society who attend to life with little [[intellectualism|intellectual]] engagement. That causes the following:

#The buying public: the "bewildered herd" (a term here borrowed from [[The Phantom Public]]) must pay for understanding the unseen environment by the mass communications media. The irony is that although the public's opinion is important, it must pay for its acceptance. People will be selective and will buy the most factual media at the lowest price: "For a dollar, you may not even get an armful of candy, but for a dollar or less people expect reality/representations of truth to fall into their laps." The media have the social function of transmitting [[public policy|public affairs]] information  and their business [[profit (economics)|profit]] role of surviving in the market.
#Nature of news: people publish already-confirmed news that are thus less disputable. Officially-available public matters will constitute "the news" and unofficial (private) matters are unavailable, are less available, or are used as "issues" for propaganda.
#News truth and conclusion: the function of news is to signal an event, and that signalling, eventually, is a consequence of [[editorial board|editorial]] selection and judgement;  [[journalism]] creates and sows the seeds (news) that establish [[public opinion]].

==Manufacture of consent==&lt;!-- [[Manufacturing Consent (disambiguation)]] links to this section --&gt;

When properly deployed in the [[public interest]], the manufacture of [[consent]] is useful and necessary for a cohesive society, because, in many cases, "the common interests" of the public are not obvious except upon careful analysis of the collected data, a critical intellectual exercise in which most people are uninterested or are incapable of doing. Therefore, most people must have the world summarized for them by the well-informed, and will then act accordingly.

{{Quotation|
That the '''manufacture of consent''' is capable of great refinements no one, I think, denies. The process by which public opinions arise is certainly no less intricate than it has appeared in these pages, and the opportunities for manipulation open to anyone who understands the process are plain enough. . . . [a]s a result of psychological research, coupled with the modern means of communication, the practice of democracy has turned a corner. A revolution is taking place, infinitely more significant than any shifting of economic power.... Under the impact of propaganda, not necessarily in the sinister meaning of the word alone, the old constants of our thinking have become variables. It is no longer possible, for example, to believe in the original dogma of democracy; that the knowledge needed for the management of human affairs comes up spontaneously from the human heart. Where we act on that theory we expose ourselves to self-deception, and to forms of persuasion that we cannot verify. It has been demonstrated that we cannot rely upon intuition, conscience, or the accidents of casual opinion if we are to deal with the world beyond our reach.|Walter Lippmann, ''Public Opinion'', Chapter XV}}

The political élite are members of the class of people who are incapable of accurately understanding, by themselves, the complex "unseen environment" wherein the public affairs of the modern state occur; thus, Lippmann proposes that a professional, "specialized class" collect and analyze data, and present their conclusions to the society's decision makers, who, in their turn, use the "art of persuasion" to inform the public about the decisions and circumstances affecting them.&lt;ref&gt;Chapter XV, “Leaders and the Rank and File”, section 4.&lt;/ref&gt;

''Public Opinion'' proposes that the increased power of [[propaganda]] and the specialized knowledge required for effective political decisions have rendered the traditional notion of [[democracy]] impossible. The phrase "manufacture of consent" was introduced, which the [[intellectual|public intellectuals]] [[Noam Chomsky]] and [[Edward S. Herman]] used as the title of their book ''[[Manufacturing Consent: The Political Economy of the Mass Media]]'' (1988).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5533">'''Reverse electrodialysis''' ('''RED''') is the [[salinity gradient]] energy retrieved from the difference in the salt [[concentration]] between [[seawater]] and [[Fresh water|river water]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1980OcEng...7....1L 1980 - energy by reverse electrodialysis]&lt;/ref&gt; A method of utilizing the energy produced by this process by means of a heat engine was invented by Prof. [[Sidney Loeb]] in 1977 at the Ben-Gurion University of the Negev.
[http://www.google.com/patents/US4171409 --United States Patent US4171409]

In reverse [[electrodialysis]] a salt solution and fresh water are let through a stack of alternating cation and anion exchange membranes. The chemical potential difference between salt and fresh water generates a voltage over each membrane and the total potential of the system is the sum of the potential differences over all membranes. The process works through difference in ion concentration instead of an electric field, which has implications for the type of membrane needed.&lt;ref&gt;[http://mtg.tnw.utwente.nl/teaching/assign/blue/ See note 2] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080927220919/http://mtg.tnw.utwente.nl/teaching/assign/blue/ |date=2008-09-27 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In RED, as in a [[fuel cell]], the cells are stacked. A module with a capacity of 250&amp;nbsp;kW has the size of a shipping container.

In the [[Netherlands]], for example, more than 3,300 m³ fresh water runs into the sea per second on average. The membrane halves the pressure differences which results in a water column of approximately 135&amp;nbsp;meters. The energy potential is therefore e=[[Potential energy#Gravitational potential energy|mg&amp;Delta;h]]=3.3*10&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;kg/s*10&amp;nbsp;m/s&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;*135&amp;nbsp;meters ca.= 4.5*10&lt;sup&gt;9&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;[[Joule]] per second, Power=4.5 gigawatts.
&lt;!--
These numbers do not work out correctly: see Talk. Theoretically the output is 2.5 MJ or 0.5 kWh/m³. This corresponds to about 3,000 MW, which is about one-third of the national electricity consumption ([[2005]]).

"14*3300 bars m^3/sec" yields 4.6 GW (type it into a Google search box) so the numbers work out okay.~~~

In 2006 a 50&amp;nbsp;kW plant was located at a coastal test site in [[Harlingen, Netherlands|Harlingen]], the Netherlands,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.leonardo-energy.org/drupal/book/export/html/2243 Blue energy]&lt;/ref&gt; the focus being on prevention of [[biofouling]] of the [[anode]], [[cathode]], and membranes and increasing the membrane performance.&lt;ref&gt;[http://tbk.eldoc.ub.rug.nl/FILES/root/2008/JMembrSciVeerman/2008JMembrSciVeerman.pdf electrodialysis stacks by a validated model]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.netserver2.net/waterforum/index.asp?url=/template_a1.asp&amp;que=paginanr=3716 Friese wereldprimeur met stroomproductie uit zoet-zout water]&lt;/ref&gt; In 2007 the Directorate for Public Works and Water Management, Redstack, and ENECO signed a declaration of intent for development of a pilot plant on the [[Afsluitdijk]] in the Netherlands.&lt;ref&gt;[http://corporateuk.eneco.nl/pages/default.asp?PageID=60&amp;Mainmenu=News%20and%20media&amp;MainmenuID=45&amp;Mainmenusub=Press%20releases&amp;MainmenusubID=60&amp;ShowNieuws=13424&amp;ModuleitemID=424 Electricity from fresh and salt water]&lt;/ref&gt; The plant was put into service on 26 November 2014 and produces 50 kW of electricity to show the technical feasibility in real-life conditions using fresh IJsselmeer water and salt water from the Wadden Sea. Theoretically, with 1m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;/s river water and an equal amount of sea water, approximately 1 MW of renewable electricity can be recovered at this location by upscaling the plant.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Dutch King opens world's first RED power plant driven on fresh-salt water mixing|url=http://www.dutchwatersector.com/news-events/news/12388-dutch-king-opens-world-s-first-red-power-plant-driven-on-fresh-salt-water-mixing.html|publisher=Dutch Water Sector|accessdate=4 April 2016|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160416092205/http://www.dutchwatersector.com/news-events/news/12388-dutch-king-opens-world-s-first-red-power-plant-driven-on-fresh-salt-water-mixing.html|archivedate=16 April 2016|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is to be expected that after this phase the installation could be further expanded to a final capacity of 200 MW.

'''Si6''' is the [[codename]] of the ''Laboratorio de Investigación y Desarrollo en Seguridad Informática'' (Information Security Research and Development Laboratory) of the [[Argentina|Argentine]] [[CITEFA]] (''Instituto de Investigaciones Científicas y Técnicas de las Fuerzas Armadas'', [[Military of Argentina|Armed Forces]] Scientific and Technical Research Institute).

SI6 belongs to the Information Security Division of CITEFA's Information Technology Department.

==History==
The Si6 was created on January 2004 to analyze and provide the [[Ministry of Defense (Argentina)|Argentine Ministry of Defense]] with scientific and technical assistance on subjects related to [[computer security]].
Si6 creation was somehow hard to accomplish, mainly because it's very difficult to admit new workers into Argentina's Government. Finally it was possible thanks to the support and effort a lot people made.

==Goal==
Its mission is to create and direct [[information security]] R&amp;D activities for both general purpose and national defense areas.

==Philosophy==
Si6 believes that the sum of community efforts through applied research of innovative technologies is one of the most efficient ways to achieve technology knowledge. At the same time, Si6 think that improved education, specially on those areas, is a basic pillar of the society welfare. 

All Si6 public projects are published under the [[GNU General Public License|GPL]] license. As part of this common knowledge exchange policy, CITEFA makes different agreements with public and private institutions in order to establish a national research and development network.

==Work==
SI6 is currently working on [[intruder detection]], [[intruder classification]], [[intruder identification]], [[honeypot (computing)|honeypot]]s, [[pattern analysis]], [[biometric authentication]], [[virtual private networks]], [[firewall (networking)|firewalls]], [[digital signature]], [[penetration test]]s, etc.

==Location==
Si6 is located at CITEFA headquarters, [[Buenos Aires]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3316">'''Sirtuin-activating compounds''' (STAC) are chemical compounds having an effect on [[sirtuin]]s, a group of enzymes that use NAD+ to remove acetyl groups from proteins. They are [[caloric restriction mimetic]] candidates, molecules able to prevent [[aging]]-related diseases like Alzheimer's,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

==Context==
[[Leonard P. Guarente]] is recognized as the leading proponent of the hypothesis that caloric restriction slows aging by activation of Sirtuins.

STACs have been discovered by [[Konrad Howitz]] of Biomol Inc and biologist [[David Sinclair (biologist)|David Sinclair]]. In September 2003, Howitz and Sinclair et al. published a highly cited paper reporting that [[polyphenol]]s such as [[resveratrol]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Kaeberlein | first1 = M. | last2 = McDonagh | first2 = T. | last3 = Heltweg | first3 = B. | last4 = Hixon | first4 = J. | last5 = Westman | first5 = E.

Other examples of such products are [[butein]], [[piceatannol]], [[isoliquiritigenin]], [[fisetin]], and [[quercetin]].

Some STACs can cause artificial effects in the assay initially used for their identification, but it has been shown that STACs also activate SIRT1 against regular polypeptide substrates, with an influence of the substrate sequence.&lt;ref name=PMID23524286&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Lakshminarasimhan|first1=M|last2=Rauh|first2=D|last3=Schutkowski|first3=M|last4=Steegborn|first4=C|title=Sirt1 activation by resveratrol is substrate sequence-selective|journal=Aging|volume=5|pages=151–4|pmid=23524286|issue=3|date=Mar 2013|doi=10.18632/aging.100542|pmc=3629287}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=PMID23471411&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hubbard|first1=BP|title=Evidence for a common mechanism of SIRT1 regulation by allosteric activators|journal=Science|volume=339|pages=1216–9|pmid=23471411|doi=10.1126/science.1231097|issue=6124|date=Mar 2013|display-authors=etal|pmc=3799917}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Ptolemaeus - Quadripartitum, 1622 - 4658973.tif|thumb|''Quadripartitum'', 1622]]
'''''Tetrabiblos''''' ({{lang|grc|Τετράβιβλος}}) 'four books', also known in [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] as  '''''Apotelesmatiká''''' ({{lang|grc|Ἀποτελεσματικά}}) "Effects", and in [[Latin]] as '''''Quadripartitum''''' "Four Parts", is a text on the philosophy and practice of [[astrology]], written in the 2nd century AD by the [[Alexandria]]n scholar [[Ptolemy|Claudius Ptolemy]] ({{circa}} AD 90–{{circa}} AD 168).

Ptolemy's ''[[Almagest]]'' was an authoritative text on [[astronomy]] for more than a thousand years, and the ''Tetrabiblos'', its companion volume, was equally influential in [[astrology]], the study of the effects of astronomical cycles on earthly matters.  But whilst the ''Almagest'' as an astronomical authority was superseded by acceptance of the [[heliocentric model]] of the [[solar system]], the ''Tetrabiblos'' remains an important theoretical work for astrology.

Besides outlining the techniques of astrological practice, Ptolemy's philosophical defense of the subject as a natural, beneficial study helped secure theological tolerance towards astrology in [[Western Europe]] during the [[Medieval era]]. This allowed Ptolemaic teachings on astrology to be included in universities during the [[Renaissance]], which brought an associated impact upon medical studies and literary works.
 
The historical importance of the ''Tetrabiblos'' is seen by the many ancient, Medieval and Renaissance commentaries that have been published about it. It was copied, commented on, paraphrased, abridged, and translated into many languages. The latest critical Greek edition, by Wolfgang Hübner, was published by [[Teubner]] in 1998.

Analogies between the status of the ''Tetrabiblos'' in astrology and the Bible in Christianity are frequent. See for example [[#Reference-Riley|Riley (1974)]] p.235, "virtually the Bible of astrology"; Broughton, ''Elements of Astrology'' (1898) p.7: "Ptolemy’s Four Books on Astrology are to the European and American Student what the Bible is to the student of Christian Theology";  Tucker, ''Principles of Scientific Astrology'' (1938) p.32: "it is the ''Tetrabiblos'' which interests astrologers ... it is their astrological bible"; and Zusne, Jones, ''Anomalistic psychology: a study of magical thinking'' (1989) p.201: "the astrologer's bible, the Tetrabiblos, is still in use in the Western world".&lt;/ref&gt;  Compiled in [[Alexandria]] in the 2nd century, the work gathered commentaries about it from its first publication.&lt;ref name="tester57" /&gt; It was translated into [[Arabic]] in the 9th century, and is described as "by far the most influential source of medieval Islamic astrology".&lt;ref&gt;[[#Reference-Saliba|Saliba (1997)]]  [https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=mOquCzBX3xcC&amp;lpg=PA67&amp;dq=Tetrabiblos%20Arabs&amp;pg=PA67#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false p.67].&lt;/ref&gt;

With the translation of the ''Tetrabiblos'' into Latin in the 12th century, "Ptolemaic astrology" became integrated by [[Albertus Magnus]] and [[Thomas Aquinas]] into medieval [[Christianity|Christian]] doctrine.&lt;ref name="Tarnas"&gt;[[#Reference-Tarnas|Tarnas (1991)]]  [https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=-YIIRXtokSsC&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;pg=PA193#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false pp.193–194].&lt;/ref&gt; This [[Theology|theological]] acceptance encouraged the teaching of Ptolemaic astrology in universities, often linked to medical studies. This, in turn, brought attention in literary works, such as [[Dante]]'s, which helped shape the [[Morality|moral]], religious and [[Cosmos|cosmological]] [[Paradigm shift#Science and paradigm shift|paradigm]] of [[Western Europe]] during the [[Medieval era]].&lt;ref name="Tarnas" /&gt;  The ''Tetrabiblos'' was largely responsible for laying down  the basic precepts of [[Renaissance]] astrology,&lt;ref&gt;[[#Reference-Webster|Webster (1979)]]  [https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=g588AAAAIAAJ&amp;lpg=PA276&amp;dq=Ptolemy%20Tetrabiblos%2016th%20century&amp;pg=PA276#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false p.276].&lt;/ref&gt; and was a necessary textbook in some of the finest universities of Renaissance and [[early modern Europe]].&lt;ref name="Rutkin" /&gt;  
[[File:Claudius ptolemaius.jpg|upright|thumb|left|16th-century woodcut depicting Ptolemy, from ''Les vrais portraits et vies des hommes illustres'', Paris, 1584, f°87.]]
Ptolemaic astrology continued to be taught at European universities into the 17th century,&lt;ref name="Rutkin" /&gt;  but by the mid-17th century the study struggled to maintain its position as one of the respected [[Liberal sciences]].&lt;ref&gt;See [[#Reference-Ramesey|Ramesey (1654)]] bk. I 'A vindication of astrology', p.2, which presents a lengthy argument for why astrology is defined as a "Mathematical art", being neither "a distinct Art or Science by itself" but "one of the Liberal Sciences". See also [[#Reference-Thorndike|Thorndike (1958)]] vol. 12, ch.5: 'Astrology to 1650', and [[#Reference-Thomas|Thomas (1971)]] ch.3: 'Astrology: its social and intellectual role' which describes the determined efforts to preserve the intellectual standing of astrology in the mid-late 17th century, which rapidly collapsed at the end of that century.&lt;/ref&gt; At this time, the contents of the ''Tetrabiblos'' started to draw stigmatisation as part of "a diabolical art of divination". One 17th-century critic was to write of its subject: "no superstitious art is more fitted to forward the aims of the devil than the astrology of Ptolemy".{{Citation needed|date=May 2018}}

The intellectual standing of astrology collapsed rapidly at the end of the 17th century, but the historical impact of the ''Tetrabiblos'' upon world culture continues to engage the attention of scholars of [[classical philosophy]] and the [[History of science in classical antiquity|history of sciences in antiquity]].&lt;ref&gt;[[#Reference-Lehoux|Lehoux (2006)]] p.108: "Perhaps the most influential of the ancient physical accounts is that offered by Ptolemy in his ''Tetrabiblos''".&lt;/ref&gt; It also maintains its position as an influential textbook for practitioners of modern western astrology, and English translations of the text were published by [[astrologer]]s in the 18th, 19th and 20th centuries.&lt;ref&gt;For example, the Whalley translation (1701), and 'corrected edition' by Ebenezer Sibly and his brother (1786); James Wilson (1828), and other privately circulated manuscripts of the 19th century such as that produced by John Worsdale; the [[Project Hindsight]] translation by Robert Schmidt (1994).  Details of these texts and other translations are given in the section on [[Tetrabiblos#Editions and translations|Editions and translations]].&lt;/ref&gt; The early 20th-century [[Humanism|Humanist]] astrologer [[Dane Rudhyar]] reported that the astrology of his era "originated almost entirely in the work of the Alexandrian astrologer, Claudius Ptolemy".&lt;ref&gt;[[#Reference-Rudhyar|Rudhyar (1936)]] [https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=dApyUYhq4-4C&amp;lpg=PR2&amp;dq=Rudhyar%20astrology%20of%20personality&amp;pg=PA4#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false p.4].&lt;/ref&gt; Even 21st-century astrological textbooks have described the ''Tetrabiblos'' as being "without a doubt, indispensable for any serious student of astrology".&lt;ref&gt;[[#Reference-Avelar-2010|Avelar and Ribeiro (2010)]] 'Annotated Bibliography' p.275: "This is an astrological classic and probably the most widely cited in the history of the art. It is one of the most important and influential works in the field of astrology ... without a doubt, indispensable for any serious student of astrology".&lt;/ref&gt;

The work's enduring significance is attributed to several factors: Ptolemy's reputation as one of the greatest philosophers and scientists of the ancient world,&lt;ref&gt;[[#Reference-Ashmand|Ashmand (1822)]] 'Translator's Introduction'.&lt;/ref&gt; the text's astrological importance as one of the oldest complete manuals on that subject,&lt;ref name="Houlding"&gt;[[#Reference-Houlding-1993|Houlding (1993)]] p.3.&lt;/ref&gt; and the unprecedented order and quality of Ptolemy's astrological explanations.&lt;ref name="Riley"&gt;[[#Reference-Riley88|Riley (1988)]]  p.69.&lt;/ref&gt;

The "outstanding mark of Ptolemy’s astrology" is described as "informed by the philosophical and scientific spirit of his age".&lt;ref name="tester60"&gt;[[#Reference-Tester-1987|Tester (1987)]]  [https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=L0HSvH96alIC&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;dq=Tester%20Astrology&amp;pg=PA60#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false p.60].&lt;/ref&gt; Ptolemy wrote at a time when "physics" was defined by [[philosophy]], and his account of stellar effects was expressed in terms of the four Aristotelian qualities (hot, cold, wet, and dry) set against the philosophical notion of [[Macrocosm and microcosm|universal unity]] and [[Musica universalis|cosmic harmony]].&lt;ref&gt;[[#Reference-Tester-1987|Tester (1987)]]  [https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=L0HSvH96alIC&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;dq=Tester%20Astrology&amp;pg=PA59#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false p.59]; [[#Reference-Lehoux|Lehoux (2006)]] pp.107-109.&lt;/ref&gt; His objective was to explain the rationale of astrology in such terms, so the work is also notable for its dismissal of astrological practices which lack a direct astronomical basis:&lt;ref&gt;[[#Reference-Tester-1987|Tester (1987)]]  [https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=L0HSvH96alIC&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;dq=Tester%20Astrology&amp;pg=PA64#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false p.64].&lt;/ref&gt;

The book opens with an explanation of the philosophical framework of astrology which aims to answer the arguments of critics who questioned the subject's  validity.&lt;ref name="Houlding" /&gt;  Of this, [[Lynn Thorndike]], in his ''History of Magic and Experimental Science'', writes: "Only the opponents of astrology appear to have remained ignorant of the ''Tetrabiblos'', continuing to make criticisms of the art which do not apply to Ptolemy's presentation of it or which had been specifically answered by him".&lt;ref&gt;[[#Reference-Thorndike|Thorndike (1958)]] vol. 1, p.116.&lt;/ref&gt;

Ptolemy was not responsible for originating the astrological techniques he presented in the ''Tetrabiblos''.&lt;ref name="tester60" /&gt;  His contribution was to arrange the material systematically, in order to demonstrate that astrology is based upon logical, hierarchical principles.&lt;ref name="Houlding" /&gt;  Astrological influences are frequently referred to the meteorological effects of humoral shifts, which were presumed to result from celestial cycles bringing correlated changes in the heating, cooling, moistening, and drying affects of the atmosphere.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Reference-Avelar-2010|Avelar and Ribeiro (2010)]] ch.2, pp.10–17. See for example[[#Reference-Robbins_Tet|''Tetrabiblos'']] [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Ptolemy/Tetrabiblos/1B*.html#4 I.4]: 'Of the Power of the Planets'.&lt;/ref&gt;

The historical importance and influence of the ''Tetrabiblos'' is attested by the many ancient, Medieval and Renaissance commentaries  published about it, as well as the many translations and paraphrased editions that aim to reproduce its content in an accessible manner.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Reference-Robbins_Tet|Robbins (1940)]] 'Translator's Introduction', [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Ptolemy/Tetrabiblos/Introduction*.html III, pp.xvi–xvii.]&lt;/ref&gt; The Greek text has undergone transmission into Arabic, Latin and many modern languages. The first English translation did not appear until the 18th century, but by the end of the 19th century the American astrologer Luke Broughton reported he had at least half a dozen different English translations in his possession.&lt;ref&gt;''Elements of Astrology'' (1898) [https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=67WarAlhu-YC&amp;q=Tetrabiblos#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false p.7]. Broughton describes its value to astrologers as "One of the best books the student should read, and which is most essential" p.v.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Title and date of composition==
[[File:Ptolemy tetrabiblos 1.jpg|thumb|Opening chapter of the first printed edition of Ptolemy's ''Tetrabiblos'', transcribed into Greek and Latin by [[Joachim Camerarius]] (Nuremberg, 1535).]]
The commonly known Greek and Latin titles  (''Tetrabiblos'' and ''Quadripartitum'' respectively), meaning 'four books', are  traditional nicknames&lt;ref name="J1"&gt;[[#Reference-Jones-2010|Jones (2010)]] 'Introduction' by Alexander Jones, p.xii: "The ''Tetrabiblos'' (again a nickname - we do not know Ptolemy's own title, but a credible guess is ''Apotelesmatika'', roughly 'Astrological Influences')".&lt;/ref&gt; for a work which in some Greek manuscripts is entitled {{lang|grc|Μαθηματικὴ τετράβιβλος σύνταξις}}, 'Mathematical treatise in four books'.&lt;ref name="R1"&gt;[[#Reference-Robbins_Tet|Robbins (1940)]] 'Translator's Introduction' [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Ptolemy/Tetrabiblos/Introduction*.html II, p.x–xi].&lt;/ref&gt; Frank Eggleston Robbins, editor of the [[Loeb]] English translation published in 1940, considered it likely that this was the title used by Ptolemy himself, although he acknowledged that many other Greek manuscripts use the title {{lang|grc|Τὰ πρὸς Σύρον ἀποτελεσματικά}}, 'The prognostics addressed to Syrus'.&lt;ref name="R1" /&gt; An ancient anonymous commentary on the work states that some considered the term ''Tetrabiblos'' to be a fictitious name.&lt;ref name="R1" /&gt;

Hübner, editor of the 1998 Teubner Greek edition, uses the title ''Apotelesmatiká'' (''biblía''), '(books on) effects', which has been followed by recent scholars.&lt;ref name="H1"&gt;Heilen, Stephan, 'Ptolemy's Doctrine of the Terms and its Reception', in [[#Reference-Jones-2010|Jones (2010)]] [https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=Y61qolT7m98C&amp;lpg=PA82&amp;dq=Jones%2C%20Alexander%20(ed.)%202010.%20Ptolemy%20in%20Perspective%3A%20Use%20and%20Criticism%20of%20his%20Work%20from%20Antiquity%20to%20the%20Nineteenth%20Century&amp;pg=PA45#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false p.45].&lt;/ref&gt; Alexander Jones, editor of the Springer publication ''Ptolemy in Perspective'' (2010) considers that Ptolemy's own title remains unknown, but agrees that the term  ''Apotelesmatika''  is "a credible guess".&lt;ref name="J1" /&gt; This term is variously translated to mean 'influences',&lt;ref name="J1" /&gt; 'effects'&lt;ref name="H1" /&gt; or 'prognostics';&lt;ref name="R1" /&gt; reflecting the theme of work, which is concerned with gaining foreknowledge of the effects of predictable astronomical cycles.

There is no firmly established date for the compilation of the ''Tetrabiblos''  but Ptolemy discloses in his 'Introductory Address' that he wrote his astrological treatise after completing his astronomical one: the ''[[Almagest]]''.&lt;ref name="IA"&gt;[[#Reference-Robbins_Tet|''Tetrabiblos'']] I.1 (Loeb:  [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Ptolemy/Tetrabiblos/1A*.html#1 p.3]).&lt;/ref&gt;   Evidence within the ''Almagest'' reveals that the astronomical work could not have been completed before about 145 AD,&lt;ref&gt;N. T. Hamilton and N. M. Swerdlow, 'From Ancient Omens to Statistical Mechanics', in [[#Reference-BG|Berggren and Goldstein (1987)]], argue 150 A.D. (p.3–13); [[#Reference-Grasshoff|Grasshoff (1990)]] argues that the observations in the ''Almagest'' cover the period between 127–141 A.D. (p.7).&lt;/ref&gt;  which demonstrates that Ptolemy wrote the ''Tetrabiblos'' towards the end of his life, sometime between completing the ''Almagest'' and his death, generally reported to be around 168 A.D.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Reference-Pecker|Pecker (2001)]] [https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=zGOVnMa-LSIC&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;dq=Pecker%2C%20Jean%20Claude%2C%202001.%20Understanding%20the%20Heavens%3A%20Thirty%20Centuries%20of%20Astronomical%20Ideas%20from%20Ancient%20Thinking%20to%20Modern%20Cosmology.&amp;pg=PA311#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false p.311]. Most contemporary sources give c. 90 – c. 168 as the most likely time-span of Ptolemy's life. [[#Reference-Robbins_Tet|Robbins]] gives 100–178 ('Introduction', [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Ptolemy/Tetrabiblos/Introduction*.html I p.viii]). [[#Reference-Smith-1996|Mark Smith]] also veers towards the figures given by Robbins: "It is said that he lived to be seventy-eight and survived into the reign of Antonius Pius' successor, Mark Aurelius (161–180). These two claims, if true, would lead us to place Ptolemy's death not only somewhere within that span, but probably toward the end".&lt;/ref&gt;

The text begins with Ptolemy's address to "Syrus", an unidentified character to whom all Ptolemy's works are dedicated.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Reference-Ashmand|Ashmand (1822)]] 'Preface' [https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=hmCA5zjTr_cC&amp;lpg=PR23&amp;dq=Ptolemy%20syrus&amp;pg=PR24#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false  p.xxiv, footnote 4].&lt;/ref&gt;   In this Ptolemy differentiates between two types of astronomical study: the first ([[astronomy]] proper) which discovers the astronomical cycles and movements; the second ([[astrology]]) which investigates the changes these movements bring about. He states that each has its own science and  the former is desirable in its own right "even though it does not attain the result given by its combination with the second".&lt;ref name="IA" /&gt; This is taken to demonstrate Ptolemy's view that astronomy and astrology are complementary studies, so that whilst astrology is less self-sufficient and factual,&lt;ref name="tester57" /&gt; its employment makes the practice of astronomy more useful.&lt;ref name="Lx1"&gt;[[#Reference-Lehoux|Lehoux (2006)]] footnote 28: "Older versions of the history of astronomy tended to make great hay of Ptolemy's separating his astronomy and astrology into two books (the ''Almagest'' and the ''Tetrabiblos''), as though that pointed to doubts Ptolemy had about astrology as a body of knowledge. But Ptolemy is clear that even if it is ''less certain'', astrology is ''more useful'' than astronomy".&lt;/ref&gt; Although the terms ''astronomia'' and ''astrologia'' were used interchangeably in ancient texts,&lt;ref&gt;[[#Reference-Evans-Berggren-2006|Evans and Berggren (2006)]]  [https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=HPBE3RbeceQC&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;dq=Geminos&amp;pg=PA128#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false p.127])&lt;/ref&gt; this also demonstrates the early definition of two differentiated subjects which were discussed at length by Ptolemy in two separate works.&lt;ref name="Lx1" /&gt;

Ptolemy states that having dealt with the former subject (astronomy) in its own treatise, he "shall now give an account of the second and less self-sufficient method in a properly philosophical way, so that one whose aim is the truth might never compare its perceptions with the sureness of the first".&lt;ref name="IA" /&gt; In this, and further introductory remarks, he reveals his view that  astrological prediction is extremely difficult and easily subject to error, but satisfactorily attainable to those who possess the necessary skill and experience, and of too much benefit to be dismissed simply because it can sometimes be mistaken.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Reference-Robbins_Tet|''Tetrabiblos'']] I.2 (Loeb: [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Ptolemy/Tetrabiblos/1A*.html#2 p.19]): "...it would not be fitting to dismiss all prognostication of this character because it can sometimes be mistaken, for we do not discredit the art of the pilot for its many errors; but as when the claims are great, so also when they are divine, we should welcome what is possible and think it enough".&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Ptolemy's philosophical arguments ====
Chapters 2 and 3 are important for giving Ptolemy's philosophical defense of his subject. [[Franz Boll (philologist)|Franz Boll]] noticed the arguments were paralleled in older sources, particularly  those of the [[Stoicism|Stoic]] philosopher [[Posidonius]] ({{circa}}135 BCE–{{circa}}AD 51 BCE).&lt;ref&gt;[[#Reference-North|North (1989)]] p.248. Discussed by Boll in ''Studien uber Claudius Ptolemaus'' (Leipzig, 1894) pp.131ff.&lt;/ref&gt; Equally, Ptolemy's narrative was drawn  upon by later [[philosophers]] and [[astronomers]], such as [[Johannes Kepler]] who used similar examples and the same order of arguments to explain the  physical foundation of some astrological claims.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Reference-Jensen|Jensen (2006)]] p.118. Ptolemy's arguments were used by Kepler in his 1602 text, ''De Fundamentalis Astrologiae''.&lt;/ref&gt;   Described as  "scientifically speaking, perfectly laudable" by one modern commentator,&lt;ref&gt;[[#Reference-North|North (1989)]] p.248&lt;/ref&gt; another has condemned these chapters  as the place where Ptolemy's "knowledge, intelligence and rhetorical skill" are most "misused".&lt;ref&gt;[[#Reference-Long|Long (1982)]] p.178.&lt;/ref&gt;

In chapter one Ptolemy asserts the legitimacy of the study and identifies the two main arguments set against it: 
# the complexity of the subject makes its claim of providing reliable foreknowledge unattainable;
# reliable foreknowledge—if it can be attained—would imply such [[fatalism]] as to make the subject's purpose useless (since if the future is predictable, anything which is destined to happen will happen whether predicted or not).
Ptolemy then answers each criticism in the following two chapters.

;Argument on the extent of astrology's reliability
In chapter two Ptolemy maintains that knowledge gained by astronomical means is attainable and he attempts to define its limits according to "Aristotelian-Stoic" logic.&lt;ref name="tester64"&gt;[[#Reference-Tester-1987|Tester (1987)]]  [https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=L0HSvH96alIC&amp;pg=PA64#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false p.64].&lt;/ref&gt;  He points out how the [[Sun]] has the greatest influence upon the Earth’s seasonal and daily cycles, and that most things in nature are synchronised by the [[Moon]]:
{{quote|... as the heavenly body nearest the Earth, the Moon bestows her effluence  most abundantly upon mundane things, for most of them, animate or inanimate, are sympathetic to her and change in company with her; the rivers increase and diminish their streams with her light, the seas turn their own tides with her rising and setting, and plants and animals in whole or in some part wax and wane with her.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Reference-Robbins_Tet|''Tetrabiblos'']] I.2 (Loeb: [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Ptolemy/Tetrabiblos/1A*.html#1 p.7]).&lt;/ref&gt;}}
He extends this ability to stir the weather and steer the biological patterns of earthly creatures to  the [[stars in astrology|fixed stars]] and [[Classical planet|planets]], so that everything which experiences cycles of growth, or patterns of behaviour, is in some way responsive to the celestial cycles. These bring about elemental changes (hot, windy, snowy or watery conditions, ''etc''): led by the Sun, activated by the Moon and aided by the planetary [[astrological aspect|configurations]] and the fixed stars' [[phenomena]]. The prevailing [[meteorological]] qualities are then considered to   determine the [[temperament]] – the quality of the moment of time at a specific place - which is  presumed to be impressed, as a sort of temporal imprint, upon the seed of anything which comes into germination or manifestation at that moment in time. Ptolemy admits that successful analysis of this temperament is not easily attained but is capable of being determined by someone who is able to regard the data “both scientifically and by successful conjecture”. He questions why, if a person can reliably predict the general weather patterns and their effects upon agricultural seeds and animals from the knowledge of the celestial cycles: 
{{quote|... can he not, too, with respect to an individual man, perceive the general quality of his temperament from the ambient&lt;ref&gt;The term "ambient" refers to the humoural state of the surrounding air; ''i.e.,'' the 'enveloping environment' (''Ambient'': "relating to the immediate surroundings of something" [http://oxforddictionaries.com/definition/ambient Oxford English Dictionary]. Retrieved 4 September 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; at the time of his birth, … and predict occasional events, by the fact that such and such an ambient is attuned to such and such a temperament and is favourable to prosperity, while another is not so attuned and conduces to injury?&lt;ref&gt;[[#Reference-Robbins_Tet|''Tetrabiblos'']] I.2 (Loeb: [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Ptolemy/Tetrabiblos/1A*.html#1 p.13]).&lt;/ref&gt;}}
Whilst suggesting that such arguments are enough to demonstrate the validity of astrology, Ptolemy accepts that many mistakes are made in its practice - partly because of  "evident rascals" who profess to practice it without due knowledge and pretend to foretell things which cannot be naturally known (sometimes using the term 'astrology' for practices which are not true to the genuine study of astrology)&lt;ref&gt;[[#Reference-Robbins_Tet|''Tetrabiblos'']] I.2 (Loeb: [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Ptolemy/Tetrabiblos/1A*.html#1 p.13]), ''i.e''., those who "for the sake of gain, claim credence for another art under the name of this, and deceive the vulgar". In his commentary on the ''Tetrabiblos'' [[Jerome Cardan]] gave the example of those who give elaborate predictions based only on the day or month of birth.&lt;/ref&gt; and because legitimate practitioners must acquire a magnitude of knowledge and experience within a limited life-span. His summary is that the study is usually only able to give reliable knowledge in general terms; that astrological advice should be welcomed but not expected to be faultless; and that the astrologer should not be criticised but encouraged to integrate non-celestial information within the compilation of a judgement (such as what is known of an individual’s ethnic background, nationality and parental influences).&lt;ref&gt;[[#Reference-Robbins_Tet|''Tetrabiblos'']] I.2 (Loeb: [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Ptolemy/Tetrabiblos/1A*.html#1 p.19]): "We should not object to astrologers using as a basis for calculation nationality, country, and rearing, or any other existing accidental qualities". Most of book II is given to exploring the stereotypes of nations in astrological terms.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
[[File:Unibibliotek Salzburg Artes liberales Astronomia.jpg|thumb|left|15th-century manuscript illustration of astronomy as one of the [[seven liberal arts]], showing Ptolemy as its patron.]]

;Argument on whether astrology is natural and useful

In chapter three Ptolemy argues that astrological prediction is both natural and beneficial. The translation of these ideas into Latin in the 12th century are described as being "of critical importance" to the adoption of a favourable attitude towards astrology within [[Christianity]] in the [[Medieval period]].&lt;ref&gt;[[#Reference-Lindberg|Lindberg (2007)]] [https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=dPUBAkIm2lUC&amp;lpg=PA274&amp;dq=Tetrabiblos%20ending&amp;pg=PA274#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false p.247ff].&lt;/ref&gt;
  
Ptolemy first proposes that it is not "useless" to create predictions of what is likely to happen, even if the predictions do not provide the means to avoid impending disaster. This was one of the well known classical criticisms that had been brought to prominence in [[Cicero]]'s text ''[[De Divinatione]]'', in the argument that no good comes from warnings of imminent disasters when they  offer no means of escape.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Reference-Cicero|Cicero (c. 45 BC)]] [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Cicero/de_Divinatione/2*.html II.25,54, p.433]: "why do they warn us of things which we cannot avoid? Why, even a mortal, if he has a proper sense of duty, does not warn his friends of imminent disasters which can in no way be escaped".&lt;/ref&gt; Ptolemy gives a more positive view of divination in his assessment of astrology as a subject "by which we gain full view of things human and divine",&lt;ref name="T21"&gt;[[#Reference-Robbins_Tet|''Tetrabiblos'']] I.3 (Loeb: [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Ptolemy/Tetrabiblos/1A*.html#1 pp.21–23]).&lt;/ref&gt; which, he argues, gives a better perception of "what is fitting and expedient for the capabilities of each temperament".&lt;ref name="T21" /&gt; He views astrology as a subject which encourages enhanced self-knowledge, to be valued as a source of pleasure and well-being; since even if astrology cannot aid in the acquisition of riches or fame; the same can be said of all philosophy, which concerns itself with "greater advantages". Hence, in the case of unfortunate events that will necessarily take place, Ptolemy asserts that astrological prediction still brings benefits, because "foreknowledge accustoms and calms the soul by experience of distant events as though they were present, and prepares it to greet with calm and steadiness whatever comes".&lt;ref name="T21" /&gt;

Ptolemy's next argument was to avoid the criticisms that arise when the practice of prediction is seen to suggest [[fatalism|fatal necessity]].  This point was crucial to later theological acceptance, since [[Medieval]] religious doctrine dictates that the individual [[soul]] must possess [[free will]], in order to be responsible for its own choices and the consequences that flow from them. Gerard of Feltre's 13th-century text ''Summa on the Stars'' demonstrates the problem that astrological determinism creates for the theological argument: "If the stars make a man a murderer or a thief, then all the more it is the first cause, God, who does this, which it is shameful to suggest".&lt;ref&gt;[[#Reference- kieck|Kieckhefer (2000)]] [https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=Iw6ipCq-pZsC&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;dq=Richard%20Kieckhefer%2C%20Magic%20in%20the%20Middle%20Ages%20(Cambridge%3A%20Cambridge%20University%20Press%2C%202000&amp;pg=PA128#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false p.128].&lt;/ref&gt;  Ptolemy's comments counter the criticism by proposing that whilst the celestial cycles are entirely reliable and "eternally performed in accordance with divine, unchangeable destiny",&lt;ref name="T21" /&gt;  all earthly things are also subject to "a natural and mutable fate, and in drawing its first causes from above it is governed by chance and natural sequence".&lt;ref name="T21" /&gt;  He therefore declares that nothing is irrevocably ordained, and we are not to imagine that "events attend mankind as the result of the heavenly cause as if … destined to take place by necessity without the possibility of any other cause whatever interfering".&lt;ref name="T21" /&gt;

In this discussion Ptolemy makes a point that was to be called upon by many later astrological writers, that "the lesser cause always yields to the stronger".&lt;ref name="T25"&gt;[[#Reference-Robbins_Tet|''Tetrabiblos'']] I.3 (Loeb: [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Ptolemy/Tetrabiblos/1A*.html#1 pp.25–29]).&lt;/ref&gt;  He sees an individual as unable to resist the greater cycles of change which happen to the wider community, so even a man whose horoscope indicates gain may perish at a time that his community is struck by natural disaster or pestilence. However, Ptolemy also maintains that disastrous events will only follow a natural course if no counter action is taken to avert the problem, as when "future happenings to men are not known, or if they are known and the remedies are not applied".&lt;ref name="T25" /&gt;  He takes a balanced position in the argument of fate versus free will in writing that certain things, because their effective causes are numerous, become inevitable, whilst others are able to be averted by the act of astrological prediction. The astrologer's position is compared to that of the physician, who must be able to recognise beforehand which ailments are always fatal, and which admit of aid.&lt;ref name="T25" /&gt;

It is therefore reasonable, in Ptolemy's estimation, to moderate actions with awareness of how the prevailing and future temperament prospers or injures the natal temperament, or to elect to act at a time that is astrologically suitable to the activity – just as it is deemed rational to use knowledge of the stars to ensure safety at sea; to use knowledge of the lunar cycle to ensure successful breeding and sowing, or to cool ourselves against the extremes of temperature in order that we suffer less.

Ptolemy's philosophical conclusion on the subject, which helped to secure its intellectual standing until the 18th century, is thus: "even if it be not entirely infallible, at least its possibilities have appeared worthy of the highest regard".&lt;ref name="T25" /&gt; Having justified his intellectual involvement in the study, according to the philosophical principles of his day, Ptolemy then turns his attention to the practical theory of astrology, and the rationale that lies behind the arrangement of its principles.

=== Introduction of principles ===
[[File:Bartolomeu Velho 1568.jpg|thumb|right|300px|'''Figure of the heavenly bodies''' — An illustration of the [[Geocentric model#Ptolemaic system|Ptolemaic geocentric system]] by Portuguese cosmographer and cartographer [[Bartolomeu Velho]], 1568 (Bibliothèque Nationale, Paris).]]
One of the unique features of the ''Tetrabiblos'', amongst the astrological texts of its period, is the extent to which the first book not only introduces the basic astrological principles, but synthesises and explains the reasoning behind their reported associations in line with [[Aristotelianism|Aristotelian philosophy]].&lt;ref name="riley255"&gt;[[#Reference-Riley|Riley (1974)]] p.255.&lt;/ref&gt; Chapter four, for example, explains the "power of the planets" through their associations with the creative humoral qualities of warmth or moisture, or the reductive qualities of cold and dryness.&lt;ref name="tester59"&gt;[[#Reference-Tester-1987|Tester (1987)]]  [https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=L0HSvH96alIC&amp;lpg=PA57&amp;dq=Tester%20Ptolemy&amp;pg=PA59#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false p.59].&lt;/ref&gt; Hence Mars is described as a destructive planet because its humoral association is excessive dryness, whilst Jupiter is defined as temperate and fertilising because its association is moderate warmth and humidity.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Reference-Robbins_Tet|''Tetrabiblos'']] I.4  (Loeb: [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Ptolemy/Tetrabiblos/1B*.html#4 p.37]). See also [[#Reference-Riley88|Riley (1988)]]  p.69.&lt;/ref&gt;  These associations are based on the arrangements of the planets with regard to the Sun, as perceived from the  [[Geocentric model|geocentric perspective]], by which their orbits are measured is if they are centred upon the Earth.

Uniting these Aristotelian principles with a prevalent Greek philosophy employed by [[Zeno of Citium]] and the [[Pythagoreanism|Pythagorean]]s, the next three chapters arrange the planets into pairs of opposites.&lt;ref name="tester59" /&gt;   They may be [[Benefic planet|benefic]] (moderately warming or moistening) or [[Malefic planet|malefic]] (excessively cooling or drying); masculine (drying) or feminine (moistening); active and [[astrology of sect|diurnal]] (suited to the qualities of the day and aligned with the nature of the Sun) or passive and [[astrology of sect|nocturnal]]  (suited to the qualities of the night and aligned with the nature of the Moon).&lt;ref&gt;[[#Reference-Robbins_Tet|''Tetrabiblos'']] I.5–7 (Loeb:  [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Ptolemy/Tetrabiblos/1B*.html#4 pp.39–43]).&lt;/ref&gt;  Since these humoral associations derive from configurations with the Sun, chapter eight describes how they are subtly modified according to the  phase of each planet’s [[synodic cycle]] with the Sun.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Reference-Robbins_Tet|''Tetrabiblos'']] I.8 (Loeb:  [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Ptolemy/Tetrabiblos/1B*.html#4 p.45]). The first quarter of the synodic cycle brings an added emphasis on moisture; the next increases warmth; the next (in which the cycle is receding) withdraws the moisture and brings an added emphasis on dryness, and the final quarter (which closes the cycle) withdraws warmth and brings an added emphasis on coldness.&lt;/ref&gt;

Chapter nine discusses the "power of the fixed stars". Here, rather than give direct humoral associations, Ptolemy describes their "temperatures" as being like that of the planets he has already defined. Hence [[Aldebaran]] ("called the Torch") is described as having "a temperature like that of Mars", whilst other stars in the [[Hyades (star cluster)|Hyades]] are "like that of Saturn and moderately like that of Mercury".&lt;ref&gt;[[#Reference-Robbins_Tet|''Tetrabiblos'']] I.9 (Loeb: [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Ptolemy/Tetrabiblos/1B*.html#4 p.47]).&lt;/ref&gt; At the end of the chapter Ptolemy clarifies that these are not his proposals, but are drawn from   historical sources, being "the observations of the effects of the stars themselves as made by our predecessors".&lt;ref&gt;[[#Reference-Robbins_Tet|''Tetrabiblos'']] I.9 (Loeb: [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Ptolemy/Tetrabiblos/1B*.html#4 p.59]).&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Ptolemy Muller.jpg|thumb|left|'''Ptolemy instructing [[Regiomontanus]]''' under an image of the zodiac encircling the [[celestial spheres]]. Frontispiece from Ptolemy's ''Almagest'', (Venice, 1496).]]

Chapter ten returns to the humoral theme more explicitly, clarifying that the [[zodiac]] is aligned to the [[season]]s and so expressive of the shifting emphasis through moisture, warmth, dryness and cold, (as brought about by [[Spring (season)|spring]], [[summer]], [[autumn]], and [[winter]]). Similarly,  the four [[Angle (astrology)|angles of the chart]] present an humoral emphasis through association with the effects of the four cardinal [[winds]] that blow from their aligned directions.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Reference-Robbins_Tet|''Tetrabiblos'']] I.10 (Loeb: [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Ptolemy/Tetrabiblos/1B*.html#4 pp.59–65]). The [[Ascendant]] is the eastern angle, associated with the east wind ([[Apeliotes]]) which excels in dryness; the [[midheaven]] is the southern angle, associated with the south wind ([[Anemoi#Notus|Notus]]) which excels in heat; the [[Descendant (astrology)|descendant]] is the western angle, associated with the west wind ([[Anemoi#Zephyrus|Zephyrus]]) which excels in moisture; and the [[Imum Coeli]] is the northern angle, associated with the north wind ([[Anemoi#Boreas|Boreas]]) which excels in cold.&lt;/ref&gt; The remainder of book one (up to the final two chapters which concern the [[planetary phase]]s and aspectual applications), presents the rulerships, divisions, and configurations of the [[astrological signs|zodiac signs]], most of which are related to astronomical definitions, seasonal effects, physics and [[History of geometry|geometry]]. Geometrical principles are used to define the favourable or unfavourable quality of [[astrological aspect]]s, based on the angular relationship of planets and signs with [[ecliptic]] degrees.&lt;ref name="Riley" /&gt;

In Ptolemy’s era the boundaries of the zodiac signs were close to those of the visible [[constellation]]s whose names they bear, but Ptolemy demonstrates the theoretical distinction between the two frames of reference in describing the starting point of the zodiac as fixed, not to the stars, but to the mathematically calculated [[vernal equinox]].&lt;ref&gt;It is sometimes suggested that Ptolemy invented the tropical zodiac or broke conventional practice in his use of it; see for example Heilen, 'Ptolemy's Doctrine of the Terms and its Reception', [https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=Y61qolT7m98C&amp;lpg=PA52&amp;dq=Ptolemy%20Zodiac&amp;pg=PA52#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false p.52], in [[#Reference-Jones-2010|Jones (2010)]],  or  Robert and Dann,''The Astrological Revolution'', (Steiner Books, 2010) [https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=kxpQ1ARAS3QC&amp;lpg=PT280&amp;dq=Ptolemy%20Zodiac&amp;pg=PT280#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false p.234]. However, it is clear that Ptolemy was merely following convention, as demonstrated by ''Geminos's Introduction to the phenomena'', 'On the Circle of the Signs' [https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=HPBE3RbeceQC&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;dq=Geminos&amp;pg=PA113#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false ch.1], where the tropical zodiac is given detailed explanation in a text dated to the 1st century BCE, and known to be based on the accounts of older authorities ([[#Reference-Evans-Berggren-2006|Evans and Berggren (2006)]], Preface, p.xvi and Introduction, [https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=HPBE3RbeceQC&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;dq=Geminos&amp;pg=PA2#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false p.2]); and also because Ptolemy states that he is offering the methods of his older sources: "it is reasonable to reckon the beginnings of the signs also from the equinoxes and solstices, partly because the writers make this quite clear, and particularly because from our previous demonstrations we observe that their natures, powers, and familiarities take their cause from the solstitial and equinoctial starting-places, and from no other source. For if other starting-places are assumed, we shall either be compelled no longer to use the natures of the signs for prognostications or, if we use them, to be in error" (I.22, Loeb: [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Ptolemy/Tetrabiblos/1B*.html#4 p.109–111]).&lt;/ref&gt;  This determines the seasonally based [[tropical zodiac]] which takes its name from the Greek word τροπικός ''tropikos'': ‘of the turning’,&lt;ref&gt;Henry George Liddell, Robert Scott, ''A Greek-English Lexicon'': [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3Dtroph%2F A: 'τροπ-ή , ἡ, (τρέπω)] ('turn, turning'); 1.b "each of two fixed points in the solar year, ''the solstices''". Retrieved 24 November 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;  because it is set by the turn of the seasons and, being subject to [[Axial precession (astronomy)|precession]], experiences a slow and gradual revolution through the visible constellations.&lt;ref&gt;Although the rate of revolution is only 1° every 72 years, it adds up over long periods of time. Nearly 2,000 years have passed since Ptolemy wrote his ''Tetrabiblos'' so the displacement is now approximating to the distance of a whole zodiac sign. The full cycle completes over the course of 26,000 years  - see [[#Reference-Evans|Evans (1998)]] [https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=OX4qMyHyizYC&amp;lpg=PA1&amp;pg=PT405#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false p.245ff].&lt;/ref&gt;  For the same reason, the signs that mark the Sun’s summer and winter [[solstice]] points ([[Cancer (astrology)|Cancer]] and [[Capricorn (astrology)|Capricorn]]) are described as the 'tropical signs',&lt;ref&gt;Ptolemy described only Cancer and Capricorn as 'tropical' and referred to Aries and Libra (the signs of spring and autumn) as the equinoctial signs. Generally, other ancient authors referred to all four as tropical, to distinguish them from the 'solid' signs (Taurus, Leo, Scorpio and Aquarius) which indicate established seasons, and the 'bi-corporeal' signs (Gemini, Virgo, Sagittarius and Pisces), which Ptolemy says are so called because "they share, as it were, at end and beginning, the natural properties of the two states of weather" (I.11, Loeb: [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Ptolemy/Tetrabiblos/1B*.html#4 p.69]).&lt;/ref&gt; since these are the places where the Sun 'turns' its direction in [[celestial latitude]], (thereby defining the terrestrial [[circles of latitude]] known as the [[Tropic of Cancer]] and the [[Tropic of Capricorn]]).&lt;ref&gt;[[#Reference-Robbins_Tet|''Tetrabiblos'']] I.11 (Loeb: [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Ptolemy/Tetrabiblos/1B*.html#4 p.67]): "They have received their name from what takes place in them. For the Sun turns when he is at the beginning of these signs and reverses his latitudinal progress, causing summer in Cancer and winter in Capricorn".&lt;/ref&gt;

Whereas other ancient astrological writers gave their emphasis to the astrological interpretation of such definitions (for example, in describing how tropical signs are indicative of quickly changing situations),&lt;ref&gt;By comparison, [[Vettius Valens]] mentions the fact that Cancer is a tropical sign as one of 14 descriptive terms for the sign, and sets out the character traits of those "so born", which includes reference to Cancerians being "changeable" (''Anthology'', I.2).&lt;/ref&gt; Ptolemy's focus is notably different; given to the astronomical and philosophical factors that underlie the definitions rather than their astrological meaning in practice. Ptolemy explains that the definitions of the zodiac are not his own, but present "the natural characters of the zodiacal signs, as they have been handed down by tradition".&lt;ref&gt;[[#Reference-Robbins_Tet|''Tetrabiblos'']] I.11 (Loeb: [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Ptolemy/Tetrabiblos/1B*.html#4 p.65]).&lt;/ref&gt;  His approach finds elegant expression where he is demonstrating the logic of schematic arrangements (such as the philosophical principles behind the [[Domicile (astrology)|planetary rulership of signs]]),&lt;ref&gt;[[#Reference-Robbins_Tet|''Tetrabiblos'']] I.17 (Loeb: [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Ptolemy/Tetrabiblos/1B*.html#4 p.79]).&lt;/ref&gt;  but is noted to convey detachment in regard to the elements of astrology that are not so obviously plausible.&lt;ref&gt;For which reason he notes, but dismisses as illogical, the use of dodecatemoria (the 12-fold division of each zodiac-sign into segments of {{frac|2|1|2}}°). His argument is that such manufactured numerical divisions have no basis in the natural astronomical cycles.&lt;/ref&gt; This can be seen in the way that Ptolemy avoids going into detail on the facets of astrology that rely on [[mythological]], or [[symbol]]ic associations, and how he is willing to outline the reasoning behind  conflicting astrological proposals without revealing any personal preference for one scheme over another.&lt;ref&gt;For example, where he explains the three different ways by which the signs can be classified as masculine or feminine (I.12, [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Ptolemy/Tetrabiblos/1B*.html#4 pp.69–73]).&lt;/ref&gt;

Some commentators have viewed Ptolemy's comparatively dispassionate approach towards points of astrological contention as reason to suppose he was more interested in the theoretical principles than the actual practice of astrology.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Reference-Riley|Riley (1974)]] p.247: "Quite different approaches were used by the other astrological writers, who are concerned with practical matters. Dorotheus begins, not with a proof of the validity of astrology or a description of the universe, but with instructions for calculating births, the native's status, the native's parents status, his brothers, and so on".&lt;/ref&gt;  On the other hand, the objective tone that marks his style; his assertion that the subject is natural (by which he makes no demand for oaths of secrecy from its students as some contemporaries do);&lt;ref&gt;The 4th-century astrologer [[Julius Firmicus Maternus]] describes in his ''Mathesis'' (7.I.I) how oaths of silence were required by [[Orpheus]], [[Pythagoras]], [[Plato]] and [[Porphyry (philosopher)|Porphyry]]. Vettius Valens declared that his teachings should not be imparted to the ignorant or through chance encounters (''Anthology'' 293.26–29) and relates how [[Critodemus]] extracted "frightful oaths" from his students (150.16).&lt;/ref&gt; and the way he shows respectful reference to alternative views without vilifying authors whose practices might differ from his own,&lt;ref&gt;[[#Reference-Riley|Riley (1974)]] p.250: "Ptolemy, for whatever reason, shows few signs of the animosity toward fellow professionals which is so evident in ancient literary society".&lt;/ref&gt;  all helped to secure the text’s historical reputation as an intellectually superior one. [[Classics]] scholar Mark Riley raised these points in his assessment that Ptolemy approached the subject of astrology with exactly the same theoretical inclination that he applied to astronomy, [[Geography (Ptolemy)|geography]] and the other sciences on which he wrote.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Reference-Riley|Riley (1974)]] p.236.&lt;/ref&gt; This distinctive style of approach led Riley to conclude: "The respect shown to Ptolemy’s work by all later astrologers was due, not to its usefulness to the practitioner, but to his magisterial synthesis of astrology and science".&lt;ref name="riley255" /&gt;

== Book II: Mundane astrology ==
Book II presents Ptolemy's treatise on [[mundane astrology]]. This offers a comprehensive review of  [[ethnic stereotypes]], [[eclipses]], significations of [[comets]] and seasonal [[Lunar phase|lunations]], as used in the prediction of national economics, wars, epidemics, natural disasters and weather patterns. No other surviving ancient text offers a comparable account of this topic, in terms of the breadth and depth of detail offered by Ptolemy.  Although no demonstrated examples are given, he writes with authority in this branch of his subject, which suggests it was of particular interest to him. Modern commentators have remarked that Ptolemy was "consciously taking a different approach" to contrast "with the 'old', infinitely complicated methods".&lt;ref name="Riley" /&gt;

Ptolemy begins by stating he has briefly reviewed the important principles and will now develop the details of astrology in the appropriate order. His point is that astrological assessment of any 'particular' individual must rest upon prior knowledge of the 'general' temperament of their ethnic type; and that the circumstances of individual lives are subsumed, to some extent, within the fate of their community.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Reference-Robbins_Tet|''Tetrabiblos'']] II,1 (Loeb: [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Ptolemy/Tetrabiblos/2A*.html#1 p.119]): "And since weaker natures always yield to the stronger, and the particular always falls under the general, it would by all means be necessary for those who purpose an inquiry about a single individual long before to have comprehended the more general considerations".&lt;/ref&gt;

The second chapter gives a broad generalisation of how genetic differences develop between the inhabitants of the various [[climes]] (a demarcation based on latitude).  Communities that live close to the equator, for example, are described as having black skins, small statures, and thick woolly hair, as a protective response to the burning heat of that location. By contrast, communities that have settled in high northern regions are defined by their colder environment and its greater share of moisture. Their bodily forms are  paler, taller, with finer hair, and in their characteristics they are described as "somewhat cold in nature".&lt;ref name="TII2"&gt;[[#Reference-Robbins_Tet|''Tetrabiblos'']] II.2 (Loeb: [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Ptolemy/Tetrabiblos/2A*.html#1 p.123, 127]).&lt;/ref&gt; Both types are described as lacking civilisation because of the extremes of their environment, whereas communities that live in temperate regions are medium in colouring, moderate in stature and enjoy a more equable lifestyle. The several regions are similarly defined according to the mix that arises within this kind of analysis. Ptolemy explains that such considerations are only dealt with summarily, as a background consideration for what follows. He also makes clear that such traits are to be found "generally present, but not in every individual".&lt;ref name="TII2" /&gt;

[[File:Claudius Ptolemy- The World.jpg|thumb|300px|15th-century map depicting Ptolemy's description of the inhabited world, (1482, Johannes Schnitzer).]]

In chapter 3 Ptolemy unites his interests in astrology and geography, to outline the astrological associations of "our inhabited world". Maps based on Ptolemy’s ''[[Geography (Ptolemy)|Geographica]]'' show Ptolemy’s definition of the inhabited world as (roughly) extending from the equator to latitude 66°N, covering the land mass between the Atlantic Ocean and East China Sea.&lt;ref&gt;A footnote in the Robbins edition offers [[Jerome Cardan]]’s explanation that Ptolemy’s "inhabited world" was conceived "as a trapezium, narrower at the top (north) than the bottom, and bounded by arcs; this is divided into quadrants by north-south and east-west lines. The 'parts closer to the centre' are then marked off by lines joining the ends of the two latter, dividing each quadrant and producing 4 right-angled triangles at the centre". [[#Reference-Robbins_Tet|Robbins (1940)]] [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Ptolemy/Tetrabiblos/2A*.html#note8 p.129, n. 2]).&lt;/ref&gt;  Ptolemy extends the logic given in ancient Babylonian texts where the four quarters of the known world are attributed to the four [[triplicity]] arrangements of the zodiac.&lt;ref&gt;The triplicity groups connect the signs that stand 120° apart, and so create the shape of a triangle when joined by lines from degree to degree within the  360° circle of the zodiac. These groups are later known as the fire, earth, air and water signs, but Ptolemy does not refer to them this way.&lt;/ref&gt;  The attribution is based on association between the planets that govern the triplicities and the directions and winds those planets are affiliated with. For example, the 'Aries triplicity' (which includes Aries, Leo and Sagittarius) is chiefly dominated by Jupiter and assisted by Mars. Jupiter rules the north wind and Mars the west wind; therefore this triplicity governs the north-west quarter of Ptolemy’s "inhabited world": the area known as Europe.&lt;ref&gt;The north-eastern quarter (Scythia) is given to the triplicity of Gemini (including Libra and Aquarius); the south-eastern (Greater [[Asia]]) to the triplicity of Taurus (inc. Virgo and Capricorn); and the south-western ([[Ancient Libya]], which corresponds to [[Northwest Africa]]),  to the triplicity of Cancer (including Scorpio and Pisces).&lt;/ref&gt;

Again, these divisions are general, and specific rulership of each nation is modified by location and observed cultural distinctions. For example, in Europe, only those regions that lie to the north-west extremes are fully attributed to Jupiter and Mars, since those that lie towards the centre of the inhabited area incline towards the influence of opposing regions.&lt;ref name="T131"&gt;[[#Reference-Robbins_Tet|''Tetrabiblos'']] II.3 (Loeb: [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Ptolemy/Tetrabiblos/2A*.html#1 pp.131–137]).&lt;/ref&gt;  In this way, the "inhabited region" experiences a drift of astrological correspondence rather than sharp divisions within its quarters, and independent nations are variously affiliated with the signs of each triplicity and the planets that rule them. Ptolemy names Britain and Spain as two nations appropriately placed in the north-west quarter to accept the rulership of Jupiter and Mars. Such nations are described as "independent, liberty-loving, fond of arms, industrious", based on characteristics attributed to those planets. Being predominantly governed by masculine planets they are also "without passion for women and look down upon the pleasures of love".&lt;ref name="T131" /&gt;  Observed characteristics influence his categorisation of Britain as having a closer affinity with Aries and Mars (by which "for the most part its inhabitants are fiercer, more headstrong and bestial"), whilst Spain is reported to be more subject to Sagittarius and Jupiter, (from which is evidenced "their independence, simplicity and love of cleanliness").&lt;ref name="T131" /&gt;

Though Ptolemy describes his analysis as a "brief exposition",&lt;ref name="T157"&gt;[[#Reference-Robbins_Tet|''Tetrabiblos'']] II.3 (Loeb: [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Ptolemy/Tetrabiblos/2A*.html#1 pp.157–161]).&lt;/ref&gt;  the chapter builds into an extensive association between planets, zodiac signs and the national characteristics of 73 nations. It concludes with three additional assertions which act as core principles of mundane astrology:
# Each of the fixed stars has familiarity with the countries attributed to the sign of its ecliptic rising.

=== Use of eclipses ===

The remainder of the book shows how this information is used in the prediction of mundane events. Focus is given to eclipses, as the "first and most potent" cause of change,&lt;ref&gt;[[#Reference-Robbins_Tet|''Tetrabiblos'']] II.4 (Loeb:  [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Ptolemy/Tetrabiblos/2A*.html#1 p.161]).&lt;/ref&gt;   supplemented by examination of the 'stations'  of the [[superior planets]]: Saturn, Jupiter and Mars.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Reference-Robbins_Tet|''Tetrabiblos'']] II.4 (Loeb: [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Ptolemy/Tetrabiblos/2A*.html#1 p.163]). The planetary stations are where each planet's motion, according to geocentric observation, appears to halt and change direction. This leads the planet into or out of a period of [[apparent retrograde motion]].&lt;/ref&gt;  Although eclipses are deemed relevant to any nation affiliated with the zodiac signs in which they occur, Ptolemy's scrutiny is reserved for regions where they are visible, which he argues will manifest the effects most noticeably.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Reference-Robbins_Tet|''Tetrabiblos'']] II.4 (Loeb: [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Ptolemy/Tetrabiblos/2A*.html#1 p.163]).  See also II.7 (Loeb:[http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Ptolemy/Tetrabiblos/2B*.html#7  p.177]), where the extent of obscuration helps to determine the proportion of those in the region who will feel its effect.&lt;/ref&gt;  The period of obscuration determines the endurance of the effect, with each hour proportioning to years for a solar eclipse and months for a lunar eclipse.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Reference-Robbins_Tet|''Tetrabiblos'']] II.6 (Loeb: [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Ptolemy/Tetrabiblos/2B*.html#6 p.167]).&lt;/ref&gt;  The location of the eclipse with relation to the horizon is then used to judge whether the effects are most prevalent at the beginning, middle or end of the period,  with times of  intensification identified by planetary contacts to the degree of the eclipse which occur within this period.&lt;ref&gt;Effects are assumed to be most effective at the beginning of the period if the eclipse is visible near to the [[ascendant]]; in the middle of the period if it is near to the [[midheaven]], and at the end of the period if it is near to the  [[Descendant (astrology)|descendant]]. Attention is given to significant planetary conjunctions which fall upon, or make aspects to, the zodiac position in which the eclipse occurred. In this, planets that are rising into view in new synodic cycles signify the intensification of effects, whereas planets which are at the end of their synodic phases and disappearing under the glare of the Sun’s light bring abatements (II. 6 Loeb: [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Ptolemy/Tetrabiblos/2B*.html#6 p.169]).&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Ptolemy Astrology 1564.jpg|thumb|left|Depiction of Ptolemy employing a quadrant, from Giordano Ziletti's ''Principles of astrology and geography according to Ptolemy'', 1564.]]
Chapter 7 begins the examination of what type of event will manifest. This is judged by the [[Angle (astrology)|angle of the horizon]] which precedes the eclipse in the chart set for the location under scrutiny&lt;ref&gt;The four ‘angles’ of the chart show where the ecliptic cuts the eastern horizon ([[ascendant]]), the upper meridian ([[midheaven]]), the western horizon ([[Descendant (astrology)|descendant]]) and the lower meridian ([[Immum Coeli]]). For an eclipse to be visible and therefore astrologically relevant, it must occur above the horizon, either preceding or succeeding the midheaven. If it falls between the ascendant and the midheaven, then the relevant preceding angle is the ascendant. If it falls between the midheaven and the descendant, then the relevant preceding angle is the midheaven.&lt;/ref&gt;   and the planet(s) that dominate this angle by rulership and powerful aspectual connections.&lt;ref&gt;A procedure is outlined to establish the most significant planet. Preference is given to the planet which holds dominance over the eclipse degree but if the planet that governs the preceding angle is also powerful, preference is given to whichever is closest to one of the angles of the chart. If it is impossible to distinguish between them, both are used as partners in the signification of effect.&lt;/ref&gt;  Whether the predicted effect is beneficial or destructive depends on the condition of these planets, whilst the type of manifestation is judged by the zodiac signs, fixed stars&lt;ref&gt;[[#Reference-Robbins_Tet|''Tetrabiblos'']] II.8 (Loeb: [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Ptolemy/Tetrabiblos/2B*.html#8 pp.177–179]). Particular attention is given to the star that rises on the ascendant or culminates on the midheaven, whichever of these is the relevant preceding angle. (II.7 Loeb: [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Ptolemy/Tetrabiblos/2B*.html#7 p.171]).&lt;/ref&gt; and constellations involved.&lt;ref&gt;As an example of how this might be applied, an eclipse dominated by the 'beneficial planet' Jupiter, in good condition, would suggest prosperity and good meteorological conditions, whereas a planet considered to be destructive, such as Saturn, would suggest scarcity, freezing weather and floods  (II.8 Loeb:[http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Ptolemy/Tetrabiblos/2B*.html#8 pp.181–183]). If the event involves the tropical signs of the zodiac, the effects could be related to politics, whereas fixed signs indicate foundations and constructions of buildings, whilst common signs indicate men and kings.  If the animal signs are involved, the effects relate to herds or oxen, but if the sign or constellation presents the form of water or fish, the influence connects to the sea, fleets and floods. Of the 'terrestrial' signs (those depicted by humans or animals that live on land), the [[Northern and southern signs|northern signs]] anticipate problems such as earthquakes that arise from the land, whilst the [[Northern and southern signs|southern signs]] bring unexpected rains (II.7 Loeb:[http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Ptolemy/Tetrabiblos/2B*.html#7 pp.171–175]).&lt;/ref&gt;  The resulting prediction is of relevance to nations, but Ptolemy points out that certain individuals are more resonant to the effects than others; namely those have the Sun or Moon in their horoscopes in the same degree as the eclipse, or the degree that directly opposes it.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Reference-Robbins_Tet|''Tetrabiblos'']]  II.8 (Loeb: [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Ptolemy/Tetrabiblos/2B*.html#8 p.191]).&lt;/ref&gt;

Within his  ''Almagest'' Ptolemy explains that he had access to eclipse records kept for 900 years since the beginning of the reign of king [[Nabonassar]] (747 BC).&lt;ref&gt;Ptolemy, [[#Reference-Almagest|''Almagest'' (2nd century)]] III.7.&lt;/ref&gt;  In chapter 9 of the ''Tetrabiblos'' he shows knowledge of the Babylonian lore that accompanied these records in detailing the omens based on visual phenomena.  The colours of eclipses and "the formations that occur near them, such as rods, halos, and the like" are considered&lt;ref&gt;[[#Reference-Robbins_Tet|''Tetrabiblos'']] II.9 (Loeb: [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Ptolemy/Tetrabiblos/2B*.html#9 p.193]): "For if they appear black or livid they signify the effects which were mentioned in connection with Saturn's nature; if white, those of Jupiter; if reddish, those of Mars; if yellow, those of Venus; and if variegated, those of Mercury. If the characteristic colour appears to cover the whole body of the luminary or the whole region surrounding it, the predicted event will affect most of the parts of the countries; but if it is in any one part, it will affect only that part against which the phenomenon is inclined".&lt;/ref&gt; along with the astrological significance of comets, in whether they take the form of "'beams', 'trumpets', 'jars', and the like".  Meaning is derived from their position relative to the Sun and assessment of "the parts of the zodiac in which their heads appear and through the directions in which the shapes of their tails point".&lt;ref&gt;[[#Reference-Robbins_Tet|''Tetrabiblos'']] II.9 (Loeb: [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Ptolemy/Tetrabiblos/2B*.html#9 p.193]).&lt;/ref&gt;  It is noted that here Ptolemy uses principles that fall outside the neat theoretical logic he presents in book I, being explicable only in terms of the mythological and omen tradition inherited from his ancient sources.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Reference-Riley88|Riley (1988)]] p.76. In footnote 15 Riley also notes [[Franz Boll (philologist)|Franz Boll]]’s argument that Ptolemy borrowed the structure of some components of this book from [[Posidonius]].&lt;/ref&gt;  He also defends the  subjective nature of the analysis involved, asserting that it would be impossible to mention the proper outcome of all this investigation, which calls for enterprise and ingenuity from the astrologer creating the judgement.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Reference-Robbins_Tet|''Tetrabiblos'']] II.8 Loeb:  [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Ptolemy/Tetrabiblos/2B*.html#8 p.189]): "Consequently questions of this kind would reasonably be left to the enterprise and ingenuity of the mathematician, [i.e., astrologer] in order to make the particular distinctions".&lt;/ref&gt;

The remaining chapters of book II are dedicated to meteorological matters.  Chapter 10 specifies that the new or full Moon preceding the Sun’s ingress into Aries can be used as a starting point for investigations concerning the weather patterns of the year. Lunations which precede the Sun’s ingress into any the other equinoctial and solstice signs (Cancer, Libra and Capricorn) can also be used for  seasonal concerns, and within these "monthly investigations" bring more particular details based on lunations and the conjunctions of the planets.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Reference-Robbins_Tet|''Tetrabiblos'']] II.10 (Loeb: [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Ptolemy/Tetrabiblos/2C*.html#10 p.199]).&lt;/ref&gt;  The recorded weather effects of the fixed stars in the zodiac constellations are systematically discussed, concluding with the relevance of generally observed sky phenomena such as shooting stars, cloud formations and rainbows.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Reference-Robbins_Tet|''Tetrabiblos'']] II.13 (Loeb:   [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Ptolemy/Tetrabiblos/2C*.html#13 p.219]).&lt;/ref&gt;  These final considerations are expected to add localised details to the original exploration of eclipse cycles. Ptolemy's theme throughout the book is that charts of this nature cannot be judged in isolation, but are to be understood within the pattern of cycles to which they belong, and where there are strong connections between the degree points involved; for:

{{quote|In every case… one should draw his conclusions on the principle that the universal and primary underlying cause takes precedence and that the cause of particular events is secondary to it, and that the force is most ensured and strengthened when the stars which are the lords of the universal natures are configurated with the particular causes.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Reference-Robbins_Tet|''Tetrabiblos'']] II.12 (Loeb:   [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Ptolemy/Tetrabiblos/2C*.html#12 p.213]).&lt;/ref&gt;}}

With the astrologer expected to have knowledge and awareness of the mundane cycles that outline the background principles of the personal horoscope, Ptolemy closes this book with the promise that the next will supply "with due order" the procedure which allows predictions based on the horoscopes of individuals.

==Book III: Individual horoscopes (genetic influences and predispositions)==
[[File:GkHor.jpg|thumb|right|Byzantine reproduction of a Greek horoscope attributed to the philosopher [[Eutocius]], 497 A.D.]]
Books III and IV explore what Ptolemy terms "the genethlialogical art": the interpretation of a horoscope set for the moment of the birth of an individual.&lt;ref name="Tp221"&gt;[[#Reference-Robbins_Tet|''Tetrabiblos'']] III.1 (Loeb: [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Ptolemy/Tetrabiblos/3A*.html#1 pp.221–7]).&lt;/ref&gt;  He explains that there are several cycles of life to consider but the starting point for all investigation is the time of conception or birth.  The former "the genesis of the seed"” allows knowledge of events that precede the birth; the latter "the genesis of the man" is "more perfect in potentiality"&lt;ref name="Tp221" /&gt;  because when the child leaves the womb and comes "forth into the light under the appropriate conformation of the heavens" the temperament, disposition and physical form of the body is set.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Reference-Robbins_Tet|''Tetrabiblos'']] III.1 (Loeb: [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Ptolemy/Tetrabiblos/3A*.html#1 p.225]). This explanation was mirrored in subsequent discussions on why the moment of birth is more reliable, though not separate, from the moment of conception. For example, Johannes Kepler was following Ptolemy when he wrote in his ''Tertius Interveniens'' (1610): "When a human being's life is first ignited, when he now has his own life, and can no longer remain in the womb - then he receives a character and an imprint of all the celestial configurations (or the images of the rays intersecting on earth), and retains them unto his grave". See [http://cura.free.fr/docum/15kep-en.html 7.1] of ''Translated excerpts'' by Dr. Kenneth G. Negus on [http://cura.free.fr Cura], retrieved 17 November 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; The two moments are described as being linked by a "very similar causative power", so that the seed of the conception takes independent form at an astrologically suitable moment, whereby the impulse to give birth occurs under a "configuration of similar type to that which governed the child's formation in detail in the first place".&lt;ref name="Tp221" /&gt;  Chapter 2 continues this theme in discussing the importance of calculating the precise degree of the ascendant at birth, the difficulty of recording local time precisely enough to establish this,&lt;ref&gt;[[#Reference-Robbins_Tet|''Tetrabiblos'']] III.2 (Loeb: [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Ptolemy/Tetrabiblos/3A*.html#2 p.231]).&lt;/ref&gt;  and the methods available for [[Natal chart#Rectification|rectification]] (''i.e''., ensuring the chart is correct).&lt;ref&gt;Ptolemy’s method involves consideration of the preceding [[Syzygy (astronomy)|syzygy]] (New or Full Moon before birth). The text explains the principles of the ancient astrological technique elsewhere known as the 'Animodar method of rectification' (or 'System/Trutine of Hermes') which became a standard rectification procedure for Medieval and Renaissance astrologers.&lt;/ref&gt;

Chapter 3 describes how the analysis of the chart is divided into predictions of:
# essential, genetic qualities established prior to birth (such family and parental influences),
# those that become known at the birth (such as the sex of the child and birth defects), and
# those that can only be known post-natally (such as length of life, the quality of the mind, illnesses, marriage, children, and material fortunes).

Ptolemy explains the order by which each theme becomes relevant, and follows this in his arrangement of topics presented in the remaining chapters of books III and IV.

First he deals with the prenatal matters, covering the astrological significators of the parents in chapter 4, and siblings in chapter 5.  Then he deals with the matters "directly concerned with the birth",&lt;ref&gt;[[#Reference-Robbins_Tet|''Tetrabiblos'']] III.6 (Loeb: [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Ptolemy/Tetrabiblos/3A*.html#6  p.255]).&lt;/ref&gt;  explaining how to judge such issues as whether the child will be male or female (ch.6); whether the birth will produce twins or multiple children (ch.7); and whether it will involve physical defects or monstrous forms; if so, whether these are accompanied by mental deficiency, notability or honour (ch.8).&lt;ref&gt;For example ([http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Ptolemy/Tetrabiblos/3A*.html#8 III.8]): "if even in this case not one of the beneficent planets bears witness to any of the places mentioned, the offspring are entirely irrational and in the true sense of the word nondescript; but if Jupiter or Venus bears witness, the type of monster will be honoured and seemly, such as is usually the case with hermaphrodites or the so called harpocratiacs [deaf mutes]".&lt;/ref&gt;

The exploration of post-natal concerns begins in chapter 9 with a review of astrological factors that occur when children are not reared. This considers the indications of still births and babies that seem "half-dead", or those that have been left exposed (including whether  there is possibility they may be taken up and live). Chapter 10 then details the techniques for establishing the length of life under normal circumstances. This is an important and lengthy passage of text, the techniques of which require precise astronomical detail and advanced knowledge of complex progressive techniques. Jim Tester has commented on how Ptolemy goes into  an unusual level of detail&lt;ref&gt;[[#Reference-Tester-1987|Tester (1987)]] [https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=-szKaDqpFhUC&amp;lpg=PA84&amp;ots=aAB6g1toUX&amp;dq=Astrology%2C%20length%20of%20life%2C%20Ptolemy&amp;pg=PA84#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false p.84]: "That the topic was of great importance is shown by the length of Ptolemy’s chapter and the number of illustrations he gives to help the reader understand an immensely complex procedure.  This is very unusual since Ptolemy tends to avoid details of practice, and consequently needs and uses few illustrations".&lt;/ref&gt; in a responsibility that [[Auguste Bouché-Leclercq|Bouché-Leclercq]] described as "the chief task of astrology, the operation judged most difficult by practitioners, most dangerous and damnable by its enemies".&lt;ref&gt;[[#Reference-Tester-1987|Tester (1987)]] [https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=-szKaDqpFhUC&amp;lpg=PA84&amp;ots=aAB6g1toUX&amp;dq=Astrology%2C%20length%20of%20life%2C%20Ptolemy&amp;pg=PA84#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false p.84]. Original source given as ''L’astrologie greque'', 404 (Paris: Leroux, 1899).&lt;/ref&gt; Such a prediction  involves judicial skill as well as mathematical expertise since several 'destructive' periods may be identified but countered by other, protective astrological influences, resulting in periods of danger or illness that does not lead to death.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Reference-Robbins_Tet|''Tetrabiblos'']] III.10 (Loeb:  [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Ptolemy/Tetrabiblos/3B*.html#10 p.285]).&lt;/ref&gt; This is followed, in chapter 11, by the astrological principles from which judgement is made of bodily appearance and temperament. The planetary significations follow the logic of their humoral associations, so that Jupiter (associated with warmth and moisture, an humoral combination which promotes growth) gives largeness in bodily form.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Reference-Riley88|Riley (1988)]] p.68.&lt;/ref&gt;  Since these define, to some extent, predisposition towards bodily afflictions, there is a natural flow towards the content of chapter 12, which focuses on the astrological significators relating to injuries and diseases. The details of planetary associations with bodily organs and functions are given, such as Saturn ruling the spleen and Jupiter the lungs. Jim Tester has pointed out that several lists of this type exist "more or less agreeing in detail".&lt;ref name="tester61"&gt;[[#Reference-Tester-1987|Tester (1987)]]  [https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=L0HSvH96alIC&amp;lpg=PA57&amp;dq=Tester%20Ptolemy&amp;pg=PA61#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false p.61].&lt;/ref&gt;

The third book concludes with a discussion in chapters 13 and 14 of what is described as a "largely overlooked" facet of Ptolemaic doctrine: the "psychological" one, which concerns the quality of the soul (or ''psyche'').&lt;ref name="Cam"&gt;Campion, Nicholas, 'Astronomy and the Soul', in [[#Reference-Tym|Tymieniecka (2010)]] p.250.&lt;/ref&gt; Historian [[Nicholas Campion]] has discussed the roots of the notion that  celestial and psychological realms are connected, which can be traced to the 6th century BC, and in Ptolemy's case presents a mixture of [[Aristotelianism|Aristotelian]] and [[Stoicism|Stoic]] philosophy, resting on the [[Platonism|Platonic]] view that "the soul comes from the heavens" which explains "how human character comes to be determined by the heavens".&lt;ref&gt;Campion, Nicholas, 'Astronomy and the Soul', in [[#Reference-Tym|Tymieniecka (2010)]] p.251 (acknowledging reference to [[Van der Waerden]], Bartel, (1974) ''Science awakening'', vol. II, 'The birth of astronomy'. Leyden and New York: Oxford University Press).&lt;/ref&gt;

The soul, for Ptolemy,  includes the faculty for conscious reasoning, which is rational and attributed to the condition of Mercury, and the subconscious and unconscious elements of the mind (the "sensory and irrational part"), which is sensitive and attributed to the condition of the Moon.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Reference-Robbins_Tet|''Tetrabiblos'']] III.13 (Loeb: [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Ptolemy/Tetrabiblos/3D*.html#13 p.333]). See also Campion in [[#Reference-Tym|Tymieniecka (2010)]] p.251.&lt;/ref&gt; These two chapters make analysis of instinctual impulses and moral inclinations, being concerned with psychological motives and behavioural expression rather than the physical temperament described in chapter 11. Diseases of the soul are defined as "affections which are utterly disproportionate and as it were pathological"&lt;ref name="Tp365"&gt;[[#Reference-Robbins_Tet|''Tetrabiblos'']] III.14 (Loeb: [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Ptolemy/Tetrabiblos/3D*.html#4  pp.365–9]).&lt;/ref&gt;  including insanity, inability to exercise moderation or restraint, instability of the emotions, depraved sexuality, morbid perversions, and violent afflictions of the intellectual and passive parts of the mind. The astrological explanations are mainly related to the exaggerated influence of destructive planets which are also in difficult configurations with Mercury and the Sun or Moon, or the planet associated with the psychological impulse (for example, Venus in matters of sexuality).&lt;ref name="Tp365" /&gt; Campion has pointed out that these planetary associations with psychological qualities are not original to Ptolemy, being present in the ''[[Corpus Hermeticum]]'' which was in circulation in Alexandria at the time Ptolemy compiled his text.&lt;ref name="Cam" /&gt;{{Rp|254}}

Within this book Ptolemy has surveyed all the topics that relate to inner qualities, genetic patterns, predispositions and the natural tendencies present from birth.  His exploration of individual horoscopes continues into book IV, the only distinction of content being that subsequent topics relate to material matters and life experiences: what Ptolemy refers to as "external accidentals".&lt;ref name="IVi"&gt;[[#Reference-Robbins_Tet|''Tetrabiblos'']] IV.1 (Loeb: [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Ptolemy/Tetrabiblos/4A*.html#1 p.373]).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Book IV: Individual horoscopes (external accidentals)==
[[File:Ptolemaicsystem-small.png|left|thumb|Ptolemy's geocentric celestial spheres; Peter Apian's ''Cosmographia'' (1539)]] 
Book IV is presented with a brief introduction to reaffirm  the arrangement of content as previously described. It starts with the topics of riches and honour. Ptolemy says: "as material fortune is associated with the properties of the body, so honour belongs to those of the soul".&lt;ref name="IVi" /&gt;  Chapter 2, on material wealth, employs the "so-called '[[Part of fortune|Lot of Fortune]]'" although Ptolemy's instruction conflicts with that of many of his contemporaries in stating that for its calculation "we measure from the horoscope the distance from the sun to the moon, in both diurnal and nocturnal nativities".&lt;ref&gt;[[#Reference-Robbins_Tet|''Tetrabiblos'']] IV.1 (Loeb: [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Ptolemy/Tetrabiblos/4A*.html#1  p.373]).&lt;/ref&gt;  Ptolemy's reputation ensured this approach to calculation was adopted by many later Medieval and Renaissance astrologers,&lt;ref&gt;[[#Reference-Lilly|Lilly (1647)]] p.143, (for example) repeats the instruction according to Ptolemy in his chapter 23: 'Of the Part of Fortune and how to take it, either by day or night'.&lt;/ref&gt; although it is now realised that most Hellenistic astrologers reversed the formula of calculation for [[Astrology of sect|nocturnal births]]. It is notable that in his discussion "Of the fortune of Dignity", in chapter three, Ptolemy makes no reference to the [[Part of fortune|Lot of Spirit]] (or ''Daimon''), which would normally be used as the spiritual counterpart to the material wealth and happiness associated with the Lot of Fortune. This is viewed as a demonstration of his general dislike (declared in bk. III.3)  for "lots and numbers of which no reasonable explanation can be given".&lt;ref&gt;Greenbaum, Dorian G., 'Calculating the Lots of Fortune and Daemon in Hellenistic astrology', in [[#Reference-Burnett|Burnett and Greenbaum (2007)]] pp.171–173, 184–5.&lt;/ref&gt;

The subsequent chapter, the title of which is translated by Robbins as 'Of the Quality of Action', concerns professional inclinations and the significators of career advance (or decline). This is followed by the treatment of marriage in chapter 5, which is primarily referred to the Moon in a man's chart, to describe his wife, and the Sun in a woman's chart to describe her husband.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Reference-Robbins_Tet|''Tetrabiblos'']] IV.5 (Loeb: [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Ptolemy/Tetrabiblos/4B*.html#5 pp.393–5]).&lt;/ref&gt; Here Ptolemy shows employment of the astrological technique known as [[synastry]], in which the planetary positions of two separate horoscopes are compared with each other for indications of relationship harmony or enmity.

The next four chapters complete the survey of natal themes, dealing with the topics of children (ch.6); friends and enemies (ch.7); the dangers of foreign travel (ch.8) and the quality (or type) of death (ch.9 – as opposed to the time of death considered in III.10).

The final chapter of the work is described as "a curious one"&lt;ref&gt;[[#Reference-Tester-1987|Tester (1987)]] [https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=-szKaDqpFhUC&amp;lpg=PA84&amp;ots=aAB6g1toUX&amp;dq=Astrology%2C%20length%20of%20life%2C%20Ptolemy&amp;pg=PA84#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false p.84].&lt;/ref&gt; for introducing a separate theme at the end of the book. This refers to the seven 'ages of man', which Ptolemy briefly mentioned in III.1 as a matter which varies the emphasis of astrological configurations according to the time in life they occur: "we predict events that will come about at specific times and vary in degree, following the so called ages of life.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Reference-Robbins_Tet|''Tetrabiblos'']] III.3 (Loeb:  [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Ptolemy/Tetrabiblos/3A*.html#1 p.223]).&lt;/ref&gt;
His argument is that, just as an astrologer must consider cultural differences "lest he mistake the appropriate customs and manners by assigning, for example, marriage with a sister to one who is Italian by race, instead of to the Egyptian as he should",&lt;ref name="bare_url"&gt;[[#Reference-Robbins_Tet|''Tetrabiblos'']] IV.10 (Loeb:  [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Ptolemy/Tetrabiblos/4C*.html#10 pp.439–441]).&lt;/ref&gt; it is necessary to consider the age in life that important astrological events occur. This is to ensure the prediction will "harmonise those details which are contemplated in temporal terms with that which is suitable and possible for persons in the various age-classes" and avoid out-of-context predictions such as imminent marriage for a young child, or "to an extremely old man the begetting of children or anything else that fits younger men".&lt;ref name="bare_url" /&gt; This leads into a discussion of the planetary themes of the seven ages of life which:

{{quote|...for likeness and comparison depends upon the order of the seven planets; it begins with the first age of man and with the first sphere from us, that is, the moon's, and ends with the last of the ages and the outermost of the planetary spheres, which is called that of Saturn.&lt;ref name="bare_url" /&gt;}}

The information in the passage can be summarised as follows:&lt;ref&gt;[[#Reference-Robbins_Tet|''Tetrabiblos'']] IV.10 (Loeb:  [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Ptolemy/Tetrabiblos/4C*.html#10 pp.443–447]).&lt;/ref&gt;

The book ends with a brief discussion of astronomical and symbolic cycles used in the prediction of timed events, which includes mention of (primary) directions, annual profections, ingresses, lunations and transits.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Reference-Robbins_Tet|''Tetrabiblos'']] IV.10 (Loeb:  [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Ptolemy/Tetrabiblos/4C*.html#10 pp.451–455]). For more on these techniques see [[Astrological progression]].&lt;/ref&gt;

The translator of the [[Loeb]] 1940 English translation, F. E. Robbins, reports a "puzzling problem" regarding the final paragraph of the book. One group of manuscripts have either been left unconcluded or supplied with text that matches an ''Anonymous Paraphrase'' of the work (speculatively attributed to Proclus); the other presents text which is the same in general content, but longer, according with manuscripts that were transmitted through Arabic translations.&lt;ref name="ending"&gt;[[#Reference-Robbins_Tet|Robbins (1940)]] 'Translator's Introduction',  [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Ptolemy/Tetrabiblos/Introduction*.html p.xxi].&lt;/ref&gt; Robbins considers it certain that the ending which concurs with the text of the ''Paraphrase'' is spurious. Robert Schmidt, the English translator of the later [[Project Hindsight]] edition agrees with his choice, stating that the text of the latter "sounds more generally Ptolemaic".&lt;ref&gt;[[#Reference-Schmidt|Schmidt (1998)]] book IV, p.50.&lt;/ref&gt;

Robbins explains that the lack of an ending usually occurs when ancient books are compiled in the form of a [[codex]] rather than a roll. Since the ''Paraphrase'' edition of the ''Tetrabiblos'' aimed to present the work's meaning without Ptolemy’s own complicated style of text construction, Robbins says that he "cannot conceive how anyone (except perhaps Ptolemy) could have reversed the process and evolved the tortuous, crabbed Greek of the latter from the comparatively simple language of the former".&lt;ref name="ending" /&gt; He therefore offers both versions of the ending whilst lending his support to that which is found in the Arabic version of the text. This has the book conclude with Ptolemy declaring  "since the topic of nativities has been summarily reviewed, it would be well to bring this procedure also to a fitting close".&lt;ref&gt;[[#Reference-Robbins_Tet|''Tetrabiblos'']] IV.10 (Loeb:  [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Ptolemy/Tetrabiblos/4C*.html#10 p.459]). See also [[#Reference-Robbins_Tet|Robbins (1940)]] 'Translator's Introduction', [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Ptolemy/Tetrabiblos/Introduction*.html  p.xxi] for discussion of the variants. The comment quoted is from  the ending according to Parisinus 2425.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Editions and translations ==
No original manuscripts of the text have survived; its contents are known from translations, fragments, paraphrased copies, commentaries and later Greek manuscripts.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Reference-Riley|Riley (1974)]] p.235.&lt;/ref&gt;  Astrological researcher Deborah Houlding, in an analysis of how specific points agree or vary between different editions, suggests that areas of conflicting details have been affected by three main streams of transmission: manuscripts that have passed through Arabic translation; those based on a paraphrased edition, and manuscripts that are dated four centuries later than the Arabic ones, but which have not undergone translation out of Greek.&lt;ref name="HT"&gt;Houlding, Deborah 'Ptolemy's terms and conditions: the transmission of Ptolemy's terms; an historical overview, comparison and interpretation', in [[#Reference-Burnett|Burnett and Greenbaum (2007)]]; reproduced online at [http://www.skyscript.co.uk/pdf/Houlding_ptolemy_terms.pdf Skyscript] (see p.3–4,6,11,15); retrieved 7 December 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Arabic translations===
The oldest extant manuscript is an Arabic translation compiled in the 9th century by [[Hunayn ibn Ishaq]]. This was first translated into Latin, in Barcelona, by [[Plato Tiburtinus|Plato de Tivoli]] in 1138 and became influential as the first complete introduction of Ptolemy's astrological work in Medieval Europe. It  survives in at least nine manuscripts and five Renaissance printings.&lt;ref&gt;See Houlding in [[#Reference-Burnett|Burnett and Greenbaum (2007)]] p.277; and Charles Burnett's 'notice' in the preface to the reproduction of Plato de Tivoli's translation by Johannes Hervagius in 1533 (available in digital format by the [http://warburg.sas.ac.uk/pdf/fah750pto.pdf Warburg Institute] (retrieved 19 November 2011).&lt;/ref&gt;

Other Latin translations made from Arabic sources include an anonymous (unpublished) work compiled in 1206 and another of the 13th century by Egidio Tebaldi (Aegidius de Thebaldis).&lt;ref&gt;Heilen, Stephan, 'Ptolemy's Doctrine of the Terms and its Reception', in [[#Reference-Jones-2010|Jones (2010)]] p.70.&lt;/ref&gt; Typically, the Latin translations made from Arabic texts were circulated with a commentary compiled by [[Ali ibn Ridwan]] (Haly) in the 11th century.&lt;ref name="w"&gt;[[#Reference-Westman|Westman (2011)]] p.43&lt;/ref&gt;

Egidio Tebaldi's translation was first published by [[Erhard Ratdolt]] in 1484 together with Haly's commentary and a "pseudo-Ptolemaic" list of aphorisms known as the ''[[Centiloquium]]''. This has been described as "the creature of late-fifteenth-century Italian presses".&lt;ref name="w" /&gt;

===Paraphrase based editions===
An anonymous Greek paraphrase is speculatively attributed to the 5th-century philosopher [[Proclus]]. It is often referred to as the ''Proclus' Paraphrase'' although its authenticity is questioned, being described as "very doubtful" by Professor Stephan Heilen.&lt;ref name="heilen"&gt;Heilen, Stephan, 'Ptolemy's Doctrine of the Terms and its Reception', in [[#Reference-Jones-2010|Jones (2010)]], [https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=Y61qolT7m98C&amp;lpg=PA66&amp;ots=6eFk3oRj6L&amp;dq=Porphyry%20paraphrase%20ptolemy&amp;pg=PA45#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false pp.62–63].&lt;/ref&gt;  The content of the ''Paraphrase'' is close to that of manuscripts of the ''Tetrabiblos'', but it uses simplified text  with the aim of providing what Heilen calls "a more easily understandable version of the difficult original work".&lt;ref name="heilen" /&gt;

There is no modern critical edition of this text.&lt;ref name="heilen" /&gt; The oldest extant manuscript is dated to the 10th century and housed in the [[Vatican Library]] (Ms. ''Vaticanus gr.1453, S. X.'', ff.1–219).&lt;ref name="HT" /&gt;{{Rp|269}} Some of the text of the ''Paraphrase'' was published with a Latin translation and Preface by [[Philipp Melanchthon]] in Basel, 1554, but this was not widely circulated.&lt;ref name="HT" /&gt;{{Rp|265}}  A full reproduction with an accompanying Latin translation was made around 1630 by the Vatican scholar [[Leo Allatius]] "for his own private gratification" and this was published by the [[House of Elzevir|Elzevir]] typsetters in [[Leiden]], 1635, apparently without Allatius's knowledge or consent.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Reference-Ashmans|Ashmand (1822)]] 'Preface' [http://www.sacred-texts.com/astro/ptb/ptb03.htm#fn_8 pp.xvii]. The unknown author of the 'Address' in the 1635 Elzevir edition reports that it "was translated a few years ago" and says of its author Allatius: "He ... holds some office in the Vatican Library. He undertook his present work, however, for his own private gratification, and that of certain friends; but when writings compiled with this view have once quitted their author's hands, it will often happen that they have also, at the same time, escaped his control."&lt;/ref&gt;

Allatius' Latin translation was used as the source of all English translations of the ''Tetrabiblos'' prior to the Robbins' edition of 1940.&lt;ref name="HT" /&gt;{{Rp|266}} These include translations made by John Whalley (1701); the Whalley "corrected edition" made by [[Ebenezer Sibly]] and his brother (1786); J.M. Ashmand (1822); James Wilson (1828); and other 19th-century privately circulated manuscripts such as that of John Worsdale.&lt;ref&gt;See Houlding, in [[#Reference-Burnett|Burnett and Greenbaum (2007)]], p.266 n.12, for discussion of the earlier English language editions.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Greek manuscripts===
Although no copies of Ptolemy's original manuscript remain, there are other ancient works, such as [[Hephaistio]]'s ''Apotelesmatics I'',  which describe or reproduce some of its passages. These have been used to help verify disputed areas of content.&lt;ref name="HT" /&gt;{{Rp|275}}

The oldest fairly complete Greek manuscript of the text (rather than the paraphrased edition made of it) is dated to the 13th century. Two or three others are dated to the 14th century but most are dated to the 15th and 16th centuries.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Reference-Robbins_Tet|Robbins (1940)]] 'Translator's Introduction' IV, in particular  [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Ptolemy/Tetrabiblos/Introduction*.html p.xviii]. See also [[#Reference-Hubner|Hübner (1998)]] p.xiii.&lt;/ref&gt; In the 'Introduction' to his 1940's translation, Frank Eggleston Robbins reported the existence of at least 35 manuscripts containing all or a large part of the ''Tetrabiblos'' in European libraries.&lt;ref name=RR&gt;[[#Reference-Robbins_Tet|Robbins (1940)]] 'Translator's Introduction' [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Ptolemy/Tetrabiblos/Introduction*.html p.xxiii].&lt;/ref&gt;

The first printed edition was made in 1535 with an accompanying Latin translation by the German classical scholar [[Joachim Camerarius]]. This was reprinted in 1553 and is "notable for offering the first Latin translation based upon a Greek rather than Arabic source".&lt;ref name="HT" /&gt;{{Rp|269}} Robbins noted the page numbers of the 1553 edition in the Greek text which faces his English translation, stating "My collations have been made against Camerarius' second edition, because thus far this has been the standard text and it was most convenient".&lt;ref name="RR" /&gt;

Also in 1940, a Greek critical edition was published by [[Teubner]], in Germany, based on the unpublished work of [[Franz Boll (philologist)|Franz Boll]] which was completed by his student Emilie Boer. Robbins expressed regret at not being able to refer to this in the preparation of his English translation.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Reference-Robbins_Tet|Robbins (1940)]] 'Translator's Introduction' [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Ptolemy/Tetrabiblos/Introduction*.html p.xiv]: "Professor Franz Boll, whose studies of Ptolemy have been cited many times already, had begun work upon a new edition of the ''Tetrabiblos'' prior to his lamented death, July 3, 1924. His pupil, Fräulein Emilie Boer, however, continued Boll’s task, and the appearance of their completed text has been awaited since 1926. I regret very much that my own work on the present text and translation could not have profited from the results of the textual studies of these two scholars".&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1994 the 'Boll-Boer' edition became the basis of a serialised English translation by Robert Schmidt, published by [[Project Hindsight]]. The 'Translator's Preface' was critical of Robbins' understanding of some of the "conceptual issues involved" and argued the need for a new English translation which recognised the "probable superiority of the Teubner text edited by Boll and Boer in 1940".&lt;ref&gt;[[#Reference-Schmidt|Schmidt (1994)]] book I, p.vii–viii.&lt;/ref&gt;

The most recent critical edition of the Greek text was made by the German scholar Professor Wolfgang Hübner, and published by Teubner in 1998. Based on 33 complete and 14 partial manuscripts, Hübner also incorporated the unpublished notes of Boer and the reasoning given in the Robbins and Boll-Boer editions.&lt;ref name="HT" /&gt;{{Rp|273}} This is now considered the authoritative edition. A reviewer’s comment in The ''Classical Review'' declares of it "Progress over previous editions is evident on virtually every page".&lt;ref&gt;Tiziano Dorandi, ''The Classical Review'' (2000), New Series, Vol. 50, No. 1, pp. 30–32 (reported by Houlding in [[#Reference-Burnett|Burnett and Greenbaum (2007)]] p.273).&lt;/ref&gt;

===Commentary===
In addition to the Arabic commentary on the ''Tetrabiblos'' made by [[Ali ibn Ridwan]] (Haly) in the 11th century,&lt;ref name="G"&gt;[[#Reference-Grafton|Grafton (1999)]] [https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=GhkxjStiZfwC&amp;lpg=PA137&amp;dq=centiloquium%20ptolemy&amp;pg=PA137#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false pp.136–7].&lt;/ref&gt;
significant attention is given to an anonymous Greek ''Commentary'', which has older, obscure origins. It was written at an uncertain date, in either late antiquity or the [[Byzantine]] period. This is also attributed to Proclus, as the presumed author of the ''Paraphrase'', although Heilen has remarked that such an attribution "looks like guesswork".&lt;ref name="heilen3"&gt;Heilen, Stephan, 'Ptolemy's Doctrine of the Terms and its Reception', in [[#Reference-Jones-2010|Jones (2010)]], [https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=Y61qolT7m98C&amp;lpg=PA66&amp;ots=6eFk3oRj6L&amp;dq=Porphyry%20paraphrase%20ptolemy&amp;pg=PA45#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false pp.65–66].&lt;/ref&gt;  Houlding has also pointed out that differences in tabulated information presented within the ''Paraphrase'' and the ''Commentary'' "is a telling argument that both cannot be the work of the same author".&lt;ref name="HT" /&gt;{{Rp|274}}

The Greek ''Commentary'' was first printed in 1559 with an accompanying Latin translation by [[Hieronymus Wolf]]. This claimed to be based on a heavily corrupted manuscript which required numerous conjectures by a scholarly friend of Wolf, who preferred to remain anonymous rather than face reproaches for "dabbling in this sort of literature".&lt;ref name="heilen3" /&gt; Wolf's edition was bound with an ''Introduction to the Tetrabiblos'', attributed (speculatively) to [[Porphyry (philosopher)|Porphyry]], and the [[scholia]] of Demophilus.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Reference-Robbins_Tet|Robbins (1940)]] 'Translator's Introduction', III [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Ptolemy/Tetrabiblos/Introduction*.html p.xvi].&lt;/ref&gt;

The purpose of the ''Commentary'' was to offer demonstrated illustrations and fuller explanation of the astrological principles described by Ptolemy. Following Wolf's edition, large passages were incorporated into Latin astrological works which featured extensive collections of example horoscopes. Two notable examples are [[Jerome Cardan]]'s ''Ptolemaei De Astrorvm Ivdiciis'' (Basel, 1578) and [[Francisco Junctinus]]'s ''Speculum Astrologiae'' (Lugduni, 1583).&lt;ref name="HT" /&gt;{{Rp|273}} Modern translators continue to make reference to the Hieronymous Wolf ''Commentary'' in their explanatory annotations.&lt;ref&gt;See for example, [[#Reference-Robbins_Tet|Robbins (1940)]] [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Ptolemy/Tetrabiblos/1B*.html#note110 p.98, n.2] and [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Ptolemy/Tetrabiblos/1B*.html#note116 p.106, n.2].&lt;/ref&gt;

===Centiloquium===
{{Main|Centiloquium}}
The  ''[[Centiloquium]]'' 'one hundred (sayings)' was the common Latin title of a  collection of 100 important astrological [[aphorism]]s. It was also known in Latin as ''Liber Fructus'' (Arabic: ''Kitab al-Tamara''; Hebrew: ''Sefer ha-Peri'') 'Book of the Fruit'.&lt;ref name="Sela"&gt;[[#Reference-Sela-2003|Sela (2003)]] [https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=HvCns2cU6f0C&amp;pg=PA321 pp.321–2].&lt;/ref&gt; The latter reflected the belief that this offered a summation of Ptolemy's key astrological principles, and therefore presented "The Fruit of his Four Books".&lt;ref name="Hould-2006"&gt;[[#Reference-Houlding-2006|Houlding (2006)]] [http://www.skyscript.co.uk/centiloquium1.html 'Introduction'].&lt;/ref&gt; It began, as all Ptolemy's works did, with a dedication to "Syrus", which helped support the assumption of the work's Ptolemaic authenticity.&lt;ref name="G" /&gt;

Early manuscripts were commonly accompanied by a commentary on their use authored by [[Ahmad ibn Yusuf al-Misri]] (835–912).&lt;ref name="Sela" /&gt; This became translated into Latin at the same time as translations were being made of the Arabic editions of the ''Tetrabiblos''. The earliest translations were made by [[John of Seville|Johannes Hispanensis]] in 1136 and [[Plato Tiburtinus|Plato of Tivoli]] in 1138.&lt;ref name="Hould-2006" /&gt;

[[Ali ibn Ridwan]] (Haly), who had produced the Arabic commentary on Ptolemy's work, noticed that the aphorisms highlighted principles of [[horary astrology|interrogational]] astrology, and wondered why Ptolemy had not included coverage of these themes in his ''Tetrabiblos''.&lt;ref name="G" /&gt; Jerome Cardan was the first to declare the work a forgery based on such differences, referring in his commentary on the ''Tetrabiblos'' to an argument of [[Galen]]: "In the old days, kings who were trying to establish great libraries bought the books of famous men at very high prices. By doing so they caused men to ascribe their own works to the ancients".&lt;ref name="G" /&gt;

The authorship of the text is now ascribed to "Pseudo-Ptolemy". Some scholars suggest that Ahmad ibn Yusuf was its true author.&lt;ref name="Sela" /&gt; Others believe that the ''Centiloquium'', though not Ptolemy's, may preserve some collation of authentic materials from [[Hellenistic astrology]].&lt;ref&gt;[[#Reference-Houlding-2006|Houlding (2006)]] [http://www.skyscript.co.uk/centiloquium1.html 'Introduction']; [[#Reference-Tester-1987|Tester (1987)]] pp.[https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=L0HSvH96alIC&amp;pg=PA154 154–5].&lt;/ref&gt; Ultimately, the historical assumption that the ''Centiloquium'' was part of Ptolemy's astrological legacy gave it widespread influence in the medieval period, by which it became established as an important text within the astrological tradition.&lt;ref name="Hould-2006" /&gt;

"'''The Geographical Pivot of History'''" is an article submitted by [[Halford John Mackinder]] in 1904 to the [[Royal Geographical Society]] that advances his heartland theory.&lt;ref name="MackinderHistory"&gt;Mackinder, H.J., "[http://intersci.ss.uci.edu/wiki/eBooks/Articles/1904%20HEARTLAND%20THEORY%20HALFORD%20MACKINDER.pdf The Geographical Pivot of History]", ''The Geographical Journal'', Vol. 23, No.4, (April 1904), 421-437&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="MackinderDemocratic"&gt;Mackinder, H.J., ''[http://mercury.ethz.ch/serviceengine/Files/ISN/139619/ipublicationdocument_singledocument/eda9e313-7e1b-41f3-a9d7-44b84da4ae5f/en/1942_Democratic_Ideals_Reality.pdf Democratic Ideals and Reality.

==The World-Island and the Heartland==
[[Image:Heartland.png|right|500px|Map of the "Heartland Theory", as published by Mackinder in 1904.]]
According to Mackinder, the Earth's land surface was divisible into:
*The '''World-Island''', comprising the interlinked continents of [[Europe]], [[Asia]], and [[Africa]]. This was the largest, most populous, and richest of all possible land combinations.
*The '''offshore islands''', including the [[British Isles]] and the [[Japan|islands of Japan]].
*The '''outlying islands''', including the [[continents]] of [[North America]], [[South America]], and [[Australia]].

The '''Heartland''' lay at the centre of the world island, stretching from the [[Volga]] to the [[Yangtze]] and from the [[Himalayas]] to the [[Arctic]]. Mackinder's Heartland was the area then ruled by the [[Russian Empire]] and after that by the [[Soviet Union]], minus the [[Kamchatka Peninsula]] region, which is located in the easternmost part of Russia, near the Aleutian Islands and Kurile islands.

==Strategic importance of Eastern Europe==
Later, in 1919, Mackinder summarised his theory as:
:::"Who rules East Europe commands the Heartland;
:::who rules the Heartland commands the World-Island;
:::who rules the World-Island commands the world."
:::(Mackinder, ''Democratic Ideals and Reality'', p. 150)

Any power which controlled the World-Island would control well over 50% of the world's resources. The Heartland's size and central position made it the key to controlling the World-Island.

The vital question was how to secure control for the Heartland. This question may seem pointless, since in 1904 the [[Russian Empire]] had ruled most of the area from the Volga to Eastern Siberia for centuries. But throughout the nineteenth century:
*The West European powers had combined, usually successfully, in the [[Great Game]] to prevent Russian expansion.
*The Russian Empire was huge but socially, politically and technologically backward—i.e., inferior in "virility, equipment and organization".

Mackinder held that effective political domination of the Heartland by a single power had been unattainable in the past because:
*The Heartland was protected from sea power by ice to the north and mountains and deserts to the south.
*Previous land invasions from east to west and vice versa were unsuccessful because lack of efficient transportation made it impossible to assure a continual stream of men and supplies.

He outlined the following ways in which the Heartland might become a springboard for global domination in the twentieth century (Sempa, 2000):
*Successful invasion of Russia by a West European nation (most probably [[Germany]]). Mackinder believed that the introduction of the [[railroad]] had removed the Heartland's invulnerability to land invasion. As [[Eurasia]] began to be covered by an extensive network of railroads, there was an excellent chance that a powerful continental nation could extend its political control over the [[Eastern Europe]]an gateway to the Eurasian landmass. In Mackinder's words, "Who rules East Europe commands the Heartland."
*A Russo-German alliance. Before 1917 both countries were ruled by [[Autocracy|autocrat]]s (the [[Tsar]] and the [[Kaiser]]), and both could have been attracted to an alliance against the democratic powers of Western Europe (the US was [[isolationist]] regarding European affairs, until it became a participant of [[World War I]] in 1917). Germany would have contributed to such an alliance its formidable army and its large and growing sea power.
*Conquest of Russia by a Sino-Japanese empire (see below).
The combined empire's large East Asian coastline would also provide the potential for it to become a major sea power. Mackinder's "Who rules East Europe commands the Heartland ..." does not cover this scenario, probably because the previous 2 scenarios were seen as the major risks of the nineteenth century and the early 1900s.

One of Mackinder's personal objectives was to warn Britain that its traditional reliance on sea power would become a weakness as improved land transport opened up the Heartland for invasion and / or industrialisation (Sempa, 2000).

==Influence of the theory on foreign and military policy==
[[Image:Pivot area.png|thumb|500px|Colour representation, using a modern projection of the world.]]

===In the Western powers===
Mackinder identified the geopolitical nightmare that was to haunt the world's two sea powers during the first half of the twentieth century—[[United Kingdom|Great Britain]] and, later the [[United States]].

==Influence of the theory on other geopolitical models==
Signs of Mackinder's Heartland Theory can be found in the works of geopolitician [[Dimitri Kitsikis]], particularly in his "[[Intermediate Region]]" model. There is a significant geographical overlap between the Heartland or "Pivot Area" and the Intermediate Region, with the exception of [[Germany]]-[[Prussia]] and north-eastern [[China]], which Kitsikis excludes from the Intermediate Region. Mackinder, on the other hand, excludes [[North Africa]], [[Eastern Europe]] and the [[Middle East]] from the Heartland. The reason for this difference is that Mackinder's model is primarily geo-strategic, while Kitsikis' model is geo-civilizational. However, the roles of both the Intermediate Region and the Heartland are regarded by their respective authors as being pivotal in the shaping of world history.

==Criticism==
K. S. Gadzhev, in his book ''Vvedenie v geopolitiku'' (''Introduction to Geopolitics'') raises a series of objections to Mackinder's Heartland to start with that the significance physiography is given there for [[political strategy]] is a form of [[geographical determinism]].&lt;ref&gt;Anita Sengupta, ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=zGn8qSgtc08C&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;hl=en Heartlands of Eurasia: The Geopolitics of Political Space]'', Lexington Books, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Giambologna sabine.jpg|thumb|''The Kidnapping of the Sabine Women'' by [[Giambologna]], in the [[Loggia dei Lanzi]] in Florence]]
{{Campaignbox Apocryphal Roman Wars}}

'''The Rape of the Sabine Women''' was an incident in [[Roman mythology]] in which the men of Rome committed a [[Bride kidnapping|mass abduction]] of young women from the other cities in the region.  It has been a frequent subject of artists, particularly during the [[Renaissance]] and post-Renaissance eras.

The word "rape" is the conventional translation of the [[Latin]] word ''[[raptio]]'' used in the ancient accounts of the incident. Modern scholars tend to interpret the word as "abduction" or "kidnapping" as opposed to a [[rape|sexual assault]].  Controversy remains, however, as to how the acts committed against the women should be judged.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Packman ZM |url=http://journals.co.za/docserver/fulltext/scholia/8/1/scholia_v8_a3.pdf?expires=1480217427&amp;id=id&amp;accname=guest&amp;checksum=4ABED64BF8B19FE8D2E3E99593E3DC0D |title=Rape and consequences in the Latin declamations |journal=Scholia: Studies in Classical Antiquity vol. 8 |date=January 1999 |page=34|accessdate=26 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Story==
[[File:Cortona Rape of the Sabine Women 01.jpg|thumb|''Rape of the Sabine Women'' by [[Pietro da Cortona]], 1627–1629.]]
The Rape occurred in the early history of Rome, shortly after its founding by [[Romulus]] and his mostly male followers. Seeking wives in order to establish families, the Romans negotiated unsuccessfully with the [[Sabines]], who populated the surrounding area. The Sabines feared the emergence of a rival society and refused to allow their women to marry the Romans.  Consequently, the Romans planned to abduct Sabine women during a festival of [[Neptune (mythology)|Neptune Equester]]. They planned and announced a marvelous festival to attract people from all nearby towns. According to Livy, many people from Rome's neighboring towns attended, including folk from the [[Caenina (Town)|Caeninenses]], [[Crustumerium|Crustumini]], and [[Antemnae|Antemnates]], and many of the Sabines.  At the festival, Romulus gave a signal, at which the Romans grabbed the Sabine women and fought off the Sabine men.  The indignant abductees were soon implored by Romulus to accept Roman husbands.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gutenberg.org/files/19725/19725-h/19725-h.htm#a10 Livy, Ab Urbe Condita Book 1 Ch. 9, p.15].&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Livy]] claims that no direct sexual assault took place, albeit the fuller evidence, when compared with the later history, suggests a seduction based on promises by the Romans and then betrayal of those promises. Livy says that Romulus offered them free choice and promised civic and property rights to women. According to Livy, Romulus spoke to them each in person, declaring "that what was done was owing to the pride of their fathers, who had refused to grant the privilege of marriage to their neighbours; but notwithstanding, they should be joined in lawful wedlock, participate in all their possessions and civil privileges, and, than which nothing can be dearer to the human heart, in their common children."&lt;ref name="Livy"&gt;Livy, ''[[Ab Urbe Condita Libri (Livy)|Ab urbe condita]]'' [http://www.gutenberg.org/files/19725/19725-h/19725-h.htm#a9 1.9].&lt;/ref&gt;

==War with Sabines and other tribes==

[[File:Stella, Jacques, The Rape of the Sabines, mid 17th century.jpg|thumb|[[Jacques Stella]], ''The Rape of the Sabines'', mid 17th century, [[Princeton University Art Museum]]]]

Outraged at the occurrence, the king of the Caeninenses entered upon Roman territory with his army.  Romulus and the Romans met the Caeninenses in battle, killed their king, and routed their army. Romulus later attacked Caenina and took it upon the first assault. Returning to Rome, he dedicated a temple to [[Feretrius|Jupiter Feretrius]] (according to Livy, the first temple dedicated in Rome) and offered the spoils of the enemy king as ''[[spolia opima]]''. According to the [[Roman triumph#The Fasti Triumphales|Fasti Triumphales]], Romulus celebrated a triumph over the Caeninenses on 1 March 752 BC.&lt;ref&gt;[[Livy]], ''[[Ab Urbe Condita Libri (Livy)|Ab urbe condita]]'', [http://www.gutenberg.org/files/19725/19725-h/19725-h.htm#a10 1.10]&lt;/ref&gt;

At the same time, the army of the Antemnates invaded Roman territory. The Romans retaliated, and the Antemnates were defeated in battle and their town captured. According to the ''Fasti Triumphales,'' Romulus celebrated a second triumph in 752 BC over the Antemnates.

The Crustumini also started a war, but they too were defeated and their town captured.

Roman [[Colonia (Roman)|colonists]] subsequently were sent to Antemnae and Crustumerium by Romulus, and many citizens of those towns also migrated to Rome (particularly the families of the captured women).

The Sabines themselves finally declared war, led into battle by their king, [[Titus Tatius]]. Tatius almost succeeded in capturing Rome, thanks to the treason of [[Tarpeia]], daughter of [[Spurius Tarpeius]], Roman governor of the citadel on the [[Capitoline Hill]]. She opened the city gates for the Sabines in return for "what they bore on their arms", thinking she would receive their golden bracelets. Instead, the Sabines crushed her to death with their shields, and her body was thrown from a rock known ever since by her name, the [[Tarpeian Rock]].

The Romans [[Battle of the Lacus Curtius|attacked]] the Sabines, who now held the citadel. The Roman advance was led by [[Hostus Hostilius]], the Sabine defence by Mettus Curtius. Hostus fell in battle, and the Roman line gave way. They retreated to the gate of the Palatium. Romulus rallied his men by promising to build a temple to [[Jupiter (mythology)|Jupiter Stator]] on the site. He then led them back into battle. Mettus Curtius was unhorsed and fled on foot, and the Romans appeared to be winning.

At this point, however, the Sabine women intervened:

{{bquote|[They], from the outrage on whom the war originated, with hair dishevelled and garments rent, the timidity of their sex being overcome by such dreadful scenes, had the courage to throw themselves amid the flying weapons, and making a rush across, to part the incensed armies, and assuage their fury; imploring their fathers on the one side, their husbands on the other, "that as fathers-in-law and sons-in-law they would not contaminate each other with impious blood, nor stain their offspring with parricide, the one their grandchildren, the other their children. If you are dissatisfied with the affinity between you, if with our marriages, turn your resentment against us; we are the cause of war, we of wounds and of bloodshed to our husbands and parents. It were better that we perish than live widowed or fatherless without one or other of you."&lt;ref&gt;Livy, ''[[Ab Urbe Condita Libri (Livy)|Ab urbe condita]]'' [http://www.gutenberg.org/files/19725/19725-h/19725-h.htm#a13 1.13]&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The battle came to an end, and the Sabines agreed to unite in one nation with the Romans. Titus Tatius jointly ruled with Romulus until Tatius's death five years later.

The new Sabine residents of Rome settled on the Capitoline Hill, which they had captured in the battle.&lt;ref&gt;[[Livy]], ''[[Ab Urbe Condita Libri (Livy)|Ab urbe condita]]'', [http://www.gutenberg.org/files/19725/19725-h/19725-h.htm#a33 1:33]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Artistic representations==
Many treatments of the incident combined a suitably inspiring example of the hardiness and courage of ancient Romans with the opportunity to depict multiple figures, including heroically semi-[[Nude (art)|nude figures]], in intensely passionate struggle.

[[File:Johann Heinrich Schönfeld 004.jpg|thumb|''The Rape of the Sabine Women'' by [[Johann Heinrich Schönfeld]]]]

The subject was popular during the Renaissance as symbolising the importance of marriage for the continuity of families and cultures. It was also an example of a battle subject in which the artist could demonstrate his skill in depicting female as well as male figures in extreme poses, with the added advantage of a sexual theme.  It was depicted regularly on 15th-century Italian ''[[cassone|cassoni]]'' and later in larger paintings. A comparable opportunity from the [[New Testament]] was afforded by the theme of the [[Massacre of the Innocents]].

=== [[Edgar Degas]] ===

"The masters must be copied over and over again," Degas said, "and it is only after proving yourself a good copyist that you should reasonably be permitted to draw a radish from nature." Degas first received permission to copy paintings at the Louvre in 1853 when he was eighteen. He was most interested in the great works of the Italian Renaissance and of his own classical French heritage, hence this detailed copy of Poussin's painting.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.nortonsimon.org/collections/browse_title.php?id=F.1983.06.P|title=The Rape of the Sabines (after Poussin) - Browse by Title - Norton Simon Museum|website=www.nortonsimon.org|access-date=2016-03-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Giambologna===
[[File:Florence Rape of the Sabine Women 3.jpg|thumb|''The Rape of the Sabine Women'' by [[Giambologna]] at the [[Loggia dei Lanzi]]]]
16th-century Italo-Flemish sculptor [[Giambologna]] sculpted a representation of this theme with three figures (a man lifting a woman into the air while a second man crouches), carved from a single block of [[marble]]. This sculpture is considered Giambologna's masterpiece&lt;ref&gt;Liam E. Semler, ''The English Mannerist Poets and the Visual Arts'' 1998, {{ISBN|978-0-8386-3759-3}}, page 34.&lt;/ref&gt; Originally intended as nothing more than a demonstration of the artist's ability to create a complex sculptural group, its subject matter, the legendary rape of the Sabines, had to be invented after [[Francesco I de' Medici, Grand Duke of Tuscany]], decreed that it be put on public display in the [[Loggia dei Lanzi]] in [[Piazza della Signoria]], Florence.

The proposed site for the sculpture, opposite [[Benvenuto Cellini]]'s statue of [[Perseus]], prompted suggestions that the group should illustrate a theme related to the former work, such as the rape of [[Andromeda (mythology)|Andromeda]] by [[Phineus (son of Belus)|Phineus]]. The respective rapes of [[Proserpina]] and [[Helen of Troy|Helen]] were also mooted as possible themes. It was eventually decided that the sculpture was to be identified as one of the Sabine virgins.

The work is signed &lt;small&gt;OPVS IOANNIS BOLONII FLANDRI MDLXXXII&lt;/small&gt; ("The work of Johannes of Boulogne of [[Flanders]], 1582"). An early preparatory [[bronze]] featuring only two figures is in the [[Museo Nazionale di Capodimonte]] in [[Naples]]. Giambologna then revised the scheme, this time with a third figure, in two wax models now in the [[Victoria and Albert Museum]], London. The artist's full-scale [[gesso]] for the finished sculpture, executed in 1582, is on display at the [[Galleria dell'Accademia]] in [[Florence]].

Bronze reductions of the sculpture, produced in Giambologna's own studio and imitated by others, were a staple of connoisseurs' collections into the 19th century.

[[File:Poussin RapeSabineLouvre.jpg|thumb|''The Rape of the Sabine Women'', by Nicolas Poussin, Rome, 1637–38 ([[Louvre Museum]])]]

===Nicolas Poussin===
[[Nicolas Poussin]] produced two major versions of this subject, which enabled him to display to the full his unsurpassed antiquarian knowledge, together with his mastery of complicated relations of figures in dramatic encounter. One, now at the [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]], was executed in Rome in 1634–35. It depicts Romulus at the left giving the signal for the abduction.

The second version, of 1636–37, now at the [[Louvre Museum]], shows that, though some of the principal figures are similar, he had not exhausted the subject. The architectural setting is more developed.

===Peter Paul Rubens===
{{main|The Rape of the Sabine Women (Rubens)}}
[[Peter Paul Rubens]] painted a version of the subject about 1635–40. It is at the [[National Gallery, London]].

===Jacques-Louis David===
[[File:The Intervention of the Sabine Women.jpg|thumb|''The Intervention of the Sabine Women'' ([[1799 in art|1799]]).]]
[[Jacques-Louis David]] painted the other end of the story, when the women intervene to reconcile the warring parties. ''The Sabine Women Enforcing Peace by Running Between the Combatants'' (also known as ''[[The Intervention of the Sabine Women]]'') was completed in 1799. It is in the [[Louvre Museum]].{{citation needed|date=January 2017}}

David had worked on it from 1796, when France was at war with other European nations, after a period of civil conflict culminating in the [[Reign of Terror]] and the [[Thermidorian Reaction]], during which David himself had been imprisoned as a supporter of [[Robespierre]]. After David's estranged wife visited him in jail, he conceived the idea of telling the story, to honor his wife, with the theme being love prevailing over conflict. The painting was also seen as a plea for the people to reunite after the bloodshed of the revolution.{{citation needed|date=January 2017}}

The painting depicts Romulus's wife Hersilia — the daughter of [[Titus Tatius]], leader of the Sabines — rushing between her husband and her father and placing her babies between them. A vigorous Romulus prepares to strike a half-retreating Tatius with his spear, but hesitates. Other soldiers are already sheathing their swords.{{citation needed|date=January 2017}}

===John Leech===
[[File:Comic History of Rome p 010 The Romans walking off with the Sabine Women.jpg|thumb|[[John Leech (caricaturist)|John Leech]]'s satirical version of The Rape of the Sabine Women]]

The English 19th-century satirical painter [[John Leech (caricaturist)|John Leech]] included in his ''Comic History of Rome'' a depiction of the Rape of the Sabine Women, where the women are portrayed, with a deliberate anachronism, in Victorian costume and being carried off from the "Corona et Ancora" ("Crown and Anchor", a common English pub sign in seafaring towns).

===Pablo Picasso===
[[Pablo Picasso]] visited this theme in his several versions of the ''Rape of the Sabine Women'' (1962–63), one of which is in the [[Museum of Fine Arts, Boston]]. These are based on David's version. These conflate the beginning and end of the story, depicting the brutish Romulus and Tatius ignoring and trampling on the exposed figure of Hersilia and her child.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.principisabini.it/glossario/zoom.php?id=23 La tomba del principe sabino — Glossario] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110102053759/http://www.principisabini.it/glossario/zoom.php?id=23 |date=2011-01-02 }}.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Charles Christian Nahl===
[[Charles Christian Nahl]] painted the subject in a trio of works entitled ''The Abduction'', ''The Captivity'', and ''The Invasion''.

==Literature and performing arts==
[[Stephen Vincent Benét]] wrote a short story called "The Sobbin' Women" that parodied the legend. Later adapted into the musical ''[[Seven Brides for Seven Brothers (film)|Seven Brides for Seven Brothers]]'', it tells the story of seven gauche but sincere backwoodsmen, one of whom gets married, encouraging the others to seek partners. After a social where they meet girls they are attracted to, they are denied the chance to pursue their courtship by the latter's menfolk. Following the Roman example, they abduct the girls. As in the original tale, the women are at first indignant but are eventually won over.

The story was parodied by Lady Carlotta, the mischief-making character in [[Saki]]'s short story "The Schartz-Metterklume Method".&lt;ref&gt;H. H. Munro (Saki), ''Beasts and Super-Beasts: Beasts'', available at [http://www.readbookonline.net/readOnLine/372/ Read book online] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090106102640/http://www.readbookonline.net/readOnLine/372/ |date=2009-01-06 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[midrash]] ''[[Sefer haYashar (midrash)|Sefer haYashar]]'' (first attested AD 1624) portrays the story as part of a war between the [[Sabines]], descended from [[Tubal]], and the Roman [[Kittim]] ([[s:Book of Jasher/Chapter 17|Jasher 17:1–15]]). A more detailed version of this narrative is found in the earlier mediaeval rabbinic work ''[[Yosippon]]''.

In 1962, a Spanish "[[sword and sandal]]" film based on the story was made, directed by [[Alberto Gout]]. Titled ''El Rapto de las Sabinas,'' the film was released in the USA under the titles ''[[The Rape of the Sabine Women (1962 film)|The Rape of the Sabine Women]]'' and ''The Shame of the Sabine Women.''

The latest adaptation is a [[The Rape of the Sabine Women (film)|video film, ''The Rape of the Sabine Women'']] without dialogue, which was produced in 2005 by [[Eve Sussman]] and the Rufus Corporation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=The Rape of the Sabine Women: Present at an Empire’s Corrupted Birth|publisher=[[New York Times]]|author=Roberta Smith|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/02/21/arts/design/21sabi.html|date=February 21, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Tom Stoppard]]'s play ''[[Rosencrantz and Guildenstern Are Dead]]'' features a group of all-male players offering to put on a performance of The Rape of the Sabine Women, to the disgust of the title characters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.shmoop.com/rosencrantz-and-guildenstern-are-dead/summary.html|title=Rosencrantz and Guildenstern Are Dead|work=Shmoop}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Scholars have cited parallels between the Rape of the Sabine Women, the [[Æsir–Vanir War]] in [[Norse mythology]], and the [[Mahabharata]] from [[Hindu mythology]], providing support for a [[Proto-Indo-European religion|Proto-Indo-European]] "war of the functions". Regarding these parallels, [[J. P. Mallory]] states:
{{quote|Basically, the parallels concern the presence of first-(magico-juridical) and second-(warrior) function representatives on the victorious side of a war that ultimately subdues and incorporates third function characters, for example, the Sabine women or the Norse Vanir. Indeed, the ''[[Iliad]]'' itself has also been examined in a similar light. The ultimate structure of the myth, then, is that the three estates of [[Proto-Indo-European society]] were fused only after a war between the first two against the third.&lt;ref name=MALLORY139&gt;Mallory (2005:139).&lt;/ref&gt;}}

'''Very-long-baseline interferometry''' ('''VLBI''') is a type of [[astronomical interferometer|astronomical interferometry]] used in [[radio astronomy]]. In VLBI a signal from an [[astronomical radio source]], such as a [[quasar]], is collected at multiple radio telescopes on Earth. The distance between the radio telescopes is then calculated using the time difference between the arrivals of the radio signal at different telescopes. This allows observations of an object that are made simultaneously by many radio telescopes to be combined, emulating a telescope with a size equal to the maximum separation between the telescopes.

Data received at each antenna in the array include arrival times from a local [[atomic clock]], such as a [[hydrogen maser]].  At a later time, the data are correlated with data from other antennas that recorded the same radio signal, to produce the resulting image.  The resolution achievable using interferometry is proportional to the observing frequency.  The VLBI technique enables the distance between telescopes to be much greater than that possible with conventional [[interferometry]], which requires antennas to be physically connected by [[coaxial cable]], [[waveguide]], [[optical fiber]], or other type of [[transmission line]]. The greater telescope separations are possible in VLBI due to the development of the [[closure phase]] imaging technique by [[Roger Clifton Jennison|Roger Jennison]] in the 1950s, allowing VLBI to produce images with superior resolution.

VLBI is best known for imaging distant cosmic radio sources, spacecraft tracking, and for applications in [[astrometry]].  However, since the VLBI technique measures the time differences between the arrival of radio waves at separate antennas, it can also be used "in reverse" to perform earth rotation studies, map movements of [[tectonic plate]]s very precisely (within millimetres), and perform other types of [[geodesy]].  Using VLBI in this manner requires large numbers of time difference measurements from distant sources (such as [[quasar]]s) observed with a global network of antennas over a period of time.

== VLBI arrays ==
There are several VLBI arrays located in [[Europe]], [[Canada]], the [[United States]], [[Russia]], [[South Korea]], [[Japan]], [[Mexico]], and [[Australia]]. The most sensitive VLBI array in the world is the [[European VLBI Network]] (EVN). This is a part-time array that brings together the largest European radiotelescopes for typically weeklong sessions, with the data being processed at the [[Joint Institute for VLBI in Europe]] (JIVE). The [[Very Long Baseline Array]] (VLBA), which uses ten dedicated, 25-meter telescopes spanning 5351 miles across the United States, is the largest VLBI array that operates all year round as both an astronomical and [[geodesy]] instrument.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nrao.edu/index.php/about/facilities/vlba |title=Archived copy |accessdate=May 30, 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120611150939/https://www.nrao.edu/index.php/about/facilities/vlba |archivedate=June 11, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The combination of the EVN and VLBA is known as [[Global VLBI]]. When one or both of these arrays are combined with space-based VLBI antennas such as [[HALCA]] or RadioAstron ([[Spektr-R]]), the resolution obtained is higher than any other astronomical instrument, capable of imaging the sky with a level of detail measured in [[microarcsecond]]s. VLBI generally benefits from the longer baselines afforded by international collaboration, with a notable early example in 1976, when radio telescopes in the United States, USSR and [[Australia]] were linked to observe [[hydroxyl-maser]] sources.&lt;ref&gt;First Global Radio Telescope, Sov. Astron., Oct 1976&lt;/ref&gt; This technique is currently being used by the [[Event Horizon Telescope]], whose goal is to observe the [[supermassive black holes]] at the centers of the [[Milky Way Galaxy]] and [[Messier 87]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Webb |first=Jonathan |url=https://www.bbc.com/news/science-environment-35258378 |title=Event horizon snapshot due in 2017 |work=BBC News |date=8 January 2016 |accessdate=2017-10-22 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

VLBI has traditionally operated by recording the signal at each telescope on [[Magnetic tape data storage|magnetic tape]]s or [[Hard disk drive|disk]]s, and shipping those to the correlation center for replay. Recently, it has become possible to connect VLBI radio telescopes in close to real-time, while still employing the local time references of the VLBI technique, in a technique known as '''e-VLBI'''. In Europe, six [[radio telescopes]] of the [[European VLBI Network| European VLBI Network (EVN)]] are now connected with Gigabit per second links via their National Research Networks and the Pan-European research network [[GEANT2]], and the first astronomical experiments using this new technique were successfully conducted in 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.jive.nl/astronomers-demonstrate-global-internet-telescope | title=Astronomers Demonstrate a Global Internet Telescope | accessdate=2011-05-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The image to the right shows the first science produced by the European VLBI Network using e-VLBI. The data from 6 telescopes were processed in real time at the European Data Processing centre at [[Joint Institute for VLBI in Europe|JIVE]]. The Netherlands Academic Research Network SURFnet provides 6 x 1 Gbit/s connectivity between JIVE and the GEANT2 network.

== Space VLBI ==

In the quest for even greater angular resolution, dedicated VLBI satellites have been placed in Earth orbit to provide greatly extended baselines. Experiments incorporating such space-borne array elements are termed Space Very Long Baseline Interferometry (SVLBI).

The first space VLBI experiment was on [[Salyut-6]] orbital station with KRT-10 ([[:ru:КРТ-10]]), a 10-meter radio telescope, which was launched in July 1978.

The first such dedicated VLBI mission was [[HALCA]], an 8-meter [[radio telescope]], which was launched in February 1997 and made observations until October 2003, but due to the small size of the dish only very strong radio sources could be observed with SVLBI arrays incorporating it.

Another space VLBI mission, [[Spektr-R|Spektr-R (or RadioAstron)]], was launched in July 2011. The Radioastron project is a radiointerferometer composed of the Spectrum-R space telescope and terrestrial radio telescopes. The orbit height of the Spectrum-R is 390 thousand km, which makes it the longest radiointerferometer to date. The resolution of the system will reach 8 microseconds of the arc.

== How VLBI works ==
[[Image:Recording data at each of the telescopes in a VLBI array.gif|thumb|350px|Recording data at each of the telescopes in a VLBI array. Extremely accurate high-frequency clocks are recorded alongside the astronomical data in order to help get the synchronization correct]]

In VLBI interferometry, the digitized antenna data are usually recorded at each of the telescopes (in the past this was done on large magnetic tapes, but nowadays it is usually done on large arrays of computer disk drives). The antenna signal is sampled with an extremely precise and stable atomic clock (usually a hydrogen [[maser]]) that is additionally locked onto a GPS time standard. Alongside the astronomical data samples, the output of this clock is recorded on the tape/disk media. The recorded media are then transported to a central location. More recent experiments have been conducted with "electronic" VLBI (e-VLBI) where the data are sent by fibre-optics (e.g., 10 Gbit/s fiber-optic paths in the European [[GEANT2]] research network) and not recorded at the telescopes, speeding up and simplifying the observing process significantly. 
Even though the data rates are very high, the data can be sent over normal Internet connections taking advantage of the fact that many of the international high speed networks have significant spare capacity at present.

At the location of the '''correlator''' the data are played back. The timing of the playback is adjusted according to the atomic clock signals on the (tapes/disk drives/fibre optic signal), and the estimated times of arrival of the radio signal at each of the telescopes. A range of playback timings over a range of nanoseconds are usually tested until the correct timing is found.

[[File:Vlbi data playback 2.gif|thumb|350px|Playing back the data from each of the telescopes in a VLBI array. Great care must be taken to synchronize the play back of the data from different telescopes. [[Atomic clock]] signals recorded with the data help in getting the timing correct.]]

Each antenna will be a different distance from the radio source, and as with the short baseline radio [[interferometer]]  the delays incurred by the extra distance to one antenna must be added artificially to the signals received at each of the other antennas. The approximate delay required can be calculated from the geometry of the problem. The tape playback is synchronized using the recorded signals from the atomic clocks as time references, as shown in the drawing on the right. If the position of the antennas is not known to sufficient accuracy or atmospheric effects are significant, fine adjustments to the delays must be made until interference fringes are detected. If the signal from antenna A is taken as the reference, inaccuracies in the delay will lead to errors &lt;math&gt;\epsilon_{B}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\epsilon_{C}&lt;/math&gt; in the phases of the signals from tapes B and C respectively (see drawing on right). As a result of these errors the phase of the complex visibility cannot be measured with a very-long-baseline interferometer.

The phase of the complex visibility depends on the symmetry of the source brightness distribution. Any brightness distribution can be written as the sum of a [[symmetric component]] and an [[anti-symmetric component]]. The symmetric component of the brightness distribution only contributes to the real part of the complex visibility, while the anti-symmetric component only contributes to the imaginary part. As the phase of each complex visibility measurement cannot be determined with a very-long-baseline interferometer the symmetry of the corresponding contribution to the source brightness distributions is not known.

[[Roger Clifton Jennison|R. C. Jennison]] developed a novel technique for obtaining information about visibility phases when delay errors are present, using an observable called the [[closure phase]]. Although his initial laboratory measurements of closure phase had been done at optical wavelengths, he foresaw greater potential for his technique in radio interferometry. In 1958 he demonstrated its effectiveness with a radio interferometer, but it only became widely used for long-baseline radio interferometry in 1974. At least three antennas are required. This method was used for the first VLBI measurements, and a modified form of this approach ("Self-Calibration") is still used today.
