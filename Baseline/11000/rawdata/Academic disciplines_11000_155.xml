[[Image:ARC Centre for Complex Systems (logo).jpg|thumb|ACCS Logo]]

The '''ARC Centre for Complex Systems (ACCS''') was established in 2004 from a consortium of Australian universities, led by the [[University of Queensland]]. The objective of ACCS was to conduct basic and applied research in the field of [[complex systems]]. It conducted research into both the science and engineering of complex systems. Funding was provided by the [[Australian Research Council]] (ARC) and the universities involved. The ACCS was funded under the ARC's [[Center of excellence|Centre of Excellence]] Scheme &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.arc.gov.au/ncgp/ce/2003_coe_funding.htm ARC Centres of Excellence Scheme 2003] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090625030916/http://www.arc.gov.au/ncgp/ce/2003_coe_funding.htm |date=25 June 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; until mid-2009, after which industry collaborations and further funding was established to continue to apply the Centre's research.

== Overview ==
[[Complex systems]] science is an emerging discipline developing new ways of investigating large, highly intricate, dynamically changing systems across diverse areas such as biology, social networks and socio-technological systems, economics and the environment. The ACCS was established to conduct world-class research on questions fundamental to understanding, designing and managing complex systems.

While complex systems research is considered basic research, with commercialisation still some time off, complex computing holds answers to real-life systems.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.theage.com.au/news/technology/making-the-pace-in-a-hot-new-year/2006/01/30/1138469633668.html Making the pace in a hot new year], Beverley Head, theAge.com.au, Technology, 1 January 2006
&lt;/ref&gt;

The ACCS provided a focus for complex systems science research in Australia, and developed strong infrastructure for modelling and analysing network-based systems, enabling the science to be applied to real-world problems.

The Centre had its headquarters at [[The University of Queensland]] in Brisbane, with nodes at [[Griffith University]] in Brisbane, [[Monash University]] in Melbourne, and [[The University of New South Wales]] campus at the [[Australian Defence Force Academy]] in Canberra.

The ACCS's research programs emphasised cross-disciplinary research, involving leading researchers from a range of disciplines including: systems and software engineering, economics, visualisation, human factors, computational mathematics and statistics, and relevant application domains including aerospace, economics, energy and biology.

== Research program ==
The goal of the ACCS's research was to develop deeper understanding of fundamental phenomena in complex systems, such as how macro-level system properties and behaviours emerge from relatively simple micro-level interactions, what mechanisms enable complex systems to self-organise, and how complex systems can be managed and controlled.

The [http://www.accs.uq.edu.au/research.html Centre's core research program] was based around a number of application areas.

=== Genetic regulatory networks=== 
Research in this program tackled fundamental questions about growth and form in cellular biology. Computational modelling was used to study how the control of development results from an interaction between each cell's genetic regulatory network and its inputs from neighbouring cells and its environment, and how the process proceeds reliably, while coping with unreliable components, perturbation, injury, and changing environments.

=== Air traffic control ===
This program applied complex systems science to the problem of improving the efficiency of air travel without compromising safety. To do this, researchers developed and used air traffic simulators to study new concepts and tools for air traffic management, and developed new approaches to assurance of system-level properties including safety and efficiency&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.theage.com.au/news/next/its-life-but-not-as-we-know-it/2005/11/28/1133026374254.html It's life, but not as we know it], Beverley Head, theAge.com.au, Technology, 29 November 2005
&lt;/ref&gt;
 
=== Evolutionary economic systems=== 
In this program, complex systems and network theory was applied to economics and business to understand how evolutionary change occurs. Multi-agent modelling and associated simulation and calibration techniques were core components of the methodology used. We investigated new ways of testing for complex patterns in high frequency data, by studying trade-by trade data in stock markets and in electricity markets and seeking 'pattern matches' in artificially generated agent-based modelling data. We investigated new ways of dealing with spatial complexity in several contexts. Also visualisation techniques, rarely used in economics, were applied in a range of data-rich contexts to better understand the architecture and complex dynamics of systems. 

=== Electricity networks and energy markets=== 
This program investigated ways of integrating technical and market aspects of power systems with price dynamics to provide key insights into planning expansion of Australia's power transmission network. It also aimed to apply modern computational modelling techniques to the interface between the physical properties of the electricity system and its economic considerations. A particular focus was placed on the impacts of the transmission network and power station operation on electricity price behaviour and its influence on infrastructure investment decisions. It also looked into the importance of customer-load impact on system and market operations.

=== Dependable computer-based systems=== 
This program was concerned with the development of modelling and analysis tools to ensure that dependability is designed into complex computer-based systems, particularly in areas such as transport, health and finance. There is a constant need for new methods and tools to enable engineers to ensure that such systems meet society's demands for dependability, safety and reliability.
One of the tools, Behavior Trees, was successfully trialled by Raytheon Australia to analyse six large defence projects.&lt;ref&gt; [http://www.raytheon.com.au/Default.aspx?x=501 Raytheon Australia supports pioneering systems research] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090915050723/http://www.raytheon.com.au/Default.aspx?x=501 |date=15 September 2009 }}, Raytheon News Release, 3 September 2008 &lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Finding a simple solution to complex systems, David Binning, [http://www.afr.com/home/The Australian Financial Review], 9 October 2008, p7 Project Management Special Report &lt;/ref&gt;

=== Complex systems theory and applications === 
In addition to the research programs described above, the ACCS included a number of projects addressing key problems for complex systems. The projects were concerned with the application of theory to solve issues in the design and operation of complex socio-technological systems, and with the development of new analysis techniques for complex systems.&lt;ref&gt; [http://www.calit2.net/newsroom/article.php?id=1483 Cyberinfrastructure expert spells out cooperation Between US and Australia], Tiffany Fox, Calit2 Newsroom Web article, 5 March 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <format>text/x-wiki</format>
      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="15732">In [[behavioral ecology]], '''adaptive behavior''' is any [[behavior]] that contributes directly or indirectly to an individual's [[reproductive success]], and is thus subject to the forces of [[natural selection]].&lt;ref name="Starr"&gt;Ecology and Behavior ''from'' Biology: The Unity and Diversity of Life 10th edition. Starr and Taggart 2004. Thompson publishers {{ISBN|0-534-39746-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; Examples include favoring [[Kinship|kin]] in [[altruistic behavior]]s, [[sexual selection|female selection]] of the most fit male, and defending a [[Territory (animal)|territory]] or [[Polygyny#In nature|harem]] from rivals. 

Conversely, '''non-adaptive behavior''' is any behavior that is counterproductive to an individual's survival or reproductive success. Examples might include altruistic behaviors which do not favor kin, [[adoption]] of unrelated young, and being a subordinate in a [[dominance hierarchy]].

Adaptations are commonly defined as evolved solutions to recurrent environmental problems of survival and reproduction.&lt;ref name=Buss&gt;Buss, D.M. and Greiling, H. 1999. Adaptive individual differences. Journal of Personality, 67: 209-243.&lt;/ref&gt; Individual differences commonly arise through both [[heritable]] and [[Non-heritable variations|non-heritable]] adaptive behavior. Both have been proven to be influential in the [[evolution]] of species' adaptive behaviors, although non-heritable adaptation remains a controversial subject.&lt;ref name = Buss/&gt;

==Non-heritable==
[[Population]]s change through the process of [[evolution]]. Each individual in a population has a unique role in their particular environment. This role, commonly known as an [[ecological niche]], is simply how an organism lives in an environment in relation to others.&lt;ref name=Staddon&gt;Staddon, J. E. R. (1983). ''Adaptive Behavior and Learning''. Cambridge University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Over successive generations, the organism must adapt to their surrounding conditions in order to develop their niche. An organism's niche will evolve as changes in the external environment occur. The most successful species in nature are those that are able to use adaptive behaviors to build on prior knowledge, thereby increasing their overall knowledge bank. In turn, this will improve their overall survival and reproductive success.

===Learning===
{{Main|Learning}}
Many species have the ability to adapt through [[learning]].&lt;ref name = Staddon/&gt; [[Organisms]] will often learn through various psychological and cognitive processes, such as [[operant]] and [[classical conditioning]] and discrimination memory.&lt;ref name = Staddon/&gt; This learning process allows organisms to modify their behavior to survive in unpredictable environments.&lt;ref name = Staddon/&gt; Organisms begin as naive individuals and learning allows them to obtain the knowledge they need to adapt and survive. It is important to remember that a learned adaptive behavior must have a [[psychological]], as well as a [[biological]], component; without the integration of these two disciplines, behavioral adaptation cannot occur.

====Kin selection====
{{Main|Kin selection}}
[[Kin selection]] (commonly referred to as [[altruism]]) is an example of an adaptive behavior that directly influences the genetic composition of a population. It involves evolutionary strategies that favor the persistence of an organism's relatives, often at the cost of the organism's own survival and [[reproduction]].&lt;ref name=Eberhard&gt;Eberhard, M.J.W. 1975. The evolution of social behavior by kin selection. The Quarterly Review of Biology, 50: 1-33.&lt;/ref&gt; This will result in population gene [[frequency]] variation over successive generations, based on the interactions between related individuals. The probability of altruism increases when the [[cost]] is low for the donor, or when there is a high level of gain for the beneficiary. In addition, individuals often display altruistic behaviors when the relative is genetically similar to them.&lt;ref name = Eberhard/&gt; This means offspring or siblings are more likely to benefit from altruism than someone more distantly related, such as a cousin, aunt, or uncle.&lt;ref&gt;Smith, J.M. 1964. Group selection and kin selection. Nature, 201: 1145-1147.&lt;/ref&gt;
Kin selection has played a large role in the evolution of social and adaptive behaviors in chimpanzees. Closely related chimpanzees will form a kin group that cooperates to protect a territory, thereby increasing their access to females and resources.&lt;ref name=Morin&gt;Morin, P.A., Moore, J.J., Chakraborty, R., Jin, L., Goodall, J. and Woodruff, D.S. Kin selection, social structure, gene flow, and the evolution of chimpanzees. Science, 265: 1193-1201.&lt;/ref&gt; By working together with close relatives, they can ensure that their genes will persist in the next generation, even if circumstances make them unable to reproduce themselves.&lt;ref name = Morin/&gt; This behavioral adaptation coincides with chimpanzee's ability to distinguish kin from non-kin (referred to as visual kin selection) allowing chimps to formulate large, complex societies, where they use altruistic methods to ensure their genes persist in future generations&lt;ref&gt;Parr, L.A. and de Waal, F.B.M. Visual kin recognition in chimpanzees.  Nature, 399: 647-648.&lt;/ref&gt;. A wide variety of species, including lions, honeybees, and insects have displayed kin selection as an adaptive behavior &lt;ref&gt;Bertram, B.C.R. (1976). ''Growing Points in Ethology. Cambridge University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Peters, J.M., Queller, D.C., Imperatriz-Fonseca, V.L., Roubik, D.W. and Strassmann, J.E. 1999. Mate number, kin selection and social conflicts in stingless bees and honeybees. Proceedings of the Royal Society B, 266: 379-384.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Queller, D.C. and Strassmann, J.E. 1998. Kin selection and social insects. Bioscience, 48: 165-175.&lt;/ref&gt;.

====Territorial defense====
As mentioned above, chimpanzees work together with closely related kin to protect their [[Territory (animal)|territory]].&lt;ref&gt;Krebs, J.R. 1980. Optimal foraging, predation risk and territory defence. Ardea, 68: 83-90.&lt;/ref&gt; Defending territory from rivals (known as territoriality) is a learnt adaptive behavior performed by several ecological species. The advantage of being territorial varies depending on the species of interest, but the underlying principle is always to increase overall fitness.&lt;ref&gt;Gese, E.M. 2001. Territorial defense by coyotes (Canis latrans) in Yellowstone National Park, Wyoming: who, how, where, when, and why. Canadian Journal of Zoology, 79: 980-987.&lt;/ref&gt; Many species will display territoriality in order to acquire food, compete for mates, or have the safest lair. Bird song is an example of learned territorial defense. Studies show that birds with high-quality songs will use them as a stimulus to deter predators from their territorial range.&lt;ref&gt;De Kort, S.R., Eldermire, E.L.B., Cramer, E.R.A. and Vehrencamp, S.L. (2009). The deterrent effect of birdsong in territory defense. Behavioral Ecology, 20: 200-206.&lt;/ref&gt; Higher quality songs have been proven to act as the best defense mechanism in a variety of bird species, such as the red-winged blackbird (''Agelaius phoeniceus'').&lt;ref&gt;Yasukawa, K. 1981. Song and territory defense in the red-winged blackbird. The Auk, 98: 185-187.&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, correct learning of the birdsong early in life is necessary for territory defense in birds. 
European beavers (''Castor fiber'') are another species that use territory defense. They are very protective of their territory because they spend a great deal of time and energy familiarizing themselves with the location and building a habitat. Beavers are unique because they have developed the technique of scent-marking as a way to intimidate intruders.&lt;ref&gt;Rosell, F. and Nolet, B.A. 1997. Factors affecting scent-marking behavior in Eurasian beaver ('''Castor fiber'''). Journal of Chemical Ecology, 3: 673-689.&lt;/ref&gt; This scent acts as a "psychological fence", thereby decreasing the possibility of injury or death by predation. 

===Controversy===
There is debate on whether or not there exists a biological component associated with the learning process in ecological adaptive behavior. Many researchers suggest that the biological and psychological disciplines are integrated, while others believe that the non-heritable component is strictly psychological. They argue that non-heritable traits cannot evolve over successive generations.&lt;ref&gt;Kohn, D. 1976. Two concepts of adaption: Darwin's and psychology's. Journal of History of the Behavioral Sciences, 12: 367-375.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Heritable==
[[File:Northern Elephant Seal, San Simeon.jpg|right|thumb|200px|Male [[northern elephant seal]]s will fight to defend their [[Polygyny#In nature|harem]]s from rival males, note the pink scarring on the neck of the dominant male.]]
Organisms can also express [[heritable]] adaptive behaviors. These behaviors are encoded in their [[genes]] and inherited from their parents. This gives the organisms the ability to respond to situations with their innate response mechanisms. Using these mechanisms, they can respond appropriately to their internal and external environment without having to learn.&lt;ref name = Staddon/&gt;

===Natural selection===
{{main|Natural selection}}
Heritable adaptive behavior evolves through [[natural selection]]. In this case, some genes better equip individuals to respond to environmental or physiological cues, thereby increasing reproductive success and causing these genes to persist in future generations. Non-adaptive behaviors cause a decrease in reproductive success so the genes are lost from future generations.&lt;ref name = Staddon/&gt;  These adaptive and non-adaptive characteristics arise through [[random mutation]], [[Genetic recombination|recombination]], and/or [[genetic drift]].&lt;ref name = Buss/&gt; Essentially, natural selection is a mechanism that contributes to directional gene selection in individuals that reproduce. Traits that cause greater reproductive success of an organism are favored, whereas those that reduce reproductive success are selected against.&lt;ref&gt;Lande, R. and Arnold, S.J. 1983. The measurement of selection on correlated characters. Evolution, 37: 1210-26.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Haldane, J.B.S. 1953. The measurement of natural selection. Genetics, 1: 480-487.&lt;/ref&gt;

In contrast to learning, natural selection is solely a biological concept. It is the biological and genetic component that allows an adaptive behavior to be inherited with no connection to the environment. This form of adaptive behavior is most commonly considered in [[ecological studies]], and therefore natural selection is often used to explain ecological adaptive behavior in organisms.

====Sexual selection====
While kin selection is non-heritable and a direct result of the environment, sexual selection is a heritable adaptive behavior, and can therefore can be acted upon by natural selection. Sexual selection refers specifically to competition for mates.&lt;ref name = Andersson&gt;Andersson, M. (1995). Sexual Selection. Princeton, New Jersey: Princeton University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Many traits or features that are characteristic of a certain species can be explained by sexual selection as an adaptive behavior; this is because competition for mates results in specific traits being inherited.&lt;ref name = Andersson/&gt; Only the species that are able to successfully compete and obtain a mate will reproduce and pass their genes on to the next generation. Therefore, species-specific genetic traits must be inherited, allowing individuals to be successful in their designated environments. There are many environmental examples of sexual selection as an adaptive behavior; one popular example is [[Sexual dimorphism in non-human primates|sexual dimorphism]]. Sexual dimorphism is a morphological, phenotypic difference between males and females same species.&lt;ref name = Barlow&gt;Barlow, G.W. 2005. How do we decide that a species is sex-role reversed?. The Quarterly Review of Biology, 80: 28-35.&lt;/ref&gt;  A common example of sexual dimorphism is difference in body size.&lt;ref name = Barlow/&gt; Sexual dimorphism can specifically be seen in the fish species, [[Lamprologus callipterus]].&lt;ref name = Kazutaka&gt;Kazutaka, O., Masanori, K. and Tetsu, S. 2010. Unusual allometry for sexual size dimorphism in a cichlid where males are extremely larger than females. Journal of Biosciences, 35: 257-265.&lt;/ref&gt; These male fish are substantially larger (sometimes up to 60 times) than their female counterparts.&lt;ref name = Kazutaka/&gt; The male's increased size is advantageous because the larger individual's are able to compete for females, and subsequently defend their offspring, which grow inside empty snail shells until birth.&lt;ref name = Kazutaka/&gt; Basically, the larger the male fish, the greater the adaptive benefit. The advantage of being larger and more powerful is demonstrated in the male's ability to compete and protect. In contrast to the males, the female fish must remain small in order to lay eggs inside the snail shells.&lt;ref name = Kazutaka/&gt; It is evident that size plays a significant role in the reproductive success of this particular fish species.&lt;ref&gt;McCormick, M.I., Ryen, C.A., Munday, P.L., and Walker, S.P.W. 2010. Differing mechanisms underlie sexual size-dimorphism in two populations of a sex-changing fish. PLoS One, 5: e10616.&lt;/ref&gt; Large size is a common adaptive behavioral trait that is inherited through sexual selection and reproduction, as demonstrated in Lamprologus callipterus and other sexually dimorphic species.

==Importance==
It has been proven that adaptive behavior is crucial in the process of [[natural selection]], and thus is important in the [[evolutionary process]]. Species that possess positive adaptive behaviors will inherently acquire evolutionary advantages. For example, adaptive behavior is a mechanism of [[population stabilization]].&lt;ref name = Val&gt;Valdovinos, F.S., Ramos-Jiliberto, R., Garay-Narvaez, L., Urbani, P. and Dunne, J.A. 2010. Consequences of adaptive behavior for the structure and dynamic of food webs. Ecology Letters, 13: 1546-1559.&lt;/ref&gt; In natural communities, organisms are able to interact with each other creating complex [[food webs]] and [[predator-prey dynamics]]. Adaptive behavior helps modulate the dynamics of feeding relationships by having a direct effect on their feeding [[Phenotypic trait|trait]]s and strategies.&lt;ref name = Val/&gt; These adaptive behaviors allow for resilience and resistance in the face of [[disturbance (ecology)|disturbance]]s and a changing environment.&lt;ref name = Val/&gt; In [[ecology]], the coexistence of [[organisms]] in natural ecosystems and the stability of populations are central topics. Currently, we live in a world experiencing great changes at a fast rate, mostly due to [[Human impact on the environment|anthropogenic]] impacts on organisms and the environment.&lt;ref name = Val/&gt; By studying adaptive behavior one can understand [[ecosystem]] complexity – how it emerges, how it evolves, and how it can be maintained.

==Measurement==
An organism's behavioral strategies and ability to [[Adaptation|adapt]] will determine how they respond under different environmental conditions. Fitness is a common measure of adaptive success, and can be defined as the number of [[Lineal descendant|descendant]]s left over after a group exhibits a particular behavioral strategy.&lt;ref&gt;Houston, A. and McNamara, J.M. (1999) Models of Adaptive Behavior. Cambridge University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Successful strategies will result in increased survival and [[reproduction]], which in turn can be characterized as a profitable behavioral adaption.

{{BibleHistory}}
The '''Anchor Bible project''', consisting of a commentary series, Bible dictionary, and reference library, is a [[scholarly]] and [[Commerce|commercial]] co-venture begun in 1956, when individual volumes in the [[List of biblical commentaries|commentary]] series began production. Having initiated a new era of cooperation among scholars in biblical research, over 1,000 scholars—representing [[Jewish]], [[Catholic]], [[Eastern Orthodox]], [[Protestant]], [[Muslim]], [[secular]], and other traditions—have now contributed to the project. Their works offer discussions that reflect a range of viewpoints across a wide [[theological]] spectrum. The Anchor Bible project continues to produce volumes that keep readers current on recent scholarship and are grounded in analysis. The works bring advances in science and technology to bear on biblical materials, making [[historical criticism|historical]] and [[textual criticism|linguistic knowledge]] related to the interpretation of the biblical record available to experts and students alike. As of 2005, more than 120 volumes had been published, each edited by [[David Noel Freedman]], General Editor and published by Doubleday (part of Random House, Inc.), Freedman died in 2008. Since then [[John J. Collins]] has served as the General Editor. In 2007, [[Yale University Press]] purchased the '''Anchor Bible Series'''. Yale now publishes backlist titles and new titles as the '''Anchor Yale Bible Series'''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://blog.yupnet.org/2007/09/25/breaking-news-y/ "Yale University Press Acquires Anchor Bible Series from Doubleday"], Yale University Press, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://yalepress.yale.edu/yupbooks/SeriesPage.asp?Series=143 "The Anchor Yale Bible Series"], Yale University Press, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

==''Anchor Bible Commentary Series''==
The ''Anchor Bible Commentary Series'', created under the guidance of [[William Foxwell Albright]] (1891–1971), comprises a translation and [[exegesis]] of the [[Hebrew Bible]], the [[New Testament]] and the Intertestamental Books (the [[Catholic]] and [[Eastern Orthodox]] [[Deuterocanon]]/the Protestant [[Apocrypha]]; not the books called by Catholics and Orthodox "Apocrypha", which are widely called by Protestants "[[Pseudepigrapha]]"). For each biblical book, the series includes an original translation (with annotations, including alternative translations) of ancient texts, using modern knowledge of the ancient languages; overviews of the historical, critical, and literary evolution of the text; an outline of major themes and topics; a verse-by-verse commentary; treatment of competing scholarly theories; historical background; and photographs, illustrations, and maps of artifacts and places associated with biblical figures and sites. Lengthy or complex biblical books are covered in more than one volume.

A work in progress, as of 2006, the series has produced over 80 volumes, some of which are updates of earlier works. The series is 99% complete; the second half of [[Book of Exodus|Exodus]] was released in early December 2006, and the remaining volumes are in production. Others such as II Chronicles and Revelation are under contract.

It has illustrations and line-art throughout, and is also available for download from [[Logos Bible Software]] or [[Accordance]] Bible Software. The "Dictionary" includes articles on the [[Dead Sea Scrolls]], early Jewish-Christian relations, the historical Jesus, sociological and literary methods of biblical criticism, feminist hermeneutics, and numerous entries on archaeological sites, as well as bibliographies with citations listed individually at the end of each article.

==''Anchor Bible Reference Library''==

The ''Anchor Bible Reference Library'' is an open-ended series composed of more than thirty separate volumes with information about anthropology, archaeology, ecology, geography, history, languages, literature, philosophy, religions, and theology, among others.

A '''cell survival curve''' is a curve used in [[radiobiology]]. It depicts the relationship between the fraction of [[Cell (biology)|cells]] retaining their reproductive integrity and the [[absorbed dose]] of radiation.  Conventionally, the surviving fraction is depicted on a [[logarithmic scale]], and is plotted on the y-axis against dose on the x-axis.

The [[Radiation-induced_cancer|linear quadratic model]] is now most often used to describe the cell survival curve, assuming that there are two mechanisms to cell death by radiation: A single lethal event or an accumulation of harmful but non-lethal events. Cell survival fractions are exponential functions with a dose-dependent term in the exponent due to the [[Poisson_distribution|Poisson statistics]] underlying the [[stochastic process]]. Whereas single lethal events lead to an exponent that is linearly related to dose, the survival fraction function for a two-stage mechanism carries an exponent proportional to the square of dose. The coefficients must be inferred from measured data, such as the Hiroshima Leukemia data. With higher orders being of lesser importance and the total survival fraction being the product of the two functions, the model is aptly called linear-quadratic.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="16682">In keeping with the [[Paris Principles]] definition of a child soldier, the Roméo Dallaire Child Soldiers Initiative defines a ''child pirate''' as any person below 18 years of age who is or who has been recruited or used by a [[pirate]] gang in any capacity, including children - boys and/or girls - used as gunmen in boarding parties, hostage guards, negotiators, ship captains, messengers, spies or for sexual purposes, whether at sea or on land.  It does not only refer to a child who is taking or has taken a direct part in kinetic criminal operations.

Children may volunteer to participate in piratical activities (usually on account of socioeconomic desperation, familial suggestion or peer influence) or they may be forcibly abducted by piratical gangs.

== Causes  ==

There are a number of reasons why an adult pirate commander would view children as being of significant tactical value.  These perceptions render children vulnerable to abduction or forced recruitment.  As noted by Carl Conradi:

:"Like warlords, pirate commanders recruit children because they are vulnerable and easily manipulated; fearless and ignorant of the long-term consequences of their actions; inexpensive to maintain; plentiful in developing countries most afflicted by piracy; small in stature and therefore nimble; easily indoctrinated; largely invulnerable to legal proceedings; and because they pose a moral challenge to their enemies."&lt;ref name="navalreview"&gt;http://www.navalreview.ca/2013/02/the-invisible-phenomenon-of-child-piracy/&lt;/ref&gt;”

In other cases, children may volunteer to participate in piratical activities.  However, as asserted by the Canada-based [[Roméo Dallaire]] Child Soldiers Initiative, "'voluntary' enlistment must be understood in terms of the limited choices and circumstances that may exist in the context of a particular country."&lt;ref name="childsoldiers"&gt;http://www.childsoldiers.org/files/publications/2012-DMPP-Children-Youth-Marine-Piracy.pdf{{dead link|date=November 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;’  If a child is extremely poor, has been displaced from his or her home, has been separated from his or her family, has limited educational opportunities or has been exposed to conflict, there is an increased likelihood that he or she will view piracy as a legitimate vehicle for social advancement.

== National and international mechanisms and laws ==

In the absence of specific international legislation on juvenile maritime piracy, the precise age of a child’s criminal responsibility when committing piratical acts differs from country to country.  There are, however, a number of international conventions pertaining to either maritime law or children’s rights that may provide some guidance as to the proper handling of child pirates.

=== United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea  ===

While the [[United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea]] (UNCLOS, 1982) does not discuss children’s involvement in maritime criminal activities, it does provide a clear definition of piracy.  According to Article 101, piracy is:

:a) any illegal acts of violence or detention, or any act of depredation, committed for private ends by the crew or passengers of a private ship or a private aircraft, and directed:
:::i. on the high seas, against another ship or aircraft, or against persons or property on board such ship or aircraft;
:::ii. against a ship, aircraft, persons or property in a place outside the jurisdiction of any State;
:b) any act of voluntary participation in the operation of a ship or of an aircraft with knowledge of facts making it a pirate ship or aircraft;
:c) any act of inciting or intentionally facilitating an act described in subparagraph (a) or (b).&lt;ref&gt;https://www.un.org/depts/los/convention_agreements/texts/unclos/part7.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

UNCLOS does recognise universal jurisdiction over the crime of piracy but it only applies to criminal acts that take place on international waters.  If an act of piracy occurs within a country’s territorial waters, it is a matter of state jurisdiction and prosecution.

=== International Labour Organisation Worst Forms of Child Labour Convention ===

Article 3 of the International Labour Organisation’s (ILO) [[Worst Forms of Child Labour Convention]] (No. 182, 1999) stipulates that:

:…the term the worst forms of child labour comprises:

:a) all forms of [[slavery]] or practices similar to slavery, such as the sale and [[trafficking of children]], [[debt bondage]] and [[serfdom]] and forced or [[Unfree labour|compulsory labour]], including forced or compulsory [[Military use of children|recruitment of children for use in armed conflict]];
:b) the use, procuring or offering of a child for [[Prostitution of children|prostitution]], for the production of pornography or for pornographic performances;
:c) the use, procuring or offering of a child for illicit activities, in particular for the production and trafficking of drugs defined in the relevant international treaties;
:d) work which, by its nature or the circumstances in which it is carried out, is likely to harm the health, safety or morals of children.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ilo.org/dyn/normlex/en/f?p=1000:12100:0::NO::P12100_ILO_CODE:C182&lt;/ref&gt;

Insofar as participation in any form of maritime criminality is dangerous (and indeed, potentially lethal), child piracy clearly constitutes a worst form of child labour.

According to the Convention, a child is any person who is below the age of 18.

As of April 2013, eight countries had not signed ILO Convention No. 182.  These include Cuba, Eritrea, India, the Marshall Islands, Myanmar, Palau, Somalia and Tuvalu.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ilo.org/dyn/normlex/en/f?p=NORMLEXPUB:11310:0::NO:11310:P11310_INSTRUMENT_ID:312327:NO&lt;/ref&gt;  Two of these countries – India and Somalia – are currently detaining and prosecuting alleged child pirates.

=== United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child ===

Like ILO Convention No. 182, Article 1 of the United Nations [[Convention on the Rights of the Child]]&lt;ref&gt;http://www.unicef-irc.org/portfolios/crc.html&lt;/ref&gt; (1990) specifies that a child is any human being below the age of 18 years.  However, the same article adds a caveat to the effect that a country’s minimum age of criminal responsibility may be lower than 18, as stipulated by national law.

Other sections that may have some bearing upon the status of child pirates include Article 6, in which, “States Parties recognize that every child has the inherent right to life,” and that, “States Parties shall ensure to the maximum extent possible the survival and development of the child.”

Article 19(1) affirms that, “States Parties shall take all appropriate legislative, administrative, social and educational measures to protect the child from all forms of physical or mental violence, injury or abuse, neglect or negligent treatment, maltreatment or exploitation, including sexual abuse, while in the care of parent(s), legal guardian(s) or any other person who has the care of the child.”  This clause may be particularly relevant in cases where a child’s parents have forced him or her to participate in piratical activity, or where the State is responsible for detaining, interrogating, trying and/or incarcerating a captured child pirate.

Article 32(1) echoes ILO Convention No. 182 by stipulating that, “States Parties recognize the right of the child to be protected from economic exploitation and from performing any work that is likely to be hazardous or to interfere with the child’s education, or to be harmful to the child’s health or physical, mental, spiritual, moral or social development.”

Article 35 says that, “State Parties shall take all appropriate national, bilateral and multilateral measures to prevent the abduction of, the sale of or traffic in children for any purpose or in any form.”  When a piratical gang permanently separates a child from his or her family, this may constitute an act of child trafficking.

Article 37(a) affirms that, “No child shall be subjected to torture or other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment.  Neither capital punishment nor life imprisonment without possibility of release shall be imposed for offences committed by persons below eighteen years of age.”  Likewise, Article 37(c) states that, “Every child deprived of liberty shall be treated with humanity and respect for the inherent dignity of the human person, and in a manner which takes into account the needs of persons of his or her age.  In particular, every child deprived of liberty shall be separated from adults unless it is considered in the child’s best interests not to do so and shall have the right to maintain contact with his or her family through correspondence and visits, save in exceptional circumstances.”

Lastly, Article 39 stipulates that, “State Parties shall take all appropriate measures to promote physical and psychological recovery and social reintegration of a child victim of: any form of neglect, exploitation or abuse; torture or any other form of cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment; or armed conflicts.  Such recovery and reintegration shall take place in an environment which fosters the health, self-respect and dignity of the child.”

=== Other regional mechanisms and conventions ===

The third version of the ''Best Management Practices to Deter Piracy off the Coast of Somalia and in the Arabian Sea Area&lt;ref&gt;http://www.secure-marine.com/bmp3/bpm3_pdf.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;'' (June 2010) recommends a sample follow-up report that should be filled by the captain of any vessel that has come under pirate attack.  While the report does solicit certain details concerning the offending raiding party – such as the number of constituent pirate members, their physical appearance and the weapons that were used – it does not ask for the estimated ages of pirates.

The [[Regional Cooperation Agreement on Combating Piracy and Armed Robbery against Ships in Asia]] (ReCAAP) is a multilateral pact that facilitates information sharing between signatory countries.  The reporting mechanism that it establishes does not specifically call for the collection of disaggregated data pertaining to the ages of captured pirates.

According to the UN Office on Drugs and Crime, the UN [[Contact Group on Piracy off the Coast of Somalia]] is in the midst of drafting an apprehension and transfer protocol for juvenile pirates who are captured by international navies operating in the Horn of Africa region.

=== National laws and judicial mechanisms ===

All three of the main Somali sub-regions (i.e., [[Somalia|South-Central]], [[Puntland]] and [[Somaliland]]) have signed memoranda of understanding (MoUs) with the governments of Mauritius and the Seychelles, allowing for the transfer of convicted pirates to prison facilities in Somalia.  These MoUs, however, do not specify clear standard operating procedures for processing and/or transferring pirates who are determined to be under the age of 18.  Kenya is also trying suspected Somali pirates but no prisoner transfer agreement is currently in place.

According to UNICEF-Somalia, some 100 child pirates are currently being detained in a prison in [[Bosaso]], Puntland.  A second prison for juvenile pirates with a capacity of 100 is being built in [[Garoowe]], while a 70-person prison for juvenile pirates is being built in Somaliland.

The Republic of Somaliland’s Juvenile Justice Law (2007) raised the age of criminal responsibility for 14 to 15 years and established separate judicial mechanisms for minors, such as child-specific courts of first instance and appellate courts.  However, Somaliland’s Law on Combating Piracy (2012) does not make any specific reference to persons under the age of 18.

The Somali sub-region of Puntland does not have any specific legislation pertaining to child protection, though as of April 2013, a policy on orphans and other vulnerable children had been tabled in Parliament.

India’s Piracy Bill (2012) does not make any specific reference to persons under the age of 18.

== Incidences ==

=== Nigeria ===

According to the Roméo Dallaire Child Soldiers Initiative:

:"In Nigeria, young unemployed men, in particular, are frequently enticed into the organized pirate gangs operating in the Delta region by “…promised riches, fancy cars, luxury goods and weapons,” such that these gangs are increasingly composed of younger members.  It has also become recognized that in Nigeria, social mobility and the struggle for survival now necessitate the use of violence as “…society gradually stopped recognizing merit and force became a plausible avenue to the top of social and economic strata with drug trafficking, smuggling and other perceived moneymaking ventures like armed robbery, seen as ways to get rich quickly."&lt;ref name="childsoldiers" /&gt;”’

=== Somalia ===

One of the most egregious instances of child maritime piracy off the coast of Somalia is recounted on the Canadian Naval Review’s Broadsides forum:

:"In March 2011, Indian naval forces operating in the Arabian Sea captured the Mozambique-flagged fishing vessel ''Vega 5''.  Somali pirates had kidnapped the trawler’s original crew several months earlier.  They subsequently refurbished the stolen craft into an operationally significant "mothership".  Of the 61 marauders who were arrested during the Indian raid, an astonishing 25 persons – or some 40% of the entire crew – were determined to be under the age of 15.  Indeed, ensuring reports revealed that four of the pirates could not have been older than 11."&lt;ref name="navalreview" /&gt;'

The ''Vega 5'' hijacking does not appear to be an isolated incident.  The Broadsides article continues to report that:

:"During a recent visit to the autonomous Somali region of Puntland, former UN Special Representative for Children and Armed Conflict, Ms. [[Radhika Coomaraswamy]], was told by a jailed adult pirate that his colleagues and superiors were increasingly reliant upon child recruits when attempting seize ships for ransom.  Many of the adults who are responsible for directing piracy operations only do so from their homes on land, rather than from motherships on the high seas.  As such, according to Ms. Coomaraswamy, the individuals actually sent out to, "…do the dangerous stuff are the young children, between the ages of 15, 16 and 17."&lt;ref&gt;http://www.arabnews.com/node/360064&lt;/ref&gt;"'

The Roméo Dallaire Child Soldiers Initiative has determined that a significant proportion of those Somali pirates who are currently being tried internationally are actually under the age of 18.  In India, 38 out of 61 pirates (62%) facing trial are juveniles; in Germany, 3 out of 10 (30%) are children; and in the United States of America, all three Somali pirates currently facing trial are under the age of 18.&lt;ref name="childsoldiers" /&gt;

=== Sri Lanka ===

The Roméo Dallaire Child Soldiers Initiative has noted that:&lt;ref name="childsoldiers" /&gt;

:"As part of its military strategy, the [[LTTE]] [Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam] maintained “…the most comprehensive naval networks among the [US-designated] foreign terrorist organizations&lt;ref name="asiantribune"&gt;http://www.asiantribune.com/?q=node/16950&lt;/ref&gt;…”.  This branch of operations, called the [[Sea Tigers]], launched a multitude of attacks upon international cargo ships, including several – such as the Greek-registered freighter ''Stillus Limassul'' – that were carrying weapons to be used by the Sri Lankan military.&lt;ref name="asiantribune" /&gt;  Like its army, the LTTE’s naval branch actively recruited and deployed child soldiers.  Indeed, there is evidence that during periods of LTTE-sponsored disarmament of child soldiers, underage members of the Sea Tigers were surreptitiously retained, as they had frequently received resource-intensive training that made them particularly strong military assets."&lt;ref&gt;Hogg, C. L. (2006). ''Child Recruitment in South Asian Conflicts''. Chatham House (The Royal Institute of International Affairs): UK.&lt;/ref&gt;  It was also very common for “…very young Tamils (some as young as 13) [to be] pressed into service to fill the [naval] ranks as the long-running insurgency depleted LTTE manpower.&lt;ref&gt;Povlock, P. A. (2011, September 9). 'A Guerilla War at Sea: The Sri Lankan Civil War'. ''Small Wars Journal''. Retrieved from http://smallwarsjournal.com/jrnl/art/a-guerilla-war- at-sea-the-sri-lankan-civil-war.&lt;/ref&gt;”'

[[Image:Zuev.jpg|thumb|[[Zuev Workers' Club]], 1927-1929.]]
'''Constructivism''' was an [[art]]istic and [[architecture|architectural]] philosophy that originated in [[Russia]] beginning in 1913 by [[Vladimir Tatlin]]. This was a rejection of the idea of autonomous art. He wanted 'to construct' art. The movement was in favour of art as a practice for social purposes. Constructivism had a great effect on modern art movements of the 20th century, influencing major trends such as the [[Bauhaus]] and [[De Stijl]] movements. Its influence was widespread, with major effects upon architecture, [[sculpture]], [[graphic design]], [[industrial design]], theatre, film, dance, fashion and to some extent music.

==Beginnings==

The term ''Construction Art'' was first used as a derisive term by [[Kazimir Malevich]] to describe the work of [[Alexander Rodchenko]] in 1917.{{Citation needed|date=May 2009}}  Constructivism first appears as a positive term in [[Naum Gabo]]'s ''[[Realistic Manifesto]]'' of 1920. [[Aleksei Gan]] used the word as the title of his book ''Constructivism'', printed in 1922.&lt;ref&gt;Catherine Cooke, ''Russian Avant-Garde: Theories of Art, Architecture and the City'', Academy Editions, 1995, page 106.&lt;/ref&gt; Constructivism was a post-World War I development of [[Russian Futurism]], and particularly of the 'counter reliefs' of [[Vladimir Tatlin]], which had been exhibited in 1915. The term itself would be invented by the sculptors [[Antoine Pevsner]] and [[Naum Gabo]], who developed an industrial, angular style of work, while its geometric abstraction owed something to the [[Suprematism]] of Kazimir Malevich.

Constructivism as theory and practice was derived largely from a series of debates at the Institute of Artistic Culture ([[INKhUK]]) in Moscow, from 1920 to 1922. After deposing its first chairman, [[Wassily Kandinsky]], for his 'mysticism', The First Working Group of Constructivists (including [[Liubov Popova]], [[Alexander Vesnin]], [[Rodchenko]], [[Varvara Stepanova]], and the theorists [[Aleksei Gan]], [[Boris Arvatov]] and [[Osip Brik]]) would develop a definition of Constructivism as the combination of ''[[faktura]]'': the particular material properties of an object, and ''tektonika'', its spatial presence. Initially the Constructivists worked on three-dimensional constructions as a means of participating in industry: the OBMOKhU (Society of Young Artists) exhibition showed these three dimensional compositions, by Rodchenko, Stepanova, [[Karl Ioganson]] and the [[Stenberg brothers]]. Later the definition would be extended to designs for two-dimensional works such as books or posters, with ''montage'' and ''factography'' becoming important concepts.

==Art in the service of the Revolution==
[[Image:Plakat mayakowski gross.jpg|thumb|right|Agitprop poster by Mayakovsky]] 
As much as involving itself in designs for industry, the Constructivists worked on public festivals and street designs for the post-October revolution Bolshevik government. Perhaps the most famous of these was in [[Vitebsk]], where Malevich's [[UNOVIS]] Group painted propaganda plaques and buildings (the best known being [[El Lissitzky]]'s poster ''[[Beat the Whites with the Red Wedge]]'' (1919)). Inspired by [[Vladimir Mayakovsky]]'s declaration 'the streets our brushes, the squares our palettes', artists and designers participated in public life during the Civil War. A striking instance was the proposed festival for the [[Comintern]] congress in 1921 by Alexander Vesnin and Liubov Popova, which resembled the constructions of the OBMOKhU exhibition as well as their work for the theatre. There was a great deal of overlap during this period between Constructivism and [[Proletkult]], the ideas of which concerning the need to create an entirely new culture struck a chord with the Constructivists. In addition some Constructivists were heavily involved in the 'ROSTA Windows', a Bolshevik public information campaign of around 1920. Some of the most famous of these were by the poet-painter Vladimir Mayakovsky and Vladimir Lebedev.

The constructivists tried to create works that would make the viewer an active viewer of the artwork. In this it had similarities with the [[Russian Formalists]]' theory of 'making strange', and accordingly their main theorist [[Viktor Shklovsky]] worked closely with the Constructivists, as did other formalists like the Arch Bishop. These theories were tested in theatre, particularly with the work of [[Vsevolod Meyerhold]], who had established what he called 'October in the theatre'. Meyerhold developed a 'biomechanical' acting style, which was influenced both by the circus and by the 'scientific management' theories of [[Frederick Winslow Taylor]]. Meanwhile, the stage sets by the likes of Vesnin, Popova and Stepanova tested Constructivist spatial ideas in a public form. A more populist version of this was developed by [[Alexander Tairov]], with stage sets by [[Aleksandra Ekster]] and the Stenberg brothers. These ideas would influence German directors like [[Bertolt Brecht]] and [[Erwin Piscator]], as well as the early Soviet cinema.

==Tatlin, 'Construction Art' and Productivism==
The key work of Constructivism was Vladimir Tatlin's proposal for the [[Tatlin's Tower|Monument to the Third International]] (Tatlin's Tower) (1919–20)&lt;ref name=HF&gt;[[Hugh Honour|Honour, H.]] and Fleming, J. (2009) ''A World History of Art''. 7th edn. London: Laurence King Publishing, p. 819. {{ISBN|9781856695848}}&lt;/ref&gt; which combined a machine aesthetic with dynamic components celebrating technology such as searchlights and projection screens. Gabo publicly criticized Tatlin's design saying, "Either create functional houses and bridges or create pure art, not both."  This had already caused a major controversy in the Moscow group in 1920 when Gabo and Pevsner's ''[[Realistic Manifesto]]'' asserted a spiritual core for the movement. This was opposed to the utilitarian and adaptable version of Constructivism held by Tatlin and Rodchenko. Tatlin's work was immediately hailed by artists in Germany as a revolution in art: a 1920 photograph shows [[George Grosz]] and [[John Heartfield]] holding a placard saying 'Art is Dead – Long Live Tatlin's Machine Art', while the designs for the tower were published in [[Bruno Taut]]'s magazine ''Fruhlicht''. The tower was never built, however, due to a lack of money following the revolution.&lt;ref name=Janson&gt;[[H. W. Janson|Janson, H.W.]] (1995) ''History of Art''. 5th edn. Revised and expanded by Anthony F. Janson. London: [[Thames &amp; Hudson]], p. 820. {{ISBN|0500237018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Tatlin's tower started a period of exchange of ideas between Moscow and Berlin, something reinforced by El Lissitzky and [[Ilya Ehrenburg]]'s Soviet-German magazine ''Veshch-Gegenstand-Objet'' which spread the idea of 'Construction art', as did the Constructivist exhibits at the 1922 ''Russische Ausstellung'' in Berlin, organised by Lissitzky. A [[Constructivist International]] was formed, which met with Dadaists and De Stijl artists in Germany in 1922. Participants in this short-lived international included Lissitzky, [[Hans Richter (artist)|Hans Richter]], and [[László Moholy-Nagy]]. However the idea of 'art' was becoming anathema to the Russian Constructivists: the INKhUK debates of 1920–22 had culminated in the theory of [[Productivism]] propounded by Osip Brik and others, which demanded direct participation in industry and the end of easel painting. Tatlin was one of the first to attempt to transfer his talents to industrial production, with his designs for an economical stove, for workers' overalls and for furniture. The Utopian element in Constructivism was maintained by his 'letatlin', a flying machine which he worked on until the 1930s.

==Constructivism and consumerism==
In 1921, the [[New Economic Policy]] was established in the Soviet Union, which opened up more market opportunities in the Soviet economy. Rodchenko, Stepanova, and others made advertising for the co-operatives that were now in competition with other commercial businesses. The poet-artist Vladimir Mayakovsky and Rodchenko worked together and called themselves "''advertising constructors''". Together they designed eye-catching images featuring bright colours, geometric shapes, and bold lettering.  The lettering of most of these designs was intended to create a reaction, and function emotionally – most were designed for the state-owned department store [[Mosselprom]] in Moscow, for pacifiers, cooking oil, beer and other quotidian products, with Mayakovsky claiming that his 'nowhere else but Mosselprom' verse was one of the best he ever wrote. 
Additionally, several artists tried to work with clothes design with varying success: Varvara Stepanova designed dresses with bright, geometric patterns that were mass-produced, although workers' overalls by Tatlin and Rodchenko never achieved this and remained prototypes. The painter and designer [[Lyubov Popova]] designed a kind of Constructivist [[flapper]] dress before her early death in 1924, the plans for which were published in the journal ''[[LEF (journal)|LEF]]''. In these works, Constructivists showed a willingness to involve themselves in fashion and the mass market, which they tried to balance with their Communist beliefs.

==LEF and Constructivist cinema==
[[Image:Aelita screenshot.jpg|thumb|240px|left|Constructivist Martian set in ''[[Aelita]]'' (1924)]]
The Soviet Constructivists organised themselves in the 1920s into the 'Left Front of the Arts',  who produced the influential journal ''LEF'', (which had two series, from 1923–5 and from 1927–9 as ''New LEF''). LEF was dedicated to maintaining the avant-garde against the critiques of the incipient [[Socialist Realism]], and the possibility of a capitalist restoration, with the journal being particularly scathing about the 'NEPmen', the capitalists of the period. For LEF the new medium of cinema was more important than the easel painting and traditional narratives that elements of the Communist Party were trying to revive then. Important Constructivists were very involved with cinema, with Mayakovsky acting in the film ''The Young Lady and the Hooligan'' (1919), Rodchenko's designs for the intertitles and animated sequences of [[Dziga Vertov]]'s ''Kino Eye'' (1924), and [[Aleksandra Ekster]] designs for the sets and costumes of the science fiction film ''[[Aelita]]'' (1924).

The Productivist theorists Osip Brik and [[Sergei Tretyakov (writer)|Sergei Tretyakov]] also wrote screenplays and intertitles, for films such as [[Vsevolod Pudovkin]]'s ''Storm over Asia'' (1928) or Victor Turin's ''Turksib'' (1929). The filmmakers and LEF contributors Dziga Vertov and [[Sergei Eisenstein]] as well as the documentarist [[Esfir Shub]] also regarded their fast-cut, montage style of filmmaking as Constructivist. The early [[Eccentrist]] movies of  [[Grigori Kozintsev]] and [[Leonid Trauberg]] (''[[The New Babylon]]'', ''[[Alone (1931 film)|Alone]]'') had similarly avant-garde intentions, as well as a fixation on jazz-age America which was characteristic of the philosophy, with its praise of slapstick-comedy actors like [[Charlie Chaplin]] and [[Buster Keaton]], as well as of [[Fordist]] mass production. Like the photomontages and designs of Constructivism, early [[Soviet film|Soviet cinema]] concentrated on creating an agitational effect by montage and 'making strange'.

==Photography and photomontage==
The Constructivists were early developers of the techniques of [[photomontage]]. Gustav Klutsis' 'Dynamic City' and 'Lenin and Electrification' (1919–20) are the first examples of this method of montage, which had in common with [[Dadaism]] the collaging together of news photographs and painted sections. However Constructivist montages would be less 'destructive' than those of Dadaism. Perhaps the most famous of these montages was Rodchenko's illustrations of the Mayakovsky poem ''About This''.

LEF also helped popularise a distinctive style of photography, involving jagged angles and contrasts and an abstract use of light, which paralleled the work of [[László Moholy-Nagy]] in Germany: the major practitioners of this included, along with Rodchenko, [[Boris Ignatovich]] and [[Max Penson]], among others. This also shared many characteristics with the early documentary movement.

==Constructivist graphic design==
[[File:'Proun Vrashchenia' by El Lissitzky, ca. 1919.jpg|thumb|'Proun Vrashchenia' by [[El Lissitzky]], 1919]]
The book designs of Rodchenko, El Lissitzky and others such as [[Solomon Telingater]] and [[Anton Lavinsky]] were a major inspiration for the work of radical designers in the West, particularly [[Jan Tschichold]]. Many Constructivists worked on the design of posters for everything from cinema to political propaganda: the former represented best by the brightly coloured, geometric posters of the Stenberg brothers (Georgii and Vladimir Stenberg), and the latter by the agitational photomontage work of [[Gustav Klutsis]] and [[Valentina Kulagina]].

In [[Cologne]] in the late 1920s [[Figurative Constructivism]] emerged from the [[Cologne Progressives]], a group which had links with Russian Constructivists, particularly Lissitzky, since the early twenties. Through their collaboration with [[Otto Neurath]] and the [[Gesellschafts- und Wirtschaftsmuseum]] such artists as [[Gerd Antz]], [[Augustin Tschinkel]] and [[Peter Alma]] they affected the development of the [[Isotype (picture language)|Vienna Method]]. This link was most clearly shown in ''A bis Z'' a journal published by [[Franz Seiwert]] the principal theorist of the group.&lt;ref&gt;Benus B. (2013) 'Figurative Constructivism and sociological graphics' in ''Isotype: Design and Contexts 1925-71'' London: Hyphen Press, pp.216-248&lt;/ref&gt; They were active in Russia working with [[IZOSTAT]] and Tschinkel worked with [[Ladislav Sutnar ]] before he emigrated to the US.

The Constructivists' main early political patron was [[Leon Trotsky]], and it began to be regarded with suspicion after the expulsion of Trotsky and the Left Opposition in 1927-8. The [[Communist Party of the Soviet Union|Communist Party]] would gradually favour realist art during the course of the 1920s (as early as 1918 ''[[Pravda]]'' had complained that government funds were being used to buy works by untried artists). However it was not until about 1934 that the counter-doctrine of [[Socialist Realism]] was instituted in Constructivism's place. Many Constructivists continued to produce avantgarde work in the service of the state, such as Lissitzky, Rodchenko and Stepanova's designs for the magazine ''[[USSR In Construction]]''.

==Constructivist architecture==
{{main|Constructivist architecture}}

Constructivist architecture emerged from the wider constructivist art movement. After the [[Russian Revolution of 1917]] it turned its attentions to the new social demands and industrial tasks required of the new regime. Two distinct threads emerged, the first was encapsulated in Antoine Pevsner's and Naum Gabo's ''[[Realist manifesto]]'' which was concerned with space and rhythm, the second represented a struggle within the [[Narkompros|Commissariat for Enlightenment]] between those who argued for ''pure art'' and the [[Productivism (art)|Productivists]] such as Alexander Rodchenko, Varvara Stepanova and Vladimir Tatlin, a more socially oriented group who wanted this art to be absorbed in industrial production.&lt;ref name="thought"&gt;{{Cite book| last = Oliver Stallybrass | first = and Alan Bullock (et al.) | title = The Fontana Dictionary of Modern Thought | year = 1988 | type = Paperback | publisher = Fontana press | isbn = 0-00-686129-6 | page = 918 pages}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A split occurred in 1922 when Pevsner and Gabo emigrated. The movement then developed along socially [[utilitarian]] lines. The productivist majority gained the support of the [[Proletkult]] and the magazine LEF, and later became the dominant influence of the architectural group [[OSA Group|O.S.A.]], directed by [[Alexander Vesnin]] and [[Moisei Ginzburg]].

==Legacy==
A number of Constructivists would teach or lecture at the [[Bauhaus]] schools in Germany, and some of the VKhUTEMAS teaching methods were adopted and developed there. Gabo established a version of Constructivism in England during the 1930s and 1940s that was adopted by architects, designers and artists after World War I (see [[Victor Pasmore]]), and [[John McHale (artist)|John McHale]].  [[Joaquín Torres García]] and [[Manuel Rendón]] were instrumental in spreading Constructivism throughout Europe and Latin America.  Constructivism had an effect on the modern masters of Latin America such as: [[Carlos Mérida]], [[Enrique Tábara]], [[Aníbal Villacís]], [[Theo Constanté]], [[Oswaldo Viteri]],  [[Estuardo Maldonado]], [[Luis Molinari]], [[Carlos Catasse]], [[João Batista Vilanova Artigas]] and [[Oscar Niemeyer]], to name just a few. There have also been disciples in Australia, the painter [[George Johnson (artist)|George Johnson]] being the best known.

In the 1980s graphic designer [[Neville Brody]] used styles based on Constructivist posters that initiated a revival of popular interest. Also during the 1980s designer Ian Anderson founded [[The Designers Republic]], a successful and influential design company which used constructivist principles.

So-called [[Deconstructivism|Deconstructivist]] architecture was developed by architects [[Zaha Hadid]], [[Rem Koolhaas]] and others during the late 20th and early 21st centuries. Zaha Hadid by her sketches and drawings of abstract triangles and rectangles evokes the aesthetic of constructivism. Though similar formally, the socialist political connotations of Russian constructivism are deemphasized by Hadid's deconstructivism. Rem Koolhaas' projects revive another aspect of constructivism. The [[scaffold]] and [[Crane (machine)|crane]]-like structures represented by many constructivist architects are used for the finished forms of his designs and buildings.

'''Demersal fish''' live and feed on or near the bottom of [[ocean|sea]]s or [[lake]]s (the [[demersal zone]]).&lt;ref name="seafloor"&gt;Walrond C [http://www.teara.govt.nz/en/coastal-fish/5 Carl . "Coastal fish - Fish of the open sea floor"] Te Ara - the Encyclopedia of New Zealand. Updated 2 March 2009&lt;/ref&gt; They occupy the sea floors and lake beds, which usually consist of mud, sand, gravel or rocks.&lt;ref name="seafloor" /&gt; In coastal waters they are found on or near the [[continental shelf]], and in deep waters they are found on or near the [[continental slope]] or along the continental rise. They are not generally found in the deepest waters, such as [[Abyssal zone|abyssal]] depths or on the [[abyssal plain]], but they can be found around [[seamount]]s and islands. The word ''demersal'' comes from the [[Latin]] ''demergere'', which means ''to sink''.
 
Demersal fish are [[bottom feeder]]s. They can be contrasted with [[pelagic fish]] which live and feed away from the bottom in the open [[water column]].
Demersal fish fillets contain little [[fish oil]] (one to four percent), whereas pelagic fish can contain up to 30 percent.{{citation needed (lead)|date=May 2018}}

==Types==
[[File:Jan van Kessel 004.jpg|thumb|right| Benthic [[flatfish]] and benthopelagic [[cod]] on a shore – [[Jan van Kessel, senior|Jan van Kessel]] senior, 1626–1679]]

Demersal fish can be divided into two main types: strictly '''[[Benthic zone|benthic]]''' fish which can rest on the sea floor, and '''benthopelagic''' fish which can float in the [[water column]] just above the sea floor.

Benthopelagic fish have [[neutral buoyancy]], so they can float at depth without much effort, while strictly benthic fish are denser, with negative buoyancy so they can lie on the bottom without any effort.&lt;ref name="Bone42" /&gt; Most demersal fish are benthopelagic.&lt;ref name="seafloor" /&gt;

As with other bottom feeders, a mechanism to deal with [[Substrate (marine biology)|substrate]] is often necessary. With demersal fish the sand is usually pumped out of the mouth through the [[gill slit]]. Most demersal fish exhibit a flat ventral region so as to more easily rest their body on the substrate. The exception may be the flatfish, which are laterally depressed but lie on their sides. Also, many exhibit what is termed an "inferior" mouth, which means that the mouth is pointed downwards; this is beneficial as their food is often below them in the substrate. Those bottom feeders with upward-pointing mouths, such as [[Stargazer (fish)|stargazer]]s, tend to seize swimming prey.

===Benthic fish===
Benthic fish, sometimes called [[groundfish]], are denser than water, so they can rest on the sea floor. They either lie-and-wait as [[ambush predator]]s, maybe covering themselves with sand or otherwise camouflaging themselves, or move actively over the bottom in search for food.&lt;ref name="Moyle588"/&gt; Benthic fish which can bury themselves include [[dragonets]], [[flatfish]] and [[stingray]]s.

[[Flatfish]] are an [[order (biology)|order]] of [[ray-finned fish|ray-finned]] benthic fishes which lie flat on the ocean floor. Examples are [[flounder]], [[sole (fish)|sole]], [[turbot]], [[plaice]], and [[halibut]]. The adult fish of many species have both eyes on one side of the head. When the fish hatches, one eye is located on each side of its head. But as the fish grows from the larval stage, one eye migrates to the other side of the body as a process of [[metamorphosis]].  The flatfish then changes its habits, and camouflages itself by lying on the bottom of the ocean floor with both eyes facing upwards.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Fairchild, E.A. and Howell, W.H |title=Factors affecting the post-release survival of cultured juvenile Pseudopleuronectes americanus |journal=Journal of Fish Biology |volume=65 |issue=Supplementary A |pages=69–87 |format=PDF |url=http://cinemar.unh.edu/fisheries/stock_enhancement/05_jfb529.pdf |doi=10.1111/j.0022-1112.2004.00529.x |year=2004 |first1=E.

Accessed 2009-06-08.&lt;/ref&gt; The side to which one eye migrates depends on the species; with some species both eyes are ultimately on the left side, whereas with other species the eyes are on the right.

&lt;/gallery&gt;

Flounder ambush their prey, feeding at soft muddy area of the sea bottom, near bridge piles, docks, artificial and coral reefs. Their diet consists mainly of fish spawn, [[crustacean]]s, [[polychaete]]s and small fish. 
&lt;!-- They have also been found at the deepest depths of the ocean, at bottom of the [[Mariana trench]], the deepest known location on Earth's crust. Swiss scientist [[Jacques Piccard]] and US Navy Lt. [[Don Walsh]] reached a depth of 10,916 m (35,813 ft) and were surprised to discover [[sole (fish)|sole]] or flounder about 30 cm (1 ft) long, and shrimp there. (sounds like BS) --&gt;

The [[great hammerhead]] swings its head in broad angles over the sea floor to pick up the electrical signatures of stingrays buried in the sand. It then uses its "hammer" to pin down the stingray.{{cn|date=May 2018}}

&lt;/gallery&gt;

Some fishes don't fit into the above classification. For example, the family of nearly blind [[spiderfish]]es, common and widely distributed, feed on benthopelagic zooplankton. Yet they are strictly benthic fish, since they stay in contact with the bottom. Their fins have long rays they use to "stand" on the bottom while they face the current and grab zooplankton as it passes by.&lt;ref&gt;Sulak KJ () [http://www.springerlink.com/content/p262p22172hv8600/ "The systematics and biology of ''Bathypterois (Pisces, Chlorophthalmidae)'' with a revised classification of benthic myctophiform fishes"]	''Ichthyological Research'', '''32'''(4)443-446.&lt;/ref&gt;

The bodies of benthic fish are adapted for ongoing contact with the sea floor.  Swimbladders are usually absent or reduced, and the bodies are usually flattened in one way or another.&lt;ref name="Moyle13"&gt;Moyle and Cech, 2004, p. 13&lt;/ref&gt; Following Moyle and Cech (2004) they can be divided into five overlapping body shapes:&lt;ref name="Moyle13" /&gt;

The simplest arrangement is possessed by [[sculpin]]s, which use their small, closely spaced pelvic fins,  as antiskid devices. However, other families of fishes, such as [[Goby|gobies]],  and [[clingfish]]es have evolved suction cups."&lt;ref name="Moyle14"/&gt;

Benthopelagic fish inhabit the water just above the bottom, feeding on [[benthos]] and [[zooplankton]].&lt;ref&gt;Mauchline J and Gordon JDM (1986) "Foraging strategies of deep-sea fish"] ''Mar. Ecol. Prog. Ser.'' '''27''': 227-238. [http://www.int-res.com/articles/meps/27/m027p227.pdf Download]&lt;/ref&gt; Most demersal fish are benthopelagic.&lt;ref name="seafloor" /&gt;

Deep sea benthopelagic [[teleost]]s all have [[swimbladder]]s. The dominant species, [[rattail]]s and [[cusk eel]]s, have considerable biomass. Other species include deep sea [[cod]]s ([[Moridae|morids]]), deep sea eels, [[halosaur]]s and [[Notacanthiformes|notacanth]]s.&lt;ref name="Bone43"&gt;Bone 2008, p. 43.&lt;/ref&gt;

Benthopelagic sharks, like the deep sea [[Squaliformes|squaloid sharks]], achieve neutral buoyancy with the use of large [[shark liver oil|oil-filled livers]].&lt;ref name="Bone42"&gt;Bone 2008, p. 42.&lt;/ref&gt; Sharks adapt well to fairly high pressures. They can often be found on slopes down to about 2000 metres, scavenging on food falls such as [[Whale fall|dead whales]]. However, the energy demands of sharks are high, since they need to swim constantly and maintain a large amount of oil for buoyancy. These energy needs cannot be met in the extreme [[oligotrophic]] conditions that occur at great depths.&lt;ref name="Bone42" /&gt;

Shallow water stingrays are benthic, and can lie on the bottom because of their negative buoyancy. Deep sea stingrays are benthopelagic, and like the squaloids have very large livers which give them neutral buoyancy.&lt;ref name="Bone42" /&gt;

Benthopelagic fish can be divided into flabby or robust body types. Flabby benthopelagic fishes are like [[bathypelagic fish]]es; they have a reduced body mass, and low metabolic rates, expending minimal energy as they lie and wait to [[Ambush predator|ambush]] prey.&lt;ref&gt;Koslow JA (1996) [http://www3.interscience.wiley.com/journal/119203567/abstract "Energetic and life-history patterns of deep-sea benthic, benthopelagic and seamount-associated fish"] ''Journal of Fish Biology'', '''49'''(sA) 54-74.&lt;/ref&gt; An example of a flabby fish is the [[cusk-eel]] ''Acanthonus armatus'',&lt;ref name="fishbase"&gt;{{fishbase species |genus=Acanthonus |species=armatus |year=2009 |month=August}}&lt;/ref&gt; a predator with a huge head and a body that is 90 percent water. This fish has the largest ears ([[otolith]]s) and the smallest brain in relation to its body size of all known vertebrates.&lt;ref name="Fine"&gt;Fine ML, Horn MH and Cox B (1987) [http://rspb.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/230/1259/257.abstract "''Acanthonus armatus'', a Deep-Sea Teleost Fish with a Minute Brain and Large Ears"] ''Proceedings of the Royal Society B'', '''230'''(1259)257-265.&lt;/ref&gt;

Deepwater benthopelagic fish are robust, muscular swimmers that actively cruise the bottom searching for prey. They often live around features, such as [[seamount]]s, which have strong currents.&lt;ref name="Fine"/&gt; Commercial examples are the [[orange roughy]] and [[Patagonian toothfish]].

==Habitats==
[[File:Continental shelf.png|thumb|Profile illustrating the shelf, slope and rise]]
The edge of the [[continental shelf]] marks the boundary where the shelf gives way to, and then gradually drops into [[abyssal]] depths. This edge marks the boundary between coastal, relatively shallow, benthic habitats, and the deep benthic habitats. Coastal demersal fishes live on the bottom of inshore waters, such as bays and estuaries, and further out, on the floor of the [[continental shelf]]. Deep water demersal fish live beyond this edge, mostly down the [[continental slope]]s and along the continental rises which drop to the [[abyssal plain]]s. This is the [[continental margin]], constituting about 28% of the total oceanic area.&lt;ref name=pjccc&gt;P. J. Cook, Chris Carleton (2000) "Continental Shelf Limits: The Scientific and Legal Interface", {{ISBN|0-19-511782-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other deep sea demersal fish can also be found around [[seamount]]s and islands.

The term ''bathydemersal fish'' is sometimes used instead of "deep water demersal fish". ''Bathydemersal'' refers to demersal fish which live at depths greater than 200 metres.

The term ''epibenthic'' is also used to refer to organism that live on top of the ocean floor, as opposed to those that burrow into the seafloor substrate. However the terms ''mesodemersal'', ''epidemersal'', ''mesobenthic'' and ''bathybenthic'' are not used.

===Coastal===
{{see also|Coastal fish|Reef fish}}

Coastal demersal fish are found on or near the seabed of coastal waters between the [[shoreline]] and the edge of the [[continental shelf]], where the shelf drops into the deep ocean. Since the continental shelf is generally less than 200 metres deep, this means that coastal waters are generally [[epipelagic]]. The term includes demersal [[reef fish]] and demersal fish that inhabit [[estuaries]], [[inlet]]s and [[bay]]s.

Young [[mangrove jack]]s, a sought after eating and [[sport fish]], dwell in [[estuaries]] around [[mangrove]] roots, fallen trees, rock walls, and any other snag areas where smaller prey reside for protection. When they mature, they migrate into open waters, sometimes hundreds of kilometres from the coast to spawn.&lt;ref&gt;Russell, D.J., et al., "Biology, Management and Genetic Stock Structure of Mangrove Jack (Lutjanus argentimaculatus) in Australia,"  The State of Queensland, Department of Primary Industries and the Fisheries Research Development Corporation, FRDC Project Number 1999/122, 2003.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fao.org/figis/servlet/species?fid=3134|title=FAO Fisheries &amp; Aquaculture - Aquatic species|website=www.fao.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Stargazer (fish)|Stargazer]]s are found worldwide in shallow waters. They have eyes on top of their heads and a large upward-facing mouth. They bury themselves in sand, and leap upwards to ambush benthopelagic fish and [[invertebrate]]s that pass overhead. Some species have a worm-shaped lure growing out of the floor of the mouth, which they wiggle to attract prey. Stargazers are [[venom (poison)|venomous]] and can deliver [[electric shock]]s.

===Deep water===
[[File:Oceanic basin.svg|thumb|Cross-section of an ocean basin. Note significant [[vertical exaggeration]].]]

Deep water demersal fish occupy the [[Benthic zone|benthic regions]] beyond the continental margins.

On the [[continental slope]], demersal fishes are common. They are more diverse than coastal demersal fish, since there is more habitat diversity. Further out are the [[abyssal plain]]s. These flat, featureless regions occupy about 40 percent of the ocean floor. They are covered with [[Pelagic sediments|sediment]] but largely devoid of benthic life ([[benthos]]). Deep sea benthic fishes are more likely to associate with canyons or rock outcroppings among the plains, where invertebrate communities are established. Undersea mountains ([[seamount]]s) can intercept deep sea currents, and cause productive upwellings which support benthic fish. Undersea mountain ranges can separate underwater regions into different ecosystems.&lt;ref name="Moyle587"&gt;Moyle and Cech, 2004, p. 587&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Rattail]]s and [[Ophidiidae|brotula]]s are common, and other well-established families are [[eel]]s, [[eelpout]]s, [[hagfish]]es, [[greeneye]]s, [[Ogcocephalidae|batfish]]es and [[lumpfish]]es.&lt;ref name="Moyle587"/&gt;

The bodies of deep water demersal fishes are muscular with well developed organs. In this way they are closer to [[mesopelagic fish]]es than [[bathypelagic fish]]es. In other ways, they are more variable. [[Photophore]]s are usually absent, eyes and [[swimbladder]]s range from absent to well developed. They vary in size, and larger species, greater than one metre, are not uncommon.

[[File:Giant grenadier.jpg|thumb|left|[[Giant grenadier]], an elongate deep water demersal fish with large eyes and well-developed [[lateral line]]s]]

Deep sea demersal fish are usually long and narrow. Many are [[eel]]s or shaped like eels. This may be because long bodies have long [[lateral line]]s. Lateral lines detect low-frequency sounds, and some demersal fishes have muscles that drum such sounds to attract mates.&lt;ref name="Haedrich1996"&gt;Haedrich RL (1996) [http://www3.interscience.wiley.com/journal/119203565/abstract "Deep-water fishes: evolution and adaptation in the earth's largest living spaces"] ''Journal of Fish Biology'' '''49'''(sA):40-53.
&lt;/ref&gt; Smell is also important, as indicated by the rapidity with which demersal fish find traps baited with [[bait fish]].

The main diet of deep sea demersal fish is [[invertebrate]]s of the deep sea [[benthos]] and [[carrion]]. Smell, touch and lateral line sensitivities seem to be the main sensory devices for locating these.&lt;ref name="Moyle588"&gt;Moyle and Cech, 2004, p. 588&lt;/ref&gt;

Like coastal demersal fish, deep sea demersal fish can be divided into benthic fish and benthopelagic fish, where the benthic fish are negatively buoyant and benthopelagic fish are neutrally buoyant.&lt;ref name="Moyle588"/&gt;

The availability of plankton for food diminishes rapidly with depth. At 1000 metres, the biomass of plankton is typically about 1 percent of that at the surface, and at 5000 metres about 0.01 percent.&lt;ref name="Bone43" /&gt; Given there is no sunlight, energy enters deep water zones as organic matter. There are three main ways this happens. Firstly, organic matter can move into the zone from the continental landmass, for example, through currents that carry the matter down rivers, then plume along the continental shelf and finally spill down the continental slope. Other matter enters as particulate matter raining down from the overhead water column in the form of [[marine snow]], or as sinking overhead plant material such as [[Zostera|eelgrass]], or as "large particles" such as dead fish and whales sinking to the bottom. A third way energy can arrive is through fish, such as vertically migrating mesopelagic fishes that can enter into the demersal zone as they ascend or descend. The demersal fish and invertebrates consume organic matter that does arrive, break it down and recycle it. A consequence of these energy delivery mechanisms is that the abundance of demersal fish and invertebrates gradually decrease as the distance from continental shorelines increases.&lt;ref name="Moyle594"&gt;Moyle and Cech, 2004, p. 594&lt;/ref&gt;

Although deep water demersal fish species are not generally picky about what they eat, there is still some degree of specialisation. For example, different fish have different mouth sizes, which determines the size of the prey they can handle. Some feed mostly on benthopelagic organisms. Others fed mostly on [[epifauna]] (invertebrates on top of the seafloor surface, also called  ''epibenthos''), or alternatively on [[infauna]] (invertebrates that burrow into the seafloor substrate). Infauna feeders can have considerable sediment in their stomachs. Scavengers, such as [[snubnosed eel]]s and [[hagfish]], also eat infauna as a secondary food source.&lt;ref name="Sedberry"&gt;Sedberry GR and Musick JA (1978) [http://www.springerlink.com/content/g1684h788800708p/ "Feeding strategies of some demersal fishes of the continental slope and rise off the mid-Atlantic coast of the USA"] ''Marine Biology'', '''44''':357-375.&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;gallery&gt;
File:Simenchelys parasiticus.jpg|[[Snubnosed eel]]
File:Ilyophis brunneus.jpg|[[Muddy arrowtooth eel]]
File:Urophycis tenuis.jpg|[[White hake]]&lt;ref&gt;{{FishBase species|genus = Urophycis|species = tenuis|month=August|year=2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/gallery&gt;

Some feed on carrion. Cameras show that when a dead fish is placed on the bottom, vertebrate and invertebrate scavengers appear very quickly. If the fish is large, some scavengers burrow in and eat it from the inside out. Some fish, such as [[Rattail|grenadier]]s, also appear and start feeding on the scavenging inverebrates and [[amphipod]]s. Other specialization is based on depth distribution. Some of the more abundant upper continental slope fish species, such as [[cutthroat eel]] and [[Phycidae|longfinned hake]],&lt;ref&gt;{{fishbase species |genus=Phycis |species=chesteri |month=August |year=2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; mainly feed on [[epipelagic fish]]. But generally, the most abundant deep water demersal fish species feed on invertebrates.&lt;ref name="Sedberry" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Moyle595"&gt;Moyle and Cech, 2004, p. 595&lt;/ref&gt;

At great depths, food scarcity and extreme pressure limits the ability of fish to survive. The deepest point of the ocean is about 11,000 metres. [[Bathypelagic fish]]es are not normally found below 3,000 metres.&lt;ref name="nielsen"&gt;{{cite journal |title=The deepest living fish ''Abyssobrotula galatheae'': a new genus and species of oviparous ophidioids (Pisces, Brotulidae) |author=Nielsen, J.G. |journal=Galathea Report |year=1977 |volume=14 |pages=41–48}}&lt;/ref&gt; It may be that extreme pressures interfere with essential enzyme functions.&lt;ref name="TeAraBZ"&gt;Ryan P [http://www.teara.govt.nz/EarthSeaAndSky/SeaLife/DeepSeaCreatures/3/en "Deep-sea creatures: The bathypelagic zone"] ''Te Ara - the Encyclopedia of New Zealand''.

The fish were 30 centimetres long (12&amp;nbsp;in), and were darting about, using vibration sensors on their nose to catch shrimps.  The team also reported that the appearance of the fish, unlike that of most deep sea fish, was surprisingly "cute", and that they were surprised by how active the fish were at these depths.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/science/nature/7655358.stm 'Deepest ever' living fish filmed] ''BBC News'', 7 October 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{FishBase species|genus=Pseudoliparis|species=amblystomopsis|month=March|year=2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Demersal fisheries==
{{Update|section|date=November 2017}}

Most demersal fish of commercial or recreational interest are coastal, confined to the upper 200 metres. Commercially important demersal [[food fish]] species include [[flatfish]], such as [[flounder]], [[sole (fish)|sole]], [[turbot]], [[plaice]], and [[halibut]]. Also important are [[cod]], [[hake]], [[redfish]], [[haddock]], [[Bass (fish)|bass]], [[conger]]s, [[shark]]s, [[Batoidea|ray]]s and [[chimaera]]s.&lt;ref name="Grainger &amp; Garcia 1996"&gt;Grainger RJK and Garcia SM (1996) [http://www.fao.org/docrep/003/W3244E/w3244e00.htm#Contents "Chronicles of Marine Fishery Landings (1950-1994): Trend Analysis and Fisheries Potential"] ''[[FAO]]: Fisheries technical paper 359.''

File:Epinephelus malabaricus.jpg|[[Grouper]] are ambush predators with a powerful sucking system that sucks their prey in from a distance.
&lt;/gallery&gt;--&gt;

[[Black sea bass]] inhabit US coasts from [[Maine]] to NE [[Florida]] and the eastern [[Gulf of Mexico]], and are most abundant off the waters of [[New York (state)|New York]]. They are found in inshore waters (bays and sounds) and offshore in waters up to a depth of 130 m (425'). They spend most of their time close to the sea floor and are often congregated around bottom formations such as rocks, [[man-made reef]]s, wrecks, jetties, piers, and [[bridge pilings]]. Black sea bass are sought after recreational and commercial fish, and have been [[Overfishing|overfished]].&lt;ref name="striata"&gt;{{FishBase species | genus = Centropristis | species = striata | month = August | year = 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Grouper]] are often found around reefs. They have stout bodies and large mouths. They are not built for long-distance or fast swimming. They can be quite large, and lengths over a meter and weights up to 100&amp;nbsp;kg are not uncommon. They swallow prey rather than biting pieces off it. They do not have many teeth on the edges of their jaws, but they have heavy crushing tooth plates inside the [[pharynx]]. They lie in wait, rather than chasing in open water. They are found in areas of hard or consolidated substrate, and use structural features such as ledges, rocks, and coral reefs (as well as artificial reefs like wrecks and sunken barges) as their habitat. Their mouth and [[gill]]s form a powerful sucking system that sucks their prey in from a distance. They also use their mouth to dig into sand to form their shelters under big rocks, jetting it out through their gills. Their gill muscles are so powerful that it is nearly impossible to pull them out of their cave if they feel attacked and extend those muscles to lock themselves in. There is some research indicating that roving coral groupers (''Plectropomus pessuliferus'') sometimes cooperate with [[moray eel|giant morays]] in hunting.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Bshary|first1=Redouan|last2=Hohner|first2=Andrea|last3=Ait-el-Djoudi|first3=Karim|last4=Fricke|first4=Hans|date=|title=Interspecific Communicative and Coordinated Hunting between Groupers and Giant Moray Eels in the Red Sea|url=http://biology.plosjournals.org/perlserv/?request=get-document&amp;doi=10.1371/journal.pbio.0040431|journal=PLoS Biology|volume=4|issue=12|pages=|doi=10.1371/journal.pbio.0040431|via=plosjournals.org|website=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Conservation status==
{{common fish}}

Major demersal fishery species in the [[North Sea]] such as [[cod]], [[plaice]], [[monkfish]] and [[sole (fish)|sole]], are listed by the [[International Council for the Exploration of the Sea|ICES]] as "outside safe biological limits."

* The True Sole ''[[solea solea]]'' is sufficiently broadly distributed that it is not considered a threatened species; however, [[overfishing]] in Europe has produced severely diminished populations, with declining catches in many regions.  For example, the western [[English Channel]] and [[Irish Sea]] sole fisheries face potential collapse according to data in the UK [[Biodiversity Action Plan]].

Moreover, they are growing less quickly now and are rarely older than six years, although they can reach forty.

In [[telecommunications]], '''destination routing''' is a sequential pathway that messages must pass through to reach a target destination. In [[electronic switching system]]s for circuit based telephone calls, the destination stations are identified by a station address or more commonly, a destination [[telephone number]]. 

In the network there are various classes of switching systems. An end office switch connects directly to the stations.  It knows which circuit to activate (ring) when given a destination number. Other switches in the [[Telecommunications network|network]] are for transport only.  These are sometimes called [[Class 4 telephone switch|tandem switches]].  In this case, the goal of destination routing would be to select an outbound span for a particular destination number. The objective is to get a continuous signal path from the starting location of the caller to the ending location of the called party.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3412">'''Distance decay''' is a [[Human geography|geographical]] term which describes the effect of [[distance]] on cultural or spatial [[interaction]]s.  The distance decay effect states that the interaction between two locales declines as the distance between them increases. Once the distance is outside of the two locales' activity space, their interactions begin to decrease.

With the advent of faster travel, distance has less effect than it did in the past, except where places previously connected by now-[[abandoned railway]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;s, for example, have fallen off the beaten path. Advances in [[communications technology]], such as telegraphs, telephones, [[broadcasting]], and internet, have further decreased the effects of distance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url = http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0966692313000653 | doi=10.1016/j.jtrangeo.2013.04.001 | volume=31 | title=Boots are made for walking: interactions across physical and social space in infrastructure-poor regions | year=2013 | journal=Journal of Transport Geography | pages=226–235 | author=Matous Petr, Todo Yasuyuki, Mojo Dagne}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Distance decay is graphically represented by a curving line that swoops [[convex function|concavely]] downward as distance along the x-axis increases.  Distance decay can be mathematically represented as an [[Inverse-square law]] by the expression

&lt;math&gt;I = const. \times d^{-2}&lt;/math&gt; 
or
&lt;math&gt;I \propto 1/d^2&lt;/math&gt;,

where I is interaction and d is distance. It can take other forms such as [[Exponential decay|negative exponential]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Nekola J. C., White P. S. | year = 1999 | title = The distance decay of similarity in biogeography and ecology | url = http://labs.bio.unc.edu/Peet/ecoinfo/distance_decay/nekolapeter.pdf | format = PDF | journal = Journal of Biogeography | volume = 26 | issue = | pages = 867–878 | doi=10.1046/j.1365-2699.1999.00305.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; i.e.

&lt;math&gt;I \propto e^{-d}&lt;/math&gt;
.

Distance decay is evident in town/[[city centre]]s. It can refer to various things which decline with greater distance from the center of the [[Central Business District]] (CBD):
* density of [[pedestrian]] traffic
* street quality 
* quality of shops (depending on definitions of 'quality' and 'center')
* height of buildings 
* [[bid rent theory|price of land]]

Distance decay weighs into the decision to migrate, leading many [[Human migration|migrants]] to move less far.

== Related concepts ==

Related terms include "[[friction of distance]]", which describes the force that creates distance decay and [[Waldo R. Tobler]]'s "[[Tobler's first law of geography|First law of geography]]", an informal statement that "All things are related, but near things are more related than far things." 
"[[Loss of Strength Gradient]]" holds that the amount of a nation's military power that could be brought to bear in any part of the world depends on geographic distance.

The '''ecological urbanism''' project draws from ecology to inspire an urbanism that is more socially inclusive and sensitive to the environment, as well as less ideologically driven, than [[green urbanism]] or [[Sustainable Urbanism|sustainable urbanism]]. In many ways, ecological urbanism is an evolution of, and a critique of, [[Landscape urbanism|Landscape Urbanism]] arguing for a more holistic approach to the design and management of cities. The term appeared first in 1998 as "EcoUrbanism" in a book by Architect and Planner Miguel Ruano,&lt;ref&gt;Eco-Urbanism: Sustainable Human Settlements, 60 Case Studies – Gustavo Gili, 1998 - 192 pages | http://www.abebooks.com/9788425217234/Eco-Urbanism-Sustainable-Human-Settlements-Case-8425217237/plp&lt;/ref&gt; who defined it as "the development of multi-dimensional sustainable human communities within harmonious and balanced built environments". The term was used later in April 2003 at a conference at the University of Oregon,&lt;ref&gt;http://pages.uoregon.edu/hopes/oldhopes/conf03/emailposter.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; and again in 2006 in a paper by Jeffrey Hou.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=HOJPAAAAMAAJ&amp;q=ecological+urbanism#search_anchor |title=Proceedings of the ... ACSA Annual ... – Association of Collegiate Schools of Architecture – Google Books |publisher=Google Books |accessdate=10 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The phrase was used by [[Mohsen Mostafavi]] in 2007 in ''Intervention Architecture''&lt;ref name="Intervention architecture"/&gt; and in a lecture at the [[Canadian Centre for Architecture]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cca.qc.ca/en/education-events/247-sustainable |title=Sustainable? &amp;#124; Canadian Centre for Architecture |publisher=CCA |date=17 June 2007 |accessdate=10 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; ecological urbanism as a project was largely started at [[Harvard University Graduate School of Design]], with a conference, and exhibition, and book.&lt;ref name="Ecological Urbanism Harvard"/&gt;

Arguing for a "new ethics and aesthetics of the urban," the 656-page ''Ecological Urbanism'' book, edited by Mohsen Mostafavi with Gareth Doherty, was published in May 2010 by Lars Müller Publishers ({{ISBN|978-3-03778-189-0}}).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lars-mueller-publishers.com/en/catalogue-architecture |title=Architecture – Lars Müller Publishers |publisher=Lars-mueller-publishers.com |date=14 July 1938 |accessdate=10 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The book follows the conference,&lt;ref name="conference"/&gt; and exhibition, held at the GSD in 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.boston.com/ae/theater_arts/articles/2009/04/12/exhibit_provides_sense_of_the_future/ | work=The Boston Globe | first=Robert | last=Campbell | title=Exhibit provides sense of the future | date=12 April 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ecologicalurbanism.gsd.harvard.edu/exhibition.php |title=Exhibition on Ecological Urbanism – Harvard Graduate School of Design |publisher=Ecologicalurbanism.gsd.harvard.edu |date=17 May 2009 |accessdate=10 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gsd.harvard.edu/events/exhibitions/Ecological%20Urbanism/eco_urban_final.htm ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100708031955/http://www.gsd.harvard.edu/events/exhibitions/Ecological%20Urbanism/eco_urban_final.htm |date=8 July 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The book has a long list of contributors, including [[Rem Koolhaas]], [[Homi K. Bhabha]], [[Mitchell Joachim]], [[Andrea Branzi]], and about 130 others. A blog during the conference is part of the book.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://gsd-ecologicalurbanism.blogspot.com/ |title=GSD:ecologicalurbanism |publisher=Gsd-ecologicalurbanism.blogspot.com |accessdate=10 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to [http://www.architecturetoday.co.uk/ ''Architecture Today''], the book is "one of the few books that recognises and articulates how, if this systems-based approach is to be successful, it needs to design, integrate and express complex systems and social processes in ways that are fundamentally humane."&lt;ref name="AT Review"/&gt; The book has been reviewed and cited in many publications, including [''Metropolis Magazine''],&lt;ref name="Metropolis review"/&gt; [http://www.info-jola.de/ ''The Journal of Landscape Architecture''],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jola-lab.eu/www/issues.html |title=JoLA &amp;#124; Issue 11 &amp;#124; Spring 2011 |publisher=Jola-lab.eu |accessdate=10 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  and [http://www.citiesthemagazine.com/ Cities magazine].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Cities |url=http://vimeo.com/16500456 |title=Ecological Urbanism – Book Review On Vimeo |publisher=Vimeo.com |accessdate=10 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Events and discussions on the book have been held at the 2010 Venice Biennale,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.abitare.it/biennale-to-the-people/anticipate/ |title=Anticipate? &amp;#124; Abitare |publisher=Abitare.it |accessdate=10 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Storefront for Art and Architecture]] in New York, and at the Van Alen Institute in New York.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vanalen.org/projects/events/EcologicalExchange |title=Van Alen Institute – Events – Ecological Urbanism and Green Gone Wrong: An Exchange |publisher=Vanalen.org |accessdate=10 November 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111129110856/http://www.vanalen.org/projects/events/EcologicalExchange |archivedate=29 November 2011 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In his introduction to the ''Ecological Urbanism'', "Why Ecological Urbanism? Why Now?", extracted in [https://www.topos.de/ ''Topos: The International Review of Landscape Architecture and Urban Design''], Mostafavi asks: "Increased numbers of people and cities go hand in hand with a greater exploitation of the world’s limited resources. Every year, more cities are feeling the devastating impacts of this situation. What are we to do? What means do we have as designers to address this challenging reality?&lt;ref&gt;https://www.topos.de/Previous-issue/detail-991.html&lt;/ref&gt;

Jeb Brugmann in his book ''Welcome to the Urban Revolution: How Cities Are Changing the World'' (Bloomsbury Press, 2009) says we need to become "masters of a stable, just, and ecological urbanism." For Brugmann, "The first step towards ecological urbanism is increasing the energy and nutrient productivity within the city, but the only way to move sufficiently from extractive mode to a sustainable productive mode is to think, design, and develop at the scale of the City."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.policyinnovations.org/ideas/innovations/data/000176 |title=Welcome to the Urban Revolution |publisher=Policyinnovations.org |date=28 October 2010 |accessdate=10 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There have been a number of recent conferences and lectures on the project of ecological urbanism, including: The New Aesthetics and Ecological Urbanism at Peking University in October 2010,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.alicerawsthorn.com/talks_debates.php |title=Alice Rawsthorn |publisher=Alice Rawsthorn |accessdate=10 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  New Zealand Institute of Landscape Architects Spring Lecture Series: Ecological Urbanism: A Prospectus for the Super City, in October 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dinz.org.nz/Events/2010/October/46049 |title=Events – NZILA Spring Lecture Series: Ecological Urbanism – a prospectus for the super city |publisher=DINZ |date=1 October 2010 |accessdate=10 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The University of Washington’s urban initiative included a seminar on Now Urbanism&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=21Oct10 |url=http://sawyerseminaratuw.wordpress.com/2010/10/21/ecological-urbanism-gradseminar/ |title=Ecological Urbanism [gradseminar&amp;#93; « Now Urbanism |publisher=Sawyerseminaratuw.wordpress.com |accessdate=10 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; and talks "on Ecological Urbanism, Ecological Design for Healthy Cities, Networked Urbanism, and America’s War on Immigrants.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Roth |first=Rick |url=http://depts.washington.edu/geog/2010/10/city-making-in-the-21st-century-and-beyond/ |title=City Making In The 21st century and Beyond &amp;#124; Department of Geography |publisher=Depts.washington.edu |date=4 October 2010 |accessdate=10 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Eco-Urbanism: towards sustainable city living, was hosted by Nottingham University at the Shanghai Expo in August 2010.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.nottingham.ac.uk/.../eco-urbanismprogramme.doc&lt;/ref&gt;

Together and coupled with aesthetic and expressionist design principles, they form the foundation for urban design."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://design.asu.edu/events/lectures_archive.php}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism of ecological urbanism==
Ecological urbanism has been criticized as an idea that is loosely defined from a set of flashy projects. These are expensive schemes with a commercial and esthetic purpose that satisfy a local or regional ambition to invest in ecology or sustainability without posing a more globally applicable approach. A true merger of landscape architecture with the field of Urban Ecology lacks. From this criticism Frederick Steiner introduced landscape ecological urbanism as an approach that can include the field of urban ecology and Wybe Kuitert has shown how such integrative planning and management of the city should rely on analysis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Steiner | first1 = F.

Potential vegetation maps for a city are the tool to this end.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Kuitert | first1 =  | year = 2013 | title = The Nature of Urban Seoul: Potential Vegetation Derived from the Soil Map | doi = 10.1080/12265934.2013.766505 | journal = International Journal of Urban Sciences | volume = 17 | issue = 1| pages = 95–108 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ecological Urbanism is explained as a successor to Landscape Urbanism without the difference between the two approaches, and the terms used in the new approach, being defined. Jason King sees it as an inadequately explained addition to a list of 61 other 'Fill-in-the-blank Urbanisms'.&lt;ref&gt;http://landscapeandurbanism.blogspot.co.uk/2010/05/ecological-urbanism-introduction-part-2.html&lt;/ref&gt; [[Tom Turner]] welcomes landscape and ecological urbanism as 'the most significant contributions to landscape design theory since the landscape architecture profession was launched in the mid-nineteenth century' but is 'unpersuaded by the change of name' &lt;ref&gt;http://www.gardenvisit.com/blog/2014/01/02/landscape-ecological-urbanism/&lt;/ref&gt;

An '''ecosystem model''' is an [[abstract model|abstract]], usually [[mathematical model|mathematical]], representation of an [[ecological system]] (ranging in scale from an individual [[population]], to an [[ecological community]], or even an entire [[biome]]), which is studied to better understand the real system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Hall, Charles A.S.|author2=Day, John W.|last-author-amp=yes|title=Ecosystem Modeling in Theory and Practice: An Introduction with Case Histories|publisher=University Press of Colorado|year=1990|isbn=978-0-87081-216-3|pages=7–8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Using data gathered from the field, ecological relationships—such as the relation of sunlight and water availability to [[photosynthetic]] rate, or that between [[predator and prey]] populations—are derived, and these are combined to form [[ecosystem]] models. These model systems are then studied in order to make predictions about the dynamics of the real system. Often, the study of inaccuracies in the model (when compared to empirical observations) will lead to the generation of hypotheses about possible ecological relations that are not yet known or well understood. Models enable researchers to simulate large-scale experiments that would be too costly or unethical to perform on a real ecosystem. They also enable the simulation of ecological processes over very long periods of time (i.e. simulating a process that takes centuries in reality, can be done in a matter of minutes in a computer model).&lt;ref&gt;Hall &amp; Day, 1990: pp. 13-14&lt;/ref&gt;

Ecosystem models have applications in a wide variety of disciplines, such as [[natural resource]] management,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |doi=10.1007/0-387-21563-8_1 |chapter=Opportunities for Using Ecological Models for Resource Management |title=Ecological Modeling for Resource Management |pages=3–19 |year=2003 |last1=Dale |first1=Virginia H. |isbn=978-0-387-95493-6 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[ecotoxicology]] and [[environmental health]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Pastorok, Robert A.|chapter=Introduction|title=Ecological modeling in risk assessment: chemical effects on populations, ecosystems, and landscapes|publisher=CRC Press|year=2002|isbn=978-1-56670-574-5|page=7|chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=LNdRGbpDWgUC&amp;pg=PA7}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Forbes, Valery E.|chapter=The Role of Ecological Modeling in Risk Assessments Seen From an Academic's Point of View|editor=Thorbek, Pernille|title=Ecological Models for Regulatory Risk Assessments of Pesticides: Developing a Strategy for the Future|publisher=CRC Press|year=2009|isbn=978-1-4398-0511-4|page=89|chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=CYzT5ZIy2NEC&amp;pg=PA89}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[agriculture]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Palladino, Paolo|chapter=Ecological Modeling and Integrated Pest Management|title=Entomology, ecology and agriculture: the making of scientific careers in North America, 1885-1985|publisher=Psychology Press|year=1996|isbn=978-3-7186-5907-4|page=153|chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0JgLY_0QlWEC&amp;pg=PA153}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[wildlife conservation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Millspaugh, Joshua J.|chapter=General Principles for Developing Landscape Models for Wildlife Conservation|title=Models for planning wildlife conservation in large landscapes|publisher=Academic Press|year=2008|isbn=978-0-12-373631-4|page=1|chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=GLtcJs2f810C&amp;pg=PA1|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ecological modelling has even been applied to archaeology with varying degrees of success, for example, combining with archaeological models to explain the diversity and mobility of stone tools.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.jaa.2013.08.004 |title=Multiple Optima in Hoabinhian flaked stone artefact palaeoeconomics and palaeoecology at two archaeological sites in Northwest Thailand |journal=Journal of Anthropological Archaeology |volume=32 |issue=4 |pages=553–564 |year=2013 |last1=Marwick |first1=Ben }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Types of models==
There are two major types of ecological models, which are generally applied to different types of problems: (1) ''analytic'' models and (2) ''simulation'' / ''computational'' models. Analytic models are typically relatively simple (often linear) systems, that can be accurately described by a set of mathematical equations whose behavior is well-known. Simulation models on the other hand, use numerical techniques to solve problems for which analytic solutions are impractical or impossible. Simulation models tend to be more widely used, and are generally considered more ecologically realistic, while analytic models are valued for their mathematical elegance and explanatory power.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Jørgensen, Sven Erik|title=Handbook of environmental and ecological modeling|publisher=CRC Press|year=1996|isbn=978-1-56670-202-7|pages=403–404|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=hGJ1Jm6txQEC&amp;pg=PA403}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Grant, William Edward|author2=Swannack, Todd M.|last-author-amp=yes|title=Ecological modeling: a common-sense approach to theory and practice|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|year=2008|isbn=978-1-4051-6168-8|page=74|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=K3qUumawqEoC&amp;pg=PA74}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hall &amp; Day, 1990 p. 9&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ecopath]] is a powerful software system which uses simulation and computational methods to model [[marine ecosystems]].

==Model design==
[[File:Silver Spring Model.jpg|thumb|right|300px|Diagram of the Silver Springs model (Odum, 1971). Note the aggregation into functional groups such as "herbivores" or "decomposers".&lt;ref&gt;Odum, H.T. (1971). Environment, Power, and Society. Wiley-Interscience New York, N.Y.&lt;/ref&gt;]]

The process of model design begins with a specification of the problem to be solved, and the objectives for the model.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Soetaert, Karline|author2=Herman, Peter M.J.|last-author-amp=yes|title=A practical guide to ecological modelling: using R as a simulation platform|publisher=Springer|year=2009|isbn=978-1-4020-8623-6|page=11|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=aVjDtSmJqhAC&amp;pg=PA11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ecological systems are composed of an enormous number of biotic and abiotic factors that interact with each other in ways that are often unpredictable, or so complex as to be impossible to incorporate into a computable model. Because of this [[complexity]], [[ecosystem]] models typically simplify the systems they are studying to a limited number of components that are well understood, and deemed relevant to the problem that the model is intended to solve.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Gillman, Michael|author2=Hails, Rosemary|last-author-amp=yes|title=An introduction to ecological modelling: putting practice into theory|publisher=Wiley-Blackwell|year=1997|isbn=978-0-632-03634-9|page=4|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7U8Uf10TpyIC&amp;pg=PA4}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Müller, Felix|chapter=What are the General Conditions Under Which Ecological Models Can Be Applied|editor=Jopp, Fred|display-editors=etal|title=Modeling Complex Ecological Dynamics|publisher=Springer|year=2011|isbn=978-3-642-05028-2|pages=13–14|chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=AEgIo-BOzF0C&amp;pg=PA13|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The process of simplification typically reduces an ecosystem to a small number of [[state variable]]s and [[Function (mathematics)|mathematical functions]] that describe the nature of the relationships between them.&lt;ref&gt;Hall &amp; Day, 1990: p. 21&lt;/ref&gt; The number of ecosystem components that are incorporated into the model is limited by aggregating similar processes and entities into functional groups that are treated as a unit.&lt;ref&gt;Hall &amp; Day, 1990: p. 19&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.5733/afin.052.0112 |title=Functional Feeding Groups as a Taxonomic Surrogate for a Grassland Arthropod Assemblage |journal=African Invertebrates |volume=52 |pages=217–228 |year=2011 |last1=Buschke |first1=Falko T. |last2=Seaman |first2=Maitland T. }}&lt;/ref&gt;

After establishing the components to be modeled and the relationships between them, another important factor in ecosystem model structure is the representation of [[space]] used.  Historically, models have often ignored the confounding issue of space. However, for many ecological problems spatial dynamics are an important part of the problem, with different spatial environments leading to very different outcomes. ''Spatially explicit models'' (also called "spatially distributed" or "landscape" models) attempt to incorporate a heterogeneous spatial environment into the model.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=McCallum, Hamish|chapter=Spatial Parameters|title=Population parameters: estimation for ecological models|publisher=Wiley-Blackwell|year=2000|isbn=978-0-86542-740-2|page=184|chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=mFKIbI4cLUEC&amp;pg=PA184}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|editor=Tenhunen, John D.|display-editors=etal|title=Ecosystem approaches to landscape management in Central Europe|publisher=Springer|year=2001|isbn=978-3-540-67267-8|pages=586–587|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=WSanEfM25uAC&amp;pg=PA586}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Ball, George L.|chapter=Ecological modeling|title=Encyclopedia of environmental science|publisher=Springer|year=1999|isbn=978-0-412-74050-3|pages=154|chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Y0iX2z48qkUC&amp;pg=PA154}}&lt;/ref&gt; A spatial model is one that has one or more state variables that are a function of space, or can be related to other spatial variables.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Sklar, Fred H.|author2=Hunsaker, Carolyn T.|last-author-amp=yes|chapter=The Use and Uncertainties of Spatial Data for Landscape Models: An Overview with Examples from the Florida Everglades|editor=Hunsaker, Carolyn T.|title=Spatial uncertainty in ecology: implications for remote sensing and GIS applications|publisher=Springer|year=2001|isbn=978-0-387-95129-4|page=15|chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=HbczI9mw2v8C&amp;pg=PA15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Validation==
After construction, models are ''validated'' to ensure that the results are acceptably accurate or realistic. One method is to test the model with multiple sets of data that are independent of the actual system being studied. This is important since certain inputs can cause a faulty model to output correct results. Another method of validation is to compare the model's output with data collected from field observations. Researchers frequently specify beforehand how much of a disparity they are willing to accept between parameters output by a model and those computed from field data.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Jørgensen, Sven Erik|author2=Bendoricchio, G.|last-author-amp=yes|title=Fundamentals of ecological modelling|publisher=Gulf Professional Publishing|year=2001|isbn=978-0-08-044028-6|page=79|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=geNPWdVBbDYC&amp;pg=PA79}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Pastorok, Robert A.|chapter=Introduction|title=Ecological modeling in risk assessment: chemical effects on populations, ecosystems, and landscapes|publisher=CRC Press|year=2002|isbn=978-1-56670-574-5|page=22|chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=LNdRGbpDWgUC&amp;pg=PA22}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Shifley, S.R.|editor=Millspaugh, Joshua J.|editor2=Thompson, Frank Richard|chapter=Validation of Landscape-Scale Decision Support Models That Predict Vegetation and Wildlife Dynamics|title=Models for planning wildlife conservation in large landscapes|publisher=Academic Press|year=2008|isbn=978-0-12-373631-4|page=419|chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=GLtcJs2f810C&amp;pg=PA419}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Voinov, Alexey|title=Systems Science and Modeling for Ecological Economics|year=2008|publisher=Academic Press|isbn=978-0-12-372583-7|page=131|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Nol8DOt-qe8C&amp;pg=PA131}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Reuter, Hauke|chapter=How Valid Are Model Results?

==Examples==
===The Lotka–Volterra equations===
[[File:Lotka Volterra dynamics.svg|thumb|300px|right|A sample [[Time series|time-series]] of the [[Lotka–Volterra equation|Lotka-Volterra model]].  Note that the two populations exhibit [[Limit cycle|cyclic behaviour]], and that the predator cycle lags behind that of the prey.]]
One of the earliest,&lt;ref&gt;Earlier work on [[smallpox]] by [[Daniel Bernoulli]] and [[human overpopulation]] by [[Thomas Malthus]] predates that of Lotka and Volterra, but is not strictly ecological in nature&lt;/ref&gt; and most well-known, ecological models is the [[predation|predator-prey]] model of [[Alfred J. Lotka]] (1925)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last=Lotka | first=A. J. | year=1925 | title=The Elements of Physical Biology | publisher=Williams &amp; Williams Co., Baltimore, USA }}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Vito Volterra]] (1926).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1038/118558a0 |title=Fluctuations in the Abundance of a Species considered Mathematically |journal=Nature |volume=118 |issue=2972 |pages=558–560 |year=1926 |last1=Volterra |first1=Vito }}&lt;/ref&gt;  This model takes the form of a pair of [[ordinary differential equation]]s, one representing a prey [[species]], the other its predator.

: &lt;math&gt;\frac{dX}{dt} = \alpha . X - \beta . X . Y&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;\frac{dY}{dt} = \gamma . \beta . X . Y - \delta . Y&lt;/math&gt;

where,
&lt;center&gt;
{| style="background-color: transparent; width: 90%"
| width="50%" align="left" valign="top" |
* &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; is the number/concentration of the prey species;
* &lt;math&gt;Y&lt;/math&gt; is the number/concentration of the predator species;
* &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt; is the prey species' growth rate;
| width="50%" align="left" valign="top" |
* &lt;math&gt;\beta&lt;/math&gt; is the predation rate of &lt;math&gt;Y&lt;/math&gt; upon &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt;;
* &lt;math&gt;\gamma&lt;/math&gt; is the [[Assimilation (biology)|assimilation]] efficiency of &lt;math&gt;Y&lt;/math&gt;;
* &lt;math&gt;\delta&lt;/math&gt; is the mortality rate of the predator species
|} &lt;/center&gt;

Volterra originally devised the model to explain fluctuations in [[fish]] and [[shark]] populations observed in the [[Adriatic Sea]] after the [[First World War]] (when [[fishery|fishing]] was curtailed).  However, the equations have subsequently been applied more generally.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last1=Begon | first=M. | last2=Harper | first2=J. L. | last3=Townsend | first3=C. R. | year=1988 | title=Ecology: Individuals, Populations and Communities | publisher=Blackwell Scientific Publications Inc., Oxford, UK | title-link=Ecology: Individuals, Populations and Communities }}&lt;/ref&gt; Although simple, they illustrate some of the salient features of ecological models:  modelled biological [[population]]s experience [[Malthusian growth model|growth]], interact with other populations (as either predators, prey or [[Competitive Lotka-Volterra equations|competitors]]) and suffer [[mortality rate|mortality]].{{Citation needed|date=April 2011}}

A credible, simple alternative to the Lotka-Volterra predator-prey model and its common prey dependent generalizations is the ratio dependent or [[Arditi-Ginzburg equations|Arditi-Ginzburg]] model.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/S0022-5193(89)80211-5 |title=Coupling in predator-prey dynamics: Ratio-Dependence |journal=Journal of Theoretical Biology |volume=139 |issue=3 |pages=311–326 |year=1989 |last1=Arditi |first1=Roger |last2=Ginzburg |first2=Lev R. }}&lt;/ref&gt; The two are the extremes of the spectrum of predator interference models.  According to the authors of the alternative view, the data show that true interactions in nature are so far from the Lotka-Volterra extreme on the interference spectrum that the model can simply be discounted as wrong.  They are much closer to the ratio dependent extreme, so if a simple model is needed one can use the Arditi-Ginzburg model as the first approximation.&lt;ref&gt;Arditi, R. and Ginzburg, L.R.

The [[Theoretical ecology|theoretical ecologist]] [[Robert Ulanowicz]] has used [[information theory]] tools to describe the structure of ecosystems, emphasizing [[mutual information]] (correlations) in studied systems. Drawing on this methodology and prior observations of complex ecosystems, Ulanowicz depicts approaches to determining the stress levels on ecosystems and predicting system reactions to defined types of alteration in their settings (such as increased or reduced energy flow, and [[eutrophication]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Ulanowicz|first=Robert E.|title=Ecology, the Ascendent Perspective|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=jSKDw_zAMJUC&amp;pg=PP1|year=1997|publisher=Columbia University Press|isbn=978-0-231-10829-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{refimprove|date=October 2008}}

The '''efficiency''' of an entity (a [[machine|device]], [[electronic component|component]], or [[system]]) in [[electronics]] and [[electrical engineering]] is defined as useful power output divided by the total electrical power consumed (a [[vulgar fraction|fractional]] [[Expression (mathematics)|expression]]), typically denoted by the [[Greek alphabet|Greek]] small letter [[eta]] (η – ήτα).

: &lt;math&gt;

\mathrm{Efficiency}=\frac{\mathrm{Useful\ power\ output}}{\mathrm{Total\ power\ input}}
&lt;/math&gt;
If energy output and input are expressed in the same units, efficiency is a [[dimensionless number]]. Where it is not customary or convenient to represent input and output energy in the same units, efficiency-like quantities have units associated with them.  For example, the [[heat rate (efficiency)|heat rate]] of a fossil-fuel power plant may be expressed in [[British thermal unit|BTU]] per [[kilowatt-hour]]. [[Luminous efficacy]] of a light source expresses the amount of visible light for a certain amount of power transfer and has the units of [[lumen (unit)|lumens]] per watt.

== Efficiency of typical electrical devices ==

''Efficiency'' should not be confused with ''[[effectiveness]]'': a system that wastes most of its input power but produces exactly what it is meant to is effective but not efficient. The term "efficiency" makes sense only in reference to the wanted effect. A [[light bulb]], for example, might have 2% efficiency at emitting light yet still be 98% efficient at heating a room (In practice it is nearly 100% efficient at heating a room because the light energy will also be converted to heat eventually, apart from the small fraction that leaves through the windows). An [[electronic amplifier]] that delivers 10 watts of power to its load (e.g., a [[loudspeaker]]), while drawing 20 watts of power from a power source is 50% efficient. (10/20 × 100 = 50%)
* Electric kettle: more than 90%{{citation needed|date=October 2014}} (comparatively little heat energy is lost during the 2 to 3 minutes a kettle takes to boil water).
* A premium efficiency electric motor: more than 90% ''(see Main Article: [[Premium efficiency]]).''
* A large power [[transformer]] used in the electrical grid may have efficiency of more than 99%. Early 19th century transformers were much less efficient, wasting up to a third of the energy passing through them.{{Citation needed|date=October 2014}}
* In electrical power generation steam power plant have 30-40 % efficiency.

== Efficiency of devices at point of maximum power transfer ... ==

As a result of the [[maximum power theorem]], devices transfer maximum power to a load when running at 50% electrical efficiency. This occurs when the load resistance (of the device in question) is equal to the internal [[Thévenin's theorem|Thevenin equivalent]] resistance of the power source.  This is valid only for non-reactive source and load impedances.

== Efficiency of light bulbs ==
{{details|Luminous efficacy}}

[[Image:LampEfficiency.JPG|thumb|right|280px|Diagram of efficiency for various types of lamps]]

* [[Incandescent light bulb]]: about 2%.
* [[Compact fluorescent lamp]]: about 7–9%.
* White [[light-emitting diode]] (LED) about 4–18%.

== Discussion ==
{{unreferenced section|date=October 2012}}
High efficiency is particularly relevant in [[system]]s that can operate from [[Battery (electricity)|batteries]]. Inefficiency may require weighing the cost either of the wasted energy, or of the required [[power supply]], against the cost of attaining greater efficiency. Efficiency can usually be improved by choosing different components or by redesigning the system. Inefficiency probably produces extra heat within the system, which must be removed if it is to remain within its [[operating temperature]] range.  In a climate-controlled environment, like a home or office, heat generated by appliances may reduce heating costs or increase air conditioning costs.

This includes analysis and decision making in terms of the expression of emotion, whether actually felt or not, as well as its opposite: the suppression of emotions that are felt but not expressed.

Roles that have been identified as requiring emotional labor include but are not limited to Mother/Wife, those involved in [[public administration]] (especially the palace intrigues of a ruling body, these being an eternal literary theme), guarded professions of secrecy (such as espionage, national security, military intelligence, psychiatry, clerisy, and law), [[flight attendant]], [[Day care|daycare worker]], [[Nursing home care|nursing home worker]], [[Nursing|nurse]], [[Physician|doctor]], [[Cashier|store clerk]], [[Call centre|call center worker]], [[teacher]], [[librarian]], [[social worker]]; most roles in a [[hotel]], [[motel]], [[tavern]], [[bar]], [[pub]], and [[restaurant]]; and jobs in the media, such as television and radio.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |last=Russell Hochschild |first=Arlie |author-link=Arlie Russell Hochschild |contribution=Preface to the 2012 edition |editor-last=Russell Hochschild |editor-first=Arlie |editor-link=Arlie Russell Hochschild |title-link=The Managed Heart: the Commercialization of Human Feeling |title=The managed heart: commercialization of human feeling |page=x |publisher=University of California Press |location=Berkeley |year=2012 |isbn=978-0-520-27294-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; As particular economies move from a [[manufacturing]]- to a [[Tertiary sector of the economy|service-based economy]], more workers in a variety of occupational fields are expected to manage their emotions according to employer demands when compared to sixty years ago.

==Definition: emotional labor versus emotion work==
[[File:Waitress2k7.jpg|thumb|A [[waitress]] at a restaurant is expected to do emotional labor, such as smiling and expressing positive emotion towards customers]]

The [[sociology|sociologist]] [[Arlie Russell Hochschild|Arlie Hochschild]] provides the first definition of emotional labor, which is a form of emotion regulation that creates a publicly visible facial and bodily display within the workplace.&lt;ref name="Hochschild Book" /&gt; The related term [[emotion work]] (also called "emotion management") refers to "these same acts done in a private context", such as within the private sphere of one's home or interactions with [[family]] and [[friendship|friends]]. Hochschild identified three emotion regulation strategies: [[cognitive]], bodily, and expressive.&lt;ref name="Hochschild Article"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Russell Hochschild |first=Arlie |author-link=Arlie Russell Hochschild |title=Emotion work, feeling rules, and social structure |journal=[[American Journal of Sociology]] |volume=85 |issue=3 |pages=551–575 |publisher=[[University of Chicago Press]] |jstor=2778583 |date=November 1979 |ref=harv |doi=10.1086/227049}} [https://campus.fsu.edu/bbcswebdav/institution/academic/social_sciences/sociology/Reading%20Lists/Social%20Psych%20Prelim%20Readings/II.%20Emotions/1979%20Hochschild%20-%20Emotion%20Work.pdf Pdf.]&lt;/ref&gt; Within cognitive emotion work, one attempts to change images, ideas, or thoughts in hopes of changing the feelings associated with them.&lt;ref name="Hochschild Article" /&gt; For example, one may associate a family picture with feeling happy and think about said picture whenever attempting to feel happy. Within bodily emotion work, one attempts to change physical symptoms in order to create a desired [[emotion]].&lt;ref name="Hochschild Article" /&gt; For example, one may attempt deep breathing in order to reduce anger. Within expressive emotion work, one attempts to change expressive gestures to change inner feelings.&lt;ref name="Hochschild Article" /&gt; For example, one may attempt to smile when trying to feel happy. One becomes aware of emotion work most often when one's feelings do not fit the situation. For instance, when one does not feel sad at a funeral, one becomes acutely aware of the feelings appropriate for that situation.&lt;ref name="Hochschild Article" /&gt;

While emotion work happens within the private sphere, emotional labor is emotion management within the workplace according to employer expectations. According to Hochschild (1983), the emotion management by employers creates a situation in which this emotion management can be exchanged in the marketplace.&lt;ref name="Hochschild Book" /&gt; According to Hochschild (1983), [[Job (role)|jobs]] involving emotional labor are defined as those that:

# require face-to-face or voice-to-voice contact with the public.
# require the worker to produce an emotional state in another person.
# allow the employer, through training and supervision, to exercise a degree of control over the emotional activities of employees.&lt;ref name="Hochschild Book" /&gt;

Hochschild (1983) argues that within this [[commodification]] process, service workers are estranged from their own feelings in the workplace.&lt;ref name="Hochschild Book" /&gt;

==Determinants==
# Societal, occupational, and organizational [[Norm (sociology)|norms]]. For example, [[empirical]] evidence indicates that in typically "busy" stores there is more legitimacy to express negative emotions, than there is in typically "slow" stores, in which employees are expected to behave accordingly to the display rules;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Rafaeli |first1=A. |last2=Sutton |first2=R.

# Supervisory regulation of display rules; That is, supervisors are likely to be important definers of display rules at the job level, given their direct influence on worker's beliefs about high-performance expectations. Moreover, supervisors' impressions of the need to suppress negative emotions on the job influence the employees' impressions of that display rule.&lt;ref name="Diefendorff"/&gt;

== Surface and deep acting ==
Original description of this emotion management process, researchers have focused on surface acting and deep acting as the primary strategies that employees use to regulate their emotions. Surface acting involves a "faking" process through which outward expressions are altered, yet internal feelings are left intact (2013).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url= |title=The managed heart: The commercialization of feeling |last=Hochschild |first=A.R. |date=1983 |journal=University of California Press |doi= |pmid= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Conversely, deep acting is an effortful process through which employees change their internal feelings to align with organizational expectations, producing more natural and genuine emotional displays (Grandey et al., 2013)&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite book |title=Emotional labor in the 21st century: Diverse Perspectives on Emotion Regulation at Work |last=Grandy |first=A. |publisher=Routledge |year=2013 |isbn= |location= |pages=3–17 |last2=Diefendorff |first2=J.M. |last3=Rupp |first3=D.}}&lt;/ref&gt; (3). Although the underlying regulatory processes involved in each approach differ, the objective of both, is typically to show positive emotions, which are presumed to impact the feelings of customers and bottom-line outcomes (e.g., sales, positive recommendations, and repeat business; Pugh, 2001; Tsai, 2001).&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Pugh, S.

==Careers==
[[File:Altenpflegerin D1824.jpg|thumb|A [[nurse]] working in a hospital, is expected to express positive emotions towards patients, such as warmth and compassion.]]

In the past, emotional labor demands and display rules were viewed as a characteristic of particular [[wikt:occupation|occupations]], such as [[waiting staff|restaurant workers]], [[cashier]]s, [[hospital]] workers, bill collectors, [[Licensed Professional Counselor|counselors]], [[secretary|secretaries]], and nurses. However, display rules have been conceptualized not only as [[role]] requirements of particular occupational groups, but also as [[interpersonal]] job demands, which are shared by many kinds of occupations.&lt;ref name="Diefendorff"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Diefendorff |first1=J. M. |last2=Richard |first2=E.

=== Bill collectors ===
In 1991, Sutton did an in-depth [[Qualitative research|qualitative]] study into bill collectors at a [[collection agency]].&lt;ref name="sutton"&gt;{{cite journal |first=Robert I. |last=Sutton |year=1991 |title=Maintaining norms about expressed emotions: The case of bill collectors |journal=[[Administrative Science Quarterly]] |issue=2 |volume=36 |pages=245–268 |jstor=2393355 |doi=10.2307/2393355 |url=https://dx.doi.org/10.2307/2393355}}&lt;/ref&gt; He found that unlike the other jobs described here where employees need to act cheerful and concerned, bill collectors are selected and [[socialized]] to show irritation to most [[debtor]]s.  Specifically, the collection agency hired agents who seemed to be easily aroused. The newly hired agents were then trained on when and how to show varying emotions to different types of debtors.  As they worked at the collection agency, they were closely monitored by their supervisors to make sure that they frequently conveyed urgency to debtors.

Bill collectors' emotional labor consists of not letting angry and hostile debtors make them angry and to not feel guilty about pressuring friendly debtors for money.&lt;ref name="sutton" /&gt; They coped with angry debtors by publicly showing their anger or making jokes when they got off the phone.&lt;ref name="sutton" /&gt; They minimized the guilt they felt by staying emotionally detached from the debtors.&lt;ref name="sutton" /&gt;

=== Food-industry workers ===

====Wait staff====
[[File:Waitress taking an order.jpg|thumb|A waitress taking an order in an American restaurant]]

In her 1991 study of [[waitresses]] in [[Philadelphia]], Paules examines how these workers assert control and protect their [[self identity]] during interactions with [[customers]]. In [[restaurant]] work, Paules argues, workers' subordination to customers is reinforced through "[[cultural]] symbols that originate from deeply rooted assumptions about [[service sector|service work]]." Because the waitresses were not strictly regulated by their [[employers]], waitresses' interactions with customers were controlled by the waitresses themselves. Although they are stigmatized by the [[stereotypes]] and assumptions of servitude surrounding restaurant work, the waitresses studied were not negatively affected by their interactions with customers. To the contrary, they viewed their ability to manage their emotions as a valuable skill that could be used to gain control over customers. Thus, the Philadelphia waitresses took advantage of the lack of employer-regulated emotional labor in order to avoid the potentially negative consequences of emotional labor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Paules|first=G.F.|title=Dishing it out: power and resistance among waitresses in a New Jersey restaurant|year=1991|publisher=Temple University|location=Philadelphia, PA|isbn=9780877228875}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Though Paules highlights the positive consequences of emotional labor for a specific population of waitresses, other scholars have also found negative consequences of emotional labor within the waitressing industry. Through eighteen months of [[participant observation]] research, Bayard De Volo (2003) found that [[casino]] waitresses are highly monitored and monetarily bribed to perform emotional labor in the workplace.&lt;ref name="Casino Waitress"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Bayard De Volo |first=L |title=Service and surveillance: infrapolitics at work among casino cocktail waitresses |journal=[[Social Politics|Social Politics: International Studies in Gender, State &amp; Society]] |year=2003 |volume=10 |issue=3 |pages=346–376 |doi=10.1093/sp/jxg019 |url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1093/sp/jxg019 }} [https://muse.jhu.edu/login?auth=0&amp;type=summary&amp;url=/journals/social_politics/v010/10.3de_volo.html Article at Project MUSE.]&lt;/ref&gt; Specifically, Bayard De Volo (2003) argues that through a sexualized environment and a generous [[Tip (gratuity)|tipping system]], both casino owners and customers control waitresses' [[behavior]] and [[Human physical appearance|appearance]] for their own benefit and pleasure. Even though the waitresses have their own forms of individual and collective resistance mechanisms, intense and consistent monitoring of their actions by casino management makes it difficult to change the power dynamics of the casino workplace.&lt;ref name="Casino Waitress" /&gt;

====Fast-food employees====
By using participant observation and [[interview]]s, Leidner (1993) examines how employers in fast food restaurants regulate workers' interactions with customers.&lt;ref name="Fast Food Book"&gt;{{cite book|last=Leidner|first=Robin|title=Fast food, fast talk: service work and the routinization of everyday life|publisher=University of California Press|isbn=9780520085008}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Leidner (1993), employers attempt to regulate workers' interactions with customers only under certain conditions. Specifically, when employers attempt to regulate worker-customer interactions, employers believe that "the quality of the interaction is important to the success of the enterprise", that workers are "unable or unwilling to conduct the interactions appropriately on their own", and that the "tasks themselves are not too complex or context-dependent."&lt;ref name="Fast Food Book" /&gt; According to Leidner (1993), regulating employee interactions with customers involves standardizing workers' personal interactions with customers. At the [[McDonald's]] fast food restaurants in Leidner's (1993) study, these interactions are strictly scripted, and workers' compliance with the scripts and regulations are closely monitored.&lt;ref name="Fast Food Book" /&gt;

Along with examining employers' attempts to regulate employee-customer interactions, Leidner (1993) examines how fast-food workers' respond to these regulations.&lt;ref name="Fast Food Book" /&gt; According to Leidner (1993), meeting employers' expectations requires workers to engage in some form of emotional labor. For example, McDonald's workers are expected to greet customers with a [[smile]] and friendly attitude independent of their own [[mood (psychology)|mood]] or [[temperament]] at the time. Leidner (1993) suggests that rigid compliance with these expectations is at least potentially damaging to workers' sense of self and [[Identity (social science)|identity]]. However, Leidner (1993) did not see the negative consequences of emotional labor in the workers she studied. Instead, McDonald's workers attempted to individualize their responses to customers in small ways. Specifically, they used [[humor]] or [[exaggeration]] to demonstrate their rebellion against the strict regulation of their employee-customer interactions.&lt;ref name="Fast Food Book" /&gt;

===Physicians===
According to Larson and Yao (2005), [[empathy]] should characterize physicians' interactions with their patients because, despite advancement in medical [[technology]], the interpersonal relationship between [[physicians]] and [[patients]] remains essential to quality [[healthcare]].&lt;ref name=Physicians&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Larson |first1=E.B. |last2=Yao |first2=X. |title=Clinical empathy as emotional labor in the patient-physician relationship |journal=[[JAMA (journal)|The Journal of the American Medical Association]] |year=2005 |volume=293 |issue=9 |pages=1100–1106 |pmid=15741532 |doi=10.1001/jama.293.9.1100 |url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1001/jama.293.9.1100}}&lt;/ref&gt; Larson and Yao (2005) argue that physicians consider empathy a form of emotional labor. Specifically, according to Larson and Yao (2005), physicians engage in emotional labor through deep acting by feeling sincere empathy before, during, and after interactions with patients. On the other hand, Larson and Yao (2005) argue that physicians engage in surface acting when they fake empathic behaviors toward the patient. Although Larson and Yao (2005) argue that deep acting is preferred, physicians may rely on surface acting when sincere empathy for patients is impossible. Overall, Larson and Yao (2005) argue that physicians are more effective and enjoy more professional [[contentment|satisfaction]] when they engage in empathy through deep acting due to emotional labor.&lt;ref name=Physicians /&gt;

===Police work===
According to Martin (1999), [[police]] work involves substantial amounts of emotional labor by officers, who must control their own facial and bodily displays of emotion in the presence of other [[officers]] and [[citizens]].&lt;ref name="Police Officers"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Martin |first=S.E. |title=Police force or police service? Gender and emotional labor |journal=[[American Academy of Political and Social Science#The Annals|The Annals of the American Academy of Political and Social Science]] |year=1999 |volume=561 |issue=1 |jstor=1049285 |doi=10.1177/000271629956100108 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Although policing is often viewed as stereotypically [[masculine]] work that focuses on fighting [[crime]], policing also requires officers to maintain order and provide a variety of interpersonal services. For example, police must have a commanding presence that allows them to act decisively and maintain control in unpredictable situations while having the ability to actively listen and talk to citizens. According to Martin (1999), a police officer who displays too much [[anger]], [[sympathy]], or other emotion while dealing with danger on the job will be viewed by other officers as someone unable to withstand the pressures of police work, due to the [[sexist]] views of many police officers.&lt;ref name="Police Officers" /&gt; While being able to balance this self-management of emotions in front of other officers, police must also assertively restore order and use effective interpersonal skills to gain citizen [[trust (social sciences)|trust]] and [[Compliance (psychology)|compliance]]. Ultimately, the ability of police officers to effectively engage in emotional labor affects how other officers and citizens view them.&lt;ref name="Police Officers" /&gt;

===Public administration ===
Many scholars argue that the amount of emotional work required between all levels of government is greatest on the local level. It is at the level of cities and counties that the responsibility lies for day to day emergency preparedness, firefighters, law enforcement, public education, public health, and family and children's services. Citizens in a community expect the same level of satisfaction from their government, as they receive in a [[customer service]]-oriented job. This takes a considerate amount of work for both employees and employers in the field of public administration. There are two comparisons that represent emotional labor within public administration, "Rational Work versus Emotion Work", and "Emotional Labor versus Emotional Intelligence."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Emotional Labor- Putting the Service in Public Service |last=Guy |first=Mary |publisher=M.E. Sharpe |year=2008 |isbn=978-0-7656-2117-7 |location=New York |pages=6–7 |last2=Newman |first2=Meredith |last3=Mastracci |first3=Sharon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Performance====

When public administrators perform emotional labor, many scholars argue administrators are dealing with significantly more sensitive situations than employees in the service industry. The reason for this is because they are on the front lines of the government, and are expected to by citizens to serve them quickly and efficiently. When confronted by a citizen or a co-worker public administrators use emotional sensing to size up the emotional state of the citizen in need. Workers then take stock of their own emotional state in order to make sure that the emotion they are expressing is appropriate to their roles. Simultaneously, they have to determine how to act in order to elicit the desired response from the citizen as well as from co-workers. Public Administrators perform emotional labor through five different strategies: Psychological First Aid, Compartments and Closets, Crazy Calm, Humor, and Common Sense.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Emotional Labor and Crisis Response, Working on a Razor's Edge|last=Mastracci|first=Sharron H.|publisher=M.E. Sharpe|year=2012|isbn=|location=Armonk, New York|pages=20–36}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Definition: rational work vs. emotion work ====
According to Mary Guy, Public administration does not only focus on the business side of administration but also on the personal side as well. It is not just about collecting the water bill or land ordinances to construct a new property, it is also about the quality of life and sense of community that is allotted to individuals by their city officials. Rational work is the ability to think cognitively and analytically, while emotional work means to think more practically and with more reason.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Emotional Labor- Putting the Service in Public Service |last=Guy |first=Mary |publisher=M.E. Sharpe |year=2008 |isbn=978-0-7656-2117-7 |location=New York |pages=63 |last2=Newman |last3=Mastracci |first2=Meredith |first3=Sharon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Definition: vs. emotional intelligence ====
Knowing how to suppress and manage one's own feelings is known as [[emotional intelligence]], the ability to control one's emotions and to be able to do this at a high level guarantees one's own ability to serve those in need. Emotional intelligence is performed while performing emotional labor, and without one the other can not be there.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Public Service |last=Guy |first=Mary |publisher=M.E. Sharpe |year=2008 |isbn=978-0-7656-2117-7 |location=New York |pages=64–65 |last2=Newman |first2=Meredith |last3=Mastracci |first3=Sharon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Gender==
Macdonald and Sirianni (1996) use the term "emotional proletariat" to describe [[Tertiary sector of the economy|service jobs]] in which "workers exercise emotional labor wherein they are required to display friendliness and [[deference]] to customers."&lt;ref name="Gender Book"&gt;{{citation |last1=Macdonald |first1=Cameron L. |last2=Sirianni |first2=Carmen |contribution=The service society and the changing experience of work |editor1-last=Macdonald |editor1-first=Cameron L. |editor2-last=Sirianni |editor2-first=Carmen |title=In working in the service society |year=1996 |pages=1–28 |publisher=Temple University Press |isbn=978-1-56639-480-2 |ref=harv |postscript=.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because of deference, these occupations tend to be stereotyped as female jobs, independent of the actual number of women working the job. According to Macdonald and Sirianni (1996), because deference is a characteristic demanded of all those in [[disadvantaged]] structural positions, especially women, when deference is made a job requirement, women are likely to be overrepresented in these jobs. Macdonald and Sirianni (1996) claim that "[i]n no other area of wage labor are the personal characteristics of the workers so strongly associated with the nature of the work."&lt;ref name="Gender Book" /&gt; Thus, according to Macdonald and Sirianna (1996), although all workers employed within the service economy may have a difficult time maintaining their [[dignity]] and self-identity due to the demands of emotional labor, such an issue may be especially problematic for women workers.&lt;ref name="Gender Book" /&gt;

Emotional labor also affects women by perpetuating [[occupational segregation]] and the [[gender wage gap]].&lt;ref name="Gender Article"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Guy|first1=Mary Ellen|last2=Newman|first2=Meredith A.|date=|year=2004|title=Women's jobs, men's jobs: sex segregation and emotional labor|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1540-6210.2004.00373.x|journal=[[Public Administration Review]]|volume=64|issue=3|pages=289–298|doi=10.1111/j.1540-6210.2004.00373.x|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Job segregation, which is the systematic tendency for men and women to work in different occupations, is often cited as the reason why women lack equal pay when compared to men. According to Guy and Newman (2004), occupational segregation and ultimately the gender wage gap can at least be partially attributed to emotional labor. Specifically, work-related tasks that require emotional work thought to be natural for women, such as caring and [[empathy|empathizing]] are requirements of many female-dominated occupations. However, according to Guy and Newman (2004), these feminized work tasks are not a part of formal job descriptions and performance evaluations: "Excluded from job descriptions and performance evaluations, the work is invisible and uncompensated. Public service relies heavily on such skills, yet civil service systems, which are designed on the assumptions of a bygone era, fail to acknowledge and compensate emotional labor." According to Guy and Newman (2004), women working in positions that require emotion labour in addition to regular work are not compensated for this additional labour because of the sexist notion that the additional labour is to be expected of them by the fact of being a woman. This suggests that Guy and Newman believe a man conducting emotional labour would be compensated more than a woman would, however, if women are inproportionately hired for positions requiring emotional work, that does not immediately explain a wage gap comparable to men.

==Implications==

Positive affective display in service interactions, such as [[smiling]] and conveying friendliness, are positively associated with customer positive feelings,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Pugh |first1=S.D. |year=2001 |title=Service with a smile: emotional contagion in the service encounter |jstor=3069445 |journal=[[Academy of Management Journal]] |volume=44 |issue=5 |pages=1018–1027 |doi=10.2307/3069445}}&lt;/ref&gt; and important outcomes, such as intention to return, intention to recommend a store to others, and perception of overall service quality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Parasuraman |first1=A. |last2=Zeithaml |first2=V.A. |last3=Berry |first3=L.L. |date=Spring 1988 |title=SERVQUAL: a multiple-item scale for measuring customer perceptions of service quality |url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/journal/00224359/70 |journal=Journal of Retailing |volume=64 |issue=1 |pages=12–40 }} [http://areas.kenan-flagler.unc.edu/Marketing/FacultyStaff/zeithaml/Selected%20Publications/SERVQUAL-%20A%20Multiple-Item%20Scale%20for%20Measuring%20Consumer%20Perceptions%20of%20Service%20Quality.pdf Pdf.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304063550/http://areas.kenan-flagler.unc.edu/Marketing/FacultyStaff/zeithaml/Selected%20Publications/SERVQUAL-%20A%20Multiple-Item%20Scale%20for%20Measuring%20Consumer%20Perceptions%20of%20Service%20Quality.pdf |date=2016-03-04 }}&lt;/ref&gt; There is evidence that emotional labor may lead to employees' [[emotional exhaustion]] and [[burnout (psychology)|burnout]] over time, and may also reduce employees' [[job satisfaction]]. That is, higher degree of using emotion regulation on the job is related to higher levels of employees' emotional exhaustion,&lt;ref name="grandey_2005"/&gt; and lower levels of employees' job satisfaction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Brotheridge |first1=C. M. |last2=Grandey |first2=A. A. |year=2002 |title=Emotional labor and burnout: Comparing two perspectives of people work |work=Journal of Vocational Behavior |volume=60|publisher=Aop.psy.unibe.ch |url=http://www.aop.psy.unibe.ch/lehre/proseminar_burnout/9_23.05.07%20Brotheridge%20Grandey%202002.pdf |format=PDF |doi=10.1006/jvbe.2001.1815 |pages=17–39}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There is empirical evidence that higher levels of emotional labor demands are not uniformly rewarded with higher wages. Rather, the reward is dependent on the level of general cognitive demands required by the job. That is, occupations with high cognitive demands evidence wage returns with increasing emotional labor demands; whereas occupations low in cognitive demands evidence a wage "penalty" with increasing emotional labor demands.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Glomb |first1=T.M. |last2=Kammeyer-Mueller |first2=J. |last3=Rotundo |first3=M. |year=2004 |title=Emotional labor demands and compensating wage differentials |work=[[Journal of Applied Psychology]] |volume=89 |pages=700–714 |doi=10.1037/0021-9010.89.4.700 |url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1037/0021-9010.89.4.700 |pmid=15327355 }} [http://faculty.washington.edu/mdj3/MGMT580/Readings/Week%206/Glomb.pdf Pdf.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090220022147/http://faculty.washington.edu/mdj3/MGMT580/Readings/Week%206/Glomb.pdf |date=2009-02-20 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Coping skills===
[[Coping (psychology)|Coping]] occurs in response to psychological stress—usually triggered by changes—in an effort to maintain mental health and emotional well-being. Life stressors are often described as negative events (loss of a job). However, positive changes in life (a new job) can also constitute life stressors, thus requiring the use of coping skills to adapt. Coping strategies are the behaviors, thoughts, and emotions that you use to adjust to the changes that occur in your life.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.semel.ucla.edu/dual-diagnosis-program/News_and_Resources/How_Do_You_Cope |title=How Do You Cope |date= |accessdate=November 20, 2015 |website=ucla.edu |publisher=UCLA |last= |first=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The use of coping skills will help a person better themselves in the work place and perform to the best of their ability to achieve success. There are many ways to cope and adapt to changes. Some ways include: sharing emotions with peers, having a healthy social life outside of work, being humorous, and adjusting expectations of self and work. These coping skills will help turn negative emotion to positive and allow for more focus on the public in contrast to oneself.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Diefendorff|first=J|last2=Gosserand|first2=R|date=2003|title=Understanding the emotional labor process: A control theory perspective|url=|journal=Journal of Organizational Behavior|volume=24|pages=945–959|doi=10.1002/job.230|pmid=}}&lt;!--|access-date=November 20, 2015 --&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Encyclopédie, ou dictionnaire raisonné des sciences, des arts et des métiers''''' (English: ''Encyclopedia, or a Systematic Dictionary of the Sciences, Arts, and Crafts''),&lt;ref&gt;Ian Buchanan, ''A Dictionary of Critical Theory'', Oxford University Press, 2010, p. 151.&lt;/ref&gt; better known as '''''Encyclopédie''''', was a general [[encyclopedia]] published in [[France]] between 1751 and 1772, with later supplements, revised editions, and translations. It had many writers, known as the [[Encyclopédistes]]. It was edited by [[Denis Diderot]] and, until 1759, co-edited by [[Jean le Rond d'Alembert]].

The ''Encyclopédie'' is most famous for representing the thought of the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]]. According to Denis Diderot in the article "Encyclopédie", the ''Encyclopédie'''s aim was "to change the way people think" and for people to be able to inform themselves and to know things.&lt;ref&gt;Denis Diderot as quoted in Hunt, p. 611&lt;/ref&gt; He and the other contributors advocated for the [[secularization]] of learning away from the [[Jesuits]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=University of the State of New York|title=Annual Report of the Regents, Volume 106|pages=266|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ABxEAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA266&amp;lpg=PA266}}&lt;/ref&gt; Diderot wanted to incorporate all of the world's knowledge into the ''Encyclopédie'' and hoped that the text could disseminate all this information to the public and future generations.&lt;ref&gt;Denis Diderot as quoted in Kramnick, p. 17.&lt;/ref&gt;

It was also the first encyclopedia to include contributions from many named contributors, and it was the first general encyclopedia to describe the [[Artes Mechanicae|mechanical arts]]. In the first publication, seventeen folio volumes were accompanied by detailed engravings. Later volumes were published without the engravings, in order to better reach a wide audience within Europe.&lt;ref&gt;Lyons, M. (2013). ''Books: a living history''. London: Thames &amp; Hudson.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origins==
The ''Encyclopédie'' was originally conceived as a French translation of [[Ephraim Chambers]]'s ''[[Cyclopaedia, or Universal Dictionary of Arts and Sciences|Cyclopaedia]]'' (1728).&lt;ref name=autogenerated2&gt;Magee, p. 124&lt;/ref&gt; Ephraim Chambers had first published his ''[[Cyclopaedia, or an Universal Dictionary of Arts and Sciences]]'' in two volumes in London in 1728, following several dictionaries of arts and sciences that had emerged in Europe since the late 17th century.&lt;ref&gt;Lough (1971. pp. 3–5)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="RS 1970"&gt;[[Robert Shackleton]] "[https://books.google.com/books?id=qEwLAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA390 The ''Encyclopedie'']" in: ''Proceedings, American Philosophical Society'' (vol. 114, No. 5, 1970. p. 39)&lt;/ref&gt; This work became quite renowned, and four editions were published between 1738 and 1742. An Italian translation appeared between 1747 and 1754. In France a member of the banking family Lambert had started translating Chambers into French,&lt;ref&gt;''Précis de la vie du citoyen Lambert'', Bibliothèque nationale, Ln. 11217; Listed in Shackleton (1970, p. 130).&lt;/ref&gt; but in 1745 the expatriate Englishman [[John Mills (encyclopedist)|John Mills]] and German [[Gottfried Sellius]] were the first to actually prepare a French edition of Ephraim Chambers's ''Cyclopaedia'' for publication, which they entitled ''Encyclopédie''.

Early in 1745 a prospectus for the ''Encyclopédie''&lt;ref&gt;Recently rediscovered in the ''[[Bibliothèque nationale de France]]'', see [http://blog.bnf.fr/lecteurs/index.php/2010/12/prospectus-pour-une-traduction-francaise-de-la-cyclopaedia-de-chambers/ Prospectus pour une traduction française de la Cyclopaedia de Chambers] blog.bnf.fr, Dec. 2010&lt;/ref&gt; was published to attract subscribers to the project. This four page prospectus was illustrated by Jean-Michel Papillon,&lt;ref&gt;[[André-François Le Breton]], Jean-Michel Papillon, Ephraim Chambers. ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=-4AxtwAACAAJ Encyclopédie, ou Dictionnaire universel des arts et des sciences]''. 1745&lt;/ref&gt; and accompanied by a plan, stating that the work would be published in five volumes from June 1746 until the end of 1748.&lt;ref&gt;Reproduction from 1745 original in: Luneau de Boisjermain (1771) ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=dIdYAAAAcAAJ&amp;pg=PA165 Mémoire pour les libraires associés à l'Encyclopédie: contre le sieur Luneau de Boisjermain].'' p. 165.&lt;/ref&gt; The text was translated by Mills and Sellius, and it was corrected by an unnamed person, who appears to have been [[Denis Diderot]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Philipp Blom]]. ''Encyclopédie: the triumph of reason in an unreasonable age Fourth Estate'', 2004. p. 37&lt;/ref&gt;

The prospectus was reviewed quite positively and cited at some length in several journals.&lt;ref&gt;"[https://books.google.com/books?id=9OMTAAAAQAAJ&amp;pg=PA70 Prospectus du Dictionnaire de Chambers, traduit en François, et proposé par souscription]" in: M. Desfontaines. ''Jugemens sur quelques ouvrages nouveaux.'' Vol 8. (1745). p. 72&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Mémoires pour l'histoire des sciences et des beaux arts'' journal was lavish in its praise: "voici deux des plus fortes entreprises de Littérature qu'on ait faites depuis long-temps" (here are two of the greatest efforts undertaken in literature in a very long time).&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=eX9KAAAAcAAJ&amp;pg=PA934 Review] in: ''Mémoires pour l'histoire des sciences et des beaux arts'', May 1745, Nr. 2. pp. 934–38&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Mercure Journal'' in June 1745, printed a 25-page article that specifically praised Mill's role as translator; the ''Journal'' introduced Mills as an English scholar who had been raised in France and who spoke both French and English as a native. The ''Journal'' reported that Mills had discussed the work with several academics, was zealous about the project, had devoted his fortune to support this enterprise, and was the sole owner of the publishing privilege.&lt;ref&gt;''Mercure Journal'' (1745, p. 87) cited in: Lough (1971), p. 20.&lt;/ref&gt;

However, the cooperation fell apart later on in 1745. [[André Le Breton]], the publisher commissioned to manage the physical production and sales of the volumes, cheated Mills out of the subscription money, claiming for example that Mills's knowledge of French was inadequate. In a confrontation Le Breton physically assaulted Mills. Mills took Le Breton to court, but the court decided in Le Breton's favour. Mills returned to England soon after the court's ruling.&lt;ref&gt;Mills' summary of this matter was published in [[:fr:Pierre-Joseph Luneau de Boisjermain|Boisjermain]]'s ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=wRhBAAAAcAAJ&amp;pg=PA162 Mémoire pour P. J. F. Luneau de Boisjermain av. d. Piéc. justif]'' 1771, pp. 162–63, where Boisjermain also gave his version of the events (pp. 2–5).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Comments by Le Breton are published in his biography; in the preface of the encyclopedia; in John Lough (1971); etc.&lt;/ref&gt; For his new editor, Le Breton settled on the mathematician [[Jean Paul de Gua de Malves]]. Among those hired by Malves were the young [[Étienne Bonnot de Condillac]], [[Jean le Rond d'Alembert]], and [[Denis Diderot]]. Within thirteen months, in August 1747, Gua de Malves was fired for being an ineffective leader. Le Breton then hired Diderot and d'Alembert to be the new editors.&lt;ref&gt;Blom, pp. 39–40&lt;/ref&gt; Diderot would remain as editor for the next twenty-five years, seeing the ''Encyclopédie'' through to its completion; d'Alembert would leave this role in 1758. As d'Alembert worked on the ''Encyclopédie'', its title expanded. As of 1750, the full title was ''Encyclopédie, ou Dictionnaire raisonné des sciences, des arts et des métiers, par une société de gens de lettres, mis en ordre par M. Diderot de l'Académie des Sciences et Belles-Lettres de Prusse, et quant à la partie mathématique, par M. d'Alembert de l'Académie royale des Sciences de Paris, de celle de Prusse et de la Société royale de Londres.'' ("Encyclopedia: or a Systematic Dictionary of the Sciences, Arts, and Crafts, by a Company of Persons of Letters, edited by M. Diderot of the Academy of Sciences and ''[[Belles-lettres]]'' of Prussia: as to the Mathematical Portion, arranged by M. d'Alembert of the Royal Academy of Sciences of Paris, to the Academy of Sciences in Prussia and to the Royal Society of London.") The title page was amended as d'Alembert acquired more titles.

==Publication==
[[File:Encyclopedie frontispice section 256px.jpg|thumb|Extract from the [[Book frontispiece|frontispiece]] of the ''Encyclopédie'' (1772). It was drawn by [[Charles-Nicolas Cochin]] and engraved by Bonaventure-Louis Prévost. The work is laden with [[symbol]]ism: The figure in the centre represents truth—surrounded by bright light (the central symbol of the Enlightenment). Two other figures on the right, reason and philosophy, are tearing the veil from truth.]]
The work consisted of 28 volumes, with 71,818 articles and 3,129 illustrations. The first seventeen volumes were published between 1751 and 1765; eleven volumes of plates were finished by 1772. Engraver [[Robert Bénard]] provided at least 1,800 plates for the work. Because of its occasional radical contents (see "Contents" below), the ''Encyclopédie'' caused much controversy in conservative circles, and on the initiative of the [[Joseph Omer Joly de Fleury#Opposition to the Encyclopédie|Parlement of Paris]], the French government suspended the encyclopedia's ''privilège'' in 1759.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;Magee, p. 125&lt;/ref&gt; Despite the suspension, work continued "in secret," partially because the project had highly placed supporters, such as [[Guillaume-Chrétien de Lamoignon de Malesherbes|Malesherbes]] and [[Madame de Pompadour]]. The authorities deliberately ignored the continued work; they thought their official ban was sufficient to appease the church and other enemies of the project.

During the "secretive" period, Diderot accomplished a well-known work of subterfuge. The title pages of volumes 1 through 7, published between 1751 and 1757, claimed Paris as the place of publication. However, the title pages of the subsequent text volumes, 8 through 17, published together in 1765, show Neufchastel as the place of publication. Neufchastel (now Neuchâtel) is safely across the French border in what is now part Switzerland but which was then an independent principality,&lt;ref&gt;Matheson, D (1992) ''Postcompulsory Education in Suisse romande'', unpublished PhD thesis, University of Glasgow&lt;/ref&gt; where official production of the ''Encyclopédie'' was secure from interference by agents of the French state. In particular, regime opponents of the ''Encyclopédie'' could not seize the production plates for the ''Encyclopédie'' in Paris because those printing plates ostensibly existed only in Switzerland. Meanwhile, the actual production of volumes 8 through 17 quietly continued in Paris.

In 1775, [[Charles Joseph Panckoucke]] obtained the rights to reissue the work. He issued five volumes of supplementary material and a two-volume index from 1776 to 1780. Some scholars include these seven "extra" volumes as part of the first full issue of the ''Encyclopédie'', for a total of 35 volumes, although they were not written or edited by the original authors.

&lt;!-- info taken from the French article --&gt;From 1782 to 1832, Panckoucke and his successors published an expanded edition of the work in some 166 volumes as the ''[[Encyclopédie méthodique]]''. That work, enormous for its time, occupied a thousand workers in production and 2,250 contributors.&lt;!-- From where this is it refers to the EM, but elsewhere the ''Encyclopédie''. Remove for now: The run of the press was 4,250 copies — a ridiculously small number for the present but very large for the 18th century where editions rarely exceeded 1,500 copies. --&gt;

==Contributors==
Since the objective of the editors of the ''Encyclopédie'' was to gather all the knowledge in the world, Diderot and D'Alembert knew they would need various contributors to help them with their project.&lt;ref&gt;Brewer 2011, p. 56.&lt;/ref&gt; Many of the [[philosophes]] ([[intellectuals]] of the French [[The Enlightenment|Enlightenment]]) contributed to the ''Encyclopédie'', including Diderot himself, [[Voltaire]], [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau|Rousseau]], and [[Charles de Secondat, baron de Montesquieu|Montesquieu]].&lt;ref name=autogenerated2 /&gt; The most prolific contributor was [[Louis de Jaucourt]], who wrote 17,266 articles between 1759 and 1765, or about eight per day, representing a full 25% of the ''Encyclopédie''. The publication became a place where these contributors could share their ideas and interests.

Still, as [[Frank Kafker]] has argued, the Encyclopedists were not a unified group:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.camargofoundation.org/fellowdetails_new05.asp?recno=357 |title=Fellow Project Details |publisher=The Camargo Foundation |date= |accessdate=March 26, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|... despite their reputation, [the Encyclopedists] were not a close-knit group of [[Radicalization|radicals]] intent on subverting the Old Regime in France. Instead they were a disparate group of men of letters, physicians, scientists, craftsmen and scholars ... even the small minority who were persecuted for writing articles belittling what they viewed as unreasonable customs—thus weakening the might of the Catholic Church and undermining that of the monarchy—did not envision that their ideas would encourage a revolution.}}

Following is a list of notable contributors with their area of contribution (for a more detailed list, see [[Encyclopédistes]]):

*[[Jean Le Rond d'Alembert]] – editor; science (especially mathematics), contemporary affairs, philosophy, religion, among others
*[[Claude Bourgelat]] – manège, farriery
*[[André Le Breton]] – chief publisher; article on printer's ink &lt;!--to be noted elsewhere: he was the only person to have participated for the entire duration of the project.--&gt;
*[[Louis-Jean-Marie Daubenton]] – natural history
*[[Denis Diderot]] – chief editor; economics, mechanical arts, philosophy, politics, religion, among others
*[[Baron d'Holbach]] – science (chemistry, mineralogy), politics, religion, among others
*[[Louis de Jaucourt|Chevalier Louis de Jaucourt]] – economics, literature, medicine, politics, bookbinding, among others
*[[Jean-Baptiste de La Chapelle]] – mathematics
*[[Abbé]] [[André Morellet]] – theology, philosophy
*[[Charles de Secondat, Baron de Montesquieu|Montesquieu]] – part of the article "Goût" ("Taste")
*[[François Quesnay]] – articles on tax farmers and grain
*[[Jean-Jacques Rousseau]] – music, political theory
*[[Anne Robert Jacques Turgot, Baron de Laune]] – economics, etymology, philosophy, physics
*[[Voltaire]] – history, literature, philosophy

Due to the controversial nature of some of the articles, several of its editors went to jail.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Brown|first1=Ian|title=An Encyclopedia Brown story: Bound and determined to fight for the facts in the time of Trump|url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/arts/books-and-media/an-encyclopedia-ian-brown-story/article35586033/|accessdate=8 July 2017|work=[[The Globe and Mail]]|date=8 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Contents and controversies ==

===Structure===
[[File:ENC SYSTEME FIGURE.jpeg|300px|thumb|Fig. 3: "[[Figurative system of human knowledge]]", the structure that the ''Encyclopédie'' organised knowledge into. It had three main branches: memory, reason, and imagination.]] Like most encyclopedias, the ''Encyclopédie'' attempted to collect and summarize human knowledge in a variety of fields and topics, ranging from philosophy to theology to science and the arts. The ''Encyclopédie'' was controversial for reorganizing knowledge based on [[humanism|human]] [[rationalism|reason]] instead of by nature or theology.&lt;ref&gt;Darnton, pp. 7,  539&lt;/ref&gt; Knowledge and intellect branched from the three categories of human thought, whereas all other perceived aspects of knowledge, including theology, were simply branches or components of these man made categories.&lt;ref&gt;Brewer 1993, pp. 18–23&lt;/ref&gt; The introduction to the ''Encyclopédie'', D'Alembert's "[[Preliminary Discourse]]", is considered an important exposition of Enlightenment ideals.  Among other things, it presents a [[Figurative system of human knowledge|taxonomy of human knowledge]] (see Fig. 3), which was inspired by [[Francis Bacon]]'s ''[[The Advancement of Learning]]''. The three main branches of knowledge are: "Memory"/History, "Reason"/Philosophy, and "Imagination"/Poetry. This tree of knowledge was created to help readers evaluate the usefulness of the content within the ''Encyclopédie'', and to organize its content.&lt;ref&gt;Brewer 2011, p. 54&lt;/ref&gt; Notable is the fact that theology is ordered under "Philosophy" and that "Knowledge of God" is only a few nodes away from "[[Divination]]" and "[[Black Magic]]".

===Religious and political controversies===
The authors of the ''Encyclopédie'' challenged religious authority. The authors, especially Diderot and d'Alembert, located religion within a system of reason and philosophy. They did not reject all religious claims, but believed theology and notions of [[God]] must be proven. [[Louis de Jaucourt]] therefore harshly criticized superstition as an intellectual error in his article on the topic.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | last = Josephson-Storm | first = Jason | title = The Myth of Disenchantment: Magic, Modernity, and the Birth of the Human Sciences | location = Chicago | publisher = University of Chicago Press | date = 2017 |pages = 51–2 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=xZ5yDgAAQBAJ | isbn = 0-226-40336-X }}&lt;/ref&gt; The writers emphasized an individual’s right to religious sovereignty.&lt;ref name="Lough, p. 196"&gt;Lough, p. 196&lt;/ref&gt; They therefore doubted the authenticity of presupposed historical events cited in the Bible and questioned the validity of miracles and the Resurrection.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Lyons|first=Martyn|title=Books: A Living story|date=2011|publisher=Getty Publications|location=Los Angeles|isbn=978-1-60606-083-4|page=106}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, some contemporary scholars argue the skeptical view of miracles in the ''Encyclopédie'' may be interpreted in terms of "[[Protestant]] debates about the cessation of the charismata."&lt;ref&gt;Josephson-Storm (2017), p. 55&lt;/ref&gt; The writers emphasized an individual’s right to religious sovereignty.&lt;ref name="Lough, p. 196"/&gt;

These challenges led to suppression from church and state authorities. The ''Encyclopédie'' and its contributors endured many attacks and attempts at censorship by the clergy or other censors, which threatened the publication of the project as well as the authors themselves. The [[Curia regis#France|King's Council]] suppressed the ''Encyclopédie'' in 1759.&lt;ref&gt;[http://historicaltextarchive.com/sections.php?action=read&amp;artid=780 "Diderot's Encyclopedia"]. Historical Text Archive.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Catholic Church]], under [[Pope Clement XIII]], placed it on its [[Index Librorum Prohibitorum|list of banned books]]. Prominent intellectuals criticized it, most famously [[Jean-Jacques Lefranc, Marquis de Pompignan|Lefranc de Pompignan]] at the [[Académie française|French Academy]]. A playwright, [[Charles Palissot de Montenoy]], wrote a play called ''Les Philosophes'' to criticize the ''Encyclopédie''. When Abbé [[André Morellet]], one of the contributors to the ''Encyclopédie'', wrote a mock preface for it, he was sent to the [[Bastille]] due to allegations of libel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Aldridge|first=Alfred Owen|title=Voltaire and the Century of Light|year=2015|publisher=Princeton Legacy Library|pages=266|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=bEl9BgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA266&amp;lpg=PA266}}&lt;/ref&gt;

To defend themselves from controversy, the encyclopedia’s articles wrote of theological topics in a mixed manner. Some articles supported orthodoxy, and some included overt criticisms of Christianity. To avoid direct retribution from censors, writers often hid criticism in obscure articles or expressed it in ironic terms.&lt;ref&gt;Lough, p. 236&lt;/ref&gt; Nonetheless, the contributors still openly attacked the Catholic Church in certain articles with examples including criticizing excess festivals, monasteries, and celibacy of the clergy.&lt;ref&gt;Lough, pp. 258–66&lt;/ref&gt;

===Politics and society===
The ''Encyclopédie'' is often seen as an influence for the [[French Revolution]] because of its emphasis on Enlightenment political theories. Diderot and other authors, in famous articles such as "Political Authority", emphasized the shift of the origin of political authority from divinity or heritage to the people. This Enlightenment ideal, espoused by Rousseau and others, advocated that people have the right to consent to their government in a form of social contract.&lt;ref&gt;Roche, p. 190&lt;/ref&gt;

Another major, contentious component of political issues in the ''Encyclopédie'' was personal or natural rights. Articles such as "Natural Rights" by Diderot explained the relationship between individuals and the general will. The natural state of humanity, according to the authors, is barbaric and unorganized. To balance the desires of individuals and the needs of the general will, humanity requires civil society and laws that benefit all persons. Writers, to varying degrees, criticized [[Thomas Hobbes]]' notions of a selfish humanity that requires a sovereign to rule over it.&lt;ref&gt;Roche, pp. 191–92&lt;/ref&gt;

In terms of economics, the ''Encyclopédie'' expressed favor for [[laissez-faire]] ideals or principles of economic liberalism. Articles concerning economics or markets, such as "Economic Politics", generally favored free competition and denounced monopolies. Articles often criticized guilds as creating monopolies and approved of state intervention to remove such monopolies. The writers advocated extending laissez-faire principles of liberalism from the market to the individual level, such as with privatization of education and opening of careers to all levels of wealth.&lt;ref&gt;Lough, pp. 331–35&lt;/ref&gt;

===Science and technology===
At the same time, the ''Encyclopédie'' was a vast compendium of knowledge, notably on the technologies of the period, describing the traditional craft tools and processes. Much information was taken from the ''[[Descriptions des Arts et Métiers]]''. These articles applied a scientific approach to understanding the mechanical and production processes, and offered new ways to improve machines to make them more efficient.&lt;ref&gt;Brewer 2011, p. 55&lt;/ref&gt; Diderot felt that people should have access to "useful knowledge" that they can apply to their everyday life.&lt;ref&gt;Burke, p. 17&lt;/ref&gt;

==Influence==
The ''Encyclopédie'' played an important role in the intellectual ferment leading to the French Revolution. "No encyclopaedia perhaps has been of such political importance, or has occupied so conspicuous a place in the civil and literary history of its century. It sought not only to give information, but to guide opinion," wrote the [[1911 Encyclopædia Britannica|1911 ''Encyclopædia Britannica'']]. In ''The Encyclopédie and the Age of Revolution'', a work published in conjunction with a 1989 exhibition of the ''Encyclopédie'' at the [[University of California, Los Angeles]], Clorinda Donato writes the following:
{{quote|The encyclopedians successfully argued and marketed their belief in the potential of reason and unified knowledge to empower human will and thus helped to shape the social issues that the French Revolution would address. Although it is doubtful whether the many artisans, technicians, or laborers whose work and presence and interspersed throughout the ''Encyclopédie'' actually read it, the recognition of their work as equal to that of intellectuals, clerics, and rulers prepared the terrain for demands for increased representation. Thus the ''Encyclopédie'' served to recognize and galvanize a new power base, ultimately contributing to the destruction of old values and the creation of new ones (12).}}

While many contributors to the ''Encyclopédie'' had no interest in radically reforming French society, the ''Encyclopédie'' as a whole pointed that way. The ''Encyclopédie'' denied that the teachings of the Catholic Church could be treated as authoritative in matters of science. The editors also refused to treat the decisions of political powers as definitive in intellectual or artistic questions. Some articles talked about changing social and political institutions that would improve their society for everyone.&lt;ref&gt;Spielvogel, pp. 480–81&lt;/ref&gt; Given that Paris was the intellectual capital of Europe at the time and that many European leaders used French as their administrative language, these ideas had the capacity to spread.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt;

The ''Encyclopédie''{{'}}s influence continues today. Historian Dan O'Sullivan compares it to [[Wikipedia]]:

{{quote|Like Wikipedia, the ''Encyclopédie'' was a collaborative effort involving numerous writers and technicians. As do [[Wikipedians]] today, Diderot and his colleagues needed to engage with the latest technology in dealing with the problems of designing an up-to-date encyclopedia. These included what kind of information to include, how to set up links between various articles, and how to achieve the maximum readership.&lt;ref&gt;O'Sullivan, p. 45&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==Quotations==
* The goal of an encyclopedia is to assemble all the knowledge scattered on the surface of the earth, to demonstrate the general system to the people with whom we live, &amp; to transmit it to the people who will come after us, so that the works of centuries past is not useless to the centuries which follow, that our descendants, by becoming more learned, may become more virtuous &amp; happier, &amp; that we do not die without having merited being part of the human race. (''Encyclopédie'', Diderot)&lt;ref&gt;Blom, p. 139&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"En effet, le but d'une Encyclopédie est de rassembler les connoissances éparses sur la surface de la terre; d'en exposer le système général aux hommes avec qui nous vivons, &amp; de le transmettre aux hommes qui viendront après nous; afin que les travaux des siecles passés n'aient pas été des travaux inutiles pour les siecles qui succéderont; que nos neveux, devenant plus instruits, deviennent en même tems plus vertueux &amp; plus heureux, &amp; que nous ne mourions pas sans avoir bien mérité du genre humain." From [http://artflsrv02.uchicago.edu/cgi-bin/philologic/getobject.pl?c.4:1252.encyclopedie0513 uchicago.edu].&lt;/ref&gt;
* "Reason is to the philosopher what [[Grace (Christianity)|grace]] is to the Christian...  Other men walk in darkness; the philosopher, who has the same passions, acts only after reflection;  he walks through the night, but it is preceded by a torch.  The philosopher forms his principles on an infinity of particular observations.  He does not confuse truth with plausibility; he takes for truth what is true, for forgery what is false, for doubtful what is doubtful, and probable what is probable.  The philosophical spirit is thus a spirit of observation and accuracy." (''Philosophers'', Dumarsais)
* "If exclusive privileges were not granted, and if the financial system would not tend to concentrate wealth, there would be few great fortunes and no quick wealth.  When the means of growing rich is divided between a greater number of citizens, wealth will also be more evenly distributed; extreme poverty and extreme wealth would be also rare." (''Wealth'', Diderot)
* "[[Urena lobata|Aguaxima]], a plant growing in Brazil and on the islands of South America. This is all that we are told about it; and I would like to know for whom such descriptions are made. It cannot be for the natives of the countries concerned, who are likely to know more about the aguaxima than is contained in this description, and who do not need to learn that the aguaxima grows in their country. It is as if you said to a Frenchman that the pear tree is a tree that grows in France, in Germany, etc. It is not meant for us either, for what do we care that there is a tree in Brazil named aguaxima, if all we know about it is its name? What is the point of giving the name? It leaves the ignorant just as they were and teaches the rest of us nothing. If all the same I mention this plant here, along with several others that are described just as poorly, then it is out of consideration for certain readers who prefer to find nothing in a dictionary article or even to find something stupid than to find no article at all." (''Aguaxima'', Diderot)

In the [[eurocode]] series of [[European Committee for Standardization|European standards]] (EN) related to [[construction]], '''''Eurocode 7: Geotechnical design''''' (abbreviated '''EN 1997''' or, informally, '''EC 7''') describes how to design [[geotechnical]] [[structure]]s, using the [[limit state design]] philosophy. It is published in two parts; "General rules" and "Ground investigation and testing". It was approved by the [[European Committee for Standardization]] (CEN) on 12 June 2006. Like other [[Eurocode]]s, it became mandatory in member states in March 2010.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.eurocodes.co.uk/Content.aspx?ContentId=46 eurocodes.co.uk]&lt;/ref&gt;

Eurocode 7 is intended to:
*be used in conjunction with [[EN 1990]], which establishes the principles and requirements for safety and serviceability, describes the basis of design and verification and gives guidelines for related aspects of structural reliability,
*be applied to the geotechnical aspects of the design of buildings and civil engineering works and it is concerned with the requirements for strength, stability, serviceability and durability of structures.

Eurocode 7 is composed of the following parts

==Part 1: General rules==
EN 1997-1 is intended to be used as a general basis for the geotechnical aspects of the design of buildings and civil engineering works.

===Contents===
* General
* Basis of design
* Geotechnical data
* Supervision of construction, monitoring and maintenance
* Fill, [[dewatering]], ground improvement and reinforcement
* Spread foundations
* [[Deep foundation]] (pile foundations)
* Anchorages
* Retaining structures
* [[Hydraulic failure]]
* Overall stability
* [[wikt:embankment|Embankment]]s

EN 1997-1 is accompanied by Annexes A to J, which provide:
*'''Annex A''' Recommended partial safety factor values; different values of the partial factors may be set by the National annex.
*'''Annexes B to J''' Supplementary informative guidance such as internationally applied calculation methods.

==Part 2: Ground investigation and testing==
EN 1997-2 is intended to be used in conjunction with EN 1997-1 and provides rules supplementary to EN 1997-1 related to, planning and reporting of ground investigations, general requirements for a number of commonly used laboratory and field tests, interpretation and evaluation of test results and derivation of values of  geotechnical parameters and coefficients.

==Part 3: Design assisted by field testing==
There is no longer a Part 3. It was amalgamated into EN 1997-2

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11964">[[File:Percival David Collection DSCF3075.jpg|thumb|Small [[Guan ware]] bowl on legs, with pronounced, and in this case deliberate crackle in the glaze]] 
'''Glaze defects''' are any flaws in the surface quality of a [[ceramic glaze]], its physical structure or its interaction with the body.

==Body/glaze interaction problems==
Glaze defects can be as a result of the incompatibility of the body and the selected glaze, examples including ''Crazing'' and ''Peeling''.

===Crazing===
Crazing is a [[spider web]] pattern of cracks penetrating the glaze. It is caused by [[tensile stress]]es greater than the glaze is able to withstand.&lt;ref name=Taylor-Bull&gt;"Ceramics Glaze Technology". J. R. Taylor, A. C. Bull. ''Institute Of Ceramics / Pergamon Press.'' 1986.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ceramic Glazes. 3rd edition. Parmelee C. W. ''The Maple Press Company.'' 1973&lt;/ref&gt; Common reasons for such stresses are: a mismatch between the [[thermal expansion]]s of glaze and body; from moisture expansion of the body; and in the case of glazed [[tile]]s fixed to a wall, movement of the wall or of the bonding material used to fix the tile to the wall.&lt;ref name=Dictionary&gt;Dictionary Of Ceramics. Arthur Dodd &amp; David Murfin. 3rd edition. ''The Institute Of Minerals.'' 1994.&lt;/ref&gt;
The cracks can allow the ingress of [[water]] into the cracks. Once fired ware tends to be more resistant to crazing due to better development of the glaze/body interfacial layer, which reduces stress gradients between the glaze and body.&lt;ref name=Dictionary/&gt;

In pottery a distinction is often made between crazing, as an  accidental defect, and "crackle", which is when the same phenomenon, often strongly accentuated, is produced deliberately. The Chinese in particular enjoyed the random effects of crackle, though it spans a spectrum: in [[Ru ware]] it is a tolerated feature of most pieces, but not sought, vs in [[Guan ware]] a strong crackle is a desired effect.

The causes of crazing include:&lt;ref name=Taylor-Bull/&gt;&lt;ref name=Dictionary/&gt;

*'''Thermal expansion mis-match.''' Poor fit between the glaze and the body's thermal expansion is the main cause of crazing and can be due to:

:*Under-firing resulting in failure to develop sufficient body thermal expansion.
:*Firing too quickly, resulting in failure to achieve sufficient [[heatwork]].
:*Low thermal expansion body.
:*High thermal expansion glaze.
:*Over-firing of vitreous ware.

*'''Moisture expansion of the body.''' Porous bodies swell slightly due to absorption of moisture. Where glazes are in only slight [[compression (physical)|compression]] this can be sufficient to bring them into tension. The problem results in delayed or secondary crazing, which occurs over a period of time after the ware has been produced.
*'''Glazing too thickly.''' This is a common cause of crazing. Glazes, which should be craze resistant, can craze if applied too thickly. This is because the further the glaze surface is away from the body the lower the compression acting on it.
*'''Thermal shock.''' Opening the kiln too soon above 100&amp;nbsp;°C can cause crazing and dunting. Above 200&amp;nbsp;°C catastrophic failure can occur due to the volume changes at the cristobalite inversion (around 225&amp;nbsp;°C)
*'''Glaze Fit.''' The matching of the thermal expansion of a glaze to that of the body on which it is held. To prevent crazing the glaze must be in compression when the ware has been cooled from the kiln to room temperature; to achieve this, the thermal expansion of the glaze must be less than that of the body.

''Steger's Crazing Test'' is a method for the assessment of the glaze fit. It is undertaken by measuring any deformation on cooling of a thin bar that was glazed only on one side.&lt;ref&gt;W. Steger. ''Ber. Deut. Keram.'' 9 (4). 1928.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Evaluation Of The Steger Method In The Determination Of Ceramic-Glaze Joining". M. Peterson, A. M. Bernardin, N. C. Kuhnen, H. G. Riella. ''Materials Science and Engineering A'' 466 (2007). pp. 183–186&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Temperature Gradient Method for Determining Firing Range of Ceramic Bodies". R. Stone. ''Journal of the American Ceramic Society.'' Volume 36 Issue 4, pp. 140–142. 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; A common method of testing glazed ceramic ware for crazing resistance is to expose pieces of ware to the steam in an autoclave at a minimum of 50 psi.&lt;ref&gt;British Standard 3402 and British Standard 4034&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Autoclave Test Results On Crazing Of Sanitary Ware And Wall Tiles". ''[[Journal of the American Ceramic Society]].'' Volume 29 Issue 7, pp. 203–204. 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

''Seger's Rules'' are a series of empirical rules put forward by the H. A. Seger for the prevention of crazing and peeling. To prevent crazing, the body should be adjusted as follows: decrease the clay, increase the free [[silica]]; replace some of the [[ball clay]] by [[kaolin]]; decrease the [[feldspar]]; grind the silica more finely; [[Bisque (pottery)|biscuit]] fire at higher temperature. Alternatively, the glaze can be adjusted: increase silica and/or decrease fluxes; replace some SiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; by B&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;; replace fluxes of high equivalent weight by fluxes of lower equivalent weight. To prevent peeling, the body or glaze should be adjusted in the reverse direction.&lt;ref&gt;''The Collected Writings Of Hermann August Seger''. H. A. Seger, E. Cramer. [[Nabu Press]]. 2010 [[Print on demand|POD]] edition.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Peeling===
The breaking away of glaze from ceramic ware in consequence of too high a compression in the glaze layer; this is caused by the glaze being of such a composition that its expansion coefficient is too low to match that of the body. It is the opposite of crazing, as are the preventative steps: see ''Seger's Rule'' above. Peeling is also known as ''shivering''.&lt;ref name=Dictionary/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Glazing Faults In Raw Glazes". ''Ceram. Inf.'' 18, (207), 348, 1983.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Ways Of Eliminating Glaze Defects In Practice. Pt. 1. Crazing And Peeling". H. Simonis. ''Keram. Z.'' 31, (12), 717, 1979.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Metal release==
Regulations have existed since the late 1960s to protect consumers from the potential risk of toxic materials, mainly metals, being released from glazes into drink and foodstuffs. [[Lead]] and [[cadmium]] are the metals of greatest concern, although testing can be extended to include others. The propensity for any glaze to release metal may depend on complex interactions between the formulation used, any applied decoration and the kiln atmosphere.&lt;ref name=Taylor-Bull/&gt;

Monitoring the level of metal release from glazed ware forms part of the [[Quality control]] procedures of all reputable producers.&lt;ref name=Taylor-Bull/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Countermeasures For Lead Release From On-Glaze Decorating Of Porcelain Products". A. Fukunaga. ''Ceram. Jap.'' 37, no. 8. pp. 628. 2002.&lt;/ref&gt; Test methods are specified according to national and international standards, although testing usually involves: the ware being immersed or filled with a 4% [[acetic acid]] solution; covered and left for 24 hours at room temperature, although if cooking ware is being tested higher temperatures are needed; the acetic acid solution decanted from the ware and the concentration of leached metal measured by [[Atomic absorption spectroscopy]].&lt;ref&gt;"Whitewares: Production, Testing And Quality Control". W. Ryan, C. Radford. ''Pergamon Press / Institute Of Ceramics.'' 1987.&lt;/ref&gt; Acceptance limits are enforced by legislation, and whilst varying between countries all are within the [[Parts per million|ppm]] range. Some of the most well recognised legislation are: across Europe 'EC Directive 84/500/EEC 1984'; for the UK 'GB Ceramic Ware (Safety) Regulations SI 1647, 1988'; and for the USA 'FDA Compliance Policy Guide 7117.06 and 7117.07 for cadmium and lead.'&lt;ref&gt;"Decoration Trends In The Chinese Tableware Market". H.Zhou. ''Ceramic Forum International.'' DKG 85, no.5, 2008, pp. E30–E31.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Understanding Heavy Metal Limits". ''Ceramic Industry.'' 158, no. 4, 2008, pp. 36–38.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Toxic Metal Release From Ceramic Tableware: A Guide To Worldwide Regulations". J. Dawson. ''Ceram Research.'' Special Publication no. 145, p. 18. 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Glaze Surface Defects==

===Blisters===
A large bubble sometimes present as a fault in ceramic ware. Blisters appear as large bubbles either just below or penetrating the surface, leaving sharp, rough edges that collect dirt. The surface of the glaze is very unpleasant and looks like a boiled mass of bubbles, craters and pinholes.&lt;ref name=Dictionary/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Formation Of Blisters And Pinholes In Raw Glazes Of Ceramic Sanitaryware. Pt. 1. Literature Review On Their Formation And Determination". G. Schopwinkel, H. W. Hennicke. ''Keram. Z.'' 41, no. 11, pp. 830–834. 1989.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Crawling===
A defect that appears as irregular, bare patches of fired body showing through the glaze where it has failed to adhere to or wet the body on firing. The cause is a weak bond between glaze and body; this may result from greasy patches or dust on the surface of the biscuit ware or from shrinkage of the applied glaze slip during drying. The fault is more likely to occur with once-fired ware such as sanitaryware.&lt;ref name=Taylor-Bull/&gt;&lt;ref name=Dictionary/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Crawling—A Serious Defect In Glazes After Firing". S. K. Mukherji, B. B. Machhoya, R. M. Savsani, T. K. Dan. ''Ceramurgia'' 23, no. 6, pp. 269–275. 1993&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Problem Of The Glazing Defect Crawling". H. Mortel, I. Berger. ''Keram. Z.'' 45, no. 5, pp. 259–262. 1993.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Metal Marking===
Metal marks are dark lines, often accompanied by damage in the glaze, caused by the deposition of metal during the use of metal utensils. The cutlery, or other relatively soft metal, will leave a very thin smear of metal on pottery ware if the glaze is minutely pitted. A glaze may have this defective surface as it leaves the [[Ceramic_glaze#Process|glost kiln]], or it may subsequently develop such a surface as a result of inadequate chemical durability. The fault is also known as cutlery marking.&lt;ref name=Dictionary/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"The Marking of Glazes by Cutlery". W. P. Howells, W. Roberts. ''British Ceramic Research Association.'' Technical Note 98. 1966.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Metal Marking Of Dinnerware". C. Prieur, G. Bisson, C. Casset. "Industrial Ceramics" no. 927, pp. 458–461. 1997.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Testing For Metal Marking Resistance". Z. C. Seedorff, R. C. Patterson, H. J. Pangels, R. A. Eppler. ''Ceram. Eng. Sci. Proc.'' 13, no. 1/2, pp. 196–209. 1992.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Pin-hole===
A fault that is commonly the result of a bubble in the glaze when it was [[molten]] that burst but was only partially healed. The bubbles are most often from [[gas]] that originates from air trapped between the particles of powdered glaze as the glaze begins to mature, or from gases evolved from [[carbonate]] compounds.&lt;ref&gt;"Practical Suggestions For Control Of Glaze Defects. Pt. 2". H. Simonis. ''Keram. Z.'' 32, (10), 593, 1980.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Pinholing in Sanitary Whiteware. E. G. Walker. ''The British Ceramic Research Association.'' TN20. 1962.&lt;/ref&gt;

A specific example of pin-holes is ''Spit-out''. These are pin-holes or craters sometimes occurring in glazed non-vitreous ceramics while they are in the decorating [[kiln]]. The cause of this defect is the evolution of [[water vapour]], adsorbed by the porous body, during the period between the glost firing and the decorating firing, via minute cracks in the glaze.&lt;ref&gt;The Causes of Pinholes in Vitreous China Sanitaryware. M. E. Twentyman, P. Hancock. ''The British Ceramic Research Association.'' RP. 706. 1979.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"The A. T. Green Book". pp. 255–268 "Spit-out". W. T. Wilkinson, A. Dinsdale. ''The British Ceramic Research Association.'' 1959.&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Habitats Directive''' (more formally known as '''Council Directive 92/43/EEC on the Conservation of natural habitats and of wild fauna and flora''') is a [[European Union directive]] adopted in 1992 as an EU response to the [[Convention on the Conservation of European Wildlife and Natural Habitats|Berne Convention]]. It is one of the EU's two directives in relation to wildlife and nature conservation, the other being the [[Birds Directive]].&lt;ref name="EUwebsite"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ec.europa.eu/environment/nature |title=EUROPA – Environnement – Nature and Biodiversity – Homepage |publisher=European Commission |accessdate=26 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=JNCC-EUlaw&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jncc.gov.uk/page-1372 |title=Joint Nature Conservation Committee – European Legislation |publisher=Government of the United Kingdom |accessdate=26 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is one of European nature's policies that establishes one organised network—[[Natura 2000]],&lt;ref&gt;[[Natura 2000]]&lt;/ref&gt;{{Better source|reason=per WP:CIRCULAR|date=January 2018}} which intends to protect nature and wildlife. The Habitats Directive requires national governments to specify areas that are expected to be ensuring the conservation of flora and fauna species.

The '''Habitats Directive''' assures the conservation of endangered native animal and plant divisions. It aims to protect 220 habitats and approximately 1,000 species listed in the directive's Annexes. These are species and habitats which are considered to be of European interest, following criteria given in the directive.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ec.europa.eu/environment/nature/mission_statement/index_en.htm EUROPA – Environnement – Nature and Biodiversity – Mission Statement] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061019093120/http://ec.europa.eu/environment/nature/mission_statement/index_en.htm |date=19 October 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="JNCC-Habitat"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jncc.gov.uk/page-1374 |title=Joint Nature Conservation Committee – EC Habitats Directive |publisher=Government of the United Kingdom |date=30 October 1994 |accessdate=26 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; It directs Member States of the EU to take measures to maintain the "favourable conservation status" of protected habitats and species.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Epstein|first=Yaffa|date=7 May 2016|title=Favourable Conservation Status for Species: Examining the Habitats Directive’s Key Concept through a Case Study of the Swedish Wolf|url=http://jel.oxfordjournals.org/content/early/2016/05/06/jel.eqw006|journal=Journal of Environmental Law|pages=eqw006|doi=10.1093/jel/eqw006|issn=0952-8873}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Annex I covers habitats, 
* Annex II species requiring designation of [[Special Areas of Conservation]], 
* Annex IV species in need of strict protection, and 
* Annex V species whose taking from the wild can be restricted by European law.
The directive led to the setting up of a network of Special Areas of Conservation, which together with the existing [[Special Protection Area]]s form a network of protected sites across the [[European Union]] called [[Natura 2000]].&lt;ref name="EUwebsite"/&gt;&lt;ref name="JNCC-EUlaw"/&gt; Article 17 of the directive requires EU Member States to report on the state of their protected areas every six years. The first complete set of country data was reported in 2007.

==History==

From 1988 to 1992, the policy was given importance at the national level by policy experts, scientists and ecologists and later on spawned political, social and administrative discussions within the states that are engaged in the policy in the 1990s.

In 1998, the protection of the habitat of the [[European hamster]]&lt;ref&gt;[[European hamster]]&lt;/ref&gt;{{Better source|reason=per WP:CIRCULAR|date=January 2018}} —''Korenwolf'', received a lot of attention from the public and the media during discussions projected by the ''Non-governmental Organization'' responsible for the matter. The extinction of the species symbolised the failed conservation of wild flora and fauna and other species of plants and animals and the deficiency of the pursuit for nature policies in the Netherlands.

==Implications==
Due to differences in nature conservation traditions, national problems have arisen in the implementation of the directive. Since member states in the South and East of Europe participated less in nature policies, these states experienced misfits in promoting the new EU-originating provisions. In Germany, Austria, Italy and Belgium, the observation of conflicts between various government layers have caused prolonged delays in the management of nature policies. On the other hand, in member states such as United Kingdom and Sweden, positive outcomes have developed due to stakeholder involvement, pro-active authorities, agencies responsible for implementation and public participation.

Not only does the '''Habitats Directive''' promote nature and wildlife conservation but it also develops a disquisition between ''"economy" and "ecology"'' (Van der Zouwen and Van den Top 2002). Several discussions have been made regarding the directive and its flaws by the Dutch politics and administration— these discussions are still going on until today. The disadvantages of the policy have been believed to raise awareness on Europe's implementation of policies. Representatives of provinces and municipalities have been putting efforts in implementing nature policies within their area and scope. The '''Habitats Directive''' and [[Birds Directive]]&lt;ref&gt;[[Birds Directive]]&lt;/ref&gt;{{Better source|reason=per WP:CIRCULAR|date=January 2018}}were considered as the first legitimate effort in pursuing [[Europeanization]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Europeanisation]]&lt;/ref&gt;{{Better source|reason=per WP:CIRCULAR|date=January 2018}}

'''Hormonal contraception''' refers to [[birth control]] methods that act on the [[endocrine system]]. Almost all methods are composed of [[steroid hormones]], although in [[India]] one [[selective estrogen receptor modulator]] is marketed as a contraceptive. The original hormonal method—the [[combined oral contraceptive pill]]—was first marketed as a contraceptive in 1960.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author1=Susan Scott Ricci |author2=Terri Kyle |year=2009 |chapter=Common Reproductive Issues|title=Contraception |publisher=Lippincott Williams &amp; Wilkins| page=119}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the ensuing decades many other delivery methods have been developed, although the oral and injectable methods are by far the most popular. Altogether, 18% of the world's contraceptive users rely on hormonal methods.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Jones, Rachel K. |year=2011 |title= Beyond Birth Control: The Overlooked Benefits Of Oral Contraceptive Pills|journal=Guttmacher Institute |volume=November|url=http://www.guttmacher.org/pubs/Beyond-Birth-Control.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hormonal contraception is highly effective: when taken on the prescribed schedule, users of steroid hormone methods experience pregnancy rates of less than 1% per year. Perfect-use pregnancy rates for most hormonal contraceptives are usually around the 0.3% rate or less.&lt;ref name="npsnews"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nps.org.au/health_professionals/publications/nps_news/current/hormonal_contraception_tailoring_for_the_individual |title=NPS News 54: Hormonal contraceptives - tailoring for the individual |author=National Prescribing Service |date=11 December 2009 |accessdate=19 March 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Currently available methods can only be used by women; the development of a [[male hormonal contraceptive]] is an active research area.

There are two main types of hormonal contraceptive formulations: ''combined methods'' which contain both an [[estrogen (medication)|estrogen]] and a [[progestin]], and ''progestogen-only methods'' which contain only [[progesterone]] or one of its synthetic analogues (progestins). Combined methods work by suppressing [[ovulation]] and thickening [[cervical mucus]]; while progestogen-only methods reduce the frequency of ovulation, most of them rely more heavily on changes in cervical mucus. The incidence of certain side effects is different for the different formulations: for example, [[breakthrough bleeding]] is much more common with progestogen-only methods. Certain serious complications occasionally caused by estrogen-containing contraceptives are not believed to be caused by progestogen-only formulations: [[deep vein thrombosis]] is one example of this.

==Medical uses==
Hormonal contraception is primarily used for the prevention of [[pregnancy]], but is also prescribed for the treatment of [[polycystic ovary syndrome]], menstrual disorders such as [[dysmenorrhea]] and [[menorrhagia]], and [[hirsutism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Hormonal Contraceptives Offer Benefits Beyond Pregnancy Prevention|url=http://www.acog.org/About_ACOG/News_Room/News_Releases/2009/Hormonal_Contraceptives_Offer_Benefits_Beyond_Pregnancy_Prevention|work=The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists|accessdate=5 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Polycystic ovary syndrome===
Hormonal treatments, such as hormonal contraceptives, are frequently successful at alleviating symptoms associated with [[polycystic ovary syndrome]]. [[Birth control pills]] are often prescribed to reverse the effects of excessive [[androgen]] levels, and decrease ovarian hormone production.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Hirsutism and Polycystic Ovary Syndrome|url=http://www.asrm.org/uploadedFiles/ASRM_Content/Resources/Patient_Resources/Fact_Sheets_and_Info_Booklets/hirsutismPCOS.pdf|work=American Society for Reproductive Medicine|accessdate=5 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Dysmenorrhea===
Hormonal birth control methods such as [[birth control pills]], the [[contraceptive patch]], [[vaginal ring]], [[contraceptive implant]], and [[hormonal IUD]] are used to treat cramping and pain associated with primary [[dysmenorrhea]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Noncontraceptive Benefits of Birth Control Pills|url=http://www.reproductivefacts.org/Noncontraceptive_Benefits_of_Birth_Control_Pills_factsheet/|work=Reproductivefacts.org|publisher=The American Society for Reproductive Medicine|accessdate=5 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Dysmenorrhea|url=http://www.acog.org/~/media/For%20Patients/faq046.pdf?dmc=1&amp;ts=20130509T0012463128|work=The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists|accessdate=5 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Menorrhagia===
[[Oral contraceptives]] are prescribed in the treatment of [[menorrhagia]] to help regulate menstrual cycles and prevent prolonged menstrual bleeding. The [[hormonal IUD]] ([[Mirena]]) releases [[levonorgestrel]] which thins the uterine lining, preventing excessive bleeding and loss of iron.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Menorrhagia (Heavy Menstrual Bleeding)|url=http://www.mayoclinic.com/health/menorrhagia/DS00394/DSECTION=treatments-and-drugs|work=The Mayo Clinic|accessdate=5 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Hirsutism===
Birth control pills are the most commonly prescribed hormonal treatment for [[hirsutism]], as they prevent [[ovulation]] and decrease [[androgen]] production by the [[ovaries]]. Additionally, [[estrogen (medication)|estrogen]] in the pills stimulates the liver to produce more of a protein that binds to androgens and reduces their activity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Hirsutism and Polycystic Ovary Syndrome (PCOS)|url=http://www.asrm.org/uploadedFiles/ASRM_Content/Resources/Patient_Resources/Fact_Sheets_and_Info_Booklets/hirsutismPCOS.pdf|work=American Society for Reproductive Medicine|accessdate=5 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Effectiveness===
Modern contraceptives using steroid hormones have ''perfect-use'' or ''method'' failure rates of less than 1% per year. The lowest failure rates are seen with the implants Jadelle and Implanon, at 0.05% per year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Sivin I, Campodonico I, Kiriwat O, Holma P, Diaz S, Wan L, Biswas A, Viegas O, el din Abdalla K, Anant MP, Pavez M, Stern J | title = The performance of levonorgestrel rod and Norplant contraceptive implants: a 5 year randomized study | journal = Hum.

[[Long acting reversible contraceptive|Long-acting methods]] such as the implant and the IUS are user-independent methods.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=O'Connor |first=M.L. |title=Contraceptive Use Elevates The Odds of Barrier Method Use for Disease Prevention |journal=Family Planning Perspectives |volume=33 |issue=2 |publisher=Guttmacher Institute |date=March–April 2001 |url=http://www.guttmacher.org/pubs/journals/3309301b.html |accessdate=2009-08-30 |doi=10.2307/2673760 |pages=93}}&lt;/ref&gt; For user-independent methods, the ''typical'' or ''actual-use'' failure rates are the same as the method failure rates.&lt;ref name="trussell"/&gt; Methods that require regular action by the user—such as taking a pill every day—have typical failure rates higher than perfect-use failure rates. ''Contraceptive Technology'' reports a typical failure rate of 3% per year for the injection Depo-Provera, and 8% per year for most other user-dependent hormonal methods.&lt;ref name="trussell"/&gt; While no large studies have been done, it is hoped that newer methods which require less frequent action (such as the patch) will result in higher user compliance and therefore lower typical failure rates.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Paladine |first=Heather |title=What’s New In Contraception |work=The Female Patient |year=2003 |url=http://www.femalepatient.com/html/arc/sel/feb03/028_02_013.asp |accessdate=2009-08-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Combined vs. progestogen-only===
While unpredictable [[breakthrough bleeding]] is a possible side effect for all hormonal contraceptives, it is more common with progestogen-only formulations.&lt;ref&gt;'''POP''':{{cite journal | author = Kovacs G | title = Progestogen-only pills and bleeding disturbances | journal = Human Reproduction | volume = 11 | issue = Supplement 2 | pages = 20–3 | date = October 1996 | pmid = 8982741 | doi = 10.1093/humrep/11.suppl_2.20 }}&lt;br/&gt;

 --&gt;Most regimens of COCPs, NuvaRing, and the contraceptive patch incorporate a placebo or break week that causes regular withdrawal bleeding. While women using combined injectable contraceptives may experience [[amenorrhea]] (lack of periods), they typically have predictable bleeding comparable to that of women using COCPs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Garceau RJ, Wajszczuk CJ, Kaunitz AM | title = Bleeding patterns of women using Lunelle monthly contraceptive injections (medroxyprogesterone acetate and estradiol cypionate injectable suspension) compared with those of women using Ortho-Novum 7/7/7 (norethindrone/ethinyl estradiol triphasic) or other oral contraceptives | journal = Contraception | volume = 62 | issue = 6 | pages = 289–95 | date = December 2000 | pmid = 11239615 | doi = 10.1016/S0010-7824(00)00183-9 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although high-quality studies are lacking,&lt;ref name="truitt"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Truitt ST, Fraser AB, Grimes DA, Gallo MF, Schulz KF | title = Hormonal contraception during lactation: systematic review of randomized controlled trials | journal = Contraception | volume = 68 | issue = 4 | pages = 233–8 | date = October 2003 | pmid = 14572885 | doi = 10.1016/S0010-7824(03)00133-1 }}&lt;/ref&gt; it is believed that estrogen-containing contraceptives significantly decrease the quantity of milk in breastfeeding women.&lt;!--

While combined contraceptives increase the risk for [[deep vein thrombosis]] (DVT - blood clots), progestogen-only contraceptives are not believed to affect DVT formation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Progestin-only Contraceptives |work=Hall Health Primary Care Center |publisher=University of Wisconsin-Seattle |date=2007-02-11 |url=http://depts.washington.edu/hhpccweb/article-detail.php?ArticleID=105&amp;ClinicID=1 |accessdate=2009-09-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Side effects==

===Cancers===
*There is a mixed effect of combined hormonal contraceptives on the rates of various cancers, with the [[International Agency for Research on Cancer]] (IARC) stating: "It was concluded that, if the reported association was causal, the excess risk for breast cancer associated with typical patterns of current use of combined oral contraceptives was very small."&lt;ref name=IARC99 /&gt;&lt;ref name=IARC2007&gt;{{Cite journal | publisher = [[International Agency for Research on Cancer]] | work = IARC Monographs on the Evaluation of Carcinogenic Risks to Humans | volume = 91 | year = 2007 | title = Combined Estrogen-Progestogen Contraceptives | format = [[Portable Document Format|PDF]] | url = http://monographs.iarc.fr/ENG/Monographs/vol91/mono91-6.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt; and also saying that "there is also conclusive evidence that these agents have a protective effect against cancers of the ovary and endometrium":&lt;ref name=IARC99&gt;{{cite book | author=International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) | title=Oral Contraceptives, Combined | edition=Vol. 72 | year=1999 | chapter=5. Summary of Data Reported and Evaluation | chapterurl=http://www.inchem.org/documents/iarc/vol72/vol72-1.html | page=49}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The (IARC) notes that "the weight of the evidence suggests a small increase in the relative risk for breast cancer among current and recent users" which following discontinuation then lessens over a period of 10 years to similar rates as women who never used them, as well as "The increase in risk for breast cancer associated with the use of combined oral contraceptives in younger women could be due to more frequent contacts with doctors" &lt;ref name=IARC2007/&gt;
* Small increases are also seen in the rates of [[cervical cancer]] and [[Hepatocellular carcinoma|hepatocellular (liver) tumours]].
* [[Endometrial cancer|Endometrial]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Endometrial cancer and oral contraceptives: an individual participant meta-analysis of 27 276 women with endometrial cancer from 36 epidemiological studies|journal=Lancet|date=Aug 4, 2015|doi=10.1016/S1470-2045(15)00212-0|volume=16|pages=1061–1070|pmid=26254030}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[ovarian cancer]] risks are approximately halved and persists for at least 10 years after cessation of use; although "sequential oral contraceptives which were removed from the consumer market in the 1970s was associated with an increased risk for endometrial cancer".
* Studies have overall not shown effects on the relative risks for colorectal, malignant melanoma or thyroid cancers.
* Information on progesterone-only pills is less extensive, due to smaller sampling sizes, but they do not appear to significantly increase the risk of breast cancer.&lt;ref name=iarc72&gt;{{cite book |author=IARC Working Group on the Evaluation of Carcinogenic Risks to Humans |title=Hormonal contraception and post-menopausal hormonal therapy; IARC monographs on the evaluation of carcinogenic risks to humans, Volume 72 |year=1999 |publisher=IARC Press |location=Lyon |isbn=92-832-1272-X |pages=339&amp;ndash;397 |chapter=Hormonal contraceptives, progestogens only |chapterurl=http://www.inchem.org/documents/iarc/vol72/vol72-2.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Most other forms of hormonal contraception are too new for meaningful data to be available, although risks and benefits are believed to be similar for methods which use the same hormones; e.g., risks for combined-hormone patches are thought to be roughly equivalent to those for combined-hormone pills.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| accessdate=2007-07-13| url=http://www.mckinley.uiuc.edu/Handouts/orthoevra_patch.html| title=McKinley Health Center, University of Illinois: OrthoEvra Contraceptive Patch}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cardiovascular disease===
Combined oral contraceptives can increase the risk of certain types of cardiovascular disease in women with a pre-existing condition or already-heightened risk of cardiovascular disease. Smoking (for women over 35), metabolic conditions like diabetes, obesity and family history of heart disease are all risk factors which may be exacerbated by the use of certain hormonal contraceptives.&lt;ref name="npsnews" /&gt;

===Blood Clots===
Hormonal contraception methods are consistently linked with the risk of developing blood clots. However, the risk does vary depending on the hormone type or birth control method being used.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Blood Clots with Hormonal Contraception|url=http://www.hormonesmatter.com/blood-clots-hormonal-contraception/|website=Hormones Matter|date=27 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Depression ===
There is a growing body of research evidence investigating the links between hormonal contraception, and potential adverse effects on women’s psychological health.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Zettermark|first=Sofia|last2=Vicente|first2=Raquel Perez|last3=Merlo|first3=Juan|date=2018-03-22|title=Hormonal contraception increases the risk of psychotropic drug use in adolescent girls but not in adults: A pharmacoepidemiological study on 800 000 Swedish women|url=http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0194773|journal=PLOS ONE|language=en|volume=13|issue=3|pages=e0194773|doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0194773|issn=1932-6203}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Skovlund|first=Charlotte Wessel|last2=Mørch|first2=Lina Steinrud|last3=Kessing|first3=Lars Vedel|last4=Lidegaard|first4=Øjvind|date=2016-11-01|title=Association of Hormonal Contraception With Depression|journal=JAMA Psychiatry|volume=73|issue=11|pages=1154–1162|doi=10.1001/jamapsychiatry.2016.2387|issn=2168-6238|pmid=27680324}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kulkarni|first=Jayashri|date=July 2007|title=Depression as a side effect of the contraceptive pill|journal=Expert Opinion on Drug Safety|volume=6|issue=4|pages=371–374|doi=10.1517/14740338.6.4.371|issn=1744-764X|pmid=17688380}}&lt;/ref&gt; Findings from a large Danish study of one million women (followed up from 2000-2013) were published in 2016, and reported that the use of hormonal contraception was associated with a statistically significant increased risk of subsequent depression, particularly amongst adolescents.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Within this study, women on the progestogen-only pill in particular, were 34% more likely to be subsequently be given a first diagnosis of depression or to take anti-depressants, in comparison to those not on hormonal contraception.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Similarly, in 2018, another large cohort study in Sweden with women aged 12–30 (n=815,662) found an association between hormonal contraception and subsequent use of psychotropic drugs, particularly amongst adolescents (aged 12–19).&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; These studies highlight the need for further research into the links between hormonal contraception, and adverse effects on women’s psychological health.

==Types==
There are two main classes of hormonal contraceptives: ''combined contraceptives'' contain both an estrogen (usually [[ethinylestradiol]]) and a [[progestin]]. ''Progestogen-only contraceptives'' contain only [[progesterone]] or a synthetic analogue (progestin). Also marketed is [[ormeloxifene]]; while not a hormone, ormeloxifene acts on the hormonal system to prevent pregnancy.

===Combined===
The most popular form of hormonal contraception, the [[combined oral contraceptive pill]] is known colloquially as ''the pill''. It is taken once a day, most commonly for 21 days followed by a seven-day break, although other regimens are also used. For women not using ongoing hormonal contraception, COCPs may be taken after intercourse as [[emergency contraception]]: this is known as the [[Yuzpe regimen]]. COCPs are available in [[oral contraceptive formulations|a variety of formulations]].

The [[contraceptive patch]] is applied to the skin and worn continuously. A series of three patches are worn for one week each, and then the user takes a one-week break. [[NuvaRing]] is worn inside the vagina. A ring is worn for three weeks. After removal, the user takes a one-week break before inserting a new ring. As with COCPs, other regimens may be used with the contraceptive patch or NuvaRing to provide [[extended cycle combined hormonal contraception]].

Some [[combined injectable contraceptive]]s can be administered as one injection per month.

===Progestogen-only===
The [[progestogen only pill]] (POP) is taken once per day within the same three-hour window. [[Oral contraceptive formulations#Progestogen only pills|Several different formulations]] of POP are marketed. A low-dose formulation is known as ''the minipill''. Unlike COCPs, progestogen-only pills are taken every day with no breaks or placebos. For women not using ongoing hormonal contraception, progestogen-only pills may be taken after intercourse as [[emergency contraception]]. There are a number of [[Emergency contraceptive availability by country|dedicated products]] sold for this purpose.

Hormonal intrauterine contraceptives are known as [[intrauterine system]]s (IUS) or Intrauterine Devices (IUD). An IUS/IUD must be inserted by a health professional. The copper IUD does not contain hormones. While a copper-containing IUD may be used as emergency contraception, the IUS has not been studied for this purpose.

[[Depo Provera]] is an injection that provides three months of contraceptive protection. Noristerat is another injection; it is given every two months.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Stacey |first=Dawn |title=Noristerat Injection |work=About.com |date=2009-07-28 |url=http://contraception.about.com/od/prescriptionoptions/g/Noristerat.htm |accessdate=2009-08-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Contraceptive implants]] are inserted under the skin of the upper arm, and contain progesterone only. [[Jadelle]] (Norplant 2) consists of two rods that release a low dose of hormones. It is effective for five years. Nexplanon has replaced the former [[Implanon]] and is also a single rod that releases etonogestrel (similar to the body's natural progesterone). The only difference between Implanon and Nexplanon is Nexplanon is radio opaque and can be detected by x-ray. This is needed for cases of implant migration. It is effective for three years and is usually done in office. It is over 99% effective. It works in 3 ways: 
1. Prevents ovulation- usually an egg does not mature
2. thickens cervical mucus so to prevent sperm from reaching the egg
3. If those 2 fail, the last is the progesterone causes the lining of the uterus to be too thin for implantation.

===Ormeloxifene===
[[Ormeloxifene]] is a [[selective estrogen receptor modulator]] (SERM). Marketed as Centchroman, Centron, or Saheli, it is pill that is taken once per week. Ormeloxifene is legally available only in [[India]].&lt;ref name="centron"/&gt;

==Mechanism of action==
The effect of hormonal agents on the reproductive system is complex. It is believed that combined hormonal contraceptives work primarily by preventing ovulation and thickening cervical mucus. Progestogen-only contraceptives can also prevent ovulation, but rely more significantly on the thickening of cervical mucus. Ormeloxifene does not affect ovulation, and its mechanism of action is not well understood.

===Combined===
Combined hormonal contraceptives were developed to prevent [[ovulation]] by suppressing the release of [[gonadotropin]]s. They inhibit [[follicular phase|follicular development]] and prevent ovulation as a primary mechanism of action.&lt;ref name="Nelson 2011"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Nelson|first1=Anita L.|last2=Cwiak|first2=Carrie|year=2011|chapter=Combined oral contraceptives (COCs)|editor1-last=Hatcher|editor1-first=Robert A.|editor2-last=Trussell|editor2-first=James|editor3-last=Nelson|editor3-first=Anita L.|editor4-last=Cates|editor4-first=Willard Jr.|editor5-last=Kowal|editor5-first=Deborah|editor6-last=Policar|editor6-first=Michael S.

There is no significant evidence that they work after fertilization. The progestins in all COCs provide most of the contraceptive effect by suppressing ovulation and thickening cervical mucus, although the estrogens also make a small contribution to ovulation suppression. Cycle control is enhanced by the estrogen.&lt;br/&gt;Because COCs so effectively suppress ovulation and block ascent of sperm into the upper genital tract, the potential impact on endometrial receptivity to implantation is almost academic. When the two primary mechanisms fail, the fact that pregnancy occurs despite the endometrial changes demonstrates that those endometrial changes do not significantly contribute to the pill's mechanism of action.&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Speroff 2011"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Speroff|first1=Leon|last2=Darney|first2=Philip D.|year=2011|chapter=Oral contraception|title=A clinical guide for contraception|edition=5th|location=Philadelphia|publisher=Lippincott Williams &amp; Wilkins|pages=19–152|isbn=978-1-60831-610-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Levin 2011"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Levin|first=Ellis R.|last2=Hammes|first2=Stephen R.|year=2011|chapter=Estrogens and progestins|editor1-last=Brunton|editor1-first=Laurence L.|editor2-last=Chabner|editor2-first=Bruce A.|editor3-last=Knollmann|editor3-first=Björn C.|title=Goodman &amp; Gilman's pharmacological basis of therapeutics|edition=12th|location=New York|publisher=McGraw-Hill Medical|pages=1163–1194|isbn=978-0-07-162442-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Glasier 2010"&gt;{{cite book|last=Glasier|first=Anna|year=2010|chapter=Contraception|editor1-last=Jameson|editor1-first=J.

Progestogen [[negative feedback]] decreases the pulse frequency of [[gonadotropin-releasing hormone]] (GnRH) release by the [[hypothalamus]], which decreases the release of [[follicle-stimulating hormone]] (FSH) and greatly decreases the release of [[luteinizing hormone]] (LH) by the [[anterior pituitary]]. Decreased levels of FSH inhibit follicular development, preventing an increase in [[estradiol]] levels. Progestogen negative feedback and the lack of estrogen [[positive feedback]] on LH release prevent a [[menstrual cycle|mid-cycle]] LH surge. Inhibition of follicular development and the absence of a LH surge prevent ovulation.&lt;ref name="Nelson 2011"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Speroff 2011"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Levin 2011"/&gt;

Estrogen was originally included in oral contraceptives for better cycle control (to stabilize the endometrium and thereby reduce the incidence of breakthrough bleeding), but was also found to inhibit follicular development and help prevent ovulation. Estrogen negative feedback on the anterior pituitary greatly decreases the release of FSH, which inhibits follicular development and helps prevent ovulation.&lt;ref name="Nelson 2011"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Speroff 2011"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Levin 2011"/&gt;

Another primary mechanism of action of all progestogen-containing contraceptives is inhibition of [[spermatozoon|sperm]] penetration through the [[cervix]] into the upper [[female reproductive system (human)|genital tract]] ([[uterus]] and [[fallopian tube]]s) by decreasing the amount of and increasing the [[viscosity]] of the [[cervical mucus]].&lt;ref name="Nelson 2011"/&gt;

The estrogen and progestogen in combined hormonal contraceptives have other effects on the reproductive system, but these have not been shown to contribute to their contraceptive efficacy:&lt;ref name="Nelson 2011"/&gt;
* Slowing tubal motility and ova transport, which may interfere with [[human fertilization|fertilization]].
* [[Endometrium|Endometrial]] atrophy and alteration of [[metalloproteinase]] content, which may impede sperm motility and viability, or theoretically inhibit [[implantation (human embryo)|implantation]].
* Endometrial edema, which may affect implantation.

Insufficient evidence exists on whether changes in the endometrium could actually prevent implantation. The primary mechanisms of action are so effective that the possibility of fertilization during combined hormonal contraceptive use is very small. Since pregnancy occurs despite endometrial changes when the primary mechanisms of action fail, endometrial changes are unlikely to play a significant role, if any, in the observed effectiveness of combined hormonal contraceptives.&lt;ref name="Nelson 2011"/&gt;

===Progestogen-only===
The mechanism of action of progestogen-only contraceptives depends on the [[progestogen]] activity and dose.&lt;ref name="Glasier 2010"/&gt;

Low dose progestogen-only contraceptives include traditional progestogen-only pills, the subdermal implant [[Jadelle]] and the [[intrauterine system]] Mirena. These contraceptives inconsistently inhibit ovulation in ~50% of cycles and rely mainly on their progestogenic effect of thickening the [[cervical mucus]] and thereby reducing sperm viability and penetration.

Intermediate dose progestogen-only contraceptives, such as the progestogen-only pill Cerazette (or the subdermal implant [[Implanon]]), allow some follicular development but much more consistently inhibit ovulation in 97–99% of cycles. The same cervical mucus changes occur as with low dose progestogens.

High dose progestogen-only contraceptives, such as the injectables [[Depo-Provera]] and Noristerat, completely inhibit follicular development and ovulation. The same cervical mucus changes occur as with very low dose and intermediate dose progestogens.

In [[anovulation|anovulatory cycles]] using progestogen-only contraceptives, the endometrium is thin and atrophic. If the endometrium was also thin and atrophic during an ovulatory cycle, this could theoretically interfere with implantation of a blastocyst (embryo).

===Ormeloxifene===
Ormeloxifene does not affect ovulation. It has been shown to increase the rate of [[blastocyst]] development and to increase the speed at which the blastocyst is moved from the [[fallopian tube]]s into the uterus. Ormeloxifene also suppresses proliferation and [[decidualization]] of the [[endometrium]] (the transformation of the endometrium in preparation for possible implantation of an embryo).&lt;ref name="centron"&gt;{{cite web |title=Centchroman |work=Reproductive Health Online |year=2003 |url=http://www.reproline.jhu.edu/english/1fp/1advances/old/1centch/ceorvw.htm |accessdate=2009-08-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; While they are believed to prevent [[Implantation (human embryo)|implantation]] rather than [[Human fertilization|fertilization]], exactly how these effects operate to prevent pregnancy is not understood.

==Frequency of use==
Pills—combined and progestogen-only—are the most common form of hormonal contraception. Worldwide, they account for 12% of contraceptive use. 21% of users of reversible contraceptives choose COCPs or POPs. Pills are especially popular in more developed countries, where they account for 25% of contraceptive use.&lt;!--

In 1921, [[Ludwig Haberlandt]] demonstrated a temporary hormonal contraception in a female rabbit by transplanting ovaries from a second, pregnant, animal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Müller-Jahncke WD | title = Ludwig Haberlandt (1885-1932) and the development of hormonal contraception | language = German| journal = Z Gesamte Inn Med | volume = 43 | issue = 15 | pages = 420–2 | date = Aug 1988 | pmid = 3051743 | url = | laysummary = | oclc = | id = | bibcode = | accessdate = | location = GERMANY, EAST | laydate = | format = | quote = | publisher = | issn = 0044-2542 | laysource = }}&lt;/ref&gt; By the 1930s, scientists had isolated and determined the structure of the [[steroid hormones]] and found that high doses of [[androgens]], [[estrogen]]s, or [[progesterone]] inhibited [[ovulation]].&lt;!--

In 1960, the U.S. [[Food and Drug Administration]] approved an application that allowed Enovid to be marketed as a contraceptive.&lt;!--

Combined contraceptives have also been made available in a variety of forms.

[[File:Hans Holbein the Younger - The Ambassadors - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|[[Hans Holbein the Younger|Holbein]]'s ''[[The Ambassadors (Holbein)|The Ambassadors]]'' is a complex work whose iconography remains the subject of debate.]]

'''Iconography''', as a branch of [[art history]], studies the identification, description, and the interpretation of the content of images: the subjects depicted, the particular compositions and details used to do so, and other elements that are distinct from [[artistic style]]. The word ''iconography'' comes from the [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] {{lang|grc|εἰκών}} ("image") and {{lang|grc|γράφειν}} ("to write").

A secondary meaning (based on a non-standard translation of the Greek and Russian equivalent terms) is the production of religious images, called "icons", in the [[Byzantine art|Byzantine]] and [[Eastern Orthodox Churches|Orthodox Christian]] tradition (see [[Icon]]).

In [[art history]], "an iconography" may also mean a particular depiction of a subject in terms of the content of the image, such as the number of figures used, their placing and gestures.  The term is also used in many academic fields other than art history, for example [[semiotics]] and [[media studies]], and in general usage, for the content of images, the typical depiction in images of a subject, and related senses.  Sometimes distinctions have been made between ''[[iconology]]'' and ''iconography'',&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.oxfordbibliographies.com/view/document/obo-9780195399301/obo-9780195399301-0161.xml Oxford Bibliographies: Paul Taylor, "Iconology and Iconography"]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://tems.umn.edu/pdf/Panofsky_iconology2.pdf Erwin Panofsky, ''Studies in Iconology: Humanistic Themes in the Art of the Renaissance''. Oxford 1939.]&lt;/ref&gt; although the definitions, and so the distinction made, varies. 
When referring to movies, genres are immediately recognizable through their iconography, motifs that become associated with a specific genre through repetition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last= Giannetti|first= Louis|title= Understanding Movies|year= 2008|publisher= Person Prentice Hall|location= Toronto|page= 52}}

==Iconography as a field of study==

=== Foundations of iconography ===
Early Western writers who took special note of the content of images include [[Giorgio Vasari]], whose ''Ragionamenti'', interpreting the paintings in the [[Palazzo Vecchio]] in [[Florence]], reassuringly demonstrates that such works were difficult to understand even for well-informed contemporaries.  [[Gian Pietro Bellori]], a 17th-century biographer of artists of his own time, describes and analyses, not always correctly, many works. [[Gotthold Ephraim Lessing|Lessing]]'s study (1796) of the classical figure [[Cupid|Amor]] with an inverted torch was an early attempt to use a study of a type of image to explain the culture it originated in, rather than the other way round.&lt;ref name="Białostocki:535"&gt;Białostocki:535&lt;/ref&gt;  
[[File:Hans Memling 056.jpg|thumb|A painting with complex iconography: [[Hans Memling]]'s so-called [[Seven Joys of the Virgin]] – in fact this is a later title for a ''[[Life of the Virgin]]'' cycle on a single panel.  Altogether 25 scenes, not all involving the Virgin, are depicted. 1480, [[Alte Pinakothek]], Munich.&lt;ref&gt;Alte Pinakotek, Munich; (Summary Catalogue – various authors), pp. 348-51, 1986, Edition Lipp, {{ISBN|3-87490-701-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
Iconography as an academic art historical discipline developed in the nineteenth-century in the works of scholars such as [[Adolphe Napoleon Didron]] (1806–1867), [[Anton Heinrich Springer]] (1825–1891), and [[Émile Mâle]] (1862–1954)&lt;ref name="kleinbauer"&gt;W. Eugene Kleinbauer and Thomas P. Slavens, ''Research Guide to the History of Western Art'', Sources of information in the humanities, no. 2. Chicago: [[American Library Association]] (1982): 60-72.&lt;/ref&gt; all specialists in Christian religious art, which was the main focus of study in this period, in which French scholars were especially prominent.&lt;ref name="Białostocki:535"/&gt;  They looked back to earlier attempts to classify and organise subjects encyclopedically like [[Cesare Ripa]]'s ''Iconologia overo Descrittione Dell’imagini Universali cavate dall’Antichità et da altri luoghi '' and [[Anne Claude Philippe de Tubieres de Grimoard de Pestels de Levis, Comte de Caylus|Anne Claude Philippe de Caylus]]'s ''Recueil d'antiquités égyptiennes, étrusques, grècques, romaines et gauloises'' as guides to understanding works of art, both religious and profane, in a more scientific manner than the popular [[aesthetic]] approach of the time.&lt;ref name="kleinbauer" /&gt; These early contributions paved the way for [[encyclopedia]]s, manuals, and other publications useful in identifying the content of art.  Mâle's  ''l'Art religieux du XIIIe siècle en France'' (originally 1899, with revised editions) translated into English as ''The Gothic Image, Religious Art in France of the Thirteenth Century'' has remained continuously in print.

=== Twentieth-century iconography ===
In the early-twentieth century [[Germany]], [[Aby Warburg]] (1866–1929) and his followers [[Fritz Saxl]] (1890–1948) and [[Erwin Panofsky]] (1892–1968) elaborated the practice of identification and classification of motifs in images to using iconography as a means to understanding meaning.&lt;ref name="kleinbauer" /&gt; Panofsky codified an influential approach to iconography in his 1939 ''Studies in Iconology'', where he defined it as "the branch of the history of art which concerns itself with the subject matter or meaning of works of art, as opposed to form,"&lt;ref name="kleinbauer" /&gt; although the distinction he and other scholars drew between particular definitions of "iconography" (put simply, the identification of visual content) and "iconology" (the analysis of the meaning of that content), has not been generally accepted, though it is still used by some writers.&lt;ref&gt;For example by [[Anne D'Alleva]] in her ''Methods and Theories of Art History'', pp. 20-28, 2005, Laurence King Publishing, {{ISBN|1-85669-417-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[United States]], to which Panofsky immigrated in 1931, students such as [[Frederick Hartt]], and [[Meyer Schapiro]] continued under his influence in the discipline.&lt;ref name="kleinbauer" /&gt;  In an influential article of 1942, ''Introduction to an "Iconography of Mediaeval Architecture"'',&lt;ref&gt;Richard Krautheimer,Introduction to an "Iconography of Mediaeval Architecture", Journal of the Warburg and Courtauld Institutes, Vol. 5. (1942), pp. 1-33.[http://aar.iec.cat/institucio/societats/AmicsArtRomanic/activitats/textosesp/espanol04.pdf Online text] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080408194332/http://aar.iec.cat/institucio/societats/AmicsArtRomanic/activitats/textosesp/espanol04.pdf |date=April 8, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Richard Krautheimer]], a specialist on early medieval churches and another German émigré, extended iconographical analysis to [[architecture|architectural forms]].

The period from 1940 can be seen as one where iconography was especially prominent in art history.&lt;ref&gt;Białostocki:537&lt;/ref&gt;  Whereas most icongraphical scholarship remains highly dense and specialized, some analyses began to attract a much wider audience, for example [[Erwin Panofsky|Panofsky]]'s theory (now generally out of favour with specialists) that the writing on the rear wall in the ''[[Arnolfini Portrait]]'' by [[Jan van Eyck]] turned the painting into the record of a marriage contract.  [[Hans Holbein the Younger|Holbein]]'s ''[[The Ambassadors (Holbein)|The Ambassadors]]'' has been the subject of books for a general market with new theories as to its iconography,&lt;ref&gt;Most recently: North, John (September, 2004). The Ambassador's Secret: Holbein and the World of the Renaissance. Orion Books&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[best-seller]]s of [[Dan Brown]] include theories, disowned by most art historians, on the iconography of works by [[Leonardo da Vinci]].

Technological advances allowed the building-up of huge collections of photographs, with an iconographic arrangement or index, which include those of the [[Warburg Institute]] and the ''Index of Christian Art'' at [[Princeton University|Princeton]] (which has made a specialism of iconography since its early days in America).&lt;ref&gt;Białostocki:538-39&lt;/ref&gt; These are now being digitised and made available online, usually on a restricted basis.
 
With the arrival of computing, the [[Iconclass]] system, a highly complex way of classifying the content of images, with 28,000 classification types, and 14,000 keywords, was developed in the Netherlands as a standard classification for recording collections, with the idea of assembling huge databases that will allow the retrieval of images featuring particular details, subjects or other common factors.  For example, the Iconclass code "71H7131" is for the subject of "[[Bathsheba]] (alone) with David's letter", whereas "71" is the whole "[[Old Testament]]" and "71H" the "story of [[David]]".   A number of collections of different types have been classified using Iconclass, notably many types of [[old master print]], the collections of the [[Gemäldegalerie, Berlin]] and the German [[Marburger Index]].  These are available, usually on-line or on [[DVD]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iconclass.nl/ |title=Iconclass website |publisher=Iconclass.nl |date= |accessdate=2014-03-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kb.nl/manuscripts/browser/index.html Illuminated manuscripts from the Dutch royal Library, browsable by ICONCLASS classification] and [http://www.rosspub.com/iconclass.htm Ross Publishing - examples of databases for sale] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080220200839/http://www.kb.nl/manuscripts/browser/index.html |date=February 20, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The system can also be used outside pure art history, for example on sites like [[Flickr]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iconclass.org/flickr website Iconclass for Flickr]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Iconography in religious art ===
[[Religious images]] are used to some extent by all major religions, including both [[Indian religions|Indian]] and [[Abrahamic religion|Abrahamic]] faiths, and often contain highly complex iconography, which reflects centuries of accumulated tradition.

=== Iconography in Indian religious art ===
Central to the iconography and [[hagiography]] of [[Indian religions]] are [[mudra]] or gestures with specific meanings.  Other features include the [[aureola]] and [[halo (religious iconography)|halo]], also found in Christian and Islamic art, and divine qualities and attributes represented by [[asana]] and ritual tools such as the [[dharmachakra]], [[vajra]], [[dadar]], [[chhatra]], [[sauwastika]], [[phurba]] and [[danda]].  The symbolic use of colour to denote the [[Classical Elements]] or [[Mahabhuta]] and letters and [[Bīja|bija]] syllables from sacred alphabetic scripts are other features.  Under the influence of [[tantra]] art developed esoteric meanings, accessible only to initiates; this is an especially strong feature of [[Tibetan art]]. The art of Indian Religions esp. Hindus in its numerous sectoral divisions is governed by sacred texts called the [[Aagama]] which describes the ratio and proportion of the icon, called ''taalmaana'' as well as mood of the central figure in a context. For example, [[Narasimha]] an incarnation of [[Vishnu]] though considered a wrathful deity but in few contexts is depicted in pacified mood.

Although iconic depictions of, or concentrating on, a single figure are the dominant type of [[Buddhist]] image, large stone [[bas-relief|relief]] or [[fresco]] narrative cycles of the ''Life of the Buddha'', or tales of his previous lives, are found at major sites like [[Sarnath]], [[Ajanta Caves|Ajanta]], and [[Borobudor]], especially in earlier periods.  Conversely, in [[Hindu]] art, narrative scenes have become rather more common in recent centuries, especially in [[Indian miniature painting|miniature paintings]] of the lives of [[Krishna]] and [[Rama]].

=== Christian iconography ===
{{further|Christian art| Eastern Orthodox iconography|Marian art in the Catholic Church}}
After an early period when [[Aniconism in Christianity|aniconism was strong]],&lt;ref&gt;[[Ernst Kitzinger|Kitzinger, Ernst]], "The Cult of Images in the Age before Iconoclasm", ''Dumbarton Oaks Papers'', Vol. 8, (1954), pp.&amp;nbsp;83–150, Dumbarton Oaks, Trustees for Harvard University, [https://www.jstor.org/stable/1291064 JSTOR]&lt;/ref&gt; surviving [[Early Christian art]] began, about two centuries after Christ, with small images in the [[Catacombs of Rome]] that show [[orans]] figures, portraits of Christ and some saints, and a limited number of "abbreviated representations" of biblical episodes emphasizing deliverance.  From the Constantinian period monumental art borrowed motifs from Roman Imperial imagery, classical Greek and Roman religion and popular art – the motif of [[Christ in Majesty]] owes something to both Imperial portraits and depictions of [[Zeus]].  In the [[Late Antique]] period iconography began to be standardised, and to relate more closely to [[Biblical]] texts, although many gaps in the [[canonical Gospel]] narratives were plugged with matter from the [[apocrypha|apocryphal gospels]].  Eventually the Church would succeed in weeding most of these out, but some remain, like the ox and ass in the [[Nativity of Jesus in art|Nativity of Christ]].
[[File:Tikhvinskaya.jpg|thumb|The Theotokos of [[Tikhvin]] of ca. 1300, an example of the [[Hodegetria]] type of [[Madonna and Child]].]]
After the [[Iconoclasm (Byzantine)|period of Byzantine iconoclasm]] iconographical innovation was regarded as unhealthy, if not heretical, in the Eastern Church, though it still continued at a glacial pace.  More than in the West, traditional depictions were often considered to have authentic or [[Acheiropoieta|miraculous origins]], and the job of the artist was to copy them with as little deviation as possible. The Eastern church also never accepted the use of monumental [[high relief]] or free-standing sculpture, which it found too reminiscent of paganism.  Most modern [[Eastern Orthodox]] [[icon]]s are very close to their predecessors of a thousand years ago, though development, and some shifts in meaning, have occurred – for example the old man wearing a fleece in conversation with [[Saint Joseph]] usually seen in Orthodox Nativities seems to have begun as one of the shepherds, or the prophet [[Isaiah]], but is now usually understood as the "Tempter" ([[Satan]]).&lt;ref&gt;Schiller:66&lt;/ref&gt;

In both East and West, numerous iconic types of [[Christ]], [[Mary (mother of Jesus)|Mary]] and saints and other subjects were developed; the number of named types of icons of Mary, with or without the infant Christ, was especially large in the East, whereas [[Christ Pantocrator]] was much the commonest image of Christ.  Especially important depictions of Mary include the [[Hodegetria]] and  [[Panagia]] types.  Traditional models evolved for narrative paintings, including large cycles covering the events of the Life of Christ, the [[Life of the Virgin]], parts of the Old Testament, and, increasingly, the lives of popular [[saint]]s.  Especially in the West, a system of [[emblem|attributes]] developed for [[Saint symbology|identifying individual]] figures of saints by a standard appearance and symbolic objects held by them; in the East they were more likely to identified by text labels.

From the [[Romanesque art|Romanesque]] period sculpture on churches became increasingly important in Western art, and probably partly because of the lack of Byzantine models, became the location of much iconographic innovation, along with the [[illuminated manuscript]], which had already taken a decisively different direction from Byzantine equivalents, under the influence of [[Insular art]] and other factors.  Developments in theology and devotional practice produced innovations like the subject of the [[Coronation of the Virgin]] and the [[Assumption of Mary|Assumption]], both associated with the [[Franciscan]]s, as were many other developments. Most painters remained content to copy and slightly modify the works of others, and it is clear that the clergy, by whom or for whose churches most art was commissioned, often specified what they wanted shown in great detail.

The theory of [[Typology (theology)|typology]], by which the meaning of most events of the [[Old Testament]] was understood as a "type" or pre-figuring of an event in the life of, or aspect of, Christ or Mary was often reflected in art, and in the later [[Middle Ages]] came to dominate the choice of Old Testament scenes in Western Christian art.
[[File:Robert Campin - L' Annonciation - 1425.jpg|thumb|[[Robert Campin]]'s [[Mérode Altarpiece]] of 1425-28 has a highly complex iconography that is still debated.  Is [[Saint Joseph|Joseph]] making a mousetrap, reflecting a remark of Saint [[Augustine of Hippo|Augustine]] that Christ's Incarnation was a trap to catch men's souls?]] 
Whereas in the Romanesque and [[Gothic art|Gothic]] periods the great majority of religious art was intended to convey often complex religious messages as clearly as possible, with the arrival of [[Early Netherlandish painting]] iconography became highly sophisticated, and in many cases appears to be deliberately enigmatic, even for a well-educated contemporary. The subtle layers of meaning uncovered by modern iconographical research in works of [[Robert Campin]] such as the [[Mérode Altarpiece]], and of Jan van Eyck such as the [[Madonna of Chancellor Rolin]] and the [[Annunciation (van Eyck, Washington)|Washington Annunciation]] lie in small details of what are on first viewing very conventional representations.  When Italian painting developed a taste for enigma, considerably later, it most often showed in secular compositions influenced by [[Platonism in the Renaissance|Renaissance Neo-Platonism]].

From the 15th century religious painting gradually freed itself from the habit of following earlier compositional models, and by the 16th century ambitious artists were expected to find novel compositions for each subject, and direct borrowings from earlier artists are more often of the poses of individual figures than of whole compositions.  The [[The Reformation and art|Reformation]] soon restricted most [[Protestant]] religious painting to Biblical scenes conceived along the lines of [[history painting]], and after some decades the Catholic [[Council of Trent]] reined in somewhat the freedom of Catholic artists.

=== Secular Western painting ===
Secular painting became far more common from the Renaissance, and developed its own traditions and conventions of iconography, in [[history painting]], which includes [[mythology|mythologies]], [[portrait painting|portraits]], [[genre painting|genre scenes]], and even [[landscape painting|landscapes]], not to mention modern media and genres like [[photography]], [[Film|cinema]], [[political cartoon]]s, [[comic book]]s and [[anime]].

Renaissance mythological painting was in theory reviving the iconography of the ancient world, but in practice themes like [[Leda and the Swan]] developed on largely original lines, and for different purposes.  Personal iconographies, where works appear to have significant meanings individual to, and perhaps only accessible by, the artist, go back at least as far as [[Hieronymous Bosch]], but have become increasingly significant with artists like [[Goya]], [[William Blake]], [[Paul Gauguin|Gauguin]], [[Picasso]], [[Frida Kahlo]] and [[Joseph Beuys]].

== Iconography in disciplines other than art history{{anchor|iconography and popular culture}} ==
Iconography, often of aspects of [[popular culture]], is a concern of other [[academic disciplines]] including [[Semiotics]], [[Anthropology]], [[Sociology]], [[Media Studies]] and [[Cultural Studies]].  These analyses in turn have affected conventional art history, especially concepts such as [[sign (semiotics)|signs in semiotics]].  Discussing imagery as iconography in this way implies a critical "reading" of imagery that often attempts to explore social and cultural values. Iconography is also used within [[Film theory|film studies]] to describe the [[visual language]] of cinema, particularly within the field of [[Film genre|genre criticism]].&lt;ref name="film"&gt;Cook and Bernink (1999, 138-140).&lt;/ref&gt; In the age of Internet, the new global history of the visual production of Humanity (Histiconologia &lt;ref&gt;The first World Dictionary of Images: Laurent Gervereau (ed.), "Dictionnaire mondial des images", Paris, Nouveau monde, 2006, 1120p, {{ISBN|978-2-84736-185-8}}.

{{DISPLAYTITLE:''Index Fungorum''}}
'''''Index Fungorum''''' is an international project to index all formal names ([[Binomial nomenclature|scientific name]]s) in the [[Fungus]] [[Kingdom (biology)|Kingdom]]. {{as of|2015}} the project is based at the [[Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew]], one of three partners along with [[Landcare Research New Zealand Limited|Landcare Research]] and the Institute of Microbiology, [[Chinese Academy of Sciences]].

It is somewhat comparable to the [[International Plant Names Index]] (IPNI), in which the Royal Botanic Gardens is also involved. A difference is that where IPNI does not indicate [[Correct name (botany)|correct name]]s, the ''Index Fungorum'' does indicate the status of a name.  In the returns from the search page a currently correct name is indicated in green, while others are in blue (a few, aberrant usages of names are indicated in red).  All names are linked to pages giving the correct name, with lists of [[Synonym (taxonomy)|synonym]]s.

Index Fungorum is one of three nomenclatural repositories recognized by the [[Nomenclature Committee for Fungi]]; the others are ''[[MycoBank]]'' and ''[[Fungal Names]]''.&lt;ref name="Redhead 2013"/&gt;

==Current names in ''Index Fungorum'' (''Species Fungorum'')==
The main part of ''Index Fungorum'' is intended to be a global list of all fungus names which have ever been validly defined, but many of them are conflicting or no longer used.  ''Species Fungorum'' is a closely related project based at the [[w:Royal Botanical Gardens, Kew|Royal Botanical Gardens, Kew]] supported by [[w:CABI (organisation)|CABI]] to decide a consistent subset of the ''Index Fungorum'' names which can be recommended as currently valid.  It is possible to search in either the ''Index Fungorum'' or the ''Species Fungorum'' list separately and the ''Index Fungorum'' results also give a cross-reference to ''Species Fungorum'' where an entry is available - names without such a reference are generally only of historical interest and should not be considered reliable for present use.&lt;ref name=IF&gt;See the pop-up "Help with searching" at {{cite web |url=http://www.indexfungorum.org/Names/Names.asp |title=''Index Fungorum'' home page|work=Index Fungorum|publisher=Royal Botanic Gardens Kew |accessdate=2016-10-25}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=SF&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.speciesfungorum.org/ |title=''Species Fungorum'' home page|work=Species Fungorum |publisher=Royal Botanic Gardens Kew |accessdate=2016-10-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Life Science Identifiers (LSIDs)==
''Index Fungorum'' provides [[LSID|Life Science Identifiers (LSIDs)]] for records in its database.

==Services==
''Index Fungorum'' provides a [[SOAP]] protocol [[web service]] for searching its database and retrieving records. A [[Web Services Description Language|WSDL]] file describing the services is available.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.indexfungorum.org/IXFWebService/Fungus.asmx|title=Fungus Web Service|website=www.indexfungorum.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Institute of Aesthetic Research''' ('''Instituto de Investigaciones Estéticas''') of the [[National Autonomous University of Mexico]], since its foundation in 1936, research has been carried out in its installations into the [[Mexican art|different forms of artistic expression in Mexico]]; the diversity of studies undertaken by the body of researchers in the fields of criticism, theory and history of art across a horizon that reaches other latitudes. It has thus become a space in which the plastic arts converge with dance, literature, photography, cinema and music.

Every year, through its International Colloquium on Art History, the Institute opens its doors to academic reflection on the history of art. Since 1975, this space has been a meeting point for the voices of both Mexican and foreign researchers.

To perform its tasks of study and dissemination, both of Mexican art and that of other countries, the Institute harbors a number of different areas, each of which has its particular sphere of interest:
*The Manuel Toussaint Photographic Archive conserves the collections of images which serve as a support for academic activities. With over 750,000 images, the Archive grown to be the country’s most important depositary of visual documents related to Mexican art; it also has a specialized conservation laboratory. The tasks carried out in the Archive range from the lending of materials for consultation to the organization of photographic exhibitions for museums in Mexico and abroad.
*The collection of the Justino Fernández Library is the most important and extensive in Latin America as regards material devoted to the study of art. It provides an invaluable support for research through its programs of donations and exchanges of books and interlibrary interchange and loans; it also participates, by means of its book and periodical collections, in different exhibitions and in the production of television programs.
*The Documentary Investigation Department carries out research activities in different archives in Mexico. Its labors are concentrated in the Catalogues of art documents. These tools help to orient the Institute’s investigations and represent a significant labor of collaboration in its output.
*The Laboratory for Diagnosis of Works of Art participates in projects aimed at researching and conserving the national artistic heritage, by means of the analysis of materials and procedures used in the creation of works of art.
*In December, 2007, the Hypermedia Laboratory commenced its activities. In it are concentrated the Institute community’s interests in exploiting the possibilities of digital technology for the study, investigation and dissemination of art history.
*The most important medium for disseminating the Institute’s research are printed books. Every title published by the Publications Department is an endorsement of the Institute’s commitment to maintaining the exceptional quality that has been attained by its printed media. In this effort it is accompanied by the journal Anales del Instituto de Investigaciones Estéticas, which, twice-yearly, offers in its pages the work of prestigious researchers from all over the world.

The distribution of the Institute’s publications is not limited to the UNAM’s system of libraries, but extends to other sales outlets. The electronic shop, still under construction, is also oriented towards the same /will also make a contribution to this effort, bringing the Institute’s work to a broader public.

The journal Imágenes is an electronic publication which offers various articles publicizing the Institute’s academic activities and other news items to do with the history of art. Its contents and characteristics have made it the most visited section of the Institute’s electronic portal.

In August, 2007, work started at the new branch headquarters of the Instituto de Investigaciones Estéticas in the City of Oaxaca, which are lodged in an old domestic building in the Alameda de León, which dates from the eighteenth century and was received by the UNAM in commodatum in 2005.

This branch is home to a library—comprising over six thousand volumes—which belonged to Dr. Beatriz de la Fuente, among which are some facsimiles of [[pre-Hispanic codices]]. The library is endowed with the necessary features for operating as a videoconference room. The equipment installed is similar to that in the Francisco de la Maza room in the Institute’s headquarters on the University campus in Mexico City, thus facilitating constant communication between both. It is to be hoped that this study center will become a point of reference for the south of the country and for the whole of Central America.

Dr. '''J. Halcombe "Hal" Laning, Jr.''' (February 14, 1920 in [[Kansas City, Missouri|Kansas City]], [[Missouri]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.answers.com/topic/1953 1953: Information from Answers.com]&lt;/ref&gt; &amp;ndash; May 29, 2012) was a [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]] computer pioneer who in 1952 invented an algebraic compiler called George (also known as the [[Laning and Zierler system]] after the authors of the published paper) that ran on the MIT [[Whirlwind (computer)|Whirlwind]], the first real-time computer.&lt;ref&gt;[https://history.nasa.gov/sts1/pages/computer.html NASA - The Flight of STS-1: Computer]&lt;/ref&gt; Laning designed George to be an easier-to-use alternative to [[assembly language]] for entering mathematical equations into a computer.  The concepts he introduced with George were later incorporated into [[FORTRAN]].&lt;ref&gt;Mindell, David, DIGITAL APOLLO, MIT Press, Cambridge, MA, 2008, p.99&lt;/ref&gt; He later became a key contributor to the 1960s race to the moon, with pioneering work on space-based guidance systems for the [[Apollo missions|Apollo moon missions]]. From 1955 to 1980, he was deputy associate director of the [[MIT Instrumentation Laboratory]].

In 1956 he published the book ''Random Processes in Automatic Control'' (McGraw-Hill Series on Control System Engineering), with Richard Battin as a coauthor.

In collaboration with Phil Hankins and Charlie Werner of MIT, he initiated work on MAC (MIT
Algebraic Compiler), an algebraic programming language for the IBM 650, which was completed by early spring of 1958.&lt;ref&gt;[[Guidance system]]&lt;/ref&gt;
==Career==
Laning received his PhD from MIT in 1947 with a dissertation titled "Mathematical Theory of Lubrication-Type Flow".&lt;ref&gt;{{MathGenealogy|id=33485|name=J. Halcombe Laning, Jr}}&lt;/ref&gt; His undergraduate degree in Chemical Engineering (1940) was also from MIT.&lt;ref&gt;[http://webmuseum.mit.edu/detail.php?t=people&amp;type=browse&amp;f=preferred_name&amp;s=Laning%2C+J.+Halcombe&amp;record=0 MIT Museum Collections - People]&lt;/ref&gt;

He was elected to the [[National Academy of Engineering]] in 1983 for his work in [[aerospace engineering]], particularly his "unique pioneering achievements in missile guidance and computer science -- the [[Q-guidance]] system for [[Thor missile|Thor]] and [[polaris missile|Polaris]] [missiles] and George".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nae.edu/nae/naepub.nsf/Members+By+UNID/91CB3C1EF7430AFF8625755200622AE5?opendocument |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-07-28 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100528132256/http://www.nae.edu/nae/naepub.nsf/Members+By+UNID/91CB3C1EF7430AFF8625755200622AE5?opendocument |archivedate=May 28, 2010 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; He was also an honorary member of the [[American Mathematical Society]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ams.org/notices/199512/from.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

Laning features prominently in the third episode of the [[Science Channel]]'s [[documentary]] miniseries titled [[Moon_machines#Part_3:_Guidance_Computer|Moon Machines]] which aired in June 2008.

=== Apollo Program ===

He later worked in the MIT [[Draper Lab]], with [[Richard Battin|Richard H. Battin]], to develop a scheme for doing onboard navigation on the [[Apollo program]]'s [[Apollo Command/Service Module|command/service module]] [[guidance systems|guidance system]].  He designed the Executive and Waitlist operating system for the [[apollo guidance computer|LGC]] (Lunar Module Guidance Computer) in the mid 1960s; he made it up from whole cloth with no examples to guide him, and the design is still valid today. The allocation of functions among a sensible number of asynchronous processes, under control of a rate and priority-driven preemptive executive, still represents the state of the art in real-time GN&amp;C computers for spacecraft.  His design saved the Apollo 11 landing mission when the rendezvous radar interface program began using more register core sets and "Vector Accumulator" areas than were physically available in memory, causing the infamous 1201 and 1202 errors.

'''Kairos''' ({{lang|grc|[[wikt:καιρός#Ancient Greek|καιρός]]}}) is an [[Ancient Greek]] word meaning the right, critical, or opportune moment.&lt;ref&gt;Liddell and Scott, Greek-English Lexicon.&lt;/ref&gt;  The ancient Greeks had two words for [[time]]: [[chronos]] ({{lang|grc|[[wikt:χρόνος#Ancient Greek|χρόνος]]}}) and kairos. The former refers to [[chronology|chronological]] or sequential [[time]], while the latter signifies a proper or opportune time for action. While chronos is quantitative, kairos has a qualitative, permanent nature.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3Dkairo%2Fs1 |title=(Dictionary Entry) |work=Henry George Liddell, Robert Scott, A Greek-English Lexicon |accessdate=2015-07-13 }}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Kairos'' also means ''weather'' in [[Modern Greek]]. The plural, καιροί (''kairoi'' (Ancient and Modern Greek)) means ''the times''. Kairos is a term, idea, and practice that has been applied in several fields including classical rhetoric, modern rhetoric, digital media, Christian theology, and science.

==Origins==
In [[Richard Broxton Onians|Onians']] 1951 etymological studies of the word, he traces the primary root back to the ancient Greek association with both [[archery]] and [[weaving]]. In archery, kairos denotes the moment in which an arrow may be fired with sufficient force to penetrate a target. In weaving, kairos denotes the moment in which the [[Shuttle (weaving)|shuttle]] could be passed through threads on the [[loom]].&lt;ref&gt;Stephenson,Hunter W. (2005) "Forecasting Opportunity: Kairos, Production, and Writing, p.4. University Press of America: Oxford&lt;/ref&gt;

In the literature of the classical period, writers and orators used kairos to specify moments when the opportune action was made, often through metaphors involving archery and one’s ability to aim and fire at the exact right time on-target. For example, in [[The Suppliants (Euripides)|The Suppliants]], a drama written by [[Euripides]], [[Adrastus]] describes the ability to influence and change another person’s mind by “aiming their bow beyond the kairos.”

Kairos is also an alternate spelling of the minor Greek deity Caerus, the god of luck and opportunity.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Thompson|first=Gary|date=2012|title=Electronic Kairos|url=https://umaryland-on-worldcat-org.proxy-um.researchport.umd.edu/atoztitles/link?genre=article&amp;atitle=Electronic%20Kairos.&amp;title=At%20the%20Interface%20/%20Probing%20the%20Boundaries&amp;issn=15707113&amp;isbn=&amp;volume=83&amp;issue=&amp;date=20120901&amp;aulast=Thompson%2C%20Gary&amp;spage=3&amp;pages=3-13&amp;sid=EBSCO:Communication%20%26%20Mass%20Media%20Complete|journal=At the Interface / Probing the Boundaries|volume=83|pages=3–13|via=MLA International Bibliography}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In classical rhetoric==
In [[rhetoric]], ''kairos'' is "a passing instant when an opening appears which must be driven through with force if success is to be achieved."&lt;ref&gt;E. C. White, ''Kaironomia'' p. 13&lt;/ref&gt;

Kairos was central to the [[Sophists]], who stressed the rhetor's ability to adapt to and take advantage of changing, contingent circumstances. In ''Panathenaicus'', [[Isocrates]] writes that educated people are those “who manage well the circumstances which they encounter day by day, and who possess a judgment which is accurate in meeting occasions as they arise and rarely misses the expedient course of action".

Kairos is also very important in [[Aristotle]]'s scheme of rhetoric. Kairos is, for Aristotle, the time and space context in which the [[Proof (truth)|proof]] will be delivered. Kairos stands alongside other contextual elements of rhetoric: ''The Audience'', which is the psychological and emotional makeup of those who will receive the proof; and ''To Prepon'', which is the style with which the orator clothes the proof.

In Ancient Greece, "kairos" was utilized by both of the two main schools of thought in the field of rhetoric. The competing schools were that of the [[Sophists]], and that of their opposition, led by individuals such as Aristotle and [[Plato]]. Sophism approached rhetoric as an art form. Members of the school would travel around Greece teaching citizens about the art of rhetoric and successful discourse. In his article "Toward a Sophistic Definition of Rhetoric", [[John Poulakos]] defines rhetoric from a Sophistic perspective as follows: "Rhetoric is the art which seeks to capture in opportune moments that which is appropriate and attempts to suggest that which is possible."&lt;ref name="Poulakos 1983 35–48"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Poulakos|first=John|title=Toward a Sophistic Definition of Rhetoric|journal=Philosophy and Rhetoric|year=1983|volume=16|issue=1|pages=35–48}}&lt;/ref&gt; Aristotle and Plato, on the other hand, viewed Sophistic rhetoric as a tool used to manipulate others, and criticized those who taught it. 
 
Kairos fits into the Sophistic scheme of rhetoric in conjunction with the ideas of prepon and dynaton. These two terms combined with kairos are their keys to successful rhetoric. As stated by Poulakos, Prepon deals with the notion that "what is said must conform to both audience and occasion."&lt;ref name="Poulakos 1983 35–48"/&gt; Dynaton has to do with the idea of the possible, or what the speaker is attempting to convince the audience of. Kairos in the Sophistic context is based on the thought that speech must happen at a certain time in order for it to be most effective. If rhetoric is to be meaningful and successful, it must be presented at the right moment, or else it will not have the same impact on the members of the audience. 
 
Aristotle and his followers also discuss the importance of kairos in their teachings. In his ''Rhetoric'', one of the ways that Aristotle uses the idea of kairos is in reference to the specificity of each rhetorical situation. Aristotle believed that each rhetorical situation was different, and therefore different rhetorical devices needed to be applied at that point in time. One of the most well known parts of Aristotle's ''Rhetoric'' is when he discusses the roles of pathos, ethos, and logos. Aristotle ties kairos to these concepts, claiming that there are times in each rhetorical situation when one needs to be utilized over the others.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Kinneavy|first=James|author2=Catherine Eskin|title=Kairos in Aristotle's Rhetoric|journal=Written Communication|year=2000|volume=17|issue=3|pages=432–444|doi=10.1177/0741088300017003005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Kairos has classically been defined as a concept that focused on "'the uniquely timely, the spontaneous, the radically particular.'"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Paul|first1=Joanne|title=The use of Kairos in Renaissance Political Philosophy|journal=Renaissance Quarterly|date=Spring 2014|volume=67|issue=1|page=43|jstor=10.1086/676152}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Ancient Pythagoreans thought Kairos to be one of the most fundamental laws of the universe.  Kairos was said to piece together the dualistic ways of the entire universe.  [[Empedocles]] was the philosopher who connect kairos to the principle of opposites and harmony.  It then became the principle of conflict and resolution and was thus inserted as a concept for rhetoric.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1=Carter|first1=Michael |title=Stasis and Kairos: Principles of Social Construction in Classical Rhetoric|journal=Rhetoric Review|date=Autumn 1988|volume=7|issue=1|pages=101, 102|jstor=465537}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Modern rhetorical definition==
In his article "Critical-Rhetorical Ethnography: Rethinking the Place and Process of Rhetoric," Aaron Hess submits a definition of kairos for the present day that bridges the two classical applications. Hess addresses Poulakos’s view that, “In short, kairos dictates that what is said must be said at the right time.”&lt;ref name="Poulakos 1983 35–48"/&gt; He also suggests that in addition to timeliness kairos considers appropriateness. According to Hess, kairos can either be understood as, "the decorum or propriety of any given moment and speech act, implying a reliance on the given or known" or as, "the opportune, spontaneous, or timely."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hess|first=Aaron|title=Critical-Rhetorical Ethnography: Rethinking the place and Process of Rhetoric|journal=Communication Studies|year=2011|volume=62|issue=2|page=138|doi=10.1080/10510974.2011.529750}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although these two ideas of kairos might seem conflicting, Hess says that they offer a more extensive understanding of the term. Furthermore, they encourage creativity, which is necessary to adapt to unforeseen obstacles and opinions that can alter the opportune or appropriate moment, i.e. kairos. Being able to recognize the propriety of a situation while having the ability to adapt one’s rhetoric allows taking advantage of kairos to be successful. Hess’s updated definition of kairos concludes that along with taking advantage of the timeliness and appropriateness of a situation, the term also implies being knowledgeable of and involved in the environment where the situation is taking place in order to benefit fully from seizing the opportune moment.
 
Hess's conflicting perspective on kairos is exemplified by the disagreement between Lloyd F. Bitzer and Richard E. Vatz about the rhetorical situation. Bitzer argues that rhetorical situations exist independent of human perspective; a situation invites discourse. He discusses the feeling of a missed opportunity to speak (kairos) and the tendency to later create a speech in response to that unseized moment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Bitzer|first=Lloyd|title=The Rhetorical Situation|journal=Philosophy and Rhetoric|date=January 1968|volume=1|pages=1–16}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, Vatz counters Bitzer's view by claiming that a situation is made rhetorical by the perception of its interpreter and the way which they choose to respond to it, whether with discourse or not. It is the rhetor's responsibility to give an event meaning through linguistic depiction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Vatz|first=Richard|title=The Myth of the Rhetorical Situation|journal=Philosophy and Rhetoric|year=1983|volume=6.3|pages=155–60}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bitzer's and Vatz's perspectives add depth to Hess's ideas that kairos is concerned with both timeliness and appropriateness. On one hand, Bitzer's argument supports Hess's claim that kairos is spontaneous, and one must be able to recognize the situation as opportune in order to take advantage of it. On the other hand, Vatz's idea that the rhetor is responsible reinforces Hess's suggestion of the need to be knowledgeable and involved in the surrounding environment in order to fully profit from the situation.

According to Bitzer, Kairos is composed of exigence, audience, and constraints. Exigence is the inherent pressure to do something about a situation immediately, with the action required depending on the situation. The audience are the listeners who the rhetor is attempting to persuade. Constraints are the external factors that challenges the rhetors ability to influence, such as the audience’s personal beliefs and motivations.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Gelang|first=Marie|date=2012|title=Kairos, the Rhythm of Timing|url=|journal=Thamyris/Intersecting: Place, Sex &amp; Race|volume=26|pages=89–101|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Additionally, factors such as cultural background, previous social experiences, and current mood, can influence the capacity to see and understand the correct and opportune moment of action.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Thus, the difficulty of using kairos in a modern rhetorical setting is understanding and working within its constraints, while also carefully considering unexpected situations and encounters that arise, in order to present one’s rhetorical argument as naturally as possible.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

'Kairos' modern English definition is vague.  There is no one word in today's English language that completely encompasses the definition of kairos, similar to that of [[Ethos]], [[Logos]], and [[Pathos]].  In his article "The Ethics of Argument: Rereading Kairos and Making Sense in a Timely Fashion," Michael Harker says, "Like the 'points' on the rhetorical triangle, the meaning of kairos is not definitive but rather a starting point for grasping the whole of an argument."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Harker|first1=Michael|title=The Ethics of Argument: Rereading Kairos and Making Sense in a Timely Fashion|journal=College Composition and Communication|date=September 2007|volume=59|issue=1|page=80|jstor=20456982}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kairos' inclusion in modern composition has not been implicitly made, but there are undertones.  Various components of kairos are included in modern composition and have made profound effects on modern composition theory.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Harker|first1=Michael|title=The Ethics of Argument: Reread Kairos and Making Sense in a Timely Fashion|journal=College Composition and Communication|date=September 2007|volume=59|issue=1|page=85|jstor=20456982}}&lt;/ref&gt;'

Kairos' purpose in modern rhetoric is mostly focused on the placement of logos, pathos, and ethos.  Kairos is used as a "starting point" in modern rhetoric.  Kelly Pender's article "'Kairos' and the Subject of Expressive Discourse" states the inclusion of kairos within discourse "would try to shift the focus of personal writing from the writer's experiences and emotions to a broader perspective that explicitly concentrates on the rhetorical situation..."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Pender|first1=Kelly|title="Kairos" and the Subject of Expressive Discourse|journal=Composition Studies|date=Fall 2003|volume=31|issue=2|page=96|jstor=43501556}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Kairos is an expressive inclusion within the overall subject of discourse, and one that has an effect on the entire rhetoric.

==In Christian theology==
In the [[New Testament]], "kairos" means "the appointed time in the purpose of God," the time when God acts (e.g. {{bibleverse||Mark|1:15|NKJV}}: the ''kairos'' is fulfilled and the kingdom of God is at hand). "Kairos" (used 86 times in the New Testament)&lt;ref&gt;[http://biblehub.com/greek/2540.htm Strong's Greek Concordance]&lt;/ref&gt; refers to an opportune time, a "moment" or a "season" such as "harvest time," &lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse||Matthew|21:34|NKJV}}&lt;/ref&gt; whereas "chronos" (used 54 times)&lt;ref&gt;[http://biblehub.com/greek/5550.htm Strong's Greek Concordance]&lt;/ref&gt; refers to a specific amount of time, such as a day or an hour (e.g. {{bibleverse||Acts|13:18|NKJV}} and {{bibleverse-nb||Acts|27:9|NKJV}}). Jesus makes a distinction in {{bibleverse||John|7:6|NKJV}} between "His" time and "[[Brothers of Jesus|His brothers]]'" time: [[paradox]]ically, it is "always" ({{lang-gr|πάντοτε}}) his brothers' time. In the context, they can go to [[Jerusalem]] any time they wish.

In the [[Eastern Orthodox]] and [[Eastern Catholic]] churches, before the [[Divine Liturgy]] begins, the [[Deacon]] exclaims to the [[Priest]], 'Καιρὸς τοῦ ποιῆσαι τῷ Κυρίῳ' (''Kairos tou poiēsai tō Kyriō''), i.e. "It is time [''kairos''] for the Lord to act", indicating that the time of the Liturgy is an intersection with Eternity.

In ''The Interpretation of History,'' [[neo-orthodoxy|neo-orthodox]] [[Lutheran]] theologian [[Paul Tillich]] made prominent use of the term. For him, the ''kairoi'' are those crises in history (see [[Christian existentialism]]) which create an opportunity for, and indeed demand, an existential decision by the human subject - the coming of Christ being the prime example (compare [[Karl Barth]]'s use of ''Geschichte'' as opposed to ''Historie''). In the [[Kairos Document]], an example of [[liberation theology]] in [[South Africa under apartheid]], the term ''kairos'' is used to denote "the appointed time," "the crucial time" into which the document or text is spoken.

==In science==

In [[Hippocrates]]’ (460-357 B.C.E) major theoretical treatises on the nature of medical science and methodology, the term “kairos” is used within the first line. Hippocrates is generally accepted as the father of medicine, but his contribution to the discourse of science is less discussed. While “kairos” most often refers to “the right time,” Hippocrates also used to term when referencing experimentation. Using this term allowed him to “express the variable components of medical practice more accurately.” Here the word refers more to proportion, the mean, and the implicit sense of right measure.

Hippocrates most famous quote about kairos is “every kairos is a chronos, but not every chronos is a kairos.” &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Sipiora|first1=Phillip|last2=Baumlin|first2=James S.|title=Rhetoric and Kairos: Essays in History, Theory, and Praxis|date=2002|publisher=State University of New York Press|location=New York|pages=97–99|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=XZ6r7ozilPMC&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''A Rhetoric of Doing: Essays on Written Discourse in Honor of James L. Kinneavy'' by Stephen Paul Witte, Neil Nakadate, Roger Dennis Cherry also discusses the art of kairos in the field of science. Citing [[John Swales]], the essay notes that the introduction sections of scientific research articles are nothing more than the construction of openings. This idea derives from the spacial aspect of kairos, or the creation of "an opening," which can be created by writers and discovered by readers. This opening is the opportune time, or kairos. Swales created what he called the "create a research space" model, wherein kairos, or an opening, was constructed. It consisted of four rhetorical moves. 1.) establishing the field. 2.) summarizing previous research. 3.) preparing for present research, and 4.) introducing the present research. The third step is one where a gap in previous research is indicated, thus creating the need for more information. The writer constructs a need, and an opening. Because kairos emphasizes change, it is an important aspect of science. Not all scientific research can be presented at the same time or in the same way, but creating an opening makes it possible to construct the right time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Witte|first1=Stephen|last2=Nakadate|first2=Neil|last3=Cherry|first3=Roger|title=A Rhetoric of Doing: Essays on Written Discourse in Honor of James L. Kinneavy|date=1992|publisher=SIU Press|pages=312–313|url=https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;id=EpA3cTT6iskC&amp;oi=fnd&amp;pg=PA310&amp;dq=kairos+&amp;ots=L_mQnkEhmb&amp;sig=71BXqclQo_v5Tk0uuUEfTDYZqIQ#v=onepage&amp;q=kairos&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This can easily be related back to Hippocrates statement that not every opening is an opportunity. Yet, in science, the message can be adapted in such a way that chronos becomes kairos.

The idea can also be expressed in the words of Carolyn M. Glasshoff who wrote that, specifically in the field of scientific writing, “any text must be influenced by the kairos that exists both before the text is created and during the presentation. In addition, each text helps create a new kairos for texts that come after.” &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Glasshoff|first1=Carolyn M.|title=Gore 's Science The Kairos Of An Inconvenient Truth And The Implications For Science Writing|url=http://stars.library.ucf.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=2928&amp;context=etd|website=University of Central Florida STARS|publisher=University of Central Florida}}&lt;/ref&gt;
== Kairos in digital media ==
The historical context of the definition of kairos may make the concept appear outdated. However, the relevancy of kairos is at its peak as the world has rapidly transformed into a society dependent on digital technology. In order to recognize how kairos can be applied to online media and the challenges that occur as a result, a broad definition of the term is required. One definition makes the application of kairos to digital media easy to recognize, as it states kairos can be referred to as particular moment in which success is achieved when an opening is pursued with force.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Sheridan|first=David|date=2009|title=Kairos and New Media:  Toward a Theory and Practice of Visual Activism|url=http://enculturation.net/6.2/sheridan-michel-ridolfo|journal=Enculturation|volume=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; This definition prompts a main issue within the application of kairos to online content: if timing is crucial to the message of communication that is being received, how can we communicate effectively online, where anything can be published at any time?

The difficulty with modern rhetoric in the digital space is that the audience is less easily influenced by the rhetor. As such, it is difficult for rhetors to utilize kairos to the best of their abilities. Due to the nature of which modern audiences in the electronic age consume media, it is highly possible that they are multi-tasking, with their attention divided among multiple sources. This difficulty is compounded with the fact that this audience can consume discourse at different times, in different places, and through varying mediums. As a result, the audience is able to assign encountered discourse at various levels of personal priority. With this, they are able to discern which discourse they think is vital or interesting, and discard those they deem trivial or unworthy of their attention.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

There are also multiple external factors that lead to the difficulty in using kairos in a modern setting. Since computer hardware, software, and even the underlying operating system all differ between people, it is difficult for the orator to take account for every permutation possible. Couple this with the lack of a true shared community online, since such virtual “cloakroom communities” are only temporary, and the difficulties in using kairos in the digital age becomes painfully clear.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Some scholars studying kairos in the modern digital sphere argue that the aspects of body/ identity, distribution/ circulation, access/ accessibility, interaction, and economics are handled differently in an online setting and therefore messages that are sent digitally need to be altered to fit the new circumstances. In order to reach online audiences effectively, scholars suggest that context of the information's use, which includes considerations of legal, health-related, disciplinary, and political factors paired with smart rhetorical thinking can solve the issue of miscommunicated messages distributed on online forums.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Porter|first=James|date=2009|title=Recovering Delivery for Digital Rhetoric|url=https://summitsguide.files.wordpress.com/2017/01/porter_recovering-delivery-for-digital-rhetoric.pdf|journal=Computers and Composition|volume=26|pages=207–224|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Germigny Des Pres 2007 01.jpg|thumb|Mosaic of the [[Ark of the Covenant]], c. 806 from the oratory at Germigny-des-Prés was built by Bishop [[Theodulf of Orléans]], the probable author of the work.]]
The '''''Libri Carolini''''' ("Charles' books"), '''''Opus Caroli regis contra synodum''''' ("The work of King Charles against the Synod"), also called '''''Charlemagne's Books''''' or simply the '''''Carolines''''', are the work in four books composed on the command of [[Charlemagne]], around 790, to refute the supposed conclusions of the Byzantine [[Second Council of Nicaea]] (787), particularly as regards its acts and decrees in the matter of sacred images.  They are "much the fullest statement of the Western attitude to representational art that has been left to us by the Middle Ages".&lt;ref&gt;Dodwell, 32&lt;/ref&gt;  The work appears to have been very largely a [[polemic]] based on a misunderstanding of the actual position taken by the Byzantine church, which was quietly archived when this was realized, probably in Rome. 

The ''Libri Carolini'' were never promulgated at the time apart from being sent to [[Pope Adrian I]] who responded with a ''grandis et verbosa epistola'' (dignified and wordy letter),&lt;ref name="Gibbon"&gt;Gibbon, Edward. ''History of the Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire Vol. 5''. Kessinger Publishing. 2004. {{ISBN|1-4191-2419-6}}. p 37.&lt;/ref&gt; and remained all but unknown until they were first printed in 1549, by [[Jean du Tillet]], [[Bishop of Meaux]], under the name of ''Eriphele''.&lt;ref name="cyclo"&gt;{{1728}}&lt;/ref&gt; They contain 120 objections against the Second Council of Nicaea, and are couched in harsh, reproachful terms, including the following: ''dementiam'' ("folly"), ''priscae Gentilitatis obsoletum errorem'' ("an old and outmoded pagan misunderstanding"), ''argumenta insanissima et absurdissima'' ("most insane and absurd reasoning"), ''derisione dignas naenias'' ("screeds worthy of derision"), etc.&lt;ref name="Gibbon"/&gt; The modern edition of this text, by Ann Freeman and Paul Meyvaert (Hannover 1998), is called ''Opus Caroli regis contra synodum'' ("''The work of King Charles against the Synod''"), and is based on the manuscript in the [[Vatican Library]], which is now generally accepted as a Carolingian working manuscript "hastily finished up", when it became clear that the work was now redundant.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.jstor.org/pss/2903487 JSTOR] Review by John J. Contreni of:''Opus Caroli regis contra synodum (Libri Carolini)'' by Ann Freeman; Paul Meyvaert, ''[[Speculum (journal)|Speculum]]'', Vol. 76, No. 2 (April 2001), pp. 453-455&lt;/ref&gt;

When the work resurfaced during the [[Protestant Reformation]], it caused a good deal of excitement and confusion. Despite its support of images, [[John Calvin]] refers to it approvingly in later editions of his ''[[Institutes of the Christian Religion]]'' (Book 1, Ch 11, section 14), and uses it in his argument against the veneration of images.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vor.org/rbdisk/html/institutes/index.html Calvin's ''Institutes'']&lt;/ref&gt;

==Authorship==
The work begins, "In the name of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ beginneth the work of the most illustrious and glorious man Charles, by the will of God, king of the Franks, Gauls, Germany, Italy, neighboring provinces, with the assistance of the king, against the Synod which in Greek parts firmly and proudly decreed in favour of adoring (''adorandis'') images recklessly and arrogantly,"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=Libri Carolini, sive, Caroli Magni Capitulare de imaginibus|url=https://archive.org/stream/libricarolinisiv02bast#page/n11/mode/2up|website=archive.org|accessdate=2017-08-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; followed immediately by what is called "Charlemagne's Preface". However, it is unlikely that Charlemagne wrote any of the books himself,&lt;ref name="ECF"/&gt; although the views expressed were influenced by him.  He apparently did not accept that art had any advantages over books, a view not held by many of his advisers.

The preferred candidate as author of most modern scholars, following Anne Freeman, is Bishop [[Theodulf of Orleans]],&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=WsN-YaSICWwC&amp;pg=PA87&amp;lpg=PA87&amp;dq=%22Libri+Carolini%22&amp;source=web&amp;ots=tUHnTH7uMg&amp;sig=fEuUepuFG39OP-_PwGWPccJdFJg&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;resnum=9&amp;ct=result Dales, Richard C.]''The Intellectual Life of Western Europe in the Middle Ages'', note 3 on p. 88, BRILL, 1992
{{ISBN|90-04-09622-1}} - summarizes recent scholarship.  See also Dodwell, 32&lt;/ref&gt; a Spanish [[Visigoth]] in origin, of which traces can be detected in the Latin and the liturgical references in the work. The Vatican manuscript has an author, considered to be Theodulf, and a corrector.  It is very likely that several clerics at the court contributed to discussions formulating a work to be issued in the Emperor's name, but it seems likely that Theodulf composed the text we have.&lt;ref&gt;Dales,89&lt;/ref&gt;

In the past, some have attributed the writings to [[Angilram]], [[Bishop of Metz]] or others of the bishops of France, alleging that Pope Adrian having sent Charlemagne the Acts of the Council in 790, he gave them to the French bishops for examination, and that the ''Libri Carolini'' was the answer they returned.&lt;ref name="cyclo" /&gt; There is also evidence that the author was [[Alcuin]]; besides the English tradition that he had written such a book, there is also the remarkable similarity of his commentary on [[Gospel of John|St. John]] (4, 5, et seqq.) to a passage in ''Liber IV.'', cap. vi., of the ''Libri Carolini''.&lt;ref name="ECF"/&gt;

==Contents==
According to the ''Libri Carolini'', images may be used as ecclesiastical ornaments, for purposes of instruction, and in memory of past events. It is foolish, however, to burn incense before them and to use lights, though it is quite wrong to cast them out of the churches and destroy them. Strong opposition is voiced to "adoration" of images, wrongly believing that the [[Second Council of Nicaea]] used this word, taken to mean the absolute adoration reserved for God alone, while only appropriate veneration is to be given to the saints and reverential honour to the Cross of Christ, Scripture, sacred vessels, and relics of the saints. The Greek word προσκύνησις that the Council in fact used means no more than reverence in a prostrate attitude.&lt;ref name=CE&gt;[http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/03371b.htm Thomas Shahan, "Caroline Books (Libri Carolini)" in ''Catholic Encyclopedia'' (New York 1908)]&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''Libri Carolini'' also blame the excessive reverence shown by the Greeks to their emperors, criticize unfavourably the elevation of [[Patriarch Tarasios of Constantinople|Tarasius]] to the Patriarchate of Constantinople, and find fault with the Scriptural and patristic exegesis of the Greeks. They confuse statements of the Second Council of Nicaea with those of the Iconoclastic conciliabulum of 754, frequently misrepresent the facts, and in general exhibit a strong anti-Greek bias.&lt;ref name=CE/&gt;

Various iconodule arguments for the use of images are dismissed. The reverence shown to the [[Ark of the Covenant]] in the [[Hebrew Bible]] is not accepted as an analogy for the attitude due to art, as the Ark was made on the direct instructions and to the designs of God himself.  That Theodulf's oratory has a mosaic on this very subject, otherwise unknown at this scale, is itself taken as an argument for his authorship of the work.&lt;ref&gt;Dodwell, 49&lt;/ref&gt;

The contents were interpreted by [[John Calvin|Calvin]] and other [[iconoclasm|iconoclast]] writers during the [[Protestant Reformation]] as support for their attitude. They were also put on the [[Index Librorum Prohibitorum]], where they remained until 1900, either because of their iconoclastic arguments or because seen as interference by a civil authority in matters of Church doctrine.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=7rjenNXferEC&amp;pg=PA90&amp;dq=%22Libri+Carolini%22+Index&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=MolGUtyLGoLwhQfsxIBA&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Libri%20Carolini%22%20Index&amp;f=false Paul Oskar Kristeller et al.

==Authority==
According to the [[Catholic Encyclopedia]] the editions of the ''Libri Carolini'' that have been in print are not those that were sent to Pope Adrian by Charlemagne, to which the Pope designed to write a refutation. This has been shown by [[Karl Josef von Hefele|Hefele]], who notes that those sent to the Pope treated the matter in an entirely different order; and that they contained only 85 chapters,&lt;ref name=CE/&gt; while the printed books have 120, or 121 if the authenticity of the last chapter is granted. Moreover, the quotations made in Adrian's reply do not occur verbatim in the ''Libri Carolini'', but are in some cases lengthened, in others abbreviated.&lt;ref name="ECF"&gt;"[http://www.ccel.org/fathers2/NPNF2-14/Npnf2-14-171.htm Examination of the Caroline Books]". ''Early Church Fathers: Nicene and Post-Nicene Fathers, Series II, Vol. XIV''. Public domain.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Petavius]] thinks that what Adrian received were extracts from the ''Libri Carolini'', made by the [[Council of Frankfort]] (794). Hefele arrives at a directly opposite conclusion, ''viz.'', that the ''Libri Carolini'' are an expansion of the Capitula sent to the Pope, and that this expansion was made at the bidding of Charlemagne. [[Baronius]], [[Robert Bellarmine|Bellarmine]], [[Severin Binius|Binius]], and [[Surius]] all questioned the authenticity of the ''Libri Carolini'' altogether. However, this extreme position seems to be refuted by the fact that certain quotations made by [[Hincmar]] are found in the modern printed books,&lt;ref name="ECF"/&gt; and may have been influenced by their use by Protestant writers during the Reformation.  It is now generally accepted that the books are authentic, and the original Carolingian manuscript, as published by Freeman, was rediscovered in the 20th century.

==All a misunderstanding==
The work was refuting a bad copy of a very incompetent translation of the Byzantine decrees. In particular it seems clear that at least one negative was omitted, reversing the sense of the Greek, and that the Greek word [[proskynesis]] was mistranslated as "[[adoration]]", for which the Greek word is ''[[latria]]'', which the Council had stated, in the invariable position shared by Catholics and Orthodox, was due only to the persons of the [[Trinity]].&lt;ref&gt;Gale, 87&lt;/ref&gt;

(1728 Cyclopedia)
It seems that the authors of these books had never read the acts nor decrees of the [[Second Council of Nicaea]], or only in a very poor translation. Further, they seemed ignorant of what took place at the [[Second Council of Constantinople]] in 754. As an example, in Book IV., Chapter xiv., and also in Chapter xx., (Migne's ed., col. 1213 and col. 1226), the charge is made that the [[Second Council of Nicaea]], specifically Gregory, the [[bishop of Neocaesarea]], unduly flattered the Empress. However, these remarks were made at the [[Conciliabulum]] of 754, and not at the Second Council of Nicaea; also, they were not made by Gregory of Neocaesarea at all, and the reason they are attributed to him is because he read them in the proceedings of that pseudo-council to the true council of 787.&lt;ref name="ECF"/&gt;

The most famous example of incongruity in these books occurs in Book III., Chapter xvii., in which it is attributed to [[Constantius of Cyprus|Constantius]], the bishop of [[Cyprus]], the statement that the sacred images were to be given supreme adoration due to the Holy Trinity. Sir [[William Palmer (theologian)|William Palmer]], and most modern scholars, attribute all of these mistakes to the books' authors using a mistranslated version of the acts and decrees of the Second Council of Nicaea. Of this translation, Anastasius Bibliothetius says, "The translator both misunderstood the genius of the Greek language as well as that of the Latin, and has merely translated word for word; and in such a fashion that it is scarcely ever possible to know (aut vix aut nunquam) what it means; moreover nobody ever reads this translation and no copies of it are made."&lt;ref name="ECF"/&gt;

Following are select false statements made in the text:

*In the Preface, it states that the [[Second Council of Constantinople|Conciliabulum]] was "held in [[Bithynia]];" however, they were held in Constantinople.
*In Book I, chapter i. are quoted certain words said to occur in the letters of the Empress and her son. On this Hefele remarks: "One cannot find the words in either of the two letters of these sovereigns, which are preserved in the acts of the Council of Nicaea."
*In the Second Book, chapter xxvii., the council is charged with saying, "Just as the Lord's body and blood pass over from fruits of the earth to a notable mystery, so also the images, made by the skill of the artificers, pass over to the veneration of those persons whose images they bear." Now this was never said nor taught by the Nicene Synod, but something like it was taught by the Constantinopolitan conciliabulum of 754. These exact words cited occur neither in the one set of acts nor in the other. The underlying thought, however, was clearly exposed by the iconoclastic synod of 754 and as clearly refuted by the orthodox synod of 787.
*In Book III, chapter v., it states that, "[[Patriarch Tarasios of Constantinople|Tarasius]] said in his confession of faith that the Holy Spirit was the companion (''contribulum'' in the ''Libri Carolini'') of the Father and of the Son." It was not Tarasius who said this, but Theodore of Jerusalem.
*Chapter XVII. begins thus: "How rashly and (so to speak) like a fool, Constantine, bishop of Constantia in Cyprus, spoke when he said, with the approval of the rest of the bishops, that he would receive and honourably embrace the images; and babbled that the service of adoration which is due to the consubstantial and life-giving Trinity, should be given images, we need not here discuss, since to all who either read or hear this it will be clear that he was swamped in no small error, to wit to confess that he exhibited to creatures the service due to the Creator alone, and through his desire to favour the pictures overturned all the Holy Scriptures. For what sane man ever either said or thought of saying such an absurdity, as that different pictures should be held in the same honour as the holy, victorious Trinity. the creator of all things, etc." But according to the acts, this is exactly the opposite of what Constantine did say.&lt;ref name="ECF"/&gt;

This article is a '''list of the [[palette (computing)|color palette]]s''' for notable [[computer graphics]], [[Computer terminal|terminals]] and [[video game console]] hardware.

Only a sample and the palette's name are given here. More specific articles are linked from the name of each palette, for the test charts, samples, simulated images, and further technical details (including references).

In the past, manufacturers have developed many different display systems in a competitive, non-collaborative basis (with a few exceptions, as the [[VESA]] consortium), creating many proprietary, non-standard different instances of display [[computer hardware|hardware]]. Often, as with early [[personal computer|personal]] and [[home computer]]s, a given machine employed its unique display subsystem, with its also unique color palette. Also, [[Computer software|software]] developers had made use of the color abilities of distinct display systems in many different ways. The result is that there is no single common standard nomenclature or classification taxonomy which can encompass every computer color palette.

In order to organize the material, color palettes have been grouped following arbitrary but rational criteria. First, generic monochrome and full [[RGB]] repertories common to various computer display systems. Second, usual color repertories used for display systems that employ [[indexed color]] techniques. And finally, specific manufacturers' color palettes implemented in many representative early [[personal computer]]s and [[video game console|videogame console]]s of various brands.

The list for personal computer palettes is split into two categories: [[8-bit]] and [[16-bit]] machines. This is not intended as a true strict categorization of such machines, because mixed architectures also exist (16-bit [[Central processing unit|processor]]s with an 8-bit [[Bus (computing)|data bus]] or 32-bit processors with a 16-bit data bus, among others). The distinction is based more on broad 8-bit and 16-bit computer ''ages'' or ''generations'' (around 1975&amp;ndash;1985 and 1985&amp;ndash;1995, respectively) and their associated [[state of the art]] in color display capabilities.

Here is the common color test chart and sample image used to render every palette in this series of articles:

==List of monochrome and RGB palettes==

{{main|List of monochrome and RGB palettes}}

For the purpose of this article, the term ''monochrome palette'' means a set of intensities for a monochrome display, and the term ''RGB palette'' is defined as the complete set of combinations a given [[RGB]] display can offer by mixing all the possible intensities of the red, green, and blue primaries available in its hardware.

These are generic complete repertories of colors to produce black and white and RGB color pictures by the display hardware, not necessarily the total number of such colors that can be simultaneously displayed in a given text or graphic mode of any machine. RGB is the most common method to produce colors for displays; so these complete RGB color repertories have every possible combination of R-G-B triplets within any given maximum number of levels per component.

For specific hardware and different methods to produce colors than [[RGB]], see the [[List of palettes#List of computer hardware palettes|List of computer hardware palettes]] and the [[List of palettes#List of computer hardware palettes|List of videogame consoles]] sections.

For various software arrangements and sorts of colors, including other possible full RGB arrangements within 8-bit [[color depth|depth]] displays, see the [[List of palettes#List of software palettes|List of software palettes]] section.

===Regular RGB palettes===

:These full RGB palettes employ the same number of [[bit]]s to store the relative intensity for the red, green and blue components of every image's [[pixel]] color. Thus, they have the same number of levels per channel and the total number of possible colors is always the cube of a power of two. It should be understood ''that 'when developed' ''many of these formats were directly related to the size of some host computers 'natural word length' in bytes&amp;mdash;the amount of memory in bits held by a single memory address such that the CPU can grab or put it in one operation.

===Non-regular RGB palettes===

:These are also RGB palettes, in the sense defined above (except for the 4-bit RGBI, which has an intensity bit that affects all channels at once), but either they do not have the same number of levels for each primary channel, or the numbers are not powers of two, so are not represented as separate bit fields.  All of these have been used in popular [[personal computer]]s.

==List of software palettes==

{{main|List of software palettes}}

Systems that use a 4-bit or 8-bit pixel [[Color depth|depth]] can display up to 16 or 256 colors simultaneously. Many [[personal computer]]s in the later 1980s and early 1990s displayed at most 256 different colors, freely selected by [[software]] (either by the user or by a program) from their wider hardware's color palette.

Usual selections of colors in limited subsets (generally 16 or 256) of the full palette includes some RGB level arrangements commonly used with the 8 bpp palettes as ''master palettes'' or ''universal palettes'' (i.e., palettes for multipurpose uses).

These are some representative software palettes, but any selection can be made in such types of systems.

===System specific palettes===

:These are selections of colors officially employed as system palettes in some popular [[operating system]]s for [[personal computer]]s that feature 8-bit displays.

==List of computer hardware palettes==

In early [[personal computer]]s and [[Computer terminal|terminals]] that offered color displays, some color palettes were chosen algorithmically to provide the most diverse set of colors for a given palette size, and others were chosen to assure the availability of certain colors.  In many early home computers, especially when the palette choices were determined at the hardware level by [[resistor]] combinations, the palette was determined by the manufacturer.

Many early models output [[composite video]] [[YPbPr]] colors. When seen on TV devices, the perception of the colors may not correspond with the value levels for the YPbPr values employed (most noticeable with NTSC TV color system).

For current RGB display systems for [[Personal computer|PC]]'s ([[Super VGA]], etc.), see the [[List of monochrome and RGB palettes#16-bit RGB|16-bit RGB]] and [[List of monochrome and RGB palettes#24-bit RGB|24-bit RGB]] for [[HighColor]] (''thousands'') and [[TrueColor]] (''millions of colors'') modes.

For [[video game console]]s, see the [[List of color palettes#Video game console palettes|List of videogame consoles]] section.

For every model, their main different graphical color modes are listed based exclusively in the way they handle colors on screen, not all their different screen modes.

The list is ordered roughly historically by video hardware, not grouped by branch. They are listed according to the original model of every system, which implies that enhanced versions, clones and compatibles also support the original palette.

In [[broadcasting]], '''local insertion''' (known in the [[United Kingdom]] as an '''opt-out''') is the act or capability of a broadcast [[television station]], [[radio station]] or [[cable television|cable]] system to insert or replace part of a [[broadcast network|network]] feed with [[content (media and publishing)|content]] unique to the local station or system. Most often this is a [[station identification]] (required by the [[broadcasting authority]] such as the U.S. [[Federal Communications Commission]]), but is also commonly used for [[television commercial|television]] or [[radio ad]]vertisements, or a weather or [[traffic report]]. A [[digital on-screen graphic]] ("dog" or "bug"), commonly a translucent [[watermark]], may also be [[keying (graphics)|keyed]] (superimposed) with a television station ID over the network feed using a [[character generator]] using [[genlock]]. In cases where individual broadcast stations carry programs separate from those shown on the main network, this is known as [[regional variation]] (in the [[United Kingdom]]) or an opt-out (in [[Canada]] and the [[United States]]).

Automated local insertion used to be triggered with [[in-band signaling]], such as [[DTMF]] tones or [[infrasound|sub-audible sounds]] (such as 25 [[Hertz|Hz]]), but is now done with [[out-of-band signaling]], such as [[analog signal]] [[subcarrier]]s via [[communications satellite]], or now more commonly via [[Digital signal (electronics)|digital signal]]s; [[broadcast automation]] equipment can then handle these automatically.{{Citation needed|date=November 2008}} In an emergency, such as [[severe weather]], local insertion may also occur instantly through command from another network or other source (such as the [[Emergency Alert System]] or [[First Warning]]). In this case, the most urgent warning messages may interrupt without delay, while others may be worked into a normal break in programming within 15 minutes of their initial issuance.{{Citation needed|date=November 2008}}

==Within individual programs==
In the [[United States]], insertion can easily be heard every evening on the nationally [[broadcast syndication#Radio syndication|syndicated]] radio show ''[[Delilah Rene|Delilah]]'', where the host does a pre-recorded station-specific [[voiceover]] played over a [[music bed]] from the network. When host Delilah Rene says "this is Delilah", her voice (often in a slightly different tone or mood than what she has just been speaking) then identifies the [[moniker|branding]] or identification for the specific station (for example, "on B98.5 FM" when heard on [[WSB-FM]] in [[Atlanta]], [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]]). Because of this slight difference in vocal quality, many syndicated radio networks suggest using only one voice for local station IDs 24/7; this way, the difference in vocal intonation is lessened. Insertion is made conspicuous when, due to carelessness, or even abuse—e.g. to squeeze in one more ad—the network program is already underway by the time the insert closes.

The other more prominent example is during [[Broadcasting of sports events|live sports programming]] carried over radio and television networks, where close to the top of the hour, a [[play-by-play announcer]] will say "we pause ten seconds for station identification; this is the (team name) (radio network branding)", or a close equivalent. On most stations, this is a basic [[station identification]], as required by the [[Federal Communications Commission]] (FCC), with the call letters and [[city of license]] relayed, while on others a quickly-read five second advertisement or program promotion is read before the identification, or a [[breaking news]] event or weather warning occurring during the event is relayed, followed by the station ID. Due to many sports rights deals for televised sports moving to [[regional sports network]]s which are not required to identify themselves under FCC guidelines, or network sports coverage where the station is identified through an on-screen display by the local station rather than speech, this is more prominent on radio rather than television.

Local commercial (and some non-commercial) broadcast television stations also insert local commercial breaks during programming each half-hour while network-supplied or syndicated content is being broadcast. Television networks and syndication distributors give their [[network affiliate|affiliate]]s either 60, 90 or 120 seconds each half-hour (typically totaling about four minutes per hour) to run local station breaks, including [[promo (media)|promos]] for the station and advertisements for national and local area businesses (and on a few stations, local news updates – which were particularly common during the 1970s through the 1990s, especially as the "24 Hour News Source" format became commonplace in the United States during the latter decade – current time and temperature information, or a brief local weather forecast), over network programming. Typically, these networks air a blank feed showing the network's logo (such as with [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]], [[NBC]] and [[The CW]]) or a series of [[public service announcements]] (as with [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] and CBS), while stations air local commercials. [[PBS]] member stations and other [[non-commercial educational]] stations also insert promos for network series and/or syndicated or locally produced programming during promo breaks; as these station are non-commercial, breaks are typically not featured during the programs themselves, instead promos are inserted in-between shows, even – in the case of PBS members – if the station is carrying the national network feed.

Various [[Breakfast television|television morning news shows]] (such as ''[[Good Morning America]]'' and ''[[Today (U.S. TV program)|Today]]'') also allocate five minutes of programming time each half-hour for stations to carry a local news update (which sometimes run as little as three minutes) at :25 and :55 minutes past the hour; however the national feed continues for stations that do not wish to "break away", either because they do not air a morning newscast or simply do not have a news department (for example, some mid-sized and smaller market NBC affiliates, such as [[KTEN]] in [[Ada, Oklahoma]], do not air news cut-ins during the weekend edition of ''Today'' if they do not have a weekend morning newscast, but cut-ins are shown during the weekday telecasts where ''Today'' follows a morning newscast). This also occurs with news on [[NPR]]'s ''[[Morning Edition]]'' and ''[[All Things Considered]]'', which respectively air during the morning and evening rush hours.

Starting in the early 1990s, some cable television systems began carrying a local insert called "[[Local Edition]]", a segment featuring local news inserts (which are produced by area television stations or local cable operators) that air at :24 and :54 minutes past the hour during [[HLN (TV channel)|HLN]]'s rolling daytime news block, usually during the network's non-essential features news block. This has been discontinued as that network has switched to a general news/talk format beginning in 2005.

==Transmitter identification==
[[Broadcast translator|Translator stations]] may also have local insertion, though this is generally limited to identifying the repeating station's [[callsign]] and [[city of license|community of license]] separate from its parent station. In the United States, the FCC also allows up to 30 seconds each hour for fundraising to keep the translator service on the air.

==Pay television==
Local insertion is also used by cable and [[telephone company]] television providers, in which cable and telco [[cable headend|headends]] insert advertisements for the system, promotions for programs on other cable channels carried by the provider and commercials for local area businesses (such as car dealerships or furniture stores) at least twice each hour; unlike most commercial broadcast stations, however, cable channels often run only 60 seconds of local commercial inserts each half-hour near the end of the first or second commercial break and are aired in place of national ads or network promos that air during that given time. [[Direct-broadcast satellite]] services cannot locally insert content during commercial breaks, so viewers are either able to see ads or promos that are covered up by the local content on cable or see a DBS provider's own promotions.

Local insertion on cable television is used especially on [[The Weather Channel]] in the U.S. and [[The Weather Network]]/[[MétéoMédia]] in Canada, where systems like the [[WeatherStar]], [[IntelliStar]] and [[PMX (technology)|PMX]] have been used to show regularly scheduled local [[weather forecast]]s (known as "[[Local on the 8s]]" on The Weather Channel in the U.S.), and well as the lower display line (LDL) or [[lower third|lower-third]] graphic that is shown at other times. The Weather Channel, in particular also airs ads during national breaks at the end of some advertisements allowing its WeatherSTAR or IntelliSTAR systems to insert selected locations for certain businesses operating in the area, such as restaurants or auto rental dealers; though The Weather Channel has not done this as much in recent years as they have in the past. This only applies to the cable systems, although in the U.S. direct-broadcast satellite services have shown an LDL of the current conditions and 12-hour forecast for select major cities. This is not seen on older [[Television receive-only|TVRO]] or "[[big ugly dish]]" systems, as this is intended as a [[backhaul (telecom)|backhaul]] and has very few [[end-user]]s, and is used as a [[clean feed (TV)|clean feed]].

===Set-top boxes===
In place of the IntelliSTAR, a hyperlocal form of insertion is now done on [[DirecTV]] (and possibly other DBS services), whereby the first half of the local forecast is generated by the [[set-top box]]. A "cutout" at the upper right corner of the picture allows the sponsor's advertising logo to be shown live from the main video feed, while a [[datacast]] on the satellite (like that which provides the [[electronic program guide]]) sends simple forecast and conditions data for the entire country every couple of minutes. Graphics are stored on the receiver, and displayed according to the forecast, which is selected by [[ZIP code]] or city according to user settings.

Additionally, starting in 2011, DirecTV users with [[digital video recorder]]s will have commercials [[download]]ed to their boxes, which will play according to their [[demographic]] information,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=DirecTV Will Launch First Targeted TV Commercials|url=http://www.newsamen.com/101807/directv-will-launch-first-targeted-tv-commercials|work=NewsAmen.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; likely commanding higher [[revenue]] from [[advertiser]]s. This may eventually lead to or merge with [[interactive television]], which may find more success on cable and telco television because of the lack of a [[return channel]] on satellite and broadcast. [[Internet-connected TV]]s may erode this barrier as well, however, with only their embedded [[flash memory]] chip necessary to hold short video clips.

A '''''{{transl|ar|ALA|madhhab}}''''' ({{lang-ar|مذهب}} ''{{transl|ar|DIN|maḏhab}}'', {{IPA-ar|ˈmaðhab|IPA}}, "way to act"; pl. {{lang|ar|مذاهب}} ''{{transl|ar|DIN|maḏāhib}}'', {{IPA-ar|maˈðaːhɪb|}}) is a school of thought within ''[[fiqh]]'' (Islamic [[jurisprudence]]). In the first 150 years of [[Islam]], there were numerous ''madhahib'', most of which have become extinct or merged with other schools. The [[Amman Message]], which was endorsed in 2005 by prominent Islamic scholars around the world, recognized four [[Sunni Islam|Sunni]] schools ([[Hanafi]], [[Maliki]], [[Shafi'i]], [[Hanbali]]), two [[Shia Islam|Shia]] schools ([[Ja'fari jurisprudence|Ja'fari]], [[Zaidiyyah|Zaidi]]), the [[Ibadi]] school and the [[Zahiri]] school.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Amman Message|url=http://ammanmessage.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=15&amp;Itemid=29&amp;limit=1&amp;limitstart=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==="Ancient" schools===
According to John Burton, “modern research shows” that fiqh was first “regionally organized” with “considerable disagreement and variety of view”. In the second century of Islam, schools of fiqh were noted for the loyalty of their jurists  to the legal practices of their local communities, whether [[Mecca]], [[Kufa]], [[Basra]], Syria, etc.&lt;ref name=JBSILITA1990:13&gt;[[#JBSILITA1990|Burton, ''Islamic Theories of Abrogation'', 1990]]: p.13&lt;/ref&gt; (Egypt's school in [[Fustat]] was a branch of Medina's school of law and followed such practices -- up until the end of the 8th century -- as basing verdict on one single witness (not two) and the oath of the claimant. Its principal jurist in the second half of the 8th century was al-Layth b. Sa'd.){{#tag:ref|
It is usually assumed that no regional school developed in Egypt (unlike in Syria, Iraq and the Hijaz). Joseph Schacht states that the legal milieu of [[Fustat]] (ancient Cairo) was a branch of the Medinan school of law.&lt;ref&gt;J. Schacht, ''The Origins of Muhammadan Jurisprudence'' (Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1950), p. 9&lt;/ref&gt; Regarding judicial practices, the qadis (judges) of Fustat resorted to the procedure called "''al-yamin ma'a l-shahid''", that is, the ability of the judge to base his verdict on one single witness and the oath of the claimant, instead of two witnesses as was usually required. Such a procedure was quite common under the early Umayyads, but by the early Abbasid period it had disappeared in Iraq and it was now regarded as the {{'}}''amal'' ("good practice") of Medina. Up until the end of the 8th century, the qadis of Fustat were still using this "Medinan" procedure and differentiated themselves from Iraqi practices. From a doctrinal point of view, however, the legal affiliation of Egypt could be more complex. The principal Egyptian jurist in the second half of the 8th century is al-Layth b. Sa'd.&lt;ref&gt;R.G. Khoury, "Al-Layth Ibn Sa'd (94/713-175/791), grand maître et mécène de l’Egypte, vu à travers quelques documents islamiques anciens", ''Journal of Near Eastern Studies'' 40, 1981, p. 189–202&lt;/ref&gt; The only writing of his that has survived is a letter he wrote to Malik b. Anas, which has been preserved by Yahya b. Ma'in and al-Fasawi. In this letter, he proclaims his theoretical affiliation to the Medinan methodology and recognizes the value of the {{'}}''amal''. Nevertheless, he distances himself from the Medinan School by opposing a series of Medinan legal views. He maintains that the common practice in other cities is also valuable, and thus implicitly defends the Egyptians’ adherence to their own local tradition. Thus it is possible that, even though it did not develop into a formal school of law, a specific Egyptian legal milieu was distinct of the Medinan School in the 8th century.&lt;ref&gt;Mathieu Tillier, "[https://www.academia.edu/1470575/Les_premiers_cadis_de_Fus_a_et_les_dynamiques_regionales_de_linnovation_judiciaire_750-833_ Les “premiers” cadis de Fusṭāṭ et les dynamiques régionales de l’innovation judiciaire (750-833)]", ''Annales Islamologiques'', 45 (2011), p. 214–218&lt;/ref&gt;|group=Note}} 
[[Al-Shafi‘i]] writes that, `every capital of the Muslims is a seat of learning whose people follow the opinion of one of their countrymen in most of his teachings`.&lt;ref name=Schacht-OoMJ-1959-246&gt;{{cite book |title=The Origins of Muhammadan Jurisprudence |last1=Schacht |first=Joseph |publisher=Oxford University Press |origyear= 1950 |year= 1959 |page=246 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=tr-III-148&gt;{{cite book |last1=Shafi'i |page=148. Kitab Ikhtilaf Malid wal-Shafi'i | title=Kitab al-Umm vol. vii}}&lt;/ref&gt; The "real basis" of legal doctrine in these "ancient schools" was not a body of reports of Muhammad's sayings, doings, silent approval (the ahadith) or even those of his Companions, but the `living tradition` of the school as "expressed in the consensus of the scholars", according to Joseph Schacht.&lt;ref name=Schacht-OoMJ-1959-98&gt;{{cite book |title=The Origins of Muhammadan Jurisprudence |last1=Schacht |first=Joseph |publisher=Oxford University Press |origyear= 1950 |year= 1959 |page=98 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Al-Shafi‘i and after===
It has been asserted that ''madhahib'' were consolidated in the 9th and 10th centuries as a means of excluding dogmatic theologians, government officials and non-Sunni sects from religious discourse.&lt;ref name="stewart"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.encyclopedia.com/topic/Islamic_law.aspx |title=Law, Islamic |work=[[Encyclopedia.com]] |accessdate=13 March 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Historians have differed regarding the times at which the various schools emerged.  One interpretation is that Sunni Islam was initially{{when|date=December 2013}} split into four groups: the [[Hanafi]]tes, [[Maliki]]tes, [[Shafi'i]]tes and [[Zahiri]]tes.&lt;ref&gt;Mohammad Sharif Khan and Mohammad Anwar Saleem, ''Muslim Philosophy And Philosophers'', pg. 34. [[New Delhi]]: Ashish Publishing House, 1994.&lt;/ref&gt; Later, the [[Hanbali]]tes and [[Jariri]]tes developed two more schools; then various dynasties effected the eventual exclusion of the Jarirites;&lt;ref name=mel&gt;[[Christopher Melchert]], ''The Formation of the Sunni Schools of Law'': 9th-10th Centuries C.E., pg. 178. Leiden: Brill Publishers, 1997.&lt;/ref&gt; eventually, the Zahirites were also excluded when the [[Mamluk Sultanate (Cairo)|Mamluk Sultanate]] established a total of four independent [[Qadi|judicial positions]], thus solidifying the Maliki, Hanafi, Shafi'i and Hanbali schools.&lt;ref name="stewart" /&gt;  The Ottoman Empire later reaffirmed the official status of these four schools as a reaction to Shi'ite Persia.&lt;ref name=chib&gt;Chibli Mallat, ''Introduction to Middle Eastern Law'', pg. 116. [[Oxford]]: [[Oxford University Press]], 2007. {{ISBN|978-0-19-923049-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Some are of the view that Sunni jurisprudence falls into two groups: ''Ahl al-Ra'i'' ("people of opinions", emphasizing scholarly judgment and reason) and ''[[Ahl al-Hadith]]'' ("people of traditions", emphasizing strict interpretation of scripture).&lt;ref&gt;Murtada Mutahhari, [http://www.al-islam.org/al-tawhid/ijtihad-legislation.htm ''The Role of Ijtihad in Legislation''], [http://www.al-islam.org/al-tawhid/ Al-Tawhid] volume IV, No.2, Publisher: [http://www.itf.org.ir/ Islamic Thought Foundation]&lt;/ref&gt;

10th century [[Shia Islam|Shi'ite]] scholar [[Ibn al-Nadim]] named eight groups: Maliki, Hanafi, Shafi'i, Zahiri, [[Twelver|Imami Shi'ite]], Ahl al-Hadith, Jariri and [[Kharijites|Kharijite]].&lt;ref name=mel /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Devin J.

Historically, the ''fiqh'' schools were often in political and academic conflict with one another, vying for favor with the ruling government in order to have their representatives appointed to legislative and especially judiciary positions.&lt;ref name=chib /&gt;  Geographer and historian [[Al-Muqaddasi]] once satirically categorized competing ''madhahib'' with contrasting personal qualities: Hanafites, highly conscious of being hired for official positions, appeared deft, well-informed, devout and prudent; Malikites, dull and obtuse, confined themselves to observance of prophetic tradition; Shafi'ites were shrewd, impatient, understanding and quick-tempered; Zahirites haughty, irritable, loquacious and well-to-do; Shi'ites, entrenched and intractable in old rancor, enjoyed riches and fame; and Hanbalites, anxious to practice what they preached, were charitable and inspiring.&lt;ref&gt;[[Louis Massignon]], ''The Passion of al-Hallaj: Mystic and Martyr of Islam''. Trans. Herbert W. Mason. Pg. 130. [[Princeton, New Jersey|Princeton]]: [[Princeton University Press]], 1994.&lt;/ref&gt; While such descriptions were almost assuredly humorous in nature, ancient differences were less to do with actual doctrinal opinions than with maneuvering for adherents and influence.{{citation needed|date=December 2013}}

== List of schools ==
Generally, Sunnis have a single preferred ''madhhab'' from region to region, but also believe that ''[[ijtihad]]'' must be exercised by the contemporary scholars capable of doing so.  Most rely on ''[[taqlid]]'', or acceptance of religious rulings and epistemology from a higher religious authority in deferring meanings of analysis and derivation of legal practices instead of relying on subjective readings.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sahihmuslim.com/sps/sp.cfm?subsecID=MNJ06&amp;articleID=MNJ060001&amp;articlePages=1]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rissc.jo/docs/1N-WithCovers(lowres).pdf On Islam, Muslims and the 500 most influential figures]&lt;/ref&gt;

Experts and scholars of ''fiqh'' follow the ''[[usul al-fiqh|usul]]'' (principles) of their own native ''madhhab'', but they also study the ''usul'', evidences, and opinions of other ''madhahib''.

===Sunni===
{{Sunni Islam|Sunni Schools of Law}}

[[Sunni]] schools of jurisprudence are each named after the classical jurist who taught them.  The four primary Sunni schools are the [[Hanafi]], [[Shafi'i]], [[Maliki]] and [[Hanbali]] rites. The [[Zahiri]] school remains in existence but outside of the mainstream, while the [[Jariri]], [[Laythi]], [[Awza'i]] and [[Thawri]] have  become extinct.

The extant schools share most of their rulings, but differ on the particular practices which they may accept as authentic and the varying weights they give to [[Qiyas|analogical]] reason and pure reason.

* The [[Hanafi]] school was founded by [[Abu Hanifa an-Nu‘man]]. It is followed by Muslims in the Levant, Central Asia, Afghanistan, Pakistan, India, Bangladesh, most of Egypt, Iraq, Turkey, the Balkans and by most of [[Islam in Russia|Russia's Muslim community]]. There are movements within this school such as [[Barelvi]]s and [[Deobandi]], which are concentrated in South Asia.
* The [[Maliki]] school was founded by [[Malik ibn Anas]]. It is followed by Muslims in North Africa, West Africa, the United Arab Emirates, Kuwait, in parts of Saudi Arabia and in Upper Egypt. The [[Murabitun World Movement]] follows this school as well. In the past, it was also followed in parts of [[Islam in Europe|Europe under Islamic rule]], particularly [[Al-Andalus|Islamic Spain]] and the [[Emirate of Sicily]].
* The [[Shafi'i]] school was founded by [[Muhammad ibn Idris ash-Shafi'i]]. It is followed by Muslims in Saudi Arabia, Eastern Lower Egypt, Indonesia, Malaysia, Jordan, Palestine, the Philippines, Singapore, Somalia, Thailand, Yemen, Kurdistan, and the [[Mappila]]s of [[Kerala]] and [[Konkani Muslims]] of India. It is the official school followed by the governments of Brunei and Malaysia.
* The [[Hanbali]] school was founded by [[Ahmad ibn Hanbal]]. It is followed by Muslims in Qatar, most of Saudi Arabia and minority communities in Syria and Iraq. The majority of the [[Salafi]]st movement claims to follow this school.
* The [[Zahiri]] school was founded by [[Dawud al-Zahiri]]. It is followed by minority communities in Morocco and Pakistan. In the past, it was also followed by the majority of Muslims in Mesopotamia, Portugal, the Balearic Islands, North Africa and parts of Spain.

===Shia===
{{Shia Islam|collapsed=1}}
{{Twelvers|collapsed=1}}

* [[Twelver]]s (see also ''[[Imami]]'')
** [[Ja'fari]]: associated with [[Ja'far al-Sadiq]].  The time and space bound [[Fatwa|rulings]] of early jurists are taken more seriously in this school, likely due to the more hierarchical structure of Shia Islam which is ruled by the Shi'ite [[Imam (Shia Islam)|Imams]].  The Ja'fari school is also more flexible in that every jurist has considerable power to alter a decision according to his reasoning. The Jafari school uses the [['aql|intellect]] instead of analogy when establishing Islamic laws, as opposed to common Sunni practice.
*** [[Usulism]]: forms the overwhelming majority within the Twelver Shia denomination. They follow a [[Marja'|Marja-i Taqlid]] on the subject of [[taqlid]] and fiqh. They are concentrated in &lt;nowiki&gt;Iran, Pakistan, Azerbaijan, India, Iraq, and Lebanon&lt;/nowiki&gt;.
*** [[Akhbarism]]: similar to Usulis, however reject [[ijtihad]] in favor of hadith. Concentrated in Bahrain.
*** [[Shaykhism]]: an Islamic religious movement founded by [[Shaykh Ahmad]] in the early 19th century [[Qajar dynasty]], Iran, now retaining a minority following in Iran and Iraq. It began from a combination of Sufi and Shia and Akhbari doctrines. In the mid 19th-century many Shaykhis converted to the [[Bábism|Bábí]] and [[Bahá'í Faith|Bahá'í]] religions, which regard Shaykh Ahmad highly.
** The [[Batiniyyah]] school consists of [[Alevis]], [[Bektashi Order|Bektashis]], and [[Alawites]], who developed their own fiqh system and do not pursue the [[Ja'fari jurisprudence]].
*** [[Alawism]] is followed by [[Alawites]], who are also called Nusayris, Nusairis, Namiriya or Ansariyya. Their [[madh'hab]] was established by [[Ibn Nusayr]], and their [[aqidah]] is developed by [[Al-Khaṣībī]]. They follow ''Cillī'' [[aqidah]] of ''"Maymūn ibn [[Al-Tabarani|Abu’l-Qāsim Sulaiman ibn Ahmad ibn at-Tabarānī]] fiqh"'' of the [[‘Alawi]]s.&lt;ref name="Meymûn"&gt;"Muhammad ibn Āliyy’ūl Cillī [[aqidah]]" of "Maymūn ibn [[Al-Tabarani|Abu’l-Qāsim Sulaiman ibn Ahmad ibn at-Tabarānī]] fiqh" (Sūlaiman Affandy, ''Al-Bākūrat’ūs Sūlaiman’īyyah - [[Family tree]] of the [[Nusayri]] [[Tariqat]],'' pp. 14-15, [[Beirut]], 1873.)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Both ''Muhammad ibn Āliyy’ūl Cillī'' and ''Maymūn ibn [[Al-Tabarani|Abu’l-Qāsim’at-Tabarānī]]'' were the [[murid]]s of ''"[[Al-Khaṣībī]]"'', the founder of the [[Nusayri]] [[tariqat]].&lt;/ref&gt; Slightly over one million of them live in Syria and Lebanon.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/intro/islam-alawi.htm|title=Alawi Islam|author=John Pike|publisher=|accessdate=15 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*** [[Alevism]], sometimes categorized as part of Twelver Shia Islam and sometimes as its own religious tradition, as it has markedly different philosophy, customs, and rituals. They have many ''[[Tasawwuf]]ī'' characteristics and express belief in the [[Qur'an]] and [[The Twelve Imams]], but reject [[polygamy]] and accept religious traditions predating Islam, like Turkish [[shamanism]]. They are significant in East-Central Turkey. They are sometimes considered a Sufi sect, and have an untraditional form of religious leadership that is not scholarship oriented like other Sunni and Shia groups. They number around 24 million worldwide, of which 17 million are in [[Turkey]], with the rest in the [[Balkans]], [[Albania]], [[Azerbaijan]], [[Iran]] and [[Syria]].
* [[Ismaili]] Muslims who adhere to the [[Shi'a]] [[Ismaili]] [[Fatimid]] fiqh, follow the ''[[Daim al-Islam]]'', a book on the rulings of Islam. It describes manners and etiquette, including [[Ibadat]] in the light of guidance provided by the Ismaili Imams. The book emphasizes what importance Islam has given to manners and etiquette along with the worship of God, citing the traditions of the first four Imams of the Shi'a Ismaili Fatimid school of thought.
** Tāyyebī Mustā'līyyah: the [[Mustaali]] group of Ismaili Muslims differ from the Nizāriyya in that they believe that the successor-Imām to the Fatimid caliph, al-Mustansir, was his younger son al-Mustaʻlī, who was made Caliph by the Fatimad Regent [[Al-Afdal Shahanshah]]. In contrast to the Nizaris, they accept the younger brother al-Mustaʻlī over Nizār as their Imam. The Bohras are an offshoot of the [[Taiyabi]], which itself was an offshoot of the Mustaali. The Taiyabi, supporting another offshoot of the Mustaali, the [[Hafizi]] branch, split with the Mustaali Fatimid, who recognized [[Al-Amir]] as their last Imam. The split was due to the Taiyabi believing that [[At-Tayyib Abi l-Qasim]] was the next rightful Imam after [[Al-Amir]]. The [[Hafizi]] themselves however considered [[Al-Hafiz]] as the next rightful Imam after [[Al-Amir]]. The Bohras believe that their 21st Imam, Taiyab abi al-Qasim, went into seclusion and established the offices of the [[Da'i al-Mutlaq]] (الداعي المطلق), Ma'zoon (مأذون) and Mukasir (مكاسر). The Bohras are the only surviving branch of the Mustaali and themselves have split into the [[Dawoodi Bohra]], [[Sulaimani Bohra]], and [[Alavi Bohra]].
** [[Nizari]]: the largest branch (95%) of [[Ismā'īlī]], they are the only Shia group to have their absolute temporal leader in the rank of Imamate, which is currently invested in [[Aga Khan IV]]. Their present living Imam is [[Mawlānā]] [[Shah Karim Al-Husayni]] who is the 49th Imam. [[Nizārī Ismā'īlī]]s believe that the successor-Imām to the [[Fatimid]] caliph [[Ma'ad al-Mustansir Billah]] was his elder son [[Nizar (Fatimid Imam)|al-Nizār]]. While ''[[Nizārī]]'' belong to the "[[Imami]] jurisprudence" or [[Ja'fari jurisprudence|Ja'fāriyya Madhab ''(school of Jurisprudence)'']], believed by Shias to be founded by Imam [[Jafar Sadiq|Ja'far as-Sadiq]] they adhere to sumpremacy of "[[Kalam]]", in the interpretation of scripture, and believe in the temporal relativism of understanding, as opposed to fiqh ''(traditional [[nomianism|legalism]]),'' which adheres to an [[Moral absolutism|absolutism]] approach to [[revelation]].
* [[Zaidiyyah|Zaidi]] jurisprudence follows the teachings of [[Zayd ibn Ali]]. In terms of law, the Zaidi school is quite similar to the Hanafi school from Sunni Islam.&lt;ref name="Sayyid 2005"&gt;Article by Sayyid 'Ali ibn 'Ali Al-Zaidi, التاريخ الصغير عن الشيعة اليمنيين (A short History of the Yemenite Shi‘ites, 2005)&lt;/ref&gt; This is likely due to the general trend of Sunni resemblance within Zaidi beliefs. After the passing of Muhammad, Imam [[Jafar al-Sadiq]], Imam [[Zayd ibn Ali]], Imams [[Abu Hanifa]] and Imam [[Malik ibn Anas]] worked together in [[Al-Masjid an-Nabawi]] in Medina along with over 70 other leading jurists and scholars{{fact|date=November 2018}}. [[Jafar al-Sadiq]] and [[Zayd ibn Ali]] did not themselves write any books{{fact|date=November 2018}}. But their views are Hadiths in the books written by Imams [[Abu Hanifa]] and Imam [[Malik ibn Anas]]. Therefore, the [[Zaydis]] to this day and originally the [[Fatimids]], used the Hanafi jurisprudence, as do most Sunnis.&lt;ref name="books.google.co.uk"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2ElRUvoVRxYC&amp;pg=PA118&amp;dq=Zaydis+use+hanafi&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=OSQiUeC5HrKM0wWjmIBI&amp;ved=0CC4Q6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=Zaydis%20use%20hanafi&amp;f=false|title=Islamic Finance|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{better source|date=November 2018}}&lt;ref name="Arab-Israeli Conflict Page 917"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=YAd8efHdVzIC&amp;pg=PA917&amp;dq=Zaydis+use+hanafi&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=OSQiUeC5HrKM0wWjmIBI&amp;ved=0CDQQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=Zaydis%20use%20hanafi&amp;f=false|title=The Encyclopedia of the Arab-Israeli Conflict: A Political, Social, and ...|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="The Iraq Effect Page 91"&gt;{{better source|date=November 2018}}{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=i-3LAlfW7DIC&amp;pg=PA91&amp;dq=Zaydis+use+hanafi&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=OSQiUeC5HrKM0wWjmIBI&amp;ved=0CEoQ6AEwBQ#v=onepage&amp;q=Zaydis%20use%20hanafi&amp;f=false|title=The Iraq Effect|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{better source|date=November 2018}}

===Ibadi ===
The [[Ibadi]] school of Islam is named after [[Abd-Allah ibn Ibadh]], though he is not necessarily the main figure of the school in the eyes of its adherents. Ibadism is distinct from both Sunni and Shi'ite Islam not only in terms of its jurisprudence, but also its core beliefs.

In [[linguistics]], the '''minimalist program''' ('''MP''') is a major line of inquiry that has been developing inside [[generative grammar]] since the early 1990s, starting with a 1993 paper by [[Noam Chomsky]].&lt;ref&gt;Chomsky, Noam. 1993. ''A minimalist program for linguistic theory''. MIT occasional papers in linguistics no. 1. Cambridge, Massachusetts: Distributed by MIT Working Papers in Linguistics.&lt;/ref&gt;

Chomsky presents MP as a [[research program|program]], not as a theory, following [[Imre Lakatos]]'s distinction.&lt;ref&gt;For a thorough discussion of this distinction in the context of linguistics, see Boeckx, Cedric. 2006. ''Linguistic Minimalism: Origins, Concepts, Methods, and Aims''. Oxford: Oxford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; The MP seeks to be a mode of inquiry characterized by the flexibility of the multiple directions that its minimalism enables. Ultimately, the MP provides a conceptual framework used to guide the development of linguistic theory. In minimalism, [[Noam Chomsky|Chomsky]] attempts to approach [[universal grammar]] from below—that is, proposing the question "what would be the optimal answer to what the theory of [[i-Language]] should be?"

For Chomsky, there are [[Minimalist grammar|minimalist]] questions, but the answers can be framed in any theory. Of all these questions, the two that play the most crucial role are:&lt;ref&gt;Boeckx, Cedric ''Linguistic Minimalism. Origins, Concepts, Methods and Aims'', pp. 84 and 115.&lt;/ref&gt; 
*What is language?
*Why does it have the properties it has?

== Theoretical goals ==

=== Perfection ===

The MP appeals to the idea that the language ability in humans shows signs of being incorporated under an optimal design with exquisite organization, which seems to suggest that the inner workings conform to a very simple computational law or a particular mental organ. In other words, the MP works on the assumption that [[universal grammar]] constitutes a perfect design in the sense that it contains only what is necessary to meet humans' conceptual and physical (phonological) needs.&lt;ref&gt;Boeckx, Cedric. 2006. ''Linguistic Minimalism. Origins, Concepts, Methods and Aims''. Oxford: Oxford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

From a theoretical standpoint, and in the context of [[generative grammar]], the MP draws on the minimalist approach of the [[principles and parameters]] program, considered to be the ultimate standard theoretical model that generative linguistics has developed since the 1980s. What this approach suggests is the existence of a fixed set of principles valid for all languages, which, when combined with settings for a finite set of binary switches (parameters), may describe the specific properties that characterize the language system a child eventually comes to attain.&lt;ref&gt;There are many introductions to Principle and Parameters. Two that align PP in such a way that make the transition to MP smooth are Carnie, Andrew. 2006. ''Syntax: A Generative Introduction'', 2nd Edition. Malden, MA: Blackwell, and Cook, Vivian J. and Newson, Mark. 2007. ''Chomsky's Universal Grammar: An Introduction''. Third Edition. Malden, MA: Blackwell.&lt;/ref&gt;

The MP aims to get to know how much of the [[principles and parameters]] model can be taken as a result of this hypothetical optimal and computationally efficient design of the human language faculty. In turn, more developed versions of the [[Principles and Parameters]] approach provide technical principles from which the MP can be seen to follow.&lt;ref&gt;For a detailed introductory discussion between the transition of the technicalities from PP to MP see, among others, Gert Webelhuth. 1995. ''Government and Binding Theory and the Minimalist Program: Principles and Parameters in Syntactic Theory''. Wiley-Blackwell; Uriagereka, Juan. 1998. ''Rhyme and Reason. An Introduction to Minimalist Syntax''. Cambridge, Massachusetts: [[MIT Press]]; Hornstein, Norbert, Jairo Nunes and Kleanthes K. Grohmann. 2005. ''Understanding Minimalism''. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press; and Boeckx, Cedric. 2006. ''Linguistic Minimalism. Origins, Concepts, Methods and Aims''. Oxford: Oxford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Economy ===

The MP aims at the further development of ideas involving ''economy of derivation'' and ''economy of representation'', which had started to become significant in the early 1990s, but were still peripheral aspects of [[transformational grammar]].&lt;ref&gt;For a full description of the checking mechanism see Adger, David. 2003. ''Core Syntax. A Minimalist Approach''. Oxford: Oxford University Press; and also Carnie, Andrew. 2006. ''Syntax: A Generative Introduction'', 2nd Edition. Blackwell Publishers&lt;/ref&gt;
* Economy of derivation is a principle stating that movements (i.e., transformations) only occur in order to match ''interpretable features'' with ''uninterpretable features''. An example of an interpretable feature is the plural [[inflection]] on regular English nouns, e.g., ''dog'''s'''''. The word ''dogs'' can only be used to refer to several dogs, not a single dog, and so this inflection contributes to meaning, making it ''interpretable''. English verbs are inflected according to the [[grammatical number|number]] of their subject (e.g., "Dogs bite" vs. "A dog bite'''''s'''''"), but this information is only interpretable once a relationship is formed between the subject and the verb, so movement of the subject is required.
* Economy of representation is the principle that grammatical structures must exist for a purpose, i.e., the structure of a sentence should be no larger or more complex than required to satisfy constraints on grammaticality, which are equivalent to constraints on the mapping between the conceptual/intentional and sensori-motor interfaces in the optimal system that minimalism seeks to explore.

== Technical innovations ==

The exploration of minimalist questions has led to several radical changes in the technical apparatus of transformational generative grammatical theory. Some of the most important are:&lt;ref&gt;For some conceptual and empirical advantages of the MP over the traditional view see: Bošković, Željko. 1994. D-Structure, Θ-Criterion, and Movement into Θ-Positions. Linguistic Analysis 24: 247–286, and for more detailed discussions Bošković, Željko and Howard Lasnik (eds). 2006. ''Minimalist Syntax: The Essential Readings''. Malden, MA: Blackwell.&lt;/ref&gt;
* The generalization of [[X-bar theory]] into bare phrase structure (see below).
* The simplification of representational levels in the grammatical model, eliminating the distinction between [[deep structure and surface structure]] in favor of a more explicitly derivational approach.
* The elimination of the notion of [[Government (linguistics)|government]].
* The inclusion of a two new points of interaction, namely, a "spell-out" point between syntax and the interface with the phonological form, and an additional point of interaction with the logical form.
* The idea that syntactic derivations proceed by clearly delineated stages called "phases" (see below).

=== Bare phrase structure ===

A major development of MP inquiry is bare phrase structure (BPS), a theory of [[Phrase structure rules|phrase structure]] (sentence building prior to movement) developed by [[Noam Chomsky]].&lt;ref&gt;See Chomsky, Noam. 1995. Bare Phrase Structure. In ''Evolution and Revolution in Linguistic Theory. Essays in honor of Carlos Otero''., eds. Hector Campos and Paula Kempchinsky, 51–109.&lt;/ref&gt; The introduction of BPS has moved the Chomskyan tradition toward the [[dependency grammar]] tradition, which operates with significantly less structure than most [[phrase structure grammar]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Osborne, Timothy, Michael Putnam, and Thomas Gross 2011. Bare phrase structure, label-less structures, and specifier-less syntax: Is Minimalism becoming a dependency grammar? The Linguistic Review 28: 315–364&lt;/ref&gt;

This theory contrasts with [[X-bar theory]], which preceded it, in four important ways:

# BPS is explicitly derivational. That is, it is built from the bottom up, bit by bit. In contrast, X-bar theory is representational—a structure for a given construction is built in one fell swoop, and [[lexical items]] are inserted into the structure.
# BPS does not have a preconceived phrasal structure, while in X-bar theory every phrase has a [[Specifier (linguistics)|specifier]], a [[head (linguistics)|head]], and a [[complement (linguistics)|complement]].
# BPS permits only binary branching, while X-bar theory permits both binary and unary branching.
# BPS does not distinguish between a "head" and a "terminal", while some versions of X-bar theory require such a distinction.

BPS incorporates two basic operations: "[[Merge (linguistics)|merge]]" and "[[Move α|move]]". Although there is active debate on exactly how "move" should be formulated, the differences between the current proposals are relatively minute. The following description follows Chomsky's original proposal.&lt;!--so where is the discussion of move, then? The rest of this section only describes merge. Is move unimportant, or has it been forgotten?--&gt;

Merge is a function that takes two objects (say α and β) and merges them into an unordered set with a label (either α or β, in this case α). The label identifies the properties of the phrase.

Merge (α, β) → {α, {α, β} }

For example, "merge" can operate on the lexical items "drink" and "water" to give "drink water". Note that the phrase "drink water" behaves more like the [[verb]] ''drink'' than like the [[noun]] ''water''. That is, wherever the verb ''drink'' can be put, so too can the phrase "drink water":

I like to _____________ (drink)/(drink water).&lt;br&gt;
(Drinking/Drinking water) __________ is fun.

Furthermore, the phrase "drink water" can not typically be put in the same places as the noun ''water'':

It can be said, "There's some ''water'' on the table", but not "There's some ''drink water'' on the table".

So, the phrase is identified with a label. In the case of "drink water", the label is ''drink'' since the phrase acts as a verb. For simplicity, this phrase is called a verb phrase (VP). If "cold" and "water" were merged to get "cold water", this would be a noun phrase (NP) with the label "water"; it follows that the phrase "cold water" can appear in the same environments as the noun ''water'' in the three test sentences above. So, for ''drink water'', there is the following:

Merge (drink, water) → {drink, {drink, water} }

This can be represented in a typical [[concrete syntax tree|syntax tree]] as follows:

[[Image:Minimalist Tree Drink Water.png|150px]]

or, with more technical terms, as:

[[Image:Minimalist Tree VP.png|150px]]

Merge can also operate on structures already built. If it could not, then such a system would predict only two-word utterances to be grammatical. If a new head is merged with a previously formed object (a phrase), the function has the form

Merge &lt;code&gt;(γ, {α, {α, β}}) → {γ, {γ, {α, {α, β}}}}&lt;/code&gt;

Here, γ is the label, so that γ "projects" from the label of the head. This corresponds to the following tree structure:

[[Image:Minimalist Syntax Tree 1.png|150px]]

Merge operates blindly, projecting labels in all possible combinations. The [[subcategorization]] features of the head then license certain label projections and eliminate all derivations with alternate projections.

=== Phases ===
A "'''phase'''" is a syntactic domain first hypothesized by [[Noam Chomsky]] in 1998.&lt;ref&gt;Chomsky, Noam (1998). "Minimalist Inquiries: The Framework" MIT Occasional Papers in Linguistics 15. Republished in 2000 in R. Martin, D. Michaels, &amp; J. Uriagereka (eds.). ''Step By Step: Essays In Syntax in Honor of [[Howard Lasnik]]''. 89–155. MIT Press.&lt;/ref&gt; A simple sentence is often decomposed into two phases, CP and ''v''P (see [[X-bar theory]]). Movement of a constituent out of a phase is (in the general case) only permitted if the constituent has first moved to the left edge of the phase. This condition is described in the ''phase impenetrability condition'', which has been variously formulated within the literature. In its original conception, only the ''v''P in transitive and [[unergative verb]]s constitute phases. The ''v''P in passives and [[unaccusative verb]]s (if even present) are not phases. This topic is, however, currently under debate in the literature.&lt;ref&gt;See, among others, Legate, Julie Anne. 2003. Some Interface Properties of the phrase. Linguistic Inquiry 34: 506–516 and Chomsky, Noam. 2008. On Phases. In ''Foundational Issues in Linguistic Theory. Essays in Honor of Jean-Roger Vergnaud''. eds. Robert Freidin, Carlos Peregrín Otero and Maria Luisa Zubizarreta, 133–166. Cambridge, Massachusetts: MIT Press&lt;/ref&gt;

== Criticisms ==
In the late 1990s, [[David E. Johnson]] and Shalom Lappin published the first detailed critiques of Chomsky's minimalist program.&lt;ref&gt;Johnson, David E. and Shalom Lappin (1997), "A Critique of the Minimalist Program" in ''Linguistics and Philosophy'' 20, 273–333, and Johnson, David E. and Shalom Lappin (1999). ''Local Constraints vs Economy.'' Stanford: CSLI&lt;/ref&gt; This technical work was followed by a lively debate with proponents of minimalism on the scientific status of the program.&lt;ref&gt;*Lappin, Shalom, Robert Levine and David E. Johnson (2000a). "The Structure of Unscientific Revolutions." ''[[Natural Language and Linguistic Theory]]'' 18, 665–771&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Lappin, Shalom, Robert Levine and David E. Johnson (2000b). "The Revolution Confused: A Reply to our Critics." ''[[Natural Language and Linguistic Theory]]'' 18, 873–890&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Lappin, Shalom, Robert Levine and David E. Johnson (2001). "The Revolution Maximally Confused." ''[[Natural Language and Linguistic Theory]]'' 19, 901–919&lt;/ref&gt; The original article provoked several replies&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title=Am I Unscientific? A Reply to Lappin, Levine, and Johnson| year=2000 | last=Holmberg| first=Anders | journal=[[Natural Language &amp; Linguistic Theory]] | volume=18 | pages=837–842 | doi=10.1023/A:1006425604798}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title=Revolution, Discovery, and an Elementary Principle of Logic| year=2000 | last=Reuland| first=Eric | journal=[[Natural Language &amp; Linguistic Theory]] | volume=18 | pages=843–848 | doi=10.1023/A:1006404305706}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title=Caricaturing Dissent| year=2000 | last=Roberts| first=Ian| journal=[[Natural Language &amp; Linguistic Theory]] | volume=18 | pages=849–857 | doi=10.1023/A:1006408422545}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title=The Metric of Open-Mindedness| year=2000 | last=Piattelli-Palmarini| first=Massimo| journal=[[Natural Language &amp; Linguistic Theory]] | volume=18 | pages=859–862 | doi=10.1023/A:1006460406615}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title=On the Emptiness of 'Design' Polemics| year=2000 | last=Uriagereka| first=Juan| journal=[[Natural Language &amp; Linguistic Theory]] | volume=18 | pages=863–871 | doi=10.1023/A:1006412507524}}&lt;/ref&gt; and two further rounds of replies and counter-replies in subsequent issues of the same journal.

Lappin et al. argue that the minimalist program is a radical departure from earlier Chomskyan linguistic practice that is not motivated by any new empirical discoveries, but rather by a general appeal to ''perfection'', which is both empirically unmotivated and so vague as to be unfalsifiable. They compare the adoption of this paradigm by linguistic researchers to other historical paradigm shifts in natural sciences and conclude that of the minimalist program has been an "unscientific revolution", driven primarily by Chomsky's authority in linguistics. The several replies to the article in ''Natural Language and Linguistic Theory'' Volume 18 number 4 (2000) make a number of different defenses of the minimalist program. Some claim that it is not in fact revolutionary or not in fact widely adopted, while others agree with Lappin and Johnson on these points, but defend the vagueness of its formulation as not problematic in light of its status as a research program rather than a theory (see above).

An '''orthography''' is a set of [[convention (norm)|conventions]] for [[writing]] a [[language]]. It includes norms of [[spelling]], [[hyphen]]ation, [[capitalization]], [[word|word breaks]], [[Emphasis (typography)|emphasis]], and [[punctuation]].

Most significant languages in the modern era are written down, and for most such languages a standard orthography has been developed, often based on a [[standard language|standard variety]] of the language, and thus exhibiting less [[dialect]] variation than the spoken language. Sometimes there may be variation in a language's orthography, as between [[American and British English spelling differences|American and British spelling]] in the case of [[English orthography]]. In some languages orthography is regulated by [[List of language regulators|language academies]], although for many languages (including English) there are no such authorities, and orthography develops in a more organic way. Even in the latter languages, a significant amount of consensus arises [[natural language|naturally]], although a maximum of consistency or standardization occurs only when [[linguistic prescription|prescriptively]] imposed according to [[style guide]]s.

== Etymology and meaning ==
The English word ''orthography'' dates from the 15th century. It comes from the [[French language|French]] ''orthographie'', from [[Latin language|Latin]] ''orthographia'', which derives from [[Greek language|Greek]] ὀρθός ''orthós'', "correct", and γράφειν ''gráphein'', "to write".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?search=orthography&amp;searchmode=none orthography], Online Etymology Dictionary&lt;/ref&gt;

Orthography is largely concerned with matters of [[spelling]], and in particular the relationship between [[phoneme]]s and [[grapheme]]s in a language.&lt;ref&gt;Seidenberg, Mark S. 1992. "Beyond Orthographic Depth in Reading: Equitable Division of Labor." In: Ram Frost &amp; Leonard Katz (eds.). ''Orthography, Phonology, Morphology, and Meaning'', pp. 85–118. Amsterdam: Elsevier, p. 93.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Donohue, Mark. 2007. "Lexicography for Your Friends." In Terry Crowley, Jeff Siegel, &amp; Diana Eades (eds.). ''Language Description, History and Development: Linguistic Indulgence in Memory of Terry Crowley.'' pp. 395–406. Amsterdam: Benjamins, p. 396.&lt;/ref&gt; Other elements that may be considered part of orthography include [[hyphen]]ation, [[capitalization]], [[word|word breaks]], [[Emphasis (typography)|emphasis]], and [[punctuation]].&lt;ref&gt;Coulmas, Florian. 1996. ''The Blackwell Encyclopedia of Writing Systems''. Oxford: Blackwell, p. 379.&lt;/ref&gt; Orthography thus describes or defines the set of symbols used in writing a language, and the rules regarding how to use those symbols.

Most [[natural language]]s developed as oral languages, and [[writing system]]s have usually been crafted or adapted as ways of representing the spoken language. The rules for doing this tend to become [[standardization|standardized]] for a given language, leading to the development of an orthography that is generally considered "correct". In [[linguistics]] the term ''orthography'' is often used to refer to any method of writing a language, without judgment as to right and wrong, with a scientific understanding that orthographic standardization exists on a spectrum of strength of convention. The original sense of the word, though, implies a dichotomy of correct and incorrect, and the word is still most often used to refer specifically to a thoroughly standardized, [[prescriptive linguistics|prescriptively]] correct, way of writing a language. A distinction may be made here between [[emic and etic|''etic'' and ''emic'']] viewpoints: the purely descriptive (etic) approach, which simply considers any system that is actually used—and the emic view, which takes account of language users' perceptions of correctness.

==Units and notation==
Orthographic units, such as letters of an [[alphabet]], are technically called [[grapheme]]s. These are a type of [[abstraction]], analogous to the [[phoneme]]s of spoken languages; different physical forms of written symbols are considered to represent the same grapheme if the differences between them are not significant for meaning. For example, different forms of the letter "b" are all considered to represent a single grapheme in the orthography of, say, English.
 
Graphemes or sequences of them are sometimes placed between angle brackets, as in {{angbr|b}} or {{angbr|back}}. This distinguishes them from phonemic transcription, which is placed between slashes ({{IPA|/b/}}, {{IPA|/bæk/}}), and from [[phonetic transcription]], which is placed between square brackets ({{IPA|[b]}}, {{IPA|[bæk]}}).

== Types ==
The [[writing systems]] on which orthographies are based can be divided into a number of types, depending on what type of unit each symbol serves to represent. The principal types are ''[[logogram|logographic]]'' (with symbols representing words or [[morpheme]]s), ''[[syllabary|syllabic]]'' (with symbols representing syllables), and ''[[alphabet]]ic'' (with symbols roughly representing [[phoneme]]s). Many writing systems combine features of more than one of these types, and a number of detailed classifications have been proposed. Japanese is an example of a language that can be written in all three: logographic [[kanji]], syllabic [[hiragana]] and [[katakana]], and alphabetic [[romaji]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Koda|first1=Keiko|last2=Zehler|first2=Annette M.|title=Learning to Read Across Languages|date=Mar 3, 2008|publisher=Routledge|page=17}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

==Correspondence with pronunciation==
Orthographies that use [[alphabet]]s and [[syllabary|syllabaries]] are based on the principle that the written symbols ([[grapheme]]s) correspond to units of sound of the spoken language: [[phoneme]]s in the former case, and [[syllable]]s in the latter. However, in virtually all cases, this correspondence is not exact. Different languages' orthographies offer different degrees of correspondence between spelling and pronunciation. [[English orthography]], for example, is highly irregular, whereas the orthographies of languages such as [[Russian language|Russian]], [[Spanish language|Spanish]] and [[Finnish language|Finnish]] represent pronunciation much more faithfully, although the correspondence between letters and phonemes is still not exact. [[Bosnian language|Bosnian]], [[Croatian language|Croatian]] and [[Serbian language|Serbian]] orthographies are remarkably consistent: approximation of the principle "one letter per sound".

An orthography in which the correspondences between spelling and pronunciation are highly complex or inconsistent is called a ''[[deep orthography]]'' (or less formally, the language is said to have ''irregular spelling''). An orthography with relatively simple and consistent correspondences is called ''shallow'' (and the language has ''regular spelling'').

One of the main reasons for which spelling and pronunciation deviate is that [[sound change]]s taking place in the spoken language are not always reflected in the orthography, and hence spellings correspond to historical rather than present-day pronunciation. One consequence of this is that many spellings come to reflect a word's [[morphophonemic]] structure rather than its purely phonemic structure (for example, the English regular past tense [[morpheme]] is consistently spelled ''-ed'' in spite of its different pronunciations in various words). This is discussed further at {{slink|Phonemic orthography|Morphophonemic features}}.

The [[syllabary]] systems of [[Japanese language|Japanese]] ([[hiragana]] and [[katakana]]) are examples of almost perfectly shallow orthographies—the kana correspond with almost perfect consistency to the spoken syllables, although with a few exceptions where symbols reflect historical or morphophonemic features: notably the use of ぢ ''ji'' and づ ''zu'' (rather than じ ''ji'' and ず ''zu'', their pronunciation in standard Tokyo dialect) when the character is a voicing of an underlying ち or つ (see [[rendaku]]), and the use of は, を, and へ to represent the sounds わ, お, and え, as relics of [[historical kana usage]].

The Korean ''[[hangul]]'' system was also originally an extremely shallow orthography, but as a representation of the modern language it frequently also reflects morphophonemic features.

For full discussion of degrees of correspondence between spelling and pronunciation in alphabetic orthographies, including reasons why such correspondence may break down, see [[Phonemic orthography]].

===Defective orthographies===
An orthography based on the principle that symbols correspond to phonemes may, in some cases, lack characters to represent all the phonemes or all the phonemic distinctions in the language. This is called a [[defective orthography]]. An example in English is the lack of any indication of [[stress (linguistics)|stress]]. Another is the [[digraph (orthography)|digraph]] ''th'', which represents two different phonemes (as in ''then'' and ''thin''). A more systematic example is that of [[abjad]]s like the [[Arabic alphabet|Arabic]] and [[Hebrew alphabet|Hebrew]] alphabets, in which the short vowels are normally left unwritten and must be inferred by the reader.

When an alphabet is borrowed from its original language for use with a new language—as has been done with the [[Latin alphabet]] for many languages, or Japanese [[Katakana]] for non-Japanese words—it often proves defective in representing the new language's phonemes. Sometimes this problem is addressed by the use of such devices as [[digraph (orthography)|digraphs]] (such as ''sh'' and ''ch'' in English, where pairs of letters represent single sounds), [[diacritic]]s (like the [[caron]] on the letters ''š'' and ''č'', which represent those same sounds in [[Czech language|Czech]]), or the addition of completely new symbols (as some languages have introduced the letter ''[[w]]'' to the Latin alphabet) or of symbols from another alphabet, such as the [[rune]] ''[[Thorn (letter)|þ]]'' in Icelandic.

After the classical period, Greek developed a lowercase letter system that introduced [[diacritic]] marks to enable foreigners to learn pronunciation and in some cases, grammatical features. However, as pronunciation of letters changed over time, the [[diacritic]] marks were reduced to representing the stressed syllable. In Modern Greek typesetting, this system has been simplified to only have a single accent to indicate which syllable is stressed.&lt;ref&gt;Bulley, Michael. 2011. "Spelling Reform: A Lesson from the Greeks". ''English Today'', 27(4), p. 71. {{doi|10.1017/S0266078411000575}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''phase-out of lightweight plastic bags in Australia''' is being pursued at local and state/territory level rather than nationally, with [[plastic bag]] bans implemented or pending in all [[states and territories of Australia|states and territories]] except [[New South Wales]]. Environmental groups have expressed their concern that [[Australia]] was lagging other countries in the [[phase-out of lightweight plastic bags]], including Botswana, Somalia and Tanzania.&lt;ref name="cormack"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Cormack|first1=Lucy|title=Australia falling behind third world on global map of plastic bag bans|url=http://www.smh.com.au/business/consumer-affairs/australia-falling-behind-third-world-on-global-map-of-plastic-bag-bans-20160407-go18ec.html|accessdate=13 September 2017|work=The Sydney Morning Herald|publisher=Fairfax Media|date=9 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2016 it was estimated that of the 5 billion plastic bags used annually by Australians, 150 million ended up as litter.&lt;ref name="cormack" /&gt;

In 2003 the [[Tasmania]]n town of [[Coles Bay, Tasmania|Coles Bay]] was the first location in Australia to ban plastic bags.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.mg.co.za/article/2003-04-29-tasmania-carries-ecofight-bans-plastic-bags| title=Tasmania carries eco-fight, bans plastic bags| date=29 April 2003| publisher= Mail &amp; Guardian| accessdate=3 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although in 2008 the then-Environment Minister [[Peter Garrett]] announced the [[Rudd Government (2007–10)|Rudd Government]]'s goal of a nationwide plastic bag ban by year's end, he later abandoned the initiative due to [[cost of living]] concerns and disagreement about the policy among state and territory governments.&lt;ref name="abc-2008-garrett"&gt;{{cite news|title=Garrett calls time on plastic bags|url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/2008-01-10/garrett-calls-time-on-plastic-bags/1008452|accessdate=13 September 2017|work=ABC News|publisher=Australian Broadcasting Corporation|date=10 January 2008|language=en-AU}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="2008-end"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Feneley|first1=Rick|title=Battle to bag the plastic goes on|url=http://www.smh.com.au/environment/battle-to-bag-the-plastic-goes-on-20081226-75l4.html|accessdate=13 September 2017|work=The Sydney Morning Herald|publisher=Fairfax Media|date=26 December 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; This led to states and territories pursuing their own approaches.&lt;ref name="2010-tas"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Darby|first1=Andrew|title=Ban on plastic bags spreads to Tasmania|url=http://www.smh.com.au/environment/ban-on-plastic-bags-spreads-to-tasmania-20101111-17pgm.html|accessdate=13 September 2017|work=The Sydney Morning Herald|publisher=Fairfax Media|date=12 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The introduction of the "Zero Waste" program in South Australia led to the first statewide lightweight bag ban being introduced in October 2008. It is estimated that this move has saved 400 million bags annually.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.zerowaste.sa.gov.au/plastic|title=Plastic Bag Ban|date=28 February 2011|publisher=Zero Waste South Australia|accessdate=2 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The most recent jurisdiction to announce a ban on plastic bags is [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]], to commence on a date to be announced in early 2018.&lt;ref name="age-vic-ban" /&gt;

Since 2018, the country's two largest supermarket chains, [[Coles Supermarkets|Coles]] and [[Woolworths Supermarkets|Woolworths]], voluntarily removed free lightweight plastic bags from their stores and began charging for reusable bags instead.&lt;ref name="coles-woolies"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Slezak|first1=Michael|title=Woolworths and Coles to phase out single-use plastic bags|url=https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2017/jul/14/woolworths-to-phase-out-single-use-plastic-bags-over-12-months|accessdate=13 September 2017|work=The Guardian|date=14 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The reusable bags are sold at 15 cents in both chains.

In [[Australia]], 6 [[1,000,000,000 (number)|billion]] HDPE bags were used in 2002.&lt;ref name="plastic bags AU"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.environment.gov.au/settlements/waste/plastic-bags/index.html|title=Plastic bags|date=5 November 2009|publisher=Australian Government|accessdate=1 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Usage reduced to 5.6 billion in 2004&lt;ref name="bag problems"&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.ecorecycle.sustainability.vic.gov.au/resources/documents/Plastic_Bag_Free_Challenge_-_Factsheet.pdf| title=Plastic Bag Fact Sheet | date=9 November 2005| publisher=Sustainability Victoria| accessdate=1 July 2012|format= pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; and 3.9 billion in 2007.&lt;ref name="plastic bags AU" /&gt; According to [[Keep Australia Beautiful]]'s 2015-16 National Litter Index, plastic bags made up 1% of the country's litter.&lt;ref name="thornton"&gt;{{cite news |last1=Thornton |first1=Trevor |title=In banning plastic bags we need to make sure we're not creating new problems |url=https://theconversation.com/in-banning-plastic-bags-we-need-to-make-sure-were-not-creating-new-problems-81253 |accessdate=14 October 2018 |work=The Conversation |date=21 July 2017 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="notreadysbs"&gt;{{cite news |last1=Christian |first1=Natasha |title=Why Australia may not be ready to ban plastic bags |url=https://www.sbs.com.au/news/why-australia-may-not-be-ready-to-ban-plastic-bags |accessdate=14 October 2018 |work=SBS News |date=5 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 2017, ''[[The Project (Australian TV program)|The Project]]'' and [[Clean Up Australia]] launched a [[Change.org]] petition for the premiers of the three states without plastic bag bans - Victoria, New South Wales and Western Australia - to "ban the bag".&lt;ref name="banthebag-news"&gt;{{cite news|title=Waleed Aly calls for nationwide ban|url=http://www.news.com.au/entertainment/tv/current-affairs/ban-the-bag-waleed-aly-calls-on-three-australian-premiers-to-ban-plastic-bags/news-story/7d8b5b5944bf7ec77fc6791380f15531|accessdate=13 September 2017|work=News.com.au|publisher=News Corp Australia|date=20 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; After a segment on ''The Project'' about the petition, #BanTheBag became the top trending topic on [[Twitter]].&lt;ref name="banthebag-news" /&gt; In February 2018, a motion was put in the Australian Federal Parliament calling for a nationwide ban of lightweight non-biodegradable plastic shopping bags.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://parlinfo.aph.gov.au/parlInfo/genpdf/chamber/hansardr/8f8fb221-5f56-4e53-b69a-e109f7156d20/0473/hansard_frag.pdf;fileType=application%2Fpdf|title=Plastic bag ban motion in Federal Parliament|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Senate inquiries into recycling and marine plastic pollution also led to tripartisan recommendations by the Liberal, Labor and Greens parties to ban all single-use plastics in the country by 2023 and for all states and territories to ban plastic bags.&lt;ref name="zhou-senate"&gt;{{cite news |last1=Zhou |first1=Naaman |title=All single-use plastics should be banned by 2023 Senate inquiry recommends |url=https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/jun/26/recycling-senate-inquiry-recommends-all-single-use-plastics-be-banned |accessdate=14 October 2018 |work=The Guardian |date=26 June 2018 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="cormack-senate"&gt;{{cite news |last1=Cormack |first1=Lucy |title=Plastic bag ban among recommendations by marine plastic senate inquiry |url=https://www.smh.com.au/environment/plastic-bag-ban-among-recommendations-by-marine-plastic-senate-inquiry-20160420-gob2lb.html |accessdate=14 October 2018 |work=The Sydney Morning Herald |date=20 April 2016 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===South Australia===

In November 2016 the Queensland Government announced it would ban plastic bags from 2018, after the Opposition promised that it would implement a ban if it won the next state election.&lt;ref name="abc-qld-to-ban"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Wiggins|first1=Nick|title=Queensland to ban single-use plastic bags from 2018|url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/2016-11-25/queensland-to-ban-single-use-plastic-bags-from-2018/8056084|accessdate=24 September 2017|work=ABC News|publisher=Australian Broadcasting Corporation|date=25 November 2016|language=en-AU}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Queensland to ban plastic shopping bags from 2018|url=https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/nov/25/queensland-to-ban-plastic-shopping-bags-from-2018|accessdate=24 September 2017|work=The Guardian|agency=Australian Associated Press|date=25 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The implementing legislation passed the Queensland Parliament on 6 September 2017, accompanied by a [[Container deposit legislation in Australia|container refund recycling scheme]].&lt;ref name="qld-official-bt"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Branco|first1=Jorge|title=Queensland's plastic bag ban is official, along with recycling refund|url=https://www.brisbanetimes.com.au/politics/queensland/the-qld-plastic-bag-ban-is-official-along-with-a-recycling-refund-20170906-p4yvqw.html|accessdate=24 September 2017|work=Brisbane Times|publisher=Fairfax Media|date=5 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Both initiatives are due to take effect on 1 July 2018.&lt;ref name="qld-official-bt" /&gt;

Two attempts by the [[City of Fremantle]] in 2013 and 2015 to introduce a citywide plastic bag ban were blocked through disallowance motions moved in the [[Western Australian Legislative Council]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Kagi|first1=Jacon|title=Fremantle plastic bag ban binned again in WA Parliament|url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/2015-10-14/fremantle-plastic-bag-bag-blocked-by-state-parliament-again/6852518|accessdate=23 January 2018|work=ABC News|publisher=Australian Broadcasting Corporation|date=14 October 2015|language=en-AU}}&lt;/ref&gt; In September 2017, the Western Australian Government announced it would commence a statewide plastic bag ban on 1 July 2018.&lt;ref name="abc-wa"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Trigger|first1=Rebecca|title=How will WA's plastic bag ban work?|url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/2017-09-12/plastic-bag-ban-announced-in-wa-but-how-will-it-work/8895770|accessdate=13 September 2017|work=ABC News|publisher=Australian Broadcasting Corporation|date=12 September 2017|language=en-AU}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="wa-toban"&gt;{{cite news|title=WA to ban plastic bags next year|url=https://thewest.com.au/news/environment/wa-to-ban-plastic-bags-next-year-ng-s-1772065|accessdate=24 September 2017|work=The West Australian|date=12 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Victoria===
In mid-2017, Victoria's state government expressed its preference for a national ban, while confirming it would be open to a state-level ban in future.&lt;ref name="vic-fed-alone"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Heffernan|first1=Madeleine|last2=Preiss|first2=Benjamin|title=Victoria open to 'going it alone' on plastic bag ban if national deal not reached|url=http://www.theage.com.au/victoria/victoria-open-to-going-it-alone-on-plastic-bag-ban-if-national-deal-not-reached-20170725-gxi9av.html|accessdate=24 September 2017|work=The Age|publisher=Fairfax Media|date=27 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In October 2017, [[Daniel Andrews]] stated that Victoria would introduce a ban on plastic bags, with the start date to be announced in early 2018 after consultation with industry and the community.&lt;ref name="age-vic-ban"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Preiss|first1=Benjamin|title=Lightweight plastic bags to be banned in Victoria|url=http://www.theage.com.au/victoria/lightweight-plastic-bags-to-be-banned-in-victoria-20171017-gz2s4i.html|accessdate=23 January 2018|work=The Age|agency=Fairfax Media|date=18 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="conversation-vic"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Thornton|first1=Trevor|title=Victoria's plastic bag ban: a good start, but we can do more|url=http://theconversation.com/victorias-plastic-bag-ban-a-good-start-but-we-can-do-more-86149|accessdate=23 January 2018|work=The Conversation|date=25 October 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Government subsequently announced the plastic bag ban would commence by late 2019.&lt;ref name="theage-vic2019date"&gt;{{cite news |last1=Cunningham |first1=Melissa |last2=Preiss |first2=Benjamin |title=Victoria set to ban plastic bags by next year |url=https://www.theage.com.au/national/victoria/victoria-set-to-ban-plastic-bags-by-next-year-20180627-p4znxv.html |accessdate=14 October 2018 |work=The Age |publisher=Fairfax Media |date=27 June 2018 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===New South Wales===
The New South Wales Government currently has no plans to introduce a ban. In 2017 Premier [[Gladys Berejiklian]] stated that no regulation was needed because retailers responsible for 80% of plastic bags in the state (Coles, Woolworths and [[Harris Farm Markets|Harris Farm]]) would voluntarily stop providing free plastic bags themselves.&lt;ref name="nsw-not-needed"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Cormack|first1=Lucy|title=Plastic bag ban across NSW not needed if supermarkets act themselves: Premier|url=http://www.smh.com.au/business/consumer-affairs/plastic-bag-ban-across-nsw-not-needed-if-supermarkets-act-themselves-premier-20170724-gxhfbx.html|accessdate=24 September 2017|work=The Sydney Morning Herald|publisher=Fairfax Media|date=24 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2017 the country's largest supermarket chains, Woolworths and Coles, announced that they would stop providing free plastic bags to customers nationwide in 2018, and would sell thicker plastic bags for 15 cents each.&lt;ref name="ww-coles-2017"&gt;{{cite news |last1=Dulaney |first1=Michael |title=Woolworths and Coles to phase out plastic bags around the country |url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/2017-07-14/woolworths-to-phase-out-plastic-bags-around-the-country/8709336 |accessdate=14 October 2018 |work=ABC News |publisher=Australian Broadcasting Corporation |date=14 July 2017 |language=en-AU}}&lt;/ref&gt; Withdrawing free bags is expected to save the retailers $170 million per year in reduced packaging costs while creating a revenue stream from selling thicker plastic bags.&lt;ref name="windfall" /&gt;

==Alternatives to plastic bags==
A side-effect of the plastic bag ban observed in South Australia was the increased use of [[bin bag|bin liners]], which have a greater environmental impact than plastic bags as they do not break down well in modern landfills.&lt;ref name="binliner2017"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Chung|first1=Frank|title=Plastic bag ban: 'You don't actually need a plastic bin liner to put your rubbish out'|url=http://www.news.com.au/finance/business/retail/plastic-bag-ban-you-dont-actually-need-a-plastic-bin-liner-to-put-your-rubbish-out/news-story/629abba62ae7d5174208ca36d43615f2|accessdate=23 January 2018|work=News.com.au|agency=NewsCorp Australia|date=18 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Environmentally-friendly alternatives suggested instead of bin liners include [[composting]] food scraps and using free [[community newspaper]]s as liners instead.&lt;ref name="binliner2017" /&gt;

A 2007 report into shopping bag alternatives&lt;ref name=2007report&gt;{{cite report | last= Dili | first= Rae | date = 18 April 2007 | title = Comparison of existing life cycle analysis of shopping bag alternatives: Final Report | url = http://www.zerowaste.sa.gov.au/upload/resources/publications/plastic-bag-phase-out/LCA_shopping_bags_full_report%5B2%5D_2.pdf | publisher = Sustainability Victoria | format = PDF | access-date = 23 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; noted that paper bags were less environmentally friendly than plastic bags due to a higher [[carbon footprint]].&lt;ref name="wired-adler"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Adler|first1=Ben|title=Banning Plastic Bags Is Great for the World, Right? Not So Fast|url=https://www.wired.com/2016/06/banning-plastic-bags-great-world-right-not-fast/|accessdate=23 January 2018|work=WIRED|date=10 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, cotton bags were unsuitable due to the pesticides used and high volume of water needed to create them.&lt;ref name="wired-adler" /&gt; The "greenest" option was using recycled plastic bags.&lt;ref name="wired-adler" /&gt;

Concern has been expressed about potential unintended adverse health outcomes associated with the plastic bag ban rollout due to the lack of care by consumers in maintaining alternative shopping bags in a clean and healthy condition.  Overseas experiences in locations such as [[San Francisco]], where increased illness and even deaths were reported in the aftermath of similar bans to those in Australian states, suggest that this is a real concern.&lt;ref name="health-outcomes"&gt;{{cite news|title=Study links plastic bag ban with increase in food-related deaths|url=http://www.canberratimes.com.au/act-news/study-links-plastic-bag-ban-with-increase-in-foodrelated-deaths-20130208-2e2zf.html|accessdate=7 March 2018|work=Canberra Times|date=8 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Phone sex''' is a conversation between two or more people on the phone where one or more of the individuals is describing the act of sex.

Phone sex takes imagination on both parties' part; [[virtual sex]] is difficult if the operator does not put the images in the head of the caller and the caller must be open to the pleasure as well. The [[Dirty talk|sexually explicit conversation]] takes place between two or more persons via telephone, especially when at least one of the participants [[masturbate]]s or engages in [[sexual fantasy]].

Phone sex conversation may take many forms, including: guided fantasy, sexual sounds, narrated and enacted suggestions; sexual anecdotes and confessions; candid expression of sexual fantasies, feelings, or love, and/or discussion of very personal and sensitive sexual topics.

Once means of transmitting payment were developed, phone sex turned into primarily a commercial activity, with customers (overwhelmingly male) and sellers (overwhelmingly female).

== As a substitute for physical intimacy ==
Phone sex does not involve physical contact between those participating in it. Couples may choose to engage in phone sex when the inconvenience of distance makes [[physical intimacy]] inopportune.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

Due to the potential for emotional intimacy between those who have engaged in phone sex, it is a matter of some debate whether phone sex is to be considered [[infidelity]] when involving a person outside of a committed [[personal relationship]]. Nevertheless, phone sex should not be confused with [[prostitution]] wherein money is exchanged for real life sexual services or physical interaction.

==As a business==

===Origin===
The editor of ''[[High Society (magazine)|High Society]]'' magazine, [[Gloria Leonard]], is credited with being one of the first people to use "[[976 numbers]]", then "[[900 numbers]]" for promotional purposes and soon as a revenue stream in the [[adult industry]].&lt;ref name="avn_20140202"&gt;{{cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Leonard recorded her own voice informing callers of the contents of the next issue of ''High Society'' magazine before its publication. Later she recorded others such as [[Annie Sprinkle]] "[[Dirty talk|talking sexy]]". Leonard convinced magazine owner Carl Ruderman to purchase more of these numbers and the business began to be successful using the magazine to promote the service.&lt;ref name="avn_20140202" /&gt; Leonard herself was surprised at the success of these numbers.

=== Operation ===
Originally phone sex services consisted of a managed network of dispatchers (live or automated) and erotic performers. Performers would come to a studio where they received a cubicle, coaching, and cash incentives to keep callers on the line longer. This is the world portrayed in [[Spike Lee]]'s movie about phone sex, [[Girl 6]].  At that time independent phone sex was more dangerous, as Lee's movie portrays.

With the progress of technology it became more practical, convenient, and economical for providers to work out of their homes. Human dispatchers — female, except for gay male phone sex — answered the advertised phone numbers, processed payment via [[credit card]], chose who of the available performers in the dispatcher's judgment best matched the clients' fantasy (grandma, black girl, college girl, etc.), and connected the client with the provider. The caller could not see the performer's number. Either could hang up, though some services put economic pressure on providers not to do so.

Originally, per-minute billing was provided by phone companies (in the U.S., using  976, then 900 numbers). There was, from some services, an attempt to keep the caller aroused but short of orgasm, so he would spend more money. (This attitude still survives among some providers.) When public (mostly female) pressure forced the phone companies to stop providing this service to sex workers, a transition was made to a manual method: pre-paid blocks of time, 10, 30, 60 minutes, whatever the customer would pay for. The incentives for providers were then reversed; rather than earning money from keeping the customer on the line (orgasm delayed), they earned more from bringing the caller to orgasm quickly, so as to move on rapidly to another call. Unused minutes were rarely usable on a second call. The provider provided (say) 10 minutes of service, but got to keep all of the money (say 20 minutes).

When the Internet got relatively mature, sale of any sexual service not involving a minor could be made to anyone not a minor.  Software platforms were custom written to handle money collection and transfer, connecting caller and sex worker though neither could see anything but the platform's phone number, and metering the connection. Details vary significantly from one platform to another, but the provider may be given a personal page on the platform to use however she (sometimes he) wishes. All have some way for a provider to post a picture and some text. Big platforms as of 2016 are Niteflirt, TalktoMe, and My Phone Site;{{citation needed|date=July 2016}} the latter also includes provision by which a manager, with the consent of the providers, could have a [[virtuality|virtual]] shop with many providers under them. Foreign (non-US) customers were courted. Customers had a variety of payment options, and pages of providers to choose from, sometimes with voice samples available. In concept they have a lot in common with platforms such as [[Ebay]]: the seller provides the picture(s), description, and sets the price, a percentage of which is kept by the platform. In the sex industry, similar platforms emerged facilitating the selling of used panties and other odoriferous garments, and for "cam" video sessions, in which the customer, for a fee, can direct the woman on the video screen, and for a higher fee, have a private connection (no one can see caller or provider except each other).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

==== United States ====

By the end of the 1980s, nearly all of the major local phone companies in the United States, plus the major long distance carriers, were actively involved in the adult chat line business. The telephone companies would provide billing services for chat line companies. Typically the telephone companies would bill callers to chat lines and then remit 45% of the money collected to chat line operators. The telephone companies placed the chat line charges on a customer's local phone bill. If a customer disputed a charge, the telephone company would usually “forgive” the charge but block the caller from calling any other chat lines.{{cn|date=November 2018}} In 1988, the American phone sex industry generated an estimated $54 million annually (for both producers and telecommunications providers), according to the Information Industry Bulletin.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |quote=Commission officials estimated that Audio Enterprises collected $250,000 in revenue over a two-year period. Altogether, the dial-a-porn industry produces about $54 million annually in revenue for those who provide the messages and for teleephone companies, according to the Information Industry Bulletin. |publisher=''[[The New York Times]]'' |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1988/11/08/us/dial-a-porn-company-to-pay-a-50000-fine.html |title='Dial-a-Porn' Company to Pay a $50,000 Fine |author=[[The Associated Press]] |date=November 8, 1988}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By 2007 only Verizon, Sprint and AT&amp;T remained in the chat line business in the U.S. By 2007 Verizon and MCI had merged and only a few chat line companies remained active as a result. Verizon provided billing services to calls made in Massachusetts, Rhode Island and Maine. AT&amp;T and MCI offered nationwide collection services, with a cap of $50 per call.&lt;ref name="cnet_20060106"&gt;{{cite web

In 2002 profits from phone sex were estimated at one billion dollars a year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author= Helena Echlin|title=How I became a 'call' girl|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2002/jun/03/gender.uk|newspaper=The Guardian|date=3 June 2002|accessdate=16 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2007 the group [[Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington]] estimated that phone sex earned U.S. telephone companies close to $500 million per year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

The vast majority of modern services in the United States use [[toll-free]] numbers whereby clients can dial up to request a call with a particular performer using credit cards, [[ACH Network]] systems, and a variety of other billing methods. There are still some services that rely upon premium-rate telephone numbers (e.g., [[Premium-rate telephone number|976]] and 900 numbers) for billing purposes, although this practice has been largely abandoned due to the high rate of fraud associated with these lines and the inability to dial 900 and 976 lines from cellular phones. As a direct result, most telephone companies allow their customers to block outgoing calls to premium-rate telephone numbers. In 1996, the FCC changed regulations on 900 numbers to address abuse of these services by minors and fraud concerns.

Independent phone sex operators engage in self-promotion. This self-promotion can involve a personalized website where the phone sex performer lists their specialties and services, engaging prospects in social media, various methods of advertising (via the traditional methods listed below, or on organized third-party network sites that provide a basic level of privacy for performer and client alike) and/or surfing of sexually themed chat rooms for interested clients.

Phone sex service providers typically advertise their services in [[men's magazines]], in [[Pornography|pornographic]] magazines and videos, on late-night [[cable television]], and [[online]].  Some phone sex services use state-of-the-art customer acquisition techniques such as active [[database marketing]] to reach potential clients. These advertising methods almost invariably target men, the primary consumers of phone sex services.

The major phone sex and adult chat lines spend millions of dollars in advertising every month. Thanks to technology, their marketing departments can track the effectiveness of their advertising campaigns by assigning unique phone numbers to each advertising campaign, regardless if it includes TV, print, online or a combination of all these. Unique numbers might either be toll-free 1-800 numbers or local access numbers in order to accommodate callers who have been targeted in a local advertising campaign. Phone sex services will usually list all the local numbers on their websites. Assigning unique phone numbers to each advertising channel allows phone chat companies to measure not only the number of calls that each channel generates but also the price per call, conversion rate, and return on investment. This information can be further analyzed to determine key insights such as the most and least profitable caller's demographics, best and worst times to advertise and ultimately which advertising channels to invest more in and which ones to cut.

==== United Kingdom ====
Phone sex lines appeared in the UK in the 1980s using [[premium-rate telephone number]]s for adult services with sexual content, with many of the lines playing tape recordings. The phone sex market in the UK is closely linked to the pornographic magazine market, and advertising for such services often provides a vital element of a magazine's revenue. Up to a quarter of the page length of some magazines may be devoted to such advertisements.&lt;ref name=C&amp;S&gt;{{cite book|title=Encyclopedia of Contemporary British Culture|url=https://books.google.com/?id=tlsKXeRt0wgC&amp;pg=PA537&amp;dq=%22readers+wives%22#v=onepage&amp;q=%22readers%20wives%22&amp;f=false|date=2013|publisher= Routledge|editor1=Peter Childs|editor2=Michael Storry|isbn=9781134755554|page=537}}&lt;/ref&gt; Advertising in newspapers, which had been common in the 1980s, was ended as a result of regulatory changes in 1994 which restricted advertisements to top-shelf adult magazines. At the same time rules were introduced requiring the user to pro-actively opt-in by requesting a pin number. This dramatically reduced the number of calls, and the proportion of the income generated by premium-rate telephone numbers which was associated with adult services fell from 18% in 1992 to 1% in 1996. During the 1990s many companies began to re-route their traffic abroad in an attempt to circumvent the regulations. The industry took to operating from 40 countries worldwide, commonly Guyana and the Caribbean. In 1995 the income generated in this way was $2 billion. The regulations also led to an increase in the use of live call-back services paid by credit cards, which did not fall under the regulator's jurisdiction because they did not use premium-rate numbers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Sex|newspaper=The Independent|date=6 September 1996|accessdate=16 June 2016|author=Lesley Gerard |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/sex-1362202.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; By 2009 the proportion of the UK population that had used phone sex lines was 45%, according to a survey by [[Durex]]. By 2013 there were over 2,000 phone sex companies in the UK. Most phone sex workers are recruited through word of mouth or the internet as the companies are widely forbidden from advertising in mass media. The number of female university students working for phone sex lines in the UK doubled between 2011 and 2013, according to a [[BBC]]-commissioned investigation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Students and phone sex: 'Why not work as a phone sex operator and pay your way through University'|url=http://helpmeinvestigate.com/education/2013/05/students-and-phone-sex-why-not-work-as-a-phone-sex-operator-and-pay-your-way-through-university/|website=Help Me Investigate|author=Nicole Froio|accessdate=16 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The industry's regulatory body [[Phone-paid Services Authority]] (formerly ICSTIC and PhonePayPlus) monitors and enforces specific community standards in terms of content and price for premium rate numbers.

=== Legality ===

The legality of phone sex businesses was challenged by the U.S. Federal government in July 1988 with the passage of the [[Telephone Decency Act]], which made it a crime to use a "telephone ... directly or by recording device" to make "any obscene or indecent communication for commercial purposes to any person," punishable by a $50,000 fine or six months in prison." At the time the [[Federal Communications Commission]] (FCC) was responsible for policing 900 numbers for obscenity and indecency.&lt;ref name="avn_20140202" /&gt;

Sable Communications of California filed suit against the FCC in federal court to overturn the Telephone Decency Act. On July 19, 1988, U.S. District Judge [[A. Wallace Tashima]] ruled that "the prohibition against 'indecent speech' on 900-number recordings was unconstitutional, though its ban on 'obscene speech' could stand."&lt;ref name="avn_20140202" /&gt;

On June 23, 1989, the [[U.S. Supreme Court]] ruled that obscene speech, even in commercial telephone calls, was not protected, though indecent speech was. [[Justice Byron White]] wrote for the high court's majority
{{quote|There is no constitutional barrier under ''[[Miller v. California|Miller]]'' to prohibiting communications that are obscene in some communities under local standards even though they are not obscene in others." "Sable, which has the burden of complying with the prohibition, is free to tailor its messages, on a selective basis, to the communities it chooses to serve.&lt;ref name="avn_20140202" /&gt;}}

=== Workers ===

A phone sex worker is a type of [[sex worker]] and [[pornographic actor]], sometimes referred to as a "phone sex operator", "fantasy artist", "adult phone entertainer", "audio erotic performer", or any one of other monikers. The most valued attributes of a phone sex professional are his or her voice, acting  and [[sexual roleplay]] skills, along with the experienced ability to discern and respond appropriately to a broad spectrum of customer requests.&lt;ref name="voiceofshia"&gt;{{cite web

Several online companies provide Internet-based phone sex lines. These services enable callers to post profiles of themselves and then engage in [[VOIP]]-based and other types of online sex.

[[File:Simplified photorespiration diagram.jpg|thumb|Simplified photorespiration and Calvin cycle]]
'''Photorespiration''' (also known as the '''oxidative photosynthetic carbon cycle''', or '''C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; photosynthesis''') refers to a process in [[plant physiology|plant metabolism]] where the [[enzyme]] [[RuBisCO]] oxygenates [[RuBP]], causing some of the energy produced by photosynthesis to be wasted. The desired reaction is the addition of [[carbon dioxide]] to RuBP ([[carboxylation]]), a key step in the [[Calvin–Benson cycle]], however approximately 25% of reactions by RuBisCO instead add oxygen to RuBP ([[Oxygenase|oxygenation]]), creating a product that cannot be used within the Calvin–Benson cycle. This process reduces the efficiency of photosynthesis, potentially reducing photosynthetic output by 25% in [[C3 carbon fixation|{{C3}} plants]].&lt;ref name="Sharkey"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Sharkey, Thomas |title=Estimating the rate of photorespiration in leaves |journal=Physiologia Plantarum |volume=73 |issue=1 |pages=147–152 |year=1988 |doi=10.1111/j.1399-3054.1988.tb09205.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Photorespiration involves a complex network of enzyme reactions that exchange metabolites between [[chloroplast]]s, leaf [[peroxisome]]s and [[mitochondria]].

The oxygenation reaction of RuBisCO is a wasteful process because [[3-Phosphoglyceric acid|3-phosphoglycerate]] is created at a reduced rate and higher metabolic cost compared with [[Calvin cycle|RuBP carboxylase activity]]. While photorespiratory carbon cycling results in the formation of [[Glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate|G3P]] eventually, there is still a net loss of carbon (around 25% of carbon fixed by photosynthesis is re-released as {{CO2}})&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Leegood | first1 = R. C. | year = 2007 | title = A welcome diversion from photorespiration | url = | journal = Nature Biotechnology | volume = 25 | issue = 5| pages = 539–540 | doi=10.1038/nbt0507-539 | pmid=17483837}}&lt;/ref&gt; and nitrogen, as [[ammonia]]. [[Ammonia]] must be detoxified at a substantial cost to the cell. Photorespiration also incurs a direct cost of one [[Adenosine triphosphate|ATP]] and one [[NAD(P)H]].

While it is common to refer to the entire process as photorespiration, technically the term refers only to the metabolic network which acts to rescue the products of the oxygenation reaction (phosphoglycolate).

==Photorespiratory reactions==
[[File:Photorespiration eng.png|thumb|300px|Photorespiration]]
[[File:Photorespiration.svg|thumb|350px|Photorespiration]]
Addition of molecular oxygen to ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate produces [[3-phosphoglycerate]] (PGA) and 2-phosphoglycolate (2PG, or PG). PGA is the normal product of carboxylation, and productively enters the [[Calvin cycle]]. Phosphoglycolate, however, inhibits certain enzymes involved in photosynthetic carbon fixation (hence is often said to be an 'inhibitor of photosynthesis').&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Peterhansel | first1 = C. | last2 = Krause | first2 = K. | last3 = Braun | first3 = H. -P. | last4 = Espie | first4 = G.

Glycerate reenters the chloroplast and by the same transporter that exports glycolate. A cost of 1 [[Adenosine triphosphate|ATP]] is associated with conversion to 3-phosphoglycerate (PGA) ([[Phosphorylation]]), within the [[chloroplast]], which is then free to re-enter the Calvin cycle.

There are several costs associated with this metabolic pathway; one being the production of [[hydrogen peroxide]] in the peroxisome (associated with the conversion of glycolate to glyoxylate). Hydrogen peroxide is a dangerously strong oxidant which must be immediately broken down into water and oxygen by the enzyme [[catalase]]. The conversion of 2× 2Carbon [[glycine]] to 1 C3 [[serine]] in the mitochondria by the enzyme glycine-decarboxylase is a key step, which releases {{CO2}}, NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, and reduces NAD to NADH. Thus, 1 {{chem|CO|2}} molecule is produced for every 2 molecules of {{chem|O|2}} (two deriving from the activity of RuBisCO, the third from peroxisomal oxidations). The assimilation of NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; occurs via the [[Glutamine synthetase|GS]]-[[Glutamine oxoglutarate aminotransferase|GOGAT]] cycle, at a cost of one ATP and one NADPH.

[[Cyanobacteria]] have three possible pathways through which they can metabolise 2-phosphoglycolate. They are unable to grow if all three pathways are knocked out, despite having a carbon concentrating mechanism that should dramatically reduce the rate of photorespiration [[#Biological adaptation to minimize photorespiration|(see below)]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Eisenhut | first1 = M. | last2 = Ruth | first2 = W. | last3 = Haimovich | first3 = M. | last4 = Bauwe | first4 = H. | last5 = Kaplan | first5 = A. | last6 = Hagemann | first6 = M. | doi = 10.1073/pnas.0807043105 | title = The photorespiratory glycolate metabolism is essential for cyanobacteria and might have been conveyed endosymbiontically to plants | journal = Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences | volume = 105 | issue = 44 | pages = 17199–204 | year = 2008 | pmid =  18957552| pmc = 2579401}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Substrate specificity of RuBisCO==
The oxidative photosynthetic carbon cycle reaction is [[catalyst|catalyzed]] by [[RuBisCO|RuBP oxygenase]] activity:

:[[Ribulose 1,5-bisphosphate|RuBP]] + {{chem|O|2}} &amp;rarr; Phosphoglycolate + [[Glycerate 3-phosphate|3-phosphoglycerate]] + 2{{chem|H|+}}

[[File:RuBisCO reaction O2.svg|thumb|350px|Oxygenase activity of RuBisCO]]
During the catalysis by RuBisCO, an 'activated' intermediate is formed (an enediol intermediate) in the RuBisCO active site. This intermediate is able to react with either {{chem|CO|2}} or {{chem|O|2}}. It has been demonstrated that the specific shape of the RuBisCO active site acts to encourage reactions with {{chem|CO|2}}. Although there is a significant "failure" rate (~25% of reactions are oxygenation rather than carboxylation), this represents significant favouring of {{chem|CO|2}}, when the relative abundance of the two gases is taken into account: in the current atmosphere, {{chem|O|2}} is approximately 500 times more abundant, and in solution {{chem|O|2}} is 25 times more abundant than {{chem|CO|2}}.&lt;ref name="Griffiths 2006"&gt;Griffiths, H. (2006). Designs on Rubisco" ''Nature'' 441(7096), 940–941. Retrieved from http://www.rsbs.anu.edu.au/profiles/graham_farquhar/documents/233TcherkezPNASNaturecommentary.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;
The ability of RuBisCO to specify between the two gases is known as its selectivity factor (or Srel), and it varies between species,&lt;ref name="Griffiths 2006"/&gt; with angiosperms more efficient than other plants, but with little variation among the [[vascular plant]]s.&lt;ref name="Ehleringer 1991"&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Ehleringer, J.

A suggested explanation into RuBisCO's inability to discriminate completely between {{chem|CO|2}} and {{chem|O|2}} is that it is an evolutionary relic:{{citation needed|date=October 2014}} The early atmosphere in which primitive plants originated contained very little oxygen, the early evolution of [[RuBisCO]] was not influenced by its ability to discriminate between {{chem|O|2}} and {{chem|CO|2}}.&lt;ref name="Ehleringer 1991"/&gt;

==Conditions which effect photorespiration==
Photorespiration rates are increased by:

===Altered substrate availability: lowered CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; or increased O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;===
Factors which influence this include the atmospheric abundance of the two gases, the supply of the gases to the site of fixation (i.e. in land plants: whether the [[stomata]] are open or closed), the length of the liquid phase (how far these gases have to diffuse through water in order to reach the reaction site). For example, when the stomata are closed to prevent water loss during [[drought]]: this limits the {{CO2}} supply, while {{chem|O|2}} production within the leaf will continue. In algae (and plants which photosynthesise underwater); gases have to diffuse significant distances through water, which results in a decrease in the availability of {{CO2}} relative to {{chem|O|2}}. It has been predicted that the increase in [[wikt:ambient|ambient]] {{CO2}} concentrations predicted over the next 100 years may reduce the rate of photorespiration in [[C3 carbon fixation|most plants]] by around 50%{{citation needed|date=March 2017}}.

===Increased temperature===
At higher temperatures RuBisCO is less able to discriminate between {{CO2}} and {{chem|O|2}}. This is because the enediol intermediate is less stable. Increasing temperatures also reduce the solubility of {{CO2}}, thus reducing the concentration of {{CO2}} relative to {{chem|O|2}} in the [[chloroplast]].

==Biological adaptation to minimize photorespiration==
Certain species of plants or [[algae]] have mechanisms to reduce uptake of molecular oxygen by RuBisCO. These are commonly referred to as [[Photosynthesis#Carbon concentrating mechanisms|Carbon Concentrating Mechanisms]] (CCMs), as they increase the concentration of {{chem|link=CO2|CO|2}} so that RuBisCO is less likely to produce glycolate through reaction with {{chem|O|2}}.

===Biochemical carbon concentrating mechanisms===
Biochemical CCMs concentrate carbon dioxide in one temporal or spatial region, through [[metabolite]] exchange. C&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; and CAM photosynthesis both use the enzyme [[Phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase]] (PEPC) to add {{chem|CO|2}} to a 3-Carbon sugar. PEPC is faster than RuBisCO, and more selective for {{chem|CO|2}}.

====C&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;====
[[File:Field, corn, Liechtenstein, Mountains, Alps, Vaduz, sky, clouds, landscape.jpg|thumb|Maize uses the C&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; pathway, minimizing photorespiration.]]
[[C4 carbon fixation|C&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;]] plants capture carbon dioxide in their mesophyll cells (using an enzyme called [[phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase]] which catalyzes the combination of carbon dioxide with a compound called phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP)), forming oxaloacetate. This oxaloacetate is then converted to malate and is transported into the bundle sheath cells (site of carbon dioxide fixation by RuBisCO) where [[oxygen]] concentration is low to avoid photorespiration. Here, carbon dioxide is removed from the malate and combined with RuBP by RuBisCO in the usual way, and the [[Calvin Cycle]] proceeds as normal. The {{chem|CO|2}} concentrations in the Bundle Sheath are approximately 10–20 fold higher than the concentration in the mesophyll cells.&lt;ref name="Ehleringer 1991" /&gt;

This ability to avoid photorespiration makes these plants more hardy than other plants in dry and hot environments, wherein stomata are closed and internal carbon dioxide levels are low. Under these conditions, photorespiration does occur in C&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; plants, but at a much reduced level compared with C&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; plants in the same conditions. C&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; plants include [[sugar cane]], [[maize|corn (maize)]], and [[sorghum]].

====CAM (Crassulacean acid metabolism)====
[[File:CAMplantgraph.jpg|thumb|300px|left|Overnight graph of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; absorbed by a CAM plant]]
CAM plants, such as [[cacti]] and [[succulent plant]]s, also use the enzyme PEP carboxylase to capture carbon dioxide, but only at night. [[Crassulacean acid metabolism]] allows plants to conduct most of their gas exchange in the cooler night-time air, sequestering carbon in 4-carbon sugars which can be released to the photosynthesizing cells during the day. This allows CAM plants to reduce water loss ([[transpiration]]) by maintaining closed stomata during the day. CAM plants usually display other water-saving characteristics, such as thick cuticles, stomata with small apertures, and typically lose around 1/3 of the amount of water per {{chem|CO|2}} fixed.&lt;ref&gt;''Plant Physiology'', Fifth Edition - Sinauer Associates, Inc. Taiz and Zeiger. 2010. Chapter 8, Page 222&lt;/ref&gt;

====Algae====
There have been some reports of algae operating a biochemical CCM: shuttling metabolites within single cells to concentrate {{CO2}} in one area. This process is not fully understood.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

===Biophysical carbon-concentrating mechanisms===
This type of carbon-concentrating mechanism (CCM) relies on a contained compartment within the cell into which {{CO2}} is shuttled, and where RuBisCO is highly expressed. In many species, biophysical CCMs are only induced under low carbon dioxide concentrations. Biophysical CCMs are more evolutionarily ancient than biochemical CCMs. There is some debate as to when biophysical CCMs first evolved, but it is likely to have been during a period of low carbon dioxide, after the [[Great Oxygenation Event]] (2.4 billion years ago). Low {{chem|CO|2}} periods occurred around 750, 650, and 320–270 million years ago.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Raven | first1 = J.

====Eukaryotic algae====
In nearly all species of [[Algae|eukaryotic algae]] (''[[Chloromonas]]'' being one notable exception), upon induction of the CCM, ~95% of RuBisCO is densely packed into a single subcellular compartment: the [[pyrenoid]]. Carbon dioxide is concentrated in this compartment using a combination of {{CO2}} pumps, [[Carbonic acid|bicarbonate]] pumps, and [[carbonic anhydrase]]s. The pyrenoid is not a membrane bound compartment, but is found within the chloroplast, often surrounded by a starch sheath (which is not thought to serve a function in the CCM).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Villarejo | first1 = A. | last2 = Martinez | first2 = F. | last3 = Pino Plumed | first3 = M. | last4 = Ramazanov | first4 = Z. | title = The induction of the {{CO2}} concentrating mechanism in a starch-less mutant of Chlamydomonas reinhardtii | doi = 10.1111/j.1399-3054.1996.tb06687.x | journal = Physiologia Plantarum | volume = 98 | issue = 4 | pages = 798–802 | year = 1996 | pmid =  | pmc = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Hornworts====
Certain species of [[hornwort]] are the only land plants which are known to have a biophysical CCM involving concentration of carbon dioxide within [[Pyrenoid|pyrenoids]] in their chloroplasts.

====Cyanobacteria====
[[Cyanobacteria]]l CCMs are similar in principle to those found in eukaryotic algae and hornworts, but the compartment into which carbon dioxide is concentrated has several structural differences. Instead of the pyrenoid, cyanobacteria contain [[carboxysome]]s, which have a protein shell, and linker proteins packing RuBisCO inside with a very regular structure.
Cyanobacterial CCMs are much better understood than those found in [[eukaryote]]s, partly due to the ease of genetic manipulation of [[prokaryote]]s.

==Possible purpose of photorespiration==
Reducing photorespiration may not result in increased growth rates for plants. Photorespiration may be necessary for the assimilation of nitrate from soil. Thus, a reduction in photorespiration by genetic engineering or because of increasing atmospheric carbon dioxide (due to fossil fuel burning) may not benefit plants as has been proposed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Rachmilevitch S, Cousins AB, Bloom AJ |title=Nitrate assimilation in plant shoots depends on photorespiration |journal=Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A.&lt;!-- to "US" per [[WP:NOTUSA]]? --&gt; |volume=101 |issue=31 |pages=11506–10 |date=August 2004 |pmid=15272076 |pmc=509230 |doi=10.1073/pnas.0404388101}}&lt;/ref&gt; Several physiological processes may be responsible for linking photorespiration and nitrogen assimilation. Photorespiration increases availability of NADH, which is required for the conversion of [[nitrate]] to [[nitrite]]. Certain nitrite transporters also transport [[bicarbonate]], and elevated CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; has been shown to suppress nitrite transport into chloroplasts.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Bloom | first1 = A.

Although photorespiration is greatly reduced in C&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; species, it is still an essential pathway{{snd}}mutants without functioning 2-phosphoglycolate metabolism cannot grow in normal conditions.

Although the functions of photorespiration remain controversial,&lt;ref name="Foyer"&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Foyer, C. H. |author2=Bloom, A.

The photorespiratory pathway is a major source of [[hydrogen peroxide]] ({{chem|H|2|O|2}}) in photosynthetic cells. Through {{chem|H|2|O|2}} production and pyrimidine nucleotide interactions, photorespiration makes a key contribution to cellular redox homeostasis. In so doing, it influences multiple signalling pathways, in particular, those that govern plant hormonal responses controlling growth, environmental and defense responses, and programmed cell death.&lt;ref name="Foyer"/&gt;

Another theory postulates that it may function as a "safety valve",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Stuhlfauth, t. |author2=Scheuermann, R |author3=Fock, H. P. |year= 1990|title=Light Energy Dissipation under Water Stress Conditions|journal=Plant Physiology|volume=92|pages=1053–1061|pmc=1062415|doi=10.1104/pp.92.4.1053|pmid=16667370|issue=4}}&lt;/ref&gt; preventing the excess of reductive potential coming from an overreduced [[NADPH]]-pool from reacting with oxygen and producing [[free radicals]], as these can damage the metabolic functions of the cell by subsequent oxidation of membrane lipids, proteins or nucleotides.

A '''Possum belly''', on a [[Drilling rig (petroleum)|drilling rig]], is a metal container at the head of the [[shale shaker]] that receives the flow of [[drilling fluid]] and is directly connected to and at the end of the [[flow line]]. A possum belly may also be referred to as a distribution box or flowline trap.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Skinner|first=Les|title=Oilfield jargon|url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m3159/is_9_226/ai_n15649426/|work=World Oil|accessdate=25 July 2010|date=Sep 2005}} {{Dead link|date=November 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The purpose of the possum belly is to slow the flow of the [[drilling fluid]] (after it has gained momentum from coming down through the [[flow line]]) so that it does not shoot off of the [[shale shaker]]s.

Possum bellies are generally used when [[bentonite]] or another form of "mud" is being used. During the use of [[freshwater]] or [[brine water]], the [[flow line]] generally either goes straight to the reserve pit, or into the [[steel pits]].

The possum belly derives its name from the similarity of its appearance to the underbelly of the female [[opossum|possum]]. Each of the chambers of the possum belly resemble an elongated teat similar to the ones found on female possums.

See [[Drilling rig (petroleum)]] for a diagram.

'''Radio astronomy service''' (also: ''radio astronomy radiocommunication service'') is, according to Article 1.58 of the [[International Telecommunication Union|International Telecommunication Union´s]] (ITU) [[ITU Radio Regulations|Radio Regulations]] (RR),&lt;ref&gt;ITU Radio Regulations, Section IV. Radio Stations and Systems – Article 1.58, definition: '' radio astronomy service / radio astronomy radiocommunication service''&lt;/ref&gt; defined as "A radiocommunication service involving the use of [[radio astronomy]]". Subject of this radiocommunication service is to receive [[radio wave]]s transmitte by [[astronomical object|astronomical]] or celestical objects.

;See also: {{main|Radio station|Radiocommunication service}}

==Frequency allocation==
The allocation of radio frequencies is provided according to ''Article 5'' of the ITU Radio Regulations (edition 2012).&lt;ref&gt;''ITU Radio Regulations, CHAPTER II – Frequencies, ARTICLE 5 Frequency allocations, Section IV – Table of Frequency Allocations''&lt;/ref&gt;

In order to improve harmonisation in spectrum utilisation, the majority of service-allocations stipulated in this document were incorporated in national Tables of Frequency Allocations and Utilisations which is with-in the responsibility of the appropriate national administration. The allocation might be primary, secondary, exclusive, and shared.
*primary allocation:  is indicated by writing in capital letters (see example below)
*secondary allocation: is indicated by small letters
*exclusive or shared utilization: is within the responsibility of administrations 

In line to the appropriate [[International Telecommunication Union region|ITU Region]] the frequency bands are allocated (primary or secondary) to the ''radio astronomy service'' as follows.

==Ancient Near East==
[[File:Ishtar vase Louvre AO17000-detail.jpg|100px|thumb|[[Inanna]]/[[Ishtar]] depicted wearing the ceremonial [[headdress]] of the [[high priestess]]]]
[[Ancient Near East]]ern societies along the [[Tigris]] and [[Euphrates]] rivers featured many shrines and temples or ''houses of heaven'' dedicated to various [[deities]]. The 5th-century BC historian Herodotus's account and some other testimony from the [[Hellenistic Period]] and [[Late Antiquity]] suggest that ancient societies encouraged the practice of sacred sexual rites not only in [[Babylonia]] and [[Cyprus]], but throughout the [[Near East]].

According to [[Herodotus]], the rites performed at these temples included sexual intercourse, or what scholars later called sacred sexual rites:

&lt;blockquote&gt;The foulest Babylonian custom is that which compels every woman of the land to sit in the temple of [[Aphrodite]] and have intercourse with some stranger at least once in her life. Many women who are rich and proud and disdain to mingle with the rest, drive to the temple in covered carriages drawn by teams, and stand there with a great retinue of attendants.  But most sit down in the sacred plot of Aphrodite, with crowns of cord on their heads; there is a great multitude of women coming and going; passages marked by line run every way through the crowd, by which the men pass and make their choice.  Once a woman has taken her place there, she does not go away to her home before some stranger has cast money into her lap, and had intercourse with her outside the temple; but while he casts the money, he must say, "I invite you in the name of [[Mylitta]]".  It does not matter what sum the money is; the woman will never refuse, for that would be a sin, the money being by this act made sacred. So she follows the first man who casts it and rejects no one. After their intercourse, having discharged her sacred duty to the goddess, she goes away to her home; and thereafter there is no bribe however great that will get her. So then the women that are fair and tall are soon free to depart, but the uncomely have long to wait because they cannot fulfil the law; for some of them remain for three years, or four. There is a custom like this in some parts of Cyprus.&lt;ref&gt;[[Herodotus]], ''[[Histories (Herodotus)|The Histories]]'' [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Hdt.+1.199 1.199], tr A.D. Godley (1920)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The British anthropologist [[James Frazer]] accumulated citations to prove this in a chapter of his magnum opus ''[[The Golden Bough]]'' (1890–1915),&lt;ref&gt;J.G. Frazer, ''The Golden Bough'', abridged edition (1922), [[s:The Golden Bough/Adonis in Cyprus|Chapter 31: Adonis in Cyprus]]; see also the more extensive treatment in the 3rd edition of ''The Golden Bough'', volumes 5 and 6 (published 1914). Frazer's argument and citations are reproduced in slightly clearer fashion by Fernando Henriques, ''Prostitution and Society: a study'' (3 vols., London : MacGibbon &amp; Kee, 1962–1968), vol. I, ch. 1.&lt;/ref&gt; and this has served as a starting point for several generations of scholars. Frazer and Henriques distinguished two major forms of sacred sexual rites: temporary rite of unwed girls (with variants such as dowry-sexual rite, or as public [[defloration]] of a bride), and lifelong sexual rite.&lt;ref&gt;Fernando Henriques, ''Prostitution and Society: a study'' (3 vols., London : MacGibbon &amp; Kee, 1962–1968), vol. I, ch. 1.&lt;/ref&gt; However, Frazer took his sources mostly from authors of [[Late Antiquity]] (i.e. 150–500 AD), not from the Classical or [[Hellenistic period]]s.&lt;ref&gt;[[Herodotus]] and [[Strabo]] are the only sources mentioned by Frazer that were active prior to the 2nd century AD; his other sources include [[Deipnosophistae|Athenaeus]], [[De Dea Syria|pseudo-Lucian]], [[Claudius Aelianus|Aelian]], and the Christian church historians [[Sozomen]] and [[Socrates of Constantinople]].&lt;/ref&gt; This raises questions as to whether the phenomenon of temple sexual rites can be generalized to the whole of the ancient world, as earlier scholars typically did. 

The research of Daniel Arnaud, Vinciane Pirenne-Delforge, Julia Assante, Stephanie Budin&lt;ref name = "Budin"/&gt; and others has cast the whole tradition of scholarship that defined the concept of sacred prostitution into doubt. Budin regards the concept of sacred prostitution as a myth—arguing that the practices described in the sources simply never existed. A more nuanced view, espoused by Pirenne-Delforge, suggests that ritual sex did exist in the Near East, but not in the Greek or Roman worlds in classical or Hellenistic times.&lt;ref name = "Budin"/&gt;

===Sacred marriage===

The practice of sacred prostitution has not been substantiated in any [[Ancient Near East]]ern cultures, despite many popular descriptions of the habit.&lt;ref&gt;[[James Frazer]] (1922), ''[[The Golden Bough]]'', 3e, [[s:The Golden Bough/Adonis in Cyprus|Chapter 31: Adonis in Cyprus]]&lt;/ref&gt; Through the twentieth century, scholars generally believed that a form of ''sacred marriage'' rite or ''[[hieros gamos]]'' was staged between the king of a [[Sumer]]ian city-state and the High Priestess of [[Inanna]], the [[Mesopotamian mythology|Sumerian goddess]] of sexual love, fertility, and warfare, but no certain evidence has survived to prove that sexual intercourse was included. Along the [[Tigris]] and [[Euphrates]] rivers there was a temple of Eanna, meaning ''house of heaven''&lt;ref&gt;é-an-na = sanctuary ('house' + 'Heaven'[='An'] + genitive) [John Halloran's Sumerian Lexicon v. 3.0 – see link below]&lt;/ref&gt; dedicated to [[Inanna]] in the Eanna District of [[Uruk]].&lt;ref&gt;Modern-day [[Warka (Iraq)|Warka]], Biblical [[Erech]].&lt;/ref&gt;

While there may well have been some religious prostitution in the temples of [[Inanna]]/[[Ishtar]], Assante suggests the concept of the 'sacred marriage' (''[[hieros gamos]]'') has been misunderstood. It was previously believed to have been a custom whereby the king coupled with the high priestess to represent the union of [[Dumuzid, the Shepherd|Dumuzid]] with [[Inanna]] (later called [[Ishtar]]).&lt;ref name=Day_2004&gt;John Day, "Does the Old Testament Refer to Sacred Prostitution and Did it Actually Exist in Ancient Israel?", in ''Biblical and Near Eastern Essays: Studies in Honour of Kevin J. Cathcart'', eds. Carmel McCarthy &amp; John F Healey (Continuum International Publishing, 2004), 2–21.&lt;/ref&gt; It is much more likely that these unions never occurred but were embellishments to the image of the king; hymns which praise Middle Eastern kings for coupling with the goddess [[Ishtar]] often speak of him as running 320 kilometres, offering sacrifices, feasting with the sun-god [[Utu]], and receiving a royal crown from [[Anu|An]], all in a single day. One scholar comments: "No one, to the best of my knowledge, has been so wooden-minded to propose that human actors played the role of Utu and An at the banquet."&lt;ref&gt;Sweet, R. "A New Look at the 'Sacred Marriage' in Ancient Mesopotamia", in E. Robbins and S. Sandahl, eds., Corolla Torontonensis. Studies in Honour of Ronald Morton Smith (Toronto, 1994) 85–104.&lt;/ref&gt; Not all authors are convinced, however.&lt;ref name=Day_2004 /&gt;

Other modern historians argue that the temple did house priestesses of the goddess, but there is no evidence that they performed any kind of sexual services in any [[Cult (religious practice)|cult]].&lt;ref&gt;Budin, Stephanie Lynn, ''The Myth of Sacred Prostitution in Antiquity''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Assante, Julia 1998.

===Code of Hammurabi===
In [[code of Hammurabi|Hammurabi's code of laws]], the rights and good name of female sacred sexual priestesses were protected.  The same legislation that protected married women from slander applied to them and their children. They could inherit property from their fathers, collect income from land worked by their brothers, and dispose of property. These rights have been described as extraordinary, taking into account the role of women at the time.&lt;ref&gt;The Sacred Prostitute: Eternal Aspect of the Feminine By Nancy Qualls-Corbett&lt;/ref&gt;

===Hebrew Bible===
The [[Hebrew Bible]] uses two different words for prostitute, ''zonah'' (זונה)&amp;lrm;&lt;ref name="zanah"&gt;Associated with the corresponding verb ''zanah''.{{cite web|title=Genesis 1:1 (KJV)|url=https://www.blueletterbible.org/lang/lexicon/lexicon.cfm?t=kjv&amp;strongs=h2181|website=[[Blue Letter Bible]]|accessdate=5 April 2018|language=en}} incorporating [[Strong's concordance]] (1890) and [[Gesenius]]'s Lexicon (1857). Also transliterated ''qĕdeshah'', ''q&lt;sup&gt;e&lt;/sup&gt;deshah'', ''qědēšā'' ,''qedashah'', ''kadeshah'', ''kadesha'', ''qedesha'', ''kdesha''. A modern liturgical pronunciation would be ''k'deysha''.&lt;/ref&gt; and ''kedeshah'' (or ''qedesha'') (קדשה)&amp;lrm;.&lt;ref name="zanah" /&gt; The word ''zonah'' simply meant an ordinary prostitute or ''loose woman''.&lt;ref name="zanah" /&gt; But the word ''kedeshah'' literally means ''consecrated'' (feminine form), from the Semitic root ''[[Q-D-Sh|q-d-sh]]'' (קדש)&amp;lrm; meaning ''holy'' or ''set apart''.&lt;ref name="zanah" /&gt; In spite of the cultic significance of a ''kedeshah'' to a follower of the [[Canaanite religion]], two verses makes it clear that cultic prostitution had no place within Yahweh's worship. {{bibleverse||Deuteronomy|23:17-18|NIV}}:

{{quote|None of the daughters of Israel shall be a ''kedeshah'', nor shall any of the sons of Israel be a ''kadesh''.

You shall not bring the hire of a prostitute (''zonah'') or the wages of a dog (''kelev'') into the house of the Lord your God to pay a vow, for both of these are an abomination to the Lord your God.}}

[[Stephen O. Murray]] writes that biblical passages ban ''qdeshim'' and link them with gods and "forms of worship detested by orthodox followers of Yahweh".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Murray |first=Stephen O. |title=Homosexualities |publisher=University of Chicago Press |year=2002 |page=295 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=HCikDlcEHw8C|isbn=9780226551951 }}
&lt;/ref&gt; Celia Brewer Sinclair has written that "the ethical demands of the covenant preclude worshiping Yahweh in licentious sexual rites (sacred sexual rites )".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Sinclair |first1=Mashal |last2=Brewer |first2=Celia |title=A Guide Through the Old Testament |publisher=Westminster John Knox Press |year=1989 |page=71 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=NopUi53PC0YC|isbn=9780804201247 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Male priests who engaged in same-sex sacred prostitution were called ''kadesh'' or ''qadesh'' (literally: male ''holy one''); the word evolved semantically in ancient Hebrew to take on a similar meaning to ''sodomite''.&lt;ref name="rictornorton.co.uk"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://rictornorton.co.uk/homopho1.htm|title=A History of Homophobia: 1 The Ancient Hebrews|publisher=|accessdate=18 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Unreliable source|sure=y|reason=topic is out of author's scope and area of expertise, essay is unsourced and does not represent scholarly consensus re: ancient history and Biblical studies|date=August 2017}} The Hebrew word ''kelev'' (dog) in the next line may also signify a male dancer or prostitute.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.blueletterbible.org/lang/lexicon/lexicon.cfm?t=kjv&amp;strongs=h3611 Lexicon results for ''kelev'' (Strong's H3611)], incorporating [[Strong's Concordance]] (1890) and [[Gesenius]]'s Lexicon (1857).&lt;/ref&gt; 

Some scholars see the injunctions against foreign worship, including male sacred prostitution, as possibly the original cause of what would later become Judaism's condemnation of sexual contact between men.&lt;ref name="rictornorton.co.uk"/&gt;{{Unreliable source|sure=y|reason=topic is out of author's scope and area of expertise, essay is unsourced and does not represent scholarly consensus re: ancient history and Biblical studies|date=August 2017}}

The Law of Moses (Deuteronomy) was not universally observed in Hebrew culture under the rule of King David's dynasty, as recorded in Kings.  In fact Judah had lost "the Book of the Law".  During the reign of King Josiah, The high priest Hilkiah discovers it in "the House of the Lord" and realizes that the people have disobeyed, particularly regarding Sacred Prostitution.&lt;ref&gt;2 Kings 22:8&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;Sweeney, Marvin A. King Josiah of Judah, Oxford University Press, 2001, p.137. {{ISBN|978-0-19-513324-0}}]&lt;/ref&gt;  Examples of male temple prostitution ("sodomites" [KJV, GNV]) being banned under King Josiah are recorded to have been commonplace since the reign of King Rehoboam of Judah (King Solomon's son). &lt;ref&gt;1 Kings 14:24, 1 Kings 15:12 and 2 Kings 23:7 &lt;/ref&gt;.  Modern bible translations refer to King Josiah's bans on "male temple prostitutes" [NRSV] or similarly "male shrine prostitutes" [NIV], where as older translations refer to the ban of "Sodomites" and "the Houses of the Sodomites" [KJV, GNV].  Under the polytheistic religious practices that were commonplace, homosexuality experienced a degree of cultural acceptance along with heterosexuality among the Hebrew tribes, but sacred prostitution was not allowed in conjunction with the worship of Yahweh, where these had been expressly forbidden in Deuteronomy, their sacred Book of Law under King Josiah.

In the [[Book of Ezekiel]], [[Oholah and Oholibah]] appear as the allegorical brides of God who represent [[Samaria (ancient city)|Samaria]] and Jerusalem. They became prostitutes in Egypt, engaging in prostitution from their youth. The prophet Ezekiel condemns both as guilty of religious and political alliance with heathen nations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://classic.net.bible.org/dictionary.php?word=OHOLIBAH|title=NETBible: Oholibah|publisher=|accessdate=18 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

So within Hebrew cultures involving pagan religions, both homosexual and heterosexual pagan temple prostitution experienced periods of acceptance, and periods of banishment, as under King Josiah.

===Sumer===
According to the noted Assyriologist [[Samuel Noah Kramer]], kings in the ancient Near Eastern region of [[Sumer]] established their legitimacy by taking part in a ritual sexual act in the temple of the fertility goddess Ishtar every year on the tenth day of the New Year festival [[Akitu]].&lt;ref&gt;S. N. Kramer, ''The Sacred Marriage Rite: Aspects of Faith, Myth and Ritual in Ancient Sumer''.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Hittites===
The [[Hittites]] practiced sacred prostitution as part of a cult of deities, including the worship of a mated pair of deities, a bull god and a lion goddess, while in later days it was the mother-goddess who became prominent, representing fertility, and (in Phoenicia) the goddess who presided over human birth.&lt;ref&gt;Nagendra Kr Singh, ''Divine Prostitution'' [https://books.google.com/books?id=nYEdPoGAaz0C&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;source=gbs_ge_summary_r&amp;cad=0#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false page 6], (1997)&lt;/ref&gt;

== Ancient Greece and Hellenistic World ==

===Ancient Greece===
{{Main|Prostitution in ancient Greece#Temple prostitution in Corinth}}
In [[ancient Greece]], sacred prostitution was known in the city of [[Ancient Corinth|Corinth]] where the [[Temple of Aphrodite (Corinth)|Temple of Aphrodite]] employed a significant number of female servants, ''hetairai'', during [[classical antiquity]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author1=Strabo|title=Geographica|url=http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Strabo/8F*.html|location=VIII.6.20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Greek term ''hierodoulos'' or ''hierodule'' has sometimes been taken to mean ''sacred holy woman'', but it is more likely to refer to a former slave freed from slavery in order to be ''dedicated'' to a god.&lt;ref name = "Budin"&gt;Stephanie Budin, ''The Myth of Sacred Prostitution in Antiquity'' (Cambridge University Press, 2009); more briefly the case that there was no sacred prostitution in Greco-Roman Ephesus by S.M.

===Hellenistic world===
In the Greek-influenced and colonized world, "sacred prostitution" was known in [[Cyprus]] (Greek-settled since 1100 BC), [[Sicily]] (Hellenized since 750 BC), in the [[Kingdom of Pontus]] (8th century BC) and in [[Cappadocia]] (c. 330 BC hellenized).{{cn|date=April 2017}}

==Ancient Rome and late antiquity==

===Ancient Rome===
{{Main|Prostitution in ancient Rome#Prostitution and religion}}

===Late antiquity===
The Roman emperor [[Constantine I|Constantine]] closed down a number of temples to [[Venus (mythology)|Venus]] or similar deities in the 4th century AD, as the Christian church historian [[Eusebius]] proudly noted.&lt;ref name="3.55" /&gt; [[Eusebius]] also claimed that the [[Phoenicia]]n cities of [[Afqa|Aphaca]] and [[Baalbek|Heliopolis]] ([[Baalbek]]) continued to practise temple prostitution until the emperor [[Constantine I|Constantine]] put an end to the rite in the 4th century AD.&lt;ref name="3.55"&gt;[[Eusebius]], ''Life of Constantine'', [http://www.ccel.org/ccel/schaff/npnf201.iv.vi.iii.lv.html 3.55] and [http://www.ccel.org/ccel/schaff/npnf201.iv.vi.iii.lviii.html 3.58]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Asia==

===India===
In Southern [[India]] and the eastern Indian state of [[Odisha]], [[devadasi]] is the practice of hierodulic prostitution, with similar customary forms such as basavi,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=What is child hierodulic servitude?|url=http://anti-slaverysociety.addr.com/hieroras.htm|website=[[Anti-Slavery Society]]|accessdate=5 April 2018|date= |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20160102084104/http://anti-slaverysociety.addr.com/hieroras.htm |archive-date=2 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and involves dedicating pre-pubescent and young adolescent girls from villages in a ritual marriage to a deity or a temple, who then work in the temple and function as spiritual guides, dancers, and prostitutes servicing male devotees in the temple. [[Human Rights Watch]] reports claim that devadasis are forced into this service and, at least in some cases, to practice prostitution for upper-caste members.&lt;ref&gt;Human Rights Watch. [http://hrw.org/campaigns/caste/presskit.htm Caste: Asia's Hidden Apartheid]&lt;/ref&gt; The devadasis were originally seen as intercessors who allowed upper-caste men to have contact with the gods. Though they did develop sexual relations with other men, they were not looked upon with lust. The system was criticised by British rulers, leading to decline in support for the system and the devadasis were forced into entering prostitution for survival.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.co.in/books?id=Fq5rDQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT143&amp;dq=devadasi+sexual+relations&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiBsOfhq5HdAhWBeisKHbRCDSMQ6AEIPzAE#v=onepage&amp;q=devadasi%20sexual%20relations&amp;f=false Women, Music, Culture: An Introduction] by Julie C.

Various state governments in [[India]] enacted laws to ban this practice both prior to India's independence and more recently. They include Bombay Devdasi Act, 1934, Devdasi (Prevention of dedication) Madras Act, 1947, Karnataka Devdasi (Prohibition of dedication) Act, 1982, and Andhra Pradesh Devdasi (Prohibition of dedication) Act, 1988.&lt;ref&gt;United Nations Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination against Women.

===Japan===
Sacred prostitution was once practised by the [[Miko]] within traditional [[Shinto]] in [[Japan]]. There were once Shinto beliefs that prostitution was sacred, and there used to be lodgings for the temple prostitutes on the shrine grounds. This traditional practise came to an end during the beginning of the [[Meiji era]], due to the encroachment of Western Christian morality, and the government implementing the ''[[Shinbutsu bunri]]''; which, among other things, drastically decreased the roles of the Miko, and modified Shinto beliefs until it became what is now colloquially referred to as [[State Shinto]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://fuzoku-style-jp.com/history/shinto.html Ways of thinking that connect religion and prostitution]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Kuly |first1=Lisa |title=Locating Transcendence in Japanese Minzoku Geinô : Yamabushi and Miko Kagura |journal=Ethnologies |date=2003 |volume=25 |issue=1 |page=198 |doi=10.7202/007130ar |url=http://www.erudit.org/revue/ethno/2003/v25/n1/007130ar.html |language=en |issn=1481-5974}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1970s and early 1980s, some religious cults practiced sacred prostitution as an instrument to recruit new converts.

A '''science slam''' is a scientific talk where scientists present their own [[scientific research]] work in a given time frame - usually 10 minutes - in front of a non-expert audience. The focus lies on teaching current science to a diverse audience in an entertaining way. The presentation is judged by the audience.&lt;ref name="Science in the Pub"&gt;[http://www.goethe.de/wis/fut/bko/en6483164.htm Article on "Science in the Pub"]&lt;/ref&gt; A science slam is a form of [[science communication]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3182">In [[theoretical computer science]] a '''simulation preorder''' is a [[Relation (mathematics)|relation]] between [[state transition system]]s associating systems which behave in the same way in the sense that one system ''simulates'' the other.

Intuitively, a system simulates another system if it can match all of its moves.

The basic definition relates states within one transition system, but this is easily adapted to relate two separate transition systems by building a system consisting of the [[disjoint union]] of the corresponding components.

==Formal definition==
Given a [[state transition system|labelled state transition system]] (S, Λ, →), a ''simulation'' relation is a [[binary relation]] R over S (i.e. R ⊆ S &amp;times; S) such that for every pair of elements (p,q) ∈ R, for all α ∈ Λ, and for all p' ∈ S, 

:&lt;math&gt; p  \overset{\alpha}{\rightarrow}   p' &lt;/math&gt;

implies that there is a q' ∈ S such that

:&lt;math&gt; q   \overset{\alpha}{\rightarrow}  q' &lt;/math&gt;

and (p',q') ∈ R.

Equivalently, in terms of [[Composition of relations|relational composition]]:
:&lt;math&gt;R^{-1}\,; \overset{\alpha}{\rightarrow}\quad {\subseteq}\quad \overset{\alpha}{\rightarrow}\,; R^{-1}&lt;/math&gt;

Given two states p and q in S, q ''simulates'' p, written p ≤ q if there is a simulation R such that (p, q) ∈ R. The relation ≤ is a [[preorder]], and is usually called the ''simulation preorder''. It is the largest simulation relation over a given transition system.

Two states ''p'' and ''q'' are said to be ''similar'', written p ≤≥ q, if ''p'' simulates ''q'' and ''q'' simulates ''p''. Similarity is an [[equivalence relation]], but it is coarser than [[bisimilarity]].

==Similarity of separate transition systems==
When comparing two different transition systems (S', Λ', →') and (S", Λ", →"), the basic notions of simulation and similarity can be used by forming the disjoint composition of the two machines, (S, Λ, →) with S = S' ∐ S", Λ = Λ' ∪ Λ" and → = →' ∪ →", where ∐ is the [[disjoint union]] operator between sets.

'''''The Formation of Vegetable Mould through the Action of Worms, with Observations on their Habits''''' (sometimes shortened to ''Worms'') is an 1881 book by [[Charles Darwin]] on [[earthworms]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Review of ''The Formation of Vegetable Mould, through the action of Worms, with observations on their Habits''|journal=The Quarterly Review|date=January 1882|pages=179–202|volume=153|url=https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=hvd.32044092526755;view=1up;seq=191}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was his last scientific book, and was published shortly before his death (see [[Darwin from Insectivorous Plants to Worms]]). Exploring earthworm behaviour and ecology, it continued the theme common throughout his work that gradual changes over long periods of time can lead to large and sometimes surprising consequences. It was the first significant work on soil [[bioturbation]], although that term was not used by Darwin (it first appeared in the soil and geomorphic literature one hundred years later).

==Paper "On the Formation of Mould"==
After returning from the [[second voyage of HMS Beagle|''Beagle'' survey expedition]] in October 1836, Darwin was intensively occupied with further establishing his reputation as an innovative geologist, as well as finding suitable experts to describe his [[natural history]] collections and arranging for publication of their work as the multi-volume ''[[Zoology of the Voyage of H.M.S. Beagle]]''. Near the outset of the voyage he had planned a book on geology, and during it extracts from his letters on geology had been privately published by his tutor [[John Stevens Henslow]]. Darwin now published papers on "proofs of recent elevation on the coast of Chili", "deposits containing extinct Mammalia" and "coral formations". He also rewrote his journal to incorporate observations from his notebooks as the book now called ''[[The Voyage of the Beagle]]'', and began brain-storming in his notebooks about [[transmutation of species]].&lt;ref name=vw&gt;{{Harvnb|van Wyhe|2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Darwin’s health suffered from the pressure of work, and on 20 September 1837 having been urged by his doctors "knock off all work" he visited his home in [[Shrewsbury]] then went on to stay with his relatives at [[Maer Hall]], Staffordshire, home of his uncle [[Josiah Wedgwood II|Josiah Wedgwood]]. Uncle Jos pointed out an area of ground where [[Agricultural lime|lime]] and [[cinders]] spread years previously had vanished into the soil, forming layers under a top layer of [[loam]]. Jos suggested that this might have been the work of [[earthworm]]s, but apparently thought that this would be of little interest to his nephew, who was working on continental scale geological problems.&lt;ref name=dm233&gt;{{Harvnb|Desmond|Moore|1991|pp=233–234}}&lt;/ref&gt; Actually, Charles did find it interesting and throughout his life he sustained an interest in this "unsung creature which, in its untold millions, transformed the land as the [[coral]] polyps did the tropical sea".&lt;!-- Add citation --&gt;

He returned to London on October 21st, and prepared a paper on worms forming mould.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Darwin|2006|pp=[http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?viewtype=text&amp;itemID=CUL-DAR158.1–76&amp;pageseq=22 12 verso–13 recto]}}&lt;/ref&gt; The paper on the role of earthworms in [[Pedogenesis|soil formation]] was read out by Darwin at the [[Geological Society of London]] on 1 November 1837.&lt;ref name=ew38&gt;{{harvnb|Darwin|1838}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was an uncommonly mundane subject for the society, and his peers may have hoped to hear of something more grandiose, even seeing this paper as highlighting Darwin's growing idiosyncrasies.&lt;ref name=dm233/&gt; The leading geologist [[William Buckland]] subsequently recommended Darwin's paper for publication, praising it as "a new &amp; important theory to explain Phenomena of universal occurrence on the surface of the Earth—in fact a new Geological Power", while rightly rejecting Darwin's suggestion that chalkland could have been formed in a similar way.&lt;ref name=Letter404&gt;{{Citation |url=http://www.darwinproject.ac.uk/darwinletters/calendar/entry-404.html |title=Darwin Correspondence Project – Letter 404 – Buckland, William to Geological Society of London, 9 Mar 1838 |accessdate=23 December 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The paper appeared in the ''Proceedings of the Geological Society of London'' in 1838,&lt;ref name=ew38/&gt; and was published with a [[woodcut]] illustration in the ''Transactions of the Geological Society'' in 1840.&lt;ref name=ew40&gt;{{harvnb|Darwin|1840}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Renewed work on earthworms==
From his brain-storming about transmutation towards the end of 1838, Darwin conceived of his theory of [[natural selection]] "by which to work", as his "prime hobby". His main work on the ''Beagle'' collections continued, and in 1842 he published the first of three volumes on geology, ''[[The Structure and Distribution of Coral Reefs]]''. He then allowed himself to write out the first "pencil sketch" of his theory. Subsequently, in September 1842, the family moved to rural [[Down House]] where he had space for experimental plant and animal breeding, and surroundings to observe nature.&lt;ref name=vw/&gt; In December of that year he had a quantity of broken chalk spread over a part of a long established pasture field near the house, "for the sake of observing at some future period to what depth it would become buried."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Darwin|1881|p=[http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?viewtype=text&amp;itemID=F1357&amp;pageseq=154 139]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1872 he was having disagreements with [[St George Mivart]] about ''[[The Descent of Man]]''.{{Citation needed|date=August 2012}} Darwin cut communication with Mivart {{Citation needed|date=August 2012}} and went the less controversial direction of the lowly worm. His network of [[correspondence of Charles Darwin|correspondents]] and fans responded to his interest and "earthworm anecdotes began surfacing in his mountain of mail". He had been interested in earthworms "since his first fishing days at The Mount and flirting days at Maer". Still, other work constrained him. Broken off from ''Descent'', he had to finish his next work ''[[The Expression of the Emotions in Man and Animals]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Desmond|Moore|1991|p= 592}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Stonehenge 1877.JPG|left|thumb|His research included a railway trip to [[Stonehenge]]]]
By 1876, with his [[Bernard Darwin|first grandson]] on the way, he felt his writing life was nearly over, with so much unfinished. He wanted to write on earthworms "before joining them", but also had two more plant books in mind, and a revision of ''[[Fertilisation of Orchids]]'' to work on. He also began an [[The Autobiography of Charles Darwin|autobiographical work]] intended for his family's eyes only.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Desmond|Moore|1991|p= 622}}&lt;/ref&gt; After turning away a request to support a controversial book on contraception (''[[Fruits of Philosophy]]'') – Darwin was opposed to it – he got back to work on flowers and worms. As with much of his geological and [[evolution]]ary work, worms were a case of [[gradualism|gradual]], barely noticeable changes accumulating over time into large effects. He even went on a two-hour excursion to [[Stonehenge]] to see how its monoliths had been buried by earthworm castings.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Desmond|Moore|1991|p= 628}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He was occupied by worms at [[Downe]] in 1880, his work coming first. He had help from the family, even receiving soil samples from [[Abinger]]'s Roman ruins.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Desmond|Moore|1991|p= 643}}&lt;/ref&gt; He told Vladimir Kovalevsky (his Russian translator) of slow progress with his new book.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Desmond|Moore|1991|p= 648}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Earthworm klitellum copulation beentree.jpg|thumb|Earthworms mate in daylight, but are generally [[nocturnal]] above ground.]]
Darwin calculated that there were 53,767 earthworms recycling away per acre. He carried out experiments indoors, where they worked the earth inside pots in a worm-littered room. He experimented with stimuli at night: strong light would send them into their burrows ("like a rabbit" said Darwin's grandson Bernard), but heat and sound had no effect. Their food preferences were also tested, raw carrots being their favourite.&lt;ref name="Moore1991"&gt;{{Harvnb|Desmond|Moore|1991|p= 649}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Darwin restored2.jpg|left|thumb|150px|A photograph of Darwin around the time the book was published.]]
Darwin was fascinated by their [[ethology|behaviour]], from enjoying "the pleasure of eating" (based on their eagerness for certain foods) to their [[mating|sexual passions]], "strong enough to overcome... their dread of light", even to their social feelings ("crawling over each other's bodies").&lt;ref name="Moore1991a"&gt;{{Harvnb|Desmond|Moore|1991|p= 650}}&lt;/ref&gt; Their [[foraging]] was especially intriguing: they dragged leaves into their burrows, pulling them in the most efficient way, by their pointed end. On these semi-intelligent creatures Darwin wrote that they obtained a "notion, however rude, of the shape of an object", perhaps by feeling it out. Worms, "five or six feet" below the ground ploughed farmers fields. Darwin felt we "ought to be grateful" to these little recyclers, which he compared to "a man... born blind and deaf". He was wondering how long it would be until he would be consumed by worms himself{{Citation needed|date=November 2011}}. It would surely be his last major work; he told German translator [[Julius Victor Carus|Victor Carus]] "I have little strength &amp; feel very old".&lt;ref name="Moore1991" /&gt;

By 1881 he was unable to summon the strength for revisions and handed ''Worms'' on to [[Francis Darwin|Frank]]. His [[illness of Charles Darwin|health]] gave him troubles; he complained to his long-time friend [[Joseph Dalton Hooker|Hooker]] that he looked forward to "Down graveyard as the sweetest place on earth."&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Desmond|Moore|1991|p= 652}}&lt;/ref&gt; Concerned about the book he had been anticipating for decades, he hurried his publisher [[John Murray (publisher)|John Murray]] to hasten publication of ''Worms'' even at the risk of not making a profit.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Desmond|Moore|1991|p= 654}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At a dinner with [[Edward Aveling]] (soon the son-in-law of [[Karl Marx]]) and other [[atheist]]s, he was asked how he had turned to such an "insignificant" subject as worms, to which he replied "I have been studying their habits for forty years." As with his [[Charles Darwin's views on religion|religious views]], the old naturalist did not see things the same way as Aveling. In Darwin's view, the "insignificant" was the foundation of much greater phenomena.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Desmond|Moore|1991|p= 657}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Summary==
[[File:Darwin. Earthworm, Fig. 4B.JPG|thumb|A casting from the Nilgiri Mountains in South India]]
Worms are found in many places, from the forest floor to mountains, and in many locations around the world. Though they are considered terrestrial animals, they are really semi-aquatic, like other [[annelid]]s; they die quickly in air but survive for months in water. Though inactive during the day, they sometimes come out of their burrows at night. They are eaten by [[thrush (bird)|thrush]]es and other birds in large numbers because they lie close to the surface. They have well developed muscular, nervous, circulatory and digestive systems, the latter being quite unique. Though eyeless, they respond to the intensity and duration of light. They also slowly respond to temperature. They have no hearing, but are sensitive to vibrations. Their sense of smell is feeble, but they are able to find their preferred foods. [[Omnivorous]] animals, they swallow much earth and extract food from it. Worms live chiefly on half decayed [[leaf|leaves]], partially digested by a [[Pancreatic juice|pancreatic solution]] before ingestion. This extra-stomachal digestion is not unlike that which Darwin had previously described as occurring in [[Insectivorous Plants (book)|''Insectivorous Plants'']]. The structure and physiology of the [[Oligochaeta#Internal anatomy|calciferous glands]] of earthworms are described. Many hypotheses had been advanced for their function; Darwin believed them to be primarily for [[excretion]] and secondarily a [[digestion]] aid.

Thin leaves are seized with the mouth, while thick ones are dragged by creating a vacuum. Leaves and stones are used to plug up the burrow. This may deter predators, keep out water and/or keep out chilled air (the latter is Darwin's preferred function). Leaves are dragged in mostly by the tips, which is the easiest way of doing it, but when the base is narrower the worms change behaviour. They drag [[pine needle]] clusters in by the base. [[Petiole (botany)|Petiole]]s are used to plug up burrows, and for food. Worms drag experimental triangles of paper by the apex most of the time, and do not rely on [[trial and error]]. Worms excavate burrows by consuming material or, preferably, pushing it away. They mainly consume [[soil]] for nutrients. They are found down to six or more feet, especially in extreme conditions. Burrows are lined, which serve several functions, and terminate in a chamber lined with stones or seeds. Worms are found all over the planet, some on isolated islands; how they got there is a mystery. Darwin draws on correspondence with people from around the world such as [[Fritz Müller]] in Brazil.

[[File:Darwin, Earthworm, Fig.  7.JPG|thumb|Figure from the book showing a sunken stone from Stonehenge]]
The amount of earth brought to the surface by worms can be estimated by the rate at which objects on the surface are buried and by weighing the earth brought up in a given time. Information from farmers on marl, cinders etc. sinking into the ground allowed Darwin to make calculations. He conducted a 29-year experiment on chalk at a field near his house. Objects of all sorts "work themselves downards" as farmers say. Large stones sink because worms fill up any hollows with castings, then eject them beyond the perimeter and the ground around them starts to rise. He visited [[Stonehenge]] and found some outer stones partly buried, the turf sloping up to meet them (see figure 7). Darwin weighed castings and had friends do so in other countries. He also weighed castings per unit area per year, then worked out how thick a layer castings would make, compared with rates of sinking. Additionally, he worked out casting weight per worm per year.

[[File:Darwins Wurmstein im Gras, Naturhistorisches Museum Wien.jpg|thumb|Darwin's experiments included measuring the speed with which stones slowly settle into the earth.]]
Worms have preserved many ancient objects under the ground. Darwin describes an ancient [[Roman villa]] in [[Abinger]], Surrey. Worms have penetrated the concrete walls and even mortar. Similar subsidence occurred at [[Beaulieu Abbey]], Hampshire, with worms penetrating gaps between the tiles. His sons [[Francis Darwin|Francis]] and [[Horace Darwin|Horace]] visited [[Chedworth Roman Villa]] in Gloucestershire, while William reported on [[Brading Roman Villa]], Isle of Wight. Darwin goes into some detail on the well preserved ruins of [[Calleva Atrebatum|Silchester Roman Town]], Hampshire, with the help of the Rev. J. G. Joyce. Finally he discusses the case of the [[Viroconium Cornoviorum|Viroconium]] Roman town ruins at [[Wroxeter]], Shropshire, with the help of Dr. H. Johnson, who made observations including depth of vegetable mould. He concludes that both worms and other causes, such as dust deposition and washing down of soil, have buried such ruins.

[[Denudation]] (removal of matter to a lower level) is caused mainly by air and water movement. [[Humic acid]]s generated by worms disintegrate rock; their burrowing behaviour speeds this up. But as the soil layer thickens, this process is slowed down. Worms swallow hard objects (e.g. stones) to aid digestion, which causes attrition to such objects. This has geological significance, especially for the smaller particles which otherwise are eroded very slowly.

Rain causes castings to move down an incline; Darwin worked out the weight moving a certain distance in a given time. Some also roll down, and collect in drains etc., or get blown. There is a greater effect on casting movement in the tropics, because of increased rain. The finest earth is washed away. Ledges on hillsides, formerly believed to be caused by grazing mammals, are partly due to casting accumulations. High winds, especially gales, are almost as effective as the slope/rain in moving castings. Crowns and furrows of formerly ploughed lands slowly vanish when under [[pasture]], due to worms, but more slowly when there is no incline. Fine earth is washed down from slopes, making a shallow layer. Dissolving of chalk supplies new earth.

Darwin writes in the conclusion that worms "have played a more important part in the history of the world than most persons would at first suppose."&lt;ref&gt;p. 305&lt;/ref&gt; They are important for many reasons, including their role in decomposition of rocks, gradual denudation of the land, preservation of archaeological remains, and improving soil conditions for plant growth. Despite their rudimentary sense organs, they show complex, flexible behaviour.

==Reception==
[[File:Man is But a Worm.jpg|thumb|"Man is but a worm" caricature published in ''[[Punch (magazine)|Punch]]'' at the end of 1881 ]]

'''Toxic units (TU)''' are used in the field of toxicology to quantify the interactions of [[toxicant]]s in binary mixtures of chemicals. A toxic unit for a given compound is based on the concentration at which there is a 50% effect (ex. [[EC50]]) for a certain biological endpoint. One toxic unit is equal to the EC50 for a given endpoint for a specific biological effect over a given amount of time. Toxic units allow for the comparison of the individual toxicities of a binary mixture to the combined toxicity. This allows researchers to categorize mixtures as additive, synergistic or antagonistic.  Synergism and antagonism are defined by mixtures that are more or less toxic than predicted by the sum of their toxic units.

[[Contamination|Contaminants]] are frequently present as mixtures in the environment. Regulatory decisions are based on mixture toxicity models that assume additivity, which can result in under or overestimation of toxic effects. Refining our understanding of mixture interactions can lead to better informed environmental management and decision making. In addition, exploring mixture interactions can elucidate the mechanisms of action for specific toxicants which, in many cases, are poorly understood.

== Methods ==
Application of toxic units requires toxicity data for the individual components of the mixture as well as specialized mixture toxicity data. Evaluating the response of each individual chemical allows researchers to generate a new dosing metric, toxic units, which is standardized to the toxicity of each chemical. Since the toxicity of two compounds may vary widely, 1 toxic unit of two different compounds could correspond to two very different concentrations on a per mass basis. In addition to the toxicity of the individual components, use of toxic units requires a 2x2 factorial design concentration series where the response is measured to an increase of each contaminant with the other contaminant held constant. This elaborate concentration series allows researchers to describe how the mixture components interact with each other and predict effects at untested combinations components with nonlinear regression models.

=== Point estimates ===
[[File:Concentration-response curve.jpg|thumb|Example of concentration-response model used to calculate EC50. Toxciant concentration is on the X-axis and biological response is on the Y-axis.]]
[[Point estimation]] is a technique to predict population parameters based on available sample data and can be used to relate the mass based concentration to a toxicity based metric. Point estimates in toxicology are frequently response endpoints on a [[Dose–response relationship|dose response curve]]. These point estimates predict at what concentration one would expect to see a given biological endpoint like 50% mortality ([[LC50]]). Any toxicological endpoint (growth inhibition, reproduction, behavior etc.) can be used as the toxicity metric to convert from mass based concentration to toxic units.

Point estimates are generated by fitting a [[nonlinear regression]] model to toxicity data and using that model to predict the concentration of chemical required to elicit a known response of the biological endpoint.

=== Equation and calculations ===
One Toxic unit can be defined by the researcher as the concentration of a given chemical required to cause a given toxicological endpoint ([[LC50]], [[EC50]], [[IC50]]).

ex. 1TU=LC50 or 1TU=IC50 for inhibition of growth

Since the mass or molar based concentrations of different chemicals required to cause a given endpoint like an LC50 may vary widely, the concentration that corresponds to 1TU is specific to each individual chemical tested.

=== Isobolograms ===

Isobolograms are one way to present the results of binary mixture toxicity testing based in toxic units.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;Warne MSJ. 2003. A Review of the Ecotoxicity of Mixtures, Approaches to and Recommendations for, their Management. Proceedings of the Fifth National Workshop on the Assessment of Site Contamination. EPHC. pp.256&lt;/ref&gt; The strength of this method is it's simplicity and ease of use. First a line of additivity is plotted that corresponds to all the combinations of the two chemicals that would result in one toxic unit. Next the experimental results from binary mixture tests are plotted on the isobologram. The results from the mixture test are point estimates from the mixture dose response curves that correspond to the single chemical tests. When these mixture point estimates are plotted on the isobologram, the region that they fall into (based on the concentrations of the two chemicals required to cause that given endpoint) demonstrates whether the mixture interactions are [[Interaction#Biochemistry|additive]], [[Synergy#Drug synergy|synergistic]] or [[Antagonism (chemistry)|antagonistic]].

===Response surfaces===
[[File:F(x,y)=−((cosx)^2 + (cosy)^2)^2.PNG|thumb|Three dimensional graph depicting the function F(x,y) where x and y could be the concentration of the individual components in toxic units and the height of the graph depicts the toxicological response.]]Response surfaces are a more advanced and complex way to visualize the same information presented in an isobologram. A response surface is a three dimensional graph with concentrations of individual components in toxic units on the x and y axis and the response variable on the z axis. This three dimensional representation of the organisms response to the two chemical stressors can be used to predict the toxicity of any combination of the components based on the nonlinear regression models that form the response surface.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Antagonistic, additive, and synergistic effects ===
The primary utility of toxic units is to classify mixture interactions as additive, synergistic or antagonistic. Additivity means that the toxicity of the mixture is equal to the sum of the toxicities of the individual components. Additivity is the default assumption of models used to predict toxicity of mixtures for regulatory and environmental management purposes. Synergistic effects occur when the experimental toxicity of the mixture is greater than the sum of the individual toxicities. Conversely, antagonistic effects occur when the experimental toxicity of a mixture is less than would be predicted by additivity. Understanding mixture interactions can prevent over or underestimation of toxicity by regulators who assume additivity for uncategorized mixtures.

== Applications ==

=== Equilibrium partitioning sediment benchmarks ===
The [[United States Environmental Protection Agency|U.S. EPA]] uses toxic units as a benchmark, called the [[Equilibrium partitioning sediment benchmarks|equilibrium partitioning sediment benchmark (ESB)]], for predicting the toxicity of [[polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon]] (PAH)-contaminated sediments to benthic invertebrates.&lt;ref&gt;U.S. Environmental Protection Agency. 2003. Procedures for the derivation of ESBs for the protection of benthic organisms: PAH mixtures. EPA/600/R-02/013. Office of Research and Development, Washington, DC.&lt;/ref&gt; Toxic units are calculated from sediment concentrations of 34 PAHs and their expected sediment, water, and lipid partitioning behavior. Based on the equilibrium partitioning approach (which accounts for the varying biological availability of chemicals in different sediments), the ESB for total PAH is the sum of the quotients of a minimum of each of the 34 individual PAHs in a specific sediment, divided by the final chronic value concentration for each specific PAH in sediment. According to the U.S. EPA, freshwater or saltwater sediments that contain less or equal to 1.0 toxic units of the mixture of the 34 PAHs or more PAHs are acceptable for the protection of benthic organisms. Sediments that are greater than 1.0 toxic units are not protective and potentially have adverse effects to benthic organisms.

U.S. EPA ESBs do not consider antagonistic, additive, or synergistic effects of other sediment contaminants and have been criticized as an overly conservative estimate for pyrogenic PAHs (such as those from manufactured gas plant processes).&lt;ref&gt;Hawthorne SB, DJ Miller, and JP Kreitinger. 2006. Measurement of total polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon concentrations in sediments and toxic units used for estimating risk to benthic invertebrates at manufactured gas plant sites. ''Environmental Toxicology and Chemistry'' 25(1):287-296&lt;/ref&gt; This is in part due to the analytical approaches for determining the toxic units for both pyrogenic and petrogenic PAHs.

=== Toxicity identification evaluation ===
The toxicity identification evaluation (TIE) is an approach to systematically characterize, identify, and confirm toxic substances in whole sediments and sediment interstitial waters.&lt;ref&gt;Burgess RM and KT Ho. Sediment Toxicity Identification Evaluation. Chapter S, Ferard and Blaise (ed.), Encyclopedia of Aquatic Ecotoxicology. Springer, New York, NY, 8/13/2013:online, (2013).&lt;/ref&gt; This approach is typically carried out by the U.S. EPA. The effluent effect concentration data and the measured toxicant concentration data are transformed to toxic units for the regression analysis to evaluate whether a linear relationship exists between two or more toxicants.&lt;ref&gt;U.S. Environmental Protection Agency. 1993. Methods for Aquatic Toxicity Identification Evaluations: Phase III Toxicity Confirmation Procedures for Samples Exhibiting Acute and Chronic Toxicity. EPA/600/R-92/081. Office of Research and Development, Washington, DC.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Limitations ==
The limitations associated with using Toxic Units are largely dependent on the methodology in which they are being used. For example, the use of isobolograms is applicable to only binary mixtures. In general, Toxic Units are based on point estimates which are limited by projection. Point estimates, and therefore Toxic Units, are a simplification of a [[Dose–response relationship|dose-response model]]. Information about toxic effects at concentrations other than the point estimate are lost in translation.

=== Alternative ways to study mixtures ===

==== Top-down Approach ====
A common method for studying mixtures is to measure the total toxicity of the mixture and consider the internal toxicant interactions as irrelevant.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Any mixture effects are taken into account in the total toxicity. The results for this method are limited by being mixture specific and has limited value in determining specific mechanisms of toxicity.

==== GLM Approach ====
Using [[Generalized linear model|Generalized Linear Models (GLM)]] allows for complex, non-parametric model fitting to describe the toxicity complex mixtures. Generalized Linear Models are more likely to find significant differences from additivity than TU approaches.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/37981637|title=Fundamentals of ecotoxicology|last=C.|first=Newman, Michael|date=1998|publisher=Ann Arbor Press|isbn=1575040131|oclc=37981637}}&lt;/ref&gt; The GLM approach also allows for the alteration of models to reflect current knowledge of biological mechanisms&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Complex Mixtures: Methods for In Vivo Toxicity Testing|last=National Research Council (US) Committee on Methods for the In Vivo Toxicity Testing of Complex Mixtures|first=|publisher=National Academies Press (US)|year=1998|isbn=|location=Washington DC|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''vertical ecosystem''' is an architectural gardening system developed by [[Ignacio Solano]] from the [[Green wall|mur vegetalise]] created by [[Patrick Blanc]]. This new approach enhances the previous archetype of mur vegetal and considers the relationship that exists between a set of living organisms, [[biocenosis]], inhabiting a physical component, [[biotope]]. The system is based on the automated control of nutrients and plant parameters of the original wall, adding strains of bacteria, [[mycorrhiza]]l fungi and interspecific [[symbiosis]] in plant selection, creating an artificial [[ecosystem]] from inert substrates. The system was created in 2007 and patented in 2010.&lt;ref&gt;''[http://patentados.com/patente/sistema-para-el-ajardinado-de-fachadas/ Patent briefing]&lt;/ref&gt;

Amongst [[abiotic]] factors that influence vertical ecosystems, namely the substrate and its environmental conditions, the physio-chemical characteristics possessed by the means are decisive.&lt;ref&gt;''[http://www.branz.co.nz/cms_show_download.php?id=20daaf800a4be3f8fcb33d5d1746e622a875e0c5 Clara Gerhardt and Brenda Vale (2010). ''Comparison of resource use and environmental performance of [[green wall]]s with façade greenings and extensive [[green roof]]s.''Victoria University of Wellington: School of Architecture.]&lt;/ref&gt;  The texture, porosity and depth of the substrate, those that in a natural ecosystem are [[edaphic]] factors, have been tested to the point of finding fitogenerate{{what|date=May 2018}} materials with perfect levels of absorption and humidity for the development of more than forty living families of plants represented by around 120 species. Moreover, the substrate used in the system developed by Ignacio Solano provides the ecosystem with the necessary resistance to serve as a high-durability [[biotope]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Luttge.U, Kluge.M, Bauer G.|year=1993|title=Botánica|pages=455}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Environmental factor]]s such as light, temperature and humidity are controlled by automated systems in interior vertical ecosystems.  Ecosystems that are situated outside require study and analysis of the natural variables of their particular area, combined with a study of the behaviour of the numerous plant species in the biotope in each location. The selection and combination of species is one of the key factors for correct development. This is known as positive [[allelopathy]].

[[Hydrological]] factors, such as pH levels, the conductivity of the water, dissolved gases and salinity, are balanced with precision so that the [[hydroponic]] system functions at its maximum capacity. The objective required by this system is to incorporate all the nutrients and [[micronutrient]]s necessary for the health of the plants, and therefore the whole ecosystem, in a constant manner. To control these variables, the vertical ecosystem implements a system of sensors and warnings that inform of any anomaly of measurements in real time, allowing remote monitoring and control of the system.&lt;ref&gt;''[http://www.diarioinformacion.com/alicante/2011/05/29/habichuelas-magicas-siglo-xxi/1132484.html Diario La información, Las habichuelas mágicas del siglo XXI, 2011]&lt;/ref&gt;

Vertical ecosystems enable plant species, fungi, and bacteria to live in an environment of almost unlimited resources, generating interactions favourable to the system.&lt;ref&gt;''[http://www.diariovasco.com/agencias/20120523/mas-actualidad/sociedad/patenta-coctel-bacterias-para-alargar_201205231647.html Diario Vasco, Patenta un cóctel de bacterias para alargar la vida de los jardines verticales, 2012]&lt;/ref&gt;  In this way, they encourage healthy and exponential growth in their evolutionary stages, until they manage to adjust to their maximum value, known as the load capacity: the optimum capacity of living species interacting without stress in a limited space in search of [[mutualism (biology)|mutualism]]s and intraspecific associations that benefit all the species involved. The success of a vertical ecosystem depends on the control of abiotic and biotic factors that limit the growth of plant populations, the control of ''environmental resistance''.

Vertical ecosystems aim to prolong the life of planted species and bring the benefits of a traditional vertical garden, including: [[carbon capture|absorption of CO2]], heavy metals and dust, natural [[thermal insulation]], and reduction of [[noise pollution]].

In fall of 2018, a CBS News investigation of Woz U cast some doubts on the professionalism of the expensive curriculum. CBS interviewed two dozen current and former students and employees, who shared their dissatisfaction with the content quality, such as documentation typos leading to confusing program errors, while some promised live lectures were actually recorded and out-of-date. One student described the 33-week online program as "a $13,000 e-book". A former "enrollment counselor" described a high-pressure sales environment, which the company denied. In a prepared statement, Woz U president Chris Coleman admitted the documentation errors and said quality control efforts were being implemented, and said curriculum was reviewed by Wozniak.
