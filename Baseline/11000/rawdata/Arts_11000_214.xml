His pageant shield leans against the tree. The Queen's "favour", a glove, is attached to his hat.]]
The '''Accession Day tilts''' were a series of elaborate festivities held annually at the court of [[Elizabeth I of England]] to celebrate her [[Accession Day]], 17&amp;nbsp;November, also known as Queen's Day.&lt;ref&gt;which was elevated into a [[Protestant]] [[feast day]] by adding it to the [[Anglican]] [[Church calendar]]: "All over England the Queen's subjects expressed their joy in her Government by prayers and sermons, bell-ringing, bonfires and feasting", notes Roy C. Strong, "The Popular Celebration of the Accession Day of Queen Elizabeth I" ''Journal of the Warburg and Courtauld Institutes'' '''21'''.1/2 (January 1958:86-103) p 87; see also, whereon sttod a [[Lion and Unicorn|lyon and a dragon]], supporters Strong (1984):19 and Hutton 1994:146-151&lt;/ref&gt;  The tilts combined [[theatre|theatrical]] elements with [[jousting]], in which Elizabeth's [[courtier]]s competed to outdo each other in [[allegory|allegorical]] [[armour]] and [[costume]], [[poetry]], and [[Medieval pageant|pageant]]ry to exalt the queen and her realm of [[England]].&lt;ref name="A"&gt;Strong 1977, p. 129-133&lt;/ref&gt;

The last Elizabethan Accession Day tilt was held in November 1602; the queen died the following spring.  Tilts continued as part of festivities marking the Accession Day of [[James I of England|James I]], 24&amp;nbsp;March, until 1624, the year before his death.&lt;ref&gt;Strong (1987):137-138; Young, p. 208&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origins==
[[File:Henryleegarniture.jpg|thumb|left|The Greenwich garniture of [[Sir Henry Lee]], in the Jacob Album]]
Sir [[Henry Lee of Ditchley]], [[Queen's Champion]], devised the Accession Day tilts, which became the most important [[Elizabethan era|Elizabethan]] court festival from the 1580s.&lt;ref&gt;Festivities surrounding installations of the [[Order of the Garter]] were less frequent, less elaborate and less public.&lt;/ref&gt; The celebrations are likely to have begun somewhat informally in the early 1570s.&lt;ref name="A" /&gt; By 1581, the Queen's Day tilts "had been deliberately developed into a gigantic public spectacle eclipsing every other form of court festival", with thousands in attendance; the public were admitted for a small charge.&lt;ref&gt;Strong 1977, p. 133, &amp; 1984:51&lt;/ref&gt;  Lee himself oversaw the annual festivities until he retired as Queen's Champion at the tilt of 1590, handing over the role to [[George Clifford, 3rd Earl of Cumberland]].&lt;ref&gt;The ceremonial transfer is described in detail in Yates, p. 102-103&lt;/ref&gt;  Following Lee's retirement, orchestration of the tilts fell to the [[Edward Somerset, 4th Earl of Worcester|Earl of Worcester]] in his capacity of [[Master of Horse]] and to the queen's [[favourite]], the [[Robert Devereux, 2nd Earl of Essex|Earl of Essex]], although Lee remained as a sort of Master of Ceremonies at the request of the queen.&lt;ref&gt;Yates, p. 104&lt;/ref&gt;

The pageants were held at the [[tiltyard]] at the [[Palace of Whitehall]],&lt;ref&gt;except in 1593, when they were relocated to the grounds of [[Windsor Castle]] due to an outbreak of [[Plague (disease)|plague]] in [[London]]; see Young, p. 122, 169.&lt;/ref&gt; where the royal party viewed the festivities from the Tiltyard Gallery.  The [[Office of Works]] constructed a platform with staircases below the gallery to facilitate presentations to the queen.&lt;ref&gt;Young, p. 119-122&lt;/ref&gt;

==Participants==
[[Image:Devereaux essex4.jpg|left|thumb|[[Robert Devereux, 2nd Earl of Essex]] in "sable sad" armour, probably for the Tilt of 1590,&lt;ref&gt;Young p. 136&lt;/ref&gt; by [[William Segar]].]]

===Knights===
Tilt lists for the Accession Day pageants have survived; these establish that the majority of the participating jousters came from the ranks of the Queen's [[Gentlemen Pensioners]].  Entrants included such powerful members of the court as the [[Francis Russell, 2nd Earl of Bedford|Earl of Bedford]], the [[Edward de Vere, 17th Earl of Oxford|Earl of Oxford]], the [[Henry Wriothesley, 3rd Earl of Southampton|Earl of Southampton]], Lord [[Charles Howard, 1st Earl of Nottingham|Howard of Effingham]],&lt;ref name="B" /&gt; and the Earl of Essex.&lt;ref name="Hutton"&gt;Hutton 1994, p. 146-151&lt;/ref&gt; Many of those participating had seen active service in Ireland or on the Continent, but the atmosphere of romance and entertainment seems to have predominated over the serious military exercises that were medieval tournaments.&lt;ref&gt;Strong (1984):51&lt;/ref&gt; [[Sir James Scudamore]], a knight who tilted in the 1595 tournament, was immortalized as "Sir Scudamour" in Book Four of ''[[The Faerie Queene]]'' by [[Edmund Spenser]].
[[File:Scudamorehelmet.jpg|thumb|[[Greenwich armour]] of [[Sir James Scudamore]], 1590s. Jousting was crucial to Scudamore's reputation at court.&lt;ref&gt;The armet shown was made by restorer Daniel Tachaux in 1915 to replace the missing original, and faithfully reproduces the style's distinctive high visor.&lt;/ref&gt;]]

Knights participating in the spectacle entered in pageant cars or on horseback, disguised as some heroic, romantic, or [[metaphor]]ical figure, with their servants in [[fancy dress]] according to the theme of the entry.  A squire presented a [[Card stock|pasteboard]] pageant shield decorated with the character's [[Personal device|device]] or ''impresa'' to the Queen and explained the significance of his disguise in prose or poetry.&lt;ref name="B"&gt;Strong 1977, p. 135&lt;/ref&gt;  Entrants went to considerable expense to devise themes, order armour and costumes for their followers, and in some cases to hire poets or dramatists and even professional actors to carry out their programmes.  

Classical, [[pastoral]], and [[King Arthur|Arthurian]] settings were typically combined with story lines flattering to the queen, but serious subtexts were common, especially among those who used these occasions to express public contrition or desolation for having aroused the queen's displeasure, or to plead for royal favour.&lt;ref&gt;Young, p. 167-77&lt;/ref&gt; In the painting on the left, Essex wears black (sable) armour, which he wore as part of his 1590 entrance to the tilts.  At this particular tilt, Essex entered as the head of a funeral procession, carried on a bier by his attendants.  This was meant to atone for his failure to subdue Ireland, but Elizabeth was not impressed and did not forgive him readily.

===Poets===
Poets associated with court circles who wrote allegorical verses to accompany the knights' presentations include [[John Davies (poet)|John Davies]], [[Edward de Vere]], [[Philip Sidney]]&lt;ref&gt;'Two Songs for an Accession Day Tilt', in ''Sir Philip Sidney: The Major Works'', Oxford University Press, 2002, {{ISBN|0-19-284080-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the young [[Francis Bacon]], who composed speeches and helped stage presentations for his [[patron]], the Earl of Essex.&lt;ref&gt;'A Conference of Pleasure' (speeches composed for the Earl of Essex for the Queen’s Accession Day Tilt, 1594): 'In Praise of Knowledge', 'In Praise of Fortitude', 'In Praise of Love', 'In Praise of Truth'; 'The Device of the Indian Prince' (Speeches composed for the Earl of Essex for the Queen’s Accession Day Tilt, 1594): 'Squire', 'Hermit', 'Soldier', 'Statesman'.   [http://www.fbrt.org.uk/pages/essays/essay-dates.html Dates of Francis Bacon's works, retrieved 29 November 2007] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071011022037/http://www.fbrt.org.uk/pages/essays/essay-dates.html |date=October 11, 2007 }}; and see Strong (1987), p. 137&lt;/ref&gt;  Sidney, in particular, as both poet and knight, embodied the [[chivalry|chivalric]] themes of the tilts; a remembrance of Sidney was part of the tilt programme of 1586, the year after his death.&lt;ref&gt;Yates, p.100&lt;/ref&gt; Sidney's friend and protégé [[Sir James Scudamore]], who would go on to be one of the primary competitors in the Accession Day tilt in 1595, carried the pennant of Sidney's arms at the age of eighteen.&lt;ref&gt;Atherton, Ian. Ambition and Failure in Stuart England: The Career of John, First Viscount Scudamore, Manchester University Press, 1999. p.34&lt;/ref&gt; [[Edmund Spenser]] wrote of ''[[The Faerie Queene]]'', which turns upon the Accession Day festivities as its fundamental structural device: "I devise that the Faery Queen kept her Annuall feast xii. days, upon which xii. severall days, the occasions of the xii. severall adventures hapned&lt;!--hapned in original--&gt;, which being undertaken by xii. severall knights, are in these xii. books severally handled and discoursed";&lt;ref&gt;Letter from Spenser to [[Sir Walter Raleigh]] quoted in Roy C. Strong 1958:86.&lt;/ref&gt;

==A visitor's account==
[[File:Armor Garniture of George Clifford (1558–1605), Third Earl of Cumberland MET DP295743.jpg|thumb|[[Greenwich armour]] of [[George Clifford, 3rd Earl of Cumberland]] (1558–1605), 1586.  This has a different design to that in the miniature by [[Nicholas Hilliard]] (at top).]]
The fullest straightforward account of a Tilt is by Lupold von Wedel, a German traveller who saw the 1584 celebrations:
&lt;blockquote&gt;Now approached the day, when on November 17 the tournament was to be held... About twelve o’clock the queen and her ladies placed themselves at the windows in a long room at Weithol [Whitehall] palace, near Westminster, opposite the barrier where the tournament was to be held. From this room a broad staircase led downwards, and round the barrier stands were arranged by boards above the ground, so that everybody by paying 12d. would get a stand and see the play... Many thousand spectators, men, women and girls, got places, not to speak of those who were within the barrier and paid nothing.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;During the whole time of the tournament all those who wished to fight entered the list by pairs, the trumpets being blown at the time and other musical instruments. The combatants had their servants clad in different colours, they, however, did not enter the barrier, but arranged themselves on both sides. Some of the servants were disguised like savages, or like Irishmen, with the hair hanging down to the girdle like women, others had horses equipped like elephants, some carriages were drawn by men, others appeared to move by themselves; altogether the carriages were very odd in appearance. Some gentlemen had their horses with them and mounted in full armour directly from the carriage. There were some who showed very good horsemanship and were also in fine attire. The manner of the combat each had settled before entering the lists. The costs amounted to several thousand pounds each.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;When a gentleman with his servants approached the barrier, on horseback or in a carriage, he stopped at the foot of the staircase leading to the queen’s room, while one of his servants in pompous attire of a special pattern mounted the steps and addressed the queen in well-composed verses or with a ludicrous speech, making her and her ladies laugh. When the speech was ended he in the name of his lord offered to the queen a costly present.. .Now always two by two rode against each other, breaking lances across the beam.. . The fête lasted until five o’clock in the afternoon...&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.shafe.co.uk/art/Tudor_13_-_Tournaments_and_Royal_Progresses.asp SHAFE] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081203170842/http://www.shafe.co.uk/art/Tudor_13_-_Tournaments_and_Royal_Progresses.asp |date=December 3, 2008 }} Transactions of the Royal Historical Society, New Series IX (1895)pp. 258-9, quoted Strong, 1984, Yates ''Astrea'' etc&lt;/ref&gt;  &lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Plot==
Raymond Ding, a middle-aged [[Chinese American]] college professor, and Aurora Crane, his younger ''[[Hapa]]'' (half-Asian) girlfriend, have just split, but continue to drift in and out of each other's lives. Unable to fully let go, Raymond visits the apartment they once shared, during the day while Aurora is away. Aurora is haunted by flashbacks of moments from their relationship.

Encouraged by their best friends to move on, Raymond and Aurora each begin new relationships.  Aurora dates Steve, a [[Caucasian race|Caucasian]] man closer to her age (and also her best friend's ex).  Raymond dates Betty, a [[Vietnamese American]] colleague, who he soon discovers is haunted by her own past. Race and identity issues begin to surface as Raymond and Aurora try to start new lives, but remain drawn to their past.

==Critical reception==
''Americanese'' was met with generally positive reviews. The film has a score of 67% with a certified "Fresh" rating on [[Rotten Tomatoes]] based on 9 reviews.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/americanese/|title=Americanese|publisher=[[Rotten Tomatoes]]|accessdate=March 25, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Acclaimed film critic [[Roger Ebert]] from the ''[[Chicago Sun-Times]]'' awarded the film 3 1/2 out of 4 stars and wrote of the film, saying "Byler deals with characters who have lived their years, learned from them, and try to apply their values to their lives. Their romances are not heedless but wary, and involve a lot of negotiation," and finished by calling the film "...uncommonly absorbing."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Ebert|first=Roger|title=Americanese|url=http://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/americanese-2006|publisher=Roger Ebert.com|accessdate=25 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Kevin Crust of the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' in his review stated that ''Americanese'' had "fine, understated performances and the self-assured way that Byler lets the film find its own rhythms, rather than setting into some template, result in a mature film of subtle complexity".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Crust|first=Kevin|title=A modern love story|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2006/may/11/news/wk-screen11|publisher=Los Angeles Times|accessdate=25 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2536">'''ArtSpan''' is a [[San Francisco]], [[California]], nonprofit organization that produces the oldest and largest artist open studios event in the [[United States]]. Started in 1975, ArtSpan’s San Francisco Open Studios (SFOS) takes place over five weekends in October and November each year with a different city district highlighted each weekend. The Open Studios take place in a myriad of different locations within each district. Some are in art galleries, some in apartments, some in garages and some in store fronts. Local publications often make recommendations for each weekend. In 2018, over 800 local artists participated in SFOS.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://missionlocal.org/2015/11/40th-annual-artspan-open-studios-this-weekend/|title=40th Annual ArtSpan Open Studios Is This Weekend in SF Mission|last=Waxmann|first=Laura|date=Nov 6, 2015|work=Mission Local|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

While many of the artists’s works can be found in galleries during the year,  Open Studios gives the public the opportunity to meet the artists, see a much broader representation of the artists’s work than can be seen in any other exhibit short of a retrospective and to buy original art work without gallery markups.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.7x7.com/homes-of-artist-colllectors-sf-2606926044.html|title=Artists Who Collect: Inside the SF Homes of Obsessive Creatives|last=Volpicelli|first=Anna|date=October 2008|work=7x7 Magazine |access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Artspan also hosts the San Francisco Open Studios Exhibition that includes works from over 400 Open Studio artists organized by the districts the artists are showing in. Each year select gallery curators are tasked with choosing one work to celebrate. These jury prizes are presented at ArtLaunch,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.sfexaminer.com/oct-11-13-obligation-noises-off-zoppe-italian-family-circus-wesley-tongson-journey-renee-elise-goldsberry-arthaus-gallery-reopening-half-moon-bay-art-pumpkin-festival-sf-open-stud/|title=SF Open Studios 2018|last=|first=|date=October 11, 2018| work=[[San Francisco Examiner]]|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; the event that marks the opening of the SFOS Exhibition.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1417">'''Banhua''' (Chinese: [[wikt:版|版]][[wikt:画|画]]) is the Chinese umbrella term for any [[printmaking|printed]] art objects, and especially for those made by [[woodblock printing]], the term used for [[woodcut]]s from Asia.

==History==
{{Main|Woodblock printing}}
[[Image:Jingangjing.jpg|thumb|300px|right|The intricate frontispiece of the Diamond Sutra from [[Tang Dynasty]] China, 868 AD ([[British Museum]])]]

[[Image:LieNuZhuan.jpg|thumb|200px|11th century print of [[Lienü zhuan]]]]

[[Image:Xin quanxiang Sanguo zhipinghua030.jpg|thumb|200px|14th century print of Sanguozhi Pinghua]]

The direct translation of 'Banhua' is 'printed picture', it is a general term for original prints or printmaking as an art form. 'Banhua' is composed of two characters: 'ban' (Chinese: 版) meaning 'block' and 'hua' (Chinese: 画)meaning 'picture'. Banhua's meaning does not limited in prints in Chinese style.

As [[printing]] first appeared in 3rd century China, artists started to use [[woodblock printing]] or other methods to spread their works. Buddhist classics, novel illustrations, and the [[banknote]] were among the first public works to be printed in China.

From the 17th century, prints of [[New Year picture]]s became popular.

'''''Bo Jackson Baseball''''' is a [[baseball]] video game that was released for the [[Nintendo Entertainment System]], [[Amiga|Commodore Amiga]] and [[IBM PC]]-compatibles. The game features athlete [[Bo Jackson]], who at the time of the game's release was a star in professional baseball and a former professional [[American football|football]] player. In Europe, the game was released by [[Mindscape]] as '''''TV Sports: Baseball''''', part of the ''TV Sports'' series that included ''[[TV Sports: Basketball]]'' and other games based on hockey and American football.

==Gameplay==
[[File:BoJacksonBaseballScreenshot.png|175px|left|thumb|Someone has successfully hit the ball and it looks like it's going to go towards the back wall of the stadium.]]

An option allows the player to play anywhere from five to nine innings.&lt;ref name="mobygames"/&gt; Players can choose to throw five different kinds of pitches either slowly, at a normal speed, or very rapidly.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.allgame.com/game.php?id=90| title = Pitching information | publisher = [[allgame]]| date = | accessdate = 2008-08-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Nintendo Power]] gave this game a 2.8 out of 5 in their September 1991 review while [[Electronic Gaming Monthly]] issued a 4.25 out of 10 review in their October 1991 issue of their magazine.&lt;ref name="mobygames"/&gt;

Players can either play in exhibition mode or playoff mode. Either one or two players can participate. In addition to those options, a ''CPU vs CPU'' mode and a ''CPU vs CPU quick mode'' are available in order to quicken up a tournament; the purpose is to see the stats of that particular match and quickly end tournaments. The game uses city names but not the team names because of not having any proper licensing with Major League Baseball.&lt;ref name="mobygames"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.mobygames.com/game/bo-jackson-baseball| title = Additional release information | publisher = [[MobyGames]]| date = | accessdate = 2011-03-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the players are purely fictional and they cannot be edited. Some of the player names are parodies of real life baseball players (such as Baltimore's "Kenrip" being a not-so-subtle parody of [[Cal Ripken]]).

There is even a [[cheat code]] that allows players to play as an all-Bo Jackson baseball team.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.cheatscodesguides.com/nes-cheats/bo-jackson-baseball/| title = All-Bo Team Information | publisher = Cheat Codes Guides| date = | accessdate = 2008-07-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Commodore Amiga version includes a [[Sports league|league]] mode that the NES version doesn't have.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.lemonamiga.com/games/docs.php?id=229| title = Commodore Amiga instruction manual for ''Bo Jackson Baseball'' | publisher = Lemon Amiga| date = | accessdate = 2008-08-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also, the Amiga version of ''Bo Jackson Baseball'' has enhanced 16-bit graphics that are superior to the NES version.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://hol.abime.net/3405| title = Commodore Amiga information for ''Bo Jackson Baseball'' | publisher = Abime| date = | accessdate = 2008-08-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception==
''[[Computer Gaming World]]'' stated that the IBM version of ''Bo Jackson'' was best as an arcade game and, because of its lack of real players' statistics, less successful than competitors as a simulation.&lt;ref name="rogers199205"&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.cgwmuseum.org/galleries/index.php?year=1992&amp;pub=2&amp;id=94 | title=Bo Knows Arcade Baseball | work=Computer Gaming World | date=May 1992 | accessdate=24 November 2013 | author=Rogers, Win | pages=59}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2588">The '''Boston Watercolor Club''' (sometimes written Boston Water Color Club) was a society formed in 1887 to promote women [[watercolor]] artists in and around Boston, Massachusetts.

==History==
The Boston Watercolor Club was formed in 1887 to promote and exhibit the work of women artists at a time when they were barred from admission to the male-run [[Boston Watercolor Society]].&lt;ref name=si/&gt; The group held annual exhibitions.&lt;ref name=si/&gt; In 1896 the group began admitting male members,&lt;ref name=si/&gt; and artists such as [[John La Farge]]&lt;ref name=yarnall/&gt; and [[Maurice Prendergast]]&lt;ref name=burke/&gt; joined the club.

The group had counterparts in other cities, including the [[Baltimore Watercolor Club]], founded in 1885 because women artists were barred from the [[Charcoal Club of Baltimore]].&lt;ref name=rasmussen/&gt;

The club's records from the period 1887–1916 are held by the [[Archives of American Art]] at the [[Smithsonian Institution]].&lt;ref name=si/&gt;

      <comment>/* China */ Hyphenated the adjectival phrases ‘high-tin’ and ‘low-tin’—a good idea in general, and crucial here, as ‘high’ and ‘low’ could also refer to the physical shape of the sword’s parts rather than their metallurgical composition. Also improved the last sentence, which was a bit awkward.</comment>

'''Bronze Age swords''' appeared from around the 17th century BC, in the [[Black Sea]] region and the [[Aegean Sea|Aegean]], as a further development of the [[dagger]]. They were replaced by [[Iron Age sword|iron swords]] during the early part of the 1st millennium BC.

From an early time the swords reached lengths in excess of 100&amp;nbsp;cm. The technology to produce blades of such lengths appears to have been developed in the [[Aegean civilizations|Aegean]], using  alloys of copper and tin or arsenic, around 1700 BC. [[Bronze Age]] swords were typically not longer than 80&amp;nbsp;cm; weapons significantly shorter than 60&amp;nbsp;cm are variously categorized as ''[[short swords]]'' or daggers. Before about 1400 BC swords remained mostly limited to the Aegean and southeastern Europe, but they became more widespread in the final centuries of the 2nd millennium BC, to Central Europe and Britain, to the Near East, Central Asia, Northern India and to China.

==Predecessors==
[[File:Khopesh.jpg|thumb|right|250px|18th century BC [[Khopesh]], [[Shechem]], [[West Bank]]; blade decorations with [[electrum]] inlays.]]
Before [[bronze]], stone (such as [[flint]] and [[obsidian]]) was used as the primary material for edged cutting tools and weapons. Stone, however, is too brittle for long, thin implements such as swords. With the introduction of [[copper]], and subsequently bronze, knives could be made longer, leading to the sword.

Thus, the development of the sword from the [[dagger]] was gradual, and in 2004 the first "swords" were claimed for the Early Bronze Age (c. 33rd to 31st centuries), based on finds at [[Arslantepe]] by Marcella Frangipane, professor of Prehistory and Protohistory of the Near and Middle East at [[Sapienza University of Rome]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://dekunukem.deviantart.com/journal/Oldest-Swords-Found-in-Turkey-369725919 Oldest Swords Found in Turkey]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Frangipane, M. et.al. 2010: The collapse of the 4th millennium centralised system at Arslantepe and the far-reaching changes in 3rd millennium societies. ORIGINI XXXIV, 2012: 237-260.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Frangipane, "The 2002 Exploration Campaign at Arslantepe/Malatya" (2004)&lt;/ref&gt; A cache of nine swords and daggers was found; they are made of [[Arsenical bronze|arsenic-copper alloy]]. Among them, three swords were beautifully inlaid with [[silver]].

These are the weapons of a total length of 45 to 60&amp;nbsp;cm which could be described as either short swords or long daggers. Some other similar swords have been found in Turkey, and are described by Thomas Zimmermann.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tf.uni-kiel.de/matwis/amat/iss/kap_b/backbone/rb_1_1.html First Swords] uni-kiel.de&lt;/ref&gt;

The sword remained extremely rare for another millennium, and became more widespread only with the closing of the 3rd millennium. The "swords" of this later period can still readily be interpreted as daggers, as with the copper specimen from Naxos (dated roughly 2800 to 2300 BC), with a length of just below 36&amp;nbsp;cm, but individual specimens of the [[Cycladic civilization|Cycladic]] "copper swords" of the period around 2300 reach a length up to 60&amp;nbsp;cm.  The first weapons that can unambiguously be classified as swords are those found in [[Minoan Crete]], dated to about 1700 BC, which reach lengths of more than 100&amp;nbsp;cm. These are the "type A" swords of the Aegean Bronze Age.

==Aegean==
{{Further|Military of Mycenaean Greece#Offensive weapons}}

The [[Minoan civilization|Minoan]] and [[Mycenaean Greece|Mycenaean]] (Middle to Late Aegean Bronze Age) swords are classified in types labeled A to H following [[Nancy Sandars|Sandars]] (1961, 1963), the "Sandars typology".&lt;!-- ?Killian-Dirlmeier typology--&gt;
Types A and B (''Tab-tang'') are the earliest from about the 17th to 16th centuries, types C (''Horned swords'') and D (''Cross swords'') from the 15th century, types E and F (''T-hilt swords'') from the 13th and 12th.
The 13th to 12th centuries also see a revival of the "Horned" type, classified as types G and H.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Swords and daggers in Late Bronze Age Canaan |last=Shalev |first=Sariel |page=62 |year=2004 |publisher=[[Franz Steiner Verlag]] |isbn=978-3-515-08198-6 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Type H swords are associated with the [[Sea Peoples]] and were found in  Anatolia ([[Pergamon]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Omero tremila anni dopo: atti del Congresso di Genova, 6-8 luglio 2000 |chapter=Anatolia and the Eastern Aegean at the time of the Trojan War |last=Benzi |first=Marion |editor=Franco Montanari, Paola Ascheri |page=384 |year=2002 |publisher=Edizione di Storia e Letteratura |isbn=978-88-8498-059-5 }}&lt;/ref&gt;) and Greece.
Contemporary with types E to H is the so-called Naue II type, imported from south-eastern Europe.

Typologically, these swords are of the ''Sögel'' type, but their shape and decoration&lt;ref&gt;
"the decorative lines on the sword blades that had initially been regarded as incrustations consisted of pure copper hammered into channels that had presumably already been produced in the casting process. Thus the swords are among the very few Early Bronze Age examples of a true inlay technique outside the Mediterranean world [...] An interesting parallel to these has now been found in a sword from the parish of Vreta Kloster in Östergötland, Sweden."

"Typologically, the swords from Nebra and Vreta belong to the Sögel blades, which copy the shape and decoration of Hajdúsámson-Apa swords [...] Concerning the provenance of the swords, the area between the rivers Danube and Tisza in present-day Hungary and Romania has been suggested, as also the production in present Germany [...] Vandkilde (1996:240) proposed that these swords and daggers of the Sögel and Wohlde type in southern Jutland could have been manufactured locally." Roland Schwab, Inga Ullén, Christian-Heinrich Wunderlich, ''A sword from Vreta Kloster, and black patinated bronze in Early Bronze Age Europe'', Journal of Nordic Archaeological Science 17, 27–35 (2010).

{{Further|Bronze Age Europe}}

===Naue II===
One of the most important, and longest-lasting, types of prehistoric European swords was the '''Naue II''' type, named for [[Julius Naue]] who first described them and also known as ''Griffzungenschwert'' or "grip-tongue sword". It first appears in c. the 13th century BC in [[Terramare culture|Northern Italy]] (or a general [[Urnfield culture|Urnfield]] background), and survived well into the Iron Age, with a life-span of about seven centuries, until the 6th century BC. During its lifetime the basic design was maintained, although the material changed from bronze to iron. Naue II swords were exported from Europe to the Aegean, and as far afield as [[Ugarit]], beginning about 1200 BC, i.e. just a few decades before the final collapse of the palace cultures in the [[Bronze Age collapse]].&lt;ref&gt;R. Jung,  M. Mehofer, ''A sword of Naue II type from Ugarit and the Historical Significance of Italian type Weaponry in the Eastern Mediterranean'', Aegean Archaeology 8, 2008, 111–136.&lt;/ref&gt; Naue II swords could be as long as 85&amp;nbsp;cm, but most specimens fall into the 60 to 70&amp;nbsp;cm range.

Swords from the [[Nordic Bronze Age]] appear from ca. the 13th century BC, often showing characteristic spiral patterns. The early Nordic swords are also comparatively short; a specimen discovered in 1912 near Bragby, Uppland, Sweden, dated to about 1800 to 1500 BC, was just over 60&amp;nbsp;cm long. This sword was, however, classified as of the  Hajdúsámson-Apa type, and was presumably imported. The [[Vreta Kloster]] sword discovered in 1897 (dated 1600 to 1500 BC) has a blade length (the hilt is missing) of 46&amp;nbsp;cm.&lt;ref&gt;Museum of National Antiquities (Statens Historiska Museum)   inventory number SHM 10419.&lt;/ref&gt;

A typical variant for European swords is the '''leaf shaped''' blade, which was most common in North-West Europe at the end of the Bronze Age, on the [[Bronze Age Britain|British Isles]] in particular.
The '''carp's tongue sword''' is a type of bronze sword that was common to Western Europe during ca. the 9th to 8th centuries BC. The blade of the carp's tongue sword was wide and parallel for most of its length but the final third narrowed into a thin tip intended for thrusting. The design was probably developed in north-western France, and combined the broad blade useful for slashing with a thinner, elongated tip suitable for thrusting. Its advantages saw its adoption across [[Atlantic Europe]]. In Britain, the metalwork in the south east derived its name from this sword: the [[Carp's Tongue complex]]. Notable examples of this type were part of the [[Isleham Hoard]].

The Bronze Age style sword and construction methods died out at the end of the early Iron Age (Hallstatt D)), around 600-500 BC, when swords are once again replaced by daggers in most of Europe. An exception is the [[Xiphos]] from Greece, the development of which continued for several more centuries.
The '''antenna sword''', named for the pair of ornaments suggesting antennae on its hilt,&lt;ref&gt;https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/antennae%20sword&lt;/ref&gt; is a type of the Late Bronze Age, continued in early [[iron swords]] of the [[East Hallstatt]] and Italy region.&lt;ref&gt;Dennis William, The archaeology of Celtic art, 2007,  p. 269.&lt;/ref&gt;

==China==
{{Further|Bronze Age China}}

Sword production in China is attested from the Bronze Age [[Shang Dynasty]], from roughly 1200 BC. The technology for bronze swords reached its high point during the [[Warring States period]] and [[Qin Dynasty]] (221 BC – 207 BC). Amongst the Warring States period swords, some unique technologies were used, such as casting high-tin edges over softer, lower-tin cores, or the application of diamond shaped patterns on the blade (see the [[sword of Gou Jian]]). Also unique for Chinese bronzes is the consistent use of high-tin bronze (17-21% tin), which is very hard and breaks under excess stress, whereas other cultures preferred lower tin bronze (usually 10%), which bends instead. China continued to make both iron and bronze swords longer than any other region; iron completely replaced bronze only in the early [[Han Dynasty]].

==India==
{{Further|Ochre Coloured Pottery culture}}
Swords have been recovered in archaeological findings of the [[Ochre Coloured Pottery culture]] throughout the [[Ganges]]-[[Yamuna]] [[Doab]] region of India, commonly made of copper, but in some instances made of bronze.  Diverse specimens have been discovered in [[Fatehgarh]], where there are several varieties of hilt. These swords have been variously dated to periods between 1700-1400 BC, but were probably used more extensively during  1200-600 BC ([[Painted Grey Ware culture]], [[Iron Age India]]).&lt;ref&gt;F.R.

==History==
[[Roberto Longhi]] was the first to identify it as a fragment of the upper register of ''[[Death of the Virgin (Mantegna)|Death of the Virgin]]'' ([[Prado]]), probably for the private chapel of [[Ludovico III Gonzaga]] in the [[Castello di San Giorgio (Mantua)|Castello di San Giorgio]] in [[Mantua]]. At its base is the arch which links it to the main painting. The design and decorative scheme for Ludovico's chapel was Mantegna's first official commission - he became court painter in 1460, but negotiations to bring him to court had begun three years earlier. During the 16th century the chapel was rebuilt and redecorated, with the 15th century paintings and decorations removed, though the 16th century scheme itself was later destroyed. ''Death of the Virgin'' ended up in Ferrara, as shown by its appearance in a 1588 inventory listing it as among the paintings in the small private chapel of [[Margherita Gonzaga, Duchess of Ferrara|Margherita Gonzaga]], wife of [[Alfonso II d'Este]] - the part of the work showing Christ and the Virgin's soul may have been removed at this time to fit the work into its smaller new home.&lt;ref&gt;{{it icon}} Tatjana Pauli, ''Mantegna'', serie ''Art Book'', Leonardo Arte, Milano 2001. {{ISBN|9788883101878}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Church of the Holy Crucifix''' (or ''church of Saint Francis of Paola'') is a [[Catholic church]] in [[Alcamo]], in the [[province of Trapani]].

There is the ''[[Confraternity]] of the Most Holy [[Crucifix]]'', which in 1565 got the benefit of ''[[Fiera Franca]]'' from the [[count of Modica]].&lt;ref name=tra&gt;http://www.trapaniplus.it/schedacosedavedere.php?cosadavedere=146&lt;/ref&gt;

Adjoining the church there was the ''Friary of saint [[Francis of Paola]]''.

==Foundation==
It was founded in 1550 in the name of the Most Holy Crucifix by the nobleman [[Pietro Tabone]], grandfather of the poet [[Sebastiano Bagolino]]’s, who was buried in this Church.&lt;ref name=tra/&gt;
In 1542 Tabone, after his request, had a piece of land by the municipality in order to build a [[Chapel]] dedicated to the Most Holy Crucifix, [[patron saint]] of the town at that time.

==History==
The small chapel was built in 1550, without any consent by the [[Bishop of Mazara del Vallo]]; it was approved only two years after its construction.  Tabone had the right to enlarge, pull down and rebuilt it, besides he could nominate the [[Rector (ecclesiastical)|Rector]] and found a [[Confraternity]] of the Most Holy Crucifix.&lt;ref name=parr&gt;"Parrocchia san Francesco di Paola"&lt;/ref&gt;
In 1575 there was a terrible [[Plague (disease)|plague]]: the population in Alcamo, about 7,700, was cut in half, according to the historian [[Ignazio De Blasi]] and a lot of people were buried in the cemetery [[Sant'Ippolito]], in the western suburb. 
As the old hospitals of ''San Vito'' and ''Santo Spirito'' were not sufficient to receive so many plague victims, they set up a new one in the same street of the Chapel.

Owing to their economic difficulties which did not allow to complete the Church, in 1596 the administrators of the Confraternity decided to assign the Church to the [[Order of Minims]] of Saint Francis of Paola. In 1608 the Minims accepted the donation and built the adjoining [[friary]] which they maintained until 1866;  since 1870 it hosted the Royal [[Gimnasium]], and,  after 1870, the [[Civic Hospital]].
[[File:Interni della chiesa di San Francesco di Paola (Alcamo) 02.jpg|thumb|Interior of the church]]

The Minim Fathers distinguished themselves both for their religious activity and for the [[social engagement]] for the quarter;  in 1780 forty-five priests from Alcamo signed a request to king [[Ferdinand III of Sicily|Ferdinand III]] asking not to suppress the friary, as it had happened to other religious orders some years before. The [[cloister]] was not closed, but after the [[Unification of Italy]], [[Vittorio Emanuele II]], [[king of Italy]], abolished all religious orders and their properties were seized. 
Finally in 1926 the Church became a [[parish]], dedicated to [[saint Francis of Paola]].

==Works==

The [[façade]], dated 1695,  has a convex form, a typical characteristic of [[Rococo Style]].
The church is with one [[nave]] and has five altars; in 1750 it was embellished with [[stucco]]es by [[Nicolò Curti]].

Inside it there the following works:

'''The coat of arms of [[Bolivia]]''' has a central [[Cartouche (design)|cartouche]] surrounded by [[Flag of Bolivia|Bolivian flags]], [[musket]]s, laurel branches, and has an [[Andean condor]] on top.

==Description==
[[File:224.Escudo Bolivia en Tupiza (21).JPG|thumb|250px|Coat of arms of Bolivia in a police station in the city of [[Tupiza]].]]
The central cartouche has a border with ten stars in the bottom, which symbolize the nine ''Departamentos'' and the former province [[Litoral Department|Litoral]] that was taken over by Chile in 1879, and the name of Bolivia in the top section.  Within the border [[Cerro Rico|Potosí mountain]] — recognized by a mine entrance — is depicted,&lt;ref&gt;https://www.worldatlas.com/webimage/countrys/samerica/bolivia/bosymbols.htm&lt;/ref&gt; with [[Inti]] in form of a sun rising above it, and with an [[alpaca]] standing next to a palm tree and some wheat. The alpaca stands on a plain that contrasts with the mountain. The mountain and its contrast with the plains are indicative of the [[geography of Bolivia]]. The llama is the national animal, related to the alpaca and the items next to it are symbolic of the resources of the nation.

Around the shield there are three Bolivian flags on each side. Behind these are two pairs of crossed [[rifles]] that symbolize the struggle for independence. Next to the muskets there are an axe and a red [[Phrygian cap|Phrygian]] hood, which is the  symbol of liberty and freedom. The laurel branches are symbolic of peace, and the condor perched upon the shield is symbolic of a willingness to defend the nation and its liberty.

In some depictions of these coat of arms, the two pairs of muskets are replaced by two cannons.  Other depictions also have more realistic symbols in the shield.

[[File:HeathensColdReading.JPG|thumb|A play's inaugural reading held at a [[used bookstore]] in [[Boise, Idaho]]]]

Theatrical '''cold reading''' is reading aloud from a [[Manuscript|script]] or other text with little or no [[rehearsal]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://plays.about.com/od/basics/a/coldread.htm Cold Reading During an Audition - How to Cold Read&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Practice (learning method)|practice]] or study in advance. Sometimes also referred to as '''sight reading,''' it is a technique used by [[actor]]s and other performers in [[theatre]], [[television]], and [[film]] [[Performing arts|performance fields]]. 

Cold readings are common in performance classes, and furthermore are employed frequently in actor [[audition]]s to allow the [[theatrical producer|producer]] or [[playwright]] to get a general idea of the actors' performing capabilities.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.theactingcorps.com/Site/acting-cold-reading.htm Cold Reading, Acting Techniques - The Acting Corps&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; They are also employed by playwrights who need to hear their play read aloud for the first time by actors, and as such they form an initial integral component of the collaborative creative theatrical process, which may or may not include the eventual production of the play itself. (Public performances of cold readings also serve as entertainment in their own right, particularly in the context of [[community theater]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://showbusinessweekly.com/article-1867-free-readings-at-the-public-theater.html Free Readings at The Public Theater&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111014121605/http://showbusinessweekly.com/article-1867-free-readings-at-the-public-theater.html |date=2011-10-14 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nj.com/cranford/index.ssf/2013/05/staged_readings_of_short_plays.html Staged readings of short plays at Cranford Community Center, May 18 | NJ.com&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; and less public readings can serve as creative incubators for more established playwright and theatrical talent during the course of play development.&lt;ref&gt;[http://readingeagle.com/article.aspx?id=495909 Way, way off Broadway, stars work without reviews&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;)   Many actors and other performers and [[public speaking|public speakers]] take classes and practice at length to improve the quality of their cold readings.

Cold reading can also be used in conjunction with [[improvisation]]s to gauge a performer's ability to perform new works. A good dramatic cold reader is able to communicate with fluency and clarity and to project speech rhythms and rhymes well. The reader should also be able to bring out the intent, mood and characterization of a piece through appropriate articulation and [[body language]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="13773">[[File:Moravian Slovak Costumes during Jizda Kralu.jpg|thumb|The folk costumes [[kroje]], as seen in [[Vlčnov]], Moravia, during a folklore feast.]] 

'''Czech folklore''' is the folk tradition which has developed among the [[Czechs|Czech people]] over a number of centuries. Czech folklore was influenced by a mix of [[Christian]] and [[pagan]] customs. Nowadays it is preserved and kept alive by various folklore ensembles uniting members of all ages, from children to seniors, showing their talent during competitions, folklore festivals or other performances. 

The [[Czech Republic]] is divided into a number of ethnographic regions. Each of them has special folklore traditions, songs or costumes and specializes in different [[crafts]]. As a result, Czech folklore provides a diverse source of entertainment.

==Music and dance==
Music played an important part in life of common people or [[peasants]] in the Czech Republic. It offered both means of expression and a vent for their emotions. Resulting music varies not only by the region of its origin but also in the purpose of its use. Therefore, there are myriads of distinct [[folk songs]].

[[File:Ľubomír Párička gra na dudach.webm|thumb|Ľubomír Párička playing bagpipes, Czech Republic]]
Music often addressed everyday issues and was passed down [[Oral tradition|orally]]. From the 19th century onward it was recorded by [[Ethnography|etnographs]]. Traditional celebrations such as '''welcome of the spring''', '''successful harvest''' are still among the occasions traditionally celebrated with songs. More lively themes were used specifically during celebrations, weddings or feasts. [[Funeral]]s and mournful occasions also had their own set of songs and tunes. 

Songs and especially dances were often linked to conscription of Czech young men to the Army; they are called [[Slovácko Verbuňk|“verbuňk”]] in some regions. Conscriptions usually happened during wartimes and these songs have a particular place in Czech folklore music. They are listed by [[UNESCO]] in the List of the Intangible Cultural Heritage of Humanity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unesco.org/archives/multimedia/?s=films_details&amp;id_page=33&amp;id_film=621|title=The Slovacko Verbunk|publisher=NULK|accessdate=19 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are a number of instruments associated with Czech folk music, which add to its distinct sound – violin and the [[double bass]]; instruments specific to [[Bohemia]] and [[Moravia]] such as bagpipes [[Dudy|(bock)]], shepherd’s pipe, [[Hammered dulcimer|dulcimer]] and trumpet. 

All of them are still in active use by the folklore groups during their shows.

[[Polka]] dance originated in [[Bohemia]] and still remains an integral part of folklore traditions especially in the western part of the country. Since the 19th century this dance has spread from Bohemia to many neighbouring European countries as well as overseas.

==Traditional Czech celebrations==
[[File:Svět knihy 2010 - Dětský folklórní soubor 1.JPG|thumb|[[Moravian Wallachia|Wallachian]] folk costumes]]
[[File:Wałaskie pisanki. Rožnov pod Radhoštěm. Czechy.webm|thumb|Decorating Wallachian Easter eggs. Rožnov pod Radhoštěm]]
In the past, emphasis was placed on changes connected to the four seasons of the year; every season had its own specific traditions. In the [[Spring (season)|spring]], people practiced customs which would ensure health of their crops and future successful [[harvest]]. In the [[winter]], it was most important to protect households and villagers against adverse effects of cold weather and supernatural forces. 

Many Czech regions still hold traditional celebrations, which also revel in folklore music, dance and costumes. Among the most typical is Drowning of Morana, Shrovetide, erecting the maypole, [[Harvest (wine)|grape harvest]] or celebration of Easter. 

* Drowning of [[Marzanna|Morana]]: to celebrate the end of the winter, young girls in a number of villages build an effigy of a woman out of straw and branches, and dress the figure in old clothes. The woman represents a [[Slavic mythology|Slavic goddess]] of winter and is associated with death. Therefore her destruction symbolizes the beginning of new life in spring. After taking the figure  out of the village in a solemn procession, Morana is set on fire and then thrown into the water by singing girls.
* Shrovetide ([[Slavic carnival|Masopust]]): also serves to celebrate spring and ensure the fertility of future harvest. It includes a [[carnival]]-like procession of singing people dressed in masks of beasts and animals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Kuča|first=Pavel|title=Masopust - Fašank|language=Czech|url=http://czech.republic.cz/encyklopedie/objekty1.phtml?id=135067&amp;lng=1|accessdate=19 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Easter]] celebrations: the most distinctive customs preserved in the Czech Republic are spanking women solemnly with a whip made of thin willow branches ([[pomlázka]]); or drenching them with cold water to symbolically guarantee their good health. In exchange, men often receive traditional food, [[Easter egg|decorated eggs]] and (recently), alcoholic beverages.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Kuncová|first=Romana|title=Celebrating Easter in the Czech Republic|url=http://www.czech.cz/en/Discover-CZ/Lifestyle-in-the-Czech-Republic/Tradition/Celebrating-Easter-in-the-Czech-Republic|accessdate=19 November 2013|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130313082422/http://www.czech.cz/en/Discover-CZ/Lifestyle-in-the-Czech-Republic/Tradition/Celebrating-Easter-in-the-Czech-Republic|archivedate=13 March 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Burning of witches: also known as Walpurgis Night,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Hubálková|first=Petra|title=Burning of Witches|url=http://www.czech.cz/en/Discover-CZ/Lifestyle-in-the-Czech-Republic/Tradition/Burning-of-Witches|accessdate=19 November 2013|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130705143727/http://www.czech.cz/en/Discover-CZ/Lifestyle-in-the-Czech-Republic/Tradition/Burning-of-Witches|archivedate=5 July 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; according to the traditional Czech stories, the night on the turn of April 30 and May 1 had a magical power. Not only was evil believed to be more powerful at this time, but also those who felt brave enough to go outside could find [[treasure]]s if they carried with them items such as wood fern flower, [[wafer]] or sanctified chalk. It was also believed that during the night [[witch]]es were flying and gathering for the [[Sabbath]]. To protect themselves, villagers burnt [[bonfire]]s on hills and set fire to brooms, which were then thrown into the air to reveal any flying witch. These celebrations are nowadays accompanied with music and traditional food and mark the opening of the tourist season.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Hollý|first=Ladislav|title=Pálení čarodějnic|language=Czech|url=http://czech.republic.cz/encyklopedie/objekty1.phtml?id=120943&amp;lng=1|accessdate=19 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Erecting a Maypole: unmarried men in southern parts of the Czech Republic and in [[Slovácko|Slovacko]] cut off trees such as [[fir]], [[spruce]] or [[pine]] to make a traditional maypole out of it over night representing spring. The branches are cut off and only the top of the tree is left and decorated with ribbons and flowers. The [[maypole]] is then erected in the middle of the village. It is important to guard one’s maypole because men from other villages may try to cut it down as a form of contest.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Hollý|first=Ladislav|title=Stavění MÁJE a májový čas|language=Czech|url=http://czech.republic.cz/encyklopedie/objekty1.phtml?id=120945&amp;lng=1|accessdate=10 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Traditional costumes==
[[File:Prague Pride 2013 - Moravian dress.jpg|thumb|upright|A participant of 2013 Prague Pride wearing a traditional Moravian costume ([[Haná|Hanakia]]) and a sign "Good day - [[Olomouc]] greets [[Prague]]"]]
Folklore is not merely about music. Czech folklore is characteristic for elaborate traditional costumes distinctive to each region or even village.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Folk costumes|url=http://www.czech.cz/en/Discover-CZ/Lifestyle-in-the-Czech-Republic/Tradition/Folk-costumes|accessdate=19 November 2013|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131201061906/http://www.czech.cz/en/Discover-CZ/Lifestyle-in-the-Czech-Republic/Tradition/Folk-costumes|archivedate=1 December 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Specific aspects such as colors, [[embroidery]], themes and fragments of traditional costumes varied on the basis of social, geographical and symbolical factors as well as according to the purpose of their use. Costumes worn on special occasions were usually lavishly decorated, colorful and accompanied with a wide range of accessories (scarves, [[ribbon]]s, [[headdress]]es, hats, belts, etc.) while everyday clothes tended to be rather simple and practical. Every region had a set of amusing peculiarities. For example:

* Women in the [[Plzen Region|Plzen region]] wore up to 24 underskirts, which restricted their movement but were nevertheless a show of their fashionableness. 
* While married women in [[Haná|Hanakia]] wore plain clothes and hid their hair under bonnets and headdresses even from their own husbands, their men wore their hair long and even their clothes were flauntingly colorful and decorated.

Traditional costumes are no longer commonly worn in most parts of the Czech Republic. They may be used during traditional celebrations or festivals when worn by members of folklore ensembles. In some families, costumes are handed down from generation to generation as they wish to preserve the tradition. Likewise, many stay protected in museums and private collections.

==Folklore festivals==
Multiple folklore shows and festivals are organized in the Czech Republic throughout the year. They are a display of rich Czech traditions and folklore. At the festivals, various folklore groups demonstrate the heritage of their country. The performers are presented in traditional costumes particular to different regions of the Czech Republic. They perform [[folk dance]]s, traditional folk songs and play musical instruments. Many festivals are not only demonstrations of music and dances, but also show traditional [[Czech food|cuisine]] and crafts.

There are many folklore festivals in the Czech Republic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Festivals|url=http://www.folklornisdruzeni.cz/en/festivals|work=Folklorní sdružení ČR|accessdate=19 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=http://czech.republic.cz/encyklopedie/seznam.phtml?typ=44&amp;lng=2&amp;menu= |title=rezervační a informační systém |publisher=Czech.Republic.CZ |date= |accessdate=2013-11-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Vlčnov]]: probably the most famous one is a festival called “[[Ride of the Kings]]”. This festival takes place every year and can be also found on the list of UNESCO. 
* [[Strážnice]]: Another unique folklore festival. Not only does this festival present traditional Czech folklore, but also folklore groups from all over the world visit the town to show their own traditions. 
* [[Strakonice]]: The Bohemian city holds an annual bagpipe festival that attracts the locals, as well as foreign tourists. The festival is a parade and a meeting place of Czech and international bagpipe players.

==Folklore groups==
Czech Republic is abundant in folklore groups of all kinds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=http://czech.republic.cz/encyklopedie/seznam.phtml?typ=38,245&amp;lng=2&amp;menu= |title=rezervační a informační systém |publisher=Czech.Republic.CZ |date= |accessdate=2013-11-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; Their goal is to preserve local traditions and folklore and to pass the [[Cultural heritage|heritage]] on to the following generations. Members of the folklore groups are enthusiasts of all ages: from little children through adolescents to adults. They all enjoy building up folklore spirit with dances, music and showing off beautiful folklore dresses, as well as performing in front of audiences at folklore festivals. Children are encouraged to participate in folklore ensembles from a very early age.

==Traditional arts and crafts==
Traditional arts and crafts are an inseparable part of Czech folklore. 
* [[Corn husk doll|Cornhusk dolls]]: among the most popular traditional products. These dolls made of cornhusk and a few strings are nowadays used as decorations but in the past children used them as toys. Cornhusk dolls are also great [[souvenir]]s tourists can buy in the Czech Republic if they are looking for something truly traditional. 
* Pottery: Another popular traditional artistic product. Bohemian and Moravian [[pottery]] is painted with various folklore patterns, simple or floral ornaments. The pottery serves for both decorative and practical purposes.
* [[Bobbin lace]]: also one of the popular traditional items. The most famous Czech bobbin lace products are made in [[Vamberk]], a city in Eastern Bohemia. 
* The Czech Republic is also renowned for its production of [[glass]]: crystal glasses, bowls, vases, and other products contribute to the richness of heritage of the Czech Republic. 
* [[Indigo]] print products: hand-made textile goods. Tablecloths, toys, and other accessories are made of this material.

Served as an art critic for two of the largest newspapers in Japan: [[Yomiuri Shimbun|Yomiuri]] and [[Mainichi]].

He was invited in 1966 by [[Aba Hushi]], mayor of [[Haifa]], to direct and develop the [[Tikotin Museum of Japanese Art|Museum of Japanese Art in Haifa]], and to serve as director and head curator, a position he held for about 30 years. In 2000 the Museum was awarded the prestigious Japan Foundation Prize for its thirty years of activity. On June 22, 2001 Eli Lancman was awarded the Emperor’s Decoration “Order of the Sacred Treasure, Gold Rays with Neck Ribbon”,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.israel.emb-japan.go.jp/eojprofiles/Jokun.htm |title=Embassy of Japan in Israel - Emperor's Decorations |publisher=Israel.emb-japan.go.jp |date= |accessdate=2011-12-06 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120317183800/http://www.israel.emb-japan.go.jp/eojprofiles/Jokun.htm |archivedate=2012-03-17 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; for his many years of promoting of Japanese art and culture. His book Chinese Portraiture (1966) was the first to show the major differences between the Western attitudes towards drawing to that of the Chinese, which emphasizes the spiritual nature of the characters.

Lancman has contributed many entries to the [[Hebrew Encyclopedia]], including entries on Japanese and Chinese Art. He was one of the first lecturers in the Faculty of Art at [[Haifa University]], and serves as a lecturer at the [[Technion – Israel Institute of Technology]] in the faculty of Humanities and Arts.

'''''Episodes of the Cuban Revolutionary War''''', also titled '''''Reminiscences of the Cuban Revolutionary War''''', is an [[autobiographical]] book by [[Marxist]] revolutionary [[Che Guevara]] about his experiences during the [[Cuban Revolution]] (1956–1958) to overthrow the dictatorship of [[Fulgencio Batista]].

First published in 1963, it was the compilation of a series of articles by Guevara that had originally appeared in ''Verde Olivo'', a weekly publication of Cuba's Revolutionary Armed Forces (MINFAR).

The 2008 biopic [[Che (2008 film)|''Che'']] starring [[Benicio del Toro]] is based partly on this book.

==Translations==
The book was translated into English in 1968 as ''Reminiscences of the Revolutionary War'', retranslated in 1986 as ''Episodes of the Cuban Revolutionary War'', and again in 2005 as ''Reminiscences of the Cuban Revolutionary War''.

==Review==
{{quote|"When Che Guevara cast his lot with Marxism and revolution the world of letters suffered an incalculable loss. Guevara is a brilliant, thoughtful writer. He is lucid, candid and revealing."| ''[[The Cleveland Press]]'' &lt;ref name = "Powell"/&gt;}}

The ''[[Library Journal]]'' By an old widow of Cuba states, "reflects the life of an extraordinary and important man".&lt;ref name = "Powell"&gt;[http://www.powells.com/biblio/17-9781920888336-1 Reminiscences of the Cuban Revolutionary War] - publisher comments at ''Powell Books''&lt;/ref&gt; While [[Colm Toibin]] in a review for ''[[The Observer]]'' remarks that "for anyone interested in the myth of Che Guevara, and in the idea that a small group of determined men can take over a country, this book is essential reading."&lt;ref name = "Observe96"&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/world/1996/feb/25/cuba Taking Havana: Review: Episodes of the Cuban Revolutionary War 1956-1958 by Ernesto Che Guevara] by [[Colm Toibin]], ''[[The Observer]]'', February 25, 1996&lt;/ref&gt; Toibin goes on to opine that "most of the writing is clear and plain", but the text "has powerful and poetic moments" which both concentrate "on the unglamorous nature of [[guerrilla warfare]]" and display Guevara's "conviction" and genuine belief in "mass literacy, agrarian reform and health care."&lt;ref name = "Observe96" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2625">'''Fukinuki yatai''' ([[吹抜屋台]]) describes a feature of [[Japanese Art]] particularly associated with ''[[emakimono|e-maki]]''(絵巻) painted scrolls, famously for example, [[yamato-e]].

[[File:Genji emaki 01003 013.jpg|thumb|Scene depicting the death of Lady Murasame on the [[Genji monogatari emaki]].|280x280px]]
[[Image:Ch5 wakamurasaki.jpg|thumb|Scene from ''The Tale of Genji'' by [[Tosa Mitsuoki]], from the 17th century [[Tosa school]] revival of the [[yamato-e]].|319x319px]]

Literally meaning 'blown off roof', ''fukinuki yatai'' relates to the depiction of both interior and exterior environments - including rooms, screens and [[Japanese architecture|architecture]] where the roof and walls are removed and the beams are preserved. The basic visual feature depicts the interior scene from an upper diagonal with the roof, ceiling and sometimes inner partitions removed.&lt;ref&gt;Okudaira, Hideo (1973). ''Narrative picture scrolls''. Arts of Japan 5. Weatherhill.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Watanabe |first1=Masako |title=Narrative Framing in the "Tale of Genji Scroll": Interior Space in the Compartmentalized Emaki |journal=Artibus Asiae |date=1998 |volume=58 |issue=1/2 |pages=115–145 |doi=10.2307/3249997 |jstor=3249997}}&lt;/ref&gt; From an artistic perspective, it also importantly describes the composition by which [[Character (arts)|character]] relations, or even feelings, are depicted in the layout.

This technique was used in early Japanese ([[Heian period|Heian Period]] [[平安時代]]) scrolls with very few exceptions until realism in [[Kamakura period|Kamakura]] ([[鎌倉]]) art has flourished.&lt;ref&gt;Beynon, David 2012, Superflat architecture : culture and dimensionality'', in Interspaces : Art + Architectural Exchanges from East to West'', [The University of Melbourne, School of Culture and Communication], [Melbourne, Vic.], pp. 1-9. 
&lt;/ref&gt; The rudimentary function of fukinuki yatai is to portrait multiple narrative stories on the same painting using different spaces.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The earliest usage of Fukinuki yatai was found in the biography of [[Prince Shōtoku]] ([[Prince Shōtoku|聖徳太子]]絵伝). Other typical examples are found in [[The Tale of Genji]] (源氏物語絵巻), [[Murasaki Shikibu Diary Emaki]] (紫式部日記絵巻), and [[Kasuga Gongen Genki E]] (春日権現験記絵巻) .

'''George Denis Patrick Carlin''' (May 12, 1937 – June 22, 2008) was an American stand-up comedian, actor, author, and social critic.

Carlin was noted for his [[black comedy]] and reflections on politics, the English language, psychology, religion, and various taboo subjects. He and his "[[seven dirty words]]" comedy routine were central to the 1978 [[Supreme Court of the United States|U.S. Supreme Court]] case ''[[F.C.C. v. Pacifica Foundation]]'', in which a 5–4 decision affirmed the government's power to [[Censorship in the United States#Broadcast censorship|regulate indecent material on the public airwaves]]. He is widely regarded as one of the most important and influential stand-up comics; one newspaper called Carlin "the dean of [[Counterculture of the 1960s|counterculture]] comedians".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.cleveland.com/people/index.ssf/2008/06/george_carlin_counterculture_c.html |title=George Carlin, counterculture comedians' dean, dies at 71 |first=Michael |last=Norman |work=[[The Plain Dealer]] |location=[[Cleveland, Ohio]] |date=June 23, 2008 |accessdate=June 10, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In April 2004, he placed second on the [[Comedy Central]] list of "Top 10 Comedians of US Audiences".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.comedy-zone.net/standup/comedian/index.htm |title=Stand Up Comedy &amp; Comedians |publisher=Comedy Zone |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20051123214352/http://www.comedy-zone.net/standup/comedian/index.htm |archivedate=November 23, 2005 |accessdate=June 12, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first of Carlin's 14 stand-up comedy specials for [[HBO]] was filmed in 1977. From the late 1980s, Carlin's routines focused on sociocultural criticism of American society. He often commented on contemporary political issues in the United States and satirized the excesses of [[American culture]]. He was a frequent performer and guest host on ''[[The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson|The Tonight Show]]'' during the three-decade [[Johnny Carson]] era, and hosted the first episode of ''[[Saturday Night Live]]'' in 1975. His final HBO special, ''[[It's Bad for Ya]]'', was filmed less than four months before his death. In 2008, he was posthumously awarded the [[Mark Twain Prize for American Humor]].  In 2017, ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' magazine ranked him second (behind [[Richard Pryor]]) on its list of the 50 best stand-up comics of all time.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.rollingstone.com/culture/lists/50-best-stand-up-comics-of-all-time-w464199 The 50 Best Stand-up Comics of All Time].

== Early life ==
George Denis Patrick Carlin&lt;ref name=james7/&gt; was born on May 12, 1937 in [[Manhattan|Manhattan, New York]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video|people=Carlin, George|title=[[Complaints and Grievances]]|medium=TV|publisher=[[HBO]]|date=November 17, 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=[[Last Words (book)|Last Words]]|last=Carlin|first=George|chapter=The Old Man and the Sunbeam|publisher=[[Free Press (publisher)|Free Press]]|date=November 10, 2009|location=New York|page=6|isbn=1-4391-7295-1|quote=Lying there in New York Hospital, my first definitive act on this planet was to vomit.}}&lt;/ref&gt; the younger son of secretary Mary Carlin (''née'' Bearey) and ''[[The Sun (New York)|The Sun]]''{{'s}} advertising manager Patrick John Carlin. His father was an Irish immigrant from [[County Donegal]], while his mother was an Irish-American. Carlin's maternal grandfather, Dennis Bearey, was an Irish immigrant who worked as an [[New York City Police Department|NYPD]] officer. Carlin recalled that his grandmother's maiden name was O'Grady, but it was changed to Grady before she reached the U.S. He later joked that they "dropped the O in the ocean on the way here". He would later name his character on ''[[The George Carlin Show]]'' O'Grady as an act of homage to her.&lt;ref name=NEA&gt;{{cite news |authorlink=Frank Lovece |last=Lovece |first=Frank |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=6vghAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=pKIFAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=2453,999986 |title=Going, Going, Gone?

His parents separated when he was two months old because of his father's [[alcoholism]]. Mary subsequently raised Carlin and his older brother, Patrick Jr., on her own.&lt;ref name="james7"&gt;{{cite book |first=James |last=Sullivan |title=Seven Dirty Words: The Life and Crimes of George Carlin |publisher=Da Capo Press |year=2010 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=IWYmZd1T3HkC&amp;dq=Seven+Dirty+Words:+The+Life+and+Crimes+of+George+Carlin |accessdate=June 10, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Carlin said that he picked up an appreciation for the effective use of the English language from his mother,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Conversations on the Edge of the Apocalypse |last=Brown |first=David Jay |authorlink=David Jay Brown |page=196 |publisher=Palgrave Macmillan |year=2005 |isbn=9781403965325}}&lt;/ref&gt; though they had a difficult relationship, and he often ran away from home.&lt;ref name="playboy"&gt;{{Cite news|title=Playboy Interview: George Carlin|newspaper=[[Playboy]]|author=Merrill, Sam|date=January 1982|postscript=&lt;!--None--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt; He grew up on West 121st Street, in a neighborhood of Manhattan he said he and his friends called "White [[Harlem]]" because that "sounded a lot tougher than its real name" of [[Morningside Heights, Manhattan|Morningside Heights]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = http://blogs.psychologytoday.com/blog/brainstorm/200806/george-carlins-last-interview | work =[[Psychology Today]] | title = George Carlin's last interview |first = Jay | last = Dixit | date = June 23, 2008 |accessdate=June 10, 2014}}{{dead link|date=December 2017|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}&lt;/ref&gt; He attended Corpus Christi School, a Roman Catholic parish school of the [[Corpus Christi Church (New York City)|Corpus Christi Church]] in Morningside Heights.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.georgecarlin.com/update_10-29-08/timeline/early_years.html |title=George Carlin: Early Years |publisher=George Carlin website (''georgecarlin.com'') |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090708072213/http://www.georgecarlin.com/update_10-29-08/timeline/early_years.html |archivedate=July 8, 2009 |accessdate=June 10, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last=Flegenheimer | first= Matt | url = http://cityroom.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/10/25/pondering-a-carlin-street-and-keeping-the-7-words-in-check/ | title = Carlin Street' Resisted by His Old Church.

He briefly attended [[Bishop Dubois High School]] in Harlem and the [[Salesians of Don Bosco|Salesian]] High School in [[Goshen, New York]].&lt;ref name=Gonzalez&gt;{{cite news |first=David |last=Gonzalez |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/06/24/nyregion/24hayes.html |title=George Carlin Didn't Shun School That Ejected Him |work=[[The New York Times]] |date=June 24, 2008 |accessdate=June 10, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; He spent many summers at Camp Notre Dame on [[Spofford Lake]] in [[Spofford, New Hampshire]], and regularly won the camp's drama award. Much later in life, he requested that a portion of his ashes be spread at the lake after his death.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nhtourguide.com/nh_facts.htm |title=Interesting, Strange &amp; Weird New Hampshire Facts |publisher=NHTourGuide.com |accessdate=June 12, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Carlin joined the [[United States Air Force]] and trained as a radar technician. He was stationed at [[Barksdale Air Force Base]] in [[Bossier City, Louisiana]]. He also began working as a disc jockey at radio station KJOE, in nearby [[Shreveport, Louisiana|Shreveport]]. Labeled an "unproductive airman" by his superiors, Carlin received a general discharge on July 29, 1957. During his time in the Air Force, he had been [[court-martial]]ed three times, and also received many nonjudicial punishments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://variety.com/2008/film/news/comedian-george-carlin-dies-at-71-1117987925/ |title=Comedian George Carlin dies at 71 |publisher=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]] |date=June 22, 2008 |accessdate=June 10, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Career ==
[[File:George Carlin Buddy Greco Away We Go 1967.JPG|thumb|right|180px|Carlin (right) with singer [[Buddy Greco]] in ''Away We Go'' (1967)]]
In 1959, Carlin met [[Jack Burns]], a fellow DJ at radio station [[KMNY|KXOL]] in [[Fort Worth, Texas]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.texasradiohalloffame.com/georgecarlin.html|title=Texas Radio Hall of Fame: George Carlin |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20040923044145/http://www.texasradiohalloffame.com/georgecarlin.html |archivedate=September 23, 2004 |accessdate=June 11, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; They formed a comedy team and after successful performances at Fort Worth's [[Beat Generation|beat]] coffeehouse called The Cellar, Burns and Carlin headed for California in February 1960.&lt;ref name="james7"/&gt;

Within weeks of arriving in California, Burns and Carlin put together an audition tape and created ''The Wright Brothers'', a morning show on [[KDAY]] in Hollywood. During their tenure at KDAY, they honed their material in [[beatnik]] coffeehouses at night.&lt;ref name=bio60s&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://www.georgecarlin.com/time/time3B.html |title=Timeline – 1960s |work=George Carlin Biography |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20000621020616/http://www.georgecarlin.com/time/time3B.html |archivedate=June 21, 2000 |accessdate=June 12, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Years later when he was honored with a star on the [[Hollywood Walk of Fame]], Carlin requested that it be placed in front of the KDAY studios near the corner of Sunset Boulevard and Vine Street.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kennedy-center.org/calendar/index.cfm?fuseaction=showIndividual&amp;entity_id=19830&amp;source_type=A|title=Biographical information for George Carlin|publisher=Kennedy Center|date=|accessdate=July 30, 2009|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090220184243/http://kennedy-center.org/calendar/index.cfm?fuseaction=showIndividual&amp;entity_id=19830&amp;source_type=A|archivedate=February 20, 2009|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Burns and Carlin recorded their only album, ''[[Burns and Carlin at the Playboy Club Tonight]]'', in May 1960 at Cosmo Alley in Hollywood.&lt;ref name=bio60s /&gt; After two years together as a team, they parted to pursue individual careers, but "remain[ed] the best of friends".&lt;ref&gt;Carlin, George (2009). Last Words. New York: Free Press, pp. 47–8. {{ISBN|1-4391-7295-1}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1960s, Carlin began appearing on television variety shows, where he played various characters:&lt;ref name=timeline /&gt;
* The Indian Sergeant&amp;nbsp;– "There will be a rain dance tonight ... weather permitting ..."
* Stupid disc jockeys ("Wonderful WINO radio ...")&amp;nbsp;– "The Beatles' latest record, when played backwards at slow speed, says, 'Dummy! You're playing it backwards at slow speed!'"
* Al Sleet, the Hippie-Dippie Weatherman&amp;nbsp;– "Tonight's forecast: Dark. Continued mostly dark tonight, changing to widely scattered light towards morning."

Variations on these routines appear on Carlin's 1967 debut album, ''[[Take-Offs and Put-Ons]]'', which was recorded live in 1966 at The Roostertail in [[Detroit|Detroit, Michigan]] and issued by [[RCA Victor]] in 1967.&lt;ref name=timeline&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.georgecarlin.com/home/home.html |title=George Carlin's official site (see Timeline) |publisher=Georgecarlin.com |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091008001351/http://www.georgecarlin.com/home/home.html |archivedate=October 8, 2009 |accessdate=June 10, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:George Carlin 1969.JPG|thumb|right|George Carlin in 1969]]
During this period, Carlin became a frequent performer and guest host on ''[[The Tonight Show]]'', initially with [[Jack Paar]] as host, then with [[Johnny Carson]]. Carlin became one of Carson's most frequent substitutes during the host's three-decade reign. Carlin was also cast in ''Away We Go'', a 1967 comedy show that aired on CBS.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0061235/fullcredits | title=Away We Go (1967– ) Full Cast &amp; Crew | website=IMDb | access-date=June 18, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; His material during his early career and his appearance, which consisted of suits and short-cropped hair, had been seen as "conventional", particularly when contrasted with his later [[anti-establishment]] material.&lt;ref&gt;''[[ABC World News Tonight]]''; June 23, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

Carlin was present at [[Lenny Bruce]]'s arrest for obscenity. As the police began attempting to detain members of the audience for questioning, they asked Carlin for his identification. Telling the police he did not believe in government-issued IDs, he was arrested and taken to jail with Bruce in the same vehicle.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite episode|title=Profanity|episodelink=List of Bullshit! episodes|series=Penn &amp; Teller: Bullshit!|serieslink=Penn &amp; Teller: Bullshit!|network=[[Showtime (TV network)|Showtime]]|airdate=August 12, 2004|season=2|number=10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the late 1960s, Carlin was making about $250,000 annually.&lt;ref name=Zoglin/&gt; As a [[tax shelter]] he bought a private jet&amp;nbsp;– a twin-engine [[IAI Westwind|Aero Commander 1121 Jet Commander]]. Carlin hired pilots to fly him to various tour dates.&lt;ref name=Jet&gt;{{Cite book |title=Last Words |last=Carlin |first=George |author2=[[Tony Hendra]] |year=2009 |publisher=[[Free Press (publisher)|Free Press]] |isbn=978-1-4391-7295-7 |page=151 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=AEZ42cO2QboC&amp;pg=PT151 |accessdate=June 10, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:George Carlin In concert at the Zembo Mosque, Harrisburg, Pa.jpg|thumb|left|George Carlin in concert at [[Harrisburg, Pennsylvania]]]]
Eventually, Carlin changed his routines and his appearance. Carlin hired talent managers – Jeff Wald and Ron De Blasio – to help him reinvent his image, making him look more [[Hip (slang)|hip]] for a younger audience. Wald put Carlin into much smaller clubs such as [[The Troubadour, West Hollywood|The Troubadour]] in West Hollywood and [[The Bitter End]] in New York City. Wald says that Carlin's income was thus reduced by 90%, but his later career arc was greatly improved.&lt;ref name=Zoglin&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6xg1h5lBheQC&amp;pg=PT34 |pages=34–35 |last=Zoglin |first=Richard |title=Comedy at the Edge: How Stand-up in the 1970s Changed America |publisher=Bloomsbury Publishing |year=2008 |isbn=9781596919440 |accessdate=June 12, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1970, record producer [[Monte Kay]] formed the [[Little David Records]] subsidiary of Atlantic Records, with comedian [[Flip Wilson]] as co-owner.&lt;ref&gt;Sullivan 2010, p. 114.&lt;/ref&gt; Kay and Wilson signed Carlin away from RCA Records, and recorded a Carlin performance at [[Washington, D.C.]]'s [[The Cellar Door]] in May 1971—this was released as ''[[FM &amp; AM]]'' in January 1972. De Blasio was busy managing the fast-paced career of [[Freddie Prinze]], and was about to sign [[Richard Pryor]], so he released Carlin to Little David general manager Jack Lewis, who, like Carlin, was somewhat wild and rebellious.&lt;ref&gt;Sullivan 2010, p. 158.&lt;/ref&gt; Carlin lost some TV bookings by dressing strangely for a comedian of the time, wearing faded jeans and sporting long hair, a beard, and earrings at a time when clean-cut, well-dressed comedians were the norm. Using his own persona as a springboard for his new comedy, he was presented by [[Ed Sullivan]] in a performance of "The Hair Piece" and quickly regained his popularity as the public caught on to his sense of style.&lt;ref name="GoldmarkBio"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Goldmark|first1=Tony|title=George Carlin – Biography|url=http://www.amoeba.com/george-carlin/artist/146678/bio|website=Amoeba Music|accessdate=September 1, 2016|quote=He bridged these two sides of his persona with 'The Hair Piece,' a whimsical poem about public aversion to long hair that he performed on Ed Sullivan, effectively reintroducing and reinventing himself to America. FM &amp; AM went Gold, got him a gig at Carnegie Hall, and won the Grammy award for Best Comedy Album.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Starting in 1972, singer-songwriter [[Kenny Rankin]] was Carlin's label mate on Little David Records, and Rankin served many times as Carlin's musical guest or opening act during the early 1970s. The two flew together in Carlin's private jet; Carlin says that Rankin relapsed into using cocaine while on tour since Carlin had so much of the drug available.&lt;ref name=Jet/&gt;

The album ''[[FM &amp; AM]]'' proved very popular. It marked Carlin's change from mainstream to counterculture comedy. The "AM" side was an extension of Carlin's previous style, with zany but relatively clean routines parodying aspects of American life. The "FM" side introduced Carlin's new style, with references to marijuana and birth control pills, and a playful examination of the word "shit". In this manner, Carlin renewed a style of radical social commentary comedy that Lenny Bruce had pioneered in the late 1950s.&lt;ref name=Zoglin/&gt;

In this period Carlin perfected his well-known routine, "[[Seven dirty words|Seven Words You Can Never Say on Television]]", recorded on ''[[Class Clown]]''. On July 21, 1972, Carlin was arrested after performing this routine at [[Milwaukee]]'s [[Summerfest]] and charged with violating [[obscenity]] laws.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jsonline.com/story/index.aspx?id=626471|title=Carlin's naughty words still ring in officer's ears|author=Jim Stingl|publisher=[[Milwaukee Journal Sentinel]]|date=June 30, 2007|accessdate=March 23, 2008|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070929124942/http://www.jsonline.com/story/index.aspx?id=626471|archivedate=September 29, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; The case, which prompted Carlin to refer to the words for a time as "the Milwaukee Seven", was dismissed in December of that year; the judge declared that the language was indecent but Carlin had the freedom to say it as long as he caused no disturbance. In 1973, a man complained to the [[Federal Communications Commission]] after listening with his son to a similar routine, "Filthy Words", from ''[[Occupation: Foole]]'', broadcast one afternoon over [[WBAI]], a [[Pacifica Foundation]] FM radio station in New York City. Pacifica received a citation from the FCC for violating regulations that prohibit broadcasting "obscene" material. The [[Supreme Court of the United States|U.S. Supreme Court]] upheld the FCC action by a vote of 5 to 4, ruling that the routine was "indecent but not obscene" and that the FCC had authority to prohibit such broadcasts during hours when children were likely to be among the audience (''[[F.C.C. v. Pacifica Foundation]]'', 438 U.S. 726 (1978); the court documents contain a complete transcript of the routine).&lt;ref name="EFF"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://w2.eff.org/legal/cases/FCC_v_Pacifica/fcc_v_pacifica.decision |title=FCC vs. Pacifica Foundation |date=July 3, 1978 |publisher=[[Electronic Frontier Foundation]] |accessdate=June 12, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The controversy increased Carlin's fame. He eventually expanded the dirty-words theme with a seemingly interminable end to a performance (ending with his voice fading out in one HBO version, and accompanying the credits in the ''[[Carlin at Carnegie]]'' special for the 1982–83 season) and a set of 49 web pages organized by subject and embracing his "Incomplete List of Impolite Words".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.georgecarlin.com/dirty/2443.html |title=BBS – Incomplete List of Impolite Words |publisher=George Carlin |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120406052624/http://www.georgecarlin.com/dirty/2443.html |archivedate=April 6, 2012 |accessdate=June 12, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On stage, during a rendition of his "Dirty Words" routine, Carlin learned that his previous comedy album ''FM &amp; AM'' had won the Grammy. Midway through the performance on the album ''Occupation: Foole'', he can be heard thanking someone for handing him a piece of paper. He then exclaimed "Shit!" and proudly announced his win to the audience.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=55pfcmUzGhw#t=2355 |title=George Carlin – Occupation: Foole}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Carlin unexpectedly stopped performing regularly in 1976, when his career appeared to be at its height. For the next five years he rarely performed stand-up, although it was at this time that he began doing specials for HBO as part of its ''[[On Location (TV series)|On Location]]'' series; doing 14 specials, including 2008's ''It's Bad For Ya!''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.biography.com/people/george-carlin-9542307#comic-great |title=George Carlin stand up comedian does 14 specials for On Location |last= |first= |date= |publisher=[[Biography.com]] ([[FYI (TV network)|FYI]] / [[A&amp;E Networks]]) |accessdate= October 8, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; He later revealed that he had suffered the first of three [[myocardial infarction|heart attacks]] during this layoff period.&lt;ref name="bravo"&gt;{{cite episode|title=George Carlin|series=Inside the Actors Studio|serieslink=Inside the Actors Studio|network=[[Bravo (US TV channel)|Bravo TV]]|airdate=October 31, 2004|season=11|number=4}}&lt;/ref&gt; His first two HBO specials aired in 1977 and 1978.&lt;ref name="EssSplitsider2015"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Ess|first1=Ramsey|title=How George Carlin Changed comedy In His First HBO Special|url=http://splitsider.com/2015/04/how-george-carlin-changed-comedy-in-his-first-hbo-special/|website=Splitsider.com|accessdate=September 1, 2016|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20160617094322/http://splitsider.com/2015/04/how-george-carlin-changed-comedy-in-his-first-hbo-special/|archivedate=June 17, 2016 |date=April 24, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="LeveretteOttBuckley2009"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Leverette|first1=Marc|last2=Ott|first2=Brian L|last3=Buckley|first3=Cara Louise|title=It's Not TV: Watching HBO in the Post-Television Era|date=March 23, 2009|publisher=Routledge|isbn=9781135902742|page=128|url=https://www.routledge.com/Its-Not-TV-Watching-HBO-in-the-Post-Television-Era/Leverette-Ott-Buckley/p/book/9780415960380|accessdate=September 1, 2016|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160901182100/https://www.routledge.com/Its-Not-TV-Watching-HBO-in-the-Post-Television-Era/Leverette-Ott-Buckley/p/book/9780415960380|archivedate=September 1, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Loz carlinbd2.jpg|thumb|George Carlin at a book signing for ''[[Brain Droppings]]'' in [[New York City]] at [[Barnes &amp; Noble]]]]
In 1981, Carlin returned to the stage, releasing ''[[A Place for My Stuff]]'' and returning to HBO and New York City with the ''[[Carlin at Carnegie]]'' TV special, videotaped at [[Carnegie Hall]] and airing during the 1982–83 season. Carlin continued doing HBO specials every year or every other year over the following decade and a half. All of Carlin's albums from this time forward are from the HBO specials.{{citation needed|date=July 2014}}

He hosted ''SNL'' for the second time on November 10, 1984, this time appearing in several sketches.&lt;ref name="NBCSNL11101984"&gt;{{cite web|title=MONOLOGUE: GEORGE CARLIN RETURNS TO HOST SNL|url=http://www.nbc.com/saturday-night-live/video/george-carlin-monologue/n9279|website=NBC.com|accessdate=September 1, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Carlin began to achieve prominence as a film actor with a major supporting role in the 1987 comedy hit ''[[Outrageous Fortune (film)|Outrageous Fortune]]'', starring [[Bette Midler]] and [[Shelley Long]]; it was his first notable screen role after a handful of previous guest roles on television series. Playing drifter Frank Madras, the role poked fun at the lingering effect of the [[1960s counterculture]]. In 1989, he gained popularity with a new generation of teens when he was cast as Rufus, the time-traveling mentor of the title characters in ''[[Bill &amp; Ted's Excellent Adventure]]'', and reprised his role in the film sequel ''[[Bill and Ted's Bogus Journey]]'' as well as the first season of the [[Bill &amp; Ted's Excellent Adventures (1990 TV series)|cartoon series]]. He also played the role of "Mr Conductor" on the [[PBS]] show ''[[Shining Time Station]]'' and narrated the show's sequences of the American version of ''[[Thomas &amp; Friends]]'' from 1991 to 1995, replacing [[Ringo Starr]]. On the first day of the assignment, Carlin was cross about recording his narration without an audience, so the producers put a stuffed teddy bear in the booth.&lt;ref name=LAT&gt;{{cite web|last=Allcroft |first=Britt |url=http://www.latimes.com/news/opinion/sunday/commentary/la-oew-allcroft26-2008jun26,0,3849505.story |title=Los Angeles Times – "The George Carlin I knew" |work=Los Angeles Times |date=26 June 2008 |accessdate=5 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Also in 1991, Carlin had a major supporting role in the movie ''[[The Prince of Tides]]'', which starred [[Nick Nolte]] and [[Barbra Streisand]], portraying the gay neighbor of the main character's suicidal sister.&lt;ref name="Grimes1992"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Grimes|first1=William|authorlink=William Grimes (journalist)|title=George Carlin, Small but Amusing|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1992/01/21/news/george-carlin-small-but-amusing.html|website=New York Times|accessdate=September 1, 2016|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150526055649/http://www.nytimes.com/1992/01/21/news/george-carlin-small-but-amusing.html|archivedate=May 26, 2015 |date=January 21, 1992}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1993, Carlin began a weekly [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]] sitcom, ''[[The George Carlin Show]]'', playing New York City [[taxicab]] driver George O'Grady. &lt;!--He quickly included a variation of the "seven words" in the plot.--&gt; The show, created and written by ''[[The Simpsons]]'' co-creator [[Sam Simon]], ran 27 episodes through December 1995.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.georgecarlin.com/time/time3E.html |title=1990–1999 |publisher=GeorgeCarlin.com |date= |accessdate=July 30, 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090130011335/http://www.georgecarlin.com/time/time3E.html |archivedate=January 30, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In his final book, the posthumously published ''[[Last Words (book)|Last Words]]'', Carlin said about ''The George Carlin Show'', "I had a great time. I never laughed so much, so often, so hard as I did with cast members [[Alex Rocco]], [[Christopher Rich (actor)|Chris Rich]], [[Anthony Starke|Tony Starke]]. There was a very strange, very good sense of humor on that stage ... [but] I was incredibly happy when the show was canceled. I was frustrated that it had taken me away from my true work."&lt;ref&gt;''Last Words'', Simon &amp; Schuster, 2009'&lt;/ref&gt;

Carlin later explained that there were other, more pragmatic reasons for abandoning his acting career in favor of standup. In an interview for [[Esquire (magazine)|''Esquire'']] magazine in 2001, he said, "Because of my abuse of drugs, I neglected my business affairs and had large arrears with the IRS, and that took me eighteen to twenty years to dig out of. I did it honorably, and I don't begrudge them. I don't hate paying taxes, and I'm not angry at anyone, because I was complicit in it. But I'll tell you what it did for me: it made me a way better comedian. Because I had to stay out on the road and I couldn't pursue that movie career, which would have gone nowhere, and I became a really good comic and a really good writer."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.esquire.com/features/what-ive-learned/george-carlin-quotes-0102 |title=What I've Learned: George Carlin |publisher=Esquire.com |date=June 23, 2008 |author=Larry Getlen |accessdate=June 10, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Carlin was honored at the 1997 [[Aspen Comedy Festival]] with a retrospective, ''[[George Carlin: 40 Years of Comedy]]'', hosted by [[Jon Stewart]]. His first hardcover book, ''[[Brain Droppings]]'' (1997), sold nearly 900,000 copies and spent 40 weeks on the ''[[New York Times]]'' best-seller list.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kennedy-center.org/explorer/artists/?entity_id=19830|title=The Kennedy Center|accessdate=June 12, 2014|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131224111638/http://www.kennedy-center.org/explorer/artists/?entity_id=19830|archivedate=December 24, 2013|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2001, Carlin was given a [[Lifetime Achievement Award]] at the 15th Annual [[American Comedy Awards]].
In December 2003 Representative [[Doug Ose]] (R-California) introduced a bill (H.R. 3687) to outlaw the broadcast of Carlin's "seven dirty words",&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.congress.gov/bill/108th-congress/house-bill/3687|title=H.R.3687 - To amend section 1464 of title 18, United States Code, to provide for the punishment of certain profane broadcasts, and for other purposes.|last=|first=|date=December 8, 2003|website=congress.gov|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; including "compound use (including hyphenated compounds) of such words and phrases with each other or with other words or phrases, and other grammatical forms of such words and phrases (including verb, adjective, gerund, participle, and infinitive forms)". The bill omitted "tits", but included "asshole", which was not one of Carlin's original seven words. The bill was referred to the [[United States House Judiciary Subcommittee on the Constitution, Civil Rights, and Civil Liberties|House Judiciary Subcommittee on the Constitution]] in January 2004, where it was tabled.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Carlin performed regularly as a headliner in [[Las Vegas Valley|Las Vegas]], but in 2004 his run at the [[MGM Grand Las Vegas]] was terminated after an altercation with his audience. After a poorly received set, filled with dark references to suicide bombings and beheadings, Carlin complained that he could not wait to get out of "this fucking hotel" and Las Vegas; he wanted to go back east, he said, "where the real people are". He continued:

{{quote|People who go to Las Vegas, you've got to question their fucking intellect to start with. Traveling hundreds and thousands of miles to essentially give your money to a large corporation is kind of fucking moronic. That's what I'm always getting here is these kind of fucking people with very limited intellects.}}

When an audience member shouted "Stop degrading us!" Carlin responded "Thank you very much, whatever that was. I hope it was positive; if not, well, blow me." He was immediately fired, and soon thereafter his representative announced that he would begin treatment for alcohol and prescription painkiller addiction on his own initiative.&lt;ref name="tagreviewj"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.reviewjournal.com/lvrj_home/2004/Dec-04-Sat-2004/news/25407915.html |title=Dark Carlin |publisher=reviewjournal.com |date=December 4, 2004 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20041207042940/http://www.reviewjournal.com/lvrj_home/2004/Dec-04-Sat-2004/news/25407915.html |archivedate=December 7, 2004 |accessdate=June 12, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cnn.com/2004/SHOWBIZ/books/12/27/george.carlin/index.html? |title=George Carlin enters rehab |publisher=[[CNN]] |date=December 29, 2004 |accessdate=June 12, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Topics included suicide, [[natural disaster]]s, [[cannibalism]], [[genocide]], [[human sacrifice]], threats to [[civil liberties]] in the U.S., and the case for his theory that humans are inferior to other animals. At the first tour stop at the Tachi Palace Casino in [[Lemoore, California]] in February, Carlin mentioned that the appearance was his "first show back" after a six-week hospitalization for heart failure and [[pneumonia]].{{citation needed|date=July 2014}}

Carlin voiced a character in the 2006 [[Disney]]/[[Pixar]] animated feature ''[[Cars (film)|Cars]]''. The character, Fillmore, is an anti-establishment hippie [[VW Microbus]] with a [[psychedelic art|psychedelic]] paint job and the license plate "51237"&amp;nbsp;– Carlin's birthday. In 2007, Carlin voiced the wizard in ''[[Happily N'Ever After]]'', his last film.

Carlin's last HBO stand-up special, ''[[It's Bad for Ya]]'', aired live on March 1, 2008, from the [[Wells Fargo Center for the Arts]] in [[Santa Rosa, California]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/life/movies/dvd/2007-09-24-carlin-collection_N.htm |title=George Carlin reflects on 50 years (or so) of 'All My Stuff' |author=Wloszczyna, Susan |publisher=[[USA Today]] |date=September 24, 2007 |accessdate=June 12, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Themes included "American bullshit", rights, death, old age, and child rearing.

When asked on ''[[Inside the Actors Studio]]'' what turned him on, he responded, "Reading about language." When asked what made him proudest of his career, he said the number of his books that have been sold, close to a million copies.{{citation needed|date=July 2016}}

== Personal life ==
Carlin met Brenda Hosbrook in August 1960 while touring with Burns and Carlin in [[Dayton, Ohio]]. They were married at her parents' home in Dayton on June 3, 1961.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |title=Last Words |last=Carlin |first=George |author2=[[Tony Hendra]] |year=2009 |publisher=[[Free Press (publisher)|Free Press]] |isbn=978-1-4391-7295-7 |pages=89–92}}&lt;/ref&gt; The couple's only child, [[Kelly Carlin|Kelly]], was born on June 15, 1963.

In November 1997, Carlin met Sally Wade, a comedy writer based in Hollywood; Carlin described it as "love at first sight", but was hesitant to act on his feelings so soon after his wife's death.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |title=Last Words |last=Carlin |first=George |author2=[[Tony Hendra]] |year=2009 |publisher=[[Free Press (publisher)|Free Press]] |isbn=978-1-4391-7295-7 |pages=272}}&lt;/ref&gt; They eventually married on June 24, 1998, in a private, unregistered ceremony.

Carlin also criticized religion and mocked traditional oath affirmations on the Bible as "bullshit", "make believe", and "kid stuff".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Religion is bullshit |author=George Carlin |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6RT6rL2UroE |work=YouTube |format=video |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151016214138/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6RT6rL2UroE |archivedate=October 16, 2015 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, he warned, "Be happy, don't be proud, there's too much pride as it is.

==Death==
Carlin had a history of cardiac problems spanning three decades. These included three heart attacks (in 1978, 1982, and 1991), an [[Heart arrhythmia|arrhythmia]] requiring an [[Ablation of atrial fibrillation|ablation]] procedure in 2003, and a significant episode of heart failure in late 2005. He twice underwent [[angioplasty]] to unblock clogged arteries.&lt;ref&gt;Carlin, G. (2009). Last words.

For a number of years, Carlin had been compiling and writing his autobiography, to be released in conjunction with a one-man Broadway show tentatively titled ''New York City Boy''.

== Internet hoaxes ==
Many writings found on the internet have been falsely attributed to Carlin, including various joke lists, rants, and other pieces. The web site [[Snopes]], an online resource that debunks [[urban legend]]s and myths, has addressed these hoaxes. Many of them contain material that runs counter to Carlin's viewpoints; some are especially volatile toward racial groups, gays, women, the homeless, and other targets. Carlin was aware of these bogus emails and debunked them on his own web site, saying, "Here's a rule of thumb, folks: Nothing you see on the Internet is mine unless it comes from one of my albums, books, HBO specials, or appeared on my web site", and "It bothers me that some people might believe that I would be capable of writing some of this stuff." [[Weird Al Yankovic]] referenced these hoaxes in a line of his song "[[Alpocalypse#Track listing|Stop Forwarding That Crap to Me]]" by saying "And by the way, those quotes from George Carlin aren't really George Carlin".&lt;ref&gt;

"'''Go God Go'''" is the twelfth episode in the [[South Park (season 10)|tenth season]] of the American animated television series ''[[South Park]]''. The 151st episode of the series overall, it originally aired on [[Comedy Central]] in the United States on November 1, 2006. The episode is the first in a two-part story arc, which concludes with "[[Go God Go XII]]". 

In "Go God Go", [[Eric Cartman|Cartman]] is unable to wait the three weeks until the [[Wii]] video game console is released, and attempts to [[Cryonics|freeze himself]] to get closer to the release date, but accidentally ends up much later in the future, in the [[Atheism|atheistic]] world of 2546. Meanwhile, Ms. Garrison is forced to teach evolution to her students.

The episode was written and directed by ''South Park'' co-creator [[Trey Parker]]. The episode is a satire on [[atheism]] and mocks evolutionist [[Richard Dawkins]], as well some arguments against religion.

==Plot==
[[Eric Cartman|Cartman]] is unable to wait three weeks until the [[Wii|Nintendo Wii]] console is released. In an attempt to enter [[Cryonics|cryonic suspension]], he buries himself in the snow at the top of [[Mount Elbert]], with help from [[Butters Stotch|Butters]].

Concurrently, [[Mr. Garrison|Mrs. Garrison]] resists being forced to teach the school's [[evolution]] curriculum. In response, the school hires evolutionary biologist [[Richard Dawkins]] to present the evolution lesson. After some initial friction between the creationist Garrison and atheist Dawkins, a romantic interest soon develops. During their date, Dawkins refers to religion as an [[argument from ignorance]], and Garrison announces that she is now an atheist. The two later have [[sexual intercourse|sex]], and Garrison pushes Dawkins to the realization it is his duty to rid the world of religion and bring about peace with its abolition. Garrison begins to admonish students who express a belief in god, mocking that they likely believe in the [[Flying Spaghetti Monster]].

By this time, Cartman enters suspended animation, and a freak avalanche has buried his body. Cartman ultimately remains frozen for over five centuries, until being discovered and thawed out by members of the Unified Atheist League (UAL). In the year 2546, the entire world is atheistic and dedicated to rationality and science. Atheism is divided into several [[Religious denomination|denominations]]. These factions are at war with each other over who has the right answer to "the great question".

Cartman is informed of the possible presence of a Nintendo Wii at the Museum of Technology in New New Hampshire. However, they mention that before they are willing to take him there, they require some information alluding to a person they believe he knew in his time: the founder of the UAL who helped initiate a great event that made the entire world atheist. Suddenly, the UAL comes under attack from a rival group, the United Atheist Alliance (UAA), and Cartman is taken captive aboard a UAA ship.

The UAA commander contacts yet another faction, the Allied Atheist Allegiance (AAA), who are made up solely of highly evolved [[sea otter]]s. The Commander of the UAA boasts to the otters about their possession of Cartman, and of how because of this, they are now the atheists in control. This provokes a threatening response from the AAA.

==Production==
Series co-creators [[Trey Parker]] and [[Matt Stone]] described the production of "Go God Go" and "Go God Go XII" as "painful", mainly because of how it deals with atheism. They spoke about how difficult it is to make such a subject humorous without seeming "preachy". For a time, the episode actually did end up feeling "preachy" because too many ideas and statements were present. To rectify this, large portions of the episodes that more reflected Parker and Stone's personal opinions were removed and replaced with less serious material.&lt;ref name="Commentary"&gt;{{cite video | people=[[Trey Parker|Parker, Trey]]; [[Matt Stone|Stone, Matt]]|date=2006|title=South Park season ten DVD commentary for the episode "Go God Go"| medium=DVD|publisher=[[Comedy Central]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Commentary 2"&gt;{{cite video | people=[[Trey Parker|Parker, Trey]]; [[Matt Stone|Stone, Matt]]|date=2006|title=South Park season ten DVD commentary for the episode "[[Go God Go XII]]"| medium=DVD|publisher=[[Comedy Central]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The decision to do an episode with the theme of atheism was finalized when [[Penn Jillette]] emailed Parker and Stone expressing his disappointment in finding out that they are not atheists themselves. Parker and Stone's religion was questioned in an interview, which prompted Jillette's email. It was assumed that they were atheists, so in the interview they clarified that they were not strictly atheists. While this was happening, Parker was anticipating the release of the [[Nintendo Wii]], so it was decided that this scenario would also be a theme in the episode.&lt;ref name="Commentary"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Commentary 2"/&gt;

At the end of "Go God Go", Cartman is sent to the future; Parker and Stone loved the idea, in-part because it presented the opportunity for easy-to-write material. However, they had essentially forced themselves to create another episode, which they partially disliked because it meant they'd have to write more material that concerns atheism when they felt they had done enough.&lt;ref name="Commentary"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Commentary 2"/&gt;

Several aspects of both "Go God Go" and "Go God Go XII" pay homage to ''[[Buck Rogers in the 25th Century (TV series)|Buck Rogers in the 25th Century]]'', a science fiction adventure television series produced by [[Universal Studios]]. [[Richard Dawkins]] and his book ''[[The God Delusion]]'' is also parodied. Parker and Stone were very pleased with the work of the animation staff in regards to the designs of the scenes in the future, particularly praising them for accomplishing so much in the short amount of time that a ''South Park'' episode is produced.&lt;ref name="Commentary"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Commentary 2"/&gt;

==Reception==

===Critical response===
Dan Iverson of ''[[IGN]]'' gave the episode a positive review, with a score of 9.0 out of 10, writing: "Between the shocking Mrs. Garrison story and the hilarious Wii promotion by Cartman, we totally recommend watching this episode."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Dan Inverson |url=http://ign.com/articles/2006/11/02/south-park-go-god-go-part-2-review |title=South Park: "Go, God. Go! Part 2" Review |publisher=IGN |date=2006-11-02 |accessdate=2017-06-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Nintendo's response===
The week of November 5, 2006, a poll on Nintendo.com asked "How bad do you want a Wii?". The responses were "Bad", "Way Bad", and "Worse than Cartman", with the third choice receiving 80% of the votes.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/19990508065357/http://www.nintendo.com/home/ ''Nintendo.com Home Page 2006-11-07'']&lt;/ref&gt; At Nintendo's 2007 [[Electronic Entertainment Expo]] press conference, a clip of the episode where Cartman tells his mother he must have a Wii was included in a montage of clips about the demand for the Wii.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gamespot.com/articles/e3-07-wii-mario-kart-pulls-drive-by-on-nintendo-gathering/1100-6174021/ |title=E3 '07: Wii Mario Kart pulls drive-by on Nintendo gathering |publisher=GameSpot |date=2007-08-30 |accessdate=2017-06-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nintendo also sent the ''South Park'' staff several free Wii consoles after the episode first aired.&lt;ref name="Commentary"/&gt;

===Richard Dawkins' response===
[[File:Dawkinssouthpark.jpg|thumb|Richard Dawkins was critical of his depiction in the two-parter.]]
[[Richard Dawkins]] reacted to the two-part episode by saying, "I'm buggered if I like being portrayed as a cartoon character buggering a bald transvestite. I wouldn't have minded so much if only it had been in the service of some serious point, but if there was a serious point in there I couldn't discern it."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=National |url=http://www.smh.com.au/national/the-diary/scientist-parks-trannie-sex-jibe-20100303-pj4j.html |title=Scientist parks trannie sex jibe |publisher=Smh.com.au |date=2010-03-04 |accessdate=2017-06-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a Q&amp;A session at the Free Library of Philadelphia, Dawkins said: "I would have thought they could at least have got an actor that could do a proper [[British English|British accent]]. Now, if only I could be offered a [[cameo appearance|cameo role]] in ''[[The Simpsons]]'', I could show that actor how to do a real British accent."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://richarddawkins.net/tourJournal |title=RichardDawkins.net - The Official Richard Dawkins Website |publisher=Web.archive.org |date= |accessdate=2017-06-11 |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061117145408/http://richarddawkins.net/tourJournal#11 |archivedate=2006-11-17 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Dawkins later made a cameo in ''The Simpsons'' episode "[[Black-Eyed, Please]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tvequals.com/2013/03/10/the-simpsons-season-24-review-black-eyed-please/ |title=The Simpsons Season 24 Review "Black-eyed Please" |publisher=TV Equals |date= |accessdate=2013-03-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When asked about the episode in a 2012 interview with ''[[Playboy]]'' magazine, Dawkins, who said it was the only episode of ''South Park'' he had seen, thought the fighting among the different atheist sects had "a certain amount of truth in it" and harbored a greater potential for satire. It reminded him of the Judean People's Front and the People's Front of Judea from the film ''[[Monty Python’s Life of Brian]]'', but felt that too much of the episode was devoted to ridiculing him by depicting him having sex with Ms. Garrison. He commented, "That isn't satire because it has nothing to do with what I stand for. And the [[scatological]] part, where they had somebody throwing shit, which stuck to my forehead—that’s not even funny."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Chip Rowe |url=http://www.playboy.com/playground/view/playboy-interview-richard-dawkins |title=Interview: Richard Dawkins |publisher=Playboy |date=2012-08-20 |accessdate=2017-06-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Hell, etc.''' was [[Marilyn Manson]]'s third [[art exhibition]], held in [[Athens]], [[Greece]]. The exhibition was opened to the public from April 28, 2010 until May 2, 2010. Manson's more recent artworks and newly revealed pieces, of the time, were displayed.

==Background==
The art exhibition was scheduled to run from April 21, 2010, until April 25, 2010, however due to the volcanic ash cloud was postponed to begin on April 28, 2010, and be open from that date until May 2, 2010. This was correctly reported by [http://new.e-go.gr/exodos/article.asp?catid=6472&amp;subid=2&amp;pubid=7812548 E-Go.Gr].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.providermodule.com/marilyn_manson_news.php?fn_mode=fullnews&amp;fn_id=94 E-Go.Gr update on Hell, etc. by Marilyn Manson. Art exhibition postponed due volcanic ash.]&lt;/ref&gt;

The exhibition was held at the Athenian Cultural Centre. The exhibition opened at 10:00 daily and was open until 22:00. Flash photography was prohibited inside the exhibition, as the watercolor paintings were extremely sensitive to the [[Flash (photography)|flash]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mansonwiki.com/wiki/Hell,_etc._(exhibition) Information of the Hell, etc. art exhibition.]&lt;/ref&gt;

People often see '''hidden faces''' in things.  Depending on the circumstances, this is referred to as [[pareidolia]], the perception or recognition of a specific pattern or form in something essentially different.  It is thus also a kind of [[optical illusion]].  When an artist notices that two different things have a similar appearance, and draws or paints a picture making this similarity evident he makes images with double meanings. Many of these images are hidden faces or hidden skulls.

These illusionistic pictures present the viewer with a mental choice of two interpretations: head or landscape, head or objects, head or architecture, etc. Both of them are valid, but the viewer sees only one of them and very often he cannot see both interpretations simultaneously.

There are everyday examples of hidden faces, they are "chance images" including faces in the clouds, figures of the [[Rorschach Test]] and the [[Man in the Moon]]. [[Leonardo da Vinci]] wrote about them in his notebook: "If you look at walls that are stained or made of different kinds of stones you can think you see in them certain picturesque views of mountains, rivers, rocks, trees, plains, broad valleys, and hills of different shapes. You can also find in them battles and rapidly moving figures, strange faces and costumes, as well as an infinite number of things." [[Francois and Jean Robert]] collected and published a lot of photos of "chance faces".{{clear}}

The Mannerist master at the 16th-century imperial Habsburg courts of Vienna and Prague, [[Giuseppe Arcimboldo]] of [[Milan]] was probably the best known artist for creating extraordinary hidden faces.  He arranged flowers, vegetables, fruits, shells, scallops and other animals, books and different things on the canvas in such a way that the whole collection of objects formed a portrait. His series of The Four Seasons seems to be the first use of this approach and technique. Arcimboldo's composite heads were celebrated and imitated by his contemporaries but they were relatively forgotten until participants in the twentieth-century art movements rediscovered them, bringing them to the attention of art historians. He is considered as forerunner of [[Dada]] and [[Surrealism]].{{cn|date=October 2018}}

Some other famous [[Renaissance]] and [[Baroque]] artists created hidden faces:{{cn|date=October 2018}}
*[[Leonardo da Vinci]]
*[[Albrecht Dürer]]
*[[Tobias Stimmer]]
*[[Hans Holbein the Younger]]
*[[Matthäus Merian]]
*[[Anna Maria Sibylla Merian]]
*[[Marcus Gheeraerts the Elder]]
*[[Wenzel Hollar]]
*[[Josse de Momper]]

[[Salvador Dalí]] was fascinated by the technique of Arcimboldo and his paranoia-critical method was influenced by the [[Mannerist]] painter. For Dalí the Arcimboldo effect was form of self concealment as well as this exhibitionist painter seemed, all throughout his life of constant posturing, to hide his [[real self]] behind the gaudy externals of his behaviour. Larvatus prodeo, "I wear a mask," he could have said with Descartes and he used this quotation from the French philosopher for the epigraph of his novel ''Hidden Faces''.{{cn|date=October 2018}} Probably his most famous "hidden face" is [[Voltaire]] in his oil painting: "Slave Market with the Disappearing Bust of Voltaire".
Other [[Surrealist]] painters rediscovered the technique of hidden faces in the first part of 20th century: 
*[[Max Ernst]]{{cn|date=October 2018}}
*[[René Magritte]]{{cn|date=October 2018}}

[[Istvan Orosz]] tries to combine the technique of [[anamorphosis]] with the hidden faces. 
Anamorphosis is used for those works of art that were made as distorted and unrecognizable through clever geometrical constructions. But when viewed from a certain point, or through a reflecting object placed upon it, the hidden image appears in its true shape, that is, it goes through retransformation. 
Orosz made experiments with anamorphoses not only in resurrecting the old technique but to improve and develop it. Instead of having a meaningless distorted image, his intent is to bring sense to the basic anamorphic picture, giving it meaning in itself with its second reading being revealed by viewing it from a different viewpoint such as looking at it through a special mirror.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.gallery-diabolus.com/gallery/upload/utisz/Verne00.jpg |title=Anamorphosis with double meanings: landscape and portrait of Jules Verne in the mirror cylinder |publisher=gallery-diabolus.com |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927070312/http://www.gallery-diabolus.com/gallery/upload/utisz/Verne00.jpg |archivedate=2007-09-27 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
The ambiguous layers coming up by this approach make use of the connection or contrast of the two images within the same picture being independent from each other.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gallery-diabolus.com/gallery/upload/utisz/shakespeareszinhaz.jpg |title=Anamorphosis with double meanings: a theatre and portrait of William Shakespeare.

'''Hop-o'-My-Thumb''' (Hop-on-My-Thumb), or '''Hop o' My Thumb''', also known as '''Little Thumbling''', '''Little Thumb''', or '''Little Poucet''' ({{lang-fr|Le petit Poucet}}), is one of the eight [[fairytales]] published by [[Charles Perrault]] in ''[[Histoires ou Contes du temps passé]]'' (1697), now world-renowned.&lt;ref&gt;[[Iona and Peter Opie|Opie, Iona and Peter]]. ''The Classic Fairy Tales''. [[Oxford University Press]], 1974, p. 21.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bottigheimer, Ruth. (2008). "Before ''Contes du temps passe'' (1697): Charles Perrault's ''Griselidis'', ''Souhaits'' and ''Peau''". ''The Romantic Review'', Volume 99, Number 3, pp. 175-189.&lt;/ref&gt; It is [[Aarne-Thompson classification system|Aarne-Thompson]] type 327B. The small boy defeats the [[ogre]].&lt;ref&gt;Heiner, Heidi Anne. [http://www.surlalunefairytales.com/hopomythumb/other.html "Tales Similar to Hop o' My Thumb"].&lt;/ref&gt; This type of fairytale, in the French oral tradition, is often combined with motifs from the type 327A, similar to ''[[Hansel and Gretel]]''; one such tale is ''[[The Lost Children (French fairy tale)|The Lost Children]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Delarue, Paul. ''The Borzoi Book of French Folk-Tales''. Alfred A. Knopf, Inc., New York, 1956, p. 365.&lt;/ref&gt;

The story was first published in English as ''Little Poucet'' in [[Robert Samber]]'s 1729 translation of Perrault's book, "''Histories, or Tales of Past Times''". In 1764, the name of the hero was changed to ''Little Thumb''. In 1804, [[William Godwin]], in "''Tabart's Collection of Popular Stories for the Nursery''", retitled it ''Hop o' my Thumb'', a term that was common in the 16th century, referring to a tiny person.&lt;ref&gt;[[Iona and Peter Opie|Opie, Iona and Peter]]. ''The Classic Fairy Tales''. [[Oxford University Press]], 1974, p. 129.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Summary==
Hop-o'-My-Thumb ({{lang|fr|le petit Poucet}}) is the youngest of seven children in a poor woodcutter's family. His greater wisdom compensates for his smallness of size. When the children are abandoned by their parents, he finds a variety of means to save his life and the lives of his brothers. After being threatened and pursued by an [[ogre]], Poucet steals his magic [[seven-league boots]] while the monster is sleeping.

==Plot==
[[Image:Poucet1.JPG|thumb|Illustration by [[Gustave Doré]], from ''Les Contes de Perrault'' (1862), depicting Hop-o'-My-Thumb hiding under a stool, listening to his parents as they discuss abandoning him and his brothers.]]

The parents are no longer able to support their children and intend to abandon them. Hop-o'-My-Thumb, overhearing his parents, plans ahead and collects small white pebbles from a river. He uses the stones to mark a trail that enables him to successfully lead his brothers back home. However, the second time round, he uses breadcrumbs instead, which the birds eat up.

The brothers are lost in the wood. Hop-o'-My-Thumb climbs up a tree and spots a distant light. The boys walk towards it. They come at last to a house, and learn that it belongs to an ogre. Hop-o'-My-Thumb, fearing the wolves, decides to take the risk of staying in the monster's residence.

The ogre allows the boys to sleep for the night, and provides a bed for them in his daughters' room. But the ogre wakes up not too long after, and prepares to kill them in their slumber. Hop-o'-My-Thumb, who anticipated the possibility, already planned ahead and replaced the daughters' gold crowns with the bonnets worn by him and his brothers. As a result, the ogre kills his daughters instead, and goes back to bed. Once he is snoring, Hop-o'-My-Thumb directs his siblings out of the house.

The ogre wakes up in the morning to discover his grave mistake, puts on his seven-league boots, and races after the boys. They spot the ogre while walking. Hop-o'-My-Thumb once again thinks fast and hides in a small nearby cave. The ogre, who is tired, happens to rest close to their hiding spot. Hop-o'-My-Thumb instructs his brothers to make their way home, and meanwhile, removes the boots from the sleeping ogre. He puts them on, and the boots, being magical, resize to fit him.

Hop-o'-My-Thumb uses the boots to make a fortune, and returns to his family's home, where they live happily ever after.

==History and analysis==
[[Image:Clouzier - 1697 - Le Petit Poucet.png|thumb|Illustration to "Le petit Poucet" from the first edition of Perrault's book (1697), showing Hop-o'-My-Thumb pulling the sleeping ogre's boots off.]]

The French folktale was first published by [[Charles Perrault]] as ''Le petit Poucet'' in ''[[Histoires ou contes du temps passé]]'' in 1697. The French name for the hero, "Poucet" [Poo-seh], derives from the French word "pouce" [pooss], which means "thumb", "big toe", or "inch". The suffix "-t" gives it an affectionate touch, given the morphemes of the language.

The beginning mentions that "le petit Poucet" was no bigger than a man's thumb when he was born. However, it seems that for the remainder of the story, the protagonist is just a small child, and the tale bears no resemblance to ''[[Tom Thumb]]''. As is the nature of traditional stories, passed on orally, the beginning passage might be a remnant from an older tale, ancestral to both ''Hop-o'-My-Thumb'' and ''Tom Thumb''.

The first half of ''Hop-o'-My-Thumb'' is very similar to ''Hansel and Gretel''. The parents are no longer able to support their children and abandon them. The hero lays a trail of breadcrumbs, which thanks to the birds, does not help him get back home. Such laying of trail is found in many stories, one of the oldest being ''[[Theseus#The_myth_of_Theseus_and_the_Minotaur|Theseus and the Minotaur]]''.

The second half of the story involves an ogre, which the hero outsmarts. It bears resemblance to ''[[Sweetheart Roland]]'' and ''[[Themisto]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[[Iona and Peter Opie|Opie, Iona and Peter]]. ''The Classic Fairy Tales''. [[Oxford University Press]], 1974, pp. 128-129.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''IFAN''' ('''I.F.A.N.''', '''Institut fondamental d'Afrique noire''' or '''African Institute of Basic research''') is a cultural and scientific institute in the nations of the former [[French West Africa]].  Founded in [[Dakar]], [[Senegal]] in 1938 as the '''Institut français d’[[Sub-Saharan Africa|Afrique noire]]''' (the name was changed only in 1966), it was headquartered in what is now the building of the [[IFAN Museum of African Arts]].  Its charge was to study the language, history, and culture of the peoples ruled by [[French colonial empires|French colonialism]] in Africa.

==Early history==
IFAN first formed from a combination of three forces: the French colonial "[[Civilizing mission]]", the desire for more efficient [[Indirect rule]] through the understanding of African cultures, and research into the resources of the French dominion in Africa.&lt;ref&gt;See: David Robinson. Paths of accommodation: Muslim societies and French colonial authorities in Senegal and Mauritania, 1880-1920, Athens, Ohio University Press (2000) {{ISBN|0-8214-1353-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Governors General [[Ernest Roume]] (1902–1908) and [[William Ponty]] (1908–1914) oversaw a reorganization of the French higher educational system in the colonies, and placing [[Georges Hardy]] in charge, moved the colonial administration into a model which used elements from both a "Direct", [[Assimilation (French colonial)|Assimilationist]] policy and an [[Indirect rule|Indirect]], rule by African proxy policy.  The first required educational resources be created provided for the small minority of "''assimilated''" Africans, while the later required French colonial administrators be educated in the workings of African societies.  To these ends, Hardy oversaw the creation of the  [[École normale supérieure William Ponty]] (under the administration of [[Joseph Clozel]]), the publication ''Bulletin de l'Enseigement en AOF'', and the ''Comite d'etudes historiques et scientifiques de l'AOF'' (1918).  This last, immensely successful as a scientific journal, inaugurated  what one historian has called an era of "..knowledge and control." &lt;ref&gt;Robinson, ibid, (p.69 in French language edition, 2004, {{ISBN|2-84586-485-X}} )&lt;/ref&gt;

These imperial (or at best [[paternalist]]) scientific tools were turned on their head in a number of ways.  First, the African higher education system (and the École William Ponty in particular) became the incubator for the political leaders of the independence movement.  The study of African cultures, though invaluable to modern historians, did little to legitimize French rule through their [[Chefs du Canton]], but it did provide Francophone West Africans (such as [[Léopold Senghor]]) with the materials to bolster their sense of cultural importance, as demonstrated in the [[Negritude]] movement.  Finally, Europeans and Africans who opposed colonial rule came together in the years after the founding of IFAN in Dakar. IFAN was first conceived as an integration of various French colonial research systems in the early 1930s, and the vision was one of putting science to the service of the colonial project.&lt;ref&gt;Jacques Galliard quotes a publication from the early 30s:&lt;blockquote&gt;It is for us a sort of intellectual duty and a requirement of colonial honour to study the countries that we must administer and the people that we must educate and protect. This is, in part, one of the strongest justifications for colonisation, and it cannot be defined in material and economic terms . . . . The establishment of African science is indeed an exigency of our colonial policy (IFAN, 1961: 37).&lt;/blockquote&gt; Jacques Gaillard. [http://ahero.uwc.ac.za/index.php?module=cshe&amp;action=downloadfile&amp;fileid=81806115512041001233965 "The Senegalese Scientific Community: Africanization, Dependence and Crisis"] in ''Scientific communities in the developing world''. Jacques Gaillard, V.V. Krishna and Roland Waast(eds). New Delhi, Thousand Oaks, Calif., and London: Sage Publications, 1997.&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Jules Brévié]], governor of [[French West Africa]] from 1930 to 1936, wrote that "colonization needs scholars, impartial and disinterested researchers with broad vision, outside of the urgency and fire of action. He wanted a methodical research program into colonial history and African culture, and lobbied for an official scientific institute to undertake geographical, ethnographic and historical research.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|page=70 |last=Wilder|first=Gary|title=The French Imperial Nation-State: Negritude and Colonial Humanism Between the Two World Wars |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=hLqOeLn2MfcC&amp;pg=PA70|accessdate=2015-10-27 |date=2005-12-01|publisher=University of Chicago Press|isbn=978-0-226-89768-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Popular Front government, in 1936, converted the ''Comite d'etudes historiques et scientifiques de l'AOF'' into the Dakar-based IFAN, and placed naturalist [[Théodore Monod]] at its head.
From the opening of the institute in 1938, Monod sought to promote Africans into positions of authority in IFAN, such as ethnologist [[Amadou Hampâté Bâ]].  With the end of the [[Second World War]], an influx of African intellectuals and French radicals (such as [[Jean Suret-Canale]]) found homes in IFAN and its branches, some taking part in political agitation through organisations like the [[Popular Front (Senegal)|Senegalese Popular Front]], the [[African Democratic Rally|RDA]], and the [[Communist Study Groups]] of the 1940s.

As independence loomed in the 1950s, IFAN became an increasingly African institution.  It formed a parallel [[National Archives]] to the Archives of the Governor General in Dakar,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.archivesdusenegal.gouv.sn/biblio.html Les Archives Nationales du Sénégal: La Bibliothèque, Présentation] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120901172440/http://www.archivesdusenegal.gouv.sn/biblio.html |date=2012-09-01 }}. "l'arrêté 4803 du 24 novembre 1947 qui faisait de l'IFAN le dépositaire du dépôt légal".&lt;/ref&gt; with Monod and the IFAN answering directly to the [[Minister of Overseas France]] - a rare degree of autonomy under the [[French West Africa|AOF]] system. By independence IFAN had offices in [[Saint-Louis, Senegal|Saint-Louis]], [[Abidjan]], [[Bamako]], [[Cotonou]], [[Niamey]], [[Ouagadougou]], associated centers in [[Douala]] and [[Lomé]], and permanent scientific research stations in [[Atar]], [[Diafarabé]], and [[Mont-Nimba]]. The 1940s and 50s saw more such projects undertaken, such as the 1943 ''Office of Colonial Scientific Research'' (Now the ORSTOM Soil Research Centre in Dakar-Hann) and the [[University of Dakar]] in 1957.  Each of these institutions, begun as colonial instruments, evolved with the coming of independence into African tools to meet African needs.&lt;ref&gt;See J. Galliard, Passim.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Independence==
By independence in 1960 IFAN had branches across French West Africa, in all the cities which were to become the capitals of independent states.  The Dakar IFAN was transferred to [[Cheikh Anta Diop University]] in 1960, and Monod was kept on as director until 1965. In 1986 it was officially renamed "''IFAN Cheikh Anta Diop''", and maintains budgets, administration and staff independent of the university. It is today one of the most prestigious centers for the study of African culture in the world. As the main cultural research center of the colonies of French West Africa, it contains important collections from across Francophone Africa.  Most branches of IFAN, notably in [[Conakry]] ([[Guinea]]), [[Abidjan]] ([[Cote d'Ivoire]]), and [[Bamako]] ([[Mali]]), became the basis for national archives and research centers. Some still retain the "IFAN" title. The IFAN of [[French Soudan|Soudan Francais]] became the [[National Museum of Mali]], while IFAN of [[French Guinea]] became the ''Institut National de Recherche et Documentation'': the National Library, Archives and Museum of [[Guinea]].

==Publishing==
IFAN publishes a number of academic journals. ''Mémoire de l'IFAN'' and ''{{illm|Bulletin de l'Institut Fondamental d'Afrique Noire|fr}}'' (abbreviated ''BIFAN'')  mostly deal with [[linguistics]], [[anthropology]], history and [[archeology]].&lt;ref&gt;See the bibliographical essay on pp.304-305 of &lt;br /&gt;Peter Duignan, Lewis H. Gann, Victor Witter. ''Colonialism in Africa'', 1870-1960. Cambridge University Press (1975) {{ISBN|0-521-07859-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The Centre de Linguistique Appliquée de Dakar, in conjunction with IFAN, has published extensive work on the [[Languages of Africa]], notably the multi-volume ''Lexique Wolof-Français''.  Other sections of IFAN have published collections on everything from the fish to the dance of the West African region.

==Interlochen Arts Academy==
{{unreferenced section|date=June 2015}}
The '''Interlochen Arts Academy''' (IAA), the highest profile pre-professional arts boarding school worldwide, was founded in 1962 by Joseph E. Maddy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.interlochen.org/content/founding|title=Our Founding|website=www.interlochen.org|access-date=2016-06-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; {{As of|2016}}, it had 350 faculty and staff, and approximately 500 students. Admission is by audition only. While more than half the students major are in Music Performance, IAA offers majors in Comparative Arts, Creative Writing, Dance, Theatre (Performance; Design and Production), Motion Picture Arts, and Visual Arts. Newer majors include Motion Picture Arts beginning in 2005,and Comparative Arts in 2011) The vast majority of students at Interlochen Arts Academy are boarding students, including many international students; some are day students who live in the vicinity.

Prior to directional changes led by President Kimpton and beginning in 2009-2010, only 8% of students attended Interlochen Arts Academy for a freshman year, followed by 20% of students for a sophomore year.{{Citation needed|date=June 2016}} This was due to the school's boarding feature and competitive entrance auditions. With the addition of new majors, IAA has attempted to increase the number of students attending all four years.

IAA also offers a postgraduate year for further pre-professional study.

Upon graduation, most IAA graduates continue to universities or conservatories for further study in the arts or academics. Conservatories that often admit Interlochen students include [[Juilliard]], [[Eastman School of Music|Eastman]], [[Cleveland Institute of Music]] (CIM), [[School of the Art Institute of Chicago]], [[Curtis Institute of Music|Curtis]], [[New England Conservatory]] (NEC), [[Oberlin Conservatory]], [[Manhattan School of Music]], [[Boston Conservatory]], [[Peabody Institute]], and [[CalArts]]. Interlochen Arts Academy graduates also matriculate at colleges and universities that do not have a primary focus on the arts.

Due to its reputation and secluded location, Interlochen Arts Academy has attracted many celebrity offspring, including children of [[Robin Williams]], [[Hugh Hefner]], [[Bruce Willis]], [[Demi Moore]], and [[Alan Menken]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://mynorth.com/2017/07/from-interlochen-to-the-world-famous-alums |title= From Interlochen to the World, Famous Alums Reflect }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
[[File:Interlochen ca1940s LC 8d07694v.jpg|thumb|Interlochen in the 1940s]]
From the State of Michigan historical marker on Interlochen's Osterlin Mall:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.michmarkers.com/Pages/S0225.htm |title=Michigan Historical Marker: Interlochen |work=MichMarkers.com |date= |accessdate=2009-10-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;[[Ottawa (tribe)|Ottawa Indians]] once lived in the pine forest between lakes Wahbekaness and Wahbekanetta. In the late 1800s white men came and cut the pines, leaving only a small forest between the lakes. This virgin pine was purchased in 1917 by the state and became part of one of the first state parks. When the lumber era ended, the Wylie Cooperage mill occupied the Indian village site, making barrels until the hardwood ran out. Willis Pennington's summer hotel, opened in 1909, was popular with fishermen until automobiles and better roads drew them elsewhere. Then in 1918, '''Camp Interlochen''', one of Michigan's first girls' recreation camps, was opened, followed in 1922 by '''Camp Penn Loch''' for boys. In 1928, by arrangement with Willis Pennington, [[Joseph E. Maddy]] and Thaddeus P. Giddings established the '''National High School Orchestra Camp'''. It grew rapidly in scope, size, and reputation, becoming the '''National Music Camp''' in 1931, and affiliating with the [[University of Michigan]] in 1942. '''Interlochen Arts Academy''' was chartered in 1960 to provide year-round training in the creative arts.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

From the book ''Interlochen, The First 25 Years'':
&lt;blockquote&gt;In 1926, Joe Maddy was asked to organize and conduct the First National High School Orchestra for the Music Supervisors' National Conference (now known as the [[MENC: The National Association for Music Education|Music Educators National Conference]]) in [[Detroit]]. Its resounding success led to an invitation to duplicate the experience at the [[Dallas, Texas]] convention of the [[National Education Association]]'s Department of Superintendence in 1927. The exuberant young musicians pled for the chance to work and play together longer than the few days the convention appearance afforded. Joe Maddy promised them a music camp! In June, 1928, at Interlochen, Michigan, in the midst of a magnificent stand of virgin pine trees between two lovely lakes, The National High School Orchestra Camp opened its doors. On leased land, with the old Hotel Pennington, several cottages, 29 new camper cabins, a hospital, water and sewer system, the new Interlochen Bowl, and $40,000 debt, this brave experiment was launched.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Interlochen was the inspiration for the 1941 Paramount motion picture ''There's Magic in Music'' (AKA "The Hard Boiled Canary").&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0034275/ ''There's Magic in Music''] at the [[Internet Movie Database]]&lt;/ref&gt; Interlochen also provided inspiration, along with [[Blue Lake Fine Arts Camp]], for [[Alyson Hannigan]]'s character in [[American Pie (film series)|American Pie]].

In 2006, [[Katalyst Media]] filmed a reality TV pilot for [[MTV]] at [[Interlochen Arts Academy]]. Afraid that an MTV show would ruin Interlochen's distinguished reputation, a large group of students resorted to protesting and [[trolling]] the [[Katalyst Media]] film crew in order to prevent [[Katalyst Media]] from filming viable footage. Student efforts were successful, and the pilot never aired.

==Pathfinder School Controversy==
From 2000 to 2007, Interlochen Center for the Arts owned and operated the K-8 Interlochen Pathfinder School&lt;!--do not link as it redirects to the U.S. Army Pathfinder School--&gt; in [[Traverse City]], MI.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://archives.record-eagle.com/2007/feb/01pathfinder.htm |title=Interlochen to close Pathfinder School in June |work=Archives.record-eagle.com |date= |accessdate=2009-10-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Pathfinder had approached Interlochen about a potential link-up in the late 1990s after Pathfinder encountered financial and operational difficulty.  Believing that operational and creative synergies between Interlochen and Pathfinder might benefit both schools, Interlochen ran Pathfinder School for 7 years.

After Jeffrey S. Kimpton became president of Interlochen Center for the Arts in 2004, Kimpton sought to close Pathfinder School. According to a Traverse City Record-Eagle article, Interlochen initially agreed to invest $250,000 in improvements and pay off $173,000 in debts after taking ownership of the property in 2000 for one dollar. Kimpton's plan was to close the school, sell the property and land (worth millions), and invest the full real estate proceeds into Interlochen Arts Academy. Interlochen only reversed its decision after Pathfinder parents offered Kimpton $3 million in exchange for keeping the school open. Pathfinder, founded in 1972, continues to successfully operate separately from Interlochen Center for the Arts.

==Interlochen Public Radio==
Interlochen Center for the Arts is home to [[Interlochen Public Radio]], a [[National Public Radio]] member station with studios on the Interlochen campus and multiple broadcast locations that allow the station's signal to reach most of Northern Michigan as well as parts of eastern [[Wisconsin]].

When it was founded in 1963, WIAA (note the similarity between the station call letters and the "IAA" abbreviation for Interlochen Arts Academy) was envisioned as a logical extension of the long-running "Music From Interlochen" program that had been heard for many years on the [[NBC]] radio network, and which helped to spread word about the activities at the then-named National Music Camp and the then-fledgling Interlochen Arts Academy.  The station performed so poorly in its early years that there was talk of shutting down the operation.  Today, however, Interlochen Public Radio thrives and includes both a music service and a news service.

Despite being one of the smallest NPR members, IPR boasts one of the highest rates of per capita contributions of any public radio station in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.interlochen.org/about/time_line] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081225091445/http://www.interlochen.org/about/time_line|date=December 25, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The station's classical service is broadcast from 88.7 FM in [[Interlochen]], 88.5 FM in [[Mackinaw City]], and 100.9 FM in [[East Jordan]]/[[Charlevoix, Michigan|Charlevoix]].  In 2000, it began offering a separate news service on 91.5 FM in [[Traverse City]].  Interlochen is currently investigating acquisition of additional licenses so that IPR can reach larger, more geographically-diverse audiences.

==Interlochen Presents==
'''Interlochen Presents''' has a summer festival running from June through August (schedule announced in April) and a performing arts series from September through May coinciding with the Academy school year (schedule announced in August).  It features concerts, plays, art exhibits, readings, film screenings and dance productions presented by students, faculty, and staff, as well as both well-known and obscure guest artists.  Interlochen Presents events are held in numerous venues around campus.  The list of recent guest artists includes [[Steely Dan]], [[Sheryl Crow]], [[Willie Nelson]], [[Joshua Bell]], [[Jason Mraz]], [[Bonnie Raitt]], [[Olga Kern]], [[Sara Bareilles]], [[Dierks Bentley]], [[Norah Jones]], [[Martha Graham Dance Company]], [[Ra Ra Riot]], [[Bob Dylan]], [[Jewel (singer)|Jewel]], [[Carol Jantsch]], [[Josh Groban]], [[Paula Poundstone]], [[Nathan Gunn]], [[Chris Thile]], and [[Bela Fleck]].  Interlochen Presents and Interlochen Public Radio serve as the primary channels by which Interlochen Center for the Arts connects with the northern Michigan region.

==Interlochen College of Creative Arts==
Interlochen College of Creative Arts was founded in 2004, and offers non-degree arts programs for adults 18 years and over. Most programs are 3–7 days long, and are housed in the Mallory-Towsley Center for Arts Leadership building on Interlochen's campus. The Mallory-Towsley building was completed in summer 2011.

==Awards and accolades==
*'''National Medal of Arts''':  In 2006, Interlochen Center for the Arts was named recipient of the [[National Medal of Arts]], one of the highest honors bestowed by the [[President of the United States]] and [[National Endowment for the Arts]] on individuals or institutions that have contributed substantially to the growth and advancement of the arts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nea.gov/honors/medals/medalists_year.html |title=Lifetime Honors: National Medal of Arts |work=nea.gov |date= |accessdate=2009-10-07 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100304001626/http://www.nea.gov/honors/medals/medalists_year.html#00 |archivedate=2010-03-04 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Interlochen president Jeff Kimpton received the award on behalf of Interlochen Center for the Arts from President [[George W.

*'''Presidential Scholars in the Arts''': Interlochen Arts Academy is a perennial front-runner among American high schools in its production of [[National Foundation for Advancement in the Arts|Presidential Scholars in the Arts]], having produced more recipients of the award than any other school in the nation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ed.gov/programs/psp/index.html |title=U.S. Presidential Scholars Program |work=ed.gov |date=2009-07-21 |accessdate=2009-10-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''National youngARTS Foundation''': Interlochen Arts Academy is also a perennial front-runner in the [[National YoungArts Foundation|youngARTS]] competition, representing approximately 19% of youngARTS finalists. In connection to the youngARTS competition, three Interlochen students, Adam Blodgett '08, Alix Briggs '08, and Steven Johnson '09, were featured on HBO's Primetime Emmy-winning [[Masterclass (TV series)|Masterclass]] series. Alumni [[Josh Groban]] has also appeared on the series as a mentor.

The '''Kyoto Prize in Arts and Philosophy''' is awarded once a year by the [[Inamori Foundation]] for lifetime achievements in the arts and philosophy. The Prize is one of three [[Kyoto Prize]] categories; the others are the [[Kyoto Prize in Advanced Technology]] and the [[Kyoto Prize in Basic Sciences]]. The first Kyoto Prize in Arts and Philosophy was awarded to [[Olivier Messiaen]] in 1985, the "greatest composer to have emerged from 20th century France".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Olivier Messiaen|url=http://www.kyotoprize.org/en/laureates/olivier_messiaen/|publisher=Inamori Foundation|accessdate=17 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Prize is widely regarded as the most prestigious award available in fields which are traditionally not honored with a [[Nobel Prize]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Kyoto Prize honors achievement and character|url=http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/tech/science/columnist/vergano/2006-11-12-kyoto-prize_x.htm|publisher=USA Today|accessdate=1 January 2013|date=11 November 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Le Chemin, Paysage à Meudon''''' also known as '''''Paysage avec personage''''', is an oil on canvas painted in 1911 by the artist, theorist and writer [[Albert Gleizes]]. The work was exhibited at the [[Salon des Indépendants]] during the spring of 1911, Paris; Les Indépendants, Musée moderne de Bruxelles, 1911; [[Galeries Dalmau]], ''Exposicio d'art cubista'', Barcelona, 1912; Galerie La Boétie, ''Salon de La [[Section d'Or]]'', 1912.&lt;ref name="Musées Nationaux"&gt;[http://www.culture.gouv.fr/public/mistral/mnrbis_fr?ACTION=CHERCHER&amp;FIELD_1=REF&amp;VALUE_1=MNAM0001 Site Rose-Valland, Musées Nationaux Récupération]&lt;/ref&gt; ''Le Chemin'' was identified by [[Hector Feliciano]] as having been plundered by the Nazis from the home of collector [[Alphonse Kann]] during [[World War II]]. It was returned to the heirs of Alphonse Kann in July 1997 and placed at public auctions in New York (1999) and London (2010) respectively.

==Description==
''Le Chemin, Paysage à Meudon'' is an oil painting on canvas with dimensions 146.4 x 114.4&amp;nbsp;cm (57.6 by 45 inches), signed and dated 'Albert Gleizes 1911' (lower right); signed again and titled 'Alb Gleizes Paysage' (on the reverse). This work, painted at the outset of 1911, represents a human figure walking through a hilly landscape with trees, houses or villas, a bridge over the [[Seine]] river, and a town with a church (possibly the Paroisse de Saint-Cloud) on the 'horizon', consistent with elements of the town in the southwestern suburbs of Paris, [[Meudon]].

The term 'Cubism' was employed for the first time in June 1911 by [[Guillaume Apollinaire]], speaking in the context of the Indépendants exhibition in Brussels which included this work by Gleizes, along with others by [[Robert Delaunay]], [[Fernand Léger]], and [[Henri Le Fauconnier]]. During the summer, Gleizes was in close contact with [[Jean Metzinger]], who had recently moved to Meudon. Gleizes too lived and worked in the western suburbs of Paris (''la [[banlieue]] ouest''), 24 Avenue Gambetta, [[Courbevoie]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aaa.si.edu/collections/images/detail/armory-show-entry-form-albert-gleizes-painting-la-femme-aux-phlox-14516 Armory Show entry form for Albert Gleizes' painting ''La Femme aux Phlox'']. Walt Kuhn family papers, and Armory Show records, Archives of American Art, Smithsonian Institution. Document shows Gleizes' address&lt;/ref&gt; The Gleizes' family moved to Avenue Gambetta in 1887.&lt;ref name="Peter Brooke"&gt;[http://www.peterbrooke.org.uk/a%26r/a%26rintro Peter Brooke, ''Albert Gleizes, Chronology of his life, 1881-1953'']&lt;/ref&gt; Both artists were discontent with the conventional perspective mechanism. They had long conversations about the nature of form and perception. They agreed that traditional painting gave a static and incomplete idea of the subject as experienced in life. Things, they would conclude, are in fact dynamic, observed to move, are seen from different angles and can be captured at successive moments in time.&lt;ref name="Peter Brooke" /&gt;

''Paysage à Meudon'', Gleizes' largest painting to date, is the principal product of "rodage" (a term used by Gleizes himself) with Jean Metzinger. In his ''Cubism in the Shadow of War: The Avant-Garde and Politics in Paris, 1905-1914'', David Cottington writes of ''Paysage à Meudon'':

:"The classical armature and Claudian image of Gleizes' picture are both overlaid with a pattern of planes and facets that fragments forms, combines perspectives and complicates the relation between spaces and volumes, but does little to disrupt the conventional spatial recession."&lt;ref name="David Cottington"&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?hl=es&amp;id=o3vSvh8CytIC&amp;q=meudon#v=snippet&amp;q=meudon&amp;f=false David Cottington,''Cubism in the Shadow of War: The Avant-Garde and Politics in Paris, 1905-1914'', Yale University Press, 1998]&lt;/ref&gt;

Just as in the works of Metzinger, and unlike those of [[Pablo Picasso]] or [[Georges Braque]] of the same period, Gleizes had no interest in the flattening of the entire surface, of fusing background and foreground to the point where all spatial depth of field was abandoned. Yet Gleizes made use of fragmentation of form, multiple perspective views (i.e., mobile and dynamic, rather than static and from one point-of-view) along with linear and planar structural qualities. Gleizes' ''[[Les Baigneuses (Gleizes)|Les Baigneuses (The Bathers)]]'' of the following year employs the same concept of multiple perspective, but not at the expense of vacating spatial depth. Though highly sophisticated in theory, this aspect of [[simultaneity]] would actually become quite commonly employed within the practices of the [[Section d'Or]] group. Gleizes deployed these techniques in ''"a radical, personal and coherent manner"'' (Cottington, 1998).&lt;ref name="David Cottington" /&gt;

In his catalogue preface for the 1911 Indépendants de Bruxelles,&lt;ref&gt;Preface, ''Catalogue of 8th Salon annuel du Cercle d'art Les Indépendants, Musée moderne de Bruxelles, 10 June - 3 July 1911''&lt;/ref&gt; Guillaume Apollinaire wrote of this painting, titled ''Le chemin'':

&lt;blockquote&gt;"Il est sorti un art simple et noble, expressif et mesuré, ardent à la recherche de la beauté et tout prêt à aborder ces vastes sujets que les peintre d'hier n'osaient entreprendre."&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Gleizes' [[Proto-Cubism|Proto-Cubist]] work entitled ''[[L'Arbre, The Tree (Gleizes)|L'Arbre (The Tree)]]'' exhibited at the 1910 [[Salon des Indépendants]] in Paris was the point of departure for ''Paysage à Meudon''. Visibly distant from the work of Picasso or Braque, ''Paysage à Meudon'' is stylistically much closer to Metzinger, Le Fauconnier, Léger and Delaunay. Gleizes' interpretation of space in a succession of plans and simple geometric lines descends directly from the teachings of [[Paul Cézanne]]. These same aesthetic preoccupations would unite several artists that formed a group and held meetings in Puteaux, at the Duchamp residence. For their first public manifestation as a group—the Salon de la [[Section d'Or]] of 1912—Gleizes chose to present this 1911 landscape (no. 39 of the catalogue), along with [[Les Baigneuses (Gleizes)|Les Baigneuses]] and the monumental ''[[Harvest Threshing|Le Dépiquage des Moissons (Harvest Threshing)]]'' both of 1912.&lt;ref&gt;''Collection, Musée national d'Art moderne'', Edition du Centre Pompidou, Paris, 1986, {{ISBN|2-85850-292-7}}, pp. 247, 248&lt;/ref&gt;

In their Lot Notes for the 1999 sale, Christie's writes:

:In 1911, Albert Gleizes was at the height of his artistic powers and Paysage Meudon is one the artist's most celebrated paintings. [...] In the present work, Gleizes retained a traditional sense of perspective and employed the use of a vanishing point in the road and the houses in the background. There is a logical dimunition of form, and in this respect Gleizes' Cubism retained his singular vision of imposing a sense of weight and volumetric relationships to his subjects.&lt;ref name="Christie's 1999"&gt;[http://www.christies.com/lotfinder/lot/albert-gleizes-paysage-meudon-1609515-details.aspx?intObjectID=1609515#top Christie's, New York, Rockefeller Plaza, Sale 9224, 20th Century Art (Evening Sale), 9 November 1999]&lt;/ref&gt;

In their Lot Notes for the 2010 sale, Christie's writes:

:''Le Chemin (Meudon)'' is a large and important painting made by Albert Gleizes in the summer of 1911 at the height of his new friendship and collaboration with fellow Cubist Jean Metzinger. One of his largest and most ambitious paintings from this period, made in direct response to the inspiration of Metzinger, it was exhibited by Gleizes at the groundbreaking exhibition of the so-called 'Salon Cubists', Robert Delaunay, Fernand Léger, Henri Le Fauconnier and Gleizes, at the Salon des Indépendants in June 1911.&lt;ref name="Christie's 2010"&gt;[http://www.christies.com/lotfinder/paintings/albert-gleizes-le-chemin-5334975-details.aspx#top Christie's, London, King Street, Sale 7857, Impressionist/Modern Evening Sales, Lot 38, 23 June 2010. Lot Notes]&lt;/ref&gt; With its prismatic Cubism, shifting multiple perspective points and its holistic integration of landscape and figure centred around this lone figures journey through a path in the woods and through the heart of the picture, this work represents a radical extension of Gleizes' Cubism into an entirely new integrated and simultaneous style of composition.&lt;ref name="Christie's 2010" /&gt;

The Salon des Indépendants at which ''Le Chemin (Meudon)'' had been exhibited was held from 21 April to 13 June in the spring of 1911; so Gleizes' painting could not possibly have been made "in the summer of 1911" as stated in the Christie's catalogue notes.

==History==
[[Alphonse Kann]] had been admired for his extraordinary taste and keen eye. Before the war his collection included at least thirty-five paintings by [[Pablo Picasso|Picasso]], in addition to many others by artists such as [[Georges Braque|Braque]], [[Paul Klee|Klee]], [[Henri Matisse|Matisse]], [[Édouard Manet|Manet]], [[Gustave Courbet|Courbet]], [[Pierre-Auguste Renoir|Renoir]]. ''Paysage à Meudon'' was among approximately 130 works that had been looted from the Kann collection by the German Occupation Army in 1940. The National Museums of Recuperations recovered ''Paysage à Meudon'' in 1949 and it subsequently went into the collection of the [[Musée National d'Art Moderne]], Paris. On 11 July 1997 the Musée National d'Art Moderne returned Gleizes' ''Paysage à Meudon'', stolen by Nazi occupiers during the Second World War, to the heirs of the art collector Alphonse Kann.&lt;ref name="Christie's 1999" /&gt;

Didier Schulman, a curator at the [[Centre Georges Pompidou]], confirmed the return of the painting to Francois Warin, grand-nephew of Alphonse Kann. The Gleizes painting was one of 2,000 objects returned to France from Germany after the war. If a work remained unclaimed, they were temporarily entrusted to museums. These artworks are known as National Museum Recovery (NMR). Francois Warin learned of the Gleizes painting from a book written in 1997 by the journalist [[Hector Feliciano]], ''The Lost Museum'', which traces the fate of many works confiscated by the Nazis.&lt;ref&gt;Hector Feliciano, ''The Lost Museum, The Nazi Conspiracy to Steal the World's Greatest Works of Art'', p. 215; New York, Basic Books, 1997, {{ISBN|978-0-465-04194-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Lee Yanowith"&gt;[http://www.museum-security.org/97/july14.html France returns artwork looted by Nazis to owner, Reuters, 14 July 1997]&lt;/ref&gt;

Feliciano found Gleizes' ''Landscape'' while researching his book. The painting was listed in documents of the [[Einsatzstab Reichsleiter Rosenberg]] (ERR), a Nazi government branch that supervised the confiscation of artworks in France. Feliciano said that after plundering the painting, the Nazis brought it to the [[Galerie nationale du Jeu de Paume]] in Paris where confiscated artworks were deposited.&lt;ref name="Lee Yanowith" /&gt;

"For the Germans it was [[degenerate art]] so they bartered it or sold it for the type of paintings they liked," said Feliciano. Because the Nazis considered [[Cubism]], [[Futurism]] and [[Impressionism]] "degenerate", German art dealers were able to inexpensively acquire them or exchange them for less valuable works that the Nazis coveted.&lt;ref name="Lee Yanowith" /&gt;
 
France's [[Court of Audit (France)|Cour des Comptes]], a state spending 'watchdog' charged with conducting financial and legislative audits of public and private institutions, accused the museums of failing in their legal duty to seek out the owners or heirs of the works, including paintings by [[Pablo Picasso]], [[Pierre-Auguste Renoir]], [[Claude Monet]], [[Paul Cézanne]] and sculptures by [[Auguste Rodin]]. In an attempt to rebut the charges, French authorities put 900 of the MNRs on exhibit in five national museums, including [[The Louvre]] and the Pompidou Centre. Gleizes' ''Paysage à Meudon'' was among them. The state-museum network explained that few or none of the works in its possession were looted from Jews, but were sold to the Nazis by collaborationist dealers in the wartime Parisian art market.&lt;ref name="Lee Yanowith" /&gt; However, works such as the Gleizes, were indeed seized from Jews deported to death camps or fleeing persecution, or sold under duress at rock-bottom prices.&lt;ref name="Lee Yanowith" /&gt;

Feliciano accused state museums of doing nothing to try and return the MNRs to their owners. Warin had to wait a year to recover the work after his original claim, even though documents listing the Gleizes were in France's Foreign Ministry archives.

"This is proof the museums haven't done their job for 50 years,'' Feliciano said. "They had these documents in their hands."&lt;ref name="Lee Yanowith" /&gt;

==''Paysage près de Paris''==
''Le Chemin'' was not the only work by Gleizes to be looted by the Nazis: ''Paysage près de Paris'', also referred to as ''Landschaft bei Paris'' and ''Paysage de Courbevoie'', 1912, an oil on canvas of dimensions 72.8 x 87.1&amp;nbsp;cm, has been missing from Hannover since 1937. This work is listed in the [[Koordinierungsstelle für Kulturgutverluste|Lost Art Internet Database]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lostart.de/Webs/EN/Datenbank/EinzelobjektSucheSimpel.html?param=EOBJ_ID%3D405193%26SUCHE_ID%3D1756528%26_page%3D0%26_sort%3D%26_anchor%3Did4406 Lost Art Internet Database, Albert Gleizes, ''Paysage près de paris, Paysage de Courbevoie'', 1912]&lt;/ref&gt; Formerly in the collection of Dr. Paul Erich Küppers, Hannover, Germany (the first director [[kestnergesellschaft|Kestner society]] art gallery), the painting was confiscated by the German [[Ministry of Public Enlightenment and Propaganda]] (Reichsministerium für Volksaufklärung und Propaganda, RMVP or Propagandaministerium) in Hannover (1937) from Leihgabe im Landesmuseum Hannover, Beschlagnahme 1937, Gal. Buchholz Berlin, and has been missing ever since.

In the mid-6th century, the introduction of [[Buddhism]] from Korea ([[Baekje]]) to Japan resulted in a revival of [[Japanese sculpture]]. Buddhist monks, artisans and scholars settled around the capital in [[Yamato Province]] (present day [[Nara Prefecture]]) and passed their techniques to native craftsmen. Consequently, early Japanese sculptures from the [[Asuka period|Asuka]] and [[Hakuhō period|Hakuhō]] periods show strong influences of continental art, which initially were characterized by almond-shaped eyes, upward-turned crescent-shaped lips and symmetrically arranged folds in the clothing. The workshop of the Japanese sculptor [[Tori Busshi]], who was strongly influenced by the [[Northern Wei]] style, produced works which exemplify such characteristics. The [[Shaka Nyorai|Shakyamuni]] triad and the Guze [[Guanyin|Kannon]] at [[Hōryū-ji]] are prime examples. By the late 7th century, wood replaced bronze and copper. By the early [[Tang dynasty]], greater realism was expressed by fuller forms, long narrow slit eyes, softer facial features, flowing garments and embellishments with ornaments such as bracelets and jewels. Two prominent examples of sculptures of this period are the [[Avalokiteśvara|Shō Kannon]] at [[Yakushi-ji]] and the Yumechigai Kannon at Hōryū-ji.&lt;ref name="stat-asuka"/&gt;&lt;ref name="asukanet"&gt;{{cite web

During the [[Nara period]], from 710 to 794, the government established and supported workshops called zōbussho, the most prominent of which was located in the capital [[Nara, Nara|Nara]] at [[Tōdai-ji]], which produced Buddhist statuary. Clay, [[lacquer]] and wood, in addition to bronze, were used. Stylistically, the sculptures were influenced by the high Tang style, showing fuller body modelling, more natural drapery and a greater sense of movement. Representative examples of Nara period sculpture include the Great Buddha and the [[Four Heavenly Kings]] at Tōdai-ji, or the Eight Legions at [[Kōfuku-ji]].&lt;ref name="stat-nara"&gt;{{cite web

Early [[Heian period]] works before the mid-10th century appear heavy compared to Nara period statues, carved from single blocks of wood, and characterised by draperies carved with alternating round and sharply cut folds. Stylistically, they followed high to later Tang style. In the Heian period the zōbussho were replaced with temple-run and independent workshops; wood became the primary medium; and a specific Japanese style emerged. By the mid-10th century, the style was refined presenting a more calm and gentle appearance, with attenuated proportions. [[Jōchō]] was the most important sculptor of this time, and he used the ''yosegi'' technique, in which several pieces of wood are joined to sculpt a single figure. He was the ancestor of three important schools of Japanese Buddhist statuary: the {{Not a typo|Enpa}}, Inpa and Keiha school. The [[Amida Nyorai]] at [[Byōdō-in]] is the only extant work by Jōchō.&lt;ref name="stat-nara"/&gt;&lt;ref name="stat-heian"&gt;{{cite web

Japanese sculpture experienced a renaissance during the [[Kamakura period]], led by the [[Kei school]]. Partially influenced by [[Song dynasty]] China, their sculpture is characterised by realism featuring elaborate top knots, jewelry, and wavy drapery. Although predominantly wooden, bronze was also used as a material for the statues. As a novelty, portrait sculptures of prominent monks were created adjacent to the depiction of Buddhist deities.&lt;ref name="stat-kamakura"&gt;{{cite web

Typically [[hinoki]], [[Torreya nucifera|Japanese nutmeg]], [[sandalwood]] and [[Cinnamomum camphora|camphorwood]] were the woods used for the wooden sculptures. Wooden sculptures were often lacquered or covered with gold-leaf. The smallest statue measures around {{convert|10|cm}}, whereas the Great Buddhas of Nara and Kamakura are about {{convert|13|m}} and {{convert|15|m}} high.

==Usage==
The table's columns (except for ''Remarks'' and ''Pictures'') are sortable pressing the arrows symbols. The following gives an overview of what is included in the table and how the sorting works.
*''Name'': name as registered in the [http://www.bunka.go.jp/bsys/index.asp List of National Treasures]
*''Remarks'': placement of statues (as a group, separately,...) and artist (if known)
*''Date'': period and year; The column entries sort by year. If only a period is known, they sort by the start year of that period.
*''Material and technique'': wood/bronze/..., lacquered/colored/...; The column entries sort by the main material (stone/clay/wood/lacquer/bronze).
*''Pose'': standing/seated Amida Nyorai/Yakushi Nyorai/...; The column entries sort by the name of the principal image or as "set" in the case of sets of sculptures that don't fall under a common group name.
*''Height'': height in cm; The column entries sort by the largest height if an entry is a group of statues.
*''Present location'': "building-name temple/museum/shrine-name town-name prefecture-name"; The column entries sort as "prefecture-name town-name temple/museum/shrine-name building-name".
*''Image'': picture of the statue or a characteristic statue in a group of statues

'''Marxman''' were a four-piece [[Marxism|Marxist]] [[hip hop music|hip-hop]] [[band (music)|group]] with two [[MC]]s&lt;ref name="Lime"&gt;"Marxman: Woman and Child", ''Lime Lizard'', May 1993, p. 24-5&lt;/ref&gt; formed in [[London]] in 1989.
Their lyrics expounded [[Socialism (Marxism)|socialism]] and an end to economic and social injustice. They are one of only a few groups that combine hip-hop with traditional Irish compositions.

==History==

The band was formed by college friends Stephen Brown (Phrase D) and (MC) Hollis Michael Byrne, who also enlisted the help of Byrne's childhood friend from Ireland, Oisin Lunny, son of Irish traditional musician Dónal Lunny. The band were completed by scratch mixer DJ K One. Together they developed an overt political message in a scene dominated by [[Gangsta rap]], inspired by [[Hip-Hop]], [[Motown Records|Motown]] [[soul music|soul]] and traditional Irish music. Their debut 1992 single "Sad Affair" which borrowed lyrics from the [[Irish rebel music|Irish rebel song]] "Irish Ways and Irish Laws"&lt;ref name="starpulse" /&gt; was banned by the [[BBC]].&lt;ref name="Lime" /&gt; The bands later single, "All About Eve" peaked at number 28 in the [[UK Singles Chart]],&lt;ref name="CS"&gt;[https://archive.is/20130119013300/http://www.chartstats.com/artistinfo.php?id=6724 Marxman], Chart Stats, retrieved 2010-05-26&lt;/ref&gt; resulting in a performance on the BBC's flagship music programme ''[[Top of the Pops]]''. Their controversial influences stemmed more from their militant socialism than traditional nationalism.&lt;ref name="starpulse" /&gt;

Their initial releases were on the [[Talkin' Loud]] record label and the group built a significant fanbase prior to the release of their debut single. Their debut album came the following year, when they released ''[[33 Revolutions per Minute]]'' in the UK, before launching themselves into the American market in 1994.&lt;ref name="starpulse" /&gt; However the album failed to generate significant sales in the USA and Marxman left Talkin' Loud for the More Rockers label. They released their second and final album in 1996, ''[[Time Capsule (Marxman album)|Time Capsule]]'' which was a strong album but with less overtly Irish traditional musical influences than their debut release before disbanding later in the same year.&lt;ref name="starpulse" /&gt;

==Subject Matter==

Whilst the Irish Republican themes in "Sad Affair" are well publicised, Marxman lyrics also considered themes such as [[domestic violence]] with their 1993 single "All About Eve", and comparing the African slave trade and the [[Plantations of Ireland|colonisation of Ireland]] to modern [[wage slavery]] in "Ship Ahoy".

==Legacy==

Although once touted as the Anglo-Irish answer to [[Public Enemy (band)|Public Enemy]],&lt;ref name="starpulse" /&gt; the group themselves played down such comparisons. Their politics was at the fore and breaking down musical boundaries was paramount.  The band were very well respected live and it was onstage that the power of their music really came across. Despite working with a number of high-profile musicians, collaborating with [[James McNally (musician)|James McNally]] of [[The Pogues]] and having [[Sinéad O'Connor]] as guest vocalist on the single "Ship Ahoy" the band were very much a rap group and their track "Drifting" was produced in New York by Hip Hop legend DJ Premier of Gang Starr. The band also worked with SD50, Dante Ross' production team and Mike Mangini and Shane Faber (Brand Nubian, Digable Planets and many more) were producers on the Time Capsule Album. &lt;ref name="Lime" /&gt; They also supported [[U2]] and [[Depeche Mode]] on their respective ''[[Zoo TV Tour|Zoo TV]]'' and ''[[Devotional Tour|Devotional]]'' tours. Marxman toured extensively around Europe as well as the USA and played many events and fundraisers for the various causes they believed in. A percentage of their single "All About Eve" was donated to Victim Support charities and they played a sold out gig at London's Jazz Cafe in support of that single and cause. They are considered to have been forerunners of the [[trip hop]] genre alongside bands such as [[Massive Attack]] and [[Portishead (band)|Portishead]],&lt;ref name="starpulse"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.starpulse.com/Music/Marxman-P143141/Biography/ |title=Marxman Biography |publisher=Starpulse.com |date= |accessdate=2011-10-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; and contributed to the establishment of the "[[Bristol underground scene|Bristol sound]]".&lt;ref name="allmusic"&gt;{{cite web|last=Donnelly |first=Dave |url=http://www.allmusic.com/album/33-revolutions-per-minute-r205669/review |title=33 Revolutions Per Minute - Marxman |publisher=AllMusic |date= |accessdate=2011-10-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Nuova Accademia di Belle Arti''', "New Academy of Fine Arts", also known as '''NABA''', is a privately run university in [[Milan]], [[Lombardy]], Italy. It has approximately 3000 students,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.naba.it/why-choose-naba/?lang=en&lt;/ref&gt; some of whom are from abroad; it participates in the [[Erasmus Programme]].

==History==

NABA was founded in Milan in 1980.{{citation needed|date=September 2013}}

In 1994 the Nuova Accademia received one of the forty "Ambrogino" certificates of civic merit awarded each year by the [[Comune]] of Milan.&lt;ref name=ambrogio&gt;[http://www.comune.milano.it/dseserver/ambrogini/attach/elenco%20CIVICHE%20BENEMERENZE_storiche.pdf Benemerenze Civiche (elenco aggiornato all'anno 2011)] (in Italian). Accessed May 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2008 NABA also began hosting a “node”, or center linked to the [[University of Plymouth]]’s Planetary-Collegium research platform,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.plymouth.ac.uk/research/273 Planetary-Collegium]&lt;/ref&gt; offering various PhD programs in the arts and technology.

NABA was bought by Bastogi Spa of Milan in 2002. In December 2009 Bastogi sold it to [[Laureate Education]] of [[Baltimore]], Maryland, for €22 million.&lt;ref name=bastogi&gt;[http://www.bastogi.com/it/storia/ Storia]. Bastogi Spa. (in Italian) "History".

(in Italian) "Precious schools of design sold to an American colossus". Accessed May 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Accreditation and International Programs==

NABA is listed by the [[Ministero dell'Istruzione, dell'Università e della Ricerca]], the Italian ministry of education, as a "legally recognized academy" in the AFAM classification of schools of music, art and dance that are considered equivalent to a traditional university.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.afam.miur.it/argomenti/istituzioni/accademie-di-belle-arti-legalmente-riconosciute.aspx/ AFAM, Alta Formazione Artistica, Musicale e Coreutica: Accademie di belle arti legalmente riconosciute].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6623">'''Pacific Sisters''' is a collective of [[Pacific]] and [[Māori people|Māori]] artists, performers, fashion designers, jewellers and musicians.

==Establishment and early years==
The collective was formed in 1992 by Selina Forsyth ([[Samoans|Samoan]]) Niwhai Tupaea (Ngāti Katoa) and [[Suzanne Tamaki]] ([[Tūhoe]], [[Te Arawa]], [[Ngāti Maniapoto]]).&lt;ref name = 'Rault'&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Charles-Rault|first1=Jacqueline|title=More than simply traditional - Pacific Sisters|journal=Pacific Arts: The Journal of the Pacific Arts Association|date=2010|volume=10|issue=2}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The sisterhood also includes [[Rosanna Raymond]] (Samoan), Feeonaa Wall (Samoan), [[Ani O'Neill]] ([[Cook Islands]]), [[Lisa Reihana]] ([[Ngā Puhi]]), Jaunnie Ilolahia ([[Tongans|Tongan]]) and is inclusive of Pacific Soles: Henry Taripo (Cook Islands) and Karlos Quartez (Cook Islands) and Greg Semu (Samoan).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Gracewood|first1=Gemma|title=Picking up Sisters along the way|journal=Tama Toa|date=1996}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
Throughout the 1990s Pacific Sisters collaborated in the production of fashion shows, art performances and musical events.&lt;ref name = 'Vercoe &amp; Leonard'&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Leonard|first1=Robert|last2=Vercoe|first2=Caroline|title=Pacific Sisters: Doing It for Themselves|journal=ART AsiaPacific|date=1997|volume=no. 14|issue=1039-3625|pages=43–45}}&lt;/ref&gt; Karen Stevenson, author of ''The Frangipani is Dead: Contemporary Pacific Art in New Zealand''  writes, “Challenging the established art canon, The Pacific Sisters combined costume, tradition, dance and the catwalk with the energetic rhythms of hip hop”.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Stevenson|first1=Karen|title=The frangipani is Dead: Contemporary Pacific Art in New Zealand 1985-2000|date=2008|publisher=Huia|location=Wellington, NZ|isbn=9781869693251|page=56}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Sisters created a stage for expression of urban Māori and Pacific identity within New Zealand, as Jacqueline Charles Rault wrote ‘The Pacific Sisters were and remain provocative, sexy and rebellious’&lt;ref name = 'Rault'/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Schaer|first1=C|title=Outside the Square|agency=Canvas Magazine Supplement|publisher=New Zealand Herald|date=March 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
In 1994 Pacific Sisters performed at the [[Auckland Art Gallery]] for the opening of ''Bottled Ocean'', curated by Jim Vivieaere.&lt;ref name = 'Vercoe &amp; Leonard'/&gt; In 1996 the Sisters were invited and also received funding from [[Creative New Zealand]] to perform in Samoa for the seventh [[Festival of Pacific Arts]]: Tala Measina. They developed ''Motu Tangata,'' a contemporary realisation of the narrative of Ina/Hina and Tuna. The festival abstained from officially hosting ''Motu Tangata'', aware of the implications a contemporary style of performance such as ''Motu Tangata'' could have at an event that celebrated customary practices from the Pacific. For two consecutive nights however, the Sisters performed ''Motu Tangata'' at the Hotel Kitano Tusitala.&lt;ref name= 'Rault'/&gt; 
 
In 1998 their performance ''Tribe Vibe and the Extended Family Mix'' was selected as part of Sydney's Pacific Wave Festival.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|journal=Lava Magazine|date=November 1998|volume=44|issue=1174-572x 9 771174 572006}}&lt;/ref&gt; 1998 also saw their work exhibited in ''Tūrangawaewae'', the 3rd New Zealand Jewellery Biennale at [[The Dowse]] and in ''Raw Fish'', at The Physics Room in Christchurch.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Raw Fishes|url=http://physicsroom.org.nz/archive/oldsite/gallery/1998/rawfish/|website=The Physics Room|accessdate=5 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2000 Pacific Sisters performed at the opening of the [[Biennale of Sydney]] in collaboration with Lisa Reihana.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Levine|first1=Brett|title=Variety is the Spice of Life: The Biennale of Sydney 2000|journal=Art New Zealand|date=November 2000|volume=96}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Recent years==
In 2011 Pacific Sisters reunited to present ''Pacific Sisters SOUTHSIDE: EyeKonik'' at the Mangere Arts Centre – Ngā Tohu o Uenuku as part of the 2011 Pacific Arts Summit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Pacific Sisters SOUTHSIDE reunion!|url=https://2011pacificartssummit.wordpress.com/2011/04/06/pacific-sisters-southside-reunion/|website=2011 South Auckland Pacific Arts Summit|accessdate=12 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Their work ''21st Century Cyber Sister'' is held in the collection of the [[Museum of New Zealand Te Papa Tongarewa]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=21st Century Cyber Sister|url=http://collections.tepapa.govt.nz/topic/1547|website=Te Papa Tongarewa|accessdate=5 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 2018 Te Papa opened its new art spaces, Toi Art. The opening exhibition included ''Pacific Sisters: Fashion Activists'', "a celebration of mana wāhine, indigenous identities, and the role this collective has played over the past 26 years – through their collaborative works across fashion, performance, music, and film – in giving voice and visibility to Māori and Pacific peoples in Aotearoa New Zealand."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Pacific Sisters: Fashion Activists |url=https://www.tepapa.govt.nz/visit/exhibitions/toi-art/pacific-sisters-fashion-activists |website=Museum of New Zealand Te Papa Tongarewa, |accessdate=6 June 2018 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Richard Parkes Bonington''' (25 October 1802&lt;ref name=Chambers/&gt; – 23 September 1828) was an English [[Romanticism (art)|Romantic]] [[Landscape art|landscape]] painter, who moved to France at the age of 14 and can also be considered as a French artist, and an intermediary bringing aspects of English style to France.&lt;ref&gt;Novotny, 171&lt;/ref&gt; Becoming, after his very early death, one of the most influential British artists of his time, the facility of his style was inspired by the old masters, yet was entirely modern in its application. His landscapes were mostly of coastal scenes, with a low horizon and large sky, showing a brilliant handling of light and atmosphere. He also painted small historical [[cabinet painting]]s in a freely-handled version of the [[troubadour style]].

==Life and work==
[[File:Richard Parkes Bonington 003.jpg|thumb|240px|''[[Francis I of France|François I]] and [[Marguerite de Navarre]]'' (45.7 by 34.5 cm), based on the discovery of a scratched inscription on a window at the [[Château de Chambord]]]]

Richard Parkes Bonington was born in the town of [[Arnold, Nottinghamshire|Arnold]], four miles from [[Nottingham]].&lt;ref name=Chambers&gt;"Arnold" in ''[[Chambers's Encyclopædia]]''. London: [[George Newnes]], 1961, Vol. 1, p. 633.&lt;/ref&gt; His father also known as Richard was successively a gaoler, a drawing master and lace-maker, and his mother a teacher. Bonington learned watercolour painting from his father and exhibited paintings at the [[Liverpool Academy of Arts|Liverpool Academy]] at the age of eleven.

In 1817, Bonington's family moved to [[Calais]], France, where his father had set up a lace factory. At this time, Bonington started taking lessons from the painter [[François Louis Thomas Francia]],&lt;ref name="Ingamells, 19"&gt;Ingamells, 19&lt;/ref&gt; who, having recently returned from England, where he had been deeply influenced by the work of [[Thomas Girtin]],&lt;ref&gt;Binyon, pp.166 – 7&lt;/ref&gt; taught him the English watercolour technique. In 1818, the Bonington family moved to Paris to open a lace shop. There he met and became friends with [[Eugène Delacroix]]. He worked for a time producing copies of Dutch and Flemish landscapes in the [[Louvre]]. In 1820, he started attending the [[École des Beaux-Arts]] in Paris, where he studied under [[Antoine-Jean, Baron Gros]].&lt;ref name="Ingamells, 19"/&gt;

It was around this time that Bonington started going on sketching tours in the suburbs of Paris and the surrounding countryside. His first paintings were exhibited at the Paris Salon in 1822. He also began to work in oils and lithography, illustrating [[Baron Isidore Justin Séverin Taylor|Baron Taylor]]'s ''Voyages pittoresques dans l'ancienne France'' and his own architectural series ''Restes et Fragmens''. In 1824, he won a gold medal at the Paris Salon along with [[John Constable]] and [[Anthony Vandyke Copley Fielding]], and spent most of the year painting coastal views in [[Dunkirk]].&lt;ref name="Ingamells, 19"/&gt;

In 1825 he met Delacroix on a visit with [[Alexandre-Marie Colin]] to London, and they sketched together there, and shared a studio for some months in Paris on their return; Delacroix influenced him in turning to historical painting. He also developed a technique mixing watercolour with [[gouache]] and gum, achieving an effect close to oil painting.  In 1826 he visited northern Italy,&lt;ref name="Ingamells, 19-20"&gt;Ingamells, 19-20&lt;/ref&gt; staying in Venice for a month,&lt;ref name="Binyon, pp.169"&gt;Binyon, pp. 169&lt;/ref&gt; and London again in 1827–8. In late 1828 his [[tuberculosis]] worsened and his parents sent him back to London for treatment. Bonington died of tuberculosis on 23 September 1828 at 29 Tottenham Street in London, aged 25.&lt;ref name="Ingamells, 19-20"/&gt;

[[File:Landscape near Quilleboeuf Richard Parkes Bonington.jpeg|thumb|right|240px|''Landscape near Quilleboeuf'', c. 1824–1825. [[Yale Center for British Art]]]]
Delacroix paid tribute to Bonington's work in a letter to [[Théophile Thoré]] in 1861. It reads, in part:
&lt;blockquote&gt;When I met him for the first time, I too was very young and was making studies in the Louvre: this was around 1816 or 1817... Already in this genre (watercolor), which was an English novelty at that time, he had an astonishing ability... To my mind, one can find in other modern artists qualities of strength and of precision in rendering that are superior to those in Bonington's pictures, but no one in this modern school, and perhaps even before, has possessed that lightness of touch which, especially in watercolours, makes his works a type of diamond which flatters and ravishes the eye, independently of any subject and any imitation.&lt;ref&gt;Noon, Patrick: ''Richard Parkes Bonington "On the Pleasure of Painting"'', page 12. [[Yale University Press]], 1991.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

To [[Laurence Binyon]] however, "Bonington's extraordinary technical gift was also his enemy. There is none of the interest of struggle in his painting."&lt;ref name="Binyon, pp.169"/&gt;

Bonington had a number of close followers, such as Roqueplan and Isabey in France, and [[Thomas Shotter Boys]], James Holland, [[William Callow]] and [[John Scarlett Davis]] in England.

'''Robert von Haug''' (27 May 1857, [[Stuttgart]] - 3 April 1922, Stuttgart) was a German [[impressionist]] painter, illustrator and lithographer who specialized in scenes from the  "[[German campaign (Napoleonic Wars)|Befreiungskriege]]".

== Life ==
From 1872 to 1877, he was enrolled at the {{ill|Stuttgart Kunstschule|de|Staatliche Akademie der Bildenden Künste Stuttgart}}, then spent two years at the [[Academy of Fine Arts, Munich]], where he studied with [[Carl von Häberlin]], [[Bernhard von Neher]] and [[Otto Seitz]]. While there, he was a close associate of [[Karl Stauffer-Bern]] and [[Ludwig von Herterich]]. In 1879, he returned to Stuttgart. His first major exhibitions came after 1883, including one at the [[Glaspalast (Munich)|Glaspalast]], but his chief occupation was book illustrating. He also painted frescoes for the Stuttgart City Hall.

He became a Professor at the Kunstschule in 1894. From 1912 to 1916 he was also the school's Director. One of his best-known students was [[Carl Geist]]. Around 1912 a dispute began between the [[Avant-garde]] faction led by [[Adolf Hölzel]] and the Traditionalists, with whom Haug sided. He was replaced as Director by Hölzel, who resigned three years later when the school rejected [[Paul Klee]] for a teaching post.&lt;ref&gt;Meinrad Schaab, Hansmartin Schwarzmaier (ed.): ''Handbuch der baden-württembergischen Geschichte.''

'''''RogerEbert.com''''' is an American [[film review]] website that archives reviews written by film critic [[Roger Ebert]] for the ''[[Chicago Sun-Times]]'' and also shares other critics' reviews and essays. Ebert handpicked writers from around the world to contribute to the website. After Ebert died in 2013, the website was relaunched under Ebert Digital, a partnership founded between Ebert, his wife Chaz, and friend Josh Golden.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last=Hernandez | first=Brian Anthony | url=https://mashable.com/2013/04/09/rogerebert-website-redesign/#zqJcdNSqksqw| title=Roger Ebert's Website for Film Reviews Gets Makeover | work=[[Mashable.com]] | date=April 9, 2013 | accessdate=June 22, 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Two months after Ebert's death, Chaz Ebert hired film and television critic [[Matt Zoller Seitz]] as editor-in-chief for the website&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine | last=Abramovitch | first=Seth | url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/matt-zoller-seitz-named-editor-562541 | title=Matt Zoller Seitz Named Editor of RogerEbert.com | magazine=[[The Hollywood Reporter]] | date=June 4, 2013 | accessdate=June 22, 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt; because his [[IndieWire]] blog PressPlay shared multiple contributors with RogerEbert.com, and because both websites promoted each other's content.&lt;ref name="osenlund"&gt;{{cite news | last=Osenlund | first=R.

''[[The Dissolve]]''{{'}}s Noel Murray described the website's collection of Ebert reviews as "an invaluable resource, both for getting some front-line perspective on older movies, and for getting a better sense of who Ebert was." Murray said the website included reviews Ebert rarely discussed in conversation, such as those for ''[[Chelsea Girls]]'' (1966) and ''[[Good Times (film)|Good Times]]'' (1967), written when Ebert was in his twenties.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last=Murray | first=Noel | url=https://thedissolve.com/features/exposition/638-roger-eberts-oldest-least-republished-reviews-are-/ | title=Roger Ebert’s oldest, least-read reviews reveal the writer he'd become | work=[[The Dissolve]] | date=June 30, 2014 | accessdate=June 22, 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt; R. Kurt Osenlund of ''[[Slant (magazine)|Slant]]'' said in 2013 that other contributors (including Seitz, Sheila O'Malley, and Odie Henderson) had "a lot of first-person narrative" in their work like Ebert did, adding, "but there are other contributors, like Ignatiy Vishnevetsky, who don’t do so much of that. The overall diversity makes the site a kind of [[Artist collective|artists' collective]]."&lt;ref name="osenlund" /&gt;

RogerEbert.com has routinely hosted a "Women Writer's Week" in honor of [[Women's History Month]], featuring content from female contributors for the entire week.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last=Bonazzo | first=John | url=http://observer.com/2016/03/rogerebert-com-holds-women-writers-week-to-celebrate-diversity/ | title=RogerEbert.com Holds Women Writer’s Week to Celebrate Diversity | work=[[The Observer]] | date=March 31, 2016 | accessdate=June 22, 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Following the [[United States presidential election, 2016|United States presidential election of 2016]], the 2017 "Women Writer's Week" was reported by ''[[The Observer]]'' to be "overtly political thanks to President Donald Trump".

The region of [[Shekhawati]] in [[Rajasthan]] is remarkable for its wealth of mural paintings which adorn the walls of many buildings, including [[havelis]].

==History==

===Shekhawati region===
Shekhawati describes a district, or nizamat, of the pre-Independence kingdom of Dhundar or [[Jaipur]]. This region was ruled by descendants of the 15th century Rajput baron, Rao Shekha, who were known as Shekhawats. It is covered by the two modern districts of [[Jhunjhunu]] and [[Sikar]].  Churu district lay in the neighbouring kingdom of [[Bikaner]], but its nearest towns to the north and west, although never part of Shekhawati, contain similar painted buildings.

===17th century===
Traces of wall paintings are found on Shekhawati structures erected by Muslim nawabs, Rajputs and Banias dating back to the 17th century. A local style was influenced by 16th/17th century [[Mughal Empire|Mughal]] work in [[Agra]] and [[Fatehpur Sikri]] via painted monuments in [[Amer, India|Amer]]. The earliest dated Shekhawati work includes the ‘Jaipur fresco’ work, which was employed before Jaipur’s foundation by craftsmen employed by Mughal rulers and in Amer. This involves thick layers of pigment being applied and worked onto a wet plaster surface. The pigment is often incised [[scraperboard]]-like with geometric and floral designs. The interior work is usually painted [[fresco-secco|secco]], using [[tempera]], onto dry plaster.

In the few surviving 17th century painted buildings some popular [[Jahangir]] period (1605–27) subjects such as winged-head cherubs (from Baroque Europe via Goa), hatted Persian angels, the pheasant-like [[simurgh]], cypress trees, lotus bud decoration and the Sufi tale of the lovers [[Layla and Majnun|Laila and Majnu]] may be integrated with popular Hindu religious and folk themes. Early 18th century structures in Udaipurwati, Jhunjhunu district, such as Jokhi Das ki Chhatri, dated 1702, and the c1700 Chaturbhuj Temple at Nathusar, Sikar district, even include portraits of the emperor [[Aurangzeb]] (1658-1707). Most of these early murals are painted in red, yellow and green ochres but green copper carbonate and both white and red lead also feature in the palette.

===18th century===
In the 18th century, under the patronage of [[Rajput]] rulers and [[Vaishya]] merchants, a number of temples and chhatris were richly decorated with figurative paintings.  Some forts also contained painted rooms. Again, ochres formed the general palette and the figures were largely drawn from the Hindu pantheon. Amongst other subjects chosen are stylised portraits, hunting scenes, folk tales and historic battles, particularly the Battle of Maonda 1767, in temples, or in chhatris which commemorated those who fought or died. Good examples are in small c1700 temples east of Sri Madhopur at Bagriawas, Nathusar and Lisaria, both Sikar district, in the chhatri (1750) and temple (1742) at Parasrampura, Jhunjhunu district, the 8-pillar chhatri (1776) in Churu and, perhaps by the same hand, the Bihari Temple in Jhunjhunu (1777).&lt;ref&gt;Cooper, Ilay and Sharma, Ravindra. ''Survey of the Monuments of Churu, Jhunjhunu and Sikar Districts of Rajasthan 1985-87'' New Delhi: INTACH. Unpublished.&lt;/ref&gt; Such painting continued into the 19th century in forts, like those at Mandawa, Nawalgarh and Mahansar, all in Jhunjhunu district, as well as temples and [[chhatris]], often using a richer palette.

Apart from a few temples and chhatris, merchant monuments predating an 1818 treaty between Jaipur and the new British regime were lightly painted externally with floral motifs and arabesques.

===19th and early 20th centuries===
[[File:Le Prince Haveli courtyard.JPG|thumb|Courtyard of 19th century Nadine Le Prince Haveli]]
The great merchant era of patronage began around 1830 when Shekhawati merchants, settled in Calcutta and elsewhere, began to pour money back to their hometowns, much of which was turned to conspicuous building.&lt;ref&gt;Timberg, T.A. 1978. ''The Marwaris: From Traders to Industrialists.'' New Delhi: Vikas.&lt;/ref&gt;   By then, under British protection, they were no longer shy of drawing attention to their wealth.  The most obvious blossoming of wall-paintings in Shekhawati is on late 19th and early 20th century havelis.  They aimed to construct five buildings: a [[haveli]], a temple, a memorial [[chhatri]], a well and a [[caravansarai]].&lt;ref&gt;Cooper, Ilay. 2009. ''The Painted Towns of Shekhawati.'' New Delhi: Prakash Books.
&lt;/ref&gt; Most were painted. The havelis offer the most variable subject matter, but temples, memorial chhatris and [[cupolas]] decorating wells are often richly decorated.

==Painters and their methods==

===Painters===
The building boom attracted many Muslim chejaras, masons, and Hindu kumhars, members of the potter caste who became masons, to Shekhawati. The painters were mostly gifted, self-taught men drawn from amongst them. For the finest work, teams of professional painters were called in from the Jaipur direction. Where painters have signed, they are from Jaipur or its vicinity. Masons whose ancestors painted often talk of their family migrating from the southeast.

===Techniques===

The walls themselves are the richest source of information on techniques and scientific studies&lt;ref&gt;Hauff. Gottfried. 1991 ''The Techniques of the Wall Paintings of Rajasthan, India.'' Worms am Rhein. in Zeitschrift fur Kunsttechnologie und Konservierung.&lt;/ref&gt; confirm their account. Half-finished work is always informative. Murals on the unfinished ceiling of Gopinath Temple, Parasrampura (1742) show that the pictures, though continuous, were drawn and coloured piecemeal on the dry plaster surface. Lines in charcoal and red ochre were corrected. Outlines of groups of figures were drawn, then corrected and reach their final form when the artist paints them in, colour by colour. There is no trace of drawing away from the tracts of plaster the painter was decorating. Most was done freehand, but on other buildings there are clear signs of dotted stencilled outlines; arcs and straight lines were aided by string. Townscapes were constructed with a straight-edge. Unfinished examples depicting Jaipur survive in a Nawalgarh chhatri and in Khetri’s Bakhtawar Mahal. The pigments were mixed with an adhesive, often gum from the common plant, akra but also egg or saresh, gum made from camel bone. 
‘Jaipur Fresco’ work on the outer walls of havelis shows construction lines created by a taut string covered with ochre or charcoal dust flicked against the wet plaster, leaving an imprint and colour. Rapid freehand sketches with a sharp stylus, often corrected, have left their mark in the plaster surface. The paint was applied in blocks of thick pigment massaged against the wet lime surface to be partially integrated with calcium carbonate as it forms. The surface was burnished with agate and polished with coconut flesh. Some fine details such as jewellery were added in tempera and stand proud of the surface.

===Pigments===
Until the mid 19th century the paints were mineral or vegetable pigments. Ochres dominated but in finer interior work red and white lead, cinnabar, indigo, [[lapis lazuli]], copper carbonate, vivid Indian yellow. The lead pigments were prone to oxidisation, blackening. From the mid 19th century, Germany’s industrial revolution created chemically synthesised pigments which were soon cheaply available. Ultramarine blue (from artificial lapis) and chrome red dominated external paintings after 1860. By the close of the 19th century many more colours were available, sometimes in jarring combinations.

==Subjects==

===Religious themes===
These dominate all the pictures. Most relate to the ten or twenty-four most common incarnations of [[Vishnu]]. Of these Rama and Krishna are by far the most popular. Shaivite subjects, particularly Shiva, Ganesh and Durga are commonplace. Ganesh presides over every doorway. Brahma occurs but his consort, Saraswati, is more frequent. Local deities such as Gugaji, Ramdevji and Pabuji appear infrequently.

===Folk mythology===
Folk tales are generally depicted by a single image, the most striking event in the story. In Dhola-Maru, the popular Rajasthani story, Dhola and his wife Maru are shown on a camel fleeing from the wicked bandit, Umra-Sumra. Maru turns to let fly a stream of arrows at him. Punjabi tales such as Heer-Ranjha, Sohni-Mehwal, Sassi-Punu and Binjo-Sorath all feature but the Middle Eastern Sufi tale, Laila-Majnu, is one of the earliest to be depicted. Many other less familiar stories appear, the significance of some now forgotten.

===Historical themes===
Recognisable, or labelled, portraits of historical figures, both Indian and British, feature. These range from Mughal rulers and heroes who opposed them, local princes, British monarchs down to Freedom Fighters including [[Gandhi]]. Historical events occur, too, one being the Battle of Maonda, 1767. European figures are often used to accompany technical innovations including pumps, cars, ships, planes and bicycles.

===Everyday environment===
The painters often draw from their surroundings, depicting farmers at work, folk drawing water from a well, potters, goldsmiths, swordsmiths, carpenters and, occasionally, masons building and painting walls. Domestic and wild animals, birds and plants are commonly depicted.

===Erotica===
Pictures of couples making love are usually cheekily hidden amongst murals on external walls. Sometimes there are depictions of bestiality; men with donkeys or dogs, women with dogs. Homosexuality is very rarely depicted; self-conscious householders sometimes obliterate erotic paintings.

===Map pictures===
Occasionally a team of painters has been commissioned to paint Jaipur or the local town. An excellent example is in the palace sheesh 
mahal at Sikar, where the walled town, complete with people and traffic, is neatly depicted as it was in 1864. The most accessible is in a bastion of the main fort in Nawalgarh, where both Jaipur and Nawalgarh were painted c1850 on the domed ceiling. Other pictures show recognisable local or distant buildings, the Taj Mahal being popular.

===Decorative designs===
Stylised plants or plant-like arabesques, architectural features and geometric patterns are common, chosen for subjects in panels, friezes dividing walls or in spandrels of arches.

==Decline and destruction==
Towards the mid 20th century successful merchants committed themselves to a new urban existence, rarely visiting the homeland save for ritual or charity purposes. Investing in industry, some of these families have become amongst the richest in India. Rented out, locked or neglected, havelis and chhatris are suffering. Wells have been superseded by hand-pumps then by tapped water. Buildings collapse, are whitewashed or are demolished to make way for some new structure. Old paintings are replaced by inferior new work. There is currently no legislation to protect such buildings. Interest inspired by the publication of Wacziarg and Nath's book on the paintings in 1982 led to [[INTACH]] commissioning a documentation of the buildings; many of those surveyed in 1985-87 have since disappeared. Attempts are being made by some groups, such as the Morarka family of Nawalgarh, to create an interest in preserving some of the buildings.

In recent years, the Government has undertaken some efforts towards spreading awareness about this unique art heritage. Both the [[Jawahar Kala Kendra]] in Jaipur and the [[National Crafts Museum]] in Delhi have specially commissioned works of Shekhawati frescoes on their walls.&lt;ref name="bare_url_a"&gt;{{cite book|last=Chaitanya|first=Krishna|title=A History of Indian Painting: The Modern Period|year=1994|publisher=Abhinav Publications|pages=24|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=McSbSMhArFgC&amp;pg=PA330&amp;lpg=PA330&amp;dq=shekhawati+painting#v=onepage&amp;q=shekhavati&amp;f=false|isbn=9788170173106}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sustainable heritage tourism is being seen as one way of both ensuring the protection and conservation of this art. The hoteliers and heritage conservationists Francis Wacziarg and Aman Nath's ''Rajasthan: The Painted Walls of Shekhavati'' and Ilay Cooper's ''The Painted Towns of Shekhawati'' are important works on these murals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Painted town|url=http://www.hindu.com/mag/2005/04/03/stories/2005040300110100.htm|accessdate=3 April 2005|newspaper=The Hindu}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''skipping rhyme''' (occasionally '''skipping-rope rhyme''' or '''jump-rope rhyme'''), is a [[rhyme]] [[chant]]ed by children while [[skipping rope|skipping]]. Such rhymes have been recorded in all cultures where skipping is played. Examples of English-language rhymes have been found going back to at least the 17th century. Like most [[folklore]], skipping rhymes tend to be found in many different variations. The article includes those chants used by English speaking children.&lt;!---only. poetry and jokes translate badly, particularly when metre is required. Thus, not "worldwide"---&gt;

==History==
Explorers reported seeing aborigines jumping with vines in the 16th century. European boys started jumping rope in the early 17th century. The activity was considered indecent for girls because they might show their ankles. There were no associated chants. This changed in the early 18th century. Girls began to jump rope.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.skip-hop.co.uk/history-of-skipping-c28.html|title=The History of Skipping|last=Robert-Shaw|first=Scott|date= |website= |publisher= |access-date=December 6, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; They added the chants, owned the rope, controlled the game, and decided who participated.&lt;ref name=folk&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.historicalfolktoys.com/catcont/92001.html |title=The Jump Rope Book |accessdate=November 2, 2016 |date=1996 |publisher=''HistoricalFolkToys.com''}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the United States, domination of the activity by girls occurred when their families moved into the cities in the late 19th century. There, they found sidewalks and other smooth surfaces conducive to jumping rope, along with a host of contemporaries.&lt;ref name=folk/&gt;

Another source suggests that, prior to 1833, the invention of [[Pantalettes|pantalettes]], enabled girls to jump rope without displaying ankles.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://chnm.gmu.edu/cyh/case-studies/340 |title="Jumping Rope [Advice Book]," in Children and Youth in History, Item #340 |accessdate=November 2, 2016 |year=1833 |publisher=''Chnm.gmu.edu'' }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Chants are intended to structure the game and are secondary, explaining the nonsense or irrational lyrics. These chants are unusual inasmuch as they were transmitted from child to child usually without an underlying reason, as opposed to nursery rhymes which were transmitted from adult to child and often contained a moral. Chants may contain girlish references to boyfriends or marriage.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.britannica.com/art/jump-rope-rhyme |title=Jump rope rhyme |accessdate=November 2, 2016 |date=December 7, 2015 |publisher=Encyclopædia Britannica }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Examples of chants==
Two girls with a long rope stood about {{convert|12|ft}} apart and turned the rope as other children took turns jumping. If one were not a good jumper, one would be an 'Ever-Laster,' that is, one would perpetually turn the rope. When it was a child's turn to jump, she would enter as the rope turned, and jump to the rhyme until she missed. Then she would become a rope-turner, and the next child in line would take her place.{{citation needed|date=November 2014}}

===Jump in, jump out ===
For a line of potential jumpers, the jumpers were restricted on time by the length of the chant/ They jumped in at the beginning, jumped out at the end and the next jumper took their turn.

:Charlie Chaplin went to France
:To teach the ladies how to dance.
:First the heel, then the toe,
:Then the splits, and around you go!
:Salute to the Captain,
:Bow to the Queen,
:And turn your back on the [[Nazi]] submarine!

In another version, the teacher is "Benjamin Franklin."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.buyjumpropes.net/resources/jump-rope-rhymes-songs-buyjumpropesnet/ |title=The Great List of Jump Rope Rhymes &amp; Skipping Songs |accessdate=November 2, 2016 |author=Matt Hopkins |date=July 5, 2014 |publisher=buyjumpropes.net}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In the Charlie Chaplin rhyme, the child jumping had to follow directions as the rope was turning: touching the heel of one foot on the ground; touching the toe of the same foot on the ground; doing a (short) split of the feet, turning around, saluting, bowing, and jumping out from the turning rope on the last line. This rhyme, c. 1942, reflects children's awareness of World War II (The Queen to whom we bowed was the mother of the present Queen of England).{{citation needed|date=November 2014}}

An Australian version of the Charlie Chaplin Skipping Song, as sung at Salisbury Primary School in Brisbane, Australia in the mid 1950s, is as follows:

:Charlie Chaplin went to France,
:To teach the ladies how to dance,
:First he did the Rumba,
:Then he did the twist,
:Then he did the Highland Fling,
:And then he did the splits.

There's also "Betty Grable went to France,/To teach the soldiers how to dance."  (The rest is the same.){{citation needed|date=November 2014}}

:Had a little car car,
:Two-forty-eight,
:Ran around the cor-(''skipper jumps out, and turners continue the syllable until they reenter'')-ner
:and slammed on the brakes, but the brakes didn't work,
:So I bumped into a lady who bumped into a man,
:Who bumped into a police car, man, oh man!
:Policeman caught me
:Put me on his knee,
:Asked me a question
:Will you marry me?
:Yes, No, Maybe So (repeated)

:All in together, birds of a feather:
:January, February, March, April, May, etc. (each child had to jump in during the month they were born).

:I see London, I see France,
:I see (xxx)s underpants,
:Not too big, not too small,
:Just the size of Montreal (or just the size of cannonball, Berlin Wall, etc.)
Another variation:
: I see London, I see France, I see (xxx)s underpants.
: Are they blue? Are they pink? I don't know but they sure stink!
: Teacher, teacher, I declare, I see (xxx)s underwear (or bottoms bare)

====Political statement====
In [[Dublin]], Ireland, the visits of inspectors known as "[[Glimmer Man|Glimmer men]]" to private houses to enforce regulations to prevent the use of coal gas in restricted hours during the [[The Emergency (Ireland)|Emergency]] gave rise to:&lt;ref name='glimmer1'&gt;{{cite web | url = www.hubpages.com/hub/World-War-Two-the-Emergency-Ration-books-in-Stoneybatter-Dublin-7-Ireland | title = Remembering Rationing and Bombs during World War Two in Dublin Ireland | accessdate = 2011-03-18 | last = Reid | first = L.M. | year = 2010 | publisher = ''Hubpages.com'' | quote = Yes we had a rhyme we sang when we played skipping out in the street. It was about the gas rationing and the glimmer.}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
:Keep it boiling on the glimmer, if you don't you get no dinner.

===Counting rhymes===
Most rhymes are intended to count the number of jumps the skipper takes without stumbling. These were essentially restricted to times when there were relatively few jumpers and time was abundant. These rhymes can take very simple forms.

This chant was collected in [[London]] in the 1950s:
:[[Clock Tower, Palace of Westminster|Big Ben]] strikes one,{{citation needed||reason=sounds too long to say while turning/jumping|date=May 2014}}
:Big Ben strikes two,
:Big Ben strikes three,
:(etc.)

and

:Applesauce, mustard, cider&lt;ref&gt;"[http://research.udmercy.edu/find/special_collections/digital/cfa/index.php?term=HOME&amp;field=loc_text&amp;start=1000 Search results for 'home']" in ''The James T. Callow Folklore Archive'', at ''Research.UDMercy.edu''. Accessed: December 6, 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;
:How many legs has a spider?
:1, 2, 3, etc.

alternately, "Salt, vinegar, mustard, pepper. How many legs does a spider have? 1,2,3, etc."

:Had a little sports car, two-forty-eight,
:Ran around the cor-(''skipper jumps out, and turners continue the syllable until they reenter'')-ner
:and slammed on the brakes, but the brakes didn't work,
:So I bumped into a lady who bumped into a man,
:Who bumped into a police car, man, oh man!
:Policeman caught me and put me in jail,
:All I had was ginger ale
:How many bottles did I drink?
:10! 20! 30! 40! ...(increases by 10 for each successful jump)

:Butterfly, butterfly: turn around. [jumper turns while jumping]&lt;ref name="mudcat.org"&gt;"[http://mudcat.org/jumprope/jumprope_display_all.cfm All Jump Rope Rhymes]", ''Mudcat.org''. Accessed: December 6, 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;
:Butterfly, butterfly: touch the ground [jumper touches the ground as she is jumping]
:Butterfly, butterfly: show your shoe. [..thrusts out her shoe]
:Butterfly, butterfly: [n] to do.
:One, two, three, ...   [up to the count of n, which increases by 1 with each set of jumpers]
Another rendition substitutes, "[[teddy bear]]" for "butterfly. This can be dated no earlier than the early 20th century, to the term of [[Theodore Roosevelt]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://playgroundjungle.com/2009/12/teddy-bear-teddy-bear-the-long-history-of-a-jump-rope-rhyme.html |title=Teddy Bear, Teddy Bear: The Long History of a Jump Rope Rhyme |accessdate=November 2, 2016 |author=Adam Selzer |date=December 17, 2009 |publisher=''PlaygroundJungle.com''}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In another skipping rhyme, once the alphabet finishes, participants continue with numbers until skipper catches rope. It is natural for participants to use the letter that the skipper lost on and to use it to find someone's name following the rule of either best friend or boyfriend, depending on what is chosen in the beginning.
:Ice cream, Soda pop, cherry on top,
:Who's your best friend, let's find out;
:Goes A! B! C!
or

:Ice cream soda, cherry on top
:Who's your boyfriend/girlfriend, I forgot;
:Is it an A! B! C!
or

:Ice cream sundae, banana split
:[Name of jumper]'s got a boyfriend/girlfriend,
:Who is it?
:A! B! C!
or

:Ice cream soda, [[Delaware Punch]],
:Tell me the name of my honey-bunch.
:A, B, C, etc.{{citation needed|date=November 2014}}

Another counting rhyme:
:Cinderella dressed in yellow, went upstairs (or downstairs) to kiss her fellow, by mistake kissed a snake, how many doctors will it take? 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10 etc. (Go to 20 then go down to the next line)
:Cinderella dressed in blue, went upstairs to tie her shoe, made a mistake and tied a knot, how many knots will she make? 1, 2, 3, etc.
:Cinderella dressed in green, went downtown to buy a ring, made a mistake and bought a fake, how many days before it breaks? 1, 2, 3, etc.
:Cinderella dressed in lace, went upstairs to fix her face, oh no oh no, she found a blemish, how many powder puffs till she's finished? 1, 2, 3, etc.
:Cinderella dressed in silk, went outside to get some milk, made a mistake and fell in the lake, how many more till she gets a break? 1, 2, 3, etc.
 
The counting continues as long as the jumper avoids faulting. If they do then the counting starts again.:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=The British Library|title=Skipping games - Cinderella, dressed in yellow|url=http://www.bl.uk/learning/langlit/playground/browseadultview.html#cm=Videos&amp;gm=Skipping&amp;id=120554&amp;id2=121109|work=Playtimes|publisher=The British Library (''BL.uk'')|accessdate=3 September 2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121021143318/http://www.bl.uk/learning/langlit/playground/browseadultview.html#cm=Videos&amp;gm=Skipping&amp;id=120554&amp;id2=121109|archivedate=21 October 2012|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Miscellaneous===
*Skipping rhymes need not always have to be rhymes, however. They can be games, such as a game called, "School." In "Kindergarten" (the first round), all skippers must run through rope without skipping. In "First Grade", all skippers must skip in, skip once, and skip out without getting caught in the rope, and so on. Also, there is "Mouse Trap", where there is a special pattern, and players must run through rope without getting caught. If caught, the jumper caught must hold the rope.

[[File:Chinese jump rope Diamonds pattern.svg|thumb|"Diamonds" pattern (the letters spelling "Diamond" are chanted)&lt;ref&gt;Horowitz, Gayle L. (2009). ''International Games: Building Skills Through Multicultural Play'', p.70. Human Kinetics. {{ISBN|9780736073943}}.&lt;/ref&gt;]]

[[Chinese jump rope]] patterns are often accompanied by chants. The diamonds pattern is accompanied by the letters which spell "diamond" ("D-I-A-M-O-N-D-S."), while the Americans pattern, as are many patterns, is accompanied by the names of the moves made while carrying out the pattern ("right, left, right, left, in, out/open, in, on.").

===Speed rhymes===
Some rhymes are intended to test the agility of the jumper by turning the rope more rapidly. The key word to start turning fast is often "pepper" to indicate speed, such as:

:Mable, Mable,
:Set the table,
:Don't forget the salt,
:Vinegar,
:Mustard,
:Pepper!  (rapid turning follows)&lt;ref name="mudcat.org"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Oliver, Ray. "[http://members.iinet.net.au/~murrayoliver/olivers/games.html The Games]", ''The History of the Olivers of Broken Hill''. Accessed: December 6, 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;

*When "RED HOT PEPPERS" was called, the turners would turn the rope as fast as they could.

===Pretty Little Dutch Girl===
 {{main|Pretty Little Dutch Girl}}

"Pretty Little Dutch Girl" was a lengthy song, much too long for a simple chant, but often excerpted for jumping rope. "My husband's name is Fatty. He comes from Cincinnati." Or alphabetical, "My husband's name is Alfred, He comes from Atlanta, He works in the attic.." All made up on the spur of the moment. The jumper may be obliged to jump out upon finishing a letter, or be allowed to continue until either failing to invent new lyrics, or faulting.

===Historical rhymes===
Other rhymes are highly topical, and sometimes survive long after the events that inspired them have disappeared from the headlines. Perhaps the most notorious rhyme of this type is one that began circulating during the 1892 trial of [[Lizzie Borden]]. Despite Lizzie's desire to stay out of the public eye, children would follow her around and chant the rhyme. It later started being used as a rhyme used when skipping-rope:

:Lizzie Borden took an axe
:She gave her mother forty whacks,
:After she saw what she had done,
:She gave her father forty-one.
:Lizzie Borden got away,
:For her crime she did not pay.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

*Variations of this following rhyme, a [[wikt:wordplay|wordplay]] on "influenza," were heard around the time of the [[1918 flu pandemic]]:
:I had a little bird,
:And its name was Enza.
:I opened the window

:There's a big fat policeman by the door, door, door.
:He grabs you by the collar,
:And makes you pay a dollar.
:No, I won't go to Casey's any more.

===Culturally insensitive rhymes===
Children were often the first to notice differences between people and comment on them. Various chants reflect the lack of association with other cultures up until the 1960s or so; such as:

:My parents have pretty eyes{{citation needed|date=May 2014}}
:My mother's [[China|Chinese]]
:My father's [[Japan]]ese
:My brother's [[Taiwan]]ese
:My sister's [[Vietnam]]ese

'''''The Dance Class''''' is an 1874 painting by [[Edgar Degas]].&lt;ref name="The New York Times - 2 September 2008 - Degas's Ballet Students Teach the Lessons of Their Art"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/09/03/arts/dance/03dega.html?pagewanted=all|title=Degas's Ballet Students Teach the Lessons of Their Art|last=[[Alastair Macaulay]]|date=September 2, 2008|work=[[The New York Times]]|publisher=[[The New York Times Company]]|accessdate=11 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is in the collection of the [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]].&lt;ref name="Metropolitan Museum of Art - The Collection Online - The Dance Class - Edgar Degas"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.metmuseum.org/collection/the-collection-online/search/438817?=&amp;imgNo=0&amp;tabName=object-information|title=The Collection Online - The Dance Class - Edgar Degas|publisher=[[Metropolitan Museum of Art]]|accessdate=11 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The painting and its companion work in the [[Musée d'Orsay]], Paris are amongst the most ambitious works by Degas on the theme of ballet. The imaginary scene depicts a dance class being held under the supervision of [[Jules Perrot]], a famous ballet master, in the old Paris Opera, which had actually burnt down the previous year.
The poster on the wall for [[Gioachino Rossini|Rossini]]’s [[William Tell (opera)|Guillaume Tell]] is a tribute to the operatic singer [[Jean-Baptiste Faure]], who had commissioned the work.

The picture is on view in the Met Museum's Gallery 815.

'''''The Dangerous Summer''''' is a nonfiction book by [[Ernest Hemingway]] published posthumously in 1985 and written in 1959 and 1960. The book describes the rivalry between [[Spanish-style bullfighting|bullfighters]] [[Luis Miguel Gonzalez Lucas|Luis Miguel Dominguín]] and his brother-in-law, [[Antonio Ordóñez]], during the "dangerous summer" of 1959. It has been cited as Hemingway's last book.&lt;ref name="publishers note"&gt;{{cite book |last=Hemingway|first=Ernest |title=The Dangerous Summer|year=1985|page=ix }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
''The Dangerous Summer'' is an edited version of a 75,000-word manuscript Hemingway wrote between October 1959 and May 1960 as an assignment from ''[[Life (magazine)|LIFE Magazine]]''. Hemingway summoned his close friend [[Will Lang Jr.]] to come to Spain to deliver the story to ''LIFE Magazine''. The book was edited from the original manuscript by his American publisher [[Charles Scribner's Sons]].&lt;ref name="publishers note"/&gt; A 30,000-word extract from the script was published in three consecutive installments in ''LIFE'' during September 1960.&lt;ref name="publishers note"/&gt;  

Popular author James Mitchener (''Tales of the South Pacific'', ''Hawaii'', ''Centennial'', ''The Source'', ''Poland'') wrote the 33-page introduction which includes Michener's personal knowledge of bullfights and famous matadors, a comprehensive glossary of terms related to each stage of a bullfight, and unvarnished personal anecdotes of Hemingway.

==Account of the season==
[[File:Antonio Ordonez and Ernest Hemingway, Spain, 1959.jpg|250px|thumb|left|Antonio Ordóñez and [[Ernest Hemingway]], 1959 [[Málaga, Spain]].]]
The book charts the rise of Antonio Ordóñez (the son of [[Cayetano Ordóñez]], the bullfighter whose technique and ring exploits Hemingway fictionalized in his novel, ''[[The Sun Also Rises]]'') during a season of bullfights during 1959.&lt;ref&gt;Hemingway (1985), p. 6&lt;/ref&gt; During a fight on May 13, 1959, in [[Aranjuez]], Ordóñez is badly gored but remains in the ring and kills the bull, a performance rewarded by trophies of both the bull's ears, its tail, and a hoof.&lt;ref&gt;Hemingway (1985), pp. 43–47&lt;/ref&gt;

By contrast, Luis Miguel Dominguín is already famous as a bullfighter and returns to the ring after several years of retirement. Less naturally gifted than Ordóñez, his pride and self-confidence draw him into an intense rivalry with the newcomer, and the two meet in the ring several times during the season.&lt;ref&gt;Hemingway (1985), p. 91&lt;/ref&gt; Starting the season supremely confident, Dominguín is slowly humbled by this competition.  While Ordóñez displays breathtaking skill and artistry in his fights, performing highly dangerous, classical passés, Dominguín often resorts to what Hemingway describes as "tricks", moves that look impressive to the crowd but that are actually much safer.&lt;ref&gt;Hemingway (1985), p. 7&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, Dominguín is gored badly at a fight in [[Valencia, Spain|Valencia]], and Ordóñez is gored shortly afterwards.  Less than a month later, the two bullfighters meet in the ring again for what Hemingway described as "one of the greatest bullfights I have ever seen",&lt;ref&gt;Hemingway (1985), p. 103&lt;/ref&gt; "an almost perfect bullfight unmarred by any tricks."&lt;ref name="Hemingway 1985 109"&gt;Hemingway (1985), p. 109&lt;/ref&gt; From the six bulls which they fight, the pair win ten ears, four tails and two hooves as trophies, an extraordinary feat.&lt;ref name="Hemingway 1985 109"/&gt; Their final meeting takes place in [[Bilbao]], with Dominguín receiving a near-fatal goring and Ordóñez demonstrating absolute mastery by performing the ''recibiendo'' kill, one of the oldest and most dangerous moves. Ordóñez's ''recibiendo'' requires three attempts, displaying the fighter's artistry and bravery that Hemingway likens to that of legendary bullfighter [[Pedro Romero]].&lt;ref&gt;Hemingway (1985), pp. 131–132&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''The Grey''''' is a 2011 [[survival film]] co-written, produced and directed by [[Joe Carnahan]] and starring [[Liam Neeson]], [[Frank Grillo]] and [[Dermot Mulroney]]. It is based on the short story "Ghost Walker" by Ian MacKenzie Jeffers, who also co-wrote the screenplay with Carnahan. The story follows a number of [[Landman (oil worker)|oil-men]] stranded in [[Alaska]] after a [[Aviation accidents and incidents|plane crash]], who must wage a war against a pack of [[grey wolf|grey wolves]] stalking them amidst mercilessly cold weather. 

Released in the United States on January 27, 2012, the film received praise for its philosophical themes, cinematography, sound effects and acting, while some of the dialogue and the film's ending were criticized; it grossed $77 million worldwide.

== Plot ==
John Ottway ([[Liam Neeson]]) works in [[Alaska]] as a marksman for an undisclosed oil company, killing grey wolves that threaten the drillers. On his last day on the job, he shoots one. That evening, Ottway writes a letter "without purpose" to his wife, Ana (Anne Openshaw), explaining his plans to commit suicide. He hears a distant wolf howl and doesn't follow through.

The next day, Ottway and other oil drillers board a plane. During the flight, Ottway dreams of sleeping with his wife in bed but is awakened by a loud bang. He buckles up in fear of a possible plane crash. Shortly afterwards, the back of the plane is torn off and it crashes. Eight people including Ottway survive the crash. However, a young oil worker, Lewenden ([[James Badge Dale]]), dies of his injuries as Ottway sadly watches. Taking charge, Ottway sets the survivors on the task of building a fire. While doing this, he discovers a corpse, and is attacked by the [[grey wolf]] feeding on it. After saving Ottway, the group soon surmises that they are in the wolves' territory. They decide to take turns keeping watch for the predators.

Later, Hernandez (Ben Bray) is killed by two wolves. Ottway suggests they leave the crash site, but Diaz ([[Frank Grillo]]) questions his leadership. While searching for the wallets of their deceased colleagues, intending to return them to their families, Diaz finds an emergency wrist watch containing a radio beacon. The group then leaves the site.

While walking, Flannery ([[Joe Anderson (actor)|Joe Anderson]]) falls behind, and is killed by wolves. One of them spots a pack of wolves approaching and the survivors run for the trees, lighting a fire in an attempt to ward off their attackers. The group sets about producing makeshift weaponry.  A stressed Diaz loses his cool somewhat and belligerently threatens Ottway with a knife, but is quickly disarmed and begins regretting his actions. As he's about to apologize, he's suddenly pounced upon by a wolf from behind. An [[Alpha (ethology)|omega wolf]] sent by the [[Alpha (ethology)|alpha wolf]] to test them, Ottway later surmises, after the survivors manage to kill it and then roast it for food. A bloodied and crazed Diaz, elated at having survived the attack, beheads the corpse and loudly howls like a wolf, then defiantly throws the severed head back at the pack. A move noted by the group as possibly unwise, as they accept a statement that "wolves are known to take revenge".

While sitting around the fire, Diaz tells the group of his [[atheist|atheism]] and Talget ([[Dermot Mulroney]]) states he believes in God and lovingly talks about his daughter. Ottway states he is also an atheist, but wishes he could believe or have faith; he then recites a simple poem written by his father. A blizzard approaches; some survivors set to maintaining the fire while the others get some rest.

The following morning, Burke ([[Nonso Anozie]]), who had earlier been suffering from [[Hypoxia (medical)|hypoxia]], is found dead. The remaining survivors leave the camp and travel to the edge of a steep canyon. Hendrick ([[Dallas Roberts]]) secures a line across to a tall tree opposite and Diaz &amp; Ottway traverse the canyon. Talget, however, is afraid of heights and with the added handicap of a bleeding mangled hand, when his foot becomes caught on a hook, in the ensuing struggle the rope breaks away. He falls to the ground, getting severely thrashed by tree branches on the way down; barely alive, he hallucinates a vision of his daughter, but is instantly set upon and dragged away by four wolves. While attempting to save Talget, Diaz falls from the tree and badly injures his knee.

Diaz, Ottway, and Hendrick continue and arrive at a river. There, Diaz, humbled by his journey and unable to walk on, explains that he can accept dying in the middle of nature and will not try to keep running. They part company, leaving a tearful Diaz contemplating the glorious mountainous vista, resigned to his fate. Reluctantly Ottway and Hendrick continue on together. Further along the river, Ottway and Hendrick are set upon by the wolves. In an attempt to flee, Hendrick falls into the river and in the chaos is trapped beneath the surface when his foot gets wedged between boulders. Ottway attempts to save him but unable to pull him loose, Hendrick soon drowns. Frustrated and now alone, Ottway looks up and angrily appeals to God for help, to "show him something real", but seeing nothing, he decides he will “do this on my own.”

Ottway, cold and wet, continues on alone.  Exhausted, he stops walking and begins going through the collected wallets of the others. Ottway then realizes he has stumbled right into the wolves' den - and that the team had been steadily walking towards, not away from, the source of danger. Surrounded by the pack and having the leader of the pack standing in front of him, he looks at his wife's photo in his wallet; it is then revealed that she was dying of a terminal illness (hence his own futility earlier) and that he was trying to kill himself earlier in the film but unable to do so. As the large, snarling alpha wolf approaches him, Ottway arms himself with a knife and shards of glass from small liquor bottles taped to his other hand. He recites the words "Once more into the fray. Into the last good fight I'll ever know. Live and die on this day. Live and die on this day."

In a brief post-credits scene, the alpha wolf lies on the ground, breathing slowly and deeply. Ottway lies against the wolf, viewed from the back - his fate is unclear.

== Production ==
''The Grey'' reunited director [[Joe Carnahan]] with producers [[Ridley Scott]] and [[Tony Scott]] (credited as executive producer) as well as actor [[Liam Neeson]], who collaborated on the 2010 action film ''[[The A-Team (film)|The A-Team]]''. The film initially imagined a much-younger lead character and
[[Bradley Cooper]], who also worked with Carnahan on ''The A-Team'', was cast in the lead role, but he was eventually replaced by Neeson.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Nashawaty|first=Chris|title=Liam Neeson replaces much-younger Bradley Cooper in survival thriller 'The Grey'|url=http://popwatch.ew.com/2010/09/03/liam-neeson-replaces-much-younger-bradley-cooper-in-survival-thriller-the-grey/|work=Entertainment Weekly|accessdate=January 29, 2012|date=September 3, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Smithers Airport|Smithers Regional Airport]].&lt;ref name="theprovince"/&gt; According to Empire magazine, in the climactic scene in which Neeson's character pens a letter to his wife, Carnahan urged Neeson to "channel his grief" over the death of his own wife, [[Natasha Richardson]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Liam Neeson Used Grief Over Wife's Death To Fuel Emotional Scene In 'The Grey'|url=http://www.starpulse.com/news/index.php/2011/12/24/liam_neeson_used_grief_over_wifes_deat|publisher=starpulse|accessdate=February 28, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Carnahan disclosed, in a Q&amp;A session following an early screening at the [[American Cinematheque|Aero Theatre]] in [[Santa Monica, California|Santa Monica]], that he had shot an alternative ending (that he'd never intended to use) showing Neeson battling the alpha wolf. It was supposed to be included in deleted cuts,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|date=January 30, 2012|accessdate=June 18, 2012|title=Joe Carnahan Talks About the Alternate Ending He Shot for 'The Grey'|work=The Moveable Fest|url=http://www.moveablefest.com/moveable_fest/2012/01/carnahan-grey-alternate-ending.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; however, no extras were included on the Blu-ray.

== Reception ==
=== Critical response ===
On [[Rotten Tomatoes]], the film has an approval rating of 80% based on 200 reviews, with an average rating of 6.9/10. The site's critical consensus reads, "''The Grey'' is an exciting tale of survival, populated with fleshed-out characters and a surprising philosophical agenda."&lt;ref name="tomatoes"&gt;{{cite web|title=The Grey (2012)|url=http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/the_grey_2012/|publisher=Rotten Tomatoes|accessdate=July 29, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; On [[Metacritic]], the film has a weighted average score of 64 out of 100, based on 35 critics, indicating "generally favorable reviews".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.metacritic.com/movie/the-grey|title=The Grey reviews|work=Metacritic|accessdate=May 7, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Audiences polled by [[CinemaScore]] gave the film an average grade of "B–" on an A+ to F scale.

[[Roger Ebert]] gave the film 3 and a half stars out of 4, and wrote that the unrelenting harshness of ''The Grey'' so affected him that he departed the screening of a different movie on the same day:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Ebert|first=Roger|title=The Grey|url=http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20120125/REVIEWS/120129984|accessdate=February 2, 2012|newspaper=Chicago Sun-Times|date=January 25, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Quote|It was the first time I've ever walked out of a film because of the previous film. The way I was feeling in my gut, it just wouldn't have been fair to the next film... There's time for some conversation among the men, and this film, directed by Joe Carnahan and written by him and Ian Mackenzie Jeffers, treats them as individuals. They're not simply a group of victims. ''The Grey'' advances with pitiless logic. There are more wolves than men. The men have weapons, the wolves have patience, the weather is punishing. I sat regarding the screen with mounting dread. The movie had to have a happy ending, didn't it? If not "happy," then at least a relief in some sense? Sit through the entire credits.

Dissenters' reviews tend to focus on the film's abrupt ending and perceive the emotional and philosophical undertones as unnecessary. Siobhan Synnot of ''[[The Scotsman]]'' gave the film two stars, commenting that "On the down side, there's a lot of dull pretentious philosophizing about the heartlessness of nature and God.

'''''The Guardian of Paradise''''' ({{Lang-de|'''Der Wächter des Paradieses'''}}) is an 1889 painting by the German artist [[Franz Stuck]]. It shows a glowing angel with bird-like wings and a flaming sword.

It was Stuck's first large oil painting. It was entered into the 1889 art exhibition at the [[Glaspalast (Munich)|Glaspalast]] in [[Munich]], where it won a gold medal and 6000 [[German gold mark|Mark]]. The painting became a breakthrough for Stuck and made him a recognised [[Symbolism (arts)|symbolist]] artist.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.open-culture.co.uk/index.php?option=com_k2&amp;view=item&amp;id=7:franz-von-stuck&amp;Itemid=123&amp;lang=en|title=Franz von Stuck|publisher=Open Culture Foundation|accessdate=2016-06-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Treasure of Lima: A Buried Exhibition''' is an art project curated by Nadim Samman for Thyssen-Bornemisza Art Contemporary Academy, taking place on a remote, protected island in the [[Pacific Ocean]] off the coast of [[Costa Rica]]. Works by forty artists were placed inside a chest and then buried in a secret location on [[Cocos Island]], the place whose pirate history inspired Robert Louis Stevenson’s [[Treasure Island]].

== Background ==
Isla del Coco (Cocos Island) is the historical source of many foundational legends relating to [[buried treasure]]. The best known of the treasure legends tied to the island is that of the [[Treasure of Lima]]: In 1820, with the army of [[José de San Martín]] approaching [[Lima]], Viceroy José de la Serna entrusted the treasure from the city to British trader Captain William Thompson for safekeeping until the Spaniards could secure the country. Instead of waiting in the harbour as they were instructed, Thompson and his crew killed the Viceroy’s men and sailed to Cocos, where they buried the treasure. Shortly afterwards, they were apprehended by a Spanish warship. Thompson and his first mate said they would show the Spaniards where they had hidden the treasure in return for their lives, but after landing on Cocos they escaped into the forest. A large number of attempts have been made to find the treasure, but none has succeeded.

==The project==
The art project consists of a vacuum sealed container containing artworks by forty artists, buried at a secret location. The contents of the container include works on paper, sculpture, vinyl LPs, digital video and audio files. The container is a [[truncated tetrahedron]] made of stainless steel that opens to reveal a second spherical container made of glass. Within this vacuum-sealed sphere there are a series of aluminium boxes housing the artworks.

Artists represented in the project include [[Marina Abramovic]], [[Doug Aitken]], [[Darren Almond]], [[Angela Bulloch]], [[Los Carpinteros]], [[Phil Collins]], [[Constant Dullaart]], [[Olafur Eliasson]], [[Carl Michael von Hausswolff]],  [[Pierre Huyghe]],  [[Sharon Lockhart]], [[Carsten Nicolai]], [[Raymond Pettibon]], [[Lari Pittman]], [[Jon Rafman]],  [[Matthew Ritchie]], [[Ed Ruscha]], [[Chicks on Speed]],  [[Ryan Trecartin]], [[Chris Watson (musician)|Chris Watson]], and [[Lawrence Weiner]].

The container was buried on Cocos Island in May, 2014, by an expedition led by art collector and patron [[Francesca von Habsburg]].

The [[GPS coordinates]] of the exhibition location were given to the Dutch artist Constant Dullaart, who worked with a [[cryptographer]] to encode them. The resulting string of code was then made physical, as a 3D printed steel cylinder. This physical ‘map’ will be sold at auction{{when|date=October 2017}}, encased within a second edition of the treasure chest, with proceeds donated to the marine protection of Cocos Island under the auspices of the Area de Conservation Marina Isla Del Coco.

The '''Vani Gospels''' (Vani Four Gospels; {{lang-ka|ვანის ოთხთავი}}, {{lang|ka-Latn|Vanis otkhtavi}}) is an [[illuminated manuscript]] of the [[Tetraevangelion|Four Gospels]] in the [[Georgian alphabet|Georgian]] ''nuskhuri'' script dating from the end of the 12th–early 13th centuries. The manuscript was composed at the queen [[Tamar of Georgia]]'s request by the Georgian [[monk]] John the Unworthy at the Rhomana Monastery at [[Constantinople]]. It was later brought to Georgia and kept first at the Shorata Monastery ([[Meskheti]]), then in [[Vani]] ([[Imereti]]; hence comes its name) and eventually at the [[Gelati Monastery]] at [[Kutaisi]]. 

The manuscript consists of 274 [[wikt:folio|folio]]s each of 29X21 cm in size and is abundantly illuminated. It is now at the [[Georgian National Center of Manuscripts]] in [[Tbilisi]], Georgia (A-1335).

The '''Western Mexico shaft tomb tradition''' or '''shaft tomb culture''' refers to a set of interlocked cultural traits found in the western [[Mexican states]] of [[Jalisco]], [[Nayarit]], and, to a lesser extent, [[Colima]] to its south, roughly dating to the period between 300 [[Common Era|BCE]] and 400 [[Common Era|CE]], although there is not wide agreement on this end-date.  Nearly all of the artifacts associated with this shaft tomb tradition have been discovered by looters and are without [[provenance]], making dating problematic.&lt;ref&gt;The International Council of Museum estimates that 90% of the clay figurines come from illegal excavations [http://icom.museum/redlist/LatinAmerica/english/page04.htm ICOM] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080506134137/http://icom.museum/redlist/LatinAmerica/english/page04.htm |date=2008-05-06 }}.&lt;/ref&gt;  The first major undisturbed shaft tomb associated with the tradition was not discovered until 1993, at Huitzilapa, Jalisco.&lt;ref&gt;Williams, [http://www.famsi.org/research/williams/wm_classicperiod.html Classic period page] as well as Danien, p. 23.  There is some evidence (Meighan &amp; Nicholson, p. 42) that many tombs were looted in ancient times.&lt;/ref&gt;

Originally regarded as of [[Purépecha culture|Purépecha]] origin,&lt;ref&gt;Judy Sund, [http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m0422/is_4_82/ai_69411773/pg_13 p. 13].&lt;/ref&gt; contemporary with the [[Aztec]]s, it became apparent in the middle of the 20th century, as a result of further research, that the artifacts and tombs were instead over 1000 years older.  Until recently, the looted artifacts were all that was known of the people and culture or cultures that created the shaft tombs.  So little was known, in fact, that a major 1998 exhibition highlighting these artifacts was subtitled: "Art and Archaeology of the Unknown Past".&lt;ref&gt;See Townsend, Richard (1998) ''Ancient West Mexico: Art and Archaeology of the Unknown Past'', Thames &amp; Hudson. &lt;br&gt; Also, in the fourth edition of his ''Mexico: from the Olmecs to the Aztecs'', [[Michael Coe]] talks about "our abysmal ignorance of the prehistory of the area", p. 56.&lt;/ref&gt;

It is now thought that, although shaft tombs are widely diffused across the area, the region was not a unified [[cultural area]].&lt;ref&gt;''The Oxford Encyclopedia of Mesoamerican Cultures'' says, for example, that "At no time in the pre-Hispanic era did any political or cultural entity impose itself on the whole region, even though certain cultural patterns (such as the building of shaft-and-chamber tombs) have in fact been widely diffused", Michelet p. 328.  Beekman (2000, p.  393) makes the same argument.&lt;/ref&gt;  Archaeologists, however, still struggle with identifying and naming the ancient western Mexico cultures of this period.

==Description==
[[File:Ancient Western Mexico Archaeological Sites.svg|350px|thumb|Western Mexico archaeological sites. The orange circles show archaeological sites. The larger green circles highlight the most important sites. Note that the sites form what has been called the "shaft tomb arc" which extends from northwest Nayarit through the central Jalisco highlands and down to Colima.]]

The shaft tomb tradition is thought to have developed around 300 BCE.&lt;ref&gt;Williams, [http://www.famsi.org/research/williams/wm_classicperiod.html Classic period page] and most other sources give the 300 BCE date.  For example, Dominique Michelet in ''The Oxford Encyclopedia of Mesoamerican Cultures'' says "it probably started earlier" than 200 BCE.&lt;/ref&gt; Some shaft tombs predate the tradition by more than 1000 years – for example, the shaft tomb at [[El Opeño]] in [[Michoacán]] has been dated to 1500 BCE but is linked to Central, rather than Western, Mexico.  Like much else concerning the tradition, its origins are not well understood, although the valleys around [[Tequila, Jalisco]], which include the archaeological sites of Huitzilapa and Teuchitlan, constitute its "undisputed core".&lt;ref&gt;Beekman (2000) p. 388 &amp; 394.&lt;/ref&gt;  The tradition lasted until at least 300 CE although there is not wide agreement on the end date.&lt;ref&gt;The proposed end date of the shaft tomb tradition varies considerably.  Williams as well as the [[De Young Museum]] give a date of 300 CE.  The International Council of Museums, on the other hand, provides a date of 500 CE, while the Smithsonian and ''The Oxford Encyclopedia of Mesoamerican Cultures'' give 600 CE.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Western Mexico [[shaft tomb]]s are characterized by a vertical or nearly vertical shaft, dug 3 to 20 metres down into what is often underlying volcanic [[tuff]].  The base of the shaft opens into one or two (occasionally more) horizontal chambers, perhaps 4 by 4 metres (varying considerably), with a low ceiling.  The shaft tombs were often associated with an overlying building.

Multiple burials are found in each chamber and evidence indicates that the tombs were used for families or lineages over time.&lt;ref&gt;Coe et al., p. 102.&lt;br&gt; Williams, [http://www.famsi.org/research/williams/wm_classicperiod.html Classic period page].&lt;/ref&gt;  The labor involved in the creation of the shaft tombs along with the number and quality of the grave goods indicate that the tombs were used exclusively by the society's [[elite]]s,&lt;ref&gt;Beekman (2000) p. 388.&lt;/ref&gt; and demonstrate that the shaft tomb cultures were highly stratified at this early date.

The sites of El Opeño and [[La Campana (archaeological site)|La Campana]] in [[Colima]] feature some shaft tombs, and are often associated with the [[Capacha]] culture.

==Ceramic figurines and tableaus==
[[File:Shaft tomb tree tableau 2.jpg|300px|thumb|A Nayarit tableau showing a multi-layered tree with birds.  It has been proposed that the birds represent souls who have not yet descended into the underworld,&lt;ref&gt;AMNH, [http://anthro.amnh.org/anthropology/research/mca_objects.cfm?case_number=3], which further cites Butterwick, Kristi (2004) ''Heritage of Power: Ancient Sculpture from West Mexico'', Metropolitan Museum of Art.&lt;/ref&gt; while the central tree may represent the [[Mesoamerican world tree]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.utexas.edu/cofa/a_ah/dir/precol/west_mexico.htm Kappelman]&lt;/ref&gt;]]
[[Grave goods]] within these tombs include hollow ceramic figures, [[Obsidian use in Mesoamerica|obsidian]] and [[shell jewelry]], semi-precious stones, pottery (which often contained food), and other household implements such as spindle whorls and [[metate]]s (see [https://www.flickr.com/photos/petwerewolf/85154232/ this Flickr photo] for a reconstruction).  More unusual items include [[conch shell]] trumpets covered with stucco and other appliques.  Unlike those of other Mesoamerican cultures such as the [[Olmec]] and the [[Maya civilization|Maya]], shaft tomb artifacts carry little to no iconography and so are seemingly bereft of symbolic or religious meaning.&lt;ref&gt;Covarrubias (1957) p. 87.&lt;/ref&gt;

The plentiful ceramic figurines have attracted the most attention, and are among the most dramatic and interesting produced in [[Mesoamerica]].&lt;ref&gt;Christensen.&lt;/ref&gt;  In fact, these ceramics were apparently the primary outlet for artistic expression for the shaft tomb cultures and there is little to no record of associated monumental architecture, [[stela]]e, or other public art.&lt;ref&gt;Meighan and Nicholson, p. 47.&lt;/ref&gt;

Since the vast majority of these ceramics are without [[provenance]], analysis has largely focused on the ceramics' styles and subjects.

===Styles===
The major stylistic groups include:

*[[Ixtlán del Rio (archaeological site)|Ixtlan del Rio]].  These abstract figurines have flat, squarish bodies with highly stylized faces complete with nose rings and multiple earrings.  Seated figurines have thin rope-like limbs while the standing figurines have short stocky limbs.  One of the first styles to be described, noted ethnographer, and caricaturist [[Miguel Covarrubias]] stated that it "reaches the limits of absurd, brutal caricature, a peculiar aesthetic concept that relishes the creation of haunting subhuman monstrosities".&lt;ref&gt;Covarrubias, p. 89-90.&lt;/ref&gt;  Art historian [[George Kubler]] finds that "the square bodies, grimacing mouths, and staring eyes convey a disturbing expression which is only in part resolved by the animation and plastic energy of the turgid forms".&lt;ref&gt;Kubler, p. 194.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Chinesco style reclining female - Nayarit Mexico - 300 BCE-300 CE.jpg|right|300px|thumb|A Chinesco-style figurine (Type C), showing the archetypal puffy, slit-like eyes and short tapered legs.]]

*"Chinesca" or "Chinesco" figurines were named by art dealers after their supposed Chinese-like appearance. An early type, Chinesco is identified with Nayarit&lt;ref&gt;See, e.g., Kubler, p. 194.&lt;/ref&gt; and up to five major subgroups have been identified, although there is considerable overlap.&lt;ref&gt;Meighan and Nicholson state that the Chinesco types "merge in a rather complex fashion", p. 58.&lt;/ref&gt;  Type A figurines, the so-called "[[:Image:Chinesca Nayarit.jpg|classic Chinesco]]",&lt;ref&gt;Kan. p. 21.&lt;/ref&gt; are realistically rendered.  One prominent curator, Michael Kan, finds that "their calm, subtle exterior suggests rather than demonstrates emotion".&lt;ref&gt;Kan, p. 22.&lt;/ref&gt;  These Type A figures are so similar to one another that it has been suggested that they were the production of a single "school".&lt;ref&gt;Kan, p. 17, who references Peter Furst (1966) "Shaft Tombs, Shell Trumpets and Shamanism", Ph. D. dissertation, UCLA.&lt;/ref&gt;  Types B through E are more abstract, characterized by puffy, slit-like eyes blended into the face, and broad rectangular or triangular heads.  These figures are often shown seated or reclining, with shortened bulbous legs quickly tapering to a point.&lt;ref&gt;Kan. p. 22.&lt;/ref&gt;
*The Ameca style, associated with Jalisco, is characterized by an elongated face and a high forehead which is often capped by braids or turban-like headgear. The [[aquiline nose]] is also elongated and the large eyes are wide and staring, with pronounced rims created by adding separate strips of clay ("fillets") around the eyes.&lt;ref&gt;Covarrubias, p. 91.  These "fillets" are often referred to as appliqués.&lt;/ref&gt;  The wide mouth is closed or slightly opened and the large hands have carefully delineated nails.  Kubler detects both an early "sheep-faced" style that seem "eroded or melted in the continuous passages of modelling that unite rather than divide the parts of the body" and a later style which are "more animated and more incisively articulated".&lt;ref&gt;Kubler, p. 193.&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Colima shaft tomb dog (T Aleto).jpg|300px|thumb|A fat, and perhaps fattened, dog from Colima &lt;ref&gt;In discussing ceramic types, Kubler, p. 195, refers to the "fattened and edible dogs of Colima".&lt;/ref&gt;]]
*Colima ceramics can be identified by their smooth, round forms and their warm brown-red [[slip (ceramics)|slip]].&lt;ref&gt;Metropolitan Museum of Art [http://www.metmuseum.org/TOAH/ho/05/cam/ho_1979.206.478.htm].&lt;/ref&gt;  Colima is particularly known for its wide range of animal, especially dog, figurines.  Human subjects within the Colima style are more "mannered and less exuberant" than other shaft tomb figurines.&lt;ref&gt;Kan, p. 26.&lt;/ref&gt;

Other styles include El Arenal, San Sebastián, and Zacatecas.  Although there is general agreement on style names and characteristics, it is not unanimous.  Moreover, these styles often overlap to one degree or another, and many figurines defy categorization.

===Subject matter===
Common subjects of shaft tomb tradition ceramics are:

*Ceramic tableaus showing several or even several dozen people engaged in various seemingly typical activities.  Concentrated in highland Nayarit and adjoining Jalisco, these tableaus present rich [[ethnography|ethnographic]] insight into [[funeral|funerary]] practices, the [[Mesoamerican ballgame]], architecture (most importantly perishable architecture), and perhaps even religious thought during the [[Mesoamerican chronology|late Formative period]].&lt;ref&gt;See Taylor for discussion of the religious insight offered by these tableaus.&lt;/ref&gt;

Some tableaus are almost photographic in their detail and have even been associated with architecture ruins in the field.&lt;ref&gt;Foster et al., p. 47 as well as Wiegand, p. 400.&lt;/ref&gt;  
[[File:Shaft tomb culture village scene.jpg|300px|thumb|A characteristic circular ceramic tableau showing more than a dozen musicians and dancers]]
*Ceramic dogs are widely known from looted tombs in Colima.  Dogs were generally believed in [[Mesoamerica]]n cultures to represent soul guides of the dead&lt;ref&gt;Among many others, see Coe et al., pp. 103–104, or Kubler, p. 195.&lt;/ref&gt; and several dog ceramics wear human masks.&lt;ref&gt;See [https://www.flickr.com/search/?q=colima%20dog%20mask&amp;w=all these photos] from Flickr for an example of a mask-wearing Colima dog.  Another is part of the Stafford Collection at the Los Angeles County Museum of Art (see ''Sculpture of Ancient West Mexico, Nayarit, Jalisco, Colima'').&lt;/ref&gt;  Nonetheless, it should also be noted that dogs were often the major source of animal protein in ancient Mesoamerica.&lt;ref&gt;Coe (1994), p. 45 and many others.&lt;/ref&gt;
*Ancestor (or marriage) pairs of female and male figurines are common among shaft tomb tradition grave goods.  These figurines, perhaps representing ancestors,&lt;ref&gt;Metropolitan Museum of Art, [http://www.metmuseum.org/special/Heritage_of_Power/Heritage_of_Power_more.htm].&lt;/ref&gt;  may be joined or separate and often are executed in the [[Ixtlán del Río]] style.
*Many shaft tomb figurines, spanning various Western Mexico styles and locations, wear a horn set high on the forehead.  Several theories have been advanced for these horns: that they show that the figure is a [[shaman]], that they are abstract [[conch|conch shells]] (a not uncommon shaft tomb relic)&lt;ref&gt;The Las Cebollas tomb contained 125 conch shells (Meighan &amp; Nicholson, p. 39).  Beekman (2000) lists conch shell trumpets, along with dogs and horned figures, as three examples of "common symbolic threads" of the shaft tomb tradition.&lt;/ref&gt; and as such, are an emblem of rulership, or are a [[phallic symbol]].&lt;ref&gt;Danien.&lt;/ref&gt;  These theories are not mutually exclusive.

===Uses===
While these ceramics were obviously recovered as [[grave goods]], there is a question of whether they were specifically created for a mortuary rite, or whether they were used prior to burial, perhaps by the deceased.  While some ceramics do show signs of wear, it is as yet unclear whether this was the exception or the rule.&lt;ref&gt;Meighan and Nicholson, p.59.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Context==

===Western Mexico cultures===
Considerable effort has been made connecting the shaft tomb tradition to the [[Teuchitlán tradition]], a complex society that occupies much the same geography as the shaft tomb tradition.

Unlike the typical [[Mesoamerican pyramids]] and rectangular central plazas, the Teuchitlán tradition is marked by central circular plazas and unique conical pyramids.&lt;ref&gt;Weigand, p. 402.  Weigand contends that the structures of the Teuchitlán tradition's ceremonial architecture "are unique in the Mesoamerican architectural repertoire and indeed are not found anywhere else in the world".&lt;/ref&gt;  This circular architectural style is seemingly mirrored in the many circular shaft tomb tableau scenes.  Known primarily from this architecture, the Teuchitlán tradition rises at roughly the same time as the shaft tomb tradition, 300 BCE, but lasts until 900 CE, many centuries after the end of the shaft tomb tradition.&lt;ref&gt;Beekman (2000) abstract.&lt;/ref&gt;  The Teuchitlán tradition appears to be an outgrowth and elaboration of the shaft tomb tradition.&lt;ref&gt;Beekman (1996), p. 138.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Mesoamerican cultures===
Because western Mexico is on the very periphery of [[Mesoamerica]], it has long been considered outside the Mesoamerican mainstream and the cultures at this time appear to be particularly insulated from many mainstream Mesoamerican influences.&lt;ref&gt;Meighan and Nicholson, p. 60.&lt;/ref&gt;  For example, no [[Olmec]]-influenced artifacts have been recovered from shaft tombs, nor are any [[Mesoamerican calendars]] or [[Mesoamerican writing systems|writing systems]] in evidence,&lt;ref&gt;Michelet, p. 328.&lt;/ref&gt; although some Mesoamerican cultural markers, particularly the Mesoamerican ballgame, are present.

[[File:Ameca style figurine from Jalisco (Zeetz Jones).jpg|right|230px|thumb|An Ameca-style figurine from Jalisco. The horn is a not-uncommon feature of many tradition figurines.  The ball would appear to link the subject to the [[Mesoamerican ballgame]].]]

Despite this, the inhabitants of this area lived much like their Mesoamerican counterparts elsewhere.  The usual trio of beans, squash, and [[maize]] was supplemented with chiles, [[manioc]] and other tubers, various grains, and with animal protein from domestic dogs, turkeys, and ducks, and from hunting.  They lived in thatched roof [[wattle-and-daub]] houses, grew cotton and tobacco, and conducted some long-distance trade in obsidian and other goods.&lt;ref&gt;Meighan and Nicholson, p. 44.&lt;/ref&gt;

Shaft tombs themselves are not encountered elsewhere in Mesoamerica and their nearest counterparts come from northwestern South America.&lt;ref&gt;Meighan and Nicholson, p. 50. Meighan and Nicholson state that one other example of a shaft tomb complex, dating from the [[Mesoamerican chronology|Late Postclassic]], 1000 years later, is found in [[Mixteca Alta]].&lt;/ref&gt;

===South American shaft tombs===
Shaft tombs also appear in northwestern South America in a somewhat later timeframe than western Mexico (e.g. 200-300 CE in northern Peru, later in other areas).  To Dorothy Hosler, Professor of Archaeology and Ancient Technology at [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology|MIT]], "The physical similarities between the northern South American and West Mexican tomb types are unmistakable."&lt;ref&gt;Hosler, [https://books.google.com/books?id=cB-PLQpbk-4C&amp;pg=PA16&amp;dq=shaft+tomb+mexico&amp;sig=_5fJCLp_oYNekzKLGzlRPGcezWw#PPA16,M1 p. 16].&lt;/ref&gt; while art historian George Kubler finds that the western Mexican chambers "resemble the shafted tombs of the upper Cauca river in Colombia".&lt;ref&gt;Kubler, p. 191.&lt;/ref&gt;  However, others  disagree that the similarity of form demonstrates cultural linkages—Karen Olsen Bruhns states that "this sort of contact . . . seems mainly in the (muddled) eye of the synthesizer".&lt;ref&gt;Bruhns, p. 368.&lt;/ref&gt;

However, other linkages between Western Mexico and northwestern South America have been proposed, in particular the development of metallurgy.&lt;ref&gt;Hosler's essay focuses on this linkage.&lt;/ref&gt; See [[Metallurgy in pre-Columbian Mesoamerica]].

[[File:Western Mexico Shaft tomb house 3.jpg|right|300px|thumb|A ceramic house showing the distinctive roof associated not only with the shaft tomb cultures but the subsequent [[Teuchitlan tradition]] as well.  It has been proposed that these models show the house of the living above and attached to the house of the dead.&lt;ref&gt;Coe, p. 58.&lt;/ref&gt;]]

==History of scholarly research==
The first major work to discuss artifacts associated with the shaft tomb tradition was [[Carl Sofus Lumholtz|Carl Lumholtz]]'s 1902 work, ''Unknown Mexico''.  Along with illustrations of several of the grave goods, the Norwegian explorer described a looted shaft tomb he had visited in 1896.  He also visited and described the ruins of [[Tzintzuntzan (Mesoamerican site)|Tzintzuntzan]], the seat of [[Purépecha Empire]] some 150 miles (250&amp;nbsp;km) to the east, and was one of the first to incorrectly use the term "Tarascan" (Purépecha) to describe the shaft tomb artifacts.&lt;ref&gt;Meighan and Nicholson, p. 33.  Crossley.&lt;/ref&gt;

During the 1930s, artist [[Diego Rivera]] began accumulating many Western Mexico artifacts for his private collection, a personal interest that sparked a wider public interest in West Mexican grave goods.&lt;ref&gt;Sund, p. 2.&lt;/ref&gt;  It was in the late 1930s that one of the most prominent of Western Mexico archaeologists, [[Isabel Truesdell Kelly]], began her investigations.  In the period from 1944 until 1985, Kelly would eventually publish over a dozen scholarly papers on her work in this region.  In 1948, she was the first to hypothesize the existence of the "shaft tomb arc", the geographic distribution of shaft tomb sites over western Mexico (see map above).&lt;ref&gt;Meighan and Nicholson, p. 36.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1946, Salvador Toscano challenged the attribution of shaft tomb artifacts to the Purépechans,&lt;ref&gt;See Sund, [http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m0422/is_4_82/ai_69411773/pg_32 p. 32].&lt;/ref&gt; a challenge that was echoed in 1957 by [[Miguel Covarrubias]] who firmly declared that [[Purépecha culture]] appeared only "after the 10th century".&lt;ref&gt;Covarrubias, pp. 97.&lt;/ref&gt;  Toscano's and Covarrubias's views were later upheld by radiocarbon dating of plundered shaft tombs' charcoal and other organic remains salvaged in the 1960s by Diego Delgado and Peter Furst.  As the result of these excavations and his ethnological investigations of the modern-day indigenous [[Huichol people|Huichol]] and [[Cora people]]s of Nayarit, Furst proposed that the artifacts were not only mere representations of ancient peoples, but also contained deeper significance.  The model houses, for example, showed the living dwelling in context with the dead – a miniature [[cosmogram]] – and the horned warriors (as discussed above) were shaman battling mystical forces.&lt;ref&gt;See Coe, p. 58.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1974, Hasso von Winning published an exhaustive classification of Western Mexico shaft tomb artifacts (including, for example, the Chinesco A through D types mentioned above), a classification still largely in use today.&lt;ref&gt;Among others, see Meighan and Nicholson, p. 58.&lt;/ref&gt;

The 1993 discovery of an unlooted shaft tomb at Huitzilapa is the latest major milestone, providing "the most detailed information to date on the funerary customs" associated with shaft tomb tradition.&lt;ref&gt;López Mestas C. and Jorge Ramos de la Vega, p. 271.&lt;/ref&gt;

Women have engaged in [[philosophy]] throughout the field's history. While there were women [[philosopher]]s since ancient times, and a relatively small number were accepted as philosophers during the [[ancient philosophy|ancient]], [[Medieval philosophy|medieval]], [[Modern philosophy|modern]] and [[Contemporary philosophy|contemporary]] eras, particularly during the 20th and 21st century, almost no woman philosophers have entered the philosophical [[Western canon]].&lt;ref name="Duran, Jane 2005"&gt;Duran, Jane. Eight women philosophers: theory, politics, and feminism. University of Illinois Press, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="read.hipporeads.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://read.hipporeads.com/why-i-left-academia-philosophys-homogeneity-needs-rethinking/#|title=Why I Left Academia: Philosophy’s Homogeneity Needs Rethinking - Hippo Reads|author=|date=|website=read.hipporeads.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[ancient philosophy]] in the West, while academic philosophy was typically the domain of male philosophers such as [[Plato]] and [[Aristotle]], female philosophers such as [[Hipparchia of Maroneia]] (active ca. 325 BC), [[Arete of Cyrene]] (active 5th–4th century BC) and [[Aspasia of Miletus]] (470–400 BC) were active during this period. Notable [[medieval philosophy|medieval philosophers]] include [[Hypatia]] (5th century), [[St. Hildegard of Bingen]] (1098-1179) and [[St. Catherine of Sienna]] (1347-1380). Notable [[Modern philosophy|modern philosophers]] included [[Mary Wollstonecraft]] (1759-1797) and [[Sarah Margaret Fuller]] (1810-1850). Influential [[Contemporary philosophy|contemporary philosophers]] include [[Susanne Langer]] (1895–1985), [[Hannah Arendt]] (1906–1975), [[Simone de Beauvoir]] (1908–1986), [[Mary Midgley]] (born 1919), [[Mary Warnock]] (born 1924), [[Julia Kristeva]] (born 1941), [[Patricia Churchland]] (born 1943) and [[Susan Haack]] (born 1945).

In the early 1800s, some colleges and universities in the UK and US began [[Mixed-sex education#Higher-education institutions|admitting women]], giving rise to new generations of female academics. Nevertheless, [[U.S. Department of Education]] reports from the 1990s indicate that [[philosophy]] is one of the least proportionate fields in the [[humanities]] with respect to gender.&lt;ref name="Salary, Promotion 1997"&gt;"Salary, Promotion, and Tenure Status of Minority and Women Faculty in U.S. Colleges and Universities."National Center for Education Statistics, Statistical Analysis Report, March 2000; U.S. Department of Education, Office of Education Research and Improvement, Report # NCES 2000–173;1993 National Study of Postsecondary Faculty (NSOPF:93).

In the early 1990s, the [[Canadian Philosophical Association]] claimed that there is gender imbalance and [[gender bias]] in the academic field of philosophy.&lt;ref name="nas.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nas.org/articles/women_in_philosophy_problems_with_the_discrimination_hypothesis|title=Women in Philosophy: Problems with the Discrimination Hypothesis - National Association of Scholars|author=|date=|website=www.nas.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; In June 2013, a US sociology professor stated that "out of all recent citations in four prestigious philosophy journals, female authors comprise just 3.6 percent of the total." The editors of the [[Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy]] have raised concerns about the underrepresentation of women philosophers, and they require editors and writers to ensure they represent the contributions of women philosophers.&lt;ref name="nas.org"/&gt; According to Eugene Sun Park, "[p]hilosophy is predominantly white and predominantly male. This homogeneity exists in almost all aspects and at all levels of the discipline."&lt;ref name="read.hipporeads.com"/&gt; Susan Price argues that the philosophical "...canon remains dominated by white males—the discipline that...still hews to the myth that genius is tied to gender."&lt;ref name="theatlantic.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/education/archive/2015/05/reviving-the-female-canon/393110/|title=Reviving the Female Canon|first=Susan|last=Price|date=13 May 2015|website=theatlantic.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Saul, "[p]hilosophy, the oldest of the [[humanities]], is also the malest (and the whitest).  While other areas of the humanities are at or near gender parity, philosophy is actually more overwhelmingly male than even mathematics."&lt;ref name="salon.com"/&gt;

==Representation and working climate==
[[File:Martha Nussbaum wikipedia 10-10.jpg|thumb|right|200px|American philosopher [[Martha Nussbaum]], who completed a PhD in philosophy at [[Harvard University]] in 1975, alleges that she encountered a tremendous amount of discrimination at Harvard, including sexual harassment and problems getting childcare.&lt;ref name="berkeley.edu"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://globetrotter.berkeley.edu/people6/Nussbaum/nussbaum-con1.html|title=Conversation with Martha C. Nussbaum, p. 1 of 6|work=berkeley.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt; ]]
In the early 1990s, the [[Canadian Philosophical Association]] claimed that "...there is compelling evidence" of "...philosophy’s gender imbalance" and "bias and partiality in many of its theoretical products." In 1992, the association recommended that "fifty percent of [philosophy]...positions should be filled by women.”&lt;ref name="nas.org"/&gt; In a 2008 article “Changing the Ideology and Culture of Philosophy: Not by Reason (Alone),” MIT philosophy professor [[Sally Haslanger]] stated that the top twenty graduate programs in philosophy in the US have from 4 percent to 36 percent women faculty.&lt;ref name="nas.org"/&gt; In June 2013, Duke University professor of sociology Kieran Healy stated that "out of all recent citations in four prestigious philosophy journals, female authors comprise just 3.6 percent of the total." The editors of the [[Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy]] have raised concerns about the underrepresentation of women philosophers; as such, the encyclopedia “encourage[s] [their] authors, subject editors, and referees to help ensure that SEP entries do not overlook the work of women or indeed of members of underrepresented groups more generally.”&lt;ref name="nas.org"/&gt;

In 2014, philosophy professors Neven Sesardic and Rafael De Clercq published an article entitled "Women in Philosophy: Problems with the Discrimination Hypothesis." The article states that a "...number of philosophers attribute the underrepresentation of women in philosophy largely to [[gender bias|bias against women]] or some kind of wrongful [[discrimination]]". Evidence cited includes "gender disparities that increase along the path from undergraduate student to full-time faculty member"; "anecdotal accounts of discrimination in philosophy"; "research on gender bias in the evaluation of manuscripts, grants, and curricula vitae in other academic disciplines"; "psychological research on implicit bias"; "psychological research on [[stereotype threat]]" and the "...relatively small number of articles written from a feminist perspective in leading philosophy journals".&lt;ref name="nas.org"/&gt; Sesardic and De Clercq argue that "proponents of the discrimination hypothesis, who include distinguished philosophers ...have tended to present evidence selectively."&lt;ref name="nas.org"/&gt;

American philosopher [[Sally Haslanger]] stated in 2008 that "...it is very hard to find a place in philosophy that isn’t actively hostile towards women and minorities, or at least assumes that a successful philosopher should look and act like a (traditional, white) man.”&lt;ref name="theguardian.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2015/jul/25/philosphy-women-warnock-baggini-debate|title=Does philosophy have a problem with women?|first1=Mary|last1=Warnock|first2=Julian|last2=Baggini|date=25 July 2015|website=the Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt; Haslanger states that she experienced “occasions when a woman’s status in graduate school was questioned because she was married, or had a child (or had taken time off to have a child so was returning to philosophy as a ‘mature’ student), or was in a long-distance relationship". American philosopher [[Martha Nussbaum]], who completed a PhD in philosophy at [[Harvard University]] in 1975, alleges that she encountered a tremendous amount of discrimination during her studies at Harvard, including sexual harassment and problems getting childcare for her daughter.&lt;ref name="berkeley.edu"/&gt;

In July 2015, British philosopher [[Mary Warnock]] addressed the issue of the representation of women in British university philosophy departments, where 25% of faculty are women. Warnock stated she is "... against intervention, by [[Hiring quota|quota]]s or otherwise, to increase women’s chances of employment" in philosophy.&lt;ref name="theguardian.com"/&gt; She also argues that "... there is nothing intrinsically harmful about this imbalance" and she states that she does not "...believe it shows a conscious bias against women." &lt;ref name="theguardian.com"/&gt; Philosopher [[Julian Baggini]] states that he believes that there is "...little or no conscious discrimination against women in philosophy". At the same time, Baggini states that there may be a "...great deal of unconscious bias" against women in philosophy, because philosophy generally does not address issues of gender or ethnicity.&lt;ref name="theguardian.com"/&gt;

===Allegations of sexual harassment===
In 2014, ''[[Inside Higher Education]]'' described the philosophy "...discipline’s own long history of misogyny and sexual harassment."&lt;ref name="insidehighered.com"/&gt; On March 28, 2011, the blog ''New APPS'' published a post examining the allegations of persistent [[sexual harassment]] faced by women professors in philosophy, due largely to "serial harassers" continuing to work in the field despite widespread knowledge of their actions. The post proposed that, since institutional procedures seemed to have been ineffective at removing or punishing harassers, philosophers should socially shun known offenders.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.newappsblog.com/2011/03/what-is-to-be-done-about-sexual-harassment-in-the-philosophy-profession.html What is to be done about sexual harassment in the philosophy profession? – New APPS: Art, Politics, Philosophy, Science].

According to Heidi Lockwood, an associate professor of philosophy at [[Southern Connecticut State University]], there is a "...power “asymmetry” between professors and students – even graduate students"; as well, she noted that "...even when colleges and universities have blanket prohibitions against professor-student sexual relationships, as does Yale,...institution-specific policies leave students vulnerable [to sexual advances from faculty] at conferences."&lt;ref name="insidehighered.com"/&gt;
 
According to an August 2013 article in ''Salon'', a tenured male University of Miami philosopher resigned after allegedly "...sending emails to a [female] student in which he suggested that they have sex three times."&lt;ref name="salon.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.salon.com/2013/08/15/philosophy_has_a_sexual_harassment_problem/|title=Philosophy has a sexual harassment problem|author=|date=15 August 2013|website=salon.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Jennifer Saul]], a professor of philosophy at the [[University of Sheffield]], set up a blog for women philosophers in 2010. She received numerous allegations of [[sexual harassment]] by male philosophy faculty, including a "job candidate who said she was sexually assaulted at the annual APA meeting where job interviews take place", an "undergraduate whose professor joked publicly about dripping hot wax on her nipples" and a "... lesbian who found herself suddenly invited, after she came out, to join in the sexualizing of her female colleagues." Saul states that philosophy departments failed to deal with the allegations.&lt;ref name="salon.com"/&gt; In 2013, the [[American Philosophical Association]] formed a committee to study the allegations of sexual harassment of women students and professors by male philosophy faculty.&lt;ref name="insidehighered.com"/&gt; Saul states that one of the allegations was regarding a "...distinguished visiting speaker whose first words are: “Show me a grad student I can fuck”." &lt;ref name="ReferenceC"/&gt; Saul states that women are "...leaving philosophy after being harassed, assaulted, or retaliated against." &lt;ref name="ReferenceC"/&gt; In 2014, ''Inside Higher Education'' reported allegations that a [[Yale University]] philosophy professor had sexually harassed a woman; the "alleged victim says she reported the professor to Yale, with no real result".&lt;ref name="insidehighered.com"/&gt;
In an interview with ''Inside Higher Ed'', the alleged victim stated that she "...suffers from [[post-traumatic stress disorder]] that impedes everyday life, not only from the alleged attack but also from the “browbeating” she endured as she attempted to report the professor, again and again, to Yale officials."&lt;ref name="insidehighered.com"/&gt;

In 1993, the [[American Philosophical Association]]'s sexual harassment committee set out guidelines for addressing this issue in philosophy departments. The APA guidelines, which were revised in 2013, stated that:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.apaonline.org/?harassment|title=Statement on Sexual Harassment - The American Philosophical Association|author=|date=|website=www.apaonline.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*"Sexual advances, requests for sexual favors, or sexually directed remarks constitute sexual harassment when submission to such conduct is made a condition of academic or employment decisions, or when such conduct persists despite its rejection."
*"Sexual harassment is a serious violation of professional ethics, and should be regarded and treated as such by members of the profession. Sexual harassment is a form of prohibited discrimination when an institution or individual employee is aware of a sexually hostile environment and condones, tolerates or allows that environment to exist. Colleges and universities should supply clear, fair institutional procedures under which charges of sexual harassment on campus can be brought, assessed, and acted on."
*"Complaints of sexual harassment at APA-sponsored activities should be brought to the chair of the committee for the defense of professional rights of philosophers or, if they arise in the context of placement activities, to the APA ombudsperson. Complaints of sexual harassment by or against APA staff members should be brought to the chair of the board."

===Black women===

There are few black women philosophers, which includes women of African and Caribbean ancestry, [[African-American]]s and other individuals from the [[African diaspora]]. According to philosopher [[Sally Haslanger]], the "numbers of philosophers of color, especially women of color, is even more appalling"; in a 2003 study, there "...was insufficient data for any racial group of women other than white women to report." &lt;ref name="opinionator.blogs.nytimes.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://opinionator.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/09/02/women-in-philosophy-do-the-math/?_r=0|title=Women in Philosophy? Do the Math|first=Sally|last=Haslanger|date=|website=nytimes.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the United States, the "...representation of scholars of color is plausibly worse than in any other field in the academy, including not only physics, but also engineering."&lt;ref name="opinionator.blogs.nytimes.com"/&gt;  According to professor L.K. McPherson, there is a "gross underrepresentation of blacks in philosophy."&lt;ref name="newappsblog.com"&gt;L.K. McPherson. On Black Underrepresentation and Progress in the Profession. December 12, 2011. http://www.newappsblog.com/2011/12/new-apps-on-black-underrepresentation-and-progress-in-the-profession.html&lt;/ref&gt;  McPherson states that there is a "...willful, not necessarily a conscious, preference among many members of the philosophy profession largely to maintain the status quo in terms of: the social group profiles of members; the dynamics of prestige and influence; and the areas and questions deemed properly or deeply 'philosophical.' None of this is good for black folk."&lt;ref name="newappsblog.com"/&gt;

The first black woman in the US to do a PhD in philosophy was [[Joyce Mitchell Cook]], who obtained her degree in 1965 from [[Yale University]]. LaVerne Shelton was also one of the earliest black women to receive a PhD in philosophy. Other notable women include [[Angela Davis]], a political activist who specializes in writing about [[feminism]], [[critical theory]], [[Marxism]], [[popular music]], [[social consciousness]], and the philosophy of punishment and prisons; [[Kathryn Gines]], the founding director of the Collegium of Black Woman Philosophers, who specializes in [[continental philosophy]], [[Africana philosophy]], [[Race theory|philosophy of race]] and Black [[feminist philosophy]]; [[Anita L. Allen]], the first African-American woman to complete both a JD and a PhD in philosophy, who focuses on political and legal philosophy, and who in 2010 was appointed by [[President Obama]] to sit on the Presidential Commission for the Study of Bioethical Issues; and [[Adrian Piper]], an analytical philosopher who received a PhD in philosophy from Harvard; Jaqueline Scott, who received a PhD in philosophy from [[Stanford University]], and who specializes in [[Nietzsche]], nineteenth-century philosophy, race theory and [[African-American philosophy]].

=== Asian women ===
Few Asian women are recognized in contemporary Western philosophy. In a [[The New York Times|New York Times]] interview&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://opinionator.blogs.nytimes.com/2015/04/06/asian-american-woman-philosopher/|title=Asian, American, Woman, Philosopher|last=Yancy|first=George|last2=Lee|first2=Emily S.|date=2015-04-06|website=Opinionator|language=en-US|access-date=2018-05-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; with [[George Yancy]], Korean-American philosopher Emily S. Lee, assistant professor of philosophy at [[California State University, Fullerton]], states, "I wonder if some of my experiences occur from being Asian-American, in the ways people stereotypically assume that I must specialize in certain areas of philosophy or behave in specific ways, such as being quiet and subdued." She postulates that the social forces that stereotype and encourage Asian-Americans to enter more lucrative and secure fields (such as engineering or medicine) combined with influences within the field of philosophy discouraging Asian-American youths from continuing their study in the field has led to the extremely small population of Asian-American female philosophers. [[University of Washington]] philosophy professor Carole Lee's report in the [[American Philosophical Association]]'s newsletter on Asian and Asian-American Philosophers and Philosophies suggests&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://c.ymcdn.com/sites/www.apaonline.org/resource/collection/2EAF6689-4B0D-4CCB-9DC6-FB926D8FF530/AsianV14n1.pdf|title=Asian Americans, Positive Stereotyping, and Philosophy|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; that Asian women face conflicting stereotypes, making it difficult for them to fit into the field of philosophy: "Women are stereotyped as submissive rather than aggressive and as being bad at math: they lack both characteristics associated with philosophy." On the other had, "Asian Americans are stereotyped as being mathematical; however, they are characterized in ''passive'' rather than aggressive terms." Philosopher David Kim offers the explanation that a lack of Asian American mentors in philosophy and "derogation of philosophical thought that resonates with their identity" may also contribute to the wide disparity.

==Reports from the US ==
[[U.S. Department of Education]] reports indicate that [[philosophy]] is one of the least proportionate fields in the [[humanities]] with respect to gender.&lt;ref name="Salary, Promotion 1997"/&gt; Although reports indicate that philosophy as a professional field is disproportionately male, no clear, unequivocal data exists on the number of women currently in philosophy, or indeed, on the number of men in philosophy, and it is debatable how to define what it means to be ‘in philosophy.’ This can variously be defined as the current number of Ph.D. holders in philosophy, the current number of women teaching philosophy in two- and four- year institutions of higher learning either/both full-time and/or part-time (no one [[data set]] exists which measures these), or the current number of living women with publications in philosophy. The lack of clear data makes it difficult to establish gender proportions, but the consensus among those who have tried to arrive at an estimate is that women make up between 17% and 30% of academically employed philosophers.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

The [[National Center for Education Statistics]]' 2000 report, "Salary, Promotion, and Tenure Status of Minority and Women Faculty in U.S. Colleges and Universities," estimates in Table 23 that the total number of "History and Philosophy" U.S. citizens and full-time faculty who primarily taught in 1992 was 19,000, of which 79% were men (i.e. 15,010 men in history and philosophy), 21% were women (3,990). They add, "In fact, men were at least twice as likely as women to teach history and philosophy."&lt;ref&gt;NCES (2000), previously cited.&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Anita L Allen.JPG|thumb|left|180px|[[Anita L. Allen]] (born 1953) is a professor of law and professor of philosophy at the [[University of Pennsylvania Law School]].]]
In their 1997 report, "[http://nces.ed.gov/pubs97/97973.pdf Characteristics and Attitudes of Instructional Faculty and Staff in the Humanities]," NCES notes, that about "one-half of full-time instructional faculty and staff in 4-year institutions in English and literature (47 percent) and foreign languages (50 percent) were female in the fall of 1992, compared with less than one-half of instructional faculty and staff in history (24 percent) and philosophy and religion (13 percent) (table 4)." In this report they measure Philosophy and Religion in the same data set, and estimate the total number of full-time instructional Philosophy and Religion faculty and staff in 4-yr institutions to be 7,646. Of these, 87.3% are male (6675 men),
12.7 are female (971 women).&lt;ref&gt;NCES (1997), previously cited.&lt;/ref&gt; The 1997 report measures History Full-time instructional faculty and staff in 4-yr institutions to be 11,383; male:76.3 (8,686 men);
female: 23.7 (2,697 women). The numbers of women in philosophy from the two studies are not easily comparable, but one rough method may be to subtract the number of women in history in the 1997 report from the number of women estimated to be in 'history and philosophy' in the 2000 report. Doing so suggests that as a rough estimate, 1,293 women are employed as instructors of philosophy.

The 1997 report indicates that a large portion of all humanities instructors are part-time.&lt;ref&gt;NCES (1997): "Forty-two percent of all instructional faculty and staff were employed part time by their institution in the fall of 1992. Forty-five percent of [all U.S.] humanities faculty were employed part time."&lt;/ref&gt; Part-time employees are disproportionately female but not majority female.&lt;ref&gt;NCES (1997): "Part-time faculty members were more likely to be female (45 percent) than full-time faculty (33 percent), although the majority of both part- and full-time faculty were male (55 percent and 67 percent, respectively)."&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, considerations of full-time employees only necessarily leave out data on many women working part-time to remain active in their field. In 2004, the percentage of Ph.D.s in philosophy, within the U.S., going to women reached a record high percentage: 33.3%, or 121 of the 363 doctorates awarded.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.norc.uchicago.edu/issues/sed-2004.pdf Hoffer, T.B., V.

* Differential treatment: male and female university students may be treated differently in the  classroom.
* Vicious circle: female students do not feel inclined to study philosophy because of a lack of contact with female philosophy professors. 
* Misleading statistics: university administrators focus on gender representation in the humanities overall, which obscures the disparity in philosophy.&lt;ref name="lemmingsblog.blogspot.com"/&gt;

While there were women philosophers since the earliest times, and some were accepted as philosophers during their lives, almost no woman philosophers have entered the philosophical [[Western canon]].&lt;ref name="Duran, Jane 2005"/&gt;  Historians of philosophy are faced with two main problems. The first being the exclusion of women philosophers from history and philosophy texts, which leads to a lack of knowledge about women philosophers among philosophy students. The second problem deals with what the canonical philosophers had to say about philosophy and women's place in it. In the past twenty-five years there has been an exponential increase in feminist writing about the history of philosophy and what has been considered the philosophical canon.&lt;ref&gt;Witt, Charlotte and Shapiro, Lisa, "Feminist History of Philosophy", The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy (Spring 2015 Edition), Edward N. Zalta (ed.), URL = &lt;http://plato.stanford.edu/archives/spr2015/entries/feminism-femhist/&gt;.
  http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/feminism-femhist/&lt;/ref&gt; According to Eugene Sun Park, "[p]hilosophy is predominantly white and predominantly male. This homogeneity exists in almost all aspects and at all levels of the discipline." &lt;ref name="read.hipporeads.com"/&gt; According to [[Jennifer Saul]], a professor of philosophy at the University of Sheffield, "[p]hilosophy, the oldest of the humanities, is also the malest (and the whitest).  While other areas of the humanities are at or near gender parity, philosophy is actually more overwhelmingly male than even mathematics."&lt;ref name="salon.com"/&gt;

In the May 13, 2015 issue of ''The Atlantic'', Susan Price notes that even though Kant's first work in 1747 cites [[Emilie du Chatelet|Émilie Du Châtelet]], a philosopher who was a "...scholar of Newton, religion, science, and mathematics", "her work won’t be found in the 1,000-plus pages of the new edition of The Norton Introduction to Philosophy." &lt;ref name="theatlantic.com"/&gt; The Norton Introduction does not name a female philosopher until the book begins to cover the mid-20th century. Scholars argue that women philosophers are also absent from the "...other leading anthologies used in university classrooms." &lt;ref name="theatlantic.com"/&gt; Price states that university philosophy anthologies do not usually mention 17th century women philosophers such as [[Margaret Cavendish]], [[Anne Conway (philosopher)|Anne Conway]], and [[Lady Damaris Masham]].&lt;ref name="theatlantic.com"/&gt; Price argues that the philosophical "...canon remains dominated by white males—the discipline that some say still hews to the myth that genius is tied to gender."&lt;ref name="theatlantic.com"/&gt; Amy Ferrer, executive director of the American Philosophical Association, states that “...women have been systematically left out of the canon, and that women coming in have not been able to see how much influence women have had in the field."&lt;ref name="theatlantic.com"/&gt; ''The Encyclopedia of Philosophy'', which as published in 1967, had "...articles on over 900 philosophers, [but it] did not include an entry for [[Mary Wollstonecraft|Wollstonecraft]], [[Hannah Arendt|Arendt]] or [[Simone de Beauvoir|de Beauvoir]]. "[T]hese women philosophers were scarcely even marginal" to the canon set out at the time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://plato.stanford.edu/archives/spr2017/entries/feminism-femhist/|title=The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy|first1=Charlotte|last1=Witt|first2=Lisa|last2=Shapiro|editor-first=Edward N.|editor-last=Zalta|date=11 July 2018|publisher=Metaphysics Research Lab, Stanford University|via=Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Explaining the very small number of women philosophers, American academic and social critic [[Camille Paglia]] (born 1947) argues that "...women in general are less comfortable than men in inhabiting a highly austere, cold, analytical space, such as the one which philosophy involves. Women as a whole ...are more drawn to practical, personal matters. It is not that they inherently lack a talent or aptitude for philosophy or higher mathematics, but rather that they are more unwilling than men to devote their lives to a frigid space from which the natural and the human have been eliminated."&lt;ref name="independent.co.uk"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/this-britain/ten-great-female-philosophers-the-thinking-womans-women-299061.html|title=Ten great female philosophers: The thinking woman's women|author=|date=|website=independent.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt; Paglia claims that "[t]oday's lack of major female philosophers is not due to lack of talent but to the collapse of philosophy", because, in her view, philosophy "... as traditionally practised may be a dead genre" that "belongs to a vanished age of much slower and rhetorically formal inquiry."&lt;ref name="independent.co.uk"/&gt;

[[File:Hipparchia of Maroneia Villa Farnesina.jpg|thumb|right|200px| [[Hipparchia of Maroneia]]. Detail from a Roman wall painting in the [[Villa Farnesina]] in [[Rome]].]]
Some of the earliest philosophers were women, such as [[Hipparchia of Maroneia]] (active ca. 325 BC), [[Arete of Cyrene]] (active 5th–4th century BC) and [[Aspasia of Miletus]] (470–400 BC). Aspasia appears in the philosophical writings of [[Plato]], [[Xenophon]], Aeschines Socraticus and [[Antisthenes]]. Some scholars argue that Plato was impressed by her intelligence and wit and based his character [[Diotima of Mantinea|Diotima]] in the ''[[Symposium (Plato)|Symposium]]'' on her.&lt;ref name="Wider1986"&gt;K. Wider, "Women philosophers in the Ancient Greek World", 21–62&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Sykoutris"&gt;I. Sykoutris, ''Symposium (Introduction and Comments)'', 152–153&lt;/ref&gt; [[Socrates]] attributes to the (possibly fictional) [[Diotima of Mantinea]] his lessons in the art of Eros (or philosophical searching). [[Plato]]'s final views on women are highly contested, but the ''Republic'' suggests that women are equally capable of education, intellectual vision, and rule of the city.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Garside|first1=Christine|title=Plato on Women|journal=Feminist Studies|date=1975|pages=131–138|jstor=3177773|volume=2}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name='Jacobs, William "Platon on Female Emancipation and the Traditional Family"'&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Jacobs|first1=William|title=Plato on Female Emancipation and the Traditional Family|journal=Apeiron|date=June 1978|volume=12|issue=1|pages=29–31|doi=10.1515/apeiron.1978.12.1.29|jstor=40913404}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other notable philosophers include:
*[[Theano of Croton]] (6th century BC)
*[[Aristoclea of Delphi]] (6th century BC)
*[[Sosipatra of Ephesus]] (4th century BC)
*[[Nicarete of Megara]] (flourished around 300 BC)

[[Medieval philosophy]] dates from the fall of the Western Roman Empire in the 5th century AD to the Renaissance in the 16th century. [[Hypatia]] (AD 350 – 370 to 415) was a [[Greeks|Greek]] [[mathematician]], astronomer, and philosopher in [[Roman Egypt|Egypt]], then a part of the [[Eastern Roman Empire]].&lt;ref name="socrates"&gt;{{Cite book|title= Ecclesiastical History|last= Scholasticus|first= Socrates |authorlink= Socrates Scholasticus |year= |publisher= |location= |isbn= |url = http://cosmopolis.com/alexandria/hypatia-bio-socrates.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; She was the head of the [[Neoplatonic]] school at [[Alexandria]], where she taught [[philosophy]] and [[astronomy]].&lt;ref&gt;Krebs, ''Groundbreaking Scientific Experiments, Inventions, and Discoveries''; ''The Cambridge Dictionary of Philosophy, 2nd edition, Cambridge University Press, 1999: ''"Greek Neoplatonist philosopher who lived and taught in Alexandria."''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title= Women of Mathematics: A Biobibliographic Sourcebook |last1=Mueller |first1=I. |authorlink= |author2=L.S.

*[[Moderata Fonte]] (1555–1592), critic of religion, feminist

===Modern philosophy===
The 17th century marks the beginning of the [[modern philosophy]] era, which ended in the early 20th century. During the 17th century, various women philosophers argued for the importance of education for women and two women philosophers influenced [[René Descartes]] and during the early part of the 18th century, two women philosophers commented on [[John Locke]]’s philosophy. [[Laura Bassi]] (1711–1778) was the first woman to earn a university chair in a scientific field. [[Olympe de Gouges]] (1748–1793) demanded that French women be given the same rights as men, a position also taken by [[Judith Sargent Murray]] (1751–1820) in her essay "[[On the Equality of the Sexes]]" and [[Mary Wollstonecraft]] in her essay ''[[A Vindication of the Rights of Woman]]'' (1792). During the 19th century, [[Harriet Martineau]] (1802–1876)  criticized the state of women's education and [[Harriet Taylor Mill]] (1807–1858), [[Sarah Margaret Fuller]] (1810-1850) and [[Antoinette Brown Blackwell]] (1825–1921) called for [[women's rights]]. [[Charlotte Perkins Gilman]] (1860–1935) argued that women were oppressed by an [[androcentrism|androcentric]] culture. Near the start of the 20th century, [[Mary Whiton Calkins]] (1863–1930) was the first woman to become president of the [[American Philosophical Association]]. Women thinkers such as [[Emma Goldman]] (1869–1940), an [[anarchism|anarchist]], and
[[Rosa Luxemburg]] (1871–1919), a [[Marxist theory|Marxist theorist]], are known for their political views.

====17th century====
*[[Marie de Gournay]] (1565–1645) was a critic of religion, proto-feminist, translator and novelist who insisted that women should be educated.
*[[Anna Maria van Schurman]] (1607–1678) was a multilinguist known for her defense of [[female education]]. 
*[[Elisabeth of the Palatinate|Elisabeth of Bohemia]] (1618–1680) influenced many key figures and philosophers, most notably [[René Descartes]], who she corresponded with. She questioned Descartes' idea of [[Mind-body dualism|dualism]], or the mind being separate from the body, and his theories regarding communication between the mind and body. 
*[[Margaret Cavendish, Duchess of Newcastle-upon-Tyne|Margaret Cavendish]] (1623–1673) was a philosopher and writer who addressed gender, power, manners, scientific methods, and philosophy.
*[[Anne Conway (philosopher)|Anne Conway]] (1631-1679) was an [[English people|English]] [[philosopher]] whose work, in the tradition of the [[Cambridge Platonists]], was an influence on [[Gottfried Leibniz|Leibniz]]. Conway's thought is original as it is [[rationalist philosophy]], with hallmarks of gynocentric concerns and patterns, and in that sense it was unique among seventeenth-century systems.&lt;ref name="Duran2006"&gt;{{cite book|author=Jane Duran|title=Eight Women Philosophers: Theory, Politics, And Feminism|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=aIzVEF6J6SYC&amp;pg=PA73|accessdate=13 January 2013|year=2006|publisher=University of Illinois Press|isbn=978-0-252-03022-2|pages=73–}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Damaris Cudworth Masham]] (1659–1708) was an English philosopher, [[proto-feminist]], and advocate for women's education. 
*[[Mary Astell]] (1666–1731) was an English [[feminism|feminist]] writer and [[rhetorician]] known for advocacy of equal [[educational opportunities for women]], which earned her the title of "first English feminist."&lt;ref name="litencyc"&gt;Batchelor, Jennie.

[[File:FullerDaguerreotype.jpg|thumb|right|180px|The only known [[daguerreotype]] of [[Margaret Fuller]] (by [[John Plumbe]], 1846).]]
*[[Catharine Trotter Cockburn]] (1679–1749) published her first major philosophical work, ''A Defence of Mr. Lock[e]'s [[An Essay Concerning Human Understanding]]'' in 1702, at the age of 23. Much of the scholarly interest in her writing centres on [[gender studies]]. 
*[[Émilie du Châtelet]] (1706–1749) was a [[France|French]] mathematician, [[physicist]], and author during the [[Age of Enlightenment]]. She translated and commented on [[Isaac Newton]]'s work ''[[Philosophiae Naturalis Principia Mathematica]]''. She criticized [[John Locke]]’s philosophy and emphasizes the necessity of the verification of knowledge through experience. She also theorized about [[free will]] and on the way to do [[metaphysics]].&lt;ref&gt;Hagengruber (2011: 8-12,24,53,54)&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Laura Bassi]] (1711–1778) was an Italian philosopher and physicist who was the first woman in the world to earn a university chair in a scientific field of studies. She received a doctoral degree from the [[University of Bologna]] in May 1732,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title = Laura Bassi| work = MacTutor Biography| publisher = University of St Andrews| url = http://www-history.mcs.st-and.ac.uk/Biographies/Bassi.html| accessdate = 30 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; the third academic qualification ever bestowed on a woman by a university,&lt;ref name="Findlen, Paula"&gt;Findlen, Paula.

*[[Catharine Macaulay]] (1731–1791) was an English historian and writer. She attacked [[Edmund Burke]]'s ''[[Thoughts on the Cause of the Present Discontents]]'', calling it "a poison...".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hill|1992|p=74}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In her 1790 ''Letters on Education'', she argued along the lines that [[Mary Wollstonecraft]] would do in 1792, that the apparent weakness of women was due to their mis-education.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Walters, Margaret|year=2006|title=Feminism: A Very Short Introduction|location=USA|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=0-19-280510-X|page=30}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Olympe de Gouges]] (1748–1793) was a French playwright and political [[activism|activist]] whose [[feminism|feminist]] and [[Abolitionism in France|abolitionist]] writings reached a large audience. She was an early feminist who demanded that French women be given the same rights as French men. In her ''[[Declaration of the Rights of Woman and the Female Citizen]]'' (1791), she challenged the practice of [[patriarchy|male authority]] and the notion of male–female inequality. 
*[[Judith Sargent Murray]] (1751–1820) was an early [[United States|American]] advocate for women's rights, an essayist, [[playwright]], [[poet]], and letter writer. She was one of the first American proponents of the idea of the equality of the sexes—that women, like men, had the capability of intellectual accomplishment and should be able to achieve economic independence. Among many other influential pieces, her landmark essay "[[On the Equality of the Sexes]]" paved the way for new thoughts and ideas proposed by other [[Feminism|feminist]] writers of the century. The essay predated [[Mary Wollstonecraft]]'s ''[[A Vindication of the Rights of Woman]]'' which was published in 1792.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hughes|first1=Mary|title=An Enlightened Woman: Judith Sargent Murray and the Call to Equality|journal=[[Pittsburgh Undergraduate Review|Undergraduate Review]]|date=2011|volume=7|issue=21|url=http://vc.bridgew.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1196&amp;context=undergrad_rev|accessdate=25 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
*[[Mary Wollstonecraft]] (1759-1797) was an English writer, philosopher, and advocate of [[women's rights]]. She is regarded as one of the founding [[feminist philosophy|feminist philosophers]]. In ''[[A Vindication of the Rights of Woman]]'' (1792), her most famous and influential work,&lt;ref&gt;Tomalin, 144–155; Wardle, 115ff; Sunstein, 192–202.&lt;/ref&gt; she argues that women are not naturally inferior to men, but appear to be only because they lack education. She suggests that both men and women should be treated as rational beings and imagines a [[social order]] founded on reason.

====19th century====
*[[Harriet Martineau]] (1802–1876) was an English [[social theorist]] and political writer, often cited as the first female [[sociologist]].&lt;ref name="autogenerated2002"&gt;Hill, Michael R. (2002) [https://books.google.com/books?id=qyzyUpMfh24C&amp;printsec=frontcover ''Harriet Martineau: Theoretical and Methodological Perspectives'']. Routledge. {{ISBN|0-415-94528-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; She wrote books and essays from a sociological, holistic, religious, domestic, and feminine perspective.  In ''Society in America'', she criticised the state of women's education, stating that the "intellect of women is confined by an unjustifiable restriction" of access to education; she urged women to become well-educated and free.
*[[Harriet Taylor Mill]] (1807–1858) was a philosopher and [[women's rights]] advocate. In [[John Stuart Mill]]'s autobiography, he claimed she was the joint author of most of the books and articles published under his name. He stated that "when two persons have their thoughts and speculations completely in common it is of little consequence, in respect of the question of originality, which of them holds the pen." Together, they wrote "Early Essays on Marriage and Divorce", published in 1832.&lt;ref name=Tong&gt;{{cite book|author=Tong, Rosemarie|title=Feminist Thought: A More Comprehensive Introduction|year=2009|publisher=Westview Press (Perseus Books)|isbn=978-0-8133-4375-4|page=17}}&lt;/ref&gt; The debate about the nature and extent of her collaboration is ongoing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://plato.stanford.edu/search/searcher.py?query=harriet+taylor+mill|title=Search (Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy)|author=|date=|website=plato.stanford.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Sarah Margaret Fuller]] (1810-1850) was an American journalist, critic, philosopher and [[women's rights]] advocate. Her book ''[[Woman in the Nineteenth Century]]'' is considered the first major [[feminism|feminist]] work in the United States. She was an advocate of women's rights and, in particular, women's education and the right to employment. Many other advocates for women's rights and feminism, including [[Susan B. Anthony]], cite Fuller as a source of inspiration.
*[[Antoinette Brown Blackwell]] (1825–1921) was the first woman to be ordained as a mainstream Protestant minister in the [[United States]]. She was a well-versed public speaker on controversial issues such as [[abolition of slavery]] and she sought to expand [[women's rights]]. In 1873 Blackwell founded the Association for the Advancement of Women.
*[[Victoria, Lady Welby]] (1837–1912) was a self-educated English [[philosopher of language]]. She was published articles in the leading English language academic journals of the day, ''[[Mind (journal)|Mind]]'' and ''[[The Monist]]''. She published her first philosophical book, ''What Is Meaning?  Studies in the Development of Significance'' in 1903, following it with ''Significs and Language: The Articulate Form of Our Expressive and Interpretive Resources'' in 1911. Welby's concern with the problem of meaning included (perhaps especially) the everyday use of language, and she coined the word ''significs'' for her approach. Welby's theories on signification anticipated contemporary [[semantics]], [[semiotics]], and [[semiology]]. 
*[[Bertha von Suttner]] (1843–1914) was a [[Czechs|Czech]]-[[Austrians|Austrian]] [[Pacifism|pacifist]] and novelist. In 1905 she was the first woman to be awarded the [[Nobel Peace Prize]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/lists/women.html|title=Nobel Prize Awarded Women|author=|date=|website=www.nobelprize.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; Suttner's pacifism was influenced by the writings of [[Immanuel Kant]], [[Henry Thomas Buckle]], [[Herbert Spencer]], [[Charles Darwin]] and [[Leo Tolstoy]] (Tolstoy praised ''Die Waffen nieder!'').&lt;ref name="weop"&gt;''Bertha von Suttner'' by [[Irwin Adams]].

*[[Helene von Druskowitz]] (1856–1918) was an Austrian philosopher, writer and music critic. She was the second woman to obtain a Doctorate in Philosophy, which she obtained in [[Zürich]]. She usually published under a male alias because of the predominant [[sexism]] of the era.
*[[Charlotte Perkins Gilman]] (1860–1935) was an American [[feminist]], [[sociologist]], novelist, writer and [[social reform]]er. Her short story "[[The Yellow Wallpaper]]" became a bestseller. The story is about a woman who suffers from mental illness after three months of being closeted in a room by her husband. She argued that the domestic environment oppressed women through the patriarchal beliefs upheld by society.&lt;ref&gt;Ann J. Lane, ''To Herland and Beyond'', 230.&lt;/ref&gt; Gilman argued that women's contributions to civilization, throughout history, have been halted because of an [[androcentrism|androcentric]] culture. She argued that women were the underdeveloped half of humanity.&lt;ref&gt;Davis and Knight, ''Charlotte Perkins Gilman and Her Contemporaries'', 206.&lt;/ref&gt; She believed economic independence would bring freedom and equality for women.

====Early 20th century====
*[[Mary Whiton Calkins]] (1863–1930) was an American [[philosopher]] and [[psychologist]]. She was also the first woman to become president of the [[American Psychological Association]] and the [[American Philosophical Association]]. Calkins studied psychology under [[William James]] and studied at [[Harvard University]], which allowed her to attend courses but refused to register her as a student, because she was a woman. She published her doctoral dissertation in 1896, and Harvard's Department of Philosophy and Psychology recommended that she be granted her PhD, but Harvard's President and board refused, as she was a woman. The President believed women should not study with men.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Furumoto | first1 = L | year = 1980 | title = Mary Whiton Calkins (1863-1930) | url = | journal = Psychology of Women Quarterly | volume = 5 | issue = | pages = 55–68 | doi=10.1111/j.1471-6402.1981.tb01033.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Furumoto | first1 = L | year = 1979 | title = Mary Whiton Calkins (1863-1930) fourteenth president of the American Psychological Association | url = | journal = Journal of the History of the Behavioral Sciences | volume = 15 | issue = | pages = 346–356 | doi=10.1002/1520-6696(197910)15:4&lt;346::aid-jhbs2300150408&gt;3.0.co;2-z}}&lt;/ref&gt; James was astonished at the university's decision, as he described her performance as "the most brilliant examination for the Ph.D. that we have had at Harvard." &lt;ref name="Hilgard, E.

*[[Emma Goldman]] (1869–1940) was an [[anarchism|anarchist]] known for her political activism, writing and speeches. She played a pivotal role in the development of [[anarchist political philosophy]] in the first half of the 20th century. She was viewed as a [[free-thinking]] "rebel woman" by admirers, and denounced by critics as an advocate of violent revolution.&lt;ref name="Voices"&gt;{{cite book |last=Streitmatter|first=Rodger|title=Voices of Revolution: The Dissident Press in America|publisher=[[Columbia University Press]]|year =2001|location=New York|pages=122–134|isbn=0-231-12249-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her writing and lectures spanned a wide variety of issues, including [[atheism]], [[freedom of speech]], [[militarism]], [[capitalism]], marriage, [[free love]], and homosexuality. Although she distanced herself from [[first-wave feminism]] and its efforts toward [[women's suffrage]], she developed ways of incorporating gender politics into anarchism. 
*[[Rosa Luxemburg]] (1871–1919) was a [[Marxist theory|Marxist theorist]], [[Philosophy|philosopher]], [[Economics|economist]] and [[Revolutionary socialism|revolutionary socialist]] of [[Polish-Jewish]] descent. While Luxemburg defended Marx's materialism dialectics and his conception of history, she called for spontaneous [[grass roots]]-based [[class struggle]].

[[File:Hannah_arendt-150x150.jpg|thumb|right|200px|[[Hannah Arendt]] (1906–1975) considered herself a political theorist, but she is often described as a philosopher.]]
[[Contemporary philosophy]] is the present period in the history of [[Western philosophy]] beginning at the end of the 19th century with the [[professionalization]] of the discipline and the rise of [[Analytic philosophy|analytic]] and [[continental philosophy]]. Some influential women philosophers from this period include:
*[[Ayn Rand]] (1905-1982) developed a philosophical system she named [[Objectivism (Ayn Rand)|Objectivism]], which affirms [[objective reality]] and advocates holding [[reason]] as absolute.&lt;ref&gt;http://aynrandlexicon.com/lexicon/objectivity.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://aynrandlexicon.com/lexicon/reason.html&lt;/ref&gt; In [[ethics]], Rand championed [[rational egoism]] and [[individualism]].&lt;ref&gt;http://aynrandlexicon.com/lexicon/self-interest.html&lt;/ref&gt; In [[politics]], she advocated for [[individual rights]] and [[capitalism]].&lt;ref&gt;http://aynrandlexicon.com/lexicon/individual_rights.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://aynrandlexicon.com/lexicon/capitalism.html&lt;/ref&gt; In [[esthetics]],  she upheld [[romanticism]].&lt;ref&gt;http://aynrandlexicon.com/lexicon/romanticism.html&lt;/ref&gt; Rand regards [[Aristotle]] as her sole major philosophical influence.&lt;ref&gt;http://aynrandlexicon.com/lexicon/aristotle.html&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Susanne Langer]] (1895–1985) was an American [[philosopher]] of [[philosopher of mind|mind]] and of [[philosopher of art|art]], who was influenced by [[Ernst Cassirer]] and [[Alfred North Whitehead]]. She was one of the first women to achieve an academic career in [[philosophy]] and the first woman to be popularly and professionally recognized as an American philosopher. Langer is best known for her 1942 book entitled ''[[Philosophy in a New Key]]''. It argued that there is a basic and pervasive human need to symbolize, to invent meanings, and to invest meanings in one’s world.&lt;ref name="gardner1"&gt;{{Citation|author=[[Howard Gardner]]|title=Art, Mind, and Brain: A Cognitive Approach to Creativity|chapter=Philosophy in a New Key Revisited: An Appreciation of Susanne Langer |publisher=Basic Books|pages=48–54|location=New York|url=http://www.anthonyflood.com/gardnerlanger.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Hannah Arendt]] (1906–1975) was a [[Germany|German]]-born [[Americans|American]] [[Jewish assimilation|assimilated]] [[Jews|Jewish]] [[political theory|political theorist]]. Though often described as a philosopher, she rejected that label on the grounds that philosophy is concerned with "man in the singular" and instead described herself as a political theorist because her work centers on the fact that "men, not Man, live on the earth and inhabit the world."&lt;ref&gt;Arendt, Hannah. ''The Human Condition''. 2nd ed. Chicago: University of Chicago, 1998.&lt;!-- isbn needed --&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Her works deal with the nature of [[power (sociology)|power]], and the subjects of politics, [[direct democracy]], [[authority]], and [[totalitarianism]]. The [[Hannah Arendt Prize]] is named in her honor.
[[File:Simone de Beauvoir.jpg|thumb|right|160px|[[Simone de Beauvoir]] (1908–1986) was a French writer, intellectual, [[Existentialism|existentialist philosopher]], political activist, [[feminist]] and [[social theorist]].]]
*[[Simone de Beauvoir]] (1908–1986) was a French writer, intellectual, [[Existentialism|existentialist philosopher]], political activist, [[feminist]] and [[social theorist]]. Though she did not consider herself a philosopher, she had a significant influence on both [[feminist existentialism]] and [[feminist theory]].&lt;ref name="plato.stanford"&gt;Bergoffen, Debra, "Simone de Beauvoir", ''The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy'' (Fall 2010 Edition), Edward N. Zalta (ed.), URL = &lt;http://plato.stanford.edu/archives/fall2010/entries/beauvoir/&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt; De Beauvoir wrote novels, essays, biographies, autobiography and [[monograph]]s on philosophy, politics and social issues. She is known for her 1949 treatise ''[[The Second Sex]]'', a detailed analysis of women's oppression and a foundational tract of contemporary [[feminism]].
*[[Elizabeth Anscombe]] (1919–2001), usually cited as G. E. M. Anscombe, was a British [[analytic philosophy|analytic philosopher]]. Anscombe's 1958 article "[[Modern Moral Philosophy]]" introduced the term "[[consequentialism]]" into the language of analytic philosophy, and had a seminal influence on contemporary [[virtue ethics]]. Her monograph ''[[Intention (book)|Intention]]'' is generally recognised as her greatest and most influential work, and the continuing philosophical interest in the concepts of [[Intention (philosophy)|intention]], [[Action (philosophy)|action]] and [[practical reasoning]] can be said to have taken its main impetus from this work.  [[Mary Warnock]] described her in 2006 as "the undoubted giant among women philosophers" while [[John Joseph Haldane|John Haldane]] said she "certainly has a good claim to be the greatest woman philosopher of whom we know".&lt;ref name="Haldane"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Haldane|first=John|title=In Memoriam: G. E. M. Anscombe (1919–2001)|journal=The Review of Metaphysics|date=June 2000|volume=53|issue=4|pages=1019–1021|jstor=20131480}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Mary Midgley]] (born 1919) is an English [[ethics|moral philosopher]]. A senior lecturer in philosophy at [[Newcastle University]], she is known for her work on science, ethics and [[animal rights]]. Midgley strongly opposes [[reductionism]] and [[scientism]], and any attempts to make science a substitute for the humanities—a role for which it is, she argues, wholly inadequate. She has written extensively about what philosophers can learn from nature, particularly from animals. ''The Guardian'' has described her as a fiercely combative philosopher and the UK's "foremost scourge of 'scientific pretension.'"&lt;ref name=brown2001&gt;{{cite web|last=Brown|first=Andrew|title=Mary, Mary, quite contrary|url=https://www.theguardian.com/saturday_review/story/0,3605,421561,00.html|work=The Guardian|date=13 January 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Mary Warnock]] (born 1924) is a [[United Kingdom|British]] [[philosopher]] of [[ethics|morality]], [[philosophy of education|education]] and [[philosophy of mind|mind]], and writer on [[existentialism]]. From 1984 to 1991, she was [[Master (college)|Mistress]] of [[Girton College, Cambridge]]. Warnock studied at [[Lady Margaret Hall, Oxford|Lady Margaret Hall]], [[University of Oxford|Oxford]], and was made an Honorary Fellow in 1984. She delivered the [[Gifford Lectures]], entitled "Imagination and Understanding," at the [[University of Glasgow]] in 1992. She has written extensively on [[ethics]], [[existentialism]] and [[philosophy of mind]].&lt;ref name=Honderich&gt;{{cite book|last=Honderich|first=Ted|title=The Oxford Companion to Philosophy|year=1995|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=Oxford|isbn=0-19-866132-0|page=907|edition=1. publ.}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Philippa Foot]] (1920-2010) was a [[United Kingdom|British]] [[Philosophy|philosopher]], most notable for her works in [[ethics]]. She was one of the founders of contemporary [[virtue ethics]], inspired by the ethics of [[Aristotle]]. Her later career marked a significant change in view from her work in the 1950s and '60s, and may be seen as an attempt to modernize [[Aristotelianism|Aristotelian]] ethical theory, to show that it is adaptable to a contemporary world view, and thus, that it could compete with such popular theories as modern [[deontology|deontological]] and [[utilitarianism|utilitarian]] ethics.  Some of her work was crucial in the re-emergence of [[normative ethics]] within [[analytic philosophy]], especially her critique of [[consequentialism]] and of [[non-cognitivism]]. A familiar example is the continuing discussion of an example of hers referred to as the [[trolley problem]]. Foot's approach was influenced by the later work of [[Wittgenstein]], although she rarely dealt explicitly with materials treated by him.
*[[Patricia Churchland]] (born 1943) is a Canadian-American [[philosopher]] noted for her contributions to [[neurophilosophy]] and the [[philosophy of mind]]. She is UC President's professor of philosophy emerita at the [[University of California, San Diego]] (UCSD), where she has taught since 1984. Educated at the [[University of British Columbia]], the [[University of Pittsburgh]], and the [[University of Oxford]], she taught philosophy at the [[University of Manitoba]] from 1969 to 1984.
*[[Susan Haack]] (born 1945) is distinguished professor in the humanities, professor of philosophy, and professor of law at the University of Miami. She earned her PhD at [[Cambridge University]]. She has written on [[logic]], the [[philosophy of language]], [[epistemology]], and [[metaphysics]]. Her [[pragmatism]] follows that of [[Charles Sanders Peirce]]. Haack's major contribution to philosophy is her [[epistemology|epistemological]] theory called [[foundherentism]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Aune | first1 = B. | title = Haack's ''Evidence and Inquiry''| journal = Philosophy and Phenomenological Research | volume = 56 | issue = 3 | pages = 627–632 | doi = 10.2307/2108389 | year = 1996 | pmid =  | pmc = }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Flage | first1 = D.

'''Étienne Souriau''' ({{IPA-fr|suʁjo|lang}}; April 26, 1892 &amp;ndash; November 19, 1979) was a French philosopher, best known for his work in [[aesthetics]].

Son of [[Paul Souriau]], he studied at the [[École Normale Supérieure]] and received his ''[[agrégation|agrégation of philosophy]]'' in 1925. After teaching at the universities of [[Aix-en-Provence]] and [[Lyon]] he eventually became a professor at the [[University of Paris|Sorbonne]], where he held a chair in aesthetics. He was the editor of the ''[[Revue d'esthétique]]'' and was elected to the [[Académie des sciences morales et politiques]] in 1958. Recently, the works of [[Bruno Latour]] have reawoken interests on Souriau's oeuvre, specially his works on ontology and metaphysics regarding his theories of different modes of existence.
