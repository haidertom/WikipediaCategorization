The '''''AP 42 Compilation of Air Pollutant Emission Factors''''' is a compilation of the [[US Environmental Protection Agency]] (EPA)'s [[emission factor]] information on [[air pollution]], first published in 1968. {{As of |2018}}, the last edition is the 5th from 2010. 

==History==
The AP 42 Compilation of Air Pollutant Emission Factors is a compilation of [[emission factor]]s of [[Air pollution|air pollutants]], in other words numbers which relate the quantity of a pollutant released into the ambient air with a certain activity. This compilation was first compiled and published by the [[US Public Health Service]] in 1968. In 1972, it was revised and issued as the second edition by the [[US Environmental Protection Agency]] EPA. 
In 1985, the subsequent fourth edition was split into two volumes: Volume I has since included stationary [[Air pollution dispersion terminology|point and area source]] [[emission factor]]s, and Volume II includes [[Air pollution dispersion terminology|mobile source]] emission factors. Volume I is currently in its fifth edition and is available on the Internet.&lt;ref&gt;EPA [https://www.epa.gov/air-emissions-factors-and-quantification/ap-42-compilation-air-emission-factors AP 42, Volume I] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100924132127/http://www.epa.gov/ttn/chief/ap42/index.html |date=September 24, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; 
Volume II is no longer maintained as such, but [[roadway air dispersion model]]s for estimating emissions from onroad vehicles and from [[non-road vehicle]]s and mobile equipment are available on the Internet.&lt;ref&gt;EPA [http://www.epa.gov/otaq/models.htm Mobile source emission models] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160513041628/http://www.epa.gov/otaq/models.htm |date=May 13, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In routine common usage, Volume I of the emission factor compilation is very often referred to as simply ''AP 42''.

==Content==
Air pollution emission factors are usually expressed as the weight of the pollutant divided by a unit weight, volume, distance, or duration of the activity emitting the pollutant (e.g., kilograms of particulate matter emitted per megagram of coal burned). The factors help to estimate emissions from various sources of air pollution. In most cases, the factors are simply averages of all available data of acceptable quality, and are generally assumed to be representative of long-term averages. 

The equation for the estimation of emissions before [[Air pollution#Control devices|emission reduction controls]] are applied is:

:'''E = A × EF'''

and for emissions after reduction controls are applied:

:'''E = A × EF × (1-ER/100)'''

Chapter 5, Section 5.1 "Petroleum Refining" discusses the air pollutant emissions from the equipment in the various refinery processing units as well as from the auxiliary steam-generating boilers, furnaces and engines, and Table 5.1.1 includes the pertinent emission factors. Table 5.1.2 includes the emission factors for the fugitive air pollutant emissions from the large wet [[cooling tower]]s in [[Oil refinery|refineries]] and from the oil/water separators used in treating refinery [[wastewater]].

The fugitive air pollutant emission factors from [[safety valve|relief valves]], piping [[valves]], open-ended piping lines or drains, piping [[flange]]s,  sample connections, and [[mechanical seal|seals]] on [[pump]] and [[Gas compressor|compressor]] shafts are discussed and included the report EPA-458/R-95-017, "Protocol for Equipment Leak Emission Estimates" which is included in the Chapter 5 section of AP 42. That report includes the emission factors developed by the EPA for petroleum refineries and for the synthetic organic chemical industry (SOCMI).

In most cases, the emission factors in Chapter 5 are included for both ''uncontrolled'' conditions before emission reduction controls are implemented and ''controlled'' conditions after specified emission reduction methods are implemented.

Chapter 7 "Liquid Storage Tanks" is devoted to the methodology for calculating the emissions losses from the six basic tank designs used for organic liquid storage: [[Fixed roof tank|fixed roof]] (vertical and
horizontal), [[External_floating_roof_tank|external floating roof]], domed external (or covered) floating roof, internal floating roof, variable vapor space, and pressure (low and high). The methodology in Chapter 7 was developed by the [[American Petroleum Institute]] in collaboration with the EPA.

The EPA has developed a software program named "TANKS" which performs the Chapter 7 methodology for calculating emission losses from storage tanks.  The program's installer file along with a user manual, and the source code are available on the Internet.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.epa.gov/ttn/chief/software/tanks/index.html#order TANKS download site] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160305212130/http://www.epa.gov/ttn/chief/software/tanks/index.html#order |date=March 5, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Chapters 5 and 7 discussed above are illustrative of the type of information contained in the other chapters of AP 42. It should also be noted that many of the fugitive emission factors in Chapter 5 and the emissions calculation methodology in Chapter 7 and the TANKS program also apply to many other industrial categories besides the petroleum industry.

'''Alfred Tarski''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|t|ɑr|s|k|i}}; January 14, 1901 &amp;ndash; October 26, 1983), born '''Alfred Teitelbaum''',&lt;ref&gt;Alfred Tarski, [https://www.britannica.com/biography/Alfred-Tarski "Alfred Tarski"], ''Encyclopædia Britannica''.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Alfred Tarski"&gt;School of Mathematics and Statistics, University of St Andrews, [http://www-history.mcs.st-and.ac.uk/Biographies/Tarski.html "Alfred Tarski"], ''School of Mathematics and Statistics, University of St Andrews''.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="oxfordreference.com"&gt;Oxford Reference, [http://www.oxfordreference.com/view/10.1093/oi/authority.20110803102144812 "Alfred Tarski"], ''Oxford Reference''.&lt;/ref&gt; was a Polish-American&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.oxfordbibliographies.com/view/document/obo-9780195396577/obo-9780195396577-0186.xml |title=Alfred Tarski - Philosophy - Oxford Bibliographies |last=Gomez-Torrente |first=Mario |date=March 27, 2014 |website=[[Oxford University Press]] |accessdate=October 24, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[logic]]ian and [[mathematician]]&lt;ref&gt;Alfred Tarski, [https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/tarski/ "Alfred Tarski"], ''Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy''.&lt;/ref&gt; of [[Ashkenazi Jews|Polish-Jewish]] descent.&lt;ref name="Alfred Tarski"/&gt;&lt;ref name="oxfordreference.com"/&gt; Educated in Poland at the [[University of Warsaw]], and a member of the [[Lwów–Warsaw school|Lwów–Warsaw school of logic]] and the [[Warsaw school of mathematics]], he immigrated to the United States in 1939 where he became a naturalized citizen in 1945. Tarski taught and carried out research in mathematics at the [[University of California, Berkeley]], from 1942 until his death in 1983.&lt;ref name=FefA&gt;[[#FefA|Feferman A.]]&lt;/ref&gt;

A prolific author best known for his work on [[model theory]], [[metamathematics]], and [[algebraic logic]], he also contributed to [[abstract algebra]], [[topology]], [[geometry]], [[measure theory]], [[mathematical logic]], [[set theory]], and [[analytic philosophy]].

His biographers Anita and [[Solomon Feferman]] state that, "Along with his contemporary, [[Kurt Gödel]], he changed the face of logic in the twentieth century, especially through his work on the concept of [[truth]] and the theory of models."&lt;ref name=FFintro&gt;[[#F-F|Feferman &amp; Feferman]], p.1&lt;/ref&gt;

==Life==
Alfred Tarski was born '''Alfred Teitelbaum''' ([[Polish language|Polish]] spelling: "Tajtelbaum"), to parents who were [[Polish Jews]] in comfortable circumstances relative to other Jews in the overall region. He first manifested his mathematical abilities while in secondary school, at Warsaw's ''Szkoła Mazowiecka''.&lt;ref&gt;[[#F-F|Feferman &amp; Feferman]], pp.17-18&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, he entered the [[University of Warsaw]] in 1918 intending to study [[biology]].&lt;ref name="Feferman &amp; Feferman, p.26"&gt;[[#F-F|Feferman &amp; Feferman]], p.26&lt;/ref&gt;

After Poland regained independence in 1918, Warsaw University came under the leadership of [[Jan Łukasiewicz]], [[Stanisław Leśniewski]] and [[Wacław Sierpiński]] and quickly became a world-leading research institution in logic, foundational mathematics, and the philosophy of mathematics. Leśniewski recognized Tarski's potential as a mathematician and encouraged him to abandon biology.&lt;ref name="Feferman &amp; Feferman, p.26"/&gt;  Henceforth Tarski attended courses taught by Łukasiewicz, Sierpiński, [[Stefan Mazurkiewicz]] and [[Tadeusz Kotarbiński]], and became the only person ever to complete a doctorate under Leśniewski's supervision. Tarski and Leśniewski soon grew cool to each other. However, in later life, Tarski reserved his warmest praise for [[Tadeusz Kotarbiński|Kotarbiński]], which was reciprocated.

In 1923, Alfred Teitelbaum and his brother Wacław changed their surname to "Tarski".&lt;!--Unsourced: (Years later, Alfred met another Alfred Tarski in northern California.)--&gt; The Tarski brothers also converted to [[Roman Catholicism]], Poland's dominant religion. Alfred did so even though he was an avowed [[atheism|atheist]].&lt;ref&gt;[[#F-F|Feferman &amp; Feferman]], p.294&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Most of the Socialist Party members were also in favor of assimilation, and Tarski's political allegiance was socialist at the time. So, along with its being a practical move, becoming more Polish than Jewish was an ideological statement and was approved by many, though not all, of his colleagues. As to why Tarski, a professed atheist, converted, that just came with the territory and was part of the package: if you were going to be Polish then you had to say you were Catholic."

After becoming the youngest person ever to complete a doctorate at Warsaw University, Tarski taught logic at the Polish Pedagogical Institute, mathematics and logic at the University, and served as Łukasiewicz's assistant. Because these positions were poorly paid, Tarski also taught mathematics at a Warsaw secondary school;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.januszkorczak.ca/bulletins/Bulletin%20%235.pdf|title=The Newsletter of the Janusz Korczak Association of Canada|id=Number 5|date=September 2007|accessdate=8 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; before World War II, it was not uncommon for European intellectuals of research caliber to teach high school. Hence between 1923 and his departure for the United States in 1939, Tarski not only wrote several textbooks and many papers, a number of them ground-breaking, but also did so while supporting himself primarily by teaching high-school mathematics. In 1929 Tarski married fellow teacher Maria Witkowska, a Pole of Catholic background. She had worked as a courier for the army in the [[Polish–Soviet War]]. They had two children; a son Jan who became a physicist, and a daughter Ina who married the mathematician [[Andrzej Ehrenfeucht]].&lt;ref&gt;Feferman &amp; Feferman (2004), pp. 239–242.&lt;/ref&gt;

Tarski applied for a chair of philosophy at [[Lwów University]], but on [[Bertrand Russell]]'s recommendation it was awarded to [[Leon Chwistek]].&lt;ref&gt;[[#F-F|Feferman &amp; Feferman]], p. 67&lt;/ref&gt; In 1930, Tarski visited the [[University of Vienna]], lectured to [[Karl Menger]]'s colloquium, and met [[Kurt Gödel]]. Thanks to a fellowship, he was able to return to Vienna during the first half of 1935 to work with Menger's research group. From Vienna he traveled to Paris to present his ideas on truth at the first meeting of the [[Unity of Science]] movement, an outgrowth of the [[Vienna Circle]]. In 1937, Tarski applied for a chair at [[Poznań University]] but the chair was abolished.&lt;ref&gt;[[#F-F|Feferman &amp; Feferman]], pp. 102-103&lt;/ref&gt; Tarski's ties to the Unity of Science movement likely saved his life, because they resulted in his being invited to address the Unity of Science Congress held in September 1939 at [[Harvard University]]. Thus he left Poland in August 1939, on the last ship to sail from Poland for the United States before the German and Soviet [[invasion of Poland]] and the outbreak of [[World War II]]. Tarski left reluctantly, because Leśniewski had died a few months before, creating a vacancy which Tarski hoped to fill. Oblivious to the [[Nazi]] threat, he left his wife and children in Warsaw. He did not see them again until 1946. During the war, nearly all his Jewish extended family were murdered at the hands of the German occupying authorities.

Once in the United States, Tarski held a number of temporary teaching and research positions: Harvard University (1939), [[City College of New York]] (1940), and thanks to a [[Guggenheim Fellowship]], the [[Institute for Advanced Study]] in [[Princeton, New Jersey|Princeton]] (1942), where he again met Gödel. In 1942, Tarski joined the Mathematics Department at the [[University of California, Berkeley]], where he spent the rest of his career. Tarski became an American citizen in 1945.&lt;ref&gt;[[#F-F|Feferman &amp; Feferman]], Chap. 5, pp. 124-149&lt;/ref&gt; Although emeritus from 1968, he taught until 1973 and supervised Ph.D. candidates until his death.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://content.cdlib.org/xtf/view?docId=hb4d5nb20m&amp;doc.view=frames&amp;chunk.id=div00159&amp;toc.depth=1&amp;toc.id=|title=Alfred Tarski, Mathematics: Berkeley|author1=Robert Vaught|author2=John Addison|author3=Benson Mates|author4=Julia Robinson |year=1985|publisher=University of California (System) Academic Senate|accessdate=2008-12-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; At Berkeley, Tarski acquired a reputation as an awesome and demanding teacher, a fact noted by many observers:

&lt;blockquote&gt;His seminars at Berkeley quickly became famous in the world of mathematical logic. His students, many of whom became distinguished mathematicians, noted the awesome energy with which he would coax and cajole their best work out of them, always demanding the highest standards of clarity and precision.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www-groups.dcs.st-and.ac.uk/~history/Obits/Tarski.html Obituary in ''Times'', reproduced here]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Tarski was extroverted, quick-witted, strong-willed, energetic, and sharp-tongued. He preferred his research to be collaborative — sometimes working all night with a colleague — and was very fastidious about priority.&lt;ref&gt;Gregory Moore, "Alfred Tarski" in ''[[Dictionary of Scientific Biography]]''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;A charismatic leader and teacher, known for his brilliantly precise yet suspenseful expository style, Tarski had intimidatingly high standards for students, but at the same time he could be very encouraging, and particularly so to women — in contrast to the general trend. Some students were frightened away, but a circle of disciples remained, many of whom became world-renowned leaders in the field.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Fef|Feferman]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Tarski supervised twenty-four Ph.D. dissertations including (in chronological order) those of [[Andrzej Mostowski]], [[Bjarni Jónsson]], [[Julia Robinson]], [[Robert Vaught]], [[Solomon Feferman]], [[Richard Montague]], James Donald Monk, [[Haim Gaifman]], Donald Pigozzi and [[Roger Maddux]], as well as [[Chen Chung Chang]] and [[Jerome Keisler]], authors of ''Model Theory'' (1973),&lt;ref&gt;Chang, C.C., and Keisler, H.J., 1973. ''Model Theory''. North-Holland, Amsterdam.  American Elsevier, New York.&lt;/ref&gt; a classic text in the field.&lt;ref&gt;{{MathGenealogy|id=13347}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=studentlist&gt;[[#F-F|Feferman &amp; Feferman]], pp. 385-386&lt;/ref&gt; He also strongly influenced the dissertations of Alfred Lindenbaum, [[Dana Scott]], and Steven Givant. Five of Tarski's students were women, a remarkable fact given that men represented an overwhelming majority of graduate students at the time.&lt;ref name=studentlist/&gt;

Tarski lectured at [[University College, London]] (1950, 1966), the [[Institut Henri Poincaré]] in Paris (1955), the [[Miller Institute for Basic Research in Science]] in Berkeley (1958&amp;ndash;60), the [[University of California at Los Angeles]] (1967), and the [[Pontifical Catholic University of Chile]] (1974&amp;ndash;75). Among many distinctions garnered over the course of his career, Tarski was elected to the [[United States National Academy of Sciences]], the [[British Academy]] and the [[Royal Netherlands Academy of Arts and Sciences]] in 1958,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=http://www.dwc.knaw.nl/biografie/pmknaw/?pagetype=authorDetail&amp;aId=PE00003268 |title=Alfred Tarski (1902 - 1983) |publisher=Royal Netherlands Academy of Arts and Sciences |date= |accessdate=17 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; received [[honorary degree]]s from the Pontifical Catholic University of Chile in 1975, from [[Marseilles]]' [[Paul Cézanne University]] in 1977 and from the [[University of Calgary]], as well as the Berkeley Citation in 1981. Tarski presided over the [[Association for Symbolic Logic]], 1944&amp;ndash;46, and the International Union for the History and Philosophy of Science, 1956&amp;ndash;57. He was also an honorary editor of ''[[Algebra Universalis]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{MacTutor Biography|id=Tarski}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mathematician==
Tarski's mathematical interests were exceptionally broad. His collected papers run to about 2,500 pages, most of them on mathematics, not logic. For a concise survey of Tarski's mathematical and logical accomplishments by his former student Solomon Feferman, see "Interludes I&amp;ndash;VI" in Feferman and Feferman.&lt;ref&gt;[[#F-F|Feferman &amp; Feferman]], pp. 43-52, 69-75, 109-123, 189-195, 277-287, 334-342&lt;/ref&gt;

Tarski's first paper, published when he was 19 years old, was on [[set theory]], a subject to which he returned throughout his life. In 1924, he and [[Stefan Banach]] proved that, if one accepts the [[Axiom of Choice]], a [[Ball (mathematics)|ball]] can be cut into a finite number of pieces, and then reassembled into a ball of larger size, or alternatively it can be reassembled into two balls whose sizes each equal that of the original one. This result is now called the [[Banach–Tarski paradox]].

In ''A decision method for elementary algebra and geometry'', Tarski showed, by the method of [[quantifier elimination]], that the [[first-order theory]] of the [[real number]]s under addition and multiplication is [[Decidability (logic)|decidable]]. (While this result appeared only in 1948, it dates back to 1930 and was mentioned in Tarski (1931).) This is a very curious result, because [[Alonzo Church]] proved in 1936 that [[Peano arithmetic]] (the theory  of [[natural number]]s) is ''not'' decidable. Peano arithmetic is also incomplete by [[Gödel's incompleteness theorem]]. In his 1953 ''Undecidable theories'', Tarski et al. showed that many mathematical systems, including [[lattice theory]], abstract [[projective geometry]], and [[closure algebra]]s, are all undecidable. The theory of [[Abelian group]]s is decidable, but that of non-Abelian groups is not.

In the 1920s and 30s, Tarski often taught high school [[geometry]]. Using some ideas of [[Mario Pieri]], in 1926 Tarski devised an original [[axiomatization]] for plane [[Euclidean geometry]], one considerably more concise than [[Hilbert's axioms|Hilbert's]]. [[Tarski's axioms]] form a first-order theory devoid of set theory, whose individuals are [[Point (geometry)|points]], and having only two primitive [[finitary relation|relations]]. In 1930, he proved this theory decidable because it can be mapped into another theory he had already proved decidable, namely his first-order theory of the real numbers.

In 1929 he showed that much of Euclidean [[solid geometry]] could be recast as a first-order theory whose individuals are ''spheres'' (a [[primitive notion]]), a single primitive binary relation "is contained in", and two axioms that, among other things, imply that containment [[partial order|partially orders]] the spheres. Relaxing the requirement that all individuals be spheres yields a formalization of [[mereology]] far easier to exposit than [[Lesniewski]]'s variant. Near the end of his life, Tarski wrote a very long letter, published as Tarski and Givant (1999), summarizing his work on geometry.

''Cardinal Algebras'' studied algebras whose models include the arithmetic of [[cardinal number]]s. ''Ordinal Algebras'' sets out an algebra for the additive theory of [[order type]]s. Cardinal, but not ordinal, addition commutes.

In 1941, Tarski published an important paper on [[binary relation]]s, which began the work on [[relation algebra]] and its [[metamathematics]] that occupied Tarski and his students for much of the balance of his life. While that exploration (and the closely related work of [[Roger Lyndon]]) uncovered some important limitations of relation algebra, Tarski also showed (Tarski and Givant 1987) that relation algebra can express most [[axiomatic set theory]] and [[Peano arithmetic]]. For an introduction to [[relation algebra]], see Maddux (2006). In the late 1940s, Tarski and his students devised [[cylindric algebra]]s, which are to [[first-order logic]] what the [[two-element Boolean algebra]] is to classical [[sentential logic]]. This work culminated in the two monographs by Tarski, Henkin, and Monk (1971, 1985).

==Logician==
Tarski's student, Vaught, has ranked Tarski as one of the four greatest logicians of all time &amp;mdash; along with Aristotle, [[Gottlob Frege]], and Kurt Gödel.&lt;ref name=FFintro/&gt;&lt;ref name="Vaught"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Vaught|first=Robert L.|date=Dec 1986|title=Alfred Tarski's Work in Model Theory|journal=[[Journal of Symbolic Logic]]|publisher=ASL|volume=51|issue=4|pages=869–882|doi=10.2307/2273900|jstor=2273900}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Restall"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://consequently.org/writing/logicians/|title=Great Moments in Logic |last=Restall|first=Greg|date=2002–2006|accessdate=2009-01-03| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20081206052240/http://consequently.org/writing/logicians/| archivedate= 6 December 2008 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;!-- Of these four, he was by far the most prolific author. MORE THAN ARISTOTLE???  PROVIDE Reference! --&gt; However, Tarski often expressed great admiration for [[Logic of relatives|Charles Sanders Peirce]], particularly for his pioneering work in the [[Finitary relation|logic of relations]].

Tarski produced axioms for ''logical consequence'', and worked on [[deductive system]]s, the algebra of logic, and the theory of definability. His semantic methods, which culminated in the model theory he and a number of his Berkeley students developed in the 1950s and 60s, radically transformed Hilbert's proof-theoretic metamathematics.

&lt;blockquote&gt;In [Tarski's] view, metamathematics became similar to any mathematical discipline. Not only can its concepts and results be mathematized, but they actually can be integrated into mathematics. ... Tarski destroyed the borderline between metamathematics and mathematics. He objected to restricting the role of metamathematics to the foundations of mathematics.&lt;ref name="Sinaceur"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Sinaceur|first=Hourya|title=Alfred Tarski: Semantic Shift, Heuristic Shift in Metamathematics|journal=Synthese|publisher=Springer Verlag|volume=126|issue=1–2|pages=49–65|issn=0039-7857|doi=10.1023/A:1005268531418|year=2001|url=https://halshs.archives-ouvertes.fr/halshs-01119489}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Tarski's 1936 article "On the concept of logical consequence" argued that the conclusion of an argument will follow logically from its premises if and only if every model of the premises is a model of the conclusion. In 1937, he published a paper presenting clearly his views on the nature and purpose of the deductive method, and the role of logic in scientific studies. His high school and undergraduate teaching on logic and axiomatics culminated in a classic short text, published first in Polish, then in German translation, and finally in a 1941 English translation as ''Introduction to Logic and to the Methodology of Deductive Sciences''.

Tarski's 1969 "Truth and proof" considered both [[Gödel's incompleteness theorems]] and [[Tarski's undefinability theorem]], and mulled over their consequences for the axiomatic method in mathematics.

==Truth in formalized languages==
{{main|Semantic theory of truth}}
In 1933, Tarski published a very long paper in Polish, titled "Pojęcie prawdy w językach nauk dedukcyjnych",&lt;ref&gt;Alfred Tarski, "POJĘCIE PRAWDY W JĘZYKACH NAUK DEDUKCYJNYCH", Towarszystwo Naukowe Warszawskie, Warszawa, 1933. [http://www.archiwum.wfis.uw.edu.pl/bibfis/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=129:a-tarski-pojcie-prawdy-w-jzykach-nauk-dedukcyjnych&amp;catid=56:marginalia&amp;Itemid=106 (Text in Polish in the Digital Library WFISUW-IFISPAN-PTF)].&lt;/ref&gt; setting out a mathematical definition of truth for formal languages. The 1935 German translation was titled "Der Wahrheitsbegriff in den formalisierten Sprachen", "The concept of truth in formalized languages", sometimes shortened to "Wahrheitsbegriff". An English translation appeared in the 1956 first edition of the volume ''Logic, Semantics, Metamathematics''. This collection of papers from 1923 to 1938 is an event in 20th-century [[analytic philosophy]], a contribution to [[Mathematical logic|symbolic logic]], [[semantics]], and the [[philosophy of language]]. For a brief discussion of its content, see [[Convention T]] (and also [[T-schema]]).

Some recent philosophical debate examines the extent to which Tarski's theory of truth for formalized languages can be seen as a [[correspondence theory of truth]]. The debate centers on how to read Tarski's condition of material adequacy for a truth definition. That condition requires that the truth theory have the following as theorems for all sentences p of the language for which truth is being defined:

: "p" is true [[if and only if]] p.

(where p is the proposition expressed by "p")

The debate amounts to whether to read sentences of this form, such as

&lt;blockquote&gt;"Snow is white" is true if and only if snow is white&lt;/blockquote&gt;

as expressing merely a [[deflationary theory of truth]] or as embodying [[truth]] as a more substantial property (see Kirkham 1992). It is important to realize that Tarski's theory of truth is for formalized languages, so  examples in natural language are not illustrations of the use of Tarski's theory of truth.

==Logical consequence==
In 1936, Tarski published Polish and German versions of a lecture he had given the preceding year at the International Congress of Scientific Philosophy in Paris. &lt;!-- (First appearance in English?) --&gt; A new English translation of this paper, Tarski (2002), highlights the many differences between the German and Polish versions of the paper, and corrects a number of mistranslations in Tarski (1983).

This publication set out the modern [[model theory|model-theoretic]] definition of (semantic) logical consequence, or at least the basis for it. Whether Tarski's notion was entirely the modern one turns on whether he intended to admit models with varying domains (and in particular, models with domains of different [[cardinal number|cardinalities]]). This question is a matter of some debate in the current philosophical literature. [[John Etchemendy]] stimulated much of the recent discussion about Tarski's treatment of varying domains.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Etchemendy|first=John|title=The Concept of Logical Consequence|publisher=Stanford CA: CSLI Publications|year=1999|isbn=1-57586-194-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Tarski ends by pointing out that his definition of logical consequence depends upon a division of terms into the logical and the extra-logical and he expresses some skepticism that any such objective division will be forthcoming. "What are Logical Notions?" can thus be viewed as continuing "On the Concept of Logical Consequence".

==Work on logical notions==
Another theory of Tarski's attracting attention in the recent philosophical literature is that outlined in his "What are Logical Notions?" (Tarski 1986). This is the published version of a talk that he gave originally in 1966 in London and later in 1973 in [[Buffalo, New York|Buffalo]]; it was edited without his direct involvement by [[John Corcoran (logician)|John Corcoran]]. It became the most cited paper in the journal ''History and Philosophy of Logic''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tandfonline.com/action/showMostCitedArticles?journalCode=thpl20#.UkH58D_-kQs]&lt;/ref&gt;

In the talk, Tarski proposed a demarcation of the logical operations (which he calls "notions") from the non-logical. The suggested criteria were derived from the [[Erlangen programme]] of the German 19th century Mathematician, [[Felix Klein]]. Mautner, in 1946, and possibly an article by the Portuguese mathematician Sebastiao e Silva, anticipated Tarski in applying the Erlangen Program to logic.

That program classified the various types of geometry ([[Euclidean geometry]], [[affine geometry]], [[topology]], etc.) by the type of one-one transformation of space onto itself that left the objects of that geometrical theory invariant. (A one-to-one transformation is a functional map of the space onto itself so that every point of the space is associated with or mapped to one other point of the space. So, "rotate 30 degrees" and  "magnify by a factor of 2" are intuitive descriptions of simple uniform one-one transformations.) Continuous transformations give rise to the objects of topology, similarity transformations to those of Euclidean geometry, and so on.

As the range of permissible transformations becomes broader, the range of objects one is able to distinguish as preserved by the application of the transformations becomes narrower. Similarity transformations are fairly narrow (they preserve the relative distance between points) and thus allow us to distinguish relatively many things (e.g., equilateral triangles from non-equilateral triangles). Continuous transformations (which can intuitively be thought of as transformations which allow non-uniform stretching, compression, bending, and twisting, but no ripping or glueing) allow us to distinguish a [[polygon]] from an [[annulus (mathematics)|annulus]] (ring with a hole in the centre), but do not allow us to distinguish two polygons from each other.

Tarski's proposal was to demarcate the logical notions by considering all possible one-to-one transformations ([[automorphism]]s) of a domain onto itself. By domain is meant the [[universe of discourse]] of a model for the semantic theory of a logic. If one identifies the [[truth value]] True with the domain set and the truth-value False with the empty set, then the following operations are counted as logical under the proposal:

# ''[[Truth-function]]s'': All truth-functions are admitted by the proposal. This includes, but is not limited to, all ''n''-ary truth-functions for finite ''n''. (It also admits of truth-functions with any infinite number of places.)
# ''Individuals'': No individuals, provided the domain has at least two members.
# ''Predicates'':
#* the one-place total and null predicates, the former having all members of the domain in its extension and the latter having no members of the domain in its extension
#* two-place total and null predicates, the former having the set of all ordered pairs of domain members as its extension and the latter with the empty set as extension
#* the two-place identity predicate, with the set of all order-pairs &lt;''a'',''a''&gt; in its extension, where ''a'' is a member of the domain
#* the two-place diversity predicate, with the set of all order pairs &lt;''a'',''b''&gt; where ''a'' and ''b'' are distinct members of the domain
#* ''n''-ary predicates in general: all predicates definable from the identity predicate together with [[Logical conjunction|conjunction]], [[disjunction]] and [[negation]] (up to any ordinality, finite or infinite)
# ''[[Quantifier (logic)|Quantifiers]]'': Tarski explicitly discusses only monadic quantifiers and points out that all such numerical quantifiers are admitted under his proposal. These include the standard universal and existential quantifiers as well as numerical quantifiers such as "Exactly four", "Finitely many", "Uncountably many", and "Between four and 9 million", for example. While Tarski does not enter into the issue, it is also clear that polyadic quantifiers are admitted under the proposal. These are quantifiers like, given two predicates ''Fx'' and ''Gy'', "More(''x, y'')", which says "More things have ''F'' than have ''G''."
# ''Set-Theoretic relations'': Relations such as [[inclusion (set theory)|inclusion]], [[Intersection (set theory)|intersection]] and [[Union (set theory)|union]] applied to [[subset]]s of the domain are logical in the present sense.
# ''Set membership'': Tarski ended his lecture with a discussion of whether the set membership relation counted as logical in his sense. (Given the reduction of (most of) mathematics to set theory, this was, in effect, the question of whether most or all of mathematics is a part of logic.) He pointed out that set membership is logical if set theory is developed along the lines of [[type theory]], but is extralogical if set theory is set out axiomatically, as in the canonical [[Zermelo–Fraenkel set theory]].
# ''Logical notions of higher order'': While Tarski confined his discussion to operations of first-order logic, there is nothing about his proposal that necessarily restricts it to first-order logic. (Tarski likely restricted his attention to first-order notions as the talk was given to a non-technical audience.) So, higher-order quantifiers and predicates are admitted as well.

In some ways the present proposal is the obverse of that of Lindenbaum and Tarski (1936), who proved that all the logical operations of Russell and [[Alfred North Whitehead|Whitehead]]'s ''[[Principia Mathematica]]'' are invariant under one-to-one transformations of the domain onto itself. The present proposal is also employed in Tarski and Givant (1987).

Solomon Feferman and Vann McGee further discussed Tarski's proposal in work published after his death. Feferman (1999) raises problems for the proposal and suggests a cure: replacing Tarski's preservation by automorphisms with preservation by arbitrary [[homomorphism]]s. In essence, this suggestion circumvents the difficulty Tarski's proposal has in dealing with sameness of logical operation across distinct domains of a given cardinality and across domains of distinct cardinalities. Feferman's proposal results in a radical restriction of logical terms as compared to Tarski's original proposal. In particular, it ends up counting as logical only those operators of standard first-order logic without identity.

McGee (1996) provides a precise account of what operations are logical in the sense of Tarski's proposal in terms of expressibility in a language that extends first-order logic by allowing arbitrarily long conjunctions and disjunctions, and quantification over arbitrarily many variables. "Arbitrarily" includes a countable infinity.

'''Anecdotal''' '''evidence''' is [[evidence]] from [[anecdote]]s, i.e., evidence collected in a casual or informal manner and relying heavily or entirely on personal testimony. When compared to other types of evidence, anecdotal evidence is generally regarded as limited in value due to a number of potential weaknesses, but may be considered within the scope of [[scientific method]] as some anecdotal evidence can be both empirical and verifiable, e.g. in the use of [[case studies]] in medicine. Other anecdotal evidence, however, does not qualify as scientific evidence, because its nature prevents it from being investigated by the scientific method.

Where only one or a few anecdotes are presented, there is a larger chance that they may be unreliable due to [[Cherry picking (fallacy)|cherry-picked]] or otherwise [[Sampling (statistics)|non-representative]] samples of typical cases.&lt;ref name=weiten&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=sILajOhJpOsC&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;pg=PT121#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false p. 75 of Psychology: Themes and Variations] by Wayne Weiten&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=eNsVUGTMcDoC p. 25 in Research in Psychology: Methods and Design], by C. James Goodwin.&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, psychologists have found that due to [[cognitive bias]] people are more likely to remember notable or unusual examples rather than typical examples.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Gibson |first=Rhonda |last2=Zillman |first2=Dolf |year=1994 |title=Exaggerated Versus Representative Exemplification in News Reports: Perception of Issues and Personal Consequences |journal=Communication Research |volume=21 |issue=5 |pages=603–624 |doi=10.1177/009365094021005003 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, even when accurate, anecdotal evidence is not necessarily representative of a typical experience. Accurate determination of whether an anecdote is typical requires [[statistical]] evidence.&lt;ref&gt;Schwarz J, Barrett S. ''Some Notes on the Nature of Evidence''.[http://www.quackwatch.com/01QuackeryRelatedTopics/science.html Link.] Retrieved 26 August 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; Misuse of anecdotal evidence is an [[informal fallacy]] and is sometimes referred to as the "person who" fallacy ("I know a person who..."; "I know of a case where..." etc.) which places undue weight on experiences of close peers which may not be typical. Compare with [[hasty generalization]].

The term is sometimes used in a legal context to describe certain kinds of [[testimony]] which are uncorroborated by objective, independent evidence such as notarized documentation, photographs, audio-visual recordings, etc.

When used in [[advertising]] or promotion of a product, service, or idea, anecdotal reports are often called a [[testimonial]], which are highly regulated&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.ftc.gov/sites/default/files/attachments/press-releases/ftc-publishes-final-guides-governing-endorsements-testimonials/091005revisedendorsementguides.pdf Guides Concerning the Use of Endorsements and Testimonials in Advertising]&lt;/ref&gt; or banned in some{{which|date=December 2015}} jurisdictions.

==Introduction==
In all forms of anecdotal evidence, its reliability by objective independent assessment may be in doubt. This is a consequence of the informal way the information is gathered, documented, presented, or any combination of the three. The term is often used to describe evidence for which there is an absence of documentation, leaving verification dependent on the credibility of the party presenting the evidence.

==Scientific context==
In science, definitions of anecdotal evidence include:

*"casual observations or indications rather than rigorous or scientific analysis"&lt;ref name="yourdictionary"&gt;[http://www.yourdictionary.com/ahd/a/a0294100.html YourDictionary.com] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070312062259/http://www.yourdictionary.com/ahd/a/a0294100.html |date=March 12, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
*"information passed along by word-of-mouth but not documented scientifically"{{Citation needed|date=May 2013}}

Anecdotal evidence can have varying degrees of formality. For instance, in medicine, published anecdotal evidence by a trained observer (a doctor) is called a [[case report]], and is subjected to formal [[peer review]].&lt;ref name="Jenicek"&gt;{{cite book |last=Jenicek |first=M. |title=Clinical Case Reporting in Evidence-Based Medicine |location=Oxford |publisher=Butterworth–Heinemann |year=1999 |pages=117 |isbn=0-7506-4592-X }}&lt;/ref&gt; Although such evidence is not seen as conclusive, it is sometimes regarded as an invitation to more rigorous scientific study of the phenomenon in question.&lt;ref name="Vandenbroucke"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Vandenbroucke |first=J. P. |year=2001 |title=In Defense of Case Reports and Case Series |journal=Annals of Internal Medicine |volume=134 |issue=4 |pages=330–334 |url=http://www.annals.org/content/134/4/330.short |pmid=11182844 |doi=10.7326/0003-4819-134-4-200102200-00017}}&lt;/ref&gt; For instance, one study found that 35 of 47 anecdotal reports of drug side-effects were later sustained as "clearly correct."&lt;ref name="Venning"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Venning |first=G. R. |title=Validity of anecdotal reports of suspected adverse drug reactions: the problem of false alarms |journal=Br Med J (Clin Res Ed) |year=1982 |volume=284 |issue=6311 |pages=249–52 |pmid=0006799125 |doi=10.1136/bmj.284.6311.249 |pmc=1495801}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Anecdotal evidence is considered the least certain type of scientific information.&lt;ref name="isbn0-12-588560-1"&gt;{{cite book |author=Riffenburgh, R. H. |title=Statistics in Medicine |publisher=Academic Press |location=Boston |year=1999 |pages=196 |isbn=0-12-588560-1 |oclc= |doi= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Researchers may use anecdotal evidence for suggesting new [[hypothesis|hypotheses]], but never as validating evidence.

==Faulty logic==

Anecdotal evidence is often unscientific or [[pseudoscience|pseudoscientific]] because various forms of [[cognitive bias]] may affect the collection or presentation of evidence. For instance, someone who claims to have had an encounter with a supernatural being or alien may present a very vivid story, but this is not [[falsifiability|falsifiable]]. This phenomenon can also happen to large groups of people through [[subjective validation]].

Anecdotal evidence is also frequently misinterpreted via the [[availability heuristic]], which leads to an overestimation of prevalence. Where a cause can be easily linked to an effect, people overestimate the likelihood of the cause having that effect (availability). In particular, vivid, emotionally charged anecdotes seem more plausible, and are given greater weight. A related issue is that it is usually impossible to assess for every piece of anecdotal evidence, the rate of people not reporting that anecdotal evidence in the population.

A common way anecdotal evidence becomes unscientific is through [[fallacy|fallacious]] reasoning such as the ''[[Post hoc ergo propter hoc]]'' fallacy, the human tendency to assume that if one event happens after another, then the first must be the cause of the second. Another fallacy involves [[inductive reasoning]]. For instance, if an anecdote illustrates a desired conclusion rather than a logical conclusion, it is considered a [[faulty generalization|faulty]] or [[hasty generalization]].&lt;ref name="Thompson"&gt;Thompson B. [http://www.cuyamaca.edu/bruce.thompson/Fallacies/anecdotal.asp Fallacies.] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060420154531/http://www.cuyamaca.edu/bruce.thompson/Fallacies/anecdotal.asp |date=April 20, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, here is anecdotal evidence presented as proof of a desired conclusion:

&lt;blockquote&gt;There's abundant proof that drinking water cures cancer. Just last week I read about a girl who was dying of cancer. After drinking water she was cured.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Anecdotes like this do not prove anything.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.infidels.org/news/atheism/logic.html |title=The Atheism Web: Logic &amp; Fallacies |website=infidels.org |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20030602105657/http://www.infidels.org/news/atheism/logic.html |archivedate=2003-06-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; In any case where some factor affects the probability of an outcome, rather than uniquely determining it, selected individual cases prove nothing; e.g. "my grandfather smoked 40 a day until he died at 90" and "my sister never went near anyone who smoked but died of lung cancer". Anecdotes often refer to the exception, rather than the rule: "Anecdotes are useless precisely because they may point to idiosyncratic responses."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=Scott H. |last=Sicherer |title=Food allergy: When and how to perform oral food challenges |journal=Pediatric Allergy &amp; Immunology |year=1999 |volume=10 |issue=4 |pages=226–234 |doi=10.1034/j.1399-3038.1999.00040.x }}&lt;/ref&gt;

More generally, a statistical correlation between things does not in itself prove that one causes the other (a [[causal]] link). A study found that television viewing was strongly correlated with sugar consumption, but this does not prove that viewing causes sugar intake (or vice versa).

In medicine anecdotal evidence is also subject to [[placebo effect]]s:&lt;ref name="Lee"&gt;Lee D (2005). [http://www.medicinenet.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=55090&amp;page=2 Evaluating Medications and Supplement Products.] via MedicineNet&lt;/ref&gt; it is well-established that a patient's (or doctor's) expectation can genuinely change the outcome of treatment. Only [[double-blind]] [[random sample|randomized]] [[placebo]]-controlled [[clinical trial]]s can confirm a [[hypothesis]] about the effectiveness of a treatment independently of expectations.

By contrast, in science and logic, the "relative strength of an explanation" is based upon its ability to be tested or repeated, proven to be due to the stated cause, and verifiable under neutral conditions in a manner that other researchers will agree has been performed competently, and can check for themselves.

==Law==
{{refimprove section|date=March 2016}}
[[Witness]] [[testimony]] is a common form of [[evidence (law)|evidence]] in law, and law has mechanisms to test witness evidence for reliability or credibility. Legal processes for the taking and assessment of evidence are formalized. Some witness testimony may be described as anecdotal evidence, such as individual stories of [[harassment]] as part of a [[class action lawsuit]]. However, witness testimony can be tested and assessed for reliability. Examples of approaches to testing and assessment include the use of questioning to identify possible gaps or inconsistencies, evidence of corroborating witnesses, documents, video and forensic evidence. Where a court lacks suitable means to test and assess testimony of a particular witness, such as the absence of forms of corroboration or substantiation, it may afford that testimony limited or no "weight" when making a decision on the facts.

==Scientific evidence as legal evidence==

In certain situations, scientific evidence presented in court must also meet the legal requirements for evidence. For instance, in the United States, expert testimony of witnesses must meet the [[Daubert standard]]. This ruling holds that before evidence is presented to witnesses by experts, the methodology must be "generally accepted" among scientists. In some situations, anecdotal evidence may meet this threshold (such as certain case reports which corroborate or refute other evidence).

Altman and Bland argue that the case report or statistical outlier cannot be dismissed as having no weight: "With rare and uncommonly occurring diseases, a nonsignificant finding in a randomized trial does not necessarily mean that there is no causal association between the agent in question and the disease."&lt;ref name="Altman"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Altman |first=D. G. |last2=Bland |first2=M. |title=Absence of evidence is not evidence of absence |journal=British Medical Journal |year=1995 |volume=311 |issue=7003 |pages=485 |doi=10.1136/bmj.311.7003.485 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''The Biocomplexity Institute of Virginia Tech''' (formerly the '''Virginia Bioinformatics Institute''') is a research organization specializing in [[bioinformatics]], [[computational biology]], and [[systems biology]]. The Institute has more than 250 personnel, including over 50 tenured and research faculty.  Research at the Institute involves collaboration in diverse disciplines such as mathematics, computer science, biology, plant pathology, biochemistry, systems biology, statistics, economics, synthetic biology and medicine. The institute develops -omic and bioinformatic tools and databases that can be applied to the study of human, animal and plant diseases as well as the discovery of new vaccine, drug and diagnostic targets.

The Institute's   programs are supported by a variety of government and private agencies including the [[National Institutes of Health]], [[National Science Foundation]], [[U.S. Department of Defense]], [[U.S. Department of Agriculture]], and [[U.S. Department of Energy]].  Since inception, the Biocomplexity Institute has received over $179 million in extramural support. It has a research portfolio totaling $68 million in grants and contracts. The Institute's executive director is Chris Barrett.

== History ==
The Institute opened in July 2000 in space in the [[Virginia Tech Corporate Research Center]]; it was hosted briefly in Building XI, then Building X, until it moved to Building XV in 2002, which was designed to host the institute. In January 2005, it moved into a new building on the main Virginia Tech's campus, called "Bioinformatics Facility Phase I and II", but retained its existing space in the CRC. In 2011, the Institute moved its National Capital Region office into the Virginia Tech building in [[Arlington, Virginia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vbi.vt.edu/about |accessdate=October 31, 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151024182741/http://www.vbi.vt.edu/about/ |archivedate=October 24, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2015, the Virginia Bioinformatics Institute (VBI) was quietly renamed and rebranded as the "Biocomplexity Institute".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://vtnews.vt.edu/articles/2015/12/120115-bi-biocomplexity.html|accessdate=May 3, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In November 2016, the home of the institute on Virginia Tech's main campus was dedicated as Steger Hall, after former Virginia Tech President Charles Steger.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.vt.edu/about/buildings/steger.html|accessdate=May 3, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Chemical Probes Portal''' is an open, online resource whose purpose is to identify and make available high quality [[chemical probe]]s for use in [[biological research]] and [[drug discovery]].  While chemical probes can be valuable tools to elucidate [[signal transduction]] pathways and to validate new [[drug target]]s, many of the probes that are in use are not selective and therefore can give very misleading results.&lt;ref name="Promise"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Arrowsmith CH, Audia JE, Austin C, Baell J, Bennett J, Blagg J, Bountra C, Brennan PE, Brown PJ, Bunnage ME, Buser-Doepner C, Campbell RM, Carter AJ, Cohen P, Copeland RA, Cravatt B, Dahlin JL, Dhanak D, Edwards AM, Frederiksen M, Frye SV, Gray N, Grimshaw CE, Hepworth D, Howe T, Huber KV, Jin J, Knapp S, Kotz JD, Kruger RG, Lowe D, Mader MM, Marsden B, Mueller-Fahrnow A, Müller S, O'Hagan RC, Overington JP, Owen DR, Rosenberg SH, Roth B, Roth B, Ross R, Schapira M, Schreiber SL, Shoichet B, Sundström M, Superti-Furga G, Taunton J, Toledo-Sherman L, Walpole C, Walters MA, Willson TM, Workman P, Young RN, Zuercher WJ | display-authors = 6 | title = The promise and peril of chemical probes | journal = Nature Chemical Biology | volume = 11 | issue = 8 | pages = 536–41 | date = August 2015 | pmid = 26196764 | doi = 10.1038/nchembio.1867 | pmc=4706458}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Portal recommends chemical probes based on ratings provided by its Scientific Advisory Board (SAB), a group of experts in the fields of [[chemical biology]], [[medicinal chemistry]], and [[pharmacology]], who (1) determine which are the best chemical probes available and (2) establish guidelines for using them.

==History==
After years of publishing best practice guidelines for the selection and use of chemical probes,&lt;ref name="Frye"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Frye SV | title = The art of the chemical probe | journal = Nature Chemical Biology | volume = 6 | issue = 3 | pages = 159–161 | date = March 2010 | pmid = 20154659 | doi = 10.1038/nchembio.296 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="fitness factors"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Workman P, Collins I | title = Probing the probes: fitness factors for small molecule tools | journal = Chemistry &amp; Biology | volume = 17 | issue = 6 | pages = 561–77 | date = June 2010 | pmid = 20609406 | doi = 10.1016/j.chembiol.2010.05.013 | pmc=2905514}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Bunnage"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Bunnage ME, Chekler EL, Jones LH | title = Target validation using chemical probes | journal = Nature Chemical Biology | volume = 9 | issue = 4 | pages = 195–9 | date = April 2013 | pmid = 23508172 | doi = 10.1038/nchembio.1197 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Kleiman"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Kleiman RJ, Ehlers MD | title = Data gaps limit the translational potential of preclinical research | journal = Science Translational Medicine | volume = 8 | issue = 320 | pages = 320ps1 | date = January 2016 | pmid = 26738793 | doi = 10.1126/scitranslmed.aac9888 }}&lt;/ref&gt; many in the field agreed that publications were insufficient to disseminate this type of information. In July 2015, these experts, led by the [[Structural Genomics Consortium]] (SGC), collaborated to publish an overview of the misuse of chemical probes and the impact that misuse has on the reliability of research.&lt;ref name="pmid26196764"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Arrowsmith CH, Audia JE, Austin C, Baell J, Bennett J, Blagg J, Bountra C, Brennan PE, Brown PJ, Bunnage ME, Buser-Doepner C, Campbell RM, Carter AJ, Cohen P, Copeland RA, Cravatt B, Dahlin JL, Dhanak D, Edwards AM, Frederiksen M, Frye SV, Gray N, Grimshaw CE, Hepworth D, Howe T, Huber KV, Jin J, Knapp S, Kotz JD, Kruger RG, Lowe D, Mader MM, Marsden B, Mueller-Fahrnow A, Müller S, O'Hagan RC, Overington JP, Owen DR, Rosenberg SH, Roth B, Roth B, Ross R, Schapira M, Schreiber SL, Shoichet B, Sundström M, Superti-Furga G, Taunton J, Toledo-Sherman L, Walpole C, Walters MA, Willson TM, Workman P, Young RN, Zuercher WJ | display-authors = 6 | title = The promise and peril of chemical probes | journal = Nature Chemical Biology | volume = 11 | issue = 8 | pages = 536–41 | year = 2015 | pmid = 26196764 | pmc = 4706458 | doi = 10.1038/nchembio.1867 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A prototype website was launched by the SGC in conjunction with the publication.

This publication and the portal were launched at the same time the biomedical research community was becoming aware of problems in the reproducibility of much of the scientific literature. According to an economic impact study, $28 billion per year is spent on irreproducible biomedical research in the US alone. The most common reasons that studies prove irreproducible include problems with the selection of reagents and reference materials (36%), study design (28%), data analysis and reporting (25%), and laboratory protocols (11%).&lt;ref name="Freedman"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Freedman LP, Cockburn IM, Simcoe TS | title = The Economics of Reproducibility in Preclinical Research | journal = PLoS Biology | volume = 13 | issue = 6 | pages = e1002165 | date = June 2015 | pmid = 26057340 | doi = 10.1371/journal.pbio | pmc=4461318}}&lt;/ref&gt; Errors in the selection and application of chemical probes can contribute to waste in each of these categories.

In 2016, the SGC recruited staff to take over the portal, establish it as an independent organization, and build it into a reputable source for information about chemical probes. This new organization was supported with funds provided by the [[Wellcome Trust]] and the SGC. By the end of the first quarter, the portal’s new leadership incorporated the organization in North Carolina, US, established a Board of Directors and developed a plan to grow the portal through a community-driven, expert-curation process. The portal was re-launched on June 30, 2016 with this operations plan integrated into the site, more data about the existing probes (~100) in the portal, recommendations for the use of those probes.

== Board of directors ==

In June 2016, the Portal announced its founding Board of Directors&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.chemicalprobes.org/news/chemical-probes-portal-announces-its-board-directors|title=The Chemical Probes Portal Announces its Board of Directors - Chemical Probes|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; including Mark Bunnage (Vertex), Aled Edwards (SGC), Yung Lie (Damon Runyon Cancer Research Foundation), Herbert Waldmann (Max Planck Institute of Molecular Physiology), Tim Willson (SGC UNC), and Paul Workman (ICR).

== Scientific advisory board ==

The SAB,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.chemicalprobes.org/scientific-advisory-board|title=Scientific Advisory Board - Chemical Probes|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; an international collection of experts from the fields of medicinal chemistry, pharmacology, and chemical biology, was created to provide the Portal with expert advice. The SAB considers submitted chemical probes and makes recommendations for their use. In addition to considering chemical probes, SAB members also provide strategic and scientific advice to portal staff to help ensure the portal stays in tune with the scientific community and its needs. The Portal issued an open call for new SAB members to join the effort in May 2016, which will remain open until the SAB reaches its target membership.

== Procedures ==

The Portal opted for an expert peer-review process&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.chemicalprobes.org/news/earning-portal-endorsement|title=Earning Portal Endorsement - Chemical Probes|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; to vet and rate chemical probes. Key to this process is the Portal’s SAB, who represent a global community and multiple professional environments (''e.g.'', pharma, biotech, clinical centers or academia). These experts bring diverse experiences and expertise to the Portal to help it provide balanced advice to scientists who want to use chemical probes in their experiments without becoming chemical probe experts themselves.

The Portal’s review process involves three main steps: 1) probe submission, 2) triage, 3) review and publication. In the first step, scientists who have generated and published chemical probes can submit their probes for consideration. Initially, the portal can only accept submissions for probes that have been published.

Portal staff consider completed probe submissions to determine whether they are eligible for review. Submissions must meet three criteria to merit consideration by the SAB: 1) the probe is published, 2) it has been deposited into a public database such as [[PubChem]] (the Portal can now deposit submitted probes to PubChem on behalf of its users), and 3) there are data supporting its validation in a cellular and/or ''in vivo'' model system. Probes that do not meet these criteria are not sent to the SAB for review but are retained in the database. Probes that meet all three criteria are reviewed.

SAB members review each probe submission, including the publication reporting the probe, and rate the probe for its use in cellular and/or ''in vivo'' model systems (''e.g.'', mice). Probes are evaluated for use in these two types of systems independently, meaning that it is not necessary for a probe to be validated for use in model organisms for it to be considered and endorsed by the portal. The portal has not strictly defined criteria that translate into Portal endorsement. Rather, the Portal relies on its experts, their experience with and knowledge of specific protein targets to assess the quality of a probe. SAB members can comment on each probe, providing guidance to users to ensure they understand the strengths and weaknesses of a probe before they use it.

Probes are published on the Portal along with a highlight of the probe’s validation data, and it takes a few weeks for the SAB ratings (denoted with 0 to 4 stars) to emerge. Probe pages also contain SAB comments and links to related databases or sources (''e.g.'', journals) where additional information can be found. Probes must receive an average of 3 stars to earn an endorsement from the Portal.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2621">'''Christian comedy''' is a subgenre of [[comedy]] where the material presented is aimed towards a Christian audience. The performances are typically held on church grounds or at off-site, church-sponsored venues.

The material often contains Christian references, although this is not a requirement. Recently, notable performers like [[Victoria Jackson]], [[Tim Conway]], [[Sinbad (entertainer)|Sinbad]] and [[Patricia Heaton]] have appeared on a DVD series for the Christian market entitled, "Thou Shalt Laugh"&lt;ref&gt;[http://thoushaltlaugh.com/ Thou Shalt Laugh] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071223151828/http://www.thoushaltlaugh.com/ |date=2007-12-23 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Christian comedy is increasingly being used as an [[outreach]], with the idea that a comedy show is a great way to bring people into church who may have never thought about coming.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.larryweaver.com/entertainment/christian-comedians.asp Christian Comedians]&lt;/ref&gt;

Christian comedy is also used as a method to renew and refresh the spirit of church members, based on the Bible passage that says laughter does a heart good, like medicine.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.christiancomedyacts.com Christian Comedy Acts]&lt;/ref&gt;

{{redirect|Cognitive}}
'''Cognition''' is "the mental action or process of acquiring knowledge and understanding through thought, experience, and the senses".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = cognition - definition of cognition in English from the Oxford dictionary|url = http://www.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/english/cognition|website = www.oxforddictionaries.com|access-date = 2016-02-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; It encompasses processes such as [[attention]], the formation of [[knowledge]], [[memory]] and [[working memory]], [[Value judgment|judgment]] and [[evaluation]], [[reason]]ing and "[[computation]]", [[problem solving]] and [[decision making]], [[comprehension (logic)|comprehension]] and production of [[language]]. Cognitive processes use existing knowledge and generate new knowledge.

The processes are analyzed from different perspectives within different contexts, notably in the fields of [[linguistics]], [[anesthesia]], [[neuroscience]], [[psychiatry]], [[psychology]], [[education]], [[philosophy]], [[anthropology]], [[biology]], [[systemics]], [[logic]], and [[computer science]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Von Eckardt|first=Barbara|title=What is cognitive science?|year=1996|publisher=MIT Press|location=Massachusetts|pages=45-72|url=https://books.google.com/?id=E8l48-DZln0C&amp;pg=PA13&amp;dq=what+is+cognition#v=onepage&amp;q=what%20is%20cognition&amp;f=false|isbn=9780262720236}}&lt;/ref&gt; These and other different approaches to the analysis of cognition are synthesised in the developing field of [[cognitive science]], a progressively autonomous [[academic discipline]].

== Etymology ==
The word ''cognition'' comes from the [[Latin]] verb ''cognosco'' (''con'', 'with', and ''gnōscō'', 'know'; itself a cognate of the [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] verb γι(γ)νώσκω, ''gi(g)nόsko'', meaning 'I know, perceive'), meaning 'to conceptualize' or 'to recognize'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Search for a Theory of Cognition: Early Mechanisms and New Ideas|author=Stefano Franchi, Francesco Bianchini|publisher=Rodopi, 2011|chapter=On The Historical Dynamics Of Cognitive Science: A View From The Periphery|page=XIV}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== The beginnings of the studies on cognition ==
The word ''cognition'' dates back to the 15th century, when it meant "thinking and awareness".&lt;ref&gt;Cognition: Theory and Practice by Russell Revlin&lt;/ref&gt; Attention to cognitive processes came about more than eighteen centuries earlier, however, beginning with [[Aristotle]] (384–322 BC) and his interest in the inner workings of the mind and how they affect the human experience. Aristotle focused on cognitive areas pertaining to memory, perception, and mental imagery. He placed great importance on ensuring that his studies were based on empirical evidence, that is, scientific information that is gathered through observation and conscientious experimentation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Matlin|first=Margaret|title=Cognition|year=2009|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc.|location=Hoboken, NJ|page=4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Two millennia later, as [[psychology]] emerged as a burgeoning field of study in Europe and then gained a following in America, other scientists like Wilhelm Wundt, Herman Ebbinghaus, Mary Whiton Calkins, and William James would offer their contributions to the study of human cognition.

[[Wilhelm Wundt]] (1832–1920) emphasized the notion of what he called introspection: examining the inner feelings of an individual. With introspection, the subject had to be careful to describe his or her feelings in the most objective manner possible in order for Wundt to find the information scientific.&lt;ref name="Fuchs"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Fuchs|first=A. H.|author2=Milar, K.J.|title=Psychology as a science|journal=Handbook of psychology|year=2003|volume=1|issue=The history of psychology|pages=1–26|doi=10.1002/0471264385.wei0101}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Zangwill|first=O. L.|title=The Oxford companion to the mind|year=2004|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=New York|pages=951–952}}&lt;/ref&gt; Though Wundt's contributions are by no means minimal, modern psychologists find his methods to be quite subjective and choose to rely on more objective procedures of experimentation to make conclusions about the human cognitive process.

[[Hermann Ebbinghaus]] (1850–1909) conducted cognitive studies that mainly examined the function and capacity of human memory. Ebbinghaus developed his own experiment in which he constructed over 2,000 syllables made out of nonexistent words, for instance EAS. He then examined his own personal ability to learn these non-words. He purposely chose non-words as opposed to real words to control for the influence of pre-existing experience on what the words might symbolize, thus enabling easier recollection of them.&lt;ref name=Fuchs /&gt;&lt;ref name= "Zangwill"&gt;{{cite book|last=Zangwill|first=O.L.|title=The Oxford companion to the mind|year=2004|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=New York|page=276}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ebbinghaus observed and hypothesized a number of variables that may have affected his ability to learn and recall the non-words he created. One of the reasons, he concluded, was the amount of time between the presentation of the list of stimuli and the recitation or recall of same.  Ebbinghaus was the first to record and plot a "learning curve," and a "forgetting curve."&lt;ref&gt;T.L. Brink (2008) Psychology: A Student Friendly Approach. "Unit 7: Memory." p. 126&lt;/ref&gt; His work heavily influenced the study of serial position and its effect on memory, discussed in subsequent sections.

[[Mary Whiton Calkins]] (1863–1930) was an influential American pioneer in the realm of psychology. Her work also focused on the human memory capacity. A common theory, called the [[recency effect]], can be attributed to the studies that she conducted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Madigan|first=S.|author2=O'Hara, R.|title=Short-term memory at the turn of the century: Mary Whiton Calkin's memory research|journal=American Psychologist|year=1992|volume=47|pages=170–174|doi=10.1037/0003-066X.47.2.170|issue=2}}&lt;/ref&gt; The recency effect, also discussed in the subsequent experiment section, is the tendency for individuals to be able to accurately recollect the final items presented in a sequence of stimuli. Calkin's theory is closely related to the aforementioned study and conclusion of the memory experiments conducted by Hermann Ebbinghaus.&lt;ref name="Matlin"&gt;{{cite book|last=Matlin|first=Margaret|title=Cognition|year=2009|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc.|location=Hoboken, NJ|page=5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[William James]] (1842–1910) is another pivotal figure in the history of cognitive science. James was quite discontent with Wundt's emphasis on introspection and Ebbinghaus' use of nonsense stimuli. He instead chose to focus on the human learning experience in everyday life and its importance to the study of cognition. James' most significant contribution to the study and theory of cognition was his textbook ''Principles of Psychology'' that preliminarily examines aspects of cognition such as perception, memory, reasoning, and attention.&lt;ref name=Matlin /&gt;

== In psychology ==
[[File:Generalization process using trees PNG version.png|thumb|alt=Diagram|When the mind makes a generalization such as the [[concept]] of ''tree'', it extracts similarities from numerous examples; the simplification enables higher-level thinking (abstract thinking).]]
In psychology, the term "cognition" is usually used within an [[information processing]] view of an individual's psychological [[functionalism (philosophy of mind)|functions]] (see [[cognitivism (psychology)|cognitivism]]),&lt;ref name="Sternberg2009"&gt;Sternberg, R. J., &amp; Sternberg, K. (2009). Cognitive psychology (6th Ed.). Belmont, CA: Wadsworth, Cengage Learning.&lt;/ref&gt; and it is the same in [[cognitive engineering]];&lt;ref name="Blomberg"&gt;{{cite journal|author = Blomberg, O.|year = 2011|title = Concepts of cognition for cognitive engineering|journal = [[International Journal of Aviation Psychology]]|volume = 21|issue = 1|pages = 85–104|doi = 10.1080/10508414.2011.537561}}&lt;/ref&gt; in a branch of [[social psychology]] called [[social cognition]], the term is used to explain [[Attitude (psychology)|attitudes]], [[Attribution (psychology)|attribution]], and group dynamics.&lt;ref name="Sternberg2009"/&gt;

Human cognition is conscious and unconscious, concrete or abstract, as well as intuitive (like knowledge of a language) and conceptual (like a model of a language). It encompasses processes such as [[memory]], [[Association of Ideas|association]], [[concept formation]], [[pattern recognition]], [[language]], [[attention]], [[perception]], [[action (philosophy)|action]], [[problem solving]] and [[mental images|mental imagery]].&lt;ref&gt;''Sensation &amp; Perception'', 5th ed. 1999, Coren, Ward &amp; Enns, p. 9&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Cognitive Psychology'', 5th ed. 1999, Best, John B., pp. 15–17&lt;/ref&gt; Traditionally, [[emotion]] was not thought of as a cognitive process, but now much research is being undertaken to examine the [[cognitive psychology]] of emotion; research is also focused on one's awareness of one's own strategies and methods of cognition, which is called [[metacognition]].

While few people would deny that cognitive processes are a function of the [[brain]], a cognitive theory will not necessarily make reference to the brain or to biological processes (compare [[neurocognitive]]). It may purely describe behavior in terms of information flow or function. Relatively recent fields of study such as [[neuropsychology]] aim to bridge this gap, using cognitive paradigms to understand how the brain implements the information-processing functions (see also [[cognitive neuroscience]]), or to understand how pure information-processing systems (e.g., computers) can simulate human cognition (see also [[artificial intelligence]]). The branch of psychology that studies brain injury to infer normal cognitive function is called [[cognitive neuropsychology]]. The links of cognition to [[evolution]]ary demands are studied through the investigation of [[animal cognition]].

=== Piaget's theory of cognitive development ===
For years, sociologists and psychologists have conducted studies on [[cognitive development]] or the construction of human thought or mental processes.

[[Jean Piaget]] was one of the most important and influential people in the field of Developmental Psychology. He believed that humans are unique in comparison to animals because we have the capacity to do "abstract symbolic reasoning." His work can be compared to [[Lev Vygotsky]], [[Sigmund Freud]], and [[Erik Erikson]] who were also great contributors in the field of Developmental Psychology. Today, Piaget is known for studying the cognitive development in children. He studied his own three children and their intellectual development and came up with a theory that describes the stages children pass through during development.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Cherry|first=Kendra|title=Jean Piaget Biography|url=http://psychology.about.com/od/profilesofmajorthinkers/p/piaget.htm|publisher=The New York Times Company|accessdate=18 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Common experiments on human cognition ===
'''Serial position'''

The serial position experiment is meant to test a theory of memory that states that when information is given in a serial manner, we tend to remember information in the beginning of the sequence, called the primacy effect, and information in the end of the sequence, called the recency effect.  Consequently, information given in the middle of the sequence is typically forgotten, or not recalled as easily. This study predicts that the recency effect is stronger than the primacy effect, because the information that is most recently learned is still in working memory when asked to be recalled. Information that is learned first still has to go through a retrieval process. This experiment focuses on human memory processes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Surprenant|first=A|title=Distinctiveness and serial position effects in total sequences|journal=Perception and Psychophysics|year=2001|volume=63|pages=737–745|doi=10.3758/BF03194434|pmid=11436742|issue=4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Word superiority'''

The word superiority experiment presents a subject with a word, or a letter by itself, for a brief period of time, i.e. 40ms, and they are then asked to recall the letter that was in a particular location in the word. By theory, the subject should be better able to correctly recall the letter when it was presented in a word than when it was presented in isolation. This experiment focuses on human speech and language.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Krueger|first=L.|title=The word-superiority effect and phonological recoding|journal=Memory &amp; Cognition|year=1992|volume=20|pages=685–694|doi=10.3758/BF03202718|issue=6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Brown-Peterson'''

In the Brown-Peterson experiment, participants are briefly presented with a trigram and in one particular version of the experiment, they are then given a distractor task, asking them to identify whether a sequence of words are in fact words, or non-words (due to being misspelled, etc.). After the distractor task, they are asked to recall the trigram from before the distractor task. In theory, the longer the distractor task, the harder it will be for participants to correctly recall the trigram. This experiment focuses on human short-term memory.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Nairne|first=J.|author2=Whiteman, H. |author3=Kelley, M. |title=Short-term forgetting of order under conditions of reduced interference|journal=Quarterly Journal of Experimental Psychology A: Human Experimental Psychology|year=1999|volume=52|pages=241–251|doi=10.1080/713755806|url=http://www1.psych.purdue.edu/~nairne/pdfs/32.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Memory span'''

During the memory span experiment, each subject is presented with a sequence of stimuli of the same kind; words depicting objects, numbers, letters that sound similar, and letters that sound dissimilar. After being presented with the stimuli, the subject is asked to recall the sequence of stimuli that they were given in the exact order in which it was given. In one particular version of the experiment, if the subject recalled a list correctly, the list length was increased by one for that type of material, and vice versa if it was recalled incorrectly. The theory is that people have a memory span of about seven items for numbers, the same for letters that sound dissimilar and short words. The memory span is projected to be shorter with letters that sound similar and with longer words.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=May|first=C.|author2=Hasher, L. |author3=Kane, M. |title=The role of interference in memory span|journal=Memory &amp; Cognition|year=1999|volume=27|pages=759–767|doi=10.3758/BF03198529|issue=5|pmid=10540805}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Visual search'''

In one version of the visual search experiment, a participant is presented with a window that displays circles and squares scattered across it. The participant is to identify whether there is a green circle on the window. In the "featured" search, the subject is presented with several trial windows that have blue squares or circles and one green circle or no green circle in it at all. In the "conjunctive" search, the subject is presented with trial windows that have blue circles or green squares and a present or absent green circle whose presence the participant is asked to identify. What is expected is that in the feature searches, reaction time, that is the time it takes for a participant to identify whether a green circle is present or not, should not change as the number of distractors increases. Conjunctive searches where the target is absent should have a longer reaction time than the conjunctive searches where the target is present. The theory is that in feature searches, it is easy to spot the target, or if it is absent, because of the difference in color between the target and the distractors. In conjunctive searches where the target is absent, reaction time increases because the subject has to look at each shape to determine whether it is the target or not because some of the distractors if not all of them, are the same color as the target stimuli. Conjunctive searches where the target is present take less time because if the target is found, the search between each shape stops.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Wolfe|first=J. |author2=Cave, K. |author3=Franzel, S.|title=Guided search: An alternative to the feature integration model for visual search|journal=Journal of Experimental Psychology: Human Perception and Performance|year=1989|volume=15|pages=419–433|doi=10.1037/0096-1523.15.3.419|issue=3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Knowledge representation'''

The [[semantic network]] of [[knowledge representation]] systems has been studied in various paradigms. One of the oldest paradigms is the [[leveling]] and [[sharpening]] of stories as they are repeated from memory studied by [[Frederic Bartlett|Bartlett]]. The [[semantic differential]] used [[factor analysis]] to determine the main meanings of words, finding that [[value (ethics)|value]] or "goodness" of words is the first factor. More controlled experiments examine the categorical relationships of words in [[free recall]]. The hierarchical structure of words has been explicitly mapped in [[George Armitage Miller|George Miller]]'s [[Wordnet]]. More dynamic models of semantic networks have been created and tested with [[neural network]] experiments based on computational systems such as [[latent semantic analysis]] (LSA), [[Thomas Bayes|Bayesian]] analysis, and multidimensional [[factor analysis]]. The semantics (meaning) of words is studied by all the disciplines of [[cognitive science]].{{citation needed|date=May 2013}}

=== Recent developments ===
An emergent field of research, referred to as "Team Cognition", is arising in military sciences. "Team cognition" indicates “an emergent property of teams that results from the interplay of individual cognition and team process behaviors [...] [Team cognition] underlies team performance” (Arizona State University East, 2005, Cooke NJ, 2005).&lt;ref&gt;Russo, M.; Fiedler, E.; Thomas, M.; McGhee (2005),  United States Army Aeromedical Research Laboratory.

A report (sponsored by [[McAfee]]), published in 2014, estimated that the annual damage to the global economy was $445 billion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2014/06/09/us-cybersecurity-mcafee-csis-idUSKBN0EK0SV20140609 |title=Cyber crime costs global economy $445 billion a year: report |publisher=Reuters |date=2014-06-09 |accessdate=2014-06-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; Approximately $1.5 billion was lost in 2012 to online credit and debit card fraud in the US.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://northdenvernews.com/cybercrime-costs-victims/|title=#Cybercrime— what are the costs to victims - North Denver News|work=North Denver News|accessdate=16 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2018, a study by [[Center for Strategic and International Studies]] (CSIS), in partnership with [[McAfee]], concludes that close to $600 billion, nearly one percent of global GDP, is lost to cybercrime each year.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Lewis|first=James|date=February 2018|title=Economic Impact of Cybercrime - No Slowing Down|url=https://www.mcafee.com/enterprise/en-us/assets/reports/restricted/rp-economic-impact-cybercrime.pdf|journal=|volume=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Financial fraud crimes===
{{Main|Internet fraud}}
[[Computer fraud]] is any dishonest misrepresentation of fact intended to let another to do or refrain from doing something which causes loss. In this context, the fraud will result in obtaining a benefit by:

* Altering in an unauthorized way. This requires little technical expertise and is common form of theft by employees altering the data before entry or entering false data, or by entering unauthorized instructions or using unauthorized processes;
* Altering, destroying, suppressing, or stealing output, usually to conceal unauthorized transactions. This is difficult to detect;
* Altering or deleting stored data;
Other forms of fraud may be facilitated using computer systems, including [[bank fraud]], [[Carding (fraud)|carding]], [[identity theft]], [[extortion]], and [[Classified information|theft of classified information]].

A variety of [[Internet fraud|internet scams]], many based on [[phishing]] and [[social engineering (security)|social engineering]], target consumers and businesses.

===Cyberterrorism===
{{Main|Cyberterrorism}}
Government officials and [[information technology]] security specialists have documented a significant increase in Internet problems and server scans since early 2001. But there is a growing concern among government agencies such as the [[Federal Bureau of Investigations]] (FBI) and the [[Central Intelligence Agency]] (CIA) that such intrusions are part of an organized effort by [[cyberterrorist]]s, foreign intelligence services, or other groups to map potential security holes in critical systems.&lt;ref name="books.google.com"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Laqueur|first1=Walter|last2=C.|first2=Smith|last3=Spector|first3=Michael|title=Cyberterrorism|date=2002|publisher=Facts on File|pages=52–53|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=H7fT0BQxwDsC&amp;pg=PA49}}&lt;/ref&gt; A cyberterrorist is someone who intimidates or coerces a government or an organization to advance his or her political or social objectives by launching a computer-based attack against computers, networks, or the information stored on them.

Cyberterrorism in general can be defined as an act of [[terrorism]] committed through the use of cyberspace or computer resources (Parker 1983). As such, a simple propaganda piece in the Internet that there will be bomb attacks during the holidays can be considered cyberterrorism. There are also hacking activities directed towards individuals, families, organized by groups within networks, tending to cause fear among people, demonstrate power, collecting information relevant for ruining peoples' lives, robberies, [[blackmail]]ing etc.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://sentinelone.com/blogs/cybercriminals-need-shopping-money-holidays/|title=Cybercriminals Need Shopping Money in 2017, Too! - SentinelOne|website=sentinelone.com|language=en-US|access-date=2017-03-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cyberextortion===
{{Main|Extortion}}
Cyberextortion occurs when a website, e-mail server, or computer system is subjected to or threatened with repeated denial of service or other attacks by malicious hackers. These hackers demand money in return for promising to stop the attacks and to offer "protection". According to the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation]], cybercrime extortionists are increasingly attacking corporate websites and networks, crippling their ability to operate and demanding payments to restore their service. More than 20 cases are reported each month to the FBI and many go unreported in order to keep the victim's name out of the public domain. Perpetrators typically use a [[distributed denial-of-service attack]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.ere-security.ca/PDF/Cyberextortion%20by%20DoS,%20Risk%20Magazine%20June%202006.pdf | title=Cyberextortion by Denial-of-Service Attack | author=Lepofsky, Ron | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110706175959/http://www.ere-security.ca/PDF/Cyberextortion%20by%20DoS%2C%20Risk%20Magazine%20June%202006.pdf | archivedate=July 6, 2011 | deadurl=yes | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  However, other cyberextortion techniques exist such as [[doxing]] extortion and [[Bug Poaching|bug poaching]].

An example of cyberextortion was [[Sony Pictures Entertainment hack|the attack on Sony Pictures of 2014]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Mohanta|first1=Abhijit|title=Latest Sony Pictures Breach : A Deadly Cyber Extortion |url=http://www.cyphort.com/latest-sony-pictures-breach-deadly-cyber-extortion/|accessdate=20 September 2015|date=6 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cyberwarfare===
[[File:U.S. Navy Cyber Defense Operations Command monitor.jpg|thumb|220px|Sailors analyze, detect and defensively respond to unauthorized activity within [[U.S. Navy]] information systems and computer networks]]
{{Main|Cyberwarfare}}
The U.S. [[United States Department of Defense|Department of Defense]] (DoD) notes that the cyberspace has emerged as a national-level concern through several recent events of geostrategic significance. Among those are included, the attack on [[Estonia]]'s infrastructure in 2007, allegedly by Russian hackers. "In August 2008, Russia again allegedly conducted cyberattacks, this time in a coordinated and synchronized kinetic and non-kinetic campaign against the country of [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]]. The [[December 2015 Ukraine power grid cyberattack]] has also been attributed to Russia and is considered the first successful cyberattack on a power grid.{{Citation needed|date=April 2018}} Fearing that such attacks may become the norm in future warfare among nation-states, the concept of cyberspace operations impacts and will be adapted by warfighting military commanders in the future.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120320012856/http://www.carlisle.army.mil/DIME/documents/War%20is%20War%20Issue%20Paper%20Final2.pdf|title=War is War?

===Computer as a target===
These crimes are committed by a selected group of criminals. Unlike crimes using the computer as a tool, these crimes require the technical knowledge of the perpetrators. As such, as technology evolves, so too does the nature of the crime. These crimes are relatively new, having been in existence for only as long as computers have—which explains how unprepared society and the world in general is towards combating these crimes. There are numerous crimes of this nature committed daily on the internet.

Crimes that primarily target computer networks or devices include:
*[[Computer viruses]]
*[[Denial-of-service attacks]]
*[[Malware]] (malicious code)

===Computer as a tool===
{{Main|Internet fraud|Spamming|Phishing|Carding (fraud)}}
When the individual is the main target of cybercrime, the computer can be considered as the tool rather than the target. These crimes generally involve less technical expertise. Human weaknesses are generally exploited. The damage dealt is largely [[psychological]] and intangible, making legal action against the variants more difficult. These are the crimes which have existed for centuries in the offline world. [[Scams]], theft, and the likes have existed even before the development in high-tech equipment. The same criminal has simply been given a tool which increases their potential pool of victims and makes them all the harder to trace and apprehend.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Cyber Crime definition|url=http://www.crime-research.org/articles/joseph06/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Crimes that use computer networks or devices to advance other ends include:
*[[Fraud]] and [[identity theft]] (although this increasingly uses malware, hacking or phishing, making it an example of both "computer as target" and "computer as tool" crime)
*[[Information warfare]]
*[[Phishing|Phishing scams]]
*[[E-mail spam|Spam]]
*Propagation of illegal obscene or offensive content, including harassment and threats

The unsolicited sending of bulk [[email]] for commercial purposes ([[Email spam|spam]]) is unlawful [[E-mail spam legislation by country|in some jurisdictions]].

[[Phishing]] is mostly propagated via email. Phishing emails may contain links to other websites that are affected by malware.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Save browsing|url=http://googleonlinesecurity.blogspot.jp/2012/06/safe-browsing-protecting-web-users-for.html|website=google}}&lt;/ref&gt; Or, they may contain links to fake [[online banking]] or other websites used to steal private account information.

====Obscene or offensive content====
The content of websites and other electronic communications may be distasteful, [[obscene]] or offensive for a variety of reasons. In some instances these communications may be illegal.

The extent to which these communications are unlawful varies greatly between countries, and even within nations. It is a sensitive area in which the courts can become involved in arbitrating between groups with strong beliefs.

One area of [[Internet pornography]] that has been the target of the strongest efforts at curtailment is [[child pornography]], which is illegal in most jurisdictions in the world.

=====Online harassment{{anchor|Harassment}}=====
[[File:Online harassment lit review.jpg|Various aspects needed to be considered when understanding [[harassment]] online.|792x792px]]
{{Globalize|section|date=March 2016}}
{{See also|Cyberbullying|Online predator|Cyberstalking|5=Internet troll}}

Whereas content may be offensive in a non-specific way, [[harassment]] directs obscenities and derogatory comments at specific individuals focusing for example on gender, race, religion, nationality, sexual orientation. This often occurs in chat rooms, through newsgroups, and by sending hate e-mail to interested parties. Harassment on the internet also includes [[revenge porn]].

There are instances where committing a crime using a computer can lead to an enhanced sentence.  For example, in the case of [[United States v. Neil Scott Kramer]], Kramer was served an enhanced sentence according to the [[U.S. Sentencing Guidelines Manual]] §2G1.3(b)(3)&lt;ref name="2011 U.S. Sentencing Guidelines Manual"/&gt; for his use of a [[cell phone]] to "persuade, induce, entice, coerce, or facilitate the travel of, the minor to engage in prohibited sexual conduct." Kramer argued that this claim was insufficient because his charge included persuading through a computer device and his cellular phone technically is not a computer. Although Kramer tried to argue this point, U.S. Sentencing Guidelines Manual states that the term computer "means an electronic, magnetic, optical, [[Electrochemistry|electrochemically]], or other high-speed data processing device performing logical, arithmetic, or storage functions, and includes any data storage facility or communications facility directly related to or operating in conjunction with such device."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://leg1.state.va.us/cgi-bin/legp504.exe?000+cod+18.2-152.7C1 |title=United States of America v. Neil Scott Kramer |date= |accessdate=2013-10-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Connecticut]] was the U.S. state to pass a statute making it a criminal offense to harass someone by computer. [[Michigan]], [[Arizona]], and [[Virginia]] and [[South Carolina]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.victimsofcrime.org/our-programs/stalking-resource-center/stalking-laws/criminal-stalking-laws-by-state/south-Carolina|title=South Carolina|publisher=|accessdate=16 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; have also passed laws banning harassment by electronic means.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nerac.com/family/NeracReports/Cybercrimes_CT.htm |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080410230359/http://www.nerac.com/family/NeracReports/Cybercrimes_CT.htm|archivedate= April 10, 2008|title=1.

Harassment as defined in the U.S. computer statutes is typically distinct from cyberbullying, in that the former usually relates to a person's "use a computer or computer network to communicate obscene, vulgar, profane, lewd, lascivious, or indecent language, or make any suggestion or proposal of an obscene nature, or threaten any illegal or immoral act," while the latter need not involve anything of a sexual nature.

Although [[freedom of speech]] is protected by law in most democratic societies (in the [[US]] this is done by the [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|First Amendment]]), it does not include all types of speech. In fact spoken or written "true threat" speech/text is criminalized because of "intent to harm or intimidate", that also applies for online or any type of network related threats in written text or speech.&lt;ref name="brenner"&gt;Susan W. Brenner, ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=gsWQ-xgbLbUC&amp;lpg=PA130 Cybercrime: Criminal Threats from Cyberspace]'', ABC-CLIO, 2010, pp. 91&lt;/ref&gt; The US [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]] definition of "true threat" is "statements where the speaker means to communicate a serious expression of an intent to commit an act of unlawful violence to a particular individual or group".&lt;ref name="brenner"/&gt;

==Drug trafficking==
[[Darknet market]]s are used to buy and sell [[Recreational drug use|recreational drugs]] online. Some [[drug trafficker]]s use [[End-to-end encryption|encrypted]] messaging tools to communicate with drug mules. The [[dark web]] site [[Silk Road (marketplace)|Silk Road]] was a major online marketplace for drugs before it was shut down by law enforcement (then reopened under new management, and then shut down by law enforcement again). After [[Silk Road (marketplace)|Silk Road]] 2.0 went down, [[Silk Road (marketplace)|Silk Road]] 3 Reloaded emerged. However, it was just an older marketplace named [[Darknet market|Diabolus Market]], that used the name for more exposure from the brand's previous success.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.dailydot.com/layer8/silk-road-3-blake-benthall/|title=We talked to the opportunist imitator behind Silk Road 3.0|date=2014-11-07|access-date=2016-10-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Documented cases==

* One of the highest profiled banking computer crime occurred during a course of three years beginning in 1970. The chief teller at the Park Avenue branch of New York's [[Union Dime Savings Bank]] embezzled over $1.5 million from hundreds of accounts.&lt;ref name="Weitzer" /&gt;
*  A hacking group called MOD (Masters of Deception), allegedly stole passwords and technical data from [[Pacific Bell]], [[Nynex]], and other telephone companies as well as several big credit agencies and two major universities. The damage caused was extensive, one company, [[Southwestern Bell]] suffered losses of $370,000 alone.&lt;ref name="Weitzer" /&gt;

* Between 1995 and 1998 the [[News Corporation|Newscorp]] satellite pay to view encrypted [[Sky Digital (UK &amp; Ireland)|SKY-TV]] service was hacked several times during an ongoing technological [[arms race]] between a pan-European hacking group and Newscorp. The original motivation of the hackers was to watch Star Trek reruns in Germany; which was something which Newscorp did not have the copyright to allow.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=David Mann And Mike Sutton |url=http://bjc.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/short/38/2/201 |title=&gt;&gt;Netcrime |publisher=Bjc.oxfordjournals.org |date=2011-11-06 |accessdate=2011-11-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* On 26 March 1999, the [[Melissa (computer virus)|Melissa worm]] infected a document on a victim's computer, then automatically sent that document and a copy of the virus spread via e-mail to other people.
* In February 2000, an individual going by the alias of [[MafiaBoy]] began a series [[denial-of-service attack]]s against high-profile websites, including [[Yahoo!]], [[Dell, Inc.]], [[E*TRADE]], [[eBay]], and [[CNN]]. About 50 computers at [[Stanford University]], and also computers at the University of California at Santa Barbara, were amongst the [[zombie computer]]s sending pings in [[DDoS]] attacks. On 3 August 2000, Canadian federal prosecutors charged [[MafiaBoy]] with 54 counts of illegal access to computers, plus a total of ten counts of mischief to data for his attacks.
* The [[Stuxnet]] worm corrupted SCADA microprocessors, particularly of the types used in [[Siemens]] centrifuge controllers.
* The [[Russian Business Network]] (RBN) was registered as an internet site in 2006. Initially, much of its activity was legitimate. But apparently, the founders soon discovered that it was more profitable to host illegitimate activities and started hiring its services to criminals. The RBN has been described by [[VeriSign]] as "the baddest of the bad".&lt;ref name="econ20070930"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://economist.com/displaystory.cfm?story_id=9723768 |title=A walk on the dark side |publisher=The Economist |date=2007-09-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; It offers web hosting services and internet access to all kinds of criminal and objectionable activities, with individual activities earning up to $150 million in one year. It specialized in and in some cases monopolized [[Personally identifiable information|personal identity theft]] for resale. It is the originator of [[MPack (software)|MPack]] and an alleged operator of the now defunct [[Storm botnet]].
* On 2 March 2010, Spanish investigators arrested 3{{Clarify|date=June 2011}} in infection of over 13 million computers around the world. The "botnet" of infected computers included PCs inside more than half of the [[Fortune 1000]] companies and more than 40 major banks, according to investigators.
* In August 2010 the international investigation [[Operation Delego]], operating under the aegis of the [[Department of Homeland Security]], shut down the international [[pedophilia|pedophile]] ring Dreamboard. The website had approximately 600 members and may have distributed up to 123 [[terabyte]]s of child pornography (roughly equivalent to 16,000 DVDs).

==Combating computer crime==

{{Expand section|date=January 2015}}

===Diffusion of cybercrime===
The broad diffusion of cybercriminal activities is an issue in computer crimes detection and prosecution.
According to Jean-Loup Richet (Research Fellow at ESSEC ISIS), technical expertise and accessibility no longer act as barriers to entry into cybercrime.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Richet|first1=Jean-Loup|title=From Young Hackers to Crackers|journal=International Journal of Technology and Human Interaction|date=2013|volume=9|issue=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Indeed, hacking is much less complex than it was a few years ago, as hacking communities have greatly diffused their knowledge through the Internet. Blogs and communities have hugely contributed to information sharing: beginners could benefit from older hackers' knowledge and advice. Furthermore, hacking is cheaper than ever: before the [[cloud computing]] era, in order to spam or scam one needed a dedicated server, skills in server management, network configuration, and maintenance, knowledge of Internet service provider standards, etc. By comparison, a mail [[software-as-a-service]] is a scalable, inexpensive, bulk, and transactional e-mail-sending service for marketing purposes and could be easily set up for [[Email spam|spam]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Richet|first1=Jean-Loup|title=Adoption of deviant behavior and cybercrime 'Know how' diffusion|journal=York Deviancy Conference|date=2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jean-Loup Richet explains that cloud computing could be helpful for a cybercriminal as a way to leverage his attack – brute-forcing a password, improve the reach of a [[botnet]], or facilitating a spamming campaign.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Richet|first1=Jean-Loup|title=How to Become a Black Hat Hacker? An Exploratory Study of Barriers to Entry Into Cybercrime.|journal=17th AIM Symposium|date=2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Investigation===
A computer can be a source of [[evidence]] (see [[digital forensics]]). Even where a computer is not directly used for criminal purposes, it may contain records of value to criminal investigators in the form of a [[logfile]]. In most countries{{Citation needed|date = January 2015}} [[Internet Service Providers]] are required, by law, to keep their logfiles for a predetermined amount of time. For example; a European wide [[Data Retention Directive]] (applicable to all [[European Union|EU]] [[member states]]) states that all [[e-mail]] traffic should be retained for a minimum of 12 months.

Methodology of cybercrime investigation

There are many ways for cybercrime to take place, and investigations tend to start with an [[IP Address]] trace, however that is not necessarily a factual basis upon which detectives can solve a case. Different types of high-tech crime may also include elements of low-tech crime, and vice versa, making cybercrime investigators an indispensable part of modern law-enforcement. [[Methodology]] of cybercrime detective work is dynamic and is constantly improving, whether in closed police units, or in international cooperation framework.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.unafei.or.jp/english/pdf/RS_No79/No79_15RC_Group2.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

===Legislation===
Due to easily exploitable laws, cybercriminals use developing countries in order to evade detection and prosecution from law enforcement. In developing countries, such as the [[Philippines]], laws against cybercrime are weak or sometimes nonexistent. These weak laws allow cybercriminals to strike from international borders and remain undetected. Even when identified, these criminals avoid being punished or extradited to a country, such as the [[United States]], that has developed laws that allow for prosecution. While this proves difficult in some cases, agencies, such as the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]], have used deception and subterfuge to catch criminals. For example, two Russian hackers had been evading the FBI for some time. The FBI set up a fake computing company based in Seattle, Washington. They proceeded to lure the two Russian men into the United States by offering them work with this company. Upon completion of the interview, the suspects were arrested outside of the building. Clever tricks like this are sometimes a necessary part of catching cybercriminals when weak legislation makes it impossible otherwise.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Kshetri|first=Nir|title= Diffusion and Effects of Cyber Crime in Developing Countries|url=http://web.a.ebscohost.com/ehost/detail/detail?vid=3&amp;sid=21efdb54-ad43-447f-ab46-ce7fa854a98f%40sessionmgr4003&amp;hid=4109&amp;bdata=JnNpdGU9ZWhvc3QtbGl2ZQ%3d%3d#db=buh&amp;AN=55328703/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

President [[Barack Obama]] released in an executive order in April 2015 to combat cybercrime. The executive order allows the United States to freeze assets of convicted cybercriminals and block their economic activity within the United States. This is some of the first solid legislation that combats cybercrime in this way.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Northam|first=Jackie|title=U.S. Creates First Sanctions Program Against Cybercriminals|url=https://www.npr.org/blogs/thetwo-way/2015/04/01/396811276/u-s-creates-first-sanctions-program-against-cybercriminals/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The European Union adopted directive 2013/40/EU. All offences of the directive, and other definitions and procedural institutions are also in the [[Council of Europe]]'s [[Convention on Cybercrime]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | url=http://jolas.ro/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/jolas_sia38.pdf | title=Analysis of Directive 2013/40/EU on attacks against information systems in the context of approximation of law at the European level | author=Adrian Cristian MOISE | journal=Journal of Law and Administrative Sciences | year=2015 | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151208231600/http://jolas.ro/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/jolas_sia38.pdf | archivedate=December 8, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Penalties===
Penalties for computer-related crimes in [[New York (state)|New York]] State can range from a fine and a short period of jail time for a Class A misdemeanor such as unauthorized use of a computer up to computer tampering in the first degree which is a Class C felony and can carry 3 to 15 years in prison.{{citation needed|date=March 2016}}

However, some [[Hacker (computer security)|hackers]] have been hired as [[information security]] experts by private companies due to their inside knowledge of computer crime, a phenomenon which theoretically could create [[Moral hazard|perverse incentives]]. A possible counter to this is for courts to ban convicted hackers from using the Internet or computers, even after they have been released from prison{{Spaced ndash}}though as computers and the Internet become more and more central to everyday life, this type of punishment may be viewed as more and more harsh and draconian. However, nuanced approaches have been developed that manage cyber offenders behavior without resorting to total computer or Internet bans.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Managing the Risks Posed by Offender Computer Use - Perspectives|date=December 2011|url=http://appaweb.csg.org/Perspectives/Perspectives_V35_N4_P40.pdf|format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt; These approaches involve restricting individuals to specific devices which are subject to computer monitoring or computer searches by probation or parole officers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Bowker |first=Art |year=2012 |title=The Cybercrime Handbook for Community Corrections: Managing Risk in the 21st Century |location=Springfield |publisher=Thomas |isbn=9780398087289 |url=http://www.ccthomas.com/details.cfm?P_ISBN13=9780398087289}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Awareness ===
As technology advances and more people rely on the internet to store sensitive information such as banking or credit card information, criminals increasingly attempt to steal that information.  Cybercrime is becoming more of a threat to people across the world. Raising awareness about how information is being protected and the tactics criminals use to steal that information continues to grow in importance. According to the FBI's Internet Crime Complaint Center in 2014, there were 269,422 complaints filed. With all the claims combined there was a reported total loss of $800,492,073.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://pdf.ic3.gov/2014_IC3Report.pdf|title=2014 Internet Crime Report|last=|first=|date=2015|website=[[Internet Crime Complaint Center]] (IC3)|access-date=2017-10-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; But cybercrime does yet seem to be on the average person's radar. There are 1.5 million cyber-attacks annually, that means that there are over 4,000 attacks a day, 170 attacks every hour, or nearly three attacks every minute, with studies showing us that only 16% of victims had asked the people who were carrying out the attacks to stop.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Feinberg|first=T|year=2008|title=Whether it happens at school or off-campus, cyberbullying disrupts and affects.|url=|journal=Cyberbullying|volume=|pages=10|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Anybody who uses the internet for any reason can be a victim, which is why it is important to be aware of how one is being protected while online.

=== Intelligence ===
As cybercrime has proliferated, a professional ecosystem has evolved to support individuals and groups seeking to profit from cybercriminal activities.  The ecosystem has become quite specialized, including malware developers, botnet operators, professional cybercrime groups, groups specializing in the sale of stolen content, and so forth.  A few of the leading cybersecurity companies have the skills, resources and visibility to follow the activities of these individuals and group.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.symantec.com/content/dam/symantec/docs/security-center/white-papers/dridex-financial-trojan-16-en.pdf|title=Dridex: Tidal waves of spam pushing dangerous financial Trojan|last=|first=|date=|website=symantec.com|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A wide variety of information is available from these sources which can be used for defensive purposes, including technical indicators such as hashes of infected files&lt;ref name="fireeye.com"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.fireeye.com/blog/threat-research/2017/09/apt33-insights-into-iranian-cyber-espionage.html|title=Insights into Iranian Cyber Espionage: APT33 Targets Aerospace and Energy Sectors and has Ties to Destructive Malware « Insights into Iranian Cyber Espionage: APT33 Targets Aerospace and Energy Sectors and has Ties to Destructive Malware|last=|first=|date=|website=FireEye|access-date=2018-01-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; or malicious IPs/URLs,&lt;ref name="fireeye.com"/&gt; as well as strategic information profiling the goals, techniques and campaigns of the profiled groups.  Some of it is freely published, but consistent, on-going access typically requires subscribing to an adversary intelligence subscription service. At the level of an individual threat actor, threat intelligence is often referred to that actor's "TTP", or "tactics, techniques, and procedures," as the infrastructure, tools, and other technical indicators are often trivial for attackers to change. Corporate sectors are considering crucial role of [[artificial intelligence]] cyber security.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/how-ai-can-help-stop-cyberattacks-1537322940|title=How AI Can Help Stop Cyberattacks|last=Janofsky|first=Adam|date=2018-09-19|work=Wall Street Journal|access-date=2018-09-20|language=en-US|issn=0099-9660}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.computerworld.com/article/3081326/security/this-company-uses-ai-to-stop-cyberattacks-before-they-start.html|title=This company uses A.I. to stop cyberattacks before they start|last=Noyes|first=Katherine|work=Computerworld|access-date=2018-09-20|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Digging for the Truth''''' is a [[History (U.S. TV channel)|History Channel]] [[television series]]. The first three seasons of the show focused on host [[Josh Bernstein]], who journeyed on various explorations of historical icons and mysteries. Bernstein is the president and [[CEO]] of [[Boulder Outdoor Survival School|BOSS (Boulder Outdoor Survival School)]] and has a degree in [[anthropology]] and [[psychology]] from [[Cornell University]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.questmagazine.com/z_tonya_morrison_qm200607_s2-digging-for-the-truth-josh-bernstein-history-channel.html Josh Bernstein: Explorer and Anthropologist - Yes; Indiana Jones - No], QuestMagazine.com&lt;/ref&gt; The show airs every Monday night at 9:00 EST on the History Channel. The series premiered in January 2005 and at the time was the highest-rated series currently running on The History Channel, which was surprising{{According to whom|date=March 2016}} given the previous show ''Time Titans'' from the production crew never made it past the pilot.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.news.cornell.edu/stories/March06/JoshBernstein.lgk.html |title=Josh Bernstein profile |last=Grace-Kobas |first=Linda |date=March 8, 2006 |publisher=[[Cornell University]] |accessdate=26 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The third season premiered on January 22, 2007, with a two-hour special event on the quest for [[Atlantis]].

Bernstein announced on February 20, 2007, that he would be leaving The History Channel and ''Digging for the Truth'', and would, as of April, join [[The Discovery Channel]] as an [[executive producer]] and host of a new prime-time series and specials.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/josh-bernstein-joins-discovery-channel-to-create-world-premiere-series-and-specials-58026742.html |title=Josh Bernstein Joins Discovery Channel to Create World Premiere Series and Specials |publisher=[[Discovery Communications]] |accessdate=2 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Hunter Ellis]], host of ''[[Tactical to Practical]]'' and ''[[Man, Moment, Machine]]'' for The History Channel, then replaced Bernstein as host.

Each episode typically deals with an event or subject in history that is not completely understood by modern historians. As such, many of the topics covered are controversial in some respect. Bernstein usually mentioned the various theories that exist on the subject, although the episode may not have explored all of them. He then traveled to various locations to ask questions of researchers, and he often he put himself into situations (e.g. working in a quarry, climbing a rock-face) that simulated the activities of people in the period he explored. Almost all of the researchers he talked to were professionals in the subject at hand, and many of the places he visited (e.g., the inside of a pyramid) are not open to the general public. At the end of each episode, he pulled together everything discussed in the episode to either formulate a hypothesis of what happened or to conclude that what happened remains a mystery.

In late 2006, Bernstein's book ''Digging for the Truth: One Man's Epic Adventure Exploring the World's Greatest Archaeological Mysteries'' was published. In the book, Bernstein writes a bit about his past and BOSS, but it is mostly a behind-the-scene look at various episodes.

== Biography ==

Waples was born in [[Philadelphia, Pennsylvania]].&lt;ref name="Wiegand1990"/&gt;  Waples earned bachelor's and master's degrees from [[Haverford College]] in 1914 and 1915 and a second master's degree from [[Harvard University]] in 1917. After marrying Eleanor Jackson Cary and spending a year in France studying educational psychology, Waples returned to earn a doctoral degree from the University of Pennsylvania in 1920. His dissertation was entitled, "An Approach to the Synthetic Study of Interest in Education."&lt;ref name="Wiegand1990"/&gt;{{rp|148}}  The Waples soon added three daughters to their family.

He served as assistant professor at Tufts College near Boston, and in 1923 Waples accepted a demanding tri-part role at the University of Pittsburgh as assistant dean of the graduate school, assistant professor of secondary education, and extension lecturer in a nearby steel mill town. Soon thereafter he followed his mentor, [[Werrett W. Charters]], to the University of Chicago, where he accepted a position in the Education Department.

In 1926 with funds from the [[Carnegie Corporation of New York|Carnegie Foundation]], the Graduate School of Librarianship was formed with a mandate from Dean George Works to ponder library methodologies. This program was the first library school in the United States to offer a program of doctoral study. Waples then received an appointment as professor of educational method in this new School. He taught and published and, from 1929 to 1932, he served as acting dean four times.&lt;ref name="Wiegand1990"/&gt;{{rp|148}}  Waples identified six goals for the Graduate Library School: he saw a need to legitimize librarianship as a field for graduate research, to confirm a distinction between evidence and assumptions regarding values and methods of administration, to assure adequate training for aspiring public librarians, to meliorate library school instruction, to identify and systematize professional literature, and to promote scholarly publication.&lt;ref name="Wiegand1990"/&gt;{{rp|151}}

Waples’s most influential work was ''People and Print'' (1937), one of four works published in the Studies in Library Science series. It redirected researchers from assumptions and personal beliefs to compelling investigations and quantitative and qualitative explorations.&lt;ref name="Wiegand1990"/&gt;{{rp|149}}  His revolutionary approach to “why people read; what people read; and how reading affects individuals, social groups, and social institutions” allowed a combination of a humanist’s interest in the betterment of society and the empiricist’s improve understanding of the formation and expansion of knowledge by individuals.&lt;ref&gt;Susan E. Israel and E. Jennifer Monaghan, ed., ''Shaping the Reading Field: The Impact of Early Reading Pioneers, Scientific Research, and Progressive Ideas'' (Newark, DE: International Reading Association, 2007), 257&lt;/ref&gt;

Another significant consideration for Waples was the social enterprise of libraries. He emphasized scholarship, management, professionalism, organization, and research. ''Investigating Library Problems'' (1939), another in the Studies in Library Science series, was a seminal work for the field of library and information studies because it, too, emphasized methodology and integrated quantitative research and introduced consideration of social epistemology. Here Waples went further and proposed that the methodologies and research outcomes were not as significant as the gathering of evidence on which decisions could be based in library environments.&lt;ref&gt;Charles Osburn, “Collection Management in the Library Quarterly, 1931-2005,” ''The Library Quarterly'' 76, no. 1 (January 2006): 42&lt;/ref&gt;

In August 1941 the Graduate Library School of University of Chicago presented a conference on mass communications and American democracy. Waples reported on the 14 papers addressing the issues pertinent just before declaration of war.&lt;ref&gt; Douglas Waples (1941) [https://www.jstor.org/stable/2745137 Press, Radio and Film in the National Emergency, some papers on current research], [[Public Opinion Quarterly]] 5(3):463–9 (via JSTOR)&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1942 Waples joined the U.S. and traveled throughout Europe. In 1947 he and Eleanor Waples divorced, and, in the same year, he then married Dorothy Blake. He returned to the University of Chicago in 1948 but departed the Graduate Library School in 1950 to join the interdisciplinary Committee in Communication. In 1957 he retired from his academic post and retired in Washington Island, Wisconsin.&lt;ref name="Wiegand1990"/&gt;{{rp|150}}  In October 1960, a debilitating stroke affected his mobility and speech permanently, and, although he effected a partial recovery, personal communications revealed that his quality of life was affected dramatically.&lt;ref&gt;Susan E. Israel and E. Jennifer Monaghan, ed., ''Shaping the Reading Field: The Impact of Early Reading Pioneers, Scientific Research, and Progressive Ideas'' (Newark, DE: International Reading Association, 2007), 256&lt;/ref&gt;  He died in 1978.

== Social Epistemology Foundation ==

A modern view finds libraries as places where information is transferred, where reading materials are supplied to users, and where communities are constructed.&lt;ref&gt;Wayne Wiegand, “Broadening Our Perspectives,” ''The Library Quarterly'' 73, no. 1 (January 2003): vi&lt;/ref&gt;  Similarly, Waples presented knowledge as interdisciplinary and social in all aspects of his revolutionary perspective of library studies. The most productive era of investigation and writing was in the 1930s, when scholars like Waples interjected social science research methodology. Focus on technical skills was forced to the background, and, with funding from donors like the Carnegie Foundation, advanced research and education in librarianship as well as emphasis on interdisciplinary approaches to other professions and academic disciplines altered scholarly and professional perspective.&lt;ref&gt;Susan E. Israel and E. Jennifer Monaghan, ed. ''Shaping the Reading Field: The Impact of Early Reading Pioneers, Scientific Research, and Progressive Ideas'' (Newark, DE: International Reading Association, 2007), 248&lt;/ref&gt;  Increased attention was directed to reading behavior, and the Graduate Library School at the University of Chicago became the hub of the developing interest in the study of reading at the time when the Chicago School of Sociology was developing under the influences of significant philosophers like [[John Dewey]], [[George Herbert Mead]], and [[Frederic Thrasher]].

Those who collaborated with Waples, his peers and his graduate students, helped develop the sociological outlook from which scholars assumed a stance of social scientists and gathered statistics about reading materials and related locations frequented by the public. In 1953 Jesse Shera echoed these sentiments in a published paper: “Librarianship is becoming a cluster of inter-dependent specialisms within a scholarship that is unitary and all persuasive, and that it is supported by a body of professional knowledge.” &lt;ref&gt;Jesse Shera, “Emergence of a New Institutional Structure for the Dissemination of Specialized Information,” ''American Documentation'' (pre 1986) 4, no. 4 (Fall 1953): 167&lt;/ref&gt;

== University of Chicago Graduate Library School Records ==

University of Chicago Press records (1892-1965) are held at the University of Chicago Library Special Collections Research Center, including meeting minutes and faculty files, restricted until 2009, and scholarly publications, restricted until 2029. Files on monographs comprise the largest part of the collection. The following Waples publications are included:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
''Classroom Procedure Test in English Composition'' (1928),
''Classroom Procedure Test in Natural Science'' (1928),
''Problem Exercises for High-School Teachers'' (1928),
''The Commonwealth Teacher-Training Study'' (1929),
''What People Want to Read About'' (1931),
''The Library'' (1936),
''National Libraries and Foreign Scholarship'' (1936),
''People and Print'' (1937),
''Investigating Library Problems'' (1939),
''Libraries and Readers in the State of New York'' (1939),
''What Reading Does to People'' (1940), and
''Print, Radio, and Film in a Democracy'' (1942).
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Many of Waples’s papers from his tenure at the Graduate Library School were destroyed in a fire in 1961 at his Bel Air, California, home. The remaining papers held outside University of Chicago Library Special Collections Research Center are in the possession of Mrs. Dorothy Waples and the Graduate Library School.&lt;ref name="Wiegand1990"/&gt;{{rp|151}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8117">The '''English Longitudinal Study of Ageing''' (ELSA) is a [[longitudinal study]] that collects multidisciplinary data from a representative sample of the English population aged 50 and older. The study started in 2002 and there are currently 7 waves of completed data and an eighth wave is currently being collected. The survey data are designed to be used for the investigation of a broad set of topics relevant to understanding the ageing process. Both objective and subjective data are collected covering themes such as health trajectories, disability and healthy life expectancy, the determinants of economic position in older age; the links between economic position, physical health, cognition and mental health; the nature and timing of retirement and post-retirement, labour market activity; household and family structure, social networks and social supports; patterns, determinants and consequences of social, civic and cultural participation and predictors of well-being.  ELSA is led by Professor Andrew Steptoe and is jointly run by teams at [[University College London]] (UCL), the [[Institute for Fiscal Studies]] (IFS), [http://www.natcen.ac.uk/ National Centre for Social Research] and the [[University of Manchester]].

==Funding==
Current funding for ELSA continues until 2020. ELSA is funded jointly by the [[National Institute on Aging]] in the US and a consortium of UK government departments coordinated by the [[Economic and Social Research Council]]. For the current grant, covering waves 7, 8, and 9, the departments making up the UK government funding consortium are: [[Department of Health]]; [[Department for Work and Pensions]]; [[Department for Transport]].

==Study design and data collection==
The first wave of ELSA achieved a sample comprising 11,050 respondents aged 50 and over on 1 March 2002. Sample members are drawn from respondents to the [[Health Survey For England]] (HSE) and the initial data collected for that survey are subsequently linked to the ongoing ELSA measurements. For waves 3, 4, 6 and 7 refreshment samples selected from HSE 2001–04; 2006; 2009-2011; and 2011-2012 were added, respectively. The main interview takes the form of a personal interview using CAPI (computer-assisted personal interview) followed by a short self-completion questionnaire. Other components of the study include: a nurse visit involving measurements of physical function, anthropometric measurements and blood/saliva samples; a life-history interview collecting information on lifetime family circumstances, place of residence, employment and major health events prior to the baseline interview; and an end of life interview, initially adapted from US [[Health and Retirement Study]] (HRS), carried out by close friends/relatives of an eligible ELSA respondent who has died to collect information about the respondent’s circumstances in the period since the final interview and their death.

Over the course of the study to date, the following data have been collected:
* March 2002 - March 2003: Wave 1 Interview
* June 2004 - June 2005: Wave 2 Interview + Nurse visit
* May 2006 - August 2007: Wave 3 Interview
* March 2007 – October 2007: Life-history interview
* May 2008 - June 2009: Wave 4 Interview + Nurse visit
* June 2010 - June 2011: Wave 5 Interview
* May 2012 - June 2013: Wave 6 Interview + Nurse visit
* June 2014 - June 2015: Wave 7 Interview
* May 2016 - June 2017: Wave 8 Interview + Nurse visit
* Expected to start in September 2017 - Health Cognitive Ageing Project substudy

==Data and findings==
Users registered with the [[Economic and Social Data Service]] (ESDS) can access the ELSA datasets via a web-based download service. A list of publications using ELSA data is maintained on the [http://www.ifs.org.uk/elsa/ ELSA website].  A selection of descriptive findings from each wave of the study are published every 2 years&lt;ref&gt;Marmot M, Banks J, Blundell R, Lessof C and Nazroo J (2003), Health, Wealth and Lifestyles of the Older Population in England: The 2002 English Longitudinal Study of Ageing (Wave 1), IFS, London&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Banks J, Breeze E, Lessof C and Nazroo J (2006), Retirement, Health and Relationships of the Older Population in England: The 2004 English Longitudinal Study of Ageing (Wave 2), IFS, London&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Banks J, Breeze E, Lessof C and Nazroo J (2008), Living in the 21st Century: Older People in England: The 2006 English Longitudinal Study of Ageing (Wave 3), IFS, London&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Banks J, Lessof C, Nazroo J, Rogers N, Stafford M and Steptoe A (2010), Financial Circumstances, Health and Well-Being of the Older Population in England: The 2008 English Longitudinal Study of Ageing (Wave 4), IFS, London&lt;/ref&gt;

==ELSA GWAS data==

ELSA possess both genome-wide genotyping data as well as a large array of phenotypic data. The inclusion of such information in ELSA has great potential to augment what is already known about how genomic variation is linked to disease risk and how certain characteristics interact to modify genetic susceptibility. In 2013/2014, the Illumina Omni 2.5–8 chip (Illumina Inc, San Diego, Ca., 560
USA) was used to perform genome-wide genotyping of around 2.5 million single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and related genomic features for approximately 7,400 ELSA participants. The same genotyping chip had previously been used in HRS, enabling direct comparisons of the ELSA and HRS samples to be carried out without the need for imputation-based meta-analysis. The ELSA GWAS data have been deposited in the European Genome-phenome Archive (EGA) and are available to bona fide researchers. Data access is regulated by the Managing Ethico-social, Technical and Administrative issues in Data Access [[METADAC]] committee.

==Related studies==
ELSA data is designed to be directly comparable with data from the US [[Health and Retirement Study]] (HRS) and the [[Survey of Health, Ageing and Retirement in Europe]] (SHARE).  There are a number of other analogous studies around the world that are concerned with aspects of ageing:

==Health differences between England and the USA==
ELSA and HRS data were used to directly compare measures of health, income, and education amongst 55- to 64-year-olds in England and the US.&lt;ref&gt;Banks, J., M. Marmot, Z. Oldfield and J.Smith (2006), Disease and disadvantage in the United States and in England, Journal of the American Medical Association, Vol. 295, No. 17 (May); 2037-2045&lt;/ref&gt; The rates of disease (specifically heart disease, diabetes and cancer) across income groups (low, middle and high income) were significantly higher in the US than England. Differences were found not to be due to measurement or study design, risk factors such as current levels of obesity, drinking and smoking, (which were controlled for) did not explain very much of the international differences. Biomarker data confirmed that these differences in disease were real and not a result of differential reporting behaviour across countries.

'''Erskine College''' is a private [[Christian]] college in [[Due West, South Carolina]]. It offers an undergraduate [[liberal arts college]] and a graduate [[theological seminary]]. The college was founded in 1839 by the [[Associate Reformed Presbyterian Church]], and its sports teams compete in [[NCAA Division II]] as a member of [[Conference Carolinas]].

==History==
Established in 1839 by the Associate Reformed Synod of the South as an academy for men, the college became the first four-year, church-related college in South Carolina{{citation needed|date=November 2014}} It was named for [[Ebenezer Erskine]], one of the founders of one of the antecedent bodies of the Associate Reformed Presbyterian Church and a [[pastor]]. Erskine had led a group of separatists from the [[Church of Scotland]] to found an Associate [[Presbytery (church polity)|Presbytery]]. 

Erskine began to admit women in 1894 and officially became [[coeducational]] in 1899. In 1927, it merged with [[Women's College of Due West]], founded in 1859. In 1929, [[Bryson College]] closed and merged with Erskine College.&lt;ref name="Bryson historical marker"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hmdb.org/marker.asp?marker=14782|title=Bryson College Memorial|accessdate=2010-06-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Sandlapper"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.erskine.edu/news_archive/news/sandlapper.6.8.01.html|title=Erskine College: Hard To Find, Harder To Leave|accessdate=2010-07-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The Flying Fleet==
Back in 1896, Erskine College began its first American football team. They had very successful seasons between 1917 and 1921. During those seasons they have wins against Wofford, Presbyterian, South Carolina, Clemson, and the Citadel. One of the memorable games of Erskine's football team was against Furman University. It was during that game in 1929 that Erskine took on the name "The Flying Fleet". They were given that name by a Greenville reporter who was blown away by their passing performance in that game. On October 18, 1948 when they defeated Florida State 14-6. It was only a couple more years until the Flying Fleet ended their football program in 1951.

==History==

In 1892, José Francisco da Rocha Pombo, an intellectual of the state of Paraná would have initiated the construction of the University, but his project was frustrated by the Federalist Movement.

Twenty years later, Paraná had a reduced number of intellectuals (nine doctors and four engineers), but it was in true development because of the production of the [[yerba mate]].

Moreover, at this time, the [[Contestado War]] appeared as an incentive to the efforts of political leaderships concerning the creation of a university. In this context, [[Victor Ferreira do Amaral]], deputy and director of public instruction of Paraná, started the effective creation of the University.

On December 19, 1912 the University was established and, in 1913, it has initiated its activities as a private institution in an old building situated on Comendador Araújo street. The first courses offered were [[Law|Juridical and Social Sciences]], Engineering, [[Medicine|Medicine and Surgery]], Commerce, [[Dentistry]], [[Pharmacy|Pharmacy and Obstetrics]]. After the establishment of the University, Victor Ferreira do Amaral, who was also its first president, initiated the construction of a central building in a land donated by the municipal government.

Due to the economic recession caused by the World War I, difficulties started to appear. In 1920, a federal law determined the closing of all universities. In a contradictory measure, the federal government created the ''Universidade do Rio de Janeiro'', currently ''[[Universidade Federal do Rio de Janeiro]]'' (Federal University of Rio de Janeiro). The alternative to this law was to split the UFPR in several colleges.

Throughout several years, efforts in order to restore the university took place. Only in the beginning of the fifties the colleges were reunited once again in the University of Paraná, its federalization happening just after that, in 1951, when the university became a public and free-of-charge institution.

After its federalization, a process of expansion began with the construction of the Clinic's Hospital ('''[[Portuguese language|Portuguese]]:''' ''Hospital de Clínicas da Universidade Federal do Paraná'') in 1953, the ''Reitoria'' Campus in 1958 and the Polytechnic Center in 1961. The Polytechnic Center campus occupies {{convert|617,128|m2|ft2}}.&lt;ref name="t"/&gt;

[[File:Pedra fundamental do prédio ufpr.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Foundation stone inauguration]]

==Historical Building==
[[Image:Universidade Federal do Parana 4 Curitiba Parana.jpg|200px|right|thumb|UFPR – ''Historic building at Santos Andrade Square, in Curitiba'']]
The construction placed in the Santos Andrade Square began to be built in 1913, being a project of the military engineer Baeta de Faria. Its inauguration occurred in 1915.

Seven years later, in 1923, two lateral parts were added, according to the original project. The building of the right sector was ended in 1925 and was designated to the Engineering graduation course. In the following year, the left sector had been finalized and it passed to serve the Dentistry course. Other additions were made to the right side of the building and it has received in its totality new paint in 1940. The building was extended towards XV de Novembro Street and, in 1952, new works in the right section led to the demolition of part of the lateral façade built in 1940.

In 1954, the building occupied a whole block between the Santos Andrade Square, XV de Novembro Street, Presidente Faria Street and Alfredo Bufren Lane. The last modifications were made: a new façade with several columns and a wide set of staircases were projected and the covered dome was eliminated. The inauguration of the neoclassical, 17,000 square meter building, took place in 1955.

In the year on 1999, the mayor of Curitiba signed a law that made this building the official symbol of the city.

===Technical High School===

Besides the above-mentioned courses, it offers high school education through its Technical High School. [http://www.et.ufpr.br/]

==Admissions==

Students are admitted by an entrance exam, known as the [[vestibular]], which consists of two parts:

*'''Part I''' is composed of 80 multiple-choice questions including nine questions of each of the following subjects: Portuguese, Literature, Chemistry, Mathematics, Physics, Geography, History and Biology, plus eight questions of a foreign language which can be chosen from English, French, Spanish, German or Italian.

Over 50,000 people apply every year and sit for exactly the same exam. After two weeks time or so, 15,000 are called to take the Part II (or Phase II) written exams.

*'''Part II''' is composed of a Portuguese test which covers five (previously seven) compulsory writing essays. Certain courses require that the candidate take an additional one or two exams involving open-questions in Chemistry, Mathematics, Physics, Geography, History, Biology, Philosophy or [[Sociology]], the specific exam choice being determined by correlation between the subject and each major course. Engineering candidates, for example, take Mathematics and Physics tests.

The wait for the results of Part II is much longer and the results may take something between 4 and 7 weeks. A list with all the admitted candidates comes out usually in the middle of January—on the same day as the ''Mud-bath Party'' sponsored by the Central Directory of Students ('''[[Portuguese language|Portuguese]]:''' Diretório Central dos Estudantes, DCE) occurs.

'''HAL''' ('''Hardware Abstraction Layer''' or rather '''Hardware Annotation Library''') is a [[software]] subsystem for [[Unix-like|UNIX-like]] operating systems providing [[hardware abstraction]].

HAL is now [[deprecation|deprecated]] on most Linux distributions and on FreeBSD. Functionality is being merged into [[udev]] on Linux as of 2008–2010 and devd on FreeBSD.{{fact|date=November 2017}} Previously, HAL was built on top of udev.{{fact|date=November 2017}}

Some other OS-es which don't have an alternative like udev or devd, still use HAL.

The purpose of the hardware abstraction layer was to allow [[desktop application]]s to discover and use the [[computer hardware|hardware]] of the host system through a simple, [[Software portability|portable]] and [[abstraction (computer science)|abstract]] [[API]], regardless of the type of the underlying hardware.&lt;ref name="pennington"&gt;{{citation
| title = Making Hardware Just Work
| first = Havoc
| last = Pennington
| date = 2003-07-10
| url = http://ometer.com/hardware.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

HAL for Linux OS was originally envisioned by [[Havoc Pennington]]. It became a [[freedesktop.org]] project, and was a key part of the software stack of the [[GNOME]] and [[KDE]] [[desktop environment]]s.  It is [[free software]], dual-licensed under both the [[GNU General Public License]] and the [[Academic Free License]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation
| url = https://cgit.freedesktop.org/hal/tree/COPYING
| title = HAL source code license text
| quote = HAL is licensed to you under your choice of the Academic Free License version 2.1, or the GNU General Public License version 2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

HAL is unrelated to the concept of [[Windows NT]] kernel HALs, which handle some platform-specific core functionality within the kernel, such as interrupt routing.

== Rationale ==

Traditionally, the [[operating system]] [[Kernel (computer science)|kernel]] was responsible for providing an abstract interface to the hardware the system ran on. Applications used the [[system call]] interface, or performed file [[input/output|I/O]] on [[device node]]s in order to communicate with hardware through these abstractions.  This sufficed for the simple hardware of early desktop computing.

Computer hardware, however, has increased in complexity and the abstractions provided by Unix kernels have not kept pace with the proliferating number of device and [[peripheral]] types now common on both server and desktop computers.  Most modern [[computer bus|buses]] have also become [[hotplug]]-capable and can have non-trivial [[network topology|topologies]].  As a result, devices are discovered or change state in ways which can be difficult to track through the system call interface or Unix IPC.  The complexity of doing so forces application authors to re-implement hardware support logic.&lt;ref name="pennington" /&gt;

Some devices also require privileged helper programs to prepare them for use.  These must often be invoked in ways that can be awkward to express with the Unix permissions model (for example, allowing users to join [[wireless network]]s only if they are logged into the video console).&lt;ref name="pennington" /&gt;  Application authors resort to using [[setuid]] binaries or run service [[Daemon (computer software)|daemon]]s to provide their own access control and privilege separation, potentially introducing security holes each time.

== Design ==

HAL is a single daemon responsible for discovering, enumerating and mediating access to most of the hardware on the host computer.  Applications communicate with HAL through the [[D-Bus]] [[inter-process communication|IPC]] mechanism, which abstracts the hardware behind an [[object-based]] [[remote procedure call|RPC]] mechanism.

Each logical hardware ''device'' is represented as a D-Bus object, and its bus address is used as a unique identifier.  Devices include abstractions like [[disk partition]]s and visible wireless networks. The device's functionality is exposed through D-Bus ''interfaces'', and its state accessed through ''properties'', a set of key-value pairs.

HAL broadcasts hardware events as ''signals'' on these objects; applications can listen for signals and react to the hardware events that they signify — events such as a [[digital camera]] being plugged in, an [[optical disc]] spinning up or a laptop computer  closing its lid.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation

== Implementations and obsolescence ==

On Linux, HAL uses &lt;code&gt;[[Sysfs|/sys]]&lt;/code&gt; (a [[virtual file system]] for [[Linux]] systems) to discover hardware and listen for kernel [[hotplugging|hotplug]] events.  Some Linux distributions also provide a [[udev]] rule to allow the udev daemon to notify HAL whenever new device nodes appear.

Initially a new daemon [[DeviceKit]] was planned to replace certain aspects of HAL, but in March 2009, DeviceKit was deprecated in favor of adding the same code to udev as a package: &lt;tt&gt;udev-extras&lt;/tt&gt;, and some functions have now moved to &lt;tt&gt;udev&lt;/tt&gt; proper.

'''Sunstroke plants''' or '''heliophytes'''  are adapted to a [[habitat]] with a very intensive [[Solar irradiance|insolation]], because of the construction of its own structure and maintenance ([[metabolism]]). Solar plants, for example, are [[mullein]], [[Calluna|ling]], [[thyme]] and [[Cirsium oleraceum|soft velcro]], [[white clover]], and most [[rose]]s. They are common in open terrain, rocks, [[meadows]], as well as at the mountain [[pasture]]s and [[grassland]]s and other long sunny exposures.&lt;ref name="Sofradzija"&gt;{{cite book|author=Sofradžija A., Šoljan D., Hadžiselimović R. |year= 2004|title= Biologija 1.|publisher= Svjetlost, Sarajevo|isbn=9958-10-686-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Međedović"&gt;{{cite book|author=Međedović S., Maslić E., Hadžiselimović R.|year=2002|title=Biologija 2. |publisher=Svjetlost, Sarajevo|isbn=9958-10-222-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Special features of the plant include coarse tiny [[leaf|leaves]] with hairy and [[wax]]y protection against excessive light radiation and water loss. In structure, the leaves vary in frequent double [[palisade tissue|palisade layers]]. [[Chloroplast]]s have a protective element such as [[carotenoid]] and the [[enzyme]]s, and accumulation of [[reactive oxygen|ROS]] to avoid toxic effects. In addition, there are also [[stoma | stoma tal apparatus]] on the leaves and green [[shoot]]s, in order to allow a better exchange of gases. At same time, this increases possibilities for [[photosynthesis]].&lt;ref name="Walter"&gt;{{cite book|last=Walter S Judd|first=Walter S.|first2=Christopher S. |last2=Campbell |first3=Elizabeth A. |last3=Kellogg |first4=Peter F. |last4=Stevens |first5=Michael J. |last5=Donoghue|title=Plant systematics: a phylogenetic approach.

Unlike the shadow-preferring plants, heliophytes have a high [[light compensation point]], and for this they need a higher illumination intensity for effective adoption of [[carbon dioxide]]. Sunstroke leaves, in this respect, has a very high capacity, to
&lt;br&gt;&lt;math&gt;30\mu molCO_2/m^2s&lt;/math&gt;.

However, they have a higher [[basal metabolism]] comparing  to the other leaves.

[[File:Humanzoogermany.jpg|upright|thumb|400px|An ad for a "Peoples Show" (''Völkerschau'') in [[Stuttgart]] (Germany), 1928]]
'''Human zoos''', also called '''ethnological expositions''', were 19th-, 20th-, and 21st-century public exhibitions of humans, usually in a so-called natural or primitive state. The displays often emphasized the cultural differences between Europeans of [[Western world|Western civilization]] and non-European peoples or with other Europeans who practiced a lifestyle deemed more primitive. Some of them placed [[Indigenous peoples|indigenous]] populations in a continuum somewhere between the [[great ape]]s and Europeans. Ethnological expositions have been extensively criticized and ascertained as highly degrading and [[Racism|racist]], depending on the show and individuals involved.

== Human zoos in Germany ==

{{refimprove section|date=June 2018}}
In the late 19th century German ethnographic museums&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Objects of Culture Ethnology and Ethnographic Museums in Imperial Germany|last=H. Glenn|first=Penny|publisher=University of North Carolina Press|year=2002|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; were an attempt at empirical study of human culture. They contained artifacts from cultures around the world organized by continent allowing visitors to see the similarities and differences between the groups and form their own ideas. The ethnographic museums of Germany were explicitly designed to steer away from projecting certain principles or instructing its viewers to interpret the material in a particular manner. They were instead left open for museum guests to form their own opinions.

The directors of Germany's ethnographic museums intended to create a unifying history of mankind,&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; to show how humans had progressed to the cosmopolitan creatures that walked the halls of these museums. Imperialism influenced the supporters, visitors, and collectors of these museums, the displays, directions, and political rhetoric.

Ethnology studies in Germany took a new approach in the 1870s as human displays were incorporated into zoos. These exhibits were lauded as educational to the general population by the scientific community of the time, because they were informing of the way people lived across the world. Very quickly the exhibits were used as a way to show that Europeans had evolved into a superior cosmopolitan life.

As Ethnogenic expositions were discontinued in Germany around 1931,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dw.com/en/human-zoos-when-people-were-the-exhibits/a-37748193 Ethnogenic expositions were discontinued in Germany around 1931]&lt;/ref&gt; there were many repercussions for the performers. Many of the people brought from their homelands to work in the exhibits had created families in Germany, and there were many children that had been born in Germany. Once they no longer worked in the zoos or for performance acts these people were stuck living in Germany where they had no rights and were harshly discriminated against. During the rise of the Nazi party the foreign actors in these stage shows were typically able to stay out of concentration camps because there were so few of them that the Nazis did not see them as a real threat.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;“‘You Better Go Back to Africa’| Interview.” ''"You Better Go Back to Africa"| Interview'', DW English, 18 June 2017, www.youtube.com/watch?v=baGXUsOKBcU.&lt;/ref&gt; Although they were able to avoid concentration camps, they were not able to participate in German life as citizens of ethnically German origin could. The [[Hitler Youth]] did not allow children of foreign parents to participate, and adults were rejected as German soldiers.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Many ended up working in war industry factories or foreign laborer camps.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; After [[World War II|WWII]] ended, racism in Germany became more concealed or invisible but did not go away. Many people of foreign descent intended to leave after the war, but because of their German nationality, it was difficult for them to emigrate.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

=== Key influences ===
[[Carl Hagenbeck]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Savages and Beasts: The Birth of the Modern Zoo|last=Rothfels|first=Nigel|publisher=Johns Hopkins University Press|year=2012|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; was a German exotic animal businessman, who became famous for his conquering of the animal trade market during the mid to late 1800’s. Due to the costs of acquiring and keeping animals, the financial implications started to worry Hagenbeck, and he began looking for other ways to alleviate the company’s monetary strains. [[Heinrich Leutemann]], an old friend of Hagenbeck suggested bringing along the people from the foreign lands to accompany the animals. The idea struck Hagenbeck as brilliant and he had a group of [[Sami people|Laplander]]s accompany his next shipment of Reindeer. They set up traditional houses and went about their business as usual on the Hagenbeck property. The display was so successful that Carl was organizing his second show before the first was over. Although the concept of parading peoples captured from conquered lands goes back to the Romans, Hagenbeck claimed to have the first show’s displaying “cultures” from foreign lands. Carl Hagenbeck continued to bring indigenous people along with the animals he was importing from across the globe. The people would come with their hunting equipment, homes, and other facets of their daily life. Hagenbeck’s displays evolved in complexity as the years went by. In 1876 Hagenbeck had a group of 6 [[Sami people|Sami]] accompany a herd of reindeer, and by 1874 his acts included close to 67 men, women, and children in his ''Ceylon'' show performing with 25 elephants. The performances also expanded from showing every day activities such as milking reindeer and building huts, to displaying some of the more extravagant parts of the cultures such as magicians, jugglers, and devil dancers.

The notion of the human curiosity has a history at least as long as [[History of colonialism|colonialism]]. For instance, in the [[Western Hemisphere]], one of the earliest-known [[zoo]]s, that of [[Moctezuma II|Moctezuma]] in Mexico, consisted not only of a vast collection of animals, but also exhibited humans, for example, dwarves, albinos and hunchbacks.&lt;ref&gt;Mullan, Bob and Marvin Garry, ''Zoo culture: The book about watching people watch animals'', [[University of Illinois Press]], [[Urbana, Illinois]], Second edition, 1998, p.32. {{ISBN|0-252-06762-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the [[Renaissance]], the [[Medici]] developed a large [[menagerie]] in the Vatican.
In the 16th century, Cardinal [[Ippolito de' Medici|Hippolytus Medici]] had a collection of people of different races as well as exotic animals.
He is reported as having a troupe of so-called Savages, speaking over twenty languages; there were also Moors, Tartars, Indians, Turks and Africans.&lt;ref&gt;Mullan, Bob and Marvin Garry, ''Zoo culture: The book about watching people watch animals'', [[University of Illinois Press]], [[Urbana, Illinois]], Second edition, 1998, p.98. {{ISBN|0-252-06762-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Maximo and Bartola CDV by Edmonds of Southampton, c1867.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Maximo and Bartola, c. 1867]] One of the first modern public human exhibitions was [[P. T. Barnum|P.T. Barnum]]'s exhibition of [[Joice Heth]] on February 25, 1835&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.museumofhoaxes.com/joiceheth.html|title=The Museum of Hoaxes|work=Museum of Hoaxes|accessdate=11 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and, subsequently, the [[Conjoined twins|Siamese twins]] [[Chang and Eng Bunker]]. These exhibitions were common in [[freak show]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://migs.concordia.ca/occpapers/zoo.htm "On A Neglected Aspect Of Western Racism"] by Kurt Jonassohn, December 2000, Montreal Institute for Genocide and Human Rights Studies&lt;/ref&gt; Another famous example was that of [[Saartjie Baartman]] of the [[Nama people|Namaqua]], often referred to as the Hottentot Venus, who was displayed in London and France until her death in 1815.

During the 1850s, [[Maximo and Bartola]], two [[microcephalic]] children from El Salvador, were exhibited in the US and Europe under the names Aztec Children and Aztec Lilliputians.&lt;ref&gt;[[Roberto Aguirre]], ''Informal Empire: Mexico And Central America In Victorian Culture'', Univ. of Minnesota Press, 2004, ch. 4&lt;/ref&gt;  However, human zoos would become common only in the 1870s in the midst of the [[New Imperialism]] period.

== 1870s to the 1930s ==

In the 1870s, exhibitions of exotic populations became popular in various countries. Human zoos could be found in [[Paris]], [[Hamburg]], [[Antwerp]], [[Barcelona]], [[London]], [[Milan]], and [[New York City]]. [[Carl Hagenbeck]], a merchant in wild animals and future entrepreneur of many zoos in Europe, decided in 1874 to exhibit [[Samoans|Samoan]] and [[Sami people]] as "purely natural" populations. In 1876, he sent a collaborator to the Egyptian [[Sudan]] to bring back some wild beasts and [[Nubians]]. The Nubian exhibit was very successful in Europe and toured Paris, London, and [[Berlin]]. In 1880, Hagenbeck dispatched an agent to Labrador to secure a number of Esquimaux (Eskimo / [[Inuit]]) from the moravian mission of Hebron; these Inuit were exhibited in his [[Hamburg Tierpark]]. Other ethnological expositions included Egyptian and Bedouin mock settlements.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Belvedere: Zeitschrift für bildende Kunst, Volume 12|date=2006|publisher=Österreichische Galerie Belvedere|page=102|url=https://www.google.com/books?id=nChMAQAAIAAJ|accessdate=19 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hagenbeck would also employ agents to take part in his ethnological exhibits, with the aim of exposing his audience to various different subsistence modes and lifestyles. Among these hired workers were Hersi Egeh and his lineage from Berbera in present-day northwestern Somalia, who in the process accumulated much wealth, which they later reinvested in real estate in their homeland.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Africana Publishing Company|journal=The International Journal of African Historical Studies|date=1985|page=20|url=https://www.google.com/books?id=NXgMAQAAMAAJ|accessdate=19 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The viceroy of India likewise gave Hagenbeck permission to hire local inhabitants for an exhibit, on the condition that Hagenbeck would first have to deposit funds into the royal treasury.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Davis|first1=Janet M.|title=The Circus Age: Culture and Society under the American Big Top|date=2003|publisher=University of North Carolina Press|isbn=0807861499|page=198|url=https://www.google.com/books?id=FDzqCQAAQBAJ|accessdate=19 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Albert Geoffroy Saint-Hilaire|Geoffroy de Saint-Hilaire]], director of the [[Jardin d'acclimatation]], decided in 1877 to organize two ethnological spectacles that presented Nubians and [[Inuit]]. That year, the audience of the Jardin d'acclimatation' doubled to one million. Between 1877 and 1912, approximately thirty ethnological exhibitions were presented at the ''Jardin zoologique d'acclimatation''.

Both the [[Exposition Universelle (1878)|1878]] and the [[Exposition Universelle (1889)|1889 Parisian World's Fair]] presented a Negro Village (''village nègre''). Visited by 28 million people, the 1889 World's Fair displayed 400 indigenous people as the major attraction. The 1900 World's Fair presented the famous [[diorama]] living in [[Madagascar]], while the [[Colonial exhibition|Colonial Exhibitions]] in [[Marseille]]s (1906 and 1922) and in Paris (1907 and 1931) also displayed humans in cages, often nude or semi-nude. The [[Paris Colonial Exposition|1931 exhibition in Paris]] was so successful that 34 million people attended it in six months, while a smaller counter-exhibition entitled ''The Truth on the Colonies'', organized by the [[French Communist Party|Communist Party]], attracted very few visitors—in the first room, it recalled [[Albert Londres]] and [[André Gide]]'s critiques of [[unfree labour|forced labour]] in the colonies. Nomadic [[Senegal|Senegalese Villages]] were also presented.

In 1883, native people of [[Suriname]] were displayed in the [[Internationale Koloniale en Uitvoerhandel Tentoonstelling|International Colonial and Export Exhibition]] in Amsterdam, held behind the [[Rijksmuseum]].

In the late 1800s, Hagenbeck organized exhibitions of indigenous populations from various parts of the globe. He staged a public display in 1886 of [[Sinhalese people|Sinhalese]] autochthones from the [[Sri Lanka]]. In 1893/1894, he also put together an exhibition of [[Sami people|Sami]]/Lapps in [[Hamburg]]-Saint Paul.

At the 1901 [[Pan-American Exposition]]&lt;ref&gt;See [[Charles Dudley Arnold]]'s [http://www.pdphotoblog.com/category/native-american photo] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080705021556/http://www.pdphotoblog.com/category/native-american |date=2008-07-05 }} similar human displays had been seen of six men dressed in Native-American costume, in front and on top of a reconstruction of a Six-Nations Long House.&lt;/ref&gt; and at the 1893 [[World's Columbian Exposition]], where [[Little Egypt (dancer)|Little Egypt]] performed [[bellydance]], and where the photographers [[Charles Dudley Arnold]] and [[Harlow Higginbotham]] took depreciative photos, presenting indigenous people as catalogue of "types", along with sarcastic legends.&lt;ref&gt;Anne Maxell, "Montrer l'Autre: Franz Boas et les soeurs Gerhard", in ''Zoos humains.

In 1896, to increase the number of visitors, the [[Cincinnati Zoo and Botanical Garden|Cincinnati Zoo]] invited one hundred Sioux Native Americans to establish a village at the site. The Sioux lived at the zoo for three months.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ohiohistorycentral.org/entry.php?rec=685 Cincinnati Zoo and Botanical Garden], Ohio Historical Society.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1904, [[Apache]]s and [[Igorot]]s (from the Philippines) were displayed at the [[Louisiana Purchase Exposition|Saint Louis World Fair]] in association with the [[1904 Summer Olympics]]. The US had just acquired, following the [[Spanish–American War]], new territories such as [[Guam]], the [[Philippines]], and [[Puerto Rico]], allowing them to "display" some of the native inhabitants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Remembering St. Louis, 1904: A World on Display and Bontoc Eulogy|publisher=[[Syracuse University]]|author=Jim Zwick|date=March 4, 1996|accessdate=2007-05-25|url=http://www.lib.berkeley.edu/MRC/Bontoc.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the Rev. [[Sequoyah Ade]]:

&lt;blockquote&gt;To further illustrate the indignities heaped upon the [[Philippines|Philippine]] people following their eventual loss to the Americans, the United States made the Philippine campaign the centrepoint of the 1904 World's Fair held that year in St. Louis, MI [sic]. In what was enthusiastically termed a "parade of evolutionary progress," visitors could inspect the "primitives" that represented the counterbalance to "Civilisation" justifying [[Rudyard Kipling|Kipling]]'s poem "[[The White Man's Burden]]". [[Pygmy|Pygmies]] from New Guinea and Africa, who were later displayed in the Primate section of the [[Bronx Zoo]], were paraded next to American Indians such as Apache warrior [[Geronimo]], who sold his autograph. But the main draw was the Philippine exhibition complete with full size replicas of Indigenous living quarters erected to exhibit the inherent backwardness of the Philippine people. The purpose was to highlight both the "civilising" influence of American rule and the economic potential of the island chains' natural resources on the heels of the [[Philippine–American War]]. It was, reportedly, the largest specific Aboriginal exhibition displayed in the exposition. As one pleased visitor commented, the human zoo exhibition displayed "the race narrative of odd peoples who mark time while the world advances, and of savages made, by American methods, into civilized workers."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=The Passions of Suzie Wong Revisited, by Rev.

In 1906, [[Madison Grant]]—socialite, [[eugenics|eugenicist]], amateur [[anthropology|anthropologist]], and head of the [[New York Zoological Society]]—had [[Congo Pygmies|Congolese pygmy]] [[Ota Benga]] put on display at the Bronx Zoo in New York City alongside [[ape]]s and other animals. At the behest of Grant, the zoo director [[William Temple Hornaday|William Hornaday]] placed Benga displayed in a cage with the chimpanzees, then with an [[orangutan]] named Dohong, and a parrot, and labeled him ''The Missing Link'', suggesting that in [[evolution]]ary terms Africans like Benga were closer to apes than were Europeans. It triggered protests from the city's clergymen, but the public reportedly flocked to see it.&lt;ref name=NYTBenga/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bradford, Phillips Verner and Blume, Harvey. ''Ota Benga: The Pygmy in the Zoo''. St. Martins Press, 1992.&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Friedländer.plakat.8.jpg|thumb|upright|Ad for a [[Carl Hagenbeck]] show (1886)]]

Benga shot targets with a bow and arrow, wove twine, and wrestled with an orangutan. Although, according to ''The New York Times'', "few expressed audible objection to the sight of a human being in a cage with monkeys as companions", controversy erupted as black clergymen in the city took great offense. "Our race, we think, is depressed enough, without exhibiting one of us with the apes", said the Reverend James H. Gordon, superintendent of the Howard Colored Orphan Asylum in Brooklyn. "We think we are worthy of being considered human beings, with souls."&lt;ref name="nytimes"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2006/08/06/nyregion/thecity/06zoo.html?ex=1155009600&amp;en=c2cc9b84edc068cd&amp;ei=5087%0A|title=The Scandal at the Zoo|last=Keller|first=Mitch|date=2006-08-06|work=New York Times|accessdate=2008-07-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Mayor of New York City|New York City Mayor]] [[George B. McClellan Jr.]] refused to meet with the clergymen, drawing the praise of Hornaday, who wrote to him: "When the history of the Zoological Park is written, this incident will form its most amusing passage."&lt;ref name="nytimes" /&gt;

As the controversy continued, Hornaday remained unapologetic, insisting that his only intention was to put on an ethnological exhibition. In another letter, he said that he and Grant—who ten years later would publish the racist tract ''[[The Passing of the Great Race]]''—considered it "imperative that the society should not even seem to be dictated to" by the black clergymen.&lt;ref name="nytimes" /&gt;

On Monday, September 8, 1906, after just two days, Hornaday decided to close the exhibition, and Benga could be found walking the zoo grounds, often followed by a crowd "howling, jeering and yelling."&lt;ref name="nytimes" /&gt;

In 1925, a display at [[Belle Vue Zoo]] in [[Manchester]], England, was entitled "Cannibals" and featured black Africans depicted as savages.&lt;ref&gt;Paul A. Rees, ''An Introduction to Zoo Biology and Management'', [[Wiley-Blackwell]], John Wiley &amp; Sons Ltd., [[Chichester]] ([[West Sussex]]), 2011, p.44. {{ISBN|978-1-4051-9349-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By the 1930s, a new kind of human zoo appeared in America, nude shows masquerading as education. These included the [[Zoro Garden Nudist Colony]] at the Pacific International Exposition in San Diego, California (1935-6) and the Sally Rand Nude Ranch at the [[Golden Gate International Exposition]] in San Francisco (1939). The former was supposedly a real [[nudist colony]], which used hired performers instead of actual nudists. The latter featured nude women performing in western attire. The Golden Gate fair also featured a "Greenwich Village" show, described in the Official Guide Book as “Model artists’ colony and revue theatre.”&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sfmuseum.org/bio/rand.html "Sally Rand and The Music Box", Virtual Museum of San Francisco]&lt;/ref&gt;

Also in 2007, pygmy performers at the Festival of Pan-African Music (Fespam) were housed at a zoo in [[Brazzaville]], [[Republic of the Congo|Congo]].  Although members of the group of twenty people - among them an infant, age three-months - were not officially on display, it was necessary for them to "collect firewood in the zoo to cook their food, and [they] were being stared at and filmed by tourists and passers-by".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/africa/6898241.stm|title=Pygmy artists housed in Congo zoo|author=[[BBC News]]|date=2007-07-13|accessdate=2008-08-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[http://www.idef.com/pdf/Idef4.pdf '' IDEF4 Object-Oriented Design Method Report ''] Version 2.0. Jan 1995.&lt;/ref&gt;

This method is part of the [[IDEF]] family of [[modeling language]]s in the field of [[systems engineering|systems]] and [[software engineering]].

== Overview ==
IDEF4 method is a graphically oriented methodology for the design of object-oriented software systems. The object-oriented programming paradigm provides the developer with an abstract view of his program as composed of a set of state maintaining objects which define the behavior of the program by the protocol of their interactions. An object consists of a set of local state defining attributes and a set of methods (procedures) that define the behavior of that particular object and its relationship to the other objects that make up the system.&lt;ref name="FB89"&gt;Patricia Griffith Friel and Thomas M. Blinn (1989). [https://ntrs.nasa.gov/archive/nasa/casi.ntrs.nasa.gov/19910023489_1991023489.pdf "Automated IDEF3 and IDEF4 Systems Design Specification Document"]. Technical report. NASA Johnson Space Center.&lt;/ref&gt;

The IDEF4 method multi-dimensional approach to object-oriented software system design consists of the following items:&lt;ref name="May95"/&gt;
* Design layers (system-level, application-level, and low-level design),
* Artifact design status (application domain, in transition, software domain),
* Design models (static, dynamic, and behavior) and the [[design rationale]] component, and
* Design features ranging from general to specific enabling deferred [[decision making]].

== History ==
The development of IDEF4 came from the recognition that the modularity, maintainability and code reusability that results from the [[object-oriented programming]] paradigm can be realized in traditional [[data processing]] applications. The proven ability of the object-oriented programming paradigm to support data level integration in large complex [[distributed system]]s is also a major factor in the widespread interest in this technology from the traditional data processing community.&lt;ref name="FB89"/&gt;

IDEF4 was developed as a design tool for software designers who use object-oriented languages such as the [[Common Lisp Object System]], [[Flavors (programming language)|Flavors]], [[Smalltalk]], [[Objective-C]], [[C++]] and others. Since effective usage of the object-oriented paradigm requires a different thought process than used with conventional procedural or [[database language]]s, standard methodologies such as [[structure chart]]s, [[data flow diagram]]s, and traditional [[database model|data design model]]s (hierarchical, relational, and network) are not sufficient. IDEF4 seeks to provide the necessary facilities to support the object-oriented design decision making process.&lt;ref name="FB89"/&gt;

== IDEF4 concepts ==

=== Dimensions of IDEF4 Design Objects ===
[[File:Dimensions of IDEF4 Design Objects.jpg|thumb|240px|Dimensions of IDEF4 Design Objects.]]
IDEF4 uses an object-oriented design method or procedure that is very similar to [[James Rumbaugh|Rumbaugh]]’s Object Method Technique&lt;ref&gt;[[James Rumbaugh]] (1991). ''Object-Oriented Modeling and Design''. Englewood Cliffs, NJ:
Prentice Hall.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Sally Shlaer|Schlaer]]/[[Stephen J. Mellor|Mellor]]’s Object-Oriented Analysis and Design (OOA/OOD) technique.&lt;ref&gt;[[Sally Shlaer]] and [[Stephen J. Mellor]] (1988) ''Object-Oriented Systems Analysis: Modeling The Real World in Data''. Englewood Cliffs, NJ: Prentice Hall.&lt;/ref&gt; However, there are some crucial differences: 
* IDEF4 is specifically designed to be compatible with other IDEF methods,
* IDEF4 allows one to track the status of design artifacts from domain object through transition to design specification, and
* IDEF4 includes a [[design rationale]] component.
These extra dimensions are shown in the figure. The edges of the box show the progression of the design
from start to finish elaborating each of these dimensions.

=== IDEF4 Design Activities ===
In IDEF4, a design starts with the analysis of requirements and takes as input the domain objects. These domain objects are encoded in their equivalent IDEF4 form and marked as domain objects. As computational objects are developed for these objects, they are marked as “transitional” and finally as “completed.” The level of completion of an IDEF4 design is determined by setting measures based on the status, level, and model dimensions of individual artifacts in the design.&lt;ref name="May95"/&gt;
[[File:IIDEF4 Design Activities.jpg|thumb|240px|left|IDEF4 Design Activities.]]
The system-level design starts once the “raw material” (domain) objects have been collected. This develops the design context, ensures connectivity to legacy systems, and identifies the applications that must be built to satisfy the requirements. Static, dynamic, behavioral, and rationale models are built for the objects at the system level. These specifications become the requirements on the application level – the next level of design. The application level design identifies and specifies all of the software components (partitions) needed in the design. Static models, dynamic models, behavioral models, and the rationale component are built for the objects at the application level. These specifications become the requirements on the next level of design – the low-level design. Static Models, Dynamic Models, Behavioral Models, and the [[design rationale]] component are built for the low-level design objects. Sub-layers may be built within each layer to reduce complexity.&lt;ref name="May95"/&gt;

IDEF4 is an iterative procedure involving partitioning, classification/specification, assembly, simulation, and re-partitioning activities, see figure. First the design is partitioned into objects, each of which is either classified against existing objects or for which an external specification is developed. The external specification enables the internal specification of the object to be delegated and performed concurrently. After classification/specification, the interfaces between the objects are specified in the assembly activity (i.e., static, dynamic, and behavioral models detailing different aspects of the interaction between objects are developed). While the models are developed, it is important to simulate use scenarios or cases &lt;ref&gt;[[Ivar Jacobson]] (1994). ''Object-Oriented Software Engineering: A Use Case Driven Approach''. Reading, MA: Addison-Wesley.&lt;/ref&gt; between objects to uncover design flaws. Based on these flaws the designer can then rearrange the existing models and simulate them until the designer is satisfied.&lt;ref name="May95"/&gt;

=== IDEF4 Object-oriented Concepts ===
IDEF4’s defines a set of object oriented concepts:&lt;ref name="May95"/&gt;
* ''Domains'' : IDEF4 projects are implemented in a domain. A domain can be seen as the scope of the system being developed. During system design, the software is transitioned between three domains: the application domain, the design domain, and the implementation domain.
* ''Features, Artifacts, and Objects''
* ''Object Instance'' : Objects can be object instances, object classes, and object partitions. Object instances are the individual things encountered in the application domain.
* ''Classes'' : Classes are generalizations about objects and are used to manage complexity by taking advantage of similarities in object instances and grouping them under a class or category.
* ''Subclass/Superclass'' : The term subclass captures the concept of grouping particular instances of a class into an even more specialized class.
* ''Partitions'' : A partition object contains objects and relations.
* ''Attributes'' : Attributes are an implementation choice on how to represent an object’s state.
* ''Object States'' : Object states represent situations or conditions of an object instance that are meaningful in the design.
* ''Method'' : A method is an implementation of behavior (i.e., a set of instructions according to which the object performs some operation).
* ''Message and Polymorphism'' : Objects communicate by sending messages to each other.
* ''Event'' : An event is a signal generated by a method in an object indicating some condition in the object.
* ''Object Life cycles'' : In any system, objects exhibit patterns of behavior as they cycle through different states.
* ''Client/Server'' : An object plays the role of a client relative to a message if it is the sender of that message.
* ''Relationships and Roles'' : Objects connected together with arcs. These arcs are called relationships and they show associations between objects.
* ''Inheritance'' : A specific type of relationship used in object-oriented technology is inheritance.
* ''Encapsulation and Information Hiding'' : Encapsulation and information hiding are two object-oriented concepts that are most easily understood when discussed in terms of interactions between objects.

=== Object Class Identification ===
[[File:Object classes in IDEF4.jpg|thumb|480px|The five types of Object classes in IDEF4.]]
The IDEF4 Method assumes that the domain objects have been identified through Object-Oriented Domain Analysis. Methods such as [[IDEF1]], [[IDEF5]], [[IDEF3]], [[SA/SD]] can be used to perform domain analysis.&lt;ref&gt;[[Edward Yourdon]], and [[Larry Constantine]] (1979). ''Structured design: Fundamentals of a discipline of computer program and systems design''. Englewood Cliffs, NJ: Prentice-Hall.&lt;/ref&gt; However, IDEF4 practitioners should be aware of how objects are identified, as the design process may reveal deficiencies in the Object-Oriented Analysis. IDEF4 had defined five types of classes:&lt;ref name="May95"/&gt;
* ''Physical Objects''
* ''Role Objects'' : The role may be related to other activities that the person engages in (e.g., a patient in a hospital, a stockholder, a client, a trustee, a suspect in a burglary, or a tax payer).
* ''Event Objects'' : Events or incidents may also be considered objects. The identification of events as objects is highly subjective, and will depend on the domain in which the software is to be used.
* ''Interaction Objects'' : Interaction objects are the result of interactions or transactions between two or more objects.
* ''Specification and Procedure Objects'' : Specification objects describe the acceptable characteristics of objects instances. Procedure objects refer to the way other object instances may interact.

== IDEF4 Building blocks ==
[[File:26 Organization of the IDEF4 Project.jpg|thumb|360px|Organization of the IDEF4 Building blocks.]]

=== IDEF4 Layers ===
IDEF4 users design in three distinct layers:&lt;ref name="May95"/&gt;
# system design,
# application design, and
# low-level design.
This three layered organization reduces the complexity of the design. The system design layer ensures connectivity to other systems in the design context. The application layer depicts the interfaces between the components of the system being designed. These components include commercial applications, previously designed and implemented applications, and applications to be designed. The low-level design layer represents the foundation objects of the system.

=== IDEF4 Artifact Status ===
IDEF4 distinguishes between IDEF4 artifacts newly created from the application domain, artifacts in transition to design specification, and artifacts that have been specified that can be applied to create the design specification. Any design artifact in IDEF4 can be marked as domain, transition, or complete. This allows practitioners and reviewers to track the progress of the design toward completion.&lt;ref name="May95"/&gt;

=== IDEF4 Design Models ===
[[File:Organization of the IDEF4 model.jpg|thumb|360px|Organization of the IDEF4 model.]]
IDEF4 uses three design models and a design rationale component:&lt;ref name="May95"/&gt; 
* The Static Model (SM) defines time-invariant relations between objects (for example, inheritance).
* The Dynamic Model (DM) specifies the communication between objects and the state transitions of objects.
* The Behavior Model (BM) defines the relations between the respective behaviors of objects.
The design rationale component provides a top-down representation of the system, giving a broad view that encompasses the three design models and documents the rationale for major design evolutions.

Each model represents a different cross section of the design. The three design models capture all the information represented in a design project, and the design rationale documents the reasoning behind the design. Each model is supported by a graphical syntax that highlights the design decisions that must be made and their impact on other perspectives of the design. To facilitate use, the graphical syntax is identical among the three models.&lt;ref name="May95"/&gt;

=== Design Features ===
IDEF4 provides a broad range of design features – from generic to specific. This range enables deferred decision making by allowing the designer to first capture design features in general terms and later to refine them. This significantly reduces the burden on designers by allowing them to immediately capture new design concepts with IDEF4 design features, even if these design concepts have not yet been explored in detail.&lt;ref name="May95"/&gt;

Sea ice algal communities are mostly concentrated in the bottom layer of the ice, but can also occur in [[Brine rejection|brine channels]] within the ice, in melt ponds, and on the surface.

Because terrestrial ice algae occur in freshwater systems, the species composition differs greatly from that of sea ice algae. These communities are significant in that they often change the color of glaciers and ice sheets, impacting the [[Albedo|reflectivity]] of the ice itself.

For example, in late winter/early spring, motile diatoms like ''N. frigida'' have been found to dominate the uppermost layers of the ice, as far as briny channels reach, and their abundance is greater in [[multi-year ice]] (MYI) than in [[first year ice]] (FYI). Additionally, dinoflagellates have also been found to dominant in the early austral spring in Antarctic sea ice.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

Sea ice algal communities can also thrive at the surface of the ice, in surface [[melt pond]]s, and in layers where [[Ice-sheet dynamics|rafting]] has occurred. In melt ponds, dominant algal types can vary with pond salinity, with higher concentrations of diatoms being found in melt ponds with higher salinity.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Lee|first=Sang H.|last2=Stockwell|first2=Dean A.|last3=Joo|first3=Hyoung-Min|last4=Son|first4=Young Baek|last5=Kang|first5=Chang-Keun|last6=Whitledge|first6=Terry E.|date=2012-04-01|title=Phytoplankton production from melting ponds on Arctic sea ice|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1029/2011JC007717/abstract|journal=Journal of Geophysical Research: Oceans|language=en|volume=117|issue=C4|pages=C04030|doi=10.1029/2011JC007717|issn=2156-2202|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170317055136/http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1029/2011JC007717/abstract|archivedate=2017-03-17|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Because of their adaption to low light conditions, the presence of ice algae (in particular, vertical position in the ice pack) is primarily limited by nutrient availability. The highest concentrations are found at the base of the ice because the porosity of that ice enables nutrient infiltration from seawater.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/960106363|title=Sea ice|last=1962-|first=Thomas, David N.

To survive in the harsh sea ice environment, organisms must be able to endure extreme variations in salinity, temperature, and solar radiation. Algae living in brine channels can secrete [[osmolyte]]s, such as [[dimethylsulfoniopropionate]] (DMSP), which allows them to survive the high salinities in the  channels after ice formation in the winter, as well as low salinities when the relatively fresh meltwater flushes the channels in the spring and summer.  [[File:Thurber snow.jpg|thumb|Snow at the surface reduces light availability in specific areas and thus the ability of algae to grow]]Some sea ice algae species secrete ice-binding proteins (IBP) as a gelatinous [[extracellular polymeric substance]] (EPS) to protect cell membranes from damage from ice crystal growth and freeze thaw cycles.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Krembs|first=Christopher|last2=Eicken|first2=Hajo|last3=Deming|first3=Jody W.|date=2011-03-01|title=Exopolymer alteration of physical properties of sea ice and implications for ice habitability and biogeochemistry in a warmer Arctic|url=http://www.pnas.org/content/108/9/3653|journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences|language=en|volume=108|issue=9|pages=3653–3658|doi=10.1073/pnas.1100701108|issn=0027-8424|pmc=3048104|pmid=21368216|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151228094427/http://www.pnas.org/content/108/9/3653|archivedate=2015-12-28|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  EPS alters the microstructure of the ice and creates further habitat for future blooms.

=== Role in ecosystem ===
Ice algae play a critical role in [[primary production]] and serve as part of the base of the polar food web by converting carbon dioxide and inorganic nutrients to oxygen and organic matter through photosynthesis in the upper ocean of both the Arctic and Antarctic. Within the Arctic, estimates of the contribution of sea ice algae to total primary production ranges from 3-25%, up to 50-57% in high Arctic regions.&lt;ref name="Kohlbach 2027–2044"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kohlbach|first=Doreen|last2=Graeve|first2=Martin|last3=A.

Ultimately, these organisms are eaten by fish, whales, penguins, and dolphins.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  When sea ice algal communities detach from the sea ice they are consumed by pelagic grazers, such as zooplankton, as they sink through the water column and by [[Benthic zone|benthic]] invertebrates as they settle on the seafloor.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;  Sea ice algae as food are rich in [[Polyunsaturated fatty acid|polyunsaturated]] and other essential fatty acids, and are the exclusive producer of certain essential [[omega-3 fatty acid]]s that are important for [[copepod]] egg production, egg hatching, and zooplankton growth and function.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":7"/&gt; [[Image:Krillicekils.jpg|right|thumb|200px|The undersurface of the [[pack ice]] in Antarctica colored green - [[Antarctic krill]] scraping off the ice algae]]

==== Temporal variation ====
The timing of sea ice algae blooms has a significant impact on the entire ecosystem. Initiation of the bloom is primarily controlled by the return of the sun in the spring (i.e. the solar angle). Because of this, ice [[Algal bloom|algae blooms]] usually occurs before the blooms of pelagic [[phytoplankton]], which require higher light levels and warmer water.&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Leu|first=E.|last2=Søreide|first2=J.

==== Bloom initialization ====
There are several ways in which sea ice algal blooms are thought to start their annual cycle, and hypotheses about these vary depending on water column depth, sea ice age, and taxonomic group. Where sea ice overlays deep ocean, it is proposed that cells trapped in multiyear ice brine pockets are reconnected to the water column below and quickly colonize nearby ice of all ages. This is known as the ''multiyear sea ice repository hypothesis''.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; This seeding source has been demonstrated in diatoms, which dominate [[Sympagic ecology|sympagic]] blooms. Other groups, such as the [[dinoflagellate]]s, which also bloom in the spring/summer, have been shown to maintain low cell numbers in the water column itself, and do not primarily overwinter within the ice.&lt;ref name=":9"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kauko|first=Hanna M.|last2=Olsen|first2=Lasse M.|last3=Duarte|first3=Pedro|last4=Peeken|first4=Ilka|last5=Granskog|first5=Mats A.|last6=Johnsen|first6=Geir|last7=Fernández-Méndez|first7=Mar|last8=Pavlov|first8=Alexey K.|last9=Mundy|first9=Christopher J.|date=2018-06-06|title=Algal Colonization of Young Arctic Sea Ice in Spring|journal=Frontiers in Marine Science|volume=5|doi=10.3389/fmars.2018.00199|issn=2296-7745}}&lt;/ref&gt; Where sea ice covers ocean that is somewhat shallower, resuspension of cells from the sediment may occur.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Johnsen|first=Geir|last2=Hegseth|first2=Else Nøst|date=June 1991|title=Photoadaptation of sea-ice microalgae in the Barents Sea||journal=Polar Biology|volume=11|issue=3|doi=10.1007/bf00240206|issn=0722-4060}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Implications of climate change ===
[[Climate change]] and warming of Arctic and Antarctic regions have the potential to greatly alter ecosystem functioning. Decreasing ice cover in polar regions is expected to lessen the relative proportion of sea ice algae production to measures of annual primary production.&lt;ref&gt;IPCC, 2007: Climate Change 2007: Synthesis Report.

This melting also contributes to [[Stratification (water)|stratification]] of the water column that alters the availability of nutrients for algae growth by decreasing the depth of the surface [[mixed layer]] and inhibiting the upwelling of nutrients from deep waters. This is expected to cause an overall shift towards pelagic phytoplankton production.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt; Changes in multiyear ice volume&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Nghiem|first=S.

Reduction in MYI, a temporal refugia for diatoms in particular, will likely alter sympagic community composition, resulting in bloom initialization that derives from species that overwinter in the water column or sediments instead.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt;

Because sea ice algae are often the base of the food web, these alterations have implications for species of higher trophic levels.&lt;ref name="Kohlbach 2027–2044" /&gt; The reproduction and migration cycles of many polar [[Consumer (food chain)|primary consumers]] are timed with the bloom of sea ice algae, meaning that a change in the timing or location of primary production could shift the distribution of prey populations necessary for significant keystone species. Production timing may also be altered by the melting through of surface melt ponds to the seawater below, which can alter sea ice algal habitat late in the growing season in such a way as to impact grazing communities as they approach winter.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Lee|first=Sang Heon|last2=McRoy|first2=C.

The production of DMSP by sea ice algae also plays an important role in the carbon cycle. DMSP is oxidized by other plankton to dimethylsulfide (DMS), a compound which is linked to cloud formation. Because clouds impact precipitation and the amount of solar radiation reflected back to space ([[albedo]]), this process could create a positive feedback loop.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Sievert|first=Stefan|last2=Kiene|first2=Ronald|last3=Schulz-Vogt|first3=Heide|title=The Sulfur Cycle|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.5670/oceanog.2007.55|journal=Oceanography|volume=20|issue=2|pages=117–123|doi=10.5670/oceanog.2007.55|year=2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cloud cover would increase the [[Solar irradiance|insolation]] reflected back to space by the atmosphere, potentially helping to cool the planet and support more polar habitats for sea ice algae. As of 1987, research has suggested that a doubling of [[Cloud condensation nuclei|cloud-condensation nuclei]], of which DMS is one type, would be required to counteract warming due to increased atmospheric CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; concentrations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Charlson|first=Robert J.|last2=Lovelock|first2=James E.|last3=Andreae|first3=Meinrat O.|last4=Warren|first4=Stephen G.|date=1987-04-22|title=Oceanic phytoplankton, atmospheric sulphur, cloud albedo and climate|url=http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v326/n6114/pdf/326655a0.pdf|journal=Nature|language=en|volume=326|issue=6114|pages=655–661|doi=10.1038/326655a0|issn=0028-0836}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Organisms dwelling on the sea ice eventually detach from the ice and fall through the water column, particularly when the sea ice melts. A portion of the material that reaches the seafloor is buried before it is consumed and is thus preserved in the [[Core sample|sedimentary record]].

There are a number of organisms whose value as proxies for the presence of sea ice has been investigated, including particular species of diatoms, [[dinoflagellate cysts]], [[ostracod]]s, and [[Foraminifera|foraminifers]]. Variation in carbon and oxygen isotopes in a sediment core can also be used to make inferences about sea ice extent. Each proxy has advantages and disadvantages; for example, some diatom species that are unique to sea ice are very abundant in the sediment record, however, preservation efficiency can vary.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=de Vernal|first=Anne|last2=Gersonde|first2=Rainer|last3=Goosse|first3=Hugues|last4=Seidenkrantz|first4=Marit-Solveig|last5=Wolff|first5=Eric W.|date=2013-11-01|title=Sea ice in the paleoclimate system: the challenge of reconstructing sea ice from proxies – an introduction|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0277379113003089|journal=Quaternary Science Reviews|series=Sea Ice in the Paleoclimate System: the Challenge of Reconstructing Sea Ice from Proxies|volume=79|pages=1–8|doi=10.1016/j.quascirev.2013.08.009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Terrestrial ice algae ==
Algae also occur on terrestrial ice sheets and glaciers. The species found in these habitats are distinct from those associated with sea ice because the system is freshwater. Even within these habitats, there is a wide diversity of habitat types and algal assemblages. For example, cryosestic communities are specifically found on the surface of glaciers where the snow periodically melts during the day.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-1-4020-6112-7_17|title=Algae and Cyanobacteria in Extreme Environments|last=Komárek|first=Jiří|last2=Nedbalová|first2=Linda|date=2007-01-01|publisher=Springer Netherlands|isbn=9781402061110|editor-last=Seckbach|editor-first=Dr Joseph|series=Cellular Origin, Life in Extreme Habitats and Astrobiology|pages=321–342|language=en|doi=10.1007/978-1-4020-6112-7_17}}&lt;/ref&gt; On enduring ice sheets and snow pack, terrestrial ice algae often color the ice due to accessory pigments, popularly known as "[[watermelon snow]]".

=== Implications for climate change ===
Recent research, known as the Black and Bloom project, has shown the impact of ice algae on the rate of melting of ice sheets. Because of the dark colors of the algae, sunlight absorption by the ice is enhanced, leading to an increase in the melting rate.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Witze|first=Alexandra|date=2016-07-21|title=Algae are melting away the Greenland ice sheet|url=http://www.nature.com/news/algae-are-melting-away-the-greenland-ice-sheet-1.20265|journal=Nature|language=en|volume=535|issue=7612|pages=336–336|doi=10.1038/nature.2016.20265|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170315174437/http://www.nature.com/news/algae-are-melting-away-the-greenland-ice-sheet-1.20265|archivedate=2017-03-15|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The goal of the Black and Bloom project is to determine how much the algae are contributing to the darkening of the ice sheets.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8179">'''Instructional rounds''' is a process that school districts and schools use to better understand teaching and learning in schools in order to improve learning at scale. In an instructional rounds session, a group of educators from perhaps 20 to 40 in size makes a series of visits to classrooms to observe what is taking place in the instructional core (the interactions between students and teachers in the presence of content).  Low inference observation notes are taken about a learning problem identified by the school being observed.  The observation notes are used to create a picture of what has been seen in teaching and learning practices throughout the school.  It is these practices that are shared with the school, not information about individual teachers or students. Adapted from the practice of [[grand rounds]] in medical school,&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; the aim of instructional rounds is to observe teaching and learning to discern root causes for problems identified by the school and to help the school and district create more productive outcomes. Distinct from [[supervision]] and evaluation, rounds are used to describe what is happening in classrooms and the share observations with educators, and are not intended to be [[evaluative]].

== Origin ==
The process of instructional rounds was adapted from medical rounds model that is used in schools of medicine and teaching hospitals to improve practice of prospective and current doctors in diagnosing and curing patients. Physicians use medical rounds as a major way of improving their theory and practice. "In the most commonly used version of medical rounds, a group of medical interns, residents, and supervising or attending physicians visit patients, observe and discuss the evidence for diagnoses, and, after a thorough analysis of evidence, discuss possible treatments."&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

== Description of common practice ==

Instructional rounds include several steps: formation of a network that ideally includes representative members from all those who impact student learning; choosing a problem to be addressed; classroom observation; observation debrief ; detection of the next steps, and regular repetition of this process.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=City|first1=Elizabeth|title=Learning from Instructional Rounds|journal=Educational Leadership|date=2011|volume=69, number 2|issue=Coaching: The New Leadership Skill|pages=36–41}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Network formation ===
Network formation involves the gathering of educators who will regularly meet with each other to do rounds. There are not specific criteria sets for the creation of networks, it depends on the situation, time and preferences of educators. Different kinds of networks could be used to do rounds.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{cite book|last1=City|first1=Elizabeth|last2=Elmore|first2=Richard|last3=Fiarman|first3=Sarah|last4=Lee|first4=Teitel|title=Instructional rounds in education: A network approach to improving teaching and learning|date=2011|publisher=Harvard Education Press|location=8 Story Street First Floor, Cambridge, MA 02138|isbn=9781934742167|edition=7}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some of them are cross-functional in which teachers and administrators work together, while others are [[homogeneous]] in nature composed of [[superintendent (education)|superintendent]]s or teachers exclusively. Instructional rounds could be integrated into existing networks or specially formed new networks of educators. Sometimes members of the network are selected intentionally, according to the subject, content they teach or problem area they share. Other networks are more [[Pragmatism|pragmatic]], for instance, teachers with the same planning time engage in rounds together.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Choosing problem of practice ===
The problem of practice is a specific issue that the school  needs constructive feedback on, worries about or struggles against.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; The problem should be [[observable]] and focused on improving teaching. It is unsolved problem that the school has spent time and money to address, but it is in further need of assistance.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Leading instructional rounds in education|last=Fowler-Finn|first=Thomas|publisher = Harvard Education Press|year = 2013|isbn = 978-1-61250-526-8|location = 8 Story Street, Cambridge, MA 02138|pages = }}&lt;/ref&gt; There are different ways of identifying problems of practice. The best way is to relate these problems to continuous school improvement and to proceed based on data. To determine the problem of practice sometimes the entire staff gathers or only the leadership team meets to identify a problem.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

An example of a problem of practice could be the following: "In reading and writing, our students seem to be doing relatively well on [[Encoding|decoding]], [[vocabulary]], and simple writing tasks, but they are not doing as well as we had hoped on comprehension free-response tasks. Teachers have begun using a workshop method to work with smaller groups of students, but there is no consistency in what happens in those small groups".&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

=== Classroom observation ===
After determining the problem of practice, the network splits into smaller groups of 4-5 teachers that visit approximately 4-5 classrooms for 25 minutes each. Observers collect descriptive data rather than evaluative, meaning that they do not have any [[rubric|rubrics]] to guide them. Observers do have guiding questions associated with the problem they are investigating. For instance, 'What are students and teachers doing and saying?,' 'What is the assignment?,' 'What do students do when they do not understand the concept or instruction?'.

Observers do not look at every issue in the classroom, but only those connected with the problem of practice. For instance, if the issue is lack of higher order thinking skills among students, observers do not pay attention on behavior and attendance of students, their involvement in the task, or teacher behavior, such as writing objectives on the board. Observers attempt to find the cause of the existing problem of practice in school and then identify a viable cure for it.

It is very important that observers do not talk between class observations and save everything they saw, their descriptive feedback, for the official debrief.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Observation debrief ===
The process of debrief consists of three steps: [[description]], [[analysis]], and [[prediction]]. During the description stage, all groups of the network meet together and share their evidence that pertains to the problem of practice with the others. The evidence should be specific and descriptive rather than evaluative and general. Regular practice and peer help could facilitate learning to collect specific and descriptive evidence.

Having gathered a set of evidence, the network can begin analyzing it by looking at trends, patterns, and exceptions across the data. Examples of patterns could be: Students are divided into groups, but work individually; teacher asks simple questions that requires short 1-2 words answers. Each groups of teachers share trends and patterns that have seen. This could help educators to determine common patterns in subject area, grade level and across school. However, sometimes patterns could vary in each subject or grade level.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

At the prediction stage observers answer to the following question, “If you were a student in these classes today and you did everything the teacher asked you to do, what would you know and be able to do?” This question is asked to see what students could learn as a result of the completed assignments and tasks in the class. The responses of the observers could be: Learners will be able to solve mathematical problems, recall information, etc.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

In [[audio engineering]], '''joint''' refers to a joining of several channels of similar information in order to obtain higher quality, a smaller file size, or both.

==Joint stereo==
The term '''joint stereo''' has become prominent as the [[Internet]] has allowed for the transfer of relatively low [[bit rate]], acceptable-quality audio with modest Internet access speeds. Joint stereo refers to any number of encoding techniques used for this purpose. Two forms are described here, both of which are implemented in various ways with different [[codec]]s, such as [[MP3]], [[Advanced Audio Coding|AAC]] and [[Ogg Vorbis]].

===Intensity stereo coding===
This form of joint stereo uses a technique known as '''joint frequency encoding''', which functions on the principle of [[sound localization]]. Human hearing is predominantly less acute at perceiving the direction of certain audio frequencies. By exploiting this characteristic, intensity stereo coding can reduce the data rate of an audio stream with little or no perceived change in apparent quality.

More specifically, the dominance of ''inter-aural time differences (ITD)'' for sound localization by humans is only present for lower frequencies. That leaves ''inter-aural amplitude differences (IAD)'' as the dominant location indicator for higher frequencies. The idea of ''intensity stereo coding'' is to merge the lower spectrum into just one channel (thus reducing overall differences between channels) and to transmit a little side information about how to [[Panning (audio)|pan]] certain frequency regions to recover the ''IAD'' cues.

This type of coding does not perfectly reconstruct the original audio because of the loss of information which results in the simplification of the stereo image and can produce perceptible [[compression artifacts]]. However, for very low bit rates this type of coding usually yields a gain in perceived quality of the audio. It is supported by many audio compression formats (including [[MP3]], [[Advanced Audio Coding|AAC]], [[Vorbis]] and [[Opus_(audio_format)|Opus]]) but not always by every [[encoder]].

===M/S stereo coding===
'''M/S stereo coding''' transforms the left and right channels into a mid channel and a side channel. The mid channel is the sum of the left and right channels, or &lt;math&gt;M = L+R&lt;/math&gt;. The side channel is the difference of the left and right channels, or &lt;math&gt;S = L-R&lt;/math&gt;. Unlike intensity stereo coding, M/S coding is a special case of [[transform coding]], and retains the audio perfectly without introducing artifacts. [[Lossless data compression|Lossless codecs]] such as [[FLAC]] or [[Monkey's Audio]] use M/S stereo coding because of this characteristic.

To reconstruct the original signal, the channels are either added &lt;math&gt;L = \frac{M + S}{2}&lt;/math&gt; or subtracted &lt;math&gt;R = \frac{M - S}{2}&lt;/math&gt;

This form of coding is also sometimes known as matrix stereo and is used in many different forms of audio processing and recording equipment. It is not limited to digital systems and can even be created with passive audio [[transformer]]s or analog [[amplifier]]s. One example of the use of M/S stereo is in [[FM broadcasting|FM]] stereo broadcasting, where &lt;math&gt;L+R&lt;/math&gt; [[modulation|modulates]] the [[carrier wave]] and &lt;math&gt;L-R&lt;/math&gt; modulates a [[subcarrier]]. Another example of M/S stereo is the [[Gramophone_record#Stereophonic_sound|stereophonic microgroove record]]. Lateral motions of a stylus represent the sum of two channels and the vertical motion represents the difference between the channels.

==Joint frequency encoding==
'''Joint frequency encoding''' is an [[encoder|encoding]] technique used in [[audio data compression]] to reduce the [[Bit rate|data rate]].

The idea is to merge a given frequency range of multiple sound channels together so that the resulting encoding will preserve the sound information of that range not as a bundle of separate channels but as one homogeneous data stream. This will destroy the original channel separation permanently, as the information cannot be accurately reconstructed, but will greatly lessen the amount of required storage space. Only some forms of joint stereo use the joint frequency encoding technique, such as intensity stereo coding.

==Implementations==
When used within the MP3 compression process, joint stereo normally employs multiple techniques, and can switch between them for each MPEG frame. Typically, a modern encoder's joint stereo mode uses M/S stereo for some frames and L/R stereo for others, whichever method yields the best result. Encoders use different algorithms to determine when to switch and how much space to allocate to each channel; quality can suffer if the switching is too frequent or if the side channel doesn't get enough bits. With some encoding software, it is possible to force the use of M/S stereo for all frames, mimicking the joint stereo mode of some early encoders like [[Xing Technology|Xing]]. Within the [[LAME]] encoder, this is known as forced joint stereo.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://lame.cvs.sourceforge.net/viewvc/lame/lame/doc/html/detailed.html |title=Detailed command line switches |work=LAME documentation |accessdate=2013-12-13 |quote=JOINT STEREO [...] means the encoder can use (on a frame by frame basis) either L/R stereo or mid/side stereo. In mid/side stereo, [...] more bits are allocated to the mid channel than the side channel. When there isn't too much stereo separation, this effectively increases the bandwidth, so having higher quality with the same amount of bits. Using mid/side stereo inappropriately can result in audible compression artifacts. Too much switching between mid/side and regular stereo can also sound bad. To determine when to switch to mid/side stereo, LAME uses a much more sophisticated algorithm than the one described in the ISO documentation. FORCED MID/SIDE STEREO forces all frames to be encoded with mid/side stereo. It should only be used if you are sure every frame of the input file has very little stereo separation.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As with MP3, [[Ogg Vorbis]] stereo files can employ either L/R stereo or joint stereo. When using joint stereo, both M/S stereo and intensity stereo methods may be used. As opposed to MP3 where M/S stereo (when used) is applied before quantization, an Ogg Vorbis encoder applies M/S stereo to samples in the frequency domain after quantization, making application of M/S stereo a lossless step. After this step, any frequency area can be converted to intensity stereo by removing the corresponding part of the M/S signal's side channel. Ogg Vorbis' floor function will take care of the required left-right panning.

'''Linear time-invariant theory''', commonly known as '''LTI system theory,''' comes from [[applied mathematics]] and has direct applications in [[NMR spectroscopy]], [[seismology]], [[electrical network|circuit]]s, [[signal processing]], [[control theory]], and other technical areas. It investigates the response of a [[linear system|linear]] and [[time-invariant system]] to an arbitrary input signal. Trajectories of these systems are commonly measured and tracked as they move through time (e.g., an acoustic waveform), but in applications like [[image processing]] and [[Classical field theory|field theory]], the LTI systems also have trajectories in spatial dimensions. Thus, these systems are also called ''linear translation-invariant'' to give the theory the most general reach. In the case of generic [[discrete-time]] (i.e., [[sample (signal)|sampled]]) systems, ''linear shift-invariant'' is the corresponding term. A good example of LTI systems are electrical circuits that can be made up of resistors, capacitors, and inductors.&lt;ref&gt;Hespanha 2009, p. 78.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview==
The defining properties of any LTI system are ''linearity'' and ''time invariance''.

* ''Linearity'' means that the relationship between the input and the output of the system is a [[linear map]]: If input &lt;math&gt;x_1(t)\,&lt;/math&gt; produces response &lt;math&gt;y_1(t),\,&lt;/math&gt; and input &lt;math&gt;x_2(t)\,&lt;/math&gt; produces response &lt;math&gt;y_2(t),\,&lt;/math&gt; then the ''scaled'' and ''summed'' input &lt;math&gt;a_1 x_1(t)+ a_2 x_2(t)\,&lt;/math&gt; produces the scaled and summed response &lt;math&gt;a_1 y_1(t) + a_2y_2(t)\,&lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt;a_1&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;a_2&lt;/math&gt; are [[real number|real]] [[scalar (mathematics)|scalar]]s. It follows that this can be extended to an arbitrary number of terms, and so for real numbers &lt;math&gt;c_1, c_2, \ldots, c_k&lt;/math&gt;,
::Input &amp;nbsp; &lt;math&gt;\sum_k c_k\,x_k(t)&lt;/math&gt; &amp;nbsp; produces output &amp;nbsp; &lt;math&gt;\sum_k c_k\,y_k(t).\,&lt;/math&gt;
:In particular,
{{NumBlk|::|Input &amp;nbsp; &lt;math&gt;\int_{-\infty}^{\infty} c_{\omega}\,x_{\omega}(t) \, \operatorname{d}\omega&lt;/math&gt; &amp;nbsp; produces output &amp;nbsp; &lt;math&gt;\int_{-\infty}^{\infty} c_{\omega}\,y_{\omega}(t) \, \operatorname{d}\omega\,&lt;/math&gt;|{{EquationRef|Eq.1}}}}
:where &lt;math&gt;c_{\omega}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;x_{\omega}&lt;/math&gt; are scalars and inputs that vary over a [[Continuum (set theory)|continuum]] indexed by &lt;math&gt;\omega&lt;/math&gt;.  Thus if an input function can be represented by a continuum of input functions, combined "linearly", as shown, then the corresponding output function can be represented by the corresponding continuum of output functions, ''scaled'' and ''summed'' in the same way.

* ''Time invariance'' means that whether we apply an input to the system now or ''T'' seconds from now, the output will be identical except for a time delay of ''T'' seconds. That is, if the output due to input &lt;math&gt;x(t)&lt;/math&gt; is &lt;math&gt;y(t)&lt;/math&gt;, then the output due to input &lt;math&gt;x(t-T)&lt;/math&gt; is &lt;math&gt;y(t-T)&lt;/math&gt;. Hence, the system is time invariant because the output does not depend on the particular time the input is applied.

The fundamental result in LTI system theory is that any LTI system can be characterized entirely by a single function called the system's [[impulse response]].  The output of the system is simply the [[convolution]] of the input to the system with the system's impulse response.  This method of analysis is often called the ''[[time domain]]'' point-of-view.  The same result is true of discrete-time linear shift-invariant systems in which signals are discrete-time samples, and convolution is defined on sequences.

[[File:LTI.png|thumb|Relationship between the '''time domain''' and the '''frequency domain'''|right|320px]]

Equivalently, any LTI system can be characterized in the ''[[frequency domain]]'' by the system's [[transfer function]], which is the [[Laplace transform]] of the system's impulse response (or [[Z transform]] in the case of discrete-time systems).  As a result of the properties of these transforms, the output of the system in the frequency domain is the product of the transfer function and the transform of the input. In other words, convolution in the time domain is equivalent to multiplication in the frequency domain.

For all LTI systems, the [[eigenfunction]]s, and the basis functions of the transforms, are [[complex number|complex]] [[exponential function|exponentials]].  This is, if the input to a system is the complex waveform &lt;math&gt;A_s e^{st}&lt;/math&gt; for some complex amplitude &lt;math&gt;A_s&lt;/math&gt; and complex frequency &lt;math&gt;s&lt;/math&gt;, the output will be some complex constant times the input, say &lt;math&gt;B_s e^{st}&lt;/math&gt; for some new complex amplitude &lt;math&gt;B_s&lt;/math&gt;.  The ratio &lt;math&gt;B_s/A_s&lt;/math&gt; is the transfer function at frequency &lt;math&gt;s&lt;/math&gt;.

Since [[sine wave|sinusoids]] are a sum of complex exponentials with complex-conjugate frequencies, if the input to the system is a sinusoid, then the output of the system will also be a sinusoid, perhaps with a different [[amplitude]] and a different [[phase (waves)|phase]], but always with the same frequency upon reaching steady-state. LTI systems cannot produce frequency components that are not in the input.

LTI system theory is good at describing many important systems.  Most LTI systems are considered "easy" to analyze, at least compared to the time-varying and/or [[nonlinear]] case.  Any system that can be modeled as a linear homogeneous [[differential equation]] with constant coefficients is an LTI system.  Examples of such systems are [[electrical network|electrical circuits]] made up of [[resistor]]s, [[inductor]]s, and [[capacitor]]s (RLC circuits).  Ideal spring–mass–damper systems are also LTI systems, and are mathematically equivalent to RLC circuits.

Most LTI system concepts are similar between the continuous-time and discrete-time (linear shift-invariant) cases.  In image processing, the time variable is replaced with two space variables, and the notion of time invariance is replaced by two-dimensional shift invariance.  When analyzing [[filter bank]]s and [[MIMO (systems theory)|MIMO]] systems, it is often useful to consider [[matrix (mathematics)|vectors]] of signals.

A linear system that is not time-invariant can be solved using other approaches such as the [[Green's function|Green function]] method. The same method must be used when the initial conditions of the problem are not null.

== Continuous-time systems ==

=== Impulse response and convolution===
The behavior of a linear, continuous-time, time-invariant system with input signal ''x''(''t'') and output signal ''y''(''t'') is described by the convolution integral''':'''&lt;ref&gt;Crutchfield, p. 1. ''Welcome!''&lt;/ref&gt;
:{|
|&lt;math&gt;y(t) = (x * h)(t)\,&lt;/math&gt;
|&lt;math&gt;{}\quad \stackrel{\mathrm{def}}{=} \int\limits_{-\infty}^{\infty} x(t-\tau)\cdot h(\tau) \, \mathrm{d}\tau&lt;/math&gt;
|-
|
|&lt;math&gt;{}\quad = \int\limits_{-\infty}^\infty x(\tau)\cdot h(t-\tau) \,\mathrm{d}\tau,&lt;/math&gt; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; (using [[Convolution#Commutativity|commutativity]])
|}

where &lt;math&gt;\textstyle h(t)&lt;/math&gt; is the system's response to an [[Dirac delta function|impulse]]''':''' &amp;nbsp;&lt;math&gt;\textstyle x(\tau) = \delta(\tau).&lt;/math&gt; &amp;nbsp; &lt;math&gt;\textstyle y(t) &lt;/math&gt; is therefore proportional to a weighted average of the input function &lt;math&gt;\textstyle x(\tau).&lt;/math&gt;&amp;nbsp; The weighting function is &lt;math&gt;\textstyle h(-\tau),&lt;/math&gt; simply shifted by amount &lt;math&gt;\textstyle t.&lt;/math&gt; &amp;nbsp; As &lt;math&gt;\textstyle t&lt;/math&gt; changes, the weighting function emphasizes different parts of the input function.  When &lt;math&gt;\textstyle h(\tau)&lt;/math&gt; is zero for all negative &lt;math&gt;\textstyle \tau,&lt;/math&gt;&amp;nbsp; &lt;math&gt;\textstyle y(t)&lt;/math&gt; depends only on values of &lt;math&gt;\textstyle x&lt;/math&gt; prior to time &lt;math&gt;\textstyle t,&lt;/math&gt;&amp;nbsp; and the system is said to be [[Causal system|causal]].

To understand why the convolution produces the output of an LTI system, let the notation &lt;math&gt;\textstyle \{x(u-\tau);\ u\}&lt;/math&gt; represent the function &lt;math&gt;\textstyle x(u-\tau)&lt;/math&gt; with variable &lt;math&gt;\textstyle u&lt;/math&gt; and constant &lt;math&gt;\textstyle \tau.&lt;/math&gt;&amp;nbsp;  And let the shorter notation &lt;math&gt;\textstyle \{x\}\,&lt;/math&gt; represent &lt;math&gt;\textstyle \{x(u);\ u\}.&lt;/math&gt;  Then a continuous-time system transforms an input function, &lt;math&gt;\textstyle \{x\},&lt;/math&gt; into an output function, &lt;math&gt;\textstyle \{y\}&lt;/math&gt;. And in general, every value of the output can depend on every value of the input. This concept is represented by''':'''

:&lt;math&gt;y(t)\ \stackrel{\text{def}}{=}\ O_t\{x\},&lt;/math&gt;
 
where &lt;math&gt;\textstyle O_t&lt;/math&gt; is the transformation operator for time &lt;math&gt;\textstyle t&lt;/math&gt;. In a typical system, &lt;math&gt;\textstyle y(t)&lt;/math&gt; depends most heavily on the values of &lt;math&gt;\textstyle x&lt;/math&gt; that occurred near time &lt;math&gt;\textstyle t.&lt;/math&gt;&amp;nbsp; Unless the transform itself changes with &lt;math&gt;\textstyle t,&lt;/math&gt; the output function is just constant, and the system is uninteresting.

For a linear system, &lt;math&gt;\textstyle O&lt;/math&gt; must satisfy {{EquationNote|Eq.1}} ''':'''

{{NumBlk|:|&lt;math&gt;
O_t\left\{\int\limits_{-\infty}^\infty c_{\tau}\ x_{\tau}(u) \, \mathrm{d}\tau ;\ u\right\} = \int\limits_{-\infty}^\infty c_\tau\ \underbrace{y_\tau(t)}_{O_t\{x_\tau\}} \, \mathrm{d}\tau.
\,&lt;/math&gt;|{{EquationRef|Eq.2}}}}

And the time-invariance requirement is''':'''

{{NumBlk|:|&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
O_t\{x(u-\tau);\ u\}\ &amp;\stackrel{\quad}{=}\ y(t-\tau)\\
&amp;\stackrel{\text{def}}{=}\ O_{t-\tau}\{x\}.\,
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;|{{EquationRef|Eq.3}}}}

In this notation, we can write the '''impulse response''' as &amp;nbsp;&lt;math&gt;\textstyle h(t) \ \stackrel{\text{def}}{=}\ O_t\{\delta(u);\ u\}.&lt;/math&gt;

Similarly''':'''
:{|
|&lt;math&gt;h(t-\tau)\,&lt;/math&gt;
|&lt;math&gt;{}\stackrel{\text{def}}{=}\ O_{t-\tau}\{\delta(u);\ u\}&lt;/math&gt;
|-
|
|&lt;math&gt;{}= O_t\{\delta(u-\tau);\ u\}.\,&lt;/math&gt; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; (using {{EquationNote|Eq.3}})
|}

Substituting this result into the convolution integral''':'''

:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
(x * h)(t) &amp;= \int\limits_{-\infty}^\infty x(\tau)\cdot h(t-\tau) \,\mathrm{d}\tau \\[4pt]
&amp;= \int\limits_{-\infty}^\infty x(\tau)\cdot O_t\{\delta(u-\tau);\ u\} \, \mathrm{d}\tau,\,
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

which has the form of the right side of {{EquationNote|Eq.2}} for the case &lt;math&gt;\textstyle c_\tau = x(\tau)&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\textstyle x_\tau(u) = \delta(u-\tau).&lt;/math&gt;&lt;br&gt;
{{EquationNote|Eq.2}} then allows this continuation''':'''

:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
(x * h)(t) &amp;= O_t\left\{\int\limits_{-\infty}^\infty x(\tau)\cdot \delta(u-\tau) \, \mathrm{d}\tau;\ u \right\}\\ 
&amp;= O_t\left\{x(u);\ u \right\}\\ 
&amp;\ \stackrel{\text{def}}{=}\ y(t).\,
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

In summary, the input function, &lt;math&gt;\textstyle \{x\},&lt;/math&gt;&amp;nbsp; can be represented by a continuum of time-shifted impulse functions, combined "linearly", as shown at {{EquationRef|Eq.1}}.  The system's linearity property allows the system's response to be represented by the corresponding continuum of impulse &lt;u&gt;responses&lt;/u&gt;, combined in the same way. &amp;nbsp;And the time-invariance property allows that combination to be represented by the convolution integral.

The mathematical operations above have a simple graphical simulation.&lt;ref&gt;Crutchfield, p. 1. ''Exercises''&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Exponentials as eigenfunctions ===
An [[eigenfunction]] is a function for which the output of the operator is a scaled version of the same function. That is,
:&lt;math&gt;\mathcal{H}f = \lambda f,&lt;/math&gt;
where ''f'' is the eigenfunction and &lt;math&gt;\lambda&lt;/math&gt; is the [[eigenvalue]], a constant.

The [[exponential function]]s &lt;math&gt;A e^{s t}&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;A, s \in \mathbb{C}&lt;/math&gt;, are [[eigenfunction]]s of a [[linear]], [[time-invariant]] operator. A simple proof illustrates this concept. Suppose the input is &lt;math&gt;x(t) = A e^{s t}&lt;/math&gt;. The output of the system with impulse response &lt;math&gt;h(t)&lt;/math&gt; is then

:&lt;math&gt;\int_{-\infty}^\infty h(t - \tau) A e^{s \tau}\, \operatorname{d} \tau&lt;/math&gt;

which, by the commutative property of [[convolution]], is equivalent to

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
\overbrace{\int_{-\infty}^\infty h(\tau) \, A e^{s (t - \tau)} \, \operatorname{d} \tau}^{\mathcal{H} f}
&amp;= \int_{-\infty}^\infty h(\tau) \, A e^{s t} e^{-s \tau} \, \operatorname{d} \tau \\
&amp;= A e^{s t} \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} h(\tau) \, e^{-s \tau} \, \operatorname{d} \tau \\
&amp;= \overbrace{\underbrace{A e^{s t}}_{\text{Input}}}^{f} \overbrace{\underbrace{H(s)}_{\text{Scalar}}}^{\lambda},
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;
where the scalar
:&lt;math&gt;H(s)\ \stackrel{\text{def}}{=}\ \int_{-\infty}^\infty h(t) e^{-s t} \, \operatorname{d} t&lt;/math&gt;
is dependent only on the parameter ''s''.

So the system's response is a scaled version of the input. In particular, for any &lt;math&gt;A, s \in \mathbb{C}&lt;/math&gt;, the system output is the product of the input &lt;math&gt;A e^{st}&lt;/math&gt; and the constant &lt;math&gt;H(s)&lt;/math&gt;. Hence, &lt;math&gt;A e^{s t}&lt;/math&gt; is an [[eigenfunction]] of an LTI system, and the corresponding [[eigenvalue]] is &lt;math&gt;H(s)&lt;/math&gt;.

==== Direct proof ====
It is also possible to directly derive complex exponentials as eigenfunctions of LTI systems.

Let's set &lt;math&gt;v(t) = e^{i \omega t}&lt;/math&gt; some complex exponential and &lt;math&gt;v_a(t) = e^{i \omega (t+a)}&lt;/math&gt; a time-shifted version of it.

&lt;math&gt;H[v_a](t) = e^{i\omega a} H[v](t)&lt;/math&gt; by linearity with respect to the constant &lt;math&gt;e^{i \omega a}&lt;/math&gt; .

&lt;math&gt;H[v_a](t) = H[v](t+a)&lt;/math&gt; by time invariance of &lt;math&gt;H&lt;/math&gt; .

So &lt;math&gt;H[v](t+a) = e^{i \omega a} H[v](t)&lt;/math&gt;. Setting &lt;math&gt;t = 0&lt;/math&gt; and renaming we get :

&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;H[v](\tau) = e^{i\omega \tau} H[v](0)&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

i.e. that a complex exponential &lt;math&gt;e^{i \omega \tau}&lt;/math&gt; as input will give a complex exponential of same frequency as output.

=== Fourier and Laplace transforms ===
The eigenfunction property of exponentials is very useful for both analysis and insight into LTI systems.  The [[Laplace transform]]

:&lt;math&gt;H(s)\ \stackrel{\text{def}}{=}\ \mathcal{L}\{h(t)\}\ \stackrel{\text{def}}{=}\ \int_{-\infty}^\infty h(t) e^{-s t} \, \operatorname{d} t&lt;/math&gt;

is exactly the way to get the eigenvalues from the impulse response.  Of particular interest are pure sinusoids (i.e., exponential functions of the form &lt;math&gt;e^{j \omega t}&lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt;\omega \in \mathbb{R}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;j\ \stackrel{\text{def}}{=}\ \sqrt{-1}&lt;/math&gt;).  These are generally called complex exponentials even though the argument is purely imaginary. The [[Fourier transform]] &lt;math&gt;H(j \omega) = \mathcal{F}\{h(t)\}&lt;/math&gt; gives the eigenvalues for pure complex sinusoids. Both of &lt;math&gt;H(s)&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;H(j\omega)&lt;/math&gt; are called the ''system function'', ''system response'', or ''transfer function''.

The Laplace transform is usually used in the context of one-sided signals, i.e. signals that are zero for all values of ''t'' less than some value. Usually, this "start time" is set to zero, for convenience and without loss of generality, with the transform integral being taken from zero to infinity (the transform shown above with lower limit of integration of negative infinity is formally known as the [[bilateral Laplace transform]]).

The Fourier transform is used for analyzing systems that process signals that are infinite in extent, such as modulated sinusoids, even though it cannot be directly applied to input and output signals that are not [[square integrable]].  The Laplace transform actually works directly for these signals if they are zero before a start time, even if they are not square integrable, for stable systems.  The Fourier transform is often applied to spectra of infinite signals via the  [[Wiener–Khinchin theorem]] even when Fourier transforms of the signals do not exist.

Due to the convolution property of both of these transforms, the convolution that gives the output of the system can be transformed to a multiplication in the transform domain, given signals for which the transforms exist
:&lt;math&gt;y(t) = (h*x)(t)\ \stackrel{\text{def}}{=}\ \int_{-\infty}^\infty h(t - \tau) x(\tau) \, \operatorname{d} \tau\ \stackrel{\text{def}}{=}\ \mathcal{L}^{-1}\{H(s)X(s)\}.&lt;/math&gt;

Not only is it often easier to do the transforms, multiplication, and inverse transform than the original convolution, but one can also gain insight into the behavior of the system from the system response.  One can look at the modulus of the system function |''H''(''s'')| to see whether the input &lt;math&gt;\exp({s t})&lt;/math&gt; is ''passed'' (let through) the system or ''rejected'' or ''attenuated'' by the system (not let through).

=== Examples ===
* A simple example of an LTI operator is the [[derivative]].
** &lt;math&gt; \frac{\operatorname{d}}{\operatorname{d}t} \left( c_1 x_1(t) + c_2 x_2(t) \right) = c_1 x'_1(t) + c_2 x'_2(t) &lt;/math&gt; &amp;nbsp; (i.e., it is linear)
** &lt;math&gt; \frac{\operatorname{d}}{\operatorname{d}t} x(t-\tau) = x'(t-\tau) &lt;/math&gt; &amp;nbsp; (i.e., it is time invariant)
:When the Laplace transform of the derivative is taken, it transforms to a simple multiplication by the Laplace variable ''s''.
::&lt;math&gt; \mathcal{L}\left\{\frac{\operatorname{d}}{\operatorname{d}t}x(t)\right\} = s X(s) &lt;/math&gt;
:That the derivative has such a simple Laplace transform partly explains the utility of the transform.

* Another simple LTI operator is an averaging operator
::&lt;math&gt; \mathcal{A}\left\{x(t)\right\}\ \stackrel{\text{def}}{=}\ \int_{t-a}^{t+a} x(\lambda) \, \operatorname{d} \lambda. &lt;/math&gt;
:By the linearity of integration,
::&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
\mathcal{A} \{c_1 x_1(t) + c_2 x_2(t)\}
&amp;= \int_{t-a}^{t+a} ( c_1 x_1(\lambda) + c_2 x_2(\lambda)) \, \operatorname{d} \lambda\\
&amp;= c_1 \int_{t-a}^{t+a} x_1(\lambda) \, \operatorname{d} \lambda + c_2 \int_{t-a}^{t+a} x_2(\lambda) \, \operatorname{d} \lambda\\
&amp;= c_1 \mathcal{A}\{x_1(t)\} + c_2 \mathcal{A} \{x_2(t) \},
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;
:it is linear. Additionally, because
::&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
\mathcal{A}\left\{x(t-\tau)\right\}
&amp;= \int_{t-a}^{t+a} x(\lambda-\tau) \, \operatorname{d} \lambda\\
&amp;= \int_{(t-\tau)-a}^{(t-\tau)+a} x(\xi) \, \operatorname{d} \xi\\
&amp;=  \mathcal{A}\{x\}(t-\tau),
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;
:it is time invariant. In fact, &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{A}&lt;/math&gt; can be written as a convolution with the [[boxcar function]] &lt;math&gt;\Pi(t)&lt;/math&gt;. That is,
::&lt;math&gt; \mathcal{A}\left\{x(t)\right\} = \int_{-\infty}^\infty \Pi\left(\frac{\lambda-t}{2a}\right) x(\lambda) \, \operatorname{d} \lambda, &lt;/math&gt;
:where the boxcar function
::&lt;math&gt;\Pi(t)\ \stackrel{\text{def}}{=}\ \begin{cases} 1 &amp;\text{if } |t| &lt; \frac{1}{2},\\ 0 &amp;\text{if } |t| &gt; \frac{1}{2}.\end{cases}&lt;/math&gt;

=== Important system properties ===
Some of the most important properties of a system are causality and stability.  Causality is  a necessity if the independent variable is time, but not all systems have time as an independent variable.  For example, a system that processes still images does not need to be causal.  Non-causal systems can be built and can be useful in many circumstances.  Even [[Quadrature filter|non-real]] systems can be built and are very useful in many contexts.
&lt;!--does anyone have any counterexamples?  a non-causal LTI CT system?--&gt;

==== Causality ====
{{main|Causal system}}
&lt;!--the causal system article needs work--&gt;
A system is causal if the output depends only on present and past, but not future inputs.  A necessary and sufficient condition for causality is

:&lt;math&gt;h(t) = 0 \quad \forall t &lt; 0,&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;h(t)&lt;/math&gt; is the impulse response.  It is not possible in general to determine causality from the Laplace transform, because the inverse transform is not unique.  When a [[region of convergence]] is specified, then causality can be determined.

==== Stability ====
{{main|BIBO stability}}
A system is '''bounded-input, bounded-output stable''' (BIBO stable) if, for every bounded input, the output is finite.  Mathematically, if every input satisfying

:&lt;math&gt;\ \|x(t)\|_{\infty} &lt; \infty&lt;/math&gt;

leads to an output satisfying

:&lt;math&gt;\ \|y(t)\|_{\infty} &lt; \infty&lt;/math&gt;

(that is, a finite [[Infinity norm|maximum absolute value]] of &lt;math&gt;x(t)&lt;/math&gt; implies a finite maximum absolute value of &lt;math&gt;y(t)&lt;/math&gt;), then the system is stable.  A necessary and sufficient condition is that &lt;math&gt;h(t)&lt;/math&gt;, the impulse response, is in [[Lp space|L&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;]] (has a finite L&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; norm):

:&lt;math&gt;\ \|h(t)\|_1 = \int_{-\infty}^\infty |h(t)| \, \operatorname{d}t &lt; \infty.&lt;/math&gt;

In the frequency domain, the [[region of convergence]] must contain the imaginary axis &lt;math&gt;s=j\omega&lt;/math&gt;.

As an example, the ideal [[low-pass filter]] with impulse response equal to a [[sinc function]] is not BIBO stable, because the sinc function does not have a finite L&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; norm.  Thus, for some bounded input, the output of the ideal low-pass filter is unbounded.  In particular, if the input is zero for &lt;math&gt;t &lt; 0\,&lt;/math&gt; and equal to a sinusoid at the [[cut-off frequency]] for &lt;math&gt;t &gt; 0\,&lt;/math&gt;, then the output will be unbounded for all times other than the zero crossings.

== Discrete-time systems ==
Almost everything in continuous-time systems has a counterpart in discrete-time systems.  &lt;!-- this section may be very redundant.  don't remove this redundancy because these should probably be separate articles. --&gt;

=== Discrete-time systems from continuous-time systems ===
In many contexts, a discrete time (DT) system is really part of a larger continuous time (CT) system.  For example, a digital recording system takes an analog sound, digitizes it, possibly processes the digital signals, and plays back an analog sound for people to listen to.

Formally, the DT signals studied are almost always uniformly sampled versions of CT signals.  If &lt;math&gt;x(t)&lt;/math&gt; is a CT signal, then an [[analog to digital converter]] will transform it to the DT signal:

:&lt;math&gt;x[n] \ \stackrel{\text{def}}{=}\ x(nT) \qquad \forall \, n \in \mathbb{Z},&lt;/math&gt;

where ''T'' is the [[sampling frequency|sampling period]].  It is very important to limit the range of frequencies in the input signal for faithful representation in the DT signal, since then the [[sampling theorem]] guarantees that no information about the CT signal is lost.  A DT signal can only contain a frequency range of &lt;math&gt;1/(2T)&lt;/math&gt;; other frequencies are [[aliasing|aliased]] to the same range.

=== Impulse response and convolution ===

Let &lt;math&gt;\{x[m-k];\ m\}&lt;/math&gt; represent the sequence &lt;math&gt;\{x[m-k];\text{ for all integer values of } m\}.&lt;/math&gt;

And let the shorter notation &lt;math&gt;\{x\}\,&lt;/math&gt; represent &lt;math&gt;\{x[m];\ m\}.&lt;/math&gt;

A discrete system transforms an input sequence, &lt;math&gt;\{x\}&lt;/math&gt; into an output sequence, &lt;math&gt;\{y\}.&lt;/math&gt; In general, every element of the output can depend on every element of the input.  Representing the transformation operator by &lt;math&gt;O&lt;/math&gt;, we can write:

:&lt;math&gt;y[n] \ \stackrel{\text{def}}{=}\ O_n\{x\}.&lt;/math&gt;
 
Note that unless the transform itself changes with '''n''', the output sequence is just constant, and the system is uninteresting.  (Thus the subscript, '''n'''.) In a typical system, '''y[n]''' depends most heavily on the elements of '''x''' whose indices are near '''n'''.

For the special case of the [[Kronecker delta function]], &lt;math&gt;x[m] = \delta[m],&lt;/math&gt; the output sequence is the '''impulse response:'''

:&lt;math&gt;h[n] \ \stackrel{\text{def}}{=}\ O_n\{\delta[m];\ m\}.\,&lt;/math&gt;

For a linear system, &lt;math&gt;O&lt;/math&gt; must satisfy:
{{NumBlk|:|&lt;math&gt;
O_n\left\{\sum_{k=-\infty}^{\infty} c_k\cdot x_k[m];\ m\right\} = 
\sum_{k=-\infty}^{\infty} c_k\cdot O_n\{x_k\}.
\,&lt;/math&gt;|{{EquationRef|Eq.4}}}}

And the time-invariance requirement is:
{{NumBlk|:|&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
O_n\{x[m-k];\ m\}\ &amp;\stackrel{\quad}{=}\ y[n-k]\\
&amp;\stackrel{\text{def}}{=}\ O_{n-k}\{x\}.\,
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;|{{EquationRef|Eq.5}}}}

In such a system, the impulse response, &lt;math&gt;\{h\},\,&lt;/math&gt; characterizes the system completely.  I.e., for any input sequence, the output sequence can be calculated in terms of the input and the impulse response. To see how that is done, consider the identity:

:&lt;math&gt;
x[m] \equiv \sum_{k=-\infty}^{\infty} x[k]\cdot \delta[m-k],
\,&lt;/math&gt;

which expresses &lt;math&gt;\{x\}\,&lt;/math&gt; in terms of a sum of weighted delta functions.

Therefore:

:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
y[n] = O_n\{x\}
&amp;= O_n\left\{\sum_{k=-\infty}^\infty x[k]\cdot \delta[m-k];\ m \right\}\\
&amp;= \sum_{k=-\infty}^\infty x[k]\cdot O_n\{\delta[m-k];\ m\},\,
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

where we have invoked {{EquationNote|Eq.4}} for the case &lt;math&gt;c_k = x[k]\,&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;x_k[m] = \delta[m-k].\,&lt;/math&gt;

And because of {{EquationNote|Eq.5}}, we may write:

:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
O_n\{\delta[m-k];\ m\}\ &amp;\stackrel{\quad}{=}\ O_{n-k}\{\delta[m];\ m\}\\
&amp;\stackrel{\text{def}}{=}\ h[n-k].\,
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

Therefore:

:{|
|&lt;math&gt;y[n]\,&lt;/math&gt;
|&lt;math&gt;= \sum_{k=-\infty}^{\infty} x[k]\cdot h[n-k]\,&lt;/math&gt;
|-
|
|&lt;math&gt;= \sum_{k=-\infty}^{\infty} x[n-k]\cdot h[k],&lt;/math&gt; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; ([[Convolution#Commutativity|commutativity]])
|}

which is the familiar discrete convolution formula.  The operator &lt;math&gt;O_n\,&lt;/math&gt; can therefore be interpreted as proportional to a weighted average of the function '''x[k]'''.
The weighting function is '''h[-k]''', simply shifted by amount '''n'''. As '''n''' changes, the weighting function emphasizes different parts of the input function.  Equivalently, the system's response to an impulse at '''n=0''' is a "time" reversed copy of the unshifted weighting function.  When '''h[k]''' is zero for all negative '''k''', the system is said to be [[Causal system|causal]].

=== Exponentials as eigenfunctions ===
An [[eigenfunction]] is a function for which the output of the operator is the same function, scaled by some constant.  In symbols,
:&lt;math&gt;\mathcal{H}f = \lambda f&lt;/math&gt;,
where ''f'' is the eigenfunction and &lt;math&gt;\lambda&lt;/math&gt; is the [[eigenvalue]], a constant.

The [[exponential function]]s &lt;math&gt;z^n = e^{sT n}&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;n \in \mathbb{Z}&lt;/math&gt;, are [[eigenfunction]]s of a [[linear]], [[time-invariant]] operator.  &lt;math&gt;T \in \mathbb{R}&lt;/math&gt; is the sampling interval, and &lt;math&gt;z = e^{sT}, \ z,s \in \mathbb{C}&lt;/math&gt;.  A simple proof illustrates this concept.

Suppose the input is &lt;math&gt;x[n] = \,\!z^n&lt;/math&gt;. The output of the system with impulse response &lt;math&gt;h[n]&lt;/math&gt; is then

:&lt;math&gt;\sum_{m=-\infty}^{\infty} h[n-m] \, z^m&lt;/math&gt;

which is equivalent to the following by the commutative property of [[convolution]]

:&lt;math&gt;\sum_{m=-\infty}^{\infty} h[m] \, z^{(n - m)} = z^n \sum_{m=-\infty}^{\infty} h[m] \, z^{-m} = z^n H(z)&lt;/math&gt;
where
:&lt;math&gt;H(z)\ \stackrel{\text{def}}{=}\ \sum_{m=-\infty}^\infty h[m] z^{-m}&lt;/math&gt;
is dependent only on the parameter ''z''.

So &lt;math&gt;z^n&lt;/math&gt; is an [[eigenfunction]] of an LTI system because the system response is the same as the input times the constant &lt;math&gt;H(z)&lt;/math&gt;.

=== Z and discrete-time Fourier transforms ===
The eigenfunction property of exponentials is very useful for both analysis and insight into LTI systems.  The [[Z transform]] 
:&lt;math&gt;H(z) = \mathcal{Z}\{h[n]\} = \sum_{n=-\infty}^\infty h[n] z^{-n}&lt;/math&gt;
is exactly the way to get the eigenvalues from the impulse response.  Of particular interest are pure sinusoids, i.e. exponentials of the form &lt;math&gt;e^{j \omega n}&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;\omega \in \mathbb{R}&lt;/math&gt;.  These can also be written as &lt;math&gt;z^n&lt;/math&gt; with &lt;math&gt;z = e^{j \omega}&lt;/math&gt;.  These are generally called complex exponentials even though the argument is purely imaginary.
The [[discrete-time Fourier transform]] (DTFT) &lt;math&gt;H(e^{j \omega}) = \mathcal{F}\{h[n]\}&lt;/math&gt;
gives the eigenvalues of pure sinusoids.  Both of &lt;math&gt;H(z)&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;H(e^{j\omega})&lt;/math&gt; are called the ''system function'', ''system response'', or ''transfer function'''.

The Z transform is usually used in the context of one-sided signals, i.e. signals that are zero for all values of t less than some value.  Usually, this "start time" is set to zero, for convenience and without loss of generality.  The Fourier transform is used for analyzing signals that are infinite in extent.

Due to the convolution property of both of these transforms, the convolution that gives the output of the system can be transformed to a multiplication in the transform domain. That is,
:&lt;math&gt;y[n] = (h*x)[n] = \sum_{m=-\infty}^\infty h[n-m] x[m] = \mathcal{Z}^{-1}\{H(z)X(z)\}.&lt;/math&gt;

Just as with the Laplace transform transfer function in continuous-time system analysis, the Z transform makes it easier to analyze systems and gain insight into their behavior.  One can look at the modulus of the system function ''|H(z)|'' to see whether the input &lt;math&gt;z^n&lt;/math&gt; is ''passed'' (let through) by the system, or ''rejected'' or ''attenuated'' by the system (not let through).

=== Examples ===
*A simple example of an LTI operator is the delay operator &lt;math&gt;D\{x[n]\} \ \stackrel{\text{def}}{=}\ x[n-1]&lt;/math&gt;.
**&lt;math&gt; D \left( c_1 \cdot x_1[n] + c_2 \cdot x_2[n] \right) = c_1 \cdot x_1[n-1] + c_2\cdot x_2[n-1] = c_1\cdot Dx_1[n] + c_2\cdot Dx_2[n]&lt;/math&gt; &amp;nbsp; (i.e., it is linear)
**&lt;math&gt; D\{x[n-m]\} = x[n-m-1] = x[(n-1)-m] = D\{x\}[n-m]\,&lt;/math&gt; &amp;nbsp; (i.e., it is time invariant)
:The Z transform of the delay operator is a simple multiplication by ''z''&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;. That is,
::&lt;math&gt; \mathcal{Z}\left\{Dx[n]\right\} = z^{-1} X(z). &lt;/math&gt;

*Another simple LTI operator is the averaging operator
::&lt;math&gt; \mathcal{A}\left\{x[n]\right\}\ \stackrel{\text{def}}{=}\ \sum_{k=n-a}^{n+a} x[k].&lt;/math&gt;
:Because of the linearity of sums,
::&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
\mathcal{A}\left\{c_1 x_1[n] + c_2 x_2[n] \right\}
&amp;= \sum_{k=n-a}^{n+a} \left( c_1 x_1[k] + c_2 x_2[k] \right)\\
&amp;= c_1 \sum_{k=n-a}^{n+a} x_1[k] + c_2 \sum_{k=n-a}^{n+a} x_2[k]\\
&amp;= c_1 \mathcal{A}\left\{x_1[n] \right\} + c_2 \mathcal{A}\left\{x_2[n] \right\},
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;
:and so it is linear. Because,
::&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
\mathcal{A}\left\{x[n-m]\right\}
&amp;= \sum_{k=n-a}^{n+a} x[k-m]\\
&amp;= \sum_{k'=(n-m)-a}^{(n-m)+a} x[k']\\
&amp;= \mathcal{A}\left\{x\right\}[n-m],
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;
:it is also time invariant.

=== Important system properties ===
The input-output characteristics of discrete-time LTI system are completely described  by its impulse response &lt;math&gt;h[n]&lt;/math&gt;.
Some of the most important properties of a system are causality and stability.  Unlike CT systems, non-causal DT systems can be realized.  It is trivial to make an acausal [[Finite Impulse Response|FIR]] system causal by adding delays.  It is even possible to make acausal [[Infinite impulse response|IIR]] systems.&lt;ref&gt;Vaidyanathan,1995&lt;/ref&gt; Non-stable systems can be built and can be useful in many circumstances.  Even [[Quadrature filter|non-real]] systems can be built and are very useful in many contexts.

==== Causality ====
{{main|Causal system}}
&lt;!--the causal system article needs work--&gt;
A discrete-time LTI system is causal if the current value of the output depends on only the current value and past values of the input.,&lt;ref&gt;Phillips 2007, p. 508.&lt;/ref&gt;   A necessary and sufficient condition for causality is

:&lt;math&gt;h[n] = 0 \ \forall n &lt; 0,&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;h[n]&lt;/math&gt; is the impulse response.  It is not possible in general to determine causality from the Z transform, because the inverse transform is not unique.  When a [[region of convergence]] is specified, then causality can be determined.

==== Stability ====
{{main|BIBO stability}}
A system is '''bounded input, bounded output stable''' (BIBO stable) if, for every bounded input, the output is finite.  Mathematically, if

:&lt;math&gt;\ \|x[n]\|_{\infty} &lt; \infty&lt;/math&gt;

implies that

:&lt;math&gt;\ \|y[n]\|_{\infty} &lt; \infty&lt;/math&gt;

(that is, if bounded input implies bounded output, in the sense that the [[Infinity norm|maximum absolute values]] of &lt;math&gt;x[n]&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;y[n]&lt;/math&gt; are finite), then the system is stable.  A necessary and sufficient condition is that &lt;math&gt;h[n]&lt;/math&gt;, the impulse response, satisfies

:&lt;math&gt;\|h[n]\|_1\ \stackrel{\text{def}}{=}\ \sum_{n = -\infty}^\infty |h[n]| &lt; \infty.&lt;/math&gt;

In the frequency domain, the [[region of convergence]] must contain the [[unit circle]] (i.e., the [[locus (mathematics)|locus]] satisfying &lt;math&gt;|z|=1&lt;/math&gt; for complex ''z'').

[[File:Linné-Systema Naturae 1735.jpg|thumb|right|300px|The title page of ''Systema Naturae'', Leiden (1735)]]

'''Linnaean taxonomy''' can mean either of two related concepts: 
# the particular form of [[Taxonomy (biology)|biological classification]] (taxonomy) set up by [[Carl Linnaeus]], as set forth in his ''[[Systema Naturae]]'' (1735) and subsequent works. In the taxonomy of Linnaeus there are three kingdoms, divided into ''classes'', and they, in turn, into ''orders'', ''genera'' (singular: ''genus''), and ''species'' (singular: ''species''), with an additional rank lower than species.
# a term for rank-based classification of organisms, in general. That is, taxonomy in the traditional sense of the word: rank-based [[scientific classification]]. This term is especially used as opposed to [[cladistics|cladistic]] systematics, which groups organisms into [[clade]]s. It is attributed to Linnaeus, although he neither invented the concept of ranked classification (it goes back to [[Plato]] and [[Aristotle]]) nor gave it its present form. In fact, it does not have an exact present form, as "Linnaean taxonomy" as such does not really exist: it is a collective (abstracting) term for what actually are several separate fields, which use similar approaches.

'''Linnaean name''' also has two meanings: depending on the context, it may either refer to a formal name given by Linnaeus (personally), such as [[Giraffa camelopardalis|''Giraffa camelopardalis'' Linnaeus, 1758]], or a formal name in the accepted nomenclature (as opposed to a modernistic [[clade]] name).

== The taxonomy of Linnaeus ==
In his ''Imperium Naturae'', Linnaeus established three kingdoms, namely ''Regnum Animale'', ''Regnum Vegetabile'' and ''Regnum Lapideum''. This approach, the Animal, Vegetable and Mineral Kingdoms, survives today in the popular mind, notably in the form of the parlour game question: "Is it [[animal, vegetable or mineral]]?". The work of Linnaeus had a huge impact on science; it was indispensable as a foundation for [[biological nomenclature]], now regulated by the [[nomenclature codes]]. Two of his works, the first edition of the ''[[Species Plantarum]]'' (1753) for plants and the tenth edition of the ''Systema Naturae'' (1758), are accepted as part of the starting points of nomenclature; his binomials (names for species) and generic names take priority over those of others. However, the impact he had on science was not because of the value of his taxonomy.

=== Classification for plants ===
His classes and orders of plants, according to his ''Systema Sexuale'', were never intended to represent natural groups (as opposed to his [[ordo naturalis|''ordines naturales'']] in his ''[[Philosophia Botanica]]'') but only for use in identification. They were used for that purpose well into the nineteenth century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Comstock, J.L.|year=1837 |title= An introduction to the study of botany: including a treatise on vegetable physiology, and descriptions of the most common plants in the middle and northern states |publisher=Robinson, Pratt &amp; Co.|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=QHnvAAAAMAAJ}}&lt;/ref&gt; Within each class were several orders.

[[File:Kalmia latifolia Great Smoky.jpg|thumb|right|''[[Kalmia]]'' is classified according to  Linnaeus' sexual system in class Decandria, order Monogyna, because it has 10 [[stamen]]s and one [[pistil]]]]

The Linnaean classes for plants, in the Sexual System, were: 
* Classis 1. Monandria: flowers with 1 stamen
* Classis 2. Diandria: flowers with 2 stamens
* Classis 3. Triandria: flowers with 3 stamens
* Classis 4. Tetrandria: flowers with 4 stamens
* Classis 5. Pentandria: flowers with 5 stamens
* Classis 6. Hexandria: flowers with 6 stamens
** Hexandria monogynia pp.&amp;nbsp;285–352{{sfn|Linnaeus|1753|loc=[https://www.biodiversitylibrary.org/page/358106#page/297/mode/1up Hexandria monogynia pp.&amp;nbsp;285–352]}}

* Classis 7. Heptandria: flowers with 7 stamens
* Classis 8. Octandria: flowers with 8 stamens
* Classis 9. Enneandria: flowers with 9 stamens
* Classis 10. Decandria: flowers with 10 stamens
* Classis 11. Dodecandria: flowers with 12 stamens
* Classis 12. Icosandria: flowers with 20 (or more) stamens, [[Ovary (plants)#Half-inferior ovary|perigynous]]
* Classis 13. Polyandria: flowers with many stamens, inserted on the [[Receptacle (botany)|receptacle]]
* Classis 14. Didynamia: flowers with 4 stamens, 2 long and 2 short
* Classis 15. Tetradynamia: flowers with 6 stamens, 4 long and 2 short
* Classis 16. Monadelphia; flowers with the anthers separate, but the filaments united, at least at the base
* Classis 17. Diadelphia; flowers with the stamens united in two separate groups
* Classis 18. Polyadelphia; flowers with the stamens united in several separate groups
* Classis 19. Syngenesia; flowers with stamens united by their anthers
* Classis 20. Gynandria; flowers with the stamens united to the pistils
* Classis 21. Monoecia: [[monoecious]] plants
* Classis 22. Dioecia: [[dioecious]] plants
* Classis 23. Polygamia: [[Plant sexual morphology#Plant population|polygamodioecious]] plants
* Classis 24. Cryptogamia: the "flowerless" plants, including [[fern]]s, [[fungus|fungi]], [[algae]], and [[bryophyte]]s

The classes based on the number of stamens were then subdivided by the number of pistils, e.g. ''Hexandria monogynia'' with six stamens and one pistil.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Linnaeus Sexual System|url=http://cronklab.wikidot.com/linnaeus-sexual-system|website=CronkLab|publisher=Biodiversity Research Centre, University of British Columbia|accessdate=26 January 2015|ref={{harvid|Linnaeus Sexual System|2015}}}}

=== Classification for animals ===
[[File:Linnaeus - Regnum Animale (1735).png|thumb|400px|The 1735 classification of animals]]

Only in the Animal Kingdom is the higher taxonomy of Linnaeus still more or less recognizable and some of these names are still in use, but usually not quite for the same groups. He divided the Animal Kingdom into six classes, in the tenth edition, of 1758, these were:
* Classis 1. [[Mammalia in the 10th edition of Systema Naturae|Mammalia]]
* Classis 2. [[Aves in the 10th edition of Systema Naturae|Aves]]
* Classis 3. [[Amphibia in the 10th edition of Systema Naturae|Amphibia]]
* Classis 4. [[Pisces in the 10th edition of Systema Naturae|Pisces]]
* Classis 5. [[Insecta in the 10th edition of Systema Naturae|Insecta]]
* Classis 6. [[Vermes in the 10th edition of Systema Naturae|Vermes]]

=== Classification for minerals ===
His taxonomy of [[mineral]]s has long since dropped from use. In the tenth edition, 1758, of the ''Systema Naturae'', the Linnaean classes were:

* Classis 1. Petræ
* Classis 2. Mineræ
* Classis 3. Fossilia
* Classis 4. Vitamentra

== Rank-based scientific classification ==
{{Main|Taxonomy (biology)}}

This rank-based method of classifying living organisms was originally popularized by (and much later named for) Linnaeus, although it has changed considerably since his time. The greatest innovation of Linnaeus, and still the most important aspect of this system, is the general use of [[binomial nomenclature]], the combination of a [[genus]] name and a second term, which together uniquely identify each [[species]] of organism within a kingdom. For example, the [[human]] species is uniquely identified within the animal kingdom by the name ''Homo sapiens''. No other species of animal can have this same [[binomen]] (the technical term for a binomial in the case of animals). Prior to Linnaean taxonomy, animals were classified according to their mode of movement.

Linnaeus's use of binomial nomenclature was anticipated by the theory of definition used in [[Scholasticism]]. Scholastic logicians and philosophers of nature defined the species man, for example, as ''Animal rationalis'', where ''animal'' was considered a genus and ''rationalis'' (Latin for "rational") the characteristic distinguishing man from all other animals. Treating ''animal'' as the immediate genus of the species man, horse, etc. is of little practical use to the biological taxonomist, however. Accordingly, Linnaeus's classification treats ''animal'' as a class including many genera (subordinated to the animal "kingdom" via intermediary classes such as "orders"), and treats ''homo'' as the genus of a species ''Homo sapiens'', with ''sapiens'' (Latin for "knowing" or "understanding") playing a differentiating role analogous to that played, in the Scholastic system, by ''rationalis'' (the word ''homo'', Latin for "human being", was used by the Scholastics to denote a species, not a genus).

A strength of Linnaean taxonomy is that it can be used to organize the different kinds of living [[organism]]s, simply and practically. Every species can be given a unique (and, one hopes, stable) name, as compared with common names that are often neither unique nor consistent from place to place and language to language. This uniqueness and stability are, of course, a result of the acceptance by working [[Systematics|systematists]] (biologists specializing in taxonomy), not merely of the binomial names themselves, but of the rules governing the use of these names, which are laid down in formal [[nomenclature code]]s.

Species can be placed in a [[taxonomic rank|ranked]] [[hierarchy]], starting with either ''[[Domain (biology)|domains]]'' or ''kingdoms''. Domains are divided into [[Kingdom (biology)|kingdoms]]. Kingdoms are divided into ''[[phylum|phyla]]'' (singular: ''phylum'') &amp;mdash; for [[animal]]s; the term ''division'', used for [[plant]]s and [[fungi]], is equivalent to the rank of phylum (and the current [[International Code of Botanical Nomenclature]] allows the use of either term). Phyla (or divisions) are divided into ''[[Class (biology)|classes]]'', and they, in turn, into ''[[Order (biology)|orders]]'', ''[[Family (biology)|families]]'', ''[[genus|genera]]'' (singular: ''genus''), and ''[[species]]'' (singular: ''species''). There are ranks below species: in zoology, ''subspecies'' (but see ''[[form (zoology)|form]]'' or ''[[morph (zoology)|morph]]''); in botany, ''variety'' (varietas) and ''form'' (forma), etc.

Groups of organisms at any of these ranks are called ''taxa'' (singular: ''[[taxon]]'') or ''taxonomic groups''.

The Linnaean system has proven robust and it remains the only extant working classification system at present that enjoys universal scientific acceptance. However, although the number of ranks is unlimited, in practice any classification becomes more cumbersome the more ranks are added. Among the later subdivisions that have arisen are such entities as phyla, families, and tribes, as well as any number of ranks with prefixes (superfamilies, subfamilies, etc.). The use of newer taxonomic tools such as [[cladistics]] and [[phylogenetic nomenclature]] has led to a different way of looking at evolution (expressed in many nested [[clade]]s) and this sometimes leads to a desire for more ranks. An example of such complexity is the [[Mammal classification#McKenna.2FBell classification|scheme for mammals]] proposed by McKenna and Bell.

=== Alternatives ===
Over time, the understanding of the relationships between living things has changed. Linnaeus could only base his scheme on the structural similarities of the different organisms. The greatest change was the widespread acceptance of [[evolution]] as the mechanism of biological diversity and species formation, following the 1859 publication of Charles Darwin's ''[[On the Origin of Species]]''. It then became generally understood that classifications ought to reflect the [[phylogeny]] of organisms, their descent by evolution. This led to [[evolutionary taxonomy]], where the various [[extant taxon|extant]] and [[extinction|extinct]] are linked together to construct a phylogeny. This is largely what is meant by the term 'Linnaean taxonomy' when used in a modern context.

In [[cladistics]], originating in the work of [[Willi Hennig]], 1950 onwards, each taxon is grouped so as to include the common ancestor of the group's members (and thus to avoid [[polyphyly]]). Such taxa may be either [[monophyly|monophyletic]] (including all descendants) such as genus ''[[Homo]]'', or [[paraphyly|paraphyletic]] (excluding some descendants), such as genus ''[[Australopithecus]]''.

Originally, Linnaeus established three kingdoms in his scheme, namely for [[Plant]]s, [[Animal]]s and an additional group for [[minerals]], which has long since been abandoned.  Since then, various life forms have been moved into three new kingdoms: [[Monera]], for [[prokaryote]]s (i.e., bacteria); [[Protist]]a, for protozoans and most algae; and [[fungus|Fungi]].  This five kingdom scheme is still far from the [[phylogenetics|phylogenetic]] ideal and has largely been supplanted in modern taxonomic work by a division into three domains: [[Bacterium|Bacteria]] and [[Archaea]], which contain the prokaryotes, and [[Eukaryote|Eukaryota]], comprising the remaining forms. These arrangements should not be seen as definitive. They are based on the [[genome]]s of the organisms; as knowledge on this increases, classifications will change.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author1=Embley, T. A.  |author2=Martin, W. |lastauthoramp=yes|date=2006 |title=Eukaryotic evolution, changes and challenges. |journal=Nature |volume=440 |pages=623–630 |doi=10.1038/nature04546 |url=http://www.nature.com/scitable/content/eukaryotic-evolution-changes-and-challenges-13997647}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Representing presumptive evolutionary relationships, especially given the wide acceptance of [[cladistic]] methodology and numerous [[molecular phylogenetic|molecular phylogenies]] that have challenged long-accepted classifications, within the framework of Linnaean taxonomy, is sometimes seen as problematic. Therefore, some systematists have proposed a [[PhyloCode]] to replace it.

Library science (often termed library studies or library and information science) is an interdisciplinary or multidisciplinary field that applies the practices, perspectives, and tools of management, information technology, education, and other areas to libraries; the collection, organization, preservation, and dissemination of information resources; and the political economy of [[information]]. Most professional library jobs require a professional [[Postgraduate education|post-baccalaureate degree]] in library science as a basic credential but this varies widely in different countries. There are also bachelor's, associate, and certificate programs in library science, which provide formal training of [[paraprofessional]] library workers, library technicians, and clerks—as well as preparation for graduate study in library science. A [[library school]] is an [[higher education|institution of higher learning]] specializing in the professional training of librarians. {{as of|2012|April|}} there are 63 [[American Library Association]]-accredited [[Library science]] programs in Canada and the United States&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ala.org/accreditedprograms/directory/alphalist ALA | Alphabetical List of Institutions with ALA-accredited Programs]&lt;/ref&gt; and {{as of|2014|July|lc=y}}, 16 UK institutions offering [[CILIP]]-accredited programmes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.cilip.org.uk/cilip/jobs-careers/starting-library-and-information-career/how-become-librarian-or-information |title=CILIP List of Accredited Qualifications |access-date=2014-07-04 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140709141658/http://www.cilip.org.uk/cilip/jobs-careers/starting-library-and-information-career/how-become-librarian-or-information |archive-date=2014-07-09 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1639">'''Manuscriptology''' is another word for [[codicology]], namely the study of history and literature through the use of hand-written documents. 

The term is in use particularly among scholars of South Asian cultural history because many South Asian manuscripts are not [[Codex|codices]] in the strict sense of the word.  That is to say, South Asian manuscripts are typically written on unbound sheets of paper or palm leaves, in a landscape format.  [[Vellum]] or [[parchment]] - typical writing supports used in the European codex - are unknown in South Asia.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.degruyter.com/view/books/9783110225631/9783110225631.159/9783110225631.159.xml|title=Indian Manuscripts|last=Wujastyk|first=Dominik|language=en|doi=10.1515/9783110225631.159}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

There are exceptions.  The codex format is used for [https://archive.org/stream/MokshopayaSharadaManuscript6/Mokshopaya_Sharada%20Manuscript-6#page/n0/mode/1up manuscripts in Kashmir, for example], where the concept of the manuscript book was influenced from European models transmitted by Islamic culture.

The '''Meredith effect''' is a phenomenon whereby the [[aerodynamic drag]] produced by a [[Radiator (engine cooling)|cooling radiator]] may be offset by careful design of the cooling duct such that useful thrust is produced. The effect was discovered in the 1930s and became more important as the speeds of piston-engined aircraft increased over the next decade.

==Principles of operation==
The Meredith effect occurs when air flowing through a duct is heated by a heat-exchanger or radiator containing a hot working fluid such as [[ethylene glycol]]. Typically the fluid is a coolant carrying [[waste heat]] from an internal combustion engine.&lt;ref name=becker /&gt;

For the effect to occur, the duct must be travelling at a significant speed with respect to the air. Air flowing into the duct meets drag resistance from the radiator surface and is compressed due to the [[Ram-air intake|ram air effect]]. As the air flows through the radiator it is [[heat]]ed, raising its temperature slightly and further increasing its volume. The hot, pressurised air then exits through the exhaust duct which is shaped to be convergent, i.e. to narrow towards the rear. This accelerates the air backwards and the reaction of this acceleration against the installation provides a small forward thrust.&lt;ref name="Meredith"&gt;Meredith, F. W: "Cooling of Aircraft Engines. With Special Reference To Ethylene Glycol Radiators Enclosed In Ducts", Aeronautical Research Council R&amp;M 1683, 1936.&lt;/ref&gt; The air expands and decreases temperature as it passes along the duct, before emerging to join the external air flow. Thus, the three processes of an open [[Brayton cycle]] are achieved: compression, heat addition at constant pressure and expansion. The thrust obtainable depends upon the pressure ratio between the inside and outside of the duct and the temperature of the coolant.&lt;ref name=becker /&gt; The higher boiling point of ethylene glycol compared to water allows the air to attain a higher temperature increasing the specific thrust.  

If the generated thrust is less than the aerodynamic drag of the ducting and radiator, then the arrangement serves to reduce the net aerodynamic drag of the radiator installation. If the generated thrust exceeds the aerodynamic drag of the installation, then the entire assemblage contributes a net forward thrust to the vehicle.

==History==
[[Fredrick Meredith|F. W. Meredith]] was a British engineer working at the [[Royal Aircraft Establishment]] (RAE), [[Farnborough Airfield|Farnborough]]. Reflecting on the principles of liquid cooling, he realized that what was conventionally regarded as waste heat, to be transferred to the atmosphere by a coolant in a radiator, need not be lost. The heat adds energy to the airflow and, with careful design, this may be used to generate thrust. The work was published in 1936.&lt;ref name="Meredith" /&gt;

The phenomenon became known as the "Meredith effect" and was quickly adopted by the designers of prototype fighter aircraft then under development, including the [[Supermarine Spitfire]] and [[Hawker Hurricane]] whose Rolls-Royce PV-12 engine, later named the [[Rolls-Royce Merlin|Merlin]], was cooled by ethylene glycol. An early example of a Meredith effect radiator was incorporated in the design of the Spitfire for the first flight of the prototype on 5 March 1936.&lt;ref&gt;Gingell, G. (Ed.); "''The Supermarine Spitfire - 40 years on''," Royal Aeronautical Society, 1976, Page 13.&lt;/ref&gt;

Many engineers did not understand the operating principles of the effect. A common mistake was the idea that the air-cooled [[radial engine]] would benefit most, because its fins ran hotter than the radiator of a liquid-cooled engine, with the mistake persisting even as late as 1949.&lt;ref name=becker /&gt;

The [[North American P-51 Mustang]], which first flew in 1940, adopted both the Merlin engine and the Meredith principle.&lt;ref&gt;Yenne, Bill: Rockwell: The Heritage of North American. New York: Crescent Books, 1989. Page 49, {{ISBN|0-517-67252-9}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Around this time the Meredith effect also inspired early American work on the aero-thermodynamic duct or [[ramjet]], due to the similarity of their principles of operation.&lt;ref name=becker&gt;Becker, J.; "''The high-speed frontier: Case histories of four NACA programs, 1920-1950''," SP-445, NASA (1980), Chapter 5: High-speed Cowlings, Air Inlets and Outlets, and Internal-Flow Systems: The ramjet investigation. [http://www.hq.nasa.gov/pao/History/SP-445/ch5-5.htm]&lt;/ref&gt;

The Meredith effect was incorporated into the [[AIAA]] award-winning design of the [[Cratus (aircraft)|Cratus]] racing airplane by [[University of Kansas]] aerospace engineering student Samantha Schueler in 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www2.ljworld.com/news/2012/oct/03/lawrence-douglas-county-housing-authority-studying/ |title=Student’s aircraft design wins top honor / LJWorld.com |publisher=.ljworld.com |date=2012-10-03 |accessdate=2014-01-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aiaa.org/Secondary.aspx?id=13682 |title=AIAA Foundation Announces Winners of 2011-2012 Undergraduate Individual Aircraft Design Competition : The American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics |publisher=Aiaa.org |date=2012-09-11 |accessdate=2014-02-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{nihongo|'''Metabolism'''|新陳代謝|shinchintaisha}} was a post-war Japanese architectural movement that fused ideas about architectural [[Megastructures (architecture)|megastructures]] with those of organic biological growth. It had its first international exposure during [[Congrès Internationaux d'Architecture Moderne|CIAM]]'s 1959 meeting and its ideas were tentatively tested by students from [[Kenzo Tange|Kenzo Tange's]] [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology|MIT]] studio.

During the preparation for the 1960 Tōkyō World Design Conference a group of young architects and designers, including [[Kiyonori Kikutake]], [[Kisho Kurokawa]] and [[Fumihiko Maki]] prepared the publication of the Metabolism manifesto. They were influenced by a wide variety of sources including [[Marxism|Marxist]] theories and biological processes. Their manifesto was a series of four essays entitled: Ocean City, Space City, Towards Group Form, and Material and Man, and it also included designs for vast cities that floated on the oceans and plug-in capsule towers that could incorporate organic growth. Although the World Design Conference gave the Metabolists exposure on the international stage their ideas remained largely theoretical.

Some smaller, individual buildings that employed the principles of Metabolism were built and these included Tange's Yamanashi Press and Broadcaster Centre and Kurokawa's [[Nakagin Capsule Tower]]. The greatest concentration of their work was to be found at the [[Expo '70|1970 World Exposition]] in Osaka where Tange was responsible for master planning the whole site whilst Kikutake and Kurokawa designed pavilions. After the [[1973 oil crisis]], the Metabolists turned their attention away from Japan and toward Africa and the Middle East.

==Origins of Metabolism==

The [[Congrès Internationaux d'Architecture Moderne]] (CIAM) was founded in Switzerland in 1928 as an association of architects who wanted to advance modernism into an international setting. During the early 1930s they promoted the idea (based upon new urban patterns in the United States) that urban development should be guided by CIAM's four functional categories of: dwelling, work, transportation, and recreation.&lt;ref name="Mumford 2010, p5"&gt;Mumford (2000), p5&lt;/ref&gt; By the mid-1930s [[Le Corbusier]] and other architects had moulded CIAM into a pseudo-political party with the goal of promoting modern architecture to all. This view gained some traction in the immediate post-war period when Le Corbusier and his colleagues began to design buildings in [[Chandigarh]]. By the early 1950s it was felt that CIAM was losing its avant-garde edge so in 1954 a group of younger members called "[[Team 10]]" was formed. This included the inner circle Dutch architects [[Jaap Bakema|Jacob Bakema]] and [[Aldo van Eyck]], Italian [[Giancarlo De Carlo]], Greek [[Georges Candilis]], the British architects [[Alison and Peter Smithson|Peter and Alison Smithson]] and the American [[Shadrach Woods]]. The Team 10 architects introduced concepts like "human association", "cluster" and "mobility", with Bakema encouraging the combination of architecture and planning in [[urban design]]. This was a rejection of CIAM's older four function mechanical approach and it would ultimately lead to the break-up and end of CIAM.&lt;ref name="Mumford 2010, p6-7"&gt;Mumford (2000), p6-7&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Kenzo Tange]] was invited to the CIAM '59 meeting of the association in Otterlo, Netherlands. In what was to be the last meeting of CIAM he presented two theoretical projects by the architect [[Kiyonori Kikutake]]: the Tower-shaped City and Kikutake's own home, the Sky House. This presentation exposed the fledgling Metabolist movement to its first international audience. Like Team 10's "human association" concepts Metabolism too was exploring new concepts in urban design.&lt;ref name="Lin 2010, p26"&gt;Lin (2010), p. 26&lt;/ref&gt;

Tower-shaped City was a 300 metre tall tower that housed the infrastructure for an entire city. It included transportation, services and a manufacturing plant for prefabricated houses. The tower was vertical "artificial land" onto which steel, pre-fabricated dwelling capsules could be attached. Kikutake proposed that these capsules would undergo self-renewal every fifty years and the city would grow organically like branches of a tree.&lt;ref name="Lin 2010, p26"&gt;Lin (2010), p. 26&lt;/ref&gt;

Constructed on a hillside, the Sky House is a platform supported on four concrete panels with a [[hyperboloid structure|hyperbolic paraboloid]] shell roof. It is a single space divided by storage units with the kitchen and bathroom on the outer edge.&lt;ref name="Watanabe 2001, p123"&gt;Watanabe (2001), p. 123&lt;/ref&gt; These latter two were designed so that they could be moved to suit the use of the house - and indeed they have been moved and/or adjusted about seven times over the course of fifty years. At one point a small children's room was attached to the bottom of main floor with a small child-sized access door between the two rooms.&lt;ref name="Koolhaas 2011, p139"&gt;Koolhaas &amp; Obrist (2011), p. 139&lt;/ref&gt;

After the meeting, Tange left for [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]] to begin a four-month period as a visiting professor. It is possible that based upon the reception of Kikutake's projects in Otterlo he decided to set the fifth year project as a design for a residential community of 25,000 inhabitants to be constructed on the water of Boston Bay.&lt;ref name="Stewart 1987, p177"&gt;Stewart (1987), p177&lt;/ref&gt; Tange felt a natural desire to produce urban designs based upon a new prototype of design, one that could give a more human connection to super-scale cities. He considered the idea of "major" and "minor" city structure and how this could grow in cycles like the trunk and leaves of a tree.&lt;ref name="Riani 1969, p24"&gt;Riani (1969), p. 24&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the seven projects produced by the students was a perfect example of his vision. The project consisted of two primary residential structures each of which was triangular in section. Lateral movement was provided by motorways and monorail, whilst vertical movement from the parking areas was via elevators. There were open spaces within for community centres and every third level there were walkways along which were rows of family houses.&lt;ref name="Riani 1969, p24"&gt;Riani (1969), p. 24&lt;/ref&gt; The project appeared to be based upon Tange's unrealised competition entry for the World Health Organisation headquarters in Geneva&lt;ref name="Stewart 1987, p178"&gt;Stewart (1987), p178&lt;/ref&gt; and both projects paved the way for his later project, "Plan for Tōkyō – 1960". Tange went on to present both the Boston Bay Project and the Tōkyō Plan at the Tōkyō World Design Conference.&lt;ref name="Stewart 1987, p181"&gt;Stewart (1987), p181&lt;/ref&gt;

==Tōkyō World Design Conference, 1960==

The conference had its roots with Isamu Konmochi and Sori Yanagi who were representatives of the Japanese Committee on the 1956 International Design Conference in [[Aspen, Colorado]]. They suggested that rather than a four yearly conference in Aspen there should be a roving conference with Tōkyō as its first setting in 1960.&lt;ref name="Koolhaas 2011, p180"&gt;Koolhaas &amp; Obrist (2011), p. 180&lt;/ref&gt; Three Japanese institutional members were responsible for organising the conference, although after the Japan Industrial Design Association pulled out only the [[Japan Institute of Architects]] and the Japan Association of Advertising Arts were left. In 1958 they formed a preparation committee led by [[Junzo Sakakura]], [[Kunio Maekawa]] and Kenzo Tange. As Tange had just accepted an invitation to be a visiting professor at Massachusetts Institute of Technology he recommended his junior colleague Takashi Asada to replace him in the organisation of the conference programmes.&lt;ref name="Lin 2010, p19"&gt;Lin (2010), p. 19&lt;/ref&gt;

The young Asada invited two friends to help him: the architectural critic and former editor of the magazine Shinkenchiku, [[Noboru Kawazoe]], and [[Kisho Kurokawa]] who was one of Tange's students. In turn these two men scouted for more talented designers to help, including: the architects Masato Otaka and Kiyonori Kikutake and the designers [[Kenji Ekuan]] and Kiyoshi Awazu.&lt;ref name="Koolhaas 2011, p181-182"&gt;Koolhaas &amp; Obrist (2011), p. 181-182&lt;/ref&gt; Kurokawa was selected because he had recently returned from an international student conference in the Soviet Union and was a student of the [[Marxism|Marxist]] architectural theorist [[Uzō Nishiyama]]. Ekuan was asked because of his recent participation in a seminar given by [[Konrad Wachsmann]]&lt;ref name="Goldhagen and Legault 2000, p283-284"&gt;Goldhagen and Legault (2000), p283-284&lt;/ref&gt; (he arrived at the lecture on a [[Yamaha YA-1|YA-1]] motorbike that he had newly designed for [[Yamaha Motor Company|Yamaha]])&lt;ref name="Goldhagen and Legault 2000, p478"&gt;Goldhagen and Legault (2000), p478&lt;/ref&gt; and Otaka was a junior associate of Kunio Maekawa and had just completed the Harumi Apartment Building in Tōkyō Bay. [[Fumihiko Maki]], a former undergraduate student of Tange also joined the group whilst in Tōkyō on a travelling fellowship from the [[Graham Foundation for Advanced Studies in the Fine Arts|Graham Foundation]].&lt;ref name="Lin 2010, p22"&gt;Lin (2010), p. 22&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Koolhaas 2011, p300"&gt;Koolhaas &amp; Obrist (2011), p. 300&lt;/ref&gt;

By day Asada canvassed politicians, business leaders and journalists for ideas, by night he met with his young friends to cultivate ideas. Asada was staying at the Ryugetsu Ryokan in [[Asakusa]], Tōkyō and he used it as a meeting place for progressive scholars, architects and artists. He often invited people from other professions to give talks and one of these was the atomic physicist, [[Taketani Mitsuo|Mitsuo Taketani]]. Taketani was a scholar who was also interested in Marxist theory and he brought this along with his scientific theories to the group. Taketani's three stage methodology for scientific research influenced Kikutake's own three stage theory: ''ka'' (the general system), ''kata'' (the abstract image) and ''katachi'' (the solution as built), which he used to summarise his own design process from a broad vision to a concrete architectural form.&lt;ref name="Lin 2010, p20"&gt;Lin (2010), p. 20&lt;/ref&gt;

The group also searched for architectural solutions to Japan's phenomenal urban expansion brought about by its economic growth and how this could be reconciled with its shortage of usable land. They were inspired by examples of circular growth and renewal found in traditional  Japanese architecture like the [[Ise Shrine]] and [[Katsura Detached Palace]].&lt;ref name="Koolhaas 2011, p185"&gt;Koolhaas &amp; Obrist (2011), p. 185&lt;/ref&gt; They worked in coffee shops and Tōkyō's International House to produce a compilation of their works that they could publish as a manifesto for the conference.&lt;ref name="Koolhaas 2011, p187"&gt;Koolhaas &amp; Obrist (2011), p. 187&lt;/ref&gt;

The conference ran from 11–16 May 1960 and had 227 guests, 84 of whom were international, including the architects [[Louis Kahn]], [[Ralph Erskine (architect)|Ralph Erskine]], [[B. V. Doshi]], [[Jean Prouvé]], [[Paul Rudolph (architect)|Paul Rudolph]] and Peter and Alison Smithson. Japanese participants included Kunio Maekawa, [[Yoshinobu Ashihara]] and [[Kazuo Shinohara]].&lt;ref name="Koolhaas 2011, p190-193"&gt;Koolhaas &amp; Obrist (2011), p. 190-193&lt;/ref&gt;

After his 13 May lecture, Louis Kahn was invited to Kikutake's Sky House and had a long conversation with a number of Japanese architects including the Metabolists. He answered questions until after midnight with Maki acting as translator. Kahn spoke of his universal approach to design and used his own [[Richards Medical Research Laboratories]] as an example of how new design solutions can be reached with new thinking about space and movement. A number of the Metabolists were inspired by this.{{Vague|date=March 2013}}&lt;ref name="Lin 2010, p18"&gt;Lin (2010), p. 18&lt;/ref&gt;

===The Metabolism name===
[[File:Marine City sketch by Kikutake 1958.jpg|thumb|Marine City sketch by Kikutake, 1958]]
Whilst discussing the organic nature of Kikutake's theoretical Marine City project, Kawazoe used the Japanese word ''shinchintaisha'' as being symbolic of the essential exchange of materials and energy between organisms and the exterior world (literally ''[[metabolism]]'' in a biological sense.) The Japanese meaning of the word has a feeling of ''replacement of the old with the new'' and the group further interpreted this to be equivalent to the continuous renewal and organic growth of the city.&lt;ref name="Lin 2010, p22"&gt;Lin (2010), p. 22&lt;/ref&gt; As the conference was to be a world conference, Kawazoe felt that they should use a more universal word and Kikutake looked up the definition of ''shinchintaisha'' in his Japanese-English dictionary. The translation he found was the word ''Metabolism''.&lt;ref name="Koolhaas 2011, p235"&gt;Koolhaas &amp; Obrist (2011), p. 235&lt;/ref&gt;

==The Metabolism manifesto==
[[File:Marinacity466.JPG|thumb|Kikutake used a photo of [[Marina City]] to illustrate the idea of capsules plugged onto a central tower]]
The group's manifesto ''Metabolism: The Proposals for New Urbanism'' was published at the World Design Conference.&lt;ref name="Lin 2010, p23"&gt;Lin (2010), p. 23&lt;/ref&gt; Two thousand copies of the 90 page book were printed and were sold for ¥500 by Kurokawa and Awazu at the entrance to the venue.&lt;ref name="Koolhaas 2011, p185"/&gt; The manifesto opened with the following statement:

{{Quote|''Metabolism is the name of the group, in which each member proposes further designs of our coming world through his concrete designs and illustrations. We regard human society as a vital process - a continuous development from atom to nebula. The reason why we use such a biological word, metabolism, is that we believe design and technology should be a denotation of human society. We are not going to accept metabolism as a natural process, but try to encourage active metabolic development of our society through our proposals.&lt;ref name="Lin 2010, p24"&gt;Lin (2010), p. 24&lt;/ref&gt;''}}

The publication included projects by each member but a third of the document was dedicated to work by Kikutake&lt;ref name="Goldhagen and Legault 2000, p285"&gt;Goldhagen and Legault (2000), p285&lt;/ref&gt; who contributed essays and illustrations on the "Ocean City". Kurokawa contributed "Space City", Kawazoe contributed "Material and Man" and Otaka and Maki wrote "Towards the Group Form".&lt;ref name="Lin 2010, p24"&gt;Lin (2010), p. 24&lt;/ref&gt; Awazu designed the booklet and Kawazoe's wife, Yasuko edited the layout.&lt;ref name="Koolhaas 2011, p206"&gt;Koolhaas &amp; Obrist (2011), p. 206&lt;/ref&gt;

Some of the projects included in the manifesto were subsequently displayed at the Museum of Modern Art's 1960 exhibition entitled ''Visionary Architecture'' and exposed the Japanese architects' work to a much wider international audience.&lt;ref name="Goldhagen and Legault 2000, p279"&gt;Goldhagen and Legault (2000), p279&lt;/ref&gt;

Unlike the more rigid membership structure of Team 10, the Metabolist's saw their movement as having organic form with the members being free to come and go, although the group had cohesion they saw themselves as individuals and their architecture reflected this.&lt;ref name="Koolhaas 2011, p239 &amp; 301"&gt;Koolhaas &amp; Obrist (2011), p. 239 &amp; 301&lt;/ref&gt; This was especially true for Tange who remained a mentor for the group rather than an "official" member.&lt;ref name="Lin 2010, p2"&gt;Lin (2010), p. 2&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ocean City===

Kikutake's Ocean City is the first essay in the pamphlet. It covered his two previously published projects "Tower-shaped City" and "Marine City" and included a new project "Ocean City" that was a combination of the first two. The first two of these projects introduced the Metabolist's idea of "artificial land" as well as "major" and "minor" structure.&lt;ref name="Lin 2010, p25"&gt;Lin (2010), p. 25&lt;/ref&gt; Kawazoe referred to "artificial land" in an article in the magazine ''Kindai Kenchiku'' in April 1960. In responding to the scarcity of land in large and expanding cities he proposed creating "artificial land" that would be composed of concrete slabs, oceans or walls (onto which capsules could be plugged). He said that the creation of this "artificial land" would allow people to use other land in a more natural way.&lt;ref name="Koolhaas 2011, p186"&gt;Koolhaas &amp; Obrist (2011), p. 186&lt;/ref&gt;

For Marine City, Kikutake proposed a city that would float free in the ocean and would be free of ties to a particular nation and therefore free from the threat of war. The artificial ground of the city would house agriculture, industry and entertainment and the residential towers would descend into the ocean to a depth of 200 metres. The city itself was not tied to the land and was free to float across the ocean and grow organically like an organism. Once it became too aged for habitation it would sink itself.&lt;ref name="Lin 2010, p27"&gt;Lin (2010), p. 27&lt;/ref&gt;

Ocean City was a combination of both Tower-shaped City and Marine City. It consisted of two rings that were tangent to one another, with housing on the inner ring and production on the outer one. Administrative buildings were found at the tangent point. The population would have been rigidly controlled at an upper limit of 500,000. Kikutake envisaged that the city would expand by multiplying itself as though it was undergoing cell division. This enforced the Metabolist idea that the expansion of cities could be a biological process.&lt;ref name="Lin 2010, p28"&gt;Lin (2010), p. 238&lt;/ref&gt;

===Space City===

In his essay "Space City", Kurokawa introduced four projects: Neo-Tōkyō Plan, Wall City, Agricultural City and Mushroom-shaped house. In contrast to Tange's linear Tōkyō City Bay Project, Kurokawa's Neo-Tōkyō Plan proposed that Tōkyō be decentralised and organised into cruciform patterns. He arranged Bamboo-shaped Cities along these cruciforms but unlike Kikutake he kept the city towers lower than 31 metres to conform with Tōkyō's building code&lt;ref name="Lin 2010, p28.2"&gt;Lin (2010), p. 28&lt;/ref&gt; (these height limits were not revised until 1968).&lt;ref name="Sorensen 2002, p253"&gt;Sorensen (2002), p. 253&lt;/ref&gt;

The Wall City considered the problem of the ever-expanding distance between the home and the workplace. He proposed a wall-shaped city that could extend indefinitely. Dwellings would be on one side of the wall and workplaces on the other. The wall itself would contain transportation and services.&lt;ref name="Lin 2010, p30"&gt;Lin (2010), p. 30&lt;/ref&gt;

Surviving the [[Typhoon Vera|Ise Bay Typhoon]] in 1959 inspired Kurokawa to design the Agricultural City. It consisted of a grid-like city supported on 4 metre stilts above the ground.&lt;ref name="Koolhaas 2011, p341"&gt;Koolhaas &amp; Obrist (2011), p. 341&lt;/ref&gt; The 500 metres square city sat on concrete slab that placed industry and infrastructure above agriculture and was an attempt to combine rural land and the city into one entity.&lt;ref name="Lin 2010, p30"&gt;Lin (2010), p. 30&lt;/ref&gt; He envisaged that his Mushroom Houses would sprout through the slab of Agriculture City. These houses were shrouded in a mushroom-like cap that was neither wall nor roof that enclosed a tea room and a living space.&lt;ref name="Koolhaas 2011, p341"/&gt;

===Towards the Group Form===

Maki and Otaka's essay on Group Form placed less emphasis on the megastructures of some of the other Metabolists and focused instead on a more flexible form of urban planning&lt;ref name="Koolhaas 2011, p352"&gt;Koolhaas &amp; Obrist (2011), p. 352&lt;/ref&gt; that could better accommodate rapid and unpredictable requirements of the city.&lt;ref name="Lin 2010, p34"&gt;Lin (2010), p. 34&lt;/ref&gt;

Otaka had first thought about the relationship between infrastructure and architecture in his 1949 graduation thesis and he continued to explore ideas about "artificial ground" during his work at Maekawa's office. Likewise, during his travels abroad, Maki was impressed with the grouping and forms of vernacular buildings.&lt;ref name="Lin 2010, p32"&gt;Lin (2010), p. 32&lt;/ref&gt; The project they included to illustrate their ideas was a scheme for the redevelopment of [[Shinjuku station]] which included retail, offices and entertainment on an artificial ground over the station.&lt;ref name="Koolhaas 2011, p352"/&gt; Although Otaka's forms were heavy and sculptural and Maki's were lightweight with large spans, both contained the homogeneous clusters that were associated with group form.&lt;ref name="Lin 2010, p34"&gt;Lin (2010), p. 34&lt;/ref&gt;

===Material and Man===

Kawazoe contributed a brief essay entitled ''I want to be a sea-shell, I want to be a mold, I want to be a spirit''. The essay reflected Japan's cultural anguish after the Second World War and proposed the unity of man and nature.&lt;ref name="Goldhagen and Legault 2000, p286-287"&gt;Goldhagen and Legault (2000), p. 286-287&lt;/ref&gt;

==Plan for Tōkyō, 1960–2025==
[[File:Tokyo Bay Plan by Tange 1960.jpg|thumb|[[Tokyo|Tokyo Bay Plan]], project of the Metabolist and [[Structuralism (architecture)|Structuralist]] movement, 1960 ([[Kenzo Tange]])]]
On 1 January 1961 Kenzo Tange presented his new plan for [[Tokyo Bay|Tōkyō Bay]] (1960) in a 45-minute television programme on [[NHK]].&lt;ref name="Koolhaas 2011, p284-292"&gt;Koolhaas &amp; Obrist (2011), p. 284-292&lt;/ref&gt; The design was a radical plan for the reorganization and expansion of the capital in order to cater for a population beyond 10 million.&lt;ref name="Kulterman 1970, p112"&gt;Kulterman (1970), p. 112&lt;/ref&gt; The design was for a linear city that used a series of nine-kilometre modules that stretched 80&amp;nbsp;km across Tōkyō Bay from [[Ikebukuro]] in the north west to [[Kisarazu, Chiba|Kisarazu]] in the south east. The perimeter of each of the modules was organised into three levels of looping highways, as Tange was adamant that an efficient communication system would be the key to modern living.&lt;ref name="Koolhaas 2011, p284-292"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Kulterman 1970, p112"&gt;Kulterman (1970), p. 112&lt;/ref&gt; The modules themselves were organised into building zones and transport hubs and included office, government administration and retail districts as well as a new Tōkyō train station and highway links to other parts of Tōkyō. Residential areas were to be accommodated on parallel streets that ran perpendicular to the main linear axis and like the Boston Bay project, people would build their own houses within giant A-frame structures.&lt;ref name="Kulterman 1970, p123"&gt;Kulterman (1970), p. 123&lt;/ref&gt;

The project was designed by Tange and other members of his studio at Tōkyō University, including Kurokawa and [[Arata Isozaki]]. Originally it was intended to publish the plan at the World Design Conference (hence its "1960" title) but it was delayed because the same  members were working on the Conference organisation.&lt;ref name="Lin 2010, p144-145"&gt;Lin (2010), p. 144-145&lt;/ref&gt; Tange received interest and support from a number of government agencies but the project was never built.&lt;ref name="Koolhaas 2011, p284-292"/&gt; Tange went on to expand the idea of the linear city in 1964 with the [[Tōkaidō (region)|Tōkaidō]] Megalopolis Plan. This was an ambitious proposal to extend Tōkyō's linear city across the whole of the Tōkaidō region of Japan in order to re-distribute the population.&lt;ref name="Koolhaas 2011, p680"&gt;Koolhaas &amp; Obrist (2011), p. 680&lt;/ref&gt;

Both Kikutake and Kurokawa capitalised on the interest in Tange's 1960 plan by producing their own schemes for Tōkyō. Kikutake's plan incorporated three elements both on the land and the sea and included a looped highway that connected all the [[Prefectures of Japan|prefectures]] around the bay. Unlike Tange however its simple presentation graphics put many people off. Kurokawa's plan consisted of helix-shaped megastructures floating inside cells that extended out across the bay. Although the scheme's more convincing graphics were presented as part of a film the project was not built.&lt;ref name="Koolhaas 2011, p284-292"/&gt;

With Japan's [[Japanese asset price bubble|property boom]] in the 1980s, both Tange and Kurokawa revisited their earlier ideas: Tange with his Tōkyō Plan 1986 and Kurokawa with his New Tōkyō Plan 2025. Both projects used land that had been reclaimed from the sea since the 1960s in combination with floating structures.&lt;ref name="Koolhaas 2011, p284-292"/&gt;

==Selected built projects==

===Yamanashi Press and Broadcaster Centre===

[[File:Yamanashi Culture Chamber.jpg|thumb|The Yamanashi Press and Broadcaster Centre]]
[[File:Shizuoka Press and Broadcasting Center. Ginza, Tokyo..jpg|thumb|Shizuoka Press and Broadcasting Tower]]
[[File:Nakagin.jpg|thumb|Nakagin Capsule Tower]]
[[File:Hillside Terrace A B 2010.jpg|thumb|Hillside Terrace]]

In 1961 Kenzo Tange received a commission from the Yamanashi News Group to design a new office in [[Kōfu, Yamanashi|Kōfu]]. As well as two news firms and a printing company the building needed to incorporate a cafeteria and shops at ground floor level to interface with the adjoining city. It also needed to be flexible in its design to allow future expansion.&lt;ref name="Lin 2010, p179-180"&gt;Lin (2010), p. 179-180&lt;/ref&gt;

Tange organised the spaces of the three firms by function to allow them to share common facilities. He stacked these functions vertically according to need, for example, the printing plant is on the ground floor to facilitate access to the street for loading and transportation. He then took all the service functions including elevators, toilets and pipes and grouped them into 16 reinforced concrete cylindrical towers, each with an equal 5 metre diameter. These he placed on a grid into which he inserted the functional group facilities and offices. These inserted elements were conceived of as containers that were independent of the structure and could be arranged flexibly as required. This conceived flexibility distinguished Tange's design from other architects' designs with open floor offices and service cores – such as Kahn's Richards Medical Research Laboratories. Tange deliberately finished the cylindrical towers at different heights to imply that there was room for vertical expansion.&lt;ref name="Lin 2010, p179-180"&gt;Lin (2010), p. 179-180&lt;/ref&gt;

Although the building was expanded in 1974 as Tange had originally envisioned,&lt;ref name="Koolhaas 2011, p363"&gt;Koolhaas &amp; Obrist (2011), p. 363&lt;/ref&gt; it did not act as a catalyst for the expansion of the building into a megastructure across the rest of the city. The building was criticised for forsaking the human use of the building in preference to the structure and adaptability.&lt;ref name="Lin 2010, p186"&gt;Lin (2010), p. 186&lt;/ref&gt;

===Shizuoka Press and Broadcasting Tower===

In 1966 Tange designed the Shizuoka Press and Broadcasting Tower in the [[Ginza]] district of Tōkyō. This time using only a single core Tange arranged the offices as cantilevered steel and glass boxes. The cantilever is emphasised by punctuating the three storey blocks with a single storey glazed balcony.&lt;ref name="Lin 2010, p188"&gt;Lin (2010), p. 188&lt;/ref&gt; The concrete forms of the building were cast using aluminium [[formwork]] and the aluminium has been left on as a cladding.&lt;ref name="Watanabe 2001, p135"&gt;Watanabe (2001), p. 135&lt;/ref&gt; Although conceived as a "core-type" system that was included in Tange's other city proposals, the tower stands alone and is robbed of other connections.&lt;ref name="Lin 2010, p188"&gt;Lin (2010), p. 188&lt;/ref&gt;

===Nakagin Capsule Tower===

The icon of Metabolism, Kurokawa's [[Nakagin Capsule Tower]] was erected in the Ginza district of Tōkyō in 1972 and completed in just 30 days.&lt;ref name="Koolhaas 2011, p388"&gt;Koolhaas &amp; Obrist (2011), p. 388&lt;/ref&gt; Prefabricated in [[Shiga Prefecture]] in a factory that normally built shipping containers, it is constructed of 140 capsules plugged into two cores that are 11 and 13 stories in height. The capsules contained the latest gadgets of the day and were built to house small offices and [[pied-à-terre|pieds-à-terre]] for Tōkyō [[Salaryman|salarymen]].&lt;ref name="Watanabe 2001, p148-149"&gt;Watanabe (2001), p. 148-149&lt;/ref&gt;

The capsules are constructed of light steel welded trusses covered with steel sheeting mounted onto the reinforced concrete cores. The capsules are 2.5 metres wide and four metres long with a 1.3 metre diameter window at one end. The units originally contained a bed, storage cabinets, a bathroom, a colour television set, clock, refrigerator and air conditioner, although optional extras such as a stereo were available. Although the capsules were designed with [[mass production]] in mind there was never a demand for them.&lt;ref name="Watanabe 2001, p148-149"/&gt; [[Nobuo Abe]], was a senior manager, managing one of the design divisions on the construction of the [[Nakagin Capsule Tower]]

Since 1996 the tower has been listed as an architectural heritage by [[Docomomo International|DoCoMoMo]]. However, in 2007 the residents voted to tear the tower down and build a new 14-storey tower. The tower still stands today and has approximately 15 people living inside. In 2010, the pods that are still safe to live in and not falling apart inside have become a hotel for a mere $30 American a night on average.&lt;ref name="Lin 2010, p233"&gt;Lin (2010), p. 233&lt;/ref&gt; However, as of 2017 many capsules have been renovated and are being used as residential and office spaces, while short-stay renting such as Airbnb or other lodging provisions have been banned by the administration of the building.

===Hillside Terrace, Tōkyō===

After the World Design Conference Maki began to distance himself from Metabolist movement, although his studies in ''Group Form'' continued to be of interest to the Metabolists.&lt;ref name="Lin 2010, p23"&gt;Lin (2010), p. 23&lt;/ref&gt; In 1964 he published a booklet entitled ''Investigations in Collective Form'' in which he investigated three urban forms: Compositional-form, Megastructure and Group Form.&lt;ref name="Lin 2010, p111"&gt;Lin (2010), p. 111&lt;/ref&gt; The Hillside Terrace is a series of projects commissioned by the Asakura family and undertaken in seven phases from 1967 to 1992. It includes residential, office and cultural buildings as well as the Royal Danish Embassy and is situated on both sides of Kyū-Yamate avenue in the [[Daikanyamachō, Shibuya|Daikanyama]] district of Tōkyō.&lt;ref name="Lin 2010, p119"&gt;Lin (2010), p. 119&lt;/ref&gt;

The execution of the designs evolves through the phases with exterior forms becoming more independent of the interior functions and new materials being employed. For example, the first phase has a raised pedestrian deck that gives access to shops and a restaurant and this was designed to be extended in subsequent phases but the idea, along with the original master plan, was discarded in later phases.&lt;ref name="Watanabe 2001, p139"&gt;Watanabe (2001), p. 139&lt;/ref&gt; By the third phase Maki moved away from the Modernist maxim of ''form follows function'' and started to design the building exteriors to better match the immediate environment.&lt;ref name="Watanabe 2001, p157"&gt;Watanabe (2001), p. 157&lt;/ref&gt; The project acted as a catalyst to the redevelopment of the whole area around [[Daikan-yama Station|Daikanyama Station]].&lt;ref name="Watanabe 2001, p139"&gt;Watanabe (2001), p. 139&lt;/ref&gt;

==Metabolism in context==

[[File:Tokyo 1945-3-10-1.jpg|thumb|Tōkyō after bombing, 1945]]

Metabolism developed during the post war period in a Japan that questioned its cultural identity. Initially the group had chosen the name ''Burnt Ash School'' to reflect the ruined state of firebombed Japanese cities and the opportunity they presented for radical re-building. Ideas of nuclear physics and biological growth were linked with [[Buddhism in Japan|Buddhist]] concepts of regeneration.&lt;ref name="Goldhagen and Legault 2000, p287"&gt;Goldhagen and Legault (2000), p. 287&lt;/ref&gt; Although Metabolism rejected visual references from the past,&lt;ref name="Goldhagen and Legault 2000, p289"&gt;Goldhagen and Legault (2000), p. 289&lt;/ref&gt; they embraced concepts of prefabrication and renewal from traditional Japanese architecture, especially the twenty-year cycle of the rebuilding of the [[Ise Grand Shrine|Ise Shrine]] (to which Tange and Kawazoe were invited in 1953). The sacred rocks onto which the shrine is built were seen by the Metabolists as symbolising a Japanese spirit that predated [[Empire of Japan|Imperial]] aspirations and modernising influences from the West.&lt;ref name="Goldhagen and Legault 2000, p290-291"&gt;Goldhagen and Legault (2000), p. 290-292&lt;/ref&gt;

In his ''Investigations in Collective Form'' Maki coined the term ''Megastructure'' to refer structures that house the whole or part of a city in a single structure. He originated the idea from vernacular forms of village architecture that were projected into vast structures with the aid of modern technology. [[Reyner Banham]] borrowed ''Megastructure'' for the title of his 1976 book which contained numerous built and unbuilt projects. He defined ''Megastructures'' as modular units (with a short life span) that attached to structural framework (with a longer life span).&lt;ref name="Lin 2010, p10"&gt;Lin (2010), p. 10&lt;/ref&gt; Maki would later criticise the ''Megastructure'' approach to design advocating instead his idea of ''Group Form'' which he thought would better accommodate the disorder of the city.&lt;ref name="Lin 2010, p11"&gt;Lin (2010), p. 11&lt;/ref&gt;

The architect [[Robin Boyd (architect)|Robin Boyd]] readily interchanges the word Metabolism with [[Archigram]] in his 1968 book ''New Directions in Japanese Architecture''.&lt;ref name="Boyd 1968, p16"&gt;Boyd (1968), p. 16&lt;/ref&gt; Indeed, the two groups both emerged in the 1960s and disbanded in the 1970s and used imagery with megastructures and cells, but their urban and architectural proposals were quite different. Although utopian in their ideals, the Metabolists were concerned with improving the social structure of society with their biologically inspired architecture, whereas Archigram were influenced by mechanics, information and electronic media and their architecture was more utopian and less social.&lt;ref name="Lin 2010, p11"&gt;Lin (2010), p. 11&lt;/ref&gt;

==Osaka Expo, 1970==

[[File:Osaka Expo'70 Festival Plaza.jpg|thumb|The roof of the Festival Plaza, Osaka Expo 1970]]
[[File:EXPO TOWER.JPG|thumb|Kikutake's Expo Tower, Osaka Expo 1970]]
[[File:Toshiba-IHI Pavilion.jpg|thumb|Kurokawa's Toshiba-IHI Pavilion, Osaka Expo 1970]]

Japan was selected as the site for the  [[Expo '70|1970 World Exposition]] and 330 hectares in the Senri Hills in [[Osaka Prefecture]] were set aside as the location.&lt;ref name="Kulterman 1970, p282"&gt;Kulterman (1970), p. 282&lt;/ref&gt; Japan had originally wanted to host a World Exposition in 1940 but it was cancelled with the escalation of the war. The one million people who had bought tickets for 1940 were allowed to use them in 1970.&lt;ref name="Koolhaas 2011, p506-507"&gt;Koolhaas &amp; Obrist (2011), p. 506-507&lt;/ref&gt;

Kenzo Tange joined the Theme Committee for the Expo and along with Uso Nishiyama he had responsibility for master planning the site. The theme for the Expo became "Progress and Harmony for Mankind". Tange invited twelve architects, including [[Arata Isozaki]], Otaka and Kikutake to design individual elements.&lt;ref name="Kulterman 1970, p282"&gt;Kulterman (1970), p. 282&lt;/ref&gt; He also asked Ekuan to oversee the design of the furniture and transportation and Kawazoe to curate the Mid-Air Exhibition which was sited in the huge space-frame roof.&lt;ref name="Koolhaas 2011, p506-507"/&gt;

Tange envisioned that the Expo should be primarily conceived as a big festival where human beings could meet. Central to the site he placed the Festival Plaza onto which were connected a number of themed displays, all of which were united under one huge roof.&lt;ref name="Kulterman 1970, p284"&gt;Kulterman (1970), p. 284&lt;/ref&gt; In his Tōkyō Bay Project Tange spoke about the living body having two types of information transmission systems: fluid and electronic. That project used the idea of a tree trunk and branches that would carry out those types of transmission in relation to the city. Kawazoe likened the [[space frame]] roof of the Festival Plaza to the electronic transmission system and the aerial-themed displays that plugged into it to the hormonal system.&lt;ref name="Tange &amp; Kawazoe, p31"&gt;Tange &amp; Kawazoe (1970), p. 31&lt;/ref&gt;

Kawazoe, Maki and Kurokawa had invited a selection of world architects to design displays for the Mid-Air Exhibition that was to be incorporated within the roof. The architects included [[Moshe Safdie]], [[Yona Friedman]], [[Hans Hollein]] and [[Giancarlo De Carlo]].&lt;ref name="Koolhaas 2011, p516"&gt;Koolhaas &amp; Obrist (2011), p. 516&lt;/ref&gt; Although Tange was obsessed with the theory of flexibility that the space framed provide he did concede that in reality it was not so practical for the actual fixing of the displays.&lt;ref name="Tange &amp; Kawazoe, p31"/&gt; The roof itself was designed by Koji Kamaya and Mamoru Kawaguchi who conceived it as a huge space frame. Kawaguchi invented a welding-free [[ball joint]] to safely distribute the load and worked out a method of assembling the frame on the ground before raising it using [[Jack (device)|jacks]].&lt;ref name="Koolhaas 2011, p511"&gt;Koolhaas &amp; Obrist (2011), p. 511&lt;/ref&gt;

Kikutake's Expo Tower was situated on the highest hill in the grounds and acted as a landmark for visitors. It was built of a vertical ball and joint space onto which was attached a series of cabins. The design was to have been a blueprint for flexible vertical living based upon a 360m3 standard construction cabin clad with a membrane of cast aluminium and glass that could be flexibly arranged anywhere on the tower. This was demonstrated with a variety of cabins that were observation platforms and VIP rooms and one cabin at ground level that became an information booth.&lt;ref name="Kikutake Assocs, p69"&gt;Kikutake Assocs (1970), p. 69&lt;/ref&gt;

Kurokawa had won commissions for two corporate pavilions: the Takara Beautillion and the Toshiba IHI pavilion.&lt;ref name="Koolhaas 2011, p507"&gt;Koolhaas &amp; Obrist (2011), p. 507&lt;/ref&gt; The former of these was composed of capsules plugged onto six point frames and was assembled in just six days; the latter was a space frame composed of tetrahedron modules, based upon his Helix City that could grow in 14 different directions and resemble organic growth.&lt;ref name="Koolhaas 2011, p528-530"&gt;Koolhaas &amp; Obrist (2011), p. 528-530&lt;/ref&gt;

Expo '70 has been described has the apotheosis of the Metabolist movement.&lt;ref name="Koolhaas 2011, p506-507"/&gt; But even before Japan's period of rapid economic growth ended with the [[1973 oil crisis|world energy crisis]], critics were calling the Expo a dystopia that was removed from reality.&lt;ref name="Sasaki, p143"&gt;Sasaki (1970), p. 143&lt;/ref&gt; The energy crisis demonstrated Japan's reliance both on imported oil and led to a re-evaluation of design and planning with architects moving away from utopian projects towards smaller urban interventions.&lt;ref name="Lin 2010, p228"&gt;Lin (2010), p. 228&lt;/ref&gt;

==Later years==

[[File:Model of Aquapolis.JPG|thumb|Model of the Aquapolis, Okinawa Ocean Expo 1975]]
[[File:Kuwait Embassy and Chancellery in Japan.jpg|thumb|Kuwait Embassy and Chancellery of Japan (1970)]]

After the 1970 Expo, Tange and the Metabolists turned their attention away from Japan towards the Middle East and Africa. These countries were expanding on the back of income from oil and were fascinated by both Japanese culture and the expertise that the Metabolists brought to urban planning.&lt;ref name="Koolhaas 2011, p591"&gt;Koolhaas &amp; Obrist (2011), p. 591&lt;/ref&gt; Tange and Kurokawa capitalised on the majority of the commissions, but Kikutake and Maki were involved too.&lt;ref name="Koolhaas 2011, p594-595"&gt;Koolhaas &amp; Obrist (2011), p. 594-595&lt;/ref&gt;

Tange's projects included a 57,000 seat stadium and sports center in [[Riyadh]] for [[Faisal of Saudi Arabia|King Faisal]], and a sports city for [[Kuwait]] for the planned 1974 Pan Arab Games. However, both were put on hold by the outbreak of the [[Yom Kippur War|Fourth Arab-Israeli War]] in 1973. Likewise, the plan for a new city center in [[Tehran]] was cancelled after the [[Iranian Revolution|1979 revolution]]. He did however complete the Kuwaiti Embassy in Tōkyō in 1970 and Kuwait's International Airport.&lt;ref name="Koolhaas 2011, p606-610"&gt;Koolhaas &amp; Obrist (2011), p. 606-610&lt;/ref&gt;

Kurokawa's work included a competition win for [[Abu Dhabi|Abu Dhabi's]] National Theatre (1977), capsule-tower designs for a hotel in [[Baghdad]] (1975) and a city in the desert in [[Libya]] (1979–1984).&lt;ref name="Koolhaas 2011, p620-630"&gt;Koolhaas &amp; Obrist (2011), p. 620-630&lt;/ref&gt;

Kikutake's vision for floating towers was partly realised in 1975 when he designed and built the Aquapolis for the [[Expo '75|Okinawa Ocean Expo]]. The 100 x 100 meter floating city block contained accommodation that included a banquet hall, offices and residences for 40 staff and it was built in [[Hiroshima]] and then towed to [[Okinawa]].&lt;ref name="Koolhaas 2011, p152-153"&gt;Koolhaas &amp; Obrist (2011), p. 152-153&lt;/ref&gt; Further unbuilt floating city projects were undertaken, including a floating city in [[Hawaii]] for ocean research and a plug-in floating A-frame unit containing housing and offices that could have been used to provide mobile homes in the event of a natural disaster.&lt;ref name="Koolhaas 2011, p673-675"&gt;Koolhaas &amp; Obrist (2011), p. 673-675&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Micromonosporaceae''' is  a family of [[bacterium|bacteria]] of the class [[Actinobacteria]]. They are [[gram-positive]], [[spore]]-forming soil organisms that form a true [[mycelium]].

==Phylogeny==
The currently accepted taxonomy is based on the [[List of Prokaryotic names with Standing in Nomenclature]] (LPSN) &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author = J.P.

'''Motion-capture acting''', also called '''performance-capture acting''', sometimes abbreviated as '''MoCap''' or '''Pcap''', is a type of [[acting]] in which an actor wears markers or sensors on a skintight bodysuit&lt;ref&gt; NY Castings, Joe Gatt, [http://www.nycastings.com/dmxreadyv2/blogmanager/v3_blogmanager.asp?post=motioncaptureactors Motion Capture Actors: Body Movement Tells the Story] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140703113656/http://www.nycastings.com/dmxreadyv2/blogmanager/v3_blogmanager.asp?post=motioncaptureactors |date=2014-07-03 }}, Accessed June 21, 2014&lt;/ref&gt; or directly on the skin.&lt;ref name=twsWired&gt; Hugh Hart, January 24, 2012, Wired magazine, [https://www.wired.com/2012/01/andy-serkis-oscars/ When will a motion capture actor win an Oscar?], Accessed June 21, 2014, "...the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences’ historic reluctance to honor motion-capture performances ....."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=twsCalgaryHerald&gt; January 25, 2012, Calgary Herald, [http://blogs.calgaryherald.com/2012/01/25/no-oscar-nod-for-andy-serkis-master-of-stop-motion-acting/ No Oscar nod for Andy Serkis: master of motion-capture acting], Accessed June 21, 2014, "..Serkis has carved out a niche for himself as master of motion-capture roles..."&lt;/ref&gt; Several cameras from different angles record the actor's movements simultaneously, recording the three-dimensional position of the sensors and not recording the rest of the actor. Sampling is done many times each second, aided by advances in computer technology. The resulting database of 3-D points permits a filmmaker or video game creator to create a digital character and to place this character in an entirely new setting, such as on top of a fictional volcano or flying through the air. This type of acting is seen as a growth area, with predictions that there will be more work in future for actors.&lt;ref name="twsBackstage"&gt;Andrew Harris Salomon, Feb. 22, 2013, Backstage Magazine, [http://www.backstage.com/news/spotlight/growth-performance-capture-helping-gaming-actors-weather-slump/ Growth In Performance Capture Helping Gaming Actors Weather Slump], Accessed June 21, 2014, "..motion-capture technology ... indicate that this niche continues to be a growth area for actors...."&lt;/ref&gt; Some theatrical agents represent motion-capture actors.&lt;ref name="twsBackstage" /&gt;

Motion-capture acting can be difficult work. For example, one actor was "placed in a tiny booth, had dots placed all over his face that captured his movements, and had to sit perfectly still".&lt;ref name=twsBackstage/&gt; One report suggested that actors wishing to break into this line of work should go to acting class and become experts in skills such as gunplay, sword fighting, dance, general body movement, running and jumping, gymnastics, and hand-to-hand fighting.&lt;ref name=twsBackstage/&gt; It is a new type of acting work. Numerous sources identify actor [[Andy Serkis]] as the "king of motion-capture acting" based on his work in creating digital characters in movies such as ''[[The Lord of the Rings (film series)|The Lord of the Rings]]'', ''[[King Kong (2005 film)|King Kong]]'' and ''[[Planet of the Apes]]''.&lt;ref name=twsToday&gt; Gael Fashingbauer Cooper, TODAY, May 26, 2014, [http://www.today.com/entertainment/7-summer-movies-you-shouldnt-miss-2D79591396 7 summer movies you shouldn't miss], Accessed June 21, 2014, "....Andy Serkis, the king of motion-capture acting..."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=twsLATimes&gt;Gina McIntyre, June 04, 2014, Los Angeles Times, [http://herocomplex.latimes.com/movies/star-wars-josh-trank-set-to-direct-standalone-film/#/0 ‘Star Wars’: Josh Trank set to direct standalone film], Accessed June 21, 2014, "..Irish actor Domhnall Gleeson, performance capture expert Andy Serkis ..."&lt;/ref&gt; According to one report, the first use of performance capture acting for a video game was for the 2007 game ''[[Heavenly Sword]]'' which starred Serkis and others.&lt;ref name="CBC News"&gt; [http://www.cbc.ca/news/technology/performance-capture-injects-emotion-into-virtual-worlds-1.1104828 Performance capture injects emotion into virtual worlds: Using actors' movements, expressions to animate digital characters in games, film allows audiences to relate], March 7, 2011, Blaine Kyllo, "...Heavenly Sword (2007), which starred Serkis and Anna Torv (Fringe ), was the first video game in which performance capture was used..."&lt;/ref&gt; Serkis said:

There have been battles within the film industry about earning recognition for motion-capture actors. The Alliance of Motion Picture &amp; Television Producers does not consider motion-capture acting as the same type of work as acting, which means that motion-capture actors are often paid less.&lt;ref name=twsVariety/&gt; The [[Screen Actors Guild]] (SAG) has lobbied the industry for better employment terms and conditions for motion-capture actors, and argued that motion-capture work should be included in standard labor contracts.&lt;ref name=twsVariety&gt; Dave McNary, December 17, 2011, Variety magazine, [https://variety.com/2011/digital/news/motion-capture-tests-acting-boundaries-1118047652/ Motion-capture tests acting boundaries], Accessed June 21, 2014, "..The Screen Actors Guild ... are the characters in these films ... performing as genuine actors or something else?..."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt; Dave McNary, December 17, 2011, Variety magazine, [https://variety.com/2011/digital/news/motion-capture-tests-acting-boundaries-1118047652/ Motion-capture tests acting boundaries], Accessed June 21, 2014&lt;/ref&gt; The industry in 2012 did not give awards for motion-capture acting.&lt;ref name=twsHollywood&gt; KELSEA STAHLER, DEC 07, 2012, Hollywood.com, [http://www.hollywood.com/news/movies/45718147/andy-serkis-at-the-hobbit-premiere-gollum-motion-capture-acting-is-just-acting?page=all Andy Serkis at ‘The Hobbit’ Premiere: Gollum Motion Capture Acting Is ‘Just Acting’], Accessed June 21, 2014, "..Some film experts have had trouble categorizing the master motion capture actor, The Hobbit star Andy Serkis, ..."&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''National Centre for Radio Astrophysics''' ('''NCRA''') ([[Hindi]]:राष्ट्रीय रेडियो खगोल भौतिकी केन्द्र) of [[India]] is a premier [[research institution]] in India in the field of [[radio astronomy]] is located in the [[Pune University]] Campus&lt;ref name="address"&gt;[http://www.ncra.tifr.res.in/ncra/contact/ncra-pune NCRA Address]&lt;/ref&gt; (just beside [[IUCAA]]), is part of the [[Tata Institute of Fundamental Research]], [[Mumbai]], India. NCRA has an active [[research]] program in many areas of [[Astronomy]] and [[Astrophysics]], which includes studies of the [[Sun]], [[Interplanetary scintillation]]s, [[pulsar]]s, the [[Interstellar medium]], [[Active galaxies]] and [[Physical cosmology|cosmology]] and particularly in the specialized field of Radio Astronomy and Radio [[instrumentation]]. NCRA also provides exciting opportunities and challenges in [[engineering]] fields such as [[Analogue electronics|Analog]] and [[Digital Electronics]], [[Signal Processing]], [[Antenna (radio)|Antenna]] Design, [[Telecommunication|Communication]] and [[Software Development]]. 
NCRA has set up the [[Giant Metrewave Radio Telescope]] (GMRT), the world's largest [[telescope]] operating at meter [[wavelength]]s located at [[Khodad]], 80&amp;nbsp;km from [[Pune]]. NCRA also operates the [[Ooty Radio Telescope]] (ORT), which is a large Cylindrical Telescope located near [[Udhagamandalam]], India.&lt;ref name="home_page"&gt;[http://www.ncra.tifr.res.in/ncra NCRA Website Home Page]&lt;/ref&gt;

{{coord|19.10000|74.05000|type:edu_source:USNO/HMNAO|display=title}}

==History==
The Centre has its roots in the [[Radio Astronomy]] Group of [[TIFR]], set up in the early 1960s under the leadership of [[Govind Swarup]]. The group designed and built the Ooty Radio Telescope. In the early 80's an ambitious plan for a new telescope was proposed - the Giant Metrewave Radio Telescope. Since the site chosen for this new telescope was close to Pune, a new home for the group was built in the scenic campus of Pune University. The radio astronomy group morphed into the National Centre for Radio Astrophysics around this time.&lt;ref name="hist"&gt;[http://www.ncra.tifr.res.in/ncra/ncra1/history A brief history of NCRA] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140913032757/http://www.ncra.tifr.res.in/ncra/ncra1/history |date=13 September 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Research==
The National Centre for Radio Astrophysics of the [[Tata Institute of Fundamental Research]] (NCRA-TIFR) is the premier institute for radio astronomy in India, and one of the best in this field in the world. Research activities at NCRA-TIFR are centered on low frequency radio astronomy, with research in a wide range of areas, including [[solar physics]], [[pulsars]], [[active galactic nuclei]], the interstellar medium, [[supernova remnants]], the [[Galactic Centre]], nearby [[galaxies]], high-[[redshift]] galaxies, Fundamental Constant Evolution, and the [[epoch of reionization]].  NCRA-TIFR has built and operates the largest steerable [[radio telescope]] in the world, the Giant Metrewave Radio Telescope, as well as the Ooty Radio Telescope, and work at the frontiers of astronomy and astrophysics, as well as in instrumentation development.&lt;ref name="ncra_research"&gt;[http://www.ncra.tifr.res.in/ncra/research/research-at-ncra-tifr-1 NCRA Research Areas]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="details_research"&gt;[http://www.ncra.tifr.res.in/ncra/research A Details Description of NCRA Research Areas]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Research Facilities==
Research facilities of NCRA includes a well-furnished Library both at NCRA and GMRT, Computing Facilities, Radio Physics Laboratory(A joint initiative of NCRA-TIFR and IUCAA) and above all two radio telescopes GMRT and ORT.

===[[Giant Metrewave Radio Telescope]] (GMRT)===
NCRA has set up a unique facility for radio astronomical research using the metrewavelengths range of the [[Radio wave|radio spectrum]], known as the Giant Metrewave Radio Telescope (GMRT), it is located at a site about 80&amp;nbsp;km north of Pune. GMRT consists of 30 fully steerable gigantic parabolic dishes of 45m diameter each spread over distances of up to 25&amp;nbsp;km. GMRT is one of the most challenging experimental programmes in basic sciences undertaken by Indian scientists and engineers. GMRT is a unique instrument which opens up the [[sky]] at the Metrewave range of the [[Electromagnetic spectrum]] and using the technique of [[Aperture synthesis]] allows to make high sensitive maps of the sky.&lt;ref name="gmrt"&gt;[http://www.ncra.tifr.res.in/ncra/gmrt/about-gmrt/introducing-gmrt-1 Introducing GMRT]&lt;/ref&gt; The instrument is at par with other radio telescopes in the world like the [[Very Large Array|VLA]] in terms of resolution. It complements VLA at the metre-wavelengths.

===[[Ooty Radio Telescope]] (ORT)===
The Ooty Radio Telescope (ORT, as it is known) is a [[cylindrical]] [[paraboloid]] of reflecting surface, 530 m long and 30 m wide, placed on a hill whose slope of about 11 degree in the north-south direction which is the same as the latitude of the location of ORT. This makes it possible to track [[celestial objects]] for about 10 hours continuously from their rising in east to their setting in the west by simply rotating the antenna mechanically along its long axis.The telescope is operated at 326.5&amp;nbsp;MHz (a [[wavelength]] of 0.92 m) with 15&amp;nbsp;MHz usable [[bandwidth (signal processing)|bandwidth]]. The large size of the telescope makes it highly sensitive. It has been designed and fabricated fully indigenously.&lt;ref name="ort"&gt;[http://rac.ncra.tifr.res.in/ort.html Radio Astronomy Centre, Ooty]&lt;/ref&gt;

===[http://www.ncra.tifr.res.in/rpl Radio Physics Laboratory]===
[http://www.ncra.tifr.res.in/rpl Radio Physics Laboratory]([http://www.ncra.tifr.res.in/rpl RPL]) is a joint initiative of National Centre for Radio Astrophysics (NCRA-TIFR) and [[Inter-University Centre for Astronomy and Astrophysics]] (IUCAA). It has set up several [[radio antenna]]s in the campus itself. These contain 3-metre and 4-metre radio antennas as well as the construction of a 15-metre antenna in progress. RPL conducts a variety of student training programs including two major annual all India programs - Radio Astronomy Winter School for College students (RAWSC) and Pulsar Observing for Students (POS).&lt;ref name="rpl"&gt;[http://www.ncra.tifr.res.in/rpl Radio Physics Laboratory]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Side view of tropaeolum majus.jpg|thumb|Side view of ''Tropaeolum majus'', a plant with a nectar spur arising from the hypanthium of the flower.]]
A '''nectar spur''' is a hollow extension of a part of a flower. The spur may arise from various parts of the flower: the [[sepal]]s, [[petal]]s, or [[hypanthium]], and often contain tissues that secrete nectar [[Nectar|(nectaries]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Antoń|first=Sebastian|last2=Kamińska|first2=Magdalena|date=2015-11-01|title=Comparative floral spur anatomy and nectar secretion in four representatives of Ranunculaceae|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00709-015-0794-5|journal=Protoplasma|language=en|volume=252|issue=6|pages=1587–1601|doi=10.1007/s00709-015-0794-5|issn=0033-183X|pmc=4628095|pmid=25772682}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Nectar spurs are present in many clades across the [[Flowering plant|angiosperms]], and are often cited as an example of [[List of examples of convergent evolution|convergent evolution]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Taxonomic significance ==
[[File:Wallacesesquipedale.jpg|thumb|The long tongue of a sphinx moth is depicted as reaching into the equally long-spurred orchid.]]
Spur length can be an important diagnostic character for taxonomy, useful in species identification. For example, [[Yadon's piperia]] cannot be easily distinguished from other ''[[Piperia]]'' ([[Orchidaceae]]) save for the unusually short length of its spur.&lt;ref&gt;Morgan &amp; Ackerman, Lindleyana 5:205–211 (1990)&lt;/ref&gt;

== Ecology and evolution ==
The presence of nectar spurs in a clade of plants is associated with evolutionary processes such as [[coevolution]] (two-sided evolution) and [[pollinator]] shifts (one-sided evolution).&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://evolution-outreach.springeropen.com/|title=Evolution: Education and Outreach|website=Evolution: Education and Outreach|doi=10.1007/s12052-009-0192-6|access-date=2017-04-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; Like variations in floral tube length, variation in nectar spur length has been associated with variation in the lengths of organs on the primary pollinators of the plants, whether being the tongues of moths, the proboscis of flies, or the beaks of hummingbirds.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; This variation in floral shape can restrict access of pollinators to nectar, limiting the range of potential pollinators.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Whittall|first=Justen B.|last2=Hodges|first2=Scott A.|title=Pollinator shifts drive increasingly long nectar spurs in columbine flowers|url=http://www.nature.com/doifinder/10.1038/nature05857|journal=Nature|volume=447|issue=7145|pages=706–709|doi=10.1038/nature05857}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a famous historical story, [[Charles Darwin|Darwin]] predicted that the ''[[Angraecum sesquipedale]]'', an orchid with an extremely long spur, must be pollinated by a pollinator with an equally long tongue.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=On the Various Contrivances by which British and Foreign Orchids are Fertilized by Insects, facsimile edn.|last=Darwin|first=Charles R.|publisher=|year=1862|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The pollinator, the [[sphinx moth]] [[Xanthopan morganii|''Xanthopan morganii'' ''praedicta'']], was found and described 40 years after Darwin made his prediction.

Nectar spurs have been cited as prime examples of “[[key innovation]]s” that may promote diversification, and play a part in the [[adaptive radiation]] of clades.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; [[Columbines]] (''Aquilegia'') have been studied in depth for the link between their floral nectar spurs and their rapid evolutionary radiations.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hodges|first=Scott A.|year=1997|title=Floral Nectar Spurs and Diversification|jstor=2475168|journal=International Journal of Plant Sciences|volume=158.

In terms of development, the varying lengths of nectar spurs has been found to be based solely on the [[Anisotropy|anisotropic]] elongation of cells.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Puzey|first=Joshua R.|last2=Gerbode|first2=Sharon J.|last3=Hodges|first3=Scott A.|last4=Kramer|first4=Elena M.|last5=Mahadevan|first5=L.|date=2012-04-22|title=Evolution of spur-length diversity in Aquilegia petals is achieved solely through cell-shape anisotropy|url=http://rspb.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/279/1733/1640|journal=Proceedings of the Royal Society of London B: Biological Sciences|language=en|volume=279|issue=1733|pages=1640–1645|doi=10.1098/rspb.2011.1873|issn=0962-8452|pmc=3282339|pmid=22090381}}&lt;/ref&gt;  However, it still remains to be understood which genes underlie the elongation of cells to form a spur. Are the same genes being co-opted over and over again across the angiosperms to form spurs, or are there several developmental pathways to make a spur?

The genetic basis underlying the development of nectar spurs has been explored in several clades of plant families, such as ''[[Linaria]]'' and ''Aquilegia''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Glover|first=Beverley J.|last2=Airoldi|first2=Chiara A.|last3=Brockington|first3=Samuel F.|last4=Fernández-Mazuecos|first4=Mario|last5=Martínez-Pérez|first5=Cecilia|last6=Mellers|first6=Greg|last7=Moyroud|first7=Edwige|last8=Taylor|first8=Lin|date=2015-05-01|title=How Have Advances in Comparative Floral Development Influenced Our Understanding of Floral Evolution?|url=http://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/10.1086/681562|journal=International Journal of Plant Sciences|volume=176|issue=4|pages=307–323|doi=10.1086/681562|issn=1058-5893}}&lt;/ref&gt; Studies in model plant ''[[Antirrhinum majus|Antirrhinum]]'' and [[Arabidopsis thaliana|''Arabidopsis'']] identified that type I [[Homeobox|KNOX]] SHOOTMERISTEMLESS (STM) genes play a role in the development of spur-like structures.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Golz|first=John F.|last2=Keck|first2=Emma J.|last3=Hudson|first3=Andrew|date=2002-04-02|title=Spontaneous mutations in KNOX genes give rise to a novel floral structure in Antirrhinum|journal=Current Biology|volume=12|issue=7|pages=515–522|issn=0960-9822|pmid=11937019}}&lt;/ref&gt; These type I KNOX STM genes also play important roles in the development of the growing tip of the plant, the [[Meristem|shoot apical meristem]], by controlling cell division and prolonging indeterminate growth.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Barton|first=M.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9853">'''Optimal virulence''' is a concept relating to the [[ecology]] of hosts and [[parasite]]s. One definition of [[virulence]] is the host's parasite-induced loss of [[fitness (biology)|fitness]]. The parasite's fitness is determined by its success in transmitting offsprings to other hosts. At one time, the consensus was that over time, virulence moderated and parasitic relationships evolved toward symbiosis. This view has been challenged. A [[pathogen]] that is too restrained will lose out in competition to a more aggressive strain that diverts more host resources to its own reproduction.  However, the host, being the parasite's resource and habitat in a way, suffers from this higher [[virulence]]. This might induce faster host death, and act against the parasite's fitness by reducing probability to encounter another host (killing the host too fast to allow for transmission). Thus, there is a natural force providing pressure on the parasite to "self-limit" virulence. 
The idea is, then, that there exists an equilibrium point of virulence, where parasite's fitness is highest. Any movement on the virulence axis, towards higher or lower virulence, will result in lower fitness for the parasite, and thus will be selected against.

==Mode of transmission==

According to [[evolutionary medicine]], virulence increases with [[horizontal transmission]] (between non-relatives) and decreases with [[vertical transmission]] (from parent to child).[https://www.jstor.org/stable/10.1086/286159]

[[Paul W. Ewald]]  has explored the relationship between virulence and mode of transmission. He came to the conclusion that virulence tends to remain especially high in waterborne and vector-borne infections, such as [[cholera]] and [[Dengue]]. Cholera is spread through sewage and Dengue through [[mosquito]]s. In the case of respiratory infections, the pathogen depends on an ambulatory host to survive. It must spare the host long enough to find a new host. Water- or vector-borne transmission circumvents the need for a mobile host.   Ewald is convinced that the crowding of [[trench warfare]] provided an easy route to transmission that explains the virulence of the [[Spanish flu|1918 influenza pandemic]]. In crowded conditions the time to find a new host is minimal.

Other [[epidemiologist]]s have expanded on the idea of a tradeoff between costs and benefits of virulence. One factor is the time or distance between potential hosts. Airplane travel, crowded [[factory farms]] and [[urbanization]] have all been suggested as possible sources of virulence. Another factor is the presence of multiple infections in a single host leading to increased competition among pathogens. In this scenario, the host can survive only as long as it resists the most virulent strains. The advantage of a low virulence strategy becomes moot.   Multiple infections can also result in gene swapping among pathogens, increasing the likelihood of lethal combinations.

==Evolutionary hypotheses==
There are three main hypotheses about why a pathogen evolves as it does. These three models help to explain the [[life history theory|life history strategies]] of parasites, including reproduction, migration within the host, virulence, etc.  The three hypotheses are the '''Trade-Off Hypothesis''', the '''Short-Sighted Evolution Hypothesis''', and the '''Coincidental Evolution Hypothesis'''. All of these offer [[ultimate causes|ultimate]] explanations for virulence in pathogens.

===Trade-off hypothesis===
At one time, some biologists argued that pathogens would tend to evolve toward ever decreasing virulence because the death of the host (or even serious disability) is ultimately harmful to the pathogen living inside. For example, if the host dies, the pathogen population inside may die out entirely. Therefore, it was believed that less virulent pathogens that allowed the host to move around and interact with other hosts should have greater success reproducing and dispersing.

But this is not necessarily the case. Pathogen strains that kill the host can increase in frequency as long as the pathogen can transmit itself to a new host, whether before or after the host dies. The evolution of virulence in pathogens is a balance between the costs and benefits of virulence to the pathogen.  For example, Mackinnon and Read (2004)&lt;ref name ="Mackinnon and Read 2004"&gt;{{Cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt; studied the malaria parasite using a rodent and chicken model respectively and found that there was trade-off between transmission success and virulence as defined by host mortality.

===Short-sighted evolution hypothesis===
Short-sighted evolution suggests that the traits that increase reproduction rate and transmission to a new host will rise to high frequency within the pathogen population. These traits include the ability to reproduce sooner, reproduce faster, reproduce in higher numbers, live longer, survive against antibodies, or survive in parts of the body the pathogen does not normally infiltrate. These traits typically arise due to mutations, which occur more frequently in pathogen populations than in host populations, due to the pathogens' rapid generation time and immense numbers. After only a few generations, the mutations that enhance rapid reproduction or dispersal will increase in frequency. The same mutations that enhance the reproduction and dispersal of the pathogen also enhance its virulence in the host, causing much harm (disease and death). If the pathogen's virulence kills the host and interferes with its own transmission to a new host, virulence will be selected against. But as long as transmission continues despite the virulence, virulent pathogens will have the advantage. So, for example, virulence often increases within families, where transmission from one host to the next is likely, no matter how sick the host. Similarly, in crowded conditions such as refugee camps, virulence tends to increase over time since new hosts cannot escape the likelihood of infection.

===Coincidental evolution hypothesis===
Some forms of pathogenic virulence did not co-evolve with the host. For example, [[tetanus]] is caused by the soil bacterium ''[[Clostridium tetani]]''. After ''C. tetani'' bacteria enter a human wound, the bacteria may grow and divide rapidly, even though the human body is not their normal habitat.  While dividing, ''C. tetani'' produce a neurotoxin that is lethal to humans. But it is selection in the bacterium's normal life cycle in the soil that leads it to produce this toxin, not any evolution with a human host. The bacterium finds itself inside a human instead of in the soil by mere [[wikt:happenstance|happenstance]]. We can say that the neurotoxin is not directed at the human host.

More generally, the virulence of many pathogens in humans may not be a target of selection itself, but rather an accidental by-product of selection that operates on other traits, as is the case with [[antagonistic pleiotropy]]

==Expansion into new environments==
A potential for virulence exists whenever a pathogen invades a new environment, host or tissue.  The new host is likely to be poorly adapted to the intruder, either because it has not built up an immunological defense or because of a fortuitous vulnerability.  In times of change, natural selection favors mutations that exploit the new host more effectively than the founder strain, providing an opportunity for virulence to erupt.

==Host susceptibility== 
Host susceptibility contributes to virulence.  Once transmission occurs, the pathogen must establish an infection to continue. The more competent the host immune system, the less chance there is for the parasite to survive. It may require multiple transmission events to find a suitably vulnerable host. During this time, the invader is dependent upon the survival of its current host. For this reason virulence thrives in a community with prevalent [[immune]] dysfunction and poor nutrition. Virulence weakens in a healthy population and as hosts acquire resistance. Good [[hygiene]], [[nutrition]] and [[sanitation]] are all effective strategies against virulence.

'''''Organised Sound''''' is an international peer-reviewed [[academic journal]] which focuses on the rapidly developing methods and issues arising from the use of technology in music today. Published three times a year, it concentrates upon the impact which the application of technology is having upon music in a variety of genres, including [[sound art]],  [[sound sculpture]] and music ranging from popular idioms to experimental [[Electroacoustic music|electroacoustic]] composition. It thus provides a forum for those interested in electroacoustic music studies, its creation and related developments to share the results of their research as they affect musical issues. Whilst an accompanying CD/CD-ROM/DVD is sent to subscribers annually all media content is or will soon also be available online.

''Organised Sound'' was founded in 1996.  Its editor, [[Leigh Landy]] ([[De Montfort University]], Leicester, UK), is assisted by a diverse range of associated and regional editors.

It depicts six rulers standing in two rows of three.{{sfn|Fowden|2004|p=198}}{{sfn|Drayson|2006|p=117}} Four of the six have inscriptions in [[Arabic]] and [[Greek language|Greek]] identifying them as the [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine]] emperor, King [[Roderic]] of [[Hispania]], the [[Sasanian Empire|Sasanian]] emperor, and the [[Negus]] of [[Kingdom of Aksum|Aksum]].&lt;ref name="met"&gt;{{harvnb|Williams|2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Drayson|2006|p=117}}{{sfn|Fowden|2004|p=205}} The painting, now substantially damaged, is thought to be from between 710 and 750,{{sfn|Drayson|2006|p=121}} commissioned by the Umayyad [[caliphate|caliph]] or someone in his family.{{sfn|Grabar|1954|p=187}} It is one of the most famous frescoes in the Qasr Amra complex.{{sfn|Fowden|2004|p=197}}

[[File:AloisMusil1901.jpg|thumb|right|150px|Alois Musil, the first Westerner who encountered the painting.{{sfn|Khouri|1990}}]]
The painting is located in [[Qasr Amra]] (also transcribed "Quseir Amra", literally "little palace of Amra"), an Umayyad desert structure and a [[UNESCO]] [[World Heritage Site]]&lt;ref name=unesco&gt;{{cite web|title=Quseir Amra|url=http://whc.unesco.org/en/list/327|author=UNESCO|work=World Heritage List}}&lt;/ref&gt; about {{convert|85|km|mi}} east of [[Amman]] and {{convert|21|km|mi}} southwest of the [[Azraq Wetland Reserve]], [[Jordan]].{{sfn|Khouri|1990}} The complex has several frescoes painted on its walls.{{sfn|Khouri|1990}} The remoteness and size of the structure suggest that it served as a desert retreat for Umayyad rulers at the time.{{sfn|Drayson|2006|p=117}}

The painting is on the southern end of the west portion of the main wall.{{sfn|Fowden|2004|p=197}}{{sfn|Drayson|2006|p=117}} Along with other works in the complex, it was cleaned and preserved in the 1970s by a team from the [[National Archaeological Museum of Spain]].{{sfn|Khouri|1990}}

Historian Elizabeth Drayson estimated the earliest possible date for the painting to be 710, the year of the accession of Roderic{{snd}}one of the kings portrayed in the painting{{snd}}and the latest to be 750, the year of [[Abbasid Revolution]] that overthrew the Umayyads.{{sfn|Drayson|2006|p=121}} The artist who painted the fresco is unknown. The patron who commissioned the building, including the painting, was likely one of the caliphs [[al-Walid I]] (reigned 705–715), [[al-Walid II]] ({{r.}}{{nbsp}}743–744) or [[Yazid III]] ({{r.}}{{nbsp}}744).{{sfn|Baker|1980}} It might have been commissioned after the patron became caliph, or before, when the patron was a member of the caliph's family and held the position of governor or heir.{{sfn|Baker|1980}}

The complex, long familiar to local nomads, was discovered (to the West) by the Czech scholar [[Alois Musil]] in 1898.{{sfn|Khouri|1990}} Musil and his companion, Austrian artist [[Alphons Leopold Mielich]], tried to remove the painting from the site, causing permanent damage.{{sfn|Fowden|2004|p=198}} A fragment of the painting, containing labels and partial crowns of two of the figures, is now in the {{Interlanguage link multi|Museum of Islamic Art (Berlin)|de|3=Museum für Islamische Kunst (Berlin)|lt=Museum of Islamic Art}}, [[Berlin]].{{sfn|Fowden|2004|p=12}}{{sfn|Fowden|2004|p=203}}&lt;ref&gt;Museum für Islamische Kunst, Berlin, inv. no. I.1265&lt;/ref&gt;

Musil's 1907 publication ''Kusejr 'Amra''{{sfn|Musil|1907}} included a [[tracing (art)|tracing]] made by Mielich on the spot, Musil's interpretative copy made on the spot, Mielich's later reproduction, and Mielich's written description of the painting.{{sfn|Fowden|2004|p=12}}{{sfn|Fowden|2004|pp=203–204}} This publication included their observations made before much of the damage to the painting was done.{{sfn|Drayson|2006|p=117}}{{sfn|Fowden|2004|p=204}}

==Description==
[[File:Amra5.jpg|thumb|right|150px|A 1907 reproduction of the damaged painting&lt;ref name="met"/&gt;]]
The painting is badly damaged, partly due to the efforts by Alois Musil to remove it.{{sfn|Fowden|2004|p=198}} Large portions of the figures and their garments are not clearly visible. There are six rulers, or kings, standing facing the viewer in two rows of three.{{sfn|Fowden|2004|p=198}}{{sfn|Drayson|2006|p=117}} Each king stretches out both hands with palms turned upwards. Inscriptions in Greek and Arabic above four of the figures, written in white letters on a blue background,{{sfn|Fowden|2004|p=203}} identify them as:&lt;ref name="met"/&gt;{{sfn|Drayson|2006|p=117}}
* ''Kaisar''/''Qaysar'' ("[[Caesar (title)|Caesar]]"), the Byzantine emperor, face not visible, wearing imperial robes and tiara,{{sfn|Fowden|2004|p=204}}{{sfn|Drayson|2006|p=117}} 
* ''Rodorikos''/''Ludhriq'', [[Roderic]], the [[Visigoths|Visigothic]] king of Hispania, barely visible, except for the tip of his helmet and robes,{{sfn|Fowden|2004|p=204}}{{sfn|Drayson|2006|p=117}}
* [[Khosrow (word)|''Khosroes''/''Kisra'']], the Sasanian emperor, appearing young with curly hair, wearing a crown, a cloak, and shoes,{{sfn|Fowden|2004|pp=204–205}}{{sfn|Drayson|2006|p=117}} and
* ''[[Armah|Najashi]]'', the Negus of the Kingdom of Aksum, in a light garment with red [[stole (shawl)|stole]].{{sfn|Fowden|2004|p=205}}{{sfn|Drayson|2006|p=117}}

The labels were already fragile when Musil found it, and many of the labels were lost when he and Mielich tried to clean the painting and remove it from the site.{{sfn|Fowden|2004|p=203}} However, Musil's 1907 publication provided his reproduction of the labels before the damage.{{sfn|Fowden|2004|p=204}} Apart from the four rulers, no identification remains visible for the other two rulers. Possible identities speculated for them include the [[emperor of China]],&lt;ref name="met"/&gt; a [[Khan (title)|Turkic leader]],&lt;ref name="met"/&gt; and an Indian ruler.{{sfn|Drayson|2006|p=117}}

Alongside the painting of the six kings, on the same wall, is a painting of a woman with the Greek word [[Nike (mythology)|ΝΙΚΗ]] ''Nikē'' "Victory" above her.{{sfn|Baker|1980}}{{sfn|Drayson|2006|p=119}} Opposite the painting, towards which the six rulers are gesturing, is a painting of a man seated on a throne. Above this man is an inscription containing a blessing on a person whose name is now invisible.{{sfn|Drayson|2006|p=119}}

==Interpretation==
The intent and meaning of the painting are unclear, and disputed by scholars.{{sfn|Grabar|1954|p=185}} The highly diverse interpretations of the painting are partly due to the loss of information from the damage.{{sfn|Drayson|2006|p=117}}

According to Islamic art consultant Patricia Baker, the [[Greek language|Greek]] word for "victory" appearing nearby suggests that the image was meant to suggest the caliph's supremacy over his enemies.{{sfn|Baker|1980}} Betsy Williams of the [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]] suggested that the six figures are depicted in supplication, presumably towards the caliph who would be seated in the hall.&lt;ref name="met"/&gt; Other scholars, including Arabic [[epigraphist]] [[Max van Berchem]] and architectural historian [[K. A. C. Creswell]], argued that the six rulers are a representation of the defeated enemies of Islam.{{sfn|Grabar|1954|p=185}} [[Iranologist]] and archaeologist [[Ernst Herzfeld]] argued that the painting is an Umayyad copy or version of the Sassanian "Kings of the Earth" located at [[Kermanshah]], as recorded by [[Yaqut al-Hamawi]] in his work ''[[Mu'jam al-Buldan]]'' (''Dictionary of Countries'').{{sfn|Grabar|1954|p=185}} Art historian [[Oleg Grabar]] interpreted the painting as an attempt to convey the idea that the Umayyad dynasty was the descendant and heir of the dynasties it had defeated.{{sfn|Drayson|2006|p=121}}{{sfn|Grabar|1954}}

'''Paleovirology''' is the study of viruses that existed in the past but are now extinct. In general, viruses cannot leave behind physical fossils,&lt;ref name=silica&gt;[http://online.liebertpub.com/doi/abs/10.1089/ast.2010.0463 Laidler J.R., Stedman K.M. "Virus Silicification under Simulated Hot Spring Conditions" ] "Astrobiology", August 2010, 10(6):569-576.' {{doi|10.1089/ast.2010.0463}}&lt;/ref&gt; therefore indirect evidence is used to reconstruct the past. For example, viruses can cause evolution of their hosts, and the signatures of that evolution can be found and interpreted in the present day.&lt;ref name=paleovirology&gt;[http://www.plosbiology.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pbio.1000301 Emerman M., Malik H.S.  "Paleovirology — Modern Consequences of Ancient Viruses".] ''[[PLoS Biology]]'', 8(2)2010 {{doi|10.1371/journal.pbio.1000301}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also, some viral genetic fragments which were integrated into [[germline]] cells of an ancient organism have been passed down to our time as ''viral fossils'',&lt;ref name=paleovirology/&gt; or [[endogenous viral element]]s ('''EVE'''s).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Katzourakis|first=Aris|author2=Gifford, Robert J.|title=Endogenous Viral Elements in Animal Genomes|journal=PLoS Genetics|date=18 November 2010|volume=6|issue=11|pages=e1001191|doi=10.1371/journal.pgen.1001191|pmid=21124940|pmc=2987831}}&lt;/ref&gt; EVEs that originate from the integration of [[retroviruses]] are known as [[endogenous retroviruses]], or ERVs,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Weiss|first=RA|title=The discovery of endogenous retroviruses.|journal=Retrovirology|date=Oct 3, 2006|volume=3|pages=67|pmid=17018135|doi=10.1186/1742-4690-3-67|pmc=1617120}}&lt;/ref&gt; and most viral fossils are ERVs. They may preserve genetic code from millions of years go, hence the "fossil" terminology, although no one has detected a virus in mineral [[fossil]]s.&lt;ref name="paleovirology"/&gt; The most surprising viral fossils originate from non-retroviral [[DNA virus|DNA]] and [[RNA virus]]es.

==Terminology==

Although there is no formal classification system for EVEs, they are categorised according to the taxonomy of their viral origin. Indeed, all known viral genome types and replication strategies, as defined by the [[Baltimore classification]], have been found in the genomic fossil record.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0042682215000549 | title=Endogenous viruses: Connecting recent and ancient viral evolution | author=Pakorn Aiewsakun, Aris Katzourakis | journal=J.

'''EVE''': [[Endogenous viral element]]

'''NIRV''': Non-retroviral Integrated RNA Virus

'''ERV''': [[Endogenous retrovirus]]

'''HERV''': [[Endogenous retrovirus#Human endogenous retroviruses|Human Endogenous Retrovirus]]

Other viral fossils originate from DNA viruses such as [[hepadnavirus]]es (a group that includes [[hepatitis B]]).&lt;ref name=harmon&gt;[http://www.scientificamerican.com/article.cfm?id=fossil-virus-bird-genome "Ancient "Fossil" Virus Shows Infection to Be Millions of Years Old"], by Katherine Harmon, ''[[Scientific American]],'' September 29, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

Viral fossils originating from non-retroviral RNA viruses have been termed [[Non-retroviral Integrated RNA Virus]]es or NIRVs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Taylor|first=D. J.|author2=J. Bruenn|title=The evolution of novel fungal genes from non-retroviral RNA viruses|journal=BMC Biology|year=2009|volume=7|doi=10.1186/1741-7007-7-88|pages=88}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Koonin|first=E.|title=Taming of the shrewd: novel eukaryotic genes from RNA viruses|journal=BMC Biology|year=2010|volume=8|doi=10.1186/1741-7007-8-2|pages=2}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Unlike other types of viral fossils, NIRV formation requires borrowing the integration machinery that is coded by the host genome or by a co-infecting retrovirus.

==Resurrection==

Successful attempts to "resurrect" extinct viruses from the DNA fossils have been reported.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.scientificamerican.com/article.cfm?id=how-to-resurrect-an-extin "How to Resurrect an Extinct Retrovirus"], ''[[Scientific American]],'' November 2, 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="34351">'''Romanesque Revival architecture''', '''Norman Revival architecture''' or '''Neo-Norman''' styles of building were inspired by the [[Romanesque Architecture]] of the 11th and 12th centuries AD.
[[File:WiltonChurch.jpg|thumb|300px|Church of SS Mary and Nicholas, Wilton, Wiltshire, by TH Wyatt, 1841–4]]
In the United Kingdom it started to appear as an architectural style in the 18th. century but reached its greatest popularity in the mid to latter years of the 19th. century. The style can be viewed as a strand of [[Gothic Revival architecture]] and part of the [[Historicism (art)|Historicist or Historismus]] styles of architecture that became popular in both Europe and Britain during the 19th. century. Early examples of the style in Germany of the 1820s and 1830s are referred to as [[Rundbogenstil]] or round arched style.{{sfn|Stratton|1993|pp=54–56}} In Britain the style was introduced by architects and their patrons, who had been on tours in Europe and it appears that the German and British styles of Romanesque developed largely independently. Initially in Britain the style was used for church building, but as the 19th. century progressed it was adapted for public buildings, museums, schools and commercial buildings, but rarely for domestic buildings. By the start of the 20th. century it had gone out of fashion and only occasionally were examples of the style built.

== The origins of the Romanesque Revival or Norman Revival in the United Kingdom ==
[[File:St. Nicholas, Kenilworth, west door.jpg|thumb|left|St. Nicholas, Kenilworth, west door 1570]]
[[File:North Scarle, Lincolnshire.jpg|thumb|150px|North Scarle, Lincolnshire]] 
The development of the ''Norman'' revival style or ''Neo-Norman'' took place over a long time in the British Isles starting with [[Inigo Jones]]‘s [[Window|re-fenestration]] of the White Tower of the [[Tower of London]] in 1637–38 and work at Windsor Castle by [[Hugh May]] for [[Charles II of England|Charles II]], but this was little more than restoration work. More surprising is the west door of Kenilworth Church, inserted in the tower in 1570 probably at the time of a visit of [[Elizabeth I of England|Queen Elizabeth]]. This appears to have been historic arch, sourced possibly from an unknown monastic building,&lt;ref&gt;''Country Life'', 12 January 2016&lt;/ref&gt; Another early example of Romanesque revival is the south porch of North Scarle Church in Lincolnshire. Pevsner suggests that it might be Elizabethan, but late 17th. century seems more likely as the oak door seems to be original and probably of that date.{{sfn|Antram|Pevsner|Harris|1989|p=587}}

[[File:St Martin's Church, Allerton Mauleverer. - geograph.org.uk - 419918.jpg|thumb|St Martin's Church, Allerton Mauleverer. - by John Vardy, 1745]]

In the 18th century the use of round arched windows was thought of as being [[Saxon]] rather than Norman and examples of buildings with round arched windows include [[Shirburn Castle]] in Oxfordshire, Wentworth in Yorkshire and [[Enmore Castle]] in Somerset. At [[Allerton Mauleverer]] in Yorkshire St Martin’s Church was re-built for Richard Arundell in 1745. The church has been described as a ''proto-Neo-Norman''. While it gives the impression of a Romanesque revival church, with a massive crossing tower and round headed windows, yet it also has windows with gothic tracery and a [[hammerbeam roof|hammerbeam]] nave roof. The architect is thought to have been [[John Vardy]] surveyor to the Office of Works.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Leach|Pevsner|2009|p=}}{{page needed|date=May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Tickencote Church - geograph.org.uk - 63353.jpg|thumb|225px|Tickencote Church 1792 Early example of church Romanesque revival]]
A further example of church building in the Romanesque revival style took place in 1792 when Elisa Wingfield commissioned plans from [[Samuel Pepys Cockerell]] for the conservation and rebuilding of [[St Peter's Church, Tickencote]] in Rutland. The church which contained much notable Romanesque decoration and an elaborate [[chancel]] arch appears to have been close to collapse. Cockerell encased the chancel, keeping the arch in position but the outer walls were completely re-built and the exterior ornamentation of arcades and round headed windows were replaced in new stonework. A new tower over a porch was built on the south side, which gave added stability to the older structure. The [[nave]] was completely re-built using some new romanesque mot is and copying others, such as the engaged columns, from those on the exterior of the chancel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |editor-last=Page |editor-first=William |editor-link=William Page (historian)

Tickencote could be considered to mark the start of the Romanesque revival in church architecture. [[File:Front entrance to Eastnor Castle - geograph.org.uk - 1468597.jpg|thumb|left|Front entrance to Eastnor Castle, Herefordshire, combining Romanesque and Gothic features]] In Scotland the style started to emerge with the Duke of Argyll’s castle at [[Inverary]], started in 1744, and castles by [[Robert Adam]] at [[Culzean]] (1771), Oxenfoord (1780–2), Dalquharran (1782–5), and [[Seton Palace]] (1792). In England [[James Wyatt]] used round arched windows at [[Sandleford Priory]], Berkshire in 1780–79 and the Duke of Norfolk started to rebuild [[Arundel Castle]], while [[Eastnor Castle]] in Herefordshire was built by [[Robert Smirke (architect)|Robert Smirke]] between 1812 and 1820. At Eastnor Smirke combines a rugged Romanesque with more subtle Gothic window tracery.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Mowl |first=Timothy |authorlink=Timothy Mowl |year=1981 |title=The Norman Revival in British Architecture 1790–1870}} PhD Thesis, [[University of Oxford]]&lt;/ref&gt;

==The Development of ''Archaeologically Correct'' Romanesque.&lt;ref&gt;The idea of the ''archaeological correctness'' was popularised by [[Nikolaus Pevsner]] in his many writings and he was using the term by 1950 in his Broadcast Talks (page 190) to describe architecture and designs based closely on illustrations of actual buildings or objects.[https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=q8eaBAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA190&amp;lpg=PA190&amp;dq=Pevsner+archaeologically+correct&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=xkM10Y0f1I&amp;sig=gKtc0zp0nG3E71Al_PHmcJZFk5o&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiuiKPAvJfKAhXIYQ4KHR3hCJwQ6AEIHzAA#v=onepage&amp;q=Pevsner%20archaeologically%20correct&amp;f=false]&lt;/ref&gt;==

[[File:Penrhyn Castle - geograph.org.uk - 206536.jpg|thumb|Penrhyn Castle - by Thomas Hopper 1820–37]]
It was at this point that the Norman Revival became a recognisable architectural style. In 1817 [[Thomas Rickman]] published his ''An Attempt to Discriminate the Styles of English Architecture from the Conquest to the Reformation''. It was now realised that ''round-arch architecture'' was largely Romanesque in the British Isles and came to be described as Norman rather than Saxon. This distinction was finally recognised when Rickman’s article in ''Archaeologia'' (1832–33), was published by the [[Society of Antiquaries of London|Society of Antiquaries]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Rickman |first=Thomas |title=` |journal=Archaeologia |volume=XXV |publisher=[[Society of Antiquaries of London]] |pages=159–185}} esp. 166&lt;/ref&gt; The start of an ''archaeologically correct'' Norman Revival can be recognised in the architecture of [[Thomas Hopper (architect)|Thomas Hopper]]. His first attempt at this style was at [[Gosford Castle]] in Armagh in Ireland, but far more successful was his [[Penrhyn Castle]] near Bangor in North Wales. This was built for the Pennant family, between 1820 and 1837. The style did not catch on for domestic buildings, though many country houses and mock castles were built in the Castle Gothic or Castellated style during the Victorian period, which were mixed Gothic styles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Mowl |first=Timothy |authorlink=Timothy Mowl |year=1991 |chapter=Penrhryn and the Norman Revival |series=National Trust Guide |title=Penrhryn Castle, Gwynedd |place= |publisher=National Trust |pages=89–90}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Church Architecture and the Romanesque Revival==

[[File:Christ Church, Welshpool. Chancel arcade in apse behind altar.JPG|thumb|Christ Church, Welshpool. Chancel arcade in apse behind altar]]
However, the ''Norman Revival'' did catch on for church architecture. It was [[Thomas Penson]], a Welsh architect, who would have been familiar with Hopper’s work at Penrhyn, who developed Romanesque Revival church architecture. Penson was influenced by French and Belgian Romanesque architecture, and particularly the earlier Romanesque phase of German [[Brick Gothic]]. At St David’s Newtown, 1843–47 and St Agatha’s Llanymynech, 1845, he copies the tower of [[St. Salvator's Cathedral]], Bruges. Other examples of Romanesque revival by Penson are [[Christ Church, Welshpool]], 1839–1844, and the porch to Langedwyn Church. He was an innovator in the use of [[Architectural terracotta|terracotta]] to produce decorative Romanesque mouldings, saving on the expense of stonework.{{sfn|Stratton|1993|p=13}} Penson’s last church in the Romanesque Revival style was [[Rhosllannerchrugog]], Wrexham of 1852&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Hubbard |first=E |series=The Buildings of Wales |title=Clwyd |place=London |publisher=Penguin |year=1986 |page=264 |isbn=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sarah Losh and Wreay Church===
A most remarkable example of Romanesque church building was [[St Mary's Church, Wreay|St Mary’s Church at Wreay]], near Carlisle.&lt;ref name=Banerjee&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.victorianweb.org/art/architecture/losh/1.html |last=Banerjee |first=Jacqueline |title=St Mary's Church, Wreay, by Sarah Losh (1785–1853) |publisher=Victorian Web |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was designed by [[Sarah Losh]] and built between 1841 and 1842. Losh had travelled widely on the Continent and particularly in Italy and drew inspiration from Romanesque sources. Losh is known to have read [[Thomas Hope (architect)|Thomas Hope]]'s ''Historical Study of Architecture'' (1815), which uses the term ''Lombardic'' for the style brought into Italy from the early Christian churches of Constantinople, and she described St Mary's as being an ''unpolished mode of building'' that ''most approximates to early Saxon or modified Lombard''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Uglow |first=Jenny |authorlink=Jenny Uglow |year=2012 |title=The Pinecone: the Story of Sara Losh |place=London |publisher=[[Faber and Faber]] |isbn=978-0571269501 |page=231}}&lt;/ref&gt; This statement suggests that at the time of its design Losh was not aware of Thomas Rickman’s re-classification of Saxon and Norman architecture. While the appearance and layout of the church may be considered as Romanesque, her free interpretation of the decoration on the woodwork and the arched stone windows and doors is anticipating the styles of the [[Arts and Crafts]] movement, while the arcading of the [[apse]] certainly has a [[Byzantine architecture|Byzantine]] feel to it.&lt;ref name=Banerjee/&gt;

==Other Early Victorian Architects working in the Romanesque revival style==
The early years of the 1840s saw a considerable upsurge of interest in the developing Romanesque revival style by some of the leading architects of the period. During the 19th century the architecture selected for Anglican churches depended on the churchmanship of particular congregations. Whereas [[high church]]es and [[Anglo-Catholic]], which were influenced by the [[Oxford Movement]], were built in [[Gothic Revival architecture]]; low churches and [[Broad church]]es of the period were often built in the Romanesque Revival style.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book
|last=Clark|first=Kenneth|authorlink=Kenneth Clark|pages=170–73|title=The Gothic Revival|edition=3rd|year=1962
|publisher=John Murray|location=London|isbn= 0719502330}}, and also Cambridge Camden Society (1841),''A Few Words to Church-builders''[https://archive.org/details/fewwordstochurch00camb].&lt;/ref&gt; The architects specialising in Romanesque revival took their designs from different local styles of the European Romanesque.

===Edmund Sharpe===
Another architect who popularised the Romanesque revival style was [[Edmund Sharpe]], who set up his practice at [[Lancaster, Lancashire|Lancaster]] in 1835. At Cambridge he had been a great friend of [[William Whewell]] and presumably of the polymath and architectural historian Professor [[Robert Willis (engineer)|Robert Willis]]. He was awarded a travelling scholarship to study the early architecture of Germany and Southern France and supplied [[Thomas Rickman]] with information.&lt;ref name=dnb&gt;O'Donoghue, F. M. (1897), rev. Geoffrey K. Brandwood (2004) [http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/25228 Sharpe, Edmund (1809–1877)], ''[[Oxford Dictionary of National Biography]]'', [[Oxford University Press]], Retrieved on 18 February 2012 ({{ODNBsub}})&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Brandwood|Austin|Hughes|Price|2012|pp=12–15}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, Sharpe despite being an architectural historian of some note, built churches that were much freer interpretations of the Romanesque and [[Brick Gothic|German Brick Gothic]] and might be considered less ''archaeologically correct''.

[[File:St Paul's Parish Church, Scotforth, Doorway - geograph.org.uk - 904970.jpg|thumb|St Paul's, Scotforth, Doorway, 1874–6]]
Four of Sharpe's earliest churches&amp;nbsp;– [[St Saviour's Church, Cuerden|St&amp;nbsp;Saviour, Bamber Bridge]] (1836–37);&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hughes|2010|p=116}}{{clarification needed |reason=What work is this citing? |date=May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[St Mark's Church, Blackburn|St&amp;nbsp;Mark, Witton]] (1836–38); and [[St Paul's Church, Farington|St&amp;nbsp;Paul, Farington]], near [[Leyland, Lancashire|Leyland]] (1839–40)&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hughes|2010|p=125}}{{clarification needed |reason=What work is this citing? |date=May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; – were in the Romanesque style, which he chose because ''no style can be worked so cheap as the Romanesque''. They ''turned out to be little more than rectangular 'preaching boxes'… with no frills and little ornamentation; and many of them were later enlarged''. The only subsequent churches in which Sharpe used Romanesque elements [[St Mary's Church, Conistone]] in [[Wharfedale]] (1846); and [[St Paul's Church, Scotforth|St&amp;nbsp;Paul, Scotforth]] in south Lancaster (1874–6). Sharpe's final essay in the Romanesque Revival style [[St Paul's Church, Scotforth]], was described by [[Nikolaus Pevsner]] as a ''strange building'' and ''an anachronism, almost beyond belief''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Pevsner |first=Nikolaus |authorlink=Nikolaus Pevsner |year=1969 |title=Lancashire |volume=2 The Rural North |series=[[Pevsner Architectural Guides#Buildings of England|The Buildings of England]] |place=Harmondsworth |publisher=[[Penguin Books]] |pages=29, 224}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sharpe had retired from his architectural practice in 1851 He then pursued a career in railway engineering.&lt;ref&gt;O'Donoghue, F.

===Benjamin Ferrey===
[[File:East Grafton - St Nicholas Church - geograph.org.uk - 1448466.jpg|thumb|left|East Grafton - St Nicholas Church, 1842–44]]
[[File:Morpeth, Northumberland, The Church of St James The Great - geograph.org.uk - 223562.jpg|thumb|Morpeth, Northumberland, The Church of St James The Great, 1844–46]] The work of [[Benjamin Ferrey]] can be considered to be similar to that of Thomas Penson, based on the English and French Romanesque traditions. An early example is his church of St Nicholas at [[East Grafton]] in Wiltshire, built in 1842–44.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|website=Wiltshire Community History|title=Church of St. Nicholas, East Grafton|url=http://history.wiltshire.gov.uk/community/getchurch.php?id=1184|publisher=Wiltshire Council|accessdate=27 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Here the chancel terminates in an apse and the west has overlapping arcading and [[Chevron (insignia)|chevron]] decoration over the entrance door. Central crossing tower and arcaded windows on the west frontis approached through a stone Romanesque [[Lych gate]].

A more important work by Ferrey is the Church of St James the Great at [[Morpeth, Northumberland|Morpeth]], Northumberland. The church, which is supposed to be modelled on the cathedral of [[Monreale]] in Sicily,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Tweddle |first=Marilyn |title=A Historical Guide to the Church of St James the Great |place=Morpeth}}&lt;/ref&gt; was built between 1844 and 1846. The unusual arched gate is acceptably Sicilian in inspiration and is similar to the [[portico]] at the cathedral at [[Monreale]], but the rest of the composition has much more in common with French and Belgian Romanesque. A further church in this style is Christ Church in [[Melplash]] in Dorset of 1845–46. This has a heavy crossing tower and in many respects resembles the Church of St. James the Great at Morpeth.

===William Perkin of Leeds===
St Michael and All Angels [[Barton le Street]], North Yorkshire.
This church was very extensively rebuilt in 1869–71 by William Perkin and his sons of Leeds. Unlike Tickencote there is no record of the church that was replaced. The building contains an extensive and impressive range of genuine romanesque, but these seem to have been largely repositioned. The pews and some other furnishings are in Romanesque revival style. The rebuilding was financed by [[Hugo Francis Meynell Ingram|Hugo Francis Meynell-Ingram]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Pevsner |first=Nikolaus |authorlink=Nikolaus Pevsner |year=1966 |title=Yorkshire: the North Riding |series=[[Pevsner Architectural Guides#Buildings of England|The Buildings of England]] |place=Harmondsworth |publisher=[[Penguin Books]] |isbn=0-14-071029-9 |page=73}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{NHLE| num=1148993 |desc=Church of St Michael |grade=I |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Baptist Church, Brown Street, Salisbury - geograph.org.uk - 195730.jpg|thumb|left|Baptist Church, Brown Street, Salisbury]]

In the 1860s Romanesque architecture became a popular style of architecture for [[Dissenting]] chapels. Possibly this was intended to give the impression that they were churches similar to [[Anglican]] churches and they are often referred to as churches rather than chapels. This form of architecture was often chosen by the [[Baptists]]. This architecture is an adapted and debased form of [[Italianate]] Romanesque as seen at the [[Potters Bar|Potter's Bar]] Old Baptist Church in Hertfordshire in 1859.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pbbc.org.uk/home Potters Bar Baptist Church]&lt;/ref&gt; The Baptist Church in Brown Street [[Salisbury]] of the 1880s is similar in bright red brick and was built in the 1880s. It is noticeably more ''archaeologically correct'' in its use of arched windows and the entrance door. A Baptist Chapel of 1870 by the Lincoln architects [[Michael Drury|Drury and Mortimer]], the Mint Lane Baptist Chapel in Lincoln is in a debased Italianate Romanesque revival style but has a surprising tower in the [[castellated]] Gothic style.{{sfn|Antram|Pevsner|Harris|1989|p=521–2}}

[[File:Grimsby Synagogue - geograph.org.uk - 141647.jpg|thumb|Grimsby Synagogue]]

===Synagogues===
The Romanesque revival was also a style of architecture that appealed to Jewish communities and there are examples of Synagogues in this style. 
One of these is the synagogue built adjacent to the docks at [[Grimsby]] in Lincolnshire.

===Later Romanesque Revival Churches in Scotland===

[[File:West Kirk (geograph 1866764).jpg|thumb|West Kirk, Sandgate, Ayr, by William Gale 1844–45]] 
The earliest example of Romanesque revival architecture in Scotland is the West Kirk, Sandgate, Ayr. By the architect William Gale for the Presbyterian [[Free Church of Scotland (1843–1900)|Free Church]] and built in 1844–45. The columns used for the windows are very similar to those used by Edmund Sharpe at Scotford church.
In Scotland the [[Church of Scotland|Presbyterian]]s occasionally built in the Romanesque revival style, but only later in the 19th century. 
[[St Conan’s Kirk]] Lochawe, Agyll and Bute is an extraordinary early 20th century church on the shore of Loch Awe, built by Walter Douglas Campbell, brother of the 1st Lord Blythswood, was started in 1881, but not completed until 1930. The kirk is largely Romanesque in style, but is also mixed with other completely unrelated styles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.britainexpress.com/attractions.htm?attraction=1082 |title=St Conan's Kirk |publisher=Britain Express |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another church is Cranshaws in [[Berwickshire]].

==Sir Alfred Waterhouse and developed Romanesque Architecture==
[[File:Natural History Museum 001.jpg|thumb|left|Natural History Museum 001]]
[[File:Ukrainian Catholic Cathedral of the Holy Family in Exile, London, UK - Diliff.jpg|thumb|Ukrainian Catholic Cathedral of the Holy Family in Exile, London]]
Interest in Romanesque Revival Architecture was renewed by Sir [[Alfred Waterhouse]]'s [[Natural History Museum]] in Kensington, which was built between 1873 and 1881.{{sfn|Stratton|1993|pp=70–77}} It was built in shades of buff coloured [[Architectural terracotta|terracotta]] and opened the way for the Romanesque style to be used for other buildings, apart from churches. Waterhouse tended to mix the architectural styles, often using decorative Romanesque arches to provide impressive entrances for his buildings, and popularised the deep red terracotta produced by manufacturer's in the [[Wrexham]] and [[Ruabon]] area of North-East Wales. This included parts of the Prudential Insurance building in London and the entrance to Strangeways Prison.

Waterhouse inspired other architects to build using terracotta and this material was used by [[William Watkins (architect)|William Watkins]], a Lincoln architect who very successfully used a deep red [[Ruabon]] terracotta for the Lincoln Christ's Hospital Girls School of 1893.{{sfn|Antram|Pevsner|Harris|1989|p=509}} An earlier building by Watkins of 1873, was originally built as a warehouse at 42 Silver Street, Lincoln.

[[File:St Aidans 2754.jpg|thumb|left|St Aidan's Church, Leeds]]
[[St Aidan's Church, Leeds]] is a massive [[basilica]] church built in the tradition of Waterhouse, using red terracotta brickwork. The design was won by competition in 1889 and the church was built between 1891 and 1894 by the Newcastle architects RJ Johnson and A Crawford Hick. The style is a hybrid of Italian, French and German Romaneque and the [[Corbel table]] or moulded [[stringcourse]] below the eaves was based on that of [[Lund Cathedral]] in Sweden. The inside is sumptuously decorated with mosaic decoration by Sir [[Frank Brangwyn]] in the apse and a multi-coloured marble font with Romanesque arcading. The interior columns of the basilica have ornamental [[capital (architecture)|capital]]s in the Byzantine style.{{sfn|Leach|Pevsner|2009|pp=525–7}}

In the 20th.century the use of the Romanesque revival style in church architecture appears to be restricted to brick built churches and often these churches have similarities with churches built in the [[Byzantine Revival architecture|Byzantine revival style]], which became more popular in the early years of the 20th century. 
Churches in the Romanesque revival style include All Saints, Bute Avenue, [[Petersham, London|Petersham]], Richmond-upon-Thames. This Romanesque revival church was designed by J Kelly and completed in 1908.

An even later example of the style is St Francis, Linden Road, Bournville, consecrated in 1925. This church was designed by Harvey and Wicks, the architects of the Bournville Estate

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4992">The '''Sábato triangle''' ({{lang-es|Triángulo de Sabato}}) is a model concerned with linkages between science, industry and government, which has informed discussions of science policy throughout Latin America. It was developed during the 1960s and 1970s by the Argentine physicist and metallurgist [[Jorge Sábato|Jorge Alberto Sábato]], of the [[National Atomic Energy Commission]] (CNEA, the Argentine government agency overseeing development of nuclear power in the country).

==Brief description==
The idea of the triangle was proposed by [[John Kenneth Galbraith]] and developed by Sábato as a model of [[policy]]-making in science and technology.&lt;ref name="Adler1987"&gt;{{cite book|author=Emanuel Adler|title=The Power of Ideology: The Quest for Technological Autonomy in Argentina and Brazil|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=YSih4JkUBesC&amp;pg=PA302|year=1987|publisher=University of California Press|isbn=978-0-520-05485-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|302-303}}  The model is based on the concept that in order for a scientific-technological system to exist in practice it is necessary for three sectors to be strongly linked together over the long term: the [[State (polity)|State]] (which formulates and implements policy); the scientific and technological infrastructure (which provides technology); and the productive sector (which uses technology). These ''interrelationships'' are portrayed in the form of a [[triangle]].&lt;ref name="Adler1987" /&gt;{{rp|58-59}}&lt;ref name="GöranssonBrundenius2016"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Bo Göransson|author2=Claes Brundenius|author3=Carlos Aguirre-Bastos|title=Innovation Systems for Development: Making Research and Innovation in Developing Countries Matter|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=54AwDQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA47|year=2016|publisher=Edward Elgar Publishing|isbn=978-1-78347-383-0|page=47}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Further, each "[[Vertex (geometry)|vertex]]" needs to have strong ''internal relations'', that is to say, relations between the different institutions contained within itself.  For example, within the State there needs to be coherence between "implicit" policy and "explicit" policy, between different [[Ministry (government department)|ministries]] and autonomous organizations, and so on. The other factor considered is the ''external relations'' between the "vertices" and outside entities.

The triangle has been used to shed light on technological [[Dependency theory|dependency]]. The model predicts that the stronger the external relations, the weaker or non-existent will be the interrelationships and the internal relations, and this will delay the country in reducing its dependency.&lt;ref name="Bastos2003"&gt;{{cite book|author=Maria Ines Bastos|title=The Politics of Technology in Latin America|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=XgWFAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA16|date=2 September 2003|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-1-134-79937-4|page=16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Impact==
The Sábato Triangle won acceptance in several countries of Latin America, having an effect upon science and technology policy there and disseminating the belief that the State had an important role in promoting [[technology transfer]].&lt;ref name="Adler1987" /&gt;{{rp|58}}{{rp|302-303}} However, a separation of the three components of the "triangle" has still been observed in more recent times.&lt;ref name="GibsonHeitor2005"&gt;Isabel Bortagaray and Scott Tiffin, "Innovation clusters in Latin America", in {{cite book|author1=David V. Gibson|author2=Manuel V. Heitor|author3=Alejandro Ibarra Yunez (eds.)|title=Learning and Knowledge for the Network Society|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=sPlZgenaAZEC&amp;pg=PA273|year=2005|publisher=Purdue University Press|isbn=978-1-55753-356-2|page=273}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Sir [[Peter Blake (sailor)|Peter Blake]] Marine Education &amp; Recreation Centre''' (MERC) is a not for profit charity (Registration Number CC29903) based in [[Long Bay, New Zealand|Long Bay]], [[Auckland]], [[New Zealand]]. MERC offers marine-based [[environmental education]] and outdoor recreational experiences to schools, not-for-profit organisations, and business and corporate groups. 

MERC can accommodate up to 85 people at any time for overnight stays and activities, and up to a total of 120 people per day. A day programme consists of 3 activities on the day and instruction is given between 9am and 4pm. There is scope to organise short duration, single day and multi-day courses, and these are specifically developed to meet the needs of each group. MERCs facilities have separate teacher/leader accommodation, multi-purpose hall, wheelchair access and large kitchen &amp; dining facilities.

The Centre's mission statement is ''to provide life-changing marine environmental education and outdoor experiences for young New Zealanders.''

==History==
The Centre has been in operation since 1990. A group of local yachtsmen and teachers (Don St.Clair Brown, Don Burfoot, Laurie Baxter, Ian Sage, Dr. Ross Garrett and John Orams, responded to the vision of fellow yachtsman Dr. David Gray, that a centre be built on the present site which was designated “Conditional Use Reserve” land belonging to Takapuna City Council. In 1980 this site was littered with building debris, scraps of machinery and foundations of early buildings. These basic amenities had serviced the large Long Bay camping population as well as local holiday residents in their numerous beaches. There was a store with petrol pumps – started by Tom Vaughan about 1920 but taken over by Mr and Mrs Aston and demolished about 1950 (?), a butchery owned by Mr Lopes which later became a private beach, a holiday house built above the sea wall (1956) still tenanted in 1989.

{{Sociology}}
The '''sociology of culture''', and the related cultural sociology, concerns the systematic analysis of [[culture]], usually understood as the ensemble of symbolic codes used by a members of a society, as it is manifested in the society. For [[Georg Simmel]], culture referred to "the cultivation of individuals through the [[Agency (sociology)|agency]] of external forms which have been objectified in the course of history". Culture in the sociological field is analyzed as the ways of thinking and describing, acting, and the material objects that together shape a group of people's way of life.

Contemporary sociologists' approach to culture is often divided between a "sociology of culture" and "cultural sociology"—the terms are similar, though not interchangeable.&lt;ref name="wordpress"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://orgtheory.wordpress.com/2006/08/27/the-sociology-of-culture-versus-cultural-sociology/|title=the sociology of culture versus cultural sociology &amp;#124; orgtheory.net|publisher=orgtheory.wordpress.com|accessdate=2014-10-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''sociology of culture'' is an older concept, and considers some topics and objects as more-or-less "cultural" than others. By way of contrast, [[Jeffrey C. Alexander]] introduced the term ''cultural sociology'', an approach that sees all, or most, [[Social phenomenon|social phenomena]] as inherently cultural at some level.&lt;ref name="umn"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blog.lib.umn.edu/edgell/culture/|title=Sociology of Culture and Cultural Sociology|publisher=blog.lib.umn.edu|accessdate=2014-10-01|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150505182344/http://blog.lib.umn.edu/edgell/culture/|archivedate=2015-05-05|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; For instance, a leading proponent of the "[[Strong programme|strong program]]" in cultural sociology, Alexander argues: "To believe in the possibility of cultural sociology is to subscribe to the idea that every action, no matter how instrumental, reflexive, or coerced [compared to] its external environment, is embedded to some extent in a horizon of [[Affect (psychology)|affect]] and [[Meaning (philosophy of language)|meaning]]."&lt;ref&gt;The Meanings of Social Life: A Cultural Sociology By Jeffrey C. Alexander https://books.google.com/books?id=CIA3AwAAQBAJ&amp;lpg=PT10&amp;ots=csNoAH4xzN&amp;dq=%22cultural%20turn%22&amp;lr&amp;pg=PT18#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false&lt;/ref&gt; In terms of analysis, sociology of culture often attempts to explain some discretely cultural phenomena as a product of social processes, while cultural sociology sees culture as a component of explanations of social phenomena.&lt;ref name="google"&gt;{{cite book|title=Cultures and Societies in a Changing World|author1=Griswold, W.|author2=Carroll, C.|date=2012|publisher=SAGE Publications|isbn=9781412990547|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=dwQPS4H3aVcC}}&lt;/ref&gt; As opposed to the field of [[cultural studies]], cultural sociology does not reduce all human matters to a problem of cultural encoding and decoding. For instance, [[Pierre Bourdieu]]'s cultural sociology has a "clear recognition of the social and the economic as categories which are interlinked with, but not reducible to, the cultural."&lt;ref&gt;Rojek, Chris, and Bryan Turner. "Decorative sociology: towards a critique of the cultural turn." The Sociological Review 48.4 (2000): 629-648.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Development==

Cultural sociology first emerged in [[Weimar, Germany]], where sociologists such as [[Alfred Weber]] used the term ''Kultursoziologie'' (cultural sociology). Cultural sociology was then "reinvented" in the English-speaking world as a product of the "[[cultural turn]]" of the 1960s, which ushered in [[structuralism (sociology)|structuralist]] and [[postmodern philosophy|postmodern]] approaches to social science. This type of cultural sociology may loosely be regarded as an approach incorporating [[cultural analysis]] and [[critical theory]]. In the beginning of the cultural turn, sociologists tended to use qualitative methods and hermeneutic approaches to research, focusing on meanings, words, artifacts and symbols. "Culture" has since become an important concept across many branches of sociology, including historically quantitative and model-based subfields, such as [[social stratification]] and [[social network|social network analysis]].

===Early researchers===
The sociology of culture grew from the intersection between sociology, as shaped by early theorists like [[Karl Marx|Marx]], [[Émile Durkheim|Durkheim]], and [[Max Weber|Weber]], and [[anthropology]] where researchers pioneered [[Ethnography|ethnographic]] strategies for describing and analyzing a variety of cultures around the world. 
Part of the legacy of the early development of the field is still felt in the methods (much of cultural sociological research is qualitative) in the theories (a variety of critical approaches to sociology are central to current research communities) and substantive focus of the field. For instance, relationships between [[popular culture]], political control, and [[social class]] were early and lasting concerns in the field.

====Karl Marx====
{{Main|Karl Marx}}
As a major contributor to [[conflict theory]], Marx argued that culture served to justify inequality. The ruling class, or the [[bourgeoisie]], produce a culture that promotes their interests, while repressing the interests of the [[proletariat]]. 
His most famous line to this effect is that "Religion is the [[opium of the people]]".
Marx believed that the "engine of history" was the struggle between groups of people with diverging economic interests and thus the economy determined the cultural [[Base and superstructure|superstructure]] of [[values]] and [[ideologies]]. For this reason, Marx is a considered a ''[[materialist]]'' as he believes that the economic (material) produces the cultural (ideal), which "stands [[Hegel]] on his head,"&lt;ref&gt;http://www.nyu.edu/classes/jackson/calhoun.jackson.theory/papers/A--MarxGeneral.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; who argued the ideal produced the material.

====Émile Durkheim====
{{Main|Émile Durkheim}}
Durkheim held the belief that culture has many relationships to society which include:
* ''Logical'' – Power over individuals belongs to certain cultural categories, and beliefs such as in God.
* ''Functional –'' Certain rites and myths create and build up social order by having more people create strong beliefs. The greater the number of people who believe strongly in these myths more will the social order be strengthened.
* ''Historical –'' Culture had its origins in society, and from those experiences came evolution into things such as classification systems.

====Max Weber====
{{Main|Max Weber}}
Weber innovated the idea of a [[status group]] as a certain type of subculture. Status groups are based on things such as: race, ethnicity, religion, region, occupation, gender, sexual preference, etc. These groups live a certain lifestyle based on different values and norms. They are a culture within a culture, hence the label subculture. Weber also purported the idea that people were motivated by their material and ideal interests, which include things such as preventing one from going to hell. Weber also explains that people use symbols to express their spirituality, that symbols are used to express the spiritual side of real events, and that ideal interests are derived from symbols.

====Georg Simmel====
{{Main|Georg Simmel}}
For Simmel, culture refers to "the cultivation of individuals through the agency of external forms which have been objectified in the course of history."&lt;ref&gt;Levine, Donald (ed) 'Simmel: On individuality and social forms' Chicago University Press, 1971. pxix.&lt;/ref&gt; Simmel presented his analyses within a context of "form" and "content". Sociological concept and analysis can be viewed.

== The elements of a culture== 
As no two cultures are exactly alike they do all have common characteristics.
&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ocs.cnyric.org/webpages/phyland/global_10.cfm?subpage=19595&lt;/ref&gt;

A culture contains:

'''1. Social Organization:''' Structured by organizing its members into smaller numbers to meet the cultures specific requirements. Social classes ranked in order of importance (status) based on the cultures core values. In example: money, job, education, family, etc. 

'''2. Customs and Traditions:''' Rules of behavior enforced by the cultures ideas of right and wrong such as is customs, traditions, rules, or written laws.

'''3. Symbols:''' Any thing that carries particular meaning recognized by people who share the same culture.&lt;ref name=gerber&gt;{{cite book|authors=Gerber, John J., and Linda M. Macionis |title=Sociology|publisher=Pearson Canada|location=Toronto|isbn=978-0-13-700161-3|pages=59–65|edition=7th Canadian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''4. [[Social norm|Norms]]:''' Rules and expectations by which a society guides the behavior of its members. The two types of norms are mores and folkways. '''[[Mores]]''' are norms that are widely observed and have a great moral significance. '''Folkways''' are norms for routine, casual interaction.&lt;ref name=gerber /&gt;

'''5. Religion:''' The answers to their basic meanings of life and values.

'''6. Language:''' A system of symbols that allows people to communicate with one another.&lt;ref name=gerber /&gt;

'''7. Arts and Literature:''' Products of human imagination made into art, music, literature, stories, and dance.

'''8. Forms of Government:''' How the culture distributes power. Who keeps the order within the society, who protects them from danger, and who provides for their needs. Can fall into terms such as [[Democracy]], [[Republic]], or [[Dictatorship]].

'''9. Economic Systems:''' What to produce, how to produce it, and for whom. How people use their limited resources to satisfy their wants and needs. Can fall into the terms Traditional Economy, [[Market Economy]], [[Command Economy]], [[Mixed Economy]].

'''10. Artifacts:''' Distinct material objects, such as architecture, technologies, and artistic creations.

'''11.  Social institutions:''' Patterns of organization and relationships regarding governance, production, socializing, education, knowledge creation, arts, and relating to other cultures.

 
==Anthropology==
In an anthropological sense, culture is society based on the values and ideas without influence of the material world.&lt;ref&gt;Radcliffe-Brown&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Quote|text=The cultural system is the cognitive and symbolic matrix for the central values system|sign=[[Talcott Parsons]]|source=}}

Culture is like the shell of a lobster. Human nature is the organism living inside of that shell. The shell, culture, identifies the organism, or human nature. Culture is what sets human nature apart, and helps direct the life of human nature.

[[Anthropology|Anthropologists]] lay claim to the establishment of modern uses of the culture concept as defined by [[Edward Burnett Tylor]] in the mid-19th century.

===Bronisław Malinowski===
{{Main|Bronisław Malinowski}}
Malinowski collected data from the [[Trobriand Islands]]. Descent groups across the island claim parts of the land, and to back up those claims, they tell myths of how an ancestress started a clan and how the clan descends from that ancestress. Malinowski's observations followed the research of that found by Durkheim.

===Alfred Reginald Radcliffe-Brown===
{{Main|Alfred Reginald Radcliffe-Brown}}
Radcliffe-Brown put himself in the culture of the [[Andaman Islands|Andaman Islanders]]. His research showed that group solidification among the islanders is based on music and kinship, and the rituals that involve the use of those activities. In the words of Radcliffe-Brown, "Ritual fortifies Society".

===Marcel Mauss===
{{Main|Marcel Mauss}}
Marcel Mauss made many comparative studies on religion, magic, law and morality of occidental and non-occidental societies, and developed the concept of [[total social fact]], and argued that the reciprocity is the universal logic of the cultural interaction.

===Claude Lévi-Strauss===
{{Main|Claude Lévi-Strauss}}
Lévi-Strauss, based, at the same time, on the sociological and anthropological [[positivism]] of Durkheim, Mauss, Malinowski and Radcliffe-Brown, on the economic and sociological [[marxism]], on [[freudian]] and [[Gestalt psychology]] and on [[structural linguistics]] of Saussure and Jakobson, realized great studies on areas myth, kinship, religion, ritual, symbolism, magic, [[ideology]] (souvage pensée), knowledge, art and aesthetics, applying the [[methodological structuralism]] on his investigations. He searched the universal principals of human thought as a form of explaining social behaviors and structures.

==Major areas of research==

===Theoretical constructs in Bourdieu's sociology of culture===
French sociologist [[Pierre Bourdieu]]'s influential model of society and social relations has its roots in [[Marxist theorists|Marxist theories]] of [[Marxian class theory|class]] and [[Social conflict theory|conflict]]. Bourdieu characterizes social relations in the context of what he calls the ''[[Field (Bourdieu)|field]]'', defined as a competitive system of social relations functioning according to its own specific logic or rules. The ''field'' is the site of struggle for power between the dominant and subordinate classes. It is within the ''field'' that [[Legitimacy (criminal law)|legitimacy]]—a key aspect defining the dominant class—is conferred or withdrawn.

Bourdieu's theory of practice is practical rather than [[Discursive psychology|discursive]], embodied as well as cognitive and durable though adaptive. A valid concern that sets the agenda in Bourdieu's [[Practice theory|theory of practice]] is how action follows regular statistical patterns without the product of accordance to rules, norms and/or conscious intention. To explain this concern, Bourdieu explains [[Habitus (sociology)|habitus]] and [[field (Bourdieu)|field]]. Habitus explains the mutually penetrating realities of individual subjectivity and societal objectivity after the function of social construction. It is employed to transcend the [[Subjectivity|subjective]] and [[Objectivity (philosophy)|objective]] dichotomy.

===Cultural change===
{{Further|Trans-cultural diffusion}}
The belief that culture is symbolically coded and can thus be taught from one person to another means that cultures, although bounded, can change. Cultures are both predisposed to change and resistant to it. [[Resistance (psychoanalysis)|Resistance]] can come from habit, religion, and the integration and interdependence of cultural traits.

[[Culture change|Cultural change]] can have many causes, including: the environment, inventions, and contact with other cultures.

Several understandings of how cultures change come from anthropology. For instance, in diffusion theory, the form of something moves from one culture to another, but not its meaning. For example, the [[Ankh|ankh symbol]] originated in [[Culture of Egypt|Egyptian culture]] but has diffused to numerous cultures. Its original meaning may have been lost, but it is now used by many practitioners of [[New Age religion]] as an arcane symbol of power or life forces. A variant of the diffusion theory, [[stimulus diffusion]], refers to an element of one culture leading to an invention in another.

Contact between cultures can also result in [[acculturation]]. Acculturation has different meanings, but in this context refers to replacement of the traits of one culture with those of another, such as what happened with many [[Native American Indians]]. Related processes on an individual level are [[Assimilation (sociology)|assimilation]] and [[transculturation]], both of which refer to adoption of a different culture by an individual.

Griswold outlined another sociological approach to cultural change. Griswold points out that it may seem as though culture comes from individuals – which, for certain elements of cultural change, is true – but there is also the larger, collective, and long-lasting culture that cannot have been the creation of single individuals as it predates and post-dates individual humans and contributors to culture. The author presents a [[sociological perspective]] to address this conflict.

Sociology suggests an alternative to both the view that it has always been an unsatisfying way  at one extreme and the sociological individual genius view at the other. This alternative posits that culture and cultural works are collective, not individual, creations. We can best understand specific cultural objects... by seeing them not as unique to their creators but as the fruits of collective production, fundamentally social in their genesis. (p.&amp;nbsp;53)
In short, Griswold argues that culture changes through the contextually dependent and socially situated actions of individuals; macro-level culture influences the individual who, in turn, can influence that same culture. The logic is a bit circular, but illustrates how culture can change over time yet remain somewhat constant.

It is, of course, important to recognize here that Griswold is talking about cultural change and not the actual origins of culture (as in, "there was no culture and then, suddenly, there was"). Because Griswold does not explicitly distinguish between the origins of cultural change and the origins of culture, it may appear as though Griswold is arguing here for the origins of culture and situating these origins in society. This is neither accurate nor a clear representation of sociological thought on this issue. Culture, just like society, has existed since the beginning of humanity (humans being social and cultural). Society and culture co-exist because humans have social relations and meanings tied to those relations (e.g. brother, lover, friend). Culture as a super-phenomenon has no real beginning except in the sense that humans (homo sapiens) have a beginning. This, then, makes the question of the origins of culture moot – it has existed as long as we have, and will likely exist as long as we do. Cultural change, on the other hand, is a matter that can be questioned and researched, as Griswold does.

===Culture theory===
[[Culture theory]], developed in the 1980s and 1990s, sees audiences as playing an active rather than passive role in relation to mass media. One strand of research focuses on the audiences and how they interact with media; the other strand of research focuses on those who produce the media, particularly the news.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.cliffsnotes.com:80/study_guide/topicArticleId-26957,articleId-26946.html|title=The Role and Influence of Mass Media|last=|first=|date=|website=Cliffs Notes|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120821005211/http://www.cliffsnotes.com:80/study_guide/topicArticleId-26957,articleId-26946.html|archive-date=22 September 2018|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Computer-mediated communication as culture===
{{Main|Computer-mediated communication}}

Computer-mediated communication (CMC) is the process of sending messages—primarily, but not limited to text messages—through the direct use by participants of computers and communication networks. By restricting the definition to the direct use of computers in the communication process, you have to get rid of the communication technologies that rely upon computers for switching technology (such as telephony or compressed video), but do not require the users to interact directly with the computer system via a keyboard or similar computer interface. To be mediated by computers in the sense of this project, the communication must be done by participants fully aware of their interaction with the computer technology in the process of creating and delivering messages. Given the current state of computer communications and networks, this limits CMC to primarily text-based messaging, while leaving the possibility of incorporating sound, graphics, and video images as the technology becomes more sophisticated.

===Cultural institutions===
{{Main|Cultural Institutions Studies}}
Cultural activities are institutionalised; the focus on institutional settings leads to the investigation "of activities in the cultural sector, conceived as historically evolved societal forms of organising the conception, production, distribution, propagation, interpretation, reception, conservation and maintenance of specific cultural goods".&lt;ref&gt;Zembylas, Tasos (2004): Kulturbetriebslehre. Begründung einer Inter-Disziplin. Wiesbaden: VS-Verlag für Sozialwissenschaften, p. 13.&lt;/ref&gt; Cultural Institutions Studies is therefore a specific approach within the sociology of culture.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8529">The '''Sydney Accord''' is an international mutual recognition agreement for qualifications in the fields of [[engineering technology]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.ieagreements.org/sydney/| title=The Sydney Accord| publisher=International Engineering Alliance}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Definition and background==
The Sydney Accord is an agreement between the bodies responsible for [[accredit]]ing engineering technologist qualification programs in each of the signatory countries. 
It recognizes the substantial [[equivalency]] of programs accredited by those bodies, and recommends that graduates of accredited programs in any of the signatory countries be recognized by the other countries as having met the academic requirements for entry to the practice of engineering technologist. The Sydney Accord was signed in 2001.

==Scope==
The Sydney Accord covers '''engineering technologist''' qualifications.

The scope of the Sydney Accord only covers the ''academic'' requirement for an engineering technologist qualification.  Engineering technologist titles do not transfer directly between signatory countries that don't have reciprocating agreements, because the signatory countries reserve the right to scrutinize foreign titles and compare them to their own licensing criteria. However, this does not mean the titles are not respected by employers within those signatory countries.

The engineering technologist may be hired within a country by an employer where a formal license is not required. The ''industrial exemption'' clause negates formal engineering registration within the United States for those who meet the criteria.

Foreign titles may be utilized as a foundation for recognition of professional licensing.  The titles can be supplemented with additional experience and/or training to meet the local definition of formal registration.  This serves to underline that a foreign technologist covered under the accord does not arrive in a fellow signatory country without merit.  The Sydney Accord is therefore not a hollow agreement without advantages.

==Accord Enhancements==
The [[Canadian Council of Technicians and Technologists]] (CCTT) and the United Kingdom's [[Institution of Incorporated Engineers]] (IIE) signed a reciprocating agreement of recognition for engineering technologist. In 2006, the IIE merged with the [[Institute of Electrical Engineers]] (IEE) to form the [[Institution of Engineering and Technology]] (IET). The CCTT also signed a reciprocating agreement with the [[National Institute for Certification in Engineering Technologies]] (NICET).  NICET is a United States organization sponsored by the [[National Society of Professional Engineers]] (NSPE).  The formal recognition of the CCTT as a common link between NICET and the IET has not been realized.

===Canada===
Canada has signed the Sydney Accord with the title of "Applied Science" and "Engineering Technologist".

The Canadian signatory body is the [[Canadian Council of Technicians and Technologists]] (CCTT).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| publisher=CCTT| title=National and International Mobility| url=http://www.cctt.ca/template.asp?id=66BCF9F972D1468B9286F72D20549DE1}}&lt;/ref&gt;   This is different from the Canadian signatory of the [[Washington Accord]], [[Engineers Canada]].

In the case of all other Sydney Accord members, the same organization has signed both the Sydney Accord and the Washington Accord.

===Hong Kong===
Hong Kong originally signed the Sydney Accord with the title of "Science Technologist" and later abbreviated the title to "Technologist."

===United States===
The [[United States]] applied for recognition with the Sydney Accord in 2007 and was granted that status in 2009. Despite this achievement the United States still has significant confusion in defining a unified technologist registration for professionals. Part of the reason for this is that the engineering technology profession is not well defined as a separate profession (distinct from professional engineering) in the United States. This is because the NSPE has opposed legal registration of technologist by the United States government through a licensing program. The loss of government oversight has led to competing ideologies from societies with different perspectives on what represents the qualities of a technologist.

====Confusion====
Some legitimate societies and organizations that have established technology programs do not have clear representation in the accord. The [[Society of Manufacturing Engineers]] (SME), and the [[Society of Broadcast Engineers]] (SBE) are two organizations that have engineering technology and technician certifications that are respected and recognized but operate independently from the accord.  In addition to these societies there are legitimate accreditations that are unacknowledged.  They are the [[Distance Education and Training Council]] (DETC), the [[National Association of Industrial Technology]] (NAIT), the [[Accrediting Commission of Career Schools and Colleges of Technology]] (ACCSCT), or other non-[[ABET]]/TAC institutions that are exclusively regionally accredited.  It is unclear if these organizations or societies will eventually be represented by a formal avenue of recognition in the Sydney Accord.

==Registrations==
As an international representative of the accord the UK offer a registration program for individuals from any country.  However, since the standards for technologist are higher in UK (B.Sc. and B.Eng. in Engineering) only 25 UK (emigrating) registrants up to this date applied for registration as "Technologist" indicating the failure of the Accord within UK.  In the UK the term "engineer", "professional engineer" or "engineering" have no meaning in law so anyone can call themselves a professional engineer, or technologist without restrictions. However the titles "Chartered Engineer", "Incorporated Engineer" and "Engineering Technician" awarded by The Engineering Council (UK) are protected by law. United States' graduates may apply for a peer review by the [[Engineering Council UK]] if they belong to one of the organizations or societies that are not explicitly mentioned as a member of the accord.  Individuals that graduate from a regionally accredited technology program are likely to receive acceptance through professional engineering registration as an Incorporated Engineer.

U.S. professional registration is a [[U.S. state|state]] concern. While the profession of engineering technologist is not specifically recognised, many states provide engineering technologists with a pathway towards ''Professional Engineer (PE)'' licensing that bypasses national engineering requirements. This is opposed by the national regulatory and representative bodies for professional engineers, the National Society of Professional Engineers (NSPE). Notably, the Washington Accord does not apply to American PEs who have obtained this status through a technologist route.

{{Orphan|date=November 2015}}

'''System-level simulation (SLS)''' is a collection of practical methods used in the field of [[systems engineering]], in order to simulate, with a [[Computer simulation|computer]], the global behavior of large cyber-physical systems.

[[Cyber-physical system]]s (CPS) are systems composed of physical entities regulated by computational elements (e.g. electronic controllers).

System-level simulation is mainly characterized by:
* a level of detail adapted to the practical simulation of large and complex cyber-physical systems (e.g. plants, aircraft, industrial facilities)
* the possibility to use the simulation even if the system is not fully specified, i.e. simulation does not necessarily require a detailed knowledge of each part of the system. This makes it possible to use the simulation for conception or study phases, even at an early stage in this process
These two characteristics have several implications in terms of modeling choices (see [[#Modeling choices|further]]).

System-level simulation has some other characteristics, that it shares with CPS simulation in general:
* SLS involves multi-physics models (thermo-fluidic, mechanical, electrical, etc.)
* SLS is frequently cross-disciplinary,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = NASA - System-Level Simulation|url = http://www.nasa.gov/centers/ames/research/technology-onepagers/sys-sim.html|website = www.nasa.gov|accessdate = 2015-11-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; i.e. it is frequently the result of a collaboration between people with different expertises
* SLS is generally built upon a hierarchy of models; an organized modeling is usually necessary to make the whole model envisagable; the conceptual decomposition of the system into sub-systems is related to the notion of [[System of systems engineering|system of systems]]
SLS is mainly about computing the evolution over time of the physical quantities that characterize the system of interest, but other aspects can be added like [[Reliability engineering|failure modeling]] or [[Verification and validation|requirement verification]].

== Motivations and benefit ==
The main motivation for SLS is the application of the [[Holism|holistic principle]] to computer simulation, which would state that simulating the system as a whole tells more than simulating parts of the system separately.
Indeed, simulating the different parts of a complex system separately means neglecting all the possible effects of their mutual interactions.
In many applications, these interactions cannot be ignored because of strong dependencies between the parts. For instance, many CPSs contain [[feedback]]s that cannot be broken without modifying the system behavior. Feedbacks can be found in most modern industrial systems, which generally include one or more [[Industrial control system|control systems]]. Another example of benefits from system level simulations is reflected in the high degree of accuracy (e.g. less than 1% cumulative validation error over 6 months of operation) of such simulations in the case of a solar thermal system&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Fontanella |first1=Giuliano |last2=Basciotti |first2=Daniele |last3=Dubisch |first3=Florian |last4=Judex |first4=Florian |last5=Preisler |first5=Anita |last6=Hettfleisch |first6=Christian |last7=Vukovic |first7=Vladimir |last8=Selke |first8=Tim |title=Calibration and validation of a solar thermal system model in Modelica |journal=Building Simulation |date=2012 |volume=5 |issue=3 |pages=293-300 |doi=10.1007/s12273-012-0070-y |url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s12273-012-0070-y |ref=2}}&lt;/ref&gt;. 

On the other hand, simply connecting existing simulation tools, each built specifically to simulate one of the system parts, is not possible for large systems since it would lead to unacceptable computation times.
SLS aims at developing new tools and choosing relevant simplifications in order to be able to simulate the whole cyber-physical system.

SLS has many benefits compared to detailed co-simulation of the system sub-parts.
The results of a simulation at the system level are not as accurate as those of simulations at a finer level of detail but, with adapted simplifications, it is possible to simulate at an early stage, even when the system is not fully specified yet. Early bugs or design flaws can then be detected more easily.

SLS is also useful as a common tool for cross-discipline experts, engineers and managers and can consequently enhance the cooperative efforts and communication.
Improving the quality of exchanges reduces the risk of miscommunication or misconception between engineers and managers, which are known to be major sources of design errors in complex system engineering.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = http://www.cmla.ens-cachan.fr/servlet/com.univ.collaboratif.utils.LectureFichiergw?CODE_FICHIER=1446554003051&amp;ID_FICHE=161174|title = The Benefits and Challenges of Massive Behavioural Simulation in the Engineering of Complex and Critical Cyber-Physical &amp; Human Systems|last = Thuy|first = Nguyen|date = October 2015|journal = 3rd International Workshop on Simulation at the System Level (Sim@SL)|doi = |pmid = |access-date = November 17, 2015|publication-date = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

More generally SLS must be contemplated for all applications whenever only the simulation of the whole system is meaningful, while the computation times are constrained.
For instance, simulators for plant [[Operator Training Simulator|operators training]] must imitate the behavior of the whole plant while the simulated time must run faster than real time.

== Modeling choices ==
Cyber-physical systems are [[hybrid system]]s, i.e. they exhibit a mix of discrete and continuous dynamics.
The discrete dynamics mostly originates from digital sensing or computational sub-systems (e.g. controllers, computers,  [[Digital-to-analog converter|signal converters]]).
The adopted models must consequently be capable of modeling such a hybrid behavior.

It is common in SLS to use [[Lumped element model|0D]] —sometimes 1D— equations to model physical phenomena with space variables, instead of 2D or 3D equations. The reason for such a choice is the size of the simulated systems, which is generally too large (i.e. too many elements and/or too large space extension) for the simulation to be computationally tractable. Another reason is that 3D models require the detailed geometry of each part to be modeled. This detailed knowledge might not be known to the modeler, especially if he/she works at an early step in the development process.

The complexity of large CPSs make them difficult to describe and visualize. A representation that can be arranged so that its structure looks like the structure of the original system
is a great help in terms of legibility and ease of comprehension. Therefore, acausal modeling is generally preferred to causal block-diagram modeling.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title = Block Diagrams vs. Acausal Modeling|url = https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-1-4615-1561-6_11|publisher = Springer US|date = 2001-01-01|isbn = 978-1-4613-5615-8|pages = 255–264|series = The Springer International Series in Engineering and Computer Science|doi = 10.1007/978-1-4615-1561-6_11|first = Michael|last = Tiller}}&lt;/ref&gt; Acausal modeling is also
preferred because component models can be reused, contrary to models developed as block diagrams.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Usages ==
In an early stage of the development cycle, SLS can be used for dimensioning or to test different designs.
For instance, in automotive applications, ''"engineers use simulation to refine the specification before building a physical test vehicle"''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Optimizing Vehicle Suspension Design Through System-Level Simulation|url = http://www.mathworks.com/company/newsletters/articles/optimizing-vehicle-suspension-design-through-system-level-simulation.html?s_tid=gn_loc_drop|website = www.mathworks.com|accessdate = 2015-11-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Engineers run simulations with this system-level model to verify performance against requirements and to optimize tunable parameters.

System-level simulation is used to test controllers connected to the simulated system instead of the real one.
If the controller is a hardware controller like an [[Electronic control unit|ECU]], the method is called [[Hardware-in-the-loop simulation|hardware-in-the-loop]]. If the controller is run as a computer program on an ordinary PC, the method is called software-in-the-loop. Software-in-the-loop is faster to deploy and releases the constraint of real time imposed by the use of a hardware controller.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = https://www.qtronic.de/en/sil.html|title = Software in the Loop Simulation|date = |accessdate = |website = QTronic|publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

SLS is used to build plant models that can be simulated fast enough to be integrated in an operator training simulator or in an [[Model predictive control|MPC]] controller.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = A framework for nonlinear model-predictive control using object-oriented modeling with a case study in power plant start-up|url = http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/lpdocs/epic03/wrapper.htm?arnumber=6663487|journal = 2013 IEEE Conference on Computer Aided Control System Design (CACSD)|date = 2013-08-01|pages = 346–351|doi = 10.1109/CACSD.2013.6663487|first = P.-O.|last = Larsson|first2 = F.|last2 = Casella|first3 = F.|last3 = Magnusson|first4 = J.|last4 = Andersson|first5 = M.|last5 = Diehl|first6 = J.|last6 = Akesson}}&lt;/ref&gt; Systems with a faster dynamics can also be simulated, like a vehicle in a driving simulator.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = MapleSim used in the creation of breakthrough vehicle driving simulator technology - User Case Studies - Maplesoft|url = http://www.maplesoft.com/company/casestudies/stories/137744.aspx|website = www.maplesoft.com|accessdate = 2015-11-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another example of SLS use is to couple the system-level simulation to a [[Computational fluid dynamics|CFD]] simulation.
The system-level model provides the boundary conditions of the fluid domain in the CFD model.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = https://www.modelica.org/events/modelica2011/Proceedings/pages/papers/11_3_ID_129_a_fv.pdf|title = Strong Coupling of Modelica System-Level Models with Detailed CFD Models for Transient Simulation of Hydraulic Components|last = Viel|first = Antoine|date = March 2011|journal = Proceedings 8th Modelica Conference|doi = |pmid = |access-date = November 17, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Methods and tools ==
Specific languages are used to model specification and requirement modeling, like [[Systems Modeling Language|SysML]] or FORM-L.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Formal Requirements Modeling for Simulation-Based Verification|url = http://www.ep.liu.se/ecp_article/index.en.aspx?issue=118;article=67|publisher = Linköping University Electronic Press|journal = Proceedings of the 11th International Modelica Conference, Versailles, France, September 21–23, 2015|doi = 10.3384/ecp15118625|first = Martin|last = Otter|first2 = Nguyen|last2 = Thuy|first3 = Daniel|last3 = Bouskela|first4 = Lena|last4 = Buffoni|first5 = Hilding|last5 = Elmqvist|first6 = Peter|last6 = Fritzson|first7 = Alfredo|last7 = Garro|first8 = Audrey|last8 = Jardin|first9 = Hans|last9 = Olsson |first10 = Andrea|last10 = Tundis}}&lt;/ref&gt; They are not meant to model the system physics but tools exist that can combine specification models and multi-physics models written in hybrid system modeling languages like Modelica.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Towards Unified System Modeling and Simulation with ModelicaML: Modeling of Executable Behavior Using Graphical Notations|url = http://www.ep.liu.se/ecp_article/index.en.aspx?issue=043;article=70|publisher = Linköping University Electronic Press|journal = Proceedings of the 7 International Modelica Conference Como, Italy|doi = 10.3384/ecp09430081|first = Wladimir|last = Schamai|first2 = Peter|last2 = Fritzson|first3 = Chris|last3 = Paredis|first4 = Adrian|last4 = Pop|citeseerx = 10.1.1.364.1268}}&lt;/ref&gt;

If a model is too complex or too large to be simulated in a reasonable time, mathematical techniques can be utilized to simplify the model. For instance, [[model order reduction]] gives an approximate model, which has a lower accuracy but can be computed in a shorter time.
Reduced order models can be obtained from finite element models,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = http://modelreduction.com/doc/papers/rudnyi09automation.pdf|title = From Finite Elements to System Level Simulation by means of Model Reduction|last = Rudnyi|first = Evgenii B.|date = June 2009|journal = Automation 2009, 6. und 17. Juni 2009, Kongresshaus Baden-Baden, VDI Bericht|doi = |pmid = |access-date = November 17, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and have been successfully used for system-level simulation of [[Microelectromechanical systems|MEMS]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Wiley: System-level Modeling of MEMS, Volume 10 - Gabriele Schrag, Oliver Brand, Gary K. Fedder, et al|url = http://eu.wiley.com/WileyCDA/WileyTitle/productCd-3527319034.html|website = eu.wiley.com|accessdate = 2015-11-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

SLS can benefit from [[parallel computing]] architectures.
For instance, existing algorithms to generate code from high-level modeling languages can be adapted to multi-core processors like [[Graphics processing unit|GPUs]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = http://www.diva-portal.org/smash/get/diva2:457587/FULLTEXT01.pdf|title = Contributions to Parallel Simulation of Equation-Based Models on Graphics Processing Units|last = Stavåker|first = Kristian|date = 2011|journal = Licentiate thesis No 1507, Department of Computer and Information Science, Linköping University|doi = |pmid = |access-date = November 17, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Parallel co-simulation is another approach to enable numerical integration speed-ups.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Fast multi-core co-simulation of Cyber-Physical Systems: Application to internal combustion engines|url = http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1569190X14000665|journal = Simulation Modelling Practice and Theory|date = 2014-09-01|pages = 79–91|volume = 47|doi = 10.1016/j.simpat.2014.05.002|first = Abir|last = Ben Khaled|first2 = Mongi|last2 = Ben Gaid|first3 = Nicolas|last3 = Pernet|first4 = Daniel|last4 = Simon}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this approach, the global system is partitioned into sub-systems. The subsystems are integrated independently of each other and are synchronized at discrete synchronization points. Data exchange between subsystems occurs only at the synchronization points. This results in a loose coupling between the sub-systems.

Optimization can be used to identify unknown system parameters, i.e. to calibrate CPS model, matching the performance to actual system operation&lt;ref name="wheel"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Ali |first1=Muzaffar |last2=Vukovic |first2=Vladimir |last3=Sahir |first3=Mukhtar Hussain |last4=Basciotti |first4=Daniele |title=Development and validation of a desiccant wheel model calibrated under transient operating conditions |journal=Applied Thermal Engineering |date=2013 |volume=61 |issue=2 |pages=469-480 |doi=10.1016/j.applthermaleng.2013.08.010 |url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1359431113005826?via%3Dihub}}&lt;/ref&gt;. In cases when exact physical equations governing the processes are unknown, approximate empirical equations can be derived, e.g. using multiple linear regression&lt;ref name="system"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Ali |first1=Muzaffar |last2=Vukovic |first2=Vladimir |last3=Sheikh |first3=Nadeem Ahmed |last4=Ali |first4=Hafiz M. |last5=Sahir |first5=Mukhtar Hussain |title=Enhancement and integration of desiccant evaporative cooling system model calibrated and validated under transient operating conditions |journal=Applied Thermal Engineering |date=2015 |volume=75 |pages=1093-1105 |doi=10.1016/j.applthermaleng.2014.10.064 |url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1359431114009351?via%3Dihub}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

== Possible future evolutions ==
If the simulation can be deployed on a supercomputing architecture, many of the modeling choices that are commonly adopted today (see [[#Modeling choices|above]]) might become obsolete.
For instance, the future [[Exascale computing|supercomputers]] might be able to ''"move beyond the loosely coupled, forward-simulation paradigm"''.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Applied Mathematics Research for Exascale Computing|osti=1149042|date = 2014-02-07|location = Livermore, CA|doi = 10.2172/1149042|first = J.|last = Dongarra|first2 = J.|last2 = Hittinger|first3 = J.|last3 = Bell|first4 = L.|last4 = Chacon|first5 = R.|last5 = Falgout|first6 = M.|last6 = Heroux|first7 = P.|last7 = Hovland|first8 = E.|last8 = Ng|first9 = C.|last9 = Webster}}&lt;/ref&gt; In particular, ''"exascale computing will enable a more holistic treatment of complex problems"''.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; To exploit exascale computers, it will however be necessary to rethink the design of today's simulation algorithms.

For [[embedded system]] applications, safety considerations will probably lead the evolution of SLS. For instance, unlike [[Synchronous programming language|synchronous languages]], the modeling languages currently used for SLS (see [[#Methods and tools|above]]) are not predictable and may exhibit unexpected behaviors. It is then not possible to use them in a safety-critical context.
The languages should be rigorously formalized first.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Towards a Formalized Modelica Subset|url = http://www.ep.liu.se/ecp_article/index.en.aspx?issue=118;article=68|publisher = Linköping University Electronic Press|journal = Proceedings of the 11th International Modelica Conference, Versailles, France, September 21–23, 2015|doi = 10.3384/ecp15118637|first = Lucas|last = Satabin|first2 = Jean-Louis|last2 = Colaço|first3 = Olivier|last3 = Andrieu|first4 = Bruno|last4 = Pagano}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some recent languages combine the syntax of synchronous languages for programming discrete components with the syntax of equation-based languages for writing [[Ordinary differential equation|ODEs]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = https://hal.inria.fr/hal-00909029/document|title = Zélus: A Synchronous Language with ODEs|last = Bourke|first = Timothy|date = April 2013|journal = Proceedings of the 16th International Conference on Hybrid systems: computation and control|doi = |pmid = |access-date = November 17, 2015|last2 = Pouzet|first2 = Marc|publisher = ACM|pages = 113–118}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Text linguistics''' is a branch of [[linguistics]] that deals with [[Textuality|text]]s as [[communication system]]s. Its original aims lay in uncovering and describing text [[grammar]]s. The application of text linguistics has, however, evolved from this approach to a point in which text is viewed in much broader terms that go beyond a mere extension of traditional grammar towards an entire text. Text linguistics takes into account the form of a text, but also its setting, i. e. the way in which it is situated in an interactional, communicative context. Both the author of a (written or spoken) text as well as its [[addressee]] are taken into consideration in their respective (social and/or institutional) roles in the specific communicative context. In general it is an application of [[discourse analysis]]&lt;ref&gt;Trappes-Lomax, Hugh (2004) "Discourse analysis", in ''The Handbook of Applied Linguistics'' ed. by A. Davies &amp; C. Elder. Oxford: Blackwell, pp. 133–64.&lt;/ref&gt; at the much broader level of text, rather than just a sentence or word.

==Introduction==
===Reasons for text linguistics===
Much attention has been given to the [[sentence (linguistics)|sentence]] as a self-contained unit, and not enough has been given to studying how sentences may be used in connected stretches of language. It is essentially the presentation of language as sets of sentences.

Text is extremely significant in [[human communication|communication]] because people communicate not by means of individual words or fragments of sentences in languages, but by means of texts. It is also the basis of various disciplines such as law, religion, medicine, science, politics, et cetera.&lt;ref name="sauduniversity"&gt;{{cite web|last=Al-Amri|first=K. H.|title=Text-linguistics for students of translation|url=http://faculty.ksu.edu.sa/kamri/Pages/Text-linguistics.aspx|publisher=King Saud University|year=2007|accessdate=10 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Definitions===
"A text is an extended structure of [[syntactic unit]]s [i. e. text as super-sentence] such as words, groups, and clauses and textual units that is marked by both [[Coherence (linguistics)|coherence]] among the elements and completion ... [Whereas] a non-text consists of random sequences of linguistic units such as sentences, paragraphs, or sections in any temporal and/or spatial extension." (Werlich, 1976: 23)&lt;ref&gt;Werlich, E. (1976), ''A text grammar of English.'' Heidelberg: Quelle &amp; Meyer.&lt;/ref&gt;

"A naturally occurring manifestation of language, i. e. as a communicative language event in a context. The ''surface text'' is the set of expressions actually used; these expressions make some knowledge ''[[explicit knowledge|explicit]]'', while other knowledge remains ''[[implicit knowledge|implicit]]'', though still applied during processing." (Beaugrande and Dressler, 1981: 63)&lt;ref name='introtext'&gt; De Beaugrande, R., &amp; Dressler, W. U. (1981) ''Introduction to text linguistics'' / Robert-Alain De Beaugrande, Wolfgang Ulrich Dressler. London ; New York : Longman, 1981.&lt;/ref&gt;

"[A term] used in linguistics to refer to any passage- spoken or written, of whatever length, that does form a unified whole [….] A text is a unit of language in use. It is not a grammatical unit, like a [[clause]] or a sentence; and it is not defined by its size [….] A text is best regarded as a ''semantic'' unit; a unit not of form but of meaning." (Halliday and Hasan, 1976: 1–2)&lt;ref&gt;Halliday, M.A.K. and Hasan, R. (1976)  "'Cohesion in English London: Longman'', pp. 1–2&lt;/ref&gt;

"A text is made up of sentences, but there exist separate principles of text-construction, beyond the rules for making sentences." (Fowler, 1991: 59)&lt;ref&gt;Roger Fowler. (1991) ''Language in the News: Discourse and Ideology in the Press.'' London/ New York: Routledge.&lt;/ref&gt;

"[Text is] a set of mutually relevant communicative functions, structured in such a way as to achieve an overall [[rhetorical]] purpose." (Hatim and Mason, 1990)&lt;ref&gt;Hatim, Basil &amp; Ian Mason. (1990) ''Discourse and the Translator''. London: Longman.&lt;/ref&gt;

Text linguists generally agree that text is the natural domain of language, but they still differ in their perspectives of what constitutes a text. This variance is mainly due to the different methods of observations of different linguists, and as such, the definition of text is not yet concrete.&lt;ref name="sauduniversity" /&gt;

===Significance of contexts===
There is a text and there is other text that accompanies it: text that is 'with', namely the [[context (language use)|con-text]]. This notion of what is 'with the text', however, goes beyond what is said and written: it includes other non-verbal signs-on-the total environment in which a text unfolds. (Halliday and Hasan, 1985: 5)&lt;ref&gt;Halliday MAK and R Hasan. (1985) ''Language, Context, and Text: Aspects of Language in a Social-Semiotic Perspective''. Geelong: Deakin University.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Halliday, text is a sign representation of a socio-cultural event embedded in a context of situation. Context of situation is the [[semiotics|semio]]-socio-cultural environment in which the text unfolds. Text and context are so intimately related that neither concept can be comprehended in the absence of the other.

===Three features of context of situation===

====The field of discourse – experiential meaning====
This is the meaning that the social actions and the engagements of the participants are giving to the understanding of the text.&lt;ref name=kavcic&gt;Kavcic, A. (2008) ''Text linguistics''. Informally published manuscript, English and German Studies, Retrieved from www.englistika.info/podatki/3_letnik/besediloslovje-I-izpiski.doc&lt;/ref&gt;

====The tenor of discourse – interpersonal meaning====
This is the meaning that the roles of and relationships among participants give to the understanding of the text. These relationships may be permanent or temporary. The contribution to meaning by social statuses of the participants also fall within this feature.&lt;ref name=kavcic /&gt;

====The mode of discourse – logical meaning====
This is the meaning that the language, written or spoken, gives to the understanding of the text. This includes the symbolic organization of the text, as well as its intended function within the context.&lt;ref name=kavcic /&gt;

===Texture ===
Texture is the basis for unity and semantic interdependence within text. Any text that lacks texture would simply be a bunch of isolated sentences that have no relationship to each other. (Crane, 1994)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=A. Crane|first=Paul|title=Texture in Text: A Discourse Analysis  of a News Article Using  Halliday and Hasan’s Model of Cohesion|url=http://library.nakanishi.ac.jp/kiyou/gaidai(30)/08.pdf|accessdate=10 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; A feature of texture is "sequential implicativeness", as suggested by Schegloff and Sacks (1974). This refers to the property of language such that each line in a text is linked from or linked to the previous line. As such, language contains a linear sequence and this linear progression of text creates a context of meaning.&lt;ref name='ss'&gt;Schegloff, E.A. and Sacks, H. (1974) "Opening up Closings", ''Semiotica'' 7(4): 289–327 (reprinted in Turner, R 1974 "'Ethnomethodology: selected readings,'" Harmondsworth: Penguin)&lt;/ref&gt; This contextual meaning, at the paragraph level is referred to as "coherence", while the internal properties of meaning are referred to as "cohesion". (Eggins, 1994: 85)&lt;ref name='eggins'&gt;Eggins, S. (1994) ''An Introduction to Systemic Functional Linguistics'' London: Pinter&lt;/ref&gt; There are two aspects of coherence, namely, "situational" coherence and "generic" coherence. There is situational coherence when field, tenor, and mode can be identified for a certain group of clauses. On the other hand, there is generic coherence when the text can be recognized as belonging to a certain genre. Thereby, cohesion is the result of "semantic ties", which refers to the dependent links between items within a text. These ties come together to create meaning. Texture is, therefore, created within text when the properties of coherence and cohesion are present.

===Text types===
Most linguists agree on the classification into five text-types: narrative, descriptive, argumentative, instructive, and comparison/contrast (also called expositive). Some classifications divide the types of texts according to their function. Others differ because they take into consideration the topic of the texts, the producer and the addressee, or the style. Adam and Petitjean, (1989) proposed analyzing of overlaps of different text types with text sequences. Virtanen (1992) establishes a double classification (discourse type and text type) to be used when the Identification text-text type is not straightforward.&lt;ref name="lopezmedina"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Medina|first=Beatriz López|title=The role of text linguistics in the foreign language class|journal=Encuentro Revista de investigación e innovación en la clase de idiomas|year=2002/2003|pages=148–156|url=http://www.encuentrojournal.org/textos/13.14.pdf|accessdate=10 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Structure==
As a science of text, text linguistics describes or explains among different types of text the:
* Shared features
* Distinct features
Text linguistics is the study of how texts function in human interaction. Beaugrande and Dressler define a text as a “communicative occurrence which meets seven standards of textuality” – Cohesion, Coherence, Intentionality, Acceptability, Informativity, Situationality and Intertextuality, without any of which the text will not be communicative. Non-communicative texts are treated as non-texts.&lt;ref name=introtext /&gt;

===Cohesion===
Surface texts are the exact words that people see or hear. [[Cohesion (linguistics)|Cohesion]] concerns the ways in which the components of the surface text are connected within a sequence. Grammatical forms and conventions are adhered to by surface components and therefore cohesion rests upon grammatical dependencies. The grammatical dependencies in surface texts are major signals for sorting out meanings and uses. Cohesion encompasses all of the functions that can be used to signal relations among surface elements.
{{cquote| SLOW &lt;br&gt;
CARS &lt;br&gt;
HELD UP}}
Such a text can be divided up into various dependencies. Someone might construe it as a notice about "slow cars" that are "held up", so that conclusions could be drawn about the need to drive fast to avoid being held up. However, it is more likely for one to divide the text into "slow" and "cars held up', so that drivers will drive slowly to avoid accidents or take alternative routes to avoid being caught in the slow traffic. A science of text should explain how [[ambiguities]] such as this are possible, as well as how they are precluded or resolved without much difficulty. For efficient communication to take place there must be interaction between cohesion and other standards of textuality because the surface alone is not decisive.

===Coherence===
[[Coherence (linguistics)|Coherence]] concerns the ways in which concepts and relations, which underlie the surface text, are linked, relevant and used, to achieve efficient communication.
* A concept is a cognitive content which can be retrieved or triggered with a high degree of [[consistency]] in the mind
* Relations are the links between concepts within a text, with each link identified with the concept that it connects to
Surface texts may not always express relations explicitly therefore people supply as many relations as are needed to make sense out of any particular text. In the example of the road sign "SLOW CARS HELD UP', "cars" is an object concept and "held up" an action concept, and the "cars" are the link to "held up'. Therefore, "slow" is more likely to be interpreted as a motion than as the speed at which cars are travelling.
Types of relations include:

;I. [[Causality]]: {{quote|"Itsy Bitsy spider climbing up the spout. Down came the rain and washed the spider out."}} The event of "raining" causes the event of "washing the spider out" because it creates the necessary conditions for the latter; without the rain, the spider will not be washed out.

;II. Enablement: {{quote|"Humpty Dumpty sat on the wall, Humpty Dumpty had a great fall."}} The action of sitting on the wall created the necessary but not sufficient conditions for the action of falling down. Sitting on a wall makes it possible but not obligatory for falling down to occur.

;III. Reason: {{quote|"Jack shall have but a penny a day because he can't work any faster."}} In contrast to the rain which causes Itsy Bitsy spider to be washed out, the slow working does not actually cause or enable the low wage. Instead, the low wage is a reasonable outcome; "reason" is used to term actions that occur as a rational response to a previous event.

;IV. Purpose: {{quote|"Old Mother Hubbard went to the cupboard to get her poor dog a bone."}} In contrast to Humpty Dumpty's action of sitting on the wall which enables the action of falling down, there is a plan involved here; Humpty Dumpty did not sit on the wall so that it could fall down but Old Mother Hubbard went to the cupboard so that she could get a bone. "Purpose" is used to term events that are planned to be made possible via a previous event.

;V. Time: 
"Cause", "enablement" and "reason" have forward directionality with the earlier event causing, enabling or providing reason for the later event. "Purpose', however, has a backward directionality as the later event provides the purpose for the earlier event.

More than just a feature of texts, coherence is also the outcome of cognitive processes among text users. The nearness and proximity of events in a text will trigger operations which recover or create coherence relations.
:{{quote|"The Queen of Hearts, she made some tarts;&lt;br&gt;The Knave of Hearts, he stole the tarts; &lt;br&gt;The King of Hearts, called for the tarts."}}

In the explicit text, there is a set of actions (making, stealing and calling); the only relations presented are the agent and the affected entity of each action. However, a text receiver is likely to assume that the locations of all three events are close to one another as well as occur in a continuous and relatively short time frame. One might also assume that the actions are meant to signal the attributes of the agents; the Queen is skilled in cooking, the Knave is dishonest and the King is authoritative. As such, coherence encompasses inferencing based on one's knowledge.

For a text to make sense, there has to be interaction between one's accumulated knowledge and the text-presented knowledge. Therefore, a science of texts is probabilistic instead of deterministic, that is, inferences by users of any particular text will be similar most of the time instead of all of the time. Most text users have a common core of cognitive composition, engagement and process such that their interpretations of texts through "sensing" are similar to what text senders intend them to be. Without cohesion and coherence, communication would be slowed down and could break down altogether. Cohesion and coherence are text-centred notions, designating operations directed at the text materials.

===Intentionality===
Intentionality concerns the text producer's attitude and intentions as the text producer uses cohesion and coherence to attain a goal specified in a plan. Without cohesion and coherence, intended goals may not be achieved due to a breakdown of communication. However, depending on the conditions and situations in which the text is used, the goal may still be attained even when cohesion and coherence are not upheld.
{{cquote| "'Want I carry you on my back?'" }}
Even though cohesion is not maintained in this example, the text producer still succeeds in achieving the goal of finding out if the text receiver wanted a piggyback.

===Acceptability===
Acceptability concerns the text receiver's attitude that the text should constitute useful or relevant details or information such that it is worth accepting. Text type, the desirability of goals and the political and sociocultural setting, as well as cohesion and coherence are important in influencing the acceptability of a text.

Text producers often speculate on the receiver's attitude of acceptability and present texts that maximizes the probability that the receivers will respond as desired by the producers. For example, texts that are open to a wide range of interpretations, such as "Call us before you dig. You may not be able to afterwards," require more inferences about the related consequences. This is more effective than an explicit version of the message that informs receivers the full consequences of digging without calling because receivers are left with a large amount of uncertainty as to the consequences that could result; this plays to the risk averseness of people.

===Informativity===
[[Informativity]] concerns the extent to which the contents of a text are already known or expected as compared to unknown or unexpected. No matter how expected or predictable content may be, a text will always be informative at least to a certain degree due to unforeseen variability. The processing of highly informative text demands greater cognitive ability but at the same time is more interesting. The level of informativity should not exceed a point such that the text becomes too complicated and communication is endangered. Conversely, the level of informativity should also not be so low that it results in boredom and the rejection of the text.

===Situationality===
[[Situationality]] concerns the factors which make a text relevant to a situation of occurrence. The situation in which a text is exchanged influences the comprehension of the text. There may be different interpretations with the road sign
{{cquote|SLOW &lt;br&gt;
CARS&lt;br&gt;
HELD UP}}
However, the most likely interpretation of the text is obvious because the situation in which the text is presented provides the context which influences how text receivers interpret the text. The group of receivers (motorists) who are required to provide a particular action will find it more reasonable to assume that "slow" requires them to slow down rather than referring to the speed of the cars that are ahead. Pedestrians can tell easily that the text is not directed towards them because varying their speeds is inconsequential and irrelevant to the situation. In this way, the situation decides the sense and use of the text.

Situationality can affect the means of cohesion; less cohesive text may be more appropriate than more cohesive text depending on the situation. If the road sign was "Motorists should reduce their speed and proceed slowly because the vehicles ahead are held up by road works, therefore proceeding at too high a speed may result in an accident', every possible doubt of intended receivers and intention would be removed. However, motorists only have a very short amount of time and attention to focus on and react to road signs. Therefore, in such a case, economical use of text is much more effective and appropriate than a fully cohesive text.

===Intertextuality===
[[Intertextuality]] concerns the factors which make the utilization of one text dependent upon knowledge of one or more previously encountered text. If a text receiver does not have prior knowledge of a relevant text, communication may break down because the understanding of the current text is obscured. Texts such as parodies, rebuttals, forums and classes in school, the text producer has to refer to prior texts while the text receivers have to have knowledge of the prior texts for communication to be efficient or even occur. In other text types such as puns, for example "Time flies like an arrow; fruit flies like a banana', there is no need to refer to any other text.

===Robert-Alain de Beaugrande===
[[Robert-Alain de Beaugrande]] was a text linguist and a discourse analyst, one of the leading figures of the Continental tradition in the discipline. He was one of the developers of the Vienna School of Textlinguistik (Department of Linguistics at the University of Vienna), and published the seminal ''Introduction to Text Linguistics'' in 1981, with [[Wolfgang U. Dressler]]. He was also a major figure in the consolidation of critical discourse analysis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Beaugrande|first=Robert de|title=Robert de Beaugrande Homepage|url=http://www.beaugrande.com/|accessdate=10 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Application to language learning==

Text linguistics stimulates reading by arousing interest in texts or novels. Increases background knowledge on literature and on different kinds of publications. Writing skills can be improved by familiarizing and duplicating specific text structures and the use of specialized vocabulary.&lt;ref name="lopezmedina" /&gt;

'''Women's Studio Workshop (WSW)''' is a nonprofit visual [[arts studio]] and [[private press]] offering residencies and educational workshops, located in [[Rosendale, New York]].

The workshop was founded in 1974 by Ann Kalmbach, [[Tatana Kellner]], Anita Wetzel, and Barbara Leoff Burge as an alternative space for female artists to create new work, gain artistic experience, and develop new skills. The studio operates throughout the year with artist residencies, gallery exhibitions, artist lectures, and diverse educational programs for children and adults. In addition, they operate a Summer Art Institute which includes options to study abroad. The studio supports projects in a wide range of media types, with a focus on [[Book Art|book arts]], [[Paper making|papermaking]], and printmaking methods: [[screen printing]], [[letterpress]], [[etching]], [[intaglio (printmaking)|intaglio]]. 

WSW is the largest publisher of [[Artist's book|artists' books]] in North America. {{CN|date=August 2018}} The workshop is represented in book arts and special collections of notable libraries, such as the [[Library of Congress]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title=Library of Congress Acquires Rosendale Women’s Studio Handmade Book Collection. | date=6 June  2013 | type=Print  | newspaper=Hudson Valley Business Journal | pages=2–4}}&lt;/ref&gt; the [[National Museum of Women in the Arts]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Book as Art: Artists' Books from the National Museum of Women in the Arts|publisher=Princeton Architectural Press|location=New York|isbn=9781568989921|pages=79–81|author=Krystyna Wasserman|author2=Joanna Drucker |author3=Audrey Audrey Niffenegger |type=Print}}&lt;/ref&gt; the Dexter Library, [[Maryland Institute College of Art]], and James Branch Cabell Library, [[Virginia Commonwealth University]].[http://www.library.vcu.edu/research/special-collections/cabell/book-art/] Editions by visiting artists published by the Women's Studio Workshop&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Hand, voice &amp; vision : artists' books from Women's Studio Workshop|year=2010|publisher=Women's Studio Workshop,|location=Rosendale, N.Y.|url=http://handvoicevision.com/|author=Kathy Walkup|author2=Grolier Club. |accessdate=1 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  have been featured in overview exhibitions and symposiums on contemporary book arts such as the Codex Book Fair and Symposium,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Book art object|publisher=Codex Foundation|pages=355–357; 382;417|author=David Jury|author2=Peter Rutledge Koch |year=2008|type=Print}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Pyramid Atlantic]] Book Arts Fair.

== The Artists' Book Collection ==
The artists' books produced at the studio cover a range of topics from the political to the personal. The books come in a variety of forms, ranging from interactive puzzles that must be assembled to accordion folded books to books made with a variety of mixed media.

'''Žemaičių Alkas''' ('''Samogitian sanctuary''') is a [[pagan sanctuary]] in [[Lithuania]], a reconstruction of a medieval [[pagan observatory]]. The poles corresponding to the gods and goddesses of the Balts can be used to observe the main calendar holidays.&lt;ref name="visitlithuania"&gt;[http://www.visitlithuania.net/routes/amber-road/798-emaii-alkas Visit Lithuania - Žemaičių Alkas]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://zemaitiualka.lt/ Žemaičių Alkas]&lt;/ref&gt;

The structure is located in the northern part on [[Šventoji, Lithuania]]. It is based on archeological records of the paleoastronomic observatory and pagan shrine that existed on Birutė Hill in [[Palanga]] until the 16th century. The wooden poles were carved by Lithuanian folk artists and were installed in June 1998.&lt;ref name="visitlithuania" /&gt; [[Modern Paganism|Neopagans]] use the sanctuary for devotional ceremonies during the major holidays.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.truelithuania.com/sventoji-resort-328 Šventoji Resort].
