'''Bengt-Åke Knud Madsen''' (born 5 October 1942&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.expressen.se/sport/fotboll/allsvenskan/bengt-madsen-jag-ar-ledsen-over-pahoppen/|title= Bengt Madsen: "Jag är ledsen över påhoppen"|date=17 January 2010|accessdate=25 June 2012 |work=expressen.se|publisher= Expressen|language = Swedish}}&lt;/ref&gt;) is a Swedish former [[Football (Soccer)|football]] chairman for the Swedish club [[Malmö FF]], a post he held between 1999 and 2009.&lt;ref name="Facts"&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.mff.se/Ditt_MFF/Om_klubben/Styrelse/Bengt%20Madsen.aspx|title= Bengt Madsen|accessdate= 25 June 2012|work= mff.se|publisher= Malmö FF|language= Swedish|deadurl= yes|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20121028185747/http://www.mff.se/Ditt_MFF/Om_klubben/Styrelse/Bengt%20Madsen.aspx|archivedate= 28 October 2012|df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Madsen is most renowned for leading the club from their first relegation in 65 years in 1999 to their first [[List of Swedish football champions|Swedish championship]] in 16 years in 2004. He also had a prominent role in Malmö FF moving from [[Malmö Stadion]] to [[Stadion (Malmö)|Stadion]]. Madsen is also famous for being a controversial figure in the sport such as an incident in 2002 when Madsen verbally criticized referee [[Anders Frisk]] in half-time in an [[Allsvenskan]] match between Malmö FF and [[Hammarby IF]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://sverigesradio.se/sida/artikel.aspx?programid=96&amp;artikel=109563|title= MFFs Bengt Madsen i blåsväder|date=27 August 2002|accessdate=25 June 2012 |work=sverigesradio.se|publisher= Sveriges Radio|language = Swedish}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==

===Sports career===
As a young football player Madsen played at Håkanstorps BK scoring 67 goals in 24 games, as of 2009 still holding the goal record at the club. After this he was noticed by Malmö FF who signed him. In Malmö FF he played with legends such as [[Bo Larsson]] and [[Krister Kristensson]]. After realising that he would not make it to the first team he accepted an offer to start a [[table tennis]] section at the club in 1975. The section was very successful and went from playing in the 6th division to becoming Swedish champions in just nine years.

===Chairman of Malmö FF===
In 1999, he was appointed chairman of Malmö FF, replacing [[Hans Cavalli-Björkman]], who had been chairman since 1975 when he took the position over from club legend [[Eric Persson]]. In 2009 Madsen announced that he would step down as chairman before he reaches the age of 70.&lt;ref name="Facts" /&gt; He announced his decision to not seek re-election as chairman another year and thus his resignation on 14 January 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mff.se/Aktuellt/Nyheter/2010-01-14_Madsen.aspx |title=Bengt Madsen ställer inte upp för omval |date=14 January 2010 |accessdate=25 June 2012 |work=mff.se |publisher=Malmö FF |language=Swedish |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120523040829/http://mff.se/Aktuellt/Nyheter/2010-01-14_Madsen.aspx |archivedate=23 May 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; On 18 February 2010 [[Håkan Jeppsson]] was named as Madsen's successor as chairman.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.sydsvenskan.se/sport/fotboll/mff/hakan-jeppsson-tar-over-mff/|title= Håkan Jeppsson tar över MFF|date=19 February 2010|accessdate=25 June 2012 |work=sydsvenskan.se|publisher= Sydsvenskan|language = Swedish}}&lt;/ref&gt; The club won one [[Allsvenskan|Swedish championship]] during Madsen's time as chairman; this happened in 2004. Outside Malmö FF, Madsen has had a successful business career until his retirement in later years.

==Honours won by club during presidency==
*[[Allsvenskan]]:
**Winners (1): [[2004 Allsvenskan|2004]]

'''Biogen Inc.''' (previously known as '''Biogen Idec''') is an American [[multinational corporation|multinational]] [[biotechnology]] company based in [[Cambridge, Massachusetts]], specializing in the discovery, development, and delivery of therapies for the treatment of [[neurodegenerative]], [[hematologic]], and [[autoimmune diseases]] to patients worldwide.

== History ==
Biogen was founded in 1978 in [[Geneva]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url        = https://www.forbes.com/sites/matthewherper/2012/12/04/biogen-idec-biotechs-comeback-kid/ |title      = Biotech's Comeback Kid |publisher  = Forbes |accessdate=2012-12-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; by several prominent biologists, including [[Kenneth Murray (biologist)|Kenneth Murray]] of the [[University of Edinburgh]], [[Phillip Allen Sharp]] of the [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]], [[Walter Gilbert]] of [[Harvard]] (who served as CEO during the start-up phase), [[Heinz Schaller]], [[University of Heidelberg]] and [[Charles Weissmann]], [[University of Zurich]] (who contributed the first product [[interferon alpha]]). Gilbert and Sharp were subsequently honored with [[Nobel Prize]]s: Gilbert was recognized in 1980 with the [[Nobel Prize in Chemistry]] for his work in understanding [[DNA sequencing]], while Sharp received the [[Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine]] in 1993 for his discovery of [[split gene]]s.

In 2003, Biogen merged with [[San Diego, California]]-based IDEC Pharmaceuticals (formed in 1985 by [[Ivor Royston]], [[Howard Birndorf]] and others) and adopted the name Biogen Idec.&lt;ref name="Exhibit"&gt;{{cite web |title=Biogen and IDEC Pharmaceuticals Announce Merger To Create a New Biotechnology Industry Leader |url=https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/875045/000104746903021993/a2113458zex-99_1.htm|quote="IDEC — Founded in 1985 to develop monoclonal antibodies. Founders include Ivor Royston, Howard Birndorf, Richard Miller and Brook Byers" |website=Exhibit 99.1 |accessdate=1 December 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the merger, Biogen Idec became the 3rd largest Biotechnology company in the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url        = https://www.nytimes.com/2003/06/24/business/idec-to-merge-with-biogen-in-6.8-billion-deal.html|title      = Idec to Merge With Biogen in $6.8 Billion Deal|publisher  = New York Times |accessdate=2003-06-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Following shifts in research core areas, the company has since shortened its name, reverting to simply Biogen.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url        = https://www.wsj.com/articles/biogen-drops-idec-from-name-1427113639|title      = Biogen Drops Idec From Name|publisher  = Wall Street Journal|accessdate=2015-03-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; Biogen stock is a component of several stock indices such as the [[S&amp;P 100]], [[S&amp;P 500]], [[S&amp;P 1500]], and [[NASDAQ-100]] and the company is listed on the [[NASDAQ]] stock exchange under the ticker symbol, BIIB.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url        = http://www.nasdaq.com/symbol/biib|title      = Biogen Idec Inc. Stock Quote &amp; Summary Data|publisher  = NASDAQ}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 2006, the company announced it would acquire cancer specialist, Conforma Therapeutics for $250 million.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.pharmatimes.com/news/biogen_idec_agrees_to_buy_swiss_company_fumapharm_996746|title=Biogen Idec agrees to buy Swiss company Fumapharm|last=PharmaTimes|date=2006-06-01|website=www.pharmatimes.com|language=en|access-date=2017-12-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later in the same month, the company announced its intention to acquire Fumapharm AG, consolidating ownership of [[Fumaderm]] and [[BG-12]], an oral [[fumarate]], which is being studied for the treatment of [[multiple sclerosis]] and [[psoriasis]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20060531005276/en/Biogen-Idec-Acquire-Fumapharm-AG-Consolidates-Ownership|title=Biogen Idec to Acquire Fumapharm AG; Consolidates Ownership of Oral Compound BG-12 Being Studied for Multiple Sclerosis|website=www.businesswire.com|language=en|access-date=2017-12-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 2007, the company announced it would acquire Syntonix Pharmaceuticals for up to $120 million, gaining Syntonix's lead product for hemophilia B as well as the technology for developing inhalable treatments.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.fiercebiotech.com/biotech/biogen-to-buy-syntonix-120m-deal|title=Biogen to buy Syntonix in $120M deal {{!}} FierceBiotech|website=www.fiercebiotech.com|language=en|access-date=2017-12-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20070104005533/en/Biogen-Idec-Acquire-Syntonix|title=Biogen Idec to Acquire Syntonix|website=www.businesswire.com|language=en|access-date=2017-12-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 2013, [[Bloomberg L.P.|Bloomberg]] broke the news that Biogen was planning the pay [[Élan|Elan]] $3.25 billion for the full rights to [[Tysabri]], used to treat multiple sclerosis.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2013-02-06/biogen-to-pay-elan-3-25-billion-for-full-tysabri-rights|title=Biogen to Pay Elan $3.25 Billion for Full Tysabri Rights|date=2013-02-06|work=Bloomberg.com|access-date=2017-12-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 2015 the company announced it will acquire [[Convergence Pharmaceuticals]] for up to $675 million, with the acquisition aiming to accelerate the development of Convergence's pipeline, in-particular [[Raxatrigine|CNV1014802]] – a Phase II small molecule sodium channel blocking candidate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.genengnews.com/gen-news-highlights/biogen-idec-snaps-up-convergence-for-up-to-675m/81250789/|title=Biogen Idec Snaps Up Convergence for Up-to-$675M - GEN News Highlights - GEN|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In October 2015 the company announced it will lay off 11% of its workforce, effective immediately.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.businessinsider.com/biogen-layoffs-cutting-11-of-workforce-2015-10|title=Biogen is cutting 11% of its workforce|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Bioverativ===
In May 2016 the company announced that it will [[Corporate spin-off|spin off]] its hemophilia drug business (Eloctate and Alprolix) into a public company.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-biogen-hemophilia-idUSKCN0XU15E | title=Biogen to spin off hemophilia drug business into a public company | work=Reuters | date=May 3, 2016 | accessdate=May 3, 2016 | author=D'Souza, Savio}}&lt;/ref&gt; In August, the company announced that the spun off company would be called [[Bioverativ]], in order to show heritage with Biogen.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fiercepharma.com/pharma/biogen-introduces-spinoff-bioverativ-amid-takeover-buzz|title=Amid takeover chatter, Biogen introduces hemophilia spinoff Bioverativ  - FiercePharma|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The company will trade on the NASDAQ exchange under the ticker symbol BIVV&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.businesswire.com/news/financialpost/20160809005296/en/Biogen-Announces-Bioverativ-Hemophilia-Focused-Company|title=Biogen Announces Bioverativ as Name of New Hemophilia-Focused Company {{!}} Business Wire|website=www.businesswire.com|language=en|access-date=2017-12-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bostonglobe.com/business/2016/08/09/biogen-unveils-name-for-hemophilia-drug-spinoff-bioverativ/2EjLRgOOGpOZJECl3nO4yH/story.html|title=Biogen unveils name for hemophilia drug spinoff: Bioverativ - The Boston Globe|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and will look to be spun off in early 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://media.biogen.com/press-release/hemophilia-spin/biogen-announces-bioverativ-name-new-hemophilia-focused-company|title=Biogen Announces Bioverativ as Name of New Hemophilia-Focused Company - Biogen Media|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Biogen has focused its R&amp;D efforts on the discovery and development of treatments for patients with high unmet medical needs in the areas of neurology, hematology and immunology.

Investigational MS medicines:

* Daclizumab High-Yield Process (DAC HYP): is being developed as a potential once-monthly subcutaneous injection in the treatment of relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis (RRMS). DAC HYP is being developed in collaboration with [[Abbvie]], Inc. In June 2014, the companies announced positive top-line results from the Phase III DECIDE clinical trial, where DAC HYP demonstrated superiority over interferon beta-1a in annualized relapse rate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

   |title      = Once-monthly MS drug from Biogen Idec, AbbVie clears Phase III hurdle
   |publisher  = Fierce Biotech
   |accessdate=2013-04-08
}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Anti-LINGO-1 (BIIB033) ([[Opicinumab]]): is the first candidate being investigated for its potential to remyelinate and repair neurons damaged by MS, currently in Phase 2 trials.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
   |url        = http://multiple-sclerosis-research.blogspot.com/2013/05/lingo-promising-remyelination-target-in.html
   |title      = Lingo: a promising remyelination target in MS
   |publisher  = Multiple Sclerosis Research
   |accessdate=2014-06-16
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Biogen has several candidates in Phase 1 and 2 clinical trials in neurodegenerative and immunological diseases including MS, Alzheimer's disease, neuropathic pain, spinal muscular atrophy and lupus nephritis:

* Phase 2a: anti-LINGO-1 molecule ([[Opicinumab]]) in acute optic neuritis
* Phase 2b: anti-TWEAK monoclonal antibody in lupus nephritis
* Phase 2a: STX-100 in patients with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis
* Phase 2: Neublastin for neuropathic pain in 2013 
* Phase 3:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

   |title      = Aducanumab Reduces Amyloid Plaques in Early Alzheimer's
   |publisher  = PRIME
   }}&lt;/ref&gt; BIIB037 ([[Aducanumab]]), Biogen's first clinical study in Alzheimer's disease
* Phase 1/2: BIIB067 (ISIS-SOD1&lt;sub&gt;Rx&lt;/sub&gt;) for [[amyotrophic lateral sclerosis]], in collaboration with Ionis

Biogen also has several development agreements in place with Ionis Pharmaceuticals to collaborate to leverage antisense technology in advancing the treatment of neurological disorders.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
   |url        = http://www.fiercebiotech.com/special-reports/top-20-biotech-licensing-deals-h1-2012/isis-pharmaceuticals-and-biogen-idec
   |title      = Isis Pharmaceuticals and Biogen Idec
   |publisher  = Fierce Biotech
   }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 2012, Biogen formalized a joint venture with [[Samsung]], creating Samsung Bioepis. This joint venture brings Biogen's expertise and capabilities in protein engineering, cell line development, and recombinant biologics manufacturing to position the joint venture so Biogen can participate in the emerging market for biosimilars.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

   |publisher  = BusinessWeek
   |accessdate=2013-12-11
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In early 2014, Biogen entered into an agreement with Eisai, Inc., to jointly develop and commercialize two of their candidates for Alzheimer's disease, which have the potential to reduce Aβ plaques that form in the brains of patients, as well as to slow the formation of new plaques, potentially improving symptoms and suppressing disease progression.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
   |url        = http://www.fiercebiotech.com/special-reports/top-20-biotech-licensing-deals-h1-2012/isis-pharmaceuticals-and-biogen-idec
   |title      = Isis Pharmaceuticals and Biogen Idec
   |publisher  = Fierce Biotech
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Biogen also has since 2015 an agreement with AGTC for the development of gene therapy for ophthalmologic diseases such as X-linked retinoschisis (XLRS) and X-linked  Retinitis pigmentosa (XLRP), and up to three other genetic diseases. To this aim, Biogen paid AGTC $124 million, including an equity investment of $30 millions, and up to 1,1 billion in future milestones.&lt;ref&gt;Biogen Offers Up To $1 Billion for AGTC’s Ophthalmology Gene Therapy, Xconomy Boston, David Holley, July 2nd, 2015, http://www.xconomy.com/boston/2015/07/02/biogen-offers-up-to-1-billion-for-agtcs-ophthalmology-gene-therapy/&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5014">The '''Business Anti-Corruption Portal''' (BACP) is a one-stop shop for business anti-corruption information offering tools on how to mitigate risks and costs of corruption when doing business abroad.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iaaca.org/AntiCorruptionAuthorities/ByInternationalOrganizations/NonGovernmentalOrganization/201202/t20120215_805491.shtml |title=Business Anti-Corruption Portal_IAACA |publisher=Iaaca.org |date=2012-02-15 |accessdate=2014-02-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; All the information on the Portal is produced by GAN Integrity Solutions, a [[Denmark]]-based IT &amp; Professional Services firm. The Portal was established in 2006 and is supported by the European Commission and a number of European governments.

The BACP is referred to by several government and non-government organisations, amongst others, the [[Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development]], the [[United Nations]], the OECD Business and Industry Advisory Committee (BIAC), and the [[World Bank]]. In addition, the BACP is the only externally cited tool for anti-corruption risk assessment in the UK [[Bribery Act 2010]] Quick Start Guide.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.justice.gov.uk/downloads/legislation/bribery-act-2010-quick-start-guide.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; The BACP is listed in the [[UN Global Compact]] Anti-Corruption Tools Inventory as an effective resource to help companies address and implement the 10th principle: "Businesses should work against corruption in all its forms, including extortion and bribery."

==Sponsors==

The Business Anti-Corruption Portal is funded by five European governments and the [[EU Commission]]. The five governments are:
* [[Sweden]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.swedenabroad.com/en-GB/Embassies/Istanbul/Business/Business-Anti-Corruption-Portal/ http://www.swedenabroad.com/en-GB/Embassies/Istanbul/Business/Business-Anti-Corruption-Portal]&lt;/ref&gt; 
* [[Austria]]
* [[Germany]]
* [[Norway]]
* The [[United Kingdom]]

==Information and Tools available on the BACP==

===Country profiles===

The BACP offers relevant business analysis of corruption risks and legislative framework in over 100 countries across 6 regions: Europe &amp; Central Asia, South Asia, East Asia &amp; the Pacific, Sub-Saharan Africa, the Middle-East &amp; North Africa, and the Americas. The 33 European country profiles are funded with financial support from the Prevention of and Fight against Crime Programme by the European Commission. Each country profile contains the following information:

* A summary of what is presented in the whole profile, including both positive and negative developments with regards to investment and corruption.
* '''Corruption Levels''': This chapter covers corruption and risk assessments of 8 sectors: the [[judicial system]], the [[police]], public services, [[land administration]], [[tax]] administration, [[customs]] administration, public procurement, and [[natural resource]]s and extractive industry. Each sector covers corruption cases and offers an analysis of general corruption risks relevant for businesses.
* '''Legislation''': This chapter presents information about the anti-corruption legislation and initiatives taken by the respective governments.
* '''Civil Society''': This chapter covers anti-corruption initiatives taken by the non-government organisations, the level of media and civil societal freedom with regards to their fight against corruption, and/or their ability to report corruption.
* '''Information Network''': This chapter aims to provide easy access to contact information of the relevant private anti-corruption organisations and government agencies, as well as a list of the Portal's partner embassies.
* '''Sources''': A list of public available sources used in the production of a country profile.

All the information and sources used for creating the country profiles are publicly available, and the team behind GAN Integrity Solutions updates the country profiles at least once a year. Other tools and information on the Portal are also maintained and updated on regular basis.

==Business tools==

The Portal offers a number of tools that help companies to effectively manage corruption risk, such as:

* '''Due Diligence Tools''': a list of flowcharts developed for agent screening processes, consultant evaluation processes, joint venture consortiums, contractor procedures and public procurement tools.
* '''Anti-Corruption Legislation''':  Quick and practical overview of anti-corruption legislation and treaties that have global reach.
* '''Training''': Free anti-corruption e-learning course to kick start a compliance program.
* '''Compliance System Guidance''': Guide to implementing an effective anti-corruption compliance system.

'''Business failure''' refers to a company ceasing operations following its inability to make a [[profit (accounting)|profit]] or to bring in enough [[revenue]] to cover its expenses. A profitable business can fail if it does not generate adequate [[cash flow]] to meet expenses.&lt;ref&gt;[http://sbinformation.about.com/cs/accounting/a/uccashflow.htm Cash Flow: The 10 Rules of Cash Flow 101&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reasons==
Businesses can fail as a result of [[war]]s, [[recession]]s, high [[tax]]ation, high [[interest rate]]s, excessive [[regulation]]s, poor [[management]] decisions, insufficient [[marketing]], inability to [[Competition (economics)|compete]] with other similar businesses, or a lack of [[Demand|interest from the public in the business's offerings]]. Some businesses may choose to shut down prior to an expected failure. Others may continue to operate until they are forced out by a [[eviction|court order]].

The [[Small Business Administration]], in an article on small business failure,&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | url=http://www.sba.gov/content/what-are-major-reasons-small-business-failure | title = What are the major reasons for small business failure?  | publisher = U.S. Small Business Administration | accessdate = 2013-11-29 }}&lt;/ref&gt; lists additional reasons for failure from Michael Ames book on "Small Business Management":
* lack of experience
*Un-trusted sales representative
* insufficient [[capital (finance)|capital]]
* poor [[inventory]] management
* over-investment in [[fixed asset]]s
*business's [[finance mismanagement]]
*poor business location
*poor credit arrangement management
*unexpected growth{{Clarify|reason=How could growth ''hurt'' a business?|date=November 2018}}
*engaging in the wrong business niche
*inability to recover from a major business interruption
&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | title=Small Business Management | last=Ames | first=Michael | publisher=West Group | year=1983 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A study published in 2014 by the [[Turnaround Management Society]] assesses that most business crises are caused by the mistakes of upper management. The most frequent causes of a crisis are that the management continued with a strategy that was no longer working for the company (54.6%), and that they lost touch with the market and their customers and did not want to adapt to changes occurring around them (51.6%). Having a clear strategy that is communicated well to all operational areas, one that uses and builds USPs,{{definition needed|date=November 2018}} is desirable for every company but is often not the case. Incorrect strategic decisions (39.4%) are often made because of the lack of a clear strategy, and they can have a significant impact on a company’s financial position in the market. &lt;ref&gt;{{citation | title=Why do Companies fail? 2014 Survey Results | publisher = Turnaround Management Society | date=14 February 2014 | url = http://turnaround-society.com/companies-fail-2014-survey-results/ }}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are many opinions about the most important reason that businesses fail:
* Peter Drucker claimed the most important reason that businesses fail is because management didn't ask "what is our business?" in a "clear and sharp form."&lt;ref name=krames2008&gt;{{citation | first=Jeffrey | last=Krames | title=Inside Drucker's Brain | publisher=Portfolio - Penguin Books | year=2008 | isbn = 978-1-59184-222-4 | page = 163}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Eric T. Wagner, who has 30 years experience as a serial entrepreneur, says that entrepreneurs fail when developing new products because they "retreat to a cave" instead of thoroughly understanding their customers' needs. A survey of more than 1000 Australian SME business owners found that business failure was most likely because of an inability to manage costs.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | title=Top reasons for small business failure: Study | publisher = Smart Company | date=12 April 2013 | url = http://www.smartcompany.com.au/growth/31229-top-reasons-for-small-business-failure-study.html }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Dr. Christoph Lymbersky analysed internal causes over a timeline of 38 years which shows that the lack of financial control is becoming less and less relevant as a crisis factor. In 1984 inadequate financial control still contributed to 75 percent of all corporate crises. In his 2014 survey, only 36 percent or restructuring consultants reported inadequate financial control to be a cause of decline. &lt;ref&gt;{{citation | title=Why do Companies fail? 2014 Survey Results | publisher = Turnaround Management Society | date=14 February 2014 | url = http://turnaround-society.com/companies-fail-2014-survey-results/ }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* According to a study by Industry Canada, "the main reason for (business) failure is inexperienced management. Managers of bankrupt firms do not have the experience, knowledge, or vision to run their businesses".&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | url=http://www.statcan.gc.ca/pub/61-525-x/61-525-x1997001-eng.pdf | last=Baldwin | first=John | last2=Gray| first2=Tara | last3=Johnson | first3 = Joanne | last4=Proctor | first4=Jody | last5=Rafiquzzaman | first5=Mohammed | last6=Sabourin | first6=David | year=1997 | title= Failing Concerns: Business Bankruptcy in Canada | publisher = Minister responsible for Statistics Canada | isbn = 0-660-171201 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* M. Victor Janulaitis surveyed 278 organization in 2018 on why disaster recovery and business continuity plans fail and found that after 12 months 51% of small to mid-sized business were not able to re-open their doors.  &lt;ref&gt;{{citation | title=Why Recovery fails? 2018 Survey Results | publisher = Janco Associates, Inc. | date=7 February 2018 | url = https://www.e-janco.com/WhyDRPsFail.htm/ }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==After Closing==
After, a business may be [[dissolution (law)|dissolved]] and have its assets redistributed after filing articles of dissolution.  A business that operates multiple locations may continue to operate, but close some of its locations that are under-performing, or in the case of a manufacturer, cease production of some of its products that are not selling well. Some failing companies are purchased by a new owner who may be able to run the company better, and some are [[Mergers and acquisitions|merged]] with another company that will then take over its operations. Some businesses save themselves through [[bankruptcy]] or bankruptcy protection, thereby allowing themselves to restructure. There are several consequences towards the owners/shareholders, such as limited liability, the finance and the continuity (if a shareholder does not want to continue in the business).

== Life ==
Carl Elsener Jr. is the great-grandson of [[Karl Elsener (inventor)|Karl Elsener]] (1860-1918) and the son of [[Carl Elsener Sr.]] (1922-2013). Karl Elsener had opened a factory in [[Ibach SZ|Ibach]] in 1884&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/obituaries/10139841/Carl-Elsener.html |title=Carl Elsener |date=24 June 2013 |publisher=The Telegraph |access-date=17 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; for the production of knives and [[surgical instrument]]s,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://warfarehistorynetwork.com/daily/military-history/the-swiss-army-knife-is-headed-for-the-u-s-army/ |title=The Swiss Army Knife is Headed For the U.S. Army |date=11 July 2017 |publisher=Warfare History |access-date=17 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; from which the Messerfabrik Victorinox developed.

'''Colin "Tich" Wesley''' (born 5 September 1937 in [[Durban]], [[KwaZulu-Natal Province|Natal]]) is a former [[South Africa]]n [[cricket]]er who played in three [[Test cricket|Tests]] in 1960.

He played [[first-class cricket]] for [[KwaZulu-Natal cricket team|Natal]] from 1957 to 1966 as a middle-order batsman and left-arm spin bowler. He toured England with the [[South African cricket team in England in 1960|South African team in 1960]].

The '''Comprehensive Economic and Trade Agreement''' ('''CETA''') is a [[free-trade agreement]] between [[Canada]], the [[European Union]] and its member states.&lt;ref name="ec"/&gt;&lt;ref name="canada"/&gt;&lt;ref name="GMtentative"&gt;https://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/national/belgians-reach-deal-on-eu-canada-free-trade-agreement/article32542390/&lt;/ref&gt; It has been provisionally applied,&lt;ref&gt;http://trade.ec.europa.eu/doclib/docs/2017/september/tradoc_156062.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; so the [[treaty]] has eliminated 98% of the tariffs between Canada and the EU.

The negotiations were concluded in August 2014. All [[Member state of the European Union|28 European Union member states]] approved the final text of CETA for signature, with [[Belgium]] being the final country to give its approval.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://euobserver.com/economic/135717|title=Belgium green lights unchanged Ceta|access-date=2016-10-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Justin Trudeau]], Prime Minister of Canada, travelled to Brussels on 30 October 2016 to sign on behalf of Canada.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.yorkregion.com/news-story/6934897-trudeau-brussels-bound-to-sign-ceta-on-sunday/|title=Trudeau Brussels-bound to sign CETA on Sunday|last=YorkRegion.com|website=www.yorkregion.com|access-date=2016-10-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The European Parliament approved the deal on 15 February 2017.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{cite news | title=CETA: MEPs back EU-Canada trade agreement | author=Bálint Péter Linder | date=2017-02-15 | publisher=European Parliament Press Service | url=http://www.europarl.europa.eu/news/en/news-room/20170209IPR61728/ceta-meps-back-eu-canada-trade-agreement}}&lt;/ref&gt; The agreement is subject to ratification by the EU and national legislatures&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/national/prime-minister-trudeau-signs-canada-eu-trade-deal-in-brussels/article32586423/|title=Trudeau signs CETA but final ratification still required by European Union|first=Paul|last=Waldie|date=30 October 2016|publisher=|via=The Globe and Mail}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="GMtentative"/&gt; and can only enter into force if no adverse opinion is given by the European Court of Justice following a request for an opinion by Belgium.&lt;ref name=CJEUref/&gt; Until its formal entry into force, substantial parts are provisionally applied from 21 September 2017.&lt;ref name=prov&gt;{{cite web|url=http://europa.eu/rapid/press-release_STATEMENT-17-1959_en.htm|work=European Commission|title=EU and Canada agree to set a date for the provisional application of the Comprehensive Economic and Trade Agreement.

The European Commission indicates the treaty will lead to savings of just over half a billion euros in taxes for EU exporters every year, mutual recognition in regulated professions such as architects, accountants and engineers, and easier transfers of company staff and other professionals between the EU and Canada. The European Commission claims CETA will create a more level playing field between Canada and the EU on intellectual property rights.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://trade.ec.europa.eu/doclib/docs/2016/february/tradoc_154331.pdf|title=What will the EU gain from CETA?|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Proponents of CETA emphasize that the agreement will boost trade between the EU and Canada and thus create new jobs, facilitate business operations by abolishing customs duties, goods checks, and various other levies, facilitate mutual recognition of diplomas and regulate investment disputes by creating a new system of courts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://ec.europa.eu/croatia/news/eu_canada_trade_agreement_enters_into_force_hr|title=Trgovinski sporazum između EU-a i Kanade stupa na snagu—Hrvatska—European Commission|first=Ksenija|last=SKREBLIN|date=20 September 2017|website=Hrvatska—European Commission}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="auto1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dw.com/hr/sporazum-o-slobodnoj-trgovini-ceta/a-40623781|title=Sporazum o slobodnoj trgovini CETA—Gospodarstvo—DW—21.09.2017|first=Deutsche Welle|last=(www.dw.com)|website=DW.COM}}&lt;/ref&gt; Opponents consider that CETA would weaken European consumer rights, including high EU standards concerning [[food safety]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.dw.com/en/gabriel-optimistic-over-eu-canada-ceta-trade-deal/a-36073644|title=Gabriel optimistic over EU-Canada CETA trade deal {{!}} Business {{!}} DW.COM {{!}} 18.10.2016|last=(www.dw.com)|first=Deutsche Welle|website=DW.COM|access-date=2016-10-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; and criticize it as a boon only for [[big business]] and [[multinational corporation]]s, while risking net-losses, unemployment, and environmental damage impacting individual citizens.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-37450742|title=EU Commission refuses to revise Canada Ceta trade deal|date=2016-09-23|newspaper=BBC News|language=en-GB|access-date=2016-10-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.tni.org/files/download/ceta-isds-en_0.pdf|title=Trading Away Democracy, HOW CETA’S INVESTOR PROTECTION RULES THREATEN THE PUBLIC GOOD IN CANADA AND THE EU|author1=Pia Eberhardt |author2=Blair Redlin |author3=Cecile Toubeau |date=November 2014|website=tni.org|publisher=Published by Association Internationale de Techniciens, Experts et Chercheurs (Aitec), Vienna Chamber of Labour (AK Vienna), Canadian Centre for Policy Alternatives (CCPA), Corporate Europe Observatory (CEO), Council of Canadians, Canadian Union of Public Employees (CUPE), European Federation of Public Service Unions (EPSU), German NGO Forum on Environment &amp; Development, Friends of the Earth Europe (FoEE), PowerShift, Quaker Council for European Affairs (QCEA), Quebec Network on Continental Integration (RQIC), Trade Justice Network, Transnational Institute (TNI), Transport &amp; Environment (T&amp;E).|access-date=22 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.cela.ca/sites/cela.ca/files/1085-Standing%20Committee%20Submissions%20on%20CETA_Nov_30_2016.pdf|title=Submissions to the Standing Committee on International Trade Re: An Act to Implement the Comprehensive Economic and Trade Agreement (Bill C-30)|last=Blaise|first=Kerrie|date=30 Nov 2016|website=Canadian Environmental Law Association|publisher=Canadian Environmental Law Association|access-date=5 Dec 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The deal also includes a controversial [[investor-state dispute settlement]] mechanism which makes critics fear that multinational corporations could sue national governments for billions of dollars if they thought that the government policies had a bad impact on their business.&lt;ref name="auto1"/&gt; A poll conducted by [[Angus Reid Institute]] in February 2017 concluded that 55 percent of Canadians support CETA, while only 10 percent oppose it.

==History==
CETA is Canada's biggest bilateral initiative since [[NAFTA]]. It was started as a result of a joint study "Assessing the Costs and Benefits of a Closer EU-Canada Economic Partnership",&lt;ref name="link to study"/&gt; which was released in October 2008. Officials announced the launch of negotiations on 6 May 2009 at the Canada-EU Summit in [[Prague]].&lt;ref name="canada"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://eeas.europa.eu/delegations/canada/eu_canada/trade_relation/ceta/index_en.htm |website=Delegation of the EU to Canada |publisher=European External Action Service |accessdate=22 October 2014 |ref=towards-ceta |title=Towards a Comprehensive Economic and Trade Agreement |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150505112357/http://eeas.europa.eu/delegations/canada/eu_canada/trade_relation/ceta/index_en.htm |archivedate=5 May 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This, after the Canada-EU Summit in Ottawa on 18 March 2004 where leaders agreed to a framework for a new Canada-EU Trade and Investment Enhancement Agreement (TIEA). The TIEA was intended to move beyond traditional market access issues, to include areas such as trade and investment facilitation, competition, mutual recognition of professional qualifications, financial services, e-commerce, temporary entry, small- and medium-sized enterprises, [[sustainable development]], and sharing science and technology.
The TIEA was also to build on a Canada-EU regulatory co-operation framework for promoting bilateral co-operation on approaches to regulatory governance, advancing good regulatory practices and facilitating trade and investment. In addition to lowering barriers, the TIEA was meant to heighten Canadian and European interest in each other's markets.&lt;ref name="TIEA"/&gt; The TIEA continued until 2006 when Canada and the EU decided to pause negotiations. This led to negotiations on a Comprehensive Economic and Trade Agreement (CETA), and this agreement will go beyond the TIEA toward an agreement with a much broader and more ambitious scope.

An agreement in principle was signed by Canadian Prime Minister [[Stephen Harper]] and [[European Commission]] President [[José Manuel Barroso]] on 18 October 2013. The negotiations were concluded on 1 August 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sueddeutsche.de/wirtschaft/entwurf-fuer-ceta-verhandlungen-ueber-freihandelsabkommen-mit-kanada-abgeschlossen-1.2078844 |accessdate=2012-08-06 |title=Verhandlungen über Freihandelsabkommen mit Kanada abgeschlossen (Negotiations with Canada on freetrade agreement completed) |date=2012-08-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The trade agreement was officially presented on 25 September 2014 by Harper and Barroso during an EU - Canada Summit at the Royal York Hotel in downtown [[Toronto]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.embassynews.ca/news/2014/09/24/%E2%80%98symbolic%E2%80%99-leaders%E2%80%99-summit-to-mark-the-end-of-ceta-talks/46100|accessdate=2014-09-25 |title="Symbolic" summit to mark end of CETA talks |date=2014-09-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The Canada Europe Roundtable for Business has served as the parallel business process from the launch to the conclusion of the CETA negotiations.

After it had been leaked by German public television on 14 August, the 1634 pages long Consolidated CETA text was published on the EU's official website on 26 September 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://trade.ec.europa.eu/doclib/docs/2014/september/tradoc_152806.pdf |title=Consolidated CETA Text |accessdate=27 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Completion, translation of the final text into 24 EU languages, and ratification is expected to take years since the passage of the deal approval of the [[European Parliament]] and the [[European Council]] as well as Canada and the individual [[EU member states|28 EU member states]] as well.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title=CETA: Canada-EU free trade deal lauded by Harper, Barroso | author=Laura Payton | date=2013-10-18 | publisher=CBC News | url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/ceta-canada-eu-free-trade-deal-lauded-by-harper-barroso-1.2125122}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="The Star"&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.thestar.com/business/2012/04/26/canadaeurope_trade_deal_risks_derailment_over_visa_spat.html | location=Toronto | work=The Star | title=Canada-Europe deal risks derailment over visa spat}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Research commissioned by negotiating parties==
{{Update|documentation|date=February 2016}}
The EU-Canada Trade Sustainability Impact Assessment (SIA), a three-part study commissioned by the European Commission to independent experts and completed in September 2011, provides a comprehensive prediction on the impacts of CETA.&lt;ref name="SIAF"/&gt;&lt;ref name="SIAFA"/&gt;&lt;ref name="FB"/&gt; It predicts a number of macro-economic and sector-specific impacts, suggesting the EU may see increases in real GDP of 0.02–0.03% in the long-term from CETA, whereas Canada may see increases of 0.18–0.36%; the Investment section of the report suggests these numbers could be higher when factoring in investment increases. At the sectoral level, the study predicts the greatest gains in output and trade to be stimulated by services liberalization and by the removal of tariffs applied on sensitive agricultural products; it also suggests CETA could have a positive social impact if it includes provisions on the ILO's Core Labour Standards and Decent Work Agenda. The study details a variety of impacts in various "cross-cutting" components of CETA: it advocates against controversial NAFTA-style [[Investor State Dispute Settlement|ISDS]] provisions; predicts potentially imbalanced benefits from a government procurement (GP) chapter; assumes CETA will lead to an upward harmonization in [[intellectual property|IPR]] regulations, particularly changing Canadian IPR laws; and predicts impacts in terms of competition policy and several other areas.&lt;ref name=FB/&gt;

==Economic ties between the EU and Canada==
Canada and the EU have a long history of economic co-operation. Comprising 28 Member States with a total population of over 500 million and a GDP of €13.0 trillion in 2012,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Gross domestic product at market prices|url=http://epp.eurostat.ec.europa.eu/tgm/refreshTableAction.do;jsessionid=9ea7d07d30df81d7d40a2e93409b986efd20d5e17291.e34MbxeSaxaSc40LbNiMbxeNaNaNe0?tab=table&amp;plugin=1&amp;pcode=tec00001&amp;language=en|publisher=Eurostat|accessdate=19 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; the European Union (EU) is the world's largest single market, foreign investor and trader. As an integrated bloc, the EU represents Canada's second largest trading partner in goods and services. In 2008, Canadian goods and services exports to the EU totalled [[Canadian dollar|C$]]52.2 billion, an increase of 3.9% from 2007, and imports from the EU amounted to $62.4 billion.

According to [[Statistics Canada]], the EU is also the second largest source of [[foreign direct investment]] (FDI) in Canada, with the stock of FDI amounting to $133.1 billion at the end of 2008. In 2008, the stock of Canada's direct investment in the EU totalled $136.6 billion, and the EU is the destination of 21.4% of Canadian direct investment abroad. According to [[Eurostat]], the EU identified Canada as its third largest destination and its fourth largest source of FDI in 2007.

== Copyright provisions ==
{{POV|date=November 2017}}

Many of its [[Comprehensive Economic and Trade Agreement#Copyright provisions|provisions on copyright]] were initially thought to be identical to the controversial [[Anti-Counterfeiting Trade Agreement|ACTA]], which was rejected by the [[European Parliament]] in 2012. The European Commission has indicated&lt;ref&gt;http://trade.ec.europa.eu/doclib/docs/2012/august/tradoc_149866.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; that this is not the case.

Part of the Agreement is stricter enforcement of intellectual property, including [[Legal liability|liability]] for [[Internet Service Provider]]s, a ban on technologies that can be used to circumvent copyright.&lt;ref name="eff"/&gt; After failure of [[ACTA]] the copyright language in CETA was substantially watered down.&lt;ref name=AuFTA&gt;{{cite new|url=http://copyrightblog.kluweriplaw.com/2018/08/02/future-eu-australia-fta-copyright-expect-ip-chapter/|title=Future EU-Australia FTA and copyright: what could we expect in the IP chapter?|date=August 2, 2018|accessdate=7 September 2018|work=Kluwer Copyright Blog|author=Rita Matulionyte}}&lt;/ref&gt; The following provisions remain:

{{quote|
* '''WIPO ratification.''' The EU asked that Canada respect the rights and obligations under the [[WIPO]] Internet treaties. The EU only formally ratified those treaties in the week of 16 December 2009.
* '''Anti-circumvention provisions.''' The EU asked that Canada implement anti-circumvention provisions that include a ban on the distribution of circumvention devices. There is no such requirement in the WIPO Internet treaties.
* '''ISP Liability provisions.''' The treaty requires both EU and Canada to enact [[Safe harbor (law)|safe harbor]] statutory provisions that would limit ISPs liability where they act as mere conduits, cache content, or host content. These protections may not be conditioned on service provides monitoring their service for possible infringements.
* '''Enforcement provisions.''' The EU asked that Canada establish new enforcement provisions including measures to preserve evidence, ordering alleged infringers to disclose information on a wide range of issue[s], mandate disclosure of banking information in commercial infringement cases, allow for [[injunctive relief]], and destruction of goods. There is also a full section on new border measures requirements.
* '''Making available or distribution rights.''' The EU asked that Canada implement a distribution or making available right to copyright owners.

These are just the copyright provisions. There are sections dealing with patents, trademarks, designs, and (coming soon) geographical indications. These include:

* requiring Canada to comply with the [[Trademark Law Treaty]] (Canada is not a contracting party)
* requiring Canada to accede to the [[Hague Agreement Concerning the International Deposit of Industrial Designs|Hague System for the International Registration of Industrial Designs]]
* creating new legal protections for registered industrial designs including extending the term of protection from the current 10 years to up to 25 years
* requiring Canada to comply with the [[Patent Law Treaty]] (Canada has signed but not implemented)
* requiring Canada to establish enhanced protection for data submitted for pharmaceutical patents.|''Dr Michael Geist, Canada Research Chair in Internet and E-commerce Law, University of Ottawa''&lt;ref name="geist1"/&gt; }}

On 22 October 2012, five Polish NGOs criticized the secrecy surrounding the negotiations, the similarities to ACTA, and demanded more disclosures about the negotiations from the Polish government.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Wyślij |url=http://prawokultury.pl/newsy/list-5-organizacji-pozarzadowych-do-minstra-kultur/ |title=List 5 organizacji pozarządowych do Ministra Kultury i Ministra Gospodarki w sprawie umowy CETA :: Prawo kultury |language=pl |publisher=Prawokultury.pl |date= |accessdate=2012-10-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the Consolidated CETA Text a long section on "Intellectual Property Rights", IPR, (pp.&amp;nbsp;339–375) deals comprehensively with copyrights, trademarks, patents, designs, trade secrets and licensing. Here reference is made to the [[TRIPS]] agreement (p.&amp;nbsp;339 f). 
In addition to the interests of the pharmaceutical and software industries CETA encourages to prosecute "Camcording" (the so-called "film piracy", Art. 5.6, p.&amp;nbsp;343). Especially the negotiations on food exports lasted very long. The interests connected with European cheese exports and Canadian beef exports led to a protection of these kinds of intellectual properties and long lists of "Geographical Indications Identifying a Product Originating in the European Union" (pp.&amp;nbsp;363–347).&lt;ref name="Consolidated CETA Text"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.tagesschau.de/wirtschaft/ceta-dokument-101.pdf |accessdate=2014-08-15 |title=Consolidated CETA Text |work=EUROPEAN COMMISSION, Directorate-General for Trade |date=2014-08-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Non-tariff barriers ==
{{see also|Non-tariff barriers to trade}}
===Agricultural===
CETA does not alter EU non-tariff barriers such as European regulations on beef, which include a ban on the use of growth hormones. Canadian stakeholders have criticized the EU's delays in the approval process for genetically modified organisms (GMOs), and GMO traceability and labelling requirements, none of which are addressed in CETA.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Canada–European Union Economic and Trade Negotiations: The Agri-food Sector|publisher=[[Parliament of Canada]]|year=2011|accessdate=11 March 2014|url=http://www.parl.gc.ca/content/lop/researchpublications/cei-25-e.htm?Param=ce5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Both the EU and Canada will retain the right to regulate freely in areas of public interest such as environmental protection, or people's health and safety.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://ec.europa.eu/trade/policy/in-focus/ceta/#democracy|title=CETA—EU-Canada Comprehensive Economic and Trade Agreement|newspaper=Trade—European Commission|access-date=2016-10-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Impact on fisheries===

The provincial government of [[Newfoundland and Labrador]] has argued that the Federal government of Canada in Ottawa reneged on a deal to pay $280 million in exchange for its relinquishment of minimum processing requirements as part of CETA.  Those rules helped protect jobs in fish plants, especially in rural areas hit hard by the [[Collapse of the Atlantic northwest cod fishery|cod moratorium, which was instituted in 1992]].&lt;ref name=gm15&gt;[https://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/politics/newfoundland-and-labrador-says-talks-at-stalemate-with-ottawa-over-fish-fund/article24616519/ G+M: "Newfoundland and Labrador says talks at stalemate with Ottawa over fish fund"], 26 May 2015&lt;/ref&gt; The [[exclusive economic zone]] of Canada, which was the subject of the 1992 [[Canada–France Maritime Boundary Case]] dispute, will no longer be in force where fishing boats from Europe are concerned.

== Investment protection and investor-state-tribunals ==
{{See also|Investor-state dispute settlement}}

Section 4 of the CETA agreement (pages 158–161) provides Investment Protection to foreign investors, and guarantees a "fair and equitable treatment and full protection and security".

CETA allows foreign corporations to sue states before [[Investor-state dispute settlement|arbitral tribunals]] if they claim to have suffered losses because a state had violated its Non Discriminatory Treatment obligations (CETA, section 3, p 156 f) or because of a violation of the guaranteed investment protection.

This license exists only in one direction—states cannot sue companies in these investor-state arbitrations. Such investors complaints are nothing new under public international law ([[UNCTAD]] listed 514 such cases at the end of 2012, most from the United States, the Netherlands, Great Britain and Germany) but for transatlantic trade and investment, this comprehensive level of parallel justice is new.

After much criticism of the hitherto often confidential arbitral proceedings, CETA now provides for a certain amount of transparency by declaring the [[UNCITRAL]] Rules on Transparency in Treaty-based Investor-State Arbitration applicable to all proceedings (article X.33: Transparency of proceedings, p.&amp;nbsp;174).

While there is no appeal mechanism against arbitration awards comparable to scrutiny of court judgments, awards made under CETA are subject to [[International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes|ICSID]] (International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes) annulment proceedings if the claim is brought under the ICSID Rules, or setting-aside proceedings if the claim is brought under the UNCITRAL Rules or any other rules the parties have agreed on. Only after time limits set for these review mechanisms have lapsed, is the tribunal's final award to "be binding between the disputing parties and in respect of that particular case". (article X.39: Enforcement of awards, p.&amp;nbsp;177)

On 26 March 2014, German Economics Minister [[Sigmar Gabriel]] wrote an open letter to EU Trade Commissioner [[Karel De Gucht]], stating that investment protection was central sensitive  point, which could in the end decide whether a transatlantic free trade agreement would meet with German approval. He further stated that investment arbitration was unnecessary between countries with well-developed legal systems.

The CETA "[[Investor-state dispute settlement|Investor-State Dispute Settlement]]" (ISDS) provisions could create a precedent for similar arrangements within [[TTIP]]. Furthermore, critics allege that CETA would allow US companies to sue EU states through Canadian subsidiaries.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.euractiv.com/section/trade-society/news/us-multinationals-could-sue-eu-governments-through-ceta/|title=US multinationals could sue EU governments through CETA|website=EurActiv.com|language=en-GB|access-date=2016-10-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.commondreams.org/newswire/2016/09/19/canada-eu-deal-likely-result-deluge-big-business-cases-brought-against-european|title=Canada-EU Deal Likely to Result in ‘Deluge’ of Big Business Cases Brought Against European Governments|newspaper=Common Dreams|access-date=2016-10-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/voices/if-youre-worried-about-ttip-then-you-need-to-know-about-ceta-a6671886.html|title=If you're worried about TTIP, then you need to know about CETA|date=2015-09-29|newspaper=The Independent|language=en-GB|access-date=2016-10-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2016, the EU Commission announced that it had agreed with the Canadian government to replace ''ad hoc'' arbitral tribunals in CETA with a permanent dispute settlement tribunal. The tribunal will consist of 15 members named by Canada and the EU, dealing with individual cases in panels of three. An appeals mechanism will be established to ensure "legal correctness" of awards. The tribunal's members may not appear as experts or party counsel in other investment cases.&lt;ref&gt;[http://trade.ec.europa.eu/doclib/press/index.cfm?id=1468 CETA: EU and Canada agree on new approach on investment in trade agreement], EU Commission Press Release, 29 February 2016&lt;/ref&gt;

==Signature and ratification==
[[Image:Parlement wallon - CETA.jpg|thumb|250px|right|Banner opposing CETA at the [[Walloon Parliament]] in [[Namur]] on 19 October 2016.]]
It was initially unclear whether or not the EU member states had to ratify the agreement, as the European Commission considered the treaty to be solely in the competence of the EU.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.ft.com/content/8e9428d4-412a-11e6-9b66-0712b3873ae1|title=National ratification issue could derail EU-Canada trade deal|date=3 July 2016|publisher=Financial Times}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, in July 2016 it was decided that CETA be qualified as a "mixed agreement" and thus be ratified through national procedures as well.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.eppgroup.eu/press-release/The-ratification-of-CETA-by-national-parliaments|title=The ratification of CETA by national parliaments – a stepping stone in the transition from the old world of trade towards the new world of international trade|date=13 July 2016|publisher=EPP Group}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Shortly before the scheduled signature of CETA on 27 October 2016, Belgium announced it was unable to sign the treaty, as assent is required by all regional governments. The federal government and Flanders, which are governed by the centre-right [[Michel Government|Michel]] and [[Bourgeois Government|Bourgeois]] governments respectively, are in favour, whereas the [[French Community of Belgium|French Community]], [[Wallonia]] and [[Brussels]], which are led by centre-left parties that are in opposition at federal level, rejected signature in its current form. On 27 April 2016, the [[Walloon Parliament]] had already adopted a resolution in opposition to CETA. On 13 October 2016, [[David Lametti]] defended CETA before a Walloon Parliament committee.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.rtbf.be/info/belgique/detail_ceta-le-vice-ministre-canadien-defend-des-valeurs-communes-devant-le-parlement-wallon?id=9428885|title=CETA: le vice-ministre canadien défend des "valeurs communes" devant le Parlement wallon|publisher=RTBF|date=13 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the next day the Walloon Parliament affirmed its opposition. Walloon Minister-President [[Paul Magnette]] led the intra-Belgian opposition shortly before the planned signature.

The intra-Belgian disagreement was solved in the final days of October, paving the way for CETA's signature. On 28 October, the Belgian regional parliaments allowed [[Full Powers]] to be given to the federal government, and the following day Minister of Foreign Affairs [[Didier Reynders]] gave his signature on behalf of Belgium.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://deredactie.be/permalink/1.2805902|title=Reynders heeft handtekening gezet onder Belgisch akkoord voor CETA|date=29 October 2016|publisher=deredactie.be}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://nautilus.parlement-wallon.be/Archives/2016_2017/MOTION/633_3.pdf MOTION déposée en conclusion du débat sur l’Accord économique et commercial global (AECG–CETA)].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="13909">'''Dynamic enterprise modeling''' (DEM) is an [[enterprise modeling]] approach developed by the [[Baan Corporation|Baan]] company, and used for the Baan [[enterprise resource planning]] system which aims "to align and implement it in the organizational architecture of the end-using company".&lt;ref&gt;Hossein Bidgoli (2003). ''Encyclopedia of Information Systems''. page 177.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Heinz-Dieter Knoll et al. (2003). ''Optimising Business Performance with Standard Software Systems''. p. 95.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Koning (2008), Baan introduced dynamic enterprise modelling in 1996 as a "means for implementing the Baan ERP product. The modelling focused on a [[Petri net]]–based technique for [[business process modelling]] to which the Baan application units were to be linked. DEM also contains a [[supply-chain]] diagram tool for the logistic network of the company and of an enterprise [[function model]]ling diagram".&lt;ref&gt;Hendrik Koning (2008). [http://igitur-archive.library.uu.nl/dissertations/2008-0908-200828/koning.pdf Communication of IT-Architecture]. Thesis Dutch Research School for Information and Knowledge Systems. {{ISBN|978-90-5335-163-5}}. p.94.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Overview ==
To align a specific company with dynamic enterprise modeling, the organizational structure is blueprinted top-down from high-level [[business process]]es to low-level processes. This blueprint is used as a roadmap of the organization, that is compatible with the structural roadmap of the software package. Having both roadmaps, the software package and the organizational structure are alienable. The blueprint of an [[organizational structure]] in dynamic enterprise modeling is called a [[reference model]]. A reference model is the total view of visions, functions, organizational structures and processes, which together can be defined as a representative way of doing business in a certain [[organizational typology]].

The DEM reference model consists of a set of underlying models that depict the organizational architecture in a top-down direction. The underlying models are:

* ''Enterprise structure diagrams'': The company site structure is visualized with the dispersed geographic locations, the headquarters, manufacturing plants, warehouses, and supplier and customer locations. Physical as well as logical multi-site organizations for internal logistic or financial flow optimization can be diagrammed.&lt;ref&gt;[[Sjaak Brinkkemper]] (2001). [http://www.caise01.ethz.ch/tutorials/brinkkemper.html Business Modelling for the Development and Implementation of Enterprise Applications] (Abstract). Accessed Aug 1, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''Business control model'' : The business control model represents the primary processes of the organization and their control, grouped in business functions. The DEM reference model exists of one main Business Control Model, resulting in several other Business Control Models per function area of the organization.
* ''Business function model'' : The business function model is a [[function model]] that focuses on the targets of the several functions within the company.
* ''Business process model'' : The business process model focuses on the execution of the functions and processes that originate from the business control model and the business function model. Processes flows are depicted and processes are detailed out.
* ''Business organization model'' : The business organization model focuses less on the processes and more on the organizational aspects such as roles and responsibilities.

Together these models are capable of depicting the total organizational structure and aspects that are necessary during the implementation of the dynamic enterprise modeling. The models can have differentiations, which are based on the typology of the organization (i.e.: engineer-to-order organizations require different model structures than assemble-to-order organizations. To elaborate on the way that the reference model is used to implement software and to keep track of the scope of implementation methods, the business control model and the business process model will be explained in detail.

== Dynamic enterprise modeling topics ==

=== Business control model ===
The business control model exists of the business functions of the organization and their internal and external links. Basic features in the model are:

* ''Request-feedback-loop'': A link from, to, or between business functions is called a request-feedback-loop, which consists of 4 states that complete the process and information flows between both business functions. The states are labeled: requested, committed, completed and accepted.
* ''Workflow case''. A workflow case is the description of the execution and the target of the process that occurs between two business functions. The most important critical factors of the workflow case are quantity, quality and time. The 4 states of Request-feedback-loop the together represent the workflow case.
* ''Triggers'': Business functions are aggregates of business processes and focus mainly on the triggers (control) between processes, thus not on the information flows.
* ''Business functions'' : In an optimal situation for the modeling process, a company has only one business function. Business functions are however subdivided when:
** The nature and characteristics of workflow cases fluctuate
** The frequency in underlying processes fluctuate
** Detail-level fluctuates
** More than 1 type of request triggers a function

Next to interaction between two business functions, interaction can also exist between objects that are not in the scope of the reference model. These objects can be external business functions and agents.

* ''External business function'' : this is a group of processes that are part of the organization (meaning that the organization can control the functions), but that is outside of the scope of the reference model.
Agents on the other hand are entities similar to business functions with the exception that they are external of the business (i.e.: customers and suppliers).
* Processes within or between business functions are executed by '''triggers''', which can be '''event-driven''' or '''time-driven'''.
* Exceptions in a system are handled, according to the set handling level in the business process configuration, when the success path of the model is not met in practice.
Subroutines of processes can be modeled in the Business Control Model to take care of possible exceptions that can occur during the execution of a process (i.e.: delay handling in the delivery of goods).

In addition to business functions that consist of the main processes of the organization,  management functions exist.
* ''Management business functions'': These are functions that manage the business process itself and that thus support the execution and triggering of the main business functions.

Having this reference, the main processes of the organization can be captured in the Business Control Model. The main functions of the organization are grouped in the business functions, which consist of the processes that are part of the specific business function. Interactions between the business functions are then depicted using the request-feedback loops.

=== Constructing the business control model ===
A business control model is constructed according to a set path.
* First, the '''scope''' of the business is defined. The scope includes scoping what to model and includes the definition of the agents and external business functions that relate to the business.
* Next, the scope is depicted to a model of the black box with al the agents and external business functions surrounding the black box.
* The next step is to define the process and information flows (request-feedback flows) between the agents and external business functions to and from the black box of the business control model. Defining the request-feedback flows enables the modeler to define what processes are inside the black box.

After creating the main business functions within the business control model, the several business functions are detailed out.
* In case of a production business it is vital to define the '''customer order decoupling point''', referring to the split in the physical process where processes are based on the customer order instead of forecasts.
* Service based businesses on the other hand do not have a physical goods flow and thus do not require a physical process model. It is however imaginable that the same type of process flow can be utilized to construct a business control model for a service based business, as a service can be interpreted as a product as well. In this way, a business control model can be constructed similarly for a service based business as for a physical goods production business, having intangible goods instead of tangible.
* Next to the low-level physical production process, the high-level business functions need to be defined as well. In most cases the higher level business functions relate to planning functions and other tactical and strategical business functions, followed by functions as sales and purchase.

After high-level detail definitions, the business functions are decomposed to lower-level detail definitions to make the business control model alienable to the lower models within the reference model, for this practice, mainly the Business Process Model. In the Business Process Model the processes are elaborated until the lowest level of detail. Given this level of detail, the Baan software functionality is then projected on the processes, depicted in the Business Process Model.

=== Business process model ===
The modeling of processes in DEM, modeling the business process model is done using ''[[Petri net]] building blocks''. DEM uses 4 construction elements:

* State : A state element represents the state of a job token and is followed by the activity that executes the job token of the state.
* Processing activity : A processing activity is the activity that processes the job token of a state, transforming the state of the job token to another state.
* Control activity: A control activity navigates the process activity but does not execute it.
* Subprocess : A subprocess is a collection of different other processes, aggregated in a single element by means of [[complexity management]].

These 4 construction elements enables the modeling of DEM models. The modeling is due to a set collection of modeling constraints, guiding the modeling process in order to have similarly created models by different modelers. Control activities exist in different structures in order to set different possible routes for process flows. The used structures for control activities are:

* OR-split / XOR-split : This structure creates 2 new states out of 1 state, signaling the creation of 2 job tokens out of 1 job token. If the new state can be both of the output tokens, the split is OR, if not, the split is an exclusive OR split (XOR).
* AND-join construction : 2 job tokens are both needed to enable the control activity, creating 1 new job token (thus 1 new state).
* OR-join / XOR-join : 2 job tokens are needed to enable the control activity, creating 1 new job token.
OR means one of the two starting job tokens can be used or both, XOR means only one of the tokens can be used to create the output job token.

=== An example ===
The example below demonstrates the modeling of the concept of marriage and divorce using Petri net building blocks. &lt;!-- Unsourced image removed: [[Image:DEM-Marriage.gif|300px]] --&gt;
* The Petri net built model expresses the transformation from a single man and woman to a married couple through marriage and back to single individuals through divorce.
* The model starts with the two states called man and woman.
* Through an AND-join construction (both man and woman are needed in order to form a couple) the two states are joined within the control activity called coupling to the new state called couple.
* The couple state then is transformed through the processing activity called marriage, resulting in the transformed state of married couple.
* The state married couple is then transformed to the state divorced couple using the process activity called divorce, resulting in the state called divorced couple.
* The control activity called decoupling finally splits the divorced couple state into the states of man and woman.

=== Assessments ===
Using an embedded method brings the power that the method is designed to implement the software product that the method comes with. This suggests a less complicated usage of the method and more support possibilities.
The negative aspect of an embedded method obviously is that it can only be used for specific product software. Engineers and consultants, operating with several software products, could have more use of a general method, to have just one way of working.

=== Management control systems ===
Lowe was one of the first authors to define [[management control system]]s. In his 1972 article "On the idea of a management control system" he listed the following four reasons for the need for a planning and control system:
:''The need for a planning and control system within a business organization flows from certain general characteristics of the nature of business enterprises, the chief of which are follows:''
:* ''firstly, the enterprise has (by definition) organizational objectives, as distinct from the separable and individual ones of the members constituting the 'managerial coalition';'' 
:* ''Secondly, the managers of the sub-units of the enterprise must necessarily be ambivalent in view of their own personal goals, as well as have a good deal of discretion in deciding how they should behave and in formulating their part of any overall plan to achieve organizational objectives; ''
:* ''thirdly, business situations (and people's behaviour) are full of uncertainty, internally as well as externally to the business enterprise.'' 
:* ''fourthly, there is a necessity to economize, in human endeavours we are invariably concerned with an allocation of effort and resources so as to achieve a given set of objectives...''&lt;ref&gt;[[Lowe, Ernest A.]] "On the idea of a management control system: integrating accounting and management control." Journal of management Studies 8.1 (1971): 1-12.&lt;/ref&gt;

The term ‘[[management control]]’ was given of its current connotations by [[Robert N. Anthony]] (Otley, 1994).&lt;ref&gt;Otley, D., 1994. Management control in contemporary organizations: towards a wider framework, Management Accounting Research, 5, 289-299.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Reception ===
David Cooper (2014) recounted
:''Tony Lowe's publications are important contributions to the intellectual beginnings of critical accounting and a fitting memorial to his recent death. This... [started with] Tony's conceptualization of management control as a system...''&lt;ref&gt;Cooper, David J. "On the intellectual roots of critical accounting: A personal appreciation of Tony Lowe (1928–2014)." ''Critical Perspectives on Accounting'' Vol. 25, Iss. 4–5, July 2014, Pages 287–292 (2014).&lt;/ref&gt;

Rob Gray (2014) added: 
:''[Lowe was] possibly the most important academic the field of accounting has ever produced... He was absolutely crucial in the development of wider perspectives on accounting drawing equally from economic, sociology, decision theory, systems science and operations research to set in motion the accounting we know these days as interpretative and critical. His influence on modern management accounting is incalculable. More generally, I have always been in awe of his creation of the ‘Sheffield School’ and his critical influence on its principal members such as Wai Fong Chua, David Cooper, Richard Laughlin, Tony Puxty, Tony Tinker, [[Prem Sikka]], Dick Wilson...''&lt;ref name="RG 2014"/&gt;

'''GM-AvtoVAZ''' is a joint venture in Russia between [[General Motors]] and [[AvtoVAZ]] set up in 2001 and began producing the [[Chevrolet Niva]], based on the Lada Niva, at its factory in [[Tolyatti]] from 2002. Though both companies have an equal share of ownership, the venture is managed exclusively by General Motors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=«Когда-то Lada по сравнению с Dacia считалась люксовым брендом»|url=https://www.vedomosti.ru/auto/characters/2016/06/14/645207-kompaniyu-pribilnosti|accessdate=7 July 2017|publisher=Vedomosti|date=13 June 2016|quote=– В этом СП «АвтоВАЗа» и GM по 50%, но фактически управляет им GM? – Да.Мы являемся для них важным поставщиком и обсуждаем условия по новой платформе.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
[[File:Chevrolet Niva Concept.JPG|thumb|left|[[Chevrolet Niva]]]]
In 2004 the joint venture briefly produced the [[Chevrolet Viva]], based on the 1998 [[Opel Astra]] saloon, but after low sales of only 5,000 the model was dropped.&lt;ref name=Bloomberg&gt;{{cite web|title=GM: Learning the Ropes In Russia|url=http://www.businessweek.com/stories/2007-02-08/gm-learning-the-ropes-in-russiabusinessweek-business-news-stock-market-and-financial-advice|work=Bloomberg Business Week|accessdate=18 December 2012|date=8 February 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The joint venture reached difficulties and production stoppages for a fortnight in February 2006 when AvtoVAZ was taken over by [[Rosoboronexport]], the Russian state-owned arms-export agency, and a disagreement between the new owners and GM lead to stoppages of the supply of engines and other components.&lt;ref name=Bloomberg/&gt;

The joint venture announced plans in September 2012 to expand by 2015, with an additional 1400 staff and increasing its annual production capacity from 100,000 to 120,000 vehicles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=GM-AvtoVaz To Expand Capacity By 20% By 2015|url=https://www.wsj.com/article/BT-CO-20120921-702821.html|work=Wall Street Journal|accessdate=18 December 2012|date=21 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ownership==
[[File:Russia Re-Industrializes as Energy Boom Fades.theora.ogv|thumbnail|[[Voice of America]] report, showing operations inside the plant and an interview with a representative from GM Russia.]]
The joint venture was created with investment from GM ($99.1m, 41.61%), AvtoVAZ ($99.1m, 41.61%) and the [[European Bank for Reconstruction and Development]] ($40m, 16,78%, plus a loan facility for $100 million).

'''Hamra Street''' or '''Rue Hamra''' ({{lang-ar|شارع الحمراء}}) is one of the main streets of the city of [[Beirut]], Lebanon, and one of the main economic and diplomatic hubs of Beirut. It is located in the neighborhood of the same name, [[Hamra, Beirut|Hamra]]. Its technical name is Rue 31. Due to the numerous sidewalk cafes and theatres, Hamra Street was the centre of intellectual activity in Beirut during the 1960s and 1970s.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hamrablues.com/archive/sidebars/june_30_05_hamra.html ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080122131924/http://www.hamrablues.com/archive/sidebars/june_30_05_hamra.html |date=January 22, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Before 1975, Hamra Street and the surrounding district was known as Beirut's trendiest, though in the post-war period it has arguably been eclipsed by [[Rue Monot]] in [[Ashrafieh]], [[Rue Gouraud]] in [[Gemmayzeh]], [[Rue Verdun]], and [[Beirut Central District|downtown area]].&lt;ref&gt;[//www.nytimes.com/interactive/2016/02/19/travel/where-to-go-in-beirut.html New York Times]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ikamalebanon.com/accommodations/region/beirut_acc/district/hamra.htm |title=Hamra |publisher=Ikamalebanon.com |date= |accessdate=2012-02-11 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120211075334/http://www.ikamalebanon.com/accommodations/region/beirut_acc/district/hamra.htm |archivedate=2012-02-11 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  In the mid 1990s, the Municipality of Beirut gave a face lift to the street to reattract tourists all year round. Hamra Street was known as '''Beirut's Champs Elysées''' as it was frequented by tourists, mostly Americans, Europeans and mega-rich Arabs, all year round.

Today it is a commercial district with numerous prestigious universities (such as: [[American University of Beirut]], [[Lebanese American University]], and [[Haigazian University]]), hotels, furnished apartments, libraries, restaurants and coffee shops, with "78 Street" (commonly known as "the Alleyway") being Hamra's main [[pubbing]] and [[clubbing (subculture)|clubbing]] hub.

== Geography ==
Hamra Street runs east-west, connecting [[Beirut Central District]] with the [[Ras Beirut]] neighborhoods. The street begins at the intersection of Rue de Rome and runs west until the intersection of Rue Sadat.  Hamra Street is also a walking distance from the [[American University of Beirut]] on [[Bliss Street]], [[Haigazian University]] on Rue Michel Chiha and the campus of the [[Lebanese American University]] as well as [[Rue Jeanne d'Arc]] and [[René Moawad Garden]] on [[Rue Spears]].

==Demographics==
The [[Los Angeles Times]] journalist and [[Pulitzer Prize]] winner [[Borzou Daragahi]] described the street as a bastion of liberalism [that] embraces multiple religions and political views; Hamra Street is an amalgam of all of Lebanon's religious groups, including [[Sunni Islam in Lebanon|Sunnis]], [[Maronite Christianity in Lebanon|Maronites]], [[Melkite Christianity in Lebanon|Melkites]], [[Greek Orthodox Christianity in Lebanon|Greek Orthodox Christians]], [[Druze]], and [[Shia Islam in Lebanon|Shias]]. Hamra, however, remains [[Lebanon]]'s [[Secularity|secular]] haven, melting pot for free thinkers and the least religiously affiliated area around [[Beirut]] as the area hosts a limited number of churches and mosques.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/babylonbeyond/2008/05/lebanon-if-hamr.html |title=LEBANON: If Hamra Street Could Talk|publisher=Los Angeles Times|date=20 May 2008|accessdate=2012-02-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Economy==
It hosts a large number of western chains (including Gloria Jean's, [[Caribou Coffee]], [[Costa Coffee]] and [[Starbucks]]), as well as many local shops and restaurants. The appropriately named Cafe Hamra is a restaurant celebrating the historic street with  an old street graffiti decor and a variety of international and Lebanese food as well as hookah smoking. Cafe Younes is another popular cafe that was first opened in 1935 and is run by a small family and is run by Amin Younes, the grandson of the founder of the same name. It is also known for its tourist appeal and variety of hotels. Its main landmark is the [[Crowne Plaza Hotel (Lebanon)|Crowne Plaza]]. The street buzzes with life during the summer when many tourists, especially from the Persian Gulf area, flock to Lebanon.

Before the [[Lebanese civil war]], Hamra Street was known as Beirut's "Champs Elysées" as it was frequented by tourists all year round. [[Beirut's Piccadilly Theatre]] was one of the major theaters in the [[Middle East]]. Hamra Street is a first-rate commercial district which proudly displays the latest fads in fashion. It also hosts a good number of hotels, furnished apartments and coffee shops that cater to visitors and students from the nearby American University of Beirut, Lebanese American University and Haigazian University.

Hamra no longer functions as the cosmopolitan bastion of sectarian Lebanon. The Lebanese civil war and the ensuing government regulation that enforced rent control on all of the buildings removed the neighborhood's elite, pre-war cachet. However, the neighborhood remains trendy and profitable because of:
#the historical significance of the neighborhood;
#the attraction of "authentic" Beirut to foreign tourists, particularly those from the Persian Gulf;
#the historic Hamra red light / supernightclub district, and the present acceptability of opening pubs, bars, and public cafes that serve alcohol in the district;
#the current locations of the Lebanese Central Bank (Banque Du Liban), many private banks, multiple major newspapers (As-Safir, the wartime and pre-war headquarters of An-Nahar, and the near neighbors Al-Akhbar and Al-Mustaqbal), and many Lebanese government ministries (including the Ministries of Interior, Information, Tourism, and Economy and Trade), which have existed in Hamra since before the civil war;
#the close proximity and economic focal points of four of Lebanon's most significant universities: the American University of Beirut, the Lebanese American University, and Haigazian University.
#the booming commercial scene in Hamra St. that is a combination of retail shops, cafes, and restaurants.

Although it has yet to revive fully its pre-war legacy, Hamra Street has undergone many renovations and is still regarded by many as the heart of the city. While it is no longer the nightlife and commercial center of Beirut, it has become one of many pocket areas and streets scattered throughout the city, and is included with other streets and areas as [[Rue Monot]], [[Rue Gouraud]], and [[Rue Verdun]].

==Hamra Street Festival==
Hamra Streets Festival is launched in the autumn of each year under the patronage of the Prime Minister. It is a convivial and cultural festival, its aim is to exhibit the cultural and artistic diversity of Lebanon in general and Hamra Street in particular.
The festival has encompassed a vast number of activities and events that target all age groups.

*First act against the Israeli occupation in 1982 at the Wimpy Cafe.
*[[Christopher Hitchens]] described Hamra street by saying: "As Arab thoroughfares go, Hamra Street in the center of Beirut is probably the most chic of them all. International in flavor, cosmopolitan in character, it boasts the sort of smart little café where a Lebanese sophisticate can pause between water-skiing in the Mediterranean in the morning and snow-skiing in the mountains just above the city in the afternoon. “The Paris of the Middle East” used to be the cliché about Beirut: by that exacting standard, I suppose, Hamra Street would be the Boulevard Saint-Germain."&lt;ref&gt;https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2009/05/christopher-hitchens200905&lt;/ref&gt;

==Acquisition of shares of TSV 1860 Munich==
In June 2011, Ismaik bought 60 percent, an investment of €18 million ($25.8 million) of [[TSV 1860 Munich]], a German sports club based in [[Munich]] that plays in the 4. Liga. Becoming the first [[Arab]] to acquire shares of a German [[football]] club, Ismaik claimed that his aim was to safeguard the survival of the club that was one of the founding members of the German national Bundesliga.&lt;ref name="hamgmunich"&gt;[http://www.arabianbusiness.com/mideast-money-saves-germany-s-tsv-1860-munchen-404833.html#.VxNcuvl95D- Mideast money saves Germany's TSV 1860 Munchen]. Arabian Business (12 June 2011). Retrieved on 17 April 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; Due to DFL regulations, Ismaik only has 49 percent of the voting rights; the additional shares are without voting rights.

Ismaik commented on the acquisition:

{{Quote|text=TSV 1860 has a great tradition and identity that ought to be preserved and supported. The club has enormous potential and a truly great and passionate fan base. I will do everything to bring TSV 1860 back into the profit zone.”''|source=[[Arabian Business]]&lt;ref name="hamgmunich" /&gt;}}

The acquisition was followed by a long and controversial discussion about Ismaik's goals and intentions regarding this investment, which is still ongoing (Status as of December 2016).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.n-tv.de/sport/fussball/Loewen-Investor-holt-zum-Rundumschlag-aus-article19182611.html|title=Beispiellose Attacke gegen 1860: Löwen-Investor holt zum Rundumschlag aus|last=Nachrichtenfernsehen|first=n-tv|newspaper=n-tv.de|access-date=2016-12-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since the acquisition of the shares, neither the financial situation nor the sporting success of TSV 1860 Munich have improved significantly.

At the end of the 2016-17 season, TSV 1860 Munich were relegated to the third tier of German football following a play-off defeat against Jahn Regensburg. Unable to resolve his differences with club officials regarding his control of the club, Ismaik refused to provide the approximately ten million euros necessary for a 3.Liga playing license and the club was subsequently automatically relegated even further to the regional fourth tier. Ismaik remains in control.{{cn|date=August 2018}}

'''International Financial Reporting Standards''', usually called '''IFRS''',&lt;ref name="ifrs.org_About"&gt;{{Citation |author=IFRS Foundation |title=Who we are and what we do: The IFRS Foundation and the International Accounting Standards Board |url=http://www.ifrs.org/About-us/Documents/Who-We-Are-English.pdf |accessdate=18 May 2017 |postscript=.}}&lt;/ref&gt; are [[standardization|standards]] issued by the [[IFRS Foundation]] and the [[International Accounting Standards Board]] (IASB) to provide a common global language for business affairs so that company [[accounting|accounts]] are understandable and comparable across international boundaries. They are a consequence of growing international shareholding and trade and are particularly important for companies that have dealings in several countries. They are progressively replacing the many different national accounting standards. They are the rules to be followed by accountants to maintain books of accounts which are comparable, understandable, reliable and relevant as per the users internal or external. IFRS, with the exception of ''IAS 29 Financial Reporting in Hyperinflationary Economies'' and ''IFRIC 7 Applying the Restatement Approach under IAS 29'', are authorized in terms of the historical cost paradigm. IAS 29 and IFRIC 7 are authorized in terms of the units of constant purchasing power paradigm.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ifrs.org/Meetings/MeetingDocs/Interpretations%20Committee/2014/January/AP10-IAS%2029%20Applicability%20of%20inancial%20capital%20maintenance%20concept%20in%20CPPU.pdf IFRS Interpretation Committee Meeting: IAS 29 Financial Reporting in Hyperinflationary Economies: Applicability of the concept of financial capital maintenance defined in constant purchasing power units. 1 (a)]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ifrs.org/IFRSs/Pages/IFRS.aspx Conceptual Framework (2010) Par. 4.59 (a) "Financial capital maintenance can be measured in either nominal monetary units or [[units of constant purchasing power]]."]&lt;/ref&gt;
IAS 2 is related to inventories in this standard we talk about the stock its production process etc
IFRS began as an attempt to harmonize accounting across the European Union but the value of harmonization quickly made the concept attractive around the world. However, it has been debated whether or not de facto harmonization has occurred. Standards that were issued by IASC (the predecessor of IASB) are still within use today and go by the name '''International Accounting Standards''' (IAS), while standards issued by IASB are called IFRS. IAS were issued between 1973 and 2001 by the Board of the [[International Accounting Standards Committee]] (IASC). On 1 April 2001, the new [[International Accounting Standards Board]] (IASB) took over from the IASC the responsibility for setting International Accounting Standards. During its first meeting the new Board adopted existing IAS and Standing Interpretations Committee standards (SICs). The IASB has continued to develop standards calling the new standards "International Financial Reporting Standards".

Criticisms of IFRS are (1) that they are not being adopted in the US (see [[Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (United States)|US GAAP]]), (2) a number of criticisms from France and (3) that ''IAS 29 Financial Reporting in Hyperinflationary Economies'' had no positive effect at all during 6 years in Zimbabwe's hyperinflationary economy. The IASB offered responses to the first two criticisms, but has offered no response to the last criticism while IAS 29 was as of March 2014 being implemented in its original form in Venezuela and Belarus.

Financial statements are a structured representation of the financial positions and financial performance of an entity. The objective of financial statements is to provide information about the financial position, financial performance and cash flows of an entity that is useful to a wide range of users in making economic decisions. Financial statements also show the results of the management's stewardship of the resources entrusted to it.&lt;ref name="Paragraph 9 of the standard IAS 1"&gt;[http://eifrs.ifrs.org/eifrs/bnstandards/en/2013/ias1.pdf Paragraph 9 of the standard IAS 1]&lt;/ref&gt;

A To meet this objective, financial statements provide information about an entity's assets and cash flows. This information, along with other information in the notes, assists users of financial statements in predicting the entity's future cash flows and, in particular, their timing and certainty.&lt;ref name="Paragraph 9 of the standard IAS 1"/&gt;

The following are the general features in IFRS:
* Fair presentation and compliance with IFRS: Fair presentation requires the faithful representation of the effects of the transactions, other events and conditions in accordance with the definitions and recognition criteria for assets, liabilities, income and expenses set out in the Framework of IFRS.&lt;ref&gt;[http://eifrs.ifrs.org/eifrs/bnstandards/en/2013/ias1.pdf Paragraph 15 of the standard IAS 1]&lt;/ref&gt; 
* Going concern: Financial statements are present on a going concern basis unless management either intends to liquidate the entity or to cease trading, or has no realistic alternative but to do so.&lt;ref&gt;[http://eifrs.ifrs.org/eifrs/bnstandards/en/2013/ias1.pdf Paragraph 25 of the standard IAS 1]&lt;/ref&gt; 
* Accrual basis of accounting: An entity shall recognise items as assets, liabilities, equity, income and expenses when they satisfy the definition and recognition criteria for those elements in the Framework of IFRS.&lt;ref&gt;[http://eifrs.ifrs.org/eifrs/bnstandards/en/2013/ias1.pdf Paragraph 28 of the standard IAS 1]&lt;/ref&gt; 
* Materiality and aggregation: Every material class of similar items has to be presented separately. Items that are of a dissimilar nature or function shall be presented separately unless they are immaterial.&lt;ref&gt;[http://eifrs.ifrs.org/eifrs/bnstandards/en/2013/ias1.pdf Paragraph 29 of the standard IAS 1]&lt;/ref&gt;
* Offsetting: Offsetting is generally forbidden in IFRS.&lt;ref&gt;[http://eifrs.ifrs.org/eifrs/bnstandards/en/2013/ias1.pdf Paragraph 32 of the standard IAS 1]&lt;/ref&gt;  However certain standards require offsetting when specific conditions are satisfied (such as in case of the accounting for defined benefit liabilities in IAS 19&lt;ref&gt;[http://eifrs.ifrs.org/eifrs/bnstandards/en/2013/ias19.pdf Paragraph 57, 63 of the standard IAS 19]&lt;/ref&gt;  and the net presentation of deferred tax liabilities and deferred tax assets in IAS 12&lt;ref&gt;[http://eifrs.ifrs.org/eifrs/bnstandards/en/2013/ias12.pdf Paragraph 71 of the standard IAS 12]&lt;/ref&gt;). 
* Frequency of reporting: IFRS requires that at least annually a complete set of financial statements is presented.&lt;ref&gt;[http://eifrs.ifrs.org/eifrs/bnstandards/en/2013/ias1.pdf Paragraph 36 of the standard IAS 1]&lt;/ref&gt;  However listed companies generally also publish interim financial statements (for which the accounting is fully IFRS compliant)for which the presentation is in accordance with IAS 34 ''Interim Financing Reporting''.  
* Comparative information: IFRS requires entities to present comparative information in respect of the preceding period for all amounts reported in the current period's financial statements. In addition comparative information shall also be provided for narrative and descriptive information if it is relevant to understanding the current period's financial statements.&lt;ref&gt;[http://eifrs.ifrs.org/eifrs/bnstandards/en/2013/ias1.pdf Paragraph 38 of the standard IAS 1]&lt;/ref&gt;  The standard IAS 1 also requires an additional statement of financial position (also called a third balance sheet) when an entity applies an accounting policy retrospectively or makes a retrospective restatement of items in its financial statements, or when it reclassifies items in its financial statements. This for example occurred with the adoption of the revised standard IAS 19 (as of 1 January 2013) or when the new consolidation standards IFRS 10-11-12 were adopted (as of 1 January 2013 or 2014 for companies in the European Union).&lt;ref&gt;[http://eifrs.ifrs.org/eifrs/bnstandards/en/2013/ias1.pdf Paragraph 10f of the standard IAS 1]&lt;/ref&gt;
* Consistency of presentation: IFRS requires that the presentation and classification of items in the financial statements is retained from one period to the next unless: {{Ordered list|list-style-type=lower-alpha and

| it is apparent, following a significant change in the nature of the entity's operations or a review of its financial statements, that another presentation or classification would be more appropriate having regard to the criteria for the selection and application of accounting policies in IAS 8; or
| an IFRS standard requires a change.}}

==Qualitative characteristics of financial information ==

Fundamental qualitative characteristics of financial information include:
* Relevance 
* Faithful representation

Enhancing qualitative characteristics include:
* Comparability
* Verifiability
* Timeliness
* Understandability

==Elements of financial statements==

The elements directly related to the measurement of the '''[[statement of financial position]]''' include:
* '''[[Asset]]''': An asset is a resource controlled by the entity as a result of past events  and from which future economic benefits are expected to flow to the entity.
* '''[[Liability (financial accounting)|Liability]]''': A liability is a present obligation of the entity arising from the past events, the settlement of which is expected to result in an outflow from the entity of resources embodying economic benefits, i.e. assets.
* '''[[Equity (finance)|Equity]]''': Nominal equity is the nominal residual interest in the nominal assets of the entity after deducting all its liabilities in nominal value.&lt;ref&gt;[http://eifrs.ifrs.org/eifrs/bnstandards/en/2013/conceptualframework.pdf Paragraph 4.4 of the Framework of IFRS]&lt;/ref&gt;

The financial performance of an entity is presented in the '''[[statement of comprehensive income]]''', which consists of the income statement (Statement of Profit/Loss) and the statement of other comprehensive income&lt;ref&gt;[http://eifrs.ifrs.org/eifrs/bnstandards/en/2013/ias1.pdf Paragraph 10A of the standard IAS 1]&lt;/ref&gt; (usually presented in two separate statements). Financial performance includes the following elements (which are recognised in the income statement or other comprehensive income as required by the applicable IFRS standard):
* '''[[Revenue]]s''': increases in economic benefit during an accounting period in the form of inflows or enhancements of assets, or decrease of liabilities that result in increases in equity. However, it does not include the contributions made by the equity participants (for example owners, partners or shareholders).
* '''[[Expense]]s''': decreases in economic benefits during an accounting period in the form of outflows, or depletions of assets or incurrences of liabilities that result in decreases in equity. However, these don't include the distributions made to the equity participants.&lt;ref&gt;[http://eifrs.ifrs.org/eifrs/bnstandards/en/2013/conceptualframework.pdf Paragraph 4.25 of the Framework of IFRS]&lt;/ref&gt;

Results recognised in other comprehensive income are limited to the following specific circumstances: 
* Remeasurements of defined benefit assets or liabilities (as defined in the standard IAS 19)&lt;ref&gt;[http://eifrs.ifrs.org/eifrs/bnstandards/en/2013/ias19.pdf Paragraph 120 of the standard IAS 19]&lt;/ref&gt;
* Increases or decreases in the fair value of financial assets classified as available for sale (with the exception of impairment losses)(as defined in the standard IAS 39)&lt;ref&gt;[http://eifrs.ifrs.org/eifrs/bnstandards/en/2013/ias39.pdf Paragraph 55b of the standard IAS 39]&lt;/ref&gt;
* Increases or decreases resulting from the application of a revaluation of property, plant and equipment&lt;ref&gt;[http://eifrs.ifrs.org/eifrs/bnstandards/en/2013/ias16.pdf Paragraph 39 of the standard IAS 16]&lt;/ref&gt; or [[intangible asset]]s&lt;ref&gt;[http://eifrs.ifrs.org/eifrs/bnstandards/en/2013/ias38.pdf Paragraph 85 of the standard IAS 38]&lt;/ref&gt;
* Exchange differences resulting from the translation of foreign operations (subsidiary, associate, joint arrangement or branch of a reporting entity, the activities of which are conducted in a country or currency other than those of the reporting entity&lt;ref&gt;[http://eifrs.ifrs.org/eifrs/bnstandards/en/2013/ias21.pdf Paragraph 8 of the standard IAS 21]&lt;/ref&gt;) according to the standard IAS 21&lt;ref&gt;[http://eifrs.ifrs.org/eifrs/bnstandards/en/2013/ias21.pdf Paragraph 39 of the standard IAS 21]&lt;/ref&gt;
* the portion of the gain or loss on the hedging instrument in a [[cash flow hedge]] (or a hedge of a net investment in a foreign operation, as this is accounted similarly&lt;ref&gt;[http://eifrs.ifrs.org/eifrs/bnstandards/en/2013/ias39.pdf Paragraph 102 of the standard IAS 39]&lt;/ref&gt;) that is determined to be an effective hedge&lt;ref&gt;[http://eifrs.ifrs.org/eifrs/bnstandards/en/2013/ias39.pdf Paragraph 95 of the standard IAS 39]&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''[[statement of changes in equity]]''' consists of a reconciliation of the changes in equity in which the following information is provided: 
* total comprehensive income for the period, showing separately the total amounts attributable to owners of the parent and to non-controlling interests;
* for each component of equity, the effects of retrospective application or retrospective restatement recognised in accordance with IAS 8; and
* for each component of equity, a reconciliation between the carrying amount at the beginning and the end of the period, separately disclosing changes resulting from:
** profit or loss;
** other comprehensive income; and
** transactions with owners in their capacity as owners, showing separately contributions by and distributions to owners and changes in ownership interests in subsidiaries that do not result in a loss of control.&lt;ref&gt;[http://eifrs.ifrs.org/eifrs/bnstandards/en/2013/ias1.pdf Paragraph 106 of the standard IAS 1]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''[[Cash flow statement]]'''
* '''[[Operating cash flows]]''': the principal revenue-producing activities of the entity and are generally calculated by applying the indirect method, whereby profit or loss is adjusted for the effects of transaction of a non-cash nature, any deferrals or accruals of past or future cash receipts or payments, and items of income or expense associated with investing or financing cash flows.&lt;ref name="eifrs.ifrs.org"&gt;http://eifrs.ifrs.org/eifrs/bnstandards/en/2013/ias7.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''[[Investing cash flows]]''': the acquisition and disposal of long-term assets and other investments not included in cash equivalents. These represent the extent to which expenditures have been made for resources intended to generate future income and cash flows. Only expenditures that result in a recognised asset in the statement of financial position are eligible for classification as investing activities.&lt;ref name="eifrs.ifrs.org"/&gt;
* '''[[Financing cash flows]]''': activities that result in changes in the size and composition of the contributed equity and borrowings of the entity. These are important because they are useful in predicting claims on future cash flows by providers of capital to the entity.&lt;ref name="eifrs.ifrs.org"/&gt;

'''[[Notes to the Financial Statements]]''': These shall (a) present information about the basis of preparation of the financial statements and the specific accounting policies used; (b) disclose the information required by IFRSs that is not presented elsewhere in the financial statements; and (c) provide information that is not presented elsewhere in the financ|Statement of Cash Flowsial statements, but is relevant to an understanding of any of them.&lt;ref&gt;http://eifrs.ifrs.org/eifrs/bnstandards/en/2013/ias1.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

==Recognition of elements of financial statements==

An item is recognized in the financial statements when:&lt;ref&gt;[http://eifrs.ifrs.org/eifrs/bnstandards/en/2013/conceptualframework.pdf Paragraph 4.38 of the Conceptual Framework of IFRS ]&lt;/ref&gt;
* it is probable future economic benefit will flow to or from an entity.
* the resource can be reliably measured

In some cases specific standards  add additional conditions before recognition is possible or prohibit recognition altogether.

An example is the recognition of internally generated brands, mastheads, publishing titles, customer lists and items similar in substance, for which recognition is prohibited by IAS 38.&lt;ref&gt;[http://eifrs.ifrs.org/eifrs/bnstandards/en/2013/ias38.pdf Paragraph 63 of the IFRS standard IAS 38]&lt;/ref&gt; In addition research and development expenses can only be recognised as an intangible asset if they cross the threshold of being classified as 'development cost'.&lt;ref&gt;[http://eifrs.ifrs.org/eifrs/bnstandards/en/2013/ias38.pdf Paragraphs 54 and 57 of the IFRS standard IAS 38]&lt;/ref&gt;

Whilst the standard on provisions, IAS 37, prohibits the recognition of a provision for contingent liabilities,&lt;ref&gt;[http://eifrs.ifrs.org/eifrs/bnstandards/en/2013/ias37.pdf Paragraph 27 of the IFRS standard IAS 37]&lt;/ref&gt; this prohibition is not applicable to the accounting for contingent liabilities in a business combination. In that case the acquirer shall recognise a contingent liability even if it is not probable that an outflow of resources embodying economic benefits will be required.&lt;ref&gt;[http://eifrs.ifrs.org/eifrs/bnstandards/en/2013/ifrs3.pdf Paragraph 23 of the IFRS standard IFRS 3]&lt;/ref&gt;

International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) are designed as a common global language for business affairs so that company accounts are understandable and comparable across international boundaries.

==Capital Concept and capital maintenance==

===Concepts of capital===

Par. 102. A financial concept of capital is adopted by most entities in preparing their financial statements. Under a financial concept of capital, such as invested money or invested purchasing powers, capital is synonymous with the net assets or equity of the entity. Under a physical concept of capital, such as operating capability, capital is regarded as the productive capacity of the entity based on, for example, units of output per day.

Par. 103. The selection of the appropriate concept of capital by an entity should be based on the needs of the users of its financial statements. Thus, a financial concept of capital should be adopted if the users of financial statements are primarily concerned with the maintenance of nominal invested capital or the purchasing power of invested capital. If, however, the main concern of users is with the operating capability of the entity, a physical concept of capital should be used. The concept chosen indicates the goal to be attained in determining profit, even though there may be some measurement difficulties in making the concept operational.

===Concepts of capital maintenance and the determination of profit===

Par. 104. The concepts of capital in paragraph 102 give rise to the following two concepts of capital maintenance:

(a) Financial capital maintenance. Under this concept a profit is earned only if the financial (or money) amount of the net assets at the end of the period exceeds the financial (or money) amount of net assets at the beginning of the period, after excluding any distributions to, and contributions from, owners during the period. Financial capital maintenance can be measured in either [[nominal monetary units]] or [[units of constant purchasing power]].

(b) Physical capital maintenance. Under this concept a profit is earned only if the physical productive capacity (or operating capability) of the entity (or the resources or funds needed to achieve that capacity) at the end of the period exceeds the physical productive capacity at the beginning of the period, after excluding any distributions to, and contributions from, owners during the period.

The concepts of capital in paragraph 102 give rise to the following three concepts of capital during low inflation and deflation:

* (A) Physical capital.&lt;ref name="amazon.com"&gt;[https://www.amazon.com/dp/B008LAC0FE?keywords=B008LAC0FE#reader_B008LAC0FE] Smith, N.J. (2012) CONSTANT ITEM PURCHASING POWER ACCOUNTING per IFRS, Ch. 1.22.2 Three Concepts of Capital Maintenance&lt;/ref&gt; See paragraph 102&amp;103
* (B) Nominal financial capital.&lt;ref name="amazon.com"/&gt; See paragraph 104.&lt;ref&gt;[[Historical cost accounting]]&lt;/ref&gt;
* (C) Constant item purchasing power financial capital.&lt;ref name="amazon.com"/&gt; See paragraph 104.&lt;ref&gt;[[Constant Purchasing Power Accounting]]&lt;/ref&gt;

The concepts of capital in paragraph 102 give rise to the following three concepts of capital maintenance during low inflation and deflation:

* (1) '''Physical capital maintenance''':&lt;ref name="amazon.com"/&gt; optional during low inflation and deflation. Current Cost Accounting model prescribed by IFRS. See Par 106.
* (2) '''Financial capital maintenance in [[nominal monetary units]]''' ([[Historical cost accounting]]):&lt;ref name="amazon.com"/&gt; authorized by IFRS but not prescribed—optional during low inflation and deflation. See Par 104 (a) [[Historical cost accounting]]. Financial capital maintenance in [[nominal monetary units]] per se during inflation and deflation is a [[fallacy]]: it is impossible to maintain the real value of financial capital constant with measurement in nominal monetary units per se during inflation and deflation.
* (3) '''Financial capital maintenance in [[units of constant purchasing power]]'''&lt;ref name="amazon.com"/&gt; (Capital Maintenance in Units of Constant Purchasing Power):&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.amazon.com/dp/B008LAC0FE?keywords=constant+item+purchasing+power+accounting+per+ifrs|title=CONSTANT ITEM PURCHASING POWER ACCOUNTING per IFRS|date=13 July 2012|publisher=Nicolaas Smith}}&lt;/ref&gt; authorized by IFRS but not prescribed—optional during low inflation and deflation. See Par 104(a). Capital Maintenance in Units of Constant Purchasing Power is prescribed during hyperinflation in IAS 29:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iasb.org/IFRSs/IFRs.htm|title=IFRS|website=www.iasb.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; i.e. the restatement of Historical Cost or Current Cost period-end financial statements in terms of the period-end monthly published Consumer Price Index.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aasb.com.au/admin/file/content105/c9/Framework_07-04nd.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-07-26 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090521070422/http://www.aasb.com.au/admin/file/content105/c9/Framework_07-04nd.pdf |archivedate=21 May 2009 |df=dmy-all }} Framework for the Preparation and Presentation of Financial Statements, Par 104&lt;/ref&gt; Only financial capital maintenance in [[units of constant purchasing power]] (Capital Maintenance in Units of Constant Purchasing Power) in terms of a daily index per se can automatically maintain the real value of financial capital constant at all levels of inflation and deflation in all entities that at least break even in real value—ceteris paribus—for an indefinite period of time. This would happen whether these entities own re-valuable fixed assets or not and without the requirement of more capital or additional retained profits to simply maintain the existing constant real value of existing shareholders' equity constant. Financial capital maintenance in units of constant purchasing power requires the calculation and accounting of net monetary losses and gains from holding monetary items during low inflation and deflation. The calculation and accounting of net monetary losses and gains during low inflation and deflation have thus been authorized in IFRS since 1989.

Par. 105. The concept of capital maintenance is concerned with how an entity defines the capital that it seeks to maintain. It provides the linkage between the concepts of capital and the concepts of profit because it provides the point of reference by which profit is measured; it is a prerequisite for distinguishing between an entity's return on capital and its return of capital; only inflows of assets in excess of amounts needed to maintain capital may be regarded as profit and therefore as a return on capital. Hence, profit is the residual amount that remains after expenses (including capital maintenance adjustments, where appropriate) have been deducted from income. If expenses exceed income the residual amount is a loss.

Par. 106. The physical capital maintenance concept requires the adoption of the current cost basis of measurement. The financial capital maintenance concept, however, does not require the use of a particular basis of measurement. Selection of the basis under this concept is dependent on the type of financial capital that the entity is seeking to maintain.

Par. 107. The principal difference between the two concepts of capital maintenance is the treatment of the effects of changes in the prices of assets and liabilities of the entity. In general terms, an entity has maintained its capital if it has as much capital at the end of the period as it had at the beginning of the period. Any amount over and above that required to maintain the capital at the beginning of the period is profit.

Par. 108. Under the concept of financial capital maintenance where capital is defined in terms of nominal monetary units, profit represents the increase in nominal money capital over the period. Thus, increases in the prices of assets held over the period, conventionally referred to as holding gains, are, conceptually, profits. They may not be recognised as such, however, until the assets are disposed of in an exchange transaction. When the concept of financial capital maintenance is defined in terms of constant purchasing power units, profit represents the increase in invested purchasing power over the period. Thus, only that part of the increase in the prices of assets that exceeds the increase in the general level of prices is regarded as profit. The rest of the increase is treated as a capital maintenance adjustment and, hence, as part of equity.

Par. 109. Under the concept of physical capital maintenance when capital is defined in terms of the physical productive capacity, profit represents the increase in that capital over the period. All price changes affecting the assets and liabilities of the entity are viewed as changes in the measurement of the physical productive capacity of the entity; hence, they are treated as capital maintenance adjustments that are part of equity and not as profit.

Par. 110. The selection of the measurement bases and concept of capital maintenance will determine the accounting model used in the preparation of the financial statements. Different accounting models exhibit different degrees of relevance and reliability and, as in other areas, management must seek a balance between relevance and reliability. This Framework is applicable to a range of accounting models and provides guidance on preparing and presenting the financial statements constructed under the chosen model. At the present time, it is not the intention of the Board of IASC to prescribe a particular model other than in exceptional circumstances, such as for those entities reporting in the currency of a hyper-inflationary economy. This intention will, however, be reviewed in the light of world developments.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"&gt;[http://www.iasb.org/IFRSs/IFRs.htm] Full text of the Framework&lt;/ref&gt;

==Requirements==
{{main|Requirements of IFRS}}
IFRS financial statements consist of (IAS1.8)
* a [[Statement of Financial Position]]
* a [[Statement of Comprehensive Income]] separate statements comprising an [[Income Statement]] and separately a Statement of Comprehensive Income, which reconciles Profit or Loss on the Income statement to total [[comprehensive income]]
* a [[Statement of Changes in Equity]] (SOCE)
* a [[Cash Flow Statement]] or [[Statement of Cash Flows]]
* notes, including a summary of the significant accounting policies

Comparative information is required for the prior reporting period (IAS 1.36). An entity preparing IFRS accounts for the first time must apply IFRS in full for the current and comparative period although there are transitional exemptions (IFRS1.7).

On 6 September 2007, the IASB issued a revised [[IAS 1]] Presentation of Financial Statements. The main changes from the previous version are to require that an entity must:

* present all non-owner changes in equity (that is, 'comprehensive income' ) ''either'' in one Statement of comprehensive income or in two statements (a separate income statement and a statement of comprehensive income). Components of comprehensive income may ''not'' be presented in the Statement of changes in equity.
* present a statement of financial position (balance sheet) as of the beginning of the earliest comparative period in a complete set of financial statements when the entity applies the new standard.
* present a statement of cash flow.
* make necessary disclosure by the way of a note.

The revised IAS 1 is effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2009. Early adoption is permitted.

==Criticisms==

In 2012 the US Securities and Exchange Commission Staff issued a 127-page report&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.sec.gov/spotlight/globalaccountingstandards/ifrs-work-plan-final-report.pdf Work Plan for the Consideration of Incorporating International Financial Reporting Standards into the Financial Reporting System for U.S. Issuers]&lt;/ref&gt; of potential issues with IFRS that would need to be addressed before adoption by the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://blogs.wsj.com/cfo/2012/07/13/sec-staff-offers-127-pages-of-reasons-not-to-adopt-ifrs/|title=SEC Staff Offers 127 Pages of Reasons Not to Adopt IFRS|first=Emily|last=Chasan|date=13 July 2012|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The staff of the IFRS Foundation provided a detailed answer on the main criticisms in the SEC staff report.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ifrs.org/Alerts/PressRelease/Pages/IFRS-Foundation-Staff-Analysis-of-SEC-Final-Staff-Report-on-IFRS.aspx&lt;/ref&gt;

A number of criticisms were voiced in the beginning of 2013 in the French media to which the IASB Board member Philippe Danjou responded in his document 'An Update on International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs).'&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ifrs.org/Features/Documents/Mise-au-point-concernant-les-normes-IFRS-19-eng-February-2013.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

It is widely acknowledged that ''IAS 29 Financial Reporting in Hyperinflationary Economies'' had no positive effect during the six years it was implemented during hyperinflation in Zimbabwe.&lt;ref&gt;[http://eifrs.ifrs.org/eifrs/comment_letters/27/27_3213_NicolaasSmithCapitalMaintenanceinUnitsofConstantPurchasingPower_0_NicolaasSmithCommentLettertotheConceptualFrameworkDiscussionPaper.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt;{{Citation needed|reason=One persuasive essay does not make something "widely acknowledged"|date=January 2017}} This led people{{Who|date=January 2017}} to ask the purpose of IAS 29.{{Citation needed|reason=Examples|date=January 2017}} As of March 2014, IAS 29 was being implemented in its original ineffective form{{Citation needed|reason=same as above|date=January 2017}} in Venezuela and Belarus. It was suggested to the IASB in 2012{{By whom|date=January 2017}} that IAS 29 should be corrected to require daily indexation which would result in effective [[constant purchasing power accounting]] and would stabilize the non-monetary economy during hyperinflation. The IASB has offered no response to date (March 2014) to this criticism and has not yet altered IAS 29 to require daily indexation.

==Adoption==

IFRS are used in many parts of the world, including the [[South Korea]], [[European Union]], [[India]], [[Hong Kong]], [[Australia]], [[Malaysia]], [[Pakistan]], [[Cooperation Council for the Arab States of the Gulf|GCC countries]], [[Russia]], [[Chile]], [[Philippines]], [[South Africa]], [[Singapore]] and [[Turkey]], but not in the United States. 

It is generally expected that IFRS adoption worldwide will be beneficial to investors and other users of financial statements, by reducing the costs of comparing alternative investments and increasing the quality of information.&lt;ref name=Ball2006/&gt; Companies are also expected to benefit, as investors will be more willing to provide financing.&lt;ref name=Ball2006/&gt; Companies that have high levels of international activities are among the group that would benefit from a switch to IFRS. Companies that are involved in foreign activities and investing benefit from the switch due to the increased comparability of a set accounting standard.&lt;ref&gt;Bradshaw, M., ''et al'' (2010). Response to the SEC's Proposed Rule- Roadmap for the Potential Use of Financial Statements Prepared in Accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) by U.S. Issuers. ''Accounting Horizons''(24)1&lt;/ref&gt; However, [[Ray J. Ball]] has expressed some skepticism of the overall cost of the international standard; he argues that the enforcement of the standards could be lax, and the regional differences in accounting could become obscured behind a label. He also expressed concerns about the fair value emphasis of IFRS and the influence of accountants from non-[[common-law]] regions, where losses have been recognized in a less timely manner.&lt;ref name=Ball2006&gt;Ball R. (2006).

''Accounting and Business Research''&lt;/ref&gt;

To assess progress towards the goal of a single set global accounting standards, the IFRS Foundation has developed and posted profiles about the use of IFRSs in individual jurisdictions. These were based on information from various sources. The starting point was the responses provided by standard-setting and other relevant bodies to a survey that the IFRS Foundation conducted. Currently, profiles are completed for 124 jurisdictions, including all of the G20 jurisdictions plus 104 others. Eventually, the plan is to have a profile for every jurisdiction that has adopted IFRSs, or is on a programme toward adoption of IFRSs.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ifrs.org/Use-around-the-world/Pages/Jurisdiction-profiles.aspx Profiles of the IFRS Foundation]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Australia===
The [[Australian Accounting Standards Board]] (AASB) has issued 'Australian equivalents to IFRS' (A-IFRS), numbering IFRS standards as AASB 1–8 and IAS standards as AASB 101–141.  Australian equivalents to SIC and IFRIC Interpretations have also been issued, along with a number of 'domestic' standards and interpretations.  These pronouncements replaced previous Australian generally accepted accounting principles with effect from annual reporting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2005 (i.e. 30 June 2006 was the first report prepared under IFRS-equivalent standards for June year ends).  To this end, Australia, along with Europe and a few other countries, was one of the initial adopters of IFRS for domestic purposes (in the developed world). It must be acknowledged, however, that IFRS and primarily IAS have been part and parcel of accounting standard package in the developing world for many years since the relevant accounting bodies were more open to adoption of international standards for many reasons including that of capability.

The AASB has made certain amendments to the IASB pronouncements in making A-IFRS, however these generally have the effect of eliminating an option under IFRS, introducing additional disclosures or implementing requirements for not-for-profit entities, rather than departing from IFRS for Australian entities.  Accordingly, for-profit entities that prepare financial statements in accordance with A-IFRS are able to make an unreserved statement of compliance with IFRS.

The AASB continues to mirror changes made by the IASB as local pronouncements.  In addition, over recent years, the AASB has issued so-called 'Amending Standards' to reverse some of the initial changes made to the IFRS text for local terminology differences, to reinstate options and eliminate some Australian-specific disclosure.  There are some calls for Australia to simply adopt IFRS without 'Australianising' them and this has resulted in the AASB itself looking at alternative ways of adopting IFRS in Australia.

===Brazil===

Brazil has already adopted IFRS for all companies whose securities are publicly traded and for most financial institutions whose securities are not publicly traded, for both consolidated and separate (individual) company financial statements.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ifrs.org/Use-around-the-world/Documents/Jurisdiction-profiles/Brazil-IFRS-Profile.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Canada===
The use of IFRS became a requirement for Canadian publicly accountable profit-oriented enterprises for financial periods beginning on or after 1 January 2011.  This includes public companies and other "profit-oriented enterprises that are responsible to large or diverse groups of shareholders."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=AcSB Confirms Changeover Date to IFRSs |url=http://www.cica.ca/ifrs/media-room/media-releases/2008/pf_item2992.aspx |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090907132445/http://www.cica.ca/ifrs/media-room/media-releases/2008/pf_item2992.aspx |dead-url=yes |archive-date=7 September 2009 |date=13 February 2008 |publisher=[[Canadian Institute of Chartered Accountants]] |accessdate=8 August 2009}} 
&lt;/ref&gt;

===European Union===
In 2002 the European Union agreed that from 1 January 2005 International Accounting Standards / International Financial Reporting Standards would apply for the consolidated accounts of the EU listed companies.&lt;ref&gt;http://ec.europa.eu/internal_market/accounting/legal_framework/ias_regulation/index_en.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

In order to be approved for use in the EU, standards must be endorsed by the Accounting Regulatory Committee (ARC), which includes representatives of member state governments and is advised by a group of accounting experts known as the [[European Financial Reporting Advisory Group]]. As a result, IFRS as applied in the EU may differ from that used elsewhere.

Parts of the standard [[IAS 39|IAS 39: Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement]] were not originally approved by the ARC. IAS 39 was subsequently amended, removing the option to record financial liabilities at fair value, and the ARC approved the amended version. The [[International Accounting Standards Board|IASB]] is working with the EU to find an acceptable way to remove a remaining anomaly in respect of [[hedge accounting]]. The [[World Bank]] [[Centre for Financial Reporting Reform]] is working with countries in the ECA region to facilitate the adoption of IFRS and IFRS for SMEs.

Whilst the IASB set the effective dates for the new consolidation standards IFRS 10 ''Consolidated Financial Statements'', IFRS 11 ''Joint Arrangements'' and IFRS 12 ''Disclosure of Interests in Other Entities'' at 1 January 2013, the ARC decided to delay the mandatory effective date for the companies listed in the European Union by one year. The standards therefore only became effective on 1 January 2014.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.efrag.org/Front/c1-306/Endorsement-Status-Report_EN.aspx&lt;/ref&gt;

The European Commission has launched a general analysis of the impacts of 8 years of use of international financial reporting standards (IFRSs) in the EU for preparers and users of financial statements from the private sector. The study will include an overall assessment of whether the Regulation 1606/2002 of the European Parliament and the Council ('IAS Regulation') has met the two-fold initial objectives of ensuring a high degree of transparency and comparability of the financial statements of European companies and an efficient functioning of the market, in comparison with the situation before IFRS implementation in 2005. It will also include a cost-benefit analysis and an assessment and analysis of the benefits and drawbacks brought by the IAS Regulation for different stakeholder groups.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ted.europa.eu/udl?uri=TED:NOTICE:202159-2013:DATA:EN:HTML&amp;tabId=3|title=Services - 202159-2013 - TED Tenders Electronic Daily|website=ted.europa.eu}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===India===
The [[Institute of Chartered Accountants of India]] (ICAI) has announced that IFRS will be mandatory in India for [[financial statements]] for the periods beginning on or after 1 April 2016 in a phased manner. There is a roadmap issued by MCA for adoption of IFRS.

[[Reserve Bank of India]] has stated that financial statements of banks need to be IFRS-compliant for periods beginning on or after 1 April 2011.

The ICAI has also stated that IFRS will be applied to companies above INR 1000 [[crore]] (INR 10 billion) from April 2011. Phase wise applicability details for different companies in India:

Phase 1: Opening balance sheet as of 1 April 2011*&lt;br&gt;
i. Companies which are part of NSE Index – Nifty 50&lt;br&gt;
ii. Companies which are part of BSE Index – Sensex 30

a. Companies whose shares or other securities are listed on a stock exchange outside India

b. Companies, whether listed or not, having net worth of more than INR 1000 crore (INR 10 billion)

Phase 2: Opening balance sheet as of 1 April 2012*

Companies not covered in phase 1 and having net worth exceeding INR 500 crore (INR 5 billion)

Phase 3: Opening balance sheet as of 1 April 2014*

Listed companies not covered in the earlier phases
&lt;nowiki&gt;*&lt;/nowiki&gt; If the financial year of a company commences at a date other than 1 April, then it shall prepare its opening balance sheet at the commencement of immediately following financial year.

On 22 January 2010, the Ministry of Corporate Affairs issued the road map for transition to IFRS. It is clear that India has deferred transition to IFRS by a year. In the first phase, companies included in Nifty 50 or BSE Sensex, and companies whose securities are listed on stock exchanges outside India and all other companies having net worth of INR 10&amp;nbsp;billion will prepare and present financial statements using Indian Accounting Standards converged with IFRS.
According to the press note issued by the government, those companies will convert their first balance sheet as of 1 April 2011, applying accounting standards convergent with IFRS if the accounting year ends on 31 March. This implies that the transition date will be 1 April 2011. According to the earlier plan, the transition date was fixed at 1 April 2010.

The press note does not clarify whether the full set of financial statements for the year 2011–12 will be prepared by applying accounting standards convergent with IFRS. The deferment of the transition may make companies happy, but it will undermine India's position. Presumably, lack of preparedness of Indian companies has led to the decision to defer the adoption of IFRS for a year. This is unfortunate that India, which boasts for its IT and accounting skills, could not prepare itself for the transition to IFRS over last four years. But that might be the ground reality.&lt;br&gt;
Transition in phases&lt;br&gt;
Companies, whether listed or not, having net worth of more than INR 5&amp;nbsp;billion will convert their opening balance sheet as of 1 April 2013. Listed companies having net worth of INR 5&amp;nbsp;billion or less will convert their opening balance sheet as of 1 April 2014. Un-listed companies having net worth of Rs5&amp;nbsp;billion or less will continue to apply existing accounting standards, which might be modified from time to time. Transition to IFRS in phases is a smart move.&lt;br&gt;
The transition cost for smaller companies will be much lower because large companies will bear the initial cost of learning and smaller companies will not be required to reinvent the wheel. However, this will happen only if a significant number of large companies engage Indian accounting firms to provide them support in their transition to IFRS. If, most large companies, which will comply with Indian accounting standards convergent with IFRS in the first phase, choose one of the international firms, Indian accounting firms and smaller companies will not benefit from the learning in the first phase of the transition to IFRS.&lt;br&gt;
It is likely that international firms will protect their learning to retain their competitive advantage. Therefore, it is for the benefit of the country that each company makes judicious choice of the accounting firm as its partner without limiting its choice to international accounting firms. Public sector companies should take the lead and the Institute of Chartered Accountants of India (ICAI) should develop a clear strategy to diffuse the learning.&lt;br&gt;
Size of companies&lt;br&gt;
The government has decided to measure the size of companies in terms of net worth. This is not the ideal unit to measure the size of a company. Net worth in the balance sheet is determined by accounting principles and methods. Therefore, it does not include the value of intangible assets. Moreover, as most assets and liabilities are measured at historical cost, the net worth does not reflect the current value of those assets and liabilities. Market capitalisation is a better measure of the size of a company.
But it is difficult to estimate market capitalisation or fundamental value of unlisted companies. This might be the reason that the government has decided to use 'net worth' to measure size of companies. Some companies, which are large in terms of fundamental value or which intend to attract foreign capital, might prefer to use Indian accounting standards convergent with IFRS earlier than required under the road map presented by the government. The government should provide that choice.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.business-standard.com/article/economy-policy/ifrs-transition-date-will-be-april-1-2011-110020800015_1.html |author=Ashish K Bhattacharyya |publisher=Business Standard |accessdate=2 August 2013 |title=IFRS: transition date will be april 1, 2011 |date=8 February 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Japan===
The minister for Financial Services in Japan announced in late June 2011 that mandatory application of the IFRS should not take place from fiscal year-ending March 2015; five to seven years should be required for preparation if mandatory application is decided; and to permit the use of U.S. GAAP beyon the fiscal year ending 31 March 2016.&lt;ref&gt;[http://search.proquest.com/docview/900127406 Update: IFRS Developments  Japan], October 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Montenegro]] gained independence from [[Serbia]] in 2006. Its accounting standard setter is the Institute of Accountants and Auditors of Montenegro (IAAM).&lt;ref name=WorldBank2007&gt;

===Nepal===
In Nepal the Accounting Standards Board (ASB) is in charge of standard setting. Nepal closely models its Financial Reporting Standards (FRS) according to the IFRS, with appropriate changes made to suit the Nepalese context. It has issued [[Nepal Financial Reporting Standards]] in 2013. The 2013 version of standards almost resembles IFRS with slight modification.

===Pakistan===
All listed companies must follow all issued IAS/IFRS except the following:&lt;br /&gt;
IAS 39 and IAS 41: Implementation of these standards has been held in abeyance by State Bank of Pakistan for Banks and DFIs&lt;br /&gt;
IFRS-1: Effective for the annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2004. This IFRS is being considered for adoption for all companies other than banks and DFIs.&lt;br /&gt;
IFRS-9: Under consideration of the relevant Committee of the Institutes (ICAP &amp; ICMAP). This IFRS will be effective for the annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2013.

===Russia===
The government of Russia has been implementing a program to harmonize its [[Russian GAAP|national accounting standards]] with IFRS since 1998.
Since then twenty new accounting standards were issued by the Ministry of Finance of the Russian Federation aiming to align accounting practices with IFRS. Despite these efforts essential differences between Russian accounting standards and IFRS remain.
Since 2004 all commercial banks have been obliged to prepare financial statements in accordance with both Russian accounting standards and IFRS.
Full transition to IFRS is delayed but starting 2012 new modifications making Russian GAAP converging to IFRS have been made. They notably include the booking of reserves for bad debts and contingent liabilities and the devaluation of inventory and financial assets.

Still, several differences between the two sets of account still remain.

===Singapore===
In Singapore the Accounting Standards Committee (ASC) is in charge of standard setting. Singapore closely models its Financial Reporting Standards (FRS) according to the IFRS, with appropriate changes made to suit the Singapore context.  Before a standard is enacted, consultations with the IASB are made to ensure consistency of core principles.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ccdg.gov.sg/account.htm Process of Prescribing Accounting Standards] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080220095548/http://www.ccdg.gov.sg/account.htm |date=20 February 2008 }}, Retrieved 29 February 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

===South Africa===
All companies listed on the [[Johannesburg Stock Exchange]] have been required to comply with the requirements of International Financial Reporting Standards since 1 January 2005.

The IFRS for SMEs may be applied by 'limited interest companies', as defined in the South African Corporate Laws Amendment Act of 2006 (that is, they are not 'widely held'), if they do not have public accountability (that is, not listed and not a financial institution). Alternatively, the company may choose to apply full South African Statements of GAAP or IFRS.

South African Statements of GAAP are entirely consistent with IFRS, although there may be a delay between issuance of an IFRS and the equivalent SA Statement of GAAP (can affect voluntary early adoption).

South African Statements of GAAP were withdrawn by the Financial Reporting Standards Council (FASC) per the South African Institute of Chartered Accountants (SAICA) for financial years commencing on or after 1 December 2012.

===Taiwan===

;Adoption scope and timetable

(1) Phase I companies: listed companies and financial institutions
supervised by the Financial Supervisory Commission (FSC), except for 
credit cooperatives, credit card companies and insurance intermediaries:
:A. They will be required to prepare financial statements in accordance with Taiwan-IFRS starting from 1 January 2013.
:B. Early optional adoption: Firms that have already issued securities overseas, or have registered an overseas securities issuance with
:the FSC, or have a market capitalization of greater than NT$10 billion, will be permitted to prepare additional consolidated financial statements&lt;ref group="TW-original" name="one" /&gt; in accordance with Taiwan-IFRS starting from 1 January 2012. If a company without subsidiaries is not required to prepare consolidated financial statements, it will be permitted to prepare additional individual financial statements on the above conditions.

(2) Phase II companies: unlisted public companies, credit cooperatives and credit card companies:
:A. They will be required to prepare financial statements in accordance with Taiwan-IFRS starting from 1 January 2019
:B. They will be permitted to apply Taiwan-IFRS starting from 1 January 2013.

(3) Pre-disclosure about the IFRS adoption plan, and the impact of adoption

To prepare properly for IFRS adoption, domestic companies
should propose an IFRS adoption plan and establish a specific
taskforce. They should also disclose the related information from 2
years prior to adoption, as follows:
:A. Phase I companies:
::(A) They will be required to disclose the adoption plan, and the impact of adoption, in 2011 annual financial statements, and in 2012 interim and annual financial statements.
::(B) Early optional adoption:
:::a. Companies adopting IFRS early will be required to disclose the adoption plan, and the impact of adoption, in 2010 annual financial statements, and in 2011 interim and annual financial statements.
:::b. If a company opts for early adoption of Taiwan-IFRS after 1 January 2011, it will be required to disclose the adoption plan, and the impact of adoption, in 2011 interim and annual financial statements commencing on the decision date.

:B. Phase II companies will be required to disclose the related information from 2 years prior to adoption, as stated above.

----
&lt;references group="TW-original"&gt;
&lt;ref name="one"&gt;To maintain the consistency of information declaration and supervision with other companies, the early adopted companies should still prepare individual and consolidated financial statements in accordance with domestic accounting standards.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/references&gt;

===Turkey===
The Banking Regulation and Supervision Agency and Capital Markets Board of Turkey translated IFRS into Turkish in 2002. Banks and Turkish companies listed on the Istanbul Stock Exchange are required to prepare IFRS reports since then. The Turkish Accounting Standards Board (called the Public Oversight Authority after 2011) also translated IFRS in 2005. The new Commercial Code came into force in 2012. The Public Oversight Authority is the only authorized board regarding auditing and financial reporting standards. Most businesses authorized by the Council of Ministers in addition to banks and Turkish companies listed on the Istanbul Stock Exchange are required to prepare IFRS reports since 2012.

===Zimbabwe===
Zimbabwe also adopted IFRS.

==Consequences of Adopting IFRS==
Many researchers have studied the effects of IFRS adoption, and there are debates on whether the effects can be attributed solely to IFRS mandate adoption. For example, one study&lt;ref&gt;[https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/1475-679X.12005 Daske, H. , Hail, L. , Leuz, C. and Verdi, R. (2013), Adopting a Label: Heterogeneity in the Economic Consequences Around IAS/IFRS Adoptions. Journal of Accounting Research, 51: 495-547.]&lt;/ref&gt; uses data from 26 countries to study the economic consequences of mandatory IFRS adoption. It shows that, on average, even though market liquidity increases around the time of the introduction of IFRS, it is unclear whether IFRS mandate adoption is the sole reason of observed market effects.  Firms’ reporting incentives, law enforcement, and increased comparability of financial reports can also explain the effects.

One of the key objectives of the IAS is to promote education in the field of investment analysis. The IAS runs various certificate courses in “Securities Investment Analysis” in conjunction with ''The Johannesburg School of Finance''[http://www.iassa.co.za/images/file/SecuritiesInvestmentAnalysi.pdf], as well as corporate specific courses, and training workshops for the [[Chartered Financial Analyst|CFA]], [[Chartered Alternative Investment Analyst|CAIA]] and [[Financial Risk Manager|FRM]].

The society publishes ''Investment Analysts Journal'' a bi-annual [[peer reviewed]] [[academic journal]] aimed at investment professionals. The journal is regarded as the premier South African finance journal and receives academic support from the [[University of Cape Town]], [[Stellenbosch University]] and the University of Pretoria's [[Gordon Institute of Business Science]].

==Status==
The IAS is a [[non-profit]] making body and was registered in 1969 as an "association not for gain." The IAS is managed by a ''[[pro bono]]'' board and one full-time Executive Officer. The current chairman is Ms. Nancy Chadehumbe, and the executive officer is Ms. Ann Marie Wood.

==History==
In 1865, Seth Milliken &amp; William Deering founded Deering Milliken Company, a small woolen fabrics distributor in Portland, Maine. In 1868, Seth Milliken moved the company headquarters to New York City, at that time the heart of the American textile industry. In 1884, the company invested in a new facility in [[Pacolet, South Carolina]], and from that investment the manufacturing operations grew.  Milliken &amp; Company headquarters moved to Spartanburg, SC in 1958 and included a dedicated research center on campus. Today, the company operates in a number of diverse disciplines, including [[specialty chemicals]], performance and protective textiles, floor coverings, specialty fabrics, and business consulting services.&lt;ref name="aboutus" /&gt;

==Company leadership==
[[Roger Milliken]] became president of the company on the death of his father in 1947 and served in that capacity until 1983, when he became chairman and chief executive officer of Milliken &amp; Company, naming Dr. Thomas J. Malone as president and chief operating officer. In 2002, Malone retired, and Dr. Ashley Allen was named president and COO, becoming CEO in 2006 as Milliken stepped aside from daily management. In 2008, Allen retired and was succeeded by Dr. Joe Salley. In October 2016, J. Harold Chandler, who has served on Milliken's board for over a decade,&lt;ref&gt;http://gsabusiness.com/news/manufacturing/70717/&lt;/ref&gt; was appointed as chairman, and interim president and chief executive officer. On July 11, 2018 it was announced that Halsey M. Cook Jr. will take the helm as Milliken's next President and CEO, Effective September 1, 2018. Harold Chandler will continue in his roll as Chairman of the Board.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.milliken.com/en-us/ourcompany/newsandmedia/Pages/Halsey_Cook_Announcement.aspx&lt;/ref&gt;

==Manufacturing base==
Milliken &amp; Company has more than 7,000 associates and operated over 40 manufacturing facilities in the United States, United Kingdom, Belgium, France, Mexico and China.&lt;ref name="aboutus" /&gt;
Milliken serves a variety of industries including transportation, building and infrastructure, hospitality, industrial manufacturing, architecture and design, and specialty chemicals.

== Industrial musicals ==

From 1956 to 1980, Milliken sponsored an annual company musical, the Milliken Breakfast Show, at the [[Waldorf Astoria New York|Waldorf-Astoria]] for its buyers to launch the new season.  Stars who appeared in these productions included [[René Auberjonois|Rene Auberjonois]], [[Dom DeLuise]], [[Bert Lahr]], [[Dorothy Loudon]], [[Sarah Jessica Parker]], [[Juliet Prowse]], and [[Tommy Tune]]. The cost of these productions could exceed the cost of a public Broadway show. For example, the 1970 production on the lighter side of garment manufacturing life, directed by [[Peter Howard (conductor)|Peter Howard]], cost nearly $1 million for 13 performances, with an audience of approximately 25,000 Milliken buyers. No recordings of these musicals are known to exist.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2014/02/02/theater/industrial-musicals-were-once-big-shows.html|title=Industrial Musicals Were Once Big Shows|last=Grimes|first=William|date=2014|work=The New York Times|access-date=2018-04-28|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1970/05/27/archives/fall-buying-begun-by-milliken-show-milliken-opens-its-annual-show.html|title=Fall Buying Begun By Milliken Show|last=Sloane|first=Leonard|date=1970-05-27|work=The New York Times|access-date=2018-04-28|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=|title=Milliken Breakfast to Cost $1 Million|last=|first=|date=May 14, 1970|work=Women's Wear Daily|access-date=|issue=94|volume=130|page=30}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Whisenant|first=Dava|title=Bathtubs Over Broadway|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt6029778/|others=Martin Short, Florence Henderson, David Letterman|accessdate=2018-04-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background and education==
Nelly was born and raised in Kenya. She is the middle child and only girl in a family of three siblings. She attended Kapsabet Academy Primary School in [[Nandi County]] and Eregi Girls Boarding Primary School, in [[Kakamega County]] for her elementary schooling. She then transferred to Saint Mary's Tachasis Girls High School, in Nandi County, graduating from high school in 2002.&lt;ref name="Three"&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.standardmedia.co.ke/lifestyle/article/2000093551/homegrown-beauty | title=Homegrown beauty | accessdate=25 November 2017 |last=Genga 
|date=15 September 2013 |first=Shirley |newspaper=[[The Standard (Kenya)]]  |location=Nairobi}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After high school, Nelly's mother could not afford college fees. Instead, Nelly volunteered at [http://www.ampathkenya.org/our-programs/children's-services/sally-test-paediatric-centre-(stpc)/ Sally Test Paediatric Centre], in [[Eldoret]]. While there, she met Stephen Leapman and his wife Judy Leapman, who volunteered to sponsor her education at [[Indiana University]] and to host her while in the United States. She graduated from the [[Indiana University School of Nursing|IU School of Nursing]] with a [[Bachelor of Science in Nursing]] (BSN) degree.&lt;ref name="Three"/&gt;

==Career==
After college, she started working as a critical care nurse in the state of [[Indiana]], in the [[United States]]. However, in 2010, she began to explore the possibility of starting a beauty line of products geared towards [[Africa]]n women. With US$400 (approx. Sh40,800), Nelly Tuikong started Pauline Cosmetics (named after her mother). She researched online and approached [[Kiralee Hubbard]], an American makeup artist who owns [[Eye Max Cosmetics]] for advice and mentor ship. Nelly chose to start with four product lines; [[lip stick]], [[lip gloss]], [[mascara]] and [[eye shadow]].&lt;ref name="Four"&gt;{{cite web|accessdate=15 November 2017 | url=http://www.businessdailyafrica.com/Cosmetics-firm-bets-big-on-the-African-woman/1248928-3067544-ssbd51z/index.html | title=Cosmetics firm bets big on the African woman |date=8 February 2016 |first=Isabella |last=Mukumu |location=Nairobi | newspaper=[[Business Daily Africa]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2012 she relocated back to her native Kenya and settled in Eldoret. After about three years of making start-up mistakes (she ordered her first large batch of cosmetics before she developed the market), she started to distribute her line through retail outlets in a sustainable manner. As of February 2016, she was supplying to over 40 retail outlets in Kenya, with plans to expand to other East African countries, including [[Uganda]] and [[Rwanda]].&lt;ref name="One"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Two"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Three"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Four"/&gt;

==Other considerations==
In October 2017, Nelly Tuikong was named among "The Top 40 Women Under 40 in Kenya 2017", by [[Business Daily Africa]], an English language business daily newspaper published by the [[Nation Media Group]].&lt;ref name="One"/&gt;

'''''Nickelodeon Launch Box''''' is an educational television series that was produced jointly by [[Nickelodeon]] and [[NASA]]. It was meant to teach kids about space travel technology. As part of the [[Cable in the Classroom]] service, the show was intended to be taped by teachers and shown in the classroom. Each episode also included a teachers portion before and after where ideas for lessons and other aides were discussed. The show was taped before a live studio audience at [[Nickelodeon Studios]] and made use of many sets for Nickelodeon shows such as ''[[What Would You Do? (game show)|What Would You Do?]]'' and ''[[Double Dare (1986 game show)|Double Dare]]''. 

The show aired on [[Nickelodeon]] from 1991 to 1994, and continued in reruns on the network until September 1, 2000.

'''Positive assurance''' is a statement as to what the [[Certified Public Accountant|CPA]]{{Clarify|date=January 2011}} believes. An example is an opinion that the [[financial statement]]s are presented fairly in conformity with [[United States|U.S.]] [[Generally Accepted Accounting Principles|GAAP]].

The opposite is [[negative assurance]], a statement about what the CPA does not know. A statement that the CPA was "not aware of material modifications that should be made to financial statements for them to conform with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles" is negative assurance used in review reports.

Part of the field called Human Systems Intervention, process consultation is a philosophy of helping, a general theory and methodology of intervening ([[Edgar Schein|Schein]], Process Consultations, 1992 revisited). 

A process consultant is a highly qualified professional that has insights into and understands the psychosocial dynamics of working with various client systems such as whole organizations, groups, and individuals. 

Given the complex nature of intervening, a process consultant's expertise includes the following (and many other) aspects:
a)	works concomitantly with groups and individuals (managers/directors) towards a larger change process such as strategic visioning, strategic planning, etc.
b)	based on the context, selects from a variety of methods, tools and change theories a 'facilitative intervention' that will most benefit the client system;
c)	stays aware of covert organizational processes, group dynamics, and interpersonal issues;

==Role in Organizational Development==

In [[organization development]], a process consultant is a specialized type of consultant who acts as a [[facilitator]] to help groups deal with issues involving the process in a meeting, rather than with the actual tasks themselves.
==Role in Small Group Development==
A process consultant may be used at any time during the [[Stages of Group Development]]. Occasionally, a process consultant is used when a group is either in its formative stage, or normative stage. However, more often than not, they participate when the group is in [[:wikt:conflict|conflict]].

==Role in Conflict Resolution==
Often a group finds itself in conflict over [[fact]]s, [[goal]]s, [[Scientific method|methods]] or [[Value (personal and cultural)|values]]. It is the role of the process consultant to help the group reach [[consensus]] over the type of conflict it faces.

Once the type of conflict is identified, the process consultant then helps the group work through the steps required to break the impasse.

It is important to note that the process consultant's role is not to solve the problem, but to help the group solve its own problem.  The reason for this is because it is the group, not the consultant who will have to live with the [[Consequentialism|consequences]] of its decision.

==Role in Conflict Management==

Occasionally, due to the nature of conflict, the process consultant may need to guide the group toward [[conflict management]] rather than [[conflict resolution]].

==Techniques Used==
Initially a process consultant will not lead or participate in a group meeting, but rather will act as an [[observation|observer]]. During this time, they observe the [[group dynamics]] to determine what [[interpersonal]] relationships may contribute to the group's issues.

At some point, s/he will begin to actively participate in the meeting, by asking clarifying questions or [[paraphrasing]].  Eventually, s/he will make his/her observations known by giving the group [[feedback]].

==Education Required==
To enter this field, a background in [[psychology]] and [[small group learning]] is helpful. Experience in reading [[body language]] and possessing [[Analytical skills]] is also useful. However, receiving some training in [[experiential education]] will probably be the most beneficial.

'''Roberto de Assis Moreira''', commonly known as '''Assis''' (born January 10, 1971), is a former [[association football|football]]er&lt;ref name="sambafoot"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://en.sambafoot.com/players/934_Assis.html|title=Assis|publisher=Sambafoot|date=November 27, 2009|accessdate=January 10, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; who is the brother, manager, agent and adviser of [[Brazil]]ian footballer [[Ronaldinho]].

==Biography==
Although Assis is known predominantly for his intelligent managing of better known and more illustrious younger brother [[Ronaldinho]]'s career, he himself was a budding football talent in his youth. In fact, Brazilian club [[Grêmio Foot-Ball Porto Alegrense|Grêmio]] offered Assis' family a villa in order to keep the promising youngster with the club.

Previously, the family had lived in a wooden house in the middle of a ''[[favela]]'' or [[slum]] in [[Porto Alegre]], in the south of Brazil. At this time, João (his father), a solderer by trade, often worked as a car park security guard at [[Grêmio Foot-Ball Porto Alegrense|Grêmio]]'s stadium in order to supplement his meager income.

Roberto's success as a footballer helped his family leave the slots behind for a more comfortable home, but his hopes of playing top-level football with [[Grêmio Foot-Ball Porto Alegrense|Grêmio]] were all but destroyed when he suffered a serious knee injury, which led him to play football in Switzerland. He played for [[FC Sion|Sion]] in 1992-1995 and 1996-1998. With Sion he won two [[Swiss Cup|Cups]] in [[1994–95 in Swiss football|1995]] and [[1996–97 in Swiss football|1997]] and became [[Swiss Super League|Swiss Champion]] that year. Then he went to stints in Japan and Mexico.

Years later, Roberto's younger brother Ronaldo (now known only as [[Ronaldinho]]), would emerge as an even hotter talent at [[Grêmio Foot-Ball Porto Alegrense|Grêmio]]'s youth set-up before departing his home country for French side [[Paris Saint-Germain|PSG]] and eventually Spanish club [[FC Barcelona|Barcelona]], whom he was with for five years, before departing for [[AC Milan|Milan]] in 2008.

Today, Assis acts as his brother's agent and adviser, and is credited by many, including [[Ronaldinho]] himself, as a major influence and guiding force of the player.

During his acceptance speech after receiving the [[FIFA World Player of the Year]] award for a second consecutive year in December 2005, Ronaldinho paid tribute to his brother: "He's my idol. He's been through a lot and has helped me every step of the way. He has encouraged me never to stop trying."

Assis also owns Brazilian club [[Porto Alegre Futebol Clube|Porto Alegre]], which currently plays the [[Campeonato Gaúcho]].

'''Scoring''' is a process in which one cuts a groove into rigid material (usually [[tile]], [[Rock (geology)|stone]], [[glass]], etc.).  This groove is used to either break the material along the slit, for decoration, or act as a guideline for other processes such as painting. It can also be used to allow materials to expand and contract under varying thermal conditions. Scoring is used in place of cutting through the material all the way because you can obtain relatively the same results with less time and labor.

==Disadvantages of scoring==
&lt;!-- Image with unknown copyright status removed: [[Image:scoring.JPG|thumb|200px|right|1. Groove &lt;br /&gt;2. Jagged edge from breakage{{deletable image-caption|1=Monday, 9 February 2009}}]] --&gt;
* When breaking along the score line the material may deviate from the set guideline. 
* The back side of the break line has a jagged edge to it from the shear fracture.  
* Scoring offers very little use to metallic materials.

==Decorations==
Scoring is most commonly used in concrete work for decoration by making the grooves appear to be grout lines from tile work.

'''''Space Station Tycoon''''' was a [[video game]] to be released in the future for the [[Wii]] developed by [[Wahoo Studios]] (developer of [[Outpost Kaloki X]]) and published by [[Namco Bandai]]. In this [[business simulation game]], players take on the role of Shawn and his monkey sidekick, Tam, as they build and maintain [[space station]]s. The game also features 30 other characters. It features a level-based system, where gamers have to complete a set of mission objectives—including "light puzzle solving"—to progress to the next stage and further expand their empire.

The game lets players use the motion sensing of the [[Wii Remote]] to create gravity points and interact with objects in the environment. As well as undertaking tasks such as catching asteroids to stop them from smashing into the space station and lobbing cannonballs at space pirates. There is also a [[Multiplayer video game|multiplayer]] mode and [[co-op]] play elements.

'''Tammy Barton (née May)''' is an Australian entrepreneur and the founder of [[MyBudget]].

== Personal life ==
'''Tammy Barton (née May)'''

Tammy Barton (née May) is an Australian entrepreneur, businessperson and personal finance expert. She is the founding director of MyBudget,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.mybudget.com.au|title=MyBudget|website=|dead-url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; a personal budgeting service based in Australia that aims to help people take control of their finances through budgeting and money management.

She has won many awards, including twice being awarded the Telstra Business Woman of the Year (Entrepreneur-South Australia), 2007 and 2017. Barton is recognised as one of Australia's most influential businesswomen&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.afr.com/news/meet-australias-100-women-of-influence-20121011-jiosz|title=Meet Australia's 100 Women of Influence|last=Hooper, Narelle and Fox|first=Catherine|date=12 October 2012|website=Australian Financial Review|dead-url=|access-date=22 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and she regularly appears in the media as an expert on personal money management and household budgeting.

== Career ==
Barton started MyBudget as a home-based business in Adelaide in 1999 at the age of 22 after working at a debt collection agency where she witnessed the damaging effects of financial stress on people.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.afr.com/business/financial-freedom-just-a-budget-away-20120509-jyzl4|title=Financial freedom just a budget away|website=Australian Financial Review|dead-url=|access-date=22 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.adelaidenow.com.au/business/sa-business-journal/south-australian-tammy-mays-mybudget-business-aimed-at-helping-people-budget-is-making-an-impact-in-different-ways/news-story/2dc8b758510104f36de7ca6d9c1fc676|title=South Australian Tammy May's MyBudget business aimed at helping people budget is making an impact in different ways|last=Moss|first=Cory|date=2 March 2004|website=The Advertiser|dead-url=|access-date=22 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The business has since grown into a national company that employs more than 250 staff in 15 offices across Australia. During that time, the company has delivered its money management services to more than 65,000 clients.

On 26 October 2012, Barton became an appointee to the BankSA Advisory Board. Chairman Rob Chapman said Barton brought "strong credentials and a passionate commitment to helping South Australia prosper and grow".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.adelaidenow.com.au/business/new-faces-for-banksa/news-story/fe8c4f9652819cf0257f13806ec45604|title=MyBudget founder Tammy May and former Ernst &amp; Young SA managing partner Mark Butcher join BankSA advisory board|last=Booth|first=Meredith|date=22 October 2012|website=The Advertiser|dead-url=|access-date=22 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; To this day, Barton remains director of and spokesperson for MyBudget.

For her business achievements, Barton has been recognised with a number of awards and honours, see below. During her acceptance speech at the Telstra South Australian Business Woman of the Year Awards in October 2017, Barton announced that MyBudget would be opening its first international branch, in the United Kingdom, in 2018 to further what she described as her "commitment to helping lead the global financial fitness movement.”

== Awards and recognition ==
Barton has won numerous awards throughout her career including being a two-time winner of the Telstra South Australian Business Woman of the Year Award (2007 and 2017). She has appeared in SmartCompany's list of Australia's Top 30 Female Entrepreneurs in 2015 through to 2017 and was awarded Female Entrepreneur of the Year by the League of Extraordinary Women in 2015.

'''''The Challenger Sale''''' is the first non-fiction book by Matthew Dixon, Brent Adamson, and their colleagues at [[CEB Inc.]]. The book was published on November 10, 2011 by [[Penguin Group|Portfolio/Penguin]]. In the text, the book argues that relationship-building is no longer the best sales method. To sell complex, large-scale business-to-business solutions, customers are changing how they buy so sales people must change how they sell. The authors’ study found that sales reps fall into one of five profiles, and the challenger seller is the highest performer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Lisa Nirell|title=Trends In B2B Sales And Marketing From "The Challenger Sale"|url=https://www.fastcompany.com/3005114/trends-b2b-sales-and-marketing-challenger-sale|website=Fast Company|accessdate=28 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=A 5-Minute Summary Of "The Challenger Sale" Book Your Boss Told You To Read|url=http://blog.hubspot.com/sales/challenger-sale-summary#sm.00000f7la2tpe0ea9wtu5l8bjrndr|website=Hubspot|accessdate=28 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2000, TradeWinds added an online edition which is continuously updated from Singapore, London and Stamford. The TradeWinds App was launched in 2012 and is available on both iOS and Android. And in 2013, these platforms were joined by TW+, a quarterly glossy magazine that has continued the TradeWinds tradition of shaking up the way shipping is covered.

:''Leedo redirects here. For the similar-sounding word, see [[Lido (disambiguation)]]''
'''Vjatšeslav Leedo''' (born 1952) is the [[stockholder]]{{clarify|date=May 2017|reason="The stockholder" is extremely vague. Is he the sole shareholder? Or at least the majority shareholder? Please specify.}} of [[Saaremaa Shipping Company]], and due to a number of controversial remarks, commonly recognised as the 'face' of the company.  Particularly known are his frequently voiced opposition towards building a bridge between [[Virtsu]] and [[Kuivastu]], a transit route currently served by Saaremaa Shipping Company, and yearly allegations{{Citation needed|date=May 2017}} regarding his orders, supposedly deliberately too early, to begin [[ice breaking]] on the route.  This procedure breaks the [[ice road]] between [[Virtsu]] and [[Kuivastu]].  The ice road is free to use for everybody, but when it's broken, transit must be done by ferry service, and this profits Saaremaa Shipping Company.

The West Baltimore Innovation Village District is a neighborhood district of Baltimore City that will specialize in attracting [[Startup company|startup companies]] and other employers to West Baltimore. Following the [[Death of Freddie Gray]] and the subsequent [[2015 Baltimore protests]], government leaders decided to launch the innovation district as a way to attract redevelopment and revitalization to the areas hardest hit by the protests. The district includes the neighborhoods of [[Mondawmin, Baltimore|Mondawmin]], [[Coppin Heights, Baltimore|Coppin Heights]], [[Penn-North, Baltimore|Penn-North]], [[Reservoir Hill, Baltimore|Reservoir Hill]] and [[Bolton Hill, Baltimore|Bolton Hill]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.bizjournals.com/baltimore/news/2016/01/18/innovation-village-a-plan-to-revitalize-west.html#i2&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
Efforts to form the district originated from the community organization known as the Mount Royal Community Development Corporation (MRCDC).&lt;ref&gt;http://www.innovatebaltimore.org/&lt;/ref&gt; Similar innovation districts have been formed in neighborhoods like [[University City, Philadelphia|University City]] in [[Philadelphia]] and the [[South Boston|South Boston Seaport District]].&lt;ref&gt;http://technical.ly/baltimore/2016/01/18/meet-group-neighbors-spearheading-west-baltimores-innovation-district/&lt;/ref&gt; The West Baltimore Innovation District neighbors the nearby [[Station North Arts and Entertainment District]] and includes access to numerous forms of transportation including the [[Baltimore Metro Subway]] and [[Baltimore Light Rail]].
