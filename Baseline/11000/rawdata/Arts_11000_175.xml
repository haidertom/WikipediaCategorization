{{for|the minor planet|17776 Troska}}
'''''17776''''', also known as '''''What Football Will Look Like in the Future''''', is a serialized [[speculative fiction]] multimedia narrative by [[Jon Bois]] published online through [[SB Nation]]. Set in the distant future, the series follows three [[Space probe|space probes]] that have gained sentience and watch humanity play an evolved form of [[American football]], in which games can be played for millennia over distances of thousands of miles. The series debuted on July 5, 2017, and new chapters were published daily until the series concluded ten days later with its twenty-fifth chapter on July 15.

Bois began developing ''17776'' in 2016. Because the story incorporates text, animated [[GIF]]s, still images, and videos hosted on [[YouTube]], new tools were developed to allow it to be hosted efficiently on the SB Nation website. The work explores themes of consciousness, hope, despair, and why humans play sports. ''17776'' was well received by critics, who praised it for its innovative use of its medium and for the depth of emotion it evoked. In 2018, the story won a [[National Magazine Awards|National Magazine Award]] for Digital Innovation and was longlisted for a [[Hugo Award for Best Graphic Story]].

== Premise ==
[[File:Pioneer-6-9.jpg|thumb|A newly sentient ''Pioneer 9'' is one of the main characters of ''17776''.|alt=A barrel-like space probe with several antennae floats through red-black space.]]
The story takes place on an Earth where humans stopped dying, aging, and being born in 2026. All social ills were subsequently eliminated, and technology preventing humans from any injury was developed. In the United States, [[American football]] evolved to include new rules, including those that allow fields thousands of miles long, hundreds of in-game players, and games millennia long. Over time, computers gained [[sentience]] due to constant exposure to broadcast human data.

By the year 17776, the [[space probe]] ''[[Pioneer 9]]'' (called Nine) has gained sentience and made contact with ''[[Pioneer 10]]'' (called Ten) and the [[Jupiter Icy Moons Explorer]] (called Juice). As Nine adjusts to a world radically different from that of the [[20th century]], the three space probes watch multiple football games occurring across the United States: a game using the entirety of [[Nebraska]] as a field in which the next point scored wins the game; a game in which players strive to possess every existing football signed by [[Koy Detmer]]; a game played between the [[Canada–United States border|Canadian border]] and the [[Mexico–United States border|Mexican border]] deadlocked for 13,000 years at the bottom of a [[Canyon|gorge]] in [[Arizona]]; an [[National Football League|NFL]] regulation game between the [[Denver Broncos]] and the [[Pittsburgh Steelers]] that changed over 15,000 years into 58 playing teams owning and capitalizing upon portions of the field while the ball is lost; a [[500 (ball game)|500]] game that results in the destruction of the [[Centennial Light]]; and a game in which the possessing player is attempting to score an automatic win by hiding in his team's [[end zone]] for 10,000 years.

==Format==
''17776'' is read by [[scrolling]] through pages occupied by large [[GIF]] images and colored dialogue text, interspersed with occasional [[YouTube]] videos. The story is divided into chapters, which were originally published in daily installments between July 5 and July 15, 2017.&lt;ref name=Quartz&gt;{{cite web|url=https://qz.com/1024077/an-explanation-of-sb-nations-what-football-will-look-like-in-the-future-17776-by-jon-bois/|work=[[Quartz (publication)|Quartz]]|title=A dazzling new piece of experimental fiction is being serialized on a sports news site|last=Ha|first=Thu-Huong|date=July 8, 2017|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171115195343/https://qz.com/1024077/an-explanation-of-sb-nations-what-football-will-look-like-in-the-future-17776-by-jon-bois/|archivedate=November 15, 2017|accessdate=September 7, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Development ==
Bois wrote and illustrated ''17776'' for [[Vox Media]]'s sports news website [[SB Nation]], of which he is creative director. Aside from ''17776'', Bois produces two other recurring, humorous video essay programs for the site: ''Pretty Good'', which focuses on unusual sports topics and stories, and ''Chart Party'',  which focuses on statistics and has an emphasis on Bois' use of visual art in his journalism and storytelling.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Russell|first1=Lars|title=SB Nation’s Jon Bois shows Seahawks are "Least Volatile" in NFL|url=https://www.fieldgulls.com/2017/8/23/16193930/seattle-seahawks-chart-party-jon-bois-least-volatile-team-30-years|website=Field Gulls|accessdate= September 4, 2017|publisher=[[SB Nation]]|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170904063758/https://www.fieldgulls.com/2017/8/23/16193930/seattle-seahawks-chart-party-jon-bois-least-volatile-team-30-years|archivedate=September 4, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bois is also known for the ''Breaking Madden'' series, in which he attempted unusual scenarios in the ''[[Madden NFL]]'' series of video games.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

In early 2016, Bois began developing an "anti-sci fi" project as a possible sequel to ''The [[Tim Tebow]] CFL Chronicles'', an earlier work for SB Nation, and set the story in a year far enough in the future that "nobody ever thinks about it." Although he liked the concept and the visuals, he believed the project would not connect with readers and shelved it.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Later, he realized that the story needed a centering character; he wrote one in the form of a small town, [[AM broadcasting|AM radio]] [[talk show]] host before coming up with the characters of the probes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.sbnation.com/2017/7/24/16003968/17776-questions-and-answers|title=17776: Questions and answers|date=July 24, 2017|website=[[SB Nation]]|publisher=|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170904070557/https://www.sbnation.com/2017/7/24/16003968/17776-questions-and-answers|archive-date=September 4, 2017|dead-url=|access-date=September 7, 2018|last1=Bois|first1=Jon}}&lt;/ref&gt; Development renewed in May 2016, and the project solidified after SB Nation published its article "The Future of Football."&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.poynter.org/2017/this-sb-nation-story-has-everything-robots-football-and-2-3-million-pageviews/466041/|title=This SB Nation story has everything: Robots, football and 2.3 million pageviews|last=Funke|first=Daniel|date=July 10, 2017|website=|publisher=[[Poynter Institute]]|work=Poynter|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170904152053/https://www.poynter.org/news/sb-nation-story-has-everything-robots-football-and-23-million-pageviews|archive-date=September 4, 2017|dead-url=|access-date=September 7, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bois described it as the biggest project he ever attempted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite tweet|number=882763911510052864|user=jon_bois|title=today is day one of the biggest project i've ever tried. it is called 17776|author=|date=July 10, 2017|access-date=July 25, 2017|last=Bois|first=Jon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The series was developed by Graham MacAree, who used a Vox Media tool that creates custom packages from standard article sets to give Bois creative leeway and to accommodate the series' weight on the SB Nation website. MacAree found that there were few resources online for achieving the desired effects.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Themes ==
Bois has stated that he had "conceived [''17776''] to give the reader a good time," asserting that this "was literally the whole point."&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

William Hughes writing for ''[[The A.V. Club]]'' described ''17776'' as concerned with why humans play sports: "That is, given the massive resources, time, and information at our disposal (not to mention those available to our descendants), why does communal game-playing still hold such an important place in society?" He also listed consciousness, hope, and despair as among the work's themes.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.avclub.com/article/future-football-post-human-despair-and-fascinating-257765|title=The future of football is post-human despair (and fascinating sports meta-fiction)|last=Hughes|first=William|date=July 6, 2017|access-date=September 7, 2018|dead-url=|work=[[The A.V.

She also felt that Ten and Juice take on the [[Shoulder angel|role of angel and devil]], and she suggested the two may be [[Unreliable narrator|unreliable narrators]].&lt;ref name="io9"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://io9.gizmodo.com/sports-site-dives-into-scifi-with-series-about-the-futu-1796753325|title=Sports Site Dives Into Scifi with Series About the Future of Football|last=Elderkin|first=Beth|date=July 9, 2017|work=[[io9]]|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170917080645/http://io9.gizmodo.com/sports-site-dives-into-scifi-with-series-about-the-futu-1796753325|archivedate=September 17, 2017|accessdate=September 7, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ian Crouch of ''[[The New Yorker]]'' felt that the work had a "tonal echo" of [[Don DeLillo]]'s 1972 novel ''[[End Zone]]'' due to thematic similarities "with the way that the order and logic of football might act as a counterbalance to the chaos of the real world".&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

==Reception==
According to the communications director at Vox Media, ''17776'' garnered over 2.3 million pageviews by July 10.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Two days later it had received more than 2.9 million pageviews.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.newyorker.com/culture/rabbit-holes/the-experimental-fiction-that-imagines-football-obsessed-americans-in-the-extremely-distant-future|title=The Experimental Fiction That Imagines Football-Obsessed Americans in the Extremely Distant Future|last=Crouch|first=Ian|date=July 12, 2017|work=[[The New Yorker]]|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180613014956/https://www.newyorker.com/culture/rabbit-holes/the-experimental-fiction-that-imagines-football-obsessed-americans-in-the-extremely-distant-future|archive-date=June 13, 2018|dead-url=|access-date=September 7, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Average engagement time was over nine minutes, and 43 percent of readers finished each installment of the series published by July 7.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; On July 19, Bois claimed that ''17776''  received 700,000 [[unique visitors]] and 4 million total pageviews, with an average engagement time of 11 minutes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite tweet|number=887538023805669376|user=jon_bois|title=over the last two weeks, 17776 got four million pageviews and 700,000 unique visitors. people stuck around for an average of 11 minutes|author=|date=July 19, 2017|access-date=July 25, 2017|last=Bois|first=Jon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Thu-Huong Ha described ''17776'' as "part [[Italo Calvino]], part Peter Heller [author of ''[[The Dog Stars]]''], with humor seemingly from within the depths of [[Reddit]]," saying that the story would appeal to fans of both sports and literature.&lt;ref name=Quartz /&gt; [[Tor.com]] described the first chapter as full of tension and felt that receiving answers is a "surprisingly heartbreaking" experience "lessened by a gleeful bouncing immaturity" one would not expect from the characters.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.tor.com/2017/07/06/jon-bois-future-of-football-17776-story/|title=You Don't Know It Yet, But You're Reading a Hilarious Sci-Fi Short Story|last=|first=|authorlink=|date=July 6, 2017|website=On Our Radar|publisher=[[Tor.com]]|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170811010826/https://www.tor.com/2017/07/06/jon-bois-future-of-football-17776-story/|archive-date=August 11, 2017|dead-url=|access-date=September 7, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Beth Elderkin at ''io9'' said the series is "akin to ''[[Homestuck]]''" and described it as "weird, complex, and pretty spectacular".&lt;ref name="io9" /&gt; William Hughes writing for ''The A.V. Club'' felt that ''17776'' is a "truly innovative piece of work".&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; After reading the first three chapters, Agatha French of the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' stated that she was "impressed and excited by the innovation" of what she saw, and that she was intrigued despite not knowing what the work is or is saying. She felt the work took full advantage of its online medium and suggested that it "may also be a glimpse into the future of reading on the Internet".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.latimes.com/books/la-et-jc-litweek-20170712-htmlstory.html|title=Radiant children, the future of football and eau de literary hero|last=French|first=Agatha|date=July 12, 2017|work=[[Los Angeles Times]]|access-date=September 7, 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180202044237/http://www.latimes.com/books/la-et-jc-litweek-20170712-htmlstory.html|archive-date=February 2, 2018|dead-url=no|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ian Crouch of ''The New Yorker'' described the series as, "despite its seemingly meagre parts, a thing of startling beauty". Of the chapters published by July 12, he felt "the most striking chapter" to be one that utilized audio of [[Verne Lundquist]] calling [[Kick Six|the end of a 2013 game]] between the [[2013 Alabama Crimson Tide football team|University of Alabama]] and [[2013 Auburn Tigers football team|Auburn University]] over a video panning over Earth. He also noted that the series was compared to ''Homestuck'' and relayed additional comparisons to [[Thomas Pynchon]] novels and "a Reddit thread hijacked by robot [[Internet troll|trolls]]".&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

The series won a [[National Magazine Award]] for Digital Innovation from the [[American Society of Magazine Editors]] for the story and its delivery.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite tweet|number=973618290839912450|user=ASME1963|title=Ellies 2018: @SBNation wins Digital Innovation category for '17776: An American Football Story'|author=American Society of Magazine Editors|authorlink=American Society of Magazine Editors|date=March 13, 2018|access-date=July 17, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was also longlisted for the [[Hugo Award for Best Graphic Story]] in 2018, ultimately finishing in 11th place.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Adair |first1=Torsten |title=Hugo Awards, 2018: A Deeper Look Into the Nominations and Voting Data |url=http://www.comicsbeat.com/hugo-awards-2018-a-deeper-look-into-the-nominations-and-voting-data/ |work=[[Comics Beat|The Beat]] |date=September 2, 2018|accessdate=October 3, 2018|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180904184049/http://www.comicsbeat.com/hugo-awards-2018-a-deeper-look-into-the-nominations-and-voting-data/|archivedate=September 4, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Social sculpture and political art==

Local and nationally known artists were commissioned to create socio-political artwork presented through the mass media, concerning critical issues of the time, such as [[nuclear proliferation]], [[environmental degradation]], [[human rights]], [[animal rights]], and loss of privacy through technology. The forum stimulated discourse between local communities and nationally known artists through hands-on video workshops, interviews, lectures, performances, informal discussions and [[road trips]].&lt;ref name="Albuquerque Journal Magazine"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Walton|first=Marcus|title='Art and the Media: An art project adopts techniques of the mass media'|journal=Albuquerque Journal Magazine, Impact|date=January 28, 1986|volume= 9| issue = 15}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It was sponsored by the [[National Endowment for the Arts]], Albuquerque Arts Alliance, the Santa Fe Center for Contemporary Art, and the New Mexico Arts Division.&lt;ref name="Albuquerque Living Magazine"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Clancy|first=Patrick|author2=Widmer, Gwenn|title='Front Pages, Frontier Living: Disappearing Space (Even in the West)'|journal=Albuquerque Living Magazine|date=January 1986}}&lt;/ref&gt;  ART/MEDIA operated as a ''museum without walls'' with an office located in the historical [[Kimo Theater]] on [[U.S. Route 66|Route 66]].&lt;ref name="Albuquerque Living Magazine"/&gt; Inspired by the concept/model of [[Joseph Beuys]] [[social sculpture]], that have the potential to transform society, ART/MEDIA was an extended artwork that included human interactions, creating structures and systems within society using language, thought, objects, events and actions.&lt;ref name="The Santa Fe Reporter"&gt;{{cite news|title='Beyond the Andrews (on Paul Bob)'|newspaper=The Santa Fe Reporter|date=February 12, 1986}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The project was documented by seminal video artists [[Steina and Woody Vasulka]] who founded [[The Kitchen]] in [[New York City]] in 1971.&lt;ref name="City Arts"&gt;{{cite journal|title='ART/MEDIA Funded by National Endowment for the Arts and New Mexico Arts Division'|journal=City Arts|date=November–December 1985}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

The concept for the project originated in 1984 with artists Duane Griffin, Patrick Clancy and Scott Portman who later joined with Co-Directors [[Eve Andree Laramee]] and Ann Zimmerman to found the project and organization. The [[Santa Fe Center for Contemporary Arts]] was the fiscal sponsor under 501c3 not-for-profit status. Bob Gaylor, then director of SFCCC and invited Griffin and Laramee to be part of a [[Think Tank]] at [[St. John's College (Annapolis/Santa Fe)|St. John's College]] where they met with [[Steina and Woody Vasulka]], [[Allan Kaprow]], [[Carolee Schneemann]], [[Edward "Ned" Hall]], [[Jerome Rothenberg]], and other artists and thinkers. Empowered by this experience, a team of advisors were assembled. Gaylor served as a primary advisor throughout the project, along with Gordon Church of the City of Albuquerque Cultural Affairs Office. The Albuquerque Arts Alliance and the City of [[Albuquerque]] became the second fiscal sponsor, providing an office in the historical [[Kimo Theater]] on [[U.S. Route 66|Route 66]]. [[Steina and Woody Vasulka]] introduced the organizers to [[Godfrey Reggio]], director of the film [[Koyannisqatsi]] (1982) who provided guidance on organizing [[Social Sculpture]] events as ''[[public service announcements]]''.  Reggio, having been involved in numerous progressive political causes, took interest because his Institute for Regional Education had developed a multi-media campaign of PSA's for the [[American Civil Liberties Union]] on the invasion of privacy and use of technology to control behavior in 1972. Grants were received from the [[National Endowment for the Arts]] in the InterArts and the Artist Forums categories and the New Mexico Arts Division.

The title card of ''A Short Vision''.
]]
'''''A Short Vision''''' is a British animated film by Joan and [[Peter Foldes]] released in 1956. The film, inspired by one of Peter's poems, depicts the destruction of mankind. The film's music was composed by [[Matyas Seiber]], who composed music for ''[[Animal Farm (1954 film)|Animal Farm]]'' two years earlier.

''A Short Vision'' gained notoriety when it was shown on ''[[The Ed Sullivan Show]]'' on 25 May 1956. This, however, made it controversial. Due to popular demand, it was shown again on 10 June.

==Origins==
''A Short Vision'' was inspired by a poem composed by Peter Foldes&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://conelrad.blogspot.co.uk/2011/06/short-vision-ed-sullivans-atomic-show.html|title=A SHORT VISION: Ed Sullivan’s Atomic Show Stopper|website=conelrad.blogspot.co.uk|access-date=2018-02-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; while on a boat from Australia in October 1954. Peter was creative artist for the film,&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; while his wife Joan was responsible for the [[animation stand]], the lighting and some of the animation.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The film was produced in the Foldes' kitchen.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; and was funded by the [[British Film Institute|British Film Institute's Experimental Film Fund]].&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Citation|last=BFI|title=A Short Vision (1956) {{!}} BFI National Archive|date=2009-05-19|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BkhNED3-mnI|accessdate=2018-02-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; The scheme also funded an earlier Foldes' animation entitled ''Animated Genesis'' about a society which is under threat from a tyrant.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==Synopsis==
[[File:It itself, from A Short Vision.png|thumb|upright 1.17|''It'', itself.]]
The film opens with a shot from a bedroom window. It pans to the sky as the narrator (James McKechnie) recalls the time he looked out his window. He saw an object flying through the sky. Throughout the film the object is only referred to as ''It''. Although ''It'' was very far away and seemed to move slowly, it came swiftly and was unnoticed. When ''It'' flew over the mountain, the leopard and the deer looked up. When they saw ''It,'' the deer ran free from the leopard's claws and they both hide in fear. When ''It'' flew over the fields, the owl and the rat looked up, and the rat ran free of the owl's claws and they both hide in fear.

When ''It'' flew over the city, everyone was asleep except for their leaders and their wise men, who all looked up at ''It,'' but it was too late. ''It'' produces a mushroom cloud engulfing the city, killing and destroying the wise men, the leaders, the owl, the leopard, the rat and the deer. ''It'' also destroys the sleeping people. ''It'' then engulfs the mountain and the fields; destroying them. When it was all over, there was nothing left except a tiny flame. Then the narrator sees ''It'' flying around the flame like a moth, and then ''It'' too is destroyed. And then, the flame died.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

==''The Ed Sullivan Show''==
[[File:The mushroom cloud produced by It ; from A Short Vision.png|thumb|upright 1.17|The mushroom cloud produced by ''It.'']][[Ed Sullivan]] was originally in England when he saw ''A Short Vision''&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; and promised an American showing.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Sullivan said his motive was a "plea for peace".&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; However, he may have shown it because of his relationship with George K. Arthur, the person who sold ''A Short Vision'' for the television and as well as cinemas.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; 10 days after he saw it&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; on 27 May 1956, [[Ed Sullivan]] showed ''A Short Vision'' on his popular Sunday night show ''[[The Ed Sullivan Show]].''&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; In the first screening Sullivan told the audience to tell their children in the room to not be alarmed, because of its animated nature.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Nevertheless, the film was controversial{{By whom|date=May 2018}}; hence, its popularity. Due to its popularity the film was shown again on 10 June. However, before showing it, Sullivan told parents to take children out of the room.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Sullivan was incorrect{{By whom|date=May 2018}} when he first said ''A Short Vision'' depicted the effects of a [[H-Bomb]] on an "animal population".&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The film actually depicts the effects of a H-Bomb on humans and animals; not just animals.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; This leads some to believe{{Who|date=May 2018}} that he did not watch the entirety of ''A Short Vision'' before airing it on his show.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The Big Lobster was opened on 15 December 1979 after six months of construction.

== History ==

The ''Big Lobster'' was originally conceived by Ian Backler. A local [[Lobster fishing|lobster fisherman]], he formulated a plan to build a [[Visitor center|visitor centre]] in Kingston SE while travelling in the [[United States]]. Upon returning to Australia he formed a partnership with Rob Moyse, and they engaged Ian Hannaford to develop the complex on a vacant block of land.&lt;ref name="Clark2004p181"&gt;{{Harvnb|Clark|2004|p=181}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The ''Big Lobster'' was envisioned by the developers as a means of attracting attention to the centre, and initially the lobster was intended to "rear up" over the front of the complex. Unfortunately, the plans changed when [[Kingston District Council|local council]] regulations forced the lobster to be repositioned in front of the visitor centre. Paul Kelly, who had previously built the Big Scotsman in [[North Adelaide, South Australia|North Adelaide]], was employed to design and build the new structure. Kelly built the lobster in [[Edwardstown, South Australia]], and the final product was transported by road to the site, where it was opened by the [[Premiers of South Australia|South Australian Premier]] [[David Tonkin]] on 15 December 1979.&lt;ref name="Clark2004p181-182"&gt;{{Harvnb|Clark|2004|pp=181–182}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Ian Backler and Rob Moyse ran the site for 15 years until selling it in 1984.&lt;ref name="Clark2004p183"&gt;{{Harvnb|Clark|2004|p=183}}&lt;/ref&gt; The new owners operated the complex until 1990, when it was sold to Eric and Kath Peltz.&lt;ref name="ForSale2001"&gt;{{Harvnb|"Big Lobster yours for $690,000"|2 October 2001|p=12}}&lt;/ref&gt; The current owners, Jenna Lawrie and Casey Sharpe, purchased the property from the Peltz' in 2007 after it had been on the market for six years.&lt;ref name="ForSale2001" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Jenkin20071114"&gt;{{Harvnb|Jenkin|14 November 2007|p=35}}&lt;/ref&gt; They then renovated the site, making changes to the complex as well as steam cleaning the lobster, and formed plans to repaint "Larry" (as the lobster is locally known) as part of the process.&lt;ref name="Jenkin20071114" /&gt;

Radio duo [[Hamish &amp; Andy|Hamish and Andy]] launched the charity campaign #PinchAMate&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.hamishandandy.com/2016/save-larry/|title=Save Larry! {{!}} Hamish &amp; Andy|last=Andy|first=Hamish &amp;|website=www.hamishandandy.com|access-date=2016-04-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; in early 2016 after a local man contacted the show with concern that, due to the Lobster's weathered condition, it would not survive the winter. The show started to raise awareness and collect funds for the Australian icon. However, the donations were lost after the duo bet on a horse race that they believed they had a "100% chance of winning". The Kingston's icon was somehow restored to its original beauty.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation needed|date=November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Design and construction ==

The ''Big Lobster'' is 17 metres high, 15.2 metres long and is 13.7 metres wide, with an approximate weight of 4 tonnes.&lt;ref name="Clark2004p181" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Scutt2009p93"&gt;{{Harvnb|Scutt|2009|p=93}}&lt;/ref&gt; The designer, Paul Kelly, modelled the structure on a lobster that he purchased and had [[Taxidermy|stuffed]] for the purpose, and built it at warehouse out of a steel frame with a fibreglass shell. The details were carved out of foam prior to the application of the fibreglass, before transporting it and having it reassembled on site. The process took approximately six months.&lt;ref name="Clark2004p182"&gt;{{Harvnb|Clark|2004|p=182}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The visitor complex at which it was sited originally consisted of a restaurant, tourist area and a small theatrette.&lt;ref name="Clark2004p183" /&gt; Under the current management the restaurant has been altered to provide a more open-plan space, and it now incorporates the restaurant and a wine tasting area, with plans having been formulated to add accommodation and an accredited tourist centre to the venue.&lt;ref name="Jenkin20071114" /&gt;

[[File:CaricaturePB.jpg|right|thumb|Cover of the 2002 paperback edition of ''Caricature'']]
'''''Caricature''''' is a book collection of nine [[Comics|comic]] [[Short story|short stories]] by [[Daniel Clowes]]. In contrast to earlier Clowes collections such as ''Lout Rampage!'' and ''Orgy Bound'', ''Caricature'' concentrates on the more naturalistic, character-focused side of Clowes's output displayed in ''[[Ghost World]]''. It includes some of his most admired short stories, including "Immortal, Invisible", "Gynecology" and the title story. All the material in the collection originally appeared in Clowes's [[comic book]] ''[[Eightball (comic book)|Eightball]]'' with the exception of "Green Eyeliner", which was published in ''[[Esquire (magazine)|Esquire]]''.

''Caricature'' was first published by [[Fantagraphics Books]] in 1998 in a deluxe [[hardcover]] edition. A less expensive [[paperback]] version was released in 2002. Both editions contain a mixture of [[Color printing|full-color]] and [[black-and-white]] material.

'''''Carnal Knowledge''''' is a 1971 American [[comedy-drama]] film directed by [[Mike Nichols]] and written by [[Jules Feiffer]]. It stars [[Jack Nicholson]], [[Art Garfunkel]], [[Ann-Margret]], and [[Candice Bergen]].

==Plot==
The story follows the sexual exploits of two [[Amherst College]] [[roommate]]s over a 25-year period, from the late 1940s to the early 1970s. Sandy (Art Garfunkel) is gentle and passive, while Jonathan Fuerst (Jack Nicholson) is tough and aggressive. Sandy idolizes women, Jonathan objectifies women. He frequently uses the term "ballbuster" to describe women as emasculating teases whose main pleasure is to deny pleasure to men; he extends this term to mean women who want to get married instead of accepting that men mostly want unattached sex. Since each man's perspective of womanhood is extreme and self-serving, neither is able to sustain a relationship with a woman.

The film has three parts. Part I occurs when Sandy and Jonathan are college roommates. Part II follows the men several years after college. In the final part, the men have become middle-aged.

In the beginning, Sandy and Jonathan are discussing women, and what kind appeals to each. Sandy wants a woman who is intellectual. Jonathan is more interested in a woman's physical attributes. 

Sandy shyly meets Susan (Candice Bergen) at an on-campus event and they begin dating. Although they enjoy each other's company, Susan is reluctant to enter into a physical relationship. Unknown to Sandy, she is pursued by Jonathan, who feels a physical attraction for her. They have sex. Jonathan tries to convince Susan not to have sex with Sandy, but after some delays, Susan is also having sex with Sandy. Part I ends with Susan and Jonathan breaking up.

Part II finds Sandy married to Susan, while Jonathan is still searching for his "perfect woman". Jonathan now defines perfection by a woman's bust size and figure. Jonathan begins a relationship with Bobbie (Ann-Margret), a beautiful woman who fulfills all of Jonathan's physical requirements. However, Jonathan constantly berates Bobbie for being shallow. Jonathan finds that this purely physical relationship is no more satisfying than his previous relationship with Susan. Bobbie leaves her job at Jonathan's suggestion. She then becomes depressed, sleeping long hours doing nothing but sleeping in the apartment she shares with Jonathan. The relationship deteriorates. Jonathan berates Bobbie for not cleaning up the apartment while he is out working a nine-to-five job all day. He claims that he doesn't understand why breakups always have to end with "poison."

Sandy's relationship with Susan is faring no better. Sandy is dissatisfied and bored with the physical part of their relationship, even though he and Susan "do all the right things." He relates how they are "patient with each other" and concludes with a statement that perhaps sex is not "meant to be enjoyable with a person you love". He says that being in bed with Susan as she tells him what to do is like taking orders on a short order drill.
 
Sandy and Susan end their relationship. He begins dating Cindy (Cynthia O'Neal) next. Sandy, Cindy, Jonathan and Bobbie find themselves together at Jonathan's apartment, where Jonathan suggests privately to Sandy that they trade partners, to "liven things up a bit." Sandy goes to the bedroom looking for Bobbie. Cindy dances with Jonathan and reprimands him for attempting to bed her with Sandy nearby, but indicates she is open to seeing him on his own, saying he should contact her at a more appropriate time. In the meantime, upset by an earlier fight with Jonathan about her desire to get married, Bobbie has attempted suicide. She is found by Sandy, who rings the hospital to have her taken to intensive care.

Part III opens with now-middleaged Jonathan presenting a slideshow entitled "Ballbusters on Parade" to Sandy (now in his 40s) and his 18-year-old girlfriend, Jennifer ([[Carol Kane]]). The slideshow consists of pictures of Jonathan's various loves throughout his life. He skips awkwardly over a slide of Susan, but not before Sandy notices. He also shows an image of Bobbie, saying they are divorced and had one child together, and he is paying her alimony. Jennifer leaves in tears. Sandy idolizes his new lover, explaining that "she knows worlds which I cannot begin to touch yet." Jonathan believes his friend is deluding himself.

Time passes. Jonathan remains successful, but is alone. A prostitute ([[Rita Moreno]]) is with him, and they go through a ritual dialogue about male/female relationships which is apparently a script written by Jonathan. At the end, the prostitute recites a monologue (again scripted by Jonathan) praising his power and "perfection," which apparently has become the only way Jonathan can now get an erection.

==Cast==
* [[Jack Nicholson]] as Jonathan Fuerst
* [[Art Garfunkel|Arthur Garfunkel]] as Sandy
* [[Candice Bergen]] as Susan
* [[Ann-Margret]] as Bobbie
* [[Rita Moreno]] as Louise
* [[Carol Kane]] as Jennifer
* Cynthia O'Neal as Cindy

==Production==
The script was originally written as a play. Jules Feiffer sent it to Mike Nichols, who thought it would work better as a film.&lt;ref&gt;Nichols Meets Jules Feiffer: Mike Nichols &lt;/ref&gt;  The script contains numerous four-letter words, some of which were rarely heard on the screen before this time.

==Legal problems==
The changes in the morals of American society of the 1960s and 1970s and the general receptiveness by the public to frank discussion of sexual issues was sometimes at odds with local community standards. A theatre in [[Albany, Georgia]], showed the film. On January 13, 1972, the local police served a search warrant on the theatre, and seized the film. In March 1972, the theatre manager, Mr. Jenkins, was convicted of the crime of "distributing obscene material". His conviction was upheld by the [[Supreme Court of Georgia (U.S. state)|Supreme Court of Georgia]]. On June 24, 1974, the [[U.S. Supreme Court]] found that the State of Georgia had gone too far in classifying material as obscene in view of its prior decision in ''[[Miller v. California]]'', {{ussc|413|15|1973}} (the ''Miller'' standard), and overturned the conviction&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://explore.lib.virginia.edu/exhibits/show/censored/walkthrough/film2|title=University of Virginia Library Online Exhibits - CENSORED: Wielding the Red Pen|website=explore.lib.virginia.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt; in ''[[Jenkins v. Georgia]]'', {{ussc|418|153|1974}}. The court also said that, {{quote|Our own viewing of the film satisfies us that ''Carnal Knowledge'' could not be found … to depict sexual conduct in a patently offensive way. Nothing in the movie falls within … material which may constitutionally be found … "patently offensive" … While the subject matter of the picture is, in a broader sense, sex, and there are scenes in which sexual conduct including "ultimate sexual acts" is to be understood to be taking place, the camera does not focus on the bodies of the actors at such times. There is no exhibition whatever of the actors' genitals, lewd or otherwise, during these scenes. There are occasional scenes of nudity, but nudity alone is not enough to make material legally obscene… Appellant's showing of the film ''Carnal Knowledge'' is simply not the "public portrayal of hard core sexual conduct for its own sake, and for the ensuing commercial gain" which we said was punishable…}}

==Reception==
===Critical response===
[[Rotten Tomatoes]] retrospectively gave the film a score of 86% based on reviews from 28 critics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/carnal_knowledge/|title=Carnal Knowledge|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Accolades===
{{Anchor|Awards|Accolades}}
''Carnal Knowledge'' was nominated for [[Golden Globe Award for Best Actor – Motion Picture Drama]] (Jack Nicholson), [[Golden Globe Award for Best Supporting Actor – Motion Picture]] (Art Garfunkel), and [[Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress]] (Ann-Margret).

==In popular culture==
* A 1971 ''[[All in the Family]]'' episode "Gloria Poses in the Nude" has Archie and Edith coming home after watching the film. Edith thought it was a religious film because she thought the title of the film was ''Cardinal Knowledge'' until Archie corrects her. 
* The 1992 ''[[The Wonder Years]]'' episode "Carnal Knowledge" has Kevin Arnold and his friends attempting to sneak in to see the film despite being underage.
* In the 1992 ''[[Seinfeld]]'' episode "[[The Trip (Seinfeld)|The Trip]]", [[George Costanza]] and [[Jerry Seinfeld (character)|Jerry Seinfeld]] ponder whether Candice Bergen showed her breasts in the film.
* The 1993 animated series ''[[Rocko's Modern Life]]'' has an episode titled "Carnival Knowledge" which is a [[pun]] on the movies title, although the episode itself has very little to do with the film.

'''Charlotte Shakespeare''' was a professional, non-profit theatre company in [[Charlotte, North Carolina]].  The company specialized in intimate and accessible performances of traditional and modern classics, with an emphasis on the plays of [[William Shakespeare]] and with a mission of presenting plays "that reflect timeless truths about the human condition and honor Shakespeare’s genius for storytelling and language".

==History==
The company was founded by Elise Wilkinson and Joe Copley in 2006 under the name Collaborative Arts Theatre.  It was granted status as a 501(c)(3) non-profit organization in 2008. The name was changed to Charlotte Shakespeare in 2012.&lt;ref&gt;[http://patrickschneider.photoshelter.com/gallery/-/G0000gge.DZPy9rk/ Charlotte Shakespeare Festival on the Green in Uptown]&lt;/ref&gt;  Charlotte Shakespeare has never had a performance venue of its own.  In its first two years productions took place in a tavern, in a series of apartments, and on the Green.  Since that time all plays have been produced in theaters at [[North Carolina Blumenthal Performing Arts Center#Theaters|Spirit Square]] or on [[The Green (Charlotte, North Carolina)|The Green]]. The company went on hiatus in the summer of 2015 and has not reopened.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.charlotteobserver.com/entertainment/article25767040.html Charlotte Shakespeare cancels summer season] By Lawrence Toppman, [[Charlotte Observer]] June 29, 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

==Charlotte Shakespeare Festival==
Each summer Charlotte Shakespeare produced the Charlotte Shakespeare Festival which began in June with a show presented outdoors on [[The Green (Charlotte, North Carolina)|The Green]], an uptown pocket park.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.carolinasmalltownliving.com/blogs/carol_fox/archive/2012/06/04/fun-things-to-do-in-charlotte-nc-shakespeare-at-the-green.aspx CarolinaSmallTownLiving!  ''Fun Things to Do in Charlotte NC--Shakespeare at The Green'']&lt;/ref&gt;   ''Charlotte'' Magazine described the annual return of Shakespeare on the Green as, "one of the best cultural gifts Charlotte will get all year".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.charlottemagazine.com/Blogs/Revue/May-2012/Free-Bard/ Director Matt Cosper talks about Shakespeare's "The Tempest"]&lt;/ref&gt; Admission was free and the company depended on voluntary donations.  A second show was presented in August at [[North Carolina Blumenthal Performing Arts Center#Theaters|Spirit Square]].  Most productions were from the Shakespeare canon, but an exception was made in 2011 when the outdoor summer play was [[Tartuffe]] by [[Moliere]].

''[[Video Green]]'', Kraus' first non-fiction book examines the explosion of late 1990s art by high-profile graduate programs that catapulted [[Los Angeles]] into the center of the international art world.{{whom|date=September 2017}} Her films include ''Gravity &amp; Grace'', ''How To Shoot A Crime'', and ''The Golden Bowl, or, Repression''.

== Biography ==
Kraus was born in [[New York City]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://culturalicons.co.nz/episode/chris-kraus "Conversations with iconic people – Chris Kraus".] culturalicons.co.nz. Retrieved 27 May 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; and spent her childhood in Connecticut and New Zealand. After obtaining a BA at a young age from [[Victoria University of Wellington]], [[New Zealand]], Kraus worked as a journalist for five years, and then moved to [[New York City]]. Kraus was aged 21 when she arrived in New York and began studying with actor [[Ruth Maleczech]] and director [[Lee Breuer]], whose studio in the East Village was called ReCherChez.&lt;ref&gt;Guthrie, Kayla. "[http://www.artinamericamagazine.com/news-features/interviews/chris-kraus-real-fine-arts/ Interview: Performing Is Storytelling: Q+A with Chris Kraus]." ''Art in America''. 2011 June 22.&lt;/ref&gt; 
Kraus made films and [[video art]] and staged performances and plays at many venues. In the late 1970s she was a member of [[The Artists Project]], a City-funded public service venture of painters, poets, writers, filmmakers and dancers.

Her work as a performance and video artist satirized the Downtown scene's gender politics and favored literary tropes, blending theatrical techniques with [[Dada]], literary criticism, social activism, and [[performance art]].

Kraus is Jewish and deals with many spiritual and social aspects of Judaism in her works. She says that her parents attended Christian church and did not tell her that her family is Jewish until she moved back to Manhattan at age 21, possibly to shield her from antisemitism.&lt;ref name="k-word"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Sonkin|first1=Rebecca|title=Chris Kraus and the K-Word|url=https://lareviewofbooks.org/article/chris-kraus-k-word/|accessdate=17 May 2017|work=Los Angeles Review of Books|date=5 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="tablet" /&gt;

She continued to make films through the mid-1990s. As of 2006 she was married to [[Sylvère Lotringer]], a Jewish man who survived the [[Holocaust]] as a child,&lt;ref name="tablet"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Cahmi|first1=Leslie|title=The Tense of Trauma - Novelist Chris Kraus ponders the meaning of “It would have been”|url=http://www.tabletmag.com/jewish-arts-and-culture/books/864/the-tense-of-trauma|website=Tablet Magazine|accessdate=17 May 2017|date=7 June 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; but they had divorced by 2016.&lt;ref name="k-word" /&gt; Some of her works are based on her marriage and her ex-husband.&lt;ref name="k-word" /&gt;&lt;ref name="tablet" /&gt; She now lives in [[Los Angeles]].

In 2017, Kraus published ''After Kathy Acker'', a biography of [[Kathy Acker]].&lt;ref name="Guardian 31 August 2017"&gt;{{cite news |last= Laing |first= Olivia | authorlink= Olivia Laing| title= After Kathy Acker by Chris Kraus review – sex, art and a life of myths |url= https://www.theguardian.com/books/2017/aug/31/after-kathy-acker-by-chris-kraus-review| date= 31 August 2017| newspaper= [[The Guardian]] |location=London| accessdate=6 September 2017  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Works==
===I Love Dick===

''[[I Love Dick]]'' is an [[epistolary novel]], a series of love letters to an elusive addressee, later identified as [[Dick Hebdige]]. In an introduction to the second edition of the novel, [[Eileen Myles]] writes, "Chris' ultimate achievement is philosophical.  She's turned female [[Social rejection|abjection]] inside out and aimed it at a man.  As if her decades of experience were both a painting and a weapon.  As if she, a hag, a jew, a poet, a failed filmmaker, a former go-go dancer—an intellectual, a wife, as if she had the right to go right up to the end of the book and ''live'' having felt all that.  ''I Love Dick'' boldly suggests that Chris Kraus' unswervingly attempted and felt female life is a total work ''and'' it didn't kill her." &lt;ref&gt;New York Magazine - 17 November 1997 - Page 20 "But this first literary effort by Chris Kraus, an alternative filmmaker who is also a fiction editor at Semiotext(e), got the wrong kind of attention. Her confessional roman a clef about the mossy realm of academe and the glossy SoHo-Chelsea art scene nearly landed her in court."&lt;/ref&gt; In  2016, [[Jill Soloway]] adapted the novel as a [[I_Love_Dick_(TV_series)|TV series]], produced by [[Amazon Studios]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| url = https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2016/feb/18/i-love-dick-amazon-produced-by-jill-soloway-creator-transparent| title = Coming from the creator of Transparent: I Love Dick, the TV version of cult novel| last = Gajanan| first = Mahita| date = 2016-02-18| newspaper = The Guardian| language = en-GB| issn = 0261-3077| access-date = 2016-02-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first season was released on May 12, 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url = http://www.metacritic.com/tv/i-love-dick/critic-reviews| title = ''I Love Dick'' critic reviews| date = May 24, 2017| accessdate = 2017-05-24| publisher = metacritic.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Aliens and Anorexia===
''Aliens and Anorexia'' jumps back and forth in time and location, tracing the life and activism of [[Ulrike Meinhof]], the downtown theatre scene in late seventies New York, the drug experiments of [[Aldous Huxley]], the paintings and writings of [[Paul Thek]], through the narrator Chris's fruitless attempts to make and sell a feature film, "Gravity and Grace", (which takes its title from the [[Simone Weil]] volume of the same name).

===Video Green===
A series of 23 essays written between 1998 and 2003, mostly in her column "Torpor" in the magazine Artext, ''Video Green'' is dense with the literary, the personal, and the culturally marginal.  A few of the collection's notable essays ''not'' about L.A. include the elegiac "Posthumous Lives", about the performance artist Penny Arcade's loving curation of the estate of the filmmaker Jack Smith, and "How to Shoot a Crime," about Kraus's 1987 film of the same name.  The volume's first essay and its lengthiest, "Art Collection" follows the idea of collecting through L.A.'s M.F.A. art scene and real estate market, ending up in rural upstate New York with the extraordinary poetry—and art collection—of the all-but forgotten William Bronk.

===Torpor===
''Torpor'' follows Jerome Shafir, a literature professor at Columbia, his wife, Sylvie Green, a writer and filmmaker with an inconclusive career, and their dog Lily through rustbelt [[New York City]], Paris, Berlin, and the [[Eastern Bloc]] at the dawn of the New World Order.  As much a shattering portrait of a Holocaust survivor as portrait of a marriage, ''Torpor'' is also the portrait of a lady rarely found in literature: a down-and-out intellectual bearing witness to a culture in collapse{{According to whom|date=March 2018}}. In ''Torpor'', Kraus shifts out of the first-person narration of ''[[I Love Dick]]'', employing a kind of free-indirect discourse.  In naming her central characters Sylvie and Jerome, Kraus alludes to the hapless, interchangeable protagonists of [[George Perec]]'s first novel, ''Les Choses''.  Perec, a childhood friend of both ''Torpor'''s Jerome and Kraus's real-life husband, [[Sylvère Lotringer]], is quoted several times in the novel.  [[Felix Guattari]] and [[Nan Goldin]] also make appearances, among other cultural figures, though Kraus's use of "reality" comes to more subversive effect than a simple ''roman à clef''.

===Summer of Hate===
''Summer of Hate'' is the story of Catt Dunlop who, like Kraus, is an art critic and occasional professor of Cultural Studies. Emerging rattled from a dangerous relationship with a dominant sex partner she met online, Catt invests in a handful of corroding properties in [[Albuquerque]] and moves there to prepare them for rental. She hires Paul Garcia to work as her property manager, and they begin a romantic relationship, though Catt is still married to an older philosopher in [[New York City]]. A recovering alcoholic, Paul is on parole after spending two years in prison for “stealing less than an art gallery spends on an after-party.” Eventually Paul is pulled over for speeding and arrested in fulfillment of an outstanding warrant, and the pair embarks on a grueling legal process involving inhumane prison practices and impossible parole stipulations. Back in [[Los Angeles]] Catt studies and teaches “all the books about symbolic violence, soft forms of control,” but the forms of control to which Paul is subject are neither soft nor symbolic. As the course of her life fuses with the course of Paul’s, Catt's relationship to class, race, citizenship and criminality become increasingly complicated, forming the basis of Kraus' novelistic critique.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.full-stop.net/2012/09/04/reviews/meagan-day/summer-of-hate-chris-kraus/ "Summer of Hate"] reviewed at ''Full Stop''. 4 September 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

===After Kathy Acker===
''After Kathy Acker'' is a biography of [[Kathy Acker]], a radical American experimental novelist, poet, and essayist. Writing in the ''[[Financial_Times|FT]]'', Lauren Elkin wrote that Kraus "is the perfect mediator for Acker, finding in her work an aesthetics of provocation, discomfiture, risk and radical empathy." Reviewing the book for ''[[The Guardian]]'', [[Olivia Laing]] noted, "Acker was the previous girlfriend of Kraus's now ex-husband, Sylvère Lotringer, like Kraus an editor at the independent publisher Semiotext(e) and a frequent interlocutor here. Is it crass to point this out? It certainly complicates any objective perspective, and maybe it would have been better to state it plainly, especially since it's logged in ''I Love Dick'', the roman-à-clef that made Kraus famous. That said, Kraus reconstitutes Acker's wanderings with real wit and beauty, understanding without pandering to the painfully high stakes of her identity games."&lt;ref name="Guardian 31 August 2017"/&gt;

==Semiotext(e) Native Agents Series==
[[Sylvère Lotringer]], Kraus's husband from the late eighties to the late nineties, founded [[Semiotexte]]'s Foreign Agents series, which mostly published French critical theorists, in 1980. Ten years later Kraus founded the press's Native Agents imprint to publish fiction, mostly by women, as an analogue to the French theories of subjectivity in the Foreign Agents series.&lt;ref name="nplusonemag.com"&gt;"Female Trouble," Elizabeth Gumport, n+1 Magazine, 14 February 2012 http://nplusonemag.com/female-trouble&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to groundbreaking works of fiction by writers like [[Michelle Tea]] and [[Ann Rower]], Native Agents has published notable volumes of poetry and prose by [[Eileen Myles]], [[Barbara Barg]], and [[Fanny Howe]], as well as memoirs and interviews by [[Kathy Acker]], [[Bob Flanagan]], David Rattray, and [[William Burroughs]]. In a 2012 piece for ''[[n+1]]'', senior editor Elizabeth Gumport wrote "What united the Native Agents authors was the way their work combined elements of theory, fiction, and biography, explicitly refusing to identify absolutely with any single genre."&lt;ref name="nplusonemag.com"/&gt;

==Films==
Before beginning her career as writer, Kraus was an artist and filmmaker, making a number of short films and videos, including one feature ''Gravity &amp; Grace''. Her films have been the focus of a number of international retrospective exhibitions and screenings, beginning in 2008 with “Plastic is Leather, Fuck You: Film and Video 1983-1993” at Galerie Cinzia Friedlaender, Berlin. In the press release for the 2011 exhibition at Real Fine Arts in [[Brooklyn]], Kraus detailed her thoughts behind the production of these films.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite press release|title=Press release for "Chris Kraus ''Films''"|publisher=Real Fine Arts|location=Brooklyn, New York|url=http://realfinearts.com/files/gimgs/35_ck.jpg}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The Chance Event==
The Chance Event: Three Days in the Desert: Primm, Nevada, November 1996.  Curated by Chris Kraus, Chance brought together [[Jean Baudrillard]], [[Sandy Stone (artist)|Rosanne Alluquere Stone]], [[DJ Spooky]], Diane di Prima, the Moapa Band of Paiute Indians, visual artists, garage noise bands and 600 participants to investigate the mystery of chance at Whiskey Pete's Casino.  Variously described as "a philosophy rave" and "one of the landmark LA events of the 90s," The Chance Event was reviewed on the front page of [[the LA Times]] and throughout the art press.  Highlights, including a performance by Baudrillard wearing a gold Elvis-inspired blazer and accompanied by the 'Chance' band, were broadcast on European television. The event was funded by the French Cultural Service and Art Center College of Design.

==Influence==
Though best known in the art world for much of her career, Kraus's readership is beginning to increase.&lt;ref&gt;"The Novelist as Performance Artist," Michael M. Miller, Gallerist, 30 October 2012 http://galleristny.com/2012/10/the-novelist-as-performance-artist-on-chris-kraus-the-art-worlds-favorite-fiction-writer/&lt;/ref&gt; She's been referenced in the work of poet [[Ariana Reines]], novelist and memoirist [[Kate Zambreno]], and [[n+1]]'s pamphlet No Regrets.&lt;ref&gt;No Regrets, n+1 http://shop.nplusonemag.com/products/no-regrets&lt;/ref&gt;

In an introduction to her September 2013 interview with Kraus in [[The Believer (magazine)|The Believer]], author [[Sheila Heti]] wrote "I know there was a time before I read Chris Kraus’s ''I Love Dick'' (in fact, that time was only five years ago), but it’s hard to imagine; some works of art do this to you. They tear down so many assumptions about what the form can handle (in this case, what the form of the novel can handle) that there is no way to re-create your mind before your encounter with them."&lt;ref&gt;"Interview with Chris Kraus,' Sheila Heti, The Believer, September 2013 http://www.believermag.com/issues/201309/?read=interview_kraus&lt;/ref&gt;

==Awards==
In 2008, Kraus received the [[Frank Jewett Mather]] Award for Art Criticism from the [[College Art Association]].&lt;ref name="caa"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.collegeart.org/awards/matherpast|title=Awards|publisher=The College Art Association|accessdate=11 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Clive Blackmore Barda''' [[OBE]], [[List of Fellows of the Royal Society of Arts|FRSA]] (born 14 January 1945) is a British freelance photographer best known for capturing the performances of classical musicians and artists of the stage (opera, ballet and theatre). During his career spanning over five decades, Barda has created a collection of over a million photographs of performers, composers, and conductors.
{{TOClimit|2}}

==Early life==
Barda was born in 1945 and spent his early childhood in [[Alexandria]], Egypt, where his father was a lawyer and his mother a painter. The family returned to England in 1956.&lt;ref name="CBEfE1979"&gt;Exhibition leaflet for ''An Eye for an Ear''. Royal Festival Hall, London (1 March &amp;ndash; 8 April 1979).&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|4}} Barda attended [[Bryanston School]] and graduated from [[Birkbeck College, University of London]] ([[Bachelor of Arts|BA Hons]] Modern Langs),&lt;ref name="CBTimes2004"&gt;{{cite web |title= Artists and photographers |url= http://www.thetimes.co.uk/tto/news/uk/article1954865.ece |publisher= The Times |website= thetimes.co.uk |date= 5 January 2004 |access-date= 29 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; aspiring to apply his knowledge of modern languages as a commodities broker in the [[City of London#Economy|City]].&lt;ref name="CBPerf2000"&gt;{{cite book|last= Barda |first= Clive |year= 2000 |title= Performance! Musicians in Photographs |location= London |publisher= Peter Biddulph|isbn= 978-0952-01094-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|19}} His early interest in photography was mostly documentary; while studying for his degree, he travelled to [[Romania]] to photograph the [[Churches of Moldavia|painted monasteries]] of [[Moldavia]].&lt;ref name="CBPerf2000"/&gt;{{rp|20}} When he was twenty, following a friend's suggestion, he attended his first concert of classical music: an evening of Viennese music conducted by [[John Barbirolli]]. Soon after, he started attending concerts several times per week, and listening regularly to [[BBC Radio 3]].&lt;ref name="CBPerf2000"/&gt;{{rp|20}}

==Career==
Barda decided to combine his interests in photography and classical music, and a chance encounter with a journalist for ''South Wales Magazine'' led to his first commission: photographing the harpist Susan Drake at home, on 12 November 1968.&lt;ref name="CBPerf2000"/&gt;{{rp|21}}&lt;ref name="SDHyperion"&gt;{{cite web

{{quote|text=In 1969, I went to a concert at London's [[South Bank]], where pianist [[Daniel Barenboim]] and the cellist [[Jacqueline du Pré]] were playing Beethoven sonatas. [...] Barenboim was the most famous musician I had come close to and I decided to ask if I could photograph him conducting. To my amazement, Barenboim said "OK".|author=Clive Barda|title=''Performance! Musicians in Photographs''|source="An Interview with Clive Barda" by Graeme Kay}}
{{clear}}

The rehearsal took place at the [[Queen Elizabeth Hall]] the following Tuesday, and Barda showed the resulting [[Contact print|contact sheets]] to Barenboim a few days later, in the [[Royal Festival Hall]]'s green room. There, he also met [[Peter Andry]], a senior executive at [[EMI]], who suggested that Barda show his pictures to the art department at EMI. This immediately led to Barda's first major commission: to photograph [[Yehudi Menuhin]], at EMI's [[Abbey Road Studios|No. 1 Studio, Abbey Road]].&lt;ref name="CBPerf2000"/&gt;{{rp|21}}

When commissioned for a project, Barda asks what music will be played, since it is his understanding of the piece that will enable him to anticipate the decisive split second at which a good picture might be taken. As he explained: "Music is constantly punctuated. [...] There are narrative passages, there are peaks and troughs. The pictures occur at the peaks, the climaxes. Even if you don't know the music&amp;mdash;though it helps if you do&amp;mdash;you develop a sixth sense for these highs."&lt;ref name="CBGuardianCH2000"/&gt;

[[Vladimir Ashkenazy]] has stated that one of the secrets of Barda’s success "is his rare gift of being unnoticed, discreet and unobtrusive while doing his work."&lt;ref name="CBPerf2000"/&gt;{{rp|7}}

[[File:Colorspace.png|thumb|right|A comparison of the chromaticities enclosed by some color spaces.]]

A '''color space''' is a specific organization of [[color]]s. In combination with physical device profiling, it allows for reproducible representations of color, in both [[analog signal|analog]] and [[Digital data|digital]] representations. A color space may be arbitrary, with particular colors assigned to a set of physical [[Palette (computing)|color swatches]] and corresponding assigned [[color name]]s or numbers such as with the [[Pantone]] collection, or structured mathematically as with the [[Natural Color System|NCS System]], [[Adobe RGB color space|Adobe RGB]] and [[sRGB]]. A "[[color model]]" is an abstract mathematical model describing the way colors can be represented as [[tuple]]s of numbers (e.g. triples in [[RGB color model|RGB]] or quadruples in [[CMYK color model|CMYK]]); however, a color model with no associated mapping function to an [[absolute color space]] is a more or less arbitrary color system with no connection to any globally understood system of color interpretation. Adding a specific mapping function between a color model and a reference color space establishes within the reference color space a definite "footprint", known as a [[gamut]], and for a given color model this defines a color space. For example, Adobe RGB and sRGB are two different absolute color spaces, both based on the RGB color model. When defining a color space, the usual reference standard is the [[Lab color space|CIELAB]] or [[CIE 1931 color space|CIEXYZ]] color spaces, which were specifically designed to encompass all colors the average human can see.

Since "color space" identifies a particular combination of the color model and the mapping function, the word is often used informally to identify a color model. However, even though identifying a color space automatically identifies the associated color model, such a usage is incorrect in a strict sense. For example, although several specific color spaces are based on the [[RGB color model]], there is no such thing as the singular [[RGB color space]].

==History==
[[File:YoungHelm.jpg|thumb| [[Thomas Young (scientist)|Thomas Young]] and [[Hermann Helmholtz]] assumed that the eye's [[retina]] consists of three different kinds of light receptors for red, green and blue]] In 1802, [[Thomas Young (scientist)|Thomas Young]] postulated the existence of three types of photoreceptors (now known as [[cone cells]]) in the eye, each of which was sensitive to a particular range of visible light.&lt;ref&gt;Young, T., 1802. Bakerian Lecture: On the Theory of Light and Colours. ''Phil. Trans. R. Soc. Lond.'' 92:12-48. doi: 10.1098/rstl. 1802.0004&lt;/ref&gt; [[Hermann von Helmholtz]] developed the [[Young–Helmholtz theory]] further in 1850: that the three types of cone photoreceptors could be classified as short-preferring ([[blue]]), middle-preferring ([[green]]), and long-preferring ([[red]]), according to their response to the wavelengths of light striking the [[retina]]. The relative strengths of the signals detected by the three types of cones are interpreted by the [[brain]] as a visible color. But it's not clear that they thought of colours as being points in color space.

The color-space concept was likely due to [[Hermann Grassmann]], who developed it in two stages. First, he developed the idea of [[vector space]], which allowed the algebraic representation of geometric concepts in &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt;-dimensional space. [http://www.maa.org/sites/default/files/pdf/upload_library/22/Ford/DesmondFearnleySander.pdf Fearnley-Sander (1979)] describes Grassmann's foundation of linear algebra  as follows:

{{cquote|The definition of a [[linear space]] (vector space)... became widely known around 1920, when [[Hermann Weyl]] and others published formal definitions. In fact, such a definition had been given thirty years previously by [[Peano]], who was thoroughly acquainted with Grassmann's mathematical work. Grassmann did not put down a formal definition --- the language was not available --- but there is no doubt that he had the concept.}}

With this conceptual background, in 1853, Grassmann published a theory of how colors mix; it and its three color laws are still taught, as [[Grassmann's law (optics)|Grassmann's law]].&lt;ref name="Grassman1853"&gt;Grassmann, H. (1853). Zur Theorie der Farbenmischung. Poggendorffs Annalen der Physik, 89, 69–84.&lt;/ref&gt; {{cquote|As noted first by Grassmann... the light set has the structure of a cone in the infinite-dimensional linear space. As a result, a quotient set (with respect to metamerism) of the light cone inherits the conical structure, which allows color to be represented as a convex cone in the 3- D linear space, which is referred to as the color cone.&lt;ref name="Logvinenko2015"&gt;Logvinenko, A. D. (2015). The geometric structure of color. Journal of Vision, 15(1), 15.1.16. http://doi.org/10.1167/15.1.16&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==Examples==
[[File:RGB and CMYK comparison.png|thumb|right|A comparison of [[CMYK]] and [[RGB color model]]s. This image demonstrates the difference between how colors will look on a computer monitor (RGB) compared to how they will reproduce in a CMYK print process.]]

Colors can be created in [[printing]] with [[color]] spaces based on the [[CMYK color model]], using the subtractive [[primary colors]] of [[pigment]] ([[cyan]] (C), [[magenta]] (M), [[yellow]] (Y), and [[black]] (K)). To create a three-dimensional representation of a given color space, we can assign the amount of magenta color to the representation's X [[coordinate axis|axis]], the amount of cyan to its Y axis, and the amount of yellow to its Z axis. The resulting 3-D space provides a unique position for every possible color that can be created by combining those three pigments.

Colors can be created on [[computer monitor]]s with color spaces based on the [[RGB color model]], using the additive primary colors ([[red]], [[green]], and [[blue]]).  A three-dimensional representation would assign each of the three colors to the X, Y, and Z axes.  Note that colors generated on given monitor will be limited by the reproduction medium, such as the phosphor (in a [[CRT monitor]]) or filters and backlight ([[LCD]] monitor).

Another way of creating colors on a monitor is with an [[HSL and HSV|HSL or HSV]] color space, based on [[hue]], [[Saturation (color theory)|saturation]], [[brightness]] (value/brightness).  With such a space, the variables are assigned to [[cylindrical coordinates]].

Many color spaces can be represented as three-dimensional values in this manner, but some have more, or fewer dimensions, and some, such as Pantone, cannot be represented in this way at all.

==Conversion==
{{main|Color translation}}
Color space conversion is the translation of the representation of a color from one basis to another. This typically occurs in the context of converting an image that is represented in one color space to another color space, the goal being to make the translated image look as similar as possible to the original.

==RGB density==

The RGB color model is implemented in different ways, depending on the capabilities of the system used. By far the most common general-used incarnation {{As of|2006|lc=on}} is the 24-[[bit]] implementation, with 8 bits, or 256 discrete levels of color per [[channel (digital image)|channel]]. Any color space based on such a 24-bit RGB model is thus limited to a range of 256×256×256 ≈ 16.7 million colors. Some implementations use 16 bits per component for 48 bits total, resulting in the same [[gamut]] with a larger number of distinct colors. This is especially important when working with wide-gamut color spaces (where most of the more common colors are located relatively close together), or when a large number of digital filtering algorithms are used consecutively. The same principle applies for any color space based on the same color model, but implemented in different [[Color depth|bit depths]].

==Lists==
{{main|List of color spaces and their uses}}
[[CIE 1931 color space|CIE 1931 XYZ color space]] was one of the first attempts to produce a color space based on measurements of human color perception (earlier efforts were by [[James Clerk Maxwell]], König &amp; Dieterici, and Abney at [[Imperial College]])&lt;ref name="Wright1981"&gt;William David Wright, ''50 years of the 1931 CIE Standard Observer''. Die Farbe, '''29''':4/6 (1981).&lt;/ref&gt; and it is the basis for almost all other color spaces. The [[CIE 1931 color space#CIE RGB color space|CIERGB]] color space is a linearly-related companion of CIE XYZ. Additional derivatives of CIE XYZ include the  [[CIELUV]], [[CIE 1964 color space|CIEUVW]], and [[CIELAB]].

===Generic===
{{main|Color models}}
[[File:AdditiveColor.svg|thumbnail|200px|Additive color mixing: Three overlapping lightbulbs in a vacuum, adding together to create white.]]
[[File:SubtractiveColor.svg|thumbnail|200px|Subtractive color mixing: Three splotches of paint on white paper, subtracting together to turn the paper black.]]

[[RGB color space|RGB]] uses [[additive color]] mixing, because it describes what kind of ''light'' needs to be ''emitted'' to produce a given color. RGB stores individual values for red, green and blue. [[RGBA color space|RGBA]] is RGB with an additional channel, alpha, to indicate transparency.

Common color spaces based on the RGB model include [[sRGB]], [[Adobe RGB color space|Adobe RGB]], [[ProPhoto RGB color space|ProPhoto RGB]], [[scRGB]], and [[CIE 1931 color space#CIE RGB color space|CIE RGB]].

[[CMYK]] uses [[subtractive color]] mixing used in the printing process, because it describes what kind of [[inks]] need to be applied so the light ''reflected'' from the [[Substrate (printing)|substrate]] and through the inks produces a given color. One starts with a white substrate (canvas, page, etc.), and uses ink to subtract color from white to create an image. CMYK stores ink values for cyan, magenta, yellow and black. There are many CMYK color spaces for different sets of inks, substrates, and press characteristics (which change the dot gain or transfer function for each ink and thus change the appearance).

[[YIQ]] was formerly used in [[NTSC]] (North America, Japan and elsewhere) television broadcasts for historical reasons. This system stores a [[Luma (video)|luma]] value roughly analogous to (and sometimes incorrectly identified as)&lt;ref&gt;Charles Poynton, "YUV and 'luminance' considered harmful: a plea for precise terminology in video," [http://poynton.com/papers/YUV_and_luminance_harmful.html online],  author-edited version of Appendix A of Charles Poynton, ''Digital Video and HDTV: Algorithms and Interfaces'', Morgan–Kaufmann, 2003. [https://books.google.com/books?vid=ISBN1558607927&amp;id=ra1lcAwgvq4C&amp;pg=PA289&amp;lpg=PA289&amp;dq=luma+luminance+709+601&amp;sig=HXmxZa35yf3Zqj_Eb4PIlrU10Fo online]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Charles Poynton, [http://poynton.com/notes/video/Constant_luminance.html Constant Luminance], 2004&lt;/ref&gt; [[luminance (relative)|luminance]], along with two [[chrominance|chroma]] values as approximate representations of the relative amounts of blue and red in the color. It is similar to the [[YUV]] scheme used in most video capture systems&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | author = Dean Anderson | title = Color Spaces in Frame Grabbers: RGB vs. YUV | url = http://www.sensoray.com/support/frame_grabber_capture_modes.htm | accessdate = 2008-04-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in [[PAL]] (Australia, Europe, except France, which uses [[SECAM]]) television, except that the YIQ color space is rotated 33° with respect to the YUV color space and the color axes are swapped. The [[YDbDr]] scheme used by SECAM television is rotated in another way. &lt;!--
It would be nice if someone could find out how exactly the YDbDr color system is rotated.

[[YPbPr]] is a scaled version of YUV. It is most commonly seen in its digital form, [[YCbCr]], used widely in [[Video compression|video]] and [[image compression]] schemes such as [[MPEG]] and [[JPEG]].

[[xvYCC]] is a new international digital video color space standard published by the [[International Electrotechnical Commission|IEC]] (IEC 61966-2-4). It is based on the ITU BT.601 and [[Rec. 709|BT.709]] standards but extends the gamut beyond the R/G/B primaries specified in those standards.

[[HSV color space|HSV]] ('''h'''ue, '''s'''aturation, '''v'''alue), also known as HSB (hue, saturation, '''b'''rightness) is often used by artists because it is often more natural to think about a color in terms of hue and saturation than in terms of additive or subtractive color components. HSV is a transformation of an RGB color space, and its components and colorimetry are relative to the RGB color space from which it was derived.

[[HSL color space|HSL]] ('''h'''ue, '''s'''aturation, '''l'''ightness/'''l'''uminance), also known as HLS or HSI (hue, saturation, '''i'''ntensity) is quite similar to [[HSV color space|HSV]], with "lightness" replacing "brightness". The difference is that the ''brightness'' of a pure color is equal to the brightness of white, while the ''lightness'' of a pure color is equal to the lightness of a medium gray.

===Special-purpose===

* The [[RG Chromaticity]] space is used in [[computer vision]] applications.  It shows the color of light (red, yellow, green etc.), but not its intensity (dark, bright).
* The [[TSL color space]] (Tint, Saturation and Luminance) is used in [[face detection]].

===Obsolete===

Early color spaces had two components. They largely ignored blue light because the added complexity of a 3-component process provided only a marginal increase in fidelity when compared to the jump from monochrome to 2-component color.

==Absolute color space==

In [[colorimetry|color science]], there are two meanings of the term '''absolute color space''':
* A color space in which the perceptual difference between colors is directly related to [[color difference|distances between colors]] as represented by points in the color space.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title = Industrial Color Testing: Fundamentals and Techniques | author = Hans G. Völz | publisher = Wiley-VCH | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=-0jl6ai59MMC&amp;pg=PA40&amp;ots=tteI6jgqEu&amp;dq=%22absolute+color+space%22&amp;sig=903V904NfSz1UkWeirnsgm6wbNU  | isbn = 3-527-30436-3 | year = 2001 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title = Industrial Inorganic Pigments |author1=Gunter Buxbaum |author2=Gerhard Pfaff | publisher = Wiley-VCH | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=_OrB0ew_HgAC&amp;pg=PA24&amp;ots=Rg4iQsNSUs&amp;dq=%22absolute+color+space%22&amp;sig=3JIlmPmU9dlVmpYcrKp5qfPciwM | isbn = 3-527-30363-4 | year = 2005 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* A color space in which colors are unambiguous, that is, where the interpretations of colors in the space are colorimetrically defined without reference to external factors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title = Java 2D Graphics | author = Jonathan B.

In this article, we concentrate on the second definition.

[[CIE 1931 color space|CIEXYZ]], [[sRGB]], and [[ICtCp]] are examples of absolute color spaces, as opposed to a generic [[RGB color space]].

A non-absolute color space can be made absolute by defining its relationship to absolute colorimetric quantities. For instance, if the red, green, and blue colors in a monitor are measured exactly, together with other properties of the monitor, then RGB values on that monitor can be considered as absolute.  The [[Lab color space|L*a*b*]] is sometimes referred to as absolute, though it also needs a [[white point]] specification to make it so.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title = Optical Sensors and Sensing Systems for Natural Resources and Food Safety and Quality |author1=Yud-Ren Chen |author2=George E. Meyer |author3=Shu-I. Tu | publisher = SPIE | year = 2005 | isbn = 0-8194-6020-6 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=7IxTAAAAMAAJ&amp;q=%22absolute+color+space%22+l-a-b&amp;dq=%22absolute+color+space%22+l-a-b&amp;ei=hzeYR6XQEKeGtgP8mtHHCA&amp;pgis=1 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A popular way to make a color space like RGB into an absolute color is to define an [[International Color Consortium|ICC]] profile, which contains the attributes of the RGB. This is not the only way to express an absolute color, but it is the standard in many industries. RGB colors defined by widely accepted profiles include sRGB and [[Adobe RGB color space|Adobe RGB]]. The process of adding an [[ICC profile]] to a graphic or document is sometimes called ''tagging'' or ''embedding''; tagging therefore marks the absolute meaning of colors in that graphic or document.

===Conversion===
{{main|Color translation}}
A color in one absolute color space can be converted into another absolute color space, and back again, in general; however, some color spaces may have [[gamut]] limitations, and converting colors that lie outside that gamut will not produce correct results. There are also likely to be rounding errors, especially if the popular range of only 256 distinct values per component ([[8-bit color]]) is used.

One part of the definition of an absolute color space is the viewing conditions. The same color, viewed under different natural or artificial lighting conditions, will look different. Those involved professionally with color matching may use viewing rooms, lit by standardized lighting.

Occasionally, there are precise rules for converting between non-absolute color spaces. For example, [[HSL and HSV]] spaces are defined as mappings of RGB. Both are non-absolute, but the conversion between them should maintain the same color. However, in general, converting between two non-absolute color spaces (for example, RGB to [[CMYK color model|CMYK]]) or between absolute and non-absolute color spaces (for example, RGB to L*a*b*) is almost a meaningless concept.

===Arbitrary spaces===
A different method of defining absolute color spaces is familiar to many consumers as the swatch card, used to select paint, fabrics, and the like. This is a way of agreeing a color between two parties. A more standardized method of defining absolute colors is the [[Pantone|Pantone Matching System]], a proprietary system that includes swatch cards and recipes that commercial printers can use to make inks that are a particular color.

The [[history of literature]] of the [[Early Modern period]] ([[16th century in literature|16th]], [[17th century in literature|17th]] and partly [[18th century literature]]), or '''Early Modern literature''', succeeds [[Medieval literature]], and in Europe in particular [[Renaissance literature]].

In Europe, the Early Modern period lasts roughly from 1550 to 1750, spanning the [[Baroque period]] and ending with the [[Age of Enlightenment]] and the [[wars of the French Revolution]]. The Early Modern period in [[Persia]] corresponds to the rule of the [[Safavid dynasty]]. In [[Japan]], the "Early Modern period" ([[Edo period]]) is taken to last down to 1868 (the beginning of Industrialization during the [[Meiji period]]). In [[India]], the [[Mughal era]] lasts until the establishment of the [[British Raj]] in 1857. The [[Ottoman Empire]] underwent various attempts of modernization from 1828 ([[Tanzimat]]).

[[Chinese literature]] of the [[Qing dynasty]] remains mostly unaffected by European influence, and effects of modernization that would lead up to the [[New Culture Movement]] became apparent only from the Late Qing period in the 1890s.

== Europe ==
{{See|Early Modern English literature|Elizabethan literature|Jacobean era literature|Restoration literature|Augustan literature|German literature of the Baroque period|French literature of the 17th century}}

A new spirit of science and investigation in Europe was part of a general upheaval in human understanding, which began with the discovery of the [[New world]] in 1492 and continues through the subsequent centuries, even up to the present day.

The form of writing now commonplace across the world—the [[novel]]—originated from the early modern period and grew in popularity in the next century.  Before the [[modern novel]] became established as a form there first had to be a transitional stage when "novelty" began to appear in the style of the epic poem.

Plays for entertainment (as opposed to religious enlightenment) returned to Europe's stages in the early modern period.  [[William Shakespeare]] is the most notable of the early modern playwrighters, but numerous others made important contributions, including [[Pierre Corneille]], [[Molière]], [[Jean Racine]], [[Pedro Calderón de la Barca]], [[Lope de Vega]] and [[Christopher Marlowe]]. From the 16th to the 18th century [[commedia dell'arte]] performers improvised in the streets of Italy and France. Some Commedia dell'arte plays were written down. Both the written plays and the [[improvisation]] were influential upon literature of the time, particularly upon the work of Molière. Shakespeare drew upon the arts of [[jester]]s and strolling players in creating new style comedies. All the parts, even the female ones, were played by men (''[[Drag (clothing)|en travesti]]'') but that would change, first in France and then in England too, by the end of the 17th century.

The earliest work considered an [[opera]] in the sense the work is usually understood dates from around 1597. It is ''[[Dafne]]'', (now lost) written by [[Jacopo Peri]] for an elite circle of literate [[Florence|Florentine]] [[Humanism|humanists]] who gathered as the "[[Florentine Camerata|Camerata]]".

[[Miguel de Cervantes]]'s ''[[Don Quixote de la Mancha]]'' has been called "the first novel" by many literary scholars (or the first of the modern European novels). It was published in two parts. The first part was published in 1605 and the second in 1615. It might be viewed as a parody of ''Le Morte d'Arthur'' (and other examples of the [[Romance (heroic literature)|chivalric romance]]), in which case the novel form would be the direct result of poking fun at a collection of heroic folk legends. This is fully in keeping with the spirit of the age of enlightenment which began from about this time and delighted in giving a satirical twist to the stories and ideas of the past. It is worth noting that this trend toward satirising previous writings was only made possible by the [[printing press]]. Without the invention of [[mass production|mass-produced]] copies of a book it would not be possible to assume the reader will have seen the earlier work and will thus understand the references within the text. In the 18th century [[Daniel Defoe]] and [[Jonathan Swift]] wrote famous novels.

The 16th century saw outstanding [[epic poem]]s of [[Torquato Tasso]] and [[Luís de Camões]]. Later the most well-known [[poet]]s were [[Juana Inés de la Cruz]], [[John Milton]] and [[Alexander Pope]]. In turn [[Jean de La Fontaine]] and [[Charles Perrault]] are appreciated for their [[fable]]s.

== Ottoman Empire ==
{{Main|Ottoman literature}}
{{See|Prose of the Ottoman Empire|Poetry of the Ottoman Empire}}

The two primary streams of Ottoman written literature are poetry and [[prose]]. Of the two, poetry—specifically, Divan poetry—was by far the dominant stream. Moreover, until the 19th century, Ottoman prose did not contain any examples of [[fiction]]; that is, there were no counterparts to, for instance, the European [[Romance (heroic literature)|romance]], [[short story]], or [[novel]] (though analogous genres did, to some extent, exist in both the Turkish folk tradition and in Divan poetry).

Ottoman Divan poetry was a highly [[ritual]]ized and [[symbol]]ic art form. From the Persian poetry that largely inspired it, it inherited a wealth of [[symbol]]s whose meanings and interrelationships—both of similitude (مراعات نظير ''mura'ât-i nazîr'' / تناسب
''tenâsüb'') and opposition (تضاد ''tezâd'')—were more or less prescribed.

Until the 19th century, Ottoman prose never managed to develop to the extent that contemporary Divan poetry did. A large part of the reason for this was that much prose was expected to adhere to the rules of ''sec{{'}}'' (سجع, also transliterated as ''seci''), or [[rhymed prose]],&lt;ref&gt;Belge, 389&lt;/ref&gt; a type of writing descended from the Arabic ''[[saj']]'' and which prescribed that between each adjective and noun in a sentence, there must be a [[rhyme]].

Nevertheless, there was a tradition of prose in the literature of the time. This tradition was exclusively [[Non-fiction|nonfictional]] in nature—the [[fiction]] tradition was limited to narrative poetry.&lt;ref&gt;One apparent exception was the ''Muhayyelât'' (مخيّلات "''Fancies''") of [[Giritli Ali Aziz Efendi|Ali Aziz Efendi]] of [[Crete]], a collection of stories of [[Fantastic|the fantastic]] that was written in 1796, though not published until 1867.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Persia ==
{{See|Persian literature}}

Regarding the tradition of Persian love poetry during the [[Safavid dynasty|Safavid]] era, Persian historian [[Ehsan Yarshater]] notes, "As a rule, the beloved is not a woman, but a young man. In the early centuries of Islam, the raids into [[Central Asia]] produced many young [[slavery|slaves]]. Slaves were also bought or received as gifts. They were made to serve as pages at court or in the households of the affluent, or as soldiers and bodyguards. Young men, slaves or not, also, served wine at banquets and receptions, and the more gifted among them could play music and maintain a cultivated conversation. It was [[Pederasty|love toward young pages, soldiers, or novices in trades and professions]] which was the subject of lyrical introductions to panegyrics from the beginning of Persian poetry, and of the ghazal."&lt;ref&gt;Yar-Shater, Ehsan. 1986. ''Persian Poetry in the Timurid and Safavid Periods,'' Cambridge History of Iran. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, pp.973-974. 1986&lt;/ref&gt;

After the 15th century, the ''Indian style'' of Persian poetry (sometimes also called ''Isfahani'' or ''Safavi'' styles) took over. This style has its roots in the [[Timurid dynasty|Timurid]] era and produced the likes of [[Amir Khusro|Amir Khosrow Dehlavi]], and Bhai [[Nand Lal Goya]]

== India ==
{{See|Indian literature|Early Modern Bengali literature|Early Modern Tamil literature|Literature of the Kingdom of Mysore}}

[[Classical Sanskrit literature]] went into decline in the High Middle Ages, to the benefit of [[Middle Indic]] vernaculars such as [[Old Hindi]], notably in use for Late Medieval [[Bhakti]] poetry. The [[Mughal era]] sees the development of various literary dialects such as ''[[Dakkhini]]'' or ''[[Urdu]]'', the latter showing heavy [[Persianization|Persian influence]].
The earliest examples of [[Khariboli]] can be seen in some of [[Kabir]] and [[Amir Khusro]]'s lines. More developed forms of Khariboli can be seen in some mediocre literature produced in early 18th century. Examples are ''Chand Chhand Varnan Ki Mahima'' by Gangabhatt, ''Yogavashishtha'' by Ramprasad Niranjani, ''Gora-Badal ki katha'' by Jatmal, ''Mandovar ka varnan'' by Anonymous, a translation of Ravishenacharya's ''Jain Padmapuran'' by Daulatram (dated 1824).

== Japan ==
{{See|Japanese literature}}

Literature during the largely peaceful [[Edo period|Edo Period]], in large part to the rise of the working and middle classes in the new capital of [[Edo]] (modern [[Tokyo]]), developed forms of popular drama which would later evolve into [[kabuki]].
The [[Jōruri (music)|joruri]] and kabuki dramatist [[Chikamatsu Monzaemon]] became popular at the end of the 17th century. [[Matsuo Bashō]] wrote ''[[Oku no Hosomichi]]'' (奥の細道, 1702), a travel diary. [[Hokusai]], perhaps Japan's most famous woodblock print artist, also illustrated fiction as well as his famous [[36 Views of Mount Fuji (Hokusai)|36 Views of Mount Fuji]].

Many genres of literature made their début during the Edo Period, helped by a rising literacy rate among the growing population of townspeople, as well as the development of lending libraries. Although there was a [[Rangaku|minor Western influence]] trickling into the country from the [[Dejima|Dutch settlement at Nagasaki]], it was the importation of Chinese vernacular fiction that proved the greatest outside influence on the development of Early Modern Japanese fiction. [[Ihara Saikaku]] might be said to have given birth to the modern consciousness of the novel in Japan, mixing vernacular dialogue into his humorous and cautionary tales of the pleasure quarters. [[Jippensha Ikku]] wrote ''[[Tōkaidōchū Hizakurige]]'', which is a mix of travelogue and comedy. Tsuga Teisho, Takebe Ayatari, and Okajima Kanzan were instrumental in developing the ''[[yomihon]]'', which were historical romances almost entirely in prose, influenced by Chinese vernacular novels such as [[Three Kingdoms]] and ''[[Shui hu zhuan]]''. Two ''yomihon'' masterpieces were written by [[Ueda Akinari]]: ''Ugetsu monogatari'' and ''Harusame monogatari''.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6644">{{about|the narrative device}}
A '''flashforward''' (also spelled '''flash-forward''') is a scene that temporarily takes the [[narrative]] forward in time from the current point of the story in literature, film, television and other media.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.thefreedictionary.com/flash-forward&lt;/ref&gt; Flashforwards are often used to represent events expected, projected, or imagined to occur in the future. They may also reveal significant parts of the story that have not yet occurred, but soon will in greater detail. It is similar to [[foreshadowing]], in which future events are not shown but rather implicitly hinted at. It is primarily a [[postmodern literature|postmodern]] [[narrative device]], named by analogy to the more traditional [[Flashback (narrative)|flashback]], which reveals events that occurred in the past.

== Examples in literature ==
An early example of prolepsis which predates the postmodern period is [[Charles Dickens]]' novel ''[[A Christmas Carol]]'', in which the protagonist [[Ebenezer Scrooge]] is shown the future following his death. The subsequent events of the story imply that this future will be averted by this foreknowledge.

[[Terry Brooks]]' ''[[Word &amp; Void]]'' series features a [[protagonist]] who, when he sleeps, moves forwards and backwards through time to before and after a great cataclysm. This is both [[analepsis]] and prolepsis.

[[Muriel Spark]] makes extensive use of prolepsis in her novel ''[[The Prime of Miss Jean Brodie (novel)|The Prime of Miss Jean Brodie]]''.

== Examples in television ==
Every season of ''[[Damages (TV series)|Damages]]'' makes an extensive use of flashforwards, revealing the outcome of the season to the viewer. The whole season then revolves around discovering the circumstances that led to this outcome. For instance, the first season starts with a flashforward of the protagonist, Ellen Parsons, running in the streets of New York, covered in blood. 6 months earlier, she was only a naive young woman who had just become a lawyer in the firm of a powerful attorney, Patty Hewes. What led Ellen to the situation presented in the flashforwards is revealed little by little throughout the season. Furthermore, the series is known for its misleading use of flashforwards, which are often examples of the [[red herring]] device.

After making extensive use of flashbacks in the first two seasons, the TV series ''[[Lost (TV series)|Lost]]'' used flashforwards throughout the remainder of the series. The first use of this was in the third-season finale: what appeared to be a flashback to before the characters were stranded on the island, was revealed at the end to be a flashforward of them returned to civilization. A later episode featured what appeared to be flashforwards involving the couple Jin and Sun, showing them safely returned home and awaiting the birth of their baby, but it is then revealed that Jin's scenes were flashbacks and only Sun's were flashforwards.

The series finale of ''[[Star Trek: Voyager]]'', "[[Endgame (Star Trek: Voyager)|Endgame]]", uses a technique similar to a flashforward. It depicts a future in which the U.S.S. ''Voyager'' has returned home after decades lost in deep space with various personal tragedies, prompting the ship's captain to use [[time travel]] to return to the timeframe of the series and return the crew home more directly.

The U.S. [[Science fiction film|sci-fi]] TV series ''[[FlashForward]]'' revolves around everyone on Earth losing consciousness for 137 seconds, during which each person experiences a glimpse of events 6 months in the future.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1441135&lt;/ref&gt;  The series was itself based loosely on the novel [[Flashforward (novel)|Flashforward]] by [[Robert J. Sawyer]].

British soap opera ''[[Hollyoaks]]'' flashed forward six months in May 2010 for a special episode.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/soaps/s13/hollyoaks/news/a191387/hollyoaks-to-air-flashforward-episode.html|title=Hollyoaks to air flashforward episode|publisher=Digital Spy|first=Kris|last=Green|date=15 December 2009|accessdate=2009-12-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The last episode of ''[[Six Feet Under (TV series)|Six Feet Under]]'' has an extensive flashforward depicting the deaths of all the central characters for several decades in the future.

''[[Breaking Bad]]'' uses flashforwards throughout its second season showing a mystery regarding debris and corpses in Walter White's house and neighborhood, revealed to be the result of two planes crashing overhead. The first half of the fifth season begins with a flashforward one year into the future where Walter is fifty-two years old, and the second half begins with a continuation of the story, where he returns to his abandoned home. The plot of these flashforwards is resumed in the [[Felina (Breaking Bad)|series finale]].

''[[How to Get Away with Murder]]'' uses in every episode flashforwards of scenes from future episodes until episode 9.

''[[Quantico (TV series)|Quantico]]'' used flashforwards in order to unravel the future events that have occurred in the first and second season.

== Examples in film ==
Midway through the film ''[[They Shoot Horses, Don't They? (film)|They Shoot Horses, Don't They?]]'', there is an abrupt flashforward when Robert, the character played by [[Michael Sarrazin]], is seen being thrust into a jail cell by a police officer, even though he has done nothing to provoke such treatment. The audience is notified, later in the story, that Sarrazin's character would have indeed made choices that warrant his arrest.

The film ''[[Arrival (film)|Arrival]]'' relies extensively on prolepsis throughout the movie. The main character gains this ability after learning the language of the aliens, and proceeds to use it to prevent the outbreak of war. She uses information revealed to her in the future to convince an important official not to attack the aliens, and to give her said information in the future.

== Examples in video games ==
In ''[[Until Dawn]]'', players may find artifacts left by the [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native American]] tribe who lived on the mountain that show premonitions of possible future events. Whether they come true is dependent on player actions; for example, one shows another character's death in a scene that can be avoided.

'''''Flatliners''''' is a 2017 American [[Science fiction film|science fiction]] [[psychological horror]] film directed by [[Niels Arden Oplev]] and written by [[Ben Ripley]]. The film is a remake of the [[Flatliners|1990 film of the same name]], and stars [[Ellen Page]], [[Diego Luna]], [[Nina Dobrev]], [[James Norton (actor)|James Norton]] and [[Kiersey Clemons]]. It follows five medical students who attempt to conduct experiments that produce [[near-death experience]]s. 

[[Sony Pictures]] released the film in the United States on September 29, 2017. It received generally negative reviews from critics, with many comparing it unfavorably to the original, but it was a moderate box office success, grossing $45 million worldwide on a $19 million budget.

==Plot==
&lt;!-- 400 to 700 words only in this section. --&gt;
A medical student, Courtney ([[Ellen Page]]), is obsessed with the idea of the afterlife, wanting to find out what happens after death. She invites fellow students Jamie ([[James Norton (actor)|James Norton]]) and Sophia ([[Kiersey Clemons]]) to join her in an experiment, in an unused hospital room: using defibrillation to stop her heart for sixty seconds whilst recording her brain, and then reviving her. She assures them they would not be held responsible for any accidents. Sophia is against this, but Jamie does it anyway. After sixty seconds, they panic as they are unable to revive her, but eventually manage to with the help of fellow student Ray ([[Diego Luna]]). Later, Marlo ([[Nina Dobrev]]), a rival of Ray, arrives and learns of the experiment.

Initially Courtney begins to recall memories of past events such as her grandmother's recipe for bread. Courtney experiences increased intelligence and euphoria, being suddenly able to play the piano after 12 years and answer questions in class perfectly. Envious, Jamie flatlines, but has a disturbing near death experience as he meets his ex-girlfriend. Marlo and Sophia follow suit and flatline, for an increasing number of minutes. During Sophia’s turn they are nearly caught and flee the hospital and arrive at a party. Courtney and Jamie start seeing visions of past mistakes, but do not tell the others.

It soon turns into a living horror as those who flatlined find themselves haunted by their visions: Courtney is haunted by her dead sister Tessa from a car crash she caused because she was using her phone. Jamie is haunted by the baby of his ex-girlfriend whom he got pregnant and begged to get an abortion. Marlo is haunted by a man named Cyrus (who was stung by jellyfish) whom she killed when she accidentally mixed up his medication, and Sophia is haunted by a girl named Irina whose life she ruined out of jealousy by hacking her phone and sending out her nudes. This allowed Sophia to become [[valedictorian]]. They realize there is a downside to flatlining.

The hauntings get more and more intense. Courtney, traumatised by her visions, records a message apologising for the consequences and admitting that her interest in flatlining was due to the death of her sister, not for scientific discovery. Shortly after, she is chased by visions of her dead sister and falls to her death from the fire escape of her apartment building after her sister's ghost appears in front of her and pushes her off. The others are devastated when they learn of Courtney’s death and then panic when they realize they may be implicated if anyone discovers their experiments. After attempting to remove all notes and evidence from Courtney’s apartment, Marlo is sent to the morgue to find Courtney’s phone. She is once again haunted by visions. Meanwhile, on his boat, Jaime again hears the cries of a baby and a woman weeping. He falls out of his boat and swims to the dock where a figure stabs him in his hand. 

The group watches Courtney's recording and find out that she had encountered similar hauntings. They come clean to the mistakes that they made and soon come to the conclusion that the hauntings they're experiencing are their hallucinations because of guilt from their past sins, not paranormal beings. Ray, the only one who didn't flatline, initially disbelieves what's happening. 

The group takes action to stop the hallucinations by fixing their past mistakes. Sophia visits Irina to apologize, which Irina accepts. Jamie visits his ex-girlfriend and discovers she didn't get an abortion, but kept the baby; he apologizes and promises to provide for his son. Later, Ray and Marlo get into a fight when Ray finds out Marlo covered up the real reason Cyrus died and she refuses to come clean. Marlo is suffocated while driving and crashes her car. Tired of being haunted by her hallucinations, Marlo flatlines on her own in the hope of asking forgiveness of the patient that died due to her mistake. Ray, Sophia, and Jamie rush to stop her and are successful in resuscitating Marlo after she sees an apparition of Courtney who tells Marlo that she needs to forgive herself. In the end, Marlo, Ray, Sophia, and Jamie reminisce about Courtney and celebrate their friendships in the little restaurant they hang out at, where there is a performance of the piano piece that Courtney played. The movie ends with Jamie proposing a toast, honoring Courtney.

[[File:George Richmond self-portrait c1830 drawing.jpg|thumb|right|upright|Self-portrait, ca. 1830]]

'''George Richmond''' {{Post-nominals|post-noms=[[List of Royal Academicians|RA]]}} (28 March 1809 &amp;ndash; 19 March 1896) was an English painter and portraitist. In his youth he was a member of [[Ancients (art group)|The Ancients]], a group of followers of [[William Blake]]. Later in life he established a career as a portrait painter, which included painting the portraits of the British [[gentry]], [[nobility]] and [[royal family|royalty]].

He was the son of [[Thomas Richmond (miniature-painter)|Thomas Richmond]], miniature-painter, and was the father of the painter [[William Blake Richmond]] as well as the grandfather of the naval historian, Admiral Sir [[Herbert Richmond]].

===Early life===
George was born at [[Brompton, London|Brompton]], then a country village, on 28 March 1809. His mother, Ann Richmond, came of an Essex family named Oram, and was a woman of great beauty and force of character. His brother [[Thomas Richmond]] was also a portrait artist.

One of his earliest recollections was the sight of the lifeguards marching to the cavalry barracks at Brompton on their return from the campaign of Waterloo, and he remembered when a lad walking for a mile beside the Duke of York, in order to sketch him for his father, from whom he received his first instruction in art. He went for a short time only to a day school kept by an old dame in [[Soho]], and at fifteen became a student at the [[Royal Academy]]. Here he was much impressed by the personality of [[Henry Fuseli]], then professor of painting, formed a friendship, which lasted a lifetime, with [[Samuel Palmer]], and had as fellow-students and companions Edward Calvert, [[Thomas Sidney Cooper]], esq., R.A., and [[Frederick Tatham]], whose sister he married. Among other early friends was John Giles, Palmer's cousin, and a man of devout life and deep religion, who deeply influenced the literary taste, general culture, and religious views of his friends.

===Blake and the Ancients===
[[File:Richmond Woman of Samaria.jpg|thumb|''Christ and the Woman of Samaria'' (1825), one of Richmond's early works, influenced by the art of William Blake.]]
When Richmond was sixteen he met [[William Blake]], of whom Palmer and Calvert were devoted admirers, at the house of [[John Linnell]] at Highgate. The same night Richmond walked home across the fields to Fountain Court with the poet and painter, who left on Richmond's mind a profound impression, ‘as though he had been walking with the prophet Isaiah.’ From this time till Blake's death, Richmond followed his guidance and inspiration in art. Traces of Blake's influence are seen in all Richmond's early works, and especially in ‘Abel the Shepherd,’ and in ‘Christ and the Woman of Samaria,’ exhibited at the Royal Academy in 1825.&lt;ref name="DNB00" /&gt; In 1827 he was present at Blake's death, and had the sad privilege of closing the poet's eyes and taking his death mask; he, his wife Julia, and a little band of young enthusiasts, of whom he was the last survivor, followed Blake to his grave in [[Bunhill Fields]].&lt;ref name="Tatham"&gt;{{cite book|last=Tatham|first=Frederick|authorlink=Frederick Tatham|editor=A G B Russell|title=The Letters of  William Blake together with His Life  by  F.

Along with Palmer, Calvert, Tatham and others he formed the Blake-influenced group known as "[[Ancients (art group)|The Ancients]]". This influence faded in later life, when he produced relatively conventional [[portrait]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Smetham|first=James|authorlink=James Smetham|editor=Gilchrist, A|title=Life of William Blake|url=http://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Life_of_William_Blake_%281880%29,_Volume_2/Essay_on_Blake_by_James_Smetham|edition=2|volume=2|year=1880|publisher=Macmillan|location=London|chapter=Essay on Blake}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Later life===
In 1828 Richmond went to Paris to study art and anatomy, the expenses of the journey being met from money earned by painting miniatures in England before leaving and in France during his stay. He spent a winter in the schools and hospitals, and saw something of the social life of the Paris of Charles X; at Calais he exchanged pinches of snuff with the exiled [[Beau Brummell]].

On his return to England he spent some time at the White Lodge, Richmond Park, with Lord Sidmouth, who gave him much valuable counsel, and whose portrait by him in watercolour is now in the National Portrait Gallery. In 1830 his contributions to the academy comprised two poetical subjects, ‘The Eve of Separation’ and ‘The Witch,’ from [[Ben Jonson]]'s ‘Sad Shepherdess,’ and three portraits. In 1831 he exhibited but one picture, ‘The Pilgrim.’

[[File:William Wilberforce by George Richmond (watercolour).jpg|thumb|Watercolour of William Wilberforce, 1833.]]He had now formed a deep attachment to Julia, a beautiful daughter of [[Charles Heathcote Tatham]], the architect, and when her father revoked the consent he had at first given to their union, the young couple ran away, journeyed to Scotland by coach in the deep snow of a severe winter, and were married according to Scottish law at [[Gretna Green]] in January 1831. This act proved the turning-point of Richmond's career, and determined him to adopt portraiture as the readiest means of earning a living. Soon after the young couple had set up house in Northumberland Street, they were found and befriended by Sir [[Robert Harry Inglis]], and it was at his instance that the portrait in watercolour of [[William Wilberforce]], afterwards engraved by [[Samuel Cousins]], was painted by Richmond; this picture, by its happy treatment of a difficult subject, and by the excellence of the engraving after it, achieved a worldwide success. There followed immediately many successful watercolour portraits, among which may be mentioned those of [[Charles John Shore, 2nd Baron Teignmouth|Lord Teignmouth]], the Frys, the Gurneys, the Buxtons, the Upchers, and the Thorntons, all traceable to Inglis's friendly introduction.

In 1837 Richmond was forced to take a rest for the sake of his health, which had broken down through overwork and the loss of three children within a very short time. He went to Rome with his wife and their surviving child Thomas, accompanied by Samuel Palmer and his bride, a daughter of John Linnell. During his stay in Italy, which lasted about two years, he made studies and copies of many of the subjects on the ceiling of the Sistine Chapel, having a scaffolding erected so as to reach the vault; here he made the acquaintance of [[Cardinal Mezzofanti]], of whose colloquial English he always spoke with wonder. Subsequently, he visited Naples, Pompeii, and the cities of Tuscany with Baring, for whom he painted a picture of 'The Journey to Emmaus.' While still in Rome he painted a picture of ‘Comus,’ afterwards exhibited. In southern Italy, Richmond painted three portraits in oil on canvas that would help establish his reputation as the pre-eminent portrait painter of his generation: '[http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:George_Richmond_Calabrian_Shepherd.JPG An Old Calabrian Shepherd]' (Feb. 1838), 'A Neapolitan' (Mar. 1837) and 'Vine Dresser' (Apr. 1838).

In Rome Richmond made many valuable friends, including Mr. and Mrs. Gladstone, [[Henry Acland]], the Severns, [[Sir Thomas Baring, 2nd Baronet|Thomas Baring]], [[Thomas Farrer, 1st Baron Farrer|Lord Farrer]], and [[John Sterling (author)|John Sterling]], and his house on the [[Tarpeian rock]] was a meeting-place for these young English travellers. John Sterling, in letters to [[Richard Chenevix Trench]], writes of Richmond as the most interesting young artist he had met. In after years he was one of the original members of the [[Sterling Club]]. He returned to England in 1839, and resumed his practice as a portrait-painter, revisiting Rome, however, with his brother Thomas in 1840. Then, as related in ‘Præterita,’ Richmond made the friendship of [[John Ruskin|Ruskin]], who later introduced him to [[Thomas Carlyle]]. About the same period Richmond travelled in Germany with John Hullah, alighting on Munich where he studied for a while under [[Peter von Cornelius]].

Richmond was a member of ‘The Club’ (Johnson's), [[Nobody's Friends]], [[Grillion's Club]], to which he was [[limner]], and the [[Athenaeum Club, London]].  A staunch churchman, he was intimate for years with all the leaders of the [[tractarian]] movement.  He received honorary degrees from the universities of Oxford and Cambridge, was a fellow of the [[Society of Antiquaries of London|Society of Antiquaries]], an honorary fellow of [[University College, London]], and of the [[Royal Institute of British Architects]], and a member of the [[Company of Painter-Stainers]] of the City of London.

In 1846 he was nominated by Gladstone to succeed Sir [[Augustus Wall Callcott]] on the council of the government schools of design, a post which he held for three years; and ten years later he was appointed a member of the royal commission to determine the site of the [[National Gallery]], when he was alone in voting for its removal from Trafalgar Square to South Kensington.  In 1871, and again in 1874, Gladstone pressed upon him to accept the directorship of the National Gallery, but the prime minister was unsuccessful.

George Richmond died at his house, 20 York Street, Portman Square, where he had lived and worked for fifty-four years, on 19 March 1896, retaining almost to the end a clear and vigorous memory.  He was buried at [[Highgate cemetery]], and is commemorated by a tablet designed by his sons to be placed in the crypt of [[St. Paul's Cathedral]], close to the graves of Wren and of Leighton.  He left ten children and forty grandchildren.

His surviving sons included [[Canon Richmond of Carlisle]] and Sir [[William Blake Richmond]], K.C.B., R.A. Of his daughters, three married respectively F. W. Farrer, Archdeacon Buchanan, canon of Salisbury, and Justice Kennedy.&lt;ref name=DNB00/&gt;

==Works==
[[File:Charlotte Brontë Richmond.tif|thumb|right|upright|[[Charlotte Brontë]] by George Richmond, 1850]]
Richmond's portraits of eminent persons in England were steadily produced for forty years, initially in [[crayon]] and [[watercolour]]. After 1846 he began to [[oil painting|paint in oil]], and left a large number of excellent portraits in this medium. Many of his portraits were reproduced as [[engraving]]s. The Victorian Exhibition held at the New Gallery in the winter of 1891–2 contained eight of his portraits in oil, forty in crayon, and two (Mrs. Fry and Sir Thomas Fowell Buxton, both dated 1845) in watercolour.

The oil pictures included Earl Granville, Archbishop Longley (1863), Bishops Selwyn and Wilberforce, [[Henry Liddon|Canon Liddon]], and Sir [[George Gilbert Scott]], R.A. (1877). Among the crayon portraits were [[Cardinal Newman]] (1844), [[John Keble]], [[Henry Hallam]] (1843), [[Charlotte Brontë]] (1850), [[Elizabeth Gaskell]] (1851), [[Lord Macaulay]] (1844 and 1850), Sir [[Charles Lyell]] (1853), [[Michael Faraday]] (1852), and [[Lord Lyndhurst]] (1847).

He also drew or painted [[Adelaide of Saxe-Meiningen|Queen Adelaide]], Prince George (at that time Duke) of Cambridge, and the Prince of Wales, (later [[Edward VII]]) when a boy; Lord Palmerston, Lord Aberdeen, the Duke of Newcastle, and Gladstone; Cardinal Manning, Archbishop Tait, and Dean Stanley; Sir Thomas Watson, Syme, Alison, and Sir James Paget; Prescott, [[Harriett Beecher Stowe]], Darwin, Owen, [[Harriet Martineau]] and Tyndall, and a host of others. Richmond was elected an associate of the [[Royal Academy]] in 1857, a royal academician in 1866, and some years before his death he joined the ranks of the retired academicians. He took a warm interest in the winter exhibitions of the old masters at the Royal Academy.

On the death of his wife in 1881 he gave up regular work, but still painted occasionally and occupied himself with sculpture. He had previously, in 1862, designed and executed a recumbent statue in marble of [[Charles James Blomfield]], bishop of London, for St. Paul's Cathedral, and in 1882 he executed the marble bust of Dr. Pusey, now in [[Pusey House, Oxford]], and presented a bust of [[John Keble]] to [[Keble College]]. Among his later works in oil were portraits of [[Harvey Goodwin]], bishop of Carlisle, [[Edward King (English bishop)|Edward King]], bishop of Lincoln, and [[Archibald Campbell Tait]], archbishop of Canterbury. In 1887, on the occasion of Queen Victoria's jubilee, he painted a portrait of the third Marquis of Salisbury (the last work he executed), which was presented to the queen by the marquis's wife.

His success as a portrait-painter was due as much to his power of drawing out the best from his sitter in conversation as to skill in delineation. Being a very skilful and rapid draughtsman, he was able, while putting himself into sympathy with his sitter, to report the happiest moment and fleeting changes of expression, and to get out of his subject more than at first sight appeared to be there. His ideal of portraiture was ‘the truth lovingly told;’ and he never consciously flattered. He was also a most industrious and clever sketcher from nature, and he produced (for his own pleasure and instruction) hundreds of drawings in pencil and watercolour, many of great beauty, of figure and landscape. To his skill as a portrait-painter were added great knowledge of Italian painting and sound judgment in matters of art, and the government were often glad to avail themselves of his services and advice.

In the [[National Portrait Gallery (London)|National Portrait Gallery]] are portraits by him of [[Lord Sidmouth]] (watercolour); Lord-chancellors Cranworth and Hatherley, Baron Cleasby and Lord Cardwell (oil paintings); [[Samuel Rogers]], the poet, and John Keble (crayon drawings), both bequeathed by the painter; besides drawings, purchased in July 1896, of Earl Canning, Viscount Hill, Sir [[George Cornewall Lewis]], Canon Liddon, Archbishop Longley, Sir Charles Lyell, Cardinal Newman, Dr. Pusey, Sir [[George Gilbert Scott|Gilbert Scott]], Sir [[Robert Harry Inglis]], and [[Samuel Wilberforce|Bishop Wilberforce]].&lt;ref name=DNB00&gt;{{cite DNB|wstitle = Richmond, George|first = William Cosmo|last = Monkhouse|authorlink = William Cosmo Monkhouse|volume = 48|quote=''citing:'' [''Men of the Time''; Times, 21 March 1896; Gilchrist's ''[[Life of William Blake|Life of Blake]];'' Story's ''Life of John Linnell''; A.

'''Giclée''' ({{IPAc-en|ʒ|iː|ˈ|k|l|eɪ}} {{respell|zhee|KLAY}}) is a [[neologism]] [[Coined term|coined]] in&amp;nbsp;1991 by [[Printmaking|printmaker]] Jack Duganne for [[fine art]] [[Digital printing|digital prints]] made on [[inkjet printer]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Johnson, Harald. [https://books.google.com/books?id=Dq3Xj8zEYMIC&amp;pg=PA11&amp;dq=giclee+prints+produced+on+epson#PPA11,M1 ''Mastering Digital Printing'', p.11] at Google Books&lt;/ref&gt; The name originally applied to fine art prints created on a modified [[Iris printer]] in a process invented in the late 1980s. It has since been used loosely to mean any fine-art, most of the times archival, inkjet print. It is often used by artists, galleries, and print shops to suggest high quality printing but since it is an unregulated word it has no associated warranty of quality.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=wjKzHzemCxAC&amp;pg=PA201&amp;dq=giclee+inkjet+printer&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=VcjtT46XGOiT0QH3vZWHDg&amp;ved=0CFsQ6AEwBQ#v=onepage&amp;q=giclee%20inkjet%20printer&amp;f=false Robert Hirsch, Greg Erf, Exploring Color Photography: From Film to Pixels, page 201]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Origins ==

The word ''giclée'' was adopted by Jack Duganne around 1990. He was a printmaker working at [[Graham Nash#Nash Editions|Nash Editions]]. He wanted a name for the new type of prints they were producing on a modified [[Iris printer]], a [[Large format (photography)|large-format]], [[Image resolution|high-resolution]] industrial [[prepress proofing]] inkjet printer on which the paper receiving the ink is attached to a rotating drum and that they had adapted for fine-art printing. He was specifically looking for a word that would differentiate them from regular commercial IRIS prints then used as proofs in the commercial printing industry. "Giclée" is based on the [[French language|French]] word ''gicleur'', the French technical term for a jet or a nozzle, and the verb coming from it "gicler" (to squirt out). "Une giclée" (noun) means a spurt of some liquid.&lt;ref&gt;Johnson, Harald. "What's In a Name: The True Story of Giclée", dpandi.com&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Casselman |first=Bill |url=http://www.billcasselman.com/unpublished_works/giclee.htm |title=Giclée |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160731171334/http://www.billcasselman.com/unpublished_works/giclee.htm |archivedate=31 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Harald"&gt;Johnson, Harald, Mastering Digital Printing, Second Edition, Thomson Course Technology - 2005, Chapter 1&lt;/ref&gt; The French [[verb]] form ''gicler'' means to spray, spout, or squirt. It describes the movement of a liquid that is suddenly under violent pressure and has only got a tiny hole to exit the compressed space in which it is. Duganne settled on the [[noun]] ''giclée''. &lt;ref&gt;Johnson, Harald. "What's In a Name: The True Story of Giclée", dpandi.com&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Grant, Daniel. [http://articles.baltimoresun.com/1999-01-25/entertainment/9901250193_1_giclee-ink-jet-prints-jet-printer "Ink-jet art runs gamut from low brow to high class"], Baltimore Sun&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Casselman |first=Bill |url=http://www.billcasselman.com/unpublished_works/giclee.htm |title=Giclée |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160731171334/http://www.billcasselman.com/unpublished_works/giclee.htm |archivedate=31 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Current usage ==

Besides its original association with Iris prints, the word ''giclée'' has come to be somewhat loosely associated with other types of [[inkjet printing]] including processes that use dyes or fade-resistant, archival inks ([[pigment]]-based), and archival substrates primarily produced on [[Canon Inc.|Canon]], [[Epson]], [[Hewlett-Packard|HP]] and other large-format printers.&lt;ref&gt;Luong, Q.-Tuan. [http://www.largeformatphotography.info/digital-printing.html An overview of large format color digital printing] at largeformatphotography.info&lt;/ref&gt; These printers use the [[CMYK]]&amp;nbsp; (Cyan, Magenta, Yellow and Black) color process as a base but may have other added color [[Ink cartridge|cartridges]] for better color or black and white rendition (such as light [[magenta]] and light [[cyan]], light and very light gray, even orange and green (Epson) inks in addition to regular cyan, magenta yellow and black inks); these improve the apparent color [[gamut]] and allow smoother gradient transitions and more accurate colors.&lt;ref&gt;Vandsburger, Judith. [http://www.signindustry.com/digital/articles/2003-01-31-NUR-8colorDigitalPrinting.php3 "8-Color Printing: What’s Hype and What’s Real?"], signindustry.com&lt;/ref&gt; A wide variety of [[Substrate (printing)|substrates]] on which an image can be printed with such inks are available, including various textures and finishes such as matte [[Photographic paper|photo paper]], [[Watercolor painting|watercolor]] paper, cotton [[canvas]], pre-coated canvas, or artist textured vinyl.

== Applications ==
{{Refimprove section|date=May 2014}}

Artists generally use inkjet printing to make reproductions of their original two-dimensional artwork, photographs, or [[Computer-generated imagery|computer-generated art]]. Professionally produced inkjet prints are much more expensive on a per-print basis than the four-color [[Offset printing|offset lithography]] process traditionally used for such reproductions. (A large-format inkjet print can cost more than&amp;nbsp;$50, not including scanning and [[color correction]], compared to $5 for a four-color offset litho print of the same image in a run of 1,000.) Four-color offset lithographic presses have the disadvantage of the full job having to be set up and produced all at once in a mass edition. With inkjet printing the artist does not have to pay for the expensive printing plate setup or the marketing and storage needed for large four-color offset print runs. This allows the artist to follow a [[just in time (business)|just-in-time]] business model in which inkjet printing can be an economical option, since art can be printed and sold individually in accordance with demand. Inkjet printing has the added advantage of allowing artists to take total control of the production of their images, including the final color correction and the substrates being used. As a result numerous individual artists own and operate their own printers.

'''Greta Zimmer Friedman''' (born '''Grete Zimmer'''; June 5, 1924&amp;nbsp;– September 8, 2016) was an Austrian-born American who was photographed being kissed by a stranger, a Navy [[sailor]], in the iconic ''[[V-J Day in Times Square]]'' photograph of 1945 by ''[[Life (magazine)|Life magazine]]'' photographer [[Alfred Eisenstaedt]].&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2016/sep/11/greta-zimmer-friedman-dies-kissed-sailor-world-war/|title=Greta Zimmer Friedman dies; kissed sailor in World War II iconic photo|last=|first=|date=September 11, 2016|website=The Washington Times|publisher=|access-date=2016-09-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; Widely misattributed as being a photograph of a nurse, she was actually a dental assistant with a similar uniform.

==Early life and education==
[[File:1939 Passport.jpg|thumb|1939 passport issued by the government of Austria for "Grete Sara Zimmer," the middle name added by national socialist decree]]

She was born Grete Zimmer on June 5, 1924 to a Jewish family in [[Wiener Neustadt]], Austria.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/09/11/nyregion/greta-friedman-who-claimed-to-be-the-nurse-in-a-famous-v-j-day-photo-dies-at-92.html|title=Greta Friedman, Who Claimed to Be the Nurse in a Famous V-J Day Photo, Dies at 92|last=Rosenberg|first=Eli|date=September 10, 2016|work=|newspaper=The New York Times|issn=0362-4331|access-date=2016-09-12|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; At age 15, Zimmer emigrated from Nazi-controlled Austria in 1939 with her younger sisters Josefin (Fini) and Bella; as Americans, Josefin became Josephine (Jo), while Grete and Bella traded the last letter of each name to become Greta and Belle. The eldest Zimmer sister Lily emigrated to Palestine, took the name Tirza, and remained in Israel after fighting in the 1948 War of Independence. Their parents, Max and Ida, unable to leave Europe, died in concentration camps during the [[The Holocaust|Holocaust]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://nypost.com/2012/06/17/the-true-story-behind-the-iconic-v-j-day-sailor-and-nurse-smooch/|title=The true story behind the iconic V-J Day sailor and ‘nurse’ smooch|last=Callahan|first=Maureen|date=June 17, 2012|website=New York Post|publisher=|access-date=2016-09-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Zimmer attended Queens Vocational High School, the Central High School of Needle Trades and the Harlem Evening High School. Supporting herself as a dental assistant, she then took classes at the [[Fashion Institute of Technology]] (FIT) and studied costuming with the New School of Social Research's [[Dramatic Workshop]], led by [[Erwin Piscator]]. Later, while living in New York in the 1940s and 1950s, she variously worked in toy design and doll clothing, as well as early television with the [[Bil Baird]] puppets, and summer theater at the Camp [[Tamiment]] Playhouse. 

==''V-J Day in Times Square''==
On VJ Day, August 14, 1945, Friedman had left work at the dentists' office dressed in her uniform and was celebrating the end of World War II in [[Times Square]] when a stranger dressed in a Navy sailor's uniform grabbed her and kissed her.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Photographer [[Alfred Eisenstaedt]], who was in Times Square documenting the celebration, captured the moment with his [[Leica Camera|Leica]]. The resulting photograph, ''[[V-J Day in Times Square]]'', was first published in ''[[Life (magazine)|Life]]'' magazine in 1945 with the caption, "In New York's Times Square a white-clad girl clutches her purse and skirt as an uninhibited sailor plants his lips squarely on hers".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/culture/news/greta-friedman-woman-in-times-square-kiss-photo-dead-at-92-w438994|title=Greta Friedman, Woman in Iconic Times Square Kiss Photo, Dead at 92|last=Kreps|first=Daniel|date=|website=Rolling Stone|publisher=|access-date=2016-09-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When Eisenstaedt took the photo, he failed to get any personal information from his subjects leaving their identities unknown for decades. In the ensuing years, many women claimed to be the woman in the photo. Friedman eventually saw the photo again the 1960s and instantly recognized herself. She wrote to ''Life'' magazine and provided additional photos to verify her identity.
''Life'' editors did not contact her until 1980 when, after researching and analysis, confirmed that Friedman was the woman in the photograph.&lt;ref name="lewis"&gt;{{cite web |last1=Lewis |first1=Danny |title=The Woman in the Iconic V-J Day Kiss Photo Died at 92, Here’s Her Story |url=https://www.smithsonianmag.com/smart-news/woman-iconic-v-j-photo-died-age-92-heres-her-story-180960435/ |website=Smithsonian.com |publisher=Smithsonianmag.com |accessdate=August 27, 2018 |date=September 14, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While ''V-J Day in Times Square'' went on to become an iconic photo that was generally viewed
as a celebratory and romantic photograph, Friedman had mixed feelings about it.&lt;ref name="lewis" /&gt; "It wasn’t my choice to be kissed," Friedman stated in a 2005 interview with the [[Library of Congress]].&lt;ref name="consent"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://memory.loc.gov/diglib/vhp/story/loc.natlib.afc2001001.42863/transcript?ID=sr0001|title=Interview Transcript: Greta Zimmer Friedman: Veterans History Project (Library of Congress)|last=Redmond|first=Patricia|date=August 23, 2005|website=American Memory|accessdate=September 12, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; "The guy just came over and grabbed!" she said, adding, "That man was very strong. I wasn’t kissing him. He was kissing me."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/famed-image-marking-v-j-day-sinister-shade-article-1.2774540|title=How a celebrated image marking V-J Day in Times Square has taken on a sinister shade|last=Martino|first=Andy|date=September 2, 2016|website=New York Daily News|accessdate=September 12, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; "I did not see him approaching, and before I know it I was in this tight grip," Friedman told [[CBS News]] in 2012.&lt;ref name="cbs"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cbsnews.com/news/greta-friedman-woman-kissed-in-iconic-v-j-day-photo-dead-at-92|title=Woman in V-J Day photo dead at 92|date=September 10, 2016|website=CBS News|accessdate=September 10, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Later years and death==
In 1956 she married Dr. Mischa Friedman, a WWII veteran of the U.S. Army Air Corps and a scientific researcher for the Army at [[Fort Detrick]], moving to [[Frederick, Maryland]]. She attended [[Hood College]], studying oil painting, printing, sculpture, and watercolors, but did not graduate until 1981, the same year her two grown children Mara and Joshua also graduated college. Friedman worked for ten years at Hood restoring books.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://memory.loc.gov/diglib/vhp/story/loc.natlib.afc2001001.42863/transcript?ID=sr0001|title=Interview Transcript: Greta Zimmer Friedman: Veterans History Project (Library of Congress|last=|first=|date=August 23, 2005|website=memory.loc.gov|publisher=|access-date=2016-09-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Larry Dell Alexander''' (born May 30, 1953) is an [[Americans|American]] artist, [[Christian]] author and [[Catechist]] from [[Dermott, Arkansas]] in [[Chicot County]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dermott.org/ - "Rural Community Alliance/Harrison, Arkansas"]&lt;/ref&gt; Alexander is best known for his creations of elaborate colorful, and black &amp; white "[[pen and ink]]" drawings in his "[[crosshatching]]", or "[[hatching]]" technique, and his acrylic paintings. He also received notoriety and a personal presidential thanks for his personal rendition of a "[[Clinton Family Portrait]]" oil painting which he gave to [[U.S. President]] [[Bill Clinton]] in 1995.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thelarrydalexander.com/LARRYDALEXANDER/larry-d-alexander-in-the-news/larry-d-alexander-news-023/ - "Larry Alexander strives to inspire young artists" - Fri.

==Early life and career==
[[File:The Artwork of Larry D. Alexander 005.jpg|thumb|"Send in the Clown", a "Pen &amp; Ink" "Crosshatching drawing" by Alexander]]
Born in the small rural town of [[Dermott, Arkansas]] to Robert and Janie Alexander, Larry is the fourth of ten children and the second of the union of his parents.  His father was a truck driver, and his mother was a beautician. Alexander began drawing at about the age of four. He never received any formal art training during any level of his schooling while growing up, as none was available in his small rural hometown. After graduating from [[Dermott High School]] in May 1971, Alexander moved to [[Pine Bluff, Arkansas]], where he studied Architectural Residential Design at Pines Vocational Technical School, now [[Southeast Arkansas College]]. In later years he also attended [[Richland College]] in [[Dallas, Texas]] where he studied [[AutoCAD]].

Today, six pieces of his work from his popular "Dermott Series", a series of paintings he painted about his childhood home of Dermott, are now a part of the permanent collection at [[the Arts and Science Center for Southeast Arkansas]] in [[Pine Bluff, Arkansas]]. Alexander's work is mostly influenced by his experiences in life, such as growing up in the rural south during the 1950s and 1960s, as well as his life in [[Detroit]], [[Michigan]] during the 1970s and 1980s.

Alexander moved to [[Detroit]], [[Michigan]] after two years of school in [[Pine Bluff]] to seek employment in his chosen field. However, he was unsuccessful in the short run, and instead, he ended up finding work in a [[Chrysler]] auto assembly plant and became fascinated with the innerworkings of cars. This led him to become a certified mechanic, a craft he worked at for the next seventeen years. He ultimately met and married his wife, Patricia while living in Detroit, and they moved their family to [[Irving, Texas]] where he opened his own auto repair shop and operated it until 1991.

Encouraged by Patricia, he began using his art talent for the first time in fifteen years. His career as a professional artist can be traced back to this point as he developed his "[[pen and ink]]" style that he calls "[[crosshatching]]", and used it to create several lines of greeting cards under his, now defunct, "Alexander Greeting Cards Company" name. He coined the phrase "The Expressions Line" for his first line of greeting cards in 1991, but did not trademark the name. As a result, [[Hallmark Cards]] now has used the name on a line of their cards since 1997. His line should not be confused or associated with their product line.&lt;ref&gt;[http://cocatalog.loc.gov/cgi-bin/Pwebrecon.cgi?Search_Arg=Alexander%2C+Larry+D.&amp;Search_Code=NALL&amp;PID=7hgPTsH43_NGlNt8hd8twcRb17De&amp;SEQ=20100318205238&amp;CNT=25&amp;HIST=1 - Library of Congress - Alexander, Larry Dell - 1953]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.faqs.org/copyright/alexander-greeting-card-company-presents-the-save-the/ - Alexander Greeting Cards - Larry Dell Alexander]&lt;/ref&gt; Between 1991 and 1994 he created over 80 pieces of "pen and ink" [[fine art]],&lt;ref name="cocatalog.loc.gov"&gt;[http://cocatalog.loc.gov/cgi-bin/Pwebrecon.cgi?Search_Arg=Alexander%2C+Larry+D.&amp;Search_Code=NALL&amp;PID=7hgPTsH43_NGlNt8hd8twcRb17De&amp;SEQ=20100318205238&amp;CNT=25&amp;HIST=1 - Library of Congress - Alexander, Larry D. - 1953]&lt;/ref&gt; including "Renetta", "Girlfriends", "Cowboy Fiddler", "Young Kennedys", and "Roundup". He also used many of his drawings on his "Fine-arTshirt" T-shirt line of the mid-nineties.&lt;ref&gt;[http://larrydalexander.netfirms.com/LarryD.Alexander-ArtfortheAges///home/users/web/b1499/nf.larrydalexander/public_html/LarryD.Alexander-ArtfortheAges//wp-content/uploads/2014/02/Larry%20D.%20Alexander%20News%20025.jpg - "Artist donates design to help homeless" - Artime Magazine/Irving News section - Oct. 1994 - page 2]&lt;/ref&gt;

Alexander is also a "[[realist painter]]" who works in a variety of other mediums including [[oil paint|oils]], [[acrylic paint|acrylics]], and [[watercolors]]. He is a self-taught artist who chooses mostly to do exhibits in venues that provide mainstream exposure to a large variety of people such as festivals, schools, malls, libraries, banks, art institutions, and even [[United States Postal Service|U.S. Post Office]] branches on occasion.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thelarrydalexander.com/LARRYDALEXANDER/larry-d-alexander-in-the-news/larry-d-alexander-in-the-news-2/"Texas artist to show new prints at festival" - Pine Bluff Commercial - Friday May 20, 2005 - page 1D]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thelarrydalexander.com/LARRYDALEXANDER/larry-d-alexander-in-the-news/larry-d-alexander-news-003/ - "Works by Dermott native accepted by Arts Center" - Thur.

===The Dermott Series===
In early 1996 Alexander finished and released his popular "Dermott Series", a 20 piece collection of oil and acrylic paintings that offered a nostalgic look back at his childhood of growing up in rural southeast [[Arkansas]]. The paintings feature images of people, buildings, and sites of [[Dermott, Arkansas]], such as a cotton gin, his childhood house, where he went to school, and other images. Alexander said at the time that, "I did the Dermott Series for many personal reasons, and I'm overwhelmed by the response this collection is creating here in Texas". The series includes, "Birthplace", "Where I grew up", "Picking Cotton", "Cotton Gin", "Hot Grits", "In the kitchen with mama", and the old [[Chicot County]] High School, among others.&lt;ref&gt;[http://larrydalexander.netfirms.com/LarryD.Alexander-ArtfortheAges///home/users/web/b1499/nf.larrydalexander/public_html/LarryD.Alexander-ArtfortheAges//wp-content/uploads/2014/02/Larry%20D.%20Alexander%20News%20006.jpg - "Alexander paints series of Dermott" - Chicot County Spectator - May 1, 1996 - pg.7]&lt;/ref&gt;

===The Detroit Series===
In 1999 Alexander unveiled his "Detroit Series", a series of [[oil]] and [[acrylic paint|acrylic]] paintings of various sites in [[Detroit]], [[Michigan]] at the American Black Artist Institute on [[West Grand Boulevard]] in [[Detroit]]. The nine piece series includes paintings on [[Belle Isle Park]], the [[Detroit skyline]], the [[Detroit River]], [[Hitsville USA]] (the original home for [[Motown Records]]), [[Greektown Historic District]], the old [[Tiger Stadium (Detroit)]], the old [[J.L. Hudson]] building, former mayor [[Coleman A. Young]], and many more.&lt;ref&gt;[http://larrydalexander.netfirms.com/LarryD.Alexander-ArtfortheAges///home/users/web/b1499/nf.larrydalexander/public_html/LarryD.Alexander-ArtfortheAges//wp-content/uploads/2014/02/Larry%20D.%20Alexander%20News%20012.jpg - "Alexander unveils his "Detroit Series"]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://blogs.metrotimes.com/news-blawg/happy-birthday-larry-d-alexander/ - Detroit Metro Times - "Happy Birthday Larry D.

===The Delta Series===
[[File:The Artwork of Larry D. Alexander 004.jpg|thumb|"Aunt Eira Mae", an Acrylic painting by Larry D. Alexander - [[The African American Museum (Dallas, Texas)]] - 2004]]

In May 1998 Alexander unveiled his "Delta Series, which was painted entirely with acrylics, during "[[the Arkansas Schools Tours]]". The tour was expanded that year to include stops in [[Greenville, Mississippi]] and [[Memphis, Tennessee]]. This series included paintings of the [[Mississippi Alluvial Plain]] region from [[Monroe, Louisiana]] to Memphis. It includes a painting of [[Graceland]], [[Elvis Presley]]'s former home, the landmark Greenville Courthouse in Greenville, a perspective of [[Beale Street]] in Memphis, and his classic rendition of a "Cotton Farm" among others.&lt;ref&gt;[http://larrydalexander.netfirms.com/LarryD.Alexander-ArtfortheAges///home/users/web/b1499/nf.larrydalexander/public_html/LarryD.Alexander-ArtfortheAges//wp-content/uploads/2014/02/Larry%20D.%20Alexander%20News%20014.jpg - Pine Bluff Commercial - "Artist announces plan for "Arkansas Tour" - May, 1998]&lt;/ref&gt; Another piece from the Delta Series, "Aunt Eira Mae" was donated to the permanent collection of [[The African American Museum (Dallas, Texas)]] in 2004.

===The Series of P.A.T.R.I.C.E===
Alexander has also donated work to art departments of schools and colleges. In October 1996 at halftime at the inaugural football game, billed as the "[[Mobil]] Gridiron Classic", at [[Texas Stadium]] in [[Irving, Texas]], Alexander presented a piece from one of his series, "The series of P.A.T.R.I.C.E", to the president, and the chancellor, of the participating colleges, respectively, [[Texas Southern University]] and the [[University of Arkansas at Pine Bluff]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://larrydalexander.netfirms.com/LarryD.Alexander-ArtfortheAges///home/users/web/b1499/nf.larrydalexander/public_html/LarryD.Alexander-ArtfortheAges//wp-content/uploads/2014/02/Larry%20D.%20Alexander%20News%20019.jpg - Pine Bluff Commercial - "Around and about" - Sun. October 27, 1996]&lt;/ref&gt;

===The Sixties Series===
Alexander's most popular [[Pen and Ink]] art series, "The Sixties Series" has been exhibited in schools, libraries, and art institutions in several places since it was completed in 1993. It consists of elaborate drawings of well known figures and events of the 1960s, such as the civil rights [[Selma to Montgomery marches]] of 1965, and portraits of [[Martin Luther King Jr.]], [[Lyndon Johnson]], [[Malcolm X]], [[Medgar Evers]], and [[Rosa Parks]]. This series also covers the [[Vietnam War]].

The theme pieces in the collection are a piece called "Composite Sixties", and one called "Composite Protests", which make up a composite of people, places and events that were prominent in the 1960s. For example, they show images of [[John F. Kennedy]], [[Lyndon Johnson]], and [[Richard M. Nixon]], the [[United States]] presidents who served during the sixties, also [[J. Edgar Hoover]], [[Jackie Kennedy]], [[Ted Kennedy]], [[Robert F. Kennedy]], an image of U.S. astronauts landing on the moon in 1969, and many of the [[Americans|American]] protests that took place during this turbulent decade, to name a few.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thelarrydalexander.com/LARRYDALEXANDER/larry-d-alexander-in-the-news/larry-d-alexander-in-the-news-001/ - Pine Bluff Commercial - "Crawfish Festival brings Dermott native back home" - Fri. May 18, 2001]&lt;/ref&gt;

==African-American history book==
In 2001, Alexander finished his first book called ''African-American History at a Glance'', which also included several [[pen and ink]] drawings of [[African-Americans]] who have contributed substantially to the [[Americans|American]] success story. "There is a lack of input regarding [[African-Americans]] in the [[American history]] curriculum of schools all over [[United States|America]]" Mr. Alexander says. "There are a lot of schools that offer it as a choice to students, but I think it should be a part of regular [[American history]]".

Alexander's book was used to help create a supplemental text, that was later put together by the [[Irving Independent School District]] to help improve the [[American history]] curriculum in the high schools of [[Irving, Texas]] in 2002. His book deliberately ignores the contributions of [[African-Americans]] in the areas of sports and entertainment, as he feels they are already too well known and over-emphasized in society.

==The Arkansas School Tours==
Alexander and his cousin Lawrence "Larry" Crockett, both natives of [[Dermott, Arkansas]] put together the first "Arkansas schools tour" in 1996, and in May of that year, visited ten schools in seven cities in four days. Crockett and his son, B.J., both traveled with Alexander on the initial tour, while they were on a one-week break from the tour of the [[Rodgers and Hammerstein]] [[Broadway musical]] ''[[Carousel (musical)|Carousel]]'', which B.J. had a role in at the time. After the first year however, the tour was continued on by Alexander alone through 2007. Alexander says he wanted to give back to his home state of Arkansas and be a blessing to the children who live there, and, because of the success of the first tour in 1996, Alexander decided to continue doing it once annually for the next ten years. Its major objective was to instill hope and encouragement in the children of Arkansas, and to aid them in making good choices during the developing stages of life. These annual visits to [[high schools]], [[middle schools]], and [[elementary schools]], were also conducted to instruct and encourage children in pursuing their goals and careers in the [[visual arts]], as well as other areas, and to stay away from [[illegal drugs]]. It was during the second tour in 1997 that Alexander incorporated his anti-drug slogan "Eradicate Drug Use Common Among Teens Everywhere" (EDUCATE). Alexander usually ended his tour with a two-day art exhibit and print signing at the [[Dermott, Arkansas]] [[Crawfish]] Festival.&lt;ref&gt;[http://larrydalexander.netfirms.com/LarryD.Alexander-ArtfortheAges///home/users/web/b1499/nf.larrydalexander/public_html/LarryD.Alexander-ArtfortheAges//wp-content/uploads/2014/02/Larry%20D.%20Alexander%20News%20028.jpg The McGehee Times/Dermott News - "Alexander to present artwork at Crawfish Festival" - Wed.

{{quote box |quote = It seems as if God has placed a hunger and thirst inside of each of us, innately from birth, and the only way to satisfy that hunger or thirst is by seeking and ultimately finding Him.

[[File:Mary Delany (née Granville) by John Opie.jpg|thumb|upright|Portrait of Mary Delany by [[John Opie]], 1782.]]

'''Mary A Delany''' (née '''Granville''') (14 May 1700 – 15 April 1788) was an English artist, letter-writer, and [[Blue Stockings Society (England)|Bluestocking]], equally famous for her "paper-mosaicks" and her lively correspondence.

==Early life==
Mary Delany was born at [[Coulston]], Wiltshire, the daughter of Colonel Bernard Granville by his marriage to Mary Westcombe, loyal [[Tory]] supporters of the [[House of Stuart|Stuart Crown]]. She was also a niece of [[George Granville, 1st Baron Lansdowne]], her father's brother.  Mary had one older brother, Bernard (1699), known as Bunny; a younger brother Bevil, born between 1702 and 1706, and a sister, Anne (1707).&lt;ref&gt;M. Peacock, 'Mrs Delany begins her life's work' in ''The Paper Garden'' (2010) beginning at p. 72; Dewes ( 1940)&lt;/ref&gt; When Mary was young, her parents moved the family to London, and Mary attended a school taught by a French refugee, Mademoiselle Puelle. Mary came into close contact with the Court when she was sent to live with her aunt, Lady Stanley, who was childless&lt;ref&gt;Dewes 1940, p. 20.&lt;/ref&gt; the intention being that she would eventually become a [[Maid of Honour]].&lt;ref name="hayden"&gt;Hayden, 1980.&lt;/ref&gt;

While living with Lady Stanley, Mary became learned in, "English, French, history, music, needlework and dancing..."&lt;ref name="hayden" /&gt; Mary came in contact with [[Handel]] while at the household, listening to music he had composed; this contact with Handel would stay with Mary for the rest of her life; she was a close personal friend and loyal supporter of the composer.&lt;ref&gt;Dewes 1940, p. 22.&lt;/ref&gt; Mary's plans to become a [[lady in waiting]] were ruined by [[Anne, Queen of Great Britain|Queen Anne]]'s death in 1714, which led to a change in power, and a [[House of Hanover|Hanoverian]] on the throne, supported by the [[Whig (British political party)|Whig]]s.  The Granvilles moved to a manor at [[Buckland, Gloucestershire|Buckland in Gloucestershire]], where they were quite isolated from English society.  However, Mary was able to continue her education and her pursuit of paper cutting, which had developed at an early age.&lt;ref name="hayden" /&gt;

Near the end of 1717 Mary was invited to stay with her uncle, Lord Lansdowne, in [[Wiltshire]].  She was introduced to [[Alexander Pendarves]] during this stay, and it soon became clear that her family had an interest in a marriage between the two.  Pendarves was Member of Parliament for [[Launceston (UK Parliament constituency)|Launceston]] and 60 years old, whereas Mary was just 17.  In February 1718 she was unhappily married to him, a marriage brought on by her parents' financial dependence on Lord Lansdowne, and Lord Lansdowne's hope to have political influence through the nuptials.&lt;ref name="hayden" /&gt;

==Married life==

The Pendarveses left for [[Roscrow Castle]] near [[Falmouth, Cornwall|Falmouth]] in west [[Cornwall]] in April; once settled, Mrs Pendarves was able to enjoy the great views that Roscrow offered, and was able to get in quite a bit of riding.  Mr Pendarves's [[gout]] grew worse as the year progressed, and in the second year of their marriage, Mrs Pendarves was forced to nurse her ailing husband.  In 1721, the two took a house in London and there, though Mr Pendarves began to drink excessively, Mrs Pendarves was able to be reunited with many of her old friends.  In 1724, Mr Pendarves died suddenly in his sleep, leaving his young wife a widow.&lt;ref name="hayden" /&gt; Mr Pendarves had not altered his will after his marriage, and so Mrs Pendarves did not inherit what remained of his estate. "Mr. Pendarves, concerned with the bottle that allowed him to forget the loss of part of his fortune, had had no time to consider settling the rest of it on his wife."&lt;ref&gt;Dewes 1940, p. 79.&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite her lack of resources, widowhood provided new opportunities for Mrs Pendarves.  Widows, unlike unmarried women, were able to move freely in society, and for the first time in her life, Mrs Pendarves was able to pursue her own interests without the oversight of any man.  Perhaps because of her own unhappy marriage, she was not satisfied with the options available to women in the 18th century. She wrote, {{quote|Why must women be ''driven to the necessity'' of marrying?  a state that should always be a matter of ''choice''!  and if a young woman has not fortune sufficient to maintain her in the situation she has been bred to, what can she do, but marry?"&lt;ref name="hayden" /&gt;}}  Mrs Pendarves was a very perceptive woman, "She judged everything and everybody for herself; and, while ridiculing all empty-headed or vain insipidity, whether fashionable or eccentric, was always ready to applaud the unusual, if sincere and worthy.  She was eager in the acquisition of knowledge of all kinds to the end of her life..."&lt;ref&gt;Johnson, R. Brimley. ''Mrs. Delany'' (London: Stanley Paul &amp; Co. Ltd. 1925) p. xxiv.&lt;/ref&gt;

Because she had no home of her own, after her first husband's death, Mrs Pendarves spent time living with various relatives and friends. To begin with, she lived with her aunt and uncle Stanley, and after her aunt's death, she spent time in Ireland with the family of her friend Mrs Donellan.  In Ireland, Mrs Pendarves made the acquaintance of [[Patrick Delany (theologian)|Dr Patrick Delany]], an Irish clergyman who was already married to a rich widow. It was not until 1743, two years after the death of his first wife, that on a trip to London Dr Delany proposed to Mrs Pendarves, much to the dismay of her family.  She chose to take Dr Delany as her husband, and the two were married in June 1743.&lt;ref name="hayden" /&gt;

The Delanys passed a year in London before moving to [[Dublin]], where Dr Delany had a home. They also rented [[Mount Panther]] in [[County Down]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last= Kingsley |first=Nicholas |title=Annesley of Castlewellan, Mount Panther and Donard Lodge, Earls Annesley |publisher=Landed families of Britain and Ireland |date=14 November 2014 |url=https://landedfamilies.blogspot.com/2014/11/147-annesley-of-castlewellan-mount.html |accessdate=24 June 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and during their first year in the house Patrick was made [[Dean of Down]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Cotton |first=Henry |authorlink=Henry Cotton (divine) |title=Fasti Ecclesiæ Hibernicæ: The Succession of the Prelates and Members of the Cathedral Bodies in Ireland: Volume 3 |publisher=Hodges and Smith |year=1849 |location=Dublin |pages=228 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Y-cpW80vLPcC&amp;hl=fr&amp;pg=PA228 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Both husband and wife were very interested in botany and gardening: {{quote|"Their mutual pleasure in their garden at Delville near Dublin in particular, his encouragement of her gardening, painting, shell-work and needlework resulted in a surge of activity in a variety of media in all of which the basic theme was the flower, whether in stocking the Delville garden, painting garden landscapes, decorating interiors with shells, or working embroideries."&lt;ref&gt;Hayden 1980, p. 12.&lt;/ref&gt;}}  After twenty-five years of marriage, most of it spent in Ireland, Dr Delany died in Bath, England, on 6 May 1768 at the age of eighty-four, and Mrs Delany, now sixty-eight, found herself, once again, a widow.&lt;ref&gt;Paston, George. ''Mrs. Delany (Mary Granville): a memoir, 1700–1788'' (Edinburgh: G. Richards, 1900) p. 191.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Later life==

As a widow, Mary Delany spent even more of her time at [[Bulstrode Park|Bulstrode]], the home of her close friend, [[Margaret Bentinck, Duchess of Portland|Margaret Bentinck, Dowager Duchess of Portland]]. The two shared a kinship in botany, often going out to look for specific specimens.  It was during her frequent stays at [[Bulstrode Park|Bulstrode]] with the Duchess that Mary became acquainted with two well-known botanists of the time [[Joseph Banks]] and [[Daniel Solander]].  This contact with the botanists only encouraged Mary's interest in botany and also encouraged the knowledge on which many of her flower paper-cuttings are based.&lt;ref name="hayden" /&gt;

==Career as an artist==

Mary Delany had always been an artist, but during her marriage to Dr Delany she had the time to hone her skills.  She was also a gardener, and did needlework, drawing, and painting; but was best known for her paper-cutting:

&lt;blockquote&gt;"For these 'mosaicks' are coloured paper representing not only conspicuous details but also contrasting colours or shades of the same colour so that every effect of light is caught".&lt;ref&gt;Hayden 1980, p. 13.&lt;/ref&gt; She struck up a friendship with [[Letitia Bushe]], a watercolourist and miniaturist, with whom she embarked on a number of artistic projects.&lt;ref name=Connolly&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Connolly|first1=S. J.|title=A Woman's Life in Mid-Eighteenth-Century Ireland: The Case of Letitia Bushe|journal=The Historical Journal|date=2000|volume=43|issue=2|pages=433–451|jstor=3021036}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In 1771, a widow in her early 70s, Mary began on [[decoupage]], a fashion with ladies of the court. Her works were detailed and botanically accurate depictions of plants.  She used [[tissue paper]] and hand colouration to produce these pieces. She created 985 of these works, calling them her "Paper Mosaiks {{sic}}",&lt;ref&gt;Laird 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; from the age of 71 to 88, when her eyesight failed her.&lt;ref&gt;Laird 2009, p. 36.&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;"With the plant specimen set before her she cut minute particles of coloured paper to represent the petals, stamens, calyx, leaves, veins, stalk and other parts of the plant, and, using lighter and darker paper to form the shading, she stuck them on a black background.  By placing one piece of paper upon another she sometimes built up several layers and in a complete picture there might be hundreds of pieces to form one plant.  It is thought she first dissected each plant so that she might examine it carefully for accurate portrayal..."&lt;ref&gt;Hayden 1980, pp. 132–133.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Mary became well known, and donors began to send her flowers to cut.&lt;ref&gt;Hayden 1980, p. 143.&lt;/ref&gt; They can still be seen in the [[King's Library#Enlightenment exhibition|Enlightenment Gallery]] at the [[British Museum]] today.  Upon her death, "The ten volumes of Mrs. Delany's ''Flora'' were inherited by Lady Llanover, the daughter of Georgina Mary Ann Port.  Lady Llanover, who died in 1896 at the age of ninety-four, bequeathed these volumes to the British Museum..."&lt;ref&gt;Vulliamy 1935, p. 256.&lt;/ref&gt;

When her patroness, the Dowager Duchess, died, [[King George III]] and [[Queen Charlotte]] gave her a small house at [[Windsor, Berkshire|Windsor]] and a pension of 300 pounds a year.  Mrs. Delany had become familiar with Queen Charlotte while living in the house at Windsor, becoming an important part of the inner circle of the court.&lt;ref name="hayden" /&gt; The King and Queen, great supporters of her paper-cutting, "...always desired that any curious or beautiful plants should be transmitted to Mrs. Delany when in blossom."&lt;ref&gt;Vulliamy 1935, p. 254.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Frances Burney]] (Madame D'Arblay) was introduced to her in 1783, and frequently visited her at her London home and at Windsor, and owed to her friendship her court appointment. Delany, in her eighties at this time, had a reputation for cutting out and making the intricate paper mosaics ([[collage]]s) now in the [[British Museum]]. She had known many of the luminaries of her day, had corresponded with [[Jonathan Swift]], [[Sir Joseph Banks]], and Young, and left a detailed picture of polite English society of the 18th century in her six volumes of ''Autobiography and Letters'' (ed. [[Lady Llanover]], 1861–1862). [[Edmund Burke|Burke]] calls her "a real fine lady, the model of an accomplished woman of former times".

In 1980, a descendant of Mary Delany's sister Anne, Ruth Hayden, published a book on Delany's work: ''Mrs. Delany and Her Flower Collages'', which was reissued in 2000 as ''Mrs. Delany: Her Life and Her Flowers'' (British Museum Press).

The [[Ulster Museum]] in Belfast holds an embroidered bedcover by Mrs Delaney, one of the only complete pieces of embroidery made by her.

'''Mindy Alper''' (born 1959) is an American artist who lives in [[Greater Los Angeles]]. Her drawings, paintings, and sculptures focus on the [[Representation (arts)|representation]] of people, either in portraiture or as figures who embody aspects of her inner experience. She has been praised for her ability to articulate complex and profound emotion in her work. Among her [[art media]] are paint (oil and acrylic), ink, [[marker pen]], [[papier-mâché]], clay, and wood. She was a [[performance artist]] in the 1980s, and she plays guitar and violin.

Alper is the subject of the documentary film ''[[Heaven Is a Traffic Jam on the 405]]'' (2016), which won the [[Academy Award for Best Documentary (Short Subject)]] in 2018.

==Early life and education==
Alper was born into a Jewish family in [[Brooklyn]], New York in 1959; she was the second of four children, and the only girl.&lt;ref name="McKenna"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1992-10-18/entertainment/ca-650_1_mindy-alper/|work=Los Angeles Times |last=McKenna |first=Kristine |authorlink=Kristine McKenna |date=October 18, 1992 |title=Inside the Outsider: Artist Mindy Alper reveals the dark paths of her mind through the compulsiveness of her imaginative drawings |access-date=March 11, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://jewishjournal.com/culture/arts/229826/stop-youve-heard-one/ |title=Film Reveals Woman’s Struggles for Her Art |last=Pfefferman |first=Naomi |date=January 17, 2018 |website=[[The Jewish Journal of Greater Los Angeles]] |access-date=May 31, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; When she was age two, her family moved to Los Angeles, where she has lived ever since.&lt;ref name="McKenna"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://heavenisatrafficjamonthe405.com/bio/ |title=Mindy's Bio |website=HeavenIsATrafficJamOnThe405.com |access-date=March 5, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a child, Alper had a [[phobia]] of touching others and of being touched, for fear that her touch was poisonous.{{sfn|Stiefel|2016|loc=3:11}} By age four or five, she was drawing prolifically, and she found that drawing relieved her anxiety.&lt;ref name="McKenna"/&gt;{{sfn|Stiefel|2016|loc=8:34}}

Alper's parents hired [[visual artist]] Dorothy Cannon to tutor her in art.&lt;ref name="McKenna"/&gt;&lt;ref name="deadline"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://deadline.com/2017/11/heaven-is-a-traffic-jam-mindy-alper-frank-stiefel-oscars-academy-awards-documentary-interview-1202212537/ |title=''Heaven Is a Traffic Jam'' Director on Doc Subject Mindy Alper: 'She’s the most human of us humans' |last=Carey |first=Matthew |date=November 20, 2017 |website=[[Deadline Hollywood]] |access-date=March 5, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The lessons were in Cannon's home: a creatively decorated and inspiring place filled with music. For her students, Cannon read aloud [[nonsense verse]] by [[Lewis Carroll]] and [[Edward Lear]].&lt;ref name="McKenna"/&gt; She worked with a variety of [[Art media|media]], and introduced Alper to [[papier-mâché]] (a medium Alper was still using 50 years later).{{sfn|Stiefel|2016|loc=9:51}} They made a mask together, and Alper continued making masks until she shifted her subject to people and the human form.&lt;ref name="McKenna"/&gt;

Alper later attended an [[alternative school]] in [[Highland Park, Los Angeles|Highland Park]]. In 1974, she began to learn puppet-making from marionettist [[Harry Burnett]].&lt;ref name="McKenna" /&gt;&lt;ref name="artnet"/&gt; Burnett, who was then in his mid-seventies, was spending his winter years teaching such skills to children, the elderly, and the disabled.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1993/06/01/obituaries/harry-burnett-master-of-puppetry-dies-at-92.html |title=Harry Burnett, Master of Puppetry, Dies at 92 |author=&lt;!-- no byline --&gt; |date=June 1, 1993 |newspaper=The New York Times |access-date=March 5, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; "I made really intricate [[marionette]]s that took me months to finish," Alper recalls. "I wanted to have control over something and I had control of my marionettes—but, oddly enough, I never played with them. I always gave them away shortly after I finished them."&lt;ref name="McKenna"/&gt;

In 1976, Alper enrolled at [[Immaculate Heart College]], a Catholic private college in Los Angeles, but she was distressed by the way the nuns treated her.&lt;ref name="artnet"/&gt; In 1978 she transferred to [[Los Angeles City College]], where she continued her education in art until 1983.&lt;ref name="artnet"/&gt;&lt;ref name="RFG-bio"/&gt; In the mid-1980s, when Alper was 27, she suffered a [[mental breakdown]] and lost the ability to speak, write, or think in words.{{sfn|Stiefel|2016|loc=21:44}} Eventually she was able to communicate by rearranging pre-printed words. In 1994, faced with crippling depression, Alper opted for [[electroconvulsive therapy]], which left her with some parts of her brain permanently damaged.{{sfn|Stiefel|2016|loc=23:53}}

Through all the changes in her life, Alper remained close to her first art teacher, Cannon, until Cannon's death in 1999.&lt;ref name="artnet"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.artnet.com/artists/mindy-alper/biography |title=Mindy Alper Biography |website=[[Artnet]] |access-date=March 5, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.dorothycannon.com/cannon-bio.htm |title=Dorothy Cannon |last=Hosler |first=Jay |date=May 19, 2014 |orig-year=2007 |website=DorothyCannon.com |access-date=March 5, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; When Cannon died, Alper was at her bedside holding her hand.{{sfn|Stiefel|2016|loc=10:15}} Some years later, she studied with painter and professor Susanna Maing of [[Occidental College]].&lt;ref name="RFG-bio"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.oxy.edu/faculty/susanna-maing |title=Faculty: Susanna Maing |website=Oxy.edu |publisher=[[Occidental College]] |access-date=March 5, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; She also approached Bolivian-American painter Tom Wudl.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.huffingtonpost.com/author/tom-wudl |title=Tom Wudl |website=[[HuffPost]] |access-date=March 5, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Alper had an upcoming show, and was feeling very anxious about it. She was also afraid that she had lost her creativity. "Tom promised me that we are [[creativity]] itself, and that he could help me find that in myself again," Alper said. Wudl invited her to study under him at no charge.{{sfn|Stiefel|2016|loc=10:48}} Since then, she has worked with Wudl for several years.

Among Alper's [[art media]] are [[Oil paint|oil]] and [[Acrylic paint|acrylic]] paint, papier-mâché, clay, ink, and marker pen. When she eventually tired of papier-mâché, she began to study [[wood carving]].&lt;ref name="Gottlieb"&gt;{{cite interview |url=https://www.documentary.org/online-feature/portrait-artist-heaven-traffic-jam-405 |title=A Portrait of an Artist: ''Heaven Is a Traffic Jam on the 405'' |last=Stiefel |first=Frank |authorlink=Frank Stiefel |interviewer=Akiva Gottlieb |date=February 26, 2018 |website=Documentary.org |publisher=International Documentary Association |access-date=March 5, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; She plays guitar and violin, and reports that all of her family members were musical. Her mother, she says, also aspired to be a painter, but hid her paintings from her children.&lt;ref name="McKenna"/&gt;

==Career==
===Teaching===
Alper taught alongside her mentor, Cannon, off and on from 1976 to 1995.&lt;ref name="RFG-bio"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.rosamundfelsen.com/attachment/en/56732acf6aa72cc67a11a515/TextTwoColumnsWithFile/56a2c7307bc1386353e1d7b1 |format=[[DOCX]] |title=Mindy Alper |year=2018 |publisher=[[Rosamund Felsen Gallery]] |access-date=March 5, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the late 1970s she was a [[teaching assistant]] at Area H Alternative School, one of the first [[alternative school]]s in Los Angeles.&lt;ref name="RFG-bio"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=First Alternative in L.A. Gets Final OK of Board |date=September 1, 1972 |newspaper=[[Los Angeles Times]] |url=http://www.classmates.com/places/school/Area-H-Alternative-High-School/19933 |via=[[Classmates.com]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1986 she taught art on a voluntary basis to [[terminally ill]] teenagers at [[Children's Hospital Los Angeles]].&lt;ref name="McKenna" /&gt;&lt;ref name="RFG-bio"/&gt;

It was around this time that she met Marc Sirinsky, who was directing a theatre group called Imagination Workshop. His wife, [[Catherine Coulson]] (the "[[Log Lady]]" of ''[[Twin Peaks]]'' fame), became one of her students, and also a good friend. "I got to know Mindy… when I came to have her help me draw a log, and we really connected," Coulson explains.&lt;ref name="McKenna" /&gt; During a period in 1992 when Alper lost the power of speech, Coulson acted as an intermediary to help her answer questions for an interview with [[Kristine McKenna]]. At the time of the interview, Sirinsky was working on a play intended to adapt Alper's drawings for the stage.&lt;ref name="McKenna" /&gt;

Susan Arnold, a [[film producer]] and [[casting director]], also met Alper through the Workshop. When she was producing ''[[Benny &amp; Joon]]'' (1993), she arranged for Alper to help [[Mary Stuart Masterson]] prepare for her role as a mentally ill young woman who falls in love with a [[mime artist]].&lt;ref name="McKenna" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://ew.com/article/1993/04/23/benny-joon/ |title=''Benny &amp; Joon'' |first=Owen |last=Gleiberman |date=April 23, 1993 |website=[[Entertainment Weekly]] |access-date=August 7, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Alper ceased giving private instruction in 2001. In 2006, she was a visiting artist at the [[California Institute of the Arts]], for the benefit of an experimental drawing class there.&lt;ref name="RFG-bio"/&gt;

===Exhibitions===
From 1982 to 1989, Alper was active in the theatre: first as a member of a [[performance art]] and comedy group called the Love Machine, and then with the Buttersticks, a performance art troupe that she co-founded.&lt;ref name="artnet"/&gt; In 1984, her papier-mâché work was featured in the journal ''Fiberarts''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine |magazine=Fiberarts |date=July 1984 |last=Saito |first=Shirley |title=Mindy Alper: Sculpting in Papier-Mâché |pages=18–19 |volume=11 |issue=4}}&lt;/ref&gt; She has exhibited her paintings and sculpture in several community venues around Los Angeles. After an exhibition at Random Gallery of [[Highland Park, Los Angeles|Highland Park]] in 1988, she returned for a [[Solo show (art exhibition)|solo show]] in 1994, called "Drawing on the Wrong Side of the Brain", followed by a few group shows in the late 1990s.&lt;ref name="artnet"/&gt; Among her other solo shows are Raddack Gallery in 1987, and Sincere Technologies Gallery of [[Oakland, California|Oakland]] in 1989.&lt;ref name="artnet"/&gt; [[Rosamund Felsen Gallery]] of Los Angeles, which has represented her since 2006, hosted shows for her in 2006, 2007, and 2013.&lt;ref name="artnet"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://news.artnet.com/art-world/5-things-to-know-about-the-amazing-outsider-art-doc-that-just-won-an-oscar-1236194 |title=5 Things to Know About the Inspiring Outsider Art Documentary That Just Won an Oscar |last=Rea |first=Naomi |date=March 5, 2018 |website=Artnet News |access-date=March 5, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 2006 and 2007 shows demonstrated Alper's drawings in ink and marker pen.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.rosamundfelsen.com/exhibitions/mindy-alper/selected-works?view=thumbnails |title=Mindy Alper, September 9 – October 7, 2006 |website=RosamundFelsen.com |publisher=Rosamund Felsen Gallery |access-date=May 31, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.rosamundfelsen.com/exhibitions/mindy-alper2/selected-works?view=thumbnails |title=October 13 – November 10, 2007 |website=RosamundFelsen.com |publisher=Rosamund Felsen Gallery |access-date=May 31, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2013, she exhibited alongside [[abstractionist]] painter Marcia Roberts.

==Content==
Alper's work is [[Representation (arts)|representational]]. While she sometimes paints or sculpts portraits, much of her output comprises [[Line art|line drawing]]s and paintings that are expressive of her emotional state, or which evidence the workings of [[the unconscious]]. Her figures are human (or [[humanoid]]), and sometimes [[anthropomorphic]]. Cannon recalled that, as a child, Alper had "an unusual capacity for dipping into her subconscious and doing drawings from that point of view"; she described Alper's memory as "photographic". Journalist and [[art curator]] [[Kristine McKenna]] esteemed Alper's work from early childhood as "remarkably sophisticated in their technical polish and psychological complexity".&lt;ref name="McKenna" /&gt; Writing in 2018, film critic [[Richard Brody]] was impressed by Alper's ability to capture powerful emotion and potent memories with such precision and sincerity. He found her portraits to be "brilliant [and] moving".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.newyorker.com/culture/richard-brody/two-standouts-among-the-2018-oscar-nominated-documentary-shorts |title=Two Standouts Among the 2018 Oscar-Nominated Documentary Shorts |last=Brody |first=Richard |authorlink=Richard Brody |date=March 3, 2018 |website=[[The New Yorker]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During a ten-year period when she lost the power of speech for long stretches, her work changed: "I was very prolific with my drawing," Alper says, "and I think that I was telling more complete stories—maybe because I so desperately was trying to communicate."{{sfn|Stiefel|2016|loc=23:23}}

==Documentary==
{{main|Heaven Is a Traffic Jam on the 405}}

While studying at Tom Wudl Studio in the 2010s, Alper caught the attention of B. J. Dockweiler, a fellow painter and classmate. Dockweiler was fascinated by Alper's work and disposition. Dockweiler's husband, [[Frank Stiefel]], was equally intrigued when he met Alper at a group show and saw some of her pieces. He talked with Alper occasionally, as they attended some of the same art openings.&lt;ref name="Bernstein"&gt;{{cite interview |url=https://nofilmschool.com/2018/03-Commercial%20Exec-Frank-Stiefel-Heaven-Traffic-Jam-405 |title=How a Commercial Exec Became an Oscar-Nominated Director… at 70 |interviewer=Paula Bernstein |last=Stiefel |first=Frank |date=March 1, 2018 |website=No Film School |publisher=NONETWORK |access-date=March 6, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; He asked if he could film her as she worked on one of her newest pieces: a monumental [[Bust (sculpture)|bust]] of her therapist, Shoshana Gerson.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://realscreen.com/2018/03/04/heaven-is-a-traffic-jam-on-the-405-takes-oscar-for-best-documentary-short/ |title=''Heaven is a Traffic Jam on the 405'' takes Oscar for best documentary short |author=&lt;!-- staff --&gt; |date=March 4, 2018 |website=Realscreen |access-date=March 6, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; After a few months of filming, Stiefel interviewed Alper on camera; five more interviews followed, and Alper's story emerged.&lt;ref name="Carey"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.dailynews.com/2018/02/19/valley-artist-featured-in-oscar-nominated-documentary-ponders-a-trip-to-the-academy-awards/ |title=Valley artist featured in Oscar-nominated documentary ponders a trip to the Academy Awards |last=Carey |first=Matthew |date=February 19, 2018 |website=[[Los Angeles Daily News]] |access-date=March 5, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Gottlieb"/&gt; The film, ''[[Heaven Is a Traffic Jam on the 405]]'', premiered at the [[Austin Film Festival]] in 2016, where it won the Jury Award and the Audience Award in the "Documentary Short" category.

'''''Morning at Grand Manan''''' is an [[oil painting]] by [[Alfred Thompson Bricher]]. It is part of the permanent collection at the [[Indianapolis Museum of Art]], and is currently on view in the Paine Early American Painting Gallery. 

==Description==

Painted along [[Grand Manan|Grand Manan Island]], a favorite vacation spot of the artist in [[New Brunswick]], Canada, Bricher painted the sunrise coming above the [[Atlantic Ocean]] in a tiny [[inlet]] on the coast.&lt;ref name=Catalog&gt;{{cite web|title=Morning at Grand Manan Catalog Entry|url=http://www.imamuseum.org/art/collections/artwork/morning-grand-manan-bricher-alfred-thompson#ext-text-1396|publisher=Indianapolis Museum of Art|accessdate=2 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Four sailing ships are clearly visible against the pink sky. On the left of the canvas, a sharp, rocky cliff face is seen, breaking up the composition. Bricher clearly depicts each wave rolling onto the beach in minute detail. The sun is positioned a little left of center of the canvas, but is the major focal point, drawing the eye in. Just like the Hudson River painters, Bricher hides his brushstrokes, as if to make the canvas disappear.

==Historical Information==

Alfred Thompson Bricher was part of the [[Luminism (American art style)|American Luminist]] movement, coming out of the [[Hudson River School]]. Much like the [[impressionism|Impressionists]], they were interested in the play of light in [[landscapes]], with Bricher himself being particularly interested in how light played against the ocean. Bricher, in particular, became famous for his [[seascapes]] and depicting the North Atlantic seaboard.&lt;ref name=Catalog /&gt; Bricher is considered the last important luminist painter. ''Morning at Grand Manan'' came at the height of his career, and displayed Bricher's acquisition of European aesthetics into his own paintings.&lt;ref name=Questroyal&gt;{{cite web|last=Abbott|first=William Tylee Ranney|title=Biography|url=http://www.questroyalfineart.com/artist/alfred-thompson-bricher|publisher=Questroyal Fine Art|accessdate=3 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

===Acquisition===

Bricher sold ''Morning at Grand Manan'' to the Vose Gallery in [[Boston]] in 1898. The Indianapolis Museum of Art purchased the painting in 1970 using the Martha Delzell Memorial Fund.

A '''music store''' or '''musical instrument store'''  is a retail business that sells [[musical instrument]]s and related equipment and accessories.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.referenceforbusiness.com/industries/Retail-Trade/Musical-Instrument-Stores.html&lt;/ref&gt; In United States and Canada, most music stores in the 2010s sell a range of electric instruments (e.g., electric guitars), [[instrument amplifier]]s (e.g., [[guitar amplifier]]s); electronic instruments (e.g., synthesizers); drum kits (including drums, [[cymbal]]s and percussion instruments) and acoustic classical, [[concert band]] and [[jazz]] musical instruments such as saxophones, trumpets and violins. In addition, stores typically sell (and sometimes rent) the [[sound reinforcement system]] and [[PA system]] gear used in live concert performances and the [[sound recording]] equipment used to record music, such as microphones and digital recorders.

In the 2010s, music stores can be "[[bricks and mortar]]" stores (either individual [[small business]]es or [[chain store]]s, which may be a regional or national chain); online musical instrument stores, which consist of a website describing the merchandise, various online payment systems, and shipping or delivery systems; or hybrid stores that have both "bricks and mortar" stores and an online store. Some "bricks and mortar" music stores also provide services for a fee, such as [[music lesson]]s, musical instrument repair and guitar amplifier repair.

==Products==
In the 2010s, general music stores typically carry a range of instruments used in [[popular music]] and [[traditional music]] such as the electric guitar, acoustic guitar, electric bass, [[guitar string]]s, [[instrument amplifier]]s ([[guitar amplifier]], [[bass amplifier]] and [[keyboard amplifier]]), [[effects unit|electronic effects]] (e.g., [[distortion (music)|distortion]] [[effects unit|pedals]]), [[electronic keyboard]]s (including [[digital piano]]s, [[stage piano]]s, [[clonewheel organ]]s and synthesizers), drum kit components, which include drums, [[cymbal]]s, drum and cymbal stands and drum accessories ([[drum stick]]s, drum heads, etc.) and percussion instruments (e.g., [[tambourine]], [[shaker]]s, etc.). Some stores carry other types of stringed instruments, such as [[mandolin]]s and [[ukulele]]s.

General music stores also typically carry [[sound reinforcement system]] gear such as [[microphone]]s, small-to mid-sized [[mixing console]]s designed for live sound, [[speaker enclosure]]s, [[PA system]]s, [[power amplifier]]s and mic stands and [[sound recording]] equipment such as studio microphones, recording-oriented mixing consoles, [[digital recording]] systems, [[digital audio workstation]]s and digital audio software (e.g., [[softsynth]]s, [[Software synthesizer|virtual instruments]], [[ProTools]], etc.).
[[File:Cascio Interstate Music SuperStore Acoustic Guitar Cabin.jpeg|thumb|right|200px|A selection of acoustic guitars at Cascio Interstate Music SuperStore.]]
General music stores often carry a range of music accessories used during [[rehearsal]]s and performances, such as [[metronome]]s, [[electronic tuner]]s, [[music stand]]s, stand lights and conducting batons.

General music stores may also sell [[brass instrument]]s (e.g., [[trombone]], trumpet, etc.), woodwind instruments ([[flute]], [[clarinet]], saxophone, etc.) and instruments from the violin family (violin, [[viola]], cello and [[double bass|bass]]), but there is usually a smaller selection of these instruments, as compared with the guitar, bass and drum sections.

Some music stores also sell [[sheet music]], including [[popular music]], [[traditional music]] and [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] songs, [[movie soundtrack]] scores, classical music pieces and instrument methods and studies ("etudes"). In the 2010s, some stores also sell instructional music DVDs and play-along CDs, which typically contain sheet music with the written melodies, which the performer can play or sing while a recording of each song or piece's [[accompaniment]] plays on a CD player.

===Services===
Some music stores also provide services to customers for a fee, such as instrument maintenance and repair, amplifier and sound gear repairs, and/or [[music lesson]]s. Some music stores rent guitars, basses, amplifiers, [[stage piano]]s and [[PA system]] equipment.

==Specialized stores==

Larger cities may have a large enough population to support both general music stores and specialized music stores. Music stores in smaller towns tend to be general music stores, because there is not enough of a customer base to support specialized music stores. In the 2010s, general music stores have had to face competition from online music stores, which offer a huge selection of instruments and equipment.

===Electric guitars===

Electric guitars started appearing in the 1930&lt;nowiki/&gt;s and are one of the most popular [[musical instrument]]s to buy from a music store. Electric guitars can be heard in all types of music from pop, rock, [[blues]], [[jazz]], [[Heavy metal music|heavy metal]], [[funk]], [[Hip hop music|hip hop]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.gak.co.uk/en/electric-guitars|title=Electric Guitars {{!}} Shop Electric Guitars {{!}} GAK|website=www.gak.co.uk|access-date=28 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mainstream electric guitars stores sell well-known brands like [[Gibson Guitar Corporation|Gibson]], [[Fender Musical Instruments Corporation|Fender]] and [[Ibanez]]. Most guitar stores sell [[6-string guitar|six-string]] models, bass guitars, [[left handed guitar]]s and electric guitar packages for beginners, which typically include a budget-priced electric guitar, a small practice amplifier, a strap and picks.

''Guitar World'' magazine states that since guitar stores require patrons to try out guitars and amplifiers in the premises, some guitar players are nervous about playing in front of the store staff and other patrons.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.guitarworld.com/artist-news-viral-videos/dont-be-nervous-play-guitar-store/31147 |title=Don't Be Nervous to Play in a Guitar Store |last=Larson |first=Tyler|date=September 5, 2017 |website=''guitarworld.com'' |publisher=Guitar World |access-date=September 4, 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The columnist, Tyler Larson, states that apart from playing too loud, which is avoided, patrons should feel confident to test out the guitars and amplifiers in the guitar stores, because "...real musicians never look down on anybody for being at a different skill level".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.guitarworld.com/artist-news-viral-videos/dont-be-nervous-play-guitar-store/31147 |title=Don't Be Nervous to Play in a Guitar Store |last=Larson |first=Tyler|date=September 5, 2017 |website=''guitarworld.com'' |publisher=Guitar World |access-date=September 4, 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A [[University Press of Kentucky]] book on [[women in music]] states that customers did not treat a woman who worked at a guitar store like she knew anything about guitars until she would use special guitar terms.&lt;ref&gt;Carson, Mina; Lewis, Tina; Shaw, Susan M. ''Girls Rock! Fifty Years of Women Making Music''. University Press of Kentucky. p. 19&lt;/ref&gt; Indie folk singer-songwriter/guitarist [[Ani di Franco]] states that for women, in the past, even entering a guitar store was an "act of courage" because it felt like a "boys' club".&lt;ref&gt;Carson, Mina; Lewis, Tina; Shaw, Susan M. ''Girls Rock! Fifty Years of Women Making Music''. University Press of Kentucky. p. 19&lt;/ref&gt;

===Piano===
[[File:1905 - H S Schultz Piano Store Interior.jpg|thumb|right|200px|The H.S. Schultz Piano Store in 1905.]]
One common specialty store is the piano store, which typically sells a range of [[upright piano]]s and [[grand piano]]s. In the 2010s, some piano shops also sell grand pianos equipped with a digital [[player piano]] mechanism that can play back a recorded performance by activating the hammers. In the 2010s, some piano stores sell high-end [[digital piano]]s.

In 2015, ''The Guardian'' reported that in the US, piano stores have been closing, "...as kids snub lessons for other activities" such as amateur sports, as people taking piano lessons opt for much less costly "electronic keyboards or used pianos" and as children in the 2010s shift their interests away from traditional activities like piano lessons and towards newer computer-oriented activities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/jan/02/piano-stores-closing-kids-snub-lessons-compete-technology |title=Piano stores closing across US as kids snub lessons for other activities |author=&lt;!--Not stated--&gt; |date=January 2, 2015 |work= The Guardian|access-date=September 4, 2017 |quote=When Jim Foster opened his piano store 30 years ago, he had 10 competitors selling just pianos. When he closed Foster Family Music in late December, not one was still selling pianos in the Quad-Cities area of Iowa and Illinois. "We did try hard to find a buyer," Foster said. There were no takers. Stores dedicated to selling pianos like Foster's are dwindling across the country as fewer people take up the instrument and those who do often opt for a less expensive electronic keyboard or a used piano. Some blame computers and others note the high cost of new pianos, but what's clear is that a long-term decline in sales has accelerated. The best year for new piano sales in the US was 1909, when more than 364,500 were sold. But after gently falling over the years, piano sales have plunged more recently to between 30,000 and 40,000 annually.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another challenge for piano stores selling new instruments is that there are piano technicians who repair good-quality used pianos and sell them at much less than the cost of a new instrument.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/jan/02/piano-stores-closing-kids-snub-lessons-compete-technology |title=Piano stores closing across US as kids snub lessons for other activities |author=&lt;!--Not stated--&gt; |date=January 2, 2015 |work= The Guardian|access-date=September 4, 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Some piano stores offer rental of new pianos; as well, some piano stores sell used pianos.&lt;ref&gt;Miller, Neil. ''The Piano Lessons Book''. December 8, 2007. {{ISBN|978-1-4348-1853-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2015, it was reported that historic Detroit piano stores were closing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.axs.com/detroit-piano-stores-closing-amid-country-s-lack-of-interest-in-ebony--35842 |title=Detroit piano stores closing amid country's lack of interest in ebony and ivory |last=Ferro |first=Michael |date=January 5, 2015 |website=''axs.com'' |publisher=AXS.com |access-date=September 4, 2015 |quote=All across the country, there's a sad epidemic spreading much like the annual winter curse of the flu that sidelines scores of people each year. This sickness, though, is one of the heart, and of the soul, as many historic piano stores across the nation are closing their doors as interest in the once-immensely popular instrument fades in the modern era. It's no secret that pianos are becoming less and less popular in today's modern home, as reported by new statistics released this week. Nowhere is that more evident than in Detroit, with piano sales plummeting here in the Motor City. With so many homes in foreclosure and many other buildings, such as schools, dilapidated and awaiting to be torn down, pianos are a much more common sight to see backed away into the corner of a dusty garage or left behind after a hasty foreclosure from the bank. In short, pianos are a luxury that Detroiters simply seem to be able to no longer afford.}}&lt;/ref&gt; As well, in 2015, it was reported that "...US piano stores [are being] forced to close as recession, new technology [such as electronic keyboards] and cultural change take their toll."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/2015-03-15/piano-sales-plunge-in-united-states/6248428 |title=US piano stores forced to close as recession, new technology and cultural change take their toll |last=Millar |first=Lisa |date=March 15, 2015 |publisher=Australian Broadcasting Corporation |access-date=September 4, 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Another factor in the declining sales of pianos in the US is that pianos last a long time; high-quality, properly-maintained pianos can remain playable for 60 to 80 years after their original purchase.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/2015-03-15/piano-sales-plunge-in-united-states/6248428 |title=US piano stores forced to close as recession, new technology and cultural change take their toll |last=Millar |first=Lisa |date=March 15, 2015 |publisher=Australian Broadcasting Corporation |access-date=September 4, 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The high price of pianos is one factor that is causing the closing of piano stores: "A good grand piano from a respected name costs about as much as a luxury automobile", and as such, children (and their parents) are choosing less expensive instruments, such as electronic keyboards or stringed instruments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.timesfreepress.com/news/opinion/columns/story/2015/may/21/piano-stores-and-americeconomics/305469/ |title=Kennedy: Piano stores and American economics |last=Kennedy |first=Mark|website=''timesfreepress.com'' |publisher=Times Free Press |access-date=September 4, 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, in China, "piano sales are booming", with most of these piano sales being intended for home use; this rise in sales is in part because the costly instruments are viewed as a [[status symbol]] in China.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/2015-03-15/piano-sales-plunge-in-united-states/6248428 |title=US piano stores forced to close as recession, new technology and cultural change take their toll |last=Millar |first=Lisa |date=March 15, 2015 |publisher=Australian Broadcasting Corporation |access-date=September 4, 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the basement below the [[Steinway]] piano showroom in New York City, a selection of professional grand pianos are available, so that visiting piano performers playing a recital or doing a [[sound recording]] can select the instrument with their preferred sound.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2014/10/30/nyregion/steinway-piano-showroom-is-moving-to-a-new-home-in-midtown.html |title=Changing Keys, Steinway Piano Store Will Relocate in Midtown |last=Barron |first=John |date=October 29, 2014 |work=The New York Times |access-date=September 4, 2017 |quote=Steinway plans to use the space beneath the showroom the way it has long used the basement on 57th Street, as a destination for concert pianists who can try different instruments and choose one for their recitals or recording sessions.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Violin family===
Another specialty shop is the "violin shop", which, despite its name, often sells various violin family instruments (violin, viola, cello and often double bass, and the bows, strings, [[rosin]], chinrests, and other accessories used with these instruments). Violin shops are often operated by [[luthier]]s (violinmakers) who make violin family instruments and bows for sale. Luthiers also do maintenance and repairs on violin family instruments and bows.

According to ''PBS Newshour'', one US violinmaker who sells his instruments is combining his extensive knowledge of centuries-old violin-building techniques with 2010s-era technology such as "[[CT scan]]s" and "3D lasers", which are giving him new insights into his violin design and construction approaches.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.pbs.org/newshour/updates/violinmaker-uses-ct-scans-3d-lasers-hone-craft/ |title=Violinmaker uses CT scans, 3D lasers to hone craft |last=Kargbo |first=Connie |date=June 21, 2014 |website=''pbs.org'' |publisher=PBS Newshour |access-date=September 5, 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sheet music===
[[Sheet music]] stores sell printed classical music for songs, instrumental solo pieces, [[chamber music]], and scores for major symphonies and choral works, along with instrumental method books, "etudes" (studies) and graded musical exercises. Many sheet music stores also carry printed music songs for [[popular music]] genres such as rock, pop and musical theatre including individual songs and collections of songs grouped by artist, musical, or genre. Music for guitarists or electric bass players may be in [[tabulature]] notation, which depicts where on the instrument the performer should play a line. In the 2010s, sheet music stores often sell legal, copyright-compliant [[jazz]] [[fake book]]s. Sheet music stores often carry some practice accessories, such as [[metronome]]s, [[music stand]]s and [[tuning fork]]s.

===Other single category stores===
Specialized music stores that sell only guitars, only basses or only drums are more likely to be found in major cities. Guitar and bass-focused stores typically sell instruments and the amplifiers and [[effects unit|effects pedals]] used with these instruments.

===Pro audio===
{{Main|Professional audio store}}
Pro audio stores sell and in many cases, rent [[sound reinforcement system]] components, [[PA system]]s, [[microphone]]s and other audio gear. Some stores also rent "backline" musical gear, such as [[stage piano]]s and [[bass amp]]s.

===Organ stores===
Prior to the widespread availability of lightweight electronic [[clonewheel organ]]s in the 1980s and 1990s that emulate the sound of a heavy, electromechanical [[Hammond organ]], many cities had organ stores which sold large electric and electronic [[theatre organ]]s and [[spinet organ]]s made by Hammond, Lowrey and other manufacturers. These organs were sold for use in private homes and in churches; electric and electronic organs were popular for churches, because they cost significantly less than a [[pipe organ]].

==Used stores==
[[Image:Acoustic bass guitar 1.jpg|thumb|right|180px|A music store display showing an acoustic bass guitar and a variety of bass "combo" amplifiers and speaker cabinets.]]

Some music stores sell used, [[Vintage music equipment|vintage or collectible instruments and sound gear]], often using a [[consignment]] model, in which the store only pays the seller for her instrument when it is sold. Even though there has been a major shift towards the use of electronic and digital instruments and sound gear in the 2000s, there is still a strong interest in vintage instruments amongst musicians who play [[blues]], [[roots rock]], [[Americana (music)|Americana]] and [[indie rock]]. Vintage instruments that are sought out include 1950s and 1960s [[Hammond organ]]s, [[Fender Bassman]] amps and electric guitars, 1970s [[Fender Rhodes]] electric pianos and old analog effects, such as 1970s and 1980s [[stompbox]] pedals. Stores that mostly sell used equipment may also sell some new merchandise, such as new [[guitar string]]s, [[patch cord]]s and mic cables. Conversely, some stores that mostly sell new equipment may also sell some vintage, used equipment (typically a small number of high-priced collectible instruments).

==Online stores==
In the 2000s, some music stores sell their instruments and sound gear through a website that contains digital photos of the equipment, which are grouped into categories (e.g., electric guitars, amplifiers, PA gear). Each photo of a product is accompanied by the name and model number of each item, a description of each product's features and the price. The sophistication of online music stores varies. Some online music stores have a single photo of the item, the product name and price, and a few bullets about the features. On the other hand, some online music stores have interactive [[Web 2.0]] features, such as 360-degree [[virtual reality]]-style images of the products, in which the viewer can "turn" the product around to see the back and sides, online comments sections where customers can review their purchases and additional music-related content, such as articles on musical instruments or sound gear written by store staff. Patrons pay electronically at online music stores using a credit card, [[PayPal]] or other electronic payment systems. The goods are shipped through the mail or by express delivery companies such as [[FedEx]]. Some music stores sell their products solely online. In other cases, some stores operate both a "bricks and mortar" store (or chain) and an online store.

[[File:Nash, John (RA) - 'Over The Top'. 1st Artists' Rifles at Marcoing, 30th December 1917 - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|''Over The Top'', 1918, oil on canvas, by John Nash, [[Imperial War Museum]]]]

'''''Over The Top''''' is a 1918 [[oil-on-canvas]] painting by [[John Nash (artist)|John Nash]].  It depicts a counter-attack on [[Welsh Ridge]] in northern France on 30 December 1917, during the [[First World War]].    It is held by [[Imperial War Museum]], London.

The painting measures {{convert|79.8|xx|108|cm|in}}.  It shows British soldiers in heavy winter greatcoats scrambling up from their [[trench warfare|trenches]] to advance over a snow-covered landscape.  Two already lie dead or wounded on the [[duckboard]]s in the base of the trench and one on the snow.  The others move to the right without looking back.  Threatening clouds hang in the sky above, billowing darkly.  Two studies held by the Imperial War museum show the carefully balanced composition.

The painting is based on Nash's experience while serving in the 1st Battalion of the [[Artists' Rifles|Artists Rifles]] (28th [[London Regiment]]).  His unit went "[[wikt:over the top|over the top]]", to push towards [[Marcoing]] near [[Cambrai]]. Of the 80 men, 68 were killed or wounded by the shell-fire during the first few minutes. Nash was one of the 12 that survived.  He made the painting in early 1918, having returned to England and been recommended by his brother [[Paul Nash (artist)|Paul Nash]] to become an official [[war artist]].  The work was commissioned by the [[Ministry of Information (United Kingdom)|Ministry of Information]] and painted in a rented seed-shed at [[Chalfont St Peter]], Buckinghamshire.

'''Photoplay edition''' refers to movie tie-in [[book]]s of the [[silent film]] and early sound era at a time when [[motion pictures]] were known as "photoplays". Typically, photoplay editions were reprints of novels additionally illustrated with scenes from a film production. Less typically, photoplay editions were novelizations of films, where the film script was fictionalized in narrative form. Today, vintage photoplay editions are sought after by film buffs, bibliophiles, and collectors.

The first photoplay editions were published around 1912, and as a genre, they reached their height in the 1920s and 1930s. Thousands of different titles were issued in the United States. Most photoplays were published in hardback by companies like [[Grosset &amp; Dunlap]] or A.L. Burt, and some in soft cover by companies like Jacobsen Hodgkinson. Similar movie related books were also published in England, France and elsewhere.

Typically, photoplay editions of the 1920s and 1930s contained stills and/or a dust jacket featuring artwork or actors from a film. Deluxe editions might also contain a special binding, illustrated end papers, or rarely, a written introduction by the star of the film. Sometimes, the spine or cover of the book will note the edition is a "photoplay edition."

Illustrated movie tie-in books continued to be published though the 1940s, 1950s, and into the 1960s. Today, novels published in conjunction with the release of a film will often feature an actor or actress on the cover of the book, but without the interior illustrations.

Today, the most sought after photoplays are those tie-in editions for favorite films such as ''Dracula'', ''Frankenstein'' and ''King Kong'', or lost films such as ''London After Midnight''. Other collectors search for books featuring individuals stars, like [[Louise Brooks]] or [[Rudolph Valentino]]. Published by Grosset &amp; Dunlap in 1927, ''The General'' is today one of the most sought after of photoplay books. Not only did the Joseph Warren novel make its first appearance in print as a photoplay, but the book is the only photoplay edition to feature film star [[Buster Keaton]].

== Guidebooks ==

[[Image:Photoplayedition.jpg|thumb|170px|Emil Petaja's ''Photoplay Edition'' was the first book published on the subject.]]

''Photoplay Edition'' (SISU, 1975), by the noted science fiction and fantasy author [[Emil Petaja]], was the first book on the subject. Petaja based the book on his collection of photoplays, which at the time of publication numbered more than eight hundred. Petaja had owned many rare examples, including a few autographed by film stars.

Petaja's ''Photoplay Edition'' is composed of a checklist of books, with each entry detailing the book's movie title (which sometimes differed from the title of the novel), as well as its author, publisher, date of release, the motion picture company which produced the film, its leading actors, and the number of illustrations included within the book. Illustrating Petaja's guide are dozens of dust jackets and scene stills, each of which graced the original editions. Petaja also offers a short prologue, a longer history of photoplay books, and an anecdotal chapter telling the story of the author's involvement in collecting these books.

''Photoplay Edition'' has been surpassed by later, more comprehensive, illustrated guides. These include Arnie Davis' ''Photoplay Editions and Other Movie Tie-In Books'' (Mainely Books, 2002), and Rick Miller's ''Photoplay Editions: A Collector's Guide'' (McFarland, 2002). Each list more than the 800 examples found in Petaja's pioneering guide. Thomas Mann's ''Horror and Mystery Photoplay Editions and Magazine Fictionizations'' (McFarland, 2004) examines genre editions.

'''Raindance Foundation''' (RainDance Corporation) was founded in October 1969 by [[Frank Gillette]],&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/69486182|title=A history of video art : the development of form and function|last=Chris|first=Meigh-Andrews|date=2006-01-01|publisher=Berg|isbn=9781845202194|location=Oxford / New York|pages=62|oclc=69486182|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.radicalsoftware.org/e/history.html|title=Radical Software|website=www.radicalsoftware.org|access-date=2017-01-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Paul Ryan (video artist)|Paul Ryan, ]] [[Michael Shamberg]],&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Louis Jaffe,&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; and Marco Vassi.&lt;ref name=":1"/&gt; Raindance was a self-described "alternate culture think-tank" that embraced video as an alternative form of cultural communication.

The name "RainDance Corporation" was an ironic reference to the mainstream organization Rand Corporation.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1"/&gt; Influenced by the communications theories of [[Marshall McLuhan]] and [[Buckminster Fuller]], the collective produced a data bank of tapes and writings that explored the relation of [[cybernetics]], [[Media (communication)|media]], and [[ecology]]. From 1970 to 1974, Raindance published the seminal video journal ''[[Radical Software]]'' (initially edited by [[Beryl Korot]] and [[Phyllis Gershuny]]), which provided a network of communications for the emerging alternative video movement with a circulation of 5,000. In 1971, Dean and Dudley Evenson joined the Raindance Foundation and taught video workshops through the Metropolitan Museum of Art under a grant from the New York State Council on the Arts.  [[Dean Evenson]] was instrumental in hooking up the first half inch video transmission through New York City's Sterling Manhattan Cable, thus paving the way for Public Access Television. Dudley Evenson co-edited Issue #5 of Radical Software with Michael Shamberg. In 1971, Shamberg wrote ''Guerrilla Television'', a summary of the group's principles and a blueprint for the decentralization of television.&lt;ref name="Greenwald, Dara"&gt;[Dara Greenwald: The Process is in the Streets. Challenging Media America. S. 168-179. In: MacPhee and Reuland (eds.).Realizing the Impossible. Art Against Authority. Oakland, Edinburgh 2007.].&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1976, Raindance members [[Ira Schneider]] and [[Beryl Korot]] edited ''Video Art: An Anthology'', one of the first readers on [[video art]]. The original Raindance collective dispersed in the mid-1970s.

The nonprofit Raindance Foundation continued and in the 1980s produced the first comprehensive TV series on video art called "Night Light TV" which showcased video works by [[William Wegman (photographer)|William Wegman]], [[Ira Schneider]], [[Russ Johnson]] (of [[Taly and Russ Johnson]]), [[Joan Jonas]], [[Juan Downey]], John Sturgeon, and Willoughby Sharp. Raindance also administered [[The Standby Program]] at Matrix, bringing video editing to artists in the 1980s and 1990s.

{{refimprove|date=March 2017}}

A '''record chart''', also called a '''music chart''', is a ranking of [[Sound recording and reproduction|recorded music]] according to certain criteria during a given period of time. Many different criteria are used in different charts, including [[record sales]], the amount of radio [[airplay]], and since the popularity of the Internet for music, the number of [[music download|downloads]] and the amount of [[streaming media|streaming]] activity.

Some charts are specific to a particular [[musical genre]] and most to a particular geographical location (although download charts are not easily pinned down in this way). The most common period of time covered by a chart is one week with the chart being printed or broadcast at the end of this time. Summary charts for years and decades are then calculated from their component weekly charts. Component charts have become an increasingly important way to measure the commercial success of individual songs.

==Chart hit==
A ''chart hit'' is a recording, identified by its inclusion in a chart that uses sales or other criteria to rank popular releases, that ranks highly in popularity compared to other songs in the same time frame. ''Chart-topper'' and related terms (like ''number one'', ''No. 1 hit'', ''top of the charts'', ''chart hit'', and so forth) are widely used in common conversation and in marketing, and are loosely defined. Because of its value in promoting recording artists and releases, both directly to the consumer, and by encouraging exposure on radio, TV other media, chart positioning has long been a subject of scrutiny and controversy. Chart compilation methodology and data sources vary, ranging from "buzz charts" (based on opinions of various experts and [[:wiktionary:tastemaker|tastemaker]]s), to charts that reflect empirical data such as retail sales. Therefore, a ''chart-topper'' may be anything from an "insiders' pick" to a runaway seller. Most charts that are used to determine extant mainstream popularity rely on measurable data.

Record chart performance is inherently relative, as they rank songs, albums and records in comparison to each other at the same time, as opposed to [[music recording sales certification]] methods, which are measured in absolute numbers. Comparing the chart positions of songs at different times thus does not provide an accurate comparison of a song's overall impact. The nature of most charts, particularly weekly charts, also favors songs that sell very well for a brief period of time; thus, a song that is only briefly popular may chart higher than a song that sells more copies in the long range, but more slowly. As a result, a band's biggest hit single may not be its best-selling single.

According to [[Joel Whitburn]], the American trade publication ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' introduced the [[Billboard Hot 100|Hot 100]] on August 4, 1958.  This was the first chart in the US to "fully integrate the hottest-selling and most-played pop singles."&lt;ref name=whitburn&gt;{{cite book|first=Joel|last=Whitburn|year=2003|title=Top Pop Singles 1955-2002|edition= 1st|publisher=Record Research Inc.|location=Menomonee Falls, Wisconsin|isbn= 0-89820-155-1|page=xi-xiii}}&lt;/ref&gt;  From 1958 until 1991, ''Billboard'' compiled the chart from playlists reported by radio stations, and surveys of retail sales outlets.  Before 1958, several charts were published, including "Best Sellers in Stores", "Most Played by Jockeys" (later revived under the name [[Hot 100 Airplay]]), and "Most Played in Juke Boxes", and, in later collations of chart hits, the record's highest placing in any of those charts was usually reported.  On November 30, 1991, ''Billboard'' introduced a new method of determining the Hot 100, "by a combination of actual radio airplay monitored electronically by [[Nielsen Broadcast Data Systems]] (BDS), additional playlists from small-market stations, and actual point-of-sale information provided by Nielsen SoundScan."&lt;ref name=whitburn/&gt;  Until 1998, any songs placed on the chart had to be physically available as a [[single (record)|single]].&lt;ref name=whitburn/&gt; The Hot 100 continues to be published.

==Other terminology==
There are several commonly used terms when referring to a music/entertainment chart or the performance of a release thereon.

A ''new entry'' is a title which is making its début in that chart. This is applied to all charts, for instance a track which is outside the Top 40 but which later climbs into that level of the chart is considered to be a 'new entry' to the Top 40 that week. In most official charts, tracks have to have been on sale for a period of time in order to enter the charts; however, in some retailers' charts, new releases are included in charts as 'new entries' without a sales history in order to make them more visible to purchasers. A real ''new entry'' is a title that makes its chart début, no matter how many positions officially the chart actually is. In the UK the official published chart is a Top 100 although a new entry can take place between positions 101-200 (this is also true of the Billboard Hot 100, which has a "[[Bubbling Under Hot 100 Singles|bubbling under]]" addendum for new songs that have not yet made the Hot 100). The Top 40 is only used for radio to shorten the play-lists.

A ''re-entry'' is a track which has previously entered a chart falls out of that chart and then later re-appears in it. This may come about if a release is reissued or if there is a surge of interest in the track. Generally any repeat entry of a track into a chart is considered a re-entry, unless the later version of the track is a materially different recording or significantly repackaged (such as Michael Jackson's "Thriller 25"), where the release would normally be considered separate and thus a "new" entry.

A ''climber'' is a release which is going higher in the chart week-on-week. Because chart positions are generally relative to each other on a week-to-week basis, a release does not necessarily have to increase sales week-to-week to be a climber, as if releases ahead of it decline in sales sufficiently they may slip below it. By the same metric, not all week-to-week sales increases result in a climber, if other releases improve by a sufficient amount to keep it from climbing. The term ''highest climber'' is used to denote the release making the biggest leap upwards in the chart that week. There is generally not an equivalent phrase for tracks going down the chart; the term "faller" is occasionally used, but not as widely as 'climber'.

The ''top 10'', ''top 20'' and so forth are used to determine the relative success of a release. For instance, a track may be referred to as a 'top 10 hit' if it reaches a position between 1 and 10 on the singles chart, as a 'top 20 hit' if it reaches between positions 1 and 20, and so on. The most commonly known chart is the 'top 40' widely used by the media in various territories, though it is common for longer lists to be produced for or by the music industry. For example, in the UK, the [[Official Charts Company]] produces a top 200, although various media only publish shorter lists.

A ''[[one-hit wonder]]'' is an act that appears on the chart just once. The term ''true one-hit wonder'' was the term given by Guinness Book of British Hit Singles &amp; Albums (and also the Billboard book Top Pop Singles) is an act that has one number one hit and nothing else on the chart ever. If an act appears in some other form, (for example) a solo act that appears with a band or with other acts then these are taken separately.

== History ==
[[File:Tambo art in Yonezawa, Yamagata.jpg|thumb|Tambo art in Yonezawa, Yamagata]]
In 1993, the people of [[Inakadate, Aomori|Inakadate]], in [[Aomori Prefecture]], were looking for a way to revitalize their village. Archaeological exploration led to a realization that rice had been grown in the area for more than 2000 years.&lt;ref name="jtimes" /&gt; To honor this history, the villagers started a rice field behind the town hall. With the [[Paddy field|paddy]] as a canvas, the villagers cultivated and used four different types&lt;ref name="jtimes" /&gt; of heirloom and modern strains of rice to create a giant picture in the field. To allow viewing of the whole picture, a mock castle tower 22 meters high was erected at the village office.&lt;ref name="jtimes"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://search.japantimes.co.jp/cgi-bin/fl20070826x1.html|title=Homegrown art|last=Hani|first=Yoko|date=2007-08-26|publisher=The Japan Times|accessdate=2010-02-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2006, more than 200,000 people visited the village to see the art.&lt;ref name="jtimes" /&gt;

Another observation tower was built looking down the Tambo art location 2 at [[roadside station|Michi no eki]] Inakadate nicknamed “Yayoi no sato”&lt;ref name=inaka/&gt; or a village of prehistoric [[Yayoi period]]. Both places charge admission fees, while visitors are encouraged to take bus serving both location 1 and 2 to avoid traffic jam.&lt;ref name=inaka/&gt; In August 2015, a video camera was installed for both locations and started live stream the art,&lt;ref name=livecam&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.inakadate-tanboart.net/news/2015/08/post-1.html |title= Tambo Art has its website now|language=ja| publisher= Inakadate, Aomori|date= 2015-08-05|accessdate=2018-01-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; and they were registered on [[Google Street View]] the same year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.vill.inakadate.lg.jp/docs/2015090400027/|title=Tambo art is on Google Street View|publisher= Inakadate Village|language=ja|date= 2015-10-19 |accessdate=2018-01-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; A winter campaign since 2016 has been held on location 2 with instruction initially by snow artist Simon Beck.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.vill.inakadate.lg.jp/docs/2017113000016/|title= Winter tambo art 2018 will be held|date=2018-01-15|language=ja|publisher= Inakadate Village|accessdate=2018-01-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For the first nine years, the farmers created a simple picture of Mount Iwaki&lt;ref name="dailymail" /&gt;&lt;ref name="telegraph" /&gt; before going to more complex designs.

Following Inakadate's example, other villages such as [[Yonezawa, Yamagata|Yonezawa]] in Yamagata prefecture have started to create their own tambo art.&lt;ref name="telegraph" /&gt;

* 2017 - [[Yamata no Orochi]] against [[Susanoo-no-mikoto]], [[Momotarō]]&lt;ref name=inaka/&gt;

== Production ==
Every April, the villagers meet and decide what to plant for the year.&lt;ref name="jtimes" /&gt; Prior to planting, farmers sketch out the designs on computers to figure out where and how to plant the rice.&lt;ref name="telegraph"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/asia/japan/5965073/Farmers-create-coloured-rice-murals-in-Japan.html|title=Farmers create coloured rice 'murals' in Japan |date=08-03|publisher=Telegraph|accessdate=22 February 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2007, 700 people helped plant rice.&lt;ref name="jtimes" /&gt; In Inakadate, the fields used are approximately 15,000 square meters in area.&lt;ref name="dailymail"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/worldnews/article-1198381/Bizarre-spectacle-giant-crop-murals-covering-rice-fields-Japan.html|title=Bizarre spectacle of the giant crop murals covering rice fields in Japan|date=2009-07-09|publisher=Daily Mail|accessdate=22 February 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Agreements between landowners have allowed for larger pictures to be created.

== Advertising controversy ==
In 2008, it was planned to change the lower part of the field to include the logos of [[Japan Airlines]] and To-o Nippo, a local newspaper, for a reported 2 million yen to offset increased costs. The members of the local landowners' organization, along with the former mayor, protested, saying that the land would not be leased from the following year if the plan to display advertising logos was not abandoned. The village revitalization group voted by a narrow margin not to include the advertisements, and the seedlings that were planted were removed.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.asahi.com/national/update/0704/TKY200807040155.html 田んぼアート、広告いらない 地権者抗議で苗抜き取り] – Asahi Shimbun, 4 July 2008&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.toonippo.co.jp/news_too/nto2008/20080704072922.asp 田んぼアートの広告削除へ] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080707015517/http://www.toonippo.co.jp/news_too/nto2008/20080704072922.asp# |date=2008-07-07 }} – Too Nippo, 4 July 2008&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://mainichi.jp/select/wadai/horidashi/news/20080705mog00m040033000c.html 田んぼアート もったいない? 企業広告絵柄を抜き取り]{{dead link|date=April 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} – Mainichi Shimbun, 5 July 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

'''[[Somalia|Somali]] [[art]]''' is the artistic culture of the [[Somali people]], both historic and contemporary. These include artistic traditions in [[pottery]], [[music]], [[architecture]], [[woodcarving]] and other genres. Somali art is characterized by its [[aniconism]], partly as a result of the vestigial influence of the pre-Islamic [[Somali Mythology|mythology]] of the Somalis coupled with their ubiquitous [[Muslim]] beliefs. However, there have been cases in the past of artistic depictions representing living creatures such as the [[gold]]en [[bird]]s on the [[Mogadishu|Mogadishan]] [[Canopy (building)|canopies]], the ancient [[rock painting]]s in northern [[Somalia]], and the [[plant|plant decoration]]s on religious [[tomb]]s in southern Somalia, but these are considered rare. Instead, intricate patterns and geometric designs, bold colors and monumental architecture was the norm.

==History==
[[File:LaasGeel.jpg|thumb|140px|left|Ancient [[rock art]] depicting a [[camel]].]]
The oldest evidence of art in the [[Somali peninsula]] are [[pre-historic]] rock paintings. The rock art of [[Laas Geel]] are thought to be some of the best preserved in [[Africa]], representing cows in ceremonial robes accompanied by humans. The necks of the cows are embellished with a kind of ''[[plastron]]'', some of the cows are depicted as wearing decorative robes. The paintings not only show cows, but also a domesticated dogs, several paintings of [[canidae]] and a [[giraffe]].&lt;ref&gt;The Journal of African Archeology Volume 1.2 (2003) Chapter 3&lt;/ref&gt;

Aspects of ancient Somali styles of architecture and art can be seen in the various Somali civilizations that flourished under [[Islam]], particularly during the [[Mogadishu|Mogadishan]] [[Golden Age (metaphor)|Golden Age]] and the [[Ajuran Sultanate|Empire of Ajuran]] period (especially in the domain of architecture). In the early modern and contemporary era, [[poetry]] and [[theater|theatrical]] ventures shaped much of today's Somali artistic culture.

===Carving===
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Somali art.jpg|thumb|170px|right|Old carved window frame from medieval [[Mogadishu]] is a good example of Somali woodcarving.]] --&gt;
Carving, known in [[Somali language|Somali]] as ''qoris'', is a much respected profession in Somalia both in historic and modern times. Many wealthy urbanites in the medieval period regularly employed the finest wood and marble carvers in Somalia to work on their interiors and houses. The carvings on the [[mihrab]]s and [[Column|pillar]]s of ancient Somali [[mosque]]s are some of the oldest on the continent. Artistic carving was considered the province of men similar to how the Somali textile industry was mainly a women's business. Amongst the [[nomad]]s, carving, especially [[woodwork]], was widespread and could be found on the most basic objects such as [[spoon]]s, [[comb]]s and [[bowl (vessel)|bowls]], but it also included more complex structures such as the portable nomadic house, the ''aqal''. In the last several decades, traditional carving of windows, doors and furniture has taken a backseat to the introduction of workshops employing electrical [[machine]]ry which deliver the same results in a far shorter time period.&lt;ref&gt;Culture and customs of Somalia By Mohamed Diriye Abdullahi pg 97&lt;/ref&gt;

===Textile===
The textile culture of Somalia is an ancient one, and the Somali textile center in [[Mogadishu]] was, from at least the 13th century to the late 19th century, considered to be one of the main textile hubs in the [[Indian Ocean]]. It competed with those of the [[Demographics of India|Indian]]s and later the [[United States|American]]s in domestic and foreign markets such as [[Egypt]] and [[Syria]].&lt;ref&gt;Mohamed Diriye Abdullahi(2001) pg 100&lt;/ref&gt;

===Metalwork===
The [[goldsmith]]s and [[blacksmith]]s of the urban cities, though often shunned by the dominant [[nomad]]ic culture for their occupation, fashioned the city-dwellers' traditional display of wealth and power through ornaments such as [[jewelry]] in the case of women, or the intricately designed Somali [[dagger]] (''toraay'') in the case of men.

===Architecture===
{{main|Architecture of Somalia}}
[[File:Ancient-Almnara.jpg|thumb|200px|right| [[Almnara Tower]] in [[Mogadishu]], [[Somalia]].]]
[[Architecture of Somalia|Somali architecture]] is a rich and diverse tradition of [[engineering]] and [[designing]] multiple different [[construction]] types such as [[masonry|stone cities]], [[castles]], [[citadel]]s, [[fortresses]], [[mosques]], [[temples]], [[Aqueduct (watercourse)|aqueducts]], [[lighthouses]], towers and [[tombs]] during the ancient, [[medieval]] and [[early modern]] periods in Somalia, as well as the fusion of Somalo-Islamic architecture with Occidental designs in [[contemporary architecture|contemporary]] times.

In ancient Somalia, [[pyramid]]ical structures known in [[Somali language|Somali]] as ''taalo'' were a popular burial style, with hundreds of these [[drystone]] monuments scattered around the country today. Houses were built of [[Stonemasonry|dressed stone]] similar to the ones in [[Ancient Egypt]],&lt;ref&gt;Man, God and Civilization pg 216&lt;/ref&gt; and there are examples of [[courtyard]]s and large stone walls such as the [[Wargaade Wall]] enclosing settlements.

The adoption of Islam in the early medieval era of Somalia's history brought [[Islamic architecture|Islamic architectural influences]] from [[Arabia]] and [[Persia]], which stimulated a shift from [[drystone]] and other related materials in construction to [[Masonry|coral stone]], [[mud-brick|sundried bricks]], and the widespread use of [[limestone]] in Somali architecture. Many of the new architectural designs such as [[mosques]] were built on the ruins of older structures, a practice that would continue over and over again throughout the following centuries.&lt;ref&gt;Diriye, p.102&lt;/ref&gt;

Visual Art is not new to the Somali communities. Visual art namely paintings focus on rural landscapes, and colorful paintings of the cultural life. Some of the known visual artists display their skills through their presence on Somali web sites. Visual Art is emerging as a new chapter  in the history of Somali culture. When we talk about art, our attention is immediately drawn into performing art. Indeed, for some people, visual art is interpreted as anti religion, since it involves a corporal creation of a human being. There are very few Somali Visual Artists. They are under represented in the world of Modern African Art. Some of the known Somali Visual artists had created  their own web sites such as www.osmanart.net/ This webpage is run by a Somali Physician Artist and writer - Mohamed Buwe Osman. There are many Somali visual artists like the well known to most of the Somals Mr. Amin Amir and Abdul Arts. There are as well visual with college degree in Art like Mr. Ali Kulmiye Halane and Mr. Aziz.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="35784">{{Hypnosis|applications}}
'''Stage hypnosis''' is [[hypnosis]] performed in front of an audience for the purposes of entertainment, usually in a theatre or club. A modern stage hypnosis performance typically delivers a comedic show rather than simply a demonstration to impress an audience with powers of persuasion. Apparent effects of [[amnesia]], mood altering and [[hallucination]] may be demonstrated in a normal presentation. Stage hypnosis performances often encourage audience members to look further into the benefits of hypnotism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Lennis G. Echterling &amp; Jonathon Whalen |year=1995 |title=Stage hypnosis and public lecture effects on attitudes and beliefs regarding hypnosis |journal=[[American Journal of Clinical Hypnosis]] |volume=38 |issue=1 |pages=13–21 |doi=10.1080/00029157.1995.10403173}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The causes of behaviour exhibited by volunteers in stage hypnosis shows is an area of dispute. Some claim it illustrates altered states of consciousness (i.e., "hypnotic trance"). Others maintain that it can be explained by a combination of psychological factors observed in group settings such as disorientation, [[Compliance (psychology)|compliance]], [[peer pressure]], and ordinary [[suggestion]]. Others yet allege that deception plays a part.

==History==
Stage hypnosis evolved out of much older shows conducted by Mesmerists and other performers in the 18th and 19th centuries. Scottish surgeon [[James Braid (surgeon)|James Braid]] developed his technique of [[hypnosis]] after witnessing a stage performance by the travelling Swiss magnetic demonstrator [[Charles Lafontaine]] (1803–1892) in November 1841.&lt;ref&gt;"Magnetic demonstrator" – Gauld's term (Gauld, 1992, p. 204) – accurately describes Lafontaine; because whilst he was in the U.K., he only demonstrated "magnetic" phenomena; he never used it to treat anyone at any time (in public or private).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Braid always maintained that he had gone to Lafontaine's demonstration as an open-minded sceptic, eager to examine the evidence and, then, form a considered opinion of Lafontaine's work. He was neither a closed-minded cynic intent on destroying Lafontaine, nor a deluded and naïvely credulous believer seeking authorisation of his already formed belief (''Neurypnology'' (1843), p.2.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;For an extended account of the interactions between Braid and Lafontaine, see Yeates (2013), pp.103–308 passim.&lt;/ref&gt;

Braid was well aware of similar performances by "electro-biologists" in his day;&lt;ref&gt;"'''Electrobiology''': A mode of inducing hypnotism by having the subject look steadily at metallic disks. The process originated about the middle of the nineteenth century, and its fame was spread by numerous lecturers in England and the United States.", Melton, J.G. [2001] (ed), ''Encyclopedia of Occultism and Parapsychology (Fifth Edition), in Two Volumes, Volume 1 (A-L)'', Thomson Gale, (Farmington Hills), 2001, p.489.&lt;/ref&gt; e.g., Braid published the contents of an advertising hand-bill for an "electro-biology" performance by a visiting American, George W. Stone,&lt;ref&gt;Stone was the compiler and editor of [https://archive.org/details/philosophyelect00stongoog ''The Philosophy of Electro-Biology, or Electrical Psychology, in a Course of Nine Lectures, Delivered by J. B. Dods, before the United States Senate, at Washington, in 1850, etc'']. Stone was also involved, for a time, in the active promotion the medium, Maria Basheba Hayden (1826–1883), the wife of his close friend, William Richardson Hayden, M.D. (1820–1903), journalist, and editor of ''The Boston Atlas'', and a monthly newsletter called ''The Star Spangled Banner''. Maria Hayden, who graduated M.D. in 1865, also [[Augustus De Morgan#Spiritualism|assisted Augustus De Morgan in his paranormal investigations]].&lt;/ref&gt; on 12 March 1851, which, as well as clearly emphasising that Stone was claiming to use volunteers from the audience, rather than his own stooges/assistants, details some of the phenomena that Stone's audience might have expected to have displayed to them.

&lt;blockquote&gt;
Persons in a perfectly wakeful state, of well-known character and standing in society, who come forward voluntarily from among the audience, will be experimented upon. They will be deprived of the power of speech, hearing, sight. Their voluntary motions will be completely controlled, so that, they can neither rise up nor sit down, except at the will of the operator; their memory will be taken away, so that they will forget their own name and that of their most intimate friends; they will be made to stammer, and to feel pain in any part of their body at the option of the operator – a walking stick will be made to appear a snake, the taste of water will be changed to vinegar, honey, coffee, milk, brandy, wormwood, lemonade, etc., etc., etc. These extraordinary experiments are really and truly performed without the aid of trick, collusion, or deception, in the slightest possible degree.&lt;ref&gt;Braid's quote is at p.512 of [https://books.google.com/books?id=WjwCAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA511#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false Braid, J., "Electro-Biological Phenomena Physiologically and Psychologically Considered, by James Braid, M.R.C.S. Edinburgh, &amp;c. &amp;c. (Lecture delivered at the Royal Institution, Manchester, March 26, 1851)", ''The Monthly Journal of Medical Science'', Vol.12, (June 1851), pp.&amp;nbsp;511–530.]&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

These are identical to many of the demonstrations which became central to subsequent "stage hypnosis", in fact it seems that little changes except the name and the introduction of the hypnotic induction, etc. Likewise, the novelist [[Mark Twain]] similarly recounts a Mesmeric performance which clearly resembles 20th century stage hypnosis, in his autobiography.

The absence of any reference to "hypnotism" in these early performances, indeed before the term was coined, and the fact that they often lacked anything resembling a modern hypnotic induction is consistent with the skeptical view, that stage hypnosis is primarily the result of ordinary suggestion rather than hypnotic trance. Indeed, early performers often claimed that they were influencing their subjects by means of telepathy and other supernatural powers.

Others, however, were delivering performances that displayed the wide range of hypnotic manifestations to their audiences. In the United States, for example, in the 1890s, there was a small group of highly skilled stage hypnotists, all whom were managed by Thomas F. Adkin, who toured country-wide, playing to packed houses. Adkin's group included Sylvain A. Lee,&lt;ref&gt;Author of ''The Practice of Hypnotic Suggestion'' (1901). One of his specialties was hypnotising per medium of the telephone; poster at [http://lcweb2.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/h?pp/PPALL:@field(NUMBER+@band(var+0467))] [http://lcweb2.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/h?pp/PPALL:@field(NUMBER+@band(var+2023))]&lt;/ref&gt;
Mr. and Mrs. Herbert L. Flint,&lt;ref&gt;Herbert L. Flint was the author of ''Flint's lessons in hypnotism; a comprehensive work on scientific suggestion as applied in hypnotism, mesmerism, personal magnetism, magnetic healing, psycho-therapeutics, suggestive therapeutics and similar manefestations of mental development and control'' (1915); poster at [http://hdl.loc.gov/loc.pnp/var.1617]&lt;/ref&gt; and Professor Xenophon LaMotte Sage.&lt;ref&gt;Author of ''Hypnotism as It Is: a Book for Everybody'' (1897). Xenophon LaMotte Sage was the stage name of E. Virgil Neal; see Conroy, (2009), passim, especially pp.&amp;nbsp;27–40.&lt;/ref&gt;

===20th century===
Throughout the 20th century, despite adopting the term "hypnotism", stage hypnotists continued to explain their performances to audiences by reference to supernatural powers and [[animal magnetism]]. Ormond McGill, e.g., in his Encyclopedia of the subject wrote in 1996 that:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
Some have called this powerful transmission of thought from one person to another "thought projection". The mental energy used appears to be of two types: magnetic energy&amp;nbsp;... generated within the body and telepathic energy generated within the mind.&amp;nbsp;... The two work together as a unit in applying Power Hypnosis. The operation of the two energies in combination is what Mesmer referred to as "animal magnetism".&lt;ref&gt;Ormond McGill, The New Encyclopedia of Stage Hypnosis, 1996: 24&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

However, this is not what Braid meant by "hypnotism", a term coined in opposition to theories of Mesmerism, to stress the fact that the results were due to ordinary psychological and physiological processes, such as suggestion and focused attention, rather than telepathy or animal magnetism. Indeed, after meeting with Mr. Stone, experimenting with his own subjects, and presenting his findings on such performances to the [[Royal Institution]], Braid concludes,

&lt;blockquote&gt;
There is, therefore, both positive and negative proof in favour of my mental and suggestive theory, and in opposition to the magnetic, occult, or electric theories of the Mesmerists and electro-biologists. My theory, moreover, has this additional recommendation, that it is level to our comprehension, and adequate to account for all which is demonstrably true, without offering any violence to reason and common sense, or being at variance with generally admitted physiological and psychological principles.&lt;ref&gt;Braid, J. (1851). ''Electro-Biological Phenomena, etc.'', p.530.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

However, modern stage performers often continue to misuse the word "hypnosis" in describing their shows and encourage misconceptions about [[hypnotism]] by confusing it with [[Mesmerism]] for dramatic effect.{{Citation needed|reason=No evidence of current misconceptions|date=April 2013}}

==Skepticism==
[[File:Catalepsy example.png|thumb|right|[[Catalepsy]]: "the human bridge".]]
Mesmeric and other stage performances changed their names to "stage hypnotist" in the 19th century. They had originally claimed to produce the same effects by means of telepathy and animal magnetism, and only later began to explain their shows in terms of hypnotic trance and suggestion. Hence, many of the precursors of stage hypnosis did not employ hypnotic induction techniques. Moreover, several modern stage performers{{who|date=April 2013}} have themselves published criticisms which suggest that stage hypnosis is largely the result of sleight of hand, ordinary suggestion, and social compliance, etc., rather than hypnotic trance.{{Citation needed|reason=citation need for 'several' as well as 'modern'|date=April 2013}} Most notably, the well-known American magician and performer, [[Kreskin]], has frequently carried out typical stage hypnosis demonstrations without using any hypnotic induction. After working as a stage hypnotist and magician for nearly two decades, Kreskin became a skeptic and a whistleblower from within the stage hypnosis field.

&lt;blockquote&gt;
For nineteen years I had believed in&amp;nbsp;... the sleeplike "hypnotic trance," practicing it constantly. Though I had nagging doubts at times, I wanted to believe in it. There was an overpowering mystique about putting someone to sleep, something that set me and all other "hypnotists" apart. We were marvellous Svengalis or Dr. Mesmers, engaged in a supernatural practice of sorts. Then it all collapsed. For me anyway.&lt;ref&gt;Kreskin, The Amazing World of Kreskin, 1973: 143.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

After experimenting with his own subjects for several years until he was satisfied he could perform "stage hypnosis" without any hypnotic induction or trance, he concluded, "The battle of semantics may be waged for years, but I firmly believe that what is termed 'hypnosis' is, again, a completely normal, not abnormal, response to simple suggestion." An outspoken skeptic regarding stage hypnosis, Kreskin not only actively debunked stage hypnotists' claims, but went so far as to offer a substantial monetary reward, $25,000, to anyone who could prove the existence of hypnotic trance. The reward has been unsuccessfully challenged three times.&lt;ref&gt;Kreskin, The Amazing World of Kreskin, 1973: 152&lt;/ref&gt; While debunking the "sleep-trance" concept, Kreskin, like other skeptics adopting the nonstate position, was keen to emphasise that he felt the value of hypnotic suggestion had been frequently underestimated.

British stage hypnotist Alex Tsander has made a rejection of belief in a "state of hypnosis" a central feature of his career.&lt;ref&gt;Rider, D. 1995. "Playing Those Mind Games", Bath Chronicle, "Night Time" supplement, W/E March 8th&lt;/ref&gt; Tsander, who was among 39 parties consulted by the UK Home Office during their 1995-96 review of the regulation of performance,&lt;ref&gt;Dipple, D. 1996. UK Home Office circular No 39/1996 p. 2, para. 7&lt;/ref&gt; whilst continuing to perform, since 1993, also promoted a sceptical, social psychological view in a series of books. In "The Art and Secrets of Stage Hypnotism" &lt;ref name="Tsander, A 2006"&gt;Tsander, A. 2006, 2012. The Art and Secrets of Stage Hypnotism. Summitother. {{ISBN|0955073162}}&lt;/ref&gt; he stressed a terminological distinction between "hypnotism" and "hypnosis", stating that "hypnotism is the art of creating the illusion of hypnosis". Tsander calls his show "I Can't Believe It's NOT Hypnosis",&lt;ref&gt;Royle, J. 2005. Confessions of A Hypnotist: Everything You Ever Wanted to Know About Hypnosis But Were Afraid To Ask. Xlibris Corporation. P450.&lt;/ref&gt;{{Self-published inline|certain=yes|date=December 2017}} a title since adopted by others. Tsander boldly states in publicity that no participant is ever in a "state of hypnosis". He argues, in "Beyond Hypnosis",&lt;ref&gt;Tsander, A. 2005. Beyond Hypnosis: Hypnotism, Stage Hypnotism and The Myth of "Hypnosis", Summitother, {{ISBN|0955073189}}&lt;/ref&gt; that all activities that use hypnotic protocols, such as in hypnotherapy, are based in the cultural influence of roles and schemas of what it is to be hypnotised, ultimately created and sustained through the impressions made by stage hypnotists, manipulating social psychological factors. As an extreme illustration of this, Tsander has used the example of Milton Erickson. Whilst Erickson objected to stage hypnotism, Tsander argued, in "Beyond Erickson" &lt;ref&gt;Tsander, A. 2005. Beyond Erickson: A Fresh Look at "The Emperor of Hypnosis", Summitother. {{ISBN|0955073103}}&lt;/ref&gt; that the therapists reputation largely depended upon live demonstrations and that he was in effect a stage hypnotist. He takes Erickson's own accounts of his demonstrations and explains them in terms of normal, social psychological processes and interactions, requiring no special phenomenon or hypnosis to explain.

==Role of deception==

Due to stage hypnotists' showmanship, many people believe that hypnosis is a form of mind control. However, the effects of stage hypnosis are probably due to a combination of relatively ordinary social psychological factors such as peer pressure, social compliance, participant selection, ordinary suggestibility, and some amount of physical manipulation, stagecraft, and trickery.&lt;ref name="Yapko 1990 28"&gt;{{Cite book| last = Yapko | first = Michael |authorlink=Michael D. Yapko | title=Trancework: An introduction to the practice of Clinical Hypnosis | location=New York, New York | publisher=Brunner/Mazel | year=1990 | pages=28}}&lt;/ref&gt; The desire to be the centre of attention, having an excuse to violate their own inner fear suppressors and the pressure to please are thought to convince subjects to "play along".&lt;ref name="Wagstaff"&gt;Wagstaff, Graham F. (1981) ''Hypnosis, Compliance and Belief'', St. Martin's Press, New York. {{ISBN|0-312-40157-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Page needed|date=September 2010}} Books written by stage hypnotists sometimes explicitly describe the use of [[deception]] in their acts. For example, [[Ormond McGill|Ormond McGill's]] ''New Encyclopedia of Stage Hypnosis'' describes an entire "fake hypnosis" act which depends upon the use of private whispers throughout:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
[The hypnotist whispers off-microphone:] "We are going to have some good laughs on the audience and fool them&amp;nbsp;... so when I tell you to do some funny things, do exactly as I secretly tell you. Okay? Swell." (Then deliberately wink at the spectator in a friendly fashion.)&lt;ref&gt;McGill, Ormond. (1996) ''The New Encyclopedia of Stage Hypnosis'', p. 506.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

According to experts such as [[Theodore X. Barber]] and [[André Muller Weitzenhoffer]], stage hypnosis traditionally employs three fundamental strategies:
# '''Participant compliance'''. Participants on stage tend to be compliant because of the social pressure felt in the situation constructed on stage, before an expectant audience.
# '''Participant selection'''. Preliminary suggestion tests, such as asking the audience to clasp their hands and suggesting they cannot be separated, are usually used to select out the most suggestible and [[compliance (psychology)|socially compliant]] subjects from the audience. By asking for volunteers to mount the stage, the performer also tends to select the most [[extraverted]] members of the audience.
# '''Deception of the audience'''. Stage hypnotists are performers who traditionally, but not always, employ a variety of "sleight of hand" strategies to mislead their audience for dramatic effect.

The strategies of deception employed in traditional stage hypnosis can be categorised as follows:
# '''Off-microphone whispers'''. The hypnotist lowers his microphone and whispers secret instructions to the participant on stage, outside the audience's hearing. These may involve requests to "play along" or fake hypnotic responses.&lt;ref name=BSC&gt;Barber, Spanos &amp; Chaves. ''Hypnotism: Imagination &amp; Human Potentialities'' (1974), p. 105.&lt;/ref&gt;
# '''Failure to challenge'''. The stage hypnotist pretends to challenge subjects to defy a suggestion, for example, "You cannot stand up out of your chair because your backside is stuck down with glue." However, no specific cue is given to the participants to begin their effort ("Start trying now!"). This creates the illusion that a specific challenge has been issued and effort made to defy it.&lt;ref name=BSC /&gt;
# '''Fake hypnosis tricks'''. Stage hypnosis literature contains a large repertoire of sleight of hand tricks, of the kind used by professional illusionists. None of these tricks require any hypnosis or suggestion, but depend purely on physical manipulation and audience deception. The most famous example of this type is the "human plank" trick, which involves making a subject's body become rigid (cataleptic) and suspending them horizontally between two chairs, at which point the hypnotist will often stand upon their chest for dramatic effect. This has nothing to do with hypnosis, but simply depends on the fact that when subjects are positioned in the correct way they can support more weight than the audience tends to assume.&lt;ref name=BSC /&gt;
# '''Stooges'''. Several experts, including Kreskin, have stated that stage hypnotists have been known to make use of stooges (also called ''horses'') who travel from show to show. A stage hypnotist may only require a single stooge because by using him first for each demonstration real subjects from the audience will tend to follow his lead and imitate his responses. Moreover, for the climax of the show, the hypnotist will often focus on one or two subjects to demonstrate more difficult and dramatic responses involving apparent hallucinatory experiences. A single stooge can be used for this purpose.&lt;ref&gt;Kreskin. ''The Amazing World of Kreskin'' (1973), p. 149.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Weitzenhoffer400&gt;[[André Muller Weitzenhoffer|Weitznehoffer, Andre]]. ''The Practice of Hypnotism'' (2000), p. 400.&lt;/ref&gt;

Weitzenhoffer writes:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Having not only had a chance to watch famous stage hypnotists of the 1940s and 50s such as [Ralph] Slater&lt;ref&gt;Real name Joseph Bolsky (see [https://www.facebook.com/media/set/?set=a.198933960176777.46878.184120231658150&amp;type=3] ("Dr. Wilbur" is [[Cornelia B. Wilbur]]), and [http://law.justia.com/cases/federal/appellate-courts/F2/192/308/210802]).&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Franz Polgar|Polgar]] at work but having also had a chance to have fairly extensive personal contact with other stage hypnotists, I believe I can throw some light upon the situation. To begin with, one should be aware that many stage hypnotists use stooges or plants.&lt;ref name=Weitzenhoffer400 /&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

However, Alex Tsander argues&lt;ref&gt;Tsander, A. 2006,2012. The Art and Secrets of Stage Hypnotism, Summitother. {{ISBN|0955073162}}&lt;/ref&gt; that use of a stooge has in modern times been for all practical purposes inconceivable because of the frequency of their reappearance in different performances (sometimes repeatedly at the same venue) and the dire consequences of being discovered. A likelihood increased by the Internet, social media and camera-phones in the audience.

Whilst denying the existence of a "state of hypnosis", Tsander has since the early 1990s presented "close up" sessions in which volunteers sit with him at a table whilst the audience sit or stand adjacent. An audience in close proximity makes the kind of subterfuge mentioned above, such as stage whispers, impossible. For Tsander, coupled with his denying a state of hypnosis, this demonstrates that social psychology and suggestion offer sufficient explanation for all hypnotic effects. Under favourable circumstances neither "hypnosis" nor deception is necessary to obtain even the most theatrical behaviour from suitable volunteers.&lt;ref&gt;Tsander, A. Visual Reference, 1.Accessed online at: https://www.flickr.com/photos/16196214@N07/1753544748/in/album-721576027209907589/&lt;/ref&gt;

On the other hand, those who argue for a substantial "state" of hypnosis cite clinical claims (not actually evidenced in any case of stage performance, one hopes) such as the following:

"...editorial implying most subjects have no will or interest in not following the suggestion of the hypnotist, conveniently omit the primary interest in hypnotism came in the early 1800's before ether and morphine were widely available. Thousands of extremely painful operations were performed through the use of hypnosis. Patients awoke without memory of the surgery and even healed much faster than those who endured the extreme pain without hypnosis. Sigmund Freud was directly responsible for removing hypnosis from psychotherapy because of so many reports that patients also had intuitions about conditions of patients they had never met while in the trance state."&lt;ref&gt;Anon. 2016. Edit to this Wiki as quoted.{{reliable source|date=March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Such arguments originate in the work of James Esdaile at a medical mission in India, recounted in his book of 1847. This was before the concept of "hypnotism" (only recently promoted by Braidin 1843) had spread and Esdailes work was still referred to as "Mesmerism". Whilst Esdaile claimed his patients felt no pain observers on behalf of an independent commission of enquiry for the Bengal government reported scenes of those undergoing such operations writhing in agony. Regarding more recent claims of painless surgery, Barber, among others, has pointed out that detail in accounts of such surgery admit that patients are, even though not unconscious, rendered stuporous by cocktails of anxiolytics. Moreover, the proportion of patients capable of undergoing such procedures (attaining sufficiently "deep" "hypnosis") is as small as the percentage of the population who are capable of undergoing surgery with neither chemical nor hypnotic assistance, inviting the suspicion that these groups of "special" patients overlap. Moreover, Barber also points out that invariably, cases of hypnotic surgery do use local anaesthetic at the area of incision, whilst internal organs are not capable of registering pain in response to a skilled cut rendering many such operations feasible without general anaesthetic, the role of hypnotic influence being essentially at an emotional or anxiolytic level. Furthermore, far from there being "thousands" of such cases of hypno-anaesthesia in surgery it remains sufficiently rare as to warrant the attention of news reports when it occurs. As rare, indeed, as the exceptional individuals able to undergo such surgery.

However, none of the foregoing debate about hypnotic procedures in a clinical setting has any bearing upon stage hypnosis.

==Role of hypnotist and subject==

=== Hypnotist ===
[[File:Nazareth College Hypnotist.jpg|thumb|right|A stage hypnotist and his subjects]]

Due to stage hypnotists' showmanship and their perpetuating the [[illusion]] of possessing mysterious abilities, the appearance of a trance state is often interpreted as an "effect" of the hypnotist's "power". The real power of stage hypnosis comes from the trust the "hypnotist" can instill in their subjects. Subjects have to cooperate and be willing to follow instructions and the hypnotist will employ several tests to choose the best subjects. Some people are very trusting, or even looking for an excuse to abdicate their responsibilities and are apparently able to be "hypnotised" within seconds, while others take more time to counter their fears.

Suggestion is very powerful and a good hypnotist will know how to deliver suggestions that can create better entertainment for the audience. In his book ''Deeper and Deeper'' by Jonathan Chase,&lt;ref&gt;Chase, Jonathan (2005) ''Deeper and Deeper'' the secrets of stage hypnosis - p. 101&lt;/ref&gt; he talks about delivering suggestion, more importantly, The Super Suggestion a phrase he coined in his first published book in 1999:

&lt;blockquote&gt;"From this moment everything I say to you. Every single thing I say, no matter how silly or stupid it seems will instantly become your reality. Everything I say will instantly become your reality."&lt;/blockquote&gt;

He emphasises the use of repetition but warns that when they have accepted the suggestion then everything that the hypnotist says to them after this point will become an irresistible suggestion.

Historically, stage hypnotists often made claims for hypnotically induced enhancements to volunteer abilities beyond normal limits. One such routine that persists is that of "The Human Bridge". The English hypnotist Alex Tsander has made a particular theme of taking this cliché routine, which is still touted by many hypnotists as a uniquely hypnotic "feat", and de-bunking it by demonstrating that no hypnosis is required. He does this in studio videos with non-hypnotised volunteers, both models and himself, talking to camera. Whilst emphasising that no weight should ever be placed on a person in that situation (which is specifically forbidden in public UK performances under the Model Conditions) he explains in "The Art and Secrets of Stage Hypnotism" &lt;ref&gt;Tsander, A. 2005, 2012. The Art and Secrets of Stage Hypnotism. Summitother. {{ISBN|0955073162}}&lt;/ref&gt; how performers elsewhere deceive audiences when doing so. At the Kit Kat club, Berlin, in 2012, whilst appearing as himself, Tsander also performed as "Erektor The Bridgebuilder" presenting "Bridgeward Bound",&lt;ref&gt;Residentadvisor. 2012. Wasteland Berlin. Accessed online at: https://www.residentadvisor.net/event.aspx?395975&lt;/ref&gt; an erotic bondage version of the Human Bridge with a female co-performer, that dramatically fore-grounded the fact that the "feat" requires no hypnosis, which was neither induced nor pretended.

===Subjects===
In a stage hypnosis situation the "hypnotist" chooses their participants carefully. First they give the entire audience a few exercises to perform and plant ideas in their minds, such as:
*only intelligent people can be hypnotised
*only those who are open-minded to being hypnotised and willing to participate.

It has been alleged that these suggestions are designed to overcome the natural fear of trusting a stranger with the greater fear of becoming an object of ridicule as one who is unintelligent, unsociable, and joyless. However, whilst a self-proclaimed "sceptic", British stage hypnotist Alex Tsander argues that a more important reason for such admonitions is to filter out "pseudo-volunteers": those who only offer to participate in order to prove that they are as they see it "too intelligent" to respond, or who want to show that they can resist becoming hypnotised, with no intention to genuinely cooperate in achieving a positive result. Tsander advises that a hypnotist should state clearly at the outset that "anyone can resist being hypnotised, so to do so will prove nothing."&lt;ref name="Tsander, A 2006"/&gt;

Out of the crowd the hypnotist will spot people who appear trusting, extroverted and willing to put on a show. The hypnotist starts them off by having them imagine ordinary situations that they have likely encountered, like being cold or hot, hungry or thirsty then gradually builds to giving them a suggestion to do something that is totally out of character, such as tap dancing, singing like [[Elvis]] or clucking like a [[chicken]].

The desire to be the centre of attention, having an excuse to violate their own inner fear suppressors and the pressure to please, plus the expectation of the audience wanting them to provide some entertainment is usually enough to persuade an extrovert to do almost anything. In other words, the participants are persuaded to 'play along'. Yet, whilst this accounts for some situations, it does not accord with those where hecklers, uncooperative audiences and those who wish to "disprove" the hypnotist create a set of negative expectations, uncooperative atmosphere and opposition which the performer must use skill to overcome.

== Law ==
In some countries, there are laws and guidelines regarding stage hypnosis.

In the UK, the Hypnotism Act 1952 governs the use of hypnosis in public. The original Act was amended in 1976 and again in 2003.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.legislation.gov.uk/changes/affected/ukpga/1952/46&lt;/ref&gt; In 1996 the government released "model conditions" which were refined and revised after consultation with FESH and with medical and academic psychologists. Note that these have no legal force: they are suggested conditions which local authorities may or may not feel appropriate to impose or modify when regulating hypnosis.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.fesh.co.uk/Law.htm&lt;/ref&gt; If stage hypnosis is performed at a public venue a permit (permission) must be acquired from the local authority and the local authority is advised to monitor the performance to ensure that all guidelines are followed. It is illegal to hold any form of stage hypnosis in a public venue (amongst other venues) unless the local authority has issued their consent for this.

In the accompanying circular announcing the revised model conditions in 1996&lt;ref&gt;Dipple, D. 1996. UK Home Office circular No39/1996&lt;/ref&gt; it was conceded that, as asserted by skeptical stage hypnotist Alex Tsander during the consultation process:

''"In practice volunteers do not react as if they truly believe that there is, for example, a giant spider behind them or a bomb under their chair."''&lt;ref&gt;Dipple, 1996, p6, sub-section "Previous Section 3(I)(Vi).&lt;/ref&gt;

This was a critical point of distinction and represents a formal recognition of the "as if" nature of behaviour in stage hypnotism in contradistinction to claims for its supposed subjective reality.

In the past, stage hypnosis has been banned in several countries in the world including Denmark and some states in the USA. Most of these countries have revoked these laws or don't enforce them.{{cn|date=June 2018}} In Israel, it remains illegal to perform any kind of hypnosis without a license given to doctors, dentists and psychologists.{{Citation needed|date=November 2011}}
In [[Belgium]], stage hypnosis has been forbidden since 1892;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ejustice.just.fgov.be/eli/loi/1892/05/30/1892053051/justel Loi sur l'hypnotisme, 30 mai 1892, article 1].&lt;/ref&gt; the law was mentioned in 2017 to force the cancellation of a spectacle by Messmer.&lt;ref&gt;Agence Belga, [http://www.lalibre.be/regions/hainaut/le-spectacle-de-messmer-annule-a-colfontaine-car-l-hypnose-en-spectacle-est-illegal-selon-la-loi-5a0b4a28cd70fa5a063cb55b Le spectacle de Messmer annulé à Colfontaine car l’hypnose en spectacle est illégal selon la loi], ''La Libre Belgique'' (14 novembre 2017)&lt;/ref&gt;

The founding members are Terry Kinney, Jeff Perry, and Gary Sinise. The founders recruited six additional members:  H.E. Baccus,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.abouttheartists.com/artists/323827-h-e-baccus|title=H.E.

In 1975, Steppenwolf incorporated as a [[nonprofit organization]], saving money by taking the name of a failed theater company that had already incorporated.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.nytimes.com/2018/02/21/magazine/laurie-metcalf-lady-bird-roseanne.html&lt;/ref&gt; In the summer of 1976, Steppenwolf took up residence in a vacant basement space of the Immaculate Conception Catholic Church&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.icparish.org/contact|title=Contact Us |publisher=Immaculate Conception Catholic Church}}&lt;/ref&gt; in [[Highland Park, Illinois]] and produced its first full season of plays.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.vanityfair.com/culture/2016/08/steppenwolf-theatre-40-years|title=How Chicago’s Famed Steppenwolf Became the Apple of Theater|first=Donald|last=Liebenson|work=[[Vanity Fair (magazine)|Vanity Fair]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="steppenwolf.org"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=PXmcDAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA19&amp;lpg=PA19&amp;dq=basement|title=Steppenwolf Theatre Company of Chicago: In Their Own Words|first=John|last=Mayer|date=August 11, 2016|publisher=Bloomsbury Publishing|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1980, the theater company moved into a 134-seat theater at the [[Hull House#Theater|Jane Addams Hull House Center]] on Broadway Avenue in Chicago.  Two years later, the company moved to a 211-seat facility at 2851 N. Halsted Street, which was their home until 1991, when construction was completed on the current theater complex at 1650 N. Halsted Street (with administrative offices at 1700 N. Halsted Street.)

In 1982, [[Sam Shepard]]'s ''[[True West (play)|True West]]'', starring Sinise and [[John Malkovich]], was the first of many Steppenwolf productions to travel to New York City. 

In 1994, the company made its Los Angeles debut with [[Steve Martin]]'s first play, ''[[Picasso at the Lapin Agile]]''.

In 1996, after successful runs in Chicago and New York, Lyle Kessler's [[Orphans (Lyle Kessler play)|Orphans]], directed by Gary Sinise, was the first Steppenwolf production to go international, debuting in London.

The [[MacArthur Foundation]] awarded Steppenwolf Theatre Company $2,260,000 between 1978 and 2017, in support of general operations, and growth of artistic and educational programs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.macfound.org/grantees/1408/|title=Steppenwolf Theatre Company — MacArthur Foundation|publisher=[[MacArthur Foundation]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1988, Steppenwolf presented the world premiere of Frank Galati's adaption of ''[[The Grapes of Wrath (play)|The Grapes of Wrath]]'', based on the [[John Steinbeck]] novel, which eventually went on to win the [[Tony Award]] for Best Play. In 2000 Steppenwolf presented the world premiere of [[Austin Pendleton]]'s ''[[Orson's Shadow]]'', which subsequently was staged [[off-Broadway]] and by [[Regional theater in the United States|regional theatre]]s throughout the country.

Tracy Letts' Broadway drama ''[[August: Osage County]]'' (2007) was ranked number one in ''[[Time (magazine)|Time's]]'' Top Ten Theatre Performances of 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| author=[[Richard Zoglin]] |author2=Tracy Letts | title=Top 10 Theater Productions | work=[[Time (magazine)|Time]] |url= http://www.time.com/time/specials/2007/top10/article/0,30583,1686204_1686244_1692116,00.html | accessdate=2008-05-30 | date=December 9, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; After moving from the Imperial Theatre next door to The Music Box Theatre for an open-ended run, ''August: Osage County'' won five [[Tony Awards]] including Best Play of 2007, Best Director (Anna D. Shapiro), Best Leading Actress (Deanna Dunagan), Best Featured Actress (Rondi Reed), and Best Scenic Design ([[Todd Rosenthal]]).

'''TG4''' ({{lang-ga|TG Ceathair}}; {{IPA-ga|tʲeː ɟeː ˈcahəɾʲ|pron}} or {{IPA-ga|tiː d͡ʒiː ˈcahəɾʲ|}}) is an Irish [[public service broadcaster]] for [[Irish language|Irish-language]] speakers. The channel launched on 31 October 1996. It is available to 98% of homes in Ireland through [[digital terrestrial television]] [[Saorview]] and is available on [[Virgin Media Ireland]], [[Eircom|eVision]], [[Magnet Networks]] and [[Sky Ireland]]. TG4 is also available to watch online live and to view previously broadcast programmes from around the world through the [[TG4 Player]].

TG4 was formerly known as '''{{lang|ga|Teilifís na Gaeilge}}''' or '''TnaG''', before a rebranding campaign in 1999. TG4 was the third national station to be launched in Ireland; after [[RTÉ One]] in 1961 (as {{lang|ga|Teilifís Éireann}}) and [[RTÉ Two]] in 1978; and was followed by [[TV3 (Ireland)|TV3]] in 1998. The channel has 650,000 viewers who tune into the channel each day to view a broad programming policy. It has been reported to have a share of 2% of the national television market in the Republic of Ireland and 3% of the national television market in Northern Ireland. The daily Irish-language programme schedule is its core service: seven hours of programming in Irish supported by a wide range of material in other languages, mostly English.

TG4 launched its high-definition channel ('''TG4 HD''') in 2012 on [[Virgin Media Ireland]].&lt;ref&gt;"TG4 HD to Launch in 1 October" &lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"TG4 HD to Launch in 30 September"&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
In 1969, [[Lelia Doolan]], Jack Dowling and [[Bob Quinn (Irish filmmaker)|Bob Quinn]] published ''Sit down and Be Counted'', a book describing their campaign for a separate Irish-language television service. Bob Quinn is a maverick film director who produced many documentaries and fiction films through the Irish language on limited budgets, including the first Irish-language feature film ''[[Poitín (film)|Poitín]]'' starring [[Niall Tóibín]], [[Cyril Cusack]] and [[Donal McCann]].&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;A Separate Irish language Television Channel? by Margaret O'Connor, Dublin City University&lt;/ref&gt;

The three writers proposed small temporary buildings for [[Gaeltacht]] regional television services broadcasting a limited number of hours each night with programming coming from each of the Gaeltacht regions around the country.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

[[Raidió Teilifís Éireann|RTÉ]] and the Irish government had sought to improve the availability of Irish-language programming on RTÉ services. In 1972, [[RTÉ Raidió na Gaeltachta]] (RnaG) was set up to provide Irish-language radio services across the country. All radio and television services provided by RTÉ provided some Irish-language programming.

In 1980, a new group called ''Coiste ar son Teilifís Gaeltachta'' (The Committee for Irish-Language Television) was set up. In 1987 they set up the pirate television station Telefís na Gaeltachta, after years of delays, including the sudden death of their technician who was to build the transmitter. Eighteen hours of live and pre-recorded programming was broadcast between 2 and 5 November 1987. The transmitter was built at a cost of [[Irish pounds|IR£4,000]] through donations from local [[Gaeltacht]] communities. In December 1988, further broadcasts were transmitted from three different sites, broadcasting pre-recorded programming.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

The movement for a national Irish-language television service continued to gain momentum afterwards. In 1989, Ciarán Ó Feinneadha, one of the members of ''Coiste ar son Teilifís Gaeltachta'', moved to [[Dublin]] and set up a similar organisation in the capital called ''Feachtas Náisiúnta Teilifíse'' (FTN). FTN outlined their demands:

* A television station to be set up in the [[Gaeltacht]] regions serving the [[Gaeltacht]] and Irish speakers across the country.
* It should be linked to RTÉ, but independent from both editorial and organisational points of view.
* A special authority set up to run it with representatives from RTÉ, the Department of Communications, and [[Údarás na Gaeltachta]].&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

It was also suggested that the cap on advertising on RTÉ be removed and the additional funds be designated for the new services. [[Ray Burke (Irish politician)|Ray Burke]] had limited the advertising minutes on RTÉ a few years previously. Hence, there would be no cost to the Exchequer, and funding would also come from the National Lottery and the television Licence.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

FTN suggested two hours of programming each day, with the rest of the broadcast hours used for [[Open University]] type programming.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

In the early 1990s, Irish language programmes amounted to only 5% of total programming broadcast by RTÉ, and was reduced significantly during the summer months.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; Programmes included ''[[Echo Island]]'' for children, and current affairs programme ''Cúrsaí''. Before the birth of TG4, RTÉ had suggested the use of RTÉ Two's prime-time schedule for Irish-language programming.

The outgoing coalition parties of [[Fianna Fáil]] and the [[Progressive Democrats]] called for the establishment of an Irish language television station in their 1989 [[manifestos]]. Fianna Fáil stated that they would set up an Irish language television service in the Galway Gaeltacht that would service the whole country. The PDs also looked for the setting up of what they called "Teilifís na Gaeltachta". The Green Party's manifesto from 1987 also called for the establishment of such a channel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://michaelpidgeon.com/manifestos/byelection.htm|title=: :Irish Manifestos : :|work=michaelpidgeon.com|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20140208202243/http://michaelpidgeon.com/manifestos/byelection.htm|archivedate=8 February 2014|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Fianna Fáil]] entered into coalition with [[Labour Party (Ireland)|The Labour Party]] in 1993 and as part of their programme for government they included the setting up of TnaG. Taoiseach [[Albert Reynolds]] appointed [[Michael D. Higgins]] as Minister for Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht and the responsibility for broadcasting moved to his department. This government left office in 1994 and was replaced by the [[24th Government of Ireland|Rainbow Coalition]]. The new programme for government also sought to launch TnaG as the 3rd channel. Michael D. Higgins remained as Minister for Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht under Taoiseach [[John Bruton]]. TnaG launched in 1996.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://michaelpidgeon.com/manifestos/pfgs.htm|title=: :Irish Manifestos : :|work=michaelpidgeon.com}}{{dead link|date=September 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===On the air===
The total cost in establishing the transmission and links networks, and the construction of the station's headquarters in the [[Connemara]] [[Gaeltacht]], was IR£16.1 million. Annual running costs increased from IR£10.2 million in 1996 to IR£16 million in 2001, and €30 million in 2006.

[[File:Tnag425x250.jpg|thumb|left|TnaG Logo 1996 to 1999 at launch]]

In fewer than six months from the launch of Teilifís na Gaeilge, almost 65% of Ireland's television sets were able to receive the channel and the nightly audience had risen to 250,000 viewers. Three months later, in May 1997, independent research revealed that the station was able to attract audiences of 500,000, or 68% of television sets in Ireland, for at least one hour's viewing per week.

Very significant assistance in non-monetary terms comes from RTÉ which is required to provide over 360 hours of programming annually at no cost to TG4. It was not until 1996 that TnaG came on air. Their aim, initially, was to show one hour of Irish-language programming each night, increasing to two hours by 1999.

Initial criticisms of the planned station came from journalist [[Kevin Myers]] who derided TnaG as a [[white elephant]], calling it 'Telefís De Lorean', in a reference to the ill-fated [[DeLorean Motor Company]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.herald.ie/entertainment/tv-radio/the-cheers-27889128.html The cheers], ''[[Evening Herald]]'' 17 October 2008&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.irishtimes.com/opinion/letters/trinity-of-errors-1.64888 TRINITY OF ERRORS?], ''[[Irish Times]]'', July 6, 1996&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2006 the Irish postal service, [[An Post]], celebrated ten years of the Irish-language station with a commemorative stamp. The station also launched a book entitled ''TG4@10: Deich mBliana de TG4'' (Ten Years of TG4).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.galwayindependent.com/local-news/local-news/tg4-book-celebrates-milestone/ |archive-url=https://archive.is/20130123225915/http://www.galwayindependent.com/local-news/local-news/tg4-book-celebrates-milestone/ |dead-url=yes |archive-date=23 January 2013 |title=TG4 book celebrates milestone |date=22 October 2008 |publisher=Galway Independent |accessdate=7 June 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 1 April 2007, Teilifís na Gaeilge became an independent [[state-sponsored bodies of the Republic of Ireland|statutory corporation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/2001/en/act/pub/0004/sec0044.html#partvi-sec44|title=Broadcasting Act, 2001|work=irishstatutebook.ie}}&lt;/ref&gt; Former [[Gaelic Athletic Association]] president Peter Quinn became first chairman of the corporation. The other members appointed to the authority were Joe Connolly, Pádraig MacDonnacha, Eilís Ní Chonghaile, Méabh Mhic Ghairbheith, Méadhbh Nic an Airchinnigh, Bríd Ní Neachtáin, Feargal Ó Sé, and Regina Culliton.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dcmnr.gov.ie/Press+Releases/Minister+for+Communications+Marine+and+Natural+Resources+Noel+Dempsey+T.D.+Announces+Members+of+Teil.htm Minister for Communications Marine and Natural Resources Noel Dempsey T.D.

RTÉ holds a share in [[Euronews]], meaning TG4 could no longer broadcast the service.

On 1 July 2007, TG4 was accepted as a new member of the [[European Broadcasting Union]].

In 2008, TG4 became a founding member of [[World Indigenous Television Broadcasters Network]] (WITBN).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.witbn.org/?page_id=129#linkmaoritv |title=WITBN |publisher=WITBN |date= |accessdate=9 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 12 July 2009, the [[Broadcasting Act 2009]] was signed into law. Many of the provisions of the Act relating to RTÉ also apply to TG4, with the station being subject to regulation from the new Broadcasting Authority of Ireland once the relevant provisions are commenced. The Act also changed the English-language title of the Chief Executive of TG4 to "Director-General" in line with RTÉ, and in the Irish language from "Ceannasaí" to "Ardstiúrthóir".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tg4.ie/corp/foir/foir.asp |title=AISEOLAS |publisher=TG4 |language=Irish |accessdate=1 July 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100611234139/http://www.tg4.ie/corp/foir/foir.asp |archivedate=11 June 2010 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; There have been three Chief Executives of TG4, [[Cathal Goan]] (former [[Director-General of RTÉ]] from 1996 to 2000)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.rte.ie/about/goanc.html |title=Director-General – Cathal Goan |publisher=RTÉ Press Office |accessdate=1 July 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100814005521/http://www.rte.ie/about/goanc.html |archivedate=14 August 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and his successor Director General, [[Pól Ó Gallchóir]] (2000 - 2016).

==Operation==
{{Main article|Teilifís na Gaeilge (corporation)}}

The daily Irish-language programme schedule is its central service, broadcasting approximately 2.5 hours a day of new Irish-language programming, with an estimated 2.5 hours a day of repeated Irish-language programmes. Currently, RTÉ supplies TG4 with one hour a day of Irish-language programming. The remainder of the TG4 schedule is made up of acquisitions from other broadcasters particularly from US broadcasters.

Operating as a publisher and broadcaster, TG4 invests up to €20m annually in original indigenous programming from the independent production sector in Ireland. The Irish-language soap opera ''[[Ros na Rún]]'' is one of its most popular programmes, and it also commissions a relatively large number of documentaries.

===Scheduling===
During the first two years of TnaG, the service provided a "blocked" schedule. A distinct language schedule was created in line with their commitment to provide two hours of Irish-language television each day. Children's television ran from 17:00 to 18:00, while the prime time Irish-language block began at 20:00 and ended at 22:30 each night. In 1998, the channel began experimenting with their prime time schedule (due to low audience figures and pressure from independent producers). The prime time block was reduced by 30 minutes, ending at 22:00, while they tested Irish-language programming in late night slots after English-language programming, this schedule increased the audience for Irish programmes that followed English programmes. A new "hammocking" schedule was introduced. "Hammocking" is a term used in public service broadcasting meaning that shows with low audience appeal are placed between programmes with high appeal, thus increasing audience share for weaker programming. In 1999, the channel was renamed as TG4. The main aim of its new schedules was to provide "national resonance"{{clarify|post-text=Please explain this term|date=November 2011}} and to compete with [[BBC Two]] and [[Channel 4]] for Irish audiences.&lt;ref name="MacDubhghaill"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aber.ac.uk/mercator/images/UinsionnMacDubhghaill.pdf |title=Harry Potter and the Wizards of Baile na hAbhann: Translation, subtitling and dubbing policies in Ireland's TG4, from the start of broadcasting in 1996 to the present day |last=MacDubhghaill |first=Uinsionn |publisher=ABER.ac.uk |accessdate=11 July 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101129192352/http://www.aber.ac.uk/mercator/images/UinsionnMacDubhghaill.pdf |archivedate=29 November 2010 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

TG4 lost its language-driven schedule and replaced it with a stronger audience-driven schedule, with key audiences delivered at key times. TG4 aims to be a mainstream channel for a niche audience. This new scheduling provided TG4 with a strong increase in audience share during the first six months of the newly re-branded channel, rising from 1% to 2% and, by 2005, TG4 had become the eighth most watched television channel with 2.4% audience share, just below BBC Two and Channel 4, and well ahead of [[Sky One]].&lt;ref name="MacDubhghaill" /&gt;

===Budget===
The [[Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources]] reduced TG4's grant-in-aid from the exchequer to €32.25m for 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tg4.ie/assets/files/TB2010-B.pdf |title=TG4 Annual Report |publisher=TG4 |accessdate=5 August 2011 }}{{dead link|date=June 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

in 2008 the Teilifís na Gaeilge authority received a budget of €38m for and co-funded productions with the [[Broadcasting Authority of Ireland|BAI]]'s sound and vision fund received €4.6m. The Department of Communications, Marine and Natural Resources reduced their budget from the exchequer to €35m for 2009.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tg4.ie/bearla/corp/pr/2009/0421-1.asp TG4 BOARD APPROVES REDUCED BUDGET FOR 2009] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090817091559/http://www.tg4.ie/Bearla/corp/pr/2009/0421-1.asp |date=17 August 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2007, TG4 earned €3,596,000 in advertising revenue and had state funding of €24,914,000. The station spent €17,716,000 on programming.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tg4.ie/bearla/corp/docs/TB2007-B.pdf TG4 Annual Report 2007] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110304065332/http://www.tg4.ie/bearla/corp/docs/TB2007-B.pdf |date=4 March 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2006, TG4 spent €15,469,000 on commissioned programming and €7.5 million on acquired shows. The latter consisted mainly of children's programmes which are dubbed into Irish.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tg4.ie/bearla/corp/docs/TB2006-B.pdf TG4 Annual Report 2006]{{dead link|date=June 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

TG4 has had a share of the Irish television market of some 3%,&lt;ref&gt;Kenny, Colum. [http://www.independent.ie/opinion/editorial/time-to-call-a-halt-to-the-lip-service-behind-tg4-success-26415784.html "Time to call a halt to the lip service behind TG4 'success'"], ''The Independent (Ireland)'', 27 August 2006. Accessed 10 February 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; with an average daily viewership of 730,000. TG4 provide their viewing figures each week on their website. Currently TG4's top ten programmes have ranged from 10,000 to 100,000 viewers, but their top shows have reached as high as 250,000. Like other television services TG4 achieves their highest viewing figures with sporting events.&lt;ref name="tg4.ie"&gt;[http://www.tg4.ie/leir/luch.asp] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090626124520/http://www.tg4.ie/leir/luch.asp |date=26 June 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On Saint Patrick's Day 2009, live coverage of the All-Ireland Finals in the AIB Club Championships on TG4 achieved very high audience ratings for the channel. Twenty five percent of afternoon television viewers on St. Patrick's Day were tuned into TG4. Over 1.1m viewers tuned on TG4 during the day, giving it an overall 8.2% national daily share and placing it in third place in the national daily viewing table for the first time ever.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tg4.ie/corp/pr/2009/0319-1.asp] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090322054828/http://www.tg4.ie/corp/pr/2009/0319-1.asp |date=22 March 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
Other major ratings successes for the channel include the All Ireland Ladies Football Final with 21% of all viewers tuned to that broadcast.
A series of [[Westerns]] has also proven very popular. On 25 April 2010, TG4's coverage of the [[National Football League (Ireland)|Allianz Football League]] Finals in [[Croke Park]] saw them become the most watched channel, with 650,000 viewers watching some of the games. The Division One final had an average audience of 220,000 viewers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tg4.ie/bearla/corp/pr/2010/0427-1.asp |title=VIEWING FIGURES FOR GAA BEO – ALLIANZ FOOTBALL LEAGUE FINALS 2010 |date=27 April 2010 |publisher=TG4 |accessdate=3 May 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100511212953/http://www.tg4.ie/bearla/corp/pr/2010/0427-1.asp |archivedate=11 May 2010 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some of the most popular programmes included: [[Glór Tíre]] ([[country and western]] reality competition) – 90–110,000; Rásaí na Gaillimhe (political comedy drama); [[Ros na Rún]] (soap opera), GAA Beo (GAA sport) – 50–100,000; [[Fíorscéal]], Cogar (documentary); [[Seacht]] (university drama); [[Nuacht TG4]] (news); [[7 Lá]] (weekly review); [[Paisean Faisean]] (dating programme), Feirm Factor (reality television); and An Jig Gig. These have had an audience reach of 3% to 12% of the total viewing audience, or 40,000 to 100,000 viewers.&lt;ref name="tg4.ie"/&gt;

==Programming==
{{Main article|List of programmes broadcast by TG4}}
TG4 has nurtured a reputation for innovative programming in film, arts, drama, documentaries, and sports. Much of TG4's programming is subtitled in English. The station has a [[teletext]] service called ''[[Téacs TG4]]''. Programmes broadcast on Saorview (not Sky or internet) are at times also subtitled in Irish.

===Imported programming===
TG4 broadcasts many popular US shows ranging from dramas to comedies. 

====As TnaG====
In the lead up to the transmissions of TnaG in the autumn of 1996, RTÉ tested transmissions with airings of ''[[Fawlty Towers]]''. The TnaG service provided little in the way of imports except for children's programming. TnaG provided airings of QVC during daytime hours. TnaG aired ''[[Northern Exposure]]''. They also dubbed into Irish a number of European, Welsh and Scottish programmes.

====As TG4====
TnaG re-branded in 1999 as TG4 and with this came a fresh schedule which included more imported programming. Highly critically acclaimed US programming such as ''[[Oz (TV series)|Oz]]'', ''[[Nip/Tuck]]'' and ''[[The Wire]]'' aired on the channel. During this time the extended out their range of adult and children's programming. Cula 4 na N-Og began airing from 07:00 for pre-school children with programmes such as ''Tar ag Spraoí Sesame'', ''[[Dora the Explorer]]'' and ''[[Wow! Wow! Wubbzy!]]'', Cula 4 airs ''[[SpongeBob SquarePants]]'', ''[[Ben 10]]'', ''[[The Muppet Show]]'', and others. In 2006 a strand called Ponc began airing with teen programming such as ''[[Pimp My Ride]]'', ''[[MTV Cribs]]'', ''[[8 Simple Rules]]'', ''[[America's Next Top Model]]'', ''[[What I Like About You (TV series)|What I Like About You]]'' and ''[[South Park]]''. Other series aired on the channel include ''[[Army Wives]]'', ''[[Cold Case (TV series)|Cold Case]]'',''[[Gossip Girl (TV series)|Gossip Girl]]'', ''[[One Tree Hill (TV series)|One Tree Hill]]'', ''[[The Starter Wife (miniseries)|The Starter Wife]]'', ''[[True Blood]]'', ''[[Two and a Half Men]]'', ''[[Vampire Diaries]]'', ''[[Without a Trace]]'', ''[[Carnivàle]]'', ''[[Curb Your Enthusiasm]]'', ''[[Eve (U.S. TV series)|Eve]]'', ''[[Everwood]]'', ''[[Invasion (U.S. TV series)|Invasion]]'', ''[[Lipstick Jungle (TV series)|Lipstick Jungle]]'', ''[[The O.C.]]'', and''[[Survivor (U.S. TV series)|Survivor]]''.

TG4 often premieres such shows before other European broadcasters.
TG4 previously held a long-term agreement with HBO to air the majority of their programmes on the channel. With the launch of [[Sky Atlantic]] in 2011, they now hold first rights to Irish and UK broadcasts of HBO shows. This means TG4 now broadcasts HBO programming at a much later date than in the past. TG4 held first rights to ''[[The Wire]]'', ''[[Oz (TV series)|Oz]]'', ''[[Deadwood (TV series)|Deadwood]]'', ''[[Generation Kill]]'', ''[[Six Feet Under (TV series)|Six Feet Under]]'', ''[[True Blood]]''. They also held an agreement with [[AMC (TV channel)|AMC]] to air ''[[Breaking Bad]]'' until the series concluded.

In Autumn 2013, the broadcaster started moving away from US imports instead focusing on successful European drama series from the Nordic countries. On 28 August 2013, TG$ announced its new schedule for autumn/winter 2013.&lt;ref name="tg4.ie1" /&gt; which relied on imports from internationally-acclaimed Nordic dramas such as [[Arne Dahl (TV series)|''Arne Dahl'']] from [[Sweden]], [[The Bridge (Danish/Swedish TV series)|''The Bridge'']] co-produced in Sweden and [[Denmark]] and Danish drama [[Borgen (TV series)|''Borgen'']].&lt;ref name="tg4.ie1"&gt;{{cite press release |url=http://www.tg4.ie/press/docs/TG4-PDF-Schedules/TG4-Autumn-2013-B.pdf |title=Autumn 2013 |publisher=TG4 |access-date=2013-08-28 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130908121347/http://www.tg4.ie/press/docs/TG4-PDF-Schedules/TG4-Autumn-2013-B.pdf |archive-date=2013-09-08 |df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; US imports include new seasons of ''[[Nashville (2012 TV series)|Nashville]]'', ''[[Breaking Bad]]'' (final season), ''[[True Blood]]'' and new dramas ''[[Justified (TV series)|Justified]]'' and ''[[Boss (TV series)|Boss]]''.&lt;ref name="tg4.ie1"/&gt;

TG4 continued to air ''Two and a Half Men'' up to the departure of [[Charlie Sheen]], when [[RTÉ Two]] began airing the series.

===News and current affairs===
All of TG4's news and current affairs programming is provided by [[Raidió Teilifís Éireann|RTÉ]] free of charge to the channel. In 1996 ''Nuacht TnaG'' started broadcasting from the TnaG Newsrooms in Baile na hAbhann. From 13 July 2009 all television broadcasts of ''[[Nuacht RTÉ]]'' broadcast from the Baile na hAbhann studios.&lt;ref name="RTÉ's 'Nuacht' Moves to West Coast"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iftn.ie/?act1=record&amp;only=1&amp;aid=73&amp;rid=4282318&amp;tpl=archnewshome&amp;force=1|title=RTÉ's 'Nuacht' Moves to West Coast - The Irish Film &amp; Television Network|work=iftn.ie}}&lt;/ref&gt; The main news anchor for ''Nuacht RTÉ'' is [[Siún Nic Gearailt]], who was the main news anchor for TG4 from 2002 to 2004, before moving to RTÉ.&lt;ref name="independent.ie"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.independent.ie/entertainment/tv-radio/heres-the-news-rtes-nuacht-shifts-base-to-west-coast-1818889.html|title=Here's the news RTÉ's Nuacht shifts base to west coast|work=Independent.ie}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Nuacht TnaG'' initially was broadcast at 22:00 each night, later moving to 20:00 and finally to 19:00 where it currently remains. From 1996 to 1998 [[Gráinne Seoige]] was the main news anchor for the channel, in 1998 she moved to [[TV3 (Ireland)|TV3]] to launch their main evening news where she remained until 2004. In 1998 [[Ailbhe Ó Monachain]] became TG4's main news anchor. With the rebranding of TnaG as TG4 the news service also renamed ''[[Nuacht TG4]]''. In 2004 [[Eimear Ní Chonaola]] became TG4's main news anchor. Since September 2010 Nóiméad Nuachta (News Minute) has broadcast each week day at 13:55.

Each Tuesday Night [[Páidí Ó Lionáird]] hosts their Current Affairs flagship show ''7 Lá'' (7 Days), the name derives from RTÉ's original Current Affairs programme ''7 Days''. Every Sunday night Eimear Ní Chonaola presents ''Timpeall na Tíre'', a round up of all the major stories of the week.

During the summer months they provide ''Féilte'' presented by Sinéad Ní Loideáin and Bríd Richardson. It takes a similar format to RTÉ's Nationwide, reporting on Festivals around Ireland during the summer months.

TG4 provides live coverage of [[Dáil Éireann]] each Wednesday and Thursday morning; as well as live coverage of the proceedings of key Dáil Committees from time to time.

TG4 has also provided coverage of the 1997, 2002, 2007, 2011 and 2016 general elections, coverage of European and local elections 2004, 2009 and 2014 and coverage of the annual national Budgets, and coverage of [[Údarás na Gaeltachta]] elections.

During the night TG4 airs a simulcast of [[France 24]] live from Paris.

===Sports===
The channel extensively covers Irish sports, such as the secondary [[Gaelic football]] and [[hurling]] competitions and club championships, and women's Gaelic football (it also broadcasts [[Pro14]]). These are events which generally do not appeal to a mass audience, but have a reasonably loyal following. Many of the sports that TG4 provide coverage to are sporting events that other Irish Broadcasters would not usually be interested in, they have gained a reputation for providing coverage to minority sporting events and repeat coverage to Rugby and Gaelic games under their programming strand ''Rugbaí Gold'' and ''GAA Gold'', showing highlights of classic games from the archives. ''[[Seó Spóirt]]'' broadcasts a round up of the weeks sporting news with a selected panel, it is hosted by [[Dara Ó Cinnéide]]. TG4 provided coverage of [[Volvo Ocean Race]] when it arrived in Galway in May 2009.&lt;ref name="VOLVO OCEAN RACE LIVE FROM GALWAY"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tg4.ie/bearla/corp/pr/2009/0518-1.asp |title=VOLVO OCEAN RACE LIVE FROM GALWAY |date=18 May 2009 |accessdate=2 June 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100218210500/http://www.tg4.ie/bearla/corp/pr/2009/0518-1.asp |archivedate=18 February 2010 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====GAA====
Since 2000 TG4 have sponsored [[ladies' Gaelic football]]'s All-Ireland competition under the name ''[[All-Ireland Senior Ladies' Football Championship|TG4 Ladies Football All-Ireland Championships]]'' (''Craobhacha TG4 i bPeil Na mBan'').&lt;ref name="TG4 Press Office"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tg4.ie/bearla/corp/pr/2010/0705-1.asp |title=LADIES FOOTBALL &amp; TG4 CELEBRATE 10 YEAR MILESTONE |date=5 July 2010 |publisher=TG4 Press Office |accessdate=11 July 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101027171638/http://www.tg4.ie/bearla/corp/pr/2010/0705-1.asp |archivedate=27 October 2010 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; They have provided live coverage of the men's Gaelic football league and round-up of the men's football and [[hurling]] championships during the summer months with their GAA round up programme called ''GAA'' – followed by the year it is broadcast, for example in 2011 it was called ''GAA 2011''. They also provide live coverage of the Under 21 All-Ireland competitions and club competitions. In late 2010, TG4 began to broadcast a new handball show, entitled ''The GAA Handball Show''.

====Rugby====
They previously had exclusive rights to show Magner's Rugby League from 2001 to 2004. In 2004 the Irish rights were sold to [[Setanta Sports]], where it was broadcast exclusively from 2004 to 2010. In 2010 TG4 won back the rights for [[Pro14|Pro12]] rugby union with [[Raidió Teilifís Éireann|RTÉ]], [[BBC Northern Ireland]], [[S4C]] and [[BBC Alba]].&lt;ref name="Clutton"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/rugbyunion/club/7813469/Celtic-Rugby-secure-improved-broadcast-deal-for-Magners-League-coverage.html|title=Celtic Rugby secure improved broadcast deal for Magners League coverage|last=Clutton|first=Graham|date=9 June 2010|publisher=telegraph.co.uk|accessdate=9 June 2010|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2011 TG4 took a major coup in taking away exclusive highlights of the Heineken Cup and Amlin Challenge Cup from RTÉ Sport. This led to TG4 having Live coverage of the new Pro14, which is what the Celtic League was rebranded in 2011 as well as highlights of the top matches in European rugby.

On top of this they bought Irish-language rights to the [[2011 Rugby World Cup]] whereby they had lucrative rights to re-run matches from the Rugby World Cup 2011 in the afternoon. Therefore, Setanta Ireland had all matches live, RTÉ had 13 live matches, including all-Irish matches and every match from the quarter finals onwards. TG4 re-ran all the big matches in the afternoon such as the Ireland v Australia match and England and Welsh match.

In 2014, the Irish language channel received praise for airing the [[Women's Rugby World Cup]]. TG4 provided coverage to all of the Irish matches as well as the final and semi-final.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tg4.ie/en/corporate/news-releases/2014/170714.html |title=News Releases - 17.07 - Women's Rugby World Cup to be broadcast LIVE on TG4  - TG4 - Irish language television channel - Teilifis Gaeilge |work=tg4.ie |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150510040058/http://www.tg4.ie/en/corporate/news-releases/2014/170714.html |archivedate=10 May 2015 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Football (Soccer)====
TG4 broadcasts highlights programme called ''Olé Olé'' for Spanish [[La Liga]] which it extended to include the [[Scottish Premier League]] in 1997. The series no longer airs on the channel.&lt;ref name="TnaG - One Year Old"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.medialive.ie/Comment/tnag.html|archive-url=https://archive.is/19980116050617/http://www.medialive.ie/Comment/tnag.html|dead-url=yes|archive-date=16 January 1998|title=TnaG – One Year Old|date=31 October 1997|publisher=Medialive.ie|accessdate=11 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;
TG4 held rights to [[League of Ireland]] with [[Raidió Teilifís Éireann|RTÉ]] and [[Setanta Sports]]. They have also broadcast UEFA Cup games in the past. TG4 did broadcast Friday night matches called ''Sacar Beo'' which showed League of Ireland matches and cup matches, but RTÉ and Setanta retain those rights now.

====Tennis====
TG4 broadcast exclusive Irish coverage of the [[Wimbledon championships]] tennis tournament. TG4's coverage of the tournament began in 2005, with their coverage being viewed by on average 300,000 viewers each day in 2008.&lt;ref name="http"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tg4.ie/bearla/corp/pr/2009/0620-1.asp |title=TG4'S SUCCESSFUL TENNIS COVERAGE TO CONTINUE WITH WIMBLEDON 2009 |date=20 June 2009 |publisher=TG4 |accessdate=2 June 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100218210514/http://www.tg4.ie/bearla/corp/pr/2009/0620-1.asp |archivedate=18 February 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; RTÉ commonly showed Wimbledon for a number of years before dropping the tournament in 2001. Ireland didn't show Wimbledon for a number of years until TG4 took over the coverage in 2005. This proved popular as coverage has been more than it ever was on RTÉ, and with Connor Niland becoming the first Irish player at Wimbledon in 30 years their coverage continues to grow. TG4'S coverage of the [[French Open|Roland Garros]] Tennis began in 2008, which started with just highlights of everyday and the finals live. This proved popular so now TG4 coverage begins with highlights until the final week of the tournament when live coverage begins.

====Cycling====

TG4's live coverage of the Tour de France began in 2005.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tg4.ie/bearla/corp/pr/2007/0628-1.asp |archive-url=https://archive.is/20130217204423/http://www.tg4.ie/bearla/corp/pr/2007/0628-1.asp |dead-url=yes |archive-date=17 February 2013 |title=TOUR DE FRANCE 2007 LIVE AND EXCLUSIVE ON TG4 |date=28 June 2007 |publisher=TG4 |accessdate=2 June 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Snooker====
TG4 for a number of years showed the Northern Ireland Trophy Snooker event from the Belfast Waterfront Hall. This started in 2005 and they showed every NI Trophy tournament until it was scrapped in 2009. This was advertised as their season of sport which started in 2005 and started with Wimbledon, le Tour de France and finished with the NI Trophy. This was firstly a non-ranking event, then became a ranking event. TG4 were the official broadcaster. Their coverage, ''Snucar Beo'', featured analysis from Irish players such as Fergal O'Brien and Ken Doherty and Northern Ireland players such as Patrick Wallace who were not Irish speakers and would provide analysis in English before the presenter would go back to talking in Irish. This is what usually happens in sports coverage on TG4 where links to cameras, reports and commentary are usually in Irish and interviews and analysis in rugby, football and snooker are usually in English.

===Entertainment===
Since its inception TG4 has provided a huge amount of light entertainment programming to its Irish speaking audience, such as the chat show ''[[Ardán]]'' and the fashion/dating show ''[[Paisean Faisean]]''.

''Cleamhnas'' ("Matchmaker") was TG4's first attempt at a [[wikt:blind date|blind date]] type of show. It was presented by [[Seán Bán Breathnach]] and later by Páidí Ó Lionáird. The audience would be introduced to the contestant looking for love and then to one of their parents (generally the father of a male contestant and the mother of a female contestant), then introduced to three suitors. The father or the mother would then ask the suitors questions about how they would treat their son or daughter. The presenter would then go into the audience to talk to the suitor's friends. It would then be up to the mother or father to choose which suitor would go on a blind date with their son or daughter.

This show ran for a number of years and was eventually replaced by ''[[Paisean Faisean]]'' where three boys/men select clothes for a girl, who would then choose the boy, based on the clothes that they had picked. This show was presented in the first three series by Aoife Ní Thuairisg, and in the fourth series by Blathnáid Nic Dhonnacha and Máiread Ni Chuaig. Máiread was replaced in 2008 by [[Síle Seoige]].

''Eochair An Ghrá'' ("Key to the Heart") started airing in 2008 and is similar in format to MTV's ''[[Room Raiders]]''.

The producers of ''Paisean Faisean'', [[Magma Films]], have since sold the rights to [[Zoo Productions]] who will produce the series for MTV under the title ''[[Style Date]]''.&lt;ref name="MTV Shops for 'Paisean Faisean'"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iftn.ie/news/?act1=record&amp;aid=73&amp;rid=4283010&amp;tpl=archnews&amp;only=1|title=MTV Shops for 'Paisean Faisean'|date=20 April 2010|publisher=Irish Film and Television Network|accessdate=20 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1996 TG4 aired ''Hollywood Anocht'' ("Hollywood Tonight"), a movie show presented by [[Síle Seoige]].

In 2004 TG4 launched a new strand of programming called ''Síle''. It was presented by Síle Ní Bhraonáin and ran from 17:30 to 19:00 each weeknight. It was similar in format to RTÉ's ''[[Two Tube]]''.

On 24 September 2007, TG4 began broadcasting ''[[South Park]]'' in Irish, on Síle, with the more adult content removed but also made available on Saturday nights. In 2009 Síle was replaced by'[[Cula 4|Ponc]].

They also had a number of quiz shows, including ''90 Seconds''. TG4 is a great way for students in Leaving Certificate or GCSCs or A-Levels who is studying Irish to learn from. It is a great resource and is encouraged by teacher. Research is shown that those who watch or listen to TG4 is deemed to have a better understanding of the language. As well as that, having Gaelic as a language, first or second is shown to better employment.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.tg4.ie/ga/|title=TG4 {{!}} Súil Eile|website=TG4|language=English|access-date=2017-11-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Geantraí'' is filmed around Ireland, with coverage of traditional music from many pubs around the country. Repeats of Irish traditional music programmes from RTÉ feature in the schedules such as ''The Pure Drop'' and ''Come West Along the Road''.

TG4 presents a number of six awards for Irish traditional music, celebrating and giving due recognition to the recordings, broadcasts and live performances of the recipients of the awards:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.gradam.ie/?page_id=274&amp;lang=en | title= Gradam Ceoil TG4 home page for Irish Music Awards | publisher= TG4 | accessdate = 26 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is set to organise a national final, produced by [[Adare Productions]], to find its representative at the contest. It will mark [[Ireland in the Junior Eurovision Song Contest|Ireland's]] first participation in the contest and the first time since [[Eurovision Song Contest 1972|1972]] that [[Irish language|Irish]] will be heard at a [[Eurovision (network)|Eurovision event]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.junioreurovision.tv/page/blog?id=ireland_to_debut_at_junior_eurovision_2014|title = Ireland to debut at Junior Eurovision!| publisher = EBU| accessdate = 23 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Reality television===
''SÓS'' (the Irish for "break", and the use of a pun on "[[SOS]]") was one of TG4s early attempts at reality television. It followed a group of contestants in the bleakness of the [[Connemara]] landscape, left with nothing and to fend for themselves. It was a television version of [[Gay Byrne]]'s radio experiment from the 1980s.

''Ní Gaelgoir Mé'' was TG4's version of [[S4C]]'s successful show, getting celebs to learn Irish for a week. It was presented by Aoife Ní Thuairisg.

In 2003 TG4 launched their search for Ireland's next top [[country and western]] singer. ''[[Glór Tíre]]'' is now into its 6th successful season on the channel. Often landing the top spot on their top ten shows, it has a regular audience of 100,000 viewers.

In 2008 TG4 launched their search for the best farmer in Ireland. ''[[Feirm Factor]]'' had 12 farmers competing with each other to see who was the best. The judging panel consisted of [[Maura Derrane]] (former ''[[Ireland AM]]'' presenter), [[Alan Dukes]] (former Minister for Agriculture) and Seán O Lionaird (dairy farmer from Cork). The second series of ''Feirm Factor'' was broadcast from January to March 2010. Welsh television station [[S4C]] has started broadcasting their own version of the show in 2010, called ''Fferm Ffactor''.

''Underdogs'' searched for the best amateur football team from groups of men and women with no previous experience in Minor or Senior GAA football. The judging panel consisted of Geraldine Feerick, Jarlath Burns and Éamon Ó Muircheartaigh.

TG4 commissioned two reality talent shows for the channel from Adare Productions. ''Glas Vegas'' has a similar format to ''America's Got Talent'' and ''The All Ireland Talent Show''. ''Nollig No. 1'' has a similar format to ''[[You're a Star]]'' as the judges search for a Christmas number one single. The 2008 winner was Mary Lee, she released the single "You'll Never Walk Alone", with the chorus 'as Gaeilge'.&lt;ref name="Mary Lee's winning video"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHU67jJQk4o|title=YouTube|work=youtube.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; In September 2009 another series from the same stable began the search for Ireland's best Irish dancing act, entitled An Jig Gig. The winners of this series were Irish Beats.&lt;ref name="youtube.com"&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20160411024451/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9rWrUCRepR0]&lt;/ref&gt; A fourth season of ''Glas Vegas'' began in January 2010.

TG4 have broadcast all series of the American version of ''[[Survivor (U.S. TV series)|Survivor]]'' with an Irish-language voice over.

In 2015, TG4 launched a new dating show called ''[[Pioc do Ride]]'' where contestants choose a date from three potential partners based only on their car.

===Drama===
In the early years TG4 gained critical acclaim&lt;ref&gt;C.U. Burn won "Spiorad na Féile", at the Panceltic Televisiona and Film Festival 1997.&lt;/ref&gt; for ''[[C.U. Burn]]'', a comedy series about a [[Donegal]] [[undertaker]], and ''Glenn Ceo'', a comedy about a small town [[Garda Síochána|Garda]] station in Donegal.

''[[Ros na Rún]]'' is TG4's long-running soap opera, which broadcast for 35 weeks of the year with two episodes each week. It is now in its 17th season on the channel. It airs Tuesday and Thursday at 20:30, with an [[omnibus (broadcast)|omnibus]] edition at 22:30 each Sunday.

TG4 have also supported many Irish filmmakers with their Lasair short film programme fund.

In 2006 TG4 commissioned ''Teenage Cics'', their first youth drama. Set during the 1980s in the Donegal [[Gaeltacht]], it follows the exploits of young students from Belfast going to the Gaeltacht to learn Irish. This was followed by their successful teen drama ''[[Aifric]]''.

In 2007 TG4 won major critical acclaim for their political satirical comedy ''The Running Mate'' and for the programme ''[[Seacht]]'' which follows the lives of seven college students in [[Belfast]].

Their drama series ''Rásaí na Gaillimhe'' (part funded by the [[Broadcasting Authority of Ireland|BAI]]'s Sound and Vision Fund) was a major hit for the channel, becoming their second most popular show just after ''[[Glór Tíre]]''. Set during the week of the [[Galway Races]], it is a drama-comedy starring [[Don Wycherley]], [[Ruth Bradley]], [[Olga Wherly]], [[Hughie McGarvey]] and [[Owen Roe]].

TG4 broadcast their first supernatural thriller on 13 January 2010. ''[[Na Cloigne]]'' ("Heads") is set in contemporary Ireland and revolves around a young couple (Nuala and Séan). Nuala is an artist with supernatural powers connecting her to the Otherworld and is faced with an adulterous boyfriend. Soon two young women Séan brings home for a nightcap are found dead.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tg4.ie/clar/cloigne/index.asp] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100123010100/http://www.tg4.ie/clar/cloigne/index.asp |date=23 January 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

TG4 continued with successful drama output with their comedy ''[[An Crisis]]'' ("The Crisis"), and ''[[Crisis Eile]]'' (in 2013). This series has poked fun at the Irish economic downturn and the effects on the promotion of the Irish language. The comedy initially centred around the office of the acting-chairman of ACT (An Chomhairle Teanga/The Language Commissioner) played by Risteárd Cooper as he fought to save the organisations from "[[An Bord Snip]] Nua".&lt;ref name="Iftn.ie"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iftn.ie/?act1=record&amp;aid=73&amp;rid=4282951&amp;tpl=archnewshome&amp;only=1&amp;force=1 |title=TG4 Introduces Office Drama 'An Crisis' &amp;#124; The Irish Film &amp; Television Network |publisher=Iftn.ie |date= |accessdate=9 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Praise for TG4 drama====
::"The reality is that Irish-language television dramas, no matter how acclaimed or however many awards they might win, are unlikely to show up in box set form in any DVD mega-store. TG4's viewership ranges from between 2 and 4 per cent of the population, enough to cost a politician an election but far too few viewers to send a show into the top 10 in the television ratings.
::A shame, because there are great things happening in the area. TG4's recent batch of mini-series Rasaí na Gaillimhe, Paddywhackery and Na Cloigne (not to mention Aifric, Seacht and long-running soap Ros na Rún) have featured outrageous plots and wacky characters, and dare to be politically incorrect: they get away with it because they are in Irish."&lt;ref name="The Irish edge in the ratings war"&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/features/2010/0319/1224266583816.html | work=The Irish Times | title=The Irish edge in the ratings war | date=3 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:: "the first episode of ''[[An Crisis]]'', a new six-parter from TG4, was laugh out loud funny – interspersed with a couple of knowing sniggers."&lt;ref name="Mind your language"&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/weekend/2010/0410/1224268015897.html | work=The Irish Times | title=Mind your language | date=4 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Children's television===
{{Main article|Cúla 4}}

In 1996, TnaG started its children's programming under the strand ''Cullabulla'' (taken from [[Hiberno-English]]). Since then they have renamed and extended the strand as Cúla4.

===Factual===
It also actively commissions documentaries such as the acclaimed and popular ''Amú'' series of travel programmes which launched the career of [[Hector Ó hEochagáin]], one of a number of TG4 presenters who have gone on to success at other channels. Others include newsreader [[Gráinne Seoige]]. As many of these programs are subtitled in English, they are often popular with recent immigrant populations, who find spoken English very fast on Irish produced television, as well as native Irish speakers.

They dub a French-Canadian documentary series under the name ''[[Fíorscéal|Fíor Scéal]]''. ''Nello'' was another well received travel show looking at life in middle America.

They have a documentary strand called ''Cogar''. ''Ealú'' (Escape) was a series which looked at prison escapes around Ireland. They repeat the RTÉ shows ''Leargas'' (a new magazine show) and ''Scannal'' (reports on scandals that hit Ireland).

===Re-dubbed programming===
In the early years of TG4 the service repeated the Welsh teenage drama series ''[[Jabas]]'' which was re-dubbed into Irish from Welsh. They also aired the French cartoon ''[[Bouli]]'' as part of their children's schedule. ''Jabas'' and ''Bouli'' had previously aired on [[RTÉ Television]]. Again the Welsh series ''[[Pris y Farchnad]]'' was translated into Irish under the title ''An Craiceann is a Luach''. In general however TG4 perceived that live action series aimed at adults re-dubbed into Irish was not an attractive proposition even for fluent Irish speakers, as is the cases for many bilingual northern European viewers.&lt;ref name="MacDubhghaill" /&gt;

Since its launch TG4 has significantly increased the number of re-dubbed children's programmes from 70 hours in its first year to 200 hours. TG4 only re-dub cartoons while live action series remain in English, such as the Australian drama ''[[H2O: Just Add Water|H2O]]'' and the American sitcom ''[[Lizzie McGuire]]''. TG4 have re-dubbed all of the [[Harry Potter (film series)|''Harry Potter'' films]] into Irish and broadcast them each Saturday from January to March 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tg4.ie/en/newsletter/tg4/february-2014.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-02-08 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140222173903/http://www.tg4.ie/en/newsletter/tg4/february-2014.html |archivedate=22 February 2014 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Some other live action children's movies such as ''[[Scooby-Doo (film)|Scooby-Doo]]'' have been re-dubbed into Irish.

===Film===
TG4 has a broad film policy which features a strong range of both independent and mainstream cinema. The channel places a strong emphasis on Irish films both in the Irish and English languages and European cinema which features films in French, German, Spanish, Italian, [[Polish language|Polish]], [[Danish language|Danish]] and [[Swedish language|Swedish]], among other languages. These films air under the strand ''Le Film''. TG4 regularly broadcast [[Western (genre)|Westerns]] under the strand ''An Western''.

Mainstream Hollywood cinema is represented by films from [[20th Century Fox]], [[Walt Disney Pictures]] and [[Warner Bros.]] among others. TG4 regularly broadcast such films on Tuesday Nights as part of their ''Scannán na Seachtaine'' ("Movie of the Week") strand. They sometimes re-dub children's films into Irish with English subtitles, the most notable being the ''[[Harry Potter]]'' films.

TG4 became the first channel to broadcast in full [[Stanley Kubrick]]'s classic ''[[A Clockwork Orange (film)|A Clockwork Orange]]'', a season of Kubrick's films followed, including the European television premiere of ''[[Eyes Wide Shut]]''. It also became one of the first channels in Europe to air the remastered director's cut version of ''[[The Exorcist (film)|The Exorcist]]'', even before the UK, as they were still only airing the edited version.

TG4 has created a '''TG4 Films''' department which invests in Irish-speaking films and mainstream Irish films such as the critically acclaimed [[Room (2015 film)|Room]].

===Subtitling and dubbing===
====Adult and prime time programming====
TG4 do not dub live action film or television programming into Irish. Some reality television programming have the English voice over replaced by Irish-language voice over (which is also subtitled in English), however all contestants and presenters are not re-dubbed. In the early years of TnaG the channel broadcast many European programmes with Irish dubbing however this policy has since stopped in favour of US programming in English. Some non-English-language films are also subtitled on teletext page 888 in Irish. Most Irish-language programmes are subtitled on screen in English, however no live programming (such as news and sport) is subtitled into English. Many Irish-language programmes are also subtitled on teletext page 888 in Irish.

====Children's and young people's programming====
Cúla 4, Cúla 4 na nÓg and Ponc do not have subtitles during live introductions. Many of the Irish-language cartoons are subtitled on page 888 for parents. TG4 broadcast all US teen programming in English, while Irish-language programming is subtitled on screen in English. TG4 have re-dubbed a number of Hollywood children's films into Irish.

==TG4 on demand==
As of 2011, TG4's [[video on demand]] (VOD) service is operated by TG4 Player.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tg4.ie/ie/tg4-player/tg4-player.html |title=TG4 – Irish language television channel – Teilifis Gaeilge – Féach ar TG4 Beo |publisher=Tg4.ie |date= |accessdate=9 April 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120408224519/http://www.tg4.ie/ie/tg4-player/tg4-player.html |archivedate=8 April 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Previously, the service was supplied by TG4 Beo; this service was launched in 2003 (and more recently in 2010) ahead of most European broadcasters.&lt;ref name="sbpost.ie"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sbpost.ie/mediaandmarketing/tg4-gets-the-picture-for-revamped-online-player-48202.html |title=The Sunday Business Post |publisher=Sbpost.ie |date= |access-date=9 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; TG4 Player allows viewers globally to watch TG4 live and watch previously aired programming on demand.

The new service is designed and managed by Nordic telecommunications company [[TeliaSonera]].  For certain programmes, a choice of subtitles in Irish and English is available.  According to TG4, the catch-up service has had 2 million downloads in a 12-month period.

==On-air identity and marketing==
TG4's on screen identity is very different from its counterparts', drawing upon the station's original slogan ''Súil Eile'' ("another view").

Its first idents were under their former name of TnaG. The music on TnaG's early ident sequences was produced by Irish composer [[Oisin Lunny]]. The opening sequence featured a number of Irish scenes from across the Island of Ireland, including Belfast and Dublin, and finished with a lighthouse, the light of which beamed the logo onto the screen. While the longer sequence went out at the beginning of each day and the end of the night, a shorter version went out before each programme. TnaG ran numerous marketing campaigns with this logo. Their main features were the difference of the Irish.One ad featured [[Red Lemonade]]. The slogan used in English was "Because we're Different" followed by the well known Irish slogan "Súil Eile". Another marketing campaign featured the stars of the channel asking the question "What more do you look for from a station?" They would be based at various stations such as train and space stations.

In 1999 with the onset of digital television, TnaG was rebranded as TG4 to strengthen the perception of the brand, from being niche Irish-language-only channel to mainstream channel with Irish-language programmes. The TG4 ident continued with the difference aspect of the channel, that provides an alternative view, the slogan ''Súil Eile'' translates literally as "another eye" but is also a pun in Irish meaning "a different view". The logo takes the G from the original logo, separates it from the T and the T loses its Celtic script look. The promotion of the channel from TnaG to TG4 was done with the use of a caterpillar growing into a butterfly.
During its 1999 rebrand TG4 would now feature a [[Digital on-screen graphic|DOG]] in the top right hand corner on all of TG4's programming, previously a TnaG DOG featured only on [[Oireachtas]] and [[QVC]] broadcasts.

The idents from 1999 to 2004 featured various people playing or messing in the background of the screen before the logo appear with the words Súil Eile below the logo.

In 2004, numerous new idents were developed for the station, featuring fairies, bridges, launderette, cars, wrestlers etc. TG4 promotions now feature the seasons Geimhreadh (Winter), Earrach (Spring), Samhradh (Summer) and Fómhar (Autumn). The opening ad break ident states ''Fan Linn'' ("stay with us") and the ad break ends with ''Seo Linn'' ("here we are"). In Autumn 2010 the season theme was dropped and replaced by a blue cube logo, the idents were updated with the TG4 logo animating up in a different way.

On Saturday 1 September 2012, TG4 launched its autumn scheduled. At this time a new look was introduced, a new ident was introduced and all the miscellaneous presentation was revamped. An updated logo was launched which is now coloured a dark grey. The identity focuses on the theme of Irish folklore including the [[Children of Lir]]. For the first time since the channels launch the on-screen logo is found on the top left hand corner. All the new graphics are created for HD ahead of TG4 HD's launch on UPC on 2 October 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tg4.ie/press/index.htm |title=TG4 Autumn Schedule 2014 |work=tg4.ie |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120904163816/http://www.tg4.ie/press/index.htm |archivedate=4 September 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In-vision continuity followed by TG4's new generic ident. The generic ident is also used after weather updates when a long ident is not required as the weather presenter acts as a continuity announcer at the end of the forecast announcing the next show.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tg4.ie/press/docs/TG4-PDF-Schedules/Fomhar-2012.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-09-02 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120916100454/http://www.tg4.ie/press/docs/TG4-PDF-Schedules/Fomhar-2012.pdf |archivedate=16 September 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Northern Ireland==
TG4 was originally only available in [[Northern Ireland]] via 'overspill' of the terrestrial signal from the [[Republic of Ireland]]. In the 1998 [[Belfast Agreement]] there was provision for TG4 (then TnaG) to be made available in Northern Ireland, along with increased recognition of the Irish language. Similarly, while TG4, along with the [[Republic of Ireland]]'s other terrestrial channels, are carried on [[Sky (UK &amp; Ireland)|Sky Ireland]] there, it was not available to Sky subscribers in Northern Ireland until 18 April 2005 or on [[Virgin Media|Virgin Media NI]] until February 2007.

In March 2005, TG4 began broadcasting from the [[Divis]] transmitter near [[Belfast]], as a result of agreement between the [[Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade (Ireland)|Department of Foreign Affairs]] and the [[Northern Ireland Office]]. However, because of overcrowding on the frequency bands, only a low power signal can be transmitted and reception is still unavailable in many areas, even in parts of Belfast. The channel is, however, available on cable, digital terrestrial television (Freeview) and on to Sky satellite subscribers. It is hoped that the channel can eventually be made available [[free-to-air]] on satellite.

On 1 February 2010, the [[Republic of Ireland]]'s Minister for Communications [[Eamon Ryan]] signed an agreement with the UK's [[Ben Bradshaw]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/ireland/2010/0202/1224263582384.html|title=RTÉ and TG4 to be freely available in North in 2012 | work=The Irish Times | date=2 February 2010|accessdate=7 February 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; This agreement enabled viewers within [[Northern Ireland]] to watch [[RTÉ One]], [[RTÉ Two]] and TG4 on a [[free-to-air]] basis as of 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.rte.ie/news/2010/0201/communications.html|title=RTÉ News: Ryan signs TG4 agreement with the British government|accessdate=7 February 2010 | date=1 February 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The agreement between both jurisdictions initially also guaranteed viewers within the Republic would be able to view [[BBC One Northern Ireland]] and [[BBC Two Northern Ireland]] on the Republic's free-to-air service [[Saorview]]. A cross-border initiative has always been on the agenda for the [[Green Party (Ireland)|Green Party]] in Ireland. However, it was later confirmed [[BBC Northern Ireland]] services will not be made available in the Republic and would be made available on a 'paid for' basis. As of 2018, BBC Northern Ireland services are still unavailable on Saorview.

==Main TG4 analogue UHF transmitters==
None of these transmitters are still in operation. All terrestrial transmissions are now via [[Saorview]] (Ireland) or Freeview HD (Northern Ireland)

'''''The Arts of War''''' and '''''The Arts of Peace''''' are [[bronze]], [[Gilding#Fire-gilding|fire-gilded]] statue groups on [[Lincoln Memorial|Lincoln Memorial Circle]] in [[West Potomac Park]] in [[Washington, D.C.]], in the United States. Commissioned in 1929 to complement the plaza constructed on the east side of the [[Lincoln Memorial]] as part of the [[Arlington Memorial Bridge]] approaches, their completion was delayed until 1939 for budgetary reasons. The models were placed into storage, and the statues not cast until 1950. They were erected in 1951, and repaired in 1974.

''The Arts of War'' were sculpted by [[Leo Friedlander]], an American sculptor. The [[Art Deco]] statuary group consists of two separate elements, '''''Valor''''' and '''''Sacrifice''''', which frame the entrance to Arlington Memorial Bridge.

''The Arts of Peace'' were sculpted by [[James Earle Fraser (sculptor)|James Earle Fraser]], an American sculptor. The [[Neoclassical architecture|Neoclassical]] statuary group consists of two separate elements, '''''Music and Harvest''''' and '''''Aspiration and Literature''''', which frame the entrance to the [[Rock Creek and Potomac Parkway]].

''The Arts of War'' and ''The Arts of Peace'' are contributing properties to the East and West Potomac Parks Historic District, which was added to the [[National Register of Historic Places]] on November 30, 1973.&lt;ref&gt;{{NRHP url|id=73000217|title=''East and West Potomac Parks''.

==Arlington Memorial Bridge and Rock Creek Parkway==
Congress first proposed a new bridge across the Potomac River, to be located somewhere between [[Constitution Avenue|B Street NW]] and [[Georgetown (Washington, D.C.)|Georgetown]] in 1886.&lt;ref&gt;Horne, p. 253.&lt;/ref&gt; Designs were proposed in 1886&lt;ref&gt;Myer, p. 142.&lt;/ref&gt; and 1898,&lt;ref name="Scott118"&gt;Scott, p. 118.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Approve Bridge Plan." ''Washington Post.'' April 10, 1900.&lt;/ref&gt; but neither was built.

A new location became available in 1890. When terrible floods hit the [[Washington, D.C.|District of Columbia]] in 1881, Congress enacted legislation to have the channel of the Potomac River deepened to help prevent future flooding. The silt would be used to [[land reclamation|reclaim]] the [[Tiber Creek]] [[Creek (tidal)|tidal inlet]], building up the land south of B Street and west of the [[Washington Monument]] grounds to a height great enough to act as a [[levee]].&lt;ref&gt;Tindall, p. 396; Gutheim and Lee, p. 94-97; Bednar, p. 47.&lt;/ref&gt; This work was largely complete by 1890, and designated [[West Potomac Park]] by Congress in 1897.&lt;ref&gt;Gutheim and Lee, p. 96-97.&lt;/ref&gt; During this same period, Columbia Island formed as an offshoot of [[Theodore Roosevelt Island|Analostan Island]].&lt;ref name="Office"&gt;Office of Conservation, Interpretation, and Use, p. 48-49; Moore and Jackson, p. 91.&lt;/ref&gt; The combination of reclaimed land and the emergence of a new island meant that it was now possible to build a bridge even further south than the previously proposed locations.

In 1902, the [[McMillan Plan|Senate Park Commission]] proposed in its so-called [[McMillan Plan]] that a bridge be built from the west end of West Potomac Park (which the commission successfully proposed as the site for the [[Lincoln Memorial]]) across the Potomac River to [[Arlington National Cemetery]]. This bridge would be aligned with [[Arlington House, The Robert E. Lee Memorial|Arlington House]], and act as memorial to the unification of the nation after the [[American Civil War]].&lt;ref&gt;Abrams, p. 117; Gutheim and Lee, p. 134-135.&lt;/ref&gt;

No action was taken to implement the Senate Park Commission's proposal for 12 years. Congress finally enacted the [[Public Buildings Act]] on March 4, 1913, which, among other things, created and funded an Arlington Memorial Bridge Commission (AMBC) whose purpose was to design the bridge and report back to Congress. But due to the onset of World War I, Congress appropriated no money for the commission's operation and it remained inactive.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=teUsAAAAYAAJ&amp;dq=Arlington%20Memorial%20Bridge%20Commission%201913&amp;pg=RA5-PA22#v=onepage&amp;q=Arlington%20Memorial%20Bridge%20Commission%201913&amp;f=false Sherrill, p. 21-25] Accessed 2013-04-15.&lt;/ref&gt;

Another proposal of the McMillan Plan was the creation of a number of [[parkway]]s throughout the D.C. area. Among these was the [[Rock Creek and Potomac Parkway]], which the Senate Park Commission suggested extend from E Street NW through [[Rock Creek Park]] to the [[National Zoological Park (United States)|National Zoological Park]].&lt;ref&gt;Gutheim and Lee, p. 138.&lt;/ref&gt; Congress authorized construction of the parkway in March 1913 and principal construction began in 1923.&lt;ref&gt;[http://lcweb2.loc.gov/pnp/habshaer/dc/dc0800/dc0806/data/dc0806data.pdf ''Rock Creek and Potomac Parkway. (Reservation Mo. 360) District of Columbia.'' HABS No. DC-697. Historic American Buildiiigs Survey. National Park Service. U.S. Department of the Interior. 1992, p. 1.] Accessed 2013-09-23.&lt;/ref&gt;

Congress finally authorized construction of the Arlington Memorial Bridge in 1925. Major traffic jams clogged the narrow and decrepit [[Highway Bridge (Potomac River)|Highway Bridge]] during the November 1921 dedication of the [[Tomb of the Unknowns|Tomb of the Unknown Soldier]] at Arlington National Cemetery, angering members of Congress and President [[Warren G. Harding]]. Recognizing the need for a new bridge, Congress enacted legislation in June 1922 funding at last the work of the Arlington Memorial Bridge Commission.&lt;ref&gt;Kohler, ''The Commission of Fine Arts: A Brief History, 1910-1995'', p. 16; "President Urges Funds for Bridge." ''Washington Post.'' January 14, 1922; Arlington Memorial Bridge Commission, p. 30.&lt;/ref&gt; The bridge commission on April 4, 1923, chose the architectural firm of [[McKim, Mead and White]] to design the structure. Architect William Mitchell Kendall was the lead designer.&lt;ref&gt;Kohler, ''The Commission of Fine Arts: A Brief History, 1910-1995'', p. 17.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;McKim, Mead and White only had responsibility for the architectural features of the bridge. The bridge commission turned over engineering aspects of the bridge to the [[United States Army Corps of Engineers]] on June 29, 1922. See: Christian, William Edmund. "The Arlington Memorial Bridge." ''Washington Post.'' November 1, 1925.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Initial designs for the eastern Arlington Memorial Bridge approaches===
[[File:Army Quartermaster Corps proposed Arlington Memorial Bridge and approaches - 1926.jpg|thumb|300px|Original approved plan of 1926 for the design of Arlington Memorial Bridge's eastern and western approaches, and the treatment for the entrance to Rock Creek and Potomac Parkway.]]
The [[United States Commission of Fine Arts]] (CFA) had the legal authority to review the design and architectural style of the bridge. Kendall submitted his first design for the structure to the CFA in May 1923. Kendall's plan envisioned a low, [[Neoclassical architecture|Neoclassical]] [[arch bridge]]. The eastern approaches&lt;ref&gt;An "approach" is the road, ramp, or other feature that allows pedestrians or vehicles to access the bridge.&lt;/ref&gt; in the District of Columbia consisted of linking the traffic circle around the Lincoln Memorial to the Potomac River by a granite and marble plaza and by monumental marble steps (the "watergate") leading from the plaza to the river's edge.

===Revised designs for the eastern Arlington Memorial Bridge approaches===
The AMBC and CFA were not only concerned with constructing a bridge, but ensuring that the approaches to the bridge were appropriate for a grand memorial.

The eastern approaches consisted of the end of the bridge, a plaza, a watergate, and the streets which approached the bridge. By November 1925, there were already some design changes as the details of Kendall's plan were worked out. The two columns for the center of the plaza were replaced with a fountain, and then the fountain, too, eliminated. For the bridge's entrance, the AMBC and CFA add two {{convert|40|ft|m|adj=on}} high square pylons inscribed on all four sides with images representing national unity and common purpose.&lt;ref name="Christian"&gt;Christian, William Edmund. "The Arlington Memorial Bridge." ''Washington Post.'' November 1, 1925.&lt;/ref&gt; The agencies also planned major changes to B Street NW, a major D.C. city street funneling traffic to the bridge. B Street would be significantly widened to turn it into a vast ceremonial avenue, and its length extended past 23rd Street NW to the shore of the Potomac River (where a new pedestrian overlook would be constructed).&lt;ref&gt;Widening and lengthening B Street was one of the first decisions made by the Arlington Memorial Bridge Commission. That plan was made in April 1924. See: "Bridge to Arlington to Cost $14,750,000 Asked As Memorial." ''Washington Post.'' April 10, 1924. The AMBC's vision for B Street gradually became grander, so that by late 1927 the road was seen as a rival to Pennsylvania Avenue NW. See: "Engineers Plan Impressive Water Approach to City." ''Washington Post.'' September 6, 1927. The Potomac River terminus to B Street was never formally adopted by the AMBC or CFA, but designed and implemented by the Corps of Engineers in the spring of 1930. See: Office of Public Buildings and Public Parks of the National Capital, 1930, p. 80-81.&lt;/ref&gt; B Street would also be connected to the Lincoln Memorial by a new road (now called Henry Bacon Drive).&lt;ref&gt;"Park Commission Accepts B Street Boulevard Plans." ''Washington Post.'' August 21, 1926; "B Street to Become 80-Foot Boulevard." ''Washington Post.'' September 18, 1926.&lt;/ref&gt; 23rd Street NW was also to be widened to provide a more grand north-south route to the Lincoln Memorial.&lt;ref name="FundsCut"&gt;"Lee Highway Bridge Fund Cut From Bill." ''Washington Post.'' March 3, 1932.&lt;/ref&gt;  These roads, along with Ohio Drive SW, came together west of the Lincoln Memorial, where Kendall proposed a large granite and marble traffic plaza across which traffic would flow.&lt;ref name="Christian" /&gt; A grand access to the Rock Creek and Potomac Parkway was of the bridge project as well. Two {{convert|40|ft|m|adj=on}} high square pylons with sculpture groups clustered about their bases were planned here as well, to complement those at the bridge.&lt;ref name="Christian" /&gt;

But in 1928 there was growing concern by members of the CFA that the pylons "complicated" the view toward the Lincoln Memorial from the bridge.&lt;ref&gt;Kohler, ''The Commission of Fine Arts: A Brief History, 1910-1995'', p. 23.&lt;/ref&gt; To assist the commission in making up its mind, the [[Signal Corps (United States Army)|Army Signal Corps]] produced life-size photographs of mock-ups of the pylons, and erected them on site for the CFA to view in late September 1928. Life-size photographs of shorter pylons were also viewed on-site, but the CFA concluded that both versions were too tall.&lt;ref&gt;"Arts Commission Approves Designs for Tech Stadium." ''Washington Post.'' September 28, 1928.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="StatuestoAdorn"&gt;"Statues to Adorn End of New Bridge." ''Washington Post.'' December 7, 1928.&lt;/ref&gt; Life-size photographs of equestrian statues were tried, and found to be acceptable.&lt;ref&gt;[http://hdl.handle.net/2027/mdp.39015068260325?urlappend=%3Bseq=36 Commission of Fine Arts, 1929, p. 18.] Accessed 2013-09-20.&lt;/ref&gt; In early December 1928, the CFA voted to order Kendall to change the pylons to equestrian statues.&lt;ref name="StatuestoAdorn" /&gt;

==Designing the statues==
[[File:Statuary mockup - Arlington Memorial Bridge - 1928-05-15.jpg|thumb|Statuary mock-ups on view during the construction of Arlington Memorial Bridge in May 1928.]]

===Hiring Fraser and Friedlander===
Kendall fought to retain the eastern terminus pylons even as the CFA continued to move ahead with plans for equestrian statuary. James Earle Fraser and Leo Friedlander were both commissioned to craft sculptures for the eastern terminus. Just how Fraser and Friedlander were chosen is unclear. Fraser's biographer, August Freundlich, and the National Park Service both say there was a competition.&lt;ref name="Freundlich140" /&gt;&lt;ref name="1929Office67"&gt;Office of Public Buildings and Public Parks of the National Capital, 1929, p. 67.&lt;/ref&gt; Freundlich puts the date of this competition as 1931, and gives no further details.&lt;ref name="Freundlich140" /&gt; This contradicts reports from the Office of Public Buildings and Public Parks and ''Washington Post'', which point to a selection process (not necessarily a competition) in 1929.&lt;ref name="1929Office67" /&gt;&lt;ref name="BidsAreSoughtfor" /&gt; Friedlander's biographers, however, state the artist was directly chosen in 1929.&lt;ref name="Rogers91" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Rosenkranz9"&gt;Rosenkranz, p. 9.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Some sources say that Fraser and Friedlander began work on their statues as early as 1925. See: Ziolkowski, p. 146; Taylor, p. 187; Carrier, p. 105; Scott and Lee, p. 105.&lt;/ref&gt; Museum curator Joel Rosenkranz says Friedlander's commission came directly from the firm of McKim, Mead &amp; White, and mentions no competition.&lt;ref name="Rosenkranz9" /&gt;

===Winning approval for the statue designs===
Government regulations required that sculptors create four versions of their work in plaster before final approval for construction could begin. These models had to be a one-sixteenth size, three-sixteenths size, half size, and full size.&lt;ref name="Rosenkranz9" /&gt; At least some preliminary designs for the equestrian statues (perhaps the one-sixteenth size models) were ready by June 1929.&lt;ref name="BidsAreSoughtfor"&gt;"Bids Are Sought For Bridge Work." ''Washington Post.'' June 2, 1929.&lt;/ref&gt; The CFA further discussed the equestrian sculptures at its meeting on December 11, 1929,&lt;ref&gt;"Fine Arts Commission Will Meet Tomorrow." ''Washington Post.'' December 11, 1929.&lt;/ref&gt; and Kendall gave up on his attempt to restore the pylons by the end of the year.&lt;ref name="Kohler24"&gt;Kohler, p. 24.&lt;/ref&gt;

By early 1930, Friedlander and Fraser were in discussion with the Army Corps of Engineers about the placement, erection, and pedestals for the two equestrian groups. The Corps also worked with McKim, Mead and White to study the area and determine the correct height and placement of the statues.&lt;ref&gt;Office of Public Buildings and Public Parks of the National Capital, 1930, p. 81-82.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Lieutenant colonel (United States)|Lieutenant Colonel]] [[Ulysses S. Grant III]] was a member of the Army Corps of Engineers as well as the Executive Officer of the AMBC. On July 1, 1930, Grant provided the CFA with a refinement of plans for the eastern approaches. At this meeting, the CFA again approved the designs for the equestrian statues. (This likely was approval to proceed to construction of the three-sixtheenth size models).&lt;ref&gt;"Municipal Center Changes Approved By Fine Arts Body.' ''Washington Post.'' July 2, 1930.&lt;/ref&gt;

The CFA approved yet another of Fraser and Friedlander's models in December 1930. (These were probably the three-sixteenths size models.) Details about the sculptures now began to emerge. Friedlander's two statuary groups were called ''Valor'' and ''Call to Arms'' (later retitled ''Sacrifice''). These two groups were to frame the entrance to Arlington Memorial Bridge.&lt;ref name="DesignApprovedForStatuaryWork" /&gt; Collectively, they were known as ''The Arts of War''. Both statuary groups were in a style of [[Art Deco]] known as "Delayed Deco".&lt;ref name="Capitman205"&gt;Capitman, et al., p. 205.&lt;/ref&gt; ''Valor'' was based on a study Friedlander had completed in 1915-1916 while a fellow at the [[American Academy in Rome]], while ''Sacrifice'' was created especially for the bridge commission.&lt;ref name="Rogers91"&gt;Rogers, p. 91.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Rosenkranz9" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Menconi47"&gt;Menconi, p. 47.&lt;/ref&gt; ''Sacrifice'', modeled in 1929, used the same figures as ''Valor'' but added the figure of a child.&lt;ref name="Rosenkranz9" /&gt; Because the AMBC specified that the statues were to be in white granite,&lt;ref name="DesignApprovedForStatuaryWork" /&gt; Friedlander had to change his design for ''Valor''. The sculpture was originally to be executed in bronze. But in order to support the weight of granite, a "web" of supports had to be sculpted beneath the horse.&lt;ref name="Rosenkranz9" /&gt;

Fraser's two statuary groups were titled ''Music and Harvest'' and ''Aspiration and Literature''.&lt;ref&gt;Molinari and Canepari, p. 15.&lt;/ref&gt; These two groups were to frame the entrance to the Rock Creek and Potomac Parkway. Collectively, they were known as ''The Arts of Peace''. Both statuary groups were in the Neoclassical style,&lt;ref name="Goode517" /&gt; although they also exhibited elements of [[Streamline Moderne|Art Moderne]].&lt;ref name="Freundlich139140"&gt;Freundlich, p. 139-140.&lt;/ref&gt;

Contracts (probably for full-size models) were let within a few days of the CFA's December 11, 1930, meeting.&lt;ref name="DesignApprovedForStatuaryWork"&gt;"Design Approved For Statuary Work." ''Washington Post.'' December 12, 1930.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Funding delays===
[[File:View of the approved 1926 plan for Arlington Memorial Bridge eastern approaches at the Lincoln Memorial.jpg|thumb|Original 1926 design for pylons rather than statuary at the Watergate Steps.]]
Additional plans for the placement of these statue groups were discussed in January 1931.&lt;ref&gt;"Arts Commission to Consider Plans." ''Washington Post.'' January 6, 1931.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="DesignIsApproved"&gt;"Design Is Approved for State Building." ''Washington Post.'' January 7, 1931.&lt;/ref&gt; Full-size photographic mock-ups of the bridge statuary (again made by the Army Signal Corps) were viwed on-site by the CFA on July 1, 1931.&lt;ref&gt;"Hospital Plans Win Fine Arts Approval." ''Washington Post.'' July 2, 1931.&lt;/ref&gt;

There was a sense by the CFA, however, that work on the statue groups was proceeding so well that the commission might approve the work before the full-size models were complete. Consequently, the commission visited Fraser's [[Westport, Connecticut]], studio on October 24, 1932, and approved his models.&lt;ref name="1935CFA25"&gt;[http://hdl.handle.net/2027/mdp.39015071561933?urlappend=%3Bseq=43 Commission of Fine Arts, 1935, p. 25.] Accessed 2013-09-20.&lt;/ref&gt;

As the half-size models were nearing completion in 1933,&lt;ref name="Menconi47" /&gt; the CFA suspended the project.&lt;ref name="Freundlich140"&gt;Freundlich, p. 140.&lt;/ref&gt; By now, the United States was in the depths of the [[Great Depression in the United States|Great Depression]]. The bridge was finished and slightly over budget, and Congress was increasingly unwilling to appropriate money for any further construction except the most critical remaining construction items (such as roadways). Obtaining funds for the costly granite and expensive carving was politically impossible.&lt;ref name="Freundlich140" /&gt; Furthermore, what funds were available were [[Impoundment of appropriated funds|impounded]] under the [[Economy Act|Economy Act of 1933]].&lt;ref name="ItalyOfferstoCast"&gt;"Italy Offers to Cast Bronze Statue Groups to Guard Entrances of Memorial Bridge." ''Washington Post.'' August 27, 1949.&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, the CFA wanted very much to proceed with the statues. With the full-size models already paid for, it asked the sculptors to finish their work. The Commission of Fine Arts visited Friedlander's [[White Plains, New York]], studio on October 14, 1933, and approved his models.&lt;ref name="1935CFA25" /&gt;

By October 1933, the CFA had also resolved other aesthetic issues regarding the statues. In addition to approving the height of the statues (each would be {{convert|16|ft|m}} tall), it set the height of the pedestals at {{convert|13|ft|m}} and the height of the [[plinth]] beneath the statues at {{convert|1|ft|m}}.&lt;ref&gt;"Two Bridge Statue Models Approved." ''Washington Post.'' October 17, 1933.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="1940CFA63"&gt;[http://hdl.handle.net/2027/mdp.39015068260341?urlappend=%3Bseq=79 Commission of Fine Arts, 1940, p. 63.] Accessed 2013-09-20.&lt;/ref&gt; Granite from Mount Airy, North Carolina, would be used for the plinths and pedestals.&lt;ref name="1940CFA63" /&gt;

===The switch to bronze from granite===
[[File:James Earle Fraser.jpg|thumb|James Earle Fraser (shown here in his studio) and his former student, Edward Minazolli, traveled to Italy to supervise the casting and gilding.]]
With little urgency, Fraser and Friedlander went ahead at a slow pace on their work.&lt;ref&gt;"Revised Plan for Chain Bridge Wins Approval of Arts Group." ''Washington Post.'' December 31, 1936.&lt;/ref&gt; Partial funding for the granite statues was secured in 1935, but these monies were again impounded.&lt;ref name="1940CFA63" /&gt; The CFA asked Congress to approve funding for the statues in 1937,&lt;ref&gt;"Arlington Span Statuary Asked By Arts Group." ''Washington Post.'' November 7, 1937.&lt;/ref&gt; but this effort was unsuccessful. Additional efforts to win funding from Congress were made in 1938 and 1939, but also failed.&lt;ref name="GoldenHorses" /&gt; Fraser and Friedlander completed work on their full-size models in 1939.&lt;ref name="Freundlich140" /&gt;

With the full-size plasters ready, the CFA made another push for funds in 1940. Money appeared to be available in the National Park Service budget, but bids for the granite and carving came in $70,000 too high. James Earle Fraser then suggested that the statues be cast in bronze or Benedict nickel&lt;ref name="1944CFA49"&gt;[http://hdl.handle.net/2027/mdp.39015055273398?urlappend=%3Bseq=411 Commission of Fine Arts, 1944, p. 49.] Accessed 2013-09-20.&lt;/ref&gt; (an [[alloy]] of [[copper]] and [[nickel]]).&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=CPo6AAAAMAAJ&amp;lpg=PA161&amp;ots=qmoQGxtOGx&amp;dq=%22benedict%20nickel%22&amp;pg=PA160#v=onepage&amp;q=%22benedict%20nickel%22&amp;f=false Loomis, F.J. "Electrolysis and Other Defects Inherent in Condenser Tubes." ''The Rudder.'' 12:3 (March 1901): 160-161.] Accessed 2013-09-20.&lt;/ref&gt; Friedlander and the CFA agreed with this suggestion, and in August 1941 both sculptors signed contracts to redesign their models for casting in bronze.&lt;ref name="Rosenkranz9" /&gt;&lt;ref name="1944CFA49" /&gt; For Friedlander, this meant removing the "web" supports beneath his horses and returning to his original design.&lt;ref name="Rosenkranz9" /&gt;

Lobbying Congress for money halted for a time while work proceeded on Friedlander's revisions. Money for the project became unavailable during World War II, and bronze was diverted to the war effort.

===Search for foundries===
On January 23, 1946, CFA member and sculptor [[Lee Lawrie]] visited the Friedlander workshop with an official of the National Park Service. They inspected the revised full-size model, and reported to the CFA on January 26 that it was satisfactory.&lt;ref name="1948CFA49"&gt;[http://hdl.handle.net/2027/mdp.39015068260358?urlappend=%3Bseq=63 Commission of Fine Arts, 1948, p. 49.] Accessed 2013-09-20.&lt;/ref&gt; By this time, however, the cost of casting in bronze had nearly doubled in the post-war period to more than $100,000 per statue.&lt;ref name="Freundlich140" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Rosenkranz9" /&gt; The National Capital Region of the National Park Service agreed to dismantle and store the Fraser and Friedlander models until such time as the prices for casting were more reasonable.&lt;ref name="Freundlich140" /&gt;&lt;ref name="1948CFA51"&gt;[http://hdl.handle.net/2027/mdp.39015068260358?urlappend=%3Bseq=65 Commission of Fine Arts, 1948, p. 51.] Accessed 2013-09-20.&lt;/ref&gt; In the summer of 1947, Fraser surveyed foundries in Europe to see which might offer the least expensive casting. The single response indicated that it would cost $212,000 to cast both of his statues.&lt;ref name="1948CFA51" /&gt; The Fraser and Friedlander statues were re-approved by the CFA in October 1947.&lt;ref name="Freundlich140" /&gt;

In January 1948, the National Park Service informed the CFA that about $1 million in authorized funds existed to complete Arlington Memorial Bridge.&lt;ref name="1948CFA51" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;In the American federal budgeting system, a program must first be "authorized" to exist. The authorization legislation can originate in either the House or the Senate, and usually specifies an upper limit on the amount of money that can be spent under the program.  This upper limit is known as the "authorization". No money is actually budgeted, however, until an appropriation is made. Appropriation bills must originate in the House of Representatives, although the Senate can amend any appropriations bill received from the House and expand its scope. See: LeLoup, p. 23-26.&lt;/ref&gt; Fraser reported on his summer 1947 survey of foundry costs, and at the urging of the Park Service the CFA submitted legislation to Congress asking for an initial $185,000 appropriation to begin the casting process.&lt;ref name="1948CFA51" /&gt; But the legislation did not pass in the first session of the [[80th United States Congress|80th Congress]].&lt;ref name="GoldenHorses" /&gt;

At the CFA's meeting on September 13, 1948, the commission again discussed how to win an appropriation to complete the statue groups. The National Park made a survey American foundries, and told the CFA that few had been converted from war work back to art casting. Furthermore, only one foundry was large enough to handle the work, and it demanded an [[escalator clause]] in its contract. The park service expressed its opinion that an escalator clause would not be approved by federal budget officials. Members of Congress suggested, however, that a European nation be asked to cast the statues as part of the [[Marshall Plan]]. There was widespread agreement among CFA members and the sculptors that this should be pursued.&lt;ref name="1959CFA52"&gt;[http://hdl.handle.net/2027/mdp.39015055273380?urlappend=%3Bseq=66 Commission of Fine Arts, 1959, p. 52.] Accessed 2013-09-20.&lt;/ref&gt;

Meanwhile, on February 20, 1950, the CFA began reconsidering the height of the statues' pedestals. The previously approved pedestals were deemed to be too low, and the CFA considered raising them to {{convert|16|ft|m}}. The Park Service made life-size silhouettes of the statues, and the CFA made a site visit to the plaza on the east side of the Lincoln Memorial to view the mock-ups. After viewing the silhouettes, the CFA agreed not to make any changes to the pedestals' height. The commission did, however, begin to discuss what inscriptions might be made on the pedestals.&lt;ref name="1959CFA52" /&gt;

===Casting in Italy===
[[File:Alcide de Gasperi 2.jpg|thumb|left|175px|Italian Prime Minister Alcide De Gasperi attended the statues' dedication in the United States.]]
In 1949, the government of Italy expressed its interest in using Marshall Plan funds to cast the four Arlington Memorial Bridge statues. In October, officials of the National Park Service and sculptors Fraser and Friedlander traveled to Italy to inspect various foundries and negotiate a deal.&lt;ref&gt;[http://hdl.handle.net/2027/mdp.39015055273380?urlappend=%3Bseq=66 Commission of Fine Arts, 1959, p. 52, 55.] Accessed 2013-09-20.&lt;/ref&gt;

An agreement was reached, and casting began in 1950. The plaster models arrived in Italy in January. Customs officials, however, were not made aware of how to properly house and care for them, and the plaster statues stood outdoors in cold, snowy, and rainy weather for several weeks.  Fraser's student, Edward Minazolli, traveled to Italy to help oversee the casting process, and discovered the models had deteriorated. With Fraser and Friedlander's permission, he made repairs to the plaster models (taking care to not offend the Italians or make them aware that they had inadvertently damaged them).&lt;ref&gt;Freundlich, p. 141.&lt;/ref&gt;

The A. Bruni Foundry in [[Rome]] and the Fonderia Lagana in [[Naples]] cast the sculptures&lt;ref name="Freundlich140" /&gt; using the [[lost-wax casting]] process.&lt;ref name="Passaglia159" /&gt; The foundries intended to use fire-gilding to finish the statues. Fire-gilding is a process in which [[gold leaf]] and [[Mercury (element)|mercury]] are applied to the bronze. Fire is applied to the area, which causes the gold to adhere to the bronze and the mercury to evaporate.&lt;ref name="Freundlich140" /&gt; But several problems were encountered during both the casting and gilding phases. The foundries wanted to use joints that while less expensive to cast would not wear well, and the sculptors were forced to intervene to achieve the required quality. Samples of fire-gilded bronze were shipped to the United States, where it was discovered the color was too bright. This required both sculptors to intervene again to achieve the correct color. Minzolli then visited the foundries to check on the castings. He discovered that the Bruni foundry did excellent casting, but its gilding was poor. The casting at the Fonderia Lagana foundry was also of high quality, but not quite as good as that in Rome. Its gilding was better than the Roman foundry's, however. Fraser looked into moving part of the casting work to a foundry in [[Milan]] and the [[Ferdinando Marinelli Artistic Foundry]] in [[Florence]].&lt;ref&gt;Freundlich, p. 142.&lt;/ref&gt;  The Milan foundry's work was at least as good as that done at the Neapolitan foundry. The Florentine foundry, however, did good casting work but exceptionally poor gilding. In the end, the gilding work on ''Valor'' was done in Milan and ''Sacrifice'' in Florence. The Rome foundry did both casting and gilding on ''Aspiration and Literature'', while Naples did casting and gilding for ''Music and Harvest''.&lt;ref name="Passaglia159"&gt;Passaglia, p. 159.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Freundlich, p. 141-142.&lt;/ref&gt; More than {{convert|100|lb|kg}} of [[Carat (purity)|24-karat]] gold (worth ${{formatnum:{{inflation|US|58000|1951}}}} in {{CURRENTYEAR}}) was used in the gilding process.&lt;ref name="GoldenHorses"&gt;"Golden Horses Dedication Set."

===Dedication===
The four statue groups were finished in late April 1951. They were unveiled on May 3 and then displayed at several Italian [[fair]]s before being shipped to the United States.&lt;ref&gt;"Memorial Bridge Statues Finished; Gift From Italy." ''Washington Post.'' April 27, 1951.&lt;/ref&gt; When ''Valor'' was moved through the streets of Milan, huge crowds followed, shouting, "The Reinaissance has returned! The Reinaissance has returned!"&lt;ref name="Goode514"&gt;Goode, p. 514.&lt;/ref&gt; The four statue groups were transported from Milan to [[Norfolk, Virginia]], aboard the [[SS Rice Victory|SS ''Rice Victory'']], then placed aboard a [[United States Navy]] barge and taken up the Potomac River to Washington, D.C.&lt;ref name="FourBronzeHeroes" /&gt;

The four statue groups were dedicated on Wednesday, September 26, 1951. The [[United States Army Band]] and Italian [[opera]] singer [[Ezio Pinza]] provided music at the dedication. [[United States Secretary of the Interior|Secretary of the Interior]] [[Oscar L. Chapman]] presided over the event. [[United States Secretary of State|Secretary of State]] [[Dean Acheson]] introduced the [[Prime Minister of Italy]], [[Alcide De Gasperi]], who offered the statues to the United States as a gift of the Italian people in gratitude for American assistance in rebuilding Italy after World War II. President [[Harry S. Truman]] accepted the statues, which were then unveiled by the wives of James Earle Fraser and Leo Friedlander.&lt;ref name="GoldenHorses" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Folliard" /&gt; In his remarks following the unveiling, President Truman pledged to remove certain military, economic, and other constraints on Italy imposed by a [[Treaty of Peace with Italy, 1947|1947 peace treaty]].&lt;ref name="Folliard" /&gt;

''The Arts of War'' consists of two statue groups, ''Valor'' and ''Sacrifice''. Both are in a style of Art Deco known as "Delayed Deco".&lt;ref name="Capitman205" /&gt; Facing Arlington Memorial Bridge from the District of Columbia, ''Valor'' is on the left and ''Sacrifice'' is on the right. ''Valor'' consists of a bearded, muscular male nude symbolic of [[Mars (mythology)|Mars]], the [[Ancient Rome|ancient Roman]] [[god of war]]. To his left is a semi-nude female striding forward, a shield attached to her left, trailing forearm. ''Sacrifice'' shows the same figures, but in different poses. The nude male now holds a small child in his arms, his head bowed. The semi-nude female is to his right, her back to him and the horse. But her head is turned backward to look at the rider, her right arm reaching up to touch his right elbow.&lt;ref name="Goode514" /&gt;

''The Arts of Peace'' (also known as ''The Peaceful Arts'') consists of two statue groups, ''Music and Harvest'' and ''Aspiration and Literature''. Both are in the Neoclassical style,&lt;ref name="Goode517" /&gt; although they also exhibit elements of Art Moderne.&lt;ref name="Freundlich139140" /&gt; Facing Rock Creek Parkway from the Lincoln Memorial traffic circle, ''Aspiration and Literature'' is on the left and ''Music and Harvest'' is on the right.&lt;ref&gt;National Park Service, p. 9.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Pegasus]], the mythological source of inspiration and poetry, is the centerpiece of both statue groups. ''Aspiration and Literature'' consists of a nude male on Pegasus' right with a [[toga]] over his left shoulder and an open book in his trailing right hand (symbolic of literature), and  on Pegasus' left a nude male (both shoulders draped with a toga) aiming a bow backward (symbolic of aspiration). A [[Serpent (symbolism)|serpent]] trails behind the personification of literature, symbolizing wisdom and knowledge. ''Music and Harvest'' consists of a nude male on Pegasus' right holding a [[sickle]] and carrying a sheaf of cut [[wheat]] over his shoulder (symbolic of harvest), and a semi-nude female on Pegasus' left holding a [[harp]] in her trailing left hand (symbolic of music). Behind the woman is a turtle, symbolizing the belief that "art is long and time is fleeting".&lt;ref name="Freundlich139140" /&gt;

As completed, each statue group weighed about {{convert|80000|lb|kg}}.&lt;ref name="FourBronzeHeroes" /&gt; Each was {{convert|19|ft|m}} high,&lt;ref name="Rosenkranz9" /&gt;&lt;ref name="FourBronzeHeroes" /&gt; {{convert|16|ft|m}} long, and {{convert|8|ft|m}} wide.&lt;ref name="1959CFA55"&gt;[http://hdl.handle.net/2027/mdp.39015055273380?urlappend=%3Bseq=66 Commission of Fine Arts, 1959, p. 55.] Accessed 2013-09-20.&lt;/ref&gt; The pieces of ''Sacrifice'' and ''Valor'' were welded together.&lt;ref name="Ogburn171" /&gt; ''Music and Harvest'' and ''Aspiration and Literature'' were bolted together. Flanges were cast on the interior, and steel bolts used to hold the pieces together.&lt;ref name="Ogburn171" /&gt; ''Music and Harvest'' is different from the others in that it also has a central seam along which many other pieces are bolted.&lt;ref name="Ogburn171" /&gt; Perforated plates of steel (known as "tie-plates") are bolted to this seam as well.&lt;ref&gt;Ogburn, et al., p. 171-172.&lt;/ref&gt; Steel bolts were used in all the statues to join pieces together,&lt;ref&gt;Some bronze and even a few brass bolts were also used. See: Ogburn, et al., p. 172.&lt;/ref&gt; and steel angle irons were used in each statue's interior to make them more rigid.&lt;ref name="Passaglia160" /&gt; The total cost for transporting, casting, and gilding the four groups was $300,000.&lt;ref name="ItalyOfferstoCast" /&gt; Fraser and Friedlander were each paid $107,000 for their work.&lt;ref name="Devree34"&gt;Devree, p. 34.&lt;/ref&gt;

Each granite pedestal is hollow, and open to the bare earth inside.&lt;ref name="Passaglia160" /&gt; The statues were originally anchored to their pedestals by a steel framework covered in [[bitumen]].&lt;ref name="Ogburn172"&gt;Ogburn, et al., p. 172.&lt;/ref&gt; Each pedestal has 36 gilded bronze stars spaced equidistantly at the top, which represent the number of states in the United States at the time of the [[American Civil War]]. At the front of each pedestal is a classical wreath, designed and carved by Vincent Tonelli&lt;ref name="Goode517"&gt;Goode, p. 517.&lt;/ref&gt; (who also co-carved the ''[[Trylon of Freedom]]'' in front of the [[E. Barrett Prettyman United States Courthouse]]). Art curator Susan Menconi said in 1990 that ''The Arts of War'' and ''The Arts of Peace'' were the largest equestrian sculptures in the United States.&lt;ref name="Menconi47" /&gt;

''Valor'' may be entered through a hatch in the rear of the horse, and the interior of the pedestal accessed through the horse's legs for maintenance and repair. The other three statues are accessed through hatches in the top of the pedestals.&lt;ref name="Ogburn171"&gt;Ogburn, et al., p. 171.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Critical reception===
The sculptural groups were not well-received critically when first mounted. As they were being cast, some local citizens felt they would be a poor aesthetic fit with the Lincoln Memorial and unsuccessfully tried to have them moved to another location.&lt;ref name="GoldenHorses" /&gt; Writing in 1955, art critic Charlotte Devree singled out [[Felix de Weldon]]'s [[Marine Corps War Memorial]] and the Fraser and Friedlander statues for harsh critical assessments.&lt;ref name="Devree34" /&gt; She called them "academic cliches"&lt;ref&gt;Devree, p. 37.&lt;/ref&gt; and accused Fraser and Friedlander of "esthetic numbness".&lt;ref name="Devree34" /&gt; The ''Washington Post'' also had unkind words for them. The newspaper editorialized that they were created and approved by a "tight little clique of uninspired and not particularly gifted academicians who constitute the National Sculpture Society".&lt;ref&gt;"Impatience on a Monument." ''Washington Post.'' April 5, 1955.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Conservation and refurbishment==

===1970 repairs===
[[File:Sacrifice - Arlington Memorial Bridge - Leo Friedlander 1951 - Washington DC - 2013-04-09.jpg|thumb|300px|''Sacrifice'' in 2013.]]
By 1970, all four statues were in need of significant repair. A significant amount of the gilding on all four statues no longer adhered to the bronze, as well as exhibiting a large number of cracks and holes.&lt;ref&gt;Ogburn, et al., p. 168-169.&lt;/ref&gt; Both of the Fraser pieces were in particularly poor shape, with ''Music and Harvest'' more so.&lt;ref&gt;Ogburn, et al., p. 168.&lt;/ref&gt; National Park Service asked the [[National Bureau of Standards]] for advice on what to do.&lt;ref name="Passaglia159" /&gt; The bureau made five suggestions:
#Do nothing;
#Sandblast the gilding off and allowing a natural blue-green oxidized bronze patina to form on the statues;
#Sandblast the gilding off and paint the statues with gold gilt paint (which would need to be repeated every five years);
#Clean the surfaces and applying gold leaf rather the gilding to the statues; or
#Clean the surfaces and then regild them using the [[Electroplating#Brush electroplating|brush electroplate]] technique.
The latter three options required dismounting the sculptures, repairing them, repairing the pedestals, and then remounting the statues.&lt;ref name="Passaglia160"&gt;Passaglia, p. 160.&lt;/ref&gt;

The National Park Service chose to refinish the statues using brush electroplating. Workers discovered that because the interior of each pedestal was exposed to bare earth, excessive condensation built up inside the hollow statues.&lt;ref name="Passaglia160" /&gt; Additionally, the statues had not been completely seated on their plinths, and additional moisture worked its way inside through the poorly sealed joint.&lt;ref name="Passaglia160"&gt;Passaglia, p. 160.&lt;/ref&gt; Extreme temperature changes (due to daytime heating and nighttime cooling of the bronze) and proximity to the river also led to extensive condensation inside the statures.&lt;ref name="Ogburn171" /&gt; Workers found the interior of each statue damp, even wet, and water pooled in every recess.&lt;ref name="Ogburn171" /&gt; The moisture build-up created tremendous [[galvanic corrosion]] inside the sculptures. The steel joint bolts were so extensively corroded that some had almost completely disintegrated, and many of the steel angle irons were close to failure. National Bureau of Standards workers believed all four statues were on the verge of structural collapse.&lt;ref name="Passaglia160" /&gt; The corrosion problem was worsened by the presence of [[gypsum]]. Gypsum was used to make the molds from which the bronze was cast. But the gypsum was never completely cleaned from the interior of the two ''The Arts of Peace'' statues, leading to additional corrosion in these pieces.&lt;ref name="Ogburn171" /&gt; The corrosion problems were solved by removing the steel bolts and angle irons and replacing them with bronze components,&lt;ref name="Passaglia160" /&gt; and by cleaning as much gypsum as possible from the statue interiors.&lt;ref name="Passaglia161"&gt;Passaglia, p. 161.&lt;/ref&gt; More than 1,000 brass bolts were used in ''Music and Harvest'' and ''Aspiration and Literature'' alone.&lt;ref name="Ogburn173" /&gt;

The steel anchors holding the statues to the pedestals were also in poor shape. Some of the bitumen flaked off, exposing the bare steel to corrosion and permitting corrosion to occur under the coating. Many of the [[tie rod]]s were close to structural collapse, and one had completely failed.&lt;ref name="Ogburn172" /&gt; The steel anchor frames were removed, and brass framing installed.&lt;ref name="Ogburn173" /&gt;

The castings, too, had problems. Several pieces had cracked, in some cases severely.&lt;ref name="Passaglia161" /&gt; ''Music and Harvest'' had a {{convert|6.6|ft|m|adj=on}} long crack that extended more than halfway around the statue.&lt;ref&gt;Ogburn, et al., p. 169-170.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Welding]] proved to be an unsatisfactory solution to the cracks because the bronze could not be heated to a temperature high enough to accept welding. Where possible, cracks were filled using a [[solder]] composed of 97 percent [[tin]] and 3 percent [[silver]]. Where the widest cracks occurred, interior straps were applied to help keep the pieces together.&lt;ref name="Passaglia161" /&gt;

[[File:Arts of Peace - crack held together by tie plates and bolt - 1971.jpg|thumb|A crack in one of ''The Arts of Peace'' statues, repaired with tie-plates and bolts.]]
Pitting was another problem affecting the castings. When conservators entered the pedestals, they could see hundreds of pinpricks of light and long cracks in the bronze.&lt;ref name="Ogburn171" /&gt; After sandblasting removed the original gilding, the exterior surface of the bronze was discovered to be full of pits. Few of pits showed galvanic corrosion, which indicatied they were present before the statues were gilded.&lt;ref name="Ogburn169"&gt;Ogburn, et al., p. 169.&lt;/ref&gt; The two Fraser statues were of the poorest casting quality. The bronze on all four statues was quite porous, allowing water to seep into the metal and cause corrosion.  But there were also hundreds of pits dotting the surface of each statue, ranging in size from less than {{convert|0.04|in|mm}} to {{convert|0.12|to|0.16|in|mm}}. In some cases, the pits were so deep that they pierced the wall of the statue.  The holes and the deepest pits were drilled out and filled with either silver-tin solder or bronze screws (which were then cut off and sanded down). But this left hundreds of small pits which could not be repaired. Covering them with gold gild was not a workable solution. A different solution was needed. Once the original gilding was removed, a 500 microinch (12.700 micrometer) [[nickel]] coating was applied to the bronze using brush electroplating. Then a 160 microinch (4.0640 micrometer) coating of gold was applied in the same manner.&lt;ref name="Passaglia161" /&gt; Where there was solder, or in places which were particularly difficult to coat properly, a 393.7 microinch (10.0 micrometer) coating of copper was applied first.&lt;ref&gt;Ogburn, et al., p. 175.&lt;/ref&gt; An effort was made to building up a nickel and gold coat more thickly over pitted areas.&lt;ref name="Ogburn176"&gt;Ogburn, et al., p. 176.&lt;/ref&gt; A brand-name lacquer (Incralac), specially formulated for protecting bronze, was then applied to the entire surface. The lacquer was expected to last about five years.&lt;ref name="Passaglia161" /&gt;

Restoration of ''Music and Harvest'' and ''Aspiration and Literature'' occurred in the fall of 1971. ''Valor'' and ''Sacrifice'' were restored beginning in November 1972.&lt;ref name="Ogburn173"&gt;Ogburn, et al., p. 173.&lt;/ref&gt; The process of sandblasting, repairing, and regilding each pair of statues took 60 days.&lt;ref name="Passaglia162"&gt;Passaglia, p. 162.&lt;/ref&gt;

Some discoloration of the pedestals and statues occurred after reinstallation. The National Bureau of Standards discovered that dark substance was electroplating solution had not been thoroughly removed. It was washed off, and the problem fixed.&lt;ref name="Passaglia161" /&gt; ''Music and Harvest'' and ''Aspiration and Literature'' were inspected 10 months after their restoration. Corrosion was seen developing at several cracks, seams, and small holes, and in some cases gypsum and water migrated out of pores in the bronze to the outside. The smaller corrosion spots were cleaned and relacquered. The larger ones were drilled out, soldered, replated, and relacquered.&lt;ref name="Ogburn176" /&gt; A second inspection occurred two years later. Only very small corrosion spots were discovered, and these were cleaned and relacquered.&lt;ref name="Ogburn176" /&gt; After 1974, the refinishing seemed to have worked well and corrosion of the exterior was minimal.&lt;ref name="Passaglia161" /&gt;

Although the statues were slightly darker than before and exhibited a slight sheen (due to the lacquer), members of the Commission of Fine Arts declared they were satisfied with the results.&lt;ref name="Ogburn177"&gt;Ogburn, et al., p. 177.&lt;/ref&gt;

===1984 and 2005 repairs===
In 1984, the Teltech company performed a restoration effort on ''The Arts of War'' and ''The Arts of Peace''. Local D.C. metallurgist and chemical engineer Joe Mazia assisted with the conservation.&lt;ref&gt;Holley, Joe. "Restorations Brought Metallurgist Unalloyed Joy." ''Washington Post.'' March 20, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;

Around 1985, the pedestal of the statue ''Valor'' was vandalized. The word "[[Dyke (slang)|dykes]]" (a derogatory term for [[lesbian]]) was spray-painted onto the granite. The National Park Service attempted to remove the paint with [[paint stripper]], which failed. It then tried [[arsenic]] in 2005, which not only failed to remove the paint but also left purple streaks on the granite. Art restorer [[Gordon Ponsford]] said he would use a [[laser]] to remove the paint. However, the laser did not remove the arsenic stain.&lt;ref&gt;Mansfield, Stephanie. "Monumental Task to Bring Back 'Valor'." ''Washington Times.'' July 22, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''The Monument to the Unknown Soldier''' ([[Arabic]]: '''نصب الجندي المجهول''') is a monument in central [[Baghdad]] built by Italian architect, Marcello D'Olivo, based on a concept by Iraqi sculptor, [[Khaled al-Rahal]], and constructed between 1979 and 1982. It was dedicated to the martyrs of the [[Iran–Iraq War]]. In 1986 the national square of Iraq, [[Great Celebrations square]], was built near the monument, and two other monuments were built close to the square in memory of the matyrs. In 1983, the [[Al-Shaheed Monument]] on the River, was opened and in 1989 the newly built [[Victory Arch]] became the entrances to the square. The ''Unknown Soldier's Monument'' represents a traditional shield (dira¹a) dropping from the dying grasp of an Iraqi warrior. The monument also houses an underground museum.

==Background==

The ''Monument to the Unknown Soldier'' was commissioned in 1979 and completed in 1982.&lt;ref&gt;Bloom, J. and Blair, S.S., ''Grove Encyclopedia of Islamic Art &amp; Architecture,'' Oxford University Press, 2009, p. 251&lt;/ref&gt; It was part of a broader Ba'athist government program to build a number of public works that would help instil a sense of national pride, and at the same time immortalise [[Saddam Hussein]]'s reputation as a powerful leader. Saddam turned to  his favourite artist, Khaled al-Rahal, who did more than any other Iraqi artist to incorporate ancient motifs in his work,&lt;ref&gt;Brown, B.A. and Feldman, M.H. (eds), ''Critical Approaches to Ancient Near Eastern Art,''Walter de Gruyter, 2014 p.xix&lt;/ref&gt; to devise the concept for the monument.&lt;ref&gt;Bloom, J. and Blair, S.S., ''Grove Encyclopedia of Islamic Art &amp; Architecture,'' Oxford University Press, 2009, p. 251; Baghdad Writers Group, ''Baghdad and Beyond,'' Middle East Editorial Associates, 1985, p. 43; Borden, I. and Hall, R., ''The City Cultures Reader,''Psychology Press, 2000, p. 104; Makiya, K. and Al-Khalilm S., ''The Monument: Art, Vulgarity, and Responsibility in Saddam Hussein's Iraq,'' IB Taurus, 2004, p. 28&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the construction of the ''Monument to the Unknown Soldier,''  another colossal structure, the ''[[Al-Shaheed Monument]]'' (1983) was opened in the same area, and Saddam commissioned a third monument, the ''[[Victory Arch]],'' another concept, also by the sculptor, Khaled Al-Rahal, to be built in the same vicinity (commenced in 1983 and completed in 1989 after the sculptor's death). The three monuments form a visual and psychological unit, and all represent the pain and suffering of the eight-year war.&lt;ref&gt;Makiya, K. and Al-Khalilm S., ''The Monument: Art, Vulgarity, and Responsibility in Saddam Hussein's Iraq,''  p. 29&lt;/ref&gt;

The original concept was the work of Iraqi sculptor, Khaled al-Rahal,&lt;ref&gt;Makiya, K. and Al-Khalilm S., ''The Monument: Art and Vulgarity in Saddam Hussein's Iraq,'' IB Taurus, 2004, p. x and p. 74; Rohde, A., ''State-Society Relations in Ba'thist Iraq: Facing Dictatorship,'' Routledge, 2010  p.120; King, E.A. and Levin, G., ''Ethics and the Visual Arts,'' Skyhorse Publishing, 2010, p. 105&lt;/ref&gt; with the architectural designs developed by the Italian architect, Marcello D'Olivo.&lt;ref&gt;"Marcello D'Olivo (1921 - 1991)," in ''Dizionario Bigrafico dei Friulani,'' [http://www.dizionariobiograficodeifriulani.it/dolivo-marcello/ Online:]&lt;/ref&gt;

The monument sits on top of an artificial hill, shaped like a low, truncated cone of 250&amp;nbsp;m diameter.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/world/iraq/unknown-soldier-dg.htm GlobalSecurity.org "Monument to the Unknown Soldier, Baghdad, Iraq"]&lt;/ref&gt; The monument itself consists of several elements grouped on the hilltop. The centrepiece is a cantilevered dome, 42&amp;nbsp;m in diameter, with an inclination of 12 degrees and made of reinforced concrete. The dome represents a ''dira'a'' (Iraqi shield) falling from the grasp of a dying warrior.&lt;ref&gt;Pieri, C., " Modernity and its Posts in constructing an Arab capital: Baghdad’s urban space and architecture, context and questions," ''Middle East Studies Association Bulletin,'' The Middle East Studies Association of North America, 2009, Vol. 42, No. 1-2, p.4; Simonowitz, D,., "Head Trips: An Intertextual Analysis of Later Architecture and Sculpture Under Saddam Hussein," ''International Journal of Islamic Architecture,'' Vol. 1, No. 1, 2012, pp. 61-81, DOI: https://doi.org/10.1386/ijia.1.1.61_1&lt;/ref&gt;

At the side of the dome, is a spiral tower, which is reminiscent of the minaret at [[Samarra]]. Its external surface is clad with copper, while its inner surface features a [[soffit]] finished with pyramidal modules alternating steel and copper. The promenade is covered by a semi-circular, flat roof supported on a triangular steel bracing. The roof is covered with a copper sheet and the soffit displays V-shaped panels of stainless steel and Murano glass.&lt;ref&gt;Bloom, J. and Blair, S.S., ''Grove Encyclopedia of Islamic Art &amp; Architecture,'' Oxford University Press, 2009, p. 251&lt;/ref&gt; It is surrounded by slanting girders of triangular section that are covered with marble. Red granite, stepped platforms of elliptical form lead to the dome and cubic sculpture. The steel flagpole is entirely covered with [[Murano glass]] panels fixed on stainless steel arms and displaying the national flag colours.

Beneath the shield is a cube, made of seven layers of metal, said to represent the seven levels of [[Heaven|Jannah]] in the Islamic faith.  Inside the layers of metal are sheets of red acrylic, said to represent the blood of the slain Iraqi soldiers.  The cube itself is connected to the underground museum by a long shaft with windows that allow light to shine in from above. Inside the museum, visitors can look up at the ceiling and see through the openings leading to the cube above.

The monument appeared on the [[Iraqi dinar]] bank-note in the 1990-2003 series (pictured).

The 1982 ''Monument to the Unknown Soldier'' was not the first of such monuments to be constructed in Baghdad. In 1959, an arched monument to the Unknown Soldier was erected in Baghdad's [[Firdos Square]]. It was designed by Iraqi architect, [[Rifat Chadirji]], and was a modern adaption of the [[Taq Kasra|arch of Ctesiphon]] in the ancient capital of the [[Parthian Empire]].&lt;ref&gt;Bernhardsson, M.T., "Visions of the Past: Modernizing the Past in 1950s Baghdad," in Sandy Isenstadt and Kishwar Rizvi, ''Modernism and the Middle East: Architecture and Politics in the Twentieth Century," University of Washington Press, 2008, p.92&lt;/ref&gt; 

Sketches of the design found at the Institute of Fine Arts in Baghdad, reveal the inspiration for the design which represents a mother bending over to pick up her martyred child.&lt;ref&gt;Younis, A., "Monuments (by) Architects (for) Governments," ''Di'van,'' December, 2016, pp 78-87; "Before Monument to the Unknown Soldier (1980-) there was the Unknown Soldier Monument (1961-1982)," ''Isqeena Magazine,'' 25 August, 2013, [http://isqineeha.tumblr.com/post/59363871467/before-monument-to-the-unknown-soldier Online:]&lt;/ref&gt; Described as a simple, symbolic, modernist structure, a comparison between the original and its later replacement illustrates the increasing level of abstraction and sophistication in Iraqi art during the period. 

The original was removed from al-Fardous Square to make way for a statue of Saddam Hussein in the early 1980s. The replacement statue was destroyed by the American forces after they captured Baghdad in 2003 while the world watched via television.&lt;ref&gt;King, E.A. and Levin, G., ''Ethics and the Visual Arts,'' Skyhorse Publishing, 2010, p. 105&lt;/ref&gt; 

Reports that Chadirji had been invited to rebuild the monument circulated for many years, but no progress has been evident, and the elderly Chadirji has since emigrated to England, where he lives with his wife.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.alarabiya.net/articles/2009/05/03/71903.html "Famed Iraqi architect rebuilds Baghdad landmark"] Al Arabiya News, November 2, 2010, retrieved September 20 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Ben hands off to Willie.jpg|thumb|250px|The [[Pittsburgh Steelers]] of the [[National Football League|NFL]] wearing their 75th year "Throwback" uniforms.]]

'''Throwback uniforms''', '''throwback jerseys''' or '''retro kits''' or '''heritage guernseys''' are [[sports uniform]]s styled to resemble the uniforms that a team wore [[Retro style|in the past]]. One-time or limited-time retro uniforms are sometimes produced to be worn by teams in games, on special occasions such as anniversaries of significant events.

Throwback uniforms have proven popular in all major pro and college sports in North America, not only with fans, but with the teams' merchandising departments. Because the "authentic" uniforms (accurate reproductions) and less-authentic "replicas" had been so popular at retail, the professional leagues institutionalized throwbacks as "[[third jersey]]s".

== Background ==
Throwbacks were first popularized in [[Major League Baseball]], where teams not only wore renditions of their past styles, but also tributes to defunct [[Minor League Baseball|minor league]] and [[Negro League]] baseball teams as well. Often, the games where teams will wear throwbacks are promoted as ''"Turn Back The Clock Nights"''. Throwbacks also make frequent appearances every season in [[college football]] games, [[National Hockey League]] games, and in [[National Basketball Association]] games.

The first companies to produce throwback uniforms were Tiedman &amp; Company Sportswear (college football, basketball, hockey, NFL and [[FIFA World Cup|World Cup]] soccer), Mitchell &amp; Ness (Major League Baseball), and Ebbets Field Flannels (Negro League baseball). All three companies are still in business; Tiedman &amp; Company relaunched in 2009 under the brand name Tiedman &amp; Formby [[Vintage (design)|Vintage]] Athletic Co..

In some instances, teams will wear "fauxbacks": retro designed uniforms harkening back to an era which pre-dates the team itself. For example, the [[Tampa Bay Rays]], formed in 1998, wore 1979-style baseball uniforms in 2012 (although they have used [[Tampa Tarpons]] and [[Tampa Smokers]] throwback jerseys),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.chriscreamer.com/logo.php?id=egltsw8ih6uwg1iw7536i8lxu|title=Tampa Bay Rays Wordmark Logo – American League (AL) – Chris Creamer's Sports Logos Page – SportsLogos.Net|work=chriscreamer.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Dallas Mavericks]] have used a 1970s-like basketball uniform since 2004, despite having been established in 1980.  Fauxback can also refer to a retro style "vintage inspired" uniform that has design elements from a uniform from the past but is in itself a completely new and different design due to cosmetic adjustments.  An example of this is the current [[Buffalo Bills]] NFL team uniforms that feature helmets resembling the team's white helmets from the 1970s but with a different, more modern looking stripe design.

=== National Football League ===
Throwbacks were introduced in the [[National Football League|NFL]] in 1991 at retail through the NFL Throwbacks Collection.{{Citation needed|date=October 2011}} The rights to produce the vintage apparel was limited to six apparel licensees, including Tiedman &amp; Company Sportswear (exclusive to jerseys), Riddell (helmets), Starter (caps), Nutmeg Mills (sweatshirts), and DeLong (jackets). In [[1994 NFL season|1994]], to honor the NFL's 75th Anniversary, teams were allowed to wear modern versions of their old uniform styles.

{{Commons category|Throwback American football uniforms}}

However, the designs varied widely in their accuracy:
* While no attempt was made to simulate obsolete [[leather]] helmets which were phased out in the 1950s, teams simulating uniforms from the era of leather headgear simply removed all decals and striping from their regular hard-shell helmets.
* A rule imposed by the [[AFL–NFL merger]] in [[1970 NFL season|1970]] adopted the AFL's policy of all jerseys displaying the player's last name on the back side. This practice was not part of the NFL officially until after the merger, but in order to keep consistency with current rules, the names were placed on the back side of all throwback jerseys.
* In most instances the fonts and typestyles used were only approximate matches at best.
* The [[Arizona Cardinals]], [[Chicago Bears]] and [[Pittsburgh Steelers]] wore reproductions of uniforms that pre-dated large numerals on the front of jerseys, so instead smaller numerals were worn on the right shoulder.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.webcitation.org/query?url=http://www.geocities.com/Colosseum/Stadium/3028/pitt-v-colts.jpg&amp;date=2009-10-25+07:19:46&lt;/ref&gt;
* The [[Dallas Cowboys]] and Buffalo Bills received some criticism for their portrayal of their throwbacks. The Cowboys wore their early 1960s uniforms with their current helmet, while the Bills wore their then-current uniforms with the old "standing buffalo" logo in white on their red helmets, in place of the current blue "charging buffalo" logo. Later that season, the Cowboys used the "double-star" uniform, which could be considered an updated version of the 1960s jerseys. Ironically, both teams have since adopted these throwbacks more accurately as alternates, with Dallas now using the original, plain star helmet and Buffalo using the original red "standing buffalo" helmet on white background, as well as wearing the [[American Football League|AFL]]-era jerseys as opposed to the [[Jim Kelly]]/[[Marv Levy]]-era jerseys (the two jerseys have few noticeable differences other than sleeve stripes, which were present on the 1960s jerseys but not on the 1990s ones). The Bills adopted 1975-era throwbacks, with white helmets, as their main uniform in 2011. The [[New York Jets]] also received similar criticism for using their throwback logo on their then-current green helmets; when they adopted the throwback design full-time in 1998, they also went back to their original-style white helmets. The Bills and Cowboys did the same when they adopted their retro unis.
* The [[Miami Dolphins]], [[New Orleans Saints]], [[Seattle Seahawks]], [[Tampa Bay Buccaneers]], [[Indianapolis Colts]] and [[Cleveland Browns]] had not had major uniform redesigns up to that point or only made subtle changes, as the Seahawks and Buccaneers had joined the league just 18 years earlier. The Seahawks and Buccaneers have also since redesigned their uniforms in 2002, 2012 and 1997, 2014 respectively, while the Dolphins made some minor updates in 1997, then a brand new look altogether in 2013, the Saints got new uniforms in 2000, and also the Browns in 2015.

[[File:Champ Bailey.JPG|thumb|[[Champ Bailey]] wearing a [[Denver Broncos]] throwback uniform in 2009]]
All the teams were informed that they would be wearing the Throwbacks during Week Three of the season. Some teams continued to wear theirs throughout the season. The [[San Francisco 49ers]] wore replicas of their 1955 uniforms in their [[Super Bowl XXIX]] victory. The uniforms were well-liked enough that the 49ers brought them back, in slightly modified form, for 1996–1997. In 1998, the gold pants from before were returned, in more modern form. In 2009, the team debuted an updated design of the 1980s uniforms that won them four of their five [[Super Bowls]].

Both of the NFL's New York City teams' throwbacks proved so popular with their fans that the teams returned to wearing them full-time soon afterwards: [[New York Jets|The Jets']] replicas of their 1968 uniforms (with a darker shade of green than before), and the [[New York Giants|Giants']] 1961 uniforms, with the lowercase "ny" instead of the underlined uppercase "GIANTS" – which was retained as a secondary logo – imposed after moving to East Rutherford, New Jersey. Both teams have modernized the 1960s decals for their current primary corporate logos.

As a result of the NFL modifying its rules to allow teams to wear alternate jerseys in 2002, throwbacks still make occasional appearances. The [[NFL on Thanksgiving Day|Thanksgiving Day games]] hosted by the [[Detroit Lions]] and [[Dallas Cowboys]] have been a showcase of throwbacks in recent years. The Bills, [[San Diego Chargers]] and Cowboys traditionally wear their early 1960s throwbacks twice each season.  Additionally, the Lions dropped their much criticized black alternates in favor of the popular 1940's and 1950s throwbacks (plain blue jersey, silver pants and helmets) in 2008. However;  due to the NFL's regulations about player safety and helmets both teams have ceased wearing the throwback uniforms. The Lions in 2011 and Cowboys in 2013.

The [[Cleveland Browns]] throwbacks are based on a uniform/helmet combination that first appeared in 1957 when [[Jim Brown]] was drafted. (Player numbers appeared on the side of the helmet that year.) The Browns began wearing their throwbacks in 2006 as part of the team's 60th Anniversary. They only wear them once per season.

The [[Tampa Bay Buccaneers]], who substantially changed their uniforms and team colors in 1997, never wore their orange throwbacks from 1997 to 2008. In [[2009 NFL season#Uniforms|2009]], the team wore their throwbacks for the first time against the [[Green Bay Packers|Packers]] on November 8 to debut the "Buccaneers' Ring of Honor." The club has continued to do so annually until 2014.

The [[San Diego Chargers]] wore their 1960s style powder-blue uniforms with white helmets as alternates from 2002 to 2006 and in 2007 adopted a modified version as their full-time uniforms. Meanwhile, the [[San Francisco 49ers]] wore their 1980s-style home red uniforms as throwbacks in 2002 (in 2005 the team re-designated them as alternate uniforms to be worn 1–2 home games a season). The team also petitioned the league to wear the throwbacks on the 2007 season opening night, as a tribute to their late former head coach [[Bill Walsh (American football coach)|Bill Walsh]]. For the 2009 season, an updated design based heavily on the 1980s throwbacks was debuted by the 49ers, which was combined with the team's current modern logo. On September 16, 2007, the [[Pittsburgh Steelers]], celebrating their 75th season, wore a variation of their older early '60s uniforms that featured gold helmets with black stripe, black jerseys with gold numbers and stripes, and white pants with black-and-gold side stripes as they hosted Buffalo. They wore them again on [[Monday Night Football]] on November 5 against [[Baltimore Ravens|Baltimore]]. The Steelers enjoyed immense success in both games, winning each handily (26–3 vs. Buffalo, 38–7 vs. Baltimore), in direct contrast to the team's struggles when they wore those jerseys originally. On November 11, 2007, The New York Giants, wore their red uniforms against the division rival Dallas Cowboys. Also in 2007, the [[New York Jets]] twice wore replicas of their New York Titans uniforms – once against the [[Philadelphia Eagles]], and once against the [[Miami Dolphins]].  Since then, the Jets have worn the Titans uniforms several more times – twice in 2008, three times in 2009, and once in 2011.  For two of the 2009 games, the Jets wore white versions, replicating the Titans road uniforms.

The Eagles wore their powder blue and yellow throwback jerseys during the home game against the [[Detroit Lions|Lions]] on September 23, 2007. Though the Eagles had a big 56–21 victory, these particular Throwbacks were criticised as being very unattractive. During [[NBC Sunday Night Football|Sunday Night Football]] on [[NBC]] that week, [[Keith Olbermann]] named the Philadelphia Eagles the "Worst Persons in the NFL" for their blue-and-yellow throwback jerseys, citing "Throwbacks? Try ''throw-ups!''" The blue and yellow uniforms, which are the same colors as the flag of the City of [[Philadelphia]], were used by the Eagles, and their predecessors, the defunct [[Frankford Yellowjackets]] franchise, until the 1940s when the more familiar pre-[[Jeffrey Lurie]] era [[kelly green]] was introduced. The kelly green throwbacks from the 1960 season were wore for the 2010 season opener vs. the [[Green Bay Packers]] to commemorate the 50th anniversary of when the Eagles beat the Packers to win the [[1960 NFL Championship]].

For the [[2009 NFL season|2009 season]], commemorating the 50th anniversary of the founding of the [[American Football League]], the eight charter members of the AFL wore throwback uniforms from the early 1960s on select "Legacy Weekends." The Dallas Cowboys, also celebrating their 50th anniversary season, wore throwback jerseys for some games.

The Packers, starting in 2010, introduced their 1929 throwback uniforms as their alternative uniform. Honoring the Packers first ever championship team in 1929, the uniform features a navy blue jersey with yellow numbers, with an added twist, as the uniforms in 1929 featured a small yellow circle in the front with a blue number in it. The circle and numbers were enlarged to meet current NFL uniform rules. Complimenting the rest of the uniform were tan pants, replicating the canvas uniform pants used during the 1920s. The team switched to their 1940s uniforms for the 2015 season, which removed the yellow circle but retained the color scheme.

The NFL imposed a new rule for the [[2013 NFL season|2013 season]] prohibiting the use of alternate colored helmets, eliminating many of the historically accurate throwback uniforms that had been in use up to that point. Teams are still allowed to use alternate decals (or no decals at all) for their throwbacks, but they must use them on the regular helmets.&lt;ref&gt;Breech, John (September 17, 2013).

'Retro shirts', as they are known in the United Kingdom, are also sometimes used in [[association football]], albeit with modern fabrics. In 2005–06 [[Arsenal F.C.|Arsenal]] changed their home colours from their traditional red and white to a variant of maroon known as redcurrant as a commemoration of their final season at [[Arsenal Stadium|Highbury Stadium]]; this colour was supposedly the same shade the team had worn when they first played at Highbury in 1913,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Kit Design| date=7 December 2007| publisher=[[Arsenal F.C.]]| url =http://www.arsenal.com/history/kit-design| accessdate = 17 October 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; although later evidence suggested that Arsenal's main colour at that time was a more standard shade known as 'Garibaldi red'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | first=Mark| last=Andrews| first2 =Andy|last2 =Kelly |title=Woolwich Arsenal in 1913 or is it? | date=February 8, 2013| work=The History of Arsenal |publisher=AISA Arsenal History Society | url =http://www.blog.woolwicharsenal.co.uk/archives/5358| accessdate = March 2, 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Redcurrant, however, still played a part in their kits since; most recently on their yellow change kit featuring redcurrant shorts and pinstripes on the shirt and socks, between 2010 and 2012.

[[Manchester United F.C.|Manchester United]] wore several retro-style kits in the 1990s and 2000s, based on kits the worn by the club in the 1950s and '60s, as well as that worn by their first ever team, known then as ''Newton Heath''.  The Newton Heath-inspired kit was introduced for their centenary in 1992 and worn for two seasons as a third kit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Manchester United Change Kits|url=http://historicalkits.co.uk/Manchester_United/Manchester_United-change-kits.html|work=historicalkits.co.uk|first=Dave|last=Moor|accessdate=12 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; They wore a replica of their jersey from 1958 during the [[Manchester derby]] against [[Manchester City F.C.|Manchester City]] on February 10, 2008 at [[Old Trafford]] to mark the 50th anniversary of the [[Munich air disaster]] four days earlier. United were granted special dispensation by the [[Premier League]] to wear the one-off uniform which was devoid of logos and kit markings, and used the traditional "one to eleven" numbering scheme rather than using [[squad number (association football)|squad numbers]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | first=Oliver| last=Kay| title=Manchester United replicate 1958 kit to mark game of respect for Busby Babes| date=2007-12-07| publisher=The Times| url =http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/sport/football/premier_league/manchester_united/article3013603.ece| work = | pages = | accessdate = 2008-10-17 | language = }}&lt;/ref&gt; In a gesture of solidarity, Manchester City similarly removed the sponsor and manufacturer logos from their kits for the game, giving their shirts the same clean and empty look resembling the plain shirts of the 1950s when logos and team badges were not worn. However, they used the current season's kit style and chose not to go the whole distance in producing a retro-looking kit; retaining the club crest, competition sleeve patches, and the player name and squad number on the kit but added a [[black ribbon]] above the right breast.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title=City unveil shirts without sponsors for derby clash to mark Munich anniversary | date=2008-02-05 | work=[[Daily Mail]] | url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/football/article-512438/City-unveil-shirts-sponsors-derby-clash-mark-Munich-anniversary.html | accessdate= 2013-09-18 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The previous season, [[2006–07 Manchester United F.C. season|2006–07]], United introduced a similar 1950s-style uniform to celebrate 50 years of the [[Busby Babes]]' first [[1955–56 Football League|league championship]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title=New home kit to be revealed on ManUtd.com | date=2006-07-07 | publisher=[[Manchester United F.C.]] | url=http://www.manutd.com/en/News-And-Features/Club-News/2006/Jul/New-home-kit-to-be-revealed-on-ManUtdcom.aspx | accessdate= 2013-09-20 }}&lt;/ref&gt; After their [[2008 UEFA Champions League Final|Champions League victory]] in 2008, United introduced another retro-style kit for [[2008–09 Manchester United F.C. season|2008–09]], celebrating the 40th anniversary of their first European Cup win.  The club unveiled an all-blue third kit, based on the one worn against [[S.L.

More authentic reproductions of kits from the past have become popular fashion items, especially jerseys linked to successful or memorable teams. When [[France national football team|France]] won the [[1998 FIFA World Cup|1998 World Cup]], their uniform was reminiscent of the design of the triumphant [[UEFA Euro 1984|Euro 1984]] team, with a red horizontal stripe and three thin horizontal stripes across the chest.

When the [[United States men's soccer team]] took the field between 1999 and 2001, their plain white uniform with a thick V-neck collar looked reminiscent of the [[United States Soccer Federation|U.S. Soccer Federation]]'s first uniform worn in 1916. A similar uniform was produced in 2013, complete with vintage crest, to mark the 100th anniversary of the USSF.

For the FIFA Centenary Match in 2004, [[France national football team|France]] and [[Brazil national football team|Brazil]] played in kits resembling their first ever home kits.  The Brazilian team wore white tops with blue trim, the original colours of their home kit, which was replaced in 1951 by today's yellow top with green trim after the [[Uruguay v Brazil (1950 FIFA World Cup)|1950 World Cup defeat]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title=Fifa centenary match France host Brazil  | date=2004-05-21 | work=[[The Guardian]] | url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2004/may/21/newsstory.sport14 | first=Keir | last=Radnedge | accessdate= 2015-04-12 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Tottenham Hotspur F.C.|Tottenham Hotspur]] celebrated their 125th anniversary during the [[2007–08 Tottenham Hotspur F.C. season|2007–08 season]] by launching a special kit in the club's early colours, sky blue and white, which were originally worn in 1885.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title=125th ANNIVERSARY INSPIRES NEW PUMA SPURS KITS | date=17 May 2007 | work=[[Tottenham Hotspur F.C.]] | url=http://www.tottenhamhotspur.com/news/125th-anniversary-inspires-new-puma-spurs-kits-170507/ | accessdate= 7 March 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The kit was worn for one game only, a 4–4 home draw to [[Aston Villa F.C.|Aston Villa]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title=Spurs Special Edition 125 Anniversary Kit | date=2 October 2007 | work=Football Shirt Culture | url=http://www.footballshirtculture.com/07/08-Kits/spurs-special-edition-125-anniversary-kit.html | accessdate= 7 March 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

For the [[2009–10 Premier League]], newly promoted [[Burnley F.C.|Burnley]] wore a redesigned version of their [[1959–60 Football League]] kits, when they last won the [[Football League First Division|then-First Division]].

[[Southampton F.C.|Southampton]] celebrated the club's 125th anniversary in [[2010–11 Southampton F.C. season|2010–11]], by wearing the strip worn by the team's original forebears, which consisted of a white shirt with a red sash, white shorts and black socks.

During the later stages of the 2011–12 season, financially troubled Scottish club [[Rangers F.C.|Rangers]] wore their normal blue shirts on the pitch, but began selling and encouraging fans to wear throwback red and black striped scarves, the traditional colours of the burgh of Govan (where [[Ibrox Stadium]] is located) in an attempt to raise money.  The club would be placed in administration, face liquidation and then sold to a new ownership group, with a severe relegation penalty for the 2012–13 season.

English club [[West Bromwich Albion F.C.|West Bromwich Albion]] wore a replica of their [[1968 FA Cup Final]] kit, in their Premier League game against [[Leicester City F.C.|Leicester City]] on 11 April 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title= Jeff Astle charity launched on special West Bromwich Albion day | date= 2015-04-11 | publisher= [[BBC]] | url= https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-32257003 | accessdate= 2015-04-12 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  It was worn to honour the match-winning goalscorer in the 1968 Cup Final, [[Jeff Astle]], who died in 2002 due to [[chronic traumatic encephalopathy]] as a result of heading the heavy leather footballs through his career.  The kit used the 1–11 numbering system save for the goalkeeper's shirt, which was left blank as they were in those days.

2014–15 [[Scottish Championship]] winners [[Heart of Midlothian F.C.]] chose for their current season a replica of the shirt worn by the team 100 years ago, for the 1914–15 season. The shirt is plain maroon with a white collar and fly-button opening and has no sponsorship logos. Though the 1914–15 shirt bore no badge, the current shirt has an embroidered badge in the style of the club's logo of one hundred years ago. The shirt and badge also commemorate Hearts first and reserve teams, management and fans who, though currently topping the Scottish league, volunteered for the [[Great War]] effort en-masse in November 1914 to join a newly forming wartime volunteer infantry battalion, 16th Battalion [[Royal Scots]], commanded by [[George McCrae (politician)]] MP. Spurred on by Hearts, "[[McCrae's Battalion]]" also attracted players and supporters from other Scottish teams plus various sportsmen. The first football team to join up, Hearts and "McCrae's Battalion" were mentioned in thanks by Winston Churchill in Parliament and proved a catalyst in the formation of other football and sportsmen battalions of [[Kitchener's Army]]. Heart of Midlothian lost 7 players killed in the war, plus others maimed or gassed and unable to resume their careers after the war.

[[File:Port Adelaide Magpies Jumper.svg|thumb|110px|right|{{AFL Por}}'s heritage guernsey.]]
{{See also|Guernsey (Australian rules football)}}
Throwback uniforms, more commonly called '''heritage guernseys''', are worn occasionally by clubs in the [[Australian Football League]], mostly to commemorate the anniversaries of past successes or events. Between 2003 and 2007, there was an annual "Heritage Round", in which all clubs were encouraged to wear heritage guernseys from either their club or state.

The heritage guernsey of the [[Port Adelaide Football Club]] has been a regular source of controversy. The primary historical guernsey of the Port Adelaide Football Club, when it dominated national football the years before World War I and the [[South Australian National Football League]] for the 19th century, was black with a white "prison bars" design; however, when the club entered the Australia Football League in 1997, it was forced to change its colours to avoid a clash with the [[Collingwood Football Club]], who also wear black and white although in a different design. Whether or not Port Adelaide is permitted to wear its black and white guernsey in any heritage matches, even those not played against Collingwood, has been a point of contention between the clubs.

{{cquote|"It should have nothing to do with Eddie McGuire and Collingwood...I'll say that for a start."|15px|15px| [[Leigh Matthews]] during a discussion regarding Port Adelaide's traditional guernsey &lt;br /&gt;during the 2014 Elimination Final.&lt;ref&gt;Leigh Matthews, 2014 AFL Elimination Final – Port Adelaide vs. Richmond, Channel 7.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The most recent instance of the club wearing the guernsey was during the Elimination Final of the [[2014 AFL season]].

In 1990, the [[Chicago White Sox]] wore replicas of their [[1917 World Series]] uniforms against the [[Milwaukee Brewers]] as part of the White Sox celebration of the final season at [[Comiskey Park]]. During the game, the scoreboard and public address system were turned off, and the lineups announced with a hand-held megaphone.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | first=George| last=Bova| title=Memories of Old Comiskey Park: Turn Back the Clock Day July 11, 1990| publisher=White Sox Interactive | url =http://www.whitesoxinteractive.com/OldComiskey/TurnBackTheClock.html| work = | pages = | accessdate = 2008-10-17 | language = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Since then, these games have proven popular not only among team fans but also with viewers of TV highlight shows. [[ESPN]], for the highlights of the 1990 game, sped up the highlights and showed them in black and white to emulate the [[silent film]] of the era. The team then adopted a modified version of the 1959 "Go-Go Sox" era jerseys for the first year at [[Guaranteed Rate Field|the new Comiskey Park]] in 1991, having kept that design since and winning the [[2005 World Series]] in that design, ending an 88-year World Series championship drought.

With the introduction of [[interleague play]], when the [[Atlanta Braves]] played the [[Boston Red Sox]] for the first time in a regular season game in Boston in 1997, the teams wore uniforms that traced back to the initial season in which each team adopted the current nickname, the Braves wearing road uniforms from the 1912 season with the word 'BOSTON' and the Red Sox wearing 1908 uniforms with a large red sock with the word 'BOSTON' in white on the sock. It was the Braves' first official game against the Red Sox since the team moved to Milwaukee after the 1952 season. Braves manager Bobby Cox went on record as being firmly against his team being identified as 'Boston' by their uniforms.

Some throwback nights featured the [[Oakland Athletics]] wearing one combo or another of the gold/white/green uniform set it featured in the 1970s and 1980s, or the [[Pittsburgh Pirates]]' black-and-gold combo from the same era – on June 26, 2010, they did so against one another, with Pittsburgh in black and Oakland in gold.

In 2003 the [[St. Louis Cardinals]] hosted the [[Baltimore Orioles]] with teams wearing retro St. Louis Cardinals and [[History of the St. Louis Browns|St. Louis Browns]] (the predecessor to today's Orioles, which moved to Baltimore for 1954) uniforms, respectively. The scoreboard that day said "Browns" and the stadium announcer played along with the fantasy as well.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | first=Matthew| last=Leach|author2=Gary Washburn  | title=Orioles turn back Cards| date=2003-06-07| publisher=[[MLB.com]]| url =http://www.mlb.com/news/wrap.jsp?ymd=20030607&amp;content_id=361373&amp;vkey=wrapup2003&amp;fext=.jsp&amp;c_id=null| work = | pages = | accessdate = 2008-10-17 | language = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Also in 2003, in commemoration of the 100th anniversary of the [[1903 World Series|first modern World Series]], the two participants in that game (the [[Boston Red Sox]] and the [[Pittsburgh Pirates]]) met in a 3-game interleague series at [[PNC Park]] in [[Pittsburgh]]. While the Red Sox took two of three of those games with both teams wearing their standard uniforms, the one the Pirates won was meant to replicate their matchup in the 1903 World Series with both teams wearing 1903-era throwbacks. Although baseball teams did not have [[Squad number|uniform numbers]] at the time, to keep with the current rules numbers were put on the backs of the otherwise-accurate throwbacks. The [[JumboTron]] screen was left with a static background, and the scoreboard had the different team names at the time: the "Boston Americans" and the "[[Etymology of Pittsburgh|Pittsburg]] Pirates". The stadium crew at PNC Park also did other 1903-era activities such as using a [[megaphone]] for announcements.

In 2006 the [[New York Mets]], in honor of the 20th anniversary of the 1986 World Series, held a "turn-back-the-clock-night" and wore their 1986 uniforms.  In 2009 the Mets played three games of a four-game set against the [[San Francisco Giants]] in a "fauxback" jersey based on early 20th century New York Giants' jerseys with a giant "NY" on the chest, but using the Mets' current team colors of orange and blue. (The Mets are the only team to have worn a throwback from their home city's past instead of their franchise's past; while the [[Minnesota Twins]] and [[Texas Rangers (baseball)|Texas Rangers]], both of whom were once the Washington Senators, have each used throwbacks from their previous hometown, the city's current team, the [[Washington Nationals]], have worn both Twins-Senators and Rangers-Senators throwbacks as well.) In 2008, the [[Philadelphia Phillies]] adopted an alternate uniform based on their [[1948 Philadelphia Phillies season|1948]] uniforms, but with modern graphics on an off-white color background.

[[File:Aaron Miles (Dodgers throwback uniform).jpg|thumb|[[Aaron Miles]] in a throwback [[Los Angeles Dodgers]] uniform]]
Not all throwbacks use Major League uniforms; at least 15 MLB teams have at some point paid tribute to the pre-integration [[Negro league baseball|Negro Leagues]] by wearing the uniform of a Negro League from the city's past; in almost every case both teams do so simultaneously. Since the [[Homestead Grays]] played "home" games in both Washington and Pittsburgh, the team has been honored as such by both the Nationals and Pirates; in 2008 the two teams did so together, with Washington wearing the Grays' home uniforms and Pittsburgh the away ones.

The [[Tampa Bay Rays]] have staged a "Turn Back the Clock" promotion with a retro theme and throwback uniforms almost every season of their existence. Because the franchise does not yet have a long history from which to choose uniforms, they have often worn the uniforms of historical local teams such as the [[Tampa Tarpons]] of the [[Florida State League]] (worn in 1999, 2006, and 2010), the [[St. Petersburg Pelicans]] of the [[Senior Professional Baseball Association]] (worn in 2008), the [[St. Petersburg Saints]] (2007) and [[Tampa Smokers]] (2011) of the [[Florida International League]], and the [[Tampa Spartans|University of Tampa Spartans]] (2000). The Rays have worn their own uniforms for Turn Back the Clock night only once: in 2009, when they wore Devil Rays "rainbow" uniforms from their 1998 inaugural season.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tampabay.com/news/humaninterest/article1180400.ece "Rays have worn a variety of throwback uniforms"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121016204058/http://www.tampabay.com/news/humaninterest/article1180400.ece |date=2012-10-16 }} ''St. Pete Times''&lt;/ref&gt; Usually, the Rays' opponent on Turn Back the Clock night wear throwbacks of their own from the same era as the Rays' retro uniforms. For example, the Houston Astros wore their 1980s "[[Rainbow Guts]]" uniforms, the Dodgers wore the 1955 road uniforms of the [[History of the Brooklyn Dodgers|Brooklyn Dodgers]], the Mets wore the road unis of their 1969 championship team, and the Orioles wore their rare all-orange uniforms from the early 1970s.

The [[San Diego Padres]] have also worn multiple throwback uniforms. Pre-1969 designs have represented the Padres of the [[Pacific Coast League]]. During the 2010 season, throwback uniforms were worn during all Thursday home day games. Multiple designs and color schemes were used, including the 1969 "first major league season" brown and gold, 1984 "first World Series" white with gold lettering and brown trim (and "RAK" on the sleeves for then-recently deceased owner Ray A. Kroc), and a 1990s era white with orange-trimmed blue lettering (while these were the accurate Padres jersey of the period, the design is also very similar to that of the [[New York Mets]], as the owners of the team at the time were investors from New York). All of these were fairly accurate representations of the team's uniforms and colors of the period, and in most games the visiting team wore throwback uniforms of a similar period. For example, at the final home game on September 30, the visiting [[Chicago Cubs]] and the Padres both wore 1984-era jerseys, in tribute to the 1984 NLCS, in which the same two teams played against each other.

In recent years, the Milwaukee Brewers have resurrected their old 1980s pinstriped uniforms with the old ball-in-glove "MB" logo on the caps for use as an alternate uniform.

In 2008, the [[Toronto Blue Jays]] unveiled their new "Flashback Friday" powder blue throwback uniforms, similar to those worn between the 1977 and 1979 seasons.

The [[Cleveland Indians]] throwbacks are usually worn once a year in July and normally are based on their uniforms from the mid-1970s to the early 1980s (most notably, their 1974 "All Red" home uniforms), They have also worn uniforms based on the 1948 Indians in honor of [[Larry Doby]], the first [[African Americans|African-American]] player in the [[American League]] with the Indians.

The 2011 [[Arizona Diamondbacks]] celebrated the tenth anniversary of their [[2001 World Series]] championship on September 9–11. To commemorate the event the Diamondbacks held a reunion of players who had been on the championship team. They also wore the purple, teal, and copper uniforms that the team wore from 1998 to 2006.

To celebrate the 100th anniversary of [[Fenway Park]], the [[New York Yankees]] and Boston Red Sox wore 1912 throwbacks during a regular-season game on April 20, 2012; the Yankees' 1912 uniforms were a nod to their days as the New York Highlanders.

In the [[1999 Major League Baseball season|1999 season]], MLB held a series of "[[Turn Ahead the Clock]]" nights. It was inspired by an independently held promotion on July 18, 1998 at a game between the [[Seattle Mariners]] and the [[Kansas City Royals]]. During those nights, teams wore uniforms envisioned as they might be in the year 2021. Twenty-two teams ultimately participated over 13 different games in 1999, with some teams wearing the uniforms more than once. The promotion proved unpopular, and has yet to be repeated since.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.baseball-reference.com/bullpen/Turn_Ahead_the_Clock_Night|title=Turn Ahead the Clock Night – BR Bullpen|work=baseball-reference.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2016, to celebrate the 30th anniversary of their [[1986 New York Mets season|1986 world championship season]], the [[New York Mets]] revived their 1986 uniforms to be used for all Sunday home games.

In [[1921 in baseball|1921]] a baseball game held at [[Rickwood Field]] as part of the Semicentennial of [[Birmingham, Alabama]] was played in "old-style" uniforms and according to "the rules of the games as they were in 1872.".&lt;ref name="Birmingham 1921"&gt;"Baseball Fans Given Rare Treat at Wood." (October 26, 1921) ''The Birmingham News''&lt;/ref&gt; Since 1996 Rickwood Field has been the site of the annual "Rickwood Classic", a regular season [[Birmingham Barons]] game in which both [[Southern League (baseball)|Southern League]] teams wear uniforms honoring some period of their respective histories.

The [[Lotte Giants]] of the Korea Baseball Organization has "Again 1984/1992" day once per month in commemoration of their league titles from those respective years. The team dresses in their old baby blue jerseys as well as their old cap, complete with the old logo. The "Again 1984/1992" games are usually the most popular games of the year in Busan, with the stadium as well as the throwback merchandising usually selling out fast. Due to this success, starting in 2008, other teams in the league such as [[Doosan Bears]] and [[Samsung Lions]] have started to incorporate a similar style of throwback day as well.

The [[Buffalo Bisons]] of the International League adopted a throwback uniform as their main jersey in 2012 as part of their change in parent club affiliation to the [[Toronto Blue Jays]].

== Basketball ==

=== National Basketball Association ===
In the [[1996–97 NBA season]], the NBA celebrated its 50th anniversary by introducing throwback jerseys, known as "Hardwood Classics". The [[Toronto Raptors]] were notable for wearing the uniforms of the long-defunct [[Toronto Huskies]], an original BAA team. The Raptors have since brought back this tradition on certain occasions, notably games against the [[New York Knicks]]. The [[Chicago Bulls]] wore script-logo throwbacks from the beginning of [[Michael Jordan]]'s career. Some of the throwbacks that were introduced in this season have been brought back on more occasions since, notably the [[Golden State Warriors]], whose throwback placed the players' numbers inside an angled [[cable car (railway)|cable car]] (a reference to San Francisco, where they had played in the early years in California).

In more recent years, throwback jerseys in the NBA have recalled some of the more gaudy uniforms of the NBA and the [[American Basketball Association (1967–76)|ABA]], ranging from the aforementioned Warriors uniforms, to the [[Detroit Pistons]]' [[Thunderbolt|lightning bolt]] uniforms of the [[Dick Vitale]] era of the late 1970s, to the [[Miami Floridians]] throwbacks worn by the [[Miami Heat|Heat]], and the [[Cleveland Cavaliers]]' 1980s era jerseys worn by [[Brad Daugherty (basketball)|Brad Daugherty]], [[Mark Price]], and [[Ron Harper]] as well as uniforms based on the early and mid-1970s. In contrast, the [[New York Knicks]] often wear throwback uniforms from the 1970s and 1980s that are understated by comparison. The warmups and uniform shorts of that era feature an "interlocking NY" identical to the one worn by the [[New York Yankees]] on their caps and home jerseys. Most "Hardwood Classics" jerseys worn by current players for games, however, are based on modern fabrics, and not the classic fabric designs of the past. The [[Los Angeles Lakers]] wore throwback short-shorts in 2007 for one game. Kobe Bryant complained, saying, "I feel violated. I feel naked. It's one thing to see those old guys wearing them on film, it's another to actually wear them". The [[Philadelphia 76ers]] began wearing throwback jerseys from their championship season of 1982–83 in 2007–08 to honor the 25th anniversary of their championship. They were so popular that the Sixers kept these jerseys for next year, and reverted to their old logo (modified with a newer "6") for the [[2009–10 NBA season|2009–10 season]].

The [[Orlando Magic]] are notable for wearing the same throwback design at least twice; their black pinstriped throwback was used in 2003–04, 2006–07 and 2009–10 seasons. They also wore the blue pinstriped throwbacks in 2004–05 and the white pinstriped throwbacks in 2005–06. The then-[[New Orleans Pelicans|New Orleans Hornets]], [[Charlotte Hornets|Charlotte Bobcats]], [[Los Angeles Clippers]], [[Minnesota Timberwolves]] and [[Memphis Grizzlies]] were also notable for wearing throwbacks of long-forgotten [[American Basketball Association]] franchises [[New Orleans Buccaneers]], [[Carolina Cougars]], [[Los Angeles Stars]], [[Minnesota Muskies]] and [[Memphis Sounds|Memphis Tams/Pros]]. The [[San Antonio Spurs]] also paid tribute to their predecessors [[Dallas Chaparrals]], while the Bulls and the [[Washington Wizards]] did the same to a pair of former Chicago-based NBA franchises, the [[Chicago Stags|Stags]] and Zephyrs.

The usage of throwback uniforms even inspired some NBA teams to acquire elements used from old uniform designs in creating new ones. For example, the [[Detroit Pistons]], [[Milwaukee Bucks]], [[Cleveland Cavaliers]] and [[Golden State Warriors]] reverted to their original color schemes while adding some accent colors to create a more modern look, while the Magic and the [[Charlotte Bobcats]] revived the use of pinstripes on their uniforms. The [[Dallas Mavericks]] briefly used a third jersey with the green, blue and white color scheme of the 1980s. The [[Houston Rockets]] revived the classic red and gold scheme in unveiling their new alternate uniform in 2009. The [[Utah Jazz]] are re-using their classic "J" note logo and a similar (though not the same) color scheme, and also plan to adopt a similar uniform design to what they originally wore from 1974 to 1996. The [[Washington Wizards]] also went retro, with secondary logos inspired from the old Bullets logos and the modernized "[[Flag of the United States|Stars and Stripes]]" uniform worn from 1974 through 1987. The [[New York Knicks]] eliminated black from their color scheme and unveiled a modern adaptation of their 1970–75 uniforms, sans the shorts' side stripes, addition of silver trim, and a bolder, less arched "NEW YORK" script. The [[Sacramento Kings]] have used their classic Kansas City-era script to their gold and then black alternate uniforms. The [[Denver Nuggets]] revived the 'rainbow' uniforms from the 1980s as an alternate uniform, this time with the current colors and typeface, while the [[Oklahoma City Thunder]] wore alternate uniforms with a vertically arranged front script similar to those worn by the [[Oscar Robertson]]-era Cincinnati Royals. The [[Phoenix Suns]] paid tribute to the 1990s by unveiling new uniforms featuring a modified streaking sun.

In 2003, the [[Kansas State Wildcats men's basketball]] team wore throwback jerseys in home games against [[Kansas Jayhawks|Kansas]] and [[Missouri Tigers|Missouri]] to celebrate the program's 100th anniversary season. The jerseys were lavender with black letters and numerals, similar to the uniforms worn by [[Jack Hartman]]'s teams in the 1970s and 1980s, during some of KSU's best seasons.

The [[Kansas Jayhawks]] basketball team wore throwbacks in March 2005 to commemorate the 50th anniversary of [[Allen Fieldhouse]]. In February 2008 and February 2013, they wore throwbacks for the 20th and 25th anniversaries, respectively, of the [[1987–88 Kansas Jayhawks men's basketball team|1988 NCAA championship team]], and did so again in February 2012 to honor the [[1951–52 Kansas Jayhawks men's basketball team|1952 NCAA championship team]]'s 60th anniversary.

The [[Philadelphia Wings (1987–2014)|Philadelphia Wings]] indoor lacrosse team ditched their silver, red, and black uniforms for a game to wear their original [[Philadelphia Wings (1974–75)|orange and white jerseys worn in the early 1970s]] from the original [[National Lacrosse League (1974–75)|National Lacrosse League]]. For the 100th anniversary of [[Johns Hopkins – Maryland rivalry|the rivalry]] between [[Johns Hopkins Blue Jays men's lacrosse|Johns Hopkins]] and [[Maryland Terrapins men's lacrosse|Maryland]] in [[field lacrosse|men's lacrosse]], both teams wore special retro jerseys.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.diamondbackonline.com/home/index.cfm?event=displayArticlePrinterFriendly&amp;uStory_id=0a3ea5b0-8743-4f5c-842d-a7798060ccd0 Rivalry 101: Terps vs. Johns Hopkins], ''[[The Diamondback]]'', April 15, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; During the 35th anniversary of women's field hockey at [[Dartmouth College]], the [[Dartmouth Big Green|Big Green]] are wearing a special harlequin-design throwback uniform.

== Canadian football ==

=== Canadian Football League ===
The first documented use of a throwback uniform came during the [[1998 Calgary Stampeders season|1998 season]], when the [[Calgary Stampeders]] wore [[1948 Calgary Stampeders season|1948]] red striped jerseys to celebrate the [[36th Grey Cup|first]] [[Grey Cup]] championship won by the Stampeders franchise. The jerseys were worn on October 4, 1998 against the [[BC Lions]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.calgaryherald.com/sports/former%20stamps%20owner%20gutsche%20dies/8915635/story.html|title=Former Stamps owner Sig Gutsche dies at 64|first=,Bryan|last=Weismiller|work=calgaryherald.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; The BC Lions were the next to wear throwback jerseys in [[2003 BC Lions season|2003]], as they were celebrating their 50th season with orange replica jerseys from the [[1954 BC Lions season]]. Those jerseys were worn four times that season with the first being the home opener that year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4wnESgJUudk|title=CFL 2003 WINNIPEG BLUEBOMBERS AT BC-LIONS|first=|last=cflvideo1964|date=5 July 2013|publisher=|via=YouTube}}&lt;/ref&gt; In both cases, neither uniform was accurate as the jerseys were paired with pants and helmets from both teams' present day sets. In [[2007 Saskatchewan Roughriders season|2007]], the [[Saskatchewan Roughriders]] wore green replica jerseys from the late 1960s to 1970s with double white striping over the shoulders. As opposed to the single season usage the Stampeders and Lions employed, the Roughriders wore these jerseys from 2007 to [[2013 Saskatchewan Roughriders season|2013]], including their usage in the [[97th Grey Cup|97th]] and [[98th Grey Cup]].

It wasn't until the [[2008 CFL season]] that the league started to truly embrace throwback uniforms when they announced that the [[Winnipeg Blue Bombers]] and [[Toronto Argonauts]] would play two games (September 12 in [[Toronto]] and October 10 in [[Winnipeg]]) to celebrate and recognize the 1950s and in particular, the [[38th Grey Cup|1950 Mud Bowl Grey Cup game]].&lt;ref name="CFL 1950s"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cfl.ca/2008/08/26/celebrating-our-legacy-the-cfl-goes-retro/|title=Celebrating Our Legacy: The CFL goes "Retro"|date=26 August 2008|work=cfl.ca}}&lt;/ref&gt; Both teams wore coloured jerseys, as was common during the 1950s. Toronto's jerseys were a light blue in colour, with dark blue striping on the sleeves and the team's old "Pull Together" football-as-a-ship logo on the shoulders. The Blue Bombers' jerseys were dark blue in colour, with gold sleeve stripes. The team's 1950s-era logo was on the front of the jersey, just below the V in the neck. A special CFL "Retro Week" logo adorned each jersey as well, that logo being a take-off of the maple leaf one used as the league symbol from 1954 through 1969.

For the [[2009 CFL season]], all eight teams [[2009 CFL season#CFL retro|wore retro uniforms]], this time based on uniforms from the 1960s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cfl.ca/2009/04/07/cfl-retro-celebrating-the-sixties/|title=CFL Retro: Celebrating the Sixties|date=7 April 2009|work=cfl.ca}}&lt;/ref&gt; Week 3 of the 2009 season featured all teams wearing their retro uniforms. When revealed at the time, four teams had white retro jerseys and four had coloured retro jerseys. As the season progressed, Saskatchewan added a green 1960s jersey for the [[Labour Day Classic]] and Calgary wore a white 1960s jersey for the Labour Day rematch versus [[Edmonton Eskimos|Edmonton]]. 11 games were scheduled during the season to feature both teams wearing these uniforms while more were added later on.

In [[2010 CFL season|2010]], all eight teams again [[2010 CFL season#CFL retro|wore retro uniforms]] and for this season it was based on uniforms worn from the 1970s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cfl.ca/2010/01/30/kicking-off-2010-schedule-with-momentum/|title=Kicking off 2010 schedule with momentum|date=30 January 2010|work=cfl.ca}}&lt;/ref&gt; Teams wore retro uniforms during weeks 6 and 7, however, contrary to the previous year, only the [[Saskatchewan Roughriders]] wore white throwback uniforms, meaning most teams wore their regular white uniforms as the away team.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cfl.ca/2010/07/14/riders-set-to-celebrate-retro-style/|title=Riders set to celebrate retro style|date=14 July 2010|work=cfl.ca}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Roughriders wore their regular 1970s throwback jersey during retro games they hosted. Additionally, during this season, the Roughriders were celebrating their 100th anniversary as a franchise and wore black, red, and silver throwback uniforms similar to the ones worn by the Regina Roughriders from 1912 to 1947. These uniforms were worn on July 17, 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.riderville.com/2010/06/15/riders-unveil-retro-jerseys/|title=Riders unveil Retro Jerseys|date=15 June 2010|work=riderville.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While the league had originally planned to celebrate with retro uniforms each season leading up to the [[100th Grey Cup]], the CFL did not introduce 1980s-themed uniforms for the [[2011 CFL season]].&lt;ref name="CFL 1950s" /&gt; Some teams (Calgary, Saskatchewan, Toronto, and Winnipeg) continued wearing the previous year's retro uniforms while the rest wore no throwback uniforms at all. In [[2012 CFL season|2012]], all teams remodeled their full uniform set with only Saskatchewan and Winnipeg carrying over their 1970s throwback uniforms.

In [[2013 CFL season|2013]], the Toronto Argonauts wore 1980s throwback uniforms on August 23, 2013 to celebrate the 30th anniversary of the [[71st Grey Cup]] championship.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rogerscentre.com/events/article.jsp?content=20130822_143039_5108|title=Rogers Centre – Events – ARGONAUTS HOST STAMPEDERS IN 100TH GREY CUP REMATCH THIS FRIDAY NIGHT|work=rogerscentre.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also that year, the [[Hamilton Tiger-Cats]] wore red, black, and white replicas of the 1943 [[Hamilton Flying Wildcats]] to celebrate the 70th anniversary of their [[31st Grey Cup]] victory.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thespec.com/sports-story/4059672-ticats-to-pay-homage-to-flying-wildcats-with-historic-uniforms/|title=Ticats to pay homage to Flying Wildcats with historic uniforms|date=3 September 2013|publisher=|via=The Hamilton Spectator}}&lt;/ref&gt; In both cases, the uniforms from these games were worn only once. The Winnipeg Blue Bombers wore 1980s-themed uniforms from 2013 to 2015 before switching full-time to similar royal blue jerseys in 2016. The Roughriders introduced new throwback uniforms based on the uniforms from the early 1980s in 2014 and wore them again in 2015. The franchise introduced another green retro-styled jersey in 2016, but due to lack of numbers on the shoulders, were never actually worn before in their history.

As of the [[2015 CFL season]], the Saskatchewan Roughriders, Winnipeg Blue Bombers, and Toronto Argonauts have worn throwback uniforms representing four different decades, which is the most in the league. The Roughriders have worn six different throwback jerseys, including two white jerseys, which is also the most in the league. No Ottawa franchise ([[Ottawa Rough Riders]], [[Ottawa Renegades]], and [[Ottawa Redblacks]]) has ever worn a throwback uniform, presumably due to their checkered absences from the league over the past 20 years.

== Cricket ==
In February 2005 at [[Eden Park|Eden Park, Auckland]], [[Australia national cricket team|Australia]] and [[New Zealand national cricket team|New Zealand]] contested the very first [[Twenty20 cricket]] international match. Both teams appeared in retro 1980s-style tight-fitting [[One Day International|one day international]] uniforms without team names, numbers or sponsors' logos. The Australians wore their original "yellow and gold" whilst New Zealand were in "beige" inspired by the [[Beige Brigade]] sports fans. The game was played in a light-hearted manner with both teams sporting 1980s-style head bands, moustaches and hairstyles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://content-uk.cricinfo.com/ci/content/image/163829.html|title=Cricket Photos – Latest cricket images – ESPN Cricinfo|work=cricinfo.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Cycling ==
When [[Lance Armstrong]] won his fifth Tour de France championship, in 2003, his [[U.S. Postal Service]]-sponsored team wore a special jersey sporting the old U.S. Mail logo from the 1970s for the final day of the race. This was not technically a throwback jersey, as the team itself did not exist in that era, and had only been affiliated with USPS since 1998.

== Ice hockey ==

=== National Hockey League ===
{{unreferenced section|date=August 2013}}
Throwbacks were first introduced in the [[National Hockey League]] in their 75th [[anniversary]] season of [[1991–92 NHL season|1991–92]]. At the time, only the [[Original Six]] teams wore throwbacks, although they were also used in the All-Star game.

While the NHL had long since replaced the heavy wool sweaters with more modern air-knit jerseys, the patterns for the 75th anniversary throwbacks were consistent with the original versions, with a few exceptions (as noted below). Player surnames were worn on the back of the throwback jerseys, even though this was not originally the case (the NHL did not require names on the jerseys until 1977).

The Original Six teams' throwbacks included the following modifications:
* [[Boston Bruins]] – c. 1927 through 1931 "shield logo" design &lt;br /&gt; The Bruins' colors were brown and gold during this era, but the throwback jerseys use a "basic black" scheme with a small amount of white and gold trim, with the "shield logo" on the front of the jersey, and the "spoked-B" modern day regular logo placed on the jersey shoulders. For the [[2010 NHL Winter Classic|Winter Classic]] that they hosted at [[Fenway Park]] on January 1, [[2009–10 NHL season|2010]], they wore adapted replicas of the first "Spoked B" logo from 1947 to 1948 on the 1955–58 gold jerseys.
* [[Chicago Blackhawks]] – c. 1940 design &lt;br /&gt; The Blackhawks' "[[barber pole]]" design was used one more time, in a game against Detroit at [[Chicago Stadium]] in January 1994. A c.-1936 design, featuring beige in the color scheme, was used in the [[2009 NHL Winter Classic]] on January 1, [[2008–09 NHL season|2009]] at [[Chicago]]'s [[Wrigley Field]]; it would become the team's third jersey for the [[2009–10 NHL season|2009–10 season]].
* [[Detroit Red Wings]] – c. 1928 design &lt;br /&gt; At the time the design was originally worn, the Red Wings were known as the Cougars. They wore their throwbacks again in the aforementioned game at Chicago Stadium in 1994. (The design was also used by [[Wayne Gretzky]]'s team of All-Stars that toured Europe during the [[1994–95 NHL lockout]], and by the [[Adirondack Red Wings]] as a [[third jersey]]). For the Winter Classic in 2009, the Wings donned a modified version of their inaugural 1926 sweater, which featured a single red stripe across the chest with a stylized "D" in the center, along with the current winged wheel logo to the shoulders.
* [[Montreal Canadiens]] – c. 1926 design &lt;br /&gt; The Canadiens' red jerseys have changed very little. The differences between the throwback and their current jersey were the crew collar and the duplicate Canadiens logo on the left sleeve. Three "retro" jersey designs from the Canadiens' past were authorized as part of the team's centennial celebration in 2009, including a "barber pole" design of red, white and blue horizontal stripes.
* [[New York Rangers]] – c. 1940 design &lt;br /&gt; This jersey was notable because it was of the style the Rangers wore when they had last won the [[Stanley Cup]]. (They won the cup again [[1994 Stanley Cup Finals|two years later]].)
* [[Toronto Maple Leafs]] – c. 1940 design &lt;br /&gt; The two-stripe design was used for many years by the Maple Leafs, and after over two decades of the single-stripe design, the Leafs adopted a new version of the two-stripe design the following season.
* [[Wales Conference]] All-Stars – c. 1952 design (white)
* [[Campbell Conference]] All-Stars – c. 1952 design (red) &lt;br /&gt; The stripes running down the sleeves of the All-Star jerseys were wider than those on the original versions.

As other leagues began using throwbacks, interest in retro jerseys increased within the NHL. To celebrate new ownership, the [[New York Islanders]] wore a modified throwback design for one game in 1998. The [[Buffalo Sabres]] pulled a similar stunt for a game in 2003. The Toronto Maple Leafs also brought back a 1960s-era jersey as a [[third jersey]] beginning in [[1998–99 NHL season|1998–99]]. In [[2003–04 NHL season|2003–04]], the NHL implemented a Vintage program, allowing several teams to wear throwback uniforms that were specially branded with a vintage "V" patch. The following teams were among those that participated in the program:
* [[Boston Bruins]] – c. 1970s uniforms &lt;br /&gt; These were notable as the [[Bobby Orr]]-era uniforms. The black throwbacks would replace the gold third jerseys in [[2006–07 NHL season|2006]].
* [[Edmonton Oilers]] – c. 1990s uniforms &lt;br /&gt; The current Oilers only wore the white uniforms once, for the [[2003 Heritage Classic|Heritage Classic]]. The Oilers alumni wore the blue version for the preceding MegaStars game. For 2008–09, this uniform served as the Oilers' third jersey and became the team's primary jersey in 2009–10.
* [[Los Angeles Kings]] – c. 1977 uniforms
* [[Montreal Canadiens]] – c. 1946 (white), c. 1960 (red) &lt;br /&gt; The white throwbacks, similar in design to the red jersey with its blue-and-white stripe across the chest, continued to be worn as an alternate jersey in subsequent seasons. The red throwbacks featured a tie-up collar, a design feature that has seen a comeback in recent years, although it's there strictly for aesthetic purposes.
* [[New York Islanders]] – [[1972–73 NHL season|1972–73]] &lt;br /&gt; This uniform, from the team's first season featured similar-(though not the same)colored numbers on similar (though not the same)-colored trim against a royal blue background, serving as the 2008–09 and 2009–10 third jersey, was elevated to their full-time home uniform in 2010–11.
* [[New York Rangers]] – c. 1977 uniforms &lt;br /&gt; This uniform featured the team's shield logo instead of "RANGERS" written diagonally across the chest. Ironically, these throwback jerseys were actually newer in design than their regular jerseys.
* [[St. Louis Blues]] – c. 1979 uniforms &lt;br /&gt; Their then-current uniforms, introduced in 1998, were at least partially inspired by these uniforms.
* [[Vancouver Canucks]] – c. 1977 uniforms &lt;br /&gt; The blue throwbacks would replace their screen-printed red/blue alternate in 2006. These throwbacks served as the basis for Vancouver's new uniforms in 2007.
* [[Philadelphia Flyers]] – c. 1974 uniforms &lt;br /&gt; The first two times the Flyers wore these jerseys, the numbers were the same as the old ones. The numbers on the throwbacks worn in 2008–09 are the same as the numbers on their current road and third jerseys. These will serve as the Flyers' primary home jerseys for the 2009–10 season; a white version was used for the Winter Classic at Fenway Park January 1; these will serve as of 2010–11 as their road uniforms.

A few teams also introduced "fauxback" uniform (a term that was coined by Paul Lukas, the creator of the Uni Watch column and blog, for a uniform design not worn in the past, but given the appearance of decades-old vintage) designs as alternate jerseys. The [[Colorado Avalanche]] introduced burgundy third jerseys similar in design to the [[New York Rangers]]' blue ones, while the [[Minnesota Wild]] introduced a red alternate featuring a logo encased in a circle containing the team's name, a feature previously used by the Blackhawks and [[Pittsburgh Penguins]]. The [[2004 National Hockey League All-Star Game]] also featured faux throwback designs. The Sabres introduced a "fauxback" jersey designed as an homage to its [[American Hockey League]] predecessor, the [[Buffalo Bisons (AHL)|Bisons]], in 2010 and wore it as their third jersey until 2012.

The Bruins, Canadiens, Maple Leafs, and Canucks used their throwbacks through [[2006–07 NHL season|2006–07]]. The [[Buffalo Sabres]] also wore a throwback blue-and-gold jersey for one season, bringing it back again in 2008–09, and making it their 2009–10 home sweater. Although third jerseys were temporarily discontinued for [[2007–08 NHL season|2007–08]] so that teams could get used to the new [[Rbk Edge]] uniforms (third jerseys returned for the [[2008–09 NHL season|2008–09 season]]), Boston and Vancouver have adopted new uniforms that are based on their throwback designs.

On January 1, 2008, the Sabres and the Penguins donned throwback uniforms in the [[AMP Energy NHL Winter Classic]] at [[Ralph Wilson Stadium]] in [[Orchard Park, New York]], albeit with [[Reebok]]'s "Edge" [[Pattern (sewing)|design template]]. The Penguins also used the throwbacks as their third jersey for the 2008–09 season. And as mentioned earlier, at the 2009 NHL Winter Classic, the Blackhawks and the Red Wings wore throwback replicas at Wrigley Field and the Flyers and Bruins donned retro schemes at Fenway Park in 2010. For the 2011 game, the Penguins (1967–68) and their opposition, the [[2010–11 Washington Capitals season|Washington Capitals]] (1974–75) are expected to wear their first season replicates.

In recent years, [[CCM (The Hockey Company)|CCM]], now owned by Reebok, has made additional replica throwbacks available for sale, in addition to those in current use. 1992 throwbacks such as Detroit's and Chicago's were among those reissued, while others included older-era jerseys of current NHL teams the [[Phoenix Coyotes]], the [[Colorado Avalanche]], the [[Dallas Stars]], the [[Carolina Hurricanes]] and the [[New Jersey Devils]] when they had played in their former markets of (Winnipeg, Quebec City, Bloomington, Minnesota, Hartford and Denver). The much-maligned "Flying-V" uniforms of the [[Vancouver Canucks]] were also reissued. The Winnipeg jerseys were particularly popular and were seen throughout Winnipeg after it became clear that a new [[Winnipeg Jets]] franchise would be established in 2011; Jets jerseys were prevalent at the [[2011 NHL Draft]], where the new Jets' name was revealed.

==Early beginnings==

The company was founded in 1997 by [[David Beno Benveniste|David "Beno" Benveniste]], expanding out of Benveniste's independent music management practice. Beno was born and raised in [[Beverly Hills]], [[California]], and graduated from the [[University of Southern California]].  He began a career in the [[music industry]] after developing the band [[System of a Down]].  Through his creation of the marketing company Streetwise Concepts and Culture, a fan volunteer network that assembled over the Internet for grassroots promotion, Beno tapped into the power of youth marketing to promote the group.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.nytimes.com/2000/05/04/arts/out-on-the-street-cyber-and-otherwise.html?src=pm | title = Out on the Street, Cyber or Otherwise | accessdate = 2011-04-04 | last = Strauss | first = Neil | date = 2000-05-04 | work = The New York Times }}&lt;/ref&gt; Within three years, he was able to build an army of over 30,000 kids through the platform to distribute promotional items to their friends on behalf of bands he managed through “hand-to-hand” promotion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,1000410,00.html | title = Search for a Perfect Pitch | accessdate = 2011-04-04 | last = Ressner | first = Jeffrey | date = 2001-07-23 | work = Time }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Moving the business forward==

In 2004, Benveniste signed a [[joint venture]] deal to move the Velvet Hammer music label from [[Atlantic Records]] to [[Columbia Records]] over a several year period.&lt;ref name="Hammer"&gt;''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]''. (2004-12-18) [http://www.allbusiness.com/retail-trade/miscellaneous-retail-retail-stores-not/4645098-1.html Benveniste brings Hammer down on joint venture deal] hosted at allbusiness.com. Retrieved 2008-09-09.&lt;/ref&gt; Under the terms of the deal, Velvet Hammer clients [[Taproot (band)|Taproot]], [[Poison the Well (band)|Poison the Well]] and [[Gratitude (band)|Gratitude]] would continue to record with Atlantic, while Benveniste signed [[OneRepublic]] to Columbia. Afterwards, [[Sony/ATV]] and Velvet Hammer Music collaborated to publish the [[ASCAP]] award winning song "Apologize" by [[OneRepublic]].&lt;ref name="Hammer"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Sony/ATV]]. [http://www.sonyatv.com/index.php/news/378]. Retrieved 2008-09-09.&lt;/ref&gt; Benveniste already had a long established relationship with Columbia and its parent, [[Sony]], having first brought [[System of a Down]] to Columbia in 1996 and at one time managing [[Mudvayne]], signed to Sony's [[Epic Records]].&lt;ref name="Hammer"/&gt; In 2008, Velvet Hammer signed a three-year deal with Sony subsidiary [[RED Distribution]], which handled the marketing and publicity for Taproot's album ''[[Our Long Road Home]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Harding, Cortney.

In 1999, Velvet Hammer was drawn into a feud with [[Fred Durst]] of [[Limp Bizkit]] when [[Taproot (band)|Taproot]] chose to sign with Velvet Hammer Management rather than [[Interscope]].&lt;ref&gt;Mancini, Robert.

'''"Youth"''' is an autobiographical short story by [[Joseph Conrad]]. Written in 1898, it was first published in ''[[Blackwood's Magazine]]'', and included as the first story in the 1902 volume ''Youth, a Narrative, and Two Other Stories''. This volume also includes ''[[Heart of Darkness]]'' and ''The End of the Tether'', stories concerned with the themes of maturity and old age, respectively. "Youth" depicts a young man's first journey to the East. It is narrated by [[Charles Marlow]] who is also the narrator of ''[[Lord Jim]]'', ''[[Chance (Conrad novel)|Chance]]'', and ''Heart of Darkness''. The narrator's introduction suggests this is the first time, chronologically, the character Marlow appears in Conrad's works (the narrator comments that he thinks Marlow spells his name this way).

==Plot==
Similar to Joseph Conrad's better-known ''[[Heart of Darkness]]'', ''Youth'' begins with a narrator describing five men drinking claret around a mahogany table. They are all veterans of the merchant navy. One of the men, Marlow speaks of his first voyage to the East as second mate on board the ''Judea''. The story is set twenty-two years earlier, when Marlow was 20. With two years of experience, most recently as third mate aboard a crack clipper, Marlow receives a billet as second mate on the [[barque]] ''Judea''. The skipper is Captain John Beard, a man of about 60. This is Beard's first command. The ''Judea'' is an old boat, belonging to a man "Wilmer, Wilcox or something similar", suffering from age and disuse in [[Shadwell Basin|Shadewell basin]]. The 400-ton ship is commissioned to take 600 tons of coal from England to Thailand. The trip should take approximately 150 days. The ship leaves London loaded with sand ballast and heads north to the Senn river to pick up the cargo of coal. On her way, the ''Judea'' suffers from her ballast shifting aside and the crew go below to put things right again. The trip takes 16 days because of 'the famous October gale of twenty-two years ago', and the battered ship must use a tug boat to get into port. The ''Judea'' waits a month on the [[river Tyne|Tyne]] to be loaded with coal. The night before she ships out she is hit by a steamer, the ''Miranda'' or the ''Melissa''. The damage takes another three weeks to repair. Three months after leaving London, the ''Judea'' ships off for [[Bangkok]].

The ''Judea'' travels through the [[North Sea]] and Britain. 300 miles west of [[the Lizard]] a fiery winter storm hits. The storm "guts" the ''Judea''; she is stripped of her stanchions, ventilators, bulwarks, cabin-door, and deck house. The oakum is stripped from her bottom seams and the men are forced to work at the pumps "watch and watch" to keep the ship afloat. After weathering the storm they must fight their way against the wind back to [[Falmouth, Cornwall|Falmouth]] to be refitted. Despite three attempts to leave, the ''Judea'' ultimately remains in Falmouth for more than six months until she is finally overhauled, recaulked, and refitted with new copper hull sheathing. During the laborious overhaul, the cargo is wetted, knocked about, and reloaded multiple times. The rats abandon the reshipped barque and a new crew is brought in from Liverpool (because no sailor will sail on a ship abandoned by rats).

The ''Judea'' ships out to Bangkok, running at times 8 knots, but mostly averaging 3 miles per hour. Near the coast of Western Australia, the cargo spontaneously combusts. The crew attempts to smother the fire, but the hull cannot be made airtight. Then they attempt to flood the fire with water, but they cannot fill the hull. One hundred and ninety miles out from Java Head, the gases in the hull explode and blow up the deck; Marlow is hurled into the air and falls on the burning debris of the deck. The ''Judea'' hails a passing steamer, the ''Sommerville'', which agrees to tow the wounded ship to [[Anjer]] or [[Batavia, Dutch East Indies|Batavia]]. Captain Beard intends to scuttle the ''Judea'' there to put out the fire, and then resurface her and resume the voyage to Bangkok. However, the speed of the ''Sommerville'' fans the smoldering fire into flames. The crew of the ''Judea'' is forced to send the steamer on without them while they attempt to save possibly most of the ship's gear for the underwriters. The gear is loaded into three small boats, which head due north towards [[Java]]. Before the crew leaves the ''Judea'', they enjoy a last meal on deck. Marlow becomes skipper of the smallest of the ship's three boats. All the boats make it safely into a Java port, where they book passage on the steamer ''Celestial'', which is on her return trip to England.

The story is loosely based upon reality. One of Conrad's pen-pals, or friends, discovered the secret of the port at which the boats called: the port was Muntok. Conrad became angry with him, calling Muntok 'a beastly hole'. The boats of the real ship reached the safety only after several hours, Marlow was a bit younger than Conrad, etc.{{Citation needed|reason=Unclear where data is sourced from|date=March 2018}}
