The '''algebra of sets''' defines the properties and laws of [[Set (mathematics)|sets]], the set-theoretic [[operation (mathematics)|operations]] of [[union (set theory)|union]], [[intersection (set theory)|intersection]], and [[complement (set theory)|complementation]] and the [[binary relation|relations]] of set [[equality (mathematics)|equality]] and set [[subset|inclusion]]. It also provides systematic procedures for evaluating expressions, and performing calculations, involving these operations and relations.

Any set of sets closed under the set-theoretic operations forms a [[Boolean algebra (structure)|Boolean algebra]] with the join operator being ''union'', the meet operator being ''intersection'', the complement operator being ''set complement'', the bottom being &lt;math&gt;\varnothing&lt;/math&gt; and the top being the [[universe (mathematics)|universe set under consideration]].

==Fundamentals==

The algebra of sets is the set-theoretic analogue of the algebra of numbers. Just as arithmetic [[addition]] and [[multiplication]] are [[associativity|associative]] and [[commutativity|commutative]], so are set union and intersection; just as the arithmetic relation "less than or equal" is [[Reflexive relation|reflexive]], [[Antisymmetric relation|antisymmetric]] and [[transitive relation|transitive]], so is the set relation of "subset".

It is the algebra of the set-theoretic operations of union, intersection and complementation, and the relations of equality and inclusion.  For a basic introduction to sets see the article on [[Set (mathematics)|sets]], for a fuller account see [[naive set theory]], and for a full rigorous [[axiom]]atic treatment see [[axiomatic set theory]].

==The fundamental laws of set algebra==&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[Subset]] --&gt;

The [[binary operation]]s of set [[Union (set theory)|union]] (&lt;math&gt;\cup&lt;/math&gt;) and [[intersection (set theory)|intersection]] (&lt;math&gt;\cap&lt;/math&gt;) satisfy many [[identity (mathematics)|identities]]. Several of these identities or "laws" have well established names.

:[[commutative operation|Commutative]] laws:
::*&lt;math&gt;A \cup B = B \cup A&lt;/math&gt;
::*&lt;math&gt;A \cap B = B \cap A&lt;/math&gt;
:[[associativity|Associative]] laws:
::*&lt;math&gt;(A \cup B) \cup C = A \cup (B \cup C)&lt;/math&gt;
::*&lt;math&gt;(A \cap B) \cap C = A \cap (B \cap C)&lt;/math&gt;
:[[distributivity|Distributive]] laws:
::*&lt;math&gt;A \cup (B \cap C) = (A \cup B) \cap (A \cup C)&lt;/math&gt;
::*&lt;math&gt;A \cap (B \cup C) = (A \cap B) \cup (A \cap C)&lt;/math&gt;

The union and intersection of sets may be seen as analogous to the addition and multiplication of numbers. Like addition and multiplication, the operations of union and intersection are commutative and associative, and intersection ''distributes'' over union.  However, unlike addition and multiplication, union also distributes over intersection.

Two additional pairs of laws involve the special sets called the [[empty set]] Ø and the [[universe (mathematics)|universe set]] &lt;math&gt;U&lt;/math&gt;; together with the [[complement (set theory)|complement]] operator (&lt;math&gt;A^C&lt;/math&gt; denotes the complement of &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt;. This can also be written as &lt;math&gt;A^'&lt;/math&gt;, read as A prime).  The empty set has no members, and the universe set has all possible members (in a particular context).

:Identity laws:
::*&lt;math&gt;A \cup \varnothing = A&lt;/math&gt;
::*&lt;math&gt;A \cap U = A&lt;/math&gt;
:Complement laws:
::*&lt;math&gt;A \cup A^C = U&lt;/math&gt;
::*&lt;math&gt;A \cap A^C = \varnothing&lt;/math&gt;

The identity laws (together with the commutative laws) say that, just like 0 and 1 for addition and  multiplication, Ø and '''U''' are the [[identity element]]s for union and intersection, respectively.

Unlike addition and multiplication, union and intersection do not have [[inverse element]]s. However the complement laws give the fundamental properties of the somewhat inverse-like [[unary operation]] of set complementation.

The preceding five pairs of laws&amp;mdash;the commutative, associative, distributive, identity and complement laws&amp;mdash;encompass all of set algebra, in the sense that every valid proposition in the algebra of sets can be derived from them.

Note that if the complement laws are weakened to the rule &lt;math&gt; (A^C)^C = A &lt;/math&gt;, then this is exactly the algebra of propositional [[linear logic]]{{clarify|reason=Explain which set operator corresponds to which linear-logic operator. Linear logic seems to have much more operators than a boolean algebra, but the section 'Algebraic semantics' of the 'linear logic' article is still unwritten.|date=August 2013}}.

==The principle of duality==
&lt;!-- linked from redirect [[Duality principle for sets]] --&gt;
{{See also|Duality (order theory)}}
Each of the identities stated above is one of a pair of identities such that each can be transformed into the other by interchanging ∪ and ∩, and also Ø and '''U'''.

These are examples of an extremely important and powerful property of set algebra, namely, the '''principle of duality''' for sets, which asserts that for any true statement about sets, the '''dual''' statement obtained by interchanging unions and intersections, interchanging '''U''' and Ø and reversing inclusions is also true.  A statement is said to be '''self-dual''' if it is equal to its own dual.

== Some additional laws for unions and intersections ==

The following proposition states six more important laws of set algebra, involving unions and intersections.

'''PROPOSITION 3''': For any [[subset]]s ''A'' and ''B'' of a universe set '''U''', the following identities hold:
:[[idempotent]] laws:
::*&lt;math&gt;A \cup A = A&lt;/math&gt;
::*&lt;math&gt;A \cap A = A&lt;/math&gt;
:domination laws:
::*&lt;math&gt;A \cup U = U&lt;/math&gt;
::*&lt;math&gt;A \cap \varnothing = \varnothing&lt;/math&gt;
:[[absorption law]]s:
::*&lt;math&gt;A \cup (A \cap B) = A&lt;/math&gt;
::*&lt;math&gt;A \cap (A \cup B) = A&lt;/math&gt;

As noted above, each of the laws stated in proposition 3 can be derived from the five fundamental pairs of laws stated above&lt;!---in proposition 1 and proposition 2---&gt;.  As an illustration, a proof is given below for the idempotent law for union.

''Proof:''
{|
|-
|&lt;math&gt;A \cup A&lt;/math&gt;
|&lt;math&gt;=(A \cup A) \cap U&lt;/math&gt;
|by the identity law of intersection
|-
|
|&lt;math&gt;=(A \cup A) \cap (A \cup A^C)&lt;/math&gt;
|by the complement law for union
|-
|
|&lt;math&gt;=A \cup (A \cap A^C)&lt;/math&gt;
|by the distributive law of union over intersection
|-
|
|&lt;math&gt;=A \cup \varnothing&lt;/math&gt;
|by the complement law for intersection
|-
|
|&lt;math&gt;=A&lt;/math&gt;
|by the identity law for union
|}
The following proof illustrates that the dual of the above proof is the proof of the dual of the idempotent law for union, namely the idempotent law for intersection.

''Proof:''
{|
|-
|&lt;math&gt;A \cap A&lt;/math&gt;
|&lt;math&gt;=(A \cap A) \cup \varnothing&lt;/math&gt;
|by the identity law for union
|-
|
|&lt;math&gt;=(A \cap A) \cup (A \cap A^C)&lt;/math&gt;
|by the complement law for intersection
|-
|
|&lt;math&gt;=A \cap (A \cup A^C)&lt;/math&gt;
|by the distributive law of intersection over union
|-
|
|&lt;math&gt;=A \cap U&lt;/math&gt;
|by the complement law for union
|-
|
|&lt;math&gt;=A&lt;/math&gt;
|by the identity law for intersection
|}

Intersection can be expressed in terms of set difference :

&lt;math&gt;A \cap B = A \setminus (A \setminus B) &lt;/math&gt;

== Some additional laws for complements ==

The following proposition states five more important laws of set algebra, involving complements.

'''PROPOSITION 4''': Let ''A'' and ''B'' be [[subset]]s of a universe '''U''', then:
:[[De Morgan's laws]]:
::*&lt;math&gt;(A \cup B)^C = A^C \cap B^C&lt;/math&gt;
::*&lt;math&gt;(A \cap B)^C = A^C \cup B^C&lt;/math&gt;
:double complement or [[Involution (mathematics)|involution]] law:
::*&lt;math&gt;{(A^{C})}^{C} = A&lt;/math&gt;
:complement laws for the universe set and the empty set:
::*&lt;math&gt;\varnothing^C = U&lt;/math&gt;
::*&lt;math&gt;U^C = \varnothing&lt;/math&gt;

Notice that the double complement law is self-dual.

The next proposition, which is also self-dual, says that the complement  of a set is the only set that satisfies the complement laws.  In other words, complementation is characterized by the complement laws.

'''PROPOSITION 5''': Let ''A'' and ''B'' be subsets of a universe '''U''', then:
:uniqueness of complements:
::*If &lt;math&gt;A \cup B = U&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;A \cap B = \varnothing&lt;/math&gt;, then &lt;math&gt;B = A^C&lt;/math&gt;

==The algebra of inclusion==

The following proposition says that [[Subset|inclusion]], that is the [[binary relation]] of one set being a subset of another, is a [[partial order]].

'''PROPOSITION 6''': If ''A'', ''B'' and ''C'' are sets then the following hold:

:[[reflexive relation|reflexivity]]:
::*&lt;math&gt;A \subseteq A&lt;/math&gt;

:[[antisymmetric relation|antisymmetry]]:
::*&lt;math&gt;A \subseteq B&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;B \subseteq A&lt;/math&gt; if and only if &lt;math&gt;A = B&lt;/math&gt;

:[[transitive relation|transitivity]]:
::*If &lt;math&gt;A \subseteq B&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;B \subseteq C&lt;/math&gt;, then &lt;math&gt;A \subseteq C&lt;/math&gt;

The following proposition says that for any set ''S'', the [[power set]] of ''S'', ordered by inclusion, is a [[lattice (order)|bounded lattice]], and hence together with the distributive and complement laws above, show that it is a [[Boolean algebra (structure)|Boolean algebra]].

'''PROPOSITION 7''': If ''A'', ''B'' and ''C'' are subsets of a set ''S'' then the following hold:

:existence of a [[greatest element|least element]] and a [[greatest element]]:
::*&lt;math&gt;\varnothing \subseteq A \subseteq S&lt;/math&gt;

:existence of [[lattice (order)|joins]]:
::*&lt;math&gt;A \subseteq A \cup B&lt;/math&gt;
::*If &lt;math&gt;A \subseteq C&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;B \subseteq C&lt;/math&gt;, then &lt;math&gt;A \cup B \subseteq C&lt;/math&gt;

:existence of [[lattice (order)|meets]]:
::*&lt;math&gt;A \cap B \subseteq A&lt;/math&gt;
::*If &lt;math&gt;C \subseteq A&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;C \subseteq B&lt;/math&gt;, then &lt;math&gt;C \subseteq A \cap B&lt;/math&gt;

The following proposition says that the statement &lt;math&gt;A \subseteq B&lt;/math&gt; is equivalent to various other statements involving unions, intersections and complements.

'''PROPOSITION 8''': For any two sets ''A'' and ''B'', the following are equivalent:
:*&lt;math&gt;A \subseteq B&lt;/math&gt;
:*&lt;math&gt;A \cap B = A&lt;/math&gt;
:*&lt;math&gt;A \cup B = B&lt;/math&gt;
:*&lt;math&gt;A \smallsetminus B = \varnothing&lt;/math&gt;
:*&lt;math&gt;B^C \subseteq A^C&lt;/math&gt;

The above proposition shows that the relation of set inclusion can be characterized by either of the operations of set union or set intersection, which means that the notion of set inclusion is axiomatically superfluous.

== The algebra of relative complements ==

The following proposition lists several identities concerning [[Complement (set theory)|relative complements]] and set-theoretic differences.

'''PROPOSITION 9''': For any universe '''U''' and subsets ''A'', ''B'', and ''C'' of '''U''', the following identities hold:
:*&lt;math&gt;C \setminus (A \cap B) = (C \setminus A) \cup (C \setminus B)&lt;/math&gt;
:*&lt;math&gt;C \setminus (A \cup B) = (C \setminus A) \cap (C \setminus B)&lt;/math&gt;
:*&lt;math&gt;C \setminus (B \setminus A) = (A \cap C)\cup(C \setminus B)&lt;/math&gt;
:*&lt;math&gt;(B \setminus A) \cap C = (B \cap C) \setminus A = B \cap (C \setminus A)&lt;/math&gt;
:*&lt;math&gt;(B \setminus A) \cup C = (B \cup C) \setminus (A \setminus C)&lt;/math&gt;
:*&lt;math&gt;A \setminus A = \varnothing&lt;/math&gt;
:*&lt;math&gt;\varnothing \setminus A = \varnothing&lt;/math&gt;
:*&lt;math&gt;A \setminus \varnothing = A&lt;/math&gt;
:*&lt;math&gt;B \setminus A = A^C \cap B&lt;/math&gt;
:*&lt;math&gt;(B \setminus A)^C = A \cup B^C&lt;/math&gt;
:*&lt;math&gt;U \setminus A = A^C&lt;/math&gt;
:*&lt;math&gt;A \setminus U = \varnothing&lt;/math&gt;

'''Ancient Mesopotamian units of measurement''' originated in the loosely organized city-states of [[Early Dynastic Period of Sumer#Early Dynastic period|Early Dynastic]] [[Sumer]].  Each [[city]], [[Monarchy|kingdom]] and trade [[guild]] had its own standards until the formation of the [[Akkadian Empire]] when [[Sargon of Akkad]] issued a common standard.  This standard was improved by [[Naram-Sin of Akkad|Naram-Sin]], but fell into disuse after the Akkadian Empire dissolved.  The standard of Naram-Sin was readopted in the [[Third Dynasty of Ur|Ur III period]] by the [[Nanše Hymn]] which reduced a plethora of multiple standards to a few agreed upon common groupings.  Successors to Sumerian civilization including the Babylonians, Assyrians, and Persians continued to use these groupings.  Akkado-Sumerian [[metrology]] has been reconstructed by applying statistical methods to compare [[Sumerian architecture]], [[architectural plan]]s, and issued official standards such as [[Statues of Gudea|Statue B of Gudea]] and the bronze [[cubit]] of [[Nippur]].

==Archaic system==
[[File:Gudea of Lagash Girsu.png|thumbnail|right|[[Statues of Gudea|Gudea Statue I]] carved diorite ]]
The systems that would later become the classical standard for Mesopotamia were developed in parallel with writing during [[Uruk period|Uruk Period Sumer]] (c 4000 BCE).  Studies of [[Cuneiform|protocuneiform]] indicate twelve separate counting systems used in Uruk.  
* '''Sexagesimal System S''' used to count slaves, animals, fish, wooden objects, stone objects, containers.
* '''Sexagesimal System S'''' used to count dead animals, certain types of beer
* '''Bi-Sexagesimal System B''' used to count cereal, bread, fish, milk products
* '''Bi-Sexagesimal System B&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt;''' used to count rations
* '''GAN&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; System G''' used to count field measurement
* '''ŠE system Š''' used to count barley by volume
* '''ŠE system Š'''' used to count malt by volume
* '''ŠE system Š"''' used to count wheat by volume
* '''ŠE System Š&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt;''' used to count barley groats
* '''EN System E''' used to count weight
* '''U&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; System U''' used to count calendrics
* '''DUG&lt;sub&gt;b&lt;/sub&gt; System Db''' used to count milk by volume
* '''DUG&lt;sub&gt;c&lt;/sub&gt; System Db''' used to count beer by volume
 
In Early Dynastic Sumer (c 2900–2300 BCE) [[metrology]] and mathematics were indistinguishable and treated as a single scribal discipline.  The idea of an abstract number did not yet exist, thus all quantities were written as metrological symbols and never as [[numeral system|numeral]]s followed by a unit symbol.  For example there was a symbol for one-sheep and another for one-day but no symbol for one.  About 600 of these metrological symbols exist, for this reason archaic Sumerian metrology is complex and not fully understood.&lt;ref name="Melville 2006"&gt;Melville 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;  In general however, length, volume, and mass are derived from a theoretical standard cube, called 'gur', filled with barley, wheat, water, or oil.  The mass of a gur-cube, called 'gun&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;' is defined as the weight a laden [[donkey|ass]] can carry.  However, because of the different [[specific gravities]] of these substances combined with dual numerical bases ([[sexagesimal]] or [[decimal]]), multiple sizes of the gur-cube were used without consensus.  The different gur-cubes are related by proportion, based on the water gur-cube, according to four basic coefficients and their cubic roots.{{citation needed|date=September 2013}}  These coefficients are given as:

*'''Komma''' =  &lt;math&gt;80/81&lt;/math&gt; correction when planning rations with a 360-day year
*'''Leimma''' =  &lt;math&gt;24/25&lt;/math&gt; conversion from decimal to a sexagesimal number system
*'''Diesis''' =  &lt;math&gt;15/16&lt;/math&gt;
*'''Euboic''' =  &lt;math&gt;5/6&lt;/math&gt;

One official government standard of measurement of the archaic system was the '''Cubit of Nippur''' (2650 BCE).  It is a Euboic ''Mana'' + 1 Diesis (432'''g''').{{citation needed|date=September 2013}}  This standard is the main reference used by archaeologists to reconstruct the system.

==Classical system==
[[File:Royal gur.svg|thumb|right|300px|Royal Gur Cube of Naram-Sin]]
A major improvement came in 2150 BCE during the [[Akkadian Empire]] under the reign of [[Naram-Sin of Akkad|Naram-Sin]] when the competing systems were unified by a single official standard, the royal gur-cube.&lt;ref name="Powell 1995, p.1955"&gt;Powell 1995, p.1955.&lt;/ref&gt;  His reform is considered the first standardized system of measure in Mesopotamia.&lt;ref name="Powell 1995, p.1955" /&gt;  The royal gur-cube ([[Cuneiform]]: LU&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;.GAL.GUR, {{cuneiform|&amp;#x1221A;}}{{cuneiform|&amp;#x12125;}}; [[Akkadian language|Akkadian]]: ''šarru kurru'') was a theoretical cuboid of water approximately 6'''m''' × 6'''m''' × 0.5'''m''' from which all other units could be derived.  The [[Third Dynasty of Ur|Neo-Sumerians]] continued use of the royal gur-cube as indicated by the [[Letter of Nanse]] issued in 2000 BCE by [[Gudea]] .  Use of the same standard continued through the [[Babylonia]]n, [[Assyrian Empire|Assyrian]], and [[Persian Empire]]s.&lt;ref name="Melville 2006" /&gt;

Units of length are prefixed by the logogram DU ({{cuneiform|&amp;#x1207A;}}) a convention of the archaic period counting system from which it was evolved.  Basic length was used in architecture and field division.

===Area===
The '''GAN&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; system G''' counting system evolved into area measurements.  A special unit measuring brick quantity by area was called the brick-garden (Cuneiform: SIG.SAR {{cuneiform|&amp;#x122AC;}}{{cuneiform|&amp;#x122DE;}}; Sumerian: šeg&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt;-sar; Akkadian: ''libittu''-''mūšaru'') which held 720 bricks.

===Time===

{{main|Babylonian calendar}}
In the Archaic System time notation was written in the '''U&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; System U'''.  Multiple [[lunisolar calendar]]s existed; however the civil calendar from the holy city of [[Nippur]] ([[Ur III period]]) was adopted by Babylon as their civil calendar.&lt;ref&gt;Ronan, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;  The calendar of Nippur dates to 3500 BCE and was itself based on older astronomical knowledge of an uncertain origin.  The main astronomical cycles used to construct the calendar were the [[synodic month]], [[equinox year]], and [[sidereal day]].

==Relationship to other metrologies==
The Classical Mesopotamian system formed the basis for [[Elam]]ite, Hebrew, [[Urartu|Urartian]], Hurrian, Hittite, [[Ugarit]]ic, [[Phoenicia]]n, Babylonian, Assyrian, Persian, Arabic, and Islamic metrologies.&lt;ref&gt;Conder 1908, p. 87.&lt;/ref&gt;  The Classical Mesopotamian System also has a proportional relationship, by virtue of standardized commerce, to [[Bronze Age]] Harappan and Egyptian metrologies.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2272">An '''aretology''' (from ancient Greek [[arete (moral virtue)|aretê]], "excellence, virtue") in the strictest sense is a narrative about a divine figure's miraculous deeds. In the [[Greco-Roman world]], aretologies represent a religious branch of [[rhetoric]] and are a prose development of the [[hymn]] as praise poetry. [[Asclepius]], [[Isis]], and [[Serapis]] are among the deities with surviving aretologies in the form of [[epigraphy|inscriptions]] and [[papyri]].&lt;ref&gt;Laurent Pernot, ''Rhetoric in Antiquity,'' translated by W.E. Higgins (Catholic University of America Press, 2005), p. 80&lt;/ref&gt; The Greek ''aretologos'' (ἀρετολόγος, "virtue-speaker") was a temple official who recounted aretologies and may have also interpreted dreams.&lt;ref&gt;Christopher Walter, ''The Warrior Saints in Byzantine Art and Tradition'' (Ashgate, 2003), p. 17.&lt;/ref&gt;

By extension, an aretology is also a "catalogue of virtues" belonging to a person; for example, [[Cicero]]'s list and description of the virtues of [[Pompey the Great|Pompeius Magnus ("Pompey the Great")]] in the speech ''[[Pro Lege Manilia]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Roger Rees, "Panegyric," in "''A Companion to Roman Rhetoric'' (Blackwell, 2007), p. 140.&lt;/ref&gt; Aretology became part of the Christian rhetorical tradition of [[hagiography]].&lt;ref&gt;Walter, ''The Warrior Saints,'' p. 17; Alistair Stewart-Sykes, ''From Prophecy to Preaching: A Search for the Origins of the Christian Homily'' (Brill, 2001), p. 75.&lt;/ref&gt;

In an even more expanded sense, aretology is [[moral philosophy]] which deals with [[virtue]], its nature, and the means of arriving at it.{{cn|date=December 2012}} It is the title of an ethical tract by [[Robert Boyle]] published in the 1640s.&lt;ref&gt;John T. Harwood, ''The Early Essays and Ethics of Robert Boyle'' (Southern Illinois University Press, 1991), p. xvii.&lt;/ref&gt;

Gionet participated in the "Freedom of Speech" rally outside the Lincoln Memorial in Washington, DC on June 25, 2017, and he was scheduled to address [[white nationalists]] at the [[Unite the Right rally]] in [[Charlottesville, Virginia]] on August 11, 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Porter|first1=Tom|title=Who are the Alt-Right Leaders Addressing the White Nationalist Rally in Charlottesville?|url=http://www.newsweek.com/alt-right-leaders-are-addressing-largest-white-nationalist-rally-decades-650096|website=Newsweek|accessdate=August 18, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Tognotti" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2759">'''Basic goodness''' is a term coined by Tibetan spiritual teacher [[Chögyam Trungpa Rinpoche]] and is a core concept in his [[terma (religion)|terma]]. It is used both to discuss the experience of reality and also basic human [[virtue]].

In his 1980 Seminary he associates this term with both absolute [[bodhicitta]] and specifically the Tibetan term kun.gzhi.ngang.lugs.kyi.dge.ba which comes from the [[Kadam (Tibetan Buddhism)|Kadam]] tradition and refers to the natural virtues of the kunshi or [[alaya]]. Specifically he described three virtues: ''unborn'' meaning non-manufactured; ''nondwelling'' meaning that it cannot be pinned down, and ''free from pigeonholing'' meaning that it is beyond conceptual reference points.&lt;ref&gt;Trungpa (1980) Mayahana Seminary Transcript, pgs 91-94&lt;/ref&gt; In his 1981 Seminary he described it as also referring to personal wholesomeness and dedication to others.&lt;ref&gt;Trungpa (1981) Mayahana Seminary Transcript, pg 89&lt;/ref&gt;

Melvin McLeod explains the term with ''basic'' indicating the primordial, self-existing nature and ''goodness'' indicating a faultless aspect.&lt;ref&gt;Mindful politics: a Buddhist guide to making the world a better place By Melvin McLeod; pp92-93&lt;/ref&gt; John Miller associated the term with [[Buddha-nature]].&lt;ref&gt;The holistic curriculum By John P. Miller; p29&lt;/ref&gt;

Trungpa Rinpoche's son, Sakyong Mipham Rinpoche, expressed the relationship between basic goodness and enlightened society in these words: "In essence, the emphasis of the Buddhist path is to help us attain enlightenment, and the emphasis of the Shambhala path is to help us create and maintain a good society. When we put these two together, we have the Shambhalian Buddhist view of enlightened society. Thus the two paths work in tandem, not in competition."

A '''bond vigilante''' is a [[bond (finance)|bond]] market investor who protests monetary or fiscal policies they consider inflationary by selling bonds, thus increasing [[Yield (finance)|yields]].&lt;ref name="bloomberg"&gt;May 29, 2009. [http://bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=20601087&amp;sid=a6eMpGVUDeeE&amp;refer=home Bloomberg - Bond Vigilantes Confront Obama as Housing Falters] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090123033802/http://bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=20601087&amp;sid=a6eMpGVUDeeE&amp;refer=home |date=January 23, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  

In the [[bond market]], prices move inversely to yields.  When investors perceive that inflation risk or credit risk is rising they demand higher yields to compensate for the added risk.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.investmentrarities.com/thebestofrr04-29-04.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-01-30 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080430095009/http://www.investmentrarities.com/thebestofrr04-29-04.html |archivedate=2008-04-30 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  As a result, bond prices fall and yields rise, which increases the net cost of borrowing. The term references the ability of the bond market to serve as a restraint on the government's ability to over-spend and over-borrow.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.marketwatch.com/story/the-bond-vigilantes-return-or-bad-ideas-never-die-2017-01-11 |title=Don’t expect the bond vigilantes to do the Fed’s work |date=January 11, 2017 |author=Caroline Baum}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==United States==
===Clinton administration===
From October 1993 to November 1994 US 10-year yields climbed from 5.2% to just over 8.0% fueled by concerns about federal spending in what became informally known as the "[[Great Bond Massacre]]".  With some guidance from [[Robert Rubin]], the [[United States Secretary of the Treasury]], the Clinton Administration and Congress made an effort to reduce the deficit.  10-year yields dropped to approximately 4% by November 1998.&lt;ref name="bloomberg" /&gt; 

Clinton political adviser [[James Carville]] said at the time that “I used to think that if there was reincarnation, I wanted to come back as the president or the pope or as a .400 baseball hitter. But now I would like to come back as the bond market. You can intimidate everybody." &lt;ref name="bloomberg" /&gt;

===Obama administration===
During the Obama administration some suggest that bond vigilantes were making a return with worries over sustainability and budgetary responsibility.  Mark MacQueen, a partner and money manager at Austin, Texas-based Sage Advisory Services Ltd., said “The vigilante group is different this time around.  It’s major foreign creditors. This whole idea that we need to spend our way out of our problems is being questioned."&lt;ref name="bloomberg" /&gt; However, economist [[Paul Krugman]] and other [[New Keynesian]]s pointed out that there was no evidence for bond vigilante activity by pointing out the fact that 10-year yields remained quite low.&lt;ref name="krugman"&gt;https://krugman.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/11/19/invisible-bond-vigilantes/&lt;/ref&gt;

==Eurozone==
During the [[Eurozone crisis]] that started in 2009, bond vigilantes were blamed for pushing up the government borrowing in the [[PIIGS]] countries.  However Ed Yardini, who coined the term Bond Vigilantes in the 1980s, said that actions of central banks were able to keep rates low against the pressure of the vigilantes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_DQHLqhM2uA |title=Ed Yardeni: "Bond Vigilantes" Get to Work in the Eurozone |publisher=NZZ Capital Markets forum |year=2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Septic tank EN.svg|thumb|right|Scheme of a cesspit which is constructed like an underground holding tank]]
A '''cesspit''' (or '''cesspool''' or '''soak pit''' in some contexts), is a term with various meanings: it is used to describe either an underground holding tank (sealed at the bottom) or a soak pit (not sealed at the bottom).&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite book|isbn=978-3-906484-57-0|url = http://www.eawag.ch/forschung/sandec/publikationen/compendium_e/index_EN|title = Compendium of Sanitation Systems and Technologies - (2nd Revised 2rEdition)|author1=Tilley, E. |author2=Ulrich, L. |author3=Lüthi, C. |author4=Reymond, Ph. |author5=Zurbrügg, C. |publisher = Swiss Federal Institute of Aquatic Science and Technology (Eawag), Duebendorf, Switzerland}}&lt;/ref&gt; It can be used for the temporary collection and storage of [[Human feces|feces]], excreta or fecal sludge as part of an on-site [[sanitation]] system and has some similarities with [[septic tank]]s or with soak pits. Traditionally, it was a deep cylindrical chamber dug into the earth, having approximate dimensions of 1 metre diameter and 2–3 metres depth. Their appearance was similar to that of a hand-dug water well.

The pit can be lined with bricks or concrete, covered with a slab and needing to be emptied frequently when it is used like an underground holding tank.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  In other cases (if soil and [[groundwater]] conditions allow), it is not constructed watertight, to allow liquid to leach out (similar to a [[pit latrine]] or to a soak pit).

== Uses ==
[[File:Cess Pool in Slovakia.jpg|thumb|An empty, old cesspool in Slovakia]]
=== Holding tank ===
In the UK a cesspit is a sealed tank for the reception and temporary storage of [[sewage]]; in North America this is simply referred to as a "[[holding tank]]". Because it is sealed, the tank must be emptied frequently &amp;mdash; in many cases as often as weekly. Because of the need for frequent emptying, the cost of maintenance of a cesspit can be very high.

=== Infiltration systems ===
A cesspool was at one time{{when|date=April 2016}} built like a [[dry well]] lined with loose-fitting brick or stone, used for the disposal of sewage via infiltration into the soil. Liquids leaked out through the soil as conditions allowed, while solids decayed and collected as  composted matter in the base of the cesspool. As the solids accumulated, eventually the particulate solids blocked the escape of liquids, causing the cesspool to drain more slowly or to overflow.

A [[biofilm]] forms in the loose soil surrounding a cesspool or [[pit latrine]] which provides some degree of attenuation of the pollutants present, but a very deep cesspool can allow raw sewage to directly enter [[groundwater]] with minimal biological cleansing, leading to [[groundwater pollution]] and undrinkable water supplies.  It is for this reason that deep water wells on the property must be drilled far from the cesspool.

Most residential waste cesspools in use in the US today are rudimentary septic systems, consisting of a concrete-capped pit lined with [[concrete masonry unit]]s (cinder blocks) laid on their sides with perforated [[drain field]] piping ([[weeping tile]]) extending outward below the level of the intake connection. The concrete cover will often have a cleanout pipe extending above ground. Some are constructed with concrete walls on one or more sides.

The waste cesspool is vulnerable to overloading or flooding by heavy rains or snow melt because it is not enclosed and sealed like conventional septic tank systems. It is also vulnerable to the entry of tree roots which can eventually cause the system to fail.

== Regulations ==
Modern environmental regulations either discourage or ban the use of cesspools, and instead connections to municipal [[Sanitary sewer|sewage systems]] or [[septic tank]]s are encouraged or required.

In many countries, planning and development regulations for the protection of the watershed prevent home-owners who live close to rivers and environmentally sensitive areas from installing a [[septic system]], requiring a holding tank instead.

=== United States ===
In some localities in the U.S., existing rural residential waste cesspools are "[[Grandfather clause|grandfathered]]" or allowed to continue operations until they no longer function. Once defunct, they must be disconnected and replaced by modern septic systems. In areas that have a higher than usual [[water table]] or fail a [[percolation test]], an above-ground drain field waste disposal system may be installed instead.

In the case of sale or transfer of residential property that uses an existing waste cesspool system, local laws may differ. Some counties or jurisdictions do not permit the sale of residential property that utilizes a waste cesspool. Other counties or villages may recognize the "grandfather clause" and allow the property sale or transfer.

=== Europe ===
In France, Germany, Spain and Switzerland, cesspits are forbidden.

== History ==
{{seealso|History of water supply and sanitation}}
===United States===
The typical American urbanite in the 1870s relied on the rural solution of individual well and outhouse (privy) or cesspools. Baltimore in the 1880s smelled "like a billion [[polecat]]s," according to [[H. L. Mencken]], and a [[Chicago]]an said in his city "the stink is enough to knock you down." Improvement was slow, and large cities of the East and South depended to the end of the century mainly on drainage through open gutters. Pollution of water supplies by [[sewage]] as well as dumping of [[industrial waste]] accounted in large measures for the public health records and staggering mortality rates of the period.{{Citation needed|date=October 2017}} &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The National Experience}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Europe ===
Cesspits were introduced to Europe in the 16th century, at a time when urban populations were growing at a faster rate than in the past. The added burden of waste volume began overloading urban street gutters, where [[chamber pot]]s were emptied each day. There was no regulation of cesspit construction until the 18th century, when a need to address sanitation and safety concerns became apparent. Cesspits were cleaned out by tradesmen using shovels and horse-drawn wagons. Cesspools were cleaned only at night, to reduce the smell and annoyance to the public. The typical cesspit was cleaned out once every 8 to 10 years. Fermentation of the solid waste collecting in cesspits, however, resulted in dangerous infections and gases that sometimes asphyxiated cesspit cleaners. Cesspits began to be cleaned out more regularly, but strict regulations for cesspit construction and ventilation were not introduced until the 1800s.&lt;ref name="La Berge 2002 207–9"&gt;{{cite book|last=La Berge|first=Ann Elizabeth Fowler|title=Mission and Method: The Early Nineteenth-Century French Public Health Movement|year=2002|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=9780521527019|pages=207–9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Before construction reforms were introduced in the early 19th century, liquid waste would seep away through the ground, leaving solid waste behind in the cesspit. While this made removal of solid waste easier, the seeping liquid waste often contaminated well water sources, creating public health problems. Municipal reforms required that cesspits be built of solid walls of stone and concrete. This kept liquid waste in the cesspit, forcing cesspits to be cleaned more frequently, on average two or three times per year. Liquid cesspit waste would be removed with pumps by cesspit cleaners, and then solid waste, valuable as fertilizer and for manufacturing [[ammonia]], was removed.&lt;ref name="La Berge 2002 207–9" /&gt; 
 
In 1846, French public hygienist [[Alphone Guérard]] estimated that 100 cesspits were cleaned in Paris every night, by 200-250 total cesspit cleaners in the city, and out of a total of 30,000 cesspits. The replacement of Paris' cesspit system was challenged for decades by officials not on public hygiene grounds, but on economic ones, based on the desire to conserve human waste as fertilizer rather than disposing of it in a modern sewer system. Paris' sewer system began modernizing in the 1880s, with the conversion of storm sewers for public sewage. Some cesspits were still in use in Paris into the 20th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=La Berge|first=Ann Elizabeth Fowler|title=Mission and Method: The Early Nineteenth-Century French Public Health Movement|year=2002|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=9780521527019|pages=209, 215}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Suffolk County, on Long Island, [[New York (state)|New York]], most households still use cesspools for waste drainage.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Shovel Ready|date=2011-01-24|url=http://www.johnderbyshire.com/Opinions/Straggler/098.html|author=[[John Derbyshire]]|journal=[[National Review]]|volume=63|issue=1|page=55|issn=0028-0038|department=The Straggler}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Cesspool collapses have occurred in this area, for example on December 8, 2009. Two workers in a decommissioned cesspit were trapped, subsequently leading to a two-hour rescue mission. Since 1998, six cases of cesspools collapsing and sucking in human residents that were standing over them have been reported, injuring a total of seven people, killing one in 2001,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,192807,00.html|title=Man, Son, Neighbor Sucked Into N.Y.

These structures weakened over their lifespan leading to increased risk of collapse. Newer cesspools are [[Precast concrete|cast concrete]] which dramatically decrease any risk of collapse. All new construction in areas without waste sewer systems use these new precast cesspools. In addition, cast concrete cesspools are used commonly in commercial construction for storm water collection.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1914">'''Chemokinesis''' is [[chemical substance|chemically]] prompted [[kinesis (biology)|kinesis]], a motile response of unicellular [[prokaryotic]] or [[eukaryotic]] organisms to chemicals that cause the cell to make some kind of change in their migratory/swimming behaviour. Changes involve an increase or decrease of speed, alterations of amplitude or frequency of motile character, or direction of migration. However, in contrast to [[chemotaxis]], chemokinesis has a random, non-vectorial moiety, in general.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author= Becker EL

&lt;br /&gt;
Due to the random character, techniques dedicated to evaluate chemokinesis are partly different from methods used in chemotaxis research. One of the most valuable ways to measure chemokinesis is computer-assisted (see, e.g., [[Image J]]) checker-board analysis, which provides data about migration of identical cells, whereas, in Protozoa (e.g., Tetrahymena), techniques  based on measurement of opalescence were also developed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi= 10.1002/bies.950140113 | author= Leick V, Hellung-Larsen P.

{{wiktionary|chip on one's shoulder}}
To have a '''chip on one's shoulder''' refers to the act of holding a [[wikt:grudge|grudge]] or [[grievance]] that readily provokes disputation.

It can also mean a person thinking too much of oneself (often without the [[credentials]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Korach|first1=Myron|title=Common Phrases: And Where They Come From|date=1 September 2002|publisher=The Lyon Press|location=New York|isbn=1585746827}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
[[File:Don't try to knock a chip from Riley's shoulder (NYPL Hades-464072-1165846).jpg|thumb|right|200px|Cover of sheet music for the song titled: "''Don't Try to Knock a Chip from Riley's Shoulder.''" (J. W. Wheeler) which alludes to the expression,]]
"A chip on the shoulder" comes from the ancient right of [[shipwrights]] within the [[Royal Navy Dockyard]]s to take home a daily allowance of offcuts of [[timber]], even if good wood was cut up for this purpose. The privilege was instated as a prescriptive right from 1634.&lt;ref name = linebaugh-2003/&gt;&lt;ref name = lunn&amp;day-1999/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Richardson, H.E., 'Wages of Shipwrights in H.M. Dockyards, 1496-1788', Mariner's Mirror, Vol. 33 (1947), p.266.&lt;/ref&gt; By 1756, this privilege had been abused and was costing taxpayers too much in lost timber for warship repair and construction. The decision was then made by the [[Navy Board]] to limit the quantity a shipwright could carry home. A warrant was issued to the Royal Dockyards to reduce the quantity of chips by ordering shipwrights to carry their bundles under their arms instead of on their shoulders, as one could not carry as much timber in this fashion. The specific incident from which the expression derives is as follows:

{{cquote|Master Shipwright and his Assistant, [[Chatham Dockyard]], to Navy Board, 17 June 1756.

On Tuesday a petition was brought to the Honourable Thomas Cooper, Esq., Commissioner of this yard, by John Bissenden and Robert Woodriff, shipwrights, in behalf of the whole body of shipwrights, relating to their carrying chips out of the yard on their shoulders. The next day the Commissioner sent for them in the presence of the Master Shipwright and the First Assistant and represented to them the ill consequence of such proceedings, and read to them your Honourable Board's warrant of the 4 May 1753 on which the said two men withdrew the petition and said they would talk to all the people and believe everybody would be satisfied with what had been said to them. And in the afternoon the Master Shipwright sent for all the foremen and quartermen and read the Order to them of the 4th May 1753, and give every quarterman a particular charge to tell all his men separately what the order was relating to their lowering their chips and carrying them under their arm out of the yard.

This day at twelve of the clock some few of the workmen about one hundred and fifty came up first to the gate without any chips, afterwards about twenty more came and lowered their chips agreeable to the Board's warrant. Then came John Miller, shipwright, about thirty feet before the main body of the people, on which the Master Shipwright ordered him to lower his chips. He answered he would not, with that the Master Shipwright took hold of him, and said he should. He, the said Miller replied, 'Are not the chips mine? I will not lower them.' Immediately the main body pushed on with their chips on their shoulders, crowded and forced the Master Shipwright and the First Assistant through the gateway, and when out of the yard give three huzzas.&lt;ref&gt;National Maritime Museum, Greenwich, London, ADM/B/153: Admiralty In-Letters, transcribed in Hattendorf, J.B. et al., ''British Naval Documents'' (London, Naval Records Society, 1993), pp. 528-529&lt;/ref&gt;}}
[[File:They knocked the chip off Uncle Sam's shoulder^ So let's go productioneer... Let's show `em some chips^ - NARA - 534974.jpg|thumb|right|200px|An American wartime poster alluding to the expression.]]
This custom{{clarify|date=March 2017}} is known in North America since the early 19th century. The [[New York City|New York]] newspaper ''Long Island Telegraph'' reported on 20 May 1830 "when two churlish boys were determined to fight, a chip would be placed on the shoulder of one, and the other demanded to knock it off at his peril". A similar notion is mentioned in the issue of the ''Onondaga Standard'' of [[Syracuse, New York|Syracuse]], [[New York (state)|New York]] on 8 December 1830: "'He waylay me', said I, 'the mean sneaking fellow—I am only afraid that he will sue me for damages. Oh! if I only could get him to knock a chip off my shoulder, and so get round the law, I would give him one of the soundest thrashings he ever had'." Some time later in 1855, the phrase "chip on his shoulder" appeared in the ''Weekly Oregonian'', stating "Leland, in his last issue, struts out with a chip on his shoulder, and dares Bush to knock it off". In American author [[Mark Twain]]'s 1898 manuscript of ''[[Schoolhouse Hill]]'', character [[Tom Sawyer]] states his knowledge of the phrase and custom when he says, "[I]f you want your fuss, and can't wait till recess, which is regular, go at it right and fair; put a chip on your shoulder and dare him to knock it off."&lt;ref&gt;William M. Gibson, ed., Mark Twain's Mysterious Stranger Manuscripts (Berkeley and Los Angeles: University of California Press, 1969), p.177.&lt;/ref&gt;

In Canada, the custom is well described at St. Peter Claver's Indian Residential School for [[Ojibway]] boys in the town of [[Spanish, Ontario]]:

{{cquote|By custom, the challenger, usually one of the intermediates, anxious to prove his worth or avenge some wrong, would deliberately seek out his foe with a wood chip or flat stone on his shoulder, placed there either by his own hand or by that of somebody else.}}
The challenger might further provoke his opponent by issuing a [[:wikt:dare|dare]] for him to knock off the chip. The opponent might then display his bravery and contempt by brushing the cheek of the challenger lightly as he did so. In more formal cases, a [[duel|second]] might take the chip and present the chip to his man who would then place it on his own shoulder. The boys would then square off and [[fistfight]] like boxers.&lt;ref name="Johnston"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Johnston|first1=Basil H.|authorlink1=Basil H.

A '''counterfactual conditional''' ([[list of glossing abbreviations|abbreviated]] {{Sc|'''cf'''}}), is a conditional containing an if-clause which is contrary to fact. The term "counterfactual conditional" was coined by [[Nelson Goodman]] in 1947,&lt;ref&gt;Goodman, N., "The Problem of Counterfactual Conditionals", ''The Journal of Philosophy'', Vol. 44, No. 5, (27 February 1947), pp. 113–28.&lt;/ref&gt; extending [[Roderick Chisholm]]'s (1946) notion of a "'''contrary-to-fact conditional'''&lt;!--boldface per WP:R#PLA--&gt;".&lt;ref&gt;Chisholm, R.M., "The Contrary-to-Fact Conditional", ''Mind'', Vol. 55, No. 220, (October 1946), pp. 289–307.&lt;/ref&gt; The study of counterfactual speculation has increasingly engaged the interest of scholars in a wide range of domains such as philosophy,&lt;ref&gt;Goodman, N., "The Problem of Counterfactual Conditionals", ''The Journal of Philosophy'', Vol. 44, No. 5, (27 February 1947), pp. 113–28; Brown, R, &amp; Watling, J., "Counterfactual Conditionals", ''Mind'', Vol. 61, No. 242, (April 1952), pp. 222–33; Parry, W.T., "Reëxamination of the Problem of Counterfactual Conditionals", ''The Journal of Philosophy'', Vol. 54, No. 4, (14 February 1957), pp. 85–94; Cooley, J.C., "Professor Goodman’s ''Fact, Fiction, &amp; Forecast''", ''The Journal of Philosophy'', Vol. 54, No. 10, (9 May 1957), pp. 293–311; Goodman, N., "Parry on Counterfactuals", ''The Journal of Philosophy'', Vol. 54, No. 14, (4 July 1957), pp. 442–45; Goodman, N., "Reply to an Adverse Ally", ''The Journal of Philosophy'', Vol. 54, No. 17, (15 August 1957), pp. 531–35; [[David Lewis (philosopher)|Lewis, D.]], Counterfactuals, Basil Blackwell, (Oxford), 1973, etc.&lt;/ref&gt; human geography, psychology,&lt;ref&gt;Fillenbaum, S., "Information Amplified: Memory for Counterfactual Conditionals", ''Journal of Experimental Psychology'', Vol. 102, No. 1, (January 1974), pp. 44–49; Crawford, M.T. &amp; McCrea, S.M., "When Mutations meet Motivations: Attitude Biases in Counterfactual Thought", ''Journal of Experimental Social Psychology'', Vol. 40, No. 1, (January 2004), pp. 65–74, etc.&lt;/ref&gt; cognitive psychology,&lt;ref&gt;Kahneman, D. &amp; Tversky, A., "The Simulation Heuristic", pp. 201–08 in Kahneman, D., Slovic, p.  &amp; Tversky, A.

In 1748, when defining causation, [[David Hume]] referred to a counterfactual case:
{{quotation|"… we may define a cause to be an ''object, followed by another, and where all objects, similar to the first, are followed by objects similar to the second''. Or in other words, ''where, if the first object had not been, the second never had existed'' …" — David Hume, ''An Enquiry Concerning Human Understanding''.&lt;ref&gt;Hume, D. (Beauchamp, T.L., ed.), ''An Enquiry Concerning Human Understanding'', Oxford University Press, (Oxford), 1999, (7), p. 146: emphasis in the original).&lt;/ref&gt;}}

'''Counterfactualism'''&lt;!--boldface per WP:R#PLA--&gt; is the view that [[disposition]]s are a type of counterfactual property.&lt;ref&gt;David Stewart Blanks, [https://etd.ohiolink.edu/!etd.send_file?accession=osu1440118716&amp;disposition=inline ''The Metaphysics of Dispositions: A Case for Counterfactualism''], Ph.D. thesis, Ohio State University, 2015, p. 1.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Examples ==

The difference between [[indicative conditional|indicative]] and counterfactual conditionals, in a context of past time reference, is one of emphasis. This can be illustrated with a pair of examples in which the ''if'' clause is in the past indicative in the first example but in the pluperfect subjunctive in the second:
* ''If [[Lee Harvey Oswald|Oswald]] '''did not shoot''' [[John F. Kennedy|Kennedy]], then someone else '''did'''.''
* ''If Oswald '''had not shot''' Kennedy, then someone else '''would have'''.''

The [[Protasis (linguistics)|protasis]] (the ''if'' clause) of the first sentence may or may not be true according to the speaker, so the [[Conditional sentence|apodosis]] (the ''then'' clause) also may or may not be true; the apodosis is asserted by the speaker to be true if the protasis is true. In this sentence the ''if'' clause and the ''then'' clause are both in the past tense of the [[indicative mood]].

In the second sentence, the speaker is speaking with a certainty that Oswald ''did'' shoot Kennedy. According to the speaker, the ''if'' clause is false, so the ''then'' clause deals with the counterfactual result, i.e., what would have happened. In this sentence the ''if'' clause is in the [[English subjunctive#Pluperfect subjunctive|pluperfect subjunctive]] form of the [[subjunctive mood]], and the ''then'' clause is in the [[conditional perfect]] form of the [[conditional mood]].

A corresponding pair of examples with present time reference uses the present indicative in the ''if'' clause of the first sentence but the past subjunctive in the second sentence's ''if'' clause:
* ''If it '''is raining''', then he '''is''' inside. ''
* ''If it '''were raining''', then he '''would be''' inside.''

Here again, in the first sentence the ''if'' clause may or may not be true; the ''then'' clause may or may not be true but certainly (according to the speaker) is true conditional on the ''if'' clause being true. Here both the ''if'' clause and the ''then'' clause are in the present indicative. In the second sentence, the ''if'' clause is not true, while the ''then'' clause may or may not be true but certainly would be true in the counterfactual circumstance of the ''if'' clause being true. In this sentence, the ''if'' clause is in the [[English subjunctive#Use of the past subjunctive|past subjunctive]] form of the subjunctive mood, and the ''then'' clause is in the conditional mood.

==Reversal of clauses==

The use of the terms "antecedent" and "subsequent" is ambiguous. In logic, while "antecedent" usually means the if-clause, it might refer to whichever comes first.{{citation needed|date=February 2012}} Protasis and apodosis avoid the issue entirely.

==Psychology==

People engage in [[counterfactual thinking]] frequently. Experimental evidence indicates that people's thoughts about counterfactual conditionals differ in important ways from their thoughts about indicative conditionals.

===Comprehension===
Participants in experiments were asked to read sentences, including counterfactual conditionals, e.g., 'if Mark had left home early he would have caught the train'. Afterwards, they were asked to identify which sentences they had been shown. They often mistakenly believed they had been shown sentences corresponding to the presupposed facts, e.g., 'Mark did not leave home early' and 'Mark did not catch the train' (Fillenbaum, 1974). In other experiments, participants were asked to read short stories that contained counterfactual conditionals, e.g., 'if there had been roses in the flower shop then there would have been lilies'. Later in the story they read sentences corresponding to the presupposed facts, e.g., 'there were no roses and there were no lilies'. The counterfactual conditional 'primed' them to read the sentence corresponding to the presupposed facts very rapidly; no such priming effect occurred for indicative conditionals (Santamaria, Espino, and Byrne, 2005). They spend different amounts of time 'updating' a story that contains a counterfactual conditional compared to one that contains factual information (De Vega, Urrutia, and Riffo, 2007) and they focus on different parts of counterfactual conditionals (Ferguson and Sanford, 2008).

===Reasoning===
Experiments have compared the inferences people make from counterfactual conditionals and indicative conditionals. Given a counterfactual conditional, e.g., 'If there had been a circle on the blackboard then there would have been a triangle', and the subsequent information 'in fact there was no triangle', participants make the [[modus tollens]] inference 'there was no circle' more often than they do from an indicative conditional (Byrne and Tasso, 1999). Given the counterfactual conditional and the subsequent information 'in fact there was a circle', participants make the [[modus ponens]] inference as often as they do from an indicative conditional. See [[counterfactual thinking]].

===Psychological accounts===
[[Ruth M.J. Byrne]] proposed in [https://www.amazon.com/The-Rational-Imagination-Alternatives-Bradford/dp/0262025841 ''The Rational Imagination: How People Create Alternatives to Reality''] that people construct [[mental representation]]s that encompass two possibilities when they understand, and reason from, a counterfactual conditional, e.g., 'if Oswald had not shot Kennedy, then someone else would have'. They envisage the conjecture 'Oswald did not shoot Kennedy and someone else did' and they also think about the presupposed facts 'Oswald did shoot Kennedy and someone else did not' (Byrne, 2005). According to the [[mental model theory of reasoning]], they construct [[mental models]] of the alternative possibilities, as described in [https://books.google.com/books/about/Deduction.html?id=ZQPFQgAACAAJ&amp;redir_esc=y ''Deduction''] (Johnson-Laird and Byrne, 1991).

==Philosophical treatments==
=== Connective ===
In order to distinguish counterfactual conditionals from [[material conditional]]s, a new logical connective '&gt;' is defined, where ''A'' &gt; ''B'' can be interpreted as "If it were the case that ''A'', then it would be the case that ''B''."

The [[truth value]] of a material conditional, ''A'' → ''B'', is determined by the truth values of ''A'' and ''B''. This is not so for the counterfactual conditional ''A'' &gt; ''B'', for there are different situations agreeing on the truth values of A and B but which yield different evaluations of ''A'' &gt; ''B''. For example, if Keith is in [[Germany]], the following two conditionals have both a false antecedent and a false consequent:

# if Keith were in [[Mexico]] then he would be in [[Africa]].
# if Keith were in Mexico then he would be in [[North America]].

Indeed, if Keith is in Germany, then all three conditions "Keith is in Mexico", "Keith is in Africa", and "Keith is in North America" are false. However, (1) is obviously false, while (2) is true as [[Mexico]] is part of [[North America]].

=== Possible world semantics ===
Philosophers such as [[David Kellogg Lewis|David Lewis]] and [[Robert Stalnaker]] modeled counterfactuals using the [[possible world semantics]] of [[modal logic]]. The semantics of a conditional ''A'' &gt; ''B'' are given by some function on the relative closeness of worlds where A is true and B is true, on the one hand, and worlds where A is true but B is not, on the other.

On Lewis's account, A &gt; C is (a) vacuously true if and only if there are no worlds where A is true (for example, if A is logically or metaphysically impossible); (b) non-vacuously true if and only if, among the worlds where A is true, some worlds where C is true are closer to the actual world than any world where C is not true; or (c) false otherwise. Although in Lewis's ''Counterfactuals'' it was unclear what he meant by 'closeness', in later writings, Lewis made it clear that he did ''not'' intend the metric of 'closeness' to be simply our ordinary notion of overall similarity.

Example:
:If he had eaten more at breakfast, he would not have been hungry at 11 am.
On Lewis's account, the truth of this statement consists in the fact that, among possible worlds where he ate more for breakfast, there is at least one world where he is not hungry at 11 am and which is closer to our world than any world where he ate more for breakfast but is still hungry at 11 am.

Stalnaker's account differs from Lewis's most notably in his acceptance of the ''limit'' and ''uniqueness assumptions''. The uniqueness assumption is the thesis that, for any antecedent A, there is a unique possible world where A is true, while the limit assumption is the thesis that, for a given antecedent A, there is a unique set of worlds where A is true that are closest. (The uniqueness assumption [[logical consequence|entails]] the limit assumption, but the limit assumption does not entail the uniqueness assumption.) On Stalnaker's account, A &gt; C is non-vacuously true if and only if, at the closest world where A is true, C is true. So, the above example is true just in case at the single, closest world where he ate more breakfast, he does not feel hungry at 11 am. Although it is controversial, Lewis rejected the limit assumption (and therefore the uniqueness assumption) because it rules out the possibility that there might be worlds that get closer and closer to the actual world without limit. For example, there might be an infinite series of worlds, each with a coffee cup a smaller fraction of an inch to the left of its actual position, but none of which is uniquely the closest. (See Lewis 1973: 20.)

One consequence of Stalnaker's acceptance of the uniqueness assumption is that, if the [[law of excluded middle]] is true, then all instances of the formula (A &gt; C) ∨ (A &gt; ¬C) are true. The law of excluded middle is the thesis that for all propositions p, p ∨ ¬p is true. If the uniqueness assumption is true, then for every antecedent A, there is a uniquely closest world where A is true. If the law of excluded middle is true, any consequent C is either true or false at that world where A is true. So for every counterfactual A &gt; C, either A &gt; C or A &gt; ¬C is true. This is called conditional excluded middle (CEM). Example:

:(1) If the fair coin had been flipped, it would have landed heads.
:(2) If the fair coin had been flipped, it would have landed tails (i.e. not heads).
On Stalnaker's analysis, there is a closest world where the fair coin mentioned in (1) and (2) is flipped and at that world either it lands heads or it lands tails. So either (1) is true and (2) is false or (1) is false and (2) true. On Lewis's analysis, however, both (1) and (2) are false, for the worlds where the fair coin lands heads are no more or less close than the worlds where they land tails. For Lewis, "If the coin had been flipped, it would have landed heads or tails" is true, but this does not entail that "If the coin had been flipped, it would have landed heads, or: If the coin had been flipped it would have landed tails."

=== Other accounts ===
====Ramsey====
Counterfactual conditionals may also be evaluated using the so-called [[Belief revision#The Ramsey test|Ramsey test]]: ''A'' &gt; ''B'' holds if and only if the addition of ''A'' to the current body of knowledge has ''B'' as a consequence. This condition relates counterfactual conditionals to [[belief revision]], as the evaluation of ''A'' &gt; ''B'' can be done by first revising the current knowledge with ''A'' and then checking whether ''B'' is true in what results.  Revising is easy when ''A'' is consistent with the current beliefs, but can be hard otherwise. Every semantics for belief revision can be used for evaluating conditional statements.  Conversely, every method for evaluating conditionals can be seen as a way for performing revision.

====Ginsberg====
Ginsberg (1986) has proposed a semantics for conditionals which assumes that the current beliefs form a set of [[propositional formula]]e, considering the maximal sets of these formulae that are consistent with ''A'', and adding ''A'' to each. The rationale is that each of these maximal sets represents a possible state of belief in which ''A'' is true that is as similar as possible to the original one. The conditional statement ''A'' &gt; ''B'' therefore holds if and only if ''B'' is true in all such sets. &lt;ref name="rev. no. 03011"&gt;{{citation | title = Review of the paper: M. L. Ginsberg, "Counterfactuals," Artificial Intelligence 30 (1986), pp. 35–79 | pages = 13–14 | publisher = FIZ Karlsruhe – Leibniz Institute for Information Infrastructure GmbH | journal = Zentralblatt für Mathematik | zbl=0655.03011 | year = 1989 | url = https://zbmath.org/?q=an:0655.03011&amp;format=complete}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Within empirical testing===
The counterfactual conditional is the basis of experimental methods for establishing [[causality]] in the natural and social sciences, e.g., whether taking antibiotics helps cure bacterial infection. For every individual, ''u'', there is a function that specifies the state of ''u'''s infection under two hypothetical conditions: had ''u'' taken antibiotic and had ''u'' not taken antibiotic. Only one of these states can be observed in any instance, since they are mutually exclusive. The overall effect of antibiotic on infection is defined as the difference between these two states, averaged over the entire population. If the treatment and control groups are selected at random, the effect of antibiotic can be estimated by comparing the rates of recovery in the two groups.

====Pearl====
The tight connection between causal and counterfactual relations has prompted [[Judea Pearl]] (2000) to reject both the possible world semantics and those of Ramsey and Ginsberg. The latter was rejected because causal information cannot be encoded as a set of beliefs, and the former because it is difficult to fine-tune Lewis's similarity measure to match causal intuition. Pearl defines counterfactuals directly in terms of a "[[structural equation model]]" –  a set of equations, in which each variable is assigned a value that is an explicit function of other variables in the system. Given such a model, the sentence "''Y'' would be ''y'' had ''X'' been ''x''" (formally, ''X = x'' &gt; ''Y = y'' ) is defined as the assertion: If we replace the equation currently determining ''X'' with a constant ''X = x'', and solve the set of equations for variable ''Y'', the solution obtained will be ''Y = y''. This definition has been shown to be compatible with the axioms of possible world semantics and forms the basis for causal inference in the natural and social sciences, since each structural equation in those domains corresponds to a familiar causal mechanism that can be meaningfully reasoned about by investigators.

Her work as a scholar practitioner has furthered both research and practice in the fields of appreciative leadership and positive organization development. She was awarded [[Vallarta Institute]]’s Annual 2X2 (Two by Two) Recreate the World Award.&lt;ref name=Vallarta&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vallartainstitute.com/award.php |title=2X2 Recreate The World Award |publisher=The Vallarta Institute |date= |accessdate=2013-11-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Whitney earned her PhD from [[Temple University]]. She currently teaches and advises students in the capacity of distinguished consulting faculty at [[Saybrook University]] and as faculty advisor for the Taos Tilburg PhD Program.

==Social innovations==
In 1991 Whitney along with [[Kenneth Gergen]], [[Mary Gergen]], Sheila McNamme, [[Harlene Anderson]], [[David Cooperrider]] and Suresh Srivastva founded the [[Taos Institute]] as a community of scholars and practitioners dedicated to furthering relational practices in the fields of organization development, family therapy and education.&lt;ref name=TI/&gt;  There are now over 250 associates around the world.

From 1995 until 2009 Whitney served as an advisor and facilitator in the design and development of the United Religions Initiative, a global inter-faith organization dedicated to peace. It was for this purpose that Whitney and David Cooperrider created the processes that Whitney entitled the Appreciative Inquiry Summit.

Whitney worked with [[Case Western Reserve University]]  Weatherhead School of Management faculty [[David Cooperrider]] and Ron Fry to assess the need for and design the first Master’s of positive organization development program.

==Research==
In her 1980 dissertation, funded by the [[National Institute of Education]], Whitney studied and mapped the processes used for the dissemination of educational innovations. Her relational consultative model of the work of dissemination linking agents was implemented in educational R&amp;D laboratories across the country.

Whitney’s most recent research, conducted in partnership with Kae Rader and AmandaTrosten-Bloom, focuses on leadership and positive power. Through a qualitative research process employing one-on-one interviews and focus groups, they discovered and subsequently confirmed five factors related to appreciative leadership: inquiry, inclusion, illumination, inspiration and integrity. The results are published in their book, ''Appreciative Leadership: Focus on What Works to Drive Winning Performance and Build a Thriving Organization''.

In partnership with Jeff Jackson and Maurice Monette of the Vallarta Institute and funded by a grant from the Reynolds Foundation, Whitney is currently engaged in research on the impact of appreciative inquiry in Cuba.

      <comment>I fixed what I believe is a typo, I believe it was meant that "H splits topologically from G" not that "H splits topologically form G". I also changed the mapping of the cartesian product of H sub 1 with itself to H sub 1 and H sub 2.</comment>

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2327">In [[mathematics]], a [[topological group]] ''G'' is called the '''topological direct sum'''&lt;ref&gt;E. Hewitt and K. A. Ross, Abstract harmonic analysis. Vol. I, second edition, Grundlehren der Mathematischen Wissenschaften, 115, Springer, Berlin, 1979. MR0551496 (81k:43001)&lt;/ref&gt; of two [[subgroup]]s ''H''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and ''H''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; if
the map
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
H_1\times H_2 &amp;\longrightarrow G \\
(h_1,h_2)     &amp;\longmapsto     h_1 h_2
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;
is a topological isomorphism.

More generally, ''G'' is called the direct sum of a finite set of [[subgroup]]s  &lt;math&gt;H_i, i=1,\ldots, n&lt;/math&gt; of the map
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
\prod^n_{i=1} H_i&amp;\longrightarrow G \\
(h_i)_{i\in I}    &amp;\longmapsto     h_1 h_2 \cdots h_n
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

Note that if a topological group ''G'' is the topological direct sum of the family of subgroups &lt;math&gt;H_i &lt;/math&gt; then in particular, as an abstract group (without topology) it is also the [[Direct sum of groups|direct sum]] (in the usual way) of the family &lt;math&gt;H_i &lt;/math&gt;.

==Topological direct summands==
Given a topological group ''G'', we say that a subgroup ''H'' is a '''topological direct summand''' of ''G'' (or that '''splits topologically''' from ''G'') if and only if there exist another subgroup ''K''&amp;nbsp;≤&amp;nbsp;''G'' such that ''G'' is the direct sum of the subgroups ''H'' and ''K''.

A the subgroup ''H'' is a topological direct summand if and only if the [[Extension of a topological group|extension of topological groups]]

:&lt;math&gt;0 \to H\stackrel{i}{{} \to {}} G\stackrel{\pi}{{} \to {}} G/H\to 0&lt;/math&gt;

splits, where &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt; is the natural inclusion and &lt;math&gt;\pi&lt;/math&gt; is the natural projection.

==Examples==

*Suppose that &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; is a [[Locally compact group|locally compact abelian group]] that contains the [[unit circle]] &lt;math&gt;\mathbb T&lt;/math&gt; as a subgroup. Then &lt;math&gt;\mathbb T&lt;/math&gt; is a topological direct summand of ''G''. The same assertion is true for the [[real numbers]] &lt;math&gt;\mathbb R&lt;/math&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Armacost, David L. The structure of locally compact abelian groups. Monographs and Textbooks in Pure and Applied Mathematics, 68.

== Background ==

Esra'a Al Shafei, according to her own account, recalls witnessing inhumane treatment of migrant workers as a child. This, along with stereotypical media portrayals of middle eastern youth, prompted her to found the Mideast Youth network.&lt;ref name="Gulli"&gt;{{cite news |url = http://www.simoncolumbus.com/2009/07/19/interview-with-esraa-al-shafei-on-freedom-of-expression-in-the-middle-east/ |title = Interview with Esra’a Al Shafei on freedom of expression in the Middle East |author = Simon Columbus |agency = Gulli |date = 19 July 2009 |accessdate = 28 April 2011 |deadurl = no |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20111009132000/http://www.simoncolumbus.com/2009/07/19/interview-with-esraa-al-shafei-on-freedom-of-expression-in-the-middle-east/ |archivedate = 9 October 2011 |df = dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Over time, the network expanded to include other civil rights issues within the Middle East, and branched out to create a diverse range of platforms with a global reach.

{{quote|quote=We want our humanity and our futures in our own hands and we use the internet and other forms of technology to fight for those rights&lt;ref name="Gulli" /&gt;|author=Esra'a Al Shafei}}

{{quote|quote=&lt;poem&gt;The consequences of attending a metal or rock event is a topic of discussion that's frequently raised on Mideast Youth.

It isn't just young people but professionals who don't want to put their jobs on the line who are worried. Women, in particular, express concern about harming their reputation.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4110">'''Francis Polkinghorne Pascoe''' (1 September 1813 – 20 June 1893) was an English [[Entomology|entomologist]] mainly interested in Coleoptera, commonly known as [[beetle]]s.

==Biography==
He was born in [[Penzance]], Cornwall and trained at [[St. Bartholomew's Hospital]], London. Appointed surgeon in the [[Royal Navy|Navy]] he served on Australian, [[West Indies|West Indian]] and [[Mediterranean]] stations. He married a Miss Mary Glasson of [[Cornwall]] and settled at [[Trewhiddle]] near [[St Austell]] where his wife's property produced [[china clay]]. Widowed in 1851 he settled in London devoting himself to [[natural history]] and [[entomology]] in particular. The results of collecting trips to Europe, North Africa and the [[Amazon Rainforest|Lower Amazons]] were poor and Pascoe worked mainly on insects collected by others.

'''The Future wheel''' is a method for graphical [[visualization (graphic)|visualisation]] of direct and indirect [[future]] '''consequences''' of a particular change or development. It was invented by [[Jerome C. Glenn]] in 1971, when he was a [[student]] at the Antioch Graduate School of Education (now [[Antioch University New England]]).
&lt;blockquote&gt;The Futures Wheel is a way of organizing thinking and questioning about the future – a kind of structured brainstorming. (Jerome C. Glenn (1994) The Futures Wheel)&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Description==

To start a Futures wheel the central [[terminology|term]] describing the change to evaluate is positioned in the center of the page (or drawing area). Then, events or consequences following directly from that development are positioned around it. Next, the (indirect) consequences of the direct consequences are positioned around the first level consequences. The terms may be connected as nodes in a tree (or even a web). The levels will often be marked by concentric circles.

==Usage==

The Futures wheel is usually used to organize [[thought]]s about a future development or trend. With it, possible impacts can be collected and put down in a structured way. The use of interconnecting lines makes it possible to visualize interrelationships of the causes and resulting changes. Thus, Futures wheels can assist in developing multi-concepts about possible future development by offering a futures-conscious perspective and aiding in group [[brainstorming]].

'''Gay bashing''' and '''gay bullying''' is [[verbal abuse|verbal]] or [[physical abuse]] against a person who is perceived by the aggressor to be  [[gay]], [[lesbian]], [[bisexual]], [[transgender]], including persons who identify as  [[heterosexual]].

A "[[Bashing (pejorative)|bashing]]" may be a specific incident, and one could also use the verb ''to bash'' (e.g. "I was gay bashed."). A verbal gay bashing might use sexual slurs, expletives, [[intimidation]], and threatened or actual violence. It also might take place in a political forum and include one or more common [[anti-gay slogan]]s.

Gay bullying involves intentional and unprovoked actions toward the victim, repeated negative actions by one or more people against another person, and an imbalance of physical or psychological power.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |publisher=US Dept of Education |title=Bullying Myths and Facts |accessdate=October 2, 2010 |url=http://www2.ed.gov/admins/lead/safety/training/bullying/bullying_pg3.html |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100325204905/http://www2.ed.gov/admins/lead/safety/training/bullying/bullying_pg3.html |archivedate=March 25, 2010 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Similar terms such as ''lesbian bullying'', ''[[queer]] bullying'', and ''queer bashing'' may also be formed.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.rutgersuniversitypress.org/violence-against-queer-people/9780813573151|title=Violence against Queer People|last=Meyer|first=Doug|publisher=Rutgers University Press|year=2015|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Expand section|date=December 2010}}

Gay bashing has occurred worldwide for many decades and continues today.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Thomas|last=Rogers|url=http://www.salon.com/2010/12/12/lgbt_bullying_interview/|title=Explaining American schools' gay bullying epidemic|publisher=Salon.com|accessdate=December 12, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Homophobia in the United States]] was especially serious in the late 1940s and early 1950s, when many gay people were forced out of government by boards set up by Presidents [[Harry S. Truman]] and [[Dwight D. Eisenhower]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Sears|first1=Brad|last2=Hunter|first2=Nan D.|last3=Mallory|first3=Christy|title=Documenting Discrimination on the Basis of Sexual Orientation and Gender Identity in State Employment|date=September 2009|publisher=The Williams Institute on Sexual Orientation and Gender Identity Law and Public Policy at UCLA School of Law|location=Los Angeles|page=5–3|url=https://williamsinstitute.law.ucla.edu/wp-content/uploads/5_History.pdf#page=3|quote=From 1947 to 1961, more than 5,000 allegedly homosexual federal civil servants lost their jobs in the purges for no reason other than sexual orientation, and thousands of applicants were also rejected for federal employment for the same reason. During this period, more than 1,000 men and women were fired for suspected homosexuality from the State Department alone—a far greater number than were dismissed for their membership in the Communist party. The Cold War and anti-communist efforts provided the setting in which a sustained attack upon gay men and lesbians took place. The history of this 'Lavender Scare' by the federal government has been extensively documented by historian David Johnson. Johnson has demonstrated that during this era government officials intentionally engaged in campaigns to associate homosexuality with Communism: 'homosexual' and 'pervert' became synonyms for 'Communist' and 'traitor.' LGBT people were treated as a national security threat, demanding the attention of Congress, the courts, statehouses, and the media.}}&lt;/ref&gt; As historian [[David K. Johnson]] explains:&lt;ref name="uchicago"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.press.uchicago.edu/Misc/Chicago/404811in.html|publisher=University of Chicago Press|title=An interview with David K. Johnson}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|The [[Lavender Scare]] helped fan the flames of the [[Red Scare]]. In popular discourse, [[communist]]s and homosexuals were often conflated. Both groups were perceived as hidden [[subculture]]s with their own meeting places, literature, cultural codes, and bonds of loyalty. Both groups were thought to recruit to their ranks the psychologically weak or disturbed. And both groups were considered immoral and godless. Many people believed that the two groups were working together to undermine the government.}}

Johnson concludes that Senator [[Joe McCarthy]], notorious for his attacks on alleged communists in government, was often pressured by his allies to denounce homosexuals in government, but he resisted and did not do so.&lt;ref name="uchicago" /&gt; Using rumors collected by [[Drew Pearson (journalist)|Drew Pearson]], one [[Nevada]] publisher wrote in 1952 that both McCarthy and his chief counsel, [[Roy Cohn]], were homosexuals.&lt;ref group="note"&gt;After McCarthy called him an ex-Communist, [[Hank Greenspun]] wrote: "It is common talk among homosexuals in [[Milwaukee]] who rendezvous in the White Horse Inn that Senator Joe McCarthy has often engaged in homosexual activities." [[Las Vegas Sun]], October 25, 1952. McCarthy later explained he meant to call Greenspun an ex-convict (which was true), rather than an ex-Communist (which was false).&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Washington Post]]'' editor [[Benjamin C. Bradlee]] said, "There was a lot of time spent investigating" these allegations, "although no one came close to proving it."  No reputable McCarthy biographer has accepted it as probable.&lt;ref group="note"&gt;The allegations are specifically rejected in Richard Rovere, ''Senator Joe McCarthy'' (1969), p. 68; see also Robert D. Dean, ''Imperial Brotherhood: Gender and the Making of Cold War Foreign Policy'' (2001) p. 149 (includes Bradlee quote); Kyle A. Cuordileone, ''Manhood and American Political Culture in the Cold War'' (2003), p. 94; Thomas Patrick Doherty, ''Cold War, Cool Medium: Television, McCarthyism, and American Culture,'' (2003), p. 228. Geoff Schumacher, ''Sun, Sin &amp; Suburbia: An Essential History of Modern Las Vegas'' (2004), p. 144, concludes, "Greenspun descended into mud-spewing rhetoric that would make the [[National Enquirer]] blanch." Knowing that McCarthy would not dare enter Nevada, where he would be served with a lawsuit for defaming Greenspun, Greenspun punished McCarthy with his own weapon of anonymous, scandalous accusations.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Queer bullying ===

[[Egale Canada]] conducted a survey of more than 3700 high school students in Canada between December 2007 and June 2009. The final report of the survey, "Every Class in Every School",&lt;ref&gt;[http://egale.ca/youth-and-safer-schools/every-class/ Every Class in Every School], Final Report on the First National Climate Survey on Homophobia, Biphobia, and Transphobia in Canadian Schools, Egale Canada&lt;/ref&gt; published in 2011, found that 70% of all students participating heard "that's so gay" daily at school, and 48% of respondents heard "faggot", "lezbo" and "dyke" daily. 58% or about 1400 of the 2400 heterosexual students participating in EGALE's survey found homophobic comments upsetting.
Further, EGALE found that students not directly affected by [[homophobia]], [[biphobia]] or [[transphobia]] were less aware of it. This finding relates to research done in the area of [[Empathy gap|empathy gaps for social pain]] which suggests that those not directly experiencing social pain (in this case, bullying) consistently underestimate its effects and thus may not adequately respond to the needs of one experiencing social pain.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Nordgren | first1 = L.

A research study of 78 eleven to fourteen-year-old boys conducted in twelve schools in London, England between 1998 and 1999&lt;ref name="Phoenix" /&gt; revealed that respondents who used the word "gay" to label another boy in a derogatory manner intended the word as "just a joke", "just a cuss" and not as a statement of one's perceived [[sexual orientation]].&lt;ref name="Smith" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Pascoe, C. J. (2007). Dude You're a Fag, Masculinity and Sexuality in High School. Berkeley &amp; Los Angeles, CA: University of California Press&lt;/ref&gt; American sociologist [[Michael Kimmel]] and American psychologist [[Gregory Herek]] write that [[masculinity]] is a renunciation of the feminine and that males shore up their sense of their masculinity by denigrating the feminine and ultimately the homosexual.&lt;ref&gt;Kimmel, M.

Gay and lesbian youth are more likely to report bullying.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Berlan, ED |author2=Corliss, HL |author3=Field, AE |title= Sexual Orientation and Bullying Among Adolescents in the Growing Up Today Study |journal= Journal of Adolescent Health |date=April 2010 |volume=46 |pages=366–71 | doi = 10.1016/j.jadohealth.2009.10.015 |pmid=20307826 |pmc=2844864 |issue=4|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; In one study, boys who were bullied with taunts of being gay suffered more bullying and more negative effects compared with boys who were bullied with other categories of taunting.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Swearer, SM |author2=Turner, RT |author3=Givens, JE |title="You're so gay!": Do different forms of bullying matter for adolescent males? |journal= School Psychology Review |year=2008 |volume=37}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Causes of queer bullying ==

Gay and lesbian youth can develop severe forms of depression and anxiety as they grow up. In fact, 71.4% of LGBT folk experience major depression disorder (MDD).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Sweet|first1=Matt|title=Depression and Anxiety in LGBT People: What You Need to Know|url=http://www.mattsweet.com/lgbt-anxiety-depression-guide.pdf|accessdate=July 18, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; For LGBT individuals, MDD can be caused by any of the following: self-esteem, pressure to conform, minority stress, coming out, family rejection, parenting, relationship formation, and violence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Sweet|first1=Matt|title=Depression and Anxiety in the LGBT People: What You Need to Know|url=http://www.mattsweet.com/lgbt-anxiety-depression-guide.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; Self-esteem and pressure to conform go hand in hand. When an LGBT individual is told what to look like and who to love, it puts a toll on their self-esteem. When people make comments about who they are, what they look like, who they love, etc. it begins to make them feel insecure. It makes them feel as though they aren't good enough the way they are. "Coming-out" is a terms that is used to describe when an LGBT individual makes it known that they are gay, lesbian, etc. Coming out is usually the first factor that will affect a person involved in the LGBT community because when they first discover who they really are, their instinct is to confide in their parents to help them through it (Markheim, Personal Interview). When they experience family rejection after coming out, they automatically feel unwanted and unloved. This can set them into a downward spiral of depression. Parenting and relationship formation are very closely related because usually, people feel more comfortable parenting with their significant other rather than alone, especially if they are involved in the LGBT community. Just recently, in March 2016, is became legal for LGBT parents to adopt in all 50 states.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|last1=Reilly|first1=Mollie|title=Same-Sex Couples Can Now Adopt Children in All 50 States|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/mississippi-same-sex-adoption_us_56fdb1a3e4b083f5c607567f|newspaper=Huffington Post|accessdate=July 18, 2017|date=April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Not being able to conceive their own child can already cause depression, but when they were denied the right to adopt, it caused even more pain. Minority stress is not the biggest of all the factors, but it doesn't make anybody feel better. Minority stress is defined as a stress experienced by LGBT individuals due to their sexual orientation/gender identity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Meyer|first1=Ilan|title=Minority Stress and Mental Health in Gay Men|journal=Journal of Health and Social Behavior|date=March 1995|volume= 36|issue= 1|page=38 |url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/15461517|accessdate=July 24, 2017|doi=10.2307/2137286|jstor=2137286}}&lt;/ref&gt; Violence can slip anybody into a depressed state whether the violence is a type of physical abuse, mental abuse, or verbal abuse. A person can be harassed to the point where their depression becomes to much and they no longer experience any happiness. These factors all work together and make it extremely hard to avoid MDD.

== Effects of queer bullying ==

== Explicit and implicit homophobic and transphobic discriminatory behavior in educational settings ==

Homophobic and transphobic violence in educational settings can be categorized as explicit and implicit. Explicit homophobic and transphobic violence consists of overt acts that make subjects feel uncomfortable, hurt, humiliated or intimidated. Peers and educational staff are unlikely to intervene when witnessing these incidents. This contributes to normalizing such acts that become accepted as either a routine disciplinary measure or a means to resolve conflicts among students. Homophobic and transphobic violence – as with all school-related gender-based violence – is acutely underreported due to subjects’ fear of retribution, combined with inadequate or non-existent reporting, support and redress systems.&lt;ref&gt;GMR, UNESCO, and UNGEI, ‘School-related gender-based violence is preventing the achievement of quality education for all: Policy Paper 17 at 59th session of the Commission on the Status of Women in New York City’, 59th session of the Commission on the Status of Women in New York City.

Implicit homophobic and transphobic violence, sometimes called ‘symbolic violence’ or ‘institutional’ violence, is subtler than explicit violence. It consists of pervasive representations or attitudes that sometimes feel harmless or natural to the school community, but that allow or encourage homophobia and transphobia, including perpetuating harmful stereotypes. Policies and guidelines can reinforce or embed these representations or attitudes, whether in an individual institution or across an entire education sector. This way, they can become part of everyday practices and rules guiding school behaviour.&lt;ref&gt;ICGBV, ‘Addressing School Related Gender Based Violence: Learning from Practice: Learning Brief No. 10’, Irish Consortium on Gender Based Violence, Dublin, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;F. Leach, M. Dunne, and F. Salvi, ‘School-Related Gender based Violence: A global review of current issues and approaches in policy, programming and implementation responses to School-Related Gender-Based Violence (SRGBV) for the Education Sector’, UNESCO, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Examples of implicit homophobic and transphobic violence include:

* Asserting that some subjects are better suited to students based on their sexual orientation or gender identity/expression (for example, science for heterosexual male students and drama for gay male students).
* Suggesting that it is normal for heterosexual students to have greater agency or influence (for example, with the opinions of LGBTI students treated as marginal and unimportant).
* Reinforcing stereotypes related to sexual orientation or gender identity/expression in curriculum materials or teacher training, such as through images and discourse (for example, that refer to heterosexuality as ‘normal’).
* Reinforcing stereotypes related to sexual orientation or gender identity/expression in educational policies, rules and regulations (for example, by not even acknowledging that LGBTI students are part of the school community and by not specifying them in relevant policies).&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Statistics and examples ==

Teens face harassment, threats, and violence. A 1998 study in the US by [[Mental Health America]] found that students heard anti-gay slurs such as "homo", "faggot" and "sissy" about 26 times a day on average, or once every 14 minutes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Mental Health American, Bullying and Gay Youth |url=http://www.nmha.org/go/information/get-info/children-s-mental-health/bullying-and-gay-youth |publisher=National Mental Health Association |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120414144851/http://www.nmha.org/go/information/get-info/children-s-mental-health/bullying-and-gay-youth |archivedate=April 14, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a study conducted by the Association of Teachers and Lecturers, a union for UK professionals, the word "gay" was reported to be the most popular term of abuse heard by teachers on a regular basis.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title=How 'gay' Became Children's Insult of Choice|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/7289390.stm|publisher=BBC News|date=2008-03-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

About two-thirds of gay and lesbian students in [[Great Britain|British]] schools have suffered from gay bullying in 2007, according to a study done by the [[Schools Education Unit]] for [[LGBT|LGB]] activist group [[Stonewall (charity)|Stonewall]]. Almost all that had been bullied had experienced verbal attacks, 41 percent had been physically attacked, and 17 percent had received death threats. It also showed that over 50% of teachers did not respond to homophobic language which they had explicitly heard in the classroom, and only 25% of schools had told their students that homophobic bullying was wrong, showing "a shocking picture of the extent of homophobic bullying undertaken by fellow pupils and, alarmingly, school staff",&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|publisher=BBC News|title=Gay Bullying in Schools Common|date=June 26, 2007 |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/6239098.stm}}&lt;/ref&gt; with further studies conducted by the same charity in 2012 stated that 90% of teachers had had no training on the prevention of homophobic bullying. However, Ofsted's new 2012 framework did ask schools what they would be doing in order to combat the issue.&lt;ref name=Stonewall1&gt;{{cite web|title=Homophobic bullying|url=http://www.stonewall.org.uk/at_school/education_for_all/secondary_schools/homophobic_bullying/default.asp|website=stonewall.org.uk|publisher=Stonewall |accessdate=December 25, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Jane Edward Schilling''' (October 8, 1930 – September 13, 2017) was an American activist, historian, and university administrator who served as  founding Vice President of [[Martin University]] in Indianapolis, Indiana.

==Early life==
Born Nancy Mary Schilling in 1930 in the lake resort town of [[Minocqua, Wisconsin]], Jane Schilling was the eldest of five children of Lyle Franklin Schilling, a dentist, and wife, Rosalie Julia Wolk Schilling, a homemaker.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Early on, Nancy excelled in athletics and scholarship. Finding that her high school did not offer the courses she needed to take in order to become a dentist like her father, she moved to [[Green Bay, Wisconsin]] to live with two aunts to attend St. Joseph’s Academy for junior and senior high school. During this period, she found that she had a vocation to follow in the footsteps of her teachers and become a [http://www.csjsl.org/ Sister of St. Joseph of Carondolet].&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;Tribute to Sr. Jane Schilling. 2015 Martin University Founders Day Luncheon https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBVrj1JPH8g&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;Fern (Snooks) Winger, telephone interview, October 31, 2014, digital tape and typescript, Father Boniface Hardin Collection, Indiana Historical Society.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Jane Jelinski, written responses to interview questions, November 9, 2014, Father Boniface Hardin Collection, Indiana Historical Society.&lt;/ref&gt;

During her formation with the Sisters of St. Joseph, she received the name [[Religious sister|Sister]] Jane Edward, a combination of her younger sister’s and brother’s names. An avid scholar, she received her bachelor’s degree in European and American History at [[Fontbonne University]] in Saint Louis and her Master’s of Ancient History at [[Loyola University Chicago|Loyola University]] in [[Chicago]]. Following her first assignment as a teacher in St. Rita’s School in [[St. Louis]], she was next assigned to St. Matthew’s School in the inner city. Here, she developed a passion for civil rights and social justice. She assisted with curriculum development for students at the Saint Louis hospital for black residents, Homer G. Phillips, and assisted in ministering to ex-convicts at nearby [http://www.dismashouse.net/ Dismas House], established by [http://www.dismashouse.net/our-history.html Father Charles "Dismas" Clark] and [[Morris Shenker]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

==Holy Angels==
In 1964, Schilling's was assigned to teach at [http://www.holyangelscatholicschool.org/ Holy Angels Catholic School] in [[Indianapolis|Indianapolis, Indiana]], a school that had transitioned to a majority black student population. She embraced this role with high energy, establishing a drum and bugle corps to increase school pride and visibility within the community. After she was named principal, she engaged in implementing educational reforms of the time, such as [[open classroom]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;s, [[Lateralization of brain function|right/left brain]] teaching, and [[Psychomotor learning|psychomotor]] approaches for teaching reading.&lt;ref&gt;Ferdye Bryant, Margaret Graves, and Doris Parker, “A New Journey of Hope: Holy Angels Catholic Church, 1903-2003” (Indianapolis: Holy Angels Catholic Church, 2003), 36.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;Sr. Pat Quinn, CSJ, telephone interview, April 29, 2015, digital tape and typescript, Father Boniface Hardin Collection, Indiana Historical Society.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;"Sister Jane Edward Schilling," biography, Sisters of St. Joseph of Carondolet, St. Louis Province, http://www.csjsl.org/news/sister-jane-edward-schilling-1930-2017.php&lt;/ref&gt;

Shortly after her arrival at Holy Angels, Schilling's life was radically changed when a new Associate Pastor at Holy Angels Parish, [[Boniface Hardin]], arrived on the scene. The two shared a commitment to education and social change, a bond that created a partnership that would last for the remainder of their lives.

Working together, Schilling and Hardin became activists in church and community reform. They fought police brutality and targeting of black citizens, de facto school [[Racial segregation in the United States|segregation]], lack of representation of black clergy and traditions within the [[Catholic Church]], poverty, and unfair [[Housing discrimination (United States)|housing]] practices. A key focus became the fight to prevent a major highway, [[Interstate 65 in Indiana|Interstate 65]], from bifurcating the predominately black northwest neighborhood surrounding [http://holyangelsindy.org/ Holy Angels Parish].&lt;ref&gt;“CORE Threatens Protest in Planned Highway Controversy,” ''Indianapolis Recorder,'' February 10, 1968.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;“Seek Lawsuit to Halt Construction of Highway thru Negro Community,” ''Indianapolis Recorder,'' February 3, 1968.&lt;/ref&gt;

When police pressure on the Archbishop of Indianapolis, [[Paul Clarence Schulte|Paul Schulte]], triggered a decision to remove Hardin from Holy Angels Parish in 1969, parishioners rose up and staged a nationally publicized demonstration in [[Saints Peter and Paul Cathedral (Indianapolis)|Saints Peter and Paul Cathedral]] where the Archbishop was presiding at [[Easter]] services.&lt;ref&gt;"150 Walk Out in a Protest at Indianapolis Cathedral,” ''The New York Times'', April 7, 1969.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Demonstrators Protest Treatment of Priest,” ''Indianapolis Recorder'', April 12, 1969.&lt;/ref&gt; Although the Archbishop rescinded his order, Hardin left Holy Angels to found Martin Center, an educational and social justice center, at the close of 1969. Within a year, Schilling received permission from her religious community to work full-time at Martin Center as Education Coordinator.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

==The Martin Center==
Martin Center was named for [[Martin Luther King Jr.]] and [[Martin de Porres|St. Martin de Porres]], patron saint, within the Catholic Church, of poor and mixed race people. Its mission evolved from an initial goal of educating clergy and white people about discriminatory attitudes and practices to include celebrating black cultural heritage and engaging black community members in activism and self-identity. While Hardin traveled as a speaker and consultant to raise funds for the Center, Schilling became the day-to-day administrator.

Drawing on her background as a history scholar, Schilling did the research and production of designs and materials for workshops, speeches, and activities of Martin Center. Soon, the mission of the Center expanded to include the [http://themartincenter.org/ Martin Sickle Cell Center], which received major national funding to educate the community and screen for this disease, and the Afro-American Institute, which focused on African and African-American culture and achievements.&lt;ref&gt;"Martin Center’s success is vehicle by Father Boniface,” ''Indianapolis Recorder,'' March 11, 1972&lt;/ref&gt; Schilling served as Director of Community Education at the Sickle Cell Center from 1970 to 1977 and received its award for 25 Years of Dedication to Sickle Cell and Visionary Leadership.&lt;ref&gt;Father Kenneth Taylor, “Sister Jane Schilling: A Model of Faith,” Indianapolis Recorder, September 28, 2017. http://www.indianapolisrecorder.com/religion/article_bb7767ce-a454-11e7-8ce7-13f0c08e208e.html&lt;/ref&gt;

Through the Afro-American Institute, Martin Center housed a library of materials and artifacts, created and acquired by Schilling and Hardin. They also produced a regular scholarly periodical, the ''Afro-American Journal'' (1973–78);&lt;ref&gt;Collections of the ''Afro-American Journal'' are in the Indiana University libraries, the Indiana State Library, the Indianapolis Public Library, and the Boniface Hardin Collection, Indiana Historical Society.&lt;/ref&gt; two full-length TV documentaries—''The Kingdom Builders'' and ''For Love of Freedom''&lt;ref&gt;Both films are available in their original Betamax format and DVD. Father Boniface Hardin Collection, Indiana Historical Society.&lt;/ref&gt;—for the local NBC affiliate in Indianapolis; a weekly radio program, ''The [https://media.dlib.indiana.edu/?f%5Bcollection_ssim%5D%5B%5D=The+Afro-American+in+Indiana+%28radio+series%29 Afro-American in Indiana]'' (1971-1991) for WIAN, the local public radio station;  and a weekly television show, ''Afro-American'' (1974–79), for public television. Schilling co-hosted these programs and was the major researcher behind the productions.

As Martin Center expanded its educational offerings to the community, it collaborated with [[Indiana University – Purdue University Indianapolis|Indiana University Purdue University-Indianapolis]] to create courses for college credit. This venture led Schilling and Hardin to found Indiana’s only minority serving institution, [[Martin University]].

==Martin University==
From the start, Schilling's role in the creation and growth of Martin University was chief academic officer, strategist, and educational developer.  As Founding Vice President for Academic Affairs, she was a key voice in articulating the philosophy behind the institution, inspired by the concept of “[[andragogy]]” advanced by [[Malcolm Knowles]]. The approach emphasized drawing on the strengths and past experience of adult learners, the major population of the university. Through her hiring decisions and curriculum and faculty development efforts, Schilling collaborated with Hardin to become the guiding force behind the school’s educational direction.

Schilling presided over Academic Affairs at Martin University from its early beginnings with a handful of students in 1977 as Martin Center College, through 1979 as Martin College became a separate entity from Martin Center, and finally through 1990, when the addition of graduate programs enabled the change to Martin University, a school with nearly 1000 students. She was the key architect of successful accreditation and expansion proposals to the [[North Central Association of Colleges and Schools]] (changed in 2014 to the [[Higher Learning Commission]]). She became known at Martin for her sense of humor and the compassion she showed students through acts such as serving soup to those who came directly from work to classes.

While Vice President of Martin University, Schilling participated in numerous initiatives within the Indianapolis community, including serving on the [http://www.crispusattucksmuseum.org/ Crispus Attucks Museum] Committee and acting as consultant and workshop facilitator for the [[Indianapolis Public Schools]]. She continued to guide the Martin Center, serving as its Executive Director from 1984 to 1988.

Schilling received a number of Martin University Awards. These included the Mary McLeod Bethune Award and the Martin University Board of Trustees Wind Under Our Wings Award. In 2005, she received the Honorary Doctor of Laws degree from Martin University. After 30 years of service, Schilling retired from Martin University in 2007. She died on September 13, 2017 at Nazareth Living House, Sisters of St. Joseph of Carondolet, St. Louis.

Meckseper’s father is German artist [[Friedrich Meckseper]] (born 1936).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Josephine Meckseper|last=Enwezor|first=Okwui|publisher=Hatje Cantz|year=2007|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Josephine Meckseper studied at [[Berlin University of the Arts]] in Germany from 1986–1990, and received a MFA from the [[California Institute of the Arts]] in 1992.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://artipedia.org/artsnews/exhibitions/2007/07/14/josephine-meckseper-at-kunstmuseum-stuttgart/ |title=Josephine Meckseper at Kunstmuseum Stuttgart - Artipedia - Arts News |last= |first= |date= |website= |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070814072808/http://artipedia.org/artsnews/exhibitions/2007/07/14/josephine-meckseper-at-kunstmuseum-stuttgart/ |archive-date=2007-08-14 |dead-url=yes |access-date= |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Work ==
Meckseper’s work is politically-informed and strongly influenced by [[Situationist International]] and [[Angry Brigade]] ideology.&lt;ref&gt;[http://dismagazine.com/discussion/27805/the-final-shop/ Lookofsky, Sarah, “Josephine Meckseper – The Final Shop,” dismagazine.com]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1994, Meckseper founded ''FAT Magazine'', privately distributed at supermarkets, galleries and museums, sometimes heroically stuck on walls in homage Jean-Paul Marat. Four issues have come out since 1994.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fatmagazine.us/ FAT magazine website. Retrieved August 8, 2016.]&lt;/ref&gt;

Meckseper’s installations, sculptures, photographs, and videos use industrial forms of presentation such as vitrines, window displays, and magazines to demonstrate inextricable influences of consumer culture on society and cultural production. Meckseper melds the aesthetics of modernism with the formal language of commercial display, combining them with images and artifacts of historical and political events.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://andrearosengallery.com/artists/josephine-meckseper/bio|title=Andrea Rosen Gallery|last=|first=|date=|website=Andrea Rosen Gallery|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Often contained within Meckseper’s signature displays are paintings that nod to 20th century European modernist art, such as [[Constructivism (art)|Russian constructivism]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Josephine Meckseper Catalogue No. 2|last=Lotringer|first=Sylvère|publisher=Sternberg Press|year=2006|isbn=|location=New York|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as photographs and video taken by Meckseper at present-day protests.

'''Manhattan Oil Project'''

In 2012, Meckseper presented the public project Manhattan Oil Project, installing two monumental kinetic sculptures modeled after mid-20th century oil pumps on the corner of 46th Street and 8th Avenue in New York City.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.artproductionfund.org/projects/josephine-meckseper-manhattan-oil-project|title=Art Production Fund|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; These 25 feet tall sculptures were inspired by oil pumps that the artist discovered in Electra, a boarded-up town once famous for being the pump jack capital of Texas. Each sculpture was fully motorized to simulate the motions of a working oil pump. Placed in a vacant lot next to Times Square, the pump jacks recalled the ruins of ghost towns, forgotten monuments of America's decaying industrial past.

'''Pellea[s]'''

Meckseper's film ''Pellea[s]'' is a narrative film released in 2018 that expresses through cinema the narratives and relationships contained within the universe within her glass and mirror vitrines. Meckseper explains, "''Pellea[s]'' expands on this historical discourse through cinema and acted out narratives. It is a modern adaptation of [[Maurice Maeterlinck]]’s play ''Pelléas et Mélisande'', conflated with the current political realities in the US."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/sophiefriedman/2018/01/04/three-australian-arts-festivals-to-see-right-now/2/#27404af258d3|title=Three Australian Arts Festivals To See Right Now|last=Friedman|first=Sophie|date=January 4, 2018|website=Forbes|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Live Arts Week'''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.liveartsweek.it Live Arts Week]&lt;/ref&gt; is a project by Xing, born in 2012 out the fusion of the experiences of the two Bologna festivals (2000&gt;2011): [[Netmage]] - International Live Media Festival and [[F.I.S.Co.]] - Festival Internazionale sullo Spettacolo Contemporaneo.
Live Arts Week takes place in [[Bologna]], Italy, once a year, and it is developed throughout one week in different locations and settings in town.

==Mission==

Event dedicated to live arts, it hosts a blend of artworks and productions that revolve around the presence, performance and perceptual experience of sounds and visions, with a program of live works (performances, environments, concerts, live media, expanded cinema) presented by important personalities in the international and contemporary research scene. The set-up suggests a citywide event, involving several spaces, organizations and institutions active in the field of contemporary arts in Bologna.

'''''Living High and Letting Die: Our Illusion of Innocence''''' {{ISBN|0-19-510859-0}} is a philosophical book by [[Peter K. Unger]], published in 1996.

==Overview==
Inspired by [[Peter Singer]]'s 1971 essay "[[Famine, Affluence, and Morality]],"&lt;ref name="Kuhse"&gt;{{cite book|title=Unsanctifying human life: essays on ethics|year=2002|publisher=Blackwell|location=New York|isbn=0631225072|editor=Helga Kuhse|pages=2–3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Unger argues that for people in the developed world to live morally, they are morally obliged to make sacrifices to help mitigate human suffering and premature death in the third world, and further that it is acceptable (and morally right) to lie, cheat, and steal to mitigate suffering.

Unger argues that the intuitive moral judgments most people have of several hypothetical moral scenarios, ''The Shallow Pond'', ''The Vintage Sedan'', and ''The Envelope'', are inconsistent.

Unger presents the hypothetical case of ''The Vintage Sedan'': 
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Not truly rich, your one luxury in life is a vintage Mercedes sedan that, with much time, attention, and money, you've restored to mint condition... One day, you stop at the intersection of two small country roads, both lightly traveled.  Hearing a voice screaming for help, you get out and see a man who's wounded and covered with a lot of his blood.  Assuring you that his wound is confined to one of his legs, the man also informs you that he was a medical student for two full years.  And, despite his expulsion for cheating on his second year final exams, which explains his indigent status since, he's knowledgeably tied his shirt near the wound as to stop the flow.  So, there's no urgent danger of losing his life, you're informed, but there's great danger of losing his limb.  This can be prevented, however, if you drive him to a rural hospital fifty miles away.  "How did the wound occur?" you ask.  An avid bird-watcher, he admits that he trespassed on a nearby field and, in carelessly leaving, cut himself on rusty barbed wire.  Now, if you'd aid this trespasser, you must lay him across your fine back seat.  But, then, your fine upholstery will be soaked through with blood, and restoring the car will cost over five thousand dollars.  So, you drive away.  Picked up the next day by another driver, he survives but loses the wounded leg.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Unger reports that most people respond strongly that abandoning the hitchhiker is abominable behavior, and he contrasts this near-universal harsh judgment with the lenient judgments most people give to ''The Envelope'':
&lt;blockquote&gt;
In your mailbox, there's something from (the U.S. Committee for) [[UNICEF]].  After reading it through, you correctly believe that, unless you soon send in a check for $100, then, instead of each living many more years, over thirty more children will die soon.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Unger argues that the factors that distinguish The Envelope from The Vintage Sedan, in which morality compels us to make a sacrifice, are not morally significant, using [[thought experiment]]s such as variations on the [[trolley problem]] to illustrate his point. Unger contends that psychological factors obscure the moral questions, and that our moral intuitions about problems such as these provide an inconsistent window into our true [[moral value]]s.

Unger conspicuously indicates that the author's [[royalties]] from the sales of this book go to [[UNICEF]] and to [[Oxfam America]].

Barry Smith and Berit Brogaard (writing under the pseudonym of Nicola [[Nicolas_Bourbaki|Bourbaki]]) argue in their [http://ontology.buffalo.edu/smith/articles/Livinghigh.pdf "Living High and Letting Die"], that Unger's argument undermines one central approach to the defense of abortion advanced by Judith Jarvis Thomson in her famous [[Violinist (thought experiment)]]:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
Imagine that your body has become attached, without your permission, to that of a sick violinist. The violinist is a human being. He will die if you detach him. Such detachment seems, nonetheless, to be morally permissible. Thomson argues that an unwantedly pregnant woman is in an analogous situation. Her argument is considered by many to have established the moral permissibility of abortion even under the assumption that the foetus is a human being. 
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Following the strategy adopted by Unger, Smith and Brogaard point to a number of scenarios in which a woman's right to decide what happens in and to her body seems to be outweighed by the right to life of the violinist.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="21199">{{short description|Second-century Carpocratian Christian religious leader}}
{{good article}}
'''Marcellina''' was an [[early Christianity|early Christian]] [[Carpocrates|Carpocratian]] religious leader in the mid-second century AD known primarily from the writings of [[Irenaeus]] and [[Origen]]. She originated in [[Alexandria]], but moved to [[Rome]] during the episcopate of [[Pope Anicetus|Anicetus]] ({{circa}} 157 – 168). She attracted large numbers of followers and founded the Carpocratian sect of '''Marcellians'''. Like other Carpocratians, Marcellina and her followers believed in [[antinomianism]], also known as [[libertine|libertinism]], the idea that obedience to laws and regulations is unnecessary in order to attain salvation. They believed that [[Jesus]] was only a man, but saw him as a model to be emulated, albeit one which a believer was capable of surpassing. Marcellina's community appears to have sought to literally implement the foundational Carpocratian teaching of [[social egalitarianism]]. The Marcellians in particular are reported to have [[Human branding|branded]] their disciples on the insides of their right [[earlobe]]s and [[Religious images in Christian theology|venerated images]] of Jesus as well as Greek philosophers such as [[Pythagoras]], [[Plato]], and [[Aristotle]]. Although the Marcellians identified themselves as "[[Gnosis|gnostics]]", many modern scholars do not classify them as members of the sect of [[Gnosticism]].

==Historical context==
[[File:Dura Europos baptistry women at the tomb.jpg|thumb|upright=1.7|Fresco from the [[nave]] of the [[Dura-Europos church]], dating to {{circa}} 240 AD, depicting [[Mary Magdalene]] alongside two other women (the third now almost completely missing due to extensive damage) approaching the [[empty tomb]] of Jesus.{{sfn|Haskins|2005|pages=58–59}} Such women were the "explicit models" for Marcellina and other early female preachers.{{sfn|Streete|1999|page=352}}]]

Women played prominent roles in many early Christians sects as prophets, teachers, healers, missionaries, and [[presbyter]]s.{{sfn|Pagels|1989|page=60}} [[Mary Magdalene]] and [[Mary of Bethany]] were female followers of Jesus who are mentioned in the gospels and were believed to know the "[[Sacred mysteries|mysteries]]" of the [[Kingship and kingdom of God|kingdom of God]].{{sfn|Streete|1999|page=352}} Women like Mary and Martha were the explicit role models for Marcellina and her fellow female preachers.{{sfn|Streete|1999|page=352}} A creed that may have been recited at Christian initiation ceremonies is quoted by the apostle [[Paul the Apostle|Paul]] in {{bibleverse|Galatians|3:28|9}}: "There is neither Jew nor Greek, there is neither bond nor free, there is neither male nor female: for ye are all one in Christ Jesus."{{sfn|Pagels|1989|page=61}} In the late first century, [[Marcion of Sinope]] ({{circa}} 85 – {{circa}} 160) appointed women as presbyters on an equal basis as men.{{sfn|Pagels|1989|page=60}}

In the second century, the [[Valentinianism|Valentinians]], a Gnostic sect, regarded women as equal to men.{{sfn|Pagels|1989|page=60}} The [[Montanism|Montanists]] regarded two prophetesses, [[Maximilla]] and [[Prisca (Prophet)|Prisca]], as the founders of their movement.{{sfn|Pagels|1989|page=60}} Female religious leaders like Marcellina were not favored by orthodox theologians, who accused them of madness, unchastity, and [[demonic possession]].{{sfn|Streete|1999|page=352}} The [[Church Fathers|Church Father]] [[Tertullian]] ({{circa}} 155 – {{circa}} 240) complained: "These heretical women—how audacious they are! They have no modesty; they are bold enough to teach, to engage in argument, to enact [[exorcism]]s, to undertake cures, and, it may be, even to baptize!"{{sfn|Pagels|1989|page=60}} He denounced one female religious leader in North Africa as "that viper".{{sfn|Pagels|1989|page=60}}

==Life and teachings==
===Carpocratian teachings===
As a Carpocratian, Marcellina taught the doctrine of [[Antinomianism|antinomianism]], or [[Libertine|libertinism]],{{sfn|Rudolph|1983|page=299}}{{sfn|Brackney|2012|page=75}} which holds that only faith and love are necessary to attain salvation and that all other perceived requirements, especially obedience to laws and regulations, are unnecessary.{{sfn|Rudolph|1983|page=299}}{{sfn|Brackney|2012|page=75}} She, like other Carpocratians, believed that the [[soul]] must follow the path to redemption, possibly going through many [[incarnation]]s.{{sfn|Rudolph|1983|page=299}}{{sfn|Brackney|2012|page=75}} The goal of the believer is the escape from the cycle of reincarnation by ascending through several stages of deification.{{sfn|Brackney|2012|page=75}} The Carpocratians believed that Jesus was only human, not divine,{{sfn|Brackney|2012|page=75}} and saw him as a exemplary model to be followed, but an example which a particularly devout believer was capable of surpassing.{{sfn|Rudolph|1983|page=299}} Jesus's prime virtue was that he could perfectly remember the Divine from his [[pre-existence]].{{sfn|Brackney|2012|page=75}} They also venerated Greek philosophers as models to be emulated as well.{{sfn|Brackney|2012|page=75}}{{sfn|Taylor|2018|pages=214–215}} The Marcellians' syncretic cult of images was a natural consequence of this teaching.{{sfn|Rudolph|1983|page=299}}{{sfn|Brackney|2012|page=75}} One of the foundational teachings of the Carpocratians was the idea of [[social egalitarianism]], which advocated equality for all people.{{sfn|Lampe|2003|page=319}}{{sfn|Brackney|2012|page=75}} Marcellina's position as the leader of the Carpocratian community in Rome indicates that, for her community at least, this was an idea which was meant to be literally implemented.{{sfn|Lampe|2003|page=319}} Some Carpocratians, possibly including Marcellina, [[Communalism|held all property in common]] and [[Open relationship|shared sexual partners]].{{sfn|Brackney|2012|page=75}} They also celebrated a form of [[agape feast]].{{sfn|Brackney|2012|page=75}}

===''Adversus Haereses''===
[[File:Kapitolinischer Pythagoras adjusted.jpg|thumb|Irenaeus records that the Marcellians venerated images of Greek philosophers, including [[Pythagoras]], [[Plato]], and [[Aristotle]].{{sfn|Brackney|2012|page=75}}{{sfn|McGuire|1999|page=260}}{{sfn|Williams|1996|pages=107–108, 127}} Busts of philosophers, such as this one of Pythagoras, were common objects of adoration in second-century Roman society.{{sfn|Williams|1996|pages=107–108, 127}}]]

The Church Father [[Irenaeus]] ({{circa}} 130 – {{circa}} 202) records in his apologetic treatise ''[[Adversus Haereses]]'':
&lt;blockquote&gt;Others of them [i.e. the Carpocratians] employ outward marks, branding their disciples inside the lobe of the right ear. From among these also arose Marcellina, who came to Rome under [the episcopate of] [[Pope Anicetus|Anicetus]], and, holding these doctrines, she led multitudes astray. They style themselves Gnostics. They also possess images, some of them painted, and others formed from different kinds of material; while they maintain that a likeness of Christ was made by [[Pontius Pilate|Pilate]] at that time when Jesus lived among them. They crown these images, and set them up along with the images of the philosophers of the world that is to say, with the images of [[Pythagoras]], and [[Plato]], and [[Aristotle]], and the rest. They have also other modes of honouring these images, after the same manner of the Gentiles.&lt;ref&gt;[[Irenaeus]], ''[[Adversus Haereses]]'' [http://www.newadvent.org/fathers/0103125.htm Book I, Chapter 25, section 6], translated by Alexander Roberts and William Rambaut&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Marcellina is the only woman associated with early Gnostic Christianity who is recorded to have been an active religious leader in her own right.{{sfn|McGuire|1999|page=261}} Other women such as Helena (allegedly a former [[Tyre, Lebanon|Tyrian]] prostitute turned muse of [[Simon Magus]]), Philumena (a prophetess associated with [[Apelles (gnostic)|Apelles]]), and Flora (a student of [[Ptolemy (gnostic)|Ptolemy]]) are known to have been active as prophetesses, teachers, and disciples involved in sects led by men,{{sfn|McGuire|1999|pages=260–261}} but none of them are known to have been leaders themselves.{{sfn|McGuire|1999|page=261}} Nonetheless, Marcellina still appears in relation to Carpocrates, a male teacher, who appears to have been more actively involved than her in leading followers, writing treatises, and teaching students.{{sfn|McGuire|1999|page=261}} Anne McGuire states that it is unclear whether this description of Marcellina in relation to Carpocrates is a result of Irenaeus's own patriarchal worldview, the actual relationship between her and him, or both.{{sfn|McGuire|1999|page=261}}

Marcellina's use of images of Jesus and Greek philosophers would not have been unusual in Roman society at the time, because busts and images of philosophers were common objects of adoration in second-century Roman society.{{sfn|Williams|1996|pages=107–108, 127}}{{sfn|Taylor|2018|pages=214–215}} While Irenaeus interprets this as a sign of Marcellina's heterodox teaching,{{sfn|Williams|1996|page=108}} to any non-Christian Roman, it would have actually made her seem far less aberrant than "orthodox" Christians.{{sfn|Williams|1996|page=108}} By venerating busts of philosophers and including Jesus among them as the greatest, Marcellina's followers were honoring him in the same way that other philosophers were typically honored throughout the Greco-Roman world.{{sfn|Taylor|2018|page=215}} The Carpocratians may have had a more intellectual outlook than other sects,{{sfn|Taylor|2018|page=215}} since, according to [[Clement of Alexandria]], Carpocrates's son [[Epiphanes (gnostic)|Epiphanes]] had been trained in [[Platonism|Platonic philosophy]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Clement of Alexandria]], ''[[Stromata]]'' 3.5.3&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Taylor|2018|page=215}}{{sfn|Lampe|2003|page=320}} Nonetheless, [[Michael Allen Williams]] states that the veneration of images seems highly unexpected for a supposedly Gnostic sect,{{sfn|Williams|1996|page=127}} since Gnostics are thought to have held the physical body in contempt.{{sfn|Williams|1996|page=127}} He suggests that Marcellina and her followers, like their pagan contemporaries, may have viewed representations of philosophers' physical likenesses as "windows to the soul" and a means of reflecting on the person's teachings.{{sfn|Williams|1996|page=127}} [[Peter Lampe]] interprets Marcillina's use of images of famous philosophers as an indication of [[religious syncretism]].{{sfn|Lampe|2003|page=320}}

[[Joan E. Taylor]] notes that Irenaeus does not state that the Marcellians' portrait of Jesus was inaccurate or that portraits of Jesus were inherently immoral.{{sfn|Taylor|2018|page=215}} She also argues that the Marcellians' busts of Jesus and other philosophers may have survived long after their sect declined,{{sfn|Taylor|2018|page=215}} observing that, nearly a century later, the Roman emperor [[Alexander Severus]] (reigned 222 – 235) is said to have possessed a collection of portrait busts of various philosophers, religious figures, and historical figures including Jesus, [[Orpheus]], [[Apollonius of Tyana]], [[Alexander the Great]], and [[Abraham]].{{sfn|Taylor|2018|page=215}} She remarks, "For all we know, one of the many unidentified philosopher busts that exist in today's collections might have been thought of as Jesus in the second–third centuries."{{sfn|Taylor|2018|page=215}}

According to David Brakke, the reason why Marcellina and the members of her school identified themselves as "Gnostics" was not as a sectarian identification with the branch of early Christianity known as "[[Gnosticism]]",{{sfn|Brakke|2010|pages=48–49}} but rather as an epithet for "the ideal or true Christian, the one whose acquaintance with God has been perfected".{{sfn|Brakke|2010|page=49}} He notes that Irenaeus himself identifies Marcellina and her sect with the Carpocratians, not with the "Gnostic school of thought".{{sfn|Brakke|2010|page=49}} Also, [[Hippolytus of Rome]], who relied on Irenaeus as a source, references that the another sect known as the [[Naassenes]] "call themselves 'gnostics' in their own way, as if they alone have drunk from the amazing acquaintance of the Perfect and Good."{{sfn|Brakke|2010|pages=48–49}} In the late fourth century, the ascetic monk [[Evagrius Ponticus]] described the most advanced stage of Christian asceticism as "the Gnostic",{{sfn|Brakke|2010|page=49}} indicating that, despite the association of the word "Gnostic" with Gnosticism, it still retained its original positive meaning in the sense with which Marcellina and her disciples identified.{{sfn|Brakke|2010|page=49}} [[Bentley Layton]] does not classify Marcellina and her followers as members of the Gnostic sect either.{{sfn|Williams|1996|page=42}}

===''Contra Celsum''===
[[Origen]] ({{circa}} 184 – {{circa}} 253) also briefly mentions Marcellina in his ''[[Contra Celsum]]'', stating that "[[Celsus]] knows also of Marcellians who follow Marcellina, and [[Harpocrates|Harpocratians]] who follow [[Salome (disciple)|Salome]], and others who follow [[Mary Magdalene|Mariamme]], and others who follow [[Martha of Bethany|Martha]]."{{sfn|McGuire|1999|page=260}} Anne McGuire states that, because all the other figures listed by Origen in this passage are figures who appear in the canonical gospels, it is possible that the Marcellians may have regarded Marcellina, not only as a teacher and religious leader, but as "an authoritative source of apostolic tradition".{{sfn|McGuire|1999|page=260}} Williams notes that Origen seems to have been aware that the Marcellians called themselves Gnostics,{{sfn|Williams|1996|page=41}} since, elsewhere in ''Contra Celsum'', he notes that one of Celsus's arguments against Christianity was the existence of different sects, including ones "who call themselves gnostics".{{sfn|Williams|1996|page=41}} This would presumably include Marcellina and her followers,{{sfn|Williams|1996|page=41}} but Origen refrains from calling them by this term.{{sfn|Williams|1996|page=41}}

==Legacy==
It is unclear how Marcellina and her followers were regarded by orthodox Christians living in Rome during the 150s and 160s.{{sfn|Lampe|2003|page=392}} Irenaeus states that, among members of his own congregation in [[Gaul]] in the 180s, "we have no fellowship with them either in doctrine or in morals or in our daily social life",{{sfn|Lampe|2003|page=392}} but this statement should not be taken to apply to Christians living in Rome over twenty years prior.{{sfn|Lampe|2003|page=392}} Irenaeus also states, "[[Satan]] had set forth these people [i.e. Marcellina and her followers] to blaspheme the holy name of the church, so that the [pagan] people turn their ears from the preaching of truth when they hear their different way of teaching and think we Christians are all like them. Indeed, when they see their religiosity, they dishonor us all."{{sfn|Lampe|2003|page=392}} He adds that "They misuse the name [Christian] as a mask."{{sfn|Lampe|2003|page=392}} This indicates that Marcellina and her Carpocratian followers called themselves "Christians"{{sfn|Lampe|2003|page=392}} and, at least to outsiders, her sect appeared to be connected to other branches of Christianity.{{sfn|Lampe|2003|page=392}}

[[Peter Lampe]] states that it is possible that members of the orthodox community in Rome simply allowed Marcillina and her sect to silently coexist,{{sfn|Lampe|2003|page=392}} but that it is also possible that they may have actively condemned them.{{sfn|Lampe|2003|page=392}} [[Robert M. Grant (theologian)|Robert M. Grant]] identifies the anti-Gnostic writings of [[Polycarp]] and [[Justin Martyr]] as partially an indirect reaction against Marcellina and her permissive moral teachings.{{sfn|Grant|1990|pages=59–61}} Marcillina and other female prophets like her were consistently portrayed negatively in the histories and canons written by proponents of orthodoxy.{{sfn|Streete|1999|page=352}} According to William H. Brackney, sources indicate that Carpocratians may have continued to exist as late as the fourth century.{{sfn|Brackney|2012|page=75}}

[[File:Mit Borrás. Mother Machine. Installation view at Exgirlfriend Gallery. Berlin 2018.jpg|thumb|Mit Borrás. Mother Machine. Installation view at Exgirlfriend Gallery. Belrin 2018 © Mit Borrás]]
'''Mit Borrás''' ([[Madrid]] *[[1982]]) is a Spanish artist. 

He received his BFA in Madrid, Spain and specialization in Art and Cultural Studies in Berlin, ([[Germany]]). He developed his research on Media Art at the Twente University in [[Enschede]], (the [[Netherlands]]) (2006) where he participated intensely in the Dutch contemporary art scene. He relocated back to [[Madrid]]  where he oversees the production of video art festivals while also carrying out projects as an independent curator. In 2010 he moved to [[Berlin]]  to participate in the Glogauair Residency&lt;ref&gt;http://www.glogauair.net/&lt;/ref&gt; and co-directed Fünf Galerie together with Rachel Lamot&lt;ref&gt;http://rachellamot.com/&lt;/ref&gt;. He has worked as a coordinator of several cultural projects regarding media art and was working as a [[curator]] for the [[Instituto Cervantes]]  in [[Berlin]]. He also currently combines his artistic practice with his work as an art critic in Neo2 Magazine&lt;ref&gt;https://www.neo2.com/&lt;/ref&gt;.

His work is exhibited internationally in selected exhibitions such as in the Hara Museum, Tokyo (2010), Kreuzberg Pavillon, Germany (2013) and Norway (2016), Fonoteca Nacional, Mexico DF (2010), Palacio Fernandini, Lima (2016), Aleph Projects, Tel Aviv (2017), and the Museum of Fine Arts in Chile (2017). He has also been represented by Inés Barrenechea Gallery (2010-14). He continues to lecture within England, Colombia, Peru, the Netherlands, Spain and Germany. His work has been selected and awarded by Transmediale, (2011), United Creators Awards (2009), Loop Barcelona (2010, 2015-17), Art Lima (2016) and The Media Art Biennale in Chile (2017). He currently lives and works in Madrid and is a member of the international agency of artists and theorists Front Views&lt;ref&gt;http://www.frontviews.de/&lt;/ref&gt; in Berlin. Mit Borrás is represented by Exgirlfriend Gallery&lt;ref&gt;http://www.exgirlfriendberlin.com/&lt;/ref&gt;   

== Critic about the Work ==
[[File:Club. Installation View. Mit Borrás, 2016.jpg|thumb|Club. Installation View. Mit Borrás, 2016]]
Mit Borrás addresses [[technology]] and [[progress]] as new cult paradigms, often through the visual language of health and sport. He toys with the idea of [[ergonomics]] and softness in the development of new industrial forms, present in the works carried out since 2014 such as: Control Pool, Orthopedics, Youth Cloud, Techno Light, Devices, Artificial Rocks, Drone State of Mind or Ergonomic Technology. These works praise the idea of technology and well-being as a structure model of our time. Borrás emphasizes the objects that surround us as the objects that eventually define us as individuals and as a society; drones, gadgets, prosthetics, immobilizers, textile trends and their microperforated elastic fabrics, synthetic materials, medical and biomechanical engineering, and the design of products for leisure and relax. 

The artist uses intersecting lenses of the contemporary body and technology to interpret the homo consumericus behavior and diagnose the crusade a Western individual of the XXI Century. Inworks such as Ergonomic Shape (2016) in which a block of granite is supported on a medicine ball, or the Stones series (2015) in which the artist disables tactile screens by tying them to large pieces of quartz, it is common to find disconnect between technology and nature. This confrontation between digital system and cosmos is presented by the artist as a reinterpreation of Sagan’s idea that everything that is, what has been or what will be. For the artist, this implies a confrontation between a gullible society in a consumerist system and the innate course of nature. Works such as the palm trees of Palm Deformation (2016) or Club (2016) in which a gallery equipped with a strobe light and techno music is flooded with smoke, make allusion to all those current elements that are part of our life of evasion, fun and lightness, a lightness understood in the manner of [[Gilles Lipovetsky]]: like a ghost that frivolizes and makes provisional everything that was previously designed to be eternal.

'''Mookie Tenembaum''' (born 1955) is an Argentine born polymath; philosopher, lawyer, inventor, conceptual multidiciplinary artist and a radio host.

Tenembaum's philosophy, first published under the title "Disillusionism" in 2012,&lt;ref&gt;''Delilusionismo'' (Spanish Edition) Mookie, Tenembaum, Planeta (2012) {{ISBN|9789504928386}}&lt;/ref&gt; revolving around original concepts like "Autothanatodeimia", "Illusions" and "Anti-Forms", introduces original and critical perspectives on human behavior and organization.

Tenembaum's work reflects his views on [[Sovereign state|the State]], freedom, and ecology. For instance, he placed a ton of ice in the [[Plaza de Mayo]] in [[Buenos Aires]] and named it Placebo. He also caused controversy by publicly  projecting  on the chest and backs of six  half naked ballerinas two video spots: one a popular [[Coca-Cola]] TV ad in which a polar bear played with a baby seal and shared a Coke with it while in the opposite one a polar bear hunts and bloodily devours a baby seal, he named the piece Bearshit.

Since December 2015, Tenembaum leads a morning radio show called ''El Observador Internacional'', in which he analyses the landscape of international politics. It is delivered by [[Radio Jai]], an Argentine-Jewish radio station.

== Biography ==
He attended Law School at the [[Hebrew University of Jerusalem]], and specialized in Anthropology at [[Temple University of Philadelphia]]. As a lawyer, he  also  worked as a city attorney of the city of [[Jerusalem]]. During the 90s he decided that some of his ideas could only be created and developed through art, specially art related to new technologies. Therefore, during the past years, Mookie has concentrated specifically on reflecting on the different problems related to the [[State (polity)|State]] by means of creating new-media works. Currently, Mookie is working on pieces having to do with the different social and ideological problems of the state, developing projects such as "Genesis", which by means of an on-line system which generates "trusts" with the status of juridical persons, it reveals how the State presents "traps" in their formulation and efficiency, which are not easily readable for most citizens. With this type of projects, Mookie makes them visible, strongly criticizing the State apparatus ruling Latin America. Chasing utopian goals, with his projects Mookie proposes social reinvention and, as a consequence, refoundation. His compasses in this goal are [[George Orwell]], [[J.J. Rousseau]], and [[John Locke]]'s theories, as well as [[Minarchist]] ideas. An expert on the Internet and new technologies, Mookie is a member of [[FiRE]] (Future in Review) an annual event that gathers one hundred people from all over the world to discuss the likely penetration of the latest technological innovations and their impact on a not so far away future. He also founded United Virtualities, a company of on-line systems, and created over twenty on-line technologies, such as Ooqa Ooqa (Explorer's enhanced native toolbar), Schvitzer (an intelligent text highlighter), and Yachne (a 3D animated messenger).

His art piece "Paranoia" was awarded the highest prize in 2008 official [[Salón Nacional de Bellas Artes]] the most prestigious award in Argentina.

Recently he was featured on [[CNN]]'s "[[Cala (TV series)|Cala]]".

His works have been the object of numerous individual and collective in his native Argentina, and abroad.

Concurrently, Tenembaum's philosophical work started with a virulent critique of "Illusions", which is the term he uses to dub States, Religions, Families and other such juridical persons. His, is a deconstructive critique revolving around the fundamental claim that these Illusions are nothing but onerous fever phantasms spawned by each physical person's terror of death, or ATD (after its Ancient Greek initials Auto-Thanatos-Deimia).

As of late, Tenembaum's system of Disillusionism has expanded into a wider discussion of human [[ethology]]. According to him, [[behavioral modernity]], depends not only upon ATD and Illusions, but also upon the neuro-physiology that explains pain, relief, pleasure, memory, anticipation and other rival contenders for the very limited [[attentional span]] of human animals. Furthermore, Disillusionism relies heavily upon negativity and discarding as driving forces behind both human evolution and common sense.

On a practical note, Tenembaum's philosophy also distinguishes animal aptitude from each individual's actual willingness to apply the abilities it possesses. Drawing a parallel with the ancestral [[pack hunter|packs]], in which a division of attention and tasks was biologically enforced amongst individuals, Disillusionism attempts to make sense of the exchanges and relationships inside each human individual's Egosphere, and discuses the part [[Common Sense]] might play in optimizing such organization.

Tenembaum is the father of five children and the eldest son of [[Baruch Tenembaum]], founder of the [[International Raoul Wallenberg Foundation]] and is a resident of Paraguay.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1953">In [[general relativity]] and [[tensor calculus]], the '''[[Attilio Palatini|Palatini]] identity''' is:

:&lt;math&gt; \delta R_{\sigma\nu} = \nabla_\rho (\delta \Gamma^\rho_{\nu\sigma}) - \nabla_\nu (\delta \Gamma^\rho_{\rho\sigma}),&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\delta \Gamma^\rho_{\nu\sigma}&lt;/math&gt; denotes the variation of [[Christoffel symbols]]&lt;ref name="christoffel" &gt;{{citation|title=Ueber die Transformation der homogenen Differentialausdrücke zweiten Grades|last=Christoffel|first=E.B.|author-link=Elwin Bruno Christoffel|journal=Journal für die reine und angewandte Mathematik|volume=B. 70|pages=46–70|year=1869|url=http://gdz.sub.uni-goettingen.de/dms/load/img/?PPN=GDZPPN002153882&amp;IDDOC=266356}}&lt;/ref&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\nabla_\rho&lt;/math&gt; indicates [[covariant differentiation]].

The "same" identity holds for the [[Lie derivative]] &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{L}_{\xi} R_{\sigma\nu}&lt;/math&gt;. In fact, one has:

:&lt;math&gt; \mathcal{L}_{\xi} R_{\sigma\nu} = \nabla_\rho (\mathcal{L}_{\xi} \Gamma^\rho_{\nu\sigma}) - \nabla_\nu (\mathcal{L}_{\xi} \Gamma^\rho_{\rho\sigma}),&lt;/math&gt;

{{Intellectual property}}
'''Paraphrasing of copyrighted material''' may reduce the probability that a court will find that [[copyright]] has been infringed; however, there have been many cases where a [[paraphrase]] that uses quite different words and sentence structure has been found to infringe on a prior work's copyright.

The acceptable degree of difference between a prior work and a paraphrase depends on a variety of factors and ultimately depends on the judgement of the court in each individual case.

==Legal traditions==

===Early years===
[[File:Zedler - Universal-Lexicon, Band 1 (Titelblatt).jpg|thumb|[[Johann Heinrich Zedler]]'s right to publish his ''[[Grosses vollständiges Universal-Lexicon|Universal-Lexicon]]'' was challenged on the grounds that an encyclopedia must always paraphrase other works.]]
An early example of the concept of paraphrasing as a copyright issue arose with [[Johann Heinrich Zedler]]'s application in 1730 for copyright protection in Saxony for his ''[[Grosses vollständiges Universal-Lexicon]]'', one of the first encyclopedias. 
The publisher of a rival ''General Historical Lexicon'' said that Zedler's ''Universal Lexicon'' would not differ in content from this and other existing lexicons apart from paraphrasing.{{sfn|Kirchhoff|1891|pp=198}}
On 16 October 1730, the Upper Consistory court in [[Dresden]] rejected Zedler's request, and warned that he would be subject to confiscation and a fine if he reproduced any material from the ''General Historical Lexicon'' in his ''Universal Lexicon''.{{sfn|Order against Zedler}}

Laws on the degree of copying or paraphrasing that is considered permissible have become steadily more restrictive over the years.
In his 2008 book ''Copyright's Paradox'', discussing the conflict between protecting copyright and protecting free speech,  Neil Netanel says, "Yeats [borrowed] from Shelley; Kafka from Kleist and Dickens; Joyce from Homer; and T.S. Eliot from Shakespeare, Whitman and Baudelaire, all in ways that would infringe today's bloated copyright."{{sfn|Saint-Amour|2011|p=31}}
Paraphrase may apply to music as well as to writing. It was commonplace for Baroque, Classical and Romantic composers to create variations on each other's work without permission.  This would not be allowed today.{{sfn|Patry|2012|p=100}}

Copyright protection in Britain dates back to the 1556 Charter of the [[Worshipful Company of Stationers and Newspaper Makers]].
The [[Licensing of the Press Act 1662]] gave publishers exclusive printing rights, but did not give any rights to authors.
Parliament failed to renew the act in 1694, primarily to remove monopoly and encourage a free press.
The [[Statute of Anne]] in 1710 prescribed a copyright term of fourteen years, and let the author renew for another fourteen years, after which the work went into the [[public domain]].
Over the years, additional acts and case law steadily refined the definitions of what could be protected, including derivative works, and the degree of protection given.{{sfn|Patterson|1993|pp=9ff}}

The Soviet Union's Copyright Act of 1925 in essence said that a work created by a minimal paraphrase of an existing text could be considered a new work eligible for copyright.{{sfn|Levitsky|1964|p=101}}
By 1991, the [[Copyright law of the Soviet Union]] had evolved to give much more protection to the author.
Free use, similar to the English [[common law]] concept of [[fair use]], was only allowed if it did not infringe upon the normal exploitation of the work or the legitimate interests of the author.{{sfn|Elst|2005|p=376}}

===Moral rights===

[[Moral rights (copyright law)|Moral rights]] are rights of creators of copyrighted works that are generally recognized in [[Civil law (legal system)|civil law]] jurisdictions and, to a lesser extent, in some [[common law]] jurisdictions. 
They include the right of [[attribution (copyright)|attribution]] and the right to the integrity of the work, which bars the work from alteration, distortion, or mutilation without the author's permission.  Paraphrasing without permission may be seen as violating moral rights. 
Moral rights are distinct from any economic rights tied to copyrights. 
Even if the author has assigned their copyright to a third party, they still maintain the moral rights to the work.{{sfn|Rajan|2006|p=41-42}}
Moral rights were first recognized in [[France]] and [[Germany]].{{sfn|Rigamonti|2006|p=355}}
They were included in the [[Berne Convention for the Protection of Literary and Artistic Works]] in 1928.{{sfn|Kwall|2010|p=37}}
While the [[United States]] became a signatory to the Berne convention in 1989, it does not completely recognize moral rights as part of [[copyright law]], which is seen as protecting commercial rights in intellectual property, but as part of other bodies of law such as defamation or unfair competition which protect the reputation of the author.{{sfn|Kwall|2010|pp=30ff}}
[[File:Edward Gibbon by Henry Walton cleaned.jpg|thumb|[[Edward Gibbon]] was more concerned about poor translations of his book than about copyright violations.]]
[[Edward Gibbon]] published the last three volumes of his masterpiece ''[[The History of the Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire]]'' in 1788, at a time when both copyright and moral rights were poorly enforced.
With a small private income, he was not dependent on sales but was more concerned about the damage to his reputation from poor translations, a form of paraphrasing.
He wrote, "The French, Italian and German translations have been executed with various success; but instead of patronizing, I should willingly suppress such imperfect copes which injure the character while they propagate the name of the author.  The Irish pirates are at once my friends and my enemies...."{{sfn|Gibbon|2006|p=171}}

By the start of the twentieth century, U.S. decisions on unfair competition found that representing as the author's work a version of the work that substantially departed from the original was a cause of action.{{sfn|Winn|2006|pp=126-127}}
Section §43(a) of the [[Lanham Act]], which protects brands and trademarks, also provides similar protection to laws based on moral rights.
For any goods or services, it bans false designation of origin or a false description or representation.{{sfn|Kwall|2010|p=30}}
In ''[[Gilliam v. American Broadcasting]]'' the British comedy group called ''[[Monty Python]]'' took action against the ABC network for broadcasting versions of their programs which had been correctly attributed to them but had been extensively edited, in part to remove content that their audience might consider offensive or obscene. 
The judgement of the [[United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit]] was in favor of ''Monty Python'', finding the cuts might be an "actionable mutilation" that violated the Lanham Act.{{sfn|Lumbard|1976}}

===Fair use===

In the United States, copyright was covered by common law until it was formalized in the [[Copyright Act of 1976]].
Section §107 of this act set out four "[[fair use]]" principles to be used in evaluating whether copyright had been infringed:
*the purpose and character of the use, including whether such use is of a commercial nature or is for nonprofit educational purposes;
*the nature of the copyrighted work;
*the amount and substantiality of the portion used in relation to the copyrighted work as a whole; and
*the effect of the use upon the potential market for or value of the copyrighted work.

These principles apply both to literal copies and to paraphrases.
Judges are required to consider these factors, but may also take others into consideration, and may choose what weight they apply to each factor.{{sfn|Barrett|2008|p=162ff}}
According to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit in ''[[Wainwright Securities v. Wall Street Transcript Corp]]'' (1977), "The fair use doctrine offers a means of balancing the exclusive rights of a copyright holder with the public's interest in dissemination of information affecting areas of universal concern, such as art, science and industry."{{sfn|Burleson Enterprises|2011}}
Claims of fair use in copying or paraphrasing are more likely to succeed when the work being copied is factual.  
In ''[[Harper &amp; Row v. Nation Enterprises]]'' the [[Supreme Court of the United States]] said, "the law generally recognizes a greater need to disseminate factual works than works of fiction or fantasy."{{sfn|Perle|Fischer|Williams|1999|p=13-30}}
However, the court went on to quote Gorman, ''Fact or Fancy? The Implications for Copyright'' (1982) which said, "[E]ven within the field of fact works, there are gradations as to the relative proportion of fact and fancy. One may move from sparsely embellished maps and directories to elegantly written biography. The extent to which one must permit expressive language to be copied, in order to assure dissemination of the underlying facts, will thus vary from case to case."{{sfn|O'Connor|1985}}

When ''[[The Nation]]'' magazine published excerpts of Ford's unpublished memoir describing his reason for pardoning Nixon, the Supreme Court ruled that copyright was infringed even though Ford was a public figure describing a public event.]]
Use of a work for critical commentary is generally considered fair, as long as the commentary is indeed about the substance or style of the original work.{{sfn|Port|Halpern|Nard|2011|p=132}}
Parody may be seen as a form of commentary, and to be effective must copy or paraphrase many of the elements of creative expression in the work being parodied.
Although courts have differed in the past about how closely a parody can copy an original work, the U.S. Supreme Court in ''[[Campbell v. Acuff-Rose Music, Inc.]]'' (1994) ruled strongly: "[P]arody has an obvious claim to [[Transformativeness|transformative]] value... Like less ostensibly humorous forms of criticism, it can provide social benefit, by shedding light on an earlier work, and in the process, creating a new one.  We thus line up with the courts that have held the parody, like other comment or criticism, may claim fair use under §107."{{sfn|Port|Halpern|Nard|2011|p=130–131}}

===Unpublished works===

Unpublished works have special status under both moral rights and copyright, since the author or copyright owner has the right to control first publication.
Publication of an excerpt or paraphrase of an unpublished work may infringe that right.
An author wishing to quote or even loosely paraphrase an unpublished work in France can only do so with permission from the author.{{sfn|Heins|Beckles|2005|p=17}}
In ''Harper &amp; Row v. Nation Enterprises'' (1985) the United States Supreme Court held that "under ordinary circumstances, the author's right to control the first public appearance of his undisseminated expression will outweigh a claim of fair use."{{sfn|Harper &amp; Row 1985}}

The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit in ''[[Salinger v. Random House]]'', which concerned a biography in which a number of unpublished letters by the subject had been paraphrased, similarly concluded that the copyright owner's right to control publication took precedence over "fair use", so even limited paraphrasing was unacceptable.{{sfn|SALINGER v. RANDOM HOUSE, INC 1987}}
This drew support from those concerned with the rights of an individual to privacy and criticism from those more interested in the public "right to know."{{sfn|McDowell|1987}}
In 1992 the Copyright Act was amended as a result of the ''Salinger'' case to include a sentence at the end of §107 saying that the fact that a work is unpublished "shall not itself bar a finding of fair use if such finding is made upon consideration" of all four fair-use factors.{{sfn|Perle|Fischer|Williams|1999|p=13-7}}

==Comparison approaches==

A paraphrase is a restatement of the meaning of a text or passage using other words.  Equivalent concepts apply to images or music.
In most countries, copyright applies to the original expression in a work rather than to the meanings or ideas being expressed.
A loose paraphrase of a portion of a work may therefore be published without violating copyright.{{sfn|Head|2006|p=243}}
If the paraphrase is so different that the expression in the derivative work has no similarity to that of the prior work, there is no infringement.{{sfn|Fishman|2011|p=284}} 
In ''[[See v. Durang]]'' (1983) the [[United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit]] found "Copying deleted or so disguised as to be unrecognizable is not copying."{{sfn|Browning|Choy|Ferguson|1983}}
But courts have struggled to find a clear method of comparing a paraphrase or derivative to a prior work to determine whether the copyright in the original expression has been infringed.

[[File:LearnedHand1910a.jpg|thumb|Judge [[Learned Hand]] gave a seminal description of the [[idea/expression dichotomy]] in his 1930 judgement on ''[[Nichols v. Universal Pictures Corporation]]''.]]
Philosophically, there is disagreement about the distinction between thought and language.
In the past it was often thought that the two could not be separated, and so a paraphrase could never exactly reproduce a thought expressed in different words.  
At the opposite extreme is the view that concepts and language are completely independent, so there is always a range of ways in which a concept can be expressed.{{sfn|Bently|Davis|Ginsburg|2010|p=190}}
Copyright law in common law countries tries to avoid theoretical discussion of the nature of ideas and expression such as this, taking a more pragmatic view of what is called the [[idea/expression dichotomy]].{{sfn|Bently|Davis|Ginsburg|2010|p=191-192}}
In ''[[Nichols v. Universal Pictures Corporation]]'' (1930), Judge [[Learned Hand]] of the [[United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit]] gave an explanation of the dichotomy that has often been cited by courts hearing copyright cases, and that illustrates the inherent subjectivity of any decision.{{sfn|Rooijen|2010|p=62-63}}
He said:
{{blockquote|Upon any work, and especially upon a play, a great number of patterns of increasing generality will fit equally well, as more and more of the incident is left out.  The last may perhaps be no more than the most general statement of what the play is about, and at times might consist only of its title; but there is a point in this series of abstractions where they are no longer protected, since otherwise the playwright could prevent the use of his "ideas," to which, apart from their expression, his property is never extended ... Nobody has ever been able to fix that boundary, and nobody ever can.{{sfn|Hand|1930}}}}

The plaintiff in a copyright case must show that there is "[[substantial similarity]]" between the alleged copy and the prior work.{{sfn|Sneed|1985}} 
In ''[[Roth Greeting Cards v. United Card Co]]'' (1970) the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit introduced the concept of "total concept and feel", holding that a work could be made up of elements that could not be copyrighted, but that the total concept and feel could be subject to copyright, and would be considered to be infringed if a normal reasonable person would consider that a disputed work was a copy of a prior work.{{sfn|Hamley|1970}}
This concept has been used in later cases such as ''[[Reyher v. Children's Television Workshop]]'' (1976), where two works derived from the same folk tale had similar plots.
The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit found that there had not been copying, since the different versions were very different in style and in detail, saying "the essence of infringement lies in taking not a general theme but its particular expression through similarities of treatment, details, scenes, events and characterization."{{sfn|Meskill|1976}}

The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit in ''[[Sid &amp; Marty Krofft Television Productions Inc. v. McDonald's Corp.]]'' (1977) refined the concept by establishing a two-stage comparison.
An extrinsic test would determine similarity of general ideas, while an intrinsic test would compare the particular expressions used.
Extrinsic similarity means that two works are substantially similar in their general ideas, which can be determined objectively by an expert.
Intrinsic similarity means they are substantially similar in their forms of expression, and this is the more subjective test.{{sfn|Sneed|1985}}
The second test should be made by an "ordinary reasonable person" rather than an expert.{{sfn|Nimmer|2008|p=509}}
Both must be true for an infringement to exist.{{sfn|Sneed|1985}}

==Sample court findings==

The ideas or facts in a work are not subject to copyright protection, but the "protected expression" is.
A paraphrase of a work may infringe on copyright if the "protected expression" in the paraphrase is similar to that in the prior work.
Many court cases have hinged on how "protected expression" is defined and how similarity is determined.
[[File:H. T. Marshall and Martin Thomas Manton in 1915 at the Becker-Rosenthal trial in New York City.jpg|thumb|300px|In ''[[Nutt v. National Institute Inc.]]'' (1929), Judge [[Martin Thomas Manton]] ''(pictured, right)'' ruled that even loose paraphrasing may infringe copyright.]]
One of the earliest cases was ''[[Baker v. Selden]]'' (1879).  Charles Selden had developed a new system of bookkeeping and in 1865 published a short book that described his system, with sample forms.  W.C.M. Baker, who had seen Selden's book, published a similar book in 1867 describing an improved version of the system. A suit claiming copyright infringement went to the U.S. Supreme Court in 1879.{{sfn|Samuelson|2005|p=2ff}} 
The Supreme court found that Selden's idea could not be protected since there was no patent, but his description or explanation of the system was protected by copyright law, and found that Baker's book was "in large and material part identical with and infringements of the books of Selden system."
The arguments and ruling differ from modern law in that there was no discussion of the expression, only of the close similarities in the ideas given in the two books.{{sfn|Samuelson|2005|p=18ff}}

In ''[[Nutt v. National Institute Inc.]]'' (1929), Nutt was prohibited from delivering in public and for profit lectures that were similar to lectures whose copyright was held by the National Institute for the Improvement of Memory.{{sfn|Standler|2009|p=13}}
The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit in this case found that the protected expression is more than the literal words but also includes the "association, presentation, and combination of the ideas and thought which go to make up the [author's] literary composition."{{sfn|American Law Book Company|1939|p=233}}
The court said "The infringement need not be a complete or exact copy. Paraphrasing or copying with evasion is an infringement, even though there may be little or no conceivable identity between the two."{{sfn|Manton|1929}}

Wainwright Securities was engaged in preparing in-depth analyses of public companies, and selling them to major investors. The Wall Street Transcript Corporation, publisher of the ''Transcript'' magazine, began to publish abstracts of the Wainwright reports.
In ''Wainwright Securities v. Wall Street Transcript Corp'' (1977) the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit noted that "news events" cannot be copyrighted, but found that "the Transcript appropriated almost verbatim the most creative and original aspects of the reports, the financial analyses and predictions."
The court said, "What is protected is the manner of expression, the author's analysis or interpretation of events, the way he structures his material and marshals facts, his choice of words and the emphasis he gives to particular developments."{{sfn|Mishler|1977}}
An example of very close paraphrasing in this case was:
:*Original: "And second, he says that likely to aid comparisons this year was the surprisingly limited extent to which Fiber Divisions losses shrank last year."
:*Paraphrase: "The second development likely to aid comparisons this year was the surprisingly limited extent to which the Fiber Division's losses shrank last year."{{sfn|Fishman|2011|p=285}} 
[[File:Richard Wright (escritor).jpg|thumb|In ''Wright v. Warner Books'' (1991) the court found that use of paraphrases and sparing excerpts from unpublished work by [[Richard Wright (author)|Richard Wright]] ''(pictured)'' was fair.]]
The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit in ''[[Salinger v. Random House]]'' (1987) found that an unauthorized biography by [[Ian Hamilton (critic)|Ian Hamilton]] had infringed copyright with paraphrases of passages from unpublished letters written by the subject, the well-known novelist [[J. D. Salinger]]. As an example, the court cited:
:*Original: "He looks to me like a guy who makes his wife keep a scrapbook for him" 
:*Paraphrase: "[Salinger] had fingered [Wilkie] as the sort of fellow who makes his wife keep an album of press clippings."  
Despite differences in wording and sentence structure, the court found this to be a close paraphrase of a highly original expression.{{sfn|Fishman|2011|p=287}}
In this case, the close paraphrasing was considered to contribute to the "amount and substantiality" of the material that had been copied - that is, paraphrasing is a form of copying.{{sfn|Saint-Amour|2011|p=222}}
The court also found that Hamilton's practice of including phrases like "Salinger says," or "he said" within his paraphrase could give readers of the biography the false impression that they had read Salinger's own words. They might therefore decide not to buy a collection of the original letters. The court found that this meant there would be a financial impact.
The court barred publication.{{sfn|SALINGER v. RANDOM HOUSE, INC 1987}}

The case of ''[[Wright v. Warner Books]]'' (1991) was superficially similar to ''Salinger''.
[[Margaret Walker]] wrote an unauthorized biography of [[Richard Wright (author)|Richard Wright]], best known for his  books ''[[Native Son]]'' and ''[[Black Boy]]'', 
in which she made "sparing  use" of excerpts from the subject's unpublished letters and journals.
Ellen Wright, Richard Wright's widow, sued the author and [[Warner Books]], the publisher.{{sfn|Gaines|1992|p=175}}
In one example, the book paraphrased as follows from an unpublished letter that Wright had written:
:*Original: "Ellen, Julia, and Rachel will be here on Tuesday: they'll stay for two days.  Don't know what will happen when they get here. I'm hoping for peace and quiet."
:*Paraphrase: "Early in 1960, Wright wrote to Margrit de Sabloniere that Ellen, Julia, and Rachel would be arriving for a two or three day visit. Wright said that he did not know what would happen when they arrived but that he was hoping for peace and quiet."
Despite the apparent similarity, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit ruled that copyright had not been infringed.
The paraphrasing was just "straightforward and factual reportage" of the "most basic and banal factual matter."{{sfn|Fishman|2011|p=286}}

==Exclusions==

There are cases where there is very little choice about how to express some fact or idea, so a copy or close paraphrase may be unavoidable.
In this case, the "[[Merger doctrine (copyright law)|merger doctrine]]" comes into play.
The fact or idea and the expression are seen as merged, and the expression cannot be protected.
The merger doctrine is typically applied only to factual information or scientific theories, not to imaginative works such as plays or novels where the author has a much broader choice of expression.{{sfn|Fishman|2011|p=288}}
The merger doctrine has been applied to the user interface design of computer software, where similarity between icons used by two different programs is acceptable if only a very limited number of icons would be recognizable by users, such as an image looking like a page to represent a document.{{sfn|Lai|2000|p=47}}
However, in 1994 a U.K. judge in ''Ibcos Computers v. Barclays Mercantile Finance'' cast doubt on the merger doctrine, saying he was not comfortable with the idea that "if there is only one way of expressing an idea that way is not the subject of copyright."{{sfn|Lai|2000|p=45}}
[[File:Richard Posner at Harvard University.jpg|thumb|Judge [[Richard Posner]] has argued that websites should be legally required to obtain permission before paraphrasing news sources.]]
The term "Scenes a faire" means "obligatory scene", a scene in a play that the audience "has been permitted to foresee and to desire from the progress of the action; and such a scene can never be omitted without a consequent dissatisfaction."  The term was applied to copyright law in ''[[Cain v. Universal Pictures]]'' (1942), where the [[United States District Court for the Southern District of California]] ruled that "... similarities and incidental details necessary to the environment or setting of an action are not the material of which copyrightable originality consists."{{sfn|Lai|2000|p=52}}
The concept has been used by U.S. and U.K. courts.{{sfn|Lai|2000|p=54}}
The term is used both in the sense of a scene that follows inevitably from a situation,
or a standard scene that is always included in a particular genre of work.{{sfn|Lai|2000|p=53}}
Another court said "Under the ... doctrine of ''[[scènes à faire]]'', courts will not protect a copyrighted work from infringement if the expression embodied in the work necessarily flows from a commonplace idea."{{sfn|Iyer|2012|p=53}}
The concept has been extended to computer software, where some aspects may be dictated by the problem to be solved, or may be standard programming techniques.{{sfn|Lai|2000|p=59}}

==Permission agreements==

Publishers may formally allow limited quotation but prohibit paraphrasing, since they do not want readers to mistake the paraphrase for the original work.
In this case they would prohibit alteration of the work in their permission agreement.  
Although paraphrasing may be considered [[fair use]] under copyright law it may be considered breach of contract when the author of the paraphrase has implicitly or explicitly accepted a permission agreement.{{sfn|Stim|2010|p=46}}

Judge [[Richard Posner]] has argued in his blog in favor of laws that require online sites to obtain permission from the copyright holder before linking to or paraphrasing copyrighted materials from newspapers.  His concern is that existing laws based on fair use may not provide sufficient protection to the newspapers, who are paying for expensive news collection while the websites essentially get a free ride.  Without greater protection, Judge Posner considers that the result of widespread paraphrasing of newspapers on internet sites could be a drastic reduction in the number of news-gathering sources.{{sfn|Posner|2009}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7121">In [[philosophy]] and [[religion]] '''''the passions''''' are the instinctive, emotional, primitive drives in a human being (including, for example, lust, anger, aggression and jealousy) which a human being must restrain, channel, develop and [[Sublimation (psychology)|sublimate]] in order to be possessed of wisdom. Passions in religion and philosophy have a different connotation from the popular concept of passion which is generally seen as a positive emotion. The philosophical notion of passion, in contrast, is identified with innate or biologically driven [[emotion]]al states regarded in ancient philosophies and the great religions as being the basis for [[seven deadly sins|deadly sins]] and seen as leading to various social and spiritual ills such as unstable relationships, broken marriages, lack of social integration, psychological disorders and other problems. In the philosophical tradition of [[Western culture|the west]] passion is often placed in opposition to [[reason]]. Reason is advocated in the control of passion, something seen as desirable and necessary for the development of a mature, civilized human being. This is achieved by the cultivation of virtue. [[Cardinal virtues|Four virtues]] in particular have long been seen as of especial value in this regard.

The majority of philosophies and religions advocate at the very least tempering the passions to keep them within acceptable bounds. However most of the great religions recommend both the restraint and the transformation of the passions to the point where they no longer arise. This is true of Christianity, Jainism, Buddhism, Islam and Hinduism. The institution of the [[monastery]] within various religions is a means by which human beings may temporarily or permanently seclude themselves from circumstances exacerbating the arising of passion and provide a supportive environment for doing spiritual work.

Contemporary philosopher [[Roberto Mangabeira Unger]] has developed a view of the passions that disassociates them from human nature, and instead gives them a formless life that serve in our noninstrumental dealings with each other. Rather than the guiding force behind our relations with the world, they organize and are organized around the need and danger that is at the heart of our relations with each other. In this way, Unger rejects the traditional view of the passions as something counter to reason and which are associated with certain expressions, rather he sees them at the service of reason and their expression formed within certain contexts.&lt;ref name="Unger 1986"&gt;{{cite book|last=Unger|first=Roberto Mangabeira|title=Passion: An Essay on Personality|year=1986|publisher=Free Press|location=New York|isbn=0-02-933180-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
The subject of the passions has long been a consideration in Western philosophy. According to European philosopher Michel Meyer, they have aroused harsh judgments as the representation of a force of excess and lawlessness in humanity that produces troubling, confusing paradoxes. Meyer sees philosophers as having treated the passions as a given expression of human nature, leaving the question of whether the passions "torture people because it blinds them, or, on the contrary, does it permit them to apprehend who and what we really are?"&lt;ref&gt;Michel Meyer, ''Philosophy and the Passions'', a translation of ''Le Philosophe et les passions'' *(Livre de poche), Penn State Press, 2000. Preface, introduction and translation by Robert F. Barsky, [http://www.psupress.org/books/titles/0-271-02031-8.html website]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Spinoza==
The seventeenth century Dutch philosopher [[Baruch Spinoza|Spinoza]] contrasted "action" with "passion," as well as the state of being "[[Action (philosophy)|active]]" with the state of being "passive." A passion, in his view, happened when external events affect us partially such that we have confused ideas about these events and their causes. A "passive" state is when we experience an emotion which Spinoza regarded as a "passivity of the soul."&lt;ref name=tws09dec4333/&gt; The body's power is increased or diminished. Emotions are bodily changes plus ideas about these changes which can help or hurt a human.&lt;ref name=tws09dec4333&gt;{{cite news
|author = Spinoza; R.H.M. Elwes (translator) 1883
|title = DEFINITIONS. ON THE ORIGIN AND NATURE OF THE EMOTIONS
|quote = By emotion I mean the modifications of the body, whereby the active power of the said body is increased or diminished, aided or constrained, and also the ideas of such modifications. N.B. If we can be the adequate cause of any of these modifications, I then call the emotion an activity, otherwise I call it a passion, or state wherein the mind is passive.

}}&lt;/ref&gt; It happens when the bodily changes we experience are caused primarily by external forces or by a mix of external and internal forces. Spinoza argued that it was much better for the individual himself to be the only adequate cause of bodily changes, and to act based on an adequate understanding of causes-and-effects with ideas of these changes logically related to each other and to reality. When this happened the person is "active," and Spinoza described the ideas as adequate. But most of the time, this does not happen, and Spinoza, along with [[Sigmund Freud|Freud]], saw emotions as more powerful than [[Rationalism|reason]]. Spinoza tried to live the life of reason which he advocated.&lt;ref name=tws9911&gt;{{cite news

'''Radicalization''' (or '''radicalisation''') is a process by which an individual, or group comes to adopt increasingly [[Extremism|extreme]] political, social, or religious ideals and aspirations that reject or undermine the [[status quo]] or contemporary ideas and expressions of the nation. The outcomes of radicalization are shaped by the ideas of the society at large; for example, radicalism can originate from a broad social consensus against progressive changes in society or from a broad desire for change in society. Radicalization can be both violent and nonviolent, although most academic literature focuses on radicalization into [[violent extremism]] (RVE).&lt;ref&gt;Borum, Randy. Radicalization into Violent Extremism I: A Review of Social Science Theories. Journal of Strategic Security. Vol. 4 Issue 4. (2011) pp. 7–36&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Schmid, A. P. | title="Radicalisation, De-Radicalisation, Counter-Radicalisation: A Conceptual Discussion and Literature Review" | url=https://icct.nl/publication/radicalisation-de-radicalisation-counter-radicalisation-a-conceptual-discussion-and-literature-review/ | publisher= The International Centre for Counter-Terrorism – The Hague (ICCT)}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are multiple pathways that constitute the process of radicalization, which can be independent but are usually mutually reinforcing.&lt;ref&gt;McCauley, C., Mosalenko, S. "Mechanisms of political radicalization: Pathways towards terrorism," Terrorism and Political Violence (2008). 416&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Royal Canadian Mounted Police. Radicalization: A Guide for the Perplexed. National Security Criminal Investigations. June 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

Radicalization that occurs across multiple reinforcing pathways greatly increases a group’s resilience and lethality. Furthermore, by compromising its ability to blend in with non-radical society and participate in a modern, national economy, radicalization serves as a kind of sociological trap that gives individuals no other place to go to satisfy their material and spiritual needs.&lt;ref&gt;Berman, Eli. Radical, Religious, and Violent: The New Economics of Terrorism. MIT Press, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

==Definitions==

There is no universally accepted definition of radicalization. Therefore, no one definition can be presented here. One of the difficulties with defining radicalization appears to be the importance of the context to determine what is perceived as radicalization. Therefore, radicalization can mean different things to different people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Schmid, A. P. | title=Radicalisation, De-Radicalisation, Counter-Radicalisation: A Conceptual Discussion and Literature Review | url=https://icct.nl/publication/radicalisation-de-radicalisation-counter-radicalisation-a-conceptual-discussion-and-literature-review/ | publisher= The International Centre for Counter-Terrorism – The Hague (ICCT)}}&lt;/ref&gt; Presented below is a list of definitions used by different governments.

===United Kingdom===

The [[UK Home Office]], [[MI5|MI5’s]] parent agency, defines radicalization as “The process by which people come to support [[terrorism]] and violent extremism and, in some cases, then join terrorist groups.” The MI5 report closes by saying that no single measure will reduce radicalization in the UK and that the only way to combat it is by targeting the at risk vulnerable groups and trying to assimilate them into society. This may include helping young people find jobs, better integrating immigrant populations into the local culture, and effectively reintegrating ex-prisoners into society.&lt;ref&gt;Behavioural Science Operational Briefing Note: Understanding radicalization and violent extremism in the UK. Report BSU 02/2008. Retrieved at: http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk/2008/aug/20/uksecurity.terrorism1&lt;/ref&gt;

===Canada===

The [[Royal Canadian Mounted Police]] defines radicalization as "the process by which individuals—usually young people—are introduced to an overtly ideological message and belief system that encourages movement from moderate, mainstream beliefs towards extreme views. While radical thinking is by no means problematic in itself, it becomes a threat to national security when Canadian citizens or residents espouse or engage in violence or direct action as a means of promoting political, ideological or religious extremism. Sometimes referred to as “homegrown terrorism,” this process of radicalization is more correctly referred to as domestic radicalization leading to terrorist violence.&lt;ref&gt;Royal Canadian Mounted Police. Radicalization: A Guide for the Perplexed. National Security System (NSS). June 2009&lt;/ref&gt;”

===Denmark===
The [[Danish Security and Intelligence Service]] (PET) defines radicalization as “A process by which a person to an increasing extent accepts the use of undemocratic or violent means, including terrorism, in an attempt to reach a specific political/ideological objective.”&lt;ref&gt;PET, “Radikalisering og terror” Center for Terroranalyse (Denmark) October 2009. Available at http://www.pet.dk/upload/radikalisering{{dead link|date=April 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} og terror.pdf”&lt;/ref&gt;

== Diversity and commonalities ==

Despite being composed of multifarious pathways that lead to different outcomes and sometimes diametrically opposed ideological purposes, radicalization can be traced to a common set of pathways that translate real or perceived grievances into increasingly extreme ideas and readiness to participate in political action beyond the status quo. Shira Fishman, a researcher at the [[National Consortium for the Study of Terrorism and Responses to Terrorism]], wrote "Radicalization is a dynamic process that varies for each individual, but shares some underlying commonalities that can be explored."&lt;ref&gt;Fishman, Shira., et al. UMD START: Community-Level Indicators of Radicalization: A Data and Methods Task Force. 16 February 2010&lt;/ref&gt; Though there are many end products of the process of radicalization, to include all manner of extremist groups both violent and nonviolent, a common series of dynamics have been consistently demonstrated in the course of academic inquiry.

==Islamic radicalization==
[[Jihadis]] have a "tried and tested model" of contact with different [[Vulnerability|vulnerable]], and [[extremist]] individuals through online messaging services or [[social media]] platforms, and then rapidly manipulating them towards participating in violent action in their name.&lt;ref name="Jones2017"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Jones|first1=Sam|last2=Wright|first2=Robert|title=Police probe how family man Khalid Masood became a violent zealot|url=https://www.ft.com/content/c20027e8-0ff3-11e7-a88c-50ba212dce4d|accessdate=March 24, 2017|publisher=Financial Times|date=March 23, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It was reported that [[Raffia Hayat]] of the [[Ahmadiyya Muslim association]] warned that jailed extremists attempt to recruit violent criminals into radical groups so they carry out attacks on the public once released.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Wood|first1=Vincent|title=British Muslim leader says May MUST crack down on prison radicalisation to beat terror|url=http://www.express.co.uk/news/uk/783721/Khalid-Masood-Prison-Radicalised-Theresa-May-jihadi-Ahmadiyya-Muslim-Association|accessdate=March 26, 2017|agency=Sunday Express|date=March 25, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; There have been several notable criticisms of radicalization theories for focusing disproportionately on Islam.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Kundnani |first1=Arun |date=2012 |title=Radicalization: the journey of a concept |url=http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0306396812454984 |journal=Race &amp; Class |volume=54 |issue=2 |pages=3–25 |doi=10.1177/0306396812454984}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There have been concerns that converts to Islam are more susceptible to violent radicalization than individuals born into the faith.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/voices/westminster-london-terror-attack-terrorist-khalid-masood-convert-muslim-islam-extremism-a7647626.html|title=Why are converts to Islam more likely to become extremists?|date=2017-03-24|work=The Independent|access-date=2018-06-03|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/muslim-converts-vulnerable-radicalisation-extremism-terror-attacks-isis-henry-jackson-society-report-a8017981.html|title=Muslim converts 'vulnerable to Isis radicalisation', research finds|work=The Independent|access-date=2018-06-03|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.economist.com/britain/2017/04/01/converts-to-islam-are-likelier-to-radicalise-than-native-muslims|title=Converts to Islam are likelier to radicalise than native Muslims|website=The Economist|language=en|access-date=2018-06-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dr. Abdul Haqq Baker developed the '''Convert's Cognitive Development Framework''' that describes how new converts conceptualize Islam and the stages where they are most vulnerable to radicalization.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/709890472|title=Extremists in our midst : confronting terror|last=1966-|first=Baker, Abdul Haqq,|date=2011|publisher=Palgrave Macmillan|year=|isbn=9780230296541|location=Houndmills, Basingstoke, Hampshire|pages=12|oclc=709890472}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mutual aid==

[[Eli Berman]]'s 2009 book ''Radical, Religious, and Violent: the New Economics of Terrorism''&lt;ref&gt;Radical, Religious and Violent: The New Economics of Terrorism (MIT Press 2009)&lt;/ref&gt; applies a [[rational choice]] model to the process of radicalization, demonstrating that the presence of [[mutual aid (organization theory)|mutual aid]] networks increase the [[Resilience (organizational)|resilience]] of radical groups. When those groups decide to use violence, they also enjoy a heightened level of lethality and are protected from [[defection]] and other forms of intervention by states and outside groups.

All organizations insofar as they include the possibility of [[free rider problem|free riders]] by extension experience defection constraints. Within the context of a violent extremist organization, defection means either defection to a [[counterintelligence]] or [[security]] apparatus, or defection to a non-radical [[criminal]] apparatus. Both of these outcomes spoil specific plans to exercise violence in the name of the group at large. The “defection constraint” is similar to a [[threshold price-point]] in that it denotes what rewards would justify the defection of any one individual within the context of an [[organization]]. Berman uses the example of a Taliban protection racket for convoys of consumer goods moving through Afghanistan: checkpoints are set up at several points along a trade route, and each checkpoint’s team is given a small percentage of the convoy’s total value if it arrives safely at its destination. The incentive for any one checkpoint’s team deciding to simply hijack a convoy as it passes through, sell the goods off, and escape, increases as the value of the convoy increases. The same dynamic applies to attacks; while an individual in a terrorist group may not feel drawn by the reward of alerting the police to an impending low level crime, the reward for alerting the police to an impending high-profile attack, such as a mass bombing, becomes more attractive. While non-radicalized and criminal organizations can only rely on organizational cohesion through a calculus of greed, fear, and perhaps familial loyalty, Berman argues that religious radicalization greatly increases the defection constraints of radical terrorist organizations by requiring outsized demonstrations of commitment to the cause prior to recruiting operatives.

Mutual aid is the voluntary and reciprocal exchange of goods within an organization. Examples in various religious antecedents include Judaic [[Tzedakah]], Islamic [[Zakat]], and various Christian institutions of charity, as described in the [[Acts of the Apostles]]. Berman argues that religious organizations experience economic risks by extending mutual aid to all alleged believers—theological assent is cheap, action can be costly. By imposing a series of outwardly visible social rules, such as restrictions (or prescriptions) on dress, diet, language, and social interactions, groups impose a cost on entering into a mutual aid partnership, diminishing the occurrence of free riding.

These restrictions have a dual effect in radical groups. Not only do they ensure that an individual is committed to the cause, but they also diminish individual’s access to consumption opportunities and social interaction that might persuade them to distance themselves from the cause. As individuals become more involved with radical activities, their social circles become more constrained, which diminishes contact with non-radicalized persons and further entrenches radicalized thinking. For example, when a young man spends several years in a Yeshiva in order to establish himself within a [[Haredi]] community, he foregoes future earnings that would be accessible should he choose a secular education. To quote Berman “As consumption opportunities are limited, work for pay becomes less appealing, freeing up even more time for community activities.” This [[sunk cost]] figures into future calculations, and raises the defection constraint in a way that non-radicalized group dynamics cannot. Going back to the Taliban convoy example, not only have the two footsoldiers in question have been [[vetted]] by demonstrating commitment to the cause, they also have had their exterior options limited such that it would be difficult to blend into a new environment for lack of skills and cultural understanding. As such, the threshold price point to defect, as represented by the value of the convoy, increases to include both the price of losing their existing support network and non-quantifiable factors such as friends, family, safety, and other goods over the course of their lives.

==Individual pathways==

While the overall arch of radicalization usually involves multiple, reinforcing processes, scholars have identified a series of individual pathways to radicalization. Clark McCauley and Sofia Mosalenko’s 2009 book ''Friction: How Radicalization Happens to Them and Us'' identifies the following sociological and psychodynamic pathways:

===Individual-level factors===

==== Personal grievance ====
This pathway emphasizes revenge for real or perceived harm inflicted upon oneself by an outside party. This initial offense triggers other psychodynamic mechanisms, such as thinking in more stark in-group and out-group terms, lowered inhibitions to violence, and lessened incentives to avoid violence. Chechen “[[Shahidka]]” also known as Black Widows, women who have lost husbands, children, or other close family members in conflict with Russian forces are a good example.

==== Group grievance ====
"Group grievance" radicalization dynamics are similar to those that are primed by personal grievances; the difference is that the subject perceives harm inflicted on a group that she belongs to or has sympathy for. This pathway accounts for the larger portion of political and ethnic radical violence, in which action is taken on behalf of the group at large rather than as an act of personal revenge. Radicalization out of sympathy for an outgroup is rarer, but can be observed in the Weather Underground's attempted alignment with the [[Black Panthers]] and [[Viet Cong]]. The tie between radicalization into [[violent extremism]] through group grievance and [[suicide bombing]] has also been quantifiably demonstrated: perceived threats to proximal identity such as the presence of foreign troops or invasion accounts for the majority of suicide bombings.&lt;ref&gt;Pape, Robert., Feldman, James. ''Cutting the Fuse: The Explosion of Global Suicide Terrorism and How to Stop It''. University of Chicago Press, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Slippery slope ====
The "Slippery slope" represents gradual radicalization through activities that incrementally narrow the individual’s social circle, narrow their mindset, and in some cases desensitize them to violence. This has also been called the “True Believer” syndrome, as a product of which one becomes increasingly serious about their political, social, and religious beliefs as a product of “taking the next step”. One can begin by participating in nonviolent activities such as mutual aid, wherein the best way to raise one’s in-group social status is to demonstrate seriousness about the cause and increase the level of commitment in terms of beliefs and activities. As an individual commits act after act, sunk costs are developed. Even if activity is initially only ideological or only criminal, the process of radicalization conflates the two such that criminal acts are justified for intellectually radical purposes, and radical purposes are invoked to justify what are ultimately criminal acts.&lt;ref&gt;Post, Jerrold. "Notes on a Psychodynamic Theory of Terrorist Behavior," in ''Terrorism: An International Journal'' Vol. 7 No. 3. 1984&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Love ====
Romantic and familial entanglement is often an overlooked factor in radicalization. Several violent extremist organizations, especially at their origin, owe their structure to a tight-knit group of friends who share religious, economic, social, and sexual bonds. While this example is evident in more extreme cases, such as those of [[Charles Manson]]'s "Family" and other radical [[cult]]s, it also applies to radicalization in secular and orthodox religious environments. Love can serve as a connection between influential figures, connecting their networks of followers through a combination of attraction and loyalty.&lt;ref&gt;Della Porta, D. Social movements, political violence, and the state: A comparative analysis of Italy and Germany. Cambridge University Press. 1995&lt;/ref&gt; This particular force was especially notable in [[New Left]] radical groups, such as the American [[Weather Underground]] and the German [[Red Army Faction]]. The connections between [[Bill Ayers]] and [[Bernardine Dohrn]], or between [[Gudrun Ensslin]] and [[Andreas Baader]] served as the organizational and intellectual nucleus of these groups.

==== Risk and status ====
Within a radical group, high-risk behavior, if successful, offers a pathway to status insofar as it becomes re-construed as bravery and commitment to the cause. As such, violence or other radical activity provides a pathway to success, social acceptance, and physical rewards that might otherwise be out of reach. {{quotation | Disproportionate involvement in risk taking and status seeking is particularly true of those young men who come from disadvantaged family backgrounds, have lower IQ levels, are of lower socioeconomic status, and who therefore have less opportunity to succeed in society along a traditional career path. These young men are more likely to be involved in gang activity, violent crime, and other high-risk behavior.&lt;ref&gt;McCauley, C. Mosalenko, S. Friction: How Radicalization Happens to Them and Us. Oxford University press 2009. pp. 62–63&lt;/ref&gt;}}

James Pugel conducted a study, in which Liberian ex-combatants, indicated their motivations to become radicalized were based on the opportunity to increase their economic and social status within their community. There was a belief that radicalized individuals lived better than non-radicalized individuals. Specifically, extremists groups offered compensatory employment, which provided the means for basic needs to be met such as food and housing.In addition, radicalization provided protection and safety from local violence (i.e. abductions) for their entire family. All of which are contributory to the notion of an elevated economic and social status within the community.&lt;ref&gt;Pugel, James. "What the Fighters Say: A Survey of Ex-combatants in Liberia: February - March 2006". United Nations Development Programme, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

Other researchers such as Alpaslan Ozerdem and Sukanya Podder contend that radicalization “can become the only route to survival, offering protection from torture, abuse, and politically instigated killing."&lt;ref&gt;Ozerdem, Alpaslan and Sukanya Podder. "Youth Radicalization and Violent Extremism". Journal of Strategic Security, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; It is worth noting that in some cases, individuals that did not join, were subjected to an indefinite “insufferable social burden that included demeaning names and labels".&lt;ref&gt;Barrett, Robert. "Interviews with Killers: Six Types of Combatants and Their Motivations for Joining Deadly Groups". Studies in Conflict and Terrorism, 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Unfreezing ====
Loss of social connection can open an individual to new ideas and a new identity that may include political radicalization. Isolated from friends, family, or other basic needs, individuals may begin to associate with unlike parties, to include political, religious, or cultural radicals. This is especially noted in ''prison radicalization'', where individuals bind together over racial, religious, and gang identity to a greater degree than in the outside world and often bring their newfound radical identity beyond prison to connect with radical organizations in the populace at large.&lt;ref&gt;Fighel, John. "The Radicalization Process in Prisons", ''International Institute for Counterterrorism''. presented at NATO workshop, Eliat, 25 December 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Additional Pathways ====
Robert Barrett is one of the leading researchers in field research with Nigerian terrorist groups. Barrett contributes a unique perspective to this type of research because his studies are conducted with current, not former, members of insurgent groups. Barrett’s 2008 field research study revealed unique typologies and motivations for radicalization as reported by insurgent groups. For instance, individuals that were radicalized expressed sentiments of volunteerism, yet extremist recruiters conveyed that their objective was to make “coercion feel like volunteerism.” Barrett asserted that the motivations to become radicalized can be characterized as: ideologue, combatant, criminals, pragmatist, soldier, and follower.&lt;ref&gt;Barrett, Robert. "Interviews with Killers: Six Types of Combatants and Their Motivations for Joining Deadly Groups". Studies in Conflict and Terrorism, 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

Ideologues uphold a belief that ethnic supremacy is necessary and violence was the means to achieve this truth. Ideologues maintain a “readiness to die for the ethnic group if necessary; survival and preservation of the group or community is more important than survival or preservation of oneself”.

Combatants’ express concerns that their basic survival depends on joining extremist groups. Hence, combatants are not motivated by ideologies and their primary objective is self-preservation.

Criminals are predominantly motivated by their “freedom to carry out activities that would otherwise be deemed illegal”. As such, criminals thrive on instant self-gratification of engaging in violent acts against their enemies. Criminals thrive on conflict and in a sense believe their actions are heroic.

Pragmatists are interested in the benefits of economic and social status mobility. Their goals are in “preserving the structures and environment conducive to either continued success or to newfound success” in wealth, land ownership, and/or mining rights.

Soldiers believe “injustice and insecurity” are mitigating factors for radicalization. Prominent feelings that they have a duty to fight against injustices. Soldiers are motivated by a sense that they can instrumentally affect positive change.

Followers desire a sense of group dependence and attachment to overcome feelings of being an outsider. They are overwhelmingly concerned with social perception. “Ensuring one’s acceptance and preserving or enhancing one’s social status within the community was the most important factor promoting membership”.

===Group-level factors===

Insofar as a group is a dynamic system with a common goal or set of values it is possible that the group’s mindset as a whole can affect individuals such that those individuals become more radical.

==== Polarization ====
Discussion, interaction, and experience within a radical group can result in an aggregate increase in commitment to the cause, and in some cases can contribute to the formation of divergent conceptions of the group’s purpose and preferred tactics. Within a radical group, internal dynamics can contribute to the formation of different factions as a result of internal disillusionment (or, conversely, ambitions) with the group’s activities as a whole, especially when it comes to a choice between violent terrorism and nonviolent activism. The [[Weather Underground]]’s split with [[Students for a Democratic Society]] is one of many examples. The dynamics of group polarization imply that members of this larger group must either commit to one faction and demonstrate their loyalty through further radicalization, or leave the group entirely.

==== Isolation ====
Isolation reinforces the influence of radical thinking by allowing serious and or persuasive members of the group to disproportionately define the body's agenda. When an individual only has access to one in-group social environment, that group gains a totalizing influence over the individual—disapproval would be tantamount to social death, personal isolation, and often a lack of access to the basic services that mutual aid communities fulfill. As an isolated minority, Islamic groups in the West are especially vulnerable to this form of radicalization. Being cut off from society at large through [[language barrier]]s, cultural difference, and occasionally [[discriminatory]] treatment, Muslim communities become more vulnerable to additional pathways of radicalization&lt;ref&gt;Vidino, Lorenzo. ''Countering Radicalization in America: Lessons from Europe''. United States institute of Peace Special Report, Nov. 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

One such additional pathway of radicalization of individuals that feel isolated is the Internet. Utilizing data compiled by the Internet World Stats, Robin Thompson contends that the Middle East and North Africa rate of Internet usage is “above average” in comparison to other countries, yet in countries where Internet availability is more widespread, individuals are “more likely to be recruited and radicalized via the Internet.” Hence, the Internet, specifically social media sites such as extremists’ chat rooms and blogs, “lures its users with a promise of friendship, acceptance, or a sense of purpose.”&lt;ref&gt;Thompson, Robin L. "Radicalization and the Use of Social Media". Journal of Strategic Security, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Competition ====
Groups can become radicalized vis-a-vis other groups as they compete for [[legitimacy (political)|legitimacy]] and prestige with the general populace. This pathway emphasizes increased radicalization in an effort to outdo other groups, whether that increase is in violence, time spent in religious ritual, economic and physical hardship endured, or all four. Religious movements and the terrorist elements that form in their name display this characteristic. {{citation needed|date=May 2015}} While in some cases there may be [[doctrinal]] or [[ethnic]] differences that motivate this kind of competition, its greatest outward sign is an increased demand by the group for commitment to radical actions. {{citation needed|date=May 2015}}

===Mass radicalization===
[[File:Mao1938a.jpg|thumb|right|Chairman [[Mao Zedong]] writing ''On Protracted War'' in 1938.]]

==== Jujitsu politics ====
Also called "the logic of political violence", Jiujitsu politics is a form of [[Asymmetric warfare|asymmetrical]] [[political warfare]] in which radical groups act to provoke governments to crack down on the populace at large and produce domestic blowback that legitimates further violent action.&lt;ref&gt;McCauley, C. Jiutitsu Politics: Terrorism and response to terrorism. In P.R. Kimmel &amp; Chris Stout (Eds.), ''Collateral Damage: The psychological consequences of America's War on Terrorism''&lt;/ref&gt; The primary purpose of a radical group using this tactic is not to destroy the enemy outright, but to make the enemy strike at political and ideological moderates, such that the existing political order loses its claim on [[legitimacy (political)|legitimacy]] while the radical group gains legitimacy.&lt;ref&gt;Rosebraugh, Craig. The Logic of Political Violence. PW Press. Portland, OR. 2004&lt;/ref&gt; By destroying moderates, radical groups encourage a bifurcated society and use state's reactions to violence as a justification for further violence.&lt;ref&gt;Marighella, C. Minimanual of the Urban Guerrilla. J. Butt and R. Sheed (trans.) Havana, Transcontinental Press.&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Al-Qaeda]]'s strategy of luring the West, specifically the [[United States]], into ground wars in Islamic states that polarize the [[Ummah]] against the West while avoiding engagements that would allow the American military to draw on its technical superiority is an example of jiujitsu politics. [[David Kilcullen]], Counterinsurgency advisor to [[David Petraeus]] during the [[Iraq Surge]], has called this the "accidental guerrilla syndrome".&lt;ref&gt;KilCullen, David. ''The Accidental Guerrilla: Fighting Small Wars in the Midst of a Big One''. Oxford University Press. 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

This tactic is also pillar of [[Maoist]] [[insurgency]] and serves both the purposes of tactical and ideological advantage.

==== Hatred ====
In protracted conflicts the enemy is increasingly seen as less human,&lt;ref&gt;Royzman, E.E., McCauley, C., Rozin, P. From Plato to Putnam: Four ways of thinking about hate. In R.J. Sternberg (ed.) ''The Psychology of Hate'' pp. 3–35. (2005)&lt;/ref&gt; such that their common humanity does not readily trigger natural inhibitions against violence. This involves "essentializing" both the self and enemies as respectively good and evil entities. The Islamist use of [[Takfirism]], or ([[apostasy]]), to justify the murder of non-radical Muslims and nonbelievers (''[[kafir]]'': "pagans") is an example of this. [[Hannah Arendt]], in [[The Origins of Totalitarianism]] outlines a similar dynamic that contributed to the ideologies of [[pan-slavism]], [[Nazism]], and [[antisemitism]], where an [[in-group]] constructs an exalted [[self identity]] for political purposes and mobilizes against out-groups in order to solidify that identity.&lt;ref&gt;Arendt, Hannah. ''The Origins of Totalitarianism''. Schocken Books. 1951.&lt;/ref&gt; This dynamic of hatred is not unique to [[rightist]] groups. The Weathermen and Red Army Faction often characterized police officers and government officials as “pigs” worthy of death and subhuman treatment.

==== Martyrdom ====
[[Martyrdom]] implies that the person in question died for a cause or is willing to die for a cause. The symbolic impact of martyrdom varies across cultures, but within the field of radicalization the act or pursuit of martyrdom denotes the absolute value of a radical’s way of life.

==Misconceptions==

=== Poverty ===
The association between radicalization and poverty is a myth. Many terrorists come from middle-class backgrounds and have university-level educations, particularly in the technical sciences and engineering.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.economist.com/node/17730424 |title=Exploding misconceptions |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date=16 December 2010 |website=The Economist |access-date=7 October 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; There is no statistical association between poverty and militant radicalization.&lt;ref&gt;Baylouni, A.M. ''Emotion, Poverty, or Politics? Misconceptions About radical Islamist Movements''. Connections III, No. 1, Vol. 4. pp. 41–47 Available at: http://faculty.nps.edu/ambaylou/baylouny%20emotions%20poverty%20politics.PDF&lt;/ref&gt; As outlined above, poverty and disadvantage may incentivize joining a mutual aid organization with radical tendencies, but this does not mean that poverty proper is responsible for radicalization.

=== Mental illness ===
Though personal psychology does play a significant part in radicalization, mental illness is not a root cause of terrorism specifically or ideological radicalization broadly. Even in the case of [[suicide terrorism]], psychological pathologies, such as depression and [[schizophrenia]] are largely absent.&lt;ref&gt;Pape, Robert. ''Dying to Win: The Strategic Logic of Suicide Terrorism''. Random House. 2005. https://www.amazon.com/Dying-Win-Strategic-Suicide-Terrorism/dp/1400063175&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Pape, Robert., Feldman, James.

'''Real Snail Mail''' is a webmail service created by artists Vicky Isley and Paul Smith aka [[boredomresearch]], which uses real live snails equipped with Radio Frequency Identification ([[RFID]]) tags to deliver electronic messages. The project was [[Commission (art)|commissioned]]  as part of the Tagged Exhibition in Space Media Arts, London in 2006 &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.we-make-money-not-art.com/archives/2006/10/realsnailmail-e.php Real snail email - we make money not art&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.livescience.com/technology/061013_snail_mail.html Snail Mail with Real Snails | LiveScience&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; and was developed during boredomresearchs’ research fellowship in the Computer Animation Research Centre at [[Bournemouth University]]. 

The installation version of Real Snail Mail was displayed at [[SIGGRAPH]]08 in [[Los Angeles]] (11–15 August 2008), at the British Science Festival (14–19 September 2009), and at [DAM]Berlin as part of boredomresearch’s solo exhibition, ‘Chasing Stillness’ (29 August - 24 October 2009).

== How it works ==

Each snail "agent" is fitted with a [[RFID]] tag on its shell.
Users of the service send a message via the Real Snail Mail website which is routed to the tank to await collection by a snail "agent".
As the snails wander around the tank, they come into range of a RFID reader, which assigns the e-mail message to the RFID tag.
The references to the electronic messages are then physically carried around the tank by the snails until one of them passes close to a second reader.
As soon as this happens, the second reader triggers the message to be forwarded over the net in the usual way.

==History==
Redress was founded in 1992 by Keith Carmichael, a British torture survivor who sought justice for how he had been treated while a prisoner in [[Saudi Arabia]] from November 1981 until March 1984. After his release, Carmichael found that while the existing [[non-governmental organization]]s advocated for the release of prisoners, provided medical attention, and operated safe havens, none existed to seek [[reparation (legal)|reparations]] under international law. Redress was founded to fill that gap.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.redress.org/about/who-we-are|title=About REDRESS|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Buddhists take '''refuge''' in the Three Jewels or Triple Gem (also known as the "Three Refuges").

The Three Jewels are:
* [[Gautama Buddha|the Buddha]], the fully enlightened one
* the [[Dharma]], the teachings expounded by the Buddha
* the [[Sangha (Buddhism)|Sangha]], the monastic order of Buddhism that practice the Dharma

Refuge is common to all major schools of Buddhism.  Pali texts employ the [[Hinduism|Brahmanical]] motif of a group of three refuges, as found in [[Rig Veda]] 9.97.47, Rig Veda 6.46.9 and [[Chandogya Upanishad]] 2.22.3-4.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Shults|first1=Brett|title=On the Buddha’s Use of Some Brahmanical Motifs in Pali Texts|journal=Journal of the Oxford Centre for Buddhist Studies|date=May 2014|volume=6|page=119|url=http://jocbs.org/index.php/jocbs/article/view/76/96}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Faith (saddha) ==

{{Main|Faith in Buddhism}}
Faith is an important teaching element in both [[Theravada]] and [[Mahayana]] traditions. In contrast to perceived Western notions of faith, faith in Buddhism arises from accumulated experience and [[reason]]ing.

In the ''[[Kalama Sutra]]'', the Buddha explicitly argues against simply following [[authority]] or [[tradition]], particularly those of religions contemporary to the Buddha's time.&lt;ref name="Soma"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.accesstoinsight.org/lib/authors/soma/wheel008.html|title=Kalama Sutta: The Buddha's Charter of Free Inquiry|date=4 February 2013|publisher=|deadurl=bot: unknown|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130204141603/http://www.accesstoinsight.org/lib/authors/soma/wheel008.html|archivedate=4 February 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  There remains value for a degree of trusting confidence and belief in Buddhism, primarily in the spiritual attainment and salvation or [[Enlightenment in Buddhism|enlightenment]]. Faith in Buddhism centres on belief in the Three Jewels.

== Precepts ==
{{Main |Five precepts}}

Lay followers often undertake five precepts in the same ceremony as they [[taking refuge|take the refuges]].{{sfn |Getz |2004 |page=673}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |title=Festivals and Calendrical Rituals |date=2004 |publisher=[[The Gale Group]] |encyclopedia=Encyclopedia of Buddhism |url=https://www.encyclopedia.com/religion/encyclopedias-almanacs-transcripts-and-maps/festivals-and-calendrical-rituals |archive-url=http://www.webcitation.org/71uE0BBbB |archive-date=24 August 2018 |dead-url=no |via=Encyclopedia.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Monks administer the precepts to the laypeople, which creates an additional psychological effect.{{sfn |Harvey |2000 |p=80}} The five precepts are:

# to refrain from killing;&lt;ref name="accesstoinsight.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.accesstoinsight.org/ptf/dhamma/sila/atthasila.html|title=The Eight Precepts: attha-sila|website=www.accesstoinsight.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="accesstoinsight.org1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.accesstoinsight.org/lib/authors/nanavara/uposatha.html|title=Uposatha Sila: The Eight-Precept Observance|website=www.accesstoinsight.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://en.dhammadana.org/dhamma/practice/8_precepts.htm|title=The 8 precepts|first=Dhamma|last=Sāmi|website=en.dhammadana.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

# to refrain from consuming intoxicants.&lt;ref name="accesstoinsight.org"/&gt;&lt;ref name="accesstoinsight.org1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;

In [[Early Buddhist Texts]], the role of the five precepts gradually developed. First of all, the precepts were combined with a declaration of faith in the triple gem (the Buddha, [[dhamma|his teaching]] and [[sangha|the monastic community]]).&lt;!--173--&gt; Next, the precepts developed to become the foundation of lay practice.&lt;!--173-4--&gt;{{sfn |Kohn |1994 |pp=173{{en dash}}4}} The precepts were seen a preliminary condition for the higher development of the mind.{{sfn |Terwiel |2012 |p=178}} At a third stage in the texts, the precepts were actually mentioned together with the triple gem, as though they were part of it. Lastly, the precepts, together with the triple gem, became a required condition for the practice of Buddhism, as lay people had to undergo a formal initiation to become a member of the Buddhist religion.{{sfn |Kohn |1994 |p=173}} When Buddhism spread to different places and people, the role of the precepts began to vary. In countries in which Buddhism was adopted as the main religion without much competition from other religious disciplines, such as Thailand, the relation between the initiation of a lay person and the five precepts has been virtually non-existent, and the taking of the precepts has become a sort of ritual cleansing ceremony. In such countries, people are presumed Buddhist from birth without much of an initiation. The precepts are often committed to by new followers as part of their installment, yet this is not very pronounced. However, in some countries like China, where Buddhism was not the only religion, the precepts became an ordination ceremony to initiate lay people into the Buddhist religion.{{sfn |Terwiel |2012 |pp=178{{en dash}}9, 205}}

A layperson who upholds the precepts is described in the texts as a "jewel among laymen".{{sfn |De Silva |2016 |page=63 }}

== Three Roots ==
{{Main|Three Roots}}
[[File:Three Jewels symbol colour.svg|thumb|Symbol of the Three Jewels|274x274px]]
In [[Tibetan Buddhism]] there are three refuge formulations, the ''Outer'', ''Inner'', and ''Secret'' forms of the Three Jewels. The 'Outer' form is the 'Triple Gem', (Sanskrit:''triratna''), the 'Inner' is the Three Roots and the 'Secret' form is the 'Three Bodies' or [[trikaya]] of a [[Buddhahood|Buddha]]. These alternative refuge formulations are employed by those undertaking [[Deity Yoga]] and other [[Vajrayana|tantric]] practices within the [[Tibetan Buddhist]] [[Vajrayana]] tradition as a means of recognizing [[Buddha Nature]].
{{Tibetan Buddhist Refuge Formulations}}

Three refuge motivation levels are: 1) suffering rebirth's fear motivates with the idea of happiness, 2) knowing rebirth won’t bring freedoms motivated by attaining nirvana, while 3) seeing other’s suffering motivates establishing them all in Buddhahood.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Rinpoche|first1=Patrul|title=Words of My Perfect Teacher: A Complete Translation of a Classic Introduction to Tibetan Buddhism (Sacred Literature)|publisher=Yale University Press|isbn=0-300-16532-3|pages=176–177|edition=2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Happiness is temporary, lifetimes are impermanent and ultimately refuge is taken until reaching unsurpassed awakening.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Dorje|first1=Choying Tobden|last2=Zangpo|first2=Ngawang|title=The Complete Nyingma Tradition from Sutra to Tantra, Books 1 to 10: Foundations of the Buddhist Path|date=June 2, 2015|publisher=Snow Lion|isbn=1-55939-435-8|pages=224–227|edition=First}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{clarify|date=March 2017}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9029">'''Risk society''' is the manner in which modern [[society]] organizes in response to [[risk]]. The term is closely associated with several key writers on [[modernity]], in particular [[Ulrich Beck]] and [[Anthony Giddens]].&lt;ref name=BeckRiskSociety&gt;
{{cite book
|author=Ulrich Beck
|title=Risk Society, Towards a New Modernity
|location=London
|publisher=Sage Publications
|year=1992 
|pages=260
}}
&lt;/ref&gt; The term was coined in the 1980s and its popularity during the 1990s was both as a consequence of its links to trends in thinking about wider modernity, and also to its links to popular discourse, in particular the growing [[environmentalism|environmental concerns]] during the period.&lt;ref&gt;Caplan, p.7.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Definition==
According to British sociologist [[Anthony Giddens]], a risk society is "a society increasingly preoccupied with the future (and also with safety), which generates the notion of risk,"&lt;ref&gt;Giddens and Pierson 1998, p.209.&lt;/ref&gt; whilst the German sociologist [[Ulrich Beck]] defines it as "a systematic way of dealing with hazards and insecurities induced and introduced by [[modernisation]] itself (Beck 1992:21)".&lt;ref name=BeckRiskSociety /&gt;

Beck (1992:50)&lt;ref name=BeckRiskSociety /&gt; defined modernization as,

{{Quote box
|quote = "surges of technological rationalization and changes in work and organization, but beyond that includes much more: the change in societal characteristics and normal biographies, changes in lifestyle and forms of love, change in the structures of power and influence, in the forms of political repression and participation, in views of reality and in the norms of knowledge. In social science's understanding of modernity, the plough, the steam locomotive and the microchip are visible indicators of a much deeper process, which comprises and reshapes the entire social structure."
|width  = 75%
|align  = center
}}

==Background==

===Modernity and realism in science===
Beck and Giddens both approach the risk society firmly from the perspective of [[modernity]], "a shorthand term for modern society or industrial civilization...  modernity is vastly more dynamic than any previous type of social order. It is a society... which unlike any preceding culture lives in the future rather than the past." (Anthony Giddens)&lt;ref&gt;Giddens and Pierson p.94.&lt;/ref&gt; They also draw heavily on the concept of [[Reflexivity (social theory)|reflexivity]], the idea that as a society examines itself, it in turn changes itself in the process. In classical industrial society, the modernist view is based on assumption of realism in science creating a system in which scientists work in an exclusive, inaccessible environment.

==Implications==

===Environmental risks===
In 1986, right after the [[Chernobyl disaster]], Ulrich Beck, a sociology professor at the University of Munich, published the original German text, ''Risikogesellschaft'', of his highly influential and catalytic work (Suhrkamp, Frankfurt 1986). ''Risikogesellschaft'' was published in English as ''Risk Society: Towards a New Modernity'' in 1992. The ecological crisis is central to this social analysis of the contemporary period. Beck argued that environmental risks had become the predominant product, not just an unpleasant, manageable side-effect, of industrial society.

Giddens and Beck argued that whilst humans have always been subjected to a level of risk – such as [[natural disasters]] – these have usually been perceived as produced by non-human forces. Modern societies, however, are exposed to risks such as [[pollution]], newly discovered illnesses, crime, that are the result of the [[modernization]] process itself. Giddens defines these two types of risks as [[external risk]]s and [[manufactured risks]].&lt;ref&gt;Giddens, 1999.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Manufactured risks]] are marked by a high level of [[human agency]] involved in both producing, and mitigating such risks.

As [[manufactured risks]] are the product of human activity, authors like Giddens and Beck argue that it is possible for societies to assess the level of risk that is being produced, or that is about to be produced. This sort of reflexive introspection can in turn alter the planned activities themselves. As an example, disasters such as [[Chernobyl]] and the [[Love Canal]] Crisis, public faith in the modern project has declined leaving public distrust in [[industry]], [[government]] and [[expert]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Giddens, 1990.&lt;/ref&gt;

Social concerns led to increased regulation of the nuclear power industry and to the abandonment of some expansion plans, altering the course of modernization itself. This increased critique of modern industrial practices is said to have resulted in a state of [[reflexive modernization]], illustrated by concepts such as [[sustainability]] and the [[precautionary principle]] that focus on preventative measures to decrease levels of risk.

There are differing opinions as to how the concept of a risk society interacts with social hierarchies and class distinctions.&lt;ref&gt;Caplan, p.6.&lt;/ref&gt; Most agree that social relations have altered with the introduction of manufactured risks and reflexive modernization. [[Risk]]s, much like [[wealth]], are distributed unevenly in a population and will influence quality of life.

[[Ulrich Beck|Beck]] has argued that older forms of class structure – based mainly on the accumulation of wealth – atrophy in a modern, risk society, in which people occupy [[social risk positions]] that are achieved through risk aversion. "In some of their dimensions these follow the inequalities of class and strata positions, but they bring a fundamentally different distribution logic into play".&lt;ref&gt;Beck, p.23.&lt;/ref&gt; Beck contends that widespread risks contain a 'boomerang effect', in that individuals producing risks will also be exposed to them. This argument suggests that wealthy individuals whose [[Capital (economics)|capital]] is largely responsible for creating pollution will also have to suffer when, for example, the contaminants seep into the water supply. This argument may seem oversimplified, as wealthy people may have the ability to mitigate risk more easily by, for example, buying bottled water. [[Ulrich Beck|Beck]], however, has argued that the distribution of this sort of risk is the result of [[knowledge]], rather than wealth. Whilst the wealthy person may have access to [[factors of production|resources]] that enable him or her to avert risk, this would not even be an option were the person unaware that the risk even existed. However, Risks do not only affect those of a certain social class or place, risk is not bias and can affect everybody no matter your class, nobody is free from risk.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Risk Society: Towards a New Modernity|last=Beck|first=Ulrich|last2=Ritter|first2=Mark|publisher=Sage Publications|year=1992|isbn=978-0803983465|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By contrast, [[Anthony Giddens|Giddens]] has argued that older forms of class structure maintain a somewhat stronger role in a risk society, now being partly defined "in terms of differential access to forms of self-actualization and empowerment".&lt;ref&gt;Giddens 1991, p. 6.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Anthony Giddens|Giddens]] has also tended to approach the concept of a risk society more positively than [[Ulrich Beck|Beck]], suggesting that there "can be no question of merely taking a negative attitude towards risk. Risk needs to be disciplined, but active risk-taking is a core element of a dynamic economy and an innovative society."&lt;ref&gt;Giddens, ''Runaway World'', 1999, p.29.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Adhémar Jean Claude Barré de Saint-Venant|Barré de Saint-Venant]] derived the compatibility condition for  an arbitrary symmetric second rank [[tensor field]] to be of this form, this has now been generalized to higher rank symmetric tensor fields on spaces of dimension &lt;math&gt;n\ge 2 &lt;/math&gt;

==Rank 2 tensor fields==
For a symmetric rank 2 tensor field &lt;math&gt;F&lt;/math&gt; in n-dimensional Euclidean space (&lt;math&gt;n \ge 2&lt;/math&gt;) the [[integrability condition]] takes the form of the vanishing of the Saint-Venant's tensor &lt;math&gt;W(F)&lt;/math&gt; &lt;ref&gt;N.I. Muskhelishvili,   Some Basic Problems of the Mathematical Theory of Elasticity. Leyden: Noordhoff Intern. Publ., 1975.&lt;/ref&gt; defined by 
:&lt;math&gt;W_{ijkl} = \frac{\partial^2 F_{ij}}{\partial x_k \partial x_l} + 
\frac{\partial^2 F_{kl}}{\partial x_i \partial x_j} - \frac{\partial^2 F_{il}}{\partial x_j \partial x_k} -\frac{\partial^2 F_{jk}}{\partial x_i \partial x_l}
&lt;/math&gt;

The result that, on a [[simply connected]] domain W=0 implies that strain is the symmetric derivative of some vector field, was first described by Barré de Saint-Venant in 1864 and proved rigorously by [[Eugenio Beltrami|Beltrami]] in 1886.&lt;ref name="Amrouche"/&gt; For non-simply connected domains there are finite dimensional spaces of symmetric tensors with vanishing Saint-Venant's tensor that are not the symmetric derivative of a vector field. The situation is analogous to [[de Rham cohomology]]&lt;ref&gt;Giuseppe Geymonat, Francoise Krasucki, Hodge decomposition for symmetric matrix fields and the elasticity complex in Lipschitz domains,COMMUNICATIONS ON PURE AND APPLIED ANALYSIS, Volume 8, Number 1, January 2009, pp. 295–309 {{DOI|10.3934/cpaa.2009.8.295}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

The Saint-Venant tensor &lt;math&gt;W&lt;/math&gt; is closely related to the [[Riemann curvature tensor]] &lt;math&gt;R_{ijkl}&lt;/math&gt;. Indeed the first variation &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt; about the Euclidean metric with a perturbation in the metric &lt;math&gt;F&lt;/math&gt; is precisely &lt;math&gt;W&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;Philippe G. Ciarlet , Cristinel Mardare , Ming Shen, Recovery of a displacement field from its linearized strain tensor field in curvilinear coordinates, C. R. Acad. Sci. Paris, Ser. I 344 (2007) 535–540&lt;/ref&gt; Consequently the number of independent components of &lt;math&gt;W&lt;/math&gt; is the same as &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt;&lt;ref name=Georgiyecskii&gt;
D. V. Georgiyecskii and  B. Ye. Pobedrya,The number of independent compatibility equations in the mechanics of deformable solids, Journal of Applied Mathematicsand Mechanics,68 (2004)941-946&lt;/ref&gt; specifically &lt;math&gt;\frac{n^2 (n^2-1)}{12}&lt;/math&gt; for dimension n.&lt;ref&gt;Weisstein, Eric W. Riemann Tensor. From MathWorld--A Wolfram Web Resource. http://mathworld.wolfram.com/RiemannTensor.html&lt;/ref&gt; Specifically for &lt;math&gt;n=2&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;W&lt;/math&gt; has only one independent component where as for &lt;math&gt;n=3&lt;/math&gt; there are six.

In its simplest form of course the components of &lt;math&gt;F&lt;/math&gt; must be assumed twice continuously differentiable, but more recent work&lt;ref name="Amrouche"&gt;C Amrouche, [[Philippe G. Ciarlet|PG Ciarlet]], L Gratie, S Kesavan,  On Saint Venant's compatibility conditions and Poincaré's lemma, C. R. Acad. Sci. Paris, Ser. I, 342 (2006), 887-891.  {{doi|10.1016/j.crma.2006.03.026}}&lt;/ref&gt; proves the result in a much more general case.

The relation between Saint-Venant's compatibility condition and [[Poincaré's lemma]] can be understood more clearly using a reduced form of &lt;math&gt;W&lt;/math&gt; the Kröner tensor &lt;ref name=Georgiyecskii/&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;
K_{i_1...i_{n-2}j_1...j_{n-2}} = \epsilon_{i_1...i_{n-2}kl}\epsilon_{j_1...j_{n-2}mp}F_{lm,kp}
&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt; \epsilon&lt;/math&gt; is the [[permutation symbol]]. For &lt;math&gt;n=3&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;K&lt;/math&gt;is a symmetric rank 2 tensor field. The vanishing of &lt;math&gt;K&lt;/math&gt; is equivalent to the vanishing of &lt;math&gt;W&lt;/math&gt; and this also shows that there are six independent components for the important case of three dimensions. While this still involves two derivatives rather than the one in the Poincaré lemma, it is possible to reduce to a problem involving first derivatives by introducing more variables and it has been shown that the resulting 'elasticity complex' is equivalent to the [[de Rham complex]].&lt;ref&gt;M Eastwood, A complex from linear elasticity, Rendiconti del circolo mathematico di Palermo, Ser II Suppl 63 (2000), pp23-29&lt;/ref&gt;

In differential geometry the symmetrized derivative of a vector field appears also as the [[Lie derivative#Lie derivative of tensor fields|Lie derivative]] of the metric tensor ''g'' with respect to the vector field.
:&lt;math&gt; T_{ij}=(\mathcal L_U g)_{ij} = U_{i;j}+U_{j;i}
&lt;/math&gt;
where indices following a semicolon indicate covariant differentiation. The vanishing of &lt;math&gt;W(T)&lt;/math&gt; is thus the integrability condition for local existence of &lt;math&gt;U&lt;/math&gt; in the Euclidean case. As noted above this coincides with the vanishing of the linearization of the Riemann curvature tensor about the Euclidean metric.

==Generalization to higher rank tensors==

Saint-Venant's compatibility condition can be thought of as an analogue, for symmetric tensor fields, of [[Poincaré's lemma]] for skew-symmetric tensor fields ([[differential form]]s). The result can be generalized to higher rank [[symmetric tensor]] fields.&lt;ref&gt;
V.A. Sharafutdinov, Integral Geometry of Tensor Fields, VSP 1994,{{isbn|90-6764-165-0}}. Chapter 2.[http://www.math.nsc.ru/~sharafutdinov/files/book.pdf on-line version]&lt;/ref&gt; Let F be a symmetric rank-k tensor field on an open set in n-dimensional [[Euclidean space]], then the symmetric derivative is the rank k+1 tensor field defined by
:&lt;math&gt; (dF)_{i_1... i_k i_{k+1}} = F_{(i_1... i_k,i_{k+1})}&lt;/math&gt;
where we use the classical notation that indices following a comma indicate differentiation and groups of indices enclosed in brackets indicate symmetrization over those indices. The Saint-Venant tensor &lt;math&gt;W&lt;/math&gt; of a  symmetric rank-k tensor field &lt;math&gt;T&lt;/math&gt; is defined by
:&lt;math&gt; W_{i_1..i_k j_1...j_k}=V_{(i_1..i_k)(j_1...j_k)}&lt;/math&gt;
with
:&lt;math&gt; V_{i_1..i_k j_1...j_k} = \sum\limits_{p=0}^{k} (-1)^p {k \choose p}  T_{i_1..i_{k-p}j_1...j_p,j_{p+1}...j_k i_{k-p+1}...i_k } &lt;/math&gt;
On a [[simply connected]] domain in Euclidean space &lt;math&gt;W=0&lt;/math&gt; implies that &lt;math&gt; T = dF&lt;/math&gt; for some rank k-1 symmetric tensor field &lt;math&gt;F&lt;/math&gt;.

'''Scalping''' is the act of cutting or tearing a part of the human [[scalp]], with hair attached, from the head.

This can either occur as part of war with the scalp being a [[Human trophy collecting|trophy]],&lt;ref&gt;Griffin, Anastasia M. (2008). [[Georg Friederici]]'s (1906) "Scalping and Similar Warfare Customs in America" with a Critical Introduction. ProQuest. {{ISBN|9780549562092}} p.18.&lt;/ref&gt; or as an accident. Scalp-taking is considered part of the broader cultural practice of the taking and display of human body parts as trophies, and may have developed as an alternative to the taking of human heads, for scalps were easier to take, transport, and preserve for subsequent display. Scalping independently developed in various cultures in both the [[Old World|Old]] and [[New World]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Human Trophy Taking in Eastern North America During the Archaic Period: The Relationship to Warfare and Social Complexity|author1=Mensforth, Robert P. |work=The Taking and Displaying of Human Body Parts as Trophies by Amerindians|author2=Chacon, Richard J.

In England in 1036,  [[Godwin, Earl of Wessex|Earl Godwin]], father of [[Harold Godwinson]], was reportedly responsible for scalping his enemies. According to the ancient [[Anglo-Saxon Chronicle|Abingdon manuscript]], 'some of them were blinded, some maimed, some scalped. No more horrible deed was done in this country since the [[Danes (Germanic tribe)|Danes]] came and made peace here'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://classesv2.yale.edu/access/content/user/haw6/Vikings/AS%20Chronicle%20Abingdon%20MS.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2017-08-18 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170820140611/https://classesv2.yale.edu/access/content/user/haw6/Vikings/AS%20Chronicle%20Abingdon%20MS.html |archivedate=2017-08-20 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Georg Frederici noted that “[[Herodotus]] provided the only clear and satisfactory portrayal of a scalping people in the old world” in his description of the [[Scythians]], a nomadic people then located to the north and west of the Black Sea.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author1=Griffin, Anastasia M. (editor) |title=Critical Introduction|date=2008| author2=Frederici, Georg |work=Scalping and Similar Warfare Customs in America |publisher= ProQuest|isbn=9780549562092|page=180}}&lt;/ref&gt; Herodotus related that Scythian warriors would behead the enemies they defeated in battle and present the heads to their king to claim their share of the plunder. Then, the warrior would skin the head “by making a circular cut round the ears and shaking out the skull; he then scrapes the flesh off the skin with the rib of an ox, and when it is clean works it with his fingers until it is supple, and fit to be used as a sort of handkerchief. He hangs these handkerchiefs on the bridle of his horse, and is very proud of them. The best man is the man who has the greatest number.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Herodotus|title= The Histories|author2= De Selincourt, Aubrey (translator)|publisher= Penguin Books|location= London|date= 2003|pages= 260–261}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Ammianus Marcellinus]] noted the taking of scalps by the [[Alani]], a people of Asiatic [[Scythia]], in terms quite similar to those used by Herodotus.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Marcellinus, Ammianus |title= Roman History, Book XXXI, II|location= London|publisher= Bohn|date= 1862|page= 22|author2=Yonge, C.D. }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Abbé [[Emmanuel H. D. Domenech]] referenced the ''decalvare'' of the ancient [[Germanic peoples|Germans]] and the ''capillos et cutem detrahere'' of the code of the [[Visigoths]] as examples of scalping in early [[Middle Ages|medieval Europe]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Domenech, Abbe Emmanuel |title= Seven Years’ Residence in the Great Deserts of North America, Vol. 2|location= London|publisher= Longman Green|date= 1860|page= 358}}&lt;/ref&gt; though some more recent interpretations of these terms relate them to shaving off the hair of the head as a legal punishment rather than scalping.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Crouch, Jace |title=The Judicial Punishment of Delcavatio in Visigothic Spain: A Proposed Solution based on Isidore of Seville and the Lex Visigothorum|pages=  1–5}} and Abstract.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1845, mercenary John Duncan observed what he estimated to be 700 scalps taken in warfare and displayed as trophies by a contingent of female soldiers  — [[Dahomey Amazons]] — employed by the King of Dahomey (present-day [[Republic of Benin]]). Duncan noted that these would have been taken and kept over a long period of time and would not have come from a single battle. Although Duncan travelled widely in Dahomey, and described customs such as the taking of heads and the retention of skulls as trophies, nowhere else does he mention scalping.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Travels in Western Africa in 1845 &amp; 1846, Comprising a Journey from Whydah, through the Kingdom of Dahomey, to Adofoodia, in the Interior, Vol. I|author=Duncan, John |location= London|publisher= Richard Bentley|date= 1847|pages= 233–234}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Travels in Western Africa in 1845 &amp; 1846, Comprising a Journey from Whydah, through the Kingdom of Dahomey, to Adofoodia, in the Interior, Vol. II|author=Duncan, John |location= London|publisher= Richard Bentley|date= 1847|pages= 274–275}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Techniques===
Specific scalping techniques varied somewhat from place to place, depending on the cultural patterns of the scalper regarding the desired shape, size, and intended use of the severed scalp, and on how the victims wore their hair, but the general process of scalping was quite uniform.  The scalper firmly grasped the hair of a subdued adversary, made several quick semicircular cuts with a sharp instrument on either side of the area to be taken, and then vigorously yanked at the nearly-severed scalp. The scalp separated from the skull along the plane of the [[Loose_connective_tissue#Areolar_tissue|areolar connective tissue]], the fourth (and least substantial) of the five layers of the human scalp. Scalping was not in itself fatal, though it was most commonly inflicted on the gravely wounded or the dead. The earliest instruments used in scalping were stone knives crafted of [[flint]], [[chert]], or [[obsidian]], or other materials like [[Reed (plant)|reeds]] or [[oyster]] shells that could be worked to carry an edge equal to the task. Collectively, such tools were also used for a variety of everyday tasks like skinning and processing game, but were replaced by metal knives acquired in trade through European contact. The implement, often referred to as a “scalping knife” in popular [[American literature|American]] and European literature, was not known as such by [[Native Americans in the United States|Native Americans]], a knife being for them just a simple and effective multi-purpose utility tool for which scalping was but one of many uses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Burton, Richard F. |title=Anthropological Review, Vol. 2, No. 4 |date=February 1864|pages= 50–51}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author1=Griffin, Anastasia M.

Author and historian Mark van de Logt wrote, "Although military historians tend to reserve the concept of 'total war{{'"}}, in which civilians are targeted, "for conflicts between modern industrial nations," the term "closely approaches the state of affairs between the [[Pawnee people|Pawnees]], the [[Great Sioux Nation|Sioux]], and the [[Cheyennes]]. Noncombatants were legitimate targets. Indeed, the taking of a scalp of a woman or child was considered honorable because it signified that the scalp taker had dared to enter the very heart of the enemy's territory."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Mark |last=van de Logt |year=2012 |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=Bbgh_hA4ib4C&amp;pg=&amp;dq&amp;hl=en#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false |title=War Party in Blue: Pawnee Scouts in the U.S. Army |publisher= [[University of Oklahoma Press]] | page=35 |isbn=0806184396}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many tribes of Native Americans practiced scalping, in some instances up until the end of the 19th century. Of the approximately 500 bodies at the [[Crow Creek massacre]] site, 90 percent of the skulls show evidence of scalping. The event took place ''circa'' 1325 AD.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book

During the [[French and Indian War]], as of June 12, 1755, Massachusetts governor William Shirley was offering a bounty of £40 for a male Indian scalp, and £20 for scalps of females or of children under 12 years old.&lt;ref name=comics/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=OKfBId96DTIC&amp;pg=PA88 |title=Chronology of American Indian History |author=Liz Sonneborn |page=88 |website=Books.google.ca |date=2014-05-14 |accessdate=2016-07-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1756, Pennsylvania Lieutenant Governor Robert Morris, in his Declaration of War against the Lenni Lenape (Delaware) people, offered "130 [[Spanish dollar|Pieces of Eight]], for the Scalp of Every Male Indian Enemy, above the Age of Twelve Years," and "50 Pieces of Eight for the Scalp of Every Indian Woman, produced as evidence of their being killed."&lt;ref name=comics&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bluecorncomics.com/scalping.htm |title=Scalping, Torture, and Mutilation by Indians |publisher=Blue Corn Comics |date= |accessdate=2016-07-28 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160831170415/http://www.bluecorncomics.com/scalping.htm |archivedate=2016-08-31 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://faculty.simpson.edu/nick.proctor/www/1756/war.htm|archiveurl=https://archive.today/20140207020013/http://faculty.simpson.edu/nick.proctor/www/1756/war.htm|deadurl=yes|title=Declaration of War|author=|date=7 February 2014|archivedate=7 February 2014|website=simpson.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== American Revolution ===
In the [[American Revolutionary War]], [[Henry Hamilton (governor)|Henry Hamilton]], the Lieutenant Governor and Superintendent of Indian Affairs at [[Fort Detroit]], was known by [[Patriot (American Revolution)|American Patriots]] as the "hair-buyer general" because they believed he encouraged and paid his Native American allies to scalp American settlers. When Hamilton was captured in the war by the colonists, he was treated as a [[war criminal]] instead of a [[prisoner of war]] because of this. However, American historians have conceded that there was no positive proof that he had ever offered rewards for scalps.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite DCB |last=Arthur |first=Elizabeth |url=http://www.biographi.ca/en/bio/hamilton_henry_4E.html |title=Hamilton, Henry |volume=4}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is now assumed that during the American Revolution, no British officer paid for scalps.&lt;ref&gt;Kelsey pg. 303&lt;/ref&gt; During the [[Sullivan Expedition]], the September 13, 1779 journal entry of Lieutenant William Barton tells of patriots participating in scalping.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://archive.org/stream/cu31924095654384#page/n38/mode/1up/ |title=Journals of the military expedition of Major General John Sullivan against the Six nations of Indians in 1779; with records of centennial celebrations; prepared pursuant to chapter 361, laws of the state of New York, of 1885 |website=Archive.org |date= |accessdate=2016-07-28 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160322181618/http://archive.org/stream/cu31924095654384#page/n38/mode/1up/ |archivedate=2016-03-22 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Mexico ===
In 1835, the government of the Mexican state of [[Sonora]] put a bounty on the [[Apache]] which,&lt;ref name="haley"/&gt; over time, evolved into a payment by the government of 100 pesos for each scalp of a male 14 or more years old {{citation needed|date=March 2015}}. In 1837, the Mexican state of [[Chihuahua (state)|Chihuahua]] also offered a bounty on Apache scalps, 100 pesos per warrior, 50 pesos per woman, and 25 pesos per child.&lt;ref name="haley"&gt;{{cite book |first=James L. |last=Haley |authorlink=James L.

===Civil War===
Some scalping incidents even occurred during the [[American Civil War]].  For example, [[Confederate States of America|Confederate]] [[Guerrilla warfare in the American Civil War|guerrillas]] led by [[William T. Anderson|"Bloody Bill" Anderson]] were well known for decorating their saddles with the scalps of [[Union (American Civil War)|Union soldiers]] they had killed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/amex/james/peopleevents/p_anderson.html |title=William "Bloody Bill" Anderson .

===Continued Indian Wars===

In 1851, the [[United States Army|U.S. Army]] displayed Indian scalps in [[Stanislaus County, California]]. In [[Tehama County, California]], U.S. military and local volunteers razed villages and scalped hundreds of men, women, and children.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Pfaelzer|first1=Jean|title=Driven Out: The Forgotten War against Chinese Americans|date=2007|publisher=Random House|location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{When|date=July 2018}}

Scalping also occurred during the [[Sand Creek Massacre]] on November 29, 1864, during the [[American Indian Wars]], when a 700-man force of U.S. Army volunteers destroyed the village of [[Cheyenne]] and [[Arapaho]] in southeastern [[Colorado Territory]], killing and mutilating&lt;ref name="A Century of Dishonor"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Jackson|first1=Helen|title=A Century of Dishonor|date=1994|publisher=Indian Head Books|location=United States|isbn=1-56619-167-X|page=344}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=hoig_book&gt;{{cite book|last=Hoig|first=Stan|title=The Sand Creek Massacre|year=2005|publisher=University of Oklahoma Press|location=Norman|page=153|isbn=978-0-8061-1147-6|origyear=1974}}&lt;/ref&gt; an estimated 70–163 Native Americans.&lt;ref name=Dee_book&gt;{{cite book| last = Brown| first = Dee| title = Bury my heart at Wounded Knee| origyear  = 1970| publisher = Macmillan| chapter = War Comes to the Cheyenne| pages = 86–87| isbn = 978-0-8050-6634-0| year = 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.pbs.org/weta/thewest/program/episodes/four/whois.htm |title=THE WEST - Who is the Savage? |website=Pbs.org |date= |accessdate=2016-07-28 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160726000602/http://www.pbs.org/weta/thewest/program/episodes/four/whois.htm |archivedate=2016-07-26 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=John Evans Study Report|url=https://portfolio.du.edu/downloadItem/286858|publisher=University of Denver|accessdate=6 January 2016|date=November 2014|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141207203926/https://portfolio.du.edu/downloadItem/286858|archivedate=7 December 2014|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; An 1867 ''[[The New York Times|New York Times]]'' article reported that "settlers in a small town in Colorado Territory had recently subscribed $5,000 to a fund ‘for the purpose of buying Indian scalps (with $25 each to be paid for scalps with the ears on)’ and that the market for Indian scalps ‘is not affected by age or sex’." The article noted this behavior was "sanctioned" by the [[Federal government of the United States|U.S. federal government]], and was modeled on patterns the U.S. had begun a century earlier in the "American East".&lt;ref name="Kakel"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Kakel|first1=Carroll P.|title=The American West and the Nazi East, A Comparative and Interpretive Perspective|date=2011|publisher=Palgrave Macmillan|page=}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|206}}

From one writer's point of view, it was a "uniquely American" innovation that the use of scalp bounties in the wars against indigenous societies "became an indiscriminate killing process that deliberately targeted Indian non-combatants (including women, children, and infants), as well as warriors."&lt;ref name="Kakel"/&gt;{{rp|204}}

[[File:Moll - Map of South America - Detail Potosi.png|thumb|alt=Inset view of Potosí by Bernard Lens from Herman Moll. ''Map of South America''. London: c. 1715.|[[Cerro Rico|Cerro Rico de Potosí]] as depicted in 1715, a possible origin of the Sierra de la Plata myth.]]

The '''Sierra de la Plata''' ("Silver Mountains") was a mythical source of [[silver]] in the interior of [[South America]]. The legend began in the early 16th century when [[castaway]]s from the [[Juan Díaz de Solís]] expedition heard indigenous stories of a mountain of silver in an inland region ruled by the so-called White King. The first European to lead an expedition in search of it was the castaway [[Aleixo Garcia]], who crossed nearly the entire continent to reach the Andean [[altiplano]]. On his way back to the coast, Garcia died in an ambush by indigenous tribespeople in [[Paraguay]], but survivors brought [[precious metal]]s back to corroborate their story. The legend inspired other expeditions, all of which ended in failure.

The [[Río de la Plata]] (literally "Silver River") and the modern country of [[Argentina]] (from the [[Latin language|Latin]] ''argentum'', "silver") both take their names from the myth. The legend of the Sierra de la Plata may have been based on the [[Cerro Rico|Cerro Rico de Potosí]] in [[Bolivia]], which was discovered by a Spanish expedition traveling from [[Peru]] in 1545.

== Origins of the Legend ==

=== Juan Díaz de Solís ===

[[File:Brazil 16thc map.jpg|thumb|Map from the [[Miller Atlas]] (1519) showing the coast of Brazil and the mouths of the [[Amazon River]] and the [[Río de la Plata]].]]

The legend of the White King and the Sierra de la Plata began with the expeditions of [[Juan Díaz de Solís]] along the coast of South America. On his first voyage in 1512,&lt;ref name="Gómara"&gt;López de Gómara, Francisco. ''Historia General de las Indias''. Medina del Campo: 1553; Zaragoza: 1555. [http://www.cervantesvirtual.com/servlet/SirveObras/02588400888014428632268/index.htm]&lt;/ref&gt; Solís followed the coast of [[Brazil]] until he came across an enormous estuary, the Río de la Plata, which [[Amerigo Vespucci]] had named the River Jordan&lt;ref&gt;García Mata, Rafael. "Había un Río Jordan al sur del Nuevo Mundo... y era el Río de la Plata". ''La Nación'' [Buenos Aires, Argentina] 6 May 2001. [http://www.lanacion.com.ar/210790-habia-un-rio-jordan-al-sur-del-nuevo-mundo-y-era-el-rio-de-la-plata]&lt;/ref&gt; on his [[Amerigo Vespucci#First voyage|1501-02 expedition]] and the local inhabitants called Paranaguazu ("river like the sea" or "great water").&lt;ref name="Gómara" /&gt; Solís decided to call it the Mar Dulce ("Freshwater Sea") due to its great size. After exploring the area and guessing it could be a strait connecting the [[Atlantic Ocean|Atlantic]] to the [[Pacific Ocean|Pacific]], Solís returned to [[Spain]] to stake his claim as conqueror and governor of the region.&lt;ref name="Gómara" /&gt; In 1516, he returned with the title of Captain General, but when Solís and his party landed on the eastern bank of the Río de la Plata, they were attacked and killed by [[Guaraní people|Guaranís]]. Seeing this, the crew remaining on the ships decided to weigh anchor and return to Spain.&lt;ref name="Gómara" /&gt;

=== Aleixo Garcia ===

On their way back to Europe, one of the Solís expedition's vessels shipwrecked off the coast of [[Santa Catarina Island]] in what is now Brazil, leaving eighteen men stranded. One of them, the [[Portugal|Portuguese]] explorer [[Aleixo Garcia]], became friendly with the local Tupí-Guaranís, and through them learned of a great mountain of shining metals far into the mainland.

Garcia left Santa Catarina along with other castaways and a large indigenous party to search for the Sierra de la Plata, crossing most of South America before reaching the Andean altiplano. This was supposedly the home of the White King, whose throne was entirely decorated with silver. After taking a few valuable pieces, the explorers headed back to the Brazilian coast, but along the way, Aleixo Garcia and the other Europeans were killed in a [[Payaguá people|Payaguá]] ambush. The few Tupí-Guaranís who managed to escape told their story, showing off the silver pieces they had gotten from the realms of the White King.

== Search for Sierra de la Plata ==

=== Sebastian Cabot ===

[[File:Riodelaplatabasinmap.png|thumb|300px|[[Río de la Plata Basin]]]]

In 1526, the [[Venice|Venetian]] explorer [[Sebastian Cabot (explorer)|Sebastian Cabot]] left Spain with the goal of reaching the [[Maluku Islands|Molucca Islands]] in [[Indonesia]] by way of the [[Straits of Magellan]]. During a stopover in [[Pernambuco]] in northern Brazil, he first heard the story about a land rich in precious metals far inland, which could be reached via an enormous estuary further south. The estuary ended up being called the Río de la Plata for its role as the supposed natural gateway to the treasure. The legend captivated Cabot, so he abandoned his mission and decided to find the Sierra de la Plata, assuming that the royal authorities would be indulgent if he found enough silver.

On Santa Catarina, the castaways Melchor Rodríguez and Enrique Morales confirmed the stories, telling Cabot about Aleixo Garcia's expedition and showing him the metals that had been brought back. Cabot headed toward Río de la Plata, where he disembarked to repair two ships that had been damaged in a storm. There, the expedition met former cabin boy [[Francisco del Puerto]], the sole survivor of Solís's landing party. Del Puerto, who was living with the Guaranís, also verified the legend and offered his services as guide and interpreter.

After entering the Río de la Plata, the expedition divided in two: Cabot would continue up the [[Paraná River]] and [[Antón de Grajeda]] would travel up the [[Uruguay River]]. In 1527, at the confluence of the Paraná and [[Carcarañá River|Carcarañá]] Rivers, Cabot established the fort of [[Sancti Spiritu (Argentina)|Sancti Spiritu]], the first European settlement in the [[Río de la Plata basin]], and a future base for expeditions to the land of the White King. The party was suffering from hunger and sickness, and since they could not travel by land, they continued north upriver until they landed at an island they named Año Nuevo ("New Year"). There, they traded colored glass with the [[Timbú people|Timbús]] for food, but Cabot, thinking he had been shortchanged, ordered his men to kill them, burn their homes, and take their food.

In February 1529, they reached an indigenous town they called Santa Ana, where they were treated hospitably, fed well, and told rumors of other "white men" who were coming up the river behind them. Cabot, however, stuck to his plan and continued up the [[Paraguay River]] until strong currents prevented him from going further. There, he had a [[brigantine]] sent ahead under the command of [[Miguel de Rifos]]. Near the confluence of the [[Pilcomayo River]], Rifos decided to disembark with a few men after being welcomed by some indigenous people on the shore. The Europeans headed through the forest to the village, where they were unexpectedly ambushed. Supposedly, it was a trap arranged by the local chief and Del Puerto, who wanted a larger share of the plunder.

Those who had stayed in the brigantine managed to escape, and when they returned to Cabot, he decided to head back to Sancti Spiritu. On the way, he came across [[Diego García de Moguer|Diego García]], the "other white man" he had been told about. García, like Cabot, had been commissioned to travel to the Moluccas, but had deserted when he heard the tales of the White King. After a brief dispute, the two captains decided to join forces to find the Sierra de la Plata, with Cabot in charge of the unified fleet.

At Sancti Spiritu, Captain [[Francisco César]] was chosen to explore the local region together with another fifteen soldiers. Three months later César returned with half of his men and a rumor that nearby was a great city full of riches that from then on would be known as the [[City of the Caesars|Ciudad de los Césares]] ("City of the Caesars").

The Sebastian Cabot expedition ended in failure when Cabot and Diego García made their next attempt to find the Sierra de la Plata. The local indigenous people took advantage of their absence to attack and destroy Fort Sancti Spiritu, killing many of his men. Low on morale, food, and supplies, Cabot and his crew were finally forced to give up their goal and return to Europe.

=== Pedro de Mendoza ===

[[File:Buenos Aires shortly after its foundation 1536.png|thumb|300px|Santa María de los Buenos Ayres, shortly after its foundation in 1536.]]

In 1534, King [[Charles I of Spain|Charles I]] authorized [[Pedro de Mendoza]] to "conquer and populate the lands and provinces around the Solís River, which some call the Plate". With fourteen ships and some 1,200 men, it was at the time the largest and most important expedition that had left Europe for America.&lt;ref name="fundaciones"&gt;Pigna, Felipe. "Fundaciones de Ciudades". ''El Historiador'' [http://www.elhistoriador.com.ar/articulos/conquista_y_colonia/fundaciones_de_ciudades.php]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1536 Pedro de Mendoza founded the port of [[Buenos Aires|Santa María de los Buenos Ayres]], which was probably located in what is now the [[Lezama Park|Parque Lezama]] in Buenos Aires.&lt;ref name="fundaciones" /&gt; Resources were in short supply to support such a population, and after the Spaniards mistreated the local [[Querandí]]s, they stopped supplying food to the settlement. Mendoza decided to send out two fleets in search of food: the first, led by his nephew [[Gonzalo de Mendoza]], headed toward Brazil, and the second, led by [[Juan de Ayolas]], went up the River Paraná with three ships and 270 men. Meanwhile, Mendoza ordered his brother [[Diego de Mendoza (conquistador)|Diego]] to take 300 soldiers and 30 cavalrymen to fight the Querandís. The battle was a failure. Diego de Mendoza was killed, and the Querandís began a long-lasting siege of Buenos Aires. Cut off from supplies, the settlers began to eat their horses and their dead. Finally, the Querandís withdrew, and in a few days, the Juan de Ayolas expedition returned with the news that they had managed to build a fort called Corpus Christi upriver near the modern-day town of [[Gaboto]] and had encountered some indigenous people who talked about the Sierra de la Plata. Pedro de Mendoza decided to travel to the fort with Ayolas and some 400 men.

During the voyage, some 200 men died of sickness and hunger, and once they reached Corpus Christi, Mendoza consulted Cabot's map to find that they were still far from their destination. These major setbacks, along with the [[syphilis]] he had contracted, convinced Mendoza to return to Europe after a short stop in Buenos Aires.

Pedro de Mendoza died on the open sea on June 23, 1537.&lt;ref name="fundaciones" /&gt; Juan de Ayolas, who had left Corpus Christi on October 14, 1536 with a fleet of three brigantines and 170 soldiers, inherited his title of ''[[adelantado]]''. Meanwhile, Buenos Aires had overcome its famine thanks to provisions Gonzalo de Mendoza brought from Brazil, and was left under the provisional command of Captain [[Francisco Ruiz Galán]], who ordered the first planting of corn with the goal of making the fort self-sustainable.

=== Juan de Ayolas ===

[[File:Pilcomayo rio.jpg|thumb|300px|The Pilcomayo river at [[Tarija]], [[Bolivia]].]]

Before Pedro de Mendoza left Buenos Aires, having no news of the Ayolas expedition, he sent [[Juan de Salazar Espinosa]] upriver in search of him. On August 15, 1537, Espinosa established the fort of [[Asunción|Nuestra Señora de la Asunción]] (today Asunción, Paraguay) at the junction of the rivers Paraguay and Pilcomayo.

Meanwhile, Juan de Ayolas was further up the river Paraguay in Payagua territory, where he met one of Aleixo Garcia's former companions, who told him how difficult the journey had been, due to all the gold and silver that weighed them down. Hearing this story, Ayolas decided to found the port of Candelaria on the spot (close to present-day [[Corumbá]]) and commissioned [[Domingo Martínez de Irala]] as provisional Lieutenant Governor until he returned from an overland expedition with 130 soldiers. After a short time, with no news of Ayola, Irala decided to abandon his post and return downriver to the fort of Asunción.

However, the Juan de Ayolas expedition had successfully reached a mountainous area where precious metals were mined. On his return trip, his party suffered losses from skirmishes with indigenous people, and before he reached the Paraguay River, he ordered his men to bury most of the treasure they carried. When he returned, he was disappointed to find the port of Candelaria abandoned, so he accepted the invitation of the Payaguas to rest in their village. On his way there, a fight broke out between the Spaniards and the local people, and almost the entire expedition was killed, including Juan de Ayolas.

After this, Domingo Martínez de Irala became the expedition's new leader, and he took up the goal of conquering the Sierra de la Plata and the lands of the White King. Irala decided to convert Asunción into the headquarters of the conquest, and ordered the colonists at Buenos Aires to tear down their buildings and move to Asunción. However, their newly planted corn was yielding a good crop, and they refused to move. Six months later, Irala disembarked at Buenos Aires to carry out the order. The first settlement at Buenos Aires was finally destroyed and abandoned in 1541.

=== Álvar Núñez Cabeza de Vaca ===

[[File:Iguassu falls rainbow.jpg|thumb|300px|[[Iguazú Falls]] on the border of Argentina and Brazil.]]

While Irala was preparing his expedition to the Sierra de la Plata, Spain had chosen [[Álvar Núñez Cabeza de Vaca]] as the official successor to Pedro de Mendoza's title of ''adelantado''. Known for his long residence among the Indians of modern-day [[Texas]] and northern [[Mexico]], Cabeza de Vaca decided to cross Paraguay on foot rather than travel by boat up the Río de la Plata. In October 1541, his expedition left Santa Catalina, crossing jungles, mountains, and rivers to reach Asunción. In January 1542, they passed [[Iguazú Falls]] and on March 11, 1542, they reached Asunción, where they met Domingo Martínez de Irala.

Cabeza de Vaca clashed with the colonists at Asunción, calling the village a "Moorish paradise," as each colonist had taken multiple indigenous women as wives.

Soon, Cabeza de Vaca began to prepare an expedition to the lands of the White King. First, he sent Irala up the Paraguay River to see if it led to the Sierra de la Plata. He reached [[La Gaiba Lake]] in the [[Pantanal]] region, where he founded the [[Puerto de los Reyes]]. In September 1543, Cabeza de Vaca led his own expedition through the forest, but sickness and clashes with his officers, mostly Irala's men, convinced him to abandon his search and return to Asunción.

With his authority undermined and disliked by the colonists, the Captain General was soon overthrown. On April 25, 1544, Irala's men entered Cabeza de Vaca's house and took him prisoner. Eleven months later, he was sent to Spain on a ship under the command of Gonzalo de Mendoza. During the voyage, a violent storm broke out, which the superstitious sailors interpreted as divine punishment, so they decided to free all of their prisoners. In Spain, Cabeza de Vaca denounced the colonists' actions to the court, but the case was never resolved, and he never returned to the Americas.

=== Domingo Martínez de Irala ===

[[File:El palacio.jpg|thumb|300px|View of modern-day Asunción, Paraguay.]]

With his authority confirmed, [[Domingo Martínez de Irala]] organized an expedition of 300 Spanish men and 3,000 indigenous men in search of the Sierra de la Plata. After a few battles with indigenous peoples, Irala's men reached a tribe of [[Macasí]]s, who immediately began speaking to them in Spanish. They told them their lord was Pedro Anzures, and therefore they were out of their jurisdiction. Irala sent a party to speak with the governor of Peru, [[Pedro de la Gasca]], who only ordered the expedition to go no further under pain of death, so they had no choice but to return to Asunción.

Irala organized several other expeditions to legendary locations like the "Land of Riches", the "Lake of [[El Dorado]]", and "[[Paititi]]". All of these expeditions ended in failure, with great cost in human lives and materials. Meanwhile, the king named [[Juan de Sanabria]] as the new ''adelantado'' in the region, but he died during preparations and was replaced by his son [[Diego de Sanabria|Diego]], who ended up staying in Europe even though several of his ships had already sailed. Finally, the crown decided to formalize Irala's de facto power, so as Irala was preparing his next expedition, a royal emissary arrived in Asunción, informing Irala that he had been named governor of the [[Governorate of New Andalusia]] (also known as the Governorate of the Río de la Plata and Paraguay) with express orders not to lead any more expeditions. With Buenos Aires destroyed and the Sierra de la Plata under another jurisdiction, Paraguay experienced a long period of isolation under Irala, who finally died in October 1556 at the age of 70.

== Cerro Rico de Potosí ==

The Sierra de la Plata legend likely corresponds to the [[Cerro Rico|Cerro Rico de Potosí]] in Bolivia, and the White King to the [[Inca]] [[Huayna Cápac]]. When Aleixo Garcia explored the region and discovered precious metals in the early 16th century, Spain had barely begun colonizing the coasts of Panama and Colombia, and Portugal had barely begun colonizing the coast of Brazil. Neither of the two crowns knew about the existence of the [[Inca Empire]] until [[Francisco Pizarro]] encountered it in 1528, traveling from the Pacific coast. King Charles I tried to solve conflicts between conquistadors by dividing South America into several governorates: [[Governorate of New Castile|New Castile]], under Francisco Pizarro, which reached from the [[Santiago River (Ecuador)|Santiago River]], [[Ecuador]] to [[Pisco]], Peru; [[Governorate of New Toledo|New Toledo]], under [[Diego de Almagro]], from Pisco to [[Taltal]], [[Chile]]; and [[Governorate of New Andalusia|New Andalusia]], under Pedro de Mendoza, two hundred leagues south. Of these three, it was Almagro's men who first found the Cerro Rico de Potosí, leaving New Andalusia without any claim to the Sierra de la Plata.

'''Social distance''' describes the [[distance#Theoretical distances|distance]] between different [[Social group|group]]s in [[society]] and is opposed to [[distance#Physical distances|''locational distance'']]&lt;ref&gt;Simandan, D. 2016. Proximity, subjectivity, and space: Rethinking distance in human geography. Geoforum, 75, pp. 249-252. https://doi.org/10.1016/j.geoforum.2016.07.018 &lt;/ref&gt;. The notion includes differences such as [[social class]], [[Race (classification of human beings)|race]]/[[ethnicity]], [[gender]] or [[human sexuality|sexuality]], but also the fact that the different groups mix less than members of the same group&lt;ref&gt;Smith, J.A., McPherson, M. and Smith-Lovin, L., 2014. Social distance in the United States: Sex, race, religion, age, and education homophily among confidants, 1985 to 2004. American Sociological Review, 79(3), pp.432-456.&lt;/ref&gt;. The term is often applied in [[city|cities]], but its use is not limited to that. 

An old concept, in 1924 [[Robert Ezra Park|Robert E. Park]] defined social distance as "an attempt to reduce to something like measurable terms the grade and degrees of understanding and intimacy which characterizes personal and social relations generally".&lt;ref&gt;Park, R. E. (1924). The concept of social distance as applied to the study of racial attitudes and racial relations. Journal of Applied Sociology, 8, 339-344.&lt;/ref&gt; It is the measure of nearness or intimacy that an individual or group feels towards another individual or group in a social network or the level of trust one group has for another and the extent of perceived likeness of beliefs..&lt;ref&gt;Boguna, Marian, Romualdo Pastor-Satorras, Albert Díaz-Guilera, and Alex Arenas (2004).

&lt;/ref&gt;

The concept of social distance as applied to the study of racial attitudes and racial relations. Journal of Applied Sociology, 8, 339-344.&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[sociology|sociological]] literature, social distance is conceptualized in several different ways.&lt;ref name="test"&gt;Karakayali, Nedim. 2009. "Social Distance and Affective Orientations." ''Sociological Forum'', vol. 23, n.3, pp. 538-562.&lt;/ref&gt;

#Affective social distance: One widespread conception of social distance focuses on [[negative affectivity|affectivity]]. According to this approach, social distance is associated with affective distance, i.e. how much sympathy the members of a group feel for another group. [[Emory Bogardus]], the creator of "Bogardus social distance scale" was typically basing his scale on this [[subjectivity|subjective-affective]] conception of social distance: "[i]n social distance studies the center of attention is on the feeling reactions of persons toward other persons and toward groups of people."&lt;ref&gt;Bogardus, E. S. 1947. ''Measurement of Personal-Group Relations,'' ''Sociometry'', 10: 4: 306–311.&lt;/ref&gt;
#Normative social distance: A second approach views social distance as a [[social norm|normative]] category. Normative social distance refers to the widely accepted and often consciously expressed norms about who should be considered as an [[ingroup|"insider"]] and who an [[Outgroup (sociology)|"outsider/foreigner".]] Such norms, in other words, specify the distinctions between "us" and "them". Therefore, normative social distance differs from affective social distance, because it conceives social distance is conceived as a [[Objectivity (science)|non-subjective]], [[social structure|structural]] aspect of social relations. Examples of this conception can be found in some of the works of sociologists such as [[Georg Simmel]], [[Emile Durkheim]] and to some extent [[Robert E. Park|Robert Park]].
#Interactive social distance: A third conceptualization of social distance focuses on the frequency and intensity of interactions between two groups, claiming that the more the members of two groups interact, the closer they are socially. This conception is similar to the approaches in [[social network|sociological network]] theory, where the frequency of interaction between two parties is used as a measure of the "strength" of the social ties between them.
#Cultural and Habitual Distance: A fourth conceptualization of social distance focuses cultural and habitual which is proposed by Bourdieu (1990). This type of distance is influenced by the "capital" people possess.  

It is possible to view these different conceptions as "dimensions" of social distance, that do not necessarily overlap. The members of two groups might interact with each other quite frequently, but this does not always mean that they will feel "close" to each other or that normatively they will consider each other as the members of the same group. In other words, interactive, normative and affective dimensions of social distance might not be linearly associated.&lt;ref name="test" /&gt;

Social distance was also used in a different meaning by [[anthropology|anthropologist]] and cross-cultural researcher, [[Edward T. Hall]], to describe the psychological distance which an animal can stand to be away from its group before beginning to feel [[anxiety|anxious]].&lt;ref&gt;Hall, E. 1982. "The Hidden Dimension" 14-15.&lt;/ref&gt; This phenomenon can be seen in human babies and toddlers who can only walk or crawl so far from their parents or guardians before becoming anxious and quickly returning to the safe space. The babies' social distance is quite small.

Hall also notes that this concept of social distance has been extended by technological advances such as the [[telephone]], [[walkie talkie]], and [[television]], among others.&lt;ref&gt;Hall, E. 1982. "The Hidden Dimension" 15.&lt;/ref&gt; Hall’s analysis of social distance came before the development of the [[internet]], which has expanded social distance exponentially. Social distance is now even expanding beyond our planet as we send people into outer space on space missions and even personal trips to space.{{Citation needed|date=March 2017}}

==Prejudice==

It is said|date=June 2016}} that every individual regards his or her own [[culture]] as being superior to all other cultures, and other cultures as being inferior due to their differences from his or her own culture.{{Citation needed|date=October 2015}} The social distance between two cultures may ultimately manifest in the form of hatred.{{Citation needed|date=October 2015}} A consequence of this distance and hatred is [[prejudice|prejudices]], that different cultural groups assume to be true for differing social groups.{{Citation needed|date=October 2015}} For example, the [[Brahmin|Brahmins]] are believed to possess the highest, and the [[Shudra|shudras]] the lowest [[Social status|status]] in [[Hindu caste system|Hindu society]]. If a Brahmin child ever touches the child of some shudra, the former is given a bath to rid him of his supposed defilement caused by his touch. As a result of this strict formulation of his activities, the Brahmin child forms a prejudice in his mind that shudras are untouchable and impure.&lt;ref name="Social Psychology"&gt;{{cite book|last=Sharma, Rajendra|first=Sharma, Rachana|title=Social Psychology|year=1972|publisher=Atlantic Publishers and distributors|location=New Delhi|pages=200–201}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ways to study social distance==
Some ways social distance can be [[measurement|measured]] include: direct observation of people interacting, questionnaires, speeded decision making tasks, route planning exercises, or other social drawing tasks (see [[sociogram]]).

In questionnaires, respondents are typically asked members of which groups they would accept in particular relationships. For example, to check whether or not they would accept a member of each group as a neighbor, as a fellow worker as a marriage partner. The social distance questionnaires may not accurately measure what people actually would do if a member of another group sought to become a friend or neighbour. The social distance scale is only an attempt to measure one's feeling of unwillingness to associate equally with a group. What a person will actually do in a situation also depends upon the circumstances of the situation.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.sociologyguide.com/basic-concepts/Social-Distance.php&lt;/ref&gt;

In speeded decision making tasks, studies have suggested a systematic relationship between social distance and physical distance. When asked to either indicate the spatial location of a presented word or verify a word’s presence, people respond more quickly when "we" was displayed in a spatially proximate versus spatially distant location and when "others" was displayed in a
spatially distant versus a spatially proximate location.&lt;ref&gt;Bar-Anan, Y., Liberman, N., Trope, Y., &amp; Algom, D. (2007). Automatic processing of psychological distance: Evidence from a Stroop task. ''Journal of Experimental Psychology: General, 136,'' 610-622.&lt;/ref&gt; This suggests that social distance and physical distance are conceptually related.

Route planning exercises have also hinted at a conceptual link between social distance and physical distance. When asked to draw a route on a map, people tend to draw routes closer to friends they pass along the way and further away from strangers.&lt;ref&gt;Matthews, J.L. &amp; Matlock, T. (2011). Understanding the link between spatial distance and social distance. ''Social Psychology, 42'', 185-192. {{doi|10.1027/1864-9335/a000062}}&lt;/ref&gt; This effect is robust even after controlling for how easy it is for the people passing one another to communicate. 

There is some evidence that reasoning about social distance and physical distance draw on shared processing resources in the human parietal cortex.&lt;ref&gt;Yamakawa, Y., Kanai, R., Matsumura, M., &amp; Naito, E. (2009). Social distance evaluation in human parietal cortex. PLoS ONE, 4(2): e4360. {{doi|10.1371/journal.pone.0004360}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[Core-periphery structure|Social periphery]]'' is a term often used in conjunction with social distance. It refers to people being 'distant' with regard to social relations. It is often implied that it is measured from the dominant ''city élite''. The social periphery of a city is often located in the [[city center|centre]].

''Locational periphery'' in contrast is used to describe places physically distant from the heart of the city. These places often include [[suburbia|suburbs]] which are socially close to the core of the city. In some cases the locational periphery overlaps with the social periphery, such as in [[Paris]]' ''[[banlieu|banlieues]]''.

In 1991, Mulgan stated that "The centres of two cities are often for practical purposes closer to each other than to their own peripheries."&lt;ref&gt;Mulgan G (1991) Communications and Control: Networks and the New Economics of Communication (Polity, Cambridge)&lt;/ref&gt; This reference to social distance is especially true for [[global cities]].

[[File:Jean Eugène Buland Almosen eines Bettlers 1880.jpg|thumb|An 1880 painting by [[Jean-Eugène Buland]] showing a stark contrast in socioeconomic status]]

'''Socioeconomic status''' ('''SES''') is an economic and sociological combined total measure of a person's work experience and of an individual's or family's economic and social position in relation to others, based on [[income]], [[education]], and occupation. When analyzing a family's SES, the household income, earners' [[education]], and occupation are examined, as well as combined income, whereas for an individual's SES only their own attributes are assessed. However, SES is more commonly used to depict an economic difference in society as a whole.&lt;ref&gt;National Center for Educational Statistics. 31 March 2008. http://nces.ed.gov/programs/coe/glossary/s.asp&lt;/ref&gt;

Socioeconomic status is typically broken into three levels (high, middle, and low) to describe the three places a family or an individual may fall into. When placing a family or individual into one of these categories, any or all of the three variables (income, education, and occupation) can be assessed.

Additionally, low income and education have been shown to be strong predictors of a range of physical and mental health problems, including respiratory viruses, [[arthritis]], coronary disease, and [[schizophrenia]]. These problems may be due to environmental conditions in their workplace, or, in the case of disabilities or mental illnesses, may be the entire cause of that person's social predicament to begin with.&lt;ref&gt;Goode, Erica (1 June 1999) [https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9806E5DA1230F932A35755C0A96F958260&amp;sec=&amp;spon=&amp;pagewanted=1 "For Good Health, it Helps to be Rich and important"] ''[[The New York Times]]''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Marmot, Michael. 2004. The Status Syndrome: How Social Standing Affects Our Health and Longevity. New York: Owl Books.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Werner, Shirli, Malaspina, Dolores, and Rabinowitz, Jonathan. Socioeconomic Status at Birth is Associated with Risk of Schizophrenia: Population-Based Multilevel Study. Schizophrenia Bulletin. 18 April 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=apa&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.apa.org/pi/ses/resources/publications/disability.aspx|title=Disability &amp; Socioeconomic Status|publisher=American Psychological Association}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Education in higher socioeconomic families is typically stressed as much more important, both within the household as well as the local community. In poorer areas, where food, shelter and safety are priority, education can take a backseat. Youth audiences are particularly at risk for many health and social problems in the United States, such as [[Unwanted pregnancy|unwanted pregnancies]], [[drug abuse]], and [[obesity]].&lt;ref&gt;Hunt, J (4 October 1972).

==Main factors==

===Income===
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Incomeinequality.jpg|thumb|This graph shows the differences in income between the top and bottom income earners in the United States.&lt;ref name=apa&gt;American Psychological Association, Task Force on Socioeconomic Status. Report of the APA Task Force on Socioeconomic Status. Washington, D.C.:
American Psychological Association, 2007.http://www2.apa.org/pi/SES_task_force_report.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;]] --&gt;

''Income'' refers to [[wage]]s, [[salaries]], [[Profit (accounting)|profits]], [[Renting|rents]], and any flow of earnings received. Income can also come in the form of [[unemployment]] or worker's compensation, social security, pensions, interests or dividends, royalties, trusts, alimony, or other governmental, public, or family financial assistance.

Income can be looked at in two terms, relative and absolute. Absolute income, as theorized by economist [[John Maynard Keynes]], is the relationship in which as income increases, so will consumption, but not at the same rate.&lt;ref&gt;Wisdom Supreme. 6 April 2008. http://www.wisdomsupreme.com/dictionary/absolute-income-hypothesis.php&lt;/ref&gt; [[relative poverty|Relative income]] dictates a person or family’s savings and consumption based on the family’s income in relation to others. Income is a commonly used measure of SES because it is relatively easy to figure for most individuals.

[[Income inequality]] is most commonly measured around the world by the [[Gini coefficient]], where 0 corresponds to perfect equality and 1 means perfect inequality. Low income families focus on meeting immediate needs and do not accumulate wealth that could be passed on to future generations, thus increasing inequality. Families with higher and expendable income can accumulate [[wealth]] and focus on meeting immediate needs while being able to consume and enjoy luxuries and weather crises.&lt;ref&gt;Boushey, Heather and Weller, Christian. (2005). Inequality Matters: The Growing Economic Divide in America and its Poisonous Consequences.. "What the Numbers Tell Us." Pp 27-40. Demos.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Education===
Education also plays a role in income. Median earnings increase with each level of [[education]]. As conveyed in the chart, the highest degrees, professional and doctoral degrees, make the highest weekly earnings while those without a high school diploma earn less. Higher levels of education are associated with better economic and psychological outcomes (i.e.: more income, more control, and greater social support and networking).&lt;ref name=apa/&gt;

Education plays a major role in skill sets for acquiring jobs, as well as specific qualities that stratify people with higher SES from lower SES. Annette Lareau speaks on the idea of [[concerted cultivation]], where [[middle class]] parents take an active role in their children’s education and development by using controlled organized activities and fostering a sense of entitlement through encouraged discussion. Laureau argues that families with lower income do not participate in this movement, causing their children to have a sense of constraint.  An interesting observation that studies have noted is that parents from lower SES households are more likely to give orders to their children in their interactions while parents with a higher SES are more likely to interact and play with their children.  A division in education attainment is thus born out of these two differences in child rearing.  Research has shown how children who are born in lower SES households have weaker language skills compared to children raised in higher SES households.  These language skills affect their abilities to learn and thus exacerbate the problem of education disparity between low and high SES neighborhoods.  Lower income families can have children who do not succeed to the levels of the middle income children, who can have a greater sense of entitlement, be more argumentative, or be better prepared for adult life.&lt;ref&gt;Lareau, Annette. (2003). Unequal Childhoods: Race, Class, and Family Life. University of California Press&lt;/ref&gt;

Research shows that lower SES students have lower and slower academic achievement as compared with students of higher SES.&lt;ref&gt;Staff (2012)  (2012) [http://www.apa.org/pi/ses/resources/publications/factsheet-education.aspx "Education &amp; Socioeconomic Status"] [[American Psychological Association]]&lt;/ref&gt; When teachers make judgments about students based on their class and SES, they are taking the first step in preventing students from having an equal opportunity for academic achievement.  Educators need to help overcome the stigma of poverty.  A student of low SES and low self-esteem should not be reinforced by educators.  Teachers need to view students as individuals and not as a member of an SES group.  Teachers looking at students in this manner will help them to not be prejudiced towards students of certain SES groups.&lt;ref name=chinn&gt;Gollnick, Donna M &amp; Chinn,Philip. (2013) ''Multicultural Education in a Pluralistic Society'' Pearson. {{ISBN|9781256639121}}&lt;/ref&gt; Raising the level of instruction can help to create equality in student achievement.  Teachers relating the content taught to students' prior knowledge and relating it to real world experiences can improve achievement.&lt;ref name=chinn /&gt; Educators also need to be open and discuss class and SES differences.  It is important that all are educated, understand, and be able to speak openly about SES.&lt;ref&gt;Stanek (2012) ''Talking About Class''&lt;/ref&gt;

===Occupation===
[[Occupational prestige]], as one component of SES, encompasses both income and [[educational attainment]]. Occupational status reflects the educational attainment required to obtain the job and income levels that vary with different jobs and within ranks of occupations. Additionally, it shows achievement in skills required for the job. Occupational status measures social position by describing job characteristics, decision making ability and control, and psychological demands on the job{{Citation needed|date=April 2017}}.

Occupations are ranked by the Census (among other organizations) and opinion polls from the general population are surveyed. Some of the most prestigious occupations are physicians and surgeons, lawyers, chemical and biomedical engineers, university professors, and communications analysts. These jobs, considered to be grouped in the high SES classification, provide more challenging work and greater control over working conditions but require more ability. The jobs with lower rankings include food preparation workers, counter attendants, bartenders and helpers, dishwashers, janitors, maids and housekeepers, vehicle cleaners, and parking lot attendants. The jobs that are less valued also offer significantly lower wages, and often are more laborious, very hazardous, and provide less autonomy.&lt;ref name=apa/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Scott, Janny and Leonhardt, David. "Class Matters: A Special Edition." New York Times 14 May 2005. https://www.nytimes.com/2005/05/14/national/class/15MOBILITY-WEB.html&lt;/ref&gt;

Occupation is the most difficult factor to measure because so many exist, and there are so many competing scales. Many scales rank occupations based on the level of skill involved, from unskilled to skilled manual labor to professional, or use a combined measure using the education level needed and income involved.

In sum, the majority of researchers agree that income, education and occupation together best represent SES, while some others feel that changes in family structure should also be considered.&lt;ref name="Milne, A. 2006"&gt;Milne, A., &amp; Plourde, L.

''Wealth'', a set of economic reserves or assets, presents a source of security providing a measure of a household's ability to meet emergencies, absorb economic shocks, or provide the means to live comfortably. Wealth reflects intergenerational transitions as well as accumulation of income and savings.&lt;ref name=apa/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;MacArthur Research Network on SES and Health. 31 March 2008. {{cite web |url=http://www.macses.ucsf.edu/Research/Social%20Environment/chapters.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2008-04-16 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080429190308/http://www.macses.ucsf.edu/Research/Social%20Environment/chapters.html |archivedate=29 April 2008 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Income, age, marital status, family size, religion, occupation, and education are all predictors for wealth attainment.

The wealth gap, like income inequality, is very large in the United States. [[Racial inequality in the United States|There exists a racial wealth gap]] due in part to income disparities and differences in achievement resulting from institutional discrimination. According to [[Thomas Shapiro]], differences in savings (due to different rates of incomes), inheritance factors, and discrimination in the housing market lead to the racial wealth gap. Shapiro claims that savings increase with increasing income, but African Americans cannot participate in this, because they make significantly less than Americans of European descent (whites). Additionally, rates of inheritance dramatically differ between African Americans and Americans of European descent. The amount a person inherits, either during a lifetime or after death, can create different starting points between two different individuals or families. These different starting points also factor into housing, education, and [[employment discrimination]]. A third reason Shapiro offers for the racial wealth gap are the various discriminations African Americans must face, like [[redlining]] and higher interest rates in the housing market. These types of discrimination feed into the other reasons why African Americans end up having different starting points and therefore fewer assets.&lt;ref&gt;Shapiro, Thomas. (2004).

===Health===
{{Refimprove section|date=April 2016}}
Recently, there has been increasing interest from [[epidemiology|epidemiologists]] on the subject of [[economic inequality]] and its relation to the [[Population health|health of populations]].  Socioeconomic status has long been related to health, those higher in the social hierarchy typically enjoy better health than do those below.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Adler|first=Nancy E.|last2=Boyce|first2=Thomas|last3=Chesney|first3=Margaret A.|last4=Cohen|first4=Sheldon|last5=Folkman|first5=Susan|last6=Kahn|first6=Robert L.|last7=Syme|first7=S. Leonard|title=Socioeconomic status and health: The challenge of the gradient.|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1037/0003-066X.49.1.15|journal=American Psychologist|language=en|volume=49|issue=1|pages=15–24|doi=10.1037/0003-066x.49.1.15}}&lt;/ref&gt; Socioeconomic status is an important source of [[Health equity|health inequity]], as there is a very robust positive correlation between socioeconomic status and health, other than for male [[homosexuals]]. This correlation suggests that it is not only the poor who tend to be sick when everyone else is healthy, but that there is a continual gradient, from the top to the bottom of the socio-economic ladder, relating status to health. Parents with a low socioeconomic status cannot afford many of the health care resources which is the reason that their children may have a more advanced illness because of the lack of treatment.&lt;ref name="Bradley 371&amp;issn=0066-4308"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Bradley|first=Robert|title=Socioeconomic Status and Child Development|url=http://bf3aw9bu9y.scholar.serialssolutions.com/?sid=google&amp;auinit=RH&amp;aulast=Bradley&amp;atitle=Socioeconomic+status+and+child+development&amp;id=doi:10.1146/annurev.psych.53.100901.135233&amp;title=Annual+review+of+psychology&amp;volume=53&amp;issue=1&amp;date=2002&amp;spage=371&amp;issn=0066-4308|journal=Annual Review of Psychology|volume=53|doi=10.1146/annurev.psych.53.100901.135233}}&lt;/ref&gt; This phenomenon is often called the "SES Gradient" or according to the World Health Organisation the "Social Gradient". Lower socioeconomic status has been linked to chronic [[Stress (medicine)|stress]], [[heart disease]], [[Peptic ulcer|ulcers]], [[type 2 diabetes]], [[rheumatoid arthritis]], certain types of [[cancer]], and [[premature aging]].

There is debate regarding the cause of the SES Gradient. Researchers see a definite link between economic status and mortality due to the greater economic resources of the wealthy, but they find little correlation due to [[social status]] differences.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/db06/686885a73827c13bacb16816c261084f12ac.pdf|title=The Oxford Handbook of Economic Inequality|year=2009|isbn=9780199606061|editors=Nolan, B., Salverda, W., &amp; Smeeding, T.M.|location=|pages=|authors=Leigh, A., Jencks, C., &amp; Smeeding, T.M.|access-date=13 March 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170314151908/https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/db06/686885a73827c13bacb16816c261084f12ac.pdf|archive-date=14 March 2017|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other researchers such as [[Richard G. Wilkinson]], J. Lynch, and G.A. Kaplan have found that socioeconomic status strongly affects health even when controlling for economic resources and access to health care.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=[[The Spirit Level: Why More Equal Societies Almost Always Do Better]] |last=Wilkinson |first=Richard |authorlink= |author2=Pickett, Kate |year=2009 |publisher=Allen Lane |location= |isbn=978-1-84614-039-6 |page=352}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most famous for linking social status with health are the [[Whitehall Study|Whitehall studies]]—a series of studies conducted on [[civil servants]] in [[London]]. The studies found that although all civil servants in England have the same access to health care, there was a strong correlation between social status and health. The studies found that this relationship remained strong even when controlling for health-affecting habits such as [[exercise]], [[Tobacco smoking|smoking]] and [[Alcoholic beverage|drinking]]. Furthermore, it has been noted that no amount of medical attention will help decrease the likelihood of someone getting [[type 2 diabetes]] or [[rheumatoid arthritis]]—yet both are more common among populations with lower socioeconomic status.

There is no significant relationship between SES and stress during pregnancy, while there is a significant relationship with a husband's occupational status&lt;ref name="Sara Shishehgar 2014"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Shishehgar | first1 = Sara | last2 = Dolatian | first2 = Mahrokh | last3 = Alavi Majd | first3 = Hamid | last4 = Bakhtiary | first4 = Maryam | year = 2014 | title = Socioeconomic Status and Stress Rate during Pregnancy in Iran | url = | journal = Global Journal of Health Science | volume = 6 | issue = 4 | doi=10.5539/gjhs.v6n4p254}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

===Language development===
{{Expand section|date=February 2016}}

====Home environment====

The environment of low SES children is characterized by less dialogue from parents, minimal amounts of book reading, and few instances of [[joint attention]], the shared focus of the child and adult on the same object or event, when compared to the environment of high SES children. In contrast, infants from high SES families experience more child-directed speech. At 10 months, children of high SES hear on average 400 more words than their low SES peers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Hart|first=Betty|title=Meaningful Differences in the Everyday Experience of Young American Children|year=1995}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Language ability differs sharply as a function of SES, for example, the average vocabulary size of 3-year-old children from professional families was more than twice as large as for those on welfare.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1364661308002635|title=Socioeconomic status and the developing brain|last=Hackman|first=Daniel|date=8 January 2009|journal=Trends in Cognitive Sciences|access-date=25 October 2016|doi=10.1016/j.tics.2008.11.003|volume=13|pages=65–73|pmid=19135405|pmc=3575682}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Children from lower income households had greater media access in their bedrooms but lower access to portable play equipment compared to higher income children.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Tandon|first=Pooja S.|last2=Zhou|first2=Chuan|last3=Sallis|first3=James F.|last4=Cain|first4=Kelli L.|last5=Frank|first5=Lawrence D.|last6=Saelens|first6=Brian E.|date=2012-01-01|title=Home environment relationships with children’s physical activity, sedentary time, and screen time by socioeconomic status|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1186/1479-5868-9-88|journal=International Journal of Behavioral Nutrition and Physical Activity|volume=9|pages=88|doi=10.1186/1479-5868-9-88|issn=1479-5868|pmc=3413573|pmid=22835155}}&lt;/ref&gt; This eventually leads children from lower socioeconomic backgrounds to be at a disadvantage when comparing them with their counterparts in terms of access to physical activities.

====Parental interactions====

In addition to the amount of language input from parents, SES heavily influences the type of [[Parenting styles|parenting style]] a family chooses to practice. These different parenting styles shape the tone and purpose of verbal interactions between parent and child. For example, parents of high SES tend toward more [[Authoritative Parenting|authoritative]] or [[Permissive Parenting|permissive parenting]] styles.&lt;ref name= "Hoff"&gt;{{cite book|title=Handbook of parenting: Volume 2, Biology and ecology of parenting|year=2002|publisher=Lawrence Erlbaum Association|location=Mahwah, NJ|pages=231–252|author=Hoff, E.|authorlink=Socioeconomic Status and Parenting|author2=Laursen, B. |author3=Tardif, T |editor=M. Bornstein}}&lt;/ref&gt; These parents pose more open-ended questions to their children to encourage the latter’s speech growth.&lt;ref name=Clark&gt;{{cite book|last=Clark|first=Eve|title=First Language Acquisition|year=2009|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=New York, NY|isbn=978-0-521-51413-2|pages=44–46}}&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast, parents of low SES tend toward more [[Authoritarian Parent|authoritarian styles]] of address. Their conversations with their children contain more [[Imperative mood|imperatives]] and yes/no questions that inhibits child responses and speech development.&lt;ref name=Clark/&gt;

Parental differences in addressing children may be traced to the position of their respective groups within society. Working class individuals often hold low power, subordinate positions in the occupational world. This standing in the social [[hierarchy]] requires a personality and interaction style that is relational and capable of adjusting to circumstances.&lt;ref name=Markus&gt;{{cite book|title=Clash!: 8 cultural conflicts that make us who we are|year=2013|publisher=Hudson Street Press|location=New York, NY|isbn=1101623608|pages=89–112|author=Markus, H.|authorlink=Class acts: Socioeconomic cultures|author2=Conner, A}}&lt;/ref&gt; An [[Authoritarian Parent|authoritarian style]] of address prepares children for these types of roles, which require a more accommodating and compliant personality. Therefore, low SES parents see the family as more hierarchical, with the parents at the top of the power structure, which shapes verbal interaction.&lt;ref name=Kusserow&gt;{{cite journal|last=Kusserow|first=A|title=De-Homogenizing American Individualism: Socializing Hard and Soft Individualism in Manhattan and Queens|journal=Ethos|year=1999|volume=27|issue=2|pages=210–234|doi=10.1525/eth.1999.27.2.210}}&lt;/ref&gt; This power differential emulates the circumstances of the working class world, where individuals are ranked and discouraged from questioning authority.

Conversely, high SES individuals occupy high power positions that call for greater expressivity. High SES parents encourage their children to question the world around them.&lt;ref name=Markus/&gt; In addition to asking their children more questions, these parents push their children to create questions of their own.&lt;ref name= "Hoff"/&gt; In contrast with low SES parents, these individuals often view the power disparity between parent and child as detrimental to the family. Opting instead to treat children as equals, high SES conversations are characterized by a give and take between parent and child.&lt;ref name=Kusserow/&gt; These interactions help prepare these children for occupations that require greater expressivity.

===Disparities in language acquisition===
The linguistic environment of low and high SES children differs substantially, which affects many aspects of language and literacy development such as semantics, syntax, morphology, and phonology.

==== Semantics ====

Semantics is the study of the meaning of words and phrases. Semantics covers vocabulary, which is affected by SES. 
Children of high SES have larger expressive vocabularies by the age of 24 months due to more efficient processing of familiar words. By age 3, there are significant differences in the amount of dialogue and vocabulary growth between children of low and high SES.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Hart|first=Beety|title=Meaningful Differences in the Everyday Experience of Young American Children|year=1995}}&lt;/ref&gt; A lack of joint attention in children contributes to poor vocabulary growth when compared to their high SES peers. Joint attention and book reading are important factors that affect children’s vocabulary growth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Farrant|first=Brad|author2=Stephen Zubrick|title=Early vocabulary development: The importance of joint attention and parent-child book reading|journal=First Language|year=2012|pages=343–364}}&lt;/ref&gt; With joint attention, a child and adult can focus on the same object, allowing the child to map out words. For example, a child sees an animal running outside and the mom points to it and says, "Look, a dog." The child will focus its attention to where its mother is pointing and map the word dog to the pointed animal. Joint attention thus facilitates word learning for children.

==== Syntax ====

[[Syntax]] refers to the arrangement of words and phrases to form sentences. SES affects the production of sentence structures. Although 22- to 44-month-old children’s production of [[simple sentence]] structures does not vary by SES, low SES does contribute to difficulty with [[complex sentence]] structures. Complex sentences include sentences that have more than one [[verb phrase]]. An example of a complex sentence is, "I want you to sit there".&lt;ref name="Vasilyeva 2008 84–97"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Vasilyeva|first=Marina|author2=Heidi Waterfall |author3=Janellen Huttenlocher |title=Emergence of syntax: Commonalities and differences across children|journal=Developmental Science|year=2008|pages=84–97|doi=10.1111/j.1467-7687.2007.00656.x|volume=11}}&lt;/ref&gt; The emergence of simple sentence structures is seen as a structure that is obligatory in everyday speech. Complex sentence structures are optional and can only be mastered if the environment fosters its development.&lt;ref name="Vasilyeva 2008 84–97"/&gt;

This lag in the sentence formation abilities of low SES children may be caused by less frequent exposure to complex syntax through parental speech. Low SES parents ask fewer response-coaxing questions of their children which limits the opportunities of these children to practice more complex speech patterns.&lt;ref name=Hoff/&gt; Instead, these parents give their children more direct orders, which has been found to negatively influence the acquisition of more difficult [[Noun phrase|noun]] and [[verb phrase]]s.&lt;ref name=Clark/&gt; In contrast, high SES households ask their children broad questions to cultivate speech development. Exposure to more questions positively contributes to children’s vocabulary growth and complex noun phrase constructions.&lt;ref name=Clark/&gt;

==== Morphology ====

Children’s grasp of morphology, the study of how words are formed, is affected by SES. Children of high SES have advantages in applying grammatical rules, such as the pluralization of nouns and adjectives compared to children of low SES. Pluralizing nouns consists of understanding that some nouns are regular and -s denotes more than one, but also understanding how to apply different rules to irregular nouns. Learning and understanding how to use plural rules is an important tool in conversation and writing. In order to communicate successfully that there is more than one dog running down the street, an -s must be added to dog. Research also finds that the gap in ability to pluralize nouns and adjectives does not diminish by age or schooling because low SES children’s reaction times to pluralize nouns and adjectives do not decrease.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Ravid|first=Dorit|author2=Rachel Schiff|title=Ravid, D., &amp; Schiff, R. (2009). Morphophonological categories of noun plurals in Hebrew: A developmental study|journal=Linguistics|year=2012|pages=45–63}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Phonology ====

Phonological awareness, the ability to recognize that words are made up different sound units, is also affected by SES. Children of low SES between the second and sixth grades are found to have low phonological awareness. The gap in phonological awareness increases by grade level.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Schiff|first=Rachel|author2=Einav Lotem|title=Schiff, R., &amp; Lotem, E. (2011). Effects of phonological and morphological awareness on children’s word reading development from two socioeconomic backgrounds|journal=First Language|year=2012|pages=139–163}}&lt;/ref&gt; This gap is even more problematic if children of low SES are already born with low levels of phonological awareness and their environment does not foster its growth. Children who have high phonological awareness from an early age are not affected by SES.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Noble|first=Kimberley|author2=Michael Wolmetz |author3=Lisa Ochs |author4=Martha Farah |author5=Bruce McCandliss |title=Brain–behavior relationships in reading acquisition are modulated by socioeconomic factors|journal=Developmental Science|year=2006|pages=642–654|doi=10.1111/j.1467-7687.2006.00542.x |volume=9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Positive outcomes of low SES ====

Given the large amount of research on the setbacks children of low SES face, there is a push by child developmental researchers to steer research to a more positive direction regarding low SES. The goal is to highlight the strengths and assets low income families possess in raising children. For example, African American preschoolers of low SES exhibit strengths in oral narrative, or storytelling, that may promote later success in reading. These children have better narrative comprehension when compared to peers of higher SES.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Gardner-Neblett|first=Nicole|author2=Elisabeth Pungello |author3=Iheoma Iruka |title=Oral narrative skills: Implications for the reading development of African American children|journal=Child Development Perspectives|year=2012|pages=218–224}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Literacy development===
A gap in reading growth exists between low SES and high SES children, which widens as children move on to higher grades. Reading assessments that test reading growth include measures on basic reading skills (i.e., print familiarity, letter recognition, beginning and ending sounds, rhyming sounds, word recognition), vocabulary (receptive vocabulary), and reading comprehension skills (i.e., listening comprehension, words in context).&lt;ref name="Benson &amp; Borman, 2010"&gt;{{cite journal|author=Benson, J., Borman, G.|title=Family, Neighborhood, and School Settings Across Seasons: When Do Socioeconomic Context and Racial Composition Matter for the Reading Achievement Growth of Young Children?|journal=Teachers College Record|year=2010|volume=112|issue=5|pages=1338–1390}}&lt;/ref&gt; The reading growth gap is apparent between the spring of kindergarten and the spring of first-grade, the time when children rely more on the school for reading growth and less on their parents. Initially, high SES children begin as better readers than their low SES counterparts. As children get older, high SES children progress more rapidly in reading growth rates than low SES children. These early reading outcomes affect later academic success. The further children fall behind, the more difficult it is to catch up and the more likely they will continue to fall behind. By the time students enter high school in the United States, low SES children are considerably behind their high SES peers in reading growth.&lt;ref name="Aikens &amp; Barbarin, 2008"&gt;{{cite journal|author=Aikens, N., Barbarin, O.|title=Socioeconomic Differences in Reading Trajectories: The Contribution of Family, Neighborhood, and School Contexts|journal=Journal of Educational Psychology|year=2010|volume=100|issue=2|pages=235–251|doi=10.1037/0022-0663.100.2.235}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Home environment====

Home environment is one of the leading factors of a child's well being. Children living in a poor home with inadequate living conditions are more likely to be susceptible to illness and injuries.&lt;ref name="Bradley 371&amp;issn=0066-4308"/&gt; The disparities in experiences in the home environment children of high and low SES affect reading outcomes. The home environment is considered the main contributor to SES reading outcomes.&lt;ref name= "Aikens &amp; Barbarin, 2008"/&gt; Children of low SES status are read to less often and have fewer books in the home than their high SES peers, which suggests an answer to why children of low SES status have lower initial reading scores than their high SES counterparts upon entering kindergarten.&lt;ref name= "Aikens &amp; Barbarin, 2008"/&gt; &lt;ref name= "Evans, 2004). Low SES parents are also less involved in their children’s schooling.&lt;ref name="Evans, 2004"&gt;{{cite journal|author=Evans, G.|title=The Environment of Childhood Poverty|journal=American Psychologist|year=2004|volume=59|issue=2|pages=77–92|doi=10.1037/0003-066X.59.2.77|pmid=14992634}}&lt;/ref&gt;
       
The home environment makes the largest contribution to the prediction of initial kindergarten reading disparities. Characteristics of the home environment include home literacy environment and parental involvement in school. Home literacy environment is characterized by the frequency with which parents engage in joint book reading with the child, the frequency with which children read books outside of school, and the frequency with which household members visited the library with the child. Parental involvement in school is characterized by attending a parent–teacher conference, attending a parent–teacher association (PTA) meeting, attending an open house, volunteering, participating in fundraising, and attending a school event. Resources, experiences, and relationships associated with the family are most closely associated with reading gaps when students reading levels are first assessed in kindergarten. The influence of family factors on initial reading level may be due to children experiencing little schooling before kindergarten—they mainly have their families to rely on for their reading growth.&lt;ref name= "Aikens &amp; Barbarin, 2008"/&gt;

Family SES is also associated with reading achievement growth during the summer. Students from high SES families continue to grow in their ability to read after kindergarten and students from low SES families fall behind in their reading growth at a comparable amount. Additionally, the summer setback disproportionately affects African American and Hispanic students because they are more likely than White students to come from low SES families. Also, low SES families typically lack the appropriate resources to continue reading growth when school is not in session.&lt;ref name= "Benson &amp; Borman, 2010"/&gt;

====Neighborhood influence====

The neighborhood setting in which children grow up contributes to reading disparities between low and high SES children. These neighborhood qualities include but are not limited to garbage or litter in the street, individuals selling or using drugs in the street, burglary or robbery in the area, violent crime in the area, vacant homes in the area, and how safe it is to play in the neighborhood. Low SES children are more likely to grow up in such neighborhood conditions than their high SES peers. Community support for the school and poor physical conditions surrounding the school are also associated with children’s reading. Neighborhood factors help explain the variation in reading scores in school entry, and especially as children move on to higher grades. As low SES children in poor neighborhood environments get older, they fall further behind their high SES peers in reading growth and thus have a more difficult time developing reading skills at grade level.&lt;ref name= "Aikens &amp; Barbarin, 2008"/&gt;

In a study by M. Keels, it was determined that when low-income families are moved from poor neighborhoods to suburban neighborhoods, there are reductions in delinquency in children.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Santiago|first=Catherine DeCarlo|last2=Wadsworth|first2=Martha E.|last3=Stump|first3=Jessica|date=2011-03-01|title=Socioeconomic status, neighborhood disadvantage, and poverty-related stress: Prospective effects on psychological syndromes among diverse low-income families|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0167487009001093|journal=Journal of Economic Psychology|series=Special Issue on The Psychology and Behavioural Economics of Poverty|volume=32|issue=2|pages=218–230|doi=10.1016/j.joep.2009.10.008}}&lt;/ref&gt;  When comparing different social statuses of families, the environment of a neighborhood turns out to be major factor in contributing to the growth of a child.

====School influence====

School characteristics, including characteristics of peers and teachers, contribute to reading disparities between low and high SES children. For instance, peers play a role in influencing early reading proficiency. In low SES schools, there are higher concentrations of less skilled, lower SES, and minority peers who have lower gains in reading. The number of children reading below grade and the presence of low-income peers were consistently associated with initial achievement and growth rates. Low SES peers tend to have limited skills and fewer economic resources than high SES children, which makes it difficult for children to grow in their reading ability. The most rapid growth of reading ability happens between the spring of kindergarten and the spring of first grade. Teacher experience (number of years teaching  at a particular school and the number of years teaching a particular grade level), teacher preparation to teach (based on the number of courses taken on early education, elementary education, and child development), the highest degree earned, and the number of courses taken on teaching reading all determine whether or not a reading teacher is qualified. Low SES students are more likely to have less qualified teachers, which is associated with their reading growth rates being significantly lower than the growth rates of their high SES counterparts.&lt;ref name= "Aikens &amp; Barbarin, 2008"/&gt;

===Influences on nonverbal behavior===
Michael Kraus and Dacher Keltner, in their study published in the December 2008 issue of ''Psychological Science,'' found that children of parents with a high SES tended to express more disengagement behaviors than their peers of low SES. In this context, disengagement behaviors included self-grooming, fidgeting with nearby objects, and doodling while being addressed. In contrast, engagement behaviors included head nods, eyebrow raises, laughter and gazes at one’s partner. These cues indicated an interest in one’s partner and the desire to deepen and enhance the relationship. Participants of low SES tended to express more engagement behaviors toward their conversational partners, while their high SES counterparts displayed more disengagement behaviors. Authors hypothesized that, as SES rises, the capacity to fulfill one’s needs also increases. This may lead to greater feelings of independence, making individuals of high SES less inclined to gain [[rapport]] with conversational partners because they are less likely to need their assistance in the future.&lt;ref name=Kraus2008&gt;{{citation

'''Sportsmanship''' is an aspiration or ethos that a [[sport]] or activity will be enjoyed for its own sake, with proper consideration for [[wikt:fairness|fairness]], [[ethics]], [[respect]], and a sense of [[fellow]]ship with one's competitors. A "sore loser" refers to one who does not take defeat well, whereas a "good sport" means being a "good winner" as well as being a "good loser"&lt;ref&gt;See, ''e.g.'', Joel Fish and Susan Magee, ''101 Ways to Be a Terrific Sports Parent'', p. 168. Fireside, 2003.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;David Lacey, [http://blogs.guardian.co.uk/sport/2007/11/10/it_takes_a_bad_loser_to_become.html "It takes a bad loser to become a good winner."] ''The Guardian'', November 10, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; (someone who shows courtesy towards another in a sports game).

== Analysis ==

Sportsmanship can be conceptualized as an enduring and relatively stable characteristic or disposition such that individuals differ in the way they are generally expected to behave in sports situations. In general, sportsmanship refers to virtues such as fairness, self-control, courage, and persistence,&lt;ref name="Shields &amp; Bredemeier, 1995"&gt;Shields &amp; Bredemeier, 1995.&lt;/ref&gt; and has been associated with interpersonal concepts of treating others and being treated fairly, maintaining self-control if dealing with others, and respect for both authority and opponents. Sportsmanship is also looked at as being the way one 
reacts to a sport/game/player.

The four elements of sportsmanship are often shown being good form, the will to win, equity and fairness. All four elements are critical and a balance must be found among all four for true sportsmanship to be illustrated.&lt;ref name="abad" /&gt; These elements may also cause conflict, as a person may desire to win more than play in equity and fairness and thus resulting in a clash within the aspects of sportsmanship. This will cause problems as the person believes they are being a good sportsman, but they are defeating the purpose of this idea as they are ignoring two key components of being sportsman like. When athletes become too self-centred, the idea of sportsmanship is dismissed.&lt;ref name="ahola"&gt;{{Cite journal|url=http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/07303084.2006.10597902|title =Promoting Sportsmanship in Youth Sports|last1 = Goldstein |first1=Jay|last2=Iso-Ahola |first2 = Seppo|date = 2006|journal =Journal of Physical Education, Recreation &amp; Dance|doi = 10.1080/07303084.2006.10597902|issue = 7|volume = 77}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Today's sporting culture, in particular the base of elite sport, places great importance on the idea of competition and winning and thus sportsmanship takes a back seat as a result.&lt;ref name="ahola" /&gt; In most, if not all sports, sportsmen at the elite level make the standards on sportsmanship and no matter whether they like it or not, they are seen as leaders and role models in society.&lt;ref name="clifford"&gt;{{cite journal |first=Ken |last=Clifford |journal=Newcastle Herald |date=2013 |title=Sport's also about sportsmanship |volume=1 |issue=33 |url=http://bv8ja7kw5x.search.serialssolutions.com/?ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;ctx_enc=info%3Aofi%2Fenc%3AUTF-8&amp;rfr_id=info:sid/summon.serialssolutions.com&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:journal&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.atitle=Sport%27s+also+about+sportsmanship&amp;rft.jtitle=Newcastle+Herald&amp;rft.au=KEN+CLIFFORD&amp;rft.date=2013-12-10&amp;rft.pub=Fairfax+Digital&amp;rft.issn=0727-9825&amp;rft.spage=33&amp;rft.externalDocID=3149922301&amp;paramdict=en-AU}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since every sport is rule driven, the most common offence of bad sportsmanship is the act of cheating or breaking the rules to gain an unfair advantage this is called [[unsportsmanlike conduct]].&lt;ref name="feez"&gt;{{Cite journal|url=http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/00948705.1986.9714436|title = Sportsmanship|last = Feezell|first = Randolph|date = 1986|journal = Journal of the Philosophy of Sport|doi = 10.1080/00948705.1986.9714436|issue = 1|volume = 13}}&lt;/ref&gt; A competitor who exhibits poor sportsmanship after losing a game or contest is often called a "sore loser", while a competitor who exhibits poor sportsmanship after winning is typically called a "bad winner". Sore loser behavior includes blaming others for the loss, not accepting responsibility for personal actions that contributed to the defeat, reacting to the loss in an immature or improper fashion, [[rationalization (psychology)|making excuses]] for the defeat, and citing unfavorable conditions or other petty issues as reasons for the defeat.&lt;ref&gt;"MJD", [https://sports.yahoo.com/nfl/blog/shutdown_corner/post/If-he-s-going-to-lose-Bill-Belichick-would-rath?urn=nfl,64971 "If he's going to lose, Bill Belichick would rather be elsewhere"]. Yahoo Sports, February 3, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;E-releases, [http://www.ereleases.com/prfuel/super-winners-and-losers/ "Super Winners and Losers"] ("The Patriots' coach was eviscerated by sports pundits for leaving the field before the game was actually finished.")&lt;/ref&gt; A bad winner acts in a shallow fashion after his or her victory, such as by gloating about his or her win, rubbing the win in the face(s) of the opponent(s), and lowering the opponent(s)'s [[self-esteem]] by constantly reminding the opponent(s) of "poor" performance in comparison (even if the opponent(s) competed well). Not showing respect to the other team is considered to being a bad sportsman and could lead to demoralising effects; as Leslie Howe describes: "If a pitcher in baseball decides to pitch not to his maximum ability suggest that the batter is not at an adequate level, [it] could lead to the batter to have low self-confidence or worth."&lt;ref name="howe"&gt;{{Cite journal|url = http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/00948705.2004.9714661|title =Gamesmanship|last = Howe|first = Leslie|date = 2008|journal = Journal of the Philosophy of Sport|doi = 10.1080/00948705.2004.9714661|issue = 2|volume = 31 |pp=212–225}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are six different categories relating to sportsmanship: the elements of sports, the elements of sportsmanship, clarifications, conflicts, balance and irreducibility.&lt;ref name="abad" /&gt; All six of these characterize a person with good sportsmanship. Even though there is some affinity between some of the categories, they are distinct elements.&lt;ref name="abad"&gt;{{Cite journal|url = http://www.tandfonline.com.ipacez.nd.edu.au/doi/full/10.1080/17511320903365227#abstract|title = Sportsmanship|last = Abad|first = Diana|date = 2010|journal = Sport, Ethics and Philosophy|doi = 10.1080/17511320903365227|issue = 1|volume = 4}}&lt;/ref&gt; "In essence, play has for its directed and immediate end joy, pleasure, and delights and which is dominated by a spirit of moderation and generosity. Athletics, on the other hand, is essentially a competitive activity, which has for its end victory in the contest and which is characterized of dedication, sacrifice and intensity." (Feelezz, 1896, pp.&amp;nbsp;3) Hence, the virtues of a player are radically different from the virtues of an athlete. (Feelezz, 1896, pp.&amp;nbsp;3). When talking about misunderstanding sportsmanship, Rudd and Stoll (2013) provide an example from 1995, a U.S. high school athletic league banned the post-game handshake that was a part of sports such as football and basketball. The handshaking was banned because of fights that were ensuing after the handshake.(pp.&amp;nbsp;41) Most players are influenced by the leaders around them such as coaches and older players, ''if there are coaches and administrators who don't understand sportsmanship, then what about the players?''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = http://www.tandfonline.com.ipacez.nd.edu.au/doi/pdf/10.1080/07303084.1998.10605629|title = Understanding Sportsmanship|last = Rudd; Stoll|first = Andrew; Sharon K|date = 2013|journal = Journal of Education, Recreation &amp; Dance|p=41|doi = 10.1080/07303084.1998.10605629|volume = 69|issue = 9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Examples ==
[[File:Sportmanship sculpture.jpg|thumb|A moment of sportmanship when [[John Landy]] helped [[Ron Clarke]] get up after he had fallen.]]

There are various ways that sportsmanship is practiced in different sports. Being a good sport often includes treating others as you would also like to be treated, cheer for good plays (even if it is made by the opposition), accept responsibility for your mistakes, and keep your perspective.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Bachel|first1=Beverly|title=Scoring big: It's not whether you win or lose, it's how you play|journal=Current Health 2, a Weekly Reader Publication|date=2009|volume=35|issue=7|pages=16–20|url=http://bv8ja7kw5x.search.serialssolutions.com/?ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;ctx_enc=info%3Aofi%2Fenc%3AUTF-8&amp;rfr_id=info:sid/summon.serialssolutions.com&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:journal&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.atitle=Scoring+big%3A+it%27s+not+whether+you+win+or+lose%2C+it%27s+how+you+play&amp;rft.jtitle=Current+Health+2%2C+a+Weekly+Reader+publication&amp;rft.au=Bachel%2C+Beverly&amp;rft.date=2009-03-01&amp;rft.pub=Weekly+Reader+Corp&amp;rft.issn=0163-156X&amp;rft.volume=35&amp;rft.issue=7&amp;rft.spage=16&amp;rft.externalDBID=n%2Fa&amp;rft.externalDocID=194620867&amp;paramdict=en-US|accessdate=April 13, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; An example of treating others how you would like to be treated would include being respectful and polite to other team members and the opposition because in return you would also like to be treated the same way.&lt;ref name="clifford" /&gt; Cheer for good plays could include if in netball a player of the opposition made a good lead for the ball, which then resulted in a goal, everyone would either clap or make a supportive comment to acknowledge that what the player did was very well done. To accept responsibility for your mistakes will entail not placing the blame on other people.&lt;ref name="feez" /&gt;

Some popular examples of good sportsmanship include shaking hands, help an opponent who may have fallen over, encourage everyone, cheer, clap or hi-five, and be respectful to everyone including teammates, the opposition, parents and officials.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Josephson|first1=Michael|title=Ethics and sportsmanship (part I)|url=https://charactercounts.org/sports/Olympic/olympic-report-ethicssportsmanship.htm|website=Pursuing Victory with Honor|accessdate=April 13, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most importantly it is often encouraged and said regarding sportsmanship that "It's not whether you win or lose, it's how you play the game."&lt;ref name="feez" /&gt;

Sportsmanship can be manifested in different ways depending on the game itself or the culture of the group.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://bigthink.com/ideafeed/concepts-of-sportsmanship-vary-across-cultures|title=Concepts of Sportsmanship Vary Across Cultures|first=Dustin|last=Petzold|date=|website=bigthink.com|accessdate=April 2, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Contributing factors ==

Sportsmanship can be affected by a few contributing factors such as the players' values and attitudes towards the sport and also the professional role models that are shown to the public. Role models in sport are expected to act in a moral and respectful way.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Jones|first1=Carwyn|title=Drunken role models: Rescuing our sporting exemplars|journal=Sport, Ethics and Philosophy|date=2011|volume=5|issue=4|pages=414–432|doi=10.1080/17511321.2011.561254}}&lt;/ref&gt; When elite sporting role models do not encourage sportsmanship this can also encourage people in society to act in similar ways to the athletes that they look up to and idolize. For example, if an individual looked up to an athlete who was drinking excessively, they may see this as acceptable behavior.&lt;ref name="ahola" /&gt; The direct correlation between sportsmanship and leadership is also considered to be another contributing factor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Wells|first1=M. S.|title=Creating an environment for sportsmanship outcomes: A systems perspective|journal=Journal of Physical Education, Recreation &amp; Dance|date=2006|volume=77|issue=7|pages=1–58}}&lt;/ref&gt; Having a positive environment in your sporting team will therefore create good sportsmanship from the individuals. Having a positive leadership by the captains, coaches and supporters would then encourage a positive sporting environment.&lt;ref name="ahola" /&gt;

The '''state of nature''' is a concept used in [[Ethics|moral]] and [[political philosophy]], [[religion]], [[social contract]] theories and international law&lt;ref&gt;[[Emer de Vattel]], ''The Law of Nations'', Preliminaries. Idea and General Principles. §4.&lt;/ref&gt; to denote the hypothetical conditions of what the lives of people might have been like before [[Society#Conceptions|societies]] came into existence. Philosophers of the state of nature theory deduce that there must have been a time before [[Society#Conceptions|organized societies]] existed, and this presumption thus raises questions such as: "What was life like before [[civil society]]?"; "How did government first emerge from such a starting position?," and; "What are the hypothetical reasons for entering a state of society by establishing a nation-state?".

In some versions of social contract theory, there are no rights in the state of nature, only freedoms, and it is the contract that creates rights and obligations. In other versions the opposite occurs: the contract imposes restrictions upon individuals that curtail their [[natural rights]].

Societies existing before or without a [[state (polity)|political state]] are currently studied in such fields as [[paleolithic]] [[history]], and the anthropological subfields of [[archaeology]], [[cultural anthropology]], [[social anthropology]], and [[ethnology]], which investigate the social and power-related structures of [[indigenous peoples|indigenous]] and [[uncontacted peoples]] living in [[Tribe|tribal communities]].

== Noted philosophers ==

=== Mozi (墨子)  ===
The early [[Warring States period|Warring States]] philosopher [[Mozi]] was the first thinker in ancient China to develop an ideal state of nature as a premise to defend the need of a single ruler in a state. According to him, on that state each person have their own moral (yi:義). As a result, people were unable to reach agreements and resources were wasted. Since his philosophy promotes the actions that leads to the benefit (li:利) of the state, such natural organization was rejected:&lt;blockquote&gt;"In the beginning of human life, when there was yet no law and government, the custom was "everybody according to his moral (yi:義)." Accordingly each man had his own moral, two men had two different morals and ten men had ten different morals -- the more people the more different notions. And everybody approved of his own moral and disapproved the views of others, and so arose mutual disapproval among men. As a result, father and son and elder and younger brothers became enemies and were estranged from each other, since they were unable to reach any agreement. Everybody worked for the disadvantage of the others with water, fire, and poison. Surplus energy was not spent for mutual aid; surplus goods were allowed to rot without sharing; excellent teachings (dao:道) were kept secret and not revealed." Chapter 3 - 1&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://ctext.org/mozi/identification-with-the-superior-i/ens|title=Mozi|last=Adapted from Mei translation of the|first=|date=|website=Ctext|archive-url=|archivedate=|dead-url=|accessdate=18 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;His proposal was to unify morals according to a single [[Fa (concept)|standard]] (fa:法) that can be used by anyone: calculating benefit of each act. In that way, the ruler of the state and his subjects will have the same morals; cooperation and joint efforts will be the rule. Later his proposal was strongly rejected by [[confucianism]] (especially [[Mencius]]) because of the preference of benefit over morals.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com.ar/books?id=nzHmobC0ThsC&amp;dq=a+daoist+theory+of+chinese&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s|title=A Daoist Theory of Chinese Thought: A Philosophical Interpretation|last=Hansen|first=Chad|date=2000-08-17|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=|isbn=9780195350760|location=|pages=158–162|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Thomas Hobbes===
The pure state of nature or "the natural condition of mankind" was described by the 17th century English philosopher [[Thomas Hobbes]], in ''[[Leviathan (Hobbes book)|Leviathan]]'' and in his earlier work ''[[On the Citizen]]''.&lt;ref name="Leviathan"&gt;Hobbes, Thomas, ''Leviathan''. 1651. Edwin Curley (Ed.) 1994. Hackett Publishing.&lt;/ref&gt; Hobbes argued that all humans are by nature equal in faculties of body and mind (i.e., no ''natural'' inequalities are so great as to give anyone a "claim" to an exclusive "benefit"). From this equality and other causes {{Examples|date=June 2018}}in human nature, everyone is naturally willing to fight one another: so that "during the time men live without a common power to keep them all in awe, they are in that condition which is called warre; and such a warre as is of every man against every man". In this state every person has a [[natural right]] or liberty to do anything one thinks necessary for preserving one's own life; and life is "solitary, poor, [[nasty, brutish, and short]]" (''Leviathan,'' Chapters XIII–XIV). Hobbes described this natural condition with the Latin phrase ''[[bellum omnium contra omnes]]'' (meaning war of all against all), in his work ''[[De Cive]]''.

Within the state of nature there is neither personal property nor injustice since there is no law, except for certain natural precepts discovered by reason ("[[Natural law|laws of nature]]"): the first of which is "that every man ought to endeavour peace, as far as he has hope of obtaining it" (''Leviathan'', Ch. XIV); and the second is "that a man be willing, when others are so too, as far forth as for peace and defence of himself he shall think it necessary, to lay down this right to all things; and be contented with so much liberty against other men as he would allow other men against himself" (''loc. cit.''). From here Hobbes develops the way out of the state of nature into political society and government, by [[Social Contract|mutual contracts]].

According to Hobbes the state of nature exists at all times among independent countries, over whom there is no law except for those same precepts or laws of nature (''Leviathan'', Chapters XIII, XXX end). His view of the state of nature helped to serve as a basis for theories of international law and relations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Yurdusev|first1=A. Nuri|title=Thomas Hobbes and international relations: from realism to rationalism|journal=Australian Journal of International Affairs|date=June 2006|volume=60|issue=2|page=305|url=http://www3.dogus.edu.tr/cerdem/images/Political%20Thought/Thomas%20Hobbes%20and%20international%20relations%20from%20realism%20to%20rationalism.pdf|accessdate=2 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== John Locke ===
[[John Locke]] considers the state of nature in his ''[[Second Treatise on Civil Government]]'' written around the time of the [[Exclusion Crisis]] in England during the 1680s. For Locke, in the state of nature all men are free "to order their actions, and dispose of their possessions and persons, as they think fit, within the bounds of the law of nature." (2nd Tr., §4). "The state of Nature has a law of Nature to govern it", and that law is reason. Locke believes that reason teaches that "no one ought to harm another in his life, liberty, and or property" (2nd Tr., §6) ; and that transgressions of this may be punished. Locke describes the state of nature and civil society to be opposites of each other, and the need for civil society comes in part from the perpetual existence of the state of nature.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Goldwin|first1=Robert|title=Locke's State of Nature in Political Society|journal=The Western Political Quarterly|date=March 1976|volume=29|issue=1|page=126|doi=10.2307/447588|jstor=447588}}&lt;/ref&gt; This view of the state of nature is partly deduced from Christian belief (unlike Hobbes, whose philosophy is not dependent upon any prior theology).

Although it may be natural to assume that Locke was responding to Hobbes, Locke never refers to Hobbes by name, and may instead have been responding to other writers of the day, like [[Robert Filmer]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Quentin Skinner|Skinner, Quentin]]. ''Visions of Politics''. Cambridge.&lt;/ref&gt; In fact, Locke's First Treatise is entirely a response to Filmer's ''Patriarcha'', and takes a step by step method to refuting Filmer's theory set out in ''Patriarcha''. The conservative party at the time had rallied behind Filmer's ''Patriarcha'', whereas the Whigs, scared of another prosecution of Anglicans and Protestants, rallied behind the theory set out by Locke in his ''Two Treatises of Government'' as it gave a clear theory as to why the people would be justified in overthrowing a monarchy which abuses the trust they had placed in it.{{citation needed|reason=A causal historical claim that needs to be sourced|date=February 2016}}

=== Montesquieu ===
[[Montesquieu]] makes use of the concept of the state of nature in his ''[[The Spirit of the Laws]]'', first printed in 1748. Montesquieu states the thought process behind early human beings before the formation of society. He says that human beings would have the faculty of knowing and would first think to preserve their life in the state. Human beings would also at first feel themselves to be impotent and weak. As a result, humans would not be likely to attack each other in this state. Next, humans would seek nourishment and out of fear, and impulse would eventually unite to create society. Once society was created, a state of war would ensue amongst societies which would have been all created the same way. The purpose of war is the preservation of the society and the self. The formation of law within society is the reflection and application of reason for Montesquieu.&lt;ref&gt;Translated by Thomas Nugent, revised by J. V. Prichard. Based on edition published in 1914 by G. Bell &amp; Sons, Ltd., London. Rendered into HTML and text by Jon Roland of the Constitution Society, where the full text of this document may be found, Book 2&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Jean-Jacques Rousseau ===
Hobbes' view was challenged in the eighteenth century by [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau]], who claimed that Hobbes was taking socialized people and simply imagining them living outside of the society in which they were raised. He affirmed instead that people were neither good nor bad, but were born as a blank slate, and later society and the environment influence which way we lean. In Rousseau's state of nature, people did not know each other enough to come into serious conflict and they did have normal values. The modern society, and the ownership it entails, is blamed for the disruption of the state of nature which Rousseau sees as true freedom.&lt;ref&gt;Jean-Jacques Rousseau, ''A Discourse on Inequality''&lt;/ref&gt;

=== David Hume ===
[[David Hume]] offers in ''A Treatise of Human Nature'' (1739) that human beings are naturally social: "'Tis utterly impossible for men to remain any considerable time in that savage condition, which precedes society; but that his very first state and situation may justly be esteem'd social. This, however, hinders not, but that philosophers may, if they please, extend their reasoning to the suppos'd state of nature; provided they allow it to be a mere philosophical fiction, which never had, and never cou'd have any reality."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Hume|first1=David|title=A Treatise of Human Nature|date=1739|publisher=Project Gutenberg|pages=Book III, Part II, Section II|url=http://www.gutenberg.org/files/4705/4705-h/4705-h.htm#link2H_4_0089|accessdate=2 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hume's ideas about human nature expressed in the ''Treatise'' suggest that he would be happy with neither Hobbes' nor his contemporary Rousseau's thought-experiments. He explicitly derides as incredible the hypothetical humanity described in Hobbes' ''Leviathan''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Hume|first1=David|title=A Treatise of Human Nature|date=1739|publisher=Project Gutenberg|pages=Book II, Part III, Section I|url=http://www.gutenberg.org/files/4705/4705-h/4705-h.htm#link2H_4_0089|accessdate=2 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Additionally, he argues in "Of the Origin of Justice and Property" that if mankind were universally benevolent, we would not hold Justice to be a virtue: "’tis only from the selfishness and confin’d generosity of men, along with the scanty provision nature has made for his wants, that justice derives its origin."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Hume|first1=David|title=A Treatise of Human Nature|date=1739|publisher=Project Gutenberg|pages=Book III, Part II, Section II|url=http://www.gutenberg.org/files/4705/4705-h/4705-h.htm#link2H_4_0089|accessdate=2 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===John Calhoun===

[[John C. Calhoun]], in his ''Disquisition on Government'', (1850) wrote that a state of nature is merely hypothetical and argues that the concept is self-contradictory and that political states naturally always existed.  "It is, indeed, difficult to explain how an opinion so destitute of all sound reason, ever could have been so extensively entertained, ... I refer to the assertion, that all men are equal in the state of nature; meaning, by a state of nature, a state of individuality, supposed to have existed prior to the social and political state; and in which men lived apart and independent of each other... But such a state is purely hypothetical. It never did, nor can exist; as it is inconsistent with the preservation and perpetuation of the race. It is, therefore, a great misnomer to call it the state of nature. Instead of being the natural state of man, it is, of all conceivable states, the most opposed to his nature—most repugnant to his feelings, and most incompatible with his wants. His natural state is, the social and political—the one for which his Creator made him, and the only one in which he can preserve and perfect his race. As, then, there never was such a state as the, so called, state of nature, and never can be, it follows, that men, instead of being born in it, are born in the social and political state; and of course, instead of being born free and equal, are born subject, not only to parental authority, but to the laws and institutions of the country where born, and under whose protection they draw their first breath."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Calhoun|first1=John|title=Disquisition on Government|url=http://www.constitution.org/jcc/disq_gov.htm|accessdate=2 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Anchor|20th century}}
=== John Rawls ===
[[John Rawls]] used what amounted to an artificial state of nature. To develop his [[A Theory of Justice|theory of justice]], Rawls places everyone in the [[original position]]. The original position is a hypothetical state of nature used as a [[thought experiment]]. People in the original position have no society and are under a [[veil of ignorance (philosophy)|veil of ignorance]] that prevents them from knowing how they may benefit from society. They lack foreknowledge of their intelligence, wealth, or abilities. Rawls reasons that people in the original position would want a society where they had their basic liberties protected and where they had some economic guarantees as well. If society were to be constructed from scratch through a social agreement between individuals, these principles would be the expected basis of such an agreement. Thus, these principles should form the basis of real, modern societies since everyone should consent to them if society were organized from scratch in fair agreements.

=== Robert Nozick ===
Rawls' Harvard colleague [[Robert Nozick]] countered the liberal ''[[A Theory of Justice]]'' with the libertarian ''[[Anarchy, State, and Utopia]]'', also grounded in the state of nature tradition.&lt;ref name="Rothbard"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Rothbard |first=Murray N. |authorlink=Murray Rothbard |title=Robert Nozick and the Immaculate Conception of the State |journal= Journal of Libertarian Studies |volume= 1, Num 1. |pages= 45–47 |year=1977 |url= https://mises.org/journals/jls/1_1/1_1_6.pdf |format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nozick argued that a minimalist state of property rights and basic law enforcement would develop out of a state of nature without violating anyone's rights or using force. Mutual agreements among individuals rather than social contract would lead to this minimal state.

== Between nations ==
In Hobbes' view, once a civil government is instituted, the state of nature has disappeared between individuals because of the civil power which exists to enforce contracts and the laws of nature generally. Between nations, however, no such power exists and therefore nations have the same rights to preserve themselves—including making war—as individuals possessed. Such a conclusion led some writers to the idea of an association of nations or worldwide [[civil society]]. Among them there were [[Immanuel Kant]] with his work on [[perpetual peace]]. This aim was taken up by former US President [[George H W Bush]] in the drive to create a "New World Order" which he describes as "a world where the rule of law, not the law of the jungle, governs the conduct of nations".

Rawls also examines the state of nature between nations. In his work the ''[[Law of Peoples]]'', Rawls applies a modified version of his original position thought experiment to international relationships. Rawls says that peoples, not states, form the basic unit that should be examined. States should be encouraged to follow the principles from Rawls' earlier ''A Theory of Justice''. [[Democracy]] seems like it would be the most logical means of accomplishing these goals, but benign non-democracies should be seen as acceptable at the international stage. Rawls develops eight principles for how a people should act on an international stage.

'''{{lang|la|Status quo}}''' is a [[list of Latin phrases|Latin phrase]] meaning the existing [[state of affairs (sociology)|state of affairs]], particularly with regard to social or political issues.&lt;ref&gt;[[:googledefine:status quo|"Status Quo" - Google Definitions]]&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[Sociology|sociological]] sense, it generally applies to maintain or change existing social structure and values.&lt;ref name=gloss&gt;{{cite web|author1=Dr. C. Michael Botterweck|title=Glossary for Sociology 100|url=http://academics.triton.edu/faculty/mbotterweck/glossary.html|website=academics.triton.edu|accessdate=8 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; With regard to policy debate, the status quo refers to how conditions are at the time and how the affirmative team can solve these conditions for example "The countries are now trying to maintain a status quo with regards to their nuclear arsenal which will help them if the situation gets any worse."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Status quo|url=http://www.theidioms.com/status-quo}}''TheIdioms.com - Online Idioms Dictionary''&lt;/ref&gt;

It is the nominal form of the prepositional [[Latin]] phrase "{{lang|la|in statu quo}}" – literally "in the state in which", which itself is a shortening of the original phrase ''{{lang|la|[[status quo ante bellum|in statu quo res erant ante bellum]]}}'', meaning "in the state in which things were before the war". To maintain the status quo is to keep the things the way they presently are. The related phrase ''{{lang|la|[[status quo ante (disambiguation)|status quo ante]]}}'', literally "the state in which before",&lt;ref name=dict&gt;{{cite web|title=Status Quo Definition|url=http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/status+quo|website=dictionary.reference.com|publisher=Dictionary.com|accessdate=8 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; means "the state of affairs that existed previously".&lt;ref name=dict/&gt;

== Political usage ==

[[social movement|Social movements]] are an example of times when the status quo might be challenged. In these instances ''status quo'' refers to the current state of affairs around a particular issue, or perhaps the current culture or social climate of an entire [[society]] or [[nation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.featherpicking.com/The%20Social%20Climate.htm|title=The Social Climate|accessdate=2009-03-11|work=The Optimal Environment: Part Four|publisher=www.featherpicking.com|last=Clark|first=Pamela|year=2000}}&lt;/ref&gt; The status quo is generally perceived negatively by supporters of the social movement, and people who want to maintain the status quo can be seen as being resistant to progress.&lt;ref name=vocab&gt;{{cite web|title=Status Quo - Dictionary Definition|url=http://www.vocabulary.com/dictionary/status%20quo|website=vocabulary.com|publisher=vocabulary.com|accessdate=8 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Politicians sometimes refer to a status quo. Often there is a policy of deliberate ambiguity, referring to the status quo rather than formalizing the status. [[Clark Kerr]] is reported to have said: "The status quo is the only [[Problem solving|solution]] that cannot be [[veto]]ed".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.co.il/books?id=l-w6CwAAQBAJ&amp;lpg=PA182&amp;ots=eXNtHsw5ex&amp;dq=clark%20kerr%20The%20status%20quo%20is%20the%20only%20solution%20that%20cannot%20be%20vetoe&amp;pg=PA182#v=onepage&amp;q=clark%20kerr%20The%20status%20quo%20is%20the%20only%20solution%20that%20cannot%20be%20vetoe&amp;f=false|title=Momentum: The Responsibility Paradigm and Virtuous Cycles of Change in Colleges and Universities|last=Seymour|first=Daniel|date=2015-12-07|publisher=Rowman &amp; Littlefield|isbn=9781475821048|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8777">In [[mathematics]], '''subadditivity''' is a property of a function that states, roughly, that evaluating the function for the sum of two [[element (set)|elements]] of the [[Domain of a function|domain]] always returns something less than or equal to the sum of the function's values at each element. There are numerous examples of subadditive functions in various areas of mathematics, particularly [[norm (mathematics)|norms]] and [[square roots]]. [[Additive map]]s are special cases of subadditive functions.

==Definitions==
A subadditive function is a [[function (mathematics)|function]] &lt;math&gt;f \colon A \to B&lt;/math&gt;, having a [[Domain of a function|domain]] ''A'' and an [[partial order|ordered]] [[codomain]] ''B'' that are both [[closure (mathematics)|closed]] under addition, with the following property:
::&lt;math&gt;\forall x, y \in A, f(x+y)\leq f(x)+f(y).&lt;/math&gt;

An example is the [[square root]] function, having the [[non-negative]] [[real number]]s as domain and codomain,
since &lt;math&gt;\forall x, y \geq 0&lt;/math&gt; we have:
::&lt;math&gt;\sqrt{x+y}\leq \sqrt{x}+\sqrt{y}.&lt;/math&gt;

A [[sequence]] &lt;math&gt;\left \{ a_n \right \}, n \geq 1&lt;/math&gt;, is called '''subadditive''' if it satisfies the [[inequality (mathematics)|inequality]]
::&lt;math&gt;(1) \qquad a_{n+m}\leq a_n+a_m&lt;/math&gt;
for all ''m'' and ''n''. This is a special case of subadditive function, if a sequence is interpreted as a function on the set of natural numbers.

==Properties==

===Sequences===
A useful result pertaining to subadditive sequences is the following [[lemma (mathematics)|lemma]] due to [[Michael Fekete]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Fekete |first=M. |title=Über die Verteilung der Wurzeln bei gewissen algebraischen Gleichungen mit ganzzahligen Koeffizienten |journal=Mathematische Zeitschrift |volume=17 |issue=1 |year=1923 |pages=228–249 |doi=10.1007/BF01504345 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

:'''Fekete's Subadditive Lemma:'''  For every subadditive sequence &lt;math&gt;{\left \{ a_n \right \}}_{n=1}^\infty&lt;/math&gt;, the [[Limit of a sequence|limit]] &lt;math&gt;\displaystyle \lim_{n \to \infty} \frac{a_n}{n}&lt;/math&gt; exists and is equal to &lt;math&gt;\inf \frac{a_n}{n}&lt;/math&gt;.  (The limit may be &lt;math&gt;-\infty&lt;/math&gt;.)

The analogue of Fekete's lemma holds for superadditive sequences as well, that is:
&lt;math&gt;a_{n+m}\geq a_n + a_m.&lt;/math&gt;  (The limit then may be positive infinity: consider the sequence &lt;math&gt;a_n = \log n!&lt;/math&gt;.)

There are extensions of Fekete's lemma that do not require the inequality (1) to hold for all ''m'' and ''n'', but only for ''m'' and ''n'' such that &lt;math&gt;\frac12\le\frac m n\le2.&lt;/math&gt; Moreover, the condition &lt;math&gt;a_{n+m}\le a_n + a_m&lt;/math&gt; may be weakened as follows: &lt;math&gt;a_{n+m}\le a_n + a_m + \phi(n+m)&lt;/math&gt; provided that &lt;math&gt;\phi&lt;/math&gt; is an increasing function such that the integral &lt;math&gt;\int \phi(t) t^{-2} \, dt&lt;/math&gt; converges (near the infinity).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=de Bruijn |first1=N.G. |last2=Erdös |first2=P. |title=Some linear and some quadratic recursion formulas. II |journal=Nederl. Akad. Wetensch. Proc. Ser. A |volume=55 |year=1952 |pages=152–163}} (The same as ''Indagationes Math.'' '''14'''.) See also Steele 1997, Theorem 1.9.2.&lt;/ref&gt;

There are also results that allow one to deduce the rate of convergence to the limit whose existence is stated in Fekete's lemma if some kind of both [[superadditive|superadditivity]] and subadditivity is present.&lt;ref&gt;Michael J. Steele. "Probability theory and combinatorial optimization". SIAM, Philadelphia (1997). {{isbn|0-89871-380-3}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video|author=Michael J. Steele|title=CBMS Lectures on Probability Theory and Combinatorial Optimization|publisher=University of Cambridge|year=2011|url=http://sms.cam.ac.uk/collection/1189351}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Besides, analogues of Fekete's lemma have been proved for subadditive real maps (with additional assumptions) from finite subsets of an amenable group &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| doi = 10.1007/BF02810577| issn = 0021-2172| volume = 115| issue = 1| pages = 1–24| last1 = Lindenstrauss| first1 = Elon| last2 = Weiss| first2 = Benjamin| title = Mean topological dimension| journal = Israel Journal of Mathematics| year = 2000| citeseerx = 10.1.1.30.3552}} Theorem 6.1&lt;/ref&gt;

and further, of a cancellative left-amenable semigroup.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | arxiv = 1209.6179| last1 = Ceccherini-Silberstein| first1 = Tullio| title = An analogue of Fekete's lemma for subadditive functions on cancellative amenable semigroups| journal = J. Anal. Math.| volume = 124| pages = 59–81| last2 = Krieger| first2 = Fabrice| last3 = Coornaert| first3 = Michel| year = 2014}} Theorem 1.1&lt;/ref&gt;

===Functions===
:'''Theorem:'''&lt;ref&gt;Hille 1948, Theorem 6.6.1. (Measurability is stipulated in Sect. 6.2 "Preliminaries".)&lt;/ref&gt; For every [[Measurable function|measurable]] subadditive function &lt;math&gt;f:(0,\infty)\to\mathbb R,&lt;/math&gt; the limit &lt;math&gt;\lim_{t\to\infty} \frac{f(t)}{t}&lt;/math&gt; exists and is equal to &lt;math&gt;\inf_{t&gt;0} \frac{f(t)}{t}.&lt;/math&gt; (The limit may be &lt;math&gt;-\infty.&lt;/math&gt;)

If ''f'' is a subadditive function, and if 0 is in its domain, then ''f''(0) ≥ 0. To see this, take the inequality at the top. &lt;math&gt;f(x) \ge f(x+y) - f(y)&lt;/math&gt;. Hence &lt;math&gt;f(0) \ge f(0+y) - f(y) = 0&lt;/math&gt;

A [[concave function]] &lt;math&gt;f: [0,\infty) \to [0,\infty)&lt;/math&gt; with &lt;math&gt;f(0) \ge 0&lt;/math&gt; is also subadditive.
To see this, one first observes that &lt;math&gt;f(x) \ge \textstyle{\frac{y}{x+y}} f(0) + \textstyle{\frac{x}{x+y}} f(x+y)&lt;/math&gt;.
Then looking at the sum of this bound for &lt;math&gt;f(x)&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;f(y)&lt;/math&gt;, will finally verify that ''f'' is subadditive.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Schechter | first=Eric | authorlink=Eric Schechter| title=Handbook of Analysis and its Foundations | publisher=Academic Press | location = San Diego | year=1997 | isbn=978-0-12-622760-4}}, p.314,12.25&lt;/ref&gt;

The negative of a subadditive function is [[superadditivity|superadditive]].

==Examples in various domains==

===Economics===

Subadditivity is an essential property of some particular [[Cost curve|cost function]]s. It is, generally, a [[necessary and sufficient condition]] for the verification of a [[natural monopoly]]. It implies that production from only one firm is socially less expensive (in terms of average costs) than production of a fraction of the original quantity by an equal number of firms.

[[Economies of scale]] are represented by subadditive [[average cost]] functions.

Except in the case of complementary goods, the price of goods (as a function of quantity) must be subadditive. Otherwise, if the sum of the cost of two items is cheaper than the cost of the bundle of two of them together, then nobody would ever buy the bundle, effectively causing the price of the bundle to "become" the sum of the prices of the two separate items.  Thus proving that it is not a sufficient condition for a natural monopoly; since the unit of exchange may not be the actual cost of an item.  This situation is familiar to everyone in the political arena where some minority asserts that the loss of some particular freedom at some particular level of government means that many governments are better; whereas the majority assert that there is some other correct unit of cost.{{citation needed|date=October 2015}}

===Thermodynamics===
Subadditivity occurs in the thermodynamic properties of non-[[ideal solution]]s and mixtures like the excess molar volume and [[heat of mixing]] or excess enthalpy.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2258">A '''traffic model''' is a [[mathematical model]] of real-world [[traffic]], usually, but not restricted to, [[road traffic]]. Traffic modeling draws heavily on theoretical foundations like [[network theory]] and certain theories from physics like the [[kinematic wave]] model. The interesting quantity being modeled and measured is the [[traffic flow]], i.e. the throughput of mobile units (e.g. [[vehicle]]s) per time and transportation medium capacity (e.g. road or lane width). Models can teach researchers and engineers how to ensure an optimal flow with a minimum number of [[traffic jam]]s.

Traffic models often are the basis of a [[traffic simulation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Mahmud|first1=Khizir|last2=Town|first2=Graham E.|title=A review of computer tools for modeling electric vehicle energy requirements and their impact on power distribution networks|journal=Applied Energy|date=June 2016|volume=172|pages=337–359|doi=10.1016/j.apenergy.2016.03.100}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Types==
;[[Microscopic traffic flow model]]: Traffic flow is assumed to depend on individual mobile units, i.e. cars, which are explicitly modeled

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8169">In genetics, transgressive segregation is the formation of extreme phenotypes, or transgressive phenotypes, observed in segregated [[Hybrid (biology)|hybrid]] populations compared to phenotypes observed in the parental lines.&lt;ref&gt;Nolte, Arne W.; H David Sheets (2005-06-29). "Shape based assignment tests suggest transgressive phenotypes in natural sculpin hybrids (Teleostei, Scorpaeniformes, Cottidae)". Frontiers in Zoology&lt;/ref&gt; The appearance of these trangressive (extreme) phenotypes can be either positive or negative in terms of [[Fitness (biology)|fitness]]. If both parents' favorable alleles come together, it will result in a hybrid having a higher fitness than the two parents. The hybrid species will show more genetic variation and variation in gene expression than their parents. As a result, the hybrid species will have some traits that are transgressive (extreme) in nature. Transgressive segregation can allow a hybrid species to populate different environments/niches in which the parent species do not reside, or compete in the existing environment with the parental species.

==Causes==

'''Genetic'''

There are many causes for transgressive segregation in hybrids. One cause can be due to recombination of additive alleles. [[Genetic recombination|Recombination]] results in new pairs of alleles at two or more loci. These different pairs of alleles can give rise to new phenotypes if gene expression has been changed at these loci. Another cause can be elevated [[mutation rate]]. When mutation rates are high, it is more probable that a mutation will occur and cause an extreme phenotypic change. Reduced [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9375532 developmental stability] is another cause for transgressive segregation. Developmental stability refers to the capability of a genotype to go through a constant development of a phenotype in a certain environmental setting. If there is a disturbance due to genetic or environmental factors, the genotype will be more sensitive to phenotypic changes. Another cause arises from the interaction between two alleles of two different genes, also known as the [[Epistasis|epistatic effect]]. Epistasis is the event when one allele at a locus prevents an allele at another locus to express its product as if it is masking its effect. Therefore, epistasis can be related to gene over dominance caused by heterozygosity at specific loci.[2] What this means is that the heterozygote (hybrid) when compared to the homozygote (parent) is better adapted and therefore shows more transgressive, extreme phenotypes. All of these causes lead to the appearance of these extreme phenotypes and creates a hybrid species that will deviate away from the parent species niche and eventually create an individual "hybrid" species.

'''Environmental'''
 
Other than the genetic factors solely causing transgressive segregation, environmental factors can cause genetic factors to take place. Environmental factors that cause transgressive segregation can be influenced by human activity and [[climate change]]. Both human activity and climate change have the capability to force species of a specific [[genome]] to interact with other species with different genomes.

For example, if a bridge is built that connects two isolated areas to one another, a [[gene flow]] door would open. This open door will increase the interactions between different species with different genomes can create hybrid species that can potentially show transgressive phenotypes. Human activity can open the gene flow door by pursuing harmful actions such as cutting down forests and pollution. Climate change on the other hand can open the gene flow door by breaking climate and environmental barriers that were present before. This convergence between species can give rise to a hybrid species that will have more phenotypic variation when compared to the parent species. This increase in phenotypic variation has the potential for transgressive segregation to occur.&lt;ref&gt;Hegarty, M. J. "Invasion of the hybrids." Molecular Ecology 21.19 (2012): 4669–4671.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Examples of transgressive segregation==

In Kenya, there is an organism called [[Mycosphaerella graminicola|septoria tritici blotch]] (STB) that diminishes yield in wheat crop. The parent species of wheat had little resistance toward STB, but the hybrid species due to transgressive segregation showed a higher resistance toward STB and therefore a higher fitness. You can create a higher resistance to STB by crossing genes together that are efficient. In result, out of 36 crosses there were 31 that showed a higher mean fitness than the control, parent value. These 31 crosses indicate a higher resistance to STB. The crosses used were from other commercial wheat's that were high yielding which is advantageous because there is a lower chance of deleterious (unwanted traits) appearing and therefore an increase in beneficial traits. Transgressive segregation has been found to be useful to create a resistance toward this organism in order to increase the yield of wheat crop.&lt;ref&gt;Arama, P. F., J. E. Parlevliet, and C. H. Van Silfhout. "Trangressive segregation for resistance in wheat to sep toria tritici blotch." African Crop Science Journal8.3 (2000): 213–222.&lt;/ref&gt;

Rieseberg used sunflowers to show the transgressive segregation of parental traits. ''[[Sunflower|Helianthus annuus]]'' and ''[[Helianthus petiolaris]]'' are the two parent groups for the hybrids. Ultimately there were three hybrid sunflower species. When compared to the fitness of the parents, the hybrids showed a higher tolerance in areas which the parent species would not be able to survive i.e. salt marsh, sand dunes, and deserts. Transgressive segregation allowed these hybrids to survive in areas that the parent would not be able to. Therefore, the hybrids were populated in areas where the parent species were not. This is due to hybrid species showing more [[gene expression]] (phenotypes) than their parents and also having some genes that are transgressive (extreme) in nature.&lt;ref&gt;Schwarzbach, Andrea E., Lisa A. Donovan, and Loren H. Rieseberg. "Transgressive character expression in a hybrid sunflower species." American Journal of Botany 88.2 (2001): 270–277.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Testing for transgressive segregation==

There are many ways to test if transgressive segregation occurred within a population. One common way to test for transgressive segregation is to use a [[Dunnett's test]]. This test looks at whether the hybrid species' performance was different from the control group by looking whether or not the mean of the control group (parent species) differs significantly from mean of the other groups. If there is a difference, that is an indication of transgressive segregation.&lt;ref&gt;Johansen‐Morris, A. D., and R. G. Latta. "Fitness consequences of hybridization between ecotypes of Avena barbata: hybrid breakdown, hybrid vigor, and transgressive segregation." Evolution 60.8 (2006): 1585–1595.&lt;/ref&gt; Another commonly used test is the use of [[Quantitative trait locus|quantitative trait loci (QTL)]] to assess transgressive segregation. Alleles with QTL that were opposed (either by overdomiance or underdominance) of the parental parent QTL indicate that transgressive segregation occurred. Alleles with QTL that was the same as the predicted parent QTL showed that there was no transgressive segregation.&lt;ref&gt;Tanksley, S. D. "QTL analysis of transgressive segregation in an interspecific tomato cross." Genetics 134.2 (1993): 585–596. (p.589)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Importance==

Transgressive segregation creates an opportunity for new hybrid species to arise that are more fit than their ancestors. As seen with the STB in Kenya and Rieseberg's sunflowers, transgressive segregation can be used to create a species that is more adaptable and resistant in areas where there is environmental stress. Transgressive segregation can be seen as [[genetic engineering]] in the way that the goal for each of these events is to create an organism that is more fit than the last.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10583">In [[mathematics]], the '''uniform boundedness principle''' or '''Banach–Steinhaus theorem''' is one of the fundamental results in [[functional analysis]]. Together with the [[Hahn–Banach theorem]] and the [[open mapping theorem (functional analysis)|open mapping theorem]], it is considered one of the cornerstones of the field.  In its basic form, it asserts that for a family of [[continuous linear operator]]s (and thus bounded operators) whose domain is a [[Banach space]], pointwise boundedness is equivalent to uniform boundedness in operator norm.

The theorem was first published in 1927 by [[Stefan Banach]] and [[Hugo Steinhaus]] but it was also proven independently by [[Hans Hahn (mathematician)|Hans Hahn]].

==Theorem==
'''Theorem (Uniform Boundedness Principle).''' Let ''X''  and ''Y'' be [[Banach space]]s. Suppose that ''F'' is a collection of continuous linear operators from ''X'' to ''Y''. If for all ''x'' in ''X'' one has

:&lt;math&gt;\sup\nolimits_{T \in F} \|T(x)\|_Y  &lt; \infty, &lt;/math&gt;

then

:&lt;math&gt;\sup\nolimits_{T \in F,\|x\|=1} \|T(x)\|_Y=\sup\nolimits_{T \in F} \|T\|_{B(X,Y)}  &lt; \infty.&lt;/math&gt;

==Proof==
The completeness of ''X'' enables the following short proof, using the [[Baire category theorem]].

'''Proof.''' Suppose that for every ''x'' in the Banach space ''X'', one has:

:&lt;math&gt;\sup\nolimits_{T \in F} \|T (x)\|_Y  &lt; \infty.&lt;/math&gt;

For every integer &lt;math&gt;n \in \mathbb{N}&lt;/math&gt;, let

:&lt;math&gt; X_n = \left  \{x \in X \ : \ \sup\nolimits_{T \in F} \|T (x)\|_Y \le n \right \}. &lt;/math&gt;

The set &lt;math&gt;X_n&lt;/math&gt; is a [[closed set]] and by the assumption,

:&lt;math&gt;\bigcup\nolimits_{n \in \mathbf{N}} X_n = X \neq \varnothing.&lt;/math&gt;

By the [[Baire category theorem]] for the non-empty [[complete metric space]]&amp;nbsp;''X'', there exists ''m'' such that 
&lt;math&gt; X_m&lt;/math&gt; has non-empty [[Interior (topology)|interior]], ''i.e.'', there exist &lt;math&gt;x_0 \in X_m&lt;/math&gt; and {{nowrap|ε &amp;gt; 0}} such that

:&lt;math&gt; \overline{B_\varepsilon (x_0)} := \{x \in X \,:\, \|x - x_0\| \le \varepsilon \} \subseteq  X_m.&lt;/math&gt;

Let ''u'' ∈ ''X'' with {{nowrap|ǁ''u''ǁ &amp;le; 1}} and {{nowrap|''T'' ∈ ''F''}}.  One has that:

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
\|T(u) \|_Y &amp;= \varepsilon^{-1} \left \|T \left( x_0 + \varepsilon u \right) - T(x_0) \right \|_Y    &amp; [\text{by linearity of } T ] \\
&amp;\leq \varepsilon^{-1} \left ( \left\| T (x_0 + \varepsilon u) \right\|_Y + \left\| T (x_0) \right\|_Y \right ) \\
&amp;\leq \varepsilon^{-1} (m + m).   &amp; [ \text{since} \ x_0 + \varepsilon u, \ x_0 \in X_m ] \\
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

Taking the supremum over ''u'' in the unit ball of&amp;nbsp;''X'' and over &lt;math&gt;T\in F&lt;/math&gt;, it follows that

:&lt;math&gt; \sup\nolimits_{T \in F} \|T\|_{B(X,Y)}  \leq 2 \varepsilon^{-1} m &lt; \infty.&lt;/math&gt;

There are also simple proofs not using the Baire theorem {{harv|Sokal|2011}}.

==Corollaries==
'''Corollary.''' If a sequence of bounded operators (''T&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;'') converges pointwise, that is, the limit of {''T&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;''(''x'')} exists for all ''x'' in ''X'', then these pointwise limits define a bounded operator ''T''.

Note it is not claimed above that ''T&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;'' converges to ''T'' in operator norm, i.e. uniformly on bounded sets. (However, since {''T&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;''} is bounded in operator norm, and the limit operator ''T'' is continuous, a standard [[3-epsilon estimate|"3-ε" estimate]] shows that ''T&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;'' converges to ''T'' uniformly on ''compact'' sets.)

'''Corollary.''' Any weakly bounded subset S in a normed space Y is bounded.''

Indeed, the elements of ''S'' define a pointwise bounded family of continuous linear forms on the Banach space ''X''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''Y*'', continuous dual of ''Y''.  By the uniform boundedness principle, the norms of elements of ''S'', as functionals on ''X'', that is, norms in the second dual ''Y**'', are bounded.  But for every ''s'' in ''S'', the norm in the second dual coincides with the norm in ''Y'', by a consequence of the [[Hahn–Banach theorem]].

Let ''L''(''X'',&amp;nbsp;''Y'') denote the continuous operators from ''X'' to ''Y'', with the operator norm. If the collection ''F'' is unbounded in ''L''(''X'',&amp;nbsp;''Y''), then by the uniform boundedness principle, we have:

:&lt;math&gt; R = \left \{ x \in X  \ : \ \sup\nolimits_{T \in F} \|Tx\|_Y = \infty \right \} \neq \varnothing&lt;/math&gt;

In fact, ''R'' is dense in ''X''. The complement of ''R'' in ''X'' is the countable union of closed sets &amp;cup;''X&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;''. By the argument used in proving the theorem, each ''X&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;'' is [[nowhere dense]], i.e. the subset &amp;cup;''X&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;'' is ''of first category''. Therefore ''R'' is the complement of a subset of first category in a  Baire space. By definition of a Baire space, such sets (called ''residual sets'') are dense. Such reasoning leads to the '''principle of condensation of singularities''', which can be formulated as follows:

'''Theorem.''' Let ''X'' be a Banach space, {''Y&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;''} a sequence of normed vector spaces, and ''F&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;'' a unbounded family in ''L''(''X'', ''Y&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;''). Then the set

:&lt;math&gt; R = \left \{ x \in X \ : \ \forall n \in \mathbf{N} : \sup\nolimits_{T \in F_n} \|Tx\|_{Y_n} = \infty \right \}&lt;/math&gt;

is of second category, and thus dense in ''X''.

'''Proof.''' The complement of ''R'' is the countable union

:&lt;math&gt;\bigcup\nolimits_{n,m} \left \{ x \in X \ : \ \sup\nolimits_{T \in F_n} \|Tx\|_{Y_n} \le m \right \}&lt;/math&gt;

of sets of first category. Therefore its residual set ''R'' is dense.

==Example: pointwise convergence of Fourier series==
Let &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{T}&lt;/math&gt; be the [[circle group|circle]], and let &lt;math&gt;C(\mathbb{T})&lt;/math&gt; be the Banach space of continuous functions on &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{T}&lt;/math&gt;, with the [[uniform norm]]. Using the uniform boundedness principle, one can show that there exists an element in &lt;math&gt;C(\mathbb{T})&lt;/math&gt; for which the Fourier series does not converge pointwise.

For &lt;math&gt;f \in C(\mathbb{T})&lt;/math&gt;, its [[Fourier series]] is defined by

:&lt;math&gt;\sum_{k \in \mathbf{Z}} \hat{f}(k) e^{ikx} = \sum_{k \in \mathbf{Z}}\frac{1}{2\pi} \left (\int_0 ^{2 \pi} f(t) e^{-ikt} dt \right) e^{ikx},&lt;/math&gt;

and the ''N''-th symmetric partial sum is

:&lt;math&gt; S_N(f)(x) = \sum_{k=-N}^N \hat{f}(k) e^{ikx} =  \frac{1}{2 \pi} \int_0 ^{2 \pi} f(t) D_N(x - t) \, dt,&lt;/math&gt;

where ''D&lt;sub&gt;N&lt;/sub&gt;'' is the ''N''-th [[Dirichlet kernel]]. Fix &lt;math&gt;x \in \mathbb{T}&lt;/math&gt; and consider the convergence of {''S&lt;sub&gt;N&lt;/sub&gt;''(''f'')(''x'')}.  The functional φ&lt;sub&gt;''N,x''&lt;/sub&gt; : &lt;math&gt;C(\mathbb{T})\rightarrow \mathbb{C}&lt;/math&gt; defined by

:&lt;math&gt;\varphi_{N, x} (f) =  S_N(f)(x), \qquad f \in C(\mathbb{T}),&lt;/math&gt;

is bounded.  The norm of φ&lt;sub&gt;''N,x''&lt;/sub&gt;, in the dual of &lt;math&gt;C(\mathbb{T})&lt;/math&gt;, is the norm of the signed measure (2π)&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;''D''&lt;sub&gt;''N''&lt;/sub&gt;(''x''−''t'')&amp;nbsp;d''t'', namely

:&lt;math&gt; \left \| \varphi_{N,x} \right \| =  \frac{1}{2 \pi} \int_0 ^{2 \pi} \left | D_N(x-t) \right  | \, dt =  \frac{1}{2 \pi} \int_0 ^{2 \pi} \left | D_N(s) \right  | \, ds = \left \|  D_N \right \|_{L^1(\mathbb{T})}.&lt;/math&gt;

One can verify that

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{1}{2 \pi} \int_0 ^{2 \pi} | D_N(t) | \, dt \ge \frac{1}{2\pi}\int_0^{2\pi} \frac{\left |\sin\left ( (N+\tfrac{1}{2})t \right )\right|}{t/2} \, dt \to \infty.&lt;/math&gt;

So the collection {φ&lt;sub&gt;''N,x''&lt;/sub&gt;} is unbounded in &lt;math&gt;C(\mathbb{T})^\ast&lt;/math&gt;, the dual of &lt;math&gt;C(\mathbb{T})&lt;/math&gt;. Therefore by the uniform boundedness principle, for any &lt;math&gt;x \in \mathbb{T}&lt;/math&gt;, the set of continuous functions whose Fourier series diverges at ''x'' is dense in &lt;math&gt;C(\mathbb{T})&lt;/math&gt;.

More can be concluded by applying the principle of condensation of singularities. Let {''x&lt;sub&gt;m&lt;/sub&gt;''} be a dense sequence in &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{T}&lt;/math&gt;. Define φ&lt;sub&gt;''N,x&lt;sub&gt;m&lt;/sub&gt;''&lt;/sub&gt; in the similar way as above. The principle of condensation of singularities then says that the set of continuous functions whose Fourier series diverges at each ''x&lt;sub&gt;m&lt;/sub&gt;'' is dense in &lt;math&gt;C(\mathbb{T})&lt;/math&gt; (however, the Fourier series of a continuous function ''f'' converges to ''f''(''x'') for almost every &lt;math&gt;x \in \mathbb{T}&lt;/math&gt;, by [[Carleson's theorem]]).

== Generalisations ==
The least restrictive setting for the uniform boundedness principle is a [[barrelled space]] where the following generalised version of the theorem holds {{harv|Bourbaki|1987|loc=Theorem III.2.1}}:

'''Theorem.''' Given a barrelled space ''X'' and a [[locally convex space]] ''Y'', then any family of pointwise bounded [[continuous linear mapping]]s from ''X'' to ''Y'' is [[equicontinuous]] (even [[uniformly equicontinuous]]).

Alternatively, the statement also holds whenever ''X'' is a [[Baire space]] and ''Y'' is a locally convex space {{harv|Shtern|2001}}.

{{harvtxt|Dieudonné|1970}} proves a weaker form of this theorem with [[Fréchet space]]s rather than the usual Banach spaces.  Specifically,

'''Theorem.''' Let ''X'' be a Fréchet space, ''Y'' a normed space, and ''H'' a set of continuous linear mappings of ''X'' into ''Y''.  If for every ''x'' in ''X''
:&lt;math&gt;\sup\nolimits_{u\in H}\|u(x)\|&lt;\infty,&lt;/math&gt; 
then the family ''H'' is equicontinuous.

In [[mathematics]], '''vague sets''' are an extension of [[fuzzy set]]s. 

In a fuzzy set, each object is assigned a single [[Value (mathematics)|value]] in the [[Interval (mathematics)|interval]] [0,1] reflecting its ''grade of [[Element (mathematics)|membership]]''. This [[Single-valued function|single value]] does not allow a separation of [[Mathematical proof|evidence]] for membership and evidence against membership. 

Gau et al.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/login.jsp?tp=&amp;arnumber=229476&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fieeexplore.ieee.org%2Fxpls%2Fabs_all.jsp%3Farnumber%3D229476 "Vague sets"].&lt;/ref&gt; proposed the notion of vague sets, where each object is characterized by two different membership [[Function (mathematics)|functions]]: a true membership function and a false membership function.
This kind of reasoning is also called interval membership, as opposed to point membership in the context of fuzzy sets.

==Mathematical definition==
A vague set &lt;math&gt;V&lt;/math&gt; is characterized by
* its true membership function &lt;math&gt;t_v(x)&lt;/math&gt;
* its false membership function &lt;math&gt;f_v(x)&lt;/math&gt;
* with &lt;math&gt;0 \le t_v(x)+f_v(x) \le 1&lt;/math&gt;

The ''grade of membership'' for x is not a crisp value anymore, but can be located in &lt;math&gt;[t_v(x), 1-f_v(x)]&lt;/math&gt;. This interval can be interpreted as an extension to the fuzzy membership function. The vague set degrades to a fuzzy set, if &lt;math&gt;1-f_v(x)=t_v(x)&lt;/math&gt; for all x.
The ''uncertainty'' of x is the difference between the upper and lower bounds of the membership interval; it can be computed as &lt;math&gt;(1-f_v(x))-t_v(x)&lt;/math&gt;.

The '''''Weltalter''''' (sometimes '''''Die Weltalter'''''; "{{bracket|The}} Ages of the World") of [[Friedrich Schelling]] refers to a philosophical work of 1811, and its continuation in manuscript for many years after that. It was a long and unfinished project, sometimes identified with Schelling's  philosophical output from 1809 to 1827, the period beginning with his ''[[Freiheitsschrift]]''.&lt;ref name="SEP"&gt;{{cite SEP |url-id=Schelling |title=Friedrich Wilhelm Joseph von Schelling |last=Bowie  |first=Andrew|date=19 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The ''Weltalter'' fragments==
Despite Schelling's years of work on the project, no definitive version of the ''Weltalter'' emerged. There were three drafts in a series: the later versions were not complete and are often referred to as fragments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Alistair Welchman|title=The New Schelling|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Cj9LsLVpTrEC&amp;pg=RA1-PA18|accessdate=19 July 2012|date=2004|publisher=Continuum International Publishing Group|isbn=978-0-8264-6942-7|page=18}}&lt;/ref&gt; A work ''System der Weltalter'' from 1827/8 consists of Munich lecture notes taken by [[Ernst von Lasaulx]] from Schelling,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Friedrich Wilhelm Joseph Schelling|title=System der Weltalter: Münchener Vorlesung 1827/28 in einer Nachschrift von Ernst von Lasaulx|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=KFDu9GzwrtIC&amp;pg=PR30|accessdate=19 July 2012|year=1998|publisher=Vittorio Klostermann|isbn=978-3-465-02744-7|page=30}}&lt;/ref&gt; who was at that time a student also of [[Franz von Baader]] and [[Joseph Görres]].&lt;ref&gt;[[:de:s:ADB:Lasaulx, Ernst von]]&lt;/ref&gt;

The manuscripts, which no longer exist, are assigned to the periods 1811, 1813 and 1814/5. The 1814/5 manuscript was published posthumously; copies of the other two manuscripts, made by [[Manfred Schröter]] before the destruction of the originals by bombing in [[World War II]], were published in 1946, with some of Schelling's project notes.&lt;ref name="Vassányi2010"&gt;{{cite book|author=Miklós Vassányi|title=Anima Mundi: The Rise of the World Soul Theory in Modern German Philosophy|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ZtfOVk5zz1YC&amp;pg=PA387|accessdate=19 July 2012|date=3 December 2010|publisher=Springer|isbn=978-90-481-8795-9|page=387}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Influences==
Schelling works in the ''Weltalter'' with and from a theological idea of creation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=John Laughland|title=Schelling Versus Hegel: From German Idealism to Christian Metaphysics|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=mOzHYeFPNckC&amp;pg=PA102|accessdate=19 July 2012|year=2007|publisher=Ashgate Publishing, Ltd.|isbn=978-0-7546-6118-4|page=102}}&lt;/ref&gt; He is influenced by the formulations of [[Jakob Boehme]], and in general the Bible.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Joris Geldhof|title=Revelation, Reason and Reality: Theological Encounters With Jaspers, Schelling and Baader|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=PS2to13BblAC&amp;pg=PA96|accessdate=19 July 2012|year=2007|publisher=Peeters Publishers|isbn=978-90-429-1929-7|pages=96–7}}&lt;/ref&gt; Taken as a Romantic theory of the ''[[anima mundi]]'', the ''Weltalter'' writings call on, at least superficially, [[mysticism]] (both Jewish and Christian) and [[natural philosophy]].&lt;ref name="Vassányi2010"/&gt;

==Philosophical formulation==
Aside from the language used, there are a number of formulations explaining the problems Schelling was tackling in the ''Weltalter'' project. According to a 2010 paper,

&lt;blockquote&gt;When Schelling sat down to write the ''Ages of the World'' he had a large number of seemingly contradictory philosophical commitments to reconcile. He wanted to avoid dualism and yet acknowledge the essential and irreducible roles of both spirit and matter. He wanted to give a law-like description of the creation of the world and yet preserve divine freedom. He wanted to treat God as perfect and self-sufficient and yet also account for the motive underlying God's decision to create the world. Perhaps most paradoxically of all, he wanted to explain what events led up to the creation of the past – what ‘caused’ time.&lt;ref&gt;[https://utsa.academia.edu/AlistairWelchman/Papers/193611/Creating_the_Past_Schellings_Ages_of_the_World Alistair Welchman, Judith Norman, ''Creating the Past: Schelling's Ages of the World'']&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The 1813 draft has been called the origin of [[dialectical materialism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Kelsey Wood|title=Zizek: A Reader's Guide|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7HRBODii6dcC&amp;pg=PA119|accessdate=19 July 2012|date=2012|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|isbn=978-1-118-26982-4|page=119}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Slavoj Žižek]] in explaining his attitude to the ''Weltalter'' and its theosophical leanings, however, states that "there is no way of throwing out the dirty bath water without losing the baby".&lt;ref name="Žižek1996"&gt;{{cite book|author=Slavoj Žižek|title=The Indivisible Remainder: An Essay on Schelling and Related Matters|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=K77t2XTpSeMC&amp;pg=PA7|accessdate=19 July 2012|year=1996|publisher=Verso|isbn=978-1-85984-959-0|page=7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10598">'''Wonderland''' is an integrated [[mathematical model]] used for studying phenomena in [[sustainable development]]. First introduced by 
([[#san94|Sanderson 1994]]), there are now several related versions of the model in use.  Wonderland allows [[economists]], [[policy analysts]] and [[environmentalist]] to study the interactions
between the [[economic]], [[demographic]] and [[human impact on the environment|anthropogenic]] sectors of an idealized world, thereby enabling them to obtain insights transferable to the real world.

== Introduction ==

'''Wonderland''' is a compact model.
In total, there are only four continuous state variables, one each for the economic and demographic sectors and two for the anthropogenic sector; thus making Wonderland more compact and amenable to analysis than larger, more intricate models like [[World3]].  For this reason it is often used as an initial testing ground for new techniques in the area of policy analysis ([[#lpb03|Lempert, et al., 2003]]).

== Governing equations ==

Denote the four state variables as: &lt;math&gt;x(t)&lt;/math&gt;&amp;nbsp;– population, &lt;math&gt;y(t)&lt;/math&gt;&amp;nbsp;– per capita output, &lt;math&gt;z(t)&lt;/math&gt;&amp;nbsp;– stock of natural capital and &lt;math&gt;p(t)&lt;/math&gt;&amp;nbsp;– pollution flow per unit of output. Let &lt;math&gt;x,y\in[0,\infty)&lt;/math&gt; and
&lt;math&gt;z,p\in[0,1]&lt;/math&gt;, then the state variables evolve in [[discrete time]], according to the following [[recurrence relation]]s ([[#san94|Sanderson, 1994]]).
: &lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
x(t+1) &amp;= x(t)\left[1+b\Big(y(t),z(t)\Big) - d\Big(y(t),z(t)\Big)\right],\\
y(t+1) &amp;=y(t)\left(1+\gamma-(\gamma+\eta)\Big[1-z(t)\Big]^{\lambda}\right),\\
z(t+1) &amp;= \frac{g\Big(x(t),y(t),z(t),p(t)\Big)}{1+g\Big(x(t),y(t),z(t),p(t)\Big)},\\
p(t+1) &amp;= p(t)(1-\chi),\\
\ &amp;\ \\
\!\!\!\text{where,} \qquad &amp;\ \\
\ &amp;\ \\
b(y,z)&amp;= \beta_0\left[\beta_1 - \left(\frac{e^{\beta y}}{1+e^{\beta y}}\right)\right],\\
d(y,z)&amp;= \alpha_0\left[\alpha_1 - \left(\frac{e^{\alpha y}}{1+e^{\alpha y}}\right)\right]
         \left[1+\alpha_2(1-z)^{\theta}\right],\\
g(x,y,z,p)&amp;= \frac{z}{1-z}\,e^{\,\delta z^{\rho}-\omega f(x,y,p)}, \ \text{and}\\
f(x,y,p)&amp;=xyp.
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

Altogether, these equations depend upon 15 parameters.

{| class="wikitable"
|-
! Sector !! Parameter
|-
| Economic || &lt;math&gt;\ \gamma, \ \eta, \ \lambda&lt;/math&gt;
|-
| Demographic || &lt;math&gt;\ \chi, \ \delta, \ \rho, \ \omega&lt;/math&gt;
|-
| Anthropogenic || &lt;math&gt;\ \alpha, \ \alpha_0, \ \alpha_1, \ \alpha_2, \ \beta, \beta_0, \ \beta_1, \ \theta&lt;/math&gt;
|}

: &lt;math&gt;b(y,z)&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;d(y,z)&lt;/math&gt; represent the [[birth rate]] and [[death rate]] respectively. Both saturate as per capita output rises, in agreement with empirical studies ([[#jec95|Cohen, 1995]]).

The form of &lt;math&gt;f(x,y,p)&lt;/math&gt; follows from the [[I = PAT]] hypothesis.

== System behavior ==

Using the [[Scenario analysis]] technique, Sanderson ([[#san94|1994]]) studied two possible futures for the idealized world described by Wonderland. One future entitled ''Dream'', held out the possibility of unending sustainable growth, while the other termed ''Horror'', ended in environmental collapse and eventual extinction of the population. Subsequent work ([[#gk06|Kohring, 2006]]) showed that the parameters of the model can be bisected into two sets, one which always produces sustainable futures and one which always ends in collapse and extinction. Additionally, the equations of Wonderland exhibit [[chaotic behavior]] ([[#gr96|Gröller, et al., 1996]], [[#wgp97|Wegenkittl, et al., 1997]], [[#hl98|Leeves and Herbert, 1998]]).

== Avoiding collapse ==

In the basic model it is impossible to avoid or recover from the environmental collapse seen in the ''Horror'' scenario without changes to the model itself. Two such changes have been studied: 
pollution ''abatement'' and pollution ''avoidance''.

=== Pollution abatement ===
{{see also|Pollution control|Environmental mitigation}}
Abating the effects of pollution draws funds from other sources to pay for cleaning up the environment ([[#san94|Sanderson, 1994]]).  This decreases the value of &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt; entering into the equations for birth, &lt;math&gt;b&lt;/math&gt;, and death, &lt;math&gt;d&lt;/math&gt;:

:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
y^{\prime}=y-\phi(1-z)^{\mu}y
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

The time evolution of &lt;math&gt;y(t)&lt;/math&gt; is unaffected because those goods and services needed for pollution abatement must also be considered part of the overall output.  The impact of these changes on the environment is expressed by changes to &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt;:

: &lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
f(x,y,p)=xyp - \kappa\frac{e^{\epsilon \phi(1-z)^{\mu}yx}}{1+e^{\epsilon \phi(1-z)^{\mu}yx}}
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

These changes introduce three new parameters into the model:

{| class="wikitable"
|-
! Sector !! Parameter
|-
| Policy Levers || &lt;math&gt;\ \phi, \ \mu, \ \kappa&lt;/math&gt;
|}

By adjusting the policy levers, it is possible to clean up a polluted environment and recover from the collapse seen in the ''Horror'' scenario.  However, the recovery is only temporary, after a brief time of robust growth the system again collapses, leading to endless cycles of collapse followed by recovery. Abating pollution does not alter the fundamental division of the parameters into the two sets of sustainable and unsustainable futures ([[#gk06|Kohring, 2006]]).

=== Pollution avoidance ===
{{see also|Pollution prevention}}
Pollution avoidance aims to prevent pollution from entering into the environment, by making its production unprofitable. This is modeled by means of a pollution tax ([[#hl98|Herbert and Leeves, 1998]], [[#lpb03|Lempert, et al., 2003]]):

:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
y(t+1) &amp;= y(t)\left(1+\gamma-\left(\gamma+\eta\right)\Big[1-z(t)\Big]^{\lambda}-\gamma_0\,\frac{\tau}{1-\tau}\right),\\
p(t+1) &amp;= p(t)\left(1-\chi-\chi_0\frac{\tau}{1+\tau}\right).\\
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

The new parameters for the pollution avoidance model are:

{| class="wikitable"
|-
! Sector !! Parameter
|-
| Policy Levers || &lt;math&gt;\ \gamma_0, \ \chi_0, \ \tau&lt;/math&gt;
|}

With these changes, it is possible to raise the tax rate, &lt;math&gt;\tau&lt;/math&gt;, such that the system never collapses and the horror scenario is avoided altogether.  Regardless of the other parameters, it is always possible to increase &lt;math&gt;\tau&lt;/math&gt; in order to avoid collapse thereby enabling unending sustainable growth ([[#gk06|Kohring, 2006]]).

== Variations ==

=== Production function ===

Instead of the relatively simple economic growth equation used for &lt;math&gt;y(t)&lt;/math&gt; some researchers use a [[Cobb–Douglas]] production function instead ([[#lh02|Leeves and Herbert, 2002]]).

=== Multiple countries ===

The standard form of the Wonderland model contains a single, homogeneous entity.  Herbert et al. ([[#hbll05|2005]]) extended Wonderland to a multi-country model by allowing the different entities to use different sets parameters and assuming the outputs are coupled through trade flows.

=== Differential equations ===

Originally developed in terms of [[discrete time]], [[finite difference equation]]s, it is often recast as a set of continuous time [[differential equations]] ([[#gr96|Gröller, et al., 1996]])
