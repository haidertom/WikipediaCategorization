'''Aera Energy LLC''' (Aera) is a natural gas, oil exploration and production company jointly owned by [[Shell Oil Company]] and [[ExxonMobil]] headquartered in [[Bakersfield, California]]. In addition, Aera Energy LLC is a California [[limited liability company]], and one of California’s largest oil and natural gas producers, with an approximate 2015 revenues of over $2&amp;nbsp;billion. Aera is operated as a stand-alone company through its board of managers.&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;

===Coles Levee Ecosystem Preserve===
The Coles Levee Ecosystem Preserve, located about {{convert|20|mi|km}} southwest of [[Bakersfield, California|Bakersfield]], consists of {{convert|6059|acre|km2}} of habitat.&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt; More than a dozen  rare, threatened and endangered birds, animals and plant life can be found in the preserve. The preserve encompasses the last two miles (3&amp;nbsp;km) of riparian habitat along the [[Kern River]], where it drains into Buena Vista Lake.

Established in 1992 by [[ARCO]] and the [[California Department of Fish and Game]], the preserve was acquired by Aera in 1998. The preserve is largely riparian habitat and is surrounded by active oil fields (the North Coles Levee Oil Field and South Coles Levee Oil Field, as well as the [[Elk Hills Oil Field]] to the west, operated by California Resources Corporation.&lt;sup&gt;7&lt;/sup&gt;

===Real estate development===
As oil and gas production declines in the [[Los Angeles Basin]], Aera is planning to develop some property holdings in [[Orange County, California|Orange]] and [[Los Angeles County, California|Los Angeles]] counties for residential, commercial, and recreation uses while setting aside large portions of its property as natural open space.

The master planned community of Vista Del Verde, Aera’s first real estate development, followed the decommissioning  and cleanup of the {{convert|850|acre|km2|adj=on}} Yorba Linda oil field. The community includes housing, parks, an elementary school, and a city-owned golf course, Black Gold Golf Club.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.blackgoldgolf.com Black Gold Golf Club] Official website&lt;/ref&gt; As part of the development, Aera added more than {{convert|1000|acre|km2}} of adjacent, company-owned land to the [[Chino Hills State Park]], and provided funding for the restoration, enhancement, and maintenance of native habitats within the park.{{citation needed|date=June 2012}}

Two additional real estate projects are being planned. The Aera Master Planned Community would develop approximately {{convert|3000|acre|km2}} of company-owned land in unincorporated Los Angeles and Orange counties, approximately where the county line intersects the [[Orange Freeway|Orange Freeway (SR-57)]]. Part of the larger [[Brea-Olinda Oil Field]], the property has been used for oil operations dating back to the 1890s and cattle grazing operations since the 1850s. Aera is pursuing approvals to develop this property for residential and commercial uses while devoting more than {{convert|1500|acre|km2}} to recreation uses and open space restoration. The project will also preserve and enhance a wildlife corridor to improve regional open space connectivity.&lt;ref&gt;[http://aeracommunity.com/ Aera Master Planned Community] Official website&lt;/ref&gt;

Additionally, Aera owns a 50 percent interest in approximately {{convert|400|acre|km2}} known as the Newport Banning Ranch property on the western edge of the city of [[Newport Beach]]. Aera is a participant in Newport Banning Ranch, LLC, which has submitted a proposal to build 1,375 homes, parks, a coastal inn, and a small commercial center on about {{convert|153|acre|km2}} of the site, while preserving and restoring more than 55 percent of the property for open space and wildlife habitat uses. The project would remove oil facilities and restore the surface of most of the oil operations areas on the property, consolidating the remaining oil operations to two sites totaling about {{convert|20|acre|m2}}.&lt;ref&gt;Fry, Hannah (December 2, 2014) [http://www.dailypilot.com/news/tn-dpt-me-1203-banning-ranch-oil-drilling-20141202,0,1181832.story "Companies, Coastal Commission in dispute over Banning Ranch oil wells"] ''[[Daily Pilot]]''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://newportbanningranch.com/ Newport Banning Ranch] Official website&lt;/ref&gt;

Counting current plans and proposals in Orange and southeastern Los Angeles Counties, Aera estimates that about two-thirds of the original land position held by Aera and its predecessors in these areas has been or will ultimately be devoted to park, recreation or open space uses.

Nearly all large-scale projects proposed in metropolitan Southern California encounter opposition from neighbors and environmental groups, who often have competing visions for a given piece of property.  Aera’s projects are no exception. Opponents have raised environmental concerns and argued that new development will place an unacceptable strain on local water supplies, transportation infrastructure, schools and other public services.&lt;sup&gt;7&lt;/sup&gt;

The projects are currently being examined under the [[California Environmental Quality Act]], which provides a detailed process to examine projects, solicit input from a broad spectrum of individuals and public agencies, and give all stakeholders a voice in shaping projects prior to approval.

==Awards==
In 2002 Aera's [[South Belridge Oil Field|Belridge Producing Complex]] won the prestigious North American Maintenance Excellence (NAME) Award for its maintenance and reliability program and results. &lt;sup&gt;8&lt;/sup&gt; In 2004 Aera's [[Midway-Sunset Oil Field|North Midway Sunset Unit]] was awarded a NAME Award.&lt;sup&gt;8&lt;/sup&gt; Aera is the first oil exploration and production company to win the award previously given only to manufacturing organizations. In 2011 Aera’s development team was awarded the [http://www.ame.org Association for Manufacturing Excellence] (AME) Manufacturing Excellence Award. Aera is the first energy company to receive the award.&lt;sup&gt;9&lt;/sup&gt;

'''Ali Hatem Abd al-Razzaq Ali al-Suleiman al-Assafi al-Dulaimi''' ({{lang-ar|'''علي حاتم السليمان'''}}) (born 1971) is a Sunni sheikh in [[Al Anbar Governorate|Anbar province]]. He is the former Emir of the [[Dulaim]] tribe, a position now held by his brother, Abdulrazzaq Hatem Abd al-Razzaq Ali al-Suleiman al-Assafi al-Dulaimi.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Inoma |first=Ali |date=14 March 2014 |title=Anbar witnesses political divide amid ongoing clashes |url=http://www.al-monitor.com/pulse/originals/2014/03/iraq-anbar-political-divide-ongoing-military-operations.html#?v=1362363401000??v=1362363401000? |newspaper=Al-Monitor |location=Anbar, Iraq |publisher= |accessdate= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==
Suleiman was born in Baghdad in 1971.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.marines.mil/Portals/59/Publications/Al-Anbar%20Awakening%20Vol%20II_Iraqi%20Perspectives%20%20PCN%2010600001200_1.pdf Al-Anbar Awakening Vol II: Iraqi Perspectives, p.107]&lt;/ref&gt;
He is the former emir of the [[Dulaim]] tribe, one of the largest Arab tribes in Iraq. Its members are predominantly located in the western province of Anbar.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.aawsat.net/2014/06/article55333359&lt;/ref&gt;

==Iraq War==
Following the 2003 invasion of Iraq, Suleiman joined the Iraqi insurgency.  His own tribe formed the nucleus of the resistance\insurgency against US forces and Shiite government forces in Iraq, due to the bombing of Fallujah and the targeting of Sunnis in Baghdad. However, in 2006 he and his armed tribesmen turned against Al-Qaeda, due to their often indiscriminate use of violence, as well as the fact that Al-Qaeda did not give enough respect to Anbar's sheikhs.&lt;ref name="Hufpo"&gt;{{cite news |last=Manfredi |first=Federico |date=16 August 2010 |title=Iraq's Crooked Politicians: Talking With Sheik Ali Hatem, Leader of the Sunni Awakening Councils |url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/federico-manfredi/iraqs-crooked-politicians_b_683537.html |newspaper=The Huffington Post |location= |publisher= |accessdate= }}&lt;/ref&gt; After leaving the insurgency, Suleiman became an important figure in Anbar.  He formed a local police force of 60 thousand gunman from his tribe in Anbar.&lt;ref name="Hufpo"/&gt;

Suleiman formed a political party, [[National Front for the Salvation of Iraq]], in 2008. It ran as part of the State of Law Coalition of Prime Minister Nour al-Maliki, but quickly disagreements appeared, after the arrest of 10 men from his tribe in Ar Rutba, by the Karbala police.  In response to the incident, Suleiman threaten to declare the State of Anbar. Suleiman formed another party (Baariq Iraq). However, his political party was banned from participating in the elections in 2014.

After the withdrawal of US troops, the Shiite government forces started to arrest Dulaimi civilians and killed them in Anbar. Suleiman, his brother Sheikh Abdulrazzaq, and other sheikhs of the tribe set up weekly demonstrations in Ramadi in the Square of Pride and Dignity, for one year, demanding the release of Sunni detainees and the withdrawal of the army from the cities in Anbar.  The government responded by killing ali al-Alwani and arresting his brother, Sunni MP Ahmed al-Alwani, from the Dulaim tribe (Albo-alon clan).  As a result, the Dulaimis returned to the armed insurgency led by Suleiman.

Suleiman formed the Military Council of the tribal rebels in Al-Anbar.  He announced in a statement that Sunni territories will not be part of Iraq under Shiite rule.

==2013–14 anti-government offensives==
[[File:Flag of the Revolutionary Tribal Council.svg|thumb|Flag of Suleiman's group, the Revolutionary Tribal Council.]]
In 2013 and 2014, Suleiman was the leader of the ''Anbar Tribes Revolutionary Council'', an anti-government militant group active in the ongoing [[Anbar clashes (2013–14)|Anbar clashes]]. Unlike some of the other groups active in anti-government activity, Suleiman's force does not advocate the overthrow of the Iraqi government, but instead is limited in ambition to defending Anbar from what it sees as aggression from the Iraqi central government.&lt;ref name="FP"&gt;{{cite news|last=Sowell |first=Kirk H. |date=15 January 2014 |title=Maliki's Anbar Blunder |url=http://mideastafrica.foreignpolicy.com/posts/2014/01/15/maliki_s_anbar_blunder |newspaper= |location= |publisher=Foreign Policy |accessdate= |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140705054624/http://mideastafrica.foreignpolicy.com/posts/2014/01/15/maliki_s_anbar_blunder |archivedate=5 July 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Suleiman has also been involved in the [[Northern Iraq offensive (June 2014)|2014 Northern Iraq offensive]], and he claims that ISIS only constitutes 5-7% of the anti-government forces. He claims that the majority of fighters are from Iraq's Sunni tribes. Suleiman has also claimed that these tribal forces would be able to defeat ISIS, were the Maliki-run Iraqi government to withdraw government forces from North and North-Central Iraq.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Koplowitz |first=Howard |date=16 June 2014 |title=Iraq Crisis Update: ISIS Seizes Tal Afar Amid Conflicting Reports Of Clashes Near Baghdad [MAP] |url=http://www.ibtimes.com/iraq-crisis-update-isis-seizes-tal-afar-amid-conflicting-reports-clashes-near-baghdad-map-1602456 |newspaper=International Business Times |location= |publisher= |accessdate= }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, Suleiman claimed that tribal forces would not fight ISIS until Maliki was removed from office and Sunnis are given their rights.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Brown |first=Matt |date=16 June 2014 |title=Execution images underline Iraq's deepening crisis |url=http://www.abc.net.au/7.30/content/2014/s4026454.htm |newspaper=Australian Broadcasting Corporation |location= |publisher= |accessdate= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Anglesey Aluminium''' Metal Ltd, which shut down on 30 September 2009, was a joint venture between the [[Rio Tinto Group]] and [[Kaiser Aluminum]].

Its [[aluminium smelter]], located on the outskirts of [[Holyhead]], was one of the largest employers in [[North Wales]], with 540 staff members, and began to produce aluminium in 1971. It was built on the [[Penrhos, Anglesey|Penrhos Estate]], 500 acres of which were sold by the [[Stanley family]] for the project. Until recently it produced up to 142,000 tonnes of aluminium every year and was the biggest single user of electricity (255 MW) in the United Kingdom.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

[[Alumina]] and [[coke (fuel)|coke]] shipped from [[Jamaica]] and [[Australia]] would berth at the company's private jetty in Holyhead harbour. This jetty is linked by a series of conveyor belts passing through tunnels to the plant.  A spur rail link from the main [[North Wales Coast Line|Holyhead to London rail line]] runs into the plant and was used for both receipt of raw materials and despatch of aluminium.

The plant was powered from the [[National Grid (UK)|National Grid]] and received most of its electricity from [[Wylfa nuclear power station]] 15 miles away. AA was used as a base load for Wylfa and saved the grid the cost of keeping a power station on standby. The power contract terminated in 2009, and the aluminium smelting operation was shut down as no new contract was negotiated.&lt;ref name=bbc-20090930&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/wales/north_west/8281699.stm |title=Final shift at Anglesey Aluminium |work=BBC News |date=30 September 2009 |accessdate=21 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://business.timesonline.co.uk/tol/business/industry_sectors/natural_resources/article5526677.ece|title=The end for UK’s biggest energy user as Rio Tinto shuts Anglesey aluminium smelter|author=David Robertson and Carl Mortished|date=16 January 2009|publisher=The Times|accessdate=2009-02-07 | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; The company has announced tentative plans for a [[biomass]] plant on the site, but smelting operations have been halted and the plant mothballed until 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

Near the smelter the Aluminium Powder Company (ALPOCO) produces aluminium powder, which is used in pastes, pigments, chemicals, metallurgy, refractory, propulsion, pyrotechnics, spray deposition and powder metallurgy. Adjacent to the site is the public access [[Penrhos Country Park]].

An '''Autographic Register''' is a business machine invented in 1883 by James C. Shoup.  The device consisted two separate rolls of paper interleaved with [[carbon paper]]. Usually one or both of the rolls would be preprinted with form information. To operate the machine the user would write, for example, a sales receipt and the machine automatically produced a copy. The crank on the machine ejected the records and moved a blank form into view.  The original receipt produced would go to the user and the copy was filed.&lt;ref name=BusRef&gt;{{cite web|title=Standard Register Co.|url=http://www.referenceforbusiness.com/history2/4/Standard-Register-Co.html|website=Reference for Business|accessdate=June 14, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Shoup founded the Autographic Register Company in [[Hoboken, NJ]] to manufacture his invention.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://hoboken.pastperfectonline.com/bysearchterm?keyword=Autographic+Register+Company|website=Hoboken Historical Museum Online Collections Database|title=Autographic Register Company|accessdate=June 14, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Autographic Register was an advance over use of separate forms and carbon paper as it guaranteed that the copy was made and kept the forms in relative alignment. A number of advancements were soon made, including the use of sprocket-fed paper, invented by Theodore Schirmer. This helped avoid slippage and misalignment of forms, allowing more copies to be produced simultaneously. In 1912 Schirmer founded the [[Standard Register Industrial|Standard Register Company]] in [[Dayton, Ohio]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Standard Register|title=100 Years of Innovation|url=http://media.standardregister.com/standard-register/docs/company/Centennial-Whitepaper.pdf|accessdate=June 14, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The invention of sprocket-fed paper later found use in computer printers.

Although the Autographic Register has been largely replaced by newer technology it remains in use as of 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Portable Register - Plastic Register for 4 x 6 Forms|url=https://www.deluxe.com/shopdeluxe/pd/portable-register-plastic-register-for-4-x-6-forms/_/A-D924|website=Deluxe Enterprise Operations|accessdate=June 14, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bjerke received his PhD from the [[Lund University]], where he kept working for some years. Later he held professorships at the [[Waikato University]] in [[New Zealand]], the [[King Fahd University of Petroleum and Minerals]] in [[Saudi Arabia]], [[University of Maiduguri]] in Nigeria and the [[University of Southern California]].

Bjerke's research interests "centre around [[methodologies]] in order to study [[entrepreneurship]], the role of [[marketing]] in successful entrepreneurships and successful regions of growth and entrepreneurship’s role in this connection".&lt;ref name = "Vitae"/&gt;

The objective of CBBC is to assist UK organisations to do business in China, to work with Chinese companies in the UK and to support UK-China partnerships in third markets. It works in close collaboration with the [[Department for International Trade]] (DIT), for whom it delivers China business development services.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Study Links Scoop Shortlist {{!}} Bradford Chamber of Commerce|url = http://bradford.wnychamber.co.uk/study-links-scoop-shortlist/|website = bradford.wnychamber.co.uk|accessdate = 2015-12-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

CBBC also cooperates closely with the private sector and trade associations, the British Embassy and Consulates in China; the British Chambers of Commerce in China, and the [[Local enterprise partnership|Local Enterprise Partnerships]] (LEPs) in the UK and the Devolved Administrations, as well as local chambers and other relevant organisations across the UK.

In addition, CBBC organises missions to the Chinese market; identifies business opportunities; and provides research as well as a range of other practical services for UK companies in the market.

CBBC also hosts inward delegations from China, arranges events in the UK and China, and hosts business events for all senior Chinese leaders visiting the UK.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = China–Britain Business Council {{!}} インターネット内の検索結果 {{!}} cyclopaedia.net|url = http://www.cyclopaedia.asia/wiki/China%25E2%2580%2593Britain_Business_Council|website = www.cyclopaedia.asia|accessdate = 2015-12-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

CBBC operates has a staff based in 11 regions in the UK and 13 cities in China. The main China office is in [[Beijing]], while the other offices are located in [[Shanghai]], [[Shenzhen]], [[Wuhan]], [[Chengdu]], [[Qingdao]], [[Nanjing]], [[Hangzhou]], [[Shenyang]], [[Guangzhou]], [[Chongqing]], [[Xi'an|Xi'An]] and [[Changsha]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Doing Business in China 2014 - Edinburgh|url = http://www.slideshare.net/DigitalContent/doing-business-in-china-2014-edinburgh|date = 2014-03-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

CBBC also provides an in-house research service that is specifically tailored to the needs of each company. All research is carried out by CBBC's project managers across the China offices. CBBC has conducted such research projects in a wide range of sectors, including both product and service industries.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.cbbc.org&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==

The organisation's history dates back to the early 1950s when British companies were among the first to trade with Communist China. That was the 48 Group of Companies (established in April 1954). At the same time, the British government had a semi-official trade body known as the Sino-British Trade Council&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = AIM25 text-only browsing: School of Oriental and African Studies: China Association|url = http://www.aim25.ac.uk/cats/19/65.htm|website = www.aim25.ac.uk|accessdate = 2015-12-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; which promoted British participation in trade fairs and exhibitions in China.  Although the UK was the first Western country to recognize the People's Republic of China, the PRC did not fully recognize the UK until 1972 (see [[Sino-British relations]]).

The China–Britain Trade Group was established in 1991 when the 48 Group merged with Sino-British Trade Council,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = 48 Group Club  {{!}} About The Club|url = http://the48groupclub.com/the-club/about-the-club/|website = the48groupclub.com|accessdate = 2015-12-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; at the instigation of the (then) UK Department of Trade and Industry.

After the first six months, CBTG had a membership of 100 British companies, large and small, paying an annual subscription. Members were able to attend exclusive meetings with Chinese visitors, attend specialist workshops, and had priority access to special events.

A big incentive of membership for many was the provision of services by the CBTG's two China offices. As the number of offices grew, CBTG continued to offer this service to members, and it is still a benefit of membership today.

The early 1990s saw a renewal of high-level visits from China to the UK  In November 1992 vice-premier Zhu Rongji was the first Chinese leader to take part in a seminar with British business in the UK, when the Stock Exchange was the venue for presentations from privatised industries, organised by CBTG and the Stock Exchange.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = The China-Britain Business Council (CBBC) {{!}} ChinaGoAbroad|url = http://www.chinagoabroad.com/en/contributor/china-britain-business-council-cbbc|website = www.chinagoabroad.com|accessdate = 2015-12-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The biggest events of the mid-1990s were the huge business groups taken to China by Michael Heseltine, as trade minister in 1995, then as deputy prime minister in 1996. CBTG was involved in putting together the business groups which accompanied the deputy prime minister. In 1996 a decision was made to allow member companies to appoint representatives in China and rent space in CBTG offices, which would provide services to them. Visiting CBTG Beijing that year, Michael Heseltine coined a name for this service: the China Launchpad. This has since become a popular service which the China–Britain Business Council still offer UK companies.

The return of Hong Kong to Chinese sovereignty in 1997 led to warmer relations with the UK. Less than a month after his appointment as premier in 1998, Zhu Rongji was back in the UK, where a CBTG dinner in London's Guildhall attracted 900 guests.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Moments, meetings and milestones{{!}}2015 Xi Visit UK{{!}}chinadaily.com.cn|url = http://europe.chinadaily.com.cn/2015-10/19/content_22265931.htm|website = europe.chinadaily.com.cn|accessdate = 2015-12-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

That year, the organisation changed its name to the China–Britain Business Council (CBBC), to reflect the growth of all round business between the UK and China encompassing investment, trade, licensing and other forms of business activity.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = China – Britain Business Council (CBBC) {{!}} Corporate NGO partnerships|url = http://www.globalhand.org/en/organisations/13927|website = www.globalhand.org|accessdate = 2015-12-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 1999, the UK received the first head of state from the People's Republic of China, Jiang Zemin, who was greeted by a CBBC organised business lunch at the Banqueting House.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title = Treaty and trade|url = http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/7732842c-9905-11dd-9d48-000077b07658.html#axzz3te3CIB4Q|newspaper = Financial Times|date = 2008-10-14|access-date = 2015-12-07|issn = 0307-1766}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the UK, CBBC's promotion of opportunities in China has never stopped. In its first year, there began a long tradition of organising a nationwide programme of seminars and conferences. Since then there has been a continuous programme of conferences and seminars with VIP speakers, briefings around the country for groups of exporters, and meetings with Chinese industrial and provincial leaders.

Lord Powell, a former foreign affairs adviser to Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher, took over the presidency of CBBC in 1998.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = CBBF Issue 37, June 14|url = http://content.yudu.com/Library/A2z5ou/CBBFIssue37June14/resources/32.htm|website = content.yudu.com|accessdate = 2015-12-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; His first task was to accompany Prime Minister Tony Blair to China with a business delegation. The following year saw visits to the UK by then Vice-Premier Wen Jiabao,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Chinese Vice-premier Meets CBBC President|url = http://www.china.org.cn/english/international/41905.htm|website = www.china.org.cn|accessdate = 2015-12-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; and President Jiang Zemin.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Visit by President Jiang Zemin to Six Countries in Europe, Africa and Asia|url = http://www.fmprc.gov.cn/mfa_eng/ziliao_665539/3602_665543/3604_665547/t18049.shtml|website = www.fmprc.gov.cn|accessdate = 2015-12-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; CCPIT chairman Wan Jifei followed in 2001, and in October that year, the then Vice-President Hu Jintao also came to the UK.

Sir [[David William Brewer|David Brewer]], Former Lord Mayor of the City or London, became CBBC Chairman in 2007, and continued to push forward CBBC's contribution to UK-China trade and business exchange, and he has now, through his career, made well over 100 trips to China.

In the new millennium, China's economic strength has grown exponentially, intensified by WTO accession in 2001. As China opens its door wider to foreign participation, new trade promotion sectors have emerged including education, leisure, branding and communications technologies, and CBBCs regular trade missions in numerous sectors reflect this. Outsourcing has become a major field of operations as most companies looking to outsource production will consider China. Simultaneously, as the world's fastest growing market, most exporters will look at the Chinese market.

Though the pioneering feel of the early years may have gone, and China has changed beyond all recognition since that time, CBBC is still filling a vital role of informing, advising, and organising services for British business in China.&lt;ref&gt;China-Britain Business Review – 50th Anniversary Edition&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2013, [[James Sassoon, Baron Sassoon|Lord James Sassoon]] was announced as the new CBBC Chairman.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Lord Sassoon|url = http://www.parliament.uk/biographies/lords/lord-sassoon/4146|website = UK Parliament|accessdate = 2015-12-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was also the year that CBBC celebrated the 60th anniversary of its founding.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = 'New heights' in Sino-British trade and investment  - Chinadaily.com.cn|url = http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/world/2013cameronvisitcn/2013-12/03/content_17147386.htm|website = www.chinadaily.com.cn|accessdate = 2015-12-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; China-Britain business relations have become strong in recent years with the support of CBBC. In 2014, Chinese premier Li Keqiang visited the UK with Lord Sassoon jointly hosting a state dinner on honour of Mr Li, attended by 650 British and Chinese political and business dignitaries.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = UK poised to push for more Chinese investment|url = https://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/businesslatestnews/10901635/UK-poised-to-push-for-more-Chinese-investment.html|website = Telegraph.co.uk|accessdate = 2015-12-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2015, Lord Sassoon as Chairman of CBBC hosted the UK-China Business Summit during President XI Jinping's visit to the UK.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = UK-China Business Summit held in London|url = http://ceab.co/index.php/zh/joomla/contentall-comcontent-views/list-all-categories/40-news-en/485-uk-china-business-summit-held-in-london|website = ceab.co|accessdate = 2015-12-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4060">'''Cummings Research Park''', located primarily in the city of [[Huntsville, Alabama]] is the second largest research park in the country and the fourth largest in the world. It is one of the world’s leading science and technology business parks, with a mixture of Fortune 500 companies, local and international high-tech enterprises, U.S. space and defense agencies, thriving business incubators and competitive higher-education institutions. CRP is the home of nearly 300 companies, more than 26,000 employees and 12,500 students. The Park's major industries are aerospace, defense, engineering, biotechnology, advanced manufacturing, software development, information technology and cyber security.


Cummings Research Park was voted as the Most Outstanding Science Park in the World in 1997 by the Association of University Research Parks and in 2017 The Park was presented with the Developing Communities of Innovation award.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.huntsvillealabamausa.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=169&amp;Itemid=332 Huntsville Chamber of Commerce - CRP History]&lt;/ref&gt;

==History ==

In 1961, [[Milton K. Cummings]], then president of [[Teledyne Brown Engineering|Brown Engineering Company]], and Joseph C. Moquin, his later successor, selected a tract of undeveloped land on the western edge of Huntsville for building a new headquarters.  Located adjacent to land that had recently been acquired by the [[University of Alabama]] for developing a Huntsville Branch and within a few miles of major Army and NASA development centers on [[Redstone Arsenal]], this area was ideal for establishing a high-technology research park.

Cummings and Moquin, with the support of rocket pioneer [[Wernher von Braun]], proposed that the City of Huntsville zone the area as a research park district. In 1962, the City established this zoning, with 3,000 acres of land officially designated Huntsville Research Park.

Brown Engineering (later [[Teledyne Technologies#Companies|Teledyne Brown Engineering]]) was the first to build in the park, opening its campus the inaugural year. As America rushed into the space race, other companies quickly followed; these included giant national firms such as [[Lockheed Martin|Lockheed]], [[Northrop Grumman|Northrop]], and [[IBM]], smaller outside firms wanting to open Huntsville operations, and a number of newly organized local enterprises.

In parallel with the growth of industry occupants, the adjacent academic campus also matured; in 1970, this became the [[University of Alabama in Huntsville]] (UAH). The UAH Foundation owned a large portion of land in the research park district, and served as a major promoter of development. When Milton Cummings died in 1973, the district was renamed the Cummings Research Park (CRP). By the end of the 1970s, the development of what is now known as CRP East was nearing completion.

In 1982, the second major phase of CRP was launched with the planned development of CRP West. A substantial new parcel of land, exceeding 800 acres, was purchased and a master plan was established by the City of Huntsville. This new phase strengthened the development restrictions on the park, rivaling, and in many instances exceeding, the quality of planned research and development parks anywhere in the world. The City of Huntsville has continued to acquire land for future growth of CRP, and it is now approaching 4,000 acres.

The '''Cyprus State Fairs Authority (CSFA)''' was established in 1968 as a semi-government organisation in order to run and promote the annual Cyprus International Fair. It has since expanded and runs several annual and biannual events such as the education fair, and the Cyprus motor show.

The largest event the '''Cyprus International Fair''' was first held in 1975. Since then it has steadily grown and in currently has around 130,000 visitors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Jean |last=Christou |coauthors= |title=State fair expects 130,000 visitors |date=May 26, 2006 |publisher= |url=http://www.cyprus-mail.com/news/main.php?id=26052&amp;archive=1 |work=[[Cyprus Mail]] |pages= |accessdate=2007-05-16 |language= |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070930014604/http://www.cyprus-mail.com/news/main.php?id=26052&amp;archive=1 |archivedate=2007-09-30 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2007 the CSFA announced a decision to rename the event to '''Expo-Cyprus'''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first= |last= |coauthors= |title=Cyprus Int'l Fair opens, changes name to EXPO – CYPRUS |date=10/05/2007 |publisher= |url=http://www.financialmirror.com/more_news.php?id=6909&amp;type=st&amp;nt=Politics |work=[[Financial Mirror]] |pages= |accessdate=2007-05-16 |language= |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070928090038/http://www.financialmirror.com/more_news.php?id=6909&amp;type=st&amp;nt=Politics |archivedate=2007-09-28 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The grounds of the state fair moved to their current location in the [[Nicosia]] suburb of Makedonitissa in the early 1970s and have undergone several phases of expansion since. Currently they cover an area of 30,000m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; of indoor space and 100,000m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; of outdoor grounds. Apart from hosting exhibitions the grounds have at times been used for other purposes such as music concerts, large rave parties even as a service station for the Cyprus arm of the [[Middle East Rally]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | first= | last= | coauthors= | title=MERC - Troodos Rally Victory For Nasser Al Attiyah | date=April 23, 2007 | publisher= | url =http://rallyplanet.com/index.php?pid=31788 | work =RallyPlanet | pages = | accessdate = 2007-05-16 | language = }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2006 the [[Diplomatic missions of the United States|American Embassy]] to Cyprus was allowed to use two large exhibition halls as temporary accommodation to house the thousands&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Jean |last=Christou |coauthors= |title=US must take responsibility to move its citizens on |date=2006-08-04 |publisher= |url=http://www.cyprus-mail.com/news/main.php?id=27195&amp;archive=1 |work=[[Cyprus Mail]] |pages= |accessdate=2007-05-16 |language= |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927202949/http://www.cyprus-mail.com/news/main.php?id=27195&amp;archive=1 |archivedate=2007-09-27 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; of American citizens evacuated from the [[2006 Lebanon War|war in Lebanon]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Jacqueline |last=Theodoulou |coauthors= |title=Children safe with parents as evacuees flood in |date=2006-07-20 |publisher= |url=http://www.cyprus-mail.com/news/main.php?id=26923&amp;archive=1 |work=[[Cyprus Mail]] |pages= |accessdate=2007-05-16 |language= |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927203325/http://www.cyprus-mail.com/news/main.php?id=26923&amp;archive=1 |archivedate=2007-09-27 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Constantine |last=Markides |coauthors= |title=Some people just don't know how lucky they are |date=2006-07-23 |publisher= |url=http://www.cyprus-mail.com/news/main.php?id=27007&amp;archive=1 |work=[[Cyprus Mail]] |pages= |accessdate=2007-05-16 |language= |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927203206/http://www.cyprus-mail.com/news/main.php?id=27007&amp;archive=1 |archivedate=2007-09-27 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="20625">The '''Essar leaks''' include e-mails, office memos, telephone conversations and other records allegedly leaked from the systems of the Indian business conglomerate [[Essar Group]]. The leaked records allegedly contain evidence of politician-corporate nexus in India, and show how business interests unfairly manipulate Indian government and judiciary.

In 2015, an unnamed [[whistleblower]] leaked a set of internal e-mails and memos from the Essar Group, alleging that the conglomerate had granted favours to several politicians, bureaucrats and journalists. Essar denied the allegations, terming the alleged favours as "common courtesies" that are legally justifiable. Essar also claimed that some of the leaked material was fabricated, and was being used to [[blackmail]] them.

In May 2016, lawyer Suren Uppal reported the existence of a new set of secretly recorded conversations to the [[Prime Minister of India|Prime Minister]]. The conversations involve influential politicians, bureaucrats, businesspeople, bankers, and other [[very important person|VIP]]s. Uppal claimed to have received these tapes from the former Essar employee Albasit Khan, and alleged that the Essar officials illegally [[telephone tapping|tapped]] these conversations during the 2000s. In June 2016, after the ''[[Outlook (magazine)|Outlook]]'' magazine made Uppal's claims public, Khan denied Essar's role in tapping the conversations. He acknowledged the existence of the tapes, but stated he had received these tapes from the now-deceased [[Mumbai Police]] officer [[Vijay Salaskar]], a claim denied by Mumbai Police. According to Khan, the ultimate source and authenticity of the tapes are unknown. He admitted to having informed Uppal about the tapes, but accused Uppal of fabricating the Essar link to extort money from the business. Uppal denied the allegations, and promised to release the tapes to the [[Supreme Court of India]]. Essar completely denied the story, accusing Suren Uppal of being an extortionist.

== Background ==

=== 2015 leak: E-mails and memos ===

In 2015, a [[whistleblower]] approached lawyer-activist [[Prashant Bhushan]], and leaked a set of internal e-mails and memos from Essar Group. The material indicated that Essar Group had granted favours to several politicians, bureaucrats and journalists. This led to allegations that Essar had been trying to unfairly influence public policy and opinion. Bhushan's [[Centre for Public Interest Litigation]] (CPIL) filed a [[Public interest litigation in India|PIL]] before the [[Supreme Court of India]], requesting an investigation into these allegations.&lt;ref name="Caravan_needful"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.caravanmagazine.in/reportage/doing-needful-essar-industry-influence |title=Doing The Needful |author=Krishn Kaushik |publisher=Caravan |date=1 August 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Essar Group filed an affidavit seeking dismissal of the PIL, calling the favours as legally justifiable "common courtesies".&lt;ref name="IE_courtesies"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://indianexpress.com/article/india/india-news-india/essar-calls-its-favours-to-government-officials-common-courtesies/ |title=Essar Group calls its favours to govt officials ‘common courtesies’ |author=Utkarsh Anand |newspaper=Indian Express |date=26 November 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== 2016 leak: Phone tapping ===

On 1 June 2016, the Delhi-based lawyer Suren Uppal submitted a 29-page complaint to [[Prime Minister of India|Prime Minister]] [[Narendra Modi]] alleging that Essar had [[telephone tapping|tapped]] VIP conversations during 2000s.&lt;ref name="IE_PMO_gets"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://indianexpress.com/article/india/india-news-india/essar-tapped-ambani-brothers-suresh-prabhu-atal-bihari-vajpayee-pmo-staff-rajiv-mehrishi-2857573/ |title=PMO gets complaint: Essar allegedly tapped Ambani brothers, Suresh Prabhu, Vajpayee PMO staff |newspaper=Indian Express |author=Ritu Sarin |date=17 June 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Uppal, the Essar Group had carried out the [[cellphone surveillance|surveillance]] on the Prime Minister's Office (starting with [[Premiership of Atal Bihari Vajpayee|A. B. Vajpayee]]), the cabinet ministers, government bureaucrats and rival businesspeople.&lt;ref name="Outlook_dismiss"/&gt;

According to Uppal, the tapping was done under the supervision of Albasit Khan (or Basit Khan), a former head of security and vigilance at Essar Group. Uppal claims to be Khan's former legal representative, and has alleged that Khan was forced to resign from Essar in 2011, after being accused of keeping back some of the recorded conversations.&lt;ref name="IE_PMO_gets"/&gt; He has alleged that "special mobile SIM cards or the mobile interceptor mobile SIM cards" were used to tap the conversations.&lt;ref name="IE_PMO_gets"/&gt; Until 2005, the surveillance was carried out over the [[BPL Mobile]] network, which had been under Essar's control. The network was also used by Essar's rival [[Reliance Industries Limited]] (RIL), which allowed Essar to tap their conversations. However, RIL moved out of this network after 2005. After that, Essar allegedly used [[Hutchison Essar|Hutchison]] network for the tapping.&lt;ref name="Outlook_dismiss"/&gt;

In June 2016, the ''[[Outlook (magazine)|Outlook]]'' magazine published a report on these tapped conversations.&lt;ref name="TNM_pillars"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.thenewsminute.com/article/outlooks-essar-leaks-claim-reliance-remotely-controls-all-pillars-indian-democracy-45001 |title=Outlook's Essar leaks: Tapes claim Reliance remotely controls all pillars of Indian democracy |publisher=The News Minute |date=17 June 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Subsequently, Albasit Khan told the media that Essar had not recorded these conversations, and stated that their source and authenticity were unknown. Khan acknowledged the existence of tapes containing the conversations, but stated that the [[Mumbai Police]] officer [[Vijay Salaskar]] had given these tapes to him for "safekeeping" in 2005. Mumbai Police denied this, and ''Outlook'' doubted Khan's claim, pointing out that the tapes include conversations from as late as 2011.&lt;ref name="Outlook_dismiss"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.outlookindia.com/website/story/mumbai-police-dismiss-essar-whistle-blowers-claim-that-crime-branch-was-tapes-so/296982 |title=Mumbai Police Dismiss Essar Whistle-Blower's Claim That Crime Branch Was Tapes' Source |publisher=Outlook |author=Meetu Jain |date=18 June 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Khan admitted that had had met Uppal in January 2016, and had informed him about the tapes. But he denied hiring Uppal as his lawyer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.catchnews.com/india-news/essar-leaks-how-the-story-changed-overnight-1466238985.html |title=Essar leaks: How the story changed overnight |author=Charu Kartikeya |publisher=Catch News |date=18 June 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Khan alleged Uppal of fabricating the Essar link to extort money from the business.&lt;ref name="IE_slams"/&gt; In response, Uppal claimed that he and Khan had been working to "expose" the tapping, but Khan backed out under Essar Group's influence. He promised to hand over the alleged tapes to the [[Supreme Court of India|Supreme Court]] as part of a [[Public interest litigation in India|Public Interest Litigation]] (PIL).&lt;ref name="IE_slams"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://indianexpress.com/article/india/india-news-india/vvips-phone-tapping-ex-essar-employee-slams-lawyer-suren-uppal-who-in-turn-shows-emails-to-establish-link-2859990/ |title=Ex-Essar employee slams lawyer Uppal who, in turn, shows emails to ‘establish link’ |author=Ritu Sarin |newspaper=Indian Express |date=18 June 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Content of the leaks ==

The Essar leaks allegedly show that the businesses unfair influencely influenced the Indian government and judiciary during both [[United Progressive Alliance|UPA]] and [[National Democratic Alliance (India)|NDA]] tenures.&lt;ref name="TNM_pillars"/&gt; The leaks include the following:

* A November 2002 conversation between politicians Amar Singh and Kunwar Akhilesh Singh reveals how Amar Singh lobbied in favour of [[Reliance Petroleum]] as a member of the Joint Parliamentary Committee.&lt;ref name="TNM_pillars"/&gt;
* A December 2002 converstaion between RIL executives Mukesh Ambani and Satish Seth discusses how the Supreme Court was "managed" through minister [[Pramod Mahajan]].&lt;ref name="TNM_pillars"/&gt;
* In another conversation, Mukesh Ambani and Satish Seth discuss how to break the [[Cellular Operators Association of India]] by paying millions to MP [[Rajeev Chandrasekhar]] and the [[BPL Mobile]] founder.&lt;ref name="TNM_pillars"/&gt;
* In a June 2009 memo, senior executive Sunil Bajaj suggested giving 200 high-end cell phones to senior politicians and bureaucrats of the new UPA government, in order to "invest on right people at the right places for reaping long-term benefits". He stated that [[Airtel]] and [[Reliance Telecom|Reliance]] were already "experiencing the benefits" of this strategy.&lt;ref name="Caravan_needful"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://indianexpress.com/article/india/india-others/wooing-politicians-with-high-end-phones-journalists-with-cabs/ |title=Essar Leaks: Wooing politicians with high-end phones, journalists with cabs |author=Appu Esthose Suresh and Ritu Sarin |newspaper=Indian Express |date=27 February 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* In another 2009 e-mail, Sunil Bajaj suggested earmarking at least 200 recruitment slots for job referrals from powerful politicians and bureaucrats. He argued that the recommended candidates were often "highly qualified", so the company would not have a problem hiring them.&lt;ref name="Caravan_needful"/&gt;
* Later e-mails from 2012 and 2013 show that Essar hired at least 60 people recommended by VIPs, which included:&lt;ref name="Caravan_needful"/&gt;&lt;ref name="IE_courtesies"/&gt;
** [[Beni Prasad Verma]], [[Indian National Congress]] (INC)
** [[Digvijaya Singh]], INC
** [[Prabhat Jha (politician)|Prabhat Jha]], [[Bharatiya Janata Party|BJP]]
** Mohan Prakash, INC general secretary
** [[Motilal Vora]], INC
** Sanjeev Kumar, private secretary to the contemporary INC Minister for Petroleum &amp; Natural Gas
** [[Sriprakash Jaiswal]], INC
** [[Varun Gandhi]], BJP
** [[Yashbant Narayan Singh Laguri]], [[Biju Janata Dal]]
* In one e-mail, Essar's corporate communications executive stated that she had "coordinated" a story about Essar's involvement in the [[2G spectrum case]], in the magazines ''[[Tehelka]]'' and ''[[Business Today (business magazine)|Business Today]]''. Prashant Bhushan identified the ''Tehelka'' story as ''Madness in CBI's method'', written by the journalist [[Ashish Khetan]] (now an [[Aam Aadmi Party]] [[Member of the Legislative Assembly (India)|MLA]]). In this article, Khetan criticized the [[Central Bureau of Investigation]] for unfairly targeting Essar in the scam investigation. The article was published in December 2011, a month after Essar paid Tehelka {{INR}} 30 million as sponsorship amount for the magazine's ''Think Fest'' event.&lt;ref name="Caravan_needful"/&gt;
* A set of e-mails reveal that the Steel ministry's joint secretary Syedain Abbasi was granted accommodation at Essar's guest house in Delhi, although he was eligible for government-granted accommodation. In a 2013 email, the Essar executive Rajamani Krishnamurti describes Abbasi as "a very important person" who was handling the "majority of Essar’s issues". The e-mail reveals that Abbasi had advised Essar to oppose a particular government proposal through industry bodies such as [[ASSOCHAM]], [[Confederation of Indian Industry|CII]], and [[Federation of Indian Chambers of Commerce &amp; Industry|FICCI]].&lt;ref name="Caravan_needful"/&gt;
* An e-mail sent by Sunil Bajaj before the [[Diwali]] festival of 2013 suggested distributing gifts "to person in the middle and the lower ranks in various ministries, who are very vital in sustenance and procurement of important information and documents." The e-mail indicate that the Essar officials had access to confidential government communication from multiple ministries, including Coal, Environment, Finance, Petroleum, Railways, Shipping and Steel. The Essar officials were in close contact with the Petroleum Minister [[Veerappa Moily]], and had access to the 2012-13 budget proposals for his Ministry.&lt;ref name="Caravan_needful"/&gt;
* E-mail correspondence between Essar executives shows that BJP leader [[Nitin Gadkari]] and his family enjoyed a 2-night stay on an Essar luxury yacht in [[French Riviera]] during 7–9 July 2013. Essar also arranged their stay on the [[Sunrays (yacht)|Sunrays]] yacht for a day, including a helicopter trip to and from the [[Nice]] airport.&lt;ref name="IE_cruise"/&gt;
* Essar's internal records show that the company executives regularly arranged cabs for some Delhi-based journalists.&lt;ref name="IE_cruise"/&gt; These journalists included Anupama Airy (''Hindustan Times''), Meetu Jain (''[[CNN-IBN]]''), and Sandeep Bamzai (''Mail Today'').&lt;ref name="IE_journalists_resign"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://indianexpress.com/article/india/india-others/essar-leaks-2-journalists-resign-third-put-on-notice/ |title=Essar Leaks: 2 journalists resign, third put on notice |author=Archna Shukla |newspaper=Indian Express |date=28 February 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Reactions ==

=== Essar Group ===

In the 2015 affidavit seeking dismissial of CPIL's request for investigation, the Essar Group stated that they had not derived any benefits from the alleged favours. The affidavit stated that there was no evidence of any criminal offence by Essar Group, and the alleged favours "common courtesies extended by corporate houses".&lt;ref name="IE_courtesies"/&gt;

When ''[[The Caravan]]'' published a cover story critical of the company, the Essar group filed a {{INR}} 2500 million [[defamation]] suit against the magazine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.livemint.com/Companies/l7p8QtAzYYCRFzRHWVTZ0I/SC-declines-to-transfer-Essar-defamation-suit-against-Carav.html |title=SC declines to transfer Essar defamation suit against ‘Caravan’ to Delhi |author=Shreeja Sen |publisher=Live Mint |date=9 September 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Essar also questioned the authenticity of the leaked e-mails, calling them "unverified" and "pure hearsay". It stated that the company had not recruited people based solely on VIP recommendations, calling such recommendations legal and proper in Indian context.&lt;ref name="IE_courtesies"/&gt;

Essar accused CPIL of launching a smear campaign against them to seek publicity.&lt;ref name="IE_courtesies"/&gt;

=== People named in the leaks ===

BJP leader Nitin Gadkari denied extending any favours to the Essar Group, while commenting on his Essar-sponsored yacht stays. He stated that he was not a minister or the BJP President at the time, and paid for his family's Norway vacation using his own money. When Ruias (Essar owners) learned that he was visiting Europe, they invited him to their yacht as a family friend.&lt;ref name="IE_cruise"/&gt;

Sriprakash Jaiswal and Digvijaya Singh defended themselves stating they regularly make referrals to companies, to help unemployed people. Varun Gandhi stated that his office regularly gave letters of recommendations to educated unemployed youth after "satisfying their bonafide credentials."&lt;ref name="IE_cruise"/&gt;

Journalists Anupama Airy and Sandeep Bamzai resigned after being named among those for whom Essar had arranged cabs.&lt;ref name="IE_journalists_resign"/&gt; Airy stated that she had requested a cab from Essar "as help from a friend", and not as a journalist. She also expressed displeasure at being singled out, stating that other journalists at ''[[Hindustan Times]]'' had sought such help from businesses in the past.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.thenewsminute.com/socials/602 |title=Hindustan Times journalist who quit over Essar leaks questions senior editors about professional ethics |author=Dhanya Rajendran |publisher=The News Minute |date=2 March 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Bamzai denied publishing any biased news to favour Essar Group, and stated that asking them for a cab was simply "a stupid mistake". Meetu Jain had asked Essar for a cab in 2012, when she was working with CNN-IBN. At the time her name was released, she was working as a Deputy News Editor at [[Times Now]], which initiated an internal inquiry against her.&lt;ref name="IE_journalists_resign"/&gt;

Since 2010, the [[European Union]] has launched three separate [[antitrust]] investigations into [[Google]] for violating the [[European Union competition law|EU's competition laws]] due to its dominant position in the market. These cases have resulted in formal charges against Google related to [[Google Shopping]], [[Google AdSense]] and the [[Android (operating system)|Android operating system]]. To date, Google has been found guilty of antitrust behavior in the cases related to Google Shopping and Android, and have been fined over {{€|6 billion}}.

== Google Shopping charges ==
On 10 November 2010, the European Commission opened a formal investigation into Google's search algorithm, following a number of complaints issued by smaller web companies that Google was downgrading their placement in results returned in Google's search results, and that Google was preferentially favoring their own products over competitors. The EC's investigation also considered if there were issues with Google's terms of use for [[Google AdSense]] that prevented those using AdSense to not use advertising from Google's competitors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.nytimes.com/2010/12/01/technology/01google.html | title = Europe Opens Antitrust Inquiry Into Google | first1 = James | last1 = Kanter | first2 = Eric | last2 = Pfanner | date = 30 November 2010 | accessdate = 18 October 2018 | work = [[The New York Times]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 15 April 2015, five years into the investigation, the EC issued its first Statement of Objections towards Google related towards its preferential treatment of its [[Google Shopping]] product (including Google Product Search) in search results.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-32315649 | title = EU accuses Google Shopping of search 'abuse' | date =15 April 2015 | accessdate = 18 October 2018 | work = [[BBC]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The specific complaints issued by the EC included:&lt;ref&gt;[http://europa.eu/rapid/press-release_MEMO-15-4781_en.htm]&lt;/ref&gt;
* Google's search results predominate display Google Shopping results regardless of the merits of how well the Google Shopping results met the results of the search query.
* Google does not apply its system of penalties, a predefined set of parameters to lower the placement of shopping results, to its own Google Shopping results as it did to other competitors.
* Google had already attempted a shopping product, Froogle, but which it did not give any preferential treatment, and as a result, performed poorly. In contrast, Google Shopping was given favorable placement in Google's search result, allowing the service to achieve higher rates of growth.
* Google's favoring of Google Shopping thus had a negative impact on consumers and innovation.

=== Decision and impact ===
On 7 June 2017, Google was found guilty and was charged {{€|2.4 billion}} (about {{USD|2.7 billion}}), the largest such antitrust fine issued by the EC.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.cnet.com/news/google-buys-android/|title=Google buys Android|last=Olsen|first=Stefanie|date=8 October 2007|work=CNET|access-date=10 November 2017|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;Google has denied the European Union's accusations against them and made a statement claiming “its services had helped the region's digital economy grow”.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/06/27/technology/eu-google-fine.html|title=Google Fined Record $2.7 Billion in E.U. Antitrust Ruling|last=Scott|first=Mark|date=27 June 2017|work=The New York Times|access-date=10 November 2017|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}&lt;/ref&gt; The fine represented just over 2.5% of Google's 2016 revenue.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://money.cnn.com/2017/06/27/technology/business/google-eu-antitrust-fine/index.html|title=EU slaps Google with record $2.7 billion fine|first=Ivana|last=Kottasová|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Those who are in competition with Google are pushing for their company to be individually monitored, for fear of losing more business to the dominant search engine. This would include investigating and overviewing Google's most prized search page algorithm, [[PageRank]]. The EU's Competition Commission decided to monitor their decision and Google's compliance with it, due to its obligation to report to the EUCC on a regular basis (every four months). Although the issue seems like it is at a close, the European Commission believes it will continue for some time.

In order to comply, Google is effectively separating its comparison shopping service into its own company after the fine. The Google Shopping service still will be a part of Google, but will run completely separately with its own revenues and profits. This move will allow Google to avoid further fines, according to [[Bloomberg L.P.|Bloomberg]], as it complies with the European Union's order of allowing even treatment to businesses, no matter if they compete with Google or not.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/tech/2017/09/26/google-create-shopping-unit-appease-european-union-antitrust-regulators/706277001/|title=Google rolls out shopping ad changes to appease European Union antitrust regulators|last=Guynn|first=Jessica|date=26 September 2017|work=USA TODAY|access-date=10 November 2017|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, even though Google is complying in part, the company is still appealing the decision. Google responded in its appeal papers to the EU Antitrust Fine by stating that the EU chair misstated facts and didn’t show enough evidence to prove that their site hurt rivals. Google wants the fine either overturned or reduced. The appeal was based on six arguments, with two of them being that the court didn’t prove that Google favored its own shopping service by placing paid ads on top the search results. Two of them stated that the courts misstated facts and evidence, and the other two argued that a fine wasn’t warranted as a possible penalty.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/alphabets-google-responds-to-eu-antitrust-fine-1509388512|title=Alphabet’s Google Responds to EU Antitrust Fine|last=Drozdiak|first=Natalia|date=30 October 2017|work=Wall Street Journal|access-date=10 November 2017|language=en-US|issn=0099-9660}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Google AdSense charges ==
While investigating the case related to Google Shopping, the EC found additional evidence related to potential antitrust issues related to [[Google AdSense]], and issued a Statement of Complaints on 14 July 2016. These complaints were centered on how Google licensed AdSense to their direct partners:&lt;ref&gt;[http://europa.eu/rapid/press-release_IP-16-2532_en.htm]&lt;/ref&gt;
* Google required direct partners to exclusively to Google's AdSense and could not engage with Google's competitors;
* Google required that partners take a minimum number of Google ads and predominately place them above any other advertising, nor could place ads from other services above or alongside Google's ads;
* Google required partners get confirmation from Google before making any changes for how they displayed Google's competitors' ads.

This case, as of October 2018, still remains under investigation by the EC.

== Android and mobile apps charges ==
=== Prior complaints ===
The EC's actions to investigate Google's approach to the Android operating system was predicated on two complaints it had received. The first complain came from [[FairSearch]]. FairSearch was established in 2010 as a coalition of travel-related web companies including [[Expedia]] and [[TripAdvisor]] to try to fight against Google's proposed acquisition of [[ITA Software|ITA]], which had developed airfare search software.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Wasserman|first1=Elizabeth|title=DOJ threatens to nix Google merger|url=http://www.politico.com/news/stories/0211/50147.html|accessdate=30 December 2014|date=24 February 2011 | work = [[Politico]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; The group shifted towards becoming more of a Google watchdog group, looking at all instances of Google's activities which they considered were potentially anti-competition. Companies like [[Microsoft]], [[Nokia]], and [[Oracle]] joined the group to support this broader effort.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.theverge.com/2013/4/12/4216026/who-is-fairsearch | title=  What is FairSearch and why does it hate Google so much? | first =Vlad | last = Savov | date = 12 April 2013 | accessdate = 18 October 2018 | work = [[The Verge]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; Prior to their attention to the Android system, FairSearch issued complaints to the EC over how Google's search engines would preferentially weight results from Google's own services or its partners over others, as part of antitrust investigations conducted by the EU since 2010.&lt;ref name="fairsearch complaint"&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.theverge.com/2013/4/8/4203684/microsoft-others-file-eu-antitrust-complaint-over-android-bundling | title = Microsoft and others file EU antitrust complaint over Android app bundling | first =  Jeff | last = Blagdon | date = 8 April 2013 | accessdate = 18 October 2018 | work = [[The Verge]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; In April 2013, the European branch of FairSearch filed a formal complaint to the EU, who were still investigating Google from previous complaints, citing that Google's practices with Android violated various [[European Union competition law|EU's antitrust laws]]. The complaint identified that Google required any original equipment manufacturer (OEM) wanting to install Google's suite of Android apps, including access to the [[Google Play Store]], had to license the entire suite and feature them predominately on the mobile device.&lt;ref name="fairsearch complaint"/&gt; 

A second anti-trust complaint against Google was filed by [[Aptoide]] in June 2014, an alternative marketplace for Android apps. Aptoide asserted that Google's approach to Google made it difficult for alternatives to the Google Play store to be installed, and that some of the components that were once part of Google's Android Open Source Project were moved into the Google Mobile Services suite, including Gmail, Google Maps, and the Play Store.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.cnet.com/news/google-abusing-its-android-power-says-third-party-app-store-ceo/ | title = Google is abusing its Play power, says third-party Android app store CEO | first = Luke | last =Westaway | date = 17 June 2014 | accessdate = 18 October 2018 | work = [[CNet]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== EU's investigation ===
On 15 April 2015, the European Commission started an official investigation against Google following on the complaints filed by FairSearch and Apotoide and its own internal evaluation of these complaints over about a year. The EC stated that the company may have taken unlawful actions to maintain Google's [[Dominance (economics)|dominant position]] in the mobile market by how it licensed its suite of Android applications. The new investigation was announced alongside the EC's findings in its antitrust investigation into Google's search engine practices, but otherwise treated as a separate action against Google.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.nytimes.com/2015/04/16/business/international/european-union-google-antitrust-case.html | title = Europe Challenges Google, Seeing Violations of Its Antitrust Law | first1 = James | last1 = Kanter | first2 = Mark | last2 = Scott | date = 16 April 2015 | accessdate = 18 October 2018 | work =[[The New York Times]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Commission identified three points of concern in the first Statement of Objections:&lt;ref&gt;[http://europa.eu/rapid/press-release_MEMO-15-4782_en.htm Antitrust: Commission opens formal investigation against Google in relation to Android mobile operating system], ''europa.eu'' (15 April 2015).&lt;/ref&gt;

# Whether Google actions impede development of the market of mobile devices and access of competitors thereto by demanding or encouraging smart phone manufacturers to [[Pre-installed software|pre-install]] Google apps and services on their devices.
# Whether Google suppressed attempts of smart phone and tablet PC manufacturers willing to install Google apps on their devices to run on modified and potentially competitive versions of Android.
# Whether Google unlawfully impeded the market development by way of tacking the installation of certain Google apps with the use of other apps of this company or its software interface.

Google countered to this investigation that their practices with Android were no different with how [[Apple, Inc.]] or [[Microsoft]] bundles their own proprietary apps on their respective [[iOS]] and [[Windows Phone]], and that OEMs were still able to distribute Android-based phones without the Google suite of apps.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.fastcompany.com/3045132/read-googles-defensive-response-to-european-antitrust-charges | title = Read Google’s Defensive Response To European Antitrust Charges | first= David | last = Lumb | date = 16 April 2015 | accessdate = 18 October 2018 | work = [[Fast Company (magazine)|Fast Company]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the investigation, Google formed [[Alphabet Inc.]], a [[holding company]] for Google's various subsidiaries, with Google becoming one of Alphabet's subsidiaries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/google-creates-new-company-alphabet-1439240645 |title=Google Creates Parent Company Called Alphabet in Restructuring |last=Chen |first=Angela |date=10 August 2015 |publisher=Wall Street Journal |accessdate=10 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

A year after, on 20 April 2016, the European Commission announced the issue of the second Statement of Objections, now addressing both Google and Alphabet within its charges.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.nytimes.com/2016/04/21/technology/google-europe-antitrust.html | title=  E.U. Charges Dispute Google’s Claims That Android Is Open to All | first = Mark | last =Scott | date = 20 April 2016 | accessdate=  18 October 2018 | work = [[The New York Times]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; The new set of complaints, amending those of the first Statement of Objections, asserted Google violated EU's antitrust laws by:&lt;ref&gt;[http://europa.eu/rapid/press-release_IP-16-1492_en.htm Antitrust: Commission sends Statement of Objections to Google on Android operating system and applications], ''europa.eu'' (20 April 2016).&lt;/ref&gt;
* by requiring mobile manufacturers to pre-install Google Search and Google Chrome browser and requiring them to set Google Search as default search service on their devices, as a condition to license certain Google proprietary apps;
* by preventing manufacturers from selling smart mobile devices running on competing operating systems based on the Android [[Open-source software|open source code]];
* by giving financial incentives to manufacturers and mobile network operators on condition that they exclusively pre-install Google Search on their devices.

The potential fines for the case, if Google were to be found violating antitrust laws, has a maximum amount of 10% of the company's annual revenue, about {{USD|7.4 billion}} at the time of the issuing of the Second Statement of Objection.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/apr/20/eu-commission-google-android-skew-market-competition-antitrust-vestager/ | title = AEU accuses Google of using Android to skew market against rivals | work = [[The Guardian]] | date = 20 April 2016 | accessdate = 20 April 2016 | first = Jennifer | last= Rankin }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Decision and impact ===
On 19 July 2018, EU has fined Google {{€|4.3&amp;nbsp;billion}} (about {{USD|5 billion}}). Google responded it would appeal, according to company spokesperson Al Verney "Android has created more choice for everyone, not less". To date, this fine is the biggest ever imposed by European Union on a company for anti-competitive behaviour.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Google fined €4.3 billion by EU regulator |url=https://www.dw.com/en/google-fined-43-billion-by-eu-regulator/a-44719609 |website=[[Deutsche Welle]] |accessdate=28 July 2018 |language=en |date=18 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; European Union Competition Commissioner Margrethe Vestager, who was part of the decision against Google, stated that only after the EU found against Google in the search anti-trust case in 2017 did Google attempt to settle on the issues of the Android anti-trust issues, which was far too late after the EU filed the initial charges against Google.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-07-22/the-story-behind-google-s-secret-offer-to-settle-android-probe | title = The Story Behind Google's Secret Offer to Settle EU’s Android Probe | first1 =  Aoife  | last1 = White | first2=  Stephanie | last2  = Bodoni | date = 22 July 2018 | accessdate = 22 July 2018 | work = [[Bloomberg LP]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="13721">'''Firmographics''' (also known as '''''emporographics''''' or firm ''[[demographics]]'') are sets of characteristics to segment prospect [[organizations]].&lt;ref name="6 firmographics that help pinpoint prime selling opportunity"&gt;http://www.businessbrief.com/6-firmographics-that-help-pinpoint-prime-selling-opportunities&lt;/ref&gt;{{Dead link|date=December 2018}}

What demographics are to people, firmographics are to organizations. However, Webster (2005) suggested that the term "firmographics" is a combination of demographics and [[geographics]].

Commonly used firmographics include [[Standard Industrial Classification|SIC]], company size and location. The term "firmographics" is mostly used in relation to a first step of nested approach or [[Market segment|segment]]ation funnel, which was introduced by Shapiro and Bonoma in 1984.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://www.worldcat.org/title/business-to-business-marketing/oclc/656776045?referer=di&amp;ht=edition|title=Business-to-business marketing|last=Brennan|first=Ross|last2=Canning|first2=Louise|last3=McDowell|first3=Raymond|date=2010|publisher=SAGE|isbn=9781849201551|location=London|pages=386|language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Goals and purposes==

Firmographics variables allow firms to consider the features of [[organizational behavior]] in detail, for instance in a particular [[industry]]. It is helpful when there is no significant difference between operating variables, [[purchasing]] approach, situational factors and personal characteristics of customers.

Geodemographic segmentation is a logical starting point because  
#The data are obtainable through secondary sources, government agencies, or demographic [[vendor]]s; 
#It provides a quick snapshot of a market—an understanding of [[market structure]] and potential customer segments; and  
#Target populations can be sampled to represent characteristics of the entire market at a much lower cost than other forms of business segmentation.&lt;ref name="Art Weinstein. Handbook of market segmentation"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=sQXfAQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT79&amp;lpg=PT79&amp;dq=chapter+4+geographics+firmographics&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=zK7ZnZHtqR&amp;sig=d3Pqk1MOWaAACu-ZBbHSgy20IZM&amp;hl=ru&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=lLCuUq7RCZHV4QTR-ICYCg&amp;ved=0CCwQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=chapter%204%20geographics%20firmographics&amp;f=false|title=Handbook of Market Segmentation: Strategic Targeting for Business and Technology Firms, Third Edition|last=Weinstein|first=Art|date=2013-10-31|publisher=Routledge|isbn=9781135185664|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, Webster (2005) believed that this approach misses a set of essential variables. Moreover, a differentiation between segmentation bases of nested approach is too complicated.&lt;ref&gt;Уэбстер, Фредерик. Основы промышленного маркетинга/Фредерик Уэбстер.-М.Ж Издательский Дом Гребенникова, 2055. - 416 с.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Historical development==

The first attempts to segment industrial markets were made in 1934. J. Frederick described five factors that should be considered when defining a component market: industry, product use, company buying habits, channels of distribution, and geographic location.&lt;ref name="Balancing Theory and Practice: A Reappraisal of Business-to-Business Segmentation"&gt;{{cite journal | url = http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0019850198000029 | doi=10.1016/S0019-8501(98)00002-9 | volume=27 | title=Balancing Theory and Practice | journal=Industrial Marketing Management | pages=429–445}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term emporographics was coined by Banting in the early 1970s and refers to the equivalent of demographics in the context of industrial markets (Gross, A.C., Banting, P.M., Meredith, L.N., and Ford, I.D.: Business Marketing. Houghton Mifflin, Boston, MA, 1993).&lt;ref name="Balancing Theory and Practice: A Reappraisal of Business-to-Business Segmentation" /&gt; However, now the term “firmographics” is increasingly widely used.

[[Jerry Wind|Yoram Wind]] and Richard Cardozo  in 1974 advocate a two-stage approach to industrial segmentation that consists of macrosegments and microsegments. They explain that macrosegments consist of key organizational characteristics such as size of the buying firm, SIC category, geographic location, and usage factors, hence, mostly of firm demographics. In some cases, single-stage segmentation based primarily on business demographics is sufficient for identifying and targeting markets. More typical, however, is that a two-stage approach that will employ benefits and organizational [[psychographics]] and purchasing criteria will be needed to provide complete market profiles.&lt;ref name="Art Weinstein. Handbook of market segmentation" /&gt;

Firmographics play crucial role in one of the most significant developments in business segmentation theory came in 1984 with the work of Bonoma and Shapiro who were the first to propose a truly multistep basis for segmenting business markets. They proposed the use of five general segmentation criteria which they arranged in a nested hierarchy. The set of segmentation bases captures from macro-level to micro-level, and firmographics belong to the macro approach and comprise from industry, company size, customer location.&lt;ref name="Art Weinstein. Handbook of market segmentation" /&gt;

==Benefits and pitfalls==

It is not recommended to base segmentation solely on emporographics in the long term unless they reflect clear differences in needs, benefits, and product use. This is because the increasing competitive pressures observable in most organizational markets will, sooner or later, erode any industry structures not based on customer needs.&lt;ref name="Balancing Theory and Practice: A Reappraisal of Business-to-Business Segmentation" /&gt;

Firmographics may bear little direct relation to user needs or purchase requirements and benefits. Curran and Goodfellow suggest that descriptor-based approaches are popular, because they are convenient, clear cut, easy to implement, and they result in boundaries that are relatively stable over time.

Nevertheless, they add, such approaches are also arbitrary and usually are based largely on managerial judgment and intuition. It is easy for empirically oriented academics to underestimate the importance and value of managerial intuition, especially when this is based on experience. The attraction of descriptor-based or firmographic approaches is understandable in the circumstances and can provide useful and important insights to the practical issues of engaging with customers. More accurately, such emporographic variables facilitate such logistical issues of supplier convenience as minimizing sales or distribution costs and, perhaps, prices but this is not the principal reason for emporographic analysis.

But these approaches provide little understanding of underlying customer needs and so do not constitute a sufficient basis for segmentation in unfamiliar or competitively challenging markets. This point is demonstrated in product development processes where sophisticated segmentation will provide ample insight to evolving customer needs into the future, while emporographic approaches will struggle even to describe historic customer needs.&lt;ref name="Balancing Theory and Practice: A Reappraisal of Business-to-Business Segmentation" /&gt;

==Variables==

===Industry===

Industry firmographics refer to the activities of the [[firm]]. At a very high level, organizations can be classified into business and government segments. Most business activities are naturally constrained to certain industries due to their core competencies or the demands of the customers. Only a few business activities are not. Therefore, industry type becomes a natural market segmentation variable for businesses. Government organizations can be segmented by their federal, state, county, regional, city, and municipality status.&lt;ref name="The Most Important Word Missing From Your Go-To-Market Strategy"&gt;http://www.wiglafjournal.com/marketing/2013/01/what-are-firmographics&lt;/ref&gt; The dominant business segmentation variables are those associated with an [[NAICS]] or [[Standard Industrial Classification|SIC]] code. NAICS refers to the North American Industry Classification System adapted by the [[United States Census Bureau|U.S. Census bureau]] in 1997. SIC refers to the older Standard Industrial Classification system that was established in 1937. Either NAICS or SIC can be used to identify firms by industry.  While most businesses use the newer NAICS, many still work with the older SIC and both systems can be used with most modern business research reports and tools.

===Location===
Location firmographics refers to where the business is located. As a segmentation variable, firms may be aggregated by city, metropolitan statistical area, state, region, country, or continent.  Alternatively, firms may be targeted according to their distance from a central location, usually the location of the firm conducting the sales and marketing effort. Most business activities are naturally constrained to certain regions due to competitive pressures, legal restrictions, and cost constraints. Only a few business activities are not.  As such, location becomes a natural market segmentation variable for businesses. The nature of the industry plays a role if the location is of big importance. Businesses in a certain industry can therefore be compared with each other on location.&lt;ref name="The Most Important Word Missing From Your Go-To-Market Strategy" /&gt;

===Customer size===

Customer size in Firmographics refers to the size of clients the company has. This can range from small- to mid-size companies or Fortune 500 clients. (Korten, 2012) The size of customers companies aim for may distinguish one company from another. The basis for measuring the different size of customers is depending on which product or service is being purchased. For example, you have customers that purchase high volume because of low-priced product or customers that purchase low volume because of high-priced product.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

===Status and structure===

Status and structure firmographics can refer to the relation of one organization to another, or it can refer to the legal status of an organization. For instance, individual establishments (also known as firms by the above definition) may be categorized as being independent businesses, part of a larger parent company, or the headquarters of a parent company.  Similarly, firms may be categorized as being a stand-alone entity, a franchisee of a franchising organization, a subsidiary of a larger organization, or the outlet of a larger organization. Alternatively, firms may be categorized as being a sole proprietorship, limited liability corporation, limited liability partnership, private corporation, or public shareholder-owned corporation. Other variables describing the status or structure of an organization are used as well.

===Performance===

Performance firmographics refer to the characteristics of a firm related to its business execution over time. The duration of a firm’s existence, rate of growth or decline, profits and losses, and changes in profits and losses can all be indicators of the likelihood of a firm to need a business product or service.  Firms in the same industry of relatively similar size but undergoing different rates of growth or decline are likely to have very different demands for business services.  As such, they can form meaningful segmentation variables.&lt;ref name="The Most Important Word Missing From Your Go-To-Market Strategy" /&gt; Companies carrying put segmentation of their customers choose performance metrics based on the information they would like to acquire. That is why there may be no performance variable, but a group of variables that can be referred to as «performance», such as:
#Annual revenue: There’s usually a clear correlation between how significant a company’s annual earnings are, and whether a buyer would have money in the budget to afford doing business with a company.
#Executive title: Which titles are proven most likely to need your products and/or services?
#Average sales cycle: How long does the average sale take to close? What is the official dividing line between prospects who want to make a well-informed buying decision and those who have no real intention of buying.

== Dynamics ==
Gains from trade are commonly described as resulting from:

* trade  through [[markets]] from sale of one type of output for other, more highly valued goods.&lt;ref&gt;Paul A. Samuelson and William D. Nordhaus, 2004. ''[[Economics (textbook)|Economics]]'', McGraw-Hill, ch. 2, "Trade, Specialization, and Division of Labor" section.&lt;/ref&gt;
 
Market incentives, such as reflected in [[price]]s of outputs and inputs, are theorized to attract [[factors of production]], including labor,  into activities according to [[comparative advantage]], that is,  for which they each have a low [[opportunity cost]]. The factor owners then use their increased income from such specialization to buy more-valued [[good (economics)|goods]] of which they would otherwise be high-cost producers, hence their ''gains from trade''.  The concept may be applied to an entire economy for the alternatives of [[autarky]] (no trade) or trade.  A measure of total gains from trade is the sum of [[consumer surplus]] and producer [[Profit (economics)|profits]] or,  more roughly, the increased output from specialization in production with resulting trade.&lt;ref&gt;Paul A. Samuelson and William D. Nordhaus, 2004. ''Economics'', ch. 12, 15, "Comparative Advantage among Nations" section," "Glossary of Terms," Gains from trade.&lt;/ref&gt;  Gains from trade may also refer to net benefits to a country from lowering barriers to trade such as [[tariffs]] on [[import]]s.&lt;ref&gt;[[Alan Deardorff|Alan V. Deardorff]], ''Glossary of International Economics]'', 2006. [http://www-personal.umich.edu/~alandear/glossary/g.html#GainsFromTrade "Gains from trade."]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[David Ricardo]] in 1817 first clearly stated and proved the principle of comparative advantage,&lt;ref&gt;David Ricardo, 1817.  ''On the Principles of Political Economy and Taxation''.&lt;/ref&gt;  termed a "fundamental analytical explanation" for the source of gains from trade.&lt;ref&gt;[[Ronald Findlay]], 2008. "comparative advantage,"  ''The New Palgrave Dictionary of Economics'', 2nd Edition, 1st paragraph. [http://www.dictionaryofeconomics.com/article?id=pde2008_C000254&amp;edition=current&amp;q=comparative%20advantage&amp;topicid=&amp;result_number=1 Abstract].&lt;/ref&gt; But from publication of [[Adam Smith]]'s ''[[The Wealth of Nations]]'' in 1776, it was  widely argued, that, with competition and absent market [[distortions (economics)|distortions]],  such gains are positive in moving toward [[free trade]] and away from autarky or prohibitively high import [[tariffs]].  Rigorous early contemporary statements of the conditions under which this proposition holds are found in Samuelson in 1939 and 1962.&lt;ref&gt;• Paul A. Samuelson, 1939. "The Gains from International Trade," ''Canadian Journal of Economics and Political Science'' 5(2), p [https://www.jstor.org/stable/137133 p. 195]-205.

"The Gains from International Trade Once Again," ''Economic Journal'', 72(288), pp. [http://stevereads.com/papers_to_read/the_gains_from_international_trade_once_again.pdf 820-829.]&lt;br/&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; • Alan V.

Kemp and Henry Y. Wan, Jr., 1972. "The Gains from Free Trade," ''International Economic Review'', 13(3), pp. [https://www.jstor.org/pss/2525840 509]-522.&lt;/ref&gt;

It does not follow that no tariffs are the best an economy could do.  Rather, a large economy might be able to set taxes and subsidies to its benefit at the expense of other economies.  Later results of Kemp and others showed that in an Arrow-Debreu world with a system of [[lump sum tax|lump-sum]] compensatory mechanisms, corresponding to a [[customs union]] for a given subset set of countries (described by free trade among a group of economies and a common set of tariffs), there is a common set of ''world''' tariffs such that no country would be worse off than in the smaller customs union. The suggestion is that if a customs union has advantages for an economy, there is a worldwide customs union that is at least as good for each country in the world.&lt;ref&gt;• Murray C. Kemp 1987.

==Measurement==

[[Classical economist]]s maintain that there are two methods to measure the gains from trade: 1) [[international trade]] increases [[national income]] which helps us to get low priced imports; 2) gains are measured in [[terms of trade]]. To measure the gains from the trade, comparison of a country's [[cost of production]] with a foreign country's cost of production for the same product is required. However, it is very difficult to acquire the knowledge of cost of production and cost of imports in a domestic country. Therefore, terms of trade method is preferable to measure the gains from trade.

==Factors affecting gains from trade==

There are several factors which determine the gains from international trade:

# Differences in cost ratio: The gains from international trade depends upon the cost ratios of differences in comparative cost ratios in the two trading countries. The smaller the difference between exchange rate and cost of production the smaller the gains from trade and vice versa.
# Demand and supply: If a country has elastic demand and supply gains the gains from trade are higher than if demand and supply are inelastic.
# Factor availability: International trade is based on the specialization and a country specializes depending upon the availability of factors of production. It will increase the domestic cost ratios and thereby the gains from trade.
# Size of country: If a country is small in size it is relatively easy for them to specialize in the production of one commodity and export the surplus production to a large country and can get more gains from international trade. Whereas if a country is large in size then they have to specialize in more than one good because the excess production of only one commodity can not be exported fully to a small sized country as the demand for good will reduce very frequently. So the smaller the size of the country, the larger the gain from trade.
# Terms of Trade: Gains from trade will depend upon the terms of trade. If the cost ratio and terms of trade are closer to each other more will be the gains from trade of the participating countries.
# Productive Efficiency: An increase in the productive efficiency of a country also determines its gains from trade as it lowers the cost of production and price of the goods. As a result, the country importing  gains by importing cheap goods.

==Static and dynamic gains from trade==

The gains from trade can be clad into static and dynamic gains from trades. Static Gains means the increase in social welfare as a result of maximized national output due to optimum utilization of country's factor endowments or resources. Dynamic gains from trade, are those benefits which accelerate economic growth of the participating countries.

[[Static gains]] are the result of the operation of the theory of comparative cost in the field of foreign trade. On this principle countries make the [[optimum use]] of their [[available resources]] so that their national output is greater which also raises the level of social welfare in the country. When there is an introduction of foreign trade in the economy the result is called the static gains from trade.

[[Dynamic gains]] from trade relate to economic development of the economy. Specialization of the country for the production of best suited commodities which result in a large volume of quality production which promotes growth. Thus the extension of domestic market to foreign market will accelerate economic growth.

'''Gian Visser''' (born 1975) is a South African entrepreneur and innovator in the internet services sector of South Africa. Visser is the current CEO and co-founder of [[Afrihost]] and has won several awards for his work in the IT sector. &lt;ref&gt;[https://techcentral.co.za/qa-with-afrihost-ceo-gian-visser/13551/ "QA with Afrihost CEO Gian Visser"], Tech Central, 6 August 2013&lt;/ref&gt;



==Early life==

Visser was born in [[Johannesburg]], Gauteng on 27 February 1975. His parents were born and met in Carltonville, from mining families. His father was a police officer in the [[South African Police Service]] and his mother was a bookkeeper. He also has a younger sister.

Visser's family moved to [[Johannesburg]], where he attended school at [[King Edward VII School (Johannesburg)]] in [[Houghton Estate]], along side his future business partners, [[Brendan Armstrong]] and Peter Meintjies.

Visser registered to study [[Actuarial Science]] at [[University of the Witwatersrand]] but later changed to complete a BCom &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.itweb.co.za/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=141088 "Gian Visser - Shake, rattle &amp; roll"], ITWeb, 12 February 2015&lt;/ref&gt;. After completing his studies, he worked briefly as a maths teacher before deciding to devote his time to entrepreneurship.

==Business career==

Visser began a number of small businesses while still studying. His first full-time business pursuit was in the IT sector, alongside his long time friend, Brendan Armstrong. They formed a company called VSphereNet (or VSN), which was later bought by a larger IT firm. Visser and Armstrong were appointed as Directors of the company, but later chose to leave to follow independent business ventures.

Visser and Armstrong, along with schoolfriend Peter Meintjies, formed [[Afrihost]] in September 2000. The company started in his mother's home (in his bedroom) and gradually began to grow to the point where the company's operations took over the entire house.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="25234">A '''knock-down kit''' is a kit containing the parts needed to assemble a product. The parts are typically manufactured in one country or region, then [[export]]ed to another country or region for final assembly. Variant names include '''knockdown kit''', '''knocked-down kit''', or simply '''knockdown''', and the abbreviated '''KD''' or '''CKD'''.

A common form of knock-down is a '''complete knock-down''' ('''CKD'''), which is a kit of the completely non-assembled parts of a product. It is also a method of supplying parts to a market, particularly in shipping to foreign nations, and serves as a way of counting or pricing.&lt;ref name=Miller&gt;{{cite book |last=Miller | first=Russell R. |title=Doing business in newly privatized markets: global opportunities and challenges |publisher=Greenwood Publishing Group |year=2000 | page=281 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=p9SVncxZNLYC&amp;pg=PA281&amp;dq=Basic+Knock+Down+Kit&amp;q |isbn=978-1-56720-260-1 |accessdate=2010-06-08 }}&lt;/ref&gt; CKD is a common practice in the [[automotive industry|automotive]], [[bus]], heavy [[truck]] and [[rail transport|rail vehicle]] industries, as well as electronics, furniture and other products. Businesses sell knocked-down kits to their foreign affiliates or licensees for various reasons, including the avoidance of import taxes, to receive tax preferences for providing local manufacturing jobs, or even to be considered as a bidder at all (for example, in [[public transport]] projects with "buy national" rules).

A '''semi-knocked-down kit''' ('''SKD''') is a kit of the partially assembled parts of a product. It is also called an '''incompletely disassembled kit''', although it has never been assembled. Both types of KDs, complete and incomplete, are collectively referred to within the auto industry as '''KDX''' (for '''knocked-down export'''), and cars assembled in the country of origin and exported whole to the destination market are known as '''BUX''' (for '''built-up export''').

Technically, the terms "knock-down", "incompletely disassembled kit" and "kits of parts" are all [[misnomer]]s, because the knock-downs were never built up in the first place, and the shipments of parts are often not in the form of kits,&lt;ref name=Miller/&gt; but rather bulk-packed by type of part into [[shipping container]]s. The degree of "knock-down" depends on the desires and technical abilities of the receiving organization, or on government import regulations.&lt;ref name=Miller/&gt; Developing nations may pursue trade and economic policies that call for [[import substitution]] or local content regulations.  Companies with CKD operations help the country substitute the finished products it imports with locally assembled substitutes.

Knock-down kit assembling plants are less expensive to establish and maintain, because they do not need modern robotic equipment, and the workforce is usually much less expensive in comparison to the home country. The plants may also be effective for low-volume production. The CKD concept allows firms in developing markets to gain expertise in a particular industry. At the same time, the CKD kit exporting company gains new markets that would otherwise be closed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Lind |first=Tommy |url=http://www.tlind.dk/eng-rhistory_louis.htm |title=Partnerships - a solution |publisher=Tommy Lind's History of Renault 1898-1975 |accessdate=2010-06-08 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Automotive==
In the automotive industry, the most basic form of a vehicle in KD kit lacks the wheels, [[internal combustion engine]], [[transmission (mechanics)|transmission]], and [[battery (electricity)|battery]].{{citation needed|date=August 2009}} They are either supplied as ''parts'' for assembly (a "complete" kit), or obtained from third parties (an "incomplete" kit); all of the interiors are already installed at the originating factory. The term SKD for semi-knocked-down refers to a kit with a complete, welded car body, usually coated or already painted. To gain some extra tax preferences, the manufacturer needs to further ''localise'' the car, i.e. increase the share of parts produced by local manufacturers, such as tires, wheels, seats, headlights, windscreens and glass, batteries, interior plastics, etc., even down to the engine and transmission.  At some point, the steel body could be pressed, welded, and painted locally, which effectively makes KD assembly only a couple of steps away from full-scale production.

By the time that [[Henry Ford]] co-wrote his 1922 memoir ''My Life and Work'', the Ford Motor Company was already shipping car parts from its Michigan plants for final assembly in the regions of the United States or foreign countries where the cars would be sold.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Ford |first=Henry |last2=Crowther |first2=Samuel | year=1922 |title=My Life and Work |publisher=Garden City Publishing |pages=81, 167 |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=4K82efXzn10C&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=Ford+1922+%22My+Life+and+Work%22 |access-date=2010-06-08 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

During World War II, a great number of U.S. and Canadian-built vehicles&amp;nbsp;— most notably light and heavy trucks like Willys MB/Ford GPW/GPA, GMC-353/CCKW and vehicles from the [[Canadian Military Pattern truck|CMP family]]&amp;nbsp;— were crated and shipped overseas in KD form, in various degrees of completeness, to Allied countries, in order to sustain their war effort. Assembly lines were preferably set up in local automotive factories where appropriate tooling and equipment could be easily found but, where needed, other types of buildings could be used, especially in on-the-field situations, and on occasion even open-air rebuilding camps were set up, managed by military personnel. Owing to male mobilization, sometimes a female workforce was employed. CKD military vehicles could be stored for shipment in one-vehicle-per-crate form (or SUP, Single Unit Pack), or as several vehicles (usually two to three) divided in two or more crates. Vehicles shipped to certain countries could be lacking some items, such as cabs, beds or tires, that were built and provided locally.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=CMP Assembly Overseas|journal=Wheels &amp; Tracks |issue=37}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite AV media| url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hhf4ynHqVqA&amp;feature=related|title=148th MVA Ordnance - WWII - Dad in France on Assembly Line}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Mahindra &amp; Mahindra Limited]] in [[India]] began its business in 1947 with assembling CKD [[Jeep]]s.  Mahindra expanded their operations to include domestic manufacture of Jeep vehicles with a high level of local content [[Licence-built|under license]] from [[Kaiser Jeep Corporation]] and later [[American Motors]] (AMC).

In the 1950s and 1960s [[Lotus Cars]] sold its [[Lotus Seven]] car in CKD form to avoid the UK [[purchase tax]] that applied to sales of fully assembled vehicles.

By 1959, and with the introduction of the [[Mini]], the products of [[British Motor Corporation|BMC]] were still either imported or assembled from CKD kits in several international markets.

In 1961, [[Renault]] began negotiations for a first partnership agreement with AMC for assembly of [[Rambler (automobile)|Rambler]] automobiles in [[Europe]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Lind |first=Tommy |url=http://www.tlind.dk/eng-rhistory_louis.htm  |title=International agreements... |publisher=Tommy Lind's History of Renault 1898-1975 |access-date=2010-06-08 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Beginning in 1962, and continuing until 1967, AMC also sold CKD kits of its passenger cars to Renault.  They were assembled in Renault's factory in [[Haren, Belgium]] and sold through its dealers in [[Algeria]], [[Austria]], [[Belgium]], [[France]], the [[Netherlands]], and [[Luxembourg]].  The deal allowed AMC to sell its cars in new markets without having to make a major [[Foreign direct investment|Foreign Direct Investment]] (FDI).  The arrangement was good for the French automaker because its product range was lacking large cars and it needed to offer an "executive" model in its European markets.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://club.doctissimo.fr/phedor/blog/cimetiere-oubliees-rambler-2264660.html |title=Le cimetière des autos oubliées: Renault Rambler (1962-67) |publisher=The graveyard of forgotten cars |language=French |date=2007-04-04 |access-date=2010-06-08 |journal= |archive-url=https://www.webcitation.org/69tfaWqwX?url=http://blog.doctissimo.fr/phedor/cimetiere-oubliees-rambler-2264660.html |archive-date=2012-08-13 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The situation had changed by 1977. It was now AMC that sought outside support for a new car in the United States [[subcompact car|sub-compact]] market segment, which led to the first of many agreements with Renault.

Volvo's [[Volvo Halifax Assembly|Halifax Assembly Plant]], which opened 1963, completed vehicles in CKD form from Sweden for North American consumers. Halifax Assembly closed in December 1998.

In 1967, [[Rootes Group]] UK began exporting CKD [[Rootes Arrow|Hillman Hunters]] to Iran where they were sold as the [[Paykan]] (meaning "arrow" in [[Persian language|Persian]]). Bought by Chrysler in 1967 and then part of the sale to the [[PSA Group]] by the [[Chrysler Corporation]] of its European operations in late 1978, the Rootes business basis in Iran became the primer for the very significant PSA Peugeot Citroën business in Iran involving engine and CKD deliveries, particularly from the 405, introduced in 1990 and facelifted as the Pars in 1999 and 206 introduced in 2001.&lt;ref&gt;Paul, Peugeot Pars: petite histoire de la 405 iranienne !, uploaded on 15 Sept. 2015, con sulted on 17 Febr. 2017 [http://boitierrouge.com/2015/09/05/peugeot-pars-petite-histoire-de-la-405-iranienne/]&lt;/ref&gt; In 2004, Peugeot's partner [[Iran Khodro]] produced 281'000 Peugeot vehicles, securing a 36% market share.

In 1967 as well, [[Peugeot]] introduced CKD-based production of a light pick-up vehicle based on the [[Peugeot 403]] in Peugeot's Berazategui factory (in [[Buenos Aires]]) under the name Peugeot 4TB.&lt;ref&gt;Mauricio Uldane, La primera camioneta de SAFRAR, article containing many additional links, consulted on 17 Febr. 2017 [https://www.taringa.net/post/autos-motos/18473438/La-primera-camioneta-de-SAFRAR.html]&lt;/ref&gt; In 1973, this model was replaced by the [[Peugeot 404|404 pick-up]] and later (1990) by the [[Peugeot 504|504 pick-up]]. The 404 and 504 were massively marketed worldwide through local CKD assembly shops: the 404 was assembled, besides France and Argentina, in Australia, Belgium, Canada (at the SOMA plant shared with Renault), Chile, Ireland, Kenya, Madagascar, Malaysia, New Zealand, Nigeria, Portugal, Perú, Rhodesia, South Africa and Uruguay;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | title = World Cars 1972 | ref = WC72 | publisher = L'Editrice dell'Automobile LEA/Herald Books | location = Bronxville, NY | page = 402 | year = 1972 | isbn = 0-910714-04-5 }}&lt;/ref&gt; the 504, mainly in Argentina, Egypt, Nigeria, Kenya, South-Africa, Australia and China by the [[Guangzhou Peugeot Automobile Company]] which developed a specific crew cab version.

In 1968, the independent German automotive firm, [[Karmann]], began assembly of CKD kits of AMC's newly introduced [[AMC Javelin|Javelin]] for distribution in Europe.  American Motors also provided [[right hand drive]] versions of their automobiles to markets such as [[Australia]], [[New Zealand]], and [[South Africa]]. The components were shipped in containers to Australia from AMC's plants in [[Kenosha, Wisconsin]], or [[Brampton, Ontario]]. Assembly of Rambler and AMC vehicles in Australia was done by [[Australian Motor Industries]] (AMI) in [[Port Melbourne, Victoria]]. Local content requirements were met by using Australian suppliers for the interiors (seats, carpeting, etc.) as well as for lights, heaters, and other components.  Various Rambler models were assembled in New Zealand from the early 1960s until 1971 by Campbell Motors in [[Thames, New Zealand#Business|Thames]] (later [[Toyota New Zealand]]), which had also built Toyota, Datsun, Hino, Renault, and Peugeot cars.

New Zealand had developed a car assembly industry &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Webster|first=Mark|year=2002|title=Assembly: New Zealand car production 1921-98 |publisher=Reed Books |location=New Zealand |pages=1–223 |isbn=0-7900-0846-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; as a means of [[import substitution]] and providing local employment, despite the small size of the local market.   Following economic reforms in the 1980s, including the lowering of import tariffs, the ability to import Australian-built vehicles duty-free under the [[Closer Economic Relations|CER]] agreement, many car companies ended assembly in New Zealand and switched to importing completely built up vehicles from [[Japan]], [[Australia]], or [[Europe]].  More significantly, the easing of import restrictions led to a large number of Japanese [[grey import vehicles|used imports]], which were far cheaper than locally assembled used cars, and continue to outnumber so-called 'NZ New' vehicles. The last companies to assemble CKD kits in New Zealand were [[Toyota]], [[Nissan]], [[Mitsubishi Motors|Mitsubishi]], and [[Honda]], which closed their plants in 1998, when the government announced plans to abolish import tariffs on cars.

More recent examples include [[Ukraine]], which has almost prohibitive import taxes on finished cars. [[ZAZ|AutoZAZ]] assembles CKD kits of some [[Lada]], [[Opel]], [[Mercedes-Benz]], and [[GM Daewoo|Daewoo]] cars.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aval.ua/eng/press/partners/?id=35008 "ZAZ increased car output by 7% in Q1 2006" Bank AVAL], retrieved on: 3 September 2007. {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070711205613/http://www.aval.ua/eng/press/partners/?id=35008 |date=July 11, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  It went as far as adopting a version of [[Daewoo Lanos]] for full-scale production and equipping it with a domestic engine.  The German [[automotive industry|automotive]] giant - [[Volkswagen Group]] also produces SKDs in the Ukraine at its [[Solomonovo]] plant, producing cars under its [[Škoda Auto|Škoda]] and [[Volkswagen|Volkswagen Passenger Cars]] [[marque]]s.

In [[Russia]], the most well-known KD assembling facilities are owned by [[Avtotor]],{{citation needed|date=August 2009}} which produces [[Hummer H2]], [[BMW 3 Series]] and [[BMW 5 Series]] in [[Kaliningrad]], and [[Renault Logan]] in [[Moscow]] using facilities that once belonged to [[AZLK]].  In [[Kaluga]], Volkswagen Group is currently constructing a new plant, which when completed, is expected to have an annual output of 150,000 units.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release|title=The Volkswagen Plant in Kaluga |publisher=Volkswagen-Media-Services.com |date=28 February 2009 |url=https://www.volkswagen-media-services.com/medias_publish/ms/content/en/pressemitteilungen/2009/02/28/the_volkswagen_plant.standard.gid-oeffentlichkeit.html |access-date=2009-08-22 }}{{dead link|date=June 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Daimler AG]] has a CKD assembly plant in [[South Carolina]] that re-assembles [[Mercedes-Benz Sprinter]] vans for sale in the United States and Canada at [[Mercedes-Benz]] and [[Freightliner Trucks|Freightliner]] dealers, along with [[Dodge]] dealers prior to [[Fiat Group]]'s takeover of [[Chrysler Group LLC]] &amp;mdash; essentially to circumvent the 25% tariff on imported light trucks known as the "[[Chicken Tax]]". The Sprinter was eventually replaced in the Dodge/[[Ram Trucks|Ram]] lineup with the similar Ram ProMaster, a rebadged [[Fiat Ducato]]. Unlike the CKD Dodge Sprinter, the ProMaster is fully imported to the U.S. from a Chrysler plant in [[Mexico]], which is part of the [[North American Free Trade Agreement]] and not subject to the Chicken Tax.

In 2009, [[Mahindra &amp; Mahindra Limited]] announced that it would export pickup trucks powered by [[diesel engine]]s from India to the United States in knockdown kit (CKD) form, again to circumvent the [[chicken tax]].&lt;ref name="mtrend"&gt;{{cite journal|title=Mahindra Planning Kit Assembly of Diesel Pickups To Avoid Chicken Tax |journal=Motor Trend |first=Benson |last=Kong |date=June 2009 |url= http://www.trucktrend.com/features/news/2009/163_news090601_mahindra_planning_kit_assembly_of_diesel_pickups_to_avoid_chicken_tax/index.html |access-date=23 November 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Mahindra planned to export CKDs to the United States as complete vehicles that will be assembled in the United States from kits of parts shipped in crates.&lt;ref name="mtrend"/&gt; However, Mahindra's United States CKD and export plans never materialized and were subject to several lawsuits.

Since 2013 [[Tesla, Inc.|Tesla]] operates an assembly plant in [[Tilburg]], [[Netherlands]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.tesla.com/blog/tesla-motors-opens-assembly-plant-tilburg-netherlands|title=Tesla Motors Opens Assembly Plant in Tilburg, Netherlands|website=www.tesla.com|access-date=2017-09-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is used for the assembly of their fully electric [[Tesla Model S|Model S]] sedan and [[Tesla Model X|Model X]] SUV for the [[European Union]], but not all of Europe since only cars imported to the EU benefit from circumventing the 10% import duty&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.carfax.eu/article/customs-clearance-and-import-tax-usa.html|title=Customs clearance &amp; import tax US cars|website=www.carfax.eu|access-date=2017-09-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; (e.g. cars to Norway are shipped directly from the United States). For the most part the car is still manufactured in the [[Tesla Factory]] in [[Fremont, California]]. During the final assembly in the Netherlands various parts are added to the car most notably the rear subframe with the drive train as well as the battery pack.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://gopressmobility.be/2017/02/07/tesla-assembly-pant-tilburg-full-capacity/|title=Tesla assembly plant in Tilburg at full capacity|date=2017-02-07|website=GoPress Mobility|access-date=2017-09-08}}{{Dead link|date=September 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Buses==

*[[Motor Coach Industries]] opened its [[Pembina, North Dakota]], assembly plant in 1963, as part of an expansion into the U.S. market. Unfinished KD (knocked down) coach bodies are shipped from [[Winnipeg, Manitoba]], by flatbed trailer and completed, outfitted and delivered at Pembina. This practice simplifies [[U.S. Customs]] and meets the "[[Buy America Act]]" provisions (49 USC 5323(j) and 49 CFR Part 661) for public agencies purchasing new equipment with federal funds.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.busmag.com/mci-celebrates-80-years-bus-production "MCI Celebrates 80 Years of Bus Production", National Bus Trader, June 2013].&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[North American Bus Industries]] opened operations in [[Anniston, Alabama]], in 1993, with incomplete buses shipped from [[Budapest]], [[Hungary]], to Anniston for final assembly. NABI expanded production operations in Anniston to allow full production with its first fully domestically produced bus unit in 2008.

==Rail==
*The practice of selling "knocked down" railcars, called by that name, pre-dates the 20th century, as evidenced by an advertisement by [[J. G. Brill and Company]] in the ''Street Railway Journal'' from 1898.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Brill |first=Debra |year=2001 |title=History of the J.G. Brill Company |publisher=Indiana University Press |pages=56–57 |isbn=978-0-253-33949-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Many rail equipment builders have used kits or incomplete vehicles, often to meet local assembly and production requirements or quotas, or to satisfy tariffs. Some examples include:
**Between 1938 and 1951, the [[St. Louis Car Company]] shipped [[PCC streetcar]] body shells and trucks north for assembly by [[Canadian Car &amp; Foundry]]. The [[Toronto Transit Commission]] (TTC) [[Presidents' Conference Committee (Toronto streetcar)|PCC fleet]] was purchased and delivered in this method.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.streetcar.org/streetcars/1074 Market Street Railway: "Historic Streetcars: Car 1074" Market Street Railway, San Francisco].&lt;/ref&gt;
**[[Bombardier Transportation|Bombardier]] ships incomplete cars from its plant at [[La Pocatière, Quebec]], to [[Plattsburgh, New York]], and (until 2002) [[Barre, Vermont (city)|Barre, Vermont]], facilities for final assembly. These are to meet "Buy America Act" provisions for U.S. public transit agencies and tariff rules. Since 2009 the Plattsburgh assembly plant has full stainless steel welding and fabrication capability, allowing for cars to be fully assembled and completed on site.
**[[Kawasaki Heavy Industries Rolling Stock Company|Kawasaki Heavy Industries]] (KHI) has an assembly plant in [[Yonkers, New York]], that completes final assembly of cars using bodies shipped from [[Kobe, Japan]]. KHI also has a car body plant in [[Lincoln, Nebraska]], full cars are built there and can be shipped to Yonkers for completion.
**[[Alstom]]'s [[Hornell, New York]], assembly plant produces final completed cars using stainless body assemblies shipped from the Lapa plant in [[Sao Paulo]], [[Brazil]]. The same production method was used by [[Morrison Knudsen]] when it built new passenger cars at the Hornell shops in the 1990s.
**From their first U.S. order from the [[South Shore Line (NICTD)|South Shore Line]] in 1982 until the opening of a full body manufacturing and assembly line in [[Rochelle, Illinois]] thirty years later,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.n-sharyo.co.jp/topics_e/tp130430.htm "Expansion of Rochelle Production Facility", Nippon Sharyo USA, Inc, 30 April 2013].&lt;/ref&gt; [[Nippon Sharyo]] sent commuter train bodies from Japan to U.S. finishers, including an American unit of [[Sumitomo]].
**[[Hyundai Rotem]] opened an assembly facility in [[South Philadelphia]], located in an industrial park off [[Columbus Boulevard (Philadelphia)|Columbus Boulevard]]. Car shells are assembled, outfitted and completed for delivery at this site, which is served by [[Conrail Shared Assets|Conrail]] on the [[Philadelphia Belt Line Railroad|Philadelphia Belt Line]], allowing delivery of new cars by rail.
**The [[London Underground]] [[London Underground 1995 Stock|1995]] and [[London Underground 1996 Stock|1996 Stock]] fleets have aluminium bodies built by [[Alstom]] in [[Barcelona]] with assembly completed at the [[Metro-Cammell]] works in [[Washwood Heath]], [[Birmingham]].

==Aircraft==
Unserviceable military [[aircraft]] are also sold as "knock-downs" after they have ended their [[service life]], packaging them with serviceable aircraft.  This allows them to be used for [[Cannibalization of machine parts|cannibalization]] of [[spare part]]s.

The European aircraft manufacturer [[Airbus]] uses knock-down kits to assemble [[Airbus A320 family|A320 family]] aircraft outside Europe. The Airbus A320 final assembly line in [[Tianjin]], [[China]] assembles fuselage, wing, and tail sections made in Europe with [[avionics]] and [[jet engine|engines]] made in [[European Union|Europe]] or the [[United States]] and locally sourced components for interiors. Airbus has opened a similar A320 final assembly line in the United States in September 2015, located in [[Mobile, Alabama]]; again using European-made fuselages, wings, and tail sections. However, the Mobile final assembly line will use more locally sourced components than the Tianjin line; engines, interior components, and avionics will be sourced mainly from American suppliers.{{Citation needed|date=November 2015}} Both the Airbus Tianjin and Mobile plants receive their fuselages, wings, and tail sections from Europe via [[Ship transport|ocean freight]] using specially designed [[ship]]s, as the plants are located in [[port]] cities.

==Housing==
{{main|Kit houses in North America}}
[[File:Knock down kits for houses Popular Mechanics 1908.png|thumb|Advertisement for knocked down kits for houses, in ''Popular Mechanics'', May 1908.]]
A 1908 advertisement in ''[[Popular Mechanics]]'' attests that knock-down kits for houses were on the market by the early 20th century, if not before.

{{Admiralty law}}

A '''Liner Conference System''' (also called a "shipping conference") is an agreement within the [[sea transport|shipping industry]] in relation to [[ocean liner]]s. Typically, the agreement is between two or more [[shipowner|shipping companies]] to provide scheduled cargo and/or passenger service on a particular trade route under uniform rates and common terms.&lt;ref&gt;Lecture notes: The Liner Conference is an organisation whereby a number of shipowners offer their services on a given sea route on conditions agreed by the members. Conferences are oligopolistic* associations of shipping lines formed for the purpose of restricting competition between members and protecting them from outside competition. They achieve their object
by controlling prices and limiting entry into the trade. The most important method employed to this aim is to establish a common tariff of freight rates and passenger fares. By limiting sailings and ports of call and by offering incentives (deferred rebate system and contract system) to loyal shippers, they provide a regularity of service to exporters that may not exist otherwise. Often when conferences perform special services, such as lifting unprofitable cargo or resorting to
chartering to cover temporary shortages of tonnage, they pool the losses or profit on such operations.
A shipping company usually belongs to several conferences. Members are left free to compete for traffic by the quality and efficiency of their service. Membership is international by character. Shippers frequently associate themselves into Councils to negotiate with Conferences on a footing of equal strength, as a countervailing power.
* An [[oligopoly]] is a formal or loose association of companies that act together so as to exercise the powers of monopoly. Revenue in some cases is pooled, and shared according to some formula."&lt;/ref&gt;

Although a Liner Conference System allows [[shipowner]]s to club together, enabling them to continue to operate a regular "liner service" and maintain requisite standards of service, there is a downside.  Such agreements may establish protectionist organisations that can involve [[monopoly]] abuse and possible breach of [[competition law]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://lup.lub.lu.se/luur/download?func=downloadFile&amp;recordOId=1562676&amp;fileOId=1566038 Thesis on Liner Conferences]&lt;/ref&gt; For instance, under [[European Community Law]], article 101&lt;ref&gt;Art.101 (1). The following shall be prohibited as incompatible with the internal market: all agreements between undertakings, decisions by associations of undertakings and concerted practices which may affect trade between Member States and which have as their object or effect the prevention, restriction or distortion of competition within the internal market, and in particular those which:

(a) directly or indirectly fix purchase or selling prices or any other trading conditions;

(b) limit or control production, markets, technical development, or investment;

(c) share markets or sources of supply;

(d) apply dissimilar conditions to equivalent transactions with other trading parties, thereby placing them at a competitive disadvantage;

(e) make the conclusion of contracts subject to acceptance by the other parties of supplementary obligations which, by their nature or according to commercial usage, have no connection with the subject of such contracts.

(2). Any agreements or decisions prohibited pursuant to this Article shall be automatically void.&lt;/ref&gt; of the [[Treaty of Rome]] ''(as amended)'' imposes a ''[[prima facie]]'' ban on anticompetitive "agreements between undertakings".&lt;ref&gt;An "undertaking" is EU-speak for a business, company or firm.&lt;/ref&gt; However, the Encyclopædia Britannica site&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.britannica.com/technology/ship/Types-of-ships#ref528316 Encyclopaedia Britannica]&lt;/ref&gt; states that overall the advantages to the public of Liner Conferences outweigh their disadvantages.&lt;ref&gt;"The shipping conference system has sometimes come under attack as tending to create a monopoly and to restrain competition against the public interest. It is, however, generally agreed that evidence is in favour of this system: it has been concluded that no realistically possible combination of shipping companies can force unreasonable rates and that shipping companies that provide regular sailings with good ships and maintain staffs and organizations in ports to handle and dispatch cargoes—irrespective of whether trade is good or bad—are entitled to some protection against the casual vessel that picks up an occasional cargo at cut rates."&lt;/ref&gt;

'''MSC Malaysia''', formerly the Multimedia Super Corridor and known as the '''MSC''' in Malaysia, is a [[Special Economic Zone]] and [[high-technology business district]] in central-southern [[Selangor]], [[Malaysia]].

==Geographical definition==
The MSC's northern end is at the [[Petronas Towers]] in downtown [[Kuala Lumpur]], extending through [[Cyberjaya]], [[Putrajaya]], the [[Kuala Lumpur International Airport]] and most of [[Sepang]] constituency, as well as parts of [[Bandar Tun Razak (federal constituency)|Bandar Tun Razak]], [[Puchong]] and [[Serdang, Selangor|Serdang]] constituencies, before terminating at [[Nilai]], [[Negeri Sembilan]].

==History==
The Multimedia Super Corridor (MSC) program was officially inaugurated by the fourth [[Prime Minister of Malaysia|Malaysian Prime Minister]] [[Mahathir Mohamad]] on 12 February 1996. The establishment of the MSC program was crucial to accelerate the objectives of Vision 2020 and to transform Malaysia into a modern state by 2020, with the adoption of a knowledge-based society framework.&lt;ref&gt;Jeong Chun Hai @Ibrahim, &amp; Nor Fadzlina Nawi. (2007). ''Principles of Public Administration: An Introduction.'' Kuala Lumpur: Karisma Publications. {{ISBN|978-983-195-253-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Jeong Chun Hai @Ibrahim. (2007). ''Fundamental of Development Administration.'' Selangor: Scholar Press. {{ISBN|978-967-5-04508-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Purpose==
The MSC flagship applications were launched to boost the MSC Malaysia initiatives and to create a hub for innovative producers and users of multimedia technology. Consortia comprising local and foreign companies (MNCs) collaborated with government agencies, departments and ministries to enhance the socio-economic development of Malaysia in the information age. The vision and mission of the Multimedia Super Corridor (MSC) as expressed by Dr Mahathir Mohammad, the Prime Minister of Malaysia at the time (1981–2003), is essentially this:

&lt;blockquote&gt;“MSC is paramount to leapfrog (Malaysia) into the 21st century and to achieve Malaysia’s Vision 2020, the MSC was created to endeavour the best environment to harness the full potential of the multimedia without any artificial limits. MSC is a global test bed (hub), where the limits of the possible can be explored, and new ways of living, working, and playing in the new area of the Information Age.”&lt;ref&gt;Ibrahim Ariff &amp; Goh Chen Chuan, 2000&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Jeong Chun Hai @Ibrahim, &amp; Nor Fadzlina Nawi. (2007). ''Principles of Public Administration: An Introduction.'' Kuala Lumpur: Karisma Publications. {{ISBN|978-983-195-253-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Jeong Chun Hai @Ibrahim. (2007). ''Fundamental of Development Administration.'' Selangor: Scholar Press. {{ISBN|978-967-5-04508-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The Multimedia Super Corridor is a government-designated zone in designed to [[Leapfrogging|leapfrog]] [[Malaysia]] into the [[Information Age|information and knowledge age]]. It aims to attract companies with temporary tax breaks and facilities such as high-speed Internet access and proximity to the [[Kuala Lumpur International Airport]].

MSC Malaysia covers an area of approximately {{convert|15|km|mi|abbr=on}} &amp;times; {{convert|50|km|mi|abbr=on}} (that is, {{convert|750|km2|mi2|abbr=on}}) stretching from the [[Petronas Towers|Petronas Twin Towers]] to the [[Kuala Lumpur International Airport]], and including the towns of [[Putrajaya]] and [[Cyberjaya]].

It was announced by former Prime Minister [[Mahathir bin Mohamad|Datuk Seri Dr Mahathir]] at the Multimedia Asia Conference on 1 August 1996. Mahathir's visit to the [[United States of America]] in January 1997 to promote the MSC to companies succeeded in attracting the interest of many large [[information technology]] companies. During the visit, an international advisory panel comprising 30 information technology experts were formed to exchange ideas toward the success of the MSC.

The [[Multimedia Development Corporation]] (MDeC, formerly MDC) was created to oversee development of the MSC. It was later renamed to Malaysia Digital Economy Corporation (MDEC).

&lt;/gallery&gt;

==Effects on press freedom==
Though Malaysian law had provided for strict government controls on print media since 1984, a founding principle of MSC Malaysia was that government censorship of the Internet would not be permitted. Seeing a loophole, journalist [[Steven Gan]] and colleague Premesh Chandran started an online news resource that would be free of the controls that they felt stifled print media.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.pbs.org/newshour/media/ipf/gan.html |title=Steven Gan, editor Malaysiakini |author= |year=2000 |work= |publisher=''[[PBS NewsHour]]'' |accessdate=29 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In November 1999, the pair founded Malaysiakini, an online, independent news source that would become one of Malaysia's most popular websites.&lt;ref name=BBC&gt;{{cite web |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/1028657.stm |title=Malaysia's first online paper |author= |date=20 November 2000 |work= |publisher=[[BBC News]] |accessdate=29 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was awarded a Free Media Pioneer award from the [[International Press Institute]] in 2001,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.publicintegrity.org/investigations/icij/journalists/profile/791/ |title=ICIJ Journalists: Steven Gan |author= |date= |work= |publisher=[[International Consortium of Investigative Journalists]] |accessdate=29 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Gan was awarded one of the 2000 [[CPJ International Press Freedom Awards]] for his work with the site.&lt;ref name=CPJ&gt;{{cite web |url=http://cpj.org/awards/2000/awards00.php |title=IPF Awards 2000 - Announcement |author= |year=2000 |work= |publisher=[[Committee to Protect Journalists]] |accessdate=29 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''MAG''' (orignally known as '''MaGnology''') is a community convention in Germany with a focus on various fan cultures, including [[video game]]s, [[anime]], [[manga]], [[influencer marketing|influencers]], [[cosplay]]. The MAG convention is held annually in [[Erfurt|Erfurt, Germany]]. The MaGnology was originally created by Hiro Yamada as a games, comics, manga and [[Japanese culture]] convention. The current concept, rebranded in 2018 as MAG, is organized by Super Crowd (previously named MaGnology UG) a Hamburg based events company and moved to Erfurt.

The inspiration for the new MAG concept as a community convention came from the shareholder's experience at other, overcrowded conventions in Germany and their desire to create a comfortable space for fans to meet their favourite creators.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;Gameswirtschaft Interview MAG 2018|[https://www.gameswirtschaft.de/events/mag-2018-erfurt-interview/], August 13, 2018&lt;/ref&gt;

The MAG was first held in 2015. The defining pillars of the MAG include the Fangress, a three days long workshop, keynotes, Q&amp;A, and pannels programm taking place in the Messe Erfurt congress center next to the exhibition; as well as the presence of high profile influencers and creators, exhibitors from the games, manga, anime and influencers industry, an Artist Alley where over 100 artists showcase their own creations, a cosplay contest as well as a [[Lolita Fashion]] tea party organized by the largest German Lolita Fashion association Court of Fables.

==History==
The first MAG, known at the time as ''MaGnology'', was held on June 05-07, 2015 in [[Hamburg, Germany]], at the brand academy.&lt;ref&gt;Mediennetz Hamburg|[http://www.mediennetz-hamburg.de/?MAIN=3&amp;RECORD=1490], 2015&lt;/ref&gt;  The following year, the event was held at the [[Museum für Kunst und Gewerbe Hamburg]] in July as a co-program for the ''Hokusai Manga'' exhibition in the museum.&lt;ref&gt;SHZ.de|[https://www.shz.de/regionales/schleswig-holstein/manga-messe-so-zeigen-sich-die-cosplayer-in-hamburg-id14152256.html], July 1, 2016&lt;/ref&gt; In 2017, the company MaGnology UG was founded by Hiro Yamada, Henning Kroll and THREAKS which organized the third installment of the convention.&lt;ref&gt;Firmen Wissen|[https://www.firmenwissen.de/az/firmeneintrag/22089/2151833697/SUPER_CROWD_ENTERTAINMENT_GMBH.html], May 05, 2017&lt;/ref&gt; It was held at the Hamburg Cruise Center and an estimated 3.500 visitors attended.&lt;ref&gt;Hamburg News|[https://www.hamburg-news.hamburg/en/conventions-events/magnology-games-convention-moving-hafencity/], June 1, 2017&lt;/ref&gt;

After the success of the 2017 edition, MAG announced that it would be moving to Erfurt, Germany for the foreseeable future. The official reason for the move away from Hamburg was stated as being the inability to find agreeable terms with the city of Hamburg in order to expand the convention.

On June 7th, 2018, it was announced that the MaGnology UG was being rebranded as Super Crowd Entertainment GmbH with two additional shareholders, the German influencer agency 2nd Wave, and the one of the top German gaming influencers PietSmiet. &lt;ref&gt;Gamesmarkt Mediabiz|[http://www.mediabiz.de/games/news/threaks-gruendet-event-startup-super-crowd-entertainment/431426], June 07, 2018&lt;/ref&gt;

==Content==

The MAG takes place over three days and focuses on several pillars, including the Fangress, Artist Alley, creators, Lolita tea party, anime, manga and cosplay. Each pillar is designed to cater for one or more communities and appropriate content is presented for each.

The MAG is open to all ages, with children under the age of 8 given free access to the entire convention. To view content rated USK 12+ and higher, visitors will be required to show a proof of age armband which they receive at the entrance.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;

===Fangress===

Located in the congress center of Messe Erfurt and on the stages of each hall, MAG offers catered content for each community. Visitors can attend any workshop, pannel, Q&amp;A and keynote without any additional fee. Experts of their respective fields are invited to host these sessions, allowing fans and professionals alike to join and learn.&lt;ref&gt;Making Games|[http://www.makinggames.biz/news/mag-neue-community-convention-in-erfurt-angekundigt,2329417.html], April 10, 2018&lt;/ref&gt;

===Artist Alley===

Like other anime and manga conventions, MAG invites international artists of comic, manga, fashion and more to exhibit on their showfloor. These artists are a mix of professionals and amateurs who are able to sell their creations to MAG visitors.&lt;ref&gt;Artist Alley MAG|[https://mag-con.de/aussteller-artist/], 2018&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Marcel Jacobo Laniado de Wind''' (June 4, 1927 – August 8, 1998) was an [[agricultural engineer]] and [[banker]] who held a number of important public and private positions in [[Ecuador]]. He was a [[Humanism|humanist]], and a public figure in Ecuador for his efforts to improve the country.

He founded both the "Banco de Machala," which helped develop the trade of bananas in the [[El Oro Province]] of Ecuador, and later in 1971 founded "Banco del Pacifico." He was known for creating credit approval policies friendly to all economic groups, including loans for small farmers and small businesses; microcredit for artisans and low income people. He was influential in bringing [[internet]] to much of Ecuador in the early 1990s. From 1984 to 1986, he served as Ecuador's Minister of Agriculture under [[Leon Febres Cordero]], as well as a number of other positions.

==Early life, education==
Marcel Jacobo Laniado de Wind was born on June 4, 1927 in [[Guayaquil]], [[Ecuador]]. His father, Maurice Jacob Laniado Hassig, was born in [[French Algeria]], and had both [[Jewish]] roots and roots in [[Haifa]] in [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]] (of the [[Ottoman Empire]]). Laniado Hassig emigrated to Ecuador via [[Manaus, Brazil]], and began living in a Jewish community in [[Quito]]. There Laniado Hassig met and married Fredika Wind Davila, a Dutch-Jewish woman who was born in Quito. Fredika Wind Davila's father was Maurice de Wind, a Dutch Jew, and her mother was Mercedes Davila Peñaherera of Quito.

Laniado Hassig started his career as a dealer and [[mechanic]]. He and his wife later moved to [[Ancon]], a small city in the [[Guayas Province|Guayas]] Province, where the British [[oil company]] Anglo Ecuadorian Oilfields Limited established its camp for all its personnel. According to Marcel Laniado de Wind, his father moved to the camp for protection against the [[epidemics]] sweeping Ecuador, as at the time Ancon was an island of development and health. There Laniado Hassig established the only hotel managed by a non-native, and also opened a small [[general store]]. Laniado Hassig soon pursued trading in the South border town [[Santa Rosa, El Oro|Santa Rosa, El Oro Province]], despite the wishes of his wife. He began importing [[textiles]] and [[livestock]].

At this time, three of his four children were born. Marcel was born in 1927, Cecilia was born in 1928, Marta was born 1930, and Rodrigo was born 1933. Marcel Laniado de Wind attended elementary school at the camp in Anco, and later boarded at La Salle School in [[Quito]], where he completed secondary studies.

;Seeking asylum in El Oro
In 1941, at age 14, Marcel Jacobo Laniado de Wind and his family were forced to seek refuge in [[Zaruma]] in the [[El Oro Province|Province of El Oro]] during the [[Ecuadorian-Peruvian War|Peruvian invasion of Ecuador]], the family lost its home and belongings. After the invasion Hassig and family moved momentarily to [[Guayaquil]], and then to [[Machala]] in the El Oro Province where they started from scratch. In Machala, his father began making iron components for [[ice maker]]s and [[gasoline pump]]s, and put together an ice maker factory and a gas station as a distributor for the British company Anglo Ecuadorian Oilfields, and managed to save enough to educate the children, chiefly in culture and Jewish tradition. After the war, his mother Wind Fredika of Laniado had to recreate personal documents and re-obtain a passport. She changed her name to Harriet instead of Fredika and was affectionately called "Rica".

Laniado de Wind's status as a child of immigrants, with a name that few locals could pronounce, framed him as an outsider. He admired the positive qualities of the social and economic elites in Ecuador, but observed vices and defects that created inequality and impeded the country's progress.

He completed undergraduate studies at the [[Escuela Agricola Panamericana|Pan American Agricultural School]] at El Zamorano, [[Honduras]], where he graduated in 1949 with a degree in [[agronomy]]. That year he returned to Machala. His father died a few months later, and at 22 years old he became head of the household and the family business. He helped care for his young siblings and helped educate Cecil in the [[United States]] and Rodrigo in [[Chile]].

==Mayor of Machala==
At 30 years old, in 1957, he became president of the Machala [[Rotary Club]], and spearheaded paving the first three streets in the city after raising money from the Municipality and the Development Bank. According to de Wind, "That made the machaleños think I could be a good mayor."&lt;ref name = "two"/&gt; He decided to run for office, and his win was considered an upset to the political order of the time, which was dominated by families with tight political and economic control of the region. As mayor of Machala, he depoliticized fiscal and municipal actions, and focused on infrastructure for drinking water, telephone communications, and wastewater management.

==Banco de Machala==
The [[El Oro Province|Province of El Oro]] was isolated from the rest of Ecuador many years after the Peruvian invasion in fear of a new invasion, which kept private investors away from the region. Public investment was also minimal, particularly the construction of roads. The only alternative to a long land route via the town of [[Cuenca, Ecuador|Cuenca]] to Machala is maritime transport via the [[Gulf of Guayaquil]]. After the war with [[Peru]], a fear of a new invasion kept investors away from the region. Attention from both the private and public sector was minimal. According to Laniado de Wind, "When I returned from school...I found conditions ripe for agricultural development. But there was no bank to pay services. [While running for Governor], I promised first that I would get a bank to open a branch in Machala. It proved impossible as no banks were interested. So I created one."&lt;ref name = "two"/&gt;

He ceased to be Governor in 1962, and after fund-raising five million [[sucre]]s using local capital, he founded the Banco de Machala later that year. It was the first and to date the only Machalan bank started with local funds. Within a few months the bank had a large modern building in Machala, which was comparable to major bank buildings of the time in cities such as Quito and [[Guayaquil]].

Laniado de Wind's stated goal was to create a trustworthy bank that was not dominated by elite families, and that would encourage private investment to help develop the province. Unlike other Ecuadorian banks of the time, individual [[shareholders]] did not control the bank.&lt;ref name = "two"/&gt;

He created gender-blind [[lines of credit]] for small and medium [[banana]] and [[coffee]] crop farmers. He also modernized processes of credit approval and the management of [[savings account|depository account]]s. At the time, the bank's semi-automatic payment of [[bank check|checks]] was unique in the country.

He also helped establish cooperative public [[trade unions in Ecuador]] such as the General Union of Teachers. This allowed the quality of education in the region to remain stable, even when the government routinely generated financial stoppages. This helped minimize strikes.

===Alamos Agricultural Society===
Around 1964, a partnership 75% Esteban Quirola Figueroa and 25% Marcel J Laniado acquired 11,000 Has. of a farm called "Los Alamos" located in Guayas Province, Churute Region, between the [[Gulf of Guayaquil]] and a town called Puerto Inca, a farm originally owned by [[Standard Fruit Company]] (later known as [[Dole Food Company|Dole]]), the largest independent producer of bananas in the world. Laniado de Wind was the first General Manager.
Basically Standard Fruit Company was losing this farm with a Communist labor Union, which did not allow working properly on the farm, low morale and a German origin manager incapable to bring the farm up to good production. Under this circumstances Standard Fruit Company proposed for Laniado de Wind to buy the property.
Laniado spoke fondly of "Los Alamos" as his favorite project. Under his management, the property began producing an average of 125,000 annual weekly boxes of bananas from a [[banana plantation]] of 3,000 Has. A new method of protection for each finger of the banana clusters was developed, allowing minimum shrinkage and high quality; a new banana packing plant design took place; new banana production methodology, new irrigation systems, etc. The technologies applied in Alamos soon became standard practices in Ecuadorian farming. In addition and in order to diversify a 300 Has. of oranges were planted; a 100 has. of vegetables were planted, and a ranch of 7,500 [[Santa Gertrudis cattle]] for beef was added, which routinely won awards at [[livestock fair]]s for the best specimen of the breed. 
He organized the estate to fit the needs of employees, and the farm had a [[commissary]], [[infirmary]], church, cinema, and parks for workers. A team of resident physicians provided the workers and their families with free health care.  In addition, all employee children had to attend the in-house based school, which at the time had a top curriculum, including the practice of the English language as a mandatory course.
It installed a rural telephone network, linking offices, houses and other buildings of the farm, for internal use, and connect with the rest of the country or internationally. this infrastructure were not found in other farms or rural towns in Ecuador at that time, was the first of its kind.

Natural areas such as the Churute Park Reserve were set aside and protected from [[poaching]]. The location focused on sanitation and clean water, and had an at the time innovative [[trash collection]] system.&lt;ref name = "seven"/&gt;

==Banco del Pacifico==
During 1970 and 1971 Marcel Laniado de Wind and his main partner Esteban Quirola developed different visions of the farm and bank business. Laniado de Wind proposed to his partner to either buy or sell the farm shares from or to him. Quirola agreed to sell to Laniado de Wind his 75% shares of the farm for an agreed price, as a "[[gentlemen's agreement]]." Quirola had already started to buy Banco de Machala shares from other shareholders and became the majority shareholder. Laniado de Wind traveled to New York to talk to contacts at [[Citibank]] for financing to buy Alamos. Standard Fruit Company committing to retain a percentage of the banana box price to repay the loan to Citibank, the loan was approved. Laniado de Wind returned to the country to close the deal, but Mr. Quirola changed his mind and decided to buy Laniado de Wind's 25% instead.&lt;ref name = "two"/&gt; Marcel Laniado de Wind resigned the day after Quirola's actions, selling his stake in Hacienda Los Alamo, resigning as General Manager of Los Alamos, and leaving his post as General Manager of Banco de Machala.&lt;ref name = "four"/&gt;

The day after resigning he started the process of founding a new bank. He presented the project to private investors and friends and convinced 447 investors to contribute 40 million sucres, and also to form the initial list of shareholders. On April 10, 1972, he went public with Banco del Pacifico.&lt;ref name = "four"/&gt;

The business model was revolutionary for its time. Other banks at the time were owned by elite family groups or institutions, and access to services and credit was typically reserved for [[economic stratification|social classes]] or groups the bank owners were familiar with. In contrast,  Banco del Pacifico proposed to serve all social and economic groups, and their slogan was "In the Banco del Pacifico you do not need to be a friend of the manager."&lt;ref name = "two"/&gt; The bank also democratized shareholding, as compared to allowing just a few shareholders to control the bank. Returns were not offered directly to a potential shareholder, who were instead motivated by the reward of helping develop the country. This business model remains unique in Ecuador.&lt;ref name = "four"/&gt;

Laniado de Wind claimed this system relied on the integrity of the singular banker, who was there to simply manage the resources of others while owning no shares. In this way, no shareholders could unduly influence the management of the bank. "We have a million customers with deposits exceeding six trillion sucres. One [person] manages the resources of the people and those resources cannot be used in personal business. We have no business. I have no shares in anything with anybody, and nobody can say 'I'm your partner.'"&lt;ref name = "two"/&gt; This allowed the bank to have a unique level of transparency within the financial system of Ecuador.&lt;ref name = "four"/&gt;

In 1972 a military coup ended the last [[History of Ecuador (1960–1990)|Velasco period]], initiating the country's oil era and the development of the state as an entrepreneur with strategic resources.&lt;ref name = "three"/&gt; The Banco del Pacifico began to provide credit and resources to regions that had previously been neglected, chiefly serving the [[middle class]] and the onslaught of private entrepreneurial companies appearing in the 1970s and 1980s. The bank grew extremely quickly, becoming one of the largest banks in the country, and eventually the largest.&lt;ref name = "four"/&gt;

===Advances===
Laniado de Wind gained a reputation as an innovator in developing electronic banking products. In 1975 Banco del Pacifico installed the first [[computer system]] in Ecuadorian banking, with a network of five line terminals. He also helped introduce the Audiomático, phone banking, Telebán, Intermático, computer banking, internet banking, and helped advance the processing of receipts and payments so that transactions could be completed from home or the office 24 hours every day.&lt;ref name = "four"/&gt;

;Credit to the Community
In 1977 the bank established the Artisan Credit program, later renamed Credit to the Community. This program was unique in its kind, only also offered by the [[Ford Foundation]]. This program provided [[micro loans]] to artisans in more deprived peripheral regions of the country. The loans were made without collateral or targeted preferential [[interest rate]]s, with the warranty and ability to pay determined by references from within the artisan community. The bank managed the loan and provided assistance with accounting if needed, and helped create accessible systems for the time and amount of payment.&lt;ref name = "four"/&gt;

"With its unique philosophy of providing greater access to credit to all sectors of the economy, including artisans and small businesses and becoming a catalyst for development of the country, the Banco del Pacifico revolutionized the financial system."&lt;ref name = "four"/&gt; The program was the flagship of Marcel Laniado de Wind, as he felt it justified the rationale for the bank. This program came to move from status to about 600 artisans to micro entrepreneurs per semester.&lt;ref name = "three"/&gt;

In 1979 it installed the first [[Automated teller machine|ATM Bancomático]] in the country, which was also the first in [[South America]].&lt;ref name = "four"/&gt; 1980 Banco del Pacifico was the first and only financial institution that offered a loan program for studies in foreign universities.&lt;ref name = "one"/&gt;
He also promoted the Swift system for Ecuador. The company installed the first Foreign Currency computer system, and later through the promotion of a third party created the Foreign Currency Trade market among Banks in Ecuador. After analyzing how gold was traded, and the complaints of small gold producers, the Bank installed the first gold buying program to small producers, and in few months became the major exporter of Gold in Ecuador, until a few years that Banco Central changes the rule and the Gold business was no longer was possible.

===EcuaNet===
In Ecuador, the first institution to provide access to the [[Internet]] was Ecuanex, an Internet node established in 1991 by the Agency for Electronic Communication Corporation, or [[Intercom]]. This network is part of the global network for Global Communications Institute / Alliance for Progressive Communications (IGC / APC), which provides this service to NGOs and development."&lt;ref name = "five"/&gt;

In 1992, Laniado created a subsidiary of Banco del Pacifico called EcuaNet, whose purpose was to provide Internet service to Ecuador via a second node. It was especially intended to be free for educational institutions and non-profit organizations. Already a year before the first Internet node had been formed and developed, Ecuanex offered the service solely to nonprofit institutions in Quito such as [[Accion Ecologica]], ALAI, CAAP, CITY, CONUEP, [[FLACSO]], and the [[List of universities in South America|Universidad Andina Simon Bolivar]].

===Subsidiaries===
Under his leadership, Banco del Pacifico constituted a number of domestic and foreign [[subsidiaries]].
*Pacific National Bank N. A ([[Miami, USA]])
*Pacific National Bank S. A. ([[Panama]])
*Pacific National Bank ([[Colombia]])

*Almagro Storekeeper of Agriculture
*[[Unicredit]] ([[MasterCard]] of Ecuador)
*Leasing del Pacifico
*Factor del Pacifico
*Valores del Pacifico
*Seguros Sucre, bought from Royal Insurance UK

The Pacifico Financial Group constituted Ecuador's largest, under the leadership of Marcel Laniado de Wind. The Pacific Group created the Huancavilca Foundation. The formation of neighborhood shops with access to competitively priced food was the central goal of the foundation. It considered stores a basis for community development, by selling quality food for the lowest possible price. The Foundation developed the first Community Development Center in Guasmo, south of [[Guayaquil]].

Huancavilca Foundation also provided banking services to the community served by the school by moving the ominous presence of chulqueros ([[loan sharks]]). It included a collection center for recyclable materials, distribution of construction materials, and the develop of pharmacy and mail services and public telephones.

Laniado de Wind remained a supporter of his alma mater, the [[Escuela Agricola Panamericana]] in Zamorano, Honduras.

In 1996 Laniado de Wind and Zamoranos founded the Wilson Popenoe Foundation, with the sole purpose of funding scholarships for Ecuadorians to assist to Zamorano. It started with an endowment from [[Wilson Popenoe]] "Doris Stone" to finance the education of Ecuadorians in El Zamorano, with the Banco del Pacifico intervening as a counterpart. When he was minister of agriculture in 1984, he obtained a U.S. Aid fund for the same purpose. He later became a member of the Board of Trustees of El Zamorano in [[Boston, USA]].

After Laniado de Wind's death, Banco del Pacifico became a casualty of the [[1998–99 Ecuador banking crisis]], and ownership of the bank passed into government hands.

'''Marcelo Hugo Tinelli''' (born 1 April 1960, [[San Carlos de Bolívar]]) is an [[Argentina|Argentine]] [[Television|TV]] host, media producer and businessman, best known as the host of the TV show ''ShowMatch'' broadcast on Argentina's [[Canal 13 (Argentina)|El Trece]]. He is one of the most iconic figures in Argentina's television. Tinelli is one of the most famous supporters of the [[San Lorenzo de Almagro]] football club of all time. He is the current Vice-President of the Boedo's side.

Tinelli was working on [[LS5|Radio Rivadavia]] as [[football (soccer)|football]] [[sportscaster]] before Juan Alberto Badía brought him to TV to ''Badía y Compañía''. In 1990, after several years as sports commentator, he created the light-content ''Videomatch'', based on sport results, easy jokes, [[hidden camera]]s and [[blooper]]s.

Afterwards, he hosted the variety-musical show ''[[Ritmo de la Noche]]'' which featured live performances of international acts including [[Bon Jovi]], [[Poison (American band)|Poison]], [[Duran Duran]] and former [[Queen (band)|Queen]] member [[Brian May]]. Around 1996 the program left the lightest contents and included musical shows and guests. In 1999 he received the Golden [[Martín Fierro Awards|Martín Fierro Award]] for ''[[Videomatch]]''. The show still airs, as ''[[Showmatch]]''. 

He created the TV production company ''Ideas del Sur'' (Ideas from the South), which has produced many TV shows including ''Okupas'', ''Buenos Vecinos'', ''Tumberos'', ''Fugitivos'' and ''[[Los Roldán]]''. He also bought Radio Uno FM station, and the Spanish [[Segunda División]] football club [[CD Badajoz]]. 

In 2002, he helped found the [[volleyball]] team [[Club Ciudad de Bolívar]], based in his native San Carlos de Bolívar. The team came to be the most successful of the [[Liga Argentina de Voleibol – Serie A1|Argentine league]].

==''Videomatch/ShowMatch''==
He became popular as the presenter of Argentina's high-rated show ''[[Videomatch]]'' on the Argentine network Telefe. The variety show had sketches, musical guests, contests, and introduced bloopers to the Argentine audience.

Tinelli caused controversy in 2005, when he announced plans to switch to [[Canal 9 (Argentina)|Canal 9]], the third highest rated network.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.obserdiscriminacion.gov.ar/informes.html Informe Sobre Discriminación en el Programa "Showmatch"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090422203235/http://www.obserdiscriminacion.gov.ar/informes.html|date=22 April 2009|accessdate=3 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; His show increased the average audience of Canal 9 by giving the network the highest-rated show in the country. 

In 2006 Tinelli announced a switch to [[Canal 13 (Argentina)|El Trece]], Telefe's largest competitor. Tinelli works at El Trece since then, and also produces TV dramas with his own production company, [[Ideas del Sur]]. The show title changed from ''Videomatch'' to ''[[Showmatch]]'' since the Videomatch name was owned by Telefe. ''Showmatch'' is also the name of a short-lived version of ''Videomatch'' that aired in [[Spain]].{{Citation needed|date=March 2008}} 

ShowMatch included many segments of contests with stage acts, such as dancing or singing. In 2009 it included a segment called [[Gran Cuñado]] (Big Brother-in-Law) with parodies of Argentine politicians, that generated great stir in real political world.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.elargentino.com/nota-46584-Gran-Cunado-y-la-intencion-de-voto.html El efecto de Gran Cuñado sobre la intención de voto] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090627112321/http://www.elargentino.com/nota-46584-Gran-Cunado-y-la-intencion-de-voto.html|date=27 June 2009}} {{es icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal life==
{{unsourced|section|date=June 2017}}
Tinelli married his first [[wife]], Soledad Aquino, in 1986. The couple had two children: Micaela in (born in 1988), and Candelaria (born in 1990). The couple [[Divorce|divorced]] in 1993. Following his divorce, in 1997 he married for the second time with Paula Robles. They met at one of the shows he hosted (Ritmo de la noche). The couple lasted 12 years, during that period of time they had two children. The couple divorced in 2009. In April 2014, Tinelli had his fifth child with Guillermina Valdes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0863906/bio|title=Marcelo Tinelli|website=IMDb.com|accessdate=2017-06-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.minutouno.com/notas/307323-marcelo-tinelli-sorprendio-un-increible-tatuaje-toda-su-espalda |title=Marcelo Tinelli sorprendió con un increíble tatuaje en toda su espalda &amp;#124; Marcelo Tinelli |website=Minutouno.com |date= |accessdate=2017-06-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8877">'''Marketing accountability''' is a term that signifies [[management]] with [[data]] that is understandable to the management of the enterprise. Other names that have been given to this process include "Marketing Performance Measurement", "Marketing Performance Management", "Marketing ROI", "ROMI", and "Accountable Marketing".

==Overview==

Within marketing accountability the expression “[[integrated marketing communications]]” (IMC) implies that [[marketing]] and [[communications]] are integrated within the business and management of the enterprise, not as a stand-alone functional silo. Analogous to other business functions like [[manufacturing]] and [[sales]], accountable marketing is based on a set of valid outcome [[performance indicator]]s and the associated activity input costs. Outcome performance indicators are called Effectiveness Metrics; Effectiveness combined with costs is called [[Efficiency]] (effectiveness per dollar spent).&lt;ref name="w"&gt;Winiarz, Marek P.E., The Method Handbook, Innovative Message for Managing, Method Marketing and Communications, MMC/SAN-06-0003-HB, February 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the Common Language Marketing Dictionary, marketing accountability refers to the use of metrics to link a firm's marketing actions to financially relevant outcomes and growth over time. This accountability allows marketing to take responsibility for the profit or loss from investments in marketing activities, and to demonstrate the financial contributions of specific marketing programs to the overall financial objectives of the firm, including brand asset value. Return on marketing investment (ROMI), customer acquisition costs, and retention rates are examples of commonly employed marketing accountability metrics.[1]&lt;ref&gt;http://www.marketing-dictionary.org/m/Marketing+Accountability&lt;/ref&gt;

Recent research by the Forbes CMO Practice&lt;ref&gt;https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbesinsights/2017/05/02/the-marketing-performance-credibility-gap/2/#149106b55f6a&lt;/ref&gt; and the Marketing Accountability Standards Board &lt;ref&gt;https://themasb.org/resources/white-papers/&lt;/ref&gt;shows CMO are under growing pressure to show returns on rising investments in marketing assets, new media, data, analytics and technology needed to compete for digitally enabled customers.  The complexity of marketing accountability has growth as marketers must add many more investments to the marketing portfolio to adapt to changing customer preferences and compete effectively for market share. According to Forbes research, the CMO of the average Global 5000 company must now allocate resources across at least 20 primary investment types in their annual budget.

==Methodology==
In order for indicators to be considered valid for [[accountability]], they must meet a few minimum requirements. They need to measure marketing outcomes from the [[consumer]]s’ point of view, they need to include all marketing activities, they must be repeated over time, and they must meet statistical and technical criteria required of all [[measurement system]]s.

The measurements need to be true outcome indicators. Unlike sales where the outcome is easily quantifiable, marketing is more difficult to define: there is not a direct, fast-acting relationship between marketing activities and sales. Some marketing materials are designed to inform, others attempt to portray the product or service attractively, yet others attempt to influence purchasing behavior. Most [[marketing campaign]]s include all three orientations; a brand may have glossy ads to boost attractiveness, [[brochure]]s to convey information, and [[coupon]]s with expiration dates to stimulate purchases. Thus a multiplicity of channels and contacts that influence target consumers needs to be measured together in order to understand the overall effect, and the separate [[effectiveness]] of the programs. The outcome indicator can be called “Brand Experience”, and only consumers can discern the resultant brand experience in the clutter of the marketplace as each message competes with others for attention.&lt;ref name="j"&gt;Jamhouri, Oscar, The Brand Experience Handbook, Process and Toolbox for Effective Brand Experience Strategies, Version 4, Integration Marketing Communications, September 2004.&lt;/ref&gt;

To assure meaningful comparisons among activities, brands, markets, and points in time; the metrics must use a common scale—a “common currency”. This is quite obvious in [[accounting]] systems for [[multinational corporation]]s, but in marketing all too often this principle is ignored. Different communications activities are evaluated using different measurements. These methods fall short of accountability in that the activities cannot be compared directly and their [[Synergy|synergies]] cannot be discerned. Only measurement systems that use common units&amp;nbsp;– to evaluate each contact, each market, and each competitor&amp;nbsp;— can result in marketing accountability.&lt;ref name="jk"&gt;Jamhouri, Oscar; Krause, Hans Ulrich, “Beyond Media Plans: Brand Experience Strategy”, (European Society of Opinion and Market Research Professionals (ESOMAR) Conference 2002.&lt;/ref&gt;

Marketing activity outcomes must be gathered on a continuous basis in time. While a single reading may provide some insight into the condition before marketing begins, accountability comes from understanding cause and effect. This knowledge comes from repeated examinations over time that show changes from marketing initiatives (from brand and competition) and the evolution of consumers’ needs. [[Harold Geneen]] in his groundbreaking book “Managing” explains the role of an effective CEO: to repeatedly evaluate performance numbers on a continuous basis. Only long term observation brings true insight of unanticipated changes and “red flags” in the data.&lt;ref name="gm"&gt;Geneen, Harold; Moscow, Alvin, Managing, Doubleday and Company Inc., 1984.&lt;/ref&gt;

All measurement systems are prone to [[misinterpretation]] and [[error]]. Together these form the science of [[metrology]]. Measurement accuracy, repeatability, reproducibility, bias, data shifts, and data drifts are only a few common issues identified in measurement, and any useful system must be evaluated from the technical point of view to assure that it addresses these criteria. It is essential that measurement error is quantified so that managers react to changes in conditions, but not changes due to measurement variation. At the very least, all measurements need to show statistical [[confidence interval]]s or so-called “error bars”.&lt;ref name="et"&gt;Efron, Bradley; Tibshirani, Robert J., An Introduction to the Bootstrap, Chapman &amp; Hall/CRC, 1998.&lt;/ref&gt; Independent organizations like the Advertising Research Foundation evaluate the validity of commonly used measurement systems.&lt;ref name="cw"&gt;Cook, Dr. William A., “An (Advertising Research Foundation (ARF) Research Review of Integration Marketing &amp; Communications Limited’s Market ContactAudit TM Metrics Significance Assessment Methodology”, ARF&amp;nbsp;– The Research Authority, April 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

These outcome indicators, representing the condition in the marketplace, are combined with financial data to show efficiency of the marketing process. The financials are inputs: dollars spent for marketing activities. The best and most informative systems use [[Activity based costing]] (ABC) that track costs by each marketing activity, rather than traditional cost accounting by salaries, facilities, equipment, and materials.&lt;ref name="abc"&gt;ABC: Kaplan, Robert S., Cooper, Robin, ''Cost and Effect, Using Integrated Cost Systems to Drive Profitability and Performance'', Harvard Business School Press, 1997, {{ISBN|0-875-84-788-9}}.&lt;/ref&gt; ABC methods have the best [[fidelity]] as they show contribution efficiency (Brand Experience/$ spent) of each activity, and they may be summed in desired combinations (or campaigns). Understanding competitors costs and brand experience can lead to [[benchmarking]], a comparison to what is considered the best in class.

A well-implemented [[business process]] that yields common valid outcome indicators combined with spending levels leads to understanding of marketing performance. Using this “common currency” allows [[enterprise management]], [[marketing management]] and other managers to understand marketing performance effectiveness and efficiency. Additionally, marketing accountability [[Performance metric|metrics]] become understandable across management levels as senior managers and lower ranks all see and interpret the same information. The resultant [[transparency (behavior)|transparency]] allows all to interpret marketing performance in the same way and promotes concentration toward the most effective and efficient marketing.

[[Malay titles|Dato' Seri]] [[Hajji|Haji]] '''Mukhriz bin Mahathir''' ([[Jawi alphabet|Jawi]]: مخريز بن محضير; born 25 November 1964) is a Malaysian politician who is the current [[List of Menteris Besar of Kedah|Menteri Besar]] (Chief Minister) of the State of [[Kedah]]. From 2008 to 2013 he was the federal Deputy Minister of International Trade and Industry. He is the third son of [[Mahathir Mohamad]], the current [[Prime Minister of Malaysia]].

He is a former member of the [[United Malays National Organisation]] (UMNO) in Malaysia's ruling [[Barisan Nasional]] coalition. Like his father, he left UMNO in 2016. Mukhriz is currently the Deputy President of [[Malaysian United Indigenous Party|Parti Pribumi Bersatu Malaysia]] (PPBM, Malaysian United Indigenous Party) and the chairman of the [[Pakatan Harapan]] coalition in Kedah.

==Political career==

===Pre-parliamentary career===
In 2004, he won election to the executive council of UMNO's youth wing, by garnering the highest number of votes of any candidate.&lt;ref&gt;[http://202.188.124.45/umno2004/foto.php?cat=2004&amp;page=1 PHOTO GALLERY]{{dead link|date=February 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://atimes01.atimes.com/atimes/Southeast_Asia/FI24Ae05.html UMNO elections a time for reinvention] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070622033859/http://atimes01.atimes.com/atimes/Southeast_Asia/FI24Ae05.html |date=22 June 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He was also seen as a potential candidate for being the deputy chief of UMNO Youth, but he later withdrew his candidacy.&lt;ref name="malaysia-today.net"&gt;[http://www.malaysia-today.net/loonyMY/2005/06/sabah-battleground-for-umno-deputy.htm Sabah: the battleground for the Umno Deputy Presidency (part 2)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061211004615/http://www.malaysia-today.net/loonyMY/2005/06/sabah-battleground-for-umno-deputy.htm |date=11 December 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mukhriz was noted for his continuous efforts in speaking for his father in the events of the rift between Prime Minister [[Abdullah Ahmad Badawi|Tun Abdullah Ahmad Badawi]] and his father.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20071013161828/http://www.malaysia-today.net/Blog-e/2006/05/baptism-of-fire-for-mukhriz.htm Baptism of fire for Mukhriz?]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ytlcommunity.com/commnews/shownews.asp?newsid=23547 Remarks unfair, unwarranted: Umno Youth]&lt;/ref&gt; In 2006, his father lost a bid to be elected as one of seven delegates from [[Kubang Pasu District|Kubang Pasu]] to UMNO's general assembly; Mukhriz was elected as one of the seven.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dailyexpress.com.my/news.cfm?NewsID=44345 Mukhriz shocked; claims move well-planned] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070926234502/http://www.dailyexpress.com.my/news.cfm?NewsID=44345 |date=26 September 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Mukhriz drew flak from sections of UMNO after he commented on Prime Minister Abdullah's speech at the assembly that he was a "little bit" disappointed and that it had offered nothing new.&lt;ref&gt;[http://thestar.com.my/news/story.asp?file=/2006/11/16/nation/16036138&amp;sec=nation Mukhriz: Nothing new in speech] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061117120105/http://www.thestar.com.my/news/story.asp?file=%2F2006%2F11%2F16%2Fnation%2F16036138&amp;sec=nation |date=17 November 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He later apologised for his remarks.&lt;ref&gt;[http://thestar.com.my/news/story.asp?file=/2006/11/25/nation/16129084&amp;sec=nation Mukhriz to face Youth exco] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110521092409/http://thestar.com.my/news/story.asp?file=%2F2006%2F11%2F25%2Fnation%2F16129084&amp;sec=nation |date=21 May 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Federal parliamenterian (2008–2013)===
In the [[Malaysian general election, 2008|2008 Malaysian general election]], Mukhriz won the [[Jerlun (federal constituency)|Jerlun]] Parliament Seat with the sum of the DUN differing markedly from Parlimen.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.utusan.com.my/utusan/info.asp?y=2008&amp;dt=0222&amp;pub=Utusan_Malaysia&amp;sec=Muka_Hadapan&amp;pg=mh_05.htm Mukhriz ke Parlimen Jerlun]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.malaysiakini.com/news/78398 Kedah: Mukhriz to fight Jerlun, Badruddin stays in Jerai]&lt;/ref&gt; Before this, he offered himself to contest in [[Langkawi (federal constituency)|Langkawi]] Parliament Seat but was rejected by 85 out of 91 UMNO branches in Langkawi.&lt;ref&gt;[http://thestar.com.my/news/story.asp?file=/2008/2/20/north/20380904&amp;sec=north8 Mukhriz ‘the right man to contest in Langkawi’] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110521095539/http://thestar.com.my/news/story.asp?file=%2F2008%2F2%2F20%2Fnorth%2F20380904&amp;sec=north8 |date=21 May 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, many [[Langkawi]] leaders backed him later. The Jerlun UMNO division welcomed Mukhriz to contest in their Parliament seat and promised to give him full support in the election.&lt;ref&gt;[http://nobisha.blogspot.com/2008/02/mukhriz-selamat-datang-ke-jerlun.html Mukhriz, Selamat Datang ke Jerlun!].&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2009, Mukhriz contested as a candidate for the new [[UMNO]] Youth Chief after the wing's predecessor, Datuk Seri [[Hishamuddin Hussein]] released his position. He was rivalled by [[Khairy Jamaluddin]] and [[Khir Toyo]]. Nominations for the posts coincided with division meetings which took place between October and November 2008. Mukhriz was initially seen as leading in nominations compared to Khairy but eventually lost in the final vote count.

However, a controversy was sparked when Khairy was allowed to contest for the post even though he was found guilty for being involved with [[bribery|money politics]] by the UMNO Disciplinary Board,&lt;ref name="kj-rasuah"&gt;[http://www.harakahdaily.net/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=020051&amp;Itemid=99 Pilih Khairy, Pemuda Umno hilang hala tuju] – from harakahdaily.net. Accessed on 29 March 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; while others who were found guilty for the same offence, such as [[Mohd Ali Rustam]] who was supposed to contest for the [[UMNO]] Vice-President post, were not allowed to contest for their respective posts. However, Khairy denied the allegation, as stated in his blog.&lt;ref name="kj-tak-rasuah"&gt;[http://www.rembau.net.my/news_list.asp?uid=436 Penjelasan Mengenai Keputusan Lembaga Disiplin UMNO]{{dead link|date=February 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} {{ms icon}} – from Khairy's official blog, Rembau.net. Accessed on 29 March 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

===First term as Menteri Besar Kedah (2013–2016)===
In the [[Malaysian general election, 2013|2013 election]], Mukhriz gave up his seat in federal parliament to contest the Kedah State Assembly seat of Ayer Hitam. The move was taken with a view to becoming the Chief Minister of Kedah if the Barisan Nasional coalition could defeat the [[Pakatan Rakyat]] state government led by [[Azizan Abdul Razak]]. Mukhriz won Ayer Hitam (defeating the [[Pan-Malaysian Islamic Party]] (PAS) incumbent), Barisan Nasional reclaimed the state government, and Mukhriz was sworn in as Chief Minister on 6 May, the day after the election, in the presence of his father.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://thestar.com.my/news/story.asp?file=/2013/5/7/nation/13076403&amp;sec=nation|title=GE13: Mukhriz sworn in as Kedah MB|date=7 May 2013|work=The Star|accessdate=12 May 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130529031755/http://thestar.com.my/news/story.asp?file=%2F2013%2F5%2F7%2Fnation%2F13076403&amp;sec=nation|archive-date=29 May 2013|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 21 June 2013 Mukhriz attempted to charge Penang for the use of water from a river located in Penang state, on the basis that the source of the water was in Kedah. In return the Chief Minister for Penang, [[Lim Guan Eng]], requested the Kedah government to pay rent for the land which the river occupies in Penang state.

In January 2016, UMNO Kedah leaders, led by [[Ahmad Bashah Md Hanipah]], declare the loss of confidence towards Mukhriz due to "his inability to maintain a united party leadership".&lt;ref name="hilangpercaya"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Ghazali|first1=Adha|title=UMNO Kedah hilang kepercayaan terhadap Mukhriz|url=http://www.bharian.com.my/node/116315|accessdate=3 February 2016|agency=Berita Harian|date=3 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The move is widely believed to be a reprisal orchestrated by the Prime Minister [[Najib Razak]]'s camp in UMNO, which was increasingly infuriated by Mahathir's and Mukhriz's criticisms against Najib.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2016-02-03/mahathir-s-son-ousted-as-malaysia-premier-tightens-grip-on-power|title=Mahathir's Son Ousted as Malaysia Premier Tightens Grip on Power|date=3 February 2016|work=[[Bloomberg Businessweek|Bloomberg]]|accessdate=4 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He resigned on 3 February 2016 after losing the majority of support among the assemblymen.&lt;ref name="mbk-resign"&gt;{{cite news|title=Mukhriz Mahathir letak jawatan MB Kedah|url=http://www.bharian.com.my/node/120683|accessdate=3 February 2016|agency=Berita Harian|date=3 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ahmad Bashah, who is also the Bakar Bata assemblyman, succeeded him as the 12th Chief Minister of Kedah.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.themalaysianinsider.com/malaysia/article/ahmad-bashah-is-new-kedah-mb|title=Ahmad Bashah is new Kedah MB|date=3 February 2016|work=The Malaysian Insider|accessdate=3 February 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160203134349/http://www.themalaysianinsider.com/malaysia/article/ahmad-bashah-is-new-kedah-mb|archive-date=3 February 2016|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mukhriz was expelled from UMNO together with Muhyiddin Yassin in June 2016.

===Parti Pribumi Bersatu Malaysia (PPBM) (2016- present)===

In August 2016, Mukhriz together with Tun Dr Mahathir, Tan Sri Muhyiddin Yassin, Syed Saddiq Syed Abdul Rahman, Kamarulazman Habibur Rahman, Anina Saadudin and Akhramsyah Sanusi formed Parti Pribumi Bersatu Malaysia (PPBM).

Mukhriz is currently the Deputy President of PPBM and the Chairman of Pakatan Harapan in Kedah.

=== Second term as Menteri Besar Kedah (2018- present)===
In the 2018 general election, the Pakatan Harapan (PH) coalition led by new Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad, Mukhriz's father, won 18 of the 36 state assembly seats.

He took his oath of office before Kedah Sultan Tunku Sallehuddin Ibni Almarhum Sultan Badlishah in a ceremony held in Istana Anak Bukit.

==Business career and personal life==
Mukhriz attended [[Sophia University]], in [[Tokyo]], where he received a [[bachelor's degree]] in [[business management]] in 1982. He later received another [[bachelor's degree]] in [[marketing]] after graduating from [[Boston University]] in 1987.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.pknk.gov.my/index.php?option=com_content&amp;id=547&amp;Itemid=218 |title=Yab Dato’ Seri Paduka Hj Mukhriz Bin Tun Mahathir |format= |work= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.mynewshub.cc/2016/02/03/mukhriz-hanya-mampu-bertahan-3-tahun-sebagai-mb-kedah/ |title=Mukhriz Hanya Mampu Bertahan 3 Tahun Sebagai MB Kedah - MYNEWSHUB |format= |work= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Natalia Ponce de León''' (born c. 1981) is a Colombian woman and crime victim who successfully campaigned for a law targeting perpetrators of [[Acid throwing|acid attacks]] in her country.

==Attack==
Ponce de León, who was a successful business woman, was assaulted by Jonathan Vega,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.eltiempo.com/bogota/sigue-el-juicio-contra-jonthan-vega-el-agresor-de-natalia-ponce-/16643615|title=Avanza el juicio contra Jonathan Vega, el agresor de Natalia Ponce - Bogotá - El Tiempo|last=Tiempo|first=Casa Editorial El|newspaper=El Tiempo|language=es-CO|access-date=2016-12-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; who threw a liter of [[sulphuric acid]] on her face and body on March 27, 2014&lt;ref name="america.aljazeera.com"&gt;[http://america.aljazeera.com/articles/2015/4/11/survivors-of-acid-attacks-in-Colombia-fight-for-justice.html aljazeera.com retrieved 8th Dec 2016]&lt;/ref&gt; while she was visiting her mother in Santa Barbára.&lt;ref&gt;Charner, Flora.

Retrieved from: http://america.aljazeera.com/articles/2015/4/11/survivors-of-acid-attacks-in-Colombia-fight-for-justice.html&lt;/ref&gt; Vega, a former neighbor, was reported to have been "obsessed" with Ponce de León and had been making death threats against her after she turned down his proposal for a relationship.&lt;ref name="america.aljazeera.com"/&gt; 24% of her body was severely burned as a result of the attack.&lt;ref&gt;Colombia: Man accused of high profile acid attack arrested. (2014). ''BBC News.''

==Public outcry and new law==
However, her case was not an isolated incident. Three years before the attack took place, [[Colombia]] reported one of the highest rates of [[acid attack]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;s per capita in the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.fucsia.co/personajes/nacionales/article/colombia-lider-vergonzoso-en-ataques-con-acido/49533|title=Colombia, líder vergonzoso en ataques con ácido|website=www.fucsia.co|access-date=2016-12-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, there was not an effective law in place until Ponce de León's campaign took off in the months after her attack.

The new law, which is named after her, defines acid attacks as a specific crime and increases [[Sentence (law)|maximum sentences]] to 50 years in jail for convicted offenders.&lt;ref name="dailyrecord" /&gt; The law also aims to provide victims with better state medical care including reconstructive surgery and psychological therapy. Ponce de León expressed hope that the new law would act as a deterrent against future attacks.&lt;ref name="dailyrecord" /&gt;

==Media coverage==
Ponce de León bravely spoke publicly with a protective mask during her campaigning. However, she decided to show her face when the book ''El renacimiento de Natalia Ponce de León (The Rebirth of Natalia Ponce de León)'', which tells her story, was published in April 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.eltiempo.com/politica/justicia/caso-natalia-ponce-de-leon-libro-escrito-por-la-periodista-martha-soto/15555377|title=El renacimiento de Natalia Ponce de León - Justicia - El Tiempo|last=Tiempo|first=Casa Editorial El|newspaper=El Tiempo|language=es-CO|access-date=2016-12-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Five thousand dollars in seed money was provided by The Minute Maid Company (then CEO Don Knauss was an early Champion; Ahold USA CEO Bill Grize was one of the first retail leaders to lend his support). NEW held a kick-off meeting at the FMI Midwinter Executive Conference, January 22, 2001, and NEW's first official meeting was held April 2, 2001 in New York City. On June 1, 2001, NEW held its second official meeting and elected its first Board and Officer slate.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="25745">'''ORCA''' was a mobile-optimized [[web application]] used as a component of the "[[get out the vote]]" (GOTV) efforts for [[Mitt Romney presidential campaign, 2012|Mitt Romney's 2012 presidential campaign]]. It was intended to enable volunteers in [[polling station]]s around the country to report which voters had turned out, so that "missing" Republican voters and underperforming precincts could be targeted for last-minute efforts to get voters to the polls. According to Romney himself, it would provide an "unprecedented advantage" to the campaign to "ensure that every last supporter makes it to the polls."

The system had major technical problems during Election Day that prevented many volunteers from using it. It crashed periodically and at one point was intentionally taken down when a surge of traffic from campaign volunteers was misinterpreted as a [[denial of service attack]]. Frustrated volunteers reported being unable to access ORCA and criticised a lack of prior briefing, misleading instructions and patchy on-the-day support. A Romney aide commented that "[[Orca]] is lying on the beach with a [[harpoon]] in it." The system's failings have been attributed by technology writers to a combination of factors including not doing prior quality assurance or beta testing, inadequate documentation and poor design.

The Romney campaign subsequently defended ORCA as a success, though campaign officials admitted that the system "had its challenges". Conservative activists and writers blamed ORCA for depressing Republican turnout on election day. While political scientists have rebutted these claims, suggested that it probably did not have a decisive effect on the outcome, it may have negatively affected turnout figures. ORCA has been compared unfavorably with a "get out the vote" and data effort from President Obama, including [[Project Narwhal]], seen as more robust.

[[File:ORCA application display.jpg|thumb|right|350px|Annotated illustration of the ORCA web application running on an iPhone]]
In the [[United States presidential election, 2008|2008 US presidential election]], the [[Barack Obama presidential campaign, 2008|Obama campaign]] utilized a system called [[Project Houdini|Houdini]] to enable volunteers to report voting data to a national hotline.&lt;ref name="HuffPost-Project ORCA"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/11/01/project-orca-mitt-romney_n_2052861.html|title=Project ORCA: Mitt Romney Campaign Plans Massive, State-Of-The-Art Poll Monitoring Effort|last=Terkel|first=Amanda|work=Huffington Post|date=November 1, 2012|accessdate=December 2, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; While this system encountered problems,&lt;ref name="Ars which consultants" /&gt; the [[Mitt Romney presidential campaign, 2012|2012 Romney campaign]]'s ORCA system aimed to go further by enabling volunteers to report such data to campaign headquarters in real time via their [[smartphone]]s. It was intended to be rolled out to around 37,000 volunteers at polling places in swing states.&lt;ref name="Ars" /&gt;

Gail Gitcho, the Romney campaign's communications director, told [[PBS]] on November 5 that with the deployment of ORCA on election day, the campaign would be able to tell who had voted in which precincts.&lt;ref name="Ars" /&gt; She described the system's key function as not being to predict the outcome, but to identify low turnouts in target precincts so that the campaign could take action by contacting missing voters and urging them to go to the polls. Gitcho commented: "The Obama campaign likes to brag about their ground operation, but it's nothing compared to this."&lt;ref name="Warner"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.pbs.org/newshour/politics/romney-campaign-enlists-help-of-killer-whale-project-to-get-out-the-vote|title=Romney Campaign Enlists Help of 'Killer Whale' Project to Get Out the Vote|last=Warner|first=Margaret|date=November 5, 2012|accessdate=December 2, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The name ORCA was chosen to reference the Obama [[Get out the vote|GOTV]] system, called [[Project Narwhal]]; in nature, the [[orca]] or killer whale is the only known non-human predator of [[narwhal]]s.&lt;ref name="Warner" /&gt;

In a training call for Republican volunteers on October 31, they were told: "There's nothing that the Obama data team, there's nothing that the Obama campaign, there's nothing that President Obama himself can do to even come close to what we are putting together here." &lt;ref name="HuffPost-Project ORCA" /&gt; According to reports, "The governor [Romney] loves seeing data, he loves seeing numbers and he's a very strategic person; he's a very smart man. So he actually loves being inside these war rooms, seeing the data come in and seeing exactly what's going on out there, so we can all put our heads together and say, 'Okay, we need to move resources here. We need to shift resources from here.'" &lt;ref name="HuffPost-Project ORCA" /&gt; The campaign's spokeswoman Andrea Saul told the ''[[Huffington Post]]'' that ORCA would provide Romney with "an enormous advantage ... By knowing the current results of a state, we can continue to adjust and micro target our get-out-the-vote efforts to ensure a Romney victory."&lt;ref name="HuffPost-Project ORCA" /&gt;

According to the campaign, ORCA would identify how between 18 and 23 million people had voted on election day, providing "the most accurate ballot projections ever" and ensuring "hyper-accuracy of our supporter targeting as we work to turn them out to the polls."&lt;ref name="Farber"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.cnet.com/8301-13578_3-57547183-38/why-romneys-orca-killer-app-beached-on-election-day/|title=Why Romney's Orca killer app beached on Election Day|last=Farber|first=|publisher=CNET News|date=November 9, 2012|accessdate=December 2, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a pre-election video, Romney told volunteers: "As part of this task force, you'll be the key link in providing critical, real-time information to me and to the staff so that we can ensure that every last supporter makes it to the polls. With state-of-the-art technology, and an extremely dedicated group of volunteers, our campaign will have an unprecedented advantage on Election Day."&lt;ref name="Kranish"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.boston.com/news/politics/2012/president/candidates/romney/2012/11/10/orca-mitt-romney-high-tech-get-out-the-vote-program-crashed-election-day/gflS8VkzDcJcXCrHoV0nsI/story.html|title=ORCA, Mitt Romney's high-tech get-out-the-vote program, crashed on Election Day|last=Kranish|first=Michael|work=Boston Globe|date=November 9, 2012|accessdate=December 2, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Obama campaign declined to comment on ORCA but Scott Goodstein, the external online director for the 2008 Obama campaign, questioned whether it would actually make much difference to potential voters who were sitting out the election. He commented, "In a national campaign, what additional things are the headquarters really going to do to move resources? Will an additional auto-call last minute really make a difference in a market like Northeast [[Ohio]], which has been saturated for three months full of auto-calls?"&lt;ref name="HuffPost-Project ORCA" /&gt; Some pro-Democrat bloggers expressed concerns that the system would facilitate voter suppression but the ORCA training material emphasized that Romney volunteers should under no circumstances talk to or confront voters.&lt;ref name="HuffPost-Project ORCA" /&gt;

==Development==
The system was initially reported to have been developed by an application consulting firm and Microsoft,&lt;ref name="Ars" /&gt; but later reports attributed its development to "an internal 'skunkworks'" comprising "a makeshift team of IT people and volunteers", rather than an outside consultancy, while a number of small consulting companies helped with the implementation of ORCA during election day.&lt;ref name="Ars which consultants"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2012/11/which-consultants-built-romneys-project-orca-none-of-them/|title=Which consultants built Romney's "Project Orca?" None of them|last=Gallagher|first=Sean|date=November 15, 2012|accessdate=December 2, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to campaign insiders, it was kept secret among "a close circle in Boston" and state officials were not informed of how it would operate until only a few days before the election.&lt;ref name="Haberman"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.politico.com/blogs/burns-haberman/2012/11/romneys-fail-whale-orca-the-votetracker-149098.html|title=Romney's fail whale: ORCA the vote-tracker left team 'flying blind'|last1=Haberman|first1=Maggie|last2=Burns|first2=Alexander|publisher=Politico|date=November 8, 2012|accessdate=December 2, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Volunteer users of ORCA in Boston were given no hands-on training until the day of the election itself, when the system was turned on at 6 am.&lt;ref name="Ars" /&gt;

ORCA was conceived by Rich Beeson, the campaign's political director, and Dan Centinello, Romney's director of voter contact.&lt;ref name="Ars" /&gt; Centinello served as the political manager of the Orca project.&lt;ref name="Ars which consultants" /&gt;

ORCA spending represented only a small portion of the campaign's overall investment in information technology.&lt;ref name="Ars which consultants" /&gt;

==Features and functionality==
ORCA was designed to work on a variety of devices, including [[iPhone]]s and [[iPad]]s, [[Android (operating system)|Android]] phones and tablets and [[BlackBerry]] phones.&lt;ref name="HuffPost-Project ORCA" /&gt;

The system was designed to show the names and addresses of every eligible voter in a particular precinct. When the voter had gone through the polling station, a logged-in volunteer would simply slide a bar on their phone screen to note that fact. If there were any problems in the polling station, such as erroneous voting lists, illegal activities or issues with the voting machines, they could press an on-screen yellow button to send an alert to the campaign's lawyers. A [[Twitter]]-style instant messenger system would also enable volunteers and the campaign to share information in real time. Those without smartphones were also catered for; the Romney campaign would provide a list of voters to enable volunteers to check off individual names and phone the information into the campaign's headquarters.&lt;ref name="HuffPost-Project ORCA" /&gt; The data they gathered would be monitored by 800 volunteers at campaign headquarters on the floor of [[TD Garden]] in Boston via a Web-based application; it would be used to coordinate contacts throughout election day to pro-Romney voters who had not shown up at the polls. As a fallback, a voice response system would also be established, to allow mobile phone users to call in information if the online system was not working.&lt;ref name="Ars" /&gt;

ORCA consisted of 11 back-end [[database server]]s and a single [[web server]] and [[application server]] providing the front end. The servers were said to have all been hosted in [[Boston]].&lt;ref name="Ars"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2012/11/inside-team-romneys-whale-of-an-it-meltdown/|title=Inside Team Romney's whale of an IT meltdown|last=Gallagher|first=Sean|work=Ars Technica|date=November 9, 2012|accessdate=December 2, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Usage==
Throughout election day, volunteers experienced frequent and widespread problems using ORCA,&lt;ref name="Farber" /&gt; which crashed periodically.&lt;ref name="Haberman" /&gt; As volunteers tried to log in, the surge of traffic caused the system to collapse altogether for about an hour and a half, leading to scenes of panic among Romney staffers at the TD Garden. The Romney campaign's digital director, Zac Moffatt, conceded: "The Garden definitely kind of buckled under the strain. The system wasn't ready for the amount of information incoming."&lt;ref name="Kranish" /&gt; The traffic surge was so great that at one point [[Comcast]], the campaign's Internet Service Provider, shut off its network connection in the belief that it was coming under a [[denial of service attack]].&lt;ref name="Ars" /&gt; Reporter Erin McPike tweeted that some suspected that the system had been hacked and that Republican sources had confirmed to her that something had gone wrong.&lt;ref name="Robertson"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theverge.com/2012/11/9/3624636/killer-fail-how-romneys-broken-orca-app-cost-him-thousands-of-votes|title=Killer fail: how Romney's broken Orca app cost him thousands of votes|last=Robertson|first=Adi|work=The Verge|date=November 9, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; One Romney aide commented that "ORCA is lying on the beach with a harpoon in it."&lt;ref name="Farber" /&gt;
[[File:TDCenter1.jpg|right|thumb|The floor of TD Garden in Boston, where the Romney campaign headquarters volunteers tried to make ORCA work on election day]]
John Ekdahl Jr., a Romney volunteer and web developer in [[Jacksonville, Florida]], wrote a widely discussed account of his experiences with ORCA. The Romney campaign had sent him a 60-page document listing voters and instructions the day before the election, which he struggled to print, but when he reached his local polling station on election day he was told that he needed a certificate to be allowed to work there. The certification was not mentioned in his documentation and his attempts to reach campaign headquarters got nowhere, causing him to give up by 2 pm. Calling ORCA "an unmitigated disaster," Ekdahl said that he was "hearing almost universal condemnation of the thing. It seemed like the basic coordination between ground ops and overall team was lacking."&lt;ref name="Kranish" /&gt; Ekdahl also called the training manuals vague and uninformative; ORCA was regularly described as an "app", leading to volunteers looking unsuccessfully for it on the iOS [[App Store (iOS)|App Store]] and [[Google Play]]. In fact, it was a web application, a mobile-enabled website that did not require  additional software to use.&lt;ref name="Kranish" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Robertson" /&gt; The training materials were also riddled with errors such as duplicate checklist items and erroneous responses to frequently asked questions. ORCA exclusively used an [[HTTP Secure]] (HTTPS) connection but its designers had apparently forgotten to redirect those attempting to use the equivalent HTTP address to the HTTPS address. Anyone who incorrectly typed in an address beginning with "www" was unable to reach the system, causing many volunteers to assume that it was down.&lt;ref name="Robertson" /&gt;

Other volunteers reported being unable to get through to technical support and found themselves receiving either a busy signal or a "try again later" message. One volunteer wrote on a Romney campaign message board: "I have called the ORCA helpline. It was supposed to be live at 5 a.m. ... still getting a recording. Com [''[[sic]]''] on Boston we can't help Mitt if you won't help us.!!!!!"&lt;ref name="Kranish" /&gt; Many volunteers could not get their security PINs to work. According to a campaign official in Colorado, "we were called by hundreds (or more) volunteers who couldn't use the app or the backup phone system. The usernames and passwords were wrong, but the reset password tool didn't work, and we couldn't change phone PINs. We were told the problems were limited and asked to project confidence, have people use pencil and paper, and try to submit again later. Then at 6 p.m. they admitted they had issued the wrong PINs to every volunteer in [[Colorado]], and reissued new PINS (which also didn't work)."&lt;ref name="Kranish" /&gt; In [[North Carolina]], another campaign official said that "the system went down for a half hour during peak voting, but for hundreds or more, it never worked all day... Many members of our phone bank got up and left."&lt;ref name="Robertson" /&gt; One frustrated volunteer tweeted that it was "a [[wikt:clusterfuck|clusterf**k]]{{sic}}&lt;!--Twitter automatically censors swearwords--&gt; of biblical proportions."&lt;ref name="Robertson" /&gt;

==Impact and post-mortems==

Ekdahl described the effect of ORCA as being that "30,000+ of the most active and fired-up volunteers were wandering around confused and frustrated when they could have been doing anything else to help, like driving people to the polls, phone-banking, walking door-to-door, etc."&lt;ref name="Falcone"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://abcnews.go.com/blogs/politics/2012/11/romney-campaign-acknowledges-high-tech-election-day-monitoring-system-had-its-challenges/|title=Romney Campaign Acknowledges High-Tech Election Day Monitoring System 'Had Its Challenges'|last=Falcone|first=Michael|publisher=ABC News|date=November 10, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Campaign workers were left "flying blind", as several put it, unable to identify non-voters or precincts which needed a last-minute robocalling campaign to drive up turnout. The targeted information promised by the campaign did not materialize and only the generic raw vote tallies were available in key areas.&lt;ref name="Haberman" /&gt; According to the ''Washington Examiner'', by late afternoon on election day ORCA was still predicting a Romney victory with somewhere between 290–300 electoral college votes – nearly 100 more than Romney actually received.&lt;ref name="Farber" /&gt; A Romney campaign official told [[ABC News]], which predicted on the eve of the election that Obama would win by a 50%–47% margin,&lt;ref name="Langer"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://abcnews.go.com/blogs/politics/2012/11/a-slim-edge-opens-for-obama-as-the-closest-contest-concludes/|title=A Slim Edge Opens for Obama As the Closest Contest Concludes|last=Langer|first=Gary|publisher=ABC News|date=November 5, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; "Your numbers don't matter to us."&lt;ref name="Falcone" /&gt; Without accurate information from ORCA, Republican officials instead turned to using public news sources or calling counties for information on the outcome of votes in those areas.&lt;ref name="Haberman" /&gt;

Moffatt acknowledged that "without a doubt, ORCA had its challenges"&lt;ref name="Mullis"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.npr.org/blogs/alltechconsidered/2012/11/10/164869691/on-election-day-romneys-killer-whale-couldnt-stay-afloat|title=On Election Day, Romney's Killer Whale 'App' Couldn't Stay Afloat|last=Mullis|first=Steve|publisher=NPR|date=November 10, 2012|accessdate=December 2, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; but argued that the system had actually worked, despite the reports of problems: "We don't think Orca's problems had a material impact on the campaign, it was not election determinative. We had 30,000 plus volunteers across the country putting information into the system. We had 91 percent of all counties report into the system, 14.3 million voters were accounted for as having voted, and we received 5,397 reports on voting issues, such as instances where they ran out of ballots. The information came in, so you can't say it didn't work. You run into issues because it's so massive in scale."&lt;ref name="Farber" /&gt; He noted that the Romney campaign had had only six months to develop its system, whereas Obama had the benefit of six years of preparation.&lt;ref name="Farber" /&gt; Another Romney aide told ''National Review's'' Katrina Trinko that in fact ORCA's problems had "no relation to the outcome. We achieved in a large part what we set out to do in the swing states in terms of our electorate. The reality is the President did what he said he was going to do. The Obama campaign said that they were going to increase turnout from 2008, and they were able to do that. And that had nothing to do with a reporting system on Election Day."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.nationalreview.com/corner/333139/romney-camp-pushes-back-orca-claims-katrina-trinko|title=Romney Camp Pushes Back on Orca Claims|last=Trinko|first=Katrina|work=National Review|date=November 9, 2012|accessdate=December 2, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Conservative writer Joel B. Pollak suggested that ORCA had ended up suppressing Romney's own vote by tying up campaign volunteers at a critical time. He noted the narrow margin in the key swing states – only some 500,000 to 700,000 votes – and calculated that if each of the 37,000 ORCA volunteers had brought 20 voters to the polls in those states, the gap could have been closed.&lt;ref name="Finley"&gt;{{cite news|title=Fail Whale Leaps From Twitter, Lands on Mitt Romney|url=https://www.wired.com/wiredenterprise/2012/11/project-orca/|last=Finley|first=Klint|work=Wired|date=November 9, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ekdahl saw a "bitter irony" in the fact that "a supposedly small government candidate gutted the local structure of GOTV efforts in favor of a centralized, faceless organization in a far off place (in this case, their Boston headquarters)."&lt;ref name="Finley" /&gt; [[Erick Erickson]] of [[RedState.com]] compared the system to [[Shamu]], a 1970s [[SeaWorld]] orca, "because it bit the leg of the campaign and wouldn't let go." While political scientists doubted that its failure had made much of a difference to the outcome, they suggested that if it had worked properly it could have resulted in a closer election. Lara Brown of [[Villanova University]] said that it was likely that ORCA had "had a substantial effect" on the turnout, particularly in rural counties of [[Ohio]] where Romney had underperformed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.buffalonews.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20121121/CITYANDREGION/121129878/1010|title=WNY native blamed for failed get-out-the-vote app that some tie to Romney's loss|work=The Buffalo News|last=Zremsky|first=Jerry|date=November 21, 2012|accessdate=December 2, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ORCA system had not received extensive [[beta testing]] before election day, nor did the campaign know how it would interact with the data infrastructure in the TD Garden until the day itself.&lt;ref name="Falcone" /&gt; Ekdahl said that he had raised concerns about the lack of testing beforehand. He had asked whether it had been stress tested, whether redundancy had been put in place and whether steps had been taken to combat an external attack on the system, but "these types of questions were brushed aside (truth be told, they never took one of my questions). They assured us that the system had been relentlessly tested and would be a tremendous success."&lt;ref name="Mullis" /&gt; Moffatt admitted that the system had been "beta-tested in a different environment ... There was so much data coming in – 1200 records or more per minute – it shut down the system for a time. Users were frustrated by lag, and some people dropped off and we experienced attrition as a result."&lt;ref name="Farber" /&gt;

[[Robert X. Cringely]], writing in [[InfoWorld]], concluded that "everything in the Orca rollout went great, except for a failure to do any quality assurance, proof its documentation, or beta test in the seven months from conception to implementation. Whoever was behind Orca apparently also failed to hire a competent Web designer, anticipate server loads, beef up its bandwidth, or notify its ISP to expect a bump in traffic."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.infoworld.com/t/cringely/unleashed-project-orca-the-campaign-killer-whale-206782|title=Unleashed! Project Orca, the campaign killer whale|last=Cringely|first=Robert X.|work=InfoWorld|date=November 9, 2012|accessdate=December 2, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sean Gallagher of Ars Technica commented that the key failure was the dependency on automated testing rigs, which "can't show what the system's performance will look like to the end user. And whatever testing environment Romney's campaign team and IT consultants used, it wasn't one that mimicked the conditions of Election Day. As a result, Orca's launch on Election Day was essentially a beta test of the software – not something most IT organizations would do in such a high-stakes environment."&lt;ref name="Ars" /&gt;

''Slate'' writer Sasha Issenberg argued that the problems ran far deeper than ORCA's technical failings, as the Romney campaign had been left behind by the cutting edge of [[data science]]. He noted that while a system like ORCA could not have changed the demographics, data science did make a great difference to the ability of the two campaigns to target and mobilize their voters. As he put it, "The Democrats have it and the Republicans don't." He suggested that ORCA's ability to affect the outcome had been over-hyped by the Romney campaign, as there was only so much that could be done on election day itself: "On short notice, you can send robocalls, reorder a call list and employ paid phone banks, but you are not radically changing the shape of the electorate. They acted like they had invented the wheel, but really all it would have been was a slightly better tread on the tire."&lt;ref name="Farber" /&gt;

'''Otto-Ernst Flick''' (1916-1974) was the oldest of three sons born to Marie and [[Friedrich Flick]] in 1916 in Germany. He entered the Friedrich Flick Industry Holding Company in 1953, but had a fall-out with his father in about 1960. Otto-Ernst took his father to court to secure his inheritance, and after a prolonged struggle, received a payment for settlement. He retired in Düsseldorf and died 1974. His surviving brother, [[Friedrich Karl Flick]] gained full control of the business after he paid out the children of Otto-Ernst.

{{Wikinews|An interview with Paul Campbell, founder of Amazing Radio UK}}

'''Paul Andrew Campbell''' (born 1959) is a British entrepreneur and musician. He is the founder of amazing, the [[digital media]] brand, and CEO of Amazing Media, operator of amazingtunes.com and Amazing Radio.

==Education==
Campbell was born in north-east England and educated at [[RGS Newcastle]] and [[New College, Oxford]], where he read English Literature.

==Early career==
Campbell started his media career as a BBC General Trainee in 1980. He became a Producer of File on 4, the BBC Radio 4 current affairs programme, in 1982. After producing BBC Television programmes such as [[Russell Harty]] and [[Brass Tacks (BBC TV series)|Brass Tacks]], he left the BBC to freelance as a TV Producer with Diverse Production and then [[Zenith Productions]] in 1987.

In 1989 he founded Bell Television, a London-based television production company which made programmes for [[Sky (UK and Ireland)|Sky Television]] and [[Channel 4]]. Bell diversified into radio, commercials, corporate films and new media, building its first website for [[The Barbican Centre]] in 1992. It was an early adopter of desktop digital production techniques to deliver content across multiple platforms.

During the [[dot-com bubble]] Bell focused entirely on new media, working for clients such as [[Granada Television]], [[Goldman Sachs]], [[JP Morgan]] and [[UBS Warburg]]&lt;ref name="Bell Media"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mediaweek.co.uk/news/133123/Bell-Media-sheds-12-London-staff/ |title=Bell Media sheds 12 London staff|date=11 June 2001|accessdate=11 June 2001|publisher=Media Week}}&lt;/ref&gt; from offices in [[Carnaby Street]], London and New York. In 2002 Campbell re-located to north-east England&lt;ref name="The Good Life"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/business/3109535.stm#paul|title=Striking Gold on the Tyne|date=4 August 2003|accessdate=4 August 2003|publisher=BBC}}&lt;/ref&gt; and co-founded [[Liberty Bell Productions]]&lt;ref name="Liberty Bell"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://icnewcastle.icnetwork.co.uk/0100news/0100local/page.cfm?objectid=12307758&amp;method=full&amp;siteid=50081 |title=Liberty Bell declares a war on independents|date=24 October 2002|accessdate=24 October 2002|publisher=ncjMedia}}&lt;/ref&gt; (the TV company which produces [[Grumpy Old Men (TV series)|Grumpy Old Men]] for the BBC) with former ITV CEO [[Stuart Prebble]]&lt;ref name="Prebble"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/2002/oct/24/broadcasting|title=Prebble takes post at Liberty Bell|date=24 October 2002|accessdate=24 October 2002|publisher=The Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[The Tube (TV series)|The Tube]] creator [[Andrea Wonfor]]. In 2003 he founded 'amazing'.

==Amazing==
amazing started life as an educational software company, producer of the study website Amazing Grades and other online products for 14–19-year-old students. Amazing Grades was designed to speed the process of using the internet for students, combining web search results with expert input from teachers at leading British schools in both the private and state-maintained sector.&lt;ref name="Amazing Grades"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://amazing-grades.com/corporate.aspx|title=Welcome to Amazing Grades|date=29 November 2011|accessdate=29 November 2011|publisher=Amazing Learning Ltd}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2005, looking for ways to extend the amazing brand, Campbell conceived the idea of amazingtunes.com while reading a biography of [[Steve Jobs]]. The concept combined his digital media and music experience and was designed to re-shape the music industry with an ethical business model which rewarded musicians fairly for their work. 'amazingtunes.com' launched as a beta website in 2006.&lt;ref name="Amazing Tunes Launches"&gt;{{cite web|url=

==Reception==
''[[Next Generation (magazine)|Next Generation]]'' reviewed the PC version of the game, rating it four stars out of five, and stated that "Looking at the mind-boggling array of charts and graphs in the game will provide some answers, but when all is said and done, making those decisions is up to you, and that's where the real fun in this economic simulation lies."&lt;ref name="NG"&gt;{{cite magazine|last=|first=|title=Finals|magazine=[[Next Generation (magazine)|Next Generation]]|issue=10|publisher=[[Future US|Imagine Media]]|date=October 1995|page=119}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1929">A '''pre-mortem''' — also known as a '''premortem''' — is a [[Management|managerial strategy]] in which a project team imagines that a project or organization has failed, and then works backward to determine what potentially could lead to the failure of the project or organization.&lt;ref name="hbr"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Klein, G. |title=Performing a Project Premortem |journal=Harvard Business Review |volume=85 |issue=9 |pages=18–19 |year=2007|url=https://hbr.org/2007/09/performing-a-project-premortem}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=[[Daniel Kahneman|Kahneman, D.]] |title=Thinking, Fast and Slow |publisher=Farrar, Straus and Giroux |year=2011 |isbn=978-0374275631}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The technique breaks possible [[Groupthink|groupthinking]] by facilitating a positive discussion on threats, increasing the likelihood the main threats are identified. Management can then reduce the chances of failure due to [[Heuristics in judgment and decision-making|heuristics]] and [[cognitive bias|biases]] such as [[overconfidence effect|overconfidence]] and [[planning fallacy]] by analyzing the magnitude and likelihood of each threat, and take preventative actions to protect the project or organization from suffering an untimely "death".

According to a [[Harvard Business Review]] article from 2007, "unlike a typical critiquing session, in which project team members are asked what ''might'' go wrong, the premortem operates on the assumption that the 'patient' has died, and so asks what ''did'' go wrong."&lt;ref name="hbr" /&gt;

The pre-mortem analysis seeks to identify threats and weaknesses via the hypothetical presumption of near-future failure. But if that presumption is incorrect, then the analysis may be identifying threats/weaknesses that are not in fact real.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5147">The '''Reward Work Act''' of 2018 ([https://www.congress.gov/bill/115th-congress/senate-bill/2605/text S.2605] and [https://www.govtrack.us/congress/bills/115/hr6096 HR 6096]) is a proposed United States [[Act of Congress]] to ban unjustified stock buy-backs, and to require every listed company enable employees to elect one-third of the [[board of directors]]. The Bill was sponsored initially by Senators [[Tammy Baldwin]], [[Elizabeth Warren]] and [[Brian Schatz]] in March 2018, and joined in April 2018 by [[Kirsten Gillibrand]]. It was sponsored in the [[United States House of Representatives|House of Representatives]] in June 2018 by [[Keith Ellison]] and [[Ro Khanna]].

==Contents==
Section 2 prohibits stock buybacks on the open market.

Section 3 requires one-third board representation for employees of listed companies. Specifically, this amends §12b of the [[Securities Exchange Act of 1934]] (15 USC 78l(b)(1)) to add "No issuer may register securities on a national exchange unless at least 1⁄3 of the issuer’s directors are chosen by the issuing company’s employees in a one-employee-one-vote election process." It then requires the [[Securities and Exchange Commission]], consulting with the [[National Labor Relations Board]] to make regulations ensuring democratic election processes, and 1/3 of an issuer's board to "be composed of employee representatives within 2 years of the date of enactment of this Act."

==Reception==
The problem of stock buybacks as a source of US income inequality had become highly visible as a result of the award-winning 2014 publication of the ''Harvard Business Review'' article, "Profits Without Prosperity: Stock Buybacks Manipulate the Market and Leave Most Americans Worse Off," by [[William Lazonick]].&lt;ref&gt;William Lazonick, "Profits Without Prosperity" ''Harvard Business Review'', September 2014: 46-55 [https://hbr.org/search?term=william+lazonick]&lt;/ref&gt; The Act was welcomed by the [[Roosevelt Institute]],&lt;ref&gt;'STATEMENT: Financial Economy Experts at Roosevelt Institute React to Bill Introduced by Senator Tammy Baldwin (D-WI) to Ban Stock Buybacks' (22 March 2018) [http://rooseveltinstitute.org/statement-financial-economy-experts-roosevelt-institute-react-bill-introduced-by-senator-tammy-baldwin-d-wi-ban-stock-buybacks/ Roosevelt Institute]&lt;/ref&gt; and media outlets.&lt;ref&gt;e.g. D Matthews, 'Workers don’t have much say in corporations.

*[[AFL-CIO]]
*[[Communication Workers of America]]
*[[Public Citizen]]
*[[Take on Wall Street]]
*[[Americans for Financial Reform]]

A Civis poll found people in "the “lean Democrat” category voted 75% in favor of the question, and just 9% opposed. Around 43% of the “lean Republican” category supported the concept, while 31% opposed, and the pure Republican category saw 4% more opposed than in favor. But overall, a clear majority of people favor the concept."&lt;ref&gt;E Anzelotti, 'Want Fairer Workplaces?

'''Rolf Dobelli''' (born July 15, 1966 in [[Luzern]], Switzerland&lt;ref&gt;http://www.goodreads.com/author/show/695505.Rolf_Dobelli&lt;/ref&gt;) is a [[Swiss people|Swiss]] author and businessman.
He began his writing career as a novelist in 2002, but he is best known internationally for his bestselling non-fiction ''[[The Art of Thinking Clearly]]'' (2011, English 2013), for which [[The Times]] has called him "the self-help guru the Germans love".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thetimes.co.uk/tto/life/article3791190.ece The Times, June 2013]&lt;/ref&gt;

Born in 1966 in [[Lucerne]], Switzerland, he obtained an [[MBA]] in 1991 from the [[University of St. Gallen]] and a  [[PhD]] in [[economic philosophy]] in 1995. In 1999, he co-founded [[getAbstract]], a publisher of book summaries and article abstracts.

In 2003, [[Diogenes Verlag]] (Switzerland) published his first [[novel]], ''Fünfunddreissig'' ("Thirty-five"), followed by  ''Und was machen Sie beruflich?'' ("And What Do You Do for a Living?") in 2004, ''Himmelreich'' (The Heavens) in 2006, ''Wer bin ich?'' ("Who am I?") and ''Turbulenzen'' ("Turbulence") in 2007 and ''Massimo Marini'' in 2010. 
The major themes in Dobelli's novels are the meaning of success and the role of [[randomness]] in business and in life.

Dobelli is the author of ''[[The Art of Thinking Clearly]]'' (''Die Kunst des klaren Denkens''), originally published by [[Carl Hanser Verlag]] in 2011, which was an instant success, entering Germany's [[Der Spiegel]] Bestseller list as number 1.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.buchreport.de/bestseller/hardcover/bestseller/4.htm Der Spiegel Bestseller List, 12 Jan 2012] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080731040023/http://www.buchreport.de/bestseller/hardcover/bestseller/4.htm |date=2008-07-31 }}&lt;/ref&gt; 
It was the bestselling non-fiction book in Germany and Switzerland in 2012.&lt;ref&gt;[[Der Spiegel]] print edition 1/2013 p. 121&lt;/ref&gt; It was translated into English in 2013 and hit the top ten bestseller lists in the U.K,&lt;ref&gt;[[The Times]] bestseller list hardback non-fiction, 21 April 2013&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The Sunday Times bestseller list 7 July 2013 (rank number 4)&lt;/ref&gt; South Korea, India,&lt;ref&gt;[Crossword book retailer's bestseller list June 2013]&lt;/ref&gt; Ireland,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.writing.ie/news/irish-bestsellers-this-week/ Writing.IE Bestseller List, 14 June 2013]&lt;/ref&gt; Hong Kong and Singapore.&lt;ref&gt;[[The Straits Times]] bestseller list non-fiction, 28 April 2013&lt;/ref&gt;
''The Art of Thinking Clearly'' was attacked by [[Nassim Nicholas Taleb]] and [[Christopher Chabris]] for [[plagiarism]].&lt;ref&gt;Guido Kalberer, [www.tagesanzeiger.ch/kultur/buecher/Nassim-Taleb-attackiert-Rolf-Dobelli/story/11573752  Nassim Taleb attackiert Rolf Dobelli], [[Tages-Anzeiger]], 12 September 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.fooledbyrandomness.com/dobelli.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-09-14 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160202004155/http://www.fooledbyrandomness.com/dobelli.htm |archivedate=2016-02-02 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Christopher Chabris]] has published an example in Dobelli's book that is referenced but does not have quotation marks, and four paragraphs in the notes/references section (unprinted in most editions) without the formally required proper credit.

Artioli was born in [[Moglia]] in the [[Province of Mantua]], and raised in [[Bolzano]] where in the 1980s he ran one of the largest [[Ferrari]] dealerships in the world, selling in northern Italy and southern Germany.&lt;ref&gt;See [[Automobile Quarterly]], vol. 46, issue 2 (2006)&lt;/ref&gt;
He also imported Japanese cars, owning ''Autoexpò'' which in 1982 became the first Italian importer of [[Suzuki]].&lt;ref&gt;Maurizio Caldero, ''Buon compleanno Suzuki: da 25 anni anche in Italia'' in [[La Repubblica]] (June 7, 2007).&lt;/ref&gt;  

He had a large collection of Bugatti automobiles,{{Citation needed|date=August 2009}}
and was encouraged by [[Ferruccio Lamborghini]] and Paolo Stanzani to establish ''Bugatti International'', a holding company that bought the Bugatti trademark name in 1987.
Artioli became chairman of [[Bugatti#Bugatti Automobili S.p.A.|Bugatti Automobili S.p.A.]], which made the [[Bugatti EB 110]] between 1991 and 1995.
In 1993, his wife Renata Kettmeir formed the [[Bolzano]]-based ''Ettore Bugatti'' luxury item maker, also using the Bugatti "EB" logo. Their involvement ended in September 1995 due to [[bankruptcy]],&lt;ref&gt;John Tagliabue, ''Hard Times for a Dream Car's Descendant'' in ''[[New York Times]]'' (November 23, 1995)&lt;/ref&gt; and the company was eventually bought by [[Volkswagen]] in April 1998. Prior to the sale to Volkswagen, private equity Investor CVC Ventures (a Citibank company) attempted a purchase of Bugatti via UK corporate finance advisor Anglo American Ventures however the £100m deal failed at due diligence stage.

Artioli purchased [[Lotus (car)|Lotus]] from [[General Motors Corporation|General Motors]] in August 1993 and became its chairman until 1996 when he stepped down to be Special Projects director until 1998. 
He sold a majority stake to [[Proton (car)|Proton]] in 1996 to fund his losses due to the insolvency of Bugatti.

His daughter [[Elena Artioli]] (born 1970) is a politician for the [[South Tyrolean People's Party]] and
[[Lega Nord Alto Adige – Südtirol]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.elenaartioli.com/ elenaartioli.com] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091011100544/http://www.elenaartioli.com/ |date=2009-10-11 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
The [[Lotus Elise]] was named after Romano Artioli's granddaughter Elisa Artioli.

[[File:Bolsa de Comercio Rosario 1.jpg|thumb|The original Rosario Stock Exchange]] 
The '''Rosario Board of Trade''' ({{lang-es|'''Bolsa de Comercio de Rosario'''}}, ''BCR'') is a non-profit making association based in [[Rosario]], in the [[provinces of Argentina|Province]] of [[Santa Fe Province|Santa Fe]], [[Argentina]]. Founded on August 18, 1884, it serves as a forum for the conduct of trade negotiations in several markets including grain, oilseed, agricultural products and their by-products, as well as securities and other assets.

== Grain Market ==
The Physical Grain Market (''{{lang|es|Mercado Físico de Granos}}'') of the BCR is the most important in Argentina in terms of its volume of operations, and provides reference prices for the national and international markets. Most of the country's production of [[cereal]]s and [[Vegetable fats and oils|oilseeds]] is traded within it, especially [[soybean]]. The [[Greater Rosario|region]] around Rosario contains more than 80% of the vegetable oil industry of Argentina and its ports, ([[Port of Rosario|Rosario]] and [[San Lorenzo-Puerto General San Martín Port Complex|San Lorenzo-Puerto San Martín]]), handle more than 90% of the Argentine export of soybean and its derivatives.
The Board of Trade additionally operates a complex of laboratories which analyze and provide quality certifications for samples of agricultural products, soil and water.

== Futures Exchange {{anchor|Rosario Futures Exchange}} ==
The Rosario Futures Exchange (ROFEX, ''{{lang|es|Mercado a Término de Rosario}}'') has traditionally been a [[futures exchange]] for [[commodities]] and, in more recent times, for financial products such as [[exchange rate]] and [[interest rate]] options. Its negotiated volume (especially in [[forward contract]]s over [[United States dollar|dollars]]) makes ROFEX the largest futures market in the country.

== Stock Exchange {{anchor|Rosario Stock Exchange}} ==
The Rosario Stock Exchange (''{{lang|es|Mercado de Valores de Rosario}}'', abbreviated MerVaRos) is known as ''{{lang|es|Mercado Argentino de Valores}}'', after the merger with the Mendoza Stock Exchange.

== Livestock Market ==
The Rosario Livestock Market (''{{lang|es|Mercado [[wikt:ganadero|Ganadero]] de Rosario}}'', abbreviated Rosgan) is an important Argentine livestock auction market, notably for [[cattle]].&lt;ref&gt;Official site of [http://www.rosgannet.com.ar/ingles Rosgan] (livestock auction market)&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
Operating in a landmark [[Beaux-Arts architecture|Beaux-Arts]] headquarters designed by Raúl Rivero in 1926, the exchange had new offices built during the 1990s. Designed by architect [[Mario Roberto Álvarez]], the new building was completed in 1998.

'''Samuel Beníquez Méndez''' was born on October 28, 1971, at Doctors' Center Hospital in Santurce, [[San Juan, Puerto Rico]]. His biological mother is Antonia Beníquez Seguí. He was adopted by his maternal uncle and aunt, Félix Beníquez Quiñones and Ada Méndez Castro, on February 21, 1973.

However, Samuel Beníquez’s biological mother, Antonia Beníquez Seguí, remained in the Beníquez–Méndez family home, taking care of her son as if she were his nanny. Beníquez Méndez grew up believing this lie and was indoctrinated in the [[Mita Congregation|Congregación Mita]] religion, which was founded in Puerto Rico and is now established in several parts of the world.

Beníquez Méndez has studied music since age six and excels on instruments such as the clarinet, flute, and saxophone. He was a member of Mita Congregation’s wind band until 1995 and received a scholarship to study music at the University of Puerto Rico, Río Piedras campus.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.samuelbeniquez.net Official Webite of Samuel Beniquez"]&lt;/ref&gt;

About thirty years later, on May 13, 2003, Beníquez Méndez and his mother, Beníquez Seguí, filed a motion before the Court of First Instance to nullify the adoption. They largely argued that Beníquez Seguí was coerced and intimidated by the Beníquez–Méndez couple to consent to the adoption of her son. Consequently, they alleged that her consent was unlawful, which rendered the resolution issued February 21, 1973, null and void. Unlawful consent deprives the Court of jurisdiction, making the resolution issued nonexistent.

The petitioners also argued that Beníquez Méndez was raised by his mother from birth and even moved with her at the age of six to live at a residence other than that of his aunt and uncle. Furthermore, they added that the Beníquez–Méndez couple only sought to adopt the minor in order to financially profit off a child they supposedly never raised.

On September 13, 2003, the Court of First Instance overruled the petitioners’ motion with an unsubstantiated resolution. This decision was never appealed or revised, becoming final and enforceable.

Later, on November 4, 2004, Beníquez Seguí and Beníquez Méndez filed a second claim regarding nullity of adoption procedures and declaration of filiation in which the petitioners alleged that Beníquez Seguí, when she was still pregnant with Beníquez Méndez, was coerced, threatened, and subjected to “mental, moral, emotional, and religious pressures” to give her consent for the Beníquez-Méndez couple to adopt her son.

Separately from what they alleged in their first motion, the petitioners also argued that the pattern of coercion and intimidation in question was because Mr. [[Teófilo Vargas Seín]], spiritual leader of the Mita Congregation religion, was the biological father of Beníquez Méndez and that the aunt and uncle – together with other people from the congregation – orchestrated the adoption in question in order to hide that fact. In agreement with the above, they requested that the adoption under examination be ruled null and that the Demographic Registrar be ordered to register Beníquez Méndez as the biological son of Beníquez Seguí and Vargas Seín.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.lexjuris.com/lexjuris/tspr2012/lexj2012002.htm#_ftnref10 2012 Jurisprudencia del Tribunal Supremo de P.R. del año 2012 | 2012 DTS 002 BENIQUEZ MENDEZ V. VARGAS SEIN Y OTROS, 2012TSPR002"]&lt;/ref&gt;

The legal case spent nearly 10 years in court and even reached the [[Puerto Rico Supreme Court]], concluding in a resolution by the Supreme Court ordering that the proceedings of the case be continued and that Teófilo Vargas Seín, better known as Aarón, forcibly recognize the filiation, thus granting Samuel Beníquez Méndez the right to know his true paternal filiation.

As such, Aarón was officially summoned to appear at the Histocompatibility Institute of the Medical Sciences Campus of the University of Puerto Rico on March 11, 2013, at 8:00&amp;nbsp;a.m. to take a DNA test together with Samuel Beníquez Méndez and Antonia Beníquez Seguí.

The parties, including Samuel Beníquez Méndez, his vilified mother, Antonia Beníquez Seguí, and the lawyer who had brought the paternity suit for 10 years, Nicolás Nogueras, were summoned to the Court of San Juan to hear the reading of the DNA test on March 25, 2013, by Judge Arlene Sellés Guerrini.

The laboratory results reflected a 99.9999 percent chance that Aarón is Samuel Beníquez Méndez’s biological father. Beníquez Méndez, at the age of 41 years, celebrated that he had a father, named Aarón, and that his mother was vindicated.&lt;ref&gt;News published in the Puerto Rican newspaper ''El Nuevo Dia''[https://www.elnuevodia.com/noticias/locales/nota/eladnconfirmalapaternidaddeaaron-1477992/# El Nuevo Dia article]&lt;/ref&gt;

However, Teófilo Vargas Seín, the top leader of the Mita Congregation, “left” the case and to this day, has never wanted to establish a relationship of friendship, love, spirituality, or fatherhood with his biological son, Samuel.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.samuelbeniquez.net Official Website of Samuel Beniquez]&lt;/ref&gt;

Samuel Beníquez Méndez, CEO of AVFA,&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.avfa.net Official Website of AVFA"]&lt;/ref&gt; got his start by working at a computer center at a very young age. Beníquez Méndez was 16 years old and still in high school when he began working as a data processor at the Government of Puerto Rico’s General Services Administration’s Computer Center, the only teenager hired at that time and on a night shift. At age 18, following the example set by his father, he began working at the Hermanos Unidos Savings and Credit Cooperative in Hato Rey, San Jose, Puerto Rico.

He held a number of positions in that line of work within the organization until he decided to work independently as an insurance and investment agent with the company Primerica Financial Services (formerly part of Citigroup), becoming a regional vice president while he attended the Interamerican University of Puerto Rico, where he received his Bachelor’s in Business Administration with a Concentration in Marketing. Meanwhile, he learned a lot about insurance and investments surrounded by qualified people with extensive knowledge in the field.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.samuelbeniquez.net/negocios/ Official Website of Samuel Beniquez"]&lt;/ref&gt;

Beníquez Méndez had always intended to build a career and after succeeding, start his own company. He therefore founded the financial institution First Home Financial with his brother Samuel Ortiz in 1995, which has locations in several towns in Puerto Rico and the US state of Pennsylvania. He held the position of CEO of the bank and Chairman of the Board of Directors of the corporation. Following this, he was the CEO of successful companies such as ER Remodeling &amp; Construction Co., Imperial Music Studio, Imperial College, Black Dot Records, BD Authors, Imperial Recording Studios, and Imperial Artists, among others, while he continued his studies at SMC University. As CEO of these companies, in addition to administration, he was also directly involved in marketing and media relations.

His exciting career in the corporate world since he was young has provided him with important experiences in administration, marketing, communications, and the responsibility of being in charge of the losses and earnings of different companies.

Today, Beníquez Méndez is the CEO of AVFA Firm LLC, a leading company in Puerto Rico, the Caribbean, and the continental United States. The company offers public relations services, strategic communications, copywriting, media services, interactive services, and business advice to all types of companies.

Since taking the reins of the company, Beníquez Méndez has worked to expand and position it for success in the 21st century, focusing on growth and new business areas. Its portfolio focuses on protecting the company from taking too many risks while maximizing its opportunities for growth.

Just like how he learned when he was young, Beníquez Méndez has surrounded himself with talented and knowledgeable people. Additionally, he has simplified the organization and promotes a team approach to solving problems and determining a long-term strategic direction. Beníquez Méndez has also given employees a system of policies and values and encouraged them to live the company’s mission and vision, where professionalism and excellent service are the most important.

==Music and Writing==

Beníquez Méndez is the cowriter and composer (with Samuel Ortiz) of songs such as "Histeria," "Dame de ti," "Inevitable," "Todo fue por," and "Si a ti te gusta," as well as another 24 sets of lyrics and musical pieces. Also in collaboration with Samuel Ortiz, he produced the albums Histeriha and Off Da’ Hook, winning the Paoli Award for Best New Artist in 2002. In 2005, the songs off his album Off Da' Hook were again distributed on the world market under the label Critique, this time on the album Viper Boyz, sharing credits with artists as big as Lil Jon &amp; the East Side Boyz, D-Roc, DJ Smurf, Kaine, Los TNT, and Ludacris.

Their achievements led to them becoming voting members of the Recording Academy and the Latin Recording Academy, and in 2012, he received a recognition reading “In acknowledgment and recognition of 10 years of membership, and for supporting the Recording Academy’s mission of improving the climate for music and the lives of all the members of our creative community.” The recognition was signed by the Chairman of the Board of Trustees, George Flanigen IV, and the president/CEO, Neil Portnow.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.instagram.com/p/TcO4csJsLt/?taken-by=samuelbeniquez Certificate of recognition from The Recording Academy to Samuel Beniquez]&lt;/ref&gt;

Additionally, under the pseudonym Miguel Amadeus, he wrote the bestselling book Tu alto precio ... Mi gran valor in 2004, and in 2015, he wrote and published his most recent book, El niño versus la bestia, which was displayed on the big screens in Times Square in New York.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.samuelbeniquez.net/musica-y-escritura Information about Music and Writing in the Official Website of Samuel Beniquez]&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1828">Within the context of [[international trade]], a '''social clause''' is the integration of seven core [[ILO]] [[labour rights]] conventions into trade agreements.

==Background==
Core labour standards would be inserted into an article within the [[WTO]] Agreements which could be a more viable option than amendment of the Agreements themselves. If a [[member state]] violated the social clause, the breach could become subject to WTO scrutiny, through the usual WTO dispute settlement provisions (provided provision is made for this when inserting a social clause). As a result of dispute settlement proceedings, the DSB could, at the request of the complaining party, recommend that retaliatory trade measures be taken against the offending country.

* [[Freedom of association]] and [[collective bargaining]] (Conventions 87 and (98);
* Abolition of [[unfree labour|forced labour]] (Convention 29 and 105);

      <comment>Frayae moved page [[Sir William Bilsland]] to [[William Bilsland]]: [[Special:Permalink/851918525|Requested]] by Wikimandia at [[WP:RM/TR]]: "Sir" does not go in the title, per guidelines. "William Bilsland" currently exists as a redirect to [[Billy Bilsland]] but there's no reason to have the redirect as the subject of the second article was clearly known as Billy. "Sir" should not be used for disambiguation.</comment>

'''Sir''' '''William Bilsland''' LLD (17 March 1847&amp;ndash;1921) was a Scottish baker who owned one of Scotland's largest bakeries, and was [[Lord Provost]] of [[Glasgow]]. He was an elder of the [[United Free Church of Scotland]] and a supporter of the [[temperance movement]].

==Life==

He was born on 17 March 1847 at Ballat near [[Balfron]], the son of Ann Blair and James Bilsland, a farmer.&lt;ref&gt;Oxford Dictionary of National Biography: William Bilsland&lt;/ref&gt;

He was educated at Dalmanoch school in [[Bonhill]] living there with his uncle, Dr Alexander Leckie.

From 1860 to 1869 he worked as a grocer's assistant in [[Glasgow]]. In 1869 he opened a shop at 223 Garscube Road.&lt;ref&gt;Glasgow Post Office directory 1872&lt;/ref&gt; In 1872 he opened a bakery in Greenhill Street and also acquired an existing bakery in Elderslie Street.&lt;ref name="gracesguide.co.uk"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.gracesguide.co.uk/Bilsland_Brothers|title=Bilsland Brothers|website=www.gracesguide.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Bilsland Brothers==
[[File:28 Park Circus, Glasgow.jpg|thumb|28 Park Circus, Glasgow]]
In 1877, with his brothers, he bought a large piece of ground on Hydepark Street and on which they built the large Hydepark Bakery, adopting the company name of Bilsland Brothers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.glasgowwestaddress.co.uk/1909_Glasgow_Men/Bilsland_Sir_William.htm|title=Sir William Bilsland|website=www.glasgowwestaddress.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By 1900 they employed 200 people and made 230,000 loaves of bread a week, over 10 million loaves per year. They supplied 1600 retailers. Workers were well-paid, worked a 40 hour maximum week, unusual for the time, and all received free bread.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://great-british.co.uk/wordpress/?p=4598|title=Sir William Bilsland, 1st Bt - Great British - bringing you closer to our history makers|website=great-british.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1912 they acquired the rival company of Gray and Dunn (but retained their name as Gray Dunn &amp; Co).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.balfron.org.uk/balfron-personalities/sir-william-bilsland/|title=Sir William Bilsland – Balfron, Stirlingshire|website=www.balfron.org.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt; The main company was rebranded as Glasgow Bakeries.

The company traded until 1985. The bakery was demolished in 2015.

==Politics==

In 1886 he became a town councillor representing the 13th ward in [[Glasgow]].&lt;ref name="gracesguide.co.uk"/&gt;

In 1905 he was elected [[Lord Provost]], succeeding [[John Ure Primrose]]. He served until 1908 during which time he saw many artistic projects, in particular the [[Kelvingrove Art Gallery and Museum]]. During this period he lived at 28 Park Circus&lt;ref&gt;Glasgow Post Office Directory 1905&lt;/ref&gt; a beautiful, three-storey Georgian circus form, just east of [[Kelvingrove Park]].

In 1907 King [[Edward VII]] created him a baronet, as Sir William Bilsland, Baronet of Park Circus, for his services to Glasgow.&lt;ref&gt;London Gazette 1 January 1907&lt;/ref&gt;

He died on 27 August 1921.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.douglashistory.co.uk/famgen/getperson.php?personID=I169374&amp;tree=tree1|title=Sir William (1st Baronet Bilsland, of Park Circus, Glasgow) Bilsland b. 17 Mar 1847 Ballat, Balfron, Stirllingshire, Scotland d. 27 Aug 1921: The Douglas Archives|website=www.douglashistory.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Family==

Together they had two childrenAgnes Anne (1896-1970) and [[Steven Bilsland]], who inherited the business on his death.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hiddenglasgow.com/forums/viewtopic.php?f=3&amp;t=850|title=The Hidden Glasgow Forums • View topic - Bilsland's Bakery|website=www.hiddenglasgow.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;
