'''Akhat (Alexander) Khafizovich (Sergeevich) Bragin''' ({{lang-uk|Ахать (Олександр) Хафізович (Сергійович) Брагін}}, {{lang-ru|Ахать (Александр) Хафизович (Сергеевич) Брагин}}, {{lang-tt|Әхәт (Александр) Хафиз улы Брагин}}; 1953 — October 15, 1995) was an [[Ukraine|Ukrainian]] businessman of [[Volga Tatars|Volga Tatar]] descent. He was a mafia figure of the [[Donetsk Oblast]] and later the president of the football club [[FC Shakhtar Donetsk|Shakhtar Donetsk]] until his death.

==Biography==
Akhat Hafizovich Bragin was born in 1953 in the [[Kuibyshevskyi Raion]] of [[Donetsk]] city, [[Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic|Ukrainian SSR]]. Before he became the president of [[FC Shakhtar Donetsk|Shakhtar Donetsk]], he was also a [[butcher]] at a local market in Oktyabrsky Raion.

==Education==
Donetsk Institute of Soviet Trading (today Donetsk National University of Economy and Trading), dropout.

==Convictions==
* November 24, 1971 – convicted (the Criminal Code of Ukraine) by the Kuibyshev District Court of Donetsk to a conditional year of imprisonment with correctional term of 2 years without confiscation of property

==Personal life==
Bragin had a wife and two children: Dilyara (1985—2009) and Ravil (b. 1989).

==Assassination and attempts==
An attempt to kill Bragin took place on March 19, 1994, at a settlement called [[Pisky, Yasynuvata Raion|Pisky]] (Bragin's hometown). [[Pisky, Yasynuvata Raion]] is a rural settlement of [[Yasynuvata Raion]], just to the west from the [[Donetsk International Airport]]. A group of bandits from the Ryabin-Kushnir gang (run by Yevhen Kushnir and Anatoliy Ryabi) opened fire on Bragin's pigeon house. Miraculously Akhat Bragin survived the attempt.

Akhat Bragin died in a bomb attack on Sunday, October 15, 1995, at the [[Shakhtar Stadium (Donetsk)|Shakhtar Stadium]] in Donetsk. After this event, the new president and chairman of Shaktar Donetsk became [[Rinat Akhmetov]]. The reason for Akhat's murder was his business dealings. Known in the criminal underworld as 'Alik the Greek', his organization got into conflict with several others. The investigation into his death made little progress until the confession of a rival gangster, which led to the arrest and imprisonment of former policeman Vyacheslav Synenko.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kyivpost.com/content/ukraine/akhat-bragin-31849.html Kyiv Post - Akhat Bragin]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legacy==
In honor of Akhat Bragin, the mosque of Donetsk is called [[Ahat Jami Mosque, Donetsk|Ahat Jami]].

''' Bandini Automobili''' was an [[Italy|Italian]] automobile manufacturer operating between 1946 and 1992. It was named after its founder [[Ilario Bandini]].

Founded in 1946 in Bandini’s hometown [[Forlì]], the first Bandini used a modified [[Fiat 1100 (1937)|Fiat 1100]] engine, the body was made from hand hammered aluminum and the chassis from aviation-grade tubular steel. Many other post-war Italian sports car companies followed a similar design. But Bandini’s sharp mind, racing knowledge and his eye for detail ensured that Bandini cars were a force to be reckoned with in Europe and the US.

Interest in America surged when Bandini Siluros, with their screaming 750-cc engines and wildly flared front fenders, won [[SCCA]] class championships in 1955 and 1957. His slightly modified Crosley engines became famous thanks their [[DOHC]] Bandini heads. Bandini himself continued to race in Italy, including the [[Mille Miglia]], while newer models were being built and developed at the factory. One of these included the new 1957 Sport International [[Bandini_750_sport_internazionale|"Saponetta"]]. It was a two-seat sports car with a tubular steel frame and room for engines of up to 1.0 liter. The design of the car body was very striking. The smooth lines and petite dimensions gave the car the Italian nickname "Saponetta" (little soap). The [[Bandini formula 3|Formula 3]] car of 1954{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}} had disc brakes on all four wheels, following closely on the 1951 [[Jaguar C-Type|C-type Jaguar]]. The [[Zagato]] bodied Bandini GT raced in Daytona and [[12 Hours of Sebring]].  The coupé by Corna was a 1000 cc and the engine was mounted in front.

==Racing history==
{{See also|Ilario Bandini}}

Ilario divided his time between design and manufacturing of the cars, and as a race driver. He entered and drove his cars in more than 60 races, both [[Hillclimbing|hillclimb]] events and track racing, including the Mille Miglia from 1947 until 1965, achieving 19 first-place finishes and 18 podiums in the 750cc and 1000cc classes.

In the United States, Bandini cars won the [[SCCA]] HM class championship in 1955&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ferrariexperts.com/SCCA%20results%201955.htm#SCC|title=SCCA Results 1955|accessdate=1 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; thanks to driver Dolph Vilardi.  In 1957 Melvin Sachs won the HM class,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ferrariexperts.com/SCCA%20results%201957.htm#SCC|title=SCCA Results 1957 |accessdate=1 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; one of five Bandini's in the first ten positions. The successes resulted in Ilario being presented with the Gold Key of Daytona and later in 1981 the Laurea H.C. award in mechanical engineering from PRODEO university of New York. In 1959 he produced one of the most successful [[Formula_Junior|Formula Juniors]].  Bandinis won SCCA Class HMod races well into the mid-1960s. A [[Bandini_1100_siluro|Bandini Siluro]] won the SCCA Southwest Regional Championship from 1961–1963 and the Saponetta took 3rd place in the National Hmod class in 1961.  Bandini continued to make one-off cars well into the 1980s. Ilario, sometimes known as the "great Drake of Forli" died in 1992.

==Memorial to Ilario Bandini==

[[File:Bandinibook.jpg|thumb|right|150px|'''Cover of the book, authors Franco Fabbri and Cesare Sangiorgi.''']]
On 16 November 2002 the city of Forlì, Italy remembered Ilario Bandini who is considered one of the most important Italian constructors of performance sports and race cars. The city dedicated a plaza (town square) to honor his name and the racing cars that bear his name.

==Bandini Museum and Register==
Since 1992, in Bandini's last workshop, Ilario's family has preserved all documents and collected the most representative cars for display. Ten Bandinis are in the museum and are shown by appointment.  46 Bandinis exist in the world today and are acknowledged by the Register.  They are owned from the U.S. to Japan.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1378">'''Basic sediment and water''' (BS&amp;W) is a technical specification of certain impurities in [[crude oil]].  When extracted from an [[oil reservoir]], the crude oil will contain some amount of water and [[suspended solids]] from the reservoir formation.  The particulate matter is known as sediment or mud.  The water content can vary greatly from field to field, and may be present in large quantities for older fields, or if oil extraction is enhanced using [[Water injection (oil production)|water injection]] technology.  The bulk of the water and sediment is usually separated at the field to minimize the quantity that needs to be transported further.  The residual content of these unwanted impurities is measured as BS&amp;W.  [[Oil refinery|Oil refineries]] may either buy crude to a certain BS&amp;W specification or may alternatively have initial crude oil dehydration and [[desalter|desalting]] process units that reduce the BS&amp;W to acceptable limits, or a combination thereof.

'''''Chief Culture Officer''''' (2009) is the eighth book by [[Canada|Canadian]] [[author]] and [[anthropologist]] [[Grant McCracken]].&lt;ref name=PsychologyToday&gt;{{cite web|title=Psychology Today Profile|url=http://www.psychologytoday.com/experts/grant-mccracken-phd|publisher=[[Psychology Today]]|date=February 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The book looks at how modern business attempt to connect with culture.  In the author's analysis he considers examples such as [[Dove Campaign for Real Beauty|Dove's campaign for real beauty]], and the [[I Love New York]] advertising campaign.

According to McCracken, the book is about highlighting the importance of modern culture for businesses, and in doing so, to create a position within them for a "person who knows culture, both its fads and fashions, and its deep, enduring structures": a Chief Culture Officer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=McCracken |first=Grant |year=2009 |title=Chief Culture Officer |location=P.2 |publisher=Basic Books |isbn=978-0-465-02204-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Synopsis ==

In the book, McCracken recounts how corporations that successfully adapt to the cultural changes tend to prosper.  His definition of [[culture]] begins with a distinction between fast and slow:

&lt;blockquote&gt;"Fast culture is like all the boats on the surface of the Pacific.  We can spot them, track them.  Slow culture is everything beneath the surface: less well charted, much less visible"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=McCracken |first=Grant |year=2009 |title=Chief Culture Officer |location=P.44 |publisher=Basic Books |isbn=978-0-465-02204-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 &lt;/blockquote&gt;

McCracken argues that when fast and slow culture meet, a convergent culture is created. He points to the [[preppy]] subculture as an example of a convergent culture that brands such as [[Ralph Lauren]] and [[Tommy Hilfiger]] have capitalized on. He also analyses the convergence of [[Social status|status]], shifting from a class based value system to celebrity, and the [[cool (aesthetic)|cool]] convergence, an aesthetic that he states developed alongside the [[baby boomer]] generation.

Changing relationships, McCracken argues, between consumers and producers have created new opportunities for brands to connect with culture. He observes that whilst only [[1% rule (Internet culture)|1 in 100]] people create content on the Internet, the creator consumer dynamic used to be "1 in 10,000".  McCracken believes this change allows consumers to become an "active participant in the branding process". He refers to [[converse (shoe company)|Converse's]] 2005 motto as an illustration of this change: 
&lt;blockquote&gt;"We don't own the brand.  Consumers do"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=McCracken |first=Grant |year=2009 |title=Chief Culture Officer |location=P.90 |publisher=Basic Books |isbn=978-0-465-02204-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
For business's attempting to closely monitor culture, McCracken advises against employing "cool hunters" who "know only what suits them."  Instead, he recommends creating a position for a Chief Culture Officer who is aware of both fast and slow culture, a "creature of many worlds, captives of none."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=McCracken |first=Grant |year=2009 |title=Chief Culture Officer |location=P.190 |publisher=Basic Books |isbn=978-0-465-02204-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Reception ==

[[Harvard Business Review]] recommended the book in their 2010 magazine, stating "a CCO is necessary for any competitive, consumer-oriented company".&lt;ref name=HBR&gt;Bell, Catherine.

'''''Conversational Capital: How to Create Stuff People Love to Talk About''''' is a book about engineering word-of-mouth into brand experiences. Contrary to the conventional theories of [[mass marketing]] literature, which teach that one must scream something ten times to be heard once, the authors teach that because we are all [[Storytelling| social storytellers]], a product experience that is worthy of telling as one's own authentic story creates enormous brand capital in the form of meaningful and influential conversations.

Developed by a trio of international brand architects, they share the insights behind their creative and strategic leadership for word-of-mouth success stories including [[Adidas]], [[Cirque du Soleil]], [[Red Bull]] &amp; [[MGM Grand Las Vegas|MGM Grand]].

==Overview==

Based on their experiences with some of the world's recognized generators of word-of-mouth, the authors behind Conversational Capital began to realize that experiences had residual value—value that extended further than mere memories but instead resided in the realm of identity-shaping and storytelling.  That is to say, when an experience was sufficiently powerful or transformative for an individual, they felt compelled to make the experience part of their own life story, and thereby propagate the story of the experience as part of their own (and now more exciting) identity.  With this in mind, Bertrand Cesvet, Tony Babinski and Eric Alper began to deconstruct the antecedents to word-of-mouth. Invariably, they found that the elements that gave rise to the conversations of consumers consisted of eight possible drivers. Critically, these elements fed into doing two things for the experience in question: 1) making it meaningful and 2) making it intense.

The authors of Conversational Capital share these eight key ingredients to embedding the makings of word-of-mouth into every consumer encounter with brands. They term these elements the Eight Engines of Conversational Capital.

===The Eight Engines===

'''1. Myths''' are the narratives that become part of the very fabric of consumption because they provide important clues as to fundamental meaning of that act.

'''2. Rituals''' are an essential part of how human beings create and formalize meaning. The presence of ritual marks out an experience as deeper in meaning - a phenomenon that is true for consumer experiences, as well.

'''3. Exclusive Product Offering (E.P.O.)''' is about allowing consumers to create an experience that asserts and actualizes their individuality; to, in a world of seven billion people, feel and be unique.

'''4. Relevant Sensorial Oddity (R.S.O.)''' is about challenging our senses with something extraordinary, marking an experience as unique.

'''5. Icons''' are signs and symbols that clearly demarcate a consumption experience from any other.

'''6. Tribalism''' is about the power of a brand experience to inspire the association of like-minded people.

'''7. Endorsement''' is not about celebrity — it's about how the meaning and intensity of a brand experience naturally lead to credible people organically endorsing it.

'''8. Continuity''' is a strong harbinger of reputation, a fact that rests on the unity between what you promise, what people expect and what you deliver.

The authors also recognize that Conversation Capital is nothing without conversational liquidity—the ability to share the stories as broadly as possible, and perhaps for this reason they frequently reference and recognize the [[Open Source]] movement and its way of creating connected communities that transcend geographic and other boundaries.

A '''Customer Advisory Council''' (also referred to as a '''Customer Advisory Board''' or '''CAB''') is a form of [[market research]] whereby a group of existing customers is convened on a regular basis to advise company management on industry trends, business priorities, and strategic direction. The CAB differs from traditional [[focus group]]s in the following ways:

* Membership is made up of senior executives from customer companies, not product users
* Topics of discussion tend to be more strategic than tactical  

== Composition ==
Customer advisory councils and CABs typically consist of 10 to 15 [[customers]] selected to represent a cross section of the customer base.  Proper selection of attendees requires identifying not only the most strategic customer company, but also the proper individual who can best represent their company's needs, priorities, and directions. Key individuals who have a strong relationship with the sponsoring company and have valuable ideas to contribute are ideal candidates.  Membership may also benefit from a few outspoken customers who have voiced strong complaints in the past about existing business practice.    

== Frequency and format == 
It is common practice for customer advisory councils to meet 1-2 times per year.  More frequent meetings are usually not practical due to time constraints of participants.  Furthermore, it takes a significant amount of time to process the advisory council recommendations and implement them within the existing company strategy.

Meetings are usually held face-to-face for half a day or more.  Meetings can also be held via [[teleconference]] or through interactive means though the level of 2-way dialogue may suffer.  Meeting agendas usually leave ample time for facilitated discussion using a variety of brainstorming and workshop techniques.

== Council member expectations ==
Council members usually participate on a voluntary basis for the opportunity to influence company direction in a way which is beneficial to their own needs as well as the customer community.  To maintain credibility it is important that the sponsors are committed to follow through on key recommendations made by the council or at minimum provide a rational explanation for those recommendations which are ultimately not implemented.  Participants also typically benefit from the prestige of participation, ability to network with each other as well as with company officers, and opportunity to share best practices and new ideas.

Dole owns a shipping line, Dole Ocean Cargo Express.

Dole's chairman founded the [[Dole Nutrition Institute]], a nutritional research and education foundation.

==History==
[[Image:DolePineapplePlantation.jpg|thumb|left|Dole Plantation on [[Oahu, Hawaii]].]]
The company traces its origin to the 1851 establishment of [[Castle &amp; Cooke]] by missionaries [[Samuel Northrup Castle]] and [[Amos Starr Cooke]]. Castle &amp; Cooke rapidly became one of the largest companies in Hawaii, investing in shipping, railroad construction, sugar production and seafood packing. The other half of Dole's corporate heritage, the '''Hawaiian Pineapple Company''', was founded in 1901 by [[James Dole]], who opened his first pineapple plantation in the central plateau of the Hawaiian island of [[Oahu]]. [[Sanford Dole]], the cousin of James, had been president of the [[Republic of Hawaii]] from 1894 after the [[overthrow of the Kingdom of Hawaii]] (her last monarch, [[Liliuokalani|Queen Lili{{okina}}uokalani]]), and first governor of the [[Territory of Hawaii]] until 1903.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://archives1.dags.hawaii.gov/gsdl/collect/governme/index/assoc/HASHb5a9/8f7a506f.dir/Dole,%20Sanford%20Ballard.jpg |title= Dole, Sanford Ballard office record |work= state archives digital collections |publisher= state of Hawaii |accessdate= 2010-01-20 |deadurl= yes |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20120306203149/http://archives1.dags.hawaii.gov/gsdl/collect/governme/index/assoc/HASHb5a9/8f7a506f.dir/Dole%2C%20Sanford%20Ballard.jpg |archivedate= 2012-03-06 |df=  }}&lt;/ref&gt;
The annexation of Hawaii to the United States made selling agricultural products to the mainland much more profitable, since they would never be subject to import [[tariff]]s.

In 1932, Castle &amp; Cooke purchased a 21% interest in the Hawaiian Pineapple Company. In the 1960s, Castle &amp; Cooke acquired the remainder of the Hawaiian Pineapple Company and the [[Standard Fruit Company]]. In 1976, it acquired Bud Antle Inc., a California-based lettuce and celery farmer; it was renamed Dole Fresh Vegetables in 1989. The company was renamed "The Dole Food Company, Inc" in 1991. Castle &amp; Cooke Inc, a [[real estate]] company, was spun off in 1995; it is currently operating as a subsidiary of Flexi-Van Leasing, Inc.

It was then the third largest producer and U.S. importer of bananas. Dole and [[Chiquita]] remain the top two U.S. banana companies as of 2011. In 2011, the company reported $7.2 billion in annual [[revenue]].&lt;ref name="hoovers"/&gt;

Dole operates plantations throughout [[Central America|Central]] and [[South America]], and in the [[Asia-Pacific]] region, with plantations in the [[Philippines]] and two packing plants in [[Thailand]], [[Hua Hin]] and [[Chumphon]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.dole.co.th/en/#contact-us |title=Locations of Dole Food Company in Thailand |last1= |first1= |last2= |first2= |year=2012 |work= |publisher=Dole Food Company |accessdate=9 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As part of a major restructuring in 2012, Dole agreed to sell its worldwide packaged foods and Asian fresh produce businesses to Japanese trading house [[Itochu]] for $1.7 billion in cash. The transaction paid down a large amount of Dole's debt and refocused the company's business on fresh fruit and vegetables.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Japan's Itochu to buy Dole Food businesses for $1.7 billion|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2012/09/18/us-dolefood-itochu-idUSBRE88H01L20120918|publisher=Reuters|accessdate=18 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The businesses acquired by Itochu continue to use the Dole brand and are owned by Dole International Holdings, a Tokyo-based subsidiary of Itochu.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Dole Business|url=http://www.itochu.co.jp/en/business/food/project/10/|publisher=Itochu Corporation|accessdate=2 September 2015|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150908001600/http://www.itochu.co.jp/en/business/food/project/10/|archivedate=8 September 2015|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Management===
In April 2017, Johan Linden was named [[Chief Executive Officer]], in addition to his role as President,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Executive Profile: Johan Linden, Chief Executive Officer and President, Dole Food Company, Inc.|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/research/stocks/private/person.asp?personId=290561769&amp;privcapId=259280&amp;previousCapId=259280&amp;previousTitle=Dole%20Food%20Company%20Inc.|publisher=Bloomberg|accessdate=31 January 2018|date=January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Johan Malmqvist was [[Chief Financial Officer]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=2017 Ranking of America's Largest Private Companies: Dole Food|url=https://www.forbes.com/companies/dole-food/|publisher=Forbes|accessdate=31 January 2018|date=2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Products===
[[File:Dolejf2103.JPG|thumb|220px|right|Fresh ripe Dole pineapples ([[Philippines]])]]
Including the original [[pineapple]], Dole distributes fresh plant foods in the forms of  whole fruits, whole vegetables,  berries, and fresh-cut vegetables. 
Packaged products include fruit bowls, fruit bowls in gel, fruit in plastic jars, fruit parfaits, fruit crisps, dates, raisins, and canned fruits. 
Frozen products include berries, tropical fruits, and fruit bars.
Juices are sold chilled, frozen, or canned.
Salad products include greens, salad kits, and shreds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title= All About Dole Products |work= official web site |publisher= Dole Food, Inc |url= http://www.dole.com/EatRightLanding/EatRtProductIndex/tabid/892/Default.aspx |accessdate= September 15, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1998 Dole bought several growers in [[Colombia]] and became the largest distributor of fresh-cut flowers in the US. However, by 2008 the flower business was losing money, and it was bought in January 2009 by a group of private investors.

===Corporate headquarters===
In 1994, Dole announced that it would finalize its plans to build its world headquarters on a {{convert|30|acre|m2|adj=on}} site owned by the company, located north of the [[Ventura Freeway]] in [[Westlake Village, California|Westlake Village]], California. The decision had been delayed by groundwater contamination tests and reviewing of possible site plan revisions.

==Legacy==
[[Image:Pineapple maze 1.JPG|thumb|Dole Plantation Pineapple Maze]]

The [[Guinness Book of World Records]] (2001) lists the pineapple maze at the Dole Plantation in [[Oahu, Hawaii]] as the world's largest [[maze]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dole-plantation.com/Maze/maze.aspx |title=Dole Plantation - Hawaii's Complete Pineapple Experience - Maze |accessdate=2008-02-14 |publisher=Dole Plantation, Inc. |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080121014452/http://www.dole-plantation.com/Maze/maze.aspx |archivedate=2008-01-21 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Dole Nutrition Institute]] (DNI) was founded by David H. Murdock in 2003 to "Feed the World with Knowledge" through research and education regarding the health benefits of a plant-based diet.

==Mascot==
[[File:Dole Mascots (41848912380) (cropped).jpg|thumb|Bobby Banana and Pinellopy Pineapple in San Diego in 2018]]
'''Bobby Banana''' is a [[mascot]] of Dole Food Company and the leader of the SuperKids (children who regularly eat five to nine fruits and vegetables every day).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dole.com/WhatsASuperkid/tabid/824/Default.aspx |title=WhatsASuperkid |publisher=Dole |date= |accessdate=2012-10-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He is an [[anthropomorphism|anthropomorphic]] [[banana]] who appears in Dole comics and games for children, along with friends Courtney Cauliflower, Mia Mango, Pinellopy Pineapple, and Gavin Grape, all of whom are also anthropomorphic fruits and vegetables.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dole.com/DoleFlashHomePage/tabid/972/Default.aspx#/superkids/ |title=Homepage |publisher=Dole |date=2010-06-21 |accessdate=2012-10-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1985 and 1986, the Dole banana was featured as the official banana of the Pittsburg State University (KS) Gorillas' athletic programs.  The project was the brainchild of then Pitt State radiosports play-by-play voice Scott Burton.  The introduction of the Dole banana as the official banana of the Gorillas delighted then Athletic Director David Suenram and Pittsburg State University sports fans alike.  The head football coach at the time of the promotion was Dennis Franchione.  Dole provided company trinkets for fan giveaways and the popularity of the Dole banana thrived in southeast Kansas and southwest Missouri (Joplin) during the promotion's two-year run.

==Advertising==

For a number of years, the [[country music]] artist [[Kenny Rogers]] advertised Dole's products on television. He would often be accompanied by his then wife, Marianne. Dole also sponsored several of Rogers' concert tours.

The [[banana industry]] has traditionally been dominated by a few large corporations, which employ [[low-wage work]]ers in [[developing countries]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Peter Chapman |title=Bananas: How the United Fruit Company Shaped the World |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=uQdHiU4lodAC&amp;pg=PA21 |date=July  2009 |publisher=Canongate U.S. |isbn=978-1-84767-194-3 |page=21}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title= The Banana Trade War |work= Global Issues Blog |author= Anup Shah |date= January 3, 2010 |url= http://www.globalissues.org/article/63/the-banana-trade-war |accessdate= September 15, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Dole was named as a defendant in a wrongful death lawsuit filed on behalf of 73 heirs of victims of paramilitary violence in Colombia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title= Juana Perez 1-51/Juan Perez 5E-50 v.

In 2007, [[Nicaragua]]n [[banana plantation|plantation]] workers, represented by [[Los Angeles]]-based [[personal injury]] [[lawyer]] [[Juan Dominguez (lawyer)|Juan Dominguez]], sued Dole and [[Dow Chemical Company]], claiming the use of illegal pesticides such as the now banned [[1,2-Dibromo-3-chloropropane|Nemagon]] (containing DBCP) had made them [[Infertility|sterile]]. The pesticide was not banned in Nicaragua until after Dole ceased its operations within the country. The suit and two others were subsequently thrown out by California courts after it was concluded that “[c]ontrary to their sworn testimony, most of the plaintiffs never worked on Dole-affiliated banana farms and none were involved in the DBCP application process,” while similar lawsuits were filed in U.S. and Nicaraguan courts.&lt;ref name="bloomberg.com"&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=20601109&amp;sid=aS5ED.ApmVPk | work=Bloomberg | title=Dole Uses Judge Attack in Banana Case to Undo $2 Billion Awards | date=June 24, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A lawyer for the Nicaraguans, Steve Condie, however, alleged that some of the witnesses had been paid by Dole to give testimony that the claims were fraudulent.  The witnesses' identities were kept secret so that the plaintiffs' lawyers could not interview them.&lt;ref name="bloomberg.com"/&gt;

Swedish film director [[Fredrik Gertten]] made a documentary film about Dominguez and the alleged banana workers. The movie ''[[Bananas!*]]'' premiered in the 2009 [[Los Angeles Film Festival]]. Dole said they had serious concerns about the film's accuracy and they urged festival officials to "immediately cease and desist" their sponsorship of the film.&lt;ref name="Edelman"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bananasthemovie.com/wp-content/uploads/resources/letter_from_dole_may8_09.pdf |title=Letter from Dole, May 8, 2009 |first=Scott A.|last=Edelman |work=bananasthemovie.com |date=May 8, 2009 |accessdate=October 6, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bananasthemovie.com/interview-with-director-fredrik-gertten/ |title=Interview with director Fredrik Gertten &amp;#124; BANANAS!* |publisher=Bananasthemovie.com |date= |accessdate=2012-10-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://svt.se/2.33782/1.1591791/bananas_far_inte_tavla_pa_festival |title=Bananas får inte tävla på festival - Regionala nyheter |publisher=svt.se |date= |accessdate=2012-10-05 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121006015213/http://www.svt.se/2.33782/1.1591791/bananas_far_inte_tavla_pa_festival |archivedate=2012-10-06 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="bananasthemovie_com-_article"&gt;{{cite web|title=About the film – BANANAS!*|url=http://www.bananasthemovie.com/about-the-film/#article}} 11 June 2009 - bananasthemovie.com&lt;/ref&gt; The festival officials allowed the film to be screened, but it was not allowed to compete for placement in the competition. In addition, festival officials distributed information before the film's screening that indicated Dole believed the film to be factually inaccurate.

Although the film was screened with a disclaimer from the festival, Gertten was subsequently sued for defamation by Dole.&lt;ref name="Deutcsh"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://seattletimes.com/html/businesstechnology/2009346592_apusdolebananaworkers.html |title=Dole sues 'Bananas!' filmmaker, alleges defamation |first=Linda |last=Deutcsh |agency=[[Associated Press]] |newspaper=[[The Seattle Times]] |date=July 9, 2009 |publisher=[[The Seattle Times Company]] |location=Seattle, WA, USA |accessdate=October 4, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The lawsuit was dropped on October 15, 2009, and in November 2010 a court in Los Angeles found in favour of the movie crew making it possible to release the movie in the USA, and ordering Dole to pay SEK 1.4 million (roughly USD 200,000) to the filmmakers.&lt;ref name="Mlik"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dn.se/kultur-noje/film-tv/-filmen-bananas-vann-mot-dole |title=Filmen "Bananas" vann mot Dole |trans-title=The film "Bananas" won against Dole |language=Swedish |first=Nora |last=Mlik |publisher=Dn.se |location=Stockholm, Sweden |accessdate=October 6, 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130116171719/http://www.dn.se/kultur-noje/film-tv/-filmen-bananas-vann-mot-dole |archivedate=January 16, 2013 |df= }} {{Google translation|en|sv|http://www.dn.se/kultur-noje/film-tv/-filmen-bananas-vann-mot-dole|Google  machine translation of this article}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Gertten's sequel ''[[Big Boys Gone Bananas!*]]'' documents Dole's reactions to ''Bananas!*''.

The Nicaraguan DBCP awards against Dole were overturned in July 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title= Judge throws out verdict awarding millions to Dole workers |newspaper= [[Los Angeles Times]] |author= Victoria Kim |date= July 16, 2010 |url= http://articles.latimes.com/2010/jul/16/local/la-me-dole-20100716  |accessdate= September 15, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 2013 [[Oxfam]] demanded Dole remove its "Ethical Choice" labels from its bananas in New Zealand until it improved treatment of its workers in [[the Philippines]], but Dole said Oxfam was trying to "destroy the Dole brand" in favour of other suppliers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url= http://www.3news.co.nz/Dole-bananas-not-ethical---Oxfam/tabid/1160/articleID/299404/Default.aspx |work=3 News NZ |title= Dole bananas not ethical - Oxfam| date=May 28, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Oct 2018 Myanmar Government blacklisted Thailand subsidiary of Dole after investigation found that one of its factory in Thailand exploited Myanmar migrant workers by demanding payments for visas, medical check-ups and work permit fees. Myanmar migrant workers are also prevented from taking paid annual leave. About 130 Myanmar migrants who took annual leaves were prevented from returning to work and got fired instead.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url= https://www.mmtimes.com/news/govt-blacklists-dole-thailand-over-labour-dispute.html |work=MyanmarTimes MM |title= Govt blacklists Dole-Thailand over labour dispute| date=Oct 10, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Labeling of genetically engineered foods in California===
In 2012, Dole Packaged Foods contributed $171,261 to a $46 million political campaign known as "The Coalition Against The Costly Food Labeling Proposition, sponsored by Farmers and Food Producers".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kcet.org/news/ballotbrief/elections2012/propositions/prop-37-funding-genetically-engineered-food.html |title=Who's Funding Prop 37, Labeling for Genetically Engineered Foods? &amp;#124; Propositions &amp;#124; Elections 2012 |publisher=KCET.org |date= |accessdate=2015-06-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Edwin Ellis (Ed) Tozer''' (born 1943) is a British retired management and IT consultant and [[SF author]],&lt;ref name="Amazon 2015"&gt;[https://www.amazon.com/Ed-Tozer/e/B003E0ZUGW Ed Tozer] at amazon.com. Accessed 9 May 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; particularly known for his early work on business information systems in the 1970s and 1980s.&lt;ref&gt;Andriole, Stephen J. "The collaborate/integrate business technology strategy." Communications of the ACM 49.5 (2006): 85-90.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Peña-Mora | first1 = Feniosky | last2 = Tanaka | first2 = Shunsuke | year = 2002 | title = Information technology planning framework for Japanese general contractors | url = | journal = Journal of Management in Engineering | volume = 18 | issue = 3| pages = 138–149 | doi=10.1061/(asce)0742-597x(2002)18:3(138)}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Life and work ==
Tozer started his career in the manufacturing and mining industry.&lt;ref name="T 86"&gt;Tozer (1986); {{cite journal | url = http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0024630186902670 | doi=10.1016/0024-6301(86)90267-0 | volume=19 | title=Developing strategies for management information systems | journal=Long Range Planning | pages=31–40}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1969 he became junior systems analyst at the management consultancy firm Scicon in London; a subsidiary of British Petroleum, originally known as Scientific Control Systems, chaired by Sir [[Maurice Kendall]]. After spells with other consulting firms, he worked with [[James Martin (author)|James Martin]]'s European operation from 1982 to 1984.

In 1984 he founded Edwin E. Tozer Limited, specialized in data management study, which he dissolved after his retirement in 2008.&lt;ref&gt;"[https://www.duedil.com/company/01791018/edwin-e-tozer-limited Edwin E. Tozer Limited]," at duedil.com. Accessed 23-03-2015.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1984 he published his first book, entitled "Application Development Tools." in 1988 his second book, "Planning for effective business Information systems," and in 1996 his third book, entitled "Strategic Is/It Planning."

Since his retirement in the new millennium he has been writing SF literature.&lt;ref name="Amazon 2015"/&gt;

== Work ==
In the 1970s Tozer became involved in the [[CODASYL]] development of database languages, and wrote his first articles on databases and systems analysis and design&lt;ref name="DBLP"&gt;{{DBLP |name=E. E. Tozer}}&lt;/ref&gt; He specialized in "effective application of Information Technology to business and administrative problems."&lt;ref name="T 86"/&gt;&lt;ref name="T 75"&gt;Tozer (1975)&lt;/ref&gt;

=== ''Database Systems Analysis and Design,'' 1976 ===
In the 1976 article "Database Systems Analysis and Design," Tozer made a comparison between the database field and the evolving field of the Programming technology. He argued:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Developments in the database field have tended to emphasise programming technology, with a dearth of accompanying progress in systems analysis and design methods. This paper puts forward an overall view of system design which is intended to act as a constraining framework. It is based upon a pragmatic approach and is presented in a form which could be (and is being) used on large scale implementation projects.&lt;ref name="T 76"&gt;Tozer (1976)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

And furthermore:
&lt;blockquote&gt;Orderly analysis and design procedures are encouraged. The taking of premature design decisions is discouraged, especially through the recognition of three distinct views of data: conceptual, implementation and storage, and through recognition of distinctions between design of each of these, specification of mappings between them, and design of programs and run sequences. It is envisaged that specific procedures developed elsewhere (see references) could be incorporated into the methodology described here.&lt;ref name="T 76"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

=== ''Developing strategies for management information systems,'' 1986 ===
{{see also|History of business architecture}}
In the 1989 article "Developing strategies for management information systems," Tozer presented a model for developing information systems. Tozer's approach was based on his experience of "planning projects in a variety of industries, including wholesale and retail banking, consumer credit, chemicals, Multinational manufacturing and distribution and the oil industry."&lt;ref&gt;Tozer (1986)&lt;/ref&gt; Tozer presented a model, which consisted of the following four phases:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
* ''Phase 1:'' Determine business information needs: This results from the analysis of a series of senior management interviews which are conducted according to a predefined format. The analysis goes through the stages of functional objectives, critical success factors, control information and other quantitative means for determining the successful achievement of critical success factors, leading to a definition of specific information needs.
* ''Phase 2:'' Development of conceptual architecture for systems and data: This phase produces clear architecture statements for application systems and associated conceptual database... 
* ''Phase 3:'' Determine key priorities and system groupings...
* ''Phase 4:'' Migration plane. The final sets of deliverables are the plans for achieving the business and technical systems as outlined in these architectures...&lt;ref name="FA 1990"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The key features of this model, according to Azad (1990) were:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
# [ït] starts with business planning process dealing with logical links and dependencies on corporate and divisional plans.
#Is pragmatic and hence practical.
#Combines formality and business expediency.
#Takes account of trends in business and information planning.
#Encourages the active use of up to date approach in the development if information systems utilising the fourth generation language by the user.
#Follows through into the development of a complete, practical, business orientated information system dealing with what must be done, how long it takes, and how much it is going to cost.
#Is open with regard to extension and enhancement.
#Has been used successfully in major corporations, continues to be used and hence is continuing to develop further.&lt;ref name="FA 1990"&gt;Farsheed Azad. "MSc. Information Engineering: An investigation on models and methodologies for developing an I.S. Stratey," June 1990. at pchelpline.com, uploaded 2012/07. Accessed 23-03-2015&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
In this 1986 paper Tozer was one of the first to propose the concept of [[business architecture]] in the field of business information systems planning.

=== ''Planning for effective business Information systems,'' 1988 ===
In his 1988 ''Planning for effective business Information systems,'' Tozer developed a particular view on [[Enterprise Data Planning]], that dealt with the complexities of extracting key business needs from senior management and then defining relevant architectural visions for the specific enterprise.

In the early 1980s [[James Martin (author)|James Martin]] had been one of the pathfinders in data planning methodologies. He was one of the first to identify data as being an enterprise wide asset that required management, and had developed a series of tools and methods to support that process.&lt;ref name=Martin&gt;[[James Martin (author)|James Martin]]. ''Viewdata and the information society.'' 1982&lt;/ref&gt;
 
Most of the large consulting firms developed their own methods to address the same basic issue. Frequently, their approaches were incorporated into their own branded system development methodologies that encompassed the complete systems development life-cycle.

=== ''Strategic IS/IT Planning,'' 1996 ===
Tozer's "Strategic IS/IT Planning", was published in 1996 by Butterworth Heinemann as part of the Datamation Professional Series. The book mentioned to offer: 
&lt;blockquote&gt;
* Supports a range of business planning techniques such as Portfolio Management and Value Chain Analysis. 
* Helps to ensure accurate and continuing aligning of IS/IT strategy with business goals and intentions. 
* Delivers a complete IS/IT plan, integrated with the business planning process, with effective provision for implementation and continuing maintenance. 
* Incorporates the latest advances in information technology, including Open Systems and Client/Server.&lt;ref name="T 1998"&gt;Tozer (1998)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
The book was the most comprehensive outline of Tozer's approaches, though it now appears very dated; for example because it didn't even mention the [[Internet]].&lt;ref name="T 1998"/&gt;

=== ''Morphosis,'' 2010 ===
In his 2010 [[science fiction]] novel "Morphosis," Tozer has been "speculating that mankind as an evolving species may still be in an early, vulnerable, fledgling state, as much at risk from itself as from environmental factors and competition from other species... [and] sometimes wonders whether it may be necessary - albeit difficult - for us as a species to shed some of the attributes and ingrained reflexes such as our tendency to violent conflict which we developed during our evolutionary struggle for survival so far before we can hope to reach our destiny as a mature species on the wider stage."&lt;ref name="Amazon 2015"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10006">'''European consumer law''' concerns [[consumer protection]] within Europe, particularly through [[European Union law]] and the [[European Convention on Human Rights]].

==General==
{{Clist eu consumers}}
{{see also|Consumer protection}}
Protection of European consumers has been a central part of developing the EU internal market. The [[Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union]] article 169 enables the EU to follow the [[ordinary legislative procedure]] to protect consumers "health, safety and economic interests" and promote rights to "information, education and to organise themselves in order to safeguard their interests".&lt;ref&gt;[[TFEU]] [https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Consolidated_version_of_the_Treaty_on_the_Functioning_of_the_European_Union/Title_XV:_Consumer_Protection art 169]&lt;/ref&gt; All member states may grant higher protection, and a "high level of consumer protection" is regarded as a fundamental right.&lt;ref&gt;[[TFEU]] art 169(3) and the [[CFREU]] [https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Charter_of_Fundamental_Rights_of_the_European_Union#Article_38_.E2.80.93_Consumer_protection art 38]&lt;/ref&gt; Beyond these general principles, and outside specific sectors, there are four main Directives: the [[Product Liability Directive 1985]], [[Unfair Terms in Consumer Contracts Directive 1993]], [[Unfair Commercial Practices Directive 2005]] and the [[Consumer Rights Directive 2011]], requiring information and cancellation rights for consumers. As a whole, the law is designed to ensure that consumers in the EU are entitled to the same minimum rights wherever they shop, and largely follows inspiration from theories of consumer protection developed in California and the [[Consumer Bill of Rights]] proclaimed by [[John F. Kennedy]] in 1962. The [[ECJ|Court of Justice]] has continually affirmed that the need for more consumer rights (than in commercial contracts) both because consumers tend to [[information asymmetry|lack information]], and they have [[Inequality of bargaining power|less bargaining power]].&lt;ref name="Case C-618/10"&gt;See ''[[Banco Español de Crédito SA v Camino]]'' (2012) [http://curia.europa.eu/juris/celex.jsf?celex=62010CJ0618&amp;lang1=en&amp;type=TXT&amp;ancre= Case C-618/10], [39] and ''[[Océano Grupo Editorial and Salvat Editores]]'' (2000) C-240/98 to C-244/98 and [2000] ECR I-4941, [25]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Ehrwald - SPAR interior.jpg|thumb|left|Due to their [[Inequality of bargaining power|unequal bargaining power]],&lt;ref name="Case C-618/10"/&gt; consumers are entitled to a legislative "charter of rights" to safe and healthy products, fair terms, proper information free from misleading advertising and marketing, and rights of cancellation.]]
The [[Product Liability Directive 1985]] was the first consumer protection measure. It creates [[Strict liability|strict]] [[enterprise liability]] for all producers and retailers for any harm to consumers from products, as a way to promote basic standards of health and safety.&lt;ref&gt;[[Product Liability Directive 1985]] [http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=CELEX:31985L0374:en:HTML 85/374/EEC], recital 1 and 6&lt;/ref&gt; Any producer, or supplier if the ultimate producer is [[insolvent]], of a product is strictly liable to compensate a consumer for any damage caused by a defective product.&lt;ref&gt;PLD 1985 arts 1 and 3&lt;/ref&gt; A "defect" is anything which falls below what a consumer is entitled to expect, and this essentially means that products should be safe for their purpose. A narrow defensive is available if a producer can show that a defect could not be known by any scientific method, thought this has never been successfully invoked, because it is generally thought a profit making enterprise should not be able to [[Externality|externalise]] the risks of its activities.

The [[Unfair Terms in Consumer Contracts Directive 1993]] was the second main measure.&lt;ref&gt;[[UTCCD 1993]] [http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=CELEX:31993L0013:EN:HTML 93/13/EC] and see [[H Collins]], 'Good Faith in European Contract Law' (1994) 14 OJLS 229&lt;/ref&gt; Under article 3(1) a term is unfair, and not binding, if it is not "individually negotiated| and "if, contrary to the requirement of [[good faith]], it causes a [[Just price|significant imbalance]] in the parties' rights and obligations arising under the contract, to the detriment of the consumer". The [[Court of Justice of the European Union|Court of Justice]] has continually affirmed that the Directive, as recital 16 states, "is based on the idea that the consumer is in a weak position vis-à-vis the seller or supplier, as regards both his [[bargaining power]] and his [[Information asymmetry|level of knowledge]]".&lt;ref&gt;''[[Banco Español de Crédito SA v Camino]]'' (2012) [http://curia.europa.eu/juris/celex.jsf?celex=62010CJ0618&amp;lang1=en&amp;type=TXT&amp;ancre= Case C-618/10]&lt;/ref&gt; Terms which are very skewed, are to be conclusively regarded as contrary to "[[good faith]]" and therefore unfair.&lt;ref&gt;See further, for the history behind the parallel in [[German contract law]], [[Bürgerliches Gesetzbuch|BGB]] §307 ''Münchener Kommentar zum Bürgerlichen Gesetzbuch'' §307 Rn 32&lt;/ref&gt; For example, in ''[[RWE AG v Verbraucherzentrale NRW eV]]'', clauses in gas supply contracts enabling the German utiliies company [[RWE]] to vary unilaterally prices were advised by the [[ECJ|Court of Justice]] to be insufficiently transparent, and therefore unfair.&lt;ref&gt;''[[RWE AG v Verbraucherzentrale NRW eV]]'' (2013) [http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/HTML/?uri=CELEX:62011CA0092&amp;rid=3 C-92/11]&lt;/ref&gt; In ''[[Brusse v Jahani BV]]''&lt;ref&gt;(2013) [http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/HTML/?uri=CELEX:62011CA0488&amp;qid=1413899840951&amp;from=EN C-488/11]&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Court of Justice of the European Union|Court of Justice]] advised that clauses in a tenancy contract requiring tenants pay €25 per day were likely unfair, and would have to be entirely void without replacement, if they were not substituted with more precise mandatory terms in national legislation. In ''[[Aziz v Caixa d'Estalvis de Catalunya]]'', following the [[global financial crisis]], the [[ECJ|Court of Justice]] advised that even terms regarding repossession of homes in Spain had to be assessed for fairness by national courts.&lt;ref&gt;(2013) [http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=CELEX:62011CJ0415:EN:HTML Case C-415/11]&lt;/ref&gt; In ''[[Kušionová v SMART Capital a.s.]]'', the [[Court of Justice of the European Union|Court of Justice]] held that consumer law was to be interpreted in the light of fundamental rights, including the [[right to housing]], in the event that a home could be repossessed.&lt;ref&gt;(2014) [http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/HTML/?uri=CELEX:62013CJ0034&amp;from=EN Case C-34/13]&lt;/ref&gt; Because consumer law operates through Directives, national courts have the final say on applying the general principles set out by the [[ECJ|Court of Justice]]'s case law.

The '''''Financial Times Deutschland''''' was a [[German-language]] financial newspaper based in [[Hamburg]], Germany, published by [[Bertelsmann]]'s [[Gruner + Jahr]] newspaper and magazine division. The daily contained four sections: Business, Politics &amp; Economy, Finance, and Agenda (Comment, Analysis, Sport, Culture). It ceased publication on 7 December 2012.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/media/2012/dec/07/germany-financial-times-deutschland-closes ''Germany's Financial Times Deutschland closes after huge losses'', Guardian, London, 7 December 2012].Retrieved: 20 December 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3587">{{Contract law}}
The doctrine of '''impracticability''' in the [[common law]] of [[contract]]s excuses performance of a duty, where that duty has become unfeasibly difficult or expensive for the party who was to perform.

Impracticability is similar in some respects to the doctrine of [[impossibility]] because it is triggered by the occurrence of a condition which prevents one party from fulfilling the contract.  The major difference between the two doctrines is that while impossibility excuses performance where the contractual duty cannot physically be performed, the doctrine of impracticability comes into play where performance is still physically possible, but would be extremely burdensome for the party whose performance is due.  Thus, impossibility is an [[Objectivity (philosophy)|objective]] condition, whereas impracticability is a [[Subjectivity|subjective]] condition for a court to determine.

Typically, the test U.S. courts use for impracticability is as follows (with a few variations among different jurisdictions):&lt;ref&gt;
See e.g. ''Transatlantic  Financing Corp. v. United States'',  [[Case citation|363 F.2d 312]]  ([[United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit|D.C. Cir.]],  1966)&lt;/ref&gt;

# There must be an occurrence of a condition, ''the nonoccurrence of which was a basic assumption of the contract'',
# The occurrence must make performance extremely expensive or difficult
# This difficulty was not anticipated by the parties to the contract (note: some jurisdictions require that there be no measure within the contract itself to [[Risk of loss|allocate risk]] between the parties)

==Restatement of Contracts==
Section 261 of the [[Restatement (Second) of Contracts]] does not explicitly define the scope of what is considered impracticable, as it is a fairly subjective and fact-intensive test for the courts.  Generally, courts do not consider events such as an increase in price or costs beyond a normal range to allow for discharge of duties on grounds of impracticability, as such events are normally foreseeable risks of fixed-price contracts.

==Uniform Commercial Code==
Section 2-615 of the [[Uniform Commercial Code]] deals with impracticability in the context of sales of goods, and introduces some additional constraints on the parties.  A party whose ability to perform his obligations has only been partially affected must allocate production and delivery among his customers in a manner which is fair and reasonable, affording each of them with partial performance, and must notify all purchasers that there will be delay, partial delivery, or non-delivery.  This is similar in some respects to the doctrine of [[general average]] in [[admiralty law]].

According to note 4 under UCC 2-615, increased cost alone does not excuse performance unless the rise in cost is due to some unforeseen contingency which alters the nature of performance.  It further explains that a change in market conditions resulting in a rise or drop in prices is not sufficient to claim impracticability because the parties assumed that risk when the contract was made.  The comments indicate that contingencies such as war, [[embargo]], crop failures, or a failure of a major source of supply that causes the market change or prevents a seller from obtaining supplies necessary for his performance would justify a claim of impracticability.

==Background and education==
Mwangi was born in [[Kangema]], in [[Central Province (Kenya)|Kenya's Central Province]], circa 1962. His father was killed in the [[Mau Mau]] conflict, so the young Mwangi, together with his six siblings were raised by '''Grace Wairimu Mwangi''', their single mother. He attended ''Nyagatugu Primary School'' in Kangema Village. He went on to ''Ichagaki Secondary School'', on a government scholarship, having excelled in primary school. For his A-Level education, he went to ''Kagumo High School'', where he studied [[economics]], [[English literature]] and [[geography]]. He went on to the [[University of Nairobi]], graduating with the degree of [[Bachelor of Commerce]] (BCom). He also sat and passed the [[Certified Public Accountant|Certified Public Accountant of Kenya]] (CPA) examinations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|

==Career==
In 1993, in his capacity as "Finance Director", he was tasked by the Chairman and by the CEO of '''Equity Building Society''' (EBS), to wind up the insolvent organisation which was losing KSh5 million (approx. US$60,000 then), annually and had, at that time, accumulated total losses of KSh33 million (approx. US$380,000 then). However the young Mwangi, aged about 31 at the time, began by motivating the 27 staff members to give better customer care to the 27,000 customers they had then. He also encouraged them to use 25% of their salaries to buy EBS shares. When things began to brighten up at EBS, the society began to sell shares to customers and to pay annual dividends in 1997. In 2000, the society computerized their operations. They were able to raise more capital and attract more customers. On 31 August 2004, Equity Building Society became [[Equity Bank Kenya Limited|Equity Bank Kenya]].

In 2006, Equity Bank listed on the [[Nairobi Stock Exchange]] (NSE). On Thursday 18 June 2009, the Group's stock cross listed on the [[Uganda Securities Exchange]] and started trading that day, under the symbol: '''EBL'''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newvision.co.ug/D/8/220/685424|title=Equity Bank Cross-Lists On USE|date=21 June 2009|accessdate=22 October 2014|first=Archive|last=Newvision|newspaper=[[New Vision]] (Kampala)|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20141021210134/http://www.newvision.co.ug/D/8/220/685424|archivedate=21 October 2014|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; {{asof|October 2014}}, the bank group has subsidiaries in [[Kenya]], [[Uganda]], [[Tanzania]], [[Rwanda]] and [[South Sudan]]. {{asof|March 2014}}, Equity Group Holdings Limited was a large financial services organisation in East Africa, with an asset base valued at over US$3.45 billion (KES:295 billion), with a total customer base in excess of 8.7 million, in the region the group serves.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Equity Group In 20 Percent Profit Rise to Sh3.8 Billion| url=http://allafrica.com/stories/201404171408.html|publisher=[[98.4 Capital FM|Capital FM Online]] (Nairobi) via [[AllAfrica.com]]| first=Kennedy|last=Kangethe|date=17 April 2014|accessdate=22 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Jean Pierre de Batz, Baron de Sainte-Croix''', known as the '''Baron de Batz'''&lt;ref&gt;[http://geneweb.inria.fr/roglo?lang=en;i=1760116 Jean Pierre de Batz&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; or '''de Bance''',&lt;ref&gt;"Histoire de la Convention Nationale, d'après elle-meme: précédée d'un tableau de la France monarchique avant la révolution", Volume 6 1835  by Léonard Gallois on page 294&lt;/ref&gt; (26 January 1754 &amp;ndash; 10 January 1822), was a [[France|French]] [[royalist]] and businessman. He was born in [[Goutz-les-Tartas]] ([[Gers]]), and died in Chadieu, near [[Vic-le-Comte]] ([[Puy-de-Dôme]]).

His life and actions in the service of [[Louis XVI]] inspired several popular novelists, including [[Baroness Orczy]] (''[[Eldorado]]'', 1913), [[Rafael Sabatini]] (''[[Scaramouche]]'', 1921) and more recently [[Juliette Benzoni]] (''Le Jeu de l'amour et de la mort'' series, 1999–2000).

==Biography==

===Royal agent===
Under the [[Constituent assembly#France|Constituent Assembly]], de Batz's reputation as a financier led to his 28 May 1790 appointment to the liquidation committee, which was responsible for clearing public accounts. It appears that de Batz conducted liquidations of fraudulent debts, sold to his friends who then reimbursed him. At the same time, he became a secret adviser to [[Louis XVI of France|Louis XVI]], and organized the financing of a secret policy implemented at the Chateau de Tuileries under [[Armand Marc, comte de Montmorin]] to defend the monarchy, which continued until at least 10 August 1792. On his own account, de Batz advanced to Louis XVI a sum exceeding 500,000 livres. His best ally was the Minister of Finance, [[Étienne Clavière]], and under the guise of missions Clavière entrusted to him, de Batz made several voyages abroad between March 1792 and January 1793.

On January 21, 1793, de Batz tried in vain to raise the crowd in boulevard de Bonne Nouvelle to save the king from execution. Several royalists were killed, though de Batz managed to escape. He remained partially in hiding until he obtained a certificate of non-emigration in June 1793.

===Accusations of conspiracies===
At the end of October 1793, fraud was uncovered in the liquidation of the [[French East India Company]], and de Batz was named as the leader of a vast conspiracy against the fledgeling republic. According to a declaration made in prison by [[François Chabot]], de Batz had frequently met with leaders of the [[Paris Commune]] and the [[National Convention]], including [[Committee of Public Safety]] members [[Claude Basire]], [[Julien de Toulouse]] and [[Joseph Delaunay|Delaunay d'Angers]]. Chabot also asserted that de Batz had held talks with foreign bankers including [[Moses Dobruška|Junius Frey]] and his brother Emmanuel Frey (of Austria), Pierre-Jean Berthold de Prosly (of Brussels), Andres Maria de Guzman (of Spain), and Jacob Pereira (of Portugal). However, this de Batz plot was itself a conspiracy, a political-police operation which concentrated the attention of the Jacobins on the alleged dangers of de Batz and his accomplices to the Convention, with the aim of dissolving it.

At the time, de Batz was constantly traveling between the provinces and Switzerland, and learned that his friends and most of his relations had been arrested. Denunciations were gathered to build an indictment and support the imaginary conspiracy. On 14 March 1794, [[Hébertistes]], [[Jean-Baptiste du Val-de-Grâce, baron de Cloots|Clootz]], Pereira and Prosly were [[guillotine]]d. On April 5, [[Georges Danton]] and his friends were executed with Chabot, Basire, the abbot of [[Espagnac]], Guzman, and the Frey brothers.

Police files and de Batz's passport would later exonerate him, as de Batz was not in Paris at the time of the liquidation.

===After the Reign of Terror===
Returning to France, de Batz was involved in the [[13 Vendémiaire|royalist insurrection]] of 5 October 1795, and imprisoned.  After the [[Coup of 18 Fructidor]] (4 September 1797), he took refuge in [[Auvergne (province)|Auvergne]] where he owned a castle. Discovered, he was arrested, but escaped during his transfer to [[Lyon]] and fled to Switzerland. The [[French Consulate]] had him removed from the list of emigrants and he abandoned political activism, returning to live in Auvergne.

Under the [[Bourbon Restoration]], he was awarded the rank of [[maréchal de camp]] (field marshal) and the [[Order of Saint Louis|cross of St. Louis]] for his services, as well as the military command of [[Cantal]], which was revoked after the [[Hundred Days]] period.

Living in seclusion in [[Authezat|Chadieu]], near [[Vic-le-Comte]], he died on 10 January 1822.

== Literary representations ==
The character of the double agent, a supporter of the monarchy and member of a network of Royalist agents in France and abroad whilst masquerading as a staunch Republican, is a stock character in literature set during the French Revolution.  Through his activities, this character sends many revolutionaries to the guillotine, having them convicted of being anti-revolutionaries. Fictionalizations of de Batz appear in several novels:
*Jean de Batz is the hero of a series of novels by Juliette Benzoni, ''The Game of Love and Death''.
*The Baron de Batz appears in a few of ''[[The Scarlet Pimpernel]]'' series of books by [[Baroness Orczy]], playing the most prominent role in ''[[Eldorado (novel)|Eldorado]]''.
*He also appears as a major character in [[Raphael Sabatini]]'s novel, ''Scaramouche the Kingmaker'', and a minor character in ''The Lost King''.
*Jean de Batz is a lead character in the historic fiction novel ''Seed of Mischief'' by Willa Gibbs, 1953. The book revolves around the Dauphin, Louis-Charles (1785–1795).
There are also biographies of de Batz:
*''Marie Antoinette's henchman – the carrier of Jean de Batz, in french revolution'' by Meade Minnigerode (1936)
*''A Gascon Royalist in revolutionary Paris'' by Rodolph Stawell, reprinted from "Forgotten books".

'''José Artés de Arcos''' (1893–1985) was a [[Spain|Spanish]] businessman. He was born in [[Alhama de Almeria, Almeria]] on February 27, 1893. He died on 1 January 1985 in [[Almería]]. He was known in the automotive world, among many other accomplishments, for being the driver of racing cars such as the Guepardo of [[Formula 4]] (1966), the Artés Campeador (1967) or the amphibious 6-wheel car the Artés Gato Montés (1971).

==Biography==
José Artés de Arcos was born into a family of bakers, and already at a very young age his manual dexterity was noted. He used to repair and make everyday objects. He worked in different mining companies, such as "Sota Aznar" and the "Spanish Mining Company of San Juan" in [[Melilla]]. In that city he developed his first patent: the [[rotary engine]] registered under no. 61714, the first of more than five hundred which he managed to produce throughout his life.

==Career==

===The workshop in Barcelona===
In 1918 José Artés de Arcos moved to [[Barcelona]], where he worked in a company that was dedicated to the repair of ship engines. Following a major repair, his remuneration helped him establish himself, in 1927, in a small auto repair shop. In 1929, he was living in a small wooden loft installed on the premises of his industry, located in Corsica Street. The name Artés can still be seen on the bumper of His Majesty King [[Alfonso XIII of Spain|Alfonso XIII]]'s car.

===The fuel economizer and the intake speakers===
Among other inventions are the gas economizer which became the most famous and productive of his patents, and the intake horn, which was soon copied by the majority of countries. He held a demonstration of this invention by attaching it to a car and touring Spain on a promotional tour, to the astonishment of the inhabitants of towns and cities on seeing a set of ten note loudspeakers playing regional music.

That journey ended in the courtyard of the [[Palacio de Oriente]], which he entered playing the [[Royal March]], and shortly afterwards on the [[Champs Elysees]] in Paris at the Motor Show, playing the [[Marseillaise]]. Over the years, his business has occupied an important place in the world of ancillary automotive industries, being awarded the Silver Medal of Merit for his work in 1965.

==Business career==
In 1972 in a memoir Artés de Arcos wrote:
&lt;blockquote&gt;'' "Like so many others I also had to leave home and my people (Alhama de Almería), and like so many, I headed for the highly industrial region, industrious and intelligent, Catalonia, where work together with studies in the hours that belonged to rest, the sum struggle for life, for long, long years, has been crowned with success, not through easy business nor via lotteries, let alone through human exploitation, but by creating innovations that the public consumer paid for handsomely, like a caprice, my own inventions that have gone around the world and have been copied in all the industrialized countries." ''&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In Barcelona, for his performance as a member of the Chamber of Commerce, Industry and Navigation, plus the work done for its producers, building them two groups of 60 homes among other social benefits, and at their request, the Government granted Artés de Arcos the title of Business Model.

==Recognition==
Joseph Artés de Arcos was named Honorary Citizen of the town of [[Arenys de Munt]], plus given the Gold Medal of the City for his achievements there. He was also granted a street, and a plaque commemorating the electrification of the District of Sobirans, Catalonia, which he paid in full, benefiting the whole neighborhood. Years later, for unexplained reasons, this was the only village where these recognitions were withdrawn.

He was also named [[Favourite Son]] of the town of [[Alhama de Almeria]], which granted him a street and erected a monument in his memory for the accomplishments that he contributed to his hometown, such as the recovery of the San Nicolas spa, the waters, both for private use at the spa, as well as public use.

In Barcelona, for his work as a member of the Chamber of Commerce Industry and Shipping, plus the work done for their producers, building them two groups of 60 homes and other social benefits, and at their request, the Government granted the title of Enterprise model.

==Manufacturing career==
As an entrepreneur, José Artés de Arcos founded his own company, called José Artés de Arcos SA, a pioneer in Spain in the field of automotive industry supplies, as a manufacturer of lights, speakers, board boxes, flyers, among others. He introduced the French multinational, Jaeger, into Spain, forming the Artés-Jaeger company, whose production halls were found in [[Barberà del Vallès]], Barcelona Province. In this company all automotive electronic parts from different European brands were made. Artés de Arcos also brought the French headlights manufacturing company, Cibie, to Spain with which he formed a company called PASA. This time he took advantage of the industrialization plans of southern Spain, building the factory in [[Martos, Jaén|Martos, Jaén province]]. José Arcos Artés S.A. had production facilities in Barcelona, Madrid and Almeria, from which it supplied to automotive manufacturers.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4101">'''Ernst Karl''' (sometimes also '''Carl''') '''Erdmann Heine''' (January 10, 1819 – August 25, 1888) was a [[lawyer]] in Leipzig and a major [[entrepreneur]] and industrial pioneer who shaped the face of the western suburbs of Leipzig.

== Life ==
[[Image:Karl-Heine Denkmal in Leipzig.jpg|thumb|Karl Heine's monument in Leipzig]]

Karl Heine was born in [[Leipzig]], to the owner of Neuscherbitz Estate, Johann Carl Friedrich Heine, and his wife Christiana Dorothea, née Reichel (1781–1857). He attended the ''[[Thomasschule zu Leipzig]]'', a public boarding school in Leipzig. Later he studied law at the [[University of Leipzig]] - he was member of the [[Corps Saxonia Leipzig]] fraternity. He received a [[doctorate]] on the economic use of waterways and shores according to Saxon state law. Later, he established himself as a barrister in Leipzig .

After the death of his grandfather E.T. Reichel (1748–1832), Karl Heine bought the shares of Reichel's Garden from another heir, took these pieces of land and from the medial of the 19th century on, he gradually built what is today the inner western suburb of Leipzig.

In 1854, Heine also expanded his estate in the ''Gemeinde Plagwitz'' district of Leipzig; in 1856, he began the construction of the first section of a navigable canal connecting the rivers [[Weisse Elster]] and [[Saale]], which today bears his name (''Karl-Heine-Kanal''). The excavation of the canal reclaimed which was later to become the western suburb of Leipzig. To institute his plans for construction and industrialization, Heine established an "economy" in Plagwitz.

When the western suburb was connected to ''Gemeinde Plagwitz'', Heine constructed the ''Plagwitzer Straße'' (today named ''Käthe-Kollwitz-Straße''), a street to the south of the old highway from Leipzig to [[Lindenau (Leipzig)|Lindenau]], which ran parallel to the new street. Against the opposition of the Leipzig council, he also built the Plagwitz bridge, which connected to the ''Leipziger Straße'' in Plagwitz (today: ''Karl-Heine-Straße'').

Karl Heine was a member of the Saxon Diet from 1870 to his death. He was also a representative in the Leipzig city council.

In 1874, he moved into his newly built villa in Neuschleußig ([[Karl-Heine-Villa]], ''Könneritzstraße 1''), where he resided until his death.

In 1876, a construction scheme was approved which encompassed merging Karl Heine's meadows and fields in the northern part of [[Schleußig]] (''Neuschleußig'') with Bernhard Hüffer's (1824–1904) estate and extensive undeveloped forest land. These areas would be designated as new residential areas. 

On May 24, 1888, Heine founded the ''Westend-Baugesellschaft'', a construction company, to continue his work in developing the Leipzig economy after his death.

Since 1854, Karl Heine had also been a member of the Leipzig [[masonic lodge]] ''Apollo''. He died on August 25, 1888, aged 69, in Leipzig.

==Honours==
In 1897, the city of Leipzig honoured Karl Heine with a monument. The monument was melted down in the Second World War but was renewed in 2001. Many streets and one plaza are named after him. (''Erdmannstraße'', 1891; ''Karl-Heine-Straße'', 1904; ''Karl-Heine-Platz'', et al.)

In 2003, a Leipzig vocational school adopted the name of ''Karl-Heine-Schule''.

{{Foreign Exchange}}
'''Managed float regime''' is the current [[international finance|international financial]] environment in which [[exchange rate]]s fluctuate from day to day, but [[central bank]]s attempt to influence their [[country|countries']] exchange rates by buying and selling [[currency|currencies]] to maintain a certain range. The peg used is known as a [[crawling peg]].

In an increasingly integrated world economy, the currency rates impact any given country's economy through the [[trade balance]]. In this aspect, almost all currencies are ''managed'' since [[central bank]]s or [[governments]] intervene to influence the value of their currencies. According to the [[International Monetary Fund]], as of 2014, 82 countries and regions used a managed float, or 43% of all countries, constituting a plurality amongst exchange rate regime types.&lt;ref name=Nikkei&gt;{{cite news|title=IMF finds more countries adopting managed floating exchange rate system|url=http://asia.nikkei.com/Markets/Currencies/IMF-finds-more-countries-adopting-managed-floating-exchange-rate-system|accessdate=5 March 2015|work=Nikkei Asian Review|agency=Nikkei|date=August 19, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Parallel Education''' is a system in which boys and girls in Australia attend the same school, but are split into [[Gender segregation|single sex]] classes for core subjects such as [[English language|English]], [[Maths]], [[science]], [[LOTE]], and [[humanities]]. However, [[student]]s will come together for [[drama]], [[music]] and other social and cultural activities although a strict 30&amp;nbsp;cm personal space rule applies. Theoretically, this means that students will receive the best education while still being able to interact with the opposite sex. {{Citation needed|date=February 2009}}

[[Haileybury College, Melbourne]] currently operates Parallel Education at their five campuses with many other leading schools set to follow.

'''Paul Bulcke''' (born 8 September 1954) is a Belgian businessman who is the chairman and former CEO of [[Nestlé]].

==Early life==
He graduated as a commercial engineer at the [[Katholieke Universiteit Leuven]] and is an [[alumnus]] of the [[Vlerick Leuven Gent Management School]]. He also attended the program for executive development at the Swiss leading business school [[International Institute for Management Development]] (IMD) in [[Lausanne]].

==Career==
[[File:Paul Bulcke - Davos 2010.jpg|thumb|Bulcke during the [[World Economic Forum|WEF]] 2010]]
In 1979, aged 25, he started working for the Nestlé group and worked in different countries, including Switzerland, Spain, Belgium, Peru, Ecuador, Chile, Portugal, Czech Republic and Germany. Before his appointment as CEO of Nestlé, he was the executive vice president of its Americas divisions.

Bulcke has described Nestlé under his tenure as 'une force tranquille' (English: 'calm strength'). He is known for having a reserved, quiet personal manner.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/newsbysector/retailandconsumer/7286179/Nestle-chief-executive-Paul-Bulcke-is-not-one-for-a-break-but-he-loves-his-Kit-Kat.html |title=Nestlé chief executive Paul Bulcke is not one for a break, but he loves his Kit Kat |work=Telegraph |date=21 February 2010 |accessdate=3 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He was succeeded as CEO by [[Ulf Mark Schneider]] in January 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.nestle.com/media/pressreleases/allpressreleases/management-changes|title=Nestle Press Release, Jun 27, 2016|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Controversy==

On August 30, 2012, Bulcke claimed that water is not a human right and should be privatized. He was quoted as saying: "If something isn't given a value, people tend to waste it. Water is our most useful resource, but those using it often don’t even cover the costs of its infrastructure. Fresh water is being massively overused at nature's expense, but it seems only a global crisis will make us realise the importance of the issue.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3569">The '''plastics industry''' manufactures [[polymer]] materials — commonly called [[plastics]] — and offers services in plastics important to a range of industries, including [[packaging]], building and [[construction]], [[electronics]], [[aerospace]], and [[transportation]].

It is part of the [[chemical industry]]. In addition, as [[mineral oil]] is the major constituent of plastics, it is regarded a part of the  [[petrochemical industry]].

Besides plastics production, [[plastics engineering]] is an important part of the industrial sector. The latter field is dominated by [[engineering plastic]] as [[raw material]] because of its better mechanical and thermal properties than the more widely used [[commodity plastics]].

A '''shareholder committee''' is a committee formed to assess the current board of directors and assess potential future directors. A shareholder committee typically holds two or three short meetings a year. A shareholder committee is created when a vote to do so passes at a general [[Shareholder|shareholders]] meeting in response to a resolution to hold such a vote. The vote is advisory however ‘it would be a pretty balsy board to reject it’ sub Chairman answer from the 2010 ICGN Conference in London. The committee is typically formed of three voluntary large shareholders, a recognised private investor shareholder organisation representative and the non executive chairman of the board as [[Chairman|convenor]] who is responsible for Board Director selection. The committee is empowered to search for future directors and to retain executive recruiters to carry out the search at the company’s expense.

==History==

In 1993 the Shareholders Nomination to the AGM Committee (SNAC) were started by the Swedish Private Shareholders Organization, Aktiespararna, in response to the 1992 [[Cadbury Report]] into [[Corporate Governance|corporate governance]]. Private shareholders thought it would be good idea to invite the Chairman to meet with them and other large shareholders to discuss the existing and future management and selection of the board of directors.
Initially many of the largest shareholders refused, allowing many keen overweight smaller institutional investors to join. Adverse Swedish press coverage of big [[pension]] funds refusing to attend these short one-hour meetings with the Non Executive Chairman of the Board resulted in big investment funds organising themselves to attend. Shareholder Committees are held throughout Sweden and in Nordic country’s whilst the UK has in 2017-18 a successful voluntary one at Marks And Spencer PLC. 

The [[UK Shareholders Association]], UKSA, picked up the idea in the early days of their formation in 1993 before the idea was then overwhelmed by the push back on 1p share options. Renamed "Shareholder Committee” the idea faces strong opposition from the existing CEOs and chairman however the promotion by merit was liked by talented directors.

Cevian Capital senior partner Harlan Zimmerman and  [[Mark Goyder]] of Tomorrow's Company collaborated to produce a report that reintroduced the idea to the UK at an 2010 ICGN Corporate Governance Conference.

As an [[Annual general meeting|AGM]] resolution it requires no changes in the company’s [[articles of association]] and a standard resolution format was adopted in Sweden that sets out the voluntary selection processes and operations. Sensible rules like only allowing a shareholder to chair the meeting, requiring the Chairman of the Board to invite the shareholders to join, setting out when a member can formally leave the committee (if they no longer have any shares held in that company), only accepting beneficial owner shareholders that volunteers to join and proposing an annual re election at the AGM of members so there is a full shareholders mandate and approval of the individual elected members. 

Typically the largest institutional owners or their fund manager representatives operate a one year on one year off policy to allow the manager freedom to trade their index tracking portfolio of shares. Pension Fund Trustees reported a significant 0.5% improvement in Fund managers who attended performance. Citation needed.

2011 A founding director Gavin Palmer of [[ShareSoc]] reinvigorated the old idea and the Board of [[ShareSoc]] produced a policy paper supporting the proposal.

DTI Minister [[Vince Cable]] participated in a consultation and caused the formation of something similar [[The Investors Forum]] &lt;ref&gt;https://www.investorforum.org.uk&lt;/ref&gt; which had great success with [[Balfour Beatty]] PLC and several other engagements. However that proposal lacked a seat for the private investor organization in Sweden. The Investors Forum created a report found that there was a demand from Chairman in normally performing PLC that have been overlooked by large investors. A regular consultation with the Chairman helps in deciding the direction of the company for instance re Brexit. 

In 2012 a shareholder proposal was made to have the Board of '''[[Royal Bank of Scotland|RBS]]''' to propose the establishment of a Shareholder Committee which was refused by both the Board and the Board's Nomination committee.

2013 Corporate Governance Conference was held in Parliament and Gavin Palmer won the competition for the Best Conference Paper with a proposal for establishing Shareholder Committees and to include the attendance of the largest creditor to the PLC which was deemed ‘an elegant solution’ for RBS Group PLC by a prominent MP.

In 2016 Chris Philp MP included Shareholder Committees in a proposal to the UK Parliament &lt;ref&gt;www.chrisphilp.com/blog.asp?BlogID=72&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2017-18 growing calls from [[ShareSoc]] and [[Manifest Total Remuneration Survey|Manifest]] director Cliff Weight with founding member Gavin Palmer were made to the [[Royal Bank of Scotland]] (RBS). Shareholder requisitions for a resolution were made before year ends in 2016 and 2017. Despite the 163 signatories in 2016, RBS refused to put the resolution forward to the 2017 Annual General Meeting citing unspecified legal reasons.{{cn|date=May 2018}}

In 2018 The RBS Board accepted the resolutions and text for the 30th May 2018 AGM with an AGM debate - a UK first.
Special Resolution 27. To direct the Board to establish a Shareholder Committee. 
RBS has 190,000 shareholders with UK Government Investments (UKGI) formerly called [[UK Financial Investments]] (UKFI) owning 73%. Since reduced by selling after the Agm. The Shareholders resolution was comprehensively defeated with the UKGIs vote although a review of the Agm video shows that the attending shareholders had no idea of what resolution was being put to the vote during the meeting.

==Operation==

[[Shareholders]] submit the  resolution dealing primarily with [[corporate governance]] as a way to fairly and formally organise fellow beneficial shareholders to discuss the selection of Directors. The Chairman of the Board acts as a voter, guide and member. New volunteer Shareholder representatives are elected annually by all shareholders after being invited by the Chairman of the Board to join according to their beneficial shareholding. Acceptance is voluntary and popular as membership has been shown to improve a Pension Fund managers performance by 0.5% per year, a considerable improvement despite voluntarily stopping trading the shares for a year whilst elected in case of hearing an impending top three board member change that was consider price sensitive. An independent analyst attributed this to the Fund Manager understanding the talent and plans of the management better just like [[Warren Buffett]]. 

Virtually all shareholder resolutions are non-binding (or "precatory," to use the legal term of art).&lt;ref&gt;Monks, Robert A. and Nell Minow. ''Corporate Governance''. Blackwell Publishers, 2001.&lt;/ref&gt; In this sense the voting on these resolutions more closely resembles a poll than it does a (binding) [[referendum]] or [[plebiscite]]. Still, media coverage of voting on shareholder resolutions tends to focus on whether the proposal received a majority of votes. 

Shareholder resolutions have been an important part of activist campaigns in several cases. For example, resolutions were effective at raising public awareness and thereby pressuring corporate management about investments in [[Shell Transport and Trading|Shell Transport and Trading PLC]] about Green issues by the organisation Follow This, [[apartheid]] [[South Africa]], [[nuclear power]], and [[labor disputes]]. Given these results, resolutions have been spearheaded by several coordinating groups, including the [[AFL-CIO]] and the [[Interfaith Center on Corporate Responsibility]]. Governmental, Local Authoritys, Trade unions [[pension funds]] also have become involved in supporting and submitting shareholder resolutions.

[[Image:Shell Headquarters 1 db.jpg|thumb|300px|[[Shell Mex House]], home of Shell-Mex and BP Ltd]]
'''Shell-Mex and BP Ltd''' was a British [[Joint venture|joint marketing venture]] between petroleum companies [[Royal Dutch Shell]] (Shell) and [[British Petroleum]] (BP).  It was formed in 1932 when both companies decided to merge their United Kingdom marketing operations,&lt;ref&gt;Reference and contact details: GB 1566 SMBP Title:Shell-Mex and BP Archive Dates of Creation: 1900-1975 Held at: BP Archive GB 1566 SMBP&lt;/ref&gt; partly in response to the difficult economic conditions of the times.

The parent organisations de-merged their United Kingdom marketing operations in 1976. The announcement was as follows:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
Since 1932 the products of the Companies of the Royal Dutch/Shell Group and of The British Petroleum Group have been marketed in the UK through the agency of Shell-Mex and B.P. Ltd. In that year the company's business amounted to about 3 million tons, out of a total UK market of some 7 million tons.

The activities of this most successful enterprise have extended greatly over the years. In 1970 Shell-Mex and B.P. Ltd. supplied 40 million tons of the UK petroleum market, amounting to a total of 100 million tons.

In the majority of countries outside the UK. Shell and BP have always each marketed their products through their own entirely separate organisations and it has been decided that Shell and BP marketing operations in the UK should now be brought more into line with this pattern over the next 4-5 years.

Since 1966 the Shell and the BP Service Station networks have been managed by separate sales organisations within Shell-Mex and B.P. It is now proposed to extend this 'brand streaming' progressively to cover all products and all market sectors. This will ultimately lead to the establishment of two viable marketing organisations within Shell-Mex and B.P. thus facilitating the termination of the agency agreement.

The National Benzole Company will continue to trade under the National brand and will form part of the BP marketing organisation.

The Supply, Storage and Delivery functions, and the Computer and other services, will be the object of further detailed study once brand streaming of direct trade is substantially complete and a plan for the treatment of Authorised Distributors is agreed. Should it be decided that these functions should continue for a period after the transfer of the sales activities, then these will continue to be carried out by Shell-Mex and B.P.

The employees of Shell-Mex and B.P. will be redeployed within the separate marketing organisations and redundancies will not arise as a result of this re-organisation.{{citation needed|date=April 2011}}
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The company's head offices were at [[Shell Mex House]] on London's [[Strand, London|Strand]].

==Biography==
He was born in [[Arklow]] where his family lived in Templerainey&lt;ref name="wicklow-1224"&gt;
{{cite news |url=http://www.wicklowpeople.ie/news/arklow-highflyer-in-aer-lingus-bid-1585736.html |title=Arklow highflyer in Aer Lingus bid |last=Coleman |first=Deborah |date=24 December 2008 |work=[[Wicklow People]] |accessdate=15 May 2009}}

&lt;/ref&gt; By 1998 they moved to [[Carlow]] where he claimed to own 'The Foundry' [[nightclub]].&lt;ref name="wicklow"/&gt; (In fact, The Foundry is part of the Dinn Rí Hotel complex&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite web |url=http://www.dinnri.com/intro.htm |title=Dinn Rí Entertainment Complex – profile |accessdate=15 May 2009}}

&lt;/ref&gt;) Pearson qualified as an accountant in [[Portlaoise]] c.2008.&lt;ref name="wicklow-1224"/&gt; He moved with his wife and two daughters to [[County Kilkenny]],&lt;ref name="kk2908"/&gt; where he rented a house in [[Goresbridge]]&lt;ref name="it0515"/&gt; and worked in a convenience store in [[Graiguenamanagh]].&lt;ref name="kk2908"/&gt;&lt;ref name="it0515"&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; He was attacked in a robbery on the shop in January 2008.&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; In May 2009,  ''[[The Irish Times]]'' reported that he had [[legal separation|separated]] from his wife, who claimed to have no knowledge of his business dealings; and that locals in Goresbridge were surprised by and sceptical of the reports of Pearson's extreme claim of wealth.&lt;ref name="it0515"/&gt; The ''[[Irish Daily Mail]]'' had expressed similar scepticism in December 2008.&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;

==Purported investments==
According to interviews, Pearson inherited money from relatives' land in 2003.&lt;ref name="wicklow"/&gt;&lt;ref name="kk2908"&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; This was held by [[trustee]]s till 2008,&lt;ref name="kk2908"/&gt; who invested it in property, mostly commercial property, in Ireland and Britain.&lt;ref name="it-1030"/&gt;&lt;ref name="kk2908"/&gt;&lt;ref name="it-1107"&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; from an investment in New York City.

In October 2008, Pearson was reported to have been negotiating to buy Taggart Holdings, a housebuilding firm based in [[Northern Ireland]]&lt;ref name="ind-1311"/&gt; which was in [[administration (law)|administration]] with debts reported at €150m.&lt;ref name="it-1030"/&gt;&lt;ref name="kk2908"/&gt;&lt;ref name="it-1107"/&gt; In December 2008, it was reported that he might invest in [[Aer Lingus]],&lt;ref name="it-1218"/&gt; and subsequently that he might launch a [[takeover]] offer of up to €900m, funded from a [[war chest]] of €1.5–2b.&lt;ref name="ind-2012"&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; In 2009, he was reported to be planning to build a [[retirement village]] in Arklow, and to start an [[insurance company]].&lt;ref name="wicklow-1224"/&gt; He is reported to support many charities in Carlow and Kilkenny, and in April 2009 was producing a DVD showcasing investment opportunities in the region.&lt;ref&gt;

'''''The Prague Post''''' was an [[English language]] [[newspaper]] covering the [[Czech Republic]] and [[Central Europe|Central]] and [[Eastern Europe]] which published its first weekly issue on October 1, 1991. It published a printed edition weekly until July, 2013 when it dropped the printed product to focus on its online platforms, including the website PraguePost.com, a Kindle edition and online subscriptions.[http://www.radio.cz/en/section/curraffrs/end-of-an-era-as-prague-post-goes-online-only]. In 2016 Prague Post filed for bankruptcy.&lt;ref name="mediar.cz"&gt;http://www.mediar.cz/vydavatel-prague-postu-chce-vyhlasit-upadek/&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mission and goals==
''The Prague Post'' was an English-language information source in the [[Czech Republic]] through its newspaper, and related products and services.

==History==
In July 1991, Lisa Frankenberg and Kent Hawryluk, two employees of ''Prognosis'', an English-language monthly newspaper in [[Prague]] which began publication in March 1991,&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.mattwelch.com/prognosis.html Matt Welch | Prognosis]". http://www.mattwelch.com.

Together with Monroe Luther, an investor from [[Houston]], [[Texas]], they formed Lion’s Share Group, a privately held, Czech limited-liability company (spol s r.o.) that was created to be the information leader in the region. Kent Hawryluk served as Founding Publisher and Lisa Frankenberg as Founding General Manager. Other programs introduced at that time were the Business Network, Lion’s Share Group Publishing and the Prague Post Foundation (set up separately as a Czech-registered, non-profit foundation, and which later became The Prague Post Endowment Fund with the change in Czech nonprofit laws).

The mission of ''The Prague Post'' was simple and direct: to publish the best possible English-language newspaper for and about the rapidly changing Czechoslovakia and more broadly, Central Europe. The aim was to place particular emphasis on news, business, and cultural listings.

[[Alan Levy]], a foreign correspondent for the [[International Herald Tribune]] and author of ''So Many Heroes'', an eyewitness account of the 1968 Warsaw Pact invasion of Czechoslovakia, was hired as the Founding Editor-in-Chief.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.thinkexpats.com/component/content/article/309.html Alan Levy, The Pen of Prague]". http://www.thinkexpats.com. Retrieved on 20 March 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; The original staff hired by Levy included former reporters and editors from a wide range of magazines and daily newspapers, including the ''Sacramento Bee'', ''Sacramento Union'', ''The New York Review of Books'', ''Business International'', the ''Grinnell Herald-Register'', ''Fortune'' magazine and the ''Tampa Tribune''.

Lion’s Share Group established the wholly owned subsidiary company Prague Post s.r.o. in March 1994 to take over the publishing of the newspaper, while Lion’s Share Group became a holding company.

===Chronological history===
'''1991'''

''The Prague Post'', located in a small room off Old Town Square in [[Prague]], debuted with a 12-page issue on 1 October 1991. The first paper covered news and business, offered a weekly calendar of listings and included a regular pub guide.

In late 1991, the paper moved to larger offices on Politických vězňů, off [[Wenceslas Square]], and increased to 16 pages.

'''1992'''
In February 1992, "Night &amp; Day", a redesigned and enlarged cultural listings section, was introduced. A regular features page concentrating on in-depth news, culture and lifestyle articles debuted in early May 1992.

The paper underwent extensive redesign, increased to 24 pages, switched street delivery days from Tuesdays to Wednesdays and moved printing operations to [[Frankfurt]], [[Germany]], on 18 November 1992. This enabled it to offer color capability to advertisers, higher quality print resolution and more timely international distribution. Several new regular sections appeared at this time including sports, "The Big Picture", a page devoted to news from Central and Eastern European regions and "East View", a column of material from other English-language newspapers in Central and Eastern Europe.

Kent Hawryluk’s day-to-day involvement with the newspaper ended in December 1992, and Lisa Frankenberg took over the responsibilities of publisher.  An additional suite of rooms was added to the offices at Politických vězňů and the staff continued to expand, along with the company’s investment in computers and publishing equipment.

'''1993'''
A monthly supplement devoted to special news coverage about [[Slovakia]] and entertainment listings for [[Bratislava]] was introduced in January, 1993, but was later curtailed as reporting became more difficult in Slovakia. In July 1993, "Summer in the City" was published as a tabloid insert for the remaining weeks of the summer. The tabloid included up-to-the-minute travel information for tourists, filling in where the guidebooks left off.

''The Prague Post'' launched special pullout sections on 1 September 1993: "Money &amp; Markets," "Travel &amp; Leisure" and "Real Estate." These sections, aimed at providing expert, specialized coverage, appeared on the first, second and third weeks of the month, respectively. The remaining week(s) of each month were filled with a series of special topics, including "Computers &amp; Technology", "The Modern Office", "Human Resources" and "Fashion." The special sections have changed and evolved over the years in response to readers’ needs.

The newspaper moved into newly reconstructed offices in the historic YMCA building at Na Poříčí 12 on 1 December 1993.

'''1994'''
''The Prague Post'' underwent a significant redesign on January 19, 1994, transforming the second section into the tabloid-size pullout "Night &amp; Day". This newly designed pullout consisted of articles detailing culture, features, listings, and a Prague Profile. It also introduced several new additions such as the Service Page, Ask Eva (an advice column), My Gene Pool (a cartoon strip) and reviews. The front section of the paper, consisting of news, business, sports and opinion also received a design improvement at this time.

Later in 1994, "Night &amp; Day" increased in size to include the classifieds section. At this time, the business editorial department also began publishing weekly researched industry lists that are included in the annual Book of Lists.

'''1995'''
The 1995 ''Book of Lists'', under development throughout 1994, was published in early 1995. An updated version of the ''Book of Lists'' was published annually until 2000.

This Gala event was a memorable evening, aptly marking a significant occasion in the life of the newspaper and its importance in the market.

''The Prague Post'' added sponsorship of the Prague International Marathon in the summer of 1996, and published a 12-page, four-color tabloid Holiday Shopping Guide for the month of December.

'''1997'''
In April 1997, ''The Prague Post'' was awarded first place for ‘Excellence in Newspaper Marketing’ by the International Newspaper Marketing Association for an in-house marketing campaign.

On 1 April 1997, ''The Prague Post'' launched its website at www.praguepost.cz (today it is "[http://www.praguepost.com www.praguepost.com]"). The initial site offered several top stories from the weekly newspaper as well as information for tourists and relocation information for people planning to move to Prague. It quickly gained a significant following, particularly with readers based outside the [[Czech Republic]].

'''1998'''
In May, 1998, Lisa Frankenberg returned from business school to resume an active role in the day-to-day operations of the newspaper as President and Publisher.

'''1999'''
The newspaper underwent another significant redesign near the end of 1999. Randy Stano, winner of two Pulitzer prizes for design, was recruited to undertake the process of re-designing the newspaper. ''The Prague Post'' was granted an Award of Excellence for re-design by the Society of News Design.

The offices of ''The Prague Post'' were relocated to a two-story office space at Štěpánská 20 in Prague 1.

In addition, the newspaper was profiled on [[BBC]], [[NBC]], [[CBS]] ([[60 Minutes]] and the [[CBS Evening News]]) and [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] (Prime Time Live and the ABC Evening News).

''The Prague Post'' was re-launched with its new design and format on 19 January 2000. Printing of the newspaper was moved from [[Frankfurt]] to a printing house in [[Prague]].

'''2001'''
''The Prague Post'' received three design awards from the Society of News Design in 2001. The website was re-designed and re-launched in the autumn 2001. Its new face attracted new and existing readers with an estimated 10,000 hits per day.

'''2002-2003'''
''The Prague Post'' introduced a successful new product – ''Dining Out Guide'' – first published in 2003. It is a guide to the finest culinary experiences in Prague.

'''2004'''
On 2 April 2004 [[Alan Levy]] died, aged 72. Two weeks later, ''The Prague Post'' said goodbye to its founding editor-in-chief in a public memorial service attended by numerous personalities of Czech political, business and cultural life.

'''2005'''
The company also worked toward improving the quality of the paper and the services provided, including the rest of its publishing portfolio – the ''Book of Lists'' and ''Dining Out Guide''.

'''2006'''
In 2006, ''The Prague Post'' proudly celebrated its 15th birthday. The night was in recognition of The Prague Post’s long-standing tradition as a reputable English-language newspaper in the [[Czech Republic]].

Former and current staff were recognized on the night for their contributions to the development and growth of the Czech Republic’s oldest and most popular English-language newspaper. [[Alan Levy]] was remembered and recognized on the night for his years of service and dedication to the paper.

'''2007'''
In 2007, two new supplements were added to the newspaper. The "Luxury Hotel Guide" was designed to provide an in-depth look into the luxury hotels around Prague, while the "Weddings" supplement offers insight into all facets of wedding planning.

In 2007, ''The Prague Post'' also helped with the revival of English-language theater in [[Prague]] with the launching of the first annual Prague Post Playwriting Contest.

===The Prague Post Endowment Fund===
The Prague Post Endowment Fund began as the Prague Post Foundation, a local non-profit organization founded in 1992. The goals were to enrich education and foster a place for the non-profit sector in the [[Czech Republic]].

In 1997, Czech laws changed to recognize the increasing role of non-profit organizations. The Prague Post Foundation became The Prague Post Endowment Fund. Educational materials were sent along with ''The Prague Post'' to more than 60 schools throughout the [[Czech Republic]]. The Fund provided scholarships and supported young journalists.

===''The Prague Post'' Playwriting Contest===
''The Prague Post'' Playwriting Contest started in 2007 with the goal of bringing together artists and the theater-going community. For its inaugural year, more than 100 scripts were submitted.

==History==
In 1880, '''Johann Popken''', the grandfather of Ulla Popken's husband Friedrich, founded a textile company in [[Hameln]]. During the 20th century, his son Karl operated the business until he stopped in 1960 due to failing health. Eight years later, Karl's son Friedrich and his wife Ulla took over operations. By 1978, the company had three stores in [[Bremen]], [[Hanover, Germany|Hanover]], and [[Hamburg]].

'''International Business School at Vilnius University''' or '''VU IBS''' ({{lang-lt|Vilniaus universiteto Tarptautinio verslo mokykla}}) is a private university in [[Lithuania]]. VU IBS was established by [[Vilnius University]], but now is an independent institution offering bachelor's, master's, and professional degrees in business, management and economics.

== About VU IBS ==

IBS is the first business school in Lithuania which was founded in 1989 during Lithuania‘s turbulent struggle for independence. IBS was the first educational establishment to launch international business curriculum during the beginning of Lithuania’s transitional period. Having received the United Nations Development Program (UNDP) support in providing scholars from overseas, IBS rapidly moved forward and its active development gave rise to the emergence of Bachelor and Master Degree study programmes in 1996. &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.linkedin.com/company/international-business-school-at-vilnius-university International Business School at Vilnius].

==Overview==

'''Whitfield''' is an ancient village, [[civil parish]] and [[Wards and electoral divisions of the United Kingdom|electoral ward]] in the English county of [[Kent]]. It has a modern counterpart in the large settlement located at the junction of the [[A2 road (Great Britain)|A2]] and [[A256 road]]s, some four miles (6.4&amp;nbsp;km) north of [[Dover]].

The village itself ([[Church Whitfield]]) can claim ancient roots in that evidence of both [[Roman Britain|Roman]] and [[Anglo-Saxons|Saxon]] settlements have been unearthed. The village church, dedicated to [[St Peter]], has two Saxon windows, and the bell is from the 13th century, or earlier. St. Peter's Church is a 10th Century Saxon Church largely rebuilt in Norman times, though the church is first mentioned in 762 AD. It was [[Victorian restoration|restored]] and enlarged in 1894.

There is also an early Congregational Chapel in the village (Chapel Rd) dating to 1781 but rebuilt in 1867. Whitfield also had its own windmill for many years, with a bakery beneath. It was built in about 1755 and was owned by generations of the Cadman family. In 1900 the mill was left to decay and was finally demolished in 1916 though the mill house still stands in Napchester Road.

The modern Whitfield began to appear when the more affluent citizens of Dover built their homes in "West Whitfeld", alongside what was to become the A2 trunk road which [[bypass (road)|bypass]]ed the village.&lt;ref&gt;"The Kent Village Book" Alan Bignell 1999 {{ISBN|1-85306-571-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Modern (post-Second World War) development enlarged the new village and in the 1960s Beauxfield was built then extended in the 1980s.

The 1970s saw with the introduction of Newlands, Cranleigh Drive and Farncombe Way. Again in 2005, the government proposed a maximum of 9,900 new homes to be built on [[greenfield site]]s around the village, doubling its size. The ''Whitfield Action Group'' was set up to oppose any large scale developments while accepting natural growth. It was confirmed in February 2010, that this figure will now be 6,000 new homes built.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.whitfieldactiongroup.co.uk/Whitfield Village Action Group]&lt;/ref&gt;

The main village of Whitfield along the 'Sandwich Road' has, as amenities, a [[public house]], 'The Archer'; the private members/function hall 'The Whitfield Club'&lt;ref&gt;[http://dover-kent.com/Whitfield-Club-Whitfield.html Clubs of Whitfield&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; Rolles Court Guest House and the Ramada Dover Hotel (formerly the Dover Motel). There is also a village hall with doctors surgery, vets, café, take aways, hairdresser and the local Post Office. A branch of [[McDonald's]] and [[Esso]] service station is located near the A2 roundabout at the top of ''''Whitfield''' Hill'. The village's older pub, the Royal Oak, closed in February 2008&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dover-kent.com/Royal-Oak-Whitfield.html ROYAL OAK (Whitfield) Pubs of Dover]&lt;/ref&gt; and a [[Marston's Brewery]] pub/restaurant, the 'Kittiwake', is now open at the junction of Menzies Road/Gordon Road.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dover-kent.com/Kittiwake-Whitfield.html Pubs of Whitfield&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; July 2015 saw the introduction of new [[KFC]], [[Pets at Home]] and [[B &amp; M]] stores on the ever-expanding Honeywood Retail Park, Honeywood Parkway.

The village has two schools, both of which also cater for special educational needs: primary and secondary. Whitfield and Aspen School (primary);&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.whitfield.kent.sch.uk/ Whitfield and Aspen School]&lt;/ref&gt; and Dover Christ Church Academy, formerly Archers Court School.&lt;ref&gt;[http://dccacademy.org.uk/ Dover Christ Church Academy]&lt;/ref&gt;

In view of its site on the periphery of a town such as Dover, and because of its strategic position on the A2/A256 junction, Whitfield is of importance to businesses. The huge White Cliffs Business Park,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dover.gov.uk/business/future_developments-flag.asp White Cliffs Business Park]&lt;/ref&gt; covering 272&amp;nbsp;acres (110&amp;nbsp;ha) is located at Whitfield and is described as attracting "… household names and a raft of companies with international pedigrees".

==Origins and Growth==

The village of Whitfield has grown so that it is now physically connected to urban Dover, Kent, yet it has kept its own identity and sense of place. The central core of modern Whitfield was, however, not the original heart of the village; the original settlement was sited at Church Whitfield to the east. Pineham, located to the east of Church Whitfield is a small rural hamlet that is often considered part of the Whitfield community. It contains a small handful of farms and houses.

Church Whitfield seems to have originated around a small, enclosed farmstead; archaeological work in the area showed that there was a collection of structures on the site during the early medieval period and evidence of both Roman and Saxon settlements. The Roman road from Dover (Dubris) to Richborough (Rutupiae) runs north-south near Pineham, suggesting that the village developed along its route.  The village church, dedicated to St Peter, is testament to this history; the church is a 10th Century Saxon structure largely rebuilt in Norman times, though the church is first mentioned in 762 AD. The building has two Saxon windows, and the bell dates from the 13th century.  The village was originally known as 'Bewsfield', which is said to refer to its high and open situation. It is thought that Whitfield began to be called 'Whytefeld' in the mid-seventeenth century.

At some point in the later medieval period, a new village was formed to the west. This may have been due to the Black Death, whereby many villages moved their centre of habitation a mile or two for fear of being too near the burial site of victims. The 'new' village became known as West Whitfield, before changing to Lower Whitfield and simply as 'Whitfield' as the village gradually grew. Old Whitfield to the northeast then became known as Church Whitfield. The villages developed quite different characters but maintained a close attachment in terms of physical proximity. Early maps such as the Andrews and Drury map of 1769, shows the basic arrangement of the villages, as separate, but linked hamlets.

Map research shows the small scale, village origins of Whitfield, before twentieth century expansion. The village was based around a roughly triangular road pattern, comprising Forge Lane/Lenacre Lane, Church Lane (now Napchester Road and Nursery Lane), and what is known today as The Drove. To the west, development was centred on Lenacre Court, although the original Lenacre Manor may originally have been located further south; a 'Lennickers' is shown on early nineteenth century maps, on roughly the location of Bewsbury Cross Farm. This development led along forge lane to the north, around Whitfield house, and towards the Congregational Chapel, originally built in 1781. To the east, development was clustered around the Windmill with a bakery beneath, originally built in 1755. The example at Whitfield was a smock mill, consisting of an octagonal, weather boarded tower, on a brick or masonry base. However, windmills suffered a rapid decline during the early twentieth century due to an influx of cheap imported grain and new government food regulations. Whitfield mill was demolished in 1916 after standing derelict for many years. This was originally a key focus to the village.

The village was linked to Church Whitfield and Pineham via Shepherds Cross to the north, and through a series of lanes and footpaths across the fields. It is clear that Whitfield was originally very rural in character with a tight knit collection of lanes in the oldest section of the village to the north of Nursery Lane. Map research shows however, that Whitfield was bisected in the early nineteenth century by the main Sandwich Road. The Mudge map of 1801 shows that a small lane or footpath had been built linking church lane to the crossroads at the top of forge lane. However, by the production of the first small scale ordnance survey maps in 1816, a main route running directly through the village from north to south had been constructed. This altered the village in a drastic manner, literally cutting the settlement in half – the reasoning behind the chosen route is unclear. The Royal Oak Public house dates from this time, built as a coaching stop along this main route to the improving harbour at Sandwich.

The modern Whitfield developed when more affluent citizens of Dover began to build new homes, alongside the junction of the A2 and A256 roads near the village. Gradually, the historic built form has been subsumed into the modern housing with no clear distinction created between the older segments of the village, and the modern growth. This has diluted the architectural character of Whitfield. As a result, Whitfield is now largely suburban in character, with remnants of the older village scattered throughout. There are a few elements within Whitfield that give some indication of the original character of the village, within the network of small lanes. Post housing dates from the post-war period. Where historic buildings survive, they show a strong tradition of brick and flint. In contrast, church Whitfield has retained a very rural character with a small cluster of houses and farms built around the church. The houses have however, been altered in form and are now mainly rendered and modernised. Post war development enlarged the village and in the 1960s new estates such as Beauxfield were built and extended in the 1980s. The Newlands, Cranleigh Drive and Farncombe Way were built in the 1970s.
