'''Auguste Faguet''' (1841–1886) was a noted 19th-century French botanical illustrator, well known for his contributions to major botanical works.

Auguste Faguet produced fine botanical [[wood engraving]]s to illustrate the works of [[Henri Ernest Baillon]]. For the ''"Dictionnaire de botanique"'', which appeared in 34 fascicles between 1876 and 1892, he produced 32 [[chromolithograph]]ed plates, published with each fascicle.

Faguet's drawings involve accurate perspective, his skill creating persuasive depth. Faguet's other work for Baillon included ''"Recherches des coniferes"'' of 1860, 1186 woodcuts in ''"Traite de botanique medicale phanerogamique"'' 1883-1884, 370 woodcuts in ''"Traite de botanique medicale cryptogamique"'' of 1889, ''"Loganiacees"'' of 1856 and ''"Bignoniacees"'' of 1864. Henri Faguet also did illustrations for [[Edouard Bureau]]'s ''"Monographie des bignoniacee"'' of 1864, [[Alfred Grandidier]]'s ''"Histoire physique, naturelle et politique de Madagascar"'' of 1875 and his ''"Histoire naturelle des plantes"'' that appeared between 1886 and 1903. Faguet also collaborated on a periodical, ''"L'Horticulteur Francais"'', between 1851 and 1872. His excellent woodcuts were overtaken by the renewed use of metal printing plates for botanical illustrations. Thiebault and Faguet illustrated Henri Baillon's ''"Histoire des plantes"'' (1866-1895). Faguet supplied engraved text figures for [[Georges Octave Dujardin-Beaumetz]] (1833-1895) &amp; [[Egasse]]'s ''"Les plantes medicinales indigenes ex exotique"'' of 1889, and contributed to ''"The Floral Register"'', a periodical which appeared between 1825 and 1851.

'''Beco do Batman''' (English: Batman's Alley) is the nickname for the area around Rua Gonçalo Afonso and Rua Medeiros de Albuquerque in the [[Vila Madalena]] neighborhood of São Paulo.&lt;ref name=SPTuris&gt;{{cite web|last1=Manara|first1=Amanda|title=Beco do Batman|url=http://www.cidadedesaopaulo.com/sp/br/o-que-visitar/atrativos/pontos-turisticos/3924-beco-do-batman|website=cidadedesaopaulo.com|publisher=Site oficial de turismo da cidade de São Paulo|accessdate=9 June 2015|language=pt}}&lt;/ref&gt; Beco do Batman is a popular tourist destination because of the dense concentration of [[graffiti]] that line the streets.

==History==
The nickname for the area is attributed to a graffito of the [[DC Comics]] character [[Batman]] which was painted on one of the walls in the 1980s.&lt;ref name=VejaSP&gt;{{cite web|last1=Dunder|first1=Karla|title=Vila Madalena: grafites fazem a fama do Beco do Batman|url=http://vejasp.abril.com.br/materia/vila-madalena-grafite-beco-do-batman|website=vejasp.abril.com.br|publisher=Veja SP|accessdate=9 June 2015|language=pt|date=15 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Local art students began filling the walls with other psychedelic and cubist influenced designs.&lt;ref name=SPTuris /&gt;&lt;ref name=BBC&gt;{{cite web|last1=Rocha|first1=Camilo|title=São Paulo unleashes Brazilian creative energy|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/10156816|website=bbc.co.uk|publisher=BBC News|accessdate=9 June 2015|date=28 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Vila Madalena received thousands of tourists during the [[2014 FIFA World Cup]] and there was a corresponding rise in reported incidents of robbery and assault in and around Beco do Batman during the period (2013–2014).&lt;ref name=Folha&gt;{{cite web|last1=Machado|first1=Leandro|title=Beco turístico na região da Vila Madalena vive onda de assaltos|url=http://www1.folha.uol.com.br/cotidiano/2014/12/1562008-beco-turistico-na-regiao-da-vila-madalena-vive-onda-de-assaltos.shtml|website=folha.uol.com.br|publisher=Folha de S.Paulo|accessdate=9 June 2015|language=pt|date=13 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The graffiti of Beco do Batman is now continually renovated and cared for by local community members.&lt;ref name=SPTuris /&gt;

&lt;!-- This organization's website no longer exists.  It is unknown whether the organization and its database still exists. --&gt;'''The Big Art Mob''' was a [[website]] founded in 2006 and re-launched in 2012 that provides a platform and toolset for documenting and mapping art visible in public, and was dedicated to showcasing and celebrating public art and ephemeral works such as [[street art]], [[performance art]] and [[graffiti]].  The site was conceived and created by [[Adam Gee (producer)|Adam Gee]] and [[Alfie Dennen]].

The crucial aim of the site was to create the first canonical record of all the public art in the world. The site also offered its own working definition of public art. Initially created to support the [[Channel 4]] documentary series ''[[The Big Art Project]]'', the site was spun off as a standalone site owned and administered by Art Public.  

This online documentation appears to no longer be active.  This website appears to no longer exists.

At the homepage of the Big Art Mob website were images, videos, and descriptive comments documenting [[public art]] in all its forms, and other news, as well as navigational tools for searching the site's voluminous archive (approximately 13,000 artworks mapped as of 04.09{{Clarify|date=September 2012|reason=ambiguous date format}} 2012).

The website's archive spanned back to June 2006. The archive could be searched by keyword, tag, artist name and location. The website had a twinned approach to achieving its aims: partnerships/relationships with institutions and a [[crowdsourcing]] approach.

[[File:The Bute Mazer's Wooden Lid (7921747638).jpg|thumb|The Bute Mazer's later [[whale bone]] cover]]
The '''Bute Mazer''', also known as the '''Bannatyne Mazer''' is a medieval communal feasting cup of a type known as a [[Mazer (drinking vessel)|mazer]]. The wood bowl and the elaborate [[silver-gilt]] "boss" in the centre are dated "fairly firmly" to between 1314 and 1327 from the [[heraldry]],&lt;ref&gt;Grant, 36&lt;/ref&gt; with the rim and cover about 1500.&lt;ref&gt;Grant, 38&lt;/ref&gt;  It is the oldest [[Kingdom of Scotland|Scottish]] mazer still surviving, and one of the oldest and most elaborate British ones. The cup has long been associated with the [[Isle of Bute]], on the west coast of Scotland. Its alternative name derives from Ninian Bannatyne, Laird of Kames, who owned the cup in the 16th century and had his name engraved on the rim.&lt;ref name=nms&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nms.ac.uk/our_collections/highlights/bute_or_bannatyne_mazer.aspx |title=Bute or Bannatyne mazer |publisher=[[National Museums Scotland]] |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100825103639/http://www.nms.ac.uk/our_collections/highlights/bute_or_bannatyne_mazer.aspx |archivedate=2010-08-25 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The mazer is now on loan from the Bannatyne family to the [[National Museum of Scotland]] in [[Edinburgh]].&lt;ref&gt;Grant, 34&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The Bute Mazer was probably commissioned by the FitzGilbert or Gilbertson family, whose arms appear twice, with further [[cinquefoil]]s used beside the shields.  They were a prominent family, but "did not quite rank with the great magnates" whose arms are also represented.&lt;ref&gt;Grant, 36&lt;/ref&gt;  It may have been used by [[Robert I of Scotland|King Robert the Bruce]] (reigned 1306–1329) at [[Rothesay Castle]] on Bute. Rothesay at this time was the seat of [[Walter Stewart, 6th High Steward of Scotland|Walter Stewart]], 6th [[High Steward of Scotland]] (1293–1326). The six coats of arms on the mazer represent six leading Scottish noble families, including that of Walter Stewart. Three of the coats of arms on the cup represent signatories of the [[Declaration of Arbroath]], a statement of Scottish independence written in 1320.&lt;ref name=nms/&gt;  

==Description==
The bowl of the cup is made of [[woodturning|turned]] [[Maple|maplewood]], while the foot is silver. Silver and silver-gilt hinged straps and a rim were added in the 16th century, when the cup was owned by the Bannatynes.  This work may have been carried out by Peter Lymeburner, a goldsmith in [[Glasgow]]. In the bottom of the bowl is a metal boss, decorated with a recumbent and grinning [[couchant]] lion in [[high relief]], who looks up at the viewer, and is surrounded by six coats of arms. 

The lion is [[casting|cast]] and creates hollows visible from underneath. It has red enamel eyes and was secured to the main plate of the boss by pins and [[solder]].  The rest of the plate is punched and [[engraving|engraved]] with [[wyvern]]s and [[cinquefoil]]s, and a [[strawberry]] plant trailing among the shields.&lt;ref&gt;Grant, 34-35&lt;/ref&gt;  On the outside, there are six decorated straps running between the rim and the foot, which date from the refurbishment in about 1500.&lt;ref&gt;Grant, 37&lt;/ref&gt;

Assuming the date around 1320 suggested by the heraldry, the mazer is "an ambitious concept constructed by a conservative and ultra cautious craftsman", almost certainly in Scotland.&lt;ref&gt;Grant, 34 (quoted), 35&lt;/ref&gt;  The style is somewhat dated by the standards of Paris or London, and the style of the lion seems to be based on [[Limoges enamel]] examples of over a century earlier.  The construction is very robust, and the execution of high quality.&lt;ref&gt;Grant, 37&lt;/ref&gt;  The filling between the shields and their circular frames is in a very early Scottish attempt at translucent [[basse taille]] enamel, only invented on the continent some forty years before, which is not entirely successful in terms of translucency.&lt;ref&gt;Grant, 37&lt;/ref&gt; 

The silver rim and the [[whale bone]] cover date from about 1500, and are less fine in quality; they are likely to have been replacements.&lt;ref&gt;Grant, 38&lt;/ref&gt;

===Heraldry===
[[File:The Bute Mazer Boss (or Print) (7968735430).jpg|thumb|Detail of the boss]]
The lion is thought by some to represent Robert the Bruce,&lt;ref name=nms/&gt; but considered too informal to do so by others,&lt;ref&gt;Grant, 37&lt;/ref&gt;  The six [[vitreous enamel|enamelled]] shields with [[coats of arms]] represent the families of six of Bruce's supporters (in clockwise order starting between the front paws of the lion):&lt;ref&gt;Grant, 35 (without all the detail)&lt;/ref&gt;

*[[House of Stewart]], as represented by Walter, the High Steward
*[[Clan Douglas|Douglas]], as represented by Bruce's companion, [[James Douglas, Lord of Douglas|Sir James Douglas]] (1286–1330)
*[[Walter fitz Gilbert of Cadzow|Walter FitzGilbert]] (died c.1346), ancestor of the [[Dukes of Hamilton]]
*John FitzGilbert, [[Baillie]] of Bute and possibly brother of Walter
*[[Clan Crawford|Crawford of Loudoun]]
*[[Earl of Menteith|Menteith]], a branch of the Stewart family

It has been observed that Douglas is at the lion's right hand, to represent Sir James Douglas' position as Bruce's principal commander, while Stewart is between the lion's paws, since Walter Stewart was married to the King's daughter [[Marjorie Bruce|Marjorie]]. Their son inherited the throne as [[Robert II of Scotland|King Robert II]] in 1371, the first monarch of the House of Stewart.

'''chameckilerner''' is a New York-based dance and video collective consisting of Rosane Chamecki and Andrea Lerner. Originally from [[Curitiba]], [[Brazil]], the duo was founded in 1992 primarily as a choreographic platform, but has since shifted their focus primarily to choreographing for the camera, video, and multi-channel installations. The shift in medium coincided with the premiere of their interdisciplinary performance EXIT at [[The Kitchen]] in 2007, which was deemed the "figurative killing off of the duo".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = BOMB Magazine — chameckilerner by Eve Sussman|url = http://bombmagazine.org/article/10020/chameckilerner|website = bombmagazine.org|access-date = 2016-02-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; They have been described as making use of "articulated movement ingrained in physical structures to define the psychological state of a body."

chameckilerner had their performance work presented at The Kitchen (2007); [[Dance Theater Workshop]] (1992, 1994, 1999, 2003); and [[Performance Space 122]] (1995), [[New York City|New York]], among others. In 2008 their first video work, Flying Lesson, premiered at the Dance on Camera Festival, [[Lincoln Center for the Performing Arts|Lincoln Center]], New York where it won the Jury Award for Best Film.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = FLYING LESSON|url = http://chameckilerner.com/flying-lesson/|website = chameckilerner.com|access-date = 2016-02-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2008 they were recipients of the [[Guggenheim Fellowship]], and have also received numerous grants and fellowships such as the Foundation for Contemporary Arts Grants to Artists award (1998), awards from [[New York State Council on the Arts|New York State Council on The Arts]], the [[Jerome Foundation]], and [[Experimental Media and Performing Arts Center|EMPAC]], and others. The duo has a forthcoming solo exhibition at Pierogi Gallery, Brooklyn, New York in February 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = chameckilerner at The Boiler|url = http://www.pierogi2000.com/2015/12/rosane-chamecki-and-andrea-lerner-at-the-boiler/|website = Pierogi Gallery|access-date = 2016-02-03|language = en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Christ in the House of His Parents''''' (1849–50) is a painting by [[John Everett Millais]] depicting the [[Holy Family]] in [[Saint Joseph]]'s carpentry workshop. The painting was extremely controversial when first exhibited, prompting many negative reviews, most notably one written by [[Charles Dickens]]. It catapulted the previously obscure [[Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood]] to notoriety and was a major contributor to the debate about [[Realism (arts)|Realism]] in the arts.

It is currently housed in the [[Tate Britain]] in London.

== Subject ==
The painting depicts the young Jesus assisting Joseph in his workshop. Joseph is making a door, which is laid upon his carpentry work-table. Jesus has cut his hand on an exposed nail, symbolizing the [[stigmata]] and foreshadowing Jesus' [[crucifixion]]. Some of the blood has fallen onto his foot. As Jesus' grandmother, [[Saint Anne|Anne]], removes the nail with a pair of pincers, his concerned mother, [[Blessed Virgin Mary|Mary]], offers her cheek for a kiss. Joseph examines Jesus' wounded hand. A young boy, who would later be known as [[John the Baptist]], brings in water to wash the wound, prefiguring his later baptism of Christ. An assistant of Joseph, who represents Jesus' future [[Twelve Apostles|Apostles]], observes these events. 

In the background of the painting various objects are used to further symbolize the theological significance of the subject. A ladder, referring to [[Jacob's Ladder]], leans against the back wall, and a [[dove]] which represents the [[Holy Spirit]] rests on it. Other carpentry implements refer to the [[Holy Trinity]]. Millais likely used [[Albrecht Dürer]]'s print ''[[Melancholia I]]'' as a source for this imagery, along with [[quattrocento]] works. The sheep in the [[Pen (enclosure)|sheepfold]] seen through the door represent the future Christian flock.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.victorianweb.org/religion/type/ch4b.html|title=Chapter 4. Typology in the Visual Arts -- Millais's Christ in the House of His Parents|work=victorianweb.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It has been suggested that Millais was influenced by [[John Rogers Herbert]]'s painting ''Our Saviour Subject to His Parents at Nazareth''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.victorianweb.org/painting/herbert/paintings/1.html|title=Our Saviour Subject to His Parents at Nazareth by John Rogers Herbert|work=victorianweb.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; He may also have drawn on a painting depicting Jesus helping Joseph in his workshop, which at the time was attributed to [[Annibale Carracci]].&lt;ref&gt;Catherine Roach, ''The Artist in the House of His Patron: Images-within-Images in John Everett Millais's Portraits of the Wyatt Family'', Visual Culture in Britain, 1 July, 2008 1, 1 March 2010, pp.67 – 92&lt;/ref&gt;

== Critical response ==
The painting was immensely controversial when first exhibited because of its realistic depiction of a carpentry workshop, especially the dirt and detritus on the floor. This was in dramatic contrast to the familiar portrayal of Jesus, his family, and his apostles in costumes reminiscent of Roman [[toga]]s. [[Charles Dickens]] accused Millais of portraying Mary as an alcoholic who looks

&lt;blockquote&gt;...so hideous in her ugliness that ... she would stand out from the rest of the company as a Monster, in the vilest cabaret in France, or the lowest gin-shop in England.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Critics also objected to the portrayal of Jesus, one complaining that it was "painful" to see "the youthful Saviour" depicted as "a red-headed Jew boy".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.engl.duq.edu/servus/PR_Critic/TB1jun50.html "The Royal Academy Exhibition." Builder 1 Jun. 1850, 255–256.]&lt;/ref&gt; Dickens described him as a "wry-necked, blubbering red-headed boy in a bed-gown, who appears to have received a poke...playing in an adjacent gutter".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.engl.duq.edu/servus/PR_Critic/HW15jun50.html Dickens, Charles. "Old Lamps for New Ones." Household Words 12 (15 Jun. 1850), 12–14.]&lt;/ref&gt; Other critics suggested that the characters displayed signs of [[rickets]] and other disease associated with slum conditions. Because of the controversy, [[Queen Victoria]] asked for the painting to be taken to [[Buckingham Palace]] so that she could view it in private.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tate.org.uk/britain/exhibitions/millais/millais_teachers_pack.pdf Tate Gallery, Teacher's pack] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080720174740/http://www.tate.org.uk/britain/exhibitions/millais/millais_teachers_pack.pdf |date=20 July 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the [[Royal Academy]] the painting was exhibited with a companion piece by Millais's colleague, [[William Holman Hunt]], that also portrayed a scene from early Christian history in which a family help a wounded individual. This was entitled ''[[A Converted British Family Sheltering a Christian Missionary from the Persecution of the Druids]]''.

== Consequences ==

The effect of the critical comments was to make the Pre-Raphaelite movement famous and to create a debate about the relationship between modernity, realism and [[medievalism]] in the arts. The critic [[John Ruskin]] supported Millais in letter to the press and in his lecture "Pre-Raphaelitism"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.liverpoolmuseums.org.uk/podcasts/pre-raphaelitism_ruskin.aspx|title=Podcast, Liverpool museums|work=liverpoolmuseums.org.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt; despite personally disliking the painting. The painting's use of [[symbolism (arts)|symbolic]] [[realism (arts)|realism]] led to a wider movement in which the choice of composition and theme was combined with detailed observation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.metmuseum.org/toah/hd/symb/hd_symb.htm|title=Symbolism|publisher=www.metmuseum.org|accessdate=2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[The Symbolists' rejection of naturalism and narrative in favor of the subjective representation of an idea or emotion would have a significant effect on the artwork of the twentieth century, ...]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Circassian beauties''' is a phrase used to refer to an idealized image of the women of the [[Circassians|Circassian people]] of the [[Northern Caucasus|Northwestern Caucasus]]. A fairly extensive literary history suggests that Circassian women were thought to be unusually beautiful, spirited, and elegant, and as such were desirable as [[concubine]]s.

This reputation dates back to the Late Middle Ages, when the Circassian coast was frequented by traders from Genoa, and the founder of the Medici dynasty, [[Cosimo de' Medici]], had [[Carlo de' Medici|an illegitimate son]] from a Circassian slave. During the [[Ottoman Empire]] and Persian [[Safavid]] and [[Qajar Dynasty|Qajar]] dynasties, Circassian women living as slaves in the Sultan's [[Imperial Harem]] and Shah's harems started to build their reputation as extremely beautiful and genteel, which then became a common [[trope (literature)|trope]] in Western [[Orientalism]].&lt;ref&gt;Irvin Cemil Schick, ''Çerkes Güzeli: Bir Şarkiyatçı İmgenin Serüveni'' [The Fair Circassian: Adventures of an Orientalist Motif], trans. A. Anadol (Istanbul: Oğlak Yayınları, 2004).&lt;/ref&gt;

As a result of this reputation, in Europe and America Circassians were often characterised as [[ideal of feminine beauty|ideals of feminine beauty]] in poetry and art. Cosmetic products were advertised, from the 18th century on, using the word "Circassian" in the title, or claiming that the product was based on substances used by the women of Circassia.

In consequence, most wives of several [[Ottoman Sultan]]s were ethnic Circassians converted to [[Islam]], e.g. [[Valide Sultan]]s (Empress mothers), including [[Rahime Perestu Sultan|Perestü Valide Sultan]], [[Pertevniyal Sultan|Pertevniyal Valide Sultan]], [[Şevkefza Sultan|Şevkefza Valide Sultan]], [[Tirimüjgan Sultan|Tirimüjgan Valide Sultan]], [[Nükhetsezâ Hanımefendi (wife of Abdul Hamid I)|Nükhetseza Başhanımefendi]], other important [[Khatun|Hatun]]s (Ladies) and [[Sultans]] like [[Şemsiruhsar Hatun]] and [[Ibrahim of the Ottoman Empire|Saçbağlı Sultan]], [[Haseki sultan]]s (chief consorts) such as [[Mahidevran Sultan|Mahidevran Haseki Sultan]], [[Hümaşah Sultan|Hümaşah Haseki Sultan]], [[Hatice Muazzez Sultan|Hatice Muazzez Haseki Sultan]], and [[Ayşe Hatun (wife of Osman II)|Ayşe Haseki Sultan]] besides numerous [[Kadınefendi|Başkadınefendi]]s (most senior consorts), including [[Bedrifelek Kadınefendi|Bedrifelek I]], [[Biydâr Kadın Efendi|Bidar II]], [[Kamures Kadınefendi|Kamures I]], and [[Servetsezâ Kadınefendi|Servetseza I]] as well as [[Kadınefendi]]s (senior consorts) such as [[Bezmican Kadınefendi|Bezmara VI]], [[Düzd-i Dil Kadın Efendi|Düzdidil III]], [[Hayranidil Kadınefendi|Hayranıdil II]], [[Meyliservet Kadınefendi|Meyliservet IV]], [[Mihrengiz Kadınefendi|Mihrengiz II]], [[Neşerek Kadınefendi|Neşerek III]], [[Abdul Hamid II#Second marriage and issue|Nurefsun II]], [[Reftar-i Dil Hatgil|Reftaridil II]], [[Şayan Kadınefendi (wife of Murad V)|Şayan III]], amongst many others, or [[Hanımefendi|İkbals]] (honoured lady consorts), most notable of them being [[Cevherriz Hanımefendi|Cevherriz II]], [[Abdülmecid I#Marriages and children|Ceylanyar II]], [[Dilfirib Kadınefendi|Dilfirib I]], [[Abdülmecid I#Marriages and children|Nalanıdil III]], and [[Abdülmecid I#Marriages and children|Nergis IV]] in addition to [[Hanımefendi|Gözde]]s (favourite lady consorts), including [[Abdul Hamid II|Dürdane I]], [[Abdülmecid I#Marriages and children|Hüsnicenan III]], [[Abdülmecid I#Marriages and children|Safderun IV]], amongst others. The "golden age" of the Circassian beauty may be considered to be between the 1770s, when the Russian Empire seized the [[Crimean Khanate]] and cut off their slave trade in Eastern European women, which increased the demand for Circassian women in Near Eastern harems; and the 1860s, when the Russians [[Circassian genocide|destroyed Circassia itself]].

In the 1860s the showman [[P. T. Barnum]] exhibited women who he claimed were Circassian beauties. They wore a distinctive curly, [[big hair]] style, which had no precedent in earlier portrayals of Circassians, but which was soon copied by other female performers in the United States, who became known as "moss-haired girls". This hair style was a sort of a exhibit's trademark and was achieved by washing the hair of women in beer, drying it and then teasing it.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Race, Showmen, Disabilities and the Freak Show|last=Bogdan|first=Robert|publisher=Routledge|year=2014|isbn=978-0-415-74393-8|location=NY|pages=200, 201}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is not clear why Barnum chose this hairstyle. It may have been a reference to the Circassian fur hat, rather than the hair.

There were also several classical Turkish music pieces and poems that praise the beauty of the "Lepiska Saçlı Çerkes" (Straight, [[blonde#flaxen|flaxen]]-haired Circassian; "lepiska" refers to long blonde hair which is soft and straight, as if flatironed).

The legend of Circassian women in the western world was enhanced in 1734, when, in his ''[[Letters on the English]]'', [[Voltaire]] alludes to the beauty of Circassian women:

{{Quote|The Circassians are poor, and their daughters are beautiful, and indeed it is in them they chiefly trade. They furnish with those beauties the [[seraglio]] of the Turkish Sultan, of the Persian [[Sophy (Safavid Empire)|Sophy]], and of all of those who are wealthy enough to purchase and maintain such precious merchandise. These maidens are very honorably and virtuously instructed how to fondle and caress men; are taught dances of a very polite and effeminate kind; and how to heighten by the most voluptuous artifices the pleasures of their disdainful masters for whom they are designed.|Letter XI, On Inoculation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.fordham.edu/halsall/mod/1778voltaire-lettres.html |title=Voltaire's Letters on the English |publisher= |accessdate=22 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; }}

Their beauty is mentioned in [[Henry Fielding]]'s ''[[The History of Tom Jones, a Foundling|Tom Jones]]'' (1749), in which Fielding remarked, "How contemptible would the brightest Circassian beauty, drest in all the jewels of the Indies, appear to my eyes!"&lt;ref&gt;Henry Fielding, ''Tom Jones'', book 5, ch. 10&lt;/ref&gt;

Similar erotic claims about Circassian women appear in [[Lord Byron]]'s ''[[Don Juan (Byron)|Don Juan]]'' (1818–24), in which the tale of a slave auction is told:

{{poemquote|
Some went off dearly; fifteen hundred dollars
For one Circassian, a sweet girl, were given,
Warranted virgin. Beauty's brightest colours
Had decked her out in all the hues of heaven.
Her sale sent home some disappointed bawlers,
Who bade on till the hundreds reached the eleven,
But when the offer went beyond, they knew
'Twas for the Sultan, and at once withdrew.
|''Don Juan'', canto IV, verse 114 }}

The legend of Circassian women was also repeated by legal theorist [[Gustav Hugo]], who wrote that "Even beauty is more likely to be found in a Circassian slave girl than in a beggar girl", referring to the fact that even a slave has some security and safety, but a "free" beggar has none. Hugo's comment was later condemned by [[Karl Marx]] in ''The Philosophical Manifesto of the Historical School of Law'' (1842) on the grounds that it excused slavery.&lt;ref&gt;[[Karl Marx|Marx, Karl]], [http://marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1842/08/09.htm The Philosophical Manifesto of the Historical School of Law]", first appearing in Supplement to the ''Rheiniche Zeitung'' No. 221, 9 August 1842. (Excerpts online)&lt;/ref&gt; [[Mark Twain]] reported in ''[[The Innocents Abroad]]'' (1869) that "Circassian and Georgian girls are still sold in [[Constantinople]] by their parents, but not publicly."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Twain |first=Mark |author-link=Mark Twain |date=1869 |chapter=34 |title=''[[The Innocents Abroad]]'' |publisher=American Publishing Company}}&lt;/ref&gt;

American travel author and diplomat [[Bayard Taylor]] in 1862 claimed that, "So far as female beauty is concerned, the Circassian women have no superiors. They have preserved in their mountain home the purity of the Grecian models, and still display the perfect physical loveliness, whose type has descended to us in the [[Venus de' Medici]]."&lt;ref name="Bayard Taylor"&gt;{{cite book |last=Taylor |first=Bayard |author-link=Bayard Taylor |date=1862 |chapter=Circassian Beauty |title=Prose Writings of Bayard Taylor |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=5HN_v61_E-cC&amp;dq=So%20far%20as%20female%20beauty%20is%20concerned%2C%20the%20Circassian%20women%20have%20no%20superiors.&amp;hl=en&amp;pg=PA155#v=onepage&amp;q=So%20far%20as%20female%20beauty%20is%20concerned,%20the%20Circassian%20women%20have%20no%20superiors.&amp;f=false |volume=7 |publisher=[[G.

An anthropological literary suggests that Circassians were best characterized by what was called "rosy pale" or "translucent white skin". While most [[Circassians#Circassian tribes|Circassian tribes]] were famous for abundance of fair or dark blond and red hair combined with greyish-blue or green eyes,&lt;ref name=Osmanoglu&gt;{{cite book |last=Osmanoğlu |first=Ayşe |date=1960 |title=Babam Abdülhamid |location=Istanbul |publisher=Güven Yayınevi |page=12}}&lt;/ref&gt; many also had the pairing of very dark hair with very light complexions, a typical feature of [[Peoples of the Caucasus]].&lt;ref name=ColarussoBeauties&gt;Colarusso, John 1989.

Pp. 644-651. Page 644: "The Circassians were famed throughout the Middle East for the beauty of their women and the courage of their men. Physically most Circassians are European in appearance with perhaps a slight oriental cast to their features. Many Circassians are blond and blue-eyed, while others show a common feature of the Caucasus: very light skin coupled with black or extremely dark hair. A lithe and erect physique were favored, both for the men and the woman, and many villages even today have large numbers of healthy elderly people, many over a hundred years of age."&lt;/ref&gt; Many of the Circassian women in the Ottoman harem were described as having "green eyes and long, dark blond hair, pale skin of translucent white colour, thin waist, slender body structure, and very good-looking hands and feet."&lt;ref name=Osmanoglu/&gt; The fact that Circassian women were traditionally encouraged to wear corsets in order to keep their posture straight might have shaped their [[wasp waist]] as a result. In the late 18th century, it was claimed by Western European coutouriers that "the Circassian Corset is the only one which displays, without indelicacy, the shape of the bosom to the greatest possible advantage; gives a width to the chest which is equally conducive to health and elegance of appearance."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Morison |first=Stanley |author-link=Stanley Morison |year=2009 |orig-year=1930 |chapter=The Fair Circassian |title=[[John Bell (publisher)|John Bell]], 1745–1831: A Memoir |format=Paperback |location=Cambridge |publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]] |publication-date=November 2009 |page=70 |isbn=978-0-521-14314-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In his book ''A Year Among the Circassians'', John Augustus Longworth describes a Circassian girl of typical Circassian features as the following: "She had regular and pretty features, blue eyes, and fair complexion; her hair was of a light auburn colour, and hung in a profusion of braided tresses over her shoulders, from a bonnet of scarlet cloth, trimmed and crossed with broad silver lace, not unlike the Albanian skull-cap. She was tall, and well, though slightly, shaped; and held herself, like all Circassians, men or women, very erect."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Longworth, Esq. |first=John Augustus |date=1840 |title=A Year Among the Circassians |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=NYGeRLRf7xsC&amp;dq=entitled%20to%20rank%20as%20a%20Circassian%20beauty.%20She%20had%20regular%20and%20pretty%20features%2C%20blue%20eyes%2C%20and%20fair%20complexion&amp;pg=PA60#v=onepage&amp;q=entitled%20to%20rank%20as%20a%20Circassian%20beauty.%20She%20had%20regular%20and%20pretty%20features,%20blue%20eyes,%20and%20fair%20complexion&amp;f=false |location=London |publisher=Henry Colburn |volume=1 |page=58}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is also understood from the memoirs of Princess Emily Ruete, a half-Circassian and half-Omani herself, that Circassian women, who were captured in Constantinople and brought to Africa for the harem of Zanzibari [[Said bin Sultan, Sultan of Muscat and Oman]], were envied by their rivals who considered Circassians to be of the "hateful race of blue-eyed cats."

{{Quote|At [[Sultan's Palace, Zanzibar|Bet il Sahel]] there was much more luxury and grand style than at Bet il Mtoni. The handsome and graceful Circassian women were much more numerous than at Bet il Mtoni, where my mother and her lady friend Medîne were the only members of this race. Here the majority of the women were Circassian, who without any doubt are much more distinguished in appearance....This natural superiority was the cause of a good deal of ill-will and envy. One Circassian woman, favoured with an aristocratic appearance, was avoided and even hated by the chocolate-coloured Abyssinian women through no fault of hers, but simply because she looked majestic. Under these circumstances it was bound to happen that occasionally a kind of ridiculous "racism" broke out among my brothers and sisters....We, the children of Circassian women, were usually called "cats" by those of our brothers and sisters who had Abyssinian blood in their veins, because some of us had the misfortune of possessing: blue eyes. Derisively they called us "Highness", a proof of how annoyed they were about us having been born with lighter skin. My father was of course never forgiven the fact that he had chosen his favourite children Sharîfe and Chole—both by Circassian mothers, Sharîfe even being blue-eyed—from the hateful race of "cats".&lt;ref name="Princess Emily Ruete"&gt;{{cite book |last=Ruete |first=Princess Emily |author-link=Emily Ruete |date=1993 |original-date= |title=An Arabian Princess Between Two Worlds: Memoirs, Letters Home, Sequels to the Memoirs |chapter=3 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=mU2w8K8IyoEC&amp;lpg=PA176&amp;dq=The%20handsome%20and%20graceful%20Circassian%20women%20were%20much%20more%20numerous&amp;hl=en&amp;pg=PA176#v=onepage&amp;q=The%20handsome%20and%20graceful%20Circassian%20women%20were%20much%20more%20numerous&amp;f=false |editor=E.

Regarding one of her half-sisters who was also from a Circassian mother, Princess Ruete of Zanzibar mentions that, "The daughter of a Circassian was a dazzling beauty with the complexion of a German blonde. Besides, she possessed a sharp intellect, which made her into a faithful advisor of my father's."&lt;ref name="Princess Emily Ruete"/&gt;

The characteristics of Circassian and Northwest Georgian women were further articulated in 1839 by the author Emma Reeve who, as stated by Joan DelPlato, differentiated "between 'the blond Circassians' who are 'indolent and graceful, their voices low and sweet' and what she calls the slightly darker-skinned Georgians who are 'more animated' and have more 'intelligence and vivacity than their delicate rivals'."&lt;ref name="DelPlato"&gt;{{cite book |last=DelPlato |first=Joan |date=2002 |chapter=Chapter 2.

Similar descriptions of the Circassian women appear in [[Florence Nightingale]]'s travel journal where Nightingale called Circassians "the most graceful and the most sensual-looking creatures I ever saw".&lt;ref name="DelPlato"/&gt;

According to the feminist [[Harriet Martineau]], Circassians were the only saving virtue of the Egyptian harem where these Circassian mothers produced the finest children and if they were to be excluded from the harem, the upper class in Egypt would be doomed.&lt;ref name="DelPlato"/&gt;

In parts of Europe and North America where blond hair was more common, the pairing of extremely white skin with very dark hair also present among some Circassians was exalted, even in Russia which was [[Russo-Circassian War|at war with the Circassians]]; Semyon Bronevskii exalted Circassian women for having light skin, dark brown hair, dark eyes and "the lineaments of the face of the Ancient Greek".&lt;ref&gt;King, Charles (2008). ''The Ghost of Freedom''. Page 135&lt;/ref&gt; In the United States, the girls disguised as "Circassians" exhibited by [[Phineas T. Barnum]] were in fact Catholic [[Irish people|Irish girls]] from [[Lower Manhattan]].&lt;ref name=King139&gt;King, Charles (2008). ''The Ghost of Freedom''. Page 139&lt;/ref&gt;

Circassian men were also exalted for their beauty, manliness and bravery in Western Europe, in a way Caucasus historian Charles King calls "homoerotic".&lt;ref name=KingHomoerotic&gt;King, Charles (2008). ''The Ghost of Freedom''.

Page 46&lt;/ref&gt; and upon the arrival of two Circassian leaders, Hadji Hayder Hassan and Kustan Ogli Ismael, the ''Dundee Advertiser'' reported that "the Chiefs are two remarkable looking men. Their imposing bearing, their romantic dress... and their natural dignity of mien, stamp them as very superior... Raven haired, black-bearded, broad-browed, with wide springing eyebrows of sooty black... these bronzed and armed children of the mountains tend to put us out of love with our own specimens of men, and suggests thoughts not complementary to the types of manhood which, in this country, they are surrounded."&lt;ref name=KingHomoerotic/&gt;

===Pseudoscientific explanations for the extreme white skin===
During the 19th century, various Western intellectuals offered [[Pseudoscience|pseudoscientific]] explanations for the light complexion present among Circassians. The [[doctor of medicine]] [[Hugh Williamson]], a signatory to the [[United States Constitution]], argued that the reason for the extreme whiteness of the Circassian and coastal [[Celtic people|Celto]]-[[Germanic peoples]] can be explained by the geographical [[Location (geography)|location]] of these folks' ancestral homelands which lie in high latitudes ranging from 45° to 55° N near a sea or ocean where [[Prevailing Westerlies|Westerlies]] prevail from the west towards the east.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Williamson |first=Hugh |author-link=Hugh Williamson |date=1811 |title=Observations of the Climate in different parts of America, compared with the Climate in corresponding Parts of the other Continent |location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Pseudoscientific racialist theories==
By the early nineteenth century, Circassians were associated with theories of racial hierarchy, which elevated the Caucasus region as the source of the purest examples of the "white race", which was named the [[Caucasian race]] after the area by [[Johann Friedrich Blumenbach]]. Blumenbach theorised that the Circassians were the closest to God's original model of humanity, and thus "the purest and most beautiful whites were the Circassians".&lt;ref&gt;Winthrop Jordan, ''White over Black'', Chapel Hill: University of North Carolina Press, 1968, pp. 222–3&lt;/ref&gt; This fuelled the idea of female Circassian beauty.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://chnm.gmu.edu/lostmuseum/searchlm.php?function=find&amp;exhibit=star&amp;browse=star |title=The Circassian Beauty Archive |publisher= |accessdate=22 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1873, the decade after the expulsion of Circassians from the Caucasus where only a minority of them live today, it was argued that "the Caucasian Race receives its name from the Caucasus, the abode of the Circassians who are said to be the handsomest and best-formed nation, not only of this race, but of the whole human family."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Cornell |first=Sarah S. |date=1873 |title=Cornell's Physical Geography: Accompanied with Nineteen Pages of Maps, a Great Variety of Map-questions, and One Hundred and Thirty Diagrams and Pictorial Illustrations, and Embracing a Detailed Description of the Physical Features of the United States |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=p6waAAAAYAAJ&amp;dq=The%20Caucasian%20Race%20receives%20its%20name%20from%20the%20Caucasus&amp;pg=PA75#v=onepage&amp;q=the%20abode%20of%20the%20Circassians,%20who%20are%20said%20to%20be%20the%20handsomest%20and%20best-formed%20nation,%20not%20only%20of%20this%20race,%20but%20of%20the%20whole%20human%20family&amp;f=false |publisher=[[Harvard University Press]] and [[D. Appleton &amp; Company]] |page=75}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another anthropologist [[William Guthrie (historian)|William Guthrie]] distinguished the Caucasian race and the "Circassians who are admired for their beauty" in particular by their oval form of their head, straight nose, thin lips, vertically-placed teeth, facial angle from 80 to 90 degrees that he calls the most developed one, and their regular features overall, which "causes them to be considered as the most handsome and agreeable".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Guthrie |first=William |author-link=William Guthrie (historian) |date=1843 |title=A new geographical, historical, and commercial grammar |editor=Richard Alfred Davenport |publisher=[[Oxford University Press]] |page=53}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Bayard Taylor]] observed the Circassian women during his trip to the Ottoman Empire and argued that, "the Circassian face is a pure oval; the forehead is low and fair, an excellent thing in woman, and the skin of an ivory whiteness, except the faint pink of the cheeks and the ripe, roseate stain of the lips."&lt;ref name="Bayard Taylor"/&gt;

Circassians are depicted in images of harems at this time through these ideologies of racial hierarchy. [[John Frederick Lewis]]'s ''The Harem'' portrays Circassians as the dominant mistresses of the harem, who look down on other women, as implied in the review of the painting in ''[[The Art Journal]]'', which described it as follows,

&lt;blockquote&gt;It represents the interior of a harem at Cairo, wherein is seated in luxurious ease a young Turk, attired in the excess of Moslem fashion. Near him, and reclining upon cushions, are two Circassian women, also dressed in the extremity of Oriental taste... On the right is seen a tall Nubian eunuch, who removes from the shoulders of an Egyptian slave the shawl by which she had been covered, in order to show her to the master of the harem; this figure with her high shoulders and the characteristics of her features, is a most successful national impersonation. The Circassian women look languidly to the Egyptian with an expression of supreme contempt, which is responded to by a sneer on the face of the Nubian eunuch.&lt;ref&gt;''Art Journal'', Review of the Old Water-colour Society Exhibition, 1850&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Orientalizing paintings of nudes were also sometimes exhibited as "Circassians".

The Circassians became major news during the [[Caucasian War]], in which [[Russia]] conquered the North Caucasus, displacing large numbers of Circassians southwards. In 1856 ''[[The New York Times]]'' published a report entitled "Horrible Traffic in Circassian Women — Infanticide in Turkey", asserting that a consequence of the Russian conquest of the Caucasus was an excess of beautiful Circassian women on the [[Constantinople]] slave market, and that this was causing prices of slaves in general to plummet.&lt;ref&gt;[http://chnm.gmu.edu/lostmuseum/lm/311/ Horrible Traffic in Circassian Women—Infanticide in Turkey]; ''New York Daily Times'', 6 August 1856&lt;/ref&gt; The story drew on ideas of racial hierarchy, stating that:

&lt;blockquote&gt;The temptation to possess a Circassian girl at such low prices is so great in the minds of the Turks that many who cannot afford to keep several slaves have been sending their blacks to market, in order to make room for a newly purchased white girl.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The article also claimed that children born to the "inferior" black concubines were being killed. This story drew widespread attention to the area, as did later conflicts.

At the same time writers and illustrators were also creating images depicting the authentic costumes and people of the Caucasus. [[Francis Davis Millet]] depicted Circassian women during his 1877 coverage of the [[Russo-Turkish War (1877–1878)|Russo-Turkish war]], specifying local costume and hairstyle.

==Advertising of beauty products==
[[File:Circassian hair dye.jpg|thumb|A poster from c. 1843 advertising Circassian Hair Dye]]

An advertisement from 1782 titled "Bloom of Circassia" makes clear that it was by then well established "that the Circassians are the most beautiful Women in the World", but goes on to reveal that they "derive not all their Charms from Nature". They used a concoction supposedly extracted from a vegetable native to Circassia. Knowledge of this "Liquid Bloom" had been brought back by a "well-regarded gentleman" who had traveled and lived in the region. It "instantly gives a Rosy Hue to the Cheeks", a "lively and animated Bloom of Rural Beauty" that would not disappear in perspiration or handkerchiefs.&lt;ref&gt;Bloom of Circassia, ''New-York Gazette'', 2 September 1782&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1802 "the Balm of Mecca" was also marketed as being used by Circassians: "This delicate as well as fragrant composition has been long celebrated as the summit of cosmetics by all the Circassian and Georgian women in the seraglio of the Grand Sultan". It claims that the product was endorsed by Lady [[Mary Wortley Montague]] who stated that it was very helpful "for removing those sebacious impurities so noxious to beauty". The article continues: "Any lady must be as great an Infidel as the Grand Sultan himself, who, after receiving such authority can doubt that her skin will become as superlatively smooth, soft, white and delicate, as that of the lovely Fatima, whatever may have been its feel or its appearance before. What fair one but must yield implicit faith, when she has the honour of the Countess De --- fairly pledged, that all sepacious [sic] impurities will be at once removed by this wonder-working nostrum. And above all, who but must long for an article, from the seraglio of the Grand Turk, which produces a near resemblance to the Georgian and Circassian beauties?"&lt;ref&gt;To the Ladies, ''New-York Herald'', 14 July 1802&lt;/ref&gt;

"Circassian Lotion" was sold in 1806 for the skin, at fifty cents the bottle. "A sovereign remedy for surfeits, scorching from the heat of the sun, freckles, blights from cold and chills of winter, scorbutic, pimples or eruptions of the face and skin, however violent or disfigured, animalcula generated under the cuticle or outer skin, prickley heat, shingles, ring worms, redness of the nose and chin, obstinate cutaneous diseases, and for every impurity or unnatural appearance with which the skin may be affected; to be used as a common wash for clearing and improving the complexion, and in a superior degree to preserve, soften, cleanse and beautify the skin".&lt;ref&gt;''Morning Chronicle' (NYC), 20 September 1806&lt;/ref&gt;

"Circassian Eye-Water" was marketed as "a sovereign remedy for all diseases of the eyes",&lt;ref&gt;Delaware Gazette and State Journal, 2 February 1815&lt;/ref&gt; and in the 1840s "Circassian hair dye" was marketed to create a rich dark lustrous effect.&lt;ref&gt;Thomas M Barrett (1998), Southern Living (in Captivity): The Caucasus in Russian Popular Culture, ''The Journal of Popular Culture'' 31 (4), 75–93.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Nineteenth-century sideshow attraction==
[[Image:Circassian.jpg|thumb|As a sideshow attraction, Circassian beauties were women with [[big hair]], a reference to the teased hair they wore, held in place by beer. Circassian ancestry was not required as in this example.]]

The combination of the popular issues of [[slavery]], the [[Orient]], racial ideology, and sexual titillation gave the reports of Circassian women sufficient notoriety at the time that the [[circus]] leader [[P. T. Barnum]] decided to capitalize on this interest. He displayed a "Circassian Beauty" at his [[Barnum's American Museum|American Museum]] in 1865. Barnum's Circassian beauties were young women with tall, teased hairstyles, rather like the [[Afro]] style of the 1970s.&lt;ref name="lind"&gt;Linda Frost, ''Never one nation: freaks, savages, and whiteness in U.S. popular culture, 1850–1877'', [[University of Minnesota Press]], 2005, pp. 68–88&lt;/ref&gt; Actual Circassian hairstyles bore no resemblance to Barnum's fantasy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://etc.usf.edu/clipart/23800/23851/Circassian_23851.htm |title=Circassian |publisher= |accessdate=22 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Barnum's first "Circassian" was marketed under the name "[http://chnm.gmu.edu/lostmuseum/lm/344/ Zalumma Agra]" and was exhibited at his American Museum in New York from 1864. Barnum had written to John Greenwood, his agent in Europe, asking him to purchase a beautiful Circassian girl to exhibit, or at least to hire a girl who could "pass for" one. However, it seems that "Zalumma Agra" was probably a local girl hired by the show, as were later "Circassians".&lt;ref&gt;[[Rosemarie Garland-Thomson]], ''Freakery: Cultural Spectacles of the Extraordinary Body'', [[New York University Press]], 1996, pp. 249–50&lt;/ref&gt; Barnum also produced a booklet about another of his Circassians, Zoe Meleke, who was portrayed as an ideally beautiful and refined woman who had escaped a life of sexual slavery.

The portrayal of a white woman as a rescued slave at the time of the [[American Civil War]] played on the racial connotations of slavery at the time. It has been argued that the distinctive hairstyle affiliates the side-show Circassian with African identity, and thus,

&lt;blockquote&gt;resonates oddly yet resoundingly with the rest of her identifying significations: her racial purity, her sexual enslavement, her position as colonial subject; her beauty. The Circassian blended elements of white Victorian True Womanhood with traits of the enslaved African American woman in one curiosity.&lt;ref name="lind"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The trend spread, with supposedly Circassian women featured in [[dime museum]]s and travelling [[medicine show]]s, sometimes known as "Moss-haired girls". They were typically identified by the distinctive hairstyle, which was held in place by the use of beer. They also often performed in pseudo-oriental costume. Many postcards of Circassians also circulated. Though Barnum's original women were portrayed as proud and genteel, later images of Circassians often emphasised erotic poses and revealing costumes.&lt;ref name="lind"/&gt; As the original fad faded, the "Circassians" started to add to their appeal by performing traditional circus tricks such as [[sword swallowing]].&lt;ref&gt;Robert Bogdan, ''Freak Show: Presenting Human Oddities for Amusement and Profit'', [[University of Chicago Press]], 1990, p. 240&lt;/ref&gt;

==In popular culture==
*[[The Safety Fire]], British [[progressive metal]] band, released their song "[[Grind the Ocean|Circassian Beauties]]" in 2012.
*The American [[alternative rock]] band [[Monks of Doom]] released another song with the title "Circassian Beauty" in their 1991 album ''Meridian''.

'''Ciudad Vieja''' ({{IPA-es|θjuˈðað ˈβjexa}}, ''Old City'') is the name of the oldest part of the [[city]] of [[Montevideo]], capital city of [[Uruguay]]. Nowadays, Ciudad Vieja is a ''[[barrio]]'' (neighbourhood or district) of this city. In the last couple of years it has gone through a major transformation that has made it the main nightlife centre in town. It is in this area where most of the [[nightclubs]] are, and also it hosts the 'Mercado del Puerto' a traditional venue for Uruguayan food and beverages. The main port of Uruguay (being the main Big Draft port in southern South America) is located in Ciudad Vieja.

Part of this transformation is due to the campaign made by the [[Municipal Intendent of Montevideo|mayor]] since this part of the city had been in a state of abandonment for decades.

== Early history ==

Until 1829 it was surrounded by a wall that protected it from possible invasions. After the wall was torn down, the only part of it that was kept was its [[Ciudadela, Montevideo|gateway]], which is up to this day an [[emblem]] of this part of town. Some streets remind the presence of the wall, like Ciudadela (''[[citadel]]'') or [[Brecha (street)|Brecha]] (''breach''), which has this name because it was near but at this point that the British managed to open a breach on the wall during the [[British invasions of the Río de la Plata#Second invasion - 1807|1807 British invasion]]. The old street Sarandí was turned into a pedestrian walkway in 1992, which increased its commercial and tourist attractiveness. In 2005 it was extended to beyond the [[Constitution Square (Montevideo)|Constitution Square]].

Ciudad Vieja has the most beautiful buildings from the colonial era and the first decades of independence. The [[Montevideo Cabildo|Cabildo]] (built between 1804 and 1812), the [[Solís Theatre]], the [[Montevideo Metropolitan Cathedral|Metropolitan Cathedral]] and several museums, like the [[Museo Torres García]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.torresgarcia.org.uy Torres Garcia Museum]&lt;/ref&gt; are among the most impressive ones. Also several design shops and recycled loft floors flourish in the streets near the port.

== Places of worship ==
Several temples have been built in the historic heart of the city:
* [[Montevideo Metropolitan Cathedral|Cathedral of the Immaculate Conception, St. Philip and St. James]] (head of the Roman Catholic Church in Uruguay) 
* [[Parroquia San Francisco de Asís, Montevideo|Parish Church of St. Francis of Assisi]] (Roman Catholic)
* [[Nuestra Señora de Lourdes y San Vicente Pallotti, Montevideo|Church of Our Lady of Lourdes and St. Vincent Pallotti]] (Roman Catholic, [[Pallottines]])
* [[Capilla de la Caridad del Hospital Maciel, Montevideo|Charity Chapel, Maciel Hospital]] (Roman Catholic, Hospitaller Sisters of the Sacred Heart of Jesus)
* [[Cathedral of The Most Holy Trinity, Montevideo|Cathedral of The Most Holy Trinity]], popularly known as the English Temple ([[Anglican]])

'''The Council of Architecture''' ('''COA''') is a body corporate by the [[Government of India]] under the provisions of the Architects Act, 1972, enacted by the [[Parliament of India]], which came into force on 1 September 1972. The Act provides for registration of Architects, standards of education, recognized qualifications and standards of practice to be complied with by the practicing architects. The Council of Architecture is charged with the responsibility to regulate the education and practice of profession throughout India besides maintaining the register of architects. For this purpose, the Government of India has framed Rules and Council of Architecture has framed Regulations as provided for in the Architects Act, with the approval of Government of India.

==Overview==
Any person desirous of carrying on the profession of '[[Architect]]' must have registered himself with Council of Architecture. For the purpose of registration, one must possess the requisite qualification as appended to the Architects Act, after having undergone the education in accordance with the Council of Architecture (Minimum Standards of Architectural Education) Regulations, 1983. The registration with Council of Architecture entitles a person to practice the profession of architecture, provided he holds a Certificate of Registration with up-to-date renewals. The registration also entitles a person to use the title and style of Architect. The title and style of architect can also be used by a firm of architects, of which all partners are registered with COA. Limited Companies, Private/Public Companies, societies and other juridical persons are not entitled to use the title and style of architect nor are they entitled to practice the profession of architecture. If any person falsely claims to be registered or misuses title and style of architect, such acts tantamount to committing of a criminal offence, which is punishable under section 36 or 37 (2) of the Architects Act, 1972.

The practice of profession of an architect is governed by the Architects (Professional Conduct) Regulations, 1989 (as amended in 2003), which deals with professional ethics and etiquette, conditions of engagement and scale of charges, architectural competition guidelines etc. Pursuant to these Regulations, the Council of Architecture has framed guidelines governing the various aspects of practice. An architect is required to observe professional conduct as stipulated in the Regulations of 1989 and any violation thereof shall constitute a professional misconduct, which will attract disciplinary action as stipulated under section 30 of the Architects Act, 1972.

==Functions==
As of July 2018, there are 463 approved institutions,&lt;ref name=CoA&gt;{{cite web |title=Status with Intake of Architectural Institutions in India As on July 24, 2018 |url=https://www.coa.gov.in/show_img.php?fid=396 |publisher=Council of Architecture |accessdate=24 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; which impart architectural education in India leading to recognized qualifications. The standards of education being imparted in these institutions (constituent colleges/departments of universities, deemed universities, affiliated colleges/schools, IITs, NITs and autonomous institutions) is governed by Council of Architecture (Minimum Standards of Architectural Education) Regulations, 1983, which set forth the requirement of eligibility for admission, course duration, standards of staff &amp; accommodation, course content, examination etc. These standards as provided in the said Regulations are required to be maintained by the institutions. The COA oversees the maintenance of the standards periodically by way of conducting inspections through Committees of Experts. The COA is required to keep the Central Government informed of the standards being maintained by the institutions and is empowered to make recommendations to the Government of India with regard to recognition and de-recognition of a qualification.

The '''''Danza de los Voladores''''' ({{IPA-es|ˈdansa ðe loz βolaˈðoɾes}}; "Dance of the Flyers"), or '''''Palo Volador''''' ({{IPA-es|ˈpalo βolaˈðoɾ|pron}}; "flying pole"), is an ancient [[Mesoamerica]]n ceremony/ritual still performed today, albeit in modified form, in isolated pockets in Mexico. It is believed to have originated with the [[Nahua peoples|Nahua]], [[Huastec people|Huastec]] and [[Otomi people|Otomi]] peoples in central Mexico, and then spread throughout most of Mesoamerica.  The ritual consists of dance and the climbing of a 30-meter pole from which four of the five participants then launch themselves tied with ropes to descend to the ground. The fifth remains on top of the pole, dancing and playing a flute and drum.  According to one myth, the ritual was created to ask the gods to end a severe drought. Although the ritual did not originate with the [[Totonac]] people, today it is strongly associated with them, especially those in and around [[Papantla]] in the Mexican state of [[Veracruz]].&lt;ref name="wilkerson7576"&gt;{{Cite book|title= El Tajin: A Guide for Visitors |last= Wilkerson |first= S.

According to Totonac myth, at least 450 years ago{{When|date=September 2018}} there was a severe drought that brought hunger to the people. The gods were withholding the rain because the people had neglected them.  The ceremony was created, to appease the gods and bring back the rains. In some versions of the story, the ritual is created by the old men of a village, who then chose five young men who were chaste. In other versions, the five men themselves create the ritual. The tallest tree in the nearby forest is cut down, with the permission of the mountain god, stripped of branches and dragged to the village. The trunk is erected with much ceremony. The youths climb the pole and four jump off while the fifth played music. The ritual pleased the rain god [[Xipe Totec]] and other gods, so the rains began again and the fertility of the earth returned.&lt;ref name="inahvol"/&gt;&lt;ref name="leyendas"&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.municipiopapantla.gob.mx/content/view/94/17/ |title=LEYENDAS DE LOS VOLADORES |publisher=Municipality of Papantla |location=Papantla, Mexico |language=Spanish |trans-title=Legends of the Voladores |accessdate=11 February 2010 }}{{dead link|date=September 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The participants were thought to impersonate birds and in some areas were dressed as [[parrot]]s, [[macaw]]s, [[quetzal]]s and eagles. These birds represented the gods of the earth, air, fire, and water. By the 16th century, the ritual was strongly associated with solar ceremonies, such as the spring equinox.&lt;ref name="wilkerson75"/&gt;&lt;ref name="vuelan"&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.municipiopapantla.gob.mx/content/view/21/30/ |title=El lugar de los Hombres que Vuelan |publisher=Municipality of Papantla |location=Papantla, Mexico |language=Spanish |trans-title=The place of the Men that Fly |accessdate=11 February 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090626163359/http://www.municipiopapantla.gob.mx/content/view/21/30/ |archivedate=26 June 2009 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The ritual is most closely tied with rain and solar deities such as Xipe, Totec and Tlazotlteotl.&lt;ref name="itesmorigenes"/&gt;

In [[Maya mythology]] the creation of the world is associated with a mythical bird deity ([[Itzamna#Principal Bird Deity|Itzamna]]) residing at the [[Mesoamerican world tree|World Tree]] (the center of the world). Five "birdmen" at the top of a pole represent bird deities. The main dancer stands in the center and plays a flute, which represents the sound of birds singing. The four other "birdmen" (representing the four directions) spin around the pole to represent the recreation of the world (and the regeneration of life)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last = Coppens | first = Philip | title = Rebuilding Creation | publisher = Philipcoppens.com  | url = http://www.philipcoppens.com/rebuildingcreation.html  | accessdate = 2010-09-06 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the early form, instead of only five men there are six men dressed as birds with each member climbing on top and performing a dance and at the end tied ropes around their waist and who all jump in unison and descend downwards.  Many villages in Mexico banned this version of the practice due to injuries and even death.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=Nd8DAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA104&amp;dq=1954+Popular+Mechanics+January&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=Q3YzT6TaKu2o0AHgjvW_Ag&amp;ved=0CDMQ6AEwATgK#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=true "The Weird Birdsmen of Mexico"] ''Popular Mechanics'', pp. 104-105.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Diego Durán]], who recorded many Aztec customs at the time of the Spanish conquest, described an incident reminiscent of the Danza de los Voladores, where an Aztec prince, Ezhuahuacatl, sacrificed himself by diving from a pole 20 ''brazas'' high (probably about 120 feet, a ''braza'' being roughly a [[fathom]], i.e. c. 6 feet).&lt;ref&gt;Durán, Diego (1994) ''The History of the Indies of New Spain'', translated and annotated by Doris Heyden, University of Oklahoma Press, p. 143.&lt;/ref&gt;  The four modern day voladores typically circle the pole 13 times each, for a total of 52 circuits, or the number of years in the [[Aztec calendar|Aztec "calendar round"]].&lt;ref&gt;Heyden, p. 143.&lt;br&gt;Headrick, Annabeth (2002) "The Great Goddess at Teotihuacan" in Andrea Stone, ed. ''Heart of Creation: the Mesoamerican World and the Legacy of Linda Schele'', [[University of Alabama Press]], Tuscaloosa, Alabama, {{ISBN|0-8173-1138-6}}, pp. 88-89.&lt;/ref&gt;

The ritual was partially lost after the [[Spanish conquest of the Aztec Empire|Conquest]], and the Spaniards destroyed many records about it.  The Church was much against "pagan" rituals such as these after the Conquest and this and many other rituals were silenced or practiced in secret. Much of what is known is due to oral tradition and writing by the first Europeans to come to Mexico. Later, Catholic elements would be added to the ritual, and it became something of a spectacle in the later colonial period. The ritual mostly disappeared in Mexico and Central America with small remnants surviving, including the Totonac people.&lt;ref name="vuelan"/&gt;

Although the ritual did not originate with the Totonacs, today it is often associated with the Totonacs of the Papantla area in Veracruz.&lt;ref name="itesmorigenes"/&gt;&lt;ref name="adominguez"/&gt; In modern times, a number of changes have occurred. Due to the deforestation of much of the Sierra de Puebla and mountain areas of Veracruz, most voladores perform on permanent metal poles, which in Veracruz are often donated by the oil industry.&lt;ref name="wilkerson75"/&gt;  The most controversial change has been the induction of women to perform the ceremony. Traditionally, it has been taboo to allow women to become voladores but a few have become such, all of whom are in Puebla state. One of the first males to train women, Jesús Arroyo Cerón, died when he fell from a pole during the Cumbre Tajín 2006 cultural festival&lt;ref name="cumbre_tajin2006"&gt;{{Cite news|title= Cae volador de Papantla del palo ceremonial durante la Cumbre Tajín |first=Andres T |last=Morales |url= http://www.jornada.unam.mx/2006/03/21/index.php?section=espectaculos&amp;article=a09n1esp |newspaper=La Jornada |location=Mexico City |date=2006-03-21 |accessdate=2018-05-08 |language=Spanish |trans-title= Volador of Papantla falls from ritual pole during Cumbre Tajín }}&lt;/ref&gt;.

==Versions==
In addition to whether or not there is a pole ceremony, other variations in the ritual exist. Among the Nahua and Otomi peoples, there is generally no dance before climbing the pole; the ceremony begins at the top. There is also a version where the suspended frame has five sides instead of four and the ritual involves six dancers and not five. The most traditional time to perform this version is on Holy Thursday at the culmination of a festival held on this day called the Huapangueada. Some dancers have rules to follow such as needing to fast for one or more days before the ceremony and abstain from sexual relations so that the gods will look upon the ceremony favorably.&lt;ref name="adominguez"/&gt;  Most of the variations are found in Puebla state.&lt;ref name="vuelan"/&gt;
However, the most controversial variation is whether or not to permit women to perform the ritual. In Papantla, which is the community most closely associated with the ritual. The Consejo de Ancianos Totonacas (Council of Totonac Elders) has formally prohibited the inclusion of women. Traditionally, women have been excluded from all Totonac ritual dancing.&lt;ref name="mujeres"/&gt; Even for the dance called La Maringuilla, the female protagonist is portrayed by a man.&lt;ref name="adominguez"/&gt;  The prohibition stems from the belief that women are “bad entities, who bring bad luck” and their inclusion would be a sin and/or anger the gods.&lt;ref name="mujeres"/&gt;

However, in a few communities, such as [[Cuetzalan]]  and [[Pahuatlán]] in Puebla and [[Zozocolco de Hidalgo]] in Veracruz, women have been allowed to be voladores.&lt;ref name="adominguez"/&gt;&lt;ref name="mujeres"/&gt;  Those who are allowed to take part must first complete a series of rituals designed to ask the forgiveness of the gods and Catholic saints for being a woman.&lt;ref name="mujeres"/&gt; The women must also be virgins without a boyfriend if unmarried or abstain from sexual relations before the ritual if married. If a female volador is found to have broken the rules of sexual abstention, she is taken to an altar which is surrounded by incense burners and candles. An image of the [[Archangel Michael]] or [[James, son of Zebedee|Saint James]] bears witness to the punishment, which involves a number of slaps to the face (bofetadas), with the quantity depending on the transgression and the decision of those in charge. It is claimed that the ritual cures “the fever” of the woman. It is believed that women who do not obey these rules will bring calamity to the ritual.&lt;ref name="mujeres"/&gt;

It is not known when the first female was allowed to take part as a volador.&lt;ref name="adominguez"/&gt;  One of the first men to train women was Jesús Arroyo Ceron, who trained his daughter Isabel in 1972; after this, he trained his other three daughters. In March 2006, aged 70, he fell from a pole during the Cumbre Tajín celebrations and died. Family members believe he fell “at the side of the gods,” but many patriarchs believe the accident was divine retribution. A wooden cross and flowers at the Plaza del Volador in Parke Takilhsukut memorialize him.&lt;ref name="mujeres"/&gt;  Approximately twenty female voladores are known to exist.&lt;ref name="vuelan"/&gt;

In [[Guatemala]] the flying pole dance, called ''Palo volador'', is still celebrated in [[Joyabaj]] (15 August), [[Chichicastenango]] (17–23 January) and [[Cubulco]] (26 July).&lt;ref name="elPeriodico2010-01-17"&gt;Escobar. Lucía.

===Totonac version===
According to Totonac myth, the gods told men, “Dance, and we shall observe.”  Today, pleasing the gods of old is still a part of the most traditional version of the ritual.&lt;ref name="mexdes1"&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.mexicodesconocido.com.mx/notas/6344-Los-voladores-de-Papantla-%28Veracruz%29 |title=Los voladores de Papantla (Veracruz) |publisher=Mexico Desconocido magazine |location=Mexico City |language=Spanish |accessdate=11 February 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090418010531/http://www.mexicodesconocido.com.mx/notas/6344-Los-voladores-de-Papantla-%28Veracruz%29 |archivedate=18 April 2009 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Totonac dress for this ritual consists of red pants with a white shirt, a cloth across the chest and a cap. The pants, hat and chest cloth are heavily embroidered and otherwise decorated. The cloth across the chest symbolized blood. The hat is adorned with flowers for fertility; mirrors represent the sun and from the top stream multicolored ribbons representing the rainbow.&lt;ref name="wilkerson75"/&gt;&lt;ref name="vuelan"/&gt;  These costumes are made by the voladores themselves and can cost between 5,000 and 8,000 pesos each.&lt;ref name="vuelan"/&gt;

The most traditional and lengthy version starts from the selection and cutting of the tree to be used, to the final dance after all voladores have descended from the pole. The tree selection, cutting and erecting ceremony is called the tsakáe kiki. It involves going into the forest to find a suitable tree and asking the permission or the pardon of the mountain god Quihuicolo for taking it. The tree is stripped of its branches and dragged to the ceremonial site, where a hole has been dug for the now-30-meter pole. Before erecting the pole, offerings of flowers, copal, alcohol, candles and live chickens or a live turkey are placed in the hole. These are then crushed as the pole is erected, adding to the fertility of the earth.&lt;ref name="inahvol"/&gt;&lt;ref name="vuelan"/&gt; The pole becomes a connection point between the sky and the earth and the underworld with the surface world, a representation of the [[Mesoamerican world tree|world tree]], and considered to be the fifth cardinal direction of the earth.&lt;ref name="vuelan"/&gt;&lt;ref name="itesmritual"&gt;{{Cite web|url= http://www.mty.itesm.mx/dhcs/deptos/co/co95-832/Proy_2002_S1/VoladoresPapantla/html/t-ritual.htm |title=Ritual  |publisher=[[ITESM]] |location=Monterrey, Mexico |language=Spanish |accessdate=11 February 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The post and the dancers are then purified with alcohol sprinkled in the form of a cross and  tobacco smoke.&lt;ref name="vuelan"/&gt;

In most cases, however, the pole used is a permanently placed one, often of steel, and this part of the ceremony does not take place. On these occasions, the ceremony begins with a dance and song type called a “[[son (music)|son]].” Usually the initial song played and danced to is called the “son of forgiveness.”&lt;ref name="itesmritual"/&gt;  After this, the five begin to climb the pole with the chief or “caporal” going first. The caporal will not descend but rather will stay at the top of the pole until near the end of the ceremony.&lt;ref name="vuelan"/&gt; The caporal stands on a [[Capstan (nautical)|capstan]], called a manzana (apple) which is a small platform at the top of the pole. From this capstan is suspended a square frame called a cuadro (square) on which the other four voladores sit. While these four wind the ropes around the pole and tie themselves to the ends, the caporal plays the flute and drum acknowledging the four cardinal directions, beginning with the east because it is believed life came from this direction. The four ropes are each wound thirteen times for a total of fifty-two, the number of years in a Mesoamerican great year.  The caporal then bends fully backwards to acknowledge the sun, playing all the while.&lt;ref name="vuelan"/&gt;&lt;ref name="itesmritual"/&gt;&lt;ref name="wilkerson76"&gt;{{Cite book|title= El Tajin: A Guide for Visitors |last= Wilkerson |first= S. Jeffrey K |year=1987 |isbn=968-499-293-9 |page=76 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The four voladores represent the four cardinal directions as well as the four elements: earth, air, fire and water. The caporal represents the fifth sun. The four voladores seated on the cuadro face the caporal and at the appropriate moment fall backwards to descend to the ground suspended by the wound ropes. As the ropes unwind, the voladores spin, creating a moving pyramid shape. As the other voladores descend, the caporal plays  the “son of goodbye” and dances on the narrow platform.&lt;ref name="vuelan"/&gt;&lt;ref name="mexdes1"/&gt;  Traditionally, after the descent, there is another dance of goodbye.&lt;ref name="vuelan"/&gt;

==Intangible Cultural Heritage and conservation of the tradition==
[[File:Voladores from Veracruz performing in Puerto Vallarta.jpg|thumb|Voladores displaying their costumes used in performance in Puerto Vallarta]]
[[File:Rito de los voladores.jpg|thumb|Voladores in Teotihuacan]]
The Ritual Ceremony of the Voladores of Papantla was recognized as [[Intangible cultural heritage]] (ICH) by [[UNESCO]] in 2009. This is the second Mexican event to be so recognized, with the first being the Indigenous Festivity of the Dead in 2008. Governor [[Fidel Herrera Beltrán]] received the award in the name of the people and the government of Veracruz, and especially the indigenous people of the Totonacapan region of the state. Celebrations of the recognition took place on October 12, 2009, in Takilhsukut Park at [[El Tajín]] and other volador sites in Mexico.&lt;ref name="mcclat"/&gt; The ritual was inscribed along with the Traditions of the Otomi-Chichimecas of Toliman, Peña de [[Bernal, Querétaro]].&lt;ref name="toliman"&gt;{{Cite news|title= Voladores de Papantla y tradiciones de Tolimán, patrimonio de la humanidad |url= http://www.jornada.unam.mx/2009/10/01/index.php?section=cultura&amp;article=a06n1cul |agency= Periódico La Jornada |newspaper=La Jornada |location=Mexico City |date= 2009-10-01 |page=6 |accessdate=2010-02-11 |language=Spanish |trans-title=Voladores of Papantla and traditions of Toliman, world heritage }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The recognition carries the responsibility for Mexico to safeguard and promote the tradition to keep it alive. A part of the nomination process was an extensive regional plan of preservation, promotion and development of the cultural heritage in Veracruz and other parts of Mexico and Central America.&lt;ref name="mcclat"/&gt;&lt;ref name="inahvol"/&gt;
One effort that has been underway is the establishment of the Escuela de Niños Voladores (School of Volador Children), which is located at Takilhsukut Park and is the first formal school for voladores. It has a student population of between 70 and 100 students who learn about the history, significance and values associated with the ritual from the pre-Hispanic period. These include those associated with the taking of the pole, called a tsakáe kiwi, from the forest, an aspect of the ritual that is in danger of extinction. The school is sponsored by the Veracruz state government and children begin attending between 6 and 8 years of age. Most come from the neighboring communities of Plan de Hidalgo, El Tajín, San Lorenzo and Arroyos del Arco and Oxital, and whose fathers and grandfathers are voladores. The school requires students to meet certain requirements, such as being able to speak Totonac and girls are not permitted. However, most voladores learn the ritual from their fathers and grandfathers starting at age eight or ten.&lt;ref name="inahvol"/&gt;&lt;ref name="vuelan"/&gt;&lt;ref name="jhernandez"&gt;{{Cite news|title= Crean escuela de 'niños voladores' |first=Julian |last=Hernandez |newspaper=Reforma |location=Mexico City |date=2009-04-19 |page=15 |language=Spanish |trans-title=Schoold created for "Volador Children" }}&lt;/ref&gt; To become a volador in the traditional Totonac community requires 10 to 12 years ofpreparation and many consider it to be a life vocation.&lt;ref name="jhernandez"/&gt;

Another effort to conserve and promote the tradition is the Encuentro de Voladores (Volador Encounter), which was begun in 2009 and coincides with the Cumbre Tajín spring equinox event of the El Tajín site. For five days, voladores from various places perform at the poles erected at the site. The objective is not only to see the different costumes and styles of the groups but to share experiences about the fertility ritual. Voladores come from as far as [[San Luis Potosí]] and [[Guatemala]].&lt;ref name="rreyes"&gt;{{Cite news|title= Tajín, un espacio para vivir la magia |first= Regina |last= Reyes-Heroles C |url= http://www.cnnexpansion.com/viajes/2009/02/23/tajin-un-espacio-para-vivir-la-magia |newspaper=CNN Expansion |date= 2009-02-25 |accessdate=2010-02-09 |language=Spanish |trans-title=Tajin, a space to experience the magic }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="cguerrero"&gt;{{Cite news|title= Bienvenida al equinoccio: Tajin |first=Carla |last=Guerrero |newspaper=Reforma  |location=Mexico City |date=2004-03-14 |page=11 |language=Spanish |trans-title=Welcome to the equinox: Tajin}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One reason for the need of protection is that in most cases in Mexico, the ritual is not performed for religious purposes.&lt;ref name="wilkerson75"/&gt;  The first organization for voladores came about in the 1970s but also the commercialization of the ritual.&lt;ref name="inahvol"/&gt; There are about 600 professional voladores in Mexico.&lt;ref name="salvaguardar"&gt;{{cite press release |title= Instaurarán consejo para salvaguardar el ritual de los Voladores de Papantla |publisher= [[CONACULTA]]|date=2009-10-09 |url= http://www.conaculta.gob.mx/sala_prensa_detalle.php?id=2207 |language=Spanish |trans-title=Creating a council to safeguard the ritual of the Voladores of Papantla |accessdate=2010-02-11 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In smaller communities, the ritual is enacted only on the feast day of the community’s patron saint or other religious events, but in larger communities, especially where there are tourists, it is performed as an attraction for donations.&lt;ref name="arteshistoria"/&gt; Two examples of this are the voladores that perform in Xcaret and Xel-Ha,&lt;ref name="xcaret"&gt;{{Cite news|title= Xcaret y Xel-Ha: 'Pequena caleta', diversion grande |newspaper=El Norte  |location=Monterrey, Mexico |date=2005-05-22 |page=10 |language=Spanish |trans-title=Xcaret and Xel Ha:Little Heat, Big Fun}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the Totonac voladores in Chapultepec Park in Mexico City, who are one of the parks major attractions.&lt;ref name="eneldf"&gt;{{Cite news|title= Una tradicion de Veracruz en el DF |newspaper=Reforma  |location=Mexico City |date=2006-01-08 |page=5 |language=Spanish |trans-title=A Veracruz tradition in the Distrito Federal}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some groups of voladores try to balance respect for the ritual while still performing for spectators. There is a formal established group in [[Boca del Río, Veracruz|Boca del Río]] that has been recognized by municipal authorities and receives support in the way of space and a permanent pole.. The goal of the group is to offer to tourists a dignified version of the ritual at the Plaza Bandera that does not forget its roots. Members of the group are all natives of the city of Papantla.

'''Domus de Janas''' ([[Sardinian language|Sardinian]]: "House of the Fairies" or of the "Witches") are a type of [[pre-Nuragic Sardinia|pre-Nuragic]] [[chamber tomb]]s found in [[Sardinia]]. They consist of several chambers quarried out by the people of the [[San Ciriaco culture|San Ciriaco]] through [[Ozieri culture]]s&lt;ref name=Portale1&gt;[http://www.ilportalesardo.it/archeo/percorsi/janas.htm ''Domus de Janas'', Portale Sardo] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304061240/http://www.ilportalesardo.it/archeo/percorsi/janas.htm |date=March 4, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and subsequent cultures, resembling houses in their layout.
[[File:Porto Torres - Su Crucifissu Mannu (2).JPG|thumb|Bull's horns, [[necropolis of Su Crucifissu Mannu]], [[Porto Torres]]]]
Built mostly between 3400 and 2700 BC, they date to the late [[Neolithic]], [[Chalcolithic]] and early [[Bronze Age]]. A necropolis of them at the site of [[Necropolis of Anghelu Ruju|Anghelu Ruju]], near [[Alghero]], consists of 38 tombs. Other large sites are those of ''[[Necropolis of Montessu|Montessu]]'', near [[Villaperuccio]], and of ''[[Necropolis of Sant'Andrea Priu|Sant'Andrea Priu]]'' at [[Bonorva]]. Many other domus de janas can be found throughout the island, with the excpetion of [[Gallura]] (where the deceased were usually buried in [[megalithic]] circles, such as that those of [[necropolis of Li Muri|Li Muri]]).

The shape of the internal chambers can vary from that of a rounded hut with conical or triangular ceiling. The walls are often decorated with reliefs or etchings depicting magical and religious symbols such as [[spiral]]s, [[zig-zag]] motifs and [[bull]]'s [[Horn (anatomy)|horns]].&lt;ref name=Portale2&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ilportalesardo.it/archeo/percorsi/janas.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-07-16 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304061240/http://www.ilportalesardo.it/archeo/percorsi/janas.htm |archivedate=2016-03-04 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The corpses, painted with red [[ochre]] like the tomb's walls, were buried together with common life objects, jewels and tools. According to archaeologist [[Giovanni Lilliu]], they were buried under shells of [[mollusc]]s; according to other theories, they were left outside the tomb, being put inside only after they had reduced to a skeleton.

'''Entertainment-Education''' is a communication strategy that aims to alleviate a social issue or educate the public through a custom-tailored piece of entertainment. It is defined by a set of techniques and methodologies which all aim to use various levels of mass media to communicate social and behavior change.

In 1950, the UK-based radio soap opera [[The Archers]] broke ground by being specifically designed to educate the British people about farming issues and to help increase productivity in the [[Postwar|postwar era]] of [[Rationing in the United Kingdom|rationing]] and food shortages.&lt;ref&gt;Donovan, Paul (1991), ''The Radio Companion''. London: Grafton; p. 8.&lt;/ref&gt; It is the longest-running Soap Opera in the world, and is still broadcast today with millions of listeners.

[[Miguel Sabido]], a Mexican TV producer, further formalized the field.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.populationmedia.org/product/sabido-history/|title=History of the Sabido Methodology - Population Media Center|website=Population Media Center|language=en-US|access-date=2018-04-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; He initially called it "Entertainment with a proven social benefit" in the 1960s, which [[Everett Rogers]] re-branded as "Entertainment and Education" in 1979, and [[Patrick Coleman]] simplified as "Entertainment-Education", which is the presently used term. 

While the field has evolved in the last 50 years, it is still strongly based on Sabido's specific approach. Nowadays, many practitioners in Entertainment-Education come from a background of [[public health]], [[health communication]] and [[behavior change communication]]. 

Sabido pioneered his method in 1967 by leveraging the Mexican tabloid ''[[Casos de Alarma]]'' to encourage readers to join the social security system of Mexico. The release of the Peruvian telenovela [[Simplemente María (1969 TV series)|''Simplemente María'' (1969)]] validated his assumptions about using mass media for social change, as the sale of sewing machines increased dramatically after the telenovela aired.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=A|first=Singhal|last2=EM|first2=Rogers|last3=R|first3=Obregon|date=1994|title=Simplemente Maria and formation of the entertainment-education strategy.|url=https://www.popline.org/node/309874|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sabido went on to produce ''[[Ven conmigo (TV series)|Ven conmigo]]'', which was widely successful with a 32 point share and resulted in a million people enrolling in the adult education system of Mexico after the series' 1-year runtime.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1987-09-20/news/mn-8914_1_soap-operas|title=Adult Literacy, Birth Control Addressed in Dramas :  Third World Soaps Tackle Social Problems|last=CRIDER|first=JEFF|date=1987-09-20|work=Los Angeles Times|access-date=2018-04-19|language=en-US|issn=0458-3035}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.co.id/books?id=USS5AwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA227&amp;lpg=PA227&amp;dq=ven+conmigo+adult+education+mexico&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=dcWPFAKIGt&amp;sig=kDB5gPLVIcmBcVZRCaOPhz4dVgA&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjuhYmA0MXaAhVEwI8KHQfcDxoQ6AEIODAD#v=onepage&amp;q=ven%20conmigo%20adult%20education%20mexico&amp;f=false|title=Created to Learn: A Christian Teacher's Introduction to Educational Psychology, Second Edition|last=Yount|first=William|date=2010-08-15|publisher=B&amp;H Publishing Group|isbn=9781433672811|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The Sabido-produced, [[family planning]]-themed telenovelas ''[[Acompáñame (TV series)|Acompáñame]]'', ''[[Vamos juntos]]'', ''[[caminemos]]'' and ''[[Nosotros los Mujeres]]'' followed soon after in the 1970s, which collectively resulted in a 34 percent decline of the population growth rate of Mexico.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.populationmedia.org/product/sabido-history/|title=History of the Sabido Methodology - Population Media Center|website=Population Media Center|language=en-US|access-date=2018-04-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[United Nations]] awarded Mexico with their Population Prize after that run; [[United States Agency for International Development]]'s Thomas Donnelly wrote: "''The Televisa family planning soap operas have made the single most powerful contribution to the Mexican population success story.''"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.populationinstitute.org/newsroom/press/view/69/|title=The Population Institute|website=www.populationinstitute.org|language=en|access-date=2018-04-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[David Poindexter]] of [[PCI Media Impact|Population Communications International]] saw great promise in this approach, and introduced him to US-American psychologist [[Albert Bandura]]. Bandura was able to explain some of Sabido's enormous impact through his [[social learning theory]] and later went on to publish many papers on the effects of [[Serial drama|serial (radio and television)]] dramas.

In a series of strategic meetings in the 1970s and 80s, Poindexter invited Sabido to teach his method world-wide in India, China, the Philippines, Egypt, and the Netherlands. Together with [[Sonny Fox]], the president of the [[National Academy of Television Arts and Sciences]], they then organized so-called "Soap Summits" that brought together the CEOs of large American broadcasters, as well as introduce American TV writers to the methods of Entertainment-Education.[[File:SBCC Summit 2018 Crowd in Nusa Dua, Indonesia.jpg|thumb|Over 1,200 attendees came to the 2018 SBCC Summit, where Entertainment-Education was a main topic among [[Social and Behavior Change Communication]] professionals.]]
Since the early days in the 1980s, a number of organizations have flourished, led by Poindexter-heritage non-profits [[PCI Media]] and [[Population Media Center]] on the actively producing side, jointly having made 140 shows that reached more than 2 Billion people&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.populationmedia.org/our-approach/impact/|title=PMC Impact - Population Media Center|work=Population Media Center|access-date=2018-04-19|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://mediaimpact.org/who-we-are/|title=Who We Are|date=2012-10-23|work=PCI Media Impact|access-date=2018-04-19|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; and had enormous impact on [[prevention of HIV/AIDS]], [[family planning]] and [[women's rights]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.populationmedia.org/our-approach/impact/|title=PMC Impact - Population Media Center|work=Population Media Center|access-date=2018-04-19|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://mediaimpact.org/what-we-do/|title=What We Do|date=2012-10-23|work=PCI Media Impact|access-date=2018-04-19|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In an effort to systematize health communications in Hollywood content, the [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]] teamed up with [[USC Annenberg School for Communication and Journalism]], jointly creating [[Hollywood, Health and Society]]. HH&amp;S advises [[Writers Guild of America West]] writers in the inclusion of health-related topics in mainstream television and film.

'''Erwin Faber''' (21 July 1891 &amp;ndash; 4 May 1989) was a leading actor in [[Munich]] and later throughout [[Germany]], beginning after [[World War I]], and through the late-1970s, when he was still performing at the [[Residenz Theatre]] (The National Theatre of Bavaria).  Born in [[Innsbruck]], [[Austria]], Faber remained in Germany during the [[Third Reich]], emerging afterwards as a prominent actor in the Federal Republic of Germany (West Germany).  He died in Munich in 1989, only two months after his last performance at the Residenztheater (the National Theatre of Bavaria), at age 97.

== Acting career ==
In addition to performing in dozens of dramas and films in Germany, working with the leading directors in post-World War I Germany, such as [[Max Reinhardt]], [[Otto Falckenberg]], and [[Erich Engel]], Faber also was chosen by [[Bertolt Brecht]] to play the leads in the first three staged plays of Brecht in Munich, beginning with ''[[Drums in the Night]]'' (''Trommeln in der Nacht'') at the avant-garde theatre, the Munich Kammerspiele in September 1922, followed by ''[[In The Jungle of Cities]]'' (''Im Dickicht der Städte'') at Munich's Residenz Theater in May 1923, and ''[[The Life of Edward II of England]]'' (''Leben Eduards des Zweiten von England'') directed by Brecht himself in his directing debut and featuring [[Oskar Homolka]], in March 1924.&lt;ref name="actingbrecht"&gt;"Acting Brecht: The Munich Years," by W. Stuart McDowell, in ''The Brecht Sourcebook'', Carol Martin, Henry Bial, editors (Routledge, 2000) p. 71&amp;ndash;83.&lt;/ref&gt;
  
Erwin Faber also played the lead in a film written by Brecht in 1923, ''[[Mysteries of a Barbershop]]'' (''Mysterien eines Friseursalons''), with leading comic and dramatic actors of Germany of that time: [[Karl Valentin]], Liesl Karlstadt, Blandine Ebinger, [[Max Schreck]], and Carola Neher.  The 16-minute improvised film is now considered one of the hundred most important films in history of [[German film]].&lt;ref name="actingbrecht" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Historical Journal of Film, Radio and Television'',  by David Culbert, (Louisiana State University, Carfax Publishing) March, 1995.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="brechtvalentin"&gt;"A Brecht-Valentin Production: ''Mysteries of a Barbershop''", W. Stuart McDowell, ''Performing Arts Journal'', Vol. 1, No. 3 (Winter, 1977), pp. 2&amp;ndash;14.&lt;/ref&gt;

Erwin Faber also was cast by [[Ingmar Bergman]] for his film ''Life of the Marionettes'' in 1980.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title = Ingmar Bergman, Master Filmmaker, Dies at 89 | url = https://www.nytimes.com/2007/07/30/movies/30cnd-bergman.html | first = Mervyn | last = Rothstein | publisher = New York Times | date = 2007-07-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Classic baby shoes.jpg|thumb|right|A 6-word story regarding a pair of baby shoes is considered an extreme example of [[flash fiction]].]]
'''"For sale: baby shoes, never worn."''' is the entirety of what has been described as a six-word story, making it an extreme example of what is called [[flash fiction]] or sudden fiction. Although it is often attributed to [[Ernest Hemingway]], the link to him is unsubstantiated and similar stories predate him.&lt;ref name="quote"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://quoteinvestigator.com/2013/01/28/baby-shoes/|author=Garson O’Toole|title=For Sale, Baby Shoes, Never Worn|publisher=quoteinvestigator.com|date=January 28, 2013|accessdate=19 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Haglund"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.slate.com/blogs/browbeat/2013/01/31/for_sale_baby_shoes_never_worn_hemingway_probably_did_not_write_the_famous.html|title=Did Hemingway Really Write His Famous Six-Word Story?|last=Haglund|first=David|date= Jan 31, 2013|publisher=Slate|accessdate=14 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Setting ==
The claim of Hemingway's authorship originates in an unsubstantiated anecdote about a wager between him and other writers. In a 1992 letter to Canadian humorist [[John Robert Colombo]], science fiction writer [[Arthur C. Clarke]] recounts it thus: While lunching with friends at a restaurant (variously identified as [[Luchow's]] or [[Algonquin Hotel|The Algonquin]]), Hemingway bets the table ten dollars each that he can craft an entire story in six words. After the pot is assembled, Hemingway writes "For sale: baby shoes, never worn" on a napkin, passes this around the table, and collects his winnings.&lt;ref name="quote" /&gt;

== History ==
[[File:Babys Clothes Never Worn.png|thumb|300px|right|This May 16, 1910 article from ''The Spokane Press'' recounts an earlier advertisement which struck the author as particularly tragic.]]
The May 16, 1910, edition of ''The Spokane Press'' had an article titled "Tragedy of Baby's Death is Revealed in Sale of Clothes." At that time, Hemingway would only have been aged ten, and years away from beginning his writing career.&lt;ref name="quote" /&gt;

In 1917, William R. Kane published a piece in a periodical called ''The Editor'' where he outlined the basic idea of a grief-stricken woman who had lost her baby and even suggested the title of ''Little Shoes, Never Worn''.&lt;ref name="Haglund" /&gt; In his version of the story, the shoes are being given away rather than sold. He suggests that this would provide some measure of solace for the seller, as it would mean that another baby would at least benefit directly.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=rF04AQAAIAAJ&amp;q=%22never+worn%22&amp;redir_esc=y#v=snippet&amp;|title=untitled|last=Kane|first=William R.|date=February 24, 1917|work=The Editor: The Journal of Information for Literary Workers, Volume 45, number 4|pages=175–176|accessdate=20 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By 1921, the story was already being parodied: the July issue of ''[[Judge (magazine)|Judge]]'' that year published a version that used a [[baby carriage]] instead of shoes; there, however, the narrator described contacting the seller to offer condolences, only to be told that the sale was due to the birth of twins rather than of a single child.&lt;ref name="quote" /&gt;

The earliest known connection to Hemingway was in 1991, thirty years after the author’s death.&lt;ref name="quote" /&gt; This attribution was in a book by Peter Miller called ''Get Published! Get Produced!: A Literary Agent’s Tips on How to Sell Your Writing''. He said he was told the story by a "well-established newspaper syndicator" in 1974.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Miller|first=Peter|title=Get Published! Get Produced!: A Literary Agent’s Tips on How to Sell Your Writing|publisher=SP Books|date=Mar 1, 1991|pages=27|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=VqKAE2euEnMC&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;dq=Get%20Published!%20Get%20Produced!%3A%20A%20Literary%20Agent%E2%80%99s%20Tips%20on%20How%20to%20Sell%20Your%20Writing&amp;pg=PA27#v=onepage&amp;q=baby&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1992, John Robert Colombo printed a letter from Arthur C. Clarke that repeated the story, complete with Hemingway having won $10 each from fellow writers.&lt;ref name="quote" /&gt;

This connection to Hemingway was reinforced by a one-man play called ''Papa'' by John deGroot, which debuted in 1996. Set during a ''[[Life (magazine)|Life]]'' magazine photo session in 1959, deGroot has the character utter the phrase as a means of illustrating Hemingway’s brevity.&lt;ref name="quote" /&gt; In ''[[Playbill]]'', deGroot defended his portrayal of Hemingway by saying, "Everything in the play is based on events as described by Ernest Hemingway, or those who knew him well. Whether or not these things actually happened is something we’ll never know truly. But Hemingway and many others claimed they did."&lt;ref name="snopes"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.snopes.com/language/literary/babyshoes.asp|title=Baby Shoes|last1=Mikkelson |first1=David |last2=Mikkelson |first2=Barbara|date=29 October 2008|website=[[Snopes.com]] |accessdate=14 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Legacy ==
The general concept of trying to tell a story with the absolute minimum of words became known by the general term of [[flash fiction]]. The six-word limit in particular has spawned the concept of [[Six-Word Memoirs]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cbsnews.com/2100-500186_162-3876944.html|title=Six-Word Memoirs Can Say It All|date=February 11, 2009|publisher=CBS News|accessdate=20 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; including a collection published in book form in 2008 by ''[[Smith Magazine]]'', and two sequels published in 2009.

There have also been theater adaptations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=http://dctheatrescene.com/2008/09/24/harold-and-the-purple-crayon/ |title=Harold and the Purple Crayon |publisher=DC Theatre Scene |date=2008-09-24 |accessdate=2015-10-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bsoinc.com/family/artist.php?artist=harold] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090213004752/http://www.bsoinc.com/family/artist.php?artist=harold|date=February 13, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[couch gag]] for the ''[[The Simpsons|Simpsons]]'' episode "[[The Bob Next Door]]", Harold is shown drawing the Simpson family living room during the regular title sequence. Homer also asks Harold to draw him a can of beer after he finishes with the living room.

In 2011, the story was adapted as an interactive book for the [[iPad]] by [[Trilogy Studios]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/harold-and-the-purple-crayon/id450829541?mt=8 |title=iTunes Store |publisher=itunes.apple.com |date= |accessdate=2015-10-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Film===
In February 2010, it was reported that [[Sony Pictures Animation]] and [[Will Smith]]'s [[Overbrook Entertainment]] are developing a CGI-animated film adaptation of ''Harold and the Purple Crayon''. It is being produced by Smith and [[James Lassiter]], and written by Josh Klausner.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Rowles|first=Dustin|title=Exclusive: Harold and the Purple Crayon Headed to the Big Screen|url=http://www.pajiba.com/trade_news/harold-and-the-purple-crayon-heading-to-the-big-screen.php|accessdate=August 13, 2011|newspaper=Pajiba|date=February 25, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; In December 2016, it had been reported that the film will also be written by [[Dallas Clayton]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://mobile.twitter.com/MyTrackingBoard/status/806410462137110528?p=v|title=Twitter |date=December 7, 2016|accessdate=December 7, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the protagonists in ''[[Captain Underpants]],'' Harold Hutchins, is named after the protagonist in the book, along with George Beard being named after the protagonist in ''[[Curious George]].''

In Rob Reiner's 1999 romantic comedy ''[[The Story of Us (film)|The Story of Us]]'', Kate (Michelle Pfeiffer) says that ''Harold and the Purple Crayon'' is one of her favorite books and an allegory for her marriage with Ben (Bruce Willis). She later explains that Ben just wouldn't "share the crayon," and that she feels she has been living in ''his'' world rather than one she had helped create.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1649">'''Inevitable disclosure''' is a [[legal doctrine]] through which an employer can claim [[trade secret]] to [[enjoin]] a former employee from working in a job that may result in the use of trade secrets without the need for proof or evidence.  

The inevitable-disclosure doctrine is one's means in demonstrating a revelation of trade secrets, and some have recently found some renewed judicial support. Where it is acceptable, the doctrine allows the court to find that a former employee would disclose proprietary information in their position with a new employer, even if there is no evidence of actual disclosure. Thus, allowing a company to make a critical showing, when it can't do so if required to come forward with evidence of misconduct. However, because it also rests on a prediction about a future harm, inevitable disclosure also is in tension with the general principle that injunctive relief will not be given to prevent a conjectural injury at any means.

*Only those magazines that are ''exclusively'' published '''online''' are identified as such.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="115496">{{DISPLAYTITLE:List of music biographies in Rees's ''Cyclopaedia''}}
The music articles in [[Rees's Cyclopaedia|Rees's ''Cyclopaedia'']] were written by [[Charles Burney]] (1726–1814), with additional material by [[John Farey, sr]] (1766–1826), and [[John Farey, Jr]] (1791–1851), and illustrated by 53 plates as well a numerous examples of music typset within the articles.

Charles Burney was well known as the author of a ''General History of Music'', 4 vol 1776–1789 and two travel diaries recording his Musical Tours collecting information in France and Italy, and later Germany, 1+2 vol, 1771 and 1773, as well as the ''Commemoration of Handel'', 1785 and his ''Musical Memoirs of Metastasio'', 1796. John Farey, sr was a polymath, well known today for his work as a geologist and for his investigations of the mathematics of sound, and the schemes of temperamant used in tuning musical instruments then. His son, John Farey, jr, was also polymathic in his interests. He contributed numerous drawings for the illustrations of mostly technological and scientific topics in Rees's Cyclopaedia.

Burney's music biographies range from antiquity to the first decade of the nineteenth century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Lipking|first1=Lawrence|title=The Ordering of the Arts in Eighteenth-Century England|date=1970|publisher=Princeton University Press|pages=318–319|accessdate=21 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; He wrote 756 articles, and while great number of the names, such as Mozart,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Oldman|first1=C. B.|title=Dr Burney and Mozart|journal=Mozart Jahrbuch|date=1964|volume=1962/63|pages=75–81}}&lt;/ref&gt; were featured in his earlier writings,  others are unique to the ''Cyclopaedia''. These mainly concern minor London musicians and singers, whom Burney had known personally in his young days. Some are known through modern reference books, but others, often with only surname, only have their memory recorded in the pages of the ''Cyclopaedia''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Lonsdale|first1=Roger|title=Dr Charles Burney|date=1965|publisher=Oxford: The Clarendon Press|page=412|accessdate=17 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a few cases Burney has anglicised Christian names — John Frederick Reichardt, instead of Johann Friedrich, for example.&lt;ref&gt;Rees's Cyclopaedia, vol 29&lt;/ref&gt;

In his biographies Burney mirrored the ''Lives of the Poets'' by Samuel Johnson, namely: a short summary of the subject's reputation, with a summary of his career, a list of his works and an account of his genius and his contribution to music.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Mackerness|first1=E. D.|title=Dr Burney, Biographer|journal=Contemporary Review|date=1956|volume=CLXXXIX [189]|pages=352–357}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Lonsdale has commented that a handful of Burney biographical articles are misplaced in the alphabetical sequence.&lt;ref&gt;Lonsdale, Roger, 'Dr Burney's 'Dictionary of Music' ',''Musicology Australia'', vol. 5, no. 1, p.&amp;nbsp; 162, 1979&lt;/ref&gt; These occur mostly under the letter A, and were missed in the early stages of writing, when Burney was trying to overtake the press, for he did not start composing the texts until the summer of 1801, when the work was already underway. One, [[Jacques Arcadelt|Jacques Arkadelt]] in Vol 2, appears twice, as Giacomo Arkadelt in Vol, 16 where he is listed in the middle of the Gs, but with a shorter article.

'''ALPHABETISATION OF ARTICLES'''

The work followed the common practice of conflating the letters I and J and U and V into single sequences. The topics included in this list therefore follow the sequence they appear in the original volumes.

'''ANNOTATION'''

The articles are annotated to [[Frank Mercer (writer on music)|Mercer]]'s edition of Burney's ''History'' (1935) and [[Percy Scholes|Scholes]]'s edition of Burney's ''Travels'' (1959). Where a page reference is given the text can be found there. Where a book is cited, but with no page, index entries were found, and Burney is presumed to have written his article using the information there. Where there is no annotation, the article must be unique to the ''Cyclopaedia''

'''Miller Richardson''' (1917 &amp;ndash; May 25, 2012) was an American visual artist, stage and costume designer, scenographer and modern dance choreographer best known for his collaborations with [[Flower Hujer]] in the Flower Hujer Dance Theater company.

==Life and career==

William Miller Richardson, known professionally as Miller Richardson, was born  in El Paso, Texas.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.silive.com/obituaries/index.ssf/2012/08/william_miller_richardson_95.html | Obituary&lt;/ref&gt;  He studied architecture at the [[Georgia Institute of Technology]]. At 19 he was awarded a scholarship to study art at the [[Art Students League]] under [[William Charles McNulty]]. He also studied at the [[Museum of Design Atlanta]] during 1938.

In 1953 he met choreographer and dancer [[Flower Hujer]], who is described in his obituary as his "longtime companion".&lt;ref&gt;http://www.luckyrabbitestatesales.com/apps/blog/show/26940257-the-antique-estate-sale-of-the-decade-&lt;/ref&gt; In 1975 they bought a neo-Gothic house together in New Brighton, Pendleton Place, which he restored. According to the New York Times: "His garden is exquisite, with shaped fir trees that give it an Italian air."&lt;ref&gt;https://www.nytimes.com/1997/12/21/realestate/streetscapes-pendleton-place-3-houses-that-recall-19th-century-staten-island.html&lt;/ref&gt; They lived there the rest of their lives. He collaborated with Hujer as artistic director of the Flower Hujer Dance Theatre, where he worked on choreography, costume and lighting design and sometimes performed. Richardson and Hujer were known for their exotic costumes and creative choreography. In 1984 he did a demonstration of costume design at [[Lincoln Center]].&lt;ref&gt;Dance, New York Magazine, October 29, p. 113&lt;/ref&gt; Their dances, based on religious and nature themes and praised for their dignity and simplicity, were presented in [[Trinity Wall Street]], [[St. Bartholomew's Episcopal Church (Manhattan)|St. Bartholomew's]],&lt;ref&gt;Dance, New York Magazine, December 5, 1988, p. 344&lt;/ref&gt; [[Church of the Intercession (Manhattan)]], Choreospace and other venues. Their best known piece was "[[Le Jongleur de Notre Dame|The Juggler of Our Lady]]", based on a medieval legend turned into a story by [[Anatole France]]. It was broadcast on television in 1965, performed in Kennebunk, Maine, in 1967,&lt;ref&gt;https://newspaperarchive.com/us/maine/biddeford/biddeford-journal/1967/08-14/page-2| Interfaith Service Ends Arts Festival, Biddeford Journal: Monday, August 14, 1967 - Page 2&lt;/ref&gt; and had revivals in 1981, 1988 and 1990.

Richardson worked as a multi-media artist. In addition to working in the theater, painting settings, backdrops and decor, he also executed commissions like portraits, murals, and decorative projects. He did not retire until he was nearly 90.

They are basically scrolls of narratives from mythology and folklore. They are used in [[storytelling]].

==History==
The art is believed to be brought to [[India]] by [[Mughal Emperors]] who brought [[Usta, Iran|Usta]] artists.

==Art form==
Nakashi art usually contain bright hues (most primary colors) with a predominance of red in the background. They are easy to relate to - as the themes and stories are familiar - drawn from the storehouse of ancient literary and folk traditions. 

Nakashi scrolls and dolls were originally used for story telling. These days, they are being used to adorn the walls in homes.

[[Cherial scroll painting]]s are highly stylised version on this art.

A '''Nativity play''' or '''Christmas pageant''' is a [[Play (theatre)|play]] which recounts the story of the [[Nativity of Jesus]].   It is usually performed at [[Christmas]], the [[Calendar of saints|feast]] of the Nativity.

==Liturgical==
The term "Nativity Drama" is used by Wellesz&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite journal |last=Wellesz |first=Egon |title=The Nativity Drama of the Byzantine Church |journal=Journal of Roman Studies |volume=37 |year=1947 |pages=145–151 |doi=10.2307/298465 |publisher=Society for the Promotion of Roman Studies |jstor=298465}}
&lt;/ref&gt; in his discussion of the ''[[troparion]]'' [[hymn]]s in the Christmas [[liturgy]] of [[Byzantine Rite]] Churches, from [[Sophronius of Jerusalem|Sophronius]] in the seventh century.  Goldstein argues&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite book |title=The Origin of Medieval Drama |first=Leonard |last=Goldstein |year=2004 |publisher=[[Fairleigh Dickinson University]]  Press |isbn=0-8386-4004-4 |location= |pages=54–60}}
&lt;/ref&gt; that the label "drama" is misleading, that the ''troparia'' are more akin to an [[oratorio]] than a play, and that the form is not a precursor of later more decidedly dramatic forms.

Saint [[Francis of Assisi]] performed [[Midnight Mass]] in [[Greccio]] on Christmas Eve 1223 in front of a life-size [[nativity scene]] (crib or creche) built by Giovanni Velita, with live animals.  This is sometimes credited as the first nativity play. However, more formal Nativity plays have featured in [[Christian worship]] since medieval [[mystery play]]s.  The twelfth to nineteenth pageants of the 48-play [[York Mystery Cycle]] dealt with the Nativity story.  In [[Germany]], the [[Weihnachten]] services on [[Christmas Eve]] include a children's [[Mass (liturgy)|mass]] called ''Weihnachtsgeschichte'', which features a ''Krippenspiel'' ("crib play").

==Popular==
In [[Latin America]] ''pastorelas'' ("shepherd's plays") are performed in many local communities.  These were imported during [[Spanish colonization of the Americas]] but are no longer common in [[Spain]].  They recount the story of the [[adoration of the shepherds|shepherds travelling to worship the newborn Christ]] , augmenting the Biblical text with [[apocrypha]]l events, [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|indigenous]] beliefs, regional features, [[anachronism]]s, [[satire]] and [[buffoonery]].  Each community's play evolves into a distinctive tradition.&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Belgium]], [[puppet theatre]]s often put on variations on the Nativity play in the weeks before Christmas, with parents and their children in the audience.  The play often depicts the [[Massacre of the Innocents]] which occurred after the birth of Jesus.&lt;ref name="belg"&gt;
{{cite journal |issn=1481-4374 |journal=Comparative Literature and Culture: A WWWeb Journal |title=Symbolism, Popular Drama, and Politics and Art in Belgium, 1886-1910 |issue=5.3 Comparative Cultural Studies and Popular Culture |editor=Benton Jay Komins |url=http://clcwebjournal.lib.purdue.edu/clcweb03-3/gross03.html |first=Joan |last=Gross  |date=September 2003 |volume=5 |accessdate=2008-02-18 |publisher=[[Purdue University Press]] }}
&lt;/ref&gt;  Joan Gross traces this augmentation back to cryptic protests in the late nineteenth century against the abuse of native peoples by colonists in the [[Leopold II of Belgium|King Leopold II]]'s [[Congo Free State]].&lt;ref name="belg"/&gt;

In [[Townsville]], [[Queensland]] Australia, the [[Stable on the Strand]] is an annual nativity play held at the city's oceanfront park.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.abc.net.au/local/videos/2010/12/23/3100559.htm|title=Journey into Bethlehem|last=Fernbach|first=Nathalie|date=23 December 2010|newspaper=ABC (Australia)|accessdate=3 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/2015-12-22/stable-on-strand-first-baby-still-involved-event/7047752|title=Very first Stable on The Strand baby still supports Townsville event 17 years on|last=Fernbach|first=Nathalie|date=22 December 2015|work=[[Australian Broadcasting Corporation]]|access-date=10 October 2018|last2=Calderwood|first2=Kathleen}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In schools==
[[File:Childrens Nativity Play 2007.jpg|thumb|A children's nativity play.]]
Many, especially [[Christian school|Christian-oriented]], [[primary school]]s and [[Sunday School]]s put on a Nativity play before the [[Christmas break]] begins. Children in costume act as the human and [[angel]] characters, and often as the animals and props. The infant Jesus is sometimes represented by a [[doll]], but sometimes played by a real baby. [[Parent]]s, grandparents, stepparents and siblings, schoolteachers and sometimes the church community in general form the audience. The tradition of Nativity plays in [[United Kingdom|British]] [[State school|state]] [[primary school#United Kingdom|primary school]]s is declining in favour of secular plays, because of the need to include pupils of other faiths. However, a survey in 2012 found that 20% of schools were planning a traditional Nativity play and a further 50% were intending to stage an updated version of the Christmas story, sometimes with new music and extra characters.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/1571187/School-nativity-plays-under-threat.html The Daily Telegraph - 17 December 2012 - ''School nativity plays under threat'']&lt;/ref&gt;

==Literary==
{{Main|Nativity of Jesus in later culture}}
Modern writers to have written Nativity plays include [[Laurence Housman]] (''Bethlehem'', 1902; musical accompaniment by [[Joseph Moorat]] c.1919&lt;ref&gt;

{{The Works of Aristotle}}
'''''On Colors''''' (Greek Περὶ χρωμάτων; Latin ''De Coloribus'') is a treatise attributed to [[Aristotle]]&lt;ref&gt;Barnes, Jonathan (1984).  ''The Complete Works of Aristotle'' (2 Vols.), Princeton University Press, pp. 1219-1228 (V 1).  {{ISBN|0-691-01650-X}}.&lt;/ref&gt; but sometimes ascribed to [[Theophrastus]] or [[Strato of Lampsacus|Strato]]. The work outlines the theory that all [[colors]] (yellow, red, purple, green, and blue) are derived from mixtures of black and white. ''On colors'' had a pronounced impact on subsequent [[Color Theory|color theories]] and remained influential until [[Isaac Newton]]'s experiments with light refraction.

The '''Oslo City Art Award''' (''Oslo bys kunstnerpris'') is given annually for contributions to the arts by the city of [[Oslo, Norway]].

The Oslo City Art Award has been awarded every year since 1978 with the exception of 1991 when the prize was not awarded due to a lack of funding. Since inception, the prize has been distributed to 4-5 recipients annually. The prize is "awarded to individuals who in the past or in recent years has made an outstanding achievement in Oslo's art world".  The prize consists of a diploma and a monetary amount. The award is most often made simultaneously with the presentation of the [[Oslo City Culture Award]], which consists of a bronze medal and a monetary amount.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.oslo.kommune.no/kultur-og-utdanningskomiteen/oslo-bys-kulturpris-og-kunstnerpriser-article17620-4233.html ''Oslo bys kulturpris og kunstnerpriser'' (Oslo commune)]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;

'''Rita Genet''' is an [[United States|American]]-born artist who has lived and worked in [[Jamaica]] for 20 years.

==Early life==
Born in Rhode Island and raised in [[Milford, Connecticut]], Genet studied art at the [[University of Connecticut]] in Storrs, and the School of Visual Arts in New York City, where she earned a Bachelor of Fine Arts degree in painting, and was a member of the Board of Directors of the Alumni Society. In 1972, as a young textile designer in New York City, Genet traveled to Jamaica on holiday.&lt;ref&gt;Caribbean Today, [http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P1-2361472.html "Rita Genet: From Rhode Island to Ocho Rios"], 08-31-1995&lt;/ref&gt; It was there that she became inspired by what she saw, and began painting her decidedly Caribbean style. Eventually, she quit her job in New York City, and moved to [[Ocho Rios|Ocho Rios, Jamaica]], where she could focus on her painting.

==Painting career==
Genet's portrayals of tropical colors, angels, trees, and decidedly Caribbean style have drawn a demand for her work in international galleries and with private collectors.{{citation needed|date=May 2013}} With a style called "sophisticated-naivety",{{citation needed|date=May 2013}} her vision of tropical scenes is expressed through a kaleidoscope of colors.

During her 20 years of painting in Jamaica, Genet's listings in group exhibitions included Harmony Hall, Round Hill Charity Shows, Tryall, [[National Gallery of Jamaica|The National Gallery]], and The Bay Gallery, Montego Bay.  Her work has been included in a showing of Jamaican artists in Berlin and in the Galerie Pro Arte Kasper, Lausanne, Switzerland in the International Competition for 25 countries. She has shown in New York, New Jersey, U.S. Virgin Islands and has paintings in many corporate collections in both the United States and abroad.&lt;ref&gt;The Sunday Gleaner, Outlook Magazine, "In a Woman's World: Inspired by Jamaica", Sunday, April 30, 1995&lt;/ref&gt; Ms. Genet's work was featured on the cover of the Nov/Dec 1995 issue of SkyWritings (Air Jamaica's In-Flight Magazine).

While in Jamaica, Genet was invited to do Christmas cards for United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF), The Jamaica Association for the Deaf.,&lt;ref&gt;The Gleaner, "Genet Cards for UNICEF", Tuesday, December 21, 1993&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Jamaica Journal, Institute of Jamaica, 1993, Vol.25-26, Pg.62, [http://www.google.com/search?q=%22rita%20Genet%22&amp;oe=utf-8&amp;rls=org.mozilla:en-US:official&amp;client=firefox-a&amp;um=1&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;tbo=u&amp;tbs=bks:1&amp;source=og&amp;sa=N&amp;hl=en&amp;tab=wp see Google Books]&lt;/ref&gt; hotels, corporations and various other charities. Her work has also been reproduced as note cards and prints.

==Personal==
Genet currently resides in [[Asheville, North Carolina]]. While she continues to hold "Jamaica as her muse",&lt;ref&gt;WNC Magazine (Western North Carolina Magazine), [http://www.wncmagazine.com/feature/in_good_taste/caribbean_queen "In Good Taste: Caribbean Queen"], July 2009&lt;/ref&gt; in recent years she has been inspired by the uniquely charming architecture in and around the City of Asheville. And has been painting some of Asheville's favorite scenes.&lt;ref&gt;Asheville Citizen-Times, [http://www.citizen-times.com/article/20100418/LIVING/304180022/COLLAGE-A-fresh-perspective-on-Asheville-landmarks%20Asheville%27s%20favorite%20scenes.

In the [[United Kingdom]], a '''Sloanie''' (or occasionally a '''Sloane Ranger''') is a [[stereotype|stereotypical]] young upper-middle or [[upper class]] person who pursues a distinctive fashionable lifestyle. The term is a [[portmanteau]] of "[[Sloane Square]]", a location in [[Chelsea, London]] famed for the wealth of residents and frequenters, and the television character ''[[The Lone Ranger]]''. 

==Social stratum==

The term dates from 1975, when aspiring writer [[Peter York]] had conversations with [[Ann Barr]] (then features editor of UK magazine ''[[Harper’s Bazaar|Harpers &amp; Queen]]'') about what had become a recognisable ''tribe'' of young people living in Chelsea and parts of [[Kensington]]. This led to an article for the magazine, defining the characteristics of this slice of English society.

Female Sloanes, especially those involved in [[English riding|equestrian activities]], were often seen in the 1970s around London wearing [[Hermès]] or [[Liberty (department store)|Liberty]] silk head scarves distinctively tied between the tip of the chin and the bottom lip, masking the lower part of the face, which furthered the "Lone Ranger" jest.

Several years passed before York and Barr collaborated on the ''Official Sloane Ranger Handbook'', which became a global bestseller in 1982.  The innovatory journalistic format and techniques from the 1975 article had by then become well established.  Ann Barr and her editorial team at ''Harpers &amp; Queen'' spent much time working on the original draft of the 1975 article. The potential of the piece, to become a talking point and to define a new form of social comment, was seen from the start. Barr and the sub-editors at the magazine devised many of the 'attributes' of a Sloane, added as boxes to the main text, in what became a widely imitated format. These delineated the habits and customs of the social group in question, from clothes, to shopping, to holiday venues, to choice of marital partner.

The Sloane Ranger proposal came from Martina (Tina) Margetts,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/features/3634284/Ann-Barr-The-woman-who-invented-Sloanes.html|title=Ann Barr: The woman who invented Sloanes|first=Cassandra|last=Jardine|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; a sub-editor on ''Harpers &amp; Queen'' who worked (with fellow sub-editor Laura Pank) on the 1975 article.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2006/dec/03/architecture.communities|title=The battle for Sloane Square|first=Stephen|last=Bayley|date=3 December 2006|publisher=|via=The Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt; In her early twenties she had found herself amongst this social group while undertaking a course on fine art at the Victoria and Albert Museum.

Initially the term "Sloane Ranger" was used mostly in reference to women, a particular archetype being [[Diana, Princess of Wales]]. However, the term now usually includes men. A male Sloane has also been referred to as a "[[Rah (slang)|Rah]]" and by the older term "[[Hooray Henry]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=On the trail of London's Sloane Rangers|publisher=The New York Times|date=25 March 1984|url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?sec=travel&amp;res=9C04EFD81139F936A15750C0A962948260}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The term Sloane Ranger has equivalent terms in other countries: in [[France]] they are called 'BCBG' (''[[bon chic bon genre]]''), while a near analogue in the [[United States]] is the [[preppy]] subculture.

==''The Official Sloane Ranger Handbook''==
[[Image:Sloane Ranger Handbook.jpg|thumb|right|Cover of ''The Official Sloane Ranger Handbook''. Lady Diana Spencer is pictured in centre.]]

''Sloane Ranger'', a commonplace term in 1980s London, was originally popularised by the British writers [[Peter York (author)|Peter York]] and [[Ann Barr]] in the book ''Style Wars'' (1980), followed by ''The Official Sloane Ranger Handbook'' (1982) and its companion ''The Official Sloane Ranger Diary.'' The books were published by the British society-watcher magazine ''[[Harpers &amp; Queen]]'', for whom Peter York was Style Editor and "was responsible for identifying the cult phenomena of "Sloane Rangers" and "[[Foodies]]".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.natmags.co.uk/about_us/timeline_harpers.asp "Harpers &amp; Queen Timeline"], ''The National Magazine Company'', 2006. {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070808161538/http://www.natmags.co.uk/about_us/timeline_harpers.asp |date=August 8, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The exemplar female Sloane Ranger was considered to be [[Diana, Princess of Wales|Lady Diana Spencer]] before marrying the [[Charles, Prince of Wales|Prince of Wales]], when she was a member of the aristocratic Spencer family. However, most Sloanes were not aristocrats as Lady Diana was. Considered typical of SRs was patriotism and traditionalism, and a belief in the values of upper class and upper-middle class culture, confidence in themselves and their given places in the world, a fondness for life in the countryside, country sports in particular, [[philistinism]] and [[anti-intellectualism]]. The title of the Sloane Ranger handbook lists the subheading "the problem of [[Hampstead]]", in reference to the stereotypical Sloane Ranger's supposed antipathy to the [[champagne socialist]] stereotype of the [[Hampstead#Hampstead Liberalism|Hampstead liberal]].

==Sloane territory==
{{Refimprove section|date=March 2008}}
Although Sloanes are nowadays supposedly more widely spread and amorphous than in the past, they are still perceived to socialise in the expensive areas of west London, most notably [[Kings Road]],&lt;ref name="Independent 19940102"&gt;{{cite news|last=Slot|first=Owen|title=Same Sloanes, new Range: Ten years after their handbook was a bestseller, Owen Slot finds Caroline and Henry are still doing OK, Yah|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/same-sloanes-new-range-ten-years-after-their-handbook-was-a-bestseller-owen-slot-finds-caroline-and-henry-are-still-doing-ok-yah-1397455.html|publisher=The Independent|accessdate=20 December 2011|date=2 January 1994}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Fulham Road]], [[Kensington High Street]], and other areas of [[Kensington]], [[Chelsea, London|Chelsea]] and [[Fulham]]. The pubs and nightclubs in these areas are popular with Sloanes, {{Citation needed|date=April 2009}} in particular the [[The White Horse, Fulham|White Horse]] pub, known as the "Sloaney Pony" in Fulham, and the Admiral Codrington, known as "The Cod", in Chelsea.&lt;ref name="Independent 19940102" /&gt;

Sloanes are associated with being educated at top-tier [[private school]]s, known as [[Independent School (UK)|public schools]] in England. The most well-known schools for Sloane Ranger boys are [[Eton College|Eton]], [[Harrow School|Harrow]], [[St Paul's School, London|St Paul's]], [[Westminster School|Westminster]], [[Sherborne School]] and [[Radley College|Radley]]. For girls, it's [[St George's School, Ascot]], [[Downe House School|Downe House]], [[St Mary's School, Calne]], [[St Paul's Girls' School]], [[Francis Holland School]], [[Wycombe Abbey School|Wycombe Abbey]] and [[Benenden School]]. For co-educational schools, it's [[Marlborough College]], [[Bradfield College]] and [[Wellington College, Berkshire|Wellington College]].

Young Sloanes aspire to attend the ancient universities of [[University of Oxford|Oxford]] and [[University of Cambridge|Cambridge]], or [[Durham University|Durham]], which have a reputation for upper class attendance. A number of other universities, however, have established reputations as havens for Sloanes, notably [[University of St Andrews|St Andrews]], [[University of Nottingham|Nottingham]], [[University of Leeds|Leeds]], [[University of London|the University of London]], [[University of Edinburgh|Edinburgh]], [[University of Exeter|Exeter]], [[University of Bristol|Bristol]], [[University of Bath|Bath]] and [[Newcastle University|Newcastle]].

Typically Sloane careers include banking, finance, PR, certain regiments of the British Army, chartered surveyors or journalism.

In 2015, Peter York argued that the Sloane population has been winnowed and that Sloanes were more likely to be leading the British trend to downward social mobility.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.prospectmagazine.co.uk/sound-and-vision/the-fall-of-the-sloane-rangers-made-in-chelsea|title=The fall of the Sloane Rangers  -  Prospect Magazine|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Safety Classes ==
Software classification is based on potential for hazard(s) that could cause injury to the user or patient.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.mddionline.com/article/developing-medical-device-software-iec-62304|title=Developing Medical Device Software to IEC 62304 {{!}} MDDI Medical Device and Diagnostic Industry News Products and Suppliers|website=www.mddionline.com|language=en|access-date=2017-06-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Per [[IEC 62304|IEC 62304:2006]], software can be divided into three separate classes:
* Class A: No injury or damage to health is possible
* Class B: Nonserious injury is possible
* Class C: Death or serious injury is possible

=== Serious injury ===

Injury or illness that directly or indirectly
* is life threatening
* results in permanent impairment of a body function or permanent damage to a body structure, or
* necessitates medical or surgical intervention to prevent permanent impairment of a body function or permanent damage to a body structure.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="61419">'''[[Molecular symmetry]]''' in [[physics]] and [[chemistry]] describes the [[symmetry]] present in [[molecule]]s and the classification of molecules according to their symmetry. Molecular symmetry is a fundamental concept in the application of [[Quantum Mechanics]] in physics and chemistry, for example it can be used to predict or explain many of a molecule's properties, such as its [[molecular dipole moment|&lt;nowiki/&gt;]][[dipole]] moment and its allowed [[spectroscopy|spectroscopic transitions]] (based on [[selection rules]]), without doing the exact rigorous calculations (which, in some cases, may not even be possible). [[Group theory]] is the predominant framework for analyzing molecular symmetry.

Among all the molecular symmetries, diatomic molecules show some distinct features and they are relatively easier to analyze.

== Symmetry and group theory ==
The physical laws governing a system is generally written as a relation (equations, differential equations, integral equations etc.). An operation on the ingredients of this relation, which keeps the form of the relations invariant is called a symmetry transformation or a symmetry of the system.
* These [[symmetry]] operations can involve external or internal co-ordinates; giving rise to geometrical or internal symmetries. 
* These symmetry operations can be global or local; giving rise to global or gauge symmetries.
* These symmetry operations can be discrete or continuous.
Symmetry is a fundamentally important concept in quantum mechanics. It can predict conserved quantities and provide quantum numbers. It can predict degeneracies of [[Eigenvalues and eigenvectors|eigenstate]]s and gives insights about the matrix elements of the [[Hamiltonian (quantum mechanics)|Hamiltonian]] without calculating them. Rather than looking into individual symmetries, it is sometimes more convenient to look into the general relations between the symmetries. It turns out that [[Group theory]] is the most efficient way of doing this.

=== Groups ===
{{Main|Group (mathematics)}}
A&amp;nbsp;''group''&amp;nbsp;is a mathematical structure (usually denoted in the form (''G'',*)) consisting of a set&amp;nbsp;''G''&amp;nbsp;and a [[binary operation]] &lt;math&gt;'*'&lt;/math&gt; (sometimes loosely called 'multiplication'), satisfying the following properties:
# '''&lt;u&gt;closure&lt;/u&gt;''': For every pair of elements &lt;math&gt;
x,y\in G
&lt;/math&gt;, the&amp;nbsp;''product''&amp;nbsp;&lt;math&gt;

x*y\in G
&lt;/math&gt;''.''
# '''&lt;u&gt;associativity&lt;/u&gt;''': For every&amp;nbsp;''x''&amp;nbsp;and&amp;nbsp;''y''&amp;nbsp;and&amp;nbsp;''z''&amp;nbsp;in&amp;nbsp;''G'', both (''x''*''y'')*''z''&amp;nbsp;and&amp;nbsp;''x''*(''y''*''z'') result with the same element in&amp;nbsp;''G''&amp;nbsp; ( in symbols, &lt;math&gt;(x*y)*z=x*(y*z)\forall x,y,z\in G&lt;/math&gt;).
# '''&lt;u&gt;existence of identity&lt;/u&gt;''': There must be an element ( say&amp;nbsp;''e''&amp;nbsp;) in&amp;nbsp;''G''&amp;nbsp;such that product any element of&amp;nbsp;''G''&amp;nbsp;with&amp;nbsp;''e''&amp;nbsp;make no change to the element ( in symbols,&amp;nbsp;&lt;math&gt;
x*e=e*x=x;\forall x\in G&lt;/math&gt;&amp;nbsp;).
# '''&lt;u&gt;existence of inverse&lt;/u&gt;''': For each element (&amp;nbsp;''x''&amp;nbsp;) in&amp;nbsp;''G'', there must be an element&amp;nbsp;''y''&amp;nbsp;in&amp;nbsp;''G''&amp;nbsp;such that product of&amp;nbsp;''x''&amp;nbsp;and&amp;nbsp;''y''&amp;nbsp;is the identity element&amp;nbsp;''e''&amp;nbsp; ( in symbols, for each &lt;math&gt;
x\in G
&lt;/math&gt;&lt;math&gt;
\text{ }\exists \text{ }y\in G
&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;
x*y=y*x=e
&lt;/math&gt;).
* In addition to the above four, if it so happens that &lt;math&gt;
\forall x,y\in G&lt;/math&gt;,&lt;math&gt;
x*y=y*x
&lt;/math&gt;, i.e., the operation in '''commutative,''' then the group is called an [[Abelian Group]]. Otherwise it is called a [[Non-abelian group|Non-Abelian Group]].

=== Groups, symmetry and conservation  ===
{{Main|Symmetry in quantum mechanics}}The set of all symmetry transformations of a [[Hamiltonian (quantum mechanics)|Hamiltonian]] has the structure of a group, with group multiplication equivalent to applying the transformations one after the other. The group elements can be represented as matrices, so that the group operation becomes the ordinary matrix multiplication. In quantum mechanics, the evolution of an arbitrary superposition of states are given by unitary operators, so each of the elements of the symmetry groups are unitary operators. Now any unitary operator can be expressed as the exponential of some [[Hermitian operator]] . So, the corresponding Hermitian operators are the '[[Generating set of a group|generators]]' of the [[symmetry group]]. These unitary transformations act on the Hamiltonian operator in some [[Hilbert space]] in a way that the Hamiltonian remains invariant under the transformations. In other words, the symmetry operators commute with the Hamiltonian. If &lt;math&gt;U&lt;/math&gt; represents the [[Unitary operator|unitary symmetry operator]] and acts on the Hamiltonian &lt;math&gt;H&lt;/math&gt;, then;

{| class="wikitable collapsible collapsed"
! &lt;math&gt;[H,U]=0&lt;/math&gt;
|-
| &lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
  &amp; {H}'={{U}^{\dagger }}HU=H \\ 
 &amp; \Rightarrow HU=UH \\ 
 &amp; \Rightarrow [H,U]=0;\forall U\in G \\ 
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;
|}

These operators have the above-mentioned properties of a group: 
* The symmetry operations are closed under multiplication. 
* Application of symmetry transformations are associative.
* There is always a trivial transformation, where nothing is done to the original co-ordinates. This is the identity element of the group. 
* And as long as an inverse transformation exists, it is a symmetry transformation, i.e. it leaves the Hamiltonian invariant. Thus the inverse is part of this set. 
So, by the symmetry of a system, we mean a set of operators, each of which [[commutator|commutes]] with the Hamiltonian, and they form a [[symmetry group]]. This group may be Abelian or Non-Abelian. Depending upon which one it is, the properties of the system changes (for example, if the group is Abelian, there would be no [[Degeneracy (quantum mechanics)|degeneracy]]). Corresponding to every different kind of symmetry in a system, we can find a symmetry group associated with it.

It follows that the generator &lt;math&gt;T&lt;/math&gt; of the symmetry group also commutes with the Hamiltonian. Now, it follows that:
{| class="wikitable collapsible collapsed"
! The observable corresponding to the generator Hermitian matrix, is conserved.
|-
| The derivative of the expectation value of the operator T can be written as:
&lt;math&gt;\frac{d\left\langle T \right\rangle }{dt}=\frac{d\left\langle \Psi |T|\Psi  \right\rangle }{dt}=\left\langle \frac{\partial \Psi }{\partial t}|T|\Psi  \right\rangle +\left\langle \Psi |\frac{\partial T}{\partial t}|\Psi  \right\rangle +\left\langle \Psi |T|\frac{\partial \Psi }{\partial t} \right\rangle &lt;/math&gt;

Now,

&lt;math&gt;i\hbar \frac{\partial \left| \Psi  \right\rangle }{\partial t}=H\left| \Psi  \right\rangle &lt;/math&gt;

So,

&lt;math&gt;\frac{d\left\langle T \right\rangle }{dt}=-\frac{1}{i\hbar }\left\langle \Psi |HT|\Psi  \right\rangle +\frac{1}{i\hbar }\left\langle \Psi |TH|\Psi  \right\rangle +\left\langle \frac{\partial T}{\partial t} \right\rangle  &lt;/math&gt;

as H is also Hermitian. So we have,

&lt;math&gt;\frac{d\left\langle T \right\rangle }{dt}=\frac{1}{i\hbar }\left\langle [H,T] \right\rangle +\left\langle \frac{\partial T}{\partial t} \right\rangle  &lt;/math&gt;

Now, &lt;math&gt;[H,T]=0 &lt;/math&gt; as stated above, and if the operator T does not have any explicit time-dependence;

&lt;math&gt;\frac{d\left\langle T \right\rangle }{dt}=0 &lt;/math&gt; &lt;math&gt;\Rightarrow \left\langle T \right\rangle  &lt;/math&gt; is a constant, independent of what the state &lt;math&gt;\left| \Psi  \right\rangle &lt;/math&gt; may be.

So the observable corresponding to the operator T, is conserved.
|}
Some specific examples can be systems having [[Rotational symmetry|rotational]], [[translational invariance]] etc.. For a rotationally invariant system, The symmetry group of the Hamiltonian is the general rotation group. Now, if (say) the system is invariant about any rotation about Z-axis (i.e., the system has [[axial symmetry]]), then the symmetry group of the Hamiltonian is the group of rotation about the symmetry axis. Now, this group is generated by the Z-component of the orbital angular momentum, &lt;math&gt;{{L}}_{{z}}&lt;/math&gt; (general group element &lt;math&gt;R(\alpha )={{e}^{\frac{-i\alpha {{L}_{z}}}{\hbar }}}
&lt;/math&gt;). Thus, &lt;math&gt;{{L}}_{{z}}&lt;/math&gt; commutes with &lt;math&gt;H&lt;/math&gt; for this system and Z-component of the angular momentum is conserved. Similarly, translation symmetry gives rise to conservation of linear momentum, inversion symmetry gives rise to parity conservation and so on.

== Geometrical symmetries ==

=== Symmetry operations, point groups and permutation-inversion groups ===
{{Main|Molecular symmetry}}
A molecule at equilibrium in a certain electronic state usually has some geometrical symmetry.This symmetry is described by a certain [[point group]] which consists of operations (called symmetry operations) that produce a spatial orientation of the molecule that is indistinguishable from the starting configuration. There are five types of point group symmetry operation: identity, rotation, reflection, inversion and [[improper rotation]] or rotation-reflection. Common to all symmetry operations is that the geometrical center-point of the molecule does not change its position; hence the name [[point group]]. One  can determine the elements of the point group for a particular molecule by considering the geometrical symmetry of its molecular model. However, when one uses a point group, the elements are not to be interpreted in the same way. Instead the elements rotate and/or reflect the vibronic (vibration-electronic) coordinates and these elements commute with the vibronic Hamiltonian. The point group is used to classify by symmetry the vibronic eigenstates. The symmetry classification of the rotational levels, the eigenstates of the full (rovibronic nuclear spin) Hamiltonian, requires the use of the appropriate permutation-inversion group as introduced by [[H. Christopher Longuet-Higgins|Longuet-Higgins]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Longuet-Higgins | first1 = H.C. | year = 1963 | title = The symmetry groups of non-rigid molecules | url = | journal = Molecular Physics | volume = 6 | issue = 5| pages = 445–460 | doi = 10.1080/00268976300100501 | bibcode = 1963MolPh...6..445L }}&lt;/ref&gt;. See the Section "Inversion symmetry and nuclear permutation symmetry" below, and [https://chemphys.ca/pbunker/PointGroupspdffile.html Link] 
.  The elements of permutation-inversion groups commute with the full molecular Hamiltonian. In addition to point groups, there exists another kind of group important in [[crystallography]], where translation in 3-D also needs to be taken care of. They are known as [[space group]]s.

=== Basic point group symmetry operations ===
The five basic symmetry operations mentioned above are:&lt;ref&gt;http://csi.chemie.tu-darmstadt.de/ak/immel/script/redirect.cgi?filename=http://csi.chemie.tu-darmstadt.de/ak/immel/tutorials/symmetry/index1.html&lt;/ref&gt;
# '''Identity Operation&amp;nbsp;E '''(from the German 'Einheit' meaning unity)''':'' '''''The identity operation leaves the molecule unchanged. It forms the identity element in the symmetry group. Though its inclusion seems to be trivial, it is important also because even for the most asymmetric molecule, this symmetry is present. The corresponding symmetry element is the entire molecule itself. 
# '''Inversion, ''i '': '''This operation inverts the molecule about its center of inversion (if it has any). The center of inversion is the symmetry element in this case. There may or may not be an atom at this center. A molecule may or may not have a center of inversion. For example: the benzene molecule, a cube, and spheres do have a center of inversion, whereas a tetrahedron does not.
# '''Reflection σ: '''The&amp;nbsp;reflection&amp;nbsp;operation produces a mirror image geometry of the molecule about a certain plane. The&amp;nbsp;mirror plane&amp;nbsp;bisects the molecule and must include its center of geometry. The plane of symmetry is the symmetry element in this case. A symmetry plane&amp;nbsp;parallel&amp;nbsp;with the principal axis (defined below)  is dubbed&amp;nbsp;vertical&amp;nbsp;(σ&lt;sub&gt;v&lt;/sub&gt;) and one perpendicular to it horizontal&amp;nbsp;(σ&lt;sub&gt;h&lt;/sub&gt;). A third type of symmetry plane exists: If a vertical symmetry plane additionally bisects the angle between two 2-fold rotation axes perpendicular to the principal axis, the plane is dubbed&amp;nbsp;dihedral&amp;nbsp;(σ&lt;sub&gt;d&lt;/sub&gt;).
# '''''n''-Fold Rotation&amp;nbsp;'''&lt;math&gt;
{{c}_{n}}&lt;/math&gt;''''': '''''The&amp;nbsp;n-fold rotation&amp;nbsp;operation about a&amp;nbsp;n-fold axis of symmetry&amp;nbsp; produces molecular orientations indistinguishable from the initial for each rotation of &amp;nbsp;&lt;math&gt;
\frac{{{360}^{0}}}{n}&lt;/math&gt; (clockwise and counter-clockwise).It is denoted by &lt;math&gt;
{{c}_{n}}&lt;/math&gt;. The axis of symmetry is the symmetry element in this case. A molecule can have more than one symmetry axis; the one with the highest&amp;nbsp;''n''&amp;nbsp;is called the&amp;nbsp;'''principal axis''', and by convention is assigned the z-axis in a&amp;nbsp;Cartesian coordinate system.
# '''''n''-Fold Rotation-Reflection&amp;nbsp;or improper rotation ''S&lt;sub&gt;n &lt;/sub&gt;: '''''The&amp;nbsp;n-fold improper rotation operation about an&amp;nbsp;n-fold axis of improper rotation is composed of two successive geometry transformations: first, a rotation through &lt;math&gt;
\frac{{{360}^{0}}}{n}&lt;/math&gt;&amp;nbsp;about the axis of that rotation, and second, reflection through a plane perpendicular (and through the molecular center of geometry) to that axis. This axis is the symmetry element in this case. It is abbreviated S&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;.
It is to be noted that all other symmetry present in a specific molecule are a combination of these 5 operations.

=== Schoenflies notation ===
{{Main|Schoenflies notation}}
The&amp;nbsp;'''Schoenflies'''&amp;nbsp;(or&amp;nbsp;'''Schönflies''')&amp;nbsp;'''notation''', named after the&amp;nbsp;German&amp;nbsp;mathematician&amp;nbsp;[[Arthur Moritz Schoenflies]], is one of two conventions commonly used to describe&amp;nbsp;point groups. This notation is used in&amp;nbsp;spectroscopy and is used here to specify a molecular point group.

== Point groups for diatomic molecules ==
{{Main|Molecular symmetry}}
There are two point groups for diatomic molecules: &lt;math&gt;
{{C}_{\infty v}}
&lt;/math&gt; for heteronuclear diatomics, and &lt;math&gt;
{{D}_{\infty h}}
&lt;/math&gt; for homonuclear diatomics.
* &lt;u&gt;&lt;math&gt;
{{C}_{\infty v}}
&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/u&gt;:
The group &lt;math&gt;
{{C}_{\infty v}}
&lt;/math&gt;, contains rotations &lt;math&gt;
C(\phi )
&lt;/math&gt; through any angle &lt;math&gt;
\phi 
&lt;/math&gt; about the axis of symmetry and an infinite number of reflections &lt;math&gt;
{{\sigma }_{v}}&lt;/math&gt; through the planes containing the inter-nuclear axis (or the vertical axis, that is reason of the subscript '&lt;nowiki/&gt;''v''&lt;nowiki/&gt;').In the group &lt;math&gt;
{{C}_{\infty v}}
&lt;/math&gt; all planes of symmetry are equivalent, so that all reflections &lt;math&gt;
{{\sigma }_{v}}&lt;/math&gt; form a single class with a continuous series of elements; the axis of symmetry is bilateral, so that there is a continuous series of classes, each containing two elements &lt;math&gt;
C(\pm \phi )
&lt;/math&gt;. Note that this group is '''''Non-abelian''''' and there exists an infinite number of irreducible representations in the group. The character table of the group is as follows:

In addition to axial reflection symmetry, [[Homonuclear molecule|homonuclear diatomic molecules]] are symmetric with respect to inversion or reflection through any axis in the plane passing through the point of symmetry and perpendicular to the inter-nuclear axis.[[File:Inversion2.png|thumb|350x300px|Inversion symmetry in homonuclear diatomic molecules, giving rise to symmetry group &lt;math&gt;

{{D}_{\infty h}}&lt;/math&gt; can be obtained from those of the group &lt;u&gt;&lt;math&gt;
{{C}_{\infty v}}
&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/u&gt; using the relation between the two groups: &lt;math&gt;
{{D}_{\infty h}}={{C}_{\infty v}}\times {{C}_{i}}&lt;/math&gt;. Like &lt;u&gt;&lt;math&gt;
{{C}_{\infty v}}
&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/u&gt;, &lt;math&gt;

== Complete set of commuting operators ==
{{Main|Complete set of commuting observables}}
Unlike a single atom, the Hamiltonian of a diatomic molecule doesn't commute with &lt;math&gt;{{L}^{2}}&lt;/math&gt;. So the quantum number &lt;math&gt;l&lt;/math&gt; is no longer a [[good quantum number]]. The internuclear axis chooses a specific direction in space and the potential is no longer spherically symmetric. Instead, &lt;math&gt;{{L}_{z}}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;{{J}_{z}}&lt;/math&gt; commutes with the Hamiltonian &lt;math&gt;H&lt;/math&gt; (taking the arbitrary internuclear axis as the ''Z'' axis). But &lt;math&gt;{{L}_{x}},{{L}_{y}}&lt;/math&gt; do not commute with &lt;math&gt;H&lt;/math&gt; due to the fact that the electronic Hamiltonian of a diatomic molecule is invariant under rotations about the internuclear line (the ''Z'' axis), but not under rotations about the ''X'' or ''Y'' axes. Again, &lt;math&gt;{{S}^{2}}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;{{S}_{z}}&lt;/math&gt; act on a different Hilbert space, so they commute with &lt;math&gt;H&lt;/math&gt; in this case also. The electronic Hamiltonian for a diatomic molecule is also invariant under reflections in all planes containing the internuclear line. The (''X-Z'') plane is such a plane, and reflection of the coordinates of the electrons in this plane corresponds to the operation &lt;math&gt;{{y}_{i}}\to -{{y}_{i}}&lt;/math&gt;. If &lt;math&gt;{{A}_{y}}&lt;/math&gt; is the operator that performs this reflection, then &lt;math&gt;[{{A}_{y}},H]=0&lt;/math&gt;. So the [[Complete set of commuting observables|Complete Set of Commuting Operators]] (CSCO) for a general [[Heteronuclear molecule|heteronuclear diatomic molecule]] is &lt;math&gt;\{H,\text{ }{{J}_{z}},{{L}_{z}},{{S}^{2}},{{S}_{z}},A\}&lt;/math&gt;; where &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; is an operator that inverts only one of the two spatial co-ordinates (''x or y). ''

In the special case of a homonuclear diatomic molecule, there is an extra symmetry since in addition to the axis of symmetry provided by the internuclear axis, there is a centre of symmetry at the midpoint of the distance between the two nuclei (the symmetry discussed in this paragraph only depends on the two nuclear charges being the same. The two nuclei can therefore have different mass, that is they can be two isotopes of the same species such as the proton and the deuteron, or &lt;math&gt;{{O}^{16}}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;{{O}^{18}}&lt;/math&gt;, and so on). Choosing this point as the origin of the coordinates, the Hamiltonian is invariant under an inversion of the coordinates of all electrons with respect to that origin, namely in the operation &lt;math&gt;{{\vec{r}}_{i}}\to -{{\vec{r}}_{i}}&lt;/math&gt;. Thus the parity operator &lt;math&gt;\Pi &lt;/math&gt;. Thus the CSCO for a homonuclear diatomic molecule is &lt;math&gt;\left\{ H,\text{ }{{J}_{z}},{{L}_{z}},{{S}^{2}},{{S}_{z}},A,\text{ }\Pi  \right\}&lt;/math&gt;.

==&lt;nowiki/&gt;Molecular term symbol, Λ-doubling ==
{{main|Molecular term symbol}}
'''[[Molecular term symbol]]'''&amp;nbsp;is a shorthand expression of the&amp;nbsp;group representation&amp;nbsp;and&amp;nbsp;angular momenta&amp;nbsp;that characterize the state of a&amp;nbsp;molecule. It is the equivalent of the&amp;nbsp;[[term symbol]]&amp;nbsp;for the atomic case. We already know the CSCO of the most general diatomic molecule. So, the [[good quantum number]]s can sufficiently describe the state of the diatomic molecule. Here, the symmetry is explicitly stated in the nomenclature.

=== Angular momentum ===

Here, the system is not spherically symmetric. So, &lt;math&gt;[H,{{L}^{2}}]\ne 0&lt;/math&gt;, and the state cannot be depicted in terms of &lt;math&gt;l&lt;/math&gt; as an eigenstate of the Hamiltonian is not an eigenstate of &lt;math&gt;{{L}^{2}}
&lt;/math&gt; anymore (in contrast to the atomic term symbol, where the states were written as &lt;math&gt;^{2S+1}{{L}_{J}}&lt;/math&gt;). But, as &lt;math&gt;[H,{{L}_{z}}]= 0&lt;/math&gt;, the eigenvalues corresponding to &lt;math&gt;{{L}_{z}}&lt;/math&gt; can still be used. If,

&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
  &amp; {{L}_{z}}\left| \Psi  \right\rangle ={{M}_{L}}\hbar \left| \Psi  \right\rangle ;{{M}_{L}}=0,\pm 1,\pm 2,.......... \\ 
 &amp; \Rightarrow {{L}_{z}}\left| \Psi  \right\rangle =\pm \Lambda \hbar \left| \Psi  \right\rangle ;\Lambda =0,1,2,........... \\ 
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\Lambda =\left| {{M}_{L}} \right|&lt;/math&gt; is the absolute value (in a.u.) of the projection of the total electronic angular momentum on the internuclear axis; &lt;math&gt;\Lambda 
&lt;/math&gt; can be used as a term symbol. By analogy with the spectroscopic notation S, P, D, F, ... used for atoms, it is customary to associate code letters with the values of &lt;math&gt;\Lambda 
&lt;/math&gt; according to the correspondence:
[[File:term1.gif|center|300x300px]]

For the individual electrons, the notation and the correspondence used are:

&lt;math&gt;\lambda =\left| {{m}_{l}} \right|&lt;/math&gt; and
[[File:term2.gif|center|300x300px]]

=== Axial symmetry ===

Again, &lt;math&gt;[{{A}_{y}},H]=0&lt;/math&gt;, and in addition: &lt;math&gt;{{A}_{y}}{{L}_{z}}=-{{L}_{z}}{{A}_{y}}&lt;/math&gt; [as &lt;math&gt;{{L}_{z}}=-i\hbar (x\frac{\partial }{\partial y}-y\frac{\partial }{\partial x})&lt;/math&gt;]. It follows immediately that if &lt;math&gt;\Lambda \ne 0&lt;/math&gt; the action of the operator &lt;math&gt;{{A}_{y}}&lt;/math&gt; on an eigenstate corresponding to the eigenvalue &lt;math&gt;\Lambda \hbar&lt;/math&gt; of &lt;math&gt;{{L}}_{{z}}&lt;/math&gt; converts this state into another one corresponding to the eigenvalue &lt;math&gt;-\Lambda \hbar&lt;/math&gt;, and that both eigenstates have the same energy. The electronic terms such that &lt;math&gt;\Lambda \ne 0&lt;/math&gt; (that is, the terms &lt;math&gt;\Pi ,\Delta ,\Phi ,................&lt;/math&gt;) are thus doubly degenerate, each value of the energy corresponding to two states which differ by the direction of the projection of the orbital angular momentum along the molecular axis. This twofold degeneracy is actually only approximate and it is possible to show that the interaction between the electronic and rotational motions leads to a splitting of the terms with &lt;math&gt;\Lambda \ne 0&lt;/math&gt; into two nearby levels, which is called &lt;math&gt;\Lambda 
&lt;/math&gt;'''''-doubling'''''.&lt;ref name="Bransden"&gt;{{Cite book

&lt;math&gt;\Lambda=0&lt;/math&gt; corresponds to the &lt;math&gt;\Sigma &lt;/math&gt; states. These states are non-degenerate, so that the states of a &lt;math&gt;\Sigma &lt;/math&gt; term can only be multiplied by a constant in a reflection through a plane containing the molecular axis. When &lt;math&gt;\Lambda=0&lt;/math&gt;, simultaneous eigenfunctions of &lt;math&gt;H&lt;/math&gt;,&lt;math&gt;{{L}}_{{z}}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;{{A}}_{{y}}&lt;/math&gt; can be constructed. Since &lt;math&gt;A_{y}^{2}=1&lt;/math&gt;, the eigenfunctions of &lt;math&gt;{{A}}_{{y}}&lt;/math&gt; have eigenvalues &lt;math&gt;\pm 1&lt;/math&gt;. So to completely specify &lt;math&gt;\Sigma &lt;/math&gt; states of diatomic molecules, &lt;math&gt;{{\Sigma }^{+}}&lt;/math&gt; states, which  is left unchanged upon reflection in a plane containing the nuclei, needs to be distinguished from &lt;math&gt;{{\Sigma }^{-}}&lt;/math&gt; states, for which it changes sign in performing that operation.

=== Inversion symmetry and nuclear permutation symmetry ===

Homonuclear diatomic molecules have a center of symmetry at their midpoint. Choosing this point as the origin of the coordinates, the electronic Hamiltonian is invariant under the point group operation '''''i''''' of inversion of the coordinates of all electrons at that origin. This operation is not the parity operation P (or E*); the parity operation involves the inversion of nuclear and electronic spatial coordinates at the molecular center of mass. Electronic states are either even, i.e. remain unchanged by the operation '''''i''''', or they are odd, i.e. changed in sign by '''''i'''''. The former are denoted by the subscript '''''g''''' and are called '''''gerade, '''''while the latter are denoted by the subscript '''''u''''' and are called '''''ungerade.''''' The subscripts '''''g''''' or '''''u''''' are therefore added to the term symbol, so that for homonuclear diatomic molecules we have &lt;math&gt;{{\Sigma }_{g}},{{\Sigma }_{u}},{{\Pi }_{g}},{{\Pi }_{u}},......&lt;/math&gt; electronic states. A homonuclear diatomic molecule has four non-degenerate &lt;math&gt;\Sigma &lt;/math&gt; electronic states: &lt;math&gt;\Sigma _{g}^{+},\Sigma _{g}^{-},\Sigma _{u}^{+},\Sigma _{u}^{-}&lt;/math&gt;. Vibronic states are classified according to the irreducible representations of the appropriate point group.

The complete Hamiltonian of a diatomic molecule (as for all molecules) commutes with the parity operation P or E* and rovibronic energy levels (usually called rotational levels) can be given the parity symmetry label '''''+''''' or '''''-'''''. The complete Hamiltonian of a homonuclear diatomic molecule also commutes with the operation
of permuting (or exchanging) the coordinates of the two (identical) nuclei and rotational levels 
gain the additional label '''''s''''' or '''''a''''' depending on whether the total wavefunction is
unchanged (symmetric) or changed in sign (antisymmetric) by the permutation operation. Thus, the rotational levels of heteronuclear diatomic molecules are labelled '''''+''''' or '''''-''''', whereas those of homonuclear diatomic
molecules are labelled '''''+s''''', '''''+a''''', '''''-s''''' or '''''-a'''''. The rovibronic nuclear spin states are classified using the appropriate permutation-inversion group.&lt;ref&gt;Philip R. Bunker and Per Jensen (2005), ''Fundamentals of Molecular Symmetry'' (Institute of Physics Publishing) {{ISBN|0-7503-0941-5}} Section 8.3.4&lt;/ref&gt;

The complete Hamiltonian of a homonuclear diatomic molecule (as for all centro-symmetric molecules)
does not commute with the point group inversion operation '''''i''''' because of the effect of the nuclear hyperfine Hamiltonian. The nuclear hyperfine Hamiltonian can mix the rotational levels of '''''g''''' and '''''u''''' vibronic states (called '''''ortho'''''-'''''para''''' mixing) and give
rise to '''''ortho'''''-'''''para''''' transitions&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Pique | first = J.

=== [[Spin (physics)|Spin]] and [[total angular momentum]] ===

If '''''S '''''denotes the resultant of the individual electron spins, &lt;math&gt;s(s+1){{\hbar }^{2}}&lt;/math&gt; are the eigenvalues of '''''S '''''and as in the case of atoms, each electronic term of the molecule is also characterised by the value of '''''S'''''. If spin-orbit coupling is neglected, there is a degeneracy of order &lt;math&gt;2s+1&lt;/math&gt; associated with each &lt;math&gt;s&lt;/math&gt; for a given &lt;math&gt;\Lambda 
&lt;/math&gt;. Just as for atoms, the quantity &lt;math&gt;2s+1&lt;/math&gt; is called the multiplicity of the term and.is written as a (left) superscript, so that the term symbol is written as &lt;math&gt;{}^{2s+1}\Lambda &lt;/math&gt;. For example, the symbol &lt;math&gt;{}^{3}\Pi &lt;/math&gt;denotes a term such that &lt;math&gt;\Lambda =2
&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;s=1
&lt;/math&gt;. It is worth noting that the ground state (often labelled by the symbol &lt;math&gt;X
&lt;/math&gt;) of most diatomic molecules is such that &lt;math&gt;s=0
&lt;/math&gt; and exhibits maximum symmetry. Thus, in most cases it is a &lt;math&gt;{}^{1}{{\Sigma }^{+}}
&lt;/math&gt; state (written as &lt;math&gt;X{}^{1}{{\Sigma }^{+}}
&lt;/math&gt;, excited states are written with &lt;math&gt;A,B,C,...&lt;/math&gt; in front) for a heteronuclear molecule and a &lt;math&gt;{}^{1}\Sigma _{g}^{+}
&lt;/math&gt; state (written as &lt;math&gt;X{}^{1}\Sigma _{g}^{+}
&lt;/math&gt;) for a homonuclear molecule.

Spin–orbit coupling lifts the degeneracy of the electronic states. This is because the ''z''-component of spin interacts with the ''z''-component of the orbital angular momentum, generating a total electronic angular momentum along the molecule axis '''J'''&lt;sub&gt;z&lt;/sub&gt;. This is characterized by the quantum number &lt;math&gt;{{M}_{J}}
&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;{{M}_{J}}={{M}_{S}}+{{M}_{L}}
&lt;/math&gt;. Again, positive and negative values of &lt;math&gt;{{M}_{J}}
&lt;/math&gt; are degenerate, so the pairs (''M&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt;'', ''M&lt;sub&gt;S&lt;/sub&gt;'') and (−''M&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt;'', −''M&lt;sub&gt;S&lt;/sub&gt;'') are degenerate. These pairs are grouped together with the quantum number &lt;math&gt;\Omega

&lt;/math&gt;, which is defined as the sum of the pair of values (''M&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt;'', ''M&lt;sub&gt;S&lt;/sub&gt;'') for which ''M&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt;'' is positive: &lt;math&gt;\Omega =\Lambda +{{M}_{S}}

&lt;/math&gt;

=== Molecular term symbol ===

So, the overall molecular term symbol for the most general diatomic molecule is given by:

&lt;math&gt;{}^{2S+1}\!\Lambda^{(+/-)}_{\Omega,(g/u)}
&lt;/math&gt;

where
* '''''S '''''is the total spin quantum number
* &lt;math&gt;\Lambda 
&lt;/math&gt; is the projection of the orbital angular momentum along the internuclear axis
* &lt;math&gt;\Omega

&lt;/math&gt; is the projection of the total angular momentum along the internuclear axis
* '''''u'''''/'''''g''''' is the effect of the point group operation '''''i'''''
* '''''+/&amp;#x2212;''''' is the reflection symmetry along an arbitrary plane containing the internuclear axis

{{main|Avoided crossing}}

=== Effect of symmetry on the matrix elements of the Hamiltonian ===
The electronic terms or potential curves &lt;math&gt;{{E}_{S}}(R)&lt;/math&gt; of a diatomic molecule depend only on the internuclear distance &lt;math&gt;R
&lt;/math&gt;, and it is important to investigate the behaviour of these potential curves as R varies.It is of considerable interest to examine the intersection of the curves representing the different terms.
[[File:wigner2014.png|thumb|258x258px|The non-crossing rule of von Neumann and Wigner. Two potential curves &lt;math&gt;{{E}_{1}}(R)
&lt;/math&gt;&lt;span&gt; and &lt;/span&gt;&lt;math&gt;{{E}_{2}}(R)
&lt;/math&gt; cannot cross if the states 1 and 2 have the same point group symmetry]]
Let &lt;math&gt;{{E}_{1}}(R)
&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;{{E}_{2}}(R)
&lt;/math&gt; two different electronic potential curves. If they intersect at some point, then the functions &lt;math&gt;{{E}_{1}}(R)
&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;{{E}_{2}}(R)
&lt;/math&gt; will have neighbouring values near this point. To decide whether such an intersection can occur, it is convenient to put the problem as follows. Suppose at some internuclear distance &lt;math&gt;{{R}}_{{c}}
&lt;/math&gt; the values &lt;math&gt;{{E}_{1}}({{R}_{C}})
&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;{{E}_{2}}({{R}_{C}})
&lt;/math&gt; are close, but distinct (as shown in the figure). Then it is to be examined whether or &lt;math&gt;{{E}_{1}}(R)
&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;{{E}_{2}}(R)
&lt;/math&gt; can be made to intersect by the modification &lt;math&gt;{{R}_{C}}\to {{R}_{C}}+\Delta R
&lt;/math&gt;. The energies &lt;math&gt;E_{1}^{(0)}={{E}_{1}}({{R}_{C}})
&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;E_{2}^{(0)}={{E}_{2}}({{R}_{C}})
&lt;/math&gt; are eigenvalues of the Hamiltonian &lt;math&gt;{{H}_{0}}=H({{R}_{C}})
&lt;/math&gt;. The corresponding orthonormal electronic eigenstates will be denoted by &lt;math&gt;\left| \Phi _{1}^{(0)} \right\rangle
&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\left| \Phi _{2}^{(0)} \right\rangle
&lt;/math&gt; and are assumed to be real.
The Hamiltonian now becomes &lt;math&gt;H\equiv H({{R}_{C}}+\Delta R)={{H}_{0}}+H'
&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;H'=\frac{\partial {{H}_{0}}}{\partial {{R}_{C}}}\Delta R
&lt;/math&gt; is the small perturbation operator (though it is a degenerate case, so ordinary method of perturbation won't work). setting &lt;math&gt;H_{ij}^{'}=\left\langle \Phi _{i}^{(0)}|H'|\Phi _{j}^{(0)} \right\rangle ;i,j=1,2
&lt;/math&gt;, it can be deduced that in order for &lt;math&gt;{{E}_{1}}(R)
&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;{{E}_{2}}(R)
&lt;/math&gt; to be equal at the point &lt;math&gt;{{R}_{C}}+\Delta R
&lt;/math&gt; the following two conditions are required to be fulfilled:
{| class="wikitable collapsible collapsed"
! &lt;math&gt;E_{1}^{(0)}-E_{2}^{(0)}+H_{11}^{'}-H_{22}^{'}=0&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;H_{12}^{'}=0&lt;/math&gt;
|-
|As an initial zero-order approximation, instead of &lt;math&gt;\left| \Phi _{1}^{(0)} \right\rangle
&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\left| \Phi _{2}^{(0)} \right\rangle
&lt;/math&gt; themselves, linear combinations of them of the form &lt;math&gt;\left| {{\Phi }^{(0)}} \right\rangle ={{c}_{1}}\left| \Phi _{1}^{(0)} \right\rangle +{{c}_{2}}\left| \Phi _{2}^{(0)} \right\rangle &lt;/math&gt;, can be taken as the [[eigenstate]] of the Hamiltonian &lt;math&gt;H&lt;/math&gt; (where &lt;math&gt;{{c}_{1}}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;{{c}_{2}}&lt;/math&gt; are, in general, complex). Substituting this expression in the perturbed  [[Schroedinger's equation|Schrödinger'''&amp;nbsp;''' equation]]:

&lt;math&gt;({{H}_{0}}+H')\left| {{\Phi }^{(0)}} \right\rangle =E\left| {{\Phi }^{(0)}} \right\rangle &lt;/math&gt;

Expanding:

&lt;math&gt;
{{c}_{1}}(E_{1}^{(0)}+H'-E)\left| \Phi _{1}^{(0)} \right\rangle +{{c}_{2}}(E_{2}^{(0)}+H'-E)\left| \Phi _{2}^{(0)} \right\rangle =0
&lt;/math&gt;

Taking inner product with the respective bra's:

&lt;math&gt;
{{c}_{1}}(E_{1}^{(0)}+H'-E)\left\langle \Phi _{1}^{(0)}|\Phi _{1}^{(0)} \right\rangle +{{c}_{2}}(E_{2}^{(0)}+H'-E)\left\langle \Phi _{1}^{(0)}|\Phi _{2}^{(0)} \right\rangle =0
&lt;/math&gt;; and

&lt;/math&gt;

Now, &lt;math&gt;\left| \Phi _{1}^{(0)} \right\rangle
&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\left| \Phi _{2}^{(0)} \right\rangle
&lt;/math&gt;  are eigenstates of the Hamiltonian &lt;math&gt;
{{H}_{0}}
&lt;/math&gt; corresponding to different [[eigenvalues]] and as &lt;math&gt;
{{H}_{0}}
&lt;/math&gt; is itself Hermitian, They are [[orthonormal]]: &lt;math&gt;
\left\langle \Phi _{i}^{(0)}|\Phi _{j}^{(0)} \right\rangle ={{\delta }_{ij}}
&lt;/math&gt;

Thus:

&lt;math&gt;
{{c}_{1}}(E_{1}^{(0)}+H_{11}^{'}-E)+{{c}_{2}}H_{12}^{'}=0
&lt;/math&gt;; and

&lt;math&gt;
{{c}_{1}}H_{21}^{'}+{{c}_{2}}(E_{2}^{(0)}+H_{22}^{'}-E)=0
&lt;/math&gt;

Since the operator &lt;math&gt;
H'
&lt;/math&gt; is Hermitian, the matrix elements &lt;math&gt;
H_{11}^{'}
&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;
H_{22}^{'}
&lt;/math&gt; are real, while &lt;math&gt;
H_{12}^{'}=H_{21}^{'*}
&lt;/math&gt;. The compatibility condition for these equations is (such that both &lt;math&gt;{{c}_{1}}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;{{c}_{2}}&lt;/math&gt; are not simultaneously zero):

&lt;math&gt;
\left| \begin{matrix}
   E_{1}^{(0)}+H_{11}^{'}-E &amp; H_{12}^{'}  \\
   H_{21}^{'} &amp; E_{2}^{(0)}+H_{22}^{'}-E  \\
\end{matrix} \right|=0
&lt;/math&gt;

This gives: &lt;math&gt;
E=\frac{1}{2}(E_{1}^{(0)}+E_{2}^{(0)}+H_{11}^{'}+H_{22}^{'})\pm \sqrt{\frac{1}{4}{{(E_{1}^{(0)}-E_{2}^{(0)}+H_{11}^{'}-H_{22}^{'})}^{2}}+{{\left| H_{12}^{'} \right|}^{2}}}
&lt;/math&gt;

This formula gives the required eigenvalues of the energy in the first approximation.

If the energy values of the two terms become equal at the point &lt;math&gt;({{R}_{C}}+\Delta R)
&lt;/math&gt; (i.e. the terms intersect), this means that the two values of &lt;math&gt;E
&lt;/math&gt; given by formula, are the same. For this to happen, the expression under the radical must vanish. Since it is the sum of two squares, both are simultaneously zero. So, it gives the conditions:

&lt;math&gt;E_{1}^{(0)}-E_{2}^{(0)}+H_{11}^{'}-H_{22}^{'}=0
&lt;/math&gt;

'''''and '''''

&lt;math&gt;H_{12}^{'}=0
&lt;/math&gt;

|}
However, we have at our disposal only one arbitrary parameter &lt;math&gt;\Delta R
&lt;/math&gt; giving the perturbation &lt;math&gt;H'
&lt;/math&gt;. Hence the

two conditions involving more than one parameter cannot in general be simultaneously satisfied (the initial assumption that &lt;math&gt;\left| \Phi _{1}^{(0)} \right\rangle
&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\left| \Phi _{2}^{(0)} \right\rangle
&lt;/math&gt; real, implies that &lt;math&gt;H_{12}^{'}
&lt;/math&gt; is also real). So, two case can arise:&amp;nbsp;
# The matrix element &lt;math&gt;H_{12}^{'}
&lt;/math&gt; vanishes identically. It is then possible to satisfy the first condition independently. Therefore, it is possible for the crossing to occur if, for a certain value of &lt;math&gt;\Delta R
&lt;/math&gt; (i.e., for a certain value of &lt;math&gt;R
&lt;/math&gt;) the first equation is satisfied. As the perturbation operator &lt;math&gt;H'
&lt;/math&gt; (or &lt;math&gt;H
&lt;/math&gt;) commutes with the symmetry operators of the molecule, this case will happen if the two electronic states &lt;math&gt;\left| \Phi _{1}^{(0)} \right\rangle
&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\left| \Phi _{2}^{(0)} \right\rangle
&lt;/math&gt;  have different point group symmetries (for example if they correspond to two electronic terms having different values of &lt;math&gt;\Lambda 
&lt;/math&gt;, different electronic parities '''''g''''' and '''''u''''', different multiplicities, or for example are the two terms &lt;math&gt;{{\Sigma }^{+}}
&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;{{\Sigma }^{-}}
&lt;/math&gt; ) as it can be shown that, for a scalar quantity whose operator commutes with the angular momentum and inversion operators, only the matrix elements for transitions between states of the same angular momentum and parity are non-zero and the proof remains valid, in essentially the same form, for the general case of an arbitrary symmetry operator. &amp;nbsp;
# If  the electronic states &lt;math&gt;\left| \Phi _{1}^{(0)} \right\rangle
&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\left| \Phi _{2}^{(0)} \right\rangle
&lt;/math&gt; have the same point group symmetry, then &lt;math&gt;H_{12}^{'}
&lt;/math&gt; can be, and will in general be, non-zero. Except for accidental crossing which would occur if, by coincidence, the two equations were satisfied at the same value of &lt;math&gt;R
&lt;/math&gt;, it is in general impossible to find a single value of &lt;math&gt;\Delta R
&lt;/math&gt; (i.e., a single value of &lt;math&gt;R
&lt;/math&gt;)  for which the two conditions are satisfied simultaneously. &amp;nbsp;
Thus, in a diatomic molecule, only terms of different symmetry can intersect, while the intersection of terms of like symmetry is forbidden. This is, in general, true for any case in quantum mechanics where the Hamiltonian contains some parameter and its eigenvalues are consequently functions of that parameter. This general rule is known as '''[[von Neumann]] - [[Wigner]] non-crossing rule. '''
{{#tag:ref| This follows from a more general rule of group theory. In the terminology of group theory, the general condition for the possible intersection of terms is that the terms should belong to different [[irreducible representations]] (irreps) of the symmetry group of the Hamiltonian of the system.&lt;ref name="Landau"&gt;{{Cite book

This general symmetry principle has important consequences is molecular spectra.
In fact, in the applications of [[Valence bond theory|valence bond method]] in case of diatomic molecules, three main correspondence between the [[Atomic orbital|atomic]] and the [[molecular orbitals]] are taken care of:
# Molecular orbitals having a given value of &lt;math&gt;\lambda &lt;/math&gt; (the component of the orbital angular momentum along the internuclear axis) must connect with atomic orbitals having the same value of &lt;math&gt;\lambda &lt;/math&gt; (i.e. the same value of &lt;math&gt;\left| m \right|&lt;/math&gt;).
# The electronic parity of the wave function (''g'' or ''u'') must be preserved as &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt; varies from &lt;math&gt;0&lt;/math&gt; to &lt;math&gt;\infty&lt;/math&gt;.
# The von Neumann-Wigner non-crossing rule must be obeyed, so that energy curves corresponding to orbitals having the same symmetry do not cross as &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt; varies from &lt;math&gt;0&lt;/math&gt; to &lt;math&gt;\infty&lt;/math&gt;.
Thus, von Neumann-Wigner non-crossing rule also acts as a starting point for valence bond theory.

== Observable consequences==
Symmetry in diatomic molecules manifests itself directly by influencing the molecular [[Spectral line|spectra]] of the molecule. The effect of symmetry on different types of spectra in diatomic molecules are:

=== [[Rotational spectrum]] ===
In the electric dipole approximation the transition amplitude for emission or absorption of radiation can be shown to be proportional to the vibronic matrix element of the component of the [[electric dipole]] operator &lt;math&gt;D&lt;/math&gt; along the molecular axis. This is the permanent electric dipole moment.
In homonuclear diatomic molecules, the permanent electric dipole moment vanishes and there is no pure rotation spectrum.
Heteronuclear diatomic molecules possess a permanent electric dipole moment and exhibit spectra corresponding to rotational transitions, without change in the vibronic state. For &lt;math&gt;\Lambda =0 &lt;/math&gt;, the selection rules for a rotational transition are: &lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
  &amp; \Delta \Im =\pm 1 \\ 
 &amp; \Delta {{M}_{\Im }}=0,\pm 1 \\ 
\end{align} &lt;/math&gt;. For &lt;math&gt;\Lambda \ne 0 &lt;/math&gt;, the selection rules become: &lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
  &amp; \Delta \Im =0,\pm 1 \\ 
 &amp; \Delta {{M}_{\Im }}=0,\pm 1 \\ 
\end{align} &lt;/math&gt;.This is due to the fact that although the photon absorbed or emitted carries one unit of angular momentum, the nuclear rotation can change, with no change in &lt;math&gt;\Im  &lt;/math&gt;, if the electronic angular momentum makes an equal and opposite change. Symmetry considerations require that the electric dipole moment of a diatomic molecule is directed along the internuclear line, and this leads to the additional selection rule &lt;math&gt;\Delta \Lambda =0 &lt;/math&gt;.The pure rotational spectrum of a diatomic molecule consists of lines in the far infra-red or the microwave region, the frequencies of these lines given by:

&lt;math&gt;\hbar {{\omega }_{\Im +1,\Im }}={{E}_{r}}(\Im +1)-{{E}_{r}}(\Im )=2B(\Im +1) &lt;/math&gt;; where &lt;math&gt;B=\frac{{{\hbar }^{2}}}{2\mu R_{0}^{2}} &lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;\Im \ge \Lambda  &lt;/math&gt;
* '''&lt;u&gt;N.B.&lt;/u&gt;''' In exceptional circumstances the hyperfine Hamiltonian can mix the rotational levels of '''''g''''' and '''''u''''' vibronic states of homonuclear diatomic molecules giving rise to pure rotational ('''''ortho''''' - '''''para''''') transitions in a homonuclear diatomic molecule.&lt;ref name=Critchley2001/&gt;

=== [[Vibrational spectrum]] ===
The transition matrix elements for pure vibrational transition are &lt;math&gt;{{\mu }_{v,v'}}=\left\langle v'|\mu |v \right\rangle  &lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;\mu 
 &lt;/math&gt; is the dipole moment of the diatomic molecule in the electronic state &lt;math&gt;\alpha &lt;/math&gt;. Because the dipole moment depends on the bond length &lt;math&gt;R &lt;/math&gt;, its variation with displacement of the nuclei from equilibrium can be expressed as: &lt;math&gt;\mu ={{\mu }_{0}}+{{(\frac{d\mu }{dx})}_{0}}x+\frac{1}{2}{{(\frac{{{d}^{2}}\mu }{d{{x}^{2}}})}_{0}}{{x}^{2}}+....... &lt;/math&gt;; where &lt;math&gt;{{\mu }_{0}} &lt;/math&gt; is the dipole moment when the displacement is zero. The transition matrix elements are, therefore: &lt;math&gt;\left\langle v'|\mu |v \right\rangle ={{\mu }_{0}}\left\langle v'|v \right\rangle +{{(\frac{d\mu }{dx})}_{0}}\left\langle v'|x|v \right\rangle +\frac{1}{2}{{(\frac{{{d}^{2}}\mu }{d{{x}^{2}}})}_{0}}\left\langle v'|{{x}^{2}}|v \right\rangle +.......={{(\frac{d\mu }{dx})}_{0}}\left\langle v'|x|v \right\rangle +\frac{1}{2}{{(\frac{{{d}^{2}}\mu }{d{{x}^{2}}})}_{0}}\left\langle v'|{{x}^{2}}|v \right\rangle +....... &lt;/math&gt;using orthogonality of the states. So, the transition matrix is non-zero only if the molecular dipole moment varies with displacement, for otherwise the derivatives of &lt;math&gt;\mu &lt;/math&gt; would be zero. The gross selection rule for the vibrational transitions of diatomic molecules is then: ''To show a vibrational spectrum, a diatomic molecule must have a dipole moment that varies with extension. So, ''homonuclear diatomic molecules do not undergo electric-dipole vibrational transitions. So, a homonuclear diatomic molecule doesn't show purely vibrational spectra.

For small displacements, the electric dipole moment of a molecule can be expected to vary linearly with the extension of the bond. This would be the case for a heteronuclear molecule in which the partial charges on the two atoms were independent of the internuclear distance. In such cases (known as harmonic approximation), the quadratic and higher terms in the expansion can be ignored and &lt;math&gt;{{\mu }_{v,v'}}=\left\langle v'|\mu |v \right\rangle ={{(\frac{d\mu }{dx})}_{0}}\left\langle v'|x|v \right\rangle  &lt;/math&gt;. Now, the matrix elements can be expressed in position basis in terms of the harmonic oscillator wavefunctions: Hermite polynomials. Using the property of Hermite polynomials: &lt;math&gt;2(\alpha x){{H}_{v}}(\alpha x)=2v{{H}_{v-1}}(\alpha x)+{{H}_{v+1}}(\alpha x) &lt;/math&gt;, it is evident that &lt;math&gt;x\left| v \right\rangle  &lt;/math&gt; which is proportional to &lt;math&gt;x{{H}_{v}}(\alpha x) &lt;/math&gt;, produces two terms, one proportional to &lt;math&gt;\left| v+1 \right\rangle  &lt;/math&gt; and the other to &lt;math&gt;\left| v-1 \right\rangle  &lt;/math&gt;. So, the only non-zero contributions to &lt;math&gt;{{\mu }_{v,v'}} &lt;/math&gt; comes from &lt;math&gt;v'=v\pm 1 &lt;/math&gt;. So, the selection rule for heteronuclear diatomic molecules is: &lt;math&gt;\Delta v=\pm 1 &lt;/math&gt;
* '''&lt;u&gt;Conclusion:&lt;/u&gt;''' Homonuclear diatomic molecules show no pure vibrational spectral lines, and the vibrational spectral lines of heteronuclear diatomic molecules are governed by the above-mentioned selection rule.

=== [[Rotational–vibrational spectroscopy|Rovibrational spectrum]] ===
{{main|Rotational–vibrational spectroscopy}}
Homonuclear diatomic molecules show neither pure vibrational nor pure rotational spectra. However, as the absorption of a [[photon]] requires the molecule to take up one unit of [[angular momentum]], vibrational transitions are accompanied by a change in rotational state, which is subject to the same selection rules as for the pure rotational spectrum. For a molecule in a &lt;math&gt;\Sigma &lt;/math&gt; state, the transitions between two vibration-rotation (or ''rovibrational'') levels &lt;math&gt;(v,\Im )&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;(v',\Im' )&lt;/math&gt;, with vibrational quantum numbers &lt;math&gt;v&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;v' = v + 1&lt;/math&gt;, fall into two sets according to whether &lt;math&gt;\Delta \Im =+1&lt;/math&gt; or  &lt;math&gt;\Delta \Im =-1&lt;/math&gt;. The set corresponding to &lt;math&gt;\Delta \Im =+1&lt;/math&gt; is called the '''''R branch'''''. The corresponding frequencies are given by: &lt;math&gt;\hbar {{\omega }^{R}}=E(v+1,\Im +1)-E(v,\Im )=2B(\Im +1)+\hbar {{\omega }_{0}};\text{ }\Im =0,1,2,......&lt;/math&gt;

The set corresponding to &lt;math&gt;\Delta \Im =-1&lt;/math&gt; is called the '''''P branch'''''. The corresponding frequencies are given by:  &lt;math&gt;\hbar {{\omega }^{P}}=E(v+1,\Im -1)-E(v,\Im )=-2B\Im +\hbar {{\omega }_{0}};\text{ }\Im =1,2,3,......&lt;/math&gt;

Both branches make up what is called a ''rotational-vibrational band or a rovibrational band''. These bands are in the [[infra-red]] part of the spectrum.

If the molecule is not in a &lt;math&gt;\Sigma &lt;/math&gt; state, so that &lt;math&gt;\Lambda \ne 0 &lt;/math&gt;, transitions with &lt;math&gt;\Delta \Im =0&lt;/math&gt; are allowed. This gives rise to a further branch of the vibrational-rotational spectrum, called the '''''Q branch'''''. The frequencies &lt;math&gt;{{\omega }^{Q}}&lt;/math&gt; corresponding to the lines in this branch are given by a quadratic function of &lt;math&gt;\Im 
&lt;/math&gt; if &lt;math&gt;{{B}_{v}}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;{{B}_{v+1}}&lt;/math&gt; are unequal, and reduce to the single frequency: &lt;math&gt;\hbar {{\omega }^{Q}}=E(v+1,\Im )-E(v,\Im )=\hbar {{\omega }_{0}}&lt;/math&gt; if &lt;math&gt;{{B}_{v+1}}={{B}_{v}}&lt;/math&gt;.

For a heteronuclear diatomic molecule, this selection rule has two consequences:  
# Both the vibrational and rotational quantum numbers must change. The Q-branch is therefore forbidden.
# The energy change of rotation can be either subtracted from or added to the energy change of vibration, giving the P- and R- branches of the spectrum, respectively.
Homonuclear diatomic molecules also show this kind of spectra. The selection rules, however, are a bit different.
* '''&lt;u&gt;Conclusion:&lt;/u&gt;''' Both homo- and hetero-nuclear diatomic molecules show rovibrational spectra. A Q-branch is absent in the spectra of heteronuclear diatomic molecules.

== A special example: Hydrogen molecule ion  ==
{{Main|Dihydrogen cation}}An explicit implication of symmetry on the molecular structure can be shown in case of the simplest bi-nuclear system: a hydrogen molecule ion or a di-hydrogen cation, &lt;math&gt;\text{H}_{2}^{+}&lt;/math&gt;. A natural trial wave function for the &lt;math&gt;\text{H}_{2}^{+}&lt;/math&gt; is determined by first considering the lowest-energy state of the system when the two protons are widely separated. Then there are clearly two possible states: the electron is attached either to one of the protons, forming a hydrogen atom in the [[ground state]], or the electron is attached to the other proton, again in the ground state of a hydrogen atom (as depicted in the picture). 
[[File:Two possible initial states of the system.png|thumb|484x484px|Two possible initial states of the system]]
The trial states in the position basis (or the '[[wave functions]]') are then:

&lt;math&gt;\left\langle \mathbf{r}|\mathbf{1} \right\rangle =\frac{1}{\sqrt{\pi a_{0}^{3}}}{{e}^{-\frac{\left| \mathbf{r}-\frac{\mathbf{R}}{2} \right|}{{{a}_{0}}}}}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\left\langle \mathbf{r}|\mathbf{2} \right\rangle =\frac{1}{\sqrt{\pi a_{0}^{3}}}{{e}^{-\frac{\left| \mathbf{r}+\frac{\mathbf{R}}{2} \right|}{{{a}_{0}}}}}&lt;/math&gt;

The analysis of &lt;math&gt;\text{H}_{2}^{+}&lt;/math&gt; using variational method starts assuming these forms. Again, this is only one possible combination of states. There can be other combination of states also, for example, the electron is in an excited state of the hydrogen atom. The corresponding Hamiltonian of the system is:

&lt;math&gt;H=\frac{{{\mathbf{p}}^{2}}}{2{{m}_{e}}}-\frac{{{e}^{2}}}{\left| \mathbf{r}-\mathbf{R}/2 \right|}-\frac{{{e}^{2}}}{\left| \mathbf{r}+\mathbf{R}/2 \right|}+\frac{{{e}^{2}}}{R}&lt;/math&gt;

Clearly, using the states &lt;math&gt;\left| 1 \right\rangle &lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\left| 2 \right\rangle &lt;/math&gt; as basis will introduce off-diagonal elements in the Hamiltonian. Here, because of the relative simplicity of the &lt;math&gt;\text{H}_{2}^{+}&lt;/math&gt; ion, the [[Matrix (mathematics)|matrix elements]] can actually be calculated. The electronic Hamiltonian of &lt;math&gt;\text{H}_{2}^{+}&lt;/math&gt; commutes with the  point group inversion symmetry operation '''''i'''''. Using its symmetry properties, we can relate the [[Diagonal matrix|diagonal]] and off-diagonal elements of the Hamiltonian as:
{| class="wikitable collapsible collapsed"
! &lt;math&gt;{{H}_{11}}={{H}_{22}}\text{ and }{{H}_{12}}={{H}_{21}}&lt;/math&gt;
|-
| The diagonal terms:
&lt;math&gt;{{H}_{11}}=\left\langle 1|\frac{{{\mathbf{p}}^{2}}}{2{{m}_{e}}}-\frac{{{e}^{2}}}{\left| \mathbf{r}-\mathbf{R}/2 \right|}|1 \right\rangle -\left\langle 1|\frac{{{e}^{2}}}{\left| \mathbf{r}+\mathbf{R}/2 \right|}|1 \right\rangle +\frac{{{e}^{2}}}{R}\left\langle 1|1 \right\rangle &lt;/math&gt;&lt;math&gt;\Rightarrow {{H}_{11}}={{E}_{1}}-\int{{{d}^{3}}r}\frac{{{e}^{2}}}{\left| \mathbf{r}+\mathbf{R}/2 \right|}{{\left| \left\langle \mathbf{r}|1 \right\rangle  \right|}^{2}}+\frac{{{e}^{2}}}{R}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;math&gt;\Rightarrow {{H}_{11}}={{E}_{1}}-\int{{{d}^{3}}r}\frac{{{e}^{2}}}{\left| \mathbf{r}+\mathbf{R}/2 \right|}{{\left| \left\langle \mathbf{r}|1 \right\rangle  \right|}^{2}}+\frac{{{e}^{2}}}{R}&lt;/math&gt;

Where, &lt;math&gt;{{E}_{1}} &lt;/math&gt;is the ground-state energy of the hydrogen atom.

Again,&lt;math&gt;{{H}_{22}}=\left\langle 2|\frac{{{\mathbf{p}}^{2}}}{2{{m}_{e}}}-\frac{{{e}^{2}}}{\left| \mathbf{r}+\mathbf{R}/2 \right|}|2 \right\rangle -\left\langle 2|\frac{{{e}^{2}}}{\left| \mathbf{r}-\mathbf{R}/2 \right|}|2 \right\rangle +\frac{{{e}^{2}}}{R}\left\langle 2|2 \right\rangle &lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;\Rightarrow {{H}_{22}}={{E}_{1}}-\int{{{d}^{3}}r}\frac{{{e}^{2}}}{\left| \mathbf{r}-\mathbf{R}/2 \right|}{{\left| \left\langle \mathbf{r}|2 \right\rangle  \right|}^{2}}+\frac{{{e}^{2}}}{R}={{H}_{11}}&lt;/math&gt;

where the last step follows from the fact that &lt;math&gt;{{\left| \left\langle \mathbf{r}|2 \right\rangle  \right|}^{2}}={{\left| \left\langle \mathbf{r}|1 \right\rangle  \right|}^{2}}=\frac{1}{\pi a_{0}^{3}}&lt;/math&gt; and from the symmetry of the system, the value of the integrals are same.

Now the off-diagonal terms:

&lt;math&gt;{{H}_{12}}=\left\langle 1|\frac{{{\mathbf{p}}^{2}}}{2{{m}_{e}}}-\frac{{{e}^{2}}}{\left| \mathbf{r}+\mathbf{R}/2 \right|}|2 \right\rangle -\left\langle 1|\frac{{{e}^{2}}}{\left| \mathbf{r}-\mathbf{R}/2 \right|}|2 \right\rangle +\frac{{{e}^{2}}}{R}\left\langle 1|2 \right\rangle &lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;\Rightarrow {{H}_{12}}=({{E}_{1}}+\frac{{{e}^{2}}}{R})\left\langle 1|2 \right\rangle -\int{{{d}^{3}}r}\frac{{{e}^{2}}}{\left| \mathbf{r}-\mathbf{R}/2 \right|}\left\langle 1\left| \mathbf{r} \right\rangle \left\langle  \mathbf{r} \right|2 \right\rangle &lt;/math&gt;

by inserting a complete set of states &lt;math&gt;\int{{{d}^{3}}r}\left| \mathbf{r} \right\rangle \left\langle  \mathbf{r} \right|&lt;/math&gt; in the last term. &lt;math&gt;\left\langle 1|2 \right\rangle =\int{{{d}^{3}}r}\left\langle 1\left| \mathbf{r} \right\rangle \left\langle  \mathbf{r} \right|2 \right\rangle &lt;/math&gt; is called the 'overlap integral'

And,

&lt;math&gt;{{H}_{21}}=\left\langle 2|\frac{{{\mathbf{p}}^{2}}}{2{{m}_{e}}}-\frac{{{e}^{2}}}{\left| \mathbf{r}-\mathbf{R}/2 \right|}|1 \right\rangle -\left\langle 2|\frac{{{e}^{2}}}{\left| \mathbf{r}+\mathbf{R}/2 \right|}|1 \right\rangle +\frac{{{e}^{2}}}{R}\left\langle 2|1 \right\rangle &lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;\Rightarrow {{H}_{21}}=({{E}_{1}}+\frac{{{e}^{2}}}{R})\left\langle 2|1 \right\rangle -\int{{{d}^{3}}r}\frac{{{e}^{2}}}{\left| \mathbf{r}+\mathbf{R}/2 \right|}\left\langle 2\left| \mathbf{r} \right\rangle \left\langle  \mathbf{r} \right|1 \right\rangle ={{H}_{12}}&lt;/math&gt; (as the wave functions are real)

So, &lt;math&gt;{{H}_{11}}={{H}_{22}}\text{ and }{{H}_{12}}={{H}_{21}}&lt;/math&gt;

|}
Because &lt;math&gt;{{H}_{11}}={{H}_{22}}&lt;/math&gt; as well as &lt;math&gt;{{H}_{12}}={{H}_{21}}&lt;/math&gt;, the linear combination of &lt;math&gt;\left| 1 \right\rangle &lt;/math&gt; and&lt;math&gt;\left| 2 \right\rangle &lt;/math&gt; that [[Diagonalized|diagonalizes]] the Hamiltonian is &lt;math&gt;\left| \pm  \right\rangle =\frac{1}{\sqrt{2\pm 2\left\langle 1|2 \right\rangle }}(\left| 1 \right\rangle \pm \left| 2 \right\rangle )&lt;/math&gt; (after normalization). Now as &lt;math&gt;[H,&lt;/math&gt;'''''i'''''&lt;math&gt;]=0&lt;/math&gt; for &lt;math&gt;\text{H}_{2}^{+}&lt;/math&gt;, the states &lt;math&gt;\left| \pm  \right\rangle&lt;/math&gt; are also eigenstates of '''''i'''''. It turns out that &lt;math&gt;\left| +  \right\rangle&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\left| -  \right\rangle&lt;/math&gt; are the eigenstates of '''''i''''' with eigenvalues +1 and -1 (in other words, the wave functions &lt;math&gt;\left\langle \mathbf{r}|+ \right\rangle &lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\left\langle \mathbf{r}|- \right\rangle &lt;/math&gt; are gerade (symmetric) and ungerade (unsymmetric), respectively). The corresponding expectation value of the energies are &lt;math&gt;{{E}_{\pm }}=\frac{1}{1\pm \left\langle 1|2 \right\rangle }({{H}_{11}}\pm {{H}_{12}})&lt;/math&gt;. [[File:H2plus figure 2.png|center|thumb|600x484px|The energy vs separation graphs of &lt;math&gt;\text{H}_{2}^{+}&lt;/math&gt;. The two lowest curves denote the &lt;math&gt;{{E}_{-}}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;{{E}_{+}}
&lt;/math&gt; states respectively. Higher ones are the excited states. The minimum of &lt;math&gt;{{E}_{+}}
&lt;/math&gt; corresponds to an energy &lt;math&gt;-15.4 \text{ eV}&lt;/math&gt;]]

From the graph, we see that only &lt;math&gt;{{E}_{+}}&lt;/math&gt; has a minimum corresponding to a separation of 1.3 &amp;Aring; and a total energy &lt;math&gt;{{E}_{+}}=-15.4 \text{ eV}&lt;/math&gt;, which is less than the initial energy of the system, &lt;math&gt;-13.6 \text{ eV}&lt;/math&gt;. Thus, only the gerade state stabilizes the ion with a [[binding energy]] of &lt;math&gt;1.8 \text{ eV}&lt;/math&gt;. As a result, the ground state of &lt;math&gt;\text{H}_{2}^{+}&lt;/math&gt; is &lt;math&gt;{{X}^{2}}\Sigma _{g}^{+}&lt;/math&gt; and this state &lt;math&gt;\left( \left| +  \right\rangle \right)&lt;/math&gt; is called a bonding molecular orbital.&lt;ref name="Townsend"&gt;{{Cite book

'''''The Accordionist''''' is a 1911 [[painting]] by [[Pablo Picasso]].  As stated by the title, the painting is meant to portray a man playing an [[accordion]].  The division of three-dimensional forms into a two-dimensional plane indicate that the painting is in the style of [[analytic cubism]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Voorhies|first=James|title=Pablo Picasso (1881-1973)|url=http://www.metmuseum.org/toah/hd/pica/hd_pica.htm|work=Heilbrunn Timeline of Art History|publisher=[[Metropolitan Museum of Art]] | year=2000 |accessdate=8 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; which was developed by Picasso and [[Georges Braque]] between 1907 and 1914.  The onset of cubism is possibly due to Picasso and Braque rebelling against centuries of traditional, realistic art that imitates the natural world.

In earlier stages of analytic cubism, such as Picasso's ''Carafe, Jug and Fruit Bowl'', Picasso begins to break up the subject matter and alter the sense of depth.  However, in earlier work there is still a defined sense of the subject's shape and volume.  The picture plane is distorted, but not to the same extent as later paintings such as ''The Accordionist'' which verge on complete abstraction.  Also differentiating early and late analytical cubism is the use of color.  In ''Carafe, Jug and Fruit Bowl'' Picasso uses color to define the table cloth, bowls, and fruit, allowing the viewer to easily discern the subject matter, despite the slight flattening and separation of the picture plane.  ''The Accordionist'' on the other hand is almost monochromatic which further camouflages the subject.

== The painting ==
''The Accordionist'' is 51.25&amp;nbsp;inches tall and 35.25&amp;nbsp;inches wide, painted in oil on canvas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Avgikos|first=Jan|title=Pablo Picasso|url=http://www.guggenheim.org/new-york/collections/collection-online/artwork/3426 |publisher=[[Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum|Guggenheim Museum]] |accessdate=27 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The composition consists of a multitude of geometric shapes of various sizes and content. The shapes most densely populate the middle of the painting, fanning out in a kind of triangle shape from the top to the bottom of the painting.  Since there is no obvious subject, this composition leads the viewer’s eye around the painting in an attempt to decipher the content.

Also focused toward the center of the painting are the dark colors, which aid in drawing the viewer in to explore the painting. Picasso utilized the drab, muted tones&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Rewald|first=Sabine|title=Cubism|url=http://www.metmuseum.org/toah/hd/cube/hd_cube.htm|work=Heilbrunn Timeline of Art History|publisher=Metropolitan Museum of Art|accessdate=8 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; in order to place the emphasis on the subject. Picasso’s dull palette also lends itself well to the piecing together of the different perspectives of the same subject.

== Interpretation ==
{{unreferenced section|date=April 2011}}
In the top middle portion of the painting there is a cluster of curvaceous shapes.  These shapes seem to form the face of the accordion player, which then leads down to the player’s body that expands out from neck to shoulders to the rest of the body.  Following the face down the painting, there is a large right angle that protrudes from the upper portion of the painting, which seems to be the player’s arm.  The arm is bent in such a manner that suggests the player is resting his arm on the arm of a chair and is sitting down.  Further suggesting that the player is seated is the round shape to the right of Picasso’s signature in the bottom left portion of the painting.  This shape looks as if it could represent the embellishment on the bottom of a chair leg.

The same kind of shape is seen on the right side of the painting and the spacing between the two encourages the viewer to see the shapes as legs to an armchair.  A little further up from the second chair leg one can see the beginnings of the accordion.  There is one fragment that has three small circles lined up in a vertical row next to what seems to be the last three fingers on a person’s hand. From the title, it can be assumed that this represents someone playing the accordion. Moving left from the hand and keys, there is a series of rectangular shapes, probably meant to depict the folds in an accordion.  The keys and folds around the player’s hand are shown from multiple viewpoints, which make it difficult to determine the exact direction of the accordion.

'''''The Circuit Rider''''' is a [[bronze sculpture]] by [[Alexander Phimister Proctor]], located in Capitol Park, east of the [[Oregon State Capitol]] in [[Salem, Oregon]], in the United States.&lt;ref name=SM&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.springfieldmuseum.com/robert-asbury-booth.html|title=City History by People: Robert Asbury Booth|publisher=The Springfield Museum|accessdate=March 17, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=OBB&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://sos.oregon.gov/blue-book/Pages/explore/exhibits/capitol.aspx|title=Capitol Tour Web Exhibit|accessdate=March 17, 2014|publisher=[[Oregon Blue Book]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Description and history==
According to the Springfield Museum, ''The Circuit Rider'' depicts "one of Oregon's pioneer [[circuit rider (religious)|circuit-riding]] Methodist ministers" and commemorates "the labors and achievements of the ministers of the Gospel, who as circuit riders became the friends, counselors and evengels to the pioneers on every American frontier."&lt;ref name=SM/&gt; The ''[[Oregon Blue Book]]'' says the [[equestrian statue]] is "symbolic of the many missionaries who came to Oregon".&lt;ref name=OBB/&gt;

The 3.5-ton statue was cast by [[Roman Bronze Works]] in New York and was gifted to the State of Oregon in 1924. It was presented "in reverent and grateful remembrance of Robert Booth, pioneer minister of the Oregon Country" by his son, Robert Asbury Booth, who was a prominent [[Eugene, Oregon|Eugene]] businessman and Oregon State Highway Commissioner.&lt;ref name=SM/&gt;&lt;ref name=Smithsonian&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://siris-artinventories.si.edu/ipac20/ipac.jsp?&amp;profile=all&amp;source=~!siartinventories&amp;uri=full=3100001~!310872~!0#focus|title=The Circuit Rider, (sculpture).|accessdate=March 17, 2014|publisher=[[Smithsonian Institution]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; The sculpture was originally sited at the west front of the old Capitol building and was relocated during construction of the new Capitol building (c. 1936–1937).&lt;ref name=Smithsonian/&gt; It fell off its pedestal during the [[Columbus Day Storm of 1962]] due to high winds.&lt;ref name=SM/&gt; In 1993, the statue was surveyed by the [[Smithsonian Institution]]'s [[Save Outdoor Sculpture!]] program, which concluded that "treatment [was] needed".&lt;ref name=Smithsonian/&gt;

'''''The Cremaster Cycle''''' is a series of five feature-length films, together with related sculptures, photographs, drawings, and artist's books, created by American visual artist and filmmaker [[Matthew Barney]].

''The Cremaster Cycle'' was made over a period of eight years (1994–2002) and culminated in a major museum exhibition organized by [[Nancy Spector]] of the [[Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum]] in New York City, which traveled to the [[Museum Ludwig]] in Cologne and the [[Musée d'Art Moderne de la Ville de Paris|Musée d'art Moderne]] in Paris from 2002-03. Barney's longtime collaborator Jonathan Bepler composed and arranged the soundtracks for the films.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.guggenheim.org/new-york/press-room/releases/press-release-archive/2002/664-april-9-matthew-barney-the-cremaster-cycle?tmpl=component&amp;print=1 Matthew Barney: The Cremaster Cycle]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview==

Guggenheim Museum curator [[Nancy Spector]] has described the ''Cremaster'' cycle (1994–2002) as "a self-enclosed aesthetic system."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.economist.com/node/1621742?story_id=E1_TGNTSQN ''Sex, life and video games; Matthew Barney.''] The Economist [US], 8 Mar. 2003.&lt;/ref&gt; The cycle includes the films as well as photographs, drawings, sculptures, and installations the artist produced in conjunction with each episode. Its conceptual departure point is the male [[cremaster muscle]], the primary function of which is to raise and lower the [[testes]] in response to temperature.

The project is filled with anatomical allusions to the position of the reproductive organs during the embryonic process of sexual differentiation: ''Cremaster 1'' represents the most "ascended" or undifferentiated state, ''Cremaster 5'' the most "descended" or differentiated.

The cycle repeatedly returns to those moments during early sexual development in which the outcome of the process is still unknown — in Barney's metaphoric universe, these moments represent a condition of pure potentiality. As the cycle evolved over eight years, Barney looked beyond [[biology]] as a way to explore the creation of form, employing narrative models from other realms, such as [[biography]], [[mythology]], and [[geology]].

== Numerical and thematic chronology ==
{| class="infobox" style="width:auto; text-align: center"
|-
| || || ||4|| ||1994

| colspan="6" | {{small|production order of the films,&lt;br /&gt;compared with numerical order}}
|}
While thematically the ''Cremaster'' films are chronological in the numbered order, they were not made or released in the same manner. The order in which they were made is as follows:
{| class="wikitable"
!'''Film'''
!Year
|-
|''Cremaster 4'' 
|1994
|-
|''Cremaster 1''
|1995
|-
|''Cremaster 5''
|1997
|-
|''Cremaster 2''
|1999
|-
|''Cremaster 3''
|2002
|}
The numerical order is the thematic order, while in order of production the films increased in production quality, ambition and scope, and they can alternatively be viewed in any order, as different views of a set of themes and preoccupations.

The films are significantly different in length; the longest (and last-made) is ''Cremaster 3'', at over 3 hours, while the remaining four are approximately an hour each, for a total of approximately 7 hours – #3 alone makes up almost half the total length of the cycle. Like Barney's other works, most of the films lack any particular dialogue with the exceptions being ''Cremaster 2''&lt;ref&gt;[http://cremasterfanatic.com/Synopsis2.html Cremaster 2 Synopsis]&lt;/ref&gt; and ''5,'' the latter of which is an opera sung in Hungarian.

An important precursor of ''The Cremaster Cycle'' is ''Drawing Restraint,'' which is also a biologically inspired multi-episode work in multiple media, also featuring the field emblem.

== Availability ==
The full series was released in a limited series of 20 sets of DVDs, sold each for at least $100,000, in custom packaging – as fine art, rather than mass-market movies.&lt;ref&gt;[http://cremasterfanatic.blogspot.com/2007/10/cremaster-2-on-sale-at-sothebys-new.html Cremaster 2 On Sale at Sotheby's New York], October 25, 2007&lt;/ref&gt; In 2007 one disc (''Cremaster 2'') sold for $571,000.&lt;ref&gt;[http://cremasterfanatic.blogspot.com/2007/11/cremaster-2-fetches-half-million.html Cremaster 2 Fetches Half a Million Dollars], November 16, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

The films are not available on mass-market DVDs, and according to the press release for the 2010 US tour, the cycle "is Not Now Nor Will it Ever be Available on DVD".&lt;ref name="us2010"&gt;[http://cremasterfanatic.blogspot.com/2010/03/cremaster-cycle-us-theatrical-release.html Cremaster Cycle U.S. Theatrical Release This Spring], Tuesday, March 30, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://chicagoartmagazine.com/2010/09/the-cremaster-cycle/ Epic masterwork is not now nor will it ever be available on DVD], Chicago Art Magazine&lt;/ref&gt; The films are primarily available via periodic screenings.&lt;ref name="faq"&gt;[http://cremasterfanatic.com/FAQs.html Cremaster Fanatic: FAQs]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cremaster.net/screens.htm Cremaster Screenings] – often years out of date&lt;/ref&gt; [[Palm Pictures]], the distributor, has continued to comply with Barney's request, and has not made the series available on DVD, though there were some rumors and announcements to this effect in 2003.&lt;ref&gt;[http://forum.dvdtalk.com/dvd-talk/316004-cremaster-cycle-1-5-palm-pictures-9-16-a.html DVD Talk CREMASTER CYCLE 1-5 from Palm Pictures 9/16???]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation| title = The Cremaster Cycle – Palm Pictures | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20030802091829/http://palmpictures.com/videos/thecremastercycle.html | archivedate = 2003-08-02 | url = http://www.palmpictures.com/videos/thecremastercycle.html | postscript =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; Only a 31-minute excerpt, the Guggenheim scene from Cremaster 3 entitled ''The Order'', was released on mass-market DVD in 2003.

==Reception==
Reaction to the cycle is sharply divided – some consider it a major work of art, on a par with ''[[Un Chien Andalou]]'' and ''[[The Waste Land]],''&lt;ref name="jones2002"&gt;{{Harv|Jones|2002}}&lt;/ref&gt; while others dismiss it as vapid, self-indulgent tedium.&lt;ref name="uhlich2010"&gt;{{Harv|Uhlich|2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is summarized by one critic as "Barney's cinematic art inspires both awe and revulsion, often simultaneously." Indeed, the ''[[Village Voice]]'' featured two reviews, with [[art critic]] [[Jerry Saltz]] praising the cycle, and film critic [[J. Hoberman]] panning it.

Lavish praise includes: "''The Cremaster Cycle'' by Matthew Barney is the first truly great piece of cinema to be made in a fine art context since Dali and Bunuel filmed ''Un Chien Andalou'' in 1929. It is one of the most imaginative and brilliant achievements in the history of avant-garde cinema."&lt;ref name="jones2002" /&gt; In 1999, when three of its entries (the fourth, first, and fifth) had been made, [[Michael Kimmelman]] of ''[[The New York Times]]'' hailed Barney as "the most important American artist of his generation."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1999/10/10/magazine/the-importance-of-matthew-barney.html |title=The Importance of Matthew Barney |last=Kimmelman |first=Michael |date=October 10, 1999 |accessdate=November 15, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has also, on the other hand, received scathing criticism as "a mostly tedious succession of striking but vacant imagery whose effect diminishes the longer you look at it," from which "any sense of mystery or wonder is drained."&lt;ref name="uhlich2010" /&gt;

The visuals are roundly praised, however, and some (Hoberman) feel that the movies work well as parts of installations, due to visuals, though not as movies, due to poor editing and pacing.

[[File:Памятник на могиле Неизвестного солдата Москва 0010 01.JPG|thumb|The [[Tomb of the Unknown Soldier (Moscow)|Tomb of the Unknown Soldier, Moscow]]]]
The '''Tomb of the Unknown Soldier''' refers to a monument dedicated to the services of an unknown soldier and to the common memories of all soldiers killed in any war. Such tombs can be found in many nations and are usually high-profile [[national monument]]s. Throughout history, many soldiers have died in war with their remains being unidentified. Following [[World War I]], a movement arose to commemorate these soldiers with a single [[tomb]], containing the body of one such unidentified soldier. It is a tomb for unknown people.

== History ==
=== France and the United Kingdom ===
During the First World War, the British and French armies who were allies during the war jointly decided to bury soldiers themselves. In the UK, under the Imperial War Graves Commission (now [[Commonwealth War Graves Commission]]), the Reverend [[David Railton]] had seen a grave marked by a rough cross while serving in the [[British Army]] as a [[Military chaplain|chaplain]] on the [[Western Front (World War I)|Western Front]], which bore the pencil-written legend "An Unknown British Soldier".&lt;ref name="Memorial"&gt;Henry Allingham, Dennis Goodwin (2011). "Kitchener's Last Volunteer:
The Life of Henry Allingham, the Oldest Surviving Veteran of the Great War". p. 132. Random House, 1976&lt;/ref&gt; He suggested (together with the French in their own country) the creation at a national level of a symbolic funeral and burial of an "Unknown Warrior", proposing that the grave should in the UK include a national monument in the form of what is usually, but not in this particular case, a headstone. The idea received the support of the [[Dean of Westminster]], Prime Minister [[David Lloyd George]], and later from King [[George V of the United Kingdom|George V]], responding to a wave of public support.&lt;ref name="Memorial" /&gt; At the same time, a similar concern grew in France. In November 1916, a local officer of [[Le Souvenir français]] proposed the idea of burying "an ignored soldier" in the [[Panthéon]]. A formal bill was presented in Parliament in November 1918. The decision was voted into law on September 1919.&lt;ref&gt;{{fr}} Jean-Yves Le Naour, ''Le soldat inconnu : la guerre, la mort, la mémoire'', Gallimard, 2008, p. 20&lt;/ref&gt;

The United Kingdom and France conducted services connected with their 'monumental' graves (as presumably newly conceived, and in any case approved, by their respective armies) on [[Armistice Day]] 1920 (the burial itself taking place later in January of the following year in France). In the UK, the [[Tomb of the Unknown Warrior]] was created at [[Westminster Abbey]], while in France ''[[Tomb of the Unknown Soldier (France)|La tombe du soldat inconnu]]'' was placed in the Arc de Triomphe.

=== Other countries ===
The idea of a symbolic Tomb of the Unknown Soldier then spread to other countries. In 1921, the [[United States]] unveiled its own [[Tomb of the Unknown Soldier (Arlington)|Tomb of the Unknown Soldier]], Portugal its [[Tomb of the Unknown Soldier (Portugal)|Túmulo do Soldado Desconhecido]], and Italy its [[Altare della Patria#Unknown soldier|La tomba del Milite Ignoto]]. Other nations have followed the practice and created their own tombs.

In Chile and Ukraine, second 'unknown tombs' were unveiled to commemorate ''The Unknown Sailor''.

== Symbolism ==
The Tombs of the Unknown Soldiers typically contain the remains of a dead soldier who is unidentified (or "known but to God" as the stone is sometimes inscribed).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Kwon |first=Heonik |title=Ghosts of War in Vietnam |year=2008 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |isbn=0-521-88061-0 |page=46}}&lt;/ref&gt; These remains are considered impossible to be identified, and so serve as a symbol for all of a country's unknown dead wherever they fell in the war being remembered. The anonymity of the entombed soldier is the key symbolism of the monument; it could be the tomb of anyone who fell in service of the nation, and therefore serves as a monument symbolizing all of the sacrifices.

== Examples ==
Tombs of the Unknown Soldiers from around the world and various wars include the following:

'''''Tracking the Chupacabra: The Vampire Beast in Fact, Fiction and Folklore''''' is a non-fiction book by [[Benjamin Radford]], an American writer and investigator. The book documents Radford's five-year investigation into accounts of the [[chupacabra]]. The chupacabra is said to be a vampiric predatory animal that drains the blood of animal victims while avoiding human detection.

==Overview==
The author, Benjamin Radford, attempts to solve the mystery of the [[chupacabra]], including whether it is a legend or real animal, what its physical and behavior characteristics are, its origin and connection to folklore, and what exactly is happening to the animals reported to be its victims.

''Tracking the Chupacabra'' documents Radford's five-year investigation, including his travels into the mysteries surrounding the chupacabra. It also includes his research, with interviews and documentation collected during this process.

Opening with "The Goatsucker Mystery," Radford introduced the essential portions of the [[chupacabra]] legend and its different versions, comparing the creatures' characteristics with another, [[Bigfoot]], which he writes is known for leaving large footprints. In his overview Radford summarized theories concerning the origin of the chupacabra, some paranormal or religious in nature, and interviewed several [[cryptozoology|cryptozoologists]].

In "A Brief history of Vampires," Radford wrote about common themes of vampire folklore. While exploring 18th-century accounts of European vampires, Radford notes that reports of vampire predation are used to explain otherwise unexplained misfortunes, such as disease, malnutrition, or loss of livestock. 

"Chupacabras in Popular Culture" described how, in Radford's view, the legend grew in Puerto Rico from observations by locals of apparent animal predations into rumors of a mysterious creature that was responsible. According to Radford, the news media leapt to conclusions, which, in his opinion, further drove alleged sightings and reports, to the extent that "any odd event"&lt;ref name="radford-2011"&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|41}} was attributed to the chupacabra.

The chapter "Searching for Chupacabras in Nicaragua" deals with Radford's investigation in [[Nicaragua]] near the [[San Juan River (Nicaragua)|Río San Juan]], where one of the best known alleged chupacabra remains had been discovered. While performing a physical search for the animal, Radford interviewed local experts, such as guide Fernando Casanova of Nicaragua's Indio Maiz Biological Reserve, about the local understanding of the chupacabra's "character or description," as well as examining tracks found in the area and comparing them to casts reportedly taken from scenes surrounding chupacabra victims.&lt;ref name="radford-2011" /&gt;{{rp|66–72}}

In "The Dead Vampires Speak: Chupacabra Carcasses," Radford discussed the analyses of various recovered corpses put forward as candidates for identification of the chupacabra animal. "The Curious Case of the Cuero Chupacabra" covers the analysis of a carcass of the American canid version of the chupacabra, discovered by a rancher in Cuero, Texas. The chapter also discusses Radford's participation in an episode of [[MonsterQuest#Season two .282008.29|MonsterQuest]], which aired in 2008 during the series' second season. Having analyzed the various forms of chupacabra remains and reports, in "Reconsidering the Goatsucker," Radford attempted to determine the origins of the chupacabra creature.

Radford concluded his investigation with the chapter "The Zoology of Chupacabras and the Science of Vampires." Compiling reports of researchers who examined victims of animal predation in apparent chupacabra attacks, Radford noted that the reports' claims that the animals had been [[Exsanguination|exsanguinated]] were inaccurate. The apparent loss of blood could be explained by internal hemorrhaging and pooling of blood at the bottom of the corpse. The attribution of the attacks on livestock to a vampiric entity can be explained by the puncture wounds resulting from the canine teeth left by most predators, who often instinctively go for the neck, according to taxidermist Jerry Ayer.&lt;ref name="radford-2011" /&gt;{{rp|165}} Radford attributes much of the spread of chupacabra sightings to factors including the mass media (especially the Internet and television shows), eyewitness misperceptions, ignorance of forensic science, social contagion, and mass hysteria,&lt;ref name="radford-2011" /&gt;{{rp|166}} and concludes that "every supposedly mysterious detail of the bloodsucking 'monster-thing' and its victims was explained."&lt;ref name="radford-2011" /&gt;{{rp|169}}

Matt Crowley, reviewing the book for ''[[The Skeptical Inquirer]]'' in July 2011, recapped Radford's process of tracing the origins of reported chupacabra sightings, tracking the changing physical attributes of the creature based on its description as reports journeyed from Puerto Rico eventually traveling to the United States.&lt;ref name="crowley-2011"&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; Crowley praised what he described as the "elegance" of Radford's investigation, stating that it "lies in the process of the proof, not just the result."&lt;ref name="crowley-2011" /&gt;

Reviewing ''Tracking the Chupacabra'' for ''[[Library Journal]]'', Janet Tapper described Radford as "thorough in his investigation; interviewing witnesses, providing creepy photographs of otherworldly creatures, serving up DNA analysis, and contemplating theories of [[Folie à deux|mass psychosis]]." Tapper recommended the work, stating "this objective probe will appeal to readers interested in exploring and exploding modern mysteries."&lt;ref name="tapper-2011"&gt;

Reviewing the book for the ''[[Journal of Folklore Research]]'', [[Memorial University of Newfoundland]]'s Virginia Fugarino stated that "to date, few books have been dedicated to taking a serious look at this creature," and commented on Radford's treatment of folklore, saying "he particularly explores how the chupacabra and other Latin American vampiric creatures can be seen to represent metaphorically postcolonial concerns and resentment of intrusion from outside political forces, specifically the U.S. government."&lt;ref name="fugarino-2011"&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; While criticizing Radford for what Fugarino states is an "at times [...] dismissive tone toward individuals who believe in the creature," she stated that the work was "clear and well presented."&lt;ref name="fugarino-2011" /&gt;

The [[American Folklore Society]] invited Radford to speak at its 2011 Annual Meeting, where he presented an abstract, "The Chupacabra and Folklore."&lt;ref name="american-folklore-society-2011a"&gt;

[[Cryptozoology|Cryptozoologist]] [[Karl Shuker]] performed a review of Radford's work in a March 2012 issue of ''[[Fortean Times]]'', stating that "the chupacabra has met its match," recommending the book's "scientific detachment and common sense" for readers looking for those traits.&lt;ref name="shuker-2012"&gt;

In a review for ''Aztlán'', an interdisciplinary journal of [[Chicano|Chicano studies]] published by the [[University of California, Los Angeles]], [[San Diego State University]]'s William A. Nericcio wrote that "the power of Radford's work is the depth of his research." Nericcio went on to discuss the impact of Radford's investigation on the dialogue regarding the cultural impact of the chupacabra in the Latin American community. According to Nericcio, "the rise of evangelical churches in Latin America and the American Southwest [...] coincides with sightings of the chupacabra and the virus-like spread of its mythology," referring to the perceived connection by some proponents between the chupacabra and satanic or occult phenomena.&lt;ref name="nericcio-2012"&gt;

A reviewer for ''The Latin Americanist'', the [[University of Oklahoma]]'s J. Justin Castro noted that chupacabra reports have "captured the imagination of people around the world," and praised Radford's "insightful and entertaining book," stating that "Radford sets the record straight, debunking many of the myths about the goatsucker." While Castro criticized some of Radford's arguments concerning feelings of U.S. exploitation of Puerto Rico as "largely unfounded," Castro stated that "His concluding arguments, on the other hand, are more viable. He makes a strong case that cinema greatly influenced the chupacabra phenomenon."&lt;ref name="castro-2012"&gt;

Tim Hull, in ''[[Tucson Weekly]]'', stated that "Radford's most interesting revelations are about the psychological and sociopolitical structures behind the folklore, especially as they relate to the monster's origins in Puerto Rico, where some people believe that the chupacabra is a secret U.S. government experiment gone wrong." Hull also went on to say that "While Radford's book—which is well-written and a fun read—should be the last word on the chupacabra's real-world existence, it won't be. As the author points out, the beast has entered the realm of conspiracy, where no amount of evidence, or logic, can sway the true believer."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Hull|first=Tim|title=Debunking Chupacabra: The managing editor of 'Skeptical Inquirer' says no to a mythical beast|url=http://www.tucsonweekly.com/tucson/debunking-chupacabra/Content?oid=2950786|work=Tucson Weekly|accessdate=18 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Jay Koester, in ''[[El Paso Times]]'', called Radford's book "[...] an enjoyable ride." Koester also went on to say that "The legend doesn't hold up well under Radford's scientific microscope, but the curious will still love this tour through the tall tales."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Koester|first=Jay|title=No monsters here: Investigator locates the chupacabra in legend only|url=http://www.elpasotimes.com/living/ci_18017017|work=El Paso Times|accessdate=18 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Rosanne Boyett, in the Cibola County Beacon, stated that "Radford questions documented reports and the resulting conclusions. But the author’s criticisms leave him vulnerable to accusations of racial prejudice, particularly the references to eyewitnesses’ reports."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Boyett|first=Rosanne|title=Tracking the Chupacabra|url=http://www.cibolabeacon.com/features/book-review/article_7ff87270-9303-544e-9372-ce24d5aa6416.html?mode=story|work=Cibola County Beacon|accessdate=18 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The staff at ''[[Fate (magazine)|Fate]]'' magazine stated that "[...] Tracking the Chupacabra is by no means another collection of witness accounts and unsubstantiated facts. The author has not only gone on an expedition to find the elusive beast (complete with all the expected disappointment) but has researched just about every reported Chupacabra encounter with the journalistic zeal of Woodward and Bernstein."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Tracking the Chupacabra: A fascinating book regarding the chupacabra in America|url=http://www.fatemag.com/inside-fate/book-reviews/tracking-the-chupacabra/|work=Fate Magazine|accessdate=18 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a review for [[The Skeptics Society]], [[Sharon A. Hill]] called the book "[...] satisfying for those willing to consider a legitimate, evidence-based explanation." Hill went on to say that "I’m hard pressed to find any stone unturned in this stunning exposé of the first Internet-age cryptid."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Hill|first=Sharon | authorlink=Sharon A.

[[Image:Sample ULAN term2.jpg|frame|Sample ULAN Record, [[Mark Rothko]] continued.]]
The '''Union List of Artist Names''' ('''ULAN''') is a free [[online database]] of the [[Getty Research Institute]] using a [[controlled vocabulary]], which by 2018 contained over 300,000 artists and over 720,000 names for them, as well as other information about artists.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.getty.edu/research/tools/vocabularies/ulan/faq.html ULAN FAQ]&lt;/ref&gt; Names in ULAN may include given names, pseudonyms, variant spellings, names in multiple languages, and names that have changed over time (e.g., married names). Among these names, one is flagged as the preferred name. 

Although it is displayed as a list, ULAN is structured as a [[Thesaurus (information retrieval)|thesaurus]], compliant with ISO and NISO standards for thesaurus construction; it contains hierarchical, equivalence, and associative relationships.

The focus of each ULAN record is an artist. In the database, each artist record (also called a subject) is identified by a unique numeric ID. The artist's nationality is given, as are places and dates of birth and death (if known).&lt;ref&gt;Lerner, Heidi G. (2008)."Resources for Jewish Biography and Autobiography on the Internet". ''Shofar'' '''26'''(2), 128–142.&lt;/ref&gt; Linked to each artist record are names, related artists, sources for the data, and notes. The temporal coverage of the ULAN ranges from Antiquity to the present and the scope is global.

Artists may be either individuals (persons) or groups of individuals working together (corporate bodies). Artists in the ULAN generally represent creators involved in the conception or production of visual arts and architecture. Some performance artists are included (but typically not actors, dancers, or other performing artists). Repositories and some donors are included as well.&lt;ref&gt; [http://www.getty.edu/research/conducting_research/vocabularies/ulan/about.html About ULAN] &lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Development of the ULAN began in 1984 by the J. Paul Getty Trust. The Trust, which already managed the [[Art and Architecture Thesaurus]] (AAT), began the project in response to requests from Getty projects for controlled vocabularies of artists' names.&lt;ref name="Harpring_2010"/&gt; The ULAN grows and changes via contributions from the user community and editorial work of the [[Getty Vocabulary Program]].&lt;ref name="Harpring_2010"&gt;Harpring, Patricia (2010). "Development of the Getty Vocabularies: AAT, TGN, ULAN, and CONA". ''Art Documentation: Journal of the Art Libraries Society of North America'' '''29'''(1), 67–72. &lt;/ref&gt;

Although originally intended only for use by Getty projects, the broader art information community outside the Getty expressed a need to use ULAN for cataloging and retrieval. The Getty thus distributed ULAN for broader use according to the tenets previously established for the construction and maintenance of the Art and Architecture Thesaurus: Its scope includes names needed to catalog and retrieve information about the visual arts and architecture; it is based on terminology that is current, warranted for use by authoritative literary sources, and validated by use in the scholarly art and architectural history community; and it is compiled and edited in response to the needs of the user community. Originally constructed as a simple alphabetized "union list" of clustered artist names and biographies, in order to make it consistent with the AAT and [[Getty Thesaurus of Geographic Names]], in the late 1990s ULAN was brought into compliance with national and international [[ISO 25964|standards for thesaurus construction]]. Its scope was broadened to include corporate bodies such as architectural firms and repositories of art, which may have hierarchical levels.

The ULAN was founded under the management of Eleanor Fink (head of what was then called the Vocabulary Coordination Group, and later Director of the Art History Information Program, later called the Getty Information Institute).&lt;ref name="Austin1995"&gt;Austin, David L. (1995). ''Art Documentation: Journal of the Art Libraries Society of North America'' '''14'''(2), 48–49. &lt;/ref&gt; The ULAN has been constructed over the years by numerous members of the user community and an army of dedicated editors, under the supervision of several managers. The ULAN was published in 1994 in hardcopy (Union List of Artist Names. Project manager, James M. Bower; senior editor, Murtha Baca. New York: G.K. Hall, 1994) and machine-readable files.&lt;ref name="Austin1995"/&gt; Given the growing size and frequency of changes and additions to the ULAN, by 1997 it had become evident that hard-copy publication was impractical. It is now published in automated formats only, in both a searchable online Web interface and in data files available for licensing. The data for ULAN is compiled and edited in an editorial system that was custom-built by Getty technical staff to meet the unique requirements of compiling data from many contributors, merging, moving, and publishing in various formats. Final editorial control of the ULAN is maintained by the Getty Vocabulary Program, using well-established editorial rules. The current managers of the ULAN are Patricia Harpring, Managing Editor, and Murtha Baca, Head, Vocabulary Program and Digital Resource Management.

==Design==
Even though the structure is relatively flat, the ULAN is constructed as a hierarchical database; its trees branch from a root called Top of the ULAN hierarchies (Subject_ID: 500000001); it currently has two published facets: Person and Corporate Body. Entities in the Person facet typically have no children. Entities in the Corporate Body facet may branch into trees. There may be multiple broader contexts, making the ULAN structure polyhierarchical. In addition to the hierarchical relationships, the ULAN also has equivalent and associative relationships.

[[File:Harrington Meeting House exterior.JPG|thumb|right|Participants of a VAF organized building tour approach the [[Harrington Meeting House]]]]
The '''Vernacular Architecture Forum (VAF)''' is a scholarly organization founded in 1980 to support the study and preservation of all aspects of [[vernacular architecture|vernacular architecture and landscapes]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.vernaculararchitectureforum.org/about/index.html&lt;/ref&gt;  The organization has brought together scholars and practitioners from a wide variety of disciplines--[[geography]], [[folklore]], [[architecture]], [[landscape architecture]], [[historic preservation]] and others.  The Vernacular Architecture Forum holds an annual meeting, conducts tours, and publishes the quarterly ''Vernacular Architecture Newsletter'' and the annual journal ''Buildings &amp; Landscapes: Journal of the Vernacular Architecture Forum''.  In 2007, VAF had more than 800 members.

The annual journal of VAF was initiated in 1982 as a series of books titled ''Perspectives in Vernacular Architecture'' that contained selected papers from the VAF annual meetings.  In 2007, the publication was retitled ''Buildings &amp; Landscapes: Journal of the Vernacular Architecture Forum'' reflecting its current formatting as a scholarly journal publishing a wide range of vernacular research.

The VAF expanded publication of special interest topics in the field of vernacular architecture and landscapes beginning with ''Invitation to Vernacular Architecture: A Guide to the Study of Ordinary Buildings and Landscapes''.&lt;ref&gt;Carter, Thomas, and Elizabeth C. Cromley. ''Invitation to vernacular architecture: a guide to the study of ordinary buildings and landscapes''. Knoxville: University of Tennessee Press, 2005. xi. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Visual markers of marital status''', as well as [[social]] status, may include [[clothing]], [[hairstyle]], accessories, [[jewelry]], [[tattoo]]s and other bodily adornments. Visual markers of [[marital status]] are particularly important because they indicate that a person should not be approached for [[flirt]]ation, [[courtship]], or [[sex]]. In some cultures, married people enjoy special privileges or are addressed differently by members of the community.

Marital status markers are usually [[gender]]-specific.

==Husband==
Male marital status markers are usually less elaborate than female marital status markers. In  many cultures they may not exist.

===Jewelery===
In many Western nations, some husbands wear a [[wedding ring]] on the third or fourth finger of the left hand. In parts of [[Europe]], especially in German-speaking regions, as well as in [[Bulgaria]], [[Cyprus]], [[Denmark]], [[Greece]], [[Latvia]], [[Lithuania]], [[Republic of Macedonia|Macedonia]], [[Norway]], [[Poland]], [[Russia]], [[Serbia]], [[Spain]], [[Turkey]], and [[Ukraine]], the wedding ring is worn on the ring finger of the right hand. In the [[Netherlands]], [[Catholic Church|Catholics]] wear their wedding rings on the left hand, while most other people wear them on the right. Some spouses choose to wear their wedding ring on the left hand in [[Turkey]].

In [[China]], Western influence has resulted in some husbands donning wedding rings. Traditionally, Chinese men did not wear rings and were expected to have several [[concubine|concubines]]. A ring symbolizing marriage to only one spouse was not considered necessary.&lt;ref name="f_100620"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://english.peopledaily.com.cn/90782/8017081.html|title=Chinese men find wedding rings cumbersome?|author=F_100620|publisher=|accessdate=26 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Modernly the material of wedding rings is not strictly prescribed; they may be forged of [[gold]], [[rose gold]], [[white gold]], [[sterling silver|argentium silver]], [[palladium]], [[platinum]], [[titanium]], or [[tungsten carbide]].

Manual labourers sometimes wear rings of inexpensive or more durable materials like [[tungsten]] while working or bear an ink [[tattoo]] to avoid damaging a ring of precious metal or personal injury.

===Beard===
Among the [[Amish]], [[Castellani (people)|Castellani]], and [[Hutterite]] communities of [[Canada]] and the [[United States]], only [[married]] [[men]] are permitted to wear a [[beard]]. Unmarried men are required to [[shaving|shave]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last = Kraybill| first = Donald| title = The Riddle of Amish Culture| publisher = Johns Hopkins University Press| year = 2001| isbn =0-8018-6772-X| page =68}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last = Hostetler| first = John| title = Hutterite Society| publisher = The Johns Hopkins University Press| year = 1997| isbn =0-8018-5639-6| page =174}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Tallit===
In some [[Ashkenazi]] [[Jewish]] communities, men wear a prayer shawl, denominated a "[[tallit]]" or "tallis", only upon marriage. It is customary for the father of the bride to present the groom with a [[tallit]] as a wedding present. In other Jewish communities, both Ashkenazic and Sephardic, all males wear the tallis, but only husbands wear it over their heads.

==Wife==

===Jewellery===
* [[Engagement ring]]: In many Western cultures, a proposal of marriage is traditionally accompanied by the gift of a ring. The man proposes and offers the ring; if the woman accepts this proposal of marriage, she will wear the ring, showing she is no longer available for courtship. In British-American tradition,  [[diamond]] rings are the most popular type of engagement ring. The engagement ring is usually worn on the left ring finger (sometimes this ring is switched from [[Ring finger#Left or right hand|the right to the left hand]] as part of the wedding ceremony). 
* [[Wedding ring]]: Many Western wedding ceremonies include the exchange of a wedding ring or rings. A common custom is for the groom to place a ring on the bride's finger and say, "With this ring I thee wed." Sometimes both bride and groom present each other with rings and repeat either these or similar words.  After the ceremony, the rings are worn throughout the marriage. In the event of divorce, the couple usually removes their rings; but some widows continue to wear their wedding ring, sometimes switching it to the left hand, while others do not. In Jewish tradition, the wedding ring must be a plain band, without gemstones. China has acquired the custom of wedding rings as late as the era of post-Cultural Revolution economic reforms, when rings were affordable and Western influence was allowed in.&lt;ref name="xinhuanet.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.xinhuanet.com/english2010/culture/2010-02/11/c_13171976.htm|title=Sealed with ring at Chinese weddings|publisher=|accessdate=26 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; As an adopted habit, there are variations on how rings are used, if at all, and when. Some women wear the wedding ring on the left hand, men on the right (representing [[yin and yang]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://leonmege.com/index.php/rules-of-engagement/resources/right-or-left|title=Right Hand or Left Hand?|publisher=|accessdate=26 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some men wear the ring on the right hand.&lt;ref name="xinhuanet.com"/&gt; {{Clarify|date=June 2015}} Many Chinese put the ring away to protect it, except for important holidays, such as anniversaries.&lt;ref name="xinhuanet.com"/&gt; In Chinese tradition, higher status for men was signified by having several young female partners or concubines. A ring denies that status. For this reason, many modern Chinese men do not wear a wedding ring. Diamonds and two-partner wedding rings are advertised in modern China.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.nipic.com/show/4/79/7f01e48287204bfa.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nipic.com/show/4/137/5532495kc0b81af3.html|title=珠宝钻石广告源文件__海报设计_广告设计_源文件图库_昵图网nipic.com|publisher=|accessdate=26 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Japanese, despite American occupation in the 1950s, only acquired a culture for wedding and engagement rings in the 1960s. In 1959, the importing of diamonds was allowed. In 1967 a U.S. advertising agency created a marketing campaign on behalf of the De Beers diamonds. The campaign equated rings with other symbols of Western culture. The campaign resulted in a sharp increase in demand: From 5% in 1967, to 27% in 1972, to 50% in 1978, to 60% in 1980.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.edwardjayepstein.com/diamond.htm|title=Diamonds, De Beers, CSO|publisher=|accessdate=26 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Mangalsutra]]: In many Hindu wedding ceremonies, the groom gives the bride a gold pendant or necklace incorporating black beads or black string. This is called a "mangal-sutra". It not only proclaims a woman's marriage, but it is believed by many to exercise a protective influence over the husband. That is, a wife's love and concern, as shown by her donning of the mangal-sutra, is magically helpful to the husband. This resembles the [[karwa-chauth]] celebration, in which a wife fasts and prays for her husband's welfare.
* [[Bangle|Bangles]]: [[Hindu]] wives also wear bangles of either white ("sankha") and/or red colour ("pala") on both hands, and do not remove them until they are single. Often made of glass, they are broken when the marriage ends. [[Bollywood]] uses this to great dramatic effect in [[Hindi]] films, with a woman being informed of the demise of her husband by the messenger, often her son, smashing her glass bangles and wiping the [[sindoor]] off her forehead. Bangles made of gold, silver, or other materials are also worn by middle class wives. {{Citation needed|date=November 2007}}

The concept of mourning jewelry, which is colored black, is becoming an accepted, visible custom for widows and widowers.{{Citation needed|date=November 2011}} Usually a black wedding band is worn on the third finger of the left hand. Usually the ring is a black wedding band, but black eternity bands and black solitaires are also worn. Such jewelry is denominated a "widow's ring" and the mourning ring is added to the marriage ring(s) and worn for the duration of the mourning period.{{Citation needed|date=November 2011}}

===Headwear===
In [[Judaism|Jewish]] tradition, a wife is expected to cover her head when she enters a synagogue. In [[Orthodox Judaism|Orthodox Jewish]] communities, women wear head coverings at all times outside of her home, but they sometimes only cover part of her hair, similar to a hat. In some [[Hasidic]] communities, women shave their heads after their weddings and wear close fitting black scarves. The kind of head covering may be determined by local custom or personal preference. Some communities permit her hair to be visible, but in others no strand is left uncovered. Hats, headscarves, snoods, wigs, or a combination thereof are used. [[Turkmens|Turkmen]] wives wear a special hat similar to a circlet that is denominated a "Alyndaňy".

===Hairstyle===
* [[Hairstyle#Marital status|Hairstyle indicating marital status]]
* [[Zuni people|Zuni]] hair styles

===Cosmetics===
* [[Sindoor]], a red powder (vermilion), is put on [[Hindu]] wives' foreheads to indicate their marital status.

===Clothes===
* [[Hindu]] widows wear white. (See [[White clothing (religious)]])
* Tibetan wives wear aprons.
* In western and northern [[Europe]], it was previously common for widows to wear black, at least until the first anniversary of the death of their husbands, and some still practice this custom.{{when|date=December 2015}}

'''''Wayne's World 2''''' is a 1993 American [[comedy film]] starring [[Mike Myers]] and [[Dana Carvey]] as hosts of a [[public-access television]] [[cable television]] show in [[Aurora, Illinois]]. The film is the sequel to ''[[Wayne's World (film)|Wayne's World]]'' (1992), which was adapted from a [[Wayne's World|sketch]] on [[NBC]]'s ''[[Saturday Night Live]]''.

==Plot==
[[Rock and roll]] fans Wayne Campbell and Garth Algar now host their [[public-access television]] show, ''Wayne's World,'' from an abandoned factory in [[Aurora, Illinois]]. After an [[Aerosmith]] concert, Wayne has a dream in which he meets [[Jim Morrison]] and a "weird naked [[Native Americans in the United States|Indian]]" in a desert. Morrison convinces Wayne that his destiny is to organize a major music festival. Wayne and Garth dub the concert "Waynestock" and hire Morrison's former roadie, Del Preston. Their early attempts to sign bands and sell tickets fail, and Wayne wonders if the endeavor is futile.

Wayne's girlfriend Cassandra, singer of the band Crucial Taunt, has a new producer, Bobby Cahn, who tries to pull her away from Wayne and Illinois. Garth meets a beautiful woman, Honey Hornée. After Wayne admits spying on her due to his suspicion of Bobby's ulterior motives, Cassandra breaks up with him and becomes engaged to Bobby. Honey Hornée attempts to manipulate Garth into killing her ex-husband, but Garth ends the relationship.

Tickets are sold for Waynestock but no bands arrive. Leaving Garth to keep the rowdy crowd in check, Wayne disrupts Cassandra's wedding before escaping the ceremony with her and they get back together, in a scene closely resembling the finale of ''[[The Graduate]]''. Meanwhile, Garth has [[stage fright]] during the concert. Wayne returns to find the bands have still not arrived.

In the dream desert, Wayne and Garth consult Morrison, who says that the bands will not come and that all that matters is they tried. They become lost in the desert. Finding this unacceptable, Wayne and Garth reenact the ending of ''[[Thelma &amp; Louise]]'', driving their car off a cliff while trying to find the bands. Finally, Wayne and Garth stage an ending in which the bands arrive and Waynestock is a success. Bobby arrives to Waynestock to get Cassandra but is not allowed inside.

After the concert, the park is covered with trash and [[Keep America Beautiful|the "weird naked Indian" cries]]. Wayne and Garth begin to remove the litter, promising to clean the entire park.

==Production==
[[Penelope Spheeris]], who directed the [[Wayne's World (film)|first film]] believes that Myers encouraged the studio not to have her back for the sequel due to personality conflicts with Myers during the making of the first film.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Rottenberg |first=Josh |date=June 16, 2008 |title=Mike Myers: Man of Mystery |publisher=ew.com |url=http://ew.com/article/2008/06/16/mike-myers-man-mystery/ |accessdate=May 26, 2017 |quote="I hated that bastard for years," says Spheeris, who believes Myers dissuaded Paramount from hiring her for Wayne's World 2. "But when I saw Austin Powers, I went, 'I forgive you, Mike.'" She pauses, voice choked with emotion. "'You can be moody, you can be a jerk, you can be things that others of us can't be—because you are profoundly talented. And I forgive you.'"}}&lt;/ref&gt; She went on to direct another TV to big screen adaptation, ''[[The Beverly Hillbillies (film)|The Beverly Hillbillies]]'' instead and was replaced by Stephen Surjik for the sequel.

Myers' original script for ''Wayne's World 2'' had Wayne and Garth forming their own country and seceding from the US after finding an ancient scroll, in a story taken from the 1949 British comedy ''[[Passport to Pimlico]].''  This version was well into pre-production before it came to light that the studio had no idea the script was based on a previous film and thus had not obtained the rights to ''Passport to Pimlico''.  Production was immediately halted—director Surjik said: "I could hear the chainsaws literally chopping the sets down."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Melnychuk |first=Mark |date=March 3, 2017 |title=Making Wayne's World 2 was 'traumatic' for director Stephen Surjik |publisher=[[Regina Leader-Post]] |url=http://leaderpost.com/news/local-news/making-waynes-world-2-was-traumatic-for-director-stephen-surjik |accessdate=May 26, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Studio executive [[Sherry Lansing]] was reportedly furious with Myers and threatened to ruin his life and career if he didn't immediately produce a new script.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=THR Staff |date=April 21, 2017 |title=Why Sherry Lansing Threatened Mike Myers: 'I'll Take Your F—ing House' |work=[[The Hollywood Reporter]] |url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/why-sherry-lansing-threatened-mike-myers-ill-take-your-f-king-house-994864 |accessdate=May 26, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception==
''Wayne's World 2'' received mixed reviews.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title= Wayne's World 2': It's Not as Good, but Still Worthy |newspaper=[[Los Angeles Times]] |date=September 11, 1992 |url= http://articles.latimes.com/1992-09-11/news/mn-255_1_wayne-s-world |first=Rone |last=Tempest |accessdate=February 27, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; On [[Rotten Tomatoes]], the film has a 61% approval rating, based on 44 reviews, with an average rating of 5.8/10. The website's critical consensus reads, "The characters are still endearing, but the jokes in ''Wayne's World 2'' are more hit-and-miss the second time around".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/waynes_world_2/ |title=Wayne's World 2 (1993) |work=[[Rotten Tomatoes]] |publisher=[[Fandango Media]] |accessdate=April 13, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Film critic [[Roger Ebert]] of the ''[[Chicago Sun-Times]]'' gave the film three out of four stars, and wrote that Wayne and Garth are "impossible to dislike".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |date=December 10, 1993 |first=Roger |last=Ebert |url= https://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/waynes-world-2-1993 |work=RogerEbert.com |publisher=Ebert Digital LLC |title=Wayne's World 2 |accessdate=February 27, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Box office ===
Although it was intended to be a [[Christmas season]] blockbuster, ''Wayne's World 2'' did not receive the box office intake or positive fan reaction that the first film did. Its final North American gross was $48 million, slightly more than its $40 million production budget, but much less than the original film's gross of over $100 million. ''Wayne's World 2'' also suffered from competition from other holiday season [[blockbuster (entertainment)|blockbuster]]s such as ''[[Mrs. Doubtfire]]'', ''[[Schindler's List]]'', and ''[[The Pelican Brief (film)|The Pelican Brief]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title= Wayne, Garth Party On at the Box Office Movies: 'Wayne's World' sequel pulls in an estimated $14.2 million to push "Mrs. Doubtfire" into second place.
