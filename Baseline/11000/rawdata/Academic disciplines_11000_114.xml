'''ADS-AC''' is an experimental [[open-source model|open source]] program which implements Absolutely Dynamic System, a proposed mechanism for [[Artificial consciousness|AC]].

==Theory==
ADS-AC uses a system of "points" or "nodes" connected by "links" to create a structure of "knots". The nodes have no properties other than their links to other nodes in order to maintain their absolute dynamicity.

'''''A General View of Positivism''''' (''Discours sur l'ensemble du positivisme'') was an 1848 book by the French philosopher [[Auguste Comte]], first published in English in 1865. A founding text in the development of [[positivism]] and the discipline of [[sociology]], the work provides a revised and full account of the theory Comte presented earlier in his multi-part ''[[The Course in Positive Philosophy]]'' (1830–1842). Comte outlines the epistemological view of positivism, provides an account of the manner by which sociology should be performed, and describes his [[law of three stages]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="18881">'''Anthracology''' (from ''anthrax'' (ἄνθραξ), the [[Greek language|Greek]] word for coal) is a multidisciplinary science that relies on the analysis and identification of [[charcoal]] based on wood anatomy, which remains perfectly preserved after [[carbonization]]. Remains of carbonized wood may come from archaeological sites or from sediments, and make evidence either of natural or anthropogenic paleofires or of several aspects of human activity. Anthracological studies may also be applied to extant material, in which case they can focus either on the anatomical description of reference material or on the inspection of charcoal of illegal provenience.

The identification of species from carbonized wood is actually a very old practice dating from the end of the 19th century, but the working methods back then (based on the preparation of thin sections) were extremely difficult and time-consuming, and researches still did not have any palaeoenvironmental approach. From the 1970s on, the use of reflected light microscopes, mainly diffused from France by Professor Jean-Louis Vernet, allowed the multiplication of anthracological analysis, propitiating the appearance of paleoecological studies. This discipline started and is being developed in Brazil by Rita Scheel-Ybert from around the late 1990s.

Anthracology is a privileged study method for archaeology. Archaeological sediments are usually very rich in charcoal fragments, which identification provides interpretations on the landscape, paleovegetation, relations between humans and their environment, and plants use by ancient populations. Besides the paleoenvironmental perspective that allows the reconstitution of past plant formations and, therefore, of the [[paleoclimate]], this discipline offers important palaeoethnobotanical information regarding the utilization of wood in everyday basis and also in rituals, including also the subsistence of ancient populations, by means of conservation of carbonized dietary remains.

The anthracological analysis of archaeological charcoal is already largely acknowledged as a reliable tool for palaeoenvironmental reconstruction. The development of this discipline, in Brazil, has been marked by a strong preoccupation with the definition of appropriate methodologies, seeking both palaeoenvironmental and palaeoethnobotanical information that are committed to archaeological issues.

Anthracological analyses in sambaquis and Tupiguarani sites on Southern and Southeastern Brazil, as well as in ceramic sites in Central Amazon, have been essential to broaden our knowledge about the landscape in the areas where such settlements were established, the environmental resources, site catchment area, fuel economy, and use of wood in quotidian and ritual contexts. More recently, anthracological analysis has proven itself an important tool to support archaeological interpretation, helping to elucidate site formation processes and providing more consistent information on the sites functional aspects.

Besides that, the conservation of carbonized fruits, seeds, and underground organs remains (roots and tubers) have enabled the approaching of diet and food production issues.

==Anthracology and dendrology==

[[Dendrology]] studies associated to anthracological analyses make possible to estimate the minimum diameter of charred woods on the basis of the angulation of the rays. The first studies on this research line took place on the [[Black Forest]], in Germany, where it was possible to recognize the effect of anthropical activities on the forest structure and composition (Ludemann, 2002, 2008; Ludemann &amp; Nelle, 2002; Ludemann et al., 2004; Nelle, 2002).

==Geoanthracology==

The study of charcoal of sedimentary origin   (soils, paleosoils or sedimentary deposit) provides essentially palaeoenvironmental information, allowing the reconstitution of previous vegetation and palaeoclimate. Important information on the relations between past vegetation, forest fires, and climate changes are being obtained from several studies performed in Europe and North America.

In Brazil, anthracological analyses coupled with the study of the isotopic composition of the soil at the State of São Paulo made possible to establish that the climate of that region was drier during the beginning of the Holocene and moister right after that period, as it is nowadays, from ca 3000 years BP (Scheel-Ybert et al., 2003).

==Legal control of charcoal production==

Anthracological studies may also be used for conservationist and technological approaches, as in detecting species of illegal provenience and determining charcoal quality. The use of Anthracology in Brazil as a tool to identify and, therefore, inspect and control charcoal production has important conservationist character since the country is the world’s main charcoal producer. Although such charcoal (which is mainly destined to the steel industry) may be regarded as clean energy, its environmental impact is actually strong, since a huge part of it is the result of illegal extraction from native forests.

'''Antinutrients''' are natural or synthetic compounds that interfere with the absorption of [[nutrient]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=XpUjsqD7lFUC&amp;pg=PA47|title=Oxford dictionary of biochemistry and molecular biology|last=|first=|date=2006|publisher=Oxford University Press|others=Cammack, Richard|year=|isbn=9780198529170|edition=Rev.|location=Oxford|pages=47|chapter=Aa|doi=10.1093/acref/9780198529170.001.0001|oclc=65467611|chapter-url=http://www.oxfordreference.com/view/10.1093/acref/9780198529170.001.0001/acref-9780198529170-e-1324?rskey=PPEnbe&amp;result=1261}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nutrition studies focus on these antinutrients commonly found in food sources and beverages.

== Examples ==
[[Phytic acid]] has a strong binding affinity to [[Mineral (nutrient)|minerals]] such as [[calcium]], [[magnesium]], [[iron]], [[copper]], and [[zinc]]. This results in precipitation, making the minerals unavailable for absorption in the [[Gastrointestinal tract|intestines]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | first1 = Päivi | last1 = Ekholm | first2 = Liisa | last2 = Virkki | first3 = Maija | last3 = Ylinen | first4 = Liisa | last4 = Johansson | name-list-format = vanc |title=The effect of phytic acid and some natural chelating agents on the solubility of mineral elements in oat bran |journal=Food Chemistry |date=Feb 2003 |volume=80 |issue=2 |pages=165–70 |doi=10.1016/S0308-8146(02)00249-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Cheryan M | title = Phytic acid interactions in food systems | journal = Critical Reviews in Food Science and Nutrition | volume = 13 | issue = 4 | pages = 297–335 | year = 1980 | pmid = 7002470 | doi = 10.1080/10408398009527293 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Phytic acids are common in the hulls of nuts, seeds and grains and of great importance in [[agriculture]] animal nutrition and [[eutrophication]] wise due to the mineral [[chelation]] and bound [[phosphate]]s released in to the environment. Without the need to use phytate (but also nutrient) reducing [[Mill (grinding)|milling]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Bohn L, Meyer AS, Rasmussen SK | title = Phytate: impact on environment and human nutrition. A challenge for molecular breeding | journal = Journal of Zhejiang University. Science. B | volume = 9 | issue = 3 | pages = 165–91 | date = March 2008 | pmid = 18357620 | pmc = 2266880 | doi = 10.1631/jzus.B0710640 }}&lt;/ref&gt; the amount of phytic acid is commonly reduced in [[animal feed]]s by adding [[Phytase#Histidine acid phosphatases (HAPs)|histidine acid phosphate]] type of [[phytase]]s to them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Kumar V, Singh G, Verma AK, Agrawal S | title = In silico characterization of histidine Acid phytase sequences | journal = Enzyme Research | volume = 2012 | pages = 845465 | date = 2012 | pmid = 23304454 | pmc = 3523131 | doi = 10.1155/2012/845465 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Protease]] [[enzyme inhibitor|inhibitors]] are substances that inhibit the actions of [[trypsin]], [[pepsin]] and other proteases in the gut, preventing the digestion and subsequent absorption of protein. For example, [[Bowman–Birk protease inhibitor|Bowman–Birk trypsin inhibitor]] is found in soybeans.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | first1 = Anna L. | last1 = Tan-Wilson | first2 = Jean C. | last2 = Chen | first3 = Michele C. | last3 = Duggan | first4 = Cathy | last4 = Chapman | first5 = R. Scott | last5 = Obach | first6 = Karl A. | last6 = Wilson | name-list-format = vanc |title=Soybean Bowman-Birk trypsin isoinhibitors: classification and report of a glycine-rich trypsin inhibitor class |journal=J. Agric. Food Chem. |year=1987 |volume=35 |issue=6 |page=974 |doi=10.1021/jf00078a028}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Lipase]] inhibitors interfere with enzymes, such as [[human pancreatic lipase]], that catalyze the hydrolysis of some [[lipid]]s, including fats. For example, the anti-obesity drug [[orlistat]] causes a percentage of fat to pass through the digestive tract undigested.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Heck AM, Yanovski JA, Calis KA | title = Orlistat, a new lipase inhibitor for the management of obesity | journal = Pharmacotherapy | volume = 20 | issue = 3 | pages = 270–9 | date = March 2000 | pmid = 10730683 | doi = 10.1592/phco.20.4.270.34882 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Amylase]] inhibitors prevent the action of enzymes that break the [[glycosidic bond]]s of [[starch]]es and other complex [[carbohydrate]]s, preventing the release of simple sugars and absorption by the body. [[Amylase]] inhibitors, like lipase inhibitors, have been used as a diet aid and obesity treatment. Amylase inhibitors are present in many types of beans; commercially available amylase inhibitors are extracted from white [[kidney bean]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Preuss HG | title = Bean amylase inhibitor and other carbohydrate absorption blockers: effects on diabesity and general health | journal = Journal of the American College of Nutrition | volume = 28 | issue = 3 | pages = 266–76 | date = June 2009 | pmid = 20150600 | doi = 10.1080/07315724.2009.10719781 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Oxalic acid]] and [[oxalate]]s are present in many plants and in significant amounts particularly in [[rhubarb]], [[tea]], [[spinach]], [[parsley]] and [[Portulaca oleracea|purslane]]. Oxalates bind to [[calcium]] and prevent its absorption in the human body.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Dolan LC, Matulka RA, Burdock GA | title = Naturally occurring food toxins | journal = Toxins | volume = 2 | issue = 9 | pages = 2289–332 | date = September 2010 | pmid = 22069686 | pmc = 3153292 | doi = 10.3390/toxins2092289 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Glucosinolate]]s prevent the uptake of [[iodine]], affecting the function of the [[thyroid]] and thus are considered [[goitrogen]]s. They are found in plants such as [[broccoli]], [[Brussels sprout|brussel sprouts]], [[cabbage]], [[Brassica juncea|mustard greens]], [[radish]]es and [[cauliflower]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Dolan LC, Matulka RA, Burdock GA | title = Naturally occurring food toxins | journal = Toxins | volume = 2 | issue = 9 | pages = 2289–332 | date = September 2010 | pmid = 22069686 | pmc = 3153292 | doi = 10.3390/toxins2092289 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Excessive intake of required nutrients can also result in them having an anti-nutrient action. Excessive intake of [[dietary fiber]] can reduce the transit time through the intestines to such a degree that other nutrients cannot be absorbed. However, this effect is often not seen in practice and reduction of absorbed minerals can be attributed mainly to the phytic acids in fibrous food.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://lpi.oregonstate.edu/mic/other-nutrients/fiber|title=Fiber|last=|first=|date=2014-04-28|work=Linus Pauling Institute|access-date=2018-04-15|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180414180232/http://lpi.oregonstate.edu/mic/other-nutrients/fiber|archive-date=2018-04-13|dead-url=no|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Coudray C, Demigné C, Rayssiguier Y | title = Effects of dietary fibers on magnesium absorption in animals and humans | journal = The Journal of Nutrition | volume = 133 | issue = 1 | pages = 1–4 | date = January 2003 | pmid = 12514257 | doi = 10.1093/jn/133.1.1 | url = https://academic.oup.com/jn/article/133/1/1/4687577 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Foods high in [[Calcium in biology|calcium]] eaten simultaneously with foods containing [[iron]] can decrease the absorption of iron via an unclear mechanism involving iron [[transport protein]] h[[DMT1]], which calcium can inhibit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Scheers N | title = Regulatory effects of Cu, Zn, and Ca on Fe absorption: the intricate play between nutrient transporters | journal = Nutrients | volume = 5 | issue = 3 | pages = 957–70 | date = March 2013 | pmid = 23519291 | pmc = 3705329 | doi = 10.3390/nu5030957 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some [[Protein (nutrient)|proteins]] can also be antinutrients, such as the [[trypsin inhibitor]]s and [[lectin]]s found in [[legume]]s. These [[enzyme inhibitor]]s interfere with digestion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Gilani GS, Cockell KA, Sepehr E | title = Effects of antinutritional factors on protein digestibility and amino acid availability in foods | journal = Journal of AOAC International | volume = 88 | issue = 3 | pages = 967–87 | date = May 2005 | pmid = 16001874 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Avidin]] is an antinutrient found in active form in raw [[egg white]]s.

Widespread form of antinutrients are the [[flavonoid]]s, which are a group of [[polyphenol]]ic compounds that include [[tannin]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Beecher GR | title = Overview of dietary flavonoids: nomenclature, occurrence and intake | journal = The Journal of Nutrition | volume = 133 | issue = 10 | pages = 3248S-3254S | date = October 2003 | pmid = 14519822 | doi = 10.1093/jn/133.10.3248S | url = http://jn.nutrition.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&amp;pmid=14519822 }}&lt;/ref&gt; These compounds [[chelate]] metals such as iron and zinc and reduce the absorption of these nutrients,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Karamać M | title = Chelation of Cu(II), Zn(II), and Fe(II) by tannin constituents of selected edible nuts | journal = International Journal of Molecular Sciences | volume = 10 | issue = 12 | pages = 5485–97 | date = December 2009 | pmid = 20054482 | pmc = 2802006 | doi = 10.3390/ijms10125485 }}&lt;/ref&gt; but they also inhibit digestive enzymes and may also precipitate proteins.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Adamczyk B, Simon J, Kitunen V, Adamczyk S, Smolander A | title = Tannins and Their Complex Interaction with Different Organic Nitrogen Compounds and Enzymes: Old Paradigms versus Recent Advances | journal = ChemistryOpen | volume = 6 | issue = 5 | pages = 610–614 | date = October 2017 | pmid = 29046854 | pmc = 5641916 | doi = 10.1002/open.201700113 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Occurrence ==
Antinutrients are found at some level in almost all foods for a variety of reasons. However, their levels are reduced in modern crops, probably as an outcome of the process of [[domestication]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Plant Toxins and Antinutrients |author=GEO-PIE Project |publisher=[[Cornell University]] |url=http://www.geo-pie.cornell.edu/issues/toxins.html |deadurl=yes |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080612160331/http://www.geo-pie.cornell.edu/issues/toxins.html |archive-date=June 12, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The possibility now exists to eliminate antinutrients entirely using [[genetic engineering]]; but, since these compounds may also have beneficial effects, such genetic modifications could make the foods more nutritious but not improve people's health.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Welch RM, Graham RD | title = Breeding for micronutrients in staple food crops from a human nutrition perspective | journal = Journal of Experimental Botany | volume = 55 | issue = 396 | pages = 353–64 | date = February 2004 | pmid = 14739261 | doi = 10.1093/jxb/erh064 | url = http://jexbot.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&amp;pmid=14739261 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many traditional methods of food preparation such as [[fermentation (food)|fermentation]], [[cooking]], and [[malting]] increase the nutritive quality of plant foods through reducing certain antinutrients such as phytic acid, polyphenols, and oxalic acid.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Hotz C, Gibson RS | title = Traditional food-processing and preparation practices to enhance the bioavailability of micronutrients in plant-based diets | journal = The Journal of Nutrition | volume = 137 | issue = 4 | pages = 1097–100 | date = April 2007 | pmid = 17374686 | doi = 10.1093/jn/137.4.1097 | url = http://jn.nutrition.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&amp;pmid=17374686 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Such processing methods are widely used in societies where cereals and legumes form a major part of the diet.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Chavan JK, Kadam SS | title = Nutritional improvement of cereals by fermentation | journal = Critical Reviews in Food Science and Nutrition | volume = 28 | issue = 5 | pages = 349–400 | year = 1989 | pmid = 2692608 | doi = 10.1080/10408398909527507 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Phillips RD | title = Starchy legumes in human nutrition, health and culture | journal = Plant Foods for Human Nutrition | volume = 44 | issue = 3 | pages = 195–211 | date = November 1993 | pmid = 8295859 | doi = 10.1007/BF01088314 }}&lt;/ref&gt; An important example of such processing is the fermentation of [[cassava]] to produce cassava flour: this fermentation reduces the levels of both toxins and antinutrients in the tuber.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Oboh G, Oladunmoye MK | title = Biochemical changes in micro-fungi fermented cassava flour produced from low- and medium-cyanide variety of cassava tubers | journal = Nutrition and Health | volume = 18 | issue = 4 | pages = 355–67 | year = 2007 | pmid = 18087867 | doi = 10.1177/026010600701800405 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Applied mathematics''' is the application of [[mathematical model|mathematical method]]s by different fields such as [[science]], [[engineering]], [[business]], [[computer science]], and [[industry]]. Thus, applied mathematics is a combination of [[mathematical science]] and specialized knowledge. The term "applied mathematics" also describes the [[profession|professional specialty]]  in which mathematicians work on practical problems by formulating and studying mathematical models. In the past, practical applications have motivated the development of mathematical theories, which then became the subject of study in [[pure mathematics]] where abstract concepts are studied for their own sake. The activity of applied mathematics is thus intimately connected with research in pure mathematics.

Historically, applied mathematics consisted principally of [[Mathematical analysis|applied analysis]], most notably [[differential equations]]; [[approximation theory]] (broadly construed, to include [[Representation (mathematics)|representation]]s, [[Asymptotic analysis|asymptotic]] methods, [[Calculus of variations|variational methods]], and [[numerical analysis]]); and applied [[probability]].  These areas of mathematics related directly to the development of [[Newtonian physics]], and in fact, the distinction between mathematicians and physicists was not sharply drawn before the mid-19th century.  This history left a pedagogical legacy in the United States: until the early 20th century, subjects such as [[classical mechanics]] were often taught in applied mathematics departments at American universities rather than in [[physics]] departments, and [[fluid mechanics]] may still be taught in applied mathematics departments.&lt;ref name="Stolz2002"&gt;

[[File:HD-Rayleigh-Taylor.gif|left|thumb|Fluid mechanics is often considered a branch of applied mathematics and mechanical engineering.]]

Today, the term "applied mathematics" is used in a broader sense. It includes the classical areas noted above as well as other areas that have become increasingly important in applications. Even fields such as [[number theory]] that are part of [[pure mathematics]] are now important in applications (such as [[cryptography]]), though they are not generally considered to be part of the field of applied mathematics ''per se''. Sometimes, the term "[[applicable mathematics]]" is used to distinguish between the traditional applied mathematics that developed alongside physics and the many areas of mathematics that are applicable to real-world problems today.

There is no consensus as to what the various branches of applied mathematics are. Such categorizations are made difficult by the way mathematics and science change over time, and also by the way universities organize departments, courses, and degrees.

Many mathematicians distinguish between "applied mathematics," which is concerned with mathematical methods, and the "applications of mathematics" within science and engineering. A [[biology|biologist]] using a [[Matrix population models|population model]] and applying known mathematics would not be ''doing'' applied mathematics, but rather ''using'' it; however, mathematical biologists have posed problems that have stimulated the growth of pure mathematics. Mathematicians such as [[Henri Poincaré|Poincaré]] and [[Vladimir Arnold|Arnold]] deny the existence of "applied mathematics" and claim that there are only "applications of mathematics."  Similarly, non-mathematicians blend applied mathematics and applications of mathematics. The use and development of mathematics to solve industrial problems is also called "industrial mathematics".&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | author=University of Strathclyde | title=Industrial Mathematics | url=http://www.maths.strath.ac.uk/applying/postgraduate/research_topics/industrial_mathematics | date=17 January 2008 | accessdate=8 January 2009 | archive-url=https://archive.is/20120804104748/http://www.maths.strath.ac.uk/applying/postgraduate/research_topics/industrial_mathematics | archive-date=2012-08-04 | dead-url=yes | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The success of modern numerical mathematical methods and software has led to the emergence of [[computational mathematics]], [[computational science]], and [[computational engineering]], which use [[supercomputer|high-performance computing]] for the [[simulation]] of phenomena and the solution of problems in the sciences and engineering. These are often considered interdisciplinary.

Historically, mathematics was most important in the [[natural sciences]] and [[engineering]]. However, since [[World War II]], fields outside the physical sciences have spawned the creation of new areas of mathematics, such as [[game theory]] and [[social choice theory]], which grew out of economic considerations.

The advent of the computer has enabled new applications: studying and using the new computer technology itself ([[computer science]]) to study problems arising in other areas of science (computational science) as well as the mathematics of computation (for example, [[theoretical computer science]], [[computer algebra]], [[numerical analysis]]).  [[Statistics]] is probably the most widespread [[mathematical science]] used in the [[social sciences]], but other areas of mathematics, most notably [[economics]], are proving increasingly useful in these disciplines.

== Status in academic departments ==

Academic institutions are not consistent in the way they group and label courses, programs, and degrees in applied mathematics.  At some schools, there is a single mathematics department, whereas others have separate departments for Applied Mathematics and (Pure) Mathematics.  It is very common for Statistics departments to be separated at schools with graduate programs, but many undergraduate-only institutions include statistics under the mathematics department.

Many applied mathematics programs (as opposed to departments) consist of primarily cross-listed courses and jointly appointed faculty in departments representing applications.  Some Ph.D. programs in applied mathematics require little or no coursework outside mathematics, while others require substantial coursework in a specific area of application.  In some respects this difference reflects the distinction between "application of mathematics" and "applied mathematics".

Some universities in the [[United Kingdom|UK]] host departments of ''Applied Mathematics and Theoretical Physics'',&lt;ref&gt;For example see, [http://www.tait.ac.uk/History.html The Tait Institute: History (2nd par.)]. Accessed Nov 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.am.qub.ac.uk Dept of Applied Mathematics &amp; Theoretical Physics.] [[Queen's University, Belfast]].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.researchgate.net/institution/Queens_University_Belfast/department/Department_of_Applied_Mathematics_Theoretical_Physics DAMTP Belfast ResearchGate page].&lt;/ref&gt; but it is now much less common to have separate departments of pure and applied mathematics. A notable exception to this is the [[Faculty of Mathematics, University of Cambridge|Department of Applied Mathematics and Theoretical Physics]] at the [[University of Cambridge]], housing the [[Lucasian Professor of Mathematics]] whose past holders include [[Isaac Newton]], [[Charles Babbage]], [[James Lighthill]], [[Paul Dirac]] and [[Stephen Hawking]].

Schools with separate applied mathematics departments range from [[Brown University]], which has a large Division of Applied Mathematics that offers degrees through the [[doctorate]], to [[Santa Clara University]], which offers only the [[Master of Science|M.S.]] in applied mathematics.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Santa Clara University Dept of Applied Mathematics |url=http://www.scu.edu/academics/bulletins/undergraduate/Department-of-Applied-Mathematics.cfm |accessdate=2011-03-05 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110504005925/http://www.scu.edu/academics/bulletins/undergraduate/Department-of-Applied-Mathematics.cfm |archivedate=2011-05-04 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Research universities dividing their mathematics department into pure and applied sections include [[MIT]]. [[Brigham Young University]] also has an Applied and Computational Emphasis (ACME), a program that allows student to graduate with a Mathematics degree, with an emphasis in Applied Math. Students in this program also learn another skill (Computer Science, Engineering, Physics, Pure Math, etc.) to supplement their applied math skills.

== Associated mathematical sciences ==
[[File:Oldfaithful3.png|thumb|right|Applied mathematics has substantial overlap with statistics.]]

Applied mathematics is closely related to other mathematical sciences.

===Scientific computing===
[[Scientific computing]] includes applied mathematics (especially [[numerical analysis]]), [[computing science]] (especially [[high-performance computing]]), and mathematical modelling in a scientific discipline.

===Computer science===
[[Computer science]] relies on [[logic]], [[algebra]], [[graph theory]], and [[combinatorics]].

===Operations research and management science===
[[Operations research]] and [[management science]] are often taught in faculties of engineering, business, and public policy.

===Statistics===
Applied mathematics has substantial overlap with the discipline of statistics. [[Statisticians|Statistical theorists]] study and improve statistical procedures with mathematics, and statistical research often raises mathematical questions. Statistical theory relies on [[Probability theory|probability]] and [[optimal decision|decision theory]], and makes extensive use of scientific computing, analysis, and [[Mathematical optimization|optimization]]; for the [[design of experiments]], statisticians use [[algebraic statistics|algebra]] and [[combinatorial design]]. Applied mathematicians and [[statistician]]s often work in a department of mathematical sciences (particularly at colleges and small universities).

===Actuarial science===
[[Actuarial science]] applies probability, statistics, and economic theory to assess risk in insurance, finance and other industries and professions.

===Mathematical economics===
[[Mathematical economics]] is the application of  mathematical methods to represent theories and analyze problems in economics. The applied methods usually refer to nontrivial mathematical techniques or approaches. Mathematical economics is based on statistics, probability, mathematical programming (as well as other [[computational economics|computational methods]]), operations research, game theory, and some methods from mathematical analysis. In this regard, it resembles  (but is distinct from) [[financial mathematics]], another part of applied mathematics.

According to the [[Mathematics Subject Classification]] (MSC), mathematical economics falls into the [[Mathematics Subject Classification#Applied mathematics / other|Applied mathematics/other]] classification of category 91:
:Game theory, economics, social and behavioral sciences

with [http://msc2010.org/mscwiki/index.php?title=MSC2010 MSC2010] classifications for '[[Game theory]]' at codes [http://msc2010.org/mscwiki/index.php?title=91Axx 91Axx] and for 'Mathematical economics' at codes [http://msc2010.org/mscwiki/index.php?title=91Bxx 91Bxx].

===Applicable mathematics===
'''Applicable mathematics''' is a subdiscipline of applied mathematics, although there is no consensus as to a precise definition.&lt;ref name=OtteEtAl/&gt; Sometimes the term "applicable mathematics" is used to distinguish between the traditional applied mathematics that developed alongside physics and the many areas of mathematics that are applicable to real-world problems today.

Mathematicians often distinguish between "applied mathematics" on the one hand, and the "applications of mathematics" or "applicable mathematics" both within and outside of science and engineering, on the other.&lt;ref name=OtteEtAl&gt;

Volume 2 of Mathematics Education Library; Springer Science &amp; Business Media, 2012. {{ISBN|9400945043}}, 9789400945043.&lt;/ref&gt; Some mathematicians emphasize the term applicable mathematics to separate or delineate the traditional applied areas from new applications arising from fields that were previously seen as pure mathematics.&lt;ref name=rektorys/&gt; For example, from this viewpoint, an ecologist or geographer using population models and applying known mathematics would not be doing applied, but rather applicable, mathematics. Even fields such as number theory that are part of pure mathematics are now important in applications (such as [[cryptography]]), though they are not generally considered to be part of the field of applied mathematics ''per se''.

Other authors prefer describing ''applicable mathematics'' as a union of "new" mathematical applications with the traditional fields of applied mathematics.&lt;ref name=rektorys&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=-sztCAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PR17&amp;dq=survey+of+applicable+mathematics&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=applicable%20mathematics&amp;f=false Survey of Applicable Mathematics, pg xvii (Foreword). ] K.

===Other disciplines===
The line between applied mathematics and specific areas of application is often blurred.  Many universities teach mathematical and statistical courses outside the respective departments, in departments and areas including business, [[engineering]], [[physics]], [[chemistry]], [[psychology]], [[biology]], [[computer science]], [[scientific computation]], and [[mathematical physics]].

'''Art in Medieval Scotland''' includes all forms of [[Scottish art|artistic production]] within the modern borders of Scotland, between the fifth century and the adoption of the [[Renaissance in Scotland|Renaissance]] in the early sixteenth century. In the [[early Middle Ages]], there were distinct material cultures evident in the different federations and kingdoms within what is now Scotland. [[Pictish art]] was the only uniquely Scottish Medieval style; it can be seen in the extensive survival of carved stones, particularly in the north and east of the country, which hold a variety of recurring images and patterns. It can also be seen in elaborate metal work that largely survives in buried hoards. Irish-Scots art from the kingdom of [[Dál Riata]] suggests that it was one of the places, as a crossroads between cultures, where the Insular style developed.

[[Insular art]] is the name given to the common style that developed in Britain and Ireland from the eighth century and which became highly influential in continental Europe and contributed to the development of [[Romanesque art|Romanesque]] and [[Gothic art|Gothic]] styles. It can be seen in elaborate jewellery, often making extensive use of semi-precious stones, in the heavily carved [[high cross]]es found particularly in the Highlands and Islands, but distributed across the country and particularly in the highly decorated illustrated manuscripts such as the [[Book of Kells]], which may have been begun, or wholly created at the monastic centre of [[Iona]].

Scotland adopted the Romanesque style relatively late and retained and revived elements of its style after the Gothic style had become dominant from the thirteenth century. Much of the best Scottish artwork of the High and Late Middle Ages was either religious in nature or realised in metal and woodwork, and has not survived the impact of time and the Reformation. However, examples of sculpture are extant as part of church architecture, including evidence of elaborate church interiors. From the thirteenth century there are relatively large numbers of monumental effigies. Native craftsmanship can be seen in a variety of items. Visual illustration can be seen in the illumination of charters and occasional survivals of church paintings. Surviving copies of individual portraits are relatively crude, but more impressive are the works or artists commissioned from the continent, particularly the Netherlands.

===Pictish stones===
{{Main|Pictish stones}}
[[File:DunnichenMeffan.jpg|thumb|right|upright|The [[Dunnichen Stone]], a Class I incised stone, with [[Double disc (Pictish symbol)|double disc and z-rod]], [[Mirror and comb (Pictish symbol)|mirror and comb]] and flower Pictish symbols]]
About 250 Pictish stones survive and have been assigned by scholars to three classes.&lt;ref&gt;J. N. G. Ritchie and A. Ritchie, ''Scotland, Archaeology and Early History'' (Edinburgh: Edinburgh University Press, 2nd edn., 1991), {{ISBN|0748602917}}, pp. 161–5.&lt;/ref&gt; Class I stones are those thought to date to the period up to the seventh century and are the most numerous group. The stones are largely unshaped and include incised symbols of animals such as fish and the [[Pictish beast]], everyday objects such as mirrors, combs and tuning forks and abstract symbols defined by names including V-rod, double disc and Z-rod. They are found between from the [[Firth of Forth]] to [[Shetland]]. The greatest concentrations are in Sutherland, around modern Inverness and Aberdeen. Good examples include the [[Dunrobin Castle|Dunrobin]] (Sutherland) and [[Aberlemno]] stones ([[Angus, Scotland|Angus]]).&lt;ref name=Graham-Campbell1998pp.7-8&gt;[[James Graham-Campbell|J. Graham-Campbell]] and C. E. Batey, ''Vikings in Scotland: an Archaeological Survey'' (Edinburgh: Edinburgh University Press, 1998), {{ISBN|0748606416}}, pp. 7–8.&lt;/ref&gt;

Class II stones are carefully shaped slabs dating after the arrival of Christianity in the eighth and ninth centuries, with a cross on one face and a wide range of symbols on the reverse. In smaller numbers than Class I stones, they predominate in southern Pictland, in Perth, Angus and Fife. Good examples include [[Glamis]] 2, which contains a finely executed [[Celtic cross]] on the main face with two opposing male figures, a centaur, cauldron, deer head and a triple disc symbol and Cossans, Angus, which shows a high-prowed Pictish boat with oarsmen and a figure facing forward in the prow.&lt;ref name=Graham-Campbell1998pp.7-8/&gt; Class III stones are thought to overlap chronologically with Class II stones.&lt;ref name=Graham-Campbell1998pp.7-8/&gt; Most are elaborately shaped and incised cross-slabs, some with figurative scenes, but lacking idiomatic Pictish symbols. They are widely distributed but predominate in the southern Pictish areas.&lt;ref name=Graham-Campbell1998pp.7-8/&gt;

===Pictish metalwork===
Items of metalwork have been found throughout Pictland. The earlier Picts appear to have had a considerable amount of silver available, probably from raiding further south, or the payment of subsidies to keep them from doing so. The very large hoard of late Roman [[hacksilver]] found at [[Traprain Law]] may have originated in either way. The largest hoard of early Pictish metalwork was found in 1819 at Norrie's Law in Fife, but unfortunately much was dispersed and melted down.&lt;ref name=Youngs1989pp26-8&gt;S. Youngs, ed., ''"The Work of Angels", Masterpieces of Celtic Metalwork, 6th–9th centuries AD'' (London: British Museum Press, 1989), {{ISBN|0714105546}}, pp. 26–8.&lt;/ref&gt; Over ten heavy silver chains, some over {{convert|0.5|m|ft}} long, have been found from this period; the double-linked [[Whitecleuch Chain]] is one of only two that have a penannular ring, with symbol decoration including enamel, which shows how these were probably used as "choker" necklaces.&lt;ref name=Youngs1989pp26-8/&gt; The [[St Ninian's Isle]] Treasure of 28 silver and silver-gilt objects, contains perhaps the best collection of late Pictish forms, from the Christian period, when Pictish metalwork style, as with stone-carving, gradually merged with Insular, Anglo-Saxon and Viking styles.&lt;ref&gt;L. R. Laing, ''Later Celtic Art in Britain and Ireland'' (London: Osprey Publishing, 1987), {{ISBN|0852638744}}, p. 37.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Irish-Scots art===
{{See also|Irish art}}
[[File:Hunterston BroochDSCF6363.jpg|thumb|upright|left|The front of the [[Hunterston Brooch]], found near [[Hunterston]], [[North Ayrshire]], which shows Irish elements of style and may have been made in the kingdom of [[Dál Riata]]]]
[[Thomas Charles-Edwards]] has suggested that the kingdom of Dál Riata was a cross-roads between the artistic styles of the Picts and those of Ireland, with which the Scots settlers in what is now Argyll kept close contacts. This can be seen in representations found in excavations of the fortress of Dunadd, which combine Pictish and Irish elements.&lt;ref&gt;T. M. Charles-Edwards, ''Early Christian Ireland'' (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2000), {{ISBN|0521363950}}, pp. 331–2.&lt;/ref&gt; This included extensive evidence for the production of high status jewellery and moulds from the seventh century that indicate the production of pieces similar to the [[Hunterston brooch]], found in Ayrshire, which may have been made in Dál Riata, but with elements that suggest Irish origins. These and other finds, including a trumpet spiral decorated hanging bowl disc and a stamped animal decoration (or pressblech), perhaps from a bucket or drinking horn, indicate the ways in which Dál Riata was one of the locations where the Insular style was developed.&lt;ref name=Lane2001&gt;A. Lane, [http://www.britarch.ac.uk/ba/ba62/feat1.shtml "Citadel of the first Scots"], ''British Archaeology'', 62, December 2001. Retrieved 2 December 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; In the eighth and ninth centuries the Pictish elite adopted true penannular [[brooch]]es with lobed terminals from Ireland. Some older Irish [[pseudo-penannular]] brooches were adapted to the Pictish style, for example the Breadalbane Brooch (British Museum). The eighth century [[Monymusk Reliquary]] has elements of Pictish and Irish style.&lt;ref name=Youngs1989pp109-1123&gt;S. Youngs, ed., ''"The Work of Angels", Masterpieces of Celtic Metalwork, 6th–9th centuries AD'' (London: British Museum Press, 1989), {{ISBN|0714105546}}, pp. 109–113.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Early Anglo-Saxon art===
{{Main|Anglo-Saxon art}}
Early examples of Anglo-Saxon art are largely metalwork, particularly bracelets, clasps and jewellery, that has survived in pagan burials and in exceptional items such as the intricately carved whalebone [[Franks Casket]], thought to have been produced in [[Northumbria]] in the early eighth century, which combines pagan, classical and Christian motifs.&lt;ref&gt;[[Charles Reginald Dodwell|C. R. Dodwell]], ''Anglo-Saxon Art: A New Perspective'' (Manchester: Manchester University Press, 1982), {{ISBN|071900926X}}, pp. 2–4.&lt;/ref&gt; There is only one known pagan burial in Scotland, at [[Dalmeny]] Midlothian, which contains a necklace of beads similar to those found in mid-seventh-century southern England. Other isolated finds include a gold object from Dalmeny, shaped like a truncated pyramid, with [[filigree]] and [[garnet]], similar to sword harness mounts found at [[Sutton Hoo]]. There is also a bun-shaped loom from [[Yetholm]], Roxburghshire and a ring with an Anglian [[runes|runic]] inscription. From eastern Scotland there is a seventh-century sword [[Hilt#Pommel|pommel]] from [[Culbin Sands]], Moray and the [[Burghead]] drinking horn mount.&lt;ref&gt;L. Laing, ''The Archaeology of Late Celtic Britain and Ireland C. 400–1200 AD'' (London: Taylor &amp; Francis, 1975), {{ISBN|0416823602}}, p. 28.&lt;/ref&gt; After [[Christianisation of Scotland|Christianisation]] in the seventh century artistic styles in Northumbria, which then reached to the Firth of Forth, interacted with those in Ireland and what is now Scotland to become part of the common style historians have identified as Insular or Hiberno-Saxon.&lt;ref&gt;C. E Karkov, ''The Art of Anglo-Saxon England'' (Boydell Press, 2011), {{ISBN|1843836289}}, p. 5.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Insular art===
{{Main|Insular art}}
[[File:KellsFol292rIncipJohn.jpg|thumb|right|upright|The opening page from the [[Gospel of John]] from the [[Book of Kells]], usually thought to have been made in [[Iona]].]]
Insular art, or Hiberno-Saxon art, is the name given to the common style produced in Scotland, Britain and Anglo-Saxon England from the seventh century, with the combining of Celtic and Anglo-Saxon forms.&lt;ref&gt;H. Honour and J. Fleming, ''A World History of Art'' (London: Macmillan), {{ISBN|0333371852}}, pp. 244–7.&lt;/ref&gt; Surviving examples of Insular art are found in metalwork, carving, but mainly in [[illuminated manuscript]]s. In manuscripts surfaces are highly decorated with intricate patterning, with no attempt to give an impression of depth, volume or recession. The best examples include the [[Book of Kells]], which may have been wholly or partly created in Iona, and the [[Book of Durrow]], which may be from Ireland or Northumbria. [[Carpet pages]] are a characteristic feature of Insular manuscripts, although [[historiated initial]]s (an Insular invention), [[canon table]]s and figurative miniatures, especially [[Evangelist portrait]]s, are also common. The finest era of the style was brought to an end by the disruption to monastic centres and aristocratic life of the Viking raids in the late eighth century.&lt;ref&gt;C. R. Dodwell, ''The Pictorial Arts of the West, 800–1200'' (Yale UP, 1993), {{ISBN|0300064934}}, pp. 85 and 90.&lt;/ref&gt;

Christianity discouraged the burial of grave goods so the majority of examples of insular metalwork that survive from the Christian period have been found in archaeological contexts that suggest they were rapidly hidden, lost or abandoned.&lt;ref&gt;C. R. Dodwell, ''Anglo-Saxon Art, a New Perspective''  (Manchester:Manchester University Press, 1982), {{ISBN|071900926X}}, p. 4.&lt;/ref&gt; There are a few exceptions, notably portable [[shrine]]s ("[[cumdach]]s") for books or [[relic]]s, several of which have been continuously owned, mostly by churches on the Continent—though the [[Monymusk Reliquary]] has always been in Scotland.&lt;ref&gt;S. Youngs, ed., ''"The Work of Angels", Masterpieces of Celtic Metalwork'' (London: British Museum Press, 1989), {{ISBN|0714105546}}, pp. 134–140.&lt;/ref&gt; The highest quality survivals are either secular jewellery, the largest and most elaborate pieces probably for male wearers, tableware or altarware. The finest church pieces were probably made by secular workshops, often attached to a royal household, though other pieces were made by monastic workshops.&lt;ref&gt;S. Youngs, ed., ''"The Work of Angels", Masterpieces of Celtic Metalwork'' (London: British Museum Press, 1989), {{ISBN|0714105546}}, pp. 15–16.&lt;/ref&gt; There are a number of large brooches, each of their designs is wholly individual in detail, and the workmanship is varied. Many elements of the designs can be directly related to elements used in manuscripts. Surviving stones used in decoration are semi-precious ones, with [[amber]] and [[rock crystal]] among the commonest, and some [[garnet]]s. Coloured glass, [[Vitreous enamel|enamel]] and [[millefiori]] glass, probably imported, are also used.&lt;ref&gt;S.

The most significant survivals in sculpture are in [[High cross]]es, large free-standing stone crosses, usually carved in relief with patterns, biblical iconography and occasionally inscriptions. The tradition may have begun in Ireland or Anglo-Saxon England and then spread to Scotland.&lt;ref name=Koch2006pp915-19&gt;J. T. Koch, ''Celtic Culture: A Historical Encyclopedia, Volumes 1–5'' (ABC-CLIO, 2006), {{ISBN|1851094407}}, pp. 915–19.&lt;/ref&gt; They are found throughout the British Isles and often feature a stone ring around the intersection, forming a [[Celtic cross]], apparently an innovation of Celtic Christianity, that may have begun at [[Iona]].&lt;ref&gt;D. M. Wilson, ''Anglo-Saxon Art: From The Seventh Century To The Norman Conquest'' (Overlook Press), 1984, p. 118.&lt;/ref&gt; Distribution in Scotland is heaviest in the Highlands and Islands and they can be dated to the period c. 750 to 1150.&lt;ref name=Koch2006pp915-19/&gt; All the surviving crosses are of stone, but there are indications that large numbers of wooden crosses may also have existed. In Scotland biblical iconography is less common than in Ireland, but the subject of [[King David]] is relatively frequently depicted. In the east the influence of Pictish sculpture can be seen, in areas of Viking occupation and settlement, crosses for the tenth to the twelfth centuries have distinctive Scandinavian patterns, often mixed with native styles. Important examples dated to the eighth century include St Martin's Cross on Iona, the [[Kildalton Cross]] from the Hebrides and the Anglo-Saxon [[Ruthwell Cross]].&lt;ref name=Koch2006pp915-19/&gt; Through the [[Hiberno-Scottish mission]] to the continent, insular art was highly influential on subsequent European Medieval art, especially the decorative elements of [[Romanesque art|Romanesque]] and [[Gothic art|Gothic]] styles.&lt;ref&gt;G. Henderson, ''Early Medieval Art'' (London: Penguin, 1972), pp. 63–71.&lt;/ref&gt;

Viking art avoided naturalism, favouring stylised animal motifs to create its ornamental patterns. Ribbon-interlace was important and plant motifs became fashionable in the tenth and eleventh centuries.&lt;ref&gt;J. Graham-Campbell and C. E. Batey, ''Vikings in Scotland: an Archaeological Survey'' (Edinburgh: Edinburgh University Press, 1998), {{ISBN|0748606416}}, p. 34.&lt;/ref&gt; Most Scottish artefacts come from 130 "pagan" burials in the north and west from the mid-ninth to the mid-tenth centuries.&lt;ref&gt;M. Carver, ''The Cross Goes North: Processes of Conversion in Northern Europe, AD 300–1300'' (Boydell Press, 2006), {{ISBN|1843831252}}, p. 219.&lt;/ref&gt; These include jewellery, weapons and occasional elaborate high status items.&lt;ref&gt;J. Jesch, ''Women in the Viking Age'' (Boydell &amp; Brewer, 1991), {{ISBN|0851153607}}, p. 14.&lt;/ref&gt; Amongst the most impressive of these is the [[Scar boat burial]], on Orkney, which contained an elaborate sword, quiver with arrows, a brooch, bone comb, gaming pieces and the Scar Dragon Plaque, made from whalebone, most of which were probably made in Scandinavia.&lt;ref&gt;K. Holman, ''The Northern [I. E. Northern] Conquest: Vikings in Britain and Ireland'' (Signal Books, 2007), {{ISBN|1904955347}}, p. 137.&lt;/ref&gt; From the west, another boat burial at Kiloron Bay in [[Colonsay]] revealed a sword, shield, iron cauldron and enamelled scales, which may be Celtic in origin.&lt;ref&gt;L. Laing, ''The Archaeology of Late Celtic Britain and Ireland C. 400–1200 AD'' (London: Taylor &amp; Francis, 1975), {{ISBN|0416823602}}, p. 201.&lt;/ref&gt; A combination of Viking and Celtic styles can be see in a [[penannular brooch]] from Pierowall in Orkney, which has a Pictish-style looped pin. It is about two inches in diameter, with traces of gilding, and probably housed a piece of amber surrounded by interweaving ribbons.&lt;ref&gt;W. Nolan, L. Ronayne and M. Dunlevy, eds, ''Donegal: History &amp; Society: Interdisciplinary Essays on the History of an Irish County'' (Geography, 1995), {{ISBN|0906602459}}, p. 96.&lt;/ref&gt; After the conversion to Christianity, from the tenth to the twelfth centuries, stone crosses and cross-slabs in Viking occupied areas of the Highlands and Islands were carved with successive styles of Viking ornament.&lt;ref&gt;J. Koch, ''Celtic Culture: Aberdeen Breviary-Celticism'' (ABC-CLIO, 2006), {{ISBN|1851094407}}. p. 918.&lt;/ref&gt; They were frequently mixed with native interlace and animal patterns. Examples include the eleventh-century cross-slab from Dóid Mhàiri on the island of [[Islay]], where the plant motifs on either side of the cross-shaft are based upon the [[Ringerike style]] of Viking art.&lt;ref&gt;J. Graham-Campbell and C. E. Batey. ''Vikings in Scotland: an Archaeological Survey'' (Edinburgh: Edinburgh University Press, 1998), {{ISBN|0748606416}}, p. 90.&lt;/ref&gt; The most famous artistic find from modern Scotland, the [[Lewis Chessmen]], from [[Uig, Lewis|Uig]], were probably made in [[Trondheim]] in Norway, but contain some decoration that may have been influenced by Celtic patterns.&lt;ref&gt;M.

==Late Middle Ages==
===Architecture and sculpture===
{{Main|Architecture in Medieval Scotland}}

Architectural evidence suggests that, while the Romanesque style peaked in much of Europe in the later eleventh and early twelfth century, it was still reaching Scotland in the second half of the twelfth century&lt;ref&gt;R. N. Swanson, ''The Twelfth-Century Renaissance'' (Manchester: Manchester University Press, 1999), {{ISBN|0719042569}}, p. 155.&lt;/ref&gt; and was revived in the late fifteenth century, perhaps as a reaction to the [[English Gothic architecture|English perpendicular]] style that had come to dominate.&lt;ref&gt;T. M. Devine and J. Wormald, ''The Oxford Handbook of Modern Scottish History'' (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2012), {{ISBN|0191624330}}, p. 190.&lt;/ref&gt; Much of the best Scottish artwork of the High and Late Middle Ages was either religious in nature or realised in metal and woodwork and has not survived the impact of time and the Reformation.&lt;ref name=Webster1997pp127-9/&gt; However, examples of sculpture are extant as part of church architecture, a small number of significant crafted items have also survived and, for the end of the period, there is evidence of painting, particularly the extensive commissioning of works in the Low Countries and France.&lt;ref name="Wormald1991pp57-9"/&gt;

The interiors of churches were often more elaborate before the Reformation, with highly decorated sacrament houses, like the ones surviving at Deskford and Kinkell.&lt;ref name=Whyte&amp;Whyte1991p117&gt;I. D. Whyte and K. A. Whyte, ''The Changing Scottish landscape, 1500–1800'' (London: Taylor &amp; Francis, 1991), {{ISBN|0415029929}}, p. 117.&lt;/ref&gt; The carvings at [[Rosslyn Chapel]], created in the mid-fifteenth century, elaborately depicting the progression of the [[seven deadly sins]], are considered some of the finest in the Gothic style.&lt;ref&gt;S. H. Rigby, ''A Companion to Britain in the Later Middle Ages'' (London: Wiley-Blackwell, 2003), {{ISBN|0631217851}}, p. 532.&lt;/ref&gt; Monumental effigies began to appear in churches from the thirteenth century and they were usually fully coloured and gilded. Many were founders and patrons of churches and chapels, including members of the clergy, knights and often their wives. In contrast to England, where the fashion for stone-carved monuments gave way to brass etchings, they continued to be produced until the end of the Medieval period, with the largest group dating from the fifteenth century,&lt;ref&gt;R. Brydall, ''The Monumental Effigies of Scotland: From the Thirteenth to the Fifteenth Century'' (Kessinger Publishing, 1895, rpt. 2010) {{ISBN|1169232329}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;K. Stevenson, ''Chivalry and Knighthood in Scotland, 1424–1513'' (Boydell Press, 2006), {{ISBN|1843831929}}, pp. 125–8.&lt;/ref&gt; including the very elaborate Douglas tombs in the town of [[Douglas, South Lanarkshire|Douglas]].&lt;ref name=Whyte&amp;Whyte1991p117/&gt; Sometimes the best continental artists were employed, as for [[Robert I of Scotland|Robert I]]'s elaborate tomb in [[Dunfermline Abbey]], which was made in his lifetime by the Parisian sculptor Thomas of Chartres, but of which only fragments now survive.&lt;ref name=Webster1997pp127-9/&gt; The greatest group of surviving sculpture from this period are from the West Highlands, beginning in the fourteenth century on Iona under the patronage of the [[Lord of the Isles|Lordship of the Isles]] and continuing until the Reformation. Common motifs were ships, swords, harps and Romanesque vine leaf tracery with Celtic elements.&lt;ref&gt;M. MacDonald, ''Scottish Art'' (London: Thames and Hudson, 2000), {{ISBN|0500203334}}, pp. 34–5.&lt;/ref&gt;{{clear}}

===Decorative arts===
{{Main|Sculpture in Scotland}}
[[File:Financrozier2.jpg|thumb|upright|The 12th century "Loch Shiel Crozier Drop", hollow for a relic, with the bust of a king.&lt;ref&gt;V. Glenn, ''Romanesque and Gothic: Decorative Metalwork and Ivory Carvings in the Museum of Scotland'' (National Museums of Scotland, 2003), {{ISBN|1901663558}}, pp. 105–106.&lt;/ref&gt;]]
Survivals from late Medieval church fittings and objects in Scotland are exceptionally rare even compared to those from comparable areas like England or Norway, probably because of the thoroughness of their destruction in the [[Scottish Reformation]]. The Scottish elite and church now participated in a culture stretching across Europe, and many objects that do survive are imported, such as [[Limoges enamel]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Glenn, 1–4; Chapter III on enamels&lt;/ref&gt; It is often difficult to decide the country of creation of others, as work in international styles was produced in Scotland, along with pieces retaining more distinctive local styles.

Two secular small chests with carved whalebone panels and metal fittings illustrate some aspects of the Scottish arts. The Eglington and Fife Caskets are very similar and were probably made by the same workshop around 1500, as boxes for valuables such as jewellery or documents. The overall form of the caskets follows French examples, and the locks and metal bands are decorated in Gothic style with "simple decorations of [[fleuron (architectural)|fleuron]]s and debased [[egg and dart]]" while the whalebone panels are carved in [[relief]] with a late form of Insular interwoven [[strapwork]] characteristic of late Medieval West Scotland.&lt;ref&gt;Glenn, 147, 186–191; both now [[Museum of Scotland]]&lt;/ref&gt;

Key examples of native craftsmanship on items include the [[Bute mazer]], the earliest surviving drinking cup of its type, made of maple-wood and with elaborate silver-gilt ornamentation, dated to around 1320.&lt;ref&gt;Glenn, 34–38, and 16th century cover, 191–192&lt;/ref&gt; The Savernake Horn was probably made for the earl of Moray in the fourteenth century and looted by the English in the mid-sixteenth century.&lt;ref name=Webster1997pp127-9&gt;B. Webster, ''Medieval Scotland: the Making of an Identity'' (St. Martin's Press, 1997), {{ISBN|0333567617}}, pp. 127–9.&lt;/ref&gt; A few significant [[reliquaries]] survive from West Scotland, examples of the habit of the [[Celtic church]] of treating the possessions rather than the bones of saints as [[relic]]s. As in Irish examples these were partly reworked and elaborated at intervals over a long period. These are St Fillan's Crozier and its "Coigreach" or [[reliquary]], between them with elements from each century from the eleventh to the fifteenth, the [[Guthrie, Angus|Guthrie]] Bell Shrine, Iona, twelfth to fifteenth century, and the Kilmichael Glassary Bell Shrine, Argyll, mid-twelfth century.&lt;ref&gt;Glenn, 92–115, all Museum of Scotland; MacDonald, ''Scottish Art'' (London: Thames and Hudson, 2000), {{ISBN|0500203334}}, p. 32.&lt;/ref&gt; The Skye Chess piece is a single elaborate piece in carved [[walrus]] ivory, with two warriors carrying heraldic shields in a framework of openwork vegetation. It is thought to be Scottish, of the mid-thirteenth century, with aspects similar to both English and Norwegian pieces.&lt;ref&gt;Glenn, 146–147, 178–181; now Museum of Scotland&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the largest groups of surviving works of art are the seal matrices that appear to have entered Scottish usage with feudalism in the reign of David I, beginning at the royal court and among his Anglo-Norman vassals and then by about 1250 they began to spread to the [[Gaelicisation|Gaelicised]] areas of the country. They would be made compulsory for barons of the king in a statute of 1401&lt;ref&gt;Glenn, 116–144; C. J. Neville, ''Land, Law and People in Medieval Scotland'' (Edinburgh: Edinburgh University Press, 2010), {{ISBN|0748639586}}, pp. 83–99.&lt;/ref&gt; and seal matrices show very high standards of skill and artistry.&lt;ref name=Webster1997pp127-9/&gt; Examples of items that were probably the work of continental artists include the delicate hanging lamp in St. John's Kirk in [[Perth, Scotland|Perth]], the vestments and hangings in Holyrood&lt;ref name="Wormald1991pp57-9"/&gt; and the Medieval maces of the Universities of [[University of St Andrews|St Andrews]] and [[Glasgow university|Glasgow]].&lt;ref name=Webster1997pp127-9/&gt;

===Illumination and painting===
[[File:Trinity Altarpiece.jpg|thumb|left|The [[Trinity Altarpiece]], attributed to Flemish artist [[Hugo van der Goes]] for the [[Trinity College Kirk]] in Edinburgh, Scotland, in the late fifteenth century]]
Manuscript illumination continued into the late Middle Ages, moving from elaborate gospels to charters, like that confirming the rights of [[Kelso Abbey]] from 1159.&lt;ref&gt;R. Brydall, ''Art in Scotland: its Origins and Progress'' (Edinburgh and London: Blackwood, 1889), p. 17.&lt;/ref&gt; Very little painting from Scottish churches survives. There is only one surviving [[Doom painting]] in Scotland, at [[Guthrie, Angus|Guthrie]] near [[Arbroath]], which may have been painted by the same artist as the elaborate crucifixion and other paintings at Foulis Easter, eighteen miles away.&lt;ref&gt;M. R. Apted and W. R.

Wormald, ''Court, Kirk, and Community: Scotland, 1470–1625'' (Edinburgh: Edinburgh University Press, 1991), {{ISBN|0748602763}}, pp. 57–9.&lt;/ref&gt; Much more impressive are the works or artists imported from the continent, particularly the Netherlands, generally considered the centre of painting in the [[Northern Renaissance]].&lt;ref name="Wormald1991pp57-9"/&gt; The products of these connections included a fine portrait of [[William Elphinstone]], [[Bishop of Aberdeen]] (1488–1514);&lt;ref name=Webster1997pp127-9/&gt; the images of St Catherine and St John brought to [[Dunkeld]]; [[Hugo van Der Goes]]'s altarpiece for the [[Trinity College Kirk|Trinity College Church in Edinburgh]], commissioned by [[James III of Scotland|James III]], and the work after which the Flemish [[Master of James IV of Scotland]] is named.&lt;ref name="Wormald1991pp57-9"/&gt; There are also a relatively large number of elaborate devotional books from the late fifteenth and early sixteenth centuries, usually produced in the Low Countries and France for Scottish patrons, including the prayer book commissioned by [[Robert Blackadder]], [[Bishop of Glasgow]], between 1484 and 1492&lt;ref name=Webster1997pp127-9/&gt; and the Flemish illustrated [[book of hours]], known as the [[Hours of James IV of Scotland]], given by [[James IV of Scotland|James IV]] to [[Margaret Tudor]] and described as "perhaps the finest medieval manuscript to have been commissioned for Scottish use".&lt;ref&gt;D.

The '''Bibliography of Music Literature''' ({{lang-de|Bibliographie des Musikschrifttums}}), also known as '''BMS''' or [http://www.musikbibliographie.de:80/LNG=EN/ '''BMS ''online'''''], is an international [[bibliography]] of literature on music. It considers all kind of music and includes both current and older literature. Since 1968, the BMS editorial  staff has been working as the German committee for [[RILM]], too.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rilm.org/globalNetwork/country.php?country=Germany RILM National Committee of Germany]&lt;/ref&gt; The bibliography includes [[monograph]]s, master’s theses and doctoral [[dissertation]]s, articles and reviews from journals, [[Festschrift]]en, [[Proceedings|conference proceedings]], [[yearbook]]s, [[Anthology|anthologies]], and essays from critical reports. It contains [[Printing|printed media]] as well as [[Electronic publishing|online resources]], data media, sound recordings, audiovisual media, and [[microform]]s. Each record provides the title in the original language (for [[Eastern Europe|East European]]- and [[Asia]]n entries a German translation is added), full bibliographic data, a keyword index, and mostly an [[Abstract (summary)|abstract]]. 
Currently, '''BMS ''online''''' has more than 315,000 [[Bibliographic record|records]] of literature on music.&lt;ref&gt;[http://de.wikisource.org/wiki/Musikverzeichnisse#Musikbibliographien Wikisource-Music directories]&lt;/ref&gt; It is supplemented by the [http://uri.gbv.de/database/olcssg-mus '''OLC-SSG Musicology'''], which incorporates the contents of some more 150 music journals from 1993 onward. '''BMS ''online''''' participates actively on [[Virtual Library of Musicology|ViFaMusik]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vifamusik.de/literature.html?L=1&amp;cHash=2d26cd0946314ea51422f6a01ed26e4d BMS ''online'' in the Virtual Library of Musicology]&lt;/ref&gt; the central gateway for music and musicology in Germany.

==Format==

'''BMS''' was established in 1936 by the [[State Institute for Music Research]] in Berlin with the aim to list literature on music from all over the world. It was published in print from 1936 through 1988.&lt;ref&gt;[http://fiz1.fh-potsdam.de/volltext/diplome/05005.pdf Silvia C. E. Mai, ''Anforderung an eine Datenbank im SIM - Staatliches Institut für Musikforschung'', Berlin 2004, p. 4/ p. 11]&lt;/ref&gt; Currently it is available as '''BMS ''online''''' in a [[Online database|cumulative online database]], which is updated in real-time.

==History==

Established in 1936, the '''BMS''' resumed the bibliographic surveys printed in the [https://archive.org/details/jahrbuchdermusi00petegoog '''Jahrbücher der Musikbibliothek Peters''']. The first '''BMS''' editor was [[Kurt Taut]], who was succeeded by [[Georg Karstädt]]. Originally printed by [[Friedrich Hofmeister Musikverlag|Friedrich Hofmeister]] in Leipzig (Leipzig: Hofmeister, 1936-1941 [volumes 1.1936 to 4.1939]), after a span of four years '''BMS''' was stopped due to wartime limitations. The commencement of this bibliographic enterprise after World War II is owed to the musicologist and librarian [[Wolfgang Schmieder]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ub.uni-frankfurt.de/musik/mushist.html Wolfgang Schmieder CV in the University Library of Frankfurt a. Main]&lt;/ref&gt; On behalf of the reconstituted [[State Institute for Music Research]] the first volume for 1950/51 appeared in 1954. Since that time the '''Bibliography of Music Literature''' has been a regular publication of the [[State Institute for Music Research|Staatliches Institut für Musikforschung]]. The last volume in print format was published in 2001 and covered the year 1988 (Frankfurt am Main: [[Friedrich Hofmeister Musikverlag|Hofmeister]], 1954-1968 [volumes 1.1950/51 to 6.1960], Mainz: [[Schott Music|Schott]], 1969-2001 [volumes 1961 to 1988]). Since 2006, there has been the '''Bibliography of Music Literature''' as '''BMS ''online'''''.

'''"Business statistics''' is the science of good decision making in the face of uncertainty and is used in many disciplines such as [[financial analysis]],  [[econometrics]], [[auditing]], production and operations including services improvement and marketing research".&lt;ref&gt;• 
''[[Journal of Business &amp; Economic Statistics]]'', [http://pubs.amstat.org/page/jbes/aims-and-scope Aims and Scope.]{{dead link|date=July 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;br&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;• [http://www.amstat.org/publications/jbes.cfm "''Journal of Business &amp; Economic Statistics'', American Statistical Association."]&lt;/ref&gt;

These sources feature regular repetitive publication of series of data. This makes the topic of [[time series]] especially important for business statistics. It is also a branch of [[applied statistics]] working mostly on data collected as a by-product of doing business or by government agencies. It provides knowledge and skills to interpret and use statistical techniques in a variety of business applications.

A typical business statistics course is intended for [[Business education#Undergraduate education|business majors]], and covers statistical study, descriptive statistics (collection, description, analysis, and summary of data), probability, and the binomial and [[normal distribution]]s, test of hypotheses and confidence intervals, [[linear regression]], and correlation.&lt;ref&gt;• E. Pekoz, ''[[The Manager's Guide to Statistics]]'', http://www.probabilitybookstore.com, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8142">'''The Cambridge English Corpus''' (formerly the Cambridge International Corpus) is a multi-billion word corpus of [[English language]] (containing both [[text corpus]] and spoken corpus data). The Cambridge English Corpus (CEC) contains data from a number of sources including written and spoken, British and American English. The CEC also contains the Cambridge Learner Corpus, a 40m word corpus made up from English exam responses written by English language learners.

The Cambridge English Corpus is used to inform Cambridge University Press [[English Language Teaching]] publications as well as for research in [[corpus linguistics]]. Access is currently restricted to authors and researchers working on projects and publications for [[Cambridge University Press]], and researchers at [[Cambridge English Language Assessment]].&lt;ref&gt;Cambridge International Corpus, http://www.cambridge.org/us/esl/catalog/subject/custom/item3637700/Cambridge-International-Corpus-Cambridge-International-Corpus/?site_locale=en_US&lt;/ref&gt;

== Written Data ==
The Cambridge English Corpus contains instances of modern written English, taken from newspapers, magazines, novels, letters, emails, textbooks, websites, and many other sources.

== Spoken Data ==
The Cambridge English Corpus contains a wide variety of spoken English language, taken from many sources, including everyday conversations, telephone calls, radio broadcasts, presentations, speeches, meetings, TV programmes and lectures.

== Cambridge Learner Corpus ==
The Cambridge Learner Corpus (CLC) is a collection of exam scripts written by students learning English, built in collaboration with Cambridge English Language Assessment. The CLC contains scripts from over 180,000 students, from around 200 countries, speaking 138 different [[first language]]s and is growing all the time.&lt;ref&gt;Cambridge Learner Corpus, http://www.cambridge.org/us/esl/catalog/subject/custom/item3646603/Cambridge-International-Corpus-Cambridge-Learner-Corpus/?site_locale=en_US&lt;/ref&gt; The exams currently included are:

* KET [[Cambridge English: Key (KET)|Key English Test]] (and KET for schools)
* PET [[Preliminary English Test]] (and PET for schools)
* FCE [[First Certificate in English]]
* CAE [[Certificate in Advanced English]]
* CPE [[Certificate of Proficiency in English]]
* BEC [[Business English Certificate]] (all levels)
* IELTS [[International English Language Testing System]] (academic and general training)
* CELS Certificates in English Language Skills
* ILEC International Legal English Certificate
* ICFE International Certificate in Financial English
* Skills for Life

A unique feature of the Cambridge Learner Corpus is its error coding system. Language specialists identify and annotate errors in the exam scripts. This means that the Corpus can be used to find out about the frequency of different types of errors, the contexts that the errors are made in and the student groups that find particular language areas difficult.&lt;ref&gt;Diane Nicholls, http://ucrel.lancs.ac.uk/publications/CL2003/papers/nicholls.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

Authors of Cambridge [[English Language Teaching]] resources can use this information to target common errors – for example, the Cambridge Advanced Learner’s Dictionary contains ‘Common mistake’ features which highlight frequent learner errors.

Conversely, the error coding system also reveals what students can achieve at each level. This is central to the work of [[English Profile]], a collaborative programme to enhance the learning, teaching and assessment of English worldwide.&lt;ref&gt;English Profile project, http://www.englishprofile.org/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=11&amp;Itemid=2&lt;/ref&gt; The founding partners are [[Cambridge University Press]], [[Cambridge English Language Assessment]], the [[University of Cambridge]], the [[University of Bedfordshire]], the [[British Council]] and English UK.&lt;ref&gt;English Profile, http://www.englishprofile.org/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=24&amp;Itemid=22&lt;/ref&gt; The project’s aim is to describe what learners know and can do in English at each level of the [[Common European Framework of Reference]] (CEFR).&lt;ref&gt;Council of Europe, CEFR levels,{{cite web|url=http://www.coe.int/t/dg4/linguistic/CADRE_EN.asp |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-11-05 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091030205032/http://www.coe.int/t/dg4/linguistic/CADRE_EN.asp |archivedate=2009-10-30 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Specialized corpora ==
The Cambridge English Corpus contains a number of specialized corpora:

=== Cambridge Business English Corpus ===
The Cambridge Business English Corpus is a large collection of British and American business language, including reports and documents, books relating to different aspects of business, and the business sections from many national newspapers.

The Cambridge Business English Corpus also includes the '''Cambridge and Nottingham Spoken Business English Corpus''' (CANBEC), the result of a joint project between [[Cambridge University Press]] and the [[University of Nottingham]]. This is a collection of recordings of English from companies of all sizes, ranging from big multinational companies to small partnerships. It contains formal and informal meetings, presentations, telephone conversations, lunchtime conversations, and spoken language from other business situations.

=== Cambridge Legal English Corpus ===
The Cambridge Legal English Corpus contains books, journals and newspaper articles relating to the law and legal processes.

=== Cambridge Financial English Corpus ===
The Cambridge Financial English Corpus contains texts relating to economics and finance, including leading financial magazines and newspapers.

=== Cambridge Academic English Corpus ===
The Cambridge Academic English Corpus contains written and spoken academic language at undergraduate and post-graduate level from a range of US and UK institutions, including lectures, seminars, student presentations, journals, essays and text books.

=== CANCODE ===
The Cambridge and Nottingham Corpus of Discourse in English (CANCODE) is a collection of spoken English recorded at hundreds of locations across the British Isles in a wide variety of situations (e.g. casual conversation, socialising, finding out information, and discussions). The CANCODE corpus is the result of a joint project between [[Cambridge University Press]] and the [[University of Nottingham]].

There are about five million words in the CANCODE corpus, and it's a very rich resource for researchers of spoken English.  However, the data does have some limitations.  Most people knew they were being recorded, and are chatting in informal situations such as while relaxing at home, with others of fairly equal social status.  This means the interactions are generally consensual and collaborative, so the corpus has minimal evidence of conflict or adversarial exchanges&lt;ref&gt;Carter (2004) Language and Creativity: The Art of Common Talk. London: Routledge.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Cambridge-Cornell Corpus of Spoken North American English ===
The Cambridge University Press/Cornell Corpus is a large collection of informal, highly interactive, multiparty conversations between family/friends in North America. The Cambridge-Cornell corpus is the result of a joint project between [[Cambridge University Press]] and [[Cornell University]].

=== CAMSNAE ===
The Cambridge Corpus of Spoken North American English (CAMSNAE) is a large collection of spoken American English. It includes recordings of people going about their everyday life – at work, at home with their families, going shopping, having meals, etc.

'''Cognitive robotics ''' is concerned with endowing a robot with intelligent behavior by providing it with a processing architecture that will allow it to [[Robot learning|learn]] and reason about how to behave in response to complex goals in a complex world. Cognitive robotics may be considered the engineering branch of [[embodied cognitive science]] and [[embodied embedded cognition]].

==Core issues==

While traditional cognitive modeling approaches have assumed symbolic coding schemes as a means for depicting the world, translating the world into these kinds of symbolic representations has proven to be problematic if not untenable. [[philosophy of perception|Perception]] and [[motor cognition|action]] and the notion of [[Mental representation|symbolic representation]] are therefore core issues to be addressed in cognitive robotics.

==Starting point==

Cognitive robotics views animal cognition as a starting point for the development of robotic information processing, as opposed to more traditional [[Artificial Intelligence]] techniques. Target robotic cognitive capabilities include perception processing, attention allocation, [[anticipation (artificial intelligence)|anticipation]], planning, complex motor coordination, reasoning about other agents and perhaps even about their own mental states. Robotic cognition embodies the behavior of [[intelligent agent]]s in the physical world (or a virtual world, in the case of simulated cognitive robotics). Ultimately the robot must be able to act in the real world.

==Learning techniques==

===Motor Babble===
{{main|Motor babbling}}

A preliminary robot learning technique called [[motor babbling]] involves correlating pseudo-random complex motor movements by the robot with resulting visual and/or auditory feedback such that the robot may begin to ''expect'' a pattern of sensory feedback given a pattern of motor output. Desired sensory feedback may then be used to inform a motor control signal. This is thought to be analogous to how a baby learns to reach for objects or learns to produce speech sounds. For simpler robot systems, where for instance inverse kinematics may feasibly be used to transform anticipated feedback (desired motor result) into motor output, this step may be skipped.

===Imitation===

Once a robot can coordinate its motors to produce a desired result, the technique of ''learning by imitation'' may be used. The robot monitors the performance of another agent and then the robot tries to imitate that agent. It is often a challenge to transform imitation information from a complex scene into a desired motor result for the robot. Note that imitation is a high-level form of cognitive behavior and imitation is not necessarily required in a basic model of embodied animal cognition.

===Knowledge acquisition===

A more complex learning approach is "autonomous knowledge acquisition": the robot is left to explore the environment on its own. A system of goals and beliefs is typically assumed.

A somewhat more directed mode of exploration can be achieved by "curiosity" algorithms, such as Intelligent Adaptive Curiosity&lt;ref&gt;http://www.pyoudeyer.com/ims.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.pyoudeyer.com/oudeyer-kaplan-neurorobotics.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; or Category-Based Intrinsic Motivation.&lt;ref&gt;http://science.slc.edu/~jmarshall/papers/cbim-epirob09.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; These algorithms generally involve breaking sensory input into a finite number of categories and assigning some sort of prediction system (such as an [[Artificial Neural Network]]) to each. The prediction system keeps track of the error in its predictions over time. Reduction in prediction error is considered learning. The robot then preferentially explores categories in which it is learning (or reducing prediction error) the fastest.

==Other architectures==

Some researchers in cognitive robotics have tried using architectures such as ([[ACT-R]] and [[Soar (cognitive architecture)]]) as a basis of their cognitive robotics programs. These highly modular symbol-processing architectures have been used to simulate operator performance and human performance when modeling simplistic and symbolized laboratory data. The idea is to extend these architectures to handle real-world sensory input as that input continuously unfolds through time. What is needed is a way to somehow translate the world into a set of symbols and their relationships.

==icb metric systematic manifold== 

drones or subatomic ai are some of the most controversial and greatest representation of sentient robotics and their processing or what the common people refer and believe in as  quantum computing or plutonic A.I. (not to be confused with platonic A.I.) use string theory or mass sentient (sentient, mass) relativity to conduct a universal occlusion called schripp  or string theory using schripp for the general process and purpose of creating A.I. or icb metric drones uses quantum relativity between two units to synchronize and assimilate a wavelength to cause universal fractal hyper conclusion and create an icb3 geometric manifold and conclude computing singularity units 
hypothetically for units to quantum compute icb3 metric numbers and code computers use a conjunction of high pitched AM frequency to randomize photogenic relay combined with a high axis accelerometer with the implementation and use of quantum source code and with inductive relay for reasoning skills that are very close to the geometric decision based system that the human race used for evolution 
inclusively space time to manifold and icb metric singularity are generally heard in a frequency that is beyond the range of human hearing

==Questions==

Some of the fundamental questions to still be answered in cognitive robotics are:
* How much human programming should or can be involved to support the learning processes?
* How can one quantify progress? Some of the adopted ways is the reward and punishment. But what kind of reward and what kind of punishment? In humans, when teaching a child for example, the reward would be candy or some encouragement, and the punishment can take many forms. But what is an effective way with robots?

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3655">The theory of convergence-divergence zones &lt;ref&gt; Kaspar Meyer, Antonio Damasio, Convergence and divergence in a neural architecture for recognition and memory, Trends in Neurosciences Vol.32 No.7, (2009) 376-382&lt;/ref&gt;{{,}}&lt;ref&gt;Antonio Damasio, Time-locked multiregional retroactivation: A systems-level proposal for the neural substrates of recall and recognition, Cognition, 33 (1989) 25-62&lt;/ref&gt;was proposed by [[Antonio Damasio]], in 1989, to explain the neural mechanisms of recollection. It also helps to explain other forms of [[consciousness]]: creative [[imagination]], [[thought]], the formation of beliefs and motivations ...

It is based on two key assumptions: imagination is a simulation of [[perception]], brain registrations of memories are self-excitatory neural networks (neurons can activate each other). 

== Definition ==
A '''convergence-divergence zone''' (CDZ) is a neural network which receives convergent projections from the sites whose activity is to be recorded, and which returns divergent projections to the same sites. When an experiment is recorded, the signals that converge on the CDZ excite their neurons which strengthen their mutual connections (according to the [[Hebbian theory]]) and thus form a self-excitatory network. The excitation of this network is then enough to reproduce the combination of initially received signals. In a self-excitatory network the excitation of a part spreads to all the others, just like a memory fragment awakens an entire recorded experience. A CDZ is thus the place of recording and reproduction of memories. It is both a detector and a signal producer (forms of neuronal activation). This is the basic neural mechanism that explains memories and other forms of imagination.

== Arborescences of CDZ ==
In addition to convergent-divergent paths, a CDZ may be connected to the rest of the brain in every imaginable way, by input signals that activate or inhibit it, and output signals with which it influences the rest of the system. In particular CDZs may be organized into a system and form an arborescence. A CDZ may recruit converging input channels from many other CDZs. It can thus make a synthesis of detection and production capabilities of all the CDZs thus recruited.

To make a model of the CDZ system, we distinguish in the nervous system a peripheral part and a central one, with a gradual progression from the periphery to the center. The periphery includes all sources of perception: the feeling of the outside and inside, emotions and actions. The periphery, thus understood, includes all cortical sensory, emotional and motor areas, and all intracerebral nuclei that contribute to their functioning.

The CDZ system is organized in a hierarchical fashion, from the periphery to the center. The most peripheral CDZs have convergent paths directly from the periphery. We approach the center going up the arborescence of CDZs. One can think of roots that plunge into the earth, the periphery, and converge to the base of the trunk, the center. But in the brain, there are a large number of centers. The most central CDZs have converging projections from other CDZs, and are not recruited by a more central CDZ. The memory of an episode of our life is preserved in such central CDZs. When we relive the perceptions, emotions and actions of a past experience, the excitation of this central CDZs activates all subordinated CDZs and the peripheral areas. It thereby reconstructs the previously lived experience.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4924">A '''critical system''' is a system which must be highly reliable and retain this [[Reliability engineering|reliability]] as they evolve without incurring prohibitive costs.&lt;ref name=lorcan&gt;{{cite journal | first1 = Mike | last1 = Hinchey | first2 = Lorcan | last2 = Coyle | url= https://ulir.ul.ie/bitstream/handle/10344/2085/2010_Hinchey,M.pdf?sequence=2 | title = Evolving Critical Systems: a Research Agenda for Computer-Based Systems | pages = 430-435| year = 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are four types of critical systems: [[safety critical]], [[mission critical]], [[business critical]] and [[security critical]].&lt;ref name=lorcan /&gt;

==General description==

For such systems, trusted methods and techniques must be used for development. Consequently, critical systems are usually developed using well-tested techniques rather than newer techniques that have not been subject to extensive practical experience. Developers of critical systems are naturally conservative, preferring to use older techniques whose strengths and weaknesses are understood, rather than new techniques which may appear to be better, but whose long-term problems are unknown.&lt;ref name=s2007 /&gt;

Expensive software engineering techniques that are not cost-effective for non-critical systems may sometimes be used for critical systems development. For example, [[Formal methods|formal mathematical methods]] of software development have been successfully used for safety and security critical systems. One reason why these formal methods are used is that it helps reduce the amount of testing required. For critical systems, the costs of [[Verification and validation|verification]] and validation are usually very high—more than 50% of the total system development costs.&lt;ref name=s2007 /&gt;

==Classification==

A critical system is distinguished by the consequences associated with system or function failure. Likewise, critical systems are further distinguished between fail-operational and fail safe systems, according to the tolerance they must exhibit to failures:&lt;ref name=marco&gt;{{cite book|first1=Marco|last1=Bozzano|first2=Adolfo|last2=Villafiorita|title=Design and Safety Assessment of Critical Systemss|location=Austin, Texas|year=2010|url=https://www.crcpress.com/Design-and-Safety-Assessment-of-Critical-Systems/Bozzano-Villafiorita/p/book/9781439803318|pages=298|isbn=9781439803318|publisher=Auerbach Publications}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Fail-operational — typically required to operate not only in nominal conditions (expected), but also in degraded situations when some parts are not working properly. For example, airplanes are fail-operational because they must be able to fly even if some components fail.
* Fail-safe — must safely shut down in case of single or multiple failures. Trains are fail-safe systems because stopping a train is typically sufficient to put into safe state.

===Safety critical===
{{main|Life-critical system}}
''Safety critical'' systems deal with scenarios that may lead to loss of life, serious personal injury, or damage to the natural environment. Examples of safety-critical systems are a control system for a chemical manufacturing plant, aircraft, the controller of an unmanned train metro system, a controller of a nuclear plant, etc.&lt;ref name=s2007&gt;{{cite web|title=Mission Critical vs. Business Critical: HUH?|url=http://www.activestate.com/blog/2010/03/mission-critical-vs-business-critical-applications-huh|website=Activestate ActiveBlog}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=lorcan /&gt;&lt;ref name=marco /&gt;

===Mission critical===
{{main|Mission critical}}
''Mission critical'' systems are made to avoid inability to complete the overall system, project objectives or one of the goals for which the system was designed. Examples of mission-critical systems are a navigational system for a spacecraft, software controlling a [[baggage handling system]] of an airport, etc.&lt;ref name=s2007 /&gt;&lt;ref name=lorcan /&gt;&lt;ref name=marco /&gt;

===Business critical===
''Business critical'' systems are programmed to avoid significant tangible or intangible economic costs; e.g., loss of business or damage to reputation. This is often due to the interruption of service caused by the system being unusable. Examples of a business-critical systems are the customer accounting system in a bank, stock-trading system, [[ERP system]] of a company, Internet search engine, etc.&lt;ref name=s2007 /&gt;&lt;ref name=lorcan /&gt;&lt;ref name=marco /&gt;

===Security critical===
''Security critical'' systems deal with the loss of sensitive data through theft or accidental loss.&lt;ref name=lorcan /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4219">'''Croatian National Corpus''' ({{lang-hr|Hrvatski nacionalni korpus}}, ''HNK'') is the biggest and the most important corpus of the [[Croatian language]]. Its compilation started in 1998 at the Institute of Linguistics&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ffzg.hr/zzl Institute of Linguistics]&lt;/ref&gt; of the [[Faculty of Humanities and Social Sciences, University of Zagreb|Faculty of Humanities and Social Sciences]], [[University of Zagreb]] following the ideas of  [http://hnk.ffzg.hr/mt Marko Tadić]. The theoretical foundations and the expression of the need for a general-purpose, representative and multi-million corpus of the Croatian language started to appear even earlier.&lt;ref&gt;Tadić 1990, [http://www.hnk.ffzg.hr/txts/mt4hnk.pdf 1996], [http://www.hnk.ffzg.hr/txts/mt4hnk2.pdf 1998]&lt;/ref&gt; The Croatian National Corpus is compiled from selected texts written in Croatian covering all fields, topics, genres and styles: from literary and scientific texts to text-books, newspaper, user-groups and chat rooms.

The initial composition was divided in two constituents:
# ''30-million corpus of contemporary Croatian language'' (30m) where samples from texts from 1990 on were included. The criteria for inclusion of text samples were: written by native speakers, different fields, genres and topics. Translated text or poetry were excluded.
# ''Croatian Electronic Text Archive'' (HETA) where the complete text were included, particularly serial publications (volumes, series, editions etc.) which would imbalance the 30m if they were inserted there.

Since 2004, with the adoption of the concept of the 3rd generation corpus, the two-constituent structure has been abandoned in favor of several subcorpora and larger size. Since 2005 HNK 105 million tokens and is composed of number of different subcorpora which can be searched individually and all together in a whole corpus. Since 2004 HNK also migrated to a new server platform, namely Manatee/Bonito server-client architecture. For searching the HNK (today still with free test access) a free client program Bonito&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.textforge.cz Bonito]&lt;/ref&gt; is needed.

[[Image:2008-11-20 North Pointe Commons front gate.jpg|thumb|250px|Electric security gates at an apartment complex in [[Durham, North Carolina]].]]

An '''electric gate''' is an entrance [[gate]] which can be opened and closed via an electric powered [[Mechanism (engineering)|mechanism]].

==Electric Gate Options==
[[File:Sliding electric gate-001.JPG|thumb|A sliding electric gate with electric motor and backup battery in case of mains failure. Note also the Infrared obstacle [[sensor]] located on the wall to prevent the gate from closing while a vehicle or other obstacle is in the way.]]
The most popular electric gates for residential properties are swing gates, but these are not the only option available.{{citation needed|date=November 2012}}

===Articulated===
Articulated gate openers can be used for gates with wide posts allowing opening in small spaces. An easy system for DIY installers  as they are simple to install but not as aesthetically pleasing as other motor designs. Also known as Crank arm operators, they are the main type of automation system sold in France, where low aluminium gates are often used.

===Underground===
Under-gate Jack operators usually control the gate by directly moving the pivot point of each gate leaf. This makes the unit ideal cosmetically and also allows for up to 180 degrees of leaf swing as required. However controlling the pivot point of the gate, is like opening a door by twisting the hinge, and as so is very difficult due to the loads needed at that point. This is highlighted with snap, as the gate has to change direct, as soon as it can. For this reason they are recommend as only suitable for ‘Domestic’ systems in a low risk of abuse environment. Another major consideration with the use of under-gate units is that of water immersion/ingress and warranty voidance. If the water table is high or the drainage of the unit’s foundation box inadequate throughout the systems life, then water ingress and unit failure is increased.

Ram or link arm units are usually simpler to install and maintain, they are visible to otherwise ignorant abuse and as they fix down along each gate leaf, they also have an obvious and sometimes major, mechanical advantage over Jacks. Therefore, Rams are far more suitable on Multi-user &amp; commercial systems. Also the manual release is always above ground, making it often more user friendly in operation.

===Sliding===
If space is an issue or the driveway behind the gates is on a steep incline, a better option would be a sliding gate. Sliding gates are also very popular in a commercial environment.
Sliding gates are also used for cantillever gate systems.

==Electric Gate History==
The first commercial electric gate systems were hydraulic and designed for reliability and ease of use. The cost of the hydraulic systems however meant that other companies started producing more affordable electromechanical alternatives.  Hydraulic motors are the preferred choice on large and heavy gates as they can generate high levels of torque, electromechanical systems designed for lower usage domestic installations because they can be produced more cost effectively. A number of larger manufacturers now produce both hydraulic and electromechanical systems providing unbiased choice for customers.

==The Electric Gate Motor==
The backbone of any electric gate, whether automatic or not, is the electric gate motor, two distinct motor types exist hydraulic, or electromechanical. This is the electric device which actually enables the electric gate to open and close without having to manually push the gate. All types of electric gates and barriers make use of a motor of some kind. There are many different kinds of electric gate motors offered by a number of automation companies most located in Italie .

==Electric Gate Safety==
The safety of an automated gate is an important consideration, in the European Union, automated gate safety is specified by a series of European Normalisations. An automated gate that has not been fitted with safety in mind can potentially become a major hazard particularly to untrained users. Various safety devices are available to make sure that your gates meet the highest of European or American safety standards.

==Gate and Security==
Electric gates alone, however solid and imposing they may be, cannot guarantee a completely [[secure environment]] electric locks, are often needed to boost the locking effectiveness of the gate motors. Electric gates are recommended to be used in combination with other security features to install a full [[Burglar alarm|security system]]. A few of these features are closed circuits with [[Closed-circuit television|security cameras]], additional gates in conjunction with the main gate, electronic keycards and keypads, [[security guard]]s.

Aside from the additional security features that should go with parking barrier gates, electric security gates often offer safety features like [[sensors]] that determine when there is an obstruction to prevent the electronic gate from swinging into a vehicle or closing on somebody's [[hands]]. To prevent the electronic gates from being damaged by irresponsible drivers driving fast [[speed bump]]s are also commonly placed before gate entrances to slow down vehicles.

==Safety Regulations in Europe==
All installations must meet with the Machinery directive 2006/42/EC with EN13241-1 being the regulations concerning gates. The installer of the gate is responsible for the conformity to regulation, not the manufacturer. The two main EN regulations that then apply are EN 12453 which describes the safety levels that should be observed when installing a gate and EN12445 which describes the testing method that must be undertaken. 
The major points are the maximum amount of force at certain test points. Example - a maximum of 400N of force can be applied in the last 50, 300 and 500&amp;nbsp;mm of travel of a gate, after the initial impact the force must drop to 150N within 0.75 of a second and reduce to 25N within 5 seconds.  During the mid travel of a gate the allowable force is 1400N. 
A full risk assessment of the gates must take place with all crush, cutting points shown to the client with appropriate protection devices offered, a recommended maintenance program should also be provided. Finally the installer must confirm that all electrical equipment fitted has the European CE mark all the time.

To conform to these regulations the gate system must be checked with a calibrated force tester and the full results kept in a technical file for 7 years. If the gate is not tested it does not comply.
Most gate kits can be fitted with safety equipment so that these limits are achieved and so cover that part of EN13241-1.

Two recent incidents in the UK when children were killed by sliding gates have resulted in the UK Health and Safety department issuing a Gate Safety Bulletin.&lt;ref name="Safety-bulletin"&gt;[http://www.hse.gov.uk/safetybulletins/electricgates2.htm Electric Gate Safety]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Explosionproof inspection lamp MESC 69.68.10.002.1.JPG|thumb|right| This inspection lamp is constructed so that it cannot set off an explosion when surrounded by specified flammable gases or dust.]]
In [[electrical engineering]], '''hazardous locations''' (sometimes abbreviated to '''HazLoc''', pronounced ''Haz·Lōk'') are defined as places where fire or explosion hazards may exist due to flammable gases, flammable liquid–produced vapors, combustible liquid–produced vapors, combustible dusts, or ignitable fibers/flyings present in the air in quantities sufficient to produce explosive or ignitable mixtures.&lt;ref&gt;Article 500 of the National Electrical Code (NEC), NFPA 70&lt;/ref&gt; Electrical equipment that must be installed in such classified locations should be specially designed and tested to ensure it does not initiate an explosion, due to [[electrical arc|arc]]ing contacts or high surface temperature of equipment.

The introduction of electrical apparatus for signaling or lighting in coal mines was accompanied by electrically-initiated explosions of flammable gas and dust. Technical standards were developed to identify the features of electrical apparatus that would prevent electrical initiation of explosions due to energy or thermal effects. Several physical methods of protection are used. The apparatus may be designed to prevent entry of flammable gas or dust into the interior. The apparatus may be strong enough to contain and cool any combustion gases produced internally. Or, electrical devices may be designed so that they cannot produce a spark strong enough or temperatures high enough to ignite a specified hazardous gas. Integrating these types of motors can ensure that equipment, facilities, and workers stay protected and machinery is not damaged.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.dietzelectric.com/hazard-loc.php|title=Hazardous Location Motors - Dietz Electric|website=www.dietzelectric.com|language=en|access-date=2018-04-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Electrical ignition hazard==
A household [[light switch]] may emit a small, harmless visible spark when switching. In an ordinary atmosphere this arc is of no concern, but if a flammable vapor is present, the arc might start an explosion. Electrical equipment intended for use in a [[chemical industry|chemical factory]] or [[oil refinery|refinery]] either is designed to contain any explosion within the device or is designed not to produce sparks with sufficient energy to trigger an explosion.

Many strategies exist for safety in electrical installations.  The simplest strategy is to minimize the amount of electrical equipment installed in a hazardous area, either by keeping the equipment out of the area altogether or by making the area less hazardous by process improvements or ventilation with clean air. [[Intrinsic safety]], or non-incendive equipment and wiring methods, is a set of practices for apparatus designed with low power levels and low stored energy. Insufficient energy is available to produce an arc that can ignite the surrounding explosive mixture. Equipment enclosures can be pressurized with clean air or inert gas and designed with various controls to remove power or provide notification in case of supply or pressure loss of such gases. Arc-producing elements of the equipment can also be isolated from the surrounding atmosphere by encapsulation, immersion in oil, sand, etc. Heat producing elements such as motor winding, electrical heaters, including heat tracing and lighting fixtures are often designed to limit their maximum temperature below the autoignition temperature of the material involved. Both external and internal temperatures are taken into consideration.

As in most fields of electrical installation, different countries have approached the standardization and testing of equipment for hazardous areas in different ways. As world trade becomes more important in distribution of electrical products, international standards are slowly converging so that a wider range of acceptable techniques can be approved by national regulatory agencies.

Area classification is required  by governmental bodies, for example by the U.S. [[Occupational Safety and Health Administration]] and compliance is enforced.

Documentation requirements are varied. Often an area classification plan-view is provided to identify equipment ratings  and installation techniques to be used for each classified plant area. The plan may contain the list of chemicals with their group and temperature rating, and elevation details shaded to indicate Class, Division(Zone) and group combination. The area classification process would require the participation of operations, maintenance, safety, electrical and instrumentation professionals, the use of process diagrams and material flows, [[MSDS]] and any pertinent documents, information and knowledge to determine the hazards and their extent and the countermeasures to be employed. Area classification documentations are reviewed and updated to reflect process changes.

==History==
Soon after the introduction of electric power into [[coal mining|coal mine]]s, it was discovered that lethal explosions could be initiated by electrical equipment such as lighting, signals, or motors.  The hazard of [[fire damp]] or methane accumulation in mines was well known by the time electricity was introduced, along with the danger of suspended coal dust. At least two British mine explosions were attributed to an electric bell signal system. In this system, two bare wires were run along the length of a drift, and any miner desiring to signal the surface would momentarily touch the wires to each other or bridge the wires with a metal tool. The [[inductance]] of the signal bell coils, combined with breaking of contacts by exposed metal surfaces, resulted in sparks which could ignite methane, causing an explosion.&lt;ref&gt;Bossert 86 page 17&lt;/ref&gt;

In an industrial plant such as a [[Refining|refinery]] or [[chemical plant]], handling of large quantities of flammable liquids and gases creates a risk of leaks.  In some cases the gas, ignitable vapor or dust is present all the time or for long periods. Other areas would have a dangerous concentration of flammable substances only during process upsets, equipment deterioration between maintenance periods, or during an incident. Refineries and chemical plants are then divided into areas of risk of release of gas, vapor or dust known as divisions or zones.

The process of determining the type and size of these hazardous areas is called area classification. Guidance on assessing the extent of the hazard is given in the NFPA 497 or NFPA 499 standards published by the [[National Fire Protection Association]] for explosive gas or dust atmospheres respectively, or RP 500 and RP 505 standards published by the [[American Petroleum Institute]] for explosive gas or dust atmospheres respectively, and IEC 60079-10-1 or IEC 60079-10-2 standards published by the [[International Electrotechnical Commission]] for explosive gas or dust atmospheres respectively.

== Division and Zone classification systems ==
The [[National_Electrical_Code|National Electric Code (NEC), NFPA 70]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nfpa.org/aboutthecodes/AboutTheCodes.asp?DocNum=70 |title=NFPA 70, National Electric Code |publisher=National Fire Protection Association}}&lt;/ref&gt; as published by the [[National Fire Protection Association]], defines area classification and installation principles.  The principles of the NEC Division and Zone classification systems are applied in countries around the globe, such as in the United States.

Specifically, Article 500 describes the NEC Division classification system, while Articles 505 and 506 describe the NEC Zone classification system. The NEC Zone classification system was created to provide multinational companies with a system that could be harmonized with IEC classification system and therefore reduce the complexity of management.

Canada has a similar system with the [[Canadian Electrical Code]] defining area classification and installation principles.  Two possible classifications are described in [[Canadian Standards Association]] (CSA) C22.1 Canadian Electrical Code (CEC) Section 18 (Zones) and Appendix J (Divisions).

===Explosive gas area classifications===
Typical gas hazards are from hydrocarbon compounds, but hydrogen and ammonia are common industrial gases that are flammable.

;Class I, Division 1 classified locations: An area where ignitable concentrations of flammable gases, vapors or liquids can exist all of the time or some of the time under normal operating conditions. A Class I, Division 1 area encompasses the combination of Zone 0 and Zone 1 areas.

;Zone 0 classified locations: An area where ignitable concentrations of flammable gases, vapors or liquids are present continuously or for long periods of time under normal operating conditions. An example of this would be the vapor space above the liquid in the top of a tank or drum. The ANSI/NEC classification method consider this environment a Class I, Division 1 area. As a guide for Zone 0, this can be defined as over 1000 hours/year or &gt;10% of the time.&lt;ref name=hse_uk_gov/&gt;

;Zone 1 classified location: An area where ignitable concentrations of flammable gases, vapors or liquids are likely to exist under normal operating conditions. As a guide for Zone 1, this can be defined as 10–1000 hours/year or 0.1–10% of the time.&lt;ref name=hse_uk_gov/&gt;

;Class I, Division 2 or Zone 2 classified locations: An area where ignitable concentrations of flammable gases, vapors or liquids are not likely to exist under normal operating conditions. In this area the gas, vapor or liquids would only be present under abnormal conditions (most often leaks under abnormal conditions). As a general guide for Zone 2, unwanted substances should only be present under 10 hours/year or 0–0.1% of the time.&lt;ref name=hse_uk_gov&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.hse.gov.uk/comah/sragtech/techmeasareaclas.htm| title=Hazardous Area Classification and Control of Ignition Sources| publisher=UK Health and Safety Executive| date=22 September 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

;Unclassified locations: Also known as non-hazardous or ordinary locations, these locations are determined to be neither Class I, Division 1 or Division 2; Zone 0, Zone 1 or Zone 2; or any combination thereof. Such areas include a residence or office where the only risk of a release of explosive or flammable gas would be such things as the propellant in an [[aerosol spray]]. The only explosive or flammable liquid would be paint and brush cleaner. These are designated as very low risk of causing an explosion and are more of a fire risk (although gas explosions in residential buildings do occur). Unclassified locations on chemical and other plant are present where it is absolutely certain that the hazardous gas is diluted to a concentration below 25% of its lower [[flammability limit]] (or lower explosive limit (LEL)).

===Explosive dust area classifications===
[[File:Grain silo explosion.jpg|thumb|right|An explosion of dust at this [[grain elevator]] in Kansas killed five workers in 1998.]]
Flammable [[dust]]s when suspended in air can explode. An old system of area classification to a British standard used a system of letters to designate the zones. This has been replaced by a European numerical system, as set out in directive 1999/92/EU implemented in the UK as the Dangerous Substances and Explosives Atmospheres Regulations 2002

The boundaries and extent of these hazardous locations should be decided by a competent person. There must be a site plan drawn up of the factory with the divisions or zones marked on.

NEC:
;Class II, Division 1 classified locations: An area where ignitable concentrations of combustible dust can exist all of the time or some of the time under normal operating conditions.

;Class II, Division 2 classified locations: An area where ignitable concentrations of combustible dust are not likely to exist under normal operating conditions.

;Class III, Division 1 classified locations: An area where easily ignitable fibers or materials producing combustible flyings are handled, manufactured or used.

;Class III, Division 2 classified locations: An area where easily ignitable fibers are stored or handled.

Outside America:
;Zone 20 classified locations: An area where ignitable concentrations of combustible dust or ignitable fibers/flyings are present continuously or for long periods of time under normal operating conditions.

;Zone 21 classified location: An area where ignitable concentrations of combustible dust or ignitable fibers/flyings are likely to exist under normal operating conditions.

;Zone 22 classified locations: An area where ignitable concentrations of combustible dust or ignitable fibers/flyings are not likely to exist under normal operating conditions.

;Unclassified locations: Also known as non-hazardous or ordinary locations, these locations are determined to be neither Class II, Division 1 or Division 2; Class III, Division 1 or Division 2; Zone 20, Zone 21 or Zone 22; or any combination thereof.

==Gas and dust groups==
Explosive atmospheres have different chemical properties that affect the likelihood and severity of an explosion. Such properties include flame temperature, minimum ignition energy, upper and lower explosive limits, and molecular weight. Empirical testing is done to determine parameters such as the [[Maximum Experimental Safe Gap|maximum experimental safe gap]] (MESG), minimum igniting current (MIC) ratio, explosion pressure and time to peak pressure, spontaneous ignition temperature, and maximum rate of pressure rise. Every substance has a differing combination of properties but it is found that they can be ranked into similar ranges, simplifying the selection of equipment for hazardous areas.&lt;ref name=Bossert86&gt;John Bossert and Randolph Hurst, ''Hazardous Locations A Guide for the Design, Construction and Installation of Electrical Equipment'', Canadian Standards Association, Toronto 1986 {{ISBN|0-9690124-5-4}}, Chapter 9
&lt;/ref&gt;

Flammability of combustible liquids are defined by their flash-point. The flash-point is the temperature at which the material will generate sufficient quantity of vapor to form an ignitable mixture. The flash point determines if an area needs to be classified. A material may have a relatively low autoignition temperature yet if its flash-point is above the ambient temperature, then the area may not need to be classified. Conversely if the same material is heated and handled above its flash-point, the area must  be classified for proper electrical system design, as it will then form an ignitable mixture.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://iaeimagazine.org/magazine/2014/11/10/hazardous-classified-locations-nec-articles-500-through-517/|title=Hazardous (Classified) Locations — NEC Articles 500 through 517 {{!}} IAEI Magazine|date=2014-11-10|work=IAEI Magazine|access-date=2018-04-04|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Each chemical gas or vapour used in industry is classified into a gas group.

Group IIC is the most severe Zone system gas group.  Hazards in this group gas can be ignited very easily indeed. Equipment marked as suitable for Group IIC is also suitable for IIB and IIA. Equipment marked as suitable for IIB is also suitable for IIA but NOT for IIC. If equipment is marked, for example, Ex e II T4 then it is suitable for all subgroups IIA, IIB and IIC

A list must be drawn up of every explosive material that is on the refinery/chemical complex and included in the site plan of the classified areas. The above groups are formed in order of how explosive the material would be if it was ignited, with IIC being the most explosive Zone system gas group and IIA being the least. The groups also indicate how much energy is required to ignite the material by energy or thermal effects, with IIA requiring the most energy and IIC the least for Zone system gas groups.

== Temperature classification ==

Another important consideration is the temperature classification of the electrical equipment. The surface temperature or any parts of the electrical equipment that may be exposed to the hazardous atmosphere should be tested that it does not exceed 80% of the auto-ignition temperature of the specific gas or vapor in the area where the equipment is intended to be used.

The temperature classification on the electrical equipment label will be one of the following (in [[degree Celsius]]):

{|class="wikitable"
!colspan="2" | USA °C!! International&lt;br&gt;(IEC) °C!! Germany °C&lt;br&gt;Continuous - Short Time
|-
| T1  - 450 || T3A - 180 || T1 - 450 || align="center" | G1: 360 - 400
|-
| T2  - 300 || T3B - 165 || T2 - 300 || align="center" | G2: 240 - 270
|-
| T2A - 280 || T3C - 160 || T3 - 200 || align="center"| G3: 160 - 180
|-
| T2B - 260 || T4  - 135 || T4 - 135 || align="center"| G4: 110 - 125
|-
| T2C - 230 || T4A - 120 || T5 - 100 || align="center"| G5: 80  -  90
|-
| T2D - 215 || T5  - 100 || T6 - 85
|-
| T3  - 200 || T6  -  85 || &amp;nbsp;
|}

The above table tells us that the surface temperature of a piece of electrical equipment with a temperature classification of T3 will not rise above 200&amp;nbsp;°C.

=== Auto-ignition temperatures  ===
The auto-ignition temperature of a liquid, gas or vapor is the lowest temperature at atmospheric pressure at which the substance will ignite without any external heat source, such as a spark or flame. This is used for classification of temperature class for industry and technology applications.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ozm.cz/en/autoignition-temperature-of-liquid-ait-551/|title=Autoignition temperature of liquid|last=Research|first=OZM|website=www.ozm.cz|access-date=2018-04-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; The exact temperature value determined depends on the laboratory test conditions and apparatus.  Such temperatures for common substances are:
{|class="wikitable"
! Gas
! Temperature
|-
| [[Methane]] || 580&amp;nbsp;°C
|-
| [[Hydrogen]] || 560&amp;nbsp;°C
|-
| [[Propane]] || 493&amp;nbsp;°C
|-
| [[Ethylene]] || 425&amp;nbsp;°C
|-
| [[Acetylene]] || 305&amp;nbsp;°C
|-
| [[Naphtha]] || 290&amp;nbsp;°C
|-
|[[Carbon disulfide]]||102&amp;nbsp;°C
|}

The surface of a high pressure steam pipe may be above the autoignition temperature of some fuel/air mixtures.

=== Auto-ignition temperatures (dust) ===
The auto-ignition temperature of a dust is usually higher than that of vapours &amp; gases. Examples for common materials are:

{|class="wikitable"
! Substance
! Temperature
|-
| [[Sugar]] || 460&amp;nbsp;°C
|-
| [[Wood]] || 340&amp;nbsp;°C
|-
| [[Flour]] || 340&amp;nbsp;°C
|-
| [[Grain]] || 300&amp;nbsp;°C
|-
| [[Tea]] || 300&amp;nbsp;°C
|}

==Type of protection==

To ensure safety in a given situation, equipment is placed into protection level categories according to manufacture method and suitability for different situations. Category 1 is the highest safety level and Category 3 the lowest. Although there are many types of protection, a few are detailed

{|class="wikitable"

  | Equipment construction is such that it can withstand an internal explosion and provide relief of the external pressure via flamegap(s) such as the labyrinth created by threaded fittings or machined flanges. The escaping (hot) gases must sufficiently cool down along the escape path that by the time they reach the outside of the enclosure not to be a source of ignition of the outside, potentially ignitable surroundings.&lt;br/&gt;

The types of protection are subdivided into several sub classes, linked to EPL: ma and mb, px, py and pz, ia, ib and ic.
The a subdivisions have the most stringent safety requirements, taking into account more the one independent component faults simultaneously.

===Multiple protection===

Many items of EEx rated equipment will employ more than one method of protection in different components of the apparatus. These would be then labeled with each of the individual methods. For example, a socket outlet labeled EEx'de' might have a case made to EEx 'e' and switches that are made to EEx 'd'.

==Equipment protection level==

In recent years also the Equipment Protection Level (EPL) is specified for several kinds of protection. The required Protection level is linked to the intended use in the zones described below:

{|class="wikitable"

|}

== Equipment category ==

The equipment category indicates the level of protection offered by the equipment.
* Category 1 equipment may be used in zone 0, zone 1 or zone 2 areas.
* Category 2 equipment may be used in zone 1 or zone 2 areas.
* Category 3 equipment may only be used in zone 2 areas.

== Labeling ==

All equipment certified for use in hazardous areas must be labelled to show the type and level of protection applied.

===Europe===
[[File:EX-logo.svg|thumb|right|Mark for ATEX certified electrical equipment for explosive atmospheres.]] 
In Europe the label must show the [[CE mark]] and the code number of the certifying body ([[Notified Body]]). The CE marking is complemented with the Ex mark, followed by the indication of the Group, Category and, if group II equipment, the indication relating to gases (G) or dust (D). For example: Ex II 1 G (Explosion protected, Group 2, Category 1, Gas) Specific type or types of protection being used will be marked.
*Ex ia IIC T4. (Type ia, Group 2C gases, Temperature class 4).
*Ex nA II T3 X (Type n, non-sparking, Group 2 gases, Temperature class 3, special conditions apply).

Industrial electrical equipment for hazardous area has to conform to appropriate parts of standard [https://www.iecex.com/publications/standards/ IEC 60079] for gas hazards, and [https://www.iecex.com/publications/standards/ IEC 61241] for dust hazards, and in some cases, be certified as meeting that standard. Independent test houses (known as [[Notified_Body|Notified Bodies]]) are established in most European countries, and a certificate from any of these will be accepted across the EU. In the United Kingdom,  the DTI appoint and maintain a [http://www.berr.gov.uk/files/file44775.pdf list of Notified Bodies within the UK], of which [[Sira (group of British companies)|Sira]] and [[Baseefa]] are the most well known.

Australia and New Zealand use the same IEC 60079 standards (Adopted as AS/NZS 60079) however the CE mark is not required.

===North America===
In North America the suitability of equipment for the specific hazardous area must be tested by a [[Nationally Recognized Testing Laboratories|Nationally Recognized Testing Laboratory]]. Such institutes are [[UL (safety organization)|UL]], [http://www.metlabs.com/ MET], [[FM Global|FM]], [[Canadian Standards Association|CSA]] or [[Intertek]] (ETL), for example.

The label will always list the Class(es), Division(s) and may list the Group(s) and temperature Code. Directly adjacent on the label one will find the mark of the listing agency.

Some manufacturers claim "suitability" or "built-to" hazardous areas in their technical literature, but in effect lack the testing agency's certification and thus unacceptable for the AHJ ([[Authority Having Jurisdiction]]) to permit operation of the electrical installation/system.

All equipment in Division 1 areas must have an approval label, but certain materials, such as rigid metallic conduit, does not have a specific label indicating the Cl./Div.1 suitability and their listing as approved method of installation in the NEC serves as the permission.  Some equipment in Division 2 areas do not require a specific label, such as standard 3 phase induction motors that do not contain normally arcing components.

Also included in the marking are the manufacturers name or trademark and address, the apparatus type, name and serial number, year of manufacture and any special conditions of use. The NEMA enclosure rating or [[IP code]] may also be indicated, but it is usually independent of the Classified Area suitability.

[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 101I-635-3966-27, Panzerfabrik in Deutschland.jpg|thumb|During [[World War II]], production of German tanks such as the [[Panther tank|Panther]] was accurately estimated by Allied intelligence using statistical methods]]
In the [[statistical theory]] of [[estimation theory|estimation]], the '''German tank problem''' consists in estimating the maximum of a [[discrete uniform distribution]] from [[sampling without replacement]]. In simple terms, suppose we have an unknown number of items which are sequentially numbered from 1 to ''N''. We take a random sample of these items and observe their sequence numbers; the problem is to estimate ''N'' from these observed numbers. 

The problem is named after its application by Allied forces in [[World War II]] to the estimation of the monthly rate of German tank production from a paucity (statistically speaking) of sampled data.  This exploited the manufacturing practice of assigning ascending sequences of serial numbers to tank components (chassis, gearbox, engine, wheels) — which were captured in battle by Allied forces.

The problem can be approached using either [[frequentist inference]] or [[Bayesian inference]], achieving different results. Estimating the population maximum based on a ''single'' sample yields divergent results, whereas estimation based on ''multiple'' samples is a practical estimation question whose answer is simple (especially in the frequentist setting) but not obvious (especially in the Bayesian setting).

==Suppositions==

The adversary is presumed to have manufactured a series of tanks marked with consecutive whole numbers, beginning with serial number 1.  Additionally, regardless of a tank's date of manufacture, history of service, or the serial number it bears, the distribution over serial numbers becoming revealed to analysis is uniform, up to the point in time when the analysis is conducted.

==Example==

[[File:German_tank_problem_graphs.svg|thumb|Graphs of estimated population size, ''N'' for number of samples, ''k'' and largest sample serial number, ''m'' using frequentist (dotted lines) and Bayesian analysis (solid line shows mean and shading shows range from minimum possible value to mean plus 1 standard deviation). The example shows if 4 tanks are observed and the highest serial number is 60, frequentist analysis predicts ''N'' = 74 whereas Bayesian analysis predicts a mean of 88.5 and standard deviation of 138.72 &amp;minus; 88.5 = 50.22, and a minimum of 60 tanks. In [http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/3e/German_tank_problem_graphs.svg the SVG file], hover over a graph to highlight it.]]
Suppose {{nowrap|''k'' {{=}} 4}} tanks with serial numbers 19, 40, 42 and 60 are captured. The maximal observed serial number, {{nowrap|''m'' {{=}} 60}}. The unknown total number of tanks is called ''N''.

The formula for estimating the total number of tanks suggested by the ''frequentist'' approach outlined below is

:&lt;math&gt;N \approx m + \frac{m}{k} - 1 = 74,&lt;/math&gt;

whereas the ''Bayesian'' analysis below yields (primarily) a [[probability mass function]] for the number of tanks

:&lt;math&gt;\Pr(N=n) = \begin{cases}
   0 &amp;\text{if } n &lt; m \\
   \frac {k - 1}{k}\frac{\binom{m - 1}{k - 1}}{\binom n k} &amp;\text{if } n \ge m,
\end{cases}&lt;/math&gt;

from which we can estimate the number of tanks according to

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}

This distribution has positive [[skewness]], related to the fact that there are at least 60 tanks.

==Historical problem==
[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 183-H26258, Panzer V "Panther".jpg|thumb|right|Panther tanks are loaded for transport to frontline units, 1943]]
During the course of the war, the [[Allies of World War II|Western Allies]] made sustained efforts to determine the extent of German production and approached this in two major ways: conventional intelligence gathering and statistical estimation.  In many cases, statistical analysis substantially improved on conventional intelligence.  In some cases, conventional intelligence was used in conjunction with statistical methods, as was the case in estimation of [[German tanks in World War II|Panther tank]] production just prior to [[D-Day]].

The allied command structure had thought the [[Panzer V]] (Panther) tanks seen in Italy, with their high velocity, long-barreled 75&amp;nbsp;mm/L70 guns, were unusual heavy tanks and would only be seen in northern France in small numbers, much the same way as the [[Tiger I]] was seen in Tunisia. The US Army was confident that the [[Sherman tank]] would continue to perform well, as it had versus the [[Panzer III]] and [[Panzer IV]] tanks in North Africa and Sicily.{{refn|An Armored Ground Forces policy statement of November 1943 concluded: "The recommendation of a limited proportion of tanks carrying a 90 mm gun is not concurred in for the following reasons: The M4 tank has been hailed widely as the best tank of the battlefield today. ... There appears to be no fear on the part of our forces of the German Mark VI (Tiger) tank.  There can be no basis for the T26 tank other than the conception of a tank-vs.-tank duel – which is believed to be unsound and unnecessary."&lt;ref&gt;AGF policy statement.  Chief of staff AGF. November 1943. MHI&lt;/ref&gt;|group=N}} Shortly before D-Day, rumors indicated that large numbers of Panzer V tanks were being used.

To determine whether this was true, the Allies attempted to estimate the number of tanks being produced.  To do this, they used the serial numbers on captured or destroyed tanks. The principal numbers used were gearbox numbers, as these fell in two unbroken sequences. Chassis and engine numbers were also used, though their use was more complicated.  Various other components were used to cross-check the analysis. Similar analyses were done on wheels, which were observed to be sequentially numbered (i.e., 1,&amp;nbsp;2,&amp;nbsp;3,&amp;nbsp;...,&amp;nbsp;''N'').{{sfn|Ruggles|Brodie|1947|p=?}}{{efn|The lower bound was unknown, but to simplify the discussion, this detail is generally omitted, taking the lower bound as known to be 1.}}&lt;ref name=Davies-2006-07-20&gt;

The analysis of tank wheels yielded an estimate for the number of wheel molds that were in use.  A discussion with British road wheel makers then estimated the number of wheels that could be produced from this many molds, which yielded the number of tanks that were being produced each month.  Analysis of wheels from two tanks (32 road wheels each, 64 road wheels total) yielded an estimate of 270 tanks produced in February 1944, substantially more than had previously been suspected.&lt;ref name="Carruthers"&gt;

German records after the war showed production for the month of February 1944 was 276.{{sfn|Ruggles|Brodie|1947|pp=82–83}}{{refn|Ruggles &amp; Brodie is largely a practical analysis and summary, not a mathematical one – the estimation problem is only mentioned in footnote 3 on page 82, where they estimate the maximum as "sample maximum + average gap".|group=N}} The statistical approach proved to be far more accurate than conventional intelligence methods, and the phrase "German tank problem" became accepted as a descriptor for this type of statistical analysis.

Estimating production was not the only use of this serial-number analysis.  It was also used to understand German production more generally, including number of factories, relative importance of factories, length of supply chain (based on lag between production and use), changes in production, and use of resources such as rubber.

===Specific data===
According to conventional Allied intelligence estimates, the Germans were producing around 1,400 tanks a month between June 1940 and September 1942. Applying the formula below to the serial numbers of captured tanks, the number was calculated to be 256 a month. After the war, captured German production figures from the ministry of [[Albert Speer]] showed the actual number to be 255.&lt;ref name=Davies-2006-07-20/&gt;

Estimates for some specific months are given as:{{sfn|Ruggles|Brodie|1947|p=89}}

===Similar analyses===
[[File:Fusée V2.jpg|thumb|[[V-2]] rocket production was accurately estimated by statistical methods]]
Similar serial-number analysis was used for other military equipment during World War II, most successfully for the [[V-2]] rocket.{{sfn|Ruggles|Brodie|1947|pp=90–91}}

Factory markings on Soviet military equipment were analyzed during the [[Korean War]], and by German intelligence during World War II.{{sfn|Volz|2008}}

In the 1980s, some Americans were given access to the production line of Israel's [[Merkava]] tanks. The production numbers were classified, but the tanks had serial numbers, allowing estimation of production.{{sfn|Johnson|1994}}

The formula has been used in non-military contexts, for example to estimate the number of [[Commodore 64]] computers built, where the result (12.5 million) matches the low-end estimates.&lt;ref name="pagetable.com"&gt;

===Countermeasures===
{{unreferenced section|date=January 2013}}
To prevent serial-number analysis, serial numbers can be excluded, or usable auxiliary information reduced. Alternatively, serial numbers that resist cryptanalysis can be used, most effectively by randomly choosing numbers without replacement from a list that is much larger than the number of objects produced (compare the [[one-time pad]]), or produce random numbers and check them against the list of already assigned numbers; collisions are likely to occur unless the number of digits possible is more than twice the number of digits in the number of objects produced (where the serial number can be in any base); see [[birthday problem]].{{efn|As discussed in [[birthday attack]], one can expect a collision after 1.25{{radic|''H''}} numbers, if choosing from ''H'' possible outputs. This square root corresponds to half the digits.  For example, in any base, the square root of a number with 100 digits is approximately a number with 50 digits.}} For this, a [[cryptographically secure pseudorandom number generator]] may be used. All these methods require a lookup table (or breaking the cypher) to back out from serial number to production order, which complicates use of serial numbers: a range of serial numbers cannot be recalled, for instance, but each must be looked up individually, or a list generated.

Alternatively, sequential serial numbers can be encrypted with a simple [[substitution cipher]], which allows easy decoding, but is also easily broken by a [[known-plaintext attack]]: even if starting from an arbitrary point, the plaintext has a pattern (namely, numbers are in sequence). One example is given in [[Ken Follett]]'s novel ''[[Code to Zero]]'', where the encryption of the [[Jupiter-C]] rocket serial numbers is described as:
&lt;center&gt;
{| class="wikitable"
|- align=center
! H !! U !! N !! T !! S !! V !! I !! L !! E !! X
|- align=center
| 1 || 2 || 3 || 4 || 5 || 6 || 7 || 8 || 9 || 0
|}&lt;/center&gt;

The code word here is [[Huntsville, Alabama|Huntsville]] (with repeated letters omitted) to get a 10-letter key. The rocket number 13 was therefore "HN", and the rocket number 24 was "UT".

Strong encryption of serial numbers without expanding them can be achieved with [[format-preserving encryption]]. Instead of storing a truly random permutation on the set of all possible serial numbers in a large table, such algorithms will derive a pseudo-random permutation from a secret key. Security can then be defined as the pseudo-random permutation being indistinguishable from a truly random permutation to an attacker who doesn't know the key.

==Frequentist analysis==

===Minimum-variance unbiased estimator===
For [[point estimation]] (estimating a single value for the total, &lt;math&gt;\hat{N}&lt;/math&gt;), the [[minimum-variance unbiased estimator]] (MVUE, or UMVU estimator) is given by:{{efn|In a continuous distribution, there is no &amp;minus;1 term.}}

:&lt;math&gt;\hat{N} = m\left(1 + k^{-1}\right) - 1,&lt;/math&gt;

where ''m'' is the largest serial number observed ([[sample maximum]]) and ''k'' is the number of tanks observed ([[sample size]]).{{sfn|Johnson|1994}}&lt;ref name="Johnson2"&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Note that once a serial number has been observed, it is no longer in the pool and will not be observed again.

This has a variance{{sfn|Johnson|1994}}

:&lt;math&gt; \operatorname{var}(\hat{N}) = \frac{1}{k}\frac{(N-k)(N+1)}{(k+2)} \approx \frac{N^2}{k^2} \text{ for small samples } k \ll N,&lt;/math&gt;

so the [[standard deviation]] is approximately ''N''/''k'', the average size of the gap between samples; {{clarify span|compare ''m''/''k'' above|date=February 2016}}.

The formula may be understood intuitively as the sample maximum plus the average gap between observations in the sample, the sample maximum being chosen as the initial estimator, due to being the [[maximum likelihood estimator]],{{efn|Given a particular set of observations, this set is most likely to occur if the population maximum is the sample maximum, not a higher value (it cannot be lower).}} with the gap being added to compensate for the negative bias of the sample maximum as an estimator for the population maximum,{{efn|The sample maximum is never more than the population maximum, but can be less, hence it is a [[biased estimator]]: it will tend to ''underestimate'' the population maximum.}} and written as

:&lt;math&gt;\hat{N} = m + \frac{m - k}{k}= m + mk^{-1} - 1 = m\left(1 + k^{-1}\right) - 1.&lt;/math&gt;

This can be visualized by imagining that the samples are evenly spaced throughout the range, with additional samples just outside the range at 0 and ''N''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;1. If starting with an initial gap between 0 and the lowest sample (sample minimum), the average gap between samples is &lt;math&gt;(m - k)/k&lt;/math&gt;; the &lt;math&gt;-k&lt;/math&gt; being because the samples themselves are not counted in computing the gap between samples.{{efn|1=For example, the gap between 2 and 7 is (7&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;2)&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;1&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;4, consisting of 3, 4, 5, and&amp;nbsp;6.}}. A derivation of the expected value and the variance of the sample maximum are shown in the page of the [[discrete uniform distribution]].

This philosophy is formalized and generalized in the method of [[maximum spacing estimation]]; a similar heuristic is used for 
[[plotting position]] in a [[Q–Q plot]], plotting sample points at {{math|''k'' / (''n'' + 1)}}, which is evenly on the uniform distribution, with a gap at the end.

===Confidence intervals===
Instead of, or in addition to, ''point'' estimation, [[interval estimation|''interval'' estimation]] can be carried out, such as [[confidence interval]]s.
These are easily computed, based on the observation that the probability that ''k'' samples will fall in an interval covering ''p'' of the range (0&amp;nbsp;≤&amp;nbsp;''p''&amp;nbsp;≤&amp;nbsp;1) is ''p''&lt;sup&gt;''k''&lt;/sup&gt; (assuming in this section that draws are ''with'' replacement, to simplify computations; if draws are without replacement, this overstates the likelihood, and intervals will be overly conservative).

Thus the [[sampling distribution]] of the quantile of the sample maximum is the graph ''x''&lt;sup&gt;1/''k''&lt;/sup&gt; from 0 to 1: the ''p''-th to ''q''-th quantile of the sample maximum ''m'' are the interval [''p''&lt;sup&gt;1/''k''&lt;/sup&gt;''N'',&amp;nbsp;''q''&lt;sup&gt;1/''k''&lt;/sup&gt;''N'']. Inverting this yields the corresponding confidence interval for the population maximum of [''m''/''q''&lt;sup&gt;1/''k''&lt;/sup&gt;,&amp;nbsp;''m''/''p''&lt;sup&gt;1/''k''&lt;/sup&gt;].

For example, taking the symmetric 95% interval ''p'' = 2.5% and ''q'' = 97.5% for ''k'' = 5 yields 0.025&lt;sup&gt;1/5&lt;/sup&gt; ≈ 0.48, 0.975&lt;sup&gt;1/5&lt;/sup&gt; ≈ 0.995, so the confidence interval is approximately [1.005''m'', 2.08''m'']. The lower bound is very close to ''m'', thus more informative is the asymmetric confidence interval from ''p'' = 5% to 100%; for ''k'' = 5 this yields 0.05&lt;sup&gt;1/5&lt;/sup&gt; ≈ 0.55 and the interval [''m'',&amp;nbsp;1.82''m''].

More generally, the (downward biased) 95% confidence interval is [''m'', ''m''/0.05&lt;sup&gt;1/''k''&lt;/sup&gt;] = [''m'', ''m''·20&lt;sup&gt;1/k&lt;/sup&gt;]. For a range of ''k'' values, with the UMVU point estimator (plus 1 for legibility) for reference, this yields:
{| class="wikitable"
|-
! ''k'' !! point estimate !! confidence interval
|-
|  1 || 2''m''    || [''m'', 20''m'']
|-
|  2 || 1.5''m''  || [''m'', 4.5''m'']
|-
|  5 || 1.2''m''  || [''m'', 1.82''m'']
|-
| 10 || 1.1''m''  || [''m'', 1.35''m'']
|-
| 20 || 1.05''m'' || [''m'', 1.16''m'']
|}

Immediate observations are:
* For small sample sizes, the confidence interval is very wide, reflecting great uncertainty in the estimate.
* The range shrinks rapidly, reflecting the exponentially decaying likelihood that ''all'' samples will be significantly below the maximum.
* The confidence interval exhibits positive skew, as ''N'' can never be below the sample maximum, but can potentially be arbitrarily high above it.

Note that ''m''/''k'' cannot be used naively (or rather (''m''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;''m''/''k''&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;1)/''k'') as an estimate of the [[standard error (statistics)|standard error]] ''SE'', as the standard error of an estimator is based on the ''population'' maximum (a parameter), and using an estimate to estimate the error in that very estimate is [[circular reasoning]].

==Bayesian analysis==
The Bayesian approach to the German tank problem is to consider the credibility &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle (N=n\mid M=m, K=k)&lt;/math&gt; that the number of enemy tanks &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle N&lt;/math&gt; is equal to the number &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle n&lt;/math&gt;, when the number of observed tanks, &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle K&lt;/math&gt; is equal to the number &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle k&lt;/math&gt;, and the maximum serial number &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle M&lt;/math&gt; is equal to the number &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle m&lt;/math&gt;. The answer to this problem depends on the choice of prior for &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle N&lt;/math&gt;. One can proceed using a proper prior, e.g., the Poisson or Negative Binomial distribution, where closed formula for the posterior mean and posterior variance can be obtained.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Höhle|first=M.|last2=Held|first2=L.|date=2006|title=Bayesian Estimation of the Size of a Population|url=https://epub.ub.uni-muenchen.de/2094/1/paper_499.pdf|journal=Technical Report SFB 386, No. 399, Department of Statistics, University of Munich|doi=|pmid=|access-date=2016-04-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; An alternative is to proceed using direct calculations as shown below.

For brevity, in what follows, &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle (N=n\mid M=m,K=k)&lt;/math&gt; is written &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle (n\mid m,k)&lt;/math&gt;

===Conditional probability===
The rule for [[conditional probability]] gives
:&lt;math&gt;(n\mid m,k)(m\mid k) = (m\mid n,k)(n\mid k)= (m,n\mid k)&lt;/math&gt;

===Probability of ''M'' knowing ''N'' and ''K''===
The expression 
:&lt;math&gt; (m \mid n,k)=(M=m \mid N=n,K=k)&lt;/math&gt; 
is the conditional probability that the maximum serial number observed, ''M'', is equal to ''m'', when the number of enemy tanks, ''N'', is known to be equal to ''n'', and the number of enemy tanks observed, ''K'', is known to be equal to ''k''.

It is
:&lt;math&gt;
  (m\mid n,k) =
    \binom{m - 1}{k - 1}\binom{n}{k}^{-1}[k\le m][m\le n]
&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle \binom n k&lt;/math&gt; is a [[binomial coefficient]] and &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle [k\le n]&lt;/math&gt; is an [[Iverson bracket]].

===Probability of ''M'' knowing only ''K''===
The expression &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle (m\mid k)=(M=m\mid K=k)&lt;/math&gt; is the probability that the maximum serial number is equal to ''m'' once ''k'' tanks have been observed but before the serial numbers have actually been observed.

The expression &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle (m\mid k)&lt;/math&gt; can be re-written in terms of the other quantities by marginalizing over all possible &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle n&lt;/math&gt;.
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
  (m\mid k)
    &amp;=(m\mid k)\cdot 1 \\
    &amp;=(m\mid k){\sum_{n=0}^\infty(n\mid m,k)} \\
    &amp;=(m\mid k){\sum_{n=0}^\infty(m\mid n,k)\frac {(n\mid k)}{(m\mid k)}} \\
    &amp;=\sum_{n=0}^\infty(m\mid n,k)(n\mid k)
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

===Credibility of ''N'' knowing only ''K''===
The expression 
:&lt;math&gt;(n\mid k)=(N=n\mid K=k)&lt;/math&gt; 
is the credibility that the total number of tanks, ''N'', is equal to ''n'' when the number ''K'' tanks observed is known to be ''k'', but before the serial numbers have been observed. Assume that it is some [[discrete uniform distribution]]  
:&lt;math&gt;  (n\mid k) =     (\Omega - k)^{-1}[k \le n][n &lt; \Omega]&lt;/math&gt;

The upper limit  &lt;math&gt;\Omega&lt;/math&gt; must be finite, because the function
:&lt;math&gt;f(n) =\lim_{\Omega\rarr\infty}(\Omega - k)^{-1}[k \le n][n &lt; \Omega]=0&lt;/math&gt;
is not a mass distribution function.

===Credibility of ''N'' knowing  ''M'' and ''K''===
:&lt;math&gt;  (n\mid m,k) = (m\mid n,k)\left(\sum_{n=m}^{\Omega - 1} (m\mid n,k)\right)^{-1}[m \le n][n &lt; \Omega]&lt;/math&gt;

If ''k''&amp;nbsp;≥&amp;nbsp;2, then &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle \sum_{n=m}^\infty(m\mid n,k)&lt;\infty&lt;/math&gt;, and the unwelcome variable &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle \Omega&lt;/math&gt; disappears from the expression.

:&lt;math&gt;  (n\mid m,k) = (m\mid n,k)\left(\sum_{n=m}^{\infty} (m\mid n,k)\right)^{-1}[m \le n ]&lt;/math&gt;
For ''k''&amp;nbsp;≥&amp;nbsp;1 the [[mode (statistics)|mode]] of the distribution of the number of enemy tanks is ''m''.

For ''k''&amp;nbsp;≥&amp;nbsp;2, the credibility that the number of enemy tanks is ''equal to'' &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt;, is
:&lt;math&gt;
  (N=n\mid m,k) = (k - 1)\binom{m - 1}{k - 1}k^{-1}\binom n k^{-1}[m \le n ]
&lt;/math&gt;

The credibility that the number of enemy tanks, ''N'', is ''greater than n'', is
:&lt;math&gt;
 (N&gt;n\mid m,k)= \begin{cases}
    1                                              &amp;\text{if } n &lt; m \\
    \frac {\binom{m - 1}{k - 1}}{\binom n {k - 1}} &amp;\text{if } n \ge m
  \end{cases}
&lt;/math&gt;

===Mean value and standard deviation===
For ''k''&amp;nbsp;≥&amp;nbsp;3, ''N'' has the finite [[mean value]]:
:&lt;math&gt;(m - 1)(k - 1)(k - 2)^{-1}&lt;/math&gt;

For ''k''&amp;nbsp;≥&amp;nbsp;4, ''N'' has the finite [[standard deviation]]:
:&lt;math&gt;(k - 1)^{1/2}(k - 2)^{-1}(k - 3)^{-1/2}(m - 1)^{1/2}(m + 1 - k)^{1/2}&lt;/math&gt;
These formulas are derived below.

===Summation formula===
The following [[Binomial coefficient#Identities involving binomial coefficients|binomial coefficient identity]] is used below for simplifying [[series (mathematics)|series]] relating to the German Tank Problem.
:&lt;math&gt;\sum_{n=m}^\infty \frac 1 {\binom n k} = \frac k{k - 1}\frac 1 {\binom{m - 1}{k - 1}}&lt;/math&gt;

This sum formula is somewhat analogous to the integral formula
:&lt;math&gt;\int_{n=m}^\infty \frac {dn}{n^k} = \frac 1{k - 1}\frac 1{m^{k - 1}}&lt;/math&gt;

These formulas apply for ''k''&amp;nbsp;&gt;&amp;nbsp;1.

===One tank===
Observing one tank randomly out of a population of ''n'' tanks gives the serial number ''m'' with probability 1/''n'' for ''m''&amp;nbsp;≤&amp;nbsp;''n'', and zero probability for ''m''&amp;nbsp;&gt;&amp;nbsp;''n''. Using [[Iverson bracket]] notation this is written
:&lt;math&gt;(M=m\mid N=n,K=1) = (m\mid n) = \frac{[m \le n]}{n}&lt;/math&gt;

This is the conditional probability mass distribution function of &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle m&lt;/math&gt;.

When considered a function of ''n'' for fixed ''m'' this is a likelihood function.
:&lt;math&gt;\mathcal{L}(n) = \frac{[n\ge m]}{n}&lt;/math&gt;

The [[maximum likelihood]] estimate for the total number of tanks is ''N''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''m''.

The total likelihood is [[Infinity|infinite]], being a tail of the [[harmonic series (mathematics)|harmonic series]].

:&lt;math&gt;\sum_n \mathcal{L}(n) = \sum_{n=m}^\infty \frac{1}{n} = \infty&lt;/math&gt;

but
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
  \sum_n \mathcal{L}(n)[n &lt; \Omega]
    &amp;= \sum_{n=m}^{\Omega - 1} \frac{1}{n} \\[5pt]
    &amp;= H_{\Omega-1} - H_{m - 1}
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;H_n&lt;/math&gt; is the [[harmonic number]].

The credibility mass distribution function depends on the prior limit &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle \Omega&lt;/math&gt;:
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
       &amp;(N=n\mid M=m,K=1) \\[5pt]
  = {} &amp;(n\mid m) = \frac{[m\le n]}{n} \frac{[n&lt;\Omega]}{H_{\Omega - 1} - H_{m - 1}}
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

The mean value of  &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle N&lt;/math&gt; is
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
  \sum_n n\cdot(n\mid m) &amp;= \sum_{n=m}^{\Omega - 1} \frac{1}{H_{\Omega - 1} - H_{m - 1}} \\[5pt]
                     &amp;= \frac{\Omega - m}{H_{\Omega - 1} - H_{m - 1}} \\[5pt]
                     &amp;\approx \frac{\Omega - m}{\log\left(\frac{\Omega - 1}{m - 1} \right)}
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

===Two tanks===
If two tanks rather than one are observed, then the probability that the larger of the observed two serial numbers is equal to ''m'', is

:&lt;math&gt;(M=m\mid N=n,K=2) = (m\mid n) = [m \le n]\frac{m - 1}{\binom{n}{2}}&lt;/math&gt;

When considered a function of ''n'' for fixed ''m'' this is a [[likelihood function]]
:&lt;math&gt;\mathcal{L}(n) = [n \ge m]\frac{m - 1}{\binom{n}{2}}&lt;/math&gt;

The total likelihood is

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
  \sum_{n}\mathcal{L}(n) &amp;= \frac{m - 1}{1} \sum_{n=m}^\infty \frac{1}{\binom n 2} \\
                         &amp;= \frac{m - 1}{1} \cdot \frac{2}{2 - 1} \cdot \frac{1}{\binom {m - 1}{2 - 1}} \\
                         &amp;= 2
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

and the credibility mass distribution function is

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
       &amp;(N=n\mid M=m,K=2) \\
  = {} &amp;(n\mid m) \\
  = {} &amp;\frac{\mathcal{L}(n)}{\sum_n \mathcal{L}(n)} \\
  = {} &amp;[n \ge m]\frac{m - 1}{n(n - 1)}
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

The [[median]] &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle \tilde{N}&lt;/math&gt; satisfies
:&lt;math&gt;\sum_n [n \ge \tilde{N}](n\mid m) = \frac{1}{2}&lt;/math&gt;

so
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{m - 1}{\tilde N - 1} = \frac{1}{2}&lt;/math&gt;

and so the median is
:&lt;math&gt;\tilde{N} = 2m - 1&lt;/math&gt;

but the mean value of ''N'' is infinite
:&lt;math&gt;\mu = \sum_n n \cdot (n\mid m) = \frac{m - 1}1\sum_{n=m}^\infty \frac{1}{n - 1} = \infty&lt;/math&gt;

===Many tanks===

====Credibility mass distribution function====
The conditional probability that the largest of ''k'' observations taken from the serial numbers {1,...,''n''}, is equal to ''m'', is
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
       &amp;(M=m\mid N=n,K=k\ge 2) \\
  = {} &amp;(m\mid n,k) \\
  = {} &amp;[m\le n]\frac{\binom{m - 1}{k - 1}}{\binom{n}{k}}
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

The likelihood function of ''n'' is the same expression
:&lt;math&gt;\mathcal{L}(n) = [n \ge m]\frac{\binom{m - 1}{k - 1}}{\binom{n}{k}}&lt;/math&gt;

The total likelihood is finite for ''k'' ≥ 2:
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
  \sum_n \mathcal{L}(n)
    &amp;= \frac{\binom{m - 1}{k - 1}}{1} \sum_{n=m}^\infty {1 \over \binom n k} \\
    &amp;= \frac{\binom{m - 1}{k - 1}}{1} \cdot \frac{k}{k-1} \cdot \frac{1}{\binom{m - 1}{k - 1}} \\
    &amp;= \frac k{k - 1}
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

The credibility mass distribution function is
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
       &amp;(N=n\mid M=m,K=k \ge 2) = (n\mid m,k) \\
  = {} &amp;\frac{\mathcal{L}(n)}{\sum_n \mathcal{L}(n)} \\
  = {} &amp;[n\ge m]\frac{k-1}{k} \frac{\binom{m - 1}{k - 1}}{\binom n k} \\
  = {} &amp;[n\ge m]\frac{m-1}{n} \frac{\binom{m - 2}{k - 2}}{\binom{n - 1}{k - 1}} \\
  = {} &amp;[n\ge m]\frac{m-1}{n} \frac{m - 2}{n - 1} \frac{k - 1}{k - 2}  \frac{\binom{m - 3}{k - 3}}{\binom{n-2}{k-2}}
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

The [[complementary cumulative distribution function]] is the credibility that ''N'' &gt; ''x''
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
       &amp;(N&gt;x\mid M=m,K=k) \\
  = {} &amp;\begin{cases}
                                    1 &amp;\text{if }x   &lt; m \\
          \sum_{n=x+1}^\infty (n\mid m,k) &amp;\text{if }x \ge m
        \end{cases} \\
  = {} &amp;[x&lt;m] + [x \ge m]\sum_{n=x+1}^\infty \frac{k - 1}{k}\frac{\binom{m - 1}{k - 1}}{\binom{N}{k}} \\
  = {} &amp;[x&lt;m] + [x \ge m]\frac{k - 1}{k} \frac{\binom{m - 1}{k - 1}}{1} \sum_{n=x+1}^\infty \frac{1}{\binom{n}{k}} \\
  = {} &amp;[x&lt;m] + [x \ge m]\frac{k - 1}{k} \frac{\binom{m - 1}{k - 1}}{1} \cdot \frac{k}{k - 1} \frac{1}{\binom{x}{k - 1}} \\
  = {} &amp;[x&lt;m] + [x \ge m]\frac{\binom{m - 1}{k - 1}}{\binom{x}{k - 1}}
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

The [[cumulative distribution function]] is the credibility that ''N'' ≤ ''x''
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
       &amp;(N\le x\mid M=m,K=k) \\
  = {} &amp;1 - (N&gt;x\mid M=m,K=k) \\
  = {} &amp;[x \ge m]\left(1 - \frac{\binom{m - 1}{k - 1}}{\binom{x}{k - 1}}\right)
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

====Order of magnitude====

The order of magnitude of the number of enemy tanks is
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
  \mu &amp;= \sum_n n\cdot(N=n\mid M=m,K=k) \\&amp;
       = \sum_n n [n\ge m]\frac {m-1}n \frac {\binom{m-2}{k-2}}{\binom{n-1}{k-1}}  \\&amp;
       = \frac{m-1}1 \frac{\binom{m-2}{k-2}}1\sum_{n=m}^\infty \frac 1{\binom{n-1}{k-1}}\\&amp;
       = \frac{m-1}1 \frac{\binom{m-2}{k-2}}1 \cdot \frac{k-1}{k-2}\frac {1}{\binom{m-2}{k-2}}\\&amp;
       = \frac{m-1}1 \frac{k-1}{k-2}
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

====Statistical uncertainty====

The statistical uncertainty is the standard deviation ''σ'', satisfying the equation
:&lt;math&gt;\sigma^2 + \mu^2 = \sum_n n^2 \cdot (N=n\mid M=m,K=k)&lt;/math&gt;

So
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
  \sigma^2+\mu^2-\mu &amp;= \sum_n n(n-1)\cdot(N=n\mid M=m,K=k)\\&amp;
                      = \sum_{n=m}^\infty n(n-1)\frac{m-1}n \frac{m-2}{n-1} \frac{k-1}{k-2} \frac{\binom{m-3}{k-3}}{\binom{n-2}{k-2}}\\&amp;
                      = \frac{m-1}1 \frac{m-2}1 \frac{k-1}{k-2} \cdot \frac{\binom{m-3}{k-3}}1 \sum_{n=m}^\infty \frac 1{\binom{n-2}{k-2}}\\
&amp; = \frac{m-1}1 \frac{m-2}1 \frac{k-1}{k-2} \frac{\binom{m-3}{k-3}}1 \frac{k-2}{k-3} \frac 1{\binom{m-3}{k-3}}\\
&amp; = \frac{m-1}1 \frac{m-2}1 \frac{k-1}{k-3}\\&amp;
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

and 
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
  \sigma &amp;= \sqrt{\frac{m-1}1 \frac{m-2}1 \frac{k-1}{k-3}+\mu-\mu^2} \\&amp;
          = \sqrt{\frac{(k-1)(m-1)(m-k+1)}{(k-3)(k-2)^2}} \\&amp;
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

The [[variance-to-mean ratio]] is simply
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{\sigma^2}\mu = \frac{m - k + 1}{(k - 3)(k - 2)}&lt;/math&gt;

The '''International Astrophysical Observatory "GRANAT"''' (usually known as '''Granat'''; {{lang-ru|Гранат}}), was a [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] (later [[Russia]]n) [[space observatory]] developed in collaboration with [[France]], [[Denmark]] and [[Bulgaria]]. It was launched on 1 December 1989 aboard a [[Proton (rocket)|Proton rocket]] and placed in a [[Orbital eccentricity|highly eccentric]] four-day [[orbit]], of which three were devoted to observations. It operated for almost nine years.

In September 1994, after nearly five years of directed observations, the gas supply for its [[Attitude dynamics and control|attitude control]] was exhausted and the observatory was placed in a non-directed survey mode. Transmissions finally ceased on 27 November 1998.&lt;ref name="NASA"/&gt;

With seven different instruments on board, Granat was designed to observe the universe at energies ranging from [[X-ray]] to [[gamma ray]]. Its main instrument, SIGMA, was capable of imaging both hard X-ray and soft gamma-ray sources. The PHEBUS instrument was meant to study gamma-ray bursts and other transient X-Ray sources. Other experiments such as ART-P were intended to image X-Ray sources in the 35 to 100&amp;nbsp;[[Kiloelectronvolt|keV]] range. One instrument, WATCH, was designed to monitor the sky continuously and alert the other instruments to new or interesting X-Ray sources. The ART-S spectrometer covered the X-ray energy range while the KONUS-B and TOURNESOL experiments covered both the X-ray and gamma ray spectrum.

== Spacecraft ==
Granat was a three-axis-stabilized spacecraft and the last of the [[4MV]] Bus produced by the [[Lavochkin|Lavochkin Scientific Production Association]]. It was similar to the [[Astron (spacecraft)|Astron]] observatory which was functional from 1983 to 1989; for this reason, the spacecraft was originally known as the Astron 2. It weighed 4.4 [[Tonne|metric ton]]s and carried almost 2.3 metric tons of international scientific instrumentation. Granat stood 6.5&amp;nbsp;m tall and had a total span of 8.5 m across its [[solar array]]s. The power made available to the scientific instruments was approximately 400&amp;nbsp;[[Watt|W]].&lt;ref name="fas"/&gt;

== Launch and orbit ==
[[Image:Proton with Granat.jpg|thumb|left|Proton launch vehicle carrying Granat]]

The spacecraft was launched on 1 December 1989 aboard a [[Proton-K]] from the [[Baikonur Cosmodrome]] in [[Kazakh SSR]]. It was placed in a [[Orbital eccentricity|highly eccentric]] 98-hour orbit with an initial [[apogee]]/[[perigee]] of 202,480&amp;nbsp;km/1,760&amp;nbsp;km respectively and an inclination of 51.9 degrees.&lt;ref name="table"/&gt; This meant that solar and lunar perturbations would significantly increase the orbits inclination while reducing its eccentricity, such that the orbit had become near-circular by the time Granat completed its directed observations in September 1994. (By 1991, the perigee had increased to 20,000&amp;nbsp;km; by September 1994, the apogee/perigee was 59,025&amp;nbsp;km{{\}}144,550&amp;nbsp;km at an inclination of 86.7 degrees.)

Three days out of the four-day orbit were devoted to observations.&lt;ref name="IKI"/&gt; After over nine years in orbit, the observatory finally [[atmospheric reentry|reentered]] the Earth's atmosphere on May 25, 1999.&lt;ref name="Reentry"/&gt;

===SIGMA===
[[Image:Granat sigma layout.gif|thumb|SIGMA instrument]]

The hard X-ray and low-energy gamma-ray SIGMA [[telescope]] was a collaboration between [[Centre d'Etude Spatiale des Rayonnements|CESR]] (Toulouse) and [[Commissariat à l'énergie atomique|CEA]] (Saclay). It covered the energy range 35–1300&amp;nbsp;keV,&lt;ref name="SIGMA"/&gt; with an effective area of 800&amp;nbsp;cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; and a maximum sensitivity field of view of ~5°&amp;times;5°. The maximum [[angular resolution]] was 15&amp;nbsp;arcmin.&lt;ref name=Revnivtsev2004/&gt; The energy resolution was 8% at 511&amp;nbsp;keV.&lt;ref name=IKI/&gt; Its imaging capabilities were derived from the association of a coded mask and a position sensitive detector based on the Anger camera principle.&lt;ref name="NASA"/&gt;

===ART-P===
[[Image:Granat ART-P.gif|thumb|left|ART-P instrument]]
The ART-P X-ray telescope was the responsibility of the [[Russian Space Research Institute|IKI]] in [[Moscow]]. The instrument covered the energy range 4 to 60&amp;nbsp;keV for imaging and 4 to 100&amp;nbsp;keV for spectroscopy and timing. There were four identical modules of the ART-P telescope, each consisting of a position sensitive [[Wire chamber|multi-wire proportional counter (MWPC)]] together with a URA coded mask. Each module had an effective area of approximately 600&amp;nbsp;cm², producing a [[field of view]] of 1.8° by 1.8°. The angular resolution was 5 [[Minute of arc|arcmin]]; temporal and energy resolutions were 3.9&amp;nbsp;[[Millisecond|ms]] and 22% at 6&amp;nbsp;keV, respectively.&lt;ref name="ART-P"/&gt; The instrument achieved a sensitivity of 0.001 of the [[Crab nebula]] source (= 1 "mCrab") in an eight-hour exposure. The maximum time resolution was 4&amp;nbsp;ms.&lt;ref name="NASA"/&gt;&lt;ref name=IKI/&gt;

===ART-S===
The ART-S X-ray spectrometer, also built by the IKI, covered the energy range 3 to 100&amp;nbsp;keV. Its field of view was 2° by 2°. The instrument consisted of four detectors based on [[Spectroscopy|spectroscopic]] MWPCs, making an effective area of 2,400&amp;nbsp;cm² at 10&amp;nbsp;keV and 800&amp;nbsp;cm² at 100&amp;nbsp;keV. The time resolution was 200 [[microsecond]]s.&lt;ref name="NASA"/&gt;

===PHEBUS===
The PHEBUS experiment was designed by [[Centre d'Etude Spatiale des Rayonnements|CESR (Toulouse)]] to record high energy transient events in the range 100&amp;nbsp;keV to 100&amp;nbsp;MeV. It consisted of two independent detectors and their associated [[electronics]]. Each detector consisted of a [[bismuth germanate]] (BGO) crystal 78&amp;nbsp;mm in [[diameter]] by 120&amp;nbsp;mm thick, surrounded by a plastic anti-coincidence jacket. The two detectors were arranged on the spacecraft so as to observe 4[[Pi|π]] [[steradian]]s. The burst mode was triggered when the count rate in the 0.1 to 1.5&amp;nbsp;MeV energy range exceeded the background level by 8 &lt;!--explain:--&gt;[[sigma]] in either 0.25 or 1.0 seconds. There were 116 &lt;!--explain:--&gt;energy channels.&lt;ref name="NASA"/&gt;

===WATCH===
Starting in January 1990, four WATCH instruments, designed by the [[Danish Space Research Institute]], were in operation on the Granat observatory. The instruments could localize bright sources in the 6 to 180&amp;nbsp;keV range to within 0.5° using a Rotation Modulation [[Collimator]]. Taken together, the instruments' three fields of view covered approximately 75% of the sky. The energy resolution was 30% [[Full width at half maximum|FWHM]] at 60&amp;nbsp;keV. During quiet periods, count rates in two energy bands (6 to 15 and 15 to 180&amp;nbsp;keV) were accumulated for 4, 8, or 16 seconds, depending on onboard computer memory availability. During a burst or transient event, count rates were accumulated with a [[Temporal resolution|time resolution]] of 1 second per 36 &lt;!--See previous section:--&gt;energy channels.&lt;ref name="NASA"/&gt;

===KONUS-B===
The KONUS-B instrument, designed by the [[Ioffe Physico-Technical Institute]] in [[Saint Petersburg|St. Petersburg]], consisted of seven detectors distributed around the spacecraft that responded to [[photon]]s of 10&amp;nbsp;keV to 8&amp;nbsp;MeV energy. They consisted of [[Sodium iodide|NaI]](Tl) [[Gamma ray spectroscopy#Scintillator Detector|scintillator crystal]]s 200&amp;nbsp;mm in diameter by 50&amp;nbsp;mm thick behind a [[Beryllium|Be]] entrance window. The side surfaces were protected by a 5&amp;nbsp;mm thick lead layer. The burst detection threshold was 500 to 50 [[Joule|microjoules]] per square meter (5&amp;nbsp;&amp;times;&amp;nbsp;10{{smallsup|-7}} to 5&amp;nbsp;&amp;times;&amp;nbsp;10{{smallsup|-8}} erg/cm²), depending on the burst spectrum and [[rise time]]. [[electromagnetic spectrum|Spectra]] were taken in two 31-channel [[pulse height analyzer]]s (PHAs), of which the first eight were measured with 1/16&amp;nbsp;s time resolution and the remaining with variable time resolutions depending on the count rate. The range of resolutions covered 0.25 to 8&amp;nbsp;s.

The KONUS-B instrument operated from 11 December 1989 until 20 February 1990. Over that period, the "on" time for the experiment was 27 days. Some 60 solar flares and 19 cosmic gamma-ray bursts were detected.&lt;ref name="NASA"/&gt;

===TOURNESOL===
The French TOURNESOL instrument consisted of four proportional counters and two [[Photodetector|optical detector]]s. The proportional counters detected photons between 2&amp;nbsp;keV and 20&amp;nbsp;MeV in a 6° by 6° field of view. The visible detectors had a field of view of 5° by 5°. The instrument was designed to look for optical counterparts of high-energy burst sources, as well as performing [[Gamma spectroscopy|spectral analysis]] of the high-energy events.&lt;ref name="NASA"/&gt;

== Science results ==
Over the initial four years of directed observations, Granat observed many galactic and extra-galactic X-ray sources with emphasis on the deep imaging and spectroscopy of the [[galactic center]], broad-band observations of [[black hole]] candidates, and [[Soft X-ray transient|X-ray novae]]. After 1994, the observatory was switched to survey mode and carried out a sensitive all-sky survey in the 40 to 200&amp;nbsp;keV energy band.

Some of the highlights included:
* A very deep imaging (more than 5 million seconds duration) of the galactic center region.&lt;ref name="IKI Sigma"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://hea.iki.rssi.ru/GRANAT/sigma/sigma.html |title=SIGMA Telescope |publisher=[[IKI RAN]] |accessdate=2008-05-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Discovery of [[electron]]-[[positron]] annihilation lines from the galactic [[microquasar]] 1E1740-294 and the [[GRS 1124-683|X-ray Nova Muscae]].&lt;ref name="NASA2"/&gt;
* Study of spectra and time variability of black hole candidates.&lt;ref name="NASA2"/&gt;
* Across eight years of observations, Granat discovered some twenty new X-ray sources, i.e. candidate [[black hole]]s and [[neutron star]]s. Consequently, their designations begin with "GRS" meaning "GRANAT source".&lt;ref name="IKI"/&gt; Examples are [[GRS 1915+105]] (the first [[microquasar]] discovered in [[Milky Way|our galaxy]]) and [[GRS 1124-683]].&lt;ref name="IKI"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Revnivtsev2004"&gt;M.G. Revnivtsev, R.A. Sunyaev, M.R. Gilfanov, E.M. Churazov, A. Goldwurm, J. Paul, P. Mandrou and J. P. Roques "[http://www.springerlink.com/content/p461k5k336p11568 A hard X-ray sky survey with the SIGMA telescope of the GRANAT observatory]", (2004) ''[[Astronomy Letters]]'', vol. 30, p.527-533&lt;/ref&gt;

== Impact of the dissolution of the Soviet Union ==
After the end of the [[Soviet Union]], two problems arose for the project. The first was geopolitical in nature: the main spacecraft control center was located at the [[Yevpatoria]] facility in the [[Crimea]] region. This control center was significant in the Soviet space program, being one of only two in the country equipped with a 70&amp;nbsp;m [[dish antenna]]. With the breakup of the Union, the Crimea region, although mostly populated by ethnic Russians, found itself part of the newly independent [[Ukraine]] and the center was put under Ukrainian national control, prompting new political hurdles.&lt;ref name="fas"/&gt;

The main and most urgent problem, however, was in finding funds to support the continued operation of the spacecraft amid the spending crunch in post-Soviet Russia. The [[CNES|French space agency]], having already contributed significantly to the project (both scientifically and financially), took upon itself to fund the continuing operations directly.&lt;ref name="fas"/&gt;

The '''Host Based Security System''' ('''HBSS''') is the official name given to the United States [[United States Department of Defense|Department of Defense]] (DOD) [[Commercial off-the-shelf|commercial-off-the-shelf]] (COTS) suite of software applications used within the DOD to monitor, detect, and defend the DOD computer networks and systems.  The [[Enterprise-wide Information Assurance and computer Network Defense Solutions Steering Group]] (ESSG) sponsored the acquisition of the HBSS System for use within the DOD Enterprise Network.  HBSS is deployed on both the [[NIPRNet|Non-Classified Internet Protocol Routed Network]] (NIPRNet) and [[SIPRNet|Secret Internet Protocol Routed Network]] (SIPRNet) networks, with priority given to installing it on the NIPRNet.  HBSS is based on [[McAfee|McAfee, Inc]]'s [[ePolicy Orchestrator]] (ePO) and other McAfee point product security applications such as [[Host Intrusion Prevention System]] (HIPS).

== History ==
Seeing the need to supply a comprehensive, department-wide security suite of tools for DOD System Administrators, the ESSG started to gather requirements for the formation of a host-based security system in the summer of 2005.  In March 2006, [[BAE Systems]] and McAfee were awarded a contract to supply an automated host-based security system to the department.  After the award, 22 pilot sites were identified to receive the first deployments of HBSS.&lt;ref&gt;''Host Based Security System'', http://www.disa.mil/hbss/index.html, 3/13/2010&lt;/ref&gt;  During the pilot roll out, DOD System Administrators around the world were identified and trained on using the HBSS software in preparation for software deployment across DOD.

On October 9, 2007, the [[Joint Task Force for Global Network Operations]] (JTF-GNO) released [[Communications Tasking Order]] (CTO) 07-12 (''Deployment of Host Based Security System (HBSS)'') mandating the deployment of HBSS on all Combatant Command, Service and Agency (CC/S/A) networks within DOD with the completion date by the 3rd quarter of 2008.&lt;ref&gt;''Host Based Security System HBSS)'',http://www.afcea.org/events/landwarnet/08/infoexchange.asp, 3/13/2010&lt;/ref&gt; The release of this CTO brought HBSS to the attention of all major department heads and CC/S/A's, providing the ESSG with the necessary authority to enforce its deployment.  Agencies not willing to comply with the CTO now risked being disconnected from the DOD [[Global Information Grid]] (GIG) for any lack of compliance.

Lessons learned from the pilot deployments provided valuable insight to the HBSS program, eventually leading to the [[Defense Information Systems Agency]] (DISA) supplying both pre-loaded HBSS hardware as well as providing an HBSS software image that could be loaded on compliant hardware platforms.  This proved to be invaluable to easing the deployment task on the newly trained HBSS System Administrators and provided a consistent department-wide software baseline.  DISA further provided step-by-step documentation for completing an HBSS baseline creation from a freshly installed operating system.  The lessons learned from the NIPRNet deployments simplified the process of deploying HBSS on the SIPRNet.

=== Significant HBSS dates ===
* Summer 2005: ESSG gathered information on establishing an HBSS automated system
* March 2006: BAE Systems and McAfee awarded contract for HBSS establishment and deployment
* March 27, 2007: The ESSG approved the HBSS for full-scale deployment throughout the DoD enterprise
* October 9, 2007: The [[Joint Task Force for Global Network Operations|JTF-GNO]] releases CTO 07-12
* November, 2009: The [[Air Force]] awarded [[Northrop Grumman|Northrop Grumman, Inc.]] with the deployment of HBSS on the SIPRNet&lt;ref&gt;Henry Kenyon, ''Northrop Grumman Wins Air Force SIPRNET Contract'',http://www.afcea.org/signal/signalscape/index.php/2009/11/northrop-grumman-wins-air-force-siprnet-contract/, 3/13/2010&lt;/ref&gt;

== HBSS components ==
Throughout its lifetime, HBSS has undergone several major baseline updates as well as minor maintenance releases.  The first major release of HBSS was known as Baseline 1.0 and contained the McAfee ePolicy orchestrator engine, HIPS, [[software compliance profiler]] (SCP), [[rogue system detection]] (RSD), [[asset baseline manager]] (ABM), and assets software.  As new releases were introduced, these software products have evolved, had new products added, and in some cases, been completely replaced for different products.

As of January, 2011, HBSS is currently at Baseline 4.5, Maintenance Release 2.0 (MR2). MR2 contains the following software:

== How HBSS works ==
The heart of the HBSS is the McAfee ePolicy orchestrator (ePO) management engine.  The engine is responsible for:
* Providing a consistent front-end to the point products
* Consolidating point product data for analysis
* Presenting point product reports
* Managing the point product updates and communications
* Ensure application patch compliance

&lt;!----==== Security compliance profiler ====
The security compliance profiler (SCP) was one of the original products provided in HBSS Baseline 1.0.  It was removed from HBSS as of Baseline 2.0 and replaced with the policy auditor component.  The SCP is an integral component of ePO that provides enterprise-wide reporting on security patches, including the Microsoft® operating systems.&lt;ref&gt;'''System Compliance Profiler''',http://www.mcafee.com/us/enterprise/products/promos/system_security_management/epolicy_orchestrator/compliance_profiler.html, 3/14/2010&lt;/ref&gt;
----&gt;

=== McAfee point products ===
McAfee considers a  point product to be the individual software applications controlled by  the ePO server.  The HBSS point products consist of the following:
* Host  intrusion prevention system (HIPS)
* Policy auditor (PA)
* Assets  baseline module (ABM)
* Rogue system detection (RSD)
* Device  control module (DCM)
* Asset publishing service (APS)

==== Host intrusion prevention system ====
The host intrusion prevention  system (HIPS) consists of a host-based firewall and application-level blocking consolidated in a single product.  The HIPS component is one of the most  significant components of the HBSS, as it provides for the capability  to block known intrusion signatures and restrict unauthorized services  and applications running on the host machines.

==== Policy auditor ====
Policy auditor (PA) was  introduced in HBSS Baseline 2.0.  Policy auditor is responsible for ensuring compliance with mandates such as: [[Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard]] (PCI DSS), [[Sarbanes–Oxley Act of 2002]] (SOX), [[Gramm–Leach–Bliley Act]] of 1999 (GLBA), [[Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996]] (HIPAA), [[Federal Information Security Management Act of 2002]] (FISMA), as well as the best practice frameworks [[ISO 27001:2005]] and Control Objectives for Information and related technology ([[COBIT]]).  PA maps IT controls against predefined policy content, McAfee Policy Auditor helps report consistently and accurately against key industry mandates and internal policies across your infrastructure or on specific targeted systems. Policy Auditor is an agent-based IT audit solution that leverages the Security Content Automation Protocol (SCAP) to automate the processes required for internal and external IT audits.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=McAfee Policy Auditor|url=http://www.mcafee.com/us/products/policy-auditor.aspx|accessdate=15 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Assets baseline module ====
The assets  baseline module, released in Baseline 1.0 as a [[government off-the-shelf]] (GOTS) product, is used to  address system baseline configurations and changes in order to respond  to [[INFOCON|information operations condition (INFOCON)]] (INFOCON) changes necessary during times of  heightened security threats to the system.  During the initial  deployment stages of HBSS, the assets module was juvenile and lacked  much of the products intended capabilities.  However, the application  has fully evolved into a robust and feature packed version capable of  handling the original software's design goals.  ABM was originally known  as Assets 1.0.  It was upgraded to Assets 2.0 in HBSS Baseline 2.0.   Later it was called Assets 3000 in HBSS Baseline 3.0.

==== Rogue system detection ====
The rogue system  detector (RSD) component of HBSS is used to provide real-time detection  of new hosts attaching to the network.  RSD monitors network segments  and reports all hosts seen on the network to the ePO Server.  The ePO  Server then determines whether the system is connected to the ePO server, has a McAfee agent installed, has been identified as an  exception, or is considered rogue.  The ePO server can then take the  appropriate action(s) concerning the rogue host, as specified in the RSD  policy.  HBSS Baseline 1.0 introduced RSD 1.0.  RSD was updated to 2.0  in HBSS Baseline 2.0.

==== Device control module/data loss prevention ====
The DCM component of HBSS was  introduced in HBSS Baseline 2.0 specifically to address the use of USB  devices on DOD networks.  JTF-GNO CTO 09-xxx, ''removable flash media device implementation within and between Department of Defense (DOD) networks'' was released in March, 2009 and  allowed the use of USB removable media, provided it meets all of the conditions stated within the CTO.  One of these conditions requires the use of HBSS with the DCM module installed and configured to manage the USB devices attached to the system.&lt;ref&gt;Tom Conway, ''DOD Can Safely Use USB'',http://blogs.mcafee.com/enterprise/public-sector/dod-can-use-usb-securely, (security insights blog), 3/9/2010&lt;/ref&gt; The DCM was renamed to the data loss prevention (DLP) in HBSS Baseline 3.0 MR3.

==== Assets publishing service ====
The assets publishing service (APS) of HBSS was introduced in HBSS Baseline 4.0 to allow for enclaves to report on asset information to a third-party DoD entity in a standards-compliant format.  It adds contextual information to HBSS assets and allows for improved reporting features on systems relying on HBSS data.

== Obtaining HBSS ==
According to JTF-GNO CTO 07-12, all DOD agencies are required to deploy HBSS to their networks.  DISA has made HBSS software available for download on their [[Public key infrastructure|PKI]] protected [https://patches.csd.disa.mil/ patch server].  Users attempting to download the software are required to have a [[common access card]] (CAC) and be on a .mil network.  DISA provides software and updates free of charge to DOD entities.

Additionally, HBSS administrators require the satisfactory completion of HBSS training and are commonly appointed by the unit or section commander in writing.

== Learning HBSS ==
In order to receive and administer an HBSS system, system administrators must satisfactorily complete online or in class HBSS training as well as be identified as an HBSS administrator.  Online training takes 30 hours to complete while in class training requires four days, excluding travel.  An advanced HBSS class is also available to HBSS administrators wishing to acquire a more in-depth knowledge of the system.  HBSS online and in class training is managed by DISA and information pertaining to these training classes can be obtained at the DISA [http://iase.disa.mil Information Assurance Support Environment] (IASE) website.

== HBSS support ==
The DISA Risk Management Executive Office (RE) formerly [[field security office]] (FSO) provides free technical support for all HBSS Administrators through their help desk.  DISA has three tiers of support, from Tier I to Tier III.  Tier I and Tier II support is provided by DISA FSO, while Tier III support is provided by McAfee.  DISA FSO Support is available using one of the following methods:&lt;ref&gt;''IA Tools'', http://iase.disa.mil/tools/index.html, 3/14/2010&lt;/ref&gt;

== The future of HBSS ==
At its current pace, HBSS has been updated several times from the original Baseline 1.0 to the current Baseline 3.0, MR3 version.  Within Baseline 3.0, maintenance releases have been introduced every two to four months, bringing better stability and security with each release.  HBSS follows McAfee ePO version updates closely and it is expected to continue this trend as ePO is continuously developed.

[[File:Pollution de l'air.jpg|thumb|Pollution from a factory]]
'''I = PAT''' is the mathematical notation of a formula put forward to describe the [[human impacts on the environment|impact of human activity on the environment]].

:'''I''' = '''P''' × '''A''' × '''T'''

The expression equates [[Environmental issue|human impact on the environment]] to the [[product (mathematics)|product]] of three [[independent variable|factors]]: [[World population|Population]], [[Affluence]], and [[Technology]]. It is similar in form to the [[Kaya identity]] which applies specifically to emissions of the [[greenhouse gas]] [[carbon dioxide]].

The validity of expressing environmental impact as a simple product of independent factors, and the factors that should be included and their comparative importance, have been the subject of debate among environmentalists. In particular, some have drawn attention to potential inter-relationships among the three factors; and others have wished to stress other factors not included in the formula, such as political and social structures, and the scope for beneficial, as well as harmful, environmental actions.

==History==
The equation was developed in 1970 during the course of a debate between [[Barry Commoner]], [[Paul R. Ehrlich]] and [[John Holdren]]. Commoner argued that [[environmental impact]]s in the United States were caused primarily by changes in its production technology following [[World War II]] and aimed his thoughts on present day deteriorating environmental conditions in the U.S. Ehrlich and Holdren argued that all three factors were important and emphasized in particular the role of human [[population growth]], but focused more on a broader scale, being less specific in space and time.&lt;ref name ="End of Population Growth"&gt;{{cite book | last1 = O'Neill | first1 = B.C. |last2 = MacKellar | first2 = F.L. | first3 = W.| last3= Lutz | date = 2004 | chapter = Population, greenhouse gas emissions, and climate change | title = The End of World Population Growth in the 21st Century: New Challenges for Human Capital Formation &amp; Sustainable Development | editor1-first = W. | editor1-last = Lutz | editor2-first = W.C. | editor2-last= Sanderson | editor3-first= S. | editor3-last = Scherbov | publisher = Earthscan Press | location = London | pages = 283–314}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Ehrlich  | first1 = Paul R.  | authorlink1 = Paul R.

The equation can aid in understanding some of the factors affecting human impacts on the environment,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Chertow | first1 = M. R. | authorlink1 = Marian Chertow| title = The IPAT Equation and Its Variants | doi = 10.1162/10881980052541927 | journal = Journal of Industrial Ecology | volume = 4 | issue = 4 | pages = 13–29 | year = 2000 | pmid =  | pmc = }}&lt;/ref&gt; but it has also been cited as a basis for many of the dire environmental predictions of the 1970s by [[Paul R. Ehrlich|Paul Ehrlich]], [[George Wald]], [[Denis Hayes]], [[Lester R. Brown|Lester Brown]], [[René Dubos]], and [[Sidney Dillon Ripley|Sidney Ripley]] that did not come to pass.&lt;ref name="bailey_2000"&gt;[[Ronald Bailey|R Bailey]] (2000) ''Earth day then and now'', [[Reason (magazine)|Reason]] '''32'''(1), 18-28&lt;/ref&gt; [[Neal Koblitz]] classified equations of this type as "mathematical [[propaganda]]" and criticized Ehrlich's use of them in the media (e.g. on [[The Tonight Show]]) to sway the general public.&lt;ref name="koblitz_1981"&gt;[[Neal Koblitz|N Koblitz]] (1981) "Mathematics as Propaganda", in ''Mathematics Tomorrow'', ed. [[Lynn Steen]], pp 111-120.&lt;/ref&gt;

==The dependent variable: Impact==
&lt;!-- A definition of impact was missing. Added here.  --&gt;

The variable "I" in the "I=PAT" equation represents environmental impact. The environment may be viewed as a self-regenerating system that can sustain a certain level of impact sustainably. The maximum sustainable impact is called the [[carrying capacity]]. As long as "I" is less than this amount the associated population, affluence, and technology that make up "I" are sustainable. If "I" exceeds the carrying capacity, then the system is said to be in [[Overshoot (population)|overshoot]], which can only be a temporary state. Overshoot may degrade the ability of the environment to sustain impact, therefore reducing the carrying capacity.

Impact may be measured using [[ecological footprint]] analysis in units of [[global hectares]] (gha). Ecological footprint per capita is a measure of the quantity of  Earth's biologically productive surface that is needed to regenerate the resources consumed per capita.

Impact is modeled as the product of three terms, giving gha as a result. Population is expressed in human numbers, therefore Affluence is measured in units of gha per capita. Technology is a unitless efficiency  factor.

==The three factors==
===Population===
{{See also|World population|Human overpopulation}}

[[File:Population curve.svg|thumb|right|upright=1.5|right|Population (est.) 10,000 BC – 2000 AD.]]

In the '''I=PAT''' equation, the variable '''P''' represents the population of an area, such as the world. Since the rise of industrial societies, human population has been increasing exponentially. This has caused [[Thomas Malthus]], [[Paul R. Ehrlich|Paul Ehrlich]] and many others{{Who|date=February 2011}} to postulate that this growth would continue until checked by widespread hunger and famine (see [[Malthusian growth model]]).

The United Nations project that world population will increase from 7.6 billion today (2018) to 9.8 billion in 2050 and about 11.2 billion in 2100.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://esa.un.org/unpd/wpp/Publications/Files/WPP2017_KeyFindings.pdf|title=Population Prospects 2017|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
These projections take into consideration that population growth has slowed in recent years as women are having fewer children. This phenomenon is the result of [[demographic transition]] all over the world. The UN projects that human population might stabilize around 11.2 billion in 2100 (up from 9.2 billion).&lt;ref name="End of Population Growth"/&gt; However, since the world population is set to keep rising for the next few decades, this factor of the '''I=PAT''' equation will likely keep increasing [[human impact on the environment]] for the near future.

====Environmental impacts of population====
Increased population increases humans' environmental impact in many ways, which include but are not limited to:

* Increased [[land use]] - Results in habitat loss for other species.
* Increased [[resource use]] - Results in changes in land cover
* Increased [[pollution]] - Can cause sickness and damages [[ecosystem]]s.

===Affluence===
{{Main|Consumption (economics)}}

[[File:World GDP Capita 1-2003 A.D.png|thumb|right|upright=1.5|right|World GDP per capita (in 1990 [[Geary-Khamis dollars]])]]

The variable '''A''', in the '''I=PAT''' equation stands for [[affluence]]. It represents the average consumption of each person in the population. As the consumption of each person increases, the total environmental impact increases as well. A common proxy for measuring consumption is through [[GDP per capita]]. While GDP per capita measures production, it is often assumed that consumption increases when production increases.  GDP per capita has been rising steadily over the last few centuries and is driving up human impact in the '''I=PAT''' equation.

====Environmental impacts of affluence====
&lt;!-- Not a great example - needs fleshing out; number of automobiles per capita would be a better example, as it changes, ... --&gt;

Increased consumption significantly increases human environmental impact. This is because each product consumed has wide-ranging effects on the environment. For example, the construction of a car has the following environmental impacts:

* 605,664 gallons of water for parts and tires&lt;ref name ="Phillis"&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Andriantiatsaholiniaina | first1 = L. A. | last2 = Kouikoglou | first2 = V. S. | last3 = Phillis | first3 = Y. A. | doi = 10.1016/j.ecolecon.2003.08.009 | title = Evaluating strategies for sustainable development: Fuzzy logic reasoning and sensitivity analysis |journal = [[Ecological Economics (journal)|Ecological Economics]]| volume = 48 | issue = 2 | pages = 149 | year = 2004 | pmid =  | pmc = }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* 682&amp;nbsp;lbs. of pollution at a mine for the [[lead battery]].&lt;ref name ="Phillis" /&gt;
* 2178&amp;nbsp;lbs. of discharge into water supply for the 22&amp;nbsp;lbs. of copper contained in the car.&lt;ref name ="Phillis" /&gt;

The more cars per capita, the greater the impact.
Ecological impacts of each product are far reaching, increases in consumption quickly result in large impacts on the environment through direct and indirect sources.

===Technology===
{{See also|Environmental technology|Appropriate technology}}

The '''T''' variable in the '''I=PAT''' equation represents how resource intensive the production of affluence is; how much environmental impact is involved in creating, transporting and disposing of the goods, services and amenities used.  Improvements in efficiency can reduce resource intensiveness, reducing the T multiplier.  Since technology can affect environmental impact in many different ways, the unit for '''T''' is often tailored for the situation '''I=PAT''' is being applied to. For example, for a situation where the human impact on climate change is being measured, an appropriate unit for '''T''' might be greenhouse gas emissions per unit of GDP.

====Environmental impacts of technology====
Increases in efficiency can reduce overall environmental impact. However, since '''P''' has increased exponentially, and '''A''' has also increased drastically, the overall environmental impact, '''I''', has still increased.

==Criticism==
[[File:Native American fishing at Willamette Falls.jpg|thumb|Native American Fishing Practices (Low Technology) have a vastly smaller Impact than Industrialized Fishing]]
Criticisms of the "I=PAT" formula
* Too Simplistic for complex problem
* Inter dependencies between variables
* General sweeping assumptions of variables’ effect toward environmental impact
* Cultural differences cause wide variation in impact
* Technology cannot properly be expressed in a unit. Varying the unit will prove to be inaccurate, as the result of the calculation depends on one’s view of the situation

===Interdependencies===
The I=PAT equation has been criticized for being too simplistic by assuming that P, A, and T are independent of each other. In reality, at least 7 interdependencies between P, A, and T could exist, indicating that it is more correct to rewrite the equation as I = f(P,A,T).&lt;ref name="Alcott, B. 2010"&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Alcott | first1 = B. | title = Impact caps: Why population, affluence and technology strategies should be abandoned | doi = 10.1016/j.jclepro.2009.08.001 | journal = [[Journal of Cleaner Production]] | volume = 18 | issue = 6 | pages = 552–560 | year = 2010 | pmid =  | pmc = }}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, a doubling of technological efficiency, or equivalently a reduction of the T-factor by 50%, does not necessarily reduce the environmental impact (I) by 50% if efficiency induced price reductions stimulate additional consumption of the resource that was supposed to be conserved, a phenomenon called the [[rebound effect (conservation)]] or [[Jevons Paradox]].  As was shown by Alcott,&lt;ref name="Alcott, B. 2010" /&gt;{{rp|Fig. 5}} despite significant improvements in the carbon intensity of GDP (i.e., the efficiency in carbon use) since 1980, world fossil energy consumption has increased in line with economic and population growth. Similarly, an extensive historical analysis of technological efficiency improvements has conclusively shown that improvements in the efficiency of energy and material use were almost always outpaced by economic growth, resulting in a net increase in resource use and associated pollution.&lt;ref&gt;Huesemann, Michael H., and Joyce A. Huesemann (2011).

===Neglect of beneficial human impacts===
There have also been comments that this model depicts people as being purely detrimental to the environment, ignoring any [[conservation (ethic)|conservation]] or [[Environmental restoration|restoration]] efforts that societies have made.&lt;ref name=moseley242&gt;{{Cite book |title=An Introduction to Human-Environment Geography: Local Dynamics and Global Processes |last=Moseley |first=William |last2=Perramond |first2=Eric |last3=Hapke |first3=Holly |last4=Laris |first4=Paul |publisher=Wiley Blackwell |year=2014 |isbn=9781405189316 |location=Hoboken, NJ |pages=241–242}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Neglect of political and social contexts===
Another major criticism of the I=PAT model is that it ignores the political context and decision making structures of countries and groups. This means the equation does not account for varying degrees of power, influence, and responsibility of individuals over environmental impact.&lt;ref name=moseley242/&gt; Also, the P factor does not account for the complexity of social structures or behaviors, resulting in blame being placed on the global poor.&lt;ref name=moseley242/&gt; I=PAT does not account for sustainable resource use among some poor and indigenous populations, unfairly characterizing these populations whose cultures support low impact practices.&lt;ref name=moseley242/&gt; However, the latter criticism not only assumes low impacts for indigenous populations, but also misunderstands the I=PAT equation itself. Environmental impact is a function of human numbers, affluence (ie resources consumed per capita) and technology. It is assumed that small scale societies have low environmental impacts due to their practices and orientations alone but there is little evidence to support this&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |title=Primitive polluters : Semang impact on the Malaysian tropical rain forest ecosystem |last=Rambo |first=A. Terry |date=1985 |publisher=Museum of Anthropology, University of Michigan |isbn=0915703041 |location=Ann Arbor, Mich. |oclc=13516436}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |title=The ecological Indian : myth and history |last=Krech |first=Shepard, III |date=1999 |publisher=W.W. Norton &amp; Co |isbn=0393321002 |edition=1st |location=New York |oclc=40762824}}&lt;/ref&gt;. In fact the generally low impact of small scale societies compared to state societies is due to a combination of their small numbers and low level technology. Thus, the environmental sustainability of these societies is largely an epiphenomenon due their ''inability'' to significantly affect their environment&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Smith|first=Eric Alden|last2=Wishnie|first2=Mark|date=2000|title=Conservation and Subsistence in Small-Scale Societies|url=https://doi.org/10.1146/annurev.anthro.29.1.493|journal=Annual Review of Anthropology|volume=29|issue=1|pages=493–524|doi=10.1146/annurev.anthro.29.1.493}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hames|first=Raymond|date=2007|title=The Ecologically Noble Savage Debate|url=https://doi.org/10.1146/annurev.anthro.35.081705.123321|journal=Annual Review of Anthropology|volume=36|issue=1|pages=177–190 |doi=10.1146/annurev.anthro.35.081705.123321}}&lt;/ref&gt;. That all types of societies are subject to I=PAT was actually made clear in Ehrlich and Holdren's 1972 dialogue with Commoner in ''The Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists''&lt;ref name=BAS1/&gt; where they examine the pre-industrial (and indeed prehistoric) impact of human beings on the environment. Their position is further clarified by Holdren's 1993 paper, ''A Brief History of "IPAT"''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://mahb.stanford.edu/blog/review-anthrozoology/|title=Paul Ehrlich reviews Tobias and Morrison’s most recent book –“Anthrozoology: Embracing Co-Existence in the Anthropocene” |date=2017-01-31|work=MAHB|access-date=2018-04-16|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

===Policy implications===
As a result of the interdependencies between P, A, and T and potential rebound effects, policies aimed at decreasing environmental impacts through reductions in P, A, and T may not only be very difficult to implement (e.g., [[population control]] and material sufficiency and [[degrowth]] movements have been very controversial) but also are likely to be rather ineffective compared to rationing (i.e., quotas) or [[Pigovian tax|Pigouvian taxation]] of resource use or pollution.&lt;ref name="Alcott, B. 2010"/&gt;

The '''Institute of Forestry''' ('''IoF''', {{lang-ne|वन विज्ञान अध्ययन संस्थान}}) is one of the five technical institutes under [[Tribhuvan University]], Nepal's largest academic institution. Under the Department of Forests, the IoF was founded as Nepal Forestry Institute in 1947 in [[Singha Durbar]]. However, it was relocated to [[Bhimphedi]] in 1957, then to [[Hetauda]] in 1965, before being incorporated into TU from 1972. The current head office of the institute, usually referred to as the ''dean's office'', is housed at Pokhara Campus.&lt;ref name="iofpc"&gt;{{cite web|title=About us|url=http://www.iofpc.edu.np/about-us|website=iofpc.edu.np|publisher=Institute of Forestry, Pokhara Campus|accessdate=29 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="tu"&gt;{{cite web|title=Institute of Forestry|url=http://tribhuvan-university.edu.np/institutes/institute-of-forestry/|website=tribhuvan-university.edu.np|publisher=[[Tribhuvan University]]|accessdate=29 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The IoF implements forestry-related academic programs through its two constituent campuses, located in [[Pokhara]] and [[Hetauda]].&lt;ref name="edu"&gt;{{cite web|title=Institute of Forestry, Pokhara Campus|url=http://edusanjal.com/college/institute-forestry-pokhara-campus|website=edusanjal.com|accessdate=29 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The current dean of the institute is Krishna Raj Tiwari, and he is backed by two assistant deans, presently Yajna P.

'''Irish Fiscal Advisory Council''' ('''IFAC'''; {{lang-ga|Comhairle Chomhairleach Bhuiséadach na hÉireann}}) is a non-department statutory body providing independent assessment and analysis of the Irish Government's economic and budgetary forecasts, and fiscal approach.  IFAC monitors compliance with EU fiscal rules and agreements.  IFAC was created to counter the "[[green jersey agenda]]" which was identified as a contributor to the Irish financial crisis.

==Purpose==
{{see also|Put on the green jersey}}
IFAC was formed as part of a program of reform of Ireland’s "budgetary architecture" post the Irish economic crisis.  It was established on an interim basis in July 2011, and legally constituted under the Fiscal Responsibility Act 2012&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fiscalcouncil.ie/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/FRA.pdf|title=Fiscal Responsibility Act 2012 | publisher=Department of Finance | date=2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; which was part of the EU-IMF Programme of Financial Support for Ireland (and whose terms required the creation of a "budgetary advisory council to provide an independent assessment of Government forecasts").&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/business/ireland-business-blog-with-lisa-ocarroll/2010/nov/28/ireland-bailout-full-government-statement|title=Ireland bailout: full Irish government statement|publisher=The Guardian|date=28 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fiscalcouncil.ie/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/IFAC_DoF_Forecasting_MoU_2018_Signed.pdf|title=Memorandum of Understanding between the Irish Fiscal Advisory Council and the Department of Finance relating to the “Endorsement Function” of the Council under the Fiscal Responsibility Acts 2012 and 2013|publisher=IFAC Department of Finance|date=January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

The formation of IFAC was a response to the perceived failure of established Irish economic and Irish regulatory institutions to anticipate and warn over the consequences of the Irish credit bubble (i.e. the so-called "[[put on the green jersey|green jersey agenda"]]), and/or engage in the concerns that were being raised by various international monitors at the time (IMF and OECD) regarding Ireland's economic situation.&lt;ref name="OECD"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.independent.ie/irish-news/politics/failure-to-heed-warnings-was-cause-of-crash-trichet-30949719.html|title=Failure to heed warnings was cause of crash: Trichet | publisher=Irish Independent | date=30 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.independent.ie/business/irish/banking-inquiry/fitzgerald-my-regrets-over-crash-are-with-me-until-i-die-30985532.html|title=FitzGerald: My regrets over crash are with me until I die|publisher=Irish Independent|date=12 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

IFAC performs a similar role to the "[[Office for Budget Responsibility]]" in the United Kingdom (also formed after the financial crisis), and other equivalent members of the "[[EU Independent Fiscal Institutions Network|Network of European Union Independent Fiscal Institutions]]" (which IFAC joined in September 2015).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.independent.ie/irish-news/what-is-the-irish-fiscal-advisory-council-for-31277271.html|title=What is the Irish Fiscal Advisory Council for? | publisher=Irish Independent | date=14 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.independent.ie/business/irish/john-mchale-the-man-whose-job-it-is-to-say-no-minister-30087657.html|title=John McHale The man whose job it is to say 'No Minister' | publisher=Irish Independent | date=13 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

IFAC is structured as a Council of 5 members (one Chairperson) and a supporting analytical team of circa 6.&lt;ref name="OECD"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.oecd.org/gov/budgeting/Ireland.pdf|title=Irish Fiscal Advisory Council| publisher=OECD Journal on Budgeting | date=2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://audgen.gov.ie/documents/annualreports/2015/report/en/Chapter18.pdf|title=Irish Fiscal Advisory Council| publisher=C&amp;AG Report 2015 | date=2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The formal mandate of the Irish Fiscal Advisory Council (per IFAC website) is to:
* Assess and endorse the Irish Government’s official macroeconomic forecasts.
* Assess the Irish Government's budgetary forecasts.
* Assess the broader fiscal stance of the Irish Government.
* Monitor compliance with legislated fiscal rules by the Irish Government.

IFAC has been well received by Irish financial commentators and its publications are widely covered in the Irish media.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.irishtimes.com/opinion/editorial/fiscal-advisory-council-s-timely-warning-1.3211833?mode=sample&amp;auth-failed=1&amp;pw-origin=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.irishtimes.com%2Fopinion%2Feditorial%2Ffiscal-advisory-council-s-timely-warning-1.3211833|title=Fiscal Advisory Council’s timely warning|publisher=Irish Times|date=7 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thejournal.ie/fiscal-council-budget-2018-3581853-Sep2017/|title=Fiscal Council says Ireland is still vulnerable and warns against extra Budget spending|publisher=thejournal.ie|date=5 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.independent.ie/business/irish/chairman-fiscal-advisory-council-theres-been-a-very-strong-recovery-we-are-now-living-within-our-means-36500320.html|title=Chairman, Fiscal Advisory Council: 'There's been a very strong recovery - we are now living within our means'|publisher=thejournal.ie|date=18 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.businesspost.ie/opinion/jack-horgan-jones-mchales-advice-ignored-ifac-not-afraid-bare-teeth-371851|title=Even if the government refuses listen, having this kind of analysis in the public domain is vital|publisher=Sunday Business Post|date=30 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.ft.com/content/70b38194-f568-11e3-91a8-00144feabdc0|title=Ireland needs continued austerity says watchdog|publisher=Financial Times|date=June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Publications==

The key mandated publications of the Irish Fiscal Advisory Council are:
* Bi-annual Fiscal Assessment Report (FAR) (produced after the Irish autumn Budget, and the spring Stability Update).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fiscalcouncil.ie/fiscal-assessment-reports/|title=Fiscal Assessment Reports|publisher=Irish Fiscal Advisory Council|date=2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Bi-annual Endorsement Letters of macroeconomic forecasts (produced in advance of the Irish autumn Budget, and the spring Stability Update).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fiscalcouncil.ie/endorsement-letters/|title=Endorsement Letters|publisher=Irish Fiscal Advisory Council|date=2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Irish Fiscal Advisory Council has commenced an annual conference titled “Path for the Public Finances” that was started in March 2017. The goal is to bring attention to long-term Irish State finance issues relevant for Ireland. International speakers attend.  Each annual event is intended to focus on a particular theme, which has been:
* March 2017 Path for the Public Finances: Fiscal Risks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fiscalcouncil.ie/path-for-the-public-finances-2017-fiscal-risks/|title=Path for the Public Finances 2017 Fiscal Risks|publisher=Irish Fiscal Advisory Council|date=2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* March 2018 Path for the Public Finances: Too Hot, Too Cold! The Irish Cycle.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fiscalcouncil.ie/ifac-conference/path-for-the-public-finances-2018-too-hot-too-cold-the-irish-cycle/|title=Path for the Public Finances 2018 Too Hot Too Cold The Irish Cycle|publisher=Irish Fiscal Advisory Council|date=2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

IFAC also publishes Analytical Notes and Working Papers in areas of concern to Irish financial stability (including House Prices, Tax Receipts, Public Debt, and EU Rules/Guidelines).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fiscalcouncil.ie/analytical-notes/|title=IFAC Analytical Notes Series|publisher=Irish Fiscal Advisory Council|date=2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Focus==

The IFAC looks at major areas that could affect the stability and confidence levels of Irish macroeconomic forecasts, and/or, create the potential for economic shocks.

===Distortion of Irish GDP and GNP===
{{see also|Corporate haven#Distorted GDP/GNP|Corporate haven#GDP-per-capita tax haven proxy}}
{{see also|Modified gross national income}}

Ireland is a leading [[corporate tax haven]] (see [[Corporate haven#Corporate tax haven lists|Corporate tax haven lists]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.irishtimes.com/business/economy/ireland-is-the-world-s-biggest-corporate-tax-haven-say-academics-1.3528401?mode=sample&amp;auth-failed=1&amp;pw-origin=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.irishtimes.com%2Fbusiness%2Feconomy%2Fireland-is-the-world-s-biggest-corporate-tax-haven-say-academics-1.3528401|title=Ireland is the world’s biggest corporate ‘tax haven’, say academics|quote=Study claims State shelters more multinational profits than the entire Caribbean|publisher=Irish Times|date=13 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Extreme distortions of national economic data is a well-known feature of [[corporate tax haven]]s.&lt;ref name="qqtz"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://qz.com/1300880/tax-havens-mean-40-of-foreign-direct-investments-are-artificial/|title=How tax havens turn economic statistics into nonsense|publisher=Quartz|date=11 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="imfx"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/fandd/2018/06/inside-the-world-of-global-tax-havens-and-offshore-banking/damgaard.htm|title=Piercing the Veil, FINANCE &amp; DEVELOPMENT, JUNE 2018, VOL. 55, NO. 2 |publisher=IMF Finance &amp; Development|date=June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The top 15 GDP-per-capita countries are heavily represented by traditional and corporate tax havens (see [[Corporate haven#GDP-per-capita tax haven proxy|GDP-per-capita and tax havens]]).  The artificial nature of the distortion makes the haven prone to more severe credit cycles as international capital markets misprice the cost of credit to the tax haven in benign times, only to reverse it sharply in  times of global stress (see [[Corporate haven#Distorted GDP/GNP|tax haven cycles]]).  

{{quote|A stunning $12 trillion—almost 40 percent of all foreign direct investment positions globally—is completely artificial: it consists of financial investment passing through empty corporate shells with no real activity. These investments in empty corporate shells almost always pass through well-known tax havens.

IFAC was one of the members of the economic steering group ((the Economic Statistics Review Group, or "ESRG"), that [[Philip R. Lane]], the Governor of the [[Central Bank of Ireland]], convened to create a new economic statistic to replace Irish GDP.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.cso.ie/en/media/csoie/newsevents/documents/reportoftheeconomicstatisticsreviewgroup/ESRG_Presentation_-_Press_Briefing.pdf|title=ESRG Presentation and CSO Response|publisher=Central Statistics Office|date=4 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.rte.ie/news/analysis-and-comment/2017/0204/850115-leprechaun-economics/|title=Leprechaun-proofing economic data|publisher=RTE News|date=4 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The metric, also called GNI*, is circa 30% below Irish GDP.&lt;ref name="gni1"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.irishtimes.com/business/economy/cso-paints-a-very-different-picture-of-irish-economy-with-new-measure-1.3155462|title=CSO paints a very different picture of Irish economy with new measure|publisher=Irish Times|date=15 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="gni2"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.independent.ie/business/irish/new-economic-leprechaun-on-loose-as-rate-of-growth-plunges-35932663.html|title=New economic Leprechaun on loose as rate of growth plunges|publisher=Irish Independent|date=15 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Quote|Ireland has, more or less, stopped using GDP to measure its own economy. And on current trends [because Irish GDP is distorting EU-28 aggregate data], the eurozone taken as a whole may need to consider something similar.|author=[[Brad Setser]], [[Council on Foreign Relations]], "Ireland exports its Leprechaun", 25 April 2018&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cfr.org/blog/ireland-exports-its-leprechaun|title=Ireland Exports its Leprechaun|publisher=Council on Foreign Relations|date=11 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===Irish Public Debt===
{{see also|Leprechaun economics}}
{{see also|Modified gross national income}}

Ireland's economic data is distorted by the tax planning schemes of US multinationals based in Ireland (i.e. "[[double Irish]]").&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.irishtimes.com/business/economy/europe-points-finger-at-ireland-over-tax-avoidance-1.3417948|title=Europe points finger at Ireland over tax avoidance|publisher=Irish Times|date=7 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;  While traditionally this distortion manifested itself in divergences between Ireland's GDP and GNI&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://economic-incentives.blogspot.ie/2013/04/gdp-and-international-comparisons.html|title=International GNI to GDP Comparisons|publisher=Seamus Coffey, University College Cork|date=29 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;, as the schemes have become more developed (i.e. "[[double Irish|capital allowances for intangibles]]"), Irish GNI and GNP have also become materially distorted.  This was most evident in the "[[leprechaun economics]]" affair when Apple restructured its controversial Irish operations (the subject of the EU Commission's €13bn fine) in January 2015 and Irish GDP rose 26.3% while Irish GNP rose 18.7%.

The problem of assessing Ireland's public indebtedness post "[[leprechaun economics]]" and "[[Modified gross national income|modified GNI]]", is captured on page 34 of the OECD 2018 Ireland Survey:&lt;ref name="oecd"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.finance.gov.ie/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/OECD-survey.pdf|title=OECD Ireland Survey 2018|publisher=OECD|date=March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* On a Gross Public Debt-to-GDP basis, Ireland's 2015 figure at 78.8% is not of concern.
* On a Gross Public Debt-to-GNI* basis, Ireland's 2015 figure at 116.5% is more serious, but not alarming.
* On a Gross Public Debt Per Capita basis, Ireland's 2015 figure at over $62,686 per capita, exceeds every other OECD country, except Japan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.independent.ie/irish-news/politics/national-debt-now-44000-per-head-35904197.html|title=National debt now €44000 per head|publisher=Irish Independent|date=7 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

IFAC introduced a new measure of benchmarking Irish public debt by comparing to Tax Revenues (similar to the Debt-to-EBITDA ratio used in capital markets).  On this basis, Ireland's 2016 Gross Public Debt-to-Tax Revenues is 282.9%, which is the 4th highest of the EU-28 (after Greece, Portugal, and Cyprus).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fiscalcouncil.ie/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/Fiscal-Assessment-Report-June-2017-Presentation.pdf|title=Debt levels remain high following the crisis June FAR Slide 7 | publisher=Irish Fiscal Advisory Council | date=June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fiscalcouncil.ie/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/Fiscal-Assessment-Report-June-2017-Final.pdf|title=Section 1.2.2 Recent Fiscal Context June FAR Page 14  | publisher=Irish Fiscal Advisory Council | date=June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It shows how difficult making Ireland's EU Debt Rule committments will be.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fiscalcouncil.ie/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/Website-AN5.pdf | title=Future Implications of the Debt Rule | publisher=Irish Fiscal Advisory Council | date=June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From this, IFAC advised the Irish Government against using funds, or proceeds from State asset sales, to stimulate the fast-growing Irish economy, and instead use for debt repayment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.rte.ie/news/business/2017/0607/880813-national-debt-it-hasnt-gone-away-you-know/|title=National Debt - it hasn't gone away, you know | publisher=RTE News | date=June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===U.S. Multinationals===

Eurostat (2015)]]
Corporation tax was 15.1% of Irish tax revenues in 2016 with 80% coming from foreign-owned multinationals.&lt;ref name="rev1"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.revenue.ie/en/corporate/documents/research/corporation-tax-returns-2016.pdf|title=An Analysis of 2015 Corporation Tax Returns and 2016 Payments|publisher=Revenue Commissioners|date=April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Irish corporate tax revenue jumped 49% in 2015 alone (from €4.61bn to €6.87bn),&lt;ref name="rev1"/&gt; the year of Apple's Irish restructuring.  This is in an environment where foreign-owned multinationals, attracted to Ireland's corporate tax system, contributed €28.3bn in payments to the Irish economy in 2016 (corporate taxes, wages, and capital spending).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.idaireland.com/newsroom/publications/ireland-s-economic-and-competitiveness-update-q1|title=IDA Ireland Competitiveness|publisher=IDA Ireland|date=March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It is also in an environment where the 2017 US [[Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017|TCJA]] legislation, and the EU "digital tax" (and [[Common Consolidated Corporate Tax Base|CCCTB]]), are threats to the Irish corporate tax system. 

IFAC have reported on the volatility and concentration of Ireland corporation tax payments, with the top 20 payers now making up almost 40% of all corporation tax payments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fiscalcouncil.ie/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/AN-10-Challenges-Forecasting-Irish-Corporation-Tax-Final-Web.pdf|title=Analytical Note 10 Challenges Forecasting Irish Corporation Tax |publisher=Irish Fiscal Advisory Council|date=September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Chairperson of IFAC, Seamus Coffey, was separately commissioned by the Irish Government to review Ireland's Corporate Tax Code.&lt;ref name="coffey1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.finance.gov.ie/updates/minister-donohoe-publishes-review-of-irelands-corporation-tax-code/|title=Minister Donohoe publishes Review of Ireland’s Corporation Tax Code|publisher=Department of Finance|date=21 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="coffey2"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.finance.gov.ie/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/170912-Review-of-Irelands-Corporation-Tax-Code.pdf|title=REVIEW OF IRELAND’S CORPORATION TAX CODE, PRESENTED TO THE MINISTER FOR FINANCE AND PUBLIC EXPENDITURE AND REFORM BY MR. SEAMUS COFFEY|publisher=Department of Finance|date=30 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;  While corporate tax recipts were found to be sustainable for the near future (to 2020),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.irishtimes.com/business/economy/strong-corporate-tax-receipts-sustainable-until-2020-1.3218290?mode=sample&amp;auth-failed=1&amp;pw-origin=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.irishtimes.com%2Fbusiness%2Feconomy%2Fstrong-corporate-tax-receipts-sustainable-until-2020-1.3218290|title=Strong corporate tax receipts ‘sustainable’ until 2020| publisher=Irish Times|date=12 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; it was recommended that some multinational tax allowances be scaled back (i.e. capital allowances capped at 80%) to improve tax revenue sustainability.

IFAC noted Ireland’s exposure to U.S. multinationals in the June 2018 report and the impact of a single multinational leaving.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.independent.ie/business/irish/losing-just-one-big-multinational-would-leave-ireland-nursing-a-276m-tax-shortfall-36981003.html|title=Losing just one big multinational would leave Ireland nursing a €276m tax shortfall|publisher=Irish Independent|date=6 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The high exposure of Ireland's economy to U.S. multinationals (14 of Ireland's top 20 firms, a quarter of the Irish labourforce), is discussed in more detail [[Corporation tax in the Republic of Ireland#Low tax economy|here]].  The former IMF mission chief to Ireland, [[Ashoka Mody]], has emphasised how the changes to international tax regimes (i.e. [[Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017]]), could make this event likely, and on a bigger and synchronised scale (discussed [[Double Irish arrangement#Effect of Tax Cuts and Jobs Act|here]]):

A '''Lally column''' is a round thin-walled [[structural steel]] [[column]] oriented vertically to provide support to [[Beam (structure)|beams]] or timbers stretching over long [[Span (architecture)|spans]]. The steel shell of a Lally column is filled with [[concrete]], which carries a share of the compression load, and helps prevent local buckling of the shell.  The advantage of a Lally column over conventional structural steel is the ability to cut it to length on a construction site with simple [[hand tool]]s such as a plumber’s [[Pipecutter|pipe cutter]] or a reciprocating saw. Lally columns are generally not as strong or durable as conventional structural steel columns. The term "lally column" is sometimes incorrectly used in reference to other types of [[prefabricated]] steel columns.

The Lally column is named after a U. S. inventor, John Lally, who owned a construction company that started production of these columns in the late 19th century.  He resided in [[Waltham, Massachusetts]] and [[Boston]] during the period 1898–1907.  He was issued four U. S. [[Patent]]s on composite columns: #614729, #869869, #901453, and #905888. Pat. #869869 was assigned to the U. S. Column Company of [[Cambridge, Massachusetts]].

Early Lally columns were made with structural steel, "standard" pipes, with wall thicknesses slightly less than 1/4".  Modern Lally columns are typically made with 16 GA (approx. 0.06") shells.  Modern Lallies are therefore much lower in strength than the older ones (typically less than half the strength), and are also much more subject to damage by corrosion in moist environments.  Modern Lally columns are primarily intended as somewhat stronger and more durable substitutes for wood posts in light-frame wood construction, although they are sometimes also used with steel beams.

'''Numerical linear algebra''' is the study of [[algorithms]] for performing [[linear algebra]] computations, most notably [[Matrix (mathematics)|matrix]] operations, on [[computer]]s. It is often a fundamental part of [[engineering]] and [[computational science]] problems, such as [[image processing|image]] and [[signal processing]], [[telecommunication]], [[computational finance]], [[materials science]] simulations, [[structural biology]], [[data mining]], [[bioinformatics]], [[fluid dynamics]], and many other areas.  Such software relies heavily on the development, analysis, and implementation of state-of-the-art algorithms for solving various numerical linear algebra problems, in large part because of the role of matrices in [[finite difference method|finite difference]] and [[finite element method]]s.

Common problems in numerical linear algebra include computing the following: [[LU decomposition]], [[QR decomposition]], [[singular value decomposition]], [[eigenvalue]]s.

==History==
In 1990, leaders attending the [[World Summit for Children]] set the goal of virtually eliminating micronutrient deficiencies.&lt;ref&gt;UNICEF, Plan of Action for Implementing the World Declaration on the Survival, Protection and Development of Children in the 1990s, #13.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1992, ''Micronutrient Initiative'' was established as a secretariat within the [[International Development Research Centre]] (IDRC), based in Ottawa, Ontario, Canada, to support progress toward that goal. In 1993 IDRC recruited an [[executive director]] for the secretariat and transferred 2–3 of its staff to the new organization.&lt;ref&gt;Sanghvi T, Ross J, Heymann H., "Why is reducing vitamin and mineral deficiencies critical for development?" Food and Nutrition Bulletin, 2007, 28(1S), p. 167.&lt;/ref&gt; Venkatesh Mannar took over in June 1994 as the executive director. Until 2000, MI was governed by a steering committee composed of the [[Canadian International Development Agency]] (CIDA), the [[International Development Research Centre]], [[UNICEF]], [[The World Bank]], and [[USAID]]. In 2000, MI became an independent not-for-profit organization.&lt;ref&gt;UNICEF Canada, Global Child Survival and Health: A 50-year Progress Report from UNICEF Canada, p. 68.&lt;/ref&gt; [https://web.archive.org/web/20140415082136/http://www.micronutrient.org/English/view.asp?x=656&amp;id=113 Joel Spicer] became President in February 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.micronutrient.org/English/view.asp?x=656&amp;id=113# |title=Archived copy |access-date=2014-12-18 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140415082136/http://www.micronutrient.org/English/view.asp?x=656&amp;id=113# |archive-date=2014-04-15 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2017, the organization formally rebranded to Nutrition International to more accurately reflect their expanding scope, reach and impact.&lt;ref&gt;http://finance.yahoo.com/news/micronutrient-initiative-now-nutrition-international-130000591.html&lt;/ref&gt;

==Work==
The organization advocates for, and provides funding and technical assistance for [[Iodised salt|salt iodisation]], the distribution of multi-micronutrient powders, the fortification of staple foods such as wheat flour with [[vitamin A]], [[iron]] and [[folic acid]], and dietary supplementation with vitamin A, iron, [[zinc]] and folic acid. Since 1997, with funding support from the Government of Canada, Nutrition International has provided more than [https://web.archive.org/web/20141218234730/http://www.micronutrient.org/English/view.asp?x=656&amp;id=128 eight billion doses] of vitamin A for use by UNICEF and national governments.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.micronutrient.org/English/view.asp?x=656&amp;id=128# |title=Archived copy |access-date=2014-12-18 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141218234730/http://www.micronutrient.org/English/view.asp?x=656&amp;id=128# |archive-date=2014-12-18 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Functional block diagram of orbit determination operations.jpg|thumb|Diagram showing how orbit-de&amp;shy;ter&amp;shy;mi&amp;shy;na&amp;shy;tion data was handled in a 1962 NASA mission. (Of historical interest only.)]]

'''Orbit determination''' is the estimation of [[orbit]]s of objects such as moons, planets, and spacecraft. One major application is to allow tracking newly observed [[asteroid]]s and verify that they have not been previously discovered. The basic methods were discovered in the 17th century and have been continuously refined.

''Observations'' are the raw data fed into orbit determination algorithms.  Observations made by a ground-based observer typically consist of time-tagged [[azimuth]], [[Altitude (astronomy)|elevation]], [[Slant range|range]], and/or range-rate values.  Telescopes or [[radar]] apparatus are used, because naked-eye observations are inadequate for precise orbit determination.

After orbits are determined, mathematical propagation techniques can be used to predict the future positions of orbiting objects.  As time goes by, the actual path of an orbiting object tends to diverge from the predicted path (especially if the object is subject to difficult-to-predict [[Perturbation (astronomy)|perturbations]] such as [[atmospheric drag]]), and a new orbit determination using new observations serves to re-calibrate knowledge of the orbit.

Satellite tracking is another major application. For the [[Federal government of the United States|US]] and partner countries, to the extent that [[United States Space Surveillance Network#Ground-based Electro-Optical Deep Space Surveillance|optical]] and [[Air Force Space Surveillance System|radar]] resources allow, the [[Joint Space Operations Center]] gathers observations of all objects in Earth orbit.  The observations are used in new orbit determination calculations that maintain the overall accuracy of the [[satellite catalog]].  [[Collision avoidance (spacecraft)|Collision avoidance]] calculations may use this data to calculate the probability that one orbiting object will collide with another.  A satellite's operator may decide to adjust the orbit, if the risk of collision in the present orbit is unacceptable.  (It is not possible to adjust the orbit every time a very-low-probability situation is encountered; doing so would cause the satellite to quickly run out of [[propellant]].)  When the quantity or quality of observations improves, the accuracy of the orbit determination process also improves, and fewer "[[False positive|false alarms]]" are brought to the attention of satellite operators.  Other countries, including [[Russia]] and [[China]], have similar tracking assets.

== History ==
Orbit determination has a long history, beginning with the prehistoric discovery of the [[planet]]s and subsequent attempts to predict their motions. [[Johannes Kepler]] used [[Tycho Brahe]]'s careful observations of [[Mars]] to deduce the elliptical shape of its orbit and its orientation in space, deriving his three [[Kepler's laws of planetary motion|laws of planetary motion]] in the process.

The mathematical methods for orbit determination originated with the publication in 1687 of the first edition of [[Isaac Newton|Newton's]] ''[[Philosophiæ Naturalis Principia Mathematica|Principia]]'', which gave a method for finding the orbit of a body following a [[parabola|parabolic]] path from three observations&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.co.uk/books?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;id=UtJK8cetqGkC&amp;oi=fnd&amp;pg=PR5&amp;dq=history+orbital+elements+kepler+newton+halley+ephemerides&amp;ots=WD7wRgz_o6&amp;sig=m52fIr4hILUqBcLqZUD3ItrAuGw#v=onepage&amp;q=halley&amp;f=false Bate RR, Mueller DD, White JE. ''Fundamentals of astrodynamics''. Courier Corporation; 1971. Ch 2 p 51 et seq.]&lt;/ref&gt;. This was used by [[Edmund Halley]] to establish the orbits of various [[comets]], including that which bears his name. Newton's method of successive approximation was formalised into an analytic method by [[Euler]] in 1744, whose work was in turn generalised to elliptical and hyperbolic orbits by [[Johann_Heinrich_Lambert|Lambert]] in 1761-1777. 

Another milestone in orbit determination was [[Carl Friedrich Gauss]]' assistance in the "recovery" of the [[dwarf planet]] [[Ceres (dwarf planet)|Ceres]] in 1801.  [[Gauss' method]] was able to use just three observations (in the form of [[celestial coordinates]]), to find the six [[orbital elements]] that completely describe an orbit.  The theory of orbit determination has subsequently been developed to the point where today it is applied in [[GPS receiver]]s as well as the tracking and cataloguing of newly observed [[minor planet]]s.

In 2019, a new US asset is expected to become operational. The [[Space Fence]]—currently being built—will utilize [[S-band]] radar and will track a larger number of small objects than previous space radars: "about 200,000 objects and make 1.5 million observations per day, about 10 times the number" made by existing or recently retired US assets.&lt;ref name=sn20141121&gt;
{{cite news |last1=Gruss|first1=Mike |title=Haney: U.S. Partners To Have Indirect Access to Space Fence Data |url=http://www.spacenews.com/article/military-space/42619haney-us-partners-to-have-indirect-access-to-space-fence-data |accessdate=2014-12-01 |work=Space News |date=2014-11-21 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Observational data==
In order to determine the unknown orbit of a body, some [[observation]]s of its motion with time are required. In early modern astronomy, the only available observational data for celestial objects were the [[right ascension]] and [[declination]], obtained by observing the body as it moved in its [[observation arc]], relative to the [[fixed stars]]. This corresponds to knowing the object's relative direction in space, measured from the observer, but without knowledge of the distance of the object, i.e. the resultant measurement contains only direction information, like a [[unit vector]].

With [[radar]], relative [[distance]] measurements (by timing of the radar echo) and relative [[velocity]] measurements (by measuring the [[doppler effect]] of the radar echo) are possible. However, the returned signal strength from radar decreases rapidly, as the inverse [[fourth power]] of the range to the object. This limits radar observations to objects relatively near the Earth, such as [[artificial satellite]]s and [[Near-Earth object]]s.

==Methods==
Orbit determination must take into account that the apparent celestial motion of the body is influenced by the observer's own motion. For instance, an observer on Earth tracking an asteroid must take into account both the motion of the Earth around the [[Sun]], the rotation of the Earth, and the observer's local latitude and longitude, as these affect the apparent position of the body.

A key observation is that (to a close approximation) all objects move in orbits that are [[conic section]]s, with the attracting body (such as the Sun or the Earth) in the [[prime focus]], and that the orbit lies in a fixed plane. [[Euclidean vector|Vector]]s drawn from the attracting body to the body at different points in time will all lie in the [[orbital plane (astronomy)|orbital plane]].

===Lambert's method===
If the position and velocity relative to the observer are available (as is the case with radar observations), these observational data can be adjusted by the known position and velocity of the observer relative to the attracting body at the times of observation. This yields the position and velocity with respect to the attracting body. If two such observations are available, along with the time difference between them, the orbit can be determined using Lambert's method.  See [[Lambert's problem]] for details.
&lt;!-- Lambert's method consists of.... --&gt;

===[[Gauss' method]]===
Even if no distance information is available, an orbit can still be determined if three or more observations of the body's right ascension and declination have been made. A method, made famous by Gauss in his "recovery" of the [[dwarf planet]] [[Ceres (dwarf planet)|Ceres]], has been subsequently polished. &lt;!-- until it has become, in the words of Danby "the most beautiful theory in celestial mechanics"{{ref}}. --&gt;
&lt;!-- [[Gauss' Method]] consists of.... --&gt;
&lt;!-- p-iteration method --&gt;
&lt;!-- Refinement --&gt;

One use of this method is in the determination of asteroid masses via the [[dynamic method]].  In this procedure Gauss' method is used twice, both before and after a close interaction between two asteroids.  After both orbits have been determined the mass of one or both of the asteroids can be worked out.{{citation needed|date=May 2012}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6767">{{use dmy dates|date=May 2016}} The '''Organ Reform Movement''' or '''''Orgelbewegung''''' (also called the '''Organ Revival Movement)''' was a mid-20th-century trend in [[pipe organ]] building, originating in Germany. The movement was influential in the United States in the 1930s through 1970s, and began to wane in the 1980s. It arose with early interest in [[historical performance]] and was strongly influenced by [[Albert Schweitzer]]'s championing of historical instruments by [[Gottfried Silbermann]] and others, as well as by Schweitzer's declaration that the criterion for judging an organ is its fitness to perform with clarity the polyphonic [[Baroque]] music of [[J. S. Bach]] (1685–1750). Concert organist [[E. Power Biggs]] was a leading popularizer of the movement in the United States, through his many recordings and radio broadcasts. The movement ultimately went beyond the "Neo-Baroque" copying of old instruments to endorse a new philosophy of [[organ building]], "more Neo than Baroque".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ZL4IAQAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PP1&amp;lpg=PA56 |title=Deutsche und französische Orgelbaukunst und Orgelkunst |year=1906 |first=Albert |last=Schweitzer |publisher=Breitkopf &amp; Härtel |language=German |accessdate=20 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Phelps&gt;{{cite journal |first=Lawrence I. |last=Phelps |title=A Short History of the Organ Revival |journal=Church Music |publisher=Concordia |url=http://LawrencePhelps.com/Documents/Articles/Phelps/ashorthistory.shtml |date=Spring 1967 |volume=67 |issue=1 |accessdate=1 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Ambrosino&gt;{{cite journal |first=Jonathan |last=Ambrosino |title=Present Imperfect |journal=The Tracker |publisher=Organ Historical Society |url=https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/2384349/ambrosino/words-writings.html |date=Spring 1999 |volume=43 |issue=2 |accessdate=23 April 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304065215/https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/2384349/ambrosino/words-writings.html |archivedate=4 March 2016 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.rosales.com/instruments/op11/ |title=Rosales Opus 11: The Trinity Cathedral Organ |first=Barbara |last=Owen |publisher=Trinity Episcopal Cathedral (Portland, Oregon) |date=1987 |accessdate=23 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The movement arose in opposition to the excesses of [[symphonic organ]] building, and eventually symphonic organs regained popularity after the reform movement brought excesses of its own.

The Organ Reform Movement sought to turn away from many of the perceived excesses of [[Aristide Cavaillé-Coll|Romantic]] or [[Symphonic organ]] building and repertoire, in favor of organs understood to be more similar to those of the Baroque Era in Northern Germany, especially those built by [[Arp Schnitger]]. This took the form of a "vertical" style of [[registration (organ)|tonal registration]] in which ensembles were ideally built up with no pitch being duplicated in the same octave, and then the ensembles were crowned with high-pitched [[Mixture (music)|mixture stops]]. The movement endorsed the so-called ''Werkprinzip'', in which each division of the instrument's pipework was based on a [[Flue pipe#Diapasons|principal]]-scale rank of a different octave.&lt;ref name=Phelps/&gt;

Organ voicers strove for an articulate pipe speech characterized by a short burst of "chiff" sound at the start of each note, and avoided "nicking" the pipe edges and other techniques of achieving symphonic-style "smoothness". Low wind pressures were revived. Casework was sometimes eschewed in favor of open standing pipework, and shuttered [[Expression pedal|swell boxes]] became less common.&lt;ref name=Ambrosino/&gt;

In Europe the movement was indelibly connected with [[tracker action]] (mechanical instruments). In North America this was not the case, and many US and Canadian instruments characteristic of the Organ Reform Movement had [[electro-pneumatic]] or [[direct electric action]].&lt;ref name=Phelps/&gt;

Some of the leading organ-builders of the movement were:&lt;ref name=Phelps/&gt;

== Reversals ==
A common criticism of the Organ Reform Movement was that its principles were often taken to extremes that became more dogmatic than musical,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|first=Charles |last=Hendrickson |title=Nicking |journal=The American Organist |publisher=American Guild of Organists |url=http://www.enchamade.com/hendricksonorgan/wb/pages/articles/nicking.php |date=1976 |volume=10 |issue= |accessdate=9 September 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080828024634/http://www.enchamade.com/hendricksonorgan/wb/pages/articles/nicking.php |archivedate=28 August 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; while ruining many fine symphonic organs and disappointing many listeners.&lt;ref name=Gerber/&gt; Some of the alterations that the movement executed on pre-movement instruments have since been reversed to support a wider range of repertoire, such as on the notable pipe organs of [[Auckland Town Hall#Organ|Auckland Town Hall]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Restored Auckland Town Hall organ ready to sing|date=7 March 2010|journal=City Scene|publisher=[[Auckland City Council]]|page=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Princeton University Chapel,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://mander-organs.com/princeton-university-chapel/|title=Princeton University Chapel|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=Mander Organs|accessdate=18 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Chicago's [[Rockefeller Chapel]].&lt;ref name=Gerber&gt;{{cite thesis |last=Gerber |first=James |date=May 2012 |title=Ernest M.

The '''Zeiss-Planetarium''' in [[Jena]], [[Germany]] is the oldest continuously operating [[planetarium]] in the world. It was opened on July 18, 1926. The Zeiss-Planetarium is a projection planetarium. The planets and fixed stars are projected onto the inner surface of a white cupola.

The Zeiss-Planetarium is owned and operated by the [[Ernst-Abbe-Stiftung]].

It was engineered by German engineer [[Walther Bauersfeld]].

'''Pollen''' is a fine to coarse powdery substance comprising pollen grains which are male [[Gametophyte|microgametophytes]] of [[spermatophyta|seed plants]], which produce male [[gamete]]s (sperm cells). Pollen grains have a hard coat made of [[sporopollenin]] that protects the gametophytes during the process of their movement from the [[stamen]]s to the [[gynoecium|pistil]] of flowering plants, or from the male [[Conifer cone|cone]] to the female cone of [[Pinophyta|coniferous plants]]. If pollen lands on a compatible pistil or female cone, it [[germinate]]s, producing a [[pollen tube]] that transfers the [[sperm]] to the [[ovule]] containing the female gametophyte. Individual pollen grains are small enough to require magnification to see detail. The study of pollen is called [[palynology]] and is highly useful in [[paleoecology]], [[paleontology]], [[archaeology]], and [[Forensic science|forensics]].

Pollen in plants is used for transferring haploid male genetic material from the [[Stamen|anther]] of a single flower to the stigma of another in cross-pollination.&lt;ref name=EB1911&gt;{{cite EB1911 |wstitle=Pollination |volume=22 |pages=2–5}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a case of self-pollination, this process takes place from the anther of a flower to the stigma of the same flower.&lt;ref name=EB1911/&gt;

Pollen itself is not the male gamete.&lt;ref name="facts_and_practice_for_a_level"&gt;{{Cite book| last1 = Johnstone | first1 = Adam | title = Biology: facts &amp; practice for A level| year =2001 | publisher = Oxford University Press | location = | isbn = 978-0-19-914766-3 | page = 95 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Each pollen grain contains vegetative (non-reproductive) cells (only a single cell in most flowering plants but several in other seed plants) and a generative (reproductive) cell. In flowering plants the vegetative tube cell produces the [[pollen tube]], and the generative cell divides to form the two sperm cells.

=== Formation ===
Pollen is produced in the [[microsporangia]] in the male cone of a conifer or other [[gymnosperm]] or in the anthers of an [[Flowering plant|angiosperm]] [[flower]]. Pollen grains come in a wide variety of shapes, sizes, and surface markings characteristic of the species (see [[electron micrograph]], right). Pollen grains of [[pine]]s, [[fir]]s, and [[spruce]]s are winged. The smallest pollen grain, that of the [[forget-me-not]] (''Myosotis'' spp.),{{which|date=February 2017}} is around 6&amp;nbsp;[[micrometre|µm]] (0.006&amp;nbsp;mm) in diameter.{{citation  needed|date=February 2017}} Wind-borne pollen grains can be as large as about 90–100&amp;nbsp;µm.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| pmc = 59743 | doi = 10.1073/pnas.211287498 | year = 2001 | title = Corn pollen deposition on milkweeds in and near cornfields | volume = 98 | issue = 21 | pages = 11919–24 | pmid = 11559840 | journal = Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America | last1 = Pleasants| first1 = J.

In angiosperms, during flower development the anther is composed of a mass of cells that appear undifferentiated, except for a partially differentiated dermis. As the flower develops, four groups of sporogenous cells form within the anther. The fertile sporogenous cells are surrounded by layers of sterile cells that grow into the wall of the pollen sac. Some of the cells grow into nutritive cells that supply nutrition for the microspores that form by meiotic division from the sporogenous cells.

In a process called '''microsporogenesis''', four haploid [[microspore]]s are produced from each diploid sporogenous cell (microsporocyte, pollen mother cell or [[meiocyte]]), after [[meiotic division]]. After the formation of the four microspores, which are contained by callose walls, the development of the pollen grain walls begins. The callose wall is broken down by an enzyme called callase and the freed pollen grains grow in size and develop their characteristic shape and form a resistant outer wall called the exine and an inner wall called the intine. The exine is what is preserved in the fossil record. Two basic types of microsporogenesis are recognised, simultaneous and successive. In simultaneous microsporogenesis meiotic steps I and II are completed prior to [[cytokinesis]], whereas in successive microsporogenesis cytokinesis follows. While there may be a continuum with intermediate forms, the type of microsporogenesis has systematic significance. The predominant form amongst the [[monocots]] is successive, but there are important exceptions.&lt;ref name=Furness2001&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Furness|first1=Carol A.|last2=Rudall|first2=Paula J.|authorlink2=Paula Rudall|title=Pollen and anther characters in monocot systematics|journal=Grana|date=January 2001|volume=40|issue=1–2|pages=17–25|doi=10.1080/00173130152591840}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During microgametogenesis, the unicellular microspores undergo mitosis and develop into mature [[microgametophyte]]s containing the gametes.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www2.le.ac.uk/departments/biology/people/twell/lab/pollenis/development Pollen Development — University of Leicester&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; In some flowering plants,{{which|date=February 2017}} [[germination]] of the pollen grain may begin even before it leaves the microsporangium, with the generative cell forming the two sperm cells.

=== Structure ===
Except in the case of some submerged aquatic plants, the mature pollen grain has a double wall. The vegetative and generative cells are surrounded by a thin delicate wall of unaltered [[cellulose]] called the '''endospore''' or '''intine''', and a tough resistant outer cuticularized wall composed largely of [[sporopollenin]] called the '''exospore''' or '''exine'''. The exine often bears spines or warts, or is variously sculptured, and the character of the markings is often of value for identifying genus, species, or even cultivar or individual. The spines may be less than a micron in length (spinulus, plural spinuli) referred to as '''spinulose''' (scabrate), or longer than a micron (echina, echinae) referred to as '''echinate'''. Various terms also describe the sculpturing such as '''reticulate''', a net like appearance consisting of elements (murus, muri) separated from each other by a lumen (plural lumina).

The pollen wall protects the sperm while the pollen grain is moving from the anther to the stigma; it protects the vital genetic material from drying out and solar radiation. The pollen grain surface is covered with waxes and proteins, which are held in place by structures called sculpture elements on the surface of the grain. The outer pollen wall, which prevents the pollen grain from shrinking and crushing the genetic material during desiccation, is composed of two layers. These two layers are the tectum and the foot layer, which is just above the intine. The tectum and foot layer are separated by a region called the columella, which is composed of strengthening rods. The outer wall is constructed with a resistant biopolymer called sporopollenin.

Pollen apertures are regions of the pollen wall that may involve exine thinning or a significant reduction in exine thickness.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Furness|first=Carol A.|last2=Rudall|first2=Paula J.|date=2004-03-01|title=Pollen aperture evolution--a crucial factor for eudicot success?|journal=Trends in Plant Science|volume=9|issue=3|pages=154–158|doi=10.1016/j.tplants.2004.01.001|pmid=15003239|citeseerx=10.1.1.462.5084}}&lt;/ref&gt; They allow shrinking and swelling of the grain caused by changes in moisture content. Elongated apertures or furrows in the pollen grain are called colpi (singular: colpus) or sulci (singular: [[Sulcus (morphology)|sulcus]]). Apertures that are more circular are called pores. Colpi, sulci and pores are major features in the identification of classes of pollen.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.geo.arizona.edu/palynology/ppapertr.html|author=Davis, Owen |title=Aperture|work=geo.arizona.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pollen may be referred to as '''inaperturate''' (apertures absent) or '''aperturate''' (apertures present).

The transfer of pollen grains to the female reproductive structure ('''''[[Carpel|pistil]]''''' in angiosperms) is called '''[[pollination]]'''. This transfer can be mediated by the wind, in which case the plant is described as '''[[Anemophily|anemophilous]]''' (literally wind-loving). Anemophilous plants typically produce great quantities of very lightweight pollen grains, sometimes with air-sacs. Non-flowering seed plants (e.g., pine trees) are characteristically anemophilous. Anemophilous flowering plants generally have inconspicuous flowers. '''[[Entomophily|Entomophilous]]''' (literally insect-loving) plants produce pollen that is relatively heavy, sticky and [[protein]]-rich, for dispersal by [[insect]] [[pollinator]]s attracted to their flowers. Many insects and some [[mite]]s are specialized to feed on pollen, and are called [[palynivore]]s.

In non-flowering seed plants, pollen germinates in the pollen chamber, located beneath the [[Ovule|micropyle]], underneath the integuments of the ovule. A [[pollen tube]] is produced, which grows into the [[nucellus]] to provide nutrients for the developing sperm cells. Sperm cells of [[Pinophyta]] and [[Gnetophyta]] are without [[flagella]], and are carried by the pollen tube, while those of [[Cycad]]ophyta and [[Ginkgophyta]] have many flagella.

When placed on the [[Carpel|stigma]] of a flowering plant, under favorable circumstances, a pollen grain puts forth a [[pollen tube]], which grows down the tissue of the style to the [[ovary (plants)|ovary]], and makes its way along the [[placenta]], guided by projections or hairs, to the micropyle of an [[ovule]]. The nucleus of the tube cell has meanwhile passed into the tube, as does also the generative nucleus, which divides (if it hasn't already) to form two sperm cells. The sperm cells are carried to their destination in the tip of the [[pollen tube]]. Double-strand breaks in DNA that arise during [[pollen tube]] growth appear to be efficiently [[DNA repair|repaired]] in the generative cell that carries the male [[genome|genomic information]] to be passed on to the next plant generation.&lt;ref name="pmid23550213"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Hirano T, Takagi K, Hoshino Y, Abe T |title=DNA damage response in male gametes of Cyrtanthus mackenii during pollen tube growth |journal=AoB Plants |volume=5 |issue= |pages=plt004 |year=2013 |pmid=23550213 |pmc=3583183 |doi=10.1093/aobpla/plt004 |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  However, the vegetative cell that is responsible for tube elongation appears to lack this [[DNA repair]] capability.&lt;ref name="pmid23550213" /&gt;

==Pollen in the fossil record==
{{Main article|Palynology}}
Pollen's sporopollenin outer sheath affords it some resistance to the rigours of the fossilisation process that destroy weaker objects; it is also produced in huge quantities. There is an extensive fossil record of pollen grains, often disassociated from their parent plant. The discipline of palynology is devoted to the study of pollen, which can be used both for biostratigraphy and to gain information about the abundance and variety of plants alive — which can itself yield important information about paleoclimates. Also, pollen analysis has been widely used for reconstructing past changes in vegetation and their associated drivers &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Franco-Gaviria |first=Felipe et al. |title=The human impact imprint on modern pollen spectra of the Mayan lands |year=2018 |publisher=[[Boletín de la Sociedad Geológica Mexicana 70, 1]] |pages=61–78 |url=http://boletinsgm.igeolcu.unam.mx/bsgm/vols/epoca04/7001/%284%29Franco.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

==Allergy to pollen==

}}
[[Allergic rhinitis|Nasal allergy]] to pollen is called [[pollinosis]], and allergy specifically to grass pollen is called [[hay fever]]. Generally, pollens that cause allergies are those of anemophilous plants (pollen is dispersed by air currents.) Such plants produce large quantities of lightweight pollen (because wind dispersal is random and the likelihood of one pollen grain landing on another flower is small), which can be carried for great distances and are easily inhaled, bringing it into contact with the sensitive nasal passages.

Pollen allergies are common in polar and temperate climate zones, where production of pollen is seasonal. In the tropics pollen production varies less by the season, and allergic reactions less.
In northern Europe, common pollens for allergies are those of [[birch]] and [[alder]], and in late summer [[Artemisia vulgaris|wormwood]] and different forms of [[hay]]. Grass pollen is also associated with [[Asthma|asthma exacerbations]] in some people, a phenomenon termed [[Thunderstorm asthma|thunderstorm asthma]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Erbas|first=B.|last2=Jazayeri|first2=M.|last3=Lambert|first3=K.

In the US, people often mistakenly blame the conspicuous [[goldenrod]] flower for allergies. Since this plant is entomophilous (its pollen is dispersed by animals), its heavy, sticky pollen does not become independently airborne. Most late summer and fall pollen allergies are probably caused by [[ragweed]], a widespread anemophilous plant.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Oder|first1=Tom|title=Dear allergy sufferers: Don't blame goldenrod|url=http://www.mnn.com/health/allergies/stories/dear-allergy-sufferers-dont-blame-goldenrod|website=mnn.com|publisher=Mother Nature Network|accessdate=18 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Arizona]] was once regarded as a haven for people with pollen allergies, although several ragweed species grow in the desert. However, as suburbs grew and people began establishing [[irrigation|irrigated lawns and gardens]], more irritating species of ragweed gained a foothold and Arizona lost its claim of freedom from hay fever.

Anemophilous spring blooming plants such as [[oak]], [[birch]], [[hickory]], [[pecan]], and early summer [[grass]]es may also induce pollen allergies. Most cultivated plants with showy flowers are entomophilous and do not cause pollen allergies.

The number of people in the United States affected by hay fever is between 20 and 40 million,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Skoner|first1=DP|title=Allergic rhinitis: definition, epidemiology, pathophysiology, detection, and diagnosis.|journal=The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology|date=July 2001|volume=108|issue=1 Suppl|pages=S2–8|pmid=11449200|doi=10.1067/mai.2001.115569}}&lt;/ref&gt; and such allergy has proven to be the most frequent [[allergic response]] in the nation. There are certain evidential suggestions pointing out hay fever and similar allergies to be of [[Hereditary disease|hereditary origin]]. Individuals who suffer from [[eczema]] or are [[asthma]]tic tend to be more susceptible to developing long-term hay fever.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.webmd.com/allergies/living-with-allergies-10/rhinitis Allergies and Hay Fever] WebMD. Retrieved on 2010-03-09&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Denmark]], decades of rising temperatures cause pollen to appear earlier and in greater numbers, as well as introduction of new species such as ragweed.&lt;ref&gt;Siewertsen, Bjarne. "[http://www.dmi.dk/nyheder/arkiv/nyheder-2015/04/haard-nyser-for-allergikere-i-varm-fremtid/ Hård nyser for allergikere i varm fremtid]"  (English: Hard sneeze for allergic people in warm future) ''[[Danish Meteorological Institute]]'', 18 April 2015. Retrieved: 19 April 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

The most efficient way to handle a pollen allergy is by preventing contact with the material. Individuals carrying the ailment may at first believe that they have a simple summer cold, but hay fever becomes more evident when the apparent cold does not disappear. The confirmation of hay fever can be obtained after examination by a [[General practitioner|general physician]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.allergiesandtreatments.com/pollen-allergy/ Bee, grass pollen allergy symptoms]. allergiesandtreatments.com. Retrieved on 2010-03-09&lt;/ref&gt;

===Treatment===
{{main article|Allergic rhinitis#treatment}}
[[Antihistamines]] are effective at treating mild cases of pollinosis, this type of non-prescribed drugs includes [[loratadine]], [[cetirizine]] and [[chlorpheniramine]]. They do not prevent the discharge of [[histamine]], but it has been proven that they do prevent a part of the chain reaction activated by this [[biogenic amine]], which considerably lowers hay fever symptoms.

[[Decongestants]] can be administered in different ways such as tablets and [[nasal spray]]s.

[[Allergen immunotherapy|Allergy immunotherapy]] (AIT) treatment involves administering doses of allergens to accustom the body to pollen, thereby inducing specific long-term tolerance.&lt;ref&gt;Van Overtvelt L. et al. Immune mechanisms of allergen-specific sublingual immunotherapy. Revue française d'allergologie et d'immunologie clinique. 2006; 46: 713–720.&lt;/ref&gt; Allergy immunotherapy can be administered orally (as sublingual tablets or sublingual drops), or by injections under the skin (subcutaneous). Discovered by Leonard Noon and John Freeman in 1911, allergy immunotherapy represents the only causative treatment for respiratory allergies.

==Nutrition==
Most major classes of [[predatory]] and [[parasitic]] [[arthropod]]s contain species that eat pollen, despite the common perception that [[bee]]s are the primary pollen-consuming arthropod group. Many other [[Hymenoptera]] other than bees consume pollen as adults, though only a small number feed on pollen as [[larva]]e (including some [[ant]] larvae). [[Spider]]s are normally considered [[carnivore]]s but pollen is an important source of food for several species, particularly for [[spider]]lings, which catch pollen on their [[spider web|webs]]. It is not clear how spiderlings manage to eat pollen however, since their mouths are not large enough to consume pollen grains.{{citation needed|date=April 2012}} Some [[Acari|predatory mites]] also feed on pollen, with some species being able to subsist solely on pollen, such as ''[[Euseius tularensis]]'', which feeds on the pollen of dozens of plant species. Members of some beetle families such as [[Mordellidae]] and [[Melyridae]] feed almost exclusively on pollen as adults, while various lineages within larger families such as [[Curculionidae]], [[Chrysomelidae]], [[Cerambycidae]], and [[Scarabaeidae]] are pollen specialists even though most members of their families are not (e.g., only 36 of 40000 species of [[Carabidae|ground beetle]]s, which are typically predatory, have been shown to eat pollen—but this is thought to be a severe underestimate as the feeding habits are only known for 1000 species). Similarly, [[Ladybird]] beetles mainly eat insects, but many species also eat pollen, as either part or all of their diet. [[Hemiptera]] are mostly [[herbivore]]s or [[omnivore]]s but pollen feeding is known (and has only been well studied in the [[Anthocoridae]]). Many adult flies, especially [[Syrphidae]], feed on pollen, and three UK syrphid species feed strictly on pollen (syrphids, like all [[Fly|flies]], cannot eat pollen directly due to the structure of their mouthparts, but can consume pollen contents that are dissolved in a fluid).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| chapter = The Pollen Feeders| title = Relationships of Natural Enemies and Non-Prey Foods| volume = 7| pages = 87–11| year = 2009| isbn = 978-1-4020-9234-3| doi = 10.1007/978-1-4020-9235-0_6| last1 = Lundgren| first1 = Jonathan G.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some species of fungus, including ''[[Fomes fomentarius]]'', are able to break down grains of pollen as a secondary nutrition source that is particularly high in nitrogen.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= Fungal Strategies of Wood Decay in Trees|author= Schwarze, Francis W.

The [[U.S. Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA) has not found any harmful effects of bee pollen consumption, except from the usual allergies. However, FDA does not allow bee pollen marketers in the United States to make health claims about their produce, as no scientific basis for these has ever been proven. Furthermore, there are possible dangers not only from allergic reactions but also from contaminants such as pesticides and from fungi and bacteria growth related to poor storage procedures. A manufacturers's claim that pollen collecting helps the bee colonies is also controversial.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url = http://edis.ifas.ufl.edu/AA158| archiveurl = http://ufdc.ufl.edu/IR00004421/00001| title = Producing Pollen | author = Sanford, Malcolm T. | publisher = University of Florida, Institute of Food and Agricultural Sciences | accessdate=2007-08-30}}.

== Spiritual purposes ==
In some [[Native American religion]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;s, pollen is used in [[prayer]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;s and rituals to symbolize life and renewal by [[sanctifying]] objects, dancing grounds, trails, and [[sandpainting]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;s. It may also be sprinkled over heads or in mouths.

[[Image:Einstein theory triumphs.png|right|thumb|150px|''[[The New York Times]]'' of November 10, 1919, reported on Einstein's confirmed prediction of [[gravitation]] on space, called the [[gravitational lens]] effect.]]

The concept of '''predictive power''' differs from [[explanatory power|explanatory]] and [[descriptive power]] (where phenomena that are already known are retrospectively explained or described by a given theory) in that it allows a prospective test of theoretical understanding.

==Examples==
A classic example of the predictive power of a theory is the [[discovery of Neptune]] as a result of predictions made by mathematicians [[John Couch Adams]] and [[Urbain Le Verrier]], based on Newton's theory of gravity.

Another example of the predictive power of theories or models is [[Dmitri Mendeleev]]'s use of his [[periodic table]] to predict previously undiscovered [[chemical element]]s and their properties. Though largely correct, he misjudged the relative atomic masses of [[tellurium]] and [[iodine]].

Moreover, [[Charles Darwin]] used his knowledge of [[evolution]] by [[natural selection]] to predict that since a plant (''[[Angraecum sesquipedale]]'') with a long spur in its flowers exists, a complementary animal with a 30&amp;nbsp;cm [[proboscis]] must also exist to feed on and [[pollination|pollinate]] it. Twenty years after his death, a form of [[hawk moth]] (''[[Xanthopan]] morganii'') that did just that was found.{{Citation needed|date=May 2014}}

Another example of predictive power is the prediction of [[Albert Einstein|Einstein]]'s theory of [[general relativity]] that the path of light would bend in the presence of a strong gravitational field. This was [[Tests of general relativity#Deflection of light by the Sun|experimentally verified]] by an expedition to [[Sobral, Ceará|Sobral]] in [[Brazil]] and the [[Atlantic Ocean|Atlantic]] island of [[Príncipe]] to measure star positions during the solar eclipse of May 29, 1919, when observations made by the astrophysicist [[Arthur Eddington]] seemed to confirm Einstein's predictions.&lt;ref&gt;F. W. Dyson, A. S. Eddington, and C. Davidson, "A Determination of the Deflection of Light by the Sun's Gravitational Field, from Observations Made at the Total Eclipse of May 29, 1919," ''Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society of London. Series A,'' Volume 220 (1920) pp. 291-333 (available [http://www.journals.royalsoc.ac.uk/content/l30l04qu5m012r87/ online from the Royal Society]{{dead link|date=March 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }})&lt;/ref&gt; Although the measurements have been criticized by some as utilizing flawed methodology,&lt;ref&gt;[[Harry Collins]] and [[Trevor Pinch]], ''The Golem: What Everyone Should Know About Science,'' Cambridge University Press, 1993. ({{ISBN|0521477360}})&lt;/ref&gt; modern reanalysis of the data&lt;ref&gt;Daniel Kennefick, "Not Only Because of Theory: Dyson, Eddington and the Competing Myths of the 1919 Eclipse Expedition," ''Proceedings of the 7th Conference on the History of General Relativity'', Tenerife, 2005; available [http://xxx.arxiv.org/abs/0709.0685 online from ArXiv]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Phillip Ball, "Arthur Eddington Was Innocent," ''Nature,'' 7 September 2007, {{doi|10.1038/news070903-20}} (available [http://philipball.blogspot.com/2007/09/arthur-eddington-was-innocent-this-is.html online] 2007)&lt;/ref&gt; suggests that Eddington's analysis of the data was accurate. Later, more precise measurements taken by [[radio astronomy|radio]] [[interferometry]] confirmed the predictions to a high degree of accuracy.

== Applications ==
The predictive power of a theory is closely related to applications. {{according to whom|date=April 2013}}

General relativity not only predicts the bending of light, but also predicts several other phenomena. Recently, the calculation of [[proper time]] of [[satellite]]s has been a successfully-measured prediction, now incorporated into the method used to calculate positions via [[GPS]].

If a theory has no predictive power, it cannot be used for applications.{{citation needed|date=April 2013}}

[[File:ENTERAIR6-SPENB.jpg|thumb|[[Boeing 737]] [[Enter Air]], climbing with normal [[angle of attack]] for civil airplanes, to give optimal rate of climb]]
In [[aeronautics]], the '''rate of climb''' ('''RoC''') is an aircraft's vertical speed – the rate of positive [[altitude]] change with respect to time or distance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.flyingmag.com/technique/tip-week/vx-vs-vy|title=Vx vs. Vy|author=|date=|website=flyingmag.com|accessdate=16 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In most [[ICAO]] member countries, even in otherwise metric countries, this is usually expressed in feet per [[minute]] (ft/min). Elsewhere, it is commonly expressed in metre per [[second]] (m/s). The rate of climb in an aircraft is indicated with a [[vertical speed indicator]] (VSI) or instantaneous vertical speed indicator (IVSI).

The rate of decrease in altitude is referred to as the '''rate of descent''' ('''RoD''') or '''sink rate'''. A decrease in altitude corresponds with a negative rate of climb.

== Speed and rate of climb ==

There are a number of [[V speeds|designated airspeeds]] relating to optimum rates of ascent, the two most important of these are ''V&lt;sub&gt;X&lt;/sub&gt;'' and ''V&lt;sub&gt;Y&lt;/sub&gt;''.

''V&lt;sub&gt;X&lt;/sub&gt;'' is the indicated forward airspeed for best [[angle of climb]]. This is the speed at which an aircraft gains the most altitude in a given horizontal {{em|distance}}, typically used to avoid a collision with an object a short distance away. By contrast, ''V&lt;sub&gt;Y&lt;/sub&gt;'' is the indicated airspeed for best rate of climb,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ecfr.gpoaccess.gov/cgi/t/text/text-idx?c=ecfr;sid=4521512ee412f38bd81b10e0436a0a95;rgn=div5;view=text;node=14%3A1.0.1.1.1;idno=14;cc=ecfr#14:1.0.1.1.1.0.1.2|title=FAR §1.2|author=|date=|website=gpoaccess.gov|accessdate=16 March 2018|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120319210119/http://ecfr.gpoaccess.gov/cgi/t/text/text-idx?c=ecfr;sid=4521512ee412f38bd81b10e0436a0a95;rgn=div5;view=text;node=14:1.0.1.1.1;idno=14;cc=ecfr#14:1.0.1.1.1.0.1.2|archivedate=19 March 2012|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
a rate which allows the aircraft to climb to a specified altitude in the minimum amount of {{em|time}} regardless of the horizontal distance required. Except at the aircraft’s ceiling, where they are equal, ''V&lt;sub&gt;X&lt;/sub&gt;'' is always lower than ''V&lt;sub&gt;Y&lt;/sub&gt;''.

Climbing at ''V&lt;sub&gt;X&lt;/sub&gt;'' allows pilots to maximize altitude gain per horizontal distance. This occurs at the speed for which the difference between thrust and [[aerodynamic drag|drag]] is the greatest (maximum [[excess thrust]]). In a jet airplane, this is approximately minimum drag speed, occurring at the bottom of the drag vs. speed curve.

Climbing at ''V&lt;sub&gt;Y&lt;/sub&gt;'' allows pilots to maximize altitude gain per time. This occurs at the speed where the difference between engine power and the power required to overcome the aircraft's drag is greatest (maximum excess power).&lt;ref&gt;http://people.clarkson.edu/~pmarzocc/AE429/AE-429-10.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

''V&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;'' increases with altitude and ''V&lt;sub&gt;Y&lt;/sub&gt;'' decreases with altitude until they converge at the airplane's [[absolute ceiling]], the altitude above which the airplane cannot climb in steady flight.

The [[Cessna 172]] is a four-seat aircraft. At maximum weight it has a ''V&lt;sub&gt;Y&lt;/sub&gt;'' of 75&amp;nbsp;knots [[indicated airspeed]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.flashcardmachine.com/cessna-172-ataglance.html|title=Cessna 172 at a Glance Flashcards|author=|date=|website=www.flashcardmachine.com|accessdate=16 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
providing a rate of climb of 721&amp;nbsp;ft/min.

Rate of climb at maximum power for a small aircraft is typically specified in its normal operating procedures but for large jet airliners it is usually mentioned in emergency operating procedures.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9011">A '''reference designator''' unambiguously identifies a [[Electronic component|component]] in an [[circuit diagram|electrical schematic]] or on a [[printed circuit board]]. The reference designator usually consists of one or two letters followed by a number, e.g. R13, C1002. The number is sometimes followed by a letter, indicating that components are grouped or matched with each other, e.g. R17A, R17B.
IEEE 315 contains a list of Class Designation Letters to use for electrical and electronic assemblies. For example, the letter R is a reference prefix for the resistors of an assembly, C for capacitors, K for relays.

== History ==

IEEE 200-1975 or "Standard Reference Designations for Electrical and Electronics Parts and Equipments" is a standard that was used to define referencing naming systems for collections of electronic equipment. IEEE 200 was ratified in 1975.  The IEEE renewed the standard in the 1990s, but withdrew it from active support shortly thereafter. This document also has an ANSI document number, ANSI Y32.16-1975.

This standard codified information from, among other sources, a United States military standard MIL-STD-16 which dates back to at least the 1950s in American industry.

To replace IEEE 200-1975, [[ASME]], a standards body for mechanical engineers, initiated the new standard ASME Y14.44-2008. This standard, along with IEEE 315-1975, provide the electrical designer with guidance on how to properly reference and annotate everything from a single circuit board to a collection of complete enclosures.

== Definition ==

ASME Y14.44-2008&lt;ref name="ASME-Y14.44-2008"&gt;{{cite book | title = Reference Designations for Electrical and Electronics Parts and Equipment: ASME Y14.44-2008 (Replaced IEEE 200-1975) | publisher = ASME, Fairfield, NJ | year = 2008 | url = https://www.asme.org/products/codes-standards/reference-designations-for-electrical-and-electron}}&lt;/ref&gt; and IEEE 315-1975&lt;ref name="IEEE-315-1975"&gt;{{Citation | last = IEEE | date = 1975 | title = IEEE Std 315-1975: Graphic Symbols for Electrical and Electronics Diagrams (Including Reference Designation Letters) (Reaffirmed 1993) | chapter = 22. Class Designation Letters | publisher = IEEE and ANSI, New York, NY }}&lt;/ref&gt; define how to reference and annotate components of electronic devices.

It breaks down a system into units, and then any number of sub-assemblies.  The unit is the highest level of demarcation in a system and is always a numeral.  Subsequent demarcation are called assemblies and always have the Class Letter "A" as a prefix following by a sequential number starting with 1.  Any number of sub-assemblies may be defined until finally reaching the component. Note that IEEE-315-1975&lt;ref name="IEEE-315-1975" /&gt; defines separate class designation letters for ''separable'' assemblies (class designation 'A') and ''inseparable'' assemblies (class designation 'U'). Inseparable assemblies&amp;mdash;i.e., "items which are ordinarily replaced as a single item of supply"&lt;ref name="IEEE-315-1975" /&gt;&amp;mdash;are typically treated as components in this referencing scheme.

Examples:
* 1A12A2R3 - Unit 1, Assembly 12, Sub-assembly 2, Resistor 3
* 1A12A2U3 - Unit 1, Assembly 12, Sub-assembly 2, Inseparable Assembly 3

Especially valuable is the method of referencing and annotating cables plus their connectors within and outside assemblies.
Examples:
* 1A1A44J5 - Unit 1, Assembly 1, Sub-Assembly 44, Jack 5 (J5 is a connector on a box referenced as A44)
* 1A1A45J333 - Unit 1, Assembly 1, Sub-Assembly 45, Jack 333 (J333 is a connector on a box referenced as A45)

A cable connecting these two might be:
* 1A1W35 - In the assembly A1 is a cable called W35.

Connectors on this cable  would be designated:
* 1A1W35P1
* 1A1W35P2

ASME Y14.44-2008 continues the  convention of [[plug (connector)|Plug]] P and [[jack (connector)|Jack]] J when assigning references for [[electrical connector]]s in assemblies where a J (or [[jack (connector)|jack]]) is the more fixed and P (or plug) is the less fixed of a connector pair, without regard to the [[Gender of connectors and fasteners|gender]] of the connector contacts.

The construction of reference designators is covered by IEEE 200-1975/ANSI Y32.16-1975&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title = Standard Reference Designations for Electrical and Electronics Parts and Equipments: IEEE 200-1975 (Reaffirmed 1988): Section 4.1.5.3 (2) | publisher = IEEE and ANSI, New York, NY | year = 1975 | url = }}&lt;/ref&gt; (replaced by ASME Y14.44-2008&lt;ref name="ASME-Y14.44-2008" /&gt;) and IEEE-315-1975.&lt;ref name="IEEE-315-1975" /&gt; The table below lists designators commonly used, and does not necessarily comply with the standard.

'''Registration, Evaluation, Authorisation and Restriction of Chemicals''' ('''REACH''') is a [[European Union regulation]] dating from 18 December 2006.&lt;ref&gt;Full title: Regulation (EC) No 1907/2006 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 18 December 2006 concerning the Registration, Evaluation, Authorisation and Restriction of Chemicals (REACH), establishing a European Chemicals Agency.&lt;/ref&gt; REACH addresses the production and use of [[chemical substance]]s, and their potential impacts on both human health and the environment.  Its 849 pages took seven years to pass, and it has been described as the most complex legislation in the Union's history&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title=EU's REACH chemicals law begins life in Helsinki | date=31 May 2007 | publisher=EUobserver.com | url=http://euobserver.com/9/24169}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the most important in 20 years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title=Q&amp;A: Reach chemicals legislation | date=28 November 2005 | publisher=BBC News | url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/4437304.stm}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is the strictest law to date regulating chemical substances and will affect industries throughout the world.&lt;ref name="US affected"&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2006/12/14/MNGR2MV8UT1.DTL&amp;hw=toxic+chemicals&amp;sn=001&amp;sc=1000 | title=European Parliament OKs world's toughest law on toxic chemicals | date=14 December 2006 | publisher=San Francisco Chronicle | first=Marla | last=Cone}}&lt;/ref&gt; REACH entered into force on 1 June 2007, with a phased implementation over the next decade. The regulation also established the [[European Chemicals Agency]], which manages the technical, scientific and administrative aspects of REACH.

==Overview==
[[File:European Chemicals Agency.jpg|{{largethumb}}|left|[[European Chemicals Agency]] headquarters in {{ill|Annankatu (Helsinki)|fi}}.]]

When REACH is fully in force, it will require all companies manufacturing or importing chemical substances into the European Union in quantities of one [[tonne]] or more per year to register these substances with a new [[European Chemicals Agency]] (ECHA) in {{ill|Annankatu (Helsinki)|fi}}, [[Finland]]. Since REACH applies to some substances that are contained in objects (''articles'' in REACH terminology), any company importing goods into Europe could be affected.&lt;ref name="US affected"/&gt;

The [[European Chemicals Agency]] has set three major deadlines for registration of chemicals. In general these are determined by tonnage manufactured or imported, with 1000 tonnes/a. being required to be registered by 1 December 2010, 100 tonnes/a. by 1 June 2013 and 1 tonne/a. by 1 June 2018.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.reagent.co.uk/blog/what-is-reach/|title=What is REACH? – ReAgent Chemical Services|date=6 February 2012|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, chemicals of higher concern or toxicity also have to meet the 2010 deadline.

About 143,000 chemical substances marketed in the European Union were pre-registered by the 1 December 2008 deadline. Although pre-registering was not mandatory, it allows potential registrants much more time before they have to fully register. Supply of substances to the European market which have not been pre-registered or registered is illegal (known in REACH as "no data, no market").

REACH also addresses the continued use of chemical ''[[substance of very high concern|substances of very high concern]]'' (SVHC) because of their potential negative impacts on human health or the environment. From 1 June 2011, the European Chemicals Agency must be notified of the presence of SVHCs in articles if the total quantity used is more than one tonne per year and the SVHC is present at more than 0.1% of the mass of the object. Some uses of SVHCs may be subject to prior authorisation from the European Chemicals Agency, and applicants for authorisation will have to include plans to replace the use of the SVHC with a safer alternative (or, if no safer alternative exists, the applicant must work to find one) - known as ''substitution''. {{As of|2015|06|15}}, there are 168 SVHCs on the candidate list for authorization.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

&lt;/ref&gt;

REACH applies to all [[Chemical substance|chemicals]] imported or produced in the EU. The European Chemicals Agency will manage the technical, [[Science|scientific]] and administrative aspects of the REACH system.

To somewhat simplify the registration of the 143,000 substances and to limit vertebrate animal testing as far as possible, substance information exchange forums (SIEFs) are formed amongst legal entities (such as manufacturers, importers, and data holders) who are dealing with the same substance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://echa.europa.eu/sief_en.asp |title=Substance Information Exchange Fora&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt; |publisher=[[European Chemicals Agency]] |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091223062045/http://echa.europa.eu/sief_en.asp |archivedate=2009-12-23 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; This allows them to join forces and finances to create 1 registration dossier. However, this creates a series of new problems as a SIEF is the cooperation between sometimes a thousand legal entities that did not know each other at all before but suddenly must:
*find each other and start communicating openly and honestly
*start sharing data
*start sharing costs in a fair and transparent way
*democratically and in full consensus take the most complex decisions
in order to complete a several thousand end points dossier in a limited time.

The [[European Commission]] supports businesses affected by REACH by handing out &amp;ndash; free of charge &amp;ndash; a software application ([[IUCLID]]) that simplifies capturing, managing, and submitting data on chemical properties and effects. Such submission is a mandatory part of the [[REACh authorisation procedure|registration process]]. Under certain circumstances the performance of a [[chemical safety assessment]] (CSA) is mandatory and a [[chemical safety report]] (CSR) assuring the safe use of the substance has to be submitted with the dossier. Dossier submission is done using the web-based software [[REACH-IT]].

The aim of REACH is to improve the protection of human health and the environment by identification of the intrinsic properties of chemical substances. At the same time, innovative capability and competitiveness of the EU chemicals industry should be enhanced.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Reach|url = http://www.teppfa.eu/reach/|website = TEPPFA|accessdate = 2015-12-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
The European Commission’s (EC) White Paper of 2001 on a ‘future chemical strategy’ proposed a system that requires chemicals manufactured in quantities of greater than 1 tonne to be ‘registered’, those manufactured in quantities greater than 100 tonnes to be ‘evaluated’, and certain substances of high concern (for example carcinogenic, mutagenic and toxic to reproduction - CMR’s) to be ‘authorised’.

The EC adopted its proposal for a new scheme to manage the manufacture, importation and supply of chemicals in Europe on in October 2003. This proposal eventually became law once the European Parliament officially approved its final text of REACH. It came into force on 1 June 2007.&lt;ref name="TEPPFA, The European Plastic Pipes and Fittings Association"&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.teppfa.eu/reach/|title = REACh|date = |accessdate = |website = |publisher = |last = TEPPFA, The European Plastic Pipes and Fittings Association|first = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Requirements==
One of the major elements of the REACH [[regulation]] is the requirement to communicate information on [[Chemical substance|chemicals]] up and down the [[supply chain]]. This ensures that manufacturers, importers, and also their customers are aware of information relating to [[health]] and [[safety]] of the products supplied. For many [[retail]]ers the obligation to provide information about [[Chemical substance|substance]]s in their products within 45 days of receipt of a request from a [[consumer]] is particularly challenging. Having detailed information on the substances present in their products will allow retailers to work with the manufacturing base to substitute or remove potentially harmful substances from products. The list of harmful substances is continuously growing and requires [[organization]]s to constantly monitor any announcements and additions to the REACH scope. This can be done on the [[European Chemicals Agency]]'s website.

===Registration===
A requirement is to collect, collate and submit data to the European Chemicals Agency (ECHA) on the hazardous properties of all substances (except Polymers and non-isolated intermediates) manufactured or imported into the EU in quantities above 1 tonne per year. Certain substances of high concern, such as carcinogenic, mutagenic and reproductive toxic substances (CMRs) will have to be authorised.

Chemicals will be registered in three phases according to the tonnage of the substance evaluation:

More than 1000 tonnes a year, or substances of highest concern, must be registered in the first 3 years;

100-1000 tonnes a year must be registered in the first 6 years;

1-100 tonnes a year must be registered in the first 11 years.

In addition, industry should prepare risk assessments and provide controls measures for using the substance safely to downstream users.&lt;ref name="TEPPFA, The European Plastic Pipes and Fittings Association"/&gt;

===Evaluation===
Evaluation provides a means for the authorities to require registrants, and in very limited cases downstream users, to provide further information.

There are two types of evaluation: dossier evaluation and substance :

Dossier evaluation is conducted by authorities to examine proposals for testing to ensure that unnecessary animal tests and costs are avoided, and to check the compliance of registration dossier with the registration requirements.

The relevant authorities perform substance evaluation when there is a reason to suspect that a substance presents a risk to human health or the environment (e.g. because of its structural similarity to another substance). Therefore, all registration dossiers submitted for a substance are examined together and any other available information is taken into account.&lt;ref name="TEPPFA, The European Plastic Pipes and Fittings Association"/&gt;

===Authorisation===
{{main|REACH authorisation procedure}}
The REACH proposal sets up a system under which the use of substances with properties of very high concern and their placing on the market can be made subject to an authorisation requirement.

This authorisation requirement ensures that risks from the use of such substances are either adequately controlled or justified by socio-economic grounds, having taken into account the available information on alternative substances or processes.

The Regulation enables restrictions of use to be introduced across the European Community where this is shown to be necessary. Member States or the Commission may prepare such proposals.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.teppfa.eu/reach/|title = REACh|date = |accessdate = |website = www.teppfa.eu}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Information exchange===
[[File:REACh Dates.png|{{largethumb}}|REACh Key Dates]]

Manufactures and/or importers should develop risk reduction measures for all known uses of the chemical including downstream uses. Downstream users such as plastic pipe producers should provide detail of their uses to their suppliers. In cases where downstream users decide not to disclose this information, they need to have their own CSR.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.teppfa.eu/reach/|title = REACh|date = |accessdate = |website = |publisher = |last = TEPPFA, The Plastic Pipes and Fittings Association|first = }}&lt;/ref&gt;


==History==
REACH is the product of a wide-ranging overhaul of EU chemical policy.  It passed the first reading in the [[European Parliament]] on 17 November 2005, and the [[Council of the European Union|Council of Ministers]] reached a political agreement for a common position on 13 December 2005. The European Parliament approved REACH on 13 December 2006 and the Council of Ministers formally adopted it on 18 December 2006. Weighing up expenditure versus profit has always been a significant issue, with the estimated cost of compliance being around €5&amp;nbsp;billion over 11&amp;nbsp;years, and the assumed health benefits of saved billions of euro in healthcare costs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title=EU backs landmark chemicals law | date=13 December 2005 | publisher=BBC News | url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/4524772.stm}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, there have been different studies on the estimated cost which vary considerably in the outcome. It came into force on 20 January 2009, and will be fully implemented by 2015.

A separate regulation – the [[CLP Regulation]] (for "Classification, Labelling, Packaging") – implements the United Nations [[Globally Harmonized System of Classification and Labelling of Chemicals]] (GHS) and will steadily replace the previous [[Dangerous Substances Directive (67/548/EEC)|Dangerous Substances Directive]] and [[Dangerous Preparations Directive]].

The REACH regulation was amended in April 2018 to include specific information requirements for [[nanomaterials]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://euon.echa.europa.eu/view-article/-/journal_content/title/improved-clarity-on-nanomaterials-in-the-eu-member-states-vote-to-amend-reach-annex-1|title=Improved clarity on nanomaterials in the EU - Member States vote to amend REACH Annexes|last=|first=|date=|publisher=The European Union Observatory for Nanomaterials (EUON)|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|accessdate=2018-10-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Rationale==
The legislation was proposed under dual reasoning: protection of [[health|human health]] and protection of [[natural environment|the environment]].

Using potentially [[toxic substances]] (such as [[phthalate]]s or [[brominated flame retardant]]s) is deemed undesirable and REACH will force the use of certain substances to be phased out. Using potentially toxic substances in products other than those [[ingest]]ed by humans (such as [[electronic device]]s) may seem to be safe, but there are several ways in which chemicals can enter the human body and the environment. Substances can leave particles during [[consumer]] use, for example into the air where they can be inhaled or ingested. Even where they might not do direct harm to humans, they can contaminate the air or water, and can enter the food chain through plants, fish or other animals. According to the European Commission, little safety information exists for 99 percent of the tens of thousands of chemicals placed on the market before 1981.&lt;ref name="US affected"/&gt; There were 100,106 chemicals in use in the EU in 1981, when the last survey was performed. Of these only 3,000 have been tested and over 800 are known to be carcinogenic, mutagenic or toxic to reproduction. These are listed in the Annex 1 of the [[Dangerous Substances Directive (67/548/EEC)|Dangerous Substances Directive]] (now Annex VI of the [[CLP Regulation]]).

Continued use of many toxic chemicals is sometimes justified because "at very low levels they are not a concern to health".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title=Pesticides 'in a third of foods' | date=27 September 2006 | publisher=BBC News | url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/health/5384138.stm}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, many of these substances may [[bioaccumulation|bioaccumulate]] in the human body, thus reaching dangerous concentrations. They may also [[chemical reaction|chemically react]] with one another,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title=Food chemicals 'may harm humans' | date=21 September 2006 | publisher=BBC News | url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/5366028.stm}}&lt;/ref&gt; producing new substances with new risks.

==In non-EU countries==
A number of countries outside of the European Union have started to implement REACH-regulations or are in the process of adopting such a regulatory framework to approach a more globalized system of chemicals registration under the [[Globally Harmonized System of Classification and Labelling of Chemicals]] (GHS).&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.is/20130708194823/http://www.icis.com/Articles/2010/05/31/9362538/reach-like+regulations+enacted+globally.html ICIS.com REACH-like regulations enacted globally] retrieved July 8, 2013&lt;/ref&gt;
Balkan countries such as [[Croatia]] and [[Serbia]] are in the process of adopting the EU REACH system under the auspices of the EU IPA programme. [[Switzerland]] has moved towards implementation of REACH through partial revision of the Swiss Chemical Ordinance on February 1, 2009.  The new Chemicals Management Regulation in [[Turkey]] is paving the way for the planned adoption of REACH in 2013. [[China]] has moved towards a more efficient and coherent system for the control of chemicals in compliance with GHS.

==Controversy==
Apart from the potential costs to [[industry]] and the complexity of the new law, REACH has also attracted concern because of [[animal testing]]. Animal tests on [[vertebrate]]s are now required but allowed only once per each new substance and if suitable alternatives cannot be used.  If a company pays for such tests, it must sell the rights of the results for a "reasonable" price, which is not defined.  There are additional concerns that access to the necessary information may prove very costly for potential registrants needing to purchase it.

An opinion in ''[[Nature (journal)|Nature]]'' in 2009 by Thomas Hartung and Constanza Rovida estimated that 54 million vertebrate animals would be used under REACH and that the costs would amount to €9.5 billion.&lt;ref&gt;T. Hartung &amp; C. Rovida: Chemical regulators have overreached. Opinion in Nature, vol. 460, 27 August 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;  Hartung is the former head of European Centre for the Validation of Alternative Methods (ECVAM).{{citation needed|date=April 2012}} In a news release, ECHA criticised assumptions made by Hartung and Rovida; ECHA's alternative assumptions reduced sixfold the number of animals.&lt;ref&gt;ECHA - [http://echa.europa.eu/doc/press/pr_09_11_animal_testing_20090828.pdf New study inaccurate on the number of test animals for REACH] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100215231108/http://echa.europa.eu/doc/press/pr_09_11_animal_testing_20090828.pdf |date=2010-02-15 }}. Helsinki, 28 August 2009&lt;/ref&gt;{{citation needed|date=April 2012}}

On 8 June 2006, the REACH proposal was criticized by non-EU countries, including the United States, India and [[Brazil]], which stated that the bill would hamper global trade.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | first=Mark | last=Beunderman | title=EU chemicals bill under fire from US-led coalition | date=June 9, 2006 | publisher=EUobserver.com | url=http://euobserver.com/9/21813 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Only representative services==
Non-EU consultancies offer "only representative" services, though according to REACH it is not possible to register a substance if your "only representative" consultancy company is not based in the EU, unless it is subcontracted to an EU-based registrant.

Only representatives are EU based entities that must comply with REACH (Article 8) and should operate standard, transparent working practices. The Only Representative assumes responsibility and [[Legal liability|liability]] for fulfilling obligiations of importers in accordance with REACH for substances being brought into the EU by a non-EU manufacturer.

The SIEFs will bring new challenges. An article in the business news service [[Chemical Watch]] described how some "pre-registrants" may simply be consultants hoping for work ("gold diggers") while others may be aiming to charge exorbitant rates for the data they have to offer ("jackals").&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

==Authorisation List==
The [[European Chemical Agency]] (ECHA) has published the REACH Authorisation List,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://echa.europa.eu/addressing-chemicals-of-concern/authorisation/recommendation-for-inclusion-in-the-authorisation-list/authorisation-list|title=Page has moved - ECHA|website=echa.europa.eu}}&lt;/ref&gt; in an effort to tighten the use of [[substance of very high concern|Substances of Very High Concern]] (SVHCs). The list is an official recommendation from the ECHA to the [[European Commission]]. The list is also regularly updated and expanded. Currently the Candidate List for Authorisation comprises a total of 173 SVHCs, some of which are already active on the Authorization List.

To sell or use these substances, manufacturers, importers, and retailers in the [[European Union]] (EU) must apply for authorization from the [[European Chemical Agency|ECHA]]. The applicant is to submit a chemical safety report on the risks entailed by the substance, as well as an analysis of possible alternative substances or technologies including present and future [[research and development]] processed.

'''Relative pitch''' is the ability of a person to identify or re-create a given [[musical note]] by comparing it to a reference note and identifying the interval between those two notes. Relative pitch implies some or all of the following abilities:
* Determine the distance of a musical note from a set point of reference, e.g. "three [[octave]]s above [[middle C]]"
* Identify the intervals between given tones, regardless of their relation to [[concert pitch]] (A = 440&amp;nbsp;Hz)
* the skill used by singers to correctly sing a melody, following [[musical notation]], by pitching each note in the melody according to its distance from the previous note.  Alternatively, the same skill which allows someone to hear a melody for the first time and name the notes relative to some known [[Ear training#Functional pitch recognition|reference pitch]].

This last definition, which applies not only to singers but also to players of instruments who rely on their own skill to determine the precise pitch of the notes played (wind instruments, fretless string instruments like violin or viola, etc.), is an essential skill for musicians in order to play successfully with others. As an example, think of the different [[concert pitch]]es used by orchestras playing music from different styles (a baroque orchestra using [[Historically informed performance|period instruments]] might decide to use a higher-tuned pitch).

Unlike [[absolute pitch]] (sometimes called "perfect pitch"), relative pitch is quite common among musicians, especially musicians who are used to "playing by ear", and a precise relative pitch is a constant characteristic among good musicians. Unlike perfect pitch, relative pitch can be developed through [[ear training]].&lt;ref&gt;Humphries, Lee. [http://www.thinkingapplied.com/sight-singing_folder/sight-singing.pdf ''Learning to Sight-Sing: The Mental Mechanics of Aural Imagery.''] Minneapolis: Thinking Applied, 2008, No. 1.&lt;/ref&gt; Computer-aided ear training is becoming a popular tool for musicians and music students, and various software is available for improving relative pitch.{{Citation needed|date=August 2018}}

Some music teachers teach their students relative pitch by having them associate each possible interval with the first two notes of a popular song. (See [[ear training]].) Another method of developing relative pitch is playing melodies by ear on a musical instrument, especially one which, unlike a piano or other fingered instrument, requires a specific manual adjustment for each particular tone.  Indian musicians learn relative pitch by singing intervals over a [[drone (music)|drone]], which is also described by [[W. A. Mathieu]]{{Full citation needed|date=August 2018}} using Western [[just intonation]] terminology. Many Western ear training classes use [[solfège]] to teach students relative pitch, while others use [[numerical sight-singing]].

Compound intervals (intervals greater than an octave) can be more difficult to detect than simple intervals (intervals less than an octave).{{Citation needed|date=August 2018}}

Interval recognition is used to identify chords, and can be applied to accurately tune an instrument with respect to a given reference tone, even if the tone is not in [[concert pitch]].{{Citation needed|date=August 2018}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="14280">'''Renewable fuels''' are [[fuel]]s produced from renewable resources.  Examples include: [[biofuels]] (e.g. [[Vegetable oil used as fuel]], [[ethanol]], [[methanol fuel|methanol]] from [[Carbon Recycling International|clean energy and carbon dioxide]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; or biomass, and biodiesel) and [[Hydrogen fuel]] (when produced with renewable processes).  This is in contrast to [[non-renewable resource|non-renewable]] fuels such as [[natural gas]], [[Liquified petroleum gas|LPG]] ([[propane]]), [[petroleum]] and other [[fossil fuels]] and [[nuclear power|nuclear energy]].  Renewable fuels can include fuels that are synthesized from [[renewable energy]] sources, such as wind and solar.  Renewable fuels have gained in popularity due to their [[sustainability]], [[Carbon neutral|low contributions]] to the [[carbon cycle]], and in some cases lower amounts of [[greenhouse gas]]es.  The geo-political ramifications of these fuels are also of interest, particularly to industrialized economies which desire [[Oil dependency|independence]] from [[Middle Eastern]] oil.

==Rationale for renewable fuels==
The [[International Energy Agency]]'s ''World Energy Outlook 2006'' concludes that rising oil demand, if left unchecked,
would accentuate the consuming countries' vulnerability to a severe supply disruption and resulting price shock. Renewable biofuels for transport represent a key source of diversification from [[petroleum products]]. Biofuels from grain and beet in [[temperate region]]s have a part to play, but they are relatively expensive and their energy efficiency and CO2 savings benefits, are variable. Biofuels from sugar cane and other highly productive tropical crops are much more competitive and beneficial. But all first generation biofuels ultimately compete with food production for land, water, and other resources. Greater efforts are required to develop and commercialize second generation biofuel technologies, such as biorefineries and [[cellulosic ethanol|ligno-cellulosics]], enabling the flexible production of biofuels and other products from non-edible plant materials.&lt;ref name=IEA&gt;[http://www.iea.org/textbase/papers/2007/so_contribution.pdf Contribution of Renewables to Energy Security]&lt;/ref&gt;

Hubbert's [[Hubbert peak theory|peak oil theory]] suggests that petroleum is a [[finite resource]] that is rapidly depleting. Of the worldwide total remaining petroleum reserves of approximately {{convert|1277702000000|oilbbl|km3}} (about one half of the original virgin reserves) and a worldwide usage rate of {{convert|25000000000|oilbbl|km3}} per year, only about 50 years worth of [[petroleum]] is predicted to remain at the current depletion rate. Petroleum is imperative for the following industries: [[fuel]] (home heating, jet fuel, gasoline, diesel, etc.) [[transportation]], [[agriculture]], [[pharmaceutical industry|pharmaceutical]], [[plastics]]/resins, man-made fibers, [[synthetic rubber]], and [[explosives]]. If the modern world remains reliant on petroleum as a source of energy, the price of crude oil could increase markedly, destabilizing economies worldwide. Consequently, renewable fuel drivers include: high oil prices, imbalance of trade, instability in oil exporting regions of the world, the [[Energy Policy Act of 2005]], the potential for windfall profits for American farmers and industries, avoidance of economic depression, avoidance of scarcity of products due to a volatile ‘[[peak oil]]’ scenario expected to begin as early as 2021,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.news.cornell.edu/stories/July05/ethanol.toocostly.ssl.html Biomass for biofuel isn't worth it&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; (though peak oil is not a new idea) and a slowing of [[global warming]] that may usher in unprecedented [[climate change]].

Furthermore, the global debate on [[climate change]], along with regional geopolitical instabilities have challenged nations to act to develop both alternative and [[carbon-neutral fuel|carbon-neutral]] sources of energy. Renewable fuels are therefore becoming attractive to many governments, who are beginning to see sustainable energy independence as a valuable asset.

On December 19, 2007, President Bush signed into law the [[Energy Independence and Security Act]], establishing a requirement that at least {{convert|36|e9USgal|m3}} of renewable fuel be used in the marketplace by 2022.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nacsonline.com/NACS/Government/MotorFuels/Pages/RenewableFuels.aspx Issue Update: Renewable Fuels Retailer Liability]&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the International Energy Agency (IEA), [[cellulosic ethanol commercialization]] could allow [[ethanol fuel]]s to play a much larger role in the future than previously thought.&lt;ref&gt;International Energy Agency (2006). [http://www.worldenergyoutlook.org/summaries2006/English.pdf ''World Energy Outlook 2006''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070928041451/http://www.worldenergyoutlook.org/summaries2006/English.pdf |date=2007-09-28 }} p. 8.&lt;/ref&gt; Cellulosic ethanol can be made from plant matter composed primarily of inedible cellulose fibers that form the stems and branches of most plants. Dedicated [[energy crop]]s, such as switchgrass, are also promising cellulose sources that can be produced in many regions of the United States.&lt;ref&gt;Biotechnology Industry Organization (2007).

Biofuel is a type of fuel whose energy is derived from biological [[carbon fixation]]. Biofuels include fuels derived from [[biomass]] conversion, as well as  [[Biofuel#Solid biofuels|solid biomass]], [[liquid fuels]] and various [[biogas]]es.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| doi = 10.1016/j.apenergy.2009.04.036| title = Political, economic and environmental impacts of biofuels: A review| year = 2009| last1 = Demirbas | first1 = A. .| journal = Applied Energy| volume = 86| pages = S108–S117 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Although [[fossil fuel]]s have their origin in ancient [[carbon fixation]], they are not considered biofuels by the generally accepted definition because they contain carbon that has been "out" of the carbon cycle for a very long time. Biofuels are gaining increased public and scientific attention, driven by factors such as [[Oil price increases since 2003|oil price spikes]], the need for increased [[energy security]], concern over [[greenhouse gas]] emissions from [[fossil fuel]]s, and support from [[Ethanol fuel in the United_States#Tax_credits|government subsidies]].

[[Bioethanol]] is an [[alcohol]] made by [[Ethanol fermentation|fermentation]], mostly from [[carbohydrate]]s produced in [[sugar]] or [[starch]] crops such as [[Maize|corn]] or [[sugar cane]].  [[cellulose|Cellulosic biomass]], derived from non-food sources such as trees and grasses, is also being developed as a [[feedstock]] for ethanol production. Ethanol can be used as a fuel for vehicles in its pure form, but it is usually used as a [[gasoline]] [[Fuel additive|additive]] to increase octane and improve vehicle emissions. Bioethanol is widely used in the [[biofuel in the united states|USA]] and in [[Ethanol fuel in Brazil|Brazil]]. Current plant design does not provide for converting the [[lignin]] portion of plant raw materials to fuel components by fermentation.

[[Biodiesel]] is made from [[vegetable oil]]s and [[animal fat]]s. Biodiesel can be used as a fuel for vehicles in its pure form, but it is usually used as a [[diesel fuel|diesel]] additive to reduce levels of particulates, [[carbon monoxide]], and [[hydrocarbon]]s from diesel-powered vehicles. Biodiesel is produced from oils or fats using [[transesterification]] and is the most common biofuel in Europe.

In 2010 worldwide biofuel production reached 105 billion liters (28 billion gallons US), up 17% from 2009, and biofuels provided 2.7% of the world's fuels for road transport, a contribution largely made up of ethanol and biodiesel.&lt;ref name=Biofuels2010&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.worldwatch.org/biofuels-make-comeback-despite-tough-economy|title=Biofuels Make a Comeback Despite Tough Economy|publisher=[[Worldwatch Institute]]|date=2011-08-31|accessdate=2011-08-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; Global [[ethanol fuel]] production reached 86 billion liters (23 billion gallons US) in 2010, with the United States and Brazil as the world's top producers, accounting together for 90% of global production. The world's largest biodiesel producer is the [[European Union]], accounting for 53% of all biodiesel production in 2010.&lt;ref name=Biofuels2010/&gt; As of 2011, mandates for blending biofuels exist in 31 countries at the national level and in 29 states/provinces.&lt;ref name=ren212011&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ren21.net/Portals/97/documents/GSR/GSR2011_Master18.pdf |title=Renewables 2011: Global Status Report |author=[[REN21]] |year=2011 |pages=13–14 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  According to the [[International Energy Agency]], biofuels have the potential to meet more than a quarter of world demand for transportation fuels by 2050.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.platts.com/RSSFeedDetailedNews/RSSFeed/Oil/6017103 |title=IEA says biofuels can displace 27% of transportation fuels by 2050 Washington |author= |date=20 April 2011 |work=Platts }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Pyrolysis oil]] is another type of fuel derived from the [[Lignocellulosic biomass|lignocellulosic]] fraction of biomass. By rapidly heating biomass in the absence of oxygen ([[pyrolysis]]), a liquid crude can be formed that can be further processed into a usable bio-oil. As opposed to other biofuels, pyrolysis oils use the non-edible fraction of biomass and can occur on the order of milliseconds and without the need for large fermentation reactors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Huber|first=George|title=Breaking the Chemical and Engineering Barriers to Lignocellulosic Biofuels: Next Generation Hydrocarbon Biorefineries|year=2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Hydrogen fuel==
[[Image:Photo praxair plant.hydrogen.infrastructure.jpg|thumb|200px|right|Hydrogen fuel requires the development of a specific infrastructure for processing, transport and storage.]]
{{main|Hydrogen economy}}
[[Hydrogen fuel]] refers to the use of [[hydrogen]] gas (H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) as an energy carrier. Broadly speaking, the production of renewable [[hydrogen fuel]] can be divided into two general categories: biologically derived production, and chemical production.&lt;ref name="nrelH2production"&gt;National Renewable Energy Laboratory 2003 ''Research Review'': "[http://www.nrel.gov/hydrogen/pdfs/49923.pdf New Horizons for Hydrogen] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304192032/http://www.nrel.gov/hydrogen/pdfs/49923.pdf |date=2016-03-04 }}."&lt;/ref&gt; This is an area of current research, and new developments and technologies are causing this field to evolve rapidly.

The biological production of hydrogen fuel has been a topic of research since at least the 1970s. Hydrogen gas can be produced from biomass sources like agricultural and forest residues, consumer waste and other specific agricultural crops.&lt;ref name="nrelH2production" /&gt; Specifically, hydrogen fuel is produced by a process called [[gasification]], where biomass is processed into a combustible gas and then burned, or by [[pyrolysis]], a related process which can lead to hydrogen gas suitable for fuel-cell applications. One continuing subject of research regards the production of unwanted co-products in both of these processes. The presence of other contaminant gases often depend on specific composition of the biomass source, which can be difficult to control.&lt;ref name="nrelH2production" /&gt; Another source for biological production of hydrogen fuel is [[algae]]. In the late 1990s it was discovered that if algae are deprived of sulfur they will switch from the production of oxygen, as in normal photosynthesis, to the production of hydrogen.&lt;ref name="wiredSwamp"&gt;Wired, ''[https://www.wired.com/wired/archive/10.04/mustread.html?pg=5 It Came from the Swamp: Reengineering Algae To Fuel The Hydrogen Economy],'' accessed September 17, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; Experimental [[Biological hydrogen production (Algae)|algae farms]] are attempting to make algae an economically feasible energy source.&lt;ref name="registerAlgae"&gt;The Register, ''[https://www.theregister.co.uk/2006/02/24/pond_scum_breakthrough/ Pond life: the future of energy],'' accessed September 17, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

There are also several physico-chemical methods for producing hydrogen; most of these methods require electrolysis of water. When this process draws its power from renewable energy sources like [[wind turbines]] or [[photovoltaic cells]], the production requires little consumption of non-renewable resources. Hydrogen fuel, when produced by renewable sources of energy like wind or solar power, is a renewable fuel.&lt;ref name="nrelH2production" /&gt;

==Processed engineered fuel==
PEF is a partial replacement for fossil fuels in cement kilns. It has significant calorific value and can be used as a fuel substitute for coal and gas in high-combustion facilities. PEF facilities typically divert waste from landfill, reducing demand for non-renewable coal and reducing waste to landfill.

This is an excerpt from the original script of ''[[Natural Born Killers]]'' by [[Quentin Tarantino]].]] --&gt;
'''Screenwriting''', also called '''scriptwriting''', is the art and craft of writing [[Screenplay|scripts]] for [[mass media]] such as [[feature film]]s, [[television production]]s or [[video game]]s. It is often a [[freelance]] profession.

[[Screenwriter]]s are responsible for researching the story, developing the narrative, writing the script, screenplay, dialogues and delivering it, in the required format, to development executives. Screenwriters therefore have great influence over the creative direction and emotional impact of the screenplay and, arguably, of the finished film. Screenwriters either pitch original ideas to producers, in the hope that they will be optioned or sold; or are commissioned by a producer to create a screenplay from a concept, true story, existing screen work or literary work, such as a novel, poem, play, comic book, or short story.

==Types==
The act of screenwriting takes many forms across the entertainment industry. Often, multiple writers work on the same script at different stages of [[Script development|development]] with different tasks. Over the course of a successful career, a screenwriter might be hired to write in a wide variety of roles.

Some of the most common forms of screenwriting jobs include:

===Spec script writing===
[[Spec script]]s are feature film or [[Television program|television show]] scripts written on speculation of sale, without the commission of a [[film studio]], [[production company]] or TV network. The content is usually invented solely by the screenwriter, though spec screenplays can also be based on established works or real people and events. The spec script is a Hollywood sales tool. The vast majority of scripts written each year are spec scripts, but only a small percentage make it to the screen.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.seattlepi.com/movies/267279_screenplay07.html The Great American Screenplay now fuels wannabe authors&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] from seattlepi.nwsource.com&lt;/ref&gt; A spec script is usually a wholly original work, but can also be an [[Film adaptation|adaptation]].

In television writing, a spec script is a sample teleplay written to demonstrate the writer's knowledge of a show and ability to imitate its style and conventions. It is submitted to the show's producers in hopes of being hired to write future episodes of the show. Budding screenwriters attempting to break into the business generally begin by writing one or more spec scripts.

Although writing spec scripts is part of any writer's career, the [[Writers Guild of America]] forbids members to write "on speculation". The distinction is that a "spec script" is written as a sample by the writer on his or her own; what is forbidden is writing a script for a specific producer without a contract. In addition to writing a script on speculation, it is generally not advised to write camera angles or other directional terminology, as these are likely to be ignored. A director may write up a shooting script himself or herself, a script that guides the team in what to do in order to carry out the director's vision of how the script should look. The director may ask the original writer to co-write it with him or her, or to rewrite a script that satisfies both the director and producer of the film/TV show.

Spec writing is also unique in that the writer must pitch the idea to producers. In order to sell the script, it must have a killer title, good writing, and a great logline. A logline is one sentence that lays out what the movie is about. A well written logline will convey the tone of the film, introduce the main character, and touch on the primary conflict. Usually the logline and title work in tandem to draw people in, and it is highly suggested to incorporate irony into them when possible. These things, along with nice, clean writing will hugely impact whether or not a producer picks up the spec script.

=== Commissioned screenplay ===
A commissioned screenplay is written by a hired writer. The concept is usually developed long before the screenwriter is brought on, and often has multiple writers work on it before the script is given a [[Green-light|green light]].

===Feature assignment writing===
Scripts written on assignment are screenplays created under contract with a [[Movie studio|studio]], production company, or producer. These are the most common assignments sought after in screenwriting. A screenwriter can get an assignment either exclusively or from "open" assignments. A screenwriter can also be approached and offered an assignment. Assignment scripts are generally adaptations of an existing idea or property owned by the hiring company,&lt;ref&gt;Lydia Willen and Joan Willen, ''How to Sell your Screenplay'', pg 242. Square One Publishers, 2001.&lt;/ref&gt; but can also be original works based on a concept created by the writer or producer.

===Rewriting and script doctoring===
Most produced films are rewritten to some extent during the development process. Frequently, they are not rewritten by the original writer of the script.&lt;ref&gt;Skip Press, ''The Ultimate Writer's Guide to Hollywood'', pg xiii. Barnes and Noble Books, 2004.&lt;/ref&gt; Many established screenwriters, as well as new writers whose work shows promise but lacks marketability, make their living rewriting scripts.

When a script's central premise or characters are good but the script is otherwise unusable, a different writer or team of writers is contracted to do an entirely new draft, often referred to as a "page one rewrite". {{anchor|polish}}When only small problems remain, such as bad dialogue or poor humor, a writer is hired to do a "polish" or "punch-up".

Depending on the size of the new writer's contributions, [[screen credit]] may or may not be given. For instance, in the American film industry, credit to rewriters is given only if 50% or more of the script is substantially changed.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wga.org/subpage_writersresources.aspx?id=171-screen credits policy&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} from wga.org&lt;/ref&gt; These standards can make it difficult to establish the identity and number of screenwriters who contributed to a film's creation.

When established writers are called in to rewrite portions of a script late in the development process, they are commonly referred to as [[script doctor]]s. Prominent script doctors include Christopher Keane, [[Steve Zaillian]], [[William Goldman]], [[Robert Towne]], [[Mort Nathan]], Quentin Tarantino and Peter Russell.&lt;ref&gt;Virginia Wright Wetman. "Success Has 1,000 Fathers (So Do Films)". ''[[The New York Times]]''. May 28, 1995. Arts section, p.16.&lt;/ref&gt; Many up-and-coming screenwriters work as ghost writers.{{citation needed|date=July 2017}}

===Television writing===
A freelance television writer typically uses spec scripts or previous credits and reputation to obtain a contract to write one or more episodes for an existing television show. After an episode is submitted, rewriting or polishing may be required.

A staff writer for a TV show generally works in-house, writing and rewriting episodes. Staff writers&amp;mdash;often given other titles, such as [[story editor]] or [[Television producer|producer]]&amp;mdash;work both as a group and individually on episode scripts to maintain the show's tone, style, characters, and plots.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tvwriter.com/faq/faq.htm TV Writer.com&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070929034952/http://www.tvwriter.com/faq/faq.htm |date=2007-09-29 }} from tvwriter.com&lt;/ref&gt;

Television show creators write the [[television pilot]] and [[Bible (screenwriting)|bible]] of new television series. They are responsible for creating and managing all aspects of a show's characters, style, and plots. Frequently, a creator remains responsible for the show's day-to-day creative decisions throughout the series run as [[showrunner]], [[head writer]] or story editor.

====Writing for daily series====
The process of writing for [[soap opera]]s and [[telenovela]]s is different from that used by [[prime time]] shows, due in part to the need to produce new episodes five days a week for several months. In one example cited by [[Jane Espenson]], screenwriting is a "sort of three-tiered system":&lt;ref name="jane"&gt;[http://www.janeespenson.com/archives/00000588.php 08/13/2008: Soapy Scenes], from "Jane in Progress" a blog for aspiring screenwriters by Jane Espenson&lt;/ref&gt;
:a few top writers craft the overall [[story arc]]s. Mid-level writers work with them to turn those arcs into things that look a lot like traditional episode outlines, and an array of writers below that (who do not even have to be local to Los Angeles), take those outlines and quickly generate the dialogue while adhering slavishly to the outlines.

Espenson notes that a recent trend has been to eliminate the role of the mid-level writer, relying on the senior writers to do rough outlines and giving the other writers a bit more freedom. Regardless, when the finished scripts are sent to the top writers, the latter do a final round of rewrites. Espenson also notes that a show that airs daily, with characters who have decades of history behind their voices, necessitates a writing staff without the distinctive voice that can sometimes be present in prime-time series.&lt;ref name="jane"/&gt;

====Writing for game shows====

Game shows feature live contestants, but still use a team of writers as part of a specific format.&lt;ref name="WGA"&gt;[http://www.wga.org/content/default.aspx?id=2630 05/15/2010: Writers Guild of America, Reality &amp; Game Show Writers]&lt;/ref&gt; This may involve the slate of questions and even specific phrasing or dialogue on the part of the host. Writers may not script the dialogue used by the contestants, but they work with the producers to create the actions, scenarios, and sequence of events that support the game show's concept.

===Video game writing===

With the continued development and increased complexity of video games, many opportunities are available to employ screenwriters in the field of [[video game design]]. Video game writers work closely with the other game designers to create characters, scenarios, and dialogue.&lt;ref&gt;Skip Press, ''The Ultimate Writer's Guide to Hollywood'', pg207. Barnes and Noble Books, 2004.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Theories on writing a screenplay==
{{Literature}}
Fundamentally, the screenplay is a unique literary form. It is like a musical score, in that it is intended to be interpreted on the basis of other artists' performance, rather than serving as a finished product for the enjoyment of its audience. For this reason, a screenplay is written using technical jargon and tight, spare prose when describing stage directions. Unlike a [[novel]] or [[short story]], a screenplay focuses on describing the literal, visual aspects of the story, rather than on the internal thoughts of its characters. In screenwriting, the aim is to evoke those thoughts and emotions through subtext, action, and [[Symbolism (arts)|symbolism]].&lt;ref&gt;Trottier, David: "The Screenwriter's Bible", pg4. Silman James, 1998.&lt;/ref&gt;

Several main screenwriting theories help writers approach the screenplay by systematizing the structure, goals and techniques of writing a script. The most common kinds of theories are structural. Screenwriter William Goldman is widely quoted as saying "Screenplays are structure".

===Three-act structure===
{{Main article|Three-act structure}}
The three acts are setup (of the location and characters), confrontation (with an obstacle), and resolution (culminating in a climax and a dénouement). Usually, in a two-hour film, the first and third acts both typically last around 30 minutes, with the middle act lasting roughly an hour, but today many films start from the confrontation point and then goes to the setup act or they might even start at the last act and then go back to the start.

In ''[[Writing Drama]]'', French writer and director [[Yves Lavandier]] shows a slightly different approach.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.clown-enfant.com/leclown/eng/drama/livre.htm#1STRUC Excerpt on the three-act structure] from Yves Lavandier's ''Writing Drama''&lt;/ref&gt; As do most theorists, he maintains that every human action, whether fictitious or real, contains three logical parts: before the action, during the action, and after the action. But since the climax is part of the action, Yves Lavandier maintains that the second act must include the climax, which makes for a much shorter third act than is found in most screenwriting theories.

Besides the three-act structure, it is also common to use a four- or five-act structure in a screenplay, though certain screenplays may include as many as twenty separate acts.

=== The Hero's Journey ===
The hero's journey, also referred to as the [[monomyth]], is an idea formulated by noted mythologist [[Joseph Campbell]]. The central concept of the monomyth is that a pattern can be seen in stories and myths across history. Campbell defined and explained that pattern in his book ''[[The Hero with a Thousand Faces]]'' (1949).

Campbell's insight was that important myths from around the world, which have survived for thousands of years, all share a fundamental structure. This fundamental structure contains a number of stages, which include
#'''a call to adventure''', which the hero has to accept or decline,
#'''a road of trials''', on which the hero succeeds or fails,
#'''achieving the goal (or "boon")''', which often results in important self-knowledge,
#'''a return to the ordinary world''', which again the hero can succeed or fail, and
#'''application of the boon,''' in which what the hero has gained can be used to improve the world.

Later, screenwriter [[Christopher Vogler]] refined and expanded the hero's journey for the screenplay form in his book, ''[[The Writer's Journey: Mythic Structure for Writers]]'' (1993).

=== Syd Field's Paradigm ===
In his book ''Screenplay'' [[Syd Field]] posited a new theory, which he called the Paradigm. Field noticed that in a 120-page screenplay, Act Two was notoriously boring, and was also twice the length of Acts One and Three. He also noticed that an important dramatic event usually occurred at the middle of the picture, which implied to him that the middle act was actually two acts in one. So the Three Act Structure is notated 1, 2a, 2b, 3, resulting in [[Aristotle]]'s Three Acts divided into four pieces.

Field also introduced the idea of [[plot point|Plot Points]] into screenwriting theory. Plot Points are important structural functions that happen in approximately the same place in most successful movies, like the verses and choruses in a popular song. In subsequent books, Field has added to his original list, and students of his like Viki King and Linda Seger have added to the list of Plot Points. Here is a current list of the major Plot Points that are congruent with Field's Paradigm:

'''Opening Image''': The first image in the screenplay should summarize the entire film, especially its tone. Often, writers go back and redo this as the last thing before submitting the script.

'''Exposition''': Provides some background information to the audience about the plot, characters' histories, setting, and theme.

'''[[Inciting Incident]]''': Also called the catalyst, this is the point in the story when the Protagonist encounters the problem that will change their life. This is when the detective is assigned the case, where Boy meets Girl, and where the Comic Hero gets fired from his cushy job, forcing him into comic circumstances.

'''Plot Point 1''': The last scene in Act One, Plot Point 1 is a surprising development that radically changes the Protagonist's life, and forces him to confront the Opponent. In ''[[Star Wars (film)|Star Wars]]'', this is when [[Luke Skywalker|Luke]]'s family is killed by the [[Galactic Empire (Star Wars)|Empire]]. He has no home to go back to, so he joins the [[Rebel Alliance|Rebels]] in opposing [[Darth Vader]].

'''Pinch 1''': A reminder scene at about 3/8 the way through the script (halfway through Act 2a) that brings up the central conflict of the drama, reminding us of the overall conflict. For example, in ''Star Wars'', Pinch 1 is the [[Imperial stormtrooper|Stormtroopers]] attacking the [[Millennium Falcon]] in [[Mos Eisley]], reminding us the Empire is after the stolen plans to the [[Death Star]] [[R2-D2]] is carrying and Luke and [[Obi-Wan Kenobi|Ben Kenobi]] are trying to get to the Rebel Alliance (the main conflict).

'''Midpoint''': An important scene in the middle of the script, often a reversal of fortune or revelation that changes the direction of the story. Field suggests that driving the story towards the Midpoint keeps the second act from sagging.

'''Pinch 2''': Another reminder scene about 5/8 through the script (halfway through Act 2b) that is somehow linked to Pinch 1 in reminding the audience about the central conflict. In ''Star Wars'', Pinch 2 is the Stormtroopers attacking them as they rescue the [[Princess Leia|Princess]] in the Death Star. Both scenes remind us of the Empire's opposition, and using the Stormtrooper attack [[motif (literature)|motif]] unifies both Pinches.

'''Plot Point 2''': A dramatic reversal that ends Act 2 and begins Act 3, which is about confrontation and resolution. Sometimes Plot Point 2 is the moment when the Hero has had enough and is finally going to face the Opponent. Sometimes, like in ''[[Toy Story]]'', it's the low-point for the Hero, and he must bounce back to overcome the odds in Act 3.

'''Showdown''': About midway through Act 3, the Protagonist will confront the Main Problem of the story and either overcome it, or come to a tragic end.

'''Resolution''': The issues of the story are resolved.

'''Tag''': An epilogue, tying up the loose ends of the story, giving the audience closure. This is also known as [[denouement]]. In general, films in recent decades have had longer denouements than films made in the 1970s or earlier.

===The sequence approach===
The sequence approach to screenwriting, sometimes known as "[[Sequence (filmmaking)|eight-sequence structure]]", is a system developed by [[Frank Daniel]], while he was the head of the Graduate Screenwriting Program at [[University of Southern California|USC]]. It is based in part on the fact that, in the early days of cinema, technical matters forced screenwriters to divide their stories into sequences, each the length of a reel (about ten minutes).&lt;ref&gt;Gulino, Paul Joseph: "Screenwriting: The Sequence Approach", pg3. Continuum, 2003.&lt;/ref&gt;

The sequence approach mimics that early style. The story is broken up into eight 10-15 minute sequences. The sequences serve as "mini-movies", each with their own compressed three-act structure. The first two sequences combine to form the film's first act. The next four create the film's second act. The final two sequences complete the resolution and dénouement of the story. Each sequence's resolution creates the situation which sets up the next sequence.

==Dialogue and description==

===Imagery===
Imagery can be used in many metaphoric ways. In ''[[The Talented Mr. Ripley (film)|The Talented Mr. Ripley]]'', the title character talked of wanting to close the door on himself sometime, and then, in the end, he did. [[Pathetic fallacy]] is also frequently used; rain to express a character feeling depressed, sunny days promote a feeling of happiness and calm. Imagery can be used to sway the emotions of the audience and to clue them in to what is happening.

Imagery is well defined in ''[[City of God (2002 film)|City of God]]''. The opening image sequence sets the tone for the entire film. The film opens with the shimmer of a knife's blade on a sharpening stone. A drink is being prepared, The knife's blade shows again, juxtaposed is a shot of a chicken letting loose of its harness on its feet. All symbolising 'The One that got away'. The film is about life in the favelas in Rio - sprinkled with violence and games and ambition.

===Dialogue===
Dialogue can be very important to the film industry, because there are no written words to explain the characters or plot; it all has to be explained through dialogue and imagery.{{citation needed|date=July 2014}} [[Bollywood]] and other Indian film industries use separate dialogue writers in addition to the [[screenplay writer]]s.{{citation needed|date=July 2014}}

===Plot===
{{See also|Act structure}}
While the story is what will be told (narrative); the plot is how the story will be told (narration). This vocabulary is not indisputable for sometimes in literature stories and plots are used exactly the other way around.

==Screenwriting education==
A number of American universities offer specialized [[Master of Fine Arts]] and undergraduate programs in screenwriting, including [[USC School of Cinematic Arts|USC]], [[DePaul University]], [[AFI Conservatory|American Film Institute]], [[Loyola Marymount University]], [[Chapman University]], [[Tisch School of the Arts|NYU]], [[University of California, Los Angeles|UCLA]],  [[Boston University]] and the [[University of the Arts (Philadelphia)|University of the Arts]]. In Europe, the United Kingdom has an extensive range of MA and BA Screenwriting Courses including [[London College of Communication]], [[Bournemouth University]], [[Edinburgh University]], and [[Goldsmiths, University of London|Goldsmiths College (University of London)]]. 

Some schools offer non-degree screenwriting programs, such as the [[TheFilmSchool]], The International Film and Television School Fast Track, and the UCLA Professional / [http://writers.uclaextension.edu/ Extension Programs in Screenwriting].

[[New York Film Academy]] offers both degree and non-degree educational systems with campuses all around the world.

Many screenwriters choose to pursue screenwriting independently with free online educational resources such as ScreenCraft, Keanewords, NoFilmSchool, Film Daily, [[The Black List]], [[John August]] and Craig Mazin's [[Scriptnotes]] podcast, and Julie Gray's Just Effing Entertain Me.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Gray|first1=Julie|title=Just Effing Entertain Me|date=2013|publisher=Julie Gray|isbn=9781304404831|quote=A comprehensive guide to screenwriting with proven methods to help you test your ideas BEFORE you write your script, outlining tricks that make every page fascinating, chapters on character development, dialogue, theme}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Julie Gray|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/julie-gray/|publisher=Huffington Post|quote=A Hollywood refugee living in the Middle East, Julie Gray has authored two books and is working on a memoir.

== History ==
The first true screenplay is thought to be from [[George Melies]]' 1902 film ''[[A Trip to the Moon]]''. The movie is silent, but the screenplay still contains specific descriptions and action lines that resemble a modern-day script. As time went on and films became longer and more complex, the need for a screenplay became more prominent in the industry. The introduction of movie theaters also impacted the development of screenplays, as audiences became more widespread and sophisticated, so the stories had to be as well. Once the first non-silent movie was released in 1927, screenwriting became a hugely important position within Hollywood. The "studio system" of the 1930s only heightened this importance, as studio heads wanted productivity. Thus, having the "blueprint" (continuity screenplay) of the film beforehand became extremely optimal. Around 1970, the "spec script" was first created, and changed the industry for writers forever. Now, screenwriting for television (teleplays) is considered as difficult and competitive as writing is for feature films.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://screenwritingfacts.weebly.com/history.html|title=History|website=The Art of Screenwriting|access-date=2016-04-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Portrayed in film==
Screenwriting has been the focus of a number of films:

* ''[[Crashing Hollywood (1931 film)|Crashing Hollywood]]'' (1931)&amp;mdash;A screenwriter collaborates on a gangster movie with a real-life gangster. When the film is released, the mob doesn’t like how accurate the movie is.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0030022/ | title=Internet Movie Database listing of Crashing Hollywood}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''[[Sunset Boulevard (1950 film)|Sunset Boulevard]]'' (1950)&amp;mdash;Actor [[William Holden]] portrays a hack screenwriter forced to collaborate on a screenplay with a desperate, fading [[silent film]] star, played by [[Gloria Swanson]].
*''[[In a Lonely Place]]'' (1950)&amp;mdash;[[Humphrey Bogart]] is a washed up screenwriter who gets framed for murder.
* ''[[Paris, When it Sizzles]]'' (1964)&amp;mdash;[[William Holden]] plays a drunk screenwriter who has wasted months partying and has just two days to finish his script. He hires [[Audrey Hepburn]] to help.
* ''[[Barton Fink]]'' (1991)&amp;mdash;[[John Turturro]] plays a naïve New York playwright who comes to Hollywood with high hopes and great ambition. While there, he meets one of his writing idols, a celebrated novelist from the past who has become a drunken hack screenwriter (a character based on [[William Faulkner]]).
* ''[[Mistress (1992 film)|Mistress]]'' (1992)&amp;mdash;In this comedy written by [[Barry Primus]] and [[J. F. Lawton]], [[Robert Wuhl]] is a screenwriter/director who's got integrity, vision, and a serious script - but no career. [[Martin Landau]] is a sleazy producer who introduces Wuhl to [[Robert De Niro]], [[Danny Aiello]] and [[Eli Wallach]] - three guys willing to invest in the movie, but with one catch: each one wants his mistress to be the star.
* ''[[The Player (film)|The Player]]'' (1992)&amp;mdash;In this satire of the Hollywood system, [[Tim Robbins]] plays a movie producer who thinks he’s being blackmailed by a screenwriter whose script was rejected.
* ''[[Adaptation (film)|Adaptation.]]'' (2002)&amp;mdash;[[Nicolas Cage]] portrays real-life screenwriter [[Charlie Kaufman]] (as well as his fictional brother, Donald) as Kaufman struggles to adapt an esoteric book ([[Susan Orlean]]’s real-life nonfiction work ''[[The Orchid Thief]]'' ) into an action-filled Hollywood screenplay.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.chasingthefrog.com/reelfaces/adaptation_intview4.php| title=Interview with Charlie Kaufman| publisher=chasingthefrog.com| deadurl=yes| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070810022733/http://chasingthefrog.com/reelfaces/adaptation_intview4.php| archivedate=2007-08-10| df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''[[Dreams on Spec]]'' (2007)&amp;mdash;The only documentary to follow aspiring screenwriters as they struggle to turn their scripts into movies, the film also features wisdom from established scribes like [[James L. Brooks]], [[Nora Ephron]], [[Carrie Fisher]], and [[Gary Ross]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://articles.latimes.com/2007/jul/18/entertainment/et-scriptland18 | title=Producers, writers face huge chasm: Compensation for digital media and residuals for reuse of content are major issues as contract talks begin |journal=Los Angeles Times |date= July 18, 2007 |author=Jay A. Fernandez}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''[[Seven Psychopaths]]'' (2012)&amp;mdash;In this satire, written and directed by [[Martin McDonagh]], [[Colin Farrell]] plays a screenwriter who is struggling to finish his screenplay ''Seven Psychopaths'', but finds unlikely inspiration after his best friend steals a Shih Tzu owned by a vicious gangster.

==Copyright protection==

===United States===
In the [[United States]], completed works may be [[copyright]]ed, but ideas and plots may not be. Any document written after 1978 in the U.S. is automatically copyrighted even without legal [[Register of Copyrights|registration]] or notice. However, the [[Library of Congress]] will formally register a screenplay. U.S. Courts will not accept a lawsuit alleging that a defendant is infringing on the plaintiff's copyright in a work until the plaintiff registers the plaintiff's claim to those copyrights with the Copyright Office.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/17/411- 17 USC 411 (United States Code, Title 17, Section 411)]&lt;/ref&gt; This means that a plaintiff's attempts to remedy an infringement will be delayed during the registration process.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.copyright.gov/circs/circ01.pdf U.S. Copyright Office Circular 1]&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, in many infringement cases, the plaintiff will not be able recoup [[attorney fees]] or collect [[statutory damages for copyright infringement]], unless the plaintiff registered before the infringement began.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/17/412- 17 USC 412]&lt;/ref&gt; For the purpose of establishing evidence that a screenwriter is the author of a particular screenplay (but not related to the legal copyrighting status of a work), the Writers Guild of America registers screenplays. However, since this service is one of record keeping and is not regulated by law, a variety of commercial and non-profit organizations exist for registering screenplays. Protection for teleplays, formats, as well as screenplays may be registered for instant proof-of-authorship by third-party assurance vendors, such as the [http://www.creatorsvault.com/ Creators Vault].

There is a line of [[precedent]] in several states (including California and New York) that allows for "idea submission" claims, based on the notion that submission of a screenplay (or even a mere pitch for one) to a studio under very particular sets of factual circumstances could potentially give rise to an implied contract to pay for the ideas embedded in that screenplay, even if an alleged derivative work does not actually infringe the screenplay author's copyright.&lt;ref name="Biederman"&gt;{{cite book|title=Law and Business of the Entertainment Industries|date=November 2006|publisher=Greenwood Publishing Group|isbn=9780275992057|pages=313–327|author=Donald E. Biederman|edition=5th|author2=Edward P. Pierson |author3=Martin E. Silfen |author4=Janna Glasser |author5=Charles J. Biederman |author6=Kenneth J. Abdo |author7=Scott D. Sanders }}&lt;/ref&gt; The unfortunate [[side effect]] of such precedents (which were supposed to protect screenwriters) is that it is now that much harder to break into screenwriting. Naturally, motion picture and television production firms responded by categorically declining to read ''all'' unsolicited screenplays from unknown writers;&lt;ref name="Rosman"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Rosman|first1=Kathleen|title=The Death of the Slush Pile|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052748703414504575001271351446274|accessdate=27 January 2015|work=Wall Street Journal|publisher=Dow Jones &amp; Company|date=22 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; accepting screenplays only through official channels like talent agents, managers, and attorneys; and forcing screenwriters to sign broad [[legal release]]s before their screenplays will be actually accepted, read, or considered.&lt;ref name="Biederman" /&gt; In turn, agents, managers, and attorneys have become extremely powerful gatekeepers on behalf of the major film studios and media networks.&lt;ref name="Rosman" /&gt; One symptom of how hard it is to break into screenwriting as a result of such case law is that in 2008, [[Universal Studios]] resisted construction of a bike path along the [[Los Angeles River]] next to its studio lot because it would worsen their existing problem with desperate amateur screenwriters throwing copies of their work over the studio wall.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Hymon|first1=Steve|author2=Andrew Blankstein|title=Studio poses obstacle to riverfront bike path|url=http://www.latimes.com/local/la-me-bikelane27feb27-story.html|accessdate=27 January 2015|work=Los Angeles Times|publisher=Tribune Company|date=27 February 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Under the Army Nomenclature System, the abbreviation '''SCR''' initially designated "Set, Complete Radio", but was later misinterpreted as "Signal Corps Radio."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Getting the message through: A Branch History of the U.S. Army Signal Corps|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=noEBBvjbwVMC&amp;pg=PA172|year=1996|publisher=Government Printing Office|isbn=978-0-16-087281-5|pages=172–}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Image:Scr300.png|thumb|right|200px|Example of a Signal Corps Radio set: the [[SCR-300]]-A]]

==Nomenclature==
The term SCR was part of a nomenclature system developed for the [[U.S. Signal Corps]], used at least as far back as [[World War I]]. Three-letter designators beginning with "SC" were used to denote complete systems, while one and two-letter designators (such as "BC", for basic component, "FT" for mounting, etc.) were used for components. Only a few system designators were used:

:::SCM   Set, Complete, Meteorological
:::SCR   Set, Complete, Radio
:::SCS   Set, Complete, System

==SCR radio sets==
The U.S. Signal Corps used the term "sets" to denote specific groupings of individual components such as transmitters, receivers, power supplies, handsets, cases, and antennas.  SCR radio sets ranged from the relatively small [[SCR-536]] "handie talkie" to high-powered, truck-mounted mobile communications systems like the [[SCR-299]] and large [[microwave radar]] systems such as the [[SCR-584 radar]].

==SCS==
The SCS designator was applied to groups of SCR-numbered sets comprising an extensive system, such as multiple radio sets employed in a ground-based fighter direction/control center.  The SCR designator could be a single transmitting or receiving set, or a full set of both transmitting and receiving equipment.

==Additional Designators==
An additional designator, "RC" was used for subsystems or groups of accessories. The [[Joint Electronics Type Designation System]] which came into use in 1943 absorbed or superseded the SC designations.&lt;ref name=ER&gt;{{cite web|last1=Mote|first1=Ray|title=World War Two Nomenclature Systems|url=http://www.hypertools.com/nomenclature.html|publisher=Electric Radio Magazine, June/July 1995|accessdate=8 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Zeppelin-Lindau (Do) D.I.jpg|thumb|The [[Zeppelin-Lindau D.I]] had stressed skin fuselage and wings.]]
In [[mechanical engineering]], '''stressed skin''' is a type of rigid construction, intermediate between [[monocoque]] and a rigid frame with a non-loaded covering. A stressed skin structure has its [[compression (physical)|compression]]-taking elements localized and its [[tension (physics)|tension]]-taking elements distributed.  Typically, the main frame has rectangular structure and is [[Polygon triangulation|triangulated]] by the covering.

== Description ==
[[File:MurphyMooseUnderConstruction.JPG|thumb|Internals of stressed skin construction on [[Murphy Moose]] showing frames and supporting skin]]
A framework box can be distorted from being square, so it isn't rigid by itself, however adding diagonals that take either tension or compression fixes this, because the box cannot deviate from right angles without altering the diagonals.
Sometimes flexible members like wires are used to provide tension, or rigid compression frames are used, as with a [[Warren truss|Warren]] or [[Pratt truss]], however both these are full frame structures.
When the skin or outer covering is in tension so that it provides a significant portion of the rigidity, the structure is said to have a stressed skin design. This may also be referred to as '''semi-monocoque''', and overlaps with [[monocoque]], which has less framing, sometimes only including longitudinal or lateral members and also overlaps with rigid frame structures where a minor portion of the overall stiffness may be derived from the skin. This method of construction is lighter than a full frame structure and not as complex to design as a full monocoque.

== Examples ==
Examples include nearly all modern all-metal [[airplanes]], as well as some railway vehicles, [[bus]]es and [[motorhome]]s. The [[London Transport (brand)|London Transport]] [[AEC Routemaster]] incorporated internal panels riveted to the frames which took most of the structure's shear load. Automobile [[Unibody|unibodies]] are a form a stressed skin as well, as are some framed buildings which lack diagonal bracing.

'''Synthetic biology''' is an interdisciplinary branch of [[biology]] and engineering.

The subject combines disciplines from within these domains, such as [[biotechnology]], [[genetic engineering]], [[molecular biology]], [[molecular engineering]], [[systems biology]], [[Model lipid bilayer|membrane science,]] [[biophysics]], [[biological engineering|chemical and biological engineering]], [[electrical engineering|electrical and computer engineering]], [[control engineering]] and [[evolutionary biology]]. Synthetic biology applies these disciplines to build artificial biological systems for research, engineering and medical applications.

== Definition ==
Synthetic biology is seen differently by biologists and engineers. Originally seen as part of biology, in recent years the role of electrical and chemical engineering has become more important. For example, one description designates synthetic biology as "an emerging discipline that uses engineering principles to design and assemble biological components".&lt;ref&gt;[http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/Xplore/defdeny.jsp?url=http%3A%2F%2Fieeexplore.ieee.org%2Fstamp%2Fstamp.jsp%3Ftp%3D%26arnumber%3D4472901&amp;denyReason=-134&amp;arnumber=4472901&amp;productsMatched=null&amp;userType=mem IEEE Xplore Abstract - Intellectual Property and the Commons in Synthetic Biology: Strategies to Facilitate an Emerging Tec...]&lt;/ref&gt; Another portrayed it as "a new emerging scientific field where ICT, biotechnology and nanotechnology meet and strengthen each other".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.synbiosafe.eu/uploads/pdf/Rathenau%20Constructing%20Life%202006.pdf W97 binnenwerk-8 - Rathenau Constructing Life 2006.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt;

The definition of synthetic biology is also debated in the [[human sciences]], [[arts]] and politics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.marsilius-kolleg.uni-heidelberg.de/marsilius-academy/index.html|title = Synthetic biology: promises and perils of modern biotechnology|access-date = 2014-09-11|website = Marsilius Academy Heidelberg – Summer school|publisher = Heidelberg University}}&lt;/ref&gt; One popular definition:&lt;ref name="NakanoEckford2013"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Nakano|first1=Tadashi|last2=Eckford|first2=Andrew W.|last3=Haraguchi|first3=Tokuko|title=Molecular Communication|url={{google books |plainurl=y |id=uVhsAAAAQBAJ}}|date=12 September 2013|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-1-107-02308-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The functional aspects of this definition are rooted in molecular biology and biotechnology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Hayden EC | title = Synthetic-biology firms shift focus | journal = Nature | volume = 505 | issue = 7485 | pages = 598 | date = January 2014 | pmid = 24476868 | doi = 10.1038/505598a | bibcode = 2014Natur.505..598C }}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Image:Protein translation.gif|thumb|300px| A [[ribosome]] is a [[biological machine]].]]
As usage of the term has expanded, synthetic biology was recently defined as the artificial design and engineering of biological systems and living organisms for purposes of improving applications for industry or biological research.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Osbourn AE, O'Maille PE, Rosser SJ, Lindsey K | title = Synthetic biology. 4th New Phytologist Workshop, Bristol, UK, June 2012 | journal = The New Phytologist | volume = 196 | issue = 3 | pages = 671–7 | date = November 2012 | pmid = 23043589 | doi = 10.1111/j.1469-8137.2012.04374.x }}&lt;/ref&gt; 
[[File:Synthetic Biology Open Language (SBOL) standard visual symbols.png|thumb|300x300px| [[Synthetic Biology Open Language]] (SBOL) standard visual symbols for use with [[BioBrick|BioBricks Standard]]]]
In general its purpose can be described as the design and construction of novel artificial biological pathways, organisms or devices, or the redesign of existing natural biological systems.

Synthetic biology has traditionally been divided into two different approaches. Top down synthetic biology involves using metabolic and genetic engineering techniques to impart new functions to living cells. Bottom up synthetic biology involves creating new biological systems ''in vitro'' by bringing together 'non-living' biomolecular components,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Schwille P | title = Bottom-up synthetic biology: engineering in a tinkerer's world | journal = Science | volume = 333 | issue = 6047 | pages = 1252–4 | date = September 2011 | pmid = 21885774 | doi = 10.1126/science.1211701 | bibcode = 2011Sci...333.1252S }}&lt;/ref&gt; often with the aim of constructing an [[artificial cell]]. Biological systems are thus assembled module-by-module. [[Cell-free protein synthesis|Cell-free protein expression systems]] are often employed,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Noireaux V, Libchaber A | title = A vesicle bioreactor as a step toward an artificial cell assembly | journal = Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America | volume = 101 | issue = 51 | pages = 17669–74 | date = December 2004 | pmid = 15591347 | pmc = 539773 | doi = 10.1073/pnas.0408236101 | bibcode = 2004PNAS..10117669N }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Hodgman CE, Jewett MC | title = Cell-free synthetic biology: thinking outside the cell | journal = Metabolic Engineering | volume = 14 | issue = 3 | pages = 261–9 | date = May 2012 | pmid = 21946161 | pmc = 3322310 | doi = 10.1016/j.ymben.2011.09.002 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Elani Y, Law RV, Ces O | title = Protein synthesis in artificial cells: using compartmentalisation for spatial organisation in vesicle bioreactors | journal = Physical Chemistry Chemical Physics | volume = 17 | issue = 24 | pages = 15534–7 | date = June 2015 | pmid = 25932977 | doi = 10.1039/C4CP05933F | bibcode = 2015PCCP...1715534E }}&lt;/ref&gt; as are membrane-based molecular machinery.  There are increasing efforts to bridge the divide between these approaches by forming hybrid living/synthetic cells,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Elani Y, Trantidou T, Wylie D, Dekker L, Polizzi K, Law RV, Ces O | title = Constructing vesicle-based artificial cells with embedded living cells as organelle-like modules | language = En | journal = Scientific Reports | volume = 8 | issue = 1 | pages = 4564 | date = March 2018 | pmid = 29540757 | pmc = 5852042 | doi = 10.1038/s41598-018-22263-3 | bibcode = 2018NatSR...8.4564E }}&lt;/ref&gt; and engineering communication between living and synthetic cell populations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Lentini R, Martín NY, Forlin M, Belmonte L, Fontana J, Cornella M, Martini L, Tamburini S, Bentley WE, Jousson O, Mansy SS | title = Two-Way Chemical Communication between Artificial and Natural Cells | language = EN | journal = ACS Central Science | volume = 3 | issue = 2 | pages = 117–123 | date = February 2017 | pmid = 28280778 | pmc = 5324081 | doi = 10.1021/acscentsci.6b00330 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
The first identifiable use of the term "synthetic biology" was in [[Stéphane Leduc]]’s publication of ''Théorie physico-chimique de la vie et générations spontanées'' (1910)&lt;ref&gt;[http://openlibrary.org/books/OL23348076M/Théorie_physico-chimique_de_la_vie_et_générations_spontanées Théorie physico-chimique de la vie et générations spontanées, S. Leduc, 1910]&lt;/ref&gt; and his ''La Biologie Synthétique'' (1912).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=http://www.peiresc.org/bstitre.htm |title=La biologie synthétique, étude de biophysique |last=Leduc |first=Stéphane |date=1912 | veditors = Poinat A }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A contemporary interpretation of synthetic biology was given by Polish geneticist [[Wacław Szybalski]] in a panel discussion during Eighteenth Annual "OHOLO" Biological Conference on Strategies for the Control of Gene Expression'' in 1973 [[Zichron Yaakov]], Israel.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| author = Dirk Stemerding, Virgil Rerimassie | title= Discourses on Synthetic Biology in Europe | publisher= Rathenau Instituut  | place= The Hague | date = 2013 | pages= 4|url=https://www.rathenau.nl/en/file/59/download?token=W_76_A_V}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| title= Proceedings of the Eighteenth Annual "OHOLO" Biological Conference  on Strategies for the Control of Gene Expression held March 27·30, 1973, at Zichron Yaakov, Israel | pages= 405 | isbn = 978-1-4684-3248-0 |chapter-url={{google books |plainurl=y |id=GC3vBwAAQBAJ}}| volume= Advances in Experimental Medicine and Biology, v. 44 | chapter= Panel  discussion | doi = 10.1007/978-1-4684-3246-6| series= Advances in Experimental Medicine and Biology | year= 1974 | citeseerx= 10.1.1.612.3122 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1978, [[Werner Arber|Arber]], [[Daniel Nathans|Nathans]] and [[Hamilton O. Smith|Smith]] won the [[Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine]] for the discovery of [[restriction enzyme]]s, leading Szybalski to offer an editorial comment in the journal ''[[Gene (journal)|Gene]]'':

&lt;blockquote&gt;The work on restriction nucleases not only permits us easily to construct recombinant DNA molecules and to analyze individual genes, but also has led us into the new era of synthetic biology where not only existing genes are described and analyzed but also new gene arrangements can be constructed and evaluated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Szybalski W, Skalka A | title = Nobel prizes and restriction enzymes | journal = Gene | volume = 4 | issue = 3 | pages = 181–2 | date = November 1978 | pmid = 744485 | doi = 10.1016/0378-1119(78)90016-1 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

A notable advance in synthetic biology occurred in 2000, when two articles in [[Nature (journal)|Nature]] discussed the creation of [[synthetic biological circuit]] devices of a genetic toggle switch and a biological clock by combining genes within [[Escherichia coli|''E. coli'']] cells.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Elowitz MB, Leibler S | title = A synthetic oscillatory network of transcriptional regulators | journal = Nature | volume = 403 | issue = 6767 | pages = 335–8 | date = January 2000 | pmid = 10659856 | doi = 10.1038/35002125 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Gardner TS, Cantor CR, Collins JJ | title = Construction of a genetic toggle switch in Escherichia coli | journal = Nature | volume = 403 | issue = 6767 | pages = 339–42 | date = January 2000 | pmid = 10659857 | doi = 10.1038/35002131 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Perspectives ==
Engineers view biology as a ''technology'' – a given system's ''[[biotechnology]]'' or its ''[[biological engineering]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | volume = 6 | last = Zeng | first = Jie (Bangzhe) | title = On the concept of systems bio-engineering | journal = Coomunication on Transgenic Animals, June 1994, CAS, PRC }}&lt;/ref&gt; Synthetic biology includes the broad redefinition and expansion of biotechnology, with the ultimate goals of being able to design and build engineered biological systems that process information, manipulate chemicals, fabricate materials and structures, produce energy, provide food, and maintain and enhance human health (see [[Biomedical Engineering]]) and our environment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | volume = 6 | last = Chopra | first = Paras | author2 = Akhil Kamma | title = Engineering life through Synthetic Biology | journal = In Silico Biology }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Studies in synthetic biology can be subdivided into broad classifications according to the approach they take to the problem at hand:
standardization of biological parts, biomolecular engineering, genome engineering. Biomolecular engineering includes approaches that aim to create a toolkit of functional units that can be introduced to present new technological functions in living cells. [[Genetic engineering]] includes approaches to construct synthetic chromosomes for whole or minimal organisms. Biomolecular design refers to the general idea of de novo design and additive combination of biomolecular components. Each of these approaches share a similar task: to develop a more synthetic entity at a higher level of complexity by inventively manipulating a simpler part at the preceding level.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Channon K, Bromley EH, Woolfson DN | title = Synthetic biology through biomolecular design and engineering | journal = Current Opinion in Structural Biology | volume = 18 | issue = 4 | pages = 491–8 | date = August 2008 | pmid = 18644449 | doi = 10.1016/j.sbi.2008.06.006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On the other hand, "re-writers" are synthetic biologists interested in testing the irreducibility of biological systems. Due to the complexity of natural biological systems, it would be simpler to rebuild the natural systems of interest from the ground up; In order to provide engineered surrogates that are easier to comprehend, control and manipulate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | first = M | last = Stone | title = Life Redesigned to Suit the Engineering Crowd | journal = Microbe | volume = 1 | issue = 12 | pages = 566–570 | date = 2006 | url = https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/8d45/e0f37a0fb6c1a3c659c71ee9c52619b18364.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt; Re-writers draw inspiration from [[refactoring]], a process sometimes used to improve computer software.

== Enabling technologies ==
Several novel enabling technologies were critical to the success of synthetic biology. Concepts include [[standardization]] of biological parts and hierarchical abstraction to permit using those parts in synthetic systems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Baker D, Church G, Collins J, Endy D, Jacobson J, Keasling J, Modrich P, Smolke C, Weiss R | title = Engineering life: building a fab for biology | journal = Scientific American | volume = 294 | issue = 6 | pages = 44–51 | date = June 2006 | pmid = 16711359 | doi = 10.1038/scientificamerican0606-44 | bibcode = 2006SciAm.294f..44B }}&lt;/ref&gt; Basic technologies include reading and writing DNA (sequencing and fabrication). Measurements under multiple conditions are needed for accurate modeling and computer-aided-design (CAD).

=== DNA and gene synthesis ===
{{Main|Artificial gene synthesis|Synthetic genomics}}Driven by dramatic decreases in costs of [[oligonucleotides|oligonucleotide]] ("oligos") synthesis, the sizes of DNA constructions from oligos have increased to the genomic level.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Kosuri S, Church GM|date=May 2014|title=Large-scale de novo DNA synthesis: technologies and applications|journal=Nature Methods|volume=11|issue=5|pages=499–507|doi=10.1038/nmeth.2918|pmid=24781323}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2000, researchers reported synthesis of the 9.6 kbp (kilo bp) [[Hepatitis C]] virus genome from chemically synthesized 60 to 80-mers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Blight KJ, Kolykhalov AA, Rice CM|date=December 2000|title=Efficient initiation of HCV RNA replication in cell culture|journal=Science|volume=290|issue=5498|pages=1972–4|bibcode=2000Sci...290.1972B|doi=10.1126/science.290.5498.1972|pmid=11110665}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2002 researchers at [[SUNY Stony Brook]] succeeded in synthesizing the 7741 bp [[poliovirus]] genome from its published sequence, producing the second synthetic genome, spanning two years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Couzin J|date=July 2002|title=Virology.

In 2007 it was reported that several companies were offering [[gene synthesis|synthesis of genetic sequences]] up to 2000 base pairs (bp) long, for a price of about $1 per bp and a turnaround time of less than two weeks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| issn = 0362-4331| last = Pollack| first = Andrew| title = How Do You Like Your Genes?

=== Sequencing ===
[[DNA sequencing]] determines the order of [[nucleotide]] bases in a DNA molecule. Synthetic biologists use DNA sequencing in their work in several ways. First, large-scale genome sequencing efforts continue to provide information on naturally occurring organisms. This information provides a rich substrate from which synthetic biologists can construct parts and devices. Second, sequencing can verify that the fabricated system is as intended. Third, fast, cheap, and reliable sequencing can facilitate rapid detection and identification of synthetic systems and organisms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| author = Rollie| date = 2012 |title = Designing biological systems: Systems Engineering meets Synthetic Biology| journal = Chemical Engineering Science| volume = 69 | pages = 1–29| url = http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0009250911007925| doi=10.1016/j.ces.2011.10.068| issue=1|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While DNA is most important for information storage, a large fraction of the cell's activities are carried out by proteins. Tools can send proteins to specific regions of the cell and to link different proteins together. The interaction strength between protein partners should be tunable between a lifetime of seconds (desirable for dynamic signaling events) up to an irreversible interaction (desirable for device stability or resilient to harsh conditions). Interactions such as [[coiled coil]]s,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Woolfson DN, Bartlett GJ, Bruning M, Thomson AR | title = New currency for old rope: from coiled-coil assemblies to α-helical barrels | journal = Current Opinion in Structural Biology | volume = 22 | issue = 4 | pages = 432–41 | date = August 2012 | pmid = 22445228 | doi = 10.1016/j.sbi.2012.03.002 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[SH3 domain]]-peptide binding&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Dueber JE, Wu GC, Malmirchegini GR, Moon TS, Petzold CJ, Ullal AV, Prather KL, Keasling JD | title = Synthetic protein scaffolds provide modular control over metabolic flux | journal = Nature Biotechnology | volume = 27 | issue = 8 | pages = 753–9 | date = August 2009 | pmid = 19648908 | doi = 10.1038/nbt.1557 }}&lt;/ref&gt; or SpyTag/SpyCatcher&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Reddington SC, Howarth M | title = Secrets of a covalent interaction for biomaterials and biotechnology: SpyTag and SpyCatcher | journal = Current Opinion in Chemical Biology | volume = 29 | pages = 94–9 | date = December 2015 | pmid = 26517567 | doi = 10.1016/j.cbpa.2015.10.002 }}&lt;/ref&gt; offer such control. In addition it is necessary to regulate protein-protein interactions in cells, such as with light (using [[light-oxygen-voltage-sensing domain]]s) or cell-permeable small molecules by [[chemically induced dimerization]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Bayle JH, Grimley JS, Stankunas K, Gestwicki JE, Wandless TJ, Crabtree GR | title = Rapamycin analogs with differential binding specificity permit orthogonal control of protein activity | journal = Chemistry &amp; Biology | volume = 13 | issue = 1 | pages = 99–107 | date = January 2006 | pmid = 16426976 | doi = 10.1016/j.chembiol.2005.10.017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a living cell, molecular motifs are embedded in a bigger network with upstream and downstream components. These components may alter the signalling capability of the modeling module. In the case of ultrasensitive modules, the sensitivity contribution of a module can differ from the sensitivity that the module sustains in isolation.&lt;ref name="altszylerUltrasens2014"&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Altszyler E, Ventura A, Colman-Lerner A, Chernomoretz A|date=October 2014|title=Impact of upstream and downstream constraints on a signaling module's ultrasensitivity|journal=Physical Biology|volume=11|issue=6|pages=066003|bibcode=2014PhBio..11f6003A|doi=10.1088/1478-3975/11/6/066003|pmc=4233326|pmid=25313165}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="altszylerUltrasens2017"&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Altszyler E, Ventura AC, Colman-Lerner A, Chernomoretz A|year=2017|title=Ultrasensitivity in signaling cascades revisited: Linking local and global ultrasensitivity estimations|journal=PLOS One|volume=12|issue=6|pages=e0180083|arxiv=1608.08007|bibcode=2017PLoSO..1280083A|doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0180083|pmid=28662096|pmc=5491127}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Modeling ===
Models inform the design of engineered biological systems by better predicting system behavior prior to fabrication. Synthetic biology benefits from better models of how biological molecules bind substrates and catalyze reactions, how DNA encodes the information needed to specify the cell and how multi-component integrated systems behave. Multiscale models of gene regulatory networks focus on synthetic biology applications. Simulations can model all biomolecular interactions in [[Transcription (biology)|transcription]], [[Translation (biology)|translation]], regulation and induction of gene regulatory networks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Kaznessis YN | title = Models for synthetic biology | journal = BMC Systems Biology | volume = 1 | issue = 1 | pages = 47 | date = November 2007 | pmid = 17986347 | pmc = 2194732 | doi = 10.1186/1752-0509-1-47 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Synthetic transcription factors ===
Studies have considered the components of the [[Transcription (biology)|DNA transcription]] mechanism. One desire of scientists creating [[synthetic biological circuit]]s is to be able to control the transcription of synthetic DNA in [[prokaryote]]s and [[eukaryote]]s. One study tested the adjustability of synthetic [[Transcription factor|transcription factors]] (sTFs) in areas of transcription output and cooperative ability among multiple transcription factor complexes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Khalil AS, Lu TK, Bashor CJ, Ramirez CL, Pyenson NC, Joung JK, Collins JJ | title = A synthetic biology framework for programming eukaryotic transcription functions | journal = Cell | volume = 150 | issue = 3 | pages = 647–58 | date = August 2012 | pmid = 22863014 | pmc = 3653585 | doi = 10.1016/j.cell.2012.05.045 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Researchers were able to mutate [[zinc finger]]s, the DNA specific component of sTFs, to decrease their affinity for specific operator DNA sequence sites, and thus decrease the associated site-specific activity of the sTF (usually transcriptional regulation). They further used the zinc fingers as components of complex-forming sTFs, which are the [[eukaryotic translation]] mechanisms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Khalil AS, Lu TK, Bashor CJ, Ramirez CL, Pyenson NC, Joung JK, Collins JJ | title = A synthetic biology framework for programming eukaryotic transcription functions | journal = Cell | volume = 150 | issue = 3 | pages = 647–58 | date = August 2012 | pmid = 22863014 | pmc = 3653585 | doi = 10.1016/j.cell.2012.05.045 | url = http://www.cell.com/article/S0092867412007805/abstract }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Applications ==
=== Biological computers ===
A [[biological computer]] refers to an engineered biological system that can perform computer-like operations, which is a dominant paradigm in synthetic biology.

=== Biosensors ===
A [[biosensor]] refers to an engineered organism, usually a bacterium,that  is capable of reporting some ambient phenomenon such as the presence of heavy metals or toxins.

=== Cell transformation ===
{{Main|Transformation (genetics)}}Cells use interacting genes and proteins, which are called gene circuits, to implement diverse function, such as responding to environmental signals, decision making and communication. Three key components are involved: DNA, RNA and Synthetic biologist designed gene circuits that can control gene expression from several levels including transcriptional, post-transcriptional and translational levels.

Traditional metabolic engineering has been bolstered by the introduction of combinations of foreign genes and optimization by directed evolution. This includes engineering ''E. coli'' and [[yeast]] for commercial production of a precursor of the [[Antimalarial medication|antimalarial drug]], [[Artemisinin]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Westfall PJ, Pitera DJ, Lenihan JR, Eng D, Woolard FX, Regentin R, Horning T, Tsuruta H, Melis DJ, Owens A, Fickes S, Diola D, Benjamin KR, Keasling JD, Leavell MD, McPhee DJ, Renninger NS, Newman JD, Paddon CJ|date=January 2012|title=Production of amorphadiene in yeast, and its conversion to dihydroartemisinic acid, precursor to the antimalarial agent artemisinin|journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America|volume=109|issue=3|pages=E111–8|bibcode=2012PNAS..109E.111W|doi=10.1073/pnas.1110740109|pmc=3271868|pmid=22247290}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Entire organisms have yet to be created from scratch, although living cells can be [[Transformation (genetics)|transformed]] with new DNA. Several ways allow constructing synthetic DNA components and even entire [[Artificial gene synthesis|synthetic genomes]], but once the desired genetic code is obtained, it is integrated into a living cell that is expected to manifest the desired new capabilities or [[phenotype]]s while growing and thriving.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/science/eureka-scientists-unveil-giant-leap-towards-synthetic-life-9219644.html|title=Eureka!

By integrating synthetic biology with [[materials science]], it would be possible to use cells as microscopic molecular foundries to produce materials with properties whose properties were genetically encoded. Re-engineering has produced Curli fibers, the [[amyloid]] component of extracellular material of [[biofilms]], as a platform for programmable [[nanomaterial]]. These nanofibers were genetically constructed for specific functions, including adhesion to substrates, nanoparticle templating and protein immobilization.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Nguyen PQ, Botyanszki Z, Tay PK, Joshi NS|date=September 2014|title=Programmable biofilm-based materials from engineered curli nanofibres|journal=Nature Communications|volume=5|pages=4945|bibcode=2014NatCo...5E4945N|doi=10.1038/ncomms5945|pmid=25229329}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Natural proteins can be engineered, e.g., by [[directed evolution]], novel protein structures that match or improve on the functionality of existing proteins can be produced. One group generated a [[helix bundle]] that was capable of binding [[oxygen]] with similar properties as [[hemoglobin]], yet did not bind [[carbon monoxide]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Koder RL, Anderson JL, Solomon LA, Reddy KS, Moser CC, Dutton PL | title = Design and engineering of an O(2) transport protein | journal = Nature | volume = 458 | issue = 7236 | pages = 305–9 | date = March 2009 | pmid = 19295603 | pmc = 3539743 | doi = 10.1038/nature07841 | bibcode = 2009Natur.458..305K }}&lt;/ref&gt; A similar protein structure was generated to support a variety of [[oxidoreductase]] activities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Farid TA, Kodali G, Solomon LA, Lichtenstein BR, Sheehan MM, Fry BA, Bialas C, Ennist NM, Siedlecki JA, Zhao Z, Stetz MA, Valentine KG, Anderson JL, Wand AJ, Discher BM, Moser CC, Dutton PL | title = Elementary tetrahelical protein design for diverse oxidoreductase functions | journal = Nature Chemical Biology | volume = 9 | issue = 12 | pages = 826–833 | date = December 2013 | pmid = 24121554 | pmc = 4034760 | doi = 10.1038/nchembio.1362 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Another group generated a family of G-protein coupled receptors that could be activated by the inert small molecule clozapine-N-oxide but insensitive to the native [[ligand]], [[acetylcholine]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Armbruster BN, Li X, Pausch MH, Herlitze S, Roth BL | title = Evolving the lock to fit the key to create a family of G protein-coupled receptors potently activated by an inert ligand | journal = Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America | volume = 104 | issue = 12 | pages = 5163–8 | date = March 2007 | pmid = 17360345 | pmc = 1829280 | doi = 10.1073/pnas.0700293104 | bibcode = 2007PNAS..104.5163A }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another common investigation is [[Expanded genetic code|expansion]] of the natural set of 20 [[amino acid]]s. Excluding [[stop codon]]s, 61 [[codons]] have been identified, but only 20 amino acids are coded generally in all organisms. Certain codons are engineered to code for alternative amino acids including: nonstandard amino acids such as O-methyl [[tyrosine]]; or exogenous amino acids such as 4-fluorophenylalanine. Typically, these projects make use of re-coded [[nonsense suppressor]] [[Transfer RNA|tRNA]]-[[Aminoacyl tRNA synthetase]] pairs from other organisms, though in most cases substantial engineering is required.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Wang Q, Parrish AR, Wang L|date=March 2009|title=Expanding the genetic code for biological studies|journal=Chemistry &amp; Biology|volume=16|issue=3|pages=323–36|doi=10.1016/j.chembiol.2009.03.001|pmc=2696486|pmid=19318213}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other researchers investigated protein structure and function by reducing the normal set of 20 [[amino acid]]s.

Researchers and companies practice synthetic biology to synthesize [[industrial enzymes]] with high activity, optimal yields and effectiveness.

=== Designed nucleic acid systems ===
Scientists can encode digital information onto a single strand of [[synthetic DNA]]. In 2012, [[George M. Church]] encoded one of his books about synthetic biology in DNA. The 5.3 [[Megabit|Mb]] of data was more than 1000 times greater than the previous largest amount of information to be stored in synthesized DNA.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Church GM, Gao Y, Kosuri S | title = Next-generation digital information storage in DNA | journal = Science | volume = 337 | issue = 6102 | pages = 1628 | date = September 2012 | pmid = 22903519 | doi = 10.1126/science.1226355 | bibcode = 2012Sci...337.1628C }}&lt;/ref&gt; A similar project encoded the complete [[sonnet]]s of [[William Shakespeare]] in DNA.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.sky.com/story/1041917/huge-amounts-of-data-can-be-stored-in-dna|title=Huge amounts of data can be stored in DNA|date=23 January 2013|publisher=Sky News|access-date=24 January 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160531044937/http://news.sky.com/story/1041917/huge-amounts-of-data-can-be-stored-in-dna|archive-date=2016-05-31 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many technologies have been developed for incorporating [[Nucleic acid analogue|unnatural nucleotides]] and amino acids into nucleic acids and proteins, both ''in vitro'' and ''in vivo''. For example, in May 2014, researchers announced that they had successfully introduced two new artificial [[nucleotides]] into bacterial DNA. By including individual artificial nucleotides in the culture media, they were able to exchange the bacteria 24 times; they did not generate [[Messenger RNA|mRNA]] or proteins able to use the artificial nucleotides.&lt;ref name="NYT-20140507"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2014/05/08/business/researchers-report-breakthrough-in-creating-artificial-genetic-code.html|title=Researchers Report Breakthrough in Creating Artificial Genetic Code|last=Pollack|first=Andrew|date=May 7, 2014|work=[[New York Times]]|access-date=May 7, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="NATURE-20140507"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Callaway|first=Ewen|date=May 7, 2014|title=First life with 'alien' DNA|url=http://www.nature.com/news/first-life-with-alien-dna-1.15179|journal=[[Nature (journal)|Nature]]|doi=10.1038/nature.2014.15179|access-date=May 7, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="NATJ-20140507"&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Malyshev DA, Dhami K, Lavergne T, Chen T, Dai N, Foster JM, Corrêa IR, Romesberg FE|date=May 2014|title=A semi-synthetic organism with an expanded genetic alphabet|journal=Nature|volume=509|issue=7500|pages=385–8|bibcode=2014Natur.509..385M|doi=10.1038/nature13314|pmc=4058825|pmid=24805238}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One important topic in synthetic biology is ''synthetic life'', that is concerned with hypothetical organisms created ''[[in vitro]]'' from [[biomolecule]]s and their component materials. Synthetic life experiments attempt to either probe the [[origins of life]], study some of the properties of life, or more ambitiously to recreate life from non-living ([[abiotic components|abiotic]]) components. Synthetic life biology attempts to create living organisms capable of carrying out important functions, from manufacturing pharmaceuticals to detoxifying polluted land and water.&lt;ref name="enzymes2014"&gt;{{cite news |last=Connor |first=Steve |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/science/major-synthetic-life-breakthrough-as-scientists-make-the-first-artificial-enzymes-9896333.html |title=Major synthetic life breakthrough as scientists make the first artificial enzymes |work=The Independent |location=London |date=1 December 2014 |access-date=2015-08-06 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In medicine, it offers prospects of using designer biological parts as a starting point for new classes of therapies and diagnostic tools.&lt;ref name="enzymes2014" /&gt;

A living "artificial cell" has been defined as a completely synthetic cell that can capture [[energy]], maintain [[electrochemical gradient|ion gradients]], contain [[macromolecules]] as well as store information and have the ability to [[mutate]].&lt;ref name='Deamer'&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Deamer D | title = A giant step towards artificial life? | journal = Trends in Biotechnology | volume = 23 | issue = 7 | pages = 336–8 | date = July 2005 | pmid = 15935500 | doi = 10.1016/j.tibtech.2005.05.008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Nobody has been able to create such a cell.&lt;ref name='Deamer'/&gt;

The first living organism with 'artificial' expanded DNA code was presented in 2014; the team used ''E. coli'' that had its genome extracted and replaced with a chromosome with an expanded genetic code. The [[nucleoside]]s added are [[d5SICS]] and [[dNaM]].&lt;ref name="NATJ-20140507"/&gt;

=== Drug delivery platforms ===
==== Engineered bacteria-based platform ====
Bacteria have long been used in cancer treatment. ''[[Bifidobacterium]]'' and ''[[Clostridium]]'' selectively colonize tumors and reduce their size.&lt;ref name="Zu_2014"&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Zu C, Wang J|date=August 2014|title=Tumor-colonizing bacteria: a potential tumor targeting therapy|url=|journal=Critical Reviews in Microbiology|volume=40|issue=3|pages=225–35|doi=10.3109/1040841X.2013.776511|pmid=23964706}}&lt;/ref&gt; Recently synthetic biologists reprogrammed bacteria to sense and respond to a particular cancer state. Most often bacteria are used to deliver a therapeutic molecule directly to the tumor to minimize off-target effects. To target the tumor cells, [[peptide]]s that can specifically recognize a tumor were expressed on the surfaces of bacteria. Peptides used include an [[Affibody molecule|affibody]] molecule that specifically targets human [[Epidermal growth factor receptor|epidermal growth factor receptor 2]]&lt;ref name="Gujrati_2014"&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Gujrati V, Kim S, Kim SH, Min JJ, Choy HE, Kim SC, Jon S|date=February 2014|title=Bioengineered bacterial outer membrane vesicles as cell-specific drug-delivery vehicles for cancer therapy|url=|journal=ACS Nano|volume=8|issue=2|pages=1525–37|doi=10.1021/nn405724x|pmid=24410085}}&lt;/ref&gt; and a synthetic [[Adhesin molecule (immunoglobulin -like)|adhsin]].&lt;ref name="Piñero-Lambea_2015"&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Piñero-Lambea C, Bodelón G, Fernández-Periáñez R, Cuesta AM, Álvarez-Vallina L, Fernández LÁ|date=April 2015|title=Programming controlled adhesion of E. coli to target surfaces, cells, and tumors with synthetic adhesins|journal=ACS Synthetic Biology|volume=4|issue=4|pages=463–73|doi=10.1021/sb500252a|pmc=4410913|pmid=25045780}}&lt;/ref&gt; The other way is to allow bacteria to sense the [[tumor microenvironment]], for example hypoxia, by building an AND logic gate into bacteria.&lt;ref&gt;I.V.

WeissComposing a tumor specific bacterial promoter PLOS One, 11 (5) (2016), p. e0155338, 10.1371/journal.pone.0155338&lt;/ref&gt; The bacteria then only release target therapeutic molecules to the tumor through either [[lysis]]&lt;ref&gt;Rice KC, Bayles KW (2008) Molecular control of bacterial death and lysis. Microbiol Mol Biol Rev 72: 85–109.&lt;/ref&gt; or the [[bacterial secretion system]].&lt;ref&gt;Ganai, S., Arenas, R. B. &amp; Forbes, N. S. Tumour-targeted delivery of TRAIL using Salmonella typhimurium enhances breast cancer survival in mice. Br. J. Cancer 101, 1683–1691 (2009).&lt;/ref&gt; Lysis has the advantage that it can stimulate the immune system and control growth. Multiple types of secretion systems can be used and other strategies as well. The system is inducible by external signals. Inducers include chemicals, electromagnetic or light waves.

Multiple species and strains are applied in these therapeutics. Most commonly used bacteria are ''[[Salmonella enterica subsp. enterica|Salmonella typhimurium]]'', [[Escherichia coli|''Escherichia Coli'']], ''Bifidobacteria'', ''[[Streptococcus]]'', ''[[Lactobacillus]]'', ''[[Listeria]]'' and ''[[Bacillus subtilis]]''. Each of these species have their own property and are unique to cancer therapy in terms of tissue colonization, interaction with immune system and ease of application.

==== Cell-based platform ====
The immune system plays an important role in cancer and can be harnessed to attack cancer cells. Cell-based therapies focus on [[Cancer immunotherapy|immunotherapies]], mostly by engineering [[T cell]]s.

T cell receptors were engineered and ‘trained’ to detect cancer [[epitope]]s. [[Chimeric antigen receptor]]s (CARs) are composed of a fragment of an [[antibody]] fused to intracellular T cell signaling domains that can activate and trigger proliferation of the cell. A second generation CAR-based therapy was approved by FDA.{{Citation needed|date=April 2018}}

Gene switches were designed to enhance safety of the treatment. Kill switches were developed to terminate the therapy should the patient show severe side effects.&lt;ref&gt;Jones, B.S., Lamb, L.S., Goldman, F. &amp; Di Stasi, A. Improving the safety of cell therapy products by suicide gene transfer. Front. Pharmacol. 5, 254 (2014).&lt;/ref&gt; Mechanisms can more finely control the system and stop and reactivate it.&lt;ref&gt;Wei  P, Wong  WW, Park  JS, Corcoran  EE, Peisajovich  SG, Onuffer  JJ, Weiss  A, LiWA. 2012.

A synchronized quorum of genetic clocks. Nature 463, 326–330 (2010).&lt;/ref&gt; Since the number of T-cells are important for therapy persistence and severity, growth of T-cells is also controlled to dial the effectiveness and safety of therapeutics.&lt;ref&gt;Y. Y. Chen, M. C. Jensen, C. D. Smolke, Genetic control of mammalian T-cell proliferation with synthetic RNA regulatory systems. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 107, 8531 (2010). doi:10.1073/pnas.1001721107 {{PMID|20421500}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although several mechanisms can improve safety and control, limitations include the difficulty of inducing large DNA circuits into the cells and risks associated with introducing foreign components, especially proteins, into cells.

=== European Union ===

The [[European Union]]-funded project SYNBIOSAFE&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.synbiosafe.eu/ SYNBIOSAFE official site]&lt;/ref&gt; has issued reports on how to manage synthetic biology. A 2007 paper identified key issues in safety, security, ethics and the science-society interface, which the project defined as public education and ongoing dialogue among scientists, businesses, government and ethicists.&lt;ref name=Priorities&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Schmidt M, Ganguli-Mitra A, Torgersen H, Kelle A, Deplazes A, Biller-Andorno N | title = A priority paper for the societal and ethical aspects of synthetic biology | journal = Systems and Synthetic Biology | volume = 3 | issue = 1–4 | pages = 3–7 | date = December 2009 | pmid = 19816794 | pmc = 2759426 | doi = 10.1007/s11693-009-9034-7 | url = http://www.synbiosafe.eu/uploads/pdf/Schmidt_etal-2009-SSBJ.pdf | format = PDF }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Schmidt M.

Key ethical issues concerned the creation of new life forms.

A subsequent report focused on biosecurity, especially the so-called [[dual use technology|dual-use]] challenge. For example, while synthetic biology may lead to more efficient production of medical treatments, it may also lead to synthesis or modification of harmful pathogens (e.g., [[smallpox]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Kelle A | title = Ensuring the security of synthetic biology-towards a 5P governance strategy | journal = Systems and Synthetic Biology | volume = 3 | issue = 1–4 | pages = 85–90 | date = December 2009 | pmid = 19816803 | pmc = 2759433 | doi = 10.1007/s11693-009-9041-8  | format = PDF }}&lt;/ref&gt; The biohacking community remains a source of special concern, as the distributed and diffuse nature of open-source biotechnology makes it difficult to track, regulate or mitigate potential concerns over biosafety and biosecurity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Schmidt M | title = Diffusion of synthetic biology: a challenge to biosafety | journal = Systems and Synthetic Biology | volume = 2 | issue = 1–2 | pages = 1–6 | date = June 2008 | pmid = 19003431 | pmc = 2671588 | doi = 10.1007/s11693-008-9018-z | url = http://www.markusschmidt.eu/pdf/Diffusion_of_synthetic_biology.pdf | format = PDF }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== United States ===

In January 2009, the [[Alfred P. Sloan Foundation]] funded the [[Woodrow Wilson Center]], the [[Hastings Center]], and the [[J. Craig Venter Institute]] to examine the public perception, ethics and policy implications of synthetic biology.&lt;ref&gt;Parens E., Johnston J., Moses J. [http://www.thehastingscenter.org/who-we-are/our-research/selected-past-projects/ethical-issues-in-synthetic-biology-2/ Ethical Issues in Synthetic Biology.] 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

On July 9–10, 2009, the National Academies' Committee of Science, Technology &amp; Law convened a symposium on "Opportunities and Challenges in the Emerging Field of Synthetic Biology".&lt;ref&gt;[http://sites.nationalacademies.org/PGA/stl/PGA_050738 NAS Symposium official site]&lt;/ref&gt;

After the publication of the [[Mycoplasma laboratorium|first synthetic genome]] and the accompanying media coverage about "life" being created, President [[Barack Obama]] established the [[Presidential Commission for the Study of Bioethical Issues]] to study synthetic biology.&lt;ref&gt;Presidential Commission for the study of Bioethical Issues, December 2010 [http://bioethics.gov/node/353 FAQ]&lt;/ref&gt; The commission convened a series of meetings, and issued a report in December 2010 titled "New Directions: The Ethics of Synthetic Biology and Emerging Technologies." The commission stated that "while Venter’s achievement marked a significant technical advance in demonstrating that a relatively large genome could be accurately synthesized and substituted for another, it did not amount to the “creation of life”.&lt;ref&gt;[http://bioethics.gov/node/353 Synthetic Biology F.A.Q.'s | Presidential Commission for the Study of Bioethical Issues]&lt;/ref&gt; It noted that synthetic biology is an emerging field, which creates potential risks and rewards. The commission did not recommend policy or oversight changes and called for continued funding of the research and new funding for monitoring, study of emerging ethical issues and public education.&lt;ref name="bioethics.gov" /&gt;

Synthetic biology, as a major tool for biological advances, results in the "potential for developing biological weapons, possible unforeseen negative impacts on human health ... and any potential environmental impact".&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Erickson B, Singh R, Winters P | title = Synthetic biology: regulating industry uses of new biotechnologies | journal = Science | volume = 333 | issue = 6047 | pages = 1254–6 | date = September 2011 | pmid = 21885775 | doi = 10.1126/science.1211066 | bibcode = 2011Sci...333.1254E }}&lt;/ref&gt; These security issues may be avoided by regulating industry uses of biotechnology through policy legislation.

=== Opposition ===
On March 13, 2012, over 100 environmental and civil society groups, including [[Friends of the Earth]], the [[International Center for Technology Assessment]] and the [[ETC Group (AGETC)|ETC Group]] issued the manifesto ''The Principles for the Oversight of Synthetic Biology''. This manifesto calls for a worldwide moratorium on the release and commercial use of synthetic organisms until more robust regulations and rigorous biosafety measures are established. The groups specifically call for an outright ban on the use of synthetic biology on the [[human genome]] or [[human microbiome]].&lt;ref&gt;Katherine Xue for Harvard Magazine.

[http://www.scidev.net/global/genomics/news/ngos-call-for-international-regulation-of-synthetic-biology.html NGOs call for international regulation of synthetic biology]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Richard Lewontin]] wrote that some of the safety tenets for oversight discussed in ''The Principles for the Oversight of Synthetic Biology'' are reasonable, but that the main problem with the recommendations in the manifesto is that "the public at large lacks the ability to enforce any meaningful realization of those recommendations".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nybooks.com/articles/archives/2014/may/08/new-synthetic-biology-who-gains/?insrc=rel#fnr-1 The New Synthetic Biology: Who Gains?] (2014-05-08), [[Richard C.

== Health and safety ==
As research procedures scale up to industrial processes, the number and variety of workers exposed to commercial synthetic biology risk is expected to increase.  Exposure to [[Lentiviral vector|lentiviral vectors]] is one important health hazard.  Hazard controls include increased [[workplace health surveillance]] and proactive risk assessment and management, as well as biocontainment methods.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Howard|first=John|last2=Murashov|first2=Vladimir|last3=Schulte|first3=Paul|date=2016-10-18|title=Synthetic biology and occupational risk|journal=Journal of Occupational and Environmental Hygiene|language=en|volume=14|issue=3|pages=224–236|doi=10.1080/15459624.2016.1237031|pmid=27754800|issn=1545-9624}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Risk assessment may be more difficult for organisms constructed from individual synthetic genetic components since they do not occur in nature.

The '''T.M.C. Asser Instituut''' (established in 1965) is a professional inter-university centre of knowledge and research. The institute carries out research in private and public international law, European law, international commercial arbitration and all other related fields, such as international sports law and international humanitarian and criminal law. It is based in [[The Hague]] and it is affiliated to the [[University of Amsterdam]].

The institute is named after [[Tobias Michael Carel Asser]] (1838–1913), who was a [[Netherlands|Dutch]] jurist, and co-winner (with [[Alfred Fried]]) of the [[Nobel Prize for Peace]] in 1911 for his role in the formation of the Permanent Court of Arbitration at the first Hague peace conference (1899). He also advocated for the creation of an international academy of law, which led to founding of the ''Revue de Droit International et de Législation Comparée'' with [[John Westlake]] and [[Gustave Rolin-Jaequemyns]], the [[Institut de Droit International]] and the creation of the [[Hague Academy of International Law]].

==Fundamental research==
Besides the research facilities for its team of expert researchers, the Institute has access to an extensive international network of academic and scientific contacts. The T.M.C. Asser Instituut aims to develop young talent. The Asser Dissertations Programme offers promising young lawyers the opportunity to work on their research.
The funding and appointment of new candidates is done in collaboration with other institutions, preferably law faculties.

==Contract-research and legal advice==
Besides fundamental research, the institute focuses on contract research and consultancy work. This ranges from tailored consultancy finding (ad hoc) solutions for small legal issues to coordination and/or export of long-term structural (research) projects. Clients include among others the [[European Union]], national governments, ministries, international organizations, and law firms.

==Publisher==
The institute has its own [[publisher]]: [[T.M.C. Asser Press]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.asser.nl/asserpress/|title=Asser Press|last=|first=|date=|website=www.asser.nl/asserpress|language=en|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The following journals and yearbooks are being published: The Netherlands Yearbook of International Law (NYIL), Yearbook of International Humanitarian Law (YIHL), Netherlands International Law Review (NILR), Nederlands Internationaal Privaatrecht (NIPR) and European Business Organization Law Review (EBOR).

==Conferences and events==

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3294">'''T5 retrofit conversion''' is a means of converting [[Light fixture|light fittings]] designed to use [[T8 Lamp|T8 format lamps]], so that they can use more energy-efficient T5 lamps.&lt;ref name="ct"&gt;{{Cite web|title=How to implement T5 retrofit conversion kits|url=http://www.carbontrust.com/resources/reports/advice/lighting|publisher=The Carbon Trust|accessdate=2009-11-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is done by electronically converting the luminaires to high frequency operation.&lt;ref name="sie"&gt;{{Cite web|title=Save It Easy|url=http://www.saveiteasy.co.uk/product-info/how-it-works/|accessdate=2009-11-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Differences from other fluorescent lamps==
{{See also|T5_fluorescent_lamp#Differences_with_other_fluorescent_lamps|l1=T5 fluorescent lamp}}

T5 lamps are approximately 40% smaller than [[T8 Lamp]]s. T5 lamps have a miniature bi-pin base while T8 lamps use a medium bi-pin base.&lt;ref name="lrc"&gt;{{Cite web|title=T5 Fluorescent Systems|url=http://www.lrc.rpi.edu/programs/nlpip/lightingAnswers/lat5/abstract.asp|publisher=Lighting Research Center|accessdate=2009-11-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Conversion technology==
[[Conversion kits]] are available which will work in existing fittings containing switch start, mains frequency [[fluorescent lamp]] ballasts. The kits convert the fittings to use energy efficient, high frequency ballasts and accommodate the smaller diameter T5 lamp.&lt;ref name="ct" /&gt;

The magnetic ballast remains in place but it is bypassed, rendering it ineffective as a conductor. The new high-frequency ballast draws only 2&amp;nbsp;[[Watt|W]], rather than the 6-10&amp;nbsp;W of the old ballast, increasing the efficiency of the system.&lt;ref name="bsd"&gt;{{Cite web|title=New generation energy efficient fluorescent tubes: triphosphor|url=http://www.bsdlive.co.uk/story.asp?storycode=3110142|publisher=Building Sustainable Design|accessdate=2009-11-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; Changing to this type of lamp without taking the ballast out of operation (rather than simply bypassing it) results in an increased power factor for the fitting. This increase in power is a result of the separate coils used in an electric ballast, as opposed to the single coil in a magnetic ballast, because it allows the electricity to flow more consistently.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.thegrowlightdistrict.com/2015/08/t5-vs-t8/&lt;/ref&gt;

There are tree main types of conversion kits:
* '''Lamp-end type''' – Kits which include a replacement starter and two separate components to fit over each end of the T5 lamp. The lamp is then slotted into the existing fitting.
* '''Baton type''' – One piece kits which slot into the existing fitting and into which the T5 lamp is placed.&lt;ref name="ct" /&gt;
* '''IP65 types''' –  Waterproof [http://store.elam-lighting.eu/en/t5-retrofit-energy-save IP65 T5-module]

==Energy efficiency==
T5 retrofit conversion can maintain existing lighting levels at up to 65% reduction in energy use.&lt;ref name="sie" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7379">The '''Hartwell Paper''' called for a reorientation of [[climate policy]] after the perceived failure in [[2009 United Nations Climate Change Conference|2009 of the UNFCCC climate conference in Copenhagen]]. It was a response to the [[United Nations]]' [[Kyoto Protocol]], a previous international agreement meant to reduce [[greenhouse gas]] emissions. The paper was published in May 2010 by the [[London School of Economics]] in cooperation with the [[University of Oxford]]. The authors are 14 natural and social scientists from Asia, Europe and North America, including [[Mike Hulme]], [[Roger A. Pielke (Jr)]], [[Nico Stehr]] and [[Steve Rayner]], who met under the [[Chatham House Rule]].&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://eprints.lse.ac.uk/27939/1/HartwellPaper_English_version.pdf|title=The Hartwell Paper|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The authors saw the [[Great Recession|2009 economic crisis]] as an opportunity to re-evaluate global priorities. They argued that "decarbonisation will only be achieved successfully as a benefit contingent upon other goals which are politically attractive and relentlessly pragmatic."

[[File:Hartwell House, Bucks.jpg| thumb | right | 200px | [[Hartwell House, Buckinghamshire|Hartwell House]], where the meetings took place.]]

They emphasize [[human dignity]] as a necessary guiding principle for climate [[Climate policy|policy]]: "To reframe the climate issue around matters of human dignity is not just noble or necessary. It is also likely to be more effective than the approach of framing around human sinfulness – which has failed and will continue to fail."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.europeanbusinessreview.com/?p=2303 EU Climate Policy after the Crash of 09.] The European Business Review, September 2010 {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140325063036/http://www.europeanbusinessreview.com/?p=2303 |date=25 March 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

This principle of human dignity is expanded to three main objectives:
* 1. Energy access for all - the paper advocates taking investments in the innovations of renewable energy to decrease energy costs and to make them more affordable to society. Only this diversification of energy could extend the access to energy, especially in undeveloped countries.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

* 2. Development that does not interfere with essential Earth systems.
* 3. Societies well equipped to withstand climate-related dangers.

Their ultimate goal is "to develop non-carbon energy supplies at unsubsidised costs less than those using [[fossil fuels]]."&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;[http://www.lse.ac.uk/collections/mackinderProgramme/theHartwellPaper The Hartwell Paper.] [[London School of Economics]], May 2010&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.economist.com/world/international/displayStory.cfm?story_id=16099521 Oblique strategies], [[The Economist]], 11 May 2010&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/science/nature/8673828.stm After the crash - a new direction for climate policy.] BBC News, 11 May 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

The Hartwell Paper recommends that they are to achieve this goal by introducing low [[carbon]] [[Carbon tax|taxes]]. However, this money is able to be used to develop a CO2 free energy supply.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Kyoto and Climate Change Misconceptions ==

"The previous 'Kyoto' model has dangerously narrowed the option space for thinking seriously and realistically about energy and environmental policies. The Hartwell Paper wishes to contribute to a new pragmatism in the policy discourse surrounding climate change. To this end, we gathered at Hartwell House in Buckinghamshire in February 2010 and this paper is the base of our work".

The Hartwell Paper argues that, although we should attempt to reduce climate change, we must also prepare to adapt if necessary. According to the authors, the Kyoto principles implied that adaptation to the environment should be seen as a failure to halt climate change. Those at the Hartwell meeting proposed that these strategies; mitigation, and adaptation, should both be employed. This is to keep in mind the dignity of those who would be most affected while simultaneously slowing global warming.

The following are climate myths presented in the paper:
* '''Climate change is a problem that must be solved''' - "Rather than being a discrete problem to be solved. Climate change is better understood as a persistent condition that must be coped with and can only be partially managed more – or less – well. It is just one part of a larger complex of such conditions encompassing population, technology, wealth disparities, resource use, etc."&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

* '''The "deficit model" of science''' - The idea that the lack of information hinders the making of environmental progress. Once the science is understood by all, an agreement can be reached. The Hartwell authors call this a myth, saying that it doesn't address the varying political and religious ideologies that can result in differing interpretations of scientific data. "In turn, this error has led to the common and flawed assumption that the solutions to climate change should be ‘science driven’ as if a shared understanding of science will lead to a political consensus."&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

== Key Features of Hartwell Plan ==

The authors propose a holistic model of environmental practice. They believe there has been too much emphasis placed on carbon dioxide as if it is our only problematic emission. They state that while the CO2 reduction is central to the plan, smaller changes in a variety of practices and industries are also important.
* Diversification and moving away from fossil fuels
* Eradication of "Black Carbon" - Black Carbon is simply soot, which can come from burning wood or coal within the home. This has an environmental effect far greater (per ton) than simple CO2. According to the authors, this is an important step to take, as it should be much easier than phasing out gasoline.
* Reduce Tropospheric Ozone
* Protect Tropical Forests
* The "Kaya Identity" - these are four primary factors when it comes to a region's environmental footprint. They are population, wealth, energy intensity, and carbon intensity. Nations face different environmental issues, and the solution for one is not the solution for all.

== Reception and Criticism ==

The Hartwell Paper has received both praise and criticism. According to The Economist, the Hartwell approach to decarbonisation has been a source of controversy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.economist.com/node/16099521|title=Oblique strategies|date=2010-05-11|work=The Economist|access-date=2017-12-04|issn=0013-0613}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because large, rapidly industrializing nations are driven by fossil fuels, the authors claim that slowing this process just isn't politically feasible. ''The Economist'' article argues that Hartwell's "oblique strategies" may be more difficult to turn into policy than a more direct attack on carbon dioxide emissions.

'''''The War for Late Night: When Leno Went Early and Television Went Crazy''''' is a 2010 [[non-fiction]] book written by ''[[The New York Times]]'' media reporter Bill Carter. It chronicles the [[2010 Tonight Show conflict|2010 conflict]] surrounding the American late-night talk show ''[[The Tonight Show]]'' involving [[Conan O'Brien]] and [[Jay Leno]]. It is a sequel to Carter's 1994 book ''[[The Late Shift (book)|The Late Shift]]'', which detailed the struggle  for the hosting spot on ''The Tonight Show'' between [[David Letterman]] and [[Jay Leno]] in the early 1990s following the retirement of [[Johnny Carson]]. It was first published on November 4, 2010, by [[Viking Press]].

The book received a generally favorable reception from reviewers including ''[[Associated Press]]'', ''[[BusinessWeek]]'', ''[[The Buffalo News]]'', ''[[New York Magazine]]'', ''[[Star Tribune]]'', ''[[The Hollywood Reporter]]'', ''[[The Washington Post]]'', ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'', ''[[New York Post]]'', ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'', ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'', and [[ABC News]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2144">The '''usage'''  of a [[language]] is the manner in which the written and spoken language is used, the "points of [[grammar]], [[syntax]], [[Style guide|style]], and the choice of words",&lt;ref&gt;[[Henry Watson Fowler|H. W. Fowler]]'s ''[[A Dictionary of Modern English Usage]]''&lt;/ref&gt; and "the way in which a word or phrase is normally and correctly used". The usage of a language can mean the way people actually use the language, or [[Linguistic prescription|prescriptively]] the way one group feels that people ought to use it.&lt;ref name=JB&gt;{{Cite book|first=Jeremy|last=Butterfield|year=2008|title=Damp Squid: The English Language Laid Bare|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=Oxford|isbn=9780199574094|pages=137–138}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[The Chicago Manual of Style]]'' says "the great mass of linguistic issues that writers and editors wrestle with don't really concern grammar at all—they concern usage: the collective habits of a language's native speakers",&lt;ref name=CMOS&gt;{{cite book|author=University of Chicago|title=The Chicago Manual of Style|edition=16th|year=2010|publisher=University of Chicago Press|location=Chicago|isbn=9780199574094|pages=261–262}}&lt;/ref&gt; and "the standards of good usage change, however slowly."&lt;ref name=CMOS /&gt;

[[Dictionary|Dictionaries]] are not always accurate guides to "good usage". "Despite occasional usage notes, [[Lexicography|lexicographers]] generally disclaim any intent to guide writers and editors on the thorny points of English usage."&lt;ref name=CMOS /&gt;

==History==

According to Jeremy Butterfield, "The first person we know of who made ''usage'' refer to language was [[Daniel Defoe]], at the end of the seventeenth century". Defoe proposed the creation of a [[Linguistic prescription|language society]] of 36 individuals who would set prescriptive language rules for the approximately six million English speakers.&lt;ref name=JB /&gt;

A '''Wickelphone''' is a sequence of three letters or symbols, which occur together in a [[word]].  For example, the word ''strip'' may be decomposed into a set of [[trigram]]s such as ''rip'' and ''str'' &amp;mdash; these are Wickelphones.  The term was devised by [[James McClelland (psychologist)|James McClelland]] and [[David Rumelhart]] in reference to the work of [[Wayne Wickelgren]] in 1969.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |author=[[Steven Pinker]], A. Prince |title=Connections and symbols |page=89 |chapter=Language and connectionism |publisher=MIT Press |year=1989 |isbn=978-0-262-66064-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Rumelhart and McClelland then extended the idea by expressing the triples in [[phonetic]] terms as '''Wickelfeatures'''.  For example, the Wickelphone ''tri'' would correspond to a Wickelfeature of "[[stop consonant|stop]], [[lateral consonant|lateral]], [[vowel]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |page=98 |title=Social networks and historical sociolinguistics |author=Alexander Bergs |year=2005 |isbn=978-3-11-018310-8 |chapter=Personal pronouns}}&lt;/ref&gt;
