'''5.1 surround sound''' ("five-point one") is the common name for six channel [[surround sound]] audio systems. 5.1 is the most commonly used layout in [[home cinema]].{{cn|date=December 2016}} It uses five full bandwidth channels and one [[low-frequency effects]] channel (the "point one").&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.crutchfield.com/S-bDkeT92VqJj/learn/learningcenter/home/hometheater_surround.html |title=Understanding Surround Sound Formats |publisher=Crutchfield.com |date=23 September 2009 |accessdate=2011-03-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Dolby Digital]], Dolby [[Pro Logic II]], [[DTS (sound system)|DTS]], [[Sony dynamic digital sound|SDDS]], and [[THX]] are all common 5.1 systems. 5.1 is also the standard surround sound audio component of [[digital broadcast]] and music.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.5dot1.com/what_is_5_1_.html |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120317220352/http://www.5dot1.com/what_is_5_1_.html |archivedate=17 March 2012 |title=What is 5.1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

All 5.1 systems use the same speaker channels and configuration, having a front left and right, a [[center channel]], two [[surround channels]] and the [[low-frequency effects]] channel designed for a [[subwoofer]].

==History==
A prototype for five-channel surround sound, then dubbed "quintaphonic sound", was used in the 1975 film ''[[Tommy (1975 film)|Tommy]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Quintaphonic Sound|author=Mosely, John|journal= Journal of the SMPTE|volume=l86|date=January 1977}}&lt;/ref&gt;

5.1 dates back to 1976{{cn|date=December 2016}} when Dolby Labs modified the track usage of the six analogue magnetic soundtracks on [[Todd-AO#Todd-AO process|Todd-AO 70 mm film prints]]. The Dolby application of optical matrix encoding in 1976 (released on the film, ''[[Logan's Run (film)|Logan's Run]]'') did not use split surrounds, and thus was not 5.1. Dolby's first use of split surrounds was with 70mm film, which received wide release in 1979 with ''[[Apocalypse Now]]''. Instead of the five screen channels and one surround channel of the Todd-AO format, [[Dolby Stereo 70 mm Six Track]] provided three screen channels, two high-passed surround channels and a low-frequency surround channel monophonically blended with the two surround channels.

When digital sound was applied to 35&amp;nbsp;mm release prints, starting with ''[[Batman Returns]]'' in 1992, the 5.1 layout was adopted. The ability to provide 5.1 sound had been one of the key reasons for using 70&amp;nbsp;mm for prestige screenings. The provision of 5.1 digital sound on 35&amp;nbsp;mm significantly reduced the use of the very expensive 70&amp;nbsp;mm format. Digital sound and the 5.1 format were introduced in 1990, by KODAK and Optical Radiation Corporation, with releases of ''[[Days of Thunder]]'' and ''[[The Doors (film)|The Doors]]'' using the CDS (Cinema Digital Sound) format.

5.1 digital surround, in the forms of Dolby Digital AC3 and DTS, started appearing on several mid 90s Laserdisc releases, with among the earliest being ''[[Clear and Present Danger (film)|Clear and Present Danger]]'' and ''[[Jurassic Park (film)|Jurassic Park]]'' (the latter having both AC3 and DTS versions). Many DVD releases have Dolby Digital tracks up to 5.1 channels, due to the implementation of Dolby Digital in the development of the DVD format. In addition, some DVDs have DTS tracks with most being 5.1 channel mixes (a few releases, however, have 6.1 “[[Matrix decoder|matrixed]]” tracks). [[Blu-ray]] and [[digital cinema]] both have eight-channel capability which can be used to provide either 5.1 or [[7.1 surround sound]]. 7.1 is an extension of 5.1 that uses four surround zones: two at the sides and two at the back.

A system of digital 5.1 surround sound has also been used in 1987 at the Parisian cabaret the [[Moulin Rouge]], created by French engineer Dominique Bertrand. To achieve such a system in 1985 a dedicated mixing console had to be designed in cooperation with [[Solid State Logic]], based on their 5000 series, and dedicated speakers in cooperation with APG.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.apg.tm.fr/recherche-developpement-apg-france.html |title=Recherche &amp; Développement |accessdate=2015-12-17 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080803041440/http://www.apg.tm.fr/recherche-developpement-apg-france.html |archivedate=3 August 2008 }}&lt;!--could not an archive or alternative URL--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; The console included ABCDEF channels. Respectively: A left, B right, C centre, D left rear, E right rear, F bass.  The same engineer had already developed a similar 3.1 system in 1973, for use at the official International Summit of Francophone States in [[Dakar]].

==Application==

===Channel order===
The order of channels in a 5.1 file is different across file formats. The order in [[WAV file]]s is (not complete) Front Left, Front Right, Center, [[Low-frequency effects]], Surround Left, Surround Right.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/hardware/dn653308%28v=vs.85%29.aspx |title=Multiple channel audio data and WAVE files |accessdate=2015-11-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Music ===
[[File:5-1-surround-sound.svg|thumb|Suggested configuration for 5.1 music listening.]]

Regarding music, the main goal of 5.1 surround sound is a proper localization and equability of all acoustic sources for a centered positioned audience. Therefore, ideally five matched speakers should be used.

For play-back of 5.1 music recommendations of the [[International Telecommunication Union]] (ITU) have been released and propose the following configuration (ITU-R BS 775):&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=http://www.aes.org/e-lib/browse.cfm?elib=9095 |author=Thomas Lund |title=Enhanced Localization in 5.1 Production |publisher=Audio Engineering Society |date=1 September 2000 |accessdate=2015-11-19 |subscription=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* five speakers of the same size for front, center and surround
* identical distance from the listeners for all five speakers
* angle adjustment regarding viewing direction of audience: center 0°, front ±22.5° for movies ±30° for music, surround ±110°

'''AACE International''' (Association for the Advancement of [[Cost engineering|Cost Engineering]]) was founded in 1956 by 59 cost estimators and cost engineers during the organizational meeting of the [[American Association of Cost Engineering]] at the [[University of New Hampshire]] in [[Durham, New Hampshire|Durham]], [[New Hampshire]].  AACE International Headquarters is located in [[Morgantown, West Virginia|Morgantown]], [[West Virginia]], USA.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Amos|first=Jennie|title=The Rich History of AACE International|journal=Cost Engineering|date=July 2005|volume=47|issue=7|pages=5–7}}&lt;/ref&gt; AACE is a [[501(c)(3)]] non-profit professional association. AACE International is a member of the Board of the Council of Engineering and Scientific Specialty Boards (CESB).

== Activities ==
AACE is a non-profit organization with about 15 employees at its headquarters in Morgantown, WV.    A variety of other organizations  in the United States provide similar certifications,  often specialized for particular industries, such as power, manufacturing, gas and oil.

AACE is the publisher of ''Cost Engineering'', a bi-monthly technical journal, ''Skills and Knowledge of Cost Engineering'' (currently in its 6th edition), Source magazine (a bi-monthly magazine), 20 different AACE International ''Professional Practice Guides'', approximately 80 Recommended Practices, and its most comprehensive publication, the ''[[Total Cost Management]] Framework: An Integrated Approach to Portfolio, Program and Project Management''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://web.aacei.org/resources/publications|title=Publications|website=web.aacei.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Certification programs==
AACE currently manages eight [[certification]] programs&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://web.aacei.org/certification/certifications-offered|title=Certifications Offered|website=web.aacei.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;, as  listed below. All require agreeing to adhere to a canons of ethics, and passing an examination. Most require prior industry experience, and also involve recertification by continuing education or reexamination.  

*''Certified Cost Technician'' (formerly known as Interim Cost Consultant), an entry-level certification and is not eligible for renewal
*''Certified Scheduling Technician'', an entry level certification
*''Certified Cost Professional (formerly Certified Cost Consultant / Certified Cost Engineer),'' which additionally requires a technical paper submission 
*''Certified Estimating Professional'' 
*''Certified Forensic Claims Consultant'', which has additional requirements, including submission of a publication
*''Decision &amp; Risk Management Professional''
*''Earned Value Professional''
*''Planning &amp; Scheduling Professional''

Since becoming a charter member of the Council of Engineering and Scientific Specialty Boards in 1990, six of its certification programs (CCP, CCT, CEP, CST, EVP and PSP) have been accredited by the CESB.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://web.aacei.org/certification/accreditation-annual-reports|title=Accreditation Annual Reports|website=web.aacei.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Italiano]], web: [http://wwwusers.di.uniroma1.it/~finocchi/papers/EATCSBullet.ps http://wwwusers.di.uniroma1.it/~finocchi/papers/EATCSBullet.ps]&lt;/ref&gt;
It is a general methodology for algorithmic research.&lt;ref name="AEDef"&gt;"Algorithm Engineering – An Attempt at a Definition", [[Peter Sanders (computer scientist)|Peter Sanders]], web: [http://algo2.iti.kit.edu/documents/definition.pdf http://algo2.iti.kit.edu/documents/definition.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origins==

In 1995, a report from an [[National Science Foundation|NSF]]-sponsored workshop "with the purpose of assessing the current goals and directions of the Theory of Computing (TOC) community" identified the slow speed of adoption of theoretical insights by practitioners as an important issue and suggested measures to
* reduce the uncertainty by practitioners whether a certain theoretical breakthrough will translate into practical gains in their field of work, and
* tackle the lack of ready-to-use algorithm libraries, which provide stable, bug-free and well-tested implementations for algorithmic problems and expose an easy-to-use interface for library consumers.&lt;ref name="EOTCS"&gt;"Emerging Opportunities for Theoretical Computer Science", Aho, Johnson, Karp, Kosaraju, McGeoch, Papadimitriou, web: [http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/summary?doi=10.1.1.55.9160 http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/summary?doi=10.1.1.55.9160]&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;!-- Scientists have encountered a widening gap between theoretical insights and their application in software engineering disciplines. While algorithm theory provides the mathematical foundation to discover ..., it often does not meet the practical requirements of software engineering. --&gt;
 
But also, promising algorithmic approaches have been neglected due to difficulties in mathematical analysis.&lt;ref name="AEDef"/&gt;
&lt;!-- Algorithm engineering was mentioned as one of the approaches to speed up adoption .... --&gt;

The term "algorithm engineering" was first used with specificity in 1997, with the first Workshop on Algorithm Engineering (WAE97), organized by [[Giuseppe Francesco Italiano|Giuseppe F. Italiano]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dsi.unive.it/~wae97 Workshop on Algorithm Engineering]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Difference from algorithm theory==
 
Algorithm engineering does not intend to replace or compete with algorithm theory, but tries to enrich, refine and reinforce its formal approaches with [[experimental algorithmics]] (also called empirical algorithmics).

This way it can provide new insights into the efficiency and performance of algorithms in cases where
* the algorithm at hand is less amenable to algorithm theoretic analysis,
* formal analysis pessimistically suggests bounds which are unlikely to appear on inputs of practical interest,
* the algorithm relies on the intricacies of modern hardware architectures like data locality, branch prediction, instruction stalls, instruction latencies which the machine model used in Algorithm Theory is unable to capture in the required detail,
* the crossover between competing algorithms with different constant costs and asymptotic behaviors needs to be determined.&lt;ref name="AE"/&gt;&lt;ref name="TDEA"&gt;"Towards a Discipline of Experimental Algorithmics", Bernard M. E. Moret, web: [http://infoscience.epfl.ch/record/97865/files/dimacs_algorithmics.pdf http://infoscience.epfl.ch/record/97865/files/dimacs_algorithmics.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Methodology==

Some researchers describe algorithm engineering's methodology as a cycle consisting of algorithm design, analysis, implementation and experimental evaluation, joined by further aspects like machine models or realistic inputs.
They argue that equating algorithm engineering with [[experimental algorithmics]] is too limited, because viewing design and analysis, implementation and experimentation as separate activities ignores the crucial feedback loop between those elements of algorithm engineering.&lt;ref name="AEDef"/&gt;

===Realistic models and real inputs===

While specific applications are outside the methodology of algorithm engineering, they play an important role in shaping realistic models of the problem and the underlying machine, and supply real inputs and other design parameters for experiments.&lt;ref name="AEDef"/&gt;

===Design===
Compared to algorithm theory, which usually focuses on the asymptotic behavior of algorithms, algorithm engineers need to keep further requirements in mind: Simplicity of the algorithm, implementability in programming languages on real hardware, and allowing code reuse.
Additionally, constant factors of algorithms have such a considerable impact on real-world inputs that sometimes an algorithm with worse asymptotic behavior performs better in practice due to lower constant factors.

===Analysis===
Some problems can be solved with heuristics and randomized algorithms in a simpler and more efficient fashion than with deterministic algorithms. Unfortunately, this makes even simple randomized algorithms ''difficult to analyze because there are subtle dependencies to be taken into account''.&lt;ref name="AEDef"/&gt;

===Implementation===
Huge semantic gaps between theoretical insights, formulated algorithms, programming languages and hardware pose a challenge to efficient implementations of even simple algorithms, because small implementation details can have rippling effects on execution behavior.
The only reliable way to compare several implementations of an algorithm is to spend an considerable amount of time on tuning and profiling, running those algorithms on multiple architectures, and looking at the generated machine code.&lt;ref name="AEDef"/&gt;

===Experiments===
See: [[Experimental algorithmics]]

===Application engineering===
Implementations of algorithms used for experiments differ in significant ways from code usable in applications.
While the former prioritizes fast prototyping, performance and instrumentation for measurements during experiments, the latter requires ''thorough testing, maintainability, simplicity, and tuning for particular classes of inputs''.&lt;ref name="AEDef"/&gt;

===Algorithm libraries===
Stable, well-tested algorithm libraries like [[Library of Efficient Data types and Algorithms|LEDA]] play an important role in technology transfer by speeding up the adoption of new algorithms in applications. 
Such libraries reduce the required investment and risk for practitioners, because it removes the burden of understanding and implementing the results of academic research.

==Conferences==
Two main conferences on Algorithm Engineering are organized annually, namely:
* Symposium on Experimental Algorithms (SEA), established in 1997 (formerly known as WEA).
* SIAM Meeting on Algorithm Engineering and Experiments (ALENEX), established in 1999.

The 1997 Workshop on Algorithm Engineering (WAE'97) was held in Venice (Italy) on September 11–13, 1997. The Third International Workshop on Algorithm Engineering (WAE'99) was held in London, UK in July 1999.&lt;ref&gt;

'''Atomic gardening''' is a form of [[mutation breeding]] where plants are exposed to radioactive sources, typically [[cobalt-60]],&lt;ref name="Twilley"/&gt; in order to generate [[mutation]]s, some of which turned out to be useful.

The practice of plant irradiation has resulted in the development of over two thousand new varieties of plants, most of which are now used in agricultural production.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Ahloowalia|first=B.

==History==

Beginning in the 1950s, atomic gardens were a part of [[Atoms for Peace]], a program to develop peaceful&lt;ref name="Pruned-2011-04-atom"/&gt; uses of [[Nuclear fission|fission]] energy after [[World War II]]. Gamma gardens were established in laboratories in the [[United States]], [[Europe]], parts of the former [[USSR]], [[India]],&lt;ref name="Auto15-1"/&gt; and [[Japan]]. Though these gardens were initially designed with the aim of testing the effects of [[radiation]] on plant life, research gradually turned towards using radiation to introduce beneficial mutations that could give plants useful characteristics. Such characteristics include increased resilience to adverse weather, or a faster growth rate.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; In addition, the Atomic Gardening Society was established in 1959 by [[Muriel Howorth]], an atomic activist from the [[United Kingdom]], in conjunction with a growing movement to bring atomic energy and experimentation into the lives of ordinary citizens.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://99percentinvisible.org/episode/atom-garden-eden/|title=Atom in the Garden of Eden|last=Mars|first=Roman|date=|work=99% Invisible|access-date=2017-04-30|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1960, Howorth published a book entitled "Atomic Gardening for the Layman" along a similar theme.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.atomicgardening.com/downloads/atomic-gardening-for-the-layman/|title=Atomic Gardening for the Layman|last=Johnson|first=Paige|date=|website=www.atomicgardening.com|language=en-US|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2017-04-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; Notably, the Atomic Gardening Society utilized an early form of [[crowd-sourcing]], in which members received irradiated seeds, planted them in their gardens, and sent reports back to Howorth detailing the results.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.atomicgardening.com/1960/02/21/the-atomic-gardening-society/|title=The Atomic Gardening Society|last=Johnson|first=Paige|date=1960-02-21|website=Atomic Gardening: A timeline of events|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2017-04-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; Howorth herself made national news upon growing a two-foot-tall peanut plant after planting an irradiated nut.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; The youngest member of the society was Christopher Abbey (15), a student at Eastbourne College and the son of a dentist, who received a certificate of merit for propagating several species of irradiated seeds to maturity. Irradiated seeds were sold to the public by C.J. Speas, a [[Tennessee]] dentist who had obtained a license for a cobalt-60 source; and sold seeds produced in a backyard cinderblock bunker. Speas did so upon seeing an opportunity for amateur gardeners to get involved in testing.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Howorth, in an effort to give the members of her society a broader selection, began ordering seeds from Speas in large quantities. By 1960, Speas had reportedly shipped Howorth over three and a half million seeds, which were then distributed to nearly a thousand individual Society members.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

Despite the initial enthusiasm, the Atomic Gardening Society declined by the mid 1960s. This was due to a combination of a shifting political climate away from [[atomic energy]] and a failure on the part of the [[crowd sourced]] Society to produce noteworthy results.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{cite book|title=Evolution Made to Order: Plant Breeding and Technological Innovation in Twentieth-Century America.|last=Curry|first=Helen Anne|publisher=University of Chicago Press|year=2016|isbn=9780226390116|location=Chicago, IL, US|pages=182}}&lt;/ref&gt; In spite of this, large-scale gamma gardens remained in use, and a number of commercial plant varieties were developed and released by laboratories and private companies alike.&lt;ref name="Garden History Girl"/&gt;

Gamma gardens were typically five acres in size, and were arranged in a circular pattern with a retractable radiation source in the middle. Plants were usually laid out like slices of a pie, stemming from the central radiation source; this pattern produced a range of radiation doses over the radius from the center. Radioactive bombardment would take place for around twenty hours, after which scientists wearing protective equipment would enter the garden and assess the results.&lt;ref name=":0"/&gt; The plants nearest the center usually died, while the ones further out often featured "tumors and other growth abnormalities". Beyond these were the plants of interest, with a higher than usual range of mutations, though not to the damaging extent of those closer to the radiation source.&lt;ref name="Pruned-2011-04-atom"/&gt; These gamma gardens have continued to operate on largely the same designs as those conceived in the 1950s.&lt;ref name="Twilley"/&gt;

Research into the potential benefits of atomic gardening has continued, most notably through a joint operation between the [[International Atomic Energy Agency]] and the U.N.'s [[Food and Agriculture Organization]].&lt;ref name=":1"/&gt; Japan's [[Institute of Radiation Breeding]] is well-known for its modern-day usage of atomic gardening techniques.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.naro.affrc.go.jp/archive/nias/eng/org/GR/IRB/|title=Institute of Radiation Breeding|last=|first=|date=|website=www.naro.affrc.go.jp|language=en|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2017-04-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cultural significance==
The popularity of atomic gardening coincided with a [[postwar]] society seeking to put newly-discovered [[atomic energy]] to use. Many scientists and members of the public believed that atomic energy could be harnessed to address a great number of worldwide issues, including famine and energy shortages, leading them to embrace the new atomic era.&lt;ref name=":3"/&gt; Some scientists that had worked on the military application of atomic energy in the past invested in or sponsored programs dedicated to bringing more peaceful applications of atomic energy to the public domain, and this included atomic gardening. As public skepticism of atomic energy grew, and as [[nuclear arsenal]]s continued to increase in size across the globe, atomic gardening fell out favor, along with other Atoms for Peace initiatives.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.atomicgardening.com/1966/03/01/whatever-happened-to-the-atomic-garden/|title=Disillusionment and Demise|last=Johnson|first=Paige|date=1966-03-01|website=Atomic Gardening: A timeline of events|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2017-04-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In popular culture==
{{Fiction trivia|date=April 2015}}

Atomic gardens are part of the background of the plot of ''[[The Effect of Gamma Rays on Man-in-the-Moon Marigolds]]'' which features the growth of irradiated seeds as a science fair project.&lt;ref name="Pruned-2011-04-atom"/&gt; The [[Dilbert]] comic strip contains a reference to atomic gardening in form of sentient broccoli.&lt;ref name="Dilbert"/&gt;

[[Hardcore punk]] band [[Bad Religion]] published the song "Atomic Garden" on the 1992 album ''[[Generator (Bad Religion album)|Generator]]''.

'''Authenticity''' is a concept in [[psychology]] (in particular [[Existential psychotherapy|existential psychiatry]]) as well as [[existentialism|existentialist philosophy]] and [[aesthetics]] (in regard to various arts and musical genres). In existentialism, authenticity is the degree to which an individual's actions are congruent with their beliefs and desires, despite external pressures; the [[consciousness|conscious]] [[Philosophy of self|self]] is seen as coming to terms with being in a material world and with encountering external forces, pressures, and influences which are very different from, and other than, itself. A lack of authenticity is considered in existentialism to be ''[[bad faith (existentialism)|bad faith]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/authenticity/ Authenticity (Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy)&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; The call of authenticity resonates with the famous instruction by the [[Pythia|Oracle of Delphi]], “[[Know thyself]].” But authenticity extends this message: "Don’t merely know thyself – be thyself."&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Abulof|first=Uriel|date=2017-12-01|title=Be Yourself!

Views of authenticity in cultural activities vary widely. For instance, the philosophers [[Jean Paul Sartre]] and [[Theodor Adorno]] had opposing views regarding jazz, with Sartre considering it authentic and Adorno inauthentic. The concept of authenticity is often aired in  musical subcultures, such as [[punk rock]] and [[Heavy metal music|heavy metal]], where a purported lack of authenticity is commonly labeled with the epithet "[[poseur]]".&lt;ref name="indiecult2006"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.indiecult.com/2006-04/television-personalities-my-dark-places |title=Homeward Bound.

==Theories==

===Existentialism===
One of the greatest problems facing such abstract approaches is that the drives people call the "needs of one's inner being" are diffuse, subjective, and often culture-bound. For this reason among others, authenticity is often "at the limits" of language; it is described as the negative space around inauthenticity, with reference to examples of inauthentic living.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Golomb | first = Jacob | title = In Search of Authenticity | publisher = Routledge | year = 1995 | location = London and New York | pages = | url = | doi = | id = | isbn = 0-415-11946-4 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Sartre's novels are perhaps the easiest access to this mode of describing authenticity: they often contain characters and [[antihero]]es who base their actions on external pressures—the pressure to appear to be a certain kind of person, the pressure to adopt a particular mode of living, the pressure to ignore one's own moral and aesthetic objections in order to have a more comfortable existence. His work also includes characters who do not understand their own reasons for acting, or who ignore crucial facts about their own lives in order to avoid uncomfortable truths; this connects his work with the philosophical tradition.

Sartre is concerned also with the "[[vertiginous]]" experience of absolute freedom. In Sartre's view, this experience, necessary for the state of authenticity, can be so unpleasant that it leads people to inauthentic ways of living. Typically, authenticity is seen as a very general concept, not attached to any particular political or aesthetic ideology. This is a necessary aspect of authenticity: because it concerns a person's ''relation'' with the world, it cannot be arrived at by simply repeating a set of actions or taking up a set of positions. In this manner, authenticity is connected with creativity: the impetus to action must arise from the person in question, and not be externally imposed. Heidegger takes this notion to the extreme, by speaking in very abstract terms about modes of living (his terminology was adopted and simplified by Sartre in his philosophical works). Kierkegaard's work (e.g. "Panegyric Upon Abraham" from ''[[Fear and Trembling]]'') often focuses on biblical stories which are not directly imitable. Sartre, as has been noted above, focused on inauthentic existence as a way to avoid the paradoxical problem of appearing to provide prescriptions for a mode of living that rejects external dictation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Baird | first = Forrest E. | authorlink = |author2= Walter Kaufmann | title = From Plato to Derrida | publisher = Pearson Prentice Hall | year = 2008 | location = Upper Saddle River, New Jersey | pages = | url = | doi = | id = | isbn = 0-13-158591-6 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Authenticity, according to Kierkegaard, is reliant on an individual finding authentic faith and becoming true to oneself. Kierkegaard develops the idea that news media and the bourgeois church-Christianity present challenges for an individual in society trying to live authentically. Kierkegaard thus sees “both the media and the church as intervening agencies, blocking people’s way to true experiences, authenticity, and God. “&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"&gt;Kristoffer Holt, “Authentic Journalism? A Critical Discussion about Existential Authenticity in Journalism Ethics,” Journal of Mass Media Ethics 27 (2012)&lt;/ref&gt; His conviction lies with the idea that mass-culture creates a loss of individual significance, which he refers to as “levelling.” Kierkegaard views the media as supporting a society that does not form its own opinions but utilizes the opinions constructed by the news. Similarly, he interprets religion as a tradition that is passively accepted by individuals, without the inclusion of authentic thought. Kierkegaard believes that authentic faith can be achieved by “facing reality, making a choice and then passionately sticking with it.”&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"/&gt; The goal of Kierkegaard's existentialist philosophy is to show that, in order to achieve authenticity, one must face reality and form his own opinions of existence. So as not to be discouraged by levelling, Kierkegaard suggests, “One must make an active choice to surrender to something that goes beyond comprehension, a leap of faith into the religious.”&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"/&gt; Even if one does not want to put forth the effort of developing his own views, he must do so in the quest for authentic faith.

Nietzsche's view of authenticity is an atheist interpretation of Kierkegaard. He rejects the role of religion in finding authenticity because he believes in finding truth without the use of virtues. Nietzsche believes of the authentic man as the following: Someone who elevates himself over others in order to transcend the limits of conventional morality in an attempt to decide for oneself about [[good and evil]], without regard for the virtues “on account of which we hold our grandfathers in esteem.”&lt;ref name="autogenerated1997"&gt;Nietzsche, F.W., &amp; Zimmern, H. (1997). Beyond good and evil: Prelude to a philosophy of the future. Mineola, NY: Dover.&lt;/ref&gt; Nietzsche rejects the idea of religious virtues due to the lack of questioning by the individual. One must avoid what he calls “herding animal morality,”&lt;ref name="autogenerated1997"/&gt; if he is to find authenticity. To “stand alone” and avoid religiously constructed principles, it is essential to be “strong and original enough to initiate opposite estimates of value, to transvaluate and invert ‘eternal valuations.’”&lt;ref name="autogenerated1997"/&gt; One must be a free thinker and theorize views outside of their predilections. The commonality of Kierkegaard and Nietzsche’s existential philosophies is “the responsibilities they place on the individual to take active part in the shaping of one’s beliefs and then to be willing to act on that belief.”&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"/&gt; For Nietzsche, the secular mentality is a form of weakness and, for authenticity to be achieved, one must truly transcend conventional morality.

According to Abulof, authenticity's calling – being true to oneself – deceivingly conceals the deep chasms between two divergent interpretations of the "self": essentialist and existentialist. Essentialist authenticity demands we find and follow our preordained destiny, our inborn core. Conversely, existentialist authenticity prescribes “determine your destiny!” urging people to become aware of their freedom to choose their own path, which may, but need not, join that of others. While essentialists search for signs of self-betrayals, existentialists defiantly ask, “How am I not myself?” and answer: only when I forget my freedom, and surrender to “bad faith.” Otherwise, my choices – whatever they might be – constitute me.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Abulof|first=Uriel|date=2017-12-01|title=Be Yourself! How Am I Not myself?|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s12115-017-0183-0|journal=Society|language=en|volume=54|issue=6|pages=530–532|doi=10.1007/s12115-017-0183-0|issn=0147-2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Existential journalism====
[[List of existentialists|Existential philosophers]] like [[Kierkegaard]], [[Nietzsche]], and [[Heidegger]] investigate the existential-ontological significance of societally constructed norms to decipher authenticity. For an existential journalist, this aversion to, and turning away from, an unquestioning acceptance of norms contributes to the production of an authentic work. [[J. C. Merrill|Merrill]] believes that authentic journalism can exist if the journalist is true to one's self and rejects conformism. There are traditions that exist in media and news outlets that prevent journalists from achieving authenticity. Like Kierkegaard's view of media and church, Merrill believes that journalists are “gladly sacrificing individual authenticity to adapt nicely to the highly regimented, [[depersonalized]] corporate structure.”&lt;ref name="autogenerated1995"&gt;Merril, J.C. (1995). Existential Journalism (rev. ed.) Ames, IA: Iowa State University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Journalists are restricted by “institutional red tape” and, thus, cannot achieve authenticity. It is beneficial for journalists to adhere to the “red tape” because their work will be published.

Actively shaping one's own belief and then acting upon that belief is a laborious task. A journalist that hesitates in writing a story because it is not within the norm is unable to achieve authenticity because of the notion that following the norm is more valuable than being authentic. The contention is, however, that “individual freedom and courage to act is more valuable than collective adherence to journalistic codes of conduct.”&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"/&gt; As journalists make conscious decisions to write authentically, they are able to contribute more value in their work. The consequence of authentic writing is positive and ensures that the journalist, according to Merrill, “grows, matures, creates himself, and projects himself into the future.”&lt;ref name="autogenerated1995"/&gt;

====Criticisms====
Philosopher [[Jacob Golomb]] argues that the existentialist notion of authenticity is incompatible with a morality that values all persons.&lt;ref&gt;Golomb, Jacob (1995). ''In Search of Authenticity: From Kierkegaard to Camus''. London: Routledge.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Erich Fromm===
A very different definition of authenticity was proposed by [[Erich Fromm]]&lt;ref&gt;Fromm. E., Escape from Freedom, Farrar &amp; Rinehart 1941 (also published as "Fear of Freedom" Routledge UK 1942)&lt;/ref&gt; in the mid-1900s. He considered behavior of any kind, even that wholly in accord with societal mores, to be authentic if it results from personal understanding and approval of its drives and origins, rather than merely from conformity with the received wisdom of the society.  Thus a Frommean authentic may behave consistently in a manner that accords with cultural norms, for the reason that those norms appear on consideration to be appropriate, rather than simply in the interest of conforming with current norms. Fromm thus considers authenticity to be a positive outcome of enlightened and informed motivation rather than a negative outcome of rejection of the expectations of others. He described the latter condition – the drive primarily to escape external restraints typified by the "absolute freedom" of Sartre – as "the illusion of individuality",&lt;ref&gt;Fromm E., Fear of Freedom, ch. 7&lt;/ref&gt; as opposed to the genuine individuality that results from authentic living.

===Other perspectives===
Those who advocate [[Reform movement|social reform]] value the study of authenticity since it can provide a radical manifesto and an overview of the shortcomings of social structures. Michael Kernis and Brian Goldman defined authenticity as "the unimpeded operation of one's true or core self in one's daily enterprise."&lt;ref&gt;Wright, Karen (May 01, 2008). [http://www.psychologytoday.com/articles/200804/dare-be-yourself "Dare to be yourself"]. ''Psychology Today''.&lt;/ref&gt;

While authenticity may be a goal intrinsic to "the good life," it is often a difficult state to actually achieve, due in part to social pressures to live inauthentically and in part to a person's own character. It is also described as a revelatory state, where one perceives oneself, other people, and sometimes even things, in a radically new way. Some writers argue that authenticity also requires self-knowledge, and that it alters a person's relationships with other people. Authenticity also carries with it its own set of moral obligations, which often exist regardless of race, gender and class. The notion of authenticity also fits into [[utopia]]n ideology, which requires authenticity among its citizens to exist, or which claims that such a condition would remove physical and economic barriers to pursuing authenticity.

==History==
Secular and religious notions of authenticity have coexisted for centuries under different guises; perhaps the earliest account of authenticity that remains popular is [[Socrates]]' admonition that "the unexamined life is not worth living". In aesthetics, "[[Authenticity in art|authenticity]]" describes the perception of art as faithful to the artist's self, rather than conforming to external values such as historical tradition, or commercial worth.{{Citation needed|date=May 2008}} A common definition of "authenticity" in [[psychology]] refers to the attempt to live one's life according to the needs of one's inner being, rather than the demands of society or one's early conditioning.&lt;ref&gt;Wood, A. M., Linley, P. A., Maltby, J., Baliousis, M., Joseph, S. (2008) [http://personalpages.manchester.ac.uk/staff/alex.wood/Authenticity%20Scale.pdf The authentic personality: "A theoretical and empirical conceptualization, and the development of the Authenticity Scale"].

The search for authenticity is a hallmark of romantic modernity. Romanticists since the late 18th century prescribed intuition, emotion and a return to nature as a necessary corrective, even an antidote, to Enlightenment's “cold” reason.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/935280039|title=Creative Imagination.|last=James.|first=Engell,|date=1980|publisher=HUP|isbn=9780674333253|location=Cambridge|oclc=935280039}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the twentieth century, Anglo-American discussions of authenticity often center around the writings of a few key figures associated with [[existentialism|existentialist philosophy]], where the term originated; because most of these writers wrote in languages other than English, the process of translating and anthologizing has had a strong impact on the debate. [[Walter Kaufmann (philosopher)|Walter Kaufmann]] might be credited with creating a "canon" of existentialist writers which include [[Søren Kierkegaard]], [[Martin Heidegger]], and [[Jean-Paul Sartre]]. For these writers, the [[consciousness|conscious]] [[Philosophy of self|self]] is seen as coming to terms with being in a material world and with encountering external forces and influences which are very different from itself; authenticity is one way in which the self acts and changes in response to these pressures.

The call of, and for, authenticity - "be theyself!" - has pervaded modern thought and culture. A [https://books.google.com/ngrams/interactive_chart?content=be+yourself&amp;year_start=1800&amp;year_end=2018&amp;corpus=15&amp;smoothing=3&amp;share=&amp;direct_url=t1%3B%2Cbe%20yourself%3B%2Cc0 Google ngram (1800-2008)] indicates the dramatic rise, since the 1960s, in relative frequency of this modern command: "in books, Hollywood films, commercials, and daily conversations, we advise, even order: be yourself!"&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==Cultural activities==
Due to different groups' and individual's different experiences, views of authenticity regarding cultural activities vary widely and often differ between groups and individuals.&lt;ref&gt;AJ Giannini (2010). "Semiotic and semantic implications of "authenticity"". ''Psychological Reports'' '''106''' (2): 611–612.&lt;/ref&gt; For Sartre, [[jazz]] music was a representation of freedom; this may have been in part because jazz was associated with [[African American]] culture, and was thus in opposition to Western culture generally, which Sartre considered hopelessly inauthentic. [[Theodor Adorno]], however, another writer and philosopher concerned with the notion of authenticity, despised jazz music because he saw it as a false representation that could give the appearance of authenticity but that was as much bound up in concerns with appearance and audience as many other forms of art. Heidegger in his later life associated authenticity with non-technological modes of existence, seeing technology as distorting a more "authentic" relationship with the natural world.

Some writers on authenticity in the twentieth century considered the predominant [[Norm (social)|cultural norms]] to be inauthentic; not only because they were seen as forced on people, but also because, in themselves, they required people to behave inauthentically towards their own desires, obscuring true reasons for acting. [[Advertising]], in as much as it attempted to give people a reason for doing something that they did not already possess, was a "textbook" example of how Western culture distorted the individual for external reasons. Race relations are seen as another limit on authenticity, as they demand that the self engage with others on the basis of external attributes. An early example of the connection between inauthenticity and capitalism was made by [[Karl Marx]], whose notion of "[[Marx's theory of alienation|alienation]]" can be linked to the later discourse on the nature of inauthenticity.

Individuals concerned with living authentically have often led unusual lives that opposed cultural norms; the rise of the [[counter-culture]] in the 1960s in Europe and America was seen by many as a new opportunity to live an authentic existence. Many, however, have pointed out that [[anti-authoritarianism]] and eccentricity does not necessarily constitute an authentic state of being. The connection of the violation of cultural norms to authenticity, however, is strong and real{{Citation needed|date=October 2010}}, and continues today: among artists who explicitly violate the conventions of their profession, for example. The connection of inauthenticity to [[capitalism]] is contained in the notion of "[[selling out]]," used to describe an artist whose work has become inauthentic after achieving commercial success and thus becoming to an extent integrated into an inauthentic system.

Australian author [[Helen Demidenko]]'s novel ''The Hand that Signed the Paper'' promoted much debate on the nature of identity, ethnicity, and authenticity in Australian literature. The novel is about a Ukrainian family trying to survive a decade of [[Stalinist purges]] and state-imposed poverty and famine. When the media discovered Helen Dale's identity and legal name, this created debate in Australia's literary community.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|first=Susanna|last=Egan|title=The Company She Keeps: Demidenko and the problems of imposture in autobiography|journal=Australian Literary Studies|date=October 2004|url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_hb6396/is_4_21/ai_n29152127/|accessdate= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|first=Ken|last=Stewart|title=Those infernal pictures: reading Helen Darville, her novel and her critics|journal=Australian Literary Studies|date=May 1997|url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_hb6396/is_n1_v18/ai_n28692326/?tag=content;col1|accessdate= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===In music===
{{See also|Rockism|Punk ideologies}}

The concept of authenticity is often raised in the [[punk rock]] and [[Heavy metal music|heavy metal]] musical subcultures, in which people or bands are criticized for their purported lack of authenticity by being labeled with the epithet "[[poseur]]".&lt;ref name="indiecult2006"/&gt; "Poseur" is used to refer to a person (or band) who copies the dress, speech, and/or mannerisms of a group or subculture, generally for attaining acceptability within the group, yet who is deemed not to share or understand the values or philosophy of the subculture. "The code of authenticity, which is central to the [[heavy metal subculture]], is demonstrated in many ways", such as through clothing, the use of an emotional singing voice and having serious themes in the songs.&lt;ref&gt;Weinstein, Deena. ''Heavy Metal:The Music and its Subculture." Da Capo Press, 2009. p. 46&lt;/ref&gt; In metal, one study of how fans sought out authenticity within the metal scene noted three elements to authenticity: long-term dedication to the scene; knowing key events of metal culture; and making the right choices based on one's authentic inner voice.&lt;ref&gt;Larsson, Susanna. "I Bang My Head, Therefore I Am: Constructing Individual and Social Authenticity in the Heavy Metal Subculture" in ''Young.'' 21 (1). 2013. p. 95-110&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Black metal]], an [[extreme metal]] genre, sincerity, authenticity and extremity are valued above all else."{{sfn|Olson|2008|p=47}} In the metal and hardcore punk subcultures, a band that began from a working class milieu that later signs to a major record label for a lucrative recording contract may be deemed to have "[[sell out|sold out]]" and lost their authenticity. In addition to the focus on authenticity in "...punk, [[house music|house]], grunge, garage, and hip-hop," ideas of authenticity have seeped into many other genres, including those considered by some to be less "authentic" than the aforementioned.&lt;ref name="autogenerated2007"/&gt;

'''Biblical literalist chronology''' is the attempt to correlate the theological dates used in the Bible with the real chronology of actual events.{{sfn|Barr|2001|p=96}} The Bible measures time from the date of [[Genesis creation narrative|Creation]] (years are measured as [[anno mundi]], or AM, meaning Year of the World), but there is no agreement on when this was, some of the better-known alternatives including Archbishop [[Ussher chronology|James Ussher]], who placed it in 4004 BCE, [[Isaac Newton]] in 4000 BCE, [[Martin Luther]] in 3961 BCE, the traditional Jewish date of 3760 BCE, and the traditional Greek Orthodox date, based on the [[Septuagint]], of 5009 BCE.{{sfn|Day|2014|p=3-4}} To the foundation of the Temple of Solomon the passage of time is measured by simple addition of from the Creation; for later periods it measures time by the reigns of kings, but the data is conflicting and there is no agreement on how to resolve the problems.{{sfn|Barr|2001|p=96}}{{sfn|Konkel|2010|p=673}} 

== Background ==
The Jewish Bible (the Christian [[Old Testament]]) dates events either by simple arithmetic taking the [[Genesis creation narrative|creation of the world]] as the starting point, or, in the later books, by correlations between the reigns of kings in Israel and Judah.{{sfn|Barr|2001|p=96}} The data it provides falls into three periods:{{sfn|Barr|2001|p=96-97}}
# From the Creation to Abraham's migration to Canaan, during which events are dated by adding the ages of the patriarchs;
# From Abraham's migration to the foundation of Solomon's temple, in which the chronology in Genesis continues to be arrived at by adding ages, but from Exodus on is usually given in statements;
# From the foundation of the temple onward, which gives the reigns in years (sometimes shorter periods) of kings in Israel and Judah.
 
For the biblical authors the chronology was theological in intent, functioning as prophecy and not as history.{{sfn|Christensen|1990|p=148}}{{sfn|Thompson|2007|p=73-74}} [[Biblical literalism]], however, does not treat it this way, because literalists have a profound respect for the Bible as the word of God.{{sfn|Olson|2011|p=22}} This way of thinking had its origins in [[Christian fundamentalism]], an early 20th century movement which opposed then-current non-supernatural interpretations of the life of Jesus by stressing, among other things, the verbal inspiration of scripture.{{sfn|Wood|2005|p=28}} The underlying concept, or fear, was that if everything in the Bible were not true, everything would collapse.{{sfn|Wood|2005|p=28}}

==Literalist chronologies==
The creation of a literalist chronology of the Bible faces several hurdles, of which the following are the most significant:
* There are different texts of the Jewish Bible, the major text-families being: the [[Septuagint]], a Greek translation of the original Hebrew scriptures made in the last few centuries before Christ; the [[Masoretic text]], a version of the Hebrew text curated by the Jewish rabbis but the earliest manuscripts of which date from the early years of the 2nd millennium CE; and the Samaritan text, restricted to the five books of the Torah plus the Book of Joshua. The three differ quite markedly from each other.{{sfn|Northcote|2004|p=1}}
* Literalists prefer the Masoretic text, on which Protestant Bibles are based, but the Masoretic text sometimes contains absurdities, as when it states that Saul came to the throne at the age of one and reigned for two years. Such obvious errors can be corrected by reference to other versions of the Bible (in this case the Septuagint, which gives more realistic numbers), but their existence calls into question the fundamentalist idea that the MT text is the inspired word of God.{{sfn|Vriezen|van der Woude|2005|p=98}} Most fundamentalists, with the notable exception of the [[King James Only]] movement, avoid this by holding that only the authors of the original autographs (the very first copies written by [[Mosaic authorship|Moses]] and others) were inspired by God.{{sfn|Whelan|2012|p=unpaginated}}
* The Bible is not always consistent.{{sfn|Greenspahn|2016|p=380}} For example, Exodus 12:30 states that the Israelites spent 430 years in Egypt, while Paul in the New Testament says the 430 years covers the period from Abraham to Moses.{{sfn|Barr|2001|p=97}}
* The earlier part of the Bible's history contradicts science and known history (the world is not 6,000 years old as the Biblical chronology suggests, the ages of the patriarchs in Genesis are far longer than is reasonable, and serious historians of Israel's history no longer regard the exodus, the conquest of Canaan, or the entire period prior to David as real history).
* Very few events in the Bible are mentioned in outside sources, making it difficult to move from a relative chronology (X happened before Y happened) to an absolute one (X happened in a known year).

==Tables==
The Bible measures events from the year of God's creation of the world, a type of calendar called [[Anno Mundi]] ("Year of the World"), shortened as AM. The task of a literal biblical chronology is to convert this to dates in the modern chronology expressed as years before or after Christ, BC and AD. There have been many attempts to do this, none of them universally accepted. The following tables (derived from Thomas L. Thompson, ''The Mythic Past''; notes within the table as cited) divide the Bible's AM dates by the three periods into which they most naturally fall.{{sfn|Thompson|2007|p=75}}

| style="text-align:left;"|Entrance into Egypt&lt;br&gt;Exodus&lt;br&gt;Foundation of Solomon's Temple
| style="text-align:left;"|The 215 years between Abraham's call to enter Canaan (AM 2021) and Jacob's entry into Egypt (AM 2236) are calculated from the ages of Abraham, Isaac and Jacob provided in Genesis; the 430 year period in Egypt is stated in Exodus 12:40, although [[Paul the Apostle|St. Paul]] in the New Testament says that the 430 years covers the entire period from Abraham to the exodus.{{sfn|Barr|2001|p=97}} The Exodus (AM 2666) occurs exactly two-thirds of the way through the 4,000 years from the Creation to the rededication of the Temple in 164 BCE, marking it as the pivotal event of the chronology.{{sfn|Thompson|2007|p=74}} It is also two-thirds of the way through the 40 notional "generations" of 100 years each making up the 4,000 years, with Aaron, the first High Priest, being the 26th generation from Adam.{{sfn|Johnson|2002|p=32}}&lt;br&gt;
A literal reading of the Biblical chronology would place the Exodus about 1446 BCE, on the basis of the statement in 1 Kings 6:1 that the Temple was founded 480 years after the Exodus.{{sfn|Reed|2011|p=107}} From this a literal chronology can deduce dates for the entry into Canaan 40 years later and the birth of Moses 80 years earlier. It seems impossible, however, to reconcile the 430 years in Egypt with the Bible's information (Exodus 12:40) that this involved only four generations.{{sfn|Davies|2008|p=28}}

| The period from the foundation of the Temple to its destruction, 430 years, is found by adding the reigns of the kings of Judah from the fourth year of Solomon (the year of the Temple's foundation).{{sfn|Barr|2001|p=97}} The fourth year of Solomon came exactly 1,200 years after the birth of Abraham (Abraham was born in AM 1946 if the two years of the Flood are excluded),{{sfn|Davies|2008|p=30}} and there were exactly 20 kings in both Judah and Israel following Solomon, despite Judah lasting more than a century longer than Israel.{{sfn|Davies|2008|p=26-27}} The complete chronology seems to point towards the re-dedication of the Temple by the Maccabees in 164 BCE bringing the chronology to AM 4000, from which the entire cycle is calculated backwards.{{sfn|Thompson|2007|p=74}}{{sfn|Blenkinsopp|2006|p=87}}&lt;br&gt;

The chronology of the monarchy, unlike that of earlier periods, can be checked against non-Biblical sources and seems to be correct in general terms.{{sfn|Lemche|2010|p=95-96}} This raises the prospect that the [[Books of Kings]] can be used to reconstruct a chronology for the monarchy, but the task has in fact proven intractably difficult.{{sfn|Tetley|2005|p=2}} The problem is that the books contain numerous contradictions: to take just one example, since Rehoboam of Judah and Jeroboam of Israel began to rule at the same time (1 Kings 12), and since Ahaziah of Judah and Joram of Israel were killed at the same time (1 Kings 9:24, 27), the same amount of time should have elapsed in both kingdoms, but the count shows 95 years passing in Judah and 98 in Israel.{{sfn|Galil|1996|p=12}} In short, "[t]he data concerning the synchronisms appeared in hopeless contradiction with the data as to the lengths of reigns."{{sfn|Thiele|1983|p=15}} Possibly the most widely followed attempt to resolve the problems is [[Edwin R. Thiele]]'s ''[[The Mysterious Numbers of the Hebrew Kings]]'' (three editions between 1951 and 1983), but his work has been widely criticised for, among other things, introducing "innumerable" co-regencies, constructing a "complex system of calendars", and using "unique" patterns of calculation; as a result his following is largely among scholars "committed ... to a doctrine of scripture's absolute harmony" (the criticism is to be found in [[Brevard Childs]]' ''Introduction to the Old Testament as Scripture'').{{sfn|Tetley|2005|p=4 and fn.6}} Subsequent scholars continue to propose alternative chronologies, but, in the words of a recent commentary on Kings, there is "little consensus on acceptable methods of dealing with conflicting data."{{sfn|Konkel|2010|p=673}}&lt;br&gt;

== Example of literalist chronology ==

The following tabulation of years and dates is according to the literal letter of the text of the Bible alone. Links to multiple translations and versions are provided for verification. For comparison, known historically dated events are associated with the resultant literal dates. Dates according to the famous [[Ussher chronology]] appear in small type italics "''{{small|A.M.}}''" (Latin: "''Year of the World''"), "''{{small|Ante C.}}''" (Latin: "''Before Christ''"). In ancient Israel a part year was designated as the previous king's last year and the new king's 1st year. The arithmetic can be checked by starting at the bottom of the table with the date of the destruction of the Temple in 587 and adding the number of years in the Scriptures (books of the ''Prophets'' and ''Chronicles'' through ''Genesis'') back up to the beginning. Dates with ''events in italics'' appearing in ''{{small|small type}}'' for historical comparison are according to Bernard Grun's ''The Timetables of History''. For the period after 587 BCE known historical dates are used as referents. Biblical source texts for stated numbers of years are referenced and linked. Reference sources are the [[Revised Standard Version Catholic Edition|RSVCE]],&lt;ref&gt;''Revised Standard Version'', © 1966 Division of Christian Education of the National Council of the Churches of Christ in the United States of America, published by Thomas Nelson Publishers for Ignatius Press, {{ISBN|0-89870-490-1}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[New American Bible]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | title = Saint Joseph Edition of The New American Bible | publisher = [[Catholic Book Publishing|Catholic Book Publishing Co.]], New York, N.Y. | year = 1987, 1980, 1970 by the [[Confraternity of Christian Doctrine]], Washington, D.C.}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''The Timetables of History'' by [[Bernard Grun]], and the ''Holman Illustrated Bible Dictionary'' (2003).

|The [[Book of Joshua|conquest of Canaan]], a period of 32 (?) years, beginning with [[Jericho]] (1536). &lt;br/&gt; The Bible does not state the number of the years of the conquest of Canaan during the lifetime of Joshua, only that Joshua was 110 years old when he died.
*''See'' [[Ai (Bible)|Ai]] and [[Tel Hazor|Hazor]] &lt;br/&gt; [[John Garstang]] and [[Kathleen Kenyon]]&lt;ref group=note&gt;According to [[carbon-dating]], Jericho (Jericho City IV) was destroyed between 1617 and 1530 BCE. The site remained uninhabited (Joshua's curse ? {{bibleverse-nb||Joshua|6:26}}) until the city was refounded in the 9th century BCE. John Garstang determined that Jericho was destroyed by fire around 1400 BCE, corresponding to the biblical dating of the Israelite conquest current at that time. Kathleen Kenyon's findings disagreed with Garstang and the accepted biblical dating, and she dated the destruction and the city wall to a much earlier time, in the 1600–1500s, c. 1550. But she believed that the Exodus and the conquest under Joshua took place in the 1200s and declared that, since the city had already been long uninhabited through the entire 13th century, it was impossible that Jericho had been destroyed by Joshua according to the biblical account. "While critical scholars underline the conflict between archaeological data and the biblical conquest narrative, in reality there is no conflict here."—Karen Joines and Eric Mitchell. &lt;br/&gt; —''Source'': "Jericho", Karen Joines and Eric Mitchell, ''Holman Illustrated Bible Dictionary'', pp. 885–888. &lt;br/&gt; Israeli-Canadian journalist [[Simcha Jacobovici]]  (''[[The Exodus Decoded]]'', 2006) pointed out that if researchers of the future insisted that the American Civil War took place at the time of the Civil Rights Movement in the United States in the 1960s at the time of the Vietnam War, and then looked for evidence supporting occurrence of the Civil War at that time, they would find none, and the presidency of Abraham Lincoln would be regarded as only legendary. If chronological dating provided by a more literal reading of the ''[[Tanakh]]'' were taken seriously, then concrete archaeological evidence for the historical accuracy of the biblical text would become more evident: "It's staring them in the face, and they don't recognize it."&lt;/ref&gt;

|"''...the people served the LORD...all the days of the elders who outlived Joshua...and there arose a generation after them, who did not know the LORD....''"
*A plain, explicit meaning for the exact period of "''the days of the elders''" and of the "''generation after them''" cannot be drawn from the text of the Bible alone; the Bible text does not explicitly state the number of days of that generation. &lt;br/&gt; The "''300 years''" of Judges 11:26 is not useful here in determining the period of that generation and does not correspond to the literal numbering of the years stated plainly in all the chronological texts of the Bible tabulated from David back to Joshua, from ''2 Samuel'' through ''Joshua'' (Jephthah 1186 BCE back to Cushan-Rishathaim 1505 BCE: 1505–1186 BCE = 319 years). &lt;br/&gt; The "''450 years''" of Acts 13:19-20 for the period of the judges exactly corresponds to the literal tabulation of the years in this table, from 1505 BCE, after Joshua, to 1055 BCE, when David began to rule over all Israel and Judah (1505 – 1055 = 450), but it does not correspond to the literal tabulation of the years of the "''judges until Samuel the prophet''" 1115/1075 BCE. (1505–1115 BCE = 390 years, and 1505–1075 BCE = 430 years.) This text too is not useful in determining the number of days and length of years of the 2 generations after Joshua.

This is not explicitly stated in the [[Book of Judges]], which "plainly" relates their exploits solely as a ''sequential'' series of events, so that taking the texts literally, without recourse to the method of grammatico-historical exegesis, confronts uninstructed readers of the Bible with what appears to them to be an impossible inconsistency which can be unsettling.

::{{small|The Bible does not say that Nebuchadnezzar released Jehoiakim during or after his 3rd year to allow him to return to Jerusalem and then took him away a second time to Babylon in his 11th year—such a conclusion, however reasonable, is speculative only and cannot be drawn solely from a plain reading of the strict letter of the text of the Bible alone according to the method of letterism, which only presents an apparent inconsistency, but which entirely accords with the grammatico-historical method of exegesis which [[A priori and a posteriori|''a priori'' presumptively]] takes both texts as reliable, consistent and historically factual, and as such, provides an illustrative example of the difference in the two literalist methodologies.}} See [[Inference]].

"''between the sea and the glorious holy mountain...he shall come to his end with none to help him.''"—"''...among the mountains in a strange land.''" A majority of Biblical scholars maintain that Daniel wrongly prophesied that Antiochus would die in Palestine.]]Daniel's prophesy of the death of Antiochus IV Epiphanes "''among the mountains in a strange land''" ({{bibleverse|2|Maccabees|9:28|63}}; {{bibleverse||Daniel|11:44-45|ESV}}) is [[Controversy|controverted]]. Daniel 11:45 does not specify which "''sea''". Some students of the Bible [{{small|source: "Daniel", S. Miller, ''Holman Illustrated Bible Dictionary''}}] identify Antiochus literally with Daniel 11:21-44, which accords with the description of his policies and actions in 1 and 2 Maccabees. 1 Maccabees 6:1-16 and 2 Maccabees 9:1-16, 28 shows that Antiochus died travelling on the [[Silk Road|great east-west highway]] running through Persia, northeast of Judea and [[Mount Zion]] and southwest of the southern shores of the [[Caspian Sea]], in the mountainous Zagros region of Persia between [[Ecbatana]] and Babylon. It is evident that he did not die in Palestine between Mount Zion and the [[Mediterranean Sea]]. Traditionally, "''the sea''" and "''the great sea''" in the Bible is the Mediterranean ({{bibleverse||Joshua|1:4|ESV}}; {{bibleverse-nb||Joshua|9:1|ESV}}; {{bibleverse-nb||Joshua|15:12|ESV}} and {{bibleverse-nb||Joshua|15:47|ESV}}; {{bibleverse-nb||Joshua|23:4|ESV}};{{bibleverse||Isaiah|11:11|ESV}}; {{bibleverse||Jeremiah|25:19-22|ESV}}; {{bibleverse||Ezekiel|47:19|ESV}};{{bibleverse||Daniel|7:2-3|ESV}}; compare {{bibleverse||Joel|2:20|ESV}} "''eastern sea''" and "''western sea''", and {{bibleverse||Micah|7:12|ESV}} "''from sea to sea''"). This is the understanding of a majority of Old Testament Biblical scholars such as [[Choon-Leong Seow|C. L. Seow]] [{{small|''Daniel'', 2003, [[Westminster John Knox Press]], Louisville, Kentucky, ISBN 978-0-664-25675-3}}], and [[John J. Collins]], Peter W. Flint, and others [{{small|''[http://www.brill.com/book-daniel-volume-1-composition-and-reception The Book of Daniel: Volume 1 Composition and Reception]'', 2000, BRILL, ISBN 978-90-04-11675-7}}] who hold that Daniel 11:45 refers to the mountains of Judea between Mount Zion and the Mediterranean Sea, or more specifically to Mount Zion, and conclude that the prophesy that Antiochus would die in Palestine "is totally inaccurate" since he died in Persia. Bible translations of this passage differ: some have Antiochus pitching his pavilion "''between the seas''", others have it "''on the glorious holy mountain''", while others more literally have it "''between the glorious holy mountain and the sea''" (see variant translations at {{bibleverse||Daniel|11:44-45}}). The conclusion of most Old Testament scholars is that the account in Daniel 11 is completely accurate through verse 44, but wrong in verse 45, and therefore it must have been completed near the end of the reign of Antiochus but before his death in December 164, or at least before news of it reached Jerusalem. But this scholarly reading of "''the sea''" as the Mediterranean, and those translations having Antiochus' pavilion "''on/in the glorious holy mountain (Zion)''" in Palestine, are simply dismissed as wrong by a literalist plain reading of the Biblical text ([[Context (language use)|context]]) as it relates to the death of Antiochus among the mountains of Persia "''in a strange land''" between the Caspian Sea and Mount Zion. —''Sources'': &lt;br/&gt; "Mediterranean Sea", Philip Lee, ''Holman Illustrated Bible Dictionary'', pp. 1097–1098. &lt;br/&gt;"Daniel, book of", Stephen R.

*2 Maccabees 1:13-16 relates the death of [[Antiochus X Eusebes]] and his men, during the course of a military expedition, as locked inside the temple of [[Nanaya|Nanea]] in Persia, stoned to death and beheaded by the priests.&lt;ref group=note&gt;[[Mahlon H. Smith]] states that Antiochus X Eusebes died fighting the [[Parthian Empire]] (which included Persian territory). See [http://virtualreligion.net/iho/antiochus_10.html Antiochus X Eusebes: ''Mahlon H. Smith''].&lt;/ref&gt; ({{small|This Antiochus should not be confused with the earlier Antiochus IV Epiphanes, who failed to take Elymais and its temple, and afterward died of parasitic infection and decay in the mountains of Persia. 1 Maccabees 6:1-16; 2 Maccabees 9:1-10, 28.}}&lt;ref group=note&gt;Some scholars (''The New American Bible'' for example) believe that the ''Antiochus'' referred to in this text of 2 Macc. 1:14 was Antiochus IV Epiphanes: "'''''1, 14-17''': A different account of the death of Antiochus IV is given in 2 Mc 9, 1-29 and another variant account in 1 Mc 6, 1-16. The writer of this letter'' [2 Macc. 1:10–2:18 one copy to Aristobulus in Jerusalem, one copy to the Jews in Egypt] ''probably heard a distorted rumor of the king's death. This fact and other indications show that the letter was written very soon after Antiochus IV died, hence in 164 B.C.'' —New American Bible, 2 Maccabees 1:14–17, footnote. &lt;br/&gt; As with the text of Daniel 11:45, a literalist interpretation of 2 Maccabees rejects the scholarly view of a "''distorted rumor''" in favor of an "inerrant" reading that takes the narrative as an accurate report, and therefore as not referring to the death of Antiochus IV Epiphanes, but to the actual death of another Antiochus who was slain by Parthians in the (Syrian) region of [[Parthian Empire#Rome and Armenia|Persia/the Parthian Empire]] in the temple of Nanaya. The extra-biblical evidence cited by Mahlon H. Smith and others regarding the circumstances of the death of Antiochus X tends to support this literalist view, but this is currently a minority opinion.&lt;/ref&gt;)

'''Biomusic''' is a form of [[experimental music]] which deals with [[Natural sounds|sounds created or performed by non-humans]]. The definition is also sometimes extended to include sounds made by humans in a directly biological way. For instance, music that is created by the brain waves of the composer can also be called biomusic as can music created by the human body without the use of tools or instruments that are not part of the body ([[singing]] or vocalizing is usually excluded from this definition).

Biomusic can be divided into two basic categories: music that is created solely by the animal (or in some cases plant), and music which is based upon animal noises but which is arranged by a human composer.  Some forms of music use recorded sounds of nature as part of the music, for example [[new-age music]] uses the nature sounds as backgrounds for various musical [[soundscape]]s, and [[ambient music]] sometimes uses nature sounds modified with reverbs and delay units to make spacey versions of the nature sounds as part of the ambience.

==Forms==

===Bird song and/or biophonies in music===

The incorporation of [[bird song]] in music is one of the most widely studied forms of biomusic. Notable in this regard is the French composer [[Olivier Messiaen]] who began incorporating accurately transcribed bird songs into his music in 1952. One obstacle facing the use of bird songs in music is their complexity and usually very high register. Nevertheless, Messiaen included a variety of bird songs in many of his mature works including his ''[[Catalogue d'oiseaux]]'' ("Birds catalogue"), piano (1956–58) which incorporated songs from thirteen different birds. Also, he incorporated the themes of many birds in his orchestral piece, "''Chronochromie''".

In Western music, recordings of bird songs have also been used in numerous works. The first one is ''[[Pines of Rome]]'' (1924) by [[Ottorino Respighi]] (the third movement includes the sound of a [[nightingale]] recorded onto a phonograph, played in the concert hall during the movement's ending. This was something that had never been done before, and created discussion). A famous one is ''[[Cantus Arcticus]]'' (1972) by the Finnish composer [[Einojuhani Rautavaara]]. Subtitled ''Concerto for Birds and Orchestra'' this piece incorporates tape recordings of birdsong recorded near the Arctic Circle and on the bogs of Liminka in northern Finland.

A nightingale can be heard on [[Pink Floyd]]'s "[[Cirrus Minor (song)|Cirrus Minor]]" (''[[More (soundtrack)|More]]'', 1969) or "[[Grantchester Meadows (song)|Grantchester Meadows]]" (''[[Ummagumma]]'', 1969), a sample of tweeting birds on [[Laurie Anderson]]'s  "[[O Superman]]" (1981), [[seagull]]s within [[concept album]] ''[[L'Opéra du pauvre]]'' (1983) by French singer-songwriter [[Léo Ferré]]. The entire [[biophony]] of a [[soundscape]] can be heard on the [[Beaver &amp; Krause]] 1968 Warner Brothers album (released in 1970), "''In a Wild Sanctuary''", the first album on the theme of [[ecology]] and the first album to incorporate entire natural soundscapes as components of the orchestration. This work anticipated by 44 years, the 2014 Cheltenham Music Festival (UK) premier of "''The Great Animal Orchestra Symphony for Orchestra and Wild Soundscapes''," composed by [[Bernie Krause]] and Oxford (Balliol College) former composer-in-residence, [[Richard Blackford]], performed by the BBC National Orchestra of Wales. This, too, features the first symphony based on ecological themes and the first to perform, live, with whole natural soundscapes informing the orchestral form and themes, just as biophonies and geophonies inspired music (rhythm, melody, organization of sound, timbre, and dynamic) at the dawn of cultural time.

Commissioned by the [[Alonzo King LINES Ballet]], an international corps based in San Francisco, the score for ''Biophony,'' composed by Bernie Krause and Richard Blackford, consists almost entirely of biophonies and geophonies and premiered in 2015. It has been performed worldwide, since.

It is important to note that of the more than 13,100 bird species, less than 100 have been accepted into Western classical or other music genres (or .007%). With the exception of entire biophonies, the abstract and deconstructed selection of particular birds (and the voices of a few other non-human animals such as certain cetaceans or canids) in these genres have been largely predicated on the convenient ways in which they happen to fit the models consistent with the then-current paradigms of the Academy – those considered to be "musical" at any given time.&lt;ref&gt;The Great Animal Orchestra: Finding the Origins of Music in the World's Wild Places, by Bernie Krause (Little Brown, 2012)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Whale song in music===

Recorded [[whale song]] also frequently inspired [[20th century experimental music]]. One example is in [[George Crumb|George Crumb’s]] ''[[Vox Balaenae]]'' (Voice of the Whale), a composition for electric flute, electric cello, and amplified piano.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.georgecrumb.net/comp/voice-p.html Vox Balaenae (Voice of the Whale)] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080511212137/http://www.georgecrumb.net/comp/voice-p.html |date=May 11, 2008 }} The official George Crumb home page (Retrieved 10 October 2007)&lt;/ref&gt; However, as Vox Balaenae does not include actual recorded whale songs, it is not a pure biomusic composition. Another similar piece that could be considered true biomusic is ''[[And God Created Great Whales]]'', a piece written in 1970 by American composer [[Alan Hovhaness]]. This work for orchestra and whale songs brings the recorded sounds of [[humpback whale|humpback]], [[bowhead whale|bowhead]], and [[orca|killer]] [[whales]] directly into the concert hall.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.artistdirect.com/nad/store/artist/album/0,,197507,00.html And God Created Great Whales (1970) for Orchestra and Whale Songs] Artist direct (Retrieved 10 October 2007)&lt;/ref&gt; The song "[[Il n'y a plus rien]]", from French singer-songwriter [[Léo Ferré]]'s eponymous album (1973), begins and ends with recorded whale songs mixed with a symphonic orchestra. Another piece utilizing recorded whale song is the ''Earth Mass (Missa Gaia)'' by [[Paul Winter]] (1982) which is performed at the Episcopal Church of St. John the Divine each year to celebrate the Feast of St. Francis. One of the movements uses a four note motive derived from a recorded humpback whale song that opens and closes that segment of the work.

===Neurofeedback===

Music created by [[neurofeedback]] relies on the brainwaves of a human subject to create music. An [[Electroencephalophone]] (a musical instrument that converts brain waves to sound) was first designed by [[Erkki Kurenniemi]] in the 1960s. American composer [[David Rosenboom]] further pioneered work with [[neurofeedback]] music as has [[Brazil]]ian [[composer]] [[Eduardo Reck Miranda]]. Neurofeedback composition is still in development, and though it is widely experimented with, it is still very uncommon to see it performed.

===Cybernetic biomusic===

In 1975, [[Grateful Dead]] associate [[Ned Lagin]] released an album of experimental [[space music]] entitled ''Seastones'' on Round Records; he described the recording as ''"cybernetic biomusic"'', emphasizing the use of computers and synthesizers to create organic-impressionistic sounds and meditative feelings.  The album was one of the first commercially released recordings to feature digital computers and the [[Don Buchla|Buchla]] digital-polyphonic synthesizer.&lt;ref name="prendergast244"&gt;{{cite book |last=Prendrergast |first=Mark |year=2000|title=The Ambient Century: From Mahler to Trance - the Evolution of Sound in the Electronic Age|publisher=Bloomsbury Publishing|pages= 244 |isbn=1-58234-134-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From 2004 to 2007, [[Pete Townshend]] collaborated with composer [[Lawrence Ball]] and programmer Dave Snowdon to set up a project called [[The Lifehouse Method]], an Internet site where applicants could "sit" for an electronic musical portrait made up from data they entered into the website.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.billboard.com/articles/news/1052567/townshends-method-finally-ready-for-unveiling|title=Townshend's Method|accessdate=13 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;  On 23 April 2007, Ball released a double album on [[iTunes]] called ''Method Music - Imaginary Sitters, Imaginary Galaxies'' which is part of Pete Townshend's Lifehouse Method music project.

===Other examples===

Biomusic can take many other forms. These can include the simple amplification of animal sounds, or the creation of music through the fluctuation of electric current in plants. More unusual still is the use of animal notation: [[Sheet music|music scores]] created by animals, often in the form of paw prints. Biomusic can also take the form of animals trained to perform specific behaviors as part of a musical performance (birds trained to sing for instance).

''[[Music from The Body]]'' is the biomusic [[soundtrack album]] to Roy Battersby's 1970 documentary film ''The Body'', about [[human biology]], narrated by [[Vanessa Redgrave]] and [[Frank Finlay]]. The music was composed and performed in collaboration between [[Pink Floyd]] member [[Roger Waters]] and [[Ron Geesin]], and uses sounds made by the human body (slaps, breathing, laughing, whispering, farts, etc.) in addition to more traditional guitar, piano and stringed instruments.

The experimental ambient/noise group [[Tribes of Neurot]] released an album titled "Adaptation and Survival: The Insect Project" in 2002; a multidirectional sound experiment in which all sounds were originally produced by insects and then manipulated and synthesized.

A collaboration album between [[Breakcore]] artists [[Venetian Snares]] and [[Hecate]] entitled [[Nymphomatriarch]] was composed entirely from sounds of the two performing various sexual activities together, which were distorted and time-stretched to resemble typical [[Breakcore]] samples.

[http://www.translatingnature.org/lake/ The Lake], by artist [[Julie Freeman]] tracked natural biological motion via electronic tagging systems, and transformed the data collected into musical composition and animation.

Musicians [[Caninus (band)|Caninus]], [[Hatebeak]] and [[Lil B]]&lt;ref&gt;http://pitchfork.com/news/48656-lil-bs-cat-keke-the-adopted-tabby-drops-track/&lt;/ref&gt; have used animals as [[Lead vocalist|lead]] or [[backing vocalist]]s.

The '''Census of Marine Life''' was a 10-year, US $650 million scientific initiative, involving a global network of researchers in more than 80 nations, engaged to assess and explain the [[Biodiversity|diversity]], distribution, and abundance of [[Marine life|life in the oceans]]. The world's first comprehensive Census of Marine Life &amp;mdash; past, present, and future &amp;mdash; was released in 2010 in [[London]].&lt;ref name="Census-2010_Public_News_Release"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.coml.org/pressreleases/census2010/PDF/Census-2010_Public_News_Release.pdf |title=2010 Census of Marine Life News Release, 23 September 2010 |publisher=coml.org |date= 23 September 2010|accessdate=2018-07-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; Initially supported by funding from the [[Alfred P. Sloan Foundation]], the project was successful in generating many times that initial investment in additional support and substantially increased the baselines of knowledge in often underexplored ocean realms, as well as engaging over 2,700 different researchers for the first time in a global collaborative community united in a common goal, and has been described as "one of the largest scientific collaborations ever conducted".

==Project history==
According to [[Jesse H. Ausubel|Jesse Ausubel]], Senior Research Associate of the Program for the Human Environment of [[Rockefeller University]] and  science advisor to the [[Alfred P. Sloan Foundation]], the idea for a "Census of Marine Life" originated in conversations between himself and Dr. [[J. Frederick Grassle]], an oceanographer and benthic ecology professor at [[Rutgers University]], in 1996.&lt;ref&gt;[https://phe.rockefeller.edu/docs/Image%20Census.pdf Entwisle, Amy. 2011. "What Lies Beneath" Interview with Jesse Ausubel, Co-Founder, Census of Marine Life. Imagine Magazine, Johns Hopkins Center for Talented Youth, January 2011; retrieved from phe.rockefeller.edu website (July 25 2018)]&lt;/ref&gt; Grassle had been urged to talk with Ausubel by former colleagues at the [[Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution]] and was at that time unaware that Ausubel was also a program manager at the Alfred P. Sloan Foundation, funders of a number of other large scale "public good" science-based projects such as the [[Sloan Digital Sky Survey]].&lt;ref&gt;Grassle, Fred. 2010. Introduction. Pp. ix-xi in McIntyre, Alistair D. (editor). Life in the World's Oceans: Diversity, Distribution, and Abundance. chapter available at http://comlmaps.org/mcintyre/forward/introduction-fred-grassel&lt;/ref&gt; Ausubel was instrumental in persuading the Foundation to fund a series of "feasibility workshops" over the period 1997-1998 into how the project might be conducted,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.comlsecretariat.org/reports-other-documents/feasibility-workshops/ Census of Marine Life: Feasibility workshops. Census of Marine Life website (retrieved 25 July 2018)]&lt;/ref&gt; one result of these workshops being the broadening of the initial concept from a "Census of the Fishes" into a comprehensive "Census of Marine Life".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.comlsecretariat.org/wp-content/uploads/2010/06/Census-of-the-Fishes_Update-1999.pdf Ausubel, Jesse H. 1999. "The Census of the Fishes: An Update." Draft document available from Census of Marine Life website (retrieved 25 July 2018)]&lt;/ref&gt; Results from these workshops, plus associated invited contributions, formed the basis of a special issue of ''Oceanography'' magazine in 1999;&lt;ref&gt;[http://tos.org/oceanography/issue/volume-12-issue-03 Oceanography Vol. 12, No. 3, Special Issue: Census of Marine Life]&lt;/ref&gt; later that year, a workshop in [[Washington, D.C.]] addressed the formation of an [[Ocean Biogeographic Information System]] (OBIS) which would serve to collate existing knowledge about the distribution of organisms in the ocean and form the information management component of the Census.&lt;ref&gt;[https://tos.org/oceanography/assets/docs/13-3_grassle.pdf Grassle, J.F. 2000. The Ocean Biogeographic Information System (OBIS): an on-line, worldwide atlas for accessing, modeling and mapping marine biological data in a multidimensional geographic context. ''Oceanography'' 13(3), pp. 5-7.]&lt;/ref&gt;

The Census began in a formal sense with the announcement in May 2000 of eight grants totaling about 4 million US$ to create OBIS, as reported in [[Science (journal)|''Science'']] magazine, 2 June.&lt;ref&gt;[http://go.galegroup.com/ps/anonymous?id=GALE%7CA62924795&amp;sid=googleScholar&amp;v=2.1&amp;it=r&amp;linkaccess=abs&amp;issn=00368075&amp;p=AONE&amp;sw=w Malakoff, David. 2000. "Grants Kick Off Ambitious Count of All Ocean Life." [[Science (journal)|''Science'']], vol. 288, no. 5471, p. 1575.]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="COML_Aug2001"&gt;[https://phe.rockefeller.edu/COML_Aug2001/ Ausubel, Jesse H. 2001. "The Census of Marine Life: progress and prospects." ''Fisheries'' Volume 26(7): 33-36.]&lt;/ref&gt; Meanwhile, an International Scientific Steering Committee was formed in 1999, which by 2001 envisaged "about half a dozen  pilot [field] programs" for the period 2002-2004 which, along with OBIS and another project called "History of Marine Animal Populations" (HMAP), would provide the initial activities of the Census, to be followed by an additional series of field programs in 2005-2007, culminating in an analysis and integration phase in 2008-2010.&lt;ref name="COML_Aug2001" /&gt; During the operation of the Census, an additional non-field project was added, the [[Future of Marine Animal Populations]] (FMAP), which concentrated on forecasting the future of life in the oceans using [[scientific modelling|modeling]] and [[simulation]] tools.

As a general method of working, project proposals would be debated within the Scientific Steering Committee and, if recommended for funding, a formal submission would be made to the Sloan Foundation for funding to support the Principal Investigators (PIs) and a Project Coordinator, meetings of project participants, and additional Synthesis and Education and Outreach activities.&lt;ref&gt;Penman et al., page 21.&lt;/ref&gt; Since Sloan Foundation approval was dependent on promises of contributions from additional sources, and projects were encouraged to bring additional resources on board during their operation, the Foundation funds committed were effectively leveraged many times to provide a much more substantial program than would otherwise have been possible. As core infrastructure components, the Foundation also supported the Census' International Scientific Steering Committee and Secretariat, the U.S. National Committee, and an Education and Outreach Network to lift the project's visibility and engage other nations and organizations.&lt;ref&gt;[https://sloan.org/programs/completed-programs/census-of-marine-life The Alfred P. Sloan Foundation: Completed programs: Census of Marine Life. Retrieved 26 July 2018.]&lt;/ref&gt; The Census was ultimately estimated to have cost US $650 million, of which the Sloan Foundation contributed US $75 million with the remainder supplied by a large number of participating institutions, countries, and national and international organizations in the form of both direct and in-kind contributions.&lt;ref name="Census-2010_Public_News_Release" /&gt;{{efn|The Census was the largest, but not the only commitment of Sloan funds to "big science" in that decade; from information on its website https://www.sloan.org, the Foundation also provided US $11.5 million to the [[Barcode of Life]] project, an initial grant of $2.5 million to the [[Encyclopedia of Life]], and $18 million to the ethics of Synthetic Biology. Funding to the Census may be eventually surpassed by that to the [[Sloan Digital Sky Survey]] (US $60 million to 2017, refer http://www.sciencephilanthropyalliance.org/science-philanthropy-success-story-the-sloan-foundations-25-year-partnership-with-the-sloan-digital-sky-survey/), however that program has existed over a considerably longer period (1992-current).}}

In a retrospective review in 2011, David Penman and co-authors wrote:
&lt;blockquote&gt;"The Census had its inception in a visionary leader (Grassle) who was able to convince a small group of colleagues of the need for such a project and find a like-minded individual (Ausubel) who saw the opportunity for the Sloan Foundation to take a key role in bring the Census to fruition. This was not leadership that sought out problems to solve – it identified an issue that could not be addressed through conventional national funding mechanisms and could only be approached through a large-scale collaborative endeavour. The Sloan Foundation saw the opportunity to facilitate new science that would also contribute knowledge for wide societal benefit."&lt;ref&gt;Penman et al., pages 16-17.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Census program==
The Census consisted of three major component themes organized around the questions:

#What has lived in the oceans?
#What does live in the oceans?
#What will live in the oceans?

The largest component of the Census involved investigating what currently lives in the world's oceans through 14 field projects. Each sampled the biota in one of six realms of the global oceans using a range of technologies. These projects were as follows:&lt;ref&gt;''Highlights...'', rear cover listing&lt;/ref&gt;

* Arctic Ocean: '''ArcOD''' ([[Arctic Ocean Diversity]])
* Antarctic Ocean: '''CAML''' ([[Census of Antarctic Marine Life]])
* Mid-Ocean Ridges: '''MAR-ECO''' ([[Mid-Atlantic Ridge Ecosystem Project]])
* Vents and Seeps: '''ChEss''' ([[Biogeography of Deep-Water Chemosynthetic Ecosystems]])
* Abyssal Plains: '''CeDAMar''' ([[Census of Diversity of Abyssal Marine Life]])
* Seamounts: '''CenSeam''' ([[Global Census of Marine Life on Seamounts]])
* Continental Margins: '''COMARGE''' (Continental Margin Ecosystems)
* Continental Shelves: '''POST''' ([[Pacific Ocean Shelf Tracking Project]])
* Near Shore: '''NaGISA''' ([[Natural Geography in Shore Areas]])
* Coral Reefs: '''CReefs''' ([[Census of Coral Reefs]])
* Regional Ecosystems: '''GoMA''' ([[Gulf of Maine Program]])
* Microbes: '''ICoMM''' ([[International Census of Marine Microbes]])
* Zooplankton: '''CMarZ''' ([[Census of Marine Zooplankton]])
* Top Predators: '''TOPP''' ([[Tagging of Pacific Predators]])

These field projects were complemented by the three non-field Census projects, namely HMAP, FMAP and OBIS. A series of National and Regional Implementation Committees (NRICs) was also established to progress the involvement of particular countries and regions in Census activities. Towards the end of the project, additional teams were created for education and outreach, and mapping and vizualization products, while a "synthesis" group coordinated the final outcomes (publications, etc.).

==Outcomes==
During its lifespan, the Census involved some 2,700 scientists from more 80 countries who spent 9,000 days at sea participating in more than 540 census-badged expeditions,&lt;ref&gt;''Highlights...'', p.3&lt;/ref&gt; as well as uncounted nearshore sampling events. In addition to many thousands of records of previously known species, Census scientists found more than 6,000 marine species potentially new to science and had completed formal descriptions of 1,200 of them up to 2010. Census scientists visited many parts of the global ocean to learn more about species ranging in size from the blue whale to minute zooplankton and microbes (bacteria and viruses); sampled from the world's coldest regions to the warm tropics, from deep-sea hydrothermal vents to coastal ecosystems; tracked the movements of fish and interrogated historical records to learn what the ocean used to be like before the influence of humans; and employed forecasting methods to predict what may happen to ocean life in the future. One of the largest scientific collaborations ever conducted, by 2011 the Census had produced over 3,100 scientific papers and many thousands of other information products, with over 30 million species distribution records freely available via OBIS.&lt;ref&gt;Penman et al., pages vii, ix.&lt;/ref&gt;

As well as its tangible scientific legacy, the Census was instrumental in building a global community of researchers, many of whom had never collaborated before until they were brought together under the auspices of the Census, and a new approach to collaborative research. As Ian Poiner, outgoing chair of the Census has said, "The Census changed our views on how things could be done. We shared our problems and we shared our solutions."&lt;ref&gt;Penman et al., 2011, page iii.&lt;/ref&gt; In their 2011 review of the Census commissioned by the Alfred P. Sloan Foundation, David Penman and co-authors wrote: "[Prior to the Census there was] A fragmented research community: Marine biodiversity researchers had few active coordinated national and international research programs and taxonomic research in particular was underfunded and scattered in disparate organizations... [there was] No culture of collaboration and data sharing: Unlike the oceanographic community, marine biology was characterized by small research projects leading to publications but there was little experience or willingness to openly collaborate and share data... [and in addition there was] No recognized open-access data portal for marine biodiversity data: Unlike the "physical science" oceanographic community, there was no recognized data depository or common standards for sharing marine biodiversity data."&lt;ref&gt;Penman et al., 2011, page 1.&lt;/ref&gt;

As summarizing remarks, Penman ''et al.'', writing in 2011, stated:

&lt;blockquote&gt;"The Census, by any statistical measure, was a great success. The large number of scientific papers published and still to be published by Census participants, alone, would be sufficient. Instead the Census has achieved truly global science in biology. It did not profess to provide a complete Census of life in the ocean in 2010 but it did substantially increase the baselines of knowledge in often underexplored ocean realms. From this knowledge base future research and surveys will add more data that can be shared through web-based services such as OBIS. From this we may be able to derive estimates of population diversity, distribution and abundance for selected groups of organisms or regions and a future compilation of such data will show how far our knowledge has moved from 2010... Undoubtedly much research on marine biodiversity would have been carried out over the last decade without the Census. But it would have lacked the global reach and the access to data and technologies that made the Census unique."&lt;ref&gt;Penman et al., 2011, pages 60-61.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In 2011, the Census Steering Committee received the [[International Cosmos Prize]] in recognition of its decade of international ocean research spanning multiple scientific disciplines.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.expo-cosmos.or.jp/main/cosmos/jyusyou/2011_e.html Expo '90 Foundation: International Cosmos Prize: The Prizewinner 2011]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Partnerships==
The Census partnered with the [[Encyclopedia of Life]] in creating pages for marine species, and supplied marine material for DNA barcoding in the [[Barcode of Life]] project. [[Google]] and Census of Marine Life partnered on [[Google Earth]] 5.0. Ocean in Google Earth contains a layer devoted to the Census of Marine Life that allows users to follow scientists from the Census on expeditions and see marine life and features found during the Census.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2009/feb/02/google-earth-oceans |title=Google Earth adds insight into Earth's oceans &amp;#124; Environment &amp;#124; guardian.co.uk |publisher=Guardian |accessdate=2009-03-23 | location=London | first=Alok | last=Jha | date=2009-02-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; A partnership with the French film company Galatée Films resulted in the production of the film ''[[Oceans (film)|Oceans]]'' which was released in 2009, featuring film of over 200 species at more than 50 global locations.&lt;ref&gt;Snelgrove, pages 76-77.&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Centre for History and Philosophy of Science''' is a research institution devoted to the historical and philosophical study of science and technology, based in the Department of [[Philosophy]], at the [[University of Leeds]] in [[West Yorkshire]], England. The Centre – previously known as the Division of History and Philosophy of Science, which was founded in 1956 – is one of the oldest institutions of its kind in the world. Throughout its history, the Centre has been home to many of the leading historians and philosophers of science who have shaped our understanding of scientific activity and how it shapes and is shaped by wider society.

==Early history and expansion==
The key figure in establishing history and philosophy of science (HPS) as a discipline at Leeds was the philosopher of science [[Stephen Toulmin]], who was appointed Professor of Philosophy at Leeds in 1954 and head of department in 1956. Whilst [[Thomas Kuhn]] is often seen as the founder of the modern field of history and philosophy of science, Toulmin had argued for an integration of philosophy of science and history of science some nine years before Kuhn published his famous work, ''The Structure of Scientific Revolutions''.&lt;ref&gt;Toulmin, ''Philosophy of Science: An Introduction'' (1953)&lt;/ref&gt;
After becoming head of the department of philosophy, Toulmin hired two young scholars who would subsequently become amongst the most important thinkers in history and philosophy of science: Jerry Ravetz&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jerryravetz.co.uk/ Jerry Ravetz], UK.&lt;/ref&gt; and June Goodfield. Furthermore, physicist-turned-historian Donald Cardwell become a research fellow in HPS and then a lecturer. However, Cardwell left Leeds in 1963 to start a similar department at UMIST. When Toulmin, followed by Goodfield, left Leeds for the USA in 1959, Ravetz led the Leeds HPS group into a period of expansion during the 1960s, which is described by many as a ‘golden age’ of HPS at Leeds. A number of scholars were hired, including Piyo Rattansi, Charles Webster, Ted McGuire, Maurice Crosland, and Charles Schmitt, and a number of postgraduate students who would go to become leading HPS thinkers, such as Margaret Jacob&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sscnet.ucla.edu/history/jacob/ Margaret Jacob] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081207224607/http://www.sscnet.ucla.edu/history/jacob/ |date=December 7, 2008 }}, [[UCLA]], USA.&lt;/ref&gt; and Robert Fox,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.history.ox.ac.uk/staff/faculty/fox_r.htm Robert Fox], [[University of Oxford]], UK.&lt;/ref&gt; studied at Leeds with them.   

In the 1970s, after the departures of – amongst others – Webster and Crosland, historian of genetics Robert Olby became a leading figure in the Division through his book ''Path to the Double Helix'',&lt;ref&gt;Robert Olby, ''Path to the Double Helix'' (1974).&lt;/ref&gt; which showed how the 1953 discoveries of [[Francis Crick|Crick]] and [[James D. Watson|Watson]] were rooted in the work of two University of Leeds scientists: the creator of molecular biology, [[William Astbury]], and the Nobel prizewinning inventor of [[X-ray crystallography]], [[William Henry Bragg]]. During this period, a number of scholars who would shape HPS at Leeds during the 1980s and 1990s were appointed. These scholars included John Christie&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.philosophy.leeds.ac.uk/Staff/Jrrc/Index.htm John Christie] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090807234936/http://www.philosophy.leeds.ac.uk/Staff/Jrrc/Index.htm |date=August 7, 2009 }}, University of Leeds, UK.&lt;/ref&gt; Jonathan Hodge&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.philosophy.leeds.ac.uk/Staff/JH/Index.htm Jonathan Hodge] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090614083917/http://www.philosophy.leeds.ac.uk/Staff/JH/Index.htm |date=June 14, 2009 }}, University of Leeds, UK.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Geoffrey Cantor]], whose groundbreaking research on the history of physics – in particular [[Isaac Newton]] and [[Michael Faraday]] – would earn him the first professorship in the HPS division at Leeds.&lt;ref&gt;''Michael Faraday: Sandemanian and Scientist : a Study of Science and Religion in the Nineteenth Century'' (1991), ''Optics After Newton: Theories of Light in Britain and Ireland, 1704–1840'' (1983).&lt;/ref&gt; Jonathan Hodge collaborated with Geoffrey Cantor on the classic co-edited study ''Conceptions of Ether: Studies in the History of Ether Theories, 1740–1900'' (1981). However, Dr Hodge’s main research interest lies in the history of theories of creation and, in this context, he has written historical articles on the theories of [[Georges-Louis Leclerc, Comte de Buffon]] and [[Ronald Fisher]], as well as philosophical pieces on evolutionary biology. In chronological terms, Hodge’s historical focus has been on the period 1770–1850, especially in France and Britain, working on [[Jean-Baptiste Lamarck]] and [[Charles Darwin]]. Monographs are under preparation{{when|date=January 2011}} on the last two, following on from the ''Cambridge Companion to Darwin'' (2003), which was co-edited with recently arrived colleague Gregory Radick, and recently issued in a second edition to celebrate the 150th anniversary of the publication of ''On the Origin of Species''.

John Christie has a broad range of expertise in enlightenment science, especially th history of chemistry. A significant proportion of his articles focus on the characters of [[William Cullen]] and [[Joseph Black]] in [[Edinburgh]] and on [[Joseph Priestley]] in Leeds. Christie, too, has collaborated with Geoffrey Cantor, their shared interests in linguistic aspects of science leading to the co-edited volume ''The Figural and the Literal: Problems of Language in the History of Science and Philosophy, 1630–1800'' (1987).

Notable research students supervised by Cantor, Hodge, and Christie include:

* Chris Kenny&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.leeds.ac.uk/arts/people/20048/philosophy/person/842/chris_kenny Chris Kenny], University of Leeds, UK.&lt;/ref&gt; – supervised by Cantor and now a teaching fellow in the Department of Philosophy at the University of Leeds. 
* Sam Alberti – co-supervised by Hodge, Graeme Gooday (Leeds), and Sally Shuttleworth (Sheffield), and now Keeper of Science and Technology at National Museums Scotland.
* Jan Golinski&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.unh.edu/history/golinski/index.html Jan Golinski] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090417055157/http://www.unh.edu/history/golinski/index.html |date=April 17, 2009 }}, [[University of New Hampshire]], USA.&lt;/ref&gt; – supervised by Christie and now Professor of History and Humanities at the [[University of New Hampshire]].
* Mark Jackson&lt;ref&gt;[http://huss.exeter.ac.uk/history/staff/jackson/ Mark Jackson], [[University of Exeter]], UK.&lt;/ref&gt; – supervised by Christie and now Professor of the History of Medicine and Director of the Centre for Medical History at the [[University of Exeter]].

Furthermore, the collective endeavours of life in the Division of HPS at Leeds were epitomized in the much-cited multi-authored ''Companion to the History of Modern Science'' (1990), co-edited by Olby, Cantor, Christie and Hodge. Although there are now competitor volumes, articles from the Leeds Companion still reside on many a reading list for history of science courses throughout the world.

==Diversification and expansion in the 1990s==
From 1993 onwards, Leeds HPS took a new direction as several new specialist appointments were made in the philosophy of science, the history of medicine and the history of technology. Professor Steven French&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.leeds.ac.uk/arts/people/20048/philosophy/person/902/steven_french Steven French], University of Leeds, UK.&lt;/ref&gt; came to Leeds in 1993, having previously worked in Brazil and the USA. He teaches the philosophy of science, especially the philosophy of physics, and he has supervised numerous PhD students in both areas. His research covers several areas in the history and philosophy of physics. Primarily, Professor French is known for a structuralist approach to models and theories, which can be extended to cover issues of explanation and representation in science and also provides the formal basis for a form of structural realism. 

In the same year that Steven French was appointed, Adrian Wilson,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.leeds.ac.uk/arts/people/20048/philosophy/person/822/adrian_wilson Adrian Wilson], University of Leeds, UK.&lt;/ref&gt; Lecturer in History of Medicine, came to the Division under a Wellcome University Award. Dr Wilson’s main research focus is seventeenth- and eighteenth-century midwifery/childbirth, particularly with reference to male and female roles in delivery – a subject he explored in his book ''The Making of Man-Midwifery'' (1995). However, Dr. Wilson also studies English provincial voluntary hospitals in the eighteenth century and the history of pathology.   With help from colleagues, Dr. Wilson built up History of Medicine teaching both as part of the HPS degree programmes (BA and MA) and within the medical curriculum; and Leeds now offers an Intercalated Degree in History of Medicine (only the fourth such degree in Britain). 

In 1994, Graeme Gooday&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.leeds.ac.uk/arts/people/20048/philosophy/person/860/graeme_gooday Graeme Gooday], University of Leeds, UK.&lt;/ref&gt; was appointed to teach courses on the history and philosophy (especially the ethics) of technology. Gooday’s main research interests are in the history of late nineteenth-century physics, technology, instrumentation, and gender. In particular, as demonstrated by his first book, ''The Morals of Measurement: Accuracy, Irony and Trust in Late Victorian Electrical Practice'' (2004), Gooday focuses on the history of laboratories, the multifaceted roles of measurement and on the spatial issues of scientific practice.

Jonathan Topham&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.leeds.ac.uk/arts/people/20048/philosophy/person/872/jon_topham Jonathan Topham], University of Leeds, UK.&lt;/ref&gt;arrived in Leeds in 1999 as an AHRB Institutional Fellow for the Science in the Nineteenth-Century Periodical (SciPer) Project,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sciper.leeds.ac.uk/ Science in the Nineteenth-Century Periodical (SciPer) Project], University of Leeds, UK.&lt;/ref&gt; having previously worked on the Darwin Correspondence Project and at the [[University of Cambridge]]. The work of the SciPer Project reflects Dr Topham’s wide interest in the production and reading of scientific publications in nineteenth-century Britain, a subject on which he has published a number of widely cited articles. Topham’s other main research focus is on science and religion, and he has published valuable articles on natural theology and theologies of nature in nineteenth-century Britain. As a lecturer in history and philosophy of science since January 2005, Topham has helped develop a new Masters programme in science communication in collaboration with the University of Leeds’s Institute of Communication Studies.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.leeds.ac.uk/coursefinder/17024/MA_Science_Communication Communication Studies], University of Leeds, UK.&lt;/ref&gt;

After completing his postgraduate studies at [[University of Cambridge|Cambridge]], Dr Gregory Radick&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.leeds.ac.uk/arts/people/20048/philosophy/person/861/gregory_radick Gregory Radick], University of Leeds, UK.&lt;/ref&gt; was appointed as lecturer in the HPS Division in 2000 during Professor Cantor’s sabbatical, becoming a permanent member of staff in 2003. His research and teaching specialties are in the history of the life sciences and the human sciences, with special emphasis on questions of Darwinism and genetics. He has published and contributed to two co-edited volumes, including, with colleague Jonathan Hodge, ''The Cambridge Companion to Darwin'' (2003), which was recently issued as a second edition. Radick’s research work has concentrated on three themes in particular: scientific studies of animal mind and animal language; the role of social context and historical contingency in the development of modern biology; and the new genetic technologies in historical and philosophical perspective, concentrating especially on patenting and genetic testing. An interest in the relations between changing technology and changing knowledge runs throughout his work and was demonstrated in his first book, ''The Simian Tongue: The Long Debate About Animal Language'' (2008).

Notable postgraduate students at Leeds during and since the 1990s include:{{fact|date=January 2011}}

The '''Chester Ronning Centre for the Study of Religion and Public Life''' is a [[research centre]] on the [[University of Alberta]]'s [[Augustana University College|Augustana Campus]] in [[Camrose, Alberta]]. It is the first such centre in a public university in Canada to focus on the intersection of religion and public life.

==Background==
The Ronning Centre is named in for [[Chester Alvin Ronning]], Canadian diplomat and principal of Camrose Lutheran College from 1927 to 1942. The Chester Ronning Centre for the Study of Religion and Public Life grew from the merger of [[Augustana University College]] with the [[University of Alberta]] in 2004. The Centre's activities involve a diversity of communities. It seeks to enhance debate on contested issues through lively discussion.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.augustana.ualberta.ca/research/centres/ronningcentre/aboutus/ University of Alberta, Augustana Campus,

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4076">'''Community-based conservation''' is a [[conservation movement]] that emerged in the 1980s through escalating protests and subsequent dialogue with local communities affected by international attempts to protect the [[biodiversity]] of the earth. Older conservation movements disregarded the interests of local inhabitants.&lt;ref&gt;Brockington, D. (2002) Fortress Conservation: The Preservation of the Mkomazi Game Reserve, Tanzania. International African Institute, Oxford( {{ISBN|0-253-34079-9}})&lt;/ref&gt; This stems from the [[Western culture|Western]] idea on which the conservation movement was founded, of [[nature]] being separate from [[culture]]. The object of community-based conservation is to incorporate improvement to the lives of local people while conserving areas through the creation of national parks or wildlife refuges.&lt;ref&gt;Gezon, Lisa. (1997) Institutional structure and the effectiveness of integrated conservation and development projects: case study from Madagascar, Human Organization 56(4), pp. 462–470 (ISSN 0093-2930)&lt;/ref&gt;  While there have been some notable successes, unfortunately community-based conservation has often been ineffective because of inadequate resources, uneven implementation, and over-wishful planning.  Some critics have also complained about often unintended [[neocolonialism|neocolonialist]] undertones involved in the particular conservation projects.

==History==
The first protected areas around the world such as Yosemite in 1864 and Yellowstone National Park in 1872 were founded by the colonial or classical conservation method.&lt;ref&gt;Cholchester, M. (2004) Conservation Policy and Indigenous Peoples. Environmental Science &amp; Policy 7(3), pp.145-153&lt;/ref&gt; Classical conservation created protected areas to protect wilderness and wildlife areas of pristine wilderness that was untouched and uninhabited by humans. All people inhabiting these areas were removed from the land and displaced onto marginal land surrounding or near by the newly protected land. It is estimated that 20 million people were displaced from their land.&lt;ref&gt;Veit, P. G., Benson, C. (2004) When Parks and People Collide. Carnegie Council for Ethics in International Affairs. 16 Oct. 2009&lt;/ref&gt; This conservation strategy was used widely until the 1970s when indigenous people started to fight for their rights and land. In 1975 the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) and the World Parks Congress recognized the rights of indigenous people and to recognize their rights of the protected areas.&lt;ref&gt;Cholchester, M. (2004) Conservation Policy and Indigenous Peoples. Environmental Science &amp; Policy 7(3), pp.145-153&lt;/ref&gt; More policy changes came about that increased the rights of indigenous people. Community-based conservation came into action from these changes.

==Strategies==
One strategy of community-based conservation is co-management or joint management of a protected area. Co-management combines local peoples’ traditional knowledge of the environment with modern scientific knowledge of scientists.&lt;ref&gt;WPC Recommendation 25 Co-management of Protected Areas, World Parks Congress (2003) {{cite web |url=http://www.cceia.org/resources/publications/dialogue/2_11/section_2/4449.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-12-11 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060927164214/http://www.cceia.org/resources/publications/dialogue/2_11/section_2/4449.html |archivedate=2006-09-27 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Child, B.;Jones, B. (2006), Practical tools for community conservation in southern Africa, Participatory Learning and Action 55 (ISSN 1357-938X)&lt;/ref&gt; This combination of knowledge can lead to increased biodiversity and better management of the protected area.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="34539">In a paper delivered to the [[Aristotelian Society]] on 12 March 1956,&lt;ref&gt;Published immediately as Gallie (1956a); a later, slightly altered version appears in Gallie (1964).&lt;/ref&gt; [[W. B. Gallie|Walter Bryce Gallie]] (1912&amp;ndash;1998) introduced the term '''essentially contested concept''' to facilitate an understanding of the different applications or interpretations of the sorts of abstract, [[Qualitative properties|qualitative]], and [[Evaluation|evaluative]] notions&lt;ref&gt;They are "evaluative" in the sense that they deliver some sort of "value-judgement".&lt;/ref&gt;—such as "[[art]]" and "[[social justice]]"—used in the domains of [[aesthetics]], [[political philosophy]], [[philosophy of history]], and [[philosophy of religion]].

Garver (1978) describes their use as follows:

&lt;blockquote&gt;The term essentially contested concepts gives a name to a problematic situation that many people recognize: that in certain kinds of talk there is a variety of meanings employed for key terms in an argument, and there is a feeling that [[Dogma#Dogma outside of religion|dogmatism]] ("My answer is right and all others are wrong"), [[skepticism]] ("All answers are equally true (or false); everyone has a right to his own truth"), and [[eclecticism]] ("Each meaning gives a partial view so the more meanings the better") are none of them the appropriate attitude towards that variety of meanings.&lt;ref&gt;Garver (1978), p. 168.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Essentially contested concepts involve widespread agreement on a [[concept]] (e.g., "fairness"), but not on the best realization thereof.&lt;ref&gt;Hart (1961, p. 156) speaks of "a uniform or constant feature", and "a shifting or varying criterion used in determining when, for any given purposes, cases are alike or different".&lt;/ref&gt; They are "concepts the proper use of which inevitably involves endless disputes about their proper uses on the part of their users",&lt;ref&gt;Gallie (1956a), p. 169. The dispute is about the proper use of the concept; and all argue that the concept is being "used inappropriately" by others (Smith, 2002, p. 332).&lt;/ref&gt; and these disputes "cannot be settled by appeal to [[empirical evidence]], linguistic usage, or the canons of logic alone".&lt;ref&gt;Gray (1977), p. 344.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Identifying the presence of a dispute==

Although Gallie's term is widely used to denote imprecise use of [[technical terminology]], it has a far more specific application. And, although the notion could be misleadingly and evasively used to justify "agreeing to disagree",&lt;ref&gt;A statement that, in essence, is usually nothing more than a simple observation that the apparent dispute it is simply a consequence of the same label being applied to different referents.&lt;/ref&gt; the term offers something more valuable:
&lt;blockquote&gt;Since its introduction by W.B. Gallie in 1956, the expression "essentially contested concept" has been treated both as a challenge and as an excuse by social theorists. It has been treated as a challenge in that theorists consider their uses of terms and concepts to be in competition with the uses advocated by other theorists, each theorist trying to be deemed the champion. It has been treated as an excuse in that, rather than acknowledge that the failure to reach agreement is due to such factors as imprecision, ignorance, or belligerence, instead theorists point to the terms and concepts under dispute and insist that they are always open to contest — that they are terms and concepts about which we can never expect to reach agreement.&lt;ref&gt;Rhodes (2000), p. 1.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The disputes that attend an essentially contested concept are driven by substantive disagreements over a range of different, entirely [[reasonable]] (although perhaps mistaken) interpretations of a mutually-agreed-upon [[archetypical]] notion, such as the legal precept "treat like cases alike; and treat different cases differently", with "each party [continuing] to defend its case with what it claims to be convincing arguments, evidence and other forms of justification".&lt;ref&gt;Gallie (1956a) p. 168.&lt;/ref&gt;

Gallie speaks of how "This picture is painted in [[Oil paint|oils]]" can be successfully contested if the work is actually painted in [[tempera]];&lt;ref&gt;Gallie (1956a), p. 167.&lt;/ref&gt; while "This picture is a work of art" may meet strong opposition due to disputes over what "work of art" denotes. He suggests three avenues whereby one might resolve such disputes:
#Discovering a new meaning of "work of art" to which all disputants could thenceforward agree.
#Convincing all the disputants to conform to one meaning. 
#Declaring "work of art" to be a number of different concepts employing the same name.
 
Otherwise, the dispute probably centres on [[polysemy]].&lt;ref&gt;The embedded meaning of the term ''[[polysemy]]'' is that the polysemous word’s meanings have multiplied over time (in the sense of its original meaning being extended).
* When discussing finance, "bank" is an essentially contested concept; because the discussion involves establishing the "correct" application, meaning or interpretation of this polysemous term.
* In a different dispute over banks, where one speaks of [[Bank|financial institutions]] and the other of [[riparian zones]], it is obvious that two [[homonyms]] have been confused.&lt;/ref&gt;
Here, a number of critical questions must be asked:
* Has the term been incorrectly used, as in the case of mistakenly using [[Decimation (Roman Army)|decimated]] for devastated ([[catachresis]])?&lt;ref&gt;Which is "''a conflict between truth and error''" (Garver, 1990, p. 259)&lt;/ref&gt;
* Do two or more different concepts share the same word, as in the case of ''ear'', ''bank'', ''sound'', ''corn'', ''scale'', etc. ([[homonymy]])?&lt;ref&gt;Which is "''a disagreement generated because the parties to the conflict are [[talking past each other]]''" (Garver, 1990, p. 259) – the "talking past each other" is an allusion to the interaction between [[Thrasymachus]] and [[Socrates]] over the question of "justice" in Plato's ''[[Republic (Plato dialogue)|Republic I]]'', where neither addressed any of the issues raised by the other. Gallie (1956a, p. 168.) speaks of this as being a case in which "''two '''different''' concepts about whose proper application no one need to have contested at all''" having become "'''confused'''".&lt;/ref&gt;
* Is there a genuine dispute about the term's correct application that, in fact, ''can'' be resolved?
* Or, is it really the case that the term is an ''essentially contested concept''?

===Contested versus contestable===
Clarke has made a valuable contribution to the overall debate by suggesting that, in order to determine whether a particular dispute was a consequence of true polysemy or inadvertent homonymy, one should seek to "locate the source of the dispute".

This source might be "within the concept itself", or "[within] some underlying non-conceptual disagreement between the contestants".&lt;ref&gt;Clarke (1979), p. 123.&lt;/ref&gt;

Clarke then drew attention to the substantial differences between the expressions "essentially contested" and "essentially contestable", that were being extensively used within the literature as though they were interchangeable.

Clarke argued that to state that a concept is merely "contested" is to "attribute significance to the contest rather than to the concept". Yet, to state that a concept is "contestable" is to "attribute some part of any contest to the concept". In other words, this is "to claim that some feature or property of the concept makes it polysemantic, and that the concept contains some internal conflict of ideas"; and it is this fact that provides the "essentially contested concept" with its ''inherent potential'' for "generating disputes".&lt;ref&gt;Clarke (1979), p. 124.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Features==
In 1956 Gallie proposed a set of seven conditions for the existence of an essentially contested concept.&lt;ref&gt;See Gallie (1956a).&lt;/ref&gt; Gallie was very specific about the limits of his enterprise: it dealt exclusively with abstract, qualitative notions, such as ''art'', ''religion'', ''science'', ''democracy'', and ''social justice''&lt;ref&gt;Gallie (1956a), passim. Kekes (1977, p. 71) offers ''art'', ''morality'', ''logic'', ''the novel'', ''nature'', ''rationality'', ''democracy'', ''culture'', ''science'', and ''philosophy'' as another set of examples of "concepts" that are ''essentially contested''.&lt;/ref&gt; (and, if Gallie’s choices are contrasted with negatively regarded concepts such as ''evil'', ''disease'', ''superstition'', etc., it is clear that the concepts he chose were exclusively positively regarded).

Freeden remarks that "not all essentially contested concepts signify valued achievements; they may equally signify disapproved and denigrated phenomena",&lt;ref&gt;Freeden (1998), p. 56.&lt;/ref&gt; and Gerring&lt;ref&gt;Gerring (1999), p. 385.&lt;/ref&gt; asks us to imagine just how difficult it would be to "[try] to craft definitions of slavery, fascism, terrorism, or genocide without recourse to 'pejorative' attributes".

These features distinguish Gallie's "essentially contested concepts" from others, "which can be shown, as a result of analysis or experiment, to be radically confused";&lt;ref&gt;Gallie (1956a), p. 180.&lt;/ref&gt; or, as Gray&lt;ref&gt;Gray (1977), p. 337.&lt;/ref&gt; would have it, they are the features that relate to the task of distinguishing the "general words, which really denote an essentially contested concept" from those other "general words, whose uses conceal a diversity of distinguishable concepts":&lt;ref&gt;They are unpackings of, elaborations upon, or extensions of Gallie's original seven features that have been made by a very wide range of scholars spread over a wide range of academic and intellectual pursuits over the last 60 years.&lt;/ref&gt;

#Essentially contested concepts are ''evaluative'', and they deliver ''value-judgements''.&lt;ref&gt;Baldwin stresses that whilst "''not all value judgements are appraisive''", "''[any act of] appraisal presupposes an accepted set of criteria''" (Baldwin (1997), p. 10.&lt;/ref&gt;
#Essentially contested concepts denote comprehensively evaluated entities that have an ''internally complex'' character.&lt;ref&gt;For this reason, Benn and Gaus (1983, pp. 3-5) advocate using the term "''complex-structured concepts''".&lt;/ref&gt;
#The evaluation must be attributed to the internally complex entity ''as a whole''. 
#The different ''constituent elements'' of that internally complex entity are initially ''variously describable''.
#The different users of the concept will often allocate substantially different orders of ''relative importance'', substantially different "''weights''", and/or substantially different ''interpretations'' to each of those constituent elements.
#Psychological and sociological causes influence the extent to which any particular ''consideration'' is ''salient'' for a given individual, regarded as a ''stronger reason'' by that individual than by another, and regarded as ''a reason'' by one individual and not by another.&lt;ref&gt;Mason (1990), p. 96.&lt;/ref&gt;
#The disputed concepts are ''open-ended''&lt;ref&gt;Gallie cites "''democracy''" an example of a concept being "''open''" in its character: "''Politics being the art of the possible, '''democratic targets will be raised or lowered as circumstances alter''', and democratic achievements are always judged in the light of such alterations''" (Gallie, 1956a, p. 186, emphasis added).&lt;/ref&gt; and vague, and are subject to considerable modification in the light of ''changing circumstances''.&lt;ref&gt;Because, in the absence of this condition, it is possible that experience could establish one ''instantiation'' as "''universally more acceptable than another''" (Gallie, 1956a, p. 174).&lt;/ref&gt;
#This further modification can neither be ''predicted'' nor ''prescribed'' in advance.
#Whilst, by Gallie's express stipulation, there is no ''best'' instantiation of an essentially contested concept (or, at least, none knowable to be the best), it is also obvious that some instantiations will be considerably ''better'' than others;&lt;ref&gt;Swanton (1985), p. 815.&lt;/ref&gt; and, furthermore, even if one particular instantiation seems best at the moment, there is always the possibility that a new, better instantiation will emerge in the future.&lt;ref&gt;Mason (1990), p. 85.&lt;/ref&gt;
#Each party knows and recognizes that its own peculiar usage/interpretation of the concept is disputed by others who, in their turn, hold different and quite incompatible views.&lt;ref&gt;For, otherwise, it would only be, at best, an essentially "''contestable''" concept.&lt;/ref&gt;
#Each party must (at least to a certain extent) understand the criteria upon which the other participants’ (repudiated) views are based.
#Disputes centred on essentially contested concepts are "perfectly genuine", "not resolvable by argument",&lt;ref&gt;Connolly (1974, p. 40) expressed the view that once the participants in a particular political dispute realized that the concept was an essentially contested concept, the ensuing political discussions would be far more "''enlightened''" (Connolly, 1974, p. 40).&lt;/ref&gt; and "nevertheless sustained by perfectly respectable arguments and evidence".&lt;ref&gt;All from Gallie (1956a), p. 169.&lt;/ref&gt; 
#Each party's use of their own specific usage/interpretation is driven by a need to ''uphold'' their own particular (''correct'', ''proper'' and ''superior'') usage/interpretation against that of all other (''incorrect'', ''improper'' and ''irrational'') users.
#Because the use of an essentially contested concept is always the application of one use ''against'' all other uses, any usage is intentionally ''aggressive'' and ''defensive''.
#Because it is essentially contested, rather than "radically confused", the continued use of the essentially contested concept is justified by the fact that, despite all of their on-going disputation, ''all'' of the competitors acknowledge that the contested concept is derived from a ''single common exemplar''.&lt;ref&gt;This agreement is ''a pre-requisite for'' the argument, it is not ''a consequence of'' the argument. See McKnight (2003), p. 261; and Perry (1977), p. 25. In an attempt to account for cases where disputants trace their individual notions back to ''entirely different'', but ''mutually compatible exemplars'', Connolly (1974, p. 14) proposes that we think of the shared exemplar as a "cluster concept".&lt;/ref&gt;
#The continued use of the essentially contested concept also helps to sustain and develop our understanding of the concept's original exemplar/s.

== Concepts and conceptions ==
Scholars such as [[H. L. A. Hart]], [[John Rawls]], [[Ronald Dworkin]], and [[Steven Lukes]] have variously embellished Gallie's proposal by arguing that certain of the difficulties encountered with Gallie’s proposition may be due a consequence of the unintended [[Conflation#Logic|conflation]] of two separate domains associated with the term ''concept'':
: (a) the ''concepts'' (the abstract, ideal ''notions'' themselves), and
: (b) the ''conceptions'' (the particular ''instantiations'', or ''realizations'' of those ideal and abstract notions).&lt;ref&gt;The concept/conception terminology seems to originate with Gallie's (1956a) own comment that, whilst they might still continue to employ the contested ''concept'', the "different teams [could] come to hold… very different ''conceptions'' of how the game should be played" (p. 176, emphasis added).&lt;/ref&gt;

In essence, Hart (1961), Rawls (1971), Dworkin (1972), and Lukes (1974) distinguished between the "unity" of a notion and the "multiplicity" of its possible instantiations.

From their work it is easy to understand the issue as one of determining whether there is a single notion that has a number of different instantiations, or whether there is more than one notion, each of which is reflected in a different ''usage''.

In a section of his 1972 article in ''The New York Review of Books'', Dworkin used the example of "fairness" to isolate and elaborate the difference between a ''concept'' (''[[Jedem das Seine|suum cuique]]'') and its ''conception'' (various instantiations, for example [[utilitarian ethics]]).&lt;ref&gt;Dworkin (1972), pp. 27-28 (an almost identical passage appears at Dworkin, 1972, pp. 134-135). The four-paragraph passage is in Section II of the article [http://www.nybooks.com/articles/10204]. It commences with "''But the theory of… ''" and ends with "''…I try to answer it ''".&lt;/ref&gt;

He supposes that he has instructed his children not to treat others "unfairly" and asks us to recognize that, whilst he would have undoubtedly had particular "examples" (of the sorts of conduct he was intending to discourage) in mind at the time he spoke to his children, whatever it was that he ''meant'' when he issued such instructions was not confined to those "examples" alone, for two reasons:

#"I would expect my children to apply my instructions to situations I had not and could not have thought about."
#"I stand ready to admit that some particular act I had thought was fair when I spoke was in fact unfair, or vice versa, if one of my children is able to convince me of that later."

Dworkin argues that this admission of error would not entail any "change" to his original instructions, because the true ''meaning'' of his instructions was that "[he] meant the family to be guided by the ''concept'' of fairness, not by any specific ''conception'' of fairness [that he] might have had in mind". Therefore, he argues, his instructions do, in fact, "cover" this new case.
 
Exploring what he considers to be the "crucial distinction" between the overall ''concept'' of "fairness" and some particular, and specific ''conception'' of "fairness", he asks us to imagine a group whose members share the view that certain acts are ''unfair''.&lt;ref&gt;These unfair acts involve either "a wrongful division of benefits and burdens, or a wrongful attribution of praise or blame".&lt;/ref&gt;

The members of this group "agree on a great number of standard cases of unfairness and use these as benchmarks against which to test other, more controversial cases".

In these circumstances, says Dworkin, "the group has a ''concept'' of unfairness, and its members may appeal to that concept in moral instruction or argument."&lt;ref&gt;Emphasis added to original.&lt;/ref&gt;

However, the members may still disagree over many of these "controversial cases"; and differences of this sort indicate that members ''have'', or ''act upon'', entirely different theories of why and how each of the "standard cases" are, in fact, genuine acts of "unfairness".

And, because each considers that certain principles "[which] must be relied upon to show that a particular division or attribution is unfair" are far a more "fundamental" sort of principle than certain other principles, it can be said that members of the group have different ''conceptions'' of "fairness".

Consequently, those responsible for giving "instructions", and those responsible for setting "standards" of "fairness", in this community may be doing one of two things:
#Appealing to the ''concept'' of "fairness", by demanding that others act "fairly". In this case, those instructed to act "fairly" are responsible for "developing and applying their own conception of fairness as controversial cases arise".&lt;ref&gt;He notes that this does not "[grant] them a discretion to act as they like''"; but, from the fact that "it assumes that one conception is superior to another", it is clear that "it sets a standard they must try — and may fail — to meet".&lt;/ref&gt; Each of those issuing the instructions (or setting the standards) may have quite different explanations underlying their actions; and, also, they may well change their explanations from time to time, without ever changing the standards they set.&lt;ref&gt;Thus, we could say, there is a demand for [[orthopraxy]] (the correctness of action), not for [[orthodoxy]] (the correctness of thought).&lt;/ref&gt;
#Laying down a particular ''conception'' of "fairness"; by, for example, specifying that all hard cases were to be decided "by applying the [[Utilitarianism|utilitarian ethics]] of [[Jeremy Bentham]]".

It is important to recognize that rather than it just being a case of delivering two different instructions; it is a case of delivering two different ''kinds'' of instruction:
#In the case of the appeal to the ''concept'' of "fairness", one invokes the ideal (and, implicitly, the universally agreed upon) notion of "fairness"; and whatever one might believe is the best ''instantiation'' of that notion is, by and large, irrelevant. 
#In the case of laying down a ''conception'' of "fairness", one specifies what one believes to be the best instantiation of the notion "fairness"; and, by this action, one specifies what one ''means'' by "fairness"; and whatever one might believe is the ideal ''notion'' of "fairness" is, by and large, irrelevant.

As a consequence, according to Dworkin, whenever an appeal is made to "fairness", a moral issue is raised; and, whenever a conception of "fairness" is laid down, an attempt is being made to answer that moral issue.

==Not "hotly disputed" concepts==
Whilst Gallie's expression "essentially contested concepts" precisely denotes those "essentially questionable and corrigible concepts" which "are permanently and essentially subject to revision and question",&lt;ref&gt;Hampshire (1965), p. 230.&lt;/ref&gt; close examination of the wide and varied and imprecise applications of Gallie's term subsequent to 1956, by those who have ascribed their own literal meaning to Gallie's term without ever consulting Gallie's work, have led many philosophers to conclude that "essentially disputed concepts" would have been far better choice for Gallie's meaning, for at least three reasons:

#Gallie's term has led many to the mistaken belief that he spoke of ''hotly disputed'', rather than ''essentially disputed'' concepts.&lt;ref&gt;See Waldron (2002).&lt;/ref&gt;
#Expressly stipulating that a specific issue can never be resolved, and then calling it a "contest" seems both absurd and misleading.&lt;ref&gt;There seems to be a radical fault in the very notion of a contest that can not by its nature be won or lost. (Gray, 1999, p. 96)&lt;/ref&gt;
#Any assertion that "essentially contested" concepts are ''[[Commensurability (ethics)|incommensurable]]'' made at the same time as an assertion that "they have any common subject-matter" is incoherent; and, also, it reveals an "inconsistency in the idea of essential contestability".&lt;ref&gt;Gray (1999), p. 96.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Jeremy Waldron]]'s research has revealed that Gallie's notion has "run wild" in the law review literature over the ensuing 60 years and is now being used to denote something like "very hotly contested, with no resolution in sight",&lt;ref&gt;Waldron (2002, p. 149) found that the following concepts had been labelled as "essentially contested" in the [[Westlaw]] database: alienation, autonomy, author, bankruptcy, boycott, citizenship, civil rights, coherence, community, competition, the Constitution, corruption, culture, discrimination, diversity, equality, equal protection, freedom, harm, justification, liberalism, merit, motherhood, the national interest, nature, popular sovereignty, pornography, power, privacy, property, proportionality, prosperity, prostitution, public interest, punishment, reasonable expectations, religion, republicanism, rights, sovereignty, speech, sustainable development, and textuality.&lt;/ref&gt; due to an entirely mistaken view&lt;ref&gt;Of course, the equivalent view about the term in general is reasonable: it merely uses the descriptive [[definition]]. The descriptive definition is still a definition, even if one may think it less interesting than Gallie's definition.&lt;/ref&gt; that the ''essential'' in Gallie's term is an "[[intensifier]]", when, in fact, "[Gallie's] term 'essential' refers to the location of the disagreement or indeterminacy; it is contestation at the core, not just at the borderlines or penumbra of a concept".&lt;ref&gt;Waldron (2002), pp. 148-149.&lt;/ref&gt;

Yet is also clear that "if the notion of logical justification can be applied only to such theses and arguments as can be presumed capable of gaining in the long run universal agreement, the disputes to which the uses of any essentially contested concept give rise are not genuine or rational disputes at all"{{clarify|date=May 2012}} (Gallie, 1956a, p.&amp;nbsp;188).

Thus, Gallie argued:

&lt;blockquote&gt;So long as contestant users of any essentially contested concept believe, however deludedly, that their own use of it is the only one that can command honest and informed approval, they are likely to persist in the hope that they will ultimately persuade and convert all their opponents by logical means. But once [we] let the truth out of the bag — i.e., the essential contestedness of the concept in question — then this harmless if deluded hope may well be replaced by a ruthless decision to cut the cackle, to damn the heretics and to exterminate the unwanted.&lt;ref&gt;Gallie, 1956a, pp. 193-194&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The contest was inspired by [[Netherlands|Dutch]] comedian [[Arjen Lubach]]'s show ''[[Zondag met Lubach]]'', which broadcast the parody video "The Netherlands welcomes Trump in his own words" on 22 January 2017.&lt;ref name="strijdt"/&gt; In the video, Trump's speeches and actions –mostly from [[Donald Trump presidential campaign, 2016|his election campaign]]– are imitated and mocked by voice actor [[Greg Shapiro]],&lt;ref name="Vanity1"&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2017/02/donald-trump-trolling-videos-america-first-netherlands-second-greg-shapiro-shaun-streeter |title=Meet the Men Trolling Trump in Those Viral European Videos |author=Hillary Busis |work=[[Vanity Fair (magazine)|Vanity Fair]] |date=7 February 2017 |accessdate=7 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; who gives a short description of the Netherlands using some [[self-mockery]] as well, finishing with the request that the Netherlands may come 'second' if America is to be 'first'.&lt;ref name="strijdt"/&gt; A semi-serious undertone is formed by fears that Trump's announced [[America First (policy)|"America First" policy]] signifies [[isolationism]], including withdrawing U.S. support for [[NATO]]:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.theatlantic.com/news/archive/2016/07/trump-nato/492341/ |title=Donald Trump's NATO Remarks Stuns U.S. Allies |author=Krishnadev Calamur  |work=[[The Atlantic]] |date=21 July 2016 |accessdate=8 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; "If you screw NATO, you're gonna make our problems [[Make America Great Again|great again]]."&lt;ref name="Erickson"&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/worldviews/wp/2017/01/25/dutch-tv-trolls-donald-trump-hard-in-this-new-welcome-video/ |title=Dutch TV trolls Donald Trump hard in this new ‘welcome’ video |author=Amanda Erickson |work=[[The Washington Post]] |date=25 January 2017 |accessdate=8 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The video went viral, being discussed by multiple international newsmedia&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2017/01/24/dutch-tv-trolls-donald-trumps-america-first-speech-welcome-video/ |title=Dutch TV trolls Donald Trump's 'America First' speech in 'welcome' video |author=Mark Molloy |work=The Daily Telegraph |date=24 January 2017 |accessdate=7 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/aponline/2017/01/26/world/europe/ap-eu-netherlands-viral-video.html |title=Video Introducing Trump to the Netherlands Goes Viral |author=AP |work=[[The New York Times]] |date=26 January 2017 |accessdate=7 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and reaching over 73 million views worldwide by 3 February.&lt;ref name="strijdt"/&gt;

=== Contest launched ===
[[File:America First – Germany Second.png|280px|thumb|[[Jan Böhmermann]] launches the video contest.]]
On 2 February during ''Neo Magazin Royale'', Böhmermann challenged the Dutch's second place, broadcasting a rival video that claimed 'Germany second' whilst making fun of the Netherlands and Germany itself as well. Then, he encouraged other satirical talkshow producers in all [[European countries]] to make similar videos parodying Trump, themselves and challenging the Netherlands' second place behind America.&lt;ref name="strijdt"/&gt;&lt;ref name="binnenkomen"&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://nos.nl/artikel/2156281-varianten-op-lubachs-introductievideo-blijven-binnenkomen.html |title=Varianten op Lubachs introductievideo blijven binnenkomen |work=[[Nederlandse Omroep Stichting|NOS]] |date=3 February 2017 |accessdate=7 February 2017 |language=nl}}&lt;/ref&gt; Production teams in at least eleven other countries committed to making their own parody videos, and by 3 February, versions for [[Belgium]] (by ''De Ideale Wereld''), [[Switzerland]] (by ''Deville Late Night''), [[Denmark]] (by ''Natholdet''), [[Portugal]] (by ''[[5 Para A Meia-Noite]]'') and [[Lithuania]] (by ''Laikykitės ten'') had been released; these would all be gathered on the website everysecondcounts.eu.&lt;ref name="strijdt"/&gt;&lt;ref name="binnenkomen"/&gt; Many of the videos are narrated by voice actor Shaun Streeter, with the exception of the [[China|Chinese]] and [[Japan]]ese versions.&lt;ref name="Vanity1"/&gt;

=== Beyond Europe ===
By 6 February, [[Italy]] (by ''Casa Surace''), [[Luxembourg]] (by ''Studio Ben''), and [[Morocco]] (a non-European country, expanding the contest further) had joined the fray.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.npr.org/sections/thetwo-way/2017/02/06/513744676/if-americas-no-1-whos-no-2-european-nations-compete-for-the-uh-honor |title=If America's No. 1, Who's No. 2?

== Common elements ==
[[File:POTUS visits DHS (32174751680).jpg|thumb|The videos make fun of [[Executive Order 13767|Trump's plan to build a Mexican wall]].]]
Though widely varying in contents specific to each country's presentation, and the way in which they criticise and/or ridicule President Trump and his ideas and actions, the videos often share common elements. Many revolve around (sarcastically) taking pride in or mocking their own country's history, and comparing it to Trump's actions or American history in general, and how the latter is better, equal or worse.&lt;ref name="Erickson"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Sjolin"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Wilhelmer"&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://kurier.at/kultur/floete-mit-schoko-hoden-was-an-austria-second-alles-nicht-lustig-war/245.474.681 |title=Flöte mit Schoko-Hoden: Was an "Austria Second" alles nicht lustig war |author=Philipp Wilhelmer |work=[[Kurier]] |date=8 February 2017 |accessdate=10 February 2017 |language=de}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Fertility in art''' refers to any [[artistic work]] representing or portraying [[fertility]], which usually refers to successful breeding among humans, although it may also mean successful [[agriculture]] and [[animal husbandry]].  It includes engravings, drawings, [[paintings]], [[sculptures]], [[figurines]], [[portraits]] and even [[literary works]]. In [[Paleolithic art]], fertility is usually associated with figurines with exaggerated parts of human anatomy. 

Many civilisations in history believed in fertility [[deities]]. In [[Classical mythology]], [[Gaia (mythology)|Gaia]] (to the [[Greeks]]) or [[Terra (mythology)|Terra]] (to the [[Romans]]), the personification of [[Earth]], is associated with [[female fertility]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.goddess-guide.com/greek-goddess-of-the-earth.html Greek Goddess of the Earth&lt;/ref&gt; Women are often depicted with a ripe [[bosom]], a child-bearing [[hip]] and a [[nude]] body in some cases.&lt;ref name=Fertility&gt;https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2008/mar/30/art.familyandrelationships Laura Cumming on fertility in art&lt;/ref&gt; Animals that [[reproduce]] prolifically are also seen in art depicting fertility.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.ae/books?id=9xkhBQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT577&amp;lpg=PT577&amp;dq=Animals+that+%5B%5Breproduce%5D%5D+prolifically+are+also+seen+in+art+depicting+fertility.&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=La01CAx3OF&amp;sig=bIowIpN3ZECwWjj3zvnf2akWJL4&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjxrIDa1c7TAhXFPBoKHYhTBboQ6AEIMjAD#v=onepage&amp;q=Animals+that+%5B%5Breproduce%5D%5D+prolifically+are+also+seen+in+art+depicting+fertility.&amp;f=false|title=Animals into Art|first=Howard|last=Morphy|date=30 October 2014|publisher=Routledge|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Traditional cultures==
[[File:Wien NHM Venus von Willendorf.jpg|thumb|170px|left|[[Venus of Willendorf]], considered to be an example of fertility in art.]]
Fertility was present in art traditionally in many different forms. These include ceramic figures from some [[Pre-Columbian]] cultures, and a few figures from most of the ancient Mediterranean cultures. Many of these seem to be connected with fertility. Palielothic statuettes had round [[abdomen|bellies]], short [[heads]] and short, pointed [[legs]]. They also exaggerate the [[hips]], breasts, [[thighs]], or [[vulva]] of the subject.

Two of the earliest known possible depictions of fertility in art are the ''[[Venus of Willendorf]]'' (c. 25,000 [[BCE]]), an [[Oolite|oolitic]] [[limestone]] figurine of a woman whose breasts and hips have been exaggerated to emphasise her fertility found in [[Austria]] and the ''Fertility Goddess'' of Cernavoda (c. 5,000 BCE) found in [[Romania]], a small figurine that is meant to possibly show fertility. Historians consider these figurines to be goddesses. It is believed that worshippers would push the pointed legs into the earth to erect a temporary [[shrine]] for the goddess. The rotundity and [[obesity]] of these figurines were seen as attractive in early times when [[food]] was scarce.&lt;ref&gt;Roberts, 747&lt;/ref&gt;

==Western art==
===Early forms===
[[File:TITIAN - Venus Anadyomene (National Galleries of Scotland, c. 1520. Oil on canvas, 75.8 x 57.6 cm).jpg|thumb|220px|[[Titian]], copy of the ''[[Venus Anadyomene]]'' ]]
[[Fertility]] is often shown in artworks related to [[Classical mythology]]. Paintings of the [[Greek goddess]] of love [[Aphrodite (mythology)|Aphrodite]] ([[Venus (mythology)|Venus]] to the [[Romans]]) often portray her as [[Human sexual activity|sexual]] and fertile. [[Homer]]'s ''[[Iliad]]'' states that Aphrodire (Venus) was born from the sperm/foam of the castrated genitals of [[Uranus (mythology)|Uranus]]. ''[[Venus Anadyomene]]'' is a painting by [[Apelles]] that shows Aphrodite rising from the sea. The original painting is now lost, but a colossal copy of the painting exists, painted by the artist [[Titian]] and known as [[Venus Anadyomene (Titian)|''Venus Anadyomene'' by Titian]]. It depicts Venus (Aphrodite) rising from the sea and wringing her wet hair after her birth, a pose inspired by an account of the original painting by Apelles.&lt;ref&gt;Roberts, 140 &lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.nationalgalleries.org/art-and-artists/8687/venus-rising-sea-venus-anadyomene-about-1520 Venus Rising from the Sea ('Venus Anadyomene') (About 1520)&lt;/ref&gt; [[Demeter]], the Greek goddess of [[agriculture]], [[grain crops]], [[fertility]] and motherly relationships is often shown carrying a basket of [[apples]] in [[sculptures]], which are meant to show fertility.&lt;ref name=Fertility/&gt;
[[File:Ostara by Johannes Gehrts.jpg|thumb|170px|left|[[Johannes Gehrts]]: Eostre, the [[Germanic mythology|Germanic goddess]] flies through the heavens surrounded by Roman-inspired [[putti]], beams of light, rabbits and birds. Germanic people look up at the goddess from the realm below.]]

[[Hares]] are often portrayed in art as a symbol of [[reincarnation|rebirth]] and fertility.&lt;ref&gt;C. G. Jung, ''Man and his Symbols'' (1964)p. 99&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Germanic mythology|Germanic]] goddess [[Eostre]], whose [[theme (arts)|themes]] are fertility and rebirth, is often surrounded by hares in art. 
In Christianity, white rabbits are considered to be symbols of rebirth and fertility and are seen on a wing of the high altar in [[Freiburg Minster]], where they are playing at the feet of two pregnant women, [[Mary, mother of Jesus|Mary]] and [[Elizabeth_(biblical_figure)|Elizabeth]].
In [[Jan Van Eyck]]'s ''[[Arnolfini portrait]]'', a carving of [[Margaret the Virgin|St. Margaret of Antioch]] (patron saint of childbirth) appears in the center background of the painting. The presence of this symbol in the painting either promises fertility in the marriage or announces the pregnancy of the bride.&lt;ref&gt;Roberts, 749 &lt;/ref&gt;

===Modern===
[[Paula Modersohn-Becker]]'s series of self-portraits showing her pregnant even before she had actually been so represent her fertility.&lt;ref&gt;Roberts, 64 &lt;/ref&gt;

[[Rembrandt]]'s ''[[The Jewish Bride]]'' is a painting of a couple joined in love. Despite the title, none of the subjects in the painting are [[Jewish]]. The Painting portrays the [[fertility]] of the young couple, particularly that of the woman.

The shoe tied to the happy couple's car can be seen to represent the fertile vagina, as with [[There was an Old Woman Who Lived in a Shoe|The Old Woman Who Lived in a Shoe]], a nursery rhyme.&lt;ref&gt;G. Legman, ''The Rationale of the Dirty Joke'' (1973) Vol II p. 90&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Botticelli]]'s ''Primavera'', on one hand the [[Charites|Three Graces]] represented by nubile young women embody the sexual powers of springtime while opposite them [[Flora (mythology)|Flora]], the goddess of Spring is a symbol of motherhood and, by her distribution of the roses gathered in her skirt, believed to represent the good things of life.&lt;ref&gt;Edmund Swinglehurts, ''Botticelli'' (1994) p. 26-7&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Picasso]]' paintings of [[Marie-Thérèse Walter]], everywhere there is green, the colour of fertility and nature's renewal.&lt;ref&gt;John Golding, in D. H Kahnweiler et al eds., ''Picasso 1881/1973'' (1973) p. 184&lt;/ref&gt; In his series of sleeping nudes, Picasso may have been influenced by the much reproduced [[Hal Saflieni Hypogeum|Hal Saflieni]] ''Reclining Woman'' and the Venuses of [[Venus of Lespugue|Lespugue]] and Willendorf, which with their heavy, ripe, bulging forms can be viewed as ancestresses of Picasso's images of female fecundity.&lt;ref&gt;Golding, p. 115-6&lt;/ref&gt;

===Literature===
In ''[[The Bacchae]]'', an [[Classical Greece|ancient Greek]] [[tragedy]] written by [[Classical Athens|Athenian]] playwright [[Euripides]], Dionysus is mentioned as a male fertility god that represented a special kind of vitality that is sometimes referred to as the [[Energy (esotericism)|Life Force]]. It is described a force which, in itself, is neither good nor bad, but one that simply exists.&lt;ref&gt;Neil Curry trans., ''Euripides'' (Cambridge 1981) p. 164 and p. 116&lt;/ref&gt;

When at the close of [[Possession (Byatt novel)|''Possession: A Romance'']], a novel by [[A. S. Byatt]], the two lovers Randolph Henry Ash and Christabel LaMotte finally unite in the midst of a great storm. They wake the next day to find that the whole world had a strange new smell. It is described as 'a green smell, a smell of shredded leaves and oozing resin, of crushed wood and splashed sap, a tart smell, which bore some relation to the smell of bitten apples.' It was the described as the smell of death and destruction, however, it was said to smell fresh, lively and hopeful.&lt;ref&gt;A. S. Byatt, ''Possession: A Romance'' (1991) p. 507&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3802">The '''Folkewall'''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.holon.se/folke/projects/openliw/openlev_en.shtml Folkewall]&lt;/ref&gt; is a construction with the dual functions of growing plants and purifying waste water.  It was designed by Folke Günther&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.holon.se/folke/cv/Eng/Biography/short.shtml Folke Günther]&lt;/ref&gt; in Sweden. 

Inspired by the "Sanitas wall" at Dr Gösta Nilsson's Sanitas farm project in [[Botswana]], this technique makes an efficient use of space by fulfilling two essential functions: vertical plant growing and [[Water purification|purification]] of [[greywater]]. This system is also known as a living wall or [[green wall]].

==Design==
The basic design is a wall of hollow concrete slabs, with compartments opening on one or both sides of the wall. The hollows are filled with inert material like [[gravel]], [[expanded clay aggregate]], [[perlite]], or [[vermiculite]]. It is designed to let the water [[Trickling filter|trickle]] over the longest possible treatment path along the length of the wall among the pebbles. 

The water is brought in at the top, and percolates following a zig-zag pattern inside the wall. As it does so the plant roots grow among the inert material and extract nutrients from the water. A film of [[Bioremediation|beneficial bacteria]] grows over the pebbles, releasing the nutrients in the percolating greywater. At the bottom of the wall a container collects the purified water, which can then be used for non-[[potable]] household use, for watering the garden, or it can be returned to the top of the wall.&lt;ref&gt;[http://archrecord.construction.com/features/digital/archives/0702dignews-1.asp Living wall systems ''(subscription required)'']&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other considerations==
''Plants used'': since the harvesting of the plants is a part of the purification process, fast growing, herbaceous crops are particularly suited for the Folkewall. Annual food crops are suitable, perennials like trees and shrubs should be avoided.

''Greywater'': The water feeding the plants in the wall must be free of [[heavy metals]] and/or unsafe [[pollutants]], notably [[human waste]]. This requires using source-separating toilets.

==Advantages==
* '''Better use of greywater''': most of the evaporation happens through the plant's leaves, which makes the method especially useful in arid climates. The Folkewall makes use of this aspect.
* '''More efficient use of the area'''. For example in greenhouses or other glazed areas where a wall is used as a greywater purification device, it also works as a '''heat exchanger and buffer'''.
* '''Purification''' of the percolating water, so greywater can be used as irrigation water.
* In warm climates, the wall can be used on the sunny side to '''cool the building'''. 
* '''Low-cost housing''': the combined use of Folkewalls and source-separating toilets would "reduce the infrastructure cost by about 30%".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fastonline.org/CD3WD_40/JF/JF_OTHER/SMALL/Growing%20wall%20-%20Water.pdf Growing walls]&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="44794">{{About|the scientific theory of that name||Fuzzy logic (disambiguation)}}
'''Fuzzy logic''' is a form of [[many-valued logic]] in which the [[truth value]]s of variables may be any real number between 0 and 1. It is employed to handle the concept of partial truth, where the truth value may range between completely true and completely false.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Novák, V. |last2=Perfilieva, I. |last3=Močkoř, J.  |title=Mathematical principles of fuzzy logic |date=1999 |publisher=Kluwer Academic |location=Dordrecht |isbn=978-0-7923-8595-0 |ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; By contrast, in [[Boolean algebra|Boolean logic]], the truth values of variables may only be the integer values 0 or 1.

The term ''fuzzy logic'' was introduced with the 1965 proposal of [[fuzzy set theory]] by [[Lotfi A. Zadeh|Lotfi Zadeh]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/logic-fuzzy/ |title=Fuzzy Logic |accessdate=2008-09-30 |work=Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy |publisher=Bryant University |date=2006-07-23 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Zadeh | first1 = L.A. | year = 1965 | title = Fuzzy sets | url = | journal = Information and Control | volume = 8 | issue = 3| pages = 338–353 | doi=10.1016/s0019-9958(65)90241-x}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Fuzzy logic had however  been studied since the 1920s, as [[Łukasiewicz logic|infinite-valued logic]]—notably by [[Jan Łukasiewicz|Łukasiewicz]] and [[Alfred Tarski|Tarski]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Pelletier | first1 = Francis Jeffry | year = 2000 | title = Review of ''Metamathematics of fuzzy logics'' | url = https://www.sfu.ca/~jeffpell/papers/ReviewHajek.pdf | format = PDF | journal = The Bulletin of Symbolic Logic | volume = 6 | issue = 3 | pages = 342–346 | jstor = 421060 | doi = 10.2307/421060 | deadurl = no | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20160303172812/http://www.sfu.ca/~jeffpell/papers/ReviewHajek.pdf | archivedate = 2016-03-03 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is based on the observation that people make decisions based on imprecise and non-numerical information, fuzzy models or sets are mathematical means of representing vagueness and imprecise information, hence the term fuzzy. These models have the capability of recognising, representing, manipulating, interpreting, and utilising data and information that are vague and lack certainty.&lt;ref&gt;What is Fuzzy Logic? [https://mechanicalsite.com/157/what-is-fuzzy-logic "Mechanical Engineering Discussion Forum"]&lt;/ref&gt;

Fuzzy logic has been applied to many fields, from [[control theory]] to [[artificial intelligence]].

==Overview==
[[Classical logic]] only permits conclusions which are either true or false. However, there are also propositions with variable answers, such as one might find when asking a group of people to identify a color.  In such instances, the truth appears as the result of reasoning from inexact or partial knowledge in which the sampled answers are mapped on a spectrum.{{Citation needed|date=May 2018}}

Both degrees of truth and [[probability|probabilities]] range between 0 and 1 and hence may seem similar at first, but fuzzy logic uses degrees of truth as a [[mathematical model]] of ''vagueness'', while [[probability]] is a mathematical model of ''ignorance''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=QBBADwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=SA4-PA13&amp;lpg=SA4-PA13&amp;dq=Both+degrees+of+truth+and+probabilities+range+between+0+and+1+and+hence+may+seem+similar+at+first,+but+fuzzy+logic+uses+degrees+of+truth+as+a+mathematical+model+of+vagueness,+while+probability+is+a+mathematical+model+of+ignorance#v=onepage&amp;q=Both%20degrees%20of%20truth%20and%20probabilities%20range%20between%200%20and%201%20and%20hence%20may%20seem%20similar%20at%20first,%20but%20fuzzy%20logic%20uses%20degrees%20of%20truth%20as%20a%20mathematical%20model%20of%20vagueness,%20while%20probability%20is%20a%20mathematical%20model%20of%20ignorance&amp;f=false|title=Handbook of Research for Fluid and Solid Mechanics: Theory, Simulation, and Experiment|last=Asli|first=Kaveh Hariri|last2=Aliyev|first2=Soltan Ali Ogli|last3=Thomas|first3=Sabu|last4=Gopakumar|first4=Deepu A.|date=2017-11-23|publisher=CRC Press|isbn=9781315341507|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Applying truth values===
A basic application might characterize various sub-ranges of a [[Variable (mathematics)|continuous variable]].  For instance, a temperature measurement for [[Anti-lock braking system|anti-lock brakes]] might have several separate membership functions defining particular temperature ranges needed to control the brakes properly. Each function maps the same temperature value to a truth value in the 0 to 1 range. These truth values can then be used to determine how the brakes should be controlled.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=-ZXJDQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA47&amp;dq=For+instance,+a+temperature+measurement+for+anti-lock+brakes+might+have+several+separate+membership+functions+defining+particular+temperature+ranges+needed+to+control+the+brakes+properly.+Each+function+maps+the+same+temperature+value+to+a+truth+value+in+the+0+to+1+range.+These+truth+values+can+then+be+used+to+determine+how+the+brakes+should+be+controlled#v=onepage&amp;q=For%20instance%2C%20a%20temperature%20measurement%20for%20anti-lock%20brakes%20might%20have%20several%20separate%20membership%20functions%20defining%20particular%20temperature%20ranges%20needed%20to%20control%20the%20brakes%20properly.%20Each%20function%20maps%20the%20same%20temperature%20value%20to%20a%20truth%20value%20in%20the%200%20to%201%20range.%20These%20truth%20values%20can%20then%20be%20used%20to%20determine%20how%20the%20brakes%20should%20be%20controlled&amp;f=false|title=Optical Character Recognition Systems for Different Languages with Soft Computing|last=Chaudhuri|first=Arindam|last2=Mandaviya|first2=Krupa|last3=Badelia|first3=Pratixa|last4=Ghosh|first4=Soumya K.|date=2016-12-23|publisher=Springer|isbn=9783319502526|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Linguistic variables===
While variables in mathematics usually take numerical values, in fuzzy logic applications, non-numeric values are often used to facilitate the expression of rules and facts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Zadeh |first1=L. A. |last2=et al. |title=Fuzzy Sets, Fuzzy Logic, Fuzzy Systems |date=1996 |publisher=World Scientific Press |isbn=978-981-02-2421-9 |ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A linguistic variable such as ''age'' may accept values such as ''young'' and its antonym ''old''.  Because natural languages do not always contain enough value terms to express a fuzzy value scale, it is common practice to modify linguistic values with [[adjectives]] or [[adverbs]].  For example, we can use the [[hedge (linguistics)|hedges]] ''rather'' and ''somewhat'' to construct the additional values ''rather old'' or ''somewhat young''.

Fuzzification operations can map mathematical input values into fuzzy membership functions. And the opposite de-fuzzifying operations can be used to map a fuzzy output membership functions into a "crisp" output value that can be then used for decision or control purposes.

==Process==

# Fuzzify all input values into fuzzy membership functions.
# Execute all applicable rules in the rulebase to compute the fuzzy output functions.
# De-fuzzify the fuzzy output functions to get "crisp" output values.

===Fuzzification===

{{Confusing|section|reason=this section does not give an explicit definition of what Fuzzification is or why it might need to be done|date=May 2018}}

[[Image:Fuzzy logic temperature en.svg|thumb|center|300px|Fuzzy logic temperature]]

In this image, the meanings of the expressions ''cold'', ''warm'', and ''hot'' are represented by functions mapping a temperature scale. A point on that scale has three "truth values"—one for each of the three functions. The vertical line in the image represents a particular temperature that the three arrows (truth values) gauge. Since the red arrow points to zero, this temperature may be interpreted as "not hot". The orange arrow (pointing at 0.2) may describe it as "slightly warm" and the blue arrow (pointing at 0.8) "fairly cold".

[[Fuzzy set]]s are often defined as triangle or trapezoid-shaped curves, as each value will have a slope where the value is increasing, a peak where the value is equal to 1 (which can have a length of 0 or greater) and a slope where the value is decreasing.{{Citation needed|date=September 2017}} They can also be defined using a [[sigmoid function]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Wierman|first1=Mark J.|title=An Introduction to the Mathematics of Uncertainty: including Set Theory, Logic, Probability, Fuzzy Sets, Rough Sets, and Evidence Theory|url=https://www.creighton.edu/fileadmin/user/CCAS/programs/fuzzy_math/docs/MOU.pdf|publisher=Creighton University|accessdate=16 July 2016|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120730155249/https://www.creighton.edu/fileadmin/user/CCAS/programs/fuzzy_math/docs/MOU.pdf|archivedate=30 July 2012|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; One common case is the [[Logistic function|standard logistic function]] defined as

: &lt;math&gt; S(x) = \frac{1}{1 + e^{-x}} &lt;/math&gt;

which has the following symmetry property

: &lt;math display="block"&gt; S(x) + S(-x) = 1 &lt;/math&gt;

From this it follows that

&lt;math display="block"&gt; (S(x) + S(-x)) \cdot (S(y) + S(-y)) \cdot (S(z) + S(-z)) = 1 &lt;/math&gt;

===Fuzzy logic operators===

Fuzzy logic works with membership values in a way that mimics [[Boolean logic]]. To this end, replacements for basic [[operator (computer programming)|operator]]s AND, OR, NOT must be available. There are several ways to this. A common replacement is called the ''Zadeh operators'':

{| class="wikitable"
|-
! Boolean
! Fuzzy
|-
| AND(x,y)
| MIN(x,y)
|-
| OR(x,y)
| MAX(x,y)
|-
| NOT(x)
| 1 – x
|-
|}

For TRUE/1 and FALSE/0, the fuzzy expressions produce the same result as the Boolean expressions.

There are also other operators, more linguistic in nature, called ''hedges'' that can be applied. These are generally adverbs such as ''very'', or ''somewhat'', which modify the meaning of a set using a [[mathematical formula]].{{Citation needed|date=September 2017}}

However, an arbitrary choice table does not always define a fuzzy logic function. In the paper,&lt;ref &gt; {{ Cite journal | last1 = Zaitsev | first1 = D.A. | author2 = Sarbei, V.G. | author3 = Sleptsov, A.I. | year = 1998 | title = Synthesis of continuous-valued logic functions defined in tabular form | journal = [[Cybernetics and Systems Analysis]] | volume = 34 | issue = 2 | pages = 190– 195 | doi = 10.1007/BF02742068 }} &lt;/ref&gt; a criterion has been formulated to recognize whether a given choice table defines a fuzzy logic function and a simple algorithm of fuzzy logic function synthesis has been proposed based on introduced concepts of constituents of minimum and maximum. A fuzzy logic function represents a disjunction of constituents of minimum, where a constituent of minimum is a conjunction of variables of the current area greater than or equal to the function value in this area (to the right of the function value in the inequality, including the function value).

Another set of AND/OR operators is based on multiplication

&lt;syntaxhighlight lang="text"&gt;
x AND y = x*y
x OR y = 1-(1-x)*(1-y) = x+y-x*y
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;

1-(1-x)*(1-y) comes from this:

&lt;syntaxhighlight lang="text"&gt;
x OR y = NOT( AND( NOT(x), NOT(y) ) )
x OR y = NOT( AND(1-x, 1-y) )
x OR y = NOT( (1-x)*(1-y) )
x OR y = 1-(1-x)*(1-y)
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;

=== IF-THEN rules ===
{{Main|Fuzzy rule}}
IF-THEN rules  map input or computed truth values to desired output truth values. Example:
&lt;syntaxhighlight lang="text"&gt;
IF temperature IS very cold THEN fan_speed is stopped
IF temperature IS cold THEN fan_speed is slow
IF temperature IS warm THEN fan_speed is moderate
IF temperature IS hot THEN fan_speed is high
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;

Given a certain temperature, the fuzzy variable ''hot'' has a certain truth value, which is copied to the ''high'' variable.

Should an output variable occur in several THEN parts, then the values from the respective IF parts are combined using the OR operator.

===Defuzzification===
{{Main|Defuzzification}}
The goal is to get a continuous variable from fuzzy truth values.{{Citation needed|date=September 2017}}

This would be easy if the output truth values were exactly those obtained from fuzzification of a given number.
Since, however, all output truth values are computed independently, in most cases they do not represent such a set of numbers.{{Citation needed|date=September 2017}}
One has then to decide for a number that matches best the "intention" encoded in the truth value.
For example, for several truth values of fan_speed, an actual speed must be found that best fits the computed truth values of the variables 'slow', 'medium' and so on. {{Citation needed | date = September 2017 }}

There is no single algorithm for this purpose.

A common algorithm is
# For each truth value, cut the membership function at this value
# Combine the resulting curves using the OR operator
# Find the center-of-weight of the area under the curve
# The x position of this center is then the final output.

==Forming a consensus of inputs and fuzzy rules==

Since the fuzzy system output is a consensus of all of the inputs and all of the rules, fuzzy logic systems can be well behaved when input values are not available or are not trustworthy. Weightings can be optionally added to each rule in the rulebase and weightings can be used to regulate the degree to which a rule affects the output values. These rule weightings can be based upon the priority, reliability or consistency of each rule. These rule weightings may be static or can be changed dynamically, even based upon the output from other rules.

==Early applications==

Many of the early successful applications of fuzzy logic were implemented in Japan. The first notable application was on the subway train in [[Sendai]], in which fuzzy logic was able to improve the economy, comfort, and precision of the ride.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Kosko|first=B|date=June 1, 1994|title=Fuzzy Thinking:  The New Science of Fuzzy Logic|journal=Hyperion}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has also been used in recognition of hand written symbols in Sony pocket computers, flight aid for helicopters, controlling of subway systems in order to improve driving comfort, precision of halting, and power economy, improved fuel consumption for automobiles, single-button control for washing machines, automatic motor control for vacuum cleaners with recognition of surface condition and degree of soiling, and prediction systems for early recognition of earthquakes through the Institute of Seismology Bureau of Meteorology, Japan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Bansod |first1=Nitin A |last2=Kulkarni |first2=Marshall |last3=Patil |first3=S.H. |editor1-last=Bharati Vidyapeeth College of Engineering |title=Soft Computing |date=2005 |publisher=Allied Publishers |isbn=978-81-7764-632-0 |pages=73 |chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?hl=fr&amp;lr=&amp;id=IkajJC9iGxMC&amp;oi=fnd&amp;pg=PA73&amp;ots=wCguK3mg5U&amp;sig=s0AeSESut1p9dXQriXJG01oJ3ac |accessdate=9 November 2018 |ref=harv |chapter=Soft Computing- A Fuzzy Logic Approach}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Logical analysis ==
In [[mathematical logic]], there are several [[formal system]]s of "fuzzy logic", most of which are in the family of [[t-norm fuzzy logics]].

=== Propositional fuzzy logics ===
The most important propositional fuzzy logics are:
* [[MTL (logic)|Monoidal t-norm-based propositional fuzzy logic]] MTL is an [[Axiomatic system#Axiomatization|axiomatization]] of logic where [[Logical conjunction|conjunction]] is defined by a left continuous [[t-norm]] and implication is defined as the residuum of the t-norm. Its [[structure (mathematical logic)|model]]s correspond to MTL-algebras that are pre-linear commutative bounded integral [[residuated lattice]]s.
* [[BL (logic)|Basic propositional fuzzy logic]] BL is an extension of MTL logic where conjunction is defined by a continuous t-norm, and implication is also defined as the residuum of the t-norm. Its models correspond to BL-algebras.
* [[Lukasiewicz fuzzy logic|Łukasiewicz fuzzy logic]] is the extension of basic fuzzy logic BL where standard conjunction is the Łukasiewicz t-norm. It has the axioms of basic fuzzy logic plus an axiom of double negation, and its models correspond to MV-algebras.
* Gödel fuzzy logic is the extension of basic fuzzy logic BL where conjunction is [[Gödel]] t-norm. It has the axioms of BL plus an axiom of idempotence of conjunction, and its models are called G-algebras.
* Product fuzzy logic is the extension of basic fuzzy logic BL where conjunction is product t-norm. It has the axioms of BL plus another axiom for cancellativity of conjunction, and its models are called product algebras.
* Fuzzy logic with evaluated syntax (sometimes also called Pavelka's logic), denoted by EVŁ, is a further generalization of mathematical fuzzy logic. While the above kinds of fuzzy logic have traditional syntax and many-valued semantics, in EVŁ is evaluated also syntax. This means that each formula has an evaluation. Axiomatization of EVŁ stems from Łukasziewicz fuzzy logic. A generalization of classical Gödel completeness theorem is provable in EVŁ.

=== Predicate fuzzy logics ===
These extend the above-mentioned fuzzy logics by adding [[universal quantifier|universal]] and [[existential quantifier]]s in a manner similar to the way that [[predicate logic]] is created from [[propositional logic]]. The semantics of the universal (resp. existential) quantifier in [[t-norm fuzzy logics]] is the [[infimum]] (resp. [[supremum]]) of the truth degrees of the instances of the quantified subformula.

===Decidability issues for fuzzy logic===
The notions of a "decidable subset" and "[[recursively enumerable]] subset" are basic ones for [[classical mathematics]] and [[classical logic]]. Thus the question of a suitable extension of them to [[fuzzy set theory]] is a crucial one. A first proposal in such a direction was made by E.S. Santos by the notions of ''fuzzy [[Turing machine]]'', ''Markov normal fuzzy algorithm'' and ''fuzzy program'' (see Santos 1970). Successively, L. Biacino and G. Gerla argued that the proposed definitions are rather questionable. For example, in &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Gerla|first=G.|year=2016|title=Comments on some theories of fuzzy computation|url=|journal= International Journal of General Systems|volume=45|issue=4|pages=372–392|doi=10.1080/03081079.2015.1076403}}&lt;/ref&gt; one shows that the fuzzy Turing machines are not  adequate for fuzzy language theory since there are natural fuzzy languages intuitively computable that cannot be recognized by a fuzzy Turing Machine.  Then, they proposed the following definitions. Denote by ''Ü''  the set of rational numbers in [0,1]. Then a fuzzy subset ''s'' : ''S'' &lt;math&gt;\rightarrow&lt;/math&gt;[0,1] of a set ''S'' is recursively enumerable if a recursive map ''h'' : ''S''×''N'' &lt;math&gt;\rightarrow&lt;/math&gt;''Ü'' exists such that, for every ''x'' in ''S'', the function ''h''(''x'',''n'') is increasing with respect to ''n'' and ''s''(''x'') = lim ''h''(''x'',''n'').
We say that ''s'' is ''decidable'' if both ''s'' and its complement –''s'' are recursively enumerable. An extension of such a theory to the general case of the L-subsets is possible (see Gerla 2006).
The proposed definitions are well related with fuzzy logic. Indeed, the following theorem holds true (provided that the deduction apparatus of the considered fuzzy logic satisfies some obvious effectiveness property).

Any "axiomatizable" fuzzy theory is recursively enumerable. In particular, the [[fuzzy set]] of logically true formulas is recursively enumerable in spite of the fact that the crisp set of valid formulas is not recursively enumerable, in general. Moreover, any axiomatizable and complete theory is decidable.

It is an open question to give supports for a "Church thesis" for [[fuzzy mathematics]], the proposed notion of recursive enumerability for fuzzy subsets is the adequate one. In order to solve this, an extension of the notions of fuzzy grammar and fuzzy [[Turing machine]] are necessary. Another open question is to start from this notion to find an extension of [[Gödel]]'s theorems to fuzzy logic.

==Fuzzy databases==
Once fuzzy relations are defined, it is possible to develop fuzzy [[relational database]]s. The first fuzzy relational database, FRDB, appeared in [[Maria Zemankova]]'s dissertation (1983). Later, some other models arose like the Buckles-Petry model, the Prade-Testemale Model, the Umano-Fukami model or the GEFRED model by J.M. Medina, M.A. Vila et al.

Fuzzy querying languages have been defined, such as the [[SQLf]] by P. Bosc et al. and the [[FSQL]] by J. Galindo et al. These languages define some structures in order to include fuzzy aspects in the SQL statements, like fuzzy conditions, fuzzy comparators, fuzzy constants, fuzzy constraints, fuzzy thresholds, linguistic labels etc.

==Comparison to probability==
Fuzzy logic and probability address different forms of uncertainty. While both fuzzy logic and probability theory can represent degrees of certain kinds of subjective belief, [[fuzzy set theory]] uses the concept of fuzzy set membership, i.e., how much an observation is within a vaguely defined set, and probability theory uses the concept of [[subjective probability]], i.e., likelihood of some event or condition. The concept of fuzzy sets was developed in the mid-twentieth century at Berkeley &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www2.eecs.berkeley.edu/Faculty/Homepages/zadeh.html |title=Lofti Zadeh Berkeley |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170211080227/https://www2.eecs.berkeley.edu/Faculty/Homepages/zadeh.html |archivedate=2017-02-11 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; as a response to the lacking of probability theory for jointly modelling uncertainty and [[vagueness]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |url=http://www.scholarpedia.org/article/Fuzzy_sets |title=Fuzzy Sets |journal=Scholarpedia |volume=1 |issue=10 |pages=2031 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090413125658/http://www.scholarpedia.org/article/Fuzzy_sets |archivedate=2009-04-13 |df= |doi=10.4249/scholarpedia.2031 |year=2006 |last1=Mares |first1=Milan }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Bart Kosko]] claims in Fuzziness vs. Probability&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Kosko |first1=Bart |authorlink1=Bart Kosko |title=Fuzziness vs. Probability |url=http://sipi.usc.edu/~kosko/Fuzziness_Vs_Probability.pdf |publisher=University of South California |accessdate=9 November 2018 |ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; that probability theory is a subtheory of fuzzy logic, as questions of degrees of belief in mutually-exclusive set membership in probability theory can be represented as certain cases of non-mutually-exclusive graded membership in fuzzy theory. In that context, he also derives [[Bayes' theorem]] from the concept of fuzzy subsethood. [[Lotfi A. Zadeh]] argues that fuzzy logic is different in character from probability, and is not a replacement for it. He fuzzified probability to fuzzy probability and also generalized it to [[possibility theory]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Novák | first1 = V | year = 2005 | title = Are fuzzy sets a reasonable tool for modeling vague phenomena? | url = | journal = Fuzzy Sets and Systems | volume = 156 | issue = 3| pages = 341–348 | doi=10.1016/j.fss.2005.05.029}}&lt;/ref&gt;

More generally, fuzzy logic is one of many different extensions to classical logic intended to deal with issues of uncertainty outside of the scope of classical logic, the inapplicability of probability theory in many domains, and the paradoxes of [[Dempster-Shafer theory]].

==Relation to ecorithms==
Computational theorist [[Leslie Valiant]] uses the term ''ecorithms'' to describe how many less exact systems and techniques like fuzzy logic (and "less robust" logic) can be applied to [[learning algorithms]]. Valiant essentially redefines machine learning as evolutionary. In general use, ecorithms are algorithms that learn from their more complex environments (hence ''eco-'') to generalize, approximate and simplify solution logic. Like fuzzy logic, they are methods used to overcome continuous variables or systems too complex to completely enumerate or understand discretely or exactly. &lt;!-- See in particular p.&amp;nbsp;58 of the reference comparing induction/invariance, robust, mathematical and other logical limits in computing, where techniques including fuzzy logic and natural data selection (à la "computational Darwinism") can be used to short-cut computational complexity and limits in a "practical" way (such as the brake temperature example in this article). --&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Valiant, Leslie |title=Probably Approximately Correct: Nature's Algorithms for Learning and Prospering in a Complex World |date=2013 |publisher=Basic Books |location=New York |isbn=978-0465032716 |ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ecorithms and fuzzy logic also have the common property of dealing with possibilities more than probabilities, although feedback and [[feed forward (control)|feed forward]], basically stochastic weights, are a feature of both when dealing with, for example, dynamical systems.

== Compensatory fuzzy logic ==

Compensatory fuzzy logic (CFL) is a branch of fuzzy logic with modified rules for conjunction and disjunction. When the truth value of one component of a conjunction or disjunction is increased or decreased, the other component is decreased or increased to compensate. This increase or decrease in truth value may be offset by the increase or decrease in another component. An offset may be blocked when certain thresholds are met. Proponents{{who|date=July 2015}} claim that CFL allows for better computational semantic behaviors and mimic natural language.{{vague|date=July 2015}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://web.mit.edu/6.863/www/fall2012/projects/writeups/semantic-similarity-betweenverbs.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-10-02 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151004060002/http://web.mit.edu/6.863/www/fall2012/projects/writeups/semantic-similarity-betweenverbs.pdf |archivedate=2015-10-04 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Veri|first=Francesco|year=2017|title=Fuzzy Multiple Attribute Conditions in fsQCA: Problems and Solutions|url=|journal= Sociological Methods &amp; Research|pages=004912411772969|doi=10.1177/0049124117729693}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Compensatory Fuzzy Logic consists of four continuous operators: conjunction (c); disjunction (d); fuzzy strict order (or); and negation (n). The conjunction is the geometric mean and its dual as conjunctive and disjunctive operators.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Cejas |first1=Jesús |title=Compensatory Fuzzy Logic |journal=Revista de Ingeniería Industrial |date=2011 |issn=1815-5936}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== IEEE STANDARD 1855–2016 – IEEE Standard for Fuzzy Markup Language ==

The [[IEEE 1855]], the IEEE STANDARD 1855–2016, is about a specification language named [[Fuzzy markup language|Fuzzy Markup Language]] (FML)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Acampora |first1=Giovanni |last2=Di Stefano |first2=Bruno N. |last3=Vitiello |first3=Autilia |title=IEEE 1855™: The First IEEE Standard Sponsored by IEEE Computational Intelligence Society [Society Briefs] |journal=IEEE Comp.Int.

FML allows modelling a fuzzy logic system in a human-readable and hardware independent way. FML is based on eXtensible Markup Language ([[XML]]). The designers of fuzzy systems with FML have a unified and high-level methodology for describing interoperable fuzzy systems. IEEE STANDARD 1855–2016 uses the [[W3C]] [[XML Schema]] definition language to define the syntax and semantics of the FML programs.

Prior to the introduction of FML, fuzzy logic practitioners could exchange information about their fuzzy algorithms by &amp;nbsp;adding to their software functions the ability to read, correctly parse, and store the results of their work in a &amp;nbsp;form compatible with the [[Fuzzy Control Language]] (FCL) described and specified by Part 7 of [[IEC 61131]].&lt;ref name="Di Stefano2013"&gt;{{Cite book|last1=Di Stefano|first1=Bruno N.|title=On the Power of Fuzzy Markup Language|volume=296|year=2013|pages=3–15|issn=1434-9922|doi=10.1007/978-3-642-35488-5_1|series=Studies in Fuzziness and Soft Computing|isbn=978-3-642-35487-8|chapter=On the Need of a Standard Language for Designing Fuzzy Systems}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="AcamporaLoia2013"&gt;{{Cite book|last1=Acampora|first1=Giovanni|last2=Loia|first2=Vincenzo|last3=Lee|first3=Chang-Shing|last4=Wang|first4=Mei-Hui| title= On the Power of Fuzzy Markup Language|volume=296|year=2013|issn=1434-9922|doi=10.1007/978-3-642-35488-5|series=Studies in Fuzziness and Soft Computing|isbn=978-3-642-35487-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="19824">{{main article|International Date Line}}
The '''international date line&lt;ref group="note"&gt;In this article, the convention used is to capitalize "Date Line" (or "International Date Line") when it refers to the ''standard'' [[International Date Line]], but to use small letters to refer to possible construct(s) under Jewish law.&lt;/ref&gt;  in Judaism''' is used to demarcate the change of one calendar day to the next in the [[Hebrew calendar|Jewish calendar]]. The Jewish calendar defines days as running from sundown to sundown rather than midnight to midnight. So in the context of Judaism, an international date line demarcates when the line of sundown moving across the Earth's surface stops being the sundown ending and starting one day and starts being the sundown ending and starting the following day.

However, the conventional [[International Date Line]] is a relatively recent geographic and political construct whose exact location has moved from time to time depending on the needs of different interested parties. While it is well-understood why the conventional date line is located in the Pacific Ocean, there are not really objective criteria for its exact placement within the Pacific.&lt;ref&gt;See the [[International Date Line|main article]] for details.&lt;/ref&gt; In that light, it cannot be taken for granted that the conventional International Date Line can (or should) be used as a date line under Jewish law. In practice, within Judaism the ''[[Jewish law|halakhic]]'' date line is similar to, but not necessarily identical with, the conventional Date Line, and the differences can have consequences under religious law.

==Location of the date line==

===Theoretical basis for the discussion===
Many of the opinions about the ''halakhic'' date line are structured as a response to the question of what days someone should observe as [[Shabbat]] and [[Jewish holidays]]. Shabbat occurs every seven days at any location on earth. It is normally thought to occur on Saturday—or more precisely, from Friday at sundown to Saturday at nightfall. But if the ''halakhic'' date line is not identical to the conventional Date Line, it is possible that what is Saturday with respect to the conventional Date Line is not Saturday with respect to the ''halakhic'' date line, at least in some places.

There are several opinions regarding where exactly the ''halakhic'' date line should be according to Jewish law, and at least one opinion that says that no ''halakhic'' date line really exists.&lt;ref name=kashrus/&gt;&lt;ref name=chabad/&gt;&lt;ref name="taarich"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Taplin |first1=Rabbi Yisroel |authorlink1=Yisroel Taplin |title=Sefer Taarich Yisroel |date=1998–1999 |location=Lakewood, NJ |url=http://www.datelineinhalacha.com/dateline_in_halacha.html |language=Hebrew|postscript=,}} which is summarized in English at {{cite web |title=Kitzur Taarich Yisroel: The Dateline in Halacha |url=http://www.datelineinhalacha.com/dateline_in_halacha.html |website=www.datelineinhalacha |accessdate=30 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=map&gt;[http://www.star-k.org/articles/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/IDL_Map.pdf The International Dateline in Halacha (Star-K)(map)], 170 kB&lt;/ref&gt;

{{anchor|90}}'''1. ''90 degrees east of Jerusalem.''''' The concept of a ''halakhic'' date line is mentioned in the ''[[Baal HaMeor]],'' a 12th-century Talmudic commentary,&lt;ref name=kashrus&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.star-k.org/articles/kashrus-kurrents/493/a-travelers-guide-to-the-international-dateline/ |last=Heber|first=Rabbi Dovid|title=A Traveller's Guide To The International Dateline |publisher=Star-k.org |accessdate=26 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=chabad/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Rabbeinu Zecharya Halevi, ''Baal Hameor'', Tractate Rosh Hashana, 20b&lt;/ref&gt; which seems to indicate that the day changes in an area where the time is six hours ahead of [[Jerusalem]] (90 degrees east of Jerusalem, about 125.2°E, a line now known to run through [[Australia]], the [[Philippines]], [[China]] and [[Russia]]). This line, which he refers to as the ''K'tzai Hamizrach'' (the easternmost line), is used to calculate the day of [[Rosh Hashanah]], the Jewish New Year. According to some sources it is alluded to in both the [[Babylonian Talmud]] ([[Rosh Hashanah (tractate)|Rosh Hashanah]] and [[Eruvin (Talmud)|Eruvin]]) and in the [[Jerusalem Talmud]].  The ''[[Kuzari]]'' of [[Yehuda Halevi]], also a 12th-century work, seems to agree with this ruling.

Later decisors like the ''[[Chazon Ish]]'' (twentieth century) fundamentally agree with this ruling. However, they recognize practical issues associated with the pure use of a line of longitude for this purpose. As an example, 125.2°E passes directly through Dongfeng Street in [[Changchun]], China.&lt;ref&gt;To be precise, at a point 1.11 km east of Xihu Rd. See [https://www.openstreetmap.org/search?query=43.84%2C125.2#map=12/43.8400/125.1999 location on OpenStreetMaps.]&lt;/ref&gt; If this line of longitude were used strictly, people could simply avoid Shabbat altogether by crossing the street. To prevent that, the Chazon Ish rules{{refn|Cited in Taplin&lt;ref name="taarich /&gt; at footnote 16 of the web page.}}&lt;ref name="RJJ"&gt;This is rejected by the [[Yitzchok Zev Soloveitchik|Brisker Rav]] (see {{cite journal|last1=Pahmer|first1=David|title=The International Date Line and Related Issues|journal=RJJ Journal of Halacha and Contemporary Society|date=1990|volume=XXI|pages=60–83|url=http://download2.yutorah.org/1991/1053/735807.pdf|accessdate=27 April 2016|postscript=}} at page 69), who rules that the use of this meridian is absolute.&lt;/ref&gt; that the contiguous land masses to the east of that line of longitude are considered secondary (''tafel'') to the land masses west of that line. As a result, he rules that the date line runs along 125.2°E when over water, but curves around the eastern coast of mainland Asia and Australia. By this view, Russia, China and Australia are west of the date line and observe Shabbat on local Saturday. [[Japan]], [[New Zealand]] and [[Tasmania]] are east of the date line and should observe Shabbat on local Sunday, as defined by the conventional International Date Line. By this view, the Philippines and [[Indonesia]] would have portions west of the line and portions east of the line.&lt;ref name=kashrus/&gt;&lt;ref name=chabad/&gt;

'''2. ''180 degrees east of Jerusalem.''''' Rabbi [[Yechiel Michel Tucazinsky]] ruled that the International Date Line is 180 degrees east of Jerusalem.  That would mean that the date line, rather than being near 180°, would be at 144.8°W.  By this view, places east of the conventional International Date Line but west of 144.8°W—[[Alaska]], [[Hawaii]] and a variety of archipelagos in the Pacific—would observe Shabbat on the local Friday instead of the local Saturday.

It is possible (but not certain) under this view to apply the principal of ''tafel'' described above as well. In that event, mainland Alaska would be east of the date line, but the [[Aleutian Islands]] would be west of the date line.&lt;ref name=kashrus/&gt;&lt;ref name=chabad/&gt;

'''3. ''Mid-Pacific.''''' A variety of decisors{{refn|''Inter alia,'' Rabbis David Shapira, B. Rabinowitz Thumim, the ''Atzei Sodeh,'' and the ''Alai Yonah.'' These decisors do not necessarily rule identically to each other.&lt;ref name=kashrus/&gt;&lt;ref name=chabad&gt;{{cite web|last1=Shurpin|first1=Rabbi Yehuda|title=The Sabbath, the International Date Line and Jewish Law|url=http://www.chabad.org/library/article_cdo/aid/1736567/jewish/|website=Chabad.org|publisher=Chabad-Lubavitch|accessdate=26 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;}} rule that the date line runs in the middle of the Pacific Ocean, close to (but not necessarily the same as) the conventional International Date Line. According to this point of view, all of the major populated areas of the Pacific (such as New Zealand, Japan, Alaska and Hawaii) observe Shabbat on local Saturday (that is, consistent with the conventional International Date Line). Only certain Pacific islands, generally having few or no permanent Jewish residents, might not observe Shabbat on local Saturday.&lt;ref name=map/&gt;

'''4. ''Following local custom/There is no fixed date line.''''' According to Rabbi [[Menachem Mendel Kasher]], there is no clear tradition or Talmudic source dictating any of the preceding opinions as binding. For that reason, and consistent with a [[History of responsa in Judaism|responsum]] of the [[Radbaz]], Rabbi Kasher starts with the default law that a Jew not knowing the proper day for Shabbat should count days from the last time s/he observed Shabbat, and that every seven days is Shabbat. In his view, established Jewish communities are presumed to have fixed their calendars according to this principle. Therefore, Shabbat in an established community is whatever day the community has established. Rabbi [[Isser Zalman Meltzer]] and Rabbi [[Zvi Pesach Frank]] apparently agree with this position.&lt;ref name=chabad/&gt;&lt;ref name=gewirtz&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Gewirtz|first1=William L.|title=Zemannim: On the Introduction of New Constructs in Halakhah|journal=The Torah U-Madda Journal|date=2012–13|volume=16|pages=153–172|jstor=23596060}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|155}} This position does not in and of itself require a formal date line to be established, and Rabbi Kasher does not seem to think that it is necessary to do so. But the ''de facto'' result of this position is consistent with the conventional International Date Line, at least anywhere there is an established Jewish community.&lt;ref name=chabad/&gt;{{refn|Rabbi Shurpin&lt;ref name=chabad/&gt;{{rp|Note 14}} and Gewirtz&lt;ref name=gewirtz/&gt;{{rp|Note 4}} provide treatments as to how [[International Date Line#Historical alterations|changes in the location of the International Date Line]] might affect its use as a ''de facto'' standard in Jewish Law.}}

===Practical rulings===
In practice, the conventional International Date Line (or another mid-Pacific line near it) is the ''de facto'' date line under Jewish law, at least for established Jewish communities. The communities of Japan,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jccjapan.or.jp/ Jewish Community of Japan], [http://www.jcckobe.org/ Jewish Community of Kansai]&lt;/ref&gt; New Zealand,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.chc.org.nz/ Canterbury Hebrew Congregation], [http://ahc.org.nz/category/events/ Auckland Hebrew Congregation]&lt;/ref&gt; Hawaii,&lt;ref&gt;[http://sofmaarav.org/ Congregation Sof Maarav], [http://www.mauijews.org/#!events/c17et Jewish Congregation of Maui]&lt;/ref&gt; and [[French Polynesia]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Harris|first1=Andrew|title=Shabbat in Tahiti paradise|url=http://www.jewishnews.net.au/shabbat-in-tahiti-paradise/14535|accessdate=27 April 2016|work=The Australian Jewish News|date=July 28, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; all observe Shabbat on local Saturday ''(i.e.,'' Friday night until Saturday night). No known Jewish community observes Shabbat on a day other than local Saturday.&lt;ref name=jta&gt;The one arguable exception is [[Samoa]], which moved from the east side of the International Date Line to the west side around New Year's Day 2012. The [[Jewish Telegraphic Agency]] located one relatively observant Jewish individual living on Samoa, who said at the time that he would follow the lead of local [[Seventh-Day Adventist]] churches and light Shabbat candles on Saturday night. (See {{cite news|last1=Soclof|first1=Adam|title=Samoa time warps into Shabbat|url=http://www.jta.org/2012/01/03/the-archive-blog/samoa-time-warps-into-shabbat|accessdate=27 April 2016|agency=Jewish Telegraphic Agency|date=3 January 2012|postscript=.)}} However, the practice of a single individual may not be sufficient to establish a community practice in Jewish law.&lt;/ref&gt; However, that practical conclusion is reached in two different ways, resulting in somewhat different practice patterns in each case.

'''''Following local custom/There is no fixed date line.''''' As noted above, according to this point of view, Shabbat is simply observed on the date previously established as Shabbat by the local community—uniformly, local Saturday&lt;ref name=jta/&gt;—without any need for any further observance. This appears to be the default practice for residents of such places as Japan, New Zealand and Hawaii. At minimum, it is difficult to find evidence of other practices by residents of those areas.&lt;ref name=worker&gt;See, as an anecdotal example, {{cite web|title=The international dateline and halacha|url=http://jewishworker.blogspot.com/2005/09/international-dateline-and-halacha.html|website=The Jewish Worker|accessdate=27 April 2016|postscript=;}} search the page for "NZ".&lt;!--This is a blog, and the pertinent comment was in the responses, not in the blog post itself. As a source, it doesn't really qualify as a RS, and it is intended to be illustrative, rather than definitive. But there is little in the way of reliable evidence, which is not surprising given that one is essentially trying to prove a negative.--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;{{refn|Taken to a fully logical conclusion, ''no fixed date line'' means that anyone in a location without an established tradition of which day is Shabbat should always depend on his own personal count of days. It is not clear whether this can currently apply to someone traveling on his or her own to an island in the Western Pacific without an established tradition. (See, for example, Rabbi Shurpin {{refn|name=chabad}} at the end of the section "The Samoa issue".) However, it seems clear that at minimum one construes an "established community" relatively broadly. So while Japan, for example, has only a scattered handful of synagogues, their uniform practice of observing Shabbat on Saturday seems sufficient to fix Saturday as the established day for Shabbat anywhere in Japan.}}

'''''Establishment of a date line by a majority among three halakhic positions.''''' The travelers' guide of the [[Star-K]] kosher supervision service, compiled according to the rulings of its rabbinic administrator, Rabbi [[Moshe Heinemann]], uses the following approach,&lt;ref name=kashrus/&gt; which is also cited by others. According to this approach, the [[#90|first three numbered sections above]] constitute three valid, parallel, ''halakhic'' rulings. Shabbat is consequently fully observed on whichever day is consistent with the majority view among those opinions (two out of three). However, out of respect to the minority view of the third ruling, and with an eye toward not desecrating Shabbat, [[Melacha|Torah-level prohibitions]] are to be avoided on the day consistent with the minority view, although that day is otherwise considered a weekday. According to this rule, practice is as follows: 
* In New Zealand and Japan, the local Saturday is Shabbat according to the majority opinion (sections 2 and 3 above), and it should therefore be fully observed as Shabbat. However, since according to the minority opinion (section 1 above), Shabbat is on the local Sunday, one should not perform any Torah-level Shabbat prohibitions on Sunday. Nevertheless, on Sunday, one should pray the regular weekday prayers, donning [[tefillin]] during morning prayers.
* In Hawaii and French Polynesia, the local Saturday is Shabbat according to majority opinion (sections 1 and 3 above), and it should therefore be fully observed as Shabbat. However, since according to the minority opinion (section 2 above), Shabbat is on the local Friday, one should not perform any Torah-level Shabbat prohibitions on Friday. Friday prayers are weekday prayers, and preparation for Shabbat must be done with an eye to avoiding Torah-level Shabbat prohibitions.&lt;ref name=kashrus/&gt; 
* In principle, a zone of pure doubt exists in approximately the area of 169°W–177°E,&lt;ref name=map/&gt; including places like [[Tonga]], Samoa and [[American Samoa]]. The rulings of the ''Mid-Pacific'' group above are not perfectly consistent in this area,&lt;ref name=kashrus/&gt; so there is no possibility of an unambiguous "two out of three" consensus here. Rabbi Dovid Heber of the Star-K suggests that in such locations one might need to observe Shabbat fully for two days every week.&lt;ref name="heber2"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Heber|first1=Rabbi Dovid|title=How to Keep This Shabbos in Samoa? STAR-K Tells Us How (Samoa &amp; Tokelau To Cross International Date Line)|url=http://www.theyeshivaworld.com/news/headlines-breaking-stories/113307/how-to-keep-this-shabbos-in-samoa-star-k-tells-us-how-samoa-tokelau-to-cross-international-date-line.html|website=The Yeshiva World News|accessdate=27 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The Star-K's international kosher supervision staff follows this approach, and there is evidence that some other travelers also do.&lt;ref name=worker/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=International Dateline|url=http://comments.gmane.org/gmane.culture.religion.jewish.avodah/26561|website=avodah@aishdas.com|accessdate=27 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Authorities suggesting this approach often advise travelers to avoid the zone of doubt entirely near weekends, or to consult with a competent rabbinical authority directly.&lt;ref name=heber2/&gt;

==Crossing the halakhic date line==
The issues discussed in the previous section apply ''per se'' to individuals or communities in fixed locations. However, the act of crossing the date line (wherever it may be drawn) introduces a number of additional issues under Jewish law. Questions potentially affected include:&lt;ref name=kashrus/&gt;
{{div col}}
*Crossing the line into or out of Shabbat or a holiday, or a [[Ta'anit|rabbinic fast day]], while already aboard an airplane or a ship
*Determining what prayers to say (and when) while in transit
*Lighting candles on [[Hanukkah]]
*[[Counting of the Omer]], and consequently fixing the day for [[Shavuot]]
*[[Niddah|Counting days until relations are permitted following menstruation]]
*Fixing the date for [[Brit Milah]], [[Pidyon Haben]] or [[Bar and Bat Mitzvah]]
{{div col end}}
In some cases, crossing the date line (wherever it may be drawn) has a specific impact on practice or prohibitions under Jewish law. In others, an individual's count of days (by the experience of sunset and sunrise) is the determining factor, regardless of the crossing of the date line. Details around specific questions, cases and rulings of Jewish law are beyond the scope of this article.{{refn|See Taplin&lt;ref name="taarich" /&gt;, which covers these questions in some detail. The author notes that there are consensus opinions about some—but not all—of these issues.}}

==Considerations for astronauts==
Before Israeli astronaut [[Ilan Ramon]] flew on the [[Space Shuttle Columbia|Space Shuttle ''Columbia'']] in 2003, he decided (after consultation with rabbis) to observe Shabbat according to time in his last residence, [[Kennedy Space Center|Cape Canaveral]], since he would be crossing the date line and observing sunset many times per day.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Ask the rabbi: Shabbat in space|date=18 January 2003|website=ohr.edu|publisher=[[Ohr Somayach, Jerusalem]]|url=https://ohr.edu/explore_judaism/ask_the_rabbi/ask_the_rabbi/637|accessdate=2017-04-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|work=[[Jewish Virtual Library]]|title=Ilan Ramon|url=http://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/ilan-ramon|date=February 2, 2003|accessdate=2017-04-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=standard /&gt; [[Judith Resnik]], the first American Jewish astronaut in space, lit (electronic) Shabbat candles according to the time in [[Johnson Space Center|Houston, TX]], her home and the location of [[Christopher C.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="14717">An '''international medical graduate''' ('''IMG'''), earlier known as a '''foreign medical graduate''' ('''FMG'''), is a [[physician]] who has graduated from a medical school outside of the country where he or she intends to practice. Generally, the medical school of graduation is one listed in the [[International Medical Education Directory]] (IMED) as accredited by the [[Foundation for Advancement of International Medical Education and Research]] or the [[World Health Organization]].

Medical schools around the world vary in education standards, curricula, and evaluation methods. Many countries have their own certification program, equivalent to the ECFMG in the United States. The purpose of [[ECFMG]] Certification is to assess the readiness of international medical graduates to enter clinical specialty training programs as [[resident physician]]s and fellowship programs in the United States.

== License requirements by country ==

The requirements to obtain a license to practice varies by country and often by state or province.

===Australia===
{{main article|Overseas trained doctors in Australia}}

IMGs (or Overseas Trained Doctors) who wish to be licensed in [[Australia]] must apply to the [[Australian Medical Council|Australian Medical Council (AMC)]] to arrange an appropriate assessment pathway.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.amc.org.au/index.php/pub/downloads/359-applying-to-amc|title=IMG guides:   Applying to the Australian Medical Council| publisher= Australian Medical Council |date=27 February 2012 |accessdate=7 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The standard pathway involves an IMG sitting a series of assessments, including AMC MCQ Exam and AMC clinical exam.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.amc.org.au/index.php/ass/apo/sp |title= Assessments &amp; examinations: Standard pathway| publisher= Australian Medical Council |date=27 February 2012 |accessdate=7 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; AMC MCQ Exam consists of 150 MCQs organized through computer adaptive scoring.

For AMC clinical exam, a candidate is required to pass 12 out of 16 cases including one compulsory case in each of Gyne and pediatrics.

Those IMGs who have passed the necessary exams and obtained AMC certification can then apply to an Australian specialty training positions.[https://web.archive.org/web/20080613222254/http://www.amc.org.au/prelim1.asp]

Australia is in the process of establishing a national registration process for all the doctors under Medical Board of Australia.

In 2010 the [[Minister for Health and Ageing (Australia)]] launched an [[Inquiry process into registration and accreditation processes for international medical graduates]] which reported in 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.aph.gov.au/Parliamentary_Business/Committees/House_of_Representatives_Committees?url=haa/overseasdoctors/report.htm | title=Inquiry into Registration Processes and Support for Overseas Trained Doctors | publisher= Parliament of Australia | accessdate=2 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Canada===
Several organizations have put pressure on the government such as the Association For Access to Health Care Services, and Association of International Physicians and Surgeons of [[Ontario]]. Bill 97, Increasing Access to Qualified Health Professionals for Ontarians Act, was passed in 2008, requiring the [[Royal College of Physicians and Surgeons of Canada|College of Physicians and Surgeons]] to provide adequate numbers of doctors by issuing transitional licenses. However, the college has not complied with the law.

In addition to undergoing the regular licensing process as required of all Canadian medical school graduates, IMGs must pass the [[Licentiate of the Medical Council of Canada|LMCC]] Evaluating Examination. IMGs in Canada also have a harder time getting into residency programs compared to Canadian graduates &amp;mdash; only ten percent of IMG applicants get a position.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.readersdigest.ca/health/healthy-living/why-canada-shutting-out-doctors readersdigest.ca - Why Is Canada Shutting Out Doctors?]: "In 2003, 625 international graduates competed. Only 67—about ten percent—found a position"&lt;/ref&gt;

Graduates of United States M.D. programs are ''not'' considered IMGs and are thus exempt from the Evaluating Examination; graduates of U.S. osteopathic medical schools ''are'' considered IMGs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mcc.ca/en/exams/ee/apply.shtml |title=Evaluating Examination: Apply |publisher=Medical Council of Canada |accessdate=2010-04-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===United States===
{{update section|date=December 2017}}
[[Image:2007ACGME-2.PNG|250px|right]][[Image:2007ACGME-3.PNG|250px|right]]
Graduates of Canadian M.D. programs are ''not'' considered IMGs in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ecfmg.org/2010ib/ibfaq.html |title=Frequently Asked Questions: 1. What Is ECFMG Certification? |work=2010 ECFMG Information Booklet |publisher=Educational Commission for Foreign Medical Graduates |accessdate=2010-04-16 |quote=Medical schools outside the United States and Canada vary in their educational standards and curricula. The purpose of ECFMG Certification is to assess whether graduates of these schools are ready to enter U.S. residency and fellowship programs that are accredited by the Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education (ACGME).}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Indian physician with an [[Bachelor of Medicine, Bachelor of Surgery|MBBS]] are qualified to take the [[United States Medical Licensing Examination|USMLE]]. However, since the 2010s, the process of obtaining a license was becoming increasingly complicated&lt;ref&gt;https://www.nytimes.com/2013/08/12/business/economy/long-slog-for-foreign-doctors-to-practice-in-us.html&lt;/ref&gt; India has exported more physicians to the United States than any other foreign nation.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=16774871&lt;/ref&gt;

====Pathway====
The main pathway for IMGs who wish to be licensed as physicians in the [[United States]] is to complete a U.S. [[residency (medicine)|residency]] hospital program. The general method to apply for residency programs is through the [[National Resident Matching Program]] (abbreviated NRMP, also called "the Match"). To participate in the NRMP, an IMG is required to have an [[ECFMG certification]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nrmp.org/res_match/special_part/ind_app/verif_new.html nrmp.org &gt; Independent Applicants] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110721084648/http://www.nrmp.org/res_match/special_part/ind_app/verif_new.html |date=2011-07-21 }} Updated 09/08/2010.&lt;/ref&gt; by the "rank order list certification deadline" time (usually in February of the year of the match).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nrmp.org/res_match/yearly.html nrmp.org &gt; 2012 Main Match Schedule] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110716035954/http://www.nrmp.org/res_match/yearly.html |date=2011-07-16 }} Updated 05/19/2011&lt;/ref&gt; To acquire an ECFMG certification, the main requirements are:&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ecfmg.org/2011ib/ibmec.html ecfmg.org &gt; Medical Education Credentials] Last update: September 15, 2010&lt;/ref&gt; 
*Completion of [[USMLE Step 1]], [[USMLE Step 2 Clinical Knowledge]] and [[USMLE Step 2 Clinical Skills]]
*A medical diploma of [[medical education]] taken at an institution registered in the [[International Medical Education Directory]] (IMED)
In comparison, regular graduates from medical schools in the United States and Canada need to complete USMLE Steps 1 and 2 as well, but can participate in the NRMP while still doing their final year of medical school before acquiring their medical diplomas.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nrmp.org/res_match/special_part/us_seniors/registration.html nrmp.org &gt; U.S. Seniors &gt; Registering with the NRMP] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110721084824/http://www.nrmp.org/res_match/special_part/us_seniors/registration.html |date=2011-07-21 }} Updated August 2010&lt;/ref&gt; In effect, taking regular administrative delays into account, and with residency programs starting around July, there is a gap of at least half a year for IMGs between graduation from medical school and beginning of a residency program.

Those IMGs who have passed the necessary [[USMLE]] exams and obtained the ECFMG certification can then apply to U.S. residency positions via the [[NRMP]] and [[Electronic Residency Application Service|ERAS]].

USMLE exam scores are considered in the [[National Resident Matching Program#International medical graduates|matching process]] for entering a residency program.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|author=Catherine Rampell|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/08/12/business/economy/long-slog-for-foreign-doctors-to-practice-in-us.html|title=Path to United States Practice Is Long Slog to Foreign Doctors|publisher=New York Times|date=August 11, 2018|access-date=July 22, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; One study came to the result that almost half of IMGs were unsuccessful in their first attempts in the pursuit of a U.S. residency position, and three-quarters began a residency after five years.&lt;ref name=jolly2011&gt;[http://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/742193?src=mp&amp;spon=25 Participation in U.S. Graduate Medical Education by Graduates of International Medical Schools] By Jolly, Paul PhD; Boulet, John PhD; Garrison, Gwen PhD; Signer, Mona M. MPH. Posted: 05/23/2011; ''Academic Medicine''. 2011;86(5):559-564.&lt;/ref&gt; It also indicated that IMGs were considerably older when they first applied for a residency position than are most U.S. medical graduates, with mean age of IMGs when the ECFMG certificate was issued being 32.4 years, with a standard deviation of 5.8 years.&lt;ref name=jolly2011/&gt;

All applicants to residency programs in [[California]] need a ''{{visible anchor|Postgraduate Training Authorization Letter}}'' (PTAL), colloquially called a "California Letter".&lt;ref&gt;[http://ö/www.ecfmg.org/eras/applicants-documents-pta.html Postgraduate Training Authorization Letter (PTAL) or “California Letter”], [[Educational Commission for Foreign Medical Graduates]]. Last updated June 4, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; Obtainment of a PTAL requires graduation from a [[medical school]] listed by the Medical Board of California, which is more stringent than the [[International Medical Education Directory]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://fm.mednet.ucla.edu/IMG/residency/PTAL.asp University of California, Los Angeles - PTAL], Updated January 2011&lt;/ref&gt; It also requires having a [[Social Security number]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mbc.ca.gov/Applicants/Physicians_and_Surgeons/#8 The Medical Board of California - Physicians and Surgeons]. Retrieved May 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

Concerning [[United States visa|visa]] requirements, non-U.S.-citizen doctors usually enter via the J1 or the H-1B visa. The J1 reqires a 2-year home residence after completion of training in the U.S.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.ama-assn.org/life-career/immigration-information-international-medical-graduates|title=Immigration Information for International Medical Graduates|publisher=American Medical Association|access-date=July 22, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The H-1B visa does not have this 2-year home residence requirement, but further requires the [[USMLE Step 3]]. And initially, a B-1 visitor visa is required for taking the USMLE Step 2 clinical skills examination and the USMLE Step 3.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.seak.com/blog/uncategorized/10-biggest-immigration-mistakes-physicians-make/|title=The 10 Biggest Immigration Mistakes Physicians Make|website=www.seak.com|access-date=July 22, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Quality of care==
One study examining quality of care by international medical graduates is noted as follows.  "One-quarter of practicing physicians in the United States are graduates of international medical schools. The quality of care provided by doctors educated abroad has been the subject of ongoing concern. Our analysis of 244,153 hospitalizations in Pennsylvania found that patients of doctors who graduated from international medical schools and were not U.S. citizens at the time they entered medical school had significantly lower mortality rates than patients cared for by doctors who graduated from U.S. medical schools or who were U.S. citizens and received their degrees abroad. The patient population consisted of those with congestive heart failure or acute myocardial infarction. We found no significant mortality difference when comparing all international medical graduates with all U.S. medical school graduates".&lt;ref name=Norcini_1467&gt;{{Harvnb|Norcini|2010|pp=1467}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Data on older Medicare patients admitted to hospital in the US showed that patients treated by international graduates had lower mortality than patients cared for by US graduates.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bmj.com/content/356/bmj.j273 |title=Quality of care delivered by general internists in US hospitals who graduated from foreign versus US medical schools: observational study |publisher=BMJ |date=3 February 2017| doi=10.1136/bmj.j273}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Ioffe Physical-Technical Institute of the Russian Academy of Sciences''' (for short, '''Ioffe Institute''', {{lang-ru|Физико-технический институт им. А. Ф. Иоффе}}) is one of [[Russia]]'s largest research centers specialized in [[physics]] and technology. The institute was established in 1918 in [[Petrograd]] (now St. Petersburg) and run for several decades by [[Abram Ioffe]]. The Institute is a member of the [[Russian Academy of Sciences]].

== Present structure of the Institute ==
As of 2018, the Ioffe institute employs about 1500 people, around 1000 of whom are scientific researchers (including 560 with a PhD degree and 250 with a [[Doktor Nauk]] degree). 
Most of the research staff members are top graduates of the St. Petersburg (former Leningrad) universities. 

From 2013 till mid-May 2018 the Ioffe institute was under formal jurisdiction of the Federal Agency for Scientific Organizations (FASO Russia), now it is under jurisdiction of the established in May 2018 [[Ministry of Science and Higher Education (Russia)|Ministry of Science and Higher Education]], like all other institutions of the Russian Academy of Sciences (RAS).

The Institute is organized into five divisions:
* Center for Nano-Heterostructure Physics
* Solid State Electronics
* [[Solid State Physics]]
* [[Plasma Physics]], Atomic Physics and [[Astrophysics]]
* Physics of [[Dielectrics]] and [[Semiconductor]]s
Each of the divisions includes several laboratories. The institute has its own graduate school and a scientific council. There exists an intensive collaboration with the research and industrial establishments in Russia and worldwide.

The institute publishes four scientific journals: ''Semiconductors'' ({{lang-ru|Физика и техника полупроводников}}), ''Physics of the Solid State'' ({{lang-ru|Физика твёрдого тела}}) and ''Technical Physics'' (journal + letters) ({{lang-ru|Журнал технической физики (основной + письма}})).

== Founding of the institute ==
The foundation date of the Ioffe Institute is September 23, 1918 – the day of signing the decree on the establishment of the physical and technical department in the (established in March of the same year) State Roentgenological and Radiological Institute in [[Petrograd]]. Despite tremendous economic problems after the World War I and the [[October Revolution]] (1917), the development of science was one of the priorities of the new Communist government. 

[[File:Физико-технический институт им. А. Ф. Иоффе. Вид с Политехнической ул. Ограда 3.jpg|thumb|left|220px|The entrance plaque, preserved from the Soviet times]]
The abovementioned department was headed by [[Abram Ioffe|A. F. Ioffe]]. In 1922, on its basis, the State Physicotechnical Radiology Institute has emerged. After several reorganizations and renaming, since 1933, the institute became “Leningrad Physicotechnical Institute”. The form “Physicotechnical” is a Russian variant for “Physical &amp; Technical”. Three decades later, in the 1960s, the word “Ioffe” was added to the institute name, in honor of the first director. 

Since 1939, the Institute has been a member of the Academy of Sciences of the USSR (since 1991 – of the Russian Academy of Sciences). In 1967, it was awarded the [[Order of Lenin]]. These details were reflected in the institute name, especially in Russian. Also now, for historical reasons, there remained the entrance plaque (s. photo): “Academy of Sciences of the USSR, A. F. Ioffe Physicotechnical Institute, awarded the Order of Lenin” ({{lang-ru|Oрдена Ленина Физико-технический институт им. А. Ф. Иоффе АН СССР}}).  

Presently, in English texts, for example in scientific papers, the name “[А. F.] Ioffe [Physical-Technical] Institute [of the Russian Academy of Sciences]” is used (the optional fragments are enclosed in square brackets). 

== Main scientific achievements ==
The Ioffe Institute is considered the cradle of Soviet physics. Such outstanding scientists as [[Lev Landau|L. D. Landau]], [[Pyotr Kapitsa|P. L. Kapitsa]] started their career here, many physicists — among them [[Yakov Borisovich Zel'dovich|Y. B. Zeldovich]], [[Igor Kurchatov|I. V. Kurchatov]], [[Igor Tamm|I. E. Tamm]] — have worked at the Institute for some time.

The research of the Institute covers nearly all fields of the contemporary physics, including the solid-state, semiconductors, quantum electronics, astrophysics, plasma, fluid dynamics, cosmology, nuclear synthesis. 

More than 100 employees of the Institute were recognized by awarding the highest prizes and orders of the Soviet Union and of Russia – in particular the Lenin and State Prizes of the USSR, State Prizes of Russia, Government prizes and special prizes of the Soviet/Russian Academy of Sciences.

Twice, the Nobel Prize was awarded for the works performed at the Ioffe Institute. In 1956, academician [[Nikolay Semyonov|N. N. Semyonov]] (together with [[Cyril Norman Hinshelwood|C. N. Hinshelwood]]) got the [[Nobel Prize in Chemistry]] for a discovery and study of [[Chain reaction|chain reactions]]: the works were made and published in 1927, when N. N. Semyonov was a staff member of the Institute. In 2000, [[Zhores Alferov|Zh. I. Alferov]], director of the Ioffe Institute at that time, became a [[Nobel Prize in Physics|Nobel Prize laureate in Physics]] (together with [[Herbert Kroemer|H. Kroemer]] and [[Jack Kilby|J. Kilby]]) for the development of semiconductor heterostructures for high-speed optoelectronics.

The Ioffe Institute has played a central role in the development of photovoltaic solar power in Russia and internationally, and thus in the development of renewable energy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/289325179_Russian_renewable_energy_The_potential_for_international_cooperation?_iepl%5BgeneralViewId%5D=OStyJJLs4S7luUUqaA1Fgqd0DanTtxPXfOHk&amp;_iepl%5Bcontexts%5D%5B0%5D=searchReact&amp;_iepl%5BviewId%5D=Lpu67iamSHgmLs0G5oXdoM4C869MSvhr7uPn&amp;_iepl%5BsearchType%5D=publication&amp;_iepl%5Bdata%5D%5BcountLessEqual20%5D=1&amp;_iepl%5Bdata%5D%5BinteractedWithPosition1%5D=1&amp;_iepl%5Bdata%5D%5BwithoutEnrichment%5D=1&amp;_iepl%5Bposition%5D=1&amp;_iepl%5BrgKey%5D=PB%3A289325179&amp;_iepl%5BtargetEntityId%5D=PB%3A289325179&amp;_iepl%5BinteractionType%5D=publicationTitle|title=Russian Renewable Energy: The Potential for International Cooperation|last=Overland|first=Indra|last2=Kjaernet|first2=Heidi|publisher=Asghate|year=2009|isbn=|location=Farnham|pages=48, 158}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Buildings ==
The main building of the Ioffe Institute (s. photo at the top of the article and the very left part of the photo below) is located at Polytechnicheskaya Street, 26. It was built in a [[Neoclassicism]] style in 1912–1916 by the architect G. D. Grimm and served as "a refuge for the elderly needy hereditary noblemen in commemoration of the 300th anniversary of the Romanovs' house" at the forty-prized ones, on the second floor they arranged Church (now the Small Assembly Hall of the Institute).&lt;ref&gt; Глезеров С.

[[File:KurchatovStr.jpg|thumb|300px|Buildings belonging to the Ioffe Institute; this photo was shot from the Academician Ioffe square]]
In 1920 the building was adapted to the Institute by the design of civil engineers P. I. Sidorov and Yu. V. Bilinsky. The ceremonial transfer of the building to the Institute took place on February 4, 1923. Until 1953, the apartment of A. F. Ioffe was located in the same building.&lt;ref&gt;Алфёров Ж. И. Папа Иоффе и его «детский сад» (Лекция из цикла «Наука и культура XXI века», АФТУ, 10 октября 2008 года) // Наука и культура: избранные лекции / Сост. Ю. В.

Beyond this historical building, a more modern building on another side of the Kurchatov Street (the right part of the photo) also belongs to the Ioffe Institute. It was constructed in the 1970s. Furthermore, some laboratories of the Ioffe Institute are placed in Shuvalovo, a north-west outskirts of St. Petersburg.  

In front of the main facade are the busts of [[Abram Ioffe]] (sculptor G. D. Glickman, 1964) and [[Boris Konstantinov]] (sculptor [[Mikhail Anikushin]], 1975). On either side of the main entrance are memorial plaques: to the left of the entrance are S. N.

{{About|the carnal desire}}

[[File:Jheronimus Bosch Table of the Mortal Sins (Luxuria).jpg|thumb|right|280px|Detail: ''Luxuria'' (Lust), in ''[[The Seven Deadly Sins and the Four Last Things]]'', by [[Hieronymus Bosch]]]]
{{emotion}}
'''Lust''' is a psychological force producing intense wanting for an object, or circumstance fulfilling the emotion.&lt;ref&gt;Richard Lazarus with Bernice N Lazarus, ''Passion and Reason: Making Sense of Our Emotions'', 1994, New York: Oxford University Press {{ISBN|978-0-19-510461-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Lust can take any form such as the lust for sexuality, money or power. It can take such mundane forms as the lust for food as distinct from the need for food.

==In religion==

Religions, especially Christianity, tend to draw a distinction between passion and lust by further categorizing lust as an inappropriate desire or a desire that is inappropriately strong, and therefore morally wrong, whereas passion (for proper purposes)  is maintained to be something God-given and moral.

===Buddhism===
{{Main article|tanha}}

Lust holds a critical position in the philosophical underpinnings of Buddhist reality.  It is named in the second of the [[Four Noble Truths]], which are that 
# Suffering ([[dukkha]]) is inherent in all life.
# Suffering is caused by ''lust''.
# There is a natural way to eliminate all suffering from one's life.
# The [[Noble Eightfold Path]] is that way.

Lust is the, attachment to, identification with, and passionate desire for certain things in existence, all of which relate to the [[Five skandhas#The five skandhas|form, sensation, perception, mentality, and consciousness]] that certain combinations of these things engender within us. Lust is thus the ultimate cause of general imperfection and the most immediate ''root'' cause of a certain suffering.

The passionate desire for either non-existence or for freedom from lust is a common misunderstanding. For example, the headlong pursuit of lust (or other "[[Seven deadly sins|deadly sin]]") in order to fulfill a [[death instinct|desire for death]] is followed by a reincarnation accompanied by a self-fulfilling [[karma]], resulting in an endless [[wheel of life]], until the right way to live, the right worldview, is somehow discovered and practiced. Beholding an [[endless knot]] puts one, symbolically, in the position of the one with the right worldview, representing that person who attains freedom from lust.

In existence are four kinds of things that engender the clinging: rituals, worldviews, pleasures, and the self.  The way to eliminate lust is to learn of its unintended effects and to pursue righteousness as concerns a worldview, intention, speech, behavior, livelihood, effort, mindfulness, and concentration, in the place where lust formerly sat.
[[File:Sankt_Bartholomäus_(Reichenthal)_04.jpg|left|thumb|156x156px|Detail of ''Lust'' at the [[Bartholomew the Apostle|Sankt Bartholomäus]] church ([[Reichenthal]]), [[Pulpit]] (1894)]]

===Christianity===
==== New Testament ====
In many translations of the [[New Testament]], the word "lust" translates the Greek word ἐπιθυμέω, particularly in [[Matthew 5:27-28]]:
{{"|Ye have heard that it was said by them of old time, Thou shalt not commit adultery: But I say unto you, That whosoever looketh on a woman to lust (ἐπιθυμέω) after her hath committed adultery with her already in his heart.}}

In English-speaking countries, the term "lust" is often associated with [[sexual desire]], probably because of this verse. But just as the English word was originally a general term for ''desire'', the Greek word ἐπιθυμέω was also a general term for desire. The [[LSJ]] lexicon suggests "set one's heart upon a thing, long for, covet, desire" as glosses for ἐπιθυμέω, which is used in verses that clearly have nothing to do with sexual desire. In the [[Septuagint]], ἐπιθυμέω is the word used in the commandment to not covet:

{{"|You shall not covet your neighbor's wife; you shall not covet your neighbor's house or his field or his male slave or his female slave or his ox or his draft animal or any animal of his or whatever belongs to your neighbor.|Exodus 20:17, New English Translation of the Septuagint}}

While coveting your neighbor's wife may involve sexual desire, it's unlikely that coveting a neighbor's house or field is sexual in nature. And in most New Testament uses, the same Greek word, ἐπιθυμέω, does not have a clear sexual connotation. For example, from the [[American Standard Version]] the same word is used outside of any sexual connotation:

# [[Wikisource:Bible (American Standard)/Matthew#13:17|Matthew 13:17]]: For verily I say unto you, that many prophets and righteous men ''desired'' to see the things which ye see, and saw them not; and to hear the things which ye hear, and heard them not.
# [[Wikisource:Bible (American Standard)/Luke#22:15|Luke 22:15-16]]: And he said unto them, With ''desire'' I have desired to eat this passover with you before I suffer: for I say unto you, I shall not eat it, until it be fulfilled in the kingdom of God.
# [[Wikisource:Bible (American Standard)/Acts#20:33|Acts 20:33]]: I ''coveted'' no man's silver, or gold, or apparel. Ye yourselves know that these hands ministered unto my necessities, and to them that were with me.
# [[Wikisource:Bible (American Standard)/Luke#15:14|Luke 15:14-16]]: And when [the [[prodigal son]]] had spent all, there arose a mighty famine in that country; and he began to be in want. And he went and joined himself to one of the citizens of that country; and he sent him into his fields to feed swine. And he ''would fain'' have filled his belly with the husks that the swine did eat: and no man gave unto him.

====Catholicism====
[[File:Daemon.jpg|left|thumb|A demon [[masturbation|satiating his lust]] in a 13th-century manuscript]]
[[File:La Luxure dans l'art roman.JPG|thumb|[[Romanesque art|Romanesque]] [[Capital (architecture)|capital]] representing lust]]

According to the [[Catholic Encyclopedia]], a Christian's heart is lustful when "venereal satisfaction is sought for either outside wedlock or, at any rate, in a manner which is contrary to the laws that govern marital intercourse".&lt;ref&gt;{{CathEncy|wstitle=Lust}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Pope John Paul II]] said that lust devalues the eternal attraction of male and female, reducing personal riches of the opposite sex to an object for gratification of sexuality.&lt;ref name="PopeJohn"&gt;Pope John Paul II, ''Mutual Attraction Differs from Lust''.L'Osservatore Romano, Weekly Edition in English, 22 September 1980, p. 11. Available at http://www.ewtn.com/library/papaldoc/jp2tb39.htm .&lt;/ref&gt;

Lust is considered by [[Catholicism]] to be a disordered desire for [[sexual pleasure]], where sexual pleasure is "sought for itself, isolated from its procreative and unitive purposes".&lt;ref&gt;'Catechism of the Catholic Church, n° 2351 sq.&lt;/ref&gt; In Catholicism, sexual desire in itself is good, and is considered part of God's plan for humanity. However, when sexual desire is separated from God's love, it becomes disordered and self-seeking. This is seen as lust.

The Latin for ''extravagance'' (Latin: ''luxuria'') was used by St [[Jerome]] to translate a variety of biblical sins, including drunkenness and sexual excess.&lt;ref&gt;Mark D. Jordan, ''The Invention of Sodomy'' (1994) p. 37&lt;/ref&gt; [[Gregory the Great]] placed ''luxuria'' as one of the seven capital sins (it is often considered the least serious of the seven deadly sins), narrowing its scope to disordered desire,&lt;ref&gt;Mark D. Jordan, ''The Invention of Sodomy'' (1994) p. 39-40; [https://www.academia.edu/8268216/_Luxure_cléricale_gouvernement_de_l_Église_et_royauté_capétienne_au_temps_de_la_Bible_de_saint_Louis_Revue_Mabillon_25_2014_p._165-194 Julien Théry, "Luxure cléricale, gouvernement de l’Église et royauté capétienne au temps de la 'Bible de saint Louis'", ''Revue Mabillon'', 25, 2014, p. 165-194]&lt;/ref&gt; and it was in this sense that the Middle Ages generally took ''luxuria'', (although the [[Old French]] [[cognate]] was [[loan word|adopted]] into English as ''luxury'' without its sexual meaning by the 14th century{{Citation needed|date=February 2011}}).

In [[Romanesque art]], the [[Anthropomorphism|personified]] Luxuria is generally feminine,&lt;ref&gt;J. Jerman/A. Weir, ''Images of Lust'' (2013) p. 30&lt;/ref&gt; often represented by a [[siren (mythology)|siren]] or a naked woman with breasts being bitten by snakes. [[Prudentius]] in his [[Psychomachia]] or Battle of the Soul had described&lt;ref&gt;Helen Waddell, ''The Wandering Scholars'' (1968) p. 48&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;blockquote&gt; Luxury, lavish of her ruined fame, Loose-haired, wild-eyed, her voice a dying fall, Lost in delight....&lt;/blockquote&gt; For [[Dante]], Luxuria was both the first of the circles of incontinence (or self-indulgence) on the descent into hell, and the last of the cornices of Mount Purgatory, representing the excessive (disordered) love of individuals;&lt;ref&gt;Dante, ''Hell' (1975) p. 101; Dante, ''Purgatory'' (1971) p. 67 and p. 202&lt;/ref&gt; while for [[Edmund Spenser|Spenser]] luxuria was synonymous with the power of desire.&lt;ref&gt;C. J. Berry, ''The Idea of Luxury'' (1994) p. 97-8&lt;/ref&gt;

The daughters (by-products) of Luxuria, for Gregory and subsequent [[Thomism]], included mental blindness, self-love, haste and excessive attachment to the present:&lt;ref&gt;Mark D. Jordan, ''The Invention of Sodomy'' (1994) p. 37-9&lt;/ref&gt; [[Marianne Dashwood]] has been seen as embodying such characteristics for a later age – as a daughter of Luxuria.&lt;ref&gt;Robert Liddell, ''The Novels of Jane Austen'' (London 1963) p. 22&lt;/ref&gt;

===Hinduism===

In the [[Bhagavad Gita]], Lord [[Krishna]], an [[Avatar]] of [[Vishnu]], declared in verse 21 that lust is one of the gates to [[Naraka (Hinduism)|Naraka]] or hell.

{{Quote|[[Arjuna]] said: O descendant of Vrsni, by what is one impelled to [[sin]]ful acts, even unwillingly, as if engaged by force? Then Krishna said: It is lust only, Arjuna, which is born of contact with the material mode of passion and later transformed into [[wrath]], and which is the all-devouring sinful enemy of this world. As fire is covered by smoke, as a mirror is covered by dust, or as the embryo is covered by the womb, the living entity is similarly covered by different degrees of this lust. Thus the wise living entity's pure [[consciousness]] becomes covered by his eternal enemy in the form of lust, which is never satisfied and which burns like fire. The [[senses]], the [[mind]] and the [[intelligence]] are the sitting places of this lust. Through them lust covers the real knowledge of the living entity and bewilders him. Therefore, O Arjuna, best of the Bharatas, in the very beginning curb this great symbol of [[sin]]—(lust) by regulating the senses, and slay this destroyer of [[knowledge]] and [[self-realization]]. The working [[senses]] are superior to dull [[matter]]; [[mind]] is higher than the [[senses]]; [[intelligence]] is still higher than the [[mind]]; and he [the soul] is even higher than the [[intelligence]]. Thus knowing oneself to be [[Transcendence (religion)|transcendental]] to the material senses, mind and intelligence, O mighty-armed Arjuna, one should steady the mind by deliberate [[Spirituality|spiritual]] intelligence and thus—by spiritual strength—conquer this insatiable enemy known as lust. ([[Bhagavad-Gita]], 3.36–43)}}

In this ancient manuscript the idea behind the word 'Lust' is best comprehended as the psychological force called 'Wanting'.

====Brahma Kumaris====
According to [[Brahma Kumaris]], a spiritual organization which is based on [[Hindu philosophy]], sexual lust is the greatest enemy to all mankind&lt;ref&gt;''Through open doors: a view of Asian cultures in Kenya''. Cynthia Salvadori, Andrew Fedders, 1989&lt;/ref&gt; and the gateway to hell.&lt;ref&gt;''Exploring New Religions''. p. 196, George D. Chryssides, 1999&lt;/ref&gt;

For this reason followers do not eat onions, garlic, eggs, or non-vegetarian food, as the "sulphur" in them can excite sexual lust in the body, otherwise bound to celibacy.

The physical act of sex is "impure", leading to body-consciousness and other crimes. This impurity "poisons" the body and leads to many kinds of "diseases".

The Brahma Kumaris teach that sexuality is like foraging about in a dark sewer. Students at Spiritual University must conquer lust in order to find the [[Golden Age]], a heaven on earth, where children are conceived by an asexual power of mind, and lasting for 2,500 years in the peace and purity of a holy swan moving on earth, over water, and in air.&lt;ref&gt;Peace &amp; purity: the story of the Brahma Kumaris : a spiritual revolution By [[Liz Hodgkinson]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''A history of celibacy'', p. 172. Elizabeth Abbott, 2001&lt;/ref&gt;

===Islam===
In [[Islam]], intentional lascivious glances are forbidden. Lascivious thoughts are disliked, for they are the first step towards adultery, rape and other antisocial behaviors. [[Prophet]] [[Muhammad]] also stressed the magnitude of the "second glance", as the first glance towards an attractive member of the opposite sex could be just accidental or observatory, the second glance could be that gate into lustful thinking.&lt;ref&gt; [[Jami` at-Tirmidhi]],2701 "The Messenger of Allaah (Peace &amp; Blessings of Allaah be upon Him) said: "O Ali, do not follow a glance with another, for you will be forgiven for the first, but not for the second.".&lt;/ref&gt; Islam does not advocate [[celibacy]] but it requires marriage to conduct sex legally.

===Judaism===

{{main article|Yetzer hara#The evil inclination in Jewish tradition}}
In [[Judaism]], all evil inclinations and lusts of the flesh are characterized by ''[[Yetzer hara]]'' (Hebrew, יצר הרע, the evil inclination). Yetzer hara is not a demonic force; rather, it is man's misuse of the things which the physical body needs to survive, and is often contrasted with ''yetzer hatov'' (Hebrew, יצר הטוב, the positive desire).

''Yetzer HaRa'' is often identified with [[Satan]] and the angel of death,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Bava Bathra|pages=16a}}&lt;/ref&gt; and there is sometimes a tendency to give a personality and separate activity to the ''yetzer''. For the ''yetzer'', like Satan, misleads man in this world, and testifies against him in the world to come. The ''yetzer'' is, however, clearly distinguished from Satan, and on other occasions is made exactly parallel to sin. The [[Torah]] is considered the great antidote against this force. Though, like all things which God has made, the ''yetzer hara'' (evil inclination) can be manipulated into doing good: for without it, man would never marry, beget a child, build a house, or occupy himself in a trade.

===Paganism===

Few ancient, [[Paganism|pagan religions]] actually considered lust to be a vice.{{Citation needed|date=August 2011}} The most famous example of a widespread religious movement practicing lechery as a ritual is the [[Bacchanalia]] of the [[Ancient Roman]] [[Bacchantes]]. However, this activity was soon outlawed by the [[Roman Senate]] in 186 BC in the decree ''[[Senatus consultum de Bacchanalibus]]''. The practice of sacred prostitution, however, continued to be an activity practiced often by the [[Dionysian]]s.

===Sikhism===

In [[Sikhism]], lust is counted among the five cardinal sins or sinful propensities, the others being [[Wrath]], ego, [[greed (deadly sin)|greed]] and [[Attachment theory|attachment]]. Uncontrollable expression of sexual lust, as in rape or [[sexual addiction]], is an evil.

===Meher Baba's teachings===

The spiritual teacher [[Meher Baba]] described the differences between lust and love:
 
&lt;blockquote&gt;In lust there is reliance upon the object of sense and consequent spiritual subordination of the soul to it, but love puts the soul into direct and co-ordinate relation with the reality which is behind the form. Therefore lust is experienced as being heavy and love is experienced as being light. In lust there is a narrowing down of life and in love there is an expansion in being...If you love the whole world you vicariously live in the whole world, but in lust there is an ebbing down of life and a general sense of hopeless dependence upon a form which is regarded as another. Thus, in lust there is the accentuation of separateness and suffering, but in love there is the feeling of unity and joy....&lt;ref&gt;[[Meher Baba|Baba, Meher]] (1967). [http://www.discoursesbymeherbaba.org/ ''Discourses'']. Volume I. San Francisco: Sufism Reoriented. pp. 159–160. {{ISBN|978-1880619094}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==In culture==

===Medieval prostitutes===

Medieval prostitutes lived officially sanctioned in "red light districts." In Ruth Mazo Karras' book ''Common Women'', she discusses the meaning of prostitution and how people thought the proper use of prostitutes by unmarried men helped contain male lust. Prostitution was thought of as having a beneficial effect by reducing the [[sexual frustration]] in the community.&lt;ref&gt;Karras, Ruth Mazo. Common Women: Prostitution and Sexuality in Medieval England. New York: Oxford UP, 1996. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

== In art ==

[[File:Mujeres riendo.jpg|right|thumb|[[Goya]]'s [[Man Mocked by Two Women]] (''Dos Mujeres y un hombre''), c. 1820]]

=== Literature ===

From [[Ovid]] to the works of ''[[poète maudit|les poètes maudits]]'', characters have always been faced with scenes of lechery, and long since has lust been a common motif in world literature. Many writers, such as [[Georges Bataille]], [[Casanova]] and [[Prosper Mérimée]], have written works wherein scenes at bordellos and other unseemly locales take place.

[[Baudelaire]], author of ''[[Les fleurs du mal]]'', had once remarked, in regard to the artist, that:

{{cquote|The more a man cultivates the arts, the less randy he becomes... Only the brute is good at coupling, and copulation is the lyricism of the masses. To copulate is to enter into another—and the artist never emerges from himself.}}

The most notable work to touch upon the sin of lust, and all of the Seven Deadly Sins, is Dante's ''[[la Divina Commedia]]''. Dante's criterion for lust was an "excessive love of others," insofar as an excessive love for man would render one's love of God secondary.

In the first canticle of [[Dante]]'s ''[[Divine Comedy#Inferno|Inferno]]'', the lustful are punished by being continuously swept around in a whirlwind, which symbolizes their passions. The damned who are guilty of lust, like the two famous lovers, Paolo and Francesca, receive what they desired in their mortal lives, their passions never give them rest for all eternity. In ''[[Purgatorio]]'', of the selfsame work, the penitents choose to walk through flames in order to purge themselves of their lustful inclinations.

==In philosophy==

The link between [[love]] and lust has always been a problematic question in philosophy.

===Schopenhauer===

[[Schopenhauer]] notes the misery which results from [[sexual relationship]]s. According to him, this directly explains the sentiments of shame and sadness which tend to follow the act of sexual intercourse. For, he states, the only power that reigns is the inextinguishable desire to face, at any price, the blind love present in human existence without any consideration of the outcome. He estimates that a genius of his species is an industrial being who wants only to produce, and wants only to think. The theme of lust for Schopenhauer is thus to consider the horrors which will almost certainly follow the culmination of lust.

===St. Thomas Aquinas===

[[St. Thomas Aquinas]] defines the sin of Lust in questions 153 and 154 of his Summa Theologica. Aquinas says the sin of lust is of "voluptuous emotions," and makes the point that sexual pleasures, "unloosen the human spirit," and set aside right reason (Pg.191). Aquinas restricts lust's subject matter to physical desires specifically arising from sexual acts, but Aquinas does not assume all sex-acts are sinful. Sex is not a sin in marriage, because sex is the only way for humans to reproduce. If sex is used naturally and the end purpose is reproduction there is no sin. Aquinas says, "if the end be good and if what is done is well-adapted to that, then no sin is present," (Pg.193). However, sex simply for the sake of pleasure is lustful and therefore, a sin. A man who uses his body for lechery wrongs the Lord.

Sex may have the attributes of being sinless; however, when a person seeks sex for pleasure, he or she is sinning with lust. Lust is best defined by its specific attribute of rape, adultery, wet dreams, seduction, unnatural vice, and simple fornication.

[[Wet dreams]]: St. Thomas Aquinas defined and discussed the topic of nocturnal emission, which occurs when one dreams of physical pleasure. Aquinas argues those who say that wet dreams are a sin and comparable to the actual experience of sex are wrong. Aquinas believes that such an action is sinless, for a dream is not under a person's control or free judgment. When one has a "nocturnal orgasm," it is not a sin, but it can lead to sins (Pg. 227). Aquinas says that wet dreams come from a physical cause of inappropriate pictures within your imagination, a psychological cause when thinking of sex while you fall asleep and a demonical cause where by demons act upon the sleepers body, "stirring the sleeper's imagination to bring about a orgasm," (Pg. 225).  In the end, though, dreaming of lustful acts is not sinful. The "mind's awareness is less hindered," as the sleeper lacks right reason; therefore, a person cannot be accountable for what they dream while sleeping, (Pg. 227).

[[Adultery]]: One of the main forms of lust seen frequently during the Middle Ages was the sin of adultery. The sin of adultery occurs when a person is unfaithful to his or her spouse, hence "invading of a bed not one's own," (Pg.235). Adultery is a special kind of ugliness and many difficulties arise from it. When a man enters the bed of a married woman it not only is a sin, but it "wrongs the offspring," because the woman now calls into question the legitimacy of children. (Pg.235). If a wife has committed adultery before, then, her husband will question if all his wife's children are his offspring. 
	
[[Fornication|Simple fornication]]: Simple fornication is having sex with one's wife for enjoyment rather than for bearing children. Fornication is also sex between two unmarried people, which is also a mortal sin. Aquinas says, "fornication is a deadly crime," (Pg.213). Fornication is a mortal sin, but as Aquinas notes, "Pope Gregory treated sins of the flesh as less grievous than those of the spirit" (Pg. 217). Fornication was a grave sin such as that against property. Fornication, however, is not as grave as a sin directly against God and human life; therefore, murder is much worse than fornication. Property in this case means that a daughter is the property of her father, and if you do wrong to her, you then do wrong to him; therefore seducing a virgin or seeking pleasure from an unmarried woman is an invasion of a father's property.

[[Rape]]: Rape is a kind of lust that often coincides with seduction and is defined as a type of lechery. Rape comes with force and violence: Rape occurs when a person craves the pleasures of sex so intensely that he uses force to obtain it. Rape is committed when violence is used to seduce, or deflower a virgin. Rape harms both the unmarried girl and her father, because the girl is property of her father. Rape and seduction can be discussed together, because both sins involve the deflowering of a virgin; however, rape can happen without seduction, as when a man attacks a widow or a sexually experienced woman and violates her. Therefore, wherever violence accompanies sex, you have the quality of rape and the sin of lust.

[[Seduction]]: Seduction is a type of lust, because seduction is a sex act, which ravishes a virgin. Lust is a sin of sexual activity, and, "…a special quality of wrong that appears if a maid still under her father's care is debauched" (Pg.229). Seduction involves a discussion of property, as an unmarried girl is property of her father. A virgin, even though free from the bond of marriage, is not free from the bond of her family. When a virgin is violated without a promise of engagement, she is prevented from having honorable marriage, which is shameful to herself and her family. A man who performs sexual acts with a virgin must "endow her and have her to wife," and if the father, who is responsible for her, says no, then a man must pay a dowry to compensate for her loss of virginity and future chance of marriage. (Pg.229)

'''Unnatural vice:''' Unnatural vice is the worst kind of lust because it is unnatural in act and purpose. Unnatural vice happens variously, but Aquinas provides several examples including [[bestiality]] or intercourse with a "thing of another species," for example animals. Aquinas said, "bestiality goes beyond the bands of humanity" and is therefore, unnatural.

==Contemporary spiritual perspective==

[[Barry Long]] states that lusting is simply thinking or fantasising about an [[sexual fantasy|imagined sexual scene]] and private parts of the body. The action of thinking or fantasising stirs the natural, pure sexual energy into a coarser, more degraded emotional form (lust).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.barrylong.org/statements/manschallenge.shtml |title=Barry Long Foundation International |publisher=Barrylong.org |date= |accessdate=2011-11-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;'MAKING LOVE Sexual Love the Divine Way' Barry Long, Book {{ISBN|978-1-899324-14-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Barry Long, Gold Coast Talks audio, February 1997&lt;/ref&gt; Long encourages lovemaking as the practice of converting sexual energy into the knowledge of love: "You don’t need a celibate body, you need a celibate mind".&lt;ref&gt;Gold Coast Talks audio April 1998&lt;/ref&gt;

==In psychoanalysis and psychology==

{{Main article|libido}}
Lust, in the domain of [[psychoanalysis]] and [[psychology]], is often treated as a case of "heightened [[libido]]".

A person is more likely to lust after someone who does not resemble themself. Self-relatedness is a cue of kinship and causes an instinctual reaction to not be attracted. Therefore, self-resemblance decreases attractiveness and sexual desire in a person, while less resemblance increases attractiveness and sexual desire, creating a higher possibility of lust.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1098/rspb.2004.3003| title = Trustworthy but not lust-worthy: Context-specific effects of facial resemblance| journal = Proceedings of the Royal Society B: Biological Sciences| volume = 272| issue = 1566| pages = 919–22| year = 2005| last1 = Debruine | first1 = L.

'''Media linguistics''' is the [[linguistics|linguistic]] study of media speech. It studies the functioning of [[language]] in the [[Mass media|media]] sphere, or the modern [[mass communication]] presented by print, audiovisual and networked media.

Media linguistics is being formed in the process of [[Differentiation (linguistics)|differentiation]] of [[linguistics]] as a general theory of language, and its term turned out to be in line with [[psycholinguistics]], [[sociolinguistics]], [[developmental linguistics]], [[legal linguistics]], [[political linguistics]], etc.{{cn|date=February 2013}}

== Object ==
Modern media linguistics examines not only the language of media, but also media speech. Media linguistics includes such discipline as ''media speech studies'' that examines (1) the speech behavior of [[mass communication]] participants and (2) specific areas, textures and genres of media texts. 

Thus, in principle, media linguistics seeks to explain the particular case of the functioning of language—in mass communications with its complex structure and diverse trends of change—amid the overall trends of language and speech culture.&lt;ref&gt;Hult, F.M. (2010).  Swedish Television as a mechanism for language planning and policy. &lt;I&gt;Language Problems and Language Planning, 34&lt;/i&gt;(2), 158-181.&lt;/ref&gt; Media linguistics is closely related to the contemporary media practices and intends to impact on them, in particular, by means of media education.

== In various countries ==
* In '''English-speaking countries''' the terms ''[[Media studies|media study]]'' and ''media [[discourse analysis]]'' are used, corresponding with such interdisciplinary approach as [[Critical discourse analysis]]. See, for example, [[Teun A. van Dijk]]'s book ''News as Discourse''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title= News as Discourse|year=1988|publisher= Hillsdale NJ: Erlbaum |isbn= 0-8058-0828-0 |url=http://mitpress.mit.edu/catalog/item/examrequest.asp?ttype=2&amp;tid=12240|author= Teun A. Van Dijk |accessdate=18 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* In '''Germany''' such term as ''Medienlinguistik'' is typical.&lt;ref&gt;[[:de:Medienlinguistik]]&lt;/ref&gt;
* In '''Russia''' active usage of the term ''Медиалингвистика'' is associated with the publications of T.G. Dobrosklonskaya, where English media speech is investigated. Russian media linguistics is the successor of different linguistic researches, which were designated as and called "the language of newspaper", "he language of radio", "the language of media".&lt;ref&gt;"Media Linguistics": a scientific web site: http://medialing.spbu.ru/world_of_medialinguistics/ and an international journal of the same name [http://medialing.ru https://medialing.ru]&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;!-- what is the thing that is move? what is the nature of the test or measurement on it? --&gt;

'''Motion system''' is a component of a [[Experiment|test]] and [[measurement]] [[system]] that provides motion to a [[Structural load|load]] or loads in a one or many directions.  Generally a motion system is made up of a set (or stack) of [[linear]] and [[rotational]] stages. A [[linear stage]] moves in a [[straight line]], while a rotation stage moves in a partial or full circle.  A stage can either be manually controlled with a knob control, or automated with a motion controller.

A motion system generally is computer controlled and can perform fast, reliable, repeatable, and accurate positioning of loads.  Most systems will support motion in X and Y directions, which is referred to as an XY stack.  Often either a Z axis (up/down motion) or R axis (rotational motion) is placed on top of the XY stack.

For automated stages, a scale can be attached to the internals of the stage and an encoder used to measure the position on the scale and report this to the controller, thereby determining the precise position of the stage.  This allows for a motion controller to reliably and repeatably move to set positions with the linear stage.

'''Movement Research''' is a non-profit organization that offers dance classes, workshops, residencies and performance opportunities for artists in [[New York City]]. Its focus is on improvisation, post-modern dance, and experimentation.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mouvement.net/teteatete/portraits/questions-en-mouvement Portrait of Movement Research in the French magazine Mouvement]&lt;/ref&gt; It was founded in 1978 under the name “The School for Movement Research &amp; Construction” and incorporated in 1980 after its first public performance in 1979. Movement Research organizes performances at the [[Judson Memorial Church]] among other locations around New York City. It has a long tie with Judson Church and [[Judson Dance Theater]] which shares some of the same base of artists.&lt;ref name=newm&gt;{{cite web|title=Movement Research in Residence|url=http://www.newmuseum.org/pages/view/movement-research|work=Rethinking the Imprint of Judson Dance Theater Fifty Years Later September–December 2012|publisher=[[New Museum]]|accessdate=2014-04-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In Spring 2018, Movement Research announced they will be occupying 3 spaces in the newly renovated 122 Community Center, making 122CC Movement Research's first permanent home in their 40 year history.

==Initiatives==
Among Movement Research's initiatives are a weekly dance practice at [[Judson Memorial Church]], ''Open Performance'', an open discussion moderated by a Movement Research Artist-in-Residence, ''Studies Project'', a curated series of panels, and performances focused on a variety of issues, and the two-week Movement Research Festival that explores contemporary dance and the issues around it.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.artforum.com/diary/id=22733 Claudia La Rocco's Art Forum review of "Roll Call" 2009 Movement Research Spring Festival]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=gia&gt;{{cite news|last=Kourlas|first=Gia|title=For Movement Research, a Time to Cast a Wide Net Over Disciplines and Countries|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/06/07/arts/dance/07move.html?pagewanted=all&amp;_r=0|accessdate=2014-04-08|newspaper=New York Times|date=2008-06-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
They also host a series of low-cost classes led by dance artists;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.artforum.com/diary/id=25125 Art Forum review of [[Anna Halprin]]'s workshop "Does Dance Make a Difference"]&lt;/ref&gt; an artist in residence program known by the name AIR; and MRX, a traveling artist in residence program.

==Publications==
Movement Research has two publications: ''[[Performance Journal]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://catalog.lib.byu.edu/uhtbin/cgisirsi/X/0/0/5/?user_id=WEBSERVER&amp;new_gateway_db=ILINK&amp;searchdata1=1077-0933%7B022%7D+NOT+jfinder.pl%7B856%7D Brigham Young University's Harold B. Lee library catalog]&lt;/ref&gt;'', a printed piece that focuses on current issues in performance; and ''Critical Correspondence'', a web-based publication that includes interviews, experimental and scholarly writing, podcasts and video projects. "Critical Correspondence" &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.movementresearch.org/criticalcorrespondence/ Link to Critical Correspondence]&lt;/ref&gt; is currently edited by [[Amelia Bande]] and [[Tess Dworman]].

== Characteristics ==
Some museum folklorists work full-time in museums of [[ethnography]], [[ethnology]], [[cultural history]], or [[folk art]], often as educators, [[curators]], and directors. Others work in other settings, such as in [[public folklore]] programs, academic departments, community-based organizations, and consultancies. Such folklorists either partner with museums in the development of scholarly and public programs or study the history and impact of such work.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Dewhurst|first1=C.

There is significant interaction and overlap between museum folklore and the neighboring field of [[museum anthropology]], as well as the interdisciplinary field of [[material culture]] studies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Berlinger|first1=Gabrielle A.|title=Ethnography as a Strategy in Museum Preservation|journal=Practicing Anthropology|date=2015|volume=37|issue=3|pages=34-34|doi=10.17730/0888-4552-37.3.34}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Dewhurst|first1=C.

== Organizations ==

An organizational home for the sub-field in the United States and Canada is the [http://www.afsnet.org/?page=MuseumSection Folklore and Museums section] of the [[American Folklore Society]]. Among folklorists, this section is cognate to the [[Council for Museum Anthropology]] among museum anthropologists.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2884">The '''Papyrus Graecus Holmiensis''' (also known as the '''Stockholm papyrus''') is a collection of craft recipes compiled in [[Egypt]] {{circa|300 AD}}. It is written in [[Greek language|Greek]]. The Stockholm papyrus has 154 recipes for dyeing, coloring gemstones, cleaning (purifying) pearls, and imitation gold and silver.&lt;ref&gt;Caley, E. R. (1927) “The Stockholm Papyrus : An English Translation with brief notes”  Journal of Chemical Education  IV:8 : 979-1002.&lt;/ref&gt; Certain of them may derive from the [[Pseudo-Democritus]].  [[Zosimos of Panopolis]], a Greek [[Alchemy|alchemist]] of {{circa|300 AD}}, gives similar recipes. Some of these recipes are found in medieval Latin collections of technological recipes, notably the [[Mappae clavicula]].

[[Leyden papyrus X]] derives from the same (or very similar) sources, and is written in a similar (possibly the same) hand, using chemically identical ink.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | title = Papyrus Graecus Holmiensis | work = World Digital Library | accessdate = 2014-11-25 | url = http://www.wdl.org/en/item/14299/}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Long2001"&gt;{{cite book|last=Long|first=Pamela O.|title=Openness, secrecy, authorship: technical arts and the culture of knowledge from antiquity to the Renaissance|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=x_k91r2u6NgC|accessdate=1 June 2011|year=2001|publisher=JHU Press|isbn=9780801866067|page=64}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Stockholm papyrus and Leyden papyrus X were both found in Thebes by [[Giovanni Anastasi (merchant)|Giovanni Anastasi]], who donated the Leyden papyrus to the Dutch government in 1828 and the Stockholm papyrus to the Swedish government in 1832. The Stockholm papyrus was first published by [[Otto Lagercrantz]] in 1913.

The degree was designed for those seeking academic research and teaching careers as faculty or professors in the study of management at business schools worldwide.&lt;ref&gt;Becoming a Business Professor {{cite web |url=http://www.aacsb.edu/resource_centers/DoctoralEdu/BusinessProfessor-full.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2016-01-05 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090711061612/http://www.aacsb.edu/resource_centers/DoctoralEdu/BusinessProfessor-full.pdf |archivedate=2009-07-11 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The Ph.D. in Management Degree==

===Business doctoral programs===

A [[PhD]] degree is a [[doctor of philosophy]] which can be obtained in many areas of study, while a '''PhD in management''' is specific to the study of research questions with potential relevance to the business world. Areas of specialization for the PhD in business often include, but are not limited to:

* [[Accounting]]
* Decision sciences ([[decision theory]] and [[decision analysis]])
* [[Economics]]
* [[Entrepreneurship]]
* [[Ethics]] and [[legal studies]]
* [[Finance]]
* [[Health care management]]
* [[People management]] or Human Resource management
* [[Leadership]]
* [[Marketing]]
* [[Organizational behavior]]
* [[Operations management]] / [[Operations research]]
* [[Management information systems]] / [[Information technology management]]
* [[Statistics]]
* [[Strategy]]

A '''PhD in management''' or '''business''' is often required for those interested in pursuing an academic career as a professor at a business school.&lt;ref&gt;AACSB "Becoming a Business Professor" article {{cite web |url=http://www.aacsb.edu/resource_centers/DoctoralEdu/BusinessProfessor-full.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2016-01-05 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090711061612/http://www.aacsb.edu/resource_centers/DoctoralEdu/BusinessProfessor-full.pdf |archivedate=2009-07-11 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Business schools often require faculty to hold a Ph.D. and to engage in research.&lt;ref&gt;AACSB "Becoming a Business Professor" {{cite web |url=http://www.aacsb.edu/resource_centers/DoctoralEdu/BusinessProfessor-full.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2016-01-05 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090711061612/http://www.aacsb.edu/resource_centers/DoctoralEdu/BusinessProfessor-full.pdf |archivedate=2009-07-11 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Business school rankings are often heavily influenced by the proportion of faculty with Ph.D. degrees or doctorates.&lt;ref&gt;2009 FT rankings table and criteria list http://rankings.ft.com/exportranking/global-mba-rankings/pdf&lt;/ref&gt;  Research is fundamental to the integrity of a graduate educational institution.  Through research, professors gain the expertise required to teach advanced courses and to ensure that they remain current in his or her chosen field.

===Brief history===

In the 1950s and 1960s, leading '''business schools''' made a transition from vocational training to scientific research, rooted in social sciences, such as economics, [[psychology]], [[sociology]], [[anthropology]], [[systems engineering]], and [[mathematics]].  Since then, Ph.D. programs in business prepare candidates to conduct scholarly research based on rigorous methods and applied to business.  For example, such research might aim to develop new theory and empirical knowledge about business and management problems by combining methods from economics, psychology and mathematical decision theory.  By combining methods from multiple social sciences, business research has developed its own subfields of research, published in business application oriented journals as well as in social sciences journals.&lt;ref&gt;Ph.D. Project http://www.phdproject.org/downloads/What_is_a_PhD.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

===Business research===

Research with regard to the study of business encompasses a wide range of activities.  There are many research methodologies or "tools" one must learn before being able to conduct research.  A PhD program in business will teach one of these various methods.&lt;ref&gt;Stanford http://www.gsb.stanford.edu/phd/overview/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;INSEAD http://www.insead.edu/phd/program/program_structure.cfm&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Columbia http://www4.gsb.columbia.edu/phd/whycolumbia/&lt;/ref&gt;
http://www5.google.columbia.phd/wikipedia/&lt;/net&gt;

===Research methodologies===

Common research methodologies used in studying business are: Modeling, [[Econometrics]], [[Experiment]]s, descriptive and Field Studies.

==Program structure==

Typically, the PhD in management takes 4–5 years to complete.&lt;ref&gt;AACSB article about a PhD in Business and Becoming a Business Professor {{cite web |url=http://www.aacsb.edu/resource_centers/DoctoralEdu/BusinessProfessor-full.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2016-01-05 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090711061612/http://www.aacsb.edu/resource_centers/DoctoralEdu/BusinessProfessor-full.pdf |archivedate=2009-07-11 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The structure is usually 2 years of intensive coursework (core courses and seminars) followed by a comprehensive examination.&lt;ref name="aacsb.edu"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.aacsb.edu/resource_centers/DoctoralEdu/BusinessProfessor-full.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2016-01-05 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090711061612/http://www.aacsb.edu/resource_centers/DoctoralEdu/BusinessProfessor-full.pdf |archivedate=2009-07-11 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The dissertation phase is typically 2–3 years.&lt;ref name="aacsb.edu"/&gt;

==Careers==

Becoming a professor of business means investing years of study before obtaining the desired degree, but academia offers many benefits, including: attractive salaries, the combination of varied activities in one career, intellectual stimulation as well as professional autonomy.&lt;ref&gt;PhD Project {{cite web |url=http://www.phdproject.org/faqs.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2016-01-05 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141219110256/http://www.phdproject.org/faqs.html |archivedate=2014-12-19 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, following through with a PhD degree can be challenging not only because of the academic rigour but also due to the pressure and stress that comes from conducting research and defending a dissertation.  Moreover, once a person obtains a PhD, there is no guarantee that even with an offer from a business school, that the PhD student will go on to publish his or her research in a top journal, will be able to teach effectively, or will receive a tenured faculty position.

Still, for those who have the motivation, drive and stamina to be successful in this field, there are many benefits.  The life of a business professor is markedly different from a corporate career. An academic has more time to explore his or her own interests, pursues research, and rarely has a 'nine to five' type of career. Being a professor is much like being an entrepreneur (bad link – ).&lt;ref name="hbs.edu"&gt;http://www.hbs.edu/doctoral/SYOA/page2.html&lt;/ref&gt;  Success is based on the individual, and faculty are often their own bosses. Beyond being intellectually bright and able to conduct research, professors in business also need to be able to perform in the classroom.  Teaching is a fundamental component of being a professor, though most faculty may only teach around 100 hours per year, the classroom setting can be challenging and often involve debate.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.hbs.edu/doctoral/SYOA/page1.html&lt;/ref&gt;

Not everyone can be a professor, but for those that have the skills required, it provides an excellent standard of living, with salaries comparable to the corporate world.&lt;ref name="hbs.edu"/&gt;  Consulting, book publishing and speaking engagements can also further add to overall compensation.&lt;ref name="hbs.edu"/&gt;  Academic institutions are often less vulnerable than corporations to forces like global economic downturns.  Academia offers much in the way of financial stability.&lt;ref name="hbs.edu"/&gt;

===PhD versus DBA===
The PhD in Business Administration is equivalent to the [[Doctor of Business Administration]] (DBA).&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ed.gov/about/offices/list/ous/international/usnei/us/doctorate.doc&lt;/ref&gt; Both doctorates are research doctorates representing the highest academic qualification in business in the U.S. education system.

In [[hydrodynamics]], a '''plume''' is a column of one fluid moving through another.  Several effects control the motion of the fluid, including momentum (inertia), diffusion and buoyancy (density differences).  Pure ''jets'' and pure ''plumes'' define flows that are driven entirely by momentum and buoyancy effects, respectively.  Flows between these two limits are usually described as forced plumes or buoyant jets.  "Buoyancy is defined as being positive" when, in the absence of other forces or initial motion, the entering fluid would tend to rise.  Situations where the density of the plume fluid is greater than its surroundings (i.e. in still conditions, its natural tendency would be to sink), but the flow has sufficient initial momentum to carry it some distance vertically, are described as being negatively buoyant.&lt;ref&gt;Turner, J.S. (1979), "Buoyancy effects in fluids", Ch.6, pp.165--&amp;, Cambridge University Press&lt;/ref&gt;

==Movement==
Usually, as a plume moves away from its source, it widens because of [[entrainment (hydrodynamics)|entrainment]] of the surrounding fluid at its edges. Plume shapes can be influenced by flow in the ambient fluid (for example, if local wind blowing in the same direction as the plume results in a co-flowing jet). This usually causes a plume which has initially been 'buoyancy-dominated'  to become 'momentum-dominated' (this transition is usually predicted by a dimensionless number called the [[Richardson number]]).

=== Flow and detection ===
A further phenomenon of importance is whether a plume has [[laminar flow]] or [[turbulent flow]]. Usually there is a transition from laminar to turbulent as the plume moves away from its source. This phenomenon can be clearly seen in the rising column of smoke from a cigarette. When high accuracy is required, [[computational fluid dynamics]] (CFD) can be employed to simulate plumes, but the results can be sensitive to the [[turbulence model]] chosen. CFD is often undertaken for '''rocket plumes''', where condensed phase constituents can be present in addition to gaseous constituents. These types of simulations can become quite complex, including [[afterburning]] and [[thermal radiation]], and (for example) [[ballistic missile]] launches are often detected by sensing hot rocket plumes. Similarly, spacecraft managers are sometimes concerned with impingement of [[attitude control system]] thruster plumes onto sensitive subsystems like solar arrays and star trackers.

Another phenomenon which can also be seen clearly in the flow of smoke from a cigarette is that the leading-edge of the flow, or the starting-plume, is quite often approximately in the shape of a ring-[[vortex]] ([[smoke ring]]).&lt;ref&gt;Turner, J. S. (1962). ''The Starting Plume in Neutral Surroundings'', J. Fluid Mech. vol 13, pp356-368&lt;/ref&gt;

==Types==
[[Pollutants]] released to the ground can work their way down into the [[groundwater]], leading to [[groundwater pollution]]. The resulting body of polluted water within an [[aquifer]] is called a plume, with its migrating edges called plume fronts. Plumes are used to locate, map, and measure [[water pollution]] within the aquifer's total body of water, and plume fronts to determine directions and speed of the contamination's spreading in it.&lt;ref&gt;Fetter, C.W. Jr 1998 Contaminant Hydrogeology&lt;/ref&gt;

Plumes are of considerable importance in the [[atmospheric dispersion modelling]] of [[air pollution]]. A classic work on the subject of air pollution plumes is that by Gary Briggs.&lt;ref&gt;Briggs, Gary A. (1975). ''Plume Rise Predictions'', Chapter 3 in ''Lectures on Air Pollution and Environmental Impact Analysis'',  Duanne A. Haugen, editor, Amer. Met. Soc.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|author=Beychok, Milton R.|title=[[Fundamentals Of Stack Gas Dispersion]]|edition=4th|publisher=author-published|year=2005|isbn=0-9644588-0-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''thermal plume''' is one which is generated by gas rising above heat source. The gas rises because [[thermal expansion]] makes warm gas less dense than the surrounding cooler gas.

==Simple plume modelling==
Quite simple modelling will enable many properties of fully developed, turbulent plumes to be investigated.&lt;ref&gt;Scase, M. M., Caulfield, C. P., Dalziel, S. B. &amp; Hunt, J. C. R. (2006). ''Time-dependent plumes and jets with decreasing source strengths'', J. Fluid Mech. vol 563, pp443-461&lt;/ref&gt;

# It is usually sufficient to assume that the pressure gradient is set by the gradient far from the plume (this approximation is similar to the usual [[Turbulence modeling#Eddy viscosity|Boussinesq approximation]]).
# The distribution of density and velocity across the plume are modelled either with simple Gaussian distributions or else are taken as uniform across the plume (the so-called 'top hat' model).
# The rate of entrainment into the plume is proportional to the local velocity.&lt;ref name="morton turb"&gt;Morton, B. R., Turner, J. S., and Taylor, G.I. (1956), ''Turbulent gravitational convection from maintained and instantaneous sources'', P. Roy. Soc. Lond., vol. 234, pp.1--&amp;&lt;/ref&gt;  Though initially thought to be a constant, recent work has shown that the entrainment coefficient varies with the local Richardson number.&lt;ref&gt;Kaminski, E. Tait, S. and Carazzo, G. (2005), ''Turbulent entrainment in jets with arbitrary buoyancy'', J. Fluid Mech., vol. 526, pp.361--376&lt;/ref&gt;  Typical values for the entrainment coefficient are of about 0.08 for vertical jets and 0.12 for vertical, buoyant plumes whilst for bent-over plumes, the entrainment coefficient is about 0.6.
# Conservation equations for mass (including entrainment), and momentum and buoyancy fluxes are sufficient for a complete description of the flow in many cases,&lt;ref name="morton turb"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Woods, A.W. (2010), ''Turbulent plumes in nature'', Annu. Rev. Fluid Mech., Vol. 42, pp. 391--412&lt;/ref&gt; For a simple rising plume these equations predict that the plume will widen at a constant half-angle of about 6 to 15 degrees.

==Gaussian plume modelling==
Gaussian plume models can be used in several fluid dynamics scenarios to calculate concentration distribution of solutes such as a smoke stack release or contaminant released in a river. Gaussian distributions are established by Fickian diffusion, and follow a gaussian (bell-shaped) distribution.&lt;ref name="connolly model"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://personalpages.manchester.ac.uk/staff/paul.connolly/teaching/practicals/gaussian_plume_modelling.html|title=Gaussian Plume Model|website=personalpages.manchester.ac.uk|last1=Connolly|first1=Paul|accessdate=25 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; For calculating the expected concentration of a one dimensional instantaneous point source we consider a mass M released at an instantaneous point in time, in a one dimensional domain along x. This will give the following equation:&lt;ref&gt;Heidi Nepf. ''1.061 Transport Processes in the Environment.'' Fall 2008. Massachusetts Institute of Technology: MIT OpenCourseWare, https://ocw.mit.edu License: Creative Commons BY-NC-SA.&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;math&gt;C(x,t)=M/\surd(4\pi*D*t) *exp((x-x0)^2/(4D(t-t0)) &lt;/math&gt;

where M is the mass released at time t=t0 and location x=x0, and D is the diffusivity [m^2/s]. This  equation makes the following four assumptions:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Mass Transport in Environmental Flows|last=Variano|first=Evan|publisher=UC Berkeley|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

# The mass M is released instantaneously.
# The mass M is released in an infinite domain.
# The mass spreads only through diffusion.
# Diffusion does not vary in space.&lt;ref name="connolly model"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="18950">'''Protein [[adsorption]]''' refers to the adhesion of [[protein]]s to solid surfaces.  This phenomenon is an important issue in the [[food processing industry]], particularly in [[milk processing]] and [[wine making|wine]] and [[beer making]].  Excessive adsorption, or protein fouling, can lead to health and sanitation issues, as the adsorbed protein is very difficult to clean and can harbor bacteria, as is the case in [[biofilm]]s.  Product quality can be adversely affected if the adsorbed material interferes with processing steps, like [[pasteurization]].  However, in some cases protein adsorption is used to improve food quality, as is the case in [[Finings|fining]] of wines.

==Protein adsorption==
Protein adsorption and protein fouling can cause major problems in the food industry (particularly the [[dairy industry]]) when proteins from food adsorb to processing surfaces, such as [[stainless steel]] or plastic (e.g. [[polypropylene]]). Protein fouling is the gathering of protein aggregates on a surface.  This is most common in heating processes that create a temperature gradient between the equipment and the bulk substance being heated.&lt;ref name= fouling&gt;{{cite journal | last = Ayadi | first = MA |author2=T Benezech  |author3=F Chopard  |author4=M Berthou  | title = Thermal Performance of a Flat Ohmic Cell Under Non-fouling and Whey Protein Fouling Conditions | journal = LWT-Food Science and Technology | year = 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In protein-fouled heating equipment, adsorbed proteins can create an insulating layer between the heater and the bulk material, reducing heating efficiency.  This leads to inefficient sterilization and pasteurization.  Also, proteins stuck to the heater may cause a burned taste or color in the bulk material.&lt;ref name= fouling /&gt;  Additionally, in processes that employ filtration, protein aggregates that gather on the surface of the filter can block the flow of the bulk material and greatly reduce filter efficiency.&lt;ref name= filter&gt;{{cite journal | last = Ho | first = Chia-Chi |author2=Andrew L. Zydney  | title = Protein Fouling of Asymmetric and Composite Microfiltration Membranes | journal = Ind. Eng. Chem. Res. | year = 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Examples of adsorption ==

===Beer stone===
[[Beerstone]] is a buildup that forms when oxalate, proteins, and calcium or magnesium salts from the grains and water in the beer brewing process precipitate and form scale on kegs, barrels and tap lines.  The minerals adsorb to the surface of the container first, driven by charge attractions. Proteins are often coordinated to these minerals in the solution and can bind with them to the surface. In other cases proteins also adsorb to the minerals on the surface, making deposits difficult to remove,&lt;ref name=beerstone&gt;{{cite magazine | last = Johnson | first = Dana | date = March 23, 1998| title = Removing Beerstone |url = http://www.birkocorp.com/brewery/white-papers/removing-beerstone-a-look-at-alternative-cleaning-methods/ | magazine = Modern Brewery Age |via=Birko Corporation}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as providing a surface that can easily harbor microorganisms.   If built-up beer stone inside tap lines flakes off, it can negatively affect the quality of the finished product by making beer hazy and contributing "off" flavors.  It is also harmful from a nutritional standpoint: oxalates can decrease absorption of calcium in the body, in addition to increasing risk of kidney stone formation.&lt;ref name=oxalate&gt;{{Cite journal  | last = McIntire | first = Donald B.  | title = Beer Lagering Process |journal = US Pat. No. 3,128,188  | year = 1964 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Wine making ===
Grape and [[wine protein]]s tend to aggregate and form hazes and sediment in finished wines, especially white wines.&lt;ref name=wine1&gt;{{cite book |title= Wine Chemistry and Biochemistry|last= Moreno-Arribas|first= M. Victoria|author2=Carmen Polo |author3=María Carmen Polo |year= 2009|publisher= Springer Science+Business Media |page= 213}}&lt;/ref&gt; Haze-causing proteins can persist in wine due to low settling velocities or charge repulsion on individual particles. Fining agents, such as [[bentonite]] clays, are used to clarify wine by removing these proteins.  Also, proteinaceous agents such as albumin, casein, or gelatin are used in wine clarification to remove tannins or other phenols.&lt;ref name=wine2&gt;{{cite book |title= Principles and Practices of Winemaking|last= Boulton|first= Roger B.|author2=Vernon L. Singleton |author3=Linda F. Bisson |year= 1996|publisher= Kluwer Academic Publishers Group |page= 279}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Biofilms===
A [[biofilm]] is a community of microorganisms adsorbed to a surface.  Microorganisms in biofilms are enclosed in a polymeric matrix consisting of exopolysaccharides, extracellular DNA and proteins.  Seconds after a surface (usually metal) is placed in a solution, inorganic and organic molecules adsorb onto the surface. These molecules are attracted mainly by Coulombic forces (see above section), and can adhere very strongly to the surface. This first layer is called the conditioning layer, and is necessary for the microorganisms to bind to the surface. These microorganisms then attach reversibly by [[Van der Waals force]]s, followed by irreversible adhesion through self-produced attachment structures such as pili or flagella.&lt;ref name=biofilm1&gt;{{cite book |title= Microbial Biofilms|last= Lappin-Scott|first= Hilary M. |author2=J. William Costerton |year= 1995|publisher= Cambridge University Press |page= 49}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Biofilms form on solid substrates such as stainless steel.  A biofilm's enclosing polymeric matrix offers protection to its microbes, increasing their resistance to detergents and cleaning agents.  Biofilms on food processing surfaces can be a biological hazard to food safety.  Increased chemical resistance in biofilms can lead to a persistent contamination condition.&lt;ref name=biofilm2&gt;{{Cite journal | last = Tarver  | first = Toni  | title = Biofilms: A Threat to Food Safety  | journal = Food Technology  | volume = 63  | issue = 2  | pages = 46–52  | year = 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Dairy industry===
[[File:Pasteurized milk.jpg|thumb|Pasteurized milk being held in bulk heating tank for cheese making.]]
Thermal treatment of milk by indirect heating (e.g. pasteurization) to reduce microbial load and increase shelf life is generally performed by a [[plate heat exchanger]].  Heat exchanger surfaces can become fouled by adsorbed milk protein deposits.  Fouling is initiated by formation of a protein monolayer at room temperature, followed by heat induced aggregation and deposition of [[whey protein]] and calcium phosphate deposits.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1= Visser|first1= J|last2= Jeurnink|first2= Th. J. M|year= 1997|title= Fouling of Heat Exchangers in the Dairy Industry|journal= Experimental Thermal and Fluid Science|volume= 14|issue= 4|pages= 407–424|doi=10.1016/s0894-1777(96)00142-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Adsorbed proteins decrease efficiency of heat transfer and potentially affect product quality by preventing adequate heating of milk.

==Mechanisms for protein adsorption==
The common trend in all examples of protein adsorption in the food industry is that of adsorption to minerals adsorbed to the surface first. This phenomenon has been studied but it is not well understood. [[Spectroscopy]] of proteins adsorbed onto clay-like minerals show variations in the C=O and N-H [[chemical bond|bond]] stretches, meaning that these bonds are involved in the protein binding.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Fusi|first1= P.| last2= Ristori|first2= G.G.| last3= Calamai| first3= L.|last4= Stotzky|first4=G.|year= 1989|title=Adsorption and Binding of Protein on "clean" (Homoionic) and "dirty" (coated with Fe oxyhydroxides) Montmorillonite, Illite and Kaolinite| journal= Soil Biology and Biochemistry| volume= 21| pages=911–920| doi=10.1016/0038-0717(89)90080-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Coulombic===
In some cases proteins are attracted to surfaces by an excessive [[surface charge]].  When a surface in a fluid has a net charge, ions in the fluid will adsorb to the surface.  Proteins also have charged surfaces due to charge amino acid residues on the surface of the protein. The surface and the protein are then attracted by Coulombic forces.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| last1= Andrade|first1= J.D. |last2= Hlady|first2= V.|last3= Wei| first3= A.P.| year=1992|title= Adsorption of Complex Proteins at Interfaces| journal=Pure Appl. Chem.| volume= 64| pages= 1777–1781| doi=10.1351/pac199264111777}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The attraction a protein feels from a charged surface (&lt;math&gt;\phi&lt;/math&gt;) depends exponentially on the surface's charge, as described by the following formula:&lt;ref name =surface&gt;{{cite book|title= Physics and Chemistry of Interfaces| last1= Butt| first1=Hans-Jurgen| last2=Graf| first2= Karlheinz| last3= Kappl| first3=Michael| year=2006| publisher=Wiley-VCH| location=Federal Republic of Germany}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\phi=\phi_0 e^{\frac{-x}{\lambda_D}}&lt;/math&gt;

Where 
* '''&lt;math&gt;\phi&lt;/math&gt;''' is the potential felt by the protein
* '''&lt;math&gt;\Phi_0&lt;/math&gt;''' is the actual potential of the surface
* '''x''' is the distance from the protein to the surface, and
* '''&lt;math&gt;\lambda_D&lt;/math&gt;''' is the [[Debye length]].

A protein's surface's potential is given by the number of charged amino acids it has and its [[isoelectric point]], pI.

===Thermodynamic===
Protein adsorption can also occur as a direct result of heating a mixture. Protein adsorption in milk processing is often used as a model for this type of adsorption in other situations. Milk is composed mainly of water, with less than 20% of suspended solids or dissolved proteins. Proteins make up only 3.6% of milk in total, and only 26% of the components that are not water.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wheyoflife.org/faq.cfm#1| title=Whey Protein FAQ's}}&lt;/ref&gt; These proteins are all responsible for fouling that occurs during [[pasteurization]].

[[File:Composition of Milk Pie Chart.svg|thumb|Composition of solids (non-water elements) in milk]]

As milk is heated during [[pasteurization]] many of the proteins in the milk are denatured. Pasteurization temperatures can reach 161&amp;nbsp;°F (71.7&amp;nbsp;°C). This temperature is high enough to denature the proteins below, lowering the nutritional value of the milk and causing fouling. Milk is heated to these high temperatures for a short time (15–20 seconds) to reduce the amount of [[denaturization]]. However fouling from denatured proteins is still a significant problem.  
{|class="wikitable" style="text-align:center

[[Denaturation (biochemistry)|Denaturation]] exposes hydrophobic amino acid residues in the protein, which had been previously protected by the protein. The exposed hydrophobic amino acids decrease the entropy of the water surrounding them, making it favorable for surface adsorption. Some of the β-lactoglobulin (β-lg) will adsorb directly onto the surface of a heat exchanger or container. Other denatured β-lg molecules adsorb to casein [[micelles]], which are also present in the milk. As more and more β-lg proteins bind to the casein micelle it forms an aggregate, which will then diffuse to the heat exchanger and/or surface of the container. 
[[File:Denatrued_Adsorption.png|thumb|Mechanism of denaturing protein adsorption]]

===Biochemical===
While the aggregates can explain much of the protein fouling found in milk processing, this does not account for it all.  A third type of fouling has been discovered that is explained by the chemical interactions of the denatured β-lg proteins.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| last1=Nakanishi|first1=Kazuhiro|last2=Sakiyama|first2=Takaharu|last3=Imamura|first3=Koreyoshi| title=Review On the Adsorption of Proteins on Solid Surfaces, a Common but Very Complicated Phenomenon| year=2001| journal=Journal of Bioscience and Bioengineering| volume=91| pages=233–244| doi=10.1016/s1389-1723(01)80127-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

β-lg contains 5 [[cysteine]] residues, four of which are covalently bonded to each other, forming an S-S bond.  When β-lg is denatured, the fifth [[cysteine]] residue is exposed to the water. This residue then bonds to other β-lg proteins, including those already adsorbed to the surface. This produces a strong interaction between the denatured proteins and the surface of the container.

==Isotherms==
Isotherms are used to quantify the amount of adsorbed protein on a surface at a constant temperature, depending on the concentration of protein above the surface.  Researchers have used a Langmuir-type isotherm model to describe experimental values for protein adsorption.&lt;ref name=Isotherm&gt;{{cite journal |last1= Al-Malah|first1= Kamal|last2= McGuire|first2=Joseph|last3= Sproul|first3= Robert| year= 1995 | title=A Macroscopic Mocel for the Single-Component Protein Adsorption Isotherm| journal=Journal of Colloid and Interface Science| volume= 170 |pages= 261–268 | doi=10.1006/jcis.1995.1096}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\Gamma=\frac{V_pC_e}{A_pe^{\frac{W_aA_c}{RT}+V_pC_e}}&lt;/math&gt;

In this equation 
* '''&lt;math&gt;\Gamma&lt;/math&gt;''' is the amount of adsorbed protein
* '''&lt;math&gt;A_c&lt;/math&gt;''' is the surface area per molecule
* '''&lt;math&gt;V_p&lt;/math&gt;''' is the partial molar volume of protein
* '''&lt;math&gt;W_a&lt;/math&gt;''' is the negative of the Gibbs Free Energy of adsorption per unit area and
* '''&lt;math&gt;C_e&lt;/math&gt;''' is the equilibrium protein concentration.

This equation has been applied to a laboratory setting of protein adsorption at temperatures higher than 50&amp;nbsp;°C from a model solution of protein and water. It is especially useful for modeling protein fouling in milk processing.

== Removal of adsorbed proteins ==
Adsorbed proteins are among the most difficult food soils to remove from food contact surfaces.  In particular, heat-denatured proteins (such as those found in dairy industry applications) adhere tightly to surfaces and require strong alkaline cleaners for removal.&lt;ref name = marriott&gt;{{cite book |title= Principles of Food Sanitation|last= Marriott|first= Norman G.|author2=Robert B. Gravani |year=2006 |publisher= Springer Science+Business Media|location= New York|page= 142}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It is important that cleaning methods are capable of removing both visible and non-visible protein soils.  Nutrients for bacterial growth must be removed as well as biofilms that may have built up on the food contact surface.  Proteins are water-insoluble, slightly soluble in acidic solutions and soluble in alkaline solutions, which limits the type of cleaner that can be used to remove protein from the surface.&lt;ref name=marriott/&gt;  Generally speaking, highly alkaline cleaners with peptizing and wetting agents are most effective in protein removal on food contact surfaces.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://edis.ifas.ufl.edu/fs077|title= Basic Elements of Equipment Cleaning and Sanitizing in Food Processing and Handling Operations|author= Ronald H. Schmidt|date= July 1997|publisher= Food Science and Human Nutrition Department, Florida Cooperative Extension Service, Institute of Food and Agricultural Sciences, University of Florida|accessdate=May 22, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Cleaning temperature is also a concern for effective protein removal.  As temperature increases, the activity of the cleaning compound increases, making soil removal easier.  However, at higher temperatures (&gt; 55&amp;nbsp;°C) proteins denature and cleaning efficacy is reduced.&lt;ref name = marriott/&gt;

===Alkaline cleaners===
Alkaline cleaners are classified as compounds with pH 7-14.  Proteins are most effectively removed from surfaces by cleaners with a pH of 11 or higher.&lt;ref name=marriott/&gt;  An example of a strong alkaline cleaning agent is [[sodium hydroxide]], also called caustic soda.  Although sodium hydroxide (NaOH) can cause corrosion on food contact surfaces such as stainless steel, it is the preferred cleaning agent for protein removal due to its efficacy in dissolving proteins and dispersing/emulsifying food soils.  Silicates are often added to these cleaners to reduce corrosion on metal surfaces.  The mechanism of alkaline cleaning action in proteins follows a three-step process:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1= Fryer|first1= P J|last2= Christian |first2= G K | last3 = Liu | first3 = W|year= 2006|title= How Hygiene Happens: physics and chemistry of cleaning |journal= International Journal of Dairy Technology |volume= 59|issue= 2|pages= 76–84 |doi=10.1111/j.1471-0307.2006.00249.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;
# Gel formation:  Upon contact with the alkaline solution, the protein soil swells and forms a removable gel.
# Protein removal:  The protein gel is removed through mass transfer, while the cleaning agent continues to diffuse through the soil, increasing gel formation.
# Decay stage:  The protein gel has been eroded to the point where it is a thin deposit.  Removal at this stage is governed by shear stress forces and mass transfer of the gel.
[[Hypochlorite]] is often added to alkaline cleaners to peptize proteins.  Chlorinated cleansers work by oxidizing sulfide crosslinks in proteins.&lt;ref name = marriott/&gt;  Cleaning speed and efficiency is improved due to increased diffusion of the cleaner into the soil matrix, now composed of smaller, more soluble proteins.

===Enzyme cleaners===
[[File:Enzyme mechanism 1.jpg|thumb|Basic mechanism of enzyme action]]
Enzyme-based cleaners are especially useful for biofilm removal.  Bacteria are somewhat difficult to remove with traditional alkaline or acid cleaners.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1= Flint|first1= S H |last2= van den Elzen|first2= H | last3 = Brooks | first3 = J D | last4 = Bremer | first4 = P J|year= 1999|title= Removal and inactivation of thermo-resistant streptococci colonising stainless steel|journal=International Dairy Journal|volume= 9|issue= 7|pages= 429–436 | doi=10.1016/s0958-6946(99)00048-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Enzyme cleaners are more effective on biofilms since they work as proteases by breaking down proteins at bacterial attachment sites.  They work at maximum efficiency at high pH and at temperatures below 60&amp;nbsp;°C.&lt;ref name = marriott/&gt;  Enzyme cleaners are an increasingly attractive alternative to traditional chemical cleaners because of biodegradability and other environmental factors, such as reduced wastewater generation and energy savings from using cold water.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last1= Palmowski|first1=L |last2= Baskaran|first2= K | last3 = Wilson | first3 = H | last4 = Watson | first4 = B|title= Clean in Place – A Review of Current Technology and its Use in the Food and Beverage Industry | year = 2005 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  However, they are typically more expensive than alkaline or acid cleaners.

'''Protistology''' is a scientific discipline devoted to the study of [[protists]], a highly diverse group of [[Microorganism#Eukaryotes|eukaryotic]] organisms. Its field of study overlaps with more traditional disciplines of [[phycology]], [[mycology]], and [[protozoology]], just as protists, which, being a [[paraphyletic group]] embrace [[algae]], some organisms regarded previously as primitive [[fungi]], and [[protozoa]] ("animal" motile protists lacking chloroplasts).

==History==
As the term "[[protozoology]]" has become dated as our understanding of the evolutionary relationships of the eukaryotes has improved, the term "protistology" become more common. For example, the Society of Protozoologists, founded in 1947, was renamed International Society of Protistologists in 2005. However, the older term persists in some cases (e.g., the Polish journal Acta Protozoologica).

==Journals and societies==

The mission of the Research Centre is to develop and expand Polish research in the region, particularly in [[Nile|the Nile Valley]]. It is operated by the [[Polish Centre of Mediterranean Archaeology]], an independent research institute of the [[University of Warsaw]]. The PCMA Cairo Research Centre is located in two buildings situated in close proximity to one another in the Cairo [[Heliopolis (ancient Egypt)|Heliopolis]] district — in antiquity the centre of a religious cult and the location of the Egypt's reputedly largest temple.

== History ==
Polish archaeologists first started to work in [[Egypt]] during the times of the [[Second Polish Republic]] (1918-1939). [[Kazimierz Michałowski]], the founder of the Polish school of Mediterranean archaeology, initiated Polish research in Egypt, and joined as a field director a project of the [[Institut Français d'Archéologie Orientale|French Institute for Oriental Archaeology]] in Cairo (IFAO) at [[Edfu]].&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Od Edfu do Faras|last=Michałowski|first=Kazimierz|publisher=Wydawnictwa Artystyczne i Filmowe|year=1983|isbn=|location=Warsaw|pages=10, 18}}&lt;/ref&gt; The excavation was suspended after three seasons because of the outbreak of [[World War II|WWII]]. Twenty years later, despite the tense political situation in the Middle East, Polish archaeologists were back in Egypt. In 1956, they were granted a concession to explore [[Athribis|Tell Atrib]] in the suburbs of [[Banha|Benha]],&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.pcma.uw.edu.pl/pl/wydarzenia/niepodpiete/stulecie-urodzin-k-michalowskiego/|title=Profesor Kazimierz Michałowski i polska szkoła archeologii śródziemnomorskiej|last=Pawlicki|first=Franciszek|date=|website=Polish Centre of Mediterranean Archaeology, University of Warsaw|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2017-06-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; but work did not begin until a year later due to the [[Suez Crisis]].&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite book|title=50 lat polskich wykopalisk w Egipcie i na Bliskim Wschodzie|last=Daszewski|first=Wiktor Andrzej|publisher=|year=1986|isbn=|location=|pages=|chapter=25 lat istnienia Stacji Archeologii Śródziemnomorskiej Uniwersytetu Warszawskiego}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1959 Professor Michałowski established the Polish Centre of Mediterranean Archaeology of the University of Warsaw in Cairo, which is still operated today under the name Research Center in Cairo.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Polish archaeologists facing new archaeological tasks, such as coordination of new research, preparing for publication the results of the excavations, contributing to the international [[UNESCO]] campaign to save [[Nubia]]n archaeological heritage, greatly benefitted from having a permanent location in Egypt&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

In 1960 Polish archaeologists began excavations in [[Alexandria]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Seventy Years of Polish Archaeology in Egypt|last=Kiss|first=Zolt|publisher=Polish Centre of Mediterranean Archaeology, University of Warsaw|year=2007|isbn=|location=|pages=117|chapter=Alexandria. Past research}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1961–1964, led by Michałowski, they became an important part of the UNESCO campaign to save the archaeological heritage of [[Nubia]], which was to be inundated by the waters of the newly created artificial [[Lake Nasser]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://culture.pl/pl/artykul/skarby-faras-ukryte-w-piaskach-pustyni|title=Skarby Faras ukryte w piaskach pustyni|last=Sural|first=Agnieszka|date=|website=culture.pl|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2017-11-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''"Poles hit the Nubian lottery jackpot",'' reported the international press about the Polish discoveries at [[Faras]].&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Even as the first season of excavation at Faras was in full swing, Michałowski was approached by the Egyptian authorities to take on the task of completing the restoration of the Upper Terrace of the [[Mortuary Temple of Hatshepsut|Temple of Hatshepsut]] in [[Luxor]]. The work in [[Deir el-Bahari]] began in 1961.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Seventy Years of Polish Archaeology in Egypt|last=Szafrański|first=Zbigniew|publisher=Polish Centre of Mediterranean Archaeology, University of Warsaw|year=2007|isbn=|location=|pages=93|chapter=Deir el-Bahari. Temple of Hatshepsut}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1963, Michałowski headed the international committee of experts created by the Egyptian government to rescue the [[Abu Simbel temples|rock temples of Abu Simbel]].&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

The Polish Centre in Cairo was named after its founder by the Senate of the [[University of Warsaw]] on 21 December 1983.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=50 lat polskich wykopalisk w Egipcie i na Bliskim Wschodzie|last=Białkowski|first=Grzegorz|publisher=|year=1986|isbn=|location=|pages=|chapter=Wstęp}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its establishment and development into a reputed international archaeological institution is considered among his greatest achievements.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Sadurska|first=Anna|date=1981|title=Nekrologi|url=|journal=Archaeologia|volume=32|pages=244|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; After all, "''the current level of culture in any country is measured by whether it runs its own excavations in Egypt,"'' Michałowski used to say.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The 1980s saw a rapid development of archaeological research with the opening of new sites in Egypt as well as in other countries of the Middle East. This resulted in an administrative reorganization in 1986. The head office was moved to Warsaw, establishing the [[Polish Centre of Mediterranean Archaeology]] of the University of Warsaw in Warsaw in charge of supervising the Research Centre in Cairo as its main branch, as well as all the Polish archaeological missions in the Eastern Mediterranean, the Near East and Northeastern Africa.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

In 2017, there was a dozen or so Polish archaeological missions working in Egypt. Every year several hundred Polish researchers of different specialties, not only archaeologists, from different Polish and foreign scientific institutions participate in research in Egypt.

== Objectives ==
The objectives of the Research Centre in Cairo are as follows:
* to ensure the efficient progress of archaeological and restoration work carried out by Polish missions in Egypt;
* to represent Polish researchers, archaeologists and conservators, to the Egyptian authorities responsible for antiquities, most of all the Ministry of Antiquities, as well as to other archaeological units in Egypt;
* to develop and popularize knowledge, by organizing public lectures and seminars presenting archaeological research in Egypt and Polish achievements in this field, as well as running a reference library allowing the Centre's residents and visitors to access to publications on archaeology and history of the Middle East;
* to provide support for a scholarship program of the Ministry of Science and Higher Education of the Republic of Poland, granted to students, graduates and PhD candidates.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.pcma.uw.edu.pl/pl/stacja-badawcza-w-kairze/|title=Stacja Badawcze w Kairze|last=|first=|date=|website=Polish Centre of Mediterranean Archaeology|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2017-11-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Directors of the Research Centre in Cairo Directors ==
Prior to the establishment of the Polish Centre in Warsaw, the Polish Centre in Cairo was headed by:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.egiptologia.pl/polskie-centrum-archeologii-srodziemnomorskiej-uw/|title=Polska Stacja Badawcza w Kairze|last=Juszczyk-Futkowska|first=K.|date=|website=egiptologia.pl|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2017-11-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Kazimierz Michałowski (1959–1981)
* Zofia Sztetyłło (Acting Director, 1981)
* Waldemar Chmielewski (1982)
* Wiktor Andrzej Daszewski (1982–1991)
* Michał Gawlikowski (1991–2005)
Since 2005 the Research Center in Cairo has its own Director, subordinated to the Director of the Polish Centre in Warsaw. This office has been held by:
* [[Zbigniew Szafrański|Zbigniew E. Szafrański]] (2005–2015)
* Artur Obłuski (2015 –).

== Polish archaeological missions in Egypt ==
* Polish-Egyptian Archaeological and Conservation Mission at Kom el-Dikka in [[Alexandria]], since 1960. One of the main quarters of the ancient city located in the center of the modern town is among the greatest discoveries of Polish archaeologists in Egypt. Preserving non-stop occupation from the city's founding in the 3rd century BC through the medieval 13th- – 14th-century Islamic burial ground, the site that is visited today as an archaeological park open to tourists encompasses buildings from the 4th through 6th centuries AD, including the oldest known ruins of an institution of higher learning (Alexandria's ancient academy) composed of lecture halls, an assembly hall vel theater or rather odeon, a late Roman imperial bathhouse and a habitation quarter of houses and workshops. Kom el-Dikka is the largest and the most important archaeological site in Alexandria.

The site is a settlement on three mounds, located on a major trade route passing through the Nile Delta to the Mediterranean coast and Syria. Its peak development can be dated to the [[Amratian culture|Nagada period]]. Of highest significance among the discoveries are two golden statues of presumed rulers from the pre-Dynastic period, indicating that the site was a power center of some substance in this part of Egypt, before its decline about the time of the unification of Upper and Lower Egypt, resulting from changing trade routes and the increased importance of water transport.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.farkha.org/english/stanowisko.html|title=Tell el-Farkha archaeological site|last=|first=|date=|website=Polish Archaeological Expedition to the Eastern Nile Delta - Tell el-Farkha|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2017-11-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* Polish Archaeological Mission at Naqlun (Deir el-Malak) in [[Faiyum Oasis|Fayum Oasis]], research since 1986 in a monastic complex established in the 5th century and still functional today. The site comprises scattered hermitages, a central compound of extended monastic buildings, church, refuse dump and two cemeteries, one from the 6th and the other a large medieval Christian cemetery of the 12th–13th century. Finds include pottery, burial textiles, basketry and many others. The written documents: letters, codices, literary texts, psalms and fragments of Gospels, in [[Coptic language|Coptic]], Greek, Arabic and Latin, are evidence of monastic continuity and the level of the monks’ education.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Seventy Years of Polish Archaeology in Egypt|last=Godlewski|first=Włodzimierz|publisher=Polish Centre of Mediterranean Archaeology, University of Warsaw|year=2007|isbn=|location=|pages=176|chapter=Naqlun}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Polish–Egyptian Archaeological and Conservation Mission at the Temple of [[Hatshepsut]] at [[Deir el-Bahari]], operating since 1961.

One of the most interesting finds are fragments of linen with ink-painted hieroglyphs, a gift of [[Ptolemy XII Auletes|Ptolemy XII]], the father of [[Cleopatra]], for the nearby temple at [[Deir el-Medina]].
* Polish–American Mission in [[Baris, Egypt|Berenike]] and the Eastern Desert, excavations since 2008 in the Hellenistic and Roman ruins of the Red Sea port. The port was built in the 3rd century BC, a prime purpose being the import of elephants from eastern Africa for the needs of the Ptolemaic armies.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://wyborcza.pl/7,75400,21114289,niezwykle-cmentarzysko-zwierzat-domowych-sprzed-2000-lat.html|title=Niezwykłe cmentarzysko zwierząt domowych sprzed 2000 lat|last=Grabowska|first=Joanna|date=13 December 2016|work=Wyborcza|access-date=2017-11-19|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The harbor was an important stop on the major Greek and Roman trade routes to India, from where spices and precious stones were brought, and probably China, from where silk was imported. Incense and myrrh were brought from Arabia. The goods were transported by land from the port to Coptos on the Nile (modern Qift), and then by water to the Nile Delta and further to [[Rome]]. A cemetery of animals (cats, dogs, monkeys) is being excavated on the outskirts of the harbor.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

[[File:SheelaWiki.jpg|thumb|right|A 12th-century sheela na gig on the [[SS Mary and David's Church, Kilpeck|church]] at [[Kilpeck]], [[Herefordshire]], England]]
[[File:Sheela na gig, St. Magnus Cathedral, Kirkwall.jpg|thumb|Sheela na gig on the south-west pillar of the presbytery in [[St Magnus Cathedral|St. Magnus Cathedral]], Kirkwall, Orkney, ca. twelfth-thirteenth centuries, [[Norman architecture|Norman]] and [[Romanesque architecture|Romanesque]]]]

'''Sheela na gigs''' are figurative carvings of naked women displaying an exaggerated [[vulva]]. They are [[grotesque#In architecture|architectural grotesques]] found all over [[Europe]]&lt;ref name=Andersen/&gt;&lt;ref name=Weir/&gt; on [[church (building)|churches]], [[castles]], and other buildings. The highest concentrations can be found in Ireland, Great Britain, France and Spain, sometimes together with male figures. Ireland has the greatest number of surviving sheela na gig carvings; McMahon and Roberts cite 101 examples in Ireland and 45 examples in Britain.&lt;ref name=McMahon&gt;McMahon, J. &amp; Roberts, J. ''The Sheela-na-Gigs of Ireland and Britain: The Divine Hag of the Christian Celts – An Illustrated Guide,'' Mercier Press Ltd. (2000) {{ISBN|978-1-85635-294-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; One of the best examples may be found in the [[Irish round tower|Round Tower]] at [[Rattoo]], in [[County Kerry]], Ireland.  There is a replica of the Round Tower sheela na gig in the County Museum in [[Tralee]] town. Another well-known example may be seen at [[Kilpeck]] in [[Herefordshire]], England.

The carvings may have been used to ward off death and evil.&lt;ref name=Andersen&gt;Andersen, Jorgen ''The Witch on the Wall'' (1977) Rosenkilde &amp; Bagger {{ISBN|978-87-423-0182-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Weir&gt;Weir, Anthony &amp; Jerman, James [https://books.google.com/books?id=lvgHL_LQ4H8C&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;source=gbs_similarbooks_s&amp;cad=1#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false Images of Lust: Sexual Carvings on Medieval Churches], London: B. T. Batsford Ltd, 1986&lt;/ref&gt; Other [[grotesque]]s, such as [[gargoyle]]s and [[hunky punk]]s, were frequently part of church decorations all over [[Europe]]. It is commonly said that their purpose was to keep [[Demon|evil spirits]] away (see [[apotropaic magic]]). They often are positioned over doors or windows, presumably to protect these openings.

==Origin==
Scholars disagree about the origins of the figures. James Jerman and Anthony Weir believe that the sheela na gigs were first carved in France and Spain in the 11th century; the motif eventually reached Britain and then Ireland in the 12th century.&lt;ref name=Weir/&gt; Jerman and Weir's work was a continuation of research begun by Jorgen Andersen, who wrote ''The Witch on the Wall'' (1977), the first serious book on sheela na gigs.&lt;ref name=Andersen/&gt; Eamonn Kelly, Keeper of Irish Antiquities at the [[National Museum of Ireland]] in Dublin, draws attention to the distribution of sheela na gigs in Ireland to support Weir and Jerman's theory;&lt;ref name=Kelly&gt;Kelly, Éamonn ''Sheela Na Gigs. Origins And Function,'' Country House (1996) {{ISBN|978-0-946172-51-1}}.&lt;/ref&gt; almost all of the surviving ''in situ'' sheela na gigs are found in areas of [[Anglo-Normans|Anglo-Norman]] conquest (12th century). The areas that remained "native Irish" have few sheela na gigs.&lt;ref name=Kelly/&gt; Weir and Jerman also argue that their location on churches and the grotesque features of the figures, by [[Middle Ages|medieval]] standards, suggests that they represented female [[lust]] as hideous and [[sin]]fully corrupting.&lt;ref name=Weir/&gt;

Another theory, espoused by Joanne McMahon and Jack Roberts, is that the carvings are remnants of a pre-Christian [[Fertility rite|fertility]] or [[mother goddess]] religion.&lt;ref name=McMahon/&gt; They note what they claim are differences in materials and styles of some sheela na gigs from their surrounding structures, and noting that some are turned on their side, to support the idea that they were incorporated from previous structures into [[early Christian]] buildings.

In addition, typical [[Continental Europe|continental]] exhibitionist figures differ from those of Irish sheela na gigs. There is a scarcity of male figures in Ireland and the UK, while the continental carvings are more likely to involve male figures. Continental figures also are represented in more contortionist postures.

[[File:Sheelanagigfethardwall.jpg|thumb|right|Sheela na gig on town wall in [[Fethard, County Tipperary]], [[Ireland]]]]

==Etymology==
The name was first published in the ''Proceedings of the Royal Irish Academy'' 1840–44, as a local name for a carving once present on a church [[gable]] wall in Rochestown, County Tipperary, Ireland; the name also was recorded in 1840 by John O'Donovan, an official of the [[Ordnance Survey]] of Ireland, referring to a figure on [[Kiltinan Castle]], County Tipperary.&lt;ref name=Andersen/&gt; Scholars disagree about the origin and meaning of the name in Ireland, as it is not directly translatable into [[Irish language|Irish]]. Alternative spellings of "Sheela" may sometimes be encountered; they include ''Sheila'', ''Síle'' and ''Síla''.&lt;ref name=McMahon/&gt;&lt;ref name=Andersen/&gt;&lt;ref name=Freitag/&gt; According to the ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]'', it is derived from Irish, ''Síle na gcíoch'', meaning "Julia of the breasts".&lt;ref&gt;''OED Online'' 2003 – The Dictionary spells the name hyphenated, "Sheela-na-gig"&lt;/ref&gt;

The name "Seán-na-Gig" was coined by Jack Roberts for the [[phallus|ithyphallic]] male counterpart of the Sheela. While rare in Ireland, it is much more common on the continent.&lt;ref name=Weir/&gt;

Jørgen Andersen writes that the name is an Irish phrase, originally either ''Sighle na gCíoch'', meaning "the [[old hag]] of the breasts", or ''Síle ina Giob'', meaning "Sheila (from the Irish ''Síle,'' the Irish form of the Anglo-Norman name Cecile or Cecilia) on her hunkers".&lt;ref name=Andersen/&gt; [[Patrick S. Dinneen|Dinneen]] also gives ''Síle na gCíoċ'', stating it is "a stone fetish representing a woman, supposed to give fertility, gnly [= ''generally''] thought to have been introduced by the Normans."&lt;ref&gt;Dinneen, Patrick. ''Foclóir Gaeḋlge agus Béarla,'' Dublin: Irish Texts Society, 1927&lt;/ref&gt; Other researchers have questioned these interpretations;&lt;ref name=Weir/&gt; few sheela na gigs are shown with breasts, and expressed doubt about the linguistic connection between ''ina Giob'' and ''na Gig''. The phrase "sheela na gig" was said to be a term for a hag or old woman.&lt;ref name=Freitag&gt;Freitag, Barbara. ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=Y03UDxXyOb8C&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false Sheela-na-gigs: Unravelling an Enigma]'' (2004) {{ISBN|0-415-34552-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Barbara Freitag]] devotes a chapter to the [[etymology]] of the name in her book, ''Sheela-Na-Gigs: Unravelling an Enigma.'' She documents references earlier than 1840, including a [[Royal Navy]] ship, ''Sheela Na Gig,'' and an 18th-century dance called the Sheela na gig. Irish slip jig, first published as "The Irish Pot Stick" (c.1758), appears as "Shilling a Gig" in Brysson's ''A Curious Collection of Favourite Tunes'' (1791) and "Sheela na Gigg" in Hime's ''48 Original Irish Dances'' (c.1795).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://listserv.heanet.ie/cgi-bin/wa?A2=ind9710&amp;L=IRTRAD-L&amp;D=0&amp;P=89253 |title=IRTRAD archives |publisher=Listserv.heanet.ie |date=1997-10-22 |accessdate=2013-03-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; These are the oldest recorded references to the name,&lt;ref name=Freitag/&gt; but do not apply to the architectural figures. The Royal Navy's records indicate the name refers to an "Irish female sprite".&lt;ref name=Freitag/&gt; Freitag discovered that "gig" was a [[Northern England English|Northern English]] slang word for a woman's genitals. A similar word in modern Irish slang "Gigh" (pronounced {{IPA-ga|ɡʲiː|}}) also exists, further confusing the possible origin of the name.

Weir and Jerman use the name sheela for the figure because it had entered popular usage; they also call figures of both sexes "[[Exhibitionism|exhibitionist]]".&lt;ref name=Weir/&gt; They cite Andersen's second chapter as a good discussion of the name.&lt;ref name=Andersen/&gt; Andersen says there is no evidence that "sheela na gig" was ever a popular name for the figures when they were created. It arose during the mid-19th century "where popular understanding of the characteristics of a sheela were vague and people were wary of its apparent rudeness". An earlier reference to the dubious nature of the name is made by H.C. Lawlor in an article in ''Man'' Vol. 31, Jan 1931 (Royal Anthropological Institute of Great Britain and Ireland), in which he writes, "The term "sheela-na-gig" has no etymological meaning and is an absurd name." Andersen, Weir and Jerman, and Freitag all dismiss the name as being modern and somewhat arbitrary.&lt;ref name=Andersen/&gt;&lt;ref name=Weir/&gt;&lt;ref name=Freitag/&gt;

The oldest recorded name for one of the figures is "The Idol," which relates to the Binstead figure on the [[Isle of Wight]]. This name was mentioned by R. Worsley in his ''The History of the Isle of Wight'' (1781) and noted also by J. Albin in ''A New, Correct, and Much-improved History of the Isle of Wight'' (1795) (Andersen page 11). The name "The Idol" also was applied to a now lost figure in [[Lusk, Dublin|Lusk, Ireland]] and was recorded as being in use around 1783.&lt;ref name=Andersen/&gt;

==Hypotheses==
Much of the disagreement among scholars about these figures focuses on determining exactly what they are meant to represent, and no theory explains all the figures.

===Survival of a pagan goddess===
A popular hypothesis is that sheela na gigs represent a pagan goddess, but academics believe the situation was more complex, with multiple interpretations and roles for the female character as spiritual traditions changed over time.&lt;ref name=Andersen/&gt;&lt;ref name=Weir/&gt;&lt;ref name=Freitag/&gt; The goddess in question usually is identified as Celtic, the hag-like ''[[Cailleach]]'' figure of Irish and Scottish mythology. [[Margaret Murray]] proposed this, as did Anne Ross, who wrote in her essay, "The Divine Hag of the Pagan Celts", "I would like to suggest that in their earliest iconographic form they do in fact portray the territorial or war-goddess in her hag-like aspect..."

[[Mircea Eliade]]'s ''The Encyclopedia of Religion'' (1993) draws parallels between the sheela na gig and the ancient Irish myth of the goddess who granted kingship. She would appear as a lustful hag, and most men would refuse her advances, except for one man who accepted. When he slept with her, she was transformed into a beautiful maiden who would confer royalty onto him and bless his reign. There are additional variants of this common [[Northern European]] [[Motif (narrative)|motif]] (see "[[Loathly lady]]").&lt;ref&gt;Mircea Eliade, editor (1993) ''The Encyclopedia of Religion'', New York: Macmillan, for the University of Chicago {{ISBN|978-0-02897-135-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Andersen devotes a chapter to this theory, entitled "Pagan or Medieval." While suggesting possible pagan influences on Irish sheela na gigs, he firmly places them in a medieval context.&lt;ref name=Andersen/&gt; He argues that pagan origins are less likely than influence from the continent during the medieval period: "What can be said against it, is that it is less easily proved and can be less easily illustrated than the possible continental, French origin for the motif discussed in earlier chapters...." (''The Witch on the Wall,'' p.&amp;nbsp;95).

Weir and Jerman explore the possible influence of the [[Baubo]] figurine on the motif, but they acknowledge that the link is tenuous. They write, "It makes for very interesting speculation, but the amount of evidence is not large".&lt;ref name=Weir/&gt;

Freitag explores possible Celtic pagan origins, but finds little to suggest a link "...in particular the notion of the divine hag being a portrayal of the Ur-Sheela has to be firmly dismissed as wayward conjecture." (''Sheela na gigs: Unravelling an Enigma,'' page 41). Although scholars have used evidence to reject the theory, it is popularly held.

===Fertility figure===
This hypothesis usually is combined with the "goddess" explanation for the figures discussed above. Barbara Freitag suggests that the figures were used in a fertility context and associates them with "birthing stones".&lt;ref name=Freitag/&gt; There is folkloric evidence of at least some of the sheela na gigs being used in this manner, with the figures being loaned out to women in labour.&lt;ref name=Freitag/&gt; Other figures have wedding traditions associated with them. According to Margaret Murray, the figure in [[Oxford]] at the church of [[St Michael at the North Gate]] has an associated tradition of being shown to brides on their wedding day.&lt;ref&gt;Murray, Margaret. "Female Fertility Figures," in ''Journal of the Royal Anthropological Institute,'' Vol. LXIV (1934)&lt;/ref&gt; This theory does not cover all the figures: some are thin with their ribs showing and thin breasts, which do not signal fertility.&lt;ref name=Connor&gt;O'Connor, James. ''Sheela na gig'', Fethard Historical Society,  1991&lt;/ref&gt; Others are plump and are shown in a sexual context with a partner (as  at [[Whittlesford]]). Theresa Oakley and Alex Woodcock recently discovered an exhibitionist couple at [[Devizes]], who seem to represent fertility. The faces of some figures are striated, indicating scarring or tattoos.&lt;ref name=Andersen/&gt; Weir notes that a close examination of the figures reveals features that do not fit a fertility function.&lt;ref name=Weir/&gt;

===Warning against lust===
Weir and Jerman suggested that the sheela na gigs served to warn against lust.&lt;ref name=Weir/&gt; They see the figures as a religious warning against sins of the flesh. Exhibitionist figures of all types—male, female, and bestial—are frequently found in the company of images of beasts devouring people and other hellish images. These images, they argue, were used as a means of religious instruction to a largely illiterate populace. As part of this interpretation, they explore a continental origin for the figures. Andersen first suggested this origin, and Weir and Jerman continued and expanded this line of inquiry. They argue that the motif migrated from the continent via the [[Pilgrimage#Christianity|pilgrim routes]] to and from [[Santiago de Compostella]]. (Freitag argues against this.) Pilgrim sculptors took notes of what they had seen on the route and ended up carving their own interpretations of the motifs. Eventually, the exhibitionist motif was carried to Ireland and Britain. This theory seems to accommodate many of the religious figures but relates less well to some of the secular ones. Images carved on castles would not seem to be serving a religious purpose. The figure at [[Haddon Hall]] appears on a stable (although this may have been moved from elsewhere). The theory does not cover all the figures.

===Protection against evil===

Andersen&lt;ref name=Andersen/&gt; and Weir and Jerman think the figures may also have been used as protection against evil.&lt;ref name=Weir/&gt; This would cover the use of the figures on structures such as castles. They served an [[apotropaic magic|apotropaic]] function, designed to ward off evil. In Ireland, some of the figures were called "The [[Evil eye|Evil Eye]] Stones," which supported their theory. There is also some folkloric evidence of [[anasyrma]] being used by women lifting up their dresses to curse [[evil spirits]]. Andersen reproduces an 18th-century illustration by [[Charles-Dominique-Joseph Eisen|Charles Eisen]] from [[Jean de La Fontaine|La Fontaine]]'s ''Nouveaux Contes'' (1764) showing a demon being repulsed by the sight of a woman lifting her skirt to display her genitals. Weir and Jerman relate a story from ''[[The Irish Times]]'' (23 September 1977) in which a potentially violent incident involving several men was averted by a woman exposing her genitals to them. But, they also doubt if the story was true. Weir and Jerman go on to suggest that the [[:wikt:apotropaic|apotropaic]] function seems to have been gradually ascribed to the figures over time. While this theory seems to fit most of the secular and some of the religious figures, it does not apply to all of them.

===Feminist reinterpretation of the image===
The rise of [[Feminist theory|feminist scholarship]] has reinterpreted the concept of the Sheela-na-gig especially in terms of the image as evil or embodiment of sin. Feminists have adopted the image as an icon with feminist authors viewing the sexuality of the Sheela na gig in a more positive light, an empowering figure. Reverence for female sexuality and [[vulva]]s can be seen in the art of [[Judy Chicago]]'s ''[[The Dinner Party]]'' and ''[[The Vagina Monologues]]'' by [[Eve Ensler]]. In ''Wide-open to Mirth and Wonder'', Luz Mar González-Arias argues that the creative re-imagining of this medieval female figure can "encourage contemporary women to stop perceiving their own corporeality as a heavy, awkward and shameful burden of guilt".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Arias|first1=Luz Mar González|title=Wide-open to Mirth and Wonder: Twentieth-Century Sheela-na-Gigs as Multiple Signifiers of the Female Body|date=2007|publisher=Cork University Press|location=Cork|pages=102–118}}&lt;/ref&gt; Irish writer Molly Mullin's essay ''Representations of History, Irish Feminism, and the Politics of Difference'' makes the point that the image of the Sheela na gig has almost become emblematic of Irish feminism as a force for hope and change.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Mullin|first1=Molly|title=Representations of History, Irish Feminism, and the Politics of Difference|journal=Feminist Studies|date=1991|volume=17|issue=1|page=29–50}}&lt;/ref&gt; Scholar Georgia Rhoades argues that for many contemporary feminists the gesture of the Sheela's unapologetic sexual display is "a message about her body, its power and significance—a gesture of rebellion against misogyny, rather than an endorsement of it".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Rhoades|first1=Georgia|title=Decoding the Sheela-na-gig|journal=Feminist Formations|date=2010|volume=22|issue=2|pages=167–194}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As noted above, Ireland has the greatest number of known sheela na gigs. At one time, they were mistakenly thought to be a uniquely Irish practice, however, scholars realized that the sheela na gig motif could be found all over western and central Europe.&lt;ref name=Andersen/&gt;&lt;ref name=Weir/&gt; Accurate numbers of figures are difficult to reach, as the interpretation of what is a sheela na gig will vary among scholars. For example, Freitag omits the Rochester figure from her list while Weir and Jerman include it. Concannon includes some worn figures that so far only she has identified as sheela na gigs.&lt;ref name=Concannon&gt;{{cite book |last=Concannon |first=Maureen |title=The Sacred Whore: Sheela Goddess of the Celts |publisher=The Collins Press |year=2004 |isbn=978-1903464526}}&lt;/ref&gt; With renewed interest in the topic, scholars have recently identified previously unknown figures, so more could be discovered.

==Parallels==
The ''Encyclopedia of Religion'',&lt;ref name=Eliade&gt;Eliade, Mercea ''The Encyclopedia of Religion'' 1993; MacMillan Reference Books&lt;/ref&gt; in its article on [[yoni]], notes the similarity between the positioning of many sheela na gigs above doorways or windows and the wooden female figures carved over the doorways of chiefs' houses (''bai'') in the [[Palau]]an archipelago. Called ''[[dilukai]]'' (or ''dilugai''), they are typically shown with legs splayed, revealing a large, black, triangular pubic area; the hands rest upon the thighs. The writers of the encyclopedia article say:
{{quote|These female figures protect the villagers' health and ward off all evil spirits as well. They are constructed by ritual specialists according to strict rules, which if broken would result in the specialist's as well as the chief's death. It is not coincidental that each example of signs representing the female genitalia used as apotropaic devices are found on gates. The vulva is the primordial gate, the mysterious divide between nonlife and life.}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2597">'''Soil crusts''' are [[soil]] surface layers that are distinct from the rest of the bulk soil, often hardened with a [[Ped#Platy|platy]] surface. Depending on the manner of formation, soil crusts can be biological or physical. Biological soil crusts are formed by communities of [[microorganisms]] that live on the soil surface whereas physical crusts are formed by physical impact such as that of raindrops.

==Biological soil crusts==
{{main|Biological soil crust}}
Biological soil crusts are communities of living organisms on the soil surface in arid- and semi-arid ecosystems. They are found throughout the world with varying species composition and cover depending on topography, soil characteristics, climate, plant community, microhabitats, and disturbance regimes. Biological soil crusts perform important ecological roles including carbon fixation, nitrogen fixation, soil stabilization, alter soil albedo and water relations, and affect germination and nutrient levels in vascular plants. They can be damaged by fire, recreational activity, grazing, and other disturbance and can require long time periods to recover composition and function. Biological soil crusts are also known as cryptogamic, microbiotic, microphytic, or cryptobiotic soils.

==Physical soil crusts==
Physical (as opposed to biological) soil crusts results from raindrop or trampling impacts. They are often hardened relative to uncrusted soil due to the accumulation of salts and silica. These can coexist with biological soil crusts, but have different ecological impact due to their difference in formation and composition. Physical soil crusts often reduce water infiltration, can inhibit plant establishment, and when disrupted can be eroded rapidly.&lt;ref&gt;Belnap, Jayne, et al. 2001.

'''Straw-bale construction''' is a [[Building construction|building]] method that uses [[straw bale|bales of straw]] (commonly wheat, rice, rye and oats straw) as structural elements, [[building insulation]], or both. This construction method is commonly used in [[natural building]] or "brown" construction projects. Research has shown that straw-bale construction is a sustainable method for building, from the standpoint of both materials and energy needed for heating and cooling.&lt;ref&gt;Milutiene, Edita, et al. "increase in Buildings Sustainability Using Renewable materials and Energy." Clean Technologies &amp; Environmental policy 14.6 (2012): 1075-84.Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

Advantages of straw-bale construction over conventional building systems include the renewable nature of straw, cost, easy availability, naturally fire-retardant and high insulation value.&lt;ref&gt;Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation.

==History==
Straw houses have been built on the African plains since the [[Paleolithic]] Era. Straw bales were used in construction 400 years ago in Germany; and straw-thatched roofs have long been used in northern Europe and Asia. When European Settlers came to North America, [[Tipi|teepees]] were insulated in winter with loose straw between the inner lining and outer cover.&lt;ref name=viable&gt;Marks, Leanne R.  (2005).

Straw-bale construction was greatly facilitated by the mechanical hay baler, which was invented in the 1850s and was widespread by the 1890s.&lt;ref name=viable /&gt;  It proved particularly useful in the [[Sand Hills (Nebraska)|Nebraska Sandhills]]. Pioneers seeking land under the 1862 [[Homestead Act]] and the 1904 [[Kinkaid Act]] found a dearth of trees over much of Nebraska. In many parts of the state, the soil was suitable for [[Dugout (shelter)|dugouts]] and [[sod house]]s.&lt;ref name=custersurvey&gt;[http://www.nebraskahistory.org/histpres/reports/custer_county.pdf Nebraska Historic Buildings Survey: Custer County]  [http://www.nebraskahistory.org/index.htm Nebraska State Historical Society.]  Retrieved 2010-08-29.&lt;/ref&gt;
However, in the Sandhills, the soil generally made poor construction sod;&lt;ref name=nomform&gt;Spencer, Janet Jeffries and D. Murphy (1979).

in the few places where suitable sod could be found, it was more valuable for agriculture than as a building material.&lt;ref name=laststraw&gt;Hammett, Jerilou and Kingsley (1998).

Retrieved 2010-08-10.&lt;/ref&gt;

The first documented use of hay bales in construction in Nebraska was a schoolhouse built in 1896 or 1897. Unfenced and unprotected by stucco or plaster, it was reported in 1902 as having been eaten by cows. To combat this, builders began plastering their bale structures; if cement or lime stucco was unavailable, locally obtained "gumbo mud" was employed.&lt;ref name=laststraw /&gt; Between 1896 and 1945, an estimated 70 straw-bale buildings, including houses, farm buildings, churches, schools, offices, and grocery stores had been built in the Sandhills.&lt;ref name=viable /&gt;  In 1990, nine surviving bale buildings were reported in [[Arthur County, Nebraska|Arthur]] and [[Logan County, Nebraska|Logan]] Counties,&lt;ref name=arthursurvey&gt;Kay, John, David Anthone, Robert Kay, and Christina Hugly (1990).

including the 1928 [[Pilgrim Holiness Church (Arthur, Nebraska)|Pilgrim Holiness Church]] in the village of [[Arthur, Nebraska|Arthur]], which is listed in the [[National Register of Historic Places]].&lt;ref name=nomform /&gt;

Since the 1990s straw-bale construction has been substantially revived, particularly in North America, Europe, and Australia.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | last=Hollis | first=Murray | year=2005 | title=Practical Straw Bale Building | publisher=Landlinks Press | location=Collingwood | isbn=0-643-06977-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; This revival is likely attributed to greater environmental awareness and the material's natural, non-toxic qualities, low [[embodied energy]], and relative affordability.  Straw-bale construction has encountered issues regarding building codes depending on the location of the building.&lt;ref&gt;Kathryn Henderson

However, in the USA, the introduction of Appendices S and R in the 2015 International Residential Code has helped to legitimize and improve understanding of straw-bale construction. In France, the approval in 2012 of professional rules for straw-building recognized it as “common technology” et qualifies for standard-insurance programs&lt;ref&gt;http://rfcp.fr/les-regles-professionnelles/&lt;/ref&gt;.

==Method==

Straw bale building typically consists of stacking rows of bales (often in [[Stretcher bond|running-bond]]) on a raised footing or [[Foundation (architecture)|foundation]], with a moisture barrier or capillary break between the bales and their supporting platform.&lt;ref name="Jones"&gt;{{cite book|last=Jones|first=Barbara|title=Building with Straw Bales: A Practical Guide for UK and Ireland|publisher=Green Books|location=Dartington, Totnes, Devon TQ9 6EB|year=2002|edition=2011|page=26|isbn=978-1-900322-51-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are two types of straw-bales commonly used, those bound together with two strings and those with three.  The three string bale is the larger in all three dimensions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Keefe |first=Chris |title=Straw Bale Design - Choosing the Right Size Straw Bales |url=http://www.strawbale.com/straw-bale-design-choosing-your-bales/ |publisher=Strawbale.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bale walls can be tied together with pins of [[bamboo]] or [[wood]] (internal to the bales or on their faces), or with surface wire meshes, and then [[stucco]]ed or [[plaster]]ed, either with a lime-based formulation or earth/clay render. The bales may actually provide the structural support for the building&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Malin |first=Nadav |title=Building With Straw Bale |publisher=.buildinggreen.com |date=1 May 1993 |accessdate=5 October 2013 |url=http://www.buildinggreen.com/auth/article.cfm/1993/5/1/Building-with-Straw-Bales/}}&lt;/ref&gt; ("[[load-bearing wall|load-bearing]]" or "Nebraska-style" technique), as was the case in the original examples from the late 19th century. The plastered bale assembly also can be designed to provide [[Lateral consonant|lateral]] and shear [[Support (structure)|support]] for wind and seismic loads.

[[File:Lehmverputztes Strohballenhaus.jpg|thumb|left|This straw bale house plastered with [[loam]] [[earthen plaster]] is located in [[Swalmen]], in the southeastern [[Netherlands]]]]
Alternatively, bale buildings can have a structural frame of other materials, usually lumber or timber-frame, with bales simply serving as insulation and plaster substrate, ("infill" or "non-loadbearing" technique), which is most often required in northern regions and/or in wet climates. In northern regions, the potential snow-loading can exceed the strength of the bale walls. In wet climates, the imperative for applying a vapor-permeable finish precludes the use of cement-based stucco. Additionally, the inclusion of a skeletal framework of wood or metal allows the erection of a roof prior to raising the bales, which can protect the bale wall during construction, when it is the most vulnerable to water damage in all but the most dependably arid climates. A combination of [[Framing (construction)|framing]] and load-bearing techniques may also be employed, referred to as "hybrid" straw bale construction.&lt;ref name=MacDonald&gt;{{cite book |last= Myhrman |first= Matts |author2=S.O. MacDonald  |title= Build it with Bales |publisher= Out on Bale |year= 1994 |isbn= 0-9642821-1-9 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Straw bale house03.jpg|thumb|right|Straw bale construction]]
Straw bales can also be used as part of a [[Spar and Membrane Structure]] (SMS) wall system in which lightly reinforced 5&amp;nbsp;- 8&amp;nbsp;cm (2 - 3") [[gunite]] or [[shotcrete]] skins are interconnected with extended "X" shaped light rebar in the head joints of the bales.&lt;ref&gt;Black, Gary, and Mannik, Henri, "Spar and Membrane Structure" The Last Straw journal, #17, Winter 1997&lt;/ref&gt; In this wall system the concrete skins provide structure, seismic reinforcing, and fireproofing, while the bales are used as leave-in [[formwork]] and insulation.

The [[University of Bath]] has completed a research programme which used ‘ModCell’ panels - pre-fabricated panels consisting of a wooden structural frame infilled with straw bales and rendered with a breathable lime-based system - to build 'BaleHaus', a straw bale construction on the university's campus. Monitoring work of the structure carried out by architectural researchers at the university has found that as well as reducing the environmental footprint, the construction offers other benefits, including healthier living through higher levels of thermal insulation and regulation of humidity levels. The group has published a number of research papers on its findings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=BaleHaus: innovation in straw bale building|url=http://www.bath.ac.uk/research/case-studies/balehaus-innovative-straw-bale-building|work=The University of Bath|accessdate=8 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Typically "field bales" (bales created on farms with baling machines) have been used, but recently higher-density "precompressed" bales (or "straw-blocks") are increasing the loads that may be supported. Oryzatech out of Goleta, California has been developing rice straw compressed block.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Wilson |first=Alex |title=Lego Blocks from Straw |publisher=Buildinggreen.com |date=1 December 2009 |url=http://www.buildinggreen.com/auth/article.cfm/2009/12/1/Lego-Blocks-from-Straw/}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Field bales might support around 900&amp;nbsp;kg per linear meter of wall (600&amp;nbsp;lb./ lin. ft.), but the high density bales bear up to 6000&amp;nbsp;kg per linear meter of wall (4,000&amp;nbsp;lb./lin.ft.), and more. The basic bale-building method is now increasingly being extended to bound modules of other oft-recycled materials, including tire-bales, cardboard, paper, plastic, and used carpeting. The technique has also been extended to bags containing "bales" of wood chips or [[rice-hull bagwall construction|rice hulls]].&lt;ref name=Steen /&gt;&lt;ref name=Magwood /&gt;

Straw bales have also been used in very energy efficient high performance buildings such as the S-House&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Hans-Peter Petek |url=http://www.s-house.at/presentations.htm |title=S-House |publisher=S-house.at |accessdate=2014-04-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; in Austria which meets the Passivhaus energy standard. In South Africa, a five-star lodge made from 10,000 strawbales has housed luminaries such as Nelson Mandela and Tony Blair.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://inhabitat.com/five-star-didimala-lodge-is-the-world%E2%80%99s-largest-strawbale-building/ |title=Five Star Didimala Lodge Is The World’s Largest Strawbale Building! |publisher=Inhabitat |accessdate=2014-04-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the Swiss Alps, in the little village of [[Nax|Nax Mont-Noble]], construction works have begun in October 2011 for the first hotel in Europe built entirely with straw bales.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mayaguesthouse.wordpress.com/ |title=Blog about the first hotel built with straw bales |publisher=Mayaguesthouse.wordpress.com |accessdate=2014-04-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Harrison Vault,&lt;ref&gt;[http://skillful-means.com/pages/details.php?pid=14&amp;photonumber=1&amp;showphoto=vault01.jpg ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110621161559/http://skillful-means.com/pages/details.php?pid=14&amp;photonumber=1&amp;showphoto=vault01.jpg |date=June 21, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; in Joshua Tree, California, is engineered to withstand the high seismic loads in that area using only the assembly consisting of bales, lath and plaster.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://docs.google.com/a/tippingmar.com/viewer?a=v&amp;pid=sites&amp;srcid=dGlwcGluZ21hci5jb218dG0tcHVibGljLWRvY3VtZW50c3xneDo1OTU1YWQ2NWU1ODRjNDRj |title=Google Drive Viewer |publisher=Docs.google.com |accessdate=2014-04-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; The technique was used successfully for strawbale housing in rural China.&lt;ref name="google1"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://docs.google.com/a/tippingmar.com/viewer?a=v&amp;pid=sites&amp;srcid=dGlwcGluZ21hci5jb218dG0tcHVibGljLWRvY3VtZW50c3xneDozMTcyM2VlMTdlZDQ1MTQ |title=Google Drive Viewer |publisher=Docs.google.com |accessdate=2014-04-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; Straw bale domes along the Syrio-African rift at Kibbutz Lotan have an interior geodesic frame of steel pipes.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kibbutzlotan.com/#!creative-ecology-eco-campus/cg14 EcoCampus, Center for Creative Ecology, Kibbutz Lotan]&lt;/ref&gt; 
Another method to reap the benefits of straw is to incorporate straw-bale walls into a pre-existing structure.&lt;ref&gt;Whitty, Cadmon.

==Thermal Properties==
Compressed straw bales have a wide range of documented R-value. R-value is a measurement of a materials insulating quality, higher the number the more insulating.  The reported R-value ranges from 17-55 (in American units) or 3-9.6 (in SI) depending on the study, differing wall designs could be responsible for wide range in R-value.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.buildinggreen.com/auth/article.cfm/1998/9/1/R-Value-of-Straw-Bales-Lower-Than-Previously-Reported/ |title=R-Value of Straw Bales Lower Than Previously Reported - EBN: 7:9 |publisher=Buildinggreen.com |accessdate=2014-04-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://aceee.org/proceedings-paper/ss98/panel01/paper04 ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110710075736/http://aceee.org/proceedings-paper/ss98/panel01/paper04 |date=July 10, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Bale walls are typically coated with a thick layer of plaster, which provides a well-distributed [[thermal mass]], active on a short-term (diurnal) cycle. The combination of insulation and mass provide an excellent platform for [[passive solar building design]] for winter and summer.

Compressed and plastered straw bale walls are also resistant to fire.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ecobuildnetwork.org/fire-test-video |title=Straw Bale Fire Test Video - Ecological Building Network |publisher=Ecobuildnetwork.org |accessdate=2014-04-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Problems with straw-bale==
Two significant problems related to straw-bale construction are moisture and [[mold]]. During the construction phase, buildings need to be protected from rain and from water leakages into the body of the walls.&lt;ref&gt;http://thesustainablehome.net/do-straw-bale-buildings-last/&lt;/ref&gt; If exposed to water, compressed straw may expand due to absorption of moisture. In turn, this can cause more cracking through which more moisture can infiltrate. Further damage to the wall can be caused by mold releasing potentially toxic spores into the wall cavities&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |pmc=145304|year=2003|author1=Kuhn|first1=D. M.|title=Indoor Mold, Toxigenic Fungi, and Stachybotrys chartarum: Infectious Disease Perspective|journal=Clinical Microbiology Reviews|volume=16|issue=1|pages=144–172|last2=Ghannoum|first2=M. A.|doi=10.1128/CMR.16.1.144-172.2003|pmid=12525430}}&lt;/ref&gt; and into the air.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.nachi.org/strawbalehomebasics2006.htm&lt;/ref&gt; In hot climates, where walls may have become internally dampened, internal temperatures may rise (due to decomposition of affected straw). While fire is generally considered a rare event, compressed straw or hay bales have the serious potential of undergoing spontaneous internal combustion.&lt;ref&gt;http://agriculture.vic.gov.au/agriculture/dairy/pastures-management/haystack-fires-spontaneous-combustion Vermin&lt;/ref&gt; Rats and mice can infiltrate straw bale homes during construction, so care must be taken to keep such animals out of the material. Other problems relate to straw dust which may cause breathing difficulties among people with allergies to straw or hay.&lt;ref&gt;http://envibuild.eu/archive/2014/proceedings2014/enviBUILD-2014-proceedings.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://emedicine.medscape.com/article/298811-overview&lt;/ref&gt;

Several companies have developed prefabricated strawbale walls. A passive ecological house can easily be assembled with those panels.

In [[law]] and [[ethics]], '''universal law''' or '''universal principle''' refers as concepts of legal [[Legitimacy (political)|legitimacy]] actions, whereby those [[Value (personal and cultural)|principles]] and rules for governing human beings' conduct which are most universal in their acceptability, their applicability, translation, and [[philosophical]] basis, are therefore considered to be most legitimate.  One type of Universal Law is the Law of Logic which prohibits logical contradictions known as sophistry.  The Law of Logic is based upon the universal idea that logic is defined as that which is not illogical and that which is illogical is that which involves a logical contradiction, such as attempting to assert that an apple and no apple can exist at and in the same time and in the same place, and attempting to assert that A and not A can exist at and in the same time and in the same place. What goes around , comes around.

The '''Vegetable Production System''' ('''Veggie''') is a plant growth system developed and used by [[NASA]] in outer space environments. The purpose of Veggie is to provide a self-sufficient and sustainable food source for astronauts as well as a means of recreation and relaxation through therapeutic gardening.&lt;ref name=Massa&gt;{{cite conference |url=https://ntrs.nasa.gov/archive/nasa/casi.ntrs.nasa.gov/20160006558.pdf |title=Growth Chambers on the International Space Station for Large Plants |conference=8th International Symposium on Light in Horticulture. 22–26 May 2016.

== Overview ==
[[File:Learning About 'Veggie' at the NASA Social.jpg|thumb|Vegetable Production System for ISS being discussed]]
[[File:ISS-46 Zinnia flowers in the Veggie facility (2).jpg|thumb|Zinnia flowers in Veggie]]
Veggie is part of an overarching project concerning research of growing crops in zero gravity. Among the goals of this project are to learn about how plants grow in a weightless environment and to learn about how plants can efficiently be grown for crew use in space.&lt;ref name=Massa /&gt; Veggie was designed to be low-maintenance, using low power and having a low launch mass. Thus, Veggie provides a minorly regulated environment with minimal control over the atmosphere and temperature of the module. The successor to the Veggie project is the Advanced Plant Habitat (APH), components of which will be delivered to the [[International Space Station]] during the [[Cygnus CRS OA-7]] and [[SpaceX CRS-11]] missions in 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.nasa.gov/feature/new-plant-habitat-will-increase-harvest-on-international-space-station |title=New Plant Habitat Will Increase Harvest on International Space Station |publisher=NASA |first=Linda |last=Herridge |date=2 March 2017 |accessdate=15 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Design ==

A Veggie module weighs less than {{convert|8|kg|lb|abbr=on}} and uses 90&amp;nbsp;watts.&lt;ref name=data_sheet&gt;{{cite web |url=https://techport.nasa.gov/view/10498 |title=Vegetable Production System (Veggie) Project |series=TechPort |publisher=NASA |accessdate=4 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; It consists of three parts: a lighting system, a bellows enclosure, and a reservoir.&lt;ref name=Zabel&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://sciences.ucf.edu/class/wp-content/uploads/sites/58/2017/02/Zabel_Review_Analysis_40yr_Space_Plant_Growth_Systems_LifeSciencesSpaceR....pdf |title=Review and analysis of over 40 years of space plant growth systems |journal=LIfe Sciences in Space Research |first1=P. |last1=Zabel |first2=M. |last2=Bamsey |first3=D. |last3=Schubert |first4=M. |last4=Tajmar |volume=10 |pages=1–16 |date=August 2016 |doi=10.1016/j.lssr.2016.06.004 |bibcode=2016LSSR...10....1Z}}&lt;/ref&gt; The lighting system regulates the amount and intensity of light plants receive, the bellows enclosure keeps the environment inside the unit separate from its surroundings, and the reservoir connects to plant pillows where the seeds grow.

=== Lighting system ===

Veggie's lighting system consists of three different types of colored [[Light-emitting diode|LEDs]]: red, blue, and green. Each color corresponds to a different light intensity that the plants will receive.&lt;ref name=Massa /&gt; Although the lighting system can be reconfigured, the following table shows the default settings and their corresponding intensities in micromoles per second per square meter.&lt;ref name=Massa /&gt;

{| class="wikitable"
|-
! Setting !! Red !! Blue !! Green
|-
| Low || {{val|120|10}}%|| {{val|30|10}}% || -

| High || {{val|360|10}}% || {{val|90|10}}% || -
|-
| On || - || - || {{val|30|5}}%
|-
| Potential || 550 || 150 || 100
|}

In addition to this lighting system, Veggie also uses opaque bellows to obstruct external sources of light.&lt;ref name=Massa /&gt;

=== Bellows enclosure ===

The bellows enclosure controls the flow and pressure of air within the container. The bellows are made from a [[fluoropolymer|fluorinated polymer]] and connected to the lighting system at its top and a baseplate at its bottom. Power and cooling is provided to the hardware that powers the bellows by [[ExPRESS Rack]]s.&lt;ref name=Massa /&gt;  Although the bellows regulate air flow and air pressure, temperature and humidity are left controlled by the surrounding environment of the Veggie module.&lt;ref name=Zabel/&gt;

=== Reservoir ===

The reservoir of the Veggie module contains and provides water to the [[plant pillow]]s in which plants grow. The plant pillows contain all other material such as fertilizer and seeds for the plant to grow. Seeds are oriented inside the sticky plant pillow so that their roots will grow downwards into the substrate provided by the plant pillow and that their stems will grow upwards outside of the plant pillow.&lt;ref name=video&gt;{{cite AV media |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y9aR2-7sOjg |title=ScienceCasts: Historic Vegetable Moment on the Space Station |series=Science@NASA |publisher=NASA |work=YouTube.com |date=20 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An ancient statue of Venus, for example, stood in a different traditional context with the Greeks, who made it an object of veneration, than with the clerics of the Middle Ages, who viewed it as an ominous idol. Both of them, however, were equally confronted with its uniqueness, that is, its aura." [''Die Einzigkeit des Kunstwerks ist identisch mit seinem Eingebettetsein in den Zusammenhang der Tradition. Diese Tradition selber ist freilich etwas durchaus Lebendiges, etwas außerordentlich Wandelbares. Eine antike Venusstatue z.

An eclectic thinker, combining elements of [[German idealism]], [[Romanticism]], [[Western Marxism]], and [[Jewish mysticism]], Benjamin made enduring and influential contributions to [[Aesthetics|aesthetic theory]], [[literary criticism]], and [[historical materialism]]. He was associated with the [[Frankfurt School]], and also maintained formative friendships with thinkers such as [[playwright]] [[Bertolt Brecht]] and [[Kabbalah]] scholar [[Gershom Scholem]]. He was also related by law to [[Germans|German]] [[political theory|political theorist]] and philosopher [[Hannah Arendt]] through her first marriage to Benjamin's cousin, [[Günther Anders]].

Among Benjamin's best known works are the essays "The Task of the Translator" (1923), "[[The Work of Art in the Age of Mechanical Reproduction]]" (1936), and "[[Theses on the Philosophy of History]]" (1940). His major work as a literary critic included essays on [[Charles Baudelaire|Baudelaire]], [[Johann Wolfgang von Goethe|Goethe]], [[Franz Kafka|Kafka]], [[Karl Kraus (writer)|Kraus]], [[Nikolai Leskov|Leskov]], [[Marcel Proust|Proust]], [[Robert Walser (writer)|Walser]], and [[translation theory]]. He also made major translations into German of the ''Tableaux Parisiens'' section of Baudelaire's ''[[Les Fleurs du mal]]'' and parts of Proust's ''[[In Search of Lost Time|À la recherche du temps perdu]]''. In 1940, at the age of 48, Benjamin committed suicide at [[Portbou]] on the French–Spanish border while attempting to escape from invading [[Nazism|Nazi forces]]. Though popular acclaim eluded him during his life, the decades following his death won his work posthumous renown.

== Life ==
{{Frankfurt School}}

=== Early life and education ===
Benjamin and his younger siblings, Georg (1895–1942) and Dora (1901–1946), were born to a wealthy business family of assimilated [[Ashkenazi Jews]] in the Berlin of the [[German Empire]] (1871–1918). The patriarch of Walter Benjamin's family, Emil Benjamin, was a banker in Paris who relocated from France to Germany, where he worked as an antiques trader in Berlin; he later married Pauline Schönflies. He owned a number of investments in Berlin, including ice skating rinks. Benjamin's uncle [[William Stern (psychologist)|William Stern]] (born Wilhelm Louis Stern; 1871-1938) was a prominent German [[child psychology|child psychologist]] who developed the concept of the [[intelligence quotient]] (IQ), and Benjamin's cousin [[Günther Anders]] (born Günther Siegmund Stern; 1902-1992) was a German philosopher and anti-nuclear activist who studied under [[Edmund Husserl]] and [[Martin Heidegger]]. Through his mother, his great-uncle was the classical archaeologist [[Gustav Hirschfeld]].&lt;ref&gt;Howard Eiland, ''Walter Benjamin: A Critical Life'', Harvard University Press (2014), p. 20&lt;/ref&gt; In 1902, ten-year-old Walter was enrolled to the Kaiser Friedrich School in [[Charlottenburg]]; he completed his secondary school studies ten years later. Walter Benjamin was a boy of fragile health and so in 1905 the family sent him to Hermann-Lietz-Schule Haubinda, a [[boarding school]] in the [[Thuringia]]n countryside, for two years; in 1907, having returned to Berlin, he resumed his schooling at the Kaiser Friedrich School.&lt;ref name="Witte" /&gt;

In 1912, at the age of twenty, he enrolled at the [[University of Freiburg]], but, at summer semester's end, returned to Berlin, then matriculated into the [[Humboldt University of Berlin|University of Berlin]], to continue studying philosophy. Here Benjamin had his first exposure to the ideas of [[Zionism]], which had not been part of his liberal upbringing. This exposure gave him occasion to formulate his own ideas about the meaning of Judaism. Benjamin distanced himself from political and nationalist Zionism, instead developing in his own thinking what he called a kind of "cultural Zionism"—an attitude which recognized and promoted Judaism and Jewish values. In Benjamin's formulation his Jewishness meant a commitment to the furtherance of European culture. Benjamin expressed "My life experience led me to this insight: the Jews represent an elite in the ranks of the spiritually active ... For Judaism is to me in no sense an end in itself, but the most distinguished bearer and representative of the spiritual." This was a position that Benjamin largely held lifelong.&lt;ref&gt;Witte, Bernd. (1996) ''Walter Benjamin: An Intellectual Biography''. New York: Verso. pp. 26–27&lt;/ref&gt;

Elected president of the ''Freie Studentenschaft'' (Free Students Association), Benjamin wrote essays arguing for educational and general cultural change.&lt;ref&gt;'' Experience'', 1913&lt;/ref&gt; When not re-elected as student association president, he returned to Freiburg University to study, with particular attention to the lectures of [[Heinrich Rickert]]; at that time he travelled to France and Italy.

In 1914, at the outbreak of the First World War (1914–1918), Benjamin began faithfully translating the works of the 19th-century French poet [[Charles Baudelaire]] (1821–1867). The next year, 1915, he moved to Munich, and continued his schooling at the [[University of Munich]], where he met [[Rainer Maria Rilke]] and [[Gershom Scholem]]; the latter became a friend. In that year, Benjamin wrote about the 18th-century [[Romanticism|Romantic]] German poet [[Friedrich Hölderlin]] (1770–1843).

In 1917 he transferred to the [[University of Bern]]; there, he met [[Ernst Bloch]], and Dora Sophie Pollak (née Kellner) (1890–1964) whom he later married. They had a son, Stefan Rafael (1918–1972). In 1919 Benjamin earned his [[Ph.D.]] ''[[cum laude]]'' with the dissertation ''Begriff der Kunstkritik in der Deutschen Romantik'' (''The Concept of Art Criticism in German Romanticism''). Later, unable to support himself and family, he returned to Berlin and resided with his parents. In 1921 he published the essay ''Kritik der Gewalt'' (The Critique of Violence). At this time Benjamin first became socially acquainted with [[Leo Strauss]], and Benjamin would remain an admirer of Strauss and of his work throughout his life.&lt;ref&gt;''Jewish philosophy and the crisis of modernity'' (SUNY 1997), ''Leo Strauss as a Modern Jewish thinker'', Kenneth Hart Green, Leo Strauss, page 55&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Scholem, Gershom. 1981. Walter Benjamin: The Story of a Friendship. Trans. Harry Zohn, page 201&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''The Correspondence of Walter Benjamin and Gershom Scholem, 1932–40'', New York 1989, page 155-58&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Career ===
In 1923, when the ''[[Institute for Social Research|Institut für Sozialforschung]]'' (Institute for Social Research) was founded, later to become home to the [[Frankfurt School]], Benjamin published ''Charles Baudelaire, Tableaux Parisiens''. At that time he became acquainted with [[Theodor Adorno]] and befriended [[Georg Lukács]], whose ''The Theory of the Novel'' (1920) much influenced him. Meanwhile, the [[inflation in the Weimar Republic]] consequent to the First World War made it difficult for the father Emil Benjamin to continue supporting his son's family. At the end of 1923 his best friend Gershom Scholem immigrated to Palestine, a country under the [[Mandatory Palestine|British Mandate of Palestine]]; despite repeated invitations, he failed to persuade Benjamin (and family) to leave the Continent for the Middle East.

In 1924 [[Hugo von Hofmannsthal]], in the ''Neue Deutsche Beiträge'' magazine, published ''Goethes Wahlverwandtschaften'' (''[[Elective Affinities]]''), by Walter Benjamin, about Goethe's third novel, ''[[Elective Affinities|Die Wahlverwandtschaften]]'' (1809). Later that year Benjamin and Ernst Bloch resided on the Italian island of [[Capri]]; Benjamin wrote ''Ursprung des deutschen Trauerspiels'' (''The Origin of German Tragic Drama''), as a [[habilitation]] dissertation meant to qualify him as a tenured university professor in Germany. He also read, at Bloch's suggestion, ''[[History and Class Consciousness]]'' (1923) by Georg Lukács. He also met the Latvian Bolshevik and actress [[Asja Lācis]], then residing in Moscow; she became his lover and was a lasting intellectual influence upon him.

A year later, in 1925, Benjamin withdrew ''The Origin of German Tragic Drama'' as his possible qualification for the habilitation teaching credential at the [[Johann Wolfgang Goethe University Frankfurt am Main|University of Frankfurt]] at Frankfurt am Main, fearing its possible rejection;&lt;ref name="BL"&gt;Jane O. Newman, ''Benjamin's Library: Modernity, Nation, and the Baroque'', Cornell University Press, 2011, p. 28: "...university officials in Frankfurt recommended that Benjamin withdraw the work from consideration as his Habilitation."&lt;/ref&gt; he was not to be an academic instructor. Working with [[Franz Hessel]] (1880–1941) he translated the first volumes of ''À la Recherche du Temps Perdu'' (In Search of Lost Time) by [[Marcel Proust]]. The next year, 1926, he began writing for the German newspapers ''[[Frankfurter Zeitung]]'' (The Frankfurt Times) and ''Die Literarische Welt'' (The Literary World); that paid enough for him to reside in Paris for some months. In December 1926 (the year his father, Emil Benjamin, died) Walter Benjamin went to Moscow to meet Asja Lācis and found her ill in a sanatorium.&lt;ref&gt;''Moscow Diary''&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1927, he began ''[[The Arcades Project|Das Passagen-Werk]]'' (The Arcades Project), his uncompleted ''[[Masterpiece|magnum opus]]'', a study of 19th-century Parisian life. The same year, he saw Gershom Scholem in Berlin, for the last time, and considered emigrating from Continental Europe (Germany) to Palestine. In 1928, he and Dora separated (they divorced two years later, in 1930); in the same year he published ''Einbahnstraße'' (One-Way Street), and a revision of his habilitation dissertation ''Ursprung des Deutschen Trauerspiels'' (''The Origin of German Tragic Drama''). In 1929 Berlin, Asja Lācis, then assistant to [[Bertolt Brecht]], socially presented the intellectuals to each other. In that time, he also briefly embarked upon an academic career, as an instructor at the [[University of Heidelberg]].

=== Exile and death ===
[[File:BenjaminBnF.jpg|alt= Walter Benjamin's membership card for the Bibliothèque nationale de France (1940).|thumb|257x257px|Walter Benjamin's membership card for the [[Bibliothèque nationale de France]] (1940).]]
In 1932, during the turmoil preceding [[Adolf Hitler]]'s assumption of the office of Chancellor of Germany, Walter Benjamin left Germany for the Spanish island of [[Ibiza]] for some months; he then moved to [[Nice]], where he considered killing himself. Perceiving the socio-political and cultural significance of the [[Reichstag fire]] (27 February 1933) as the ''de facto'' Nazi assumption of full power in Germany, then manifest with the subsequent [[Racial policy of Nazi Germany|persecution of the Jews]], he moved to Paris, but, before doing so, he sought shelter in [[Svendborg]], at Bertolt Brecht's house, and at [[Sanremo]], where his ex-wife Dora lived.

As he ran out of money, Benjamin collaborated with [[Max Horkheimer]], and received funds from the Institute for Social Research, later going permanently into exile. In Paris, he met other German artists and intellectuals, refugees there from Germany; he befriended [[Hannah Arendt]], novelist [[Hermann Hesse]], and composer [[Kurt Weill]]. In 1936, a first version of ''[[The Work of Art in the Age of Mechanical Reproduction]]'' (''L'œuvre d'art à l'époque de sa reproduction méchanisée'') was published, in French, by Max Horkheimer in the ''Zeitschrift für Sozialforschung'' journal of the [[Institute for Social Research]]. It was a critique of the authenticity of mass-produced art; he wrote that a mechanically produced copy of an artwork can be taken somewhere where the original could never have gone, arguing that the presence of the original is "prerequisite to the concept of authenticity".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Benjamin|first=Walter|date=1968|chapter=The Work Of Art In The Age Of Mechanical Reproduction|url=|title=Illuminations: Essays and Reflections|pages=217–253|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;[[File:Benjamin's apartment in Paris (fot. Mateusz Palka).jpg|thumb|342x342px|Walter Benjamin's Paris apartment at 10 [[:fr:Rue Dombasle|rue Dombasle]] (1938–1940)]]In 1937 Benjamin worked on ''Das Paris des Second Empire bei Baudelaire'' (The Paris of the Second Empire in Baudelaire), met [[Georges Bataille]] (to whom he later entrusted the ''Arcades Project'' manuscript), and joined the [[College of Sociology]]. In 1938 he paid a last visit to Bertolt Brecht, who was exiled to Denmark. Meanwhile, the [[Nazi Germany|Nazi Régime]] stripped German Jews of their German citizenship; now a stateless man, Benjamin was arrested by the French government and incarcerated for three months in a prison camp near [[Nevers]], in central [[Burgundy (French region)|Burgundy]].

Returning to Paris in January 1940, he wrote ''Über den Begriff der Geschichte'' (''On the Concept of History'', later published as ''[[Theses on the Philosophy of History]]''). While the [[Wehrmacht]] was pushing back the [[French Army]], on 13 June Benjamin and his sister fled Paris to the town of [[Lourdes]], just a day before the Germans entered the capital with orders to arrest him at his flat. In August, he obtained a travel visa to the US that Max Horkheimer had negotiated for him. In eluding the [[Gestapo]], Benjamin planned to travel to the US from neutral Portugal, which he expected to reach via [[Francoist Spain]], then ostensibly a neutral country.

[[File:Grab Walter Benjamin.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Walter Benjamin's grave in Portbou. The epitaph in German, repeated in Catalan, quotes from Section 7 of ''Theses on the Philosophy of History'': "There is no document of culture which is not at the same time a document of barbarism"]]The historical record indicates that he safely crossed the French–Spanish border and arrived at the coastal town of [[Portbou]], in [[Catalonia]]. The Franco government had cancelled all transit visas and ordered the Spanish police to return such persons to France, including the Jewish refugee group Benjamin had joined. They tried to cross the border on 25 September 1940, but were told by the Spanish police that they would be deported back to France the next day, which would have destroyed Benjamin's plans to travel to the United States. Expecting repatriation to Nazi hands, Walter Benjamin killed himself with an overdose of morphine tablets that night, while staying in the ''Hotel de Francia''; the official Portbou register records 26 September 1940 as the official date of death.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Arendt|editor=Walter Benjamin|first=Hannah|date=1968|chapter=Introduction|url=|title=Illuminations: Essays and Reflections|pages=23–24|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Witte"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Jay, Martin ''The Dialectical Imagination: A History of the Frankfurt School and the Institute of Social Research 1923–1950''.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Leslie|first=Esther|title=Walter Benjamin: Overpowering Conformism|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=FXUN34lH-jgC&amp;pg=PA215|accessdate=August 28, 2009|series=Modern European Thinkers|year=2000|publisher=Pluto Press|isbn=978-0-7453-1568-3|page=215|chapter=Benjamin's Finale}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Lester|first=David|title=Suicide and the Holocaust|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=R1nkj-xSzYgC&amp;pg=PA74|accessdate=August 28, 2009|year=2005|publisher=Nova Publishers|isbn=978-1-59454-427-9|page=74|chapter=Suicide to Escape Capture: Cases}}&lt;/ref&gt; Benjamin's colleague [[Arthur Koestler]], also fleeing Europe, attempted suicide by taking some of the morphine tablets, but he survived.&lt;ref&gt;"Afraid of being caught by the Gestapo while fleeing France, [Koestler] borrowed suicide pills from Walter Benjamin. He took them several weeks later when it seemed he would be unable to get out of Lisbon, but didn't die."

Despite his suicide, Benjamin was buried in the [[consecration|consecrated]] section of a Roman Catholic cemetery.

The others in his party were allowed passage the next day (maybe because Benjamin's suicide shocked Spanish officials), and safely reached [[Lisbon]] on 30 September. [[Hannah Arendt]], who crossed the French-Spanish border at Portbou a few months later, passed the manuscript of ''Theses'' to [[Theodor W. Adorno|Adorno]]. Another completed manuscript, which Benjamin had carried in his suitcase, disappeared after his death and has not been recovered. Some critics speculate that it was his ''Arcades Project'' in a final form; this is very unlikely as the author's plans for the work had changed in the wake of Adorno's criticisms in 1938, and it seems clear that the work was flowing over its containing limits in his last years.

== Thought ==
[[File:Klee, Angelus novus.png|thumb|right|293x293px|[[Paul Klee]]'s 1920 painting ''[[Angelus Novus]]'', which Benjamin compared to "the angel of history"]]
Walter Benjamin corresponded much with [[Theodor Adorno]] and [[Bertolt Brecht]], and was occasionally funded by the [[Frankfurt School]] under the direction of Adorno and [[Horkheimer]], even from their New York City residence. The competing influences—Brecht's Marxism, Adorno's [[critical theory]], Gerschom Scholem's Jewish mysticism—were central to his work, although their philosophic differences remained unresolved. Moreover, the critic [[Paul de Man]] argued that the intellectual range of Benjamin's writings flows dynamically among those three intellectual traditions, deriving a critique via juxtaposition; the exemplary synthesis is ''Theses on the Philosophy of History''. At least one scholar, [[religious studies|historian of religion]] Jason Josephson-Storm, has argued that Benjamin's diverse interests may be understood in part by understanding the influence of [[Western Esotericism]] on Benjamin. Some of Benjamin's key ideas were adapted from occultists and [[New Age movement|New Age]] figures including [[Eric Gutkind]] and [[Ludwig Klages]], and his interest in esotericism is known to have extended far beyond the Jewish [[Kabbalah]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | last = Josephson-Storm | first = Jason | title = The Myth of Disenchantment: Magic, Modernity, and the Birth of the Human Sciences | location = Chicago | publisher = University of Chicago Press | date = 2017 |pages = 226–36 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=xZ5yDgAAQBAJ | isbn = 0-226-40336-X }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== ''Theses on the Philosophy of History'' ===
{{main|Theses on the Philosophy of History}}
''Theses on the Philosophy of History'' is often cited as Benjamin's last complete work, having been completed, according to Adorno, in the spring of 1940. The Institute for Social Research, which had relocated to New York, published ''Theses'' in Benjamin's memory in 1942. Margaret Cohen writes in the ''Cambridge Companion to Walter Benjamin'':

{{quote|In the "Concept of History" Benjamin also turned to Jewish mysticism for a model of praxis in dark times, inspired by the kabbalistic precept that the work of the holy man is an activity known as tikkun. According to the kabbalah, God's attributes were once held in vessels whose glass was contaminated by the presence of evil and these vessels had consequently shattered, disseminating their contents to the four corners of the earth. Tikkun was the process of collecting the scattered fragments in the hopes of once more piecing them together. Benjamin fused tikkun with the Surrealist notion that liberation would come through releasing repressed collective material, to produce his celebrated account of the revolutionary historiographer, who sought to grab hold of elided memories as they sparked to view at moments of present danger.}}

In the essay, Benjamin's famed ninth thesis struggles to reconcile the [[Idea of Progress]] in the present with the apparent chaos of the past:

{{quote|A Klee painting named ''[[Angelus Novus]]'' shows an angel looking as though he is about to move away from something he is fixedly contemplating. His eyes are staring, his mouth is open, his wings are spread. This is how one pictures the angel of history. His face is turned toward the past. Where we perceive a chain of events, he sees one single catastrophe which keeps piling wreckage upon wreckage and hurls it in front of his feet. The angel would like to stay, awaken the dead, and make whole what has been smashed. But a storm is blowing from Paradise; it has got caught in his wings with such violence that the angel can no longer close them. The storm irresistibly propels him into the future to which his back is turned, while the pile of debris before him grows skyward. This storm is what we call progress.}}

The final paragraph about the Jewish quest for the [[Messiah]] provides a harrowing final point to Benjamin's work, with its themes of culture, destruction, Jewish heritage and the fight between humanity and nihilism. He brings up the interdiction, in some varieties of Judaism, to try to determine the year when the Messiah would come into the world, and points out that this did not make Jews indifferent to the future "for every second of time was the strait gate through which the Messiah might enter."

=== ''The Origin of German Tragic Drama'' ===
{{main|The Origin of German Tragic Drama}}

''Ursprung des deutschen Trauerspiels'' (''[[The Origin of German Tragic Drama]]'', 1928), is a critical study of German baroque drama, as well as the political and cultural climate of Germany during the [[Counter-Reformation]] (1545–1648). Benjamin presented the work to the University of Frankfurt in 1925 as the (post-doctoral) dissertation meant to earn him the ''[[Habilitation]]'' (qualification) to become a university instructor in Germany.

Professor Schultz of University of Frankfurt found ''The Origin of German Tragic Drama'' inappropriate for his ''Germanistik'' department (Department of German Language and Literature), and passed it to the Department of Aesthetics (philosophy of art), the readers of which likewise dismissed Benjamin's work. The university officials recommended that Benjamin withdraw ''Ursprung des deutschen Trauerspiels'' as a ''Habilitation'' dissertation to avoid formal rejection and public embarrassment.&lt;ref name="BL"/&gt; He heeded the advice, and three years later, in 1928, he published ''The Origin of German Tragic Drama'' as a book.&lt;ref&gt;''Introducing Walter Benjamin'', Howard Cargill, Alex Coles, Andrey Klimowski, 1998, p. 112&lt;/ref&gt;

=== The Arcades Project ===
{{Main|Arcades Project}}The ''[[Arcades Project|Passagenwerk]]'' (Arcades Project, 1927–40) was Walter Benjamin's final, incomplete book about Parisian city life in the 19th century, especially about the ''[[Passages couverts de Paris]]''&amp;nbsp;&amp;ndash; the covered passages that extended the culture of [[flâneur|''flânerie'']] (idling and people-watching) when inclement weather made ''flânerie'' infeasible in the boulevards and streets proper.

The Arcades Project, in its current form, brings together a massive collection of notes which Benjamin filed together over the course of thirteen years, from 1927 to 1940.&lt;ref&gt;Buck-Morss, Susan. ''The Dialectics of Seeing''. The MIT Press, 1991, p. 5.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Arcades Project was published for the first time in 1982, and is over a thousand pages long.

=== Writing style ===
[[Susan Sontag]] said that in Walter Benjamin's writing, sentences did not originate ordinarily, do not progress into one another, and delineate no obvious line of reasoning, as if each sentence "had to say everything, before the inward gaze of total concentration dissolved the subject before his eyes", a "freeze-frame baroque" style of writing and cogitation. "His major essays seem to end just in time, before they self-destruct".&lt;ref&gt;Susan Sontag ''Under the Sign of Saturn,'' p. 129.&lt;/ref&gt; The difficulty of Benjamin's writing style is essential to his philosophical project. Fascinated by notions of reference and constellation, his goal in later works was to use [[Intertextuality|intertexts]] to reveal aspects of the past that cannot, and should not, be understood within greater, monolithic constructs of historical understanding.

Walter Benjamin's writings identify him as a [[Modernism|modernist]] for whom the philosophic merges with the literary: logical philosophic reasoning cannot account for all experience, especially not for self-representation via art. He presented his [[Style (visual arts)|stylistic]] concerns in "The Task of the Translator", wherein he posits that a literary translation, by definition, produces deformations and misunderstandings of the original text. Moreover, in the deformed text, otherwise hidden aspects of the original, source-language text are elucidated, while previously obvious aspects become unreadable. Such translational modification of the source text is productive; when placed in a specific constellation of works and ideas, newly revealed affinities, between historical objects, appear and are productive of philosophical truth.

His work ''The Task of the Translator'' was later commented by the French translation scholar [[Antoine Berman]] (''[[L'âge de la traduction]]'').

== Legacy and reception ==
Since the publication of ''Schriften'' (Writings, 1955), 15 years after his death, Benjamin's work—especially the essay "[[The Work of Art in the Age of Mechanical Reproduction]]" (1936)—has become of seminal importance to academics in the humanities disciplines. In 1968, the first [[Internationale Walter Benjamin Gesellschaft]] was established by the [[Germany|German]] thinker, poet and artist [[Natias Neutert]], as a free association of philosophers, writers, artists, media theoreticians and editors. They did not take Benjamin's body of thought as a scholastic "closed architecture [...], but as one in which all doors, windows and roof hatches are widely open", as the founder Neutert put it—more poetically than politically—in his manifesto.&lt;ref&gt;Cf. ''Mit Walter Benjamin. Gründungsmanifest der Internationalen Walter-Benjamin-Gesellschaft.'' Copyleft Verlag, Hamburg, 1968, p. 6.&lt;/ref&gt; The members felt liberated to take Benjamin's ideas as a welcome touchstone for social change.&lt;ref&gt;Hereto Helmut Salzinger: ''Swinging Benjamin. Verlag Michael Kellner, Hamburg 1990. {{ISBN|3-927623-05-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Like the first Internationale Walter Benjamin Gesellschaft, a new one, established in 2000, researches and discusses the imperative that Benjamin formulated in his ''Theses on the Philosophy of History'': "In every era the attempt must be made anew to wrest the tradition away from a conformism that is about to overpower it."

The successor society was registered in Karlsruhe (Germany); Chairman of the Board of Directors was Bernd Witte, an internationally recognized Benjamin scholar and Professor of Modern German Literature in Düsseldorf (Germany). Its members come from 19 countries, both within and beyond Europe and represents an international forum for discourse. The Society supported research endeavors devoted to the creative and visionary potential of Benjamin's works and their view of 20th century modernism. Special emphasis had been placed upon strengthening academic ties to Latin America and Eastern and Central Europe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://walterbenjamin.info/|title=International Walter Benjamin Society|website=walterbenjamin.info}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The society conducts conferences and exhibitions, as well as interdisciplinary and intermedial events, at regular intervals and different European venues:
* Barcelona Conference – September 2000
* Walter-Benjamin-Evening at Berlin – November 2001
* Walter-Benjamin-Evening at Karlsruhe – January 2003
* Rome Conference – November 2003
* Zurich Conference – October 2004
* Paris Conference – June 2005
* Düsseldorf Conference – June 2005
* Düsseldorf Conference – November 2005
* Antwerpen Conference – May 2006
* Vienna Conference – March 2007&lt;ref&gt;Cf. [http://walterbenjamin.info/ WalterBenjamin.info]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2017 Walter Benjamin's ''Arcades Project'' was reinterpreted in an exhibition curated by [[Jens Hoffmann|Jens Hoffman]], held at the [[Jewish museum|Jewish Museum]] in New York City. The exhibition, entitled "The Arcades: Contemporary Art and Walter Benjamin", features 36 contemporary artworks representing the 36 convolutes of Benjamin's Project.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://thejewishmuseum.org/exhibitions/the-arcades-contemporary-art-and-walter-benjamin|title=The Arcades: Contemporary Art and Walter Benjamin (March 17 - August 6, 2017)|website=''The Jewish Museum''. thejewishmuseum.org|access-date=July 29, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Commemoration ==
[[File:Berliner Gedenktafel Walter Benjamin Prinzregentenstraße 66 Berlin-Wilmersdorf.jpg|thumb|Commemorative plaque for Walter Benjamin, Berlin-Wilmersdorf]]
A commemorative plaque is located by the residence where Benjamin lived in Berlin during the years 1930–1933: (Prinzregentenstraße 66, [[Berlin-Wilmersdorf]]). A commemorative plaque is located in Paris (10 rue Dombasle, [[15th arrondissement of Paris|15th]]) where Benjamin lived in 1938-1940.

Close by [[Kurfürstendamm]], in the district of [[Charlottenburg-Wilmersdorf]], a town square created by [[Hans Kollhoff]] in 2001 was named "Walter-Benjamin-Platz".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.baunetz.de/meldungen/Meldungen_Eroeffnung_der_Leibniz-Kolonnaden_in_Berlin_8927.html ''Stadtplatz aus Stein: Eröffnung der Leibniz-Kolonnaden in Berlin.''] (in German). May&amp;nbsp;14, 2001. ''[[BauNetz]]''. baunetz.de. Retrieved July&amp;nbsp;29, 2017.&lt;/ref&gt; There is a memorial sculpture by the artist Dani Karavan at Portbou, where Walter Benjamin ended his life. It was commissioned to mark 50 years since his death.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://walterbenjaminportbou.cat/en/content/lobra|title=Walter Benjamin a Portbou|website=walterbenjaminportbou.cat}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Wilbour Papyrus''' is a [[papyrus]] purchased by the New York journalist [[Charles Edwin Wilbour]] from a farmer when he visited the island of [[Elephantine]] near [[Aswan]] in 1893. There he purchased seventeen papyri from a local farmer.  He did not realize the importance of his find and when he died in a hotel in Paris his belongings, including the papyri (among these the [[Brooklyn Papyrus]] and the [[Elephantine Papyri]]), were put in storage by the hotel and not returned to his family for nearly half a century. At the request of his widow, they were donated to the [[Brooklyn Museum]].

The Wilbour Papyrus is to ancient Egypt what the census bureau is to us today. It was translated by Alan Gardiner. Most of the first section of the papyrus was lost due to decomposition. The better preserved information begins in section two which starts off with “year 4, [second month of the Inundation-season], day 15 to day 20, making six days, assessment made by (unknown)”. The name of the ruling king at the time was never mentioned but it is believed it was written during the time of Ramesses V. The papyrus is a document that is broken up into two parts, text A and text B. It is roughly 33&amp;nbsp;ft in length, contains 127 columns and over 5,200 lines. It has information on about 95 miles of land and is written by more than one scribe.

Although it is not the largest papyrus ever found, it is the largest in its class. It also contains more information than other papyri which succeed it in size. It is the largest non-funerary papyrus known to ancient Egypt. Even though at this point there has been no evidence of one like it, it is hard to believe the ancient Egyptians did not keep similar documentation. It is possible there was several like this one but was not preserved over the years. This particular papyrus has various information on the late Ramsessid period. This information includes but is not limited to taxation, information about late Ramessid administrative practices, temple economy, population, occupations and land donated to deities.	

There are many theories as to what the original purpose of the papyrus was. Some believe the papyrus could be a copy of the “chief taxing master” which was responsible for temple finance. Others speculate it was the “''jpw''-register" of Amun. No matter what the original purpose was, it is an extremely informative document that gives us an unusual amount of insight on the government during the time of ancient Egypt.

'''"Occupations and Landowners"'''

According to the papyrus the most common occupations encountered were priests, military men, “ladies,” herdsmen, stable-masters, farmers, and scribes. Surprisingly enough the papyrus also lists a good amount of foreigners in its population. It mostly lists Libyans and Near Easterners, it is possible they were foreign mercenaries who had descendants who settled on farmland in which they obtained for serving in the military. In some cases we see if the person who owned the land had deceased. It would then say the land is being cultivated by the sons or daughters.

'''"Agriculture"'''

Even though the papyrus gives us specific information, there is still room for interpretation. The papyrus breaks the land up into four different parts. These parts are known as ''m-drt, ihwty, rowdy, rmnyt''. One word you see continuously debated is the translation of  ''“ihwty”.'' There is a few different thoughts as to what “''ihwty''” actually translates to. Many believe it means “tenant farmer”. Other thoughts of the meaning are “cultivator” or “field laborer”.

''M-drt'' is translated to “split small holder”. A split small holder is a plot of land that is owned by more than one cultivator or tenant farmer. These plots are generally owned by the lower or middle class. As Sally Katary wrote in “Labour on smallholdings in the New Kingdom”, there are roughly 2,245 cultivated plots. Sally tries to break down 93 plots that are mentioned as being ''m-drt''. She bases her number of cultivators needed for each plot off of the size of the plot. She also uses information on how many split plots are owned by the smallholder and the location of the multiple plots owned by the smallholder. By going off of the towns mentioned in both text A and B in the papyrus, we are able to identify locations of the plots. Although we have a vague idea of the locations they have not been able to be completely identified. However, it is possible these locations reveal the hierarchies of the towns and villages exposing the agricultural organization. It is also believed the plots lay across the flood plain, from the Nile banks to the desert edge and along the Bahr Yusuf.

'''"Taxation"'''

	In some cases, the private processor would pay a fixed rate. It is not certain if this rate was paid as a tax fee or as a management fee to the temple. It is possible it went to the temple if the plot was situated on temple land. Taxes were also taken in the form of goods. The larger lots that were worked by field workers were also supervised and paid taxes by turning over 30 percent of their harvest.

'''RP''', the '''International Workshop on Reachability Problems''' is an annual [[academic conference]] in the
field of [[computer science]].

The Reachability Workshop is specifically aimed at gathering together scholars from diverse disciplines and backgrounds interested in [[reachability problem]]s that appear in
* [[Algebraic structure]]s
* [[Computational model]]s
* [[Hybrid system]]s
* [[Logic]] and [[Formal verification]]

Topics of interest include (but are not limited to): Reachability problems in infinite state systems, [[rewriting system]]s, dynamical and hybrid systems; reachability problems in logic and verification; reachability analysis in different computational models, counter timed/ cellular/ communicating automata; [[Petri-Net]]s; computational aspects of algebraic structures (semigroups, groups and rings); frontiers between decidable and undecidable reachability problems; predictability in iterative maps and new computational paradigms.
