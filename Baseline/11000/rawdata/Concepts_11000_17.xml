'''77 Million Paintings''' is a [[digital art]] software/DVD combination by British musician [[Brian Eno]], released in 2006.

The release consists of two discs, one containing the software that creates the randomized music and images that emulate a single screen of one of Eno's video installation pieces. The other is a DVD containing interviews with the artist.

The title is derived from the possible number of combinations of video and music which can be generated by the software, effectively ensuring that the same image/soundscape is never played twice.

An accompanying booklet includes a piece by Nick Robertson describing the intention behind the software, and an article by Brian Eno ("My Light Years") describing his experiments with light and music.

The software was developed by Jake Dowie for both Windows and Macintosh [[operating system]]s.

==First Edition==

Far from containing 77 million paintings, the software consists of 296 original works which are overlaid and combined up to four at a time in a simulation of simultaneous projection onto a common screen. The various images are slowly faded in and out asynchronously before being replaced by another random element. Also the music that accompanies the paintings, if played on a Mac G5 or a Windows PC, is randomly generated in a similar way, so the selection of elements and their duration in the piece are arbitrarily chosen, forming a virtually infinite number of variations.

In conjunction with this, [[Annabeth Robinson]] (AngryBeth Shortbread) recreated the performance in [[Second Life]] by building the performance in a multi-user virtual environment ([[MUVE]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=77-million-paintings-brian-eno|url=http://longnow.org/events/02007/jun/29/77-million-paintings-brian-eno/|work=77 Million Paintings|publisher=The Long Now Foundation|accessdate=1 November 2011| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20110110031856/http://www.longnow.org/events/02007/jun/29/77-million-paintings-brian-eno/| archivedate= 10 January 2011 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Second Edition==

A second edition of "77 Million Paintings", featuring improved morphing and a further two layers of sound, was released on 14 January 2008.

== Project evolution ==
[[File:Opera lighted.jpg|alt=77 Million Paintings projected onto the Sydney Opera House in 2009|thumb|77 Million Paintings projected onto the Sydney Opera House in 2009]]
77 Million Paintings has evolved beyond the domestic environment. It continues to be shown in multiple-monitor configurations in art galleries and is projected onto iconic buildings around the world. In 2009, Eno was invited to project 77 Million Paintings onto the sails of the [[Sydney Opera House]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5386">The '''AK model of economic growth''' is an [[endogenous growth model]] used in the theory of [[economic growth]], a subfield of modern [[macroeconomics]]. In the 1980s it became progressively clearer that the standard [[Neoclassical economics|neoclassical]] exogenous growth models were theoretically unsatisfactory as tools to explore long run growth, as these models predicted economies without [[technological change]] and thus they would eventually [[convergence (mathematics)|converge]] to a [[steady state]], with zero per capita growth. A fundamental reason for this is the diminishing [[return of capital]]; the key property of AK endogenous-growth model is the absence of diminishing returns to capital.  In lieu of the diminishing returns of capital implied by the usual [[parameterization]]s of a [[Cobb–Douglas]] production function, the AK model uses a linear model where output is a [[linear function]] of capital.  Its appearance in most textbooks is to introduce [[endogenous growth theory]].

==Origin of the concept==

In [[neoclassical growth model]]s the economy is assumed to reach a steady state in which all macroeconomic variables grow at the same rate and in the absence of technological progress, per capita growth of these macroeconomic  variable will eventually cease.  These kind of neoclassical prepositions have the resemblance with the philosophical contents in Ricardo and Malthus. The basic underlying assumption of neoclassical philosophical is that diminishing returns to capital operates in the production process.

During the mid-1980s a new beginning of growth theory launched by [[Paul Romer]] in 1986,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Increasing Returns and Long-Run Growth |first=Paul M. |last=Romer |journal=[[Journal of Political Economy]] |volume=94 |issue=5 |year=1986 |pages=1002–1037 |jstor=1833190 |doi=10.1086/261420|citeseerx=10.1.1.589.3348 }}&lt;/ref&gt; where he tried to explain the growth process in a different manner. Thus the dissatisfaction out of neoclassical model motivated to construct new growth theories where the key determination of growth theories are endogenous in the model as in these new theories, the long run growth is not determined by exogenous factors setting up endogenous growth theories.

The simplest version of endogenous model is AK models which assume constant exogenous saving rate and fixed level of technology.  The stickiest assumption of this model is that production function does not include diminishing returns to capital. This means that with this strong assumption the model can lead to endogenous growth.

==Graphical representation of the model==&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[Social capital]] --&gt;

The AK model production function is a special case of a Cobb–Douglas function with [[constant returns to scale]].
: &lt;math&gt;Y=AK^aL^{1-a}\,&lt;/math&gt;

This equation shows a [[Cobb–Douglas production function|Cobb–Douglas]] function where ''Y'' represents the total production in an economy. ''A'' represents [[total factor productivity]], ''K'' is capital, ''L'' is labor, and the parameter &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt; measures the [[output elasticity]] of capital. For the special case in which &lt;math&gt;a = 1&lt;/math&gt;, the production function becomes linear in capital and does not have the property of decreasing returns to scale in the capital stock, which would prevail for any other value of the capital intensity between 0 and 1.

&lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; = [[population growth rate]]&lt;br&gt;
&lt;math&gt; \delta\ &lt;/math&gt; = [[depreciation]] &lt;br&gt;
&lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt; = capital per worker &lt;br&gt;
&lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt; = output/income per worker&lt;br&gt;
&lt;math&gt;L&lt;/math&gt; = labor force &lt;br&gt;
&lt;math&gt;s&lt;/math&gt; = saving rate

In an alternative form &lt;math&gt; Y=AK&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;K&lt;/math&gt; embodies both physical capital and human capital.

: &lt;math&gt;Y=AK\,&lt;/math&gt;

In the above equation A is the level of technology which is positive constant and K represents volume of capital.
Hence, output per capita is:
: &lt;math&gt; \frac{Y}{L}=A \cdot \frac{K}{L} &lt;/math&gt;  i.e.   &lt;math&gt; y = Ak &lt;/math&gt;

The model implicitly assumes that the average product of capital is equal to marginal product of capital which is equivalent to:

&lt;math&gt;A &gt; 0&lt;/math&gt;

The model again assumes that labor force is growing at a constant rate ‘n’ and there is no depreciation of capital.  (δ = 0 )
In this case, the basic differential equation of neo-classical growth model would be:

&lt;math&gt; k(t) = s \cdot f(k) - nk &lt;/math&gt;

Hence, &lt;math&gt; \frac{k(t)}{k} = s \cdot \frac{f(k)}{k} - n &lt;/math&gt;

But in the model   &lt;math&gt; \frac{f(k)}{k} = A &lt;/math&gt;

Thus,   &lt;math&gt; \frac{k(t)}{k} = s \cdot A - n&lt;/math&gt;

{{Criminal procedure (trial)}}

Under [[India]]n [[criminal law]], there is a provision for '''anticipatory bail''' under Section 438 of the [[Criminal Procedure Code]]. Law Commission of India in its 41st report recommended to incorporate this provision in procedure code. &lt;ref&gt;AIR 1980 SC 1632&lt;/ref&gt;This provision allows a person to seek [[bail]] in anticipation of an [[arrest]] on [[Criminal accusation|accusation]] of having committed a non-bailable [[offence (law)|offence]].&lt;ref name=CrPC/&gt;

On filing anticipatory bail, the opposing party is notified about the bail application and the opposition can then contest the bail application in court (public prosecutor can also be used to do this).

Anticipatory bail is a direction to release a person on bail, issued even before the person is arrested.

==Eligibility==

When any person apprehends that there is a move to get him arrested on false or trumped up charges, or due to enmity with someone, or he fears that a false case is likely to be built up against him, he has the right to move the court of Session or the High Court under section 438 of the code of Criminal Procedure for grant of bail in the event of his arrest, and the court may, if it thinks fit, direct that in the event of such arrest, he shall be released on bail.Anticipatory Bail can be granted by [[Sessions Court]], [[High Courts of India|High Court]] and [[Supreme Court of India|Supreme Court]].

==Conditions==

The [[High Courts of India|High Court]] or the court of session may include such conditions in the light of the facts of the particular case, as it may think fit, including:&lt;ref name="Know your Law: Anticipatory bail"&gt;{{cite web|title=Know your Law: Anticipatory bail|url=http://acquitlaw.com/anticipatory-bail/}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

* a condition that the person shall make himself available for interrogation by the police officer as and when required;
* a condition that the person shall not, directly or indirectly, make any inducement, threat or promise to any person acquainted with the facts of the case so as to dissuade him from disclosing such facts to the court or to any police officer;
* a condition that the person shall not leave India without the previous permission of the court.

If such person is thereafter arrested, and is prepared either at the time of arrest or at any time while in the custody of such officer to give bail, he shall be released on bail and the magistrate taking cognizance of such offence decides that warrant should be issued against that person, he shall issue a bailable warrant in conformity with the direction of the court granting anticipatory bail.&lt;ref name=CrPC&gt;{{cite web|title=Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973|url=http://lawyerchandigarh.com/acts/}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Supreme Court while dealing the case of Sidhram Mhetre, held certain conditions imposed by High Court to be not required &amp; contrary to provisions of anticipatory bail.&lt;ref&gt;(2011)1 SCC 694&lt;/ref&gt;

==Qualification==

The applicant must show by disclosing special facts and events that he has reason to believe, that he may be arrested for a non-bailable offence so that the court may take care to specify the offence or offences in respect of which alone the order will be effective and it is not a blanket order covering all other offences.&lt;ref name=CrPC/&gt;

==Cancellation==

An accused is free on bail as long as the same is not cancelled. The High Court or Court of Session may direct that any person who has been released on bail be arrested and commit him to custody on an application moved by the complainant or the prosecution.

{{InfoMaps}}
In [[informal logic]] and [[philosophy]], an '''argument map''' or '''argument diagram''' is a visual representation of the structure of an [[argument]]. An argument map typically includes the key components of the argument, traditionally called the ''[[Logical consequence|conclusion]]'' and the ''[[premise]]s'', also called ''[[Main contention|contention]]'' and ''[[Reason (argument)|reason]]s''.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Freeman|1991|pp=49–90}}&lt;/ref&gt; Argument maps can also show [[co-premise]]s, [[Objection (argument)|objection]]s, [[counterargument]]s, [[rebuttal]]s, and [[Lemma (logic)|lemma]]s. There are different styles of argument map but they are often functionally equivalent and represent an argument's individual claims and the relationships between them.

Argument maps are commonly used in the context of teaching and applying [[critical thinking]].&lt;ref&gt;For example: {{harvnb|Davies|2012}}; {{harvnb|Facione|2013|p=86}}; {{harvnb|Fisher|2004}}; {{harvnb|Kelley|2014|p=73}}; {{harvnb|Kunsch|Schnarr|van Tyle|2014}}; {{harvnb|Walton|2013|p=10}}; {{harvnb|van Gelder|2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The purpose of mapping is to uncover the logical structure of arguments, identify unstated assumptions, evaluate the support an argument offers for a conclusion, and aid understanding of debates. Argument maps are often designed to support deliberation of issues, ideas and arguments in [[wicked problem]]s.&lt;ref&gt;For example: {{harvnb|Culmsee|Awati|2013}}; {{harvnb|Hoffmann|Borenstein|2013}}; {{harvnb|Metcalfe|Sastrowardoyo|2013}}; Ricky Ohl, [https://books.google.com/books?id=loa4BAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA360 "Computer supported argument visualisation: modelling in consultative democracy around wicked problems"], in {{harvnb|Okada|Buckingham Shum|Sherborne|2014|pp=361–380}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An argument map is not to be confused with a [[concept map]] or a [[mind map]], two other kinds of [[Graph (discrete mathematics)|node–link diagram]] which have different constraints on nodes and links.&lt;ref&gt;For example: {{harvnb|Davies|2010}}; {{harvnb|Hunter|2008}}; {{harvnb|Okada|Buckingham Shum|Sherborne|2014|pp=vii–x, 4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Key features==
A number of different kinds of argument map have been proposed but the most common, which Chris Reed and Glenn Rowe called the ''standard diagram'',&lt;ref name="ReedRowe64"&gt;{{harvnb|Reed|Rowe|2007|p=64}}&lt;/ref&gt; consists of a [[tree structure]] with each of the reasons leading to the conclusion. There is no consensus as to whether the conclusion should be at the top of the tree with the reasons leading up to it or whether it should be at the bottom with the reasons leading down to it.&lt;ref name="ReedRowe64"/&gt; Another variation diagrams an argument from left to right.&lt;ref&gt;For example: {{harvnb|Walton|2013|pp=18–20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[Doug Walton]] and colleagues, an argument map has two basic components: "One component is a set of circled numbers arrayed as points. Each number represents a proposition (premise or conclusion) in the argument being diagrammed. The other component is a set of lines or arrows joining the points. Each line (arrow) represents an inference. The whole network of points and lines represents a kind of overview of the reasoning in the given argument..."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Reed|Walton|Macagno|2007|p=2}}&lt;/ref&gt; With the introduction of software for producing argument maps, it has become common for argument maps to consist of boxes containing the actual propositions rather than numbers referencing those propositions.

There is disagreement on the terminology to be used when describing argument maps,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Freeman|1991|pp=49–90}}; {{harvnb|Reed|Rowe|2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; but the ''standard diagram'' contains the following structures:

'''Dependent premises''' or '''co-premises''', where at least one of the joined premises requires another premise before it can give support to the conclusion: An argument with this structure has been called a ''linked'' argument.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Harrell|2010|p=19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Dependent premises.jpg|thumb|centre|100px|Statements 1 and 2 are dependent premises or co-premises]]

'''Independent premises''', where the premise can support the conclusion on its own: Although independent premises may jointly make the conclusion more convincing, this is to be distinguished from situations where a premise gives no support unless it is joined to another premise. Where several premises or groups of premises lead to a final conclusion the argument might be described as ''convergent''. This is distinguished from a ''divergent'' argument where a single premise might be used to support two separate conclusions.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Freeman|1991|pp=91–110}}; {{harvnb|Harrell|2010|p=20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Independent premises.jpg|thumb|centre|150px|Statements 2, 3, 4 are independent premises]]

'''Intermediate conclusions''' or '''sub-conclusions''', where a claim is supported by another claim that is used in turn to support some further claim, i.e. the final conclusion or another intermediate conclusion: In the following diagram, statement '''4''' is an intermediate conclusion in that it is a conclusion in relation to statement '''5''' but is a premise in relation to the final conclusion, i.e. statement '''1'''. An argument with this structure is sometimes called a ''complex'' argument. If there is a single chain of claims containing at least one intermediate conclusion, the argument is sometimes described as a ''serial'' argument or a ''chain'' argument.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Beardsley|1950|pp=18–19}}; {{harvnb|Reed|Walton|Macagno|2007|pp=3–8}}; {{harvnb|Harrell|2010|pp=19–21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Intermediate conclusion.jpg|thumb|centre|150px|Statement 4 is an intermediate conclusion or sub-conclusion]]

Each of these structures can be represented by the equivalent "box and line" approach to argument maps. In the following diagram, the ''contention'' is shown at the top, and the boxes linked to it represent supporting ''reasons'', which comprise one or more ''premises''. The green arrow indicates that the two ''reasons'' support the ''contention'':

[[File:A box and line diagram.png|thumb|center|A box and line diagram]]

Argument maps can also represent counterarguments. In the following diagram, the two ''objections'' weaken the ''contention'', while the ''reasons'' support the ''premise'' of the objection:

==Representing an argument as an argument map==

===Diagramming written text===
A written text can be transformed into an argument map by following a sequence of steps. [[Monroe Beardsley]]'s 1950 book ''Practical Logic'' recommended the following procedure:&lt;ref name="Beardsley"&gt;{{harvnb|Beardsley|1950}}&lt;/ref&gt;
#Separate statements by brackets and number them.
#Put circles around the logical indicators.
#Supply, in parenthesis, any logical indicators that are left out.
#Set out the statements in a diagram in which arrows show the relationships between statements.

[[File:Diagram using Beardsley's procedure.jpg|thumb|right|100px|A diagram of the example from Beardsley's ''Practical Logic'']]

Beardsley gave the first example of a text being analysed in this way:

:Though &lt;span style="color:red;"&gt;① [&lt;/span&gt;people who talk about the "social significance" of the arts don’t like to admit it&lt;span style="color:red;"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span style="color:red;"&gt;② [&lt;/span&gt;music and painting are bound to suffer when they are turned into mere vehicles for propaganda&lt;span style="color:red;"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;. &lt;span style="width:100%; border:solid 2px blue; padding-left:5px; padding-right:5px; border-radius:25px;"&gt;For&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style="color:red;"&gt;③ [&lt;/span&gt;propaganda appeals to the crudest and most vulgar feelings&lt;span style="color:red;"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;: &lt;span style="color:red;"&gt;(for)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style="color:red;"&gt;④ [&lt;/span&gt;look at the academic monstrosities produced by the official Nazi painters&lt;span style="color:red;"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;. What is more important, &lt;span style="color:red;"&gt;⑤ [&lt;/span&gt;art must be an end in itself for the artist&lt;span style="color:red;"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span style="width:100%; border:solid 2px blue; padding-left:5px; padding-right:5px; border-radius:25px;"&gt;because&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style="color:red;"&gt;⑥ [&lt;/span&gt;the artist can do the best work only in an atmosphere of complete freedom&lt;span style="color:red;"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;.

Beardsley said that the conclusion in this example is statement ②. Statement ④ needs to be rewritten as a declarative sentence, e.g. "Academic monstrosities [were] produced by the official Nazi painters." Statement ① points out that the conclusion isn't accepted by everyone, but statement ① is omitted from the diagram because it doesn't support the conclusion. Beardsley said that the logical relation between statement ③ and statement ④ is unclear, but he proposed to diagram statement ④ as supporting statement ③.

[[File:Using Harrell's procedure.jpg|thumb|right|200px|A box and line diagram of Beardsley's example, produced using Harrell's procedure]]

More recently, philosophy professor Maralee Harrell recommended the following procedure:&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Harrell|2010|p=28}}&lt;/ref&gt;
#Identify all the claims being made by the author.
#Rewrite them as independent statements, eliminating non-essential words.
#Identify which statements are premises, sub-conclusions, and the main conclusion.
#Provide missing, implied conclusions and implied premises. (This is optional depending on the purpose of the argument map.)
#Put the statements into boxes and draw a line between any boxes that are linked.
#Indicate support from premise(s) to (sub)conclusion with arrows.

===Diagramming as thinking===
Argument maps are useful not only for representing and analyzing existing writings, but also for thinking through issues as part of a [[Problem structuring methods|problem-structuring process]] or [[writing process]].&lt;ref&gt;This is related to the distinction between "knowledge telling" and "knowledge transforming" in [[composition studies]]: see, for example, {{harvnb|Chryssafidou|2014|pp=38–39, 413}}&lt;/ref&gt; The use of such argument analysis for thinking through issues has been called "reflective argumentation".&lt;ref&gt;For example: {{harvnb|Hoffmann|Borenstein|2013}}; {{harvnb|Hoffmann|2016}}; {{harvnb|Hoffmann|2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An argument map, unlike a [[decision tree]], does not tell how to make a decision, but the process of choosing a [[Coherentism|coherent]] position (or [[reflective equilibrium]]) based on the structure of an argument map can be represented as a decision tree.&lt;ref&gt;See section 4.2, "Argument maps as reasoning tools", in {{harvnb|Brun|Betz|2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

===The philosophical origins and tradition of argument mapping===
[[File:Whatley.png|thumb|From Whately's Elements of Logic p467, 1852 edition]]
In the ''Elements of Logic'', which was published in 1826 and issued in many subsequent editions,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Whately|1834}} (first published 1826)&lt;/ref&gt; Archbishop [[Richard Whately]] gave probably the first form of an argument map, introducing it with the suggestion that "many students probably will find it a very clear and convenient mode of exhibiting the logical analysis of the course of argument, to draw it out in the form of a Tree, or Logical Division".

However, the technique did not become widely used, possibly because for complex arguments, it involved much writing and rewriting of the premises.

[[File:Wigmore chart.png|thumb|Wigmore evidence chart, from 1905]]
Legal philosopher and theorist [[John Henry Wigmore]] produced maps of legal arguments using numbered premises in the early 20th century,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Wigmore|1913}}&lt;/ref&gt; based in part on the ideas of 19th century philosopher [[Henry Sidgwick]] who used lines to indicate relations between terms.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Goodwin|2000}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Anglophone argument diagramming in the 20th century===
Dealing with the failure of [[Formal system|formal]] reduction of informal argumentation, English speaking [[argumentation theory]] developed diagrammatic approaches to informal reasoning over a period of fifty years.

[[Monroe Beardsley]] proposed a form of argument diagram in 1950.&lt;ref name="Beardsley"/&gt; His method of marking up an argument and representing its components with linked numbers became a standard and is still widely used. He also introduced terminology that is still current describing ''convergent'', ''divergent'' and ''serial'' arguments.

[[File:Toulmindiag.png|thumb|A [[Toulmin method|Toulmin argument diagram]], redrawn from his 1959 ''Uses of Argument'']]
[[File:Toulmingeneral.png|thumb|A generalised Toulmin diagram]]
[[Stephen Toulmin]], in his groundbreaking and influential 1958 book ''The Uses of Argument'',&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Toulmin|2003}} (first published 1958)&lt;/ref&gt; identified several elements to an argument which have been generalized. The [[Toulmin method|Toulmin diagram]] is widely used in educational critical teaching.&lt;ref name="Simon06"&gt;{{harvnb|Simon|Erduran|Osborne|2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Böttcher|Meisert|2011}}; {{harvnb|Macagno|Konstantinidou|2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Whilst Toulmin eventually had a significant impact on the development of [[informal logic]] he had little initial impact and the Beardsley approach to diagramming arguments along with its later developments became the standard approach in this field. Toulmin introduced something that was missing from Beardsley's approach. In Beardsley, "arrows link reasons and conclusions (but) no support is given to the implication itself between them. There is no theory, in other words, of inference distinguished from logical deduction, the passage is always deemed not controversial and not subject to support and evaluation".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Reed|Walton|Macagno|2007|p=8}}&lt;/ref&gt; Toulmin introduced the concept of [[Warrant (rhetoric)|''warrant'']] which "can be considered as representing the reasons behind the inference, the backing that authorizes the link".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Reed|Walton|Macagno|2007|p=9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Beardsley's approach was refined by Stephen N. Thomas, whose 1973 book ''Practical Reasoning In Natural Language''&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Thomas|1997}} (first published 1973)&lt;/ref&gt; introduced the term ''linked'' to describe arguments where the premises necessarily worked together to support the conclusion.&lt;ref name="SnoeckHenkemans"&gt;{{harvnb|Snoeck Henkemans|2000|p=453}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the actual distinction between dependent and independent premises had been made prior to this.&lt;ref name="SnoeckHenkemans"/&gt; The introduction of the linked structure made it possible for argument maps to represent missing or "hidden" premises. In addition, Thomas suggested showing reasons both ''for'' and ''against'' a conclusion with the reasons ''against'' being represented by dotted arrows. Thomas introduced the term ''argument diagram'' and defined ''basic reasons'' as those that were not supported by any others in the argument and the ''final conclusion'' as that which was not used to support any further conclusion.

[[File:Scrivendiag.png|thumb|Scriven's argument diagram. The explicit premise 1 is conjoined with additional unstated premises a and b to imply 2.]]
[[Michael Scriven]] further developed the Beardsley-Thomas approach in his 1976 book ''Reasoning''.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Scriven|1976}}&lt;/ref&gt; Whereas Beardsley had said "At first, write out the statements...after a little practice, refer to the statements by number alone"&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Beardsley|1950|p=21}}&lt;/ref&gt; Scriven advocated clarifying the meaning of the statements, listing them and then using a tree diagram with numbers to display the structure. Missing premises (unstated assumptions) were to be included and indicated with an alphabetical letter instead of a number to mark them off from the explicit statements. Scriven introduced counterarguments in his diagrams, which Toulmin had defined as rebuttal.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Reed|Walton|Macagno|2007|pp=10–11}}&lt;/ref&gt; This also enabled the diagramming of "balance of consideration" arguments.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|van Eemeren|Grootendorst|Snoeck Henkemans|Blair|1996|p=175}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1998 a series of large-scale argument maps released by [[Robert E. Horn]] stimulated widespread interest in argument mapping.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Holmes|1999}}; {{harvnb|Horn|1998}}; Robert E. Horn, [http://www.stanford.edu/~rhorn/a/topic/arg/artclCmptrSpArgmttn.pdf "Infrastructure for navigating interdisciplinary debates: critical decisions for representing argumentation"], in {{harvnb|Kirschner|Buckingham Shum|Carr|2003|pp=165–184}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Development of computer-supported argument visualization===
[[Human–computer interaction]] pioneer [[Douglas Engelbart]], in a famous 1962 technical report on [[intelligence augmentation]], envisioned in detail something like argument-mapping software as an integral part of future intelligence-augmenting computer interfaces:&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Engelbart|1962}}; For an account of Engelbart's place in the history of computer-supported argument visualization, see, e.g., Simon Buckingham Shum, [http://simon.buckinghamshum.net/wp-content/uploads/2008/03/VisualizingArgumentation-Roots.pdf "The roots of computer supported argument visualization"], in {{harvnb|Kirschner|Buckingham Shum|Carr|2003|pp=3–24}}&lt;/ref&gt; {{Quote|You usually think of an argument as a serial sequence of steps of reason, beginning with known facts, assumptions, etc., and progressing toward a conclusion. Well, we do have to think through these steps serially, and we usually do list the steps serially when we write them out because that is pretty much the way our papers and books have to present them—they are pretty limiting in the symbol structuring they enable us to use.&amp;nbsp;... To help us get better comprehension of the structure of an argument, we can also call forth a schematic or graphical display. Once the antecedent-consequent links have been established, the computer can automatically construct such a display for us.|source=Douglas Engelbart, "Augmenting human intellect: a conceptual framework" (1962)}}

In the middle to late 1980s, [[hypertext]] [[software application]]s that supported argument visualization were developed, including [[NoteCards]] and [[gIBIS]]; the latter generated an on-screen graphical hypertextual map of an [[issue-based information system]], a model of argumentation developed by Werner Kunz and [[Horst Rittel]] in the 1970s.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Conklin|Begeman|1988}}, on [[gIBIS]]; {{harvnb|Halasz|1988}}, on [[NoteCards]]; {{harvnb|Kirschner|Buckingham Shum|Carr|2003|pp=14–15}}, on the place of both in the history of computer-supported argument visualization&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1990s, [[Tim van Gelder]] and colleagues developed a series of software applications that permitted an argument map's premises to be fully stated and edited in the diagram, rather than in a legend.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|van Gelder|2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Van Gelder's first program, Reason!Able, was superseded by two subsequent programs, bCisive and Rationale.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Berg|van Gelder|Patterson|Teppema|2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Throughout the 1990s and 2000s, many other software applications were developed for argument visualization. By 2013, more than 60 such software systems existed.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Walton|2013|p=11}}&lt;/ref&gt; One of the differences between these software systems is whether collaboration is supported.&lt;ref name="Scheuer10"&gt;{{harvnb|Scheuer|Loll|Pinkwart|McLaren|2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Single-user argumentation systems include Convince Me, iLogos, LARGO, Athena, [[Araucaria (software)|Araucaria]], and Carneades; small group argumentation systems include Digalo, QuestMap, [[Compendium (software)|Compendium]], Belvedere, and AcademicTalk; community argumentation systems include [[Debategraph]] and [[Collaboratorium]].&lt;ref name="Scheuer10"/&gt;

==Applications==
Argument maps have been applied in many areas, but foremost in educational, academic and business settings, including [[design rationale]].&lt;ref name="Applications"&gt;{{harvnb|Kirschner|Buckingham Shum|Carr|2003}}; {{harvnb|Okada|Buckingham Shum|Sherborne|2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Argument maps are also used in [[forensic science]],&lt;ref&gt;For example: {{harvnb|Bex|2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[law]], and [[artificial intelligence]].&lt;ref&gt;For example: {{harvnb|Verheij|2005}}; {{harvnb|Reed|Walton|Macagno|2007}}; {{harvnb|Walton|2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has also been proposed that argument mapping has a great potential to improve how we understand and execute democracy, in reference to the ongoing evolution of [[e-democracy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hilbert|2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Difficulties with the philosophical tradition===
It has traditionally been hard to separate teaching critical thinking from the philosophical tradition of teaching [[logic]] and method, and most critical thinking textbooks have been written by philosophers. [[Informal logic]] textbooks are replete with philosophical examples, but it is unclear whether the approach in such textbooks transfers to non-philosophy students.&lt;ref name="Simon06" /&gt; There appears to be little statistical effect after such classes. Argument mapping, however, has a measurable effect according to many studies.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Twardy|2004}}; {{harvnb|Álvarez Ortiz|2007}}; {{harvnb|Harrell|2008}}; Yanna Rider and Neil Thomason, [https://books.google.com/books?id=loa4BAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA112 "Cognitive and pedagogical benefits of argument mapping: LAMP guides the way to better thinking"], in {{harvnb|Okada|Buckingham Shum|Sherborne|2014|pp=113–134}}; {{harvnb|Dwyer|2011}}; {{harvnb|Davies|2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, instruction in argument mapping has been shown to improve the critical thinking skills of business students.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Carrington|Chen|Davies|Kaur|2011}}; {{harvnb|Kunsch|Schnarr|van Tyle|2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Evidence that argument mapping improves critical thinking ability===
There is empirical evidence that the skills developed in argument-mapping-based critical thinking courses substantially transfer to critical thinking done without argument maps. Alvarez's meta-analysis found that such critical thinking courses produced gains of around 0.70 SD, about twice as much as standard critical-thinking courses.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Álvarez Ortiz|2007|pp=69–70 ''et seq''}}&lt;/ref&gt; The tests used in the reviewed studies were standard critical-thinking tests.

===How argument mapping helps with critical thinking===
{{Refimprove section|date=May 2017|small=y}}
The use of argument mapping has occurred within a number of disciplines, such as philosophy, management reporting, military and intelligence analysis, and public debates.&lt;ref name="Applications"/&gt;

*''Logical structure'': Argument maps display an argument's logical structure more clearly than does the standard linear way of presenting arguments.
*''Critical thinking concepts'': In learning to argument map, students master such key critical thinking concepts as "reason", "objection", "premise", "conclusion", "inference", "rebuttal", "unstated assumption", "co-premise", "strength of evidence", "logical structure", "independent evidence", etc. Mastering such concepts is not just a matter of memorizing their definitions or even being able to apply them correctly; it is also understanding why the distinctions these words mark are important and using that understanding to guide one's reasoning.
*''Visualization'': Humans are highly visual and argument mapping may provide students with a basic set of visual schemas with which to understand argument structures.
*''More careful reading and listening'': Learning to argument map teaches people to read and listen more carefully, and highlights for them the key questions "What is the logical structure of this argument?" and "How does this sentence fit into the larger structure?" In-depth cognitive processing is thus more likely.
*''More careful writing and speaking'': Argument mapping helps people to state their reasoning and evidence more precisely, because the reasoning and evidence must fit explicitly into the map's logical structure.
*''Literal and intended meaning'': Often, many statements in an argument do not precisely assert what the author meant. Learning to argument map enhances the complex skill of distinguishing literal from intended meaning.
*''Externalization'': Writing something down and reviewing what one has written often helps reveal gaps and clarify one's thinking. Because the logical structure of argument maps is clearer than that of linear prose, the benefits of mapping will exceed those of ordinary writing.
*''Anticipating replies'': Important to critical thinking is anticipating objections and considering the plausibility of different rebuttals. Mapping develops this anticipation skill, and so improves analysis.

==Standards==

===Argument Interchange Format===
{{main|Argument Interchange Format}}
The Argument Interchange Format, AIF, is an international effort to develop a representational mechanism for exchanging argument resources between research groups, tools, and domains using a semantically rich language.&lt;ref&gt;See the [http://www.arg.dundee.ac.uk/people/chris/publications/2006/aif_final.pdf AIF original draft description] (2006) and the [http://www.argdf.org/source/ArgDF_Ontology.rdfs full AIF-RDF ontology specifications] in [[RDFS]] format.&lt;/ref&gt; AIF-RDF is the extended ontology represented in the [[Resource Description Framework]] Schema (RDFS) semantic language. Though AIF is still something of a moving target, it is settling down.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Bex|Modgil|Prakken|Reed|2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Legal Knowledge Interchange Format===
{{main|Legal Knowledge Interchange Format}}
The Legal Knowledge Interchange Format (LKIF)&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Boer|Winkels|Vitali|2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; was developed in the European ESTRELLA project&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Estrella project website |url=http://www.estrellaproject.org/ |website=estrellaproject.org |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160212103522/http://www.estrellaproject.org/ |archivedate=2016-02-12 |accessdate=2016-02-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; and designed with the goal of becoming a standard for representing and interchanging policy, legislation and cases, including their justificatory arguments, in the legal domain. LKIF builds on and uses the [[Web Ontology Language]] (OWL) for representing concepts and includes a reusable basic ontology of legal concepts.

'''Basking in reflected glory''' ('''BIRGing''') is a self-serving [[cognition]] whereby an individual associates themselves with known successful others such that the winner's success becomes the individual's own accomplishment.&lt;ref&gt;Aronson, W. A. (2007). Social Psychology 6th Edition. New Jersey: Pearson Education, Inc.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Cialdinin, R. B., Kenrick, D. T., Neuberg C. B. (2010). Social Psychology 5th Edition. Boston: Pearson Education, Inc.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:BINRG fan pic.png|thumb|right|Example of BIRGing]] --&gt;
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Fans We Won.jpg|thumb|right|Example 2: Cheering Fans]] --&gt;
The affiliation of another's success is enough to stimulate self glory.  The individual does not need to be personally involved in the successful action. To BIRG, they must simply associate themselves with the success. Examples of BIRGing include anything from sharing a home state with a past or present famous person, to religious affiliations, to sports teams.  For example, when a fan of a football team wears the team's jersey and boasts after a win, this fan is engaging in BIRGing.  A parent with a bumper sticker reading "My child is an honor student" is basking in the reflected glory of their child.  While many people have anecdotal accounts of BIRGing, social psychologists seek to find experimental investigations delving into BIRGing. Within social psychology, BIRGing is thought to enhance self-esteem and to be a component of self-management.

BIRGing has connections to [[social identity|social identity theory]], which explains how [[self-esteem]] and self-evaluation can be enhanced by the identification with another person's success by basking in reflected glory not earned (The American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language: Fourth Edition, 2000). Social identity is the individual's [[self-concept]] derived from perceived membership of social groups. High self-esteem is typically a perception of oneself as attractive, competent, likeable and a morally good person. The perception of having these attributes makes the person feel as if they are more attractive to the outside social world and thus more desirable to others to be in a social relationship.( Shavelson, Richard J.; Bolus, Roger (1982))

BIRGing is a widespread and important [[impression management]] technique to counter any threats to self-esteem and maintain positive relations with others.  Some positive effects of BIRGing include increasing individual self-esteem and a sense of accomplishment. It can show pride of self, and pride for the other person's success, which in turn boosts one's own self-esteem.  BIRGing can be negative when done too extensively that the individual engaging in BIRGing becomes delusional or forgets the reality that they did not actually accomplish the successful event.

The opposite of BIRGing is '''cutting off reflected failure''' ('''CORFing''').  This is the idea that people tend to disassociate themselves from lower-status individuals because they do not want their reputations 
affected by associating with the people who are considered failures.

==Empirical findings==

One of the most influential studies of this phenomenon was done by [[Robert Cialdini]] in 1976 known as The Three (Football)  Field Study.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.academia.edu/570635/Basking_in_reflected_glory_Three_football_field_studies&lt;/ref&gt; He discovered that the students sought to have the success of their football team linked to them by wearing school-identified apparel. These students associated themselves with a success, even though they in no way affected or caused the success. Through three different experiments, Cialdini was able to demonstrate the BIRGing phenomenon. 
The first experiment demonstrated BIRGing by showing that students have a greater tendency to wear apparel with the university's colors and name after the football team had won a game. In the second experiment, subjects used the pronoun "we" to associate themselves more with a positive than a negative source.  This was shown most prominently when their public reputation was at risk. When the subjects failed a task, they had a greater tendency to affiliate themselves with a winner, and less of a tendency to associate themselves with a loser. The third experiment replicated the finding that students used the pronoun "we" more when describing a victory compared to a non-victory by their school's football team. The researchers found that BIRGing is an attempt to enhance one's public image. The tendency to proclaim a connection with a positive source was strongest when one's public image was threatened.  Thus, people bask in reflected glory to boost their self-esteem by associating themselves with a positive source.

A feeling of involvement is also necessary for BIRGing to occur. It is frequently seen as a cognitive process that affects behavior. In Bernhardt's ''et al.'' (1998) study, researchers examined physiological processes related to Basking in Reflected Glory, specifically, changes in the production of endocrine hormones. [[Endocrine system]] Fans watched their favorite sports teams (basketball and soccer) win or lose. The men's testosterone levels increased while watching their team win, but decreased while watching their team lose. Thus, this study shows that physiological processes may be involved with BIRGing, in addition to the known changes in self-esteem and cognition.

The opposite of BIRGing is '''cutting off reflected failure''' ('''CORFing'''). This is the idea that people tend to disassociate themselves from lower-status individuals because they do not want their reputations affected by associating with the people who are considered failures. Boen ''et al.'' (2002) demonstrate this effect in a political context.  They examined houses with at least a poster or lawn sign supporting a political candidate days before elections in Belgium. The houses that showed support for the winning candidate displayed their posters and lawn signs for a longer period after the elections than did those who supported the loser. CORFing behavior was studied in basketball fans after a defeat (Bizman &amp; Yinzon, 2002), where the fans refuse to take a team poster, removed their posters or paraphernalia, avoided other fans and stayed in a bad mood after a defeat. Thus, the tendency for individuals to display their association with a successful source and a tendency for individuals to conceal their association with a losing team was empirically supported.

These empirical studies show how even in controlled situations, people unconsciously seek acceptance by associating themselves with successful individuals.  Whether this is accomplished by wearing brand names or parents covering their car with stickers about how talented their child is, basking in reflected glory has been found in both the naturalistic and experimental setting.

==Major theoretical approaches==

Although Cialdini's studies introduced the concept of BIRGing to the public and its relevance to [[social psychology]], an operational definition is quite difficult to form. With such a wide range of possible examples, there is no set criteria by which to clearly recognize BIRGing. Rather, by a classical definition, it is more described as a subjective feeling possessed by one individual who seeks to gain acceptance or respect by associating themselves with the successes of others. However, over recent years, advances in technology (among other domains) have challenged the classic definition of BIRGing. For example, when [[Apple Computer]]s became very successful, many individuals not only purchased Apple  products, but many more sought jobs or other associations with the company.&lt;ref&gt;https://books.google.com/books?id=s_ecX2zY-EEC&amp;pg=PA202&amp;lpg=PA202&amp;dq=apple+computers+basking+in+reflected+glory&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=46V2x8AmwU&amp;sig=8u6OyNq52KUr42kZ-oJLwJMrATI&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=UymFVPqOJbDgsASx3oG4Cg&amp;ved=0CDAQ6AEwAg#v=onepage&amp;q=apple%20computers%20basking%20in%20reflected%20glory&amp;f=false&lt;/ref&gt; Contemporary BIRGing in today's world can be seen by individuals not only associating themselves with the success of other people or groups, as was originally thought by [[Robert Cialdini|Cialdini]] among others; Rather, BIRGing is the association of oneself to any company, business, or activity which is popular or highly regarded.

[[Facebook]], [[Twitter]], and other [[social networking]] sites have increased BIRGing with popular brands, as it allows everyone to post their affinity for or their associations with popular companies, media, businesses, etc. Furthermore, the ability for everyone to follow their favorite athletes, actors, etc. on [[Facebook]] or [[Twitter]] allows for a closer connection to and knowledge of these celebrities, therefore leading to more BIRGing. Thus, the spread of technology has not only increased the realms under which BIRGing may fall, but also increased the ease with which individuals may partake in BIRGing.

Psychological approaches to BIRGing would include [[Ludwig Lewisohn]]'s behavioral approach, [[Charles Darwin]]'s evolutionary approach, and to some extent even [[Sigmund Freud]]'s [[Psychodynamic theory|psychodynamic]] approach. The behavioral approach is relevant to BIRGing as it analyzes the behavior and success of others. If one partakes in observing this behavior, they can learn which actions and people are successful or popular and can then engage in BIRGing by associating themselves  with these actions or people. Darwin's evolutionary approach can also be used to analyze BIRGing due to the idea behind [[survival of the fittest]]. In contemporary psychology, survival of the fittest applies to achieving the greatest successes possible in order to ensure the passage of one's genes into future generations. From this biological perspective, it is favorable to be popular and respected, as more mating opportunities will present themselves. This can be seen in BIRGing as individuals associate themselves with popular, attractive, or respected actions and people in order to be perceived as having more successes. Freud's psychodynamic theory can be applied to BIRGing in terms of the [[super ego]]'s relationship to the [[Id, ego and super-ego#Ego|ego]]. The [[super ego]] refers to the ideal self-image; it constitutes a view of one's self as perfect. The ego refers to the real self, meaning our consciousness and perceptions of our current selves. Thus, if an individual seeks to gain more respect or popularity, the [[super ego]] may lead to BIRGing, as that individual will associate themselves  with popular and respected entities in order to increase that individual's notion of ego.

==Role of deindividuation==

Another equally important contributing influence is [[deindividuation]], a psychological state characterized by partial or complete loss of self-awareness, diffused responsibility, and decreased concern about our own behavior resulting in the abandonment of norms, restraints and inhibitions due to the involvement in a group.(  Diener, E., Fraser, S. C., Beaman, A. L., &amp; Kelem, R. T. (1976))  The individual loses their sense of self as they participate in the group's activities and choices. Deindividuation involves a loss of [[self-awareness]] which is essentially the degree to which one's attention is focused on the self, resulting in comparisons against meaningful standards. When spectators become deindividuated, their self-awareness decreases and they cease to compare their behavior against these social norms. The group's norms become their only focus, and therefore the social norms. Consequentially, situational forces are more influential. Without the comparison process of self-awareness, behavior is more likely to be inconsistent with attitude.

==Applications==

BIRGing is a common aspect of everyday life.  Anecdotal evidence explains how people make connections with highly positive or successful people.  States and cities list the names of famous entertainers, political candidates, beauty contest winners, etc. who were born there.  In encounters with a successful individual or famous celebrity one may recount the story several times in order to bask in the glory because one has a sense of pride after meeting such an individual. People associate with certain companies and schools in order to have a connection to a famous individual who represents these organizations. Humans are always trying to boost their self-esteem, so they continually attempt to bask in reflected glory.

Extra real-world examples:
*Bragging about a famous relative (ex: "my great, great, great grandfather was U.S. President [[Abraham Lincoln]]'s cousin")
*School/Accomplishment car decal in terms of adding a "bumper sticker" (ex: [[Vanderbilt University]] or My son is an [[Eagle Scout (Boy Scouts of America)|Eagle Scout]])
*Wearing a team jersey after they win (ex: Wearing a [[Green Bay Packers]] jersey after the [[2011 Super Bowl]] or wearing Seahawks paraphernalia during and after they win a game)

==Controversies==

Most psychologists hold this theory to be true based on substantial research and evidence.{{vague|date=September 2014}} However, it is difficult to define and operationalize  basking in reflected glory (discussed in "Major Theoretical Approaches"). Because examples of BIRGing are so different and unique, there is no set criterion. The classical definition of BIRGing describes it as a subjective feeling possessed by one individual who seeks to gain acceptance or respect by associating themselves with the successes of others. However, in recent years changes in culture and industry have challenged this classic definition. With these changes people are not only associating with other people, but with companies, brands, and organizations. This ability to associate with more than just the public to gain status has created the need for a new definition of Basking in Reflected Glory.

==Limitations==

Limitations that apply to both CORFing and BIRGing are perceptions and expectations about performance and how they have an impact. Many scholars have found that the confirmation and disconfirmation of the expected victory or loss has a significant effect on BIRGing and CORFing. For example, if one predicts that one's favorite team is going to lose, one is less likely to be afraid to associate with that team because they predicted the loss. This supports that a person is more likely to participate in BIRGing or CORFing if their public image is being highly threatened.
In addition, most studies only test for the identification with one favorite team, there haven't been many studies on the effects of having multiple favorite teams. In one article it suggests that, "some sport fans have more than one 'favorite team' and choose to identify with a winning team to afford more opportunities to BIRG" (Spinda, 2011). This suggestion could impact the occurrences of BIRGing and CORFing and therefore needs to be investigated further.

A study done by Spinda (2011), found significant differences between male and female BIRGing and CORFing constructs.

==Conclusion==

Basking in Reflected Glory  is most often noted through the act of  BIRGing. Whether it is the sticker on a parent's van that says "Proud parent of an Honor Roll student" or having jerseys/posters of one's favorite sports team, humans attempt to improve their self-esteem and [[self-worth]] through basking in other's triumphs and broadcasting their association with powerful/successful people. Basking in reflected glory has the potential to create self glory and is connected with social identity theory.

There have been psychological studies done that confirm the ideas and theories of basking in reflected glory. The first major study was done by Cialdini as he researched BIRGing in winning/losing football fans. Research by Boen ''et al.'' has also confirmed the opposite of BIRGing, cutting off reflected failure (the idea that people tend to disassociate themselves with people of lower status). Basking in reflected glory is not necessarily negative unless it is taken to the extreme and a person only views himself in terms of his affiliations with his BIRGing group. Increases in technology have led to an increase in the ability to bask in reflected glory; a person can now advertise their associations on Facebook, Twitter, and other social networking sites.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5930">'''Bioconversion''', also known as ''biotransformation'', is the conversion of organic materials, such as plant or animal waste, into usable products or [[energy source]]s by biological processes or agents, such as certain microorganisms. One example is the industrial production of [[cortisone]], which one step is the bioconversion of [[progesterone]] to 11-alpha-Hydroxyprogesterone by ''[[Rhizopus nigricans]].'' Another example is the [[Bioconversion of Glycerol to 1,3-Propanediol|bioconversion of glycerol to 1,3-propanediol]], which is part of scientific research for many decades.

Another example of bioconversion is the [[Conversion (chemistry)|conversion]] of [[organic material]]s, such as plant or animal waste, into usable products or [[energy source]]s by biological processes or agents, such as certain [[microorganism]]s, some [[detritivore]]s or [[enzyme]]s.

In the USA, the Bioconversion Science and Technology group performs multidisciplinary R&amp;D for the [[United_States_Department_of_Energy|Department of Energy]]'s (DOE) relevant applications of bioprocessing, especially with biomass. Bioprocessing combines the disciplines of chemical engineering, microbiology and biochemistry. The Group 's primary role is investigation of the use of microorganism, microbial consortia and microbial enzymes in bioenergy research. New [[cellulosic ethanol]] conversion processes have enabled the variety and volume of [[feedstock]] that can be bioconverted to expand rapidly. Feedstock now includes materials derived from plant or animal waste such as paper, auto-fluff, tires, fabric, construction materials, [[municipal solid waste]] (MSW), [[sludge]], [[sewage]], etc.

==Three different processes for bioconversion==
1 -''' Enzymatic hydrolysis''' - a single source of feedstock, switchgrass for example, is mixed with strong enzymes which convert a portion of cellulosic material into sugars which can then be fermented into ethanol. [[Genencor]] and [[Novozymes]] are two companies that have received United States government Department of Energy funding for research into reducing the cost of cellulase, a key enzyme in the production cellulosic ethanol by this process.

2 - '''Synthesis gas fermentation''' - a blend of feedstock, not exceeding 30% water, is [[gasified]] in a closed environment into a [[syngas]] containing mostly carbon monoxide and hydrogen. The cooled syngas is then converted into usable products through exposure to bacteria or other catalysts. BRI Energy, LLC&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.brienergy.com/|title=Clean Technology for Renewable Energy|website=www.brienergy.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a company whose pilot plant in Fayetteville, Arkansas is currently using synthesis gas fermentation to convert a variety of waste into ethanol. After gasification, anaerobic bacteria  (''[[Clostridium ljungdahlii]]'') are used to convert the syngas ([[carbon monoxide|CO]], [[carbon dioxide|CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]], and [[hydrogen|H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]]) into ethanol. The heat generated by gasification is also used to co-generate excess electricity.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="30006">'''Choice modelling''' attempts to model the decision process of an individual or segment via [[revealed preference]]s or stated preferences made in a particular context or contexts. Typically, it attempts to use discrete choices (A over B; B over A, B &amp; C) in order to infer positions of the items (A, B and C) on some relevant latent scale (typically "[[utility]]" in economics and various related fields). Indeed many alternative models exist in [[econometrics]], [[marketing]], [[sociometrics]] and other fields, including [[utility]] maximization, [[optimization]] applied to [[consumer theory]], and a plethora of other identification strategies which may be more or less accurate depending on the [[data]], [[Sample (statistics)|sample]], [[hypothesis]] and the particular decision being modelled. In addition, choice modelling is regarded as the most suitable method for estimating consumers' [[willingness to pay]] for quality improvements in multiple dimensions.&lt;ref&gt;2001 - Centre for International Economics - Review of willingness-to-pay methodologies&lt;/ref&gt;

== Related terms ==
There are a number of terms which are considered to be synonyms with the term choice modelling. Some are accurate (although typically discipline or continent specific) and some are used in industry applications, although considered inaccurate in academia (such as conjoint analysis).&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

These include the following:

#[[#Stated preference|Stated preference discrete choice modeling]]
#[[Discrete choice]]
#[[Choice experiment]]
#Stated preference studies
#[[Conjoint analysis]]
#[[Controlled experiments]]
Although disagreements in terminology persist, it is notable that the academic journal intended to provide a cross-disciplinary source of new and empirical research into the field is called the Journal of Choice Modelling.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Journal of Choice Modelling|url = http://www.journals.elsevier.com/journal-of-choice-modelling/|website = Elsevier|accessdate = 2015-11-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Theoretical background ==
The theory behind choice modelling was developed independently by economists and mathematical psychologists. The origins of choice modelling can be traced to [[Louis Leon Thurstone|Thurstone's]] research into food preferences in the 1920s and to [[random utility theory]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://psycnet.apa.org/psycinfo/1928-00527-001|title=A law of comparative judgment.|last=Thurston|first=|date=1994|website=APA PsycNET|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|accessdate=2017-12-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; In economics, random utility theory was then developed by Daniel McFadden&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite book|title = Frontiers in Econometrics|last = Zarembka|first = Paul|publisher = Academic Press|year = 1974|isbn = |location = New York|pages = 105–142}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in mathematical psychology primarily by [[R. Duncan Luce|Duncan]] Luce and Anthony Marley.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Conditional logit analysis of qualitative choice behavior|last = Luce|first = R. Duncan|publisher = John Wiley &amp; Sons|year = 1959|isbn = |location = New York|pages = }}&lt;/ref&gt; In essence, choice modelling assumes that the utility (benefit, or value) that an individual derives from item A over item B is a function of the frequency that (s)he chooses item A over item B in repeated choices. Due to his use of the [[normal distribution]] Thurstone was unable to generalise this binary choice into a multinomial choice framework (which required the [[multinomial logistic regression]] rather than probit link function), hence why the method languished for over 30 years. However, in the 1960s through 1980s the method was axiomatised and applied in a variety of types of study.

== Distinction between revealed and stated preference studies ==
Choice modelling is used in both [[revealed preference]] (RP) and [[stated preference]] (SP) studies. RP studies use the choices made already by individuals to estimate the value they ascribe to items - they "reveal their preferences - and hence values (utilities) – by their choices". SP studies use the choices made by individuals made under experimental conditions to estimate these values – they "state their preferences via their choices". McFadden successfully used revealed preferences (made in previous transport studies) to predict the demand for the [[Bay Area Rapid Transit]] (BART) before it was built. Luce and Marley had previously axiomatised random utility theory but had not used it in a real world application;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Some probabilistic models of simple choice and ranking|url = http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0022249668900783|journal = Journal of Mathematical Psychology|date = 1968-06-01|pages = 311–332|volume = 5|issue = 2|doi = 10.1016/0022-2496(68)90078-3|first = A. A. J.|last = Marley}}&lt;/ref&gt; furthermore they spent many years testing the method in SP studies involving psychology students.

== History ==
McFadden's work earned him the [[Sveriges Riksbank Prize in Economic Sciences in Memory of Alfred Nobel]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/economics/laureates/2000/ Economics 2000&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; in 2000. However, much of the work in choice modelling had for almost 20 years been proceeding in the field of stated preferences.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Design and Analysis of Simulated Consumer Choice or Allocation Experiments: An Approach Based on Aggregate Data|jstor = 3151440|journal = Journal of Marketing Research|date = 1983-11-01|pages = 350–367|volume = 20|issue = 4|doi = 10.2307/3151440|first = Jordan J.|last = Louviere|first2 = George|last2 = Woodworth}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|title = DESIGN AND ANALYSIS OF SIMULATED CHOICE OR ALLOCATION EXPERIMENTS IN TRAVEL CHOICE MODELING|url = http://trid.trb.org/view.aspx?id=189334|journal = Transportation Research Record|date = 1982-01-01|issn = 0361-1981|issue = 890|first = Jordan J.|last = Louviere|first2 = David A.|last2 = Hensher}}&lt;/ref&gt; Such work arose in various disciplines, originally transport and marketing, due to the need to predict demand for new products that were potentially expensive to produce. This work drew heavily on the fields of [[conjoint analysis]] and [[design of experiments]], in order to:
# Present to consumers goods or services that were defined by particular features (attributes) that had levels, e.g. "price" with levels "$10, $20, $30"; "follow-up service" with levels "no warranty, 10 year warranty";
# Present configurations of these goods that minimised the number of choices needed in order to estimate the consumer's utility function (decision rule).
Specifically, the aim was to present the minimum number of pairs/triples etc of (for example) mobile/cell phones in order that the analyst might estimate the value the consumer derived (in monetary units) from every possible feature of a phone. In contrast to much of the work in conjoint analysis, discrete choices (A versus B; B versus A, B &amp; C) were to be made, rather than ratings on category rating scales ([[Likert scale]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;s). David Hensher and Jordan Louviere are widely credited with the first stated preference choice models.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; They remained pivotal figures, together with others including Joffre Swait and Moshe Ben-Akiva, and over the next three decades in the fields of transport and marketing helped develop and disseminate the methods.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite web|title = Stated Choice Methods|url = http://www.cambridge.org/gb/academic/subjects/economics/econometrics-statistics-and-mathematical-economics/stated-choice-methods-analysis-and-applications|website = Cambridge University Press|accessdate = 2015-11-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite web|title = Discrete Choice Analysis|url = https://mitpress.mit.edu/books/discrete-choice-analysis|website = MIT Press|accessdate = 2015-11-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, many other figures, predominantly working in transport economics and marketing, contributed to theory and practice and helped disseminate the work widely.

== Relationship with conjoint analysis ==
Choice modelling from the outset suffered from a lack of standardisation of terminology and all the terms given above have been used to describe it. However, the largest disagreement has proved to be geographical: in the Americas, following industry practice there, the term "choice-based conjoint analysis" has come to dominate.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Survey Software &amp; Conjoint Analysis - What is Conjoint Analysis?|url = http://www.sawtoothsoftware.com/products/conjoint-choice-analysis/conjoint-analysis-software|website = www.sawtoothsoftware.com|accessdate = 2015-11-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; This reflected a desire that choice modelling (1) reflect the attribute and level structure inherited from conjoint analysis, but (2) show that discrete choices, rather than numerical ratings, be used as the outcome measure elicited from consumers. Elsewhere in the world, the term discrete choice experiment has come to dominate in virtually all disciplines.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Louviere (marketing and transport) and colleagues in environmental and health economics came to disavow the American terminology, claiming that it was misleading and disguised a fundamental difference discrete choice experiments have from traditional conjoint methods: discrete choice experiments have a testable theory of human decision-making underpinning them (random utility theory), whilst conjoint methods are simply a way of decomposing the value of a good using ''statistical'' designs from numerical ratings that have no ''psychological'' theory to explain what the rating scale numbers mean.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Discrete Choice Experiments Are Not Conjoint Analysis|url = http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1755534513700149|journal = Journal of Choice Modelling|date = 2010-01-01|pages = 57–72|volume = 3|issue = 3|doi = 10.1016/S1755-5345(13)70014-9|first = Jordan J|last = Louviere|first2 = Terry N|last2 = Flynn|first3 = Richard T|last3 = Carson}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Designing a choice model ==
Designing a choice model or discrete choice experiment (DCE) generally follows the following steps:
# Identifying the good or service to be valued;
# Deciding on what attributes and levels fully describe the good or service;
# Constructing an [[Experimental design]] that is appropriate for those attributes and levels, either from a design catalogue,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Orthogonal Arrays|url = https://support.sas.com/techsup/technote/ts723.html|website = support.sas.com|accessdate = 2015-11-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; or via a software program;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = ChoiceMetrics {{!}} Ngene {{!}} Features|url = http://www.choice-metrics.com/features.html|website = www.choice-metrics.com|accessdate = 2015-11-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;
# Constructing the survey, replacing the design codes (numbers) with the relevant attribute levels;
# Administering the survey to a sample of respondents in any of a number of formats including paper and pen, but increasingly via web surveys;
# Analysing the data using appropriate models, often beginning with the [[Multinomial logistic regression]] model, given its attractive properties in terms of consistency with economic demand theory.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

=== Identifying the good or service to be valued ===
This is often the easiest task, typically defined by:
* the research question in an academic study, or
* the needs of the client (in the context of a consumer good or service)

=== Deciding on what attributes and levels fully describe the good or service ===
A good or service, for instance mobile (cell) phone, is typically described by a number of attributes (features). Phones are often described by shape, size, memory, brand, etc. The attributes to be varied in the DCE must be all those that are of interest to respondents. Omitting key attributes typically causes respondents to make inferences (guesses) about those missing from the DCE, leading to omitted variable problems. The levels must typically include all those currently available, and often are expanded to include those that are possible in future – this is particularly useful in guiding product development.

=== Constructing an experimental design that is appropriate for those attributes and levels, either from a design catalogue, or via a software program ===
A strength of DCEs and conjoint analyses is that they typically present a subset of the full factorial. For example, a phone with two brands, three shapes, three sizes and four amounts of memory has 2x3x3x4=72 possible configurations. This is the full factorial and in most cases is too large to administer to respondents. Subsets of the full factorial can be produced in a variety of ways but in general they have the following aim: to enable estimation of a certain limited number of parameters describing the good: main effects (for example the value associated with brand, holding all else equal), two-way interactions (for example the value associated with this brand and the smallest size, that brand and the smallest size), etc. This is typically achieved by deliberately confounding higher order interactions with lower order interactions. For example, two-way and three-way interactions may be confounded with main effects. This has the following consequences:
* The number of profiles (configurations) is significantly reduced;
* A regression coefficient for a given main effect is unbiased if and only if the confounded terms (higher order interactions) are zero;
* A regression coefficient is biased in an unknown direction and with an unknown magnitude if the confounded interaction terms are non-zero;
* No correction can be made at the analysis to solve the problem, should the confounded terms be non-zero.
Thus, researchers have repeatedly been warned that design involves critical decisions to be made concerning whether two-way and higher order interactions are likely to be non-zero; making a mistake at the design stage effectively invalidates the results since the hypothesis of higher order interactions being non-zero is untestable.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

Designs are available from catalogues and statistical programs. Traditionally they had the property of [[Orthogonality]] where all attribute levels can be estimated independently of each other. This ensures zero collinearity and can be explained using the following example.

Imagine a car dealership that sells both luxury cars and used low-end vehicles. Using the utility maximisation principle and assuming an MNL model, we hypothesise that the decision to buy a car from this dealership is the sum of the individual contribution of each of the following to the total utility.
* Price
* Marque (BMW, Chrysler, Mitsubishi)
* Origin (German, American)
* Performance

Using multinomial regression on the sales data however will not tell us what we want to know. The reason is that much of the data is collinear since cars at this dealership are either:

* high performance, expensive German cars
* low performance, cheap American cars

There is not enough information, nor will there ever be enough, to tell us whether people are buying cars because they are European, because they are a BMW or because they are high performance. This is a fundamental reason why RP data are often unsuitable and why SP data are required. In RP data these three attributes always co-occur and in this case are perfectly [[correlated]]. That is: all BMWs are made in Germany and are of high performance. These three attributes: origin, marque and performance are said to be collinear or non-orthogonal. Only in experimental conditions, via SP data, can performance and price be varied independently – have their effects decomposed.

An [[experimental design]] (below) in a Choice Experiment is a strict scheme for controlling and presenting hypothetical scenarios, or [[choice set]]s to respondents. For the same experiment, different designs could be used, each with different properties. The best design depends on the objectives of the exercise.

It is the experimental design that drives the experiment and the ultimate capabilities of the model. Many very efficient designs exist in the public domain that allow near optimal experiments to be performed.

For example the [[Latin square]] 16&lt;sup&gt;17&lt;/sup&gt; design allows the estimation of all main effects of a product that could have up to 16&lt;sup&gt;17&lt;/sup&gt; (approximately 295 followed by eighteen zeros) configurations. Furthermore this could be achieved within a sample frame of only around 256 respondents.

Below is an example of a much smaller design. This is 3&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt; main effects design.

This design would allow the estimation of main effects utilities from 81 (3&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;) possible product configurations ''assuming all higher order interactions are zero''. A sample of around 20 respondents could model the main effects of all 81 possible product configurations with statistically significant results.

Some examples of other experimental designs commonly used:

*Balanced incomplete block designs (BIBD)
*Random designs
*Main effects
*Higher order interaction designs
*Full factorial

More recently, efficient designs have been produced.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Constructing Efficient Stated Choice Experimental Designs|url = https://dx.doi.org/10.1080/01441640902827623|journal = Transport Reviews|date = 2009-09-01|issn = 0144-1647|pages = 587–617|volume = 29|issue = 5|doi = 10.1080/01441640902827623|first = John M.|last = Rose|first2 = Michiel C.

A common function is the [[D-efficiency]] of the parameters. The aim of these designs is to reduce the sample size required to achieve statistical significance of the estimated utility parameters. Such designs have often incorporated Bayesian priors for the parameters, to further improve statistical precision.&lt;ref&gt;[Rossi, P., Allenby, G., McCulloch, R. (2009) Bayesian statistic and marketing. Wiley]&lt;/ref&gt; Highly efficient designs have become extremely popular, given the costs of recruiting larger numbers of respondents. However, key figures in the development of these designs have warned of possible limitations, most notably the following.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; Design efficiency is typically maximised when good A and good B are as different as possible: for instance every attribute (feature) defining the phone differs across A and B. This forces the respondent to trade across price, brand, size, memory, etc; no attribute has the same level in both A and B. This may impose cognitive burden on the respondent, leading him/her to use simplifying heuristics ("always choose the cheapest phone") that do not reflect his/her true utility function (decision rule). Recent empirical work has confirmed that respondents do indeed have different decision rules when answering a less efficient design compared to a highly efficient design.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = Are Efficient Designs Used In Discrete Choice Experiments Too Difficult For Some Respondents? A Case Study Eliciting Preferences for End-Of-Life Care|last = Flynn|first = Terry N|date = March 2016|journal = Pharmacoeconomics|doi = 10.1007/s40273-015-0338-z |pmid = 26589411 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

More information on experimental designs may be found [[experimental design|here]]. It is worth reiterating, however, that small designs that estimate main effects typically do so by deliberately confounding higher order interactions with the main effects. This means that unless those interactions are zero in practice, the analyst will obtain biased estimates of the main effects. Furthermore (s)he has (1) no way of testing this, and (2) no way of correcting it in analysis. This emphasises the crucial role of design in DCEs.

=== Constructing the survey ===
Constructing the survey typically involves:
* Doing a "find and replace" in order that the experimental design codes (typically numbers as given in the example above) are replaced by the attribute levels of the good in question.
* Putting the resulting configurations (for instance types of mobile/cell phones) into a broader survey than may include questions pertaining to sociodemographics of the respondents. This may aid in segmenting the data at the analysis stage: for example males may differ from females in their preferences.

=== Administering the survey to a sample of respondents in any of a number of formats including paper and pen, but increasingly via web surveys ===
Traditionally, DCEs were administered via paper and pen methods. Increasingly, with the power of the web, internet surveys have become the norm. These have advantages in terms of cost, randomising respondents to different versions of the survey, and using screening. An example of the latter would be to achieve balance in gender: if too many males answered, they can be screened out in order that the number of females matches that of males.

=== Analysing the data using appropriate models, often beginning with the [[multinomial logistic regression]] model, given its attractive properties in terms of consistency with economic demand theory ===
Analysing the data from a DCE requires the analyst to assume a particular type of decision rule - or functional form of the utility equation in economists' terms. This is usually dictated by the design: if a main effects design has been used then two-way and higher order interaction terms cannot be included in the model. Regression models are then typically estimated. These often begin with the conditional logit model - traditionally, although slightly misleadingly, referred to as the multinomial logistic (MNL) regression model by choice modellers. The MNL model converts the observed choice frequencies (being estimated probabilities, on a ratio scale) into utility estimates (on an interval scale) via the logistic function. The utility (value) associated with every attribute level can be estimated, thus allowing the analyst to construct the total utility of any possible configuration (in this case, of car or phone). However, a DCE may alternatively be used to estimate non-market environmental benefits and costs.&lt;ref&gt;Jeff Bennet University of Queensland https://www.epa.qld.gov.au/publications?id=1585&lt;/ref&gt;

== Strengths==
* Forces respondents to consider trade-offs between attributes;
* Makes the frame of reference explicit to respondents via the inclusion of an array of attributes and product alternatives;
* Enables implicit prices to be estimated for attributes;
* Enables welfare impacts to be estimated for multiple scenarios;
* Can be used to estimate the level of customer demand for alternative 'service product' in non-monetary terms; and
* Potentially reduces the incentive for respondents to behave strategically.&lt;ref&gt;2001 – The Centre for International Economics – review of
willingness-to-pay methodologies&lt;/ref&gt;

== Weaknesses ==
* Discrete choices provide only [[ordinal data]], which provides less information than ratio or interval data;
* Inferences from ordinal data, to produce estimates on an interval/ratio scale, require assumptions about error distributions and the respondent's decision rule (functional form of the utility function);
* Fractional factorial designs used in practice deliberately confound two-way and higher order interactions with lower order (typically main effects) estimates in order to make the design small: if the higher order interactions are non-zero then main effects are biased, with no way for the analyst to know or correct this ex post;
* Non-probabilistic (deterministic) decision-making by the individual violates random utility theory: under a random utility model, utility estimates become infinite.
* There is one fundamental weakness of all limited dependent variable models such as logit and probit models: the means (true positions) and variances on the latent scale are perfectly [[Confounded]]. In other words they cannot be separated.

== The mean-variance confound ==
Yatchew and Griliches first proved that means and variances were confounded in limited dependent variable models (where the dependent variable takes any of a discrete set of values rather than a [[continuous variable|continuous]] one as in conventional linear regression).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Specification Error in Probit Models|url = https://www.researchgate.net/publication/24094302_Specification_Error_in_Probit_Models|journal = The Review of Economics and Statistics|volume = 67|issue = 1|doi = 10.2307/1928444|first = Adonis|last = Yatchew|first2 = Zvi|last2 = Griliches}}&lt;/ref&gt; This limitation becomes acute in choice modelling for the following reason: a large estimated beta from the MNL regression model or any other choice model can mean:
# Respondents place the item high up on the latent scale (they value it highly), or
# Respondents do not place the item high up on the scale BUT they are very certain of their preferences, consistently (frequently) choosing the item over others presented alongside, or
# Some combination of (1) and (2).
This has significant implications for the interpretation of the output of a regression model. All statistical programs "solve" the mean-variance confound by setting the variance equal to a constant; all estimated beta coefficients are, in fact, an estimated beta multiplied by an estimated lamda (an inverse function of the variance). This tempts the analyst to ignore the problem. However (s)he must consider whether a set of large beta coefficients reflect strong preferences (a large true beta) or consistency in choices (a large true lamda), or some combination of the two. Dividing all estimates by one other – typically that of the price variable – cancels the confounded lamda term from numerator and denominator.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Combining sources of preference data |journal = Journal of Econometrics|date = 1998-11-26|pages = 197–221|volume = 89|issue = 1–2|doi = 10.1016/S0304-4076(98)00061-X|first = David|last = Hensher|first2 = Jordan|last2 = Louviere|first3 = Joffre|last3 = Swait}}&lt;/ref&gt; This solves the problem, with the added benefit that it provides economists with the respondent's willingness to pay for each attribute level. However, the finding that results estimated in "utility space" do not match those estimated in "willingness to pay space",&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Applications of simulation methods in environmental and resource economics|last = Train|first = Kenneth|publisher = Doredrecht|year = 2005|isbn = |location = |pages = 1–16}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Heterogeneity Distributions of Willingness-to-Pay in Choice Models|url = https://www.researchgate.net/publication/5155835_Heterogeneity_distributions_of_willingness-to-pay_in_choice_models|journal = |doi = 10.2139/ssrn.928412|first = Garrett|last = Sonnier|first2 = Andrew S.|last2 = Ainslie|first3 = Thomas|last3 = Otter}}&lt;/ref&gt; suggests that the confound problem is not solved by this "trick": variances may be attribute specific or some other function of the variables (which would explain the discrepancy). This is a subject of current research in the field.

== Versus traditional ratings-based conjoint methods ==
Major problems with ratings questions that do not occur with choice models are:
*no trade-off information. A risk with ratings is that respondents tend not to differentiate between perceived 'good' attributes and rate them all as attractive.
*variant personal scales. Different individuals value a '2' on a scale of 1 to 5 differently. Aggregation of the frequencies of each of the scale measures has no theoretical basis.
*no relative measure. How does an analyst compare something rated a 1 to something rated a 2? Is one twice as good as the other? Again there is no theoretical way of aggregating the data.

== Other types ==

=== Ranking ===
Rankings do tend to force the individual to indicate relative preferences for the items of interest. Thus the trade-offs between these can, like in a DCE, typically be estimated. However, ranking models must test whether the same utility function is being estimated at every ranking depth: e.g. the same estimates (up to variance scale) must result from the bottom rank data as from the top rank data.

=== Best–worst scaling ===
[[Best–worst scaling]] (BWS) is a well-regarded alternative to ratings and ranking. It asks people to choose their most and least preferred options from a range of alternatives.  By subtracting or integrating across the choice probabilities, utility scores for each alternative can be estimated on an interval or ratio scale, for individuals and/or groups. Various psychological models may be utilised by individuals to produce best-worst data, including the [[MaxDiff]] model.

== Uses ==

Choice modelling is particularly useful for:

*Predicting uptake and refining [[new product development]]
*Estimating the implied willingness to pay (WTP) for goods and services
*Product or service viability testing
*Estimating the effects of product characteristics on consumer choice
*Variations of product attributes
*Understanding brand value and preference
*Demand estimates and optimum pricing

A '''compost heater''' (or '''Biomeiler''') is a structure for the energetic use of [[biomass]] for the heating of [[building]]s.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.greenbuilt.org/bks-compost-water-heater/ Green Built Alliance - Compost Water Heater]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.prepperfortress.com/alternative-heat-compost-heater-permaculture/ Prepper Fortress - Alternative Heat — Compost Heater – Permaculture]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://native-power.de/en/native-power/biomeiler Biomeiler]&lt;/ref&gt;

The method was developed by [[Jean Pain]] in the 1970s. Compost heaters are used primarily for demonstration purposes as small systems for heating a house. Local waste can be converted to energy.

==Types==
[[File:BiomeilerDrawing.jpg|thumb|200px|Using the heat of an external compost heap for warming up the inside of a house]]
===Compost heap===
The traditional compost heater exploits the heat of a large compost heap to warm a house. This type requires a big heap, intertwined with a spiral water hose. The circulating water conducts heat to the building, where it can be fed to a heating circuit.

The heap must contain at least 8,000 liters of biomass to maintain a temperature during the winter.

For this purpose, chipped [[wood]] is usually piled up and a water hose is passed through it. A [[microbiological]] degradation process generates heat for up to 24 months. The heat produces hot water, which is then fed to a heating circuit. With sufficient oxygen supply, the biomass is degraded by [[Decomposition|aerobic decomposition]]. The activity of the microorganisms can be regulated by the [[moisture]] content.

===Hot water and biogas===
[[File:JeanPainSystem.jpg|thumb|300px|left|The heat of a compost heap is used, and biogas is produced at the same time.]]
Pain's 'Biomeiler' combines composting with [[biogas]].

The raw materials of Pain's compost heap were saplings, branches and underbrush. He  developed the machines that grind these materials to the proper size. One of his machines, a tractor-driven model, earned fourth prize in the 1978 [[Grenoble]] Agricultural Fair.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.permacultureactivist.net/PeterBane/Jean_Pain.html Another Kind of Energy or ComPost-Modernism] - By Peter Bane.&lt;/ref&gt; After Pain had ground the raw materials, Pain would construct a heap three metres high and six metres across (10 × 20 feet).&lt;ref&gt;{{YouTube|JHRvwNJRNag|The Jean Pain Method (in English)}}&lt;/ref&gt; The heap weighed approximately  {{convert|50|t}}, and was mounted over a {{convert|4|m3}} steel tank. This tank was 3/4 full of compost, which had first been steeped in water for two months. The hermetically sealed tank was connected by tubing to 24 truck tire inner tubes, gathered nearby to collect the [[methane]] gas. The gas was distilled by washing and compressing it through small stones in water. Pain used the gas for cooking and producing electricity. He also fueled a light van. Pain estimated that {{convert|10|kg|lb|abbr=off}} of brushwood would supply the gas equivalent of {{convert|1|L|spell=in}}. of [[petrol]].

It took about 90 days to produce {{convert|500|m3}} of gas - enough to keep two ovens and three burner stoves going for a year. The methane-fueled combustion engine drove a generator that produced 100 watts of electricity.  This charged a battery, providing the light needed. Skepticism has been leveled at Pain's estimates for methane extraction&lt;ref&gt;[[Appropedia:Talk:Jean Pain system|Talk page on the Appropedia project: Jean Pain System]]&lt;/ref&gt; and it is not known if anyone has been able to reproduce his results.

Pain's compost heaps generated hot water via {{convert|200|m|0}} of pipe buried inside the compost mound. The pipe was wrapped around the methane generator with an inlet for cold water and an outlet for hot water. The heat from the decomposing mass produced {{convert|4|L/min}} of hot water heated to {{convert|60|C|F|abbr=off}} — enough to meet central heating, bathroom and kitchen requirements. The heap composted for nearly 18 months, after which it was dismantled. The [[humus]] was used to [[mulch]] soils. 

===Heater silo===
[[File:CompostHeaterSiloConcept.jpg|thumb|160px|Using the heat of a compost heater silo for warming up the inside of a house]]
The composting process runs in an airtight container inside a house. The heat can be radiated directly to the interiors of the house or distributed by a heating circuit. An additional water pipe can be vertically built into the silo for warming water.

The silo is the central part of an in-house compost heater. In autumn the silo is filled up with fresh [[biomass]], after which the silo delivers comfortable heat throughout the winter.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.appropedia.org/Compost_heater_silo The Compost Heater Silo project]&lt;/ref&gt;

Inlet air and outlet air provide the necessary [[oxygen]]. The outlet air goes out of the house. Silo moisture is higher than in a regular compost heap. The decay process produces additional water, which is drained at the bottom of the silo. A part of this water enters the top of the silo for better distribution in the processing volume. If pumped periodically or continuously to the top to rinse through the silo, the whole system becomes a ''wet composting'' system.

{{Tort law}}
'''Contributory negligence''' in [[common law]] jurisdictions is generally a [[defense (legal)|defense]] to a claim based on negligence, an action in [[tort]]. This principle is relevant to the determination of liability and is applicable when  [[plaintiffs]]/[[claimants]] have, through their own negligence, contributed to the harm they suffered.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Contributory Negligence|url=https://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/contributory_negligence|website=Wex|publisher=Cornell Law School|accessdate=28 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In some jurisdictions it may be applied by the court in a tort matter irrespective of whether it was pleaded as a defense.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Douglas v. Harris, 35 N.J. 270, 281, 173 A.2d 1 (1961)|url=https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=16113360978766983305|website=Google Scholar|publisher=Google|accessdate=28 June 2017}} "[T]he rule requiring a defendant to so affirmatively plead [contributory negligence] is mandatory. However, the court may relax that rule when its enforcement would be inconsistent with substantial justice."&lt;/ref&gt;

The contributory negligence defense can potentially eliminate the defendant's responsibility to pay damages to an injured plaintiff. For example, a [[pedestrian]] crosses a road negligently and is hit by a driver who was driving negligently. Since the pedestrian has also contributed to the accident, they may be barred from complete and full recovery of damages from the driver (or their insurer) because the accident was less likely to occur if it hadn't been for their failure to keep a proper lookout.  Another example of contributory negligence is where a plaintiff actively  disregards warnings or fails to take reasonable steps for his or her safety, then [[Assumption of risk|assumes a certain level of risk]] in a given activity; such as diving in shallow water without checking the depth first.

== History ==
The doctrine of contributory negligence was dominant in U.S. [[jurisprudence]] in the 19th and 20th century.&lt;ref name=Little2007/&gt; The English case [[Butterfield v. Forrester]] is generally recognized as the first appearance, although in this case the judge found the victim to be the sole [[proximate cause]] of the injury.&lt;ref name=Little2007/&gt;

==Burden of proof==
In some jurisdictions, in order to successfully raise an contributory negligence defense, the defendant must prove the [[negligence]] of a plaintiff or claimant. In others, the burden of proof is on a plaintiff to disprove his or her own negligence.

Even if the plaintiff was negligent, the [[tortfeasor]] may still be held liable if he or she had the [[last clear chance]] to prevent the injury, meaning that even though the plaintiff was negligent the defendant was the last person with a clear opportunity to take action that would have prevented the plaintiff's injury from occurring.

==Availability==
Contributory negligence is generally a defense to a tort of negligence. The defense is not available if the [[tortfeasor]]'s conduct amounts to malicious or intentional wrongdoing, rather than to ordinary negligence.

In some jurisdictions, the doctrine states that a victim who is at fault to any degree, including only 1% at fault, may be denied compensation entirely. This is known as pure contributory negligence.&lt;ref name=Little2007&gt;Little WBL. (2007). [http://law.campbell.edu/lawreview/articles/30-1-81.pdf "It is Much Easier to Find Fault With Others, Than to be Faultless Ourselves": Contributory Negligence as a Bar to a Claim for Breach of the Implied Warranty of Merchantability]. ''Campbell Law Review''.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Australia===
In Australia, particularly New South Wales, the award of damages is reduced by the same percentage as the plaintiff's own negligence.&lt;ref&gt;''Civil Liability Act 2002 (NSW), Part 1A, Division 8,'' see also {{cite Legislation AU|NSW|act|lrpa1965404|Law Reform Miscellaneous Act 1965|9}}(1)(b).&lt;/ref&gt; For example, if the plaintiff was 50% negligent in causing his or her own accident, but would otherwise be entitled to $100,000 in damages, a court will award only $50,000. A court may also find that 100% contributory negligence is applicable in which case the plaintiff is not entitled to any damages.&lt;ref&gt;Civil Liability Act 2002 (NSW), section 5S&lt;/ref&gt; Determining the extent of the contributory negligence is subjective and heavily dependent on the evidence available. Parties will often work to negotiate a mutually satisfactory percentage figure when engaging in [[alternative dispute resolution]] (such as mediation). If the matter does not settle, a percentage figure is ultimately assigned by the court at the hearing.

In Australia, contributory negligence is available when the plaintiff's own negligence contributed to its own injuries.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lexisnexis.com/au/legal/results/enhdocview.do?docLinkInd=true&amp;ersKey=23_T18782872968&amp;format=GNBFULL&amp;startDocNo=0&amp;resultsUrlKey=0_T18782872970&amp;backKey=20_T18782872971&amp;csi=267716&amp;docNo=1&amp;scrollToPosition=0 Froom v Butcher [1976&lt;nowiki&gt;]&lt;/nowiki&gt; 1 QB 286]&lt;/ref&gt; Also refer to ''Pennington v Norris'' for second test.&lt;ref name="Pennington v Norris"&gt;{{cite AustLII|HCA|26|1956|litigants=Pennington v Norris |parallelcite=(1956) 96 [[Commonwealth Law Reports|CLR]] 10 |courtname=[[High Court of Australia|High Court]] |date=6 June 1956}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

===United States===
In the United States, the pure contributory negligence only applies in Alabama, Maryland, North Carolina, and Virginia. Indiana applies pure contributory negligence to medical malpractice cases and tort claims against governmental entities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Swisher|first1=Peter N.|title=Virginia Should Abolish the Archaic Tort Defense of Contributory Negligence and Adopt a Comparative Negligence Defense in Its Place|journal=University of Richmond Law Review|date=2011|volume=46|page=359|url=http://heinonline.org/HOL/LandingPage?handle=hein.journals/urich46&amp;div=16&amp;id=&amp;page=|accessdate=6 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the other 45 states in the U.S., plaintiff's recovery is simply diminished by the extent to which he or she contributed to the harm under principles of [[comparative negligence]], with some states using a mixed model of comparative and contributory negligence. A state with a mixed model may, for example, prevent a plaintiff from recovering damages if the plaintiff is determined to bear more than 50% of the responsibility for his or her own injury.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Larson|first1=Aaron|title=Negligence and Tort Law|url=https://www.expertlaw.com/library/personal_injury/negligence.html|website=ExpertLaw|accessdate=6 September 2017|date=21 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===United Kingdom===
In England and Wales, it is not possible to defeat a claim under contributory negligence and therefore completely deny the victim compensation. It does however allow for a reduction in damages recoverable to the extent that the court sees fit.&lt;ref name=Act_1945&gt;. [http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/Geo6/8-9/28 "Law Reform (Contributory Negligence) Act 1945"].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Contributory negligence|url=https://uk.practicallaw.thomsonreuters.com/3-107-6337?transitionType=Default&amp;contextData=(sc.Default)&amp;firstPage=true&amp;bhcp=1|website=Practical Law|publisher=Thomson Reuters|accessdate=28 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[England and Wales]], it is not a defense to the tort of [[Conversion (law)|conversion]] or [[trespass to chattels]]. In the United States, it is not a defense to any intentional tort.  

===India===
In [[India]] compensation in favour of victim gets reduced in proportion with his negligence.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="44067">'''Critical race theory''' ('''CRT'''){{sfn|Delgado Bernal|2002}} is a theoretical framework in the [[social science]]s that uses [[critical theory]] to examine society and culture as they relate to  [[Race (human categorization)|categorizations of race]], [[law]], and [[power (social and political)|power]].{{sfn|Yosso|2005}}&lt;ref name="habermas.org"&gt;{{cite journal | url=http://www.habermas.org/critraceth01bk.htm | author=Lewis R. Gordon | title=A Short History of the 'Critical' in Critical Race Theory | journal=American Philosophy Association Newsletter | volume=98 | issue=2 | date=Spring 1999 | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120301005859/http://www.habermas.org/critraceth01bk.htm | archivedate=March 1, 2012 | df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; It began as a theoretical movement within American law schools in the mid- to late 1980s as a reworking of [[critical legal studies]] on race issues{{sfn|Cole|2007}}&lt;ref&gt;"Critical Race Theory thus represents an attempt to inhabit and expand the space between two very different intellectual and ideological formations…" Civil Rights reform and Critical Legal Studies. "Introduction". In {{harvnb|Crenshaw|Gotanda|Peller|Thomas|1995|p=19}}.&lt;/ref&gt; and is loosely unified by two common themes:  First, CRT proposes that [[White supremacy#Academic use of the term|white supremacy]] and racial power are maintained over time, and in particular, that the law may play a role in this process.  Second, CRT work has investigated the possibility of transforming the relationship between law and racial power, and more broadly, pursues a project of achieving racial emancipation and anti-subordination.&lt;ref&gt;"Introduction". In {{harvnb|Crenshaw|Gotanda|Peller|Thomas|1995}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Scholars important to the theory include [[Derrick Bell]],  [[Patricia Williams]], [[Kimberlé Williams Crenshaw]], and [[Mari Matsuda]]. By 2002, over 20 American law schools and at least three law schools in other countries offered critical race theory courses or classes which covered the issue centrally.{{sfn|Harris|2002}} Critical race theory is taught and innovated in the fields of education, [[political science]], [[women's studies]], [[ethnic studies]], communication, and [[American studies]].{{sfn|Delgado|Stefancic|2012|pp=6–7}}

Critics of CRT, including [[Richard Posner]] and [[Alex Kozinski]], take issue with its foundations in [[postmodernism]] and reliance on moral relativism, social constructionism, and other tenets contrary to [[Classical liberalism|classical liberalism]].

==Definition==
According to the [[UCLA Luskin School of Public Affairs|UCLA School of Public Affairs]]:
&lt;blockquote&gt;CRT recognizes that racism is engrained in the fabric and system of the American society. The individual racist need not exist to note that institutional racism is pervasive in the dominant culture. This is the analytical lens that CRT uses in examining existing power structures. CRT identifies that these power structures are based on white privilege and white supremacy, which perpetuates the marginalization of people of color.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://spacrs.wordpress.com/what-is-critical-race-theory/ |title=What Is Critical Race Theory? |accessdate=11 March 2012 |publisher=[[UCLA School of Public Affairs]]|date=2009-11-04 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Legal scholar Roy L. Brooks has defined CRT as "a collection of critical stances against the existing legal order from a race-based point of view", and says

&lt;blockquote&gt;it focuses on the various ways in which the received tradition in law adversely affects people of color not as individuals but as a group. Thus, CRT attempts to analyze law and legal traditions through the history, contemporary experiences, and racial sensibilities of racial minorities in this country. The question always lurking in the background of CRT is this: What would the legal landscape look like today if people of color were the decision-makers?{{sfn|Brooks|1994|p=85}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Origins==
Kimberlé Crenshaw, Neil T. Gotanda, Gary Peller, and Kendall Thomas argue that two events were vital to the emergence of CRT: the 1981 Alternative Course on race at Harvard Law School, taught with Derrick Bell, and the 1987 Critical Legal Studies Conference on silence and race.{{sfn|Crenshaw|Gotanda|Peller|Thomas|1995|pp=xix-xxvii}}

==Key elements==
Critical race theory draws on the priorities and perspectives of both [[critical legal studies]] and conventional civil rights scholarship, while sharply contesting both of these fields. [[Angela P. Harris]] describes CRT as sharing "a commitment to a vision of liberation from racism through right reason" with the civil rights tradition.{{sfn|Harris|1994|pp=741–743}} It [[deconstruction|deconstructs]] some premises and arguments of [[legal theory]] and simultaneously holds that legally constructed rights are incredibly important.{{sfnm |1a1=Crenshaw |1a2=Gotanda |1a3=Peller |1a4=Thomas |1y=1995 |1p=xxiv |1ps=: "To the emerging race crits, rights discourse held a social and transformative value in the context of racial subordination that transcended the narrower question of whether reliance on rights alone could bring about any determinate results" |2a1=Harris |2y=1994}}{{page needed|date=September 2016}} In Angela P. Harris' view, as described by [[Derrick Bell]], critical race theory is committed to "radical critique of the law (which is normatively deconstructionist) and ... radical emancipation by the law (which is normatively reconstructionist)."{{sfn|Bell|1995|p=899}}

CRT's theoretical elements are provided by a variety of sources.

[[Richard Delgado]] and Jean Stefancic have documented the following major themes as characteristic of work in critical race theory:
* A critique of [[liberalism]]: CRT scholars favor a more aggressive approach to social transformation as opposed to liberalism's more cautious approach, favor a [[Race (human categorization)|race]]-conscious approach to transformation rather than liberalism's embrace of [[color blindness (race)|color blindness]], and favor an approach that relies more on political organizing, in contrast to liberalism's reliance on rights-based remedies.{{sfn|Delgado|Stefancic|1993}}
* [[Storytelling]]/counterstorytelling and "naming one's own reality"—using narrative to illuminate and explore experiences of racial oppression.{{sfn|Delgado|Stefancic|1993}} Bryan Brayboy has emphasized the [[Epistemology|epistemic]] importance of storytelling in [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Indigenous American]] communities as superseding that of theory, and has proposed a Tribal Critical Race Theory (TribCrit).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Brayboy|first=Bryan McKinley Jones|date=2005-12|title=Toward a Tribal Critical Race Theory in Education|journal=The Urban Review|language=en|volume=37|issue=5|pages=425–446|doi=10.1007/s11256-005-0018-y|issn=0042-0972}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Historical revisionism|Revisionist]] interpretations of American [[civil rights]] [[law]] and progress—criticizing civil rights scholarship and anti-discrimination law.  An example is ''[[Brown v. Board of Education]]''. Derrick Bell, one of CRT's founders, argued that civil rights advances for blacks coincided with the self-interest of white elitists.  Mary Dudziak performed extensive archival research in the US Department of State and US Department of Justice, as well as the correspondence by US ambassadors abroad.  She found that passing of the laws in the US was not because people of color were discriminated against, rather it was to improve the image of the US to Third World countries that the US needed as allies during the [[Cold War]].{{sfnm |1a1=Delgado |1a2=Stefancic |1y=1993 |2a1=Delgado |2a2=Stefancic |2y=2012 |2pp=18–21 |3a1=Dudziak |3y=1993}}
* Applying insights from social science writing on race and [[racism]] to legal problems.{{sfn|Delgado|Stefancic|1993}}
* The [[intersectionality|intersections]] theory is the examination of race, sex, class, national origin, and sexual orientation, and how their combination plays out in various settings, e.g., how the needs of a Latina female are different from those of a black male and whose needs are the ones promoted.{{sfnm |1a1=Delgado |1a2=Stefancic |1y=1993 |2a1=Delgado |2a2=Stefancic |2y=2012 |2pp=51–55}}
* [[Essentialism]] philosophy—reducing the experience of a category (gender or race) to the experience of one sub-group (white women or African-Americans). Basically, all oppressed people share the commonality of oppression.  However, that oppression varies by gender, class, race, etc., so the aims and strategies will differ for each of these groups.{{sfnm |1a1=Delgado |1a2=Stefancic |1y=1993 |2a1=Delgado |2a2=Stefancic |2y=2012 |2pp=56–57}}
* Non-white cultural [[nationalism]]/[[separatism]], [[Black nationalism]]—exploring more radical views arguing for separation and reparations as a form of foreign aid.{{sfn|Delgado|Stefancic|1993}}
* Legal institutions, [[critical pedagogy]], and minority lawyers in the bar.{{sfn|Delgado|Stefancic|1993}}
* The concept of structural determinism, or how "the structure of legal thought or culture influences its content," is a mode of thought or widely shared practice which determines significant social outcomes. Usually this occurs without conscious knowledge and because of this, our system cannot redress certain kinds of wrongs.{{sfnm |1a1=Delgado |1a2=Stefancic |1y=1993 |2a1=Delgado |2a2=Stefancic |2y=2012 |2pp=26, 155}}
*[[White privilege]] refers to the myriad of social advantages, benefits, and courtesies that come with being a member of the dominant race, such as a clerk not following you around in a store or not having people cross the street at night to avoid you.{{sfn|Delgado|Stefancic|2012|pp=78–80}}
*[[Microaggression]] refers to the sudden, stunning, or dispiriting transactions that mar the days of oppressed individuals.  These include small acts of racism consciously or unconsciously perpetrated and act like water dripping on a rock wearing away at it slowly.  Microaggressions are based on the assumptions about racial matters that are absorbed from cultural heritage.{{sfn|Delgado|Stefancic|2012|pp=1–2}}
*Empathetic fallacy is the belief that one can change a narrative by offering an alternative narrative in hopes that the listener's empathy will quickly and reliably take over.  Empathy is not enough to change racism as most people are not exposed to many people different from themselves and people mostly seek out information about their own culture and group.{{sfn|Delgado|Stefancic|2012|pp=27–29}}

Cheryl I. Harris and [[Gloria Ladson-Billings]]  add the theoretical element of whiteness as property.  They describe whiteness as the ultimate property which whites alone can possess.  It is valuable and is property. The 'property functions of whiteness'—rights to disposition, rights to use and enjoyment, reputation and status property, and the absolute right to exclude—make the American dream a more likely and attainable reality for whites as citizens. For a CRT critic, the white skin color that some Americans possess is like owning a piece of property.  It grants privileges to the owner that a renter (or a person of color) would not be afforded.{{sfnm |1a1=Harris |1y=1993 |2a1=Ladson-Billings |2y=1999 |2p=15}}

Karen Pyke documents the theoretical element of [[internalized racism]] or internalized racial [[oppression]]. The victims of racism begin to believe the ideology that they are inferior and white people and white culture are superior.  The internalizing of racism is not due to any weakness, ignorance, inferiority, psychological defect, gullibility, or other shortcomings of the oppressed. Instead, it is how authority and [[power (social and political)|power]] in all aspects of society contributes to feelings of inequality.{{sfn|Pyke|2010|p=552}}

Camara Phyllis Jones defines [[institutionalized racism]] as the structures, policies, practices, and norms resulting in differential access to the goods, services, and opportunities of society by race. Institutionalized racism is normative, sometimes legalized and often manifests as inherited disadvantage. It is structural, having been absorbed into our institutions of custom, practice and law, so there need not be an identifiable offender. Indeed, institutionalized racism is often evident as inaction in the face of need.  Institutionalized racism manifests itself both in material conditions and in access to power. With regard to material conditions, examples include differential access to quality education, sound housing, gainful employment, appropriate medical facilities and a clean environment.{{sfn|Jones|2002|pp=9–10}}

As a movement that draws heavily from [[critical theory]], critical race theory shares many intellectual commitments with critical legal studies, critical theory, [[feminist legal theory|feminist jurisprudence]] and [[postcolonial theory]]. Though some authors like Tommy J. Curry have pointed out that such epistemic convergences with critical legal studies, critical theory, etc. are emphasized because of the idealist turn in critical race theory which is interested in discourse (how we speak about race) and the theories of white Continental philosophers, over and against the structural and institutional accounts of [[White supremacy#Academic use of the term|white supremacy]] which were at the heart of the realist analysis of racism introduced in Derrick Bell's early works{{sfn|Curry|2012}}{{page needed|date=September 2016}} articulated through Black thinkers like [[W. E. B. Du Bois]], Paul Robeson, and Judge Robert L. Carter.{{sfn|Curry|2009}}{{page needed|date=September 2016}}
Will Oremus wrote in ''[[Slate (magazine)|Slate]]''that CRT was radical "in the sense that it questions fundamental assumptions.... And unlike some strands of academic and legal thought, critical race theory has an open and activist agenda, with an emphasis on storytelling and personal experience. It's about righting wrongs, not just questing after knowledge" and that CRT is not "radical today in the sense of being outside the mainstream: Critical race theory is widely taught and studied."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine|url=http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/explainer/2012/03/derrick_bell_controversy_what_s_critical_race_theory_and_is_it_radical_.html|title=Did Obama Hug a Radical?|first=Will |last=Oremus |magazine=[[Slate (magazine)|Slate]] |date=March 9, 2012 |access-date=September 18, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Recent developments in critical race theory include work relying on updated [[social psychology]] research on unconscious bias to justify [[affirmative action]] and work relying on law and economics methodology to examine [[structural inequality]] and [[employment discrimination|discrimination in the workplace]].{{sfnm |1a1=Carbado |1a2=Gulati |1y=2003 |2a1=Kang |2a2=Banaji |2y=2006}}

== Latino critical race theory ==
The framework of Latino critical race theory (LatCRT) suggests that the social construction of race is central to how people of color are constrained in society.{{sfn|Treviño|Harris|Wallace|2008}} [[Tara J. Yosso]] discusses constraint of people of color can be defined in ''Critical Race Counterstories along the Chicana/Chicano Educational Pipeline''.{{sfn|Yosso|2006}} These tenets are what make LatCrt different because it looks at the differences between Chicano/a students. These tenets are: The ''inter''centricity of race and racism; the challenge of dominant Ideology; the commitment to [[social justice]]; the centrality of experience knowledge; and the interdisciplinary perspective.{{sfn|Yosso|2006|p=7}}

Race scholars developed the LatCRT as a critical response to the "problem of the color line" first explained by W. E. B. Du Bois.{{sfn|Treviño|Harris|Wallace|2008}} CRT focused on the Black–White paradigm, but LatCRT has moved to consider other racial groups, mainly Chicana/Chicanos. These groups include Latinos/as, Asians, LGBTQ,{{Clarify|date=January 2018}} Native Americans/First Nations, and women of color.

LatCRTs main focus is to advocate for social justice for people who live in [[social exclusion|marginalized communities]],{{sfn|Treviño|Harris|Wallace|2008}} specifically Chicana/Chicano individuals. These marginalized communities are guided by structural arrangements that disadvantage people of color. Social institutions function as dispossessions, disenfranchisement, and discrimination over minority groups, but the LatCRT seeks to give voice to those who are victimized.{{sfn|Treviño|Harris|Wallace|2008}} In order to give voice to those that are disenfranchised, LatCRT has created two common themes.

First, CRT proposes that white supremacy and racial power are maintained over time and that the law plays a central role in this process. Different racial groups lack the voice to speak in this civil society.  For this reason, the CRT has introduced a new critical form of expressions, called the "voice of color".{{sfn|Treviño|Harris|Wallace|2008}} The "voice of color" is narratives and storytelling monologues used as devices for conveying personal racial experiences. The "voices of color" are also used to counter [[metanarrative]]s that continue to maintain [[racial inequality]]. Thus, the experiences of the oppressed are important aspects for developing a LatCRT analytical approach. Not since the rise of slavery have we seen an institution that so fundamentally shapes the life opportunities of those who bear the label of criminal.

Second, LatCRT work has investigated the possibility of transforming the relationship between law enforcement and racial power, and more broadly, pursues a project of achieving racial emancipation and anti-subordination.{{sfn|Yosso|2005}} The CRT finds the experiential knowledge of people of color and draws explicitly from these lived experiences as data.{{sfn|Yosso|2006}} The CRT presents research findings through storytelling, chronicles, scenarios, narratives, and parables.{{sfn|Yosso|2006}}

== Applications ==
Scholars in critical race theory have focused with some particularity on the issues of hate crime and hate speech.  In response to the [[US Supreme Court]]'s opinion in the [[hate speech]] case of ''[[R. A. V. v. City of St. Paul]]'' (1992), in which the Court struck down an anti-bias ordinance as applied to a teenager who had burned a cross, [[Mari Matsuda]] and Charles Lawrence argued that the Court had paid insufficient attention to the history of racist speech and the actual injury produced by such speech.&lt;ref&gt;Mari J. Matsuda &amp; Charles R. Lawrence, Epilogue: Burning Crosses and the R.A.V.Case, in Matsuda ''et al.'', Words That Wound: Critical Race Theory, Assaultive Speech and the First Amendment (1993).&lt;/ref&gt;

Critical race theorists have also paid particular attention to the issue of affirmative action.  Many{{Weasel-inline|date=January 2018}} scholars have argued in favor of affirmative action on the argument that so-called merit standards for hiring and educational admissions are not race-neutral for a variety of reasons, and that such standards are part of the rhetoric of neutrality through which whites justify their disproportionate share of resources and social benefits.{{sfnm |1a1=Delgado |1y=1995 |2a1=Kennedy |2y=1990 |3a1=Williams |3y=1991}}

== Critique ==
Some legal scholars have criticized CRT on a number of grounds, such as CRT scholars' reliance on narrative and storytelling, or CRT's critique of objectivity. Judge [[Richard Posner]] of the United States [[United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit|Seventh Circuit Court of Appeals]]  has "label[ed] critical race theorists and postmodernists the 'lunatic core' of 'radical legal egalitarianism.'"&lt;ref name=Posner&gt;{{cite magazine |last=Posner |first=Richard A. |author-link=Richard Posner |date=October 13, 1997 |title=The Skin Trade |url=http://www.dariaroithmayr.com/pdfs/Posner-The%20Skin%20Trade-The%20New%20Republic.pdf |magazine=[[The New Republic]] |volume=217 |issue=15 |pages=40–43 |issn=0028-6583 |access-date=September 20, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He writes,
&lt;blockquote&gt;What is most arresting about critical race theory is that...it turns its back on the Western tradition of rational inquiry, forswearing analysis for narrative. Rather than marshal logical arguments and empirical data, critical race theorists tell stories — fictional, science-fictional, quasi-fictional, autobiographical, anecdotal—designed to expose the pervasive and debilitating racism of America today. By repudiating reasoned argumentation, the storytellers reinforce stereotypes about the [[Race and intelligence|intellectual capacities of nonwhites]].&lt;ref name=Posner /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Judge [[Alex Kozinski]] of the [[United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit|Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals]] writes that critical race theorists have constructed a philosophy which makes a valid exchange of ideas between the various disciplines unattainable.
&lt;blockquote&gt;The radical multiculturalists' views raise insuperable barriers to mutual understanding. Consider the "[[The Space Traders|Space Traders]]" story. How does one have a meaningful dialogue with Derrick Bell? Because his thesis is utterly untestable, one quickly reaches a dead end after either accepting or rejecting his assertion that white Americans would cheerfully sell all blacks to the aliens. The story is also a poke in the eye of American Jews, particularly those who risked life and limb by actively participating in the civil rights protests of the 1960s. Bell clearly implies that this was done out of tawdry self-interest. Perhaps most galling is Bell's insensitivity in making the symbol of Jewish hypocrisy the little girl who perished in the Holocaust—as close to a saint as Jews have. A Jewish professor who invoked the name of Rosa Parks so derisively would be bitterly condemned—and rightly so.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Kozinski |first=Alex |author-link=Alex Kozinski |date=November 2, 1997 |title=Bending the Law |url=https://www.nytimes.com/books/97/11/02/reviews/971102.02kosinst.html |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |access-date=September 17, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Daniel Farber and Suzanna Sherry have argued that critical race theory, along with critical feminism and critical legal studies, has [[antisemitism|antisemitic]] and anti-Asian implications, has worked to undermine notions of democratic community and has impeded dialogue.{{sfn|Farber|Sherry|1997|pp=9–11}}

[[Henry Louis Gates Jr.]] has written a critical evaluation of CRT.{{sfn|Gates|1996}} Gates emphasizes how campus speech codes and anti-hate speech laws have been applied to anti-white speech, contrary to the intentions of CRT theorists: "During the year in which Michigan's speech code was enforced, more than twenty blacks were charged—by whites—with racist speech. As Trossen notes, not a single instance of white racist speech was punished."

Jeffrey J. Pyle wrote in the ''[[Boston College Law Review]]'':&lt;blockquote&gt;Critical race theorists attack the very foundations of the [classical] liberal legal order, including equality theory, legal reasoning, Enlightenment rationalism and neutral principles of constitutional law. These liberal values, they allege, have no enduring basis in principle, but are mere social constructs calculated to legitimate white supremacy. The rule of law, according to critical race theorists, is a false promise of principled government, and they have lost patience with false promises.{{sfn|Pyle|1999|p=788}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Peter Wood considers CRT a "grievance ideology" and an "absurdity". He sees the central tenet of "white racism in the American legal system" to be shown false because of items such as the [[Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|14th Amendment]], the [[Voting Rights Act]]s and ''[[Brown v. Board of Education]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://chronicle.com/blogs/innovations/bell-epoque/31897|title=Bell Epoque|first=Peter |last=Wood|date=March 13, 2012|work=[[The Chronicle of Higher Education]]|access-date=September 18, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Offshoot fields ==
Within critical race theory, various sub-groupings have emerged to focus on issues that fall outside the black-white paradigm of race relations as well as issues that relate to the intersection of race with issues of gender, sexuality, class and other social structures. See for example, critical race feminism (CRF), Latino critical race studies (LatCrit){{sfn|Delgado|Stefancic|1998}} Asian American critical race studies (AsianCrit), South Asian American critical race studies (DesiCrit),{{sfn|Harpalani|2013}} and American Indian critical race studies (sometimes called TribalCrit). CRT methodology and analytical framework have also been applied to the study of white immigrant groups.{{sfn|Myslinska|2014a|pp=559–560}}

Critical race theory has also begun to spawn research that looks at understandings of race outside the United States.{{sfn|Myslinska|2014b}}&lt;ref&gt;See, e.g., {{harvnb|Levin|2008}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Controversies and impact ==
Critical race theory has stirred controversy since the 1980s over such issues as its deviation from the ideal of [[Color blindness (race)|color blindness]], promotion of the use of narrative in legal studies, advocacy of "legal instrumentalism" as opposed to ideal-driven uses of the law, analysis of the Constitution and existing law as constructed according to and perpetuating racial power, and encouraging legal scholars to be partial on the side of ending racial subordination.&lt;ref name=Ansell&gt;{{Cite book | publisher = SAGE | isbn = 978-1-4129-2694-2 | pages = 344–46 | editors = Richard T. Schaefer (ed.) | last = Ansell | first = Amy | title = Encyclopedia of Race, Ethnicity, and Society | chapter = Critical Race Theory | year = 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Conservative opponents of political appointees including [[Lani Guinier]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| pages = 78| last = Will| first = George| title = Sympathy for Guinier| work = Newsweek| date = June 14, 1993}}&lt;/ref&gt; have included a general critique of critical race theory in their criticism of these figures' actions on racial issues.

Critics including [[George Will]] saw resonances between critical race theory's use of storytelling and insistence that race poses challenges to objective judgments in the US and the [[O. J. Simpson murder case|acquittal of O. J. Simpson]].&lt;ref name=Ansell /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |last = Will |first = George |author-link = George Will |title = Good News?

In 2012, [[Matt de la Peña]]'s  young adult novel ''[[Mexican WhiteBoy]]'', about a boy who wants to grow up to become a baseball player, was banned from being taught in class&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/03/19/education/racial-lens-used-to-cull-curriculum-in-arizona.html | work=The New York Times | first=Michael | last=Winerip | title=Racial Lens Used to Cull Curriculum in Arizona | date=March 19, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the Mexican-American studies program in Tucson, Arizona, was disbanded in part because of their connection to CRT, which was seen to be in violation of a recently passed state law that "prohibits schools from offering courses that 'advocate ethnic solidarity instead of the treatment of pupils as individuals'."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=How Breitbart and Arizona seized on "critical race theory"|date=March 21, 2012|work=Salon|author=Alex Seitz-Wald|url=http://www.salon.com/2012/03/21/how_breitbart_and_arizona_seized_on_critical_race_theory/singleton/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2642">'''Cultural emphasis''' is an important aspect of a culture which is often reflected though language and, more specifically, vocabulary (Ottenheimer, 2006, p.&amp;nbsp;266).  This means that the vocabulary people use in a culture indicates what is important to that group of people.  If there are a lot of words to describe a certain topic in a specific culture, then there is a good chance that that topic is considered important to that culture.

== Background ==
The idea of cultural emphasis is rooted form the work of Franz Boas, who is considered to be one of the founders of American Anthropology (Ottenheimer, 2006, p.&amp;nbsp;15). Franz Boas developed and taught concepts such as [[cultural relativism]] and the "cultural unconscious", which allowed anthropologists who studied under him, like [[Edward Sapir]] and [[Ruth Benedict]], to further study and develop ideas on language and culture (Hart, 2005, p.&amp;nbsp;179).

== Application ==
One way in which cultural emphasis is exemplified is a populace talks about the weather.  For example, in a place where it is cold and it snows a lot, a large collection of words to describe the snow would be expected.

:For example: [[Whiteout (weather)|whiteout]], [[blizzard]], [[Ice storm|sleeting]], [[snowdrift]], powder snow, packed snow, fresh snow.

In a place where it is hot, a cornucopia of associated terms would be expected.

:For example: dry heat, muggy, humid, sticky, monsoon season, sweltering.
A concentration of related terms for similar phenomena suggests the importance in distinguishing between them.  Furthermore, if you are not from the area, or that culture, you might not have experienced or know the difference between, for example, a dry heat or a humid heat, when the difference may have huge implications for the outcome of a particular action.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7766">The '''Declaration on Crimes of Communism''' is a declaration signed on 25 February 2010 by several prominent European politicians, former political prisoners, human rights advocates and historians, which calls for the condemnation of [[communism]]. 
==Creation==
It concluded the international conference Crimes of the [[Communist Regime]]s, that took place at the [[Czech Senate]] and the Office of the Government of the Czech Republic from 24 to 26 February 2010. The declaration reiterated many of the suggestions set forth by the [[Prague Declaration on European Conscience and Communism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ustrcr.cz/en/international-conference-crimes-of-the-communist-regimes |title=International conference: Crimes of the Communist Regimes |author= |4= |work= |publisher=[[Institute for the Study of Totalitarian Regimes]] |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5yfMt85Af?url=http://www.ustrcr.cz/en/international-conference-crimes-of-the-communist-regimes |archivedate=2011-05-14 |accessdate=2011-05-14 |quote= |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
===Hosts===
The conference was hosted by [[Jiří Liška (statesman)|Jiří Liška]], Vice President of the Czech Senate, and the [[Government of the Czech Republic|Office of the Government of the Czech Republic]], and organized by the [[Institute for the Study of Totalitarian Regimes]] under the patronage of [[Jan Fischer (politician)|Jan Fischer]], [[Prime Minister of the Czech Republic]], [[Heidi Hautala]], Chairwoman of the Human Rights Subcommittee of the European Parliament, [[Göran Lindblad]], Vice President of the [[Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe]], among others. The cooperation partners included the [[Konrad Adenauer Foundation]], the Information Office of the [[European Parliament]], the Representation of the European Commission in the Czech Republic, the Robert Schuman Foundation of the [[European People's Party]], the [[Polish Institute in Prague]], the [[Federal Commissioner for the Stasi Records]] and the [[National Endowment for Democracy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.crimesofcommunism.eu/home.html |title=International Conference: Crimes of the Communist Regimes: About the conference |author= |4= |work= |publisher=[[Institute for the Study of Totalitarian Regimes]] |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5yfNiFRIt?url=http://www.crimesofcommunism.eu/home.html |archivedate=2011-05-14 |accessdate=2011-05-14 |quote= |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Content==
The declaration both called for condemnation of communism, education about communist crimes, prosecution of communist criminals by establishing an international court within the EU for communist crimes, construction of a memorial to the victims of world communism, and reduction of pensions and social security benefits for communist perpetrators. The declaration stated that:
*"Communist regimes have committed, and are in some cases still committing, crimes against humanity in all countries of Central and Eastern Europe and in other countries where communism is still alive"
*"Crimes against humanity are not subject to statutory limitations according to international law; however, the justice done to perpetrators of Communist crimes over the past 20 years has been extremely unsatisfactory"
*"We must not deny the tens of millions of victims of Communism their right to justice"
*"Since crimes against humanity committed by the communist regimes do not fall under the jurisdiction of existing international courts, we call for the creation of a new international court with a seat within the EU for the crimes of communism. Communist crimes against humanity must be condemned by this court in a similar way as the Nazi crimes were condemned and sentenced by the Nuremberg tribunal, and as the crimes committed in former Yugoslavia were condemned and sentenced"
*"Not punishing the communist criminals means disregard of and thus weakening of international law"
*"As an act of reparation and restitution, European countries must introduce legislation that equalizes the pensions and social security benefits of perpetrators of communist crimes so that they are equal to or smaller than those of their victims"
*"As democracy must learn to be capable of defending itself, Communism needs to be condemned in a similar way as Nazism was. We are not equating the respective crimes of Nazism and Communism, including the Gulag, the Laogai and the Nazi concentration camps. They should each be studied and judged on their own terrible merits. Communist ideology and communist rule contradict the European Convention of Human Rights and the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the EU. Just as we are not willing to relativise crimes of Nazism, we must not accept a relativisation of crimes of Communism."
*"We call upon EU member states to increase the awareness raising and education about crimes of communism; we remind them of the need to implement, without further delay, the Resolution of the European Parliament (2 April 2009) to mark 23 August as the European-wide Day of Remembrance of the victims of all totalitarian and authoritarian regimes."
*"We call upon the European Commission and European Council of Justice and Home Affairs to adopt a Framework Decision introducing a pan-European ban on excusing, denying or trivializing the crimes of communism."
*"The creation of the Platform of European Memory and Conscience, as supported by the European Parliament and the EU Council in 2009, must be completed at EU level. Individual governments must live up to their commitments regarding the work of the Platform."
*"As an act of recognition of the victims and respect for the immense suffering inflicted upon half of the continent, Europe must erect a memorial to the victims of world Communism, following the example of [[Victims of Communism Memorial|the memorial in the USA in Washington, D.C.]]"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.crimesofcommunism.eu/declaration.html |title=Declaration on Crimes of Communism |author= |4= |work= |publisher=[[Institute for the Study of Totalitarian Regimes]] |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5yfNE22gE?url=http://www.crimesofcommunism.eu/declaration.html |archivedate=2011-05-14 |accessdate=2011-05-14 |quote= |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Philip-ii-of-macedon.jpg|thumb|right|Tradition attributes the origin of the motto to [[Philip of Macedonia]]: διαίρει καὶ βασίλευε ''diaírei kài basíleue'', in [[Ancient Greek language|ancient Greek]]: «divide and rule»]]
'''Divide and rule''' (from [[Latin]] ''dīvide et imperā''), or '''divide and conquer''', in [[politics]] and [[sociology]] is gaining and maintaining [[Power (social and political)|power]] by breaking up larger concentrations of power into pieces that individually have less power than the one implementing the strategy. The concept refers to a strategy that breaks up existing power structures, and especially prevents smaller power groups from linking up, causing rivalries and fomenting discord among the people. It was heavily used by [[British Empire]] in [[India]] and elsewhere.&lt;ref name="Ilia Xypolia 2016. P. 9"&gt;Ilia Xypolia. 'Divide et Impera: Vertical and Horizontal Dimensions of British Imperialism'. Critique: journal of socialist theory, vol 44, no. 3, pp. 221-231, 2016. P. 221.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Traiano Boccalini]] cites "divide et impera" in ''La bilancia politica''&lt;ref&gt;'''1''' §136 and '''2''' §225&lt;/ref&gt; as a common principle in politics. The use of this technique is meant to empower the sovereign to control subjects, populations, or factions of different interests, who collectively might be able to oppose his rule. [[Machiavelli]] identifies a similar application to military strategy, advising in Book VI of ''The Art of War''&lt;ref&gt;[http://etext.library.adelaide.edu.au/m/machiavelli/niccolo/m149a/chapter6.html http://etext.library.adelaide.edu.au] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070625213056/http://etext.library.adelaide.edu.au/m/machiavelli/niccolo/m149a/chapter6.html |date=25 June 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; (''Dell'arte della guerra''),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.intratext.com/IXT/ITA1109/_P7.HTM|title=Dell'arte  della guerra: testo - IntraText CT|work=intratext.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; that a Captain should endeavor with every art to divide the forces of the enemy, either by making him suspicious of his men in whom he trusted, or by giving him cause that he has to separate his forces, and, because of this, become weaker.

The maxim ''divide et impera'' has been attributed to [[Philip II of Macedon]], and together with the maxim ''divide ut regnes'' was utilised by the Roman ruler [[Julius Caesar|Caesar]] and the French emperor [[Napoleon]].

The strategy, but not the phrase, applies in many ancient cases: the example of [[Aulus Gabinius|Gabinius]] exists, parting [[Iudaea Province|the Jewish nation]] into five conventions, reported by [[Flavius Josephus]] in Book I, 169-170 of ''The Wars of the Jews'' (''De bello Judaico'').&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?lookup=J.+BJ+1.159 |title=Flavius Josephus, The Wars of the Jews, Book I, section 159 |publisher=[[Perseus Project]] |date= |accessdate=2011-08-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Strabo]] also reports in ''Geography'', 8.7.3&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?lookup=Strab.+8.7.1 |title=Strabo, Geography, Book 8, chapter 7, section 1 |publisher=[[Perseus Project]] |date= |accessdate=2011-08-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; that the [[Achaean League]] was gradually dissolved under the Roman possession of the whole of [[Macedonia (ancient kingdom)|Macedonia]], owing to them not dealing with the several states in the same way, but wishing to preserve some and to destroy others.

The strategy of division and rule has been attributed to sovereigns, ranging from [[Louis XI]] to [[Habsburgs|the Habsburgs]]. [[Edward Coke]] denounces it in Chapter I of the Fourth Part of the ''Institutes'', reporting that when it was demanded by the [[House of Lords|Lords]] and [[British House of Commons|Commons]] what might be a principal motive for them to have good success in [[Parliament of England|Parliament]], it was answered: "''Eritis insuperabiles, si fueritis inseparabiles. Explosum est illud diverbium: Divide, &amp; impera, cum radix &amp; vertex imperii in obedientium consensu rata sunt.''" [You would be insuperable if you were inseparable. This proverb, Divide and rule, has been rejected, since the root and the summit of authority are confirmed by the consent of the subjects.] On the other hand, in a minor variation, [[Francis Bacon|Sir Francis Bacon]] wrote the phrase "separa et impera" in a letter to [[James I of England|James I]] of 15 February 1615. [[James Madison]] made this recommendation in a letter to [[Thomas Jefferson]] of 24 October 1787,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://press-pubs.uchicago.edu/founders/documents/v1ch17s22.html |title=Constitutional Government: James Madison to Thomas Jefferson |publisher=Press-pubs.uchicago.edu |date= |accessdate=2011-08-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; which summarized the thesis of ''[[Federalist Papers|The Federalist#10]]'':&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.constitution.org/fed/federa10.htm|title=The Federalist #10|work=constitution.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; "Divide et impera, the reprobated axiom of tyranny, is under certain (some) qualifications, the only policy, by which a republic can be administered on just principles." In ''Perpetual Peace: A Philosophical Sketch''
by Immanuel Kant (1795), Appendix one, ''Divide et impera'' is the third of three political maxims, the others being ''Fac et excusa'' (Act now, and make excuses later) and ''Si fecisti, nega'' (when you commit a crime, deny it).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.constitution.org/kant/append1.htm |title=Immanuel Kant: Perpetual Peace: Appendix I |publisher=Constitution.org |date= |accessdate=2011-08-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Elements of this technique involve:
* creating or encouraging divisions among the subjects to prevent alliances that could challenge the sovereign
* aiding and promoting those who are willing to cooperate with the sovereign
* fostering distrust and enmity between local rulers
* encouraging meaningless expenditures that reduce the capability for political and military spending

Historically, this strategy was used in many different ways by empires seeking to expand their territories.

The concept is also mentioned as a strategy for market action in [[economics]] to get the most out of the players in a competitive market.

==Narcissism==
{{Main article|Narcissism|Narcissistic parent|Narcissism in the workplace}}
A primary strategy the narcissist uses to assert [[Abusive power and control|control]], particularly within his/her family, is to create divisions among individuals. This weakens and [[Isolation to facilitate abuse|isolates]] them, making it easier for the narcissist to [[Psychological manipulation|manipulate]] and dominate. Some are favoured, others are [[scapegoated]]. Such dynamics can play out in a workplace setting.&lt;ref&gt; Hall J [http://narcissistfamilyfiles.com/2017/03/27/its-you-and-me-baby-narcissist-head-games/ It’s You and Me Baby: Narcissist Head Games] The Narcissist Family Files 27 Mar 2017&lt;/ref&gt;

==Psychopathy in the workplace==
{{Main article|Psychopathy in the workplace}}
Clive R. Boddy found that "divide and conquer" was a common strategy by corporate [[psychopaths]] used as a smokescreen to help consolidate and advance their grip on power in the corporate hierarchy.&lt;ref name=Boddy&gt;Boddy, C. R. [https://books.google.com/books?id=C0l9DAAAQBAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Corporate Psychopaths: Organizational Destroyers] (2011)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Historical examples==

===Africa===
The divide and conquer strategy was used by foreign countries in parts of [[Africa]] during the [[Scramble for Africa|colonial]] and post-colonial period.
* Germany and [[Belgium]] ruled [[Rwanda]] and [[Burundi]] in a colonial capacity. Germany used the strategy of divide and conquer by placing members of the already dominant [[Tutsi]] minority in positions of power. When Belgium took over colonial rule in 1916, the Tutsi and [[Hutu]] groups were rearranged according to race instead of occupation. Belgium defined "Tutsi" as anyone with more than ten cows or a long nose, while "Hutu" meant someone with less than ten cows and a broad nose. The socioeconomic divide between Tutsis and Hutus continued after independence and was a major factor in the [[Rwandan Genocide]].
* During [[British Colony and Protectorate of Nigeria|British]] rule of [[Nigeria]] from 1900 to 1960, different regions were frequently reclassified for administrative purposes. The conflict between the [[Igbo people|Igbo]] and [[Hausa people|Hausa]] made it easier for the British to consolidate their power in the region.{{Citation needed|date=November 2010}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.historyworld.net/wrldhis/PlainTextHistories.asp?historyid=ad41|title=HISTORY OF NIGERIA|work=historyworld.net}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Asia===

====Mongolian Empire====
* While the Mongols imported Central Asian Muslims to serve as administrators in China, the Mongols also sent Han Chinese and Khitans from China to serve as administrators over the Muslim population in Bukhara in Central Asia, using foreigners to curtail the power of the local peoples of both lands. Pakistan and India were also divided by this policy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|jstor=41930343|journal=Journal of Asian History|title=SINO-KHITAN ADMINISTRATION IN MONGOL BUKHARA|last=BUELL|first=PAUL D.|volume= 13|number=2|date=1979|pages=137–8|publisher=Harrassowitz Verlag}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Indian subcontinent====
The strategy of "Divide and Rule" was employed by most imperial powers in [[Indian subcontinent]]. The British and French backed various Indian states in conflicts between each other, both as a means of undermining each other's influence and consolidating their authority. The [[Durrand line]] divided [[Afghanistan]] and Northwest [[Pakistan]], the homeland of the [[Pashtuns]].

Further, it is argued that the British used the strategy to destroy the harmony between various religions and use it for their benefits&lt;ref&gt;Shashi Tharoor - Inglorious Empire What the British Did to India&lt;/ref&gt;; a ''Times Literary Supplement'' review suggests that although this was broadly the case a more nuanced approach might be closer to the facts&lt;ref&gt;Jon Wilson, 2016, ''India Conquered: Britain's Raj and the chaos of empire'', cited in a review of Tharoor's work by Elizabeth Buettner in "Debt of Honour: why the European impact on India must be fully acknowledged", ''Times Literary Supplement'', August 11 2017, pages 13-14.&lt;/ref&gt;.

====Middle East====
* The [[Sykes-Picot Agreement]], which carved the Middle East, is an example of a 'divide and rule' strategy.
* Some analysts assert that the US is practicing the strategy in the 21st century middle east through escalation of the [[Sunni-Shia conflict]]. [[Nafeez Ahmed]] cites a 2008 [[RAND Corporation]] study for the American military which recommended "divide and rule" as a possible strategy against the Muslim world in "[[War on Terror#Etymology|the Long War.]]" &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Pernin|first=Christopher G., et al|date=2008|title=Unfolding the Future of the Long War|url=https://www.rand.org/content/dam/rand/pubs/monographs/2008/RAND_MG738.pdf|journal=US Army Training and Doctrine Command’s Army Capability Integration Center|volume=|pages=|via=RAND Arroyo}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dr. [[Christopher Davidson]] argues that the current [[Yemeni Civil War (2015–present)|crisis in Yemen]] is being “egged on” by the US, and could be part of a wider covert strategy to “spur fragmentation in Iran allies and allow Israel to be surrounded by weak states”.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.middleeasteye.net/columns/pentagon-plan-divide-and-rule-muslim-world-1690265165|title=The Pentagon plan to ‘divide and rule’ the Muslim world|work=Middle East Eye|access-date=2018-06-29|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Europe===
* Romans entered [[Macedonia (ancient kingdom)|Macedonia]] from the south and defeated King [[Perseus of Macedon]] in the [[Battle of Pydna]] in 168 BC. Macedonia was then divided into four republics that were heavily restricted from relations with one another and other Hellenic states. A ruthless purge occurred, with allegedly anti-Roman citizens being denounced by their compatriots and deported in large numbers.
* During the [[Gallic Wars]], [[Julius Caesar]] was able to use a divide and rule strategy to easily defeat the militarily strong [[Gauls]]. By the time the Gauls united under [[Vercingetorix]], it was already too late for them.&lt;ref name="EB_The_Roman_Conquest"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://global.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/215768/France/41196/The-press |title=France: The Roman conquest |last1= |first1= |last2= |first2= |date= |website=[[Encyclopædia Britannica Online]] |publisher=[[Encyclopædia Britannica (company)|Encyclopædia Britannica]] |access-date=April 6, 2015 |quote="Because of chronic internal rivalries, Gallic resistance was easily broken, though Vercingetorix's Great Rebellion of 52 bce had notable successes."}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="The_first_triumvirate_and_the_conquest_of_Gaul"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://global.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/88114/Julius-Caesar/9735/The-first-triumvirate-and-the-conquest-of-Gaul |title=Julius Caesar: The first triumvirate and the conquest of Gaul |last1= |first1= |last2= |first2= |date= |website=[[Encyclopædia Britannica Online]] |publisher=[[Encyclopædia Britannica (company)|Encyclopædia Britannica]] |access-date=February 15, 2015 |quote="Indeed, the Gallic cavalry was probably superior to the Roman, horseman for horseman. Rome's military superiority lay in its mastery of strategy, tactics, discipline, and military engineering. In Gaul, Rome also had the advantage of being able to deal separately with dozens of relatively small, independent, and uncooperative states. Caesar conquered these piecemeal, and the concerted attempt made by a number of them in 52 bce to shake off the Roman yoke came too late."}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Following the [[October revolution]], the [[Bolsheviks]] engaged at various times in alliances with the [[Left Socialist-Revolutionaries]], some [[Anarchists#Russian Revolution|anarchists]], and various non-Russian ethnic [[nationalist]] groups, against the [[White movement]], [[Right Socialist-Revolutionaries]], and other anarchist and ethnic nationalist groups. This was done to establish the [[Communist Party of the Soviet Union]] (the Bolshevik party) as the sole legal party in the [[Soviet Union]]. Similar shifting alliances were played out amongst various dissident factions within the CPSU, such as the [[Workers Opposition]] and [[Left Communists]], with [[Joseph Stalin]] and his supporters gaining absolute power within the party by the mid-1920s.
* The [[Salami strategy]] of Hungarian Communist leader, [[Mátyás Rákosi]].{{Citation needed|date=August 2007}}
* Alliances with various parties played a role in the Nazi ''[[Machtergreifung]]'' and ''[[Gleichschaltung]]'', the seizure and consolidation of total power by the [[National Socialist German Workers Party]].

'''Elder abuse''' (also called "'''elder mistreatment'''", "'''senior abuse'''", "'''abuse in later life'''", "'''abuse of older adults'''", "'''abuse of older women'''", and "'''abuse of older men'''") is "a single, or repeated act, or lack of appropriate action, occurring within any relationship where there is an expectation of trust, which causes harm or distress to an older person."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.elderabuse.org.uk elderabuse.org.uk], accessed October 12, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; This definition has been adopted by the [[World Health Organization]] (WHO) from a definition put forward by Action on Elder Abuse in the UK. Laws protecting the elderly from abuse are similar to and related to, laws protecting [[dependent adult]]s from abuse.

It includes harms by people the older person knows, or has a relationship with, such as a spouse, partner, or family member; a friend or neighbor; or people that the older person relies on for services. Many forms of elder abuse are recognized as types of [[domestic violence]] or family violence since they are committed by family members. Paid caregivers have also been known to prey on their elderly patients.

While a variety of circumstances are considered elder abuse, it does not include general criminal activity against older persons, such as home break-ins, "muggings" in the street, or "distraction burglary", where a stranger distracts an older person at the doorstep while another person enters the property to steal.

The abuse of elders by caregivers is a worldwide issue. In 2002, WHO brought international attention to the issue of elder abuse.&lt;ref&gt;Cook-Daniels, L., (2003b, January/February). "2003 is the year elder abuse hits the international state." Victimization of the Elderly and Disabled. 5, 65-66, 76.&lt;/ref&gt; Over the years, government agencies and community professional groups, worldwide, have specified elder abuse as a social problem.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Rinkler A.G. | year = 2009 | title = Recognition and perception of elder abuse by prehospital and hospital-based care providers | url = | journal = Archives of Gerontology and Geriatrics | volume = 48 | issue = | pages = 110–115 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2006 the International Network for Prevention of Elder Abuse (INPEA) designated June 15 as World Elder Abuse Awareness Day (WEAAD), and an increasing number of events are held across the globe on this day to raise awareness of elder abuse and highlight ways to challenge such abuse.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.inpea.net/ International Network for the Prevention of Elder Abuse], accessed June 26, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

Although elders who have dementia or mental illness commonly make false accusations of theft and other forms of abuse by caregivers or family members, all reports of abuse must be investigated.

==Types==

Although there are common themes of elder abuse across nations, there are also unique manifestations based upon history, culture, economic strength, and societal perceptions of older people within nations themselves. The fundamental common denominator is the use of power and control by one individual to affect the well-being and status of another, older, individual.

There are several types of [[abuse]] of older people that are generally recognized as being elder abuse, including:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Robinson, De Benedictis, Segal|title=Elder Abuse and Neglect|url=http://www.helpguide.org/mental/elder_abuse_physical_emotional_sexual_neglect.htm|publisher=Help Guide|accessdate=15 December 2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121211154305/http://www.helpguide.org/mental/elder_abuse_physical_emotional_sexual_neglect.htm|archivedate=11 December 2012|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=What is Elder Abuse?|url=http://www.aoa.gov/AoA_programs/Elder_Rights/EA_Prevention/whatIsEA.aspx|publisher=Administration on Aging|accessdate=17 December 2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121220071251/http://www.aoa.gov/AoA_programs/Elder_Rights/EA_Prevention/whatIsEA.aspx|archivedate=20 December 2012|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* '''[[Physical abuse|Physical]]''': e.g. hitting, punching, slapping, burning, pushing, kicking, restraining, false imprisonment/confinement, or giving excessive or improper medication as well as withholding treatment and medication.
*'''[[Psychological abuse|Psychological/Emotional]]''': e.g. [[humiliating]] a person. A common theme is a perpetrator who identifies something that matters to an older person and then uses it to coerce an older person into a particular action. It may take verbal forms such as yelling,  name-calling, [[ridiculing]], [[hypercriticism|constantly criticizing]], accusations, [[blaming]], or nonverbal forms such as ignoring, silence, shunning or withdrawing affection.
* '''[[Elder financial abuse]]''': also known as financial exploitation, involving misappropriation of financial resources by family members, caregivers, or strangers, or the use of financial means to control the person or facilitate other types of abuse.
* '''[[Sexual abuse|Sexual]]''': e.g. forcing a person to take part in any sexual activity without his or her consent, including forcing them to participate in conversations of a sexual nature against their will; may also include situations where person is no longer able to give consent ([[dementia]]).
* '''[[Neglect]]''': e.g. depriving a person of proper medical treatment, food, heat, clothing or comfort or essential medication and depriving a person of needed services to force certain kinds of actions, financial and otherwise. Neglect can include leaving an at-risk (i.e. fall risk) elder person unattended. The deprivation may be intentional (active neglect) or happen out of lack of knowledge or resources (passive neglect).
 
In addition, some U.S. state laws&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nursinghomeabuselaws.org/elders/ Nursing Home Abuse Laws (NHAL)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120310015901/http://www.nursinghomeabuselaws.org/elders/ |date=2012-03-10 }}&lt;/ref&gt; also recognize the following as elder abuse:
* '''[[Abandonment (legal)#Failure to fulfill a responsibility|Abandonment]]''': deserting a dependent person with the intent to abandon them or leave them unattended at a place for such a time period as may be likely to endanger their health or welfare.&lt;ref name="Oregon Revised Statutes"&gt;Oregon Revised Statutes.&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Rights abuse''': denying the civil and constitutional rights of a person who is old, but not declared by court to be mentally incapacitated. This is an aspect of elder abuse that is increasingly being recognized and adopted by nations.
* '''[[Self-neglect]]''': any persons neglecting themselves by not caring about their own health, well-being or safety. Self-neglect (harm by self) is treated as conceptually different than abuse (harm by others). Elder self-neglect can lead to illness, injury, or even death. Common needs that older adults may deny themselves, or ignore are the following: Sustenance (food or water); cleanliness (bathing and personal hygiene); adequate clothing for climate protection; proper shelter; adequate safety; clean and healthy surroundings; medical attention for serious illness; essential medications.&lt;ref&gt;Tina de Benedictis, Ph.D., Jaelline Jaffe, Ph.D., and Jeanne Segal, Ph.D., (2007) Elder Abuse Types, Signs, Symptoms, Causes, and Help. Helpguide, helpguide.org.&lt;/ref&gt; Self-neglect is often created by an individual's declining mental awareness or capability. Some older adults may choose to deny themselves some health or safety benefits, which may not be self-neglect. This may simply be their personal choice. Caregivers and other responsible individuals must honor these choices if the older adult is sound of mind. In other instances, the older adult may lack the needed resources, as a result of poverty, or other social condition. This is also not considered as "self-neglect".&lt;ref&gt;Johnson, Christopher, JD. [http://www.christopherbjohnson.com/2015/02/19/elder-abuse-neglect-self-abuse/ "Elder Abuse: Neglect and Self Abuse"], California, 19 February 2015. Retrieved on 25 February 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''[[Institutional abuse]]''' refers to physical or psychological harms, as well as rights violations in settings where care and assistance is provided to dependent older adults or others, such as nursing homes. Recent studies of approximately 2,000 nursing home facility residents in the United States reported a growing abuse rate of 44% and neglect up to 95%,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nursinghomeabusecenter.com/elder-abuse/statistics/|title=Elder Abuse Statistics - Statistics on Elderly Abuse Over Time|work=Nursing Home Abuse Center|access-date=2018-04-11|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; making elder abuse in nursing homes a growing danger. Exact statistics are rare due to elder abuse in general and specifically in nursing homes being a silent condition.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.nursinghomeabuseguide.org/nursing-home-abuse-statistics/|title=Nursing Home Abuse Statistics - Elderly Care|access-date=2018-04-11|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.caregiver.org/selected-long-term-care-statistics|title=Selected Long-Term Care Statistics {{!}} Family Caregiver Alliance|website=www.caregiver.org|language=en|access-date=2018-04-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Warning signs==

The key to prevention and intervention of elder abuse is the ability to recognize the warning signs of its occurrence. Signs of elder abuse differ depending on the type of abuse the victim is suffering. Each type of abuse has distinct signs associated with it.
* '''Physical abuse''' can be detected by visible signs on the body, including bruises, scars, sprains, or broken bones. More subtle indications of physical abuse include signs of restraint, such as rope marks on the  wrist, or broken eyeglasses.&lt;ref name=Robinson&gt;{{cite web|last=Robinson|first=Lawrence|title=Elder abuse and neglect: Warning signs, risk factors, prevention, and help|url=http://www.helpguide.org/mental/elder_abuse_physical_emotional_sexual_neglect.htm|accessdate=16 December 2012|author2=Tina De Benedictis|author3=Jeanne Segal|date=November 2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121211154305/http://www.helpguide.org/mental/elder_abuse_physical_emotional_sexual_neglect.htm|archivedate=11 December 2012|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
* '''Emotional abuse''' often accompanies the other types of abuse and can usually be detected by changes in the personality or behavior. The elder may also exhibit behavior mimicking dementia, such as rocking or mumbling.&lt;ref name="Robinson" /&gt; Emotional abuse is the most underreported abuse of elder abuse. Elder abuse occurs when a person fails to treat an elder with respect and includes verbal abuse, the elder experiences social isolation, or lack of acknowledgement. Some indicators of the emotional effects of elder abuse is the elder adult being unresponsive or uncommunicative. Also they can be unreasonably suspicious or fearful, more isolated, and not wanting to be as social as they may have been before. Emotional abuse is under reported, but can have the most damaging effects because it leads to more physical and mental health problems.
* '''Financial exploitation''' is a more subtle form of abuse, in comparison to other types, and may be more challenging to notice. Signs of financial exploitation include significant withdrawals from accounts, belongings or money missing from the home, unpaid bills, and unnecessary goods or services.&lt;ref name="Robinson" /&gt; 
* '''Sexual abuse,''' like physical abuse, can be detected by visible signs on the body, especially around the breasts or genital area. Other signs include inexplicable infections, bleeding, and torn underclothing.&lt;ref name="Robinson" /&gt; 
* '''Neglect''' is a type of abuse in that it can be inflicted either by the caregiver or oneself. Signs of neglect include malnutrition and dehydration, poor hygiene, noncompliance to a prescription medication, and unsafe living conditions.&lt;ref name="Robinson" /&gt;

In addition to observing signs in the elderly individual,  abuse can also be detected by monitoring changes in the caregiver's behavior. For example, the caregiver may not allow them to speak to or receive visitors, exhibit indifference or a lack of affection towards the elder, or refer to the elder as "a burden." Caregivers who have a history of substance abuse or mental illness are more likely to commit elder abuse than other individuals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Signs and symptoms of elder abuse and neglect in care|url=http://www.advocare.org.au/help-with-aged-care-complaints/signs-and-symptoms-of-eld/|publisher=Advocare Incorporated|accessdate=16 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Abuse can sometimes be subtle, and therefore difficult, to detect. Regardless, awareness organizations and research advise to take any suspicion seriously and to address concerns adequately and immediately.

=== Signs of elder abuse ===

* Broken bones or fractures
* Poor physical appearance
* Changes in mental status
* Frequent infections
* Bruising, welts or cuts
* Unexplained weight loss
* Refusal to speak
* Signs of dehydration
* Lack of cleanliness

==Health consequences==

The health consequences of elder abuse are serious. Elder abuse can destroy an elderly person's quality of life in the forms of:&lt;ref name="Dong"&gt;{{cite journal | author = Dong X | year = 2005 | title = Medical Implications of Elder Abuse and Neglect | url = | journal = Clinics in Geriatric Medicine | volume = 21 | issue = | pages = 293–313 | doi=10.1016/j.cger.2004.10.006}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Declining functional abilities
* Increased dependency, sense of helplessness and stress
* Worsening psychological decline
* Premature mortality and morbidity
* Depression and dementia
* Malnutrition
* Bed sores
* Death

The risk of death for elder abuse victims are three times higher than for non-victims.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = American Medical Association White Paper on Elderly Health | year = 1990 | title = report on the Council on Scientific Affairs | url = | journal = Arch Intern Med | volume = 150 | issue = | pages = 2459–72 | doi=10.1001/archinte.1990.00390230019004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Common abusers==

An abuser can be a spouse, partner, relative, a friend or neighbor, a volunteer worker, a paid worker, practitioner, solicitor, or any other individual with the intent to deprive a vulnerable person of their resources. Relatives include adult children and their spouses or partners, their offspring and other extended family members. Children and living relatives who have a history of substance abuse or have had other life troubles are of particular concern. For example, [[Elder financial abuse#Hybrid financial exploitation|Hybrid Financial Exploitation (HFE)]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://psycnet.apa.org/record/2012-04350-001|title=Pure financial exploitation vs. Hybrid financial exploitation co-occurring with physical abuse and/or neglect of elderly persons|last=Jackson|first=Shelly L.|authorlink=|last2=Hafemeister|first2=Thomas L.|date=|website=|publisher="Psychology of Violence"|orig-year=|publication-date=2012|access-date=August 15, 2018}}{{dead link|date=September 2018|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}&lt;/ref&gt; abusive individuals are more likely to be a relative, chronically unemployed, and dependent on the elderly person.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Jackson S, Hafemeister T | year = 2012 | title = Pure financial exploitation vs. Hybrid financial exploitation co-occurring with physical abuse and/or neglect of elderly persons | url = | journal = Psychology Of Violence | volume = 2 | issue = 3| pages = 285–296 | doi=10.1037/a0027273}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, past studies have estimated that between 16% and 38% of all elder abusers have a history of mental illness. Elder abuse perpetrated by individuals with mental illnesses can be decreased by lessening the level of dependency that persons with serious mental illness have on family members. This can be done by funneling more resourced into housing assistance programs, intensive care management services, and better welfare benefits for individuals with serious mental illness.&lt;ref&gt;Labrum T, Solomon PL. Physical elder abuse perpetrated by relatives with serious mental illness: A preliminary conceptual social–ecological model. Aggression and Violent Behavior, 2015&lt;/ref&gt; People with substance abuse and mental health disorders typically have very small social networks, and this confinement contributes to the overall occurrence of elder abuse.&lt;ref&gt;Labrum T, Solomon PL. Elder mistreatment perpetrators with substance abuse and/or mental health conditions: Results from the National Elder Mistreatment Study. Psychiatric Quarterly, 2017 May 23. doi: 10.1007/s11126-017-9513-z. [Epub ahead of print]&lt;/ref&gt;

Perpetrators of elder abuse can include anyone in a [[position of trust]], control or authority over the individual. Family relationships, neighbors and friends, are all socially considered as relationships of trust, whether or not the older adult actually thinks of the people as "trustworthy". Some perpetrators may "groom" an older person (befriend or build a relationship with them) in order to establish a relationship of trust. Older people living alone who have no adult children living nearby are particularly vulnerable to "grooming" by neighbors and friends who would hope to gain control of their estates.

The majority of abusers are relatives, typically the older adult's spouse/partner or sons and daughters, although the type of abuse differs according to the relationship. In some situations the abuse is "domestic violence grown old", a situation in which the abusive behavior of a spouse or partner continues into old age. In some situations, an older couple may be attempting to care and support each other and failing, in the absence of external support. With sons and daughters it tends to be financial abuse, justified by a belief that it is nothing more than the "advance inheritance" of property, valuables and money.

Within paid care environments, abuse can occur for a variety of reasons. Some abuse is the willful act of cruelty inflicted by a single individual upon an older person. In fact, a case study in Canada suggests that the high elder abuse statistics are from repeat offenders who, like in other forms of abuse, practice elder abuse for the [[schadenfreude]] associated with the act. More commonly, institutional abuses or neglect may reflect lack of knowledge, lack of training, lack of support, or insufficient resourcing. Institutional abuse may be the consequence of common practices or processes that are part of the running of a care institution or service. Sometimes this type of abuse is referred to as "poor practice", although this term reflects the motive of the perpetrator (the causation) rather than the impact upon the older person.

With the aging of today's population, there is the potential that elder abuse will increase unless it is more comprehensively recognized and addressed.

Elder abuse is not a direct parallel to child maltreatment, as perpetrators of elder abuse do not have the same legal protection of rights as parents of children do. For example, a court order is needed to remove a child from their home but not to remove a victim of elder abuse from theirs.&lt;ref&gt;Beach SR, Carpenter CR, Rosen T, Sharps P, Gelles R. Screening and detection of elder abuse: Research opportunities and lessons learned from emergency geriatric care, intimate partner violence, and child abuse. Journal of Elder Abuse and Neglect. 2016; 28(4-5): 185-216. 10.1080/08946566.2016.1229241&lt;/ref&gt;

==Risk factors for elder abuse==

Various [[risk factors]] increase the likelihood that an elderly person will become a victim of elder abuse, including an elderly person who:&lt;ref name=" Hildreth"&gt;{{cite journal | author = Hildreth C.J. | year = 2011 | title = Elder Abuse | url = | journal = JAMA | volume = 306 | issue = 5| page = 568 | doi =  10.1001/jama.306.5.568 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Has memory problems (such as dementia)
* Has a mental illness, either long-standing or recent
* Has physical disabilities
* Has depression, loneliness, or lack of social support
* Abuses alcohol or other substances
* Takes prescribed medications that impair judgment
* Is verbally or physically combative with the caregiver
* Has a shared living situation

Several other risk factors increase the likelihood that a caregiver will participate in elder abuse, including a caregiver who:&lt;ref name="Hildreth" /&gt;
* Feels overwhelmed or resentful
* Has a history of substance abuse or a history of abusing others
* Is dependent on the older person for housing, finances, or other needs
* Has mental health problems
* Is unemployed
* Has a criminal history
* Has a shared living situation

In addition:
* Lower income or poverty has been found to be associated with elder abuse. Low economic resources have been conceptualized as a contextual or situational stressor contributing to elder abuse.
* Living with a large number of household members other than a spouse is associated with an increased risk of abuse, especially financial abuse.

Risk factors can also be categorized into individual, relationship, community, and sociocultural levels. At the individual level, elders who have poor physical and mental health are at higher risk. At the relationship level, a shared living situation is a huge risk factor for the elderly, and living in the same area as the abuser is more likely to result in abuse. At the community level, caregivers may knowingly or inadvertently cause social isolation of the elderly. At the sociocultural level, a representation of an older person as weak and dependent, lack of funds to pay for care, elderly people who need assistance but live alone, and destruction of bonds between the generation of a family are possible factors in elder abuse.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs357/en/|title=Elder abuse|website=World Health Organization|language=en-GB|access-date=2016-11-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Research and statistics==

There has been a general lack of reliable data in this area and it is often argued that the absence of data is a reflection of the low priority given to work associated with older people. However, over the past decade there has been a growing amount of research into the nature and extent of elder abuse. The research still varies considerably in the definitions being used, who is being asked, and what is being asked. As a result, the statistics used in this area vary considerably.

One study suggests that around 25% of vulnerable older adults will report abuse in the previous month, totaling up to 6% of the general elderly population.&lt;ref name="pmid18349012"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Cooper C, Selwood A, Livingston G |title=The prevalence of elder abuse and neglect: a systematic review |journal=Age Ageing |volume=37 |issue=2 |pages=151–60 |date=March 2008 |pmid=18349012 |doi=10.1093/ageing/afm194 |url=http://ageing.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&amp;pmid=18349012}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, some consistent themes are beginning to emerge from interaction with abused elders, and through limited and small scale research projects. Work undertaken in Canada suggests that approximately 70% of elder abuse is perpetrated against women and this is supported by evidence from the AEA helpline in the UK, which identifies women as victims in 67% of calls. Also domestic violence in later life may be a continuation of long term partner abuse and in some cases, abuse may begin with retirement or the onset of a health condition.&lt;ref&gt;Silent and Invisible: A Report on Abuse and Violence in the Lives of Older Women in British Columbia and Yukon, 2001.&lt;/ref&gt; Certainly, abuse increases with age, with 78% of victims being over 70 years of age.&lt;ref name="HiddenVoices"&gt;Hidden Voices, Action on Elder Abuse, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;

The higher proportion of spousal homicides supports the suggestion that abuse of older women is often a continuation of long term spousal abuse against women. In contrast, the risk of homicide for older men was far greater outside the family than within.&lt;ref&gt;Statistics Canada, 1999, 38.&lt;/ref&gt; This is an important point because the domestic violence of older people is often not recognized and consequently strategies, which have proved effective within the domestic violence arena, have not been routinely transferred into circumstances involving the family abuse of older people.

According to the AEA helpline in the UK, abuse occurs primarily in the family home (64%), followed by residential care (23%), and then hospitals (5%), although a helpline does not necessarily provide a true reflection of such situations as it is based upon the physical and mental ability of people to utilize such a resource.&lt;ref name="HiddenVoices" /&gt;

Research conducted in [[New Zealand]] broadly supports the above findings, with some variations. Of 1288 cases in 2002–2004, 1201 individuals, 42 couples, and 45 groups were found to have been abused. Of these, 70 percent were female. Psychological abuse (59%), followed by material/financial (42%), and physical abuse (12%) were the most frequently identified types of abuse. Sexual abuse occurred in 2% of reported cases.&lt;ref name="ACNZ" /&gt;
Age Concern New Zealand found that most abusers are family members (70%), most commonly sons or daughters (40%). Older abusers (those over 65 years) are more likely to be husbands.&lt;ref name="ACNZ"&gt;Age Concern Elder Abuse and Neglect Prevention Services: An Analysis of Referrals for the period 1 July 2002 to 30 June 2004. Age Concern New Zealand, November 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2007, 4,766 cases of suspected abuse, neglect, or financial exploitation involving older adults were reported, an increase of 9 percent over 2006. 19 incidents were related to a death, and a total of 303 incidents were considered life-threatening. About one in 11 incidents involved a life-threatening or fatal situation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Types of Nursing Home Abuse|url=http://bruceflint.com/types-and-symping-home-abuse/|accessdate=13 July 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160916212825/http://bruceflint.com/types-and-symping-home-abuse/|archive-date=16 September 2016|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2012, the study called Pure Financial Exploitation vs. Hybrid Exploitation Co-Occurring With Physical Abuse and/or Neglect of Elderly Persons by Shelly L. Jackson and Thomas L. Hafemeister brought attention to the hybrid abuse that elderly persons can experience. This study revealed that victims of hybrid financial exploitation or HFE lost an average of $185,574, a range of $20–$750,000.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"/&gt;

===Barriers to obtaining statistics===

Several conditions make it hard for researchers to obtain accurate statistics on elder abuse. Researchers may have difficulty obtaining accurate elder abuse statistics for the following reasons:

* Another reason why there is a lack of accurate statistics is the debate of whether to include self-neglect or not. Many are unsure if it should be included since it does not involve another person as an abuser. Those opposed to the inclusion of self-neglect make the claim that it is a different form of abuse and thus, should not be included in the statistics. Due to this discrepancy and the others mentioned above, it is difficult to get accurate data concerning the abuse of the elderly.&lt;ref&gt;Brownell, P., &amp; Rosich, G. (2007). Elder abuse. In J.

==Prevention==
[[File:Measures Used to Help Protect Older Adults with Guardians from Abuse (31560997996) (cropped).jpg|thumb|upright=2|Graphic depicting protective measures taken to prevent elder abuse, from the [[Government Accountability Office]]]]
Doctors, nurses, and other medical personnel can play a vital role in assisting elder abuse victims. Studies have shown that elderly individuals, on average, make 13.9 visits per year to a physician.&lt;ref&gt;Federal Interagency Forum on Aging-Related Statistics. Older Americans 2008: Key indicators of well-being. Federal Interagency Forum on Aging-Related Statistics, Washington, DC: Government Printing Office, March 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; Although there has been an increase in awareness of elder abuse over the years, physicians tend to only report 2% of elder abuse cases.&lt;ref name="Dong"/&gt; Reasons for lack of reporting by physicians include a lack of current knowledge concerning state laws on elder abuse, concern about angering the abuser and ruining the relationship with the elderly patient, possible court appearances, lack of cooperation from elderly patients or families, and lack of time and reimbursement.&lt;ref name="Dong"/&gt; Through education and training on elder abuse, health care professionals can better assist elder abuse victims.

Educating and training those in the criminal justice system, such as police, prosecutors, and the judiciary, on elder abuse, as well as increased legislation to protect elders, will also help to minimize elder abuse and will also provide improved assistance to victims of elder abuse.

In addition, community involvement in responding to elder abuse can contribute to elderly persons' safety. In general, preventing the occurrence or recurrence of elder abuse helps not only the elder but it may also improve the anxiety and depression of their caregivers too.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Baker|first1=PR|last2=Francis|first2=DP|last3=Hairi|first3=NN|last4=Othman|first4=S|last5=Choo|first5=WY|title=Interventions for preventing abuse in the elderly.|journal=The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews|date=16 August 2016|issue=8|pages=CD010321|doi=10.1002/14651858.CD010321.pub2|pmid=27528431}}&lt;/ref&gt; Communities can develop programs that are structured around meeting the needs of elderly persons. For example, several communities throughout the United States have created Financial Abuse Specialist Teams,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.coaoc.org/html/services_fast_description.htm&lt;/ref&gt;  which are multidisciplinary groups that consist of public and private professionals who volunteer their time to advise Adult Protective Services (APS), law enforcement, and private attorneys on matters of vulnerable adult financial abuse.&lt;ref&gt;Council on Aging Orange County, http://www.coaoc.org/html/services_fast_description.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

==False accusations of elder abuse==

It is important to recognize that false accusations of elder abuse are very common. An elderly person who has dementia or a mental illness may falsely claim to be a victim of abuse. By one estimate, 70% of elderly people with mental impairments such as dementia, delusions, or paranoia falsely accuse caregivers of stealing. Mentally impaired elders may claim that a caregiver is feeding them poisoned food or holding them prisoner. Websites such as Alzlive.com and DailyCaring.com offer advice for caregivers who are falsely accused of elder abuse or other crimes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://alzlive.com/tips/caregiving/false-accusations-theft/|title=False Accusations--Theft}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://dailycaring.com/8-ways-to-deal-with-false-dementia-accusations/|title=8 Ways to Deal with False Dementia Accusations}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://dailycaring.com/responding-to-4-common-dementia-accusations-stealing-poisoning-being-held-prisoner/|title=Responding to 4 Common Dementia Accusations: Stealing, Poisoning, Being Held Prisoner}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Electronic Poet''''', also known as '''''E.P. (Electronic Poet)''''', is an outdoor 1984 sculpture by [[Keith Jellum]], located above the sidewalk on Southwest Morrison Street, between 9th and 10th Avenues in downtown [[Portland, Oregon|Portland]], [[Oregon]]. The abstract piece is made of bronze and an [[Light-emitting diode|LED]] light board which displays poems programmed in a loop. It is administered by the [[Regional Arts &amp; Culture Council]].

==Description==
[[File:Electronic Poet, Portland (2014) - 2.jpg|left|thumb|upright|Plaque for the sculpture]]

The sculpture measures {{Convert|10|in|m}} x {{Convert|52|in|m}} x {{Convert|20|in|m}} and is made of bronze and an [[Light-emitting diode|LED]] light board.&lt;ref name=Regional&gt;{{cite web|title=Electronic Poet|url=http://racc.org/public-art/search/?recid=969.178|publisher=[[Regional Arts &amp; Culture Council]]|accessdate=September 25, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; It displays curated collections of poems programmed in an "evolving" loop, intended to be rotated every six months. Selections of Jellum's favorite poems from around the world have featured American poets born before 1990, European, Native American and Northwestern poets, and Oregon place names, among others.&lt;ref name=Anderson&gt;{{cite news|last1=Anderson|first1=Jennifer|title=Stumptown Stumper|url=http://portlandtribune.com/component/content/article?id=92227|accessdate=September 25, 2014|work=[[The Portland Tribune]]|date=September 20, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=PAA&gt;{{cite web|title=Electronic Poet|url=http://www.publicartarchive.org/work/electronic-poet|publisher=Public Art Archive|accessdate=September 24, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The artist wanted to create "opportunities for moments of reflection within the urban landscape".&lt;ref name=PAA/&gt;

==Reception==
"Dr. Know" (Marty Smith) of ''[[Willamette Week]]'' emphasized that the sculpture does not compose the text it displays and said its six-month rotation schedule "does not appear to be religiously observed".&lt;ref name=Smith&gt;{{cite news|last1=Smith|first1=Marty|title=Dr. Know: Whale Tail Tale|url=http://www.wweek.com/portland/article-22722-dr_know_whale_tail_tale.html|accessdate=September 25, 2014|work=[[Willamette Week]]|date=June 25, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Of the work's introduction, in the form of the text "I am E.P." being displayed approximately every ten minutes, Smith hypothesized: "Since ''E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial'' came out in 1982, possibly the Poet’s name was a play on the then-recent sci-fi blockbuster about another technologically advanced being with a wide, flat head. Possibly, but I hope not."&lt;ref name=Smith/&gt; The sculpture has been included in walking tours of Portland.&lt;ref name=Cook&gt;{{cite book|last1=Cook|first1=Sybilla Avery|title=Walking Portland|date=1998|publisher=Globe Pequot|page=58|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=oh_dA76n37gC&amp;pg=PA58&amp;lpg=PA58&amp;dq#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|accessdate=September 25, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An '''explanatory model''' is a useful description of why and how a thing works or an explanation of why a phenomenon is the way it is. The explanatory model is used as a substitute for "the&amp;nbsp;full&amp;nbsp;explanation" of the thing in question: 
* either because the full&amp;nbsp;explanation is unavailable
* or because the&amp;nbsp;full&amp;nbsp;explanation is too cumbersome to be practical in the case at hand.

Explanatory models do not claim to be a complete description/explanation of the absolute about the thing/phenomenon, nor do they even claim to, necessarily, be fully accurate. The description/explanation does, however, need to fit well enough to a sufficient portion of all the knowledge, observations and theoretical circumstances known about the thing/phenomenon, so that the explanatory model becomes useful.
That is: the description/explanation in an explanatory model, should be useful/helpful when one is about to make a decision or choice or when trying to successfully understand, explain or in some other way relate to the reality of the world around .Tewodros kassa

==Use of the term==
As most, if not all, explanations of anything, to a certain degree depend on [[axiom]]s, and thereby are incomplete and not really "the&amp;nbsp;''full''&amp;nbsp;explanation", then, strictly speaking, all explanations are in fact explanatory models.&lt;br&gt;
Yet,  the term "explanatory model" generally is used only when one feels the need to ''emphasize awareness of'' the incompleteness of an explanation (due to intentional simplification or due to lack of knowledge and understanding).

==Utility==
By being mindful of the difference between on the one hand: "absolute reality" and on the other hand: "the explanatory models that one has become accustomed to", then one will be better equipped to avoid erroneously rejecting important new knowledge, even when this new knowledge seem to clearly contradict that which one "knows" from before.

In [[psychology]], the '''external image''' (also '''alien image''', '''foreign image''', '''public image''', '''third-party image'''; {{lang-de|Fremdbild}}) is the [[image]] other people have of a [[person]], i.e., a person's external image is the way they are viewed by other people. It contrasts with a person's [[self image]] ({{lang-de|Selbstbild}}); how the external image is communicated to a person may affect their [[self esteem]] positively or negatively.

== Definition ==

An external image is the totality of all [[perception]]s, [[feeling]]s, and [[Value judgment|judgment]]s that third parties make about an [[individual]]. These [[interpersonal perception]]s are automatically linked to earlier experiences with the person being observed, and with the feelings arising from these interactions and evaluations. The image that others have of a person shapes their expectations of this person, and significantly affects their mutual social interaction.

== External image and self image ==

A person's external image, or more precisely, how this image is communicated to the individual, and how others react to the individual as a result of his or her external image, significantly affects the person's [[self image]]. Positive, appreciative external images strengthen an individual's [[self confidence]] and [[self esteem]]. In extreme cases, negative or conflicting external images can cause [[mental illness]].

The external image is always different from an individual's self-image. From the two perspectives and the differences between them - or more accurately, the inferences that the two parties draw for themselves, social interactions evolve, influenced by the parties' own [[Self|selves]].

== In group dynamics ==
[[File:Johari_Window.PNG|right|250px|thumb|[[Johari window]]]]
Conscious handling of images about each other plays an important part in [[group dynamics]]. In [[feedback]] exercises, subjects are trained in giving and receiving external images. The [[Johari window]] describes the relationship between external and self images, and that between conscious and unconscious parts of these images. With [[Mindfulness (psychology)|mindful]] "awareness exercises", a person is trained to detect previously unconscious expectations of third parties, and with communication exercises, they are trained to reconcile their own and others' images and expectations of each other.

== In psychotherapy ==

[[Psychotherapy]] also deals with external images when treating [[Clinical depression|depression]] or in dealing with the effects of [[Posttraumatic stress disorder|trauma]] or [[bullying]], or more generally in counseling members of [[marginalized group]]s.

This category encodes all the relevant geometric information about &lt;math&gt;V&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;V&lt;/math&gt; can be recovered from &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{Qcoh}(V)&lt;/math&gt; (the [[Gabriel–Rosenberg reconstruction theorem]]). This example gives rise to one approach to [[noncommutative algebraic geometry]]: the study of "non-commutative varieties" is then nothing but the study of (certain) Grothendieck categories.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Quantum Ruled Surfaces|author=Izuru Mori|year=2007|url=http://mathsoc.jp/section/algebra/algsymp_past/algsymp07_files/mouri.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Definition==
By definition, a Grothendieck category &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{A}&lt;/math&gt; is an [[AB5 category]] with a [[Generator (category theory)|generator]]. Spelled out, this means that
* &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{A}&lt;/math&gt; is an [[abelian category]];
* every (possibly infinite) family of objects in &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{A}&lt;/math&gt; has a [[coproduct]] (a.k.a. direct sum) in &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{A}&lt;/math&gt;;
* [[direct limit]]s of [[exact sequence]]s are exact; this means that if a direct system of [[short exact sequence]]s in &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{A}&lt;/math&gt; is given, then the induced sequence of direct limits is a short exact sequence as well. (Direct limits are always [[exact functor|right-exact]]; the important point here is that we require them to be [[exact functor|left-exact]] as well.)
* &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{A}&lt;/math&gt; possesses a generator, i.e. there is an object &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; in &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{A}&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{Hom}(G,-)&lt;/math&gt; is a [[faithful functor]] from &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{A}&lt;/math&gt; to the [[category of sets]]. (In our situation, this is equivalent to saying that every object &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; of &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{A}&lt;/math&gt; admits an [[epimorphism]] &lt;math&gt;G^{(I)}\rightarrow X&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;G^{(I)}&lt;/math&gt; denotes a direct sum of copies of &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt;, one for each element of the (possibly infinite) set &lt;math&gt;I&lt;/math&gt;.)

The name "Grothendieck category" neither appeared in Grothendieck's Tôhoku paper&lt;ref name="tohoku"/&gt; nor in Gabriel's thesis;&lt;ref name="gabriel-these"/&gt; it came into use in the second half of the 1960s by authors including J.-E. Roos, B. Stenström, U. Oberst, and B. Pareigis. (Some authors use a different definition in that they don't require the existence of a generator.)

==Examples==
* The prototypical example of a Grothendieck category is the [[category of abelian groups]]; the abelian group &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{Z}&lt;/math&gt; of integers can serve as a generator.
* More generally, given any [[ring (mathematics)|ring]] &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt; (associative, with &lt;math&gt;1&lt;/math&gt;, but not necessarily commutative), the category &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{Mod}(R)&lt;/math&gt; of all right (or alternatively: left) [[module (mathematics)|module]]s over &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt; is a Grothendieck category; &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt; itself can serve as a generator.
* Given a [[topological space]] &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt;, the category of all [[sheaf (mathematics)|sheaves]] of abelian groups on &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; is a Grothendieck category.&lt;ref name="tohoku"/&gt; (More generally: the category of all sheaves of right &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt;-modules on &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; is a Grothendieck category for any ring &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt;.)  
* Given a [[ringed space]] &lt;math&gt;(X,\mathcal{O}_X)&lt;/math&gt;, the category of [[Sheaves of modules|sheaves of ''O&lt;sub&gt;X&lt;/sub&gt;''-modules]] is a Grothendieck category.&lt;ref name="tohoku"/&gt;
* Given an (affine or projective) [[algebraic variety]] &lt;math&gt;V&lt;/math&gt; (or more generally: a [[quasi-compact]] [[Glossary of scheme theory#Separated and proper morphisms|quasi-separated]] [[scheme (mathematics)|scheme]]), the category &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{Qcoh}(V)&lt;/math&gt; of [[quasi-coherent sheaf|quasi-coherent sheaves]] on &lt;math&gt;V&lt;/math&gt; is a Grothendieck category.
* Given a small site (''C'', ''J'') (i.e. a small category ''C'' together with a [[Grothendieck topology]] ''J''), the category of all sheaves of abelian groups on the site is a Grothendieck category.

=== Constructing further Grothendieck categories ===

* Any category that's [[equivalence of categories|equivalent]] to a Grothendieck category is itself a Grothendieck category.
* Given Grothendieck categories  &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{A_1},\ldots,\mathcal{A_n}&lt;/math&gt;, the [[product category]]  &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{A_1}\times\ldots\times\mathcal{A_n}&lt;/math&gt; is a Grothendieck category.
* Given a [[Category (mathematics)#Small and large categories|small category]] &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{C}&lt;/math&gt; and a Grothendieck category &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{A}&lt;/math&gt;, the [[functor category]] &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{Funct}(\mathcal{C},\mathcal{A})&lt;/math&gt;, consisting of all [[Covariant functor|covariant functors]] from &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{C}&lt;/math&gt; to &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{A}&lt;/math&gt;, is a Grothendieck category.&lt;ref name="tohoku" /&gt;
* Given a small [[preadditive category|preadditive]] category &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{C}&lt;/math&gt; and a Grothendieck category &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{A}&lt;/math&gt;, the functor category &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{Add}(\mathcal{C},\mathcal{A})&lt;/math&gt; of all additive covariant functors from &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{C}&lt;/math&gt; to &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{A}&lt;/math&gt; is a Grothendieck category.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.de/books?id=vsfyCAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA487|title=Algebra: Rings, Modules and Categories I|last=Faith|first=Carl|publisher=Springer|year=1973|location=|pages=486-498|language=en|chapter=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* If &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{A}&lt;/math&gt; is a Grothendieck category and &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{C}&lt;/math&gt; is a [[localizing subcategory]] of &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{A}&lt;/math&gt;, then both &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{C}&lt;/math&gt; and the [[Serre quotient category]] &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{A}/\mathcal{C}&lt;/math&gt; are Grothendieck categories.&lt;ref name="gabriel-these" /&gt;

==Properties and theorems==
Every Grothendieck category contains an [[injective cogenerator]]. For example, an injective cogenerator of the category of abelian groups is the [[quotient group]] &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{Q}/\mathbb{Z}&lt;/math&gt;.

Every object in a Grothendieck category &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{A}&lt;/math&gt; has an [[injective hull]] in &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{A}&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref name="tohoku"/&gt;&lt;ref name="gabriel-these"/&gt;  This allows to construct [[injective resolution]]s and thereby the use of the tools of [[homological algebra]] in &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{A}&lt;/math&gt;, such as [[derived functor]]s. (Note that not all Grothendieck categories allow [[projective resolution]]s for all objects; examples are categories of sheaves of abelian groups on many topological spaces, such as on the space of real numbers.)

In a Grothendieck category, any family of [[subobject]]s &lt;math&gt;(U_i)&lt;/math&gt; of a given object &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; has a [[supremum]] (or "sum") &lt;math display="inline"&gt;\sum_i U_i&lt;/math&gt; as well as an [[infimum]] (or "intersection") &lt;math&gt;\cap_i U_i&lt;/math&gt;, both of which are again subobjects of &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt;. Further, if the family &lt;math&gt;(U_i)&lt;/math&gt; is directed (i.e. for any two objects in the family, there is a third object in the family that contains the two), and &lt;math&gt;V&lt;/math&gt; is another subobject of &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt;, we have
:&lt;math&gt;\sum_{i}(U_i\cap V) = \left(\sum_{i}U_i\right) \cap V.&lt;/math&gt;

Grothendieck categories are [[Subobject|well-powered]] (sometimes called ''locally small'', although that term is also used for a different concept), i.e. the collection of subobjects of any given object forms a set (rather than a [[proper class]]).&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

An object &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; in a Grothendieck category is called ''finitely generated'' if the sum of every directed family of proper subobjects of &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; is again a proper subobject of &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt;. (In the case &lt;math&gt;{\cal A} = \operatorname{Mod}(R)&lt;/math&gt; of module categories, this notion is equivalent to the familiar notion of [[Finitely generated module|finitely generated modules]].) A Grothendieck category need not contain any non-zero finitely generated objects. A Grothendieck category is called ''locally finitely generated'' if it has a set of finitely generated generators. In such a category, every object is the sum of its finitely generated subobjects.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

It is a rather deep result that every Grothendieck category &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{A}&lt;/math&gt; is [[Complete category|complete]], i.e. that arbitrary [[limit (category theory)|limit]]s (and in particular [[product (category theory)|product]]s) exist in &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{A}&lt;/math&gt;. By contrast, it follows directly from the definition that &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{A}&lt;/math&gt; is co-complete, i.e. that arbitrary [[limit (category theory)|colimits]] and [[coproduct]]s (direct sums) exist in &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{A}&lt;/math&gt;. Coproducts in a Grothendieck category are exact (i.e. the coproduct of a family of short exact sequences is again a short exact sequence), but products need not be exact.

A functor &lt;math&gt;F : {\cal A} \to {\cal X}&lt;/math&gt; from a Grothendieck categories &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{A}&lt;/math&gt; to an arbitrary category &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{X}&lt;/math&gt; has a [[Adjoint functors|left adjoint]] if and only if it commutes with all limits, and it has a right adjoint if and only if it commutes with all colimits. This follows from [[Peter J. Freyd|Freyd]]'s s''pecial adjoint functor theorem'' and its dual.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Categories for the Working Mathematician, 2nd edition|last=Lane|first=Saunders Mac|publisher=Springer|year=1978|location=|pages=130|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Gabriel–Popescu theorem]] states that any Grothendieck category &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{A}&lt;/math&gt; is equivalent to a [[full subcategory]] of the category &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{Mod}(R)&lt;/math&gt; of right modules over some unital ring &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt; (which can be taken to be the [[endomorphism ring]] of a generator of &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{A}&lt;/math&gt;), and &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{A}&lt;/math&gt; can be obtained as a [[Quotient_of_an_abelian_category|Gabriel quotient]] of &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{Mod}(R)&lt;/math&gt; by some [[localizing subcategory]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |authors=N. Popesco, P. Gabriel|title=Caractérisation des catégories abéliennes avec générateurs et limites inductives exactes|journal=Comptes Rendus de l'Académie des Sciences|volume=258|year=1964|pages=4188–4190}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As a consequence of Gabriel–Popescu, one can show that every Grothendieck category is [[locally presentable category|locally presentable]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Šťovíček|first=Jan|date=2013-01-01|title=Deconstructibility and the Hill Lemma in Grothendieck categories|url=https://arxiv.org/pdf/1005.3251|journal=Forum Mathematicum|language=en|volume=25|issue=1|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Every small abelian category &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{C}&lt;/math&gt; can be embedded in a Grothendieck category, in the following fashion. The category &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{A}:=\operatorname{Lex}(\mathcal{C}^{op},\mathrm{Ab})&lt;/math&gt; of [[Exact functor|left-exact]] additive (covariant) functors &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{C}^{op}\rightarrow\mathrm{Ab}&lt;/math&gt; (where &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{Ab}&lt;/math&gt; denotes the [[category of abelian groups]]) is a Grothendieck category, and the functor &lt;math&gt;h\colon\mathcal{C}\rightarrow\mathcal{A}&lt;/math&gt;, with &lt;math&gt;C\mapsto h_C=\operatorname{Hom}(-,C)&lt;/math&gt;, is full, faithful and exact. A generator of &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{A}&lt;/math&gt; is given by the coproduct of all &lt;math&gt;h_C&lt;/math&gt;, with &lt;math&gt;C\in\mathcal{C}&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref name="gabriel-these" /&gt; The category &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{A}&lt;/math&gt; is equivalent to the category &lt;math&gt;\text{Ind}(\mathcal C)&lt;/math&gt; of [[Filtered category|ind-objects]] of &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{C}&lt;/math&gt; and the embedding &lt;math&gt;h&lt;/math&gt; corresponds to the natural embedding  &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{C}\to\text{Ind}(\mathcal C)&lt;/math&gt;.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="20725">The establishment of [[industrial ecology]] as field of scientific research is commonly attributed to an article devoted to industrial ecosystems, written by Frosch and Gallopoulos, which appeared in a 1989 special issue of Scientific American.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Frosch | first1 = R.A. | last2 = Gallopoulos | first2 = N.E. | year = 1989 | title = Strategies for Manufacturing | url = | journal = Scientific American | volume = 261 | issue = 3| pages = 144–152 | doi=10.1038/scientificamerican0989-144}}&lt;/ref&gt; Industrial ecology emerged from several earlier ideas and concepts, some of which date back to the 19th century.

== Before the 1960s ==

The term "[[Industrial Ecology|industrial ecology]]" has been used alongside "[[Industrial Symbiosis|industrial symbiosis]]" at least since the 1940s. [[Economic geography]] was perhaps one of the first fields to use these terms. For example, in an article published in 1947, George T. Renner refers to "The General Principle of Industrial Location" as a "Law of Industrial Ecology".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Renner | first1 = G.T. | year = 1947 | title = Geography of Industrial Localization | url = | journal = Economic Geography | volume = 23 | issue = 3| pages = 167–189 | doi=10.2307/141510 | jstor = 141510 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Briefly stated this is:

{{quote|Any industry tends to locate at a point which provides optimum access to its ingredients or component elements. If all these component elements be juxtaposed, the location of the industry is predetermined. If, however, they occur widely separated, the industry is so located as to be most accessible to that element which would be the most expensive or difficult to transport and which, therefore, becomes the locative factor for the industry in question.}}

In the same article the author defines and describes industrial symbiosis:

{{quote|Often the location of an industry cannot be fully understood solely in terms of its locative ingredient elements. There are relationships between industries, sometimes simple, but often quite complex, which enter into and complicate the analysis. Chief among these is the phenomenon of [[industrial symbiosis]]. By this is meant the consorting together of two or more of dissimilar industries. Industrial Symbiosis, when scrutinized, is seen to be of two kinds, disjunctive and conjunctive.}}

It appears that the concept of Industrial Symbiosis was not new for the field of economic geography, since the same categorization is used by Walter G. Lezius in his 1937 article "Geography of Glass Manufacture at Toledo, Ohio", also published in the Journal of Economic Geography.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Lezius | first1 = Walter G | year = 1937 | title = Geography of Glass Manufacture at Toledo, Ohio | jstor = 141587| journal = Economic Geography | volume = 13 | issue = 4| pages = 402–412 | doi=10.2307/141587}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Used in a different context, the term "Industrial Ecology" is also found in a 1958 paper concerned with the relationship between the ecological impact from increasing urbanization and value orientations of related peoples. The case study is in Lebanon:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Armstrong | first1 = L. | last2 = Bashshur | first2 = R. | year = 1958 | title = Ecological Patterns and Value Orientations in Lebanon | journal = Public Opinion Quarterly | volume = 22 | issue = 3| pages = 406–415 | jstor=2746350 | doi = 10.1086/266808 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|The central ecological variable in the present research is ecological mobility, or the movement of men in space. It is patent that modern Industrial Ecology requires more such adaptive mobility than does traditional folk-village organization.}}

== 1960s ==

In 1963, we find the term Industrial Ecology (defined as the "complex ecology of the modern industrial world") being used to describe the social nature and complexity of (and within) industrial systems:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Barnard | first1 = F | year = 1963 | title = Education for management conceived as a study of Industrial Ecology | journal = Journal of Vocational Education &amp; Training | volume = 15 | issue = 30| pages = 22–26 | doi=10.1080/03057876380000041}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|...industrial organisations are social rather than mechanical systems. A firm is not only a working organisation with a working purpose. It is rather a community with its own 'politics', in so far as it is involved in problems concerned with the proper distribution of power between individuals and groups of individuals and with questions of individual and group prestige, influence, status and standing... [and he concludes that] the understanding which the student of management is expected to gain is no less than the attainment of insight into an [[Industrial Ecology]] of great complexity.}}

In 1967, the President of the American association for the advancement of science writes in "The experimental city"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Spilhaus |first1=Athelstan |year=1967 |title=The experimental city |journal=Daedalus |volume=96 |issue=4 |pages=1129–41 |jstor=20027108 }}&lt;/ref&gt; that "There are examples of [[industrial symbiosis]] where one industry feeds off, or at least neutralizes, the wastes of another..." The same author in 1970 talks about "The Next Industrial Revolution"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1126/science.167.3926.1673 |pmid=17729610 |title=The Next Industrial Revolution |journal=Science |volume=167 |issue=3926 |pages=1673 |year=1970 |last1=Spilhaus |first1=A. }}&lt;/ref&gt; The concept of material and energy sharing and reuse is central to his proposal for a new industrial revolution and he cites agro-[[industrial symbiosis]] as a practical way for achieving this:

{{quote|The object of the next industrial revolution is to ensure that there will be no such thing as waste, on the basis that waste is simply some substance that we do not vet have the wit to use... The next industrial revolution is this generating of a huge new [industry that]... will not produce products, it will rather reprocess the things we call wastes so they may be reproduced in the factories into the things we need... Having the city near the rural area will enable waste heat to be used to speed up the biological processes of treating the organic wastes before they go back into the land. This might end in an elegant arrangement-the power plants located close enough to the center of use, to the people who need the power, but also, within the economics, close enough to the agriculture lands so that the waste heat may be used there. This is an example of agro-industrial symbiosis, if you like to call it that.}}

In these early articles, "Industrial Ecology" is used in its literal sense - as a system of interacting industrial entities. The relation to natural ecosystems (through either metaphor or analogy) is not explicit. Industrial Symbiosis on the other hand, is already clearly defined as a type of industrial organization, and the term symbiosis is borrowed from the ecological sciences to describe an analogous phenomenon in industrial systems.

== 1970s ==

Industrial Ecology has been a research subject of the Japan Industrial Policy Research Institute since 1971. Their definition of Industrial Ecology is "research for the prospect of dynamic harmonization between human activities and nature by a systems approach based upon ecology (JIPRI, 1983)".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Ogawa | first1 = H. | last2 = Sato | first2 = K. | last3 = Jo | first3 = N. | last4 = Noro | first4 = K. | last5 = Tsuchiya | first5 = K. | year = 1986 | title = Modelling of industrial ecological systems for evaluation of health services | journal = Ecological Modelling | volume = 31 | issue = 1–4| pages = 329–339 | doi=10.1016/0304-3800(86)90073-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; This programme has resulted to a number of reports that are available only in Japanese.

One of the earliest definitions of  Industrial Ecology was proposed by Harry Zvi Evan at a seminar of the Economic Commission of Europe in Warsaw (Poland) in 1973 (an article was subsequently published by Evan in the Journal for International Labour Review in 1974 vol. 110 (3), pp.&amp;nbsp;219–233). Evan defined Industrial Ecology as a systematic analysis of industrial operations including factors like: Technology, environment, natural resources, bio-medical aspects, institutional and legal matters as well as the socio-economic aspects.

In 1974 the term of Industrial Ecology is perhaps for the first time associated with a cyclical production mode (rather than a linear one, resulting to waste). In this article, the necessity for a transition to an "open-world Industrial Ecology", is used as argument for the need to establish lunar industries:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Ehricke | first1 = K.A. | year = 1974 | title = Lunar industries and their value for the human environment on Earth | journal = Acta Astronautica | volume = 1 | issue = 5–6| pages = 585–622 | doi=10.1016/0094-5765(74)90023-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|Low living standards provide one strong motive for most developing countries to increase their productivity and grow economically. Population increase (while it lasts) is a still more powerful driver for increased world consumption. Thus the pressure on resources will continue to grow. Instead of deploring it, we better grow with it. Only through transition to an open-world [[Industrial Ecology]] - which includes both benign industrial revolution on Earth and extraterrestrial industrialization - can the present apparent limits to growth be overcome.}}

Many elements of modern Industrial Ecology were commonplace in the industrial sectors of the former Soviet Union.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Sathre | first1 = R. | last2 = Grdzelishvili | first2 = I. | year = 2006 | title = Industrial symbiosis in the former Soviet Union | url = | journal = Progress in Industrial Ecology | volume = 3 | issue = 4| pages = 379–392 | doi=10.1504/pie.2006.011743}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, “kombinirovanaia produksia” (combined production) was present from the earliest years of the Soviet Union and was instrumental in shaping the patterns of Soviet industrialization. “Bezotkhodnoyi tekhnologii” (waste-free technology) was introduced in the final decades of the USSR as a way to increase industrial production while limiting environmental impact. Fiodor Davitaya, a Soviet scientist from the [[Georgian Soviet Socialist Republic|Republic of Georgia]], described in 1977 the analogy relating industrial systems to natural systems as a model for a desirable transition to cleaner production:

{{quote|Nature operates without any waste products. What is rejected by some organisms provides food for others. The organisation of industry on this principle—with the waste products of some branches of industry providing raw material for others—means in effect using natural processes as a model, for in them the resolution of all arising contradictions is the motive force of progress.&lt;ref&gt;Davitaya, F. (1977) "Changes in the atmosphere and some problems of its protection" pp. 99–110 in ''Society and the Environment: A Soviet View''; Moscow: Progress Publishers.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

== 1980s ==

By the 80s Industrial Ecology was already "promoted" to a research subject, which several institutes around the globe embraced. In a 1986 article published in the Journal of Ecological Modeling, there is a full description of Industrial Ecology and the [[analogy]] to natural [[ecosystems]] is clearly stated:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Ogawa | first1 = H. | last2 = Sato | first2 = K. | last3 = Jo | first3 = N. | last4 = Noro | first4 = K. | last5 = Tsuchiya | first5 = K. | year = 1986 | title = Modelling of industrial ecological systems for evaluation of health services | journal = Ecological Modelling | volume = 31 | issue = 1–4| pages = 329–339 | doi=10.1016/0304-3800(86)90073-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|The structure and inner-working of an industrial society resemble those of a natural ecosystem. The concepts in ecology such as habitat, succession, trophic level, limiting factors and community metabolism can also apply to the study of the ecology of an industrial society. For instance, an industry in a society may grow or decline as a consequence of dynamic changes in exogenous limiting resources and in the hierarchical and/or metabolic structure of that society. When studying the ecology of an industrial society (henceforth termed '[[Industrial Ecology]]'), these concepts and methodologies employed in ecosystems analyses are useful.}}

In fact, in the above article there is an attempt to model an "industrial ecological system". The model is composed of seven major sections: industry, population, labor force, living state, environment and pollution, general health, and occupational health. Notice the rough similarity with Evan's factors as stated in the above section.

During the 80s the emergence of another related term, "[[industrial metabolism]]", is observed. The term is used as a metaphor for the organization and functioning of industrial activity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Hicks | first1 =  | year = 1983 | title = The Property Tax in a New Industrial Era | jstor = 3700958| journal = Proceedings of the Academy of Political Science | volume = 35 | issue = 1| pages =  208–221| doi=10.2307/3700958}}&lt;/ref&gt; In an article defending the "biological modulation of terrestrial carbon cycle", the author includes an extraordinary parenthetical note:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Schidlowski | first1 = M | year = 1984 | title = Biological modulation of the terrestrial carbon cycle: isotope clues to early organic evolution | url = | journal = Advances in Space Research | volume = 4 | issue = 12| pages = 183–93 | pmid = 11537773 | doi=10.1016/0273-1177(84)90561-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|Parenthetically, it should be noted that it is an intrinsic property of life to proliferate exponentially until the encounter of limits set by (I) the availability of biologically utilizable reducing power, or (2) the exhaustion of some critical nutrient, or (3) an autotoxic effect imposed by life on its own environment. These limits are universal, applying to microbial ecosystems as well as to the population dynamics of a seemingly unrestricted biological superdominant such as Homo Sapiens (here, the ultimate limit is likely to be placed by an autotoxic effect exerted by the "extrasomatic" (industrial) metabolism of the human race).}}

=== 1989 – Decisive articles ===

In 1989 two articles were released that played a decisive role in the history of industrial ecology. The first one was titled "Industrial Metabolism" by Robert Ayres. Ayres essentially lays the foundations of Industrial Ecology, although the term is not to be found in this article. In the appendix of the article he includes "a theoretical exploration of the biosphere and the industrial economy as material-transformation systems and lessons that might be learned from their comparison". He proposes that:&lt;ref&gt;Ayres, R.U. 1989. Industrial Metabolism. In Technology and Environment,J.H. Ausubel and H.E. Sladovich, 23–49. 1st. Washington DC: National Academy Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|We may think of both the biosphere and the industrial economy as systems for the transformation of materials. The biosphere as it now exists is nearly a perfect system for recycling materials. This was not the case when life on earth began. The industrial system of today resembles the earliest stage of biological evolution, when the most primitive living organisms obtained their energy from a stock of organic molecules accumulated during prebiotic times. It is increasingly urgent for us to learn from the biosphere and modify our industrial metabolism, the energy - and value - yielding process essential to economic development... we should not only postulate, but indeed endorse, a long-run imperative favoring an industrial metabolism that results in reduced extraction of virgin materials, reduced loss of waste materials, and increased recycling of useful ones.}}

The term "Industrial Ecology" gains mainstream attention later the same year (1989) through a "[[Scientific American]]" article named "Strategies for Manufacturing". In this article, R.Frosch and N.Gallopoulos wonder "why would not our industrial system behave like an [[ecosystem]], where the wastes of a species may be [[natural resource|resource]] to another species? Why would not the outputs of an industry be the inputs of another, thus reducing use of raw materials, pollution, and saving on [[waste]] treatment?"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Frosch | first1 = R.A. | last2 = Gallopoulos | first2 = N.E. | year = 1989 | title = Strategies for Manufacturing | url = | journal = Scientific American | volume = 261 | issue = 3| pages = 144–152 | doi=10.1038/scientificamerican0989-144}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This vision gave birth to the concept of the Eco-industrial Park, the industrial complex that is governed by Industrial Ecology principles. A notable example resides in a Danish industrial park in the city of [[Kalundborg]]. There, several linkages of byproducts and waste heat can be found between numerous entities such as a large power plant, an oil refinery, a pharmaceutical plant, a plasterboard factory, an enzyme manufacturer, a waste company and the city itself.&lt;ref&gt;The Kalundborg Centre for [[industrial symbiosis]] (2007) http://www.symbiosis.dk/&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Robert Frosch|Frosch's]] and Gallopoulos' thinking was in certain ways simply an extension of earlier ideas, such as the efficiency and waste-reduction thinking annunciated by [[Buckminster Fuller]] and his students (e.g., [[J. Baldwin]]), and parallel ideas about energy [[cogeneration]], such as those of [[Amory Lovins]] and the [[Rocky Mountain Institute]].

== 1990s ==

In 1991, C. Kumar Patel organized a seminal colloquium on Industrial Ecology, held on May 20 and 21, 1991, at the National Academy of Sciences in Washington D.C. The papers were later published in the [[Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences]] USA, and they form an excellent reference on Industrial Ecology. Papers include:

== 21st century ==

The ''Journal of Industrial Ecology'' (since 1997), the International Society for Industrial Ecology (since 2001), and the journal ''Progress in Industrial Ecology'' (since 2004) have covered [[industrial ecology]] in the international scientific community. Principles of industrial ecology are also emerging in various policy realms such as the concept of the circular economy that is being promoted in China. Although the definition of the circular economy has yet to be formalized, generally the focus is on strategies such as creating a circular flow of materials, and cascading energy flows. An example of this would be using [[waste heat]] from one process to run another process that requires a lower temperature. This maximizes the efficiency of [[exergy]] use. This strategy aims for a more efficient economy with fewer pollutants and other unwanted by-products.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Yuan | first1 = Z | last2 = Bi | first2 = J | last3 = Moriguichi | first3 = Y | year = 2008| title = The Circular Economy: A New Development Strategy in China | url = | journal = Journal of Industrial Ecology | volume = 10 | issue = 1–2| pages = 4–8 | doi=10.1162/108819806775545321}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An '''ideal speech situation''' was a term introduced in the early philosophy of [[Jürgen Habermas]]. It argues that an ideal speech situation is found when [[communication]] between individuals is governed by basic, implied rules. In an ideal speech situation, participants would be able to evaluate each other’s assertions solely on the basis of reason and evidence in an atmosphere completely free of any nonrational “coercive” influences, including both physical and psychological coercion. Furthermore, all participants would be motivated solely by the desire to obtain a rational consensus.
==Doctrines==
Members of the public sphere must adhere to certain rules for an "ideal speech situation" to occur. They are:

1. Every subject with the competence to speak and act is allowed to take part in a discourse.

2a. Everyone is allowed to question any [[Logical assertion|assertion]] whatever.

2b. Everyone is allowed to introduce any assertion whatever into the discourse.

2c. Everyone is allowed to express their attitudes, desires and needs without any hesitation.

3. No speaker may be prevented, by internal or external coercion, from exercising his rights as laid down in (1) and (2)
&lt;ref&gt;Habermas, Jurgen. "Discourse Ethics: Notes on a Program of Philosophical Justification." Moral Consciousness
and Communicative Action. Trans. Christian Lenhart and Shierry Weber Nicholson.
Cambridge: MIT Press, 1990, pp. 43-115.&lt;/ref&gt;

The concept of the ideal speech situation came under attack in the 1970s by theorists who persistently [[Relativism|relativized]] the concept, arguing that any ''particular'' conception of an ideal speech situation could not be proven completely correct, so that any (still-unknown) gaps would allow associated oppressions to arise or persist.

Habermas responded to this in 1983 with ''[[Moral Consciousness and Communicative Action]]'' (English trans. 1990).  In this work he no longer spoke of a known ideal speech situation but instead of a new [[moral philosophy|moral]] system ("Discourse ethics") that could be derived from the "presuppositions of argumentation".  These in turn could ''initially'' be postulated by philosophical analysis in the same way that [[Immanuel Kant]] tried to justify his own moral system through [[transcendental idealism|transcendental]] arguments. However, in contradistinction to Kant, Habermas recognizes that the presuppositions of argumentation can be tested in practice by a device he terms "performative contradiction".  If critics object to the presuppositions of argumentation, their argument ''might'' be turned on them to demonstrate that their argument has already granted the existence of whatever specific presupposition of argument they object to.  However, if such a performative [[contradiction]] cannot be found, then the presuppositions of argumentation must be revised to take account of the criticism and the moral system derived from these presuppositions altered accordingly.  In other words, "performative contradiction" is not a trump card to dismiss all objections but a fair test of those objections.  The [[dialectics|dialectical]] nature of Habermas's argument often goes unrecognized.

==Use in Pragmatics and Speech-Act Analysis==
The ideal speech situation, in its assumption of literal rather than figurative language function (language "below" rather than "above" the context-forming horizon of the lifeworld), is taken as the model for formal [[pragmatics|pragmatic]] analysis of [[speech act|speech-acts]].

[[image:Function-x.svg|thumb|Graph of the identity function on the real numbers]]

In [[mathematics]], an '''identity function''', also called an '''identity relation''' or '''identity map''' or '''identity transformation''', is a [[function (mathematics)|function]] that always returns the same value that was used as its argument. In [[equation]]s, the function is given by {{math|1=''f''(''x'') = ''x''}}.

==Definition==
Formally, if {{math|''M''}} is a [[Set (mathematics)|set]], the identity function {{math|''f''}} on {{math|''M''}} is defined to be that function with [[domain of a function|domain]] and [[codomain]] {{math|''M''}} which satisfies
:{{math|1=''f''(''x'') = ''x''}} &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;for all elements {{math|''x''}} in {{math|''M''}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last1=Knapp |first1=Anthony W. |last2= |first2= |title=Basic algebra |url= |edition= |volume= |year=2006 |publisher=Springer |isbn=978-0-8176-3248-9 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In other words, the function value {{math|''f''(''x'')}} in {{math|''M''}} (that is, the codomain) is always the same input element {{math|''x''}} of {{math|''M''}} (now considered as the domain). The identity function on {{mvar|M}} is clearly an [[injective function]] as well as a [[surjective function]], so it is also [[bijection|bijective]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Mapa |first=Sadhan Kumar |date= |title=Higher Algebra Abstract and Linear |url= |edition=11th  |publisher=Sarat Book House |page=36 |isbn=978-93-80663-24-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The identity function {{math|''f''}} on {{math|''M''}} is often denoted by {{math|id&lt;sub&gt;''M''&lt;/sub&gt;}}.

In [[set theory]], where a function is defined as a particular kind of [[binary relation]], the identity function is given by the [[identity relation]], or ''diagonal'' of {{math|''M''}}.

==Algebraic property==
If {{math|''f'' : ''M'' → ''N''}} is any function, then we have {{math|1=''f'' ∘ id&lt;sub&gt;''M''&lt;/sub&gt; = ''f'' = id&lt;sub&gt;''N''&lt;/sub&gt; ∘ ''f''}} (where "∘" denotes [[function composition]]). In particular, {{math|id&lt;sub&gt;''M''&lt;/sub&gt;}} is the [[identity element]] of the [[monoid]] of all functions from {{math|''M''}} to {{math|''M''}}.

Since the identity element of a monoid is [[unique (mathematics)|unique]], one can alternately define the identity function on {{math|''M''}} to be this identity element. Such a definition generalizes to the concept of an [[identity morphism]] in [[category theory]], where the [[endomorphism]]s of {{math|''M''}} need not be functions.

==Properties==
*The identity function is a [[linear map|linear operator]], when applied to [[vector space]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Anton|first=Howard|year=2005|title=Elementary Linear Algebra (Applications Version)|publisher=Wiley International|edition=9th}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*The identity function on the positive [[integer]]s is a [[completely multiplicative function]] (essentially multiplication by 1), considered in [[number theory]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Number Theory through Inquiry|author1=D. Marshall |author2=E. Odell |author3=M. Starbird |year=2007|publisher=Mathematical Assn of Amer|isbn=978-0883857519|series=Mathematical Association of America Textbooks}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
*In an {{math|''n''}}-dimensional [[vector space]] the identity function is represented by the [[identity matrix]] {{math|I&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;}}, regardless of the [[Basis (linear algebra)|basis]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Applied Linear Algebra and Matrix Analysis|author=T. S. Shores|year=2007|publisher=Springer|isbn=038-733-195-6|series=Undergraduate Texts in Mathematics|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8qwTb9P-iW8C&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=Matrix+Analysis&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=SCd1UryWD_LG7Aag_4HwBg&amp;ved=0CGQQ6AEwCA#v=onepage&amp;q=Matrix%20Analysis&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*In a [[metric space]] the identity is trivially an [[isometry]]. An object without any [[symmetry]] has as [[symmetry group]] the trivial group only containing this isometry (symmetry type {{math|''C''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;}}).&lt;ref&gt;{{aut|James W. Anderson}}, ''Hyperbolic Geometry'', Springer 2005, {{isbn|1-85233-934-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*In a [[topological space]], the identity function is always continuous.

'''The International Panel of Parliamentarians for Freedom of Religion or Belief (IPPFoRB)''' is a network of parliamentarians from around the world committed to combating religious persecution and advancing freedom of religion or belief, as defined by Article 18 of the [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://ippforb.com|title=The IPPFoRB's website|last=|first=|date=|website=ippforb.com|language=en-US|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2017-08-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
IPPFoRB was established on 8 November 2014 with the signing of the Oslo Charter for Freedom of Religion or Belief at the [[Nobel Peace Center]] in [[Oslo]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.worldreligionnews.com/issues/30-parliamentarians-meet-oslo-sign-freedom-religion-charter|title=30 Parliamentarians Meet with USCIRF in Oslo to Sign a Freedom of Religion Charter|last=|first=|date=2014-11-13|work=World Religion News|access-date=2017-08-04|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first steering committee of the IPPFoRB was composed of Baroness [[Elizabeth Berridge, Baroness Berridge|Elizabeth Berridge]] (UK [[House of Lords]]), [[David Anderson (Saskatchewan politician)|David Anderson]] ([[House of Commons of Canada]]), [[Abid Raja]] ([[Parliament of Norway]]), [[Aykan Erdemir]] ([[Grand National Assembly of Turkey]]), Leonardo Quintao ([[National Congress of Brazil]]).

== Activities ==

In September 2015, IPPFoRB convened&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.worldwatchmonitor.org/2015/09/religious-freedom-network-should-be-as-outspoken-and-organized-as-the-extremists/|title=Religious freedom network should be as 'outspoken and organized' as the extremists|last=|first=|date=2015-09-22|work=World Watch Monitor|access-date=2017-08-04|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; 100 parliamentarians from 50 countries in [[New York City|New York]], alongside the [[United Nations General Assembly]], and issued the New York Resolution for Freedom of Religion or Belief to "enhance global cooperation by working across geographical, political, and religious lines."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://ippforb.com/new-york-resolution/|title=New York Resolution for Freedom of Religion or Belief|last=|first=|date=|website=IPPFoRB|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2017-08-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the New York meeting, IPPFoRB founder Aykan Erdemir stated that this global network is "idea for which the time is right," adding that people advocating rights should be as "outspoken, organised and transnational" as the violent extremists.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.worldwatchmonitor.org/2015/09/religious-freedom-network-should-be-as-outspoken-and-organized-as-the-extremists/|title=Religious freedom network should be as 'outspoken and organised' as the extremists|last=|first=|date=September 22, 2015|work=World Watch Monitor|access-date=December 15, 2017|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 2016, IPPFoRB assembled 100 parliamentarians from 60 countries in [[Berlin]] with the attendance of German Chancellor [[Angela Merkel]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.worldwatchmonitor.org/2016/09/freedom-of-religion-or-belief-the-defining-issue-of-our-time/|title=Freedom of religion or belief 'the defining issue of our time'|last=|first=|date=|work=World Watch Monitor|access-date=2017-08-04|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since its inception, IPPFoRB parliamentarians have written advocacy letters to heads of state of Burma, Eritrea, Indonesia, Iran, North Korea, Pakistan, Sudan, and Vietnam.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://thehill.com/blogs/congress-blog/religious-rights/305900-legislators-abroad-unite-for-religious-freedom|title=Legislators abroad unite for religious freedom|last=|first=|date=2016-11-14|work=The Hill|access-date=2017-08-04|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

IPPFoRB steering committee members have received awards in recognition of their efforts: Aykan Erdemir was awarded the [[Stefanus Prize]] by the [[Stefanus Alliance International]] in 2015&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.stefanus.no/no/nyheter/norge/2016/Stefanusprisen+2016.b7C_wlLQ2N.ips|title=Stefanusprisen 2016|last=|first=|date=|website=The Stefanus Alliance International|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2017-08-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; while Baroness Elizabeth Berridge is the recipient of the 2017 International Religious Liberty Award of the [[International Center for Law and Religion Studies]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.iclrs.org/index.php?pageId=1&amp;contentId=1&amp;blurbId=86128|title=Baroness Elizabeth Berridge Receives 2017 International Religious Liberty Award|last=|first=|date=|website=International Center for Law and Religion Studies|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2017-12-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Abid Raja]] was named the 2018 recipient of the [[International Religious Liberty Association]]'s International Award for Outstanding Leadership in Religious Freedom Advocacy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.irla.org/norwegian-parliamentarian|title=Norwegian Parliamentarian to be Recognized for Global Efforts to Promote Freedom of Religion or Belief|last=|first=|date=|website=The International Religious Liberty Association|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2017-12-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Nihongo|'''''Kanban'''''|看板}} ([[signboard]] or [[Billboard (advertising)|billboard]] in [[Japanese language|Japanese]]) is a [[Scheduling (production processes)|scheduling]] system for [[lean manufacturing]] and [[just-in-time manufacturing]] (JIT).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/Kanban | title=Kanban | publisher=Dictionary.com | work=Random House Dictionary | year=2011 | accessdate=April 12, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Taiichi Ohno]], an [[industrial engineer]] at [[Toyota]], developed kanban to improve manufacturing efficiency. Kanban is one method to achieve JIT.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last = Ohno |first = Taiichi |authorlink = Taiichi Ohno |title = Toyota Production System - beyond large-scale production  |publisher = Productivity Press |date = June 1988| pages = 29 |isbn = 0-915299-14-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; The system takes its name from the cards that track production within a factory. For many in the automotive sector, kanban is known as the "Toyota nameplate system" and as such the term is not used by some other automakers.

Kanban became an effective tool to support running a production system as a whole, and an excellent way to promote improvement. Problem areas are highlighted by measuring lead time and cycle time of the full process and process steps.{{Clarify|date=May 2013}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last = Shingō |first = Shigeo | authorlink = Shigeo Shingo |title = A Study of the Toyota Production System from an Industrial Engineering Viewpoint |publisher = Productivity Press |year = 1989| pages = 228 |isbn = 0-915299-17-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; One of the main benefits of kanban is to establish an upper limit to [[work in process]] inventory to avoid overcapacity. Other systems with similar effect are for example [[CONWIP]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last = Hopp|first = Wallace J.|title = To Pull or Not to Pull: What Is the Question? |journal = Manufacturing &amp; Service Operations Management|date = Spring 2004| pages = 133}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A systematic study of various configurations of kanban systems, of which CONWIP is an important special case, can be found in Tayur (1993), among other papers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1287/mnsc.39.11.1347 | title = Structural Properties and a Heuristic for Kanban-Controlled Serial Lines | journal = Management Science| last = Tayur | first = Sridhar | year = 1993 | volume = 39 | number = 11 | pages = 1347–1368}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1080/07408179508936726 | journal = IIE Transactions | last1=   Muckstadt | first1= John | last2=Tayur | first2=Sridhar|title =A comparison of alternative kanban control mechanisms.

A goal of the kanban system is to limit the buildup of excess inventory at any point in production. Limits on the number of items waiting at supply points are established and then reduced as inefficiencies are identified and removed. Whenever a limit is exceeded, this points to an inefficiency that should be addressed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=R.J. |last=Schonberger |year=2001 |title=Let's Fix It! Overcoming the Crisis in Manufacturing |location=New York |publisher=Free Press |pages=70–71}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origins==
The system originates from the simplest visual stock replenishment signaling system, an empty box. This was first developed in the UK Spitfire factories during the war and was known as the “two bin system.” In the late 1940s, Toyota started studying [[supermarket]]s with the idea of applying shelf-stocking techniques to the factory floor. In a supermarket, customers generally retrieve what they need at the required time—no more, no less. Furthermore, the supermarket stocks only what it expects to sell in a given time, and customers take only what they need, because future supply is assured. This observation led Toyota to view a process as being a customer of one or more preceding processes and to view the preceding processes as a kind of store.

Kanban aligns inventory levels with actual consumption. A signal tells a supplier to produce and deliver a new shipment when a material is consumed. This [[Demand signal|signal]] is tracked through the replenishment cycle, bringing visibility to the supplier, consumer, and buyer.

Kanban uses the rate of demand to control the rate of production, passing demand from the end customer up through the chain of customer-store processes. In 1953, Toyota applied this logic in their main plant machine shop.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last = Ohno |first = Taiichi |authorlink = Taiichi Ohno |title = Toyota Production  - beyond large-scale production |publisher = Productivity Press |date = June 1988| pages = 25–28 |isbn = 0-915299-14-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Operation==
A key indicator of the success of production scheduling based on demand, ''pushing,'' is the ability of the [[demand forecasting|demand-forecast]] to create such a ''[[Push–pull strategy|push]]''. Kanban, by contrast, is part of an approach where the [[Push–pull strategy|''pull'']] comes from demand and products are [[Build to order|made to order]]. Re-supply or production is determined according to customer orders.

In contexts where supply time is lengthy and demand is difficult to forecast, often, the best one can do is to respond quickly to observed demand. This situation is exactly what a kanban system accomplishes, in that it is used as a demand signal that immediately travels through the supply chain. This ensures that intermediate stock held in the supply chain are better managed, and are usually smaller. Where the supply response is not quick enough to meet actual demand fluctuations, thereby causing potential lost sales, a stock building may be deemed more appropriate and is achieved by placing more kanban in the system.

Taiichi Ohno stated that to be effective, kanban must follow strict rules of use.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last = Shingō |first = Shigeo |authorlink = Shigeo Shingo |title = A Study of the Toyota Production System from an Industrial Engineering Viewpoint |publisher = Productivity Press |year = 1989| pages = 30 |isbn = 0-915299-17-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Toyota, for example, has six simple rules, and close monitoring of these rules is a never-ending task, thereby ensuring that the kanban does what is required.

===Toyota's Six Rules===
[[Toyota]] has formulated six rules for the application of kanban:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last = Ohno |first = Taiichi |authorlink = Taiichi Ohno |title = Toyota Production System: Beyond Large-Scale Production |publisher = Productivity Press |year = 1988| pages = 176|isbn = 9780915299140}}&lt;/ref&gt;
# Each process issues requests (kanban) to its suppliers as it consumes its supplies.
# Each process produces according to the quantity and sequence of incoming requests.
# No items are made or transported without a request.
# The request associated with an item is always attached to it.
# Processes must not send out defective items, to ensure that finished products will be defect-free.
# Limiting the number of pending requests makes the process more sensitive and reveals inefficiencies.

===Kanban (cards)===
Kanban cards are a key component of kanban and they signal the need to move materials within a production facility or to move materials from an outside supplier into the production facility. The kanban card is, in effect, a message that signals a depletion of product, parts, or inventory. When received, the kanban triggers replenishment of that product, part, or inventory.  Consumption, therefore, drives demand for more production, and the kanban card signals demand for more product—so kanban cards help create a demand-driven system.

It is widely held{{Citation needed|date=July 2011}} by proponents of [[lean production]] and manufacturing that demand-driven systems lead to faster turnarounds in production and lower inventory levels, helping companies implementing such systems be more competitive.

In the last few years, systems sending kanban signals electronically have become more widespread. While this trend is leading to a reduction in the use of kanban cards in aggregate, it is still common in modern lean production facilities to find the use of kanban cards.  In various software systems, kanban is used for signalling demand to suppliers through email notifications.  When stock of a particular component is depleted by the quantity assigned on kanban card, a "kanban trigger" is created (which may be manual or automatic), a purchase order is released with predefined quantity for the supplier defined on the card, and the supplier is expected to dispatch material within a specified lead-time.&lt;ref name=JDEdwards&gt;{{cite book|title=JD Edwards EnterpriseOne Kanban Management 9.0 Implementation Guide|publisher=[[JD Edwards]]|chapter-url=http://docs.oracle.com/cd/E15156_01/e1apps90pbr0/eng/psbooks/1akm/chapter.htm?File=1akm/htm/1akm04.htm|accessdate=26 February 2015|chapter=Setting Up Kanban Management}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Kanban cards, in keeping with the principles of kanban, simply convey the need for more materials. A red card lying in an empty parts cart conveys that more parts are needed.

===Three-bin system===
An example of a simple kanban system implementation is a "three-bin system" for the supplied parts, where there is no in-house manufacturing. One bin is on the factory floor (the initial demand point), one bin is in the factory store (the inventory control point), and one bin is at the supplier. The bins usually have a removable card containing the product details and other relevant information—the classic kanban card.

When the bin on the factory floor is empty (because the parts in it were used up in a manufacturing process), the empty bin and its kanban card are returned to the factory store (the inventory control point). The factory store replaces the empty bin on the factory floor with the full bin from the factory store, which also contains a kanban card. The factory store sends the empty bin with its kanban card to the supplier. The supplier's full product bin, with its kanban card, is delivered to the factory store; the supplier keeps the empty bin.  This is the final step in the process.  Thus, the process never runs out of product—and could be described as a closed loop, in that it provides the exact amount required, with only one spare bin so there is never oversupply. This 'spare' bin allows for uncertainties in supply, use, and transport in the inventory system. A good kanban system calculates just enough kanban cards for each product. Most factories that use kanban use the coloured board system ([[heijunka box]]).

==Electronic kanban==
Many manufacturers have implemented '''electronic kanban''' (sometimes referred to as E-kanban&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://archive.li/sxld3#selection-335.0-280.1|work=Momentum, the midsize business center newsletter |title=Taking control of costs |publisher=Microsoft}}{{dead link|date=September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;) systems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Vernyi |first=Bruce |author2=Vinas, Tonya |title=Easing into E-Kanban |date=December 1, 2005 |accessdate=April 12, 2008 |journal=IndustryWeek |url=http://www.industryweek.com/ReadArticle.aspx?ArticleID=11009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060316091741/http://www.industryweek.com/ReadArticle.aspx?ArticleID=11009 |archivedate=March 16, 2006 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; These help to eliminate common problems such as manual entry errors and lost cards.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Drickhamer |first=David |date=March 2005 |title=The Kanban E-volution |journal=Material Handling Management |pages=24–26 |url=http://www.mhmonline.com/viewStory.asp?nID=3950&amp;S=1 }}{{dead link|date=September 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; E-kanban systems can be integrated into [[enterprise resource planning]] (ERP) systems, enabling real-time demand signaling across the supply chain and improved visibility. Data pulled from E-kanban systems can be used to optimize inventory levels by better tracking supplier lead and replenishment times.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Cutler |first=Thomas R. |title=Examining Lean Manufacturing Promise |date=September 2006 |accessdate=January 29, 2013 |journal=SoftwareMag.com |url=http://www.softwaremag.com/content/ContentCT.asp?P=3193 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130526100928/http://www.softwaremag.com/content/ContentCT.asp?P=3193 |archivedate=May 26, 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

E-kanban is a signaling system that uses a mix of technology to trigger the movement of materials within a manufacturing or production facility.  Electronic Kanban differs from traditional kanban in that it uses technology to replace traditional elements such as kanban cards with [[barcode]]s and electronic messages such as [[email]] or [[Electronic data interchange]].

A typical electronic kanban system marks inventory with barcodes, which workers scan at various stages of the manufacturing process to signal usage. The scans relay messages to internal/external stores to ensure the restocking of products. Electronic kanban often uses the internet as a method of routing messages to external suppliers&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=International Manufacturing Strategies: Context, Content and Change |editor-first2=Christopher A. |editor-last2=Voss |editor-first3=Kathryn L. |editor-last3=Blackmon |editor-first1=Per |editor-last1=Lindberg |isbn=0-7923-8061-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; and as a means to allow a real-time view of inventory, via a portal, throughout the supply chain.

Organizations such as the [[Ford Motor Company]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Visual Tools: Collected Practices and Cases |publisher=Productivity Press |isbn=1-56327-331-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Bombardier Aerospace]] have used electronic kanban systems to improve processes. Systems are now widespread from single solutions or bolt on modules to [[ERP system]]s.

==Types of kanban systems==
In a kanban system, adjacent upstream and downstream workstations communicate with each other through their cards, where each container has a kanban associated with it. Economic Order Quantity is important. The
two most important types of kanbans are:
* Production (P) Kanban: A P-kanban, when received, authorizes the workstation to produce a fixed amount of products. The P-kanban is carried on the containers that are associated with it.
* Transportation (T) Kanban: A T-kanban authorizes the transportation of the full container to the downstream workstation. The T-kanban is also carried on the containers that are associated with the transportation to move through the loop again.

==Etymology==
[[File:Kawaii lolita manga.jpg|thumb|left|Cute manga drawing using kawaii basis (illustration by Daya Wyrd)]]
The word ''kawaii'' originally derives from the phrase {{lang|ja|[[:wikt:顔映し|顔映し]]}} ''kao hayushi'', which literally means "(one's) face (is) aglow," commonly used to refer to flushing or blushing of the face. The second morpheme is [[cognate]] with ''-bayu'' in [https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/%E7%9C%A9%E3%81%84 ''mabayui''] (眩い, 目映い, or 目映ゆい) "dazzling, glaring, blinding, too bright; dazzlingly beautiful" (''ma-'' is from 目 ''me'' "eye") and ''-hayu'' in ''omohayui'' (面映い or 面映ゆい) "embarrassed/embarrassing, awkward, feeling self-conscious/making one feel self-conscious" (''omo-'' is from 面 ''omo'', an archaic word for "face, looks, features; surface; image, semblance, vestige"). Over time, the meaning changed into the modern meaning of "cute", and the pronunciation changed to {{lang|ja|かわゆい}} ''kawayui'' and then to the modern {{lang|ja|かわいい}} ''kawaii''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|script-title=ja:かわいい|work = 語源由来辞典 (Dictionary of Etymology) |language=Japanese|url=http://gogen-allguide.com/ka/kawaii.html |accessdate = 20 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|script-title=ja:可愛い|work = デジタル大辞泉 (Digital Daijisen) |language=Japanese|url=http://dictionary.goo.ne.jp/leaf/jn2/46843/m0u/%E5%8F%AF%E6%84%9B%E3%81%84/ |accessdate = 20 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|script-title=ja:可愛いとは|work = 大辞林第3版(Daijirin 3rd Ed.) |language=Japanese|url=http://kotobank.jp/word/%E5%8F%AF%E6%84%9B%E3%81%84 |accessdate = 20 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is most commonly written in [[hiragana]], {{lang|ja|かわいい}}, but the [[ateji]], {{lang|ja|可愛い}}, has also been appended. The [[kanji]] in the ateji literally translates to "able to be loved, can/may love, lovable."

==History==
===Original definition===
[[File:JapaneseSchoolGirl-Sobuline-2011.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Kogal]] girl, identified by her shortened skirt. The soft bag and teddy bear that she carries are part of ''kawaii''.]]
The original definition of ''kawaii'' came from Lady Murasaki's ''[[The Tale of Genji]]'', where it referred to pitiable qualities.&lt;ref name="Shiokawa" /&gt; During the Shogunate period under the ideology of neo-Confucianism, women came to be included under the term ''kawaii'' as the perception of women being animalistic was replaced with the conception of women as docile.&lt;ref name="Shiokawa" /&gt; However, the earlier meaning survives in the modern Standard Japanese adjectival noun かわいそう ''kawaisō'' (often written with ''ateji'' as 可哀相 or 可哀想) "piteous, pitiable, arousing compassion, poor, sad, sorry" (etymologically from 顔映様 "face / projecting, reflecting, or transmitting light, flushing, [[blushing]] / seeming, appearance"). Forms of ''kawaii'' and its derivatives ''kawaisō'' and ''kawairashii'' (with the suffix ''-rashii'' "-like, -ly") are used in modern dialects to mean "embarrassing/embarrassed, shameful/ashamed" or "good, nice, fine, excellent, superb, splendid, admirable" in addition to the standard meanings of "adorable" and "pitiable."

===Cute handwriting===
The rise of [[cuteness]] in [[Japanese culture]] emerged in the 1970s as part of a new style of writing.&lt;ref name="kinsella"&gt;Kinsella, Sharon. 1995. "Cuties in Japan" [http://www.kinsellaresearch.com/new/Cuties%20in%20Japan.pdf] accessed August 1, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; Many teenage girls began to write laterally using [[mechanical pencil]]s.&lt;ref name=kinsella/&gt; These pencils produced very fine lines, as opposed to traditional [[Japanese writing]] that varied in thickness and was vertical.&lt;ref name=kinsella/&gt; The girls would also write in big, round characters and they added little pictures to their writing, such as hearts, stars, emoticon faces, and letters of the Latin alphabet.&lt;ref name=kinsella/&gt;

These pictures would be inserted randomly and made the writing difficult to read.&lt;ref name=kinsella/&gt; As a result, this writing style caused a lot of controversy and was banned in many schools.&lt;ref name=kinsella/&gt; During the 1980s, however, this new "cute" writing was adopted by [[magazines]] and [[comics]] and was put onto packaging and advertising.&lt;ref name=kinsella/&gt;

From 1984 to 1986, {{nihongo|Kazuma Yamane|山根一眞|Yamane Kazuma}} studied the development of cute handwriting, which he called Anomalous Female Teenage Handwriting, in depth.&lt;ref name=kinsella/&gt; This type of cute Japanese handwriting has also been called: {{nihongo|marui ji|[[:wikt:丸い|丸い]][[:wikt:字|字]]}}, meaning "round writing", {{nihongo|koneko ji|[[:wikt:小猫|小猫]]字}}, meaning "kitten writing", {{nihongo|manga ji|[[:wikt:漫画|漫画]]字}}, meaning "comic writing", and {{nihongo|burikko ji|[[:wikt:鰤|鰤]][[:wikt:子|子]]字}}, meaning "fake-child writing".&lt;ref&gt;Skov, L. (1995). Women, media, and consumption in [[Japan]]. Hawai'i Press, USA.&lt;/ref&gt; Although it was commonly thought that the writing style was something that teenagers had picked up from [[comics]], he found that teenagers had come up with the style themselves, spontaneously, as an underground trend. His conclusion was based on an observation that cute handwriting predates the availability of technical means for producing rounded writing in comics.&lt;ref name=kinsella/&gt;

===Cute merchandise===
[[File:Japanese kawaii doll.jpg|thumb|left|''Kawaii'' doll]]
{{nihongo|Tomoyuki Sugiyama|杉山奉文|Sugiyama Tomoyuki}}, author of Cool Japan, says cute fashion in Japan can be traced back to the [[Edo period]] with the popularity of [[netsuke]].&lt;ref name="theage"&gt;''TheAge.Com:'' "Japan smitten by love of cute" http://www.theage.com.au/news/people/cool-or-infantile/2006/06/18/1150569208424.html&lt;/ref&gt;

Because of this growing trend, companies such as [[Sanrio]] came out with merchandise like [[Hello Kitty]]. Hello Kitty was an immediate success and the obsession with cute continued to progress in other areas as well. More recently, Sanrio has released kawaii characters with deeper personalities that appeal to an older audience, such as [[Gudetama]] and [[Aggretsuko]]. These characters have enjoyed strong popularity as fans are drawn to their unique quirks in addition to their cute aesthetics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The New Breed of Kawaii – Characters Who Get Us|url=https://www.umamibrain.com/single-post/2017/09/18/The-New-Breed-of-Kawaii-%25E2%2580%2593-Characters-Who-Get-Us|website=UmamiBrain|accessdate=29 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 1980s also saw the rise of cute idols, such as [[Seiko Matsuda]], who is largely credited with popularizing the trend. Women began to emulate Seiko Matsuda and her cute fashion style and mannerisms, which emphasized the helplessness and innocence of young girls.&lt;ref&gt;See {{cite web |url=http://www.jref.com/forum/showthread.php?t=16924 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-02-12 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101124094006/http://jref.com/forum/showthread.php?t=16924 |archivedate=2010-11-24 |df= }} URL accessed February 11, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; The market for cute merchandise in Japan used to be driven by Japanese girls between 15 and 18 years old.&lt;ref&gt;''Time Asia'': Young Japan: She's a material girl http://www.time.com/time/asia/asia/magazine/1999/990503/style1.html&lt;/ref&gt; No longer limited to teenagers, the spread of making things as cute as possible, even common household items, is embraced by people of all ages.

==Aesthetics==

{{nihongo|Soichi Masubuchi|増淵宗一|Masubuchi Sōichi}}, in his work ''Kawaii Syndrome'', claims "cute" and "neat" have taken precedence over the former Japanese aesthetics of "beautiful" and "refined".&lt;ref name="Shiokawa"&gt;Shiokawa.

Bowling Green, Kentucky: Bowling Green State University Popular Press, 1999. 93–125. {{ISBN|0-87972-779-9}}.&lt;/ref&gt; As a cultural phenomenon, [[cuteness]] is increasingly accepted in Japan as a part of [[Japanese culture]] and national identity. {{nihongo|Tomoyuki Sugiyama|杉山奉文|Sugiyama Tomoyuki}}, author of ''[[Cool Japan]]'', believes that "cuteness" is rooted in Japan's harmony-loving culture, and {{nihongo|Nobuyoshi Kurita|栗田経惟|Kurita Nobuyoshi}}, a sociology professor at [[Musashi University]] in [[Tokyo]], has stated that "cute" is a "magic term" that encompasses everything that is acceptable and desirable in Japan.&lt;ref name=ap2006&gt;Quotes and paraphrases from: {{cite news|title=Cuteness a hot-selling commodity in Japan|author=Yuri Kageyama|date=June 14, 2006|publisher=[[Associated Press]]|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/06/14/AR2006061401122.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Gender performance===
Japanese women who feign kawaii behaviors (e.g., high-pitched voice, squealing giggles&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Merry White|title=The material child: coming of age in Japan and America|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vom1N-653voC&amp;pg=PA129|accessdate=19 July 2011|date=29 September 1994|publisher=University of California Press|isbn=978-0-520-08940-2|pages=129}}&lt;/ref&gt;) that could be viewed as forced or inauthentic are called ''[[burikko]]'' and this is considered a [[Gender performativity|gender performance]].&lt;ref name="Miller"&gt;"You are doing ''burikko''!: Censoring/scrutinizing artificers of cute femininity in Japanese," Laura Miller in ''Japanese Language, Gender, and Ideology: Cultural Models and Real People'', edited by Janet Shibamoto Smith and Shigeko Okamoto, Oxford University Press, 2004. In Japanese.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[neologism]] developed in the 1980s, perhaps originated by comedian {{nihongo|Kuniko Yamada|山田邦子|Yamada Kuniko}}.&lt;ref name="Miller" /&gt;

===Physical attractiveness===
In Japan, being cute is acceptable for both men and women. A trend existed of men shaving their legs to mimic the [[Neoteny|neotenic]] look. Japanese women often try to act cute to attract men.&lt;ref name="Bremmer" /&gt; A study by Kanebo, a cosmetic company, found that Japanese women in their 20s and 30s favored the "cute look" with a "childish round face".&lt;ref name="theage" /&gt; Women also employ a look of innocence in order to further play out this idea of cuteness. Having large eyes is one aspect that exemplifies innocence; therefore many Japanese women attempt to alter the size of their eyes. To create this illusion, women may wear large [[contact lens]]es, [[false eyelashes]], dramatic eye makeup, and even have an [[East Asian blepharoplasty]], commonly known as double eyelid surgery.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=RiRi|first=Madame|title=Some Japanese customs that may confuse foreigners.|url=http://www.japantoday.com/category/lifestyle/view/some-japanese-customs-that-may-confuse-foreigners|publisher=Japan Today|accessdate=25 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Idols===
[[File:Japan Expo 2012 (3).jpg|thumb|[[Momoiro Clover Z]] performing at [[Japan Expo]]]]
{{nihongo|[[Japanese idol|Idols]]|アイドル|aidoru}} are media personalities in their teens and twenties who are considered particularly attractive or cute and who will, for a period ranging from several months to a few years, regularly appear in the mass media, e.g. as singers for [[Pop music|pop]] groups, bit-part actors, TV personalities (''[[tarento]]''), models in photo spreads published in magazines, advertisements, etc. (But not every young celebrity is considered an idol. Young celebrities who wish to cultivate a rebellious image, such as many rock musicians, reject the "idol" label.) [[Speed (Japanese band)|Speed]], [[Morning Musume]], [[AKB48]], and [[Momoiro Clover Z]] are examples of popular idol groups in Japan during the 2000s &amp; 2010s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ajw.asahi.com/article/cool_japan/culture/aj201208290008 |title=Momoiro Clover Z dazzles audiences with shiny messages of hope |work=[[The Asahi Shimbun]] |date=2012-08-29 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131024003154/http://ajw.asahi.com/article/cool_japan/culture/AJ201208290008 |archivedate=2013-10-24 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cute fashion===
====Lolita====
[[File:Pink gothlolita.jpg|thumb|upright|left|[[Sweet Lolita]] fashion in Japan]]
[[Lolita fashion]] is a very well-known and recognizable style in Japan. Based on Victorian fashion and the [[Rococo]] period, girls mix in their own elements along with gothic style to achieve the porcelain-doll look.&lt;ref name="Fort 2010"&gt;{{cite book|last=Fort|first=Emeline|title=A Guide to Japanese Street Fashion|year=2010|publisher=6 Degrees}}&lt;/ref&gt; The girls who dress in Lolita fashion try to look cute, innocent, and beautiful.&lt;ref name="Fort 2010"/&gt; This look is achieved with lace, ribbons, bows, ruffles, bloomers, aprons, and ruffled petticoats. Parasols, chunky Mary Jane heels, and Bo Peep collars are also very popular.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Holson|first=Laura|title=Gothic Lolitas: Demure vs. Dominatrix|newspaper=New York Times|date=13 March 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Sweet Lolita]] is a subset of Lolita fashion that includes even more ribbons, bows, and lace, and is often fabricated out of pastels and other light colors. Another subset of Lolita fashion related to "sweet Lolita" is Fairy Kei. Head-dresses such as giant bows or bonnets are also very common, while lighter make-up is also used to achieve a more natural look. Curled hair extensions, sometimes accompanied by eyelash extensions, are also popular in helping with the baby doll look.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{cite book|last=Fort|first=Emmeline|title=A Guide to Japanese Street Fashion|year=2010|publisher=6 Degrees}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Themes such as fruits, flowers and sweets are often used as patterns on the fabrics used for dresses. Purses often go with the themes and are shaped as hearts, strawberries, or stuffed animals. ''Baby, the Stars Shine Bright'' is one of the more popular clothing stores for this style and often carries themes. Mannerisms are also important to many Sweet Lolitas. Sweet Lolita is not only a fashion, but also a lifestyle.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; This is evident in the 2004 film ''[[Kamikaze Girls]]'' where the main Lolita character, Momoko, drinks only tea and eats only sweets.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Mitani|first=Koki|title=Kamikaze Girls|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0416220/|publisher=IMDB}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Decora====
[[File:Rainbow Decora.jpg|thumb|upright|Example of Decora fashion]]
Decora is a style that is characterized by wearing lots of "decorations" on oneself. It is considered to be self-decoration. The goal of this fashion is to become as vibrant and characterized as possible. People who take part in this fashion trend wear accessories such as multicolor hair pins, bracelets, rings, necklaces, etc. By adding on multiple layers of accessories on an outfit, the fashion trend tends to have a childlike appearance. It also includes toys and multicolor clothes.

====Kawaii men====
Although kawaii is typically a female-dominated fashion, there are men who decide to partake in this trend. Some men decide to transform themselves into women, more specifically kawaii women. They are able to transform themselves by wearing wigs, false eyelashes, applying makeup, and wearing kawaii female clothing.&lt;ref name="Suzuki"&gt;{{cite web|last=Suzuki |first=Kirin |title=Makeup Changes Men |url=http://tokyokawaiietc.com/archives/9397 |publisher=Tokyo Kawaii, Etc |accessdate=11 April 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130721100514/http://tokyokawaiietc.com/archives/9397 |archivedate=21 July 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; This is seen predominately in male entertainers, such as Torideta-san, a DJ who transforms himself into a kawaii woman when working at his nightclub.&lt;ref name="Suzuki"/&gt;

Japanese pop stars and actors often have longer hair, such as [[Takuya Kimura]] of [[SMAP]]. Men are also noted as often aspiring to a [[Neoteny|neotenic]] look. While it doesn't quite fit the exact specifications of what cuteness means for females, men are certainly influenced by the same societal mores - to be attractive in a specific sort of way that the society finds acceptable.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Bennette|first=Colette|title=It's all Kawaii: Cuteness in Japanese Culture|url=http://geekout.blogs.cnn.com/2011/11/18/its-all-kawaii-cuteness-in-japanese-culture/|publisher=CNN|accessdate=11 April 2013|date=18 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this way both Japanese men and women conform to the expectations of Kawaii in some way or another.

===Products===
The concept of ''kawaii'' has had an influence on a variety of products, including candy, such as [[Hi-Chew]], [[Koala's March]] and [[Hello Panda]]. Cuteness can be added to products by adding cute features, such as hearts, flowers, stars and rainbows. Cute elements can be found almost everywhere in Japan, from big business to corner markets and national government, ward, and town offices.&lt;ref name="Bremmer"&gt;[https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2002-06-24/in-japan-cute-conquers-all ''Bloomberg Businessweek'', "In Japan, Cute Conquers All"].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Cute Inc."&gt;{{cite news | url= https://www.wired.com/wired/archive/7.12/cute.html | title= Cute Inc.| publisher=WIRED|date=December 1999}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many companies, large and small, use cute mascots to present their wares and services to the public. For example:
[[File:Ana.b747.pokemon.arp.750pix.jpg|thumb|[[Pokémon Jet|All Nippon Airways Boeing 747 with a Pokémon livery]]]]
[[File:JNR C11 227 20140824 001.jpg|thumb|[[JNR Class C11]] locomotive repainted as [[Thomas the Tank Engine]], Japan, 2014]]
* [[Pikachu]], a character from ''[[Pokémon]],'' adorns the side of ten [[All Nippon Airways|ANA]] passenger jets, the [[Pokémon Jet]]s.
* [[Resona Holdings|Asahi Bank]] used [[Miffy]] (Nijntje), a character from a [[Netherlands|Dutch]] series of children's picture books, on some of its ATM and credit cards.
* The [[prefectures of Japan]], as well as many cities and cultural institutions, have cute [[mascot]] characters known as [[yuru-chara]] to promote tourism. [[Kumamon]], the [[Kumamoto Prefecture]] mascot, and [[Hikonyan]], the city of [[Hikone]] mascot, are among the most popular.&lt;ref name="Top Ten Japanese Character Mascots"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://findingfukuoka.com/2012/01/13/top-ten-japanese-character-mascots/ |title=Top Ten Japanese Character Mascots |publisher=Finding Fukuoka |date=2012-01-13 |accessdate=2013-12-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The [[Japan Post]] "Yū-Pack" mascot is a stylized mailbox;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.post.japanpost.jp/navi/main.htm Japan Post site showing mailbox mascot] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060221113156/http://www.post.japanpost.jp/navi/main.htm |date=2006-02-21 }} URL accessed April 19, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; they also use other cute mascot characters to promote their various services (among them the Postal Savings Bank) and have used many such on postage stamps.
* Some [[police]] forces in Japan have their own [[moe (slang)|moe]] mascots, which sometimes adorn the front of [[kōban]] (police boxes).
* [[NHK]], the public broadcaster, has its own cute mascots. [[Domo (NHK)|Domokun]], the unique-looking and widely recognized NHK mascot, was introduced in 1998 and quickly took on a life of its own, appearing in [[Internet memes]] and fan art around the world.
* [[Sanrio]], the company behind [[Hello Kitty]] and other similarly cute characters, runs the [[Sanrio Puroland]] [[theme park]] in Tokyo, and painted on some [[EVA Air]] [[Airbus A330]] jets as well. Sanrio’s line of more than 50 characters takes in more than $1 billion a year and it remains the most successful company to capitalize on the cute trend.&lt;ref name="Cute Inc." /&gt;

''Cute'' can be also used to describe a specific [[fashion|fashion sense]]&lt;ref name="Kwest"&gt;''Time Asia'': "Arts: Kwest For Kawaii". Retrieved on 2006-04-19 from http://www.time.com/time/asia/arts/magazine/0,9754,131022,00.html.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''[[The New Yorker]]'' "FACT: SHOPPING REBELLION: What the kids want".

Ruffles and pastel colors are commonly (but not always) featured, and accessories often include toys or bags featuring anime characters.&lt;ref name="Cute Inc." /&gt;

====Non-''kawaii'' imports====
[[File:Kawaii goods.jpg|thumb|left|Kawaii goods outlet in 100 yen shop]]
There have been occasions in which popular Western products failed to meet the expectations of ''kawaii'', and thus did not do well in the Japanese market. For example, [[Cabbage Patch Kids]] dolls did not sell well in Japan, because the Japanese considered their facial features to be "ugly" and "grotesque" compared to the flatter and almost featureless faces of characters such as [[Hello Kitty]].&lt;ref name="Shiokawa" /&gt; Also, the doll [[Barbie]], portraying an adult woman, did not become successful in Japan compared to Takara's [[Licca-chan|Licca]], a doll that was modeled after an 11-year-old girl.&lt;ref name="Shiokawa" /&gt;

Kawaii has gradually gone from a small subculture in Japan to an important part of Japanese modern culture as a whole. There is an overwhelming amount of modern items featuring kawaii themes, not only in Japan, but worldwide.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jref.com/forum/all-things-japanese-26/research-paper-kawaii-culture-cuteness-16924/ (Research Paper) Kawaii: Culture of Cuteness&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130118001552/http://www.jref.com/forum/all-things-japanese-26/research-paper-kawaii-culture-cuteness-16924/ |date=2013-01-18 }}&lt;/ref&gt; And characters associated with kawaii have an astounding popularity these days. We can see the "global cute" by the billion-dollar sellers like [[Pokémon]] and [[Hello Kitty]].&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;Roach, Mary. "Cute Inc."

Japan has become a powerhouse in the kawaii industry and images of [[Doraemon]], [[Hello Kitty]], [[Pikachu]], [[Sailor Moon]] and [[Hamtaro]] are popular in mobile phone accessories. However, Professor Tian Shenliang says that Japan's future is dependent on how much of an impact kawaii brings to humanity.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.epochtw.com/6/10/27/39668.htm 卡哇伊熱潮 扭轉日本文化&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130301054943/http://epochtw.com/6/10/27/39668.htm |date=2013-03-01 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Japanese Foreign Ministry has also recognized the power of cute merchandise and have sent three 18-year-old women overseas in the hopes of spreading Japanese culture around the world. The women are dressed in uniforms and maid costumes that are commonplace in Japan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.chinataiwan.org/wh/sdgl/200904/t20090402_861472.htm|title=日本的"卡哇伊文化"_中国台湾网&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;|publisher=|accessdate=5 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Kawaii manga and magazines have brought tremendous profit to Japanese press industry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://go.huanqiu.com/asia/2011-09/1969974_2.html|title=“萌文化”在日本大行其道_旅游_环球网|first=|last=王力|website=go.huanqiu.com|accessdate=5 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, the worldwide revenue from the computer game and its merchandising peripherals are closing in on $5 billion, according to a [[Nintendo]] press release titled "It's a Pokémon Planet".&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt;

==Influence upon other cultures==
{{tone|section |date=July 2013}}
Kawaii products are seemingly gaining more popularity beyond the borders of Japan into other Asian markets, and it's seemingly becoming more popular in the [[United States|US]], especially among the young anime and manga fans as well as among those who are influenced by Japanese culture. Cute merchandise and products are especially popular in other parts of [[East Asia]], such as [[China]], [[Hong Kong]], [[South Korea]], [[Taiwan]] and [[Southeast Asian]] countries like the [[Philippines]], [[Singapore]], [[Thailand]], and [[Vietnam]].&lt;ref name="Cute Inc." /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newsweek.com/id/90086?tid=relatedcl|title=Cute Power!|date=7 November 1999|publisher=|accessdate=5 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sebastian Masuda, owner of 6%DOKIDOKI and a global advocate for kawaii influence, takes the quality from Harajuku to Western markets in his stores and artwork. The underlying belief of this Japanese designer is that "kawaii" actually saves the world.&lt;ref&gt;(Kataoka, 2010)&lt;/ref&gt; The infusion of kawaii into other world markets and cultures is achieved by introducing kawaii via modern art; audio, visual, and written media; and the fashion trends of Japanese youth, especially in high school girls.&lt;ref name="ebscohost"&gt;Tadao, T.

Japanese kawaii seemingly operates as a center of global popularity due to its association with making cultural productions and consumer products "cute". This mindset pursues a global market,&lt;ref&gt;Brown, J. (2011). Re-framing "Kawaii": Interrogating Global Anxieties Surrounding the Aesthetic of 'Cute' in Japanese Art and Consumer Products. International Journal of the Image, 1(2), 1. Retrieved from: http://search.ebscohost.com/&lt;/ref&gt; giving rise to numerous applications and interpretations in other cultures.

The dissemination of Japanese youth fashion and "kawaii culture" is usually associated with the Western society and trends set by designers borrowed or taken from Japan.&lt;ref name="ebscohost"/&gt; With the emergence of China, South Korea and Singapore as economic centers in Asia, the Kawaii merchandise and product popularity has shifted back to the East. In these Asian markets, the kawaii concept takes on various forms and different types of presentation depending on the target audience.

=== In Asia ===

[[Taiwanese culture]], the government in particular, has embraced and elevated kawaii to a new level of social consciousness. The introduction of the A-Bian doll was seen as the development of a symbol to advance democracy and assist in constructing a collective imagination and national identity for Taiwanese people. The A-Bian dolls are kawaii likeness of sports figure, famous individuals, and now political figures that use kawaii images as a means of self-promotion and potential votes.&lt;ref&gt;[1]A-Bian Family. http://www.akibo.com.tw/home/gallery/mark/03.htm&lt;/ref&gt; The creation of the A-Bian doll has allowed Taiwanese President Chen staffers to create a new culture where the "kawaii" image of a politician can be used to mobilize support and gain election votes.&lt;ref&gt;Chuang, Y.

Japanese popular "kawaii culture" has had an effect on Singaporean youth. The emergence of Japanese culture can be traced back to the mid-1980s when Japan became one of the economic powers in the world. Kawaii has developed from a few children's television shows to an Internet sensation.&lt;ref&gt;[2]All things Kawaii. http://www.allthingskawaii.net/links/&lt;/ref&gt; Japanese media is used so abundantly in Singapore that youths are more likely to imitate the fashion of their Japanese idols, learn the Japanese language, and continue purchasing Japanese oriented merchandise.&lt;ref&gt;Hao, X., Teh, L.L.

Retrieved from: http://www.mediacom.keio.ac.jp/publication/pdf2004/review26/3.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

The Asian countries of China, Hong Kong, South Korea, and Thailand either produce kawaii items for international consumption or have websites that cater for kawaii as part of the youth culture in their country. Kawaii has taken on a life of its own, spawning the formation of kawaii websites, kawaii home pages, kawaii browser themes and finally, kawaii social networking pages. While Japan is the origin and Mecca of all things kawaii, artists and businesses around the world are imitating the kawaii theme.&lt;ref name="ibukimagazine.com"&gt;Rutledge, B. (2010, October). I love kawaii. ''Ibuki'' Magazine. 1–2. Retrieved from: http://ibukimagazine.com/lifestyle-/other-trends/212-i-love-kawaii&lt;/ref&gt;

Kawaii has truly become "greater" than itself. The interconnectedness of today's world via the Internet has taken kawaii to new heights of exposure and acceptance, producing a kawaii "movement".&lt;ref name="ibukimagazine.com"/&gt;

The Kawaii concept has become something of a global phenomenon. The aesthetic cuteness of Japan is very appealing to people globally. The wide popularity of Japanese kawaii is often credited with it being "culturally odorless". The elimination of exoticism and national branding has helped kawaii to reach numerous target audiences and span every culture, class, and gender group.&lt;ref&gt;Shearin, M. (2011, October). Triumph of kawaii. William &amp; Mary ideation. Retrieved from: http://www.wm.edu/research/ideation/ideation-stories-for-borrowing/2011/triumph-of-kawaii5221.php&lt;/ref&gt; The palatable characteristics of kawaii have made it a global hit, resulting in Japan's global image shifting from being known for [[Japanese rock garden|austere rock gardens]] to being known for "cute-worship".&lt;ref name="theage" /&gt;

In 2014 the ''[[Collins English Dictionary]]'' in the [[United Kingdom]] entered "kawaii" into their then latest edition, defining as a "Japanese artistic and cultural style that emphasizes the quality of cuteness, using bright colours and characters with a childlike appearance."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/newsbeat/29761389|publisher=[[BBC]]|title=Kawaii culture in the UK: Japan's trend for cute|date=24 October 2014|accessdate=26 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Economic anthropology}}
A '''moral economy''' is an economy that is based on goodness, fairness, and justice, as opposed to one where the market is assumed to be independent of such concerns. A moral economy is generally only possible in small, closely knit communities, where the principles of [[mutual aid (organization)|mutuality]]—i.e. "I'll scratch your back if you'll scratch mine"—operate to avoid the [[free rider problem]]. Where economic transactions arise between strangers who cannot be sanctioned by a social network, the free rider problem lacks a solution and a moral economy becomes harder to maintain. The concept was an elaboration by English historian [[E.P. Thompson]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Thompson|first=Edward P.|title=Customs in Common|year=1991|publisher=New Press|location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt;, from a term already used by various eighteenth century authors, who felt that economic and moral concerns increasingly seemed to drift apart (see Götz 2015&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Götz | first1 = Norbert | year = 2015 | title = 'Moral economy': its conceptual history and analytical prospects | journal = Journal of Global Ethics | volume = 11 | issue = | pages = 147–162 | doi=10.1080/17449626.2015.1054556}}&lt;/ref&gt;). 

Thompson wrote of the moral economy of the poor in the context of widespread food riots in the English countryside in the late eighteenth century. According to Thompson these riots were generally peaceable acts that demonstrated a common political culture rooted in feudal rights to "set the price" of essential goods in the market. These peasants held that a traditional "fair price" was more important to the community than a "free" market price and they punished large farmers who sold their surpluses at higher prices outside the village while there were still those in need within the village. In the 1970s the concept of a moral economy was developed further in anthropological studies of peasant economies. The notion of a non-capitalist cultural mentality using the market for its own ends has been linked by others (with Thompson's approval) to [[subsistence agriculture]] and the need for subsistence insurance in hard times.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Thompson|first=Edward P.|title=Customs in Common|year=1991|publisher=New Press|location=New York|pages=341}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Cambodiaricefarming1.jpg|thumbnail|Cambodian rice farming]]

==Concept==
The concept was widely popularized in [[anthropology]] through the book ''[[The Moral Economy of the Peasant: Rebellion and Subsistence in Southeast Asia|The Moral Economy of the Peasant: Rebellion and subsistence in Southeast Asia]]'' by [[James C. Scott]] (1976).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Scott|first=James C.|title=The Moral Economy of the Peasant: Rebellion and subsistence in Southeast Asia|year=1976|publisher=Princeton University Press|location=Princeton}}&lt;/ref&gt; The book begins with a telling metaphor of peasants being like a man standing up to his nose in water; the smallest wave will drown him. Similarly, peasants generally live so close to the subsistence line that it takes little to destroy their livelihoods. From this, he infers a set of economic principles that it would be rational for them to live by. It is important to emphasize that this book was not based on fieldwork, and itself proposed a cross-cultural universalistic model of peasant economic behaviour based upon a set of fixed theoretical principles, not a reading of peasant culture. Firstly, he argued that peasants were "risk averse", or, put differently, followed a "safety first" principle. They would not adopt risky new seeds or technologies, no matter how promising, because tried and true traditional methods had demonstrated, not promised, effectiveness. This gives peasants an unfair reputation as "traditionalist" when in fact they are just risk averse. Secondly, Scott argues that peasant society provides "subsistence insurance" for its members to tide them over those occasions when natural or man-made disaster strikes.

==A just economy==
{{main article|Just price}}
A '''moral economy''', in one interpretation, is an economy that is based on goodness, fairness, and justice.  Such an economy is generally only stable in small, closely knit communities, where the principles of [[mutual aid (organization)|mutuality]]—i.e. "I'll scratch your back if you'll scratch mine"—operate to avoid the [[free rider problem]].  Where economic transactions arise between strangers who cannot be informally sanctioned by a social network, the free rider problem lacks a solution and a moral economy becomes harder to maintain.

In traditional societies, each person and each household is a [[consumer]] as well as a [[production, costs, and pricing|producer]].  [[Social network]]s create mutual understandings to promote the survival of these [[social unit]]s in the face of [[scarcity]]; these social ties operate to prevent the economic actors in traditional societies from behaving to maximize personal [[Profit (economics)|profit]].  Traditional understandings arise as to the relative value of various goods and services; they are not independently renegotiated for each transaction in an impersonal, anonymous [[Market (economics)|market]].  Traditional [[staple food]]s and other goods deemed necessary for the survival of the community acquire customary prices; dearth or plenty should be shared by all.  These traditional understandings acquire the force of [[convention (norm)|custom]], and with increased social complexity may eventually acquire the force of [[law]].

''[[The Efficient Society]]'' by [[Joseph Heath]] discusses the nature of a moral economy in these terms, and argues that [[Canada]] has achieved the proper balance between social needs and [[economic freedom]], and as such comes close to being a moral economy.  Other economists such as [[John P. Powelson]] relate the concept of a "moral economy" to the balance of [[economic power]]; in their view, a moral economy is an economy in which economic factors are balanced against ethical norms in the name of [[social justice]].{{citation needed|date=August 2014}}

''Right Relationship'' by Brown and Garver, discusses the urgent need for achieving an economy that is recognized to be a subsidiary of the overall ecosystem of the planet.  They address key questions regarding the purpose, function, appropriate size, fairness, and governance of a world economic system and propose new ideas to place our economy in correct relationship with the Earth's ecosystem.  They argue that such a '''moral economy''' is essential if we are to avoid systemic collapse as our ''growth economy'' outstrips the Earth's limited ability to recycle our waste, and as the Earth's inventory of critical raw materials and minerals is used up, in the face of growing population and growing affluence within those populations.

==Economics and social norms==
In a related sense, "moral economy" is also a name given in [[economics]], [[sociology]] and [[anthropology]] to the interplay between [[culture|cultural]] [[mores]] and economic activity.  It describes the various ways in which custom and social pressure coerce economic actors in a society to conform to [[tradition]]al [[Norm (sociology)|norm]]s even at the expense of [[Profit (economics)|profit]].

Prior to the rise of [[classical economics]] in the eighteenth century, the economies in Europe and its North American colonies were governed by a variety of (formal and informal) regulations designed to prevent "greed" from overcoming "morality". In its most formal manifestations, examples such as the traditional [[Christianity|Christian]] and [[Islam|Muslim]] prohibitions on [[usury]] represent the limits imposed by religious values on economic activity, and as such are part of the moral economy. [[Law]]s that determine what sort of [[contract]]s will be given effect by the [[judiciary]], and what sort of contracts are [[void (law)|void]] or [[voidable]], often incorporate concepts of a moral economy; in many jurisdictions, traditionally a contract involving [[gambling]] was considered [[void (law)|void in law]] because it was against [[public policy]].  These restrictions on [[freedom of contract]] are the results of moral economy.  According to the beliefs which inspired these laws, economic transactions were supposed to be based on mutual obligation, not individual gain.  In colonial Massachusetts, for example, prices and markets were highly regulated, even the fees physicians could charge.&lt;ref&gt;Horwitz, ''Transformations in American Law'', p. 173&lt;/ref&gt;

Other forms of moral economy are more informal.  In the sixteenth and seventeenth century, for instance, clergymen often preached against various economic practices that were not strictly illegal, but were deemed to be "uncharitable".&lt;ref&gt;Collinson, "Puritanism and the Poor"&lt;/ref&gt; Their condemnations of selling food at high prices or raising rents probably influenced the behavior of many people who regarded themselves as Christian and worried about their reputations.

Likewise, during the rapid expansion of capitalism over the past several centuries, the tradition of a pre-capitalist "moral economy" was used to justify popular action against unscrupulous merchants and traders. For example, the poor regularly rioted against grain merchants who raised their prices in years of dearth in an attempt to reassert the concept of the [[just price]].&lt;ref&gt;Thompson, "Moral Economy of the English Crowd"; Randall and Charlesworth, ''Moral Economy and Popular Protest''; Bohstedt, ''The Politics of Provisions''&lt;/ref&gt; The Marxist historian [[E. P. Thompson]] emphasized the continuing force of this tradition in his pioneering article on "The Moral Economy of the English Crowd in the Eighteenth Century" (1971). Later historians and sociologists have uncovered the same phenomenon in a variety of other situations, including peasants' riots in continental Europe during the nineteenth century and in many developing countries in the twentieth. The political scientist [[James C. Scott]], for example, showed how this ideology could be used as a method of resisting authority in ''[[The Moral Economy of the Peasant: Rebellion and Subsistence in Southeast Asia|The Moral Economy of the Peasant: Subsistence and Rebellion in Southeast Asia]]'' (1976).

It must be remembered, however, that sometimes a moral economy may not act in conformity to [[morality]] as it is now generally understood.  Social pressures to enforce [[racial segregation]] even when willing buyers and sellers would erode the racial barriers, are clearly an example of cultural pressures imposing economic inefficiency, and therefore fall within the purview of moral economy.&lt;ref&gt;Van Tessel, "Only the Law"&lt;/ref&gt;

==Utopian moral economies==
In modern times, "utopian moral economies" have arisen to systematically reorganize their economic system to reflect a particular moral or ethical code that rejects the free-market ethos of capitalist economies. Societies that pursue some derivative of [[Socialism]] or [[Communism]] are obvious examples of this impulse, along with small-scale attempts in the form of the Israeli [[kibbutz]] and the [[intentional communities]] of the 1960s and 70s.{{Citation needed|date=November 2016}}

Very few of these experiments—with the possible exception of the kibbutz—turned out the way their founders had imagined. Unsurprisingly, a revolutionary reorganization of some of the most fundamental parts of society often resulted in the severe dislocation of many people's everyday lives and the loss of whole generations to schemes like Stalin's failed policy of [[collective farming]].{{Citation needed|date=November 2016}} However, many of the small and pragmatic attempts to make the capitalist economy more moral (e.g. fair trade, moral investment funds, the development of renewable energy sources, recycling, cooperatives, etc.) have grown from the same impulse that drove the utopian revolutionaries. These developments, however, do not fully realize their intentions, being fundamentally at odds with the mechanisms in the capitalist economy, such as cyclical consumption, the inherent duplicity of goods in competition, and the process of "externalizing" those costs which are not directly pertinent to an actor's finances.

==Background==
=== Differences to epigenetic ===
Morphogenetic robotics is related to, but differs from, [[epigenetic robotics]]. The main difference between morphogenetic robotics and epigenetic robotics is that the former focuses on [[self-organization]], self-reconfiguration, self-assembly and self-adaptive control of robots using genetic and cellular mechanisms inspired from biological early morphogenesis (''activity-independent development''), during which the body and controller of the organisms are developed simultaneously, whereas the latter emphasizes the development of robots' cognitive capabilities, such as language, emotion and social skills, through experience during the lifetime (''activity-dependent development''). Morphogenetic robotics is closely connected to [[developmental biology]] and [[systems biology]], whilst epigenetic robotics is related to [[developmental cognitive neuroscience]] emerged from [[cognitive science]], [[developmental psychology]] and [[neuroscience]].

=== Topics ===
Morphogenetic robotics includes, but is not limited to the following main topics:

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12556">'''Postnaturalism''' is the theory of the '''postnatural''', a term coined to describe organisms that have been intentionally and heritably altered by humans. Postnaturalism is a cultural process whereby organisms are bred to satisfy a specific cultural purpose. It can be used to read these organisms, which serve as insights into our culture by reflecting desires and beliefs prevalent at the time of breeding. This has direct implications for the [[evolution]]ary path of these organisms,&lt;ref name="CPNH"&gt;{{cite web | title =About | work = | publisher =Center for PostNatural History | date = | url =http://www.postnatural.org/About | accessdate = April 23, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; whittling down undesirable traits to leave only those culturally sought out. Postnaturalism argues that in so doing, humans have and continue to actively alter the evolutionary path of a postnatural organism to suit our cultural desires. The agricultural practice of [[monoculture]], for instance, is just one example of postnatural organisms who have been bred to such an extent that the modern-day species look nothing like their pre-[[Neolithic Revolution|neolithic]] counterparts. The breeding of these species for this purpose can be seen to be reflected in notable diet changes during this period,&lt;ref name ="Nutrition"&gt;{{cite journal | last=Richards | first=MP | date=2002 | title=A brief review of the archaeological evidence for Palaeolithic and Neolithic subsistence | url=http://www.nature.com/ejcn/journal/v56/n12/pdf/1601646a.pdf | journal=European Journal of Clinical Nutrition | volume = 56 | doi = 10.1038/sj.ejcn.1601646 | access-date = May 5, 2015 | pmid=12494313 | pages=16 p following 1262}}&lt;/ref&gt; which proliferated during ensuing sedentism and urbanisation.&lt;ref name ="Nutrition"/&gt;

Postnaturalism is a highly selective process. For every organism that has become used in our society, there are countless more that have remained non-postnatural for whatever reason ranging from a perceived lack of future use from them or traits that make them too difficult to farm. One such example is the golden orb-weaver spider which produces a strong, light and useful silk, however they are known to be cannibalistic and thus impossible to farm on a large scale.&lt;ref name="SpiderSilk"&gt;{{cite web | author = Ferguson, Cat | title = Mixing Spider DNA and Goat Embryos Produces Milk With a Side of Silk  | work = | publisher = takepart | date = April 10, 2014 | url = http://www.takepart.com/article/2014/04/10/gmo-goats | accessdate = May 7, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Postnatural History==
Postnatural history is defined as the "study of the origins, habitats, and evolution of organisms that have been ''intentionally'' and ''heritably'' altered by humans", which serves as a "record of the influence of human culture on evolution".&lt;ref name="CPNH" /&gt; So termed to differentiate it from traditional [[natural history]] studies, it is the subject of a storefront in [[Pittsburgh]], United States called the [[Center for PostNatural History]], which builds on this concept to produce an array of displays of organisms which are all postnatural.&lt;ref name="CPNH" /&gt;

==Domestication==
The commencement of the postnatural can be considered to date back to [[Prehistory|prehistoric]] civilisation's early interaction with wild species. Here, [[domestication]] occurred as a way of adapting the environment around prehistoric people to suit their needs and desires through a gradual process of refinement. Domestication succeeds through the heritable continuation of an organism's [[phenotype]] and [[genotype]] allowing each generation to continue on from their previous generation. In its simplest terms, domestication alters a species through survival to a change in habitat, food source, or other significant change. These changes can be sought for a variety of different reasons including physical attributes, behavioural characteristics, lifespan, and adaptability to a change in environment.&lt;ref name="diamond"&gt;{{cite book |last=Diamond|first= Jared|authorlink=Jared Diamond| year=1999|title=[[Guns, Germs, and Steel]]|publisher= New York: Norton Press|isbn= 0-393-31755-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Selective breeding==
Postnatural practices include [[selective breeding]], a process by which humans purposefully breed certain organisms for particular biological traits. The practice was known to the [[Ancient Rome|Romans]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Buffum, Burt C. |title=Arid Agriculture; A Hand-Book for the Western Farmer and Stockman|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Rmbur_Am8vgC&amp;pg=PA232|date=2008|publisher=Read Books|isbn=978-1-4086-6710-1|page=232}}&lt;/ref&gt; and has been commonly used continuing to this day. [[Michael Pollan]] argues that [[Charles Darwin]] saw this process and considered it artificial, rather than natural, selection, but in terms of evolutionary progress this distinction becomes irrelevant to the species; the change is irreversible all the same.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Pollan, Michael |title=The Botany of Desire: A Plants-Eye View of the World|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=W_L_2yTfOEEC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=the+botany+of+desire&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=hlg5VdavMYmKNsbUgNAH&amp;ved=0CCcQ6AEwAA|date=2001|publisher=Random House Trade Paperbacks|isbn=0-375-76039-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is simply because evolution is understood to be unable to 'undo' previous changes, but, particularly in proteins,&lt;ref name="EvolutionProgression"&gt;{{cite web | author=Coghlan, Andy | title =For proteins, evolution can't go backwards  | work = | publisher =New Scientist | date = September 23, 2009| url =https://www.newscientist.com/article/dn17841-for-proteins-evolution-cant-go-backwards.html#.VUvzE_lVikp | accessdate = May 7, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; continues along in a progression of its biological structure depending on what traits are required for survival.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Rush, J.H. |title=The Dawn of Life|url=https://www.amazon.com/The-Dawn-Life-J-Rush/dp/0451021924|date=1962|publisher=Signet, First Printing Edition|isbn=0-451-02192-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author=Huxley, Julian | editor-last=Newman | editor-first=James Roy | title=What is Science? Twelve Eminent Scientists and Philosophers Explain Their Various Fields to the Layman | publisher = Simon and Schuster | date = 1955 | pages = 277–278 | chapter = Chapter 8: Evolution and Genetics | id= ASIN B-000-0CJL3-S}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Induced Mutation==
Induced mutation in the context of postnaturalism is the process whereby a specific genetic mutation - usually a rare occurrence - is selectively isolated by people and encouraged to reproduce in future offspring. This differs from the general understanding of a mutation that was induced by treatment from a particular chemical agent in a living species.&lt;ref name="InducedMutation"&gt;{{cite web | title =induced mutation  | work = | publisher =The Free Dictionary by Farlex | date = | url =http://medical-dictionary.thefreedictionary.com/induced+mutation | accessdate = May 7, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A good example of this is the albino rat which possesses, in the wild a notoriously fatal genetic make-up&lt;ref name="AlbinoRat"&gt;{{cite web | author = Royer, Nichole | title =The Pink-Eyed White Rat  | work = | publisher =American Fancy Rat and Mouse Association | date = October 12, 2014 | url =http://www.afrma.org/pewrats.htm | accessdate = May 7, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; making it much easier to identify to predators, a coat which drew interest in breeders so as to distinguish them from their more unhygienic-looking sewer counterparts prevalent in major cities in the 1800s. So numerous were rats in industrial cities, they became the subject of a sport based on their extermination, [[rat-baiting]].&lt;ref name="Rat-baiting"&gt;{{cite web | title =Rats II: Man vs Vermin  | work = | publisher =History House Inc | date = | url =http://www.historyhouse.com/in_history/rats_2/ | accessdate = May 7, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The albino rat thus became distinguished from the regular unsightly sewer rat and even became sold as pets, the owning of one as a child allegedly the basis for Beatrix Potter's book ''Samuel Whiskers''.&lt;ref name="AlbinoRat"/&gt;

==Genetic Engineering==
[[Genetic Engineering]] can be considered to be the purposeful alteration of the genetic makeup of an organism through the introduction of genes from sources not belonging to that organism. The isolation of a particular gene and introduction of another is often achieved through the use of [[biotechnology]] more broadly.&lt;ref name = "GEng"&gt;{{cite web | author = MacDonald Glenn, Linda | title = Ethical Issues in Genetic Engineering and Transgenics | work = | publisher = American Institute of Biological Sciences | date = November 2013 | url = http://www.actionbioscience.org/biotechnology/glenn.html | accessdate = May 18, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
Genetic engineering is a contentious topic and even in searching for a definition, there are several alternatives available highlighting the variation in perceptions around what is considered to be the goal and process of genetic engineering.&lt;ref name ="GEng1"&gt;{{cite web | title = What is genetic engineering and how does it work? | work = | publisher = University of Nebraska, Lincoln | date = | url = http://agbiosafety.unl.edu/basic_genetics.shtml | accessdate = May 18, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = "GEng2"&gt;{{cite web | title = What Is Genetic Engineering? | work = | publisher = Union of Concerned Scientists | date = | url = http://www.ucsusa.org/food_and_agriculture/our-failing-food-system/genetic-engineering/what-is-genetic-engineering.html#.VVpOqhFFDIU | accessdate = May 18, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = "GEng3"&gt;{{cite web | title = genetic engineering | work = | publisher = Tech Target | date = | url = http://whatis.techtarget.com/definition/genetic-engineering | accessdate = May 18, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = "GEng4"&gt;{{cite web | author = Melina, Remy | title = What's Genetic Engineering | work = | publisher = Live Science | date = June 15, 2010 | url = http://whatis.techtarget.com/definition/genetic-engineering | accessdate = May 18, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, genetic engineering embodies much of what is considered postnatural, but doing so with the next level of technology than used in previous methods such as those mentioned in the above sections. Increased use of advanced technology allows for improved precision and accuracy of methods, and carrying out of transgenics, whilst the use of laboratories as settings is designed to prevent the release of experimented organisms into the wild unless cleared with the relevant protocols and regulations beforehand.

==Concerns over postnaturalism's proliferation in monoculture==
The current agricultural practice of monoculture is intricately connected with postnaturalism, particularly now much of common contemporary agricultural practice has become mechanised. This mechanisation sometimes requires universality to comply with existing tools, machines and practices, such as the breeding of chickens to be a uniform size to ensure they fit into [[Chicken harvester|chicken harvesting]] machines.&lt;ref name = "Chicken-catchingMachines"&gt;{{cite web | author = Free From Harm Staff Writers | title = 17 Chicken Facts the Industry Doesn’t Want You to Know | work = | publisher = Free From Harm | date = August 28, 2014 | url = http://freefromharm.org/animalagriculture/chicken-facts-industry-doesnt-want-know/ | accessdate = June 16, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; On other occasions rather than breed a particular species to a uniform size, some parts of organisms have been so heavily bred and altered that [[dystocia]] can regularly occur, such as with the [[Belgian Blue]] cattle whose birth canal regularly becomes constricted or even entirely blocked due to the birth canal's reduced size and the increased size of calves.&lt;ref name = "Cheville256" /&gt; The result is the routine scheduling of [[Caesarian section]]s.&lt;ref name="Cheville256"&gt;{{cite book|author=Cheville, Norman F. |title=Introduction to veterinary pathology| date=1999| publisher=Wiley-Blackwell| isbn=978-0-8138-2496-3| url=https://books.google.com/books?id=U-OF4rmihIUC}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Educational Vet Video|title=Video of Cow Caesarean Section|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2HJNAgoels|work=VetPulse TV in Practice|publisher=YouTube|accessdate=June 16, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''punch''' is a [[strike (attack)|striking]] blow with the fist.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/punch |title=Punch &amp;#124; Define Punch at Dictionary.com |publisher=Dictionary.reference.com |date= |accessdate=2011-11-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is used in most [[martial art]]s and [[combat sport]]s, most notably [[Boxing]], where it is the only type of offensive technique allowed. In sports, [[hand wrap]]s or other padding such as gloves may be used to protect athletes and practitioners from injuring themselves.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | publisher = Ringside.com | url = http://www.ringside.com/WrapYourHands.aspx | title = The Proper Way to Wrap Your Hands | accessdate = 2007-07-29 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070426032249/http://www.ringside.com/WrapYourHands.aspx &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = 2007-04-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ballard, Willie L. "[http://www.freepatentsonline.com/5295269.html Portable Hand Wrap]" Mar 22. 1994. Retrieved on June 29, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

The use of punches varies between different martial arts and combat sports. Styles such as Boxing, [[Suntukan]] or [[Russian fist fighting]] use punches alone, while others such as [[Kickboxing]], [[Muay Thai]], [[Lethwei]] or [[Karate]] may use both punches and [[kick]]s. Others such as [[wrestling]] and [[judo]] (punches and other striking techniques, [[atemi]], are present in judo kata, but are forbidden in competitions) do not use punches at all. There are many types of punches and as a result, different styles encompass varying types of punching techniques.

|Backfist
|A backfist is performed by forming a fist and striking with the backside of the fist.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Oyama|first=Masutatsu|title=Mas Oyama's Classic Karate|year=2004|publisher=Sterling; Chrysalis (distributor)|location=New York: London|isbn=1-4027-1287-1|others=Translated by Tomoko Murakami|pages=16–17}}&lt;/ref&gt; A ''spinning backfist'' is performed when the attacker swivels 360 degrees before landing the punch, adding extra momentum to the attack. The fighter will lunge and begin spinning toward the side of the opponent of which fist he or she will attack with. Simpler terms, go to the left, spin to the left and connect with the left fist and vice versa.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ifafitness.com/kickbox/upper/backfist.htm |title=IFA Kickboxing Library |at=Spinning Backfist |website=International Fitness Association |date= |accessdate=2011-11-09 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160629174843/http://www.ifafitness.com/kickbox/upper/backfist.htm |archive-date=2016-06-29 |dead-url=yes |first=Tony |last=Carr}}&lt;/ref&gt;

|Chambered Punch
|A strike commonly performed in karate, kung fu, and tae kwon do, originating from a "chambered" position.
|-
|[[Cross (boxing)|Cross]] or straight
|A direct straight punch similar to the jab, except delivered with the rear hand. Power is generated through the rotation of the hips.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Scully|first=John|title=Learn To Box|url=http://www.saddoboxing.com/learn.html|publisher=Saddo Boxing|accessdate=25 June 2012|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/68h3dmJIF|archivedate=25 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Difference between a cross and a straight punch|url=http://heavyfists.com/right-cross-straight-right-difference|accessdate=14 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;
|-
|[[Jab]]
|The jab is a straight blow delivered (generally from a distance) with the arm above the lead foot ... The punch is quick and explosive. This punch must land from the very tips of the knuckles and not from a flat fist. " It is generally used for distraction, keeping distance, setting up, and defense.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Jab Punch|url=http://www.britannica.com/eb/art-71117|work=Encyclopædia Britannica|accessdate=29 June 2007|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071013145009/http://www.britannica.com/eb/art-71117/Jab-The-jab-is-a-straight-blow-delivered-with-the|archivedate=13 October 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Jab punch|url=http://www.all-karate.com/140/jab-punch-kizami-zuki|publisher=All-Karate.com|accessdate=25 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;
|-
|[[Leopard Blow|Long Fist]]
|By tucking the fingertips against the bottom knuckle of each finger, a long fist is formed. They offer decreased strength but increased reach. The striking surface is also narrower, which allows the fist to dig between ribs and other soft target areas.
|-
|[[Hammer Fist]]
|A compacted fist is brought down upon the target, usually using the outside area of the fist.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Oyama|first=Masutatsu|title=Mas Oyama's Classic Karate|year=2004|publisher=Sterling; Chrysalis (distributor)|location=New York: London|isbn=1-4027-1287-1|others=Translated by Tomoko Murakami|page=26}}&lt;/ref&gt;
|-
|Haymaker
|A punch in which the arm is whipped sideways from the shoulder joint with minimal elbow bend. The name is derived from the motion, which mimics the action of manually cutting hay by swinging a [[scythe]]. The haymaker is considered an imperfect/impure punch, as the angle of approach is unsupported by the remainder of the forearm. Since a haymaker's power is derived completely from weight transfer and momentum instead of muscle contraction, a long windup is required to generate sufficient force. Haymakers, in the form of shoulder punches, are frequently used from a [[Mount (grappling)|mounted position]] in [[mixed martial arts]] as part of the "[[ground and pound]]" method, as the legs cannot be used to generate power. When thrown from standing, these punches leave the person vulnerable to a counter punch during the wind up, if blocked, or if the haymaker misses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Mongold|first=Brian|title=How to Throw a Punch|url=http://www.eazycheezy.net/2010/04/how-to-throw-a-punch-by-guest-author-the-wolf.html|publisher=Eazycheezy.net|accessdate=25 June 2012|author2=The Wolf}}&lt;/ref&gt;
|-
|[[Hook (boxing)|Hook]]
|A punch involving the use of turning to aim toward the side of the head or body. This punch must land from the very tips of the knuckles and not from a flat fist.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Hook Punch Technique|url=http://www.physical-arts.com/training/techniques/mn_hook_punch.html|publisher=Physical-Arts.com|accessdate=25 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;
|-
|[[Drop (boxing)|Overhand]]
|A semi-circular and vertical punch thrown with the rear hand. It is usually when the opponent is [[Bobbing (boxing)|bobbing]] or [[slipping]]. The strategic utility of the drop relying on body weight can deliver a great deal of power. This punch must land from the very tips of the knuckles and not from a flat fist.
|-
|Shovel Hook
|A close range punch that is halfway between a hook and an uppercut. Shovel hooks are most commonly used to strike the body at a 45 degree angle. For example, a liver shot can be done using a shovel hook. This punch must land from the very tips of the knuckles and not from a flat fist.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Shovel Hook|url=http://www.boxing4free.com/punches/38-shovel-hook.html|publisher=Boxing4Free.com|accessdate=25 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;
|-
|[[Uppercut]]
|The fist is raised vertically towards the target, usually the head or upper body. Since most guards are held with the arms in a vertical position, the uppercut can be used to avoid the opponent's attempts at blocking. This punch must land from the very tips of the knuckles and not from a flat fist.
|-
|Upset Punch
|Starts with the fist in the chambered position, with the palm facing downwards, delivered to the abdomen or solar plexus.
|-
|Casting Punch
|This is a punch used in [[Sambo (martial art)|Sambo]] and [[Mixed martial arts|MMA]] that starts with a forward motion of the shoulders, which causes the bent arm to whip forward to the opponent. This punch can often cause the opponent to be put in a clinch if it misses at close range.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Kaplowitz|first=Matthew|title=How to Throw the Fedor Punch|url=http://www.thefightnerd.com/casting-punch-aka-fedor-punch/|publisher=TheFightNerd.com|accessdate=25 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
|- 
|[[Superman punch|Superman Punch]]
|A '''superman punch''' or '''diving punch''' is a technique used in [[Muay Thai]], ITF-style [[Taekwon-Do]], full contact [[karate]] and [[mixed martial arts]] fighting. The striker will lunge toward the opponent pushing off with the back foot punching with the opposite arm of the leg used to push off with although there may be variations in the name and technique, depending on the fighting style. The pose should resemble that of Superman flying through the air, hence the name.
|-
|[[Sucker punch]]
| A punch that takes the enemy by surprise, possibly knocking them out or otherwise incapacitating them. Could be an unexpected blow to the stomach or a strike from behind that the victim did not see coming.

{{main|Boxing punches}}
In boxing, punches are classified according to the motion and direction of the strike; contact is always made with the knuckles. There are four primary punches in boxing: the [[jab]], [[Cross (boxing)|cross]], [[Hook (boxing)|hook]], and [[uppercut]].  
[[Image:JJS Karate Kids on Training.jpg|left|200px|thumb|A karateka performing a 'reverse punch' or [[gyaku zuki]] being performed by two young boys.]]

=== Karate ===
[[File:Seiken.png|thumb|Seiken]]
Punching techniques in [[Karate]] are called ''[[tsuki]]'' or ''zuki''. Contact is made with the first two knuckles (''seiken'').&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Oyama|first=Masutatsu|title=Mas Oyama's Classic Karate|year=2004|publisher=Sterling; Chrysalis (distributor)|location=New York: London|isbn=1-4027-1287-1|others=Translated by Tomoko Murakami|page=13}}&lt;/ref&gt; If any other part of the hand is used to strike with, such as the back of the fist (''uraken'') or the bottom of the fist (''tetsui''), then the blow is classified as a [[strike (attack)|strike]] (uchi).

Karate punches include the thrust punch ''[[Oi zuki|oi-zuki]]'' made using the lead-hand, straight punch ''[[choku-zuki]]'', reverse punch ''[[gyaku-zuki]]'', made from the opposite (lead) hand, and many other variations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Funakoshi|first=Gichin|title=Karate-dō Nyūmon: The Master Introductory Text|year=1994|publisher=Kodansha International|location=Tokyo|isbn=4-7700-1891-6|others=Translated by John Teramoto|pages=51–52, 64–65}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11629">The '''Pygmalion effect''', or '''Rosenthal effect''', is the phenomenon whereby others' expectations of a target person affect the target person's performance.&lt;ref name = Mitchell&gt;{{cite book |last1=Mitchell |first1=Terence R. |last2=Daniels |first2=Denise |editor-last=Walter C. Borman |editor2=Daniel R. Ilgen |editor3=Richard J. Klimoski |title=Handbook of Psychology (volume 12)|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc. |date=2003 |pages=229 |chapter=Motivation |isbn=0-471-38408-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; The effect is named after the Greek myth of [[Pygmalion (mythology)|Pygmalion]], a sculptor who fell in love with a statue he had carved, or alternately, after the Rosenthal–Jacobson study (see below).

A corollary of the Pygmalion effect is the [[golem effect]], in which low expectations lead to a decrease in performance;&lt;ref name = Mitchell /&gt; both effects are forms of [[self-fulfilling prophecy]]. By the Pygmalion effect, people internalize their positive labels, and those with positive labels succeed accordingly. The idea behind the Pygmalion effect is that increasing the leader's expectation of the follower's performance will result in better follower performance. Within [[sociology]], the effect is often cited with regard to [[education]] and [[social class]]. The concept of [[stereotype threat]] could be considered to be the inverse of the Pygmalion effect, as it denotes a negative form of self-fulfilling prophecy.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;https://www.ode.state.or.us/initiatives/closinggap/2005/threatstereo-edldrshp112004.pdf&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

== Rosenthal–Jacobson study ==
[[Robert Rosenthal (psychologist)|Robert Rosenthal]] and [[Lenore Jacobson]]'s [[Pygmalion in the Classroom|study]] showed that, if [[teacher]]s were led to expect enhanced performance from children, then the children's performance was enhanced. This study supported the hypothesis that reality can be positively or negatively influenced by the expectations of others, called the [[observer-expectancy effect]]. Rosenthal argued that biased expectancies could affect reality and create self-fulfilling prophecies.&lt;ref name="RosenthalJacobson1992"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Rosenthal, Robert|author2=Jacobson, Lenore|authorlink1=Robert Rosenthal (psychologist)|authorlink2=Lenore Jacobson|title=Pygmalion in the classroom : teacher expectation and pupils' intellectual development.|date=1992|publisher=Crown House Pub.|location=Bancyfelin, Carmarthen, Wales|isbn=978-1904424062|edition=Newly expanded}}&lt;/ref&gt;

All students in a single California elementary school were given a disguised IQ test at the beginning of the study. These scores were not disclosed to teachers. Teachers were told that some of their students (about 20% of the school chosen at random) could be expected to be "intellectual bloomers" that year, doing better than expected in comparison to their classmates. The bloomers' names were made known to the teachers. At the end of the study, all students were again tested with the same IQ-test used at the beginning of the study.  All six grades in both experimental and control groups showed a mean gain in IQ from before the test to after the test.  However, First and Second Graders showed statistically significant gains favoring the experimental group of "intellectual bloomers". This led to the conclusion that teacher expectations, particularly for the youngest children, can influence student achievement. Rosenthal believed that even attitude or mood could positively affect the students when the teacher was made aware of the "bloomers". The teacher may pay closer attention to and even treat the child differently in times of difficulty.

Rosenthal predicted that [[elementary school]] teachers may subconsciously behave in ways that facilitate and encourage the students' success. When finished, Rosenthal theorized that future studies could be implemented to find teachers who would encourage their students naturally without changing their teaching methods. The prior research that motivated this study was done in 1911 by psychologists regarding the case of [[Clever Hans]], a horse that gained notoriety because it was supposed to be able to read, spell, and solve math problems by using its hoof to answer. Many skeptics suggested that questioners and observers were unintentionally signaling Clever Hans. For instance, whenever Clever Hans was asked a question the observers' demeanor usually elicited a certain behavior from the subject that in turn confirmed their expectations. For example, Clever Hans would be given a math problem to solve, and the audience would get very tense the closer he tapped his foot to the right number, thus giving Hans the clue he needed to tap the correct number of times.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gutenberg.org/files/33936/33936-h/33936-h.htm#CHAPTER_IV |title=The Project Gutenberg eBook of Clever Hans (The Horse of Mr. von Osten), by Oskar Pfungst |publisher=Gutenberg.org |date= |accessdate=2015-10-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Students' views of teachers ==
Teachers are also affected by the children in the classroom. Teachers reflect what is projected into them by their students. An experiment done by Jenkins and Deno (1969) submitted teachers to a classroom of children who had either been told to be attentive, or unattentive, to the teachers' lecture. They found that teachers who were in the attentive condition would rate their teaching skills as higher.&lt;ref&gt;Jenkins, J. R., &amp; Deno, S. L.  (1969).  ''Influence of student behavior on teacher's self-evaluation.''  [[Journal of Educational Psychology]], 60, 439-442&lt;/ref&gt; Similar findings by Herrell (1971) stated that when a teacher was preconditioned to classrooms as warm or cold, the teacher would start to gravitate towards their precondition.&lt;ref&gt;[http://eric.ed.gov/?id=ED056331 Galatea in the Classroom: Student Expectations Affect Teacher Behavior]; Herrell, James M.&lt;/ref&gt; To further this concept, Klein (1971) did the same kind of study involving teachers still unaware of any precondition to the classroom but with the class full of confederates who were instructed to act differently during periods over the course of the lecture. "Klein reported that there was little difference between students' behaviors in the natural and the positive conditions."&lt;ref name="Good 1974 276–277"&gt;{{cite book|last=Good|first=Jere E. Brophy, Thomas L.|title=Teacher-student relationships: causes and consequences|year=1974|publisher=Holt, Rinehart and Winston|location=London|isbn=0-03-085749-X|pages=276–277}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a more observational study designed to remove the likes of the [[Hawthorne effect]], Oppenlander (1969) studied the top and bottom 20% of students in the sixth grade from a school that tracks and organizes its students under such criteria.&lt;ref name="Good 1974 276–277" /&gt;

==Criticism of the Pygmalion study==
Soon after ''Pygmalion'''s publication, [[Robert L. Thorndike]], an [[educational psychology|educational psychologist]], criticized the study and demonstrated that the instrument used to assess the children's IQ scores was seriously flawed.&lt;ref name="Thorndike"&gt;Thorndike, R.L. (1968). Reviewed work: Pygmalion in the classroom by Robert Rosenthal and Lenore Jacobson. ''American Educational Research Journal, 5''(4), 708-711.&lt;/ref&gt; For example, the average reasoning IQ score for the children in one regular class was in the retarded range, which, given the circumstances, is impossible. In the end, Thorndike wrote the Pygmalion study's findings were worthless. He summarized his evaluation of the instrument this way: "When the clock strikes thirteen, doubt is not only cast on the last stroke but also on all that have come before....When the clock strikes 14, we throw away the clock."&lt;ref name="Thorndike"/&gt; Rosenthal countered that "even if the initial test results were faulty, that didn’t invalidate the subsequent increase, as measured by the same test,"&lt;ref&gt;http://discovermagazine.com/2015/dec/14-great-expectations&lt;/ref&gt; although with initial IQ scores in the retarded range the observed change at the conclusion of the study is more likely to reflect [[regression toward the mean|regression-to-the-mean]] effects than the effect of teacher expectations.

A major limitation has also been the lack of replication. "Most studies using product measures found no expectancy advantage for the experimental group, but most studies using process measures did show teachers to be treating the experimental group more favorably or appropriately than they were treating the control group...because teachers did not adopt the expectations that the experimenters were attempting to induce, and/or because the teachers were aware of the nature of the experiment."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Good|first=Jere E. Brophy, Thomas L.|title=Teacher-student relationships: causes and consequences|year=1974|publisher=Holt, Rinehart and Winston|location=London|isbn=0-03-085749-X|page=73}}&lt;/ref&gt; A meta-analysis indicates that the magnitude of the effect of inducing IQ-related expectancies in teachers is reduced by the amount of time teachers have spent getting to know their students prior to expectancy induction: &lt;ref&gt;Raudenbush, S. W. (1984). Magnitude of teacher expectancy effects on pupil IQ as a function of the credibility of expectancy induction: A synthesis of findings from 18 experiments. ''Journal of Educational Psychology, 76''(1), 85-97. doi:10.1037/0022-0663.76.1.85&lt;/ref&gt; When teachers have gotten to know their students for more than two weeks prior to expectancy induction, the impact of expectancy induction is virtually zero.

== In the workplace ==
Leader expectations of the employee may alter leader behavior. This behavior that is expressed toward an employee can affect the behaviors of the employee in favor of the leader's expectations.&lt;ref name = Bezuijen&gt;Bezuijen, X., van den Berg, P., van Dam, K., &amp; Thierry, H. (2009). "Pygmalion and employee learning: The role of leader behaviors". ''[[Journal of Management]]'', 35(5), 1248–1267. doi: 10.1177/0149206308329966&lt;/ref&gt; The more an employee is engaged in learning activities, the higher the expectation is from the leader. In turn, the employee participates in more learning behavior. Leaders will show more leader behaviors such as leader-member exchange (trust, respect, obligation, etc.), setting specific goals, and allowing for more learning opportunities for employees, and giving employees feedback. These factors were brought about by Rosenthal's model of the Pygmalion effect.&lt;ref name = Bezuijen /&gt;

'''Recursive recycling''' is a technique where a function, in order to accomplish a task, calls itself with some part of the task or output from a previous step. In [[municipal solid waste]] and waste reclamation processing it is the process of extracting and converting materials from recycled materials derived from the previous step until all subsequent levels of output are extracted or used.

==Example==

===Level 1 recursive===
Solid waste or [[municipal solid waste]] can be treated, sanitized and separated under steam in a pressure vessel ([[waste autoclave]]). Following the processing under steam and removal of toxic materials via [[Condensation reaction|condensate]] filtering, usable recyclables are immediately extracted for reuse (plastics, [[ferrous]] metals, [[aluminum]], glass, wood, etc.).

===Level 2 recursive===
[[Organic material]]s from the original waste stream are converted to a fiber using steam at 60 psi and 160&amp;nbsp;°C. The converted organics (sanitary fiber) is size reduced by 85% and can be used to produce bio-fuels using acidic-[[hydrolysis]] or enzymatic-[[hydrolysis]] as [[ethanol]] or may be used as [[refuse derived fuel]].

===Level 3 recursive===
After the monosacrides are extracted for [[distillation]], the remaining residue (used fiber) can be used as a feed stock for [[electricity]] production.

===Level 4 recursive===
Finally, the non-toxic ash from the [[Combustion|combust]]ed fiber can be collected and used as a filler for preparation in super concrete and then
reused in combination with similar materials (gravel, stones, pottery, glass) to form aggregate for construction materials.

In true recursive recycling and conservation processing the ability to divert all materials in the waste stream from landfill at greater than 99 percent is a concept based on outputs used to provide the next level of processing, reuse, conservation and market delivery of the derivatives.

===Analyst commentary===
The concept of recursive recycling has been proved up in small scale facilities ([[thermal hydrolysis]], plasma, etc.) but has not been widely accepted because of the financial impact it may have on existing protocols in waste management. One pilot facility operated commercially in Wales for approximately six years. However, the core equipment was moved to another location while the original facility was scheduled for retrofit. No further information about the facility's capacity or the equipment movement has been made available via open source release.

Since that pilot commercial facility stopped operating, the concept of recursive recycling has not met with as much success as  originally anticipated by environmentalists and conservationists. There are a number of companies operating autoclaves with limited success across the globe (the autoclave operating in Anaheim California was de-commissioned in c. late 2007-early 2008) but the full concept of waste treatment using thermal hydrolysis technology has not been fully realized because of several misconceptions in the autoclave and related steam treatment technologies. There is available engineering background to demonstrate successful testing that can be validated in physical production facilities but because of a lack of participation and general knowledge is a closely held secret, the application of technologies to achieve full recursive levels has not been accepted.

A number of companies are working on technology to support this concept. That may bring about change to conservation and recycling  when associated advances prove out as successful. However, given the current state related areas of technology the growth to full-scale production appears to be limited because the technology and demonstrating it is available in larger capacities has not been demonstrated commercially.

'''Reform''' ({{lang-lat|reformo}}) means the improvement or amendment of what is wrong, corrupt, unsatisfactory, etc.&lt;ref&gt;dictionary definition http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/reform?s=t&lt;/ref&gt; The use of the word in this way emerges in the late 18th century and is believed to originate from [[Christopher Wyvill#The Yorkshire Association|Christopher Wyvill’s Association movement]] which identified “Parliamentary Reform” as its primary aim.&lt;ref&gt;Reform in English Public Life: the fortunes of a word. Joanna Innes 2003&lt;/ref&gt;

Reform is generally distinguished from [[revolution]]. The latter means basic or radical change; whereas reform may be no more than fine tuning, or at most redressing serious wrongs without altering the fundamentals of the system.  Reform seeks to improve the system as it stands, never to overthrow it wholesale. Radicals on the other hand, seek to improve the system, but try to overthrow whether it be the government or a group of people themselves.

[[Rotation in office]] or [[term limits]] would, by contrast, be more revolutionary, in altering basic political connections between incumbents and constituents.&lt;ref&gt;On term limits reform see, [http://www.ustl.org/index.html U.S. Term Limits].  On more radical/revolutionary changes, including term limits, see, for example, Robert Struble, Jr., [http://www.tell-usa.org  ''Treatise on Twelve Lights: To Restore America the Beautiful under God and the Written Constitution''], 2007-08 edition.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Developing countries]] may carry out a wide range of reforms to improve their living standards, often with support from [[international financial institutions]] and [[aid agencies]]. This can include reforms to [[macroeconomic policy]], the [[civil service reform in developing countries|civil service]], and [[Public finance|public financial management]].

[[Reform (Religion)|Religious Reforms]] are performed in religions and churches.

==Re-form==
A note about [[spelling]]: when used to describe something which is ''physically'' formed again, such as re-[[casting]] it in a [[molding (process)|mold/mould]], or a [[band (music)|band]] that gets back together, the proper term is ''re-form'' (with a [[hyphen]]), not "reform".

[[File:Huck Finn Travelling by Rail.jpg|thumb|300px|One of the two con men being paraded on a rail in ''[[Adventures of Huckleberry Finn]]'']]
'''Riding the rail''' (also called being "run out of town on a rail") was a punishment most prevalent in the United States in the 18th and 19th centuries in which an offender was made to straddle a fence rail held on the shoulders of two or more bearers.  The subject was then paraded around town or taken to the city limits and dumped by the roadside.  

Being ridden on a rail was typically a form of [[extrajudicial punishment]] administered by a mob, sometimes in connection with [[tarring and feathering]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Farmer's Dictionary of Americanisms – Old and New|year=1889|publisher=Reeves and Turner|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=RTdcQOlzjXAC&amp;dq=riding%20on%20a%20rail%20punishment&amp;pg=PA448#v=onepage&amp;q=riding%20on%20a%20rail%20punishment&amp;f=false|author=John S Farmer|accessdate=21 September 2010|location=London|page=448}}&lt;/ref&gt; intended to show community displeasure with the offender so they either conformed their behavior to the mob's demands or left the community.

A story attributed to [[Abraham Lincoln]] has him quoting a victim of being ridden out of town on a rail as having said, "If it weren't for the honor of the thing, I'd just as soon it happened to someone else."&lt;ref name="Cuomo"&gt;{{cite journal |title=Abraham Lincoln and Our "Unfinished Work" |first1=Governor Mario M. |last1=Cuomo |work=Journal of the [[Abraham Lincoln Association]] |volume=8 |issue= 1 |year=1986 |url=http://hdl.handle.net/2027/spo.2629860.0008.106 |accessdate=28 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the film ''[[O Brother, Where Art Thou?]]'', Homer Stokes denounces the [[O_Brother,_Where_Art_Thou%3F#Soggy_Bottom_Boys|Soggy Bottom Boys]] as hostile to the social order, but the crowd is unimpressed and runs him out of town on a rail.

The term '''sense of place''' has been used in many different ways. It is a characteristic that some geographic [[Location (geography)|places]] have and some do not,&lt;ref name="Yi-Fu"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Tuan|first1=Yi-Fu|title=Space and place: The perspective of experience|date=1977|publisher=University of Minnesota press|location=Minneapolis}}&lt;/ref&gt; while to others it is a feeling or perception held by people (not by the place itself).&lt;ref name="Agnew"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Agnew|first1=J.A.|last2=Duncan|first2=J.S.|title=The power of place: Bringing together geographical and sociological imaginations|date=1989|publisher=Unwin Hyman Publishers|location=Boston}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Altman"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Altman, ed.|first1=I.|last2=Low, ed.|first2=S.M.|title=Place attachment. Human behavior and environment: Advances in theory and research|date=1992|publisher=Plenum Press|location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It is often used in relation to those characteristics that make a place special or unique, as well as to those that foster a sense of authentic human attachment and belonging.&lt;ref name="Casey 1"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Casey|first1=E.S.|title=Between geography and philosophy: what does it mean to be in place world?|journal=Annals of the Association of American Geographers|date=2001|volume=91|pages=683–693|doi=10.1111/0004-5608.00266}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Others, such as geographer [[Yi-Fu Tuan]], have pointed to senses of place that are not "positive," such as fear.&lt;ref&gt;Tuan, Yi-Fu (1980). ''Landscapes of Fear''. Oxford: Basil Blackwell.&lt;/ref&gt;  Some students and educators engage in "[[place-based education]]" in order to improve their "sense(s) of place," as well as to use various aspects of place as educational tools in general.&lt;ref&gt;Simandan, D. 2013.

==Geographic place==

[[Cultural geography|Cultural geographers]], [[anthropologists]], [[sociologists]] and [[urban planners]] study why certain places hold special meaning to particular people or animals.&lt;ref name="Spretnak"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Spretnak|first1=C.|title=The resurgence of the real: Body, nature and place in a hypermodern world|date=1997|publisher=Addison-Wesley Publishers|location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt; Places said to have a strong "sense of place" have a strong [[identity (social science)|identity]]  that is deeply felt by inhabitants and visitors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Bloom|first1=W.|title=Personal identity, national identity and international relations|date=1990|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=Cambridge}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Allen"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Allen|first1=J.|last2=Massey|first2=D.|last3=Cochrane|first3=A.|title=Rethinking the Region|date=1998|publisher=Routledge|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sense of place is a social [[phenomenon]].&lt;ref name="Agnew 2"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Agnew|first1=J.|title=Making political geography|date=2002|publisher=Arnold Press|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; Codes aimed at protecting, preserving and enhancing places felt to be of value include "[[World Heritage Site]]" designations, the British "[[Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty]]" controls and the American "[[National Historic Landmark]]" designation.

==Placelessness==

Places that lack a "sense of place" are sometimes referred to as "placeless" or "inauthentic”;cultural geographer, Edward Relph investigates the "placelessness" of these locations&lt;ref&gt;Relph, Edward, Place and Placelessness&lt;/ref&gt; anthropologist [[Marc Augé]] calls these "non-places."&lt;ref name="Augé"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Augé|first1=Marc|title=Non-Places: Introduction to an Anthropology of Supermodernity|date=1995|publisher=Verson Books|location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Stepping against the kind of reductive thinking that placelessness can lead to, in his book, The Practice of Everyday Life, Jesuit philosopher [[Michel de Certeau]] argues that another way of seeing placelessness is to see it as space. For de Certeau,"space is merely composed of intersections of mobile elements" that are not in stasis (117). Place, on the other hand, is space that has been ordered in some way to serve some human need"(117). A park, for instance, is a place that has been constructed "in accord with which elements are distributed in relationships of coexistence"(117) and therefore "implies an indication of stability"(117). de Certeau's ideas became instrumental in understanding the intersections of power and social relations in the construction of place. For de Certeau, placelessness, or "space" was a site for freedom or at least it is the site for what Timotheus Vermeulen sees as "potentially anarchic movement"&lt;ref&gt;https://frieze.com/article/space-place&lt;/ref&gt;    Outside of de Certeau's ideas, Placeless landscapes are seen as those that have no special relationship to the places in which they are located—they could be anywhere; roadside strip [[shopping mall]]s, [[filling stations|gas/petrol stations]] and [[convenience store]]s, [[fast food]] chains, and chain [[department store]]s have been cited as examples of placeless landscape elements.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Davis|first1=Mike|title=City of Quartz: Excavating the Future in Los Angeles|date=1990|publisher=Vintage Press, Penquin Books|location=New York|isbn=9780679738060}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Some historic sites or districts that have been heavily commercialized for [[tourism]] and new housing estates are defined as having lost their sense of place.&lt;ref name="Harvey 1"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Harvey|first1=D.C.|title=From space to place and back again: reflections on the condition of post modernity|date=1993|publisher=Routledge|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Gertrude Stein]]'s "there is no there there" has been used as a description of such places.&lt;ref&gt;''Anyone's Autobiography'', 1937: see [[Gertrude Stein]].&lt;/ref&gt;

Human geographers and social psychologists have studied how a sense of place develops, including the importance of comparisons between places, learning from elders and observing natural disasters and other events.  Of particular note is the importance of childhood experiences.&lt;ref&gt;Measham TG (2006) Learning about environments: The significance of primal landscapes, Environmental Management 38(3), pp. 426–434&lt;/ref&gt;  Environmental psychologists have quantified links between exposure to natural environments in childhood and environmental preferences later in life.&lt;ref&gt;Bixler, R. D., M. F. Floyd, and W. E. Hammitt. (2002). Environmental socialization: Quantitative tests of the childhood play hypothesis, Environment and Behavior 34(6) pp. 795–818&lt;/ref&gt; Learning about surrounding environments during childhood is strongly influenced by the direct experience of playing, as well as through the role of family, culture, and community.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Derr | first1 = V | year = 2002 | title = Children's sense of place in northern New Mexico | url = | journal = Journal of Environmental Psychology | volume = 22 | issue = 1–2| pages = 125–137 | doi=10.1006/jevp.2002.0252}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The special bond which develops between children and their childhood environments has been called a "primal landscape" by human geographers.&lt;ref&gt;Gayton (1996) Landscapes of the Interior: Re-explorations of Nature and the Human Spirit. Gabriola Island, Canada: New Society Publishers&lt;/ref&gt; This childhood landscape forms part of an individual's identity and constitutes a key point of comparison for considering subsequent places later in life. As people move around as adults, they tend to consider new places in relation to this baseline landscape experienced during childhood.&lt;ref&gt;Measham, TG (2007) Primal Landscapes: insights for education from empirical research on ways of learning about environments, International Research in Geographical and Environmental Education 16 (4) pp. 339–350&lt;/ref&gt; Sense of place is used as  a model for community-based psychosocial support programs.&lt;ref&gt;Prewitt Diaz, J.O. and Dayal, A.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1862">In mathematics, a '''set function''' is a [[Function (mathematics)|function]] whose input is a [[Set (mathematics)|set]].  The output is usually a number.  Often the input is a set of [[real number]]s, a set of points in [[Euclidean space]], or a set of points in some [[measure space]].  

== Examples ==

Examples of set functions include:
* The function that assigns to each set its [[cardinality]], i.e. the number of members of the set, is a set function.
* The function
:: &lt;math&gt; d(A) = \lim_{n\to\infty} \frac{|A \cap \{1,\dots,n\}|}{n}, &lt;/math&gt;
: assigning [[Schnirelmann density|densities]] to sufficiently [[well-behaved]] subsets ''A''&amp;nbsp;⊆&amp;nbsp;{1,&amp;nbsp;2,&amp;nbsp;3,&amp;nbsp;...}, is a set function.
* The [[Lebesgue measure]] is a set function that assigns a non-negative real number to any set of real numbers, that is in Lebesgue &lt;math&gt; \sigma &lt;/math&gt;-algebra. (Kolmogorov and Fomin 1975)
* A [[probability measure]] assigns a probability to each set in a [[sigma-algebra|σ-algebra]]. Specifically, the probability of the [[empty set]] is zero and the probability of the [[sample space]] is 1, with other sets given probabilities between 0 and&amp;nbsp;1.
* A possibility measure assigns a number between zero and one to each set in the [[powerset]] of some given set. See [[possibility theory]].
* A Random set is a set-valued [[random variable]]. See [[Random compact set]].

{{Feminism sidebar}}
The term '''sex workers' rights''' encompasses a variety of aims being pursued globally by individuals and organizations that specifically involve the [[Human rights|human]], [[right to health|health]], and [[labor rights]] of [[sex workers]] and their clients. The goals of these movements are diverse, but generally aim to decriminalize and destigmatize [[sex work]], and ensure fair treatment before legal and cultural forces on a local and international level for all persons in the [[sex industry]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Shah|first=Svati P.|title=Sex Work and Women's Movements|journal=CREA Publication|year=2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term ''sex work'' refers primarily to [[prostitution]], but also encompasses [[adult video]] performers, [[phone sex]] operators, [[webcam model]]s, dancers in [[strip club]]s, and others who provide sexually-related services. Some extend the use of the term to include "support personnel" such as managers, agents, videographers, club [[bouncer (doorman)|bouncers]], and others. The debate over sex work is often characterized as an issue of [[women's rights|''women's'' rights]], especially by those who argue that prostitution is inherently oppressive and seek to criminalize it or keep it illegal, but in fact, there are also many male and [[non-binary gender|non-binary]] individuals engaged in providing sexual services. Most sex workers do not wish to be branded as criminals and regard laws against prostitution, pornography, and other parts of the sex industry as violating their rights.

Since the use of red umbrellas by sex workers in [[Venice]], Italy, in 2001—as part of the 49th [[Venice Biennale]] of Art—a red umbrella has become the foremost internationally recognized symbol for sex worker rights.

==Views==
===Discrimination and stigmatization===
In most countries, even those where sex work is legal, [[sex workers]] of all kinds feel that they are stigmatized and marginalized, and that this prevents them from seeking legal redress for discrimination (for e. g., [[racial discrimination]] by a [[strip club]] owner, dismissal from a teaching position because of involvement in the sex industry), non-payment by a [[Customer|client]], [[assault]], or [[rape]]. Activists also believe that clients of sex workers may also be stigmatized and marginalized, in some cases even more so than sex workers themselves. For instance, in Sweden, Norway, and Iceland, it is illegal to buy sexual acts, but not to sell them (the buyer is said to have committed a crime, but not the prostitute).&lt;ref name="Prostitution in Sweden"&gt;Prostitution in Sweden|"The laws on prostitution in Sweden make it illegal to buy sexual services, but not to sell them."&lt;/ref&gt;

===Pornography debates===
During the 1970s and 1980s, the main topics in feminist discourse on women's sexuality were [[pornography]], [[prostitution]], and [[human trafficking]]. This led to the birth of the mobilization for sex worker rights in America. [[Carol Leigh]] is credited with coining the term "sex work" in the early 1980s and it was later popularized by a book published in 1989 called ''Sex Work''.&lt;ref name=swaay&gt;{{cite web|title=History|url=http://www.swaay.org/history.html|work=SWAAY|publisher=SWAAY.org|accessdate=13 March 2014|year=2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Around this time, pornography in particular was a prominent debate among feminists campaigning for women's rights. The feminists involved in these debates held opposing views on how to eliminate sexual violence against women, and those involved were either classified as "liberal feminists" or "radical feminists". A third group of feminists is described as "pro-sex" or "[[sex positive feminism]]", and this view is considered the true feminist defense of pornography.&lt;ref name=McElroy&gt;{{cite web|last=McElroy|first=Wendy|title=A Feminist Defense of Pornography|url=http://www.secularhumanism.org/library/fi/mcelroy_17_4.html|work=Free Inquiry Magazine, Vol. 17, No. 4|accessdate=18 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Radical feminist====
The argument of the radical side rests upon the premise that pornography depicts women as subordinates and perpetrates violence against women.&lt;ref name=flood/&gt; Some of the main anti-porn feminists involved in the debates included Page Mellish, [[Andrea Dworkin]], and [[Catharine MacKinnon]]. Dworkin insisted that the oppression of women occurs through sexual subordination, and that in order for [[gender]] equality to exist, subordination must be eliminated. Thus, she states that pornography and prostitution are incompatible with gender equality.&lt;ref name=flood&gt;{{cite book|last=Dworkin|first=Andrea|title=Against the Male Flood: Censorship, Pornography, and Equity|year=1985}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, MacKinnon states that [[pornography]] is an act of sexual violence.&lt;ref name=onlywords&gt;{{cite book|last=MacKinnon|first=Catharine A.|title=Only Words|year=1993|publisher=Harvard University Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the grounds that pornography violated women's [[civil rights]], she and Dworkin proposed a law named the "Anti-Pornography Civil Rights Ordinance" that allowed women to seek reparations for damages done by pornography through civil courts. Likewise, Page Mellish, the founder of [[Feminists Fighting Pornography]] (FFP), believed that issues facing feminists were rooted in pornography. Mellish allied with conservatives in 1992 to fight for the passing of the "Pornography Victims' Compensation Act", which was modeled after Dworkin and MacKinnon's ordinance.&lt;ref name=sexexposed&gt;{{cite book|last=Segal|first=Lynn|title=Sex Exposed: Sexuality and the Pornography Debate|year=1993|publisher=Rutgers University Press|location=USA}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Liberal feminist====
Contrarily, liberal feminists believe that capitalism allows women to freely make whatever choices they desire. As such, some women freely choose to participate in pornography, as they do in other forms of labour. The main thing that these feminists fight for is anti-censorship, regardless of whether they personally agree with pornography or not.&lt;ref name="McElroy" /&gt; On this side of the debate are feminists such as [[Gayle Rubin]] and Lynn Chancer. Rubin argues that anti-pornography laws could negatively harm sexual minorities such as gays/lesbians, sex workers, and feminists because they would create new problems and modes of abuse resulting from the anti-pornography side's use of a limited amount of porn that demonstrates the most extreme cases of violence such as [[sadomasochism]].&lt;ref name=rubin&gt;{{cite book|last=Rubin|first=Gayle|title=Misguided, Dangerous, and Wrong: an Analysis of Anti-pornography Politics}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=thinkingsex&gt;{{cite book|last=Rubin|first=Gayle|title=Thinking Sex: Notes for a Radical Theory of the Politics of Sexuality}}&lt;/ref&gt; Likewise, Chancer argues that it is possible for such imagery to be able to circulate consensually and lawfully while genuine feelings of pleasure are being experienced without women feeling subordinated.&lt;ref name=chancerporn&gt;{{cite journal|last=Chancer|first=Lynn|title=From Pornography to Sadomasochism: Reconciling Feminist Differences|journal=Annals of the American Academy of Political and Social Science|date=September 2000|volume=571|pages=77–88|doi=10.1177/0002716200571001006}}&lt;/ref&gt; She also states that some of these feminists believe that pornography is negatively affecting women by leading to violence against women when in actuality it is not. Thus, she concludes that radical feminists are looking at pornography as a quick fix to a much larger societal problem.&lt;ref name=defendingpornography&gt;{{cite journal|last=Lynn|first=Chancer|title=Feminist Offensives: "Defending Pornography" and the Splitting of Sex from Sexism|journal=Stanford Law Review|date=February 1996|volume=48|issue=3|pages=739–760}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Sex-positive feminist====
Sex-positive feminists believe that no form of sexual expression should be vilified, except that which is not consensual.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Ryan|first=Barbara|title=Identity politics in the women's movement|year=2001|publisher=NYU Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; One of the main advocates of this feminist perspective is [[Carol Queen]]. She argues that radical feminists probably generalize too widely as far as women are concerned, and do not take into consideration more complicated circumstances such as [[sadomasochism]] and [[prostitution]]. Elisa Glick also states that configurations of power within relationships do not prevent women from exercising it and that they can be used to enable women to exercise it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Glick|first=Elisa|title=Sex Positive: Feminism, Queer Theory, and the Politics of Transgression|journal=Feminist Review|date=Spring 2000|volume=64|pages=19–45|doi=10.1080/014177800338936}}&lt;/ref&gt;
====Men on Porn====
There is debate on whether the consumption of porn among men is good for their well being, though in a study of over 300 men aged 18 to 73 97% report that they have watched porn, with 94% reporting having done so in the last 6 months and 82% reporting doing so in a manner they would consider "regularly".
Men of all ages report an overall positive experience with porn, though younger men express greater negative than older men- which researchers speculate is because porn skews their perceptions of sex.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Miller |first1=Dan J. |last2=Hald |first2=Gert Martin |last3=Kidd |first3=Garry |title=Self-perceived effects of pornography consumption among heterosexual men. |journal=Psychology of Men &amp; Masculinity |date=July 2018 |volume=19 |issue=3 |pages=469–476 |doi=10.1037/men0000112 |accessdate=21 November 2018|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/316802453}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==="Sex Wars" debate===
Pornography debates provided leeway for the emergence of the "Sex Wars" debates, a title assigned by feminist scholars. These debates began in the 1980s and centered upon ways that women were depicted in [[heterosexual]] sexual relations. The main premise of the [[anti-pornography movement]] rests upon the argument that pornography is degrading and [[violent]] towards women. These [[feminists]] also believe that pornography encourages men to behave violently towards women.&lt;ref name=flood /&gt; However, liberal feminists argued that this argument does not take into account the pleasure that women can experience, stating that these arguments could backfire against women and actually subject them to a greater degree of subordination.&lt;ref name=rubin /&gt;

Thus, the debates started to become centralized on the role of [[dominance and submission|dominance]] within heterosexual relationships and how this dominance is transferred to other areas of women’s lives. These theories of male sexuality and female objectification and sexuality are controversial because they framed later debates about [[human trafficking]], in which coerced workers are distinguished from voluntary workers.&lt;ref name=sexwars&gt;{{cite journal|last=Abrams|first=Kathryn|title=Sex Wars Redux: Agency and Coercion in Feminist Legal Theory|journal=Berkeley Law Scholarship Repository|date=January 1995|pages=304–376}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Human trafficking====
{{unreferenced section|date=February 2014}}
The human trafficking debate, a prominent discourse in the 21st century, has materialized as a result of the movement. Current debates center on whether the best way to protect women would be through abolition, criminalization, decriminalization, or legalization.

=====Legalization=====
Sex worker advocates who are fighting for legalization or decriminalization of prostitution contend that criminalizing consensual sex acts among adults creates a black market which worsens the problem of forced human trafficking rather than reducing it. They decry the paternalistic attitude of what they disparagingly call "rescue missions", law enforcement raids that regard all sex workers as in need of "saving" fail to distinguish the minority of sex workers who are coerced from the vast majority who engage in sex work voluntarily.&lt;ref name=urbanjustice&gt;{{cite web|title=Working Group on Sex Work and Human Rights|url=http://esplerp.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/Urban-Justice-Difference-between.pdf|work=Urban Justice|accessdate=18 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, liberal feminists such as [[Ronald Weitzer]] and [[Gayle Rubin]], argue that the definition of sex work as inherently violent has created a “moral panic” that influences political discourse.&lt;ref name=thinkingsex /&gt;&lt;ref name="Moral Panic" /&gt; They contend that this "panic" has led to the construction of a trafficking victim who may actually be a [[Migrant sex work|woman migrating for work]]. These feminists argue that this can backfire because it does not protect those women who voluntarily enter into sex work.&lt;ref name=urbanjustice /&gt;

=====Criminalization=====
Opponents of the sex workers' rights movement, such as [[Melissa Farley]] and [[Janice Raymond]], argue that prostitution should be abolished because legalization can increase incidences of human trafficking. The ''New UN Trafficking Protocol'' by Raymond argues that many victims are trafficked to countries in which sex work is legalized or decriminalized, and because they are trafficked under the guise of migrants they are not protected. Raymond also argues that it is impossible to separate the exploitation experienced by local prostitutes from the exploitative experiences of trafficked prostitutes, as they are very similar. Thus, to end sex slavery, the report declares that everyone involved in sex work needs to be criminalized so that the industry can be abolished.&lt;ref name=traffickingprotocol&gt;{{Cite journal | last = Raymond | first = Janice G. | author-link = Janice Raymond | title = The new UN trafficking protocol | journal = [[Women's Studies International Forum]] | volume = 25 | issue = 5 | pages = 491–502 | doi = 10.1016/S0277-5395(02)00320-5 | date = September–October 2002 | ref = harv }}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, Farley argues that engagement in voluntary sex work is a decision made by women in the absence of alternative choices,&lt;ref name="Farley, Melissa" /&gt; and that it therefore cannot accurately be described as a voluntary and freely made choice.

==Legality of prostitution==
Most activists campaigning for the formation of policies that protect sex workers from violence fall into two main categories: abolitionism or criminalization, and legalization or [[decriminalization]].&lt;ref name="Brents and Hausbeck"&gt;Brents, Barbara G. and Hausbeck, Kathryn. "Violence and Legalized Prostitution in Nevada: Examining Safety, Risk and Prostitution Policy". ''Journal of Interpersonal Violence''. 2005&lt;/ref&gt;

===Abolitionism or criminalization===
Early reformers identified the key problem with prostitution as male [[lust]] that lured innocent women into a depraved life as prostitutes.&lt;ref name="Brents and Hausbeck"/&gt; Thus, abolitionist proponents believe that prostitution is an exploitative system that is harmful to the women involved.&lt;ref name="Prostitution Research"&gt;Farley, Melissa. "Myths and Facts about Trafficking for Legal and Illegal Prostitution". Yale Journal of Law and Feminism. May 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, these [[activists]] believe that in order to prevent violence against women, the customers, pimps, and panderers should be punished so that the entire institution can be demolished.&lt;ref name="Hughes, Donna"&gt;Hughes, Donna. "Legalizing Prostitution Will Not Stop the Harm". 1999.&lt;/ref&gt; Because this policy approach is built upon the idea that women are helpless victims, opponents of this view believe that it is paternalistic and not empowering to women.&lt;ref name="Brents and Hausbeck"/&gt;

A study by [[Melissa Farley]], a well-known supporter of the abolition of prostitution, and colleagues, suggests that violence is an intrinsic part of prostitution in which the chances of experiencing violence increases along with the number of years involved in prostitution. This study also concludes that prostitution tends to be multi-traumatic in all forms.&lt;ref name="Nine"&gt;Farley, Melissa et al. "Prostitution and Trafficking in Nine Countries: An Update on Violence and Posttraumatic Stress Disorder".&lt;/ref&gt;
Farley and colleagues also used the [[Netherlands]] as an example of a country to support the idea that legalized prostitution can still inflict harm on those involved. They stated that over 90% of the sex workers tend to show symptoms of [[PTSD]]. Therefore, these proponents advocate for abolitionism and criminalization as a method of protecting sex workers.&lt;ref name="Nine"/&gt;

Criminalization proponents believe that the way to protect women from interpersonal violence is to punish both [[sex workers]] and customers for partaking in the buying and selling of sex.&lt;ref name="Brents and Hausbeck"/&gt;

====Support for criminalization====
Many proponents of abolitionism or criminalization of prostitution commonly use ten reasons based on studies done on the effects of prostitution in countries where it is legalized or decriminalized.&lt;ref name="Janice Raymond "&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.prostitutionresearch.com/ten-reasons.html |title=Ten Reasons for Not Legalizing Prostitution |first=Janice |last=Raymond |date=2003|accessdate=2013-12-28 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081201080826/http://www.prostitutionresearch.com/ten-reasons.html |archivedate=2008-12-01 |df= }}.&lt;/ref&gt;

*Prostitution is a gift to pimps, traffickers, and the sex industry.
*Prostitution promotes [[sex trafficking]].
*Prostitution expands the sex industry instead of controlling it.
*Prostitution increases clandestine, illegal, and street prostitution because many women do not participate in health checks or registration and do not want to be controlled by businessmen.
*Prostitution increases [[child prostitution]].
*Prostitution doesn't protect women in prostitution.
*Prostitution makes it socially acceptable for men to buy sex, and women are viewed as sexual commodities that men are encouraged to partake in.
*Prostitution does not promote women's health because the condom-use policy is not strictly enforced.
*Prostitution does not enhance women's choice.
*Prostitutes do not want the sex industry legalized or decriminalized.&lt;ref name="Janice Raymond" /&gt;

===Legalization or decriminalization===
Legalization or decriminalization proponents, on the other hand, believe that the selling and buying of sex exchange will continue no matter what. Therefore, the only way to effectively prevent violence is to acknowledge this and for government to build policies and laws that deal with the issue through [[regulation]] of the business.&lt;ref name="Brents and Hausbeck"/&gt; Legalization/Decriminalization proponents believe that a system that prohibits prostitution creates an [[oppressive]] environment for prostitutes.&lt;ref name="Kempadoo, Kamala"&gt;Kempadoo, Kamala. "Globalizing Sex Workers' Rights" ''Canadian Women's Studies''. 2003.&lt;/ref&gt; Proponents of this view also recommend that policies are built that places restrictions on trafficking and exploitation of sex workers.&lt;ref name="Misra, Geetanjali, Mahal, Ajay, Shah, Rima"&gt;Geetanjali, Misra et al. "Protecting the Rights of Sex Workers: The Indian Experience". ''Health and Human Rights''. 2000.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Support for decriminalization====
The legalization of sex work often entails additional restrictions and requirements placed on [[sex workers]] as well as registering with official government offices. Additionally, many activists favor decriminalization over legalization. Decriminalization involves a focus on laws which protect the rights of sex workers, such as those against coercion into or to stay in sex work, while all consensual sexual contact between adult sex workers and adult clients would not be criminalized.&lt;ref name="Brents and Hausbeck"/&gt;

Ronald Weitzer, a well-known proponent for the legalization/decriminalization of prostitution, stated that the use of nonscientific evidence about prostitution has contributed to a "moral panic" because opponents commonly use the argument that prostitution is inherently violent and unable to be regulated. However, he also claims that other governments have been able to reject this notion and find ways to regulate it and uses Nevada as an example.&lt;ref name="Moral Panic"&gt;Weitzer, Ronald. "The Growing Moral Panic Over Prostitution and Sex Trafficking". ''The Criminologist''. 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;

Below are some of the main premises that the pro-legalization and pro-decriminalization of prostitution movement rests upon.&lt;ref name="ProCon"&gt;{{cite web |title=Top 10 Pro &amp; Con Arguments |url=http://prostitution.procon.org/view.resource.php?resourceID=000115 |website=prostitution.procon.org |accessdate=24 November 2018 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Prostitution is a transaction where no one is harmed, and the persons involved are consenting adults.
*Prostitution is a free choice.
*Sex work is no more [[moral]] or [[immoral]] than other jobs.
*[[Sex trafficking]] and coercion into the industry can be effectively reduced if sex work is legalized or decriminalized.
*Decriminalization or legalization can protect sex workers from violence most effectively.
*The spread of [[diseases]] can be hindered through the legalization or decriminalization of prostitution.
*The rates of [[rape]] could decrease if prostitution were legalized or decriminalized.
*Sex work could become a legal business, and [[human rights]] and [[worker's rights]] could be enforced by effective regulation.
*Prostitution is a career option in which the [[free market]] is being taken advantage of and women's claims over their own bodies.
*The criminalization of sex workers only exacerbates problems that they are already facing. Therefore, the decriminalization or legalization can be a starting point to addressing these issues.&lt;ref name="ProCon"/&gt;

==Employment==
Depending on regional law, sex workers' activities may be regulated, controlled, tolerated, or prohibited. For example, [[prostitution]] is illegal in many countries, but it is fully legalized in several jurisdictions, including the Netherlands, [[Germany]], some [[Australian]] states, and several counties in the US state of [[Nevada]].

===Strip club employment issues===
In both Canada and the UK, dancers in [[strip clubs]] are [[independent contractors]] who face significant problems that they are unable to rectify because of their inability to challenge employers through organized action.&lt;ref name="Sanders and Hardy"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Now"&gt;{{cite web|title=Bylaws on my stripper's body|url=http://www.nowtoronto.com/news/story.cfm?content=189480|work=NOW Magazine|publisher=In Print|accessdate=9 March 2014|author=Brigitte Benoit|date=1–8 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Lab"&gt;{{cite web|title=Sex Work, the Law and the Labour Movement|url=http://rankandfile.ca/?p=2063|website=RankandFile.ca|accessdate=9 March 2014|author=Kaley Kennedy|date=7 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Entry fees====
In the UK, a study was conducted which inquired about dancers’ experiences to get a better understanding to determine whether or not it could be costly for women to work some nights. It stated that often when the [[Strip club|club]] offered promotions with gimmicks, dancers would be required to work without payment. Furthermore, dancers may be required to promote events without pay as part of the house rules. If they tried to complain, the club owners would threaten to dismiss them. Thus, the study suggests that strip club workers in the UK operate under vulnerable conditions without the capacity to organize for better working conditions. Moreover, the study states that dancers are also required to pay their “house moms” and the DJs, as well as being pressured to buy drinks for their customers and other dancers, which hampers their profit-making ability.&lt;ref name="Sanders and Hardy"&gt;Sanders, Teela and Hardy, Kate. "Devalued, Deskilled, and Diversified: Explaining the Proliferation of the Strip Industry in the UK" ''The British Journal of Sociology''.&lt;/ref&gt;

====House fees====
The fees of dancers’ house fees can be large and sometimes they are not waived or lowered when business is slow. Also, clubs may continue to hire women even during bad economic downturns. Therefore, dancers feel that their earning potential is lowered.&lt;ref name="Sanders and Hardy"/&gt;

====Commission====
In addition to house fees and entry fees, many dancers are not paid for their stage shows because they are considered a part of self-advertisement. This is also considered another rule that comes along with their job description. In the UK, the club generally takes thirty percent commission.&lt;ref name="Sanders and Hardy"/&gt;

====Fines and tips====
The final way clubs make money is through [[fine (penalty)|fine]]s and [[tip (gratuity)|tip]]s. This study found that there could be a fine for something such as chewing gum or having gum in a bag that ranges from twenty to thirty pounds. The most common fines were chewing gum, using cellular phones on the floor, and tardiness. It goes on to say that some dancers may have to pay to take time off. Dancers also tip people that work in the club such as waitresses and doormen in order to get them to direct customers to them. Other reasons that motivate dancers to tip include tipping security so that the dancers will not be fined and tipping DJs to be called during good song and opportune times.&lt;ref name="Sanders and Hardy"/&gt;

====Registration process====
In the Canadian city of [[Toronto]], workers must be in possession of an adult entertainer license that is only provided following a criminal record check and the submission of a form. Applicants are initially charged about [[Canadian dollar|C$]]$400 and are required to pay an annual C$270 renewal fee. Municipal bylaws govern the standards that workers must abide by to maintain their license.&lt;ref name="Lab" /&gt;

====Unlawful or inappropriate customer behavior====
A survey undertaken by the Toronto city council in 2012 was for the purpose informing a reconsideration of the regulations around licensing for strip club-based sex workers. The most significant aspect was a reappraisal of the “no touching” rule so that it specified areas of the body to prevent people being fined in the event of acceptable casual physical contact. Of those sex workers who responded to the survey, 67 percent stated that they had been sexually assaulted or touched without their consent, while they further documented the responses from their employers: 2 percent called the police, 34 percent asked the customer to leave, 22 percent ignored the incident, 4 percent blamed the stripper and 14 percent dismissed the incidents as part of the job.&lt;ref name="Now" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Lab" /&gt;

===By country===

====Argentina====
The Association of Women Prostitutes of Argentina (AMMAR) was started by Elena Reynaga, who now heads the South American sex workers' network RedTraSex.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ladiaria.com.uy/articulo/2016/8/feministas-somos-todas/ Feministas somos todas], 11 August 2016, La Diaria, Retrieved 7 November 2016&lt;/ref&gt; AMMAR leader Sandra Cabrera was killed for her activism in 2004.&lt;ref name=ammar&gt;[http://www.redtrasex.org/spip.php?page=imprimir_articulo&amp;id_article=568 AMMAR remembered Sandra Cabrera], 6 June 2012, redtrasex.org, Retrieved 3 September 2016&lt;/ref&gt;

====India====
On March 10, 2014, the All India Network of Sex Workers, an umbrella group of sex worker organizations, campaigned for pension rights. Representative of 90 sex worker organisations across 16 Indian states, the Network presented a letter explaining that sex workers in India are not treated equally in social security terms, stating: "Sex workers, including their family members, can't access various social entitlements which are offered to citizens in general. We consider sex work like any other occupation belonging to the unorganised sector and we should be brought under the universal pension scheme." A spokesperson for the Network also informed the media that sex workers in India retire "by the age of 40-45 years", an earlier age than the broader population.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Sex workers demand basic rights, inclusion in voters list|url=http://www.business-standard.com/article/news-ians/sex-workers-demand-basic-rights-inclusion-in-voters-list-114030300826_1.html|accessdate=14 March 2014|newspaper=Business Standard|date=3 March 2014|author=IANS}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Netherlands====
A study by [[Janice Raymond]] states that there can be many detrimental consequences to legalizing and decriminalizing prostitution. One consequence mentioned was that prostitution can be seen as a suitable and normal option for the poor. Therefore, poor women can be easily exploited when there is a lack of sexual services which does not lead to their empowerment.&lt;ref name="Raymond, Janice "&gt;Raymond, Janice. "Prostitution on Demand: Legalizing the Buyers as Sexual Customers". ''Violence Against Women''. 2004.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Melissa Farley]] supported this idea with an analysis stating that most women do not rationally decide to enter prostitution; rather, the decision is made as a survival choice and that there are certain circumstances can drive women into the field of prostitution, leaving them with a choice that is more along the lines of voluntary [[slavery]]. Thus, it is merely used as a surviving strategy.&lt;ref name="Farley, Melissa"&gt;Farley, Melissa. "Prostitution, Trafficking, and Cultural Amnesia: What We Must Not Know to Keep the Business of Sexual Exploitation Running Smoothly". ''Yale Journal of Law and Feminism''. 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

Furthermore, Raymond states that businesses in the sex industry are able to offer services to any men which has led to more [[gender inequality]] because women have to accept that prostitution is a new norm. She supported this by saying that even [[disabled]] men are able to receive sexual services, and their [[caregivers]] (mostly women) are required to take them to these establishments and assist them in engaging in sexual acts. Another consequence Raymond mentioned was that child prostitution has increased in the [[Netherlands]]. She suggests this is because the Netherlands has created a prostitution-promoting environment through laws concerning children that make it easier for abusers to use children without penalty. She also adds that the distinction between voluntary and forced prostitution could be detrimental because it can be argued that the thought of someone being forced into prostitution can be exciting for some men because it may be a part of clients' fantasies.&lt;ref name="Raymond, Janice " /&gt; Finally, another study states that the legalization or decriminalization can be detrimental because studies that surveyed sex workers where it is legal concluded that violence is accepted as part of the job with the universal experience of [[Sexual abuse|molestation]] and [[abuse]].&lt;ref name="Farley, Melissa" /&gt;

====United States====

=====Hawaii=====
A decision by the House and the Senate in Hawaii is expected in May 2014 after police agreed in March 2014 not to oppose the revision of a law that was implemented in the 1970s, allowing undercover police officers to engage in sexual relations with sex workers during the course of investigations. Following initial protest from supporters of the legislation, all objections were retracted on March 25, 2014. A Honolulu police spokeswoman informed ''TIME'' magazine that, at the time of the court's decision, no reports had been made in regard to the abuse of the exemption by police, while a Hawaiian senator stated to the media: "I suppose that in retrospect, the police probably feel somewhat embarrassed about this whole situation." However, the Pacifica Alliance to Stop Slavery and other advocates affirmed their knowledge of police brutality in this area and explained that the fear of retribution is the main deterrent for sex workers who seek to report offending officers. At a Hawaiian Senate Judiciary Committee hearing, also in March 2014, an attorney testified that his client was raped three times by Hawaiian police before prostitution was cited as the reason for her subsequent arrest.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Hawaii Police Won’t Get to Have Sex With Prostitutes Anymore|url=http://time.com/38444/hawaii-police-prostitutes-sex/|accessdate=5 April 2014|newspaper=TIME|date=26 March 2014|author=Eliana Dockterman}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=====Nevada=====
Barbara Brents and Kathryn Hausbeck state in their study that the legalization of prostitution in Nevada's brothels allows for improved regulation and protection for both businesses and workers.&lt;ref name="Brents and Hausbeck"/&gt; Academic [[Ronald Weitzer]] supports this idea by citing the impact of the numerous safety measures that ensure the safety of the workers.&lt;ref name="Weitzer, Ronald"&gt;Weitzer, Ronald. Prostitution: Facts and Fiction. ''Contexts''. 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

Brents and Hausbeck's case study of Nevada's brothels entailed examples of how they believe protection mechanisms were designed to account for the entire process of each individual job—that is the time that a sex worker is with a customer. They started by saying that the negotiation process for sex workers in Nevada requires the use of an intercom during the process so that workers will not betray the business [[owners]] and so that owners can know if the customers are putting the workers at risk. After the price is negotiated, the money is paid and taken out of the room by the sex worker. At that point, the sex workers have the opportunity to let [[security guards]] know if there is anything unsafe or uncomfortable about the situation so that security can be alerted. Another protection mechanism requires security to interrupt the workers after the allotted period of time to demand that the customers either leave or renegotiate the price, so that sex workers are not coerced or forced into providing additional services without a fee. Finally, the study concludes that sex workers are offered protection from one another in brothels because of strictly enforced rules and the relationships that brothels have been able to build with local law enforcement officials.&lt;ref name="Brents and Hausbeck"/&gt; According to some legalization supporters, this protection creates an environment that can be empowering for women to work in.&lt;ref name="Weitzer, Ronald"/&gt;

Additionally, proponents argue that workers must also comply with [[health]] regulations and engage in preventative practices. They state that this compliance leads to a system that becomes mutually advantageous for brothels and sex workers, because a perception of safety by workers is profitable for the brothel.&lt;ref name="Brents and Hausbeck"/&gt; In brothels in Nevada, it is a requirement for sex workers to be tested and verified as healthy. Afterwards, they are required to be checked on a periodic basis for certain STIs. [[Condom]] usage is also mandatory and this is advertised by the brothels so that customers know beforehand. Finally, sex workers are able to examine the customers before any services are given to make sure there are no signs of visible STIs. If there are any suspicions, the worker is allowed to refund the customer and refuse service.&lt;ref name="Brents and Hausbeck"/&gt;

==Risks associated with sex work==

===Sexually transmitted infections (STIs)===
In countries where sex work is either criminalized or illegal, or both, sex workers face many potential threats of violence. One major threat of violence is the risk that they may contract a sexually transmitted infection (STI) due to their labor and context-dependent barriers that can be either structural (government) or individual (fear) in nature.&lt;ref name="Karim, Quarraisha A."&gt;Karim, Quarraisha A., et al. "Reducing the Risk of HIV Infection among South African Sex Workers: Socioeconomic and Gender Barriers". ''American Journal of Public Health''. 1995.&lt;/ref&gt; Since street-based violence can be commonplace, this further increases their susceptibility to contracting a disease due to factors such as coercion or rape, as they lack the ability to demand that a condom is used or to refuse service. In addition, the [[World Health Organization]] states that sex workers have been known to be refused health services when seeking out disease prevention and treatment because of the nature of their occupation.&lt;ref name="World Health Organization"&gt;World Health Organization. "Violence against Sex Workers and HIV Prevention". Information Bulletin Series, 3. 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, sex workers are also afraid to seek out health services for problems because of structural barriers that prevent them from knowing about and utilizing services that could teach them better prevention methods.&lt;ref name="Kurtz, Steven P., Surratt, Hilary L., Kiley, Marion C., Inciardi, James A."&gt;Kurtz. Steven P., et al. "Barriers to Health and Social Services for Street-Based Sex Workers". ''Journal of Healthcare for the Poor and Undeserved''. 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;

A particular example of the disease threats sex workers are faced with can be demonstrated via a study conducted in Cambodia where the rate of HIV has increased. This report studied the prevalence of HIV among a group of indirect sex workers in Cambodia called "beer promotion girls", women employed by distributors to promote and sell beers. The study found that they have the highest rate of HIV because they often sell sex as a means of supplementing their salary. This report also found that among indirect sex workers the condom usage rate is lower because they may be getting paid more for sex without condoms. It concluded by explaining how disease prevention campaigns often target direct sex workers, such as those who work in a brothel, and neglect the women in other areas of sex work who are also at risk of contracting STIs.&lt;ref name="Cambodia"&gt;Kim, Andrea A., et al. "High Prevalence of HIV and Sexually Transmitted Infections among Indirect Sex Workers in Cambodia". ''Journal of American Sexually Transmitted Diseases Association''. December 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, advocates of the legalization/decriminalization of prostitution believe policies need to be designed to target any sex worker who may be in a vulnerable position.&lt;ref name="Shannon, Kate, Kerr, Thomas, Allinott, Shari, Chettiar, Jill, Shoveller, Jean, Tyndall, Mark"&gt;Shannon, Kate., et al. "Social and Structural Violence and Power Relations in Mitigating HIV Risk of Drug-Using Women in Survival Sex Work". ''Social Sciences and Medicine''. February 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

Trans women who are sex workers are at particular risk for HIV. The seroprevalence of HIV among trans women sex workers internationally has been estimated at 27.3 percent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Gahagan|first=Jacqueline|title=Women and HIV Protection in Canada: Implications for Research, Policy, and Practise|year=2013|page=158|url=https://books.google.com/?id=Xj3wMM55Pb8C&amp;pg=PA157 |isbn=9780889614864}}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, sex work is prevalent amongst transgender people, particularly young trans women.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hoffman|first=Beth R|year=2014|title=The Interaction of Drug Use, Sex Work, and HIV Among Transgender Women|url=http://eds.b.ebscohost.com/eds/detail/detail?vid=4&amp;sid=c52a63cf-c565-4065-a6ae-93425310bf68%40sessionmgr103&amp;hid=127&amp;bdata=JnNpdGU9ZWRzLWxpdmUmc2NvcGU9c2l0ZQ%3d%3d#AN=95790246&amp;db=s3h|journal=Substance Use &amp; Misuse|volume=49|issue=8|pages=1049–1053|via=SPORTDiscus|doi=10.3109/10826084.2013.855787|pmid=24779504}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Physical violence===
Likewise, the World Health Organization report says that criminalization creates an environment where women are less likely to report crimes against them, and accept the possibility of violence such as rape, [[murder]], beatings, and [[kidnapping]] as a part of the job description. The report also states that sex workers are even at risk of being harassed, humiliated, and coerced into sex with local [[law enforcement]].&lt;ref name="World Health Organization"/&gt; Although these are some of the common threats that both decriminalizing/legalizing and criminalizing/decriminalizing prostitution hope to address and reduce, another study concludes that the rates of victimization of prostitutes are not nearly as high as some studies claim.&lt;ref name="Weitzer"&gt;Weitzer, Ronald. "The Social Construction of Sex Trafficking: Ideology and Institutionalization of a Moral Crusade". ''Politics and Society. 2007''.&lt;/ref&gt;

On April 11, 2018, the [[United States Congress]] passed the [[Stop Enabling Sex Traffickers Act]], commonly known as FOSTA-SESTA, which imposes severe penalties on online platforms that facilitate [[sex work]]. The act resulted in the closure of the classified advertising website [[Backpage]] and led to the arrest of its founders. The effectiveness of the act has come into question and there have been allegations that it has endangered [[sex workers]] and has been ineffective in catching and stopping [[sex traffickers]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20180509/13450339810/police-realizing-that-sesta-fosta-made-their-jobs-harder-sex-traffickers-realizing-made-their-job-easier.shtml|title=Police Realizing That SESTA/FOSTA Made Their Jobs Harder; Sex Traffickers Realizing It's Made Their Job Easier|website=Techdirt|author=Mike Masnick|date=14 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Psychological violence===
Some sex workers are subjected to psychological manipulation by their [[pimps]] using a mix of violence and tenderness. Sex workers in these relationships can develop [[stockholm syndrome]] toward their abusers and refuse to testify against them. [[New York County District Attorney]] [[Cyrus Vance, Jr.]] said that such sex workers "are often emotionally and economically dependent upon their abusers, and remain silent as their worlds grow smaller and more dangerous".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite newspaper|url=https://kristof.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/05/03/stockholm-syndrome-in-the-pimp-victim-relationship/|title=Stockholm Syndrome in the Pimp-Victim Relationship|newspaper=The New York Times|author=Natalie Kitroeff|date=3 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Advocacy==
''Information about unionization of sex work and non-governmental organizations: [[Sex worker|Sex worker:Advocacy]]''

[[:Category: Sex worker activists|Sex worker activists]] and [[advocates]], including many [[libertarian]] organizations such as the [[Reason Foundation]] and the [[Libertarian Party (United States)|Libertarian Party]] in the United States, argue that sex workers should have the same basic human and labor rights as other working people.&lt;ref&gt;Weitzer, Ronald. "Prostitutes' Rights in the United States", ''Sociological Quarterly''. 1991.&lt;/ref&gt; According to Jacqueline Comte, there are three different stances when it comes to the issues around sex work: [[International Abolitionist Federation|abolitionism]], [[sex-positive feminism]], and [[decriminalization]]. She argues that decriminalization is the best stance based on her found research. This will allow for better working conditions, police protection, and less violence against sex workers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| last= Comte| first= Jacqueline| date= March 2014| title= Decriminalization of Sex Work: Feminist Discourse in Light of Research| journal= Sexuality &amp; Culture| volume= 18| issue= 1| pages= 196–217| doi= 10.1007/s12119-013-9174-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 2014, the Government of Canada tried to pass Bill C. 36, which would criminalize the purchase or advertising of sexual services. Organizations like [http://www.chezstella.org Stella L'amie de Maimie], tried to put pressure to vote against the bill. This is an organization that is fighting for sex workers to have a voice and to have the same rights to health and security as everyone else. They argue that [[criminalization]] will have negative impacts, like increased violence, more coercion, and human trafficking. Part of this organization is about free condom distribution and information and tools by and for sex workers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://chezstella.org/| title= Stella: Making Space for Working Women| location= Montreal, Quebec, Canada| website= Stella l'amie de maimie| access-date= March 5, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Sonagachi]] is a project in India that is well known for its [[HIV/AIDS|HIV]] prevention. They promote consistent condom use which has resulted in significant decreases in [[Sexually transmitted infection|Sexually transmitted infection (STI)]]. This project's focus is on promoting and protecting sex worker's human and labor rights.

The three tactics that they, and other advocate groups, use for their goal is:
* Peer education between sex workers focused on raising awareness regarding STIs.
* Condom distribution (free or social marketing).
* Promotion and offering of STI screening, treatment, and management.

Similarly to [http://www.chezstella.org Stella] and other organizations like [http://sexworkersproject.org Urban Justice Center], [[Sonagachi]] wants to give a voice to sex workers because they know what is best for them and what needs to be improved. The principle of these organizations is that sex work is a job, and it should be respected just like any other job.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| last1= Kerrigan| first1=Deanna L.| last2= Fonner| first2=Virginia A.| last3= Stromdahl| first3=Susanne| last4= Kennedy| first4= Caitlin E.| date=2013| title= Community empowerment among female sex workers is an effective HIV prevention intervention: a systematic review of the peer-reviewed evidence from low-and middle-income countries.| journal= AIDS and Behavior| volume= 17| issue= 6| pages= 1926–1940| doi=10.1007/s10461-013-0458-4| pmid=23539185}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another viewpoint that some activists take is [[legalization]], which would allow sex workers to undertake their work in improved, organized circumstances (e. g., legal brothels), where standard industry practices (e. g., practicing condom use and regular health check-ups for sex workers) could reduce the transmission of HIV and other STIs.&lt;ref name="Ditmore, Melissa"&gt;{{cite news| url=http://newsweek.washingtonpost.com/postglobal/needtoknow/2007/02/debating_legalized_prostitutio.html | work=The Washington Post | title=Need to Know}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many sex workers are asking for their work to be decriminalized and legalized to facilitate them seeking help if they are victims of violence. The advocacy groups are the voices to push countries to make a change and end the stigma around sex work.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| last1= Lutnick| first1=Alexandra| last2= Cohen| first2=Deborah| date=2009| title= Criminalization, legalization or decriminalization of sex work: what female sex workers say in San Francisco, USA| url= http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0968808009344699| journal= Reproductive Health Matters| volume= 17| issue= 34| pages= 38–46| accessdate= March 13, 2015| doi=10.1016/s0968-8080(09)34469-9| pmid=19962636}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The red umbrella==
The red umbrella symbol was introduced by sex workers in Venice, Italy, in 2001, as part of the 49th Venice Biennale of Art. Sex workers also held a street demonstration, the Red Umbrellas March, in Venice to protest inhumane work conditions and human rights abuses.&lt;ref name="Red"&gt;{{cite web|title=Under the Red Umbrella|url=http://www.sexworkeurope.org/campaigns/red-umbrella-campaigns|work=Intl.

For [[International Women's Day]] (IWD) in March 2014, sex worker organizations and activists throughout the world used the red umbrella in activities of celebration and protest. For example, [[flash mob]] events in which the red umbrella was used were held in Sydney, Australia; London, UK; [[Bochum]], Germany; Thailand; the Netherlands; and [[Peru]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=GLOBAL FLASH MOB PERÚ.|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yqCKCloelbY|work=MIGUEL ANGEL SAURIN ROMERO on YouTube|publisher=Google Inc|accessdate=9 March 2014|author=MIGUEL ANGEL SAURIN ROMERO|format=Video upload|date=8 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Sex Worker's Rights on Women's Day Flash Mob protest in London|url=http://www.demotix.com/news/4129506/sex-workers-rights-womens-day-flash-mob-protest-london#media-4129047|work=Demotix|publisher=Corbis Corp|accessdate=9 March 2014|author=Guy Corbishley|date=8 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Bochum: Weltweiter Flashmob für Sexworker Rechte - Global Flash Mob for Sexworker|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVowDX5eN98&amp;feature=youtu.be|work=SexworkerRechte on YouTube|publisher=Google Inc|accessdate=9 March 2014|author=SexworkerRechte|format=Video upload|date=8 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=วันสตรีสากล for youtube.mp4|url=https://docs.google.com/file/d/0B-q044tUksshcWRGeWhtdFd4RVU/edit?pli=1|work=Google Docs|accessdate=9 March 2014|format=Video upload|date=10 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Swex PertiseGlobal Flash Mob for Sex Worker's Rights on Women's Day|url=https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=274618426036838&amp;set=gm.255031884675448&amp;type=1|work=Swex Pertise on Facebook|publisher=Facebook|accessdate=10 March 2014|author=Swex Pertise|format=Photo upload|date=9 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Red Umbrella Project]] is a [[non-profit organization]] based in [[New York City]] which advocates on behalf of [[sex worker]]s and strives to empower them by giving them a voice.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Red Umbrella Project|url=http://www.nswp.org/members/red-umbrella-project|website=Global Network of Sex Work Projects|accessdate=27 October 2017|date=2010-11-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Regional organizations==
{{main|List of sex worker organizations}}
Although research about the sex worker movement has been conducted mainly in North American and Western European countries, sex worker-led mobilization has occurred around the world. Such actions seek to influence policies so that sex work is recognized as a legitimate profession, and sufficient rights are provided to sex workers.

===Australia===
[[Scarlet Alliance]] is the peak body for sex worker organizations in [[Australia]] and campaigns for the full decriminalization of sex work, in addition to providing HIV/AIDS [[outreach]] and education to sex workers.&lt;ref name=victoria&gt;{{cite journal|last=Jeffreys|first=Elana|author2=Audrey Autonomy |author3=Jane Green |author4=Christina Vega |title=Listen to Sex Workers: Support Decriminalization and Anti-discrimination Policies|journal=Interface: A Journal for and About Social Movements|date=November 2011|volume=3|issue=2|pages=271–287|url=http://www.interfacejournal.net/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/Interface-3-2-Scarlet-Alliance.pdf|accessdate=18 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The country has been credited with better sex worker [[occupational health and safety]], high [[condom]] use, and the lowest [[sexually transmitted infection|STI]] and [[HIV]] rates around the world. Furthermore, the now-defunct Prostitutes Collective of Victoria (PCV), founded in [[Melbourne]], [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]], was the first sex workers’ organization in the world to receive government funding (the organization was renamed "Resourcing Health Education for the Sex Industry (RhED)" and became part of the Inner South Community Health Service, but, as of 2013, is a different kind of organization).{{citation needed|date=December 2013}}

===Africa===
SWEAT (Sex Worker Education and Advocacy Task) is an advocacy organization located in [[Cape Town]], [[South Africa]], with the goal of providing education and public health services to sex workers. They also lobby for the decriminalization of sex work, and have recently begun a research program in 2003, with the goal of influencing future policy pertaining to sex workers.&lt;ref name=africa&gt;{{cite journal|last=Arnott|first=Jayne|title=SWEAT (Sex Worker Education and Advocacy Taskforce)|journal=Feminist Africa Subaltern Sexualities|year=2006|issue=6|pages=88–90|url=http://agi.ac.za/sites/agi.ac.za/files/fa_6_profile_2.pdf|accessdate=18 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Asia===
The Asia Pacific Network of Sex Workers (APNSW) was formed in 1994 to advance the rights of sex workers in [[Asia]], and to provide direct support to Asian sex workers, particularly in relation to human rights issues and [[HIV]] support services.&lt;ref name=apnsw&gt;{{cite web|title=American Jewish World Service|url=http://ajws.org/where_we_work/asia/thailand/asia_pacific_network_of_sex__workers_apnsw.html|work=Asia Pacific Network of Sex Workers (APNSW)|accessdate=18 March 2013|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100613161154/http://ajws.org/where_we_work/asia/thailand/asia_pacific_network_of_sex__workers_apnsw.html|archivedate=13 June 2010|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Australian-born sex worker activist Andrew Hunter was instrumental in the development of APNSW, as well as a contributor to the growth of the Global Network of Sex Work Projects (NSWP), and his significant history of activism is internationally recognized.&lt;ref name="Hunter"&gt;{{cite web|title=Memorial to Andrew Hunter|url=http://www.nswp.org/page/memorial-andrew-hunter|work=NSWP|publisher=NSWP|accessdate=9 March 2014|date=January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Europe===
[[TAMPEP]] is organization that was founded in 1993. Its aims are to help [[migrant sex work]]ers in more than twenty-five European nations especially focusing on the [[public health]] needs of those workers in Central and Eastern [[Europe]]. It also examines the legislative framework that sex work takes place within in order to suggest better policies that would protect sex workers. Some of the outreach methods used to assist sex workers include outreach and education and cultural and peer mediators. Some of the results of research carried out include identification of migrant sex workers and barriers to protection of their rights and the creation of networks between sex workers, organizations, and medical care.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|journal=TAMPEP General Presentation|pages=1–18|url=http://tampep.eu/documents/tampep_generalpresentation.pdf|accessdate=1 April 2013|title=TAMPEP pdf file|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120723175325/http://tampep.eu/documents/tampep_generalpresentation.pdf|archivedate=23 July 2012|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=TAMPEP&gt;{{cite journal|title=Sex Work Migration Health|journal=TAMPEP|year=2009|url=http://tampep.eu/documents/Sexworkmigrationhealth_final.pdf|accessdate=18 March 2013|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131116062644/http://tampep.eu/documents/Sexworkmigrationhealth_final.pdf|archivedate=16 November 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===North America===
The [[Sex Professionals of Canada]] (SPOC) is a national, voluntary, sex worker-run organization that is funded entirely by donations. Founded in 1983, the organization seeks to decriminalize all forms of sex work in Canada through advocacy and education.&lt;ref name="Home"&gt;{{cite web|title=Home|url=http://www.spoc.ca/index.html|work=SPOC|publisher=SPOC|accessdate=9 March 2014|year=2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Sex Professionals of Canada (SPOC)|url=http://canadianharmreduction.com/node/663|work=Canadian Harm Reduction Network|publisher=Canadian Harm Reduction Network|accessdate=9 March 2014|year=2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===South America===
The Network of Sex Workers in [[Latin America]] and the [[Caribbean]] (RedTraSex) was organized in 1997 in fifteen countries to fight for the rights of sex workers. So far, the organization has influenced policy in certain countries and has interacted with the president [[Rafael Correa]] of [[Ecuador]] and Luis Ignacio Lula de Silva in [[Brazil]]. One achievement made in Latin America has been the sex worker identification card that has been issued in [[Bolivia]]. Furthermore, more sex workers have been included in HIV and health services education.&lt;ref name=latinamerica&gt;{{cite journal|journal=Network of Sex Workers Women from Latin America and the Caribbean|url=http://www.redtrasex.org/IMG/pdf/Eng-RedTraSex-web.pdf |accessdate=18 March 2013|title=pdf file}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=redtrasex&gt;{{cite web|title=RedTraSex|url=http://www.aidsalliance.org/linkingorganisationdetails.aspx?id=5011|accessdate=18 March 2013|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130404235710/http://www.aidsalliance.org/linkingorganisationdetails.aspx?id=5011|archivedate=4 April 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==International organizations==

===Global Network of Sex Work Projects (NSWP)===
{{Main|Global Network of Sex Work Projects}}
Global Network of Sex Work Projects (NSWP) is an [[organization]] that was founded in 1990 by sex workers from different nations at the 2nd International Conference for NGOs working on AIDS in Paris, France. The organization has received financial support from bodies such as the Open Society Foundations,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=PUBLIC HEALTH PROGRAM: Network of Sex Work Projects|url=http://www.opensocietyfoundations.org/about/programs/public-health-program/grantees/network-sex-work-projects-0|work=Open Society Foundations|publisher=Open Society Foundations|accessdate=5 March 2014|year=2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; and states that it "conducts a mix of pro-active and re-active policy advocacy to support human rights and evidence based approaches to female, male, and transgendered sex workers and strengthening sex worker communities", while "organising at and international (including regional) level brings local and national level experiences to bear in international debates".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Official Founding of NSWP|url=http://www.nswp.org/timeline/event/official-founding-nswp|work=NSWP|publisher=NSWP|accessdate=5 March 2014|year=2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Our work|url=http://www.nswp.org/page/our-work|work=NSWP|publisher=NSWP|accessdate=5 March 2014|year=2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Global Network of Sex Work Projects]] (NSWP) is largely responsible for the language shift—most notably, the use of the term "sex worker" instead of "prostitute"—that corresponds with a genuine recognition of sex workers' human rights. The organization's advocacy work has included HIV/AIDS, addressing sex worker [[discrimination]],&lt;ref name=nswp&gt;{{cite web|title=NSWP|url=http://www.akvo.org/rsr/organisation/702/|accessdate=18 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; and participating in research about the profession. NSWP created the publication, ''Research for Sex Work'', for activists, health workers, and NGOs.&lt;ref name=researchnswp&gt;{{cite web|work=NSWP|url=http://www.nswp.org/research-sex-work|title=Research for Sex Work|publisher=[[Global Network of Sex Work Projects]]|accessdate=18 March 2013|date=2010-10-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the 2012 International AIDS Conference, held in [[Kolkata]], India, sex worker activists from different countries formed the Sex Worker Freedom Festival (SWFF) as an alternative event for sex workers and allies. The week-long festival included activity in the Sonagachi red-light area&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Sex Worker Freedom Festival|url=http://in.reuters.com/article/2012/07/27/sex-worker-freedom-festival-idINRTR35BWS|accessdate=8 April 2014|newspaper=Reuters (India edition)|date=27 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; and represented a protest against the exclusion of sex workers. The event also sought to ensure that the perspectives of sex workers were heard in meetings held in Washington D.C., US. A report, entitled "Solidarity Is Not A Crime", was published by NSWP in April 2014 and is described by the organization as "a snapshot of curated content outlining a significant and historical moment in the Sex Worker Rights Movement".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=NSWP Published the Sex Worker Freedom Festival Report|url=http://www.nswp.org/news-story/nswp-publishes-the-sex-worker-freedom-festival-report|publisher=[[Global Network of Sex Work Projects]]|accessdate=8 April 2014|date=7 April 2014|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140408233832/http://www.nswp.org/news-story/nswp-publishes-the-sex-worker-freedom-festival-report|archivedate=8 April 2014|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===World Health Organization (WHO)===
The [[World Health Organization]] has released a report focusing on the violence that sex workers face and their vulnerability to HIV/AIDS. It included currently used intervention strategies as well as [[policy]] recommendations from the ''WHO Sex Work Toolkit''.&lt;ref name="World Health Organization"/&gt; Furthermore, another report addressing [[HIV]] prevention in middle to low-income countries was released with policy guidelines based off research conducted by the [[organization]] which recommended that sex work be decriminalized and called for the elimination of unjust application of non-criminal laws and regulations against sex workers.&lt;ref name=WHO&gt;{{cite book|title=Prevention and Treatment of HIV and other Sexually Transmitted Infections for Sex Workers in Low- and Middle-Income Countries: Recommendations for a Public Health Approach|date=December 2012|publisher=World Health Organization|location=Geneva, Switzerland}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===United Nations (UN)===
[[UNAIDS]] has written a report with policy suggestions in Asia and the Pacific that includes case studies to support ways to improve access to health services in [[Asia]] and the [[Pacific]]. It also addresses some of the factors that hinder sex workers from accessing health services. Furthermore, the [[UN]] released a development report titled ''Sex Work and the Law in Asia and the Pacific'' discussing the policies surrounding sex work in Asian and Pacific countries, the effects these laws have on sex workers, and policy recommendations. Some of the policy recommendations for governments included decriminalizing sex work and activities associated with it, providing sex workers with work related protections, and supporting sex workers' access to health services.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|journal=Sex Work and the Law in Asia and the Pacific|year=2012|url=http://www.snap-undp.org/elibrary/Publications/HIV-2012-SexWorkAndLaw.pdf|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121112080513/http://www.snap-undp.org/elibrary/Publications/HIV-2012-SexWorkAndLaw.pdf|dead-url=yes|archive-date=2012-11-12|title=sex work pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

They have also released a 2011-2015 strategy report titled ''Getting to Zero'' that aims for the vision of "Zero new HIV infections. Zero discrimination. Zero AIDS-related deaths". The report states that its goals include reducing HIV transmission by half, getting universal access to anti-retroviral therapy for those living with HIV, and reducing the number of countries with punitive laws around HIV transmission, sex work, drug use, or homosexual activity by half all by 2015.&lt;ref name=Zero&gt;{{cite report|title=Getting to Zero|url=http://www.unaids.org/sites/default/files/sub_landing/files/JC2034_UNAIDS_Strategy_en.pdf |date=December 2010|publisher=UNAIDS|ISBN=9789291738830|accessdate=2 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===International Labor Organization (ILO)===
Similarly, the [[ILO]] has released reports suggesting policies that could be put into place that would address the vulnerabilities that sex workers encounter due to the nature of their jobs. Most of the reports deal with ways to decrease the number of workers that contract HIV/AIDS so that the disease is not spread to the general population. It also supports the "Getting to Zero" mission, and has found different ways to implement the primary policy initiative,''Recommendation 200''. This recommendation states that "Measures be taken in and through the workplace to facilitate access to HIV prevention, treatment, care, and support services for workers, their families, and dependents". The publication discusses some of the different ways that they have implemented programs that target both sex workers and their clients in different countries worldwide.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=International Labor Organization|title=Reaching Out to Sex Workers and their Clients}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another report released by the [[ILO]] examines sex work in [[Cambodia]] by evaluating direct and indirect sex work in various settings and case studies with sex workers in order to conclude with policy suggestions that can be used to decrease the rate of HIV/AIDS transmission among sex workers, their clients, and to the general population also. Some of the key recommendations from this report suggest addressing violence and abuse that is work-related, expanding unions to include indirect sex workers, bringing a workplace perspective to prevention care and health strategies, and coordinating health and safety interventions within the workplace. Under each category more specific initiatives that can be implemented were also included.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=International Labor Organization|title=Cambodia-Addressing HIV Vulnerabilities of Indirect Sex Workers during the Financial Crisis|journal=ILO Publications|year=2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Dates of significance==

===March 3: International Sex Workers' Rights Day===
This day began when over 25,000 sex workers gathered in India for a festival organized by a Calcutta-based group called [[Durbar Mahila Samanwaya Committee]] (Unstoppable Women's Synthesis Committee), despite protests pressuring the government to revoke the permit for the parade in 2001.&lt;ref name=celebratory/&gt;

===June 2: International Sex Workers' Day===
{{main|International Whores' Day|l1=International Sex Workers' Day}}
This day began June 2, 1975, in [[Lyon]], [[France]], when a group of sex workers met in a church to express their anger about exploitative living conditions and the criminalization they face because of their work.&lt;ref name=celebratory/&gt;

===August 3: China Sex Worker Day===
In 2009, the Chinese Grassroots Women's Rights Center designated this day to fight the discrimination that faces Chinese sex workers.&lt;ref name=celebratory/&gt;

===December 17: International Day to End Violence against Sex Workers===
In 2003, Dr. Anne Sprinkle founded the [[Sex Workers Outreach Project USA]] and held a vigil on this day for the victims of the [[Green River Killer]], and this day has been commemorated ever since to remember the victims of violent crimes and fight discrimination of crimes related to sex work.&lt;ref name=celebratory&gt;{{cite web|title=Global Network of Sex Workers Project|url=http://www.nswp.org/event/international-sex-worker-rights-day-3|work=Upcoming Events|accessdate=18 March 2013|publisher=[[Global Network of Sex Work Projects]]|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130317002856/http://www.nswp.org/event/international-sex-worker-rights-day-3|archivedate=17 March 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Sheldon Mervin Chumir''' (December 3, 1940 – January 26, 1992) was a lawyer and politician from [[Alberta]], [[Canada]].

Sheldon Chumir was born in [[Calgary]]. He studied law at the [[University of Alberta]], from which he graduated in 1963 with the gold medal.&lt;ref&gt;Cotler, Irwin. ''The New Human Rights Agenda:The First Sheldon Chumir Lecture''. Centre for Constitutional Studies/Centre d'etudes Constitutionnelles, 'Constitutional Forum Constitutionel' Vol.6 Number 2, Winter 1995, p. 43. http://ualawccsprod.srv.ualberta.ca/ccs/images/journals/forum/1-ConstitutionalForum6_2.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; He continued his education as a [[Rhodes Scholar]] and earned a [[Bachelor of Letters]] degree from [[Oxford University]] in 1965.

==Law, business career and political activism==

Chumir began his professional career as a tax lawyer with the federal Department of Justice in Toronto.  In 1971, he joined a Calgary law firm. In 1976, he launched his own private practice focusing on civil liberties cases which on occasion provided representation on a [[pro-bono]] basis.&lt;ref&gt;^ Cotler, Irwin. The New Human Rights Agenda:The First Sheldon Chumir Lecture. Centre for Constitutional Studies/Centre d'etudes Constitutionnelles, 'Constitutional Forum Constitutionel' Vol.6 Number 2, Winter 1995, p. 43. http://ualawccsprod.srv.ualberta.ca/ccs/images/journals/forum/1-ConstitutionalForum6_2.pdf, p.7&lt;/ref&gt; He lectured on civil liberties and human rights at the [[University of Calgary]] Law School and founded the Calgary Civil Liberties Association.  He was also an entrepreneur; he founded a small oil and gas company, co-founded the entertainment promotion firm Brimstone Productions and engaged in real estate.

In 1983, he ventured into activism by creating Save Public Education, an organization which opposed public funding of religious schools.&lt;ref name="fonds"&gt;[http://ww2.glenbow.org/search/archivesMainResults.aspx?XC=/search/archivesMainResults.aspx&amp;TN=MAINCAT&amp;AC=QBE_QUERY&amp;RF=WebResults&amp;DL=0&amp;RL=0&amp;NP=255&amp;MF=WPEngMsg.ini&amp;MR=5&amp;QB0=AND&amp;QF0=Main%20entry%2B%7C%2BTitle&amp;QI0=Sheldon%20Chumir%20fonds Sheldon Chumir fonds], The Glenbow Museum. Retrieved August 29, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; The group ran a successful slate of candidates in a Calgary Board of Education election. 

== Political career ==
In the [[Alberta general election, 1986|1986 Alberta general election]], he ran as a [[Alberta Liberal Party|Liberal]] in the riding of [[Calgary Buffalo]] and defeated incumbent [[Brian Lee (politician)|Brian Lee]] of the [[Progressive Conservative Association of Alberta|Progressive Conservative Party]]. He was among the first four Liberals elected to the [[Legislative Assembly of Alberta]] since 1969. In the Assembly, he advocated on legal affairs, human rights, energy, finance and community service, and he advocated legislation that supported human rights and civil liberties.&lt;ref name="fonds"/&gt;  He was re-elected in [[Alberta general election, 1989|1989]].

== Death and legacy ==
Chumir died in 1992.  Having no close kin, he had set up his estate to establish the Sheldon Chumir Foundation for Ethics Leadership.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.archivescanada.ca/english/search/ItemDisplay.asp?sessionKey=999999999_142&amp;l=0&amp;lvl=1&amp;v=0&amp;coll=0&amp;itm=255659&amp;rt=1&amp;bill=1 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-08-20 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150924041751/http://www.archivescanada.ca/english/search/ItemDisplay.asp?sessionKey=999999999_142&amp;l=0&amp;lvl=1&amp;v=0&amp;coll=0&amp;itm=255659&amp;rt=1&amp;bill=1 |archivedate=2015-09-24 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; As a politician and human rights lawyer Chumir was an advocate for human rights and believed ethical values are fundamental to a healthy society. The foundation was intended to advocate for leadership and legislature to further the advancement of democratic legislation and social reform.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cbern.ca/cms/One.aspx?objectId=8318239&amp;contextId=625751&amp;BrowseFilterRequest=14&amp;CrmObjectTypeId=6212263&amp;crm_object_type=Organization&amp;AttributeId=38548&amp;CrmObjectId=17721156&amp;crm_object_id=17721156 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-08-20 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20130820094744/http://www.cbern.ca/cms/One.aspx?objectId=8318239&amp;contextId=625751&amp;BrowseFilterRequest=14&amp;CrmObjectTypeId=6212263&amp;crm_object_type=Organization&amp;AttributeId=38548&amp;CrmObjectId=17721156&amp;crm_object_id=17721156 |archivedate=2013-08-20 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The foundation offers internships and scholarships for students studying the field of Leadership and Law, publishes material pertaining to civil rights, and supports initiatives in the community.

The [[Sheldon M. Chumir Centre]], an eight-story medical facility named in honor of Chumir, opened in Calgary in April 2008. The facility includes an Urgent Care Centre, Mental Health clinic, Diagnostic Imaging department and the [[Southern Alberta HIV Clinic]].

Chumir was called one of Alberta's New Mavericks by Jamie Komarnicki of the ''[[Calgary Herald]]'', who in Chumir's obituary described him as a "soft-spoken man with a quirky sense of humour [who] was a determined champion of public education and individual freedoms."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www2.canada.com/calgaryherald/news/story.html?id=1dcedb61-74d3-4df2-b1b9-72d89f407d27 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-08-20 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130820064409/http://www2.canada.com/calgaryherald/news/story.html?id=1dcedb61-74d3-4df2-b1b9-72d89f407d27 |archivedate=2013-08-20 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.calgaryherald.com/entertainment/long+list+Mavericks/3655259/story.html&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2012, Chumir was posthumously honored by the Calgary Stampede Foundation with the centennial edition of the Western Legacy Award. This unique edition award recognized contributions of 100 Calgarians and their services to Calgary.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.ucalgary.ca/news/utoday/january16-2013/westernlegacy&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7667">A system of '''skew coordinates''' is a [[curvilinear coordinates|curvilinear]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://mathworld.wolfram.com/SkewCoordinateSystem.html]&lt;/ref&gt; [[coordinate system]] where the [[Coordinate_system#Coordinate_surface|coordinate surfaces]] are not [[orthogonal]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://mathworld.wolfram.com/SkewCoordinateSystem.html Skew Coordinate System] at [[Mathworld]]&lt;/ref&gt; in contrast to [[orthogonal coordinates]].

Skew coordinates tend to be more complicated to work with compared to orthogonal coordinates since the [[metric tensor]] will have nonzero off-diagonal components, preventing many simplifications in formulas for [[tensor algebra]] and [[tensor calculus]]. The nonzero off-diagonal components of the metric tensor are a direct result of the non-orthogonality of the basis vectors of the coordinates, since by definition:&lt;ref name=p13&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;g_{i j} = \mathbf e_i \cdot \mathbf e_j&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;g_{i j}&lt;/math&gt; is the metric tensor and &lt;math&gt;\mathbf e_i&lt;/math&gt; the (covariant) [[basis vector]]s.

These coordinate systems can be useful if the geometry of a problem fits well into a skewed system. For example, solving [[Laplace's equation]] in a [[parallelogram]] will be easiest when done in appropriately skewed coordinates.

==Cartesian coordinates with one skewed axis==

[[Image:SkewCartesianSystem.svg|thumb|right|A coordinate system where the ''x'' axis has been bent toward the ''z'' axis.]]

The simplest 3D case of a skew coordinate system is a [[Cartesian coordinates|Cartesian]] one where one of the axes (say the ''x'' axis) has been bent by some angle &lt;math&gt;\phi&lt;/math&gt;, staying orthogonal to one of the remaining two axes. For this example, the ''x'' axis of a Cartesian coordinate has been bent toward the ''z'' axis by &lt;math&gt;\phi&lt;/math&gt;, remaining orthogonal to the ''y'' axis.

===Algebra and useful quantities===

Let &lt;math&gt;\mathbf e_1&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\mathbf e_2&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;\mathbf e_3&lt;/math&gt; respectively be unit vectors along the &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;z&lt;/math&gt; axes. These represent the [[Covariance and contravariance of vectors|covariant]] basis; computing their dot products gives the following components of the [[metric tensor]]:

:&lt;math&gt;g_{11} = g_{22} = g_{33} = 1 \quad ; \quad g_{12} = g_{23} = 0 \quad ; \quad g_{13} = \cos\left(\frac \pi 2 - \phi\right) = \sin(\phi)&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\sqrt{g} = \mathbf e_1 \cdot (\mathbf e_2 \times \mathbf e_3) = \cos(\phi)&lt;/math&gt;

which are quantities that will be useful later on.

The contravariant basis is given by&lt;ref name=p13/&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf e^1 = \frac{\mathbf e_2 \times \mathbf e_3}{\sqrt{g}} = \frac{\mathbf e_2 \times \mathbf e_3}{\cos(\phi)}&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf e^2 = \frac{\mathbf e_3 \times \mathbf e_1}{\sqrt{g}} = \mathbf e_2&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf e^3 = \frac{\mathbf e_1 \times \mathbf e_2}{\sqrt{g}} = \frac{\mathbf e_1 \times \mathbf e_2}{\cos(\phi)}&lt;/math&gt;

The contravariant basis isn't a very convenient one to use, however it shows up in definitions so must be considered. We'll favor writing quantities with respect to the covariant basis.

Since the basis vectors are all constant, vector addition and subtraction will simply be familiar component-wise adding and subtraction. Now, let

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf a = \sum_i a^i \mathbf e_i \quad \mbox{and} \quad \mathbf b = \sum_i b^i \mathbf e_i&lt;/math&gt;

where the sums indicate summation over all values of the index (in this case, ''i'' = 1, 2, 3). The [[Covariance and contravariance of vectors|contravariant and covariant]] components of these vectors may be related by

:&lt;math&gt;a^i = \sum_j a_j g^{ij}&lt;/math&gt;

so that, explicitly,

:&lt;math&gt;a^1 = \frac{a_1 - \sin(\phi) a_3}{\cos^2(\phi)},&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;a^2 = a_2,&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;a^3 = \frac{-\sin(\phi) a_1 + a_3}{\cos^2(\phi)}.&lt;/math&gt;

The [[dot product]] in terms of contravariant components is then

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf a \cdot \mathbf b = \sum_i a^i b_i = a^1 b^1 + a^2 b^2 + a^3 b^3 + \sin(\phi) (a^1 b^3 + a^3 b^1)&lt;/math&gt;

and in terms of covariant components

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf a \cdot \mathbf b = \cos^2(\phi) [ a_1 b_1 + a_2 b_2 + a_3 b_3 - \sin(\phi) (a_1 b_3 + a_3 b_1) ].&lt;/math&gt;

===Calculus===

By definition,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

&lt;/ref&gt; the [[gradient]] of a scalar function ''f'' is

:&lt;math&gt;\nabla f = \sum_i \mathbf e^i \frac{\partial f}{\partial q^i} = \frac{\partial f}{\partial x} \mathbf e^1 + \frac{\partial f}{\partial y} \mathbf e^2 + \frac{\partial f}{\partial z} \mathbf e^3&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;q_i&lt;/math&gt; are the coordinates ''x'', ''y'', ''z'' indexed. Recognizing this as a vector written in terms of the contravariant basis, it may be rewritten:

:&lt;math&gt;\nabla f = 
\frac{\frac{\partial f}{\partial x} - \sin(\phi) \frac{\partial f}{\partial z}}{\cos(\phi)^2} \mathbf e_1 + 
\frac{\partial f}{\partial y} \mathbf e_2 + 
\frac{-\sin(\phi) \frac{\partial f}{\partial x} + \frac{\partial f}{\partial z}}{\cos(\phi)^2} \mathbf e_3.&lt;/math&gt;

The [[divergence]] of a vector &lt;math&gt;\mathbf a&lt;/math&gt; is

:&lt;math&gt;\nabla \cdot \mathbf a = \frac{1}{\sqrt{g}} \sum_i \frac{\partial}{\partial q^i}\left(\sqrt{g} a^i\right) = \frac{\partial a^1}{\partial x} + \frac{\partial a^2}{\partial y} + \frac{\partial a^3}{\partial z}.&lt;/math&gt;

and of a tensor &lt;math&gt;\mathbf A&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\nabla \cdot \mathbf A = \frac{1}{\sqrt{g}} \sum_{i, j} \frac{\partial}{\partial q^i}\left(\sqrt{g} a^{ij} \mathbf e_j\right) = 
\sum_{i, j} \mathbf e_j \frac{\partial a^{ij}}{\partial q^i}.&lt;/math&gt;

The [[Laplacian]] of ''f'' is

:&lt;math&gt;\nabla^2 f = \nabla \cdot \nabla f = 
\frac{1}{\cos(\phi)^2}\left(\frac{\partial^2 f}{\partial x^2} + \frac{\partial^2 f}{\partial z^2} - 2 \sin(\phi) \frac{\partial^2 f}{\partial x \partial z}\right) + \frac{\partial^2 f}{\partial y^2}&lt;/math&gt;

and, since the covariant basis is normal and constant, the [[vector Laplacian]] is the same as the componentwise Laplacian of a vector written in terms of the covariant basis.

While both the dot product and gradient are somewhat messy in that they have extra terms (compared to a Cartesian system) the [[advection|advection operator]] which combines a dot product with a gradient turns out very simple:

:&lt;math&gt;(\mathbf a \cdot \nabla) = \left(\sum_i a^i e_i\right) \cdot \left(\sum_i \frac{\partial}{\partial q^i} \mathbf e^i\right) = \left(\sum_i a^i \frac{\partial}{\partial q^i}\right)
&lt;/math&gt;

which may be applied to both scalar functions and vector functions, componentwise when expressed in the covariant basis.

Finally, the [[curl (mathematics)|curl]] of a vector is

:&lt;math&gt;\nabla \times \mathbf a = \sum_{i, j, k} \mathbf e_k \epsilon^{ijk} \frac{\partial a_i}{\partial q^i} = &lt;/math&gt;
::&lt;math&gt;\frac{1}{\cos(\phi)}\left(
\left(\sin(\phi) \frac{\partial a^1}{\partial y} + \frac{\partial a^3}{\partial y} - \frac{\partial a^2}{\partial z}\right) \mathbf e_1 + 
\left(\frac{\partial a^1}{\partial z} + \sin(\phi) \left(\frac{\partial a^3}{\partial z} - \frac{\partial a^1}{\partial x}\right) - \frac{\partial a^3}{\partial x}\right) \mathbf e_2 + 
\left(\frac{\partial a^2}{\partial x} - \frac{\partial a^1}{\partial y} - \sin(\phi) \frac{\partial a^3}{\partial y}\right) \mathbf e_3
\right).&lt;/math&gt;

'''Soku-hi''' ({{lang-ja|即非}}) means "is and is not". The term is primarily used by the representatives of the [[Kyoto School]] of [[Eastern philosophy]].

The logic of soku-hi or "is and is not" represents a balanced logic of symbolization reflecting sensitivity to the mutual determination of universality and particularity in nature, and a corresponding emphasis on nonattachment to [[Predicate (grammar)|linguistic predicates]] and subjects as representations of the real.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ccbs.ntu.edu.tw/FULLTEXT/JR-PHIL/axtell1.htm G.

A '''specification language''' is a [[formal language]] in [[computer science]] used during [[systems analysis]], [[requirements analysis]] and [[systems design]] to describe a system at a much higher level than a [[programming language]], which is used to produce the executable code for a system.

Specification languages are generally not directly executed. They are meant to describe the ''what'', not the ''how''. Indeed, it is considered as an error if a requirement specification is cluttered with unnecessary implementation detail.

A common fundamental assumption of many specification approaches is that programs are modelled as [[algebra]]ic or [[model theory|model-theoretic]] structures that include a collection of [[set (mathematics)|sets]] of data values together with [[function (mathematics)|functions]] over those sets.  This level of abstraction coincides with the view that the correctness of the input/output behaviour of a program takes precedence over all its other properties.

In the ''property-oriented'' approach to specification (taken e.g. by [[Common Algebraic Specification Language|CASL]]), specifications of programs consist mainly of logical [[axiom]]s, usually in a [[logical system]] in which equality has a prominent role, describing the properties that the functions are required to satisfy - often just by their interrelationship.
This is in contrast to so-called [[model-based specification|model-oriented specification]] in frameworks like [[Vienna Development Method|VDM]] and [[Z notation|Z]], which consist of a simple realization of the required behaviour.

Specifications must be subject to a process of ''refinement'' (the filling-in of implementation detail) before they can actually be implemented. The result of such a refinement process is an executable algorithm, which is either formulated in a programming language, or in an executable subset of the specification language at hand. For example, [[Hartmann pipeline]]s, when
properly applied, may be considered a [[dataflow]] specification which ''is'' directly executable.  Another example is the [[Actor model]] which has no specific application content and must be ''specialized'' to be executable.

An important use of specification languages is enabling the creation of [[Mathematical proof|proof]]s of [[program correctness]] (''see [[Automated theorem prover|theorem prover]]'').

'''Thatching''' is the craft of building a [[roof]] with dry vegetation such as [[straw]], [[Phragmites|water reed]], [[Cyperaceae|sedge]] (''[[Cladium mariscus]]''), [[Juncus|rushes]], [[Calluna|heather]], or [[palm branch]]es, layering the vegetation so as to shed water away from the inner roof. Since the bulk of the vegetation stays dry and is densely packed—trapping air—thatching also functions as insulation. It is a very old roofing method and has been used in both [[tropical]] and [[temperate climates]]. Thatch is still employed by builders in developing countries, usually with low-cost local vegetation. By contrast, in some developed countries it is  the choice of some affluent people who desire a rustic look for their home, would like a more ecologically friendly roof, or who have purchased an originally thatched abode.

==History==
Thatching methods have traditionally been passed down from generation to generation, and numerous descriptions of the materials and methods used in [[Europe]] over the past three centuries survive in archives and early publications.
[[File:Thatch C8248 Stretton on Fosse.jpg|thumb|Thatched roof, England]]
In some equatorial countries, thatch is the prevalent local material for [[roof]]s, and often [[wall]]s. There are diverse building techniques from the [[ancient Hawaiian]] ''hale'' shelter made from the local [[Cordyline fruticosa|ti leaves]] (''Cordyline fruticosa''), [[lauhala]] (''Pandanus tectorius'') &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | first1 = Lex AJ | last1 = Thomson | first2 = Lois | last2 = Englberger | first3 = Luigi | last3 = Guarino | first4 = RR | last4 = Thaman | first5 = Craig R | last5 = Elevitch | year = 2006 | chapter = Pandanus tectorius (''Pandanus'') | edition = 1.1 | editor-first = Craig R | editor-last = Elevitch | title = Species Profiles for Pacific Island Agroforestry | publisher = Permanent Agriculture Resources (PAR) | location = Hōlualoa, [[Hawai‘i|HI]] | format = [[PDF]] | url = http://www.agroforestry.net/tti/P.tectorius-pandanus.pdf | deadurl = no | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20121021015441/http://www.agroforestry.net/tti/P.tectorius-pandanus.pdf | archivedate = 2012-10-21 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; or [[Heteropogon contortus|pili grass]] (''Heteropogon contortus'').

Palm leaves are also often used. For example, in Na Bure, [[Fiji]], thatchers combine fan palm leave roofs with layered reed walls. Feathered palm leaf roofs are used in Dominica.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://hawaiianthatch.com/index-3.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-02-01 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20140201101759/http://hawaiianthatch.com/index-3.html |archivedate=2014-02-01 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Imperata cylindrica|Alang-alang]] (''Imperata cylindrica'') thatched roofs are used in Hawaii and [[Bali]]. In Southeast Asia, mangrove [[Nypa fruticans|nipa palm]] leaves are used as thatched roof material known as [[attap dwelling]]. In Bali, [[Indonesia]], the black fibres of [[Arenga pinnata]] called ''ijuk'' is also used as thatched roof materials, usually used in [[Balinese temple]] roof and meru towers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title = The Indonesian Town Revisited, Volume 1 of Southeast Asian dynamics | author = Peter J.

Wild vegetation such as water reed (''Phragmites australis''), bulrush/cat tail (''Typha'' spp.), broom (''Cytisus scoparius''), heather (''Calluna vulgaris''), and rushes (''Juncus'' spp. and ''Schoenoplectus lacustris'') was probably used to cover shelters and primitive dwellings in Europe in the late Palaeolithic period, but so far no direct archaeological evidence for this has been recovered. People probably began to use straw in the Neolithic period when they first grew cereals—but once again, no direct archaeological evidence of straw for thatching in Europe prior to the early medieval period survives.{{Sfn | Letts | 2000}}{{Rp | needed = yes | date =February 2013}}

Many [[Indigenous people of the Americas|indigenous]] people of the Americas, such as the former Maya civilization, Mesoamerica, the Inca empire, and the Triple Alliance (Aztec), lived in thatched buildings. It is common to spot thatched buildings in rural areas of the Yucatán Peninsula as well as many settlements in other parts of Latin America, which closely resemble the method of construction from distant ancestors. After the collapse of most extant American societies due to diseases introduced by Europeans, wars, enslavement, and genocide, the first Americans encountered by Europeans lived in structures roofed with bark or skin set in panels that could be added or removed for ventilation, heating, and cooling.  Evidence of the many complex buildings with fiber-based roofing material was not rediscovered until the early 2000s. French and British settlers built temporary thatched dwellings with local vegetation as soon as they arrived in New France and New England, but covered more permanent houses with wooden shingles.

[[File:Thatched Roof Cottage, Cotswolds, England (2016).jpg|thumb|Thatched Roof Cottage, Cotswolds, England (2016)]]

In most of England, thatch remained the only roofing material available to the bulk of the population in the countryside, in many towns and villages, until the late 1800s.&lt;ref name= "MoirLetts"&gt;{{Citation | first1 = J | last1 = Moir | first2 = John | last2 = Letts | title = Thatch: Thatching in England 1790–1940 | publisher = English Heritage | journal = Research Transactions | volume = 5 | year = 1999}}.&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Slate industry in Wales|Commercial production of Welsh slate]] began in 1820, and the mobility provided by [[canals]] and then [[railways]] made other materials readily available. Still, the number of thatched properties actually increased in the UK during the mid-1800s as agriculture expanded, but then declined again at the end of the 19th century because of agricultural recession and rural depopulation.  
[[File:Thatch stanton c 8333.jpg|thumb|Cottage with thatched roof in Stanton, a village in the Cotswolds, England]]
Gradually, thatch became a mark of poverty, and the number of thatched properties gradually declined, as did the number of professional thatchers. Thatch has become much more popular in the UK over the past 30 years, and is now a symbol of wealth rather than poverty. There are approximately 1,000 full-time thatchers at work in the UK,&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last = Letts | first = John | edition = unpublished | title = Survey | year = 2008}}.&lt;/ref&gt; and thatching is becoming popular again because of the renewed interest in preserving historic buildings and using more sustainable building materials.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.msn.com/en-us/money/realestate/magical-thatched-homes-that-will-enchant-you/ss-BBIRVia#image=21|title=Magical thatched homes that will enchant you|author=|date=|website=www.msn.com|accessdate=6 May 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180402035458/http://www.msn.com/en-us/money/realestate/magical-thatched-homes-that-will-enchant-you/ss-BBIRVia#image=21|archivedate=2 April 2018|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although thatch is popular in Germany, The Netherlands, Denmark, parts of France, Sicily, Belgium and Ireland, there are more thatched roofs in the [[United Kingdom]] than in any other European country.{{Citation needed|reason=reliable source needed for the whole sentence|date=February 2014}} Good quality straw thatch can last for more than 50 years when applied by a skilled thatcher. Traditionally, a new layer of straw was simply applied over the weathered surface, and this "spar coating" tradition has created accumulations of thatch over 7’ (2.1&amp;nbsp;m) thick on very old buildings. The straw is bundled into "yelms" before it is taken up to the roof and then is attached using staples, known as "spars", made from twisted hazel sticks. Over 250 roofs in Southern England have base coats of thatch that were applied over 500 years ago, providing direct evidence of the types of materials that were used for thatching in the medieval period.{{Sfn | Letts | 2000}}{{Rp | needed = yes | date =February 2013}}  Almost all of these roofs are thatched with wheat, rye, or a "maslin" mixture of both.  Medieval wheat grew to almost {{convert |6|ft}} tall in very poor soils and produced durable straw for the roof and grain for baking bread.

Technological change in the [[farming]] [[industry]] significantly affected the popularity of thatching. The availability of good quality thatching straw declined in England after the introduction of the combine harvester in the late 1930s and 1940s, and the release of short-stemmed wheat varieties. Increasing use of nitrogen fertiliser in the 1960s–70s also weakened straw and reduced its longevity. Since the 1980s, however, there has been a big increase in straw quality as specialist growers have returned to growing older, tall-stemmed, "heritage" varieties of wheat such as Squareheads Master (1880), N59 (1959), Rampton Rivet (1937), Victor (1910) and April Bearded (early 1800s)] in low input/organic conditions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last = Letts | first = John | year = 2007 | title = Growing Straw for Thatching: a guide | publisher = The COHT (Conservation of Historic Thatch Committee}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the UK it is illegal under the [[Plant Variety and Seeds Act 1964]] (with many amendments) for an individual or organisation to give, trade or sell seed of an older variety of wheat (or any other agricultural crop) to a third party for growing purposes, subject to a significant fine.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | title = Legislation | url = http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1964/14 | year = 1964 | deadurl = no | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20120111202021/http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1964/14 | archivedate = 2012-01-11 | df =  }}.&lt;/ref&gt;  Because of this legislation, thatchers in the UK can no longer obtain top quality thatching straw grown from traditional, tall-stemmed varieties of wheat.

All evidence indicates that water reed was rarely used for thatching outside of East Anglia.&lt;ref name= "MoirLetts"/&gt; It has traditionally been a "one coat" material applied in a similar way to how it is used in continental Europe. Weathered reed is usually stripped and replaced by a new layer. It takes 4–5 acres of well-managed reed bed to produce enough reed to thatch an average house, and large reed beds have been uncommon in most of England since the Anglo-Saxon period. Over 80% of the water reed used in the UK is now imported from [[Turkey]], [[Eastern Europe]], China and South Africa. Though water reed might last for 50 years or more on a steep roof in a dry climate, modern imported water reed on an average roof in England does not last any longer than good quality wheat straw. The lifespan of a thatched roof also depends on the skill of the thatcher, but other factors must be considered—such as [[climate]], quality of materials, and the roof pitch.

In areas where [[Arecaceae|palms]] are abundant, palm leaves are used to thatch walls and roofs. Many species of palm trees are called "[[thatch palm]]", or have "thatch" as part of their common names. In the [[southeastern United States]], Native and pioneer houses were often constructed of [[Arecaceae|palmetto]]-leaf thatch.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | editor1-last = Andrews | editor1-first = Charles Mclean | editor2-last = Andrews | editor2-first = Evangeline Walker | origyear = 1945 | title = Jonathan Dickinson's Journal or, God's Protecting Providence.

File:The Making of Thatch, Nigeria Photo 1.jpg|The creativity that comes with mud housing in rural areas is largely in the art of its roofing, of crafting thatch. As poor areas develop, newer ways of doing things have arrived: faster, more reliable, more durable ways. Houses are now being raised with modern materials, and even the ones standing still in traditional clay and thatch are being refurbished with the fashionable cement blocks/metal roofing sheets. This progression has no doubt brought about a decline in the practice of traditional crafts such as thatching.

File:The Making of Thatch, Nigeria Photo 2.jpg|Mr. Bassey Ekpenyong, an indigene of Ito community in Cross-River state, Nigeria, calls me his friend in that manner that, as a stranger serving in his community under the National Youth Service Corp, makes me feel safe. He invites me to his shop during evening hours, and as he offers me roasted nuts, he makes a new promise to take me on his bike to the beach when the rains have stopped and the roads are accessible again.

File:The Making of Thatch, Nigeria Photo 3.jpg|It is on my return to Ito after a couple of weeks away that I first see him seated in the shade outside of his shop, palm leaves littered all over. He sees the excitement register on my face as I pass on my bike and signals that I return, as if to say, "I have been waiting for you." And truly, he has.

File:The Making of Thatch, Nigeria Photo 4.jpg|He is making a new roof for his shop, he tells me. He wants me to make pictures. There are palm leaves all over, some tied up in a bunch, some lying underneath the sun, others thatched already and staked up in a pile. In his hands are two long, thinly carved sticks that would function as the skeletal frame for a pair of thatch.

File:The Making of Thatch, Nigeria Photo 5.jpg|He begins a new pair and laughs as he talks; a satisfaction comes with the knowledge that he is creating for me yet another experience to take home when service is over. He makes a joke of it.

File:The Making of Thatch, Nigeria Photo 6.jpg|He folds a leaf in half neatly across both sticks. He does the same for another leaf, lapping it with the previous; then, using another tiny stick which he breaks afterwards, pins the leaves firmly in place.

File:The Making of Thatch, Nigeria Photo 7.jpg|The process continues until the sticks are fully covered in green palm leaves. He completes a pair of thatch in minutes and begins another.

File:The Making of Thatch, Nigeria Photo 8.jpg|Mr. Bassey is a conversationalist. He talks about the need for this change, a practice he does every five years as this is the durability period for the thatch. "Nfok nkaya," he says in Efik, pointing to his shop behind: mud house with mat (thatch). He points to other houses around, including the ones made of clay but with metal roofing sheets, and calls them "Ikanga": zinc dey up.

File:The Making of Thatch, Nigeria Photo 9.jpg|On other days, Mr Bassey is joined by his friends. They sit for long hours underneath the tree on their return from their various farms. They chat as they thatch, switching on occasion from Efik to English.

File:The Making of Thatch, Nigeria Photo 10.jpg|They craft at the same pace, with the same measure of skill, but what intrigues me the most is their fellowship in that shared space, a communion of banter and silence. How silence descends on them as they craft, only to be broken yet again with a thought, a story, a sigh—childhood friends who had all grown up in this same space and carried within themselves different experiences as they each sorted life out; some leaving only to return yet again.

File:The Making of Thatch, Nigeria Photo 11.jpg|Childhood friends thatching through time, memories into their palms, pinning them into that place of recollection, of regret, of conquests. Pinning them with the same laughter and voices that survived time.

File:The Making of Thatch, Nigeria Photo 12.jpg|When asked how and when they had learnt thatching, the story is the same for everyone. They throw back to a time when they were just kids, when Ito was only made of the traditional mud houses.

File:The Making of Thatch, Nigeria Photo 13.jpg|As kids, they had been taken along with other kids by the contractor, an older member of the community who dealt in sales of thatch, to the beach. There, they had each been assigned to a bunch of palm leaves, and had made dozens of thatch. This contractor in return had provided their meal for the day and bought them treats. Afterwards, he had also paid their mothers for the children's work; money meant for their upkeep.

File:The Making of Thatch, Nigeria Photo 14.jpg|"We just sabi," Mr. Bassey tells me, explaining to me how he couldn't really pinpoint exactly how he had learnt. In a society where almost everything used was hand-crafted, most of these skills children grew into, got used to just by seeing them done on a daily basis, just by being a part of the home/society.

File:The Making of Thatch, Nigeria Photo 15.jpg|"Those wen no sabi wen we go beach go just sidon look those wen sabi, or, watch contractor do am and dem go sabi."

File:The Making of Thatch, Nigeria Photo 16.jpg|To Mr. Bassey this is more. It carries sentiments enough for him to brag about the metal roofing sheets he's kept lying waste in his house for years. When the few thatched houses left have been broken down and then raised up in modern fashion, he still sits outside of his shop underneath the tree every five years, matting green leaves into thatch.

File:The Making of Thatch, Nigeria Photo 17.jpg|His shop, once his home, carries for him memories of events: of childhood adventures; of leaving and returning; of his late wife, of loss. Memories that make him. And thatching, this craft, this practice of maintenance is, in a fast-paced world, for him the very means through which he holds time in his hands. The very means to which he laps these memories into a place of remembrance. The very means in which he shelters them.

==Maintenance in temperate climates==
[[File:Old-sanrizuka-goryou-farm,old-house-for-honored-guests,narita-city,japan.JPG|thumb|Thatched roof in [[Narita, Chiba|Narita]], [[Japan]].]]
Good thatch does not require frequent maintenance. In England a ridge normally lasts 8–14 years, and re-ridging is required several times during the lifespan of a thatch. Experts no longer recommend covering thatch with wire netting, as this slows evaporation and reduces longevity. [[Moss]] can be a problem if very thick, but is not usually detrimental, and many species of moss are actually protective. {{Citation | title = The Thatcher's Craft | year = 1960}}, remains the most widely used reference book on the techniques used for thatching.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | url = http://www.hct.ac.uk/Downloads/cp_thatch.html | publisher = HCT | place = [[United Kingdom|UK]] | title = Thatch | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20120111063005/http://www.hct.ac.uk/Downloads/cp_thatch.html | archivedate = 2012-01-11 | df =  }}.&lt;/ref&gt; The thickness of a layer of thatch decreases over time as the surface gradually turns to compost and is blown off the roof by wind and rain. Thatched roofs generally needs replacement when the horizontal wooden 'sways' and hair-pin 'spars', also known as 'gads' (twisted hazel staples) that fix each course become visible near the surface. It is not total depth of the thatch within a new layer applied to a new roof that determines its longevity, but rather how much weathering thatch covers the fixings of each overlapping course. “A roof is as good as the amount of correctly laid thatch covering the fixings.”&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | url = http://www.eamta.co.uk/ | title = The Thatch &amp; Thatching | publisher = The East Anglia Master Thatchers Association | place = UK | deadurl = no | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20110831101444/http://www.eamta.co.uk/ | archivedate = 2011-08-31 | df =  }}.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Flammability ==
{{unreferenced section|date=May 2014}}
[[Image:House river kwai.jpg|thumb|right|River houses on the [[Khwae Noi River|River Kwai]].]]
Thatch is not as flammable as many people believe. It burns slowly, "like a closed book," thatchers say. The vast majority of fires are linked to the use of wood burners and faulty chimneys with degraded or poorly installed or maintained flues. Sparks from paper or burned rubbish can ignite dry thatch on the surface around a chimney. Fires can also begin when sparks or flames work their way through a degraded chimney and ignite the surrounding semi-charred thatch. This can be avoided by ensuring that the chimney is in good condition, which may involve stripping thatch immediately surrounding the chimney to the full depth of the stack. This can easily be done without stripping thatch over the entire roof. Insurance premiums on thatched houses are higher than average in part because of the perception that thatched roofs are a fire hazard, but also because a thatch fire can cause extensive smoke damage and a thatched roof is more expensive to replace than a standard tiled or slate roof. Workmen should never use open flame near thatch, and nothing should be burnt that could fly up the chimney and ignite the surface of the thatch. [[Spark arrestor]]s usually cause more harm than good, as they are easily blocked and reduce air flow. All thatched roofs should have smoke detectors in the roof space. Spray-on fire retardant or pressure impregnated fire retardants can reduce the spread of flame and radiated heat output.

On new buildings, a solid fire retardant barrier over the rafters can make the thatch sacrificial in case of fire. If fireboards are used, they require a ventilation gap between boarding and thatch so that the roof can breathe, as condensation can be a significant problem in thin, single layer thatch. Condensation is much less of a problem on thick straw roofs, which also provide much better insulation since they do not need to be ventilated.

==Performance==
[[Image:Kodaiji-2002-0098.jpg|thumb|Ihōan, a tea house at [[Kōdai-ji]] in [[Kyoto]], [[Japan]].]]
The performance of thatch depends on roof shape and design, pitch of roof, position—its [[geography]] and [[topography]]—the quality of material and the expertise of the thatcher.

Thatch has some natural properties that are advantageous to its performance. It is naturally weather-resistant, and when properly maintained does not absorb a lot of water. There should not be a significant increase to roof weight due to water retention. A roof pitch of at least 50 degrees allows precipitation to travel quickly down slope so that it runs off the roof before it can penetrate the structure.

Thatch is also a natural insulator, and air pockets within straw thatch insulate a building in both warm and cold weather. A thatched roof ensures that a building is cool in summer and warm in winter.

Thatch also has very good resistance to wind damage when applied correctly.

===Advantages===
Thatching materials range from plains grasses to waterproof leaves found in equatorial regions. It is the most common roofing material in the world, because the materials are readily available.{{Citation needed|date=August 2017}}
[[Image:Partially thatched roof.jpg|thumb|right|Farm-house in the [[Netherlands]] near [[Alkmaar]]. The combination of thatch and [[roof tiles]] is quite common in that area.]]
Because thatch is lighter, less timber is required in the roof that supports it.

Thatch is a versatile material when it comes to covering irregular roof structures. This fact lends itself to the use of second-hand, [[recycled]] and natural materials that are not only more [[sustainable]], but need not fit exact standard dimensions to perform well.

===Disadvantages===
Thatched houses are harder to insure because of the perceived fire risk, and because thatching is labor-intensive, it is much more expensive to thatch a roof than to cover it with slate or tiles. Birds can damage a roof while they are foraging for grubs, and rodents are attracted by residual grain in straw.

Thatch has fallen out of favor in much of the industrialized world not because of fire, but because thatching has become very expensive and alternative 'hard' materials are cheaper—but this situation is slowly changing. There are about 60,000 thatched roofs in the UK, of which 50–80 suffer a serious fire each year, most of these being completely destroyed. The cost to the Fire Brigade is £1.3m per annum.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many more thatched roofs are being built every year.{{citation needed|date=July 2018}}

New thatched roofs were forbidden in London in 1212 following a major fire,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://users.trytel.com/~tristan/towns/florilegium/community/cmfabr08.html|title=Florilegium urbanum - Physical fabric - Regulations for building construction and fire safety |date=|website=users.trytel.com|accessdate=6 May 2018 |deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171026234132/http://users.trytel.com/~tristan/towns/florilegium/community/cmfabr08.html |archivedate=26 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and existing roofs had to have their surfaces plastered to reduce the risk of fire. The modern [[Shakespeare's Globe|Globe Theatre]] is one of the few thatched buildings in London (others can be found in the suburb of [[Kingsbury, London|Kingsbury]]), but the Globe's modern, water reed thatch is purely for decorative purpose and actually lies over a fully waterproofed roof built with modern materials. The Globe Theatre, opened in 1997, was modelled on the Rose, which was destroyed by a fire on a dry June night in 1613 when a burning wad of cloth ejected from a special effects cannon during a performance set light to the surface of the thatch. The original Rose Theatre was actually thatched with cereal straw, a sample of which was recovered by Museum of London archaeologists during the excavation of the site in the 1980s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | first = John | last = Letts | title = Unpublished photos and sample records}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Some claim thatch cannot cope with regular snowfall but, as with all roofing materials, this depends on the strength of the underlying roof structure and the pitch of the surface. A law passed in 1640 in [[Massachusetts]] outlawed the use of thatched roofs in the colony for this reason. Thatch is lighter than most other roofing materials, typically around {{convert|7|lb/sqft|abbr=on}}, so the roof supporting it does not need to be so heavily constructed, but if snow accumulates on a lightly constructed thatched roof, it could collapse. A thatched roof is usually pitched between 45–55 degrees and under normal circumstances this is sufficient to shed snow and water. In areas of extreme snowfall, such as [[Minka#Roofing|parts of Japan]], the pitch is increased further.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.addictedtotravel.com/holidays/snow-country|title=Winter Japan at its Best|publisher=Addicted to Travel|accessdate=7 September 2011|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120328175612/http://www.addictedtotravel.com/holidays/snow-country|archivedate=28 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some thatched roofs in the UK are extremely old and preserve evidence of traditional materials and methods that have long since been lost. In northern Britain this evidence is often preserved beneath corrugated sheet materials and frequently come to light during the development of smaller rural properties. [[Historic Scotland]] have funded several research projects into thatching techniques and these have revealed a wide range of materials including broom, heather, rushes, cereals, bracken, turf and clay and highlighted significant regional variation &lt;ref&gt;Walker, B, McGregor, C.&amp; Stark, G  1996  Thatches and Thatching Techniques: A guide to conserving Scottish Thatching Traditions.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7379">The '''Hartwell Paper''' called for a reorientation of [[climate policy]] after the perceived failure in [[2009 United Nations Climate Change Conference|2009 of the UNFCCC climate conference in Copenhagen]]. It was a response to the [[United Nations]]' [[Kyoto Protocol]], a previous international agreement meant to reduce [[greenhouse gas]] emissions. The paper was published in May 2010 by the [[London School of Economics]] in cooperation with the [[University of Oxford]]. The authors are 14 natural and social scientists from Asia, Europe and North America, including [[Mike Hulme]], [[Roger A. Pielke (Jr)]], [[Nico Stehr]] and [[Steve Rayner]], who met under the [[Chatham House Rule]].&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://eprints.lse.ac.uk/27939/1/HartwellPaper_English_version.pdf|title=The Hartwell Paper|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The authors saw the [[Great Recession|2009 economic crisis]] as an opportunity to re-evaluate global priorities. They argued that "decarbonisation will only be achieved successfully as a benefit contingent upon other goals which are politically attractive and relentlessly pragmatic."

[[File:Hartwell House, Bucks.jpg| thumb | right | 200px | [[Hartwell House, Buckinghamshire|Hartwell House]], where the meetings took place.]]

They emphasize [[human dignity]] as a necessary guiding principle for climate [[Climate policy|policy]]: "To reframe the climate issue around matters of human dignity is not just noble or necessary. It is also likely to be more effective than the approach of framing around human sinfulness – which has failed and will continue to fail."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.europeanbusinessreview.com/?p=2303 EU Climate Policy after the Crash of 09.] The European Business Review, September 2010 {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140325063036/http://www.europeanbusinessreview.com/?p=2303 |date=25 March 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

This principle of human dignity is expanded to three main objectives:
* 1. Energy access for all - the paper advocates taking investments in the innovations of renewable energy to decrease energy costs and to make them more affordable to society. Only this diversification of energy could extend the access to energy, especially in undeveloped countries.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

* 2. Development that does not interfere with essential Earth systems.
* 3. Societies well equipped to withstand climate-related dangers.

Their ultimate goal is "to develop non-carbon energy supplies at unsubsidised costs less than those using [[fossil fuels]]."&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;[http://www.lse.ac.uk/collections/mackinderProgramme/theHartwellPaper The Hartwell Paper.] [[London School of Economics]], May 2010&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.economist.com/world/international/displayStory.cfm?story_id=16099521 Oblique strategies], [[The Economist]], 11 May 2010&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/science/nature/8673828.stm After the crash - a new direction for climate policy.] BBC News, 11 May 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

The Hartwell Paper recommends that they are to achieve this goal by introducing low [[carbon]] [[Carbon tax|taxes]]. However, this money is able to be used to develop a CO2 free energy supply.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Kyoto and Climate Change Misconceptions ==

"The previous 'Kyoto' model has dangerously narrowed the option space for thinking seriously and realistically about energy and environmental policies. The Hartwell Paper wishes to contribute to a new pragmatism in the policy discourse surrounding climate change. To this end, we gathered at Hartwell House in Buckinghamshire in February 2010 and this paper is the base of our work".

The Hartwell Paper argues that, although we should attempt to reduce climate change, we must also prepare to adapt if necessary. According to the authors, the Kyoto principles implied that adaptation to the environment should be seen as a failure to halt climate change. Those at the Hartwell meeting proposed that these strategies; mitigation, and adaptation, should both be employed. This is to keep in mind the dignity of those who would be most affected while simultaneously slowing global warming.

The following are climate myths presented in the paper:
* '''Climate change is a problem that must be solved''' - "Rather than being a discrete problem to be solved. Climate change is better understood as a persistent condition that must be coped with and can only be partially managed more – or less – well. It is just one part of a larger complex of such conditions encompassing population, technology, wealth disparities, resource use, etc."&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

* '''The "deficit model" of science''' - The idea that the lack of information hinders the making of environmental progress. Once the science is understood by all, an agreement can be reached. The Hartwell authors call this a myth, saying that it doesn't address the varying political and religious ideologies that can result in differing interpretations of scientific data. "In turn, this error has led to the common and flawed assumption that the solutions to climate change should be ‘science driven’ as if a shared understanding of science will lead to a political consensus."&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

== Key Features of Hartwell Plan ==

The authors propose a holistic model of environmental practice. They believe there has been too much emphasis placed on carbon dioxide as if it is our only problematic emission. They state that while the CO2 reduction is central to the plan, smaller changes in a variety of practices and industries are also important.
* Diversification and moving away from fossil fuels
* Eradication of "Black Carbon" - Black Carbon is simply soot, which can come from burning wood or coal within the home. This has an environmental effect far greater (per ton) than simple CO2. According to the authors, this is an important step to take, as it should be much easier than phasing out gasoline.
* Reduce Tropospheric Ozone
* Protect Tropical Forests
* The "Kaya Identity" - these are four primary factors when it comes to a region's environmental footprint. They are population, wealth, energy intensity, and carbon intensity. Nations face different environmental issues, and the solution for one is not the solution for all.

== Reception and Criticism ==

The Hartwell Paper has received both praise and criticism. According to The Economist, the Hartwell approach to decarbonisation has been a source of controversy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.economist.com/node/16099521|title=Oblique strategies|date=2010-05-11|work=The Economist|access-date=2017-12-04|issn=0013-0613}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because large, rapidly industrializing nations are driven by fossil fuels, the authors claim that slowing this process just isn't politically feasible. ''The Economist'' article argues that Hartwell's "oblique strategies" may be more difficult to turn into policy than a more direct attack on carbon dioxide emissions.

'''Univocity of being''' is the idea that words describing the properties of [[God]] mean the same thing as when they apply to people or things, even if God is vastly different in kind. It is associated with the doctrines of the Scholastic theologian [[John Duns Scotus]].

==Overview==
In medieval disputes over the [[nature of God]], many theologians and philosophers (such as [[Thomas Aquinas]]) held that when one says that "God is good" and that "man is good", man's goodness is only analogous to, i.e. similar to but distinct from, God's goodness.  [[John Duns Scotus]], while not denying the analogy of being a la St. Thomas, nonetheless holds to a univocal ''concept'' of being.  It is important to note that Scotus does not believe in a “univocity of being”, but rather to a common concept of being that is proper to both God and man, though in two radically distinct modes: infinite in God, finite in man.cf. John Duns Scotus, 1265-1965 p. 250-262

[[Gilles Deleuze]] borrowed the doctrine of ''[[ontological]] univocity'' from Scotus.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Widder|first=Nathan|title="John Duns Scotus", in Deleuze's Philosophical Lineage, ed. by Graham Jones and Jon Roffe|year=2009|publisher=Edinburgh University Press|location=Edingburgh|isbn=9780748632992|pages=27-43|url=http://www.elimeyerhoff.com/books/Deleuze/Graham%20Jones,%20Deleuze's%20Philosophical%20Lineage.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;   He claimed that being is univocal, i.e., that all of its senses are affirmed in one voice.  Deleuze adapts the doctrine of univocity to claim that being is, univocally, difference.  "With univocity, however, it is not the differences which are and must be: it is being which is Difference, in the sense that it is said of difference.  Moreover, it is not we who are univocal in a Being which is not; it is we and our individuality which remains equivocal in and for a univocal Being."&lt;ref&gt;Gilles Deleuze, ''[[Difference and Repetition]]'', 1994, p. 39.&lt;/ref&gt;  
Deleuze at once echoes and inverts [[Spinoza]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Berressem|first=Hanjo and Leyla Haferkamp|title=Deleuzian Events: Writing History, ed. Hanjo Berressem and Leyla Haferkamp|year=2009|publisher=LIT Verlag|location=Münster|isbn=978-3643101747|page=210|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=zPgXAZcF4vkC&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;  who maintained that everything that exists is a modification of the one [[substance theory|substance]], [[God]] or [[Nature]]. He claims that it is the organizing principle of Spinoza's philosophy, despite the absence of the term from any of Spinoza's works. For Deleuze, there is no one substance, only an always-differentiating [[process philosophy|process]], an origami cosmos, always folding, unfolding, refolding.  Deleuze and [[Félix Guattari|Guattari]] summarize this ontology in the paradoxical formula "[[pluralism (philosophy)|pluralism]] = [[monism]]".&lt;ref&gt;Gilles Deleuze and Félix Guattari, ''[[A Thousand Plateaus]]'', 1987, p. 20.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{expert needed|Mathematics|date=July 2018}}

In mathematics, and more precisely in [[semigroup]] theory, a '''variety of finite semigroups''' is a set of semigroups having some nice algebraic properties. Those sets can be defined in two distinct way, using either algebraic notions or topological notions.  Varieties of finite [[monoid]], varieties of finite [[ordered semigroup]] and varieties of finite [[ordered monoid]] are defined similarly.

This notion is very similar to the general notion of [[Variety (universal algebra)|variety]] in universal algebra.

== Definition ==
Two equivalent definitions are now given.

=== Algebraic definition ===
A variety ''V'' of finite (ordered) semigroup  is a set of finite (ordered) semigroups which:
*is closed under [[Semigroup#Quotients and divisions|division]]. 
*is closed under taking finite Cartesian product.

The first condition is equivalent to stating that ''V'' is closed under taking subsemigroup and under taking quotient The second property implie that the empty product - that is, the trivial semigroup of one element - belongs to each variety. Hence a variety is necessarily non-empty.

A variety of finite (ordered) monoid is a variety of finite (ordered) semigroup whose elements are monoid. That is, it is a set of (ordered) monoid satisfying the two conditions stated above.

=== Topological definition ===
In order to give the topological definition of a variety of finite semigroup, some other definitions related to [[profinite word]] are needed.

Let ''A'' be an arbitrary finite [[Alphabet (formal languages)|alphabet]]. Let ''A''&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; be its [[free semigroup]].  Then let &lt;math&gt;\hat A&lt;/math&gt; be the set of [[profinite language]]. Given a semigroup [[morphism]] &lt;math&gt;\phi:A^+\to\phi&lt;/math&gt;, let &lt;math&gt;\hat\phi:\hat A\to\phi&lt;/math&gt; be the unique continuous extension of &lt;math&gt;\phi&lt;/math&gt; to &lt;math&gt;\hat A&lt;/math&gt;.

A profinite identity is a pair of [[profinite word]] ''u'' and ''v''.  A semigroup ''S'' is said to satisfy the profinite identity ''u'' = ''v'' if, for each semigroup morphism &lt;math&gt;\phi:A^+\to S&lt;/math&gt;, the equality &lt;math&gt;\hat\phi(u)=\hat\phi(v)&lt;/math&gt; holds.

A variety of finite semigroup is the set of finite semigroup satisfying a set of profinite identities ''P''.

A variety of finite monoid is defined as a variety of finite semigroup, with the exception that one should consider monoid morphism &lt;math&gt;\phi:A^*\to S&lt;/math&gt; instead of semigroup morphisms &lt;math&gt;\phi:A^+\to\phi&lt;/math&gt;.

A variety of finite ordered semigroups/monoids satisfies the same definition, with the exception that one should considered morphisms of ordered semigroup/monoid.

== Examples ==
A few examples of set of semigroups are given. The first examples uses finite identities - that is, profinite identities whose two words are finite words. The next example use  profinite identities. The last one is an example of set which is not a variety.

More examples are given in the article [[Special classes of semigroups]].

=== Using finite identities ===
*The most trivial examples is the variety '''S''' of every finite semigroups. This variety is defined by the empty set of profinite equalities. It is trivial to see that this set of finite semigroup is closed under finite product and quotient.
*The second most trivial example is the variety '''1''' containing only the trivial semigroup. This variety is defined by the set of profinite equality {''x'' = ''y''}. Intuitively, this equally states that each elements of the semigroup are equals.  This set is vacuously closed under finite product and quotient.
*The variety '''Com''' of  commutative finite semigroups is defined by the profinite equality {''xy'' = ''yx''}. Intuitively, this equality states that each pair of elements of the semigroup commute.
*The variety of idempotent finite semigroup is defined by the profinite equality ''xx'' = ''x''.

More generally, given a profinite word ''u'' and a letter ''x'', the profinite equality ''ux'' = ''xu'' states that the images of ''u'' contains only elements of the centralizer. Similarly, ''ux'' = ''x'' states that the image of ''u'' contains left identities. Finally ''ux'' = ''u'' states that  the image of ''u'' is composed of left zeros.

=== Using profinite identities ===
Examples using profinite words which are not finite is now given.

Given a profinite word, ''x'', let  &lt;math&gt;x^\omega&lt;/math&gt; denote &lt;math&gt;\lim_{n\to\infty} x^{n!}&lt;/math&gt;. Hence, given a semigroup morphism &lt;math&gt;\phi:A^+\to S&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\hat\phi(x^\omega)&lt;/math&gt; is the only idempotent power of &lt;math&gt;\phi(x)&lt;/math&gt;.  Thus, in profinite equalities, &lt;math&gt;x^\omega&lt;/math&gt; represents an arbitrary idempotent.

The set of finite semigroup  is a variety, called '''G'''. Note that a finite group can be defined as a finite semigroup, with a unique idempotent, which is a left and right identity. Once those two properties are translated in terms of profinite equality, one casn see that the variety ''G''  is defined by the set of profinite equalities &lt;math&gt; \{ x^\omega=y^\omega \text{ and } x^\omega y=yx^\omega=y\}.&lt;/math&gt;

=== Sets which are not varieties ===
Note that the set of finite monoid is not a variety of finite semigroup. Indeed, this set is not closed under quotient. For example, takes the monoid of non-negative number with addition.  The set of positive number with addition is a semigroup quotient of this monoid and it is not a monoid.

== Reiterman's theorem ==

Reiterman's theorem states that the two definitions above are equivalent. A scheme of the proof is now given.

Given a variety  ''V'' of semigroup as in the algebraic definition, one can choose the set ''P'' of profinite identities to be the set of profinite identities satisfied by every semigroup of ''V''.

Reciprocally, givens a profinite identity ''u'' = ''v'', one can remark that the set of semigroups satisfying this profinite identity is closed under quotient and finite product. Thus this set is a variety of finite semigroups. Furthermore, varieties are closed under arbitrary intersection, thus, given an arbitrary set ''P'' of profinite identity ''u&lt;sup&gt;i&lt;/sup&gt;'' = ''v&lt;sup&gt;i&lt;/sup&gt;'', the set of semigroup satisfying ''P'' is the intersection of the set of semigroups satisfying all of those profinite identities. That is, it is an intersection of varieties of finite semigroup, and this a variety of finite semigroup.

==Comparison with the notion of variety of universal algebra==
The definition of variety of finite semigroup is inspired by the notion of [[Variety (universal algebra)|variety of universal algebra]]. We recall the definition of a variety in universal algebra. Such a variety is, equivalently:
*a set of structure, closed under [[homomorphism|homomorphic]] images, [[subalgebra]]s and [[Direct product#Direct product in universal algebra|(direct) products]].
*a set of structures satisfying a set of [[mathematical identity|identities]].

The main difference between the two notions of variety are now given. In this section "variety of (arbitrary) semigroup" means "the set of semigroup as a variety of universal algebra over the vocabulary of one binary operator". It follows from the definitions of those two kind of varieties that, for any variety ''V'' of (arbitrary) semigroups, the set of finite semigroups of ''V'' is a variety of finite semigroups.

We first give an examples of variety of finite semigroup which is not similar to any subvariety of the variety of (arbitrary) semigroups. We then give the difference between the two definition using identities. Finally, we give the difference between the algebraic definitions.

As shown above, the set of finite group is a variety of finite semigroup. However, the set of group is not a subvariety of the variety of (arbitrary) semigroups. Indeed, &lt;math&gt;\langle\mathbb Z,+\rangle&lt;/math&gt; is a monoid which is an infinite group. However, its submonoid &lt;math&gt;\langle\mathbb N,+\rangle&lt;/math&gt; is not a group. Since the set of (arbitrary) groups contains a semigroup and does not contain one of its subsemigroup, it is not a variety. The main difference between the finite case and the infinite case, when groups are considered, is that a submonoid of a finite group is a finite group. While infinite groups are not closed under taking submonoid.

The set of finite group is a variety of finite semigroups, while it is not a subvariety of the variety of (arbitrary) semigroups. Thus, Reiterman theorem show that this set can be defined using profinite identities. And [[Birkhoff's HSP theorem]] show that this set can not be defined using identities (of finite words). This illustrates why the definition of variety of finite semigroups use the notion of profinite words and not the notion of identities.

We now consider the algebraic definitions of varieties. Requiring that varieties are closed under arbitrary direct product implies that a variety is either trivial or contains infinite structures. In order to restrict varieties to contains only finite structures, the definition of variety of finite semigroups uses the notion of finite product instead of notion of arbitrary direct product.

{{Politics of Singapore}}

The '''right to vote in Singapore''' is not explicitly stated in [[Singapore]]'s [[Constitution of Singapore|Constitution]], but the [[Government of Singapore|Government]] has expressed the view that it may be inferred from the fact that Singapore is a [[representative democracy in Singapore|representative democracy]] and from specific constitutional provisions, including Articles 65 and 66 which set out requirements for the [[Parliament of Singapore#Sessions|prorogation and dissolution of Parliament]] and the holding of [[Parliamentary elections in Singapore|general elections]]. Speaking on the matter in [[Parliament of Singapore|Parliament]] in 2009, the [[Ministry of Law (Singapore)|Minister for Law]], [[K. Shanmugam]], said that the [[suffrage|right to vote]] could not be a mere privilege as this would imply the existence of an institution superior to the body of citizens that is empowered to grant such a privilege, but that no such institution exists in a free country. In 1966 a Constitutional Commission chaired by [[Chief Justice of Singapore|Chief Justice]] [[Wee Chong Jin]] advocated entrenching the right to vote within the Constitution, but this was not taken up by the Parliament of the day. When this proposal was repeated during the 2009 parliamentary debate, the Government took the view that such entrenchment was unnecessary.

In ''[[Public Prosecutor v. Taw Cheng Kong#Constitutional arguments before the High Court|Taw Cheng Kong v. Public Prosecutor]]'' (1998), the [[High Court of Singapore|High Court]] suggested on an ''[[obiter dictum|obiter]]'' basis that voting is a privilege rather than a right. It has been suggested by law academic [[Thio Li-ann]] that, if called upon to decide the issue, the court might infer the existence of the right to vote in the Constitution from its text and structure, and from the fact that it is an adaptation of the [[Westminster system]] of democracy. If the right to vote were to be found to be implicit in the Constitution, the [[judicial system of Singapore|judiciary]] would be better able to protect the right when issues arise before the courts.

The Parliamentary Elections Act and Presidential Elections Act regulate the exercise of the vote and set out the procedures for [[parliamentary elections in Singapore|parliamentary]] and [[presidential elections in Singapore]]. These are ordinary statutes which can be changed by a [[majority|simple majority]] in Parliament. All [[Singaporean nationality law|Singapore citizens]] not less than 21 years old on the cut-off date for the registration of electors (1 January of a particular year), and ordinarily resident in the country, are entitled to vote in both parliamentary and presidential elections. A [[one man, one vote|one person, one vote]] system is currently in operation, though in 1994 [[Senior Minister]] and former [[Prime Minister of Singapore|Prime Minister]] [[Lee Kuan Yew]] suggested that people aged between 35 and 60 who were married with children should be given two votes each due to their greater responsibilities and contributions to society. Overseas voting was introduced in 2001, and first carried out during the [[Singaporean general election, 2006|2006 general election]].

A person is disqualified from voting in certain circumstances, which include engaging in acts incompatible with being a Singapore citizen, being of unsound mind, or being in prison for committing a criminal offence. The constitutionality of the statutory provisions denying prisoners the right to vote has not yet become an issue in Singapore, though it has been controversial in some foreign jurisdictions.

==Introduction==
[[File:Thomas Paine.jpg|thumb|upright|A ''c.'' 1876 portrait of [[Thomas Paine]] (1737–1809) by Auguste Millière, based on an earlier work by [[George Romney (painter)|George Romney]]. Paine, one of the [[Founding Fathers of the United States]], called the [[suffrage|right to vote]] one of an individual's personal rights, which are "a species of property of the most sacred kind".]]

The [[suffrage|right to vote]] forms the foundation of [[representative democracy]], that is, [[democracy]] based on the principle of citizens electing a group of people to represent their interests. The various models of government that fall under the general term "representative democracy", namely, the protective, participatory and elite models, are all based upon the underlying principle of equality of rights, including the right to vote.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|author=Glenn Patmore|title=Making Sense of Representative Democracy and the Implied Freedom of Political Communication in the High Court of Australia: Three Possible Models|journal=[[Griffith Law School|Griffith Law Review]]|year=1998|volume=7|issue=1|pages=97–123 at 99–110}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

"Popular government" was referred to by [[John Stuart Mill]] as "where the supreme controlling power ... is vested in the entire aggregate of the community",&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|author=John Stuart Mill|authorlink=John Stuart Mill|title=Considerations on Representative Government|edition=2nd|location=London|publisher=Parker, Son &amp; Bourn|year=1861|pages=45–69|oclc=644467430}}.&lt;/ref&gt; while [[Edmund Burke]] argued that it has the desirable consequence of establishing a government that has a unified public interest, with its citizens absent of personal prejudices except for that of the public good.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|author=Edmund Burke|authorlink=Edmund Burke|chapter=Speech to the Electors of Bristol, on His Being Declared by the Sheriffs Duly Elected One of the Representatives in Parliament for that City, on Thursday, the 3d of November, 1774|url=http://www.gutenberg.org/files/15198/15198-h/15198-h.htm#ELECTORS_OF_BRISTOL|volume=2|title=The Works of the Right Honourable Edmund Burke|location=London|publisher=John C.

[[Thomas Paine]], one of the [[Founding Fathers of the United States]], said that the right to vote is critical in the protection of individual freedoms. He called it one of an individual's personal rights, which are "a species of property of the most sacred kind", and expressed the view that "[t]o take away this right is to reduce a man to slavery, ... subject to the will of another ... [T]o disfranchise any class of men is as criminal as the proposal to take away property".&lt;ref&gt;Paine, pp. 334 and 336.&lt;/ref&gt; Paine's view was that there is no justification for one part of a community to deny another its right to vote on any basis, whether class, race, religion or political creed. His view survives in various international instruments such as [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights#Article 21|Article 21(1)]] of the [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]].&lt;ref&gt;Art.&amp;nbsp;21(1) of the [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]], [[United Nations General Assembly|General Assembly]] Resolution 217A(III), U.N. G.A.O.R., 3d Sess., Supp. No. 13. U.N. Doc. A/180 (1948), p. 71, declares: "Everyone has the right to take part in the government of his country, directly or through freely chosen representatives".&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[Supreme Court of the United States|United States Supreme Court]] case ''[[Reynolds v. Sims]]'' (1964),&lt;ref&gt;''[[Reynolds v. Sims]]'' {{ussc|377|533|1964}}, [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]] (US).&lt;/ref&gt; [[Chief Justice of the United States|Chief Justice]] [[Earl Warren]] wrote:&lt;ref&gt;''Reynolds'', pp. 555 and 561–562.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|The right to vote freely for the candidate of one's choice is of the essence of a democratic society, and any restrictions on that right strike at the heart of representative government. ... Undoubtedly, the right of suffrage is a fundamental matter in a free and democratic society. ... As long as ours is a representative form of government, and our legislatures are those instruments of government elected directly by and directly representative of the people, the right to elect legislators in a free and unimpaired fashion is a bedrock of our political system.}}

The term ''[[representative democracy in Singapore|representative democracy]]'' does not appear in the [[Constitution of Singapore]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Singapore legislation|title=Constitution|rep=1999}}.&lt;/ref&gt; However, an analogy may be drawn from the approach taken by the [[High Court of Australia]] to the [[Constitution of Australia|Australian Constitution]]. In ''[[Lange v Australian Broadcasting Corporation|Lange v. Australian Broadcasting Corporation]]'' (1997),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite AustLII|litigants=Lange v. Australian Broadcasting Corporation|link=Lange v Australian Broadcasting Corporation|source=HCA|num=25|year=1997|parallelcite=189 C.L.R. 520|courtname=[[High Court of Australia|High Court]]|juris=Australia}}.&lt;/ref&gt; the Court inferred that the Constitution embodies a system of representative and [[responsible government]] from various provisions, including those requiring periodic elections to choose the members of the [[Australian Senate|Senate]] and the [[Australian House of Representatives|House of Representatives]].&lt;ref&gt;''Lange'', pp. 557–559.&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, the Singapore Constitution prescribes that [[Parliament of Singapore|Parliament]] may be dissolved by the [[Prime Minister of Singapore|Prime Minister]] under certain conditions,&lt;ref&gt;Constitution, Arts. 65(2)–(3A).&lt;/ref&gt; and will be automatically dissolved by [[operation of law]] five years from its first sitting.&lt;ref&gt;Constitution, Art.&amp;nbsp;65(4).&lt;/ref&gt; A [[Parliamentary elections in Singapore|general election]] must be held within three months after each dissolution of Parliament.&lt;ref&gt;Constitution, Art.&amp;nbsp;66.&lt;/ref&gt; The Constitution also states that "[t]he President shall be elected by the citizens of Singapore in accordance with any law made by the Legislature",&lt;ref&gt;Constitution, Art. 17(2).&lt;/ref&gt; and requires a poll for the election to be held not more than three months before the incumbent's term of office expires, or, if the office is vacated before the expiry date, within six months of the date when it becomes vacant.&lt;ref&gt;Constitution, Art. 17(3).&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, in the Proclamation of Singapore contained in the Independence of Singapore Agreement,&lt;ref&gt;{{Singapore legislation|title=Independence of Singapore Agreement}}. The Agreement appears in the ''Revised Edition of the Statutes of the Republic of Singapore'' in a section entitled "Constitutional Documents".&lt;/ref&gt; which was entered into by the [[Government of Malaysia|Governments of Malaysia]] and [[Government of Singapore|Singapore]] to effect Singapore's separation from Malaysia, the then Prime Minister [[Lee Kuan Yew]] proclaimed on behalf of the people and the Government that as from 9 August 1965 "Singapore shall be forever a sovereign democratic and independent nation&amp;nbsp;...".

==Status of the right==
===Judicial view===
In ''[[Public Prosecutor v. Taw Cheng Kong#Constitutional arguments before the High Court|Taw Cheng Kong v. Public Prosecutor]]'' (1998),&lt;ref&gt;''[[Public Prosecutor v. Taw Cheng Kong#Constitutional arguments before the High Court|Taw Cheng Kong v. Public Prosecutor]]'' [1998] 1 S.L.R.(R.) [''Singapore Law Reports (Reissue)''] 78, [[High Court of Singapore|High Court]] (Singapore).&lt;/ref&gt; the [[High Court of Singapore|High Court]] expressed the ''[[obiter dictum|obiter]]'' view that the right to vote does not have constitutional status but is a privilege:&lt;ref&gt;''Taw Cheng Kong'', p. 102, para. 56 (emphasis added).&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|Constitutional rights are enjoyed because they are constitutional in nature. They are enjoyed as fundamental liberties – not stick-and-carrot  privileges. To the extent that the Constitution is supreme, those rights are inalienable. Other ''privileges'' such as subsidies or the ''right to vote'' are enjoyed because the Legislature chooses to confer them – they are expressions of policy and political will. [Emphasis added.]}}

===Government's view===
The juridical status of the right to vote was subsequently debated in Parliament on 16 May 2001 upon an [[Parliament of Singapore#Suspension and adjournment|adjournment]] [[motion (parliamentary procedure)|motion]] introduced by [[Non-constituency Member of Parliament]] [[Joshua Benjamin Jeyaretnam]]. Jeyaretnam argued that since "the marking of a [[ballot|ballot paper]] is an expression of the voter", the right to vote is protected by the freedom of expression clause set out in [[Article 14 of the Constitution of Singapore]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Singapore Hansard|mp=J.B. Jeyaretnam|mplink=Joshua Benjamin Jeyaretnam|office=[[Non-constituency Member of Parliament|NCMP]]|title=Is Voting a Privilege or a Right?|url=http://sprs.parl.gov.sg/search/topic.jsp?currentTopicID=00068041-ZZ|date=16 May 2001|volume=73|column=1721}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Responding, the [[Ministry of Home Affairs (Singapore)|Minister for Home Affairs]], [[Wong Kan Seng]], stated:&lt;ref&gt;{{Singapore Hansard|mp=Wong Kan Seng|mplink=Wong Kan Seng|office=[[Ministry of Home Affairs (Singapore)|Minister for Home Affairs]] and [[Parliament of Singapore#Leader of the House|Leader of the House]]|title=Is Voting a Privilege or a Right?|date=16 May 2001|volume=73|column=1726}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|While the Constitution does not contain an expressed declaration of the right to vote, I have been advised by the Attorney General&amp;nbsp;... that the right to vote at parliamentary and presidential elections is implied within the structure of our Constitution. We have a parliamentary form of government. The Constitution provides for regular general elections to make up Parliament and establishes representative democracy in Singapore. So the right to vote is fundamental to a representative democracy, which we are, and that is why we have the Parliamentary Elections Act to give effect to this right.}}

[[File:K Shanmugam (cropped).jpg|thumb|[[Ministry of Law (Singapore)|Minister for Law]] [[K. Shanmugam]], who stated in [[Parliament of Singapore|Parliament]] on 13 February 2009 that the [[suffrage|right to vote]] is an implied [[Constitution of Singapore|constitutional]] right]]

The heading of section 38 of the Parliamentary Elections Act ("PEA")&lt;ref name="PEA"&gt;{{Singapore legislation|title=Parliamentary Elections Act|cap=218|ed=2011}}.&lt;/ref&gt; is "Registers of electors to be conclusive evidence of right to vote". Subsection (1) provides that the current register of electors is conclusive evidence for determining whether a person is entitled to vote at an election, and subsection (2) states that a person's "right and duty of voting" is not prejudiced if there is an appeal pending as to whether his or her name is properly on the register.

The status of the right to vote was again considered in Parliament in 2009. During debates on the [[Ministry of Law (Singapore)|Ministry of Law]]'s annual budget on 12 February, [[Nominated Member of Parliament]] [[Thio Li-ann]] asked if the right to vote is "a constitutional right and part of the fundamental law of the land, or merely a statutory right, regulated by ordinary law?"&lt;ref name="2009 debate: Thio"&gt;{{Singapore Hansard|prefix=Professor|mp=Thio Li-ann|mplink=Thio Li-ann|office=[[Nominated Member of Parliament|NMP]]|title=Head R – Ministry of Law: Legal Status of the Right to Vote and Entrenchment|url=http://sprs.parl.gov.sg/search/topic.jsp?currentTopicID=00073412-ZZ|date=12 February 2009|volume=85|column=3111''[[wikt:ff.#Abbreviation|ff]]''}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Replying to Thio the following day, Minister for Law [[K. Shanmugam]] referred to the 2001 debate on the matter and confirmed that, having conferred with the [[Attorney-General of Singapore|Attorney-General]], in the [[Government of Singapore|Government]]'s view the right to vote is an implied constitutional right arising from various provisions of the Constitution, including Articles 65 and 66.&lt;ref name=Shanmugam&gt;{{Singapore Hansard|mp=K. Shanmugam|mplink=K.

Articles 65(2) to 65(3A) explain when the Prime Minister may dissolve Parliament, while Article 65(4) specifically provides that Parliament has a fixed term: "Parliament, unless sooner dissolved, shall continue for 5 years from the date of its first sitting and shall then stand dissolved." Article 66 states: "There shall be a general election at such time, within 3 months after every dissolution of Parliament, as the [[President of Singapore|President]] shall, by Proclamation in the Gazette, appoint." The Minister also said:&lt;ref name=Shanmugam/&gt;

{{quote|The power of our citizens to vote cannot be a privilege, because that would imply that there is some institution superior to the body of citizens which is in a position to grant such a privilege to the citizens. But in a free country, there is no institution that can be in such a position to grant such a privilege to the citizens. In a Representative Democracy like Singapore, voting is therefore a right, not a privilege.}}

As regards the High Court's view in ''Taw Cheng Kong'', the Minister noted that it could not be treated as a [[precedent]] since "[t]he legal nature of the citizens' right to vote was not an issue in that case and was not specifically argued".&lt;ref name=Shanmugam/&gt; Thio Li-ann has commented that the Minister's clarification "dealt the ''quietus est'' to the High Court's odd pronouncement in ''Taw Cheng Kong v. Public Prosecutor''".&lt;ref name=Thio&gt;{{citation|author=Thio Li-ann|title=Westminster Constitutions and Implied Fundamental Rights: Excavating an Implicit Constitutional Right to Vote|journal=Singapore Journal of Legal Studies|year=2009|pages=406–434 at 409|ssrn=1543638}}. ''Quietus est'' means "he is discharged": {{citation|contribution=''quietus''|editor=Bryan A. Garner|editor-link=Bryan A.

==Proposals to express the right in the Constitution==
===1966 Constitutional Commission===
On 18 January 1966, shortly after [[history of the Republic of Singapore#Independence of Singapore|Singapore's independence]], the President appointed a Constitutional Commission led by [[Chief Justice of Singapore|Chief Justice]] [[Wee Chong Jin]] to consider how the rights of racial, linguistic, and religious minorities in the nascent nation should be protected.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|author=David S[aul] Marshall|authorlink=David Marshall (Singaporean politician)|title=[The Presidential Council:] Paper II|journal=Singapore Law Review|year=1969|volume=1|pages=9–13 at 5}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In its report on 27 August 1966,&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Report of the Constitutional Commission, 1966 [chairman: [[Wee Chong Jin]] C.J.]|location=Singapore|publisher=Government Printer|year=1966|oclc=51640681}}, reproduced in {{citation|author=Kevin Y[ew] L[ee] Tan|author2=Thio Li-ann|title=Constitutional Law in Malaysia and Singapore|edition=2nd|location=Singapore|publisher=[[LexisNexis Butterworths|Butterworths Asia]]|year=1997|at=Appendix D|isbn=978-0-409-99908-2}}.&lt;/ref&gt; the Commission recommended entrenching the right to vote as a "fundamental right" in the form of "the right to elect a government of their choice as expressed in general elections held at reasonable periodic intervals by secret vote".&lt;ref name="1966 Report 43"&gt;''Report of the Constitutional Commission, 1966'', para. 43.&lt;/ref&gt; The chief justification for this proposal was the relatively infant or immature culture of democracy in a newly independent nation that was "barely one year old".&lt;ref name="Thio 410"&gt;Thio, "Westminster Constitutions and Implied Fundamental Rights", p. 410.&lt;/ref&gt; The report noted that citizens had only exercised the right to vote twice in general elections, in [[Singaporean general election, 1959|1959]] and [[Singaporean general election, 1963|1963]] respectively. Hence:&lt;ref name="1966 Report 43"/&gt;

{{quote|The people of Singapore have thus had little experience of general elections nor can it be safely assumed that they have grown up to cherish as an inalienable right, the right to be governed by a government of their own choice, expressed in periodic and general elections by universal and equal suffrage and held by secret vote ... [W]e do not consider it safe to assume that a significant proportion of the people of Singapore will be able to realise, until it is too late to prevent it, that any inroads have been made into the democratic system of general elections by a future government intent on undermining first and ultimately destroying the practice of democracy in Singapore.}}

However, Parliament decided not to entrench the right to vote, instead relegating voting rights to statutory regulation under the Parliamentary Elections Act.&lt;ref name="Thio 410"/&gt;

===2009 parliamentary debate===
During the 2009 parliamentary debate on the right to vote's status, Thio Li-ann proposed that, to avoid doubt, the right should be specifically set out in the Constitution. She argued that entrenching the right to vote through an Article in the Constitution would provide the opportunity to protect the details of the right. Currently, voting is regulated by the PEA.&lt;ref name="PEA"/&gt; As it is an ordinary statute, it can be altered with a simple parliamentary majority by future governments seeking to amend or restrict voting rights. Thio said that expressing the right to vote clearly in the Constitution would allow aspects of that right such as voter secrecy and the universality and equality of votes to be protected from unjust manipulation.&lt;ref name="2009 debate: Thio"/&gt;

[[File:SingaporeConstitution-1999Rep-titlepage-20091226-02.jpg|thumb|left|A copy of the 1999 Reprint of the [[Constitution of Singapore]]]]

However, the Minister for Law said the Government was of the opinion that as the right to vote is an implied right in the Constitution, it was unnecessary for the Constitution to be amended to expressly mention the right. Articles 65 and 66 of the Constitution would be entrenched once Article 5(2A) is brought into force.&lt;ref name=Shanmugam/&gt; That Article, which has remained in abeyance since it was introduced in 1991, provides that a [[bill (proposed law)|bill]] that seeks to amend, among other things, Article 65 or 66, must be supported at a national [[referendum]] by not less than two-thirds of the votes cast, unless the President consents to the amendment. Shanmugam went on to state that the concerns of the 1966 Constitutional Commission were now moot, as Singapore had since experienced ten general elections with a 95% voter turnout each time. Therefore, it could be assumed that the idea and experience of voting were deeply ingrained in Singaporean voters. Furthermore, some countries choose to draft their constitutions in great detail while others, like Singapore, set out a basic philosophy.&lt;ref&gt;This view was repeated by Chong Wan Yieng, Press Secretary to the Minister for Law, in a letter to ''[[Today (Singapore newspaper)|Today]]'' newspaper. She stated that Singapore's legal heritage was a broadly worded constitution: {{citation|author=Chong Wan Yieng|title=A Constitutional Right: MinLaw|url=http://newspapers.nl.sg/Digitised/Article/today20090310-2.2.32.3.aspx|newspaper=[[Today (Singapore newspaper)|Today]]|date=10 March 2009|page=28}}.&lt;/ref&gt; He noted that countries such as North Korea and Myanmar were among those that had set out the right to vote within their constitutions. Shanmugam concluded that what was fundamental to protecting the right to vote was a Government committed to the [[rule of law doctrine in Singapore|rule of law]].&lt;ref name=Shanmugam/&gt; 

Following the parliamentary debate, in a 2009 article Thio elaborated that entrenching the right to vote in the Constitution would make it significantly more difficult for any corrupt government that came into power to curtail it, as a [[supermajority|super-majority]] of at least two-thirds of all [[Parliament of Singapore#Elected Members|elected Members of Parliament]] would be needed before a constitutional amendment could be made.&lt;ref&gt;Constitution, Art.&amp;nbsp;5(2).&lt;/ref&gt; Otherwise, with control over a [[majority|simple majority]] of Parliament,&lt;ref&gt;Constitution, Art.&amp;nbsp;57(1): "Subject to this Constitution, all questions proposed for decision in Parliament shall be determined by a majority of the votes of the Members present and voting ...".&lt;/ref&gt; a ruling party, if it chose to, could direct amendments to the PEA or create new legislation to provide some citizens with, say, double the number of votes and protect this from constitutional challenge using a notwithstanding clause (that is, a provision stated to have legal effect despite the existence of other inconsistent laws). By not protecting such an important right, the freedom of Singapore's electoral system could be progressively curtailed.&lt;ref name="Thio 425"&gt;Thio, "Westminster Constitutions and Implied Fundamental Rights", pp. 425–426.&lt;/ref&gt; A similar point has been made by [[Singapore Management University]] constitutional law professor Jack Lee who noted that since Article 66 does not define the term ''general election'':&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|author=Jack Tsen-Ta Lee|title=Make the implicit explicit: Affirming right to vote in the Constitution would pre-empt the possibility of abuse by future govts &amp;#91;letter&amp;#93;|url=http://ink.library.smu.edu.sg/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1952&amp;context=sol_research|format=PDF|newspaper=Today|date=20 February 2009|page=28}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|... there does not appear to be anything in the Constitution to prevent a future government from, say, requiring all candidates to have their "suitability" for political office determined by a government-appointed committee meeting in private, the decision of which would be final. There could still be a "general election" of sorts, but clearly a {{sic|hide=y|greatly|-}}impoverished version.}}

Thio also argued that without a constitutionally expressed right to vote, the judiciary is handicapped in interpreting this implied right, given its conservative approach to reading the Constitution and the fact that it is unlikely to appeal to normative ideas such as representative democracy.&lt;ref name="Thio 425"/&gt;

==Judicial implication of the right in the Constitution==
Despite the Government's unequivocal view that the right to vote is an implied constitutional right, in Singapore it is the courts that ultimately determine the meaning of the Constitution. Thio Li-ann has suggested that since the right's status is not likely to be brought before the courts in a dispute, the [[Cabinet of Singapore|Cabinet]] should refer the matter to the [[Constitution of the Republic of Singapore Tribunal]] pursuant to Article 100 of the Constitution for an authoritative opinion.&lt;ref&gt;Thio, "Westminster Constitutions and Implied Fundamental Rights", p. 419.&lt;/ref&gt;

Thio has argued that a court convened to determine whether the right to vote exists in the Constitution would give serious weight to the Minister of Law's pronouncements on the status of the right, as to agree with it would affirm rather than challenge executive or legislative power. Also, section 9A of the Interpretation Act&lt;ref&gt;{{Singapore legislation|title=Interpretation Act|cap=1|ed=2002}}.&lt;/ref&gt; requires a [[purposive theory|purposive interpretation]] of written law, including the Constitution, to "promote the purpose or object underlying the written law".&lt;ref&gt;Interpretation Act, s.&amp;nbsp;9A(1).&lt;/ref&gt; Sections 9A(3)(c) and (d) identify ministerial speeches made at the second readings of bills or "any relevant material in any official record of debates in Parliament" as appropriate aspects of the interpretive matrix.&lt;ref&gt;Thio, "Westminster Constitutions and Implied Fundamental Rights", pp. 419–420.&lt;/ref&gt; The court might then take one or both of the following approaches.

===Originalist interpretation===
The courts may choose to establish an imputed intention or traditional understanding of the existence of a right to vote, derived from the drafting style associated with the drafters of [[Westminster system|Westminster]] constitutions rather than the drafted text as it is. Thio has said that the framers of the Constitution worked with certain assumptions which they did not make explicit. In ''Hinds v. The Queen'' (1975),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite BAILII|litigants=Hinds v. The Queen|court=UKPC|year=1975|num=22|format=1|parallelcite=[1977] A.C. 195|courtname=auto|juris=Jamaica}}.&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Judicial Committee of the Privy Council|Privy Council]] said that:&lt;ref name="Hinds 212"&gt;''Hinds'', p. 212.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|... a great deal can be, and in drafting practice often is, left to necessary implication from the adoption in the new constitution of a governmental structure which makes provision for a legislature, an executive and judicature. It is taken for granted that the basic principle of [[separation of powers]] will apply to the exercise of their respective functions by these three organs of government.}}

The court in ''Hinds'' held that, as "a rule of construction applicable to constitutional instruments" adopting the Westminster system, the "absence of express words" did not prevent the judicial powers of the new state being exclusively exercised by the judicature".&lt;ref name="Hinds 212"/&gt; Similarly, the right to vote was necessarily implied into the Constitution through its genesis as an adaptation of the Westminster system of democracy.&lt;ref&gt;Thio, "Westminster Constitutions and Implied Fundamental Rights", pp. 421–422.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Interpretation based on text and structure===
Thio has also argued that the courts may find that an implied right to vote can be derived from the existing structure of the Constitution and a purposive reading of Articles 65 and 66. According to this reading, a constitutional right to vote must be logically or practically necessary for preserving the integrity of that structure, as constitutionally established. In Articles 25 and 26 of the Constitution, the appointment of the Prime Minister requires that he commands "the confidence of the majority of the Members of Parliament". As the Constitution places emphasis on the need for democratic legitimacy as well as general elections, it may be reasonable to infer that the structure of the Constitution provides for a right to vote as a fundamental instrument of democratic legitimacy.&lt;ref&gt;Thio, "Westminster Constitutions and Implied Fundamental Rights", p. 423.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Exercise of the vote==
The Parliamentary Elections Act&lt;ref name=PEA/&gt; regulates the exercise of the vote and sets out the procedures for [[parliamentary elections in Singapore]]. The right to vote in Singapore extends only to [[Singaporean nationality law|Singapore citizens]] who are ordinarily resident in Singapore and not less than 21 years old&lt;ref&gt;PEA, s.&amp;nbsp;5(1). When preparing or revising a register of electors, a Singapore citizen who has been issued an identity card on or before 1 January is [[presumption|presumed]], unless the contrary is proved, to have been ordinarily resident in Singapore on that date, to be at least 21 years old if he or she appears to be of that age based on the records held by the Commissioner of National Registration, and to reside in the electoral division and polling district in which his address is as shown in the Commissioner's records on 1 January: s.&amp;nbsp;5(2).&lt;/ref&gt; on the cut-off date for the registration of electors. This is known as the "prescribed date", and is currently 1 January of a particular year.&lt;ref&gt;PEA, s.&amp;nbsp;5(4) and the Parliamentary Elections (Prescribed Date) Order 2011 ([http://statutes.agc.gov.sg/aol/search/display/view.w3p;page=0;query=DocId%3Ae458cf03-cb38-482c-83e0-efda0198d4e3%20Depth%3A0%20ValidTime%3A03%2F01%2F2011%20TransactionTime%3A03%2F01%2F2011%20Status%3Ainforce;rec=0;whole=yes S 3/2011]).&lt;/ref&gt; A person is considered to be ordinarily resident in Singapore on 1 January in a year if he or she has lived in the country for a total of 30 days during the three years immediately before that date, even if on 1 January the person is not resident in the country.&lt;ref&gt;PEA, s.&amp;nbsp;5(1A).&lt;/ref&gt; Whether people are entitled to vote at a [[presidential elections in Singapore|presidential election]] also depends on whether they are entitled to have their names entered or retained in a register of electors maintained under the PEA.&lt;ref name="Presidential Elections Act"&gt;{{Singapore legislation|title=Presidential Elections Act|cap=240A|ed=2011}}, s.&amp;nbsp;21.&lt;/ref&gt;

Singapore has a [[one man, one vote|one person, one vote]] system: [[plural voting]]&amp;nbsp;– that is, voting more than once in the electoral division that one is assigned to, or voting in more than one electoral division&amp;nbsp;– is illegal.&lt;ref name="PEA s 7"&gt;PEA, s.&amp;nbsp;7.&lt;/ref&gt; Following a relative swing in votes against the ruling [[People's Action Party]] government in the [[Singaporean general election, 1984|general election of 1984]], the Prime Minister [[Lee Kuan Yew]] raised the possibility of modifications to the one person, one vote system and said: "It is necessary to try and put some safeguards into the way in which people use their votes to bargain, coerce, to push, to jostle and get what they want without running the risk of losing the services of the government, because one day, by mistake, they will lose the services of the government."&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=PM replies to voters' signal|newspaper=[[The Straits Times]]|date=24 December 1984|page=1}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Subsequently, in an interview to the US magazine ''[[Foreign Affairs]]'' in January 1994, Lee, now [[Senior Minister]], suggested that a person between the ages of 40 and 60 with a family should be given two votes because "he is likely to be more careful, voting also for his children. He is more likely to vote in a serious way than a capricious young man under 30. But we haven't found it necessary yet. If it became necessary, we should do it. ... I'm not intellectually convinced that one-man, one-vote is the best. We practise it because that's what the British bequeathed us and we haven't really found a need to challenge that."&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|author=Fareed Zakaria|authorlink=Fareed Zakaria|title=Success – a family affair|newspaper=The Straits Times|date=11 March 1994}}; {{citation|author=Anna Teo|title=2 votes each for older people with families a better system – SM Lee|newspaper=[[Business Times (Singapore)|The Business Times]]|date=11 March 1994}}; {{citation|title=People over 40 with children 'should get two votes'|newspaper=The Straits Times|date=11 March 1994}}. See also {{citation|author=George Wong Seow Choon|title=Should all people really be given one vote each?

{{quote|It is not necessary to change our system at present. But, later, we may have to give more weighting to the people whose views should carry more weight because their contributions are greater, and their responsibilities are greater; in which case, we should consider giving those between the ages of 35 and 60, married and with families, one extra vote. Their contribution to the economy and to society is greatest at this stage of life. Also, they need to vote for themselves and also for their children. Their children have an interest that needs to be protected. Once past 60, their children would have grown up, and would vote for themselves. Then the parents should drop back to one vote. But during those critical years, 35–60, people who carry twice as much responsibility should have two votes. This will make for a more viable system and a more stable society.}}

Lee suggested that such a change should perhaps be implemented "in 15 to 20 years" if Singapore's [[birth rate]] had not increased, as policies might then be disproportionately influenced by people aged 60 and over. However, he emphasized that these were his personal views and had not been discussed by the Cabinet.&lt;ref name="ST 19940508"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;See also {{citation|author=Isabella Leung Ning Yim|title=Disappointing if Govt passes this proposal [letter]|newspaper=The Straits Times|date=18 May 1994}}; {{citation|author=Leslie Fong|title=Some-men-two-votes proposal deserves informed discussion|newspaper=The Straits Times|date=21 May 1994}}; {{citation|author=Yap Kim Sang|title=Don't dilute power of the vote of any citizen [letter]|newspaper=The Straits Times|date=24 May 1994}}; {{citation|author=Cherian George|title=Changing the political system a sign of mistrust|newspaper=The Straits Times|date=29 May 1994}}.&lt;/ref&gt; To date, no such modification to the voting system has been made.

===Overseas voting===
Prior to May 2001, voters who were overseas on polling day could not vote. Operational concerns such as insufficient Singapore missions around the world, the possibility that the last known addresses of Singapore citizens overseas might not be current, and the difficulty of keeping track of citizens who were abroad, were cited for this restriction.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|author=Lua Ee Laine|author2=Disa Jek Sok Sim|author3=Christopher Theng Jer Koh|title=Principles and Practices of Voting: The Singapore Electoral System|url=http://heinonline.org/HOL/Page?handle=hein.journals/singlrev17&amp;div=12|journal=Singapore Law Review|year=1996|volume=17|pages=244–321 at 279–280}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Some commentators took the view that such logistical issues should not deprive Singaporeans of their "sacred right to vote".&lt;ref&gt;Lua, Sim &amp; Koh, p. 279.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:SingaporeanEmbassyWashingtonDC01.jpg|thumb|left|upright|The [[Embassy of Singapore, Washington, D.C.|Embassy of Singapore]] in [[Washington, D.C.]], which is one of the venues used as a polling station for overseas voting in [[elections in Singapore|Singapore elections]]]]

Overseas voting was eventually introduced for both parliamentary and presidential elections with effect from 15 May 2001.&lt;ref&gt;By the Parliamentary Elections (Amendment) Act 2001 ([http://statutes.agc.gov.sg/aol/search/display/view.w3p;page=0;query=DocId%3Aa5b32ed0-bcf4-4640-9cdf-633d6f527467%20Depth%3A0%20ValidTime%3A15%2F05%2F2001%20TransactionTime%3A15%2F05%2F2001%20Status%3Apublished;rec=0;whole=yes No. 19 of 2001]) which, according to the Parliamentary Elections (Amendment) Act (Commencement) Notification 2001 ([http://statutes.agc.gov.sg/aol/search/display/view.w3p;page=0;query=DocId%3Add932571-2a0f-4ec0-bd94-e67603b40950%20Depth%3A0%20ValidTime%3A15%2F05%2F2001%20TransactionTime%3A15%2F05%2F2001%20Status%3Ainforce;rec=0;whole=yes S&amp;nbsp;272/2001]), came into force on 15 May 2001. Overseas voting for presidential elections was effected by changes to the Presidential Elections Act which were made by the Parliamentary Elections (Amendment) Act 2001, s.&amp;nbsp;27 and the Sch.&lt;/ref&gt; Speaking during the Second Reading of the bill that led to the change in the law, the Minister for Home Affairs, Wong Kan Seng, said that the Government recognized that increasing numbers of Singaporeans studied and worked abroad due to [[economic globalization]]. Thus, it had decided to introduce overseas voting on a small scale at the next general elections.&lt;ref&gt;{{Singapore Hansard|mp=Wong Kan Seng|office=Minister for Home Affairs|reading=Second|bill=Parliamentary Elections (Amendment)|url=http://sprs.parl.gov.sg/search/topic.jsp?currentTopicID=00067991-ZZ|date=19 April 2001|volume=73|column=1506}}.&lt;/ref&gt; At that time, the law generally required overseas voters to have resided in Singapore for an aggregate of two years during the five-year period before the prescribed date. However, Singaporeans whom the Government had posted abroad were exempted from this requirement and so were their families.&lt;ref&gt;PEA (1999 Rev. Ed.), s.&amp;nbsp;5(1A)(a), inserted by the Parliamentary Elections (Amendment) Act 2001, s.&amp;nbsp;3(a).&lt;/ref&gt; The Minister explained that this requirement for residence in Singapore was a "necessary pre-condition to constituency representation and to prevent plural voting".&lt;ref&gt;Wong Kan Seng, speech during the Second Reading of the Parliamentary Elections (Amendment) Bill (19 April 2001), col. 1508.&lt;/ref&gt; J.B. Jeyaretnam criticized this restriction as discriminating against overseas voters.&lt;ref&gt;Jeyaretnam, speech during the Second Reading of the Parliamentary Elections (Amendment) Bill (19 April 2001), col. 1528.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Jeyaretnam 1722"&gt;Jeyaretnam, "Is Voting a Privilege or a Right?" (16 May 2001), col. 1722.&lt;/ref&gt;

However, following the [[September 11 attacks|terrorist attacks that occurred in the United States on 11 September 2001]] and [[War in Afghanistan (2001–present)|American military action in Afghanistan]] on 7 October, the Government decided to temporarily suspend overseas voting at the [[Singaporean general election, 2001|2001 general election]] as having large numbers of Singaporeans congregating at known locations at known times could put them at risk of further terrorist attacks.&lt;ref&gt;{{Singapore Hansard|mp=Wong Kan Seng|office=Minister for Home Affairs|reading=Second|bill=Parliamentary Elections (Temporary Suspension of Overseas Voting)|url=http://sprs.parl.gov.sg/search/topic.jsp?currentTopicID=00068203-ZZ|date=15 October 2001|volume=73|columns=2448–2449}}. The suspension was effected by the Parliamentary Elections (Temporary Suspension of Overseas Voting) Act 2001 ([http://statutes.agc.gov.sg/aol/search/display/view.w3p;page=0;query=DocId%3A9b0a02bd-fa6b-485a-807d-25802781ca66%20Depth%3A0%20ValidTime%3A26%2F09%2F2001%20TransactionTime%3A17%2F10%2F2001%20Status%3Ainforce;rec=0;whole=yes No. 45 of 2001]), which was deemed to have come into force on 26 September 2001: s.&amp;nbsp;1. The Act suspended the provisions of the PEA allowing for the registration of overseas electors and providing for overseas voting "until polling day of the first general election after the date of commencement of this Act" (s. 2), and thus ceased to have effect after the [[Singaporean general election, 2001|2001 general election]].&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, overseas voting first took place at the [[Singaporean general election, 2006|2006 general election]]. The number of Singapore citizens who registered to vote overseas was 1,017, and of these, 553 resided in the 16 constituencies that were contested in the election. Eventually, 335 electors voted at eight polling stations around the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{Singapore Hansard|mp=Wong Kan Seng|office=Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Home Affairs|reading=Second|url=http://sprs.parl.gov.sg/search/topic.jsp?currentTopicID=00072921-ZZ|bill=Parliamentary Elections (Amendment)|billurl=http://www.parliament.gov.sg/sites/default/files/080008.pdf|date=25 August 2008|volume=84|column=3014}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

With effect from 3 March 2009, the residence requirement for overseas voters was reduced to an aggregate of 30 days during the three years immediately before the prescribed date, and the special dispensation of the requirement applying to citizens working or studying abroad at the Government's direction and their families was removed.&lt;ref&gt;PEA (2007 Rev. Ed.), s.&amp;nbsp;5(1A), as amended by the Parliamentary Elections (Amendment) Act 2008 ([http://statutes.agc.gov.sg/aol/search/display/view.w3p;page=0;query=DocId%3A55413011-c416-4fd7-aca7-e43e0ba678e2%20Depth%3A0%20ValidTime%3A17%2F02%2F2008%20TransactionTime%3A17%2F02%2F2008%20Status%3Apublished;rec=0;whole=yes No. 14 of 2008]), s.&amp;nbsp;3(a).&lt;/ref&gt; The change was described in Parliament as a measure to "allow more overseas Singaporeans to vote. All an overseas Singaporean needs to do is to come home for 10 days a year to visit his family and friends."&lt;ref&gt;Wong Kan Seng, speech during the Second Reading of the Parliamentary Elections (Amendment) Bill (25 August 2008), col. 3014''ff.''&lt;/ref&gt;

===Limitations on voting===
A person is disqualified from voting in the following situations, which include engaging in acts incompatible with being a Singapore citizen, being of unsound mind, or being in prison for committing a criminal offence:

*'''Acts incompatible with Singapore citizenship'''.
**Applying for or acquiring citizenship of another country.&lt;ref&gt;PEA, s.&amp;nbsp;6(1)(a)(i).&lt;/ref&gt;
**Voluntarily claiming or exercising rights in a country outside Singapore, such rights being given exclusively to nationals of that country.&lt;ref&gt;PEA, s.&amp;nbsp;6(1)(a)(ii) read with s.&amp;nbsp;6(1)(3).&lt;/ref&gt;
**Taking an [[oath of allegiance]] to any foreign power.&lt;ref&gt;PEA, s.&amp;nbsp;6(1)(a)(iii).&lt;/ref&gt;
**Applying to another country for a passport of that country.&lt;ref&gt;PEA, s.&amp;nbsp;6(1)(a)(iv).&lt;/ref&gt;
**Being a serving member of any foreign armed force, unless the person is [[domicile (law)|domiciled]] in Singapore.&lt;ref&gt;PEA, s.&amp;nbsp;6(1)(e).&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''Being of unsound mind'''.
**Being found to be of unsound mind.&lt;ref&gt;PEA, s.&amp;nbsp;6(1)(c).&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''Commission of a criminal offence'''.
**Being in prison in any country for an offence punishable with imprisonment for at least 12 months, being under sentence of death, or having been accused or convicted of an offence punishable with at least 12 months' imprisonment and having a [[arrest warrant|warrant of arrest]] relating to the offence in force.&lt;ref&gt;PEA, ss. 6(1)(b), 6(1A) and 6(2).&lt;/ref&gt;
**Having been convicted of a corrupt or illegal practice under the PEA or the Presidential Elections Act,&lt;ref name="Presidential Elections Act"/&gt; or disenfranchised due to a report by an election judge.&lt;ref&gt;PEA, s.&amp;nbsp;6(1)(d).&lt;/ref&gt; Voting in an electoral division that one is not assigned to, or engaging in plural voting amounts to an illegal practice.&lt;ref name="PEA s 7"/&gt;
*'''Removal from register of electors'''.
**Having had his or her name removed from the register of electors, and not having had it restored.&lt;ref&gt;PEA, ss. 6(1)(g) and (h).&lt;/ref&gt;

====Voting in foreign elections====
Singapore citizens who vote in foreign countries may lose their right to vote in Singapore. The relevant provisions are section 6(1)(a)(ii) read with section 6(3) of the PEA:

{{quote|6.— (1) No person shall be entitled to have his name entered or retained in any register of electors if he —
:(a) has done any of the following: ...
::(ii) voluntarily claimed and exercised any rights (other than any rights in connection with the use of a passport) available to him under the law of any country outside Singapore being rights accorded exclusively to the citizens or nationals of that country; ...

(3) For the purposes of subsection (1)(a)(ii), the exercise of a vote in —
:(a) any national, state or provincial election; or
:(b) any election for the local government of any metropolitan or urban area,
in a country outside Singapore (but not an election under this Act or a presidential election) shall be deemed to be the voluntary claim and exercise of a right available under the law of that country.}}

One issue that has arisen is whether a Singaporean who votes in a foreign country where the right to vote is not exclusive to nationals of that country is disqualified from voting in a Singapore election. For instance, the United Kingdom permits citizens of [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]] countries, including Singapore,&lt;ref&gt;[[Representation of the People Act 1983]] ([http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1983/2/contents 1983 c.&amp;nbsp;2]) (UK), ss. 1(1) and 2(1) read with the [[British Nationality Act 1981]] ([http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1981/61/contents 1981 c.&amp;nbsp;61]) (UK), s.&amp;nbsp;37(1)(b) and the 3rd Sch.&lt;/ref&gt; who are resident in the UK and have leave to remain there (or do not require such leave) to register to vote in [[elections in the United Kingdom#General elections|general elections]] and [[elections in the United Kingdom#Regional and local elections|local government elections]].&lt;ref&gt;Representation of the People Act 1983, s.&amp;nbsp;4(6); see also {{citation|title=Who can register to vote?|url=http://www.aboutmyvote.co.uk/who_can_register_to_vote.aspx|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110724123330/http://www.aboutmyvote.co.uk/who_can_register_to_vote.aspx|archivedate=24 July 2011|publisher=[[Electoral Commission (United Kingdom)|Electoral Commission]]|year=2008}}.&lt;/ref&gt; When queried, the [[Elections Department]] stated that since suffrage in the UK is not exclusive to British citizens, Singaporeans who vote there are still eligible to vote in Singapore. However, this interpretation of the PEA has not been tested in court.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|author=Rachel Lin|title=Loophole in S'pore election laws throws up more questions|newspaper=[[The Straits Times]]|date=9 May 2010}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Voting by prisoners====
{{See also|Felony disenfranchisement}}

Another potentially controversial provision is section 6(1)(b) of the Parliamentary Elections Act, which denies suffrage to convicted criminals serving jail sentences. The provision states:

{{quote|6.— (1) No person shall be entitled to have his name entered or retained in any register of electors if he — ...
:(b) is serving a sentence of imprisonment (by whatever name called) imposed by any court in or outside Singapore for an offence punishable with imprisonment for a term exceeding 12 months, or is under sentence of death imposed by any such court or is serving a sentence of imprisonment awarded in lieu of execution of any such sentence ...}}

In addition, section 6(1A) provides as follows:

{{quote|6.— (1A) Without prejudice to subsection (1), no person who is deemed to be ordinarily resident in Singapore under section 5(1A) shall be entitled to have his name entered or retained in any register of electors if he is —
:(a) serving a sentence of imprisonment (by whatever name called) in any prison, jail or other place of detention outside Singapore;
:(b) accused of an offence against any written law punishable with imprisonment for a term exceeding 12 months and a warrant of arrest by a court in Singapore authorising his apprehension in relation to that offence remains in force; or
:(c) convicted by any court in Singapore of any offence punishable with imprisonment for a term exceeding 12 months and a warrant of arrest by a court in Singapore authorising his apprehension in relation to that offence remains in force.}}

The issue of the constitutionality of this restriction has not yet arisen in any Singapore court, but during a Parliamentary debate in May 2001, Non-constituency Member of Parliament J.B. Jeyaretnam challenged the provision as unconstitutional.&lt;ref name="Jeyaretnam 1722"/&gt;

The Singapore position may be compared with the situation in other jurisdictions. In Malaysia, the right to vote is entrenched in Article 119 of the [[Constitution of Malaysia|Federal Constitution]], but suffrage is similarly denied to those serving prison terms.&lt;ref&gt;[[Constitution of Malaysia]], Art.&amp;nbsp;119(3).&lt;/ref&gt; In ''Yazid bin Sufaat v. Suruhanjaya Pilihanraya Malaysia'' (2009),&lt;ref&gt;''Yazid bin Sufaat v. Suruhanjaya Pilihanraya Malaysia'' [2009] 6 M.L.J. [''Malayan Law Journal''] 222, [[Court of Appeal of Malaysia|Court of Appeal]] (Malaysia).&lt;/ref&gt; it was held that while detainees under the [[Internal Security Act (Malaysia)|Internal Security Act 1960]]&lt;ref&gt;[[Internal Security Act (Malaysia)|Internal Security Act 1960]] ([https://web.archive.org/web/20110722235828/http://www.agc.gov.my/Akta/Vol.%202/Act%2082.pdf Act 82, 2006 Reprint]), archived from [http://www.agc.gov.my/Akta/Vol.%202/Act%2082.pdf the original] on 22 July 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;&amp;nbsp;– who have not been convicted of any crime&amp;nbsp;– still enjoy the right to vote in national elections, that right may only be exercised only in the constituencies they are registered in, and does not extend to allowing them to vote while incarcerated elsewhere.&lt;ref&gt;''Yazid bin Sufaat'', pp. 229 and 235, paras. 3 and 30–31.&lt;/ref&gt;

A survey of European countries reported in ''[[Hirst v United Kingdom (No 2)|Hirst v. United Kingdom (No. 2)]]'' (2005),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite BAILII|litigants=Hirst v. United Kingdom (No. 2)|link=Hirst v United Kingdom (No 2)|court=ECHR|year=2005|num=681|parallelcite=(2006) 42 E.H.R.R. 41|courtname=auto}} (Grand Chamber).&lt;/ref&gt; a judgment of the [[European Court of Human Rights]], found that 18 states allowed prisoners to vote without restriction (Albania, Azerbaijan, Croatia, the Czech Republic, Denmark, Finland, Germany, Iceland, Lithuania, Macedonia, Moldova, Montenegro, the Netherlands, Portugal, Slovenia, Sweden, Switzerland and Ukraine), while in 13 states all prisoners were not allowed to vote (Armenia, Belgium, Bulgaria, Cyprus, Estonia, Georgia, Hungary, Ireland, Russia, Serbia, Slovakia, Turkey and the United Kingdom). In another 13 states, the right to vote could be restricted in some way (Austria, Bosnia and Herzegovina, France, Greece, Italy, Luxembourg, Malta, Norway, Poland, Romania, Spain, Latvia and Liechtenstein).&lt;ref&gt;''Hirst'', para. 33.&lt;/ref&gt; In ''Hirst'', the [[Government of the United Kingdom|UK Government]]'s denial of the vote to prisoners was ruled contrary to [[European Convention on Human Rights#Article 3 - elections|Protocol 1, Article 3]], of the [[European Convention on Human Rights]], which protects the right to regular, free and fair elections. The European Court said that the UK had to justify any deviation from universal suffrage, but the UK Government has so far desisted from applying the judgment after the [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom|House of Commons]] voted on 10 February 2012 to maintain the country's blanket ban on voting by prisoners.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|author=Nicholas Watt|author2=Alan Travis|title=MPs decide to keep blanket ban on prisoners' vote: Ministers drawing up compromise proposals after cross-party motion wins a majority of 212|url=https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2011/feb/10/mps-blanket-ban-prisoners-vote?intcmp=239|newspaper=[[The Guardian]]|location=London|date=10 February 2012}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Every Canadian Needs A Copy.jpg|thumb|A woman distributing copies of the [[Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms]]. [[Section Three of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms|Section 3]] of the Charter guarantees the right to vote.]]

In Canada, the [[Supreme Court of Canada|Supreme Court]] held in ''[[Sauvé v. Canada (Chief Electoral Officer)]]'' (2002),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite CanLII|litigants=Sauvé v. Canada (Chief Electoral Officer)|link=Sauvé v. Canada (Chief Electoral Officer)|source=scc|year=2002|num=68|parallelcite=[2002] 3 S.C.R. 519|courtname=auto}}.&lt;/ref&gt; that a statutory provision prohibiting prisoners serving a sentence of two years or more from voting unjustifiably infringed the fundamental right to vote guaranteed by [[Section Three of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms|section 3]] of the [[Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms]], Pt. I of the [[Constitution Act, 1982]] (Canada), itself Sch. B of the [[Canada Act 1982]] ([http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1982/11/contents 1982 c.&amp;nbsp;11]) (UK).&lt;/ref&gt; The Court noted that the [[Government of Canada|Government]] could not demonstrate how denying prisoners the vote helped the stated aims of the relevant statute; a democracy built on inclusiveness, democracy and citizen participation cannot be party to a law that disenfranchises a considerable part of the population. There was also no credible theory why prisoners should be denied the right to vote as a form of punishment, as it is arbitrary and not related to the offender's criminal act nor does it deter crime or rehabilitate criminals.&lt;ref&gt;''Sauvé'', paras. 20–53.&lt;/ref&gt;

The foregoing cases may be contrasted with the position in the United States. The [[Supreme Court of the United States]] held in ''[[Richardson v. Ramirez]]'' (1974)&lt;ref&gt;''[[Richardson v. Ramirez]]'' {{ussc|418|24|1974}}, [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]] (US).&lt;/ref&gt; that a California statute permanently removing the right to vote from any person convicted of an "infamous crime" unless the right to vote was restored by court order or executive pardon did not violate the [[Equal Protection Clause]] of the [[Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fourteenth Amendment]] to the [[United States Constitution]]. The Court noted that there was explicit constitutional approval for laws [[disfranchisement|disenfranchising]] [[felony#United States|felons]] since section 2 of the Amendment reduced a state's representation in [[United States Congress|Congress]] if the state has denied the right to vote for any reason "except for participation in rebellion, or other crime". Thus, it was unnecessary for the statute in question to be narrowly tailored to serve compelling state interests to be consistent with equal protection.&lt;ref&gt;''Richardson'', pp. 54–56.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1964">'''Well-founded phenomena''' ({{lang-la|phenomena bene fundata}}), in the [[philosophy]] of [[Gottfried Leibniz]], are ways in which the world falsely appears to us, but which are grounded in the way the world is (as opposed to [[dream]]s or [[hallucination]]s, which are false appearances that are not thus grounded).

For Leibniz, the universe is made up of an infinite number of simple [[Substance theory|substance]]s or [[Monad (philosophy)|monad]]s, each of which contains a representation of the entire universe (past, present, and future), and which are all causally isolated from one another ("Monads have no windows through which anything could enter or depart."&lt;ref&gt;Leibniz, "The Monadology" (1714), §7.&lt;/ref&gt;)  For the most part the monads' perceptions are more or less confused and obscure, but some of them correspond either to the ways in which other monads are related or to the ways that the representation is genuinely ordered; these are the well-founded phenomena.

In the world of ordinary experience we might call a [[rainbow]] a well-ordered phenomenon; it appears to us to be a coloured arch in the sky, though there is in fact no arch there.  We are not suffering from hallucinations, though, for the appearance is grounded in the way the world is ordered&amp;nbsp;– in the behaviour of light, dust motes, water particles, etc.

For Leibniz, there are two main categories of well-founded phenomena: the ordinary world of individual objects and their interactions, and more abstract phenomena such as [[space]], [[time]], and [[causality]]. This is also found in his expression of [[pre-established harmony]] being the basis of causation.

'''Zenker's turaco'''  (''Tauraco persa zenkeri''), is a subspecies of the [[Guinea turaco]]. It is a green turaco, in the family [[Musophagidae]], subfamily Tauracinae, a group of near-passerines birds. Zenker's turaco is found in forests of Central Africa in the Congo Basin in Gabon, DR Congo and Congo Brazaville and south to northern Angola. It forms part of a superspecies complex that extends from West Africa to East Africa and as far south as the Cape in Southern Africa and include the [[black-billed turaco]], Emin's, [[Schalow's turaco]],  [[Livingstone's turaco]], the [[Transvaal turaco]] and the [[Knysna turaco]], as subspecies within the group.&lt;ref&gt;Forshaw and Cooper, 2002, Turacos, The Natural History of Musophagidae&lt;/ref&gt;
