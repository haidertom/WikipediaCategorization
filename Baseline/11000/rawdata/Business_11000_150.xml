      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1939">'''Andreas Panagopoulos''' ({{lang-el|Ανδρέας Παναγόπουλος}}, 1883 - 1952) was a [[Greece|Greek]] politician and four times mayor of [[Agrinio]], being considered one of the city's most important mayors.

He was born in [[Agrinio]] in 1883 and to Anastasis Panagopoulos, a trader whose origin was from [[Kalavryta]]. Andreas studied in a private school in [[Corfu]]. He became involved in the [[tobacco]] industry, and founded the '''Panagopoulos Bros.''' firm, one of the most famous [[tobacco]] companies in Greece.

He became mayor of the city of Agrinio for three consecutive terms from 1925 to 1934, and again from 1951 to 1952, when he died.  He was one of the most important mayors. Among his achievements were the completion of the civic street plan, its electrification, the paving of its roads, the construction of a modern aqueduct in 1930, the building of the Central Municipal market in 1932, and the commencement of archaeological digs to uncover the remains of the ancient city of Agrinion. He also served briefly as an MP in 1935-1936.

A central street in Agrinio, as well as the square in front of the city hall, bear his name. On the same square lies his family's mansion, which has been declared a historic monument.

==Early life==
Andy Lau was born in [[Tai Po]], [[Hong Kong]], a son of a [[fireman]] (劉禮). His family was considered to be wealthy as his grandfather was a landowner, but his father left with him to the slums of [[Diamond Hill]] when he was six, where the area was full of wooden houses, and was burnt down when he was eleven. As a young boy, Lau had to fetch water for his family up to eight times a day because their house was not equipped with [[plumbing]].&lt;ref name="radio86"&gt;{{cite web| website= Radio86.co.uk| url= http://www.radio86.co.uk/explore-learn/culture/1266/andy-lau-from-tiger-to-heavenly-king?comment=1| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20150610202632/http://www.radio86.co.uk/explore-learn/culture/1266/andy-lau-from-tiger-to-heavenly-king?comment=1 |archivedate=10 June 2015 |title= Andy Lau: From tiger to heavenly king| access-date= 31 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; He graduated from a Band One secondary school, [[Ho Lap College]] in [[San Po Kong]], [[Kowloon]].&lt;ref name="sina2"&gt;{{cite web| website= Sina.com| url= http://news.sina.com/m/2007-08-25/02061688771.shtml | title= 五虎"恩怨：李家乘和劉德華的終極PK| language= | date= | accessdate= 31 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was named as Lau Fook-wing (劉福榮) during his academic years.

==Career==
===Actor===
{{see also|Andy Lau filmography}}
In 1981, Lau signed up for the artist training program offered by [[Television Broadcasts Limited|TVB]], which is where his acting career began.&lt;ref name="yes1"&gt;{{cite web| website= Yesasia.com| url= http://www.yesasia.com/us/yumcha/andy-lau-the-face-of-hong-kong/0-0-0-arid.10-en/featured-article.html | title= Andy Lau – The Face of Hong Kong| language= | date= | access-date= 1 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The lead role which led to his initial popularity was in the 1982 [[TVB]] series ''[[The Emissary (TV series)|The Emissary]]''. In 1983, Lau's role as ''"[[Yang Guo]]"'' in the TVB ''[[wuxia]]'' series, ''[[The Return of the Condor Heroes (1983 TV series)|The Return of the Condor Heroes]]'' (神鵰俠侶) further increased his popularity. From then on, he would take on many of the lead roles in many TVB series.

In September 1983, TVB was looking to increase their ratings in competition with Korea and Japan for the best variety show.  The station then created the show ''TVB All-star challenge'' (星光熠熠勁爭輝) featuring almost the entire line-up of the most popular actors and singers at the time.&lt;ref name="big5ch1"&gt;{{cite web| website= Big5.china.com| url= http://big5.china.com/gate/big5/lianzai.china.com/books/html/436/1981/17462.html |title= [Unknown] | publisher= }}{{dead link|date=July 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted= yes }}." ''第二章 影視新星 無線電視臺的五虎將''. Korea referred as Goryeo (高麗). Retrieved on 31 January 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; Lau, along with [[Tony Leung Chiu-wai|Tony Leung]], [[Michael Miu]], [[Felix Wong]], and [[Kent Tong]] were branded as the "[[Five Tiger Generals of TVB]]" (無線五虎將) due to their popularity on the show.&lt;ref name="big5ch1" /&gt;

In the late '80s, Lau left [[TVB]] due to contract problems. TVB wanted to bind him to an exclusive five-year contract which Lau refused to sign, so TVB [[blacklist]]ed him. He then focused on his film career.&lt;ref name="radio86"/&gt;

In 1981, Lau made a guest appearance in one of [[Susanna Kwan]]'s music videos and caught the eye of the manager [[Teddy Robin]].&lt;ref name="sina1"&gt;{{cite web| work= Sina.com| url= http://dailynews.sina.com/bg/ent/chnstar/sinacn/20091206/2258938138.html | title= 劉德華 一張老臉 還擄少女心| date= | access-date= 27 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Teddy Robin then gave Lau a chance to play a small role in the movie ''Once Upon a Rainbow''.&lt;ref name="sina1" /&gt; This was the first step in Lau's film acting career.&lt;ref name="sina1" /&gt; He landed a role in [[Ann Hui]]'s 1982 film ''[[Boat People (film)|Boat People]]''.&lt;ref name="yes1" /&gt; Later in 1983 he had his first leading role in the [[Shaw Brothers Studio|Shaw Brothers]]-produced action film, ''[[On the Wrong Track]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| website= Lovehkfilm.com| url= http://www.lovehkfilm.com/reviews_2/on_the_wrong_track.htm | title= Film review |date= | access-date= 31 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One of his early leading roles included the more serious 1988 film, ''[[The Truth (1988 film)|The Truth]]'' (法內情). However, Lau is best known in films for his (often) recurring roles as a "Heroic Gangster", such as [[Wong Kar-wai]]'s 1988 film ''[[As Tears Go By (film)|As Tears Go By]]'', and [[Benny Chan (film director)|Benny Chan]]'s 1990 film ''[[A Moment of Romance]]''.

Though a respectable actor, Lau was initially known more for his handsome features.  Some people he has worked with have called him a [[matinee idol]], but he has claimed to be an artist.&lt;ref name="Time1" /&gt; Lau has proved his acting skills in many of his films. His first major acting prize came with ''[[A Fighter's Blues]]'', which was his first [[Golden Bauhinia Awards|Golden Bauhinia Award]] for Best Actor.&lt;ref&gt;Dianying.com. "[http://www.dianying.com/ft/awards/goldenbauhinia/28 Dianying.com]." ''第 6 屆金紫荊獎頒獎''. Retrieved on 31 January 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; He would win the [[Hong Kong Film Award for Best Actor]] award that year for ''[[Running Out of Time (1999 film)|Running out of Time]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url= http://www.hkfaa.com/history/list_19.html|title=19th Hong Kong Film Awards|language=Chinese|publisher=Official website of [[Hong Kong Film Awards]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2004, he won the prestigious [[Golden Horse Award for Best Leading Actor]] for his performance in ''[[Infernal Affairs III]]'', the second sequel to the popular ''[[Infernal Affairs]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| website= Dajiyuan.com| url= http://www.dajiyuan.com/b5/4/12/4/n737526.htm| title= 第41屆金馬獎 劉德華稱帝楊貴媚封后| language= | access-date= 31 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; He is also known to Western audiences for starring in ''[[wuxia]]'' films such as ''[[House of Flying Daggers]]'', which was nominated for an [[Academy Award for Best Cinematography]].

In 2005, Lau received the "No.1 Box office Actor 1985–2005" award of Hong Kong, yielding a box office total of [[Hong Kong dollar|HKD]] 1,733,275,816 for shooting 108 films in the past 20 years.&lt;ref name="radio86" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Madamet"/&gt; The aforementioned figure is as compared to the first runner-up [[Stephen Chow]]'s (HKD 1,317,452,311) and second runner-up [[Jackie Chan]]'s (HKD 894,090,962). "I've never imagined that it would be as much as 1.7&amp;nbsp;billion!" he told reporters.  For his contributions, a wax figure of Lau was unveiled on 1 June, 2005 at the [[Madame Tussauds Hong Kong]].&lt;ref name="Xinhuanet.com"&gt;{{cite web| website= Xinhuanet.com| url= http://news.xinhuanet.com/english/2005-06/02/content_3034722.htm |title= Wax figure of Andy Lau unveiled| date= | access-date= 31 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2007, Lau also received the "Nielsen Box Office Star of Asia" award by the [[Nielsen Company]] ([[ACNielsen]]).&lt;ref name="Focus Films" /&gt;

===Film producer===
In 1991, Lau set up his own film production company, [[Teamwork Motion Pictures]], which in 2002 was renamed to [[Focus Group Holdings Limited]]. His contributions in the film industry as well as his involvement in nurturing new talent in the Asian film industry led him to winning the "Asian Filmmaker of the Year" award in the [[Pusan International Film Festival]] in 2006.&lt;ref name="Focus Films" /&gt; Some of the films Lau has produced include award-winning films, ''[[Made in Hong Kong (film)|Made in Hong Kong]]'' and ''[[A Simple Life]]'', his 100th film, ''[[A Fighter's Blues]]'' the Chinese digital film ''[[Crazy Stone (film)|Crazy Stone]]'', and big budget action blockbusters, ''[[Firestorm (2013 film)|Firestorm]]'' and ''[[Shock Wave (film)|Shock Wave]]''.

===Musical career===
[[File:Andylau in concert 4.30.2011-02.jpg|thumb|250px|Andy Lau in concert 2011]]
{{see also|Andy Lau discography}}
Lau released his first album ''"Only Know that I Still Love You"'' (只知道此刻愛你) under [[Capital Artists]] in 1985.&lt;ref name="radio86" /&gt; This album was not a big hit,&lt;ref name="radio86" /&gt; but despite having a voice not traditionally associated with popular music, Lau's hard work and perseverance resulted in him becoming one of the most successful singers in [[Cantopop]]. His singing career reached stellar status in 1990 with the release of the album entitled ''"Would It Be Possible"'' (可不可以), and his subsequent releases only solidified his status as a marketable singer.&lt;ref name="radio86" /&gt; For that song, he would win his first [[1990 RTHK Top 10 Gold Songs Awards]].  He would then win at least one [[RTHK Top 10 Gold Songs Awards|RTHK award category]] every year consecutively until the year 2007.

From [[Jade Solid Gold Top 10 Awards]] he has won the "Most Popular Hong Kong Male Artist" award 7 times and the "Asia Pacific Most Popular Hong Kong Male Artist" award 15 times.&lt;ref name="radio86" /&gt; He was also entered into the [[Guinness World Records]] for "Most Awards Won by a Cantopop Male Artist". By April 2000, he had already won an unprecedented total of 292 awards.&lt;ref name="radio86" /&gt;

Many of Lau's songs quickly topped the music charts not only in Hong Kong, but also in Taiwan, [[Mainland China]], and in many different parts of Asia.  Some of his most notable hits include "The Days We Spent Together" (一起走過的日子), "If You Are My Legend" (如果你是我的傳說), "The Tide" (潮水), "Forget Love Potion" (忘情水), "True Forever" (真永遠), "Chinese people" (中國人), "Love You Forever" (愛你一萬年), "You Are My Woman" (你是我的女人), and "Secret Admiration" (暗裡著迷).  Besides singing in [[Cantonese]] and [[Standard Chinese|Mandarin]], he has also sung in other languages such as English, Japanese, [[Malay language|Malay]], and [[Taiwanese Hokkien]].  One example of a Hokkien song was (世界第一等), and he has also performed a Cantonese cover of Joan Jett's "[[I Hate Myself for Loving You]]" (我恨我痴心).

Since the early 1990s, Lau, along with [[Jacky Cheung]], [[Aaron Kwok]], and [[Leon Lai]] have been referred to by the Chinese media as the Cantopop [[Four Heavenly Kings (Hong Kong)|Four Heavenly Kings]].&lt;ref name="X1" /&gt;

Lau sang alongside [[Jackie Chan]] during a part of the [[2008 Summer Olympics closing ceremony]] on 24 August, 2008. In addition, Lau, who has been supporting disabled athletes in Hong Kong for more than a decade, was appointed as the Goodwill ambassador for the [[2008 Summer Paralympics]].&lt;ref name="sina English"&gt;{{cite web| url= http://english.sina.com/sports/p/2008/0906/184566.html|title=Beijing Paralympic theme song shows love for life |website= Sina.com| date= September 6, 2008| access-date= }}&lt;/ref&gt; He led other performers in singing and performing the song ''"Everyone is No.1"'' at the [[Beijing National Stadium]] just a few hours before the [[2008 Summer Paralympics#Opening ceremony|2008 Paralympics opening ceremony]] began.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://english.peopledaily.com.cn/95374/95375/6494350.html|title=Beijing 2008 Paralympic Games |website= peopledaily.com.cn}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also sang the theme song "Flying with the Dream" with [[Han Hong (singer)|Han Hong]] during the Paralympics opening ceremony on 6 September 2008.&lt;ref name= "sina English" /&gt;

As a songwriter, Lau's only creative works are as a lyricist. Most of the songs he has written have been for himself.

===Appearance in other media===
Lau is alleged to have been featured as a [[non-player character]] (NPC) as a random pedestrian in a [[Nonlinear gameplay|sandbox-style]] action video game called ''[[Prototype (video game)|Prototype]]''. On 6 July, the Hong Kong local newspapers [[Headline Daily]] and [[Sing Tao Daily]] reported on Lau's cameo.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url= http://www.hkheadline.com/digital/digital_content.asp?contid=58389&amp;srctype=g&amp;catid=878|title=頭條日報 頭條網 - 變種戰士易容鬥法|website= hkheadline.com | date= | access-date= | language= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Lau was severely injured on 16 January 2017, when he was thrown off and stomped on by a horse during a commercial shoot in [[Thailand]]. The commercial was released in March, but with all horses and horse-riding scenes cut from the final version. By the end of 2017, Lau had fully recovered from his injuries.

==Community service==
In 1994, Lau established the ''Andy Lau Charity Foundation'' which helps people in need and promotes a wide range of youth education services.&lt;ref name="Focus Films" /&gt; In 1999, he received the ''Ten Outstanding Young Persons of the World'' award, being the third person from Hong Kong at that time to receive this distinguished honour.&lt;ref name="Focus Films" /&gt; In 2008, Lau took a main role in putting together the [[Artistes 512 Fund Raising Campaign]] for relief toward the victims of the [[2008 Sichuan earthquake]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url= http://english.sina.com/p/1/2008/0522/162101.html |website= Sina.com | title= Artistes 512 preparation pictures| access-date= 31 May 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was one of the largest and most ambitious charity events ever assembled in the territory.

Lau was noted for his active involvement in charity works throughout his 30 years in showbiz and honoured as a "Justice of Peace" by the Hong Kong SAR government in 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| website= Xinhuanet.com| url= http://rss.xinhuanet.com/newsc/english/2008-07/02/content_8476704.htm| title= [Unknown]| publisher= | date= 2 July 2008 | access-date= }}{{dead link|date=October 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; In May 2010, he received the "World Outstanding Chinese" award and an "honorary doctorate" from the [[University of New Brunswick]], Canada.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.takungpao.com/news/10/05/06/UHK-1253612.htm Ta Kung Pao]{{dead link|date=October 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}."  Retrieved on 6 May 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; On 14 December, 2017, Lau was awarded a [[Doctor of Letters]] degree from the [[Hong Kong Shue Yan University]], with the citation highlighting his popularity among locals which stated: “His low-key, modest, friendly and approachable personality has endeared him to millions of fans and ordinary folks alike, who also consider him to be a ‘heartthrob’ and the ‘unofficial Chief Executive of [Hong Kong].”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.scmp.com/news/hong-kong/education/article/2124382/hong-kong-superstar-andy-lau-receives-honorary-doctorate%3famp=1 |title=Hong Kong superstar Andy Lau receives honorary doctorate, hopes to be role model for young people |date=December 15, 2017 |accessdate=2018-06-25 }}{{Dead link|date=August 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal life==
In 2008, Lau married [[Malaysian Chinese]] Carol Chu after 24 years of speculation over their relationship.&lt;ref name="cna"&gt;{{cite news| url= http://www.channelnewsasia.com/stories/entertainment/view/1001713/1/.html|title=Andy Lau admits to marrying Carol Chu last year|date=30 August 2009|work=Channel News Asia| publisher= MediaCorp| accessdate=21 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The couple married in [[Las Vegas]].&lt;ref name="cna"/&gt; On 9 May, 2012, Chu gave birth to their first child, a daughter, Hanna.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://entertainment.xin.msn.com/en/celebrity/buzz/asia/andy-lau-is-now-a-dad|title=Andy Lau is now a dad|date=11 May 2012|work=Xin MSN Entertainment |accessdate=21 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In January 2017, Lau was seriously injured after being thrown off and stomped by a horse during a commercial shoot in Khao Lak, an area three hours outside of Thailand’s capital city, Bangkok.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url= http://www.scmp.com/news/hong-kong/education-community/article/2063226/hong-kong-actor-andy-lau-injured-after-being|title=Andy Lau injured after being thrown off a horse| website= scmp.com| publisher=| date= January 19, 2017| access-date= July 25, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.scmp.com/news/hong-kong/education-community/article/2064604/hong-kong-star-andy-laus-recovery-take-least-six|title=Hong Kong star Andy Lau’s recovery to take up to nine months after being thrown from horse on shoot|date=2017-01-23|newspaper=SCMP/News/Hong Kong/Education|access-date=2018-09-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, Lau was able to make a full return to work in August 2017, stating he has recovered 95 per cent from his injuries and has fully recovered by the end of the year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.straitstimes.com/lifestyle/entertainment/andy-lau-says-he-has-recovered-95-per-cent-from-his-horse-riding-accident|title=Andy Lau says he has recovered 95 per cent from his horse-riding accident}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://entertainment.toggle.sg/en/entertainment/asianbuzz/article/andy-lau-speaks-out-about-his-recovery-process-9150102|title=Andy Lau speaks out about his recovery process}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Banking business process outsourcing''' or '''banking BPO''' is a highly specialized sourcing strategy used by [[bank]]s and lending institutions to support the business acquisition and account servicing activities associated with the customer lending lifecycle.  These specific BPO services are usually offered through multi-year [[service-level agreements]] for all or portions of the [[credit card lending]], [[consumer lending]] or [[commercial lending]] segments of the financial services market. Some larger financial services organizations choose to extend their sourcing strategy to include other outsourced services such as [[Information Technology Outsourcing|ITO]] systems and software, [[human resources outsourcing]] and benefits services, [[finance and accounting outsourcing]] (FAO) services, procurement or [[training outsourcing]].

Banking BPO services are typically defined by industry analysts, advisors and leaders in the sourcing industry, such as the set of discrete processes or transactional activities that support the  lending lifecycle as follows:
* '''New customer acquisition services''' include [[telemarketing]] activities, application processing, [[underwriting]], customer or merchant credit evaluation and verification, credit approval, [[document processing]], account opening and [[customer care]] and on-boarding.
* '''Account servicing processes''' for [[credit cards]] or [[consumer loan]]s. These most commonly include payment processing systems and services, customer service or [[call center]] support operations (voice, digital, email and mail services), product renewals, and loan disbursement; [[document management]] services such as printing and mailing of statements, networked printing and storage solutions; [[collection (payment)|collection]]s, recoveries processing, default management, risk management and [[foreclosure]].
* '''Consumer and commercial lending''' post origination transaction processing services, such as check processing, clearance and settlement services, [[remittance]], and [[records management]].
* '''Back office transaction process management''' for loans or credit card portfolios, including custody services, [[fraud]] mitigation and detection, regulatory and program [[compliance (regulation)|compliance]], portfolio [[analytics]], reporting, conversions, management of technology platforms, interface for customer data and custom development.

'''Birra Moretti''' is an [[Italy|Italian]] [[Brewery|brewing company]], founded in [[Udine]] in 1859 by Luigi Moretti, with the name of ''Beer Factory and Ice''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=BIRRA MORETTI: LA STORIA|url=http://www.fermentobirra.com/la-birra-italiana/birra-moretti-la-storia/|publisher=fermentobirra}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1996 the company was acquired by [[Heineken International]]. The brewing plant in Udine was sold to the newly formed Birra Castello S.p.A.; Moretti is now a [[Heineken brands#Birra Moretti|brand of Heineken]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=BIRRA: HEINEKEN ITALIA ACQUISTA MORETTI|url=http://www1.adnkronos.com/Archivio/AdnAgenzia/1996/02/26/Economia/BIRRA-HEINEKEN-ITALIA-ACQUISTA-MORETTI_135600.php|date=February 26, 1996|publisher=Adnkronos}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
===Brand history===

Birra Moretti was founded in 1859 by the great Luigi Moretti in [[Udine]], which at that time was still part of the [[Austrian Empire]], and its first name was the ''Beer and Ice Factory''. The first bottles went on sale in 1860. In those years, both the production and consumption of beer in [[Italy]] were much lower than they are today. The company was initially expected to produce 250,000 litres of beer a year, enough to meet the provincial demand.&lt;ref&gt;[http://95.110.198.57/agora/Birra-Moretti-una-lunga-storia?debut_articles_rubrique=45 Birra Moretti: una lunga storia italiana. Da 150 anni il gusto della sincerità.&lt;!-- bot-generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; 

The Moretti family continued to own the brewery and business until 1989, when it was sold to a consortium of other brewers, then in 1996 it was bought by the Dutch firm of [[Heineken]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www1.adnkronos.com/Archivio/AdnAgenzia/1996/02/26/Economia/BIRRA-HEINEKEN-ITALIA-ACQUISTA-MORETTI_135600.php Birra: Heineken Italia acquista Moretti] [[Adnkronos|adnkronos.it]]&lt;/ref&gt; The company also now owns the Birra Moretti trademark.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title=Birra Moretti - Informazioni Societarie | url=http://www.birramoretti.it/info.htm |date=June 24, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The original factory in Udine was closed in 1992, after the brewing was transferred to [[San Giorgio di Nogaro]], also in [[Friuli]].

Following the finding by the Italian [[Antitrust]] Authority that Heineken occupied a dominant position in the Italian market,&lt;ref&gt;M. Patucchi, [http://ricerca.repubblica.it/repubblica/archivio/repubblica/1996/05/28/inciampa-il-gigante-della-birra.html Inciampa il gigante della birra], [[La Repubblica (quotidiano)|La Repubblica]], 28 May 1996&lt;/ref&gt; the company was forced to sell the brewery in San Giorgio di Nogaro in 1997. It was subsequently bought by a new brewing consortium called the [[Birra Castello]] group, which now owns the property. Production of Birra Moretti beers was then moved to various other plants around Italy controlled by the [[Heineken]] group, such as those at [[Assemini]], [[Comun Nuovo]], [[Massafra]], and [[Pollein]].

In 2015, Heineken launched six new Birra Moretti products: two new [[Radler]], Birra Moretti Radler [[Gazzosa]], and [[Chinotto]] as well as six beers dedicated to the culinary traditions of many Italian regions: Birra Moretti to [[Friuli]], Birra Moretti [[Sicily|Sicilian]], Beer Moretti [[Piedmont]]ese, Birra Moretti [[Tuscany|Tuscan]], Birra Moretti [[Apulia|Apulian]], and that of [[Lucana]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.agroalimentarenews.com/rubrica-file/-Le-Regionali---arriva-sugli-scaffali-la-nuova-gamma-della-birra-Moretti.htm "Le Regionali", arriva sugli scaffali la nuova gamma della birra Moretti] agroalimentarenews.com&lt;/ref&gt;

===Moustache Moretti history===

On the company's official website, it is said that in 1942 the [[Commendatore]] Lao Menazzi Moretti saw an elderly [[mustached]] gentleman sitting at a table in the historical [[trattoria]] Boschetti of [[Tricesimo]] in the province of [[Udine]]. Moretti, thinking that the man could represent his beer very well, decided he would ask permission to photograph him in exchange for a reward to the man's liking. "Che al mi dedi di bevi, mi baste" - said the man in the [[Friulian language]], or "Give me to drink, enough for me".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.birramoretti.it/una-storia-tutta-italiana/la-storia-del-baffo/|title = La storia del Baffo - Birra Moretti|date = 2015-09-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; That photo was later handed over to the illustrator Segala, alias Franca Segala, who designed the famous [[manifesto]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.imagazine.it/news/2995#.VmsocV5BG1w|title = Michele Tomaselli - "il Baffone che soffia" - nov - dic 2015; iMagazine.|date = 2015-12-11|website = www.imagazine.it}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another version, however, states that the photo was taken by the German photographer [[Erika Groth-Schachtenberger]] in 1939. The photo portrayed a Tyrolean farmer from [[Thaur]] in [[Tyrol (state)|Tirol]], only a few kilometers from [[Innsbruck]]. Groth would not have authorized the use of his picture if he knew it would be used for the Moretti advertising campaigns in 1956. He would see himself in a billboard and this discovery would also have resulted in a legal dispute.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://messaggeroveneto.gelocal.it/tempo-libero/2015/09/11/news/cosi-erika-groth-immortalo-il-mitico-baffone-1.12079220|title = Cosí Erika Groth immortalò il mitico Baffone  - Tempo Libero - Messaggero Veneto|date = 2015-09-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|author = Achim Johann Weber|url = https://opus.bibliothek.uni-augsburg.de/opus4/files/1076/Weber_Groth_Schmachtenberger.pdf|title = Erika Groth-Schmachtenberger (1906 - 1992) : Augenblicke in Schwarzweiß ; Porträtversuch einer großen bayerischen Fotografin anläßlich ihres 100.

Over the years, the [[Moustache]] was played by various actors; the most familiar face was that of the famous actor and voice actor [[Marcello Tusco]], replaced after his sudden death, by [[Orso Maria Guerrini]].

===Football trophy===
From 1997 to 2008, the Birra Moretti sponsored [[Birra Moretti Trophy]], an invitational [[summer]] football [[tournament]]. The first three editions were held in [[Udine]], the birthplace of the company. Each edition saw the participation of three teams competing for 45 minutes like many other friendly summer tournaments. After the first three editions, the tournament moved first to the [[Stadio San Nicola]] in [[Bari]] and, then to the  [[Stadio San Paolo]] in [[Naples]] from 2005 to 2008.

===Moretti stadium===
Stadio Moretti was built in [[Udine]] as a multi-use stadium. The capacity of the stadium was 25,000 spectators. It also hosted speedway events. The stadium was first used as the home of the Udinese Calcio football matches. The venue, however, moved to the Stadio Friuli in 1976. Stadio Moretti was demolished in 1988 and in its place now stands a city park, which was named after the great soccer player, Udine [[Alfredo Foni]]. 

===Birra Moretti Football===
Birra Moretti Football, or simply BMC, was a football online game whose players, coaches and fans are real people. The site was opened on 6 June 2006.

== Public and charity activity ==

In the frame of his mandate of President of the Kazakhstan Tennis Federation, Bulat Utemuratov has developed various charity associations in relation with this sport for Kazakh youth. Upon his initiative, the “Team Kazakhstan” tennis Academy was created specifically to train promising players of the national tennis team. Since 2010, Kazakhstan is regularly ranked among the world's top tennis nations. 
From September 2015, Utemuratov has been a board member of the [[International Tennis Federation]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.itftennis.com/news/215120.aspx&lt;/ref&gt; In 2017, the International Tennis Federation and [[Asian Tennis Federation]] awarded Bulat Utemuratov for transcendent merit in the development of tennis in the region&lt;ref&gt;http://asiantennis.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Newsletter-November_ATF-AGM.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 2014 he founded the Private Charity Fund of Bulat Utemuratov&lt;ref&gt;http://utemuratovfoundation.org/&lt;/ref&gt; and he has been a
member of the Board of Trustees ever since. The main goal of the Fund is working towards the
healthy development of autistic children and providing adequate child support.

'''Capability management''' is the approach to the management of an organization, typically a business organization or firm, based on the "[[theory of the firm]]" as a collection of capabilities that may be exercised to earn revenues in the marketplace and compete with other firms in the industry. "Capability Management" seeks to manage the stock of capabilities within the firm to ensure its position in the industry and its ongoing profitability and survival.

Prior to the emergence of capability management, the dominant theory explaining the existence and competitive position of firms, based on [[Ricardian economics]], was the [[resource-based view of the firm]] (RBVF). The fundamental thesis of this theory is that firms derive their profitability from their control of resources – and are in competition to secure control of resources. Perhaps the best-known exposition of the Resource-based View of the Firm is that of one of its key originators: economist [[Edith Penrose]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Edith Penrose|title= The Theory of the Growth of the Firm|publisher=New York, John Wiley and Sons|year=1959|isbn=978-0-19-828977-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

"Capability management" may be regarded as both an extension and alternative to the RBVF that asserts that it is not control over physical resources that is the basis for firm profitability but that "Companies, like individuals, compete on the basis of their ability to create and utilize knowledge;...".&lt;ref&gt;Leonard, 1998&lt;/ref&gt; In short, firms compete not on the basis of control of resources but on the basis of superior [[Know-How]]. This Know-How is embedded in the capabilities of the firm – its abilities to do things that are considered valuable (in and by the market).

==Types of (business) capability==

Leonard defines three types of business capability that a firm might possess: Core Capabilities, Enabling Capabilities and Supplemental Capabilities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Leonard|first1=Drothy|title=Wellsprings of Knowledge|date=1995|publisher=Harvard Business School Press|isbn=0-87584-612-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Core Capabilities are defined as those "built up over time", that "cannot be easily imitated" and therefore "constitute a competitive advantage for a firm". They are distinct from the other types of capability and sufficiently superior to similar capabilities in competitor organizations to provide a "sustainable competitive advantage". It is implied that such core capabilities are the product of sustained, long [[organizational learning]].

Supplemental Capabilities are defined as those that "add value to core capabilities but that could be imitated".

Enabling Capabilities are defined as those that "are necessary but not sufficient in themselves to competitively distinguish a company." In other words, enabling capabilities are those which a firm has to do, in support of its normal operations and core capabilities, but which are not themselves core capabilities (because they could be imitated, developed quickly or would not be very different from competitors' capabilities). Enabling capabilities are distinguished from supplemental capabilities in that they are required, but do not necessarily add value to core capabilities.

A business capability is ''what'' a company needs to do to execute its [[business strategy]] (e.g., enable ePayments, tailor solutions at point of sale, demonstrate product concepts with customers, combine elastic and non-elastic materials side by side, etc.).

Another way to think about a capability is that it is an assembly of people, process and technology for a specific purpose.&lt;ref&gt;Ric Merrifield, Jack Calhoun and Dennis Stevens "The Next Revolution in Productivity", (''Harvard Business Review'', June, 2008)&lt;/ref&gt;

Capability Management is the active management, over time, of the portfolio of capabilities in a firm – their development and depreciation in conscious response to changes in the business environment.

Capability management is an approach that uses the organization's customer value proposition to establish performance goals for capabilities based on value contribution. It helps drive out inefficiencies in capabilities that contribute low customer impact and focus efficiencies in areas with high financial leverage; while preserving or investing in capabilities for growth.

==Distinctive capabilities==

Oxford economist [[John Kay (economist)|John Kay]] defines Distinctive Capabilities as those capabilities a firm has which other firms cannot replicate even after they realize what the benefits are that owning the capability confers. These distinctive capabilities are the source or superior performance of successful firms. Kay's Distinctive Capabilities may be identified with Leonard's inimitable and hard-won "Core Capabilities". However, Kay goes further in arguing that in order for a capability to be truly distinctive and the basis for competitive advantage it must meet two further criteria: sustainability and appropriability.

Sustainability refers to the firm maintaining the distinctiveness and superiority of the capability relative to other firms despite their efforts to imitate or replicate it. One approach to sustainability is for the firm to develop the capability faster than the competitors through learning and innovation.

Appropriability refers to the firm securing the benefits of the capability – or the exercising of its capability – for itself as opposed to those benefits accruing to the firm's customers, its staff – management or employees, or its shareholders, regulators or other stakeholders. [[Intellectual Property Rights]] are one means for securing appropriability.

On the basis of analysis of empirical data regarding the performance of companies Kay argues that there are only a few types of distinctive capability that meet the additional criteria. Three are said to recur in the analysis: Innovation, Architecture and Reputation. These are briefly discussed below.

==Capability or competency?==

In a 1990 edition of the [[Harvard Business Review]], [[Gary Hamel]] and [[C.K.Prahalad]] published an article entitled "The Core Competence of the Corporation" which defined the notion of  a "[[core competency]]". Core Competencies are identified by three criteria: 1) they are difficult for competitors to imitate 2) they make a substantial contribution to a number of the firm's products (or services) they give the firm access to several markets and 3) they make a substantial contribution to the perceived customer-value of the products (or services). The (superior) competitive position of the firm's products (or services) in its markets is thought to be the expression of the firm's competitive advantage. Hamel and Prahald go on to assert that core competencies are the result of "collective learning across the corporation".

Since that publication there has been active debate in the academic literature as to whether (the concept of) "core competencies" is the same notion as core capabilities.  Several authors consider that the concepts are the same, the differences purely terminological, and use the terms interchangeably while others insist there is a substantive distinction. Given the similarities in their definitions it is a reasonable position to think they are the same. However, neither Leonard, nor Hamel and Prahalad (nor indeed Kay) were philosophically precise enough in their definitions and expositions of the concepts for the identity to be definitively established. One reasonable position is that "core competencies" are a view of "core capabilities" from a customers and products perspective while "core capabilities" are a view of "core competencies" from the perspective of knowledge and skills and staff and suppliers in firms. This may reflect the philosophical biases of their respective institutions.

Others, such as [[Max Boisot]], take the view that competence or competency is some measure of the level of performance in a capability or that competence is a much narrower concept than capability. Hence a firm may have a high or low level of competence in a particular, notional, abstract capability. There is some evidence that general managers often fail to appreciate the subtlety of the definition of "core competencies" and over-estimate the degree of their firm's competence in common capabilities. Consequently, they over-identify "things the firm is good at" as core competencies – which falls foul of the distinctiveness criterion for a core capability (and/or the inimitability criterion of core competencies and core capabilities). Hence some things managers mistakenly identify as "core competencies" may be more properly considered as Enabling or Supplemental Capabilities.

When applying the concepts of "core competence" or "core capability" academics and practitioners should be clear and precise as to their intended semantics for these ambiguous terms.

==Structure of a capability -or- dimensions of a core capability==

Leonard analyzes the nature of a (business) capability and concludes that core capabilities "comprise at least four interdependent dimensions" (pp.&amp;nbsp;19) as follows:
# Physical technical systems – machinery, databases, software systems etc.
# Managerial systems – systems for the management of operations, including operation of technical systems
# Skills and Knowledge (systems) – systems for the maintenance of personal and team skills and knowledge
# Values and Norms – systems for the regulation of behaviours and objectives in organizations
[[File:Dimensions of a Core Capability.jpg|thumb|right|Dimensions of a Core Capability]]
Around this complex of systems that realize a core capability Leonard situates a loop "Capability-Creating Activities" that comprise "Shared Problem Solving" and encompass Present and Future and Internal and External Perspectives (see Leonard, 1995, chapter 3). This capability development loop, is considered a system of organizational learning (knowledge-creating and knowledge-diffusing activities) and comprises the following activities:
#Problem Solving (in the context of the PRESENT)
#Implementing and Integrating (in the INTERNAL context)
#Experimenting (in the context of the FUTURE)
#Importing Knowledge (from the EXTERNAL context)
These activities, however, do not form a simple cycle or sequence and may be conducted in any order and several "in parallel" around any particular capability. It is these knowledge-creating and knowledge-diffusing (or knowledge-acquiring and knowledge-sharing) activities that make the capability dynamic (change over time) in the Leonard model.

Clearly, Leonard takes a [[System-of-Systems]] perspective on organizational or business or enterprise capabilities – and this establishes the link to the notion of a [[Capability (systems engineering)|Capability]] in [[Systems Engineering]]. Given that the Leonard model of a capability incorporates elements of skills and knowledge, and is adaptive and intelligent in the sense of importing knowledge from the external context, experimenting and problem-solving, while moving from present to future, it may be considered an ICASOS – an Intelligent Complex Adaptive System-of-Systems – model of an enterprise or firm. Note that the knowledge created and diffused in the Leonard model is organizational knowledge, not personal knowledge and is Know-How, not Know-That, that is often [[Tacit Knowledge]].

According to Hadaya and Gagnon, in their book ''Business Architecture - The Missing Link is Strategy Formulation, Implementation and Execution'', a business capability is an integrated set of resources designed to work together to achieve a particular result&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/989865288|title=Business architecture : the missing link in strategy formulation, implementation and execution|last=Hadaya|first=Pierre|last2=Gagnon|first2=Bernard|publisher=ASATE Publishing|year=2017|isbn=9780994931900|location=Montréal|pages=59-60|oclc=989865288}}&lt;/ref&gt;. A capability is always made up of one or more business functions, business processes, organizational units, know-how assets, information assets and technology assets. ″For example, to have the capability to Fabricate Metal Parts, an organization must have the necessary machines (technology assets), the knowledge of how to operate them (know-how assets), the specific sequence of activities needed to fabricate the parts (process), the drawings of the parts to be fabricated (information assets), and the teams of people (organizational units) specializing in the various types of fabrication required to make the parts (business functions)″&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;. According to these authors, some capabilities also include one or more brands or natural resource deposits. Indeed, ″the Coca Cola Company could not sell 1.9 billion servings a day in more than 200 countries were it not for the power of its brands″&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;. In turn, for a farmer to be able to Produce Vegetables, he must have not only the right business functions, business processes, organizational units, know-how assets, information assets and technology assets, but also a piece of land (natural resource deposit) on which to grow his vegetables. A business capability can also be made up of lower-level capabilities. For example, to have the capability to manufacture cars, an organization must have several lower-level capabilities, including the capability to manufacture engines and the capability to fabricate and assemble the bodywork of the cars.

The consideration of a portfolio of capabilities in an enterprise in the context of the PRESENT and FUTURE contexts, with the Importing of Knowledge from the EXTERNAL context and the Implementing and Integrating of Knowledge in the INTERNAL context, establishes the link to [[Enterprise Architecture]]. In Enterprise Architecture this knowledge and planning of present-to-future evolution is diffused through the medium of models shared and used throughout the enterprise.

==Dynamic capabilities theory==
The Leonard model of a Capability is a dynamic model at the micro-level; focused on the detailed mechanisms for development and change of individual capabilities. Building on the work of Hamel and Prahalad, and others [[David Teece]] and colleagues developed a macro-level theory of [[Dynamic capabilities]] and framework for their management. In this theory a (or perhaps ''the'') "Dynamic Capability" is defined as "the firm’s ability to integrate, build, and reconfigure internal and external competences to address rapidly changing environments."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Teece, D., Pisano, G., &amp; Shuen, A.|title=Dymamic Capabilities and Strategic Management|journal=Strategic Management Journal|date=1997|volume=18|issue=7|doi=10.1002/(sici)1097-0266(199708)18:7&lt;509::aid-smj882&gt;3.0.co;2-z }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Building on earlier work from the 1960s, the central thesis of the Dynamic Capabilities theory is that "... the real key to a company's success or even to its future development lies in its ability to find or create a competence that is truly distinctive". In this literature the term "competence" is used in both the sense of degree of performance in some capability and as a low-level, short-term capability. Competence in the latter sense echoes the concepts from Hamel and Prahalad, but may also be identified with Leonard's Enabling and Supplemental Capabilities as well as the short-term Core Capabilities of a firm. The term "capabilities" is also used somewhat interchangeably with "competencies".

The competencies or low-level capabilities are regarded as assets or knowledge-resources of the enterprise, alongside physical assets and other resources that are difficult for competitor firms to acquire. In this sense Teece's Dynamic Capabilities Theory is a move back towards the Resource-Based View of the Firm, but with a broader notion of "Resources" that includes intangible knowledge-based and practice-based resources, not just tangible assets. In the Dynamic Capabilities Theory, "Resources" are firm-specific assets that are difficult for competitors to acquire or imitate, "Organizational Routines" (based on prior work of Nelson and Winter) or "Organizational Competences" are the low-level capabilities of the firm and "Core Competences" are taken from the Hamel and Prahalad concept. Citing Dorothy Leonard (or Leonard-Barton), Teece et al. define (higher-level) Dynamic Capabilities as the "ability to integrate, build and reconfigure" these tangible and intangible assets.
"Dynamic Capabilities thus reflect an organizations ability to achieve new and innovative forms of competitive advantage given path dependencies and market positions."

"Path dependencies" refers to the history of development of organizational knowledge embedded in its capabilities, routines and technological assets – echoing the concept from Leonard, but on a macro-scale and explaining why competitive advantage takes time and persistence to build. The incorporation of "Routines" and path-dependent development of firms in the theory establishes the link to evolutionary theories of management and (business) strategy.

The Dynamic Capabilities Theory also refers to notions of coherence, congruence and complementary assets across the firms portfolio of assets, routines, competencies and capabilities. This has resonances with similar notions of coherence in [[System-of-Systems Engineering]] and in [[Enterprise Architecture]].

Teece et al. also discuss Technological Assets, Structural Assets and Reputational Assets – echoing the three recurrent categories of Distinctive Capability identified by John Kay – Innovation, Architecture and Reputation. The discussion of technological assets and technology-based competences establishes the link to [[Technology Management]] and [[Technology Strategy]]. Teece et al. also discuss organizational structure, market/industry structure, organizational boundaries, notions of co-specialization in assets, cross-firm integration and the trade-offs between hierarchical management control and a nexus of contracts. This presages notions of the "[[Virtual Enterprise]]" or "Extended Enterprise" and establishes the link to [[Enterprise Architecture]].

It can be seen therefore that Dynamic Capabilities Theory is a highly integrative theory of the firm that links a wide range of fields including Business Strategy, Strategic Management, Knowledge Management, Technology Management, Technology Strategy, Systems Thinking, Enterprise Architecture or Enterprise Engineering and others.

From the perspective of Dynamic Capabilities Theory, Capability Management is the approach to management that focuses on the development of the portfolio of capabilities (resources, assets, routines, knowledge etc.) available to the firm, and the meta level capability of reconfiguring them and integrating them for market exploitation and competitive advantage.

==Capability management in defence==

[[Capability management in defence]] has a history dating back to the early years of the 21st Century.
The [[UK Ministry of Defence]] adapted the existing [[DoDAF]] architecture framework to the procurement practices of what was then the MOD Procurement Executive, later Defence Equipment and Support, – in particular a [[Capability management]] approach to Defence procurement called "Through-Life Capability Management" (TLCM). The DoDAF was extended with additional 'Views' for capability planning and notions of capability configurations and capability increments. These views were standard ways to represent how the capabilities in some segment of the Defence Enterprise (such as the Army, Navy or Air Force) were expected to or planned to evolve over time, given investments by MOD and the UK Government. This was published in 2004 as the MOD Architecture Framework ([[MODAF]]) version 1.0. The current, and probably last, version of MODAF is 1.4. This will be the last version since MOD intends to migrate to the forthcoming new version of the [[NATO Architecture Framework]], which incorporates much from MODAF, including the concepts and views of capability planning. The notion of capability in MODAF, however, is slightly different from the notion of capability in, for example, Dynamic Capabilities Theory.

In MODAF "Capability" refers to a ''military'' capability – an ability to produce military effects – or enabling or supporting capabilities. Nevertheless, the central thesis that politico-military conflicts or business competitions in markets are contests in which the organisation or enterprise with the superior capabilities wins holds. On this basis the same capability-based strategy and planning techniques are thought to be effective in both spheres.

The aim of "Through-Life Capability Management" (TLCM) was to promote in defence procurement a shift of perspective away from a focus on military equipment towards what was really required from UK Defence organizations: the capabilities, or abilities to produce effects in the world that enhance UK national security. The MOD considers that such capabilities are delivered by trans-organisation networks of operational units across the Defence Enterprise – and hence uses the terminology "[[Network Enabled Capability]]" (NEC). This is (a part of) MOD's interpretation of the concept of [[Network Centric Warfare]] which itself was a 1990s interpretation of a [[System-Of-Systems]] approach or perspective in the context of Defence.

The earlier cultural focus on equipment had led to over-specification, incoherent equipment purchases, unnecessary duplication, an over-emphasis on initial purchase costs, insufficient consideration of recurrent support and maintenance costs, project and programme delays and significant cost overruns that the UK Government could no longer tolerate. TLCM promoted a capability lifecycle perspective, that sought a balanced investment profile in time that would minimise whole-life costs, while efficiently producing effective, coherent and maximally cost-effective Defence capabilities over the medium term – and thereby ensuring maximum Value-for-Money for the UK taxpayer from Defence. TLCM was therefore central to the strategic planning of the evolution of the UK Defence Enterprise. While formally superseded, elements of TLCM live on in MOD's whole-systems, non-equipment-centric System-Of-Systems Approach, which was mandated in UK Defence Strategic Direction in 2013.

==Capability management and enterprise architecture==

Capability-based planning had long been entrenched in the Defense realm in the US, UK, Australia, and Canada before it was adopted within Version 9 of [[The Open Group Architecture Framework|The Open Group Architecture Framework (TOGAF)]]. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url =http://pubs.opengroup.org/architecture/togaf9-doc/arch/chap32.html#tag_32_02 | title =Capability-Based Planning Paradigm | date =2011 | publisher =[[The Open Group]] | access-date =18 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Capability Management has in recent years become a popular sub-discipline or method of [[Enterprise Architecture]]. Enterprise Architecture seeks to build a rigorous model of an enterprise that identifies its component parts and their relationships for the purpose of planning the evolution of the enterprise. A Capability Management perspective – such as Leonard's model or Teece's Dynamic Capabilities Theory – suggests that a firm is best viewed as a collection of capabilities that have a composition from and configuration of the tangible and intangible assets of the firm. In this view the firm and its portfolio of capabilities evolve in response to the (perceived) demands of the business environment. An enterprise may comprise one or more firms, or parts of firms (or other types of organization) and their interrelationships – and so is describable (may be modelled) in the same terms.

In the IBM Enterprise Architecture Method, the "Enterprise Capabilities Neighborhood" – a segment of the overall Enterprise Architecture description or model – "captures the strategic intent of the enterprise". It "provides the bridge from the organization's strategy to the architectural building blocks that enable and realize the strategy."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|editor-last=Doucet |editor-first=G. |editor2-last=Gotze |editor2-first=J. |editor3-last=Saha |editor3-first=P. |editor4-last=Bernard |editor4-first=S.|last=Collins |first=F.C. |last2=De Meo |first2=P.|chapter=Realizing the Business Value of Enterprise Architecture through Architecture Building Blocks|title=Coherency Management – Architecting the Enterprise for Alignment, Agility and Assurance|date=2011|publisher=AuthorHouse|isbn=978-1-4389-9606-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the IBM EA Method, "Both the Enterprise Capabilities and Business Architecture are technology independent." It is not clear how this view can be rationalised and made coherent with the Leonard model or the Teece theory which places some technology-implemented system at the center of a capability. Collins and De Meo go on to assert that "To focus the EA (description) on delivering the right plan for the enterprise, it must be based on a detailed understanding of the Enterprise Capabilities the enterprise has decided it needs...". Collins and De Meo's "Enterprise Capabilities" can thus be identified with Leonard's "Core Capabilities". The IBM EA Method defines the "Strategic Capability Network" which "depicts the strategic capabilities and associated enablers of a business, their interrelationships and their combined roles and significance in ... the value net of a business." The SCN is therefore a modeling technique and [[network theory|network analysis]] method that expresses both the Leonard model of Core, Enabling and Supplemental capabilities, the Hamel and Prahalad notion of core competencies and, given EA's time dimension of enterprise evolution, the Dynamic Capabilities Theory.

==Capability management topics==

===Capability vs. process===
A process is ''how'' the capability is executed. Much of the reengineering revolution or [[Business process reengineering]] focused on how to redesign business processes.

===Business vs. organizational capability===
An organization capability refers to the potential of the people in an organization and their [[cooperation]] to get things done.&lt;ref&gt;Dave Ulrich and Norn Smallwood, How Leaders Build Value: Using People, Organization, and Other Intangibles to Get Bottom-Line Results (Jossey-Bass, 2006)&lt;/ref&gt;  The way leaders foster shared mindset, talent, change, accountability, and collaboration across boundaries define the company's culture and leadership edge.

===Capability vs. competency===
[[Dave Ulrich]] makes a distinction between capabilities and [[competence (human resources)|competencies]]: individuals have competencies while organizations have capabilities.  Both competencies and capabilities have technical and social elements.

{| class="wikitable"
|-
!  !! Individual !! Organization
|-
| Technical|| Functional Competencies|| Business Capabilities
|-
| Social|| Leadership Competencies|| Organizational Capabilities
|}

At the individual-technical intersection, employees in the firm bring functional skills and competencies such as programming, cost accounting, electrical engineering, etc. At the individual-social intersection, leaders also have a set of competencies or skills such as setting the strategic agenda and building relationships. Moving to the intersection of organizational and technical, are business capabilities. In short, they are the technical things or what the firm must know how to do to execute strategy. For example, a financial service firm must know how to manage risk and design innovative products.
Finally, we have organization capabilities such a talent management, collaboration, and accountability. They integrate all the other parts of the firm and bring it together. When leaders have mastered certain competencies, organization capabilities become visible. For example, when a leaders master "turning vision in to action" and "aligning the organization," the organization a whole shows more [[accountability]].

==History of capability modeling in business==
Capability management's earlier ancestors include the [[value chain]], also known as value chain analysis, first described and popularized by [[Michael Porter]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|year=1985 |title=Competitive Advantage: Creating and Sustaining Superior Performance}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[core competency|Core competencies]] (also called core capabilities) are what give a company one or more competitive advantages in creating and delivering value to its customers in its chosen field, a cluster of extraordinary abilities or the [[excellence]] that a firm acquires from its founders, and which cannot be easily imitated.

Lee Perry, Randall Stott and Norm Smallwood&lt;ref&gt;Lee Perry, Randall Stott and Norm Smallwood ''Real Time Strategy'' (Wiley 1993)&lt;/ref&gt; added to the capabilities body of work the concepts of strategic options based on customer value proposition and business focus&lt;ref&gt;Benjamin B. Tregoe and John W. Zimmerman ''Top Management Strategy'' (Simon &amp; Schuster, 1980) Business Focus builds on the work of the "driving force" and "nine strategic areas" and how they suggest capabilities needed.&lt;/ref&gt; and types of work which characterized work as either:

* Unit of competitive advantage (UCA) – the work and capabilities that create distinctiveness for the business in the marketplace
* Value-added support work – the work and capabilities that facilitate the UCA
* Essential support work – the work that doesn't support UCA or facilitate it but must be done to operate the business

Building on earlier themes, the concept of [[dynamic capabilities]] was introduced in 2000. The basic assumption of the dynamic capabilities framework is that in fast changing markets, firms need to respond quickly and innovatively.

Around the same time, Richard Lynch, John Diezemann and James Dowling extended the concepts above in ''The Capable Company: Building the capabilities that make strategy work''.&lt;ref&gt;Richard Lynch, John Diezemann and James Dowling, ''The Capable Company: Building the capabilities that make strategy work'' (Wiley-Blackwell, 2003)&lt;/ref&gt; Key additions to the body of work were tools to translate strategic shifts to new sets of capabilities required whether these were core competencies or not. Building on the types of work ideas, the authors added performance target setting based on the capability value contribution. When compared to actual performance, the method outlined an approach to identify capability gaps and priorities. They also laid out a framework to continually align capabilities based on strategy shifts and external changes through the project agenda. The first full capability model was built by the authors in 2001 as the framework for the demerger of Intercontinental Hotels Group (then known as Six Continents) from the parent Six Continents PLC (formerly Bass &amp; Co Brewery).&lt;ref&gt;James Larson and Richard Lynch, "Reinventing a Hotel Company" (''BPM Connections'', October/November 2004)&lt;/ref&gt; The model included thee levels of capabilities, value contribution, performance targets, capability gaps, recommended actions and sourcing decisions.

In 2004, the [[UK Ministry of Defence]] released its [[enterprise architecture framework]], [[MODAF]]. This framework extended the existing [[DoDAF]] specification by adding views for capability planning. These views were standard ways to represent how the enterprise was expected to perform over time, expressed in terms of capabilities.

Other important contributions include the concept of value maps for detailing the customer proposition and more recently the profit proposition to identify capabilities that will help create [[Blue Ocean Strategy]]. Value maps extend the work of real-time strategy and the capable company by depicting a strategy canvas and providing an action framework to capture markets. In the mid-2000s, a team at Microsoft, in concert with Accelare, developed the motion methodology – a capability-based framework.&lt;ref&gt;Ric Merrifield, ''Rethink: What do you need to do today?'' (FT Press, 2009)&lt;/ref&gt; In 2008, Ric Merrifield, Jack Calhoun and Dennis Stevens, in "The Next Revolution in Productivity" added the use of SOA and its role in supporting capability delivery at breakthrough cost and speed.&lt;ref&gt;Ric Merrifield, Jack Calhoun and Dennis Stevens "The Next Revolution in Productivity", (''Harvard Business Review'', June, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;  Also introduced was the use of heats maps for capability analyses.

==Capability management frameworks==
A complete picture of the capabilities is the enterprise capability model.&lt;ref&gt;''Capability-Based Management'' (White Paper from Accelare, 2009)&lt;/ref&gt; It is a blueprint for the business expressed in terms of the capabilities necessary to execute strategy including delivery of services. Capabilities are described in levels of abstraction; usually three levels of details:

* Family of capabilities; often shown as [[chevron (insignia)|chevron]]s
* Groups of capabilities; illustrated in the health care provider diagram
* Specific capabilities; the level of detail to assess capabilities

At the higher level, are the attributes of ownership, location, and project road maps. The lower level is where the action is and where performance targets are set, performance assessed and gaps noted. It is at this level sourcing decisions are made or projects established to close gaps. The framework includes strategic, core and enabling capabilities.

* Strategic capabilities: capabilities in organizational planning, strategy, and investment
* Core capabilities: the inventory of business capabilities that are identified as delivering the products and services that an organization offers to its market.
*  Enabling capabilities: the inventory of business capabilities that are required to support them but not sold or offered to the market

===Strategic planning===
Companies like Harvard Pilgrim Health Care&lt;ref&gt;Jack Calhoun, Richard Lynch and Jim Dowling, "The Cost-Take-Out Challenge",  (www.accelare.com).&lt;/ref&gt; and Intercontinental Hotels Group&lt;ref&gt;James Larson and Richard Lynch, "Reinventing a Hotel Company"(October/November 2004 issue of ''BPM Connections'')&lt;/ref&gt; have used capabilities to focus on where to take out costs and outsource non strategic capabilities while improving service and adding brands.

===IT–business alignment===
Microsoft is using capability models to enter into conversations with clients to identify capability and process pain points to better align IT solutions to the business.[http://www.microsoft.com/applicationplatform/about/applicationplatformoptimization.mspx%20%20Microsoft%20APO%5D]

===New growth platforms===
Capabilities are also being used in new [[growth platforms|growth platform]] development.&lt;ref&gt;Donald L.  Laurie, Claude Sheer and Yves Doz, "New Growth Platforms" (''Harvard Business Review'', May 2006&lt;/ref&gt; Platforms are a foundation that spawns multiple products and/or services that, by themselves, are eventually the size of a business unit.&lt;ref&gt;Leander Kahney, "Straight Dope on the IPod's Birth" (''Wired'', October 17, 2006) illustrates this concept well.&lt;/ref&gt; These innovations result from identifying new domains created at the intersection of enablers or "unstoppable trends" and customer dynamics, linked to an essential set of core capabilities called the platform logic: those capabilities that are unique, valuable, and portable.

==Capability value contribution==
Building of the earlier type of work logic, Accelare added a distinction in assessment of the capabilities necessary to operative the business by examining the financial impact as well as the customer impact.&lt;ref&gt;Jack Calhoun, Richard Lynch and Jim Dowling, ''The Cost-Take-Out Challenge'', (Accelare, 2009).&lt;/ref&gt;

::::'''Figure 3: Capability value contribution to strategy'''
[[File:Capability Value Contribution.jpg]]

Some capabilities directly contribute to the customer value proposition and have a high impact on company financials. These "advantage capabilities" are shown in the upper right. Value contribution is assured when performance is among the best in peer organizations at acceptable cost. Keep them inside and protect the intellectual property. Moving to the top left quadrant, strategic support capabilities have high contribution in direct support of advantage capabilities. Keep them close. Value contribution is assured when performed above industry parity at competitive cost. Other capabilities shown in the bottom right are essential. They may not be visible to the customer but contribute to company's business focus and have a big impact on the bottom line.  Focus on efficiency improvement; especially in high volume work.  Value contribution is assured when performed at industry parity performance below competitors' cost. Other capabilities are "business necessity". Value contribution is assured when performed at industry parity performance below competitors' costs. They can be candidates for alternate sourcing.

==Gap analysis and heat maps==
A capability gap assessment can be portrayed in a [[heat map]].

* A heat map is a visualization of which capabilities required attention.
* A heat index is calculated using effectiveness and efficiency scores and the gap between targeted and actual performance; high heat (red/orange) in the gap column suggests investment.

Capability value contribution helps stack rank investments, for example advantage capabilities with high heat move to the top of the agenda, followed by business essential capabilities with large inefficiencies.

{{chemical engineering}}
A '''chemical plant''' is an [[industry|industrial]] [[Industrial process|process]] [[factory|plant]] that manufactures (or otherwise processes) [[chemical]]s, usually on a large scale.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Ellison-Taylor|publisher=Longmans|title=Chemical Plant Technology: An Introductory Manual|year=1970|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; The general objective of a chemical plant is to create new material wealth via the chemical or biological transformation and or separation of materials.&lt;ref name="Douglas" &gt;{{cite book | last = Douglas | first = James M. | title = Conceptual Design of Chemical Processes | publisher = McGraw-Hill | year = 1988 | isbn = 0-07-017762-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; Chemical plants use specialized equipment, units, and technology in the manufacturing process.  Other kinds of plants, such as polymer, pharmaceutical, food, and some beverage production facilities, [[power plant]]s, [[Oil refinery|oil refineries]] or other [[Oil refinery|refineries]], [[natural gas processing]] and biochemical plants, [[water]] and [[wastewater]] treatment, and [[pollution]] control equipment use many technologies that have similarities to chemical plant technology such as fluid systems and chemical reactor systems.  Some would consider an [[oil]] [[Oil refinery|refinery]] or a pharmaceutical or [[polymer]] [[manufacturer]] to be effectively a chemical plant.

[[Petrochemical]] plants (plants using chemicals from petroleum as a raw material or '' feedstock '') are usually located adjacent to an [[oil refinery]] to [[Optimization (mathematics)|minimize]] [[transport]]ation costs for the feedstocks produced by the refinery.  [[Speciality chemicals|Speciality chemical]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|publisher=Chemical &amp; Engineering News supplement 82|first=William|last=Stork|title=Speciality Chemicals|url=http://pubs.acs.org/supplements/chemchronicles2/pdf/035.pdf|pages=35–39|year=2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[fine chemical]] plants are usually much smaller and not as sensitive to location. Tools have been developed for converting a base project cost from one geographic location to another.&lt;ref&gt;[http://base.intratec.us/home/location-factor Plant Construction Location Factor - Intratec Knowledge Base] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140306053819/http://base.intratec.us/home/location-factor |date=6 March 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Chemical processes==
Chemical plants use [[chemical process]]es, which are detailed industrial-scale methods, to transform feedstock chemicals into products.  The same chemical process can be used at more than one chemical plant, with possibly differently scaled capacities at each plant.  Also, a chemical plant at a site may be constructed to utilize more than one chemical process, for instance to produce multiple products.

A chemical plant commonly has usually large vessels or sections called '''units''' or '''lines''' that are interconnected by [[piping]] or other material-moving equipment which can carry '''streams''' of material. Such material streams can include [[fluid]]s ([[gas]] or [[liquid]] carried in piping) or sometimes [[solid]]s or mixtures such as [[Slurry|slurries]]. An overall chemical process is commonly made up of steps called [[unit operation]]s which occur in the individual units.  A raw material going into a chemical process or plant as input to be converted into a product is commonly called a '''feedstock''', or simply '''feed'''. In addition to feedstocks for the plant as a whole, an input stream of material to be processed in a particular unit can similarly be considered feed for that unit. Output streams from the plant as a whole are final products and sometimes output streams from individual units may be considered intermediate products for their units. However, final products from one plant may be intermediate chemicals used as feedstock in another plant for further processing.  For example, some products from an oil refinery may used as feedstock in petrochemical plants, which may in turn produce feedstocks for pharmaceutical plants.

Either the feedstock(s), the product(s), or both may be individual [[Chemical compound|compounds]] or mixtures. It is often not worthwhile separating the components in these mixtures completely; specific levels of purity depend on product requirements and process economics.

===Operations===
Chemical processes may be run in [[Continuous production|continuous]] or [[Batch production|batch]] operation.
====Batch operation====
In '''batch''' operation, production occurs in time-sequential steps in discrete batches. A batch of feedstock(s) is fed (or '''charged''') into a process or unit, then the chemical process takes place, then the product(s) and any other outputs are removed. Such batch production may be repeated over again and again with new batches of feedstock. Batch operation is commonly used in smaller scale plants such as pharmaceutical or specialty chemicals production, for purposes of improved traceability as well as flexibility.
Continuous plants are usually used to manufacture [[Commodity chemicals|commodity]] or [[petrochemicals]] while batch plants are more common in [[Speciality chemicals|speciality]] and [[fine chemical]] production as well as [[Active_ingredient|pharmaceutical active ingredient]] (API) manufacture.

====Continuous operation====
In '''continuous''' operation, all steps are ongoing continuously in time. During usual continuous operation, the feeding and product removal are ongoing streams of moving material, which together with the process itself, all take place simultaneously and continuously.  Chemical plants or units in continuous operation are usually in a [[steady state]] or approximate steady state. Steady state means that quantities related to the process do not change as time passes during operation. Such constant quantities include stream [[Flow measurement|flow rate]]s, heating or cooling rates, [[temperature]]s, [[pressure]]s, and chemical compositions at any given point (location). Continuous operation is more efficient in many large scale operations like petroleum refineries. It is possible for some units to operate continuously and others be in batch operation in a chemical plant; for example, see [[Continuous distillation]] and [[Batch distillation]].  The amount of primary feedstock or product per unit of time which a plant or unit can process is referred to as the '''capacity''' of that plant or unit.  For examples: the capacity of an oil refinery may be given in terms of [[Barrel (unit)|barrels]] of [[crude oil]] refined per day; alternatively chemical plant capacity may be given in [[ton]]s of product produced per day.  In actual daily operation, a plant (or unit) will operate at a percentage of its full capacity. Engineers typically assume 90% operating time for plants which work primarily with fluids, and 80% uptime for plants which primarily work with solids.

==Units and fluid systems==
Specific [[unit operation]]s are conducted in specific kinds of units. Although some units may operate at ambient temperature or pressure, many units operate at higher or lower temperatures or pressures.  Vessels in chemical plants are often [[Cylinder (geometry)|cylindrical]] with rounded ends, a shape which can be suited to hold either high pressure or [[vacuum]]. [[Chemical reaction]]s can convert certain kinds of [[Chemical compound|compounds]] into other compounds in [[chemical reactor]]s.  Chemical reactors may be [[packed bed]]s and may have solid heterogeneous [[catalyst]]s which stay in the reactors as fluids move through, or may simply be stirred vessels in which reactions occur.  Since the surface of solid heterogeneous catalysts may sometimes become "poisoned" from deposits such as [[Coke (fuel)|coke]], regeneration of catalysts may be necessary.  [[Fluidized bed]]s may also be used in some cases to ensure good mixing. There can also be units (or subunits) for [[Mixing (process engineering)|mixing]] (including dissolving), [[Separation process|separation]], heating, cooling, or some combination of these.  For example, chemical reactors often have stirring for mixing and heating or cooling to maintain temperature.  When designing plants on a large scale, [[Heat of reaction|heat produced or absorbed by chemical reactions]] must be considered.  Some plants may have units with organism cultures for biochemical processes such as [[Industrial fermentation|fermentation]] or [[enzyme]] production.

[[File:Colonne distillazione.jpg|thumb|right|200px|[[Distillation]] unit in [[Italy]]]]
[[Separation processes]] include [[filtration]], [[settling]] (sedimentation), [[Liquid-liquid extraction|extraction]] or leaching, [[distillation]], [[recrystallization (chemistry)|recrystallization]] or [[Precipitation (chemistry)|precipitation]] (followed by filtration or settling), [[reverse osmosis]], [[drying]], and [[adsorption]].  [[Heat exchanger]]s are often used for heating or cooling, including [[boiling]] or [[condensation]], often in conjunction with other units such as distillation towers.  There may also be storage [[Chemical tank|tanks]] for storing feedstock, intermediate or final products, or waste.  Storage tanks commonly have level indicators to show how full they are.  There may be structures holding or supporting sometimes massive units and their associated equipment.  There are often stairs, ladders, or other steps for personnel to reach points in the units for sampling, inspection, or maintenance.  An area of a plant or facility with numerous storage tanks is sometimes called a ''[[Oil depot|tank farm]]'', especially at an [[oil depot]].

Fluid systems for carrying liquids and gases include piping and tubing of various diameter sizes, various types of [[valve]]s for controlling or stopping flow, [[pump]]s for moving or pressurizing liquid, and [[compressors]] for pressurizing or moving gases.  Vessels, piping, tubing, and sometimes other equipment at high or very low temperature are commonly covered with [[Thermal insulation|insulation]] for personnel safety and to maintain temperature inside.  Fluid systems and units commonly have [[instrumentation]] such as temperature and pressure sensors and [[Flow measurement|flow measuring]] devices at select locations in a plant.  Online [[analyzer]]s for chemical or physical property analysis have become more common.  [[Solvent]]s can sometimes be used to dissolve [[reactant]]s or materials such as solids for extraction or leaching, to provide a suitable medium for certain chemical reactions to run, or so they can otherwise be treated as fluids.

==Chemical plant design==
[[File:RefineryFlow.png|thumb|250px|right|Flow diagram for a typical [[oil refinery]]]]
Today, the fundamental aspects of [[design]]ing chemical plants are done by [[chemical engineer]]s. Historically, this was not always the case and many chemical plants were constructed in a haphazard way before the discipline of [[chemical engineering]] became established. Chemical engineering was first established as a profession in the United Kingdom when the first chemical engineering course was given at the University of Manchester in 1887 by [[George E. Davis]] in the form of twelve lectures covering various aspects of industrial chemical practice.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Delgass|publisher=Prudue University|title=Seventy Five Years of Chemical Engineering|url=https://engineering.purdue.edu/ChE/AboutUs/history.html|accessdate=13 August 2013|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a consequence [[George E. Davis]] is regarded as the World's first Chemical Engineer.Today Chemical Engineering is a profession and those Professional Chemical Engineers with experience can gain "Chartered" engineer status through the [[Institution of Chemical Engineers]].

In plant design, typically less than 1 per cent of ideas for new designs ever become commercialized.  During this solution process, typically, cost studies are used as an initial screening to eliminate unprofitable designs.  If a process appears profitable, then other factors are considered, such as safety, environmental constraints, controllability, etc.&lt;ref name="Douglas" /&gt;  The general goal in plant design, is to construct or synthesize “optimum designs” in the neighborhood of the desired constraints.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|publisher=Cambridge University Press|last=Cussler, Moggridge and Moggridge|title=Chemical product design|year=2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many times [[chemist]]s research chemical reactions or other chemical principles in a [[laboratory]], commonly on a small scale in a "batch-type" experiment.  Chemistry information obtained is then used by chemical engineers, along with expertise of their own, to convert to a chemical process and scale up the batch size or capacity.  Commonly, a small chemical plant called a [[pilot plant]] is built to provide design and operating information before construction of a large plant.  From data and operating experience obtained from the pilot plant, a scaled-up plant can be designed for higher or full capacity.  After the fundamental aspects of a plant design are determined, [[Mechanical engineer|mechanical]] or [[electrical engineer]]s may become involved with mechanical or electrical details, respectively.  [[Structural engineer]]s may become involved in the plant design to ensure the structures can support the [[weight]] of the units, piping, and other equipment.

The units, streams, and fluid systems of chemical plants or processes can be represented by [[Block diagram|block flow diagrams]] which are very simplified diagrams, or [[process flow diagram]]s which are somewhat more detailed.  The streams and other piping are shown as lines with arrow heads showing usual direction of material flow.  In block diagrams, units are often simply shown as blocks.  Process flow diagrams may use more detailed symbols and show pumps, compressors, and major valves.  Likely values or ranges of material flow rates for the various streams are determined based on desired plant capacity using material balance calculations.  Energy balances are also done based on [[Heat of reaction|heats of reaction]], [[Heat capacity|heat capacities]], expected temperatures and pressures at various points to calculate amounts of heating and cooling needed in various places and to size heat exchangers.  Chemical plant design can be shown in fuller detail in a [[piping and instrumentation diagram]] (P&amp;ID) which shows all piping, tubing, valves, and instrumentation, typically with special symbols.  Showing a full plant is often complicated in a P&amp;ID, so often only individual units or specific fluid systems are shown in a single P&amp;ID.

In the plant design, the units are sized for the maximum capacity each may have to handle.  Similarly, sizes for pipes, pumps, compressors, and associated equipment are chosen for the flow capacity they have to handle.  Utility systems such as [[electric power]] and [[water]] supply should also be included in the plant design.  Additional piping lines for non-routine or alternate operating procedures, such as plant or unit startups and shutdowns, may have to be included.  Fluid systems design commonly includes isolation valves around various units or parts of a plant so that a section of a plant could be isolated in case of a problem such as a [[leak]] in a unit.  If pneumatically or hydraulically actuated valves are used, a system of pressurizing lines to the actuators is needed.  Any points where process samples may have to be taken should have sampling lines, valves, and access to them included in the detailed design. If necessary, provisions should be made for reducing high pressure or temperature of a sampling stream, such including a [[pressure reducing valve]] or sample cooler.

Units and fluid systems in the plant including all vessels, piping, tubing, valves, pumps, compressors, and other equipment must be rated or designed to be able to withstand the entire range of pressures, temperatures, and other conditions which they could possibly encounter, including any appropriate [[safety factor]]s.  All such units and equipment should also be checked for [[compatibility (chemical)|materials compatibility]] to ensure they can withstand long-term exposure to the chemicals they will come in contact with.  Any closed system in a plant which has a means of pressurizing possibly beyond the rating of its equipment, such as heating, exothermic reactions, or certain pumps or compressors, should have an appropriately sized pressure [[relief valve]] included to prevent overpressurization for safety.  Frequently all of these parameters (temperatures, pressures, flow, etc.) are exhaustively analyzed in combination through a ''[[Hazop]]'' or ''[[Fault tree analysis#Fault tree analysis|fault tree analysis]]'', to ensure that the plant has no known risk of serious hazard.

Within any constraints the plant is subject to, design parameters are [[Process optimization|optimized]] for good economic performance while ensuring safety and welfare of personnel and the surrounding community.  For flexibility, a plant may be designed to operate in a range around some optimal design parameters in case feedstock or economic conditions change and re-optimization is desirable.  In more modern times, [[computer simulation]]s or other computer calculations have been used to help in chemical plant design or optimization.

==Plant operation==

===Process control===
In [[process control]], information gathered automatically from various sensors or other devices in the plant is used to control various equipment for running the plant, thereby controlling operation of the plant.  Instruments receiving such information signals and sending out control signals to perform this function automatically are process ''[[Controller (control theory)|controllers]]''.  Previously, [[pneumatic]] controls were sometimes used.  [[Electrical]] controls are now common.  A plant often has a [[control room]] with displays of parameters such as key temperatures, pressures, fluid flow rates and levels, operating positions of key valves, pumps and other equipment, etc.  In addition, operators in the control room can control various aspects of the plant operation, often including overriding automatic control.  Process control with a computer represents more modern technology.  Based on possible changing feedstock composition, changing products requirements or economics, or other changes in constraints, operating conditions may be re-optimized to maximize profit.

===Workers===
[[File:Paolo Monti - Servizio fotografico - BEIC 6355514.jpg|thumb|Workers in Italy, 1969. Photo by [[Paolo Monti]]]]
As in any industrial setting, there are a variety of workers working throughout a chemical plant facility, often organized into departments, sections, or other work groups.  Such workers typically include [[engineer]]s, [[plant operator]]s, and maintenance technicians.  Other personnel at the site could include chemists, management/administration and office workers.  Types of engineers involved in operations or maintenance may include chemical process engineers, mechanical engineers for maintaining mechanical equipment, and electrical/computer engineers for electrical or [[computer]] equipment.

===Transport===
Large quantities of fluid feedstock or product may enter or leave a plant by [[Pipeline transport|pipeline]], railroad [[tank car]], or [[tanker truck]].  For example, petroleum commonly comes to a refinery by pipeline.  Pipelines can also carry petrochemical feedstock from a refinery to a nearby petrochemical plant.  [[Natural gas]] is a product which comes all the way from a natural gas processing plant to final consumers by pipeline or tubing.  Large quantities of liquid feedstock are typically pumped into process units.  Smaller quantities of feedstock or product may be shipped to or from a plant in [[Drum (container)|drum]]s.  Use of drums about 55 gallons in capacity is common for [[packaging]] industrial quantities of chemicals.  Smaller batches of feedstock may be added from drums or other containers to process units by workers.

===Maintenance===
In addition to feeding and operating the plant, and packaging or preparing the product for shipping, plant workers are needed for taking samples for routine and troubleshooting analysis and for performing routine and non-routine maintenance.  [[Planned maintenance|Routine maintenance]] can include periodic inspections and replacement of worn catalyst, analyzer reagents, various sensors, or mechanical parts.  Non-routine maintenance can include investigating problems and then fixing them, such as leaks, failure to meet feed or product specifications, mechanical failures of valves, pumps, compressors, sensors, etc.

===Statutory and regulatory compliance===
When working with chemicals, [[safety]] is a concern in order to avoid problems such as [[chemical accident]]s.  In the [[United States]], the law requires that employers provide workers working with chemicals with access to a [[Material Safety Data Sheet]] (MSDS) for every kind of chemical they work with.  An MSDS for a certain chemical is prepared and provided by the supplier to whoever buys the chemical.  Other laws covering chemical safety, hazardous waste, and pollution must be observed, including statutes such as the [[Resource Conservation and Recovery Act]] (RCRA) and the [[Toxic Substances Control Act]] (TSCA), and regulations such as the [[Chemical Facility Anti-Terrorism Standards]] in the United States.  [[Dangerous goods|Hazmat]] (hazardous materials) teams are trained to deal with chemical leaks or spills.  [[Process Hazard Analysis]] (PHA) is used to assess potential [[hazard]]s in chemical plants.  In 1998, the [[U. S. Chemical Safety and Hazard Investigation Board]] has become operational.

==Plant facilities==
The actual production or process part of a plant may be indoors, outdoors, or a combination of the two. It may be a traditional stick-built plant or a [[Modular process skid|modular skid]]. Large modular skids are especially impressive feats of engineering. A modular skid is built including all of the modular equipment needed to do the same job a traditional stick-build plant may perform. However, the [http://modularprocess.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/Article-MovingToModular-ChE-01-2015.pdf modular skid is built within a structural steel frame], allowing it to be shipped to the onsite location without needing to be rebuilt onsite. A modular skid build results in a higher functioning end product, as less hands are required in the onsite setup of the modular skid process unit, resulting in minimized risk for mishaps. The actual production section of a facility usually has the appearance of a rather industrial environment.  Hard hats and work shoes are commonly worn.  Floors and stairs are often made of metal grating, and there is practically no decoration.  There may also be [[pollution control]] or [[waste treatment]] facilities or equipment.  Sometimes existing plants may be expanded or modified based on changing economics, feedstock, or product needs.  As in other production facilities, there may be [[shipping]] and receiving, and [[Warehouse|storage facilities]].  In addition, there are usually certain other facilities, typically indoors, to support production at the site.

Although some simple sample analysis may be able to be done by operations technicians in the plant area, a chemical plant typically has a [[laboratory]] where chemists analyze samples taken from the plant.  Such analysis can include [[chemical analysis]] or determination of physical properties.  Sample analysis can include routine [[quality control]] on feedstock coming into the plant, intermediate and final products to ensure quality [[specification]]s are met.  Non-routine samples may be taken and analyzed for investigating plant process problems also.  A larger [[chemical company]] often has a research laboratory for developing and testing products and processes where there may be pilot plants, but such a laboratory may be located at a site separate from the production plants.

A plant may also have a workshop or maintenance facility for repairs or keeping maintenance equipment.  There is also typically some office space for engineers, management or administration, and perhaps for receiving visitors.  The decorum there is commonly more typical of an office environment.

==Clustering of commodity chemical plants==
Chemical Plants used particularly for [[Commodity chemicals|commodity chemical]] and [[petrochemical]] manufacture, are located in relatively few manufacturing locations around the world largely due to infrastructural needs.This is less important for [[Speciality chemicals|speciality]] or [[fine chemical]] batch plants. Not all commodity/petrochemicals are produced in any one location but groups of related materials often are, to induce industrial symbiosis as well as material, energy and utility efficiency and other economies of scale. These manufacturing locations often have [[business cluster]]s of units called chemical plants that share utilities and large scale infrastructure such as power stations, port facilities, road and rail terminals. In the United Kingdom for example there are four main locations for commodity chemical manufacture: near the [[River Mersey]] in Northwest England, on the Humber on the East coast of Yorkshire, in Grangemouth near the Firth of Forth in Scotland and on [[Teesside]] as part of the [[Northeast of England Process Industry Cluster]] (NEPIC).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=UK Trade&amp;Investment |title=Chemicals–the UK advantage |url=http://www.cia.org.uk/Portals/0/downloads_pdf_1_Chemicals-Brochure-FINAL-JAN-09.pdf |page=9-10 |accessdate=10 July 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131029190310/http://www.cia.org.uk/Portals/0/downloads_pdf_1_Chemicals-Brochure-FINAL-JAN-09.pdf |archivedate=29 October 2013 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Approximately 50% of the UK's petrochemicals, which are also commodity chemicals, are produced by the industry cluster companies on [[Teesside]] at the mouth of the [[River Tees]] on three large chemical parks at [[Wilton, Redcar and Cleveland|Wilton]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Colin|last=Hurworth|publisher=Falcon Press| title=Wilton the First Fifty Years|isbn=1872339018|year=1999}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Billingham]] and [[Seal Sands]].

==Corrosion and use of new materials==
[[Corrosion]] in chemical process plants is a major issue that consumes billions of dollars yearly. Electrochemical corrosion of metals is pronounced in chemical process plants due to the presence of acid fumes and other electrolytic interactions. Recently, FRP ([[Fibre-reinforced plastic]]) is used as a material of construction.  The British standard specification [[BS4994]] is widely used for design and construction of the vessels, tanks, etc.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5431">{{distinguish|Chief Scientific Adviser (disambiguation){{!}}Chief Scientific Adviser}}
A '''chief science officer''' ('''C.S.O.''') is a position at the head of scientific research operations at organizations or companies performing significant scientific research projects.

==Description==
A C.S.O. typically is responsible for envisioning and developing research capabilities (human, methodological, and technological), for developing evidence of the validity and utility of research products, and for communicating with the scientific and customer communities concerning capabilities and scientific product offerings. 

In some organizations, the same person may hold this title along with that of [[chief technology officer]] (C.T.O.). Alternatively, a company could have one or the other, or both occupied by separate people. Often, C.S.Os exists in heavily research-oriented companies, while C.T.Os exists in [[product development]] focused companies. The typical category of [[research and development]] that exists in many science and technology companies can be led by either post, depending upon which area is the organization's primary focus. 

A C.S.O. almost always has a pure science background and an advanced degree, whereas a C.T.O. often has a background in engineering or business development.

Some academic research organizations, such as the [[Fox Chase Cancer Center]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Fox Chase Cancer Center News {{!}} Fox Chase Cancer Center - Philadelphia, PA|url=http://www.fccc.edu/news/2008/2008-07-28-Jeff-Boyd.html|website=www.fccc.edu|accessdate=1 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Dana-Farber Cancer Institute]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Research - Dana-Farber Cancer Institute {{!}} Boston, MA|url=http://www.dana-farber.org/res/scientificreport/message-from-chief-scientific-officer.html|website=www.dana-farber.org|accessdate=1 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[San Diego Supercomputer Center]] have adopted a similar title of C.S.O.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Michael L. Norman Appointed Chief Scientific Officer of SDSC|url=http://ucsdnews.ucsd.edu/newsrel/supercomputer/06-08MichealNorman.asp|website=ucsdnews.ucsd.edu|accessdate=1 February 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Typically, their role is to evaluate and set scientific priorities and coordinate the administrative structure that supports scientists. A C.S.O. commonly has a scientific or academic background, yet they may or may not be practicing scientists or academics.

==England==

In the [[National Health Service (England)|National Health Service]], the C.S.O. is the head of profession for the 53,000 [[Healthcare science|healthcare scientists]] working in the organization and its associated bodies. The C.S.O. is one of six NHS professional officers (including the [[Chief Medical Officer (United Kingdom)|chief medical officer]] and the [[Chief Nursing Officer|chief nursing officer]]) who are employed within [[NHS England]]. These roles lead their own professional groups as well as providing expert knowledge about their specific disciplines to the NHS and wider health and care system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.england.nhs.uk/appointments/ |title=Appointments |publisher=NHS England |accessdate=17 April 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130411073747/http://www.england.nhs.uk/appointments/ |archivedate=11 April 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The C.S.O. provides professional leadership and expert clinical advice across the health system, as well as working alongside senior clinical leaders within NHS England and the broader commissioning system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cso.dh.gov.uk/2013/02/11/nhs-commissioning-board-appoints-its-first-chief-scientific-officer/ |title=NHS Commissioning Board appoints its first Chief Scientific Officer |publisher=Department of Health |date = 11 February 2013 |accessdate=17 April 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The C.S.O. is also responsibility for delivering the government's strategy for a modernised healthcare science workforce, [[Modernising Scientific Careers]].

[[Professor Sue Hill|Professor Dame Sue Hill]] has been the C.S.O. since October 2002 first within the [[Department of Health (United Kingdom)|department of health]] and subsequently NHS England .&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dh.gov.uk/en/Aboutus/Chiefprofessionalofficers/Chiefscientificofficer/DH_63 |title=Chief Scientific Officer |publisher=Department of Health |accessdate=13 March 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The role was strengthened in March 2013, with the appointment of a deputy C.S.O.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://cso.dh.gov.uk/2013/03/25/dr-fiona-carragher-appointed-deputy-chief-scientific-officer-by-nhs-commissioning-board/ |title=Fiona Carragher appointed Deputy Chief Scientific Officer by NHS Commissioning Board |publisher=Department of Health |date=25 March 2013 |accessdate=13 January 2014 |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20130123162412/http://cso.dh.gov.uk/2013/03/25/dr-fiona-carragher-appointed-deputy-chief-scientific-officer-by-nhs-commissioning-board/ |archivedate=23 January 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2985">'''Chris Badami''' is an American musician, music producer and sound engineer.

A New Jersey native, Badami began this musical journey by teaching himself the basics of recording on a four-track cassette recorder he received as a birthday gift.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=biography|url=http://www.chrisbadami.com/bio-2/|accessdate=28 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Badami has recorded and produced hundreds of acts since the early 1990s. Chris got his start in the music industry as an active player and studio musician in the [[New York (state)|New York]]/[[New Jersey]] area. While performing in recording studios, his love of technology began. From there, Chris began working at top recording studios in the area and completed two college degrees in percussion and music technology from [[NYU]] (A.S. &amp; B.M.).

The ability to relate to musicians in a recording environment is what led Chris to start [[Portrait Recording Studios]]. In 1995 Chris started [[Portrait Recording Studios]] with the idea of relating to musicians not only on a technical level, but also a musical level. Chris expanded on the idea by creating a relaxing, comfortable, and "State of the Art" environment for musicians worldwide.

Chris' engineering and production credits span the globe on both a major and independent level, working with artists and labels such as: Days of the New, [[The Early November]], [[I Can Make A Mess Like Nobody's Business]], [[Luthea Salom]], [[The Starting Line]], [[The Dillinger Escape Plan]], [[Hidden in Plain View]], [[Roses Are Red (band)|Roses Are Red]], Stafford, [[Socratic (band)|Socratic]], [[Midtown (band)|Midtown]], Mike Patton, Burlap to Cashmere, Lenny White ([[Miles Davis]], [[Stanley Clarke]], [[Chick Corea]]), Mary Wilson of [[The Supremes]], [[John Popper]] of [[Blues Traveler]], [[Roark (musician)|Roark]], [[Jodelle (entertainer)]], [[OneTwoThreeFour]], [[Pete Nischt]], [[Geffen Records]], A&amp;M Records, [[Interscope Records]], [[Drive-Thru Records]], [[Victory Records]], Trustkill Records, Relapse Records, and [[Regular Music]].

On a musical level, Chris has recently been published in Modern Drummer Magazine and continues to perform and record regularly throughout the nation with [[I Can Make A Mess Like Nobody's Business]], [[Roark (musician)|Roark]] and The Jon Klein Combine.

A '''custodian bank''', or simply '''custodian''', is a specialized [[financial institution]] responsible for safeguarding a firm's or individual's financial assets and is not engaged in "traditional" commercial or consumer/retail banking such as mortgage or personal lending, [[branch banking]], personal accounts, [[Automated Teller Machine]]s (ATMs) and so forth. The role of a custodian in such a case would be to:
*hold in safekeeping assets/securities such as [[equities|stocks]], [[Bond (finance)|bonds]], [[commodities]] such as [[precious metals]] and [[currency]] (cash), domestic and foreign
*arrange [[Settlement (finance)|settlement]] of any purchases and sales and deliveries in/out of such securities and currency
*collect information on and income from such assets ([[dividend]]s in the case of stocks/equities and [[Coupon (bond)|coupon]]s (interest payments) in the case of bonds) and administer related [[tax withholding]] documents and foreign tax reclamation
*administer voluntary and involuntary [[corporate action]]s on securities held such as stock dividends, [[stock split]]s, business combinations ([[mergers]]), [[tender offers]], [[Callable bond|bond calls]], etc.
*provide information on the securities and their issuers such as annual general meetings and related proxies
*maintain currency/cash bank accounts, effect deposits and withdrawals and manage other cash transactions
*perform [[Foreign exchange market|foreign exchange]] transactions
*often perform additional services for particular clients such as mutual funds; examples include [[fund accounting]], administration, legal, compliance and tax support services

Using US definitions, a person who owns [[street name securities]] and who is not a member of an [[stock exchange|exchange]], holds the securities through a registration chain which involves one or more custodians. This is due to the perceived impracticality of registering traded securities in the name of each individual holder; instead, the custodian or custodians are registered as the holders and hold the securities in a [[fiduciary law|fiduciary]] arrangement for the ultimate security holders. However, the ultimate security holders are still the legal owners of the securities. They are not merely beneficiaries of the custodian as a trustee. The custodian does not become at any point the owner of the securities, but is only a part of the registration chain linking the owners to the securities.
Global securities safekeeping practices vary substantially with markets such as the UK, Australia and South Africa encouraging designated [[securities account]]s in order to permit shareholder identification by companies.

The definition of "shareholder" is generally upheld by [[corporate law]] rather than securities law. One role of custodians (which may or may not be enforced by securities regulation) is to facilitate the exercise of share ownership rights, for example and processing [[dividend]]s and other payments, corporate actions, the proceeds of a [[stock split]] or a [[reverse stock split]], the ability to vote in the company's [[annual general meeting]] (AGM), information and reports sent from the company and so forth. The extent to which such services are offered are a function of the client agreement together with relevant market rules, regulations and laws.

Custodian banks are often referred to as '''global custodians''' if they safe keep assets for their clients in multiple jurisdictions around the world, using their own local branches or other local custodian banks ("sub-custodian" or "agent banks") with which they contract to be in their "global network" in each market to hold accounts for their respective clients. Assets held in such a manner are typically owned by larger institutional firms with a considerable number of investments such as [[bank]]s, [[insurance companies]], [[mutual funds]], [[hedge fund]]s and [[pension fund]]s.

As of 2018 the 4 largest custodian banks in the world were:&lt;ref name=Forbes1&gt;{{cite magazine

==Depository Instruments==
In relation to [[American depositary receipt]]s (ADRs), a '''local custodian bank''' (also known as a sub-custodian or agent bank) is a bank in a country outside the United States that holds the corresponding number of shares of stock trading on the home [[stock market]] represented by an ADR trading in the USA, with each multiple representing some multiple of the underlying foreign share. This multiple allows the ADRs to possess a price per share conventional for the US market (typically between $20 and $50 per share) even if the price of the foreign share is unconventional when converted to US dollars directly. This bank acts as custodian bank for the company that issues the ADRs in the US stock.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.sec.gov/investor/alerts/adr-bulletin.pdf|title=SEC Investor Bulletin: American Depository Receipts|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=SEC Office of Investor Education and Advocacy|access-date=|accessdate=2012-08-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Self-Directed Retirement Account Custodians (US)==
According to the [[Internal Revenue Code]] (IRC) in the US, various retirement accounts such as: [[Individual retirement account|Traditional IRA]]s, [[Roth IRA]], SEP IRA, or 401k plan accounts require that a qualified trustee, or custodian, hold IRA assets on behalf of the IRA owner. The trustee/custodian provides custody of the assets, processes all transactions, maintains other records pertaining to them, files the required IRS reports, issues client statements, helps clients understand the rules and regulations pertaining to certain prohibited transactions, and performs other administrative duties on behalf of the self-directed retirement account owner.

Self-directed retirement account custodians (also known as "self-directed IRA custodians" or "self-directed 401k custodians") should not be confused with a custodian bank, which strictly provides safekeeping for securities. While a self-directed retirement account custodian can provide custody for securities, typically it will specialize in non-security assets, or [[alternative investments]]. Examples of alternative investments would be: [[Real Estate]], [[precious metals]], private mortgages, private company stock, oil and gas LPs, horses, and intellectual property. These types of assets require a specialization on the part of the custodian due to the complexity of the documentation required to keep the alternative investments in compliance with the IRC.

==Mutual Fund Custodian==
A Mutual Fund Custodian refers typically to a custodian bank or trust company (a special type of financial institution regulated like a "bank"), or similar financial institution responsible for holding and safeguarding the securities owned by a mutual fund. A mutual fund's custodian may also act as one or more service agents for the mutual fund such as being the [[fund accounting|fund accountant]], administrator and/or [[transfer agent]] which maintains shareholder records and disburses periodic dividends or capital gains, if any, distributed by the fund. The vast majority of funds use a third party custodian as required by [[U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission|SEC]] regulation to avoid complex rules and requirements about ''self-custody''.

A mutual fund retirement account (IRA, SEP etc.) custodian, however, refers to the plan administrator and recordkeeper such as noted above, which may not necessarily be the same institution providing custody services to the investments of the overall fund.

The '''Durbin amendment''' is a provision of United States federal law, {{USC|15|1693o-2}}, that requires the [[Federal Reserve]] to limit fees charged to retailers for [[debit card]] processing. It was passed as part of the [[Dodd-Frank]] financial reform legislation in 2010, as a last-minute addition by Illinois Senator [[Dick Durbin|Richard Durbin]], after whom the amendment is named.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Chen|first1=Tim|title=What the Durbin Amendment Means for You|url=http://money.usnews.com/money/blogs/my-money/2011/07/12/what-the-durbin-amendment-means-for-you|accessdate=9 April 2015|agency=U.S News}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

After the rule to limit fees, [[Title 12 of the Code of Federal Regulations|12 C.F.R.]]  §235, went into effect, a coalition of merchants sued the Federal Reserve. The rule was upheld when the Supreme Court denied petition for [[certiorari]] in 2014.

==Background==
[[Interchange fees]] are paid to banks by acquirers for the privilege of accepting [[payment cards]]. Merchants and card-issuing banks have long fought over these fees. Prior to the Durbin amendment, card swipe fees were previously unregulated and averaged about 44 cents per transaction.&lt;ref&gt;Gordon, Marcy. [https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/business/2013/07/31/judge-strikes-cap-debit-swipe-fees/2603299/ "Judge strikes Fed's cap on debit 'swipe' fees"], ''[[USA Today]]'', Washington, 31 July 2013. Retrieved on 5 March 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

Merchants lobbied heavily for a rule to limit debit card swipe fees.&lt;ref&gt;Mattingly, Phil. [https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2011-06-28/how-wal-mart-swiped-jpmorgan-in-16-billion-debit-card-battle "How Wal-Mart Swiped JPMorgan in $16 Billion Debit-Card Battle"], ''[[Bloomberg News]]'', 27 June 2011. Retrieved on 5 March 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; They accomplished this when the Durbin amendment passed with the Dodd-Frank financial reform legislation on July 21, 2010.&lt;ref&gt;Chen, Tim. [http://money.usnews.com/money/blogs/my-money/2011/07/12/what-the-durbin-amendment-means-for-you "What the Durbin Amendment Means for You"], ''[[U.S. News &amp; World Report]]'', 12 July 2011. Retrieved on 5 March 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; This was considered a major loss for banks, who receive billions of dollars a year in income from swipe fees.&lt;ref&gt;Mui, Yan Q..

The law applies to banks with over $10 billion in assets, and these banks would have to charge debit card interchange fees that are "reasonable and proportional to the actual cost" &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nerdwallet.com/blog/2011/durbin-amendment-explained|title=The Durbin Amendment Explained|publisher=NerdWallet.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; of processing the transaction. The bill aimed to restrict anti-competitive practices and encourage competition, and included provisions which allow retailers to refuse to use [[credit cards]] for small purchases and offer incentives for using cash or another type of card.&lt;ref name="BillComparison"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pewfr.org/reform_resources_detail?id=0877|title=Side-by-Side Comparison Chart – Key Senate and House Bill Issues|publisher=Davis Polk &amp; Wardwell|work=Pew Financial Reform Project}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Durbin amendment also gave the Federal Reserve the power to regulate debit card interchange fees, and on December 16, 2010, the Fed proposed a maximum interchange fee of 12 cents per debit card transaction,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/press/bcreg/20101216a.htm|title=Press Release on Debit Card Interchange Fees and Routing; Proposed Rule|publisher=[[Federal Reserve]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; which [[CardHub.com]] estimated would cost large banks $14 billion annually.&lt;ref name="interchange-study"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://education.cardhub.com/interchange-fee-study-2010/|title=Interchange Study|publisher=CardHub.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; On June 29, 2011, the Fed issued its final rule, which holds that the maximum interchange fee an issuer can receive from a single debit card transaction is 21 cents plus 5 [[basis points]] multiplied by the amount of the transaction.&lt;ref name="final-fed-rule"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/press/bcreg/20110629a.htm|title=FRB: Press Release|publisher=Federal Reserve}}&lt;/ref&gt; This rule also allows issuers to raise their interchange fees by as much as one cent if they implement certain fraud-prevention measures.&lt;ref name="final-fed-rule" /&gt;  An issuer eligible for this adjustment, could therefore receive an interchange fee of as much as 24 cents for the average debit card transaction (valued at $38),&lt;ref name="final-fed-rule" /&gt; according to the Federal Reserve. This cap—which took effect on October 1, 2011, rather than July 21, 2011, as was previously announced—will reduce fees roughly $9.4 billion annually, according to [[CardHub.com]].&lt;ref name="interchange-study" /&gt; As a result of the government limiting their revenue from interchange fees, banks made plans to raise account maintenance fees to compensate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.timesonline.com/news/local_news/new-fees-for-banks-likely-to-mean-new-fees-from/article_9d295744-af8f-5eea-bbe1-a33ac5200f52.html|title=New fees for banks likely to mean new fees from banks – Timesonline.com: Local News|date=2011-10-03|publisher=Timesonline.com|accessdate=2012-03-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Federal Reserve Rule===
The rule that the Federal Reserve issued went into effect on October 1, 2011 and capped the interchange rate paid to non-exempt card issuers at 0.05 percent plus twenty-one cents.  The rule also allowed these non-exempt card issuers to earn an additional one-cent fraud prevention adjustment for implementation of fraud prevention policies.&lt;ref&gt;Federal Reserve Board Press Release [http://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/press/bcreg/20110629a.htm], ''[[Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System]]'', 29 June 2011. Retrieved on 5 March 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Response to the rule===
Merchants and card-issuing banks opposed the Federal Reserve rule.

The Merchant Payments Coalition (MPC) argued that this rule was unfair as the Durbin amendment required the Federal Reserve to ensure that banks take effective steps against fraud and determine how much of the cost banks should bear themselves. The MPC said that banks should actually have to reduce fraud before receiving more funds. The MPC pointed out that the common practice of having customers merely signing for debit card purchases processed through the Visa and MasterCard payment networks instead of requiring a PIN greatly increases fraud.&lt;ref&gt;Flagg, Michael. [http://www.unfaircreditcardfees.com/site/press/the_new_federal_reserve_rule_will_enrich_banks_for_not_preventing_frau "The New Federal Reserve Rule Will Enrich Banks for Not Preventing Fraud, Says the Merchants Payments Coalition"], ''Merchant Payments Coalition'', 27 July 2012. Retrieved on 5 March 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[American Bankers Association]] opposed the rule because it represents an “unprecedented transfer in costs from retailers to consumers – the result of government price fixing" leading to "consumers paying higher fees for basic bank services.”&lt;ref&gt;Touryalai, Halah. [https://www.forbes.com/sites/halahtouryalai/2011/10/13/new-bill-could-kill-durbins-debit-card-fees/ "New Bill Aims To Kill Durbin's Debit Card Fees"], ''[[Forbes]]'', 13 October 2011. Retrieved on 5 March 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Litigation against the rule==
A coalition of merchants including the [[National Association of Convenience Stores]] (NACS) and [[National Restaurant Association]] sued the Federal Reserve and argued the rule exceeded the authority granted by Congress.&lt;ref&gt;Needham, Vicki. [http://thehill.com/policy/finance/215454-business-groups-ask-supreme-court-to-review-swipe-fee-decision "Business groups ask Supreme Court to review swipe fee decision"], ''[[The Hill (newspaper)|The Hill]]'', 18 August 2014. Retrieved on 5 March 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

===District court===
In July 2013, U.S. District Judge Richard Leon ruled that the Federal Reserve did not comply with the Durbin amendment when crafting a rule to limit debit card swipe fees. Judge Leon ordered the Federal Reserve to re-write its rule governing the cap on debit card swipe fees and implement a temporary regulation as well.&lt;ref name=DistrictCourt&gt;{{Cite court |litigants=NACS v. Bd. of Governors of the Fed. Reserve Sys. |vol=958 |reporter=F. Supp 2d |opinion=85 |pinpoint=103 |court=D.D.C. |date=2013 |url=https://nrf.com/sites/default/files/Documents/Decision_3.pdf |accessdate=5 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The opinion was generally scathing and noted that the agency overruled its own staff, who had recommended a cap of 12 cents per transaction.&lt;ref&gt;Douglas, Danielle. [https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/economy/court-reverses-ruling-on-swipe-fees-in-favor-of-banks/2014/03/21/55304440-b105-11e3-95e8-39bef8e9a48b_story.html "Court reverses ruling on swipe fees in favor of banks"], ''[[The Washington Post]]'', 21 March 2014. Retrieved on 5 March 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; Judge Leon held the Federal Reserve Board "clearly disregarded Congress' statutory intent by inappropriately inflating all debit-card transaction fees by billions of dollars." The judge also ruled that the Federal Reserve failed to ensure that merchants enjoy access to "multiple unaffiliated networks" to process each debit-card transaction, as also required by the Durbin amendment.&lt;ref&gt;Reckard, E. Scott. [https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/economy/court-reverses-ruling-on-swipe-fees-in-favor-of-banks/2014/03/21/55304440-b105-11e3-95e8-39bef8e9a48b_story.html "Judge rejects Fed's cap on debit-card fees as too easy on banks"], ''[[The Los Angeles Times]]'', 31 July 2013. Retrieved on 5 March 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Court of Appeals===
The D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals reversed and held the Federal Reserve reasonably interpreted Congress' intent of the Durbin amendment through its 2011 rule limiting swipe fees. “Given that the Board’s rule advances the Durbin amendment’s purpose, we decline to second-guess its reasoned decision to reject an alternative option that might have further advanced the purpose.”&lt;ref name=COA&gt;{{Cite court |litigants=NACS v. Bd. of Governors of the Fed. Reserve Sys. |vol=746 |reporter=F.3d |opinion=474 |pinpoint=495 |court=D.C. Cir. |date=2014 |url=https://www.wsj.com/public/resources/documents/InterchangeFees03212014.pdf |accessdate=5 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The three judge panel noted that “Congress put the Board, the district court and us in a real bind...given that the Durbin amendment was crafted in conference committee at the eleventh hour, its language is confusing and its structure convoluted.”&lt;ref&gt;Schmidt, Robert. [https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2014-03-21/durbin-chided-by-judges-says-swipe-fee-ruling-is-bank-giveaway- "Durbin Chided by Judges Says Swipe-Fee Ruling Is Bank ‘Giveaway’"], ''[[Bloomberg News]]'', 21 March 2014. Retrieved on 5 March 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Supreme Court===
On August 18, 2014, NACS filed a petition for certiorari. On January 20, 2015, the Supreme Court denied NACS petition for certiorari. The decision upholds the Federal Reserve rule on the interchange rate paid to non-exempt card issuers at 0.05 percent plus twenty-one cents.&lt;ref&gt;Hurley, Lawrence. Stephenson, Emily. [https://www.reuters.com/article/2015/01/20/us-usa-court-debitcards-idUSKBN0KT1LA20150120 "Supreme Court rejects challenge to debit card 'swipe fees' rules"], ''[[Reuters]]'', 20 January 2015.

An '''executive director''' is a [[chief executive officer]] (CEO) or [[managing director]] of an [[organization]], [[company (law)|company]], or [[corporation]]. The title is widely used in [[North America]]n [[non-profit organization]]s, though many [[United States]] nonprofits have adopted the title [[president (corporate title)|president]] or CEO.&lt;ref&gt;''Policy vs. Paper Clips: Selling the Corporate Model to Your Nonprofit Board'', Eugene H. Fram with Vicki Brown, 1995, 2nd Edition, Families International, Milwaukee, WI&lt;/ref&gt;

Confusion can arise because the words ''executive'' and ''director'' occur both in this title and in titles of various members of some organizations' boards of directors. The precise meanings of these terms are discussed in the [[board of directors]] article.

==Role==
The role of the executive director is to design, develop and implement strategic plans for the organization in a manner that is both cost and time-efficient. The executive director is also responsible for the day-to-day operation of the organization, which includes managing committees and staff as well as developing business plans in collaboration with the board. In essence, the board grants the executive director the authority to run the organization.{{Fact|date=November 2012}} The executive director is accountable to the chairman of the board of directors and reports to the board on a regular basis – quarterly, semiannually, or annually. The board may offer suggestions and ideas about how to improve the organization, but the executive director decides whether or not, and how, to implement these ideas.

The executive director is a [[leadership]] role for an organization and often fulfills a [[motivation]]al role in addition to office-based work. Executive directors motivate and mentor members, volunteers, and staff, and may chair meetings. The executive director leads the organization and develops its [[organizational culture]].&lt;ref&gt;Charles W. L. Hill, and Gareth R. Jones, (2001) ''Strategic Management''. Houghton Mifflin.&lt;/ref&gt;

As the title suggests, the executive director needs to be informed of everything that goes on in the organization.{{Fact|date=August 2015}} This includes staff, membership, budget, company assets, and all other company resources, to help make the best use of them and raise the organization's profitability and profile.

The '''Green Car Vision Award''' is an annual award granted by the ''[[Green Car Journal]]''. In contrast with its [[Green Car of the Year]] award, which only considers [[production vehicle]]s that make the most significant environmental advancements, the Green Car Vision Award considers [[pre-production vehicle]]s with more than one functional [[concept car|prototype]] in existence and that may be in the early stages of commercialization. Vehicles that are part of a demonstration fleet or other program that finds them regularly driven by people other than employees of their manufacturer may also be considered. Nominees may also include a modification of an existing vehicle model, such as a conversion to another type of power like electric drive.&lt;ref name=GCJ2008/&gt;

The '''Hamburg University of Technology''' (in [[German language|German]] '''Technische Universität Hamburg''', abbreviated '''TUHH''') is one of the youngest universities in [[Germany]] as well as among those which have achieved popularity in a short time.

The university was founded in 1978 and in 1982/83 lecturing followed. Around 100 senior lecturers/professors and 1,150 members of staff (450 scientists, including externally funded researchers) work at the TUHH. With an average of 5,000 students the TUHH offers a high ratio of staff to students.

It is located in [[Harburg, Hamburg|Harburg]], a district in the south of [[Hamburg]].

==Interdisciplinary Studies==
[[File:TUHH, Hamburg, Germany3.jpg|thumb|TU Hamburg Campus]]
[[File:Blick über den TUHH Campus.jpg|thumb|Inside view of the TUHH Campus]]
Instead of traditional faculties, the TUHH has separate administrations for teaching and for research: research is conducted in departments, teaching is divided into schools of study. Scientists from different subjects work together in the departments. Curricula are organized by academic speciality, depending on the course of study followed.

In the year 2000, the TUHH defined the following strategic topics of research activities:

# Information as economic value
# Organization for enterprises
# Production and process integrated environmental protection
# Sustainable management of resources
# Advanced energy systems and energy management
# Sustainable urban structures
# Systems of transport and logistic
# Advanced information and communication technologies
# Advanced materials and microsystems
# Biotechnologies and biomedical engineering

Research is divided into six interdisciplinary research departments:

# Town, Environment, Technology
# Systems Engineering
# Civil Engineering and Marine Technology
# Information and Communication Technology
# Materials, Design, Manufacturing
# Processing Technology and Energy Systems

Teaching is organized in six schools of study:
# Civil Engineering
# Electrical Engineering, Computer Science and Mathematics
# Vocational Subject Education
# Management Science and Technology
# Mechanical Engineering
# Process and Chemical Engineering

==Northern Institute of Technology ==
{{main|Northern Institute of Technology}}
[[File:NIT, Gebäude F der TUHH.jpg|thumb|NIT]]
The Northern Institute of Technology (NIT) is a private business school, located in Hamburg, Germany. It was founded in 1998 as a public-private partnership of the Hamburg University of Technology and sponsoring companies. Students graduate with an MBA or Master of Technology Management (MTM) degree after completion of this course.

NIT offers a 2-year double-degree program: Students study a Master of Science in an engineering program of their choice at TUHH and concurrently are taking part in the MBA/MTM program at the NIT. The idea is to equip engineers not only with technical knowledge but at the same time provide a practical education for leading positions in industry. Besides the classical management disciplines, the MBA program includes an intensive training in various soft skills, law and a foreign language (usually German). All classes are held in English language. The faculty consists of distinguished professors and industry experts from various universities and companies across the world.

==Innovation==

TUHH founded the TUHH Technologie GmbH (TuTech). Since 1992 the TuTech has been responsible for technology transfer and advice, for trade fairs and further training, as well as congresses and the initiation of projects. Examples are the "Starterzentrum", the local initiation "hep", the "Gründerrat" of the TUHH as well as a course of studies for carriermanagement. Young entrepreneurs are accompanied and advised on setting up their own business. In 1994 the TUHH became the pioneer German university in the creation of modular courses and introduced a course with a bachelor's degree in General Engineering Science. Since 1997 nine master's degree courses and a bachelor's degree course have been added.

==University Library==
[[File:TUB TUHH.jpg|thumb|TUB]]
The library is not only used internally but as a specialized technical library of the Hamburg region. Its services are also available to citizens who are not students.

In addition to the basic service of providing printed media on loan or for use within the TUB HH, the library also procures documents from cooperation partners such as libraries, specialized information centres and publishers.

'''Hushang Ansary''' ({{lang-fa|هوشنگ انصاری}}, born 1 January 1926) is an [[Iranian-American]] former diplomat, businessman, and philanthropist. He served for eighteen years in the Iranian government prior to the [[Iranian Revolution]] including as [[Ministry of Economic Affairs and Finance (Iran)|Minister of Economic Affairs and Finance]] and Iran's Ambassador to the United States from 1967-1969.&lt;ref name="A Thousand Years of the Persian Book Exhibition Opens at Library of Congress March 27" /&gt; He has been chairman or director of companies both in Iran and in the United States.

==Political career==
Born in [[Ahvaz]], in Iran's [[Khuzestan Province]], Ansary first worked as a newspaper and magazine photographer in Ahvaz, [[Tehran]], and England before moving to Japan in 1954. There he met [[Abbas Aram]], Iran's ambassador to Japan, who soon brought him to the attention of [[Mohammad Reza Pahlavi|Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi]]. The Shah asked Ansary to return to Iran and appointed him to several government positions starting in 1961, including [[Ministry of Commerce (Iran)|Undersecretary of Commerce]], ambassador to many African nations and to Pakistan, and [[Ministry of Information and Communications Technology (Iran)|Minister of Information]].&lt;ref&gt;Milani, p. 80.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1964, he married Maryam Panahi, a friend of ambassador Aram who had many high-ranking acquaintances in the governments of the United States and Iran.&lt;ref name="eminent persians"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Milani|first1=Abbas|title=Eminent Persians : the men and women who made modern Iran, 1941-1979 : in two volumes|date=2008|publisher=Syracuse University Press|location=Syracuse, N.Y.|isbn=9780815609070|pages=80–84|edition=1st|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ixU33FaG_dgC&amp;pg=PA79&amp;lpg=PA79&amp;dq=ANSARY+HUSHANG+iran&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=dTf1E7b-kt&amp;sig=gHXrgpk1Szv7d6Fx3YkChqt0oyM&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=p7dPVenWFsGEsQXCyoDQBQ&amp;ved=0CFMQ6AEwCw#v=onepage&amp;q=ANSARY%20HUSHANG%20iran&amp;f=false|accessdate=10 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; He served as Ambassador to the United States and then as [[Ministry of Economic Affairs and Finance (Iran)|Minister of Economic Affairs and Finance]]. His accomplishments during this time included assisting the Shah in lending millions of dollars in aid and grants to other countries and the signing of an agreement with U.S. State Secretary [[Henry Kissinger]] to build eight [[nuclear program of Iran|nuclear power plants in Iran]].&lt;ref&gt;Milani, pp. 81–83.&lt;/ref&gt;

By the 1970s, the [[Central Intelligence Agency|CIA]] considered Ansary to be one of seventeen members of "the Shah's Inner Circle" and he was one of the Shah's top two choices to succeed [[Amir Abbas Hoveyda]] as [[Prime Minister of Iran|Prime Minister]]. Ultimately, this appointment went to [[Jamshid Amouzegar]], and Ansary became the leader of the Constructionist wing of the [[Rastakhiz Party|Rastakhiz]] party, which opposed Amouzegar's Progressive wing. Some of Ansary's supporters have seen Amouzegar's appointment as a poor decision in hindsight. Even his now ex-wife Maryam Panahi, to whom his marriage "came to a bitter end" according to historian [[Abbas Milani]],&lt;ref&gt;Milani, p. 84.&lt;/ref&gt; has said that "not appointing Hushang was one of the shah's two biggest mistakes, leading to the revolution."&lt;ref&gt;Milani, p. 83.&lt;/ref&gt; In November 1977, Ansary became the director of the [[National Iranian Oil Company]], but resigned one year later and moved to the United States, citing health problems.&lt;ref&gt;Milani, pp. 82–84.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Business and philanthropy==
During his time in the Iranian government, Ansary also maintained a successful career in business. He was the director of an unstable company called Fakhre Iran, which he made profitable and sold to the government.&lt;ref&gt;Milani, p. 81.&lt;/ref&gt; Ansary arrived in the U.S. a very wealthy man&lt;ref&gt;Milani, p. 83: "According to William Shawcross, Ansary 'was one of the richest men' in Iran."; Milani, p. 84: "...he had clearly come to America a very rich man—''Forbes'' called him a 'multimillionaire refugee'—...".&lt;/ref&gt; and became a U.S. citizen in 1986.&lt;ref name=Ellis/&gt; After settling in the United States, Ansary started the Parman Group, a [[holding company]] for leisure industries, textiles, international trade, and real estate, which included IRI International - a company that makes oilfield equipment. IRI International was sold to [[National Oilwell Varco]] in 2005.&lt;ref name=BloombergIRI&gt;{{cite web|last1=Staff|title=Bloomberg: IRI International|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/research/stocks/private/snapshot.asp?privcapId=369990|publisher=Bloomberg.com|accessdate=12 May 2015|quote=https://www.bloomberg.com/research/stocks/private/snapshot.asp?privcapId=369990}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to Parman Group, Ansary is the chairman of [[Stewart &amp; Stevenson]] LLC.&lt;ref name=Business/&gt;

He was involved in the creation of several medical and educational institutions, such as the [[University of St. Martin]] and the [[James Baker Institute]].&lt;ref name=Ellis/&gt; In February 2014, Ansary supported the ''A Thousand Years of the Persian Book'' Exhibition at the Library of Congress.&lt;ref name="A Thousand Years of the Persian Book Exhibition Opens at Library of Congress March 27"&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.loc.gov/today/pr/2014/14-037.html?loclr=rssloc | title="A Thousand Years of the Persian Book" Exhibition Opens at Library of Congress March 27 | publisher=Library of Congress | date=27 February 2014 | accessdate=27 February 2014 | author=Urschel, Donna}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Indian Contract Act, 1872''' prescribes the law relating to contracts in India. The Act was passed by [[British India]] and is based on the principles of [[English Common Law]]. It is applicable to all the states of India except the state of [[Jammu and Kashmir]]. It determines the circumstances in which promises made by the parties to a contract shall be legally binding and the enforcement of these rights and duties. DEFINITION : Under Section 2(h), Indian Contract act defines Contract as an agreement which is enforceable by law.

== Development ==

The Act as enacted originally had 266 Sections, it had wide scope and included.

* General Principles of Law of Contract-                      Sections 01 to 75
* Contract relating to Sale of Goods-                         Sections 76 to 123
* Special Contracts- Indemnity, Guarantee, Bailment &amp; Pledge- Sections 124 to 238
* Contracts relating to Partnership-                          Sections 239 to 266

Indian Contract Act embodied the simple and elementary rules relating to Sale of goods and Partnership. The developments of modern business world found the provisions contained in the Indian Contract Act inadequate to deal with the new regulations or give effect to the new principles. Subsequently, the provisions relating to the Sale of Goods and Partnership contained in the Indian Contract Act were repealed respectively in the year 1930 and 1932 and new enactments namely [http://www.vakilno1.com/bareacts/saleofgoods/s1.htm Sale of Goods and Movables Act 1930] and [http://www.vakilno1.com/bareacts/partnershipact/partnershipact.htm Indian Partnership act 1932] were re-enacted.

At present the Indian Contract Act may be divided into two parts

::* Part 1:deals with the General Principles of Law of Contract      Sections 1 to 75
::* Part 2:deals with Special kinds of Contracts such as 
        (1)Contract of Indemnity and Guarantee
        (2)Contract of Bailment and Pledge
        (3)Contract of Agency.
'''1.''' '''Offer 2(a'''):-  When one person signifies to another his willingness to do or to abstain from doing anything, with a view to obtaining the assent of that other to such act or abstinence, he is said to make a proposal.

'''2.''' '''Acceptance 2(b'''):- When the person to whom the proposal is made, signifies his assent there to, the proposal is said to be accepted.

'''3.''' '''Promise 2(b''') :- A Proposal when accepted becomes a promise. In simple words, when an offer is accepted it becomes promise.

'''5.''' '''Consideration 2(d)''':- When at the desire of the promisor, the promisee or any other person has done or abstained from doing or does or abstains from doing or promises to do or to abstain from doing something such act or abstinence or promise is called a consideration for the promise. 
	Price paid by one party for the promise of the other Technical word meaning QUID-PRO-QUO i.e. something in return.

'''6.''' '''Agreement''' 2(e)''' :- Every promise and set of promises forming the consideration for each other. In short,

&lt;math&gt;agreement = promise + consideration.&lt;/math&gt;

Therefore, there must be an agreement and it should be enforceable by law.

'''11.''' '''Void contract 2(j)''' :- A contract which ceases to be enforceable by Law becomes void when it ceases to be enforceable.

== Acceptance ==

According to Section 2(b), "When the person to whom the proposal is made, signifies his assent thereto, the proposal is said to be accepted. A proposal, when accepted, becomes a promise."

Rules:-
# Acceptance should be absolute and unqualified. If the parties are not in ad idem on all matters concerning the offer and acceptance, there is no valid contract. For example, "A" says to "B" "I offer to sell my car for Rs.50,000/-. "B" replies "I will purchase it for Rs.45,000/-". This is not acceptance and hence it amounts to a counter offer.
# It should be Communicated to the offeror. To conclude a contract between parties, the acceptance must be communicated in some prescribed form. A mere mental determination on the part of offeree to accept an offer does not amount to valid acceptance.
# Acceptance must be in the mode prescribed. If the acceptance is not according to the mode prescribed or some usual and reasonable mode(where no mode is prescribed) the offeror may intimate to the offeree within a reasonable time that acceptance is not according to the mode prescribed and may insist that the offer be accepted in the prescribed mode only. If he does not inform the offeree, he is deemed to have accepted the offer. For example, "A" makes an offer to "B" says to "B" that "if you accept the offer, reply by voice. "B" sends reply by post. It will be a valid acceptance, unless "A" informs "B" that the acceptance is not according to the prescribed mode.
# Acceptance must be given within a reasonable time before the offer lapses. If any time limit is specified, the acceptance must be given within the time, if no time limit is specified it must be given within a reasonable time.
# It cannot precede an offer. If the acceptance precedes an offer it is not a valid acceptance and does not result in contract. For example, in a company shares were allotted to a person who had not applied for them. Subsequently, when he applied for shares, he was un aware of the previous allotment . The allotment of share previous to the application is not valid.
# Acceptance by the way of conduct.
# Mere silence is no acceptance.
'''Silence does not per-se amounts to communication- Bank of India Ltd. Vs. Rustom Cowasjee- AIR 1955 Bom. 419 at P. 430; 57 Bom. L.R. 850'''- Mere silence cannot amount to any assent. It does not even amount to any representation on which any plea of estoppel may be found, unless there is a duty to make some statement or to do some act free and offer er must be consent
# Acceptance must be unambiguous and definite.
# Acceptance cannot be given before communication of an offer.

== Lawful consideration ==

According to Section 2(d), Consideration is defined as: "When at the desire of the promisor, the promisee or any other person has done or abstained from doing, or does or abstains from doing, or promises to do or abstain from doing something, such act or abstinence or promise is called consideration for the promise". Consideration means 'something in return'.

In short, Consideration means ''quid pro quo'' i.e. something in return.

An agreement must be supported by a lawful consideration on both sides. Essentials of valid consideration must include:-

*It must move at the desire of the promisor.  An act constituting consideration must have been done at the desire or request of the promiser.  If it is done at the instance of a third party or without the desire of the promisor, it will not be good consideration. For example, "A" saves "B"'s goods from fire without being ask him to do so. "A" cannot demand payment for his service.
*Consideration may move from the promisee or any other person. Under Indian law, consideration may be from the promisee of any other person i.e., even a stranger. This means that as long as there is consideration for the promisee, it is immaterial, who has furnished it. 
*Consideration must be an act, abstinence or forebearance or a returned promise. 
*Consideration may be past, present or future.  Past consideration is not consideration according to English law.  However it is a consideration as per Indian law. Example of past consideration is,  "A" renders some service to "B" at latter's desire. After a month "B" promises to compensate "A" for service rendered to him earlier. When consideration is given simultaneously with promise, it is said to be present consideration .. For example, "A" receives Rs.50/- in return for which he promises to deliver certain goods to "B". The money "A" receives is the present consideration. When consideration to one party to other is to pass subsequently to the maker of the contract, is said to be future consideration. For example. "A" promises to deliver certain goods to "B" after  a week. "B" promises to pay the price after a fortnight, such consideration is future. 
*Consideration must be real.  Consideration must be real, competent and having some value in the eyes of law. For example, "A" promises to put life to "B"'s dead wife, if "B" pay him Rs.1000/-. "A"'s promise is physically impossible of performance hence there is no real consideration. 
*Consideration must be something which the promiser is not already bound to do. A promise to do something what one is already bound to do, either by law, is not a good consideration., since it adds nothing to the previous existing legal consideration.
*Consideration need not be adequate. Consideration need not be necessarily be equal to value to something given. So long as consideration exists, the courts are not concerned as to adequacy, provided it is for some value.

The consideration or object of an agreement is lawful, unless and until it is:
#forbidden by law: If the object or the consideration of an agreement is for doing an act forbidden by law, such agreement are void. for example,"A" promises "B" to obtain an employment in public service and "B" promises to pay Rs one lakh to "A". The agreement is void as the procuring government job through unlawful means is prohibited.
#If it involves injury to a person or property of another: For example, "A" borrowed rs.100/- from"B" and executed a bond to work for "B" without pay for a period of 2 years. In case of default, "A" owes to pay the principal sum at once and huge amount of interest. This contract was held void as it involved injury to the person. 
#If courts regards it as immoral:An agreement in which consideration ir object of which is immoral is void. For example, An agreement between husband and wife for future separation is void.
#Is of such nature that, if permitted, it would defeat the provisions of any law: 
#is fraudulent, or involves or implies injury to the person or property of another, or
#Is opposed to public policy. An agreement which tends to be injurious to the public or against the public good is void. For example, agreements of trading with foreign enemy, agreement to commit crime, agreements which interfere with the administration of justice, agreements which interfere with the course of justice, stifling prosecution, maintenance and champerty.
#Agreements in restrained of legal proceedings: This deals with two category. One is, agreements restraining enforcement of rights and the other deals with agreements curtailing period of limitation.
#Trafficking in public offices and titles: agreements for sale or transfer of public offices and title or for procurement of a public recognition like Padma Vibhushan or Padma Shri etc. for monetary consideration is unlawful, being opposed to public policy.
#Agreements restricting personal liberty: agreements which unduly restricts the personal liberty of parties to it are void as being opposed by public policy.
#Marriage brokerage contact:Agreements to procure marriages for rewards are void under the ground that marriage ought to proceed with free and voluntary decisions of parties.
#Agreements interfering marital duties: Any agreement which interfere with performance of marital duty is void being opposed to public policy. An agreement between husband and wife that the wife will never leave her parental house.
#consideration may take in any form-money,goods, services, a promise to marry, a promise to forbear etc.

''Contract Opposed to Public Policy can be Repudiated by the Court of law even if that contract is beneficial for all of the parties to the contract- What considerations and objects are lawful and what not-Newar Marble Industries Pvt. Ltd. Vs. Rajasthan State Electricity Board, Jaipur, 1993&amp;nbsp;Cr. L.J. 1191 at 1197, 1198 [Raj.]-'' Agreement of which object or consideration was opposed to public policy, unlawful and void- – What better and what more can be an admission of the fact that the consideration or object of the compounding agreement was abstention by the board from criminally prosecuting the petitioner-company from offense under Section 39 of the act and that the Board has converted the crime into a source of profit or benefit to itself. This consideration or object is clearly opposed to public policy and hence the compounding agreement is unlawful and void under Section 23 of the Act. It is unenforceable as against the Petitioner-Company.

== Competent to contract ==

Section 11 of The Indian Contract Act specifies that every person is competent to contract provided:

# He should not be a minor i.e. an individual who has not attained the age of majority i.e. 18 years in normal case and 21 years if guardian is appointed by the Court.
# He should be of sound mind while making a contract. A person who is usually of unsound mind, but occasionally of sound mind, can make a contract when he is of sound mind. Similarly if a person is usually of sound mind, but occasionally of unsound mind, may not make a valid contract when he is of unsound mind.
# He is not disqualified from contracting by any other law to which he is subject

There are other laws of the land that disqualify certain persons from contracting.They are:-
                      -Alien enemy
                      -Foreign sovereigns, diplomatic staff etc.
                      -Artificial persons i.e. corporation, companies etc.
                      -Insolvents
                      -Convicts 
                      -Pardanashin Women

== Free Consent ==

According to Section 13, " two or more persons are said to be in consent when they agree upon the same thing in the same sense (''Consensus-ad-idem'').
According to Section 14,
 Consent is said to be free when it is not caused by coercion or undue influence or fraud or misrepresentation or mistake.

'''Elements Vitiating free Consent'''

1. Coercion (Section 15): "Coercion" is the committing, or threatening to commit, any act forbidden by the Indian Penal Code under(45,1860), or the unlawful detaining, or threatening to detain, any property, to the prejudice of any person whatever, with the intention of causing any person to enter into an agreement. For example, "A" threatens to shoot "B"if he doesn't release him from a debt which he owes to "B". "B" releases "A" under threat. Since the release has been brought about by coercion, such release is not valid.

2. Undue influence (Section 16): "Where a person who is in a position to dominate the will of another enters into a contract with him and the transaction appears on the face of it, or on the evidence, to be unconscionable, the burden of proving that such contract was not induced by undue influence shall lie upon the person in the position to dominate the will of the other."
:(Section 16(2)) States that "A person is deemed to be in a position to dominate the will of another;
::*Where he holds a real or apparent authority over the other. For example, an employer may be deemed to be having authority over his employee. an income tax authority over to the asessee.
::*Where he stands in a fiduciary relationship to other, For example, the relationship of Solicitor with his client, spiritual advisor and devotee.
::*Where he makes a contract with a person whose mental capacity is temporarily or permanently affected by the reason of age, illness or mental or bodily distress"

3. Fraud (Section 17): "Fraud" means and includes any act or concealment of material fact or misrepresentation made knowingly by a party to a contract, or with his connivance, or by his agent, with intent to deceive another party thereto of his agent, or to induce him to enter into the contract. Mere silence is not fraud. a contracting party is not obliged to disclose each and everything to the other party. There are two exceptions where even mere silence may be fraud, one is where there is a duty to speak, then keeping silence is fraud. or when silence is in itself equivalent to speech, such silence is fraud.

4. Misrepresentation (Section 18): " causing, however innocently, a party to an agreement to make a mistake as to the substance of the thing which is the subject of the agreement".
 
5. Mistake of fact (Section 20): "Where both the parties to an agreement are under a mistake as to a matter of fact essential to the agreement, the agreement is void". A party cannot be allowed to get any relief on the ground that he had done some particular act in ignorance of law.Mistake may be bilateral mistake where both parties to an agreement are under mistake as to the matter of fact.The mistake must relate to a matter of fact essential to the agreement.

== Agency ==

In law, the relationship that exists when one person or party (the principal) engages another (the agent) to act for him, e.g. to do his work, to sell his goods, to manage his business. The law of agency thus governs the legal relationship in which the agent deals with a third party on behalf of the principal. The competent agent is legally capable of acting for this principal vis-à-vis the third party. Hence, the process of concluding a contract through an agent involves a twofold relationship. On the one hand, the law of agency is concerned with the external business relations of an economic unit and with the powers of the various representatives to affect the legal position of the principal. On the other hand, it rules the internal relationship between principal and agent as well, thereby imposing certain duties on the representative (diligence, accounting, good faith, etc.).

Under section 201 to 210 an agency may come to an end in a variety of ways:

: (i) By the principal revoking the agency – However, principal cannot revoke an agency coupled with interest to the prejudice of such interest. Such Agency is coupled with interest. An agency is coupled with interest when the agent himself has an interest in the subject-matter of the agency, e.g., where the goods are consigned by an upcountry constituent to a commission agent for sale, with poor to recoup himself from the sale proceeds, the advances made by him to the principal against the security of the goods; in such a case, the principal cannot revoke the agent's authority till the goods are actually sold, nor is the agency terminated by death or insanity. (Illustrations to section 201)
: (ii) By the agent renouncing the business of agency;
: (iii) By the business of agency being completed;
: (iv) By the principal being adjudicated insolvent (Section 201 of The Indian Contract Act. 1872)

The principal also cannot revoke the agent's authority after it has been partly exercised, so as to bind the principal (Section 204), though he can always do so, before such authority has been so exercised (Sec 203).

Further, as per section 205, if the agency is for a fixed period, the principal cannot terminate the agency before the time expired, except for sufficient cause. If he does, he is liable to compensate the agent for the loss caused to him thereby. The same rules apply where the agent, renounces an agency for a fixed period. Notice in this connection that want of skill continuous disobedience of lawful orders, and rude or insulting behavior has been held to be sufficient cause for dismissal of an agent. Further, reasonable notice has to be given by one party to the other; otherwise, damage resulting from want of such notice, will have to be paid (Section 206). As per section 207, the revocation or renunciation of an agency may be made expressly or impliedly by conduct. The termination does not take effect as regards the agent, till it becomes known to him and as regards third party, till the termination is known to them (Section 208).Sub-agent who is appointed by an agent for participate on behalf of his work.
           
  : TYPES OF OFFER
 
    * General Offer
    * Specified offer
    * Cross offer

'''Janet Kaki Sape''' (1959 - 28 July 2017) was a business leader and international netball player, coach and administrator from [[Papua New Guinea]].   She was active in promoting women's empowerment issues in the country, and received a number of awards for her work.

== Netball ==
In the 1980s, Sape founded the Lae based netball club DSA Sisters.  The club got its name because most of the players were sisters.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.nearthehoop.com/documents/Lae%20Netball%20news%20letter%207.pdf|title=Club Profile|last=|first=|date=June 2011|work=LAE NETBALL NEWSLETTER|access-date=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|edition=11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sape represented her country in the [[1987 World Netball Championships]] in Scotland, and also in a number of tournaments in Oceania.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;   One tournament she participated in was the Pacific Games.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.thenational.com.pg/arts-crafts-can-benefit-sape/|title=Arts, crafts can benefit: Sape - The National|date=2015-02-26|work=The National|access-date=2017-11-04|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;  During her time as a member of the national team, she also served as the captain.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;  She retired from international play in 1989.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

Sape later coached the national team.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.radioaustralia.net.au/international/2001-11-02/president-of-png-netball-concerned-about-lack-of-government-support/538410|title=President of PNG Netball concerned about lack of government support|last=|first=|date=|website=Radio Australia|language=en-intl|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2017-11-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;  She was at the helm for the 1995 South Pacific Games, when Papua New Guinea took home a silver medal.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;  Players she coached on this level included Gamini Koroka.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;  Sape also served as a netball commentator.  She did this for the 1991 South Pacific Games.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

== Sports administration ==
Sape went on to become president of the Papua New Guinea Netball Federation in 1999, a role she would continue to hold until 2001.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.thenational.com.pg/westpac-hails-sapes-contribution-business/|title=Westpac hails Sape’s contribution to business - The National|date=2017-08-03|work=The National|access-date=2017-11-04|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;  She was also part of an iniative to encourage girls in more rural parts of the country to get involved in the sport, working on a project towards this goal in 2013.  At the time, she commented that if the government can spend money on developing rugby union for men, they can spend money on developing netball for women.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.thenational.com.pg/sape-supports-programme/|title=Sape supports programme - The National|date=2013-02-18|work=The National|access-date=2017-11-04|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;  These sort of comments were ones she had made repeatedly, including to the media the night before the 2012 PNG Netball Federation's Annual Fundraising Ball. &lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;

In 2000,&amp;nbsp; PNGSF and NOC created the Women in Sports Commission following the 2000 International Women in Sports Conference. Sape, who was the President of the PNG Netball Federation at the time, was selected as a committee member.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.sportcal.com/News/PressReleases/69815?sportID=190&amp;size=100|title=PNG Women in Sports Commission {{!}} News {{!}} Sportcal|last=|first=|date=|website=Sportcal|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2017-11-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sape continued to support women becoming involved in sports administration, serving as part of the 2016 Women in Sports Leadership in Port Moseby.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://sundaychronicle.com.pg/?p=1657|title=Women sports leaders meet in Pom|date=2016-12-11|work=Sunday Chronicle: PNG's Weekly Newspaper|access-date=2017-11-04|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Business ==
Sape was initially trained as a teacher before moving into business advising for women.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/programs/pacific-beat/2015-11-04/financial-educator-janet-sape-named-pngs/6910694|title=Financial educator Janet Sape named PNG's Outstanding Woman of the Year|date=2015-11-04|website=ABC News|language=en-AU|others=PNG Correspondent, Eric Tlozek|access-date=2017-11-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.thenational.com.pg/sapes-legacy-will-live/|title=Sape’s legacy ‘will live on’ - The National|date=2017-08-03|work=The National|access-date=2017-11-04|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; She mentored women to start up and manage small businesses and later started Women in Business in 2005 as a network to support and connect women entrepreneurs in Papua New Guinea. The group began with a small number of women totalling around 50 and grew to have more than 15,000 by 2015, and 20,000 members by 2017.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.spc.int/70-inspiring-pacific-women/janet-sape/|title=Janet Sape|date=2017-08-18|work=Pacific Community|access-date=2017-11-04|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://websites.sportstg.com/assoc_page.cgi?client=1-10998-0-0-0&amp;sID=356200&amp;&amp;news_task=DETAIL&amp;articleID=35213294|title=Women traders set out stalls for the Games - ONOC Media - SportsTG|website=SportsTG|language=en|access-date=2017-11-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;  She served as the organization's President and Executive Director.&lt;ref name=":10"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.voiceofmelanesia.com/2014/08/18/smol-melanesian-na-pasifik-nius-digest-1011/|title=Smol Melanesian Na Pasifik Nius Digest # 1011 {{!}} Voice of Melanesia|website=www.voiceofmelanesia.com|language=en-AU|access-date=2017-11-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

Sape believed that events like the Pacific Games were an opportunity for women entrepreneurs to provide an international platform for their goods and services.  When her country hosted the Games, she was involved in encouraging many women to set up stands to sell their goods at. &lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;  She also encouraged women to take control of their own resources to form their own business, giving specific encouragement to women in rural areas.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.emtv.com.pg/kuni-women-s-group/|title=Kuni Women’s group – EMTV Online|website=www.emtv.com.pg|language=en-US|access-date=2017-11-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sape also founded a [[microfinance]] institution, Women's Microbank in 2014, the first bank of its kind in the South Pacific region, and the fourth in the world.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":8"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://photos.state.gov/libraries/papuanewguinea/231771/PDFs/png_women_39s_Directory.pdf|title=Papua New Guinea's Women's Directory|last=|first=|date=|website=US State Department|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":11"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.voiceofmelanesia.com/2014/11/30/smol-melanesian-na-pasifik-nius-digest-1048-sundau-30-november-2014/|title=Smol Melanesian Na Pasifik Nius Digest # 1048 ( Sundau 30 November 2014 ) {{!}} Voice of Melanesia|website=www.voiceofmelanesia.com|language=en-AU|access-date=2017-11-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;  NCD Governor Powes Parkop commended her for her efforts in creating the microbank.&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt; She also served as the President of the PNG Women in Business Foundation (PNGWiB), an organization founded in 2006.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt; In 2014, she attended the Women in Business Conference.&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt;

== Politics and activism ==
Sape was well known in her country for her activism related to women's empowerment.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; Sape was an unsuccessful candidate in four national elections, including the election of July 2017 where she ran for the North-West seat in the Port Moresby general elections.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; She had previously run for the same seat in 2002, coming in fifth in a 32 deep field.  In 2006, she ran for governor of Port Moseby, coming in second.&lt;ref name=":9"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://pg.one.un.org/content/dam/unct/papua%20new%20guinea/docs/publications/UN_PNG_Annual%20Progress%20Report_2012.pdf|title=Playing the political game in PNG|last=|first=|date=2012|website=ANNUAL PROGRESS REPORT 2012|publisher=United Nations|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;   She ran for the same seat in the 2012 elections, finishing third.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt;  In 2012, she participated in the PNG Practice Parliament for Women.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt;  This was part of her efforts to prepare women to run for Parliament as the country has few women who run, and even fewer who win seats.  The Practice Parliament was covered on national radio.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt;

Serving on the National Capital District Commission Board, she represented the interests of women and girls.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;  In 2014, she served as the NCDC's commissioner.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.voiceofmelanesia.com/2014/11/17/smol-melanesian-na-pasifik-nius-digest-1045-monday-17-november-2014/|title=Smol Melanesian Na Pasifik Nius Digest # 1045 ( Monday 17 November 2014 )  {{!}} Voice of Melanesia|website=www.voiceofmelanesia.com|language=en-AU|access-date=2017-11-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

== Background ==
Sape was born and raised in [[Wabag]], the capital of [[Enga Province]] and initially trained as a teacher before moving into business advising for women.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;  The switch in career trajectory came after a personal realization that she had talent in business.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;  She had six children.  As of 2012, she had two grandchildren.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt;  Sape died on 28 July 2017 from [[leukemia]].&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://postcourier.com.pg/former-netball-president-passes-away/|title=Former netball president passes away&amp;nbsp;— Post Courier|website=postcourier.com.pg|language=en-US|access-date=2017-11-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Awards ==
In 2015, Sape was named by [[Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation|APEC]] as the first winner of Papua New Guinea's Iconic Women Award. In the same year, she was named Westpac’s Outstanding Woman of the Year.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.loopvanuatu.com/content/wow-awards-winners-2016|title=WOW Awards winners for 2016|work=Loop Vanuatu|access-date=2017-11-04|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It was his father, who convinced him to study [[medicine]], however in the beginning Simons wanted to study physics.&lt;ref name="pmid19114590" /&gt; While studying in [[University of Helsinki]], Simons spent a summer internship in [[Stockholm]] laboratory of [[Bengt Samuelsson]]&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ascb.org/ascb-members-profile-archives/|title=ASCB Members Profile Archives - Kai Simons|last=|first=|date=2009-08-13|website=|publisher=The American Society for Cell Biology|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070715061747/http://www.ascb.org/index.cfm?navid=110&amp;id=1331&amp;tcode=nws3|archive-date=2007-07-15|access-date=2016-07-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; Simons worked there on mechanisms of [[vitamin B12]] absorption&lt;ref name="pmid19114590" /&gt; In his student's years together with fellow students he organized anti-[[taeniasis]] campaign, the disease common in the eastern Finland where eating raw [[fish]] is popular.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

After completing his PhD in medicine in 1964, he began a [[postdoctoral fellowship]] at [[Rockefeller University]] in [[New York City|New York]] where he worked between 1966 and 1967 on [[blood serum]] [[protein]] [[Polymorphism (biology)|polymorphism]]&lt;ref name="pmid19114590" /&gt; He came back to Helsinki in 1967, where he started to work as a Junior Investigator for the Finnish Medical Research Council at the [[University of Helsinki]].&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.mpi-cbg.de/research-groups/current-groups/kai-simons/group-leader.html|title=Kai Simons|last=|first=|date=|website=MPI CBG Research Group -: Group Leader|publisher=Max Planck Institute of Molecular Cell Biology and Genetics|access-date=2016-07-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; He became a group leader in 1972 and was a biochemistry professor in 1971–79 at the medical faculty of this university&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; In the beginning he continued his work on serum proteins. Next, together with [[Leevi Kääriäinen]] and [[Ossi Renkonen]], he started a research team - later joined by [[Ari Helenius]], his first PhD student and later a post doctoral researcher who became Simons' [[brother-in-law]]. After one-month stay in [[Laboratory of Molecular Biology|MRC Laboratory for Molecular Biology]] in [[Cambridge]], the group started investigating a [[Semliki Forest virus]], introduced to Simons by Kääriäinenem.&lt;ref name="pmid19114590" /&gt;

In 1975 Simons came to [[Heidelberg]] (Germany), as one of the [[European Molecular Biology Laboratory|EMBL]] group leaders. Together with Ari Helenius he helped to develop EMBL, headed at this time by [[John Kendrew]].&lt;ref name="pmid19114590" /&gt; In years 1982–1998 Simons was a coordinator of the Cell Biology Program there.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; During this time he for the first time presented the concept of [[lipid rafts]].

In 1999 he took part in setting up [[European Molecular Biology Organization|ELSO]] (later incorporated into [[European Molecular Biology Organization|EMBO]]), which later he presided over.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Gransalke|first=Kathleen|date=2014|title=There Are No Easy Solutions|url=http://www.labtimes.org/epaper/LT_14_04.pdf|journal=Lab Times|volume=4|issue=|pages=34–37|doi=|issn=1864-2381|pmid=|access-date=2016-07-27|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He was one of the initiators of establishing and building [[Max Planck Institute of Molecular Cell Biology and Genetics]] in [[Dresden]] ([[Germany]]), where he moved. Formally from 1998 (beginning of MPI-CBG construction) and practically from 2000 he was one of five institute's directors and also a group leader there&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Since 2006 he is a ''director emeritus''.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

In 2012 he started-up a [[biotech company]] Lipotype GmbH, where he is a [[CEO]].&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

He is married to Carola Simons and a father of three: twins - Mikael ([[neurobiology|neurobiologist]]) and Katja ([[sociology|sociologist]] and [[spatial planning]]), and the youngest of three, Matias (physician).&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

== Work ==
In the beginning Kai Simons pursued research in the field of medical biochemistry and his [[master's thesis]] as well as PhD focused on vitamin B12 absorption.&lt;ref name="pmid19114590" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Grasbeck|first=R.|last2=Runeberg|first2=L.|last3=Simons|first3=K.|date=1959-12-12|title=Intrinsic factor and radiovitamin B12 excretion in rats|journal=Acta Physiologica Scandinavica|volume=47|pages=370–374|issn=0001-6772|pmid=13828995}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Grasbeck|first=R.|last2=Simons|first2=K.|last3=Sinkkonen|first3=I.|date=1962-01-01|title=Purification of intrinsic factor and vitamin B12 binders from human gastric juice|journal=Annales Medicinae Experimentalis et Biologiae Fenniae|volume=40(Suppl 6)|pages=1–24|issn=0003-4479|pmid=13949889}}&lt;/ref&gt; After returning from his post-doc scholarship he continued research on vitamin B12 as well as on [[Blood proteins|blood plasma proteins]], but soon started investigating Semliki Forest virus, focusing on its [[biological membrane|membrane]] and its [[lipids|lipid]] composition and their role in the [[Viral shedding|virus budding]] and its transport, as the model for lipid and [[protein secretion]].&lt;ref name="pmid19114590" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Renkonen O, Gahmberg CG, Kaariainen L, Simons K |title=Envelope of Semliki Forest virus as membrane model |journal=Biochem.

Protein Chem. |volume=36 |issue= |pages=79–132 |year=1984 |pmid=6382965 |doi= |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; During this period, Simons also investigated the application of [[detergents]] in biochemistry with a special attention to their role in biological membrane research.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Helenius A, Simons K |title=Solubilization of membranes by detergents |journal=Biochim.

The virus [[Biological life cycle|lifecycle]] and how it uses components of [[Vesicle (biology and chemistry)|vesicular]] pathways while shuttling to the cell surface, turned Simons' attention toward vesicular transport pathways and [[Cell polarity|cell polarization]]. Applying [[epithelium|epithelial]] [[Cell culture|model cells]] - [[Madin-Darby Canine Kidney cells|MDCK]] (Madin-Darby canine kidney), he investigated lipid transport, protein sorting and their role in polarizing cells.&lt;ref name="pmid19114590" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Simons K, Fuller SD |title=Cell surface polarity in epithelia |journal=Annu.

During these studies he described the role of [[trans-Golgi network]] (TGN) in protein and lipid sorting according to their destination.&lt;ref name="pmid2945253" /&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid19114590" /&gt; In his works from 1988, together with [[Gerit van Meer]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=van Meer G, Simons K |title=Lipid polarity and sorting in epithelial cells |journal=J.

Simons termed these microdomains as [[lipid rafts]]. This concept was developed over the years to be presented more fully in 1997 in ''[[Nature (journal)|Nature]]'' journal by Simons and Ikonen.&lt;ref name="pmid9177342" /&gt; This paper became one of the most frequently cited works in the field of membrane research.

Kai Simons was also recognized by [[ISI Web of Knowledge]], as one of the most cited scientist ever.

In next years, Simons continued to work on the role of lipid rafts, and more generally lipids, in cell polarization and protein sorting.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Klemm|first=Robin W.|last2=Ejsing|first2=Christer S.|last3=Surma|first3=Michal A.|last4=Kaiser|first4=Hermann-Josef|last5=Gerl|first5=Mathias J.|last6=Sampaio|first6=Julio L.|last7=de Robillard|first7=Quentin|last8=Ferguson|first8=Charles|last9=Proszynski|first9=Tomasz J.|date=2009-05-18|title=Segregation of sphingolipids and sterols during formation of secretory vesicles at the trans-Golgi network|journal=The Journal of Cell Biology|volume=185|issue=4|pages=601–612|doi=10.1083/jcb.200901145|issn=1540-8140|pmc=2711577|pmid=19433450|url=https://dash.harvard.edu/bitstream/handle/1/4513029/2711577.pdf?sequence=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was interested also in the role of lipids and protein sorting in [[neurodegenerative diseases]], especially in [[Alzheimer's disease]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Rajendran|first=Lawrence|last2=Honsho|first2=Masanori|last3=Zahn|first3=Tobias R.|last4=Keller|first4=Patrick|last5=Geiger|first5=Kathrin D.|last6=Verkade|first6=Paul|last7=Simons|first7=Kai|date=2006-07-25|title=Alzheimer's disease beta-amyloid peptides are released in association with exosomes|journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America|volume=103|issue=30|pages=11172–11177|doi=10.1073/pnas.0603838103|issn=0027-8424|pmc=1544060|pmid=16837572}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Rajendran|first=Lawrence|last2=Schneider|first2=Anja|last3=Schlechtingen|first3=Georg|last4=Weidlich|first4=Sebastian|last5=Ries|first5=Jonas|last6=Braxmeier|first6=Tobias|last7=Schwille|first7=Petra|last8=Schulz|first8=Jörg B.|last9=Schroeder|first9=Cornelia|date=2008-04-25|title=Efficient inhibition of the Alzheimer's disease beta-secretase by membrane targeting|journal=Science |volume=320|issue=5875|pages=520–523|doi=10.1126/science.1156609|issn=1095-9203|pmid=18436784}}&lt;/ref&gt;

His scientific record includes more than 350 [[scientific article]]s, mostly in the field of biochemistry, molecular organization of the cell, and biochemistry and physiology of a cell membrane.

Considering his work from years 1996–2007 tracked until May 2009, Simons was 12. in the list of the most frequently cited scientists in the field [[cell biology]] with 90 articles and 16,299 citations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Neumann|first=Ralf|date=2009|title=Publication Analysis 1996-2007.

'''Libertarian management''' is participative and/or non-authoritarian self-management, which typically emphasizes repetition of proven successes, institutional learning, and earmarking funds to project investment. Libertarian consultants generally focus on management and system productivity, not worker productivity.  Libertarian management exponents believe the method can be applied beyond industrial settings in areas such as alternate family arrangements, [[co-housing]], and the [[cooperative]] movement.

While no text on the subject exists, libertarian management has been highly influential as a guiding concept among American Libertarian founders of [[intentional communities]] and American management productivity [[consultant]]s. Noted proponents of libertarian management include [[W. Edwards Deming]] and [[Peter Drucker]]. Many companies use the concepts and techniques of libertarian management, some of which are listed below.{{citation needed|date=December 2011}}

==Libertarian management and the US Libertarian Party==

The last three chairs{{which?|date=April 2014}} of the [[Libertarian Party (United States)|United States Libertarian Party]] have worked as management consultants. Members of the Party often{{quantify|date=April 2014}} refer to organizations using Libertarian management as "do-cracies" - systems which emphasize decision-making by the initiators and implementers (i.e. doers) of a [[project]].  Typically, decisions in such a do-ocracy come about through a [[Consensus decision-making|consensus]] process.

==Concepts of libertarian management==

'''Lyndall Fownes Urwick''' (3 March 1891 – 5 December 1983) was a British [[management consultant]] and [[organizational theorist|business thinker]]. He is recognised for integrating the ideas of earlier theorists like [[Henri Fayol]] into a comprehensive theory of management administration.&lt;ref&gt;John Sheldrake (2003) ''Management Theory''. p. 92&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Derek Salman Pugh]], [[David John Hickson]] (2007) ''Great Writers on Organizations''. p. 148&lt;/ref&gt; He wrote an influential book called ''The Elements of Business Administration'', published in 1943.&lt;ref&gt;[[March, James G.]], and [[Herbert Alexander Simon]]. ''Organizations.'' (1958).&lt;/ref&gt; With [[Luther Gulick (social scientist)|Luther Gulick]], he founded the academic journal ''[[Administrative Science Quarterly]]''.&lt;ref&gt;James Everett Katz (2011) ''Mobile Communication: Dimensions of Social Policy.'' p. 40&lt;/ref&gt;

== Biography ==
=== Youth and military service ===
Urwick was born in Worcestershire, the son of a partner in Fownes Brothers, a long-established glove-making firm. He was educated at [[Boxgrove Primary School]], [[Repton School]] and [[New College, Oxford|New College]], Oxford, where he read History.

He saw active service in the trenches during the [[First World War]], rising to the rank of Major, and being awarded the [[Military Cross]]. Though he did not himself attend the military [[Staff College]] at Camberley, his respect for military training would affect his outlook on management in later life.&lt;ref name=OUPUrwick /&gt;

===Rowntree's===

After the war, he joined his father's business of Fownes Brothers. He was then recruited by [[Seebohm Rowntree]], head of the York chocolate company and progressive philanthropist. Urwick's role involved assisting the modernisation of the company, bringing to bear his own thinking, which had two main influences. One was the work of [[Frederick Winslow Taylor|F.W. Taylor]] with its concept of ''[[scientific management]]'', and the other, counterbalancing it in its emphasis on the humanity of management was [[Mary Parker Follett]], for whom he had great admiration.&lt;ref name=OUPUrwick&gt;E.F.L. Brech, Andrew Thomson, John F. Wilson, ''Lyndall Urwick, Management Pioneer: A Biography'' (New York: Oxford University Press, 2010)&lt;/ref&gt;

Urwick's own prolific writings on management truly began in this period. At this time, Urwick, along with his colleague at [[Rowntree's]], [[Oliver Sheldon]], became active members of the [[Taylor Society]].&lt;ref&gt;'Major Urwick', ''Bulletin of the Taylor Society'' (April 1931)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=OUPUrwick /&gt;&lt;ref name=Weatherburn /&gt;

===International Management Institute===

His growing reputation as a British thinker on management and administration won him appointment in 1928 as Director of the [[International Institute for Management Development|International Management Institute]] in [[Geneva]].&lt;ref name=OUPUrwick /&gt;

The Institute may have proven short-lived, closing in 1933,&lt;ref name="Link"&gt;[[Charles D. Wrege]], Ronald G. Greenwood, and Sakae Hata, 'The International Management Institute and Political Opposition to its Efforts in Europe, 1925-1934' ''Business and Economic History'' (1987)[http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.392.2216&amp;rep=rep1&amp;type=pdf  PDF link]&lt;/ref&gt; but it provided Urwick the opportunity not only to lecture widely but to produce his books ''The Meaning of Rationalisation'' (1929) and ''The Management of Tomorrow'' (1933).&lt;ref name=OUPUrwick /&gt;

Urwick also produced and disseminated the first European study of [[Elton Mayo]]'s research at the [[Hawthorne Works]] in [[Chicago]] while at the IMI.&lt;ref&gt;International Management Institute, ''Industrial Research at the Western Electric Company Inc. (USA)'' (1931)&lt;/ref&gt;

It was also this time that he became particularly keen to promote the writings of [[Henri Fayol]] to an English audience.&lt;ref name=OUPUrwick /&gt;

===Management consultancy===

Having returned to Britain, in 1934 Urwick established, with John Orr of [[Charles Bedaux|Bedaux Britain]], a [[management consultancy]] named [[Urwick, Orr &amp; Partners]] (UOP).&lt;ref name=OUPUrwick /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Patricia Tisdall, ''Agents of Change: The Development and Practice of Management Consultancy'' (London: Heinemann, 1982).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Ferguson&gt;Michael Ferguson, ''The Rise of Management Consulting in Britain'' (Aldershot: Ashgate, 2002)&lt;/ref&gt; UOP's slogan was ''Profit on Principle: A British Service for British Business in the application of the Principles of Direction and Control.''&lt;ref name=UOPHistory&gt;Lyndall Urwick Society, ''The Urwick Orr Partnership, 1934-1984''
(privately printed, Lyndall Urwick Society, 2007).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Weatherburn&gt;Michael R. Weatherburn, 'Scientific Management at Work: the Bedaux System, Management Consulting, and Worker Efficiency in British Industry, 1914-48' (Imperial College PhD thesis, 2014) {{cite journal|url= https://spiral.imperial.ac.uk/handle/10044/1/25296 |title=Download PDF from Imperial College, London |date=July 2014 |last1=Weatherburn |first1=Michael }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Urwick Orr &amp; Partners (1934).jpg|thumb|Urwick Orr &amp; Partners (1934)]]

From the outset, UOP instituted a copy of the [[Bedaux System]] and [[Bedaux Unit]], the ''Point System'', in hundreds of factories and offices across [[United Kingdom|Britain]] and further afield.&lt;ref name=UOPHistory /&gt;&lt;ref name=Weatherburn /&gt;

Orr left the consultancy in the 1940s, putting Urwick in effective control of the company in the postwar period.&lt;ref name=UOPHistory /&gt; Along with [[Associated Industrial Consultants|AIC]], [[P-E]] and [[PA Consulting]], UOP came to be one of the 'Big Four' leading Western European consultancies in the 1950s.&lt;ref&gt;Matthias Kipping, 'Consultancies, Institutions and the Diffusion of Taylorism in Britain, Germany and France, 1920s to 1950s', ''Business History'' (1997) [http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/00076799700000146 PDF from Taylor &amp; Francis online]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Ferguson /&gt;

A particularly notable UOP [[consultant]] was [[Edward Francis Leopold Brech|E.F.L. Brech]], with whom Urwick wrote the ''[[Making of Scientific Management]]'' trilogy.&lt;ref name=KreisThesis&gt;Steven Kreis, 'The Diffusion of an Idea: A History of Scientific Management in Britain, 1890-1945' (PhD thesis, University of Missouri-Columbia, 1990) [http://www.worldcat.org/title/diffusion-of-an-idea-a-history-of-scientific-management-in-britain-1890-1945/oclc/25526850?referer=di&amp;ht=edition entry on WorldCat]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=UOPHistory /&gt;

===Later years===

In the post-war period Urwick appeared on the lecturing circuit on both sides of the [[Atlantic]], including on the [[BBC]].&lt;ref&gt;Lyndall Urwick, 'Individual versus Card-Index' ''The Listener'' (1949)&lt;/ref&gt;

Urwick became a well-known enthusiast of management education and management history, and a public promoter of [[Frederick Winslow Taylor|F.W. Taylor]] and [[scientific management]].&lt;ref&gt;Michael Roper, 'Killing Off the Father: Social Science and the Memory of Frederick Taylor in Management Studies, 1950-75' ''Contemporary British History'' (1999).&lt;/ref&gt; So much so that [[Harry Braverman]] attacked him in 1974's ''[[Labor and Monopoly Capital]]'' as the 'rhapsodic historian of the scientific management movement'.&lt;ref name="mr"&gt;{{cite book |url=http://monthlyreview.org/press/books/pb9401/ |last=Braverman |first=Harry |title=Labor and Monopoly Capital: The Degradation of Work in the Twentieth Century |location=New York |publisher=Monthly Review Press |date=January 1998 |isbn=978-0-85345-940-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1955 Urwick was awarded the [[Wallace Clark Award]]. In later years, Lyndall Urwick retired to [[Australia]], where he died in 1983. His papers were donated to the [[Administrative Staff College]], by then renamed [[Henley Management College]].&lt;ref name=OUPUrwick /&gt;

== Work ==

=== ''Making of Scientific Management'' ===
In 1945, he made his most lasting contribution to management literature with the publication of his three-volume ''Making of Scientific Management''.  It was the first treatise to present a clear and focused discussion of the development and applications of management science. It included a comprehensive number of profiles of leading proponents of management theory, from early pioneers such as [[Charles Babbage]] and [[Frederick Winslow Taylor]], to those such as [[Seebohm Rowntree]] and [[Mary Parker Follett]] who innovated and refined their concepts.

All aimed to bring '"adequate intelligence" to the control of the forces released by a mechanised economy' to bring the logical standards of science to bear on business practice. It also dealt with early contributions to understanding the scientific approach to control in industry.  A long background of scientific management practices had previously been largely unknown before publication of these volumes. The study included a view of methods of control at the famous [[Boulton and Watt]] Foundry, of [[Robert Owen]]'s approach to personnel management, and of commercial management training.

===The Manager's Span of Control===
Lyndall Urwick was the first writer to apply the concept of [[span of control]] formally to business. Urwick asserted that the reduction of less important daily duties is essential for enhancing the ''personal touch'' that makes a business executive an effective leader.&lt;ref name="Urwick"&gt;Urwick, Lyndall F. "[http://www.nickols.us/Span.pdf Manager's Span of Control]." ''Harvard Business Review'' 34.3 (May–June 1956). p. 39-47&lt;/ref&gt; Using the work of General Sir [[Ian Standish Monteith Hamilton]], Urwick maintained that limiting the number of subordinates reporting to an executive ( i.e. restricting the span of control) can do the following: improve executive effectiveness; reduce pressure, inefficiency and incompetence; produce better employee co-operation; and build morale and sense of unity within the organisation.&lt;ref name="Urwick" /&gt;

After a conversation with Urwick, [[A.V. Graicunas]] wrote an article, "Relationship in Organization", that was published in 1933 in the ''Bulletin'' of the [[International Institute for Management Development|International Management Institute]]. In this article, Graicunas noted that superiors must be cognizant of not only their direct relationships of their subordinates, but the cross relationships between subordinates and different subgroupings.&lt;ref name="Urwick" /&gt; Graicunas went on to apply a mathematical formula to show that each increase of direct relationships by 1 represented a 25% increase in power to delegate and more than a 100% increase in the burden of supervision and co-ordination.&lt;ref name="Urwick" /&gt; Urwick expanded on these findings to provide the recommendation that "no superior can supervise directly the work of more than five or, at the most, six subordinates whose work interlocks".&lt;ref name="Urwick" /&gt;

Urwick’s application of the span of control to business was not met without criticism. [[Herbert A. Simon]] questioned the theoretical soundness of the concept and suggested that a restricted span of control would produce excessive red tape.&lt;ref name="Urwick" /&gt; Urwick countered this criticism by noting that if span of control is appropriately implemented this will not occur. [[Burleigh B. Gardner]] criticised span of control as prohibiting democratic participation within the organisation.&lt;ref name="Urwick" /&gt; Urwick countered this criticism by noting that too wide of a span of control reduces democracy because it prevents subordinates from having meaningful interaction with superiors. Additionally, other scholars criticised the principle as incorrect because of examples of efficient organisations that has an expanded span of control. Urwick addressed this criticism by noting that in these situations subordinates' work did not overlock. Therefore, these organisations were exceptions.

Reasons that leaders ignore the principle of span of control were also addressed by Urwick. Three primary "human failings" are described including: the failure of business to distinguish rank or status from function; cost-consciousness of businessmen; and the cherishing of the stereotype of the ''efficient executive''.&lt;ref name="Urwick" /&gt; Urwick noted that effective leaders will overcome these failings and begin to ''lead'' and not ''dominate'' his or her subordinates.&lt;ref name="Urwick" /&gt;

=== Management education in Britain ===
In the 1940s and 1950s Urwick's intellectual interests continued. An increasing concern of his was the lack of management education in Britain. He was involved in the very earliest discussions for what would become, in 1948, the [[Administrative Staff College]].&lt;ref&gt;Yvette Bryan, ''Management Education in England: The Urwick Report'', Exeter University PhD thesis (2009). Online [https://ore.exeter.ac.uk/repository/bitstream/handle/10036/93959/BryanY.pdf?sequence=2 here].&lt;/ref&gt; His own view of the education required did not accord with the College as it was finally established, which concentrated on a three-month course for established executives. He would have preferred something much closer to the model of the American [[business school]], involving a longer course and aimed at pre-experience students. It was a continuing frustration for Urwick that England's two ancient universities failed to promote management education.&lt;ref name=OUPUrwick /&gt;

'''Mohamed Al-Fayed''' ({{IPAc-en|æ|l|f|aɪ|ˈ|ɛ|d}}; {{lang-arz|محمد أنور شاكر عبد السيد الفايد}} {{IPA-arz|mahamad el fajed|}}; born Mohamed Fayed on 27 January 1929) is an [[Egypt]]ian business magnate. Fayed's business interests include ownership of [[Hôtel Ritz Paris]] and formerly [[Harrods Department Store]], [[Knightsbridge]]. Al-Fayed sold his ownership of [[Fulham F.C.]] to [[Shahid Khan]] in 2013.&lt;ref name="Fulham Sold"/&gt; 

Fayed had a son, [[Dodi Fayed|Dodi]], from his first marriage to [[Samira Khashoggi|Samira Khashoggi]] from 1954 to 1956. Dodi [[Death of Diana, Princess of Wales|died in a car crash in Paris with Diana, Princess of Wales]] on 31 August 1997. Fayed later remarried to Finnish [[socialite]] and former model Heini Wathén in 1985, with whom he has four children: Jasmine, Karim, Camilla, and [[Omar Fayed|Omar]]. In 2013, Fayed's wealth was estimated at [[US$]]1.4 billion, making him the 1,031st-richest person in the world in 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last= |first= |title=The World's Millionaires|url=https://www.forbes.com/billionaires/list/||publisher=Forbes| accessdate=18 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==
He was born '''Mohamed Fayed''' on 27 January 1929, in [[Bakos]], [[Alexandria]], [[Kingdom of Egypt|Egypt]],&lt;ref&gt;[[Who's Who]] 2008: London, [[A &amp; C Black]], 2008 {{ISBN|978-0-7136-8555-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; the eldest son of an Egyptian primary school teacher.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Mohamed Al Fayed — the outsider with a taste for confrontation|url=http://www.thetimes.co.uk/tto/business/moversshakers/article2506457.ece|accessdate=9 November 2015|newspaper=The Times|date=10 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fayed has five siblings: Ali, Ashraf, Salah, Soaad, and Safia.{{fact|date=April 2018}}&lt;!-- A brother called Ashraf cannot be confirmed online; his 2 sisters are indicated in marginally applicable sources or non-RS. --&gt; Ali and Salah have been his business colleagues.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Wild|first=Abigail|url=http://www.heraldscotland.com/news/12518304.Beset_by_secrets_and_lies_Profile__Mohamed_al_Fayed_A_high_profile_bid_to_become_a_British_citizen_and_the_death_of_his_son__Dodi__have_thrust_the_Egyptian_tycoon_into_the_spotlight__but_who_is_the_real_Mohamed_al_Fayed__By_Abigail_Wild/|title=Beset by secrets and lies Profile: Mohamed al Fayed|work=Sunday Herald|location=Glasgow|date=&lt;!-- Sunday --&gt;10 January 2004|accessdate=22 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

He was married for two years, from 1954 to 1956, to [[Samira Khashoggi]]. Fayed worked for his wife's brother, Saudi Arabian arms dealer and businessman [[Adnan Khashoggi]].&lt;ref name="Independent20071006"&gt;{{cite news|last=Vallely|first=Paul|title=Mohamed al-Fayed: The outsider|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/people/profiles/mohamed-alfayed-the-outsider-396133.html|accessdate=26 February 2013|newspaper=The Independent|date=6 October 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some time in the early 1970s, he began using "Al-Fayed" rather than "Fayed". His brothers Ali and Salah began to follow suit at the time of their acquisition of the [[House of Fraser]] in the 1980s, though by the late 1980s, both had reverted to calling themselves simply "Fayed".&lt;ref name="Brooke Aldous, 1988, 619" &gt;{{harvnb|Brooke Aldous|1988a|p=619}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some have assumed that Fayed's addition of "Al-" to his name was to imply aristocratic origins, like "de" in French or "von" in German, though ''Al-'' does not have the same social connotations in Arabic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Mohamed al-Fayed: The outsider|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/people/profiles/mohamed-al-fayed-the-outsider-396133.html|accessdate=6 March 2016|work=[[The Independent]]|date=5 October 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; This assumption led to ''[[Private Eye (magazine)|Private Eye]]'' nicknaming him the "Phoney Pharaoh".&lt;ref name='TelegJun13'&gt;{{cite web|title=£1.5bn change in store at Harrods|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/newsbysector/retailandconsumer/7697397/1.5bn-change-in-store-at-Harrods.html|author=Richard Tyler and Robert Mendick|work=The Daily Telegraph|accessdate=19 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Early business dealings===
Fayed and his brothers founded a shipping company in Egypt before moving its headquarters to Genoa, Italy with additional offices in [[London]]. Around 1964 Fayed entered a close relationship with Haitian leader [[François Duvalier]], known as 'Papa Doc' Duvalier, and became interested in the construction of a Fayed-Duvalier oil refinery in [[Haiti]]. He also associated with the geologist [[George de Mohrenschildt]]. Fayed terminated his stay in Haiti six months later when a sample of "crude oil" provided by Haitian associates proved to be low-grade molasses.&lt;ref name=tunzelmann&gt;{{cite book|author=Alex Tunzelmann|title=[[Red Heat. Conspiracy, Murder, and the Cold War in the Caribbean]]|publisher=Henry Holt and Co., 2011|page=330f|isbn=978-0-8050-9067-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It was then that Fayed moved to [[England]] where he lived in [[central London]].&lt;ref name="Times20100510"&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/mohamed-al-fayed-the-outsider-with-a-taste-for-confrontation-n9tsq2qp8z0 |title=Mohamed Al Fayed — the outsider with a taste for confrontation |last=Lindsay |first=Robert |date=10 May 2010 |work=The Times |access-date=25 January 2018 |language=en |issn=0140-0460}} {{Registration required}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the mid 1960s, Fayed met the ruler of Dubai, Sheikh [[Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum]] who entrusted Fayed with helping transform [[Dubai]], where he set up IMS (International Marine Services) in 1968.&lt;ref name="Salihovic2015"&gt;{{cite book|last=Salihovic|first=Elnur|title=Major Players in the Muslim Business World|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=aSa1DAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA117|accessdate=26 January 2018|date=5 October 2015|publisher=[[Universal Publishers (United States)|Universal Publishers]]|isbn=9781627340526|pages=117–118}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fayed introduced British companies like the [[Costain Group]] (of which he became a director and 30 percent [[shareholder]]&lt;ref name="Independent20071006"/&gt;), [[Bernard Sunley &amp; Sons]] and [[Taylor Woodrow]] to the Emirate to carry out the required construction work.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1985/09/08/business/harrod-s-new-owner-mohamed-al-fayed-a-quiet-acquisitor-is-caught-in-a-cross-fire.html |title=Harrod's New Owner: Mohamed Al-Fayed; a Quiet Acquisitor Is Caught in a Cross Fire |last=Feder |first=Barnaby J. |date=8 September 1985 |work=The New York Times |access-date=25 January 2018 |language=en-US |issn=0362-4331}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Times20100510"/&gt; He also became a financial adviser to the then [[Sultan of Brunei]] [[Omar Ali Saifuddien III]], in 1966.&lt;ref name="Independent20071006"/&gt;

He briefly joined the board of the mining conglomerate [[Lonrho]] in 1975 but left after a disagreement. In 1979, Fayed bought [[Hôtel Ritz Paris|The Ritz]] hotel in [[Paris]], [[France]] for US$30 million.&lt;ref&gt;"The Ritz Paris" ''Mark Boxer'', ''Thames and Hudson'' 1991.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1984, Fayed and his brothers purchased a 30 percent stake in [[House of Fraser]], a group that included the famous London store [[Harrods]], from [[Tiny Rowland|Roland 'Tiny' Rowland]], the head of Lonrho. In 1985, he and his brothers bought the remaining 70 percent of House of Fraser for £615m. Rowland claimed the Fayed brothers had lied about their background and wealth and put pressure on the government to investigate them. A [[Department of Trade and Industry (United Kingdom)|Department of Trade and Industry]] (DTI) inquiry into the Fayeds was launched. The DTI's subsequent report was critical, but no action was taken against the Fayeds, and while many believed the contents of the report, others felt it was politically motivated.&lt;ref&gt;"The Guardian" ''Finance: DTI inquiries under attack'', by ''Lisa Buckingham'', 5 June 1997.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1998, Rowland accused Fayed of stealing papers and jewels from his Harrods [[safe deposit box]]. Fayed was arrested, but the charges were dropped.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/136111.stm|title= Harrods Box Charges Dropped|publisher=BBC| date=20 July 1998}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rowland died in 1998. Fayed settled the dispute with a payment to his widow; he also sued the [[Metropolitan Police]] for false arrest in 2002, but lost the case.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2002/aug/14/jamiewilson?INTCMP=SRCH|title=Fayed loses High Court Action Against Met|newspaper=The Guardian|date=13 August 2002|first=Jamie|last=Wilson}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1994, House of Fraser went public, but Fayed retained private ownership of Harrods. He relaunched the humour publication ''[[Punch magazine|Punch]]'' in 1996 but it folded again in 2002. Al Fayed unsuccessfully applied for [[British citizenship]] twice – once in 1994 and once in 1999.&lt;ref name="Al Fayed Story"&gt;{{cite news|url= http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/55867.stm|title=Al Fayed: A Unique Story of Rags to Riches|publisher=BBC|date=12 February 1998}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/people/law-report-minister-acted-unfairly-towards-the-fayeds-1353132.html|newspaper=The Independent|title=Law Report|date=19 November 1996}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was suggested that the feud with Rowland contributed to Fayed's being refused British citizenship the first time.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/7248639.stm BBC News] Retrieved 18 February 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cash-for-questions===
In 1994, in what became known as the [[cash-for-questions affair]], Fayed revealed the names of MPs he had paid to ask questions in parliament on his behalf, but who had failed to declare their fees. It saw the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative]] MPs [[Neil Hamilton (politician)|Neil Hamilton]] and [[Tim Smith (UK politician)|Tim Smith]] leave the government in disgrace, and a Committee on Standards in Public Life established to prevent such corruption occurring again. Fayed also revealed that the cabinet minister [[Jonathan Aitken]] had stayed for free at the [[Hôtel Ritz Paris|Ritz Hotel in Paris]] at the same time as a group of Saudi arms dealers leading to Aitken's subsequent unsuccessful libel case and imprisonment for perjury.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/196466.stm|title=UK Politics: Talking Politics, Neil Hamilton – A chronology|publisher=BBC|date=19 October 1998}}&lt;/ref&gt; During this period, from 1988 to February 1998,  Al-Fayed's spokesman was [[Michael Cole (public relations)|Michael Cole]], a former BBC journalist,&lt;ref&gt;Steve Boggan [https://www.independent.co.uk/news/conspiracies-abound-as-cole-quits-toughest-job-in-pr-1145917.html "Conspiracies abound as Cole quits `toughest job in PR '"], ''The Independent'', 21 February 1998&lt;/ref&gt; although Cole's PR work for Al-Fayed did not cease in 1998.

Hamilton lost a subsequent libel action against Al-Fayed in December 1999&lt;ref name="Wells"&gt;Matt Wells, et al [https://www.theguardian.com/uk/1999/dec/22/hamiltonvalfayed.conservatives "A greedy, corrupt liar"], ''The Guardian'', 22 December 1999&lt;/ref&gt; and a subsequent appeal against the verdict in December 2000.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2000/dec/21/hamiltonvalfayed "Neil Hamilton loses libel appeal"], theguardian.com. 21 December 2000&lt;/ref&gt; The former MP has always denied that he was paid by Al-Fayed for asking questions in parliament. Hamilton's libel action related to a [[Channel 4]] ''[[Dispatches (TV series)|Dispatches]]'' documentary broadcast on 16 January 1997&lt;ref&gt;[https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm199798/cmselect/cmstnprv/030ii/sp0157.htm "Appendix 33 – continued: Appendix 1 Channel 4 and Fourth Estate Press Releases"], Select Committee on Standards and Privileges First Report, House of Commons, January 1997&lt;/ref&gt; in which Al-Fayed made claims that the MP had received up to £110,000 in cash and received other gratuities for asking parliamentary questions.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/573630.stm "Hamilton loses libel case"], BBC News, 21 December 1999&lt;/ref&gt; Hamilton's basis for his appeal was that the original verdict was invalid because Al-Fayed had paid £10,000 for documents stolen from the dustbins of Hamilton's legal representatives by [[Benjamin Pell]],&lt;ref&gt;Steven Moss [https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2000/dec/12/hamiltonvalfayed.stevenmorris "Fayed 'paid for stolen papers'"], ''The Guardian'', 12 December 2000&lt;/ref&gt; also known as 'Benjy the Binman'.

In 2003, Fayed moved from [[Surrey]], UK to [[Switzerland]], alleging a breach in an agreement with [[Inland Revenue]]. In 2005, he moved back to [[United Kingdom|Britain]], saying that he "regards Britain as home".&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"/&gt; He moored a yacht in [[Monaco]] called the ''[[Sokar (yacht)|Sokar]]'' prior to selling it in 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://holiday.monacoeye.com/monaco_yacht_show.php|title=Monaco Yacht Show |publisher=Holiday|accessdate=22 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sale of Harrods===
After previously denying that Harrods was for sale, Harrods was sold to [[Qatar Investment Authority|Qatar Holdings]], the [[sovereign wealth fund]] of the emirate of [[Qatar]], on 10 May 2010. A fortnight previously, Fayed had stated that "People approach us from Kuwait, Saudi Arabia, Qatar. Fair enough. But I put two fingers up to them. It is not for sale. This is not Marks and Spencer or Sainsbury's. It is a special place that gives people pleasure. There is only one Mecca."&lt;ref name="Independent"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/middle-east/qatar-the-tiny-gulf-state-that-bought-the-world-1970551.html |title=Qatar, the tiny gulf state that bought the world|newspaper=The Independent|date=11 May 2010|accessdate=22 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Harrods was sold for £1.5 billion. Fayed later revealed in an interview that he decided to sell Harrods following the difficulty in getting his [[dividend]] approved by the trustee of the Harrods pension fund. Fayed said "I'm here every day, I can't take my profit because I have to take a permission of those bloody idiots. I say is this right? Is this logic? Somebody like me? I run a business and I need to take bloody fucking trustee's permission to take my profit".&lt;ref name="The Evening Standard"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thisislondon.co.uk/standard/article-23838358-a-four-letter-farewell-from-mohammed-fayed.do|title=Mohammed Fayed: Why I Sold Harrods|publisher=London Evening Standard|date=26 May 2010|accessdate=22 August 2010|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100701144627/http://www.thisislondon.co.uk/standard/article-23838358-a-four-letter-farewell-from-mohammed-fayed.do|archivedate=1 July 2010|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fayed was appointed honorary chairman of Harrods, a position he was scheduled to hold for at least six months.&lt;ref name="The Evening Standard"/&gt;

===Scotland===
In 1972, Fayed purchased the Balnagown estate in [[Easter Ross]], Northern [[Scotland]]. From an initial twelve acres, Al-Fayed has since built the estate up to sixty-five thousand acres.&lt;ref name="highland-jetset"&gt;{{Cite news|date=4 July 2005|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/this-britain/alfayed-to-fill-highland-estate-with-jetset-homes-497551.html|title=Al-Fayed to fill Highland estate with jet-set homes|newspaper=The Independent|location=London|first=Paul|last=Kelbie}}&lt;/ref&gt; Al-Fayed has invested more than £20 million in the estate, restored the 14th century pink [[Balnagown Castle]], and created a tourist accommodation business.&lt;ref name="highland-jetset"/&gt; The Highlands of Scotland tourist board awarded Al-Fayed the "Freedom of the Highlands" in 2002, in recognition of his "outstanding contribution and commitment to the highlands."

As an Egyptian with links to Scotland, Al-Fayed was intrigued enough to fund a 2008 reprint of the 15th-century chronicle ''[[Scotichronicon]]'' by [[Walter Bower]]. The ''Scotichronicon'' describes how Scota, a sister of the Egyptian Pharaoh [[Tutankhamen]], fled her family and landed in Scotland, bringing with her the [[Stone of Scone]]. According to the chronicle, Scotland was later named in her honour. The tale is disputed by modern historians.&lt;ref name="fayed-princess"&gt;{{Cite news|date=19 May 2008|url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/article3965279.ece|title=Al Fayed, a Princess and another theory the establishment denies|newspaper=The Times|location=London|first=Mike|last=Wade}}&lt;/ref&gt; Al-Fayed later declared that "The Scots are originally Egyptians and that's the truth."&lt;ref name="make-ruler"&gt;{{Cite news|date=25 October 2009|url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/uk/scotland/article6889088.ece|title=Forget Salmond: Make me your ruler|newspaper=The Times|location=London|first=Marc|last=Horne}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2009, Al-Fayed revealed that he was a supporter of [[Scottish independence]] from the United Kingdom, announcing to the Scots that "It's time for you to waken up and detach yourselves from the English and their terrible politicians...whatever help is needed for Scotland to regain its independence, I will provide it...when you Scots regain your freedom, I am ready to be your president."&lt;ref name="make-ruler"/&gt;

===Charity===
Fayed set up the Al Fayed Charitable Foundation in 1987 aiming to help children with life-limiting conditions and children living in poverty. The charity works mainly with charities and hospices for disabled and neglected children in the UK, Thailand and Mongolia.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.the-acf.com/who-we-are.aspx|title=Who we are - The AlFayed Charitable Foundation - ACF|website=www.the-acf.com|access-date=11 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Some of the charities with which it works include Francis House Hospice in Manchester, Great Ormond Street Hospital and ChildLine. In 1998, Al Fayed bought [[Princess Diana]]'s old boarding school in Kent and helped found the New School at West Heath for traumatised children there.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thirdsector.co.uk/news/620770/charitable-side-Mohamed-Al-Fayed/?HAYILC=RELATED |title=The charitable side of ...

In 2011, Mohamed Al-Fayed's daughter Camilla, who has worked as an ambassador for the charity for eight years,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/news/liverpool-news/heiress-camilla-al-fayed-liverpool-3010791 |title=Heiress Camilla Al Fayed on why Liverpool babies’ hospice Zoe’s Place is an inspiration|publisher=Liverpool Echo|accessdate=28 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; opened the newly refurbished Zoe’s Place baby hospice in West Derby, Liverpool.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.liverpooldailypost.co.uk/liverpool-news/regional-news/2011/09/09/camilla-al-fayed-opens-newly-refurbished-zoe-s-place-baby-hospice-in-west-derby-99623-29389925/ |title=Camilla Al Fayed opens newly refurbished Zoe’s Place baby hospice in West Derby |publisher=Liverpool Daily Post|accessdate=28 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Fulham F.C.===
{{Main|Fulham F.C.#1997–2001: Al Fayed takeover}}

Al-Fayed bought the [[Freehold (law)|freehold]] of West London professional football club [[Fulham F.C.]] for £6.25 million in 1997.&lt;ref name="fulham-pushed"&gt;{{Cite news|date=7 February 2003|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/2395783/Fulham-pushed-out-Hill.html|title=Fulham pushed out Hill|newspaper=The Daily Telegraph|location=London|first=Mihir|last=Bose}}&lt;/ref&gt; The club was purchased via Bill Muddyman's Muddyman Group.&lt;ref name="fulham-pushed"/&gt; His long-term aim was that Fulham would become a [[FA Premier League]] side within five years. In 2001, Fulham took the First Division (now [[Football League Championship]]) under manager [[Jean Tigana]], winning 100 points and scoring over 100 goals in the season. This meant that Al-Fayed had achieved his objective of Fulham becoming a Premier League club a year ahead of schedule. By 2002, Fulham were competing in European football, winning the [[Intertoto Cup]] and challenging in the [[UEFA Cup]]. Fulham reached the final of the [[2009–10 UEFA Europa League]] and continued to play in the Premier League throughout Al-Fayed's tenure as owner (which ended in 2013).

Fulham temporarily left [[Craven Cottage]] while it was being upgraded to meet modern safety standards. There were fears that Fulham would not return to the Cottage after it was revealed that Al-Fayed had sold the first right to build on the ground to a property development firm.&lt;ref name="future-hangs"&gt;{{cite news|title=Fulham's future hangs in balance|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/f/fulham/3084328.stm|work=BBC Sport|date=15 September 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Fulham lost a legal case against former manager Tigana in 2004 after Al-Fayed had wrongly alleged that Tigana had overpaid more than £7m for new players and had negotiated transfers in secret.&lt;ref name="fulham-lose"&gt;{{cite news|title=Fulham lose Tigana court battle|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/f/fulham/4005735.stm|newspaper=BBC|date=12 November 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2009, Al-Fayed said that he was in favour of a wage cap for footballers, and criticised the management of [[The Football Association]] and [[Premier League]] as "run by donkeys who don't understand business, who are dazzled by money."&lt;ref name="sport-quotes"&gt;{{Cite news|date=29 April 2009|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/funny_old_game/8024421.stm|title=Sport quotes of the week|work=BBC Sport|first=Chris|last=Charles}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A statue of the American entertainer [[Michael Jackson]] was unveiled by Al-Fayed in April 2011 at Craven Cottage In 1999 Jackson had attended a league game against [[Wigan Athletic F.C.|Wigan Athletic]] at the stadium. Following criticisms of the statue, Al-Fayed said "If some stupid fans don't understand and appreciate such a gift this guy gave to the world they can go to hell. I don't want them to be fans."&lt;ref name="jackson-fulham"&gt;{{Cite news|date=3 April 2011

Under Al-Fayed Fulham F.C. was owned by Mafco Holdings, based in the [[tax haven]] of [[Bermuda]]. Mafco Holdings is owned by Al-Fayed and his family. By 2011, Al-Fayed had loaned Fulham F.C. £187 million in interest free loans.&lt;ref name="record-losses"&gt;{{Cite news|date=19 May 2010 |url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2011/may/19/premier-league-finances-black-hole?INTCMP=SRCH|title=Record income but record losses for Premier League|newspaper=The Guardian|location=London|first=David|last=Conn}}&lt;/ref&gt; In July 2013, it was announced that Al-Fayed had sold the club to Pakistani American businessman [[Shahid Khan]], who owns the [[National Football League|NFL]]'s [[Jacksonville Jaguars]].&lt;ref name="Fulham Sold"&gt;{{cite news|title=Al-Fayed sells Fulham to Shahid Khan|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/23297785|publisher=BBC Sport|date=12 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Romance with Diana, Princess of Wales===
[[Diana, Princess of Wales|Lady Diana Spencer]] was born in 1961, and married the [[Line of succession to the British throne|heir to the British throne]], [[Charles, Prince of Wales]], in 1981, becoming the Princess of Wales. Diana was an international celebrity and a frequent visitor to Harrods in the 1980s. Al-Fayed and Dodi first met Diana and Charles when they were introduced at a [[polo]] tournament in July 1986, that had been sponsored by Harrods.&lt;ref name = HighBeam1&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P2-740497.html|title=Diana's Life on Display: Sometimes Storybook, Sometimes Soap Opera |author=David van Drehle |publisher=''[[The Washington Post]]'' |date=31 August 1997 |accessdate=11 October 2013}} ([[HighBeam Research]] subscription required)&lt;/ref&gt;

Diana and Charles divorced in 1996. Diana was hosted by Al-Fayed in the south of France in the summer of 1997, with her two sons, the Princes [[Prince William, Duke of Cambridge|William]] and [[Prince Harry|Harry]].&lt;ref name = HighBeam2&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P2-13112834.html|title=Coroner at Diana inquest dismisses all the conspiracy theories over fatal car crash Mohamed al-Fayed expresses surprise over the tone and content of remarks he says should be left to the jury to consider |author=Stephen McGinty |publisher=''[[The Scotsman]]'' |date=3 October 2007 |accessdate=11 October 2013}} ([[HighBeam Research]] subscription required)&lt;/ref&gt; For the holiday, Fayed bought a 195&amp;nbsp;ft yacht, the ''Jonikal'' (later renamed the ''[[Sokar (yacht)|Sokar]]'').&lt;ref name="vanfair"&gt;{{cite web|date=19 May 2010 |url=http://www.vanityfair.com/culture/features/2008/05/dunne200805|title=Two Ladies, Two Yachts, and a Billionaire|newspaper=''[[Vanity Fair (magazine)]]''|location=New York|author=[[Dominick Dunne]]|accessdate=11 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Dodi and Diana later began a private cruise on the ''Jonikal'' and [[paparazzi]] photographs of the couple in an embrace were published. Diana's friend, the journalist Richard Kay, confirmed that Diana was involved in "her first serious romance" since her divorce.&lt;ref name = HighBeam3&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P2-4409051.html|title=Di and Dodi's short summer |publisher=''[[Chicago Sun-Times]]'' |date=7 September 1997 |accessdate=11 October 2013}} ([[HighBeam Research]] subscription required)&lt;/ref&gt;

Dodi and Diana went on a second private cruise on the ''Jonikal'' in the third week of August, and returned from Sardinia to Paris on 30 August. The couple privately dined at the Ritz later that day, after the behaviour of the press caused them to cancel a restaurant reservation, they then planned to spend the night at Dodi's apartment near the [[Arc de Triomphe]].&lt;ref name="bbc-final"&gt;{{Cite news|date=14 December 2006|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/6219252.stm|title=Diana and Dodi: Their final hours|work=BBC News Online}}&lt;/ref&gt; In an attempt to deceive the paparazzi, a decoy car left the front of the hotel, while Diana and Dodi departed at speed in a [[Mercedes-Benz W140]] driven by chauffeur [[Henri Paul]] from the rear of the hotel.&lt;ref name="bbc-final"/&gt; Five minutes later, the car crashed in the [[Pont de l'Alma]] tunnel, killing Paul and Dodi. Diana died later in hospital. Fayed arrived in Paris the next day and viewed Dodi's body, which was returned to Britain for an [[Islamic funeral]].&lt;ref name="bbc-final"/&gt;&lt;ref name = HighBeam5&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-64636402.html|title=Fayed Is Buried After Quiet Islamic Tribute |publisher=''[[Seattle Post-Intelligencer]]'' |date=1 September 1997 |accessdate=11 October 2013}} ([[HighBeam Research]] subscription required)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Conspiracy theories===
From February 1998, Al-Fayed maintained that the crash was a result of a conspiracy,&lt;ref name="diana-crash"&gt;{{Cite news|date=12 February 1998|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/55800.stm|title=Diana crash was a conspiracy – Al Fayed|work=BBC News Online}}&lt;/ref&gt; and later contended that the crash was orchestrated by [[Secret Intelligence Service|MI6]] on the instructions of [[Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh]].&lt;ref name="point-claims"&gt;{{Cite news|date=19 February 1998|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/55800.stm|title=Point-by-point: Al Fayed's claims|work=BBC News Online}}&lt;/ref&gt; His claims that the crash was a result of a conspiracy were dismissed by a French judicial investigation, but Fayed appealed against this verdict. A libel action was brought against Al-Fayed by Neil Hamilton (see above). During the questioning of one day of the hearing, which referred to Al-Fayed's conspiracy theories, writer Martyn Gregory and a journalist from [[ITN]] counted 70 instances of Al-Fayed saying "I don't know" or "I can't remember" to questions relating to the tragedy.&lt;ref&gt;Martyn Gregory "How Fayed is Paying For His Diana Lies", ''The Spectator'', 8 January 2000&lt;/ref&gt;

The British [[Operation Paget]], a [[Metropolitan police]] inquiry that concluded in 2006, also found no evidence of a conspiracy.&lt;ref name="diana-tragic"&gt;{{Cite news|date=14 December 2006|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/6179275.stm|title=Diana death a 'tragic accident'|work=BBC News Online}}&lt;/ref&gt; To Operation Paget, Al-Fayed made 175 "conspiracy claims".&lt;ref&gt;Martyn Gregory [https://www.independent.co.uk/voices/commentators/martyn-gregory-alfayed-cant-rewrite-the-death-of-diana-394391.html "Al-Fayed can't rewrite the death of Diana"], ''The Independent'', 7 October 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

An inquest headed by [[Scott Baker (judge)|Lord Justice Scott Baker]] into the deaths of Diana and Dodi began at the [[Royal Courts of Justice]], London, on 2 October 2007 and lasted for six months. It was a continuation of the original inquest that had begun in 2004.&lt;ref name="inquests"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.scottbaker-inquests.gov.uk/faq/index.htm |archive-url=http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20080521144222/http://www.scottbaker-inquests.gov.uk/faq/index.htm |dead-url=yes |archive-date=21 May 2008 |title=Inquests into the deaths of Diana, Princess of Wales and Mr Dodi Al Fayed: FAQs |accessdate=4 June 2010 |year=2008 |work=Coroner's Inquests into the Deaths of Diana, Princess of Wales and Mr Dodi Al Fayed |publisher=Judicial Communications Office}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the Scott Baker inquest Fayed accused the [[Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh|Duke of Edinburgh]], the [[Charles, Prince of Wales|Prince of Wales]], [[Lady Sarah McCorquodale]], her sister, and numerous others, of plotting to kill the Princess of Wales.&lt;ref&gt;Stephen Bates [https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2008/feb/19/diana.monarchy "They're all guilty? 'Definitely.' Fayed gets his day in court"], ''The Guardian'', 19 February 2008&lt;/ref&gt; Their motive, he claimed, was that they could not tolerate the idea of the Princess marrying a Muslim.&lt;ref name="theguardian.com"&gt;Angela Balakrishnan [https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2008/apr/07/diana.monarchy1 "Pregnancy rumours, MI6 plots and Henri Paul"], theguardian.com, 7 April 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

Al-Fayed first claimed that the Princess was pregnant to the ''[[Daily Express]]'' in May 2001,&lt;ref name="theguardian.com"/&gt; and that he was the only person who had been told of this news. Witnesses at the inquest who said the Princess was not pregnant, and could not have been, were part of the conspiracy according to Al-Fayed.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/7250002.stm "Diana murdered, Al Fayed claims"], BBC News, 18 February 2008&lt;/ref&gt; Fayed's testimony at the inquest was roundly condemned in the press as being farcical. Members of the British Government's [[Intelligence and Security Committee]] accused Fayed of turning the inquest into a 'circus' and called for it to be ended maturely.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/7256665.stm|work=BBC News|title=Coroner warning in Diana inquest|date=21 February 2008| accessdate=13 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lawyers representing Al-Fayed later accepted at the inquest that there was no direct evidence that either the Duke of Edinburgh or MI6 had been involved in any murder conspiracy involving Diana or Dodi.&lt;ref name="fayed-collapses"&gt;{{Cite news|date=7 April 2008|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/7326311.stm|title=Fayed conspiracy claim collapses|work=BBC News Online}}&lt;/ref&gt; A few days before Al-Fayed's appearance, John Macnamara, a former senior detective at Scotland Yard and Al-Fayed's investigator for five years from 1997, was forced to admit on 14 February 2008 that he had no evidence to suggest foul play, except for the assertions Al-Fayed had made to him.&lt;ref name="Bates1502"&gt;Stephen Bates [https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2008/feb/15/monarchy "Diana conspiracy theory unravels as Fayed's investigator tells of lies and lack of evidence"], ''The Guardian'', 15 February 2008&lt;/ref&gt; His admissions also related to the lack of evidence for Al-Fayed's claims about the alleged pregnancy of the Princess and the couple's supposed engagement.&lt;ref name="Bates1502"/&gt;

The jury verdict, given on 7 April 2008, was that Diana and Dodi had been "[[unlawful killing|unlawfully killed]]" through the [[Gross negligence|grossly negligent]] driving of chauffeur [[Henri Paul]],&lt;ref name=verdict&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.scottbaker-inquests.gov.uk/hearing_transcripts/verdict.htm | archive-url=http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20080521144222/http://www.scottbaker-inquests.gov.uk/hearing_transcripts/verdict.htm | dead-url=yes | archive-date=21 May 2008 |title=Hearing transcripts: 7&amp;nbsp;April 2008 – Verdict of the jury|publisher=Judicial Communications Office|accessdate=15 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; who was [[Alcohol intoxication|intoxicated]], and the pursuing vehicles.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news | title=Diana jury blames paparazzi and Henri Paul for her 'unlawful killing' | url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/1584160/Diana-jury-blames-paparazzi-and-Henri-Paul-for-her-unlawful-killing.html | accessdate=12 October 2013 | work=Daily Telegraph | date=7 April 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Lawyers for Al-Fayed also accepted that there was no evidence to support the assertion that Diana was illegally embalmed in order to cover up a pregnancy, a "pregnancy" that they accepted, could not be established by any medical evidence.&lt;ref name="fayed-collapses"/&gt; They also accepted that there was no evidence to support the assertion the French emergency and medical services had played any role in a conspiracy to harm Diana.&lt;ref name="fayed-collapses"/&gt; Following the Baker inquest, Al-Fayed said that he was abandoning his campaign to prove that Diana and Dodi were murdered in a conspiracy, and said that he would accept the verdict of the jury.&lt;ref name="fayed-abandons"&gt;{{Cite news|date=8 April 2008|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/7337789.stm|title=Al Fayed abandons Diana campaign|work=BBC News Online}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Al-Fayed financially supported ''[[Unlawful Killing (film)|Unlawful Killing]]'' (2011), a documentary film accused of presenting his version of events.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/film/cannes-film-festival/8513112/Unlawful-Killing-film-about-the-death-of-Diana-likens-Prince-Philip-to-Fred-West.html |title=Unlawful Killing: film about the death of Diana likens Prince Philip to Fred West|accessdate=11 May 2011|newspaper=The Daily Telegraph|location=London |first=Anita|last=Singh|date=13 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The film was not formally released as a result of legal problems.&lt;ref&gt;Ben Child [https://www.theguardian.com/film/2012/jul/05/princess-diana-documentary-unlawful-killing "Princess Diana documentary Unlawful Killing is shelved"], ''The Guardian'' (London), 5 July 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sexual harassment allegations==
Al-Fayed has been accused by multiple women of [[sexual harassment]] and assault.&lt;ref name="crossing-swords"&gt;{{Cite news |date=24 October 1998|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk/1998/oct/24/hamiltonvalfayed|title=Crossing swords with Mohamed|work=The Guardian|location=London|first=Henry|last=Porter}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Boggan"&gt;{{Cite news|last=Boggan|first=Steve|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/al-fayed-accused-harrods-boss-rejects-charges-of-lechery-and-bugging-1289749.html|title=Al Fayed Accused: Harrods boss rejects charges of lechery and bugging|work=The Independent|location=London |date=20 December 1997}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Young women applying for employment at Harrods were often submitted to [[HIV test]]s and gynaecological examinations.&lt;ref name="Bower271–72"&gt;{{cite book|last=Bower|first=Tom |title=Fayed: The Unauthorized Biography|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ygLDIAAACAAJ|year=1998|publisher=Macmillan|isbn=978-0-333-74554-0|page=271–72}}&lt;/ref&gt; These women were then selected to spend the weekend with Al-Fayed in Paris.&lt;ref name="Bower271–72"/&gt; In her profile of Al-Fayed for ''[[Vanity Fair (magazine)|Vanity Fair]]'', [[Maureen Orth]] described how according to former employees "Fayed regularly walked the store on the lookout for young, attractive women to work in his office. Those who rebuffed him would often be subjected to crude, humiliating comments about their appearance or dress...A dozen ex-employees I spoke with said that
Fayed would chase secretaries around the office and sometimes try to stuff money down women's blouses".&lt;ref name="maureen-orth"&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://maureenorth.com/2010/09/holy-war-at-harrods-mohamed-al-fayed/|title=Holy War at Harrods|work=Vanity Fair|date=1 September 1995}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1994, Hermina Da Silva quit her job as a nanny at Al-Fayed's home in [[Oxted]]. Da Silva had prepared accusations that she was sexually harassed by Al-Fayed,&lt;ref name="crossing-swords"/&gt; and she was subsequently arrested by detectives and held overnight in cells following a complaint of theft by an employee of Al-Fayeds. She was later released without charge after officers concluded she had not stolen anything. Al-Fayed eventually settled with her out of court, and she was awarded £12,000.&lt;ref name="crossing-swords"/&gt;

Al-Fayed was interviewed under caution by the [[Metropolitan Police]] after an allegation of sexual assault against a 15-year-old schoolgirl in October 2008. The case was dropped by the [[Crown Prosecution Service]], after they found that there was no realistic chance of conviction due to conflicting statements.&lt;ref name="no-charges"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/london/7894870.stm|title=No Sex Charges for Harrods Owner|work=BBC News|date=17 February 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 1997, the [[ITV (TV network)|ITV]] current affairs programme, ''The Big Story'' broadcast testimonies from a number of former Harrods employees who spoke of how women were routinely sexually harassed by Al-Fayed.&lt;ref name="Boggan"/&gt;

A December 2017 episode of Channel 4's ''[[Dispatches (TV series)|Dispatches]]'' programme alleged that Al-Fayed had sexually harassed three Harrods employees, and attempted to "groom" them. One of the women was aged 17 at the time. Cheska Hill-Wood, now in her 40s, waived her right to anonymity to be interviewed for the programme.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Mendick|first=Robert|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2017/12/08/mohamed-al-fayed-accused-harassing-17-year-old-harrods-employee/|title=Mohamed Al-Fayed accused of harassing 17-year-old Harrods' employee|work=The Daily Telegraph|date=8 December 2017|accessdate=5 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The programme alleged al-Fayed targeted young employees over a 13 year period.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Brown|first=David|url=https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/mohamed-al-fayed-accused-of-sexually-harassing-young-staff-688twtk2v|title=Mohamed Al Fayed accused of sexually harassing young staff|work=The Times|date=8 December 2017|accessdate=5 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="14204">'''Network Intelligence (NI)''' is a technology that builds on the concepts and capabilities of [[Deep Packet Inspection]] (DPI), [[Packet capture|Packet Capture]] and [[Business Intelligence]] (BI).  It examines, in real time,  [[Packet (information technology)|IP data packets]]  that cross [[Telecommunications network|communications networks]] by identifying the [[Communications protocols|protocols]] used and extracting packet content and [[metadata]] for rapid analysis of data relationships and communications patterns.  Also, sometimes referred to as Network Acceleration or piracy. 

NI is used as a middleware to capture and feed information to network operator applications for [[bandwidth management]], [[traffic shaping]], policy management, [[Convergent charging|charging and billing]] (including usage-based and content billing), [[service assurance]], [[revenue assurance]], market research mega panel analytics, [[lawful interception]] and cyber security.  It is currently being incorporated into a wide range of applications by vendors who provide technology solutions to [[Communications service provider|Communications Service Providers (CSPs)]], governments and large enterprises. NI extends network controls, business capabilities, security functions and data mining for new products and services needed since the emergence of [[Web 2.0]] and wireless [[3G]] and [[4G]] technologies.&lt;ref name=jschieve/&gt;&lt;ref name=partridge/&gt;&lt;ref name=bechetoile/&gt;&lt;ref name=sherrington/&gt;

== Background ==
The evolution and growth of [[Internet]] and [[wireless]] technologies offer possibilities for new types of products and services,&lt;ref name=sherrington/&gt;&lt;ref name=kishore/&gt; as well as opportunities for hackers and criminal organizations to exploit weaknesses and perpetrate [[Computer crime|cyber crime]].&lt;ref name=dee/&gt;&lt;ref name=messagelabs/&gt;&lt;ref name=bigdata/&gt; [[Network management|Network optimization]] and [[Network security|security]] solutions therefore need to address the exponential increases in IP traffic, methods of access, types of activity and volume of content generated.&lt;ref name=ironport/&gt;&lt;ref name=golson/&gt; Traditional DPI tools from established vendors have historically addressed specific network infrastructure applications such as [[bandwidth management]], [[Network performance|performance optimization]] and [[Quality of Service]] (QoS). 

DPI focuses on recognizing different types of IP traffic as part of a CSP’s infrastructure. NI provides more granular analysis. It enables vendors to create an information layer with metadata from IP traffic to feed multiple applications for more detailed and expansive visibility into network-based activity.

NI technology goes beyond traditional DPI, since it not only recognizes protocols but also extracts a wide range of valuable metadata. NI’s value-add to solutions traditionally based on DPI has attracted the attention of industry analysts who specialize in DPI market research. For example, [http://www.heavyreading.com Heavy Reading] now includes NI companies on its Deep Packet Inspection Semi-Annual Market Tracker.&lt;ref name=sherrington/&gt;

== Business Intelligence for data networks ==
In much the same way that BI technology synthesizes business application data from a variety of sources for business visibility and better decision-making, NI technology correlates network traffic data from a variety of data communication vehicles for network visibility, enabling better cyber security and IP services. With ongoing changes in communications networks and how information can be exchanged, people are no longer linked exclusively to physical subscriber lines. The same person can communicate in multiple ways – [[File Transfer Protocol|FTP]], [[Webmail]], [[Voice over Internet Protocol|VoIP]], [[instant messaging]], [[online chat]], [[blogs]], [[Social network service|social networks]] – and from different access points via desktops, laptops and mobile devices.

NI provides the means to quickly identify, examine and correlate interactions involving Internet users, applications, and protocols whether or not the protocols are [[Tunnelling protocol|tunneled]] or follow the [[OSI model]]. The technology enables a global understanding of network traffic for applications that need to correlate information such as who contacts whom, when, where and how, or who accesses what database, when, and the information viewed. When combined with traditional BI tools that examine service quality and customer care, NI creates a powerful nexus of subscriber and network data.

== Use in telecommunications ==
Telcos, [[Internet Service Provider|Internet Service Providers (ISPs)]] and [[Mobile network operator|Mobile Network Operators (MNOs)]] are under increasing competitive pressures to move to [[smart pipe]] business models. The cost savings and revenue opportunities driving smart pipe strategies also apply to [[Network Equipment Provider]]s, [[Independent software vendor|Software Vendors]] and [[Systems integrator|Systems Integrators]] that serve the industry.

Because NI captures detailed information from the hundreds of IP applications that cross mobile networks, it provides the required visibility and analysis of user demand to create and deliver differentiating services, as well as manage usage once deployed.

&lt;small&gt;NI as enabling technology for smart pipe applications&lt;/small&gt;

Customer metrics are especially important for telecom companies to understand consumer behaviors and create personalized IP services. NI enables faster and more sophisticated [[Audience measurement|Audience Measurement]], User Behavior Analysis, [[Market segment|Customer Segmentation]], and Personalized Services.

Real-time network metrics are equally important for companies to deliver and manage services. NI classifies protocols and applications from layers 2 through 7, generates metadata for communication sessions, and correlates activity between all layers, applicable for [[Optimization (computer science)|Bandwidth &amp; Resource Optimization]], [[Quality of service|Quality of Service (QoS)]], Content-Based Billing, [[Quality of experience|Quality of Experience (QoE)]], VoIP Fraud Monitoring and [[Regulatory compliance|Regulatory Compliance]].

== Use in cloud computing ==
The economics and deployment speed of [[cloud computing]] is fueling rapid adoption by companies and government agencies.&lt;ref name=higginbotham/&gt;&lt;ref name=idc/&gt;&lt;ref name=sullivan/&gt; Among concerns, however, are risks of [[information security]], [[e-discovery]], [[regulatory compliance]] and [[auditing]].&lt;ref name=sienkiewicz/&gt;&lt;ref name=schwartz/&gt;&lt;ref name=brodkin/&gt; NI mitigates the risks by providing [[Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS)]], [[Platform as a service|Platform as a Service (PaaS)]] and [[Software as a service|Software as a Service (SaaS)]] vendors with real-time [[situational awareness]] of network activity, and critical transparency to allay fears of potential customers. A vendor can demonstrate hardened network security to prevent [[Data leakage protection|Data Leakage]] or [[Data Theft]] and an irrefutable audit trail of all network transaction – communication and content – related to a customer’s account, assuming compliance to regulation and standards.

== Use in government ==
NI extracts and correlates information such as who contacts whom, when where and how, providing [[situational awareness]] for [[Lawful interception|Lawful Interception]] and [[Cyber security|Cyber Security]]. Real-time data capture, extraction and analysis allow security specialists to take preventive measures and protect network assets in real time as a complement post-mortem analysis after an attack.

== Use in business ==
Because NI combines real-time [[network monitoring]] with IP metadata extraction, it enhances the effectiveness of applications for [[Database security|Database Security]], [[Database audit|Database Auditing]] and Network Protection. The network visibility afforded by NI can also be used to build enhancements and next-generation solutions for [[Network performance management|Network Performance Management]], [[WAN optimization|WAN Optimization]], [[Customer experience management|Customer Experience Management]], [[Content filtering|Content Filtering]], and internal billing of networked applications.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7015">'''Operating leverage''' is a measure of how revenue growth translates into growth in [[operating income]].  It is a measure of [[Leverage (finance)|leverage]], and of how risky, or volatile, a company's operating income is.

==Definition==
There are various measures of operating leverage,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.westga.edu/~bquest/1998/leverage.html Operating and Financial leverage&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;
which can be interpreted analogously to [[financial leverage]].

===Costs===
One analogy is '''"fixed costs + variable costs = total costs ..similar to.. debt + equity = assets".''' This analogy is partly motivated because (for a given amount of debt) debt servicing is a fixed cost. This leads to two measures of operating leverage:

One measure is [[fixed costs]] to [[total costs]]:
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{\text{FC}}{\text{TC}}=\frac{\text{FC}}{\text{FC}+\text{VC}}&lt;/math&gt;
Compare to [[Debt to equity ratio|debt to value]], which is
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{\text{Debt}}{\text{Assets}}=\frac{\text{Debt}}{\text{Debt}+\text{Equity}}&lt;/math&gt;

Another measure is [[fixed costs]] to [[variable costs]]:
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{\text{FC}}{\text{VC}}&lt;/math&gt;
Compare to [[debt to equity ratio]]:
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{\text{Debt}}{\text{Equity}}&lt;/math&gt;

Both of these measures depend on sales: if the unit variable cost is constant, then as sales increase, operating leverage (as measured by fixed costs to total costs or variable costs) increases.

===Contribution===
[[Contribution margin]] is a measure of operating leverage: the higher the contribution margin is (the lower variable costs are as a percentage of total costs), the faster the profits increase with sales. Note that unlike other measures of operating leverage, in the linear [[Cost-Volume-Profit Analysis]] Model, contribution margin is a fixed quantity, and does not change with Sales.
Contribution  =  Sales - Variable Cost

===DOL and Operating income===
Operating leverage can also be measured in terms of change in [[operating income]] for a given change in sales (revenue).

The '''Degree of Operating Leverage''' (DOL) can be computed in a number of equivalent ways; one way it is defined as the ratio of the percentage change in Operating Income for a given percentage change in Sales {{harv|Brigham|1995|p=426}}:
:&lt;math&gt;\text{DOL} = \frac{\%\text{ change in Operating Income}}{\% \text{ change in Sales}}&lt;/math&gt;

This can also be computed as Total [[Contribution Margin]] over [[Operating Income]]:
:&lt;math&gt;\text{DOL} = \frac{\text{Total Contribution}}{\text{Operating Income}} = \frac{\text{Total Contribution}}{\text{Total Contribution} - \text{Fixed Costs}} = \frac{(\text{P}-\text{V})\cdot \text{X}}{(\text{P}-\text{V})\cdot \text{X} - \text{FC}}&lt;/math&gt;

The above equivalence follows as the relative change in operating income with one more unit dX equals the contribution margin divided by operating income while the relative change in sales with one more unit dX equals price divided by revenue (or, in other words, 1 / X with X being the quantity). 

Alternatively, as Contribution Margin Ratio over [[Operating Margin]]:
:&lt;math&gt;\text{DOL} = \frac{\text{Contribution Margin Ratio}}{\text{Operating Margin}}&lt;/math&gt;

For instance, if a company has sales of 1,000,000 units, at price $50, unit variable cost of $10, and fixed costs of $10,000,000, then its unit contribution is $40, its Total Contribution is $40m, and its Operating Income is $30m, so its DOL is
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{\$\text{40m}}{\$\text{30m}} = 1 \frac{1}{3} \approx 1.33&lt;/math&gt;
This could also be computed as 80%=$40m/$50m Contribution Margin Ratio divided by 60%=$30m/$50m Operating Margin.

It currently has Sales of $50m and Operating Income of $30m, so additional Unit Sales (say of 100,000 units) yield $5m more Sales and $4m more Operating Income: a 10% increase in Sales and a 10% &lt;math&gt;\times 1 \frac{1}{3}=&lt;/math&gt; 13{{fraction|1|3}}% increase in Operating Income.

Assuming the  model, for a given level of sales, the DOL is higher the higher fixed costs are ([http://moneyterms.co.uk/operational_gearing/ an example]): for a given level of sales and profit, a company with higher fixed costs has a lower Operating Income, and hence its Operating Income increases more rapidly with Sales than a company with lower fixed costs (and correspondingly lower contribution margin and higher Operating Income).

If a company has no fixed costs (and hence breaks even at zero), then its DOL equals 1: a 10% increase in Sales yields a 10% increase in Operating Income, and its [[operating margin]] equals its  [[contribution margin]]:
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{\text{Operating Income}}{\text{Sales}}=\frac{\text{Unit Price} - \text{Unit Variable Cost}}{\text{Unit Price}}&lt;/math&gt;

DOL is highest near the [[break-even point]]; in fact, at the break-even point, DOL is undefined, because it is infinite: an increase of 10% in sales, say, increases Operating Income for 0 to some positive number (say, $10), which is an infinite (or undefined) percentage change; in terms of margins, its Operating Margin is zero, so its DOL is undefined.
Similarly, for a very small positive Operating Income (say, $.1), a 10% increase in sales may increase Operating Income to $10, a 100x (or 9,900%) increase, for a DOL of 990; in terms of margins, its Operating Margin is very small, so its DOL is very large.

DOL is closely related to the rate of increase in the [[operating margin]]: as sales increase past the break-even point, operating margin rapidly increases from 0% (reflected in a high DOL), and as sales increase, asymptotically approaches the contribution margin: thus the rate of change in operating margin decreases, as does the DOL, which asymptotically approaches 1.

==Industry-specific==
Examples of companies with high operating leverage include companies with high R&amp;D costs, such as pharmaceuticals: it can cost billions to develop a drug, but then pennies to produce it. Hence from a [[Whole-life cost|life cycle cost analysis]] perspective, the ratio of preproduction costs (e.g. design widgets) versus incremental production costs (e.g. produce a widget) is a useful measure of operating leverage.

===Outsourcing===
[[Outsourcing]] a product or service is a method used to change the ratio of [[fixed costs]] to [[variable costs]] in a business.  Outsourcing can be used to change the balance of this ratio by offering a move from fixed to variable cost and also by making variable costs more predictable.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2230">In [[Business law|business or commercial law]] in certain [[common law]] jurisdictions, an '''ordinary resolution''' is a [[Resolution (law)|resolution]] passed by the [[stockholder|shareholders]] of a [[company (law)|company]] by a [[majority|simple or bare majority]] (for example more than 50% of the vote) either at a convened meeting of shareholders or by circulating a resolution for signature. A [[special resolution]] by comparison requires a greater vote threshold, which varies in different [[jurisdictions]].

An ordinary resolution is the most common method by which a corporate entity conducts its business or the [[board of directors]] seeks shareholder approval of its actions.

The prevailing [[legislation]] applying to companies in the relevant jurisdiction will usually prescribe certain activities which ''must be'' approved by special resolution or alternatively which ''cannot be'' approved by ordinary resolution (for example altering the company's [[Company (law)#Corporate constitution|constitutional documents]], reducing the [[share capital]] or dissolving the company). In addition, in certain circumstances a company may wish to amend its constitution to increase the threshold to provide that a special resolution needs to be passed prior to the company engaging in other matters which may ordinarily approved by simple majority, purely as a matter of internal organisational control.

[[File:File-Water droplet at DWR-coated surface1.jpg|thumb|300px|Release agents often produce low [[surface energy]] and a high [[contact angle]].]]
A '''release agent''' (also mold release agent, release coating, or mold release coating) is a [[chemical]] used to prevent other materials from bonding to surfaces. It can provide a solution in processes involving [[Mould (casting)|mold]] release, [[Die casting|die-cast]] release, [[plastic]] release, [[adhesive]] release, and [[tire]] and [[Web (manufacturing)|web]] release. 

Release agents provide the critical barrier between a molding surface and the substrate, facilitating separation of the cured part from the mold. Without such a barrier in place, the substrate would become fused to the mold surface, resulting in difficult clean-up and dramatic loss in production efficiency. Even when a release agent is used, factors such as irregular applications or improper release agent choice may have a dramatic effect on the quality and consistency of the finished product.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Mold Release Agent: Which is right for you?|url=https://www.miller-stephenson.com/mold-release-agent/|website=Miller-Stephenson Chemical Co.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Types of Release Agents ==
{{unsourced|section|date=October 2018}}

=== Semi-Permanent ===
One of the key attributes of a release agent is its degree of permanence: how long will it last before reapplication is necessary. A semi-permanent release agent does not need to be reapplied for every cycle of a molding operation and even works better when it is not over-applied to the mold surface. 

How many releases can be achieved before reapplication is necessary varies by process, material, and application method. In order to achieve multiple releases per application, the semi-permanent release coating generally must  be applied to a clean, dry surface free of dirt, rust, grime or previous coatings. This allows the release agent to properly bond to the mold and mold tooling, improving durability and longevity of the coating.

=== Sacrificial ===
Sacrificial coatings must be applied before every cycle of a molding operation and are therefore considered more labor intensive. Most molders will prefer semi-permanent coatings to sacrificial coatings, especially when molding rubber and plastic parts. These coatings are contain fewer solid ingredients, and thus do not last as long as semi-permanent coatings.

=== Water or Solvent-based ===
Release agents may be water or solvent-based and use of either will depend on the personal preference of the molder, plant safety regulations, hazardous materials shipping costs, state, local, or federal regulations, and/or desired drying times of the release coating. 

==== Water-based ====
Water-based release coatings generally dry slower than solvent-based release agents but present fewer health and safety concerns. Water-based release agents will be less expensive to ship because of their inherently non-flammable nature and satisfy most plant-safety goals.

===== Solvent-based =====
Solvent-based release coatings dry almost instantly but present serious health and safety concerns. Fumes from solvent-based release agents may be hazardous without proper ventilation of the work area. Most solvents used in release agents are flammable.  

===== Non-flammable Solvents =====
Non-flammable release agents are available and usually classified as [[Combustibility and flammability|combustible]].

==Applications==

===Asphalt===
Asphalt Release Agents are chemical products developed and manufactured as alternatives to diesel and solvents commonly used for cleaning equipment associated with  Hot Mix Asphaltic Concrete (HMAC) production and placement on government and private facilities. The United States Oil Pollution Act of 1980 was used as the foundation to build the current program. The intent of asphalt release agents is to eliminate harmful stripping products that come into contact with bituminous products and strip the asphalt (binding agent) from the aggregates causing potholes, raveling, and other detrimental pavement failures.
===Concrete===
In the [[concrete]] construction industry, form release agents prevent the adhesion of freshly placed concrete to the forming surface, usually [[plywood]], overlaid plywood, [[steel]] or [[aluminum]].  In this application, there are two types of release agents available:  barrier and reactive.

'''Barrier release agents''' prevent [[adhesion]] by the development of a physical [[film]] or barrier between the forming surface and the concrete.

'''Reactive release agents''' are chemically active and work by the process of a [[chemical reaction]] between the release agent and the free [[lime (material)|lime]]s available in fresh concrete.  A soapy film is created which prevents adhesion.  Because it is a chemically reactive process, there is generally little to no residue or non-reacted product left on the forming surface or concrete which provides for a cleaner process.

===Food processing===
Release agents are used to aid in the separation of [[food]] from a cooking container after [[baking]] or [[roasting]]. Traditionally [[fat]] or [[flour]] have been used, but in industrial food processing other chemicals might be used. The application is called bakery release.

In [[bakery paper]] or [[greaseproof paper]] release agents like [[catalyst]]-cured [[silicone]] release coatings may be used.

===Paper===
In industrial [[papermaking]] release agents are used to get slip effect of the paper from the processing equipment. A release agent may be applied on the process rolls (like the [[yankee dryer]]) or in the [[paper coating]].

Some [[paper]] types are made with low [[Surface energy]]  release coatings:
*[[Release liner]]s for pressure-sensitive adhesive laminates and tapes
*Casting papers
*General industrial release papers
*Food-grade release and packaging papers

===Pharmaceuticals===
Release agents (e.g., [[magnesium stearate]]) are added to powdered and granulated drug compositions, to serve as a lubricant for mold release purposes during tabletting.

===Plastics===
Release agents are coated onto some [[plastic film]]s to prevent adhesives from bonding to the plastic surface.  Some release agents, also known as de-molding agent, form oil, parting agent or form releaser, are substances used in [[Molding (process)|molding]] and [[casting]] that aid in the separation of a mould from the material being moulded and reduce imperfections in the moulded surface.

===Rubber===
There are two types of release agents used in the molding of rubber products. Both are [[silicone]] based. The decision on which to use has to do with lubricity and release.  Water-diluted silicon is used when you have rubber sliding over a hot mold (sheets or slugs). The silicon keeps the rubber from sticking to the mold but just as important it lubricates the rubber so it will slide over the hot mold as it is loaded. Diluted silicon typically has to be applied every cycle.  Semi-permanent mold release builds a silicon matrix on the mold that becomes a barrier between the rubber and the metal surface of the mold. The matrix is created by the other ingredients in the semi-permanent mold release. Applications of semi-permanent mold release vary from every cycle to once daily applications depending on the compound being molded and the design and quality of the mold. Silicone-based rubber products, however, require a non-silicone based releasing agent.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="13210">'''Relu Fenechiu''' (born July 3, 1965) is a [[Romania]]n businessman and former politician. A former member of the [[National Liberal Party (Romania)|National Liberal Party]] (PNL), he was a member of the [[Chamber of Deputies of Romania|Romanian Chamber of Deputies]] for [[Iaşi County]] from 2004 to 2014. In the [[Victor Ponta]] cabinet, he served as [[Ministry of Transport and Infrastructure|Transport Minister]] from 2012 to 2013. Convicted of corruption in 2013, he went to prison the following year.

==Biography==

He was born in [[Dărmănești]], [[Bacău County]], attending high school in [[Comănești]].&lt;ref name="capital"/&gt; In 1990, he graduated from the Mechanics Faculty of the [[Gheorghe Asachi Technical University of Iaşi]], specialising in the technology of building motor vehicles. He holds a 2006 degree from the [[Carol I National Defence University]] and a 2007 master's degree in Marketing from the [[Romanian-American University]]. In 2008, he took master's courses in Economics and Environmental Management at the [[Ecological University of Bucharest]].&lt;ref name="cvdeputat"/&gt; From 1990 to 2004, he directed Fene Grup S.A., a [[Iaşi]]-based group of construction firms.&lt;ref name="cvdeputat"&gt;{{ro icon}} [http://www.cdep.ro/pls/parlam/structura.mp?idm=108&amp;cam=2&amp;leg=2008&amp;pag=0&amp;idl=1 Curriculum vitae at the Romanian Chamber of Deputies site]; accessed November 2, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{ro icon}} [https://web.archive.org/web/20090303201530/http://www.fene.ro/sections/prezentare/?t_id=0p0 General Presentation], Fene Grup S.A. site; accessed November 2, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

Fenechiu joined the Iaşi PNL chapter in 1996, serving as its vice president from 1998 to 2000. He was vice president of the PNL's Iaşi County chapter from 2001 to 2004, and was its president from that time until 2014.&lt;ref name="cvdeputat"/&gt;&lt;ref name="predat"&gt;{{ro icon}} Cezar Pădurariu, [http://adevarul.ro/locale/iasi/relu-fenechiu-1_52ea7182c7b855ff56ef4b15/index.html "Fostul deputat şi-a anunţat demisia din PNL" ("Former Deputy Announces Resignation from PNL")], ''Adevărul'', 30 January 2014; accessed January 30, 2014&lt;/ref&gt; In 2001, he joined the party's delegation of national representatives, and became president of its committee on regional policy, land management and transport in 2002. Since 2007, he has sat on the PNL's central political bureau, responsible for its specialty committees. Fenechiu's first elected position was as an Iaşi County councillor, from 2000 to 2004. In 2004, he [[Romanian legislative election, 2004|was elected]] to the Chamber,&lt;ref name="cvdeputat"/&gt; being [[Romanian legislative election, 2008|re-elected in 2008]].&lt;ref&gt;{{ro icon}} [http://www.alegeri.tv/alegeri-parlamentare-uninominale-2008/aroneanu/159/colegiul-uninominal-2 Election results], alegeri.tv;  accessed November 2, 2009&lt;/ref&gt; During his first parliamentary term, he was deputy leader of the PNL group from December 2004 to September 2005, followed by a stint as president of the committee on public administration, land management and ecological balance. Additionally, from May 2007, he was on the joint committee for European affairs. In 2009, he rejoined the public administration committee, having been on the culture, arts and mass media committee from the start of his second term. Since that term began, he has been president of the information technology and communications committee. During both terms, he was part of the Romanian Parliament's delegation to the [[Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe]].&lt;ref&gt;{{ro icon}} [http://www.cdep.ro/pls/parlam/structura.mp?idm=171&amp;cam=2&amp;leg=2004&amp;pag=1&amp;idl=1 2004-2008 profile at the Romanian Chamber of Deputies site]; accessed November 2, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{ro icon}} [http://www.cdep.ro/pls/parlam/structura.mp?idm=108&amp;cam=2&amp;leg=2008&amp;pag=1&amp;idl=1 2008-2012 profile at the Romanian Chamber of Deputies site]; accessed November 2, 2009&lt;/ref&gt; Fenechiu was elected to yet another term [[Romanian legislative election, 2012|in 2012]],&lt;ref&gt;{{ro icon}} Ana-Maria Adamoae, Dan Istratie, [http://www.evz.ro/detalii/stiri/rezultate-alegeri-parlamentare-2012-iasi-1014888.html "Varujan Vosganian și Relu Fenechiu, din nou în Parlament" ("Varujan Vosganian and Relu Fenechiu, again in Parliament")], ''Evenimentul Zilei'', 10 December 2012; accessed July 12, 2013&lt;/ref&gt; being assigned to the industry committee,&lt;ref name="p2012"&gt;{{ro icon}} [http://www.cdep.ro/pls/parlam/structura.mp?idm=131&amp;cam=2&amp;leg=2012&amp;pag=1&amp;idl=1 2012- profile at the Romanian Chamber of Deputies site]; accessed February 17, 2014&lt;/ref&gt; and was named [[Ministry of Transport and Infrastructure|Minister of Transport]] in the [[Victor Ponta]] cabinet.&lt;ref&gt;{{ro icon}} Andrei Luca Popescu, [http://www.gandul.info/politica/relu-fenechiu-ministrul-transporturilor-in-guvernul-ponta-ii-de-la-fraude-cu-transformatoare-la-reteaua-drumurilor-nationale-10400117 "Relu Fenechiu, ministrul Transporturilor în Guvernul Ponta II, de la fraude cu transformatoare, la reţeaua drumurilor naţionale" ("Relu Fenechiu, Transport Minister in the Second Ponta Government, from Transformer Fraud to the National Road Network")], ''Gândul'', 19 December 2012; accessed July 12, 2013&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, from September 2013 to the following February, he headed the Chamber's European affairs committee.&lt;ref name="p2012"/&gt;

==History==
Following the failure of SBB's plans to strengthen the profitability and financial independence of its Cargo division by selling stakes to other international railway operators, SBB Cargo changed to an alternative solution. A new railway undertaking called SBB Cargo International was founded in partnership with intermodal transport operator [[Hupac]]. The new company focuses on block and intermodal trains on the European North-South corridor between [[Germany]] and [[Italy]]. The shareholders in the new company are SBB Cargo (75%) and Hupac (25%), with further partners possible in the future. The aim is to achieve cost leadership in the [[Intermodal freight transport|intermodal]] segment by optimising resources on selected routes and halving structural costs. The new company’s customers will primarily comprise intermodal operators, who will account for about 80% of the planned total sales of CHF 300 million.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.railwaygazette.com/nc/news/single-view/view/sbb-and-hupac-to-form-trans-alpine-freight-operator.html

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1556">'''Shop stewards''' are representatives of [[labour unions]]. Unlike other [[union representative|union representatives]], stewards work on the shop floor, connecting workers with union officials at regional or national levels.

The role of shop stewards may vary from being a mere representative of a larger national union towards independent structures with the power of collective bargaining on the workplace.

Both in [[Germany]] and [[United Kingdom|Britain]]{{fact|date=September 2017}} shop stewards were crucial{{fact|date=September 2017}} in antiwar protests during World War I. In Germany a network of shop stewards called [[Revolutionary Stewards]] took an important role in the revolutionary events of November 9 in Berlin.&lt;ref&gt;Ralf Hoffrogge, ''Working-Class Politics in the German Revolution.

'''Splash Corporation''' ([[Doing business as|d/b/a]] '''Splash''') is a [[Philippines|Filipino]] [[personal care]] and [[food]] company based in [[Bonifacio Global City]], [[Taguig]].

== History ==
Splash Corporation was founded in 1985 by Drs. Rolando and Rosalinda Hortaleza and incorporated as RBH Cosmetics, the company’s very first products were repackaged acetone and cuticle remover as just a backyard business when decided to invest their ₱12,000 cash gifts from their wedding.

In 1987, Hortaleza seeing a fad in growing hair-style decided to sell high-quality but affordable hair spray, letting the company earned its first one million peso in sales. The couple eventually renamed their company from Hortaleza Cosmetics to Splash Cosmetics.

In 1993, the Hortalezas were able to afford sophisticated technologies and it was renamed as Splash Manufacturing Corporation. In 1997, the Splash Research Institute was established complete with state-of-the-art facilities and equipment, and a research staff of more than 20 chemists, pharmacists and engineers. Its main purpose is to design and develop of innovative products and packaging systems. Splash tries to keep a two-year rolling pipeline of new products, backed by rigid clinical tests.

In 2001, Splash Manufacturing Corporation was renamed as Splash Corporation and in 2002, Splash invested in a ₱400 million state-of-the-art manufacturing complex in Canumay, [[Valenzuela, Philippines|Valenzuela]] which is expected to meet the company's capacity requirements in the medium-term. On November 15, 2007, the Splash’s shares of stocks were listed in the [[Philippine Stock Exchange]] under the stock symbol, SPH.

In 2009, the company made three major moves. P.T. Splash Cahaya was incorporated in Indonesia as part of company’s expansion overseas. On November, the company went into the direct selling business by launching the First Business Center. A month later, Splash established the Acceleron Distribution Corporation to distribute certain brands to large-scale supermarkets.

In 2011, Splash acquired Barrio Fiesta Manufacturing Corporation (BFMC) for ₱472 million to gain a foothold in the food industry through the Barrio Fiesta branded shrimp paste, recipe mixes and flavored vinegar.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.splash.com.ph/index.php/splash-acquires-barrio-fiesta-brand-for-p472m/ | title=Splash board approves P69-million spending budget for 2015 | publisher=Business World|date=December 19, 2014| accessdate=May 6, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2012, it acquired Moondish Corporation with its canned line of ready to eat canned products.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.philstar.com/business/2012/09/15/849102/splash-gobbles-another-food-firm | title=Splash gobbles up another food firm | publisher=[[The Philippine Star|philstar.com]] |date=September 14, 2012 | accessdate=April 18, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.rappler.com/business/13388-splash-expands-food-portfolio,-buys-moondish | title=Splash expands food portfolio, buys Moondish| publisher= [[Rappler]] | date=October 1, 2012 | accessdate=November 2, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As of December 2013, Splash Corporation, ranks fifth in the personal care industry, outranked only by giant multinationals and making the number one personal care company in the Philippines.
