      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4462">"'''A rose by any other name would smell as sweet'''" is a popular reference to [[William Shakespeare]]'s play ''[[Romeo and Juliet]]'', in which Juliet seems to argue that it does not matter that Romeo is from her family's rival house of Montague, that is, that he is named "Montague". The reference is often used to imply that the names of things do not affect what they really are. This formulation is, however, a paraphrase of Shakespeare's actual language. Juliet compares Romeo to a rose saying that if he were not named Romeo he would still be handsome and be Juliet's love. This states that if he were not Romeo, then he would not be a Montague and she would be able to get married with no problem at all.

==Origin==
In Act II, Scene II&lt;ref&gt;[http://shakespeare.mit.edu/romeo_juliet/romeo_juliet.2.2.html ''Romeo and Juliet''] on [[MIT]]'s website&lt;/ref&gt; of the play, the line is said by Juliet in reference to Romeo's house: [[Characters in Romeo and Juliet#House of Montague|Montague]]. The line implies that his name means nothing and they should be together. 

&lt;blockquote&gt;
'''Juliet:'''

O Romeo, Romeo! wherefore art thou Romeo?&lt;br/&gt;
Deny thy father and refuse thy name;&lt;br/&gt;
Or, if thou wilt not, be but sworn my love,&lt;br/&gt;
And I'll no longer be a Capulet

'''Romeo:'''

[Aside] Shall I hear more, or shall I speak at this?

'''Juliet:'''

'Tis but thy name that is my enemy;&lt;br/&gt;
Thou art thyself, though not a Montague.&lt;br/&gt;
What's Montague? It is nor hand, nor foot,&lt;br/&gt;
Nor arm, nor face, nor any other part&lt;br/&gt;
Belonging to a man. O, be some other name!&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;u&gt;What's in a name? That which we call a rose&lt;/u&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;u&gt;By any other word would smell as sweet&lt;/u&gt;;&lt;br/&gt;
So Romeo would, were he not Romeo call'd,&lt;br/&gt;
Retain that dear perfection which he owes&lt;br/&gt;
Without that title. Romeo, doff thy name,&lt;br/&gt;
And for that name which is no part of thee&lt;br/&gt;
Take all myself.

'''Romeo:'''

I take thee at thy word:&lt;br/&gt;
Call me but love, and I'll be new baptized;&lt;br/&gt;
Henceforth I never will be Romeo.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Original texts==
Although it is one of the most famous quotes from the work of Shakespeare, no printing in Shakespeare's lifetime presents the text in the form known to modern readers: it is a skillful amalgam assembled by [[Edmond Malone]], an editor in the eighteenth century. 

''Romeo and Juliet'' was published twice, in two very different versions. The first version of 1597, named "Q1", is believed to have been an unauthorised pirate copy or [[bad quarto]] provided to the printer by actors off the books: a [[memorial reconstruction]]. It may also, separately, represent a version of the play improved and trimmed after rehearsals for more dramatic impact.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Belsey|first1=Catherine|title=Romeo and Juliet Language and Writing.|date=2014|publisher=Bloomsbury Publishing|location=London|isbn=9781472539441}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It runs:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
’Tis but thy name that is mine enemy:&lt;br/&gt;
What’s Montague? It is not hand nor foot,&lt;br/&gt;
Nor arm, nor face, nor any other part.&lt;br/&gt;
What’s in a name? That which we call a rose,&lt;br/&gt;
By any other name would smell as sweet.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Q2, a superior 1599 printing, is believed to be a more official version printed from Shakespeare's original manuscript although perhaps not with Shakespeare's personal input. This is believed since there are textual oddities such as "false starts" for speeches that were presumably not clearly crossed out enough for the printer to spot.

It uses the text:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
’Tis but thy name that is my enemy:&lt;br/&gt;
Thou art thyself, though not a Montague,&lt;br/&gt;
What’s Montague? It is not hand nor foot,&lt;br/&gt;
Nor arm nor face. O be some other name,&lt;br/&gt;
belonging to a man!&lt;br/&gt;
What’s in a name? That which we call a rose,&lt;br/&gt;
By any other word would smell as sweet.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Malone reasoned that the awkward half-line of ‘belonging to a man’ could be reconnected into verse through correction with Q1. Modern editors have generally concurred.

An '''Archimedean point''' (or "Punctum Archimedis") is a hypothetical vantage point from which an observer can objectively perceive the subject of inquiry, with a view of totality.  The ideal of "removing oneself" from the object of study so that one can see it in relation to all other things, but remain independent of them, is described by a view from an Archimedean point.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.oxfordreference.com/view/10.1093/oi/authority.20110803095422175 Archimedean Point]. [[Oxford Reference - Oxford University Press]]. Retrieved 18 April 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;  For example, the philosopher [[John Rawls]] uses the [[heuristic]] device of the [[original position]] in an attempt to remove the particular [[biases]] of individual [[agency (philosophy)|agents]] in an attempt to demonstrate how [[Rational Choice Theory|rational beings]] might arrive at an [[objectivity (philosophy)|objective]] formulation of [[justice]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/communitarianism/#UniVerPar Communitarianism]. [[Stanford Encyclopaedia of Philosophy]]. Retrieved 15 February 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

The expression comes from [[Archimedes]], who supposedly claimed that he could lift the [[Earth]] off its foundation if he were given a place to stand, one solid point, and a long enough lever.  This is also mentioned in Descartes' second meditation with regard to finding certainty, the 'unmovable point' Archimedes sought.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Quotations about Archimedes Lever | url = http://www.math.nyu.edu/~crorres/Archimedes/Lever/LeverQuotes.html | accessdate = 2009-01-23| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20090126130558/http://www.math.nyu.edu/~crorres/Archimedes/Lever/LeverQuotes.html| archivedate= 26 January 2009 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Sceptical]] and [[anti-realist]] philosophers criticise the possibility of an Archimedean point, claiming it is a form of [[scientism]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.oxfordreference.com/view/10.1093/oi/authority.20110803095422175 Archimedean Point].

'''Attention restoration theory''' ('''ART''') asserts that people can [[attention|concentrate]] better after spending time in nature, or even looking at scenes of nature. Natural environments abound with "soft fascinations" which a person can reflect upon in "effortless attention", such as clouds moving across the sky, leaves rustling in a breeze or water bubbling over rocks in a stream. The theory was developed by [[Rachel and Stephen Kaplan]] in the 1980s in their book ''The experience of nature: A psychological perspective'',&lt;ref name="kaplan1989"&gt;{{cite book |last=Kaplan |first=R. |authorlink=Rachel and Stephen Kaplan |last2=Kaplan |first2=S. |year=1989 |title=The Experience of Nature: A Psychological Perspective |publisher=Cambridge University Press |isbn=0-521-34139-6 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7l80AAAAIAAJ}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="kaplan1995"&gt;The restorative benefits of nature: Toward an integrative framework. By Kaplan S. in Journal of Environmental Psychology 1995, v.15, pp169-182.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= Environmental Psychology, Fifth Edition |last=Bell |first=P.A. |last2=Greene |first2=T.C. |last3=Fisher |first3=J.D. |url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=tmGLFf1dUasC&amp;pg=PA49&amp;lpg=PA49 |isbn=978-0-8058-6088-7 |publisher=Harcourt College Publishers |year=2001}}&lt;/ref&gt; and has since been found by others to hold true in medical outcomes as well as intellectual task attention, as described below.  Berman et al. discuss the foundation of the attention restoration theory (ART).  "ART is based on past research showing the separation of attention into two components: involuntary attention, where attention is captured by inherently intriguing or important stimuli, and voluntary or directed attention, where attention is directed by cognitive-control processes." &lt;ref&gt;Berman, Mare G et al. "The Cognitive Benefits of Interacting with Nature", Psychological Science, Vol 19. Num 12. Michigan, 28 May 2008. Retrieved on 2012-09-16.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Restorative environments ==
Restoration or psychological restoration in the environmental psychology field is the recovery of depleted resources that can be psychological (attention and emotions), physiological (stress) and social, as a result of interaction with a restorative environment, to change negative states to positive ones.&lt;ref&gt;Hartig, T. (2004). Restorative environments. In C. Spielberger (Ed.), ''Encyclopedia of applied psychology'' (pp. 273–279). San Diego: Academic.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hartig, T. (2011). Issues in restorative environments research: Matters of measurement. In B. Fernández, C. Hidalgo, C. Salvador &amp; M. J. Martos (Eds.), ''Psicología Ambiental 2011: Entre los estudios urbanos y el análisis de la sostenibilidad'' (pp. 41-66). Almería, Spain: University of Almeria &amp; the Spanish Association of Environmental Psychology.&lt;/ref&gt; Psychological restoration can be described as the capability of perception of restoration, as an observer can perceive the properties of an environment that relieves the mental fatigue and stress in a person.&lt;ref&gt;Coles, R., &amp; Keshavarz, N. (2006). The restorative potential of local urban environments-The impact of green infrastructure on the health and well being of local residents. In K. Nilsson &amp; B. Nielsen (Eds.), ''Urban forestry for human health and wellbeing''. Documento presentado en la reunión COST-E39 Research Conference y ASEM Second Symposium on Urban Forestry, Copenhagen, Dinamarca.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Kaplans describes a series of characteristics that an environment must have to be restorative.  '''''Fascination''''', as the ability of an environment to generate awe in people; the amount of awe can give the directed attention a rest as it appears the involuntary attention in its place. '''''Being away''''', a feeling that can be in objective or subjective form, as a person can be far away from a location or let his or her mind let go from everyday life and worries. '''''Extension''''', referring to the connection between each element found in an environment; the feeling of being able to travel through the environment in order to look for information it provides to the observer.  '''''Compatibility''''', characteristics found in an environment that meet the preferences and goals of a person.&lt;ref name="kaplan1989" /&gt;

== Mental fatigue ==
The function of directed attention is to inhibit stimulus from the environment. Its effectiveness will diminish over time with constant use. The result is mental fatigue, which increases the difficulty of discriminating environmental stimulus.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kaplan|first=Stephen|last2=Berman|first2=Marc G.|date=2017-05-05|title=Directed Attention as a Common Resource for Executive Functioning and Self-Regulation|url=http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/1745691609356784|journal=Perspectives on Psychological Science|language=en|volume=5|issue=1|pages=43–57|doi=10.1177/1745691609356784}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hartig|first=Terry|last2=Mang|first2=Marlis|last3=Evans|first3=Gary W.|date=2016-07-26|title=Restorative Effects of Natural Environment Experiences|url=http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/0013916591231001|journal=Environment and Behavior|language=en|volume=23|issue=1|pages=3–26|doi=10.1177/0013916591231001}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kaplan, R., &amp; Kaplan, S. (1989). ''The Experience of Nature: A Psychological Perspective''. Cambridge, New York: Cambridge University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Directed attention==
Attention restoration theory describes a person as being in several states of [[attention]]:
* Directed attention
* Directed attention fatigue
* Effortless attention
* Restored attention

Tasks that require mental effort draw upon "directed attention". People must expend effort to achieve focus, to delay expression of inappropriate [[emotion]]s or actions, and to inhibit distractions. That is, they must concentrate on the higher task, avoiding distractions. Performing the actual task also requires other knowledge and skills.

In ''Peopleware'', a book on office work, [[Tom DeMarco]] and Tim Lister&lt;ref name="peopleware"&gt;{{cite book |title=Peopleware: Productive Projects and Teams |last=DeMarco |first=Tom |last2=Lister |first2=Tim |publisher=John Wiley and Sons |year=1988 |isbn=978-0-396-08808-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; report that in an office environment, workers may take 15 minutes to achieve this state of ''[[flow (psychology)|flow]]'' in their concentration, and that it will be destroyed in a moment by an interruption such as a telephone call.

The task may be fascinating so that it allows "effortless attention", or may have sufficient scope to sustain interaction without boredom, or may simply be more compatible with a person's interests. However, after a period of directed attention, people begin to suffer "directed attention fatigue". They become distracted, irritable, impatient. They become less effective in performing their tasks.

[[Attention]] may be "restored" by changing to a different kind of task that uses different parts of the brain,&lt;ref name="kaplan1995"/&gt;&lt;ref name="cimprich2007"/&gt; as in the familiar idiom "a change is as good as a rest". Alternatively, exposure to natural environments and wilderness has psychological benefits including attention restoration.

Nature has an abundance of fascinating objects. "Soft fascinations" such as clouds in the sky or leaves rustling in a breeze, gain our attention relatively effortlessly and are compatible with our wants and needs. This is by comparison to snakes and spiders, which gain our attention out of fear.&lt;ref&gt;Ulrich, R.S.; Simons, R.F.; Losito, B.D.; Fiorito, E.; Miles, M.A.; Zelson, M. Stress recovery during exposure to natural and urban environments. J. Environ. Psychol. 1991, 11, 201-230.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[biophilia hypothesis]] argues that people are instinctively enthusiastic about nature, and both Fuller et al.&lt;ref&gt;Fuller, R. A., Irvine, K. N., Devine-Wright, P., Warren, P. H., &amp; Gaston, K. J. [http://rsbl.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/3/4/390.full.pdf+html Psychological benefits of greenspace increase with biodiversity.], Biology letters, 3(4), 390-394.&lt;/ref&gt; and Irvine et al.&lt;ref&gt;Irvine, K. N., Warber, S. L., Devine-Wright, P., &amp; Gaston, K. J. (2013) [http://www.mdpi.com/1660-4601/10/1/417 Understanding urban green space as a health resource: A qualitative comparison of visit motivation and derived effects among park users in Sheffield] International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health, 10(1), 417-442.&lt;/ref&gt; suggest that the positive psychological effect increases as the perceived biodiversity of the landscape increases.

After spending some time of effortless attention to soft fascinations removed from their day to day tasks, people may have a chance to reflect. This brings a "restorative" benefit which allows further attention.

==Stress reduction==
After medical [[surgery]], patients resting in rooms overlooking trees recovered better than those in rooms with only a view of a brick wall.&lt;ref&gt;Ulrich R. 1984&lt;/ref&gt; They experienced fewer complications from the surgery, recovered faster, and asked for weaker painkiller drugs. Similarly, natural scenes can reduce stress before an event.&lt;ref&gt;Ulrich R. 1986&lt;/ref&gt;

Women with [[breast cancer]] who walked in a park, watched birds, or tended flowers, achieved better attention after surgery.&lt;ref name="cimprich2007"&gt;[http://www.umb.no/statisk/greencare/meetings/presentations_vienna_2007/cimprich_cost_pres_71007.pdf Attention Restoration Theory: Empirical Work and Practical Applications], by Cimprich B. (2007)&lt;/ref&gt; Merely keeping sight of natural features improves [[self-discipline]] in inner-city girls.&lt;ref&gt;Taylor A.F., Kuo F.E., Sullivan W.C. (2001). [http://www.outdoorfoundation.org/pdf/ViewsOfNature.pdf Views of Nature and Self Discipline: Evidence from Inner City Children] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081120022547/http://www.outdoorfoundation.org/pdf/ViewsOfNature.pdf |date=2008-11-20 }} in Journal of Environmental Psychology (2001), vol. 21.&lt;/ref&gt; Children in New York State were less stressed by adversity when they lived in rural areas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Wells |first=Nancy M. |last2=Evans |first2=G.W. |title=Nearby Nature: A Buffer of Life Stress Among Rural Children |year=2003 |journal=Environment and Behavior |issue=35.3 |pages=311–330 |url=http://www.outdoorfoundation.org/pdf/NearbyNature.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; Stress in college examinations was similarly reduced by viewing natural scenes.&lt;ref&gt;Ulrich R. 1979&lt;/ref&gt; Viewing scenes of urban streets and artifacts excluding nature did not achieve any stress reduction, in a similar study upon workers viewing a film about industrial accidents.

Taking breaks outside in settings that contained some nature has been shown to reduce stress,&lt;ref&gt;Irvine, K.N.

A '''baler''', most often called a '''hay baler''' &lt;!--reedirects here---&gt; is a piece of [[farm machinery]] used to compress a cut and raked crop (such as [[hay]], [[cotton]], [[flax]]  [[straw]], salt marsh hay, or [[silage]]) into compact bales that are easy to handle, transport, and store. Often, bales are configured to dry and preserve some intrinsic (e.g. the nutritional) value of the plants bundled. Several different types of balers are commonly used, each producing a different type of bale &amp;ndash; rectangular or cylindrical, of various sizes, bound with [[twine]], [[strapping]],  [[netting]], or [[baling wire|wire]].

Industrial balers are also used in material [[Materials recovery facility|recycling facilities]], primarily for baling metal, plastic, or paper for transport.

Before the 19th century, hay was cut by hand and most typically stored in haystacks using hay forks to rake and gather the scythed grasses into optimal sized heaps &amp;mdash; neither too large (promoting conditions that might create spontaneous combustion), nor too small, so much of the pile is susceptible to rotting. These haystacks lifted most of the plant fibers up off the ground, letting air in and water drain out, so the grasses could dry and cure, to retain nutrition for livestock feed at a later time. In the 1860s, mechanical cutting devices were developed; from these came the modern devices including mechanical mowers and balers. In 1872, a reaper that used a knotter device to bundle and bind hay was invented by Charles Withington; this was commercialized in 1874 by [[Cyrus McCormick]].&lt;ref name="bridon"&gt;Bridon Cordage, [http://www.bridoncordage.com/history_twine.html The role of twine in North American agriculture] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120222125539/http://www.bridoncordage.com/history_twine.html |date=2012-02-22 }}" (accessed Jan 14, 2011)&lt;/ref&gt; In 1936, Innes invented an automatic baler that tied bales with twine using Appleby-type knotters from a John Deere grain binder; In 1938 Edwin Nolt filed a patent&lt;ref name="noltpatent"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://patentimages.storage.googleapis.com/c9/15/66/bf7e71e31d796f/US2236628.pdf|title=Means for Baling Material}}&lt;/ref&gt; for an improved version that was more reliable.&lt;ref name="bridon" /&gt; 
 The first round baler was probably invented in the late 19th century and one was shown in Paris by Pilter (as illustrated by Michael Williams in Steam Power in Agriculture: Blandford, 1977). This was a portable machine designed for use with threshing machines. 

==Round baler==
[[Image:AllisChalmers Rotobaler2.jpg|right|thumb|Allis Chalmers Rotobaler]]
[[Image:Rundballenpresse.gif|left|thumb|Round baler dumping a fresh bale]]
The most common type of baler in industrialized countries today is the round baler. It produces cylinder-shaped "round" or "rolled" bales. The design has a "thatched roof" effect that withstands weather well.&lt;ref name="ag.iastate.edu"/&gt; Grass is rolled up inside the baler using rubberized belts, fixed rollers, or a combination of the two. When the bale reaches a predetermined size, either netting or [[twine]] is wrapped around it to hold its shape. The back of the baler swings open, and the bale is discharged. The bales are complete at this stage, but they may also be wrapped in plastic sheeting by a [[bale wrapper]], either to keep hay dry when stored outside or convert damp grass into [[silage]]. Variable-chamber large round balers typically produce bales from {{convert|48|to|72|in|cm}} in diameter and up to {{convert|60|in|cm}} in width. The bales can weigh anywhere from {{convert|1100|to|2200|lb|kg}}, depending upon size, material, and [[moisture content]]. Common modern small round balers (also called "mini round balers" or "roto-balers") produce bales {{convert|20|to|22|in|cm}} in diameter and {{convert|20.5|to|28|in|cm}} in width, generally weighing from {{convert|40|to|55|lb|kg}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Goodwin|first1=Pat|title=Buyer's Guide: Hay Equipment for Compact Tractors|url=http://tractortoolsdirect.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Hay-Equipment-for-Compact-Tractors-Buyers-Guide-Extension-outreach-SMALLER.pdf|accessdate=14 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Originally conceived by Ummo Luebben circa 1910, the first round baler did not see production until 1947 when [[Allis-Chalmers]] introduced the Roto-Baler. Marketed for the water-shedding and light weight properties of its hay bales, AC had sold nearly 70,000 units by the end of production in 1960.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.toytractorshow.com/ac_inovation.htm|title=Allis-Chalmers Innovation |accessdate=January 7, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The next major innovation began in 1965 when a graduate student at Iowa State University, Virgil Haverdink, sought out Wesley F. Buchele, a professor of Agricultural Engineering, seeking a research topic for a master thesis.&lt;ref name="ag.iastate.edu"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ag.iastate.edu/coa150/buchele.php |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-12-21 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131224122555/http://www.ag.iastate.edu/coa150/buchele.php |archivedate=2013-12-24 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ag.iastate.edu/coa150/pop10_8.php |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-12-21 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131224114153/http://www.ag.iastate.edu/coa150/pop10_8.php |archivedate=2013-12-24 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Over the next year Buchele and Haverdink developed a new design for a large round baler, completed and tested in 1966, and thereafter dubbed the Buchele-Haverdink large round baler.&lt;ref name="ag.iastate.edu"/&gt;  The large round bales were about {{convert|1.5|m|ft|abbr=off|sp=us}} in diameter, {{convert|2|m|ft|abbr=off|sp=us}} long, and they weighed about {{convert|270|kg|lb|abbr=off}} after they dried—about 80&amp;nbsp;kg/m&lt;sup&gt;3 (&lt;/sup&gt;5&amp;nbsp;lb/ft&lt;sup&gt;3)&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;ref name="thefreelibrary.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thefreelibrary.com/Why%20the%20large%20round%20bale?%20A%20little%20hay%20history.-a0128059669|title=Why the large round bale? A little hay history. - Free Online Library|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The design was promoted as a "Whale of a Bale" and Iowa State University now explains the innovative design as follows:
&lt;blockquote&gt; 
"Farmers were saved from the backbreaking chore of slinging hay bales in the 1960s, when Iowa State agricultural engineering professor Wesley Buchele and a group of student researchers invented a baler that produced large, round bales that could be moved by tractor. The baler has become the predominant forage-handling machine in the United States."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fpm.iastate.edu/maps/memorials/marker.asp?id=15-01|title=Innovative Baler|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In the summer of 1969, the Australian Econ Fodder Roller baler came out, a design that made a {{convert|135|kg|lb|abbr=on}} ground-rolled bale. In September of that same year, The Hawkbilt Company of Vinton, Iowa, contacted Dr. Buchele about his design, then fabricated a large ground-rolling round baler which baled hay that had been laid out in a [[windrow]], and began manufacturing large round balers in 1970.&lt;ref name="thefreelibrary.com"/&gt; In 1972, Gary Vermeer of Pella, Iowa, designed and fabricated a round baler after the design of the A-C Roto-Baler, and the [[Vermeer Company]] began selling its model 605 - the first modern round baler. The Vermeer design used belts to compact hay into a cylindrical shape as is seen today.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vermeerag.com/history/1972.cfm|title=1972 |accessdate=January 7, 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090924013317/http://www.vermeerag.com/history/1972.cfm |archivedate=September 24, 2009 |df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In the early 1980s, collaboration between [[Eaton Corporation|Walterscheid]] and Vermeer produced the first effective uses of [[CV joint]]s in balers, and later in other farm machinery. Due to the heavy torque required for such equipment, double Cardan joints are primarily used. Former Walterscheid engineer Martin Brown is credited with "inventing" this use for universal joints.

By 1975, fifteen American and Canadian companies were manufacturing large round balers.&lt;ref name="thefreelibrary.com"/&gt;

===Transport, handling, and feeding===

==== Short-haul transport and on-field handling ====
[[Image:Round hay bale at dawn02.jpg|left|thumb|A large round bale]]
Due to the ability for round bales to roll away on a slope, they require specific treatment for safe transport and handling. Small round bales can typically be moved by hand or with lower-powered equipment. Large round bales, due to their size and weight (they can weigh a ton or more) require special transport and moving equipment.

The most important tool for large round bale handling is the [[bale spear]] or spike, which is usually mounted on the back of a tractor or the front of a [[skid-steer]]. It is inserted into the approximate center of the round bale, then lifted and the bale is hauled away. Once at the destination, the bale is set down, and the spear pulled out. Careful placement of the spear in the center is needed or the bale can spin around and touch the ground while in transport, causing a loss of control. When used for wrapped bales that are to be stored further, the spear makes a hole in the wrapping that must be sealed with plastic tape to maintain a hermetic seal.

Alternatively, a [[grapple fork]] may be used to lift and transport large round bales. The grapple fork is a hydraulically driven implement attached to the end of a tractor's bucket loader. When the hydraulic cylinder is extended, the fork clamps downward toward the bucket, much like a closing hand. To move a large round bale, the tractor approaches the bale from the side and places the bucket underneath the bale. The fork is then clamped down across the top of the bale, and the bucket is lifted with the bale in tow. Grab hooks installed on the bucket of a tractor are another tool used to handle round bales, and be done by a farmer with welding skills by welding two hooks and a heavy chain to the outside top of a tractor front loader bucket.

==== Long-haul transport ====
The rounded surface of round bales poses a challenge for long-haul, flat-bed transport, as they could roll off of the flat surface if not properly supported. This is particularly the case with large round bales; their size makes them difficult to flip, so it may not be feasible to flip many of them onto the flat surface for transport and then re-position them on the round surface at the destination. One option that works with both large and small round bales is to equip the flat-bed trailer with guard-rails at either end, which prevent bales from rolling either forward or backward. Another solution is the saddle wagon, which has closely spaced rounded saddles or support posts in which round bales sit. The tall sides of each saddle prevent the bales from rolling around while on the wagon, as the bale settles down in between posts. On 3 September 2010, on the A381 in Halwell near [[Totnes]], [[Devon]], UK an early member of British rock group [[Electric Light Orchestra|ELO]] Mike Edwards was killed when his van was crushed by a large round bale. The cellist, 62, died instantly when the {{convert|600|kg|lb|adj=on}} bale fell from a tractor on nearby farmland before rolling onto the road and crushing his van.&lt;ref&gt;ELO's Mike Edwards killed by hay bale in freak crash at bbc.co.uk&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Feeding ====
A large round bale can be directly used for feeding animals by placing it in a feeding area, tipping it over, removing the bale wrap, and placing a protective ring (a ''ring feeder'') around the outside so that animals don't walk on hay that has been peeled off the outer perimeter of the bale. The round baler's rotational forming and compaction process also enables both large and small round bales to be fed out by unrolling the bale, leaving a continuous flat strip in the field or behind a feeding barrier.

===Silage or haylage===
[[File:High Moisture Round Bale - Pickup and Wrapping 320k.ogg|thumb|320px|Video: Picking up and applying plastic cling wrap to a round bale.]]
[[File:High Moisture Round Bale - Sealing Bales Together 320k.ogg|thumb|320px|Video: Sealing the wrapped bales together.]]
A recent{{When|date=August 2009}} innovation in hay storage has been the development of the silage or haylage bale, which is a high-moisture bale wrapped in plastic film. These are baled much wetter than hay bales, and are usually smaller than hay bales because the greater moisture content makes them heavier and harder to handle. These bales begin to ferment almost immediately, and the metal bale spear stabbed into the core becomes very warm to the touch from the fermentation process.

Silage or haylage bales may be wrapped by placing them on a rotating bale spear mounted on the rear of a tractor. As the bale spins, a layer of plastic cling film is applied to the exterior of the bale. This roll of plastic is mounted in a sliding shuttle on a steel arm and can move parallel to the bale axis, so the operator does not need to hold up the heavy roll of plastic. The plastic layer extends over the ends of the bale to form a ring of plastic approximately {{convert|12|in|cm}} wide on the ends, with hay exposed in the center.

To stretch the cling-wrap plastic tightly over the bale, the tension is actively adjusted with a knob on the end of the roll, which squeezes the ends of the roll in the shuttle. In this example wrapping video, the operator is attempting to use high tension to get a flat, smooth seal on the right end. However, the tension increases too much and the plastic tears off. The operator recovers by quickly loosening the tension and allows the plastic to feed out halfway around the bale before reapplying the tension to the sheeting.

These bales are placed in a long continuous row, with each wrapped bale pressed firmly against all the other bales in the row before being set down onto the ground. The plastic wrap on the ends of each bale sticks together to seal out air and moisture, protecting the silage from the elements. The end-bales are hand-sealed with strips of cling plastic across the opening.

The airtight seal between each bale permits the row of round bales to ferment as if they were in a [[silo bag]], but they are easier to handle than a silo bag, as they are more robust and compact. The plastic usage is relatively high, and there is no way to reuse the silage-contaminated plastic sheeting, although it can be [[recycling|recycled]] or used as a fuel source via [[incineration]]. The wrapping cost is approximately US$5 per bale.{{Citation needed|date=June 2013}}

An alternative form of wrapping uses the same type of bale placed on a [[bale wrapper]], consisting of pair of rollers on a turntable mounted on the three-point linkage of a tractor. It is then spun about two axes while being wrapped in several layers of cling-wrap plastic film. This covers the ends and sides of the bale in one operation, thus sealing it separately from other bales. The bales are then moved or stacked using a special pincer attachment on the front loader of a tractor, which does not damage the film seal. They can also be moved using a standard bale spike, but this punctures the airtight seal, and the hole in the film must be repaired after each move.

Plastic-wrapped bales must be unwrapped before being fed to livestock to prevent accidental ingestion of the plastic. Like round hay bales, silage bales are usually fed using a ''ring feeder''.
[[Image:Großballenpresse.jpg|right|thumb|Large rectangular baler.]]

==Large rectangular baler==
In 1978, Hesston introduced the first "large square baler," capable of compacting hay into more easily transported large square bales that could be stacked and tarped in the field (to protect them from rain) or loaded on trucks or containers for trucking or export. Depending upon the baler, these bales can weigh from 1000 pounds to 2200 pounds for a 3'x3'x9' or 3'x4'x9' bale (versus 900 pounds for a 3'x4' round bale). As the pickup revolves just above the ground surface, the tines pick up and feed the hay into the flake forming chamber, where a "flake" of hay is formed before being pushed up into the path of the plunger, which then compresses it with great force (200 to over 750 kilonewtons, depending on model) against the existing bale in the chamber. Once the desired length is achieved, the knotter arm is mechanically tripped to begin the knotting cycle in which several knotters (4-6 is common) tie the 4-6 strings that maintain the bale's shape.

In the prairies of Canada, the large rectangular balers are also called "prairie [[wikt:raptor|raptor]]s".

==Rectangular bale handling and transport==
[[File:Ronsenac Mur de balles 2013.jpg|thumb|center|upright=2|Large rectangular bales in a field, [[Charente (département)|Charente]], France. Sizes of stacks of baled hay need to be carefully managed, as the curing process is exothermic and the built up heat around internal bales can reach ignition temperatures in the right weather history and atmospheric conditions. Building a deep stack either too wide, or too high increases the risk of spontaneous ignition.]]
Rectangular bales are easier to transport than round bales, since there is little risk of the bale rolling off the back of a flatbed trailer. The rectangular shape also saves space and allows a complete solid slab of hay to be stacked for transport and storage. Most balers allow adjustment of length and it is common to produce bales of twice the width, allowing stacks with brick-like alternating groups overlapping the row below at right angles, creating a strong structure.

They are well-suited for large-scale livestock [[feedlot]] operations, where many tons of feed are rationed every hour. Most often, they are baled small enough that one person can carry or toss them where needed.

Due to the huge rectangular shape, large spear forks, or squeeze grips are mounted to heavy lifting machinery, such as large fork lifts, tractors equipped with front end loaders, telehandlers, hay squeezes or wheel loaders, to lift these bales.

==Small rectangular baler==
[[File:Small rect kick baling ff 0.25 320x240 aud 1 vid 3.ogv|frame|Video of baling with a kick baler, and unloading into a barn with a hay elevator. (See [[:File:Small rect kick baling ff 0.25 320x240 aud 1 vid 3.ogv|file description]] for links to larger and higher quality videos.)]]
[[Image:IHSquareBalerJuly2004.jpg|right|thumb|A small square baler (International model 435)]]
A type of baler that produces small rectangular (often called "square") bales was once the most prevalent form of baler, but is less common today. It is primarily used on small acreages where large equipment is impractical, and also for the production of hay for small operations, particularly [[horse]] owners who may not have access to the specialized feeding machinery used for larger bales. Each bale is about {{convert|15|x|18|x|40|in|cm}}. The bales are usually wrapped with two, but sometimes three, or more strands of knotted twine. The bales are light enough for one person to handle, about {{convert|45|to|60|lb|kg}}, depending upon the crop and pressure applied (can be 100 lbs for a 16"x18" 2-string bale). Many balers have adjustable bale chamber pressure and bale length, so shorter, less-dense bales can be produced for ease of handling.

To form the bale, the material to be baled (which is often hay or straw) in the [[windrow]] is lifted by tines in the baler's ''reel''. This material is then ''packed'' into the bale chamber, which runs the length of one side of the baler (normally the right hand side when viewed from the front) in offset balers. Balers like Hesston models use an in-line system where the hay goes straight through from the pickup to the flake chamber to the plunger and bale-forming chamber. A combination plunger and knife move back and forth in the front of this chamber, with the knife closing the door into the bale chamber as it moves backwards. The plunger and knife are attached to a heavy asymmetrical flywheel to provide extra force as they pack the bales. A measuring device—normally a spiked wheel that is turned by the emerging bales—measures the amount of material that is being compressed and, at the appropriate length it triggers the ''knotters'' that wrap the twine around the bale and tie it off. As the next bale is formed the tied one is driven out of the rear of the baling chamber, where it can either drop to the ground, or sent to a wagon towed behind the baler. When a wagon is used, the bale may be lifted by hand from the chamber by a worker on the wagon who stacks the bales on the wagon, or the bale may be propelled into the wagon by a mechanism on the baler, commonly either a "thrower" (parallel high-speed drive belts which throw the bale into the wagon) or a "kicker" (mechanical arm which throws the bale into the wagon). In the case of a thrower or kicker, the wagon has high walls on the left, right, and back sides, and a short wall on the front side, to contain the randomly piled bales. This process continues as long as there is material to be baled, and twine to tie it with.

This form of bale is not much used in large-scale commercial agriculture, because of the costs involved in handling many small bales. However, it enjoys some popularity in small-scale, low-mechanization agriculture and horse-keeping. Besides using simpler machinery and being easy to handle, these small bales can also be used for insulation and building materials in [[straw-bale construction]]. Square bales may generally weather better than round bales because a more much dense stack can be put up.{{Citation needed|date=August 2009}} However, they don't shed water as round bales do. Convenience is also a major factor in farmers deciding to continue putting up square bales, as they make feeding and bedding in confined areas (stables, barns, etc.) much easier.

Many of these older balers are still to be found on farms today, particularly in dry areas, where bales can be left outside for long periods.

The automatic-baler for small square bales took on most of its present form in 1938 with the first such baler sold as Arthur S. Young's Automation Baler. It was manufactured in small numbers until acquired by ''[[New Holland Ag]].''

In Europe, in as early as 1939, both [[Claas]] of Germany and Rousseau SA of France had automatic twine tying pick-up balers. Most of these produced low density bales though. The first successful pick-up balers were made by the Ann Arbor Company in 1929. Ann Arbor was acquired by the [[Oliver Farm Equipment Company]] in 1943. Despite their head start on the rest of the field, no Ann Arbor balers carried automatic knotters or twisters and Oliver didn't produce its own automatic tying baler until 1949.

===Hay presses, wire balers===
[[Image:Historic baler.jpg|thumb|right|upright|Stationary baler]]
Prior to 1937 the hay press was the common name of the stationary baling implement, powered with a tractor or stationary engine using a belt on a [[flat-belt pulley|belt pulley]], with the hay being brought to the baler and fed in by hand. Later, balers were made mobile, with a 'pickup' to gather up the hay and feed it into the chamber. These often used air cooled gasoline engines mounted on the baler for power. The biggest change to this type of baler since 1940 is being powered by the [[tractor]] through its [[power take-off]] (PTO), instead of by a built-in internal combustion engine.

In present-day production, small square balers can be ordered with twine knotters or wire tie knotters.

Not all stationary wire tying balers used 2 wires. It was not uncommon for the larger bale size (usually 17" x 22") machines to use 'boards' that had three slots for wires and hence tied three wires per bale. Most North American manufacturers produced these machines as either regular models or as size options. 'Small square' three wire tying pick-up balers were available from the early 1930s, principally from [[Case Corporation|J. I. Case &amp; Co.]] and [[Ann Arbor (automobile)|Ann Arbor]]. These machines were hand tying and hand threading machines.

==Square/wire bale history==

=== Pickup and handling methods===
In the 1940s most farmers would bale hay in the field with a small tractor with 20 or less horsepower, and the tied bales would be dropped onto the ground as the baler moved through the field. Another team of workers with horses and a flatbed wagon would come by and use a sharp metal hook to grab the bale and throw it up onto the wagon while an assistant stacks the bale, for transport to the barn.

A later time-saving innovation was to tow the flatbed wagon directly behind the baler, and the bale would be pushed up a ramp to a waiting attendant on the wagon. The attendant hooks the bale off the ramp and stacks it on the wagon, while waiting for the next bale to be produced.

Eventually, as tractor horsepower increased, the thrower-baler became possible, which eliminated the need for someone to stand on the wagon and pick up the finished bales. The first thrower mechanism used two fast-moving friction belts to grab finished bales and throw them at an angle up in the air onto the bale wagon. The bale wagon was modified from a flatbed into a three-sided skeleton frame open at the front, to act as a catcher's net for the thrown bales.

As tractor horsepower further increased, the next innovation of the thrower-baler was the hydraulic tossing baler. This employs a flat pan behind the bale knotter. As bales advance out the back of the baler, they are pushed onto the pan one at a time. When the bale has moved fully onto the pan, the pan suddenly pops up, pushed by a large [[hydraulic cylinder]], and tosses the bale up into the wagon like a [[catapult]].

The pan-thrower method puts much less stress on the bales compared to the belt-thrower. The friction belts of the belt-thrower stress the twine and knots as they grip the bale, and would occasionally cause bales to break apart in the thrower or when the bales landed in the wagon.

[[File:Stacker.jpg|thumb|Square bale stacker]]
[[File:Stacking Square Bales - geograph.org.uk - 1444507.jpg|thumb|A smaller type of stacker]]
Bales may be picked up from the field and stacked using a self-powered machine called a ''bale stacker'', ''bale wagon'' or ''harobed''. There are several designs and sizes. One type picks up square bales are dropped by the baler with the strings facing upward. The stacker will drive up to each bale, pick it up and set it on a three-bale-wide table (the strings are now facing upwards). Once three bales are on the table, the table lifts up and back, causing the three bales to face strings to the side again; this happens three more times until there are 16 bales on the main table. This table will lift like the smaller one, and the bales will be up against a vertical table. The machine will hold 160 bales (ten tiers); usually there will be cross-tiers near the center to keep the stack from swaying or collapsing if any weight is applied to the top of the stack. The full load will be transported to a barn; the whole rear of the stacker will tilt upwards until it is vertical. There will be two pushers that will extend through the machine and hold the bottom of the stack from being pulled out from the stacker while it is driven out of the barn.

In Britain (if small square bales are still to be used), they are usually collected as they fall out of the baler in a ''bale sledge'' dragged behind the baler. This has four channels, controlled by automatic mechanical balances, catches and springs, which sort each bale into its place in a square ''eight''. When the sledge is full, a catch is tripped automatically, and a door at the rear opens to leave the eight lying neatly together on the ground. These may be picked up individually and loaded by hand, or they may be picked up all eight together by a ''bale grab'' on a tractor, a special [[Loader (equipment)|front loader]] consisting of many hydraulically powered downward-pointing curved spikes. The square eight will then be stacked, either on a trailer for transport, or in a roughly cubic field stack eight or ten layers high. This cube may then be transported by a large machine attached to the [[three-point hitch]] behind a tractor, which clamps the sides of the cube and lifts it bodily.

===Storage methods===
Before [[rural electrification|electrification]] occurred in rural parts of the United States in the 1940s, some small dairy farms would have tractors but not electric power. Often just one neighbor who could afford a tractor would do all the baling for surrounding farmers still using horses.

To get the bales up into the hayloft, a pulley system ran on a track along the peak of the barn's hayloft. This track also stuck a few feet out the end of the loft, with a large access door under the track. On the bottom of the pulley system was a bale spear, which is pointed on the end and has retractable retention spikes.

A flatbed wagon would pull up next to the barn underneath the end of the track, the spear lowered down to the wagon, and speared into a single bale. The pulley rope would be used to manually lift the bale up until it could enter the mow through the door, then moved along the track into the barn and finally released for manual stacking in tight rows across the floor of the loft. As the stack filled the loft, the bales would be lifted higher and higher with the pulleys until the hay was stacked all the way up to the peak.

When electricity arrived, the bale spear, pulley and track system were replaced by long motorized bale conveyors known as hay elevators. A typical elevator is an open skeletal frame, with a chain that has dull {{convert|3|in|mm|adj=on}} spikes every few feet along the chain to grab bales and drag them along. One elevator replaced the spear track and ran the entire length of the peak of the barn. A second elevator was either installed at a 30-degree slope on the side of the barn to lift bales up to the peak elevator, or used dual front-back chains surrounding the bale to lift bales straight up the side of the barn to the peak elevator.

A bale wagon pulled up next to the lifting elevator, and a farm worker placed bales one at a time onto the angled track. Once bales arrived at the peak elevator, adjustable tipping gates along the length of the peak elevator were opened by pulling a cable from the floor of the hayloft, so that bales tipped off the elevator and dropped down to the floor in different areas of the loft. This permitted a single elevator to transport hay to one part of a loft and straw to another part.

This complete hay elevator lifting, transport, and dropping system reduced bale storage labor to a single person, who simply pulls up with a wagon, turns on the elevators and starts placing bales on it, occasionally checking to make sure that bales are falling in the right locations in the loft.

The neat stacking of bales in the loft is often sacrificed for the speed of just letting them fall and roll down the growing pile in the loft, and changing the elevator gates to fill in open areas around the loose pile. But if desired, the loose bale pile dropped by the elevator could be rearranged into orderly rows between wagon loads.

===Usage once in the barn===
The process of retrieving bales from a hayloft has stayed relatively unchanged from the beginning of baling. Typically workers were sent up into the loft, to climb up onto the bale stack, pull bales off the stack, and throw or roll them down the stack to the open floor of the loft. Once the bale is down on the floor, workers climb down the stack, open a cover over a bale chute in the floor of the loft, and push the bales down the chute to the livestock area of the barn.

Most barns were equipped with several chutes along the sides and in the center of the loft floor. This permitted bales to be dropped into the area where they were to be used. Hay bales would be dropped through side chutes, to be broken up and fed to the cattle. Straw bales would be dropped down the center chute, to be distributed as bedding in the livestock standing/resting areas.

Traditionally multiple bales were dropped down to the livestock floor and the twine removed by hand. After drying and being stored under tons of pressure in the haystack, most bales are tightly compacted and need to be torn apart and fluffed up for use.

One recent method of speeding up all this manual bale handling is the bale shredder, which is a large vertical drum with rotary cutting/ripping teeth at the base of the drum. The shredder is placed under the chute and several bales dropped in. A worker then pushes the shredder along the barn aisle as it rips up a bale and spews it out in a continuous fluffy stream of material.

==Industrial balers==
[[Image:Baler Poly Packer.jpg|left|thumb|A specialized baler designed to compact [[stretch wrap]].]]

Industrial balers are typically used to compact similar types of waste, such as [[Paper|office paper]], [[Corrugated fiberboard]], [[plastic]], foil and cans, for sale to recycling companies. These balers are made of [[steel]] with a [[hydraulic ram]] to compress the material loaded. Some balers are simple and labor-intensive, but are suitable for smaller volumes. Other balers are very complex and automated, and are used where large quantities of waste are handled.

Used in recycling facilities, balers are a packaging step that allows for the aforementioned commodities to be broken down into dense cubes of one type of material at a time. There are different balers used depending on the material type. After a specific material is crushed down into a dense cube, it is tied to a bale by a thick wire and then pushed out of the machine. This process allows for easy transport of all materials involved.

'''Two-ram baler:'''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.recyclingtoday.com/baler-guide----two-ram-tough/|title=Baler Guide &amp;ndash; Two Ram Tough|last=|first=|date=|work=Recycling Today|access-date=}}{{dead link|date=April 2017|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}&lt;/ref&gt; A two-ram baler is a baling machine that contains two cylinders and is able to bundle and package most commodities except for cardboard and clear film. This baler is known for its durability and is able to take in more bulky material.

'''Single-ram baler:''' A single-ram baler is a baling machine that contains one cylinder. Because this baler is relatively smaller than the two-ram baler, it is best for small and medium commodities.

'''Closed door baler:''' This baler bales clear plastic film.

'''American baler:''' This baler bales corrugated materials.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2093">A '''chess diagram''' is graphic representation and stylized of a specific moment in a [[chess]] game, showing the different positions occupied by chess pieces in given time during game development.

This graphical representation is done through symbols previously agreed for this purpose in order to facilitate reading the diagram.

The chess diagrams are a resource widely used not only in teaching game in the courses offered to people just getting into it; but they are also used in subsequent analysis, that amateurs and professionals players at this discipline can make of games played, especially in championship games.

Similarly they are used in the development of [[chess problem]]s that are all these diagrams with composed positions and whose solution is to checkmate in a given number of moves and are often published in newspapers and magazines.

Icons or symbols used represent the basic characteristics of chessmen, such as in the case of rook is used picture of a defensive tower made with bricks and with 3 battlements and 2 gunboats at top of its.

It is worth mentioning that at present most diagrams represent the [[Bishop (chess)|bishop]] using a miter with two lappets by way of feet; but there are some variants of diagrams where this piece is represented by a helmet with visor.

== History ==
Although the term "civic space" has only been in common usage since after the turn of this millennium, the rights upon which the concept is based have been a necessary feature of every democratic society. Global civil society alliance [[CIVICUS]] began using the term regularly after the inception of the Civic Space Initiative in 2011, defining it as "the place, physical, virtual, and legal, where people exercise their rights to freedom of association, expression, and peaceful assembly. By forming associations, by speaking out on issues of public concern, by gathering together in online and offline fora, and by participating in public decision-making, individuals use civic space to solve problems and improve lives. A robust and protected civic space forms the cornerstone of accountable, responsive democratic governance and stable societies." Civic space is also closely connected to the development of post–World War II human rights norms, and particularly the [[Universal Declaration on Human Rights]] in 1948 which established clear protections for the rights to freedom of association, peaceful assembly and expression.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.un.org/en/universal-declaration-human-rights/index.html|title=Universal Declaration of Human Rights - United Nations|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As a concept, civic space is also closely related to the evolution of the concept of [[civil society]]. While the ideas embodied in civil society can be traced to many different civilisations, the term civil society has many different definitions but has its roots in ancient Greece and the early work of [[Aristotle]] on the concepts of "[[community]]" or "[[polity]]" characterised by a shared set of [[norm (social)|norm]]s or [[ethos]].&lt;ref group=Note&gt;Language here is adapted from the Wikipedia article on [[civil society]]&lt;/ref&gt; Some theorists interpret civil society very closely to the modern understanding of civic space, taking it to mean "the elements such as freedom of speech, an [[independent judiciary]], etc, that make up a democratic society."&lt;ref&gt;''Collins English Dictionary''&lt;/ref&gt; Especially in the discussions among thinkers of Eastern and Central Europe, civil society is seen also as a concept of [[civic values]].&lt;ref group=Note&gt;Taken directly from the [[civil society]] article&lt;/ref&gt; Most modern-day definitions of civil society however view it more in terms of "the arena, outside of the family, the state and the market where people associate to advance common interests."&lt;ref&gt;This is the CIVICUS definition, as employed in the [http://www.civicus.org/media/CSI_Ghana_Country_Report.pdf CSI]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Protection of rights ==
Core civic space rights – the rights to freedom of association, freedom of peaceful assembly and freedom of expression – are guaranteed by law. States that are signatories of [[international conventions]] (such as the United Nations [[International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights]]) and other regional treaties containing similar provisions, are obliged to respect and protect these rights. These states are also obligated to protect these rights in domestic law and many of the ratifying States have included protection of these rights in their constitutions as fundamental freedoms.  States are obliged not only to respect and promote these rights but also to protect them from infringement by both state and [[non-state actors]].&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;CIVICUS, [http://www.civicus.org/images/stories/Compendium_International_Legal%20Instruments_Et_Al_2014.pdf Compendium Of International Legal Instruments And Other Inter-Governmental Commitments Concerning Core Civil Society Rights], January 2014&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, a progressive [[constitution]] supported by a sound legislative framework that is upheld by a responsive and independent law enforcement machinery is key to enabling and preserving civic space. Notably, Goal 16 of the [[Sustainable Development Goals]] framework agreed to by all UN member states promises to 'promote just, peaceful and inclusive societies.’&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.un.org/sustainabledevelopment/|title=Sustainable Development Goals: 17 Goals to Transform Our World|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As a starting point, while there have been a number of international initiatives launched over recent years to defend civic space, civil society actors were lacking a strong common definition of the terms and shape of the civic space to be defended. To fill this gap, an informal meeting of CSOs, which took place in Bangkok in November 2015, asked the [[Berlin Civil Society Center|International Civil Society Centre]] to facilitate the development of a Civic Charter.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://disrupt-and-innovate.org/civil-society-lets-join-forces-to-defend-our-rights/|title=Civil Society - Let's Join Forces to Defend our Rights - Disrupt &amp; Innovate|date=2016-03-22|work=Disrupt &amp; Innovate|access-date=2017-07-31|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Civic Charter provides a global framework for people’s participation in shaping their societies. The two-page document, which people and organisations can sign on to and use as a basis for joint action, articulates a common set of civic and political rights. Aimed at civil society activists and their organisations, the Civic Charter connects those engaged in the everyday struggle for civic space – on a local, national, regional or international level. Firstly, it draws together the most crucial terms for civic participation in an easily understandable way. Secondly, it serves as a global reference framework to civil society actors for their rights enshrined in international law. Thirdly, it reaffirms people’s rights to participate in shaping their societies. The Civic Charter can provide a more effective basis for campaigning and advocacy for civic participation, as well as for promoting international solidarity with CSOs and activists in a specific country or region.&lt;ref&gt;https://civiccharter.org/about-the-civic-charter-how-it-came-about/&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Freedom of association ===
The right to freely associate includes the right of every person without distinction of any kind, such as race, colour, sex, language, religion, political or other opinion, national or social origin, property, birth, sexual orientation or other status,&lt;ref&gt;Article 2, Universal Declaration on Human Rights&lt;/ref&gt;  to “establish a civil society organisation and also to freely join one or choosing not to participate. Individuals may operate civil society organisations and participate in their activities without fear or unwarranted interference. Freedom of association also encompasses the right to establish branches, recruit staff, raise funds freely, to fair taxation levels and to affiliate and cooperate with other organisations locally, nationally or internationally.”&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;  It also includes the right to form and join trade unions for the protection of his interests.&lt;ref name="Article 22"&gt;[http://www.ohchr.org/en/professionalinterest/pages/ccpr.aspx Article 22, International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights]&lt;/ref&gt; 
 
[[International law]] protects the freedom of association and obligates states not to interfere with this right and only in instances where intervention by the state is necessary in the interests of national security, public safety or public order; the protection of public health or morals; or the protection of the rights and freedoms of others.&lt;ref name="Article 22"/&gt; Like the freedom of expression, the margin for restricting this right is very limited. State actions must lean in favour of permitting civil society activities and creating an enabling environment for civil society to function and thrive.

=== Freedom of expression ===
The right to freedom of expression entails, according to the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, the "freedom to hold opinions without interference and to seek, receive and impart information and ideas through any media and regardless of frontiers."&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.un.org/en/universal-declaration-human-rights/ Article 19, Universal Declaration of Human Rights]&lt;/ref&gt; 
 
The right is fundamental to the existence of civil society. It includes "the right to access information, critically evaluate and speak out against the policies and actions of state and non-state actors, as well as publicly draw attention to and carry out advocacy actions to promote shared concerns, without fear of retribution from any quarter. Civil society organisations are also assured the freedom to carry out investigations and document their findings under this right."&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt; 
 
According to international law (for example see Article 20 of the ICCPR), freedom of expression can only be restricted in certain limited circumstances, provided by law and where it is necessary to protect the rights and reputations of others and to safeguard national security, public order, public health and morals.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ohchr.org/en/professionalinterest/pages/ccpr.aspx Article 19, International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.article19.org/pages/en/limitations.html&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Freedom of assembly ===
The right to freely assemble "assures civil society the freedom to exercise legitimate dissent through peaceful forms of [[protest]] as well as organise meetings and hold [[demonstration (protest)|demonstration]]s to forward matters of common interest."&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;  International law places the same limitations on the restriction of this right as in the case of freedom of association.&lt;ref&gt;Article 21, International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights&lt;/ref&gt;  Moreover, [[international standards]] limit the use of force by the authorities in managing public assemblies.

=== Violations ===
At the international level, civic space violations are regularly documented and reported&lt;ref&gt;For details of the latest violations, visit the [https://monitor.civicus.org CIVICUS Monitor]&lt;/ref&gt; by international human rights organisations like [[CIVICUS]], [[Human Rights Watch]], [[Amnesty International]], the International Centre for Not-for-profit Law (ICNL), [[Article 19]], [[Reporters Without Borders]], Frontline Defenders, the [[International Service for Human Rights]], the [[International Federation for Human Rights]] (FIDH) and others. At the regional, national and sub-national levels there are innumerable [[human rights organisation]]s, [[development organisations]], [[think tank]]s and [[academic institution]]s devoted to researching and campaigning on civic space issues.

Violations of civic space take many forms and can be perpetrated by the state - either directly through officials, police officers or security personnel, or at arm's length through agents or third parties - or non-state actors including criminal gangs, [[terrorist organisations]], [[private corporations]], [[political parties]], [[religious organisations]] and [[civil society]] groups themselves.

==== Non-exhaustive list of examples of civic space violations ====

States can violate freedom of association by establishing restrictive laws&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.icnl.org/research/monitor/index.html ICNL Civic Freedoms Monitor] tracks the proposal, enactment and implementation of such laws&lt;/ref&gt; that restrict people's ability to freely form and operate groups to advance their interests or even prevent them for doing so. For example, in some countries, legislation banned organisations that work in certain topics like human rights to form legally. Moreover,  these restrictive laws place broad oversight powers in the hands of government institutions with which civil society organisations must register and to whom they must account or report regularly. In some cases those governmental oversight bodies have a discretionary power to suspend or terminate an organisation's registration. In the most extreme cases, penalties for noncompliance with NGO laws can include fines and imprisonment. In more  recent years, and with a spike in concern about international terrorism, more and more states have begun to pass anti-terrorism laws which negatively impact upon civic space, and particularly the ability of organisations to operate free from state interference.&lt;ref&gt;The Civil Society Platform on the FATF has campaigned vigorously to oppose such moves in recent years and [http://fatfplatform.org/ their website] contains a wealth of information on this topic&lt;/ref&gt;  States can restrict freedom of association by targeting members of the organisations, [[human rights defenders]] and [[activists]] using intimidation tactics, [[harassment]], [[travel bans]], [[detention (imprisonment)|detention]], among others.

Curtailing the ability to protest can be done within the legislative framework, when the norms in placed unduly restricted the right to assembly by imposing prior authorisation requirements, time and place restrictions, among others. In practice, this right can be restricted when security forces use excessive force to disperse protesters, arbitrary arrest them and even charge protesters with  provisions of the criminal code and even anti terrorism legislation.

Targeting free speech can take various forms. As the media plays a crucial role in disseminating information, States often overregulated media in order to limit, control or prevent critical and dissenting voices to express. In some cases, the [[pluralism (political theory)|pluralistic]] views are also undermined by [[media concentration]] in just a few private corporations. [[Criminalisation]] of [[dissent]] by using [[defamation]] provisions is also commonly used to restrict freedom of expression. Acts of violence against journalists and media workers for reason related to their professional work often occurs and limits the right to freedom of expression and access to information as it also prevents the public from accessing that information.

The internet is a unique tool that allowed individuals to communicate instantly, with a positive impact on the way we currently share and access information.&lt;ref&gt;United Nations. General Assembly. [http://ap.ohchr.org/documents/dpage_e.aspx?m=85 Report of the Special Rapporteur on the promotion and protection of the right to freedom of opinion and expression]. A/66/290. August 10, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;  For that reason, it is particularly targeted by authorities to curtail dissent. Some governments restrict the [[dissemination]] of content on certain sensitive issues by blocking access to social media platforms, deleting certain pages or content and even arresting people for disseminating sensitive information.

A '''complex response''' refers to an environmental reaction to change that occurs at multiple levels to multiple objects, and can induce a chain reaction of responses to a single initial change. It is akin to the [[butterfly effect]]: one small event (change) can cascade through a given system creating new agents of change, and operating at several levels. The term is most commonly used in fluvial [[geomorphology]], or the study of river systems and changes within those systems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=GEOMORPHIC THRESHOLDS AND COMPLEX RESPONSE OF DRAINAGE SYSTEMS|url=http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.453.7356&amp;rep=rep1&amp;type=pdf|first1=S.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="36367">{{About|the law of Conservation of Energy in physics|sustainable energy resources|Energy conservation}}

In physics and chemistry, the '''law of conservation of energy''' states that the total [[energy]] of an [[isolated system]] remains constant, it is said to be [[Conservation law|''conserved'']] over time.&lt;ref name=Feynman2Ch1S2&gt;{{cite book |author=Richard Feynman |title=The Feynman Lectures on Physics Vol I |publisher=Addison Wesley  |year=1970 |isbn=978-0 -201-02115-8  |url=http://www.feynmanlectures.caltech.edu/I_04.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; This law means that energy can neither be created nor destroyed; rather, it can only be transformed or transferred from one form to another. For instance, [[chemical energy]] is [[Energy conversion|converted]] to [[kinetic energy]] when a stick of [[dynamite]] explodes. If one adds up all the forms of energy that were released in the explosion, such as the [[kinetic energy]] of the pieces, as well as heat and sound, one will get the exact decrease of chemical energy in the combustion of the dynamite.  Classically, conservation of energy was distinct from conservation of mass; however, [[special relativity]] showed that mass is related to energy and vice versa by ''E = mc&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;'', and science now takes the view that mass–energy is conserved.

Conservation of energy can be rigorously proven by [[Noether's theorem]] as a consequence of [[Continuous function|continuous]] [[time translation symmetry]]; that is, from the fact that the laws of physics do not change over time.

A consequence of the law of conservation of energy is that a [[Perpetual motion#Classification|perpetual motion machine of the first kind]] cannot exist, that is to say, no system without an external energy supply can deliver an unlimited amount of energy to its surroundings.&lt;ref&gt;Planck, M. (1923/1927). ''Treatise on Thermodynamics'', third English edition translated by A.

==History==
{{Refimprove section|date=November 2015}}
[[File:Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz.jpg|thumb|150px|[[Gottfried Leibniz]]]]
[[Ancient]] [[philosopher]]s as far back as [[Thales of Miletus]] {{circa}}&amp;nbsp;550 BCE had inklings of the conservation of some underlying substance of which everything is made. However, there is no particular reason to identify this with what we know today as "mass-energy" (for example, Thales thought it was water). [[Empedocles]] (490–430 BCE) wrote that in this universal system, composed of [[Classical element|four roots]] (earth, air, water, fire), "nothing comes to be or perishes";&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Janko|first=Richard|title=Empedocles, "On Nature"|journal=Zeitschrift für Papyrologie und Epigraphik|year=2004 |volume=150 |pages=1–26|url=http://ancphil.lsa.umich.edu/-/downloads/faculty/janko/empedocles-nature.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt; instead, these elements suffer continual rearrangement.

In 1605, [[Simon Stevinus]] was able to solve a number of problems in statics based on the principle that [[perpetual motion]] was impossible.

In 1638, [[Galileo Galilei|Galileo]] published his analysis of several situations—including the celebrated "interrupted pendulum"—which can be described (in modern language) as conservatively converting potential energy to kinetic energy and back again. Essentially, he pointed out that the height a moving body rises is equal to the height from which it falls, and used this observation to infer the idea of inertia. The remarkable aspect of this observation is that the height to which a moving body ascends on a frictionless surface does not depend on the shape of the surface.

In 1669, [[Christian Huygens]] published his laws of collision. Among the quantities he listed as being invariant before and after the collision of bodies were both the sum of their linear momentums as well as the sum of their kinetic energies. However, the difference between elastic and inelastic collision was not understood at the time. This led to the dispute among later researchers as to which of these conserved quantities was the more fundamental. In his [[Horologium Oscillatorium]], he gave a much clearer statement regarding the height of ascent of a moving body, and connected this idea with the impossibility of a perpetual motion. Huygens' study of the dynamics of pendulum motion was based on a single principle: that the center of gravity of a heavy object cannot lift itself.

The fact that kinetic energy is scalar, unlike linear momentum which is a vector, and hence easier to work with did not escape the attention of [[Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz]]. It was Leibniz during 1676–1689 who first attempted a mathematical formulation of the kind of energy which is connected with ''motion'' (kinetic energy). Using Huygens' work on collision, Leibniz noticed that in many mechanical systems (of several [[mass]]es, ''m&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'' each with [[velocity]] ''v&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;''),
:&lt;math&gt;\sum_{i} m_i v_i^2&lt;/math&gt;

was conserved so long as the masses did not interact. He called this quantity the ''[[vis viva]]'' or ''living force'' of the system. The principle represents an accurate statement of the approximate conservation of [[kinetic energy]] in situations where there is no friction. Many [[physicist]]s at that time, such as Newton,  held that the [[conservation of momentum]], which holds even in systems with friction, as defined by the [[momentum]]:

:&lt;math&gt;\,\!\sum_{i} m_i v_i&lt;/math&gt;

was the conserved ''vis viva''. It was later shown that both quantities are conserved simultaneously, given the proper conditions such as an [[elastic collision]].

In 1687, [[Isaac Newton]] published his [[Philosophiæ Naturalis Principia Mathematica|Principia]], which was organized around the concept of force and momentum. However, the researchers were quick to recognize that the principles set out in the book, while fine for point masses, were not sufficient to tackle the motions of rigid and fluid bodies. Some other principles were also required.

[[File:Daniel Bernoulli 001.jpg|thumb|left|150px|[[Daniel Bernoulli]]]]

The law of conservation of vis viva was championed by the father and son duo, [[Johann Bernoulli|Johann]] and [[Daniel Bernoulli]]. The former enunciated the principle of [[virtual work]] as used in statics in its full generality in 1715, while the latter based his [[Hydrodynamica]], published in 1738, on this single conservation principle. Daniel's study of loss of vis viva of flowing water led him to formulate the [[Bernoulli's principle]], which relates the loss to be proportional to the change in hydrodynamic pressure. Daniel also formulated the notion of work and efficiency for hydraulic machines; and he gave a kinetic theory of gases, and linked the kinetic energy of gas molecules with the temperature of the gas.

This focus on the vis viva by the continental physicists eventually led to the discovery of stationarity principles governing mechanics, such as the [[D'Alembert's principle]], [[Lagrangian mechanics|Lagrangian]],
and [[Hamiltonian mechanics|Hamiltonian]] formulations of mechanics.

[[Émilie du Châtelet]] (1706  – 1749) proposed and tested the hypothesis of the conservation of total energy, as distinct from momentum. Inspired by the theories of Gottfried Leibniz, she repeated and publicized an experiment originally devised by [[Willem 's Gravesande]] in 1722 in which balls were dropped from different heights into a sheet of soft clay. Each ball's kinetic energy - as indicated by the quantity of material displaced - was shown to be proportional to the square of the velocity. The deformation of the clay was found to be directly proportional to the height the balls were dropped from, equal to the initial potential energy. Earlier workers, including Newton and Voltaire, had all believed that "energy" (so far as they understood the concept at all) was not distinct from momentum and therefore proportional to velocity. According to this understanding, the deformation of the clay should have been proportional to the square root of the height from which the balls were dropped from. In classical physics the correct formula is &lt;math&gt;E_k = \frac12 mv^2&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;E_k&lt;/math&gt; is the kinetic energy of an object, &lt;math&gt;m&lt;/math&gt; its mass and &lt;math&gt;v&lt;/math&gt; its speed. On this basis, Châtelet proposed that energy must always have the same dimensions in any form, which is necessary to be able to relate it in different forms (kinetic, potential, heat…).&lt;ref&gt;Hagengruber, Ruth, editor (2011) ''Émilie du Chatelet between Leibniz and Newton''. Springer. {{ISBN|978-94-007-2074-9}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Arianrhod|first1=Robyn|title=Seduced by logic : Émilie du Châtelet, Mary Somerville, and the Newtonian revolution|date=2012|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=New York|isbn=978-0-19-993161-3|edition=US|url=http://journals.cambridge.org/action/displayAbstract?fromPage=online&amp;aid=9444991}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Engineer]]s such as [[John Smeaton]], [[Peter Ewart]], [[:de:Carl Holtzmann|Carl Holtzmann]], [[Gustave-Adolphe Hirn]] and [[Marc Seguin]] recognized that conservation of momentum alone was not adequate for practical calculation and made use of Leibniz's principle. The principle was also championed by some [[chemist]]s such as [[William Hyde Wollaston]]. Academics such as [[John Playfair]] were quick to point out that kinetic energy is clearly not conserved. This is obvious to a modern analysis based on the [[second law of thermodynamics]], but in the 18th and 19th centuries the fate of the lost energy was still unknown.

Gradually it came to be suspected that the heat inevitably generated by motion under friction was another form of ''vis viva''. In 1783, [[Antoine Lavoisier]] and [[Pierre-Simon Laplace]] reviewed the two competing theories of ''vis viva'' and [[caloric theory]].&lt;ref&gt;Lavoisier, A.L. &amp; Laplace, P.S. (1780) "Memoir on Heat", ''Académie Royale des Sciences'' pp.&amp;nbsp;4–355&lt;/ref&gt; [[Benjamin Thompson|Count Rumford]]'s 1798 observations of heat generation during the [[Boring (manufacturing)|boring]] of [[cannon]]s added more weight to the view that mechanical motion could be converted into heat, and (as importantly) that the conversion was quantitative and could be predicted (allowing for a universal conversion constant between kinetic energy and heat). ''Vis viva'' then started to be known as ''energy'', after the term was first used in that sense by [[Thomas Young (scientist)|Thomas Young]] in 1807.

[[File:Gaspard-Gustave de Coriolis.jpg|thumb|150px|[[Gaspard-Gustave Coriolis]]]]

The recalibration of ''vis viva'' to

:&lt;math&gt;\frac {1} {2}\sum_{i} m_i v_i^2&lt;/math&gt;

which can be understood as converting kinetic energy to [[Work (thermodynamics)|work]], was largely the result of [[Gaspard-Gustave Coriolis]] and [[Jean-Victor Poncelet]] over the period 1819–1839. The former called the quantity ''quantité de travail'' (quantity of work) and the latter, ''travail mécanique'' (mechanical work), and both championed its use in engineering calculation.

In a paper ''Über die Natur der Wärme''(German "On the Nature of Heat/Warmth"), published in the ''[[Zeitschrift für Physik]]'' in 1837, [[Karl Friedrich Mohr]] gave one of the earliest general statements of the doctrine of the conservation of energy in the words: "besides the 54 known chemical elements there is in the physical world one agent only, and this is called ''Kraft'' [energy or work]. It may appear, according to circumstances, as motion, chemical affinity, cohesion, electricity, light and magnetism; and from any one of these forms it can be transformed into any of the others."

===Mechanical equivalent of heat===
A key stage in the development of the modern conservation principle was the demonstration of the ''[[mechanical equivalent of heat]]''. The [[caloric theory]] maintained that heat could neither be created nor destroyed, whereas conservation of energy entails the contrary principle that heat and mechanical work are interchangeable.

In the middle of the eighteenth century, [[Mikhail Lomonosov]], a Russian scientist, postulated his corpusculo-kinetic theory of heat, which rejected the idea of a caloric. Through the results of empirical studies, Lomonosov came to the conclusion that heat was not transferred through the particles of the caloric fluid.

In 1798, Count Rumford ([[Benjamin Thompson]]) performed measurements of the frictional heat generated in boring cannons, and developed the idea that heat is a form of kinetic energy; his measurements refuted caloric theory, but were imprecise enough to leave room for doubt.

[[File:SS-joule.jpg|thumb|left|130px|[[James Prescott Joule]]]]

The mechanical equivalence principle was first stated in its modern form by the German surgeon [[Julius Robert von Mayer]] in 1842.&lt;ref&gt;von Mayer, J.R. (1842) "Remarks on the forces of inorganic nature" in ''Annalen der Chemie und Pharmacie'', '''43''', 233&lt;/ref&gt; Mayer reached his conclusion on a voyage to the [[Dutch East Indies]], where he found that his patients' blood was a deeper red because they were consuming less [[oxygen]], and therefore less energy, to maintain their body temperature in the hotter climate.  He discovered that [[heat]] and [[mechanical work]] were both forms of energy and in 1845, after improving his knowledge of physics, he published a monograph that stated a quantitative relationship between them.&lt;ref&gt;Mayer, J.R. (1845). ''Die organische Bewegung in ihrem Zusammenhange mit dem Stoffwechsel. Ein Beitrag zur Naturkunde'', Dechsler, Heilbronn.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Joule's Apparatus (Harper's Scan).png|thumb|right|[[James Prescott Joule|Joule]]'s apparatus for measuring the mechanical equivalent of heat. A descending weight attached to a string causes a paddle immersed in water to rotate.]]

Meanwhile, in 1843, [[James Prescott Joule]] independently discovered the mechanical equivalent in a series of experiments. In the most famous, now called the "Joule apparatus", a descending weight attached to a string caused a paddle immersed in water to rotate.  He showed that the gravitational [[potential energy]] lost by the weight in descending was equal to the [[internal energy]] gained by the water through [[friction]] with the paddle.

Over the period 1840–1843, similar work was carried out by engineer [[Ludwig A. Colding]], although it was little known outside his native Denmark.

Both Joule's and Mayer's work suffered from resistance and neglect but it was Joule's that eventually drew the wider recognition.

{{For|the dispute between Joule and Mayer over priority|Mechanical equivalent of heat: Priority}}

In 1844, [[William Robert Grove]] postulated a relationship between mechanics, heat, [[light]], [[electricity]] and [[magnetism]] by treating them all as manifestations of a single "force" (''energy'' in modern terms). In 1846, Grove published his theories in his book ''The Correlation of Physical Forces''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author=Grove, W. R. | title=The Correlation of Physical Forces | location=London | publisher=Longmans, Green | year=1874 | edition=6th }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1847, drawing on the earlier work of Joule, [[Nicolas Léonard Sadi Carnot|Sadi Carnot]] and [[Émile Clapeyron]], [[Hermann von Helmholtz]] arrived at conclusions similar to Grove's and published his theories in his book ''Über die Erhaltung der Kraft'' (''On the Conservation of Force'', 1847).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title= On the Conservation of Force|url=http://www.bartleby.com/30/125.html|publisher=Bartleby|accessdate= April 6, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The general modern acceptance of the principle stems from this publication.

In 1850, [[William Rankine]] first used the phrase ''the law of the conservation of energy'' for the principle.&lt;ref&gt;William John Macquorn Rankine (1853) "On the General Law of the Transformation of Energy," ''Proceedings of the Philosophical Society of Glasgow'', vol. 3, no. 5, pages 276-280; reprinted in: (1) ''Philosophical Magazine'', series 4, vol. 5, no. 30, [https://books.google.com/books?id=3Ov22-gFMnEC&amp;pg=PA106&amp;lpg=PA106#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false pages 106-117] (February 1853); and (2) W. J. Millar, ed., ''Miscellaneous Scientific Papers: by W. J. Macquorn Rankine'', ... (London, England: Charles Griffin and Co., 1881), part II, [https://archive.org/stream/miscellaneoussci00rank#page/203/mode/1up pages 203-208]: "The law of the ''Conservation of Energy'' is already known—viz. that the sum of all the energies of the universe, actual and potential, is unchangeable."&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1877, [[Peter Guthrie Tait]] claimed that the principle originated with Sir Isaac Newton, based on a creative reading of propositions 40 and 41 of the ''[[Philosophiae Naturalis Principia Mathematica]]''. This is now regarded as an example of [[Whig history]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

===Mass–energy equivalence===
{{Refimprove section|date=November 2015}}
{{main|Mass–energy equivalence}}

Matter is composed of such things as atoms, electrons, neutrons, and protons. It has [[rest mass|''intrinsic'' or ''rest'' mass]]. In the limited range of recognized experience of the nineteenth century it was found that such rest mass is conserved. Einstein's 1905 theory of [[special relativity]] showed that it corresponds to an equivalent amount of ''rest energy''. This means that it can be converted to or from equivalent amounts of ''other'' (non-material) forms of energy, for example kinetic energy, potential energy, and electromagnetic radiant energy. When this happens, as recognized in twentieth century experience, rest mass is not conserved, unlike the [[mass in special relativity|''total'' mass]] or ''total'' energy. All forms of energy contribute to the total mass and total energy.

For example, an [[electron]] and a [[positron]] each have rest mass.  They can perish together, converting their combined rest energy into [[photon]]s having electromagnetic radiant energy, but no rest mass.  If this occurs within an isolated system that does not release the photons or their energy into the external surroundings, then neither the total ''mass'' nor the total ''energy'' of the system will change.  The produced electromagnetic radiant energy contributes just as much to the inertia (and to any weight) of the system as did the rest mass of the electron and positron before their demise. Likewise, non-material forms of energy can perish into matter, which has rest mass.

Thus, conservation of energy (''total'', including material or ''rest'' energy), and [[conservation of mass]] (''total'', not just ''rest''), each still holds as an (equivalent) law.  In the 18th century these had appeared as two seemingly-distinct laws.

===Conservation of energy in beta decay===
{{Main|Beta decay#Neutrinos in beta decay}}

==First law of thermodynamics==
{{main|First law of thermodynamics}}

For a [[Closed system#In thermodynamics|closed thermodynamic system]], the first law of thermodynamics may be stated as:

:&lt;math&gt;\delta Q = \mathrm{d}U + \delta W&lt;/math&gt;, or equivalently, &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{d}U = \delta Q - \delta W,&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\delta Q&lt;/math&gt; is the quantity of [[energy]] added to the system by a [[heat]]ing process, &lt;math&gt;\delta W&lt;/math&gt; is the quantity of energy lost by the system due to [[Work (thermodynamics)|work]] done by the system on its surroundings and &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{d}U&lt;/math&gt; is the change in the [[internal energy]] of the system.

The l's before the heat and work terms are used to indicate that they describe an increment of energy which is to be interpreted somewhat differently than the &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{d}U&lt;/math&gt; increment of internal energy (see [[Inexact differential]]). Work and heat refer to kinds of process which add or subtract energy to or from a system, while the internal energy &lt;math&gt;U&lt;/math&gt; is a property of a particular state of the system when it is in unchanging thermodynamic equilibrium. Thus the term "heat energy" for &lt;math&gt;\delta Q&lt;/math&gt; means "that amount of energy added as the result of heating" rather than referring to a particular form of energy. Likewise, the term "work energy" for &lt;math&gt;\delta W&lt;/math&gt; means "that amount of energy lost as the result of work". Thus one can state the amount of internal energy possessed by a thermodynamic system that one knows is presently in a given state, but one cannot tell, just from knowledge of the given present state, how much energy has in the past flowed into or out of the system as a result of its being heated or cooled, nor as the result of work being performed on or by the system.

[[Entropy (classical thermodynamics)|Entropy]] is a function of the state of a system which tells of limitations of the possibility of conversion of heat into work.

For a simple compressible system, the work performed by the system may be written:

:&lt;math&gt;\delta W = P\,\mathrm{d}V,&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt; is the [[pressure]] and &lt;math&gt;dV&lt;/math&gt; is a small change in the [[volume]] of the system, each of which are system variables. In the fictive case in which the process is idealized and infinitely slow, so as to be called ''quasi-static'', and regarded as reversible, the heat being transferred from a source with temperature infinitesimally above the system temperature, then the heat energy may be written

:&lt;math&gt;\delta Q = T\,\mathrm{d}S,&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;T&lt;/math&gt; is the [[temperature]] and &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{d}S&lt;/math&gt; is a small change in the [[entropy]] of the system. Temperature and entropy are variables of state of a system.

If an open system (in which mass may be exchanged with the environment) has several walls such that the mass transfer is through rigid walls separate from the heat and work transfers, then the first law may be written:&lt;ref&gt;[[Max Born|Born, M.]] (1949). ''Natural Philosophy of Cause and Chance'', Oxford University Press, London, [https://archive.org/stream/naturalphilosoph032159mbp#page/n157/mode/2up pp. 146–147].&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\mathrm{d}U = \delta Q - \delta W + u'\,dM,\,&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;dM&lt;/math&gt; is the added mass and &lt;math&gt;u'&lt;/math&gt; is the internal energy per unit mass of the added mass, measured in the surroundings before the process.

==Noether's theorem==
{{main|Noether's theorem}}
[[File:Noether.jpg|thumb|200px|[[Emmy Noether]] (1882-1935) was an influential [[mathematician]] known for her groundbreaking contributions to [[abstract algebra]] and [[theoretical physics]].]]
The conservation of energy is a common feature in many physical theories. From a mathematical point of view it is understood as a consequence of [[Noether's theorem]], developed by [[Emmy Noether]] in 1915 and first published in 1918. The theorem states every continuous symmetry of a physical theory has an associated conserved quantity; if the theory's symmetry is time invariance then the conserved quantity is called "energy". The energy conservation law is a consequence of the shift [[Symmetry in physics|symmetry]] of time; energy conservation is implied by the empirical fact that the [[Physical law|laws of physics]] do not change with time itself. Philosophically this can be stated as "nothing depends on time per se".
In other words, if the physical system is invariant under the [[continuous symmetry]] of [[time translation]] then its energy (which is [[canonical conjugate]] quantity to time) is conserved.  Conversely, systems which are not invariant under shifts in time (an example, systems with time dependent potential energy) do not exhibit conservation of energy&amp;nbsp;– unless we consider them to exchange energy with another, external system so that the theory of the enlarged system becomes time invariant again.  Conservation of energy for finite systems is valid in such physical theories as special relativity and quantum theory (including [[Quantum electrodynamics|QED]]) in the flat [[space-time]].

==Relativity==
With the discovery of [[special relativity]] by [[Henri Poincaré]] and [[Albert Einstein]], energy was proposed to be one component of an [[four-momentum|energy-momentum 4-vector]].  Each of the four components (one of energy and three of momentum) of this vector is separately conserved across time, in any closed system, as seen from any given [[inertial reference frame]].  Also conserved is the vector length ([[Minkowski space|Minkowski norm]]), which is the [[rest mass]] for single particles, and the [[invariant mass]] for systems of particles (where momenta and energy are separately summed before the length is calculated—see the article on [[invariant mass]]).

The relativistic energy of a single [[mass]]ive particle contains a term related to its [[rest mass]] in addition to its kinetic energy of motion.  In the limit of zero kinetic energy (or equivalently in the [[rest frame]]) of a massive particle, or else in the [[center of momentum frame]] for objects or systems which retain kinetic energy, the [[total energy]] of particle or object (including internal kinetic energy in systems) is related to its [[rest mass]] or its [[invariant mass]] via the famous equation &lt;math&gt;E=mc^2&lt;/math&gt;.

Thus, the rule of [[Mass in special relativity|''conservation of energy'' over time in special relativity]] continues to hold, so long as the [[frame of reference|reference frame]] of the observer is unchanged. This applies to the total energy of systems, although different observers disagree as to the energy value. Also conserved, and invariant to all observers, is the [[invariant mass]], which is the minimal system mass and energy that can be seen by any observer, and which is defined by the [[energy–momentum relation]].

In [[general relativity]], energy–momentum conservation is not well-defined except in certain special cases. Energy-momentum is typically expressed with the aid of a [[stress–energy–momentum pseudotensor]]. However, since pseudotensors are not tensors, they do not transform cleanly between reference frames. If the metric under consideration is static (that is, does not change with time) or asymptotically flat (that is, at an infinite distance away spacetime looks empty), then energy conservation holds without major pitfalls. In practice, some metrics such as the [[Friedmann–Lemaître–Robertson–Walker metric]] do not satisfy these constraints and energy conservation is not well defined.&lt;ref&gt;{{citeweb|url=http://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/physics/Relativity/GR/energy_gr.html|title=Is Energy Conserved in General Relativity?|authors=Michael Weiss and John Baez|accessdate=5 Jan 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The theory of general relativity leaves open the question of whether there is a conservation of energy for the entire universe.

==Quantum theory==
In [[quantum mechanics]], energy of a quantum system is described by a [[self-adjoint operator|self-adjoint]] (or Hermitian) operator called the [[Hamiltonian (quantum mechanics)|Hamiltonian]], which acts on the [[Hilbert space]] (or a space of [[wave functions]]) of the system. If the Hamiltonian is a time-independent operator, emergence probability of the measurement result does not change in time over the  evolution of the system. Thus the expectation value of energy is also time independent. The local energy conservation in quantum field theory is ensured by the quantum [[Noether's theorem]] for energy-momentum tensor operator. Note that due to the lack of the (universal) time operator in quantum theory, the uncertainty relations for time and energy are not fundamental in contrast to the position-momentum uncertainty principle, and merely holds in specific cases (see [[Uncertainty principle]]). Energy at each fixed time can in principle be exactly measured without any trade-off in precision forced by the time-energy uncertainty relations. Thus the conservation of energy in time is a well defined concept even in quantum mechanics.

In [[psychology]], '''dissociation''' is any of a wide array of experiences from mild [[Emotional detachment|detachment]] from immediate surroundings to more severe detachment from physical and emotional experiences. The major characteristic of all dissociative phenomena involves a detachment from [[reality]], rather than a loss of reality as in [[psychosis]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Dell P.

Dissociation is commonly displayed on a [[Continuum (measurement)|continuum]].&lt;ref name="Dell2009"&gt;{{cite book | authors = Dell, P. F., &amp; O'Neil, J.

Further along the continuum are non-pathological [[altered states of consciousness]].&lt;ref name="Dell2009"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | authors = Lynn S &amp; Rhue JW | year = 1994 | title = Dissociation: clinical and theoretical perspectives | publisher = [[Guilford Press]]|isbn=978-0-89862-186-0 | page = 19|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=BWLockQL714C&amp;pg=PA19 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | authors = Van der Kolk, B.

More pathological dissociation involves [[dissociative disorder]]s, including [[dissociative fugue]] and [[depersonalization disorder]] with or without alterations in personal identity or sense of self. These alterations can include: a sense that self or the world is unreal ([[depersonalization]] and [[derealization]]); a loss of memory ([[amnesia]]); forgetting identity or assuming a new self (fugue); and separate streams of consciousness, identity and self ([[dissociative identity disorder]], formerly termed multiple personality disorder) and [[complex post-traumatic stress disorder]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Coons PM |title=Psychogenic or dissociative fugue: a clinical investigation of five cases |journal=Psychological Reports |volume=84 |issue=3 Pt 1 |pages=881–6 |date=June 1999 |pmid=10408212 |doi= 10.2466/PR0.84.3.881-886|url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Kritchevsky |first1= M |last2= Chang |first2= J |last3= Squire |first3= LR |title=Functional Amnesia: Clinical Description and Neuropsychological Profile of 10 Cases |journal=Learning and Memory |volume=11|issue= 2 |pages=213–26 |year=2004 |pmid=15054137 |pmc=379692 |doi=10.1101/lm.71404 |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although some dissociative disruptions involve amnesia, other dissociative events do not.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title = The measurement of dissociation in normal and clinical populations: meta-analytic validation of the dissociative experiences scale (DES) | journal = Clinical Psychology Review | last1 = Van IJzendoorn |first1= MH |last2=Schuengel |first2= C | volume = 16 | issue = 5 | pages = 365–382 | doi = 10.1016/0272-7358(96)00006-2 | year = 1996 | url = https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0272735896000062}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dissociative disorders are typically experienced as startling, autonomous intrusions into the person's usual ways of responding or functioning. Due to their unexpected and largely inexplicable nature, they tend to be quite unsettling.

== History ==
[[French people|French]] philosopher and [[psychologist]] [[Pierre Janet]] (1859–1947) is considered to be the author of the concept of dissociation.&lt;ref name = Ellenberger&gt;{{cite book |last=Ellenberger | first = H. F. |title=The Discovery of the Unconscious: The History and Evolution of Dynamic Psychiatry |publisher=BasicBooks |location=New York |year=1970 |pages= |isbn=0-465-01673-1 |oclc= |doi= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Contrary to some conceptions of dissociation, Janet did not believe that dissociation was a psychological defense.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Janet | first = P | authorlink = Pierre Janet |origyear= 1893/1901 |year= 1977 | title = The Mental State of Hystericals: A Study of Mental Stigmata and Mental Accidents | location = Washington, DC | publisher = University Publications of America | url = https://books.google.com/?id=6OctAAAAIAAJ | isbn = 0-89093-166-6 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Janet | first= Pierre | authorlink = Pierre Janet | origyear = 1920/1929 |year= 1965 | title = The major symptoms of hysteria | url = https://books.google.com/?id=yyQ6AAAAMAAJ | location = New York | publisher = Hafner Publishing Company | isbn = 1-4325-0431-2 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Psychological [[defense mechanism]]s belong to Freud's theory of [[psychoanalysis]], not to Janetian psychology.  Janet claimed that dissociation occurred only in persons who had a constitutional weakness of mental functioning that led to [[hysteria]] when they were [[Stress (biological)|stressed]]. Although it is true that many of Janet's [[Case study|case histories]] described traumatic experiences, he never considered dissociation to be a defense against those experiences. Quite the opposite: Janet insisted that dissociation was a mental or cognitive deficit. Accordingly, he considered trauma to be one of many stressors that could worsen the already-impaired "mental efficiency" of a hysteric, thereby generating a cascade of hysterical (in today's language, "dissociative") symptoms.&lt;ref name = Ellenberger/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = McDougall | first = W | year = 1926| title = Outline of abnormal psychology| url = https://books.google.com/?id=86pWAAAAMAAJ  | location = New York | publisher = [[Charles Scribner's Sons]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Mitchell | first = TW | year = 1921 | title = The Psychology of Medicine | location = London | publisher = Methuen | isbn = 0-8274-4240-8 | url = https://books.google.com/?id=k1cwAAAACAAJ}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Mitchell | first = TW | origyear = 1923 |year= 2007 | title = Medical Psychology and Psychical Research | location = New York | publisher = [[E. P. Dutton]] | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=pxsZIg6_yhMC| isbn = 1-4067-3500-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although there was great interest in dissociation during the last two decades of the nineteenth century (especially in France and England), this interest rapidly waned with the coming of the new century.&lt;ref name=Ellenberger/&gt; Even Janet largely turned his attention to other matters.

On the other hand, there was a sharp peak in interest in dissociation in America from 1890 to 1910, especially in Boston as reflected in the work of [[William James]], [[Boris Sidis]], [[Morton Prince]], and [[William McDougall (psychologist)|William McDougall]]. Nevertheless, even in America, interest in dissociation rapidly succumbed to the surging academic interest in psychoanalysis and behaviorism.

For most of the twentieth century, there was little interest in dissociation. Despite this, a review of 76 previously published cases (from 1790’s – 1942),was published in 1944, describing clinical phenomena consistent with that seen by Janet and by therapists today&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Taylor|first=WS|last2=Martin|first2=Mabel F|date=1944|title=Multiple Personality|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1037/h0063634|journal=The Journal of Abnormal and Social Psychology|volume=39(3)|pages=281-300|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;. In 1971 Bowers and her colleagues&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Bowers|first=MK|last2=Brecher-Marer|first2=Sylvia|last3=Newton|first3=Bernauer. W.|last4=Piotrowski|first4=Zygmunt|last5=Spyer|first5=Thea C.|last6=Taylor|first6=William S.|last7=Watkins|first7=John G|date=1971|title=Therapy of Multiple Personality|url=|journal=The International Journal of Clinical and Experimental Hypnosis|volume=14(2)|pages=57-65|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; presented a detailed, and still quite valid, treatment article. The authors of this article included leading thinkers of their time – [[John G. Watkins]] (who developed [[Ego-state therapy]]) and [[Zygmunt A. Piotrowski]] (famed for his work on the  [[Rorschach test|Rorschach]] test). Further interest in dissociation was evoked when [[Ernest Hilgard]] (1977) published his neodissociation theory in the 1970s. During the 1970's and 1980's an increasing number of clinicians and researchers wrote about dissociation, particularly multiple personality disorder.&lt;ref&gt;Van der Hart, O &amp; Dorahy, M.J.  (2009). History of the concept of Dissociation. In Dell, P.F. &amp; O'Neil J.A. (Eds). ''Dissociation and the Dissociative Disorders: DSM V and beyond,'' Routledge, New York&lt;/ref&gt;. 

[[Carl Jung]] described pathological manifestations of dissociation as special or extreme cases of the normal operation of the psyche. This structural dissociation, opposing tension, and hierarchy of basic [[attitude (psychology)|attitudes]] and functions in normal individual consciousness is the basis of Jung's ''[[Psychological Types]]''.&lt;ref name=Jung1991&gt;{{cite book |last = Jung |first= C.G. |authorlink= Carl Jung | year = 1991 | title = Psychological Types | publisher = Routledge London | isbn = 978-0-7100-6299-4 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He theorized that dissociation is a natural necessity for consciousness to operate in one faculty unhampered by the demands of its opposite.

Attention to dissociation as a clinical feature has been growing in recent years as knowledge of [[post-traumatic stress disorder]] increased, due to interest in [[dissociative identity disorder]], and as [[neuroimaging]] research and population studies show its relevance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Scaer | first = Robert C. | title = The Body Bears the Burden: Trauma, Dissociation, and Disease | publisher = Haworth Medical Press | year = 2001 | location = Binghamton, NY | pages = 97–126 | isbn = 0-7890-1246-4 | url = https://books.google.com/?id=C30EbO7GDMIC&amp;pg=PA97}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Historically the psychopathological concept of dissociation has also another different root: the conceptualization of [[Eugen Bleuler]] that looks into dissociation related to schizophrenia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |editor-first1= M |editor-last1= Di Fiorino |editor-first2= ML |editor-last2= Figueira |title= Dissociation.

== Diagnosis ==
{{Main|Dissociative disorder}}
Dissociation in community samples is most commonly measured by the [[Dissociative Experiences Scale]]. The ''[[Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders|DSM-IV]]'' considers symptoms such as [[depersonalization]], [[derealization]] and [[psychogenic amnesia]] to be core features of [[dissociative disorder]]s.&lt;ref name="DissociativeDisorders"&gt;[[Dissociative disorder|Dissociative Disorders ( Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition )]]{{dead link|date=December 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;  However, in the normal population, dissociative experiences that are not clinically significant are highly prevalent with 60% to 65% of the respondents indicating that they have had some dissociative experiences.&lt;ref name=OccrRef04102007&gt;{{cite journal |last1= Waller |first1= NG |last2= Putnam |first2= FW |last3= Carlson |first3= EB | year = 1996 | title = Types of dissociation and dissociative types: A taxometric analysis of dissociative experiences | journal = Psychological Methods | volume = 1 |issue= 3 | pages = 300–21 | url = http://www.psych.umn.edu/faculty/waller/classes/mult06/taxometrics/wallerputnam.pdf  | accessdate = 2008-01-31 | doi = 10.1037/1082-989X.1.3.300 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080829105150/http://www.psych.umn.edu/faculty/waller/classes/mult06/taxometrics/wallerputnam.pdf &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = 2008-08-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The [[Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV#SCID-D|SCID-D]] is a structured interview used to assess and diagnose dissociation.

== Relation to trauma and abuse ==
Dissociation has been described as one of a constellation of symptoms experienced by some victims of multiple forms of childhood [[Psychological trauma|trauma]], including [[physical abuse|physical]], [[psychological abuse|psychological]], and [[child sexual abuse|sexual abuse]].&lt;ref name=salter&gt;{{cite book|title=Transforming Trauma: A Guide to Understanding and Treating Adult Survivors |first=Anna C. |last=Salter |first2=Hilary |last2= Eldridge |page=220 | year=1995 |publisher=Sage Publications |isbn= 0-8039-5509-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Myers&gt;{{cite book |title=The APSAC Handbook on Child Maltreatment |edition= 2nd |first=John E.B. |last=Myers |page=63 |publisher=Sage Publications |year=2002 |isbn= 0-7619-1992-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is supported by studies which suggest that dissociation is correlated with a history of trauma.&lt;ref name="pmid8659645"&gt;{{cite journal | author = van der Kolk, BA| title = Dissociation, somatization, and affect dysregulation: The complexity of adaptation of trauma | journal = American Journal of Psychiatry | volume = 153 | issue = 7 Suppl | pages = 83–93 | year = 1996 | pmid = 8659645 | doi = 10.1176/ajp.153.7.83 | url = http://ajp.psychiatryonline.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&amp;pmid=8659645 | accessdate = 2008-05-13|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Dissociation appears to have a high [[Specificity (tests)|specificity]] and a low [[Sensitivity (tests)|sensitivity]] to having a self-reported history of trauma, which means that dissociation is much more common among those who are traumatized, yet at the same time there are many people who have suffered from trauma but who do not show dissociative symptoms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Briere |first=J |title=Dissociative symptoms and trauma exposure: Specificity, affect dysregulation, and posttraumatic stress |journal=Journal of Nervous and Mental Disorders |volume=194 |issue=2 |pages=78–82 |year=2006 |pmid=16477184 |doi=10.1097/01.nmd.0000198139.47371.54 |url=http://www.johnbriere.com/JNMD%2006%20paper.html |access-date=2008-05-16 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080820094201/http://www.johnbriere.com/JNMD%2006%20paper.html |archive-date=2008-08-20 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Adult dissociation when combined with a history of [[child abuse]] and otherwise interpersonal violence-related [[posttraumatic stress disorder]] (PTSD) has been shown to contribute to disturbances in parenting behavior, such as exposure of young children to violent media. Such behavior may contribute to cycles of familial violence and trauma.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1= Schechter |first1= DS |last2= Gross |first2= A |last3= Willheim |first3= E |last4= McCaw |first4= J |last5= Turner |first5= JB |last6= Myers |first6= MM |last7= Zeanah |first7= CH |last8= Gleason |first8= MM |authorlink1= Daniel Schechter |displayauthors= 4 |title= Is maternal PTSD associated with greater exposure of very young children to violent media? |journal= Journal of Traumatic Stress |year= 2009 |pages= 658–62 |pmid= 19924819 |pmc= 2798921 |doi= 10.1002/jts.20472 |volume=22|issue= 6 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Symptoms of dissociation resulting from trauma may include [[depersonalization]], [[psychological numbing]], [[Apathy|disengagement]], or amnesia regarding the events of the abuse. It has been hypothesized that dissociation may provide a temporarily effective defense mechanism in cases of severe trauma; however, in the long term, dissociation is associated with decreased psychological functioning and adjustment.&lt;ref name=Myers/&gt;

Other symptoms sometimes found along with dissociation in victims of traumatic abuse (often referred to as "sequelae to abuse") include anxiety, PTSD, low [[self-esteem]], somatization, depression, chronic pain, interpersonal dysfunction, substance abuse, self-harm and suicidal ideation or actions.&lt;ref name=salter/&gt;&lt;ref name=Myers/&gt;&lt;ref name=briere1992&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://www.johnbriere.com/methodological%20csa%20jccp%201992.pdf |title=Methodological issues in the study of sexual abuse effects |last=Briere |first=J |journal=Journal of Consulting and Clinical Psychology |year=1992 |pages=196–203 |volume=60 |pmid=1592948 |doi=10.1037/0022-006X.60.2.196 |issue=2 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080911152635/http://www.johnbriere.com/methodological%20csa%20jccp%201992.pdf |archivedate=2008-09-11 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  These symptoms may lead the victim to present the symptoms as the source of the problem.&lt;ref name=salter/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="16775">'''Earth systems engineering and management''' (ESEM) is a discipline used to analyze, design, engineer and manage complex [[Natural environment|environmental]] [[system]]s. It entails a wide range of subject areas including [[anthropology]], [[engineering]], [[environmental science]], [[ethics]] and [[philosophy]]. At its core, ESEM looks to "rationally design and manage coupled human-natural systems in a highly integrated and ethical fashion" &lt;ref name = "Gorman, 2004"&gt;Gorman, Michael. (2004). ''Syllabus Spring Semester 2004''. Retrieved October 29, 2005 from http://repo-nt.tcc.virginia.edu/classes/ESEM/syllabus.html.&lt;/ref&gt; ESEM is a newly emerging area of study that has taken root at the University of Virginia, Cornell and other universities throughout the United States. Founders of Earth Systems Engineering &amp; Management are [[Braden Allenby]] and Michael Gorman.&lt;ref&gt;Dr. Michael Gorman is currently a professor at the University of Virginia. He is with the School of Engineering and Applied Science in the department of Science, Technology and Society.  He teaches STS 300, Earth Systems Engineering &amp; Management, STS 401, Western Technology and Culture and STS 402, The Engineer in Society. Dr. Gorman's research interests include experimental simulations of scientific reasoning, described in his book Simulating Science (Indiana UP, 1992) and case studies of ethics, invention and discovery, which are described in his book Transforming Nature (Kluwer, 1998). He is the faculty advisor for a graduate program,  Societal and Ethical Dimensions of Systems Engineering. (Excerpted from http://lisa.sts.virginia.edu/stshome/tiki-index.php?page=Michael+Gorman)&lt;/ref&gt;
In the UK, the [http://www.ncl.ac.uk/ceser Centre for Earth Systems Engineering Research] (CESER) at Newcastle University has a large ESEM programme, led by [http://www.ncl.ac.uk/ceg/staff/profile/richard.dawson Professor Richard Dawson].&lt;ref&gt; [http://www.ncl.ac.uk/ceg/staff/profile/richard.dawson Richard Dawson] is Professor of Earth Systems Engineering at Newcastle University and Director of the Centre for Earth Systems Engineering Research.  His work has focused on developing adaptation solutions to ensure of structure and cities are resilient and sustainable in the face of intensifying global change.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Introduction to ESEM==
For centuries now, mankind has been utilizing the earth and its natural resources to advance civilization and develop technology.  "As a principle {{sic}} result of Industrial Revolutions and associated changes in human demographics, technology systems, cultures, and economic systems have been the evolution of an Earth in which the dynamics of major natural systems are increasingly dominated by human activity".&lt;ref name = "Gorman, 2004"/&gt;

In many ways, ESEM views the earth as a human artifact. "In order to maintain continued stability of both natural and human systems, we need to develop the ability to rationally design and manage coupled human-natural systems in a highly integrated and ethical fashion- an Earth Systems Engineering and Management (ESEM) capability".&lt;ref name = "Gorman, 2004"/&gt; 

Over the past five years, the concept of Earth Systems Engineering and Management has been developed by a few individuals. One of particular note is [[Braden Allenby]].  Allenby holds that the foundation upon which ESEM is built is the notion that “the Earth, as it now exists, is a product of human design”.&lt;ref name = "Allenby, 2005"&gt;* Allenby, B. R. (2005). Reconstructing earth : Technology and environment in the age of humans. Washington, DC: Island Press. From https://www.loc.gov/catdir/toc/ecip059/2005006241.html&lt;/ref&gt; In fact there are no longer any natural systems left in the world, “there are no places left on Earth that don’t fall under humanity’s shadow”.&lt;ref name = "Allenby, 2000"&gt;Allenby, B. R. (2000, Winter). Earth systems engineering and management. IEEE Technology and Society Magazine, 0278-0079(Winter) 10-24.&lt;/ref&gt; “So the question is not, as some might wish, whether we should begin ESEM, because we have been doing it for a long time, albeit unintentionally.

The issue is whether we will assume the ethical responsibility to do ESEM rationally and responsibly”.&lt;ref name = "Allenby, 2005"/&gt; Unlike the traditional engineering and management process “which assume a high degree of knowledge and certainty about the systems behavior and a defined endpoint to the process,” ESEM “will be in constant dialog with [the systems], as they – and we and our cultures – change and coevolve together into the future”.&lt;ref name = "Allenby, 2005"/&gt; ESEM is a new concept, however there are a number of fields “such as [[industrial ecology]], [[adaptive management]], and [[systems engineering]] that can be relied on to enable rapid progress in developing” ESEM as a discipline.&lt;ref name = "Allenby, 2005"/&gt;

The premise of ESEM is that science and technology can provide successful and lasting solutions to human-created problems such as environmental pollution and climate-change.  This assumption has recently been challenged in ''Techno-Fix: Why Technology Won’t Save Us or the Environment''&lt;ref&gt;Huesemann, Michael H., and Joyce A. Huesemann (2011). [http://www.newtechnologyandsociety.org ''Technofix: Why Technology Won’t Save Us or the Environment''], New Society Publishers, Gabriola Island, British Columbia, Canada, {{ISBN|0865717044}}.&lt;/ref&gt; ESEM, as all technological control and manipulation, causes unintended and inherently unavoidable negative consequences. Furthermore, due to the limitations of reductionist science, it is inherently impossible to predict all negative impacts of ESEM. Consequently, ESEM can be considered a high-risk technological fix, which attempts to address symptoms of the planetary environmental crisis rather than root causes, which are dysfunctional human behavior such as [[human overpopulation]] and [[overconsumption]].

==ESEM: Topics==
=== Adaptive management ===
[[Adaptive management]] is a key aspect of ESEM.  Adaptive management is a way of approaching environmental management.  It assumes that there is a great deal of uncertainty in environmental systems and holds that there is never a final solution to an earth systems problem.  Therefore, once action has been taken, the Earth Systems Engineer will need to be in constant dialogue with the system, watching for changes and how the system evolves. This way of monitoring and managing ecosystems accepts nature's inherent uncertainty and embraces it by never concluding to one certain cure to a problem.

===Earth Systems Engineering===
Earth [[Systems engineering]] is essentially the use of systems analysis methods in the examination of environmental problems.  When analyzing complex environmental systems, there are numerous data sets, [[Stakeholder (corporate)|stakeholders]] and variables.  It is therefore appropriate to approach such problems with a systems analysis method.  Essentially there are “six major phases of a properly-conducted system study”.&lt;ref name = "Gibson, 1991"&gt;* Gibson, J. E. (1991). How to do A systems analysis and systems analyst decalog. In W. T. Scherer (Ed.), (Fall 2003 ed.) (pp. 29-238). Department of Systems and Information Engineering: U of Virginia. Retrieved October 29, 2005&lt;/ref&gt; The six phases are as follows:
#Determine Goals of System
#Establish Criteria for Ranking Alternative Candidates
#Develop Alternatives Solutions
#Rank Alternative Candidates
#Iterate
#Action

Part of the systems analysis process includes determining the goals of the system.  The key components of goal development include the development of a Descriptive Scenario, a Normative Scenario and Transitive Scenario.&lt;ref name = "Gibson, 1991"/&gt; Essentially, the Descriptive Scenario “describe[s] the situation as it is [and] tell[s] how it got to be that way” (Gibson, 1991).  Another important part of the Descriptive Scenario is how it “point[s] out the good features and the unacceptable elements of the status quo”.&lt;ref name = "Gibson, 1991"/&gt; Next, the Normative Scenario shows the final outcome or the way the system should operate under ideal conditions once action has been taken.&lt;ref name = "Gibson, 1991"/&gt;  For the Earth Systems approach, the “Normative Scenario” will involve the most complicated analysis.  The Normative Scenario will deal with stakeholders, creating a common trading zone or location for the free exchange of ideas to come up with a solution of where a system may be restored to or just how exactly a system should be modified.  Finally the Transitive scenario comes up with the actual process of changing a system from a Descriptive state to a Normative state.  Often, there is not one final solution, as noted in [[adaptive management]].  Typically an iterative process ensues as variables and inputs change and the system coevolves with the analysis.

===Environmental science===
{{main|Environmental science}}
When examining complex ecologic systems there is an inherent need for the Earth Systems Engineer to have a strong understanding of how natural processes function.  A training in Environmental Science will be crucial to fully understand the possible unintended and undesired effects of a proposed earth systems design.  Such fundamental topics such as the carbon cycle or the [[water cycle]] are pivotal processes that need to be understood.

===Ethics &amp; Sustainability===
At the heart of ESEM is the social, ethical and moral responsibility of the Earth Systems Engineer to stakeholders and to the natural system being engineered, to come up with an objective Transitive and Normative scenario.  “ESEM is the cultural and ethical context itself”.&lt;ref name = "Allenby, 2005"/&gt; The Earth Systems Engineer will be expected to explore the ethical implications of proposed solutions.

“The perspective of environmental sustainability requires that we ask ourselves how each interaction with the natural environment will affect, and be judged by, our children in the future” ”.&lt;ref name = "Newton, 2003"&gt;Newton, L. H. (2003). Ethics and sustainability : Sustainable development and the moral life. Upper Saddle River, N.J.: Prentice Hall.&lt;/ref&gt; “There is an increasing awareness that the process of development, left to itself, can cause irreversible damage to the environment, and that the resultant net addition to wealth and human welfare may very well be negative, if not catastrophic”.&lt;ref name = "Newton, 2003"/&gt;  With this notion in mind, there is now a new goal of sustainable environment-friendly development.&lt;ref name = "Newton, 2003"/&gt; [[Sustainable development]] is an important part to developing appropriate ESEM solutions to complex environmental problems.

===Industrial ecology===
{{main|Industrial ecology}}
Industrial ecology is the notion that major manufacturing and industrial processes need to shift from open loop systems to closed loop systems. This is essentially the recycling of waste to make new products.  This reduces refuse and increases the effectiveness of resources.  ESEM looks to minimize the impact of industrial processes on the environment, therefore the notion of recycling of industrial products is important to ESEM.

==Case Study: Florida Everglades==
The [[Florida Everglades]] system is a prime example of a complex ecological system that underwent an ESEM analysis.

;Background
The Florida Everglades is located in southern Florida.  The ecosystem is essentially a subtropical fresh water marsh composed of a variety of flora and fauna.&lt;ref name="Everglades, 2004"&gt;“Everglades.” Comprehensive Everglades Restoration Plan. 10 April 2004. {{cite web |url=http://www.evergladesplan.org/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2005-12-14 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20051214102114/http://www.evergladesplan.org/ |archivedate=2005-12-14 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Of particular note is the [[saw grass]] and ridge slough formations that make the Everglades unique.&lt;ref name="Davis, 1997"&gt;(Davis, 1997).&lt;/ref&gt;  Over the course of the past century mankind has had a rising presence in this region.  Currently, all of the eastern shore of Florida is developed and the population has increased to over 6 million residents.&lt;ref name = "Everglades, 2004"/&gt; This increased presence over the years has resulted in the channeling and redirecting of water from its traditional path through the Everglades and into the Gulf of Mexico and Atlantic Ocean.  With this there have been a variety of deleterious effects upon the Florida Everglades.

;Descriptive Scenario
By 1993, the Everglades had been affected by numerous human developments.  The water flow and quality had been affected by the construction of canals and levees, to the series of elevated highways running through the Everglades to the expansive Everglades Agricultural Area that had contaminated the Everglades with high amounts of nitrogen.&lt;ref name = "Everglades, 2004"/&gt;  The result of this reduced flow of water was dramatic. There was a 90 - 95% reduction in wading bird populations, declining fish populations and salt water intrusion into the ecosystem.&lt;ref name="Davis, 1997"/&gt; If the Florida Everglades were to remain a US landmark, action needed to be taken.

;Normative Scenario
It was in 1993 that the Army Corps of Engineers analyzed the system.&lt;ref name = "Everglades, 2004"/&gt;  They determined that an ideal situation would be to "get the water right".&lt;ref name = "Everglades, 2004"/&gt; In doing so there would be a better flow through the Everglades and a reduced number of canals and levees sending water to tide.

;Transitive Scenario
It was from the development of the Normative Scenario, that the Army Corps of Engineers developed CERP, the Comprehensive Everglades Restoration Plan.&lt;ref name = "Everglades, 2004"/&gt;  In the plan they created a time line of projects to be completed, the estimated cost and the ultimate results of improving the ecosystem by having native flora and fauna prosper.&lt;ref name = "Everglades, 2004"/&gt;  They also outline the human benefits of the project.  Not only will the solution be sustainable, as future generations will be able to enjoy the Everglades, but the correction of the water flow and through the creation of storage facilities will reduce the occurrence of droughts and water shortages in southern Florida.&lt;ref name = "Everglades, 2004"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2440">The [[optical|optics]] term '''encircled energy''' refers to a measure of concentration of [[energy]] in an optical [[image]], or projected [[laser beam|laser]] at a given range.  If a single star is brought to its sharpest [[Focus (optics)|focus]] by a [[lens (optics)|lens]] giving the smallest [[image]] possible with that given lens (called a [[point spread function]] or PSF), calculation of the encircled energy of the resulting image gives the distribution of energy in that PSF.  

Encircled energy is calculated by first determining the total energy of the PSF over the full image plane, then determining the [[centroid]] of the PSF.  Circles of increasing [[radius]] are then created at that centroid and the PSF energy within each circle is calculated and divided by the total energy.  As the circle increases in radius, more of the PSF energy is enclosed, until the circle is sufficiently large to completely contain all the PSF energy.  The encircled energy curve thus ranges from zero to one.  

A typical criterion for encircled energy (EE) is the radius of the PSF at which either 50% or 80% of the energy is encircled.  This is a [[linear]] dimension, typically in [[micrometre|micrometer]]s.  When divided by the lens or mirror focal length, this gives the angular size of the PSF, typically expressed in [[Minute of arc|arc-seconds]] when specifying [[astronomical]] optical system performance.

Encircled energy is also used to quantify the spreading of a laser beam at a given distance.  All laser beams spread due to the necessarily limited [[aperture]] of the optical system projecting the beam.  As in star image PSF's, the linear spreading of the beam expressed as encircled energy is divided by the projection distance to give the angular spreading.

An alternative to encircled energy is ensquared energy, typically used when quantifying image sharpness for digital imaging cameras using [[pixels]].

In [[mathematics]], it can be shown that every [[function (mathematics)|function]] can be written as the composite of a [[surjective]] function followed by an [[injective]] function. '''Factorization systems''' are a generalization of this situation in [[category theory]].

==Definition==

A '''factorization system''' (''E'', ''M'') for a [[category (category theory)|category]] '''C''' consists of two classes of [[morphisms]] ''E'' and ''M'' of '''C''' such that:
#''E'' and ''M'' both contain all [[isomorphisms]] of '''C''' and are closed under composition.
#Every morphism ''f'' of '''C''' can be factored as &lt;math&gt;f=m\circ e&lt;/math&gt; for some morphisms &lt;math&gt;e\in E&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;m\in M&lt;/math&gt;.
#The factorization is ''functorial'': if &lt;math&gt;u&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;v&lt;/math&gt; are two morphisms such that &lt;math&gt;vme=m'e'u&lt;/math&gt; for some morphisms &lt;math&gt;e, e'\in E&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;m, m'\in M&lt;/math&gt;, then there exists a unique morphism &lt;math&gt;w&lt;/math&gt; making the following diagram commute:
[[Image:Factorization_system_functoriality.png|center]]


''Remark:'' &lt;math&gt;(u,v)&lt;/math&gt; is a morphism from &lt;math&gt;me&lt;/math&gt; to &lt;math&gt;m'e'&lt;/math&gt; in the [[Comma_category#Arrow_category|arrow category]].

== Orthogonality ==

Two morphisms &lt;math&gt;e&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;m&lt;/math&gt; are said to be ''orthogonal'', denoted &lt;math&gt;e\downarrow m&lt;/math&gt;, if for every pair of morphisms &lt;math&gt;u&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;v&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;ve=mu&lt;/math&gt; there is a unique morphism &lt;math&gt;w&lt;/math&gt; such that the diagram

[[Image:Factorization_system_orthogonality.png|center]]

commutes. This notion can be extended to define the orthogonals of sets of morphisms by

:&lt;math&gt;H^\uparrow=\{e\quad|\quad\forall h\in H, e\downarrow h\}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;H^\downarrow=\{m\quad|\quad\forall h\in H, h\downarrow m\}.&lt;/math&gt;

Since in a factorization system &lt;math&gt;E\cap M&lt;/math&gt; contains all the isomorphisms, the condition (3) of the definition is equivalent to
:(3') &lt;math&gt;E\subset M^\uparrow&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;M\subset E^\downarrow.&lt;/math&gt;


''Proof:'' In the previous diagram (3), take &lt;math&gt; m:= id ,\  e' := id &lt;/math&gt; (identity on the appropriate object) and &lt;math&gt; m' := m &lt;/math&gt;.

== Equivalent definition ==
The pair &lt;math&gt;(E,M)&lt;/math&gt; of classes of morphisms of '''C''' is a factorization system if and only if it satisfies the following conditions:

#Every morphism ''f'' of '''C''' can be factored as &lt;math&gt;f=m\circ e&lt;/math&gt; with &lt;math&gt;e\in E&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;m\in M.&lt;/math&gt;
#&lt;math&gt;E=M^\uparrow&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;M=E^\downarrow.&lt;/math&gt;

== Weak factorization systems ==
Suppose ''e'' and ''m'' are two morphisms in a category '''C'''. Then ''e'' has the ''[[right lifting property|left lifting property]]'' with respect to ''m'' (resp. ''m'' has the ''[[right lifting property]]'' with respect to ''e'') when for every pair of morphisms ''u'' and ''v'' such that ''ve''=''mu'' there is a morphism ''w'' such that the following diagram commutes. The difference with orthogonality is that ''w'' is not necessarily unique.

[[Image:Factorization_system_orthogonality.png|center]]

A '''weak factorization system''' (''E'', ''M'') for a category '''C''' consists of two classes of morphisms ''E'' and ''M'' of '''C''' such that :
#The class ''E'' is exactly the class of morphisms having the left lifting property wrt the morphisms of ''M''.
#The class ''M'' is exactly the class of morphisms having the right lifting property wrt the morphisms of ''E''.
#Every morphism ''f'' of '''C''' can be factored as &lt;math&gt;f=m\circ e&lt;/math&gt; for some morphisms &lt;math&gt;e\in E&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;m\in M&lt;/math&gt;.

[[File:Concorde on Bristol.jpg|thumb|[[Concorde]] in its final flight. The extremely high fineness ratio of the fuselage is evident.]]
[[File:Questair Venture.jpg|thumb|right|[[Questair Venture]], with an egg-shaped, very-low-fineness-ratio fuselage]]

In [[naval architecture]] and [[aerospace engineering]], the '''fineness ratio''' is the ratio of the length of a body to its maximum width. Shapes that are short and wide have a low fineness ratio, those that are long and narrow have high fineness ratios. Aircraft that spend time at [[supersonic]] speeds, e.g. the [[Concorde]], generally have high fineness ratios.

At speeds below [[critical mach]], one of the primary forms of drag is [[skin friction]]. As the name implies, this is drag caused by the interaction of the airflow with the aircraft's skin.  To minimize this drag, the aircraft should be designed to minimize the exposed skin area, or "wetted surface". One solution to this problem is constructing an "egg shaped" fuselage, for example as used on the home-built [[Questair Venture]].

Theoretical ideal fineness ratios in subsonic aircraft are typically found at about 6:1, however this may be compromised by other design considerations such as seating or freight size requirements. Because a higher fineness fuselage can have reduced tail surfaces, this ideal ratio can practically be increased to 8:1.&lt;ref name="GBooksf"&gt;{{cite web|url = https://books.google.ca/books?id=_FBLtC3qpr4C&amp;pg=PA36&amp;dq=fineness+ratio&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=fineness%20ratio&amp;f=false|title = Airplane Design, Part 3|accessdate = 14 June 2016|last = Roskam|first = Jan|year = 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Most aircraft have fineness ratios significantly greater than this, however. This is often due to the competing need to place the tail control surfaces at the end of a longer [[moment arm]] to increase their effectiveness. Reducing the length of the fuselage would require larger controls, which would offset the drag savings from using the ideal fineness ratio. An example of a high-performance design with an imperfect fineness ratio is the [[Lancair]]. In other cases, the designer is forced to use a non-ideal design due to outside factors such as seating arrangements or cargo pallet sizes. Modern [[airliner]]s often have fineness ratios much higher than ideal, a side effect of their cylindrical cross-section which is selected for strength, as well as providing a single width to simplify seating layout.

As an aircraft approaches the [[speed of sound]], [[shock wave]]s form on areas of greater curvature. These shock waves radiate away energy that the engines must supply, energy that does not go into making the aircraft go faster. This appears to be a new form of drag—referred to as [[wave drag]]—which peaks at about three times the drag at speeds even slightly below the [[critical mach]]. In order to minimize the wave drag, the curvature of the aircraft should be kept to a minimum, which implies much higher fineness ratios. This is why high-speed aircraft have long pointed noses and tails, and cockpit canopies that are flush to the fuselage line.

More technically, the best possible performance for a supersonic design is typified by two "perfect shapes", the [[Sears-Haack body]] which is pointed at both ends, or the [[von Kármán ogive]], which has a blunt tail. Examples of the latter design include the [[Concorde]], [[F-104 Starfighter]] and [[XB-70 Valkyrie]], although to some degree practically every post-World War II [[interceptor aircraft]] featured such a design. Missile designers are even less interested in low-speed performance, and missiles generally have higher fineness ratios than most aircraft.

The introduction of aircraft with higher fineness ratios also introduced a new form of instability, [[inertial coupling]]. As the engines and cockpit moved away from the aircraft's [[center of mass]], the roll inertia of these masses grew to be able to overwhelm the power of the aerodynamic surfaces. A variety of methods are used to combat this effect, including oversized controls and [[stability augmentation system]]s.

'''Fractal art''' is a form of [[algorithmic art]] created by calculating [[fractal]] objects and representing the calculation results as still images, animations, and [[Algorithmic composition|media]]. Fractal art developed from the mid-1980s onwards.&lt;ref name="fgad"&gt;{{cite book |title=Fractal geometry in architecture and design |last=Bovill |first=Carl |year=1996 |publisher=Birkhauser |location=Boston |isbn=0-8176-3795-8 |page=153 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=w5ptaiGsac4C |accessdate=28 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is a genre of [[computer art]] and [[digital art]] which are part of [[new media art]]. The [[mathematical beauty]] of fractals lies at the intersection of [[generative art]] and [[computer art]].  They combine to produce a type of [[abstract art]].

Fractal art (especially in the western world) is rarely drawn or painted by hand. It is usually created indirectly with the assistance of [[fractal-generating software]], iterating through three phases: setting parameters of appropriate fractal software; executing the possibly lengthy calculation; and evaluating the product. In some cases, other [[graphics software|graphics programs]] are used to further modify the images produced. This is called post-processing. Non-fractal imagery may also be integrated into the artwork.&lt;ref name="mra"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.casperjournal.com/article_bbe58a64-0b86-5e64-8fc5-459eafbe67fb.html |title=Meet Reginald Atkins, mathematical artist |author=Elysia Conner |date=February 25, 2009 |publisher=CasperJournal.com |accessdate=October 28, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Julia set]] and [[Mandelbrot set]]s can be considered as [[icon]]s of fractal art.&lt;ref name="hema"&gt;{{cite book |title=The heart of mathematics: an invitation to effective thinking |last=Burger |first=Edward B. |author2=Michael P.

It was assumed that fractal art could not have developed without computers because of the [[calculation|calculative]] capabilities they provide.&lt;ref name="dima"&gt;{{cite book |title=Digital Mantras: The languages of abstract and virtual worlds |last=Steven R. |first=Holtzman |year=1995 |publisher=MIT Press |isbn=0-262-58143-4 |page=241 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=gc5hnRuABy0C |accessdate=28 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Fractals are generated by applying [[Iteration|iterative]] methods to solving non-linear equations or [[polynomial equation]]s. Fractals are any of various extremely irregular curves or shapes for which any suitably chosen part is similar in shape to a given larger or smaller part when magnified or reduced to the same size.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/fractal Fractal - Definition].

There are many different kinds of fractal images and can be subdivided into several groups. 
* Fractals derived from standard geometry by using iterative transformations on an initial common figure like a straight line (the Cantor dust or the [[Koch snowflake|von Koch curve]]), a triangle (the [[Sierpinski triangle]]), or a cube (the [[Menger sponge]]). The first fractal figures invented near the end of the 19th and early 20th centuries belong to this group.
* IFS ([[iterated function systems]])
* [[Strange attractors]]
* [[Flame fractals|Fractal flame]]
* [[L-system]] fractals
* Fractals created by the iteration of complex [[polynomial]]s:  perhaps the most famous fractals.
* [[Newton fractal]]s, including [[Nova fractal]]s
* [[Quaternionic]] and (recently) hypernionic{{clarify||date=January 2014}} fractals&lt;ref&gt;[http://paulbourke.net/fractals/quatjulia/ Quaternion Julia Fractals]&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Fractal terrain]]s generated by random fractal processes&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.fractalus.com/fractal-art-faq/faq03.html#3a Fractal Art FAQ]&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Mandelbulb]]s are a kind of three dimensional fractal.

[[Fractal Expressionism]] is a term used to differentiate traditional visual art that incorporates fractal elements such as [[self-similarity]] for example.  Perhaps the best example of fractal expressionism is found in [[Jackson Pollock]]'s dripped patterns.  They have been analysed and found to contain a [[fractal dimension]] which has been attributed to his technique.&lt;ref name="coex"&gt;{{cite book |title=Complexity explained |last=Érdi |first=Péter |authorlink=Péter Érdi|year=2008 |publisher=Springer |isbn=3-540-35777-7 |page=214 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JwgpLvknc8wC |accessdate=29 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Fractals of all kinds have been used as the basis for digital art and animation. High resolution color graphics became increasingly available at scientific research labs in the mid-1980s.  Scientific forms of art, including fractal art, have developed separately from [[mainstream]] culture.&lt;ref name="ciem"&gt;{{cite book |title=Critical issues in electronic media |last=Penny |first=Simon |year=1995 |publisher=State University of New York Press |isbn=0-7914-2317-4 |pages=81–82 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vzFJnyBjaLMC |accessdate=29 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Starting with 2-dimensional details of fractals, such as the Mandelbrot Set, fractals have found artistic application in fields as varied as texture generation, plant growth simulation and landscape generation.

Fractals are sometimes combined with [[evolutionary algorithms]], either by iteratively choosing good-looking specimens in a set of random variations of a fractal artwork and producing new variations, to avoid dealing with cumbersome or unpredictable parameters, or collectively, as in the [[Electric Sheep]] project, where people use [[fractal flame]]s rendered with [[distributed computing]] as their [[screensaver]] and "rate" the flame they are viewing, influencing the server, which reduces the traits of the undesirables, and increases those of the desirables to produce a computer-generated, community-created piece of art.

Many fractal images are admired because of their perceived [[Principles of art#Harmony|harmony]]. This is typically achieved by the [[pattern]]s which emerge from the [[Principles of art#Balance|balance]] of order and [[Chaos theory|chaos]]. Similar qualities have been described in [[Chinese painting]] and [[Penjing|miniature trees and rockeries]].&lt;ref name="caftc"&gt;{{cite book |title=Chaos, complexity, curriculum and culture |editor1-first=William E. |editor1-last=Doll, Jr |editor2-first=Jayne |editor2-last=Fleener |editor3-first=Donna |editor3-last=Trueit |editor4-first=John |display-editors = 3 |editor4-last=St. Julien |last=Wang |first=Hongyu |chapter=Chinese aesthetics, Fractals and the Tao of Curriculum |year=2005 |publisher=Peter Lang Publishing |location=New York |isbn=978-0-8204-6780-1 |page=301 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=fROt7Yjz3xgC |accessdate=28 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{main|Fractal landscape}}
The first fractal image that was intended to be a work of art was probably the famous one on the cover of ''[[Scientific American]]'', August 1985. This image showed a [[landscape]] formed from the potential function on the domain outside the (usual) [[Mandelbrot set]]. However, as the potential function grows fast near the boundary of the Mandelbrot set, it was necessary for the creator to let the landscape grow downwards, so that it looked as if the Mandelbrot set was a [[plateau]] atop a mountain with steep sides. The same technique was used a year after in some images in ''[[The Beauty of Fractals]]'' by [[Heinz-Otto Peitgen]] and [[Michael M. Richter]]. They provide a formula to estimate the distance from a point outside the Mandelbrot set to the boundary of the Mandelbrot set (and a similar formula for the Julia sets). Landscapes can, for example, be formed from the distance function for a family of iterations of the form &lt;math&gt;z^{2} + az^{4} + c&lt;/math&gt;.

==Artists==
Notable fractal artists include [[Desmond Paul Henry]], [[Hamid Naderi Yeganeh]] and musician [[Bruno Degazio]].  The British artist [[William Latham (computer scientist)|William Latham]], has used fractal geometry and other computer graphics techniques in his works.&lt;ref name="fpc"&gt;{{cite book |title=Fractals: The Patterns of Chaos |last=Briggs |first=John |authorlink=John Briggs (author) |year=1992 |publisher=Thames and Hudson |location=London |isbn=0-500-27693-5 |page=169 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Greg Sams]] has used fractal designs in postcards, T-shirts and textiles. American [[Vicky Brago-Mitchell]] has created fractal art which has appeared in exhibitions and on magazine covers. [[Scott Draves]] is credited with inventing flame fractals. [[Carlos Ginzburg]] has explored fractal art and developed a concept called "homo fractalus" which is based around the idea that the human is the ultimate fractal.&lt;ref name="cagi"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://muse.jhu.edu/journals/leonardo/v034/34.1ginzburg.html |title=Carlos Ginzburg |year=2001 |work=[[Leonardo (journal)|Leonardo]] |publisher=[[Leonardo,_The_International_Society_of_the_Arts,_Sciences_and_Technology|Leonardo/ISAST]], the International Society for the Arts, Sciences and Technology |accessdate=29 October 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Merrin Parkers from New Zealand specialises in fractal art.&lt;ref name="hfn"&gt;{{cite book |title=Heaven's fractal net: retrieving lost visions in the humanities, Volume 1 |last=Jackson |first=William Joseph |year=2004 |publisher=Indiana University Press |isbn=0-253-21620-6 |page=116 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=U0rJz7FC2z8C |accessdate=30 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
[[Kerry Mitchell]] wrote a "Fractal Art Manifesto", claiming that&lt;ref name=manifesto&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.fractalus.com/info/manifesto.htm |title=The Fractal Art Manifesto |author=Mitchell, Kerry |authorlink=Kerry Mitchell |date= |accessdate=28 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|Fractal Art is a subclass of two-dimensional visual art, and is in many respects similar to photography—another art form that was greeted by skepticism upon its arrival. Fractal images typically are manifested as [[Printmaking|prints]], bringing fractal artists into the company of painters, photographers, and printmakers. Fractals exist natively as electronic images. This is a format that traditional visual artists are quickly embracing, bringing them into Fractal Art's digital realm. Generating fractals can be an artistic endeavor, a mathematical pursuit, or just a soothing diversion. However, Fractal Art is clearly distinguished from other digital activities by what it is, and by what it is not.&lt;ref name=manifesto/&gt;}}

According to Mitchell, fractal art is not computerized art, lacking in rules, unpredictable, nor something that any person with access to a computer can do well. Instead, fractal art is expressive, creative, and requires input, effort, and intelligence. Most importantly, "fractal art is simply that which is created by Fractal Artists: ART."&lt;ref name=manifesto/&gt;

More recently, American artist Hal Tenny was hired to design environment in [[Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2]].

In 1989, fractals were part of the subject matter for an art show called ''Strange Attractors: Signs of Chaos'' at the [[New Museum of Contemporary Art]].&lt;ref name="ciem"/&gt; The show consisted of photographs, installations and sculptures designed to provide greater scientific [[discourse]] to the field which had already captured the public's attention through colourful and intricate computer imagery.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2778">In [[abstract algebra]], the '''[[fundamental theorem]] on homomorphisms''', also known as the '''fundamental homomorphism theorem''', relates the structure of two objects between which a [[homomorphism]] is given, and of the [[Kernel (algebra)|kernel]] and image of the homomorphism.

The homomorphism theorem is used to prove the [[isomorphism theorem]]s.

== Group theoretic version ==

Given two [[group (mathematics)|group]]s ''G'' and ''H'' and a [[group homomorphism]] ''f'' : ''G''→''H'',  let ''K'' be a [[normal subgroup]] in ''G'' and φ the natural [[surjective]] homomorphism ''G''→''G''/''K'' (where ''G''/''K'' is a [[quotient group]]). If ''K'' is a subset of [[kernel (algebra)|ker]](''f'') then there exists a unique homomorphism ''h'':''G''/''K''→''H'' such that ''f'' = ''h'' φ.

In other words, the natural projection φ is [[Universal property|universal]] among homomorphisms on ''G'' that map ''K'' to the identity element.

The situation is described by the following [[commutative diagram]]:

[[File:Fundamental Homomorphism Theorem.svg]]

By setting ''K'' = ker(''f'') we immediately get the [[first isomorphism theorem]].

== Other versions ==
Similar theorems are valid for [[monoid]]s, [[vector space]]s, [[module (mathematics)|modules]], and [[ring (mathematics)|rings]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="63623">This is a glossary of properties and concepts in [[category theory]] in [[mathematics]].

*'''Notes on foundations''': In many expositions (e.g., Vistoli), the set-theoretic issues are ignored; this means, for instance, that one does not distinguish between small and large categories and that one can arbitrarily form a localization of a category.&lt;ref&gt;If one believes in the existence of [[strongly inaccessible cardinal]]s, then there can be a rigorous theory where statements and constructions have references to [[Grothendieck universe]]s.&lt;/ref&gt; Like those expositions, this glossary also generally ignores the set-theoretic issues, except when they are relevant (e.g., the discussion on accessibility.)

Especially for higher categories, the concepts from algebraic topology are also used in the category theory. For that see also [[glossary of algebraic topology]].

The notations and the conventions used throughout the article are:
*[''n''] = { 0, 1, 2, …, ''n'' }, which is viewed as a category (by writing &lt;math&gt;i \to j \Leftrightarrow i \le j&lt;/math&gt;.)
*'''Cat''', the [[category of categories|category of (small) categories]], where the objects are categories (which are small with respect to some universe) and the morphisms [[functor]]s.
*'''Fct'''(''C'', ''D''), the [[functor category]]: the category of [[functor]]s from a category ''C'' to a category ''D''.
*'''Set''', the category of (small) sets.
*''s'''''Set''', the category of [[simplicial set]]s.
*"weak" instead of "strict" is given the default status; e.g., "''n''-category" means "weak ''n''-category", not the strict one, by default.
*By an [[∞-category]], we mean a [[quasi-category]], the most popular model, unless other models are being discussed.
*The number [[zero]] 0 is a natural number.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="16265">There are a number of meanings for the term [[humanitarian]].  Here humanitarian pertains to the practice of saving lives and alleviating [[suffering]].  It is usually related to emergency response (also called humanitarian response) whether in the case of a natural disaster or a man-made disaster such as war or other armed conflict.  '''Humanitarian principles''' govern the way humanitarian response is carried out.

==Core humanitarian principles==

===Humanity===
The principle of humanity means that all humankind shall be treated humanely and equally in all circumstances by saving lives and alleviating suffering, while ensuring respect for the individual. It is the fundamental principle of humanitarian response.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.icrc.org/Web/eng/siteeng0.nsf/html/EA08067453343B76C1256D2600383BC4?OpenDocument&amp;Style=Custo_Final.3&amp;View=defaultBody3  Pictet (1979) Humanity]. [[Jean Pictet|Pictet's]] commentary is focused on the Red Cross use of the principle of humanity, but includes more general comments relevant to the whole humanitarian sector.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Humanitarian Imperative===
The [[Code of Conduct for the International Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement and NGOs in Disaster Relief]] (RC/NGO Code) introduces the concept of the humanitarian imperative which expands the principle of humanity to include the right to receive and to give humanitarian assistance.  It states the obligation of the international community "to provide humanitarian assistance wherever it is needed."&lt;ref&gt;For a critical view see: Hugo Slim, "Relief agencies and moral standing in war: principles of humanity, neutrality, impartiality and solidarity, Development in Practice, Volume 10, Numbers 3-4/August 1, 2000&lt;/ref&gt;

===Impartiality===
Provision of [[humanitarian assistance]] must be [[impartiality|impartial]] and not based on nationality, race, religion, or political point of view.  It must be based on need alone.

For most non-governmental humanitarian agencies (NGHAs), the principle of impartiality is unambiguous even if it is sometimes difficult to apply, especially in rapidly changing situations. However, it is no longer clear which organizations can claim to be humanitarian. For example, companies like PADCO, a USAID subcontractor, is sometimes seen as a humanitarian NGO.  However, for the UN agencies, particularly where the UN is involved in peace keeping activities as the result of a Security Council resolution, it is not clear if the UN is in position to act in an impartial manner if one of the parties is in violation of terms of the UN Charter.&lt;ref&gt;(See:  [[Report of the Panel on United Nations Peacekeeping]] (Brahimi report)pp. ix &amp; 9){{cite web|url=https://www.un.org/peace/reports/peace_operations/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=November 1, 2007 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071114055129/http://www.un.org/peace/reports/peace_operations/ |archivedate=November 14, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Independence===
Humanitarian agencies must formulate and implement their own policies independently of government policies or actions.

Problems may arise because most NGHAs rely in varying degrees on government donors.  Thus for some organizations it is difficult to maintain independence from their donors and not be confused in the field with governments who may be involved in the hostilities.  The [[International Committee of the Red Cross|ICRC]], has set the example for maintaining its independence (and neutrality) by raising its funds from governments  through the use of separate annual appeals for headquarters costs and field operations.&lt;ref&gt;(see: [http://www.redcross.int/EN/mag/magazine1996_3/18-19.html Joanna Macrae: NGOs: Has the 'N' gone missing?] [http://www.redcross.int/EN/mag/magazine1998_2/2-7.html Randolph Kent: Footing the aid bill])&lt;/ref&gt;

===Defining principles===
The core principles are defining characteristics, the necessary conditions for humanitarian response.  Organizations such as military forces and for-profit companies may deliver assistance to communities affected by disaster in order to save lives and alleviate suffering, but they are not considered by the humanitarian sector as humanitarian agencies as their response is not based on the core principles.

==Additional humanitarian principles==
In addition to the core principles, there are other principles that govern humanitarian response for specific types of humanitarian agencies such as UN agencies, the Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement, and NGOs.

===Neutrality===
The [[International Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement]] follows, in addition to the above core principles, the principle of neutrality.  For the Red Cross, neutrality means not to take sides in hostilities or engage at any time in controversies of a political, racial, religious or ideological nature.

The principle of neutrality was specifically addressed to the Red Cross Movement to prevent it from not only taking sides in a conflict, but not to "engage at any time in controversies of a political, racial, religious or ideological nature."  The principle of neutrality was left out of the Red Cross/NGO code because some of the NGHAs, while committed to giving impartial assistance, were not ready to forgo their lobbying on justice issues related to political and ideological questions.

United Nations General Assembly Resolution 46/182&lt;ref&gt;[http://daccessdds.un.org/doc/RESOLUTION/GEN/NR0/582/70/IMG/NR058270.pdf?OpenElement United Nations General Assembly Resolution 46/182]{{dead link|date=January 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; lists the principle of neutrality, alongside the principles of humanity and impartiality in its annex as a guide to the provision of humanitarian assistance.  The resolution is designed to strengthen human response of the UN system, and it clearly applies to the UN agencies.

[[neutrality (international relations)|Neutrality]] can also apply to humanitarian actions of a state.  "Neutrality remains closely linked with the definition which introduced the concept into international law to designate the status of a State which decided to stand apart from an armed conflict. Consequently, its applications under positive law still depend on the criteria of abstention and impartiality which have characterized neutrality from the outset."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.icrc.org/web/eng/siteeng0.nsf/html/57JN2Z|title=International Committee of the Red Cross|date=3 October 2013|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The application of the word neutrality to humanitarian aid delivered by UN agencies or even governments can be confusing.  GA Resolution 46/182 proclaims the principle of neutrality, yet as an inter-governmental political organization, the UN is often engaged in controversies of a political nature.  According to this interpretation, the UN agency or a government can provide neutral humanitarian aid as long as it does it impartially, based upon need alone.&lt;ref&gt;(For a discussion of the concept of neutrality with respect to humanitarian response see: [http://www.icrc.org/web/eng/siteeng0.nsf/html/57JN2Z Denise Plattner])&lt;/ref&gt;

Today, the word neutrality is widely used within the humanitarian community, usually to mean the provision of humanitarian aid in an impartial and independent manner, based on need alone.  Few international NGOs have curtailed work on justice or human rights issues because of their commitment to neutrality.

===Proselytism===
The provision of aid must not exploit the vulnerability of victims and be used to further political or religious creeds.  All of the major non-governmental humanitarian agencies (NGHAs) by signing up to the RC/NGO Code of Conduct have committed themselves not to use humanitarian response to further political or religious creeds.

==Principles based on field experience in emergencies==
All of the above principles are important requirements for  effective field operations.  They are based on widespread field experience of agencies engaged in humanitarian response.  In conflict situations, their breach may drastically affect the ability of agencies to respond to the needs of the victims.

If a warring party believes, for example, that an agency is favoring the other side, or that it is an agent of the enemy, access to the victims may be blocked and the lives of humanitarian workers may be put in danger.  If one of the parties perceives that an agency is trying to spread another religious faith, there may be a hostile reaction to their activities.

==Sources==
The core principles, found in the [[Red Cross/NGO Code of Conduct]] and in GA Resolution 46/182&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.un.org/Docs/journal/asp/ws.asp?m=A/RES/46/182|title=A/RES/46/182 - E|website=www.un.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; are derived from the Fundamental Principles of the Red Cross, particularly principles I (humanity), II (impartiality), III (neutrality—in the case of the UN), and IV (independence).&lt;ref&gt;(For a discussion of their background and a commentary on the principles see: [http://www.icrc.org/web/eng/siteeng0.nsf/htmlall/5mje9n Jean Pictet 1979])&lt;/ref&gt;

== Humanitarian accountability ==
Accountability has been defined as: "the processes through which an organisation makes a 
commitment to respond to and balance the needs of stakeholders in its decision making processes and activities, and delivers against this commitment."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author1=Lloyd, Robert M. |author2=Monica Blagescu |author3=Lucy de las Casas |title=Pathways to Accountability: The Gap Framework |publisher=One World Trust |location= |year=2005 |pages= 5|isbn=0-9504434-6-8 |oclc= |doi= |accessdate=|url=dtrust.org/documents/Pathways_to_Accountability,_A_Short_Guide_to_the_GAP_Framework.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Humanitarian Accountability Partnership International]] adds: "Accountability is about using power responsibly."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hapinternational.org/other/faq.aspx#top|title=HAPI|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Article 9 of the [[Code of Conduct for the International Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement and NGOs in Disaster Relief]] states:
"We hold ourselves accountable to both those we seek to assist and those from whom we accept resources;" and thus identifies the two major stake holders: donors and beneficiaries.  However, traditionally humanitarian agencies have tended to practice mainly "upward accountability", i.e. to their donors.&lt;ref&gt;Mary Anderson: {{cite web |url=http://programs.ssrc.org/emergencies/publications/Anderson.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2008-07-18 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081201180533/http://programs.ssrc.org/emergencies/publications/Anderson.pdf |archivedate=2008-12-01 |df= }} p.2&lt;/ref&gt;

The experience of many humanitarian agencies during the Rwandan Genocide, led to a number of initiatives designed to improve humanitarian assistance and accountability, particularly with respect to the beneficiaries.  Examples include the [[Sphere Project]], [[ALNAP]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.alnap.org/|title=ALNAP - Home|website=www.alnap.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; Compas,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101103064539/http://www.compasqualite.org/en/index/index.php|title=Quality COMPAS - Homepage|date=3 November 2010|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  the [[People In Aid]] Code of Good Practice,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.peopleinaid.org/code/|title=Home Page|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Humanitarian Accountability Partnership International]], which runs a "global quality insurance scheme for humanitarian agencies."

==Additional principles==
The RC/NGO Code also lists a number of more aspirational principles which are derived from experience  with development assistance.
*Agencies should operate with respect to culture and custom
*Humanitarian response should use local resources and capacities as much as possible
*The participation of the beneficiaries should be encouraged
*Emergency response should strive to reduce future vulnerabilities
*Agencies should be accountable to both donors and beneficiaries
*Humanitarian agencies should use information activities to portray victims as dignified human beings, not hopeless objects

==The right to life with dignity==
The Sphere Project Humanitarian Charter&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sphereproject.org/content/view/27/84/lang,English/ Sphere Handbook] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061229181547/http://www.sphereproject.org/content/view/27/84/lang,English/ |date=2006-12-29 }}&lt;/ref&gt; uses the language of human rights to remind that the [[right to life]] which is proclaimed in both the [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]] and the [[International Convention on Civil and Political Rights]] is related to [[human dignity]].

==Vulnerability and behavioral issues==
Humanitarian principles are mainly focused on the behavior of organizations.  However a humane response implies that humanitarian workers are not to take advantage of the [[social vulnerability|vulnerabilities]] of those affected by war and violence.  Agencies have the responsibility for developing rules of staff conduct which prevent abuse of the beneficiaries.

===Sexual exploitation and abuse===
One of the most problematic areas is related to the issue of [[Sexual exploitation and abuse in humanitarian response|sexual exploitation and abuse]] of beneficiaries by humanitarian workers.  In an emergency where victims have lost everything, women and girls are particularly vulnerable to sexual abuse.

A number of reports which identified the sexual exploitation of refugees in west Africa prodded the humanitarian community to work together in examining the problem and to take measures to prevent abuses.  In July 2002, the UN's Interagency Standing Committee (IASC) adopted a plan of action which stated: Sexual exploitation and abuse by humanitarian workers constitute acts of gross misconduct and are therefore grounds for termination of employment.  The plan explicitly prohibited the "Exchange of money, employment, goods, or services for sex, including sexual favours or other forms of humiliating, degrading or exploitative behaviour."  The major NGHAs as well the UN agencies engaged in humanitarian response committed themselves to setting up internal structures to prevent sexual exploitation and abuse of beneficiaries.&lt;ref&gt;(See:[http://ochaonline.un.org/webpage.asp?Site=sexex IASC, Protection from Sexual Exploitation and Abuse] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061120184234/http://ochaonline.un.org/webpage.asp?Site=sexex |date=2006-11-20 }})&lt;/ref&gt;

==Compliance==
Substantial efforts have been made in the humanitarian sector to monitor compliance with humanitarian principles. Such efforts include The [[People In Aid#The People In Aid Code of Good Practice|People In Aid Code of Good Practice]], an internationally recognised management tool that helps humanitarian and development organisations enhance the quality of their human resources management. The NGO, [[Humanitarian Accountability Partnership International]], is also working to make humanitarian organizations more accountable, especially to the beneficiaries.

Structures internal to the Red Cross Movement monitor compliance to the Fundamental Principles of the Red Cross.

The RC/NGO Code is self-enforcing. The [[SCHR]] carries out peer reviews among its members which look in part at the issue of compliance with principles set out in the RC/NGO Code

'''Ida Pauline Rolf''' (May 19, 1896 – March 19, 1979&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rolfguild.org/about/ida-p-rolf-phd|title=Guild for Structural Integration: Ida P. Rolf, Ph.D. - Ida P. Rolf Method training and information|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;) was a biochemist and the creator of [[Structural Integration]] or "[[Rolfing]]".

==Early life and education==
Rolf was born in [[New York City]] in the [[Bronx]] on May 19, 1896. An only child, her father, Bernard Rolf, was a civil engineer who built docks and piers on the east coast.

Rolf graduated from [[Barnard College]] in 1916 with a bachelor's degree. She was in the Mathematics Club, German Club, Vice President of the class of 1916, a member of the Young Women's Christian Assn., was the alternate for the Graduate Fellowship while working at the Rockefeller Foundation, Business Manager of The Barnard Bulletin, and a member of [[Phi Beta Kappa]]. She received Departmental Honours in Chemistry at graduation. In 1917 she began her doctoral studies at [[Columbia University]] and, concurrently, Rolf also began work at the [[Rockefeller University|Rockefeller Institute]] as a chemical research worker. She was invited back to Barnard College in 1918 to speak to students about "work experiences".

In 1920, Rolf earned her PhD in [[biochemistry|biological chemistry]] under the supervision of [[Phoebus Aaron Theodore Levene]], of Columbia University's College of Physicians and Surgeons. Her dissertation was entitled; "Three Contributions to the Chemistry of the Unsaturated Phosphatides", originally printed in three separate issues of "The Journal of Biological Chemistry", it was again printed in its entirety as a bound book in late 1922,  "[[Phosphatidate|Phosphatides]]".

Throughout the decade, she was studying yoga and tantra with [[Pierre Bernard (yogi)|Pierre Bernard]].

==Career==
After graduating, Rolf continued to work with Levene at the Rockefeller Institute for Medical Research in New York City. In 1918 she was promoted to assistant in the chemistry lab.

In 1922, two years after having received her PhD from Columbia, Rolf was raised to associate, then the highest non-tenured position for a scientist at Rockefeller.&lt;ref name=Johnson&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Johnson|first1=Sam|title=Ida Rolf and the Two Paradigms|journal=International Association of Structural Integrators (IASI) Yearbook|date=2007|url=http://www.samjohnsonrolfing.com/reading/ida-rolf-and-the-two-paradigms/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From 1919 to 1927 she published 16 scholarly journal papers, mostly in the ''[[Journal of Biological Chemistry]]''. Her research was primarily laboratory studies on biochemical compounds [[lecithin]] and [[phosphatidylethanolamine|cephalin]]. With the exception of her doctoral dissertation, all of her published work was co-authored with Levene.&lt;ref name=Johnson/&gt;

In 1926, Rolf left her academic work in New York, to study mathematics and atomic physics at the [[ETH Zurich|Swiss Federal Institute of Technology]] in Zurich and also biochemistry at the [[Pasteur Institute]] in France.&lt;ref name=Johnson/&gt;

Rolf later developed [[Structural Integration]]. In addition to her 16 academic papers published from 1919 to 1927, she would later publish two papers in scholarly journals on structural integration. She had an [[h-index]] of 10 with a total number of 299 [[citation]]s (February, 2007).

==Structural Integration (Rolfing)==
{{main|Rolfing}}
Structural Integration (or Rolfing) is a type of [[manual therapy]] that aims to improve human biomechanical functioning as a whole rather than to treat particular symptoms.&lt;ref&gt;Jacobson, Eric: ''The Journal of alternative and complementary medicine''. Volume 17, Number 9, 2011, p.775.&lt;/ref&gt; Rolf began developing her system in the 1940s. Her main goal was to organize the human bodily structure in relation to [[gravity]]. Rolf called her method "[[Structural Integration]]", now also commonly known by the trademark "[[Rolfing]]".&lt;ref name= "Salvo"&gt;{{cite book |last1= Salvo |first1= Susan G. |year= 2012 |title= Massage Therapy: Principles and Practice |publisher= Elsevier Saunders |page= 423] |edition= 4 |isbn= 1437719775 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Structural integration is a pseudoscience and its claimed benefits are not substantiated by medical evidence.&lt;ref name=pop&gt;{{cite book |author=Cordón, LA |work=Popular Psychology: An Encyclopedia |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Uy1gmwcAgg4C&amp;pg=PA218 |date=January 2005 |publisher=Greenwood Publishing Group |isbn=978-0-313-32457-4 |pages=217–218 |title=Rolfing }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=aus17&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.health.gov.au/internet/main/publishing.nsf/content/0E9129B3574FCA53CA257BF0001ACD11/$File/Natural%20Therapies%20Overview%20Report%20Final%20with%20copyright%2011%20March.pdf |publisher=Australian Government &amp;ndash; Department of Health |format=PDF |author=Baggoley C |title=Review of the Australian Government Rebate on Natural Therapies for Private Health Insurance |year=2015 |laysummary=https://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/australian-review-finds-no-benefit-to-17-natural-therapies |lay-source=Gavura, S. Australian review finds no benefit to 17 natural therapies. Science-Based Medicine. |lay-date=19 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Rolf's second son, Richard, helped her to continue developing and refining Structural Integration, as well as assisting in preliminary studies of the healing effects of structural integration. They taught Structural Integration classes at locations around the United States from the 1960s thru the late 1970s. Auditor and practitioner classes were taught in California, Florida, and Glassboro NJ. Based for many years in New York City where they shared office and work space, they worked together to advance the practice and to make the general public aware of the practice and benefits of Structural Integration.&lt;ref name="Demmerle"&gt;Demmerle, Richard, DC (Dec 2007). [http://www.somatics.de/DemmerleR_memories.pdf "Memories of an Exceptional Pioneer"]. ''Structural Integration''.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the mid-1960s she began teaching at [[Esalen Institute]], where she created a loyal following of students and practitioners.&lt;ref name=Stillerman&gt;{{cite book |last= Stillerman |first= Elaine |year= 2009 |title= Modalities for Massage and Bodywork |publisher= [[Mosby (publisher)|Mosby]] |pages= 152, 157, 329–345 |isbn= 032305255X}}&lt;/ref&gt; Esalen was the epicenter of the [[Human Potential Movement]], allowing Rolf to exchange ideas with many contemporary visionaries, including [[Fritz Perls]].&lt;ref name=Claire&gt;{{cite book |last= Claire |first= Thomas |year= 1995 |title= Bodywork: What Type of Massage to Get and How to Make the Most of It |publisher= [[William Morrow and Co.]] |pages= 40–56 |isbn= 9781591202325}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Perls|first1=Frederick|title=In and Out of the Garbage Pail|date=1969|publisher=Real People Press|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Ux4pAQAAMAAJ&amp;focus=searchwithinvolume&amp;q=Esalen}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1971, Rolf´s teaching activities were consolidated under the Rolf Institute of Structural Integration (RISI).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://kepler.sos.ca.gov |title= Business Search (search for 'Rolf Institute') |publisher= Secretary of State, CA}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="zenpioneer"&gt;Stirling, Isabel. ''Zen Pioneer: The Life &amp; Works of Ruth Fuller Sasaki'' (2006) Shoemaker &amp; Hoard. {{ISBN|978-1-59376-110-3}} p. 8.&lt;/ref&gt; The school has been based in Boulder, Colorado since 1972. As of 2010, the RISI had graduated 1536 practitioners, including some trained in Germany, Brazil, Japan and Australia. In 1990, a group of senior RISI faculty split to found the Guild of Structural Integration, which had 628 graduates as of 2010. Currently there are nearly two dozen schools teaching Structural Integration.&lt;ref name="Jacobson, Eric 2011, p. 778"&gt;Jacobson, Eric: ''The Journal of alternative and complementary medicine''. Volume 17, Number 9, 2011, p. 778.&lt;/ref&gt; Standards are maintained by a professional membership organization, the International Association of Structural Integration.&lt;ref name = Myers/&gt;

In addition to the proliferation of practitioners and training institutes that are devoted specifically to Structural Integration, Rolf's concepts and methods have influenced a wide range of other contemporary manual therapies. A growing number of organizations offer training in "structural bodywork" or in techniques of fascial manipulation that are clearly derivative but lack the holistic perspective of Structural Integration, instead focusing only on the treatment of specific symptoms (i.e. massage therapists, chiropractors or physical therapists).&lt;ref name="Jacobson, Eric 2011, p. 778"/&gt;&lt;ref name = Myers&gt;Myers, Tom: ''Structural Integration. Developments in Ida Rolf´s recipe''. I. J Bodywork Movement Ther 2004, pp. 131-142.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Research foundation==
In 2007, the Ida P. Rolf Fascia Research Foundation was formed to encourage and support evidence-based studies of Structural Integration's effects and its implications for conventional and complementary health care. It was introduced at the First International Fascia Research Congress (FRC) at the Harvard Medical Center. The foundation is dedicated to growing a symbiotic relationship between science and therapeutic practice.  These events bring scientists and clinicians together to share their ideas and encourage collaboration.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://rolfresearchfoundation.org|title=Ida P. Rolf Research Foundation - Charting the Science of Structural Integration|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fasciacongress.org|title=Fourth International Fascia Research Congress, Washington, D.C., September 18-20, 2015|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Fascia Research Congress occurred again in 2009 in Amsterdam, 2012 in Vancouver, BC, and in 2015 in Virginia, US.

==Personal life==
Ida Rolf was married to Walter Frederick Demmerle, an electrical and mechanical engineer who held patents for heating thermostats, and traveled abroad frequently with his work. They resided in [[Stony Brook, New York]], and [[Manhasset]], NY while raising a family. They had two sons, Alan Michael Demmerle and Richard Rolf Demmerle. Richard was a chiropractor and also a Rolfing instructor and practitioner who was involved in, and helped refine and develop his mother's Rolfing project and continued her work after Ida's death. 
Richard has three sons, Rolf Walter, Jean-Pierre, and Michael Richard. Richard moved to Switzerland in 1979 with Brigitte Waldmeier Demmerle, his wife, and their youngest son Michael Richard Demmerle.  Rolf Walter resides in the US and is a custom builder, owner of "Demmerle Builders Inc." Jean-Pierre resides in Switzerland semi retired doing computer graphic design. Michael Richard still resides in  Switzerland and  owns a company doing media development, production and distribution.  Richard Rolf Demmerle died February 1, 2015.{{citation needed|date=March 2016}} Brigitte Waldmeier Demmerle passed in 2017.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="39965">'''Immersion''' into [[virtual reality]] is a perception of being physically [[Presence (telepresence)|present]] in a non-physical world. The perception is created by surrounding the user of the VR system in images, sound or other [[Stimulation|stimuli]] that provide an engrossing total environment.

The name is a metaphoric use of the experience of [[wikt:submerge|submersion]] applied to representation, fiction or simulation. Immersion can also be defined as the state of consciousness where a "visitor" ([[Maurice Benayoun]]) or "immersant" ([[Char Davies]])'s awareness of physical self is transformed by being surrounded in an artificial environment; used for describing partial or complete [[suspension of disbelief]], enabling action or reaction to stimulations encountered in a virtual or artistic environment. The degree to which the virtual or artistic environment faithfully reproduces reality determines the degree of suspension of disbelief. The greater the suspension of disbelief, the greater the degree of presence achieved.

[[File:Head-mounted display and wired gloves, Ames Research Center.jpg|right|thumb|Classic [[Virtual reality]] HMD]]
According to [[Ernest W. Adams]], author and consultant on [[game design]],&lt;ref name=ernest&gt;{{cite web | last =Adams | first =Ernest | title =Postmodernism and the Three Types of Immersion | publisher =[[Gamasutra]] | date =July 9, 2004 | url =http://designersnotebook.com/Columns/063_Postmodernism/063_postmodernism.htm | accessdate =2007-12-26 | deadurl =no | archiveurl =https://web.archive.org/web/20071024225651/http://www.designersnotebook.com/Columns/063_Postmodernism/063_postmodernism.htm | archivedate =October 24, 2007 | df = }}&lt;/ref&gt; immersion can be separated into three main categories:

;Tactical immersion
:Tactical immersion is experienced when performing tactile operations that involve skill. Players feel "in the zone" while perfecting actions that result in success.

;Strategic immersion
:Strategic immersion is more cerebral, and is associated with mental challenge. Chess players experience strategic immersion when choosing a correct solution among a broad array of possibilities.

;Narrative immersion
:Narrative immersion occurs when players become invested in a story, and is similar to what is experienced while reading a book or watching a movie.

Staffan Björk and Jussi Holopainen, in ''Patterns In Game Design'',&lt;ref name=bjork&gt;{{cite book | last =Björk | first =Staffan |author2=Jussi Holopainen | title =Patterns In Game Design | publisher =Charles River Media | year =2004 | page =206 | url = {{Google books |plainurl=yes |id=IFQfyODK4wAC }} | isbn =1-58450-354-8 }}&lt;/ref&gt; divide immersion into similar categories, but call them '''sensory-motoric immersion''', '''cognitive immersion''' and '''emotional immersion''', respectively. In addition to these, they add a new category:

;Spatial immersion
:Spatial immersion occurs when a player feels the simulated world is perceptually convincing. The player feels that he or she is really "there" and that a simulated world looks and feels "real".

Presence, a term derived from the shortening of the original "[[telepresence]]", is a phenomenon enabling people to interact with and feel connected to the world outside their physical bodies via technology. It is defined as a person's '''subjective sensation''' of being there in a scene depicted by a medium, usually virtual in nature.&lt;ref name=barfield&gt;{{cite book | last=Barfield | first=Woodrow | last2=Zeltzer | first2=David | last3=Sheridan | first3=Thomas | last4=Slater | first4=Mel | editor1-last=Barfield | editor1-first=Woodrow | editor2-last = Furness, III | editor2-first=Thomas A. | title=Virtual Environments and Advanced Interface Design | chapter=Presence and Performance Within Virtual Environments | publisher = Oxford University Press | year=1995 | page=473 | url = {{Google books |plainurl=yes |id=OLE-4j3tHi0C}} | isbn=0195075552}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most designers focus on the technology used to create a high-fidelity virtual environment; however, the human factors involved in achieving a state of presence must be taken into account as well. It is the subjective perception, although generated by and/or filtered through human-made technology, that ultimately determines the successful attainment of presence.&lt;ref name=Thornson&gt;{{cite journal | last1=Thornson | first1=Carol | last2=Goldiez |first2=Brian | date=January 2009 | title=Predicting presence: Constructing the Tendency toward Presence Inventory | url=https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijhcs.2008.08.006 |journal=International Journal of Human Computer Studies | volume=67 | issue=1 | pages=62-78 | doi=10.1016/j.ijhcs.2008.08.006 | access-date= 19 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Virtual reality glasses can produce a visceral feeling of being in a simulated world, a form of spatial immersion called Presence. According to [[Oculus VR]], the technology requirements to achieve this visceral reaction are low-latency and precise tracking of movements.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cnet.com/news/oculus-rift-dev-kit-2-now-on-sale-for-350/|title=Oculus Rift Dev Kit 2 now on sale for $350|author=Seth Rosenblatt|date=19 March 2014|publisher=CBS Interactive|work=CNET|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140328041627/http://www.cnet.com/news/oculus-rift-dev-kit-2-now-on-sale-for-350/|archivedate=28 March 2014|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.slashgear.com/oculus-rift-dk2-hands-on-and-first-impressions-19321282/|title=Oculus Rift DK2 hands-on and first-impressions|work=SlashGear}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oculusvr.com/blog/announcing-the-oculus-rift-development-kit-2-dk2/|title=Announcing the Oculus Rift Development Kit 2 (DK2)|author=|date=|website=oculusvr.com|accessdate=3 May 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140913045405/http://www.oculusvr.com/blog/announcing-the-oculus-rift-development-kit-2-dk2/|archivedate=13 September 2014|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* A wide field of view (80 degrees or better)
* Adequate resolution (1080p or better)
* Low pixel persistence (3 ms or less)
* A high enough refresh rate (&gt;60&amp;nbsp;Hz, 95&amp;nbsp;Hz is enough but less may be adequate)
* Global display where all pixels are illuminated simultaneously (rolling display may work with eye tracking.)
* Optics (at most two lenses per eye with trade-offs, ideal optics not practical using current technology)
* Optical calibration
* Rock-solid tracking – translation with millimeter accuracy or better, orientation with quarter degree accuracy or better, and volume of 1.5 meter or more on a side
* Low latency (20 ms motion to last photon, 25 ms may be good enough)

== Immersive virtual reality ==
[[File:CAVE Crayoland.jpg|thumb|The [[Cave Automatic Virtual Environment]]]]
'''Immersive virtual reality''' is a hypothetical future technology that exists today as [[virtual reality]] art projects, for the most part.&lt;ref&gt;[[Joseph Nechvatal]], ''Immersive Ideals / Critical Distances''. [[LAP Lambert Academic Publishing]]. 2009, pp. 367-368&lt;/ref&gt; It consists of immersion in an [[Simulation|artificial]] environment where the user feels just as immersed as they usually feel in [[consensus reality]].

=== Direct interaction of the nervous system ===
The most considered method would be to induce the sensations that made up the [[virtual reality]] in the [[nervous system]] directly. In [[functionalism (philosophy of mind)|functionalism]]/conventional [[biology]] we interact with [[consensus reality]] through the [[nervous system]]. Thus we receive all input from all the senses as nerve impulses.
It gives your neurons a feeling of heightened sensation. It would involve the user receiving inputs as artificially stimulated [[nerve]] impulses, the system would receive the CNS outputs (natural nerve impulses) and process them allowing the user to interact with the [[virtual reality]]. Natural impulses between the body and [[central nervous system]] would need to be prevented. This could be done by blocking out natural impulses using nanorobots which attach themselves to the brain wiring, whilst receiving the digital impulses of which describe the virtual world, which could then be sent into the wiring of the brain. A [[feedback]] system between the user and the computer which stores the information would also be needed. Considering how much information would be required for such a system, it is likely that it would be based on hypothetical forms of computer technology.

=== Requirements ===
;Understanding of the nervous system
A comprehensive understanding of which nerve impulses correspond to which sensations, and which motor impulses correspond to which muscle contractions will be required. This will allow the correct sensations in the user, and actions in the virtual reality to occur. The [[Blue Brain Project]] is the current, most promising research with the idea of understanding how the brain works by building very large scale computer models.

;Ability to manipulate [[Central nervous system|CNS]]
The [[nervous system]] would obviously need to be manipulated. Whilst non-invasive devices using radiation have been postulated, invasive cybernetic implants are likely to become available sooner and be more accurate.{{Citation needed|date=July 2018}} Manipulation could occur at any stage of the nervous system – the spinal cord is likely to be simplest; as all nerves pass through here, this could be the only site of manipulation.{{Citation needed|date=July 2018}}
[[Molecular nanotechnology]] is likely to provide the degree of precision required and could allow the implant to be built inside the body rather than be inserted by an operation.{{Citation needed|date=July 2018}}

;Computer hardware/software to process inputs/outputs
A very powerful computer would be necessary for processing virtual reality complex enough to be nearly indistinguishable from consensus reality and interacting with central nervous system fast enough.

== Immersive digital environments ==

[[File:COSMOPOLIS.jpg|right|thumb|Cosmopolis (2005), [[Maurice Benayoun]]'s Giant Virtual Reality Interactive Installation]]
An '''immersive digital environment''' is an [[Simulation|artificial]], [[interactive]], computer-created [[cut scene|scene]] or "world" within which a user can immerse themselves.&lt;ref&gt;[[Joseph Nechvatal]], ''Immersive Ideals / Critical Distances''. [[LAP Lambert Academic Publishing]]. 2009, pp. 48-60&lt;/ref&gt;

Immersive digital environments could be thought of as synonymous with [[virtual reality]], but without the implication that actual "reality" is being simulated. An immersive digital environment could be a model of [[reality]], but it could also be a complete fantasy [[user interface]] or [[abstraction]], as long as the user of the environment is immersed within it. The definition of immersion is wide and variable, but here it is assumed to mean simply that the user feels like they are part of the simulated "[[universe]]". The success with which an immersive digital environment can actually immerse the [[User (computing)|user]] is dependent on many factors such as believable [[3D computer graphics]], [[surround sound]], interactive user-input and other factors such as simplicity, functionality and potential for enjoyment. New technologies are currently under development which claim to bring realistic environmental effects to the players' environment – effects like wind, seat vibration and ambient lighting.

=== Perception ===
To create a sense of full immersion, the 5 senses (sight, sound, touch, smell, taste) must perceive the digital environment to be physically real.  [[Immersive technology]] can perceptually fool the senses through:
* Panoramic 3D displays (visual)
* Surround sound acoustics (auditory)
* Haptics and force feedback (tactile)
* Smell replication (olfactory)
* Taste replication (gustation)

=== Interaction ===
Once the senses reach a sufficient belief that the digital environment is real (it is interaction and involvement which can never be real), the user must then be able to interact with the environment in a natural, intuitive manner.  Various [[immersive technologies]] such as gestural controls, motion tracking, and computer vision respond to the user's actions and movements.  Brain control interfaces (BCI) respond to the user's brainwave activity.

=== Examples and applications ===
Training and rehearsal simulations run the gamut from part task procedural training (often buttonology, for example:  which button do you push to deploy a refueling boom) through situational simulation (such as crisis response or convoy driver training) to full motion simulations which train pilots or soldiers and law enforcement in scenarios that are too dangerous to train in actual equipment using live ordinance.

[[Computer games]] from simple arcade to [[massively multiplayer online game]] and training programs such as [[Flight simulator|flight]] and [[Driving simulator|driving]] simulators. Entertainment environments such as motion simulators that immerse the riders/players in a virtual digital environment enhanced by motion, visual and aural cues. Reality simulators, such as one of the [[Virunga Mountains]] in [[Rwanda]] that takes you on a trip through the jungle to meet a tribe of [[mountain gorilla]]s.&lt;ref&gt;[http://pulseworks.com/Film_Library.html pulseworks.com] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090505131611/http://pulseworks.com/Film_Library.html |date=2009-05-05 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Or training versions such as one which simulates taking a ride through human arteries and the [[heart]] to witness the buildup of [[Atheromatous plaque|plaque]] and thus learn about [[cholesterol]] and health.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.usagainstathero.com/arteryexplorer/index.aspx|title=Thank You|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In parallel with scientist, artists like [[Knowbotic Research]], [[Donna Cox]], [[Rebecca Allen (artist)|Rebecca Allen]], [[Robbie Cooper]], [[Maurice Benayoun]],
[[Char Davies]], and [[Jeffrey Shaw]] use the potential of immersive virtual reality to create physiologic or symbolic experiences and situations.

Other examples of immersion technology include physical environment / immersive space with surrounding digital projections and sound such as the [[Cave Automatic Virtual Environment|CAVE]], and the use of [[virtual reality headset]]s for viewing movies, with head-tracking and computer control of the image presented, so that the viewer appears to be inside the scene. The next generation is VIRTSIM, which achieves total immersion through motion capture and wireless head mounted displays for teams of up to thirteen immersants enabling natural movement through space and interaction in both the virtual and physical space simultaneously.

==== Use in medical care ====

== Detrimental effects ==

[[Simulation sickness]], or simulator sickness, is a condition where a person exhibits symptoms similar to motion sickness caused by playing computer/simulation/video games (Oculus Rift is working to solve simulator sickness).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=|url=http://www.polygon.com/2013/8/19/4636508/oculus-rift-is-working-to-solve-simulator-sickness|title=Oculus Rift is working to solve simulator sickness|publisher=Polygon|date=|accessdate=2015-05-05|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150924142134/http://www.polygon.com/2013/8/19/4636508/oculus-rift-is-working-to-solve-simulator-sickness|archivedate=2015-09-24|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Motion sickness]] due to virtual reality is very similar to simulation sickness and motion sickness due to films. In virtual reality, however, the effect is made more acute as all external reference points are blocked from vision, the simulated images are three-dimensional and in some cases stereo sound that may also give a sense of motion. Studies have shown that exposure to rotational motions in a virtual environment can cause significant increases in nausea and other symptoms of motion sickness.&lt;ref&gt;So, R.H.Y. and Lo, W.T. (1999) "Cybersickness: An Experimental Study to Isolate the Effects of Rotational Scene Oscillations." Proceedings of IEEE Virtual Reality '99 Conference, March 13–17, 1999, Houston, Texas. Published by IEEE Computer Society, pp.&amp;nbsp;237–241&lt;/ref&gt;

Other behavioural changes such as stress, [[Virtual Reality Addiction|addiction]], isolation and mood changes are also discussed to be side-effects caused by immersive virtual reality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.agocg.ac.uk/reports/virtual/37/37.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-11-25 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141218043150/http://www.agocg.ac.uk/reports/virtual/37/37.pdf |archivedate=2014-12-18 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="25858">The '''legal system of the [[United Arab Emirates]]''' is based on the [[Constitution of the United Arab Emirates|Constitution]] of the United Arab Emirates; this system is dual in nature as it has local and federal courts with a Supreme Court Based at Abu Dhabi.&lt;ref&gt;http://globalarbitrationreview.com/know-how/topics/73/jurisdictions/33/united-arab-emirates/&lt;/ref&gt;

Unlike Britain&lt;ref&gt;https://www.innertemple.org.uk/downloads/education/lectures/lecture_james_lee.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; and other countries where previous court judgments are regularly used as legal precedents, the UAE does not depend that much on precedents, although sometimes the judgments of higher courts can be applied by lower courts in similar cases.

Where legislative provisions do not cover a specific issue, the court will make a decision in accordance with Sharia law. Islamic jurisprudence is widely used in the construction and interpretation of the UAE law.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.hadefpartners.com/News/115/SHARIA-AS-A-SOURCE-OF-UAE-LAW|title=Sharia as a source of UAE law|last=|first=|date=|website=www.hadefpartners.com|publisher=|access-date=2016-11-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
Prior to the Union in 1971, the Trucial States were known as a protectorate of the British Empire established through a number of treaties. During that period, most disputes were handled by the rulers of the emirates, heads of local tribes, and unofficial judges following [[customary law]]. The primary source of law was Islam along with the unwritten social conventions or "[[Urf]]". Sharia judges specialized in family disputes whereas customary law judges handled criminal assaults and personal disputes. In the inland Bedouin communities, disputes usually related to livestock and water resources. Disputes in coastal cities were normally about trade and commercial relations, particularly related to the pearl trade.

After the 1853 truce, disputes pertaining to pearl diving were handled directly by the British [[Persian Gulf Residency|political resident]] in the [[Persian Gulf]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Judicial System in The Trucial Coast|last=Al Falahi|first=Noora|publisher=Hamdan Bin Mohammed Heritage Centre|year=2014|isbn=|location=|pages=27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==UAE legal system in the constitution==

The United Arab Emirates’ [[Constitution of the United Arab Emirates|Constitution]], which came into effect on 2 December 1971, dedicates all its fifth Section for the Union legal system. Article 94 of the Constitution stipulates that “justice is the basis of authority”.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.constituteproject.org/constitution/United_Arab_Emirates_2004.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

== Sources of UAE laws ==
The United Arab Emirates is essentially a civil law jurisdiction that depends in the first place on Roman, French, Egyptian laws . However, the main source of the Emirati law is the [[Sharia|Sharia law]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; International law is another source of Emirati law, in compliance with the UAE obligations signed in international conventions.

== Courts ==

===The Supreme Court===

Being the highest judicial instance in the UAE does not mean that it applies to the seven Emirates, Dubai and Ras Al Khayma have their own local judicial system. Article 96 of the UAE Constitution reads as follows “The Supreme Court of the Union shall consist of a President and a number of Judges, not exceeding five in all, who shall be appointed by decree, issued by the President of the Union after approval by the Supreme Council ”.

The constitution also divides courts in the country into two types, federal courts and local courts. The president and the members of the Supreme Court can by no means be removed from their offices, except in the following cases: Death, resignation, completion of term or secondment, retirement, permanent disability that prevent a judge from undertaking their duties, disciplinary discharge and finally “appointment to other offices, with their agreement”. Any court has it jurisdiction, the judgments of the Emirati Supreme Court cover matters like Miscellaneous disputes raising between the Member Emirates, law constitutionality, constitution interpretation, interrogation of senior officials of the Union like Ministers, crimes threatening affecting the interests of the Union. Article 101 of the Emirati Constitution stipulates that “The judgements of the Supreme Court of the Union shall be final and binding upon all.”

The first President of the Union Supreme Court of the United Arab Emirates is H.E Judge Dr. Abdul Wahab Abdul (incumbent).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ejustice.gov.ae/portal/page/portal/eJustice%20MOJ%20Portal/SupremeCourt/Home|website=Union Supreme Court|accessdate=13 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Federal Courts===

As their names suggests, Federal Courts are competent to consider all cases arising within the UAE territory, like disputes, domiciliary, transactions, etc. "Furthermore, UAE courts have a kind of “emergency jurisdiction,” whereby a UAE court can determine preliminary applications for attachment of a defendant’s assets as well as urgent applications, even where the court would otherwise lack jurisdiction" . Cases are commenced in Federal Courts when the complaint is filed with the Reconciliation and Settlement Committee. “The relevant reconciliation committee will attempt reconciliation, and refer complaints to the court only after resolution efforts have failed.”&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.attorneys.ae/news/uae-courts/|title=How the Federal and local court systems fit together, UAE Courts|newspaper=UAE Attorneys|language=en-US|access-date=2016-11-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Local Courts===

Local courts (First Instance Court) in the UAE basically consider “cases, authentications and all urgent matters related to disputes among the people as well as the safeguard of their rights, security and safety. It also undertakes forcible judicial execution for execution deed stipulated by law, as well as executions by deputation or reference”.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.dubaicourts.gov.ae/portal/page?_pageid=292,447242&amp;_dad=portal&amp;_schema=PORTAL|title=First Instance Court|last=|first=|date=|website=www.dubaicourts.gov.ae|publisher=|access-date=2016-11-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sharia Courts

Sharia courts focus on civil disputes in which the parties are Muslims. They depend on the juristic provisions provided for in the Quran the Hadith to render decisions. “The Sharia court may, at the federal level only (which, as mentioned earlier, excludes Dubai and Ras Al Khaimah), also hear appeals of certain criminal cases including rape, robbery, driving under the influence of alcohol and related crimes, which were originally tried in lower criminal courts."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://dubai.usconsulate.gov/emergency_uae_court.html|title=The UAE Court System|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=Dubai, UAE - Consulate General of the United States|access-date=2016-11-01|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151022020506/http://dubai.usconsulate.gov/emergency_uae_court.html|archivedate=2015-10-22|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Civil Courts

The jurisdiction of civil courts is generic as they can consider urgent cases and petitions of all types, including petitions of attachments, orders of payment and complaints. A civil Court also "deals with financial and corporeal rights and legal positions meant to protect by virtue of it, it does not includes commercial, realty, labor, personal status or endowment or inheritance cases".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.dubaicourts.gov.ae/portal/page?_pageid=292,451192&amp;_dad=portal&amp;_schema=PORTAL|title=Civil Court|last=|first=|date=|website=www.dubaicourts.gov.ae|publisher=|access-date=2016-11-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Common Law Courts ===

==== Dubai International Financial Center Courts (DIFC) ====
{{see also|DIFC Courts}}

The DIFC Courts are an independent English language [[common law]] judiciary, with jurisdiction governing civil and commercial disputes nationally, regionally and worldwide. The Courts began operations in 2006.

Originally, the jurisdiction of the DIFC Courts was limited to the geographical area of the [[Dubai International Financial Centre|DIFC]]. On October 2011, the signing of Dubai Law No 16.&lt;sup&gt;[[DIFC Courts|[1]]]&lt;/sup&gt; allowed the DIFC Courts to hear any local or international cases and to resolve commercial disputes with the consent of all parties.

==== Abu Dhabi Global Market Courts (ADGM) ====
Established in accordance with Abu Dhabi Law No (4) of 2013, [[Abu Dhabi Global Market|ADGM]] Courts are broadly modelled on the English judicial system. The common law of England, including the principles and rules of [[Equity (law)|Equity]], apply and form part of the law of the Abu Dhabi Global Market.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://adgm.complinet.com/net_file_store/new_rulebooks/a/p/Application_of_English_Law_Regulations_2015.pdf|title=Application of English Law Regulations 2015|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=ADGM|access-date=14 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Regulations for ADGM Courts were also drawn from Scots and Australian Federal law and have been tailored specifically to meet the requirements of ADGM Courts. The direct application of [[English law]] makes ADGM the first jurisdiction in the Middle East to adopt a similar approach to that of Singapore and Hong Kong.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.adgm.com/doing-business/adgm-courts/adgm-legal-framework/adgm-courts-legal-framework/|title=ADGM {{!}} ADGM Courts Legal Framework|website=www.adgm.com|access-date=2016-05-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Neither [[Dubai International Financial Centre|DIFC]] nor [[Abu Dhabi Global Market|ADGM]] courts have jurisdiction in criminal matters.

== Dubai Court System &amp; Ras Al Khaimah Court System ==
[[Dubai]] and [[Ras al-Khaimah|Ras Al Khaimah]] have two independent legal systems. For instance, Dubai’s court system three stages: The Court of First Instance, the Court of Appeal, and the Court of Cassation. Generally speaking, Dubai and Ras Al Khaimah courts consider local disputes concerning property and domestic disputes. However, it can also enforce foreign judgments, arbitration awards, and awards from other tribunals such as the dispute resolution bodies within the [[List of Free Trade Zones in Dubai|Free Zones]] &amp; Special Economic Zones. The legal systems of the two emirates are different from one another at several levels, but there is at least one important similarity which that of being independent from the federal system, and from the authority of the federal Supreme Court [http://www.attorneys.ae/news/uae-courts/]

== The Dubai Rental Disputes Center (RDC) ==
Established pursuant to Local Decree No.26 of 2013, the RDC has almost exclusive jurisdiction to settle disputes arising between landlords and tenants in Dubai, as per Dubai Law No.26 of 2007 Regulating Relationship between Landlords and Tenants in the Emirate of Dubai.

==Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR)==
There are various [[Alternative dispute resolution|Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR)]] mechanisms available for individuals and business in the UAE.

=== Arbitration ===
[[Arbitration]] has long been recognized as a dispute resolution mechanism in the region, and one that has been quoted in Islamic religious texts.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.tamimi.com/en/magazine/law-update/section-7/august-september-1/finding-your-path-arbitration-sharia-and-the-modern-middle-east.html|title=Finding your path: Arbitration, Sharia, and the Modern Middle East - Al Tamimi &amp; Company|last=Company|first=Al Tamimi &amp;|website=www.tamimi.com|access-date=2016-06-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; There has been numerous initiatives in the UAE to build up a strong presence in international commercial arbitration, including the codification of modern arbitration rules in federal and other laws.

==== Dubai International Arbitration Centre (DIAC) ====
First created in 1994 as the "Centre for Commercial Conciliation and Arbitration", the current DIAC is non-profit institution located in [[Dubai Chamber of Commerce and Industry|the Dubai Chamber of Commerce]] &amp; Industry (DCCI).

==== The DIFC/LCIA Arbitration Centre ====
A joint venture between the [[Dubai International Financial Centre]] (DIFC) and the [[London Court of International Arbitration]] (LCIA). The arbitration rules for the Center are closely modeled on the LCIA’s own rules with some modifications.

==== The International Islamic Centre for Reconciliation and Arbitration (IICRA) ====
IICRA is an international, independent, non-profit organization supporting the Islamic finance industry. The center settles all financial and commercial disputes that arise between financial or business institutions that choose to apply the provisions of Islamic law, Sharia principles, in resolving disputes that arise between these institutions and their clients or between them and third parties through reconciliation or arbitration.

=== Mediation ===

==== Employment disputes ====
Under the UAE Federal Labor Law, all unresolved employment disputes must be lodged first at the Ministry of Labour office where a settlement is negotiated between employers and workers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.mol.gov.ae/newmolgateway/english/newindex.aspx|title=Ministry of Labour|website=www.mol.gov.ae|access-date=2016-06-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; If the negotiations fail, either party may take up the matter at court. Since there are no trade unions in the UAE, collective disputes are handled by a special committee composed of the Minister of Labour, a Supreme Court Judge, and one expert. In Dubai, individuals can also refer to a similar service provided by the General Directorate of Residency and Foreigners Affairs as a first step before going to court. In 2015, a new department dedicated to resolving disputes between domestic helpers and sponsors has opened at the General Directorate of Residency and Foreigners Affairs (GDRFA) branch in Al Aweer. The department, a sub-branch of the Follow up on Illegals and Foreigners Sector, handles complaints from domestic helpers in Dubai.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://gulfnews.com/news/uae/crime/new-department-to-resolve-domestic-helpers-disputes-1.1538784|title=New department to resolve domestic helpers’ disputes|last=Bedirian|first=Razmig|date=2015-06-22|work=|newspaper=GulfNews|access-date=2016-11-01|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In Dubai, the General Department of Human Rights at Dubai Police receives individual and collective complaints filed by workers against their employers. Complaints would be related to living conditions, wages, and security and safety of labour accommodations and this service is accessible online.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.dubaipolice.gov.ae/dp/jsps/content/flat_content.do?contentCode=105947&lt;/ref&gt; 

As to civil servants in Dubai, employment complaints can be filed at the office of the Ruler of Dubai, which will attempt to find an agreement between the two parties. If it fails, it will issue the employee a letter addressed to the Dubai courts regarding the complaint.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.thenational.ae/news/uae-news/courts/navigating-labour-disputes-in-the-uae|title=Navigating labour disputes in the UAE {{!}} The National|website=www.thenational.ae|access-date=2016-06-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2015, the Crown Prince of Dubai has approved the establishment of the Dubai government staff central grievances committee.

Claims are handled by experienced mediators under the supervision of a judge.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.dubaicourts.gov.ae/jimage/Info_services/Eng/A8%20eng.pdf|title=Dubai Courts Centre for Amicable Dispute Resolution|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Once a settlement is reached, the legally enforceable agreement will be signed by the parties and attested by a judge.

In [[physics]], [[chemistry]] and related fields, a '''kinetic scheme''' is a network of states and connections between them representing the scheme of a dynamical process. Usually a kinetic scheme represents a [[Markovian process]], while for non-Markovian processes generalized kinetic schemes are used. Figure 1 shows an illustration of a kinetic scheme.

==A Markovian kinetic scheme==

===Mathematical description===
A '''kinetic scheme''' is a network (a [[directed graph]]) of distinct states (although repetition of states may occur and this depends on the system), where each pair of states ''i'' and ''j'' are associated with directional rates, &lt;math&gt;A_{ij}&lt;/math&gt; (and &lt;math&gt;A_{ji}&lt;/math&gt;). It is described with a [[master equation]]: a first-order [[differential equation]] for the [[probability]] &lt;math&gt;\vec{P}&lt;/math&gt; of a system to occupy each one its states at time ''t'' (element ''i'' represents state ''i''). Written in a matrix form, this states: &lt;math&gt; \frac{d\vec{P}}{dt}=\mathbf{A}\vec{P}&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{A}&lt;/math&gt; is the matrix of connections (rates) &lt;math&gt;A_{ij}&lt;/math&gt;.

In a '''Markovian kinetic scheme''' the connections are constant with respect to time (and any jumping time probability density function for state ''i'' is an exponential, with a rate equal the value of all the exiting connections). 

When [[detailed balance]] exists in a system, the relation &lt;math&gt;A_{ji}P_{i}(t\rightarrow\infty)=A_{ij}P_{j}(t\rightarrow\infty)&lt;/math&gt; holds for every connected states ''i'' and ''j''. The result represents the fact that any closed loop in a Markovian network in equilibrium does not have a net flow.

Matrix &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{A}&lt;/math&gt; can also represent birth and death, meaning that probability is injected (birth) or taken from (death) the system, where then, the process is not in equilibrium. These terms are different than a [[birth-death process]], where there is simply a '''linear kinetic scheme'''.

===Specific Markovian kinetic schemes===
* A [[birth-death process]] is a linear one-dimensional Markovian kinetic scheme.
* [[Michaelis–Menten kinetics]] are a type of a Markovian kinetic scheme when solved with the steady state assumption for the creation of intermediates in the reaction pathway.

==Generalizations of Markovian kinetic schemes==

* '''A kinetic scheme with time dependent rates''': When the connections depend on the actual time (i.e. matrix &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{A}&lt;/math&gt; depends on the time, &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{A}\rightarrow\mathbf{A}(t)&lt;/math&gt; ), the process is not Markovian, and the master equation obeys, &lt;math&gt; \frac{d\vec{P}}{dt}=\mathbf{A}(t)\vec{P}&lt;/math&gt;.  The reason for a time dependent rates is, for example, a time dependent external field applied on a Markovian kinetic scheme (thus making the process a not Markovian one).
* '''A semi-Markovian kinetic scheme''': When the connections represent multi exponential jumping time probability density functions, the process is [[Semi-Markov process|semi-Markovian]], and the equation of motion is an [[integro-differential equation]] termed the generalized master equation: &lt;math&gt; \frac{d\vec{P}}{dt}= \int^t_0 \mathbf{A}(t- \tau )\vec{P}( \tau )d \tau &lt;/math&gt;.
An example for such a process is a [[reduced dimensions form]]. 
* '''The Fokker Planck equation''': when expanding the master equation of the kinetic scheme in a continuous space coordinate, one finds the [[Fokker Planck equation]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8044">'''Kiss up kick down''' (or '''suck up kick down''') is a [[neologism]] used to describe the situation where middle level employees in an organization are polite and [[flattering]] to superiors but [[abusive supervision|abusive to subordinates]].&lt;ref name=Paton1&gt;[http://www.midstaffspublicinquiry.com/sites/default/files/transcripts/Tuesday_21_June_2011_-_transcript.pdf Mid Staffordshire Public Inquiry Transcript - day 103 - 21 June 2011]&lt;/ref&gt; It is believed to have originated in the US, with the first documented use having occurred in 1993. The concept can be applied to any social interaction where one person believes they have power over another person and believes that another person has power over them.&lt;ref name=Paton2&gt;Calum Paton The Policy of NHS Deficits and NHS Re-form in Health Policy and Politics 2007&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=McNamara&gt;JJ Mearsheimer, D Shapley [http://mearsheimer.uchicago.edu/pdfs/A0020x1.pdf MCNAMARA'S WAR]  Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists, 00963402, Jul/Aug93, Vol.49, Issue 6&lt;/ref&gt;

== Examples of use ==
===Robert McNamara===
The ''Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists'' described [[Robert McNamara]], an American business executive and the eighth [[United States Secretary of Defense]], as a classic case of the ''kiss up, kick down'' personality in August 1993.&lt;ref name=McNamara/&gt;

===John R. Bolton===
On day 2 of the Senate confirmation hearings, April 12, 2005, for [[John R. Bolton]], a [[George W. Bush|Bush]] nomination for the US representative to the UN, the Senate panel focused on allegations that Bolton pressured intelligence analysts. Former State Department intelligence chief [[Carl Ford|Carl W. Ford Jr.]] characterized Bolton as a "''kiss-up, kick-down'' sort of guy", implying that he was always ready to please whoever had authority over him, while having very little regard for people working under him.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.usatoday.com/news/washington/2005-04-12-bolton_x.htm | work=USA Today | title=Critic says Bolton a 'kiss-up, kick-down sort of guy' | first1=Barbara | last1=Slavin | date=April 12, 2005 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===National Health Service===
Calum Paton, Professor of Health Policy at [[Keele University]], describes ''kiss up kick down'' as a prevalent feature of the UK [[National Health Service]] culture. He raised this point when giving evidence at the [[Stafford_Hospital_scandal#Public_inquiry|Stafford Hospital scandal public inquiry]]. Credit is centralised and blame devolved. "''Kiss up kick down'' means that your middle level people will ''kiss-up'', they will please their masters, political or otherwise, and they will ''kick down'' to blame somebody else when things go wrong."
&lt;ref name=Paton1/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Robert Francis (barrister)|Robert Francis]] (Nov 29, 2011) [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dwnVE4GPbhs Organisational Culture seminar: opening statement]&lt;/ref&gt; 
 
For example, NHS Trust bosses are nervous of reporting deficits and seek to under-report until it's too late. They seek to please their political superiors in the short term and shift blame down the line.&lt;ref name=Paton2/&gt;

==Blame in organizations==
Some [[systems theory|systems theorists]] and [[management consultant]]s, such as [[Gerald Weinberg]], see the flow of [[blame]] in an [[organization]] as one of the most important indicators of that organization's robustness and integrity. Blame flowing downwards, from management to staff, or laterally between professionals, indicates organizational failure. In a blame culture, problem-solving is replaced by blame-avoidance. Weinberg emphasizes that blame coming from the top generates "fear, malaise, errors, accidents, and [[passive-aggressive]] responses from the bottom", with those at the bottom feeling powerless and lacking emotional safety.&lt;ref name=Weinberg&gt;Gerald M. Weinberg (March 5, 2006) [http://www.ayeconference.com/beyondblaming/ ''Beyond Blaming''], AYE Conference&lt;/ref&gt;

===Kick up kiss down===
''Kick up kiss-down'' has been suggested as a viable more healthy dynamic.&lt;ref&gt;Harvey Schachter (Jul. 25 2011) [https://www.theglobeandmail.com/report-on-business/careers/management/kicking-up-kissing-down/article616182/ Kicking up, kissing down]  The Globe and Mail&lt;/ref&gt; Blame flowing upwards in a hierarchy, Weinberg argues, proves that superiors can take [[moral responsibility|responsibility]] for their orders to their inferiors, and supply them with the resources required to do their jobs.&lt;ref name=Weinberg/&gt;

==In workplace bullying==
{{Main|Workplace bullying}}
The workplace bully is often expert at knowing how to work the system. They can spout all the current management buzzwords about supportive management but basically use it as a cover. By keeping their [[abusive]] behavior hidden, any charges made by individuals about his or her bullying will always come down to your word against the bully's. They may have a ''kiss up kick down'' personality, wherein they are always highly cooperative, respectful, and caring when talking to upper management but the opposite when it comes to their relationship with those whom they supervise.&lt;ref&gt;Petrecca, L. (December 27 2010) Bullying by the boss is common but hard to fix. ''USA Today'' &lt;/ref&gt; Bullies tend to [[ingratiate]] themselves to their bosses while [[intimidating]] subordinates.&lt;ref&gt;(15 Oct 2010) [http://www.aftlocal1904.org/bully_workshop.pdf How to manage a bully boss - Council of NJ State College Locals, AFT]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;
Mary Donohue (2 Oct 2013) [http://www.huffingtonpost.ca/mary-donohue/bad-managers_b_4017881.html Fighting Back Against the Tyranny of the Manager] The Huffington Post Csnada&lt;/ref&gt; The bully may be socially popular with others in management, including those who will determine
the bully's fate. Often, a workplace bully will have mastered ''kiss up kick down'' tactics that hide their abusive side from superiors who review their performance.&lt;ref&gt; DC Yamada (2008) Workplace bullying and ethical leadership - Journal of Values-Based Leadership, Vol. 1, No. 2, p. 49&lt;/ref&gt;

As a consequence of this ''kiss up kick down'' strategy:&lt;ref&gt;Robert Killoren (2014) The Toll of Workplace Bullying - Research Management Review, Volume 20, Number 1&lt;/ref&gt; 
* a bully’s mistakes are always concealed or blamed on underlings or circumstances beyond their control
* a bully keeps the target under constant [[Occupational stress|stress]]
* a bully’s power base is fear, not respect
* a bully withholds information from subordinates and keeps the information flow top-down only
* a bully blames [[Workplace conflict|conflicts]] and problems on subordinate’s lack of competence, poor attitude, and/or character flaws
* a bully creates an unnatural work environment where people constantly walk on eggshells and are compelled to behave in ways they normally would not.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="26893">The following is a list of international standards that are relevant to the protection of children in migration and mobility. These standards are legally binding conventions, treaties and directives. The international legal framework concerning children in migration and mobility provides safeguards in relation to asylum and international protection, labour regulations, the prevention of sexual exploitation and trafficking in human beings, international standards for migrant workers, child victims of crime and the judiciary, as well as international private law for child protection and family matters.

==International==
International standards of the United Nations, once adopted by the General Assembly of the United Nations, are open to signature and ratification by UN Member States worldwide. When a national government ratifies a Convention, the standards afforded under the Convention have to be reflected in national law and policy and become thereby applicable law in the country. The same procedure of ratification applies to the Conventions of the Council of Europe and the Hague Conference of Private International Law. In addition to the Member States of these inter-governmental organisations, non-Member States can also accede to the Conventions.

===The UN Convention on the Rights of the Child ===
The [[UN Convention on the Rights of the Child]] defines the human rights of children and the correlated obligations of states. It provides also for obligations of parents and caregivers, public authorities, private service providers and the private sector. These rights and obligations can guide caseworkers and case officers in all measures, decisions and considerations for children on the move. The Convention supports caseworkers and officers in navigating the complex body of international, European and national laws. It provides the overarching framework and the strongest point of reference for safeguarding children.

The Convention is complemented by three Optional Protocols, one on the [[Optional Protocol on the Sale of Children, Child Prostitution and Child Pornography|sale of children, child prostitution and child pornography]], another one on the [[Optional Protocol on the Involvement of Children in Armed Conflict|involvement of children in armed conflict]], and a third and more recent Protocol on a communications procedure for children.&lt;ref&gt;https://treaties.un.org/doc/source/signature/2012/CTC_4-11d.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; States that have ratified the Convention report to the [[Committee on the Rights of the Child]], the international Treaty Body mandated to monitor the implementation of the Convention by States Parties. The Committee reviews and comments on State Party reports on the implementation of the Convention and develops General Comments, in which it elaborates on specific articles of the Convention.

===The Hague Conference on Private International Law===
The [[Hague Conference on Private International Law]] (HCCH) is a global inter-governmental organisation that has developed standards for the transnational cooperation on child protection and family matters. The key themes addressed by the Conventions of the Hague Conference include transnational child protection, inter-country adoption, cross-border parental child abduction as well as matters of parental responsibility and contact involving different countries.

The Hague Conventions in the area of transnational child protection and family law have several common characteristics. They ensure the automatic mutual recognition of official decisions taken by one Contracting State in other Contracting States. They enable and facilitate the cooperation between the Contracting States, including through the establishment of central authorities and the development of unified procedures. By facilitating practical matters, such as the translation of documents, information exchange and the use of standardised model forms, the Conventions aim to simplify and expedite cross-border procedures and the enforcement of official decisions.

The Hague Conventions are innovative as they work primarily with the concept of ‘habitual residence’ of the child, rather than ‘nationality’, in order to determine which state has the jurisdiction over a case.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.hcch.net/&lt;/ref&gt;

=== The UN Refugee Convention and its Protocol ===
The UN Refugee Convention and its Protocol regulate the right of persons to seek international protection. Children enjoy special safeguards and have a right to have their asylum application examined individually. Child-specific grounds of persecution need to be considered irrespective of whether the child applies alone or together with a parent or caregiver. The European Union Member States have re-elaborated these standards for the EU context and have adopted a series of Directives regulating the qualification and reception conditions of asylum seekers in the EU as well as asylum procedures and matters of return.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.unhcr.org/pages/49da0e466.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Commissioner for Refugees, Guidelines on International Protection, Child Asylum Claims, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Council of Europe ==

===The European Social Charter===
The [[European Social Charter]] sets out rights and freedoms and establishes a supervisory mechanism mandated to monitor how States Parties implement the Charter in practice. The rights afforded under the Charter concern all individuals in their daily lives as they relate, for instance, to housing, health, education, employment, legal and social protection, free movement of persons and non-discrimination. The Charter was first adopted in 1961 and was subsequently revised. The 1996 revised European Social Charter entered into force in 1999.

The European Committee of Social Rights issued in October 2015 a Statement of interpretation on the rights of refugees under the European Social Charter, which provides guidance on the application of the European Social Charter to refugees and asylum seekers.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.coe.int/t/dghl/monitoring/socialcharter/Presentation/AboutCharter_en.asp#Les_droits_garantis_par_la_Charte&lt;/ref&gt;

===Council of Europe Convention on the Protection of Children against Sexual Exploitation and Sexual Abuse (2007)===
The [[Council of Europe Convention on the Protection of Children against Sexual Exploitation and Sexual Abuse]] is the first instrument to establish the various forms of sexual abuse and exploitation of children as criminal offences, including abuse committed in the home or family, with the use of force, coercion or threats. Preventive measures outlined in the Convention include the screening, recruitment and training of persons working in contact with children, making children aware of the risks and teaching them to protect themselves, as well as monitoring measures for offenders and potential offenders.

The Convention also establishes programmes to support victims, encourages people to report suspected sexual exploitation and abuse, and sets up telephone and internet helplines for children. It ensures that certain types of conduct are classified as criminal offences, such as engaging in sexual activities with a child below the legal age and the sexual exploitation of children in prostitution and pornography. The Convention criminalises the solicitation of children for sexual purposes (grooming) and by travelling sex offenders who can be prosecuted for some offences even when the act is committed abroad. The Convention ensures that child victims are protected during judicial proceedings, for example with regard to their identity and privacy.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.coe.int/en/web/conventions/full-list/-/conventions/treaty/201&lt;/ref&gt;

===Council of Europe Convention on Action against Trafficking in Human Beings (2005)===
The [[Council of Europe Convention on Action against Trafficking in Human Beings]] is a comprehensive treaty mainly focused on the protection of victims of trafficking and the safeguard of their rights. It also aims at preventing trafficking as well as prosecuting traffickers. The Convention applies to all forms of trafficking; whether national or transnational, whether or not related to organised crime and whoever the victim, women, men or children and whatever the form of exploitation, sexual exploitation, forced labour or services, or other.

The Convention provides for the setting up of an independent monitoring mechanism (GRETA), which monitors the States Parties’ compliance with its provisions.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.coe.int/en/web/conventions/full-list/-/conventions/treaty/197 
&lt;/ref&gt;

==European Union==

===Directives – EU law===
Within the European Union, EU Directives are legally binding and constitute EU law that needs to be transposed into the national law of Member States within a prescribed period of time. When countries infringe against or violate European standards that are in force within the country, the European Courts offer the possibility to seek legal remedy and to claim the rights afforded under international or European law.

====Reception Conditions Directive====
The ''Council Directive 2003/9/EC of 27 January 2003 laying down minimum standards for the reception of asylum seekers'' sets out minimum reception standards for asylum applicants. The aim is to ensure that the applicants have a dignified standard of living and that comparable living conditions are afforded to them in all Member States. At the same time, the Directive also limits asylum applicants’ secondary movements.&lt;ref&gt;http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?qid=1444941010485&amp;uri=URISERV:l33150&lt;/ref&gt;

====Asylum Procedures Directive====
The ''Directive 2013/32/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council of 26 June 2013 on common procedures for granting and withdrawing international protection'' repealed Directive 2005/85/EC on minimum standards on procedures for granting and withdrawing refugee status in European Union countries and sets up EU-wide procedures for granting and withdrawing international protection (refugee status and the protection given to people who are not refugees but who would risk serious harm if returned to their country of origin).&lt;ref&gt;http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?qid=1444941010485&amp;uri=URISERV:23010502_1&lt;/ref&gt;

====Qualification Directive====
The full name of the Qualification Directive is the ''Directive 2011/95/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council of 13 December 2011 on standards for the qualification of third-country nationals or stateless persons as beneficiaries of international protection, for a uniform status for refugees or for persons eligible for subsidiary protection, and for the content of the protection granted''.

The Qualification Directive establishes common grounds to grant international protection. Its provisions also foresee a series of rights on protection from non refoulement, residence permits, travel documents, access to employment, access to education, social welfare, healthcare, access to accommodation, access to integration facilities, as well as specific provisions for children and vulnerable persons.&lt;ref&gt;http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/ALL/?uri=CELEX:32011L0095
&lt;/ref&gt;

====[[Dublin Regulation|Dublin III Regulation]]====
With the full name [[Dublin Regulation|''Regulation (EU) No 604/2013 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 26 June 2013 establishing the criteria and mechanisms for determining the Member State responsible for examining an application for international protection lodged in one of the Member States by a third-country national or a stateless person'']].

Regulation (EU) No 604/2013 (Dublin III Council Regulation), replacing Council Regulation (EC) No 343/2003 (Dublin II Regulation), lays down the criteria and mechanisms for determining which EU country is responsible for examining an asylum application.&lt;ref&gt;http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?qid=1444941010485&amp;uri=URISERV:23010503_1 
&lt;/ref&gt;

====Return Directive====
The ''Directive 2008/115/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 16 December 2008 on common standards and procedures in Member States for returning illegally staying third-country nationals'' establishes common standards and procedures for EU countries, whereby illegally staying non-EU nationals may be removed from their territories. It lays down provisions for terminating illegal stays, detaining non-EU nationals with the aim of removing them and procedural safeguards.&lt;ref&gt;http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?qid=1444941010485&amp;uri=URISERV:jl0014
&lt;/ref&gt;

====Family Reunification Directive====
The purpose of the ''Council Directive 2003/86/EC of 22 September 2003 on the right to family reunification'' is to determine the conditions under which non-EU nationals residing lawfully on the territory of EU countries may exercise the right to family reunification. The Directive aims to establish common rules of law relating to the right to family reunification. The intention is to enable family members of non-EU nationals residing lawfully on the territory of the European Union (EU) to join them in the EU country in which they are residing. The objective is to protect the family unit and to facilitate the integration of nationals of non-member countries. The Directive does not apply to Ireland, Denmark and the United Kingdom. In addition, it does not preclude any more favourable conditions recognised by national legislation.&lt;ref&gt;http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?qid=1444941010485&amp;uri=URISERV:l33118
&lt;/ref&gt;

====Conditions of admission of third-country nationals for the purposes of studies, pupil exchange, unremunerated training or voluntary service====
The aim of the ''Council Directive 2004/114/EC of 13 December 2004 on the conditions of admission of third-country nationals for the purposes of studies, pupil exchange, unremunerated training or voluntary service'' is to harmonise national legislation relating to the conditions of admission of third-country nationals for the purposes of studies, pupil exchange, unremunerated training or voluntary service.&lt;ref&gt;http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?qid=1444941010485&amp;uri=URISERV:l33163a
&lt;/ref&gt;

====Right of Union citizens and their family members to move and reside freely within the territory of the Member States====
''European Parliament and Council Directive 2004/38/EC of 29 April 2004 on the right of citizens of the Union and their family members to move and reside freely within the territory of the Member States'' brings together the piecemeal measures found in the complex body of legislation that had previously governed this matter. The measures are designed, among other things, to encourage citizens to exercise their right to move and reside freely within EU countries, to cut back administrative formalities to the bare essentials, to provide a better definition of the status of family members, to limit the scope for refusing entry or terminating the right of residence and to introduce a new right of permanent residence.&lt;ref&gt;http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?qid=1444941010485&amp;uri=URISERV:l33152&lt;/ref&gt;

====Brussels II bis Regulation====
[[Brussels II|''Council Regulation (EC) No 2201/2003 of 27 November 2003 concerning jurisdiction and the recognition and enforcement of judgments in matrimonial matters and the matters of parental responsibility'']] brings together in a single legal instrument the provisions on divorce and parental responsibility, with a view to facilitating the work of judges and legal practitioners and to regulating the exercise of cross-border rights of access.

It facilitates the application of the Dublin II Regulation, which makes it possible to determine the European Union (EU) country responsible for examining an asylum application.&lt;ref&gt;http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=URISERV:l33081&lt;/ref&gt;

==Conflicting mandates==
In the public debate on international migration, the mandates and interests of different agencies and disciplines can sometimes appear to be in conflict. International human rights standards provide the common basis for decision makers. In the context of children, the [[UN Convention on the Rights of the Child]] provides the basis for promoting the best interests of children in all contexts and situations.

==Non-legally binding standards==
In addition to legally binding conventions, treaties and directives, the UN, the Council of Europe and the European Union have developed a large number of political recommendations, regulations and guidelines, which are not legally binding but have nonetheless an important value as they aid in the interpretation and implementation of legal standards.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="13416">In [[classical mechanics]], '''Maupertuis's principle''' (named after [[Pierre Louis Maupertuis]]), states that the path followed by a physical system is the one of least length (with a suitable interpretation of ''path'' and ''length'').  It is a special case of the more generally stated [[principle of least action]].  Using the [[calculus of variations]], it results in an [[integral equation]] formulation of the [[equations of motion]] for the system.

==Mathematical formulation==

Maupertuis's principle states that the true path of a system described by &lt;math&gt;N&lt;/math&gt; [[generalized coordinates]] &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{q} = \left( q_{1}, q_{2}, \ldots, q_{N} \right)&lt;/math&gt; between two specified states &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{q}_{1}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{q}_{2}&lt;/math&gt; is an extremum (i.e., a [[stationary point]], a minimum, maximum or saddle point) of the  [[Action (physics)#Abbreviated action (functional)|abbreviated action functional]]

:&lt;math&gt;
\mathcal{S}_{0}[\mathbf{q}(t)] \ \stackrel{\mathrm{def}}{=}\  
\int \mathbf{p} \cdot d\mathbf{q} 
&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{p} = \left( p_{1}, p_{2}, \ldots, p_{N} \right)&lt;/math&gt; are the conjugate momenta of the generalized coordinates, defined by the equation 

:&lt;math&gt;
p_{k} \ \stackrel{\mathrm{def}}{=}\  \frac{\partial L}{\partial\dot{q}_{k}}
&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;L(\mathbf{q},\dot{\mathbf{q}},t)&lt;/math&gt; is the [[Lagrangian mechanics|Lagrangian]] [[function (mathematics)|function]] for the system.  In other words, any ''first-order'' perturbation of the path results in (at most) ''second-order'' changes in &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{S}_{0}&lt;/math&gt;.  Note that the abbreviated action &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{S}_{0}&lt;/math&gt; is a [[Functional (mathematics)|functional]] (i.e. a function from a vector space into its underlying scalar field), which in this case takes as its input a function (i.e. the pathes between the two specified states).

==Jacobi's formulation==

For many systems, the kinetic energy &lt;math&gt;T&lt;/math&gt; is quadratic in the generalized velocities &lt;math&gt;\dot{\mathbf{q}}&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;
T = \frac{1}{2} \frac{d\mathbf{q}}{dt} \cdot \mathbf{M} \cdot \frac{d\mathbf{q}}{dt}
&lt;/math&gt;

although the '''mass tensor''' &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{M}&lt;/math&gt; may be a complicated function of the generalized coordinates &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{q}&lt;/math&gt;.  For such systems, a simple relation relates the kinetic energy, the generalized momenta and the generalized velocities

:&lt;math&gt;
2 T = \mathbf{p} \cdot \dot{\mathbf{q}}
&lt;/math&gt;

provided that the potential energy &lt;math&gt;V(\mathbf{q})&lt;/math&gt; does not involve the generalized velocities.  By defining a normalized distance or [[Metric (mathematics)|metric]] &lt;math&gt;ds&lt;/math&gt; in the space of generalized coordinates

:&lt;math&gt;
ds^{2} = d\mathbf{q} \cdot \mathbf{M} \cdot d\mathbf{q}
&lt;/math&gt;

one may immediately recognize the mass tensor as a [[metric tensor]]. The kinetic energy may be written in a massless form

:&lt;math&gt;
T = \frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{ds}{dt} \right)^{2}
&lt;/math&gt;

or, equivalently,

:&lt;math&gt;
2 T dt = \mathbf{p} \cdot d\mathbf{q} = \sqrt{2 T} \ ds.
&lt;/math&gt;

Hence, the abbreviated action can be written

:&lt;math&gt;
\mathcal{S}_0 \ \stackrel{\mathrm{def}}{=}\  \int \mathbf{p} \cdot d\mathbf{q} = 
 \int ds \, \sqrt{2}\sqrt{E_\text{tot} - V(\mathbf{q})}
&lt;/math&gt;

since the kinetic energy &lt;math&gt;T = E_\text{tot} - V(\mathbf{q})&lt;/math&gt; equals the (constant) total energy &lt;math&gt;E_\text{tot}&lt;/math&gt; minus the potential energy &lt;math&gt;V(\mathbf{q})&lt;/math&gt;.   In particular, if the potential energy is a constant, then Jacobi's principle reduces to minimizing the path length &lt;math&gt;s = \int ds&lt;/math&gt; in the space of the generalized coordinates, which is equivalent to [[Hertz's principle of least curvature]].

==Comparison with Hamilton's principle==

[[Hamilton's principle]] and Maupertuis's principle are occasionally confused and both have been called the [[principle of least action]].  They differ from each other in three important ways: 
* ''their definition of the [[action (physics)|action]]...'' 
:::Hamilton's principle uses &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{S} \ \stackrel{\mathrm{def}}{=}\  \int L \, dt&lt;/math&gt;, the integral of the [[Lagrangian mechanics|Lagrangian]] over [[time]], varied between two fixed end times &lt;math&gt;t_{1}&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;t_{2}&lt;/math&gt; and endpoints &lt;math&gt;q_1&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;q_2&lt;/math&gt;.  By contrast, Maupertuis's principle uses the abbreviated action integral over the [[generalized coordinates]], varied along all constant energy paths ending at &lt;math&gt;q_1&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;q_2&lt;/math&gt;.

*''the solution that they determine...''
:::Hamilton's principle determines the trajectory &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{q}(t)&lt;/math&gt; as a function of time, whereas Maupertuis's principle determines only the shape of the trajectory in the generalized coordinates.  For example, Maupertuis's principle determines the shape of the ellipse on which a particle moves under the influence of an inverse-square central force such as [[gravitation|gravity]], but does not describe ''per se'' how the particle moves along that trajectory.  (However, this time parameterization may be determined from the trajectory itself in subsequent calculations using the conservation of energy.)  By contrast, Hamilton's principle directly specifies the motion along the ellipse as a function of time.

*''...and the constraints on the variation.''
:::Maupertuis's principle requires that the two endpoint states &lt;math&gt;q_{1}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;q_{2}&lt;/math&gt; be given and that energy be conserved along every trajectory.  By contrast, Hamilton's principle does not require the conservation of energy, but does require that the endpoint times &lt;math&gt;t_{1}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;t_{2}&lt;/math&gt; be  specified as well as the endpoint states &lt;math&gt;q_{1}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;q_{2}&lt;/math&gt;.

==History==

Maupertuis was the first to publish a ''principle of least action'', where he defined ''action'' as &lt;math&gt;\int v \, ds&lt;/math&gt;, which was to be minimized over all paths connecting two specified points.  However, Maupertuis applied the principle only to light, not matter (see [[s:Accord between different laws of Nature that seemed incompatible|the 1744 Maupertuis reference below]]).  He arrived at the principle by considering [[Snell's law]] for the [[refraction]] of [[light]], which [[Fermat]] had explained by [[Fermat's principle]], that light follows the path of shortest ''time'', not distance.  This troubled Maupertuis, since he felt that time and distance should be on an equal footing: "why should light prefer the path of shortest time over that of distance?"  Accordingly, Maupertuis asserts with no further justification the principle of least action as equivalent but more fundamental than [[Fermat's principle]], and uses it to derive [[Snell's law]].  Maupertuis specifically states that light does not follow the same laws as material objects.

A few months later, well before Maupertuis's work appeared in print, [[Leonhard Euler]] independently defined action in its modern abbreviated form &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{S}_{0} \ \stackrel{\mathrm{def}}{=}\  \int m v \, ds \ \stackrel{\mathrm{def}}{=}\  \int p \, dq&lt;/math&gt; and applied it to the motion of a particle, but not to light (see [[s:Methodus inveniendi/Additamentum II|the 1744 Euler reference below]]).  Euler also recognized that the principle only held when the speed was a function only of position, i.e., when the total energy was conserved.  (The mass factor in the action and the requirement for energy conservation were not relevant to Maupertuis, who was concerned only with light.)  Euler used this principle to derive the equations of motion of a particle in uniform motion, in a uniform and non-uniform force field, and in a central force field.  Euler's approach is entirely consistent with the modern understanding of Maupertuis's principle described above, except that he insisted that the action should always be a minimum, rather than a stationary point.

Two years later, Maupertuis cites Euler's 1744 work as a "beautiful application of my principle to the motion of the planets" and goes on to apply the principle of least action to the lever problem in mechanical equilibrium and to perfectly elastic and perfectly inelastic collisions (see [[s:Derivation of the laws of motion and equilibrium from a metaphysical principle|the 1746 publication below]]).  Thus, Maupertuis takes credit for conceiving the principle of least action as a ''general'' principle applicable to all physical systems (not merely to light), whereas the historical evidence suggests that Euler was the one to make this intuitive leap.   Notably, Maupertuis's definitions of the action and protocols for minimizing it in this paper are inconsistent with the modern approach described above.  Thus, Maupertuis's published work does not contain a single example in which he used Maupertuis's principle (as presently understood).

In 1751, Maupertuis's priority for the principle of least action was challenged in print (''Nova Acta Eruditorum'' of Leipzig) by an old acquaintance, Johann Samuel Koenig, who quoted a 1707 letter purportedly from [[Gottfried Leibniz|Leibniz]] that described results similar to those derived by Euler in 1744.  However, Maupertuis and others demanded that Koenig produce the original of the letter to authenticate its having been written by Leibniz.  Koenig only had a copy and no clue as to the whereabouts of the original.  Consequently, [[s:Translation:Investigation of the letter of Leibniz|the Berlin Academy under Euler's direction declared the letter to be a forgery]] and that its President, Maupertuis, could continue to claim priority for having invented the principle.  Koenig continued to fight for Leibniz's priority and soon luminaries such as [[Voltaire]] and the King of Prussia, [[Frederick II of Prussia|Frederick II]] were engaged in the quarrel.  However, no progress was made until the turn of the twentieth century, when other independent copies of Leibniz's letter were discovered.

A '''non-linguistic meaning''' is an actual or possible derivation from sentience, which is not associated with signs that have any original or primary intent of communication.{{clarify|post-text=what?|date=November 2011}} It is a general [[jargon|term of art]] used to capture a number of different senses of the word "meaning", independently from its linguistic uses.

== Meaning as internal interpretation ==
The sense that sentient creatures have that the various objects of our universe are linked is commonly referred to as a person's sense of "meaning". This is the sense of meaning at work when asking a person when they leave a theater, "What did that movie mean to you?" In short, the word "meaning" can sometimes be used to describe the ''interpretations'' that people have of the world. Example: "Chunks are pieces of information linked and bound by meaning. (Remembering details vs. getting an overall meaning) links individual memory traces together, to create conceptual chunks." (Dr. Barbara Oakley, A Mind for Numbers, p.&amp;nbsp;55).

The field of [[semantics]] is often understood as a branch of [[linguistics]], but this is not strictly true.{{citation needed|date=October 2012}} Basic or non-idealized '''meaning''' as a type of [[semantics]] is a branch of [[psychology]] and [[ethics]] and reflects the original use of the term "meaning" as understood early in the 20th century by [[Lady Welby]] after her daughter had translated the term "semantics" from French. On the other hand, meaning, in so far as it was later objectified by not considering particular situations and the real intentions of speakers and writers, examines the ways in which words, phrases, and sentences can seem to have meaning. Objectified semantics is contrasted with communication-focused semantics where understanding the intent and assumptions of particular speakers and writers is primary as in the idea that people mean and not words, sentences or propositions. An underlying difference is that where causes are identified with relations or laws then it is normal to objectify meaning and consider it a branch of linguistics, while if causes are identified with particular agents, objects, or forces as if to cause means to influence as most historians and practical people assume, then real or non-objectified meaning is primary and we are dealing with intent or purpose as an aspect of human psychology, especially since human intent can be and often is independent of language and linguistics.

We are all familiar with how good or bad reputation can encourage or discourage us from reading or studying  about certain people, positions, or philosophies even before we have studied them. This is normally called pre-judgment or prejudice. To determine whether a reputation is deserved we normally have to carry out extensive and balanced research into human intent and assumptions in psychology, and in the sphere of language and linguistics where this research tends to focus not only on the differences between denotation and connotation, but especially on the presence and often tenacious character of value connotation, that is, the good or bad associations we make with words. Re-definition can change denotation for some people, but value connotation almost always remains, and is merely re-directed at a different target. Unfortunately, while dictionaries mention the most common denotations or main meanings we associate with words they normally ignore value connotation. Indeed, it is value connotation or the effect of using it which results in denotation becoming prejudicial, even denotation which is imagined to be fair,  neutral or objective. Indeed, much rhetoric is based on selecting words more for their value associations than for their denotations, and to expose and correct this bad habit it is normally wise to focus on the most likely intent and assumptions of particular people than to imagine that words have meaning in themselves or that either meaning or language can be genuinely objective, since in that process we are likely to forget the existence and dominating character of value connotation which is subjective in a bad sense, that is, which makes persuasion more an aspect of rhetoric and deception rather than judging people, positions and philosophy more by weight of evidence or legitimate argumentation.

One way to operationally define the meaningfulness of a stimulus is to look at the slope of the response time versus response probability line (Tarnow, 2007).&lt;ref&gt;Tarnow, E., ''[http://cogprints.org/5366/ Response probability and latency: a straight line, an operational definition of meaning and the structure of short term memory]'', cogprints.org 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Semantic meaning==
{{See also|Biosemiotics}}
{{tone|section|date=August 2017}}
In another sense, the word "meaning" can be used to describe the internal workings of the mind, independently of any linguistic activity. This sort of meaning is deeply psychological. If we look for other uses we can find intent, feeling, implication, importance, value, and signification. Since the negative form-- "meaningless"—challenges and would deny these uses, experts believe that underlying them all are understanding and understandability.

One approach to this way of understanding meaning was the psychosocial theorist [[Erik Erikson]]. Erikson had a certain perspective on the role of meaning in the process of human bodily development and socialization. Within his model, a "meaning" is the external source of gratification associated with the human erogenous zones and their respective modes. See [[imprinting (psychology)]] for some related topics.

Some communication by [[body language]] arises out of bodily signals that follow directly out of human instinct.  [[Blushing]], [[tears]], [[erections]] and the [[startle reaction]] are examples. This type of communication is usually unintentional, but nevertheless conveys certain information to anyone present.

== Natural meaning ==

This was coined by [[Paul Grice]], and describes associations in the natural world, as in the sentence, "Those clouds mean rain", "mean" is associating cloud with rain.

Another example of natural meaning is the weathervane: when it points in a certain direction, that is taken to mean that the wind is blowing in the same direction.

=== Consequences and meaning ===

Still another perspective comes courtesy of the [[Pragmatism|Pragmatists]], who insist that the meaning of an expression lies in its consequences. Philosopher and [[polymath]] [[Charles Sanders Peirce]] wrote the following:
{{quote|The whole function of thought is to produce [[Habit (psychology)|habits]] of action... To develop its meaning, we have, therefore, simply to determine what habits it produces, for what a thing means is simply what habits it involves. Now, the identity of a habit depends on how it might lead us to act, not merely under such circumstances as are likely to arise, but under such as might possibly occur, no matter how improbable they may be.

...I only desire to point out how impossible it is that we should have an idea in our minds which relates to anything but conceived sensible effects of things. Our idea of anything is our idea of its sensible effects; and if we fancy that we have any other we deceive ourselves.|(from the essay "[http://www.peirce.org/writings/p119.html How to Make Our Ideas Clear]", hosted courtesy of peirce.org).}}

Outside of the Pragmatic tradition was Canadian 20th century philosopher of media [[Marshall McLuhan]]. His famous dictum, "the medium is the message", can be understood to be a consequentialist [[Meaning (philosophy of language)|theory of meaning]]. His idea was that the medium which is used to communicate carries with it information: namely, the consequences that arise from the fact that the medium has become popular. For example, one "meaning" of the light bulb might be the idea of being able to read during the night.

The controversial social psychologist and ethicist [[Thomas Szasz]] also seemed to hold this view, stating that "a word means its consequences" [http://www.szasz.com/isdepressionadiseasetranscript.html in debate].

==Meaning and cognition==
{{See also|Umwelt}}
Some non-linguistic meaning emerges from natural history as a development over vast periods of time.  This is the theory behind [[autopoiesis]] and [[self-organization]].  Some social scientists use autopoiesis as a model for the development of [https://web.archive.org/web/20060925004709/http://www.imprint.co.uk/C%26HK/vol7/gudemi.PDF structural coupling] in the family.

A typical example of this kind of relationship is the [[predator|predator-prey]] relationship.  These relations carry strong intrinsic (life and death) meaning for all living organisms, including people.

Observations of child development and of behavioral abnormalities in some people indicate that some [[nature (innate)|innate]] capabilities of human beings are essential to the process of meaning creation.  Two examples are:

* rapid [[language development]] in children, at a pace that can not be accounted for by the usual learning process.
* the functioning of a personal "''[[Theory of mind#.22Theory of Mind.22 - interpersonal understanding of mental states|theory of mind]]''" about other people, or [[empathy]], as an innate capability of most people.  (Recently published research [http://www.sciam.com/article.cfm?articleID=000B7F38-893D-152E-88E283414B7F0000&amp;sc=I100322] points to a reflex-based "''model of mind''" that is built upon the [[mirror neurons]] - that we share with certain other creatures.)

==Ideasthesia==
[[Ideasthesia]] refers to the capability of our minds to experience meaning. When concepts are activated i.e., when the meaning is extracted, the [[phenomenal consciousness|phenomenal experiences]] are affected. This tight relationship between meaning and experiences is investigated by research on ideasthesia.

'''Anne (Nancy) Flanagan''' (born 1929) is a local community worker and rights activist, living in the [[Vauxhall, Liverpool|Vauxhall area of Liverpool]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.scottiepress.org/projects/achieve.htm |title=Achievements |website=Scottiepress.org |date= |accessdate=2015-12-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Flanagan worked  to improve the health, social and living conditions within the Vauxhall area for over 40 years, starting when she became chairperson of the Vauxhall Project in 1969. Flanagan held the position for three years. In 1984 she became chairperson of the Vauxhall Neighbourhood Council and as of 2015 was still active, as well as being chairperson of the Heriot Street Residents Association.  Throughout her 50 years of public service, Flanagan did not take a salary and contributed her time voluntarily.

Flanagan was involved in the campaign to build the Vauxhall Health Centre in Limekiln Lane and other projects, like the Vauxhall Health Forum. As well as these causes, Flanagan was involved with the establishing of the Vauxhall Neighbourhood Council's day nursery, the Merseyside Accredited Childcare Training and Assessment Centre (MACTAC), VNC Lifeline and Vauxhall [[Sure Start]]. Her work was recognised in 2004, when Flanagan was awarded the [[MBE]] for her endeavours within her local community.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.liverpoolmonuments.co.uk/inaugural.htm |title=Inaugural Meeting of The Friends of Liverpool Monuments |website=Liverpoolmonuments.co.uk |date=2005-01-18 |accessdate=2015-12-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Flanagan lives alone in the home she shared with her late husband Joe Flanagan and their five children and as of 2015 is still active in local initiatives.

'''Nonviolent resistance''' ('''NVR''' or '''nonviolent action''') is the practice of achieving [[goal]]s such as social change through [[symbol]]ic [[protest]]s, [[civil disobedience]], economic or political noncooperation, [[satyagraha]], or other methods, while being [[nonviolent]]. This type of action highlights the desires of an individual or group that feels that something needs to change to improve the current condition of the resisting person or group. It is largely but wrongly taken as synonymous with [[civil resistance]]. Each of these terms—''nonviolent resistance'' and ''civil resistance''—has different connotations and commitments.

Major nonviolent resistance advocates include [[Mahatma Gandhi]], [[Henry David Thoreau]], [[Te Whiti o Rongomai]], [[Tohu Kākahi]], [[Leo Tolstoy]], [[Alice Paul]], [[Martin Luther King, Jr.|Martin Luther King, Jr]], [[Daniel Berrigan]], [[Philip Berrigan]], [[James Bevel]], [[Václav Havel]], [[Andrei Sakharov]], [[Lech Wałęsa]], [[Gene Sharp]], [[Nelson Mandela]], and many others. There are hundreds of books and papers on the subject—see [[#Further reading|Further reading]] below.

From 1966 to 1999, nonviolent civic resistance played a critical role in fifty of sixty-seven transitions from [[authoritarianism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aforcemorepowerful.org/game/index.php|title=A Force More Powerful|publisher=A Force More Powerful|date=2010-07-01|accessdate=2010-09-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; Recently, nonviolent resistance has led to the [[Rose Revolution]] in [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]] and the [[Tunisian Revolution|Jasmine Revolution]] in [[Tunisia]]. Current nonviolent resistance includes the [[Jeans Revolution]] in Belarus, the [[Black Lives Matter]] movement in the United States, and the fight of the [[Cuban dissidents]].
Many movements which promote philosophies of [[nonviolence]] or [[pacifism]] have pragmatically adopted the methods of nonviolent action as an effective way to achieve social or [[politics|political]] goals.  They employ nonviolent resistance tactics such as: [[information warfare]], [[Picketing (protest)|picketing]], [[Demonstration (protest)|marches]], [[vigil]]s, leafletting, [[samizdat]], [[magnitizdat]], [[satyagraha]], [[protest art]], [[Protest song|protest music]] and poetry, community education and [[consciousness raising]], [[lobbying]], [[tax resistance]], [[civil disobedience]], [[boycott]]s or [[Economic sanctions|sanctions]], legal/diplomatic wrestling, [[Underground Railroad|underground railroads]], principled refusal of awards/honors, and [[general strike]]s. Nonviolent action differs from pacifism by potentially being proactive and interventionist.

A great deal of work has addressed the factors that lead to violent mobilization, but less attention has been paid to understanding why disputes become violent or nonviolent, comparing these two as strategic choices relative to conventional politics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Cunningham|first1=K.

The demonstration was organized and rehearsed, with a "prohibition of all weapons of offence or defence" and exhortations to come "armed with no other weapon but that of a self-approving conscience". [[Cavalry]] charged into the crowd, with [[sabre]]s drawn, and in the ensuing confusion, 15 people were killed and 400–700 were injured. Newspapers expressed horror, and [[Percy Shelley]] glorified nonviolent resistance in the poem [[The Masque of Anarchy]].

| In the failed [[Hungarian Revolution of 1848]], the Hungarians tried to regain independence, and were defeated by the Austrian Empire only with the aid of the [[Russian Empire]]. After 1848, the empire instituted several constitutional reforms, trying to resolve the problem, but without success. The resistance was instrumental in keeping up hope and spirit in a Hungary fully incorporated into Austria and characterized by reprisals against political dissidents, thousands of treason trials, military governance, centralization, absolutism, censorship and direct control of Vienna over every aspect of public life. Their followers carefully avoided any political agitation or criticism of the establishment, and strictly concentrated on national issues of non-political nature, such as the use of the [[Hungarian language]], development of the Hungarian economy, and protection of the legal standing of the [[Hungarian Academy of Sciences]].

I shall bury my patu in the earth and it shall not rise again ... Waikato, lie down. Do not allow blood to flow from this time on." This was inspirational to Waikato Māori who refused to fight in [[World War I]]. In response, the [[New Zealand Government|government]] brought in [[conscription]] for the Tainui-Waikato people (other Māori [[iwi]] were exempt) but they continued to resist, the majority of conscripts choosing to suffer harsh military punishments rather than join the army. For the duration of the war, no Tainui soldiers were sent overseas.

|[[Palestinian non-violent resistance]]
|[[Peace camp]]s and strategic non-violent resistance to Israeli construction of [[Israeli settlement|Jewish settlements]] and of the [[Israeli West Bank Barrier|West Bank Barrier]] have been adopted as tactics by Palestinians as part of the [[Israeli–Palestinian conflict]]. For example, citizens of the Palestinian village of [[Beit Sahour]] engaged in a tax strike during the First Intifada.

In 2010, A "White Intifada" took hold in the West Bank, including East Jerusalem. Activities included weekly peaceful protests by Palestinian activists accompanied by Israeli human rights organization [[B'Tselem]] and Israeli academics and students against settlers and security forces. The EU, through its foreign policy chief [[Catherine Ashton]] has criticised Israel for convicting an organiser of the peaceful movement and said that she was deeply concerned about the arrest of Abdullah Abu Rahmeh. There have been two fatalities among protesters and an American peace activist suffered brain damage after being hit by a tear gas canister.

|A tense standoff and potential riot between Hundreds of LAPD riot gear-laden police officers, who were determined to quell the swelling crowds that exceeded four hundred homosexual citizens, was averted after a last minute plea from then new Governor [[Ronald Reagan]], via an openly gay Republican Judicial Appointee who acted as a personal envoy of the Governor to LAPD Commanders at the site of the standoff, was accepted, and a stand down order given which ordered the hundreds of [[LAPD]] officers present to cease and desist from further unprovoked harassment of homosexuals in Los Angeles for decades.  The plea was successfully communicated and accepted by the LAPD hierarchy, and represented the first time that a stand down order was given by the LAPD, and was the last time until 2001, that the [[Los Angeles Police Department]] would engage in raiding an establishment, or public assembly of homosexuals in Los Angeles for decades.

Security forces responded with a harsh crackdown, arresting thousands of dissidents and killing hundreds of protesters.  Peaceful protests were largely crushed by the army or subsided as rebels and [[Islamism|Islamist]] fighters took up arms against the government, leading to a full-blown rebellion against the Assad regime.

|[[Bahraini uprising (2011–present)]]
|Inspired by the regional [[Arab Spring]], protests started in Bahrain on [[Day of Rage (Bahrain)|14 February]]. The government responded harshly, [[Bloody Thursday (2011)|killing]] four protesters camping in [[Pearl Roundabout]]. Later, protesters were allowed to reoccupy the roundabout where they staged [[March of loyalty to martyrs|large marches]] amounting to 150,000 participants.

On 14 March, [[Saudi]]-led [[Peninsula Shield|GCC forces]] were requested by the government and entered the country, which the opposition called an "occupation". The following day, a [[state of emergency]] was declared and protests paused after a brutal crackdown was launched against protesters, including doctors and bloggers. Nearly 3,000 people have been arrested, and at least five people died due to torture while in police custody.

Protests resumed after lifting emergency law on 1 June, and several large rallies were staged by the opposition parties, including a march on 9 March 2012 attended by over 100,000. Smaller-scale protests and clashes outside of the capital have continued to occur almost daily. More than 80 people had died since the start of the uprising.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="17790">The '''obstetrical dilemma''' is a hypothesis to explain why humans often require assistance from other humans during [[childbirth]] to avoid complications, whereas most non-human primates give birth alone with relatively little difficulty. The obstetrical dilemma posits that this is due to the biological [[trade-off]] imposed by two opposing [[evolutionary pressure]]s in the development of the human [[pelvis]]. As human ancestor species (hominids) developed bipedal locomotion (the ability to walk upright), decreasing the size of the bony birth canal, they also developed ever larger [[skull]]s&lt;nowiki/&gt;, which required a wider obstetrical pelvic area to accommodate this trend in hominid infants.&lt;nowiki/&gt;&lt;ref name=evolutionaryorigins&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Wittman | first1 = A.

== History ==
The term, obstetrical dilemma, was coined in 1960, by Sherwood Lerned Washburn ([[Sherwood Washburn|SL Washburn]]), a prominent early American physical anthropologist, in order to describe the evolutionary development of the human pelvis and its relation to childbirth and pregnancy in hominids and non-human primates.&lt;ref name="roulette"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Wells | first1 = J. C. K. | last2 = Desilva | first2 = J. M. | last3 = Stock | first3 = J. T. | year = 2012 | title = The obstetric dilemma: An ancient game of Russian roulette, or a variable dilemma sensitive to ecology? | url = | journal = American Journal of Physical Anthropology | volume = 149 | issue = | pages = 40–71 | pmid = 23138755 | doi=10.1002/ajpa.22160}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the intervening decades, the term has been used broadly among anthropologists, biologists, and other scientists to describe aspects of this hypothesis and related topics.

This comparison is one of the pieces of evidence physical anthropologists use to support the Obstetrical Dilemma hypothesis]]

=== Human pelvis ===
The obstetrical dilemma hypothesizes that when hominids began to develop bipedal locomotion, the conflict between these two opposing evolutionary pressures became greatly exacerbated. Because humans are currently the only recognized extant obligately bipedal primates, meaning our body shape requires to only use two legs, major evolutionary developments had to occur in order to alter to the shape of the female pelvis.&lt;ref name="evolutionaryorigins" /&gt; Human males evolved narrower hips optimized for locomotion, whereas female hips evolved to be a wider optimization because of childbirthing needs.&lt;ref name="roulette" /&gt;&lt;ref name="bipedalism"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Rosenberg | first1 = K. | last2 = Trevathan | first2 = W. | year = 2005 | title = Bipedalism and human birth: The obstetrical dilemma revisited | url = | journal = Evolutionary Anthropology | volume = 4 | issue = 5| pages = 161–168 | doi = 10.1002/evan.1360040506 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/science/2013/jun/30/childbirth-metabolic-rate-obstetric-dilemma "Why must childbirth be such hard labour?   New evidence about why women give birth when they do has turned received opinion on its head by Alice Roberts, 2013-06-30"].&lt;/ref&gt; Human pelvises have no distinguishing skeletal markers for sex before puberty, meanwhile, with maturation, hormones and obstetrical demands alter the shape of the pelvis in females. Overall, through evolution of the species, a number of structures in the body have changed size, proportion, or location in order to accommodate bipedal locomotion and allow a person to stand upright and face forward. To help support the upper body, a number of structural changes were made to the pelvis. The ilial pelvic bone shifted forward and broadened, while the ischial pelvic bone shrank, narrowing the pelvic canal. These changes were occurring at the same time as humans were developing larger craniums.

=== Adaptations to ensure live birth ===
Early human ancestors, hominids, originally gave birth in a similar way that non-human primates do because early obligate quadrupedal individuals would have retained similar skeletal structure to great apes. Most non-human primates today have neonatal heads that are close in size to the mother’s birth canal, as evidenced by observing female primates who do not need assistance in birthing, often seeking seclusion away from others of their species.&lt;ref name="allomaternalcare"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Isler | first1 = Karin | last2 = van Schaik | first2 = Caret | year = 2012 | title = Allomaternal care, life history, and brain size evolution in mammals | url = | journal = Journal of Human Evolution | volume = 63 | issue = | pages = 52–63 | doi = 10.1097/01.ogx.0000286584.04310.5c }}&lt;/ref&gt; In modern humans, [[Birth|parturition]] (childbirth) differs greatly from the rest of the primates because of both pelvic shape of the mother and neonatal shape of the infant. Further adaptations evolved to cope with bipedalism and larger craniums were also important such as neonatal rotation of the infant, shorter gestation length, assistance with birth, and a malleable neonatal head.


==== Neonatal rotation ====
During delivery neonatal rotation occurs when the body gets rotated to align head and shoulders transversely when entering the small pelvis (internal rotation) and then longitudinally to exit the birth canal (external rotation). This is an important mechanism because growth in the size of the cranium as well as the width of the shoulders makes it more difficult for the infant to fit through the pelvis.&lt;ref name="evolutionaryorigins" /&gt; This differs in non-human primates as there is no need for neonatal rotation in non-human primates because the birth canal is wide enough to accommodate the infant.&lt;ref name="rosenberg"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Rosenberg | first1 = Karen | last2 = Trevathan | first2 = Wenda | year = 2003 | title = Birth, obstetrics and human evolution| journal = BJOG| volume = 109 | issue = 11| pages = 1199–1206 | doi = 10.1046/j.1471-0528.2002.00010.x | pmid = 12452455 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Gestation length and altriciality ====
Gestation length in humans is shorter than most other primates. It is thought that this shorter gestation period is an adaptation to ensure the survival of mother and child because it leads to [[altricial]]ity. The obstetrical dilemma hypothesis suggests that in order to successfully undergo childbirth, the infant must be born earlier and earlier, thereby making the child increasingly developmentally premature.&lt;ref name="dunsworth"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Dunsworth | first1 = H. M. | last2 = Warrener | first2 = A. G. | last3 = Deacon | first3 = T. | last4 = Ellison | first4 = P. T. | last5 = Pontzer | first5 = H. | year = 2012 | title = Metabolic hypothesis for human altriciality | journal = Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences | volume = 109 | issue = 38| pages = 15212–15216 | doi = 10.1073/pnas.1205282109 | pmid = 22932870 | pmc=3458333}}&lt;/ref&gt; The concept of the infant being born underdeveloped is called [[altricial|altriciality]]. Humans are born with an underdeveloped brain; only 25% of their brains fully developed at birth as opposed to non-human primates where the infant is born with 45–50% brain development.&lt;ref&gt;Trevathan, Wenda (2011). Human Birth: An Evolutionary Perspective. Aldine Transaction. {{ISBN|1-4128-1502-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;


==== Social assistance ====
Human infants are also almost always born with assistance from other humans because of the way that the pelvis is shaped. Since the pelvis and opening of birth canal face backwards, humans have difficulty giving birth themselves because they cannot guide the baby out of the canal. Non-human primates seek seclusion when giving birth because they do not need any help due to the pelvis and opening being more forward.&lt;ref name="rosenberg" /&gt; Human infants depend on their parents much more and for much longer than other primates.&lt;ref name="bipedalism" /&gt;&lt;ref name="dunsworth" /&gt; Humans spend a lot of their time caring for their children as they develop whereas other species stand on their own from when they are born. The faster an infant develops, the higher the reproductive output of a female can be.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Garber | first1 = P.A. | last2 = Leigh | first2 = S.R. | year = 1997 | title = Ontogenetic variation in small-bodied new world primates | url = | journal = Folia Primatologica | volume = 68 | issue = | pages = 1–22 | doi = 10.1159/000157226 | pmid = 9170641 }}&lt;/ref&gt; So in humans, the cost of slow development of their infants is that humans reproduce relatively slowly. This phenomenon is also known as [[cooperative breeding]].

==== Malleable cranium ====
Humans are born with a very malleable fetal head which is not fully developed when the infant exits the womb.&lt;ref name="evolutionaryorigins" /&gt; This soft spot on the crown of the infant allows for the head to be compressed in order to better fit through the birth canal without obstructing it.&lt;ref name="bipedalism" /&gt; This allows for the head to develop more after birth and for the cranium to continue growing without affecting the birthing process.

==Challenges to the obstetrical dilemma hypothesis==

The obstetrical dilemma hypothesis has had several challenges to it, as more data is collected and analysized. Several different fields of study have taken an interest in understanding more about the human birth process and that of human ancestor species.

=== Early brain growth rates ===

Some studies have shown that higher brain growth rates happen earlier on in [[ontogeny]] than previously thought,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = de Leon | first1 = Ponce | last2 = Marcia | first2 =  | display-authors = 2 | last3 = et al | year = 2008 | title = Neanderthal brain size at birth proves insights into the evolution of human life history | journal = PNAS | volume = 105 | issue = | pages = 13764–13768 | pmid = 18779579 | doi=10.1073/pnas.0803917105 | pmc=2533682}}&lt;/ref&gt; which challenges the idea that the explanation of the obstetrical dilemma is that humans are born with underdeveloped brains. This is because if brain growth rates were largest in early development, that is when the brain size would increase the most. Premature birth would not allow for a much larger head size if most of the growth had already happened. Also, it has been suggested that maternal pelvic dimensions are sensitive to some ecological factors.

=== Maternal heat stress ===

There has been a lot of evidence linking body mass to brain mass and determining maternal metabolism as a key factor in the growth of the fetus. Maternal constraints could be largely due to thermal stress or energy available. A larger brain mass in the neonate corresponds to more energy needed to sustain it. It takes much more energy for the mother if the brain fully develops in the womb. If maternal energy is the limiting factor then an infant can only grow as much as the mother can sustain. Also, because fetal size is positively correlated to maternal energy use, thermal stress is an issue because the larger the fetus the more the mother can suffer heat stress.&lt;ref name="roulette" /&gt;

=== Environmental effects ===

Additional studies suggest that other factors may further complicate the obstetrical dilemma hypothesis. One of these is dietary shifts, possibly due to the emergence of agriculture. This can be both due to change in diet as well as the increase in population density since agriculture was developed; more people leads to more disease.&lt;ref name="roulette" /&gt; Studies have also been done in twins to show that pelvic size may be due more to the environment in which they live than their genetics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Sharma | first1 = Krishan | year = 2002 | title = Genetic basis of human female pelvic morphology: A twin study | url = | journal = American Journal of Physical Anthropology | volume = 117 | issue = | pages = 327–333 | pmid = 11920368 | doi=10.1002/ajpa.10055}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another study disproves the thought that narrower hips are optimized for locomotion because it was found that a Late Stone Age population Southern Africa that survived largely on terrestrial mobility had women who had uncharacteristically small body size with large pelvic canals.&lt;ref name="roulette" /&gt;

=== Hormones ===
Moreover, the pelvis has the most favorable morphology for obstetrics between ages 25 and 30. Given that those are the ages of highest fertility, it may indicate that sex-biased autosomal gene expression, regulated by sex-specific hormones and sensitivity of hormone receptors, may obstruct the birth outside of that age range.

=== Energetics of gestation and growth hypothesis ===

The energetics of gestation and growth (EGG) hypothesis offers a direct challenge to the obstetrical dilemma hypothesis, equating the constraints on gestation and parturition to the energy restrictions of the mother. It has been shown that using both professional athletes and pregnant women, there is an upper limitation to the amount of energy a woman can produce before it cause deleterious effects: approximately 2.1x their basal metabolic rate. During pregnancy the growing brain mass and length in the neonate correspond to more energy needed to sustain it. This results in a competing balance between the fetus’s demand for energy and the maternal ability to meet that demand. At approximately 9 months gestation, the fetus’s energy needs surpasses the mother’s energy limitation, correlating with the average time of birth.&lt;ref name="dunsworth" /&gt; The newly born infant can then be sustained on breast milk, which is a more efficient, less energy demanding mechanism of nutrient transfer between mother and child.&lt;ref name="kane"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Kane | first1 = Sunanda V. | last2 = Acquah | first2 = Letitia A. | year = 2009 | title = Placenta transport of Immunoglobulins: A Clinical Review for Gastroenterologist Who Prescribe Therapeutic Monoclonal Antibodies to Women During Conception and Pregnancy | url = | journal = The American Journal of Gastroenterology | volume = 104 | issue = 1| pages = 228–33 | pmid = 19098873 | doi=10.1038/ajg.2008.71}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, this hypothesis demonstrates that, contrary to the obstetrical dilemma, an increased pelvic size would not be deleterious to bipedalism. Studying the running mechanics of males and females, it was shown that an increased pelvic size related to neither an increased metabolic nor structural demand on a woman.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Warrener|first=Lisa|last2=Lewton|first2=Kristi L.|last3=Pontzer|first3=Herman|last4=Lieberman|first4=Daniel E.|date=March 1, 2015|title=A Wider Pelvis Does Not Increase Locomotor Cost in Humans, with Implications for the Evolution of Childbirth|url=http://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&amp;db=a9h&amp;AN=101839944&amp;site=eds-live|journal=PLOS ONE|volume=|issue=|doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0118903 |pmid=|access-date=July 19, 2016|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Obstetrical dilemma revisited ===
The obstetrical dilemma hypothesis has also been challenged conceptually based on new studies. The authors argue that the obstetrical dilemma hypothesis assumes that human, and therefore hominid, childbirth has been a painful and dangerous experience through the species' evolution.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Stone|first=Pamela K.|date=January 25, 2016|title=Biocultural Perspectives on Maternal Mortality and Obstetrical Death From the Past to the Present|doi=10.1002/ajpa.22906|journal=American Journal of Physical Anthropology|volume=159|issue=S61|pmid=26808103|pages=150–171}}&lt;/ref&gt; This assumption may be fundamentally false as many early analyses focused on maternal death data from primarily females of European-descent in Western Europe and the United States during the 19th and 20th century, a limited population in a time of great change. The study suggests the increase in maternal mortality during this time period was not due to evolutionary limitations as the creators of the obstetrical dilemma hypothesis thought, but due to the increased use of medical intervention, the medicalization of pregnancy and childbirth and restrictive socio-cultural practices of the [[Victorian era|Victorian]] era.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; In a recent study a covariation between human pelvis shape, stature, and head size is reported. It is said that females with a large head possess a birth canal that can better accommodate large-headed neonates. Mothers with large heads usually give birth to neonates with large heads. Therefore, the detected pattern of covariation contributes to ease childbirth and has likely evolved in response to strong correlational selection.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Fischer | first1 = Barbara | last2 = Mitteroecker | first2 = Philipp | year = 2015 | title = Covariation between human pelvis shape, stature, and head size alleviates the obstetric dilemma | url = http://www.pnas.org/content/112/18/5655.full.pdf | format = PDF | journal = PNAS | volume = 112 | issue = 18| pages = 5655–5660 | doi=10.1073/pnas.1420325112| pmc = 4426453 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Paul Samuel Henderson''' (October 10, 1899 &amp;ndash; May 24, 1988) was an African-American photojournalist for the ''[[Baltimore Afro-American]]'' newspaper from 1929 through circa 1960.&lt;ref&gt;Other 6 -- no title. (1966, Jan 22). Afro-American (1893-1988). Retrieved from http://search.proquest.com/docview/532275068&lt;/ref&gt; He became well known for taking pictures of large groups and distant objects atop a ladder he carried.&lt;ref&gt;Paul S. Henderson Was Photographer [Obituary]. (1988, May 29). The Baltimore Sun.&lt;/ref&gt; Henderson primarily photographed people, including church groups, politicians, graduations, local college and university groups, weddings, events during the [[Civil Rights Movement]], and more. He was a member of the [[National Association for the Advancement of Colored People]], a vestryman at St. James Church, charter member of the Druid Hill Avenue Neighborhood Club, assistant treasurer of a local Frontiers International club, and supported [[The Salvation Army]].&lt;ref&gt;Paul S. Henderson Was Photographer [Obituary]. (1988, May 29). The Baltimore Sun.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Early life ==
Paul Samuel Henderson was born on October 10, 1899 in Springfield, Tennessee and was the youngest of four children born to Ike A. and Annie L. Henderson. At age 18 he registered for the World War I draft on September 12, 1918 while working as a bricklayer for a steel company in Gary, Indiana. In 1920 his profession changed to driver for a laundry in Gary. At some point during his residence in Gary, he attended the School for Professional Photography.&lt;ref&gt;Registration State: Indiana; Registration County: Lake; Roll: 1503889; Draft Board: 2.

== Photography career ==
After leaving Indiana, Henderson worked for a newspaper in Roanoke, Virginia.&lt;ref&gt;Registration State: Indiana; Registration County: Lake; Roll: 1503889; Draft Board: 2. Ancestry.com. U.S., World War I Draft Registration Cards, 1917-1918 [database on-line]. Provo, UT, USA: Ancestry.com Operations Inc, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; Henderson moved to Baltimore in 1929 and became what the ''[[Baltimore Afro-American]]'' newspaper called their first photographer.&lt;ref&gt;Other 6 -- no title. (1966, Jan 22). Afro-American (1893-1988). Retrieved from http://search.proquest.com/docview/532275068&lt;/ref&gt; Henderson used a large format [[view camera]] to produce glass negatives, and eight by ten inch and four by five inch acetate negatives.

Henderson documented racial segregation and early civil rights protests as well as community members of the Baltimore City's African-American population. Henderson photographed [[National Association for the Advancement of Colored People]] Baltimore Branch president [[Lillie Mae Carroll Jackson]], Baltimore City Mayor and Maryland State Governor [[Theodore McKeldin]], Supreme Court Justice [[Thurgood Marshall]] when he was a lawyer for the NAACP, journalist and publisher [[Carl Murphy]], businesses and people along Pennsylvania Avenue, which was once a main artery for black culture and life in Baltimore and much more.&lt;ref&gt;Kelly, J. (2012, Feb 23). Md. Historical Society wants to identify subjects of Civil Rights era photos. The Baltimore Sun.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Photograph collection ===
Henderson bequeathed his photograph and object collection to the [[Peale Museum]]. When the Peale closed its doors in 1997, the collection was transferred to the [[Maryland Historical Society]].&lt;ref&gt;Kelly, J. (2012, Feb 23). Md. Historical Society wants to identify subjects of Civil Rights era photos. The Baltimore Sun.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Personal life ==
In 1930, Henderson married schoolteacher and “prominent society girl” Elizabeth Johnson. Mrs. Henderson was a graduate of Douglass High School and Coppin Normal School for Teachers (now Coppin State University) in Baltimore whose career flourished in the Baltimore City Public School system.&lt;ref&gt;Miss Elizabeth Johnson Will Marry Saturday (1930, Sep 27). [Society] Afro-American, A13.&lt;/ref&gt; Paul and Elizabeth Henderson had no children.

In 1966 Henderson became so gravely ill that on January 22, the Baltimore Afro-American printed a premature obituary for him.&lt;ref&gt;Obituary 1 -- no title. (1966, Jan 22). Afro-American (1893-1988). Retrieved from http://search.proquest.com/docview/532147005&lt;/ref&gt; However, in the same issue, the newspaper asks readers for prayers for Henderson who had been in Hopkins Hospital for the past week. In April 1966, the newspaper’s Bettye M. Moss updates readers in her column about Henderson’s condition, stating that he is able to be “up and about” at the Bolton Hill Nursing Home at Lafayette Avenue and John Street in Baltimore.&lt;ref&gt;Moss, B. (1966, Apr 16). If you ask me. Afro-American (1893-1988). Retrieved from http://search.proquest.com/docview/532183939&lt;/ref&gt; By June the Afro-American reports that Henderson is back at home at 1925 Druid Hill Avenue in Baltimore.

Henderson died on Tuesday, May 24, 1988, at Union Memorial Hospital after a reported battle with an illness. Services were held at St. James Episcopal Church at Lafayette and Arlington avenues. He had outlived his wife Elizabeth, who died in 1982.&lt;ref&gt;Paul S. Henderson Was Photographer [Obituary]. (1988, May 29). The Baltimore Sun.&lt;/ref&gt; His obituary stated that he was survived by his brother, Willard Henderson, who lived in Tampa, Florida.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2452">A '''peaceworker''' is an individual or member of an organization that undertakes to resolve violent conflict, prevent the rise of new violent conflicts, and rebuild societies damaged by war.

The term peaceworker is usually reserved for civilian, unarmed members of [[non-governmental organizations]]. Peacework is also carried out by many armed organizations such as the [[UN]], but armed personnel are seldom called peaceworkers.

== Peacework ==
Peaceworker duties include the following:
* Bringing conflicting parties together, opening channels of communication and helping to broker a ceasefire or peace agreement
* Monitoring voting booths, providing technical expertise and other forms of support in order to help ensure a free and fair electioneering environment
* Providing protective accompaniment of people at risk, monitoring borders and other actions for stabilizing preserve ceasefire agreements and preserving human life
* Reintegrating ex-combatants into society
* Promoting a respect for human rights within the local and national legal system, strengthening local institutions and civil society organizations that defend human rights

== Peaceworker Training ==
Peaceworker training and guidance is provided by organizations such as [[International Alert]]. University-provided [[Peace and conflict studies]] courses also provide valuable and relevant knowledge. As peace work can utilize a very wide variety of skills, it allows those with established, unrelated careers to take up peace work without having to abandon what they have already learned.

== Peaceworker organizations ==
Any organization dedicated to human rights, humanitarian aid and conflict management could be said to employ peace workers. The following is just a small sample of the dozens of organizations worldwide that provide these services.
* [[Nonviolent Peaceforce]]
* International Alert
* [[Peace Brigades International]]
* [[Christian Peacemaker Teams]]

The '''periodic table of topological invariants''' is an application of [[topology]] to [[physics]]. It indicates the group of topological invariant for [[topological insulator]]s and [[superconductor]]s in each dimension and in each discrete symmetry class.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal| doi = 10.1103/RevModPhys.88.035005 | last = Chiu| first = C. |author2=J. Teo|author3=A. Schnyder |author4=S. Ryu  | title = Classification of topological quantum matter with symmetries| journal = Rev. Mod. Phys.| volume = 88 | issue = 035005 | year = 2016 | arxiv = 1505.03535| bibcode = 2016RvMP...88c5005C}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Discrete symmetry classes==

There are ten discrete symmetry classes of topological insulators and superconductors, corresponding to the ten Altland–Zirnbauer classes of [[random matrix|random matrices]]. They are defined by three symmetries of the Hamiltonian &lt;math&gt;\hat{H} = \sum_{i,j} H_{ij} c_i^{\dagger} c_j&lt;/math&gt;, (where &lt;math&gt;c_i&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;c_i^{\dagger}&lt;/math&gt;, are the annihilation and creation operators of mode &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt;, in some arbitrary spatial basis) : time reversal symmetry, particle hole (or charge conjugation) symmetry, and chiral (or sublattice) symmetry.

Chiral symmetry is a unitary operator &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt;, that acts on &lt;math&gt;c_i&lt;/math&gt;, as a unitary rotation (&lt;math&gt;S c_i S^{-1} = (U_S)_{ij} c_j&lt;/math&gt;,) and satisfies &lt;math&gt;S^2 = 1&lt;/math&gt;,. A Hamiltonian &lt;math&gt;H&lt;/math&gt; possesses chiral symmetry when &lt;math&gt; S\hat{H}S^{-1}=-\hat{H}&lt;/math&gt;, for some choice of &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt; (on the level of first-quantised Hamiltonians, this means &lt;math&gt;U_S&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;H&lt;/math&gt; are anticommuting matrices).

Time reversal is an antiunitary operator &lt;math&gt;T&lt;/math&gt;, that acts on &lt;math&gt;\alpha c_i&lt;/math&gt;, (where &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt;, is an arbitrary complex coefficient, and &lt;math&gt;^*&lt;/math&gt;, denotes complex conjugation) as &lt;math&gt;T \alpha c_i T^{-1} = \alpha^* {(U_T)}_{ij}c_j&lt;/math&gt;,. It can be written as &lt;math&gt;T = U_T \mathcal{K}&lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{K}&lt;/math&gt; is the complex conjugation operator and &lt;math&gt;U_T&lt;/math&gt; is a unitary matrix. Either &lt;math&gt;T^2 = 1&lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt;T^2 = -1&lt;/math&gt;. A Hamiltonian with time reversal symmetry satisfies &lt;math&gt;T\hat{H}T^{-1} = \hat{H}&lt;/math&gt;, or on the level of first-quantised matrices, &lt;math&gt;U_T H^* U_T^{-1} = H&lt;/math&gt;, for some choice of &lt;math&gt;U_T&lt;/math&gt;.

Charge conjugation &lt;math&gt;C&lt;/math&gt; is also an antiunitary operator which acts on &lt;math&gt;\alpha c_i&lt;/math&gt; as &lt;math&gt;C \alpha c_i C^{-1}  = \alpha^* (U_C^{\dagger})_{ji}c_j&lt;/math&gt;, and can be written as &lt;math&gt;C = U_C \mathcal{K}&lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt;U_C&lt;/math&gt; is unitary. Again either &lt;math&gt;C^2 =1&lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt;C^2 = -1&lt;/math&gt; depending on what &lt;math&gt;U_C&lt;/math&gt; is. A Hamiltonian with particle hole symmetry satisfies &lt;math&gt;C\hat{H}C^{-1} = - \hat{H}&lt;/math&gt;, or on the level of first-quantised Hamiltonian matrices, &lt;math&gt;U_C H^* U_C^{-1} = - H&lt;/math&gt;, for some choice of &lt;math&gt;U_C&lt;/math&gt;.

In the Bloch Hamiltonian formalism for periodic crystals, where the Hamiltonian &lt;math&gt;H(k)&lt;/math&gt; acts on modes of crystal momentum &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt;, the chiral symmetry, TRS, and PHS conditions become &lt;math&gt;U_S H(k) U_S^{-1} = -H(k)&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;U_T H(k)^* U_T^{-1} = H(-k)&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;U_C H(k)^* U_C^{-1} = -H(-k)&lt;/math&gt;.

It is evident that if two of these three symmetries are present, then the third is also present, due to the relation &lt;math&gt;S= TC&lt;/math&gt;.

The aforementioned discrete symmetries label 10 distinct discrete symmetry classes, which coincide with the Altland–Zirnbauer classes of random matrices.

==Equivalence classes of Hamiltonians==

A bulk Hamiltonian in a particular symmetry group is restricted to be a Hermitian matrix with no zero-energy eigenvalues (i.e. so that the spectrum is "gapped" and the system is a bulk insulator) satisfying the symmetry constraints of the group. In the case of &lt;math&gt;d&gt;0&lt;/math&gt; dimensions, this Hamiltonian is a continuous  function &lt;math&gt;H(k)&lt;/math&gt; of the &lt;math&gt;d&lt;/math&gt; parameters in the Bloch momentum vector &lt;math&gt; \vec{k}&lt;/math&gt; in the  [[Brillouin zone]]; then the symmetry constraints must hold for all &lt;math&gt;\vec{k}&lt;/math&gt;.

Given two Hamiltonians &lt;math&gt;H_1&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;H_2&lt;/math&gt;, it may be possible to continuously deform &lt;math&gt;H_1&lt;/math&gt; into &lt;math&gt;H_2&lt;/math&gt; while maintaining the symmetry constraint and gap (that is, there exists continuous function &lt;math&gt;H(t, \vec{k})&lt;/math&gt; such that for all &lt;math&gt;0 \le t \le 1&lt;/math&gt; the Hamiltonian has no zero eigenvalue and symmetry condition is maintained, and &lt;math&gt;H(0, \vec{k} ) = H_1( \vec{k})&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;H(1, \vec{k} ) = H_2( \vec{k})&lt;/math&gt;). Then we say that &lt;math&gt;H_1&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;H_2&lt;/math&gt; are equivalent.

However, it may also turn out that there is no such continuous deformation. in this case, physically if two materials with bulk Hamiltonians &lt;math&gt;H_1&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;H_2&lt;/math&gt; respectively neighbour each other with an edge between them, when one continuously moves across the edge one must encounter a zero eigenvalue (as there is no continuous transformation that avoids this). This may manifest as a gapless zero energy edge mode or an electric current that only flows along the edge.

An interesting question is to ask, given a symmetry class and a dimension of the Brillouin zone, what are all the equivalence classes of Hamiltonians. Each equivalence class can be labeled by a topological invariant; two Hamiltonians whose topological invariant are different cannot be deformed into each other and belong to different equivalence classes.

== Classifying spaces of Hamiltonians ==

For each of the symmetry classes, the question can be simplified by deforming the Hamiltonian into a "projective" Hamiltonian, and considering the symmetric space in which such Hamiltonians live. These classifying spaces are shown for each symmetry class:&lt;ref&gt;[[Alexei Kitaev|Kitaev, Alexei]].

&lt;/math&gt;
|-
|CI
|&lt;math&gt;U(N)/O(N)&lt;/math&gt;
|&lt;math&gt;0
&lt;/math&gt;
|}
For example, a (real symmetric) Hamiltonian in symmetry class AI can have its &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; positive eigenvalues deformed to +1 and its &lt;math&gt;N-n&lt;/math&gt; negative eigenvalues deformed to -1; the resulting such matrices are described by the union of real [[Grassmannians]] &lt;math&gt;\bigcup_{n=0}^\infty Gr(n, N) = \bigcup_{n=0}^\infty O(N)/O(n)\times O(N-n)&lt;/math&gt;

The strong topological invariants of a many-band system in &lt;math&gt;d&lt;/math&gt; dimensions can be labeled by the elements of the &lt;math&gt;d&lt;/math&gt;-th homotopy group of the symmetric space. These groups are displayed in this table, called the periodic table of topological insulators:

There may also exist weak topological invariants (associated to the fact that the suspension of the Brillouin zone is in fact equivalent to a &lt;math&gt;d+1&lt;/math&gt; sphere wedged with lower-dimensional spheres), which are not included in this table. Furthermore, the table assumes the limit of an infinite number of bands, i.e. involves &lt;math&gt;N \times N&lt;/math&gt; Hamiltonians for &lt;math&gt;N \to \infty&lt;/math&gt;.

The table also is [[Bott periodicity theorem|periodic]] in the sense that the group of invariants in &lt;math&gt;d&lt;/math&gt; dimensions is the same as the group of invariants in &lt;math&gt;d+8&lt;/math&gt; dimensions. In the case of no antiunitary symmetries, the invariant groups are periodic in dimension by 2.

For nontrivial symmetry classes, the actual invariant can be defined by one of the following integrals over all or part of the Brillouin zone: the [[Berry connection and curvature|Chern number]], the Wess Zumino winding number, the Chern–Simons invariant, the Fu–Kane invariant.

==Dimensional reduction and Bott Clock==

The periodic table also displays a peculiar property: the invariant groups in &lt;math&gt;d&lt;/math&gt; dimensions are identical to those in &lt;math&gt;d-1&lt;/math&gt; dimensions but in a different symmetry class. Among the complex symmetry classes, the invariant group for A in &lt;math&gt;d&lt;/math&gt; dimensions is the same as that for AIII in &lt;math&gt;d-1&lt;/math&gt; dimensions, and vice versa. One can also imagine arranging each of the eight real symmetry classes on the Cartesian plane such that the &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; coordinate is &lt;math&gt;T^2&lt;/math&gt; if time reversal symmetry is present and &lt;math&gt;0&lt;/math&gt; if it is absent, and the &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt; coordinate is &lt;math&gt;C^2&lt;/math&gt; if particle hole symmetry is present and &lt;math&gt;0&lt;/math&gt; if it is absent. Then the invariant group in &lt;math&gt;d&lt;/math&gt; dimensions for a certain real symmetry class is the same as the invariant group in &lt;math&gt;d-1&lt;/math&gt; dimensions for the symmetry class directly one space clockwise. This phenomenon was termed the "Bott Clock" by [[Alexei Kitaev|Kitaev]], in reference to the [[Bott periodicity theorem]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://topocondmat.org/w8_general/classification.html|title=General approach to topological classification|last=Ryu|first=Shinsei|date=|work=Topology in Condensed Matter|access-date=2018-04-30|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Bott Clock can be understood by considering the problem of [[Clifford algebra]] extensions.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Near an interface between two inequivalent bulk materials, the Hamiltonian approaches a gap closing. To lowest order expansion in momentum slightly away from the gap closing, the Hamiltonian takes the form of a Dirac Hamiltonian &lt;math&gt;H_\text{Dirac}(\vec{k}) = \sum_{j=1}^d \Gamma_j v_j k_j + m\Gamma_0 &lt;/math&gt;. Here, &lt;math&gt;\Gamma_1, \Gamma_2, \ldots, \Gamma_d&lt;/math&gt; are a representation of the Clifford Algebra &lt;math&gt;\lbrace \Gamma_i , \Gamma_j \rbrace = 2\delta_{ij}&lt;/math&gt;, while &lt;math&gt;m\Gamma_0&lt;/math&gt; is an added "mass term" that and anticommutes with the rest of the Hamiltonian and vanishes at the interface (thus giving the interface a gapless edge mode at &lt;math&gt;k=0&lt;/math&gt;). The &lt;math&gt;m\Gamma_0&lt;/math&gt; term for the Hamiltonian on one side of the interface cannot be continuously deformed into the &lt;math&gt;m\Gamma_0&lt;/math&gt; term for the Hamiltonian on the other side of the interface. Thus (letting &lt;math&gt;m&lt;/math&gt; be an arbitrary positive scalar) the problem of classifying topological invariants reduces to the problem of classifying all possible inequivalent choices of &lt;math&gt;\Gamma_0&lt;/math&gt; to extend the Clifford algebra to one higher dimension, while maintaining the symmetry constraints.

[[wiktionary:post-truth|Post-truth]] differs from traditional contesting and falsifying of facts by relegating facts and expert opinions to be of secondary importance relative to appeal to emotion. While this has been described as a contemporary problem, some observers have described it as a long-standing part of political life that was less notable before the advent of the [[Internet]] and related social changes.

{{As of|2018}} political commentators have identified post-truth politics as ascendant in many nations, notably the United States, India, the United Kingdom, Russia, and Brazil, among others. As with other areas of debate, this is being driven by a combination of the [[24-hour news cycle]], [[false balance]] in news reporting, and the increasing ubiquity of [[social media]].&lt;ref name=economist-10-9-16&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.economist.com/news/briefing/21706498-dishonesty-politics-nothing-new-manner-which-some-politicians-now-lie-and |title="The post-truth world: Yes, I’d lie to you," '&amp;#39;The Economist'&amp;#39; Sept 10, 2016 |publisher=Economist.com |date=2016-09-10 |accessdate=2018-03-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Age-abbott"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.theage.com.au/comment/tony-abbotts-carbon-tax-outrage-signals-nadir-of-posttruth-politics-20140717-ztz2b.html|title=Tony Abbott's carbon tax outrage signals nadir of post-truth politics |date=14 July 2014|accessdate=11 July 2016|author=John Connor|newspaper=The Age}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Age-futile"/&gt;&lt;ref name="TOI-brexit-trump"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://blogs.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/to-name-and-address/everything-but-the-truth-what-we-share-with-the-brexit-campaign-and-trump/|title=Life in post-truth times: What we share with the Brexit campaign and Trump|date=30 June 2016|author=Amulya Gopalakrishnan|accessdate=11 July 2016|newspaper=The Times of India}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Dunt"/&gt;&lt;ref name="NSci-revolut"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.newscientist.com/article/mg23030763-000-free-speech-has-become-sound-bites-with-revolutionary-results/|title=Free speech has met social media, with revolutionary results|date=1 June 2016|newspaper=New Scientist|accessdate=11 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2016, ''post-truth'' was chosen as the [[Oxford word of the year|Oxford Dictionaries' Word of the Year]],&lt;ref name="wordofyear"/&gt; due to its prevalence in the context of that year's [[United Kingdom European Union membership referendum, 2016|Brexit referendum]] and media coverage of the [[United States presidential election, 2016|U.S. presidential election]].&lt;ref name="Freedland-nojoke"/&gt;&lt;ref name="WaPo-era"/&gt;

==History==
According to [[OxfordDictionaries.com|Oxford Dictionaries]], the term ''post-truth'' was first used in a 1992 essay by the late Serbian-American playwright [[Steve Tesich]] in ''[[The Nation]]''. Tesich writes that following the shameful truth of [[Watergate]], more assuaging coverage of the [[Iran–Contra scandal]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nsarchive.gwu.edu/NSAEBB/NSAEBB567-Iran-Contra-Reagan-Oliver-North-and-Post-Truth-30-years-later/ |title=The Iran-Contra Affair 30 Years Later: A Milestone in Post-Truth Politics |work=National Security Archive|date=25 November 2016|accessdate=24 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Gulf War|Persian Gulf War]] demonstrate that "we, as a free people, have freely decided that we want to live in some post-truth world."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url =https://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/nov/15/post-truth-named-word-of-the-year-by-oxford-dictionaries| title= 'Post-truth' named word of the year by Oxford Dictionaries| first=Alison | last=Flood | date = 15 November 2016 | accessdate = 20 November 2016|work=The Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Kreitner |first=Richard |url=https://www.thenation.com/article/post-truth-and-its-consequences-what-a-25-year-old-essay-tells-us-about-the-current-moment/ |title=Post-Truth and Its Consequences: What a 25-Year-Old Essay Tells Us About the Current Moment |date=30 November 2016 |work=The Nation |accessdate=1 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2004, [[Ralph Keyes (author)|Ralph Keyes]] used the term "post-truth era" in his book by that title.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Keyes|first1=Ralph|title=The Post-Truth Era: Dishonesty and Deception in Contemporary Life|date=2004|publisher=[[St. Martin's Press|St. Martin's]]|location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt; The same year American journalist [[Eric Alterman]] spoke of a "post-truth political environment" and coined the term "the post-truth presidency" in his analysis of the misleading statements made by the [[Presidency of George W. Bush|Bush administration]] after 9/11.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Alterman|first1=Eric|title=When Presidents Lie: A History of Official Deception and Its Consequences|date=2004|publisher=[[Viking Press|Viking]]|location=New York|page=305}}&lt;/ref&gt; In his 2004 book ''Post-democracy'', Colin Crouch used the phrase "post-democracy" to mean a model of politics where "elections certainly exist and can change governments," but "public electoral debate is a tightly controlled spectacle, managed by rival teams of professionals expert in the techniques of persuasion, and considering a small range of issues selected by those teams." Crouch directly attributes the "advertising industry model" of political communication to the crisis of trust and accusations of dishonesty that a few years later others have associated with post-truth politics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Crouch|first1=Colin|title=Post-democracy|date=2004|publisher=[[Polity (publisher)|Polity]]|location=Cambridge, UK|page=4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term "post-truth politics" was coined by the blogger David Roberts in a blog post for ''[[Grist (magazine)|Grist]]'' on 1 April 2010, where it was defined as "a political culture in which politics (public opinion and media [[narrative]]s) have become almost entirely disconnected from policy (the substance of legislation)".&lt;ref name="HuffCoinage"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/tom-jeffery/britain-needs-more-democr_b_10699898.html|title=Britain Needs More Democracy After the EU Referendum, Not Less|author=Tom Jeffery|date=26 June 2016|accessdate=11 July 2016|website=The Huffington Post}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Coining"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://grist.org/article/2010-03-30-post-truth-politics/|title=Post-Truth Politics|date=1 April 2010|website=Grist|accessdate=11 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Post truth was used by philosopher  [[Joseph Heath]] to describe the [[2014 Ontario election]]. The term became widespread during the campaigns for the [[United States presidential election, 2016|2016 presidential election]] in the United States and the [[United Kingdom European Union membership referendum, 2016|2016 "Brexit" referendum on membership in the European Union]] in the United Kingdom.&lt;ref name="Freedland-nojoke"/&gt;&lt;ref name="WaPo-era"/&gt; [[OxfordDictionaries.com|Oxford Dictionaries]] declared that its international word of the year in 2016 is "post-truth", citing a 2,000% increase in usage compared to 2015.&lt;ref name="wordofyear"&gt;{{cite web |last=Flood |first=Alison |url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/nov/15/post-truth-named-word-of-the-year-by-oxford-dictionaries |title='Post-truth' named word of the year by Oxford Dictionaries |work=The Guardian |date=15 November 2016 |accessdate=16 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Jennifer Hochschild, H.L. Jayne Professor of Government at [[Harvard University]], has described the rise of post-truth as a return to 18th and 19th century political and media practices in the United States, following a period in the 20th century where the media was relatively balanced and rhetoric was toned down.&lt;ref name="Harvard-politics"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.harvard.edu/gazette/story/2016/07/politics-in-a-post-truth-age/|title=Politics in a 'post-truth' age|newspaper=[[Harvard Gazette]]|date=14 July 2016|accessdate=6 August 2016|author= Christina Pazzanese}}&lt;/ref&gt;  (Not so in Britain and elsewhere necessarily; for example, in 1957 scientist [[Kathleen Lonsdale]] remarked that "for many people truthfulness in politics has now become a mockery.... Anyone who listens to the radio in a mixed company of thinking people knows how deep-seated is this cynicism." &lt;ref&gt;Kathleen Lonsdale, ''Is Peace Possible?'' by Penguin Books, 1957, p 11&lt;/ref&gt;) 

The [[pamphlet wars]] that arose with the growth of printing and literacy beginning in the 1600s have been described as an early form of post-truth politics. Slanderous and vitriolic pamphlets were cheaply printed and widely disseminated, and the dissent that they fomented contributed to starting wars and revolutions such as the [[English Civil War]] and the [[American War of Independence]].&lt;ref name="NSci-revolut"/&gt;

A defining trait of post-truth politics is that campaigners continue to repeat their talking points, even when media outlets, experts in the field in question, and others provide proof that contradicts these talking points.&lt;ref name="Preston"&gt;{{cite news|title=Broadcast news is losing its balance in the post-truth era|url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/2012/sep/09/post-truth-politics-us-broadcasting|date=9 September 2012|accessdate=11 July 2016|author=Peter Preston|newspaper=The Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, during campaigning for the British EU referendum campaign, [[Vote Leave]] made repeated use of the claim that EU membership cost £350&amp;nbsp;million a week, although later began to use the figure as a net amount of money sent directly to the EU.

[[Michael Deacon (journalist)|Michael Deacon]], [[parliamentary sketch writing|parliamentary sketchwriter]] for ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]'', summarised the core message of post-truth politics as "Facts are negative. Facts are pessimistic. Facts are unpatriotic."  He added that post-truth politics can also include a claimed rejection of [[Polarization (politics)|partisanship]] and [[negative campaigning]].&lt;ref name="Deacon"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2016/07/09/in-a-world-of-post-truth-politics-andrea-leadsom-will-make-the-p/|title=In a world of post-truth politics, Andrea Leadsom will make the perfect PM |author=Michael Deacon|date=9 July 2016|accessdate=11 July 2016|newspaper=The Daily Telegraph}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this context, campaigners can push a [[utopia]]n "positive campaign" to which rebuttals can be dismissed as [[Smear campaign|smears]] and [[scaremongering]] and opposition as partisan.&lt;ref name="Coining"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Deacon"/&gt;

In contrast to simply telling untruths, writers such as Jack Holmes of ''[[Esquire (magazine)|Esquire]]'' describe the process as something different, with Holmes putting it as: "So, if you don't know what's true, you can say whatever you want and it's not a lie".&lt;ref name="Holmes"/&gt;

==Drivers==
In 2015 media and Politics scholar Jayson Harsin coined the term "regime of post-truth" which encompasses many aspects of post-truth politics. He argues that a convergent set of developments have created the conditions of post-truth society: the political communication informed by cognitive science, which aims at managing perception and belief of segmented populations through techniques like [[microtargeting]] which includes the strategic use of [[Rumor#Political communication strategy|rumors]] and falsehoods; the fragmentation of modern, more centralized mass news media gatekeepers, which have largely repeated one another's scoops and their reports; the attention economy marked by information overload and acceleration, user-generated content and fewer society-wide common trusted authorities to distinguish between truth and lies, accurate and inaccurate; the algorithms which govern what appears in social media and search engine rankings, based on what users want (per algorithm) and not on what is factual; and news media which have been marred by scandals of plagiarism, hoaxes, propaganda, and changing news values. These developments have occurred on the background of economic crises, downsizing and favoring trends toward more traditional [[Tabloid (newspaper format)|tabloid]] stories and [[Tabloid journalism|styles of reporting]], known as tabloidization&lt;ref&gt;Frank Esser [http://ejc.sagepub.com/content/14/3/291.short?rss=1&amp;ssource=mfc `Tabloidization' of News. A Comparative Analysis of Anglo-American and German Press Journalism] European Journal of Communication Vol 14, Issue 3, 1999 September 1, 1999&lt;/ref&gt;  and [[infotainment]].  

While some of these phenomena (such as a more tabloidesque press) may suggest a return to the past, the effect of the convergences is a socio-political phenomenon which exceeds earlier forms of journalism in deliberate distortion and struggle. Fact-checking and rumor-busting sites abound, but they are unable to reunite a fragmented set of audiences (attention-wise) and their respective trustful-/distrustfulness.  Harsin has called it a "regime of post-truth" instead of merely post-truth politics, professional pan-partisan political communication manipulates the communication competitively.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|date=24 February 2015|title=Regimes of Posttruth, Postpolitics, and Attention Economies|journal=Communication, Culture &amp; Critique|volume=8|issue=2|pages=327–333|last1=Harsin|first1=Jayson}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Major news outlets ===
Several trends in the media landscape have been blamed for the perceived rise of post-truth politics. One contributing factor has been the proliferation of state-funded news agencies like [[CCTV News]] and [[RT (TV network)|RT]], and [[Voice of America]] in the USA which allow states to influence [[Western world|Western]] audiences. According to [[Peter Pomerantsev]], a British-Russian journalist who worked for [[TNT (Russian TV channel)|TNT]] in Moscow, one of their prime objectives has been to de-legitimize Western institutions, including the structures of government, democracy, and human rights.{{citation needed|date=December 2016}} 
As of 2016, trust in the mainstream media in the US had reached historical lows.&lt;ref name="WaPo-era"&gt;{{cite news|title=Why the post-truth political era might be around for a while|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/posteverything/wp/2016/06/16/why-the-post-truth-political-era-might-be-around-for-a-while/|author=[[Daniel W. Drezner]]|date=16 June 2016|accessdate=11 July 2016|newspaper=The Washington Post}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
It has been suggested that under these conditions, [[Fact checker|fact checking]] by news outlets struggles to gain traction among the wider public&lt;ref name="WaPo-era" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Delivering trust: Impartiality and objectivity in the digital age|date=January 2012|author=Richard Sambrook|url=http://orca.cf.ac.uk/33772/1/Delivering_Trust_Impartiality_and_Objectivity_in_a_Digital_Age.pdf|website=Reuters Institute for the Study of Journalism|publisher=University of Oxford}}&lt;/ref&gt; and that politicians resort to increasingly drastic messaging.&lt;ref name="Age-futile"&gt;{{cite news|title=Facts are futile in an era of post-truth politics|url=http://www.theage.com.au/comment/facts-are-futile-in-an-era-of-posttruth-politics-20140227-33m70.html|author=Gay Alcorn|newspaper=The Age|date=27 February 2014|accessdate=11 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many news outlets desire to appear to be, or have a policy of being, [[impartiality|impartial]]. Many writers have noted that in some cases, this leads to [[false balance]], the practice of giving equal emphasis to unsupported or discredited claims without challenging their factual basis.&lt;ref&gt;

But a major media organization taking meaningful steps to do something about it is."&lt;/ref&gt; The 24-hour news cycle also means that news channels repeatedly draw on the same public figures, which benefits PR-savvy politicians and means that presentation and personality can have a larger impact on the audience than facts,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Post-Truth Era: Dishonesty and Deception in Contemporary Life|pages=127–128|year=2004|author=Ralph Keyes|isbn=9781429976220}}&lt;/ref&gt; while the process of claim and counter-claim can provide grist for days of news coverage at the expense of deeper analysis of the case.&lt;ref name="TOI-brexit-trump"/&gt;

=== Social media and the Internet ===
[[Social media]] adds an additional dimension, as user networks can become [[Echo chamber (media)|echo chambers]] possibly emphasised by the [[filter bubble]] where one political viewpoint dominates and scrutiny of claims fails,&lt;ref name="TOI-brexit-trump" /&gt;&lt;ref name="NSci-revolut" /&gt;&lt;ref name="FT-trust"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/24035fc2-3e45-11e6-9f2c-36b487ebd80a.html|title=Why we no longer trust the experts|date=1 July 2016|author=Gillian Tett|accessdate=11 July 2016|newspaper=Financial Times}}&lt;/ref&gt; allowing a parallel [[media ecosystem]] of websites, publishers and news channels to develop, which can repeat post-truth claims without rebuttal.&lt;ref name="Humanist"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://thehumanist.com/magazine/january-february-2016/church-state/humanists-rise-post-truth-america|title=Humanists and the Rise of "Post-Truth America"|date=22 December 2015|author=Rob Boston|accessdate=6 August 2016|newspaper=The Humanist}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In this environment, post-truth campaigns can ignore fact checks or dismiss them as being motivated by bias.&lt;ref name="Indy" /&gt; ''[[The Guardian]]'' editor-in-chief [[Katherine Viner]] laid some of the blame on the rise of [[clickbait]], articles of dubious factual content with a misleading headline and which are designed to be widely shared, saying that "chasing down cheap clicks at the expense of accuracy and veracity" undermines the value of journalism and truth.&lt;ref name="Viner"&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/2016/jul/12/how-technology-disrupted-the-truth| title=How technology disrupted the truth| date=12 July 2016|accessdate=12 July 2016|newspaper=The Guardian|author=Katherine Viner}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2016, David Mikkelson, co-founder of the [[fact checking]] and [[debunking]] site ''[[Snopes.com]]'', described the introduction of social media and [[fake news sites]] as a turning point, saying "I’m not sure I’d call it a post-truth age but … there’s been an opening of the sluice-gate and everything is pouring through. The bilge keeps coming faster than you can pump."&lt;ref name="snopes"&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/aug/01/snopes-com-internet-fact-checker-post-truth-david-mikkelson| title=Can mythbusters like Snopes.com keep up in a post-truth era?| date=1 August 2016|author=Rory Carroll|accessdate=23 October 2016|newspaper=The Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The digital culture allows anybody with a computer and access to the internet to post their opinions online and mark them as fact which may become legitimized through echo-chambers and other users validating one another. Content may be judged based on how many views a post gets, creating an atmosphere that appeals to emotion, audience biases, or headline appeal instead of researched fact. Content which gets more views is continually filtered around different internet circles, regardless of its legitimacy. Some also argue that the abundance of fact available at any time on the internet leads to an attitude focused on knowing basic claims to information instead of an underlying truth or formulating carefully thought-out opinions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://opentranscripts.org/transcript/post-truth-politics/|title=Is Digital Culture Responsible for Post-Truth Politics? - Eliane Glaser {{!}} Open Transcripts|work=Open Transcripts|access-date=2017-03-03|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; The internet allows people to choose where they get their information, allowing them to reinforce their own opinions.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/08/24/opinion/campaign-stops/the-age-of-post-truth-politics.html|title=The Age of Post-Truth Politics|last=Davies|first=William|date=2016-08-24|work=The New York Times|access-date=2017-03-03|issn=0362-4331}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Polarized political culture ===
The rise of post-truth politics coincides with polarized political beliefs. A [[Pew Research Center]] study of American adults found that "those with the most consistent ideological views on the left and right have information streams that are distinct from those of individuals with more mixed political views—and very distinct from each other".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Amy Mitchell|first1=Amy|last2=Kiley|first2=Jocelyn|last3=Eva Matsa|first3=Katerina|last4=Gottfied|first4=Jeffrey|title=Political Polarization &amp; Media Habits|url=http://www.journalism.org/2014/10/21/political-polarization-media-habits/|publisher=Pew Research Center|accessdate=31 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Data is becoming increasingly accessible as new technologies are introduced to the everyday lives of citizens. An obsession for data and statistics also filters into the political scene, and political debates and speeches become filled with snippets of information that may be misconstrued, false, or not contain the whole picture. Sensationalized television news emphasizes grand statements and further publicizes politicians. This shaping from the media influences how the public views political issues and candidates.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;

== Dissenting views ==

In an editorial, ''[[New Scientist]]'' suggested "a cynic might wonder if politicians are actually any more dishonest than they used to be", and hypothesized that "fibs once whispered into select ears are now overheard by everyone".&lt;ref name="NSci-revolut"/&gt; Similarly, Viner suggested that while social media has helped some untruths to spread, it has also restrained others; as an example, she said ''[[The Sun (United Kingdom)|The Sun]]''{{'}}s false "[[Hillsborough disaster#The Sun|The Truth]]" story following the [[Hillsborough disaster]], and the associated police cover-up, would be hard to imagine in the social media age.&lt;ref name="Viner"/&gt; The journalist George Gillett has suggested that the term "post-truth" mistakenly conflates empirical and ethical judgements, writing that the supposedly "post-truth" movement is in fact a rebellion against "expert economic opinion becoming a surrogate for values-based political judgements".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://georgegillett.com/2017/04/20/the-myth-of-post-truth-politics/|title=The myth of post-truth politics|date=20 April 2017|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Toby Young]], writing for ''[[The Spectator]]'', called the term a "cliché" used selectively primarily by [[left-wing]] commentators to attack what are actually universal [[Confirmation bias|ideological bias]]es, contending that "[w]e are all post-truthers and probably always have been".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.spectator.co.uk/2016/07/the-truth-about-post-truth-politics/|title=The truth about 'post-truth politics'|date=16 July 2016&lt;!-- Print date, presumably - web article was online earlier--&gt;|accessdate=14 July 2016|author=Toby Young|newspaper=The Spectator}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[The Economist]]'' has called this argument "complacent", however, identifying a qualitative difference between political scandals of previous generations, such as those surrounding the [[Suez Crisis]] and the [[Iran–Contra affair]] (which involved attempting to cover-up the truth) and contemporary ones in which public facts are simply ignored.&lt;ref name=economist-10-9-16/&gt; Similarly, Alexios Mantzarlis of the [[Poynter Institute]] said that political lies were not new and identified several political campaigns in history which would now be described as "post-truth". For Mantzarlis, the "post-truth" label was—to some extent—a "[[coping mechanism]] for commentators reacting to attacks on not just any facts, but on those central to their belief system", but also noted that 2016 had been "an acrimonious year for politics on both sides of the Atlantic".&lt;ref name="Poynter"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.poynter.org/2016/no-were-not-in-a-post-fact-era/421582/|title=No, we’re not in a ‘post-fact’ era|date=21 July 2016|accessdate=27 October 2016|author=Alexios Mantzarlis|website=Poynter Institute}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mantzarlis also noted that interest in [[fact checking]] had never been higher, suggesting that at least part of the electorate rejects "post-truth" politics.&lt;ref name="Poynter"/&gt;&lt;ref name="WP"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/fact-check-this-is-not-really-a-post-fact-election/2016/10/07/7ef5f8fa-85c0-11e6-92c2-14b64f3d453f_story.html|title=Fact check: This is not really a post-fact election|publisher=Washington Post|date=7 October 2016|accessdate=27 October 2016|author=Alexios Mantzarlis}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[David Helfand]] argues, following Edward M. Harris, that "public prevarication is nothing new" and that it is the "knowledge of the audience" and the "limits of plausibility" within a technology-saturated environment that have changed. We are, rather, in an age of misinformation where such limits of plausibility have vanished and where everyone feels equally qualified to make claims that are easily shared and propagated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Helfand |first1=David J. |authorlink1=David Helfand |title=Surviving the Misinformation Age |journal=[[Skeptical Inquirer]] |date=2017 |volume=41 |issue=3 |pages=34-39 |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181006193643/https://www.csicop.org/si/show/surviving_the_misinformation_age |accessdate=6 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Examples==
Post-truth politics has been applied as a political buzzword to a wide range of political cultures; one article in ''The Economist'' identified post-truth politics in [[Austria]], [[Germany]], [[North Korea]], [[Poland]], [[Russia]], [[Turkey]], the [[United Kingdom]], and the [[United States]].&lt;ref name=economist-10-9-16/&gt;

===Germany===

In December 2016 "[[:de:Postfaktische Politik|postfaktisch]]" (post-factual) was named word of the year by the ''[[Gesellschaft für deutsche Sprache]]'' (''German language society''), also in connection with a rise of [[right-wing populism]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://gfds.de/wort-des-jahres-2016/|title=GfdS wählt »postfaktisch« zum Wort des Jahres 2016|date=9 December 2016|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; from [[Alternative for Germany#Petry assumes leadership, Lucke quits|2015]] on.  Since the 1990s, "[[Colin Crouch#Post Democracy|post-democracy]]" was used in sociology more and more.

===India===
Amulya Gopalakrishnan, columnist for ''[[The Times of India]]'', identified similarities between the Trump and Brexit campaigns on the one hand, and [[hot-button issue]]s in India such as the [[Ishrat Jahan case]] and the ongoing case against [[Teesta Setalvad]] on the other, where accusations of forged evidence and [[historical revisionism]] have resulted in an "ideological impasse".&lt;ref name="TOI-brexit-trump"/&gt;

You've got to connect with people emotionally. It's the Trump success."&lt;ref name="Deacon"/&gt; [[Andrea Leadsom]]—a prominent campaigner for Leave in the EU referendum and one of the two final candidates in the [[Conservative Party (UK) leadership election, 2016|Conservative leadership election]]—has been singled out as a post-truth politician,&lt;ref name="Deacon"/&gt; especially after she denied having disparaged rival [[Theresa May]]'s childlessness in an interview with ''[[The Times]]'' in spite of transcript evidence.&lt;ref name="Viner"/&gt;

===United States===
In its original formulation, the phrase "post-truth politics" was used to describe the paradoxical situation in the United States where the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]], which enforced stricter [[party discipline]] than the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]], was nevertheless able to present itself as more [[bipartisan]], since individual Democrats were more likely to support Republican policies than vice versa.&lt;ref name="Coining"/&gt; The term was used by [[Paul Krugman]] in ''[[The New York Times]]'' to describe [[Mitt Romney presidential campaign, 2012|Mitt Romney's 2012 presidential campaign]] in which certain claims—such as that [[Barack Obama]] had cut defense spending and that he had embarked on an "apology tour"—continued to be repeated long after they had been debunked.&lt;ref name="Krugman"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/12/23/opinion/krugman-the-post-truth-campaign.html|title=The Post-Truth Campaign|date=23 December 2011|author=Paul Krugman|newspaper=The New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other forms of scientific [[denialism]] in modern American politics include the [[anti-vaxxer]] movement, and the [[Genetically modified food controversies|belief that existing genetically modified foods are harmful]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url=http://yoelinbar.net/papers/gmo_absolute.pdf|title=Evidence for Absolute Moral Opposition to Genetically Modified Food in the United States|first1=Sydney E.|last1=Scott|first2=Yoel|last2=Inbar|first3=Paul|last3=Rozin|journal=Perspectives on Psychological Science|date=2016|volume=11|issue=3|pages=315–324|doi=10.1177/1745691615621275|pmid=27217243}}&lt;/ref&gt; despite a strong scientific consensus that no currently marketed GMO foods have any negative health effects.&lt;ref&gt;See {{section link|Denialism|Genetically modified foods}} for extensive citations.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[health freedom movement]] in the U.S. resulted in the passage of the bipartisan [[Dietary Supplement Health and Education Act of 1994]], which allows the sale of dietary supplements without any evidence that they are safe or effective for the purposes consumers expect, though the FDA has begun regulation of [[homeopathic]] products.

In a review for the ''[[Harvard Gazette]]'', Christopher Robichaud—a lecturer in ethics and public policy at [[Harvard Kennedy School]]—described [[conspiracy theories]] about the legitimacy of elections and politicians, such as the "[[Barack Obama citizenship conspiracy theories|birther]]" idea that [[Barack Obama]] is not a [[Natural-born-citizen clause|natural-born U.S. citizen]],&lt;!--, and claims from the [[Bernie Sanders]] [[Bernie Sanders presidential campaign, 2016|presidential campaign]] that the [[Democratic Party presidential primaries, 2016|Democratic Party candidate selection]] was rigged towards [[Hillary Clinton]]--&gt;&amp;nbsp;as one side-effect of post-truth politics. Robichaud also contrasted the behaviour of the candidates with that following the contested result of the [[United States presidential election, 2000|2000 election]], in which [[Al Gore]] conceded and encouraged his supporters to accept the result of ''[[Bush v. Gore]]''.&lt;ref name="Harvard-politics"/&gt; Similarly, [[Rob Boston]], writing for ''[[The Humanist]]'' saw a rise in conspiracy theories across American public life, including [[Barack Obama citizenship conspiracy theories|Birtherism]], [[climate change denial]]ism, and [[Creation–evolution controversy|rejecting evolution]], which he identified as a result of post-truth politics, noting that the existence of extensive and widely available evidence against these conspiracy theories had not slowed their growth.&lt;ref name="Humanist"/&gt;

In 2016, the "post-truth" label was especially widely used to describe the [[Donald Trump presidential campaign, 2016|presidential campaign of Donald Trump]], including by Professor [[Daniel W. Drezner]] in ''[[The Washington Post]]'',&lt;ref name="WaPo-era"/&gt; [[Jonathan Freedland]] in ''[[The Guardian]]'',&lt;ref name="Freedland-nojoke"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/may/13/boris-johnson-donald-trump-post-truth-politician|title=Post-truth politicians such as Donald Trump and Boris Johnson are no joke |author=Jonathan Freedland|date=13 May 2016|accessdate=11 July 2016|newspaper=The Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Chris Cillizza]] in ''[[The Independent]]'',&lt;ref name="Indy"/&gt; Jeet Heer in ''[[The New Republic]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last = Heer | first = Jeet | date = 1 December 2015 | title = Donald Trump Is Not a Liar; He's something worse: a bullshit artist | magazine = The New Republic | url = https://newrepublic.com/article/124803/donald-trump-not-liar | accessdate = 22 July 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[James Kirchick]] in the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'',&lt;ref name="LATimes"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.latimes.com/opinion/op-ed/la-oe-kirchick-brexit-trump-20160629-snap-story.html|title=What Trump and the Brexiteers have in common |author=James Kerchick|date=29 June 2016|accessdate=11 July 2016|newspaper=Los Angeles Times}}&lt;/ref&gt; and by several professors of government and history at Harvard.&lt;ref name="Harvard-politics"/&gt; In 2017, ''[[The New York Times]]'', ''The Washington Post'', and others, have pointed out lies or falsehoods in Trump's statements after the election.&lt;ref name="NYT-20170623"&gt;{{cite news |last1=Leonhardt |first1=David |last2=Thompson |first2=Stuart A. |title=Trump’s Lies |url=https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2017/06/23/opinion/trumps-lies.html |work=[[New York Times]] |date=23 June 2017 |accessdate=24  June 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="NYT-20170427"&gt;{{cite news |last=Qui |first=Linda |title=Fact-Checking President Trump Through His First 100 Days |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/29/us/politics/fact-checking-president-trump-through-his-first-100-days.html |date=27 April 2017 |work=[[New York Times]] |accessdate=25 June 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="WP-20170501"&gt;{{cite news |last1=Kessler |first1=Glenn |last2=Lee |first2=Michelle Ye Hee |title=Fact Checker Analysis - President Trump’s first 100 days: The fact check tally |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/fact-checker/wp/2017/05/01/president-trumps-first-100-days-the-fact-check-tally/ |date=1 May 2017 |work=[[Washington Post]] |accessdate=25 June 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="CT-20170624"&gt;{{cite news |last1=Drinkard |first1=Jim |last2=Woodward |first2=Calvin |title=Fact check: Trump's missions unaccomplished despite his claims |url=http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/nationworld/politics/factcheck/ct-fact-check-trump-missions-20170624-story.html |date=24 June 2017 |work=[[Chicago Tribune]] |accessdate=25 June 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Former president Barack Obama stated that the new media ecosystem "means everything is true and nothing is true".&lt;ref name="NYM-20161128"&gt;{{cite web |last=Remnick |first=David |title=Obama Reckons With A Trump Presidency |url=http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2016/11/28/obama-reckons-with-a-trump-presidency |date=28 November 2016 |work=[[The New Yorker]] |accessdate=24 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Environmental politics===
Although the [[scientific opinion on climate change|consensus among scientists]] is that [[global warming|human activities contribute to global warming]], several political parties around the world have made [[climate change denial]] a basis of their policies. These parties have been accused of using post-truth techniques to attack environmental measures meant to combat climate changes to benefit industry donors.&lt;ref name="WasteManagement"&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://search.informit.com.au/documentSummary;dn=687980493190405;res=IELENG|last=Connor|first=John|title=Climate change and post-truth politics|journal=Waste Management and Environment|volume=22|issue=10|date=November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the course of the most recent 2016 election, the United States has seen numerous climate change deniers rise to power, such as new [[United States Environmental Protection Agency|Environmental Protection Agency]] head [[Scott Pruitt]] replacing Barack Obama's appointee [[Gina McCarthy]]. In Australia, the repeal of [[Carbon pricing in Australia|carbon pricing]] by the [[Abbott ministry|government]] of [[Tony Abbott]] was described as "the nadir of post-truth politics" by ''[[The Age]]''.&lt;ref name="Age-abbott"/&gt;

{{undue|date=March 2018|section|reason=What makes this professor's theory notable and no other?}}
Both technology companies and governments have started to make efforts to tackle the challenge of "post-truth politics". In an article for the journal ''[[Global Policy]]'', professor [[Nayef Al-Rodhan]] suggested four particular responses:&lt;ref&gt;''[http://www.globalpolicyjournal.com/blog/07/06/2017/post-truth-politics-fifth-estate-and-securitization-fake-news Nayef Al-Rodhan, "Post-Truth Politics, the Fifth Estate and the Securitization of Fake News]'', Global Policy Journal, 7th June 2017&lt;/ref&gt;

# ''Improve the technological tools for fact checking.'' For example, Germany has already asked [[Facebook]] to introduce a [[fake news]] filtering tool. 
# ''Greater involvement and visibility for scientists and the scientific community.'' The UK, for instance, has a series of Parliamentary committees at which scientists are called to testify, and present their research to inform policy-making.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://medium.com/oxford-university/policy-making-and-parliament-in-an-era-of-post-truth-1086d153e619 |title=Policy-making and parliament in an era of ‘post-truth’ |publisher=Medium.com |date=2017-02-28 |accessdate=2018-03-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;
# ''Stronger government action.'' In countries such as the Czech Republic, new units have been set up to tackle fake news.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Robert Tait in Prague |url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/2016/dec/28/czech-republic-to-fight-fake-news-with-specialist-unit |title=Czech Republic to fight 'fake news' with specialist unit &amp;#124; Media |publisher=The Guardian |date= |accessdate=2018-03-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; The most important challenge here is to ensure that such state-led efforts are not used as a tool for censorship.
# ''Securitizing fake news.'' It is important to treat post-truth politics as a matter of security and devise global efforts to counter this phenomenon. In March 2017, the United Nations Special Rapporteur on Freedom of Opinion and Expression, the OSCE, and the Organization for American States issued a Joint Declaration on "Freedom of Expression and Fake News, Disinformation and Propaganda" to warn against the effects of fake news but, at the same time, condemn any attempts at state-mandated censorship.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.un.org/apps/news/story.asp?NewsID=56336#.WVOi61t9671 |title=Amid rise of ‘fake news,’ authorities should ensure truthful info reaches public – UN, regional experts &amp;#124; UN News |publisher=Un.org |date=2017-03-10 |accessdate=2018-03-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Kutner |first=Max |url=http://www.newsweek.com/edward-snowden-jack-dorsey-twitter-periscope-531573 |title=Edward Snowden: Fight ‘Fake News’ With Truth, Not Censorship |publisher=Newsweek.com |date= |accessdate=2018-03-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6439">'''Postponement of affect''' is a [[defence mechanism]] which may be used against a variety of feelings or [[emotion]]s. Such a 'temporal displacement, resulting simply in a later appearance of the [[Affect (psychology)|affect]] reaction and in thus preventing the recognition of the motivating connection, is most frequently used against the affects of rage (or annoyance) and grief'.&lt;ref&gt;Otto Fenichel, ''The Psychoanalytic Theory of Neurosis'' (London 1946) p. 162&lt;/ref&gt;

==Negative postponement: repression==
===Grief===

In the affect of [[grief]], postponement seems to be an essential component. What happens in mourning is nothing other than a gradual "working-through" of an affect which, if released in its full strength, would overwhelm the ego'.&lt;ref&gt;Fenichel, p. 164&lt;/ref&gt; [[John Bowlby]] considered the first of the "four phases of mourning" to be a 'Phase of numbness that...may be interrupted by outbursts of extremely intense distress and/or anger'.&lt;ref&gt;John Bowlby, ''The Making and Breaking of Affectional Bonds'' (London 1979) p. 83&lt;/ref&gt; Thus one can speak of 'a rather typical postponement of grief':&lt;ref&gt;Adolf Hanren, ''Responding to Loss'' (2004) p. 64&lt;/ref&gt; '"I feel hurt about something and then automatically this kind of shields things up and then I feel like I can't really touch or feel anything very much"...''postponement''...[of] the weepiness'.&lt;ref&gt;Carl Rogers, ''On Becoming a Person'' (19610 p. 141&lt;/ref&gt;

Conversely, [[Eric Lindemann]], describing 'the symptomatology and management of acute grief following the [[Cocoanut Grove fire|Coconut Grove]] night-club fire...showed that people who do not "break down" and express feelings appropriate to a bereavement may suffer from delayed or distorted grief'.&lt;ref&gt;C. M. Parkes, "Bereavement", in Richard L. Gregory, ''The Oxford Companion to the Mind'' (Oxford 1987) p. 79&lt;/ref&gt;

===Fright===

Investigation of 'the reaction of the ego to acute mortal danger...repeatedly found an absence of fear during the period of acute danger, but a subsequent appearance of acute fear when the danger was past'.&lt;ref name="Fenichel162"&gt;Fenichel, p. 162&lt;/ref&gt; This may be a contributing factor in [[post-traumatic stress disorder]], where the sufferer may be 'the victim...of a blocked fear tension...he hadn't had the time to feel the fear'.&lt;ref&gt;Berne, p. 187&lt;/ref&gt;

'The postponement of fright is so well known to movie writers that it is not only frequently used but also designated by a special term: [[Double-take (comedy)|double-take]]'.&lt;ref name="Fenichel162"/&gt;

===Guilt===

Defence against guilt feelings may involve people using postponement by way of 'an ''isolation'' of guilt feeling...they do things without any guilt feeling, and experience an exaggerated feeling of guilt on some other occasion without being aware of the connection'.&lt;ref&gt;Fenichel, p. 166&lt;/ref&gt; Such postponement can be linked to [[Nietzsche]]'s concept of the "pale criminal" or 'neurotic immoralist...the "pale felon" who does not live up to his acts'&lt;ref&gt;C. G. Jung, ''Two Essays on Analytical Psychology'' (London 1953) p. 25-6&lt;/ref&gt; – retrospective guilt: 'he was equal to his deed when he did it; but he could not bear its image after it was done...now the lead of his guilt lies upon him'.&lt;ref&gt;Walter Kaufman trans., ''The Portable Nietzsche'' (London 1987) p. 150-1&lt;/ref&gt;

A similar postponement of guilt may be seen in everyday life, as when 'a woman may decide that her Superego will permit her to cheat on her spouse...[but] may begin to feel guilty many years afterwards..&lt;ref&gt;Eric Berne, ''A Layman's Guide to Psychiatry and Psychoanalysis'' (Penguin 1976) p. 191&lt;/ref&gt;

In pathological form something similar would seem to occur 'during a melancholic attack', or so Freud surmised: the 'super-ego becomes over-severe, abuses the poor ego...reproaches it for actions in the remotest past which had been taken lightly at the time – as though it had spent the whole interval in collecting accusations and had only been waiting for its current access of strength in order to bring them up'.&lt;ref&gt;Sigmund Freud, ''New Introductory Lectures'' (PFL 2) p. 92&lt;/ref&gt;

Conversely, 'people who can muster the courage to face up to their guilt...will not suffer as long from the agony of the cognitive rehearsal of the guilt situation as people who postpone facing up to their guilt'.&lt;ref&gt;Carroll Ellis Izard, ''Human Emotions'' (1977) p. 425&lt;/ref&gt;

==Positive postponement: suppression==

Freud saw the development of the [[reality principle]] as a process which 'demands and carries into effect the postponement of satisfaction...and the temporary toleration of unpleasure as a step on the long indirect road to pleasure'.&lt;ref&gt;Sigmund Freud, ''On Metapsychology'' (PFL 11) p. 278&lt;/ref&gt; Such impulse control has been seen as a key component in [[emotional intelligence]]. 'The ability to [[Deferred gratification|delay gratification]] contributes powerfully to intellectual potential quite apart from IQ itself', while what has been called '"goal-directed self-imposed delay of gratification" is perhaps the essence of emotional self-regulation: the ability to deny impulse in the service of a goal'.&lt;ref&gt;[[Daniel Goleman]], ''Emotional Intelligence'' (London 1996) p. 82-3&lt;/ref&gt;

Similarly, among the [[defence mechanisms]], as part of 'the ''mature'' ways of dealing with real stress...there's ''suppression'' – instead of repressing a frightening feeling and pushing it right out of awareness, you hold it in check and bear the discomfort of ''feeling'' it. That means you are more likely to be able to work out how to handle it, given a bit of time'.&lt;ref&gt;[[Robin Skynner]]/[[John Cleese]], ''[[Life and How to Survive It]]'' (London 1994 p. 55&lt;/ref&gt; In this sense, 'delaying, as opposed to avoidance, is a fine mechanism, another form of the method of learning I call step-by-step'.&lt;ref&gt;Elaine N. Aron, ''The Highly Sensitive Person'' (London 1999) p. 84&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''propositional attitude''' is a mental state held by an agent toward a [[proposition]]. Propositional attitudes are often assumed to be the fundamental units of thought and their contents, being propositions, are true or false from the perspective of the person. An agent can have different propositional attitudes toward the same proposition (e.g., "S believes that her ice-cream is cold," and "S fears that her ice-cream is cold").

Linguistically, propositional attitudes are denoted by a verb  (e.g. "believed") governing an embedded "that" clause, for example, 'Sally believed that she had won'.

Propositional attitudes have [[direction of fit|directions of fit]]:  some are meant to reflect the world, others to influence it.

==Overview==
&lt;blockquote&gt;
What sort of name shall we give to verbs like 'believe' and 'wish' and so forth?  I should be inclined to call them 'propositional verbs'.  This is merely a suggested name for convenience, because they are verbs which have the ''form'' of relating an object to a proposition.  As I have been explaining, that is not what they really do, but it is convenient to call them propositional verbs.  Of course you might call them 'attitudes', but I should not like that because it is a psychological term, and although all the instances in our experience are psychological, there is no reason to suppose that all the verbs I am talking of are psychological.  There is never any reason to suppose that sort of thing.  (Russell 1918, 227).
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

What a proposition is, is one thing.  How we feel about it, or how we regard it, is another.  We can accept it, assert it, believe it, command it, contest it, declare it, deny it, doubt it, enjoin it, exclaim it, expect it.  Different attitudes toward propositions are called ''propositional attitudes'', and they are also discussed under the headings of ''[[intentionality]]'' and ''[[linguistic modality]]''.

Many problematic situations in real life arise from the circumstance that many different propositions in many different modalities are in the air at once.  In order to compare propositions of different colours and flavours, as it were, we have no basis for comparison but to examine the underlying propositions themselves.  Thus we are brought back to matters of language and logic.  Despite the name, propositional attitudes are not regarded as psychological attitudes proper, since the formal disciplines of linguistics and logic are concerned with nothing more concrete than what can be said in general about their formal properties and their patterns of interaction.

One topic of central concern is the relation between the modalities of assertion and belief, perhaps with intention thrown in for good measure.  For example, we frequently find ourselves faced with the question of whether or not a person's assertions conform to his or her beliefs.  Discrepancies here can occur for many reasons, but when the departure of assertion from belief is intentional, we usually call that a ''[[lie]]''.

Other comparisons of multiple modalities that frequently arise are the relationships between belief and knowledge and the discrepancies that occur among observations, expectations, and intentions.  Deviations of observations from expectations are commonly perceived as ''[[surprise (emotion)|surprise]]s'', phenomena that call for ''[[explanation]]s'' to reduce the shock of amazement.

A number of software systems are now available to simulate propositional attitudes for industrial purposes, for customer relation management systems, decision support  and content generation (Galitsky 2012).

==Issues==

In logic, the formal properties of verbs like ''assert'', ''believe'', ''command'', ''consider'', ''deny'', ''doubt'', ''imagine'', ''judge'', ''know'', ''want'', ''wish'', and a host of others that involve attitudes or intentions toward propositions are notorious for their recalcitrance to analysis.
(Quine 1956).

===Indiscernibility of identicals===
&lt;blockquote&gt;
One of the fundamental principles governing identity is that of ''[[substitutivity]]''{{Clarify|date=July 2011}}, also known as [[fungibility]]&amp;nbsp;— or, as it might well be called, that of ''[[Salva veritate|indiscernibility of identicals]]''.  It provides that, ''given a true statement of identity, one of its two terms may be substituted for the other in any true statement and the result will be true''.  It is easy to find cases contrary to this principle.  For example, the statements:
{| style="width:90%"
|  style="width:10%" align="left"   | (1)
|  style="width:80%" align="center" | Giorgione = Barbarelli,
|-
|  style="width:10%" align="left"   | (2)
|  style="width:80%" align="center" | Giorgione was so-called because of his size
|}
are true;  however, replacement of the name 'Giorgione' by the name 'Barbarelli' turns (2) into the falsehood:
{| style="width:90%"
|  style="width:10%" align="left"   | &amp;nbsp;
|  style="width:80%" align="center" | Barbarelli was so-called because of his size.&lt;ref&gt;[[Willard Van Orman Quine|W. V. O. Quine]], Quintessence, extensions, Reference and Modality, P361&lt;/ref&gt;
|}
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Quine's example here refers to [[Giorgio Barbarelli]]'s [[sobriquet]] "Giorgione", an Italian name roughly glossed as "Big George." The basis of the paradox here is that while the two names signify the same individual (the meaning of the first statement), the names are not themselves identical; the second statement refers to an attribute (origin) that they do not share.

{{About||the personal right to exist|Right to life|the book|Right to Exist: a Moral Defense of Israel's Wars}}
 
[[File:Ernest Renan 1876-84.jpg|thumb|right|French historian [[Ernest Renan]] defended the right to exist in "[[What is a Nation?]]" (1882).]]

The '''right to exist''' is said to be an attribute of [[nation]]s. According to an [[What is a Nation?|essay]] by the nineteenth century French philosopher [[Ernest Renan]], a state has the right to exist when individuals are willing to sacrifice their own interests for the community it represents. Unlike [[self-determination]], the right to exist is an attribute of states rather than of peoples. It is not a right recognized in international law. The phrase has featured prominently in the [[Arab–Israeli conflict]] since the 1950s.

The right to exist of a ''de facto'' state may be balanced against another state's right to [[territorial integrity]].&lt;ref&gt;Lagerwall, Anne. "[http://www.allacademic.com/meta/p_mla_apa_research_citation/2/3/6/5/8/p236585_index.html The Paradoxical Protection of State's Territorial Integrity by the United Nations: Law versus Power?]", Paper presented at the annual meeting of the Law and Society Association, Hilton Bonaventure, Montreal, Quebec, Canada, May 27, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; Proponents of the right to exist trace it back to the "right of existence", said to be a fundamental right of states recognized by writers on international law for hundreds of years.&lt;ref name="Oppenheim"&gt;Oppenheim, Lassa and Ronald Roxburgh, (2005) ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=vxJ1Jwmyw0EC&amp;pg=PA193&amp;dq=#PPA192,M1 International Law]'', p. 192–193.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Historical use==
[[Thomas Paine]] used the phrase "right to exist" to refer to forms of government, arguing that representative government has a right to exist, but that hereditary government does not.&lt;ref&gt;Paine, Thomas, "Dissertation on the First Principles of Government" (1795), ''The Life and Works of Thomas Paine,'' 5:221--25.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1823, Sir [[Walter Scott]] argued for the "right to exist in the Greek people".&lt;ref name="google249"&gt;Scott, Walter, "[https://books.google.com/books?id=nA9uAAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA249&amp;dq= The Greek Revolution]", ''Edinburgh Annual Register of 1823'', p. 249.&lt;/ref&gt; (The Greeks were then revolting against Turkish rule.) According to Renan's "[[What is a Nation?]]" (1882), "So long as this moral
consciousness [called a nation] gives proof of its strength by the sacrifices which demand the abdication of the individual to
the advantage of the community, it is legitimate and has the right to exist. If doubts arise regarding its
frontiers, consult the populations in the areas under dispute."&lt;ref name="Renan"&gt;[[Ernest Renan|Renan, Ernest]], "[http://ig.cs.tu-berlin.de/oldstatic/w2001/eu1/dokumente/Basistexte/Renan1882EN-Nation.pdf What is a Nation?] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130319081440/http://ig.cs.tu-berlin.de/oldstatic/w2001/eu1/dokumente/Basistexte/Renan1882EN-Nation.pdf |date=2013-03-19 }}", 1882.&lt;/ref&gt; Existence is not a historical right, but "a daily [[wikt:plebiscite|plebiscite]], just as an individual's existence is a perpetual affirmation of life," Renan said.&lt;ref name="Renan"/&gt; The phrase gained enormous usage in reference to the breakup of the [[Ottoman Empire]] in 1918. "If Turkey has a right to exist – and the Powers are very prompt to assert that she has – she possesses an equally good right to defend herself against all attempts to imperil her political existence," wrote Eliakim and Robert Littell in 1903.&lt;ref&gt;Littell, Eliakim and Robert S. Littell, "The Reign of Terror in Macedonia", ''The Living Age,'' April–June 1903, p. 68.&lt;/ref&gt; In many cases, a nation's right to exist is not questioned, and is therefore not asserted.

==Examples==
===[[Armenia]]===
The right to exist of Armenia became known as the [[Armenian Question]] during the [[Congress of Berlin]] in 1878, and would again be asked during the [[Armenian Genocide]] in [[World War I]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=John Riddell|title=To the Masses: Proceedings of the Third Congress of the Communist International, 1921|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=PFLoBgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA1&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=WnYtVcLYC8KENo7IgcAK&amp;ved=0CB4Q6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|date=2014|publisher=Brill Academic|isbn= 978-90-04-28803-4|pages=28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===[[Basque Country (autonomous community)|Basque nation]]===
According to [[Basque people|Basque]] nationalists, "[[Basque Country (autonomous community)|Euzkadi]] (the name of our country in our own language) is the country of the Basques with as such right to exist independently as a nation as [[Poland]] or [[Ireland]]. The Basques are a very ancient people..."&lt;ref&gt;Nationalism, Naunihal Singh, Mittal Publications, 2006, p. 111.&lt;/ref&gt;

===[[Chechnya]]===
The phrase, "right to exist" has also been used in reference to the right of [[Chechens]] (in the eyes of supporters) to establish a state independent from Russia.&lt;ref&gt;Wood, Tony. ''Chechnya, the Case for Independence''. Page 6. Quote: "The second basis for dismissing Chechnya's right to existence is that the country had its chance at independence from 1996 to 1999..."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.watchdog.cz/?show=000000-000004-000003-000130&amp;lang=1 |title=Prague Watchdog - Crisis in Chechnya - An empire on the verge of collapse |publisher=Watchdog.cz |date= |accessdate=2012-01-21|quote=Russia’s numerous separatist movements quickly shrank to nothing, but they will once again return to life if their '''''right to exist''''', even if only in the distant future, is confirmed by the precedents of Abkhazia and South Ossetia. And here the example of Chechnya may prove to be formative.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===[[Israel]]===
{{further|Legitimacy of Israel|Jewish question}}
In 1947, a United Nations General Assembly resolution provided for the creation of an "Arab State" and a "Jewish State" to exist within [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]] in the United Nations Partition Plan for Palestine. This has been described by Prof. Joseph Massad as "a non-binding proposal that was never ratified or adopted by the Security Council, and therefore never acquired legal standing, as UN regulations require."&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{cite web|title='The rights of Israel'|author= Prof. Joseph Massad |url=http://www.aljazeera.com/indepth/opinion/2011/05/20115684218533873.html |date= 6 May 2011 |accessdate= 12 Sep 2012| quote= "In international law, countries are recognised as existing de facto and de jure, but there is no notion that any country has a 'right to exist', let alone that other countries should recognise such a right. Nonetheless, the modification by Israel of its claim that others had to recognise its 'right to exist' to their having to recognise 'its right to exist as Jewish state' is pushed most forcefully at present, as it goes to the heart of the matter of what the Zionist project has been all about since its inception, and addresses itself to the extant discrepancy between Israel's own understanding of its rights to realise these Zionist aims and the international community's differing understanding of them. This is a crucial matter, as all these rights that Israel claims to possess, but which are not recognised internationally, translate into its rights to colonise Palestinian land, to occupy it, and to discriminate against the non-Jewish Palestinian people."}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Jewish Agency]], precursor to the Israeli government, agreed to the plan, but the Palestinians rejected it and fighting broke out. After Israel's May 14, 1948 unilateral declaration of independence, support from neighboring Arab states escalated the 1947–48 Civil War in [[Mandatory Palestine]] into the 1948 Arab-Israeli War. The legal and territorial status of [[Israel]] and [[State of Palestine|Palestine]] is still hotly disputed in the region and within the international community.

According to [[Ilan Pappé]], Arab recognition of Israel's right to exist was part of [[Folke Bernadotte]]'s 1948 peace plan.&lt;ref name=pappe&gt;Ilan Pappé, ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=zAJZCKAwtPMC&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s The Making of the Arab-Israeli Conflict, 1947-1951]'', I.B.Tauris, 1994, p. 149.&lt;/ref&gt; The Arab states gave this as their reason to reject the plan.&lt;ref name=pappe/&gt; In the 1950s UK MP [[Herbert Morrison]] cited then Egyptian leader [[Abdel Nasser]] as saying "Israel is an artificial State which must disappear." .&lt;ref&gt;*"Foreign Affairs; A Time to Find a Solution for Palestine", ''New York Times'' Aug 2, 1958. "Most Arab leaders do not even dare admit Israel's right to exist. They fear assassination by fanatics."&lt;br/&gt;*''Parliamentary debates: Official report:'' Volume 547 (1956), Great Britain. Parliament. House of Commons: "I will give two short quotations, one from Colonel Nasser, the Prime Minister of Egypt, on 8th May, 1954. It is an extremist point of view based on the belief and the assertion that Israel has no right to exist at all."&lt;br/&gt;*"Arms and the Middle East", ''Toledo Blade'', Sep 30, 1955. "the Arabs still refuse to acknowledge Israel's right to exist."&lt;/ref&gt; The issue was described as the central one between Israel and the Arabs.&lt;ref&gt;"And underlying all of the questions dividing Israel and its Arab neighbors, one issue is central: Does Israel have a right to exist?" (Farrell, James Thomas, ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=AnI9AAAAMAAJ&amp;q= It has come to pass]'', 1958)&lt;/ref&gt;

After the June 1967 war, Egyptian spokesman Mohammed H. el-Zayyat stated that Cairo had accepted Israel's right to exist since the signing of the [[1949 Armistice Agreements|Egyptian-Israeli armistice]] in 1949.&lt;ref name="Whetten"&gt;{{cite book |last=Whetten |first=Lawrence L.|title=The Canal War: Four-Power Conflict in the Middle East|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=AY9tAAAAMAAJ&amp;q= |publisher=MIT Press|location=Cambridge, Massachusetts|year=1974|isbn=0-262-23069-0|page=51}}&lt;/ref&gt; He added that this did not imply [[Diplomatic recognition|recognition]] of Israel.&lt;ref name="Whetten"/&gt; In September, the Arab leaders adopted a hardline "three nos" position in the [[Khartoum Resolution]]: No peace with Israel, no recognition of Israel, and no negotiations with Israel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Khartoum Resolution|url=http://www.cfr.org/international-peace-and-security/khartoum-resolution/p14841?breadcrumb=%2Fpublication%2Fpublication_list%3Ftype%3Dessential_document%26page%3D69|publisher=[[Council on Foreign Relations]]|accessdate=7 June 2012|quote=The Khartoum Resolution passed by the Arab League in the wake of the 1967 war is famous for the "Three Nos" articulated in the third paragraph: No peace with Israel, no recognition of Israel, and no negotiations with Israel.|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120520124345/http://www.cfr.org/international-peace-and-security/khartoum-resolution/p14841?breadcrumb=%2Fpublication%2Fpublication_list%3Ftype%3Dessential_document%26page%3D69|archivedate=20 May 2012|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; But in November, Egypt accepted [[UN Security Council Resolution 242]], which implied acceptance of Israel's right to exist. At the same time, President [[Gamal Abdel Nasser]] urged [[Yasser Arafat]] and other Palestinian leaders to reject the resolution. "You must be our irresponsible arm," he said.&lt;ref&gt;Alexander, Anne, ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=CRbNAZFfggwC&amp;pg=PA150&amp;lpg=PA150&amp;dq= Nasser]'', p. 150. {{ISBN|1-904341-83-7}}.&lt;/ref&gt; King Hussein of Jordan also acknowledged that Israel had a right to exist at this time.&lt;ref&gt;Dennon, Leon, "Key to Peace in Mideast", ''Owosso Argus-Press'', Nov 25, 1967.&lt;/ref&gt; Meanwhile, Syria rejected Resolution 242, saying that it, "refers to Israel's right to exist and it ignores the right of the [Palestinian] refugees to return to their homes."&lt;ref&gt;Lukacs, Yehuda, ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=Mv8R-o_b0acC&amp;dq= Israel, Jordan, and the Peace Process]'', 1999. Syracuse University Press, pp. 98–99.&lt;/ref&gt;

Upon assuming the [[Prime Minister of Israel|premier]]ship in 1977, [[Menachem Begin]] spoke as follows:
Our right to exist—have you ever heard of such a thing?

As reported by the ''[[Financial Times]]'', in 1988 [[Yasser Arafat]] declared that the Palestinians had accepted Israel's right to exist.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=|url=http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/a6fc921c-3386-11d9-b6c3-00000e2511c8.html#axzz1TIo4nrB7 |title=After Arafat, a chance for change |publisher=FT.com |date=2004-11-11 |accessdate=2012-01-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1993, there was an official exchange of letters between Israeli Prime Minister [[Yitzhak Rabin]] and Chairman Arafat, in which Arafat declared that "the PLO affirms that those articles of the Palestinian Covenant which deny Israel's right to exist, and the provisions of the Covenant which are inconsistent with the commitments of this letter are now inoperative and no longer valid."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://archive.adl.org/backgrounders/revision_of_plo_covenant.html#.WGSFAHpo-G8|title=You are being redirected...|website=archive.adl.org|access-date=2017-05-22|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170501153721/http://archive.adl.org/backgrounders/revision_of_plo_covenant.html#.WGSFAHpo-G8|archive-date=2017-05-01|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2009 Prime Minister [[Ehud Olmert]] demanded the [[Palestinian Authority]]'s acceptance of Israel's right to exist as a [[Jewish state]], which the Palestinian Authority rejected.&lt;ref name="Ronen, Gil, "&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.israelnationalnews.com/News/News.aspx/124218|title=Olmert to Demand PA Accept Israel as Jewish State|website=Israel National News}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Knesset plenum gave initial approval in May 2009 to a bill criminalising the public denial of Israel's right to exist as a [[Jewish state]], with a penalty of up to a year in prison.&lt;ref name="haaretz.com"&gt;Shragai, Nadav, "[http://www.haaretz.com/hasen/spages/1088712.html Knesset okays initial bill to outlaw denial of 'Jewish state']", ''Haaretz'', May 30, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2011, the PA Ambassador to India, Adli Sadeq, wrote in the official PA daily: "They [Israelis] have a common mistake or misconception by which they fool themselves, assuming that Fatah accepts them and recognizes the right of their state to exist, and that it is Hamas alone that loathes them and does not recognize the right of this state to exist. They ignore the fact that this state, based on a fabricated [Zionist] enterprise, never had any shred of a right to exist."&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Al-Hayat Al-Jadida, November 26, 2011&lt;/ref&gt;  In a different part of the article the PA ambassador explained this explicitly: "There are no two Palestinians who disagree over the fact that Israel exists, and recognition of it is restating the obvious. But recognition of its right to exist is something else, different from recognition of its [physical] existence."&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

In 2011 Palestinian President [[Mahmoud Abbas]] said in a speech to the Dutch Parliament that the Palestinian people recognise Israel's right to exist and they hope the Israeli government will respond by "recognizing the Palestinian state on the borders of the land occupied in 1967."

John V. Whitbeck argued that Israel's insistence on a right to exist forces Palestinians to provide a moral justification for their own suffering.&lt;ref name="Whitbeck"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.csmonitor.com/2007/0202/p09s02-coop.html |title=What 'Israel's right to exist' means to Palestinians |last=Whitbeck |first=John V. |date=February 2, 2007 |publisher=The Christian Science Monitor|accessdate=2009-05-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Noam Chomsky]] has argued that no state has the right to exist, that the concept was invented in the 1970s, and that Israel's right to exist can not be accepted by the Palestinians.&lt;ref&gt;[https://chomsky.info/200506__/ On the Future of Democracy Noam Chomsky interviewed by John P.

International law scholar [[Anthony Carty]] observed in 2013 that “the question whether Israel has a legal right to exist might appear to be one of the most emotively charged in the vocabulary of international law and politics. It evokes immediately the ‘exterminationist’ rhetoric of numerous Arab and Islamic politicians and ideologues, not least the [[Mahmoud Ahmadinejad|present President of Iran]]."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Carty|first1=Anthony|journal=The Modern Law Review|date=January 2013|volume=76|issue=1|pages=158–177}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Novorossiya===
Supporters of an [[Novorossiya (confederation)|autonomous Novorossiya]] in eastern [[Ukraine]] equally argue for a Novorossiyan right to exist. Due to ongoing media controversy around the driving forces behind the [[2014 pro-Russian unrest in Ukraine|unrest in Ukraine]], however, the term carries significant weight. [[RT News]] reported in December 2014 that Soika, a self-professed 23-year old Slovak volunteer who had then been in [[Donbass]] for two months, told them: "Novorossiya has the right to exist. Although Europe declares the rights of peoples, it recognizes them in a selective manner."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rt.com/op-edge/211703-donbass-west-war-europe-clashes/ What brings prosperous Westerners to join E.

===North Korea===
In the context of [[South Korea]]'s and the [[United States]] non-recognition of the North Korean state and what the North views as a 'hostile policy' pursued by the US, the North's government frequently accuses the US of denying the 'right of existence' of North Korea. For instance, a 2017 Foreign Ministry statement declared, "The DPRK will redouble the efforts to increase its strength to safeguard the country’s sovereignty and right to existence." North Korea itself does not recognise the right of existence of the Republic of Korea in the south. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.news.com.au/technology/innovation/north-korea-threatens-to-reduce-us-to-ashes/news-story/d735f25866cc4b089fad03865908dc91|title=Just what is North Korea up to now?|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===[[State of Palestine]]===
{{see also||History of the State of Palestine|History of Palestine}}
The [[League of Nations]] formally awarded Britain a mandate over [[Mandatory Palestine]] in 1922, when Jews made up 11% of the population.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://ecf.org.il/issues/issue/1087|title=1922 Census of Palestine|first=ECF|last=Database|website=ecf.org.il}}&lt;/ref&gt; The land west of the Jordan River was under direct British administration until 1948, while the land east of the Jordan was a semi-autonomous region known as Transjordan Emirate, and gained independence in 1946. 
In 1936-39 there was a [[1936–1939 Arab revolt in Palestine|nationalist uprising]] by Palestinian Arabs against British colonial rule and [[Chronology of Aliyah in modern times|mass Jewish immigration into Palestine]].

In 1947, a [[United Nations]] General Assembly resolution provided for the creation of an "Arab State" and a "Jewish State" to exist within Palestine in the [[United Nations Partition Plan for Palestine]]. This has been described by Prof. [[Joseph Massad]] as "a non-binding proposal that was never ratified or adopted by the Security Council, and therefore never acquired legal standing, as UN regulations require."&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt; The [[Jewish Agency]], precursor to the Israeli government, agreed to the plan, but the Palestinians rejected this and fighting broke out. After Israel's May 14, 1948 unilateral [[Israeli declaration of independence|declaration of independence]], support from neighboring Arab states escalated the [[1947–48 Civil War in Mandatory Palestine]] into the [[1948 Arab-Israeli War]]. The legal and territorial status of Israel and Palestine is still hotly disputed in the region and within the international community.

In June 2009 [[Barack Obama]] said "Israelis must acknowledge that just as Israel's right to exist cannot be denied, neither can Palestine's."&lt;ref name="bbc- obama"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/8083107.stm |title=Middle East &amp;#124; Obama on Israeli-Palestinian 'stalemate' |publisher=BBC News |date=2009-06-04 |accessdate=2012-01-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As reported by ''[[The New York Times]]'', in 1988 [[Yasser Arafat]] declared that the Palestinians accepted [[United Nations Security Council Resolution 242|United Nations Security Council Resolutions 242]] and [[United Nations Security Council Resolution 338|338]], which would guarantee ''"the right to exist in peace and security for all".''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=PAUL LEWIS |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1988/12/14/world/arafat-in-geneva-calls-on-israelis-to-join-in-talks.html?src=pm |title=ARAFAT, IN GENEVA, CALLS ON ISRAELIS TO JOIN IN TALKS |publisher=New York Times |date=1988-12-14 |accessdate=2012-10-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1993, there was an official exchange of letters between Israeli Prime Minister [[Yitzhak Rabin]] and Chairman Arafat, in which Arafat declared that "the PLO affirms that those articles of the Palestinian Covenant which deny Israel's right to exist, and the provisions of the Covenant which are inconsistent with the commitments of this letter are now inoperative and no longer valid."&lt;ref name="mfa.gov.il"/&gt;However, the actual wording of the revision only stated the provision would be removed at a future date; the non-recognition of Israel remains in the charter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iris.org.il/pncvote.htm|title=Peace Watch: PLO Charter Wasn't Changed|website=www.iris.org.il}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="mfa.gov.il"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mfa.gov.il/MFA/Peace%20Process/Guide%20to%20the%20Peace%20Process/Israel-PLO%20Recognition%20-%20Exchange%20of%20Letters%20betwe|title=Israel-PLO Recognition: Exchange of Letters between PM Rabin and Chairman Arafat|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2009 Prime Minister [[Ehud Olmert]] demanded the [[Palestinian Authority]]'s acceptance of Israel's right to exist as a [[Jewish state]], which the Palestinian Authority rejected.&lt;ref name="Ronen, Gil, "/&gt; The Knesset plenum gave initial approval in May 2009 to a bill criminalizing the public denial of Israel's right to exist as a [[Jewish state]], with a penalty of up to a year in prison.&lt;ref name="haaretz.com"/&gt;

Israeli government ministers [[Naftali Bennett]] and [[Danny Danon]] have repeatedly rejected the [[Proposals for a Palestinian state|creation of a Palestinian state]], with Bennett stating "I will do everything in my power to make sure they never get a state."&lt;ref&gt;David Remnick (21 January 2013), [http://www.newyorker.com/reporting/2013/01/21/130121fa_fact_remnick The settlers move to annex the West Bank—and Israeli politics.] ''[[The New Yorker]]''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-4446604,00.html|title=Bennett: Palestinian state a mistake, will work against it|date=28 October 2013|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bennett stated that "relinquishing control of the West Bank would expose Israel's home front to infiltration tunnels leading into the heartland of Israel," citing the case of Gaza as a scenario that could repeat itself.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jpost.com/Diplomacy-and-Politics/Bennett-If-Israel-leaves-West-Bank-well-have-terror-tunnels-leading-into-our-heartland-370222|title=Bennett: If Israel leaves West Bank, we'll have terror tunnels leading into our heartland|work=Jerusalem Post|date=6 August 2014|accessdate=2 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In an August 2011 interview with Teymoor Nabili on Al Jazeera English, [[Danny Danon]] said "There is place only for one state on the land of Israel....

The '''Silver Branch''' or '''Silver Bough''' ({{Lang-ga|An Craobh Airgid}}) is a symbol found in [[Irish mythology]] and literature.

Featured in the Irish poem [[The Voyage of Bran]], it represents entry into the [[Celtic Otherworld]], which the Welsh called [[Annwn]] and the Irish [[Tír na nÓg]]: "To enter the Otherworld before the appointed hour marked by death, a passport was often necessary, and this was usually a silver branch of the sacred apple-tree bearing blossoms." &lt;ref&gt;Cf. Eleanor Hull, The Silver Bough in Irish Legend, in Folk-Lore, xii.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Extract from Gods of the Celts, published by Dalriada Publications – http://www.manannan.net/library/godofthecelts.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="MacKillop1"&gt;James MacKillop, ''Dictionary of Celtic Mythology'', Oxford, Oxford University Press, 1998, pp.21, 205, 270, 322–3, 346, 359–60. {{ISBN|0-19-280120-1}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The branch is also associated with [[Manannán mac Lir]], an Irish [[water deity|sea deity]] with strong affiliation to Tír na nÓg. As guardian of the Otherworld, Manannán also has strong ties with [[Emhain Abhlach]], the Isle of Apple Trees, where the magical silver apple branch is found. Both the branch and Manannán are featured in ''[[His Three Calls to Cormac]]'', or "[[Cormac mac Airt|Cormac's]] Adventure in the Land of Promise." Here, he appeared at Cormac's ramparts (at [[Tara, Ireland|Tara]]) in the guise of a warrior who told him he came from a land where old age, sickness, death, decay, and falsehood were unknown (Tír na nÓg). The king was given a "branch of silver with three [[golden apple]]s on his shoulder. Delight and amusement to the full was it to listen to the music of that branch, for men sore wounded, or women in child-bed, or folk in sickness, would fall asleep at the melody when that branch was shaken."&lt;ref&gt;This tale exists in several manuscripts of the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries; i. e. Book of Ballymote, and Yellow Book of Lecan, as edited and translated by Stokes, in Irische Texts, III. i. 183–229; cf. Voy. of Bran, i. 190 ff.; cf. Le Cycle Myth.

'''Smart Parks''' is an organisation which focuses on supporting conservation and anti poaching using modern technology.

==History==
Smart Parks  was formed by the merger of two charities [[ShadowView]] and Internet of Life in 2017. The organisation operates as a registered [[Charitable organisation|charity]] in the [[UK]] and a [[Stichting]] with a [[Social Enterprise]] model limited company in the [[Netherlands]]. 
The mission of Smart Parks is to utilise technology to assist in [[Anti-poaching]] and park management across the world. The primary operational focus is to create a network of sensors and technologies that allows permanent live monitoring of assets in the park that is being protected. 
In 2017 Rwanda’s [[Akagera National Park]] launched the Smart Parks technology which allows park rangers to monitor animals, visitors, and equipment in real-time. The Smart Parks system is based on the [[LoRa]] technology a Long Range Wide-Area Network (LoRaWAN) with low-bandwidth, low-power networking technology that can blanket large areas at relatively low costs.&lt;ref name="The Verge"&gt;{{Cite news|title=High Tech plan to combat poachers|url=http://www.theverge.com/2017/7/20/16002752/smart-park-rwanda-akagera-poaching-lorawan.html|publisher=The Verge.com.|date=20 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Operations==
In January 2017 The Internet of Life and the [[ShadowView]] Foundation organisations co-developed a [[LoRa]]-equipped sensor that is implanted directly into a [[rhinoceros]] horn for protection against poaching in [[Akagera National Park]]. The sensor has given park rangers the ability to accurately monitor the whereabouts and activities of the critically endangered black rhinos and keep them safe from wildlife criminals and poachers. The LoRa-equipped tracking sensor is part of a comprehensive LoRaWAN™-based [[Internet of things|IoT]] security solution utilised by Smart Parks&lt;ref name="Park rangers use IoT"&gt;{{Cite news|title=Park rangers use IoT in mission to save endangered black rhinos|url=https://internetofbusiness.com/park-rangers-use-iot-tech-to-save-the-endangered-black-rhino//|publisher=Internet Of Business|date=29 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; that is now being deployed throughout [[Mkomazi National Park]] and many other locations. &lt;ref name="Nasdaq Global Newswire"&gt;{{Cite news|title=Semtech LoRa Technology Tracks Location of Endangered Black Rhinos in Africa|url=https://globenewswire.com/news-release/2017/01/17/906237/0/en/Semtech-LoRa-Technology-Tracks-Location-of-Endangered-Black-Rhinos-in-Africa.html|publisher=GlobeNewswire.com.|date=17 Jan 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

Smart Parks has installed its fourth and largest African smart park to date in Malawi's [[Liwonde National Park]] in October 2018.
In just two weeks, the 548km2 national park was equipped with gateways and sensors that gather information to help improve park management and protection. The construction of the network in the [[Liwonde National Park]] was implemented alongside a team from [[African Parks]], a conservation NGO that manages the park on behalf of the Malawian government. The group was trained by Smart Parks for the construction of the site &lt;ref name="New Smart Park in Africa"&gt;{{Cite news|title=See How This New Smart Park in Africa Could Help Rangers Curb Poaching|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/jenniferhicks/2018/11/07/see-how-this-new-smart-park-in-africa-could-help-rangers-curb-poaching/#138f2f063180|publisher=Forbes.com |date=7 Nov 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;.
Smart Parks announced in 2018 an operation in the [[Serengeti National Park]] a [[World Heritage site]].&lt;ref name="Novel wireless technology"&gt;{{Cite news|title=Serengeti National park|url=https://ensia.com/features/lpwan/|publisher=ensia |date=6 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; .

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3125">'''Spensonia''' is a fictional [[Utopia]]n country&lt;ref&gt;R. C. S. Trahair, ''Utopias and Utopians: An Historical Dictionary'', Westport, CT, Greenwood Publishing, 1999;  pp. 382-3.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ian Tod and Michael Wheeler, ''Utopia: An Illustrated History'', New York, Harmony Books, 1987.&lt;/ref&gt; created by the English author and political reformer [[Thomas Spence]].&lt;ref&gt;P. Mary Ashraf, ''The Life and Times of Thomas Spence'', Newcastle upon Tyne, Frank Graham, 1983.&lt;/ref&gt; Spence laid out his ideas about Spensonia in a series of literary works published in the late 18th century:

* ''A Supplement to the History of Robinson Crusoe'' (1782)
* ''A Marine Republic, or A Description of Spensonia'' (1794)
* ''The Constitution of a Perfect Commonwealth'' (1798)
* ''The Constitution of Spensonia: A Country in Fairyland Situated Between Utopia and Oceana'' (1801)
* ''The Receipt to Make a Millenium or Happy World'' (1805).

Spence issued these works in several editions, creating a complex bibliography. Since he also developed and advocated his own scheme of language reform,&lt;ref&gt;Joan C. Beal, ''English Pronunciation in the Eighteenth Century'', Oxford, Oxford University Press, 2002; pp. 1-12.&lt;/ref&gt; he released his Spensonian works in both standard spelling texts and in his own Spensonian alphabet.

Spence's utopian writings are significant in that he was the first to apply [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] ideas about democracy and majority rule to the genre, and also the first to attempt a utopian response to the [[Industrial Revolution]]. Spence's utopian works "were directed explicitly at the major institutions, economic and political, of the time. In so doing he provided the model of most future utopias."&lt;ref&gt;Lyman Tower Sargent, "Themes in Utopian Fiction in English before Wells," ''Science Fiction Studies'', Vol. 3 No. 3 (November 1976), pp. 275-82; see p. 277.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Plot==
Spence united these utopian writings with a frame story about shipwrecked English mariners. When a ship carrying English merchant brothers is stranded on a remote island, the brothers decide to take the arrangement they had aboard ship, the "Marine Constitution" given to them by their father, and apply it to their life on land; and so they create a commonwealth of collective ownership. The land of the island is the property of the collective, and individuals rent it for their own uses. They organize their own democratic government to manage their new social system.&lt;ref&gt;[[Lewis Mumford]], ''The Story of Utopias'', New York, Boni and Liveright, 1922; Forgotten Books, 2008; pp. 81-3.&lt;/ref&gt;

Their society thrives and flourishes. Men and women are equal. Spensonia maintains cordial relations with other republics, and extends political asylum to refugees from tyranny. There is an official religion, a sort of vague [[deism]], though all other religions are tolerated.

News of the island of Spensonia is brought back to England by a figure named Captain Swallow.

==Introduction==
Outcome measures in rehabilitation medicine, are tools used to evaluate the level of [[disability]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Alexander|first=MS|date=2009|title=Outcome measures in spinal cord injury: recent assessments and recommendations for future directions.|url=|journal=Spinal cord|volume=|pages=|doi=10.1038/sc.2009.18|via=|pmc=2722687}}&lt;/ref&gt;  They could be beneficial for physicians to judge the path of patient's recovery, for researchers to compare different management protocols and for politicians in order to find the cost-effectiveness of their decisions.

As an outcome measure specifically designed for [[spinal cord injury]], the '''Spinal Cord Independence Measure''' is a tool that evaluates how much safe, cheap and independent, a patient can do basic [[activities of daily living]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Catz|first=Amiram|date=1997|title=SCIM--spinal cord independence measure:a new disability scale for patients with spinal cord lesions.|url=|journal=Spinal cord|volume=|pages=|doi=10.1038/sj.sc.3100738|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Catz|first=Amiram|date=2007|title=Spinal Cord Independence Measure:comprehensive ability rating scale for the spinal cord lesion patient.|url=|journal=Journal of rehabilitative research|volume=|pages=|doi=10.1682/JRRD.2005.07.0123|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Structure==
The measure consists of 19 items categorized in three subscales:self care, respiration and sphincter management, and mobility.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="71060">The '''spiral of silence theory''' is a [[political science]] and [[mass communication]] theory proposed by the [[Germany|German]] [[political scientist]] [[Elisabeth Noelle-Neumann]], which stipulates that individuals have a fear of [[solitude|isolation]], which results from the idea that a social group or the society in general might isolate, neglect, or exclude members due to the members' opinions. This fear of isolation consequently leads to remaining silent instead of voicing opinions. Media is an important factor that relates to both the dominant idea and people's perception of the dominant idea. The assessment of one's social environment may not always correlate with reality.{{Sfn|Scheufele|2007}}

==Background==
According to Shelly Neill, "Introduced in 1974, the Spiral of Silence Theory [...] explores hypotheses to determine why some groups remain silent while others are more vocal in forums of public disclosure."{{Sfn|Neill|2009|p=42}} The spiral of silence theory suggests that "people who have believed that they hold a minority viewpoint on a public issue will remain in the background where their communication will be restrained; those who believe that they hold a majority viewpoint will be more encouraged to speak."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Introducing Communication Theory: Analysis and Applicatinon|last=West|first=Richard|publisher=McGraw Hill|year=2010|isbn=978-0-07-338507-5|location=New York|pages=411|last2=Turner|first2=Lynn H.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The theory explains the formation of social norms at both the micro and macro level. "As a micro-theory, the spiral of silence examines opinion expression, controlling for people's predispositions – such as fear of isolation, and also demographic variables that have been shown to influence people's willingness to publicly express opinions on issues, such as agricultural biotechnology."{{Sfn|Scheufele|2007}} The spiral of silence occurs on a macro level if more and more members of the perceived minority fall silent. This is when public perceptions of the opinion climate begin to shift.{{Sfn|Scheufele|2007}} "In other words, a person's individual reluctance to express his or her opinion, simply based on perceptions of what everyone else thinks, has important implications at the social level."{{Sfn|Scheufele|2007}} As one opinion gains the interest of the majority, the minority faces threat and fear of isolation from society. As the opinion gains momentum by the majority, the minority continues to be threatened and falls deeper into their silence. It continues until the minority no longer speaks out against it, and the opinion of the perceived majority ultimately becomes a social norm.{{Sfn|Noelle-Neumann|1984}}

===Spiral model===
The spiral model is an analogy used to visually describe the theory. The end of the [[spiral]] refers to the number of people who are not publicly expressing their opinions, due to the fear of isolation. An individual is more likely to go down the spiral if his or her opinion does not conform with the perceived majority opinion.{{Sfn|Noelle-Neumann|1984}} The following steps summarize how the process works:
#We can distinguish between fields where the opinions and attitudes involved are static, and fields where those opinions and attitudes are subject to changes... Where opinions are relatively definite and static – for example, "customs" – one has to express or act according to this opinion in public or run the risk of becoming isolated. In contrast, where opinions are in flux, or disputed, the individual will try to find out which opinion he can express without becoming isolated.
#Individuals who, when observing their environments, notice that their own personal opinion is spreading and is taken over by others, will voice this opinion self-confidently in public. On the other hand, individuals who notice that their own opinions are losing ground will be inclined to adopt a more reserved attitude when expressing their opinions in public.
#It follows from this that, as the representatives of the first opinion talk quite a lot while the representatives of the second opinion remain silent, there is a definite influence on the environment: an opinion that is being reinforced in this way appears stronger than it really is, while an opinion suppressed as described will seem to be weaker than it is in reality.
#The result is a spiral process which prompts other individuals to perceive the changes in opinion and follow suit, until one opinion has become established as the prevailing attitude while the other opinion will be pushed back and rejected by everybody with the exception of the hard core that nevertheless sticks to that opinion.{{Sfn|Noelle-Neumann|1977}}

This is a process of formation, change and reinforcement of public opinion. The tendency of the one to speak up and the other to be silent starts off a spiraling process which increasingly establishes one opinion as the dominant one. Over time, these changing perceptions establish one opinion as predominant one and they change from the liquid state to a solid norm.{{Sfn|Noelle-Neumann|1977}}

Further, Noelle-Neumann describes the spiral of silence as a [[Positive feedback|dynamic process]], in which predictions about public opinion become fact as mass media's coverage of the [[Majoritarianism|majority opinion]] becomes the [[status quo]], and the minority becomes less likely to speak out.{{Sfn|Miller|2005|p=278}}

==Epistemology==
===Public===
Scholars have long argued over the concept of ''public'' within "public opinion". The use of "[[public]]" and "the public" betrays multiple competing meanings.{{Sfn|Noelle-Neumann|1984}} There are three meanings of public. One meaning is the legal sense of public that focuses on openness. For example, a public place or path. A second meaning for the term emphasizes public rights. Lastly, within the phrase public opinion, public is said to have a related but different definition. Public, in this sense, could be characterized as social psychology. Scholars have marveled in amazement at the power public opinion has in making regulations, norms, and moral rules triumph over the individual self without ever troubling legislators, governments or courts for assistance.{{Sfn|Noelle-Neumann|1984}}

===Opinion===
"Common [[Opinion]]" is what the Scottish social philosopher [[David Hume]] called it in his 1739 published work ''[[A Treatise of Human Nature]]''. Agreement and a sense of the common is what lay behind the English and French "opinion."{{Sfn|Noelle-Neumann|1984}} In researching the term opinion, ''meinung'' in German, researchers were led back to [[Plato]]'s ''[[The Republic (Plato)|Republic]]''. In Plato's ''Republic'', a quote from [[Socrates]] conclude that opinion takes the middle position. [[Immanuel Kant]] considered opinion to be an "insufficient judgement, subjectively as well as objectively."{{Sfn|Kant|1781|p=498}} How valuable opinion may be was left out; however, the fact that it is suggested to be unified agreement of a population, or segment of the population, was still considered.{{Sfn|Noelle-Neumann|1984}}

===Public opinion===
The term [[public opinion]] first emerged in France during the eighteenth century. The definition of public opinion has been debated over time. There has not been much progress in locking in one classification of the phrase ''[[public opinion]].'' [[Hermann Oncken]], a German historian, stated &lt;blockquote&gt;Whoever desires to grasp and define the concept of public opinion will recognize quickly that he is dealing with a [[Proteus]], a being that appears simultaneously in a thousand guises, both visible and as a phantom, impotent and surprisingly efficacious, which presents itself in innumerable transformations and is forever slipping through our fingers just as we believe we have a firm grip on it... That which floats and flows cannot be understood by being locked up in a formula... After all, when asked, everyone knows exactly what public opinion means.{{Sfn|Noelle-Neumann|1984}}&lt;/blockquote&gt; It was said to be a "fiction that belonged in a museum of the history of ideas; it could only be of historical interest."{{Sfn|Noelle-Neumann|1984}}

In contradiction to that quote, the term public opinion seemed to not cease. During the early 1970s, Elisabeth Noelle-Neumann was creating the theory of the spiral of silence. She was making an effort to clarify the 1965 finding of which voting intentions would not change but yet expectations that one side would win continued to increase. Noelle-Nuemann began to question if she was indeed grabbing a handle on what public opinion actually was. "The spiral of silence might be one of the forms in which public opinion appeared; it might be a process through which a new, youthful public opinion develops or whereby the transformed meaning of an old opinion spreads."{{Sfn|Noelle-Neumann|1984}}

The American sociologist [[Edward Alsworth Ross|Edward Ross]] described [[public opinion]] in 1898 using the word "cheap". "The equation of 'public opinion' with 'ruling opinion' runs like a common thread through its many definitions. This speaks to the fact that something clinging to public opinion sets up conditions that move individuals to act, even against their own will."&lt;ref name="NoelleBook" /&gt;

Many possible meanings and definitions of the term have been explored. Scholars have considered the content of public opinion, assumed to consist of public affairs issues. Scholars point out that the emergence of the public opinion depends on an open public discourse rather than "on the discipline imposed by an apparent majority dominant enough to intimidate but whose views may or may not support actions that are in the common interest."&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite journal|title=What is this Thing we Call Public Opinion? Reflections on the Spiral of Silence|url=http://ijpor.oxfordjournals.org/content/24/3/368|journal=[[International Journal of Public Opinion Research]]|date=1 September 2012|issn=0954-2892|pages=368–386|volume=24|issue=3|doi=10.1093/ijpor/eds014|language=en|first=Kurt|last=Lang|first2=Gladys Engel|last2=Lang}}&lt;/ref&gt;

They have also considered whose opinion establishes public opinion, assumed to be persons of a community who are ready to express themselves responsibly about questions of public relevance. Scholars have also looked into the forms of public opinion, said to be those that are openly expressed and accessible; opinions that are made public, especially in the mass media. Controversy surrounding this term spiraled around both words combining to form the phrase.{{Sfn|Noelle-Neumann|1984}}

===Media and public opinion===
Mass media's effects on both public opinion and the perception of the public opinion are central to the Spiral of Silence Theory. One of the earliest works that called attention to the relationship between media and the formation of public opinion was [[Walter Lippmann]]'s book "Public Opinion," published in 1923.&lt;ref name="Lippmann"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Lippmann|first1=W|title=Public opinion|date=1946|publisher=Transaction Publishers}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ideas of Lippmann regarding the effects of media influenced the emergence of the Spiral of Silence Theory. As she is building the spiral theory, Noelle-Neumann states "the reader can only complete and explain the world by making use of a consciousness which in large measure has been created by the mass media."&lt;ref name="NoelleBook"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Noelle-Neumann|first1=Elisabeth|title=The spiral of silence: Public opinion, our social skin|date=1993|publisher=University of Chicago Press|location=Chicago}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Agenda-setting theory]] is another work that Noelle-Neumann builds on as she is characterizing media's effect on the public opinion. Agenda-setting theory describes the relationship between media and public opinion by asserting that the public importance of an issue depends on its salience in the media.&lt;ref name="AgendaSetting"&gt;{{cite journal|last2=Shaw|first2=D. L|date=1972|title=The agenda-setting function of mass media|journal=[[Public Opinion Quarterly]]|volume=36|issue=2|pages=176–187|doi=10.1086/267990|last1=McCombs|first1=M. E}}&lt;/ref&gt; Along with setting the agenda, the media further determines the salient issues through a constant battle with other events attempting to gain place in the agenda.&lt;ref name="NoelleBook" /&gt; The media battles with these news alternatives by creating "pseudo-crises" and "pseudo-novelties."&lt;ref name="NoelleBook" /&gt;

Media's characteristics as a communication tool further affect people's perception of their own ideas in regard to the public opinion.&lt;ref name="NoelleBook" /&gt; According to Noelle-Neumann, the media is a "one-sided, indirect, public form of communication, contrasting threefold with the most natural form of human communication, the [[conversation]]."&lt;ref name="NoelleBook" /&gt; These characteristics of the media in particular further overwhelm one's individual ideas.

While some media communication theories assume a passive audience, such as the [[Hypodermic needle model|Hypodermic Needle model]],&lt;ref name="CommChar" /&gt; the spiral model assumes an active audience "who consumes media products in the context of their personal and social goals."&lt;ref name="CommChar"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Ball-Rokeach|first1=S|last2=Cantor|first2=M. G|title=Media, audience, and social structure|date=1986|publisher=Sage Publications, Inc.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Knowledge "gained from the mass media may offer ammunition for people to express their opinions and offer a rationale for their own stance."&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite journal|title=The spiral of silence: examining how cultural predispositions, news attention, and opinion congruency relate to opinion expression|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1080/01292986.2012.725178|journal=Asian Journal of Communication|date=2013-04-01|issn=0129-2986|pages=113–134|volume=23|issue=2|doi=10.1080/01292986.2012.725178|first=Shirley S.|last=Ho|first2=Vivian Hsueh-Hua|last2=Chen|first3=Clarice C.|last3=Sim}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ho et al. point out that "among individuals who paid high amount of media attention, those who have a low fear of isolation were significantly more likely to offer a rationale for their own opinion than were those who have a high fear of isolation."&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

Noelle-Neuman regards media central to the formulation of the Spiral of Silence Theory, whereas some scholars argue whether the dominant idea in one's social environment overwhelms the dominant idea that media proposes as the perceived social norm.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Glynn|first1=C. J|last2=McLeod|first2=J.M|title=Implications of the spiral of silence theory for communication and public opinion research|journal=Political communication yearbook|date=1984|pages=43–65}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Kennamer"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Kennamer|first1=J.D|title=Self-serving biases in perceiving the opinions of others: Implications for the spiral of silence|journal=Communication Research|date=1990|doi=10.1177/009365090017003006|volume=17|issue=3|pages=393–404}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some empirical research align with this perspective; suggesting that the "micro-climate" of an individual overwhelms the effects of the media.&lt;ref name="Kennamer" /&gt; Other articles further suggest that talking with others is the primary way of understanding the opinion climate.&lt;ref name="Talking"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Tichenor|first1=P. J|last2=Wackman|first2=D. B|title=Mass media and community public opinion|journal=American Behavioral Scientist|date=1973|volume=16|issue=4|doi=10.1177/000276427301600408|pages=593–606}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Assumptions==
===Fear of isolation===
The fear of isolation is the centrifugal force that accelerates the spiral of silence.{{Sfn|Griffen|2009}} Essentially, people fear becoming social isolates and thus take measures to avoid such a consequence, as demonstrated by psychologist [[Solomon Asch]] in the [[Asch conformity experiments]].{{Sfn|Cherry|2012}} People feel more comfortable by agreeing with opinions that they know are wrong instead of telling others their ideas.{{Sfn|Scheufele|2007}}

===Assessing the climate===
This assumption proposes that in order to avoid becoming isolated and in order not to lose popularity and esteem, people constantly observe their environment very closely. They try to find out which opinions and modes of behaviour are prevalent, and which opinions and modes of behaviour are becoming more popular. They behave and express themselves accordingly in public. Then, they try to determine whether they are in the majority: whether the public opinion tends to agree with them. If they feel they are in the minority, they tend to remain silent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Weiman|first1=Gabriel|title=Communicating Unreality|date=2000|publisher=Sage Publications, Inc.|location=United States of America|edition=1st}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Quasi-statistical sense====
Individuals use what is described as "an innate ability" or quasi-statistical sense to gauge [[public opinion]].&lt;ref name= "Miller 2005:278"&gt;{{Harvnb|Miller|2005|p=278}}.&lt;/ref&gt; People assume they can sense and figure out what others are thinking.{{Sfn|Scheufele|2007}}
{{Quote|The [[Mass media]] play a large part in determining what the dominant opinion is, since our direct observation is limited to a small percentage of the population. The mass media have an enormous impact on how public opinion is portrayed, and can dramatically impact an individual's perception about where public opinion lies, whether or not that portrayal is factual.{{Sfn|Scheufele|Moy|2000}} }}

====Pluralistic ignorance====
[[Pluralistic ignorance]] may occur in some cases, leading to the minority opinion to be accepted as a norm. Group members may be privately rejecting a norm, but may falsely assume that other group members accept it. This phenomenon may cause a group to hold on to a norm.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Shelton|first1=J. Nicole|title=Intergroup Contact and Pluralistic Ignorance|journal=Journal of Personality and Social Psychology|date=2005|volume=88|issue=1|pages=91–107|doi=10.1037/0022-3514.88.1.91|pmid=15631577}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Evaluation of public opinion matters===
Our evaluation of a public opinion has an effect on our decision to speak up. Where opinions are relatively definite and static – customs, for example – one has to express or act according to this opinion in public or run the risk of becoming isolated. In contrast, where opinions are in flux, or disputed, the individual will try to find out which opinion he can express without becoming isolated. Individuals tend to publicly express their opinions and attitudes when they perceive their view to be dominant or on the rise. Conversely, when individuals perceive that their opinion is less popular or losing popularity, they are less likely to voice it in public. What one individual decides to do affects all of society around them.{{Sfn|Scheufele|2007}}

==Vocal minority and hardcore==
The theory explains a ''vocal minority'' (the complement of the ''[[silent majority]]'') by stating that people who are highly educated, or who have greater affluence, and the few other cavalier individuals who do not fear isolation, are likely to speak out regardless of public opinion.{{Sfn|Miller|2005|p=279}} It further states that this minority is a necessary factor of change while the compliant majority is a necessary factor of stability, with both being a product of evolution. There is a vocal minority, which remains at the top of the spiral in defiance of threats of isolation.

This theory calls these vocal minorities the hardcore nonconformist or the avant-garde. Hardcore nonconformists are "people who have already been rejected for their beliefs and have nothing to lose by speaking out."{{Sfn|Griffen|2009}} The hardcore has the ability to reconfigure majority opinion. While the [[avant-garde]] are "the intellectuals, artists, and reformers in the isolated minority who speak out because they are convinced they are ahead of the times."{{Sfn|Griffen|2009}}

==Application of the theory==
The spiral of silence has brought insight regarding diverse topics, ranging from speaking about popular culture phenomena,&lt;ref name=PopCulture&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Wedel|first1=T|title=The spiral of silence in popular culture: applying a public opinion theory to radio station popularity|journal=California State University|date=1994}}&lt;/ref&gt; to smoking.{{Sfn|Shanahan|Scheufele|Yang|Hizi|2004}} Considering that the spiral of silence is more likely to occur in controversial issues and issues with a moral component,&lt;ref name=NoelleBook /&gt; many scholars have applied the theory to controversial topics, such as [[abortion]],&lt;ref name=SpiralOnAbortion&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Salmon|first1=C.T|last2=Neuwirth|first2=k|title=Perceptions of opinion "climates" and willingness to discuss the issue of abortion|journal=Journalism &amp; Mass Communication Quarterly|date=1990|volume=67|issue=3|pages=567–577|doi=10.1177/107769909006700312}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[affirmative action]],&lt;ref name=SpiralOnAffirmative&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Moy|first1=P|last2=Domke|first2=D|last3=Stamm|first3=K|title=The spiral of silence and public opinion on affirmative action|journal=Journalism &amp; Mass Communication Quarterly|date=2001|volume=78|issue=1|pages=7–25|doi=10.1177/107769900107800102}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[capital punishment]].&lt;ref name=SpiralOnCapital&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hayes|first1=A.F|title=Exploring the Forms of Self-Censorship: On the Spiral of Silence and the Use of Opinion Expression Avoidance Strategies|journal=Journal of Communication|date=2007|volume=57|issue=4|pages=785–802|doi=10.1111/j.1460-2466.2007.00368.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cross cultural studies===
Existing literature prior to the spiral of silence theory suggest a relationship between social [[conformity]] and [[culture]], motivating communication scholars to conduct cross-cultural analysis of the theory. Scholars in the field of [[psychology]] in particular previously addressed the cultural variance involved in the conformity to the majority opinion.&lt;ref name=Milgram&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Milgram|first1=S|title=Nationality and conformity|journal=Scientific American|date=1961|doi=10.1038/scientificamerican1261-45|volume=205|issue=6|pages=45–51}}&lt;/ref&gt; More recent studies confirm the link between conformity and culture: a [[meta-analysis]] regarding [[Asch conformity experiments]], for example, suggest that [[Collectivism|collectivist]] cultures are more likely to exhibit conformity than the individualistic cultures.&lt;ref name=MetaAsch&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Bond|first1=Rod|last2=Smith|first2=Peter B.|title=Culture and conformity: A meta-analysis of studies using Asch's (1952b, 1956) line judgment task.|journal=Psychological Bulletin|date=1996|volume=119|issue=1|pages=111–137|doi=10.1037/0033-2909.119.1.111}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====The United States and Taiwan====
''A Cross Cultural Test of the Spiral of Silence'' by Huiping Huang analyzes the results of a telephone survey done in Taiwan and the United States. The hypotheses tested were the beliefs that the United States is [[individualistic culture|an "individualistic" society]], while Taiwan is a "[[collectivist]]" society. This suggested that the spiral of silence is less likely to be activated in the United States, because individuals are more likely to put emphasis on their personal goals. They put the "I" identity over the "we" identity, and strive for personal success. Therefore, it was hypothesized that they would be more likely to speak out, regardless of if they are in the minority. On the other hand, it was predicted that individuals in Taiwan put more emphasis on the collective goal, so they would conform to the majority influence in hopes of avoiding tension and conflict. The study also tested the effect of motives, including [[self-efficacy]] and [[self-assurance]].

Telephone surveys were conducted; the citizens of the United States were questioned in regards to American involvement in [[Somalia]], and the citizens of Taiwan about the possibility of a direct presidential election. Both issues focused on politics and human rights, and were therefore comparable. Respondents were asked to choose "favor," "neutral" or "oppose" in regards to the categories of themselves, family and friends, the media, society, and society in the future about the given issue. Measurements were also taken regarding the [[individualism]] and collectivism constructs, and the "motives of not expressing opinion" based on a 1–10 and 1–5 scale respectively, in approval of given statements.

Results showed support for the original hypothesis. Overall, Americans were more likely to speak out than Taiwanese. Being incongruous with the majority lessened the motivation of the Taiwanese to speak out (and they had a higher collectivist score), but had little effect on the Americans. In Taiwan, future support and belief of society played a large role in likeliness to voice an opinion, and support that the activation of the spiral of silence is in effect. In the United States, it was hypothesized that because they were more individualistic, they would be more likely to speak out if in the minority, or incongruous group. However, this was not true, but Huang suggests that perhaps the issue chosen was not directly prevalent, and therefore, they found it "unnecessary to voice their objections to the majority opinion." Lack of self-efficacy led to lack of speaking out in both countries.{{Sfn|Huang|2005}}

====Basque nationalism====
''Basque Nationalism and the Spiral of Silence'' is an article by Spencer and Croucher that analyzes the public perception of [[ETA (separatist group)|ETA]] (Euskadi Ta Askatasuna, a militant separatist group) in Spain and France. This study was conducted in a similar way as above, with Basque individuals from Spain and France being questioned about their support of ETA. They were asked questions such as "How likely would you be to enter into a conversation with a stranger on a train about ETA?" Taken into consideration were the cultural differences of the two different regions in which ETA existed.

The results supported the theory of the spiral of silence. While there was a highly unfavorable opinion of the group, there was a lack of an outcry to stop it. Individuals claimed that they were more likely to voice their opinions to non-Basques, suggesting that they have a "fear of isolation" in regards to fellow [[Basques]]. Furthermore, the Spanish individuals questioned were more likely to be silent because of their greater proximity to the violent acts.{{Sfn|Spencer|Stephen|2008}}

===Perceptions in the classroom===
One study, by Henson and Denker "investigates perceptions of silencing behaviors, [[political affiliation]], and political differences as correlates to perceptions of university [[classroom climate]]s and [[communication behavior]]s."{{Sfn|Henson|Denker|2007}} They looked at whether students' view of the classroom changes whether they perceive the instructor and other classmates with a different political affiliation, with the instructor and other classmates communicating using silencing behaviors. The article stated that little has been investigated into student-teacher interactions in the classroom, and how the students are influenced.{{Sfn|Henson|Denker|2007}} The goal of the article was to "determine how political ideas are expressed in the university classrooms, and thus, assess the influence of classroom communication on the perceptions of political tolerance."{{Sfn|Henson|Denker|2007}}

The article claimed that university classrooms are an adequate place to scrutinize the spiral of silence theory because it is a place that has [[interpersonal communication|interpersonal]], [[cultural communication|cultural]], [[media (communication)|media]], and [[political communication]]. Henson and Denker said, "Because classroom interactions and societal discourse are mutually influential, instructors and students bring their own biases and cultural perspectives into the classroom."{{Sfn|Henson|Denker|2007}}

The study researched whether there was a correlation between students' perception that they were being politically silenced and their perceived differences in student-instructor political affiliation. The study also questioned whether there was any connection between the perceived climate and the similarity of the student and instructor on their political affiliations.{{Sfn|Henson|Denker|2007}} The researchers used participants from a Midwestern university's communication courses. The students answered a survey over their perceptions of political silencing, classroom climate, and the climate created by the instructor. The results of this research found that there is a positive relationship of the perceived similarities in political party and [[political ideology|ideological]] differences of the student and instructor to perceived greater political silencing.{{Sfn|Henson|Denker|2007}}

===In computer-mediated communication===
While the studies regarding the spiral of silence theory focused on [[face-to-face interaction]] before 2000, the theory was later applied to a [[computer-mediated communication]] environment. The first study in this context analyzed communication behaviors in online chat rooms regarding the issue of abortion, and revealed that minority opinion holders were more likely to speak out, whereas their comments remained neutral.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=McDevitt|first1=M.|title=Spiral of Moderation: Opinion Expression in Computer-Mediated Discussion|journal=[[International Journal of Public Opinion Research]]|date=1 December 2003|volume=15|issue=4|pages=454–470|doi=10.1093/ijpor/15.4.454}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another study focused on the Korean bulletin board postings regarding the national election, and found a relationship between online postings and the presentation of candidates in the mainstream media.&lt;ref name=OnlineKorea&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Jung Choi|first1=Yun|last2=Lee|first2=Cheolhan|last3=Hyuk Lee|first3=Jong|title=Influence of poll results on the advocates' political discourse: An application of functional analysis debates to online messages in the 2002 Korean presidential election|journal=Asian Journal of Communication|date=March 2004|volume=14|issue=1|pages=95–110|doi=10.1080/0129298042000195189}}&lt;/ref&gt; The third study focuses on the online review system, suggesting that the fear of isolation tend to reduce the willingness of members to voice neutral and negative reviews.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite journal|title=Silence in the crowd: The spiral of silence contributing to the positive bias of opinions in an online review system|url=http://nms.sagepub.com/content/17/11/1811|journal=[[New Media &amp; Society]]|date=1 December 2015|issn=1461-4448|pages=1811–1829|volume=17|issue=11|doi=10.1177/1461444814535190|language=en|first=David A.|last=Askay}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Spiral of Silence Theory is extended "into the context of non-anonymous multichannel communication platforms" and "the need to consider the role of communicative affordances in online opinion expression" is also addressed.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

===In social media contexts===
Current literature suggests that the spiral model can be applied to the [[social media]] context. Gearhart and Zhang conduct a study to examine whether or not the use of social media will increase people's motivation to express their opinions about political issues. The results suggest that social media users "who have received a strong negative reaction to their politically related posts are likely to censor themselves, exemplifying the spiral of silence effect".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title="Was It Something I Said?" "No, It Was Something You Posted!"

===Social capital===
The spiral of silence theory can be also applied to [[social capital]] context. Recent studies see social capital as "a variable that enables citizens to develop norms of trust and reciprocity, which are necessary for successful engagement in collective activities".&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|url=|title=Social Capital and the Spiral of Silence|last=Dalisay|first=Francis|date=2012|journal=[[International Journal of Public Opinion Research]]|doi=10.1093/ijpor/eds023|pmid=|accessdate=|last2=Hmielowski|first2=Jay D.|last3=Kushin|first3=Matthew James|last4=Yamamoto|first4=Masahiro|volume=24|issue=3|pages=325–345}}&lt;/ref&gt; One study examines three individual-level indicators of social capital--[[civic engagement]], trust and neighborliness, and the relationship between these indicators and people's willingness to express their opinions and their perception of support for one's opinions. The results suggest that civic engagement has a direct effect on people's willingness to express their opinions and neighborliness and trust had direct positive effects on people's perception of support for one's opinions.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Also, the study shows that "only a direct (but not indirect) effect of civic engagement on opinion expression further highlights a potential difference between bonding and bridging social capital".&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==Internet==
===Isolating the factors that remove isolation===
The concept of isolation has a variety of definitions, dependent upon the circumstances it is investigated in. In one instance the problem of isolation has been defined as [[social withdrawal]], defined as low relative frequencies of peer interaction.{{Sfn|O'Connor|1969}}{{Sfn|O'Connor|1972}} Other researchers have defined isolation as low levels of peer acceptance or high levels of [[peer rejection]].{{Sfn|Gottman|Gonso|Rasmussen|1975}} Research that considers isolation with regard to the Internet either focuses on how the Internet makes individuals more isolated from society by cutting off their contact from live human beings{{Sfn|Kraut|Patterson|Lundmark|Kiesler|1998}}{{Sfn|Moody|2001}}{{Sfn|Sleek|1998}} or how the Internet decreases [[social isolation]] of people by allowing them to expand their [[social network]]s and giving them more means to stay in touch with friends and family.{{Sfn|Morris|Ogan|2002}}{{Sfn|Bradley|Poppen|2003}} Since the development of the Internet, and in particular the [[World Wide Web]], a wide variety of groups have come into existence, including Web and [[Internet Relay Chat]] (IRC), [[newsgroup]]s, multiuser dimensions (MUDs), and, more recently, commercial [[virtual communities]].{{Sfn|Sassenberg|2002}} The theories and hypotheses about how [[Internet]]-based groups impact individuals are numerous and wide-ranging. Some researchers view these fast growing virtual chat cliques, [[online game]]s, or computer-based marketplaces as a new opportunity, particularly for stigmatized people, to take a more active part in social life.{{Sfn|Rheingold|1993}}{{Sfn|Cummings|Sproull|Kiesler|2002}}{{Sfn|McKenna|Bargh|1998}}

Traditionally, social isolation has been represented as a one-dimensional construct organized around the notion of a person's position outside the [[peer group]] and refers to isolation from the group as a result of being excluded from the group by peers.{{Sfn|Bowker|Bukowski|Zargarpour|Hoza|1998}} From children to adults, literature shows that people understand the concept of isolation and fear the repercussions of being isolated from groups of which they are a member. Fearing isolation, people did not feel free to speak up if they feel they hold dissenting views, which means people restrict themselves to having conversation with like-minded individuals, or have no conversation whatsoever.{{Sfn|Witschge|2002}} Witschge further explained, "Whether it is fear of harming others, or fear to get harmed oneself, there are factors that inhibit people from speaking freely, and which thus results in a non-ideal type of discussion, as it hinders diversity and equality of participants and viewpoints to arise fully."{{Sfn|Witschge|2002|p=8}}

The medium of the Internet has the power to free people from the fear of social isolation, and in doing so, shuts down the spiral of silence. The Internet allows people to find a place where they can find groups of people with like mindsets and similar points of view. Van Alstyne and Brynjolfsson stated that "Internet users can seek out interactions with like-minded individuals who have similar values, and thus become less likely to trust important decisions to people whose values differ from their own."{{Sfn|van Alstyne|Brynjolfsson|1996|p=24}} The features of the Internet could not only bring about more people to deliberate by freeing people of psychological barriers, but also bring new possibilities in that it "makes manageable large-scale, [[many-to-many]] discussion and deliberation."{{Sfn|Coleman|Gøtze|2001|p=17}} Unlike [[traditional media]] that limit participation, the Internet brings the characteristics of empowerment, enormous scales of available information, specific audiences can be targeted effectively and people can be brought together through the medium.{{Sfn|O'Hara|2002}}

===Online versus offline===
The Internet is a place where many [[reference group|reference]] and [[social group]]s are available with similar views. It has become a place where it appears that people have less of a fear of isolation. One research article examined individuals' willingness to speak their opinion online and offline. Through survey results, from 305 participants, a comparison and contrast of online and offline spiral of silence behaviors was determined.{{Sfn|Liu|Fahmy|2009|p=36}} Liu and Fahmy stated that "it is easy to quit from an online discussion without the pressure of complying with the majority group."{{Sfn|Liu|Fahmy|2009}} This is not to say that a spiral of silence does not occur in an online environment. People are still less likely to speak out, even in an online setting, when there is a dominant opinion that differs from their own.{{Sfn|Liu|Fahmy|2009}} But people in the online environment will speak up if someone has a reference group that speaks up for them.{{Sfn|Liu|Fahmy|2009}} In an online situation, just having one person be there to encourage a minority point of view can put an end to a spiral of silence. Another reason for why the spiral of silence theory has less of an effect online could be that studies do not acknowledge whether the person is more likely to speak out against dominant views offline as well.{{Sfn|Liu|Fahmy|2009}} The person might have characteristics that make him comfortable speaking out against dominant views offline, which make them just as comfortable speaking out in an online setting. Even though research suggests that there is a chance people will speak out with their opinions more often in an online setting, silencing of views can still occur. Another research article examined the influence of different opinion climates in [[online forum]]s (opinion congruence with the majority of forum participants vs. website source) and found personal opinion congruence was more influential than the online site in which the forum is situated in.&lt;ref name="JMCQ2013"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Nekmat|author2=Gonzenbach|journal=JMCQ|year=2013|volume=90|issue=4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gonzenbach and Nekmat said it might be worth researching whether the factors in these studies or other factors cause people to be more comfortable when it comes to speaking their mind while online.&lt;ref name="JMCQ2013"/&gt;

===Heterogeneity and anonymity===
The nature of the Internet facilitates not only the participation of more people, but also a more heterogeneous group of people. Page stated, "The onward rush of electronic communications technology will presumably increase the diversity of available ideas and the speed and ease with which they fly about and compete with each other."{{Sfn|Page|1996|p=124}} The reason people engage in deliberations is because of their differences, and the Internet allows differences to be easily found. The Internet seems the perfect place to find different views of a very diverse group of people who are at the same time open to such difference and disagreement needed for deliberation. Noelle-Neumann's initial idea of cowering and muted citizens is difficult to reconcile with empirical studies documenting uninhibited discussion in computer-mediated contexts such as [[chat room]]s and newsgroups.{{Sfn|Wanta|Dimitrova|2000}}{{Sfn|O'Sullivan|1995}}{{Sfn|Sproull|Kiesler|1992}}{{Sfn|Hiltz|Johnson|Turoff|1986}}

The Internet provides an anonymous setting, and it can be argued that in an anonymous setting, fears of isolation and humiliation would be reduced. Wallace recognized that when people believe their actions cannot be attributed to them personally, they tend to become less inhibited by [[Convention (norm)|social conventions]] and restraints. This can be very positive, particularly when people are offered the opportunity to discuss difficult personal issues under conditions in which they feel safer.{{Sfn|Wallace|1999|pp=124–25}}

The groups' ability to taunt an individual is lessened on the Internet,{{citation needed|date=October 2014}} thus reducing the tendency to conform. Wallace goes on to summarize a number of empirical studies that do find that dissenters feel more liberated to express their views online than offline, which might result from the fact that the person in the minority would not have to endure taunts or ridicule from people that are making up the majority, or be made to feel uncomfortable for having a different opinion.{{Sfn|Wallace|1999}} Stromer-Galley considered that "an absence of [[Nonverbal communication|non-verbal]] cues, which leads to a lowered sense of social presence, and a heightened sense of anonymity" frees people from the psychological barriers that keep them from engaging in a face-to-face deliberation.{{Sfn|Stromer-Galley|2002|p=35}}

The crux of the spiral of silence is that people believe consciously or subconsciously that the expression of unpopular opinions will lead to negative repercussions. These beliefs may not exist on the Internet for several reasons. First, embarrassment and humiliation depends on the physical presence of others.{{citation needed|date=October 2014}} In [[computer-mediated communication]], physical isolation often already exists and poses no further threat.{{Sfn|McDevitt|Kiousis|Wahl-Jorgensen|2003}} Second, a great deal of [[normative influence]] is communicated through nonverbal cues, such as [[eye contact]] and [[gestures]],{{Sfn|Burgoon|Buller|Woodall|1989}} but computer-mediated communication typically precludes many of these cues. Third, Keisler, Siegel, and McQuire observe that nonverbal [[social context]] cues convey formality and status inequality in [[face-to-face communication]].{{Sfn|Keisler|Siegel|McQuire|1984}} When these cues are removed, the importance of [[social status]] as a source of influence recedes. Group hierarchies that develop in face-to-face interaction emerge less clearly in a mediated environment.{{Sfn|Williams|1977}} The form and consequences of [[conformity]] influence should undergo significant changes given the interposition of a medium that reduces the [[social presence]] of participants.{{Sfn|McDevitt|Kiousis|Wahl-Jorgensen|2003}} Social presence is defined as the degree of [[salience (language)|salience]] of the other person in the interaction{{Sfn|Short|Williams|Christie|1976}} or the degree to which the medium conveys some of the person's presence.{{Sfn|Rice|Williams|1984}}

===Equality===
An important issue in obtaining heterogeneity in conversation is equal access for all the participants and [[equal opportunities]] to influence in the discussion. When people believe they are ignorant about a topic, incapable to participate in a discussion or not equal to their peers, they tend to not even become involved in a [[deliberation]]. When people do decide to participate, their participation might be overruled by [[pecking order|dominant others]], or their contribution might be valued less or more, depending on their status.{{Sfn|McDevitt|Kiousis|Wahl-Jorgensen|2003}} Dahlberg praises the Internet for its possibility to liberate people from the [[social hierarchies]] and power relations that exist offline: "The 'blindness' of [[cyberspace]] to bodily identity... [is supposed to allow] people to interact as if they were equals. Arguments are said to be assessed by the value of the claims themselves and not the [[social position]] of the poster".{{Sfn|Dahlberg|2001|p=14}}

Gastil sees this feature as one of the strongest points of the Internet: "if computer-mediated interaction can consistently reduce the independent influence of status, it will have a powerful advantage over face-to-face deliberation".{{Sfn|Gastil|2000|p=359}} While status cues are difficult to detect, perceptions about the status converge, and this lessens [[stereotyping]] and [[prejudice]].{{Sfn|Wallace|1999}}

It may be that people do feel more equal in online forums than they feel offline. [[Racism]], [[ageism]], and other kinds of [[discrimination]] against out groups "seems to be diminishing because the cues to [[Outgroup (sociology)|out-group]] status are not as obvious".{{Sfn|Wallace|1999|p=99}} Next to this, the Internet has rapidly and dramatically increased the capacities to develop, [[Information sharing|share]] and [[information organization|organize]] [[information]],{{Sfn|Warren|2001}} realizing more equality of [[information access|access to information]].{{Sfn|Gimmler|2001}}

==Methodological research approaches==
The relationship between the perception of public opinion and willingness to speak-up is mainly measured through [[Opinion poll|survey]]s&lt;ref name=Method&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Neuwirth|first1=K|title=The Spiral of Silence and Fear of Isolation|journal=Journal of Communication|date=2007|volume=57|issue=3|pages=450–468|doi=10.1111/j.1460-2466.2007.00352.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; In surveys, respondents are often asked whether they would reveal their opinions given a hypothetical situation, right after their opinions about the public opinion and their opinion is received. Whether asking hypothetical questions can reflect real life cases was questioned by some communication scholars, leading to a criticism of this [[methodology]] as not being able to capture what the respondent would do in a real-life situation.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{cite journal|title=Real Talk: Manipulating the Dependent Variable in Spiral of Silence Research|journal=Communication Research|date=1 June 2001|volume=28|issue=3|pages=304–324|doi=10.1177/009365001028003003|last1=Scheufele|first1=D. A.|last2=Shanahan|first2=J.|last3=Lee|first3=E.}}&lt;/ref&gt; A research study addressed this criticism by comparatively testing a spiral model both in a hypothetical survey and in a [[focus group]].&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; The findings are in line with the critic of hypothetical survey questions, demonstrating a significant increase in the spiral of silence in focus groups.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

Among different approaches to survey methodology, [[cross-sectional study]] design is the leading method employed to analyze and test the theory.&lt;ref name=Method /&gt; Cross-sectional design involves the analysis of the relationship between public opinion and willingness to speak at one point in time.&lt;ref name="Method" /&gt;

While many of the researchers employ cross-sectional design, some scholars employed [[panel data]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Katz|first1=Cheryl|title=Popularity in a Freefall: Measuring a Spiral of Silence at the End of the Bush Presidency|last2=Baldassare|first2=Mark|journal=[[International Journal of Public Opinion Research]]|date=1994|volume=6|issue=1|pages=1–12|doi=10.1093/ijpor/6.1.1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Under this methodology, three specific approaches have been used. Noelle-Neumann herself tested the theory from the aggregate level. Using this approach, the change process is "observed by comparing the absolute share of people perceiving a majority climate with people willing to express their views over time."&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; The second approach that has been used in Spiral of Silence research is conducting separate regressions for each panel survey wave. The drawback for this approach is that the individual change of climate and opinions perception is ignored.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; The last approach a few scholars used in conducting Spiral of Silence researches is to use changed scores as dependent variables. However, as intuitive as this approach may be, it "leads to well-documented difficulties with respect to statistical properties, such as regression to the mean or the negative correlation of the change score with the time one state".&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

==Criticisms==
The critics of this theory most often claim that individuals have different influences that affect whether they speak out or not.

Research indicates that people fear isolation in their small social circles more than they do in the population at large. Within a large nation, one can always find a group of people who share one's opinions, however people fear isolation from their close family and friends more in theory. Research has demonstrated that this fear of isolation is stronger than the fear of being isolated from the entire public, as it is typically measured.{{Sfn|Moy|Domke|Stamm|2001}}

Scholars have also argued that both personal characteristics and various culture among different groups will have influences on whether a person will willingly speak out. If one person "has a positive self-concept and lacks a sense of shame, that person will speak out regardless of how she or he perceives the climate of public opinion."{{Sfn|Ross|2007}} Another influence critics give for people choosing not to speak out against public opinion is culture. Open expression of ideas is forbidden in some of the cultures.{{Sfn|Ross|2007}} Some cultures are more individualistic, which would support more of an individual's own opinion, while collectivist cultures support the overall group's opinion and needs. Gender can be also considered as a cultural factor. In some cultures, women's "perception of language, not public opinion, forces them to remain quiet."{{Sfn|Ross|2007}} Scheufele &amp; Moy, further assert that certain conflict styles and cultural indicators should be used to understand these differences.{{Sfn|Scheufele|Moy|2000}}

Another criticism of the spiral of silence research is that the research designs do not observe the movement in the spiral over time. Critics propose that Noelle-Neumann's emphasis on time&lt;ref name="NoelleBook" /&gt; in the formation of the spiral should reflect on the methodology as well, and the dynamic nature of the spiral model should be acknowledged. They argue that the spiral of silence theory involves a "time factor", considering that the changes in public opinion eventually lead to change in people's assessments of the public opinion.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Matthes|first1=J.|title=Observing the "Spiral" in the Spiral of Silence|journal=[[International Journal of Public Opinion Research]]|volume=27|issue=2|pages=155–176|date=2014|doi=10.1093/ijpor/edu032}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also, according to Spilchal, the spiral of silence theory "ignores the evidence of the historical development of public opinion, both in theory and practice, through the extension of suffrage, organisation of political propaganda groups, the establishment of pressure groups and political parties, the eligibility of ever wider circles of public officials and, eventually, the installation of several forms of direct democracy."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url=|title=Legacy of Elisabeth Noelle-Neumann: The Spiral of Silence and Other Controversies|last=Splichal|first=Slavko|date=2015|journal=European Journal of Communication|doi=10.1177/0267323115589265|pmid=|access-date =|volume=30|issue=3|pages=353–363}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some scholars also provide understandings of the theory in the contemporary society by pointing out that "it is not so much the actual statistical majority that generates pressure for conformity as it is the climate of opinion conveyed in large measure by the media."&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; Under the great influence by the media coverage, the climate of opinion "is not invariably an accurate reflection of the distribution of opinions within the polity."&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

Further, Scheufele &amp; Moy{{Sfn|Scheufele|Moy|2000}} find problems in the operationalization of key terms, including willingness to speak out. This construct should be measured in terms of actually speaking out, not voting or other conceptually similar constructs. Conformity experiments have no moral component, yet morality is a key construct in the model. These conformity experiments, particularly those by Asch, form part of the base of the theory. Scholars question whether these conformity experiments are relevant to the development of the Spiral of Silence.{{Sfn|Scheufele|Moy|2000}}

===False dilemmas and silence of consistency===
Research indicates that while the existence of groups with other opinions than those that are supposed to be dominant in a society opens a possibility for some people to express some different opinions, fallacy assumptions in such groups that criticism of particular aspects of that group's program is support for society's mainstream views is a source of false dilemmas. This research indicates that such false dilemmas, especially when there are inconsistencies both in mainstream views and in organized opposition views, causes a spiral of silence that specifically silences logically consistent third, fourth or higher number viewpoint criticism. The research in question does not find a solution in many approaches of "recognizing cognitive bias" but instead indicate that such assumptions are part of the problem by promoting the myth of one's own group having overcome its bias by institutional means and allegations of rational critical arguments being due to bias in the minds of critics, citing evolutionary research that shows that not only would any predisposition for justification of views be selected against due to costing nutrients without improving adaptivity of behavior, but that the claim that most adult humans are irrational due to missing stimulation of rationality in early childhood is also evolutionarily indefensible as genes for potential rationality would have been totally eliminated by selection before reaching significant population fraction if they needed a society already promoting rationality to manifest themselves adaptively. The research indicates that humans are not inherently irrational but are forced to pretend irrationality by false dilemmas that claim rational criticism to be justifications for irrational resentment, and suggest that openly expressed rationality can be promoted by discussions in which no exclusion based on traditional political scales or beneficiary classifications exist but all allegations of irrational motives as well as assumptions that some opinions are linked  or that criticism of one view is defence of another specific view are excluded.&lt;ref&gt;Ray Scott Percival (2012). "The Myth of the Closed Mind: Explaining why and how People are Rational".&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Angelo Fusari (2014). "Methodological Misconceptions in the Social Sciences: Rethinking Social Thought and Social Processes".&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''strike''' is a directed physical attack with either a part of the human body or with an inanimate object (such as a [[weapon]]) intended to cause [[blunt trauma]] or [[penetrating trauma]] upon an opponent.

There are many different varieties of strikes. A strike with the hand closed into a fist is called a [[punch (strike)|punch]], a strike with the leg or foot is referred to as a [[kick]] and a strike with the head is called a [[headbutt]]. There are also other variations employed in [[martial arts]] and [[combat sports]].

"Buffet" or "beat" refer to repeatedly and violently striking an opponent; this is also commonly referred to as a combination, or combo, especially in boxing or fighting video games. 
{{Sommaire}}

==Usage==
Strikes  are the key focus of several sports and arts, including [[boxing]], [[savate]], [[karate]], [[muay thai]], [[taekwondo]] and [[wing chun]], some martial arts also use the fingertips, wrists, forearms, shoulders, back and hips to strike an opponent as well as the more conventional fists, palms, elbows, knees and feet that are common in combat sports. Other sports and arts, such as [[wrestling]] employ no strikes in focusing on [[grappling]] techniques.
There is also a form of karate called [[Gōjū-ryū|goju ryu]] which focuses on pressure points (joints) in the legs and arms.

==Hands and arms==
Arm strikes is the act of striking with some part of the palm, knuckle, [[arm]], elbow, or shoulder. This is usually the elbow, the hand, the forearm, or the back of the wrist.

===Open-hand===
{{main article|Open-hand strikes}}

====Palm====
A strike using the [[Hand#Anatomy of the human hand|palm]] of the hand. Whether the hand is open or the fingertips are folded against the bottom knuckles, palm strikes hit with the bottom part of the palm, where the hand meets the wrist.  The hand is held perpendicular to the wrist to avoid hitting the softer inner wrist tissue against the target.

The bottom ridge of the palm is a surprisingly solid striking surface, and can do just as much damage as a closed fist when utilized properly (some studies have shown that a palm strike actually can produce more energy than a punch){{Citation needed|reason=Speculation?|date=January 2010}}, with far less risk of injury to the striker's own hand.

The palm strike is useful as it is thrown in a more relaxed manner than a clenched fist. This is because clenching the fist shortens the extensor muscles of the wrist which counter the action of flexor muscles of the wrist used in punching. Many martial arts teach to keep the fist clench relaxed until impact in order to maximize the speed of the punch.

Targets are numerous and some examples include the [[human nose|nose]], [[jaw]], [[ear]]s, back of the [[Human head|head]], the [[groin]], the [[kidney]]s, the [[Temple (anatomy)|temple]]s and [[abdominal cavity]]. Some combat sports, such as [[Pancrase]], have forbidden strikes using the clenched fist but permitted strikes using the palm.


=====Slap=====
{{main article|Slapping (strike)}}

====Knife hand====
{{main article|Knifehand strike}}
[[File:Shuto.png|thumb|Knife hand]]
A strike using the part of the hand opposite the thumb (from the little finger to the wrist), familiar to many people as a '''karate chop''', ''Shuto'' or ''Tegatana''. This refers to strikes performed with the side of the knuckle of the small finger.

Suitable targets for the knife hand strike include the mastoid muscles of the neck, the jugular, the throat, the collar bones, the 3rd vertebra (key stone of the spinal column), the upper arm, the wrist (knife hand block), the elbow (outside knife hand block), and the knee cap (leg throw).  In many Japanese and Chinese martial arts systems, the knife hand is used to block as well as to strike.
{{clear}}

====Ridge hand====
[[File:Haito.png|right|thumb|Ridge hand]]
By tucking the thumb into the palm, a striking surface called the ridge-hand, or '''reverse knife-hand''' is formed, extending a few inches along the inside of the hand below the first knuckle of the first finger.  Ridge-hand strikes commonly are delivered with a hooking motion, or with a straight arm swinging sideways.

Suitable targets include the mastoid muscles of the neck, the jugular, [[throat]], nose, jaw, the eyes, and the groin. The ridge hand is generally considered obsolete in the martial arts and highly circumstantial {{by whom|date=November 2012}}. The conditioning required to effectively use it is usually better suited towards basic conditioning of other more natural parts of the body, such as punching or kicking{{Citation needed|reason=Speculation?|date=November 2012}}. For example, the buckling that can occur on an unconditioned and sometimes even highly-conditioned fighter when using the technique and slightly missing the main targets (eyes, neck, or nose) can do more damage to the striker, even when he hits decent targets instead, like the jaw or forehead {{Citation needed|reason=Speculation?|date=November 2012}}. As such, it is considered {{by whom|date=November 2012}} a high-level and highly-circumstantial technique in the martial arts that still teach the technique, such as most forms of karate, tae kwon do, jujitsu, and kung fu.
The ridge hand technique is very swift and when mastered can be a formidable technique, it was used successfully by Ian Fergusson (currently 7th degree Tae Kwon Do Master) in the 1981 Tae Kwon Do championships in Argentina earning him an individual Bronze Medal and contributed to the team international Gold Medal.

====Spear hand====
[[File:Nukite.png|thumb|Spear hand]]
Delivered just as with a punch except that the hand is held open like with a knife hand. The intended striking area are the tips of the fingers. The ideal targets are the [[eyes]] and throat. This technique is generally unsuitable against most other targets due to the high probability that one might break their fingers. It does have the added advantage of increasing the range of normal hand striking by 3–4&amp;nbsp;inches or so as opposed to punching, backfisting, or hammer fisting. It is considered a high-level technique requiring enormous conditioning, but even accidental spear fingering can be quite devastating on the eyes such as punching mistakes seen in modern MMA circuits.

===Closed-fist===
====Punch====
{{main article|Punch (combat)}}
A strike utilizing the hand with the fingers closed into a [[fist (hand)|fist]] and striking with the knuckles (as opposed to the hammer fist described below). There are various methods of punches, including but not limited to the straight lead, the backfist, the jab, and the vertical punch.

====Hammerfist====

The hammerfist is a strike with the bottom of a clenched fist, using an action like swinging a hammer, but can also be used horizontally like a backfist strike using the bottom fist.

This strike will not damage the bones of the hands as there is no compression of the knuckles or metacarpals, and there is no leverage to bend the wrist.

The hammerfist strikes cricket ball sized areas on the body, hence is particularly effective for striking the [[Occiput]], the temples, the nose, the mandible, the wrist (for blocking punches), the testicles, the sternum, and the ear (although a cupped hand is more effective). The hammerfist is sometimes used during "[[Mixed martial arts#Ground-and-pound|ground-and-pound]]" striking in mixed martial arts to avoid damaging the bones of the hand.

The hammerfist can also be used to counter grappling charges when the assailant goes low and attempts to grab the defenders legs by giving them a concussion to the back of the head. It is a non-lethal alternative to performing a karate-chop on the assailant's exposed neck.

====Extended knuckle====
[[File:Ippon-Ken.png|thumb|Extended knuckle (Ippon ken)]]
[[File:Nakadaka ken.png|thumb|Extended knuckle (Nakadaka ken)]]
Hand strikes can be delivered with an extended knuckle, rather than the classic fist configuration used for a traditional punch.  One of the fingers is moved forwards so that the impact is made with the knuckle, concentrating force onto a smaller area. This kind of strike is optimized for attacks to [[pressure point]]s.
Deriving from traditional and ancient [[Kung Fu]], such striking was considered high level technique for advanced students/inheritors of the art. The accuracy required alongside the conditioning requirements (similar to the knuckles for traditional punching) put it as a circumstantial technique and not as a standard one.

Some modern martial arts, such as [[Krav Maga]], [[Aikido]], [[Hapkido]], deliver this strike to the back of the hand while being held. It puts pressure on the small bones in the opponent's hand, causing them to loosen up their fingers in the grip. This lets the practitioner transition smoothly into a [[small joint manipulation]] technique. However, its effectiveness after the opponent is reasonably aware of the fight in occurrence has been disputed with evidence hard to obtain due to the nature of the art and its disuse in sport combat sparring or matches.

===Elbow===
{{Main article|Elbow (strike)}}
An elbow strike is any type of attack utilizing the adjoining bones of the [[humerus]] and the [[forearm]]. They can either be linear or circular, and can be used in similar fashion to a standard [[Hook (punch)|hook]], [[uppercut]], or [[Overhand (boxing)|overhand]]. Elbow and knee strikes, especially when delivered from a [[Clinch fighting#Striking techniques|clinch]] are generally associated with the art of [[Muay Thai]]. 
{{clear}}

===Shoulder===
A shoulder strike (also referred to as a shoulder butt) is a strike with the [[anterior]] part of the [[shoulder]]. The shoulder strike can be used against the head of the opponent in close positions such as in a [[Grappling position#Stand-up grappling position|clinch]] or [[ground fighting]], but is generally not considered to have [[knockout power]]. However, as used as a fulcrum for a joint hyperextention, such as an arm lock in classic jujitsu from stand-up or ground positions, can serve well to break said joint either when being the surface that an elbow is slammed upon or as a surface to balance out the break much as the thigh is for the [[juji-gatame]] in [[judo]].

==Feet and legs==

Leg strikes is a physical strike using the ball of the foot, heel, shin, knee or thigh (the latter is also known as a knee strike). This attack is often used in hand-to-hand combat, especially in stand-up fighting.

===Kick===
{{main article|Kick}}

Kicks play a significant role in many forms of martial arts, such as Taekwondo, Karate, [[Kung fu]], [[Vovinam]], [[Kickboxing]], Muay Thai, [[Capoeira]], [[Silat]], and [[Kalarippayattu]].

====Front kick====
{{Main article|Front kick}}

Delivering a front kick involves raising the [[knee]]  and [[foot]] of the striking leg to the desired height, also known as chambering, and extending the leg to contact the target, typically with the upper body straight and balanced. The actual strike is usually delivered by the [[ball of the foot]]. Thrusting one's hips is a common method of increasing both reach and power of the kick; depending on practitioner's particular needs, a front kick may involve more or less body motion. Front kicks are typically aimed at targets below the chest: abdomen, thighs, groin, knees or lower, however advanced practitioner have the capability of striking head-level targets with the front kick.

====Side kick====
The side kick refers to a kick that is delivered sideways in relation to the body of the practitioner. There are two areas that are commonly used as impact points in sidekicks: the heel of the foot and the outer edge of the foot. The heel is more suited to hard targets such as the ribs, stomach, jaw, temple and chest. A sidekick is performed by first chambering the kicking leg diagonally across the body, then extending the leg in a linear fashion toward the target, while flexing the abdominals.

====Roundhouse kick====
{{Main article|Roundhouse kick}}

Also referred to as a ''round kick'', this is the most commonly used kick in [[combat sport]]s due to its power and ease of use.  In most traditional martial arts, the [[Foot#instep|instep]] is used to strike, whereas in Muay Thai, kickboxing and [[mixed martial arts]] the shin is used. To execute, the attacker swings their leg sideways in a circular motion, kicking the opponent's side with the front of the leg, usually with the instep, ball of the foot, toe, or shin. An important variation is the downward roundhouse kick, nicknamed the Brazilian Kick from recent MMA use: A more pronounced twist of the hips allows for a downward end of the trajectory of the kick that is very deceiving.&lt;ref&gt;The Essential Book of Martial Arts Kicks: 89 Kicks from Karate, Taekwondo, Muay Thai, Jeet Kune Do, and Others by Marc De Bremaeker and Roy Faige&lt;/ref&gt;

===Knee===
{{main article|Knee (strike)}}

A knee strike (commonly referred to simply as a knee) is a strike with the [[knee]], either with the [[kneecap]] or the surrounding area. The most common is the straight knee strike, often employed from a [[Clinch fighting#Striking techniques|clinch]] or [[double collar tie]], targeting anywhere from the [[groin]] to the [[Human head|head]]. Variants include the curved knee strike, which is similar to a roundhouse kick, and the jumping or flying knee.

===Stomp===
{{main article|Stomp (strike)}}

==Others==
While less common, other parts of the body are used in specific strikes.

===Bottom===
In a bottom strike, as taught by [[Impact self defense|Impact self-defense]] and other self-defense systems, the defendant drives his or her hips and bottom region backward into an attacker holding them from behind in order to cause the attacker to off-balance and bend forward and possibly cause pain by striking the groin or midsection forcefully. While causing minimal striking damage on average, the attack can serve to develop a superior and/or freed position for the defendant.

===Headbutt===
{{main article|Headbutt}}

A headbutt is a strike with the head, typically involving the use of robust parts of the cranium as areas of impact. Effective headbutting revolves around striking a sensitive area with a less sensitive area, such as striking the nose of an opponent with the forehead. It is known as a risky maneuver: a misplaced headbutt can cause more damage to the person delivering the headbutt than to the person receiving it.

===Hip and shoulder check===
Checking involves striking with the side of the body, at the hip or shoulder, by shifting your balance and pushing with the furthest foot to drive the body into the opponent with force. While these movements are used extensively in [[hockey|ice hockey]] (see [[checking (ice hockey)]]) they can be performed equally well on dry ground and are part of various self-defense techniques. These strikes rarely cause damage, but are used to off-balance or knock an opponent down. However, when applied with ample power and to a vulnerable region they can cause pain, for example, hitting an opponent with the shoulder to the nose, striking the upper [[Quadriceps femoris muscle]] with the hip, or driving the shoulder into the opponent's [[Celiac plexus|solar plexus region]]. 

The use of shoulders can also involve charging at the opponent at running speed, similar to a ram or [[tackle (football move)|tackle]], though a short charge is possible where the attacker simple lunges straight at their opponent with their shoulder. These moves are generally unrefined and unprofessional, since they have a big tendency to miss, rely on brute force more than anything and usually require a run-up. If the charger does hit its intended target however, it can cause both pain and recoil to the target, knocking them over with the striker's [[kinetic energy]] being transferred to them and falling over as a result of the force or pain.

==Principles==
Strikes in Asian martial arts and Western boxing have many of the same principles in common.  These principles apply to strikes with most parts of the human body.  These principles are typically learned by martial artists through multiple repetitions under the supervision of a qualified instructor.  Many martial arts and texts include these principles, such as karate&lt;ref&gt;Funakoshi, Gichin. ''Karate-Do Kyohan: The Master Text''. Tokyo. Kodansha International; 1973.&lt;/ref&gt; and Jeet Kune Do.&lt;ref&gt;Lee, Bruce and Lee, Linda. ''Tao of Jeet Kune Do''. Burbank, CA. O'Hara Publications; 1975.&lt;/ref&gt; This is only a partial list.

# Timing of muscular tension: The striker relaxes to the extent possible during the strike, tensing the muscles of much of the body only at the time of impact, then relaxing again to recoil the striking part.  Relaxation enables the strike to achieve the greatest possible velocity during travel, while rigidity at impact allows the maximum transfer of energy.
# Breath control: Practitioners may include a ''kiai'' or shout, to help tense the muscles at impact and distract or frighten the opponent. Strikers generally exhale as the strike nears the target.  Breath control is also important to relax the body when not attacking; novice strikers often waste significant energy because they are tense at inappropriate times {{Citation needed|reason=Speculation?|date=November 2012}}.
# Penetration: Strikes should aim for a point 4–6&amp;nbsp;inches (10–15&amp;nbsp;cm) behind the target surface, to impart the most energy into the target.  The striker in combat should attempt to strike through the target area, not just contact the surface. An example of increase penetration is in turning the fist as it is thrown, a very natural punching technique that the amount of turn depends on the position be it either as an attack, defense, or counter. Instinctive punching, [[boxing]], along with most martial arts uses this type of punching aside from [[Wing Chun]] and [[Capoeira]] who favor adding slightly more speed at the cost of moderate power loss {{Citation needed|reason=Speculation?|date=November 2012}}.
# Focus: Strikes should channel force through a small area of the attacker's body.  For example, this is the knuckles of the middle finger and index finger during a [[karate]] reverse punch, or the crescent/blade of the foot in a [[Tae Kwon Do]] side kick technique.  Focus helps in achieving proper penetration and in maximizing the damage at the point of impact.
# Kinetic linkage / Summation of force: Muscles are activated in a precise sequence to maximize the force generated. Strikes should generally be thrown with some measure of shifting body weight supporting the blow, as opposed to just the striking arm or leg.  For example, the traditional boxing jab is made more forceful by driving off the rear leg and shifting body weight into the blow, while twisting the trunk and shoulder to further enhance the striking force.
# Footwork: Proper footwork is used to enable the proper balancing of the body, to support combinations of strikes and launch strikes from the proper angle or distance.  This is among the most complex elements of striking, as power ultimately flows from the legs in striking and optimizing the ability to throw combinations involves precise footwork.
# Gravity: Strikes that go from high to low like hammerfists, downwards elbows, and stomp kicks see their force enhanced by gravity.

==Strategies==
Besides applying the mechanical elements described above, strikers use particular strategies to help ensure their strikes are effective. Among these strategies are:

# Combinations: Strikers may combine techniques in a series to ensure one or more strikes impact their opponents.  These attacks are thrown at various targets on the body, with the greatest force typically thrown with a particular technique in the sequence.
# Level of attack: The height of attack is often varied, such as a jab to the head followed by a kick to the ribs.  By varying the level of attack, strikers open the guard of their opponent.
# Timing and Rhythm: Experienced strikers learn through repetition and [[muscle memory]] when (not just how) to launch particular strikes, based on the circumstances they are facing.  Fights and fighters may have ebbs and flows in momentum and action that become predictable.  Disrupting this flow may give the striker an advantage.
# Direct line: "Telegraphing" refers to moving the striking body part prior to actually launching the blow.  Telegraphing signals the intent to the opponent and increases the likelihood the strike will not be effective.  In general, the striking weapon should move first, with the body driving behind it. This requires proper distancing and footwork.
# Deception: Strikers use feints or distractions to disguise the timing or direction of their attacks.  Stomping the foot, noise, frequent hand movement, head movement, switching the guard position, etc. are common feints.  Using feints, then attacking at multiple levels and with various techniques may help deceive the opponent, defeating their guard.
# Dominant angle of attack: Achieving a positional advantage relative to your opponent. [[Ultimate Fighting Championship|UFC]] champion [[Anderson Silva]] wrote: "The ultimate goal in fighting is to utilize footwork to acquire a dominant angle of attack." He defines this as "...a position from which you can strike your opponent, and your opponent is out of position to hit you with a strike...you want your hips facing your opponent and your opponents hips facing away from yours."&lt;ref name="Silva 2007"&gt;{{cite book

==Risks==
The human hand is made up of many small bones which may be damaged by heavy impact. If a hard part of the opponent's body or other hard object is inadvertently struck, the [[metacarpal]]s may splay on impact and break.  [[Boxing|Boxers]] tape their hands so as to hold the metacarpals together and keep them from splaying. One can toughen one's bones by striking objects to induce [[osteoclast]]s (cells which remove bone) and [[osteoblast]]s (which form bone) to remodel the bone over the struck area increasing the density of bone at the striking surface.{{Citation needed|reason=Feb 19, 2008|date=February 2008}}&lt;!-- reference needed, see search pubmed at www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed. --&gt; For more information on bone remodeling, see [[Wolff's law]].

The [[wrist]] must also be kept in proper alignment during a fist strike. If the wrist bends on impact, it can easily be sprained, dislocated or broken. Boxers tape their wrists to reduce wrist flex.

The '''subadditivity effect''' is the tendency to judge [[probability]] of the whole to be less than the probabilities of the parts.&lt;ref name=Baron /&gt;

== Example ==
For instance, subjects in one experiment judged the probability of death from cancer in the United States was 18%, the probability from heart attack was 22%, and the probability of death from "other [[natural causes]]" was 33%. Other participants judged the probability of death from a natural cause was 58%. Natural causes are made up of precisely cancer, heart attack, and "other natural causes," however, the sum of the latter three probabilities was 73%, and not 58%. According to [[Amos Tversky|Tversky]] and Koehler (1994) this kind of result is observed consistently.&lt;ref name="Support Theory" /&gt;

==Explanations==

In a 2012 article in [[Psychological Bulletin]] it is suggested the subadditivity effect can be explained by an [[information-theoretic]] generative mechanism that assumes a noisy conversion of objective evidence (observation) into subjective estimates (judgment).&lt;ref name="HilbertPsychBull" /&gt; This explanation is different than [[support theory]], proposed as an explanation by [[Amos Tversky|Tversky]] and Koehler,&lt;ref name="Support Theory"/&gt; which requires additional assumptions.  Since mental noise is a sufficient explanation that is much simpler and straightforward than any explanation involving heuristics or behavior, [[Occam's razor]] would argue in its favor as the underlying generative mechanism (it is the hypotheses which makes the fewest assumptions).&lt;ref name="HilbertPsychBull"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3533">'''Sustainable product development (SPD)''' is a method for [[product development]] that incorporates a Framework for Strategic Sustainable Development (FSSD), also known as [[The Natural Step]] (TNS) framework. As the demand for products continues to increase around the world and environmental factors like [[climate change]] increasingly affect policies - and thus business - it becomes more and more of a [[competitive advantage]] for businesses to consider [[sustainability]] aspects early on in the [[product development]] process.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Mike Gordon |author2=Chris Musso |author3=Eric Rebentisch |author4=Nisheeth Gupta  |last-author-amp=yes |quote=Businesses with the best product-development track records stand apart from their less-successful peers in three crucial ways|title=The path to successful new products|url=http://www.mckinsey.com/insights/operations/the_path_to_successful_new_products|journal=McKinsey Quarterly|date=January 2010}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

SPD is not limited to the actual product development, but also the product design. Green design which is a part of SPD has two main goals: the prevention of waste and to minimize environmental impact. Environmental impact involves: deforestation, greenhouse gas emissions, and resource/material management, etc. The early stages of design tend to be the areas that effect the environment the worst, the extraction and refining.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Weenen|first=J.C.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2140">In [[mathematics]] &amp;mdash; specifically, in [[large deviations theory]] &amp;mdash; the '''tilted large deviation principle''' is a result that allows one to generate a new [[Rate function|large deviation principle]] from an old one by "tilting", i.e. [[Integral|integration]] against an [[Exponential function|exponential]] [[Functional (mathematics)|functional]].  It can be seen as an alternative formulation of [[Varadhan's lemma]].

==Statement of the theorem==

Let ''X'' be a [[Polish space]] (i.e., a [[separable space|separable]], [[Complete metric space|completely metrizable]] [[topological space]]), and let (''&amp;mu;''&lt;sub&gt;''&amp;epsilon;''&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;''&amp;epsilon;''&amp;gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; be a family of [[Probability space|probability measures]] on ''X'' that satisfies the large deviation principle with [[rate function]] ''I''&amp;nbsp;:&amp;nbsp;''X''&amp;nbsp;&amp;rarr;&amp;nbsp;[0,&amp;nbsp;+&amp;infin;].  Let ''F''&amp;nbsp;:&amp;nbsp;''X''&amp;nbsp;&amp;rarr;&amp;nbsp;'''R''' be a [[continuous function]] that is [[bounded function|bounded]] from above.  For each Borel set ''S''&amp;nbsp;&amp;sube;&amp;nbsp;''X'', let

:&lt;math&gt;J_{\varepsilon} (S) = \int_{S} e^{- F(x) / \varepsilon} \, \mathrm{d} \mu_{\varepsilon} (x)&lt;/math&gt;

and define a new family of probability measures (''&amp;nu;''&lt;sub&gt;''&amp;epsilon;''&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;''&amp;epsilon;''&amp;gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; on ''X'' by

:&lt;math&gt;\nu_{\varepsilon} (S) = \frac{J_{\varepsilon} (S)}{J_{\varepsilon} (X)}.&lt;/math&gt;

Then (''&amp;nu;''&lt;sub&gt;''&amp;epsilon;''&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;''&amp;epsilon;''&amp;gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; satisfies the large deviation principle on ''X'' with rate function ''I''&lt;sup&gt;''F''&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;:&amp;nbsp;''X''&amp;nbsp;&amp;rarr;&amp;nbsp;[0,&amp;nbsp;+&amp;infin;] given by

Historically, the uncertainty principle has been confused&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Furuta|first=Aya|title=One Thing Is Certain: Heisenberg's Uncertainty Principle Is Not Dead|journal=Scientific American|year=2012|url=https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/heisenbergs-uncertainty-principle-is-not-dead/}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Ozawa2003"&gt;{{Citation|last=Ozawa|first=Masanao|title=Universally valid reformulation of the Heisenberg uncertainty principle on noise and disturbance in measurement|journal=Physical Review A|volume=67|year=2003|doi=10.1103/PhysRevA.67.042105|arxiv = quant-ph/0207121 |bibcode = 2003PhRvA..67d2105O|issue=4 |pages=42105}}&lt;/ref&gt; with a somewhat similar effect in [[physics]], called the [[observer effect (physics)|observer effect]], which notes that measurements of certain systems cannot be made without affecting the systems, that is, without changing something in a system. Heisenberg utilized such an observer effect at the quantum level (see below) as a physical "explanation" of quantum uncertainty.&lt;ref&gt;Werner Heisenberg, ''The Physical Principles of the Quantum Theory'', p. 20&lt;/ref&gt; It has since become clearer, however, that the uncertainty principle is inherent in the properties of all [[wave|wave-like systems]],&lt;ref name="Rozema"&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Rozema | first1 = L.

Since the uncertainty principle is such a basic result in quantum mechanics, typical experiments in quantum mechanics routinely observe aspects of it. Certain experiments, however, may deliberately test a particular form of the uncertainty principle as part of their main research program. These include, for example, tests of number–phase uncertainty relations in [[superconductivity|superconducting]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Elion|first=W. J.|author2=M. Matters, U.

[[File:Uncertainty principle.gif|360px|"360px"|right|thumb| Click to see animation. The evolution of an initially very localized gaussian wave function of a free particle in two-dimensional space, with color and intensity indicating phase and amplitude. The spreading of the wave function in all directions shows that the initial momentum has a spread of values, unmodified in time; while the spread in position increases in time: as a result, the uncertainty Δ''x''&amp;nbsp;Δ''p'' increases in time.]]

[[File:Sequential superposition of plane waves.gif|360px|"360px"|right|thumb|The superposition of several plane waves to form a wave packet. This wave packet becomes increasingly localized with the addition of many waves. The Fourier transform is a mathematical operation that separates a wave packet into its individual plane waves. Note that the waves shown here are real for illustrative purposes only, whereas in quantum mechanics the wave function is generally complex.]]

The uncertainty principle is not readily apparent on the macroscopic scales of everyday experience.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Jaeger|first1=Gregg|title=What in the (quantum) world is macroscopic?|journal=American Journal of Physics|date=September 2014|volume=82|issue=9|pages=896–905|doi=10.1119/1.4878358|bibcode = 2014AmJPh..82..896J }}&lt;/ref&gt; So it is helpful to demonstrate how it applies to more easily understood physical situations. Two alternative frameworks for quantum physics offer different explanations for the uncertainty principle. The [[Schrödinger equation|wave mechanics]] picture of the uncertainty principle is more visually intuitive, but the more abstract [[matrix mechanics]] picture formulates it in a way that generalizes more easily.

Mathematically, in wave mechanics, the uncertainty relation between position and momentum arises because the expressions of the wavefunction in the two corresponding [[orthonormal]] [[basis (linear algebra)|bases]] in [[Hilbert space]] are [[Fourier transforms]] of one another (i.e., position and momentum are [[conjugate variables]]). A nonzero function and its Fourier transform cannot both be sharply localized. A similar tradeoff between the variances of Fourier conjugates arises in all systems underlain by Fourier analysis, for example in sound waves: A pure tone is a [[Dirac delta function|sharp spike]] at a single frequency, while its Fourier transform gives the shape of the sound wave in the time domain, which is a completely delocalized sine wave. In quantum mechanics, the two key points are that the position of the particle takes the form of a [[matter wave]], and momentum is its Fourier conjugate, assured by the de Broglie relation {{math|''p'' {{=}} ''ħk''}}, where {{mvar|k}} is the [[wavenumber]].

In [[matrix mechanics]], the [[mathematical formulation of quantum mechanics#Postulates of quantum mechanics|mathematical formulation of quantum mechanics]], any pair of non-[[commutator|commuting]] [[self-adjoint operator]]s representing [[observable]]s are subject to similar uncertainty limits. An eigenstate of an observable represents the state of the wavefunction for a certain measurement value (the eigenvalue). For example, if a measurement of an observable {{mvar|A}} is performed, then the system is in a particular eigenstate {{mvar|Ψ}} of that observable. However, the particular eigenstate of the observable {{mvar|A}} need not be an eigenstate of another observable {{mvar|B}}: If so, then it does not have a unique associated measurement for it, as the system is not in an eigenstate of that observable.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|author1=Claude Cohen-Tannoudji |author2=Bernard Diu |author3=Franck Laloë |title=Quantum mechanics|year=1996|publisher=Wiley|location=Wiley-Interscience|isbn=978-0-471-56952-7|pages=231–233}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the [[Matter wave|de Broglie hypothesis]], every object in the universe is a [[wave]], i.e., a situation which gives rise to this phenomenon. The position of the particle is described by a [[wave function]] &lt;math&gt;\Psi(x,t)&lt;/math&gt;. The time-independent wave function of a single-moded plane wave of wavenumber ''k''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; or momentum ''p''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; is

:&lt;math&gt;\psi(x) \propto e^{ik_0 x} = e^{ip_0 x/\hbar} ~.&lt;/math&gt;

The [[Born rule]] states that this should be interpreted as a [[probability density function|probability density amplitude function]] in the sense that the probability of finding the particle between ''a'' and ''b'' is

:&lt;math&gt; \operatorname P [a \leq X \leq b] = \int_a^b |\psi(x)|^2 \, \mathrm{d}x ~.&lt;/math&gt;

In the case of the single-moded plane wave, &lt;math&gt;|\psi(x)|^2&lt;/math&gt; is a [[uniform distribution (continuous)|uniform distribution]]. In other words, the particle position is extremely uncertain in the sense that it could be essentially anywhere along the wave packet. 

On the other hand, consider a wave function that is a [[superposition principle|sum of many waves]], which we may write this as

:&lt;math&gt;\psi(x) \propto \sum_n A_n e^{i p_n x/\hbar}~, &lt;/math&gt;
where ''A''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; represents the relative contribution of the mode ''p''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; to the overall total. The figures to the right show how with the addition of many plane waves, the wave packet can become more localized. We may take this a step further to the continuum limit, where the wave function is an [[integral]] over all possible modes

:&lt;math&gt;\psi(x) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2 \pi \hbar}} \int_{-\infty}^\infty \varphi(p) \cdot e^{i p x/\hbar} \, dp ~, &lt;/math&gt;

with &lt;math&gt;\varphi(p)&lt;/math&gt; representing the amplitude of these modes and is called the wave function in [[momentum space]]. In mathematical terms, we say that &lt;math&gt;\varphi(p)&lt;/math&gt; is the ''[[Fourier transform]]'' of &lt;math&gt;\psi(x)&lt;/math&gt; and that ''x'' and ''p'' are [[conjugate variables]]. Adding together all of these plane waves comes at a cost, namely the momentum has become less precise, having become a mixture of waves of many different momenta.

One way to quantify the precision of the position and momentum is the [[standard deviation]]&amp;nbsp;''σ''. Since &lt;math&gt;|\psi(x)|^2&lt;/math&gt; is a probability density function for position, we calculate its standard deviation.

The precision of the position is improved, i.e. reduced σ&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;, by using many plane waves, thereby weakening the precision of the momentum, i.e. increased σ&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt;. Another way of stating this is that σ&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt; and σ&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt; have an [[inverse relationship]] or are at least bounded from below. This is the uncertainty principle, the exact limit of which is the Kennard bound. Click the ''show'' button below to see a semi-formal derivation of the Kennard inequality using wave mechanics.

!Proof of the Kennard inequality using wave mechanics
|-
|We are interested in the [[variance]]s of position and momentum, defined as

:&lt;math&gt;\sigma_x^2 = \int_{-\infty}^\infty x^2 \cdot |\psi(x)|^2 \, dx - \left( \int_{-\infty}^\infty x \cdot |\psi(x)|^2 \, dx \right)^2&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\sigma_p^2 = \int_{-\infty}^\infty p^2 \cdot |\varphi(p)|^2 \, dp - \left( \int_{-\infty}^\infty p \cdot |\varphi(p)|^2 \, dp \right)^2~.&lt;/math&gt;

[[Without loss of generality]], we will assume that the [[expected value|means]] vanish, which just amounts to a shift of the origin of our coordinates. (A more general proof that does not make this assumption is given below.) This gives us the simpler form

:&lt;math&gt;\sigma_x^2 = \int_{-\infty}^\infty x^2 \cdot |\psi(x)|^2 \, dx&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\sigma_p^2 = \int_{-\infty}^\infty p^2 \cdot |\varphi(p)|^2 \, dp~.&lt;/math&gt;

The function &lt;math&gt;f(x) = x \cdot \psi(x)&lt;/math&gt; can be interpreted as a [[vector space|vector]] in a [[function space]]. We can define an [[inner product]] for a pair of functions ''u''(''x'') and ''v''(''x'') in this vector space:

:&lt;math&gt;\langle u \mid v \rangle = \int_{-\infty}^\infty u^*(x) \cdot v(x) \, dx,&lt;/math&gt;

where the asterisk denotes the [[complex conjugate]].

With this inner product defined, we note that the variance for position can be written as
: &lt;math&gt;\sigma_x^2 = \int_{-\infty}^\infty |f(x)|^2 \, dx = \langle f \mid f \rangle ~.&lt;/math&gt;

We can repeat this for momentum by interpreting the function &lt;math&gt;\tilde{g}(p)=p \cdot \varphi(p)&lt;/math&gt; as a vector, but we can also take advantage of the fact that &lt;math&gt;\psi(x)&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\varphi(p)&lt;/math&gt; are Fourier transforms of each other. We evaluate the inverse Fourier transform through [[integration by parts]]:

: &lt;math&gt;\begin{align} g(x) &amp;= \frac{1}{\sqrt{2 \pi \hbar}} \cdot \int_{-\infty}^\infty \tilde{g}(p) \cdot e^{ipx/\hbar} \, dp \\
&amp;= \frac{1}{\sqrt{2 \pi \hbar}} \int_{-\infty}^\infty p \cdot \varphi(p) \cdot e^{ipx/\hbar} \, dp \\
&amp;= \frac{1}{2 \pi \hbar} \int_{-\infty}^\infty \left[ p \cdot \int_{-\infty}^\infty \psi(\chi) e^{-ip\chi/\hbar} \, d\chi \right] \cdot e^{ipx/\hbar} \, dp \\
&amp;= \frac{i}{2 \pi} \int_{-\infty}^\infty \left[ \cancel{ \left. \psi(\chi) e^{-ip\chi/\hbar} \right|_{-\infty}^\infty } - \int_{-\infty}^\infty \frac{d\psi(\chi)}{d\chi} e^{-ip\chi/\hbar} \, d\chi \right] \cdot e^{ipx/\hbar} \, dp \\
&amp;= \frac{-i}{2 \pi} \int_{-\infty}^\infty \int_{-\infty}^\infty \frac{d\psi(\chi)}{d\chi} e^{-ip\chi/\hbar} \, d\chi \, e^{ipx/\hbar} \, dp \\
&amp;= \left( -i \hbar \frac{d}{dx} \right) \cdot \psi(x) ,\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;
where the canceled term vanishes because the wave function vanishes at infinity. Often the term &lt;math&gt;-i \hbar \frac{d}{dx}&lt;/math&gt; is called the momentum operator in position space. Applying [[Parseval's theorem]], we see that the variance for momentum can be written as

: &lt;math&gt;\sigma_p^2 = \int_{-\infty}^\infty |\tilde{g}(p)|^2 \, dp = \int_{-\infty}^\infty |g(x)|^2 \, dx = \langle g \mid g \rangle.&lt;/math&gt;

The [[Cauchy–Schwarz inequality]] asserts that
:&lt;math&gt;\sigma_x^2 \sigma_p^2 = \langle f \mid f \rangle \cdot \langle g \mid g \rangle \ge |\langle f \mid g \rangle|^2 ~.&lt;/math&gt;

The modulus squared of any complex number ''z'' can be expressed as
:&lt;math&gt;|z|^{2} = \Big(\text{Re}(z)\Big)^{2}+\Big(\text{Im}(z)\Big)^{2} \geq \Big(\text{Im}(z)\Big)^{2}=\Big(\frac{z-z^{\ast}}{2i}\Big)^{2}. &lt;/math&gt;
we let &lt;math&gt;z=\langle f|g\rangle&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;z^{*}=\langle g\mid f\rangle&lt;/math&gt; and substitute these into the equation above to get

:&lt;math&gt;|\langle f\mid g\rangle|^2 \geq \bigg(\frac{\langle f\mid g\rangle-\langle g \mid f \rangle}{2i}\bigg)^2 ~.&lt;/math&gt;

All that remains is to evaluate these inner products.

: &lt;math&gt;\begin{align}\langle f\mid g\rangle-\langle g\mid f\rangle = {} &amp; \int_{-\infty}^\infty \psi^*(x) \, x \cdot \left(-i \hbar \frac{d}{dx}\right) \, \psi(x) \, dx \\
&amp;{} - \int_{-\infty}^\infty \psi^*(x) \, \left(-i \hbar \frac{d}{dx}\right) \cdot x \, \psi(x) \, dx \\
= {} &amp; i \hbar \cdot \int_{-\infty}^\infty \psi^*(x) \left[ \left(-x \cdot \frac{d\psi(x)}{dx}\right) + \frac{d(x \psi(x))}{dx} \right] \, dx \\
= {} &amp; i \hbar \cdot \int_{-\infty}^\infty \psi^*(x) \left[ \left(-x \cdot \frac{d\psi(x)}{dx}\right) + \psi(x) + \left(x \cdot \frac{d\psi(x)}{dx}\right)\right] \, dx \\
= {} &amp; i \hbar \cdot \int_{-\infty}^\infty \psi^*(x) \psi(x) \, dx \\
= {} &amp; i \hbar \cdot \int_{-\infty}^\infty |\psi(x)|^2 \, dx \\
= {} &amp; i \hbar\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

Plugging this into the above inequalities, we get

:&lt;math&gt;\sigma_x^2 \sigma_p^2 \ge |\langle f \mid g \rangle|^2 \ge \left(\frac{\langle f\mid g\rangle-\langle g\mid f\rangle}{2i}\right)^2 = \left(\frac{i \hbar}{2 i}\right)^2 = \frac{\hbar^2}{4}&lt;/math&gt;
or taking the square root

:&lt;math&gt;\sigma_x \sigma_p \ge \frac{\hbar}{2}~.&lt;/math&gt;

Note that the only ''physics'' involved in this proof was that &lt;math&gt;\psi(x)&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\varphi(p)&lt;/math&gt; are wave functions for position and momentum, which are Fourier transforms of each other. A similar result would hold for ''any'' pair of conjugate variables.

===Matrix mechanics interpretation===
(Ref &lt;ref name="L&amp;L"/&gt;) 
{{Main article|Matrix mechanics}}
In matrix mechanics, observables such as position and momentum are represented by [[self-adjoint operator]]s. When considering pairs of observables,  an important quantity is the ''[[commutator]]''. For a pair of operators {{mvar|Â}} and {{mvar|B̂}},  one defines their commutator as
:&lt;math&gt;[\hat{A},\hat{B}]=\hat{A}\hat{B}-\hat{B}\hat{A}.&lt;/math&gt;
In the case of position and momentum, the commutator is the [[canonical commutation relation]]
:&lt;math&gt;[\hat{x},\hat{p}]=i \hbar.&lt;/math&gt;

The physical meaning of the non-commutativity can be understood by considering the effect of the commutator on position and momentum [[eigenstate]]s. Let &lt;math&gt;|\psi\rangle&lt;/math&gt; be a right eigenstate of position with a constant eigenvalue {{math|''x''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;}}. By definition, this means that &lt;math&gt;\hat{x}|\psi\rangle = x_0 |\psi\rangle.&lt;/math&gt; Applying the commutator to &lt;math&gt;|\psi\rangle&lt;/math&gt; yields
:&lt;math&gt;[\hat{x},\hat{p}] | \psi \rangle = (\hat{x}\hat{p}-\hat{p}\hat{x}) | \psi \rangle = (\hat{x} - x_0 \hat{I}) \hat{p} \, | \psi \rangle = i \hbar | \psi \rangle,&lt;/math&gt;
where {{mvar|Î}} is  the [[identity matrix|identity operator]].

Suppose, for the sake of [[proof by contradiction]], that &lt;math&gt;|\psi\rangle&lt;/math&gt; is also a right eigenstate of momentum, with constant eigenvalue {{mvar|''p''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;}}. If this were true, then  one could write
:&lt;math&gt;(\hat{x} - x_0 \hat{I}) \hat{p} \, | \psi \rangle = (\hat{x} - x_0 \hat{I}) p_0 \, | \psi \rangle = (x_0 \hat{I} - x_0 \hat{I})  p_0 \, | \psi \rangle=0.&lt;/math&gt;
On the other hand, the above canonical commutation relation requires that
:&lt;math&gt;[\hat{x},\hat{p}] | \psi \rangle=i \hbar | \psi \rangle \ne 0.&lt;/math&gt;
This implies that no quantum state can simultaneously be both a position and a momentum eigenstate.

When a state is measured, it is projected onto an eigenstate in the basis of the relevant observable. For example, if a particle's position is measured, then the state amounts to a position eigenstate. This means that the state is ''not'' a momentum eigenstate, however, but rather it can be represented  as a sum of multiple momentum basis eigenstates. In other words, the momentum must be less precise. This precision may be quantified by the [[standard deviation]]s,  
:&lt;math&gt;\sigma_x=\sqrt{\langle \hat{x}^2 \rangle-\langle \hat{x}\rangle^2}&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\sigma_p=\sqrt{\langle \hat{p}^2 \rangle-\langle \hat{p}\rangle^2}.&lt;/math&gt;

As in the wave mechanics interpretation above, one sees a tradeoff between the respective precisions of the two, quantified by the uncertainty principle.

==Robertson–Schrödinger uncertainty relations==
The most common general form of the uncertainty principle is the ''[[Howard Percy Robertson|Robertson]] uncertainty relation''.&lt;ref name="Robertson1929"&gt;{{Citation|last=Robertson|first=H. P.|title=The Uncertainty Principle|journal=Phys. Rev.|year=1929|volume=34|pages=163–64|bibcode = 1929PhRv...34..163R |doi = 10.1103/PhysRev.34.163 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

For an arbitrary [[Self-adjoint operator|Hermitian operator]] &lt;math&gt;\hat{\mathcal{O}}&lt;/math&gt; we can associate a standard deviation

:::&lt;math&gt;\sigma_{\mathcal{O}} = \sqrt{\langle \hat{\mathcal{O}}^2 \rangle-\langle \hat{\mathcal{O}}\rangle^2},&lt;/math&gt;

where the brackets &lt;math&gt;\langle\mathcal{O}\rangle&lt;/math&gt; indicate an [[expectation value (quantum mechanics)|expectation value]]. For a pair of operators &lt;math&gt;\hat{A}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\hat{B}&lt;/math&gt;, we may define their ''[[commutator]]'' as

:::&lt;math&gt;[\hat{A},\hat{B}]=\hat{A}\hat{B}-\hat{B}\hat{A},&lt;/math&gt;

In this notation, the Robertson uncertainty relation is given by

::: &lt;math&gt;\sigma_A \sigma_B \geq \left| \frac{1}{2i}\langle[\hat{A},\hat{B}]\rangle \right| = \frac{1}{2}\left|\langle[\hat{A},\hat{B}]\rangle \right|,&lt;/math&gt;

The Robertson uncertainty relation immediately [[Logical consequence|follows from]] a slightly stronger inequality, the ''Schrödinger uncertainty relation'',&lt;ref name="Schrodinger1930"&gt;{{Citation | last = Schrödinger |first = E. | title = Zum Heisenbergschen Unschärfeprinzip | journal = Sitzungsberichte der Preussischen Akademie der Wissenschaften, Physikalisch-mathematische Klasse | volume = 14 | pages = 296–303 | year = 1930}}&lt;/ref&gt;

!Proof of the Schrödinger uncertainty relation

|The derivation shown here incorporates and builds off of those shown in Robertson,&lt;ref name="Robertson1929" /&gt; Schrödinger&lt;ref name="Schrodinger1930" /&gt; and standard textbooks such as Griffiths.&lt;ref name="Griffiths2005"&gt;{{Citation|last=Griffiths|first=David|title=Quantum Mechanics|year=2005|publisher=Pearson|location=New Jersey}}&lt;/ref&gt; For any Hermitian operator &lt;math&gt;\hat{A}&lt;/math&gt;, based upon the definition of [[variance]], we have

:::&lt;math&gt; \sigma_A^2 = \langle(\hat{A}-\langle \hat{A} \rangle)\Psi|(\hat{A}-\langle \hat{A} \rangle)\Psi\rangle. &lt;/math&gt;

we let &lt;math&gt;|f\rangle=|(\hat{A}-\langle \hat{A} \rangle)\Psi\rangle &lt;/math&gt; and thus

:::&lt;math&gt; \sigma_A^2 = \langle f\mid f\rangle\, .&lt;/math&gt;

Similarly, for any other Hermitian operator &lt;math&gt; \hat{B} &lt;/math&gt; in the same state

:::&lt;math&gt; \sigma_B^2 = \langle(\hat{B}-\langle \hat{B} \rangle)\Psi|(\hat{B}-\langle \hat{B} \rangle)\Psi\rangle = \langle g\mid g\rangle &lt;/math&gt;

for &lt;math&gt; |g\rangle=|(\hat{B}-\langle \hat{B} \rangle)\Psi \rangle.&lt;/math&gt;

The product of the two deviations can thus be expressed as

:::{{NumBlk|:|&lt;math&gt; \sigma_A^2\sigma_B^2 = \langle f\mid f\rangle\langle g\mid g\rangle. &lt;/math&gt;|{{EquationRef|1}}}}

In order to relate the two vectors &lt;math&gt;|f\rangle&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;|g\rangle&lt;/math&gt;, we use the [[Cauchy–Schwarz inequality]]&lt;ref name="Riley2006"&gt;{{Citation | last = Riley | first = K. F. | author2 = M. P. Hobson and S. J. Bence | title = Mathematical Methods for Physics and Engineering | publisher = Cambridge | year = 2006 | pages = 246 }}&lt;/ref&gt; which is defined as

:::&lt;math&gt;\langle f\mid f\rangle\langle g\mid g\rangle \geq |\langle f\mid g\rangle|^2, &lt;/math&gt;

and thus Eq. ({{EquationNote|1}}) can be written as

:::{{NumBlk|:|&lt;math&gt;\sigma_A^2\sigma_B^2 \geq |\langle f\mid g\rangle|^2.&lt;/math&gt;|{{EquationRef|2}}}}

Since &lt;math&gt; \langle f\mid g\rangle&lt;/math&gt; is in general a complex number, we use the fact that the modulus squared of any complex number &lt;math&gt;z&lt;/math&gt; is defined as &lt;math&gt;|z|^2=zz^{*}&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;z^{*}&lt;/math&gt; is the complex conjugate of &lt;math&gt;z&lt;/math&gt;. The modulus squared can also be expressed as

:::{{NumBlk|:|&lt;math&gt; |z|^2 = \Big(\operatorname{Re}(z)\Big)^2+\Big(\operatorname{Im}(z)\Big)^2 = \Big(\frac{z+z^\ast}{2}\Big)^2 +\Big(\frac{z-z^\ast}{2i}\Big)^2. &lt;/math&gt;|{{EquationRef|3}}}}

we let &lt;math&gt;z=\langle f\mid g\rangle&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;z^{*}=\langle g \mid f \rangle &lt;/math&gt; and substitute these into the equation above to get

:::{{NumBlk|:|&lt;math&gt;|\langle f\mid g\rangle|^2 = \bigg(\frac{\langle f\mid g\rangle+\langle g\mid f\rangle}{2}\bigg)^2 + \bigg(\frac{\langle f\mid g\rangle-\langle g\mid f\rangle}{2i}\bigg)^2 &lt;/math&gt;|{{EquationRef|4}}}}

The inner product &lt;math&gt;\langle f\mid g\rangle &lt;/math&gt; is written out explicitly as

:::&lt;math&gt;\langle f\mid g\rangle = \langle(\hat{A}-\langle \hat{A} \rangle)\Psi|(\hat{B}-\langle \hat{B} \rangle)\Psi\rangle,&lt;/math&gt;

and using the fact that &lt;math&gt;\hat{A}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\hat{B}&lt;/math&gt; are Hermitian operators, we find

:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
\langle f\mid g\rangle &amp; = \langle\Psi|(\hat{A}-\langle \hat{A}\rangle)(\hat{B}-\langle \hat{B}\rangle)\Psi\rangle \\[4pt]
&amp; = \langle\Psi\mid(\hat{A}\hat{B}-\hat{A}\langle \hat{B}\rangle - \hat{B}\langle \hat{A}\rangle + \langle \hat{A}\rangle\langle \hat{B}\rangle)\Psi\rangle \\[4pt]
&amp; = \langle\Psi\mid\hat{A}\hat{B}\Psi\rangle-\langle\Psi\mid\hat{A}\langle \hat{B}\rangle\Psi\rangle
-\langle\Psi\mid\hat{B}\langle \hat{A}\rangle\Psi\rangle+\langle\Psi\mid\langle \hat{A}\rangle\langle \hat{B}\rangle\Psi\rangle \\[4pt]
&amp; =\langle \hat{A}\hat{B}\rangle-\langle \hat{A}\rangle\langle \hat{B}\rangle-\langle \hat{A}\rangle\langle \hat{B}\rangle+\langle \hat{A}\rangle\langle \hat{B}\rangle \\[4pt]
&amp; =\langle \hat{A}\hat{B}\rangle-\langle \hat{A}\rangle\langle \hat{B}\rangle.
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

Similarly it can be shown that &lt;math&gt;\langle g\mid f\rangle = \langle \hat{B}\hat{A}\rangle-\langle \hat{A}\rangle\langle \hat{B}\rangle.&lt;/math&gt;

Thus we have

:::&lt;math&gt;
\langle f\mid g\rangle-\langle g\mid f\rangle = \langle \hat{A}\hat{B}\rangle-\langle \hat{A}\rangle\langle \hat{B}\rangle-\langle \hat{B}\hat{A}\rangle+\langle \hat{A}\rangle\langle \hat{B}\rangle = \langle [\hat{A},\hat{B}]\rangle
&lt;/math&gt;

and

:::&lt;math&gt;\langle f\mid g\rangle+\langle g\mid f\rangle = \langle \hat{A}\hat{B}\rangle-\langle \hat{A}\rangle\langle \hat{B}\rangle+\langle \hat{B}\hat{A}\rangle-\langle \hat{A}\rangle\langle \hat{B}\rangle = \langle \{\hat{A},\hat{B}\}\rangle -2\langle \hat{A}\rangle\langle \hat{B}\rangle. &lt;/math&gt;

We now substitute the above two equations above back into Eq. ({{EquationNote|4}}) and get
:::&lt;math&gt;
|\langle f\mid g\rangle|^2=\Big(\frac{1}{2}\langle\{\hat{A},\hat{B}\}\rangle - \langle \hat{A} \rangle\langle \hat{B}\rangle\Big)^2 + \Big(\frac{1}{2i} \langle[\hat{A},\hat{B}]\rangle\Big)^{2}\, .
&lt;/math&gt;

Substituting the above into Eq. ({{EquationNote|2}}) we get the Schrödinger uncertainty relation

:::&lt;math&gt;
\sigma_A\sigma_B \geq \sqrt{\Big(\frac{1}{2}\langle\{\hat{A},\hat{B}\}\rangle - \langle \hat{A} \rangle\langle \hat{B}\rangle\Big)^2 + \Big(\frac{1}{2i} \langle[\hat{A},\hat{B}]\rangle\Big)^2}.
&lt;/math&gt;

This proof has an issue&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Davidson|first=E. R.|title=On Derivations of the Uncertainty Principle|journal=J. Chem.

It suffices to assume that they are merely [[Self-adjoint operator#Symmetric operators|symmetric operators]].

===Examples===

Since the Robertson and Schrödinger relations are for general operators, the relations can be applied to any two observables to obtain specific uncertainty relations. A few of the most common relations found in the literature are given below.
* For position and linear momentum, the [[canonical commutation relation]] &lt;math&gt;[\hat{x}, \hat{p}] = i\hbar&lt;/math&gt; implies the Kennard inequality from above:
:: &lt;math&gt;\sigma_x \sigma_p \geq \frac{\hbar}{2}.&lt;/math&gt;
* For two orthogonal components of the [[angular momentum|total angular momentum]] operator of an object:

: where ''i'', ''j'', ''k'' are distinct, and ''J''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; denotes angular momentum along the ''x''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; axis. This relation implies that unless all three components vanish together, only a single component of a system's angular momentum can be defined with arbitrary precision, normally the component parallel to an external (magnetic or electric) field. Moreover, for &lt;math&gt;[J_x, J_y] = i \hbar \varepsilon_{xyz} J_z&lt;/math&gt;, a choice &lt;math&gt;\hat{A} = J_x&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\hat{B} = J_y&lt;/math&gt;, in angular momentum multiplets, ''ψ'' = |''j'', ''m''〉, bounds the [[Casimir invariant]] (angular momentum squared, &lt;math&gt;\langle J_x^2+ J_y^2 + J_z^2 \rangle&lt;/math&gt;) from below and thus yields useful constraints such as {{nobr|''j''(''j'' + 1) ≥ ''m''(''m'' + 1)}}, and hence ''j'' ≥ ''m'', among others.
*{{anchor|Time–energy uncertainty relation}} In non-relativistic mechanics, time is privileged as an [[independent variable]]. Nevertheless, in 1945, [[Leonid Mandelshtam|L. I.

:: &lt;math&gt; \sigma_E \frac{\sigma_B}{\left| \frac{\mathrm{d}\langle \hat B \rangle}{\mathrm{d}t}\right |} \ge \frac{\hbar}{2},&lt;/math&gt;
: where σ&lt;sub&gt;''E''&lt;/sub&gt; is the standard deviation of the energy operator (Hamiltonian) in the state {{mvar|ψ}}, σ&lt;sub&gt;''B''&lt;/sub&gt; stands for the standard deviation of ''B''. Although the second factor in the left-hand side has dimension of time, it is different from the time parameter that enters the [[Schrödinger equation]]. It is a ''lifetime'' of the state {{mvar|ψ}} with respect to the observable ''B'': In other words, this is the ''time interval'' (Δ''t'') after which the expectation value &lt;math&gt;\langle\hat B\rangle&lt;/math&gt; changes appreciably.
: An informal, heuristic meaning of the principle is the following: A state that only exists for a short time cannot have a definite energy. To have a definite energy, the frequency of the state must be defined accurately, and this requires the state to hang around for many cycles, the reciprocal of the required accuracy. For example, in [[Electromagnetic spectroscopy|spectroscopy]], excited states have a finite lifetime. By the time–energy uncertainty principle, they do not have a definite energy, and, each time they decay, the energy they release is slightly different. The average energy of the outgoing photon has a peak at the theoretical energy of the state, but the distribution has a finite width called the [[Spectral linewidth|''natural linewidth'']]. Fast-decaying states have a broad linewidth, while slow-decaying states have a narrow linewidth.&lt;ref&gt;The broad linewidth of fast-decaying states makes it difficult to accurately measure the energy of the state, and researchers have even used detuned microwave cavities to slow down the decay rate, to get sharper peaks. {{Citation |last=Gabrielse |first=Gerald |author2=H.

: The same linewidth effect also makes it difficult to specify the [[rest mass]] of unstable, fast-decaying particles in [[particle physics]].

===Energy–time uncertainty principle{{anchors|Energy–time uncertainty principle}}===
Other than the position–momentum uncertainty relation, the most important uncertainty relation is that between energy and time. The energy–time uncertainty relation is not, however, an obvious consequence of the general Robertson–Schrödinger relation. Since energy bears the same relation to time as momentum does to space in [[special relativity]], it was clear to many early founders, [[Niels Bohr]] among them, that the following relation should hold:&lt;ref name="Heisenberg_1927"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Heisenberg_1930"/&gt;

::&lt;math&gt; \Delta E \Delta t \gtrsim h,&lt;/math&gt;

but it was not always obvious what &lt;math&gt;\Delta t&lt;/math&gt; precisely meant. The problem is that the time at which the particle has a given state is not an operator belonging to the particle, it is a parameter describing the evolution of the system. As [[Lev Landau]] once joked "To violate the time–energy uncertainty relation all I have to do is measure the energy very precisely and then look at my watch!"&lt;ref name="C Jansson"&gt;[https://arxiv.org/pdf/0802.3625 The GMc-interpretation of Quantum Mechanics], by Christian Jansson, February 25, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

One ''false'' formulation of the energy–time uncertainty principle says that measuring the energy of a quantum system to an accuracy &lt;math&gt;\Delta E&lt;/math&gt; requires a time interval &lt;math&gt;\Delta t &gt; h/\Delta E&lt;/math&gt;. This formulation is similar to the one alluded to in Landau's joke, and was explicitly invalidated by [[Yakir Aharonov|Y. Aharonov]] and [[David Bohm|D. Bohm]] in 1961.&lt;ref&gt;http://148.216.10.84/archivoshistoricosMQ/ModernaHist/Aharonov%20a.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; The time &lt;math&gt;\Delta t&lt;/math&gt; in the uncertainty relation is the time during which the system exists unperturbed, not the time during which the experimental equipment is turned on, whereas the position in the other version of the principle refers to where the particle has some probability to be and not where the observer might look.

Another common misconception is that the energy–time uncertainty principle says that the [[conservation of energy]] can be temporarily violated—energy can be "borrowed" from the universe as long as it is "returned" within a short amount of time.&lt;ref name="Griffiths2005"/&gt;   Although this agrees with the ''spirit'' of [[relativistic quantum mechanics]], it is based on the false axiom that the energy of the universe is an exactly known parameter at all times. More accurately, when events transpire at shorter time intervals, there is a greater uncertainty in the energy of these events. Therefore it is not that the conservation of energy is ''violated'' when [[quantum field theory]] uses temporary electron–positron pairs in its calculations, but that the energy of quantum systems is not known with enough precision to limit their behavior to a single, simple history. Thus the influence of ''all histories'' must be incorporated into quantum calculations, including those with much greater or much less energy than the mean of the measured/calculated energy distribution.

In 1932 Dirac offered a precise definition and derivation of the time–energy uncertainty relation in a relativistic quantum theory of "events".&lt;ref&gt;see here, and the linked references: http://www.springerlink.com/content/nwq557633112kxk2/&lt;/ref&gt;

===A counterexample===
Suppose we consider a quantum [[particle in a ring|particle on a ring]], where the wave function depends on an angular variable &lt;math&gt;\theta&lt;/math&gt;, which we may take to lie in the interval &lt;math&gt;[0,2\pi]&lt;/math&gt;. Define "position" and "momentum" operators &lt;math&gt;\hat{A}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\hat{B}&lt;/math&gt; by

: &lt;math&gt;\hat{A}\psi(\theta)=\theta\psi(\theta),\quad \theta\in [0,2\pi],&lt;/math&gt;

and

:&lt;math&gt;\hat{B}\psi=-i\hbar\frac{d\psi}{d\theta},&lt;/math&gt;

where we impose periodic boundary conditions on &lt;math&gt;\hat{B}&lt;/math&gt;. Note that the definition of &lt;math&gt;\hat{A}&lt;/math&gt; depends on our choice to have &lt;math&gt;\theta&lt;/math&gt; range from 0 to &lt;math&gt;2\pi&lt;/math&gt;. These operators satisfy the usual commutation relations for position and momentum operators, &lt;math&gt;[\hat{A},\hat{B}]=i\hbar&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;More precisely, &lt;math&gt;\hat{A}\hat{B}\psi-\hat{B}\hat{A}\psi=i\hbar\psi&lt;/math&gt; whenever both &lt;math&gt;\hat{A}\hat{B}\psi&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\hat{B}\hat{A}\psi&lt;/math&gt; are defined, and the space of such &lt;math&gt;\psi&lt;/math&gt; is a dense subspace of the quantum Hilbert space. See  {{Citation | last = Hall | first = B. C. | title = Quantum Theory for Mathematicians | publisher = Springer | year = 2013 | pages = 245 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Now let &lt;math&gt;\psi&lt;/math&gt; be any of the eigenstates of &lt;math&gt;\hat{B}&lt;/math&gt;, which are given by &lt;math&gt;\psi(\theta)=e^{2\pi in\theta}&lt;/math&gt;. Note that these states are normalizable, unlike the eigenstates of the momentum operator on the line. Note also that the operator &lt;math&gt;\hat{A}&lt;/math&gt; is bounded, since &lt;math&gt;\theta&lt;/math&gt; ranges over a bounded interval. Thus, in the state &lt;math&gt;\psi&lt;/math&gt;, the uncertainty of &lt;math&gt;B&lt;/math&gt; is zero and the uncertainty of &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; is finite, so that 
:&lt;math&gt;\sigma_A\sigma_B=0.&lt;/math&gt;
Although this result appears to violate the Robertson uncertainty principle, the paradox is resolved when we note that &lt;math&gt;\psi&lt;/math&gt; is not in the domain of the operator &lt;math&gt;\hat{B}\hat{A}&lt;/math&gt;, since multiplication by &lt;math&gt;\theta&lt;/math&gt; disrupts the periodic boundary conditions imposed on &lt;math&gt;\hat{B}&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref name="Hall2013"/&gt; Thus, the derivation of the Robertson relation, which requires &lt;math&gt;\hat{A}\hat{B}\psi&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\hat{B}\hat{A}\psi&lt;/math&gt; to be defined, does not apply. (These also furnish an example of operators satisfying the canonical commutation relations but not the [[Canonical commutation relation#The Weyl relations|Weyl relations]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last = Hall | first = B. C. | title = Quantum Theory for Mathematicians | publisher = Springer | year = 2013 | pages = 285 }}&lt;/ref&gt;)

For the usual position and momentum operators &lt;math&gt;\hat{X}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\hat{P}&lt;/math&gt; on the real line, no such counterexamples can occur. As long as &lt;math&gt;\sigma_x&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\sigma_p&lt;/math&gt; are defined in the state &lt;math&gt;\psi&lt;/math&gt;, the Heisenberg uncertainty principle holds, even if &lt;math&gt;\psi&lt;/math&gt; fails to be in the domain of &lt;math&gt;\hat{X}\hat{P}&lt;/math&gt; or of &lt;math&gt;\hat{P}\hat{X}&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last = Hall | first = B.

===Quantum harmonic oscillator stationary states===
{{Main article|Quantum harmonic oscillator|Stationary state}}
Consider a one-dimensional quantum harmonic oscillator (QHO). It is possible to express the position and momentum operators in terms of the [[creation and annihilation operators]]:
:&lt;math&gt;\hat x = \sqrt{\frac{\hbar}{2m\omega}}(a+a^\dagger)&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\hat p = i\sqrt{\frac{m \omega\hbar}{2}}(a^\dagger-a).&lt;/math&gt;

Using the standard rules for creation and annihilation operators on the eigenstates of the QHO,
:&lt;math&gt;a^{\dagger}|n\rangle=\sqrt{n+1}|n+1\rangle&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;a|n\rangle=\sqrt{n}|n-1\rangle, &lt;/math&gt; 
the [[variance]]s may be computed directly,
:&lt;math&gt;\sigma_x^2 = \frac{\hbar}{m\omega} \left( n+\frac{1}{2}\right)&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\sigma_p^2 = \hbar m\omega \left( n+\frac{1}{2}\right)\, .&lt;/math&gt;
The product of these standard deviations is then
:&lt;math&gt;\sigma_x \sigma_p = \hbar \left(n+\frac{1}{2}\right) \ge \frac{\hbar}{2}.~&lt;/math&gt;

In particular, the above Kennard bound&lt;ref name="Kennard" /&gt; is saturated for the [[ground state]] {{math|''n''{{=}}0}}, for which the probability density is just the [[normal distribution]].

===Quantum harmonic oscillator with Gaussian initial condition===

In a quantum harmonic oscillator of characteristic angular frequency ω, place a state that is offset from the bottom of the potential by some displacement ''x''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; as
:&lt;math&gt;\psi(x)=\left(\frac{m \Omega}{\pi \hbar}\right)^{1/4} \exp{\left( -\frac{m \Omega (x-x_0)^2}{2\hbar}\right)},&lt;/math&gt;
where Ω describes the width of the initial state but need not be the same as ω. Through integration over the [[Propagator#Basic Examples: Propagator of Free Particle and Harmonic Oscillator|propagator]], we can solve for the {{Not a typo|full time}}-dependent solution. After many cancelations, the probability densities reduce to
:&lt;math&gt;|\Psi(x,t)|^2 \sim \mathcal{N}\left( x_0 \cos{(\omega t)} , \frac{\hbar}{2 m \Omega} \left( \cos^2(\omega t) + \frac{\Omega^2}{\omega^2} \sin^2{(\omega t)} \right)\right)&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;|\Phi(p,t)|^2 \sim \mathcal{N}\left( -m x_0 \omega \sin(\omega t), \frac{\hbar m \Omega}{2} \left( \cos^2{(\omega t)} + \frac{\omega^2}{\Omega^2} \sin^2{(\omega t)} \right)\right),&lt;/math&gt;
where we have used the notation &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{N}(\mu, \sigma^2)&lt;/math&gt; to denote a normal distribution of mean μ and variance σ&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;. Copying the variances above and applying [[list of trigonometric identities|trigonometric identities]], we can write the product of the standard deviations as

: &lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
\sigma_x \sigma_p&amp;=\frac{\hbar}{2}\sqrt{\left( \cos^2{(\omega t)} + \frac{\Omega^2}{\omega^2} \sin^2{(\omega t)} \right)\left( \cos^2{(\omega t)} + \frac{\omega^2}{\Omega^2} \sin^2{(\omega t)} \right)} \\
&amp;= \frac{\hbar}{4}\sqrt{3+\frac{1}{2}\left(\frac{\Omega^2}{\omega^2}+\frac{\omega^2}{\Omega^2}\right)-\left(\frac{1}{2}\left(\frac{\Omega^2}{\omega^2}+\frac{\omega^2}{\Omega^2}\right)-1\right) \cos{(4 \omega t)}}
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

From the relations

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{\Omega^2}{\omega^2}+\frac{\omega^2}{\Omega^2} \ge 2, \quad |\cos(4 \omega t)| \le 1,&lt;/math&gt;

we can conclude the following: (the right most equality holds only when Ω&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''ω'') .
:&lt;math&gt;\sigma_x \sigma_p \ge \frac{\hbar}{4}\sqrt{3+\frac{1}{2} \left(\frac{\Omega^2}{\omega^2}+\frac{\omega^2}{\Omega^2}\right)-\left(\frac{1}{2} \left(\frac{\Omega^2}{\omega^2}+\frac{\omega^2}{\Omega^2}\right)-1\right)} = \frac{\hbar}{2}. &lt;/math&gt;

===Coherent states===
{{Main article|Coherent state}}
A coherent state is a right eigenstate of the [[annihilation operator]],
:&lt;math&gt;\hat{a}|\alpha\rangle=\alpha|\alpha\rangle&lt;/math&gt;,
which may be represented in terms of [[Fock state]]s as
:&lt;math&gt;|\alpha\rangle =e^{-{|\alpha|^2\over2}} \sum_{n=0}^\infty {\alpha^n \over \sqrt{n!}}|n\rangle&lt;/math&gt;

In the picture where the coherent state is a massive particle in a QHO, the position and momentum operators may be expressed in terms of the annihilation operators in the same formulas above and used to calculate the variances,
:&lt;math&gt;\sigma_x^2 = \frac{\hbar}{2 m \omega},&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\sigma_p^2 = \frac{\hbar m \omega}{2}.&lt;/math&gt;
Therefore, every coherent state saturates the Kennard bound

:&lt;math&gt;\sigma_x \sigma_p = \sqrt{\frac{\hbar}{2 m \omega}} \, \sqrt{\frac{\hbar m \omega}{2}} = \frac{\hbar}{2}.&lt;/math&gt;

with position and momentum each contributing an amount &lt;math&gt;\sqrt{\hbar/2}&lt;/math&gt; in a "balanced" way. Moreover, every [[squeezed coherent state]] also saturates the Kennard bound although the individual contributions of position and momentum need not be balanced in general.

===Particle in a box===
{{Main article|Particle in a box}}
Consider a particle in a one-dimensional box of length &lt;math&gt;L&lt;/math&gt;. The [[Particle in a box#Wavefunctions|eigenfunctions in position and momentum space]] are
:&lt;math&gt;\psi_n(x,t) =
\begin{cases}
A \sin(k_n x)\mathrm{e}^{-\mathrm{i}\omega_n t}, &amp; 0 &lt; x &lt; L,\\
0, &amp; \text{otherwise,}
\end{cases}
&lt;/math&gt;
and
:&lt;math&gt;\varphi_n(p,t)=\sqrt{\frac{\pi L}{\hbar}}\,\,\frac{n\left(1-(-1)^ne^{-ikL} \right) e^{-i \omega_n t}}{\pi ^2 n^2-k^2 L^2},&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;\omega_n=\frac{\pi^2 \hbar n^2}{8 L^2 m}&lt;/math&gt; and we have used the [[de Broglie relation]] &lt;math&gt;p=\hbar k&lt;/math&gt;. The variances of &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt; can be calculated explicitly:
:&lt;math&gt;\sigma_x^2=\frac{L^2}{12}\left(1-\frac{6}{n^2\pi^2}\right)&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\sigma_p^2=\left(\frac{\hbar n\pi}{L}\right)^2. &lt;/math&gt;

The product of the standard deviations is therefore
:&lt;math&gt;\sigma_x \sigma_p = \frac{\hbar}{2} \sqrt{\frac{n^2\pi^2}{3}-2}.&lt;/math&gt;
For all &lt;math&gt;n=1, \, 2, \, 3,\, \ldots&lt;/math&gt;, the quantity &lt;math&gt;\sqrt{\frac{n^2\pi^2}{3}-2}&lt;/math&gt; is greater than 1, so the uncertainty principle is never violated. For numerical concreteness, the smallest value occurs when &lt;math&gt;n=1&lt;/math&gt;, in which case

:&lt;math&gt;\sigma_x \sigma_p = \frac{\hbar}{2} \sqrt{\frac{\pi^2}{3}-2} \approx 0.568 \hbar &gt; \frac{\hbar}{2}.&lt;/math&gt;

===Constant momentum===
{{Main article|Wave packet}}
[[File:Guassian Dispersion.gif|360 px|thumb|right|Position space probability density of an initially Gaussian state moving at minimally uncertain, constant momentum in free space]]
Assume a particle initially has a [[momentum space]] wave function described by a normal distribution around some constant momentum ''p''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; according to

:&lt;math&gt;\varphi(p) = \left(\frac{x_0}{\hbar \sqrt{\pi}} \right)^{1/2} \cdot \exp{\left(\frac{-x_0^2 (p-p_0)^2}{2\hbar^2}\right)},&lt;/math&gt;

where we have introduced a reference scale &lt;math&gt;x_0=\sqrt{\hbar/m\omega_0}&lt;/math&gt;, with &lt;math&gt;\omega_0&gt;0&lt;/math&gt; describing the width of the distribution−−cf. [[nondimensionalization]]. If the state is allowed to evolve in free space, then the time-dependent momentum and position space wave functions are

:&lt;math&gt;\Phi(p,t) = \left(\frac{x_0}{\hbar \sqrt{\pi}} \right)^{1/2} \cdot \exp{\left(\frac{-x_0^2 (p-p_0)^2}{2\hbar^2}-\frac{ip^2 t}{2m\hbar}\right)},&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\Psi(x,t) = \left(\frac{1}{x_0 \sqrt{\pi}} \right)^{1/2} \cdot \frac{e^{-x_0^2 p_0^2 /2\hbar^2}}{\sqrt{1+i\omega_0 t}} \cdot \exp{\left(-\frac{(x-ix_0^2 p_0/\hbar)^2}{2x_0^2 (1+i\omega_0 t)}\right)}.&lt;/math&gt;

Since &lt;math&gt; \langle p(t) \rangle = p_0&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\sigma_p(t) = \hbar / x_0 \sqrt{2},&lt;/math&gt; this can be interpreted as a particle moving along with constant momentum at arbitrarily high precision. On the other hand, the standard deviation of the position is
:&lt;math&gt;\sigma_x = \frac{x_0}{\sqrt{2}} \sqrt{1+\omega_0^2 t^2}&lt;/math&gt;
such that the uncertainty product can only increase with time as
:&lt;math&gt;\sigma_x(t) \sigma_p(t) = \frac{\hbar}{2} \sqrt{1+\omega_0^2 t^2}&lt;/math&gt;

==Additional uncertainty relations==

===Mixed states===
The Robertson–Schrödinger uncertainty relation may be generalized in a straightforward way to describe [[density matrix|mixed states]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Steiger|first=Nathan|title=Quantum Uncertainty and Conservation Law Restrictions on Gate Fidelity|url=http://www.physics.byu.edu/Thesis/view.aspx?id=270|publisher=Brigham Young University|accessdate=19 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:::&lt;math&gt;\sigma_A^2 \sigma_B^2 \geq \left(\frac{1}{2}\operatorname{tr}(\rho\{A,B\}) - \operatorname{tr}(\rho A)\operatorname{tr}(\rho B)\right)^2 +\left(\frac{1}{2i} \operatorname{tr}(\rho[A,B])\right)^2&lt;/math&gt;

===The Maccone–Pati uncertainty relations===
The Robertson–Schrödinger uncertainty relation can be trivial if the state of the system is chosen to be eigenstate of one of the observable. The stronger uncertainty relations proved by Maccone and Pati give non-trivial bounds on the sum of the variances for two incompatible observables.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Maccone|first1=Lorenzo|last2=Pati|first2=Arun K.|title=Stronger Uncertainty Relations for All Incompatible Observables|journal=Physical Review Letters|date=31 December 2014|volume=113|issue=26|page=260401|doi=10.1103/PhysRevLett.113.260401|arxiv=1407.0338|bibcode=2014PhRvL.113z0401M}}&lt;/ref&gt;  For two non-commuting observables &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;B&lt;/math&gt; the first stronger uncertainty relation is given by 
:&lt;math&gt; \sigma_{A}^2 + \sigma_{ B}^2 \ge \pm i \langle \Psi\mid [A, B]|\Psi \rangle  + \mid \langle \Psi\mid(A \pm i B)\mid{\bar \Psi} \rangle|^2, &lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt; \sigma_{A}^2 = \langle \Psi |A^2 |\Psi \rangle - \langle \Psi \mid A \mid \Psi \rangle^2   &lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt; \sigma_{B}^2 = \langle \Psi |B^2 |\Psi \rangle - \langle \Psi \mid B \mid\Psi \rangle^2 &lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;|{\bar \Psi} \rangle &lt;/math&gt; is a normalized vector that is orthogonal to the state of the system &lt;math&gt;|\Psi \rangle &lt;/math&gt; and  one should choose the sign of  &lt;math&gt;\pm i \langle \Psi\mid[A, B]\mid\Psi \rangle &lt;/math&gt; to make this real quantity a positive number.

The second stronger uncertainty  relation is given by
:&lt;math&gt; \sigma_A^2 + \sigma_B^2 \ge \frac{1}{2}| \langle {\bar \Psi}_{A+B} \mid(A + B)\mid \Psi \rangle|^2 &lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;| {\bar \Psi}_{A+B} \rangle &lt;/math&gt;  is a state orthogonal to &lt;math&gt; |\Psi \rangle &lt;/math&gt;.
The form of &lt;math&gt;| {\bar \Psi}_{A+B} \rangle  &lt;/math&gt; implies that the right-hand side of the new uncertainty relation 
is nonzero unless &lt;math&gt;| \Psi\rangle  &lt;/math&gt; is an eigenstate of &lt;math&gt;(A + B)&lt;/math&gt;.  One may note that &lt;math&gt;|\Psi \rangle &lt;/math&gt; can be an eigenstate of &lt;math&gt;( A+ B)&lt;/math&gt; without being an eigenstate of either
&lt;math&gt; A&lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt; B &lt;/math&gt;. However,  when &lt;math&gt; |\Psi \rangle &lt;/math&gt;  is an eigenstate of one of the two observables the Heisenberg–Schrödinger uncertainty relation becomes trivial. But the lower bound in the new relation is nonzero 
unless &lt;math&gt; |\Psi \rangle &lt;/math&gt;  is an eigenstate of both.

===Phase space===
In the [[phase space formulation]] of quantum mechanics, the Robertson–Schrödinger relation follows from a positivity condition on a real star-square function. Given a [[Wigner quasi-probability distribution|Wigner function]] &lt;math&gt;W(x,p)&lt;/math&gt; with [[Moyal product|star product]] ★ and a function ''f'', the following is generally true:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Curtright | first1 = T. |last2= Zachos | first2= C. | title = Negative Probability and Uncertainty Relations| journal = Modern Physics Letters A  | volume = 16 | issue = 37 | pages = 2381–2385 | doi = 10.1142/S021773230100576X | year = 2001 | pmid =  | pmc = |arxiv = hep-th/0105226 |bibcode = 2001MPLA...16.2381C }}&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\langle f^* \star f \rangle =\int (f^* \star f) \, W(x,p) \, dx \, dp \ge 0.&lt;/math&gt;

Choosing &lt;math&gt;f=a+bx+cp&lt;/math&gt;, we arrive at

:&lt;math&gt;\langle f^* \star f \rangle =\begin{bmatrix}a^* &amp; b^* &amp; c^* \end{bmatrix}\begin{bmatrix}1 &amp; \langle x \rangle &amp; \langle p \rangle \\ \langle x \rangle &amp; \langle x \star x \rangle &amp; \langle x \star p \rangle \\ \langle p \rangle &amp; \langle p \star x \rangle &amp; \langle p \star p \rangle \end{bmatrix}\begin{bmatrix}a \\ b \\ c\end{bmatrix} \ge 0.&lt;/math&gt;

Since this positivity condition is true for ''all'' ''a'', ''b'', and ''c'', it follows that all the eigenvalues of the matrix are positive. The positive eigenvalues then imply a corresponding positivity condition on the [[determinant]]:

:&lt;math&gt;\det\begin{bmatrix}1 &amp; \langle x \rangle &amp; \langle p \rangle \\ \langle x \rangle &amp; \langle x \star x \rangle &amp; \langle x \star p \rangle \\ \langle p \rangle &amp; \langle p \star x \rangle &amp; \langle p \star p \rangle \end{bmatrix} = \det\begin{bmatrix}1 &amp; \langle x \rangle &amp; \langle p \rangle \\ \langle x \rangle &amp; \langle x^2 \rangle &amp; \left\langle xp + \frac{i\hbar}{2} \right\rangle \\ \langle p \rangle &amp; \left\langle xp - \frac{i\hbar}{2} \right\rangle &amp; \langle p^2 \rangle \end{bmatrix} \ge 0,&lt;/math&gt;

or, explicitly, after algebraic manipulation,

:&lt;math&gt;\sigma_x^2 \sigma_p^2 = \left( \langle x^2 \rangle - \langle x \rangle^2 \right)\left( \langle p^2 \rangle - \langle p \rangle^2 \right)\ge \left( \langle xp \rangle - \langle x \rangle \langle p \rangle \right)^2 + \frac{\hbar^2}{4} ~.&lt;/math&gt;

===Systematic and statistical errors===

The inequalities above focus on the ''statistical imprecision'' of observables as quantified by the standard deviation &lt;math&gt;\sigma&lt;/math&gt;. Heisenberg's original version, however, was dealing with the ''systematic error'', a disturbance of the quantum system produced by the measuring apparatus, i.e., an [[Observer effect (physics)|observer effect]].

If we let &lt;math&gt;\varepsilon_A&lt;/math&gt; represent the error (i.e., [[accuracy|inaccuracy]]) of a measurement of an observable ''A'' and &lt;math&gt;\eta_B&lt;/math&gt; the disturbance produced on a subsequent measurement of the conjugate variable ''B'' by the former measurement of ''A'', then the inequality proposed by Ozawa&lt;ref name="Ozawa2003"/&gt; — encompassing both systematic and statistical errors — holds:
{{Equation box 1
|indent =::
|equation = &lt;math&gt; \varepsilon_A\, \eta_B + \varepsilon_A \, \sigma_B + \sigma_A \, \eta_B \,\ge\,  \frac{1}{2} \, \left| \langle [\hat{A},\hat{B}] \rangle \right|&lt;/math&gt;

Heisenberg's uncertainty principle, as originally described in the 1927 formulation, mentions only the first term of Ozawa inequality, regarding the ''systematic error''.   Using the notation above to describe the ''error/disturbance'' effect of ''sequential measurements'' (first ''A'', then ''B''), it could be written as
{{Equation box 1
|indent =::
|equation = &lt;math&gt; \varepsilon_{A} \, \eta_{B} \, \ge \,   \frac{1}{2} \, \left| \langle [\hat{A},\hat{B}] \rangle \right|&lt;/math&gt;

The formal derivation of the Heisenberg relation is possible but far from intuitive.

Using the same formalism,&lt;ref name="Sen2014"/&gt; it is also possible to introduce the other kind of physical situation, often confused with the previous one, namely the case of ''simultaneous measurements'' (''A'' and ''B'' at the same time):

It is also possible to derive an uncertainty relation that, as the Ozawa's one, combines both the statistical and systematic error components, but keeps a form very close to the Heisenberg original inequality.  By adding Robertson&lt;ref name="Sen2014"/&gt; 
{{Equation box 1

=== Quantum entropic uncertainty principle ===

For many distributions, the standard deviation is not a particularly natural way of quantifying the structure. For example, uncertainty relations in which one of the observables is an angle has little physical meaning for fluctuations larger than one period.&lt;ref name="CarruthersNieto" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |first=D. |last=Judge |title=On the uncertainty relation for angle variables|journal=Il Nuovo Cimento|year=1964|volume=31|issue=2|pages=332–340|doi=10.1007/BF02733639|bibcode=1964NCim...31..332J}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |first1= M. |last1= Bouten |first2= N. |last2= Maene

A solution that overcomes these issues is an uncertainty based on [[entropic uncertainty]] instead of the product of variances. While formulating the [[many-worlds interpretation]] of quantum mechanics in 1957, [[Hugh Everett III]] conjectured a stronger extension of the uncertainty principle based on entropic certainty.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last=DeWitt |first=B.

the Shannon [[Information entropy|information entropies]]

:&lt;math&gt;H_a = \int_{-\infty}^\infty f(a) \log(f(a))\,da,&lt;/math&gt;

and 

:&lt;math&gt;H_b = \int_{-\infty}^\infty g(b) \log(g(b))\,db&lt;/math&gt;

are subject to the following constraint,

where the logarithms may be in any base.

The probability distribution functions associated with the position wave function {{math|''&amp;psi;(x)''}} and the momentum wave function {{math|''&amp;phi;(x)''}} have dimensions of inverse length and momentum respectively, but the entropies may be rendered dimensionless by

:&lt;math&gt;H_x = - \int |\psi(x)|^2 \ln (x_0\,|\psi(x)|^2 ) \,dx =-\left\langle \ln (x_0\mid\psi(x)|^2 ) \right\rangle&lt;/math&gt;

where {{math|''x''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;}} and {{math|''p''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;}} are some arbitrarily chosen length and momentum respectively, which render the arguments of the logarithms dimensionless. Note that the entropies will be functions of these chosen parameters. Due to the [[Wavefunction#Relation between wave functions|Fourier transform relation]] between the position wave function {{math|''&amp;psi;(x)''}} and the momentum wavefunction {{math|''&amp;phi;''(''p'')}}, the above constraint can be written for the corresponding entropies as
{{Equation box 1
|indent =:
|equation = &lt;math&gt;H_x + H_p \ge \log \left(\frac{e\,h}{2\,x_0\,p_0}\right)&lt;/math&gt;
|cellpadding= 6
|border
|border colour = #0073CF
|background colour=#F5FFFA}}
where {{mvar|h}} is [[Planck's constant]].

Depending on one's choice of the {{math|''x&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; p&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;''}} product, the expression may be written in many ways. If {{math|''x&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; p&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;''}} is chosen to be {{mvar|h}}, then
:&lt;math&gt;H_x + H_p \ge \log \left(\frac{e}{2}\right)&lt;/math&gt;

If, instead,  {{math|''x''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; ''p''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;}} is chosen to be {{mvar|ħ}}, then
:&lt;math&gt;H_x + H_p \ge \log (e\,\pi)&lt;/math&gt;

If {{math|''x&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;''}} and {{math|''p&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;''}} are chosen to be unity in whatever system of units are being used, then
:&lt;math&gt;H_x + H_p \ge \log \left(\frac{e\,h }{2}\right)&lt;/math&gt;
where {{mvar|h}} is interpreted as a dimensionless number equal to the value of Planck's constant in the chosen system of units.

The quantum entropic uncertainty principle is more restrictive than the Heisenberg uncertainty principle. From the inverse logarithmic Sobolev inequalities&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |first=D. |last=Chafaï |title=Gaussian maximum of entropy and reversed log-Sobolev inequality|arxiv=math/0102227 |doi=10.1007/978-3-540-36107-7_5 |year=2003 |isbn=978-3-540-00072-3 |pages=194–200}}&lt;/ref&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;H_x \le \frac{1}{2} \log ( 2e\pi \sigma_x^2 / x_0^2 )~,&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;H_p \le \frac{1}{2} \log ( 2e\pi \sigma_p^2 /p_0^2 )~,&lt;/math&gt;
(equivalently, from the fact that normal distributions maximize the entropy of all such with a given variance), it readily follows that this entropic uncertainty principle is ''stronger than the one based on standard deviations'', because

:&lt;math&gt;\sigma_x \sigma_p \ge \frac{\hbar}{2} \exp\left(H_x + H_p - \log \left(\frac{e\,h}{2\,x_0\,p_0}\right)\right) \ge \frac{\hbar}{2}~.&lt;/math&gt;

In other words, the Heisenberg uncertainty principle, is a consequence of the quantum entropic uncertainty principle, but not vice versa.  A few remarks on these inequalities. First, the choice of [[base e]] is a matter of popular convention in physics. The logarithm can alternatively be in any base, provided that it be consistent on both sides of the inequality.  Second, recall the [[Shannon entropy]] has been used, ''not'' the quantum [[von Neumann entropy]].  Finally, the normal distribution saturates the inequality, and it is the only distribution with this property, because it is the [[maximum entropy probability distribution]] among those with fixed variance (cf. [[differential entropy#Maximization in the normal distribution|here]] for proof).

!Entropic uncertainty of the normal distribution
|-
|We demonstrate this method on the ground state of the QHO, which as discussed above saturates the usual uncertainty based on standard deviations. The length scale can be set to whatever is convenient, so we assign

:&lt;math&gt;x_0=\sqrt{\frac{\hbar}{2m\omega}}&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}\psi(x) &amp;= \left(\frac{m \omega}{\pi \hbar}\right)^{1/4} \exp{\left( -\frac{m \omega x^2}{2\hbar}\right)} \\
&amp;= \left(\frac{1}{2\pi x_0^2}\right)^{1/4} \exp{\left( -\frac{x^2}{4x_0^2}\right)} \end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

The probability distribution is the normal distribution
:&lt;math&gt;|\psi(x)|^2 = \frac{1}{x_0 \sqrt{2\pi}} \exp{\left( -\frac{x^2}{2x_0^2}\right)}&lt;/math&gt;

with Shannon entropy
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}H_x &amp;= - \int |\psi(x)|^2 \ln (|\psi(x)|^2 \cdot x_0 ) \,dx \\
&amp;= -\frac{1}{x_0 \sqrt{2\pi}} \int_{-\infty}^\infty \exp{\left( -\frac{x^2}{2x_0^2}\right)} \ln \left[\frac{1}{\sqrt{2\pi}} \exp{\left( -\frac{x^2}{2x_0^2}\right)}\right] \, dx \\
&amp;= \frac{1}{\sqrt{2\pi}} \int_{-\infty}^\infty \exp{\left( -\frac{u^2}{2}\right)} \left[\ln(\sqrt{2\pi}) + \frac{u^2}{2}\right] \, du\\
&amp;= \ln(\sqrt{2\pi}) + \frac{1}{2}.\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

A completely analogous calculation proceeds for the momentum distribution. Choosing a standard momentum of &lt;math&gt;p_0=\hbar/x_0&lt;/math&gt;:
:&lt;math&gt;\varphi(p) = \left(\frac{2 x_0^2}{\pi \hbar^2}\right)^{1/4} \exp{\left( -\frac{x_0^2 p^2}{\hbar^2}\right)}&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;|\varphi(p)|^2 = \sqrt{\frac{2 x_0^2}{\pi \hbar^2}} \exp{\left( -\frac{2x_0^2 p^2}{\hbar^2}\right)}&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}H_p &amp;= - \int |\varphi(p)|^2 \ln (|\varphi(p)|^2 \cdot \hbar / x_0 ) \,dp \\
&amp;= -\sqrt{\frac{2 x_0^2}{\pi \hbar^2}} \int_{-\infty}^\infty \exp{\left( -\frac{2x_0^2 p^2}{\hbar^2}\right)} \ln \left[\sqrt{\frac{2}{\pi}} \exp{\left( -\frac{2x_0^2 p^2}{\hbar^2}\right)}\right] \, dp \\
&amp;= \sqrt{\frac{2}{\pi}} \int_{-\infty}^\infty \exp{\left( -2v^2\right)} \left[\ln\left(\sqrt{\frac{\pi}{2}}\right) + 2v^2 \right] \, dv \\
&amp;= \ln\left(\sqrt{\frac{\pi}{2}}\right) + \frac{1}{2}.\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

The entropic uncertainty is therefore the limiting value

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}H_x+H_p &amp;= \ln(\sqrt{2\pi}) + \frac{1}{2} + \ln\left(\sqrt{\frac{\pi}{2}}\right) + \frac{1}{2}\\
&amp;= 1 + \ln \pi = \ln(e\pi).\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

A measurement apparatus will have a finite resolution set by the discretization of its possible outputs into bins, with the probability of lying within one of the bins given by the Born rule. We will consider the most common experimental situation, in which the bins are of uniform size. Let ''δx'' be a measure of the spatial resolution. We take the zeroth bin to be centered near the origin, with possibly some small constant offset ''c''. The probability of lying within the jth interval of width ''δx'' is

:&lt;math&gt;\operatorname P[x_j]= \int_{(j-1/2)\delta x-c}^{(j+1/2)\delta x-c}| \psi(x)|^2 \, dx&lt;/math&gt;

To account for this discretization, we can define the Shannon entropy of the wave function for a given measurement apparatus as

: &lt;math&gt;H_x=-\sum_{j=-\infty}^\infty \operatorname P[x_j] \ln \operatorname P[x_j].&lt;/math&gt;

Under the above definition, the entropic uncertainty relation is

:&lt;math&gt;H_x+H_p&gt;\ln\left(\frac{e}{2}\right)-\ln\left(\frac{\delta x \delta p}{h} \right).&lt;/math&gt;

Here we note that {{math|''δx''&amp;nbsp;''δp''/''h''}} is a typical infinitesimal phase space volume used in the calculation of a [[partition function (statistical mechanics)|partition function]]. The inequality is also strict and not saturated. Efforts to improve this bound are an active area of research.

:&lt;math&gt;\psi(x)=\left(\frac{m \omega}{\pi \hbar}\right)^{1/4} \exp{\left( -\frac{m \omega x^2}{2\hbar}\right)}&lt;/math&gt;

The probability of lying within one of these bins can be expressed in terms of the [[error function]].

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}\operatorname P[x_j] &amp;= \sqrt{\frac{m \omega}{\pi \hbar}} \int_{(j-1/2)\delta x}^{(j+1/2)\delta x} \exp\left( -\frac{m \omega x^2}{\hbar}\right) \, dx \\
&amp;= \sqrt{\frac{1}{\pi}} \int_{(j-1/2)\delta x\sqrt{m \omega / \hbar}}^{(j+1/2)\delta x\sqrt{m \omega / \hbar}} e^{u^2} \, du \\
&amp;= \frac{1}{2} \left[ \operatorname{erf} \left( \left(j+\frac{1}{2}\right)\delta x \cdot \sqrt{\frac{m \omega}{\hbar}}\right)- \operatorname {erf} \left( \left(j-\frac{1}{2}\right)\delta x \cdot \sqrt{\frac{m \omega}{\hbar}}\right) \right]\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

The momentum probabilities are completely analogous.

:&lt;math&gt;\operatorname P[p_j] = \frac{1}{2} \left[ \operatorname{erf} \left( \left(j+\frac{1}{2}\right)\delta p \cdot \frac{1}{\sqrt{\hbar m \omega}}\right)- \operatorname{erf} \left( \left(j-\frac{1}{2}\right)\delta x \cdot \frac{1}{\sqrt{\hbar m \omega}}\right) \right]&lt;/math&gt;

For simplicity, we will set the resolutions to

:&lt;math&gt;\delta x = \sqrt{\frac{h}{m \omega}}&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\delta p = \sqrt{h m \omega}&lt;/math&gt;

so that the probabilities reduce to

:&lt;math&gt;\operatorname P[x_j] = \operatorname P[p_j] = \frac{1}{2} \left[ \operatorname {erf} \left( \left(j+\frac{1}{2}\right) \sqrt{2\pi} \right)- \operatorname {erf} \left( \left(j-\frac{1}{2}\right) \sqrt{2\pi} \right) \right]&lt;/math&gt;

The Shannon entropy can be evaluated numerically.
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}H_x = H_p &amp;= -\sum_{j=-\infty}^\infty \operatorname P[x_j] \ln \operatorname P[x_j] \\
&amp;= -\sum_{j=-\infty}^\infty \frac{1}{2} \left[ \operatorname {erf} \left( \left(j+\frac{1}{2}\right) \sqrt{2\pi} \right)- \operatorname {erf} \left( \left(j-\frac{1}{2}\right) \sqrt{2\pi} \right) \right] \ln \frac{1}{2} \left[ \operatorname {erf} \left( \left(j+\frac{1}{2}\right) \sqrt{2\pi} \right)- \operatorname {erf} \left( \left(j-\frac{1}{2}\right) \sqrt{2\pi} \right) \right]
&amp;\approx 0.3226\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

The entropic uncertainty is indeed larger than the limiting value.
:&lt;math&gt;H_x+H_p \approx 0.3226 + 0.3226 = 0.6452 &gt;\ln\left(\frac{e}{2}\right)-\ln 1 \approx 0.3069&lt;/math&gt;

Note that despite being in the optimal case, the inequality is not saturated.

!Sinc function example
|-
|An example of a unimodal distribution with infinite variance is the [[sinc function]]. If the wave function is the correctly normalized uniform distribution,
:&lt;math&gt;
\psi(x)=\begin{cases}
\frac{1}{\sqrt{2a}} &amp; \text{for } |x| \le a, \\[8pt]
0 &amp; \text{for } |x|&gt;a
\end{cases}
&lt;/math&gt;
then its Fourier transform is the sinc function,
:&lt;math&gt;\varphi(p)=\sqrt{\frac{a}{\pi \hbar}} \cdot \operatorname{sinc}\left(\frac{a p}{\hbar}\right)&lt;/math&gt;
which yields infinite momentum variance despite having a centralized shape. The entropic uncertainty, on the other hand, is finite. Suppose for simplicity that the spatial resolution is just a two-bin measurement, ''δx''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''a'', and that the momentum resolution is ''δp''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''h''/''a''.

Partitioning the uniform spatial distribution into two equal bins is straightforward. We set the offset ''c''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;1/2 so that the two bins span the distribution.
:&lt;math&gt;\operatorname P[x_0] = \int_{-a}^0 \frac{1}{2a} \, dx = \frac{1}{2}&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\operatorname P[x_1] = \int_0^a \frac{1}{2a} \, dx = \frac{1}{2}&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;H_x = -\sum_{j=0}^{1} \operatorname P[x_j] \ln \operatorname P[x_j] = -\frac{1}{2} \ln \frac{1}{2} - \frac{1}{2} \ln \frac{1}{2} = \ln 2&lt;/math&gt;

The bins for momentum must cover the entire real line. As done with the spatial distribution, we could apply an offset. It turns out, however, that the Shannon entropy is minimized when the zeroth bin for momentum is centered at the origin. (The reader is encouraged to try adding an offset.) The probability of lying within an arbitrary momentum bin can be expressed in terms of the [[sine integral]].

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}\operatorname P[p_j] &amp;= \frac{a}{\pi \hbar} \int_{(j-1/2)\delta p}^{(j+1/2)\delta p} \operatorname{sinc}^2\left(\frac{a p}{\hbar}\right) \, dp \\
&amp;= \frac{1}{\pi} \int_{2\pi (j-1/2)}^{2\pi (j+1/2)} \operatorname{sinc}^2(u) \, du \\
&amp;= \frac{1}{\pi} \left[ \operatorname {Si} ((4j+2)\pi)- \operatorname {Si} ((4j-2)\pi) \right]\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

The Shannon entropy can be evaluated numerically.
:&lt;math&gt;H_p = -\sum_{j=-\infty}^\infty \operatorname P[p_j] \ln \operatorname P[p_j] = -\operatorname P[p_0] \ln \operatorname P[p_0]-2 \cdot \sum_{j=1}^{\infty} \operatorname P[p_j] \ln \operatorname P[p_j] \approx 0.53&lt;/math&gt;

The entropic uncertainty is indeed larger than the limiting value.
:&lt;math&gt;H_x+H_p \approx 0.69 + 0.53 = 1.22 &gt;\ln\left(\frac{e}{2}\right)-\ln 1 \approx 0.31&lt;/math&gt;

==Harmonic analysis==
{{main article|Fourier transform#Uncertainty principle}}
In the context of [[harmonic analysis]], a branch of mathematics, the uncertainty principle implies that one cannot at the same time localize the value of a function and its [[Fourier transform]]. To wit, the following inequality holds,
:&lt;math&gt;\left(\int_{-\infty}^\infty x^2 |f(x)|^2\,dx\right)\left(\int_{-\infty}^\infty \xi^2 |\hat{f}(\xi)|^2\,d\xi\right)\ge \frac{\|f\|_2^4}{16\pi^2}.&lt;/math&gt;

Further mathematical uncertainty inequalities, including the above [[entropic uncertainty]], hold between a function {{mvar|f}} and its Fourier transform {{math| ƒ̂}}:&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|first1=V.|last1=Havin|first2= B.|last2=Jöricke|title=The Uncertainty Principle in Harmonic Analysis|publisher=Springer-Verlag|year=1994}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

===Signal processing {{anchor|Gabor limit}}===
In the context of [[signal processing]], and in particular [[time–frequency analysis]], uncertainty principles are referred to as the '''Gabor limit''', after [[Dennis Gabor]], or sometimes the ''Heisenberg–Gabor limit''. The basic result, which follows from "Benedicks's theorem", below, is that a function cannot be both [[time limited]] and [[band limited]] (a function and its Fourier transform cannot both have bounded domain)—see [[Bandlimiting#Bandlimited versus timelimited|bandlimited versus timelimited]]. Thus

: &lt;math&gt;\sigma_t \cdot \sigma_f \ge \frac{1}{4\pi} \approx 0.08 \text{ cycles}&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\sigma_t&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\sigma_f&lt;/math&gt; are the standard deviations of the time and frequency estimates respectively &lt;ref&gt;Matt Hall, [https://agilescientific.com/blog/2014/1/15/what-is-the-gabor-uncertainty-principle.html "What is the Gabor uncertainty principle?"]&lt;/ref&gt;.

Stated alternatively, "One cannot simultaneously sharply localize a signal (function {{mvar|f}} ) in both the [[time domain]] and [[frequency domain]] ({{math| ƒ̂}}, its Fourier transform)".

When applied to filters, the result implies that one cannot achieve high temporal resolution and frequency resolution at the same time; a concrete example are the [[Short-time Fourier transform#Resolution issues|resolution issues of the short-time Fourier transform]]—if one uses a wide window, one achieves good frequency resolution at the cost of temporal resolution, while a narrow window has the opposite trade-off.

Alternate theorems give more precise quantitative results, and, in time–frequency analysis, rather than interpreting the (1-dimensional) time and frequency domains separately, one instead interprets the limit as a lower limit on the support of a function in the (2-dimensional) time–frequency plane. In practice, the Gabor limit limits the ''simultaneous'' time–frequency resolution one can achieve without interference; it is possible to achieve higher resolution, but at the cost of different components of the signal interfering with each other.

===DFT-Uncertainty principle===
There is an uncertainty principle that uses signal sparsity (or the number of non-zero coefficients).&lt;ref name="Donoho"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Donoho |first1=D.L. |last2=Stark |first2=P.B |year=1989 |title=Uncertainty principles and signal recovery |journal=SIAM Journal on Applied Mathematics |volume=49 |issue=3 |pages=906–931 |doi=10.1137/0149053}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Let &lt;math&gt;\left \{ \mathbf{ x_n } \right \} := x_0, x_1, \ldots, x_{N-1}&lt;/math&gt; be a sequence of ''N'' complex numbers and &lt;math&gt;\left \{ \mathbf{X_k} \right \} := X_0, X_1, \ldots, X_{N-1},&lt;/math&gt; its [[discrete Fourier transform]].

Denote by &lt;math&gt;\|x\|_0&lt;/math&gt; the number of non-zero elements in the time sequence &lt;math&gt;x_0,x_1,\ldots,x_{N-1}&lt;/math&gt; and by &lt;math&gt;\|X\|_0&lt;/math&gt; the number of non-zero elements in the frequency sequence &lt;math&gt;X_0,X_1,\ldots,X_{N-1}&lt;/math&gt;. Then,

===Hardy's uncertainty principle===
The mathematician [[G. H. Hardy]] formulated the following uncertainty principle:&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|first=G.H.|last=Hardy|authorlink=G. H.

Specifically, if {{mvar|f}} in &lt;math&gt;L^2(\mathbb{R})&lt;/math&gt; is such that
:&lt;math&gt;|f(x)|\leq C(1+|x|)^Ne^{-a\pi x^2}&lt;/math&gt;
and
:&lt;math&gt;|\hat{f}(\xi)|\leq C(1+|\xi|)^Ne^{-b\pi \xi^2}&lt;/math&gt; (&lt;math&gt;C&gt;0,N&lt;/math&gt; an integer),

then, if {{math|1=''ab'' &gt; 1, ''f'' = 0}}, while if {{math|1=''ab'' = 1}}, then there is a polynomial {{mvar|P}} of degree {{math| ≤ ''N''}} such that

::&lt;math&gt;f(x)=P(x)e^{-a\pi x^2}. &lt;/math&gt;

This was later improved as follows: if &lt;math&gt;f \in L^2(\mathbb{R}^d)&lt;/math&gt; is such that

:&lt;math&gt;\int_{\mathbb{R}^d}\int_{\mathbb{R}^d}|f(x)||\hat{f}(\xi)|\frac{e^{\pi|\langle x,\xi\rangle|}}{(1+|x|+|\xi|)^N} \, dx \, d\xi &lt; +\infty ~,&lt;/math&gt;
then
::&lt;math&gt;f(x)=P(x)e^{-\pi\langle Ax,x\rangle} ~,&lt;/math&gt;
where {{mvar|P}} is a polynomial of degree {{math|(''N'' − ''d'')/2}} and {{mvar|A}} is a real {{math|''d''×''d''}} positive definite matrix.

This result was stated in Beurling's complete works without proof and proved in Hörmander&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|first=L.|last=Hörmander|authorlink=Lars Hörmander|title=A uniqueness theorem of Beurling for Fourier transform pairs|journal= Ark.

==History==
[[Werner Heisenberg]] formulated the uncertainty principle at [[Niels Bohr]]'s institute in Copenhagen, while working on the mathematical foundations of quantum mechanics.&lt;ref&gt;
[http://www.aip.org/history/heisenberg/p08.htm American Physical Society online exhibit on the Uncertainty Principle]&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Heisenbergbohr.jpg|thumb|Werner Heisenberg and Niels Bohr]]
In 1925, following pioneering work with [[Hendrik Kramers]], Heisenberg developed [[matrix mechanics]], which replaced the ad hoc [[old quantum theory]] with modern quantum mechanics. The central premise was that the classical concept of motion does not fit at the quantum level, as [[electron]]s in an atom do not travel on sharply defined orbits. Rather, their motion is smeared out in a strange way: the [[Fourier transform]] of its time dependence only involves those frequencies that could be observed in the quantum jumps of their radiation.

Heisenberg's paper did not admit any unobservable quantities like the exact position of the electron in an orbit at any time; he only allowed the theorist to talk about the Fourier components of the motion. Since the Fourier components were not defined at the classical frequencies, they could not be used to construct an exact [[trajectory]], so that the formalism could not answer certain overly precise questions about where the electron was or how fast it was going.

In March 1926, working in Bohr's institute, Heisenberg realized that the non-[[commutativity]] implies the uncertainty principle. This implication provided a clear physical interpretation for the non-commutativity, and it laid the foundation for what became known as the [[Copenhagen interpretation]] of quantum mechanics. Heisenberg showed that the commutation relation implies an uncertainty, or in Bohr's language a [[complementarity (physics)|complementarity]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |first=Niels |last=Bohr |year=1958 |title=Atomic Physics and Human Knowledge |location=New York |publisher=Wiley |page=38 |isbn= |bibcode=1958AmJPh..26..596B |volume=26 |journal=American Journal of Physics |doi=10.1119/1.1934707 |issue=8 |last2=Noll |first2=Waldemar }}&lt;/ref&gt; Any two variables that do not commute cannot be measured simultaneously—the more precisely one is known, the less precisely the other can be known. Heisenberg wrote:&lt;blockquote&gt;It can be expressed in its simplest form as follows: One can never know with perfect accuracy both of those two important factors which determine the movement of one of the smallest particles—its position and its velocity. It is impossible to determine accurately ''both'' the position and the direction and speed of a particle ''at the same instant''.&lt;ref&gt;Heisenberg, W., ''Die Physik der Atomkerne'', Taylor &amp; Francis, 1952, p. 30.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In his celebrated 1927 paper, "Über den anschaulichen Inhalt der quantentheoretischen Kinematik und Mechanik" ("On the Perceptual Content of Quantum Theoretical Kinematics and Mechanics"), Heisenberg established this expression as the minimum amount of unavoidable momentum disturbance caused by any position measurement,&lt;ref name="Heisenberg_1927"/&gt; but he did not give a precise definition for the uncertainties Δx and Δp. Instead, he gave some plausible estimates in each case separately. In his Chicago lecture&lt;ref name="Heisenberg_1930"&gt;{{Citation |first=W. |last=Heisenberg |year=1930 |title=Physikalische Prinzipien der Quantentheorie  |language=de|location=Leipzig |publisher=Hirzel }} English translation ''The Physical Principles of Quantum Theory''. Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1930.&lt;/ref&gt; he refined his principle:

{{NumBlk|::|&lt;math&gt;\Delta x \, \Delta p\gtrsim h&lt;/math&gt;|1}}

[[Earle Hesse Kennard|Kennard]]&lt;ref name="Kennard" /&gt; in 1927 first proved the modern inequality:

{{NumBlk|::|&lt;math&gt;\sigma_x\sigma_p\ge\frac{\hbar}{2}&lt;/math&gt;|2}}

where {{math|''ħ'' {{=}} {{sfrac|''h''|2{{pi}}}}}}, and {{math|''σ&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;''}}, {{math|''σ&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt;''}} are the standard deviations of position and momentum. Heisenberg only proved relation ({{EquationNote|2}}) for the special case of Gaussian states.&lt;ref name="Heisenberg_1930"/&gt;

===Terminology and translation===
Throughout the main body of his original 1927 paper, written in German, Heisenberg used the word, "Ungenauigkeit" ("indeterminacy"),&lt;ref name="Heisenberg_1927" /&gt;
to describe the basic theoretical principle. Only in the endnote did he switch to the word, "Unsicherheit" ("uncertainty"). When the English-language version of Heisenberg's textbook, ''The Physical Principles of the Quantum Theory'', was published in 1930, however, the translation "uncertainty" was used, and it became the more commonly used term in the English language thereafter.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |first=David |last=Cassidy |year=2009 |title=Beyond Uncertainty: Heisenberg, Quantum Physics, and the Bomb |location= New York |publisher=Bellevue Literary Press |page=185 |isbn= |bibcode=2010PhT....63a..49C |last2=Saperstein |first2=Alvin M. |volume=63 |journal=Physics Today |doi=10.1063/1.3293416 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Heisenberg's microscope===
[[File:Heisenberg gamma ray microscope.svg|thumb|200px|right|Heisenberg's gamma-ray microscope for locating an electron (shown in blue). The incoming gamma ray (shown in green) is scattered by the electron up into the microscope's aperture angle ''θ''. The scattered gamma-ray is shown in red. Classical [[optics]] shows that the electron position can be resolved only up to an uncertainty Δ''x'' that depends on ''θ'' and the wavelength ''λ'' of the incoming light.]]
{{Main article|Heisenberg's microscope}}

The principle is quite counter-intuitive, so the early students of quantum theory had to be reassured that naive measurements to violate it were bound always to be unworkable. One way in which Heisenberg originally illustrated the intrinsic impossibility of violating the uncertainty principle is by utilizing the [[observer effect (physics)|observer effect]] of  an imaginary microscope as a measuring device.&lt;ref name="Heisenberg_1930"/&gt;

He imagines an experimenter trying to measure the position and momentum of an [[electron]] by shooting a [[photon]] at it.&lt;ref name=GreensteinZajonc2006&gt;{{cite book|author1=George Greenstein|author2=Arthur Zajonc|title=The Quantum Challenge: Modern Research on the Foundations of Quantum Mechanics|year=2006|publisher=Jones &amp; Bartlett Learning|isbn=978-0-7637-2470-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|49–50}}
:Problem 1 – If the photon has a short [[wavelength]], and therefore, a large momentum, the position can be measured accurately. But the photon scatters in a random direction, transferring a large and uncertain amount of momentum to the electron. If the photon has a long [[wavelength]] and low momentum, the collision does not disturb the electron's momentum very much, but the scattering will reveal its position only vaguely.

:Problem 2 – If a large [[aperture]] is used for the microscope, the electron's location can be well resolved (see [[Rayleigh criterion]]); but by the principle of [[conservation of momentum]], the transverse momentum of the incoming photon affects the electron's beamline momentum and hence, the new momentum of the electron resolves poorly. If a small aperture is used, the accuracy of both resolutions is the other way around.

The combination of these trade-offs implies that no matter what photon wavelength and aperture size are used, the product of the uncertainty in measured position and measured momentum is greater than or equal to a lower limit, which is (up to a small numerical factor) equal to [[Planck's constant]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last=Tipler |first=Paul A. |first2=Ralph A. |last2=Llewellyn |title=Modern Physics |edition=3rd |publisher=W. H. Freeman and Co. |year=1999 |isbn=1-57259-164-1 |chapter=5–5 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Heisenberg did not care to formulate the uncertainty principle as an exact limit (which is elaborated below), and preferred to use it instead, as a heuristic quantitative statement, correct up to small numerical factors, which makes the radically new noncommutativity of quantum mechanics inevitable.

==Critical reactions==
{{Main article|Bohr–Einstein debates}}

The Copenhagen interpretation of quantum mechanics and Heisenberg's Uncertainty Principle were, in fact, seen as twin targets by detractors who believed in an underlying [[determinism]] and [[Scientific realism|realism]]. According to the [[Copenhagen interpretation]] of quantum mechanics, there is no fundamental reality that the [[quantum state]] describes, just a prescription for calculating experimental results. There is no way to say what the state of a system fundamentally is, only what the result of observations might be.

[[Albert Einstein]] believed that randomness is a reflection of our ignorance of some fundamental property of reality, while [[Niels Bohr]] believed that the probability distributions are fundamental and irreducible, and depend on which measurements we choose to perform. [[Bohr–Einstein debates|Einstein and Bohr debated]] the uncertainty principle for many years.

===The ideal of the detached observer===
[[Wolfgang Pauli]] called Einstein's fundamental objection to the uncertainty principle "the ideal of the detached observer" (phrase translated from the German):
{{blockquote|"Like the moon has a definite position" Einstein said to me last winter, "whether or not we look at the moon, the same must also hold for the atomic objects, as there is no sharp distinction possible between these and macroscopic objects. Observation cannot ''create'' an element of reality like a position, there must be something contained in the complete description of physical reality which corresponds to the ''possibility'' of observing a position, already before the observation has been actually made." I hope, that I quoted Einstein correctly; it is always difficult to quote somebody out of memory with whom one does not agree. It is precisely this kind of postulate which I call the ideal of the detached observer.

===Einstein's slit===
The first of Einstein's [[thought experiment]]s challenging the uncertainty principle went as follows:

:Consider a particle passing through a slit of width {{mvar|d}}. The slit introduces an uncertainty in momentum of approximately {{mvar|{{sfrac|h|d}}}} because the particle passes through the wall. But let us determine the momentum of the particle by measuring the recoil of the wall. In doing so, we find the momentum of the particle to arbitrary accuracy by conservation of momentum.

Bohr's response was that the wall is quantum mechanical as well, and that to measure the recoil to accuracy {{math|Δ''p''}}, the momentum of the wall must be known to this accuracy before the particle passes through. This introduces an uncertainty in the position of the wall and therefore the position of the slit equal to {{math|{{sfrac|''h''|Δ''p''}}}}, and if the wall's momentum is known precisely enough to measure the recoil, the slit's position is uncertain enough to disallow a position measurement.

A similar analysis with particles diffracting through multiple slits is given by [[Richard Feynman]].&lt;ref&gt;Feynman lectures on Physics, vol 3, 2–2&lt;/ref&gt;

===Einstein's box===
Bohr was present when Einstein proposed the thought experiment which has become known as [[Einstein's box]]. Einstein argued that "Heisenberg's uncertainty equation implied that the uncertainty in time was related to the uncertainty in energy, the product of the two being related to [[Planck's constant]]."&lt;ref name="Gamow"&gt;Gamow, G., ''The great physicists from Galileo to Einstein'', Courier Dover, 1988, p.260.&lt;/ref&gt; Consider, he said, an ideal box, lined with mirrors so that it can contain light indefinitely. The box could be weighed before a clockwork mechanism opened an ideal shutter at a chosen instant to allow one single photon to escape. "We now know, explained Einstein, precisely the time at which the photon left the box."&lt;ref&gt;Kumar, M., ''Quantum: Einstein, Bohr and the Great Debate About the Nature of Reality'', Icon, 2009, p. 282.&lt;/ref&gt; "Now, weigh the box again. The change of mass tells the energy of the emitted light. In this manner, said Einstein, one could measure the energy emitted and the time it was released with any desired precision, in contradiction to the uncertainty principle."&lt;ref name="Gamow" /&gt;

Bohr spent a sleepless night considering this argument, and eventually realized that it was flawed. He pointed out that if the box were to be weighed, say by a spring and a pointer on a scale, "since the box must move vertically with a change in its weight, there will be uncertainty in its vertical velocity and therefore an uncertainty in its height above the table. ... Furthermore, the uncertainty about the elevation above the earth's surface will result in an uncertainty in the rate of the clock,"&lt;ref&gt;Gamow, G., ''The great physicists from Galileo to Einstein'', Courier Dover, 1988, p. 260–261.&lt;/ref&gt; because of Einstein's own theory of [[Gravitational time dilation|gravity's effect on time]].
"Through this chain of uncertainties, Bohr showed that Einstein's light box experiment could not simultaneously measure exactly both the energy of the photon and the time of its escape."&lt;ref&gt;Kumar, M., ''Quantum: Einstein, Bohr and the Great Debate About the Nature of Reality'', Icon, 2009, p. 287.&lt;/ref&gt;

===EPR paradox for entangled particles===
Bohr was compelled to modify his understanding of the uncertainty principle after another thought experiment by Einstein. In 1935, Einstein, Podolsky and Rosen (see [[EPR paradox]]) published an analysis of widely separated [[Quantum entanglement|entangled]] particles. Measuring one particle, Einstein realized, would alter the probability distribution of the other, yet here the other particle could not possibly be disturbed. This example led Bohr to revise his understanding of the principle, concluding that the uncertainty was not caused by a direct interaction.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |first=Walter |last=Isaacson |year=2007 |title=Einstein: His Life and Universe |location=New York |publisher=Simon &amp; Schuster |page=452 |isbn=978-0-7432-6473-0 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

But Einstein came to much more far-reaching conclusions from the same thought experiment. He believed the "natural basic assumption" that a complete description of reality would have to predict the results of experiments from "locally changing deterministic quantities" and therefore would have to include more information than the maximum possible allowed by the uncertainty principle.

In 1964, [[John Stewart Bell|John Bell]] showed that this assumption can be falsified, since it would imply a certain inequality between the probabilities of different experiments. Experimental results confirm the predictions of quantum mechanics, ruling out Einstein's basic assumption that led him to the suggestion of his ''hidden variables''. These hidden variables may be "hidden" because of an illusion that occurs during observations of objects that are too large or too small.  This illusion can be likened to rotating fan blades that seem to pop in and out of existence at different locations and sometimes seem to be in the same place at the same time when observed.  This same illusion manifests itself in the observation of subatomic particles.  Both the fan blades and the subatomic particles are moving so fast that the illusion is seen by the observer.  Therefore, it is possible that there would be predictability of the subatomic particles behavior and characteristics to a recording device capable of very high speed tracking....Ironically this fact is one of the best pieces of evidence supporting [[Karl Popper]]'s philosophy of [[Falsifiability|invalidation of a theory by falsification-experiments]]. That is to say, here Einstein's "basic assumption" became falsified by [[Bell test experiments|experiments based on Bell's inequalities]]. For the objections of Karl Popper to the Heisenberg inequality itself, see below.

While it is possible to assume that quantum mechanical predictions are due to nonlocal, hidden variables, and in fact [[David Bohm]] invented such a formulation, this resolution is not satisfactory to the vast majority of physicists. The question of whether a random outcome is predetermined by a nonlocal theory can be philosophical, and it can be potentially intractable. If the hidden variables are not constrained, they could just be a list of random digits that are used to produce the measurement outcomes. To make it sensible, the assumption of nonlocal hidden variables is sometimes augmented by a second assumption—that the [[size of the observable universe]] puts a limit on the computations that these variables can do. A nonlocal theory of this sort predicts that a [[quantum computer]] would encounter fundamental obstacles when attempting to factor numbers of approximately 10,000 digits or more; a potentially [[Shor's algorithm|achievable task]] in quantum mechanics.&lt;ref&gt;[[Gerardus 't Hooft]] has at times advocated this point of view.&lt;/ref&gt;{{full citation needed|date=February 2017}}

=== Popper's criticism ===
{{main article|Popper's experiment}}
[[Karl Popper]] approached the problem of indeterminacy as a logician and [[Philosophical realism|metaphysical realist]].&lt;ref name="Popper1959"&gt;{{Citation | last1 = Popper | first1 = Karl | authorlink1 = Karl Popper | title = [[The Logic of Scientific Discovery]] | publisher = Hutchinson &amp; Co. | year = 1959}}&lt;/ref&gt; He disagreed with the application of the uncertainty relations to individual particles rather than to [[Quantum ensemble|ensembles]] of identically prepared particles, referring to them as "statistical scatter relations".&lt;ref name="Popper1959" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Jarvie2006"&gt;{{Citation | last1 = Jarvie | first1 = Ian Charles | last2 = Milford | first2 = Karl | last3 = Miller | first3 = David W | title = Karl Popper: a centenary assessment, | volume = 3 | publisher = Ashgate Publishing | year = 2006 | isbn = 978-0-7546-5712-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this statistical interpretation, a ''particular'' measurement may be made to arbitrary precision without invalidating the quantum theory. This directly contrasts with the [[Copenhagen interpretation]] of quantum mechanics, which is [[Determinism|non-deterministic]] but lacks local hidden variables.

In 1934, Popper published ''Zur Kritik der Ungenauigkeitsrelationen'' (''Critique of the Uncertainty Relations'') in ''[[Naturwissenschaften]]'',&lt;ref name="Popper1934"&gt;{{Citation | title = Zur Kritik der Ungenauigkeitsrelationen (Critique of the Uncertainty Relations) | journal = Naturwissenschaften | year = 1934 | first = Karl | last = Popper | author2 = Carl Friedrich von Weizsäcker | volume = 22 | issue = 48 | pages = 807–808 | doi=10.1007/BF01496543|bibcode = 1934NW.....22..807P | postscript = . }}&lt;/ref&gt; and in the same year ''[[The Logic of Scientific Discovery|Logik der Forschung]]'' (translated and updated by the author as ''The Logic of Scientific Discovery'' in 1959), outlining his arguments for the statistical interpretation. In 1982, he further developed his theory in ''Quantum theory and the schism in Physics'', writing:
&lt;blockquote&gt;[Heisenberg's] formulae are, beyond all doubt, derivable ''statistical formulae'' of the quantum theory. But they have been ''habitually misinterpreted'' by those quantum theorists who said that these formulae can be interpreted as determining some upper limit to the ''precision of our measurements''. [original emphasis]&lt;ref&gt;Popper, K. ''Quantum theory and the schism in Physics'', Unwin Hyman Ltd, 1982, pp. 53–54.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Popper proposed an experiment to [[Falsifiability|falsify]] the uncertainty relations, although he later withdrew his initial version after discussions with [[Carl Friedrich von Weizsäcker|Weizsäcker]], [[Werner Heisenberg|Heisenberg]], and [[Albert Einstein|Einstein]]; this experiment may have influenced the formulation of the [[EPR paradox|EPR experiment]].&lt;ref name="Popper1959" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Mehra2001"&gt;{{Citation | last1 = Mehra | first1 = Jagdish | last2 = Rechenberg | first2 = Helmut | title = The Historical Development of Quantum Theory | publisher = Springer | year = 2001 | isbn = 978-0-387-95086-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Many-worlds uncertainty ===
{{main article|Many-worlds interpretation}}

The [[many-worlds interpretation]] originally outlined by [[Hugh Everett III]] in 1957 is partly meant to reconcile the differences between Einstein's and Bohr's views by replacing Bohr's [[wave function collapse]] with an ensemble of deterministic and independent universes whose ''distribution'' is governed by [[wave function]]s and the [[Schrödinger equation]]. Thus, uncertainty in the many-worlds interpretation follows from each observer within any universe having no knowledge of what goes on in the other universes.

=== Free will ===

Some scientists including [[Arthur Compton]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1126/science.74.1911.172| title = The Uncertainty Principle and Free Will| journal = Science| volume = 74| issue = 1911| pages = 172| year = 1931| last1 = Compton | first1 = A. H. | pmid=17808216|bibcode = 1931Sci....74..172C }}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Martin Heisenberg]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1038/459164a| title = Is free will an illusion?| journal = Nature| volume = 459| issue = 7244| pages = 164–165| year = 2009| last1 = Heisenberg | first1 = M. |bibcode = 2009Natur.459..164H }}&lt;/ref&gt; have suggested that the uncertainty principle, or at least the general probabilistic nature of quantum mechanics, could be evidence for the two-stage model of free will. One critique, however, is that apart from the basic role of quantum mechanics as a foundation for chemistry, [[Quantum biology|nontrivial biological mechanisms requiring quantum mechanics]] are unlikely, due to the rapid [[decoherence]] time of quantum systems at room temperature.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1016/j.biosystems.2004.07.001| pmid = 15555759| title = Does quantum mechanics play a non-trivial role in life?| journal = Biosystems| volume = 78| issue = 1–3| pages = 69–79| year = 2004| last1 = Davies | first1 = P. C. W. }}&lt;/ref&gt; The standard view, however, is that this decoherence is  overcome by both screening and decoherence-free subspaces found in biological cells.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

==The second law of thermodynamics==

There is reason to believe that violating the uncertainty principle also strongly implies the violation of the [[second law of thermodynamics]].&lt;ref&gt;E. Hanggi, S. Wehner, A violation of the uncertainty principle also implies the violation of the second law of thermodynamics; 2012, arXiv:1205.6894v1 (quant-phy).&lt;/ref&gt;
