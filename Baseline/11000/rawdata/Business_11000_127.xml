'''Actelion''' is a pharmaceuticals and biotechnology company established in December 1997, headquartered in Allschwil near Basel in Switzerland.&lt;ref name=fierce&gt;{{cite web|title=Johnson &amp; Johnson scraps phase 3 antibiotic program acquired in $30B Actelion takeover|url=https://www.fiercebiotech.com/biotech/j-j-scraps-phase-3-antibiotic-program-acquired-30b-actelion-takeover|first1=Nick Paul|last1=Taylor|date=17 April 2018|access-date=5 July 2018|publisher=Fierce Biotech}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Actelion specializes in [[orphan diseases]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Medicine|url = http://www.medterms.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=11418}}&lt;/ref&gt; Actelion scientists were among the first to work in the field of endothelian receptor antagonists.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Businessweek|url=http://investing.businessweek.com/research/stocks/snapshot/snapshot.asp?ticker=ATLN:VX}}&lt;/ref&gt; The company name might be a reminder for its first product, an endothelian receptor antagonist and the verb "action", "act upon". Actelion was initially financed with [[venture capital]] provided through a syndicate including Atlas Venture, [[Sofinnova]] and [[HealthCap]].

Actelion has 29 operative affiliates around the world, including the United States, Canada, Brazil, Australia, Japan, Switzerland and a number of EU countries.
The Swiss affiliate is located in Baden, the German affiliate in [[Freiburg]], the Austrian one in [[Vienna]], the French one in [[Paris]] and the UK affiliate is located in [[London]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Actelion affiliates|url=http://www.pah-info.com/Affiliates}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2006, the company established the Actelion Endothelin Research Award programme which supports selected clinical research projects.

In January 2017, [[Johnson &amp; Johnson]] announced that it would purchase the company for $30 billion.&lt;ref name=wsj-rockoff&gt;{{Citation

'''Ahmet Reyiz Yılmaz''' (born 4 August 1968 in [[Rize]]) is a Turkish [[businessman]], [[economist]], leader of the Conservative Ascention Party.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.milliyet.com.tr/myp-genel-baskani-ahmet-reyiz-yilmaz-ankara-yerelhaber-1240811/|title=MYP GENEL BAŞKANI AHMET REYİZ YILMAZ, MHP’DEKİ MUHALİF HAREKETLERE İLİŞKİN DEĞERLENDİRMELERDE BULUNDU - Ankara Haberleri - Milliyet Ankara|language=Turkish|accessdate=6 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Yılmaz is a graduate of the [[Anadolu University]] Department of Economics and Administrative Sciences. He has participated in many certified programs on the '''Business Management''' abroad and in panels as a [[Middle East]] expert. He is the writer Of the book which he published in 2012 the name of '''''"Abraham’s Fight, The Turkish-Islamic case/ Realities Of İsraelities"'''''

He also speaks [[English language|English]] and [[Hebrew]].

== Professional life ==

In 1988, he was involved in mid level construction work. In 1992, he went to [[Israel]] for business. A short time later he returned and continued to work in the family construction company that they had established in [[Turkey]].

Ahmet Reyiz Yılmaz, who undertook his first project abroad in Israel in 1994 followed by many other successful international projects that he accomplished by establishing his own company, was on the cover of Israel’s largest Globes magazine read by Jews worldwide with the title of “The Last Remaining Ottoman in Israel”. Yılmaz received this title with many accomplished works left behind him in various points throughout Israel during a 16-year process. One of these projects is the [[Azrieli Center]], the tallest business center in the Middle East. During the 1996 term Yılmaz established the Israel Turkish Contractors Union together with the Israel-Turkey Attaché. Currently he is producing construction, contract and investment projects in Israel, Poland, Romania and Turkey.

== Entry into politics ==

As the result of an invitation from then [[Nationalist Movement Party|MHP]] (MHP) Group Deputy Leader and Erzurum Parliamentarian [[İsmail Köse]] to join MHP, Ahmet Reyiz Yılmaz met with MHP General Leader [[Devlet Bahçeli]]. After this meeting, on the approval and recommendation of Bahçeli, he became a party member from the province of Çankaya in 2005. Between the years of 2005-2006, Yılmaz accomplished  important works in the MHP General Headquarters, the [[TBMM]] (Grand National Assembly of Turkey) and the Government Monitoring Committee, in charge of economy and foreign politics under the leadership of Köse.
He resigned his duty from this party. His ideas were collected by himself in his well-known book '' Abraham Fight Turkish Islamic Case''.

== Contributions to Turkish history in Israel ==

Yılmaz has provided many cultural services in Israel for the purpose of contributing to the assets of Turkey. One of the most significant ones is the restoration to the original form of the Turkish Governor’s Mansion (the Government Building of the time), which had been demolished with bombs by the British and local insurgents after the land, which is now Israel, had been handed over by the Ottomans with a flag transfer to the British in 1917; and its delivery to the [[Turkish Embassy]] with the [[Turkish flag]] installed at the front.

Additionally many monuments were made to revitalize the [[Turkey|Turkish]] and [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] footprints in Israel.

== Successes and awards ==

In 2005, he and his company were chosen from among 400 local Israeli businessmen and companies by the Israel Business Commission as “The Best Company of the Year” and “Businessman of the Year”.

In 2008, he was selected by Turkish magazine Ekovitrin as the most successful businessman of the year and won their “Star of the Year” award in Israel.

'''Albert Davis Lasker''' (May 1, 1880 – May 30, 1952) was an American businessman who played a major role in shaping modern [[advertising]]. He was raised in [[Galveston, Texas]], where his father was the president of several banks. Moving to Chicago, he became a partner in the advertising firm of [[Lord &amp; Thomas]]. He purchased and led many successful ad campaigns. He made new use of radio, changing popular culture and appealing to consumers' psychology. A Republican, he designed new ways to advertise election campaigns, especially the [[United States presidential election, 1920#Return to normalcy|Warren Harding campaign of 1920]], and became a philanthropist.

==Early life and career==
Lasker was born to a [[German Jews|Jewish]] family&lt;ref name=JVL&gt;[http://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/advertising Jewish Virtual Library: "Modern Jewish History: Advertising"] retrieved July 5, 2017&lt;/ref&gt; the son of Morris and Nettie Lasker in [[Freiburg im Breisgau|Freiburg]], [[German Empire|Germany]] in 1880. Morris had emigrated from Prussia in 1840, while Lasker's mother was an American citizen. They lived in [[Galveston, Texas]], but Morris had moved Nettie to Germany during her pregnancy for better medical care. The family returned to Galveston within six months, and Lasker spent the rest of his childhood in Texas.&lt;ref name="ImmEntrpLasker"&gt;Morello, John A.. [http://www.immigrantentrepreneurship.org/entry.php?rec=57 "Albert Lasker."] In ''Immigrant Entrepreneurship: German-American Business Biographies, 1720 to the Present'', vol. 4, edited by Jeffrey Fear. German Historical Institute. Last modified June 26, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

Lasker started working as a [[newspaper]] [[reporter]] while he was still a teenager. He assisted the successful Congressional campaign of the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] [[Robert B. Hawley|Robert Hawley]] in 1896.&lt;ref name="anbhf" /&gt; Although Texas politics had been dominated by the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]] since shortly after [[Reconstruction era (United States)|Reconstruction]], in this election, many voters split between the Democrats and the [[Populist Party (United States)|Populist Party]], and Hawley won with less than 50% of the votes.

In 1898 his father, who disapproved of journalism,&lt;ref name="ImmEntrpLasker"/&gt; persuaded Lasker to move to [[Chicago]] to try an [[advertising]] position at [[Lord &amp; Thomas]].&lt;ref name="anbhf" /&gt; After he worked as an office boy for a year, one of the agency's salesmen left, and Lasker acquired his territory. During this time, Lasker created his first [[advertising campaign|campaign]]. He hired a friend, Eugene Katz, to write the copy for a series of Wilson Ear Drum Company ads. They featured a photograph of a man cupping his ear. George Wilson, president of the Ear Drum company, adopted the ads and his sales increased.

When Lord retired in 1903, Lasker purchased his share and became a partner.&lt;ref name="anbhf"&gt;[http://www.anbhf.org/laureates/lasker.html American National Business Hall of Fame] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100111054458/http://www.anbhf.org/laureates/lasker.html |date=2010-01-11 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He purchased the firm in 1912 at the age of 32.

Chicago, along with New York, was the center of the nation's advertising industry. Lasker, known as the "father of modern advertising," &lt;ref&gt;Wolfgang Saxon, "Emerson Foote, 85, Who Headed Large Advertising Agencies, Dies", The New York Times [https://www.nytimes.com/1992/07/08/nyregion/emerson-foote-85-who-headed-large-advertising-agencies-dies.html]&lt;/ref&gt; made Chicago his base 1898–1942. As head of the [[Draftfcb|Lord and Thomas agency]], Lasker devised a copywriting technique that appealed directly to the psychology of the consumer. Women seldom smoked cigarettes; he told them if they smoked [[Lucky Strikes]] they could stay slender. Lasker's use of radio, particularly with his campaigns for [[Palmolive (soap)|Palmolive]] soap, [[Pepsodent]] toothpaste, [[Kotex]] products, and Lucky Strike cigarettes, not only revolutionized the advertising industry but also significantly changed popular culture.&lt;ref&gt;Arthur W. Schultz, "Albert Lasker's Advertising Revolution," ''Chicago History,'' Nov 2002, Vol. 31#2 pp. 36–53&lt;/ref&gt;

===Salesmanship in print===
Lasker had an inquiring mind about what advertising was and how it worked. In 1904 he met John E. Kennedy, a former [[Royal Canadian Mounted Police|Canadian mounted policeman]] who had entered advertising. Lasker believed that advertising was news, but Kennedy said, "[N]ews is a technique of presentation, but advertising is a very simple thing. I can give it to you in three words, it is 'salesmanship in print'".&lt;ref&gt;Jeffrey L. Cruikshank &amp; Arthur W. Schultz, ''The Man Who Sold America,'' pp. 54–56&lt;/ref&gt;

The pair used this concept with [[Whirlpool Corporation|the 1900 Washer Co.]] (later Whirlpool). Their campaign was so successful that, within four months of running the first ad, they attracted additional clients and their "advertising spend" went from $15,000 a year to $30,000 a month. Within six months, their firm was one of the three or four largest advertising agencies in the nation.

In 1908 Lasker recruited [[Claude C. Hopkins]] to the firm, specifically to work on the Van Camp Packaging Company ([[Van Camp's]]) account. The relationship lasted for 17 years. Lasker helped create America's infatuation with [[orange juice]]. Lord &amp; Thomas acquired the [[Sunkist Growers, Incorporated]] account in 1908, when Lasker was 28. The citrus industry was in a slump, and [[California]] growers were producing so many [[orange (fruit)|oranges]] that they were cutting down trees in order to limit supply. Lasker created campaigns that not only encouraged consumers to eat oranges, but also to drink orange juice. He was able to increase consumption enough so that the growers stopped chopping down their groves.&lt;ref&gt;John Gunther, ''Taken at the Flood,'' p. 72&lt;/ref&gt;

Among Lasker's pioneering contributions was the introduction into public schools of classes that explained to young girls about puberty and [[menstruation]] (done to promote [[Kotex]] [[tampons]]). He is also credited as the creator of the [[soap opera]] genre, and using radio and television as media driven by advertising.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Heinrich|first1=Thomas|last2=Batchelor|first2=Bob|title=Kotex, Kleenex, Huggies: Kimberly-Clark and the Consumer Revolution in American Business|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xlPNB5HpRDIC&amp;pg=PA83|year=2004|publisher=Ohio State University Press|page=83}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Cruikshank|first1=Jeffrey L.|last2=Schultz|first2=Arthur|title=The Man Who Sold America: The Amazing (but True!)

==Business interests==
Lasker was an early owner of the [[Chicago Cubs]] [[baseball]] team. He acquired an interest in the team in 1916 and soon purchased majority control. He originated the Lasker Plan, a report that recommended baseball's governing authority be reformed. This led to the creation of the office of the [[Commissioner of Baseball]]. Lasker, along with his business partner [[Charles Weeghman]], are credited with moving the Cubs into the club's current home, [[Wrigley Field]]. In 1925, he sold the team to one of his minor partners, [[William Wrigley Jr.]]

Lasker became the second-largest shareholder in the [[Pepsodent]] company,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,793010-4,00.html "CORPORATIONS: Old Empire, New Prince"], ''TIME''&lt;/ref&gt; which had become an L&amp;T client in 1916. It was sold to [[Lever Brothers]] in 1944.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.anbhf.org/lasker_ads.html Albert Lasker Ad Samples] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120503060533/http://www.anbhf.org/lasker_ads.html |date=2012-05-03 }}, American National Business Hall of Fame&lt;/ref&gt;

After developing a private estate, Mill Road Farm, in [[Lake Forest, Illinois|Lake Forest]], [[Illinois]], Lasker had a [[golf course]] built on it. The ''[[National Golf Review]]'' in 1939 rated the Lasker Golf Course as No. 23 on its list of "Top 100 Courses in the World." Following the [[Great Depression]], Lasker donated the entire property to the [[University of Chicago]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Phil Kosin]], [http://www.chicagolandgolf.com/ghostcourse1.html  "Ghost Courses"],  ''Chicagoland Golf''&lt;/ref&gt;

==Politics==
Lasker continued to be active in the Republican Party, and showed the party how to use modern advertising techniques to sell their candidates.  He was a key advisor in the 1920 Harding campaign, which resulted in one of the largest landslides in history, as [[Warren G. Harding]] appealed for votes in newsreels, billboards and newspaper ads.&lt;ref&gt;John A. Morello, ''Selling the President, 1920: Albert D. Lasker, Advertising, and the Election of Warren G. Harding'' (2001)&lt;/ref&gt;

On June 9, 1921 President Harding's appointment of Lasker as chairman of the [[United States Shipping Board]] was confirmed by the US Senate. Lasker took the job on the condition that he would serve no more than two years. At the time, he was only the third man of Jewish descent to have been appointed to such a high post in the federal government.&lt;ref name="Cruikshank 2010 pp. 199"&gt;Cruikshank &amp; Shultz (2010), ''The Man Who Sold America'', pp. 199–204&lt;/ref&gt; Lasker inherited a large mess, with over 2,300 ships under Shipping Board control losing money every day. A full quarter of the fleet were wooden hulled, and by this time were obsolete.&lt;ref name="Cruikshank 2010 pp. 199"/&gt; He disposed of useless ships at an average price of $30 a ton, incurring criticism from Congress for "throwing our ships away".

His accomplishments included the refitting of the ''[[SS Leviathan]]'' for passenger service, as well as originating ship-to-shore telephone services.&lt;ref&gt;John Gunther(1960), ''Taken at the Flood'', p. 132&lt;/ref&gt; Lasker, who had no previous experience in the shipping business before his appointment, true to his word, ended his service in office on July 1, 1923.&lt;ref&gt;Werner (1935), ''Privileged Characters'', pp. 328–329&lt;/ref&gt;

==Later years==
[[File:Albert Lasker Mausoleum 2010.JPG|thumb|The mausoleum of Albert Lasker]]
After 30 years as its [[chief executive]], Lasker sold the firm to three senior executives. It became [[Foote, Cone &amp; Belding]] in 1942.&lt;ref name="anbhf"/&gt;

Lasker married thrice. In 1902, he married Flora Warner. The couple had three children before her death in 1934: Mary Lasker Block (born 1904). [[Edward Lasker (businessman)|Edward Lasker]] (born 1912), and [[Frances Lasker Brody]] (born 1916).&lt;ref name="ImmEntrpLasker"/&gt; In 1938, he married actress [[Doris Kenyon]] but the marriage ended in divorce a year later.&lt;ref name=ImmEntrpLasker /&gt; Lasker — and especially his third wife [[Mary Lasker]] (married 1940) — were nationally prominent philanthropists. They played major roles in promoting and expanding the [[National Institutes of Health]], helping its budget expand from $2.4 million in 1945 to $5.5 billion in 1985.&lt;ref&gt;Joel L. Fleishman, et al. ''Casebook for the Foundation: A Great American Secret '' (2007) p. 50&lt;/ref&gt; They founded and endowed the [[Lasker Award]], which has recognized the work of many leading scientists and researchers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://history.nih.gov/exhibits/history/docs/page_06.html |title=A Short History of the National Institutes of Health |publisher=History.nih.gov |date= |accessdate=2012-11-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On May 30, 1952, Lasker died in New York at the age of 72.&lt;ref name="anbhf"/&gt; He was interred in a private mausoleum at [[Sleepy Hollow Cemetery]] in [[Sleepy Hollow, New York|Sleepy Hollow]].

==Bipolar disorder==
The book "The Man Who Sold America" posits that Lasker had [[Bipolar II disorder]], which affected his personal and work life. Lasker operated at a high energy level. He was frequently expansive, irritable, highly verbal, intensely creative, and insomniac—all symptoms of a condition that today would be called [[hypomania]]. He never ascended to the level of mania that is generally associated with manic depression, or—again in today’s vocabulary—a bipolar I disorder, although he sometimes behaved erratically, especially under the influence of alcohol.  Most likely, he was afflicted by a bipolar II disorder. Recent research suggests that there is an increased risk of bipolar II disorder among people whose family members suffer from the disorder. [[Eduard Lasker]], Albert’s uncle, seems to have had depressive episodes. Morris, too, may have experienced depressions: his rollercoaster financial affairs may have had their root, in part, in some sort of affective illness. Finally, the diagnosis is supported by Lasker’s age when the apparent ailment overtook him. Bipolar I—the affective state that is accompanied by wild, manic excess—usually first manifests itself in the teenage years, while the more subtle, hypomanic form of the illness often stays masked until the mid- or late twenties. Lasker was stricken at age twenty-seven.&lt;ref&gt;Jeffrey L. Cruikshank &amp; Arthur W. Schultz. “The Man Who Sold America.” Harvard Business Review Press, 2010-07-01&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Andreas Marcus Kaplan''' (born October 5, 1977) is [[Professor]] of [[Marketing]] at the [[ESCP Europe]] Business School. He is specialized in the areas of [[social media]], [[viral marketing]], and the digital world in general.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |last= |title= How Has Social Media Changed Us |newspaper= [[The Nation]] |subscription= yes |via=[[HighBeam Research]] |accessdate= August 23, 2014 |date= November 14, 2013 |first= |url= http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-349568980.html }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Life==
Kaplan was born on October 5, 1977 and grew up in [[Munich]], [[Germany]]. His mother is Anneliese Kaplan (dressmaker) and his father Vincenc Kaplan (locksmith).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url= https://cgi.marquiswhoswho.com/OnDemand/Default.aspx?last_name=Kaplan&amp;first_name=Andreas |title=Marquis Who’s Who in the World|publisher=[[Marquis Who's Who]]}}{{Subscription required}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{better source|date=August 2014}}

Professor Kaplan holds a [[Master of Public Administration]] from the [[École Nationale d'Administration]], an MSc from [[ESCP Europe]], and a BSc from the [[Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich]]. He completed his [[Habilitation]] at the [[Sorbonne]] and his Ph.D. at the [[University of Cologne]] in cooperation with [[HEC Paris]]. Kaplan was visiting Ph.D. at [[INSEAD]] and participated in the International Teachers Programme at the [[Kellogg School of Management]], [[Northwestern University]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url= https://cgi.marquiswhoswho.com/OnDemand/Default.aspx?last_name=Kaplan&amp;first_name=Andreas |title=Marquis Who’s Who in the World|publisher=[[Marquis Who's Who]]}}{{Subscription required}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Before joining ESCP Europe, Kaplan started his career as marketing professor at the [[ESSEC Business School]] and [[Sciences Po Paris]].

Particularly interested in the future of [[management]] education in [[Europe]] and the general [[business school]] landscape, Kaplan has furthermore written articles treating [[European management]] as well as higher education and their future evolution notably with the digitization of the sector due to the arrival of MOOCs and SPOCs. Defining Europe as holding “maximum cultural diversity at minimal geographical distances“, Kaplan is a strong advocate of [[cross-cultural]] management education.&lt;ref&gt;Andreas Kaplan: ''European management and European business schools: Insights from the history of business schools.'' In: ''European Management Journal.'' 32, 2014, S.&amp;nbsp;529, {{DOI|10.1016/j.emj.2014.03.006}}.&lt;/ref&gt; He furthermore is in favor of an [[European Union|EU]] [[European Commissioner|commissioner]] for happiness.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://theconversation.com/how-can-the-european-union-be-more-meaningful-for-its-citizens-85120 |title=How can the European Union be more meaningful for its citizens?}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Research==
Kaplan started doing research in the areas of [[mass customization]], [[innovation]], [[customer lifetime valuation]], and [[relationship marketing]]. Since then his research mainly deals with analyzing and decrypting the digital sphere. With more than 18 000 citations on Google Scholar, Professor Kaplan was counted amongst the Top 50 Business and Management authors in the world according to [[John Wiley &amp; Sons]]. Kaplan received the annual Best Article Award from ''Business Horizons'', sponsored by [[Elsevier]], for his 2012 paper "If you love something, let it go mobile: Mobile marketing and mobile social media 4x4".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.escpeurope.eu/nc/media-news/news-newsletter/news-single/back/232/article/mobile-social-media-professor-andreas-kaplan-receives-best-article-award-2012-from-business-horizon/|title=Mobile Social Media: Professor Andreas Kaplan receives Best Article Award 2012 from Business Horizons|publisher=ESCP Europe|work=Press release|date=February 12, 2013|access-date=2013-02-14|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171018170547/http://www.escpeurope.eu/nc/media-news/news-newsletter/news-single/back/232/article/mobile-social-media-professor-andreas-kaplan-receives-best-article-award-2012-from-business-horizon/|archive-date=2017-10-18|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In particular, his 2010 article co-authored with [[Michael Haenlein]] "Users of the world, unite! The challenges and opportunities of social media" published in ''Business Horizons'' is widely cited (over 13,000 times on Google Scholar, over 4,000 times in Scopus, and over 400 times in Business Source Premier) and known in the field. This seminal article "Users of the World, Unite!" recurrently achieved first place in Science Direct's annual list of the 25 most downloaded publications across all 24 core subject areas covered in Science Direct, ranging from [[Management]] to [[Engineering]], [[Psychology]], or [[Neuroscience]] and thus was downloaded more often than any other of the approximately 13.4 million papers in the collection.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.escpeurope.eu/nc/media-news/news-newsletter/news-single/article/users-of-the-world-unite-most-downloaded-paper-of-approximately-134-million-articles/|title="Users of the world, unite!" most downloaded paper of approximately 13.4 million articles - Top 50 Business &amp; Management Authors in the World Kaplan and Haenlein again Ranked First in Science Direct Hottest Article List|publisher=ESCP Europe|work=Press release|date=June 19, 2014|access-date=2016-08-03|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171018170552/http://www.escpeurope.eu/nc/media-news/news-newsletter/news-single/article/users-of-the-world-unite-most-downloaded-paper-of-approximately-134-million-articles/|archive-date=2017-10-18|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

More recent research deals with the influence of the digital sphere on higher education such as the arrival of [[MOOC]]s and SPOCs. His activities as speaker, commentator, and consultant consequently evolve around these topics.

[[File:Plate CXLVIII from 1st Encyclopaedia Britannica.jpg|thumb|right|Bell's [[intaglio printing|copperplate]] of a first rate [[ship-of-the-line|ship-of-war]] from the First Edition of the ''[[Encyclopædia Britannica]]'' - "undoubtedly the noblest machine that ever was invented"]]
'''Andrew Bell''' (1726–1809) was a [[Scotland|Scottish]] [[engraver]] and [[Printer (publisher)|printer]], who co-founded ''[[Encyclopædia Britannica]]'' with [[Colin Macfarquhar]].

Bell was born in [[Edinburgh]] in 1726, his father a baker. He had little formal education and was apprenticed to the engraver Richard Cooper.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Kafker|first=Frank A.|date=1 October 2008|title=THE ACHIEVEMENT OF ANDREW BELL and COLIN MACFARQUHAR AS THE FIRST PUBLISHERS OF THE ENCYCLOPAEDIA BRITANNICA|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1754-0208.1995.tb00185.x/full|journal=[[Journal for Eighteenth-Century Studies]]|volume=18|issue=2|pages=139–152|doi=10.1111/j.1754-0208.1995.tb00185.x|accessdate=2 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bell was a colourful Scot.  His height was 4 foot 6; he had crooked legs and an enormous nose that he would sometimes augment with a paper-mache version whenever anyone stared at his natural nose.&lt;ref name="kogan_1958" &gt;{{cite book | last = Kogan | first = Herman | authorlink =Herman Kogan| year = 1958 | title = The Great EB: The Story of the Encyclopædia Britannica | publisher = The University of Chicago Press | location = Chicago | lccn= 58-8379}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bell began work as an engraver of crests, names, etc. on dog collars.&lt;ref name="kogan_1958" /&gt;  Despite his small stature, he deliberately rode the tallest horse available in [[Edinburgh]], dismounting by a ladder to the cheers of onlookers.&lt;ref name="kogan_1958" /&gt;

He married Anne Wake who was the daughter of an excise officer in 1756.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kafker|first=Frank A.|date=2008-10-01|title=THE ACHIEVEMENT OF ANDREW BELL and COLIN MACFARQUHAR AS THE FIRST PUBLISHERS OF THE ENCYCLOPAEDIA BRITANNICA|url=https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/j.1754-0208.1995.tb00185.x|journal=Journal for Eighteenth-Century Studies|language=en|volume=18|issue=2|pages=139–152|doi=10.1111/j.1754-0208.1995.tb00185.x|issn=1754-0194}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bell produced almost all of the copperplate engravings for the 1st-4th editions of the ''Britannica'': 160 for the 1st, 340 for the 2nd, 542 for the 3rd, and 531 for the 4th.  By contrast, the 50 plates of the Supplement to the 3rd edition were engraved by D. Lizars.  For the 1st edition, Bell produced three full pages of anatomically accurate depictions of dissected female pelvises and of foetuses in wombs for the [[midwife]]ry article; these illustrations shocked King [[George III of the United Kingdom|George III]] who commanded that the pages be ripped from every copy.{{citation needed|date= June 2018}}

After Macfarquhar died in 1793, Bell bought out his heirs and became sole owner of the ''Britannica'' until his own death in 1809.  He quarrelled with his son-in-law, [[Thomas Bonar]], and refused to speak with him for the last ten years of his life.{{citation needed|date= June 2018}}

This focused especially on Hariri's own association with Saudi Oger at the time of its failure to pay its migrant workers in November 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.arabnews.com/node/936796/saudi-arabia|title=Saudi Oger Ltd.Angry workers burned vehicles|accessdate=28 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Bas Lansdorp''' (born 5 March 1977) is a Dutch [[entrepreneur]] best known as the co-founder and CEO of [[Mars One]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-18506033|title=Can the Dutch do reality TV in space?|date=June 20, 2012 | work=BBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.japantimes.co.jp/news/2013/04/24/world/reality-show-seeks-one-way-travelers-for-mars-mission/#.UXz3daLFWSo|title=Reality show seeks one-way travelers for Mars mission|date=April 24, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Education==
Lansdorp received his [[Master of Science]] in [[Mechanical Engineering]] from the [[University of Twente]] in 2003.&lt;ref name="m"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mars-one.com/en/about-mars-one/team|title=Mars One Team|year=2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
He worked for five years on his PhD in wind energy at [[Delft University of Technology]].&lt;ref name="m" /&gt; In 2008 he dropped his studies to found [[Ampyx Power]] in order to develop a more up to date method of generating [[wind energy]]. Ampyx Power was a success and it produced a cheaper than coal method of producing wind energy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.jeserie.org/about/lecturers/bas-lansdorp-ms|title=Bas  Lansdorp M.S. - Jefferson Educational Society|last=LLC.|first=Website powered by epicPlatform from Epic Web Studios,|website=www.jeserie.org|access-date=2017-03-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2011, he sold his Ampyx Power shares so he could fund [[Mars One]].&lt;ref name="n"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/03/09/business/global/reality-tv-for-the-red-planet.html?pagewanted=all&amp;_r=1&amp;|title=Reality TV for the Red Planet|newspaper=The New York Times|date=March 8, 2013|first=Nicola|last=Clark}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mars One==

Lansdorp became determined to establish the [[Colonization of Mars|first permanent human colony]] on [[Mars]] during his studies at the [[University of Twente]]. His primary focus was not on overcoming the technological challenges, rather the [[business model]].&lt;ref name="n"/&gt;

Until 2013, he allegedly financed almost the entire project himself.&lt;ref name="n"/&gt; There are two entities to the Mars One, [[Mars One]] Foundation and Mars One Ventures. Mars One is non-profit and funded by donations. Mars One implements and manages the mission, trains astronauts, owns the hardware, etc. Mars One Ventures is a for-profit entity of Mars One and holds exclusive monetization rights around the mission. Revenue from the monetization is expected to increase as the venture progresses.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.mars-one.com/faq/finance-and-feasibility/what-is-mars-ones-funding-model|title=Mars One Funding Model - Finance and Feasibility - Mars One|website=Mars One|access-date=2017-03-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 28 December 2013, Lansdorp did an "Ask Me Anything" on [[Reddit]] and had to face much [[criticism]] and [[skepticism]] about [[Mars One]].&lt;ref&gt;https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1tw2fy/i_am_bas_lansdorp_cofounder_of_marsone_mankinds/&lt;/ref&gt; He responded to the criticism positively, he said “Since we started Mars One in March 2011, we received support from scientists, engineers, businessmen and –women and aeropace companies from all over the world. The announcement of our plan in May 2012 resulted in the engagement of the general public, and the support from sponsors and investors. To see our mission evolve this way feels like my dream is becoming a reality.".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.theverge.com/2015/8/18/9166697/mars-one-plan-mit-debate-ceo-bas-lansdorp|title=Mars One debates MIT: CEO Bas Lansdorp still doesn’t have a plan to reach the planet|date=2015-08-18|website=The Verge|access-date=2017-03-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Ampyx Power ==
In 2008, Lansdorp founded [[Ampyx Power]] with Richard Ruiterkamp in order to create a more modern and efficient way to harvest wind energy. He was involved in the design process of new aircraft and project overview from 2008 to 2011. In 2011, he sold his shares in the company in order to found Mars One.

In 1984, she received BSc (Hons) Degree in Sociology from the National American University, then in 1986, went on to achieve MSc Degree in Social Economics and Political Science.

==Personal life==
Princess Basmah was married to a member of the Al Sharif family in 1988.&lt;ref name=bio/&gt; They divorced in 2007.&lt;ref name=bio/&gt; She is a mother of five children.&lt;ref name="independent"&gt;{{cite news|last=Milmo|first=Cahal|title=The Acton princess calling for reform in Saudi Arabia|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/people/news/the-acton-princess-calling-for-reform-in-saudi-arabia-6284225.html|accessdate=5 April 2012|newspaper=The Independent|date=3 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her children, three daughters and two sons, are Saud, Sara, Samahir, Sohood and Ahmad.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=King Saud's Sons and Daughters|url=http://www.kingsaud.net/at/txt.php?a=1106|publisher=King Saud.net|accessdate=23 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Blackmailed===
Princess Basmah said that a gang blackmailed her to transfer £320,000 to a bank account in Egypt. The threat was a to publish visual materials showing her smoking and blowing a kiss in front of a PC camera without a [[veil]] on her head. Basmah said that the material was stolen from her personal PC. However, she published the recording of a conversation between her and the blackmailer on her YouTube official website.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Saudi princess blackmailed by a fake sheikh who wants £320,000 for video which shows her smoking and blowing a kiss with head uncovered|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2279960/Princess-Basmah-Fake-Sheikh-wants-money-video-shows-smoking-head-uncovered.html|work=Daily Mail|accessdate=28 April 2013|date=17 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; She said in Saudi Arabia it is inappropriate that women appear without a hijab or smoking in public.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Saudi princess, the fake sheikh and a plot to silence her|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/middleeast/saudiarabia/9875114/The-Saudi-princess-the-fake-sheikh-and-a-plot-to-silence-her.html|work=The Telegraph|accessdate=28 April 2013|date=17 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Business==
After Basmah bint Saud divorced her Saudi husband, she founded a chain of restaurants in [[Saudi Arabia]] and she is planning to expand these into Britain.&lt;ref name="independent"/&gt; In 2008, she also founded a media firm, Media Ecco, in addition to catering firms, which she is also planning to expand.&lt;ref name=bio/&gt;

===Views===
Basmah bint Saud is a mild advocate of reform. She has been an active participant of different social institutions and human rights organizations. She began to express her views on Arab and international media, writing articles on the hard life conditions of Saudis, particularly of women.&lt;ref name=memriapr12&gt;{{cite web|last=Admon|first=Y.|title=First Signs of Protest by Sunnis in Saudi Arabia|url=http://www.memri.org/report/en/0/0/0/0/189/0/6245.htm|publisher=MEMRI|accessdate=27 May 2012|format=Inquiry and Analysis Series Report No.819|date=4 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, her criticisms do not directly address the royal family but the Saudi governors and other middle-level administrators.&lt;ref name=independent/&gt;&lt;ref name=memriapr12/&gt; Writing for ''[[Al Madina (newspaper)|Al Madina]]'' newspaper in April 2010, Basmah bint Saud told that she could not find any Qur'anic or Islamic historical basis for a state institution to promote virtue and prevent vice, and she further argued that the arrests and beatings by religious policemen lead to an incorrect impression about [[Islam]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Saudi Arabia. Looser Rein, Uncertain Gain|url=http://dspace.cigilibrary.org/jspui/bitstream/123456789/29761/1/Looser%20Rein,%20Uncertain%20Gain.pdf?1|publisher=Human Rights Watch|accessdate=20 April 2012|year=2010|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130921060516/http://dspace.cigilibrary.org/jspui/bitstream/123456789/29761/1/Looser%20Rein%2C%20Uncertain%20Gain.pdf?1|archive-date=21 September 2013|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; She specifically supports reform in Saudi Islamic laws regarding bans on mixed gatherings of men and women, and to make optional for Muslim women to cover modestly or not.&lt;ref name=independent/&gt;

Her journalism and blogging has drawn criticism, and she told ''The Independent'' that Saudi officials had begun censoring her articles.&lt;ref name=independent/&gt; On the other hand, she insisted that her move from [[Jeddah]] to Acton was not due to pressure from the Saudi state.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Princess Basma bint Saud bin Abdulaziz leads campaign of Saudi dissent|url=http://www.actonw3.com/default.asp?section=info&amp;page=consaudi001.htm|accessdate=6 April 2012|newspaper=Acton w3|date=3 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Basmah bint Saud has questioned the misuse of the Islamic [[fiqh]] in Saudi society, arguing that the religious establishment needs to be reformed in order that it plays a constructive role in modernising society and improving the situation of women in the kingdom.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Princess Basma bint Saud Fredom|url=http://www.memri.org/report/en/0/0/0/0/0/0/5443.htm|accessdate=6 April 2012|newspaper=Memri|date=7 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 2012, Basmah told [[BBC]] that there are many changes she would like to see in [[Saudi Arabia]] but that is not the time for women to be allowed to drive,&lt;ref name=change&gt;{{cite news|title=Saudi princess: What I'd change about my country|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-17446831|accessdate=18 April 2012|newspaper=BBC|date=8 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; a right Saudi women were given as part of the reforms by [[Salman of Saudi Arabia|King Salman]] and Crown Prince [[Mohammad bin Salman]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Saudi Women Can Drive, but Here’s the Real Roadblock|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2018/06/22/world/middleeast/saudi-arabia-women-driving.html|accessdate=22 June 2018|newspaper=New York Times|date=22 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Basmah called for changes concerning constitution, divorce laws, overhaul of the educational system, complete reform of social services and changes in the role of the mahram (the male guardian, usually a relative, that all Saudi women are required to have).&lt;ref name=change/&gt; Upon the paralysing of a Saudi national as a punishment by the Kingdom, Princess Basmah criticised it, stating that it cannot be acceptable on humanitarian grounds.&lt;ref name=bbc5april&gt;{{cite news|title=Princess condemns Saudi Arabia paralysis sentence|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-middle-east-22041636|accessdate=5 April 2013|newspaper=BBC|date=5 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The Fourth Way Law==
Through the research centre, GURA, based in London, the Fourth Way Law was registered and documented by the European Union in 2014. Princess Basmah received a prize in recognition for internationally monitoring human rights, geopolitical changes, international developments, establishing training centres in various fields related to the culture of the Fourth Way Law on a global scale, such as security, economic and administrative. It has been noted that many countries, such as America and Britain, have been taking recommendations from the Fourth Way Law when making decisions on intellectual, environmental and economic security which other specialist international research centres had not discussed.

One of these recommendations was the decision of the American President Obama in 2014 to implement a law to monitor social network sites and develop specialised laws for it. This idea was raised when Princess Basmah suggested it at the research centre at the University of Yale in New York in 2011. Heads of the boards of directors from Google, Yahoo and Microsoft had attended her lecture.

Many sections from the Fourth Way Law&lt;ref&gt;http://thefourthwaylaw.com&lt;/ref&gt; specialising in human rights have also been adopted in Britain after she gave a famous lecture at the University of Cambridge in 2012.&lt;ref&gt;https://cus.org/media/1987&lt;/ref&gt; In July 2015, the British government took up all the recommendations offered by Princess Basmah in the Fourth Way Law during her residence in Britain (2011–2014).&lt;ref&gt;http://www.alriyadh.com/1143979&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Chemonics International''' is a private [[international development]] company that works for bilateral and multilateral donors and the private sector to manage projects in developing countries. The organization bids primarily on contracts from the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) and manages projects that cover a variety of technical sectors. These sectors include agriculture and food security, corporate partnerships, democracy and governance, economic growth, education and youth, environment and natural resources, gender equality, social inclusion, health, peace and stability, supply chain solutions, and water.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://seepnetwork.org/Member-Details/chemonics-international|title=Member Details|website=seepnetwork.org|language=en|access-date=2018-05-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to its headquarters in Washington, D.C., the company also has project offices in different countries, covering Asia, Africa, Eurasia, Europe, Latin America, and the Middle East.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.devex.com/organizations/chemonics-international-inc-1492|title=Chemonics International Inc. {{!}} Devex|website=www.devex.com|access-date=2018-05-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
Chemonics was founded in 1975 by Thurston F. (Tony) Teele.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A20168-2005Apr1.html |title=Obituaries |publisher=washingtonpost.com |date=2005-04-02 |accessdate=2014-01-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Criticism ==
Chemonics has been subject to criticism from the [[US Agency for International Development]] (USAID) [[Office of Inspector General, U.S. Agency for International Development|Office of Inspector General]] (OIG) for their work on several multimillion-dollar aid contracts.

In 2012 Chemonics came under scrutiny by the OIG for their work in Haiti after the [[2010 Haiti earthquake|2010 earthquake]]. Chemonics was the largest single recipient of post-earthquake funds from USAID, receiving over $196 million in contracts&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.cepr.net/documents/publications/haiti-aid-accountability-2013-04.pdf|title = Breaking Open the Black Box|date = April 2013|accessdate = 2015-04-25|website = |publisher = Center for Economic and Policy Research|last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt; many of which were "no-bid."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url = http://www.cleveland.com/world/index.ssf/2010/12/outsourcing_quake_assistance_h.html|title = Outsourcing quake assistance: Haitian contractors get only 1.6% of U.S. aid|last = Mendoza|first = Martha|date = 2010-12-12|work = |access-date = 2015-04-25|via = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Audits specifically cited Chemonics lack of a comprehensive monitoring and evaluation plan and that "some of the performance indicators Chemonics developed were not well-defined."&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url = https://oig.usaid.gov/sites/default/files/audit-reports/1-521-12-009-p.pdf|title = Audit of USAID's Haiti Recovery Initiative Activities Managed By Office of Transition Initiatives|date = 2012-09-26|accessdate = 2015-04-25|website = |publisher = US Agency for International Development Office of Inspector General|last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Chemonics also spent more than 75 percent of program budgets on material and equipment when an expenditure of only 30 percent was planned.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url = https://oig.usaid.gov/sites/default/files/audit-reports/1-521-10-009-p.pdf|title = Audit of USAID's Cash-for-Work Activities in Haiti|date = 2010-09-24|accessdate = 2015-04-25|website = |publisher = US Agency for International Development Office of Inspector General|last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

An Inspector General's report also found that local communities were not sufficiently involved with Chemonics' work and stated "Chemonics used contractors from [[Port-au-Prince]] to implement a number of activities in [[Cap-Haitien]] and [[Saint-Marc]]; these contractors brought their own people to do the jobs instead of hiring locals."&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; When locals were required by USAID, Chemonics' policies "limited the transparency of the selection process and increase the risk of corruption or favoritism by granting decision-making authority to a few individuals."&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

In November 2006, USAID Afghanistan awarded a $62 million contract to Chemonics, with an expected end date of March 2010. A 2008 audit of the contract by OIG found that Chemonics' "results fell considerably short of intended results" and "buildings constructed by Chemonics’ subcontractors were not acceptable because of significant construction defects."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = https://oig.usaid.gov/sites/default/files/audit-reports/5-306-08-009-p.pdf|title = Audit of USAID/Afghanistan's Accelerating Sustainable Agriculture Program|date = 2008-08-08|accessdate = 2015-04-25|website = |publisher = US Agency for International Development Office of Inspector General|last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2016, A Department of Labor investigation into Chemonics’ hiring practices found that the group discriminated against applicants based on race while trying to fill entry-level positions. According to the Guardian, none of the 124 Black Americans who applied for the jobs in Chemonics International’s regional business units were hired. Chemonics agreed to pay $482,243 to job applicants who were subjected to racial discrimination in the company’s hiring process, the Guardian reported.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.theguardian.com/global-development-professionals-network/2016/nov/21/top-us-government-aid-partner-to-pay-500k-damages-to-african-american-job-applicants?CMP=twt_gu&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3690">'''Digital nervous system''' is a phrase, popularly associated with [[Bill Gates]] of [[Microsoft]], used to describe a vision for how the [[IT infrastructure]] of an enterprise could be analogous to the [[autonomic nervous system]] of a biological organism. Gates made extensive use of the term in his 1999 book ''[[Business @ the Speed of Thought]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Gates, Bill (1999). ''Business @ The Speed of Thought'', Warner Books, New York. {{ISBN|0-446-67596-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The actual phrase ''digital nervous system'' may not have originated with Gates however, as it has been reported that Judith Dayhoff used the term before Gates did.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.theregister.co.uk/1999/04/12/digital_nervous_system_not_bill/&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Steve Ballmer]] attempted to explain the digital nervous system by saying the following:

:If you think of the human body, what does our nervous system let us do? It lets us hear, see, take input.  It lets us think and analyze and plan. It lets us make decisions and communicate and take action. Every company essentially has a nervous system: companies take inputs, they think, they plan, they communicate, they take action. The question is how does the nervous system in your company operate? Is the IT infrastructure really adding value?&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.microsoft.com/presspass/exec/steve/sweden.mspx Steve Ballmer Speech Transcript - Digital Nervous System Seminar&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;
 
Gates himself offered the following explanation as part of a keynote speech at Microsoft's ''Second Annual CEO Summit'' in 1998.

:The term 'digital nervous system' is kind of an interesting one. The analogy, of course, is to the biological nervous system where you always have the information you need. You always are alert to the most important things, and you block out the information that's not important. And companies really need to have that same kind of thing: the information that's valuable getting to the people who need to know about it.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.roughnotes.com/rnmagazine/1998/october98/10p34.htm Digital Nervous System 10/98&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

''Digital nervous system'' has also been described as being synonymous with the term 'Zero Latency Enterprise', another phrase representing the way an enterprise uses IT systems to rapidly communicate between customers, employees and trading partners.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://soa.sys-con.com/node/39849|title=Moving Toward the Zero Latency Enterprise|accessdate=2009-05-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
The term ''digital nervous systems'' was used in 1987–89 at the ''IBM Guide/Share Conference'' in a presentation originally titled "The Body Enterprise" later retitled "The Cybernetic Factory -- the next generation in CIM".

While in Queensland, Mayo served on the University's war committee and pioneered research into the psychoanalytic treatment of shell-shock. As a psychologist Mayo often helped soldiers returning from World War I recover from the stresses of war and with a Brisbane physician, pioneered the [[psychoanalytic]] treatment of [[shell-shock]] and conducted psycho-pathological tests.&lt;ref name = "Cullen"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.library.hbs.edu/hc/hawthorne/04.html|title=Enter Elton Mayo|work=hbs.edu|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150512230424/http://www.library.hbs.edu/hc/hawthorne/04.html|archivedate=12 May 2015|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was a lecturer in psychology and mental philosophy at the UQ between 1911 and 1922, when he sailed to the United States.&lt;ref name = "Cullen"/&gt; In 1926 he was appointed to the [[Harvard Business School]] (HBS) as a professor of industrial research.&lt;ref name = "Cullen"/&gt;

In Philadelphia he conducted research at a textile plant in order to develop a method to reduce the very high rate of turnover in the plant.&lt;ref&gt;Mayo, E. (1924). Revery and industrial fatigue. ''Journal of Personnel Research, 3'', 273-281.&lt;/ref&gt;  Mayo's association with the [[Hawthorne studies]] as well as his research and work in Australia led to his enjoying a public acclaim granted to few social scientists of his day.

Mayo has been credited with making significant contributions to a number of disciplines, including [[business management]], [[industrial sociology]], philosophy, and [[social psychology]]. His field research in industry had a significant impact on [[industrial and organizational psychology]].&lt;ref name = "Trahair"&gt;Trahair, R. C. S. (1984). ''Elton Mayo: The humanist temper''. Piscataway, NJ: Transaction&lt;/ref&gt; According to Trahair, Mayo "is known for having established the scientific study of what today is called [[organizational behavior]] when he gave close attention to the human, social, and political problems of industrial civilization." (p.&amp;nbsp;15).&lt;ref name="Trahair"/&gt;

Mayo's work helped to lay the foundation for the [[human relations movement]].&lt;ref name = "Cullen"/&gt; He emphasized that alongside the formal organization of an industrial workplace there exists an informal organizational structure as well.&lt;ref name = "Cullen"/&gt; Mayo recognized the "inadequacies of existing [[scientific management]] approaches" to industrial organizations, and underlined the importance of relationships among people who work for such organizations.&lt;ref name = "Miner"/&gt; His ideas on group relations were advanced in his 1933 book ''The Human Problems of an Industrialized Civilization'', which was based partly on his Hawthorne research.&lt;ref&gt;Mayo, E. (1933). ''The human problems of an industrial civilization''. Cambridge, MA: Harvard.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life and education==
Mayo was the eldest son of George Gibbes Mayo, a draftsman and later a civil engineer, and his wife Henrietta Mary, née Donaldson. His grandfather [[George Mayo]] (1807–1894) was a well-known South Australian medical practitioner. Elton attended several schools in Australia (Queen's School, [[St Peter's College, Adelaide]], and [[University of Adelaide]]) and after 1901 attended medical school in Edinburgh and London, neither of which he completed. In 1903 he went to West Africa, and upon returning to London, began writing articles for magazines and teaching English at the Working Men's College. He returned to Adelaide in 1905 to a partnership in the printing firm of J. H. Sherring &amp; Co., but in 1907 he went back to the university to study philosophy and [[psychology]] under Sir William Mitchell. He won the Roby Fletcher prize in psychology and graduated with honours (B.A., 1910; M.A., 1926&lt;ref&gt;Trahair, R. C. S. (1984). ''Elton Mayo: The humanist temper''. Piscataway, NJ: Transaction. "Mayo wrote of his appointment [to Harvard] to Sir William Mitchell, his mentor at the University of Adelaide. Immediately Mitchell personally arranged for Mayo to receive a Master of Arts degree. It was awarded for a thesis, presumably, on Mayo's research at Continental Mills" (p. 199), a textile manufacturing plant in Philadelphia.&lt;/ref&gt;) and was named the David Murray research scholar in [[scientific]] studies. In 1911 he became foundation lecturer in mental and moral philosophy at the new [[University of Queensland]] and in 1919–23 held the first chair of philosophy there.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://espace.library.uq.edu.au/data/UQ_151381/flop_7.pdf?Expires=1486103769&amp;Signature=F8xJdtwWaoH35TZP7UMLMdTSwVHOqi7mBYEjyytN~1kACuIHb1xQB-W5qayskhte-WzXD7FLr9bYUbb77HNKazlLGBBTadyu~QUwy5h0cDTbl5KMAxRTzrlnki9EcM1AYVuHJYXYnlS9W6XzeMu0T34jjWrYr9pxoFlNQEBK7BqXko5nULC70993QnBOU7y6EmV9VWWlriIUIz3TRHsNymAcbDYm~DCrN4huTGQj3O-V8SQ~CWBxVCOsiG2CyiawZm~PbWlxXqjYzuOl7kx0Mz4aHIs7gbLIIXFlyRNBHMeSGayzBkNVm5TBsoYhBl9KQiSYfdZSS~SMiWx6zCXs4g__&amp;Key-Pair-Id=APKAJKNBJ4MJBJNC6NLQ|title=Vivant Professores: distinguished members of the University of Queensland, 1910-1940|last=Gregory|first=Helen|publisher=University of Queensland|year=1987|isbn=0 908471 09 2|location=|pages=94|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; He moved on to the [[University of Pennsylvania]], but spent the second half of his career at [[Harvard Business School]] (1926–1947), where he was professor of industrial research.

Two influences on his career from his time at the University of Queensland were Mayo's friendship with the social anthropologist [[Bronislaw Malinowski]] and his work with shell-shock cases returning from the First World War. Malinowski first met Mayo on his way to and from the Trobriand Islands; they became close friends and were regularly in touch until Malinowski's death in 1942. The work with shell-shock soldiers provided a focus for Mayo's interests in [[clinical psychology]] and developed his skills in [[psychotherapy]]. In this he was strongly influenced by the work on [[hysteria]] and obsession of the French [[psychiatrist]], [[Pierre Janet]], who became a critic of [[Sigmund Freud]]. For the rest of his working life, Mayo was an active [[psychotherapist]] and this practical experience was an important influence on his theoretical and methodological work in America.{{citation needed|date=October 2014}}

==Research==
One of Mayo's (1924) earliest research efforts involved workers at a Philadelphia textile mill.&lt;ref&gt;Mayo, E. (1924). Recovery and industrial fatigue. ''The Journal of Personnel Research, 3'', 273-281.&lt;/ref&gt; The mill had been experiencing a high rate of [[turnover (employment)|turnover]]. Mayo believed that the repetitive work in the [[spinning (textiles)|spinning]] department gave rise to mental abnormalities in the workers. He found that the introduction of rest periods helped reduce turnover. The research helped make Mayo more widely known in the U.S.&lt;ref name = "Cullen"/&gt;

Mayo helped to lay the foundation for the [[human relations movement]], and was known for his industrial research including the [[Hawthorne Studies]] and his book ''The Human Problems of an Industrialized Civilization'' (1933).&lt;ref name="adb.anu.edu.au"&gt;{{cite web |last=Bourke |first=Helen |url=http://adb.anu.edu.au/biography/mayo-george-elton-7541 |title="Mayo, George Elton (1880–1949)" by Helen Bourke |publisher=Adb.anu.edu.au |date= |accessdate=20 February 2014 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131024072415/http://adb.anu.edu.au/biography/mayo-george-elton-7541 |archivedate=24 October 2013 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; The research he conducted under the rubric of the Hawthorne Studies in the late 1920s and early 1930s, underlining the importance of groups in affecting the behaviour of individuals at work.

Elton Mayo laid the ''ground rules for interviewing'', the principles of which have been subsequently repeated in numerous 'how to' books on leadership, coaching and mentoring over the last half century.{{fact|date=January 2018}}

===Hawthorne studies===
[[Fritz J. Roethlisberger]], Mayo's graduate assistant, and William J. Dickson, head of the Department of Employee Relations at Western Electric, conducted the bulk of the practical research, with Mayo rarely visiting the Hawthorne plant in Cicero, Illinois.&lt;ref name = "Cullen"/&gt; Mayo's team carried out a number of "experiments" to look at ways of improving [[productivity]]. The research involved manipulating length of rest and lunch periods and piecework payment plans.&lt;ref name="Parsons"&gt;Parsons, H.M. (1974). What happened at Hawthorne? ''Science, 183''(4128), 922-932. doi: 10.1126/science.183.4128.922&lt;/ref&gt; Mayo concluded that productivity partly depended on the informal social patterns of interaction in the work group.

Mayo, in communicating to business leaders, advanced the idea that managers who understand the nature of informal ties among workers can make decisions for management's benefit.&lt;ref name = "Cullen"/&gt; Mayo concluded that people's work performance is dependent on both social relationships and job content. He suggested a tension between workers' "logic of sentiment" and managers' "logic of cost and efficiency" which could lead to conflict within organizations.

Parsons, however, showed that the Hawthorne studies, which were not really experiments, were too confounded to enable researchers to draw firm conclusions.&lt;ref name = "Parsons"/&gt; The qualitative aspects of the research suggested that norms of co-operation among workers were related to productivity.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://mbalearner.com/hawthorne-effect/|title=Hawthorne Effect {{!}} What is Hawthorne Effect? - MBA Learner|date=2018-02-22|work=MBA Learner|access-date=2018-02-25|language=en-US|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180226040637/https://mbalearner.com/hawthorne-effect/|archivedate=26 February 2018|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mayo's credentials==
Although biographers agree about Mayo's contributions, there is no consensus about his credentials. The ''[[Encyclopædia Britannica]]'', [[biographical]] dictionaries,&lt;ref name="anu.edu.au"/&gt; and some published texts indicate that Mayo was a psychologist.&lt;ref name="britannica.com"/&gt; Some authors and critics have discussed Mayo's credentials and his various other job titles during his career in the United States. Cullen does not mention that Mayo was a psychologist although Cullen noted that Mayo let interlocutors call him "Dr. Mayo," letting himself be cast as a Ph.D. in one of the social sciences, without correcting the mistake.&lt;ref name = "Cullen"/&gt; Mayo's biographer Trahair wrote, "Mayo was not a psychologist, sociologist, or anthropologist, although sometimes he was cast as such" (p.&amp;nbsp;357).&lt;ref name = "Trahair"/&gt; Trahair also wrote that "after the great war Mayo's reputation grew as a successful academic, clinical psychologist and public speaker" (p.&amp;nbsp;89). Of course having a reputation as a clinical psychologist does not necessarily make one a clinical psychologist (the public often thinks of psychotherapists, regardless of training, as clinical psychologists or even psychiatrists).&lt;ref&gt;Von Sydow, K., &amp; Reimer, C. (1998). Attitudes toward psychotherapists, psychologists, psychiatrists and psychoanalysts: A meta-content analysis of 60 studies published between 1948 and 1995. ''American Journal of Psychotherapy, 52''(4), 463-488.&lt;/ref&gt;

Cullen&lt;ref name = "Cullen"/&gt; indicated that Mayo was not a medical doctor, writing that in April 1903, Mayo "enrolled at a small medical school at Saint George's Hospital at London....At this point, Mayo's interest in medicine was all but non-existent" (p.&amp;nbsp;28). Having dropped out by December 1903, Mayo "wrote home and finally revealed to his family the truth; he did not and could not become a doctor" (p.&amp;nbsp;28). Miner&lt;ref name = "Miner"/&gt; wrote: "An effective speaker and proficient in cultivating influential friends and mentors, he nevertheless had little by way of academic credentials and practically no training in the conduct of scientific research" (p.&amp;nbsp;60).

==Criticisms==
Mayo's contributions to management theory were criticised by intellectual [[Daniel Bell]]. Writing in 1947, Bell criticised Mayo and other social scientists for "adjusting men to machines," rather than enlarging human capacity or human freedom.&lt;ref&gt;Bell, D. (January 1947). The study of man: Adjusting men to machines. ''Commentary, 3'', 79–88.&lt;/ref&gt; Many, including [[Reinhard Bendix]] and Lloyd H. Fisher, criticized Mayo for generalizing his results of the Hawthorne studies.  The two state that Mayo's research concerned small, isolated groups, and it was not clear that the conditions and supervision he achieved could have been replicated in large groups and factory settings.&lt;ref&gt;Hseuh, Y. (2002). The Hawthorne Experiments and the Introduction of Jean Piaget in American Industrial Psychology, 1929-1932. ''History of Psychology, 5''(2), 163-189.&lt;/ref&gt;  His theories are also based upon the assumption that humans, by nature, want to cooperate and form groups, and he never allows for the possibility of [[José Ortega y Gasset]]'s idea of "the stranger," built upon the proposition that humans, by nature, are suspicious of others.&lt;ref&gt;Sarachek, B. (1968). Elton Mayo's Social Psychology and Human Relations. ''The Academy of Management Journal, 11''(2), 189-197.&lt;/ref&gt; More recently, in 2003, James Hoopes criticised Mayo for "substituting therapy for democracy."&lt;ref&gt;Hoopes, James. (2003). ''False Prophets: The Gurus Who Created Modern Management And Why Their Ideas Are Bad For Business Today''. Cambridge, MA: Basic Books.&lt;/ref&gt; Re-analyses of the original Hawthorne data indicate that the quality of the research was poor.&lt;ref&gt;Levitt, S.D., &amp; List, J.A. (2011). Was there really a Hawthorne effect at the Hawthorne plant? An analysis of the original illumination experiments. ''American Economic Journal: Applied Economics, 3'', 224–238. doi:10.1257/app.3.1.224&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Parsons"/&gt;

==Family==
Elton Mayo married Dorothea McConnel ( – ) on 18 April 1913. Dorothea was the eldest daughter of James Henry McConnel (c. 1850 – 7 June 1914) of [[Cressbrook Station]], Queensland and the sister of [[Ursula McConnel]].
They had two daughters:
*Patricia Elton Mayo married Dunstan Curtis. She was a sociologist, author of ''The Making of a Criminal'' (1970) and ''Roots of Identity''
*Gael Elton Mayo, better known as Ruth Elton Mayo (1923–1992), British artist and novelist.

The medical doctor [[Helen Mayo]] (1878–1967) was a sister, and the Supreme Court judge Sir [[Herbert Mayo (judge)|Herbert Mayo]] (1885–1972) was a brother.

Mined fluorite is separated into two main grades, with about equal production of each. ''Acidspar'' is at least 97% CaF&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;; ''metspar'' is much lower purity, 60–85%. (A small amount of the intermediate, ''ceramic'', grade is also made.)&lt;ref name="SME mining 2006"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ModFcchem"/&gt; Metspar is used almost exclusively for iron smelting.

==Inorganic fluorides==

About 3&amp;nbsp;kg (6.5&amp;nbsp;lb) of metspar grade fluorite, added directly to the batch, are used for every metric ton of steel made. The fluoride ions from CaF&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; lower the melt's temperature and [[viscosity]] (make the liquid runnier). The calcium content has a tangential benefit in removing sulfur and phosphorus, but other additives such as [[Lime (material)|lime]] are still needed. Metspar is similarly used in cast iron production and for other iron-containing alloys.&lt;ref name="AcountF"/&gt;&lt;ref name="USGS"&gt;{{cite book|chapter=Fluorspar|author=Miller, M. Michael|publisher=U.S. Geological Survey|year=2003|pages=27.1–27.12|title=U.S. Geological Survey Minerals Yearbook|url=http://minerals.usgs.gov/minerals/pubs/commodity/fluorspar/fluormyb03.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Fluorite of the acidspar grade is used directly as an additive to ceramics and enamels, glass fibers and clouded glass, and cement, as well as in the outer coating of welding rods.&lt;ref name="AcountF"/&gt; Acidspar is primarily used for making hydrofluoric acid, which is a [[Reaction intermediate|chemical intermediate]] for most fluorine-containing compounds. Significant direct uses of HF include [[Pickling (metal)|pickling]] (cleaning) of steel, [[cracking (chemistry)|cracking of alkanes]] in the petrochemical industry, and etching of glass.&lt;ref name="AcountF"/&gt;

[[File:Cryolite extraction of aluminium (labeled-en).svg|thumb|250px|Aluminium smelting process: cryolite (a fluoride) is required to dissolve alumnium oxide.]]

One third of HF (one sixth of mined fluorine) is used to make synthetic cryolite ([[sodium hexafluoroaluminate]]) and [[aluminium fluoride|aluminium trifluoride]]. These compounds are used in the electrolysis of aluminium by the [[Hall–Héroult process]]. About 23&amp;nbsp;kg (51&amp;nbsp;lb) are required for every metric ton of aluminium. These compounds are also used as a flux for glass.&lt;ref name="AcountF"/&gt;

[[Fluorosilicate]]s are the next most significant inorganic fluorides formed from HF. The most common one, that of sodium, is used for water fluoridation, as an intermediate for synthetic cryolite and [[silicon tetrafluoride]], and for treatment of effluents in laundries.{{sfn|Aigueperse et al.|2005|p=33}}

[[MgF2|MgF&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]] and, to a lesser extent, other [[Alkaline earth metal|alkaline earth]] difluorides are specialty optical materials.{{sfn|Aigueperse et al.|2005|pp=25–26}} Magnesium difluoride is widely used as an [[antireflection coating]] for spectacles and optical equipment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Practical equipment, materials, and processes for optical thin films|author=Willey, Ronald R.|page=113|isbn=9780615143972|publisher=Willey Optical|year=2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; The compound is also a component in newly devised constructions ([[negative index metamaterials]]) which are the subject of "invisibility" research.

Other inorganic fluorides made in large quantities include [[cobalt difluoride]] (for organofluorine synthesis), [[nickel difluoride]] (electronics), [[lithium fluoride]] (a flux), [[sodium fluoride]] (water fluoridation), [[potassium fluoride]] (flux), and [[ammonium fluoride]] (various).&lt;ref name="AcountF"/&gt; Sodium and potassium [[bifluoride]]s are significant to the chemical industry.{{sfn|Aigueperse et al.|2005|pp=26–27}}

==Fluorocarbons==

Making organic fluorides is the main use for hydrofluoric acid, consuming over 40% of it (over 20% of all mined fluorite). Within organofluorides, refrigerant gases are still the dominant segment, consuming about 80% of HF. Even though chlorofluorocarbons are widely banned, the replacement refrigerants are often other fluorinated molecules. Fluoropolymers are less than one quarter the size of refrigerant gases in terms of fluorine usage, but are growing faster.&lt;ref name="GIA f-chem report description"/&gt;&lt;ref name="AcountF"/&gt; Fluorosurfactants are a small segment in mass but are significant economically because of very high prices.

===Gases===

{{See also|Refrigerant}}

Traditionally chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) were the predominant fluorinated organic chemical. CFCs are identified by a system of numbering that explains the amount of fluorine, chlorine, carbon and hydrogen in the molecules. The term Freon has been colloquially used for CFCs and similar halogenated molecules, though strictly speaking this is just a DuPont brand name, and many other producers exist. Brand neutral terminology is to use "R" as the prefix. Prominent CFCs included R-11 ([[trichlorofluoromethane]]), R-12 ([[dichlorodifluoromethane]]), and R-114 ([[1,2-dichlorotetrafluoroethane]]).&lt;ref name="AcountF"/&gt;

[[File:US Navy 030515-N-1512S-040 Machinist^rsquo,s Mate 3rd Class Daniel Griffin wipes down Halon 1301 bottles in the aft main machinery room aboard the amphibious assault ship USS Kearsarge (LHD 3).jpg|alt=A sailor in coveralls wipes down red gas bottles|A Halon fire suppression system in a ship's machinery room|thumb|250px]]

Production of CFCs grew strongly through the 1980s, primarily for refrigeration and air conditioning but also for propellants and solvents. Since the end use of these materials is banned in most countries, this industry has shrunk dramatically. By the early 21st century, production of CFCs was less than 10% of the mid-1980s peak, with remaining use primarily as an intermediate for other chemicals. The banning of CFCs initially depressed the overall demand for fluorite but 21st century production of the source mineral has recovered to 1980s levels.&lt;ref name="AcountF"/&gt;

Hydrochlorofluorocarbons (HCFCs) and hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs) now serve as replacements for CFC refrigerants; few were commercially manufactured before 1990. Currently more than 90% of fluorine used for organics goes into these two classes (in about equal amounts). Prominent HCFCs include R-22 ([[chlorodifluoromethane]]) and R-141b ([[1,1-Dichloro-1-fluoroethane|1,1-dichloro-1-fluoroethane]]). The main HFC is R-134a ([[1,1,1,2-Tetrafluoroethane|1,1,1,2-tetrafluoroethane]]).&lt;ref name="AcountF"/&gt;

A bromofluoroalkane, "Halon" ([[bromotrifluoromethane]]) is still widely used in ship and aircraft [[gaseous fire suppression]] systems. Because Halon production has been banned since 1994, systems are dependent on the pre-ban stores and on recycling.&lt;ref name="Fire suppresion substitutes"&gt;{{cite book|url=http://www.nap.edu/openbook.php?record_id=5744&amp;page=1|chapter=Executive summary|title=Fire suppression substitutes and alternatives to Halon for U.S. Navy applications|page=1|publisher=National Academies Press|year=1997|isbn=978-0-309-07492-6|author=Committee on Assessment of Fire Suppression Substitutes and Alternatives to Halon (Commission on Physical Sciences, Mathematics, and Applications, National Research Council)}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A new type of Fluorine refrigerant, that is scoped to replace the high Global Warming Potential HFC compounds, are [[Hydrofluoroolefin|Hydrofluoroolefins]] (HFO).

===Fluoropolymers===

{{Main|Fluoropolymer}}

Fluoropolymers are less than 0.1% of all polymers produced in terms of weight. Compared to other polymers, they are more expensive and their consumption is growing at a higher rate. As of about 2006–2007, estimates of the global fluoropolymer production varied from over 100,000 to 180,000&amp;nbsp;metric&amp;nbsp;tons per year. Yearly revenue estimates ranged from over $2.5 billion to over $3.5 billion.&lt;!--|The over $3.5 billion is based on NA at 40% of global and US at $1.4 billion within the Freedonia sources. --&gt;&lt;ref name="Freedonia FP market"&gt;{{cite web|title=Fluoropolymers to 2013 – Demand and sales forecasts, market share, market size, market leaders (Abstract for market report)|url=http://www.freedoniagroup.com/Fluoropolymers.html|publisher=Freedonia Group|accessdate=10 November 2012|year=2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="yearly FP production"&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Buznik | first1 = V. M. | title = Fluoropolymer Chemistry in Russia: Current Situation and Prospects | doi = 10.1134/S1070363209030335 | journal = Russian Journal of General Chemistry | volume = 79 | issue = 3 | pages = 520–526 | year = 2009 | pmid =  | pmc = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) is 60–80% of the world's fluoropolymer production on a weight basis.&lt;ref name="yearly FP production"/&gt; The term Teflon is sometimes used generically for the substance, but is a Chemours Company and Dupont brand name—other PTFE producers exist and Chemours sometimes uses the Teflon brand for other materials. PTFE gets its fluorine without the need for fluorine gas: [[chloroform]] (trichloromethane) is treated with HF to make chlorodifluoromethane (R-22, an HFC); this chemical when heated makes [[tetrafluoroethylene]] (abbreviated TFE), the monomer of PTFE.&lt;ref name="encyc of structure"/&gt;

The largest application for PTFE is in [[electrical insulation]]. It is an excellent [[dielectric]] and very chemically stable. It is also used extensively in the chemical process industry where corrosion resistance is needed: in coating pipes, in tubing, and [[gasket]]s. Another major use is [[Fabric structure|architectural fabric]] (PTFE-coated fiberglass cloth used for stadium roofs and such). The major consumer application is [[Non-stick surface|non-stick]] cookware.&lt;ref name="encyc of structure"&gt;{{cite book|last=Martin|first=John Wilson|title=Concise encyclopedia of the structure of materials|year=2007|publisher=Elsevier|isbn=978-0-08-045127-5|pages=187–194|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xv420pEC2qMC&amp;pg=PA189}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When stretched with a jerk, a PTFE film makes a fine-pored [[Artificial membrane|membrane]]: expanded PTFE ([[ePTFE]]). The term "[[Gore-Tex]]" is sometimes used generically for this material, but that is a specific brand name. [[W.L. Gore &amp; Associates]] is not the only producer of ePTFE and furthermore "Gore-Tex" often refers to more complicated multi-layer membranes or [[laminated fabric]]s. ePTFE is used in rainwear, [[Personal protective equipment|protective apparel]] and [[filtration|liquids and gas filters]]. PTFE can also be formed into [[PTFE fiber|fibers]] which are used in [[seal (mechanical)|pump packing seals]] and [[Dust collector|bag house filters]] for industries with corrosive exhausts.&lt;ref name="encyc of structure"/&gt;

Other fluoropolymers tend to have similar properties to PTFE—high chemical resistance and good dielectric properties—which leads to use in the chemical process industry and electrical insulation. They are easier to work with (to form into complex shapes), but are more expensive than PTFE and have lower thermal stability. [[Fluorinated ethylene propylene]] (FEP) is the second most produced fluoropolymer. Films from two different fluoropolymers serve as glass-replacements in solar cells.&lt;ref name="encyc of structure"/&gt;&lt;ref name=Altenergy&gt;{{cite web|last=Bhiwankar|first=Nikhil|title=Weathering the storm: Fluoropolymer films protect solar modules and ensure performance|publisher=altenergymag.com|year=2011|url=http://www.altenergymag.com/emagazine/2011/10/weathering-the-storm-fluoropolymer-films-protect-solar-modules-and-ensure-performance/1800|accessdate=31 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=DeBergalis&gt;{{cite journal|last=DeBergalis|first=Michael|title=Fluoropolymer films in the photovoltaic industry|journal=Journal of Fluorine Chemistry|year=2004|volume=125|pages=1255–1257|url=http://www2.dupont.com/Photovoltaics/en_US/assets/downloads/pdf/DeBergalis_flpr_films_wp.pdf|doi=10.1016/j.jfluchem.2004.05.013|issue=8}}&lt;/ref&gt;



Fluorinated [[ionomer]]s (polymers that include charged fragments) are expensive, chemically resistant materials used as membranes in certain electrochemical cells. [[Nafion]], developed in the 1960s, was the first example and remains the most prominent material in the class. The initial Nafion application was as a fuel cell material in spacecraft. Since then, the material has been transforming the 55&amp;nbsp;million&amp;nbsp;tons per year [[chloralkali]] industry; it is replacing hazardous mercury-based cells with membrane cells that are also more energy efficient. While older technology plants continue to run, new plants typically use membrane cells. By 2002, more than a third of the global capacity for the industry was membrane-cell based. Recently, the fuel cell application has reemerged; significant research is being conducted and investments made related to getting [[proton exchange membrane]] (PEM) fuel cells into vehicles.&lt;ref name="Fluorinated Ionomers"&gt;{{cite book|last=Grot|first=Walter|title=Fluorinated ionomers|year=2011|publisher=Elsevier|isbn=978-1-4377-4457-6|pages=1–10|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=E8H1Hwd5GXUC&amp;pg=PA6}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Functional Materials"&gt;{{cite book|last=Ramkumar|first=Jayshreee|title=Functional materials: Preparation, processing and applications|year=2012|publisher=Elsevier|isbn=978-0-12-385142-0|pages=549–578|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ep7U5G4O3mQC&amp;pg=PA567|editor=Banerjee, S|chapter=Nafion Persulphonate Membrane: Unique Properties and Various Applications}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Chlor-alkali and chlorate technology"&gt;{{cite book|last=Burney|first=H.

[[Fluoroelastomer]]s are rubber-like substances that are composed of [[crosslink]]ed mixtures of fluoropolymers. [[Viton]] is a prominent example. Chemical-resistant [[O-ring]]s are the primary application. Fluoroelastomers tend to be more stiff than conventional elastomers, but with superior chemical and heat resistance.&lt;ref name="encyc of structure"/&gt;

===Surfactants===

[[File:A water droplet DWR-coated surface2 edit1.jpg|thumb|alt=A shiny spherical drop of water on blue cloth.|Drop of water on a fabric treated with fluorinated surfactant]]

{{Main|Fluorinated surfactant|Durable water repellent}}

Fluorinated surfactants are small organofluorine molecules, principally used in durable water repellent (DWR). Fluorosurfactants form a large market, over $1 billion per year as of 2006. [[Scotchgard]] is a prominent brand, with over $300 million revenue in 2000.&lt;ref name="fluorosurfactant market"/&gt; Fluorosurfactants are expensive chemicals, comparable to pharmaceutical chemicals: $200–2000 per kilogram ($90–900 per pound).&lt;ref name="Fluorinated surfactants"&gt;{{cite book|last=Kissa|first=Erik|title=Fluorinated surfactants and repellents|year=2001|publisher=Marcel Dekker|isbn=0-8247-0472-X|pages=516–551|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=iAmE8v3bFnUC&amp;pg=PA522}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Fluorosurfactants make a very small part of the [[surfactant|overall surfactant market]], most of which is hydrocarbon based and much cheaper. Some potential applications (e.g. [[Surfactants in paint|low cost paints]]) are unable to use fluorosurfactants because of the price impact of compounding in even small amounts of fluorosurfactant. Use in paints was only about $100 million as of 2006.&lt;ref name="fluorosurfactant market"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Renner, R. |title=The long and the short of perfluorinated replacements |journal=Environmental Science &amp; Technology |volume=40 |issue=1 |year=2006 |pmid=16433328 |doi=10.1021/es062612a |pages=12–3|bibcode = 2006EnST...40...12R }}&lt;/ref&gt;

DWR is a [[Finishing (textiles)|finish]] (very thin coating) put on fabrics that makes them lightly rain resistant, that makes water bead. First developed in the 1950s, fluorosurfactants were 90% of the DWR industry by 1990. DWR is used with garment fabrics, carpeting, and food packaging. DWR is applied to fabrics by "dip-squeeze-dry" (immersion in DWR-water bath, pressing water out, and then drying).&lt;ref name="Ullman fibers"&gt;{{cite book|last=Ullman|first=Fritz|title=Ullmann's fibers: Textile and dyeing technologies, high performance and optical fibers|volume=2|year=2008|publisher=Wiley-VCH|isbn=978-3-527-31772-1|pages=538, 543–547|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=OKBKwGV5rSsC&amp;pg=PA543}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Fluorine gas==

For countries with available data (free-market countries), about 17,000&amp;nbsp;metric&amp;nbsp;tons of fluorine are produced per year by 11 companies, all [[G7]]-resident.{{sfn|Jaccaud et al.|2005|p=12}} Fluorine is relatively inexpensive, costing about $5–8 per kilogram ($2–4 per pound) when sold as uranium hexafluoride or sulfur hexafluoride. Because of difficulties in storage and handling, the price of pure fluorine gas is much higher.{{sfn|Jaccaud et al.|2005|p=12}} Processes demanding large amounts of fluorine gas generally [[vertical integration|vertically integrate]] and produce the gas onsite for direct use.

[[File:Uranium hexafluoride crystals sealed in an ampoule.jpg|Uranium hexafluoride in sealed tube|thumb]]

The largest application for elemental fluorine is the preparation of [[uranium hexafluoride]], which is used in the production of [[nuclear fuel]]s. To obtain the compound, [[uranium dioxide]] is first treated with hydrofluoric acid, to produce [[uranium tetrafluoride]]. This compound is then further fluorinated by direct exposure to fluorine gas to make the hexafluoride.{{sfn|Jaccaud et al.|2005|p=12}} Fluorine's monoisotopic natural occurrence makes it useful in [[uranium enrichment]], because uranium hexafluoride molecules will differ in mass only because of mass differences between uranium-235 and uranium-238. These mass differences are used to separate uranium-235 and uranium-238 via diffusion and centrifugation.&lt;ref name="AcountF"/&gt; Up to 7,000&amp;nbsp;metric&amp;nbsp;tons per year of fluorine gas are used for this application.{{sfn|Jaccaud et al.|2005|p=12}}  As of 2013, 686,500 metric tons of  UF6, containing about 470,000 metric tons of [[depleted uranium]] (the remainder being fluorine), were stored at the [[Paducah Gaseous Diffusion Plant]], the [[United States Enrichment Corporation|USEC's Piketon site, Ohio]] and the [[East Tennessee Technology Park]] (formerly known as the K-25 Site).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://web.ead.anl.gov/uranium/faq/storage/faq16.cfm |title= How much depleted uranium hexafluoride is stored in the United States? |author=Depleted UF6 Management Information Network   |work=web.ead.anl.gov |year=2013 |accessdate=27 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The second largest application for fluorine gas is [[sulfur hexafluoride]], which is used as a dielectric medium in high voltage switching stations. SF&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; gas has a much higher dielectric strength than air. It is extremely inert and, compared to oil-filled switchgear, has no hazardous [[polychlorinated biphenyl]]s (PCBs). Sulfur hexafluoride is also used in soundproof windows, in the electronics industry, as well as niche medical and military applications. The compound can be made without using fluorine gas, but the reaction between pure sulfur and pure fluorine gas, first developed by Henri Moissan, remains the commercial practice. About 6,000&amp;nbsp;metric&amp;nbsp;tons per year of fluorine gas are consumed.{{sfn|Aigueperse et al.|2005|p=35}}

Several compounds made from elemental fluorine serve the electronics industry. Rhenium and tungsten hexafluorides are used for [[chemical vapor deposition]] of thin metal films onto semiconductors. [[Tetrafluoromethane]], is used for [[plasma etching]] in [[semiconductor]] manufacturing, [[flat panel display]] production, and [[microelectromechanical systems]] fabrication.{{sfn|Jaccaud et al.|2005|pp=11–12}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=Wg1SnT6Cb0QC&amp;pg=PA317|page = 317|chapter = Fluorine –Based Plasmas|title = Fundamentals of semiconductor processing technology|isbn = 978-0-7923-9534-8|last = El-Kareh|first = Badih|year = 1994|accessdate=7 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|first1 = Leonel R.|last1 = Arana|first2 = Nuria|last2 = de Mas|first3 = Aleksander J.|last3 = Schmidt|last4 = Franz|first4 = Martin A. |first5 =Schmidt F. |last5 =Jensen |first6 = Klaus F. |last6 =Jensen|doi = 10.1088/0960-1317/17/2/026|title = Isotropic etching of silicon in fluorine gas for MEMS micromachining|journal= Journal Micromechanical Microenergy|year = 2007|volume = 17|page = 384|issue = 2|bibcode = 2007JMiMi..17..384A}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Nitrogen trifluoride]] is increasingly used for cleaning equipment at display manufacturing plants. Elemental fluorine, itself, is used sometimes for cleaning equipment.&lt;ref name="AcountF"/&gt;

For making niche organofluorines and fluorine-containing pharmaceuticals, direct fluorination is usually too hard to control. Preparation of intermediate strength fluorinators from fluorine gas solves this problem. The halogen fluorides ClF&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, BrF&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, and IF&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt; provide gentler fluorination, with a series of strengths. They are also easier to handle. Sulfur tetrafluoride is used particularly for making fluorinated pharmaceuticals.&lt;ref name="AcountF"/&gt;

United States and Soviet space scientists in the early 1960s studied elemental fluorine as a possible [[rocket fuel|rocket propellant]] because of the higher [[specific impulse]] generated when fluorine replaced oxygen in combustion. The experiments failed because fluorine proved difficult to handle, and its combustion product (typically hydrogen fluoride) was extremely toxic and corrosive.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite report|publisher=The Rand Corporation|accessdate=31 February 2011|last = Krieger|first=F.

==Production of fluorine gas==
[[File:Fluorine cell room.jpg|thumb|300px|Fluorine cell room at F2 Chemicals, [[City of Preston, Lancashire|Preston, England]].|alt=A machine room]]

Commercial producers of fluorine gas continue to use the method of electrolysis pioneered by Moissan, with some modifications in the cell design. Owing to the gas's corrosiveness, special containment materials and handling precautions are required. Chemical routes to the elemental form were published in 1986.

===Electrolytic synthesis===

Several thousand metric tons of elemental fluorine are produced annually by electrolysis of potassium bifluoride in hydrogen fluoride.&lt;ref name="AcountF"/&gt; Potassium bifluoride forms spontaneously from potassium fluoride and the hydrogen fluoride:

:HF + KF → KHF&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;

A mixture with the approximate composition KF•2HF melts at 70&amp;nbsp;°C (158&amp;nbsp;°F) and is electrolyzed between 70&amp;nbsp;°C and 130&amp;nbsp;°C (160–265&amp;nbsp;°F).&lt;ref name="ModFcchem"/&gt; Potassium bifluoride increases the electrical conductivity of the solution and provides the bifluoride anion, which releases fluorine at the anode (negative part of the cell). If HF alone is electrolyzed, hydrogen forms at the cathode (positive part of the cell) and the fluoride ions remain in solution. After electrolysis, potassium fluoride remains in solution.{{sfn|Jaccaud et al.|2005|pp=4–5}}

:2 HF&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt; → H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;↑ + F&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;↑ + 2 F&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;

The modern version of the process uses steel containers as cathodes, while blocks of carbon are used as anodes. The carbon electrodes are similar to those used in the electrolysis of aluminium. An earlier version of fluorine production process, by Moissan, uses [[platinum group]] metal [[electrode]]s and carved fluorite containers. The voltage for the electrolysis is between 8 and 12&amp;nbsp;volts.{{sfn|Jaccaud et al.|2005|p=6}}

===Handling===

[[File:Laboratory apparatus for reactions with fluorine gas.jpg|thumb|Laboratory setup for fluorine reactions, [[University of Freiburg]]]]

Pure fluorine gas may be stored in steel cylinders where the inside surface is passivated by a metal fluoride layer that resists further attack.{{sfn|Jaccaud et al.|2005|pp=4–5}}&lt;ref name="ModFcchem"/&gt; Passivated steel will withstand fluorine provided the temperature is kept below 200&amp;nbsp;°C (400&amp;nbsp;°F). Above that temperature, nickel is required. Regulator valves are made of nickel. Fluorine piping is generally made of nickel or [[Monel]] (nickel-copper alloy).{{sfn|Jaccaud et al.|2005|pp=10–11}} Care must be taken to passivate all surfaces frequently and to exclude any water or greases. In the laboratory, fluorine gas can be used in glass tubing provided the pressure is low and moisture is excluded,{{sfn|Jaccaud et al.|2005|pp=10–11}} although some sources recommend systems made of nickel, Monel, and PTFE.&lt;ref name="Shriver Inorganic"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Shriver|first1=Duward|last2=Atkins|first2=Peter|title=Solutions manual for inorganic chemistry|year=2010|publisher=Macmillan|isbn=978-1-4292-5255-3|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ZWKuqaeYXSEC&amp;pg=PA427|page=427}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Chemical routes===
In 1986, when preparing for a conference to celebrate the 100th anniversary of the discovery of fluorine, [[Karl O. Christe]] discovered a purely chemical preparation of fluorine gas; however, he stated in his work that the basics were known 50 years before the actual reaction.&lt;ref name=Kirsch2004&gt;{{Cite book | title = Modern fluoroorganic chemistry: Synthesis, reactivity, applications | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=aZoQP2YFsakC&amp;pg=PA7 | year = 2004 | author = Kirsch, Peer | page = 7 | isbn = 3-527-30691-9 | publisher = John Wiley &amp; Sons}}&lt;/ref&gt; The main idea is that some metal fluoride anions do not have a neutral counterpart (or those are very unstable) and their acidifying would result in chemical oxidation, rather than formation of the expected molecules. Christe lists the following reactions as a possible way:

:2&amp;nbsp;[[KMnO4|KMnO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;]] + 2&amp;nbsp;[[Potassium fluoride|KF]] + 10&amp;nbsp;[[Hydrogen fluoride|HF]] + 3&amp;nbsp;[[H2O2|H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]] → 2&amp;nbsp;K&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;MnF&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; + 8&amp;nbsp;H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O + 3&amp;nbsp;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;↑
:2&amp;nbsp;K&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;[[hexafluoromanganate|MnF&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;]] + 4&amp;nbsp;[[SbF5|SbF&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;]] → 4&amp;nbsp;K[[Hexafluoroantimonate|SbF&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;]] + 2&amp;nbsp;[[MnF3|MnF&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;]] + F&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;↑

This synthetic route is a rare chemical preparation of elemental fluorine, a reaction not previously thought possible.&lt;ref name='year'&gt;{{cite journal|author = Christe, K.|journal= [[Inorganic Chemistry (journal)|Inorganic Chemistry]]|volume = 25|pages = 3721–3724|doi = 10.1021/ic00241a001|title = Chemical synthesis of elemental fluorine|year = 1986|issue = 21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Félix Amiot (cropped).jpg|thumb|Félix Amiot in 1968]]
'''Félix Amiot''' (October 17, 1894 - December 21, 1974) was a French industrialist and aircraft constructor based in [[Colombes]], France. Some of the aircraft models he designed served in the French Air Force during the Second World War. His second industrial activity was shipbuilding for fishing boats, sailing and warship in [[Cherbourg]]. He became famous for designing and producing Missile Boat (Fast attack craft) type "Combattante" which he sold worldwide.
==Biography==

Born in a small shopkeepers' family, his father being a grocer, Félix Amiot spent his childhood in Cherbourg, where he studied at the local public High School: Lycée Victor Grignard. During his childhood, he became passionate about mechanics and aviation. In 1908, his family left Cherbourg to settle down in [[Issy-les-Moulineaux]], in the Paris suburbs, where the pioneers of the French aviation - [[Blériot Aéronautique|Blériot]], [[Voisin]], the brothers [[Farman]] – had built aviation sheds and proceeded to flying trials of their engines on a nearby exercise ground.
The proximity of the site was a strong inspiration for Amiot. In 1912, at the age of 18, he built his first plane in a garage near the training ground of [[Issy-les-Moulineaux]]. It was a two-seater monoplane, named after him: Amiot 01. In spite of the short-lived existence of this plane, damaged during a flight in 1913, Félix Amiot persevered with designing new planes.
In September, 1913, he registered his first patent for a "distribution system for fixed or rotary 2 or 4 times combustion engines ".

In September, 1914, Félix Amiot served in the army and was sent to the war front, where he stayed until October, 1915. He was then requested to work for [[Morane-Saulnier]], away from the front lines. He developed an assembly process for metallic parts using a stamping technic. The aircraft industry was very interested by the development of this technology, it attracted the attention of Louis Loucheur who was at the time, Secretary of Armaments. Loucheur suggested that Amiot become director of an  aircraft manufacturing factory. [[Pierre Wertheimer]], owner of [[Chanel]] and [[Bourjois]], financed Amiot's first company: "La Société d'Emboutissage et de Constructions Mécaniques" (SECM), based Avenue des Ternes, in Paris. SECM fabricated and repaired [[Morane-Saulnier]], [[Breguet Aviation|Breguet]] or [[Sopwith Aviation Company|Sopwith]] planes.
At the end of 1917, a second workshop was created in [[Colombes]].

In 1919, the SECM left the workshop at avenue des Ternes to settle down in a brand new factory in Colombes, in the close suburbs of Paris. In 1921, the SECM launched a design cabinet and began developing light passenger aircraft while at the same time, manufacturing planes under license - [[Breguet XIV]], [[Breguet XIX]], [[Farman F.50|Farman F. 50]], [[Dewoitine D.1|Dewoitine D1]]...
In 1926, the SECM produced [[Amiot 120]] among which the military by-product, Amiot 122, which was the first plane of the firm to be ordered in series by the French Army. The model became famous in 1927 and 1928 for a series of successful raids - Circuit of the Mediterranean Sea and Saharan circuit - and a double attempt, with an Amiot 123, at crossing the Atlantic Ocean in 1928 and 1929, piloted by the Polish crew - Idzikowski and Kubala&lt;ref&gt;Frédéric Patart, ''L’aventure Amiot-CMN, des hommes, le ciel et la mer.'', Éditions des Champs, Bricqueboscq, 1998&lt;/ref&gt;.
In 1928, in order to increase his activity, Félix Amiot acquired the seaplanes firm  [[Société Latham|Latham]], based in Caudebec-en-Caux.
In 1929, the SECM merged with several aircraft manufacturers around [[Lorraine-Dietrich]] to form the "Société Générale Aéronautique" (SGA). The brother Wertheimer and Amiot, as well as the shareholders, won impressive dividends. But in 1934, the company faced financial crisis. To avoid bankruptcy, the French State authorized Amiot and [[Bloch]] to buy back the bankrupt company. Amiot and the brother Wertheimer acquired it for a small amount of money.

In 1937, the SECM was partially nationalized : the Colombes factory was kept by Amiot, whereas Caudebec-en-Caux became a state owned company, becoming the [[SNCAN]]. To compensate for loss, Félix Amiot created in 1938 a new factory in his hometown [[Cherbourg]].
At Colombes and Cherbourg, he developed the [[Amiot 340]], 350 and 370, a series of bombers succeeding Amiot 143 which he had just produced in series for the French Air Force. These new models broke several records and acquired recognition :
- September 1937 to August 1939: an Amiot 370 piloted by Commander Maurice Rossi, broke a series of speed records for 1 000km , 2 000km and 5 000 Km distance with different loads of 500, 1000 and 2000 kilos.
- August 1938: the prototype Amiot 340 was chosen by General [[Vuillemin]], Chief of  Air Force Staff, on a diplomatic visit to Berlin.
- From 1938: the French Air Force ordered 1 800 Amiot 350 and by-products. The SECM received numerous requests to acquire the manufacturing license.
However, the planes mass production was affected by Amiot's bad relations with the   Air Ministry, and the constant technical changes required by the [[STAé]] - Service technique de l'Aéronautique. In January, 1939, [[Pierre Wertheimer]] left for the United States, aiming at establishing a factory in New-Orleans&lt;ref&gt;Frédéric Patart, ''L’aventure Amiot-CMN, des hommes, le ciel et la mer.'', Éditions des Champs, Bricqueboscq, 1998&lt;/ref&gt;.

'''WWII'''

In June 1940, the brother Wertheimer left urgently France for Brazil, then settled down in New-York, they asked Amiot to take care of their assets and business based in France and handed over to him all their SECM shares and majority stake in [[Chanel]] and [[Bourjois]] Perfumes. 
June 3rd 1940, in [[Le Bourget]], Amiot workshops were severely bombarded. Two days later, it was the turn of [[Cherbourg]]. On June 10th, Amiot evacuated his 3,000 workers staff to the south of France. He obtained 3 millions Francs from the government, then based in Bordeaux, in return for his pre-war orders. June 13th 1940, the French army, in violation with free city status, ordered the destruction by fire of the Colombes workshops. In retribution, the German Army occupied the factory which had been partially destroyed by the French army and looted by the German army, stole what was left and moved the workshop machines to [[Junkers]], a firm based in [[Dessau]] in Germany&lt;ref&gt;Frédéric Patart, ''L’aventure Amiot-CMN, des hommes, le ciel et la mer.'', Éditions des Champs, Bricqueboscq, 1998&lt;/ref&gt;.

After the Armistice, Amiot repatriated his staff to Paris. "Though” as he wrote in his Memoirs from  the Occupation, “I managed to subtract the design office and to keep it in the free zone". In order to recuperate late payments and to be financed by the French state, he settled his company in Vichy.
From Vichy, Amiot contacted the Resistance, they advised him to pursue his activity. In 1940, the German state contacted Amiot to request [[Junkers]]' planes. Unsure if he bellshould comply to the German's request and collaborate, Amiot wrote to Marshall [[Pétain]] to ask for instructions. Forced to work for the German occupant, he decided however not to get personally involved and left his company's management with two orders. Firstly, to slow down production as much as possible without attracting the attention of the German Occupant and put his staff in danger. Secondly, to enrol everyone who would ask for work at the factory without any discrimination: [[Service du travail obligatoire|STO]] objectors, resistants, communists or French Jews who were in hide such as Marie-Claire Servan-Schreiber&lt;ref&gt;L'Esprit de liberté, avec Catherine David, Presses de la Renaissance, 1992 ({{ISBN|2856166547}})&lt;/ref&gt;.
Amiot reconstituted a factory in Marseille and employed numerous workers who wanted to escape the STO (forced labour in Germany).  After the war, his behaviour was taken in consideration when his case was examined to assess his collaboration with the German forces.

In the spring 1942, Amiot employees aimed at recreating the industrial activity which was been disrupted by the war. They turned to Pierre Wertheimer, who, in the meanwhile, had become administrator to the aircraft manufacturer Bell in the United States. It was impossible to coordinate the two companies as they tried to establish a squadron at the colours of Free France in North Africa. Félix Amiot personally financed a resistance network which clandestinely helped 10 persons to escape to North Africa and sent information to the Allies. Unfortunately, the network was dismantled in May 1943, leading to the arrest by the Gestapo of Yves Maurice, head of design and close collaborator to Amiot, in Perpignan&lt;ref&gt;Frédéric Patart, ''L’aventure Amiot-CMN, des hommes, le ciel et la mer.'', Éditions des Champs, Bricqueboscq, 1998&lt;/ref&gt;.

However, Amiot was busy defending the interests of the Wertheimer brothers, he bought back their Perfume and beauty companies. At the end of the War, when Chanel and Bourjois accounts were settled, the Wertheimer brothers contested  Amiot's decision. Amiot had made fake documents to prove that the Wertheimer companies complied with aryan regulations imposed by the Nazi regime, whereas at the same time associating himself with [[Junkers Flugzeug und Motorenwerke AG|Junkers Flugzeug-und-Motorenwerke]] to build  370 [[Junkers Ju 52]] transport planes. After the Liberation, the Colombes company built its devices under the name AAC 01 Toucan. Amiot was questioned by the Gestapo, in September 1942. Amiot had held back the management of the Wertheimer's factories, in spite of [[Coco Chanel]]'s attempts to take control of the Perfumes bearing her name, helped by the relations she had with the Occupation German authorities&lt;ref&gt;Vaughan, Hal (2011). Sleeping with the Enemy: Coco Chanel's Secret War. New York: Knopf. {{ISBN|978-0-307-59263-7}}.&lt;/ref&gt;. Soon after the Liberation of Paris, Amiot received [[General Bradley]] at his castle of Boissière-Beauchamps in Lévis-Saint-Nom. Amiot sent a telegram to the Wertheimer brothers informing them of the liberation of France from Nazi Germany&lt;ref&gt;Frédéric Patart, ''L’aventure Amiot-CMN, des hommes, le ciel et la mer.'', Éditions des Champs, Bricqueboscq, 1998&lt;/ref&gt;.

After the war, [[Pierre Wertheimer]] launched judicial procedures against Amiot to recover some benefits. Amiot at the end of the war was in good financial situation. However, he was arrested on the 6th of September 1944 with the direction of the SECM accused of collaboration and "antisocial conduct". Quickly released, the charged were abandoned in 1947, after the tribunal cleared his name. The SECM, which had been requisitioned in 1944, was nationalised in 1946, through a private sale to the Government, ending its aeronautics activities.

'''After WWII'''

Amiot dedicated himself to the reconstruction of his factory in Cherbourg, which became the "[[Constructions Mécaniques de Normandie]]" (CMN) developing into  shipbuilding.
In 1948, the CMN launched their first ship : the trawler "Annie" for the "Chalutiers Cherbourgeois" ' fleet, taken back by Félix Amiot in 1946. He built various types of light military ships, minesweepers and mine hunters, patrol boats...

He was also interested in the sailing market, which started booming and produced the Maïca's series, long-distance yachts using glued laminated timber technology,  which had been designed by English naval architects [[John Illingworth (yacht designer)|John Illingworth]] and Angus Primrose, it became famous during the Fastnet race.
CMN shipbuildings counted among his customers known skippers such as [[Olivier de Kersauson]] or [[Eric Tabarly]]. A skilful businessman, Amiot conceived [[La Combattante class fast attack craft|La Combattante-class]], a missile-boat which was exported all over the world thanks to a good market analysis.

A few of his missile-boats became part of the famous event known as the [[Cherbourg Project|boats of Cherbourg]]&lt;ref&gt;Justin Lecarpentier, Rapt à Cherbourg : l'affaire des vedettes israéliennes, L'Ancre de Marine, 2010 ({{ISBN|978-2-84141-240-2}})&lt;/ref&gt;. On 1969 Christmas Christmas eve, 5 boats were illegally delivered to Israel, breaking the French embargo proclaimed by the General [[de Gaulle]] in 1969&lt;ref&gt;Rabinovich The Boats of Cherbourg Bluejacket Books {{ISBN|1-55750-714-7}} {{ISBN|978-1557507143}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Amiot was then 75 years old.

Félix Amiot was also a talented engineer-inventor who holds 100 patents to his name. One of the most important one is the stamping technology used to assemble metallic parts. Another one is the 1950 patent related to the improvement of fish preservation. At the beginning of 1950s, he worked on improving deep-sea trawlers. In 1960, he became one of the first in France to develop a licence for rear operating trawlers boats.

At his death on the 21st of December 1974, Félix Amiot left a worldwide recognised company employing more than 1,400 workers with booking orders for the 4 years to come. He was buried at [[Lévis-Saint-Nom]] cemetery, near his Boissière-Beauchamps property mansion.

'''Incidence rate (IR)''' in [[market research]] is a measure for the rate of occurrence or the percentage of persons eligible to participate in a study. 
For example, in a study of American washing machine owners, if the eligibility of research is defined as owning a washing machine then the IR will be the percentage of Americans who own a washing machine.

The '''Institute of Actuaries''' ({{lang-fr|Institut des Actuaires}}) is the association of [[actuary|actuaries]] in [[France]]. The Institute was created in 2001 by a merger of the Institute of Actuaries of France and the French Federation of Actuaries.&lt;ref&gt;Sibley, Angus: ''Nos collègues français'', [http://www.the-actuary.org.uk The Actuary], November 2006, p. 34-35&lt;/ref&gt; The Institute is a full member of the [[International Actuarial Association]] and the [[Groupe Consultatif]]. As of 2012, it has about 3 000 full members. Current president of the Institute is Thomas Behar.

In France the education of future actuaries will be facilitated by the national education system. The actuarial profession in France, in itself, has no such responsibility any more. But accrediting the diplomas awarded to the future actuaries is the responsibility of the French actuarial profession. Note that, these diplomas which accredited by French have access to the actuarial body. &lt;ref&gt;https://www.actuariesindia.org/downloads/gcadata/7thGCA/Frech%20Approach_Jean%20Berthon.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Jakob Heilmann''' (21 August 1846 in [[Geiselbach]], [[Aschaffenburg County]] ([[Lower Franconia]]) – 15 February 1927 in [[Munich]]) was a German [[general contractor|contractor]].

Son of a glazier, Heilmann attended the construction school in Munich and graduated with the exam as a master builder.
 
Since 1866, he was into railway construction and in 1871 established the builders J. Heilmann in Regensburg. In 1892, his son-in-law, the young architect Professor [[Max Littmann]] (1862-1931) joined him, so the construction company of [[Heilmann &amp; Littmann]] KG (after 1897 GmbH) came into existence. The real estate business was taken care by the [[Heilmann'sche Immobilien-Gesellschaft AG]] and several other related companies.

Heilmann engaged mostly in the building of family homes and mansions, among others in Munich Gern and in Solln-Prinz-Ludwigshöhe.

Magnificent and monumental buildings included the [[Schackgalerie]], the [[Prinzregententheater]], [[Süddeutscher Verlag|Münchener Neueste Nachrichten]], [[Hofbräuhaus]]-rebuilding in Munich and several health resort hotels in other parts of Bavaria.

After the partners Littmann and [[Richard Reverdy]] left in 1908 und 1909, his sons [[Albert Heilmann|Albert]] and [[Otto Heilmann|Otto]] joined the construction company..

Furthermore, Jakob Heilmann initiated the founding of the electric power provider [[Isarwerke]] GmbH.

A '''labour code''', (also called a ''code of labour laws'') is a [[Codification (law)|codification]] of [[labour law]]s in legislative form.

One of the first labour codes was first introduced in 1918 in the [[Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic]], as a legal framework underlying the requirement to ensure the right to work declared in the first Soviet Constitution.&lt;ref name="KZOT-1918"&gt;[http://www.hist.msu.ru/Labour/Law/kodex_18.htm Кодекс законов о труде 1918 года] // Приложение из учебного пособия И. Я. Киселева «Трудовое право России» (Москва, 2001). — Собрание Узаконений и Распоряжений Рабочего и Крестьянского Правительства РСФСР. 1918; № 87–88. Ст. 905&lt;/ref&gt;

In the aftermath of [[World War II|post-war]] the labour codes basing upon the same set of social guarantees were introduced in [[German Democratic Republic]], [[People's Republic of Hungary]], [[People's Republic of Poland]] and the other socialist countries in Central and Eastern Europe.

Presently the Labour Code exists in [[Russia|Russian Federation]] and in some other former Soviet Republics.

In Canada the [[Canada Labour Code|Labour Code]] (R.S., 1985, c. L-2) was adopted in 1985 superseding the [[Industrial Relations and Disputes Investigation Act of 1948]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title = Canada Labour Code

&lt;/ref&gt;

== USSR ==
&lt;BIG&gt;'''{{lang-ru|Кодекс законов о труде}}'''&lt;/BIG&gt;, [[abbreviation|abbr.]] ''КЗОТ'', "KZOT").

On July 10, 1918 the [[:ru:V Всероссийский съезд Советов|5th All-Russian Congress of Soviets]] adopted the Constitution of Russia which declared the right and duty to work for all citizen.&lt;ref name="c1918"&gt;[http://vivovoco.astronet.ru/VV/LAW/1918_W.HTM Constitution of the R.S.F.S.R. (1918)] // [[СУ РСФСР]]. 1918. № 51. ст. 582.&lt;/ref&gt; Pursuant to this the [[All-Russian Central Executive Committee]] approved the Code of Labour Laws  and the "Regulations on employment record books" as an Appendix to the Article&amp;nbsp;80 of this Code.&lt;ref name="KZOT-1918" /&gt;

'''Magnolia''' is a food and beverage brand owned by [[San Miguel Corporation]] (SMC) and used by its various subsidiaries. The brand was commercially established by SMC (then known as San Miguel Brewery) as an [[ice cream]] brand in 1925. 

==History==

The history of the Magnolia brand can be traced back to 1899 when an American by the name of William J. Schober arrived in the Philippines as a cook in the [[United States Army]]. After the [[Philippine–American War]], Schober would remain in the Philippines and introduced the "magnolia pie", "magnolia ice cream" and "magnolia ice-drop". In 1925, Schober sold his "magnolia" business interests to SMC (then known as San Miguel Brewery). Schober would move on to establish Legaspi Garden Restaurant at Pier 7, [[Port Area, Manila]] (the location is now the headquarters of [[Philippine Coast Guard]]), behind the [[Manila Hotel]]. 

Under SMC, the dairy plant at 526 [[Jose Laurel Street|Calle Aviles]] in the [[San Miguel, Manila|San Miguel district of Manila]] stood on the same street as the site of the original San Miguel brewery (6 [[Jose Laurel Street|Calle Aviles]]). In 1926, the dairy plant was relocated to Calle Echague (now C. Palanca Sr., Street) in [[Quiapo, Manila]].&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://csspsinag.blogspot.com/2010/03/ice-cream-story.html|title=The Ice Cream Story|website=SINAG-CSSP website|access-date=2016-10-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1970, production was transferred to a new modern facility in [[Aurora Boulevard]], [[Quezon City]], known as the [[Magnolia Dairy Products Plant]]. The facility also housed the main branch of its Magnolia [[ice cream parlor]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.magnoliaicecream.com.ph/ourCompany.php |title=Magnolia Ice Cream – About Us |last= |first= |date= |website= |publisher= |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120610023607/http://www.magnoliaicecream.com.ph/ourCompany.php |archive-date=10 June 2012 |access-date= |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1972, SMC entered the poultry business with its first breeder farm in [[Cavite]]. The following year, SMC established its first chicken processing plant in [[Muntinlupa]] to produce Magnolia Fresh Chicken. The poultry business, along with its B-Meg feeds business were operated as the Feeds and Livestock Division of SMC until it was spun-off as a new subsidiary (San Miguel Foods, Inc.) in 1991.

In 1981, SMC spun off its butter and margarine production to a new subsidiary named Philippine Dairy Products Corporation (now known as [[Magnolia, Inc.]]), a joint-venture with [[New Zealand Dairy Board]], with its production facility based in the Aurora Boulevard plant.

In 1996, SMC transferred its ice cream and milk businesses to a new company, Magnolia-Nestlé Corporation, a joint-venture with [[Nestlé]]. SMC retained ownership of the Magnolia brand since it was also being used by other SMC products. SMC also retained ownership of the Aurora Boulevard property. In 1998, SMC withdrew from the Magnolia-Nestlé venture and a [[non-compete]] clause barred it from the ice cream and milk businesses for five years. Upon the expiration of the non-compete clause in 2004, SMC revived its ice cream and milk businesses through its subsidiary, [[Magnolia, Inc.]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.wipo.int/ipadvantage/en/details.jsp?id=2598|title=Reimaging a Brand for a New Generation of Consumers|website=www.wipo.int|access-date=2016-10-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2008, SMC sold the Aurora Boulevard property to Robinsons Land Corporation (RLC), a subsidiary of [[JG Summit Holdings|JG Summit Holdings, Inc.]] News reports cited that the property was sold reportedly in the amount of P1.6 billion. The property was developed by RLC into a mall ([[Robinsons Magnolia]]) and residential condominiums (The Magnolia Residences).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.philstar.com/business/399416/rlc-close-finalizing-p16-b-purchase-magnolia-plant|title=RLC close to finalizing P1.6-B purchase of Magnolia plant|first=Zinnia|last=dela Pena|work=The Philippine Star|date=10 September 2008|access-date=24 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; One of the mall’s first establishments was a Magnolia-franchised ice cream parlor named '''Magnolia Flavor House''', which operated from 2012 to 2017, as a fitting homage to the property’s roots.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.abs-cbnnews.com/lifestyle/10/17/12/new-magnolia-house-goes-beyond-ice-cream|title=New Magnolia house goes beyond ice cream|first=|last=|work=ABS-CBN News|date=17 October 2012|access-date=24 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On May 19, 2010, Magnolia, Inc. inaugurated its main ice cream production facility in [[Santa Rosa, Laguna]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.gmanetwork.com/news/story/177181/economy/companies/magnolia-to-open-new-ice-cream-plant-in-laguna|title=Magnolia to open new ice cream plant in Laguna|last=|first=|date=17 November 2009|work=|newspaper=GMA News Online|access-date=23 October 2016|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine| url=http://sanmiguelpurefoods.com/uploads/corp/2013-04-10/v2jul7_FT_apr-jun2010.pdf | title=A Scoopful of Surprise: Magnolia Ice Cream Inaugurates Ice Cream Plant | date=April–June 2010 | author=Paola Lepatan|volume=5|issue=2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Trademark dispute==

In the United States, Ramar Foods International, a company founded in 1969 and based in [[Pittsburg, California]], markets its own line of ice cream under the Magnolia trademark "since 1972"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/ramar-foods-celebrates-40-years-of-magnolia-ice-cream-with-pledge-to-stay-mellorine-free-expanded-us-and-canadian-distribution-and-a-big-thanks-to-customers-209305421.html|title=Ramar Foods Celebrates 40 Years of Magnolia® Ice Cream with Pledge to Stay Mellorine Free, Expanded US and Canadian Distribution, and a Big Thanks to Customers!|last=International|first=Ramar Foods|date=|website=|publisher=PR Newswire|access-date=23 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; using a logo identical to that created and used by SMC. The company has no connection with SMC.

SMC currently exports its ice cream in the US and Canada under the San Miguel Gold Label brand and its line of butter, margarine and cheese to the US under the Magnolia brand.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.interaksyon.com/article/51260/cocktales--san-miguel-battles-magnolia-trademark-holder-to-sell-in-us|title=COCKTALES {{!}} San Miguel battles Magnolia trademark holder to sell in US|newspaper=InterAksyon.com|language=en-US|access-date=2016-10-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.interaksyon.com/business/57408/cocktales--malaysian-takeover-of-bank-of-commerce-stalls-on-pricing-issues|title=COCKTALES {{!}} Malaysian takeover of Bank of Commerce stalls on pricing issues|last=Agustin|first=Victor C.|date=18 March 2013|work=|newspaper=InterAksyon.com|language=en-US|access-date=23 October 2016|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a decision dated August 27, 2015, the [[United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit|Ninth Circuit U.S. Court of Appeals]] denied the appeal filed by Ramar on the March 2013 judgment of the U.S. District Court for the [[United States District Court for the Central District of California|Central District of California]] in favor of SMC regarding the use of the Magnolia brand on its butter, margarine and cheese products. Additionally, the Court of Appeals had reversed the injunction issued by the District Court that prevented SMC from using the Magnolia brand for new Magnolia food products in the United States. It noted that Ramar had failed to prove that it suffered any irreparable injury by SMC's use of the Magnolia trademark on its products in the United States. In rendering the decision, the US Court of Appeals recognized that SMC was using the Magnolia brand on its butter, margarine and cheese products to invoke the goodwill that SMC had built in the Philippines, not the goodwill created by Ramar in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.philstar.com/business/2015/09/03/1495239/san-miguel-secures-magnolia-brand-use-us|title=San Miguel secures Magnolia brand use in US|last=Gonzales|first=Iris|date=3 September 2015|work=|newspaper=The Philippine Star|access-date=23 October 2016|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://business.inquirer.net/198373/san-miguel-wins-magnolia-trademark-dispute-in-u-s|title=San Miguel wins 'Magnolia' trademark dispute in U.S.|last=Dumlao-Abadilla|first=Doris|date=2 September 2015|website=|publisher=The Philippine Inquirer|access-date=23 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Relation to other Magnolia brands (US and Singapore)==

Although similar in name and product line, there is no relation between SMC's Magnolia brand with that of the Singapore-based [[Fraser and Neave|Fraser and Neave Ltd.]] (whose [[F&amp;N Magnolia|Magnolia]] brand was established in Singapore in 1937 and currently known as '''F&amp;N Magnolia''').&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.magnolia.com.sg/history.html | title=The History of F&amp;N Magnolia | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120129052719/http://www.magnolia.com.sg/history.html | archivedate=2012-01-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is also no relation between SMC's Magnolia brand with that of [[Borden (company)|Borden, Inc.]] (Magnolia canned milk).

The network competes with two similarly formatted broadcast networks: [[This TV]] (originally operated by Weigel in a joint venture with [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer]], until the former's operational stake was taken over by [[Tribune Broadcasting]] on November 1, 2013) and [[GetTV]] (owned by [[Sony Pictures Entertainment]]); feature films compose the primary source and children's programming the ancillary source of programming on both networks, though This TV also broadcasts classic [[television series]]. However unlike This TV and GetTV, Movies! does not edit the films aired to make room for more commercials. A notation in the Movies! title card stating no film alterations is aired at the beginning of every film broadcast.  

==Background==
On January 28, 2013, Fox Television Stations and Weigel Broadcasting announced the formation of Movies!, with plans to launch the network on [[Memorial Day]] of that year.&lt;ref name="BC"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Weigel Fox"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Fox O&amp;Os, Weigel Launch Movies!"/&gt; Movies! officially launched on May 27, 2013, at 8:10 a.m. [[Eastern Time Zone|Eastern Time]], initially debuting on the subchannels of both of the network's co-parents: five [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]] and 11 [[MyNetworkTV]] [[owned-and-operated station]]s owned by Fox Television Stations, and two stations owned by Weigel. Its programming was inaugurated by a ten-minute clip introducing the network, followed by the first film to be telecast on Movies!, the 1975 film [[Western (genre)|Western]] ''[[Take a Hard Ride]]''.&lt;ref name="Weigel Movies!"&gt;{{cite news|title=Weigel Introducing New Movies!

==Programming==
===Movies===
Described as presenting "a variety of theatrical motion pictures in a new, viewer and advertiser friendly format, not seen on broadcast television to date",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Weigel Creates New Digital Network for Fox TV Stations|url=http://www.timeoutchicago.com/arts-culture/chicago-media-blog/16023001/weigel-creates-new-digital-network-for-fox-tv-stations|first=[[Robert Feder]]|work=[[Time Out (magazine)|Time Out Chicago]]|date=January 29, 2013|accessdate=June 12, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; films featured on Movies! consist primarily of releases from [[20th Century Fox]]; however, titles from [[Sony Pictures Entertainment]] (including those released by [[Columbia Pictures]] and [[TriStar Pictures]]), [[Paramount Pictures]] and [[Warner Bros.]] are also shown on the network.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Wily Indies Succeed on Digital Channels Where Majors Struggle|url=https://variety.com/2014/tv/news/wily-indies-succeed-on-digital-channels-where-majors-struggle-1201223064/|first=Chris|last=Gash|work=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]|date=June 18, 2014|accessdate=July 8, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The network's film roster concentrates mainly on classic films from the 1920s to the 1980s.&lt;ref name="Movies! Schedule"/&gt; Movies! broadcasts a featured movie presentation titled "Icons @ 8," airing nightly at 8:00 p.m. Eastern Time; described by the network in its promotions for the block as a "nightly celebration of cinema," the primetime showcase airs films featuring iconic movie stars from the "[[Golden Age (metaphor)|Golden Age]]" of cinema onward. It also broadcasts other themed presentations including a Saturday night block of films aimed at a female audience and a daily morning block of [[Western (genre)|Westerns]].&lt;ref name="moviesmonday"/&gt; Movies! presents many of its features in their original [[aspect ratio (image)|aspect ratio]] ([[widescreen]] or full screen) whenever possible,&lt;ref name="Weigel Fox"/&gt; which are either presented in the [[16:9]] or [[4:3]] [[letterboxing (filming)|letterboxed]] format depending on the affiliate's preference in transmitting the subchannel. Scope films, however, are often reformatted from [[2.35:1]] to 1.85:1. 

Films that are broadcast on the network are edited for graphic [[profanity]] and inappropriate violent or sexual content, but are not edited for running times to fit in a set time block;&lt;ref name="moviesmonday"&gt;{{cite news|title=Weigel introducing new MOVIES! channel Monday|url=http://www.jsonline.com/blogs/entertainment/208717551.html|first=Duane|last=Dudek|newspaper=''[[Milwaukee Journal Sentinel]]|date=May 23, 2013|accessdate=July 8, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; start and end times for films airing on the network are influenced by a combination of the film's original running time and the commercial breaks inserted within the broadcast (the network limits the amount of advertising featured during its programming to twelve minutes per hour),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://megamovies.cc/| title=megamovies.cc }} Wednesday, 28 December 2016 &lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="moviesmonday"/&gt; with airtimes for films varying between the conventional top-and-bottom-of-the-hour scheduling (e.g., 6:30 a.m. or 8:00 p.m.) and incremental airtimes in margins of five minutes (e.g., 2:10 p.m. or 3:55 a.m.) that more closely mirror the scheduling structures of [[pay television|premium cable channels]] than those of other advertiser-supported networks&lt;ref name="Weigel Movies!"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Movies! Schedule"/&gt; (this scheduling format, which still results in a particular film's running time to be somewhat longer than the original runtime of its theatrical release depending on the content edits, was replicated by GetTV when it launched in February 2014).

===Children's programming===
In order to meet requirements imposed by the [[Federal Communications Commission]] on the amount of [[E/I|educational programming content]] that a broadcast station must air each week, Movies! airs a three-hour block of children's programs that were originally distributed for [[broadcast syndication|syndication]] on Saturday mornings (currently featuring ''So You Want To Be'', ''Tomorrow/Today'' and ''Better Planet TV''). This allows its affiliates to carry the network's full schedule without having to purchase [[E/I]] programming from the syndication market to comply with the rules.&lt;ref name="Movies! Schedule"/&gt;

==Affiliates==
{{main|List of Movies! affiliates}}
As of July 2014, Movies! has current or pending affiliation agreements with television stations in 43 [[media market]]s encompassing 22 states and the [[Washington, D.C.|District of Columbia]], covering approximately 49% of the United States.&lt;ref name="MoviesFiveAffiliates"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tvnewscheck.com/article/76929/movies-network-signs-five-new-affiliates|title=Movies! Network Signs Five New Affiliates|publisher=''TVNewsCheck''|date=June 10, 2014|accessdate=July 5, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=re&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rabbitears.info/search.php?request=network_search&amp;network=Movies!|title=Stations for Network - Movies!|work=RabbitEars.info|accessdate=January 18, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fox Television Stations and Weigel Broadcasting launched Movies! in markets served by a station owned-and-operated by the Fox network or its sister programming service MyNetworkTV. Not all of the Fox Television Stations outlets carried Movies! at launch, [[WJZY]] in [[Charlotte, North Carolina|Charlotte]] (which came under Fox ownership one month prior to the network's debut) did not begin carrying Movies! until July 1, 2014,&lt;ref name="MoviesFiveAffiliates"/&gt; due to an existing affiliation agreement with [[Antenna TV]].

In [[Chicago]]—where Fox Television Stations and Weigel Broadcasting each own television stations—Fox-owned [[WPWR-TV]] serves as that market's charter affiliate of the network, instead of one of Weigel's three stations in that market ([[WCIU-TV]], [[WWME-CD|WWME-CA]] and [[WMEU-CD]]). This makes Movies! the first Weigel-owned network in which the company's Chicago [[flagship (broadcasting)|flagship]] stations do not serve as affiliates (WCIU formerly carried This TV under Weigel ownership before it moved to [[WGN-TV]] upon becoming part-owned by [[Tribune Broadcasting]] in November 2013, and [[MeTV]] is carried on WWME-CD and relayed a subchannel of WCIU). [[WBND-LD]] in [[South Bend, Indiana|South Bend]], [[Indiana]] carries Movies! on its third digital subchannel; [[WMLW-TV]] in [[Milwaukee]] carried the network from its launch until August 4, 2014, when Movies! moved to a newly created secondary subchannel of [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] affiliate [[WISN-TV]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?v=10154378657085284&amp;set=vb.27357795283&amp;type=2&amp;theater|title=Facebook status: We can't wait to launch our new "Movies! Milwaukee" network on August 4!|date=25 July 2014|publisher=[[WISN-TV]] via [[Facebook]]|accessdate=30 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following the WISN deal, that station's owner [[Hearst Television]] signed affiliation agreements on a piecemeal basis to add Movies! to select stations, mainly those affiliated with networks other than ABC, during late 2014 and early 2015 (Hearst already carries sister network MeTV in a majority of the markets where it owns stations).

In addition to its carriage on the Fox- and Weigel-owned outlets at the network's launch, the network is also carried on the digital subchannels of television stations owned by other broadcasting companies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Fox to Debut All Movie Network for Local TV Digital Subchannels|url=http://www.mediabistro.com/tvspy/fox-to-debut-all-movie-network-for-local-tv-digital-subchannels_b79010|author=Kevin Eck|publisher=''TVSpy'' (blog of [[Mediabistro.com]])|date=January 31, 2013|accessdate= June 12, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Soon after its launch, Movies! reached distribution agreements with several broadcasting groups to add the network on the subchannels of some of their stations. The first stations outside of the Fox and Weigel outlets to sign deals to carry the network were [[KFFV]] in [[Seattle]], [[WLWC]] in [[Providence, Rhode Island|Providence]] (both owned by OTA Broadcasting) and [[KPXJ]] in [[Shreveport, Louisiana|Shreveport]] (owned by [[KTBS-TV|KTBS, LLC]]) in October 2013, with the three stations adding the network between November 10 and December 10.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Movies!

Diginet Adds Nine Affiliates|url=http://www.tvnewscheck.com/article/71822/the-movies-diginet-adds-nine-affiliates|work=TVNewsCheck|date=November 7, 2013|accessdate=July 8, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Four additional stations (in [[Salt Lake City]]; [[Boise, Idaho|Boise]]; [[Wausau, Wisconsin|Wausau]]; and [[Victoria, Texas]]), through deals with companies such as the [[Nexstar Media Group|Nexstar Broadcasting Group]] and Saga Communications, added the network between May and October 2014.&lt;ref name="MoviesFiveAffiliates"/&gt;

'''New England Biolabs''' ('''NEB''') produces and supplies recombinant and native enzyme reagents for the [[life science]] research,&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Philippidis|first=Alex|date=15 March 2013|title=New England Biolabs Looks Past Enzymes|url=http://www.genengnews.com/gen-articles/new-england-biolabs-looks-past-enzymes/4769/|journal=[[Gen.

==The company==
Established in 1974 by [[Donald Comb]], as a cooperative laboratory of experienced scientists, and initially produced restriction enzymes on a commercial scale. The company then began producing solution-oriented products. It received approximately $1.7 million in Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) grants between 2009 and 2013 for this research.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; NEB produces 230 [[Recombinant DNA|recombinant]] and 30 native [[restriction enzyme]]s for [[genomic]] research, as well as [[nicking enzymes]] and DNA methylases. It pursues research in areas related to [[proteomics]], [[DNA Sequencing]], and [[drug discovery]]. NEB scientists also conduct basic research in Molecular Biology and Parasitology.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The company has subsidiaries in [[Singapore]], [[Canada]], [[China]], [[France]], [[Germany]], [[Japan]], and the U.K.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; and distributors in [[South America]], [[Australia]], and other countries in [[Europe]] and [[Asia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://investing.businessweek.com/research/stocks/private/snapshot.asp?privcapId=8382115 |publisher=Business Week |accessdate=May 7, 2014 |title=New England BioLabs Company Overview}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its headquarters are in Ipswich, MA. Development of the current headquarters began in 2000, and was completed in 2005.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bizjournals.com/boston/stories/2000/11/27/story7.html?page=all |accessdate=May 7, 2014 |date=November 27, 2000 |title=Firm plans $70M project on Ipswich 'great estate’ |author=Bill Archambeault |publisher=Boston Business Journal}}&lt;/ref&gt; Donald Comb served as the company’s Chairman and CEO from the company’s founding in 1974, until 2005. In 2005, he was replaced as chief executive by [[James Ellard]], though Comb remained Chairman. NEB employs about 350 people at its headquarters. As company policy, all scientists and some executives must work at least one day per month on the customer support telephone line, answering technical support questions about the company’s products.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Sir [[Richard John Roberts]] is the company’s Chief Scientific Officer.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://blogs.wsj.com/cio/2014/04/24/the-morning-download-tech-giants-act-to-stop-next-heartbleed/ |publisher=Wall Street Journal |date=April 24, 2014 |title=The Morning Download: Tech Giants Act to Stop ‘Next Heartbleed’ |author=Michael Hickens}}&lt;/ref&gt; He shared the 1993 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine with [[Phillip Allen Sharp]] for the discovery of introns in eukaryotic DNA and the mechanism of gene-splicing.

In 2015, NEB committed to establishing a [[Good manufacturing practice|GMP]] manufacturing facility near its headquarters in Ipswich, Massachusetts; the aim is to be fully validated and operational by 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

==Databases== 
The company runs free scientific databases. [[Rebase (database)|REBASE]], the restriction enzyme database, contains the details of commercial and research endonucleases.&lt;ref name="Terence A.

Brown 1998 41"/&gt;

==Partnerships==
In 2001, NEB co-founded the marine DNA library Ocean Genome Legacy (OGL), which according to the ''Boston Globe'', “catalogues samples of organisms from all over the world, to be made available to scientists for research”. Though originally located on the NEB campus, OGLF relocated to the Nahant campus of [[Northeastern University]] in 2014.&lt;ref name="Genome Web"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Rodney H.

The '''Nordic model''' refers to the economic and [[Social policy|social policies]] common to the [[Nordic countries]] ([[Denmark]], [[Finland]], [[Norway]], [[Iceland]], [[Greenland]], the [[Faroe Islands]] and [[Sweden]]). This includes a comprehensive [[welfare state]] and [[collective bargaining]] at the national level with a high percentage of the workforce [[labour unions|unionized]], while being based on the economic foundations of [[capitalism|free market capitalism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|first1=Anders |last1=Bruhn |first2=Anders |last2=Kjellberg |first3=Åke |last3=Sandberg |year=2013 |url=http://portal.research.lu.se/portal/files/19441202/Nordic_lights_kapitel_4_Bruhn_Kjellberg_Sandberg_Correct.pdf |title=A New World of Work Challenging Swedish Unions |editor-first=Åke |editor-last=Sandberg |location=Stockholm |pp=126–86}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.iea.org.uk/sites/default/files/publications/files/Sweden%20Paper.pdf |title=The surprising ingredients of Swedish success – free markets and social cohesion |date=June 25, 2013 |publisher=''[[Institute of Economic Affairs]]'' |accessdate=January 15, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="The Nordic Model: Pros and Cons"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.investopedia.com/articles/investing/100714/nordic-model-pros-and-cons.asp |title=The Nordic Model: Pros and Cons |date=June 25, 2013 |author=James E.

The [[Scandinavia]]n countries were all [[monarchy|monarchies]], with Finland and Iceland becoming republics in the 20th century; currently, the Nordic countries have been described as being [[Democracy_Index#Democracy_Index_by_country_(2017)|highly democratic]]. Although there are significant differences among the Nordic countries, they all share some common traits. These include support for a "universalist" welfare state aimed specifically at enhancing individual autonomy and promoting [[social mobility]]; a [[corporatist]] system involving a tripartite arrangement where representatives of labor and employers negotiate wages and labor market policy mediated by the government;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Hicks|first= Alexander|title= Social democracy and Welfare Capitalism: A century of Income Security Politics|publisher= Cornell University Press|date=January 20, 2000|isbn= 978-0801485565|page = 130|quote=By the late 1950s, labor had been incorporated alongside Swedish business in fully elaborated corporatist institutions of collective bargaining and policy making, public as well as private, supply-side (as for labour training) as well as demand side (e.g., Keynesian).

* Public [[pension]] plans.&lt;ref name="nordicmodel"/&gt;
* Free trade combined with collective risk sharing ([[welfare|social programs]], [[Labour economics|labour market]] institutions) which has provided a form of protection against the risks associated with economic openness.&lt;ref name="nordicmodel"/&gt;
* Little [[product market]] regulation. [[Nordic countries]] rank very high in product market freedom according to [[Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development|OECD]] rankings.&lt;ref name="nordicmodel"/&gt;
* Low levels of corruption.&lt;ref name="nordicmodel"/&gt; In Transparency International's 2015 [[Corruption Perceptions Index]], Denmark, Finland, Sweden, and Norway were ranked among the top 10 least corrupt of the 167 countries evaluated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.transparency.org/cpi2015#results-table |title=Corruption Perceptions Index 2015 |at=Full Table and Rankings |publisher=Transparency International |accessdate=1 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

These employees work in various fields including education, healthcare, and for the government itself. They often have greater job security and make up around a third of the workforce (more than 38% in Denmark). Public spending in social transfers such as unemployment benefits and early-retirement programmes is high. In 2001, the wage-based unemployment benefits were around 90% of wage in Denmark and 80% in Sweden, compared to 75% in the Netherlands and 60% in Germany. The unemployed were also able to receive benefits several years before reductions, compared to quick benefit reduction in other countries.

==Aspects==

===Labor market policy===
{{see also|Social corporatism}}
The Nordic countries share active labor market policies as part of a [[corporatist]] economic model intended to reduce conflict between labor and the interests of capital. The corporatist system is most extensive in Sweden and Norway, where employer federations and labor representatives bargain at the national level mediated by the government. Labor market interventions are aimed at providing job retraining and relocation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Rosser|first= Mariana V. and J Barkley Jr.|title= Comparative Economics in a Transforming World Economy|publisher= MIT Press|date=July 23, 2003|isbn= 978-0262182348|page = 226|quote=Liberal corporatism is largely self-organized between labor and management, with only a supporting role for government. Leading examples of such systems are found in small, ethnically homogeneous countries with strong traditions of social democratic or labor party rule, such as Sweden's Nordic neighbors. Using a scale of 0.0 to 2.0 and subjectively assigning values based on six previous studies, Frederic Pryor in 1988 found Norway and Sweden the most corporatist at 2.0 each, followed by Austria at 1.8, the Netherlands at 1.5, Finland, Denmark, and Belgium at 1.3 each, and Switzerland and West Germany at 1.0 each…with the exception of Iceland all the Nordic countries have higher taxes, larger welfare states, and greater corporatist tendencies than most social market economies.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Nordic labor market is flexible, with laws making it easy for employers to hire and shed workers or introduce labor-saving technology. To mitigate the negative effect on workers, the government labor market policies are designed to provide generous social welfare, job retraining and relocation to limit any conflicts between capital and labor that might arise from this process.&lt;ref name="James E. McWhinney"/&gt;

===Economic system===
The Nordic model is underpinned by a free market capitalist economic system that features high degrees of private ownership&lt;ref name="The Nordic Model: Pros and Cons"/&gt; with the exception of Norway, which includes a large number of [[State ownership|state-owned]] enterprises and state ownership in publicly listed firms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.economist.com/news/special-report/21570842-oil-makes-norway-different-rest-region-only-up-point-rich |title=Norway: The rich cousin |author= |date=2 February 2013 |publisher=The Economist |accessdate=27 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Nordic model is described as a system of competitive capitalism combined with a large percentage of the population employed by the [[public sector]] (roughly 30% of the work force).&lt;ref name="Economist leaders"&gt;{{cite news | url = https://www.economist.com/news/leaders/21571136-politicians-both-right-and-left-could-learn-nordic-countries-next-supermodel | title = The Nordic countries: The next supermodel | date = 2 February 2013 | publisher = [[The Economist]] | access-date = 27 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2013, ''[[The Economist]]'' described its countries as "stout free-traders who resist the temptation to intervene even to protect iconic companies" while also looking for ways to temper capitalism's harsher effects, and declared that the Nordic countries "are probably the best-governed in the world".&lt;ref name="Economist leaders" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = https://www.economist.com/news/special-report/21570835-nordic-countries-are-probably-best-governed-world-secret-their | title = The secret of their success | publisher = ''[[The Economist]]'' | date = 31 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some economists have referred to the Nordic economic model as a form of "cuddly" capitalism, with low levels of inequality, generous welfare states and reduced concentration of top incomes, and contrast it with the more "cut-throat" capitalism of the [[United States]], which has high levels of inequality and [[Income inequality in the United States|a larger concentration of top incomes]].&lt;ref name="nordicmodel" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://blogs.lse.ac.uk/europpblog/2014/01/29/lower-levels-of-inequality-are-linked-with-greater-innovation-in-economies/ | title = Lower levels of inequality are linked with greater innovation in economies | first1 = Jonathan | last1 = Hopkin | authorlink1 = Jonathan Hopkin | first2 = Victor | last2 = Lapuente | first3 = Lovisa | last3 = Moller | date = 29 January 2014 | publisher = [[London School of Economics]] | access-date = 27 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title = Social Democratic America | first = Kenworthy | last1 = Lane | authorlink = Lane Kenworthy | date = 3 December 2013 | isbn = 9780199322527 | publisher = [[Oxford University Press]] | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=eVTSAQAAQBAJ&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;pg=PA88#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false | pages = 88–93 | location = [[United States|USA]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Beginning in the 1990s, the Swedish economy pursued [[neoliberal]] reforms&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.socialistalternative.org/2014/03/22/13527/ | title = IS SWEDEN A MODEL TO FOLLOW? | first = Per-Åke | last = Westerlund | date = 22 March 2014 | website = [[Socialist Alternative (United States)|Socialist Alternative]] | access-date = 27 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.jacobinmag.com/2015/02/sweden-welfare-social-democracy-socialism/ | title = Beyond the Swedish Model | first = Michal | last = Rozworski | date = 27 February 2015 | magazine = [[Jacobin (magazine)|Jacobin]] | access-date = 27 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; that reduced the role of the public sector, leading to the fastest growth in inequality of any [[OECD]] economy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/may/23/swedish-riots-stockholm | title = Swedish riots rage for fourth night | publisher = [[The Guardian]] | date = 23 May 2013 | access-date = 27 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, Sweden's income inequality still remains lower than most other countries.&lt;ref name="nytimes"&gt;{{cite news |last=Higgins |first=Andrew |date=26 May 2013 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/05/27/world/europe/swedens-riots-put-its-identity-in-question.html?pagewanted=all |title=In Sweden, Riots Put an Identity in Question |work=[[The New York Times]] |access-date=29 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Norway's particularities ==== 
The state of Norway has ownership stakes in many of the country's largest publicly listed companies, owning 37% of the Oslo stockmarket&lt;ref name=Economist2&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.economist.com/news/special-report/21570842-oil-makes-norway-different-rest-region-only-up-point-rich|title=Norway: The rich cousin – Oil makes Norway different from the rest of the region, but only up to a point|date=2 February 2013|newspaper=The Economist|accessdate=1 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and operating the country's largest non-listed companies including [[Statoil]] and [[Statkraft]]. ''[[The Economist]]'' reports that "after the second world war the government nationalised all German business interests in Norway and ended up owning 44% of Norsk Hydro's shares. The formula of controlling business through shares rather than regulation seemed to work well, so the government used it wherever possible. 'We invented the [[Socialist market economy|Chinese way of doing things]] before the Chinese', says Torger Reve of the Norwegian Business School".&lt;ref name=Economist2/&gt; 

The government also operates a sovereign wealth fund, the [[Government Pension Fund of Norway]]—whose partial objective is to prepare Norway for a post-oil future, but "unusually among oil-producing nations, it is also a big advocate of human rights—and a powerful one, thanks to its control of the Nobel peace prize".&lt;ref name=Economist/&gt;

Norway is the only major economy in the West where younger generations are getting richer, with a 13% increase in disposable income for 2018, bucking the trend seen in other Western nations of millennials becoming poorer than the generations which came before.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last= Savage|first=Maddy|date=July 10, 2018 |title=Unlike most millennials, Norway's are rich |url=http://www.bbc.com/capital/story/20180709-unlike-most-millennials-norways-are-rich|work=BBC |location= |access-date=July 11, 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Nordic welfare model refers to the [[welfare]] [[Social policy|policies]] of the Nordic countries, which also tie into their labor market policies. The Nordic model of welfare is distinguished from other types of welfare states by its emphasis on maximizing labor force participation, promoting  [[gender equality]], [[egalitarianism|egalitarian]] and extensive benefit levels, the large magnitude of income redistribution and liberal use of expansionary fiscal policy.&lt;ref name="Esping-Andersen"&gt;{{cite book |last=Esping-Andersen |first=G. |year=1991 |title=The three worlds of welfare capitalism |location=Princeton, NJ |publisher=Princeton University Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While there are differences among different Nordic countries, they all share a broad commitment to social cohesion, a universal nature of welfare provision in order to safeguard individualism by providing protection for vulnerable individuals and groups in society and maximizing public participation in social decision-making. It is characterized by flexibility and openness to innovation in the provision of welfare. The Nordic welfare systems are mainly funded through [[taxation]].&lt;ref name="The Nordic Council"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.norden.org/en/about-nordic-co-operation/areas-of-co-operation/the-nordic-welfare-model/about-the-nordic-welfare-model |title=About the Nordic welfare model  |author=The Nordic Council |date= |publisher=Norden |accessdate=2 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite the common values, the Nordic countries take different approaches to the practical administration of the welfare state. Denmark features a high degree of private sector provision of public services and welfare, alongside an assimilation immigration policy. Iceland's welfare model is based on a "welfare-to-work" (see: [[workfare]]) model while part of Finland's welfare state includes the [[voluntary sector]] playing a significant role in providing care for the elderly. Norway relies most extensively on public provision of welfare.&lt;ref name="The Nordic Council"/&gt;

====Poverty reduction====
The Nordic model has been successful at significantly reducing poverty.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine |first=Kevin |last=Drum |date=26 September 2013 |url=https://www.motherjones.com/kevin-drum/2013/09/we-can-reduce-poverty-if-we-want-we-just-have-want |title=We Can Reduce Poverty If We Want To. We Just Have To Want To. |work=[[Mother Jones (magazine)|Mother Jones]] |access-date=5 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2011, poverty rates before taking into account the effects of taxes and transfers stood at 24.7% in Denmark, 31.9% in Finland, 21.6% in Iceland, 25.6% in Norway and 26.5% in Sweden. After accounting for taxes and transfers the poverty rates for the same year became 6%, 7.5%, 5.7%, 7.7% and 9.7% respectively, for an average reduction of 18.7 p.p.&lt;ref name="compareyourcountry.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.compareyourcountry.org/inequality?cr=usa&amp;lg=en|title=Compare your country – Income distribution and poverty|publisher=[[OECD]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Compared to the United States, which has a poverty level pre-tax of 28.3% and post-tax of 17.4% for a reduction of 10.9 p.p., the effects of tax and transfers on poverty in all the Nordic countries are substantially bigger.&lt;ref name="compareyourcountry.org"/&gt; However, in comparison to France (27 p.p. reduction) and Germany (24.2 p.p. reduction) the taxes and transfers in the Nordic countries are smaller on average.&lt;ref name="compareyourcountry.org"/&gt;

=== Religion as a factor ===
Scandinavian countries have [[Lutheranism]] as their main religion. Schroder argues that Lutheranism promotes the idea of a nationwide community of believers and it promotes state involvement in economic and social life. This allows nationwide welfare solidarity and economic coordination.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Martin |last=Schröder |title=Integrating Varieties of Capitalism and Welfare State Research |publisher=Palgrave Macmillan |year=2013 |page=157}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Currently, a large number of Scandinavians have been described as being [[irreligious]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Steinfels |first=Peter |date=February 27, 2009 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/02/28/us/28beliefs.html |title=Scandinavian Nonbelievers, Which Is Not to Say Atheists |work=The New York Times |access-date=March 21, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception==
The Nordic model has been positively received by some American politicians and political commentators. [[Jerry Mander]] has likened the Nordic model to a kind of "hybrid" system which features a blend of [[capitalist]] economics with [[socialist]] values, representing an alternative to [[Anglo-Saxon model|American-style capitalism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine| author-link=Jerry Mander |first=Jerry |last=Mander |date=24 July 2013 |url=http://www.alternet.org/books/there-are-good-alternatives-us-capitalism-no-way-get-there?page=0%2C2 |title=There Are Good Alternatives to US Capitalism, But No Way to Get There |work=[[Alternet]] |access-date=27 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; United States Senator [[Bernie Sanders]] (I-VT) has pointed to Scandinavia and the Nordic model as something America can learn from, in particular with respect to the benefits and social protections the Nordic model affords workers and its provision of universal healthcare.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last=Sanders |first=Bernie |date=May 26, 2013 |url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/rep-bernie-sanders/what-can-we-learn-from-de_b_3339736.html |title=What Can We Learn From Denmark? |work=[[The Huffington Post]] |access-date=11 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Sasha|last=Issenberg|date=January 9, 2010|url=http://www.boston.com/news/nation/washington/articles/2010/01/09/sanders_a_growing_force_on_the_far_far_left/?page=1|title=Sanders a growing force on the far, far left|newspaper=[[Boston Globe]]|quote=You go to Scandinavia, and you will find that people have a much higher standard of living, in terms of education, health care, and decent paying jobs.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Zeeshan |last=Aleem |date=May 4, 2015 |url=http://mic.com/articles/117334/bernie-sanders-says-the-u-s-could-learn-a-lot-from-scandinavia-here-s-why-he-s-right |title=Bernie Sanders Says the U.S. Could Learn a Lot From Scandinavia. Here’s Why He's Right |work=[[Mic (media company)|Mic]] |access-date=May 5, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[Naomi Klein]], former Soviet leader [[Mikhail Gorbachev]] sought to move the [[Soviet Union]] in a similar direction to the Nordic system, combining free markets with a social safety net but still retaining public ownership of key sectors of the economy - ingredients that he believed would transform the Soviet Union into "a socialist beacon for all mankind".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author-link=Naomi Klein |last=Klein |first=Naomi |year=2008 |title=The Shock Doctrine: The Rise of Disaster Capitalism |publisher=[[Picador (imprint)|Picador]] |ISBN=0312427999 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=PwHUAq5LPOQC&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;pg=PA276#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |page=276}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first1=Philip |last1=Whyman |first2=Mark |last2=Baimbridge |first3=Andrew |last3=Mullen |year=2012 |title=The Political Economy of the European Social Model (Routledge Studies in the European Economy |publisher=[[Routledge]] |ISBN=0415476291 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=e-M_cdwdgoMC&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;pg=PA108#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |page=108 |quote=In short, Gorbachev aimed to lead the Soviet Union towards the Scandinavian social democratic model.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Nordic model has also been positively received by various social scientists and economists. American professor of sociology and political science [[Lane Kenworthy]] advocates for the United States to make a gradual transition toward a social democracy similar to those of the Nordic countries, defining social democracy as "The idea behind social democracy was to make capitalism better. There is disagreement about how exactly to do that, and others might think the proposals in my book aren't true social democracy. But I think of it as a commitment to use government to make life better for people in a capitalist economy. To a large extent, that consists of using public insurance programs—government transfers and services".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Matthews |first=Dylan |date=9 January 2014 |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/wonkblog/wp/2014/01/09/this-sociologist-has-a-plan-to-make-america-more-like-sweden/ |title=This sociologist has a plan to make America more like Sweden |work=[[The Washington Post]] |access-date=11 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nobel Prize-winning economist [[Joseph Stiglitz]] has noted that there is higher social mobility in the Scandinavian countries than in the United States and argues that Scandinavia is now the land of opportunity that the United States once was.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://money.cnn.com/2015/06/03/news/economy/stiglitz-income-inequality/index.html |title='Scandinavian Dream' is true fix for America's income inequality |work=CNN Money |date=June 3, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; American author [[Ann Jones (author)|Ann Jones]], who lived in Norway for four years, contends "the Nordic countries give their populations freedom ''from'' the market by using capitalism as a tool to benefit everyone", whereas in the United States "[[neoliberal]] politics puts the foxes in charge of the henhouse, and capitalists have used the wealth generated by their enterprises (as well as financial and political manipulations) to capture the state and pluck the chickens".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.thenation.com/article/after-i-lived-in-norway-america-felt-backward-heres-why/ |title=After I Lived in Norway, America Felt Backward. Here’s Why |work=[[The Nation]] |date=January 28, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Economist [[Jeffrey Sachs]] is a proponent of the Nordic model, having pointed out that the Nordic model is "the proof that modern capitalism can be combined with decency, fairness, trust, honesty, and environmental sustainability."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.globalhealthminders.dk/prof-jeffrey-sachs-plea-to-the-nordic-countries/ |title=Prof Jeffrey Sachs’ plea to the Nordic countries |work=Global Health Minders |date=November 18, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Nordic combination of extensive public provision of [[welfare]] and a culture of [[individualism]] has been described by Lars Trägårdh, of [[Ersta Sköndal University College]], as "[[Statism|statist]] individualism".&lt;ref name="Economist"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.economist.com/news/special-report/21570835-nordic-countries-are-probably-best-governed-world-secret-their |title=The secret of their success |work=[[The Economist]] |date=2 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2016 survey by the think tank [[Israel Democracy Institute]] found that nearly 60 percent of [[Israeli Jews]] preferred a "Scandinavian model" economy, with high taxes and a robust welfare state.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Sales|first=Ben|title=Survey: Israeli Jews Want Broader Welfare State, Israeli Arabs Prefer 'American Model'|url=http://www.haaretz.com/israel-news/1.721012|work=[[Haaretz]]|date=23 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Misconceptions===
George Lakey, author of ''Viking Economics'', asserts that Americans generally misunderstand the nature of the Nordic "welfare state":

&lt;blockquote&gt;Americans imagine that "welfare state" means the U.S. welfare system on steroids. Actually, the Nordics scrapped their American-style welfare system at least 60 years ago, and substituted universal services, which means everyone—rich and poor—gets free higher education, free medical services, free eldercare, etc. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine |url=http://americamagazine.org/content/all-things/continuing-revelation-scandinavian-economies |title=The “Continuing Revelation” of Scandinavian Economies |work=americanmagazine.org |date=July 22, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In his role as economic adviser to Poland and Yugoslavia in their post-socialist transitional period, Jeffrey Sachs noted that the specific forms of Western-style capitalism such as Swedish-style social democracy and Thatcherite liberalism are virtually identical:

&lt;blockquote&gt;The eastern countries must reject any lingering ideas about a “third way”, such as a chimerical “market socialism” based on public ownership or worker self-management, and go straight for a western-style market economy...The main debate in economic reform should therefore be about the means of transition, not the ends. Eastern Europe will still argue over the ends: for example, whether to aim for Swedish-style social democracy or Thatcherite liberalism. But that can wait. Sweden and Britain alike have nearly complete private ownership, private financial markets and active labour markets. Eastern Europe today [in 1990] has none of these institutions; for it, the alternative models of Western Europe are almost identical.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.economist.com/node/13002085 |work=The Economist |date=January 13, 1990 |title=What is to be done?}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In a speech at Harvard's Kennedy School of Government, Danish Prime Minister [[Lars Løkke Rasmussen]] addressed the American misconception that the Nordic model is a form of socialism: "'I know that some people in the US associate the Nordic model with some sort of socialism,' he said. 'Therefore, I would like to make one thing clear. Denmark is far from a socialist planned economy. Denmark is a market economy.'"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine |url=https://www.vox.com/2015/10/31/9650030/denmark-prime-minister-bernie-sanders |title=Denmark's prime minister says Bernie Sanders is wrong to call his country socialist |work=Vox |date=31 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism==
The socialist economists [[John Roemer]] and [[Pranab Bardhan]] criticize Nordic-style social democracy for its questionable effectiveness in promoting relative [[egalitarianism]] as well as its [[sustainability]]. They point out that Nordic social democracy requires a strong [[labour movement|labor movement]] to sustain the heavy redistribution required, arguing that it is idealistic to think similar levels of redistribution can be accomplished in countries with weaker labor movements. They note that even in the Scandinavian countries social democracy has been in decline since the weakening of the labor movement in the early 1990s, arguing that the sustainability of social democracy is limited. Roemer and Bardham argue that establishing a [[market socialist]] economy by changing enterprise ownership would be more effective than social democratic redistribution at promoting egalitarian outcomes, particularly in countries with weak labor movements.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Market socialism, a case for rejuvenation |first1=Pranab |last1=Bardhan |first2=Johen E. |last2=Roemer |year=1992 |journal=Journal of Economic Perspectives |volume=6 |number=3 |page=104 |quote=...we believe that social democracy requires rather special political circumstances that are absent in many countries for which our market socialism proposal may be feasible. Since it (social democracy) permits a powerful capitalist class to exist (90 percent of productive assets are privately owned in Sweden), only a strong and unified labor movement can win the redistribution through taxes that is characteristic of social democracy. It is idealistic to believe that tax concessions of this magnitude can be effected simply through electoral democracy without an organized labor movement, when capitalists organize and finance influential political parties. Even in the Scandinavian countries, strong apex labor organizations have been difficult to sustain and social democracy is somewhat on the decline now.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Historian Guðmundur Jónsson argues that it would be inaccurate to include Iceland in one aspect of the Nordic model, that of [[consensus democracy]]. He writes that "Icelandic democracy is better described as more adversarial than consensual in style and practice. The labour market was rife with conflict and strikes more frequent than in Europe, resulting in strained government–trade union relationship. Secondly, Iceland did not share the Nordic tradition of power-sharing or corporatism as regards labour market policies or macro-economic policy management, primarily because of the weakness of Social Democrats and the Left in general. Thirdly, the legislative process did not show a strong tendency towards consensus-building between government and opposition with regard to government seeking consultation or support for key legislation. Fourthly, the political style in legislative procedures and public debate in general tended to be adversarial rather than consensual in nature".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Iceland and the Nordic Model of Consensus Democracy |journal = Scandinavian Journal of History|date = 2014-08-08|issn = 0346-8755|pages = 510–28|volume = 39|issue = 4|doi = 10.1080/03468755.2014.935473|first = Guðmundur|last = Jónsson}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In their paper "The Scandinavian Fantasy: The Sources of Intergeneration Mobility in Denmark and the U.S.", Rasmus Landersøn and James J. Heckman compared American and Danish social mobility and found that social mobility is not as high as figures might suggest in the Nordic countries. When looking exclusively at wages (before taxes and transfers), Danish and American social mobility are very similar. It is only after taxes and transfers are taken into account that Danish social mobility improves, indicating that Danish economic redistribution policies simply give the impression of greater mobility. Additionally, Denmark's greater investment in public education did not improve educational mobility significantly, meaning children of non-college educated parents are still unlikely to receive college education, though this public investment did result in improved cognitive skills amongst poor Danish children compared to their American peers. The researchers also found evidence that generous welfare policies could discourage the pursuit of higher-level education due to decreasing the economic benefits that college education level jobs offer and increasing welfare for workers of a lower education level.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first1=Rasmus |last1=Landersøn |first2=James J. |last2=Heckman |title=The Scandinavian Fantasy: The Sources of Intergenerational Mobility in Denmark and the US |journal=[[Scandinavian Journal of Economics]] |volume=119 |issue=1 |year=2017 |pages=178–230 |doi=10.1111/sjoe.12219 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Nima Sanandaji]], a [[libertarian]], has also criticized the Nordic model, questioning the link between the model and socio-economic outcomes in works of his such as ''Scandinavian Unexceptionalism'' and ''Debunking Utopia: Exposing the Myth of Nordic Socialism''.

==Political ideologies in the Nordic countries==
According to sociologist [[Lane Kenworthy]], in the context of the Nordic model "[[social democracy]]", the ideology of the Nordic labour parties, refers to a set of policies for promoting economic security and opportunity within the framework of capitalism rather than a replacement for capitalism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/140345/lane-kenworthy/americas-social-democratic-future |title=America's Social Democratic Future |author=Lane Kenworthy |date=January 2014 |publisher=Foreign Affairs |accessdate=2 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:pepperseggplants.jpg|thumb|Organic fruits and vegetables at a [[farmers' market]] in Argentina]]

'''Organic food''' is [[food]] produced by methods that comply with the standards of [[organic farming]]. Standards vary worldwide, but organic farming in general features practices that strive to cycle resources, promote ecological balance, and conserve [[biodiversity]]. Organizations regulating organic products may restrict the use of certain [[pesticide]]s and [[fertilizer]]s in farming. In general, organic foods are also usually not processed using [[Food irradiation|irradiation]], industrial solvents or synthetic [[food additives]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ocf.berkeley.edu/~lhom/organictext.html |title=Pesticides in Organic Farming |quote=Organic foods are not necessarily pesticide-free. Organic foods are produced using only certain pesticides with specific ingredients. Organic pesticides tend to have substances like soaps, lime sulfur and [[hydrogen peroxide]] as ingredients. Not all natural substances are allowed in organic agriculture; some chemicals like arsenic, strychnine, and tobacco dust (nicotine sulfate) are prohibited.|publisher=[[University of California, Berkeley]] |accessdate=2014-06-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Currently, the European Union, the United States, Canada, Mexico, Japan, and many other countries require producers to obtain [[Organic certification|special certification]] in order to market food as organic within their borders. In the context of these [[regulations]], organic food is produced in a way that complies with organic standards set by regional organizations, national governments and international organizations. Although the produce of [[kitchen garden]]s may be organic, selling food with an organic label is regulated by governmental food safety authorities, such as the [[National Organic Program|US Department of Agriculture]] (USDA) or [[European Commission]] (EC).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://ec.europa.eu/agriculture/organic/organic-farming/what-is-organic-farming/organic-certification/index_en.htm|title=Organic certification|publisher=European Commission: Agriculture and Rural Development|date=2014|accessdate=10 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Fertilizing and the use of pesticides in conventional farming has caused, and is causing, enormous damage worldwide to local [[ecosystem]]s, biodiversity, [[groundwater]] and [[drinking water]] supplies, and sometimes farmer health and [[fertility]]. These environmental, economic and health issues are intended to be minimized or avoided in organic farming. From a consumers perspective, there is not sufficient evidence in scientific and [[medical literature]] to support claims that organic food is [[Food safety|safer]] or healthier to eat than conventionally grown food.

==Meaning and origin of the term==
{{details|topic=the production of organic food|Organic farming}}

For the vast majority of its history, agriculture can be described as having been organic; only during the 20th century was a large supply of new products, generally deemed not organic, introduced into food production.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jhsph.edu/research/centers-and-institutes/teaching-the-food-system/curriculum/_pdf/History_of_Food-Background.pdf|title=History of food, p. 3|author=|date=|website=jhsph.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt; The organic farming movement arose in the 1940s in response to the [[industrialization]] of [[agriculture]].&lt;ref name=Drinkwater&gt;{{cite book|author=Drinkwater, Laurie E.|chapter=Ecological Knowledge: Foundation for Sustainable Organic Agriculture|editor=Francis, Charles|title=Organic farming: the ecological system|publisher=ASA-CSSA-SSSA|year=2009|isbn=978-0-89118-173-6|page=19|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8HMfbQpNq60C&amp;pg=PA19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1939, [[Walter James, 4th Baron Northbourne|Lord Northbourne]] coined the term ''organic farming'' in his book ''Look to the Land'' (1940), out of his conception of "the farm as organism," to describe a holistic, ecologically balanced approach to farming—in contrast to what he called ''chemical farming,'' which relied on "imported fertility" and "cannot be self-sufficient nor an organic whole."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=John, Paull|title=The Farm as Organism: The Foundational Idea of Organic Agriculture|journal = Elementals: Journal of Bio-Dynamics Tasmania|volume=80|year=2006|pages=14–18|url=http://orgprints.org/10138/01/10138.pdf|format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt; Early soil scientists also described the differences in soil composition when animal manures were used as "organic", because they contain carbon compounds where superphosphates and haber process nitrogen do not. Their respective use affects [[humus]] content of soil.&lt;ref name=Betteshanger&gt;Paull, John (2011) [http://orgprints.org/19511/1/Paull2011BetteshangerJOS.pdf  "The Betteshanger Summer School: Missing link between biodynamic agriculture and organic farming"], ''Journal of Organic Systems'', 2011, 6(2):13-26.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Howard|first1=Sir Albert|title=Farming and Gardening for Health or Disease (The Soil and Health)|url=http://journeytoforever.org/farm_library/howardSH/SHtoc.html|website=Journey to forever online library|publisher=Faber and Faber Limited|accessdate=18 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is different from the scientific use of the term "organic" in chemistry, which refers to [[organic compound|a class of molecules that contain carbon]], especially those involved in the chemistry of life. This class of molecules includes everything likely to be considered edible, and include most pesticides and toxins too, therefore the term "organic" and, especially, the term "inorganic" (sometimes wrongly used as a contrast by the popular press) as they apply to organic chemistry is an equivocation fallacy when applied to farming, the production of food, and to foodstuffs themselves. Properly used in this agricultural science context, "organic" refers to the methods grown and processed, not necessarily the chemical composition of the food.

Ideas that organic food could be healthier and better for the environment originated in the early days of the [[organic movement]] as a result of publications like the 1943 book [[The Living Soil]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Balfour|first1=Lady Eve|title=Towards a Sustainable Agriculture--The Living Soil|url=http://www.soilandhealth.org/01aglibrary/010116Balfourspeech.html|publisher=IFOAM|accessdate=20 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Lady Balfour|url=http://www.ifoam.org/en/lady-eve-balfour|website=IFOAM|accessdate=21 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; and ''Farming and Gardening for Health or Disease'' (1945).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Howard|first1=Sir Albert|title=Farming and Gardening for Health or Disease (The Soil and Health)|url=http://journeytoforever.org/farm_library/howardSH/SH10.html|website=Journey to forever online library|publisher=Faber and Faber Limited|accessdate=18 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the industrial era, organic gardening reached a modest level of popularity in the United States in the 1950s. In the 1960s, environmentalists and the counterculture championed organic food, but it was only in the 1970s that a national marketplace for organic foods developed.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=UjEtDwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT302&amp;dq=whole+foods#v=onepage&amp;q=whole%20foods&amp;f=false|title=From Head Shops to Whole Foods: The Rise and Fall of Activist Entrepreneurs|last=Davis|first=Joshua Clark|date=2017-08-08|publisher=Columbia University Press|isbn=9780231543088|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Early consumers interested in organic food would look for non-chemically treated, non-use of unapproved pesticides, fresh or minimally processed food. They mostly had to buy directly from growers. Later, "Know your farmer, know your food" became the motto of a new initiative instituted by the USDA in September 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Philpott|first=Tom|title=Quick thoughts on the USDA's 'Know Your Farmer' program|url=http://grist.org/article/2009-09-16-quick-thoughts-on-the-usdas-know-your-farmer-program|website=Grist * A Beacon in the Smog|publisher=Grist Magazine, Inc.|accessdate=2014-01-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; Personal definitions of what constituted "organic" were developed through firsthand experience: by talking to farmers, seeing farm conditions, and farming activities. Small farms grew vegetables (and raised livestock) using [[organic farming]] practices, with or without certification, and the individual consumer monitored.{{citation needed|date=March 2013}} Small specialty health food stores and co-operatives were instrumental to bringing organic food to a wider audience.{{citation needed|date=March 2013}} As demand for organic foods continued to increase, high volume sales through mass outlets such as supermarkets rapidly replaced the direct farmer connection.{{citation needed|date=March 2013}} Today, many large corporate farms have an organic division. However, for supermarket consumers, food production is not easily observable, and product labeling, like "certified organic," is relied upon. Government regulations and third-party inspectors are looked to for assurance.{{citation needed|date=March 2013}}

In the 1970s, interest in organic food grew with the publication of [[Silent Spring]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Paull|first1=John|title=The Rachel Carson Letters and the  Making of Silent Spring|url=http://orgprints.org/22934/7/22934.pdf|publisher=SAGE|accessdate=20 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the rise of the [[environmental movement]], and was also spurred by food-related health scares like the concerns about [[Daminozide|Alar]] that arose in the mid-1980s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Pollan|first1=Michael|title=The Omnivore's Dilemma: A Natural History of Four Meals|date=2006|publisher=The Penguin Press|location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{See also|List of countries with organic agriculture regulation}}

Organic food production is a self-regulated industry with government oversight in some countries, distinct from [[Kitchen garden|private gardening]]. Currently, the European Union, the United States, Canada, Japan, and many other countries require producers to obtain [[Organic certification|special certification]] based on government-defined standards in order to market food as organic within their borders. In the context of these regulations, foods marketed as organic are produced in a way that complies with organic standards set by national governments and international organic industry trade organizations.

In the United States, organic production is managed in accordance with the [[Organic Foods Production Act of 1990]] (OFPA) and regulations in Title 7, Part 205 of the Code of Federal Regulations to respond to site-specific conditions by integrating cultural, biological, and mechanical practices that foster cycling of resources, promote ecological balance, and conserve biodiversity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ams.usda.gov/AMSv1.0/nop |title=Agricultural Marketing Service – National Organic Program |publisher=Ams.usda.gov |date=2008-10-31 |accessdate=2012-09-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; If livestock are involved, the livestock must be reared with regular access to pasture and without the routine use of antibiotics or [[Bovine somatotropin|growth hormones]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ams.usda.gov/AMSv1.0/getfile?dDocName=STELPRDC5082653&amp;acct=noprulemaking|title=Access to Pasture Rule for Organic Livestock|publisher=Ams.usda.gov|accessdate=2012-09-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Processed organic food usually contains only organic ingredients. If non-organic ingredients are present, at least a certain percentage of the food's total plant and animal ingredients must be organic (95% in the United States,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ams.usda.gov/AMSv1.0/getfile?dDocName=STELDEV3004323&amp;acct=nopgeninfo |title=Labeling: Preamble |accessdate=2012-09-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; Canada, and Australia).  Foods claiming to be organic must be free of artificial [[food additives]], and are often processed with fewer artificial methods, materials and conditions, such as [[SmartFresh|chemical ripening]], [[food irradiation]], and [[genetically modified]] ingredients.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|editors=Allen, Gary J. &amp; Albala, Ken|title=The Business of Food: Encyclopedia of the Food and Drink Industries|publisher=ABC-CLIO|year=2007|isbn=978-0-313-33725-3|page=288|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=gNzmOUyiFRAC&amp;pg=PA288}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Pesticides are allowed as long as they are not synthetic.&lt;ref&gt;Staff, National Pesticide Information Center [http://npic.orst.edu/ingred/organic.html Organic Pesticide Ingredients]&lt;/ref&gt;  However, under US federal organic standards, if pests and weeds are not controllable through management practices, nor via organic pesticides and herbicides, "a substance included on the National List of synthetic substances allowed for use in organic crop production may be applied to prevent, suppress, or control pests, weeds, or diseases."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ecfr.gov/cgi-bin/text-idx?c=ecfr&amp;SID=622a69a51febf44818ad4c8d3535378f&amp;rgn=div8&amp;view=text&amp;node=7:3.1.1.9.32.3.354.7&amp;idno=7|title=eCFR — Code of Federal Regulations|author=|date=|website=www.ecfr.gov}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Several groups have called for organic standards to prohibit [[nanotechnology]] on the basis of the [[precautionary principle]]&lt;ref name="Paull"&gt;Paull, J. &amp; Lyons, K.

In the United States, there are four different levels or categories for organic labeling. 1)‘100%’ Organic: This means that all ingredients are produced organically. It also may have the USDA seal. 2)‘Organic’: At least 95% or more of the ingredients are organic. 3)’Made With Organic Ingredients': Contains at least 70% organic ingredients. 4)‘Less Than 70% Organic Ingredients’: Three of the organic ingredients must be listed under the ingredient section of the label.&lt;ref&gt;"USDA organic: what qualifies as organic?"

Some foods, such as bananas, are picked when unripe, are cooled to prevent ripening while they are shipped to market, and then are induced to ripen quickly by exposing them to [[propylene]] or [[ethylene]], chemicals produced by plants to induce their own ripening; as flavor and texture changes during ripening, this process may affect those qualities of the treated fruit.&lt;ref&gt;Washington State University Extension Office.

[[File:Sign at the Sonoma Farmers market - Stierch.jpg|thumb|upright|Organic vegetables at a farmers' market]]
With respect to chemical differences in the composition of organically grown food compared with conventionally grown food, studies have examined differences in [[nutrients]], [[antinutrients]], and [[pesticide]] residues.&lt;ref name=baranski2017/&gt; These studies generally suffer from [[confounding]] variables, and are difficult to generalize due to differences in the tests that were done, the methods of testing, and because the vagaries of agriculture affect the chemical composition of food;&lt;ref name=baranski2017/&gt; these variables include variations in weather (season to season as well as place to place); crop treatments (fertilizer, pesticide, etc.); soil composition; the cultivar used, and in the case of meat and dairy products, the parallel variables in animal production.&lt;ref name=2014meta/&gt;&lt;ref name=Smith-Spangler2012/&gt;  Treatment of the foodstuffs after initial gathering (whether milk is pasteurized or raw), the length of time between harvest and analysis, as well as conditions of transport and storage, also affect the chemical composition of a given item of food.&lt;ref name=2014meta/&gt;&lt;ref name=Smith-Spangler2012/&gt; Additionally, there is evidence that organic produce is drier than conventionally grown produce; a higher content in any chemical category may be explained by higher concentration rather than in absolute amounts.&lt;ref name=Blair1/&gt;{{page needed|date=May 2015}}

Many people believe that organic foods have higher content of nutrients and thus are healthier than conventionally produced foods.&lt;ref name="reuters"&gt;{{cite web|title=Organic Food No More Nutritious than Non-organic: Study|publisher=Reuters Health|author=Genevra Pittman|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-organic-idUSBRE88303620120904|date=4 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, scientists have not been equally convinced that this is the case as the research conducted in the field has not shown consistent results.

A 2009 systematic review found that organically produced foodstuffs are not richer in vitamins and minerals than conventionally produced foodstuffs.&lt;ref name="Smith-Spangler2012" /&gt; The results of the systematic review only showed a lower nitrogen and higher phosphorus content in organic produced compared to conventionally grown foodstuffs. Content of vitamin C, calcium, potassium, total soluble solids, copper, iron, nitrates, manganese, and sodium did not differ between the two categories.&lt;ref name=reuters/&gt;

A 2012 survey of the scientific literature did not find significant differences in the vitamin content of organic and conventional plant or animal products, and found that results varied from study to study.&lt;ref name=Smith-Spangler2012/&gt; Produce studies reported on [[ascorbic acid]] ([[vitamin C]]) (31 studies), [[beta-carotene]] (a precursor for [[vitamin A]]) (12 studies), and [[alpha-tocopherol]] (a form of [[vitamin E]]) (5 studies) content;  milk studies reported on beta-carotene (4 studies) and alpha-tocopherol levels (4 studies). Few studies examined vitamin content in meats, but these found no difference in beta-carotene in beef, alpha-tocopherol in pork or beef, or vitamin A (retinol) in beef. The authors analyzed 11 other nutrients reported in studies of produce. A 2011 literature review found that organic foods had a higher micronutrient content overall than conventionally produced foods.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hunter|first1=Duncan|last2=Foster|first2=Meika|last3=McArthur|first3=Jennifer O.|last4=Ojha|first4=Rachel|last5=Petocz|first5=Peter|last6=Samman|first6=Samir|title=Evaluation of the Micronutrient Composition of Plant Foods Produced by Organic and Conventional Agricultural Methods|journal=Critical Reviews in Food Science and Nutrition|date=July 2011|volume=51|issue=6|pages=571–582|doi=10.1080/10408391003721701|pmid=21929333}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Similarly, organic chicken contained higher levels of [[omega-3 fatty acid]]s{{Citation needed|date=September 2018|reason=Not in references}} than conventional chicken. The authors found no difference in the protein or fat content of organic and conventional raw milk.&lt;ref name=Magkos2003&gt;{{cite journal|pmid=12907407|year=2003|author1=Magkos|first1=F|title=Organic food: Nutritious food or food for thought?

A 2016 systematic review and meta-analysis found that organic meat had comparable or slightly lower levels of [[saturated fat]] and [[monounsaturated fat]] as conventional meat, but higher levels of both overall and n-3 [[polyunsaturated fatty acid]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Średnicka-Tober|first1=D|last2=Barański|first2=M|last3=Seal|first3=C|last4=Sanderson|first4=R|last5=Benbrook|first5=C|last6=Steinshamn|first6=H|last7=Gromadzka-Ostrowska|first7=J|last8=Rembiałkowska|first8=E|last9=Skwarło-Sońta|first9=K|last10=Eyre|first10=M|last11=Cozzi|first11=G|last12=Krogh Larsen|first12=M|last13=Jordon|first13=T|last14=Niggli|first14=U|last15=Sakowski|first15=T|last16=Calder|first16=PC|last17=Burdge|first17=GC|last18=Sotiraki|first18=S|last19=Stefanakis|first19=A|last20=Yolcu|first20=H|last21=Stergiadis|first21=S|last22=Chatzidimitriou|first22=E|last23=Butler|first23=G|last24=Stewart|first24=G|last25=Leifert|first25=C|title=Composition differences between organic and conventional meat: a systematic literature review and meta-analysis|journal=The British Journal of Nutrition|date=March 2016|volume=115|issue=6|pages=994–1011|doi=10.1017/S0007114515005073|pmid=26878675|pmc=4838835}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another meta-analysis published the same year found no significant differences in levels of saturated and monounsaturated fat between organic and conventional milk,  but significantly higher levels of overall and n-3 [[polyunsaturated fatty acid]]s in organic milk than in conventional milk.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Średnicka-Tober|first1=D|last2=Barański|first2=M|last3=Seal|first3=CJ|last4=Sanderson|first4=R|last5=Benbrook|first5=C|last6=Steinshamn|first6=H|last7=Gromadzka-Ostrowska|first7=J|last8=Rembiałkowska|first8=E|last9=Skwarło-Sońta|first9=K|last10=Eyre|first10=M|last11=Cozzi|first11=G|last12=Larsen|first12=MK|last13=Jordon|first13=T|last14=Niggli|first14=U|last15=Sakowski|first15=T|last16=Calder|first16=PC|last17=Burdge|first17=GC|last18=Sotiraki|first18=S|last19=Stefanakis|first19=A|last20=Stergiadis|first20=S|last21=Yolcu|first21=H|last22=Chatzidimitriou|first22=E|last23=Butler|first23=G|last24=Stewart|first24=G|last25=Leifert|first25=C|title=Higher PUFA and n-3 PUFA, conjugated linoleic acid, α-tocopherol and iron, but lower iodine and selenium concentrations in organic milk: a systematic literature review and meta- and redundancy analyses|journal=British Journal of Nutrition|date=March 2016|volume=115|issue=6|pages=1043–60|doi=10.1017/S0007114516000349|pmid=26878105|pmc=4838834}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Anti-nutrients===
The amount of [[nitrogen]] content in certain vegetables, especially green [[leafy vegetables]] and [[tuber]]s, has been found to be lower when grown organically as compared to conventionally.&lt;ref name=MagkosSafety2006 /&gt;  When evaluating environmental toxins such as [[Heavy metal (chemistry)|heavy metals]], the USDA has noted that organically raised [[chicken]] may have lower [[arsenic]] levels.&lt;ref name=USDA /&gt; Early literature reviews found no significant evidence that levels of arsenic, [[cadmium]] or other heavy metals differed significantly between organic and conventional food products.&lt;ref name=Blair1/&gt;{{page needed|date=May 2015}}&lt;ref name=MagkosSafety2006 /&gt; However, a 2014 review found lower concentrations of cadmium, particularly in organically grown grains.&lt;ref name=2014meta/&gt;

===Phytochemicals===
A 2014 meta-analysis of 343 studies on [[phytochemical]] composition found that organically grown crops had lower [[cadmium]] and pesticide residues, and 17% higher concentrations of [[polyphenols]] than conventionally grown crops.&lt;ref name="2014meta"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Barański|first1=M|last2=Srednicka-Tober|first2=D|last3=Volakakis|first3=N|last4=Seal|first4=C|last5=Sanderson|first5=R|last6=Stewart|first6=GB|last7=Benbrook|first7=C|last8=Biavati|first8=B|last9=Markellou|first9=E|last10=Giotis|first10=C|last11=Gromadzka-Ostrowska|first11=J|last12=Rembiałkowska|first12=E|last13=Skwarło-Sońta|first13=K|last14=Tahvonen|first14=R|last15=Janovská|first15=D|last16=Niggli|first16=U|last17=Nicot|first17=P|last18=Leifert|first18=C|title=Higher antioxidant and lower cadmium concentrations and lower incidence of pesticide residues in organically grown crops: a systematic literature review and meta-analyses|journal=The British Journal of Nutrition|year=2014|pages=1–18|pmid=24968103|doi=10.1017/S0007114514001366|volume=112|issue=5|pmc=4141693}}&lt;/ref&gt; Concentrations of [[phenolic acids]], [[flavanones]], [[stilbenes]], [[flavones]], [[flavonols]], and [[anthocyanins]] were elevated, with [[flavanones]] being 69% higher.&lt;ref name=2014meta/&gt; Studies on phytochemical composition of organic crops have numerous deficiencies, including absence of standardized measurements and poor reporting on measures of variability, duplicate or selective reporting of data, publication bias, lack of rigor in studies comparing pesticide residue levels in organic and conventional crops, the geographical origin of samples, and inconsistency of farming and post-harvest methods.&lt;ref name=2014meta/&gt;&lt;ref name="Smith-Spangler2012" /&gt;

===Pesticide residues===
{{main|Pesticide residue}}
The amount of pesticides that remain in or on food is called pesticide residue. In the United States, before a pesticide can be used on a food crop, the U.S. [[Environmental Protection Agency]] must determine whether that pesticide can be used without posing a risk to human health.&lt;ref&gt;"Pesticides Health and Safety Information." National Pesticides Information Center. National Pesticides Information Center, 1 Apr.2014.Web.9 Nov.2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2012 meta-analysis determined that detectable pesticide residues were found in 7% of organic produce samples and 38% of conventional produce samples. This result was statistically heterogeneous, potentially because of the variable level of detection used among these studies.  Only three studies reported the prevalence of contamination exceeding maximum allowed limits; all were from the European Union.&lt;ref name=Smith-Spangler2012/&gt; A 2014 meta-analysis found that conventionally grown produce was four times more likely to have pesticide residue than organically grown crops.&lt;ref name=2014meta/&gt;

The [[American Cancer Society]] has stated that no evidence exists that the small amount of pesticide residue found on conventional foods will increase the risk of cancer, although it recommends thoroughly washing fruits and vegetables. They have also stated that there is no research to show that organic food reduces cancer risk compared to foods grown with conventional farming methods.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cancer.org/healthy/eathealthygetactive/acsguidelinesonnutritionphysicalactivityforcancerprevention/acs-guidelines-on-nutrition-and-physical-activity-for-cancer-prevention-diet-cancer-questions |title=Common questions about diet and cancer |publisher=Cancer.org |accessdate=2014-06-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Environmental Protection Agency maintains strict guidelines on the regulation of pesticides by setting a tolerance on the amount of pesticide residue allowed to be in or on any particular food.&lt;ref&gt;2013 November, "The ruling on organic foods: are they worth the extra price?" "Healthy Years" ISSN 1551-4617, 11/2013, Volume 10, Issue 11, p. 1&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.epa.gov/pesticides/food/viewtols.htm|title=Pesticides and Food: What the Pesticide Residue Limits are on Food|publisher=US Environmental Protection Agency|date=20 October 2014|accessdate=28 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Although some residue may remain at the time of harvest, residue tend to decline as the pesticide breaks down over time. In addition, as the commodities are washed and processed prior to sale, the residues often diminish further.

===Bacterial contamination===
A 2012 [[meta-analysis]] determined that prevalence of ''[[E. coli]]'' contamination was not [[statistically significant]] (7% in organic produce and 6% in conventional produce). While bacterial contamination is common among both organic and conventional animal products, differences in the prevalence of bacterial contamination between organic and conventional animal products were also statistically insignificant.&lt;ref name=Smith-Spangler2012/&gt;

==Organic meat production requirements==

===United States===
Organic meat certification in the United States requires farm animals to be raised according to USDA organic regulations throughout their lives. These regulations require that livestock are fed certified organic food that contains no animal byproducts.&lt;ref name="usda"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ams.usda.gov/AMSv1.0/getfile?dDocName=STELPRDC5102526 |title=Organic Livestock Requirements |publisher=United States Department of Agriculture |date=July 2013 |accessdate=2014-06-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; Further, organic farm animals can receive no [[growth hormones]] or [[antibiotics]], and they must be raised using techniques that protect native species and other natural resources. [[Irradiation]] and [[genetic engineering]] are not allowed with organic animal production.&lt;ref name="usda"/&gt;&lt;ref name="usda.gov"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://usda.gov/wps/portal/usda/usdahome?parentnav=FAQS_BYTOPIC&amp;FAQ_NAVIGATION_ID=ORGANIC_FQ&amp;FAQ_NAVIGATION_TYPE=FAQS_BYTOPIC&amp;contentid=faqdetail-3.xml&amp;edeployment_action=retrievecontent |title=How does USDA define the term organic? &amp;#124; USDA |publisher=Usda.gov |date=2004-06-24 |accessdate=2014-06-17 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151009091219/http://www.usda.gov/wps/portal/usda/usdahome?parentnav=FAQS_BYTOPIC&amp;FAQ_NAVIGATION_ID=ORGANIC_FQ&amp;FAQ_NAVIGATION_TYPE=FAQS_BYTOPIC&amp;contentid=faqdetail-3.xml&amp;edeployment_action=retrievecontent |archive-date=2015-10-09 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.centerforfoodsafety.org/issues/1050/sewage-sludge/how-do-i-know-if-my-food-was-grown-in-sewage-sludge# |title=Issues &amp;#124; Sewage Sludge &amp;#124; How Do I Know if My Food was Grown in Sewage Sludge? |publisher=Center for Food Safety |accessdate=2014-06-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; One of the major differences in organic animal husbandry protocol is the "pasture rule":&lt;ref name="usda"/&gt; minimum requirements for time on pasture do vary somewhat by species and between the certifying agencies, but the common theme is to require as much time on pasture as possible and reasonable.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=All differences in one table by EU regulation|url=http://organicrules.org/custom/differences.php?id=2g|publisher=ICROFS|accessdate=20 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Access to pasture|url=http://www.ams.usda.gov/AMSv1.0/nopaccesstopasture|publisher=USDA|accessdate=20 August 2014|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140822005418/http://www.ams.usda.gov/AMSv1.0/nopaccesstopasture|archivedate=22 August 2014|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Health and safety==

There is little scientific evidence of benefit or harm to human health from a diet high in organic food, and conducting any sort of rigorous experiment on the subject is very difficult. A 2012 meta-analysis noted that "there have been no long-term studies of health outcomes of populations consuming predominantly organic versus conventionally produced food controlling for socioeconomic factors; such studies would be expensive to conduct."&lt;ref name=Smith-Spangler2012/&gt;  A 2009 meta-analysis noted that "most of the included articles did not study direct human health outcomes. In ten of the included studies (83%), a primary outcome was the change in antioxidant activity. Antioxidant status and activity are useful biomarkers but do not directly equate to a health outcome. Of the remaining two articles, one recorded proxy-reported measures of atopic manifestations as its primary health outcome, whereas the other article examined the fatty acid composition of breast milk and implied possible health benefits for infants from the consumption of different amounts of conjugated linoleic acids from breast milk."&lt;ref name=Dangour2009 /&gt;  In addition, as discussed above, difficulties in accurately and meaningfully measuring chemical differences between organic and conventional food make it difficult to extrapolate health recommendations based solely on chemical analysis.

As of 2012, the scientific consensus is that while "consumers may choose to buy organic fruit, vegetables and meat because they believe them to be more nutritious than other food.... the balance of current scientific evidence does not support this view."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Food Standards Agency's Current Stance|url=http://extras.timesonline.co.uk/organicfood2.pdf|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100331234955/http://extras.timesonline.co.uk/organicfood2.pdf|archivedate=March 31, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The evidence of beneficial health effects of organic food consumption is scarce, which has led researchers to call for more long-term studies.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Hurtado-Barroso |first=Sara |last2=Tresserra-Rimbau |first2=Anna |last3=Vallverdú-Queralt |first3=Anna |last4=Lamuela-Raventós |first4=Rosa María |date=2017-11-30 |title=Organic food and the impact on human health |journal=Critical Reviews in Food Science and Nutrition |pages=1–11 |doi=10.1080/10408398.2017.1394815 |issn=1549-7852 |pmid=29190113}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, studies that suggest that organic foods may be healthier than conventional foods face significant methodological challenges, such as the correlation between organic food consumption and factors known to promote a healthy lifestyle.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Brantsæter |first=Anne Lise |last2=Ydersbond |first2=Trond A. |last3=Hoppin |first3=Jane A. |last4=Haugen |first4=Margaretha |last5=Meltzer |first5=Helle Margrete |date=2017-03-20 |title=Organic Food in the Diet: Exposure and Health Implications|journal=Annual Review of Public Health |volume=38 |pages=295–313 |doi=10.1146/annurev-publhealth-031816-044437 |issn=1545-2093 |pmid=27992727}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Mie |first=Axel |last2=Andersen |first2=Helle Raun |last3=Gunnarsson |first3=Stefan |last4=Kahl |first4=Johannes |last5=Kesse-Guyot |first5=Emmanuelle |last6=Rembiałkowska |first6=Ewa |last7=Quaglio |first7=Gianluca |last8=Grandjean |first8=Philippe |date=2017-10-27 |title=Human health implications of organic food and organic agriculture: a comprehensive review |journal=Environmental Health: A Global Access Science Source |volume=16 |issue=1 |pages=111 |doi=10.1186/s12940-017-0315-4 |issn=1476-069X |pmc=5658984 |pmid=29073935}}&lt;/ref&gt; When the [[American Academy of Pediatrics]] reviewed the literature on organic foods in 2012, they found that "current evidence does not support any meaningful nutritional benefits or deficits from eating organic compared with conventionally grown foods, and there are no well-powered human studies that directly demonstrate health benefits or disease protection as a result of consuming an organic diet."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Forman |first=Joel |last2=Silverstein |first2=Janet |last3=Committee on Nutrition |last4=Council on Environmental Health |last5=American Academy of Pediatrics |date=November 2012 |title=Organic foods: health and environmental advantages and disadvantages |journal=Pediatrics |volume=130 |issue=5 |pages=e1406–1415 |doi=10.1542/peds.2012-2579 |issn=1098-4275 |pmid=23090335}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Consumer safety===

====Pesticide exposure====
The main difference between organic and conventional food products are the chemicals involved during production and processing. The residues of those chemicals in food products have dubious effects on human health. All food products on the market including those that contain residues of pesticides, antibiotics, growth hormones and other types of chemicals that are used during production and processing are said to be safe.&lt;ref&gt;"Organic Food No More Nutritious than Non-organic: Study. Organic Food No More Nutritious than Non-organic: Study, 4 Sept.2012.Web.9 Nov.2015&lt;/ref&gt;

Claims of improved safety of organic food has largely focused on [[pesticide residue]]s.&lt;ref name=MagkosSafety2006 /&gt;  These concerns are driven by the facts that "(1) acute, massive exposure to pesticides can cause significant adverse health effects;
(2) food products have occasionally been contaminated with pesticides, which can result in acute toxicity; and (3) most, if not all, commercially purchased food contains trace amounts of agricultural pesticides."&lt;ref name=MagkosSafety2006 /&gt;  However, as is frequently noted in the scientific literature: "What does not follow from this, however, is that chronic exposure to the trace amounts of pesticides found in food results in demonstrable toxicity. This possibility is practically impossible to study and quantify;" therefore firm conclusions about the relative safety of organic foods have been hampered by the difficulty in proper [[study design]] and relatively small number of studies directly comparing organic food to conventional food.&lt;ref name=Blair1/&gt;&lt;ref name=MagkosSafety2006 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Bourn /&gt;&lt;ref name=Canavari2009/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Rosen|first=Joseph D.|title=A Review of the Nutrition Claims Made by Proponents of Organic Food|journal=Comprehensive Reviews in Food Science and Food Safety|date=May 2010|volume=9|issue=3|pages=270–277|doi=10.1111/j.1541-4337.2010.00108.x }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Additionally, the Carcinogenic Potency Project,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://potency.berkeley.edu/index.html|title=The Carcinogenic Potency Project (CPDB)|author=|date=|website=potency.berkeley.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt; which is a part of the US [[EPA]]'s Distributed Structure-Searchable Toxicity (DSSTox) Database Network,&lt;ref&gt;National Center for Computational Toxicology (NCCT) [http://www.epa.gov/ncct/dsstox/ DSSTox Official Website]&lt;/ref&gt; has been systemically testing the carcinogenicity of chemicals, both natural and synthetic, and building a publicly available database of the results&lt;ref&gt;[http://toxnet.nlm.nih.gov/html/cpdbfs.htm Publicly available Toxnet database from US NLM] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130218135909/http://toxnet.nlm.nih.gov/html/cpdbfs.htm |date=2013-02-18 }}&lt;/ref&gt; for the past ~30 years.  Their work attempts to fill in the gaps in our scientific knowledge of the carcinogenicity of all chemicals, both natural and synthetic, as the scientists conducting the Project described in the journal, ''[[Science (journal)|Science]]'', in 1992: &lt;blockquote&gt;Toxicological examination of synthetic chemicals, without similar examination of chemicals that occur naturally, has resulted in an imbalance in both the data on and the perception of chemical carcinogens. Three points that we have discussed indicate that comparisons should be made with natural as well as synthetic chemicals.&lt;br&gt;
1) The vast proportion of chemicals that humans are exposed to occur naturally. Nevertheless, the public tends to view chemicals as only synthetic and to think of synthetic chemicals as toxic despite the fact that every natural chemical is also toxic at some dose. The daily average exposure of Americans to burnt material in the diet is ~2000 mg, and exposure to natural pesticides (the chemicals that plants produce to defend themselves) is ~1500 mg. In comparison, the total daily exposure to all synthetic pesticide residues combined is ~0.09 mg. Thus, we estimate that 99.99% of the pesticides humans ingest are natural. Despite this enormously greater exposure to natural chemicals, 79% (378 out of 479) of the chemicals tested for carcinogenicity in both rats and mice are synthetic (that is, do not occur naturally). &lt;br&gt;
2) It has often been wrongly assumed that humans have evolved defenses against the natural chemicals in our diet but not against the synthetic chemicals. However, defenses that animals have evolved are mostly general rather than specific for particular chemicals; moreover, defenses are generally inducible and therefore protect well from low doses of both synthetic and natural chemicals.&lt;br&gt;
3) Because the toxicology of natural and synthetic chemicals is similar, one expects (and finds) a similar positivity rate for carcinogenicity among synthetic and natural chemicals. The positivity rate among chemicals tested in rats and mice is ~50%. Therefore, because humans are exposed to so many more natural than synthetic chemicals (by weight and by number), humans are exposed to an enormous background of rodent carcinogens, as defined by high-dose tests on rodents. We have shown that even though only a tiny proportion of natural pesticides in plant foods have been tested, the 29 that are rodent carcinogens among the 57 tested, occur in more than 50 common plant foods. It is probable that almost every fruit and vegetable in the supermarket contains natural pesticides that are rodent carcinogens.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Gold L.S.| year = 1992 | title = Rodent carcinogens: Setting priorities | url = http://toxnet.nlm.nih.gov/cpdb/pdfs/Science1992.pdf | format = PDF | journal = Science | volume = 258 | issue = 5080| pages = 261–265 | doi=10.1126/science.1411524|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

A study published by the [[United States National Research Council|National Research Council]] in 1993 determined that for infants and children, the major source of exposure to pesticides is through diet.&lt;ref&gt;National Research Council.

Much of its production of organic food is exported and not enough organic food is available on the national market to satisfy the rapidly increasing demand.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://consumers.unian.net/ukr/detail/2041|title=В Україні зростає попит на органічні продукти|author=|date=|website=unian.net}}&lt;/ref&gt; The size of the internal market demand for organic products in Ukraine was estimated at over 5 billion euros in 2011, with rapid growth projected for this segment in the future.&lt;ref name="Федерація органічного руху України"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://organic.com.ua/|title=Федерація органічного руху України|author=|date=|website=organic.com.ua}}&lt;/ref&gt; Multiple surveys show that the majority of the population of Ukraine is willing to pay more to buy organic food.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rbc.ua/ukr/finance/show/bolshinstvo-potrebiteley-zhelayut-pokupat-bolee-dorogie-13092010114400|title=Більшість споживачів бажають купувати більш дорогі екологічно чисті товари, - експерти|first=|last=Rbc.ua|date=|website=rbc.ua}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.inrisedevelopment.com/data/research/2010/0912/ Исследование трендов: Готовы ли украинцы покупать экологически чистые товары? // дослідницький центр компанії ''INRISE Development'', вересень 2010&amp;nbsp;р.{{ref-uk}}] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130530130935/http://www.inrisedevelopment.com/data/research/2010/0912/ |date=May 30, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; On the other hand, many Ukrainians have traditionally maintained their own [[Kitchen garden|garden plots]], and this may result in underestimation of how much organically produced food is actually consumed in Ukraine.

:*The Law on Organic Production was passed by [[Verkhovna Rada|Ukraine's parliament]] in April 2011, which in addition to traditional demands for certified organic food also banned the use of [[GMO]]s or any products containing GMOs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.organic.com.ua/uk/news/193-2011-04-21-13-12-29|title=Ухвалено Закон України "Про органічне виробництво"!|first=|last=Administrator|date=|website=www.organic.com.ua}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the law was not signed by the President of Ukraine&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.organic.com.ua/uk/news/203-prezydent-vidhylyv-zakon-ukrainy-pro-organichne-vyrobnyctvo|title=Президент відхилив Закон України "Про органічне виробництво"|first=|last=Administrator|date=|website=www.organic.com.ua}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in September 2011 it was repealed by the [[Verkhovna Rada]] itself.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://organic.ua/uk/component/content/article/12-ukrnews/1150-verhovnoju-radoju-ukrainy-zakon-ukrainy-pro-organichne-vyrobnyctvo-vidhyleno|title=Верховною Радою України Закон України "Про органічне виробництво" відхилено|first=Svyatoslav|last=Rymar|date=|website=organic.ua}}&lt;/ref&gt; The new Organic Production Law was adopted by Rada and signed by President Poroshenko in July 2018.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.ukrinform.net/rubric-economy/2508099-poroshenko-signs-law-establishing-basic-principles-and-requirements-for-organic-production.html Poroshenko signs law establishing basic principles and requirements for organic production&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''parting line''',  in industrial casting of [[Molding (process)|molds]], is the border line in which draft angles change direction.  That is, it is the dividing line that splits the core and cavity halves of a molded part.  It is sometimes a starting point for the mold parting surface.  In [[engineering drawing]], parting line is often abbreviated as PL. [[ASME]]'s Y14.8 standard specifies a symbol for parting line.&lt;ref&gt;http://memagazine.asme.org/Articles/2010/march/Expanding_Standard.cfm&lt;/ref&gt; Engineering applications (seals, tight running molded parts) that require precision for shape control, call for removal of [[Flash (manufacturing)|flash]]es. Many [[molders]] will repair or even replace the mold tooling so that the flash is reduced to an acceptable tolerance or eliminated altogether. Secondary operations to remove parting line flash include hand trimming, vibratory tumbling, media blasting and cryogenic deflashing.&lt;ref name="Nitrofreeze"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nitrofreeze.com/services/deflashing/|title=Cryogenic Deflashing for Molded Plastic, Rubber &amp; Silicone|publisher=Nitrofreeze Cryogenic Solutions|accessdate=2014-04-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3390">'''Protected Concerted Activity''' is a legal term used in labor policy to define employee protection against employer retaliation in the [[United States]].  It is a legal principle under the subject of the [[freedom of association]].  The term defines the activities workers may partake in without fear of employer retaliation. In countries where there is relatively robust employee dismissal protection, the protection of protected concerted activity is less of a distinct legal issue. In liberal market societies like the United States, where it is comparatively easy for an employer to fire an employee, the issue of protected concerted activity has become an important employment protection.  

The [[National Labor Relations Act]], the main labor policy governing labor relations in the United States, defines concerted activity in Section 7.  

&lt;blockquote&gt;
Section 7 - Employees shall have the right to self-organization, to form, join, or assist labor organizations, to bargain collectively through representatives of their own choosing, and to engage in other concerted activities for the purpose of collective bargaining or other mutual aid or protection...&lt;ref&gt;Labor Management Relations Act, 29 U.S.C. Sec. 157&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Generally speaking, there is protected concerted activity when two or more employees act together to improve their terms and conditions of employment, although it is (on rare occasions) possible for conduct to be so egregious that it becomes unprotected.&lt;ref&gt;Atlantic Steel, 245 N.L.R.B. 814, 816 (1979).&lt;/ref&gt; Employees have a right to advocate in this manner even where there is no union involved.&lt;ref&gt;Labor Board v. Washington Aluminum Co., 370 U.S. 9, 14 (1962).&lt;/ref&gt;  

At times, protected concerted activity has extended to individual employees; for example, when an employee speaks individually to his or her employer on behalf of him or herself and one or more co-workers about improving workplace conditions. An individual employee who seeks to enforce a collective bargaining agreement will generally be deemed to be engaged in concerted activity.&lt;ref&gt;NLRB v. City Disposal Systems, 465 U.S. 822 (1984).&lt;/ref&gt; On the other hand, an employee who acts as a "whistleblower" may or may not be engaging in concerted activity; if the complaint is entirely individual and the employee has not discussed it with co-workers, it is unlikely to be protected by the National Labor Relations Act (though it may well be protected under some other public policy).&lt;ref&gt;See Meyers Industries, Inc., 281 N.L.R.B. 882 (1986).&lt;/ref&gt;

The Act does not limit the manner, time, or place in which employees can engage in concerted activity. Consequently, in recent years, the General Counsel of the [[National Labor Relations Board]] has often taken the position that employee conversations about common workplace issues which make use of social media such as [[Facebook]] and [[Twitter]] are protected against retaliation.&lt;ref&gt;See [http://mynlrb.nlrb.gov/link/document.aspx/09031d45807d6567 Report of the Acting General Counsel Concerning Social Media Cases] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130224021509/http://mynlrb.nlrb.gov/link/document.aspx/09031d45807d6567 |date=2013-02-24 }}, OM 12-31 (Jan. 24, 2012).&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Purchasing Managers Index.png|thumb|ISM's Purchasing Managers Index 1948–2012]]

'''Purchasing Managers' Indexes''' ('''PMI''') are [[economic indicators]] derived from monthly surveys of private sector companies.

The three principal producers of PMIs are the [[Institute for Supply Management]] (ISM),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.instituteforsupplymanagement.org/news/content.cfm?ItemNumber=28965&amp;navItemNumber=28882|title=ISM Report On Business|author=ISM|date=|website=instituteforsupplymanagement.org|accessdate=3 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; which originated the manufacturing and non-manufacturing metrics and which produces them for the United States, the [[Singapore Institute of Purchasing and Materials Management]] ([[SIPMM]]), which produces the Singapore PMI,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Manufacturing expands for 18th straight month in February but pace of growth slows|url=http://www.businesstimes.com.sg/government-economy/singapore-manufacturing-grows-for-16th-straight-month-in-december-but-pace-shows|publisher=The Straits Times|accessdate=2 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=新加坡2月份PMI下滑0.4点至52.7|url=http://www.zaobao.com.sg/zfinance/realtime/story20180302-839450|publisher=联合早报|accessdate=2 Mar 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Singapore PMI |url=https://sipmm.edu.sg/about-sipmm-academy/singapore-pmi/|publisher=SIPMM Academy|accessdate=11 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Singapore PMI expands 0.3 point to 53 in March |url=http://sbr.com.sg/manufacturing/news/singapore-pmi-expands-03-point-53-in-march|publisher=Singapore Business Review|accessdate=4 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Markit Group]], which produces metrics based on ISM's work for over 30 countries worldwide.

ISM, SIPMM, and Markit Group separately compile Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) surveys on a monthly basis by polling businesses which represent the makeup of the respective business sector. ISM's surveys cover all [[NAICS]] categories. SIPMM survey covers all manufacturing sectors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Singapore manufacturing shows strong signs of broad-based growth|url=http://www.straitstimes.com/business/economy/manufacturing-shows-strong-signs-of-broad-based-growth|publisher=The Straits Times|accessdate=7 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=About SIPMM|url=https://sipmm.org.sg/about/|publisher=Singapore Institute of Purchasing and Materials Management|accessdate=15 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Industrial Real Estate (Singapore)|url=https://www.dbs.com/aics/templatedata/article/industry/data/en/GR/072016/Singapore_Real_Estate_Industrial.xml|publisher=DBS Bank|accessdate=20 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Markit survey covers private sector companies, but not the public sector.

ISM began to produce the report for the United States in 1948.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.instituteforsupplymanagement.org/ISMReport/MfgROB.cfm|title=Manufacturing - Report On Business|author=ISM|date=|website=www.instituteforsupplymanagement.org|accessdate=3 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The surveys are released shortly after the end of the reference period. The actual release dates depend on the sector covered by the survey. Manufacturing data are generally released on the first business day of the month, followed by construction (Markit only) on the second working day, and non-manufacturing/services on the third business day. SIPMM produces the monthly bulletin since 1998 for the Singapore manufacturing sectors, with a focus on the electronics manufacturing sector since 1998.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Key gauge of economic health due for a checkup|url=http://www.asiaone.com/print/News/The%2BBusiness%2BTimes/Story/A1Story20080419-60706.html|publisher=The Business Times|accessdate=19 April 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; The data are released on the second business day of each month.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Singapore's manufacturing activity expanded at a slower rate in April|url=https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/singapore-s-manufacturing-sector-expands-for-17th-straight-month-9922130|publisher=Channel NewsAsia|accessdate=3 Feb 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Singapore's manufacturing PMI falls to 52.7 in February|url=http://www.xinhuanet.com/english/2018-03/02/c_137011888.htm|publisher=Xinhua News|accessdate=3 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Chicago-PMI survey, owned by Deutsche Börse,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.chicagobusiness.com/article/20110627/NEWS01/110629885/chicago-pmi-parent-finds-buyer-in-deutsche-b%C3%B6rse|title=Chicago PMI parent finds buyer in Deutsche Börse|author=|date=|website=chicagobusiness.com|accessdate=3 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; registers manufacturing and non-manufacturing activity in the [[Chicago metropolitan area|Chicago Region]]. Investors value this indicator because the Chicago region somewhat mirrors the United States overall in its distribution of manufacturing and non-manufacturing activity. {{cn|date=October 2015}}

The predominant operator and owner of Purchasing Managers Index series outside the USA is the [[Markit Group]].&lt;ref name="markiteconomics1"/&gt; Markit issue most of their PMIs in partnership with other companies.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.markiteconomics.com/Survey/Page.mvc/PressReleases IHS Markit Press releases]&lt;/ref&gt; SIPMM is the official Purchasing Managers Index series in Singapore.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Singapore's manufacturing activity expanded at a slower rate in April|url=http://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/business/singapore-s-manufacturing-activity-expanded-at-a-slower-rate-in-8811278|publisher=Channel NewsAsia|accessdate=3 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Singapore manufacturing PMI inches up to 50.9 in June|url=http://www.businesstimes.com.sg/government-economy/singapore-manufacturing-pmi-inches-up-to-509-in-june|publisher=The Business Times|accessdate=3 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2002, SIPMM assisted China Federation of Logistics and Purchasing (CFLP) to produce the China Official PMI.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=School that created S’pore’s PMI looking to expand reach overseas|url=http://www.todayonline.com/business/school-created-spores-pmi-looking-expand-reach-overseas|publisher=TODAY|accessdate=11 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

ISM, SIPMM and Markit Purchasing Managers Indices include additional sub indices for manufacturing surveys such as new orders, employment, exports, stocks of raw materials and finished goods, prices of inputs and finished goods.&lt;ref name="markiteconomics1"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.markit.com/product/PMI|title=PMI|author=|date=|website=www.markit.com|accessdate=3 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Formula, calculation, and reading==
PMI data are presented in the form of a [[diffusion index]], which is calculated as follows:&lt;ref name="markiteconomics1"/&gt;

:&lt;math&gt; PMI = (P_1*1) + (P_2*0.5) + (P_3*0) &lt;/math&gt;

where:
*P&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; = Percentage number of answers that reported an improvement.
*P&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; = Percentage number of answers that reported no change.
*P&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; = Percentage number of answers that reported a deterioration.
 
Thus, if 100% of the panel reported an improvement, the index would be 100.0. If 100% reported a deterioration, the index would be zero.  If 100% of the panel saw no change, the index would be 50.0 (P&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; * 0.5).

Therefore, an index reading of 50.0 means that the variable is unchanged, a number over 50.0 indicates an improvement, while anything below 50.0 suggests a decline. An index of 50.0 would arise if either all respondents reported no change or the number of respondents reporting an improvement was matched by the number of respondents reporting a deterioration. The further away from 50.0 the index is, the stronger the change over the month, e.g. a reading of 55.0 points to a more frequently reported increase in a variable than a reading of 52.5.&lt;ref name="markiteconomics1"/&gt; The degree of confidence experienced by respondents reporting an improvement and the degree of concern experienced by respondents reporting a deterioration are not factored into the index.

==Headline Manufacturing PMI==
The headline manufacturing PMI is a composite of five of the survey indices. These are New orders, Output, Employment, Suppliers' delivery times (inverted) and Stocks of purchases. The ISM attributes each of these variables the same weighting when calculating the overall PMI, whereas Markit uses the following weights: New orders (0.3), Output (0.25), Employment (0.2), Suppliers' Delivery Times (0.15), Stocks of purchases (0.1).&lt;ref name="markiteconomics1"/&gt;

==Markit Economics' PMI surveys==

The data for the index are collected through a survey of 400 purchasing managers in the manufacturing sector on five different fields, namely, new orders from customers, speed of supplier deliveries, inventories, order backlogs and employment level. Respondents can report either better, same or worse conditions than previous months. For all these fields the percentage of respondents that reported better conditions than the previous months is calculated. The five percentages are multiplied by a weighing factor (the factors adding to 1) and are added.&lt;ref name="markiteconomics1"/&gt;

===Survey Panels===
[[Purchasing manager]]s form a near ideal survey sample base, having access to information often denied to many other managers. Due to the nature of their job function, it is important that purchasing managers are among the first to know when trading conditions, and therefore company performance, change for the better or worse. Markit therefore uses such executives to produce data on business conditions.&lt;ref name="markiteconomics1"/&gt;

In each country, a panel of purchasing managers is carefully selected by Markit, designed to accurately represent the true structure of the chosen sector of the economy as determined by official data. Generally, value added data are used at two-digit SIC level, with a further breakdown by company size analysis where possible. The survey panels therefore replicate  the actual economy in miniature. A weighting system is also incorporated into the survey database that weights each response by company size and the relative importance of the sector in which that company operates.&lt;ref name="markiteconomics1"/&gt;

Particular effort is made to achieve monthly survey response rates of around 80%, ensuring that an accurate picture of business conditions is recorded over time.&lt;ref name="markiteconomics1"/&gt;

Data are collected in the second half of each month via mail, email, web, fax and phone.&lt;ref name="markiteconomics1"/&gt;

===Questionnaires===
A key feature of the PMI surveys is that they ask only for factual information. They are not surveys of opinions, intentions or expectations and the data therefore represent the closest one can get to “hard data” without asking for actual figures from companies.&lt;ref name="markiteconomics1"/&gt;

Questions asked relate to key variables such as output, new orders, prices and employment. Questions take the form of up/down/same replies. For example, “Is your company’s output higher, the same or lower than one month ago?”&lt;ref name="markiteconomics1"/&gt;

Respondents are asked to take expected seasonal influences into account when considering their replies.&lt;ref name="markiteconomics1"/&gt;
 
For each main survey question, respondents are asked to provide a reason for any change on the previous month, if known. This assists not only the understanding of variable movement but also in the seasonal process when X12 cannot be used.&lt;ref name="markiteconomics1"/&gt;

===Seasonal adjustment===
The seasonal adjustment of PMI survey data is usually calculated using the [[X-12-ARIMA|X12]] statistical programme of adjustment, as used by governmental statistical bodies in many developed countries. However, the X12 programme only produces satisfactory data if five years' historical data are available. In the absence of such a history of data, the PMI survey data are seasonally adjusted using an alternative method (see next paragraph), developed by Markit Economics.&lt;ref name="markiteconomics1"/&gt;
 
This method was initially designed to provide analysts with a guide to the underlying trend in the survey data and should be recognized as a second-best approach to X12. However, past experience in other countries suggests that Markit’s method of seasonal adjustment goes beyond this initial purpose and in fact in many cases outperforms X12 as a guide to comparable official data.&lt;ref name="markiteconomics1"/&gt;

Markit's method involves using reasons cited by responding survey panel member companies for changes in variables, which are then used to ascertain whether a reported increase or decrease in each variable reflects an underlying change in economic conditions or simply a seasonal variation. Seasonal variations may include changes in demand arising from Christmas, Easter or other public holidays. Normal, expected changes in weather are not included. The net balance of companies reporting an improvement in a variable less those reporting a deterioration is then adjusted to allow for the percentages of companies reporting seasonal induced increases or decreases in the variable.&lt;ref name="markiteconomics1"/&gt;

==Other PMI Surveys==
Similar purchasing managers indices are published by the [[Ifo Institute for Economic Research]] in Germany, the Bank of Japan in Japan ([[Tankan]]), the [[Caixin]] China PMI published by [[Markit]] &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.markiteconomics.com/Survey//PressRelease.mvc/693fcbc797da4b1f988cbdcf24b124e2 Caixin China General Services PMI], accessed 25 October 2015&lt;/ref&gt; and the Swedish PMI run by private bank [[Swedbank]].&lt;ref&gt;https://www.swedbank.se/om-swedbank/swedbank-insikt/swedbank-makroanalys/inkopschefsindex-industri/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.silf.se/medlem-i-silf/pmi-inkopschefsindex/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.swedbank.se/om-swedbank/swedbank-insikt/swedbank-makroanalys/inkopschefsindex-industri/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.swedbank.se/om-swedbank/swedbank-insikt/swedbank-makroanalys/&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[PRIX index]] uses a diffusion index methodology based on that of PMIs. However, rather than drawing on purchasing managers, it uses country analysts based in the world's 20 largest oil exporting countries to forecast political events that may affect global oil exports. The PRIX index is updated quarterly and published for free on the internet.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://prixindex.net |title=PRIX}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==
Rinat Akhmetov was born in [[Donetsk]], [[Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic|Ukrainian SSR]] to a working-class family.

Rinat Akhmetov has an older brother, Igor, who also worked as a coal miner but had to resign due to [[Occupational disease|work-related health complications]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fdu.org.ua/en/news/84 Foundation for Development of Ukraine], 18 May 2007, ''Rinat Akhmetov Fights Against TB with Brother's Disease in Memories''. {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110411133255/http://www.fdu.org.ua/en/news/84 |date=11 April 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Akhmetov obtained a [[Bachelor of Arts]] / [[Bachelor of Science|Science]] in Economics from the [[Donetsk National University]]. He graduated in 2001.&lt;ref name=Forbes/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://file.liga.net/person/3.html|title=Ліга.Досье.Ахметов Ринат Леонидович|publisher=|accessdate=9 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Business career==

===Beginnings===
Details regarding Akhmetov's past, how he obtained his wealth after the fall of communism in Ukraine, and the decade between 1985 and 1995 remain controversial.&lt;ref name=kplibel /&gt;&lt;ref name=LIGA /&gt; Akhmetov has stated in interviews that he obtained his wealth by making risky business investments in the first years after the [[collapse of the Soviet Union]],&lt;ref name=LIGA&gt;{{ru icon}}[http://file.liga.net/person/343-rinat-ahmetov.htmlАхметов Ринат Леонидович], Информационно-аналитический центр "ЛІГА"&lt;/ref&gt; and responded to allegations in 2010, denying he has ever inherited any money from [[Akhat Bragin]] or anyone else: "I have earned my first million by trading coal and coke, and spent the money on assets that no one wanted to buy. It was a risk but it was worth it".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.news-ua.com/2010/09/darovannyj-kon-ukrainy/|title=Дарованный конь Украины - NEWS-UA :: Украинские новости|publisher=|accessdate=9 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many publications in Ukraine and other European countries have made claims about Akhmetov's alleged "criminal past", some of which later retracted their statements.&lt;ref name=kplibel /&gt;&lt;ref name="OCCRP" /&gt;&lt;ref name=NZZ2007 /&gt;

In 2005 Akhmetov hired American lawyers [[Akin Gump Strauss Hauer &amp; Feld]], who issued a statement denying that Akhmetov has any ties with the criminal world.&lt;ref name="washingtonexaminer.com" /&gt;

In the 1980s, Akhmetov acted as an assistant to [[Akhat Bragin]], whom law enforcement agencies regarded as a powerful crime boss;&lt;ref name=LIGA /&gt; allegedly in the illegal cloth trading business.&lt;ref name="JilbertoHogenboom2007" /&gt; [[Andrew Wilson (historian)|Andrew Wilson]], a scholar specializing in Ukrainian politics, categorized Akhmetov as an alleged former 'enforcer' and 'leader' of "[Akhat] Bragin's 'Tatar' clan", responsible for the use of "mafia methods to push aside the 'red directors' of the [Industrial Union of the Donbass] (IUD)".&lt;ref name=awilsonUOR&gt;{{cite book|last=Wilson|first=Andrew|title=Ukraine's Orange Revolution|year=2005|publisher=Yale University Press|location=New Haven|isbn=0-300-11290-4|pages=10–11|url=https://books.google.it/books?id=LooNAwAAQBAJ&amp;q=Bragin%27s+%27Tatar%27+clan#v=snippet&amp;q=Bragin's%20'Tatar'%20clan&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; By the early 1990s, Akhmetov began acquiring property in Donetsk allegedly by means of extortion with the assistance of Volodymyr Malyshev, Lieutenant-General of The Head of Ministry of Internal Affairs Department in Donetsk Oblast.&lt;ref name="JilbertoHogenboom2007" /&gt; Malyshev, now a member of Ukraine's Parliament on the committee controlling law enforcement, is accused by Kuzin of using his position to do away with previously existing police records concerning Akhmetov shortly before becoming chief of security for Akhmetov's company.&lt;ref name="OCCRP" /&gt; "In [the 1990s], Akhmetov was very different – he was totally private with no public persona, and was trying to find ways to deal with his 'difficult past'", noted U.S. ambassador [[William B. Taylor Jr.|William Taylor]], citing prominent Ukrainian businessman Serhiy Taruta. Further in that article cited the answer of the spokesperson for Akhmetov addressed to the Kyiv Post: "We don't know whether this phrase is authentic and what it actually means. Although, any accusations of Mr Akhmetov's involvement in criminal structures is slander." &lt;ref name=kpwikisept15 /&gt;

In October 1995, Bragin, president of Shakhtar Donetsk football club, was killed in a mysterious bombing along with six of his bodyguards at the team's stadium during a match.&lt;ref name="kpbragin"&gt;{{cite news|title=Akhat Bragin|url=http://www.kyivpost.com/news/nation/detail/31849/|accessdate=28 October 2010|newspaper=Kyiv Post|date=10 December 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some rumours associate Akhmetov with the death of Bragin.&lt;ref name=awilsonUOR /&gt; Following the assassinations, Akhmetov is said to have "inherited a vast financial empire from Bragin".&lt;ref name="JilbertoHogenboom2007" /&gt;

[[File:Федоренко. baza12 copy.tif|thumb|Akhmetov, Viktor Yanukovych and Viktor Chernomyrdin]]
Akhmetov would head [[Dongorbank]] (formerly Akceptbank) in 1995.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://delo.ua/wiki/Dongorbank-110689/|title=Донгорбанк|publisher=|accessdate=9 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 1999, an official [[Ministry of Internal Affairs (Ukraine)|Ukrainian Ministry of Internal Affairs]] report titled the "Overview of the Most Dangerous Organized Crime Structures in Ukraine" identified Akhmetov as a leader of an organized crime syndicate. The report tied the group to money laundering, financial fraud, and the control of numerous large and fictitious companies.&lt;ref name="OCCRP"&gt;{{cite web|title=OC Prosecutions Rarely Successful In Ukraine|url=http://www.reportingproject.net/occrp/index.php/ccwatch/cc-watch-indepth/182-oc-prosecutions-rarely-successful-in-ukraine|publisher=[[Organized Crime and Corruption Reporting Project]]|date=21 November 2008|accessdate=7 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="MVSdoc"&gt;{{cite book|title=МВС України Головне управління по боротьбі з організованою злочинністю|year=1999|url=http://reportingproject.net/new/REPORTS/Document%20about%20Donetsk%20crime%20group.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; The report also says that the group's activities "have been stopped," and says further that their criminal natures "have not been confirmed".&lt;ref name=OCCRP /&gt;

Released in a [[WikiLeaks]] diplomatic cable, [[Volodymyr Horbulin]], one of Ukraine's most respected policy strategists and former presidential advisor, told the U.S. Ambassador to Ukraine in 2006 that the Party of Regions, which "enjoyed deep pockets, being largely financed by billionaire Donetsk boss Rinat Akhmetov" is partly composed of "pure criminals" and "criminal and anti-democracy figures".&lt;ref name=wikileakgryt&gt;{{cite news|last=Grytsenko|first=Oksana|title=WikiLeaks: Regions Party partly composed of 'criminals' |url=http://www.kyivpost.com/news/politics/detail/121085/|accessdate=24 January 2012|date=23 January 2012|deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120124205400/http://www.kyivpost.com/news/politics/detail/121085/|archivedate=24 January 2012|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a U.S. diplomatic cable dated 3 February 2006, then U.S. Ambassador [[John E. Herbst|John Herbst]] referred to Akhmetov's Party of Regions as "long a haven for Donetsk-based mobsters and oligarchs" and called Akhmetov the "[[Capo di tutti capi|godfather]]" of the Donetsk clan.&lt;ref name=kpwikisept15&gt;{{cite news|last=Rachkevych|first=Mark|title=WikiLeaks: Nation's businessmen tell tales on each other in chats with US ambassadors|url=http://www.kyivpost.com/news/business/bus_general/detail/112933/|accessdate=25 January 2012|newspaper=Kyiv Post|date=15 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Concrete evidence was never officially revealed against him, nor his company. According to Moskal, the [[Ministry of Internal Affairs (Ukraine)|MVS]] investigated all incidents related to missing people in 1990s in Donetsk region, who had any property left, and its current owners, but no connections with Rinat Akhmetov and his entourage were found.&lt;ref name="profil-ua.com" /&gt; Looking back, Moskal concluded that "we had nothing on Akhmetov in 2005".&lt;ref name="profil-ua.com" /&gt; According to political journal's ''Post-Soviet Affairs'', and ''The Nation'', Akhmetov was investigated on murder charges and for his alleged role in organized crime in the Donetsk region.

Akhmetov founded [[SCM Holdings|System Capital Management Group]] (JSC "SCM") in 2000, and has been its [[Sole proprietorship|sole proprietor]] since 2009.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.finance.ua/ru/~/1/0/all/2009/04/08/157075 Finance.ua], 8 April 2009, ''Ахметов сконцентрировал 100% акций СКМ'' (Akhmetov has 100% ownership of SCM).&lt;/ref&gt;  During his career SCM has grown to be one of Ukraine's leading financial and industrial firms&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ethicalcorp.com/content_print.asp?ContentID=5567 "Europe-Special report-Responsible business in Ukraine – From orange revolution to black economy", By Toby Webb] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090107014947/http://www.ethicalcorp.com/content_print.asp?ContentID=5567 |date=7 January 2009 }}, [[Ethical Corporation]], 11 December 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; with assets including over 100 businesses in metals and mining, power generation, banking and insurance, telecommunications, media and real estate; and revenues of around $12.8&amp;nbsp;billion and has assets worth over $22.7&amp;nbsp;billion.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.scmholding.com/en/investor-relations/financials/ System Capital Management], 22 January 2012, ''Key Financials''.&lt;/ref&gt; The largest company in the SCM Group is [[Metinvest|METINVEST]], which is a mining and steel business and is generally agreed to be Ukraine's largest private business and is one of the larger steel businesses in Europe.

SCM has been recognized as a leader of Ukrainian [[corporate social responsibility]] ratings, garnering the top nomination by [[Gvardiya Magazine]]'s rankings of Ukraine's "Socially Responsible Companies" in 2011. SCM had previously won in 2009,&lt;ref&gt;[http://economics.unian.net/rus/detail/9747 Unian], 17 April 2009, ''СКМ стала первой в рейтинге "ГVардия социально ответственных компаний"'' (SCM is top of Gvardiya's list of socially responsible companies).&lt;/ref&gt; and 2010.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.scmholding.com/en/media-centre/news/view/488/ System Capital Management], 20 April 2010, ''SCM Leads Corporate Social Responsibility in Ukraine (Ukrainian National Rating "Gvardiya")''.&lt;/ref&gt;

Akhmetov's business empire has benefited enormously from his access to power.&lt;ref name="Oligarchs" /&gt; Forbes reports that in January 2014, for example, his businesses won 31% of all state tenders.&lt;ref name="Oligarchs"&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-26277970 | title=Ukraine crisis: Oligarchs are Yanukovych's weakest link | publisher=BBC | accessdate=20 February 2014 | date=20 February 2014|quote="Rinat Akhmetov, the main financial backer of the regime and a long-standing ally of President Viktor Yanukovych, was, until recently, a member of parliament. These privileges can yield substantial benefits."}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 2017, after the DPR leadership announced that it would establish external control over all Ukrainian businesses in the republic's responsibility zone, Akhmetov released a statement saying that his businesses in the Donetsk and Lugansk People's Republics (DPR and LPR) would remain under Ukrainian jurisdiction and would not pay taxes to "self-proclaimed LPR and DPR".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://eadaily.com/en/news/2017/03/02/rinat-akhmetov-not-ready-to-withdraw-from-ukrainian-jurisdiction|title=Rinat Akhmetov not ready to withdraw from Ukrainian jurisdiction: EADaily|work=EADaily|access-date=2018-02-19|language=ru}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 2017, a court in Pechersk, Kyiv seized Akhmetov's shares in Ukrtelecom and TriMob, telephony and cellphone companies owned by Akhmetov. The assets seized were part of an investigation into the privatization of Ukrtelecom in 2011 and Akhmetov's ties to Victor Yanukovich, exiled to Russia in 2014. SCM has denied all allegations and issued a statement saying they would defend their ownership rights.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.kyivpost.com/technology/prosecutors-put-hold-akhmetovs-shares-ukrtelecom-trimob.html|title=Prosecutors put hold on Akhmetov's shares in Ukrtelecom, TriMob {{!}} KyivPost|date=2017-04-14|work=KyivPost|access-date=2017-06-18|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; On October 19, 2017, the state ruled that Akhmetov was to return all ownership rights to the state and pay a fine of $82 million for failing to fulfill privatization obligations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.kyivpost.com/technology/court-returns-akhmetovs-ukrtelecom-state-property-oligarch-appeal.html|title=Court returns Akhmetov's Ukrtelecom to state property, oligarch to appeal {{!}} KyivPost|date=2017-10-20|work=KyivPost|access-date=2018-02-19|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; In December 2017, as part of the Ukrtelecom ownership legal battle, a court in Cyprus issued an order to freeze $820 million in assets held by Akhmetov. In January 2018, a Dutch court issued an order, based on the same litigation, to "freeze SCM's Netherlands-registered businesses, which include Ukraine's largest steel company [[Metinvest]] and largest private power and coal producer, [[DTEK]]." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Natalia Zinets|first1=Alessandra Prentice|title=Dutch court orders freeze on Ukraine tycoon's assets|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-ukraine-scm-court/dutch-court-orders-freeze-on-ukraine-tycoons-assets-idUSKBN1EY1MN|accessdate=9 January 2018|agency=Reuters|date=9 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Cypriot Court Orders Freeze of $820 Million In Assets Held By Ukrainian Billionaire|url=https://www.rferl.org/a/ukraine-billionaire-akhmetov-cypriot-court-orders-freeze/28956933.html|accessdate=8 January 2018|agency=Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty|date=5 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 2018 the Ukraine Supreme Economic Court ruled against the renationalization of Ukrtelecom and Akhemtov controls ownership of the company through SCM Holdings.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.kyivpost.com/technology/court-suspends-renationalization-of-ukrtelecom-still-in-hands-of-akmetov.html|title=Court suspends renationalization of Ukrtelecom, still in hands of Akhmetov {{!}} KyivPost|date=2018-06-06|work=KyivPost|access-date=2018-10-03|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In September of the same year Akhmetov was criticized over environmental concerns faced by residents of Mariupol caused by two steel plants, Ilyich Iron and Steel Works Plant and the Azov Stal Steel Plant, both owned by Metinvest.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.kyivpost.com/ukraine-politics/mariupol-breathes-dirtiest-air-in-ukraine-thanks-to-2-akhmetov-steel-plants.html|title=Mariupol breathes dirtiest air in Ukraine thanks to 2 Akhmetov steel plants {{!}} KyivPost|date=2018-09-07|work=KyivPost|access-date=2018-10-03|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Akhmetov has been noted as a financier and unofficial leader of the [[Party of Regions]] political party.&lt;ref name="kpwikisept15"/&gt;&lt;ref name="wikileakgryt"/&gt;

In a 13 September 2007 diplomatic cable released between prominent Ukrainian business partners [[Serhiy Taruta]], [[Vitaliy Haiduk]], and U.S. ambassador [[William B.

In August 2014 Akhmetov's [[Foundation for Development of Ukraine]] also started a new particular project called Humanitarian Aid Drives.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fdu.org.ua/en/humtrip|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150217160321/http://www.fdu.org.ua/en/humtrip|dead-url=yes|archive-date=17 February 2015|title=Humanitarian aid drive|publisher=|accessdate=18 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The purpose of this project is the regular delivery of food and children's packages to Donbass.

Akhmetov also made numerous statements, since March 2014, appealing for integrity of Ukraine and finding peaceful solutions of the crisis.&lt;ref name=APM20514/&gt;&lt;ref name=Akhsd/&gt; He believes [[decentralization]] should be part of this peaceful solution.&lt;ref name=Akhsd&gt;[http://en.interfax.com.ua/news/general/330349.html Akhmetov willing to do anything to stop war in Donbas - press secretary], [[Interfax-Ukraine]] (12 March 2014)&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the mysterious October 1995 bombing assassination of former team president Akhat Bragin at the team's stadium, Akhmetov (who had served as Bragin's right-hand man and himself narrowly missed the attempt on his life),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2009/apr/30/shakhtar-donetsk-dynamo-kyiv-uefa-cup |location=London |work=The Guardian |first=Jonathan |last=Wilson |title=Football: Dynamo Kyiv and Shakhtar Donetsk square up in one of tonight's Uefa Cup semi-finals, writes Jonathan Wilson |date=30 April 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; subsequently inherited operation of the [[FC Shakhtar Donetsk|Shakhtar Donetsk]] football club. On 11 October 1996, Akhmetov was appointed president of the team&lt;ref name="shakhtar.com"&gt;[http://shakhtar.com/en/club/history/?p=7 Shakhtar.com] ''club history 1996–2006''.&lt;/ref&gt; and began investing heavily in both players and their training facilities. Under his command, FC Shakhtar became [[Premier League]] Champions in 2002, 2005, 2006, 2008, 2010, 2011, 2012, 2013, 2014 and 2017; [[Ukrainian Cup|Domestic Cup]] champions in 1997, 2001, 2002, 2004, 2008, 2011, 2012, 2013, 2016 and 2017; Super-Cup in 2005, 2008, 2012, 2013, 2014, 2015 and 2017; and [[UEFA Cup]] in 2009.&lt;ref name="shakhtar.com"/&gt;

In 2009, '''[[Donbass Arena]]''' stadium was built in Donetsk at Rinat Akhmetov's initiative. It is the first stadium in [[Eastern Europe]] that was designed and built to the elite [[UEFA stadium categories|UEFA standards]]; its seating capacity holds over 50,000 persons.&lt;ref&gt;[http://donbass-arena.com/en/arena/char/ Donbass Arena] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110716132449/http://donbass-arena.com/en/arena/char/ |date=16 July 2011 }} ''Facts and figures''.&lt;/ref&gt; Rinat Akhmetov had dreamt about such a stadium long before Ukraine had acquired the right to host [[EURO 2012]].

Due to the [[War in Donbass]] in Ukraine FC Shakhtar moved to [[Kiev]]. Since May, 2014 the team is based in Kiev and plays their home games in [[Lviv]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www1.skysports.com/football/news/11095/9391451/shakhtar-donetsk-will-play-their-home-games-in-the-western-city-of-lviv-due-to-the-ongoing-troubles-in-ukraine|title=Shakhtar Donetsk will play home games in Lviv due to ongoing troubles in Ukraine|publisher=|accessdate=18 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Meanwhile, the club's home stadium [[Donbass Arena]] in August 2014 became a center of humanitarian  aid in Donetsk.

During the 2013-14 [[Euromaidan]] anti-government protests, Akhmetov became a target of protest as he was seen as a symbol of oppression. In December 2013 protesters picketed his residence in [[London]] on several occasions, urging him to cut ties with incumbent president [[Viktor Yanukovych]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.businessweek.com/articles/2013-12-19/ukraines-oligarchs-may-switch-sides-over-abandoned-eu-trade-deal|title=Ukraine's Oligarchs May Switch Sides Over Abandoned EU Trade Deal - Businessweek|author1=Henry Meyer |author2=Kateryna Choursina |author3=Daryna Krasnolutska |work=Businessweek|accessdate=9 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In response, Akhmetov issued a statement condemning police brutality. On December 31, Akhmetov reprimanded a group of protesters in public near his home in Donetsk.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kyivpost.com/content/ukraine/akhmetov-talks-to-protesters-in-donetsk-photo-video-334504.html|title=Akhmetov talks to protesters in Donetsk (PHOTO, VIDEO)|work=Kyiv Post|accessdate=9 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the Euromaidan revolution Akhmetov lost more than half of his wealth. His net value went down from $11.2 billion to $2.9 billion in 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.kyivpost.com/ukraine-politics/rain-shine-guys-always-got-shiny-dime.html|title=Rinat Akhmetov: Too Big To Tame |date=2016-10-20|work=Kyiv Post|access-date=2017-06-18|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; News reports suggest that much of his former wealth has been redistributed to other [[Russian oligarchs]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url= http://www.newstatesman.com/world/2016/02/how-vladimir-putin-lost-ukraine |title= How Vladimir Putin lost Ukraine |website= New Statesman |language=en |access-date= 2017-06-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Disputes in the media===
When dealing with public criticism and allegations concerning his past, Akhmetov has utilized a team of PR consultants and lawyers to protect his image and name. His team often contests reports on him that they consider to be libelous, scandalous, or inaccurate. To date, his legal team has obtained many retractions, apologies, and libel settlements.&lt;ref name=kplibel&gt;{{cite news|last=Lavrov|first=Vlad|title=Libel Warriors|url=http://www.kyivpost.com/news/nation/detail/96887/|accessdate=25 January 2012|newspaper=Kyiv Post|date=11 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Critics accuse Akhmetov of going beyond protecting his name, but rather [[fear mongering]] investigative journalists.&lt;ref name=kplibel /&gt; As many court cases occur in London for its lax free speech laws, critics accuse Akhmetov and his legal team of abuse of [[libel tourism]].&lt;ref name=kplibel /&gt; In January 2008, Akhmetov won a [[London]] libel court case "for damage to his reputation" for such claims,&lt;ref name="OCCRP"/&gt; while several other statements about his "criminal past" have been retracted by the media.

In a statement issued by Akhmetov's lawyer Mark MacDougall, "Akhmetov has done a lot of work to protect his good name from false accusations, which might hurt the reputation of his family and business. As the result of it, many publications in Ukraine and other European countries had published retractions and apologies… [and] admitted that their claims are false. We think that these facts speak for themselves".&lt;ref name="OCCRP"/&gt;

In 2007, the [[Kyiv Post]], the primary [[English language]] [[daily newspaper]] in Ukraine, published an article relating to Mr. Akhmetov's business transactions relating to the Dniproenergo thermoelectric generator and the Kryvorizhstal steel mill.&lt;ref name=KP28428/&gt; The newspaper published an apology stating that "on closer examination, we concluded these allegations{{Clarify|date=January 2012}} relating to Mr. Akhmetov were untrue and have no basis in fact."&lt;ref name=KP28428&gt;[http://www.kyivpost.com/news/opinion/editorial/detail/28428/ Kyiv Post], 21 February 2008, ''Rinat Akhmetov – The Kyiv Post's apology''.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2007, the [[German language]] Swiss newspaper [[Neue Zürcher Zeitung]] ("NZZ") retracted defamatory statements from published earlier article regarding Mr. Akhmetov's early business career in the 1990s, noting that "there is no connection between Akhmetov … and organized crime in Ukraine" and "[t]he economic success of Akhmetov is not based by any means on criminally acquired starting capital."&lt;ref name=NZZ2007&gt;[http://www.thefreelibrary.com/Swiss+Newspaper+Issues+Retraction+of+False+News+Report+and+Apologizes...-a0165338261 The Free Library.com], 21 June 2007, "Swiss newspaper issues retraction of false news report and apologizes to Rinat Akhmetov."&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2008, a judgment was obtained from the [[High Court of Justice]] in London after Obozrevatel, a Ukrainian language Internet publication refused to retract false and libelous statements alleging that Mr. Akhmetov was connected to criminal activity and violence. The Obozrevatel reporter ([[Tetiana Chornovol]])&lt;ref name=KP-Jan12/&gt; interviewed his former classmates and neighbors, and delved into his early years.&lt;ref name=kplibel /&gt;  Following court pressure Obozrevatel issued an official apology stating: "The editorial hereby admits that there was unchecked and false information about Rinat Akhmetov present in the … articles … We hereby give our apologies to Rinat Akhmetov for the problems resulted from the above-mentioned publications."&lt;ref&gt;[http://focus.ua/politics/15389 Фокус (Focus.ua)], 15 January 2008, ''Ахметов выиграл суд у Интернет-издания. Ответчик удивлен'' (Akhmetov wins libel case against internet site. Defendant surprised by verdict.)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://obozrevatel.com/news/2008/11/22/270152.htm Обозреватель (Obozrevatel)], ''Официальное извинение Ринату Ахметову'' (Official apology to Rinat Akhmetov). Obozrevatel agreed to pay $100,000 to a charitable foundation of Akhmetov's choosing as compensation for the false statements Obozrevatel had published on 19 and 26 January 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; Tetiana Chornovol, who has political ambitions, refused to issue an apology or acknowledge any wrongdoing.&lt;ref name=KP-Jan12&gt;[http://www.kyivpost.com/news/nation/detail/120428/ Kyiv Post], January 2012, ''Investigative journalist runs for parliament to fight corruption'', by Oksana Grytsenko.&lt;/ref&gt;

The website GoLocalProv.com, based in [[Providence, Rhode Island]], published in 2010 allegations that Akhmetov had ties to organized crime.&lt;ref name=Polifact23Oct2010/&gt; Subsequently, [[PolitiFact]] engaged in a review of the allegations on GoLocalProv's site and disputed the sources on which they were based, stating that "key elements of the [GoLocalProv] story are false or unproven" and that the story presented "suspicions, suggestions, innuendo, and conspiracy theories" as fact.&lt;ref name=Polifact23Oct2010&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.politifact.com/rhode-island/article/2010/oct/23/website-ignores-key-facts-link-chafee-organized-cr/.|title=Website ignores key facts in bid to tie Lincoln Chafee to organized crime in Ukraine|work=PolitiFact Rhode Island|accessdate=9 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The GoLocalProv articles and audio shortly after their publishing were removed from the site. The publisher, Josh Fenton, explained that they disappeared for "technical reasons" and the radio station which aired the interview containing the allegations refused comment.&lt;ref name=kplibel /&gt;

In 2010, the French daily newspaper [[Le Figaro]] issued a retraction of false allegations it published on 18 January 2010 regarding Rinat Akhmetov, due to a lack of evidence to support their claims, and issued an apology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2010/01/29/idUS10995+29-Jan-2010+PRN20100129 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121022151849/http://www.reuters.com/article/2010/01/29/idUS10995+29-Jan-2010+PRN20100129 |dead-url=yes |archive-date=22 October 2012 |agency=Reuters |title=French Newspaper Issues Apology to Ukrainian Businessman and Political Leader Rinat Akhmetov |date=29 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/french-newspaper-issues-apology-to-ukrainian-businessman-and-political-leader-rinat-akhmetov-82984192.html PR Newswire], 28 January 2010, "French newspaper issues apology to Ukrainian businessman and political leader Rinat Akhmetov".&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=KyivPost29Jan2010&gt;[http://www.kyivpost.com/news/nation/detail/58237/print/ ''Kyiv Post''], 29 January 2010, "French newspaper issues apology to Ukrainian businessman Akhmetov for false report".&lt;/ref&gt;  Le Figaro had claimed that Akhmetov was "a scandalous Ukrainian oligarch" and that he was "a bandit in the past".&lt;ref name=KyivPost29Jan2010/&gt;

In 2013, Akhmetov's legal representatives issued a press release in response to accusations in the media, which cited politicians and journalists, that implicated Akhmetov in the 1996 murder of Donetsk-based Ukrainian oligarch [[Yevhen Shcherban]]. The official statement stated that they "have not found any proof suggesting that Akhmetov was involved in Scherban's or other businessmen's killings. To be honest, some of the businessmen killed in the 1990s were Mr. Akhmetov's close friends."&lt;ref name=jpj2513&gt;{{cite news|last=Interfax-Ukraine|title=Defense: Akhmetov not involved in high-profile murders|url=http://www.kyivpost.com/content/politics/defense-akhmetov-not-involved-in-high-profile-murders-319367.html|accessdate=26 January 2013|newspaper=Kyiv Post|date=25 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6675">'''Senior peer counseling, a.k.a. Peer counseling for seniors,''' provides [[Senior Citizens|senior citizens]] with a trained volunteer counselor to provide assistance with [[emotional support]] and encouragement to those who are experiencing life changes that often accompany [[Ageing|aging]].  Seniors typically use counseling to discover ways to deal with [[grief]], loss, physical limitations, financial issues, mild [[Depression (mood)|depression]], family relationships, [[loneliness]], isolation, housing situations, [[anxiety]], change in [[cognitive function]], and [[Caregiving|care giving]] for a spouse.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Garcia|first=Y.|title=A senior peer counseling program: Evaluation of training and benefits to counselors|journal=Educational Gerontology|date=1997|volume=23 |page=329|issue=4 |doi=10.1080/0360127970230403 |last2=Metha |first2=Arlene |last3=Perfect |first3=Maureen C.|last4=McWhirter|first4=J. Jeffries}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Origin ==

The original idea of Senior Peer Counseling was developed in 1977 by Evelyn Freeman, Ph.D. (1917–2013). She first created a program called Senior Health and Peer Counseling of [[Santa Monica, California]]. In 1986 in collaboration with others, she produced "Peer Counseling for Seniors: A Trainer's Guide".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Mai-Duc|first=Christine|title=Evelyn Freeman dies at 96; therapist was pioneer in aging issues|url=https://a1seniorcare.com/evelyn-freeman-dies-at-96/ |newspaper=Los Angeles Times|date=February 4, 2013}} &lt;/ref&gt;
As a result, various groups utilized her trainer's guide and Senior Peer Counseling programs became available in many California counties as well as in South Carolina, Colorado, Oregon, New Mexico, and Washington. The program is also available in Europe, Canada, and Japan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aaspc-programs.org/storyofspc.html|title=The Story of SPC|publisher=American Association of Senior Peer Counseling|accessdate=August 26, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Sponsorship of the program in those locations comes from county health services, interfaith councils, senior citizen advocacy groups, and non-profit organizations. These Senior Peer Counseling programs vary widely in their methods, and no one program is alike. However, they all operate in the spirit of Evelyn Freeman's vision of Senior Peer Counseling. In addition, even though no two programs are exactly alike, there is an organization called the American Association of Senior Peer Counseling that tries to bring together all of the various Senior Peer Counseling agencies to share opportunities for networking and information.

== Program design characteristics ==

In general, Senior Peer Counseling volunteers are trained to provide one-on-one, (counselor and client) confidential counseling to other persons 50 years of age or older.&lt;ref name="Freeman"&gt;{{cite book|last=Freeman|first=Evelyn|title=Peer Counseling for Seniors:A Trainer's Guide|date=1995|publisher=Senior Health and Peer Counseling|location=Santa Monica, CA}}&lt;/ref&gt; The counseling sessions are [[goal-oriented]] or [[Supportive psychotherapy|supportive]] and are in general one hour per week. The sessions are held in the client's home, a senior citizen center, or another confidential setting&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Grady|first=S.|title=Senior Centers: An Environment for Counseling|journal=Generations: Journal of the American Society on Aging|date=1990|volume=14 |issue=1 |pages=15–18|url=http://www.indiana.edu/~leisure/module2/unit3_LA2/readings/Grady.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; and are closely supervised by professionals, i.e., psychologists, marriage and family therapists, or social workers, who intervene, as appropriate, with suggestions about how to handle situations with clients or to provide resources.&lt;ref name="Freeman"/&gt;
Confidentiality is only broken in exceptional circumstances, such as when there is suspected [[Child abuse|child]] or [[elder abuse]] or when the client reports he or she is at risk of [[suicide]], [[homicide]], or [[grave disability]]. In these events, counselings have specific reporting instructions to assure the safety of everyone concerned.&lt;ref name="Freeman"/&gt;
Referrals to Senior Peer Counseling programs are often made by [[Adult Protective Services]] agencies, [[Home health nursing|home health]] workers, hospitals, [[Social work|social workers]], registered nurses, [[Retirement home|senior housing]], or other agencies serving senior citizens. Elders may become aware of the program through postings in senior citizen centers, senior housing, or other agencies serving senior citizens, and may self-refer into the program.&lt;ref name="Freeman"/&gt;

== Effectiveness ==

Seniors counseling can be effective because the counselors often have had life experiences similar to their clients. In contrast, professional counselors may unintentionally create a power imbalance with older clients unfamiliar with formal counseling and many senior clients will not seek formal counseling due to cost or perceived [[Social stigma|stigma]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Bratter|first=B.|title=The Maturing of Peer Counseling|journal=Generations|date=1990|volume=14 |issue=1 |page=49|url=http://psycnet.apa.org/psycinfo/1990-20670-001}}&lt;/ref&gt; Senior peer counseling programs, therefore, may provide a more comfortable and supportive environment for the client.

In 2010-2011, Applied Survey Research (ASR) conducted a study of 43 senior peer counseling clients in [[San Mateo County, California]]. The study concluded that the clients had discussed personal issues in their lives more often with their senior peer counselors than with anyone else including family, friends, and neighbors. The study also found that 75% of the clients had reported the senior peer counseling had "helped a lot", especially with their concerns about food, health, loneliness, and sadness. Twenty-three percent reported it had "helped a little bit" and 3% reported it "had not helped at all".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Peninsula Family Service Senior Peer Counseling Program: Results of the 2010-2011 Client Survey|url=http://www.appliedsurveyresearch.org/storage/database/health/peninsulafamilyservice/ThePeninsulaFamilyServiceSeniorPeerCounseling.pdf|publisher=Applied Survey Research (ASR)|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141108184355/http://www.appliedsurveyresearch.org/storage/database/health/peninsulafamilyservice/ThePeninsulaFamilyServiceSeniorPeerCounseling.pdf|archivedate=2014-11-08|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2262">'''Service 4.0''' is a collective term for technologies and concepts of service and support function organizations, based on new disruptive technological concepts ([[big data]], [[mobile computing|mobility]]), the [[Internet of Things]] and the [[Internet of Services]]. It is a similar concept to [[industry 4.0]], applied to [[value chain]]. The proponents of Service 4.0 claim that it is a major opportunity for service companies to make a leap forward in terms of efficiency and effectiveness, and an opportunity for service users to discover and benefit from new features, impossible to be delivered before this disruption.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://ec.europa.eu/commission/commissioners/2014-2019/bienkowska/announcements/services-40_en|title=Services 4.0 - European Commission|date=2016-09-06|website=European Commission|language=en|access-date=2017-07-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There is not much literature about Service 4.0.

== Definition of service ==
In economics, a [[Service (economics)|service]] is an intangible commodity, an economic activity where the buyer does not generally, except by exclusive contract, obtain exclusive ownership of the thing purchased.

According to the [[North American Industry Classification System|North American Standard Industry Classification System]] and the International Standard Industrial Classification of All Economic Activities &lt;ref&gt;[http://unstats.un.org/unsd/publication/seriesM/seriesm_4rev4e.pdf International Standard Industrial Classification of All Economic Activities (ISIC) Revision 4], United Nations, New York, 2008&lt;/ref&gt; there are two major sectors in the economy: the goods-producing sector and the service-producing sector. The goods-producing sector includes agriculture, forestry, and fishing; mining; construction; and manufacturing. The service-producing sector includes the divisions of (1) transportation, communications, and utilities; (2) wholesale trade; (3) retail trade; (4) finance, insurance, and real estate; (5) public administration; and (6) services. This sixth group—the services division—includes a number of industries.

[[File:BronzeSprueRisersSideView.jpg|thumb|Bronze casting showing sprue and risers]]

A '''sprue''' is the passage through which liquid material is introduced into a mold. In many cases it controls the flow of material into the mold.  During [[casting]] or [[Molding (process)|molding]], the material in the sprue will solidify and need to be removed from the finished part. This excess material is also called a sprue.

==Casting==
In [[casting]], a sprue is the passage through which a molten material is introduced into a [[molding (process)|mold]], and the term also refers to the excess material which solidifies in the sprue passage.  In [[sand casting]], the sprue is formed by a [[dowel]], which is removed from the sand to make the hole into which the metal is poured.

===Function===
Sprues can serve as filters, as [[heat sink]]s, and as feeders. [[Bronze]], in particular, has a high shrinkage rate as it is cooling; a sprue can continue to provide molten metal to the casting, provided that it is large enough to retain enough heat to stay liquid, as metal in the main casting cools and shrinks. The design of the sprue and runner system can be also used to prevent [[dross]] and sand from continuing into the main cavity; this may include adding porous material to the runners or using [[cyclonic separation]] to move the dross to the side of the sprue.

===Sprue design===
The design of the sprue gating and runner is also essential for casting. The design can incorporate either bottom or vertical gating.

For bottom gating

:&lt;math&gt;t_f = \frac {2 A_m(\sqrt {h_t}-\sqrt {h_t-h_m})} {A_g \sqrt{2g}} &lt;/math&gt;

where:

:&lt;math&gt;t_f&lt;/math&gt;   = Time for filling

:&lt;math&gt;A_m&lt;/math&gt; = Area of mold

:&lt;math&gt;A_g&lt;/math&gt; =  Area of gate

:&lt;math&gt;g&lt;/math&gt;   =  Acceleration due to gravity

:&lt;math&gt;h_t&lt;/math&gt;  = Total height

:&lt;math&gt;h_m&lt;/math&gt; = Height of mold cavity

This equation may change if the height of gating is equal to height of casting material.

Then the equation will be:

:&lt;math&gt;t_f = \frac {2 A_m\sqrt {h_t-(h_t-h_m)}} {A_g \sqrt {2g}} &lt;/math&gt;

or, simplified,

:&lt;math&gt;t_f = \frac {2 A_m\sqrt {h_m}} {A_g \sqrt {2g}} &lt;/math&gt;

where:

:&lt;math&gt;t_f&lt;/math&gt;   = Time for filling

:&lt;math&gt;A_m&lt;/math&gt; = Area of mold

:&lt;math&gt;A_g&lt;/math&gt; =  Area of gate

:&lt;math&gt;g&lt;/math&gt;   =  Acceleration due to gravity

:&lt;math&gt;h_t&lt;/math&gt;  = Total height (Height of gating + height of mold cavity)

:&lt;math&gt;h_m&lt;/math&gt; = Height of mold cavity

==Injection molding==
[[File:Sprue.JPG|thumb|Plastic sprue]]
In [[injection molding]], '''sprue''' refers to the passage through which a liquid material (such as [[polystyrene]] or [[polyvinyl chloride]]) flows into a [[Die (manufacturing)|die]], where the material solidifies to form parts.  ''Sprue'' also refers to the material that solidifies in these passages, forming a framework that attaches the parts in a roughly planar arrangement.

===Sprues, runners, and gates===
Some moldmakers distinguish the sprue, the gate, and the runner. The sprue is a large-diameter channel through which plastic flows, usually around the edges of the part or along straight lines. The runner is a smaller channel from the sprue to the individual part. An analogy may be found in a water system that employs a water main (sprue) and smaller pipes (runners) to individual houses. The gate is the location at which the molten plastic enters the mold cavity and is often evidenced by a small nub or projection (the "gate mark") on the molded piece. 
 
Many [[Scale model|scale-model]] kits are made from injection-molded plastic. Hobbyists typically remove the parts of a model kit from the runner using a sharp [[craft knife]] or [[razor saw]]. The sprues usually form a rectangle with the runners and parts inside which makes them easier to box.

[[Model maker]]s sometimes use sprues or runners as raw material to fabricate additional parts, such as railings on [[model ship]]s, [[Antenna (radio)|antenna]] wires on [[Model airplane|airplanes]], or [[greeble]]s on fictional spacecraft.

Sprues in model kits often include engravings to identify the parts by number.

'''Taito Waradi''' is a [[Fiji]]an [[businessman]] who has served as President of the [[Fiji Chamber of Commerce and Industry]].  He is known as a strong proponent of [[free enterprise]].  He has also been outspoken in his calls for moral values to be upheld in business, politics, and society. On 8 January 2007 he resigned the presidency of the Chamber of Commerce and Industry to take up the position of [[Minister for Commerce (Fiji)|Minister for Commerce]] in the interim [[Cabinet of Fiji|Cabinet]] of [[Commodore (rank)|Commodore]] [[Frank Bainimarama]].

== Business positions ==

On 22 May 2005, Waradi called for the deregulation of the telecommunication market, to allow the market to dictate prices.

== Political positions ==
On 18 May 2005, Waradi spoke out about the Fijian government's controversial proposal to establish a [[Reconciliation, Tolerance, and Unity Bill|Reconciliation and Unity Commission]], with the power to recommend amnesty for perpetrators of the [[2000 Fijian coup d'état|coup d'état]] that rocked Fiji in 2000, as well as compensation for its victims.  Among the strident comments both for and against the proposal, Waradi took a moderate stance, supporting the principle of reconciliation, but considering that legislating to establish the commission was not the right way to achieve it.  He called the proposed legislation a "man-made law" that would not work unless the economic disparity between the races ([[Fijians|indigenous Fijians]] and [[Indians in Fiji|Indo-Fijians]]) was rectified.  He also said that moral values would be essential to the success of the reconciliation process.

Only by integrating indigenous Fijians into the economic life of the country, such as through joint ventures, equities, board memberships, employment, and investment, could the root cause of unrest and instability be addressed, he said.  Economic reconciliation would have to come before social and political reconciliation.

Rather than proceed with the proposed legislation, Waradi said the government should declare a National Conscience Week as a time for individuals and society as a whole to examine their hearts to ascertain where the nation had gone wrong.  This week of reflection should be followed, he said, by a roadmap to achieve true reconciliation, peace, and prosperity.

Waradi also emphasized that without moral values, the reconciliation process would fail. ''"No amount of legislation can guarantee lasting peace and stability if the people it is supposed to serve are not spiritually and emotionally prepared to live by them and where necessary defend them with their lives when it is breached,"'' he said. ''"Basic moral values must therefore first be internalised in the hearts and minds of its people before we can hope to enforce legislation reflecting these values.  We cannot begin to observe man-made laws if we do not have any moral values to start off with in the first place."''  This followed his earlier call on 15 May for social institutions that mould young people, such as churches, to preach and follow moral values.

'''Esther Van Ginderen-Verbeeck''' (8 September 1931, [[Hoboken (Antwerp)|Hoboken]] – 30 January 2018, [[Bonheiden]]), also known as '''Aunt Terry''', was a [[Flanders|Flemish]] television presenter and businesswoman.

==Life and career==
In 1954, she worked for Belgium TV (at that time [[National Institute for Radio Broadcasting|NIR]]). As "Aunt Terry", she presented, together with Bob Davidse ("Nonkel Bob"), the children's program ''Come Take a Look'', and, from 1961 for eighteen years, ''Small, small toddler''. After her resignation in 1979, she became a businesswoman.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.hln.be/tag/terry-van-ginderen|title=Terry Van Ginderen - HLN|website=www.hln.be}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From 1989, when she founded [[Vlaamse Televisie Maatschappij|VTM]] she worked for this channel, again for children's programs, but she also appeared in various juries of game programs. In 1992, she became manager of [[Silvy De Bie|Silvy Melody]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.vrt.be/vrtnws/nl/Obits/-tante--terry-van-ginderen-overleden|title=Televisiepionier "Tante" Terry Van Ginderen is overleden|first=VRT|last=NWS|date=30 January 2018|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Last years and death==
On the occasion of her 75th birthday in 2006, Van Ginderen was received at the [[Antwerp (city)|Antwerp]] City Hall. She was active as a presenter of fashion shows and active with performances for the elderly until her death from [[pneumonia]] at age 86.{{where|date=February 2018}}&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.standaard.be/cnt/dmf20180130_03329421 VRT-icoon Tante Terry overleden] {{nl icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.vrt.be/vrtnws/nl/2018/01/31/uitvaart-van-terry-van-ginderen-op-10-februari|title=Uitvaart van Terry Van Ginderen op 10 februari|first=VRT|last=NWS|date=31 January 2018|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Tippu Tip''', or '''Tippu Tib''' (1832 &amp;ndash; June 14, 1905), real name '''Hamad bin Muhammad bin Juma bin Rajab el Murjebi'''  ({{lang-ar|حمد بن محمد بن جمعة بن رجب بن محمد بن سعيد المرجبي}}), was a [[Swahili people|Swahili]]–[[Zanzibar]]i slave trader, ivory trader, explorer, plantation owner and governor. He worked for a succession of the [[Sultan of Zanzibar|sultans of Zanzibar]]. Tippu Tip traded in slaves for Zanzibar's [[clove]] plantations. As part of the large and lucrative [[ivory trade]], he led many trading expeditions into [[Central Africa]] by constructing profitable trading posts that reached deep into the region. He bought the ivory from local suppliers and resold it for a profit at coastal ports.

==Early life==
[[File:Tippu Tip 1889.jpg|thumb|Drawing of Tippu Tip in [[The Illustrated London News]]. Front cover of 7 December 1889 issue.]]
It is believed that Tippu Tip was born around 1832 on Zanzibar, based on descriptions of his age at points in his life.&lt;ref name= Hinde8/&gt; Tippu Tip's mother, Bint Habib bin Bushir, was a [[Muscat, Oman|Muscat]] [[Arab people|Arab]] of the ruling class. His father and paternal grandfather were coastal [[Swahili people|Swahili]] who had taken part in the earliest trading expeditions to the interior. His paternal great-grandmother, wife of Rajab bin Mohammed bin Said el Murgebi, was the daughter of Juma bin Mohammed el Nebhani, a member of a respected Muscat ([[Oman]]) family, and a [[Bantu peoples|Bantu]] woman from the village of Mbwa Maji, a small village south of what would later become the German capital of [[Dar es Salaam]].&lt;ref&gt;Brode, 7-8&lt;/ref&gt; Tip himself was purportedly of well-bred carriage, with a "[[Negroid]]" countenance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Deckera|first1=Michelle|title=The 'Autobiography' of Tippu Tip|journal=International Journal of Postcolonial Studies|date=2015|volume=17|issue=5|pages=744–758}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Throughout his lifetime Hamad bin Muhammad bin Juma bin Rajab el Murjebi was more commonly known as ''Tippu Tib'', which translates to "the gatherer together of wealth".&lt;ref name= Hinde8/&gt; According to him, he was given the nickname Tippu Tip after the "tiptip" sound that his guns gave off during expeditions in Chungu territory.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Ferant|first1=Leda|title=Tippu Tip and the East African slave trade|date=1972|publisher=Hamilton|page=42|url=https://www.google.com/books?id=McO4AAAAIAAJ|accessdate=24 November 2017|quote=For two months Tippu Tip's caravan camped in Chungu's territory and punitive parties were sent out looking for Samu and his men. According to Tippu Tip this was the time he was given his nick-name because guns went 'tiptip, in a manner too terrible to listen to'.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At a relatively young age, Tippu Tip led a group of about 100 men into Central Africa seeking slaves and ivory.&lt;ref name= Hinde8&gt;{{harvnb|Hinde|1897|p=8}}&lt;/ref&gt; After plundering several large swathes of land he returned to Zanzibar to consolidate his resources and recruit for his forces. Following this he returned to mainland Africa.&lt;ref name= Hinde9&gt;{{harvnb|Hinde|1897|p=9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Later life==
[[File:TipputipPortrait.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Portrait of Tippu Tip, [[House of Wonders]] Museum, [[Stone Town]], [[Zanzibar]].]]
Tippu Tip built himself a trading empire that he then translated into [[clove]] plantations on [[Zanzibar]]. [[Abdul Sheriff]] reported that when he left for his twelve years of "empire building" on the mainland, he had no plantations of his own. By 1895, he had acquired "seven 'shambas' [plantations] and 10,000 slaves".&lt;ref&gt;Sheriff, 108&lt;/ref&gt;

He met and helped several famous western explorers of the [[Africa|African continent]], including [[David Livingstone]] and [[Henry Morton Stanley]].&lt;ref name=Stanley&gt;Stanley, H. M., 1899, ''Through the Dark Continent'', London: G. Newnes, Vol. One {{ISBN|0486256677}}, Vol. Two {{ISBN|0486256685}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|Vol. Two,91–97}} Between 1884 and 1887 he claimed the [[Congo (area)|Eastern Congo]] for himself and for the Sultan of Zanzibar, [[Barghash bin Said of Zanzibar|Bargash bin Said el Busaidi]]. In spite of his position as protector of Zanzibar's interests in [[Congo (area)|Congo]], he managed to maintain good relations with the Europeans. When, in August 1886, fighting broke out between the Swahili and the representatives of King [[Leopold II of Belgium]] at [[Boyoma Falls|Stanley Falls]], al-Murjabī went to the Belgian consul at [[Zanzibar]] to assure him of his "good intentions". Although he was still a force in Central African politics, he could see by 1886 that power in the region was shifting. 

===Governor of the Stanley Falls District===

In early 1887, Stanley arrived in Zanzibar and proposed that Tippu Tip be made governor of the Stanley Falls District in the [[Congo Free State]]. Both Leopold and Sultan [[Barghash bin Said of Zanzibar]] agreed and on February 24, 1887, Tippu Tip accepted.&lt;ref&gt;Bennett and Brode&lt;/ref&gt; At the same time, he agreed to man the expedition which Stanley had been commissioned to organize for the purpose of rescuing [[Emin Pasha]] (E. Schnitzer), the German governor of [[Equatoria]] (a region of [[Khedivate of Egypt|Ottoman Egypt]], today in South Sudan) who had been stranded in the [[Bahr el Ghazal (region of South Sudan)|Bahr el Ghazal]] area as a result of the [[Mahdist Sudan|Mahdi]] uprising in Sudan.{{citation needed|date= January 2016}}

[[File:ZanzibarTipputip.jpg|thumb|upright|Home of Tippu Tip in [[Stone Town]], [[Zanzibar]].]]
Tippu Tip traveled back to the Upper Congo in the company of Stanley, but this time by way of the Atlantic coast and up the Congo River. Aside from its doubtful usefulness, the relief expedition was marred by the near annihilation of its rearguard, a disaster for which Stanley attempted to place the blame on Tippu Tip.

===Congo Arab War===

During his tenure as governor, the [[Congo Arab War|Congo-Arab War]] broke out.  

In 1886, while Tippu Tip was in Zanzibar, a dispute arose between his fort at [[Boyoma Falls|Stanley Falls]] and a smaller, nearby [[Congo Free State]] fort led by Captain Walter Deane and Lt. Dubois. Tip's men at the Stanley Falls fort alleged that Deane had stolen a slave woman from an Arab officer there. Deane asserted that the girl had fled after being badly beaten by her master and that he had only offered her refuge. Tip's men attacked the fort and after a four-day siege, the defenders ran out of ammunition and fled, abandoning the fort. The Free State made no counterattack and Tip began to move more men into the Congo, including several Arab slave captains as well as some Congolese leaders, such as [[Gongo Lutete]].&lt;ref&gt;Edgerton&lt;/ref&gt;
Around 1890/91, he returned to Zanzibar where he retired. His son, [[Sefu bin Hamid|Sefu]], carried on the war in his stead. Tippu Tip wrote his autobiography, which is the first example of this literary genre in the [[Bantu languages|Bantu]] [[Swahili language]]. Dr. Heinrich Brode, who knew him in Zanzibar, transcribed the manuscript into Roman script and translated it into German. It was subsequently translated into English and published in Britain in 1907.

===Death===

Tippu Tip died June 13, 1905, of [[malaria]] (according to Brode) in his home in [[Stone Town]], the main town on the island of Zanzibar.

'''Townsville City''' (also known colloquially as simply "'''The City'''" or "'''The CBD'''") is the name of the central suburb of the city of [[Townsville]], [[Queensland]], Australia. It is the city's [[Central Business District]]. Townsville CBD is a major hub for businesses of all sectors in the Northern Australia region. In the [[census in Australia#2011|2011 census]], Townsville City had a population of 2,500 people.&lt;ref name="ABS2011"&gt;{{Census 2011 AUS|id=SSC31666 |name=Townsville City|accessdate=18 January 2016|quick=on}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Geography ==
Townsville City is a strip of land along the northern-eastern bank [[Ross Creek (North Queensland)|Ross Creek]] at its mouth at the [[Coral Sea]], thus the suburb is bounded to the north by the Coral Sea and to the south-east by Ross Creek. It is overlooked to the west by [[Castle Hill, Queensland|Castle Hill]]. The land is mostly low-lying, just about sea level, apart from [[Melton Hill, Townsville|Melton Hill]] ({{Coord|-19.2559|146.8189|type:moutain_region:AU-QLD|name = Melton Hill}}) which creates a natural boundary to [[North Ward, Queensland|North Ward]] to the north-west.&lt;ref name=globe&gt;{{cite web|title=Queensland Globe|url=https://data.qld.gov.au/dataset/queensland-globe|publisher=[[State of Queensland]]|accessdate=19 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
The Flinders Street public library opened in 1938.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.plconnect.slq.qld.gov.au/__data/assets/pdf_file/0012/388497/SLQ_StatsBulletin1617_20171109.pdf|title=Public Libraries Statistical Bulletin 2016-17|last=|first=|date=November 2017|website=Public Libraries Connect|publisher=[[State Library of Queensland]]|page=16|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=29 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Development==
'''Townsville City''' is home to many regional offices of various government organisations as well as many private companies, serving as a hub for northern Queensland.  There has been extensive construction in the city centre over the last 20 years. These include a major redevelopment on Flinders Street Mall by [[Jarrod McCracken]]'s construction company and the construction of the [[North Queensland Cowboys]] Leagues Club.

Townsville's skyline will change dramatically in as little as 5 years with many projects planned and under construction for the Central Business District (CBD) and Palmer Street. Planning and property experts are now predicting Townsville will have the largest city by size and skyscraper numbers in northern Australia by 2012.{{Citation needed|date=January 2009}} The need for office towers in the city outstrips supply, and as a direct result the CBD is being expanded over the [[Ross River (Queensland)|Ross River]] into the old railway yards decommissioned by the [[Townsville Port]]. The vision includes 22 skyscrapers which in itself will change the face of Townsville forever. As the population nears the crucial 200,000 mark, Townsville is widely available to many businesses because of its large population and being northern [[Australia's]] largest city.{{Citation needed|date=January 2009}}

In 2008, the council committed approximately $60 million on upgrading the Flinders Mall and the CBD with renovations concluding in 2011. A major development of the plan is the addition of a 6-storey shopping centre known as [[Flinders Plaza Shopping Centre, Townsville|Flinders Plaza Shopping Centre]] which currently is in a state of contention as its primary developers have gone into [[receivership]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="15373">A '''union security agreement''' is a contractual agreement, usually part of a [[trade union|union]] [[collective bargaining]] agreement, in which an employer and a trade or labor union agree on the extent to which the union may compel employees to join the union, and/or whether the employer will collect dues, fees, and assessments on behalf of the union.&lt;ref name="Pynes"&gt;Pynes, Joan. ''Human Resources Management for Public and Nonprofit Organizations.'' 2d ed. Hoboken, N.J.: John Wiley and Sons, 2004. {{ISBN|0-7879-7078-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Rationale==
The [[free rider problem]] is often cited as the rationale for union security agreements. A classic study of the free rider problem is presented in [[Mancur Olson]]'s 1965 work, ''[[The Logic of Collective Action]].''&lt;ref&gt;Olson, Mancur. ''The Logic of Collective Action: Public Goods and the Theory of Groups.'' 18th rev. ed. Cambridge, Mass.: Harvard University Press, 1971. {{ISBN|0-674-53751-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; In labor relations, the free rider problem exists because the costs of organizing a union and negotiating a contract with the employer can be very high, and because employers will find it too costly to adopt multiple wage and benefit scales, some or all non-union members may find that the contract benefits them as well.&lt;ref name="Cites"&gt;Towers, Brian. ''The Representation Gap: Change and Reform in the British and American Workplace.'' Oxford, England: Oxford University Press, 1997. {{ISBN|0-19-829319-4}}; Holley, William H.; Jennings, Kenneth M.; and Wolters, Roger S. ''The Labor Relations Process.'' 9th ed. Florence, Ky.: Cengage Learning, 2008. {{ISBN|0-324-42144-3}}; Beatty, David M. ''Putting the Charter to Work: Designing a Constitutional Labour Code.'' Toronto: McGill-Queen's Press - MQUP, 1987. {{ISBN|0-7735-0601-2}}; Bar-Niv, Zvi H. ''International Labour Law Reports, Volume 8.'' Leiden, The Netherlands: Martinus Nijhoff Publishers, 1990. {{ISBN|0-7923-0429-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, the incentive is for some individual workers to "ride for free" by not paying the costs, which can lead to the collapse of the union and no collective bargaining agreement.&lt;ref name="Cites" /&gt; If the union collapses, each worker may be worse off than if the union had negotiated the agreement.&lt;ref name="Cites" /&gt; Union security agreements are one way of ensuring that all (or nearly all) workers pay their fair share of the costs of collective bargaining (e.g., join the union and pay dues).&lt;ref name="Cites" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Not all scholars agree that a free rider problem exists in labor relations. See: Baird, Charles W. ''Opportunity or Privilege: Labor Legislation in America.'' New York: Transaction Publishers, 1984. {{ISBN|0-912051-02-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are alternative solutions to the free rider problem in labor relations. One solution is for the state to provide rights (such as the right to administer welfare or pension funds, or to participate in a [[works council]]) or benefits (such as [[Unemployment benefits|unemployment insurance]]) only to unions or their members.&lt;ref name="Rothstein"&gt;Rothstein, Bo. "Labour-Market Institutions and Working-Class Strength." In ''Power Resources Theory and the Welfare State: A Critical Approach: Essays Collected in Honour of Walter Korpi.'' Julia Sila O'Connor and Gregg Matthew Olsen, eds. Toronto: University of Toronto Press, 1998. {{ISBN|0-8020-7171-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Daubler"&gt;Daubler, Wolfgang. "The Individual and the Collective: No Problem for German Labor Law?" ''Comparative Labor Law and Policy Journal.'' 10:505 (Summer 1989).&lt;/ref&gt; Another solution is for unions to engage in members-only collective bargaining, which restricts the benefits of the contract to union members.&lt;ref&gt;[[Charles Morris (legal educator)|Morris, Charles]]. ''[[The Blue Eagle At Work|The Blue Eagle At Work: Reclaiming Democratic Rights In The American Workplace]].'' Ithaca, N.Y.: ILR Press, 2004. {{ISBN|0-8014-4317-2}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Ulman"&gt;Ulman, Lloyd; Eichengreen, Barry J.; and Dickens, William T. ''Labor and an Integrated Europe.'' Washington, D.C.: Brookings Institution Press, 1993. {{ISBN|0-8157-8681-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legal status==
The [[International Labour Organization]]'s [[Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention]] can "in no way be interpreted as authorising or prohibiting union security arrangements, such questions being matters for regulation in accordance with national practice."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ilo.org/ilolex/cgi-lex/pdconv.pl?host=status01&amp;textbase=iloeng&amp;document=1905&amp;chapter=3&amp;query=(Denmark)+%40ref&amp;highlight=&amp;querytype=bool&amp;context=0 "Case(s) No(s). 188, Report No. 34 (Denmark): Complaints against the Government of Denmark presented by Swiss Printing Workers' Union and the Swiss Federation of National Christian Trade Unions."] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110604190504/http://www.ilo.org/ilolex/cgi-lex/pdconv.pl?host=status01&amp;textbase=iloeng&amp;document=1905&amp;chapter=3&amp;query=(Denmark)+@ref&amp;highlight=&amp;querytype=bool&amp;context=0 |date=2011-06-04 }} Document No. 031960034188. Cases of the Committee on Freedom of Association. International Labor Organization. March 4, 1959.&lt;/ref&gt;

Union security agreements are explicitly mentioned in the labor laws of many countries. They are highly regulated by law and court rulings in the [[United States]]&lt;ref name="Pynes" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Gold, Michael Evan. ''An Introduction to Labor Law.'' 2d rev. ed. Ithaca, N.Y.: Cornell University Press, 1998. {{ISBN|0-8014-8477-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; and to a lesser degree in the United Kingdom.&lt;ref name="Ulman" /&gt; In [[Canada]], the legal status of the union security agreement varies from province to province and at the federal level, with a few provinces permitting but not requiring it but the majority of provinces (and the federal government) requiring it if the union requests it.&lt;ref&gt;Bennett, James T. and Kaufman, Bruce E. ''The Future of Private Sector Unionism in the United States.'' Armonk, N.Y.: M.E. Sharpe, 2002. {{ISBN|0-7656-0852-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In most [[Western European]] countries, the [[closed shop]] (one form of the union security agreement) is banned, while other forms go unregulated in labor law.&lt;ref name="Ulman" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kassalow, Everett M. "The Closed and Union Shop in Western Europe: An American Perspective." ''Journal of Labor Research.'' 1:2 (June 1980).&lt;/ref&gt; But this is not a uniform conclusion, and law may vary widely. For example, in [[Germany]] both the right to join a union and the right ''not'' to join a union are equally protected by law and the courts, and all forms of union security agreements are banned.&lt;ref name="Daubler" /&gt; The law in [[Belgium]] has similar provisions.&lt;ref name="Ulman" /&gt; Still, since participation in the unemployment insurance system is compulsory and only unions have the right to administer this system, union membership in Belgium remains high.&lt;ref name="Rothstein" /&gt;

Outside [[North America]] and [[Western Europe]], the legal status of union security agreements varies even more widely. In [[New Zealand]], as of 1988, the closed shop was compulsory where a union organized the workplace.&lt;ref&gt;Davidson, Alexander. ''Two Models of Welfare: The Origins and Development of the Welfare State in Sweden and New Zealand, 1888-1988.'' Stockholm: Almqvist and Wiksell International, 1989. {{ISBN|91-554-2486-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[Philippines]], various types of union security agreements are permitted under labor law.&lt;ref&gt;Mendoza, Quintin C. ''The Philippine Labor Relations Law.'' Manila, Philippines: Rex Book Store, 2001. {{ISBN|971-23-0583-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Mexico]], the closed shop was mandatory until the early 1990s, when a change in federal law permitted the [[union shop]], [[agency shop]], or no agreement at all.&lt;ref&gt;Befort, Stephen F. and Cornett, Virginia E. "Beyond the Rhetoric of the NAFTA Treaty Debate: A Comparative Analysis of Labor and Employment Law in Mexico and the United States." ''Comparative Labor Law and Policy Journal.'' 17:269 (Winter 1996).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="LaBotz"&gt;LaBotz, Dan. ''Mask of Democracy: Labor Suppression in Mexico Today.'' Boston: South End Press, 1992. {{ISBN|0-89608-437-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; But because of the political ties between unions and the governing party in Mexico and other ways in which Mexican law favors established unions, the closed shop is essentially still the norm.&lt;ref name="LaBotz" /&gt;

Many countries, however, have not addressed the issue of union security agreements. Neither [[Indonesia]]n nor [[Thailand|Thai]] labor law addresses the issue, and in both countries collective bargaining, union administrative procedures, and dues collection are so weak that the union security issues rarely arise.&lt;ref&gt;Levine, Marvin J. ''Worker Rights and Labor Standards in Asia's Four New Tigers: A Comparative Perspective.'' New York: Springer, 1997. {{ISBN|0-306-45477-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Australia]], the legal status of union security agreements has varied widely across each state and the national government and over time. Australian labor law does not explicitly regulate union security agreements. However, various forms of the union security agreement have been favored at one time or another by each state, territory, or the national government, effectively regulating the favored type of union security agreement and disadvantaging its other forms.&lt;ref&gt;Weeks, Phillipa. ''Trade Union Security Law: A Study of Preference and Compulsory Unionism.'' Annandale, NSW, Australia: Federation Press, 1995. {{ISBN|1-86287-167-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Types==
Various types of union security agreements exist.  Among the more common are:
*'''[[Closed shop]]'''—The employer agrees to hire only union members. An employee who resigns from the union must be dismissed.&lt;ref name="Pynes" /&gt;
*'''[[Union shop]]'''—The employer may hire anyone regardless of their union membership status, but the employee must join the union within a set time period (such as 30 days). An employee who resigns from the union must be dismissed.&lt;ref name="Pynes" /&gt;
*'''[[Agency shop]]'''—The employer may hire anyone regardless of their union membership status, and the employee need not join the union. However, all non-union employees must pay a fee (known as the "agency fee") to the union to cover the costs of collective bargaining (and, in some countries, other fees as well). An employee who resigns from the union may not be dismissed but must pay the agency fee.&lt;ref name="Pynes" /&gt;
*'''Fair share provision'''—The employer may hire anyone regardless of their union membership status, and the employee need not join the union. However, all non-union employees must pay a fee (known as the "fair share fee") to the union to cover the costs of collective bargaining. An employee who resigns from the union may not be dismissed but must pay the fair share fee.&lt;ref name="Pynes" /&gt; In public sector collective bargaining, where the agency shop is often outlawed, the fair share provision (almost identical to the agency fee) may be negotiated instead.&lt;ref&gt;Marczely, Bernadette. ''Human Resource and Contract Management in the Public School: A Legal Perspective.'' New York: Rowman &amp; Littlefield, 2002. {{ISBN|0-8108-4379-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''Dues checkoff'''—A contract between the employer and union where the employer agrees to collect the dues, fees, assessments, and other monies from union members and/or non-members directly from each worker's paycheck and transmit those funds to the union on a regular basis.&lt;ref name="Pynes" /&gt;

== Janus v. AFSCME ==
''Janus v. American Federation of State, County, and Municipal Employees, Council 31'', _ US _ (2018) is a [[US labor law]] case, concerning whether governments violate the [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|First Amendment]] when they require their employees to pay fees to a union as a condition of employment.

In February 2015, [[Illinois]] Republican Governor [[Bruce Rauner]] filed suit, claiming that [[Fair-share agreement|fair-share agreements]] are unconstitutional and a violation of the [[First Amendment]] right to free speech.

In March 2015, three government workers from Illinois represented by attorneys from the Illinois-based Liberty Justice Center and Virginia-based National Right to Work Legal Defense Foundation took legal action to intervene in the case.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.illinoispolicy.org/press-releases/state-workers-in-illinois-sue-to-end-mandatory-union-fees/|title=State workers in Illinois sue to end mandatory union fees|date=2015-03-23|work=Illinois Policy|access-date=2018-06-21|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/04/06/union-stronghold-forced-dues.html|title=Unions battle for survival in key strongholds as court cases challenge forced dues|last=Ravve|first=Ruth|date=2015-04-06|work=Fox News|access-date=2018-06-21|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://chicago.suntimes.com/news/3-state-employees-want-to-join-rauner-lawsuit-over-fair-share-union-fees/|title=3 state employees want to join Rauner lawsuit over ‘fair share’ union fees|work=Chicago Sun-Times|access-date=2018-06-21|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; In May 2015, Rauner was dropped from the case, after a federal judge ruled that the governor did not have standing to bring such a suit, but the case proceeded under a new name, ''Janus v.

Janus claimed that he should not need to pay fees to the [[American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees]] because doing so constitutes paying for political speech with which Janus disagrees.&lt;ref&gt;https://ljc-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/2016/12/Rauner-v.-AFSCME-120-First-Amended-Complaint-2015.06.01.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; This became permissible after a 1977 decision by the [[US Supreme Court]] in ''[[Abood v. Detroit Board of Education]]''.

In June 2018, the [[US Supreme Court]] ruled in favor of Janus, in a 5-4 decision, and stated that "States and public-sector unions may no longer extract agency fees from nonconsenting employees".&lt;ref&gt;https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/17pdf/16-1466_2b3j.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Vitaly Dmitrievich Arkhangelsky''' (born May 23, 1975, Almaty, Kazakhstan) is a Russian entrepreneur with interests in shipping and insurance. The Russian authorities are seeking his extradition from France, where he and his family currently live, to face charges of economic crimes.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.nicematin.com/article/derniere-minute/un-opposant-russe-en-exil-a-nice-est-la-cible-du-kremlin&lt;/ref&gt; Arkhangelsky claims that he is a victim of expropriation and persecution by the associates of [[St.Petersburg]] ex-mayor [[Valentina Matvienko]].&lt;ref name="LeMonde"&gt;[http://www.lemonde.fr/cgi-bin/ACHATS/acheter.cgi?offre=ARCHIVES&amp;type_item=ART_ARCH_30J&amp;objet_id=1141362 "La guérilla judiciaire d'un homme d'affaires russe incarcéré en France"] [[Le Monde]] 25 November 2010&lt;/ref&gt; His case has been widely reported in the Russian and international media.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thefrenchpaper.com/index.php/news/view/bank-tried-to-ruin-me-says-tycoon "‘Bank tried to ruin me’ says tycoon"] [[TheFrenchPaper]] 28 November 2010&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.inosmi.ru/economic/20101126/164488444.html?id=164498094]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="tradewinds"&gt;[http://www.tradewinds.no/archive/?q=Arkhangelsky "Vitaly Arkhangelsky. Profile"] [[TradeWinds]]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life and education==
He studied economics at [[Saint Petersburg State University|St Petersburg State University]], and pursued postgraduate research at the State University of Economics and Finance, also in St Petersburg. He additionally trained in Germany and at the [[Trondheim Business School]] in Norway.

==Career==
After completing his studies he worked in the insurance sector.  This led to a focus on shipping, and to the foundation in 1999 of the Oslo Marine Group (OMG), of which he is president and majority shareholder.  OMG is a holding company with interests in insurance, port services and freight forwarding.&lt;ref&gt;[http://investing.businessweek.com/businessweek/research/stocks/private/snapshot.asp?privcapId=34482056 "Oslo Marine Group Ltd."] [[Businessweek]]&lt;/ref&gt;  It expanded rapidly, opening representative offices in London and Hiroshima and acquiring major real estate assets in Russia, including the Vyborg Port and Western Terminal, a site within the port of St Petersburg, with redevelopment plans the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development.  OMG also expanded its fleet, and placed orders for the building of new ships.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.globmaritime.com/news/shipping-logistics/6585-oslo-marine-puts-fleet-plans-on-ice.html "Oslo Marine puts fleet plans on ice"] [[Globmaritime]] 23 March 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

These core assets of OMG are the subject of a legal dispute between Arkhangelsky and Bank of St. Petersburg, from which OMG had secured loans to finance its expansion.&lt;ref&gt;[http://johnhelmer.net/?p=1441 "GRIP OR GRAB — OSLO MARINE GROUP FIGHTS BANK ST PETERSBURG FOR MARINE ASSETS"] [[Dances with Bears]] 21 July 2009&lt;/ref&gt;  In 2009 a Russian court ruled that the acquisition of Western Terminal by Sevzapalyans, believed to be controlled by Bank of St Petersburg, was illegal.&lt;ref&gt;Russian court voids acquisition of OMG terminal by little-known co. 28 September 2009, Prime-TASS News (Russia)&lt;/ref&gt;  

In 2010 these disputes were in progress when criminal investigations into Arkhangelsky were initiated in Russia, and charges made.  Arkhangelsky was alleged by the Russian authorities to have laundered 56.5 million roubles fraudulently acquired from Morskoi Aktsionerni Bank (MAB).&lt;ref&gt;Petersburg entrepreneur suspected of laundering RUB 56 mln. 28 July 2010, 
ITAR-TASS World Service&lt;/ref&gt;

==Fleeing to France and legal counteroffensive==

In 2009 Arkhangelsky and his family fled to Nice, France, where he claimed political asylum. This was followed by a Russian extradition request on charges of fraud. A judge in Nice freed him on a bail of 300,000 euros pending a hearing, which can last many months.&lt;ref name="AFP1"&gt;[http://www.expatica.com/fr/news/french-news/russian-opposition-tycoon-claims-bank-tried-to-ruin-him_113074.html "Russian opposition tycoon claims bank tried to ruin him"] [[Agence France Presse]] 25 November 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

From France Arkhangelsky mounted a legal counteroffensive, claiming that he was a victim of a campaign to ruin him orchestrated by the ex-Mayor of St Petersburg [[Valentina Matvienko]].&lt;ref name="LeMonde" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lloydslist.com/ll/sector/regulation/article349498.ece "Vitaly Arkhangelsky blames corruption for empire fall"] [[Lloyd's List]] 9 November 2010&lt;/ref&gt; He argued that the Bank St Petersburg refused to allow OMG to restructure its debts with the deliberate intention of bankrupting it and taking control of its assets.&lt;ref name="AFP1" /&gt; In August 2011 he issued a writ of summons in the District Court of Nicosia, Cyprus, against “three shadowy Cypriot companies”, which he claimed were set up exclusively for the purpose of stealing his assets for the benefit of a "group of conspirators", which "probably" included the ex-Mayor of St. Petersburg's and the ex-Chief of Police.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tradewindsnews.com/archive/?q=Arkhangelsky  "Arkhangelsky targets ‘shadowy’ Cypriots"] [[Tradewinds]] August 5, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;
