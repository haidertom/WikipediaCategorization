In the United Kingdom, [[Association football|football]] clubs sometimes choose to enter [[Administration (law)|administration]] when they are unable to pay off outstanding [[debt]]s. Under the [[Insolvency Act 1986]], a business will face a winding-up order bringing them to court and if it is shown that a business cannot pay debts as they fall due or cannot repay outstanding debts then the company will be classified as [[UK insolvency law#Definition|insolvent]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1986/45/section/123|title=Insolvency Act 1986 (c. 45) – Part IV Winding Up of Companies Registered under the Companies Acts – Chapter VI Winding Up by the Court – Grounds and effect of winding-up petition|work=[[UK Statute Law Database]]|publisher=[[Office of Public Sector Information]]|accessdate=13 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; '''Administration''' puts accountants "in charge of pretty much everything apart from coaching the players and picking the team".&lt;ref name="Administration"/&gt; For a football club in administration, the "football creditors rule" requires football-related debts such as wages owed to players and staff, and transfer fees owed to other clubs to be paid first.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/7741859.stm|title=Football clubs owe tax millions |last=Grant|first=Paul|date=23 November 2008|publisher=BBC Sport|accessdate=26 February 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==England and Wales==
In 2000, [[ITV Digital]] bought the broadcasting rights to [[The Football League|Football League]] and [[Football League Cup|League Cup]] matches in a three-year, £315m deal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-110973/Fears-soccer-clubs-ITV-Digital-sale.html|title=Fears for soccer clubs as ITV Digital is put up for sale|work=[[The Daily Mail]]|accessdate=14 March 2010|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; In March 2002, the company went bankrupt owing the League £180&amp;nbsp;million which it said it "cannot afford to pay".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/business/1896732.stm|title=ITV Digital goes broke|date=27 March 2002|publisher=[[BBC News]]|accessdate=14 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result of this many Football League clubs had financial problems and entered administration.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/business/1898021.stm|title=ITV Digital woes bring football crisis|date=28 March 2002|publisher=[[BBC News]]|accessdate=14 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2002/oct/22/newsstory.sport|title= Crisis clubs|date=22 October 2002|work=[[The Guardian]]|accessdate=13 October 2013 | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Before the implementation of a points deduction it was perceived that clubs had "manipulated and abused [administration] as a way of shedding debts then restructuring, and borrowing again once the hapless creditors had been fobbed off with their 8p in the pound".&lt;ref name="Administration"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/7305998.stm|title= Football administration|last=Farquhar|first=Gordon|date=20 March 2008|publisher=BBC Sport|accessdate=26 February 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; In September 2003, it was proposed that clubs entering administration would be docked 10 points. A [[Fit and proper person test|'fit and proper persons' test]] was also introduced in an attempt to prevent fraudulent activities. If a person was previously director at a club which was in "administration twice during a five-year period" or at "two different clubs that have each gone into administration in a five-year period" then they would be prevented from becoming the controlling shareholder of a [[Football League]] club.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/5030910.stm|title= The murky world of football finances|last=Summers|first=Chris|date=28 June 2006|publisher=[[BBC News]]|accessdate=13 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; A 'fit and proper persons' test was also introduced for directors of [[Premier League]] clubs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.premierleague.com/staticFiles/12/66/0,,12306~91666,00.pdf#page=17 |title=The F.A.

To ease financial problems for clubs that had been relegated, "parachute payments" were introduced to give time to adapt to the financial gulf between divisions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/football/news-and-comment/points-threat-to-clubs-choosing-administration-580968.html|title=Points threat to clubs choosing administration|last=Warshaw|first=Andrew|date=24 September 2003|work=[[The Independent]]|accessdate=26 February 2010 | location=London| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20100409015315/http://www.independent.co.uk/sport/football/news-and-comment/points-threat-to-clubs-choosing-administration-580968.html| archivedate= 9 April 2010 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; The deductions of 10 points in the [[Football League]] and 9 points in the [[Premier League]] were ratified in 2004, with the rule in place from the start of the 2004–05 season.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://breaking.tcm.ie/archives/2004/0115/sport/chairmen-to-agree-points-deductions-129765.html|title=Chairmen to agree points deductions|date=15 January 2004|work=[[BreakingNews.ie]]|publisher=[[Thomas Crosbie Holdings]]|accessdate=26 February 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="PL"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2004/jan/30/newsstory.sport14|title=Crisis clubs will lose nine points|last=Chaudhary|first=Vivek|date=20 January 2004|work=[[The Guardian]]|accessdate=13 October 2013 | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; The League also adopted rules that prevented any side from being in administration for either two successive seasons or eighteen consecutive months.&lt;ref name="Wrexham"/&gt; The reason for the deduction being a point less in the Premier League was that the teams play eight fewer fixtures than Football League clubs.&lt;ref name="PL"/&gt; The first club to incur this new penalty were [[League One]] side [[Wrexham F.C.]] who entered administration on 3 December 2004.&lt;ref name="Wrexham"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/wales/4064257.stm|title= Wrexham FC in administration|date=3 December 2004|publisher=BBC News|accessdate=26 February 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Leeds United A.F.C.|Leeds United]] filed for administration with only a few days remaining in the [[2006–07 Football League Championship|2006–07 season]], which automatically triggered a 10-point penalty. This placed Leeds at the bottom of the table and relegated the club, but they were extremely likely to have been relegated anyway. By entering administration during the 2006–07 season, they hoped to avoid starting the [[2007–08 Football League#League One|2007–08 season]] on −10 points. The following week, [[Boston United F.C.|Boston United]] entered administration in the final minutes of a defeat to [[Wrexham A.F.C.|Wrexham]] which ensured they were relegated to the [[Football Conference]], meaning they likewise avoided starting the following season on -10 points (though they would find themselves being double-relegated to the Conference North for unrelated reasons).&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/b/boston_united/6738469.stm Boston suffer new demotion blow]&lt;/ref&gt; The Football League saw both cases as clubs trying to exploit a loophole, and changed the rules. From 2007–08, any club entering administration after the fourth Thursday in March would have their 10-point deduction suspended until the following season. If the club is relegated the points will be deducted from their tally at the start of next season. If the club stays up the 10 points will be taken off their final total.
&lt;ref name="Loophole"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/6736997.stm|title=League closes 10-point loophole |date=9 June 2007|publisher=BBC Sport|accessdate=26 February 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 26 February 2010, [[Portsmouth F.C.|Portsmouth]] became the first Premier League club to enter administration.&lt;ref name="Portsmouth"/&gt;

===Football creditors rule===
In a situation of insolvency, the "football creditors rule" means that debts to other clubs or players are prioritised and must be paid in full before the club is eligible to compete again in the league.&lt;ref name="Lawyer"&gt;{{cite web|last=Plainer|first=Adam|title=Paying by the rules|url=http://www.thelawyer.com/paying-by-the-rules/1003055.article|work=[[The Lawyer]]|accessdate=31 May 2010|date=11 January 2010| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20100512172003/http://www.thelawyer.com/paying-by-the-rules/1003055.article| archivedate= 12 May 2010 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Enterprise Act 2002]] made reforms to the insolvency act and, from 15 September 2003, the altered procedures for administration were implemented.&lt;ref name="Ent02"&gt;{{cite web|title=Frequently Asked Questions about the Enterprise Act: Company|url=http://www.insolvency.gov.uk/faq/faqeactc.htm|publisher=[[Insolvency Service|The Insolvency Service]]|accessdate=31 May 2010| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20100505053545/http://www.insolvency.gov.uk/faq/faqeactc.htm| archivedate= 5 May 2010 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most notably it abolished the Crown's preferential right to recover unpaid taxes ahead of other creditors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Enterprise Act changes to be introduced in June|url=http://www.out-law.com/page-3501|date=24 April 2003|work=[[OUT-LAW]]|accessdate=31 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; As such, [[HM Revenue and Customs]] (HMRC) is now often not paid in full (between 2003 and 2010, outstanding unpaid taxes to the HMRC amounted to £30 million).&lt;ref name="Guardian"&gt;{{cite news|title=Crunched creditors call time on living the dream|first=Dave|last=Conn|url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/david-conn-inside-sport-blog/2010/feb/10/portsmouth-cardiff-hmrc-winding-up|work=[[The Guardian]]|date=10 February 2010|accessdate=13 October 2013|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; This legality of the football creditors rule was challenged in 2004 in ''[[Inland Revenue Commissioners v The Wimbledon Football Club Ltd]]''. However, it was found that "full payment to football creditors (out of third party funds) ahead of preferential creditors did not infringe the provisions of section s4(4)(a) of the Act" and "differential treatment may be necessary to secure the continuation of the company's business and may be regarded as supportable".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Company Voluntary Arrangements |first=John |last=Verrill |url=http://www.dundas-wilson.com/publications/dw_cms_4894.pdf |publisher=[[Dundas &amp; Wilson]] |date=1 September 2008 |accessdate=31 May 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111002071144/http://www.dundas-wilson.com/publications/dw_cms_4894.pdf |archivedate=2 October 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2011 HMRC brought another challenge to the football creditors rule in the High Court, this time on the basis that it breached fundamental principles of insolvency law, including the [[pari passu]] rule that all unsecured creditors should be paid on a proportionate basis. However, in May 2012 the court rejected the challenge as it found that the rule was not a deliberate evasion of insolvency law.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=HM Revenue and Customs v The Football League Ltd [2012] EWHC 1372 (Ch)|url=http://www.bailii.org/ew/cases/EWHC/Ch/2012/1372.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Scotland==
Following the adoption of a points sanction in the [[The Football League|English Football League]], a similar rule was proposed for adoption by the [[Scottish Premier League]] (SPL) in December 2003.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/scot_prem/3331583.stm|title=SPL debate administration penalty |date=18 December 2003|publisher=BBC |work=BBC Sport|accessdate=1 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was announced in January 2004 that SPL clubs going into administration in the [[2004–05 Scottish Premier League|2004–05 season]] would be subject to a 10-point deduction and be prevented from signing new players. With [[Motherwell F.C.|Motherwell]] and [[Dundee F.C.|Dundee]] already in administration at the time, it was decided that if "they are not in the process of coming out of administration by 31 May", the deduction would be applied at the start of the following season.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/scot_prem/3418773.stm|title=Dundee face point deduction|date=22 January 2004|publisher=BBC |work=BBC Sport|accessdate=1 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, the [[Scottish Football Association]] would not allow clubs in administration to play in European competition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/scot_prem/3415935.stm |title=Uefa blow for cash-strapped clubs |date=21 January 2004 |publisher=BBC |work=BBC Sport |accessdate=1 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Both Motherwell and Dundee met the required conditions to avoid the deduction of points.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/d/dundee/3749583.stm |title=Dundee rescue plan agreed |date=26 May 2004 |publisher=BBC |work=BBC Sport |accessdate=1 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 10 point penalty was subsequently applied to [[Gretna F.C.|Gretna]] in the 2007&amp;ndash;08 season&lt;ref name="Administration"/&gt; and [[Rangers F.C.|Rangers]] in 2011&amp;ndash;12.&lt;ref name = "simply the bust"/&gt;

Although the [[Scottish Football League]] (SFL) had no automatic deduction of points for clubs going into administration, it reserved the right to "deduct championship points before or during a season and/or to impose a player registration embargo on any club".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Scottish Football League Handbook 2009–2010|publisher=[[Scottish Football League]]|pages=148|chapter=Constitution and Rules |url=http://www.scottishfootballleague.com/res/documents/SFL/SFLHandbook/SFL%20Constitution%20and%20Rules2.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; This meant that its penalties for insolvency varied; [[Dundee F.C.|Dundee]] were docked 25 points in the 2010&amp;ndash;11 season because it was the second time they had entered administration in a relatively short period.&lt;ref name = "changes"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/football/scottish-football/10365208/SPFL-clubs-that-go-into-administration-could-be-relegated.html |title=SPFL clubs that go into administration could be relegated |first=Ewing |last=Grahame |work=Daily Telegraph |publisher=Telegraph Media Group |date=9 October 2013 |accessdate=18 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The SFL also had the power to place a team in the bottom tier ([[Scottish Football League Third Division|Third Division]]) if there were any doubts that the club could fulfill their fixtures for the forthcoming season.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Livi relegated to Division Three |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/teams/l/livingston/8179998.stm |publisher=BBC |work=BBC Sport |accessdate=8 November 2011 |date=5 August 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[administration and liquidation of The Rangers Football Club Plc]] prompted much discussion in Scotland about what sanctions (if any) are appropriate for an insolvent club.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/17975013 |title=SPL board can't win over Rangers decision - Stephen Thompson |date=6 May 2012 |accessdate=18 December 2013 |work=BBC Sport |publisher=BBC}}&lt;/ref&gt; When Rangers entered administration in February 2012, the club was docked 10 points in the [[2011&amp;ndash;12 Scottish Premier League]].

The organization claims its members collectively employ more than 150,000 people and generate billions in economic activity each year.&lt;ref name=AEG&gt;[http://albertaenterprisegroup.com/about-us ''Alberta Enterprise Group'', About us, Accessed: Feb. 3, 2012] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111231054038/http://albertaenterprisegroup.com/about-us |date=December 31, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The organization states its mission as applying the collective experience of its members in order to solve public policy challenges and to form and promote public policy solutions and to provide forums for the exchange of ideas and best practices.&lt;ref name=AEG/&gt;

==History==
In 2006 a group of Alberta business leaders came together to form a [[fundraising]]/[[political]] action group called Grassroots Leadership Group.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=|last=|title= 
Norris takes business approach to leadership|url=http://www.edsonleader.com/ArticleDisplay.aspx?archive=true&amp;e=1908414|publisher=''Edson Leader'' |year=2006|accessdate=2012-02-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; The group unsuccessfully supported [[Mark Norris (Canadian politician)|Mark Norris]] on the first [[ballot]] in his [[Progressive Conservative Association of Alberta]] leadership bid. After Norris dropped off the ballot, the group supported eventual winner [[Ed Stelmach]] on the second ballot.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Calgary|last=Herald|title=

After the PC leadership process, Grassroots Leadership Group members decided to keep the group together as a business advocacy organization and re-branded as Alberta Enterprise Group, headed by then-Chairman [[Cal Nichols]].

Until 2013 the organization was led by Tim Shipton until his departure in November of that year.&lt;ref name="Tim Shipton"&gt;{{cite web|title=Tim Shipton joins Rexall Sports Corp.|url=http://oilers.nhl.com/club/news.htm?id=688214|website=oilers.nhl.com|publisher=Edmonton Oilers|accessdate=5 June 2014|ref=21}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Tim Shipton was previously director of the [[Progressive Conservative Association of Alberta]].&lt;ref name=AEG/&gt;

In February, 2014 the organization announced the appointment of Josh Bilyk as President.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=New leadership at business advocacy group|url=http://albertaenterprisegroup.com/new-leadership-at-business-advocacy-group-3/|website=www.albertaenterprisegroup.com|publisher=Alberta Enterprise Group|accessdate=5 June 2014|ref=22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Activities==
The organization has conducted several meetings over the years trying to draw more business to Canada.  In 2008 AEG brought 100 of the province's business leaders to [[Washington D.C.]] to meet with congressional leaders and [[United States]] business leaders.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.international.alberta.ca/documents/International/Premier_Mission_to_Washington_DC.pdf|title=International Premier Mission to Washington|accessdate=2012-02-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; Then in 2009 the organization brought more than 60 of the province's business leaders to [[Geneva, Switzerland]] in an effort to showcase Alberta to the [[Europe]]an investment community. In both 2008 and 2009 the organization brought more than 150 businessmen and politicians from across [[North America]] to tour the [[Alberta oil sands|oil sands mining operations]]. Participants  visited [[Syncrude]], [[Albian]] and CNRL's Horizon Mine.&lt;ref name=AEG/&gt;

In the spring of 2010, AEG organized the Alberta Connects outreach mission to [[Ottawa]].  Alberta Connects introduced AEG members to [[Prime Minister]] [[Stephen Harper]], Finance Minister Flaherty, Environment Minister Prentice, Liberal Leader [[Michael Ignatieff]] and 55 other Members of Parliament and Senators.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aimcapitalcorp.com/pages/EventReview-AlbertaConnect2010.pdf|title=Alberta Connects 2010|accessdate=2012-02-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2011, the group returned to Washington, D.C. to engage U.S political leaders in a discussion on improving trade relations between Canada and the United States and ensuring market access for Canadian energy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blogs.edmontonjournal.com/2011/05/26/david-maclean-in-washington-a-guest-blog/|title=''Edmonton Journal'', David MacLean in Washington: a guest blog|accessdate=2013-03-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2012, the group brought a delegation of 40 business leaders to Quebec to meet with business and political leaders in that province, purportedly to improve trade ties between the two provinces.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://albertaenterprisegroup.com/news/canada-connects-quebec-review|title=''ALG'', Canada Connect Quebec|accessdate=2013-03-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2015, the group [https://edmontonjournal.com/opinion/columnists/gary-lamphier-heres-a-new-one-alberta-firms-seek-opportunities-in-b-c organized a trade mission to British Columbia] where it met with British Columbia Energy and Mines Minister Bill Bennett, First Nations Energy &amp; Mining Council CEO Dave Porter, and Iain Black, CEO of the Vancouver Board of Trade and others. A mission highlight was a keynote address by MEG Energy CEO Bill McCaffrey.

The organization is a strong proponent of what it calls "sustainable resource development," arguing that impediments to resource development imposed by excessive regulation hurt the Canadian economy and government revenues.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://vancouversun.com/business/2035/Barbara+Yaffe+Alberta+must+satisfy+each+other+pipeline+concerns/7917453/story.html|title=''Vancouver Sun'', Barbara Yaffe: B.C., Alberta must satisfy each other's pipeline concerns|accessdate=2013-03-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The group has also been engaged in the discussion on Alberta's provincial budget, advocating spending restraint as opposed to tax increases to address a growing government deficit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://calgaryherald.com/opinion/columnists/talk+about+control+public+spending/7538139/story.html|title=''Calgary Herald'', MacLean: Let's talk about out-of-control public spending|accessdate=2013-03-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Business taxation advocacy===
In April 2015, during the [[2015 Alberta general election campaign]] the group released a [http://albertaenterprisegroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/AEG-Alberta-business-tax-competitiveness-April-28-2015-final.pdf study] [https://calgaryherald.com/opinion/columnists/maclean-its-a-bad-idea-to-raise-corporate-taxes arguing that increasing business taxes would kill jobs and investment, increase consumer prices and reduce wages for workers.]

===Labour Reform===
The organization has also published information regarding [[collective bargaining]]. In December 2009 AEG released a study calling for reforms to provincial [[labour laws]], hoping to create good business climates while upholding the collective bargaining rights of workers. The paper argued that the Canada's labour laws lag behind [[Europe]], [[Australia]] and the [[United Kingdom]].  Some of the recommendations in the study included: having membership cards instead of signing petitions; requiring a quorum, and allowing unionized workers in Alberta be allowed opt out of the portion of their union dues that is spent on lobbying and political activities.&lt;ref name=labour&gt;{{cite web|url=http://albertaenterprisegroup.com/news/aeg-calls-for-labour-reform|title=Alberta Enterprise Group calls for Labour Reform|accessdate=2012-02-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; The organization supported enacting a Worker Free Choice Act (WFCA) to which would allow workers the right to choose whether or not to join or financially support a union as a condition of employment. Bob Barnetson, who is an associate professor of labour relations at Athabasca University, spoke out against the study's conclusions and how it was conducted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://albertalabour.blogspot.com/2011/01/labour-reform-courtesy-of-alberta.html|title=Labour reform courtesy of the Alberta Enterprise Group|accessdate=2012-02-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;  However, the study was endorsed by the Merit Contractors Association, Canadian Constitution Foundation and the Canadian Federation of Independent Business.&lt;ref name=labour/&gt; A survey conducted by AEG also found that 65 percent believed 70 percent of employees should vote to certify or decertify a union.  The poll also found that 78 percent agreed that union dues should only be spent on collective bargaining and union management instead of policy influence.

===Edmonton City Centre Airport===
Also in 2009, the organization waged a campaign to save the [[Edmonton City Centre Airport]] from closure, arguing that the facility is an economic asset and an important component of the province's health system, saying it provided $400 million in economic output annually.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://albertaenterprisegroup.com/Ascend_AEG_report_--_June_23rd_Final.pdf|title=Ascent AEG Report|accessdate=2012-02-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; The group ran a petition to keep the airport open, collecting over 1000 signatures.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=|last=|title=Edmonton City Centre Airport debate heats up online |url=http://www.inews880.com/Channels/Reg/LocalNews/story.aspx?ID=1108542|publisher=''iNews 880'' |date=June 30, 2009|accessdate=2012-02-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; After discussions about compromising and only closing one lane, Edmonton City Councillors ultimately voted to close the [[Edmonton City Centre (Blatchford Field) Airport|airport]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=|last=|title=Kevin Libin: A plot to kill Edmonton's city airport?|url=http://fullcomment.nationalpost.com/2010/07/23/kevin-libin-a-secret-plot-to-kill-edmontons-city-airport/|publisher=''National Post'' |date=July 23, 2010|accessdate=2012-02-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Oil sands===
Im May 2011 AEG went to Washington, D.C. to talk about borders security, [[energy]] development and trade. Participants met with Members of the U.S. House of Representatives and Senate to discuss the pending decision on the [[Keystone XL pipeline]].&lt;ref name=keystone&gt;{{cite news|first=|last=|title=David MacLean in Washington: a guest blog|url=http://blogs.edmontonjournal.com/2011/05/26/david-maclean-in-washington-a-guest-blog/|publisher=''Edmonton Journal'' |date=May 26, 2011|accessdate=2012-02-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The meetings noted that [[tar sands]] knowledge had increased, discussed Canada's commitment to its environment and the benefits of the oil sands to America.  In December 2011, AEG led a counter-boycott of [[Chiquita Bananas]] in response to the company signing on to an anti-oil sands campaign coordinated by [[California]]-based environmental advocacy group Forest Ethics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=|last=|title=Oil sands lobby fires back at Chiquita|url=http://www.canada.com/nationalpost/financialpost/story.html?id=ee91cbbd-2ec0-45e8-a73b-572b2e340f1e|publisher=''National Post'' |date=December 17, 2011|accessdate=2012-02-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; Chiquita later said that it would continue to use Canadian oil.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=|last=|title=Chiquita won't join bunch boycotting Alberta oilsands products|url=https://montrealgazette.com/business/Chiquita+join+bunch+boycotting+oilsands+products/5900976/story.html|publisher=''Montreal Gazette'' |date=December 22, 2011|accessdate=2012-02-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; Levi-Strauss and Timberland were also targeted by AEG in the boycott of the boycotters, but were later taken down from the page after the companies said they would not boycott Canadian oil.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=|last=|title=Canadians Urged to boycott GAP, Levi-Strauss and Timberland|url=http://www.newswire.ca/en/story/681005/canadians-urged-to-boycott-gap-levi-strauss-and-timberland|publisher=''News Wire'' |date=August 27, 2010|accessdate=2012-02-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=|last=|title=Alberta business group applauds Gap, Levi clarification|url=http://www.newswire.ca/en/story/579865/alberta-business-group-applauds-gap-levi-clarification|publisher=''News Wire'' |date=August 31, 2010|accessdate=2012-02-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Andrey Mikhailovich Ryabinskiy''' (born July 17, 1973, Moscow, USSR) – [[Russia]]n entrepreneur, founder and chairman of the board of directors of LLC [[MIC (organization)|Moskovsky Ipotechny Centr Group]]. President of the promotional company World of Boxing. Vice President of the Professional [[Boxing Federation of Russia]].

==Biography==
Andrey Ryabinskiy was born and raised in Moscow.

===Education===
In 1998, Andrey graduated from secondary school No.1158 in Moscow, and in 1998, from the G.V. Plekhanov Russian Academy of Economics as a specialist in Cybernetics. From 2009 to 2011, he studied at the [[Russian Presidential Academy of National Economy and Public Administration|Academy of National Economy under the Government of the Russian Federation]], where he earned a [[Doctor of Business Administration|DBA]]. 

===Professional Activities===
As a student, Andrey started working in a major Moscow real estate company. There, he met Aleksandr Kopylkov, and in 1999 they founded MIC Group together. Having initially focused exclusively on real-estate work, the company began investing in housing construction and related sectors, and from 2005 began building housing independently. In 2012, Andrey became chairman of the board of directors of MIC Group, which is one of the top 3 property developers in "New Moscow"and Moscow Region and took 12th place in [[RBK Group|RBC]] magazine's TOP 30 ranking of Russia's biggest property developers in 2013&lt;ref&gt;[http://rway.ru/news/57768 ГК «МИЦ» вошла в список крупнейших девелоперов России // RWAY.Ru, 02.06.2014]&lt;/ref&gt;. 

==Sports Projects==

As a youth Andrey was keen on [[boxing]], in which he gained Candidate of Sport and Master of Sport qualifications. 

In 2012 and 2013, he was a General Partner of Khimki [[Basketball]] Club&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.sportbox.ru/Vidy_sporta/Basketbol/spbnews_NI355929_Sponsori-nachali-reshati-problemi-Himok Спонсоры начали решать проблемы «Химок» // Sportbox.ru]&lt;/ref&gt;.

Since 2012 he has been a Vice President of the Professional Boxing Federation of Russia.

On October 5, 2013, Andrey Ryabinskiy together with [[Rosneft]] organized a boxing match between [[Vladimir Klichko]] and [[Alexander Povetkin]] under the auspices of [[World Boxing Association|WBA]], [[World Boxing Organization|WBO]], [[International Boxing Federation|IBF]] and [[International Boxing Organization|IBO]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kommersant.ru/pda/kommersant.html?id=2178069 Бой для миллионов // «Коммерсантъ», 25.04.13]&lt;/ref&gt;. The budget for the Klichko vs. Povetkin fight was USD 25 million and the television rights were sold worldwide to broadcasters including RTL, HBO and Russia's Channel One. According to Ryabinskiy, it was not a commercial project for him: “I understand that when compared to the earnings, whatever I do I’m throwing my money down the drain by organizing this fight&lt;ref&gt;[http://sport.rbc.ru/news/177818/ А.Рябинский: Оплачиваем бой Поветкин — Кличко с «Роснефтью» равноправно и хотим показать его на Первом канале // «РБК-Спорт», 17.07.2013]&lt;/ref&gt;. But I just wanted to organize a world-class fight".

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6874">'''Bankruptcy prediction''' is the art of predicting [[bankruptcy]] and various measures of [[financial distress]] of public firms.  It is a vast area of finance and accounting research.  The importance of the area is due in part to the relevance for [[creditor]]s and [[investor]]s in evaluating the likelihood that a firm may go bankrupt.

The quantity of research is also a function of the availability of data: for public firms which went bankrupt or did not, numerous accounting ratios that might indicate danger can be calculated, and numerous other potential explanatory variables are also available.  Consequently, the area is well-suited for testing of increasingly sophisticated, data-intensive [[forecasting]] approaches.

==History==
The history of bankruptcy prediction includes application of numerous statistical tools which gradually became available, and involves deepening appreciation of various pitfalls in early analyses.  Research is still published that suffers pitfalls that have been understood for many years.

Bankruptcy prediction has been a subject of formal analysis since at least 1932, when FitzPatrick published a study of 20 pairs of firms, one failed and one surviving, matched by date, size and industry, in ''The Certified Public Accountant''.  He did not perform statistical analysis as is now common, but he thoughtfully interpreted the ratios and trends in the ratios.  His interpretation was effectively a complex, multiple variable analysis.

In 1967, [[William Beaver]] applied [[t-tests]] to evaluate the importance of individual accounting ratios within a similar pair-matched sample.

In 1968, in the first formal multiple variable analysis, [[Edward I. Altman]] applied [[multiple discriminant analysis]] within a pair-matched sample.  One of the most prominent early models of bankruptcy prediction is the [[Altman Z-score]], which is still applied today.

In 1980, [[James Ohlson]] applied [[logit regression]] in a much larger sample that did not involve pair-matching.

==Modern methods==
{{unreferenced section|date=February 2014}}
Survival methods are now applied.

Option valuation approaches involving stock price variability have been developed. Under structural models,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.fields.utoronto.ca/programs/scientific/09-10/finance/courses/hurdnotes2.pdf|title=Structural Modes of Credit Risk|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; a default event is deemed to occur for a firm when its assets reach a sufficiently low level compared to its liabilities.

[[Neural network model]]s and other sophisticated models have been tested on bankruptcy prediction.

Modern methods applied by business information companies surpass the annual accounts content and also consider current events like age, judgements, bad press, payment incidents and payment experiences from creditors.

==Comparison of differing approaches ==

The latest research within the field of Bankruptcy and Insolvency Prediction compares various differing approaches, modelling techniques, and individual models to ascertain whether any one technique is superior to its counterparts.

Jackson and Wood (2013) provides an excellent discussion of the literature to date, including an empirical evaluation of 15 popular models from the existing literature. These models range from the univariate models of Beaver through the multidimensional models of Altman and Ohlson, and continuing to more recent techniques which include option valuation approaches. They find that models based on market data  - such as an option valuation approach - outperform those earlier models which rely heavily on accounting numbers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | url = http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0890838913000498 | doi=10.1016/j.bar.2013.06.009 | volume=45 | title=The performance of insolvency prediction and credit risk models in the UK: A comparative study | journal=The British Accounting Review | pages=183–202}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Zhang, Wang, and Ji (2013) proposed a novel [[rule-based system]] to solve bankruptcy prediction problem. The whole procedure consists of the following four stages: first, sequential [[forward selection]] was used to extract the most important features; second, a rule-based model was chosen to fit the given dataset since it can present physical meaning; third, a genetic [[ant colony algorithm]] (GACA) was introduced; the fitness scaling strategy and the chaotic operator were incorporated with GACA, forming a new algorithm—fitness-scaling chaotic GACA (FSCGACA), which was used to seek the optimal parameters of the rule-based model; and finally, the [[Cross-validation_(statistics)#k-fold_cross-validation|stratified K-fold cross-validation]] technique was used to enhance the generalization of the model.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Zhang|first=Yudong|author2=Shuihua Wang |author3=Genlin Ji |title=A Rule-Based Model for Bankruptcy Prediction Based on an Improved Genetic Ant Colony Algorithm|journal=Mathematical Problems in Engineering|date=2013|volume=2013|doi=10.1155/2013/753251|url=http://downloads.hindawi.com/journals/mpe/2013/753251.pdf|page=753251}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Commercial insolvency in Canada''' has options and procedures that are distinct from those available in consumer [[insolvency]] proceedings. It is governed by the following statutes:

:* The ''[[Bankruptcy and Insolvency Act]]'' ("BIA") &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Bankruptcy and Insolvency Act (R.S.C., 1985, c. B-3) | url = http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/B-3/index.html | accessdate = 2011-08-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;
:* The ''[[Companies' Creditors Arrangement Act]]'' ("CCAA") &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Companies' Creditors Arrangement Act (R.S.C., 1985, c. C-36) | url = http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/C-36/index.html | accessdate = 2011-08-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;
:* The ''[[Winding-Up and Restructuring Act]]'' &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Winding-up and Restructuring Act (R.S.C., 1985, c. W-11) | url = http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/W-11/index.html | accessdate = 2011-08-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The following discussion concentrates on insolvency as it applies to corporations, but the rules apply to individuals and other entities involved in commercial matters as well, with necessary modifications.

==Financial difficulties prior to insolvency==

Provincial legislation under the [[property and civil rights]] power of the [[Constitution Act, 1867]] regulates the resolution of financial difficulties that occur before the onset of insolvency, and the BIA incorporates many of them by reference in the application of its provisions. Notable legislation is in effect for governing:

:* absconding debtors&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Absconding Debtors Act (Ontario), R.S.O. 1990, c. A.2 | url = http://www.e-laws.gov.on.ca/html/statutes/english/elaws_statutes_90a02_e.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;
:* [[fraudulent conveyance]]s&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Fraudulent Conveyances Act (Ontario), R.S.O. 1990, c. F.29 | url = http://www.e-laws.gov.on.ca/html/statutes/english/elaws_statutes_90f29_e.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;
:* relief of creditors&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Creditors’ Relief Act, 2010 (Ontario) , S.O. 2010, c. 16, Sch. 4 | url = http://www.e-laws.gov.on.ca/html/statutes/english/elaws_statutes_10c16b_e.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;
:* seizure of assets&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Execution Act (Ontario), R.S.O. 1990, c. E.24 | url = http://www.e-laws.gov.on.ca/html/statutes/english/elaws_statutes_90e24_e.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As well, corporate directors have a statutory duty of loyalty to the corporation and a duty of care to all of its stakeholders. It follows that directors have a duty to ensure that their corporation carries on business only if it can meet its liabilities as they become due and if there is a reasonable expectation of newly incurred obligations being satisfied.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|author = Scott Bomhof, [[Torys LLP]]|title = Duties of Directors in the Insolvency Zone | url = http://www.torys.com/Publications/Documents/Publication%20PDFs/AR2010-24.pdf|accessdate = 2011-12-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Alternatives to resolving financial difficulties==

Where a commercial debtor is experiencing financial difficulties, it is generally in his best interests to work with the secured lenders.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|author = D. Robb English, Paul Bowers and David Carson |title = Turnarounds: Dealing with the Secured Lender | url= http://www.airdberlis.com/Templates/Articles/articleFiles/315/Turnaround_seminar.pdf | publisher = Aird &amp; Berlis | date = 2004-09-27 | accessdate = 2011-09-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; The following options may be considered in order to seek a resolution to the matter:

:* informal compromise with creditors
:* out-of court [[restructuring|restructuring agreements]] &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|author = Milly Chow |title = Out-of-Court Restructurings | url= http://www.blakes.com/english/view_bulletin.asp?ID=4342 | publisher = [[Blake, Cassels &amp; Graydon]] | date = 2010-11-16 | accessdate = 2011-09-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;
:* plans of arrangement under the [[Canada Business Corporations Act]] or similar provincial corporations legislation &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = CBCA, S. 192 | url = http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/C-44/page-64.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Policy Concerning Arrangements Under Section 192 of the CBCA | url= https://www.ic.gc.ca/eic/site/cd-dgc.nsf/eng/cs01073.html | publisher = Industry Canada | date = 2010-01-04 | accessdate = 2011-09-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | author = Peter Rubin |title = Arrangement Provisions of the Canada Business Corporations Act | url= http://www.blakes.com/english/view_bulletin.asp?ID=4341 | publisher = [[Blake, Cassels &amp; Graydon]] | date = 2010-11-16 | accessdate = 2011-09-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Restructuring Under the Business Corporations Act | url= http://www.fmc-law.com/upload/en/publications/Restructuring%20Under%20the%20Business%20Corporations%20Act_Sept09.pdf | publisher = [[Fraser Milner Casgrain]] | date = September 2009 | accessdate = 2011-09-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;
:* the debtor making an assignment for the general benefit of creditors under the pertinent provincial legislation &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Assignments and Preferences Act (Ontario), R.S.O. 1990, c. A.33 | url= http://www.e-laws.gov.on.ca/html/statutes/english/elaws_statutes_90a33_e.htm | accessdate = 2011-09-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;
:* the creditor(s) securing appointment of a [[Receivership|receiver or interim receiver]] to seize and administer any of the debtor's property &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web| author = Aubrey E. Kaufman and R. Graham Phoenix |title = Interim Receivers under the BIA: What practicality demands ... for now | url = http://www.fasken.com/files/Publication/b2d58d89-0bad-44a6-97b2-14f728357d13/Presentation/PublicationAttachment/85794bc1-84d1-4461-8af8-2521f3590497/Interim_Receivers_Under_the_BIA.pdf| publisher = [[Fasken Martineau]] | date = 2007-10-31 | accessdate = 2011-09-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;
:* the debtor making a proposal to creditors (known as a "Division I proposal") &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Process for Division I Proposals | url = http://www.ic.gc.ca/eic/site/bsf-osb.nsf/eng/br02052.html | publisher = OSB | accessdate = 2011-08-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;
:* the debtor making an application under the CCAA to make a compromise or arrangement with its creditors &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = The Companies' Creditors Arrangement Act | url = http://www.ic.gc.ca/eic/site/bsf-osb.nsf/eng/br02284.html | publisher = OSB | accessdate = 2011-08-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;
:* an insolvent debtor making an assignment under the BIA for the general benefit of his creditors&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = BIA, S. 49 | url = http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/B-3/page-23.html#h-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;
:* creditors applying for a bankruptcy order where the debtor owes at least $1,000 and has committed an act of bankruptcy

All options other than the first four have the effect of staying any proceedings that can be brought against the debtor.

Insolvent persons have the choice of making an assignment immediately, or to seek protection from creditors in order to reorganize their affairs and continue as a going concern. For the latter option, companies owing less than $5 million generally opt to file a Division I proposal, while those owing more can also opt for the CCAA proceeding.

==Entities subject to insolvency regime==

With certain exceptions, the ''BIA'' covers a wide range of entities:

:* it covers anyone who has resided or carried on business in Canada
:* it "includes a partnership, an unincorporated association, a corporation, a cooperative society or a cooperative organization, the successors of a partnership, of an association, of a corporation, of a society or of an organization and the heirs, executors, liquidators of the succession, administrators or other legal representatives of a person;"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = BIA, S. 2, definition of "person" | url = http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/B-3/page-1.html#h-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; but

==Settlement of the insolvent person's estate==

The trustee/receiver/monitor must first realize the amount of the proceeds from the property that is available for payment to the different classes of creditors, and different rules apply according to the type of proceeding. They are summarized as follows:

The estate is then settled, using the priority of claims outlined in the [[Bankruptcy and Insolvency Act|BIA]].

==Creation of security interests==

It is in the lender's or supplier's best interest to minimize his financial exposure should his client experience financial difficulties. To that end, there is a range of remedies available to establish his status as a secured (vs unsecured) creditor under both provincial and federal legislation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |author = John R. Sandrelli, Christopher J. Ramsay and Anjili I.

In the [[common law]] provinces, security interests are created through the registration of [[mortgage law|mortgages and charges]] against the real property concerned. In Quebec, this is done by way of [[hypothec]]s against immoveable property.

For personal property (moveable property in Quebec), secured creditors create their security interests through registration under the ''[[Personal Property Security Act (Canada)|Personal Property Security Act]]'' ("PPSA") in force in their province, or under the ''[[Civil Code of Quebec|Civil Code]]'' in Quebec by way of [[hypothec]] through the ''Registre des droits personnels et réels mobiliers''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|author = Kiriakoula Hatzikiriako |title = An attempt to "demystify" Québec secured transactions law (Part I) | url= http://www.mcmillan.ca/Files/ARTICLE_An%20attempt%20to%20demystify_ABA_E_0610.pdf | publisher = ABA Commercial Law Newsletter as reprinted by [[McMillan LLP]] | date = Summer 2010 | accessdate = 2011-09-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Registre des droits personnels et réels mobiliers | url= http://www.justice.gouv.qc.ca/english/programmes/rdprm-a.htm| accessdate = 2011-09-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; Banks can also create security interests under SS. 426-427 of the [[Canada Bank Act|Bank Act]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Bank Act (S.C. 1991, c. 46), S. 426 | url = http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/B-1.01/page-125.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Bank Act (S.C. 1991, c. 46), S. 427 | url = http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/B-1.01/page-126.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; which normally have priority over PPSA registrations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|author = Rebecca M. Morse |title = Priority Disputes between the Bank Act and Provincial PPSA Legislation | url= http://www.farris.com/images/uploads/RMM_-_Article_-_Priority_Disputes_Between_the_Bank_Act_and_Provincial_PPSA_Legislation.pdf | publisher = Farris, Vaughan, Wills &amp; Murphy LLP | accessdate = 2011-09-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, as noted by the [[Supreme Court of Canada]] in ''[[Bank of Montreal v. Innovation Credit Union]]'', with regard to unperfected security interests, this depends on the provisions of the PPSA in effect in the province concerned.

There can be complex interplay between insolvency law and other legal regimes, such as [[admiralty law]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|author = Robert A. Margolis and Christopher J. Giaschi |title = Priorities and Bankruptcy in Admiralty | url= http://www.admiraltylaw.com/papers/bankruptcy.pdf | date = April 2002 | accessdate = 2011-09-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[common law]] provinces and territories, legislation in place for specific security interests is as follows:

==Debtor protection provisions==

===Stay of proceedings===
No person may terminate or amend — or claim an accelerated payment or forfeiture of the term under — any agreement, including a security agreement, with a bankrupt individual by reason only of the individual's bankruptcy or insolvency.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = BIA, S. 84.2 | url = http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/B-3/page-63.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similar provision is made with respect to any insolvent person upon filing a notice of intention or a proposal,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = BIA, S. 65.1 | url = http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/B-3/page-33.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as for any debtor company subject to the CCAA by reason only that proceedings commenced under the CCA or that the company is insolvent.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = CCAA, S. 34(1) | url = http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/C-36/page-20.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because of these restrictions on what are called ''"ipso facto"'' clauses, creditors must be careful in specifying appropriate trigger events in their contracts' termination clauses.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web| author = Stephen J. Weisz |title = Insolvency and Restructuring Agreements in an Economic Downturn | url = http://www.blakes.com/english/publications/RI/pdf/Paper139.pdf | publisher = [[Blake, Cassels &amp; Graydon]] | date = April 2009 | accessdate = 2011-09-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Canadian courts have extended this further through application of the common law principle of [[anti-deprivation rule|fraud upon the bankruptcy law]], declaring that termination clauses that are triggered where non-payment of obligations is indirectly caused by the debtor's insolvency should be deemed to have been caused by the insolvency.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title = Beware Contractual Provisions triggered (even indirectly) by a Party's Insolvency|author = Anthony Alexander|url = http://www.canadianappeals.com/2013/03/06/the-second-opinion-beware-contractual-provisions-triggered-by-a-partys-insolvency/|date = 2013-06-06|publisher = [[McCarthy Tétrault]]|accessdate = 2013-11-04}}, discussing {{cite CanLII|litigants=Aircell Communications Inc. v.

A notice of intention &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = BIA, S. 50.4 | url = http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/B-3/page-25.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; or a Division I proposal &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = BIA, S. 62(1) | url = http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/B-3/page-30.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; will automatically create a stay of proceedings and "no creditor has any remedy against the debtor or the debtor's property, or shall commence or continue any action, execution or other proceedings, for the recovery of a claim provable in bankruptcy". Similar provision is also made on the bankruptcy of any debtor.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = BIA, S. 69.3 | url = http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/B-3/page-51.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; Directors of insolvent companies that have filed a notice of intention or a proposal have similar protection.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = BIA, S. 69.31 | url = http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/B-3/page-52.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Suspension of attachments===

S. 70(1) of the ''BIA'' provides that bankruptcy orders and assignments take precedence over "all judicial or other attachments, garnishments, certificates having the effect of judgments, judgments, certificates of judgment, legal hypothecs of judgment creditors, executions or other process against the property of a bankrupt,"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = BIA, S. 70 | url = http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/B-3/section-70.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; but that does not extend to:

:* those that have been completely executed by payment to the creditor or the creditor's representative, or
:* the rights of a secured creditor.

The [[Ontario Court of Appeal]] has ruled that, in the case of a "requirement to pay" under the ''Income Tax Act'' (Canada) that was issued after a notice of application to appoint a receiver (but before the court heard the application), supported by an ''[[ex parte]]'' "jeopardy order" issued by the [[Federal Court (Canada)|Federal Court of Canada]] under s. 225.1(1) of that Act,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title = ''Income Tax Act'', R.S.C., 1985, c. 1 (5th Supp.), s. 225.1(1)|url = http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/I-3.3/section-225.1.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; the "requirement to pay" was considered to have been completely executed on the date of its issue, and thus took precedence over other creditors' claims.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite CanLII|litigants=I.

===Contractual arrangements===

Contracts may be assigned elsewhere in the event of a notice of intention of a Division I proposal,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = BIA, S. 66(1.1) | url = http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/B-3/page-37.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; bankruptcy&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = BIA, S. 84.1 | url = http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/B-3/page-63.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; or CCAA proceeding.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = CCAA, S. 11.3 | url = http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/C-36/page-9.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; Agreements of any kind can be disclaimed in the event of a Division I proposal&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = BIA, S. 65.11 | url = http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/B-3/page-34.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; or CCAA proceeding,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = CCAA, S. 32 | url = http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/C-36/page-19.html#h-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as leases in a bankruptcy proceeding.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = BIA, S. 30(1)(k) | url = http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/B-3/page-15.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Critical suppliers may be ordered to continue dealing with companies undergoing a CCAA proceeding, if the goods or services supplied are critical to the company's continued operation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = CCAA, S. 11.4 | url = http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/C-36/page-9.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Anti-avoidance provisions==

===Attacking questionable behaviour===

As in other countries, certain debtors may be tempted to bypass the process outlined above through the transfer of assets from an insolvent company to a [[phoenix company]], thus abandoning outstanding liabilities to creditors. Recent legal developments have made this procedure unattractive, through creditors using the [[oppression remedy]] available under the CBCA and similar provincial corporations legislation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web| author = Mark Wiffen |title = getting blood from a stone – enforcing unpaid corporate judgments against directors | url = http://www.mcmillan.ca/95997 | publisher = [[McMillan LLP]] | date = July 2011 | accessdate = 2011-09-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Several procedures are available for investigating companies' behaviour during times of insolvency or other financial difficulty. The BIA provides for examination of relevant parties during the administration of the estate,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = BIA, SS. 161-167 | url = http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/B-3/page-85.html#h-47 | accessdate = 2011-09-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the CBCA and similar provincial corporations legislation provides for the court to appoint inspectors to investigate and report back on fraudulent, dishonest, oppressive or unfairly prejudicial behaviour of a corporation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = CBCA, Part XIX | url = http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/C-44/page-74.html#h-27 | accessdate = 2011-09-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web| author = Edmond F.B.

The court has power to remove one or more of the company's directors, if the court is satisfied that the director is unreasonably impairing or is likely to unreasonably impair the possibility of a viable proposal (or in the case of the CCAA, a compromise or arrangement) being made in respect of the company or is acting or is likely to act inappropriately as a director in the circumstances.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = BIA, s. 64 | url = http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/B-3/page-31.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = CCAA, s. 11.5 | url = http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/C-36/page-10.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Protection of creditors===

Where bankruptcy is sought, it does not necessarily wipe the slate clean on certain debts. Some liabilities are not released upon discharge.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = BIA, S. 178(1) | url = http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/B-3/page-93.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; Directors and parties related to the bankrupt may still be held personally liable for certain tax debts,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web| author = Katherine M.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4775">'''Corporate transparency''' describes the extent to which a corporation's actions are observable by outsiders. This is a consequence of regulation, local norms, and the set of information, privacy, and business policies concerning corporate decision-making and operations openness to employees, [[Stakeholder (corporate)|stakeholders]], shareholders and the general public. From the perspective of outsiders, transparency can be defined simply as the perceived quality of intentionally shared information from the corporation.&lt;ref name='JOM'/&gt; 

Recent research suggests there are three primary dimensions of corporate transparency: information disclosure, clarity, and accuracy.&lt;ref name='JOM'&gt;Schnackenberg, A., Tomlinson, E., 2014. Organizational Transparency: A New Perspective on Managing Trust in Organization-Stakeholder Relationships. ''Journal of Management'' DOI: 10.1177/0149206314525202. http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0149206314525202&lt;/ref&gt; To increment transparency, corporations infuse greater disclosure, clarity, and accuracy into their communications with stakeholders. For example, governance decisions to voluntarily share information related to the firm's ecological impact with environmental activists indicate disclosure; decisions to actively limit the use of [[technical terminology]], [[fine print]], or complicated mathematical notations in the firm's correspondence with suppliers and customers indicate clarity; and decisions to not bias, embellish, or otherwise distort known facts in the firm's communications with investors indicate accuracy. The ''strategic'' management of transparency therefore involves intentional modifications in disclosure, clarity, and accuracy to accomplish the firm's objectives.&lt;ref name='JOM'/&gt; 

[[Standard &amp; Poor's]] has included a definition of corporate transparency in its [http://www2.standardandpoors.com/portal/site/sp/en/ap/page.product/equityresearch_gamma/2,5,13,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0.html GAMMA Methodology] aimed at analysis and assessment of [[corporate governance]]. As a part of this work, Standard &amp; Poor's Governance Services publishes the Transparency Index which calculates the average score for the largest public companies in various countries.

[[Transparency International]] publishes an index of [http://www.transparency.org/news/feature/shining-a-light-on-the-worlds-biggest-companies corporate transparency] based on public disclosure of anti-corruption programmes and country-by-country reporting. Corporate transparency is also used to refer to radical transparency in corporate governance.{{citation needed|date=January 2016}} Transparency Index calculated as the average score for the largest public companies in various countries.

== Customer support transparency ==
{{Main article|Customer engagement}}

Corporations may be transparent to investors, the public at large, and to customers.

Opening up the customer support channels may mean using a feedback tool which allows users to publicly vote on new developments, having an open [[internet forum]], or actively responding to social media questions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/media-network/media-network-blog/2012/mar/02/customer-service-social-rules|title=The new, social rules of customer service|last=Norris|first=Jon|date=2012-03-02|newspaper=The Guardian|language=en-GB|issn=0261-3077|access-date=2016-10-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Cubes''' is a light-weight [[open-source software|open source]] multidimensional modelling and [[OLAP]] toolkit for development reporting applications and browsing of aggregated data written in [[Python Programming Language|Python programming language]] released under the [[MIT License]].

Cubes provides to an analyst or any application end-user "understandable and natural way of reporting using concept of [[OLAP cube|data Cubes]] – multidimensional data objects".

Cubes was first publicly released in March 2011. The project was originally developed for [[Government procurement|Public Procurements]] of [[Slovakia]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://tender.sme.sk/ Public Procurements of Slovakia] by [http://www.transparency.sk Transparency International Slovakia]&lt;/ref&gt; Cubes 1.0 was released in September 2014 and presented on the PyData Conference in New York&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-FDTK80zsXc&amp;spfreload=10 Cubes 1.0 Overview at PyData NYC 2014 (video)].&lt;/ref&gt;

== Features ==
* [[OLAP]] and aggregated browsing (default is ROLAP)
* logical model of [[OLAP cube]]s in [[JSON]] or provided from external sources
* hierarchical dimensions (attributes that have hierarchical dependencies, such as category-subcategory or country-region)
* multiple hierarchies in a dimension
* [[Expression (mathematics)|arithmetic expressions]] for computing derived [[Measure (data warehouse)|measures]] and aggregates
* [[Internationalization and localization|localizable]] metadata and data

== Model ==
The logical conceptual model in Cubes is described using [[JSON]] and can be provided either in a form of a file, directory bundle or from an external model provider (for example a database). The basic model objects are: [[OLAP cube|cubes]] and their measures and aggregates, dimensions and their attributes, hierarchies. Logical model also contains mapping from logical attributes to their physical location in a database (or other data source).

Example model:

&lt;syntaxhighlight lang="javascript"&gt;
{
    "cubes": [
        {
            "name": "sales",
            "label": "Our Sales",
            "dimensions": [ "date", "customer", "location", "product" ],
            "measures": [ "amount" ]
        }
    ]
    "dimensions": [
        {
            "name": "product",
            "label": "Product",
            "levels": [
                {
                    "name":"category",
                    "label":"Category",
                    "attributes": [ "category_id", "category_label" ],
                },
                {
                    "name":"product",
                    "label":"Product",
                    "attributes": [ "product_id", "product_label" ],
                }
            ]
        },
        ...
    ]
}
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;

== Operations ==
Cubes provides basic set of operations such as [[Data drilling]] and filtering ([[OLAP cube|slicing and dicing]]). The operations can be accessed either through Python interface or through a light [[web server]] called Slicer.

Example of the python interface:

&lt;syntaxhighlight lang="python"&gt;
import cubes

workspace = Workspace("slicer.ini")
browser = workspace.browser("sales")

result = browser.aggregate()

print(result.summary)
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;

== Server ==
The Cubes provides a non-traditional OLAP server with [[HTTP]] queries and [[JSON]] response [[API]]. Example query to get "total amount of all contracts between January 2012 and June 2016 by month":

&lt;tt&gt;
&lt;nowiki&gt;http://localhost:5000/cube/contracts/aggregate?drilldown=date&amp;drilldown=criteria&amp;cut=date:2012,1-2012,6&amp;order=date.month:desc&lt;/nowiki&gt;
&lt;/tt&gt;

The response looks like:

&lt;syntaxhighlight lang="javascript"&gt;
{
    "summary": {
        "contract_amount_sum": 10000000.0
    },
    "remainder": {},
    "cells": [
        {
            "date.year": 2012,
            "criteria.code": "ekonaj",
            "contract_amount_sum": 12345.0,
            "criteria.description": "economically best offer",
            "criteria.sdesc": "best offer",
            "criteria.id": 3
        },
        {
            "date.year": 2012,
            "criteria.code": "cena",
            "contract_amount_sum": 23456.0,
            "criteria.description": "lowest price",
            "criteria.sdesc": "lowest price",
            "criteria.id": 4
        },
...
    "total_cell_count": 6,
    "aggregates": [
        "contract_amount_sum"
    ],
    "cell": [
        {
            "type": "range",
            "dimension": "date",
            "hierarchy": "default",
            "level_depth": 2,
            "invert": false,
            "hidden": false,
            "from": ["2012", "1" ],
            "to": ["2015", "6" ]
        }
    ],
    "levels": {
        "criteria": [ "criteria" ],
        "date": [ "year" ]
    }
}
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;

The simple HTTP/JSON interface makes it very easy to integrate OLAP reports in web applications written in pure [[HTML]] and [[JavaScript]].

The Slicer server contains endpoints describing the [[OLAP cube|cube]] metadata which helps to create generic reporting applications&lt;ref&gt;[https://github.com/jjmontesl/cubesviewer Cubes Viewer]&lt;/ref&gt; that don't have to know the database model structure and conceptual hierarchies up-in-front.

The Slicer server is written using the [[Flask (web framework)]].

== ROLAP and SQL ==
The built-in [[SQL]] backend of the framework provides [[ROLAP]] functionality on top a relational database. Cubes contains a [[SQL]] query generator that translates the reporting queries into SQL statements. The query generator takes into account [[topology]] of the [[Star schema|star]] or [[snowflake schema]] and executes only joins that are necessary to retrieve attributes required by the data analyst.

The SQL backend uses [[SQLAlchemy]] Python toolkit to construct the queries.

*Sole proprietors  
*Partnerships
*[[Corporation]]s, associations and [[Trust company|trust]]s 
*Nonprofit and charitable estates 
*Organizations and [[joint ventures]] 
*[[Limited liability companies]].

People who employ household workers can include:

*Local chapters of college  
*Local college clubs
*[[Fraternities]] or [[sororities]].

==Registration in various countries==

==Venture Capital firm==
In a Venture Capital firm the entrepreneur is funded to work with some of the [[investment]] team of the company as well as being exposed to business-building processes, where he/she can assist the firm with any existing portfolio. In addition he/she is expected to help the company evaluate new potential investments, especially if it is an area of the E.I.R's experience. 
On the other hand, the company usually benefits from this by getting significant access to the new company started by the E.I.R. This is due to the fact that the company gets to, usually, be the first investor in E.I.R's new company, giving them a chance to influence some company decisions.&lt;ref&gt;Festanstellung - Entrepreneur in Residence (m/w) - München, Berlin - www.etventure.com, (2014).

==Law Firm==
In a law firm scenario, the [[entrepreneur]] is expected to provide services to the firm’s clients who are also involved in entrepreneur activity. 
For a firm having an entrepreneur who can interact with other entrepreneurs and advise them is a way of gaining client trust by helping them with business decisions and networks.
In addition Law firms can also have the previous E.I.Rs as their clients once they start up their company. This is an easy and accessible [[clientele]] with whom the companies had previous relationships. 
This is a very beneficial relationship for the E.I.R, who will develop relationships with several other entrepreneurs, that could be potential partners in the future. The E.I.R gets a chance to show his/her knowledge and understanding to the law firm's client and will develop further relationships with any partners of the client's partner as well.

==Business School==
While in a Business school, an E.I.R is expected to provide guidance to business students who are intending to go through the same path as those who are helping them. The type of nurturing an E.I.R can provide to a 
business school environment helps students, professors or whoever wishes to start a business within the institution environment. The E.I.R helps them develop ideas, organize them and follow the right path towards making these ideas reality.

{{eastern name order|Droppa György}}
'''György Droppa''' (born 17 September 1947) is a [[Hungary|Hungarian]] environmentalist, politician and economist, who served as leader of several extra-parliamentary green political parties since the 1990s.

==Early life==
After finishing university studies, Droppa started his career in the [[Catering|catering industry]], working for Panonnia, Danubius and Olimpia hotels. In 1982, he opened his first own restaurant (Fondue Bar) at the Keleti Károly St. which became a popular meeting place among the "democratic opposition" members who criticized the Communist regime. Droppa has enabled to extension of samizdat publications in his restaurant. By 1988, he established further three catering units (Katlan Club, Virányos Club and Jókai Club), where several opposition events and rallies took place. During the transition process, he was a founding member of the re-established Hungarian Catering Corporation.

In June 2009, the 1956 Institute claimed Droppa, as a member of the opposition party SZDSZ, was one of the state authority's 181 informer agents at the reburial of [[Imre Nagy]] and his martyr companions on 16 June 1989.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|accessdate=2015-11-26|url=http://www.rev.hu/89/f?p=107:17:8731514528777296:RESET_PAGINATION:NO:RP,17:P17_PERSON_ID,P16_PERSON_TYPE:13525,3|title=Droppa György ügynöki adatlapja|date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Droppa rejected the accusation and expressed the possibility of a lawsuit. Later János M. Rainer, head of the institute backtracked from their standpoint and stated "there is no evidence that the state security organs did indeed looking for him and Droppa handed over reports."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|accessdate=2015-11-26|url=http://index.hu/belfold/1989/2009/06/12/droppa_szerint_o_nem_jelentett_barandyt_megkerestek_ezzel-azzal/?cp=7#comments|title=Tagad a besúgólista több szereplője|date=2009-06-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Political career==
Droppa was one of the founders of the [[Duna Kör]] in 1984, which established as a protest body to prevent the construction of the [[Gabčíkovo–Nagymaros Dams]]. In 1990, he became chargé d'affaires of the organization. He joined the [[Alliance of Free Democrats]] (SZDSZ) for a short time in 1989. In November 1989, he participated in the foundation of the [[Green Party of Hungary]] (MZP). Following the radical right-wing ideological turnout within the party by 1993, Droppa and several other environmentalist members decided to quit the party to establish the [[Green Alternative (Hungary)|Green Alternative]] (ZA), with election of Droppa and [[Erzsébet Schmuck]] as its co-leaders. However the new party was unsuccessful at the [[Hungarian parliamentary election, 1994|1994 parliamentary election]], receiving only 0.02 percent of the votes.

In January 1994, the ZA was admitted into the [[European Federation of Green Parties]], which established under this name few months earlier. Despite the lack of domestic support, György Droppa was also elected to the European political party's leadership, holding his position as "key figure of the green politics" until 2009. In that capacity, Droppa established a good relationship with the [[GreenLeft]], a prominent Dutch member of the federation.{{sfn|Vida|2011|p=468}} Beside that, Droppa also served as Director of the ISTER – East European Environmental Research between 1993 and 1997. In September 1997, ZA joined the Union for Hungary electoral alliance, dominated by the [[Republican Party (Hungary)|Republican Party]], however it did not gain any seats in the [[Hungarian parliamentary election, 1998|1998 parliamentary election]]. Following the defeat, Droppa and Márta Márczis were elected co-presidents of the ZA.

On 3 June 2000, the ZA merged with the Social Democracy 2000 Foundation to form the [[Alliance of Green Democrats]] (ZDSZ).{{sfn|Vida|2011|p=467}} The ZDSZ joined the [[Centre Party (Hungary)|Centre Party]] (or Centrum), with Droppa elected to its leadership, for the [[Hungarian parliamentary election, 2002|2002 parliamentary election]], but remained unsuccessful.&lt;ref name=NS&gt;[[Dieter Nohlen|Nohlen, D]] &amp; Stöver, P (2010) ''Elections in Europe: A data handbook'', p. 899. {{ISBN|978-3-8329-5609-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[Hungarian local elections, 2002|2002 local elections]], Droppa was the Centrum's candidate for the position of [[Mayor of Budapest]], but received only 0.59 percent of the votes and came to the fifth place.{{sfn|Vida|2011|p=469}} On 16 November 2003, the ZDSZ transformed itself into a party alliance by merging several other minor movements. The Védegylet, the Clean Air Action Group and other environmentalist NGOs rejected Droppa's integration efforts. On 31 December 2004, the ZDSZ left the Centre Party.{{sfn|Vida|2011|p=470}} The party could run only one representative at the [[Hungarian parliamentary election, 2006|2006 parliamentary election]].

Droppa's leading role in the Hungarian section of the green movement had declined with the appearance and formation of the [[Politics Can Be Different]] (LMP). In reaction to this, the ZDSZ and the [[Workers' Party of Hungary 2006]], merged into the [[Green Left (Hungary)|Green Left]] and Droppa elected as its first president. However, despite the fact that LMP was not yet a member of the [[European Green Party]], its key leader [[Daniel Cohn-Bendit]] personally expressed his sympathy and support to the new green-liberal organization for the [[European Parliament election, 2009 (Hungary)|2009 European Parliament election]]. Cohn-Bendit said "I do not trust György Droppa anymore. For years, he keeps saying the same, and now it was enough. I do not see that there is a lot of chance to [Droppa] to take the necessary twenty thousand recommendation slips."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|accessdate=2015-11-26|url=http://magyarnarancs.hu/belpol/zoldpartok_magyarorszagon_-_orok_igeretek-71449|title=Zöldpártok Magyarországon - Örök ígéretek|date=2009-05-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cohn-Bendit also criticized Droppa for his party having merged with a Marxist movement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|accessdate=2015-11-26|url=http://blog.xfree.hu/myblog.tvn?n=zgfumag&amp;pid=35980&amp;blog_cim=%20%22El%20lehet%20t%E1vozni%20az%20EU-b%F3l%22|title=El lehet távozni az EU-ból|date=2009-05-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; While LMP jumped over the electoral threshold in the [[Hungarian parliamentary election, 2010|2010 parliamentary election]], Droppa's Green Left received only 0.03% of the votes. Following the election, Droppa was replaced as party president by neo-Marxist philosopher [[Gáspár Miklós Tamás]].{{sfn|Vida|2011|p=468}}

The '''Institute of Directors''' (IoD) is a business organisation for company directors, senior business leaders and entrepreneurs. It is the UK’s longest running organisation for professional leaders, having been founded in 1903 and incorporated by [[Royal Charter]] in 1906. The IoD, per its mission statement, stands for "[[free enterprise]], [[entrepreneurialism]], wealth creation and good [[corporate governance]]," and represents "the views of businesses and IoD members in the media and with government." {{Citation needed|date=August 2017}}

The IoD is located in the [[Listed building|Grade I-listed building]] at 116 Pall Mall, formerly the [[United Service Club]]. Members of the IoD also gain access to co-working spaces around the UK, bespoke market intelligence, tailored tax and legal support, exclusive member-only events along with discounts on IoD professional development courses and events.

From a high of 55,000 members in 2005, the IoD currently has just over 30,000 full members. Members of the IoD come from companies of all sizes and from all industries {{Citation needed|date=August 2017}}. Around 70% work for small and medium-sized enterprises and are typically in senior management and boardroom-level positions while 78% of [[FTSE 100 Index|FTSE 100]] companies have an IoD member on their board or in a senior management position.

==History &amp; Royal Charter==

The IoD was founded in 1903 and incorporated by royal charter in 1906.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iod.com/about-the-iod/our-royal-charter IoD Royal Charter] Retrieved 29 June 2015&lt;/ref&gt; The royal charter compels the IoD to:

* Promote for the public benefit high levels of skill, knowledge, professional competence and integrity on the part of directors
* Represent the interests of members and the business community to government and in the public arena
* Encourage and foster a climate favourable to entrepreneurial activity and wealth creation
* Promote the study, research and development of corporate governance

==Membership==

The IoD represents individual members. Every member’s voice carries equal weight within the organisation, and members retain their membership of the IoD throughout their career. This allows the IoD free rein to speak out on behalf of the business community and discuss individual companies in public.

There are currently 30,000 IoD members in the UK and Overseas, with an additional 2,500 student members. Anybody who has an interest in business, is running a business, sits on a board or runs their own company can join the IoD.

In order to help address declining membership the IoD 99 was established in 2015.  This initiative is aimed at members who under the age of 42, and gives a substantial discount on membership fees.  Additionally IoD Advance was launched in March 2016, which gives additional benefits in return for a higher annual subscription.

==Policy==

The IoD represents its members and makes the case for enterprise, entrepreneurialism and business in the public and to government. Working with various stakeholders, the IoD campaigns on issues of importance to its members and the wider business community to build an environment in the UK which supports businesses and makes is easy to start, grow and run a company.

The IoD has experts on tax, infrastructure, law, Europe, corporate governance, financial services, technology, education, skills and regulation, and campaigns on all of these issues.

==Business support==

The IoD’s Information and Advisory Services offer members tailored and bespoke business advice on all aspects of running a business, including unbiased and confidential legal, financial, HR, marketing, and tax support. Members of the IoD can access the support through online, telephone or face-to-face consultations, are allowed up to 25 different consultations each year.

==Training and development==

The IoD is one of the country’s most prestigious training providers, and has a range of courses to suit business leaders at every stage of their career. There are role-specific training courses to equip directors with new skills to take on different roles along with the flagship Chartered Director course. [In other countries Certified Director, e.G. in [http://german-iod.org/ablauf/ Germany]]

Training courses are open to both members and non-members alike, and around 5,000 people take part in an IoD course every year. The IoD networks also provide executive coaching, mentoring services and online learning zones.

==Initiatives and events==

The IoD hosts hundreds of networking, policy and social events throughout the year and across the country.

===Annual Convention===

[[Image:Julia Gillard Mackworth 2015.jpg|thumb|right|[[Julia Gillard]] delivers the inaugural Mackworth Lecture at the IoD, 2015]]

The Annual Convention is the flagship IoD event and a fixture of the business calendar and has historically taken place at the [[Royal Albert Hall]] each year. It draws some of the biggest business names and politicians and leaders from across the world. The convention has taken place every year since 1950. Nine different prime ministers have addressed the convention on more than eighteen occasions along with pioneers such as [[Jimmy Wales]], co-founder of [[Wikipedia]], and [[Richard Branson]], serial entrepreneur, and members of the British royal family, including the [[Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh]] and the [[Charles, Prince of Wales]]. The last Annual Convention took place in September 2016 and included former Greece finance minister [[Yanis Varoufakis]], Lord [[Norman Lamont]] of Lerwick, global economist [[Dambisa Moyo]], and [[Nicola Sturgeon]].

Owing to declining ticket and sponsorship revenues the Annual Convention took a year's break in 2017.  It will take on a new look in March 2018, with the format and speaker line-up to be confirmed.

===Rhondda Lecture===

In 2015, the IoD launched the annual Rhondda Lecture, in honour of Viscountess Rhondda, the first female President of the IoD. The lecture celebrates radical thought, leadership, bold ideas and activism. [[Julia Gillard]], former Australian prime minister delivered the inaugural lecture in June 2015 at 116 Pall Mall to an audience of politicians, academics, and business leaders. [[Ruth Davidson]], leader of the Scottish Conservative party, gave the 2016 lecture and was interviewed by BBC journalist [[Laura Kuenssberg]] at 116 Pall Mall in December.

==''Director'' magazine==

''Director'' is a business and lifestyle magazine for business leaders. It is circulated bi-monthly, is free to IoD members and available to purchase through subscription. It contains interviews with business leaders and politicians, updates from the IoD, debates on topical issues, reviews and features.  In April 2017 it was announced that the editorial, advertising and production functions of the magazine will be transferred over to SevenC3, a contract publisher.  As a result, a number of members of staff were made redundant.  This was followed by an announcement in October 2017 that the magazine would be cut back to only six issues per year.

==Structure &amp; key people==

The IoD is made up of regional divisions and branches across the UK which serve as the local point of contact for IoD members. At the national level, the IoD is governed by a board and a council, which serves as the voice of IoD members.

Stephen Martin is the director general, having succeeded [[Simon Walker (business)|Simon Walker]] in October 2016.

[[Barbara, Lady Judge]]&lt;!--her name as listed in the official London Gazette on 12 June 2010 when she received her CBE--&gt; became the IoD's first female chairman in May 2015. She promised to champion women and work to boost the number of women in senior executive positions across British business.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/946a13d4-ce5f-11e4-900c-00144feab7de.html Lady Judge stirs things up at the UK’s Institute of Directors] Retrieved 29 June 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; In September 2018, it was announced that she would be succeeded by [[Charlotte Valeur]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/sep/02/institute-of-directors-appoints-charlotte-valeur-as-chair|title=Charlotte Valeur succeeds Barbara Judge as IoD chair|first=Rupert|last=Jones|date=2 September 2018|website=the Guardian|accessdate=2 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Internationally there are different organizations with the same target. In Germany, the [[ Deutsches Institut der Aufsichtsräte]] exists as an active non profit organization.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://german-iod.org|title=Deutsches Institut der Aufsichtsräte|author=|date=|website=Deutsches Institut der Aufsichtsräte|accessdate=2 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==116 Pall Mall==

The IoD occupy the Grade I listed 116 Pall Mall in London, which is open to members of the IoD, and has rooms and function suites available for commercial hire. The building is owned by the [[Crown Estate]], along with the large collection of artwork that decorates the rooms. Until 1978, the building was run by the [[United Services Club]]. The building was designed by [[John Nash (architect)|John Nash]], the 19th-century architect who also designed the [[Brighton Pavilion]] and [[Marble Arch]], and constructed between 1826-28.

Between 2001 and 2014, members also had use of 123 Pall Mall. This was opened as a contemporary meeting space in contrast with the more traditional 116 Pall Mall, and the interiors were created by noted designers Wayne and Geraldine Hemingway. Despite its popularity with members, the building was closed in 2014 as part of cost saving measures.

116 Pall Mall has been used as a location for many films and TV programmes, including ''[[Gandhi (film)|Gandhi]]'', ''[[Foyle's War]]'', "[[Downton Abbey]]", "[[The Ali G Show]]", "[[Parks and Recreation]]" and ''[[The Dark Knight (film)|The Dark Knight]]''.

'''ICMA''' (International City/County Management Association) (originally International City Managers' Association)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://etext.ku.edu/view?docId=ksrlead/ksrl.kc.internationalcitycounty.xml;route=ksrlead;brand=ksrlead;query= |title= Guide to the ICMA Collection - International City/County Management Association records, 1900-2010 |publisher= University of Kansas Libraries |date= 2010 |accessdate= June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; is an association representing professionals in [[local government]] management. It is based in [[Washington, D.C.]], [[United States|USA]].

Founded in 1914 as the International City Managers Association, ICMA provides education and networking opportunities for its members, and offers the Credentialed Manager program to offer professional [[credential]]ing to [[city manager|city and county executive managers]]. It also conducts research, provides technical assistance and training, and promotes professional local government management.&lt;ref name="icma"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://icma.org/main/bc.asp?bcid=60&amp;hsid=1&amp;ssid1=17|title=About ICMA|accessdate=2008-12-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ICMA Voluntary Credentialing Program recognizes professional local government managers qualified by a combination of education and experience, adherence to high standards of integrity, and an assessed commitment to lifelong learning and professional development. Managers are recognized by ICMA through a peer review credentialing process, and this self-directed program offers an opportunity for interested ICMA members to quantify the unique expertise they bring to their communities. The program also assists ICMA members in focusing and reflecting upon their lifelong professional development experience. Members who participate in the program may earn the designation of ICMA Credentialed Manager granted by the ICMA Executive Board.

The ICMA is considered part of the '[[Big Seven (United States)|Big Seven]]', a group of organisations that represent local and state government in the United States.

The '''Koreatown Immigrant Workers Alliance 한인타운 노동연대''' ('''KIWA''', pronounced kee-wah), also known under its past name '''Korean Immigrant Workers Advocates 남가주 한인 노동 상담소''', is a multi-ethnic [[foreign worker|immigrant worker]] [[civil rights]] [[membership organization]] based in the [[Los Angeles]] [[Koreatown, Los Angeles, California|Koreatown]] area.

KIWA was founded in 1992 by progressive minded Korean activists who saw [[social class|class]] as the basic contradiction of the immigrant communities  in [[Koreatown, Los Angeles, California|Koreatown]]. It has since been involved in the aftermath of the [[1992 Los Angeles Civil Unrest]], campaigns to improve working conditions and immigrant worker empowerment in various Korean ethnic industries, the [[living wage]]s campaign, and Koreatown's multi-ethnic community developments.

KIWA is perhaps best known recently for its long campaign against Assi Market, the largest ethnic Korean-owned supermarket of the [[United States]], located in Koreatown. Started in the late 1990s, KIWA demands that Assi management rehire dozens of fired [[Latino]] and [[Korean people|Korean]] workers who were fired for trying to organize a [[trade union]].

Although initially staffed mostly by ethnic Koreans, KIWA grew to encompass [[Asian-Pacific American]] and [[Latino]] organizers and members. The [[Spanish language]] "''Alianza de trabajadores inmigrantes del Barrio Coreano''" had been in common use since the early 2000s; however the [[English language]] name was officially changed in March 2006 from ''Korean Immigrant Workers Advocates'' to ''Koreatown Immigrant Workers Alliance''. The [[Korean language]] "한인노동상담소" (Korean Worker's Center) has been changed to 한인타운 노동연대 to signify its geographical focus rather than on an ethnic group.

KIWA is a member organization of [http://www.miwon.org MIWON (Multi-Ethnic Immigrant Workers Alliance] [http://www.miwon.org]), an alliance of four (formerly five) immigrant workers' centers in the [[Los Angeles, California|Los Angeles]] area, and [[ENLACE]], a U.S.-[[Mexico]] network of [[Worker center|workers' centers]].

The '''law of carriage of goods by sea''' is a body of law that governs the rights and duties of shippers, carriers and consignees of marine cargo.&lt;ref&gt;''The Law of Carriage of Goods by Sea'' (2011) - L.Singh&lt;/ref&gt;  

Primarily concerned with '''[[cargo claim]]s''', this body of law is an aspect of [[international commercial law]] and [[maritime law]].

==Cargo claims==
{{Main|freight claim}}
[[Consignee]]s (or indeed any lawful holder of the [[bill of lading]])&lt;ref&gt;Bill of lading, or sea way bill or ship's delivery order: Carriage of Goods by Sea Act 1992 ss.1 &amp; 2&lt;/ref&gt; who wishes to make a cargo claim because their goods are substandard or have been lost or damaged at sea, typically have four options: 
* They may sue the '''seller''', the '''shipper''', or the '''carrier'''; or they may claim from their own '''insurance policy'''.
* A suit will lie against the seller if the seller has insufficient title,&lt;ref&gt; Sale of Goods Act1979 (as amended), section 12&lt;/ref&gt; or the goods are not of satisfactory quality,&lt;ref&gt; Sale of Goods Act1979 (as amended), section 14&lt;/ref&gt; or do not comply with sample&lt;ref&gt; Sale of Goods Act1979 (as amended), section 15&lt;/ref&gt; or description.&lt;ref&gt; Sale of Goods Act1979 (as amended), section 13&lt;/ref&gt;
* A suit will lie against the shipper if the goods are damaged through insufficient packing,&lt;ref&gt;Hague Visby Rules Art. IV Rule 2(n)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Goodwin v Lamport and Holt'' [1929] All ER 623&lt;/ref&gt; or if any loss is suffered through insufficient labelling.&lt;ref&gt;Hague Visby Rules Art. III&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Parsons v New Zealand Shipping'' [1901] KB 548&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Bunge v Brasil'' [2009] 2 Lloyds Rep 175  &lt;/ref&gt;
* A suit will lie against the carrier if the damage occurred aboard ship.&lt;ref&gt;Hague-Visby Rules Arts. II &amp; III&lt;/ref&gt; The carrier's [[Protection and indemnity insurance|P&amp;I Club]] cover will normally bear the cost.
* If the cargo is damaged where the shipper without fault (e.g. if the goods have been properly packed and stowed) or if the carrier is either blameless or exempted from liability&lt;ref&gt;Hague-Visby Rules Art IV&lt;/ref&gt;  (e.g. because of '[[Act of God]]' or '[[Deviation (law) |Justifiable Deviation]]'), &lt;ref&gt;''The Teutonia'' (1872) LR 4 PC 171&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''The Al Taha'' [1990] 2 LL R 117&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;	''Stag Line v Foscolo, Mango &amp; Co'' [1932] AC 328&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;''Scaramanga v Stamp'' (1880) 5 CPD 295&lt;/ref&gt; a cargo-owner will have to claim on his own cargo policy.
A claim having been paid, the assured's rights of claim will be [[Subrogation|subrogated]] to the insurer, who may consider proceeding against a party who has caused the damage.

A [[Ship-owner|shipowner]] may sue a [[Chartering (shipping)#Charter types|time-charterer]] or [[Chartering (shipping)|voyage-charterer]] in the event of breach of contract. For instance, if the charterer exceeds [[laytime]], [[demurrage]] will have to be paid; and if the charterer cannot comply with a [[Laytime|Notice of Readiness]] (NOR), the shipowner may [[Anticipatory repudiation|repudiate]] (cancel) the contract of carriage and claim [[damages]] for any loss.&lt;ref&gt;[[Maredelanto Compania Naviera SA v Bergbau-Handel GmbH]]|''The Mihalis Angelos''&lt;/ref&gt;

==Carriage conventions==
In most contracts of carriage the carrier has greater bargaining power than the shipper, and in the 19th century English judges developed rules to protect the weaker parties.&lt;ref&gt;''M'Andrew  v Adams'' (1834) 1 Bing NC 29&lt;/ref&gt; Beginning with the [[Hague Rules]], the various conventions set out to codify and develop such [[common law]] principles by providing an international set of basic standards to be met by the carrier, with a view to establishing a universal framework of legal rights and duties. In practice, however, the level of protection was actually reduced because of new provisions allowing the carrier to (i) limit his liability, and (ii) rely on a wide array of exemptions from liability &lt;ref&gt;...such as "[[Act of God]]", "[[Perils of the Sea]]" and "[[negligence]] in navigation or management of the ship").&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;e.g. Hague-Visby Rules Art. IV (1) &amp; (2)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Principles of the Carriage of Goods by Sea'' -Paul Todd&lt;/ref&gt; Also, whereas up until about 1885,&lt;ref&gt;''The Glenfruin'' (1885) 10 PD 103&lt;/ref&gt; the carrier's duties were deemed to be [[Strict liability|strict]], by 1905 the duty became one of "[[reasonable care]]" or "[[due diligence]]" only.&lt;ref&gt;''McFadden v Blue Star Line'' [1905] 1 KB 697&lt;/ref&gt;

The Hague Rules of 1924 effectively [[Codification (law)|codified]], albeit in a diluted form, the English common law rules to protect the cargo owner against exploitation by the carrier. Nearly 50 years later, the [[Hague-Visby Rules|Hague-Visby]] "update" made few changes, so that the newer Rules still applied only to "tackle to tackle" carriage (i.e. carriage by sea) and the [[Intermodal container|container]] revolution of the 1950s was virtually ignored. The Hague-Visby Rules both excluded cabotage carriage, and declared that deck cargo and live animals were not to be considered as "goods" (although the  [[Carriage of Goods by Sea Act 1971]] provided that cabotage, deck cargo and live animals are to be covered in English contracts). 

The enormous list of exemptions to liability in Article IV made the Rules seem biased in favour of the carrier. As a result, The United Nations produced its own Hamburg Rules which were both more modern and fairer to cargo-owners; but while these have been enthusiastically adopted by developing nations, the wealthier ship-owning nations have stuck to Hague-Visby. In 2008 the final text of the Rotterdam Rules was agreed at [[UNCITRAL]].&lt;ref&gt; UNCITRAL: United Nations Commission of International Trade Law.&lt;/ref&gt;  These Rules are very extensive, with over 90 Articles against 11 in Hague-Visby.  Although the Rotterdam Rules are up-to-date and address multimodal carriage, they have, nine years later, yet to be in force.  It now seems doubtful that the Rotterdam Rules will ever be adopted, but there is a slim possibility that a cut-down version of the Rules ("Rotterdam Lite") might find favour.

China has effectively adopted the Hague Rules. The USA, which tends to shun conventions and instead rely on homespun legislation, has its own [[statutes]]. These comprise the Carriage of Goods by Sea Act (a mildly updated version of the Hague Rules for goods in foreign commerce), and the [[Harter Act]] (for mostly domestic carriage).&lt;ref&gt;Lexolology report [https://www.lexology.com/library/detail.aspx?g=04c1704f-05cd-4dc5-89c8-bb1a921dd13b]&lt;/ref&gt;

This page lists [[wp:notable|notable]] '''bicycle brands and manufacturing companies''' past and present. This article relates to [[bicycle|pedal cycles]]. [[tricycle]]s  and power assisted cycles but does not include [[Motorcycles]]. For bicycle parts, see [[List of bicycle part manufacturing companies]].

Many bicycle brands do not manufacture their own product, but rather import and re-brand bikes manufactured by others (e.g., [[Nishiki (bicycle)|Nishiki]]), sometimes designing the bike, specifying the equipment, and providing quality control. There are also brands that have, at different times, been manufacturers as well as [[badge engineering|re-branders]]: a company with manufacturing capability may market models made by other (overseas) factories, while simultaneously manufacturing bicycles in-house, for example, high-end models.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Keep on Bikin’: American-Made Bikes Making a Comeback|url=http://www.utne.com/Environment/Keep-on-Biking-American-Made-Bikes-Making-Comeback.aspx|publisher=www.utne.com|accessdate=7 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Only brands or manufacturers that are notable as a bicycle brand should be included. If no page exists for the company or brand, then the page to be linked to should be created first or a reference provided as to its notability or the entry will probably be removed.

=== Nippon Professional Baseball owners ===
In Japanese baseball, teams are traditionally owned by companies and bear that company's name. Only one team in recent years has not borne a corporate name—the Yokohama BayStars went without a corporate name from 1993 through 2011 because its owner chose not to attach its name to the team. The company identifier is indicated in '''bold''' type in the owner list.

A '''Loss Attributing Qualifying Company''' (LAQC) was a type of company which, by [[New Zealand]] law, passed on any losses to its [[shareholder]]s. The shareholders could then offset these losses against their personal income for tax purposes.

Following the [[2010 New Zealand budget]], legislation passed was December 2010 that made changes to the rules for qualifying companies (QCs) and loss attributing qualifying companies (LAQCs).&lt;ref name="IRD Budget 2010"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://taxpolicy.ird.govt.nz/news/2010-05-20-budget-tax-bill-introduced|publisher=[[Inland Revenue Department (New Zealand)|Inland Revenue]]|title=Budget Tax Bill Introduced|date=20 May 2010|accessdate=29 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

LAQCs were not able to attribute losses to shareholders for income years starting on or after 1 April 2011 and there are no new QC or LAQC elections. 
Existing LAQCs automatically became QCs (without the ability to attribute losses) at the start of the income year starting 1 April 2011.

They may elect either to remain a QC or can transition into a [[Look-through company]] (LTC) at no tax cost in certain circumstances or can also transition into another tax entity, such as a [[partnership]], [[limited partnership]] or sole tradership with no tax cost.&lt;ref name="IRD Budget 2010" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2959">'''Maths-Olov Sundqvist''' (October 23, 1950 - September 23, 2012) was a Swedish [[entrepreneur]] and [[business magnate]]. Sundqvist was one of Sweden's wealthiest individuals, but in the wake of the [[2007–2012 global financial crisis|financial crises of 2008]], he was forced to sell most of his possessions at huge losses.&lt;ref name="DN 2012"&gt;[http://www.dn.se/ekonomi/maths-o-sundqvist-dod Maths O. Sundqvist död], Dagens Nyheter, September 23, 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

==Life and career ==
Sundqvist was born in 1950 in [[Offerdal]] in [[Krokom]] municipality in [[Sweden]].&lt;ref&gt;Sveriges befolkning 1990. Sundqvist, Maths O.&lt;/ref&gt; He began his business career by developing his father's bus company and finally selling it in 1979 to the municipality of [[Östersund]] for 8.7 million [[Swedish kronor]].&lt;ref name="resume"&gt;[http://www.resume.se/nyheter/media/2012/09/23/lts-raddare-dod/ LT:s räddare död] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120925053453/http://www.resume.se/nyheter/media/2012/09/23/lts-raddare-dod/ |date=2012-09-25 }}, Resume, September 24, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; He used the proceeds to found his personal investment company ''Skrindan'', which grew aggressively to become a big player in real estate.&lt;ref name="resume"/&gt; In 1992, he rescued the local newspaper ''Länstidningen'' in [[Östersund]] as it fell into financial difficulties. In 2002 he controlled a majority stake at the ''Länstidningen'',&lt;ref name="resume"/&gt; as well as several other local companies.&lt;ref name="DN 2012"/&gt;

Sundqvist was ranked in 2007 by the Swedish business magazine the ''[[Affärsvärlden]]'' as one of Sweden's wealthiest individuals after his acquisition of large blocks of shares in a number of Swedish corporations such as [[Hexagon AB|Hexagon]], Fabege, Industrivärden and [[Svenska Cellulosa Aktiebolaget|SCA]]. In 2008, his total portfolio was worth 10.4 billion Swedish kronor, and his portfolio of real estate was worth 7-8 billion Swedish kronor.&lt;ref name="Aftonbladet 2012"&gt;[http://www.aftonbladet.se/incoming/article15490179.ab Maths O. Sundqvist hittad död], Aftonbladet, September 23, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; 

Due to declining stock prices during the 2008 financial crisis, Sundqvist was forced to sell large blocks of shares to refinance loans. Sundqvist had more than a billion in debts at the [[Carnegie Investment Bank]], and was a contributing factor that the bank lost its banking license and was taken over by the [[Swedish National Debt Office]].&lt;ref name="resume"/&gt; As Sundqvist was forced to sell most of his shares, he suffered huge losses.&lt;ref name="DN 2012"/&gt;

==Death ==
Sundqvist died in 2012. He was found dead next to his [[all-terrain vehicle]] near his residence in [[Häggenås]], north of [[Östersund]]. He was 61.&lt;ref name="Aftonbladet 2012"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8290">A '''MEPS (Minimum Energy Performance Standard)''' is a specification, containing a number of performance requirements for an [[energy]]-using device, that effectively limits the maximum amount of energy that may be consumed by a product in performing a specified task.

A MEPS is usually made mandatory by a government energy efficiency body. It may include requirements not directly related to energy; this is to ensure that general performance and user satisfaction are not adversely affected by increasing energy efficiency.

A MEPS generally requires use of a particular test procedure that specifies how performance is measured.

In [[North America]] when addressing energy efficiency, a MEPS is sometimes referred to simply as a “standard”, as in “Co-operation on [[Collaborative Labeling and Appliance Standards Program (CLASP)|Labeling and Standards Programs]]”.  In [[Latin America]] when addressing energy efficiency, MEPS are sometimes referred to as ''Normas'' (translated as "norms").

==Examples==
* A [[refrigerator|refrigerating appliance]] is required to maintain [[temperature]]s inside its compartments within specified limits, and to operate (including defrosting) in a specified ambient temperature while using at most a specified amount of [[electricity]]; the energy use allowed varies according to volume, number of doors, the function of the various compartments and other parameters.  This graph shows the dramatic reduction in electricity use in U.S. refrigerators following the introduction of a series of first California then U.S. MEPS starting in the mid-1970s:

[[Image:kwh per frig.jpg|thumb|frame|right|Price, volume and efficiency of refrigerators]]
* An [[electric fan]] is required to shift air at a specified rate while consuming a limited amount of power.
A storage [[water heater]] providing hot water for sanitary purposes is required to heat up a specified quantity of water to a specified temperature and store it at that temperature for a specified time while consuming a limited amount of energy.  In this example, the requirements for heating up and for maintaining the temperature may be applied as two separate energy performance requirements or there may be a single task efficiency. 
* An electric [[induction motor]] is required to have a specified minimum full-load efficiency.
A [[compact fluorescent lamp]] is required to start and run up to near full [[brightness]] in a given time, to have a minimum life of several thousand hours, to maintain its output within specified limits, to withstand a certain number of switchings, to have a consistent colour appearance and a specified colour rendering.  Its energy performance requirement is usually stated in terms of minimum efficacy (light output per electrical input).

==California==
In the U.S., the state of [[California]] was a pioneer &lt;ref&gt;http://www.eceee.org S. Nadel S., 2003, Appliance &amp; equipment efficiency standards in the US: Accomplishments,next steps and lessons learned, ECEEE 2003 Summer Study, St Raphael.&lt;/ref&gt; in the introduction of MEPS. In order to reduce the growth in electricity use, the [[California Energy Commission]] (CEC)  was given unique and strong authority to regulate the efficiency of appliances sold in the state.  It started to adopt appliance efficiency regulations in 1978, and has updated the standards regularly over time, and expanded the list of covered appliances. 

In 1988, California's standards became national standards for the U.S. through the enactment of the [[National Appliance Energy Conservation Act]] (NAECA).  The federal standards preempted state standards (unless the state justified a waiver from federal preemption based on conditions in the state), and since then, the U.S. Department of Energy has had the responsibility to update the federal standards. 

California has continued to expand the list of appliances it regulates for appliances that are not federally regulated, and therefore not preempted.  In recent years,{{When|date=April 2014}} the CEC's attention has been focused on consumer electronics, for which energy use has been growing dramatically.

==Australia==
MEPS programs are made mandatory in [[Australia]] by state government legislation and regulations which give force to the relevant Australian Standards. It is mandatory for the following products manufactured in or imported into Australia to meet the MEPS levels specified by the relevant Australian Standards:

A law was approved in 2001.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iea.org/Textbase/work/2007/neet_brasilia/Leonelli.pdf Energy Efficiency in Brazil.] Paulo Augusto Leonelli, Brazilian Ministry of Mines and energy. November 20, 2007&lt;/ref&gt; MEPS have been set for three-phase electric motors and [[compact fluorescent lamps]].

==New Zealand==
On 5 February 2002, [[New Zealand]] introduced Minimum Energy Performance Standards (MEPS) with Energy Efficiency Regulations.
MEPS and energy rating labels help improve the energy efficiency of our{{Who|date=April 2014}} products, and enable consumers to choose products that use less energy.  Products covered by MEPS must meet or exceed set levels for energy performance before they can be sold to consumers.
MEPS have been updated over the years (2002, 2003, 2004, 2008, 2011) to cover a wide range of products, and increasing levels of stringency. [[New Zealand]] works with Australia to harmonise MEPS levels. Almost all of its standards are joint standards with Australia.
New Zealand has mandatory Energy rating labelling for dishwashers and clothes dryers, fridges, washing machines and room air conditioners. 
MEPS apply to the following:&lt;ref&gt;Energy Efficiency and Conservation Authority of New Zealand http://www.eeca.govt.nz/standards-and-ratings/minimum-energy-performance-standards-and-labelling&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Nemawashi''''' (根回し) in [[Japanese language|Japanese]] means an informal process of quietly laying the foundation for some proposed change or project, by talking to the people concerned, gathering support and feedback, and so forth. It is considered an important element in any major change, before any formal steps are taken, and successful ''nemawashi'' enables changes to be carried out with the consent of all sides.

''Nemawashi'' literally translates as "going around the roots", from [[wikt:根|根]] (''ne'', root) and 回す (''mawasu'', to go around [something]). Its original meaning was literal: digging around the roots of a tree, to prepare it for a transplant.  This process involves bringing the dirt from the new location, and introducing it to the tree, before the transplant, so the tree can grow accustomed to the new environment before it gets there.

''Nemawashi'' is often cited as an example of a Japanese word which is difficult to translate effectively, because it is tied so closely to [[Japanese culture]] itself, although it is often translated as "laying the groundwork."

In Japan, high-ranking people expect to be let in on new proposals prior to an official meeting.  If they find out about something for the first time during the meeting, they will feel that they have been ignored, and they may reject it for that reason alone.  Thus, it’s important to approach these people individually before the meeting.  This provides an opportunity to introduce the proposal to them and gauge their reaction.  This is also a good chance to hear their input.  This process is referred to as ''nemawashi''.&lt;ref&gt;''Rochelle Kopp'' (2012).

An '''online media cooperative''' is an autonomous association of similar businesses or organizations who voluntarily join together around an online media platform for their mutual and individual benefit. The businesses in an online media cooperative are typically within the same industry ex: drug stores, pet stores, pizza shops and are located within a geographic region or nationally. The online media typically takes the form of a video, video series, or some other creative work that is outside the funding abilities of an individual business. The media elevates or otherwise promotes the core mission of the businesses in the shared industry in a manner that benefits the members of the cooperative individually.

The platform aspect of the cooperative allows for the unique, individual identification of each member in the cooperative based on some type of geographic location mechanism. This mechanism could be based on physical address, IP address, or proximity/attachment to short-range wireless communication systems such as Apple's [[iBeacon]] using mobile telecommunications devices such as cell phones, tablet computers or traditional computer equipment.

The intent of an online media cooperative is to improve the business environment of local stores and organizations. The [[disintermediation]] that the Internet brought about has benefitted consumers and businesses typically at the expense of small local businesses. The cooperative allows hundreds or thousands of these small businesses to join together in an economically affordable way to produce entertaining media that serves as a regional or national outreach program. This online media attracts an audience around the topic/mission and, when it and the overall online media platform is produced properly, creates a concerned and engaged "viewer" who is significantly more likely to conduct business with the local cooperative member.

'''Orion Pictures Corporation''' is an American [[List of film production companies|motion picture producer]] and [[Film distributor|distributor]] that produced and released films from 1978 until 1999 and was also involved in television production and syndication throughout the 1980s until the early 1990s. It was formed in 1978 as a [[joint venture]] between [[Warner Bros.]] and three former top-level executives of [[United Artists]]. Although it was never a large motion picture producer, Orion achieved a comparatively high reputation for [[Hollywood]] quality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title= Whither Orion? : The Last of the Mini-Major Studios Finds Itself at a Crossroads|publisher= [[The Los Angeles Times]]|date=1990-07-19|url= http://articles.latimes.com/1990-07-19/entertainment/ca-363_1_studio-executives|accessdate=2010-12-28|first=Nina J.|last=Easton}}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Woody Allen]], [[James Cameron]], [[Jonathan Demme]], [[Oliver Stone]], and several other prominent directors worked with Orion during its most successful years from 1978 to 1992. Of the films distributed by Orion, four won [[Academy Award]]s for [[Academy Award for Best Picture|Best Picture]]: ''[[Amadeus (film)|Amadeus]]'' (1984), ''[[Platoon (film)|Platoon]]'' (1986), ''[[Dances with Wolves]]'' (1990), and ''[[The Silence of the Lambs (film)|The Silence of the Lambs]]'' (1991).&lt;ref name="variety" /&gt;  Two other Orion films, ''[[Hannah and Her Sisters]]'' (1986) and ''[[Mississippi Burning]]'' (1988), were nominated for that same category.

In 2013, [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer]] revived the Orion name for television; a year later, Orion Pictures was relaunched by the studio.

==History==

===Beginnings: 1978–1981===
In January 1978, three executives of [[Transamerica Corporation|Transamerica]] (TA)-owned studio [[United Artists]] (UA) – [[Arthur B. Krim]] (chairman), [[Eric Pleskow]] (president and chief executive officer), and [[Robert S. Benjamin]] (chairman of the finance committee) - quit their jobs. Krim and Benjamin had headed UA since 1951, and subsequently turned around the then-flailing studio with a number of critical and commercial successes. Change had begun once Transamerica purchased UA in 1967, and within a decade a rift formed between Krim and TA chairman Jack Beckett regarding the studio's operations. Krim suggested spinning off United Artists into a separate company, which was rejected by Beckett.&lt;ref name="may"&gt;Medavoy and Young, pp. 83-90&lt;/ref&gt;

The last straw came for Pleskow when he refused to collect and deliver the medical records of UA department heads to Transamerica's offices in San Francisco for the sake of confidentiality. The tensions only worsened when ''Fortune'' magazine reported an article on the clash between UA and TA, in which Beckett had stated that if the executives disliked the parent company's treatment of them, they should resign.&lt;ref name="may" /&gt; Krim, Benjamin, and Pleskow quit United Artists on January 13, 1978, followed by the exits of senior vice presidents William Bernstein and [[Mike Medavoy]] three days later. The week following the resignations, according to the website ''Reference for Business'', "63 important Hollywood figures took out an advertisement in a trade paper warning UA that it had made a fatal mistake in letting the five men leave. The 'fatal mistake' came true following the box office disaster of ''[[Heaven's Gate (film)|Heaven's Gate]]''"&lt;ref name="RFB"&gt;[http://www.referenceforbusiness.com/history2/48/ORION-PICTURES-CORPORATION.html "Orion Pictures Corporation."] ''Reference for Business''&lt;/ref&gt; which led to Transamerica selling UA to [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Champlin |first1=Charles |title=That's a Wrap: End of MGM/UA That Was |url=http://articles.latimes.com/1990-11-20/entertainment/ca-5110_1_mgm-lot |accessdate=2013-08-16 |work=Los Angeles Times |date=November 20, 1990}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 1978, the five men forged a deal with [[Warner Bros.]] The executives formed Orion Pictures Company, named after [[Orion (constellation)|the constellation]], which they claimed had five main stars (it actually has seven/eight). The new company intended only to finance projects, giving the filmmakers complete creative autonomy; this ideal was implemented with great success at United Artists.  Orion held a $100 million line of credit, and its films would be distributed by the [[Warner Bros.]] studio. Orion, however, was contractually given free rein over distribution and advertising, as well as the number and type of films the executives chose to invest in.&lt;ref&gt;Medavoy and Young, pp. 95-97&lt;/ref&gt;

In late March 1978, Orion signed its first contract; a two-picture deal with [[John Travolta]]'s production company. Contracts with actress and director [[Barbra Streisand]]; actors [[James Caan (actor)|James Caan]], [[Jane Fonda]], [[Peter Sellers]], [[Jon Voight]], and [[Burt Reynolds]]; directors [[Francis Ford Coppola]] and [[Blake Edwards]]; writer/director [[John Milius]]; singer [[Peter Frampton]]; and producer [[Ray Stark]] soon materialized.&lt;ref name="RFB" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Associated Press. [https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=HbssAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=LxMEAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=4846,4749317&amp;dq=orion+pictures&amp;hl=en "Top Stars Join Orion Pictures"] ''Wilmington Morning Star'' (November 22, 1978; page 10-A). Retrieved November 2, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; Orion also developed a co-financing and distribution deal with [[EMI Films]].&lt;ref name="RFB" /&gt; In its first year, Orion had 15 films into productions plus were in production, and had a dozen more actors, directors and producers line up to sign up with Orion.&lt;ref name="RFB" /&gt;

In 1979, Benjamin died. Orion's first film, ''[[A Little Romance]]'',&lt;ref&gt;Medavoy and Young, p. 104&lt;/ref&gt; was released in April that year. That year, Orion released [[Blake Edwards]]' ''[[10 (film)|10]]'', which became a big critical and commercial success; the first for Edwards in over a decade (aside from installments of ''[[The Pink Panther (film series)|The Pink Panther]]'' franchise). Other films released in that period included ''[[Caddyshack]]''; ''[[The Great Santini]]'', a critically praised but underpromoted adaptation of a [[Pat Conroy]] novel; and ''[[Promises in the Dark (film)|Promises in the Dark]]''. Out of the 23 films Orion released between April 1979 and December 1981, only a third of them made a profit.&lt;ref&gt;Medavoy and Young, p. 115&lt;/ref&gt; Orion executives were conflicted over financing big-budgeted films and passed on ''[[Raiders of the Lost Ark]]'' for that reason.&lt;ref&gt;Medavoy and Young, p. 114-115&lt;/ref&gt;

===Acquisition of Filmways: 1981–1983===
By early 1982, Orion had severed its distribution ties with Warner. As part of the deal, the rights to Orion's films made up to that point were sold to Warner. Orion was now looking to have its own distribution network by acquiring another company with such capabilities. The four partners looked into [[Monogram Pictures|Allied Artists]] and [[Embassy Pictures]]&lt;ref&gt;Medavoy and Young, p. 122&lt;/ref&gt; before settling on [[Filmways]].&lt;ref name=aic&gt;{{cite book|last=Tzioumakis|first=Yannis|title=AMERICAN INDEPENDENT CINEMA|year=2006|publisher=Edinburgh University Press|location=Edinburgh|pages=228–229}}&lt;/ref&gt; Orion subsequently purchased Filmways and reorganized the flailing company. New employees were hired and all of Filmways' non-entertainment assets ([[Grosset &amp; Dunlap]] and [[Broadcast Electronics]]) were sold off.&lt;ref name="RFB" /&gt;&lt;ref name=aic/&gt; On August 31, 1982, Filmways was renamed as Orion Pictures Corporation.

Another result of the merger was that Orion entered television production. Orion's biggest TV hit was ''[[Cagney &amp; Lacey]]'', which lasted seven seasons on CBS. In 1983, Orion Pictures introduced art-house division [[Orion Classics]] with executives who had previously run [[United Artists|United Artists Classics]].&lt;ref name=aic/&gt;

===Problems arise: 1984–1986===
According to ''Reference for Business'': "Of the first 18 movies the company had released as Orion Pictures Corporation, ten had been profitable, five had broken even, and three had losses of less than $2 million."&lt;ref name="RFB" /&gt; One such film, [[Francis Ford Coppola]]'s ''[[The Cotton Club (film)|The Cotton Club]]'', was mired in legal troubles and Orion lost $3 million of its investment.&lt;ref name="RFB" /&gt; '"We've had some singles and doubles [but haven't] had any home runs," lamented Krim.&lt;ref name="RFB" /&gt; In September 1984, Orion distributed ''[[Amadeus (film)|Amadeus]]'', which garnered many accolades, winning eight [[Academy Awards]], including [[Academy Award for Best Picture|Best Picture]].&lt;ref name="RFB" /&gt;

For Orion, 1985 was a dismal year. All but two films, ''[[Desperately Seeking Susan]]'' and ''[[Code of Silence (film)|Code of Silence]]'', made less than $10 million in the United States box office, including an unsuccessful attempt at a [[James Bond]]-type franchise, ''[[Remo Williams: The Adventure Begins]]''.&lt;ref name="RFB" /&gt; Orion's haphazard distribution channels and unsuccessful advertising campaigns made it impossible to achieve a hit. Another factor was that Orion was about to venture into the video business and stopped selling off home use rights to its films. Furthermore, production of the [[Rodney Dangerfield]] comedy ''[[Back to School]]'' was put on hold when a co-producer died, taking the film off of its Christmas 1985 release slate.&lt;ref name="nyc"&gt;Kornbluth, Jesse (April 6, 1987). ''The Little Studio that Could'' (pp. 48-54). ''[[New York Magazine]]''.&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 1986, [[Mario Kassar]] and [[Andrew Vajna]], producers of the ''[[Rambo (film series)|Rambo]]'' films (the first film, ''[[First Blood (film)|First Blood]]'', was distributed by Orion) attempted to buy $55 million worth of the studio's stock through the duo's company, [[Carolco Pictures|Anabasis]]. Had they succeeded, Kassar and Vajna would have controlled the board and laid off every executive save for Krim.&lt;ref name="nyc" /&gt; Warburg Pincus subsequently limited its 20% stake in Orion to 5%; the remaining stocks were acquired by [[Viacom (original)|Viacom International]].&lt;ref name="RFB" /&gt; Viacom hoped to use Orion's product for its pay-TV channel [[Showtime (TV network)|Showtime]].&lt;ref&gt;Medavoy and Young, p. 181.&lt;/ref&gt; Orion expanded into home video distribution with the formation of Orion Home Entertainment Corporation.&lt;ref name="RFB" /&gt;

===Metromedia era: 1986–1991===
On May 22, 1986, [[Metromedia]], a television and communications company controlled by billionaire (and a friend of Krim's) [[John Kluge]], which had just divested of its television station group to [[Rupert Murdoch]]'s [[News Corporation]] (which would form what is now the [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox network]]), purchased a 6.5% stake in Orion. Kluge's investment in the company came at the right time- ''Back to School'' was a success and ultimately earned $90 million at the box office.&lt;ref name="RFB" /&gt; By March 1987, the studio's fortunes increased dramatically with a succession of critical and commercial hits, including ''[[Platoon (film)|Platoon]]'' (which ultimately won a Best Picture Oscar), Woody Allen's ''[[Hannah and Her Sisters]]'', and the sports film ''[[Hoosiers (film)|Hoosiers]]''. Orion's 1986 offerings totaled 18 Academy Award nominations, more than any other studio.&lt;ref name="RFB" /&gt; In 1987, Orion achieved further success with ''[[RoboCop]]'', and ''[[No Way Out (1987 film)|No Way Out]]''.&lt;ref name="RFB" /&gt; By this time, Orion's television division had expanded into the lucrative syndicated game show market under the name ''Century Towers Productions'', in reference to Orion's street address at the time. It produced revivals of format inherited from [[Heatter-Quigley Productions]] after the Filmways merger (as Filmways had previously acquired HQ in the late 1960s); this included ''[[Hollywood Squares|The New Hollywood Squares]]'', which ran from 1986 to 1989, and a revival of ''[[High Rollers]]'' which aired in the 1987-88 season.

In January 1987, Kluge faced big competition with the arrival of [[Sumner Redstone]]. His theater chain, [[National Amusements]], purchased 6.42 percent of the company's stock. National Amusements later acquired Viacom, increasing their Orion stake at 21%, then 26%. Soon Kluge started buying more Orion stock, leading to him and Redstone battling it out to take over the company.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title= COMPANY NEWS; Orion Pictures Stake Increased|work= The New York Times|date=1987-12-17|url= https://www.nytimes.com/1987/12/17/business/company-news-orion-pictures-stake-increased.html?scp=1&amp;sq=Orion%20Pictures&amp;st=cse|accessdate=2010-08-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title= A 6.5% Stake In Orion Pictures|work= The New York Times|date=1986-06-03|url= https://www.nytimes.com/1986/06/03/business/a-6.5-stake-in-orion-pictures.html?scp=7&amp;sq=Orion%20Pictures&amp;st=cse|accessdate=2010-08-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kluge ultimately succeeded when Metromedia took over approximately 67% of Orion on May 20, 1988, effectively giving him control of the studio.&lt;ref name="RFB" /&gt; One analyst commented on the takeover to the ''Wall Street Journal'': "This amount is probably so small to Kluge it doesn't matter. He probably burns that up in a weekend."&lt;ref name="RFB" /&gt;

In 1989, Orion suffered from a disastrous slate of films, placing themselves dead last among the major Hollywood studios in terms of box office revenue. Among its biggest flops that year were ''[[Great Balls of Fire! (film)|Great Balls of Fire!]]'', the biography of [[Jerry Lee Lewis]] starring [[Dennis Quaid]] and [[Winona Ryder]]; ''[[She-Devil (film)|She-Devil]]'', a dark comedy starring [[Meryl Streep]] and [[Roseanne Barr]]; and [[Miloš Forman]]'s adaptation of ''[[Les Liaisons dangereuses]]'', ''[[Valmont (film)|Valmont]]'', which competed with ''[[Dangerous Liaisons]]'', also based on the same source material. Test screenings of the [["Weird Al" Yankovic]] comedy ''[[UHF (film)|UHF]]'' were so strong that Orion had high expectations for it. It flopped at first,&lt;ref name="RFB" /&gt; but it has since attained a strong cult following.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite AV media notes

In February 1990, Orion signed a deal with [[Columbia Pictures|Columbia Pictures Entertainment]] in which the much larger studio would pay Orion $175 million to distribute Orion's movies and television programs overseas. Orion had previously licensed its films to individual distributors territory by territory.&lt;ref name="RFB" /&gt; That same month, Mike Medavoy left Orion and became head of [[Tri-Star Pictures]].&lt;ref&gt;Medavoy and Young, p. 201&lt;/ref&gt;

1990 was just as dismal for Orion as the year prior, with such failures as ''[[The Hot Spot]]'' and ''[[State of Grace (1990 film)|State of Grace]]''. The only bright spot that year was [[Kevin Costner]]'s western epic ''[[Dances with Wolves]]''. It won seven Academy Awards, including Best Picture,&lt;ref name="wb"&gt;{{cite news|title= BUSINESS PEOPLE; Chief at Orion Pictures Is Joining Paramount|work= The New York Times|date=1992-02-21|url= https://www.nytimes.com/1992/02/21/business/business-people-chief-at-orion-pictures-is-joining-paramount.html?scp=4&amp;sq=Orion%20Pictures&amp;st=cse|accessdate=2010-08-08 | first=Anthony | last=Ramirez}}&lt;/ref&gt; and grossed $400 million worldwide. A few months later, Orion garnered another winner with ''[[The Silence of the Lambs (film)|The Silence of the Lambs]]'', but these two films could not make up for years of losses. Only Kluge's continued infusions of cash were enough to keep the company afloat, but soon he had enough.

===Bankruptcy: 1991–1995===
After failing to sell Orion to businessman (and former 20th Century Fox owner) [[Marvin Davis]] ([[Sony]], which had recently purchased [[Columbia Pictures]] was also interested&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title= COMPANY NEWS; Orion Pictures' Stock Increases|work= The New York Times|date=1991-02-09|url= https://www.nytimes.com/1991/02/09/business/company-news-orion-pictures-stock-increases.html?scp=5&amp;sq=Orion%20Pictures&amp;st=cse|accessdate=2010-08-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;), Kluge took drastic steps. First, Orion shut down production. Second, Kluge ordered the sale of several projects, such as ''[[The Addams Family (1991 film)|The Addams Family]]'' (which went to [[Paramount Pictures|Paramount]], though the international rights to the film were retained by Orion), in order to accumulate much-needed cash. Finally, in the spring of 1991, Kluge's people took over the company, leading to the departure of Arthur Krim.&lt;ref&gt;Medavoy and Young, pp. 202-203.&lt;/ref&gt; Orion's financial problems were so severe, that at the 63rd Annual Academy Awards in March 1991, host [[Billy Crystal]] made reference to the studio's debt in his opening monologue, joking that "''[[Reversal of Fortune]]'' [is] about a woman in a coma, ''[[Awakenings (film)|Awakenings]]'' [is] about a man in a coma; and ''Dances with Wolves'' [was] released by Orion, a studio in a coma."&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x0lWrZL0EHE Billy Crystal Oscars Opening -- 1991 Academy Awards.] [[The Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences]]-YouTube Channel. Retrieved on June 11, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

It was during this time that [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] stepped in to co-finance and assume production over many of Orion TV's shows it had in production, such as ''[[American Detective]]'' and ''[[Equal Justice (TV series)|Equal Justice]]''.

On November 25, 1991, Orion sold its ''[[Hollywood Squares]]'' format rights to [[King World Productions]] after Orion closed down its television division.&lt;ref name="broadcasting19911125"&gt;{{cite journal|date=1991-11-25|title=King Gets the Square |journal=Broadcasting|page=26}}&lt;/ref&gt; On December 11, 1991, Orion filed for [[Chapter 11 bankruptcy]] protection.&lt;ref name="RFB" /&gt;

In December 1991, Orion was in talks with [[New Line Cinema]], a successful independent film company, to acquire the bankrupt studio. By the following April, Orion and New Line Cinema cancelled their plans on the issue of price. [[Republic Pictures]] and the then-new [[Savoy Pictures]] also attempted to buy Orion, but no deal materialized.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title= THE MEDIA BUSINESS; New Line Breaks Off Talks On Buying Orion Pictures|work= The New York Times|date=1992-04-22|url= https://www.nytimes.com/1992/04/22/business/the-media-business-new-line-breaks-off-talks-on-buying-orion-pictures.html?scp=6&amp;sq=Orion%20Pictures&amp;st=cse|accessdate=2010-08-08 | first=Richard W. | last=Stevenson}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title= COMPANY NEWS; 2d Company Makes Bid for Orion Pictures|work= The New York Times|date=1992-04-10|url= https://www.nytimes.com/1992/04/10/business/company-news-2d-company-makes-bid-for-orion-pictures.html?scp=2&amp;sq=Orion%20Pictures&amp;st=cse|accessdate=2010-08-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the Academy Awards ceremony, broadcast on March 30, 1992, Crystal yet made another reference to Orion, this time about its demise: {{cquote|Take a great studio like Orion: a few years ago Orion released ''Platoon'', it wins Best Picture. ''Amadeus'', Best Picture. Last year, they released ''Dances with Wolves'' wins Best Picture. This year ''The Silence of the Lambs'' is nominated for Best Picture. And they can't afford to have another hit! But there is good news and bad news. The good news is that Orion was just purchased, and the bad news is it was bought by the House of Representatives.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UCAi1744Sa0 Billy Crystal Oscars Opening -- 1992 Academy Awards.] [[The Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences]]-YouTube Channel. Retrieved on June 11, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

''The Silence of the Lambs'' swept all five major Academy Awards; however, a majority of key executives, as well as the talent they had deals with, had left the studio. Hollywood observers had doubts that Orion would be resurrected to its former glory.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title= Orion Pictures' Losses Widen|work= The New York Times|date=1992-04-08|url= https://www.nytimes.com/1992/04/08/business/orion-pictures-losses-widen.html?scp=8&amp;sq=Orion%20Pictures&amp;st=cse|accessdate=2010-08-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On November 5, 1992, Orion reemerged from bankruptcy. Its reorganization plan would allow for Orion to continue producing and releasing films, but financing for the features would be provided by outside sources, with the studio purchasing the distribution rights to them after their completion.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://variety.com/1992/biz/news/orion-emerges-from-chapter-11-100780/|title=Orion emerges from Chapter 11|last=Brennan|first=Paul Noglows, Judy|date=1992-11-06|work=Variety|access-date=2017-05-25|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://yahoo.brand.edgar-online.com/displayfilinginfo.aspx?FilingID=343274-5759-53456&amp;type=sect&amp;tabindex=2|title=EDGAR Pro|website=yahoo.brand.edgar-online.com|access-date=2017-05-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Orion's bankruptcy also delayed the release of many films the studio had produced or acquired, among them: ''[[Love Field (film)|Love Field]]'' (1992), ''[[RoboCop 3]]'' (1993), ''[[The Dark Half (film)|The Dark Half]]'' (1993), ''[[Blue Sky (film)|Blue Sky]]'' (1994), ''[[Car 54, Where Are You? (film)|Car 54, Where Are You?]]'' (1994), ''[[Clifford (film)|Clifford]]'' (1994), ''[[The Favor]]'' (1994), and ''[[There Goes My Baby (film)|There Goes My Baby]]'' (1994). Orion started releasing these films after their reorganization. ''Blue Sky'' won star [[Jessica Lange]] an Academy Award for Best Actress in 1995.

===Metromedia International Group===
In November 1995, Orion and three other companies controlled by Kluge were merged to form the Metromedia International Group.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1995/11/02/business/the-media-business-actava-group-seals-stock-swap.html|title=THE MEDIA BUSINESS;Actava Group Seals Stock Swap|last=Bloomberg Business News|first=|date=1995-11-02|work=|newspaper=The New York Times|issn=0362-4331|access-date=2016-11-01|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Few of the films released during the four years after [[Chapter 11, Title 11, United States Code|bankruptcy protection]] were successful either critically or commercially.

In 1996, Metromedia acquired production company [[Motion Picture Corporation of America]], and installed its heads, Brad Krevoy and Steve Stabler, as co-presidents of Orion. Both received a six picture put picture distribution deal as a part of their contracts.&lt;ref name=lat&gt;{{cite news|last1=Horn|first1=John|title=Coming soon, to very few theaters|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2005/feb/21/entertainment/et-mgm21|accessdate=June 10, 2016|work=Los Angeles Times|date=February 21, 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the years ahead, Orion produced very few films, and primarily released films from other producers, including [[Artisan Entertainment|LIVE Entertainment]]. [[Orion Classics]], minus its founders (who had moved to [[Sony Pictures|Sony Pictures Entertainment]] and founded [[Sony Pictures Classics]]), continued to acquire popular [[art-house]] films, such as ''[[Boxing Helena]]'' (1993), before Metromedia merged the subsidiary with [[The Samuel Goldwyn Company|Samuel Goldwyn Entertainment]] in 1996.

===Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer subsidiary===
In July 1997, Metromedia shareholders approved the sale of Orion (as well as Samuel Goldwyn Entertainment and [[Motion Picture Corporation of America]]) to [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer]]. This led to the withdrawal of 85 employees, including Krevoy and Stabler, while 111 other employees were to be laid off within nine months, leaving 25 of them to work at MGM. Orion also brought with it, a two thousand film library, ten completed movies and five direct-to-video features for future release&lt;ref name=vty1&gt;{{cite news | last = Weiner | first = Rex | date = July 11, 1997 | title = MGM ends Orion orbit | url = https://variety.com/1997/film/news/mgm-ends-orion-orbit-1116676950/ | newspaper= Variety | location     =  | access-date  = Jun 10, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and the Krevoy and Stabler movie put picture distribution deal.&lt;ref name=lat/&gt; Krevoy and Stabler retained the right to the Motion Picture Corporation of America name and their three top movies. Metromedia retained Goldwyn Entertainment's Landmark Theatre Group.&lt;ref name=vty1/&gt;  ''[[One Man's Hero]]'' (1999) was the last film released by Orion for 15 years.

MGM kept Orion intact as a corporation thus to avoid its Warner Bros. video distribution agreement and began distributing Orion Pictures films under the Orion Home Video label. MGM acquired the 2/3 of pre-1996 [[PolyGram Filmed Entertainment]] library from [[Seagram]] in 1999 for $250&amp;nbsp;million, increasing their library holdings to 4,000. The PolyGram libraries were purchased by its Orion Pictures subsidiary so as to avoid its 1990 video distribution agreement with Warner.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Eller|first=Claudia |title=MGM Agrees to Acquire PolyGram Movie Library|date=23 October 1998|newspaper=[[Los Angeles Times]] |url=http://articles.latimes.com/1998/oct/23/business/fi-35357 |accessdate=29 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In March 1999, MGM bought out its distribution contract with Warner Bros. for $225 million, effectively ending the distribution problem.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.thefreelibrary.com/MGM+REGAINS+VIDEO+RIGHTS%253B+$225+MILLION+DEAL+TO+HELP+SELL+DVDS.-a083605917|title=MGM REGAINS VIDEO RIGHTS; $225 MILLION DEAL TO HELP SELL DVDS. - Free Online Library|website=www.thefreelibrary.com|access-date=2018-04-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2013, MGM revived the Orion Television brand (after Orion's original TV unit was shut down during its bankruptcy era in the early 1990s) as Orion TV Productions with a new syndicated series, ''[[Lauren Lake's Paternity Court|Paternity Court]]''.&lt;ref name=vty0&gt;{{cite news|last1=Saval|first1=Malina|title=MGM TV Rides High With ‘Vikings’ and ‘Fargo’|url=https://variety.com/2014/tv/festivals/mgm-tv-rides-high-with-vikings-and-fargo-1201152961/|accessdate=October 28, 2015|work=Variety|issue=April 1, 2014|publisher=Penske Business Media, LLC|date=April 4, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Orion Pictures name, also as Orion Releasing, was extended in fourth quarter 2014 for smaller multi-platform video on demand and limited theatrical distribution. Its name was first seen again on September 10, 2014 in front of the trailer for ''[[The Town That Dreaded Sundown (2014 film)|The Town That Dreaded Sundown]]'' that was released in October. The label's first release was the Brazilian film ''Vestido pra Casar''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Torrelio|first1=Sebastian|title=Orion Pictures Label Returns for First Time in 15 Years|url=https://variety.com/2014/film/news/orion-pictures-label-returns-for-first-time-in-15-years-1201304184/|accessdate=March 10, 2017|work=Variety|date=September 11, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 2015, [[Entertainment One Films]] relaunched the [[Momentum Pictures]] banner with an announced deal with Orion Pictures to co-acquire and co-distribute films in the United States and Canada, and selected foreign markets, such as the [[United Kingdom]] (Momentum's country of origin). The initial films under the deal were ''[[The Wannabe]]'', ''[[Fort Tilden (film)|Fort Tilden]]'' and ''[[Balls Out (2014 film)|Balls Out]]''.&lt;ref name=hwr&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/tiff-eone-relaunches-momentum-pictures-821351|title=TIFF: eOne Relaunches Momentum Pictures Label With Orion Releasing Deal|newspaper=The Hollywood Reporter|access-date=2016-11-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other films released by Orion Pictures and [[Momentum Pictures]] include ''[[Pocket Listing (film)|Pocket Listing]]'' and ''[[Diablo (2015 film)|Diablo]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last=Kay | first=Jeremy | url=http://www.screendaily.com/news/production/shoot-wraps-on-pocket-listing/5065176.article | title=Shoot wraps on Pocket Listing | website=ScreenDaily | date=January 8, 2014 | accessdate=February 9, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last=Busch | first=Anita | title=Orion Pictures Picks up ‘Pocket Listing’ For Limited Theatrical Release | url=http://deadline.com/2016/11/pocket-listing-theatrical-release-2016-rob-lowe-burt-reynolds-1201848696/ | website=Deadline | date=November 4, 2016 | accessdate=February 9, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Hollywood Reporter"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Vlessing|first1=Ethan|title=Scott Eastwood's 'Diablo' Nabbed by Orion Releasing, Momentum|url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/scott-eastwoods-diablo-nabbed-by-840589|accessdate=18 March 2016|work=[[The Hollywood Reporter]]|date=16 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2017, Orion TV added another court series, ''Couples Court'', to its syndicated line up. The show is presided over by a husband wife team and deals with marital issues primarily cheating.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Desk|first1=TV News|title=Orion Television's COUPLES COURT Coming to National Syndication This Fall|url=http://www.broadwayworld.com/bwwtv/article/Orion-Televisions-COUPLES-COURT-Coming-to-National-Syndication-This-Fall-20170113#|accessdate=March 10, 2017|website=Broadway World|publisher=Wisdom Digital Media|date=January 13, 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On September 6, 2017, MGM officially revitalized the Orion Pictures brand as a standalone, US theatrical marketing and distribution arm with the hiring of John Hegeman, who had come from [[Blumhouse Productions|Blumhouse Tilt]] (distributor of Orion's ''[[The Town That Dreaded Sundown (2014 film)|The Town That Dreaded Sundown]]'' and ''[[The Belko Experiment]]'') and incidentally got his start working at the old Orion in the 1980s. Hegeman will serve as president of the expanded label and report to [[Jonathan Glickman]], president of MGM's motion picture group. Under his leadership, the "new" Orion will produce, market and distribute four to six modestly budgeted films a year across genres and platforms, both wide and limited releases for targeted audiences, and its first release, the young adult romance drama ''[[Every Day (2018 film)|Every Day]]'', was released in February 23, 2018.&lt;ref name="variety"&gt;{{cite web|author=Dave McNary |url=https://variety.com/2017/film/news/mgm-re-launching-orion-pictures-distributor-1202548889/ |title=MGM Relaunching Orion Pictures as Distributor |work=Variety |date=2017-09-06 |accessdate=2018-01-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="thr"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/mgm-relaunches-orion-pictures-under-john-hegeman-1035761 |title=MGM Relaunches Orion Pictures Under John Hegeman |work=The Hollywood Reporter |date= |accessdate=2018-01-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="deadline"&gt;{{cite web|last=Busch |first=Anita |url=http://deadline.com/2017/09/orion-pictures-relaunched-mgm-john-hegeman-president-1202162614/ |title=Orion Label Relaunched By MGM As Stand-Alone; John Hegeman President |website=Deadline |date=2017-09-06 |accessdate=2018-01-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Nick Romano |url=http://ew.com/movies/2017/12/06/angourie-rice-every-day-first-look-photos/ |title=Angourie Rice stars in Every Day movie first-look photos |website=EW.com |date=2017-12-06 |accessdate=2018-01-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 2018, it was announced the [[Orion Classics]] would be revived as a multiplatform distribution label, with 8 to 10 films being released per year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/mgm-relaunches-orion-classics-as-multiplatform-distribution-label-1113714|title=MGM Relaunches Orion Classics as Multiplatform Distribution Label|website=[[The Hollywood Reporter]]|first=Pamela|last=McClintock|date=May 21, 2018|accessdate=May 21, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Orion's library today===
Almost all of Orion's post-1982 releases, as well as most of the AIP and Filmways backlogs and all of the television output originally produced and distributed by Orion Television, now bear the MGM name. However, in most cases, the 1980s Orion logo has been retained or added, in the case of the Filmways and AIP libraries.

Most ancillary rights to Orion's back catalog from the 1978–1982 joint venture period remain with Warner Bros., including such movies as ''[[10 (film)|10]]'' (1979), ''[[Caddyshack]]'' (1980), ''[[Arthur (1981 film)|Arthur]]'' (1981), ''[[Excalibur (film)|Excalibur]]'' (1981), and ''[[Prince of the City (film)|Prince of the City]]'' (1981). Some post-1982 films originally released by Orion &amp;mdash; ''[[Lionheart (1987 film)|Lionheart]]'' (1987), ''[[The Unbearable Lightness of Being (film)|The Unbearable Lightness of Being]]'' (1988), and ''[[Amadeus (film)|Amadeus]]'' (1984) (the latter two being [[Saul Zaentz]] productions) &amp;mdash; are currently distributed by Warner Bros. as well. [[HBO]] also owns video distribution rights to ''[[Three Amigos]]'' (1986), which co-produced the film and owns pay-TV rights. However, MGM owns all other rights and the film's copyright.{{citation needed|date=December 2012}} ''[[The Wanderers (1979 film)|The Wanderers]]'' is owned by the film's producers; however, the copyright is held by MGM/Orion.

Woody Allen's films ''[[A Midsummer Night's Sex Comedy]]'' (1982) and ''[[Zelig]]'' (1983) are the only Orion films from the original joint venture period now owned by MGM. Orion releases produced by the [[Hemdale Film Corporation]] and [[Barry Spikings|Nelson Entertainment]] are included in MGM's library as well, and are incorporated into the Orion library. MGM via [[PolyGram|Polygram Entertainment]] did not acquire the Hemdale films, (which include ''The Terminator'', ''Hoosiers'',  and ''Platoon'') or the Nelson films (including the ''Bill &amp; Ted'' films), until MGM via Polygram Entertainment bought the pre-1996 library of PolyGram Filmed Entertainment, which included both companies' libraries, although the television and digital rights to certain Nelson films are now held by [[Paramount Television]], with television syndication handled on behalf of Paramount Television by [[Trifecta Entertainment &amp; Media]].

Many of the film and television holdings of [[The Samuel Goldwyn Company]] have now also been incorporated into the Orion library (with ownership currently held by MGM), and the copyright on some of this material is held by Orion, except ''[[Flipper (1995 TV series)|The New Adventures of Flipper]]'' now carries the MGM Television Entertainment copyright.{{citation needed|date=December 2012}}

MGM still holds distribution rights to the 1980s revival of ''[[The Hollywood Squares|Hollywood Squares]]'' and ''[[High Rollers]]'' the company produced, as well as the remnants of the Heatter-Quigley library that was not erased, including all remaining episodes of the original ''Squares''; they do not own the rights to the format, which is currently owned by [[CBS Television Distribution]], successor-in-interest to King World, who purchased the format rights in 1991 and produced another syndicated revival from 1998 to 2004.

Orion distributed the first [[Rambo (film series)|Rambo film]], ''[[First Blood]]'' (1982).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Maslin|first=Janet|title=First Blood (1982) 'FIRST BLOOD'|date=22 October 1982|publisher=''[[The New York Times]]''|url=https://www.nytimes.com/movie/review?res=9E0DE0DB143BF931A15753C1A964948260|accessdate=24 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; That film, like the rest of the ''Rambo'' franchise, is now owned by [[StudioCanal]] as a result of purchasing the library of its co-distributor, [[Carolco Pictures]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Lambie|first=Ryan|title=The rise and fall of Carolco|date=11 March 2014|url=http://www.denofgeek.us/movies/carolco/233689/the-rise-and-fall-of-carolco|accessdate=24 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
From 1975 to 1979, Gontha worked for [[Citibank N.A.]], where he became assistant vice president.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Primadhyta|first1=Safyra|title=Dianggap Berjasa, Peter Gontha Raih Penghargaan dari Citibank|url=https://www.cnnindonesia.com/ekonomi/20170710221043-92-226946/dianggap-berjasa-peter-gontha-raih-penghargaan-dari-citibank|accessdate=23 October 2017|publisher=CNN Indonesia|date=10 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; He later became vice president of [[American Express Bank]] for Asia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Peter F.

Gontha founded Indonesia’s first commercial television network, [[Rajawali Citra Televisi Indonesia]] (RCTI), in 1989 as part of Bimantara Group, and co-founded the country's second commercial television network, [[Surya Citra Televisi]] (SCTV) in 1990, followed by satellite pay TV company [[Indovision]] in 1994.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Gontha Assumes Reins for Lippo Media Company|url=http://jakartaglobe.id/archive/gontha-assumes-reins-for-lippo-media-company/|accessdate=21 October 2017|agency=Jakarta Globe|date=18 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1996, he purchased a controlling stake in the English-language daily newspaper, ''The Indonesian Observer''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Peter Gontha Masuk ''Indonesian Observer''|url=https://www.library.ohio.edu/indopubs/1996/09/15/0038.html|accessdate=26 March 2018|publisher=Suara Pembaruan|date=14 September 1996}}&lt;/ref&gt; His media empire and ambitions earned him the nickname, “the [[Rupert Murdoch]] of Indonesia”.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Indonesia Media Baron Expands His Horizon|url=https://www.library.ohio.edu/indopubs/1996/10/10/0071.html|accessdate=21 October 2017|publisher=AsiaOne Business Times|date=10 October 1996}}&lt;/ref&gt; His public profile increased when he began hosting an Indonesian version of ''[[The Apprentice (TV series)|The Apprentice]]'' in 2005, leading to him being dubbed “the Indonesian [[Donald Trump]]”. Gontha, who is known for his baldness, has dismissed the comparison as nonsense, saying he is just a hard worker who looks nothing like Trump.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Peter Frans Gontha, Pencetus Java Jazz, Sekadar Jongos|url=https://koran.tempo.co/konten/2013/03/03/302664/Peter-Frans-Gontha,-Pencetus-Java-JazzSekadar-Jongos|accessdate=21 October 2017|publisher=Koran Tempo|date=3 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He was a co-founder of petrochemical firm PT Chandra Asri Indonesia. His other business ventures included Plaza Indonesia Realty (The Grand Hyatt Jakarta), PT Tri Polyta Indonesia, First Media, Bali Intercontinental Resort, P.T. Datakom Asia and P.T.

'''''Quote''''' is a [[Netherlands|Dutch]] [[magazine]] with editorial offices based in [[Amsterdam]], notable for publishing the ''[[:nl:Quote 500|Quote 500]]'', a list of the 500 wealthiest people in the [[Netherlands]] together with their relative financial position, similar to the list produced by ''[[Forbes (magazine)|Forbes]]''.

''Quote'' is published monthly and provides information about [[business]], [[money]], [[career]]s, [[social network|networks]] and lives of people at the top. In December 1999, the magazine was named "Magazine of the Year" by the ''Nederlandse Uitgeversbond'' (Dutch Publishers Association). First published in November 1986, and named for a term for a [[stock price]], ''Quote'' was sold by the founder, [[Maarten van den Biggelaar]], and two friends to [[Hachette Filipacchi Médias]] (HFM) on July 21, 2006. Editor [[Jort Kelder]] then stepped down in April 2007 after more than thirteen years at the helm.

In November 2002, ''Quote'' published the first picture of real estate speculator [[Willem Endstra]] together with released felon [[Willem Holleeder]], who had served a prison sentence as the convicted [[Kidnapping of Freddy Heineken|kidnapper]] of beer magnate [[Freddy Heineken|Alfred Heineken]]. The two were sitting on a bench outside Endstra's offices in the [[Amsterdam Oud-Zuid]] borough. Endstra, who had always denied his links with the underworld, filed for a [[preliminary injunction]] demanding that ''Quote'' be withdrawn from sale. He said he feared for his safety. Initially, his claim was upheld, but a few days later the injunction was overturned. Endstra was murdered two years later, and Holleeder was reimprisoned after having been convicted on a charge of extortion.

In November 2003, the editor of ''Quote'' was shot; the culprit was never found. A few days earlier, the home of Van den Biggelaar was shot at as well.

In January 2005, ''Quote'' was in the headlines with a claim that in 1998, [[Nina Brink]], the founder of [[World Online]], a Dutch [[Internet service provider]], had been involved in a premeditated [[sex scandal]] and was forced to resign. Brink announced that she would take legal action, but failed to bring a lawsuit. A declaration that she subsequently filed with the Amsterdam public prosecutor to support her [[libel]] claim was declared inadmissible in May due to the lack of solid legal basis.

On 1 November 2011, Mirjam van den Broeke succeeded Sjoerd van Stokkum as the new editor. Former editor Jort Kelder temporarily returned to the business magazine as advisor to the new editor. Since November 2016 Sander Schimmelpenninck has been the editor.

'''Raul Gardini''' (1933 - 1993) was an [[Italy|Italian]] businessman. In 1980 he took the helm of his father in law Serafino Ferruzzi's family wealth, leading an aggressive campaign that led to the acquisition of the French sugar and paper company Beghin-Say SA, turning Ferruzzi into Europe's leading sugar producer. In 1985, Gardini focused his interest on chemicals and bought stock in the Montedison chemicals group. By 1987, he had acquired 42 per cent of the group, turning Ferruzzi-Montedison into Italy's second largest industrial group after the state-owned company [[Eni]]. In 1989 Eni and Montedison formed a joint-venture called Enimont.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.independent.co.uk/news/people/obituary-raul-gardini-1486771.html&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1992 Gardini built a sailing team to compete in the [[America's Cup]]. [[Paul Cayard]] was hired as manager and skipper, leading [[Il Moro di Venezia]] to win the [[1992 Louis Vuitton Cup]].

In 1993 Gardini was embroiled in the [[Tangentopoli]] scandal following a failed power bid to take control of Enimont and died by a dubious suicide in [[Milan]].

'''Servicios Industriales de la Marina S.A.''' (Shipyard Marine Industrial Services), well known as '''SIMA''' or '''SIMA PERU S.A.''', is a Peruvian [[shipyard]] that operates as a state owned company established under private law in 1950 pursuing the activities of the former Naval Factory founded in 1845, and continually extending its operational capacity, first to the shipbuilding which SIMA pioneered in [[South America]] and then to the greatest metalworking structures manufacture, contributing to the defense and socio-economic development of Peru. The SIMA principally serve the [[Navy of Peru]] as well as domestic and foreign private clients through a wide range of products.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.sima.com.pe/ace_empresa_eng.asp|title=SIMA, the company|publisher=sima.com.pe|date=August 14, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
On May 22, 1845 during the first government of President [[Ramón Castilla]], the State Factory in the city of [[Callao]] was established. Then named Naval Factory, this facility would become a leading establishment of its kind in South America. Such decision to establish this factory was due to the fact that Peru had taken steps to acquire the steamship "Rimac", first steam warship of the national navy at that time in the year of 1844, making it necessary to have an establishment where maintenance and repair could be provided.&lt;ref name=pt1&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.sima.com.pe/ace_historia_eng.asp|title=History´s SIMA|publisher=sima.com.pe|date=August 14, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:BAP Humboldt.jpg|thumb|left|250px|[[B.I.C. Humboldt]], Peruvian oceanographic research vessel built in 1978 by SIMA.]]
On August 7, 1861 by orders of the President of the Republic, General Juan Antonio Pezet, the Naval Factory was entirely taken over by the Navy, arranging the creation of the Naval Factory Superintendence, thus achieving performance optimization. Years later the Naval Factory made history participating in the construction of the first South American armored ship monitor "Victoria" and the conversion of steamship "Loa" into an armored vehicle; installing machinery, artillery and hull armor. Both ships were part of the national fleet that confronted the Spanish fleet during the naval [[Battle of Callao]] in 1866.&lt;ref name=pt1/&gt;

During the [[War of the Pacific|Pacific War]] the Naval Factory was actively engaged in the national efforts to confront the military conflict meeting the requirements of both the Navy and the Army. Unfortunately, at the end of the war, its facilities were destroyed after heroic efforts of men to serve even under the most difficult circumstances, thereby constituting the oldest record of what SIMA is today.&lt;ref name=pt1/&gt;

In the post war years, few of the ships possessed by the Navy were repaired in the state-owned floating dock of the "Compañía Peruana de Vapores y Dique del Callao" until 1930, date on winch it sank, forcing the Navy to send its ships to the Panama Canal zone, among other foreign shipyards.&lt;ref name=pt1/&gt;
[[File:BAP Mariategui Panamax 2004.jpg|thumb|right|250px|[[BAP Mariátegui (FM-54)|BAP Mariátegui]], frigate built in 1984 by SIMA.]]
In a situation of dependence on foreign shipyards, the Navy of Peru took up again naval repair activities to serve their small-sized vessels, creating the Naval Station of San Lorenzo in 1921. In 1925, with the arrival of submarines Type "R", the Naval Station of San Lorenzo was modernized installing machinery at the workshops and a modern shipyard with capacity of 800 tns bollard pull, inaugurated with the entry of torpedo-boat destroyer "Rodriguez".&lt;ref name=pt1/&gt;

On February 14, 1950 during the government of [[Manuel A. Odría]], Servicios Industriales de la Marina (Marine Industrial Services) known as SIMA was created over the base of the Industrial Department of the Navy Dockyard, assigning the dry dock administration and workshops in order to serve the Peruvian Navy, the National Merchant Marine and private entities successfully. With creation of SIMA under administration of the Navy, the decision to get into the shipbuilding activity was made. Preparation of the shipyard for that purpose began. Berth number one, mould-loft, shipbuilding workshop among others were constructed.&lt;ref name=pt1/&gt;

On March, 25th 1999 Law N° 27073 was enacted, regulating activities of the company within the scope of the defense sector and paying particular attention to the Navy of Peru as well as individuals customers in order to generate profits to self-finance its own development and fulfill its role in society.&lt;ref name=pt1/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1607">'''STAR Lager''' is a Nigerian beer produced by [[Nigerian Breweries]].

==History== 
After the end of World War II, [[United Africa Company|UAC]] under the leadership of [[Frank Samuel]] promoted the establishment of a beer company in Nigeria. In November 1946, UAC in partnership with [[Heineken International|Heineken]] established Nigerian Breweries Ltd. In June 1949, STAR lager was introduced into the Nigerian market.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=[written|last2=eBizguides]|first2=edited by|title=Nigeria : the premier guidebook for business globe trotters|date=2005|publisher=EBizguides|location=Dublin|isbn=9788493397838|page=179}}&lt;/ref&gt; The newly introduced Nigerian beer brand with white bubbling foam faced some risk as it was in competition with foreign beer brands, whiskey and [[palm wine]]. STAR gained market ground and in 1960 was the market leader and recognizable at parties and ceremonies.

===Promotion===
At its early history STAR lager was promoted as a home made brand with international standards. In 1954, the brand won the bottled beer category at the British Empire and Commonwealth Bottled Beer Competition. In the 1970s,the brand was affiliated with sponsorship of the Nigerian Chess Championship, Table Tennis Competition and a cycling competition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=STAR Beer is 30 Years Young|journal=Drum (Nigeria ed.)|date=June 1979|page=21}}&lt;/ref&gt; The advertising agency used during the period was LINTAS.

The '''Spanish property bubble''' is the collapsed overshooting part of a long-term price increase of Spanish [[real estate]] prices. This long-term price increase has happened in various stages from 1985 up to 2008.&lt;ref&gt;La burbuja inmobiliario-financiera en la coyuntura económica reciente (1985-1995). {{ISBN|978-84-323-0913-7}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;

Coinciding with the [[financial crisis of 2007–08]], prices began to fall. In 2013, Raj Badiani, an economist at IHS Global Insight in London, estimated that the value of residential real estate has dropped more than 30 percent since 2007 and that house prices would fall at least 50 percent from the peak by 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/2013-03-19/spanish-banks-cut-developers-as-zombies-dying-mortgages.html | work=Bloomberg | first1=Sharon | last1=Smyth | first2=Rob | last2=Urban | title=Spanish Banks Cut Developers as Zombies Dying: Mortgages | date=2013-03-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Alcidi and Gros note,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.voxeu.org/article/whats-wrong-spain&lt;/ref&gt; “If construction were to continue at the still relatively high rate of today, the process of absorption of the bubble would take more than 30 years.”

== Dynamics ==
House ownership in Spain is above 80%. The desire to own one's own home was encouraged by governments in the 1960s and '70s, and has thus become part of the Spanish psyche. In addition, tax regulation encourages ownership: 15% of mortgage payments are deductible from personal income taxes. Further, the oldest apartments are controlled by non-inflation-adjusted rent-controls&lt;ref&gt;

As feared, when the [[Economic bubble|speculative bubble]] popped, Spain became one of the worst affected countries. According to [[eurostat]], over the June 2007-June 2008 period, Spain has been the European country with the sharpest plunge in construction rates.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.elpais.com/elpaismedia/ultimahora/media/200808/20/espana/20080820elpepunac_1_Pes_PDF.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-09-27 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090320111018/http://www.elpais.com/elpaismedia/ultimahora/media/200808/20/espana/20080820elpepunac_1_Pes_PDF.pdf |archivedate=2009-03-20 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; 
In 2008, new constructions came virtually to a halt, but prices were initially relatively stable with sellers reluctant to offer large discounts. The national average price as of late 2008 was 2,095 euros/m2&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cotizalia.com/cache/2008/08/28/noticias_50_900000_viviendas_construidas_inmobiliario_estan.html]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.globalpropertyguide.com/Europe/Spain |title=Recent history of the Spanish residential property market |publisher=Global Property Guide}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Actual sales over the July 2007-June 2008 period were down an average 25.3% (with the lion's share of the loss arguably happening in the 2008 tract of this period). Some regions have been more affected than others ([[Catalonia]] was ahead in this regard with a 42.2% sales plunge while sparsely populated regions like [[Extremadura]] were down a mere 1.7% over the same period).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lavanguardia.es/lv24h/20080923/53544998493.html]&lt;/ref&gt;

Unlike much of the United States, Spain does not recognize mortgage loans as [[nonrecourse debt]]. Since property prices dropped enough for most foreclosures to only account for 60% of the loan, those evicted have large debts for property they no longer own.&lt;ref&gt;

== Figures ==

=== Prices and number of houses built ===
According to the reports of the [[Bank of Spain]], between 1976 and 2003, the price of housing in Spain has doubled in real terms, which means, in nominal terms, a multiplication by 16. In the period of 1997—2006, the price of housing in Spain had risen about 150% in nominal terms, equivalent to 100% growth in real terms. It is stated that from 2000 to 2009, 5 million new housing units had been added to the existing stock of 20 million.&lt;ref&gt;Bardhan, A., Edelstein, R. &amp; Kroll, C. (2011), [https://books.google.com/books?id=VVEvNclICcgC&amp;dq=Bardhan,+A.,+Edelstein,+R.+%26+Kroll,+C.+2011,+&amp;hl=es&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s "The Financial Crisis and Housing Markets Worldwide"] in ''Global Housing Market: Crises, Policies, and Institutions''&lt;/ref&gt; In 2008, the real estate market started to drop fast, and house prices decreased dramatically by 8% in that year.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.economist.com/node/12725415 "Spain's Property Crash: Builders' Nightmare"], 2008, ''The Economist''&lt;/ref&gt; In the period of 2007-2013, Spanish house prices had fallen by 37%.&lt;ref&gt;Karaian, J. 2013, [http://qz.com/124088/spanish-real-estate-has-lost-more-than-a-third-of-its-value-but-its-still-overvalued ''The Pain in Spain''], Quartz&lt;/ref&gt; Each year almost a million homes were built in Spain, more than in Germany, France, and England altogether.&lt;ref&gt;[http://topspanishhomes.com/blogs/some-facts-about-spanish-housing-bubble]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Real estate debt ===
[[Image:Spanishdebt.jpg|thumb|right|300px|The housing bubble was fed by the credit to private sector (individuals and developers), which led to a significant increase in private debt (blue) stopped with the international financial crisis, ending the speculative process.]]
One of the main effects of this situation is the growth of [[household debt]]. Since usually the purchase of housing, whether to live or to invest, is made from mortgage loans, the price increase implies an increase in debt. The indebtedness of the Spanish tripled in less than ten years. In 1986, debt represented 34% of disposable income, in 1997 it rose to 52%, and in 2005 it came to 105%. In 2006, a quarter of the population was indebted with maturities of more than 15 years.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nodo50.org/ramonfd/tsunami_urbanizador.pdf "El tsunami urbanizador"], pág 24 y sig.&lt;/ref&gt; From 1990 to 2004, the average length of mortgages increased from 12 to 25 years.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cablegatesearch.net/cable.php?id=05MADRID1088&amp;q=spain Spain's Booming Housing Market And The Uncertain Future]&lt;/ref&gt; The Bank of Spain reported that household savings in 2006 has been overwhelmed by debt.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.elmundo.es/mundodinero/2007/08/15/economia/1187164139.html Diario El Mundo: El pago de deudas se 'comió' en 2006 todo el nuevo ahorro de las familias españolas.]&lt;/ref&gt;

In fact, the Bank of Spain has warned each year about the high indebtedness of Spanish households,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.consumer.es/web/es/economia_domestica/2003/05/15/61428.php Año 2003: el Banco de España alerta...], [http://www.cincodias.com/articulo/empresas/Banco/Espana/alerta/subida/riesgo/hipotecario/cdscdi/20041112cdscdiemp_41/Tes/ Año 2004: el Banco de España alerta...], [http://www.finanzas.com/id.9066477/noticias/noticia.htm "Año 2006: el Banco de España alerta..."]&lt;/ref&gt; which according to the institution was unsustainable. The private debt stood at 832.289 billion euros at the end of 2006, an increase of 18.53% year-on-year, and reached 1 trillion euros by the end of 2010.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.elperiodicodearagon.com/noticias/noticia.asp?pkid=316007 El Periódico de Aragón.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100911022430/http://www.elperiodicodearagon.com/noticias/noticia.asp?pkid=316007 |date=2010-09-11 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Bank of Spain also warned on the excessive indebtedness of the construction industry.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.elconfidencial.com/economia/noticia.asp?id=8822 "Alerta del Banco de España a las contructoras"], '' El Confidencial''&lt;/ref&gt;

President of the Chambers of Commerce of Spain, Javier Gómez Navarro, said at an event organized by the Association of Financial Journalists, entities "never recover" 30% of the debt owed to the housing sector. According to the Bank of Spain, this debt amounted to 325,000 million euros as of December 2009 was 96.824 million in bad loans.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.elpais.com/articulo/economia/deuda/ladrillo/castigara/banca/Camaras/Comercio/elpepueco/20100310elpepieco_8/Tes "La deuda del ladrillo castigará a la banca, según las Cámaras de Comercio"], ''El País'', March 10, 2010&lt;/ref&gt; The president of the Chambers regretted that the Spanish financial system did not admit the impact of the crisis on their assets, as well as the Bank of Spain, which affirmed that it was the responsibility of the whole financial sector: "In Spain, it was never wanted to recognize that the financial system was not in good shape, as this would have forced the banking sector to start re-capitalising policies. The goal of the state's policy has so far been to gain time, to start a mild bank recapitalisation, but time is now running out".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.intereconomia.com/noticias-negocios/finanzas-personales/politica-economica/gomez-navarro-alerta-que-los-bancos-pueden- "Gómez Navarro cree que los bancos pueden 'quedarse' con el dinero del ICO"] ''Intereconomía''&lt;/ref&gt;

According to R.R. de Acuna &amp; Asociados, a real-estate consulting firm, more than half of the country’s 67,000 developers can be categorized as “zombies”, having liabilities that exceed their assets and only enough income to repay the interest on their loans.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/2013-03-19/spanish-banks-cut-developers-as-zombies-dying-mortgages.html | work=Bloomberg | first1 =Sharon | last1=Smyth | first2=Rob | last2=Urban | title= Spanish Banks Cut Developers as Zombies Dying: Mortgages | date=2013-03-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;
According to the Bank of Spain, the rate of household doubtful loans among the total amount of credit increased from 0.8% in 2005 to 6.2% in 2011.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.craig.csufresno.edu/International_Programs/JC/IJB/Volumes/Volume%2017/V174-2.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Telkomsel was incorporated on 26 May 1995 in Jakarta, Indonesia. It is majority owned by Telkom Indonesia with 65% of the shares, with [[Singtel|Singapore Telecommunications Limited]] owning the minority 35%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://investing.businessweek.com/research/stocks/private/snapshot.asp?privcapId=1186063l| title=Telkomsel on BusinessWeek|website=Investing.businessweek.com| accessdate=23 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In November 1997, Telkomsel became the first wireless carrier in Asia to introduce rechargeable GSM pre-paid services. In September 2006, Telkomsel became the first carrier in the country to launch a 3G service.

On 20 March 2009, Telkomsel and [[Apple Inc.|Apple South Asia Pte. Ltd.]] launched the [[iPhone 3G]] in Indonesia with customised price plans for all of Telkomsel's customers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.beritateknologi.com/telkomsel-segera-meluncurkan-iphone-3g-resmi-masuk-indonesia/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-12-07 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111217032322/http://www.beritateknologi.com/telkomsel-segera-meluncurkan-iphone-3g-resmi-masuk-indonesia |archivedate=17 December 2011 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Three years later, Telkomsel had acquired more than 100 million active customers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.indonesia-investments.com/business/indonesian-companies/telekomunikasi-indonesia/item201|title=Telekomunikasi Indonesia – Telkom – Indonesia Investments|website=Indonesia-investments.com|accessdate=26 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 2017, the company website was hacked, and a message protesting about high charges and unnecessary extra services was posted. There was widespread support for the hacker on social media.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Telkomsel Hacked, Customers Vent Frustration Over Internet Price | author1 = Dion Bisara |author2 = Herman | publisher = [[The Jakarta Globe]] | date = 18 April 2017 | url = http://jakartaglobe.id/business/telkomsel-hacked-customers-vent-frustation-internet-price/ | access-date = 15 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Windfall Tax''' was a [[tax]] on what were claimed to be "the excess [[Profit (accounting)|profits]] of the privatised [[Public utility|utilities]]"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://archive.treasury.gov.uk/pub/html/budget97/ir1.html |title=1997 Budget |publisher=HM Treasury |accessdate=31 July 2008 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070928040614/http://archive.treasury.gov.uk/pub/html/budget97/ir1.html |archivedate=September 28, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and was introduced by the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour]] government of [[Tony Blair]] in 1997. It followed from their manifesto commitment made during the [[United Kingdom general election, 1997|1997 general election]] campaign to impose a "windfall levy" on the privatised utilities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.politicsresources.net/area/uk/man/lab97.htm|title=New Labour, because Britain deserves better|publisher=Political Science Resources|accessdate= 31 July 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; The tax came after 18 years of [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative]] government, which had seen the privatization of many state-owned assets, at prices which many considered too low. It aimed to "put right the bad deal which customers and taxpayers got from the privatisation of the utilities".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.parliament.the-stationery-office.co.uk/pa/cm199798/cmhansrd/vo970710/text/70710w22.htm|title=House of Commons Hansard Written Answers for 10 Jul 1997 (pt 22)|publisher=UK Parliament|accessdate=31 July 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; The tax produced an estimated one off income to the government of £5 billion, which was used to fund the [[New Deal (UK)|New Deal]], a welfare-to-work program that sought to tackle long-term unemployment, as well as providing capital investment for schools and the [[University for Industry]] (Learndirect).

== The tax ==

The tax was calculated by means of a 9 times [[P/E ratio]], whereby the average post-tax profit in the four years after privatization was multiplied by 9 to give the value for the purposes of the tax. The difference between this value and the total market capitalisation based on the company's flotation price was subject to a 23% "windfall tax". The tax was charged to the company and was payable in two instalments on 1 December 1997 and 1 December 1998.

The companies affected were those privatized by the [[Telecommunications Act 1984]], the Airports Act 1986, the Gas Act 1986, the Water Act 1989, the Electricity Act 1989 (and the Electricity (Northern Ireland) Order 1992) and the Railways Act 1993. The firms affected were [[BAA Limited|BAA]], [[British Energy]], [[British Gas plc|British Gas]] (now BG plc and Centrica), [[British Telecom]], National Power, [[Northern Ireland Electricity]], [[Powergen]], [[Scottish Hydro]], [[Scottish Power]] and [[Railtrack]], the regional electricity companies and the privatized water and sewerage companies (including such companies now forming part of Hyder, [[United Utilities]] and Scottish Power).

Since 1997, no further windfall taxes have been levied in the UK. However, calls have been made for new windfall taxes. The ''[[Financial Times]]'' reported in January 2008 that the government was considering ways of maximising returns to the treasury from the sale of the troubled [[Northern Rock]] bank, which could include a windfall tax or the government taking an equity stake.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://us.ft.com/ftgateway/superpage.ft?news_id=fto012020081805161152&amp;page=2|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110929154905/http://us.ft.com/ftgateway/superpage.ft?news_id=fto012020081805161152&amp;page=2|dead-url=yes|archive-date=2011-09-29|work=Financial Times}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the event, the bank was not sold on to private investors, but instead came under UK government ownership.

== Windfall tax on energy companies ==

Calls were made for a windfall tax on energy companies during the summer of 2008 in the wake of energy price rises and the environmental record of the oil and gas industry.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite newspaper|url=https://www.theguardian.com/business/2008/jul/31/bggroupbusiness.utilities|title=British Gas adds fuel to windfall tax debate|journal=The Guardian|first=Larry|last=Elliott|date=31 July 2008|accessdate=31 July 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/business/news/campaigners-call-for-windfall-tax-on-north-sea-oil-firms-421302.html|title=Campaigners call for windfall tax on North Sea oil firms|work=The Independent|location=London|first=Philip|last=Thornton|date=23 October 2006|accessdate=31 July 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; 120 Labour [[Member of Parliament#United Kingdom|MPs]] supported the call,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/7600899.stm|title=Pressure for windfall tax mounts|work=BBC News|date=6 September 2008|accessdate=6 September 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as columnist for ''[[The Guardian]]'' [[Polly Toynbee]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2008/jul/26/gordonbrown.glasgoweast1|title=Cardiac arrest in Glasgow - and still the clunking mantra|work=The Guardian|location=London|first=Polly|last=Toynbee|date=26 July 2008|accessdate=31 July 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the left-wing pressure group [[Compass (think tank)|Compass]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2008/aug/27/energy.oilandgascompanies1?guni=Article:in%20body%20link|title=Good for the country, good for Labour|work=The Guardian|location=London|first=Zoe|last=Cannon|date=27 August 2008|accessdate=23 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; There were conflicting reports in the media over whether the government was looking into implementing the tax, with suggestions that government ministers were both interested in and opposed to the idea.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/7536814.stm|title=Ministers 'consider' windfall tax|work=BBC News|date=1 August 2008|accessdate=1 August 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.standard.co.uk/news/windfall-tax-wont-avert-fuel-crisis-says-minister-6928082.html|title=Windfall tax won't avert fuel crisis says minister|work=London Evening Standard|first=Paul|last=Waugh|date=28 August 2008|accessdate=4 September 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite the [[BBC]] later reporting in early September that such a windfall tax was "still an option",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/7595960.stm|title=Windfall tax is 'still an option'|work=BBC News|date=3 September 2008|accessdate=4 September 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; then [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|Prime Minister]] [[Gordon Brown]] confirmed at the Labour Party conference later that month that the idea had been scrapped.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/politics/labour/3058774/Labour-Conference-Unions-flex-muscles-over-tax-and-workers-hours.html|title=Labour Conference: Unions flex muscles over tax and workers' hours |work=The Telegraph|location=London|first=James|last=Kirkup|date=22 September 2008|accessdate=23 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The issue was raised again in 2013, led by former Prime Minister [[John Major|Sir John Major]], who described the recent energy price rises of more than 10% "unacceptable", calling for a one-off emergency tax.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite newspaper|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-24621391|title=Sir John Major calls for windfall tax on energy profits|journal=BBC News|date=22 October 2013|accessdate=23 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;
